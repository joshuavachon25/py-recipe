PREFACE BY THE EDITOR. 



After the tennination of the late war of the rebelhon, the 
United States Sanitary Commission resolved to publish a series of 
volumes, with a view to the diffiision and permanent availability 
of important infonnation, acquired during the war, relating to the 
grand object of the labors of the Commission, namely, to lessen the 
evils of warfare as far as possible by the systematic and efficient 
employment of sanitary measures. Much valuable material for 
the proposed volumes had already accumulated in the Historical 
Bureau, consisting of reports and various documents received from 
appointed inspectors and agents, as also from medical officers and 
otliers interested in the labors of the Commission. To this mate- 
rial has been added much obtained by means of a printed circular, 
inviting contributions from all who had had " opportunities for 
special studies in hospitals or in the field," or who had " made pro- 
fessional observations upon any subject connected with military- 
Hygiene, Camp Diseases, and Surgery." In addition, elaborate 
papers have been furnished, upon parsonal application, by members 
of the medical profession, distinguished for researches or large 
experience in the departments of inquiry to which their papers 
relate. These measures and all arrangements connected with the 
preparation of the volumes, have been under the immediate direc- 
tion of the Medical Committee of the Commission, the committee 
consisting of Professor Wm. H. Van Buren, M. D., Cornehus R. 
Agnew, M. D., Elisha Harris, M. D., Professor Wolcott Gibbs, 
M. D., and Professor J. S. Newberry, M. D. — the last-named 
member of the Commission having been recently added to the 
Committee. 

This volume is devoted to topics pertaining to medicine, in a 



vi PREFACE BY THE EDITOR. 

restricted sense of the term ; that is, as distinguished from surgery. 
The larger portion is occupied by Camp Diseases. The Causation 
and the Prevention of Disease form a portion of the volume ; but 
Military Hygiene comprehensively considered, the Construction 
and the Administration of Hospitals, the Transportation of the 
Sick and Wounded, together with other kindred topics, and all 
those which belong to surgery, are assigned to other volumes. 

As regards arrangement of topics, that which suggested itself 
as the most simple and natural, was a division corresponding to 
General and Special Pathology. In accordance with this arrange- 
ment, contributions relating to the Causation and Prevention of 
Disease are embraced in the first section of the volume, and those 
relating to Camp Diseases are embraced in the second section. A 
third and the last section consists of an elaborate Report on the 
Diseases, etc., prevailing among the prisoners confined at Ander- 
sonville, Ga. This Report could not well be divided into separate 
parts, and distributed in the foregoing sections, and it seemed to. 
require a distinct portion of the volume. The author, Professor 
Joseph Jones, was a Confederate medical officer, and the Report 
which is pubhshed in this volume, and which was placed by him at 
the disposal of the Sanitary Commission, is an ofiicial account of 
personal investigations made by authority of the Surgeon-General 
of the Confederate Army. The Report is published as- received 
from the author, no alterations having been made in any part, the 
title-page, the division into chapters, and the headings of the latter 
being included in this statement. Some portions, however, owing 
to the great length of the Report, have be6n omitted, but care has 
been taken that the omissions should not in any way alter its char- 
acter or impair its value. 

It has been the duty of the editor to examine the mass of ma- 
terial relating to the topics belonging properly to this volume, and 
to select therefrom the contributions which form the contents of 
the volume. It is proper to state that in the performance of this 
duty, there have been no restrictions placed upon him by the Med- 
ical Committee of the Commission, and that he is therefore alone 
responsible for the manner in which the duty has been performed. 
It has also been his duty to arrange the matter for publication, and 
to supervise its passage through the press. To these editorial

vu 



duties lie has confined himself, taking no part as a contributor ; and 
he may, therefore, without impropriety express the belief that 
the volume will be found to possess interest for all classes of 
readers, and to have much value as a repository of an important 
part of the sanitary experience of the war.

SECTION FIRST 



CONTRIBUTIONS 



RELATING TO THE 



CAUSATION AND PREVENTION OF DISEASE. 



The contributions selected for Section First of this volume relate to topics belonging to 
General Pathology. These topics, for the most part, are etiological, having reference 
especially to the diverse causes incident to the camp and the field, tending to impair physical 
endurance, and diminish the power of resisting disease; and these causes are considered 
with special reference to their practical bearing on Prophylaxis, or the prevention of disease. 
Causes and preventive means are considered in this section, with some exceptions, in rela- 
tion to disease in general; individual diseases are considered with reference to their causa- 
tion and prevention, as well as under other aspects, in Section Second, which is devoted to 
Special Pathology. The relatively greater importance of the topics embraced in Section 
First entitles it to precedence in the order of arrangement. The several chapters of this 
section, embodying, as they do, the experience of distinguished members of the medical 
profession who served as medical ofHcers during the war of the rebellion, will commend 
themselvi-s to the attention of the reader, in view of the importance of the topics as regards 
the preservation of the life and health of the soldier, and thereby the efficiency of armies 
in active service. 



SANITARY MEMOIRS OF THE WAR. 



CHAPTER FIRST. 

THE VARIOUS INFLUENCES AFFECTING THE PHYSICAL ENDURANCE, 
THE POWER OF RESISTING DISEASE. ETC., OF THE MEN COMPOSING 
THE VOLUNTEER ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES. 

By ROBERTS BARTHOLOW, A.M., M.D., 

PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AND MKDICAL CHEMISTRY IN THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF OHIO, 
ETC.; FORMERLY ASSISTANT- SURGEON U. S. ARMY. 

Influences previous to Enlistment. — Qualifications for Military Service, relating to Race, 
Temperament, Occupation, Age, etc. — Causes affecting Physical Stamina subsequent to 
Enlistment, relating to Exposure, Diet, Overcrowding, and the Lack of Cleanliness. — 
The Mental and floral Effects of Association. — Liability to specific Febrile Affections. — 
Causes affecting the Physical Stamina in Active-Service, Climatic, Dietetic, Accidental, 
Specific, Moral, and Compound. — Moral Causes affecting the Physical Stamina of the 
Soldier, relating to Cowardice, Weakness of Will, and Nostalgia. — Malingering, its 
Causes and Degree of Prevalence. — The Forms of Disability feigned, namely: Affections 
of the Cerebro-Spinal System, of the Thoracic Organs, of the Digestive System, of the 
Genito-Urhiary Apparatus, of the Extremities, and Constitutional or General Aflections. 
— Detection and Treatment of the various Forms of feigned Disability. — Discharges on 
Surgeon's Certificate. 

The various influences affecting the physical endurance of the 
men composing our volunteer armies, their power of resistance to 
disease, etc., may be comprehended in four groups, namely : — 

1. The influences in operation previous to enlistment ; 

2. The causes affecting the physical stamina of the recruit sub- 
sequent to enlistment ; 

3. The causes affecting the physical stamina of the soldier in 
active service ; and, 

4. Moral causes, as malingering, desertion, nostalgia, etc., in 
operation during the whole period. 

I. 

Under the first head must be included an outline of the quali- 
fications of a recruit for the military service : race, tem- Quaiifica- 

, . , "^ . , . „ tionsformU- 

perament, occupation, age, height, weight, capacity of itary service. 
thorax, muscular development, and a proper performance of the 
functions of animal and organic life. 



4 QUALITIES OF THE CELTIC RACES. 

The races composing our volunteer army consisted, cliiefly, of 
Kaces com- American, Celtic, Teutonic, Negro, and the mixed Span- 
voiinier ish-American of New Mexico. The term American 
*^'^- applies, of course, to the composite race now inhabiting 

the continent, and not to the aborigines. It will be useful to con- 
trast, in no invidious spirit, the aptitude for military service and the 
power of endurance respectively displayed by these several races. 
As regards these quahties, they stand to each other in the relation 
in which they are placed above — the American first and the 
Spanish-American last. 

The mental characteristics that fit the American for the military 
American scrvicc cousist of a Spirit of enterprise and an intel- 
acteristics. lectual liardiliood which render him superior to fatigue ; 
an easy bearing under defeat, and a buoyant self-confidence which 
misfortunes do not easily depress. The national vanity and love 
of popularity may have much to do in the formation and develop- 
ment of these mihtary qualities. So acute an observer as Dr. 
Jackson ^ formed a very different opinion of the American char- 
acter. " The people of North America are deficient in two qual- 
ities that are essential to the formation of military force, namely, 
the subordination which submits patiently to such forms of mould- 
ing and discipline as render the human race a machine, obedient to 
the will of a general to whatever point it may be applied ; or, 
secondly, the ardent love of country, which, rising to enthusiasm, 
produces acts of individual heroism beyond the calculations of tac- 
ticians and superior to the arts of mere mechanism." Events 
have not justified the harsh criticism of Dr. Jackson. 

The physical qualities which fit the American for military ser- 
American vicc consist, uot SO mucli in muscular development and 
quauties. height as in the toughness of his muscular fibre and the 
fi'eedom of his tissue from interstitial fat, whereby active and pro- 
longed movements are much facilitated. In active service he fails 
more fi-equently from defects in his digestive apparatus and fi'om a 
phthisical tendency, than fi:"om a lack of power due to imperfect 
physical development. 

The Celtic races possess similar qualities, and in respect of 
Qualities of merely physical development are not unequal to the 

tnc Celtic k • 1 t t t • rh 

races. AmcHcau, but they have less tenacity of purpose and 

mental hardihood. As mercenary soldiers they did not exhibit the 
same zeal, energy, and power of endurance. They submitted with 
less patience than the Americans to the requirements of discipline,

THE MIXED RACE OF NEW MEXICO. 5 

were frequently turbulent under hardships and given to complaints 
about the rations and fatigue duties. Irish laborers were especially 
notorious for their dishke to fatigue duties. . 

The German element of the volunteer army did not equal the 
American or Celtic in the physical capacity for military German eie- 
service. There are certam detects ot structure, common army. 
in a greater or less extent to all Germans, which impair their pow- 
ers of endurance — a predominance of the lymphatic temperament ; 
a patulence or unusual weakness of the abdominal rings ; flatness 
of the feet, and a tendency to a varicose condition of the veins of 
the inferior extremities. 

The German carries into the mihtary service many of the men- 
tal and moral qualities for which he is most conspicuous in civil 
life, namely, thrift, fondness for good living, and a love of ease and 
enjoyment. The first inclines him to serve for hire and to make 
the most of his opportunities for emolument ; the second produces 
discontent, and even unfits him for service when the rations are 
deficient ; and the third renders him restive under hardships and 
exposure. 

The Negro possesses many of the physical qualities pertaining to 
the hio;hest type of the soldier : sufficient heip-ht, a due The physical

rax, and considerable power of endurance. His chief physical 
defects are small, ill-developed calves and bad feet, and a proneness 
to disease especially of the pulmonary organs. Having the faculty 
of imitation highly developed and being fond of the exterior show 
and parade of military life, he readily becomes an adept in the 
mechanical training of the soldier. The Negro soldier is, unques- 
tionably, less enduring than the white soldier ; less active, vigilant, 
and enterprising, and more given to malingering. The Mulatto is 
feebler than the Negro, invariably scrofulous, and more fi'equently 
the subject of pulmonary disease. 

The mixed race of New Mexico is inferior to the Negro. Of

fitted for service. The chief defects were, feebleness of constitu- 
tion, the syphilitic cachexia, impaired vision, defoi-mities of the 
hands and feet, and diseases of the urinary organs. They are 
cowardly, unrehable, and difficult to control, in consequence of a 
very mercurial temperament. 

It is not easy to determine how far those special physical char- 
acteristics, denominated temperaments, influence the will, the moral

Influence of the light-haired, blue-eyed — the sanguine, are more sus- 
m^^ts^'^ ceptible to the influence of malaria, to diseases of the 
spleen, and to albuminoid degeneration of organs ; the dark tem- 
peraments to diseases of the hver, to dysentery, and to pneumonia. 
The influence of temperament over the moral quahties will be 
considered more properly in the fourth group. 

The influence of occupation upon the physical health is obvious 
Influence of euough. Tliosc wlio pui'suc scdcutary trades, who hve 
occupation, jj^^cli iu-doors, or who are exposed in the course of their 
business and pursuits to crowd-poisoning, or to vitiated air from any 
cause, are by no means so well fitted for military service as those 
whose employments require them to spend much time in the open 
air, especially in the open air of the country. Hence farmers, 
lumbermen, and railroad men are better prepared to endure the 
hardships of a soldier's life than clerks, weavers, shoemakers, etc.

son has acquired somewhat more control over the appetites and 
passions. The Enrollment Act fixed the minimum age at 20 years, 
and the maximum at 45 years. This wise regulation was frequently 
disregarded, except in the case of drafted men. It w^as not un- 
common to find youths of 15 years and old men of 60 years in the 
ranks, but more frequently in the hospitals. In the English ser- 
vice the minimum age is 18 ; in the French and Prussian 20, and in 
the Austrian 19. As a majority of the most military nations have 
so decided after considerable experience, the age of 20 years must 
be regarded as the earliest suitable age for the miHtary service. 

The medium height, a weight of 160 pounds, 33 inches in the 
Other condi- girth of the clicst, and an expansive mobility of 3 inches, 
favorable to cceteHs paHhus^ present the conditions as to physical health 
vice. most favorable to military service. Symmetry is by no 

means so important as swelling muscles, well-marked bony promi- 
nences and well-developed joints — for these are the evidences of 
power and endurance. Great height is fi:equently objectionable, 
because gained at the expense of the development of the thorax. 
The rule is, that the girth of the chest at the level of the nipple 
should equal half the height, but in tall men this rule may be vio- 
lated. Excessive weight or obesity is still more decidedly disqual- 
ifying than excessive height. 



CAUSES IN PREVIOUS LIFE AFFECTING STAMINA. 7 

Perfection of the senses is essential. The organs of special 
sense should not only be free from disease, but they should have 
that ready appreciation of their appropriate stimuli, which is a 
proof of the healthy activity of the central nervous system. The 
functions of all the organs should be so well performed that the 
happy balance between waste and supply should be maintained. 

Besides these physical requirements, there are certain mental 
states favorable, and certain others unfiivorable, to the proper per- 
formance of military service. The soldier should possess a cheerful 
disposition, a calm temper, and that indifference to danger and 
fatigue which is more frequently the result of mental forces than 
physical strength. 

^e assume that the recruit submitted to the usual inspection 
conforms to the standard as set forth in the preceding causes in 
paragraphs. The question then occurs, What causes affecting ^^*^ 
arising in his previous life and experiences may affect his **^°"°*- 
physical stamina, independently of the new conditions to wdiich he 
is subjected immediately on enlistment ? These causes may 
include certain hereditary diseases, as insanity, epilepsy, scrofula, 
and tuberculosis ; and such acquired cachexise as the chronic mal- 
arial poisoning, masturbation, chronic alcoholismus, and incipient 
disease of important organs. Although not recognizable on ordi- 
nary examination, these conditions may yet exist in sufficient 
degree to be readily excited by ordinary causes into well-defined 
morbid processes. 

The operation of these occult causes of disease in recruits ante- 
cedent to enlistment is shown in the following statistics : In 15,500 
discharges on surgeon's certificate, as examined by me at the War 
Department, there were 154 for mental infirmities, 341 for epi- 
lepsy, 411 for various cachexias, 44 for bad moral character, and 
3593 for diseases of the chest. A large majority of these were 
either hereditary, or existed in modified form at the time of enlist- 
ment. 

Many of the causes affecting the physical stamina of the recruit 
previous to enlistment might have been recognized by proper care 
and diligence in the examination. The neglect to examine men in 
the beginning of the war, and the lack of thoroughness in the 
examinations afterward, increased the number of men serving, 
but diminished the relative efiiciency. The statistics bearing on 
this point are quite conclusive. Thus, in 15,500 discharges, there 
were 388 for disqualifications due to age, and 209 for natural 
feebleness of constitution, both of which are recognized without 
difficulty. 



8 LIFE AT THE DEPOT OF RECRUITS. 

II. 

The recruit makes a sudden transition from a natural to an arti- 
sudden ficial state without any preparation for the change. It 
the recruit may bc achuittcd as true, at least of a large majority of 
ciai state. the pcoplc of tliis couutry, that the recruit has had suffi- 
cient food, and in proper variety ; that he has been suitably 
clothed ; that he has had undisturbed sleep as many hours as his 
health required; that he has had the necessary air-space in his 
daily avocations and during his sleep at night; and that he has 
been able to avoid the more trying vicissitudes of the weather. 
Those who have not enjoyed similar comforts are, it may be safely 
affirmed, usually unfitted for military service. 

As soon after enlistment as possible, the recruit is hurried to the 
Life at the dcpot ; he is supplied with army rations badly cooked and 
recruits. uncleauly served ; he is drilled vigorously several hours 
each day ; at night, furnished with one or two blankets and occa- 
sionally a little straw, he is thrust into a tent with a large number 
of others, or into crowded temporary quarters, where he is sub- 
jected to horribly impure air, frequently to cold and dampness, and 
always to excessive discomfort, or he is required to perform a tour 
of guard duty which interrupts his habit of nightly repose ; but 
slender opportunities of washing and bathing are afforded him, and 
he is at all times exposed to the influence of the unwholesome air 
of badly-policed camps and quarters, and to the emanations fi'om 
his comrades sufferino; under various contagious maladies. 

Scarcely any depot of reciniits was an exception to this descrip- 
tion during the rebellion. Some of these evils of necessity grew 
out of the military service, and could not be eliminated from it ; 
but many more were entirely preventable. To a military man, a 
recruit is a piece of mechanism, to be adapted to the needs of the 
military service ; and the shortest method to accomplish this object 
is the best. Hence, a kneading and compressing process is fol- 
lowed. With the few recruits for the regular military establish- 
ment, this process may be pursued with less extensive injury ; but 
mental, moral, and physical consequences ensue to the volunteers, 
which limit their efficiency in service, and often prove fatal to them 
at the outset. It will be useftil to consider, in the first place, the 
physical consequences which ensued by reason of the improper 
hygienic management of recruits ; for the mental and moral conse- 
quences largely depended on the physical. 

The several drafts of men after the three months' service were

mainly in the fall, winter, and spring. The buildings Exposure in

wholly inadequate, and hence, the recruits, as a rule, were placed 
in tents. Suitable provision, in these places, could not be made 
against vicissitudes of weather and dampness. Drainage, ventila- 
tion, and police of camps and quarters, were usually neglected. 
Guard duty at night, and exhausting drills, lessened the vital 
forces. Heated and fatigued by drill, the recruit was too much 
accustomed to throw himself upon the damp straw or blankets. 
Catarrhal and pulmonary affections were produced, the more 
promptly in the case of those recruits — a large number — who 
were not at all habituated to such experiences. 

Dietetic causes were scarcely less important agencies in the 
production of disease than climatic. Large numbers of Dietetic

little provision was made, or, indeed, could be made, for the suit- 
able preparation of food. The recruits themselves were wholly 
ignorant of the culinary art; there was neither time nor oppor- 
tunity to instruct them ; cooks were not provided, and the utensils 
issued were most inadequate for the purpose. Moreover, the 
components of the ration were not adapted to the peculiar circum- 
stances ; they were sufficiently various and in sufficient quantity, 
but were not in a form available to recruits unaccustomed to the 
preparation of food. Hence, in the midst of abundance, sufferhig 
from hunger was not uncommon. The effort to have the cooking 
done by companies was hardly accomplished, even with troops in 
the field, by the end of the war ; and this system was not practi- 
cable with recruits who had no company organization, or, if 
organized into temporary companies, had no homogeneity nor 
completeness of detail in respect to company management. It 
usually happened that a squad of three or four organized them- 
selves into a mess, each contributing his rations to the common 
stock, and alternating in the duties of cooking. The results were 
not satisfactory. An American intrusted with cooking for the 
first time, thinks only of frying. Flour made into a paste with 
water was usually fried in the fat of the bacon, or made into 
loaves with baking powder, if the cook possessed so much skill or 
experience. Beef was invariably fried, and the beans and rice 
frequently also. Being unprovided with suitable receptacles for 
their stores, and unskilled in defining their daily quantitative 
allowances, they were frequently without food for a day or two 



10 DIETETIC CAUSES OF DISEASE. 

preceding the time for issue. Improvements were made, especially 
by constructing ovens and issuing baker's bread in lieu of flour, 
but the cooking by messes continued the rule throughout the war. 

Eating badly-cooked food hastily, and without relish, resulted in 
indigestion, flatulence, and diarrhoea. Beans probably contributed, 
more than any single article, to the production of these intestinal 
troubles. They were almost always insufficiently cooked by 
recruits, to whom indeed they were not familiar as an article of 
human food, if we except the troops from New York and the New 
England States. It has frequently happened to me to observe an 
increase in the percentage of diarrhoea and dysentery on the day 
after the issue of bean soup. In a body of four hundred recruits, 
every man came on to the "sick report" with one of these disorders 
in the space of three months, and one fifth came more than once. 
Beans have been continued in the supplies of the commissariat 
upon a theory of their nutritive value, based upon a proximate 
analysis ; on account of their portability, and because they do not 
readily undergo change. Whatever may be their value in these 
respects, there can be no doubt that they are hurtftil to recruits, 
who do not have the necessary skill in preparing them, and who, 
by various causes, are rendered peculiarly susceptible to their 
UTitant action upon the intestinal mucous surface. 

The Napoleonic maxim — the soup makes the soldier — was not 
sufficiently attended to at our recruiting depots, l^ean soup re- 
quires more artistic skill in its preparation than other plain soups, 
but was more frequently made. The distribution of the rations to 
individuals prevented the preparation of food on a large scale. 
The waste of this system rendered it more expensive to the gov- 
ernment than ample provision for cooking would have been. 
Moreover, the destruction in health and life was hardly to be 
estimated in the pecuniary sense. If this view had governed the 
authorities, so great was the cost of a soldier that money would 
have been well expended which insured his preservation in health 
and efficiency. 

These dietetic causes influencing the health of recruits would 
not be complete without some reference to the irregular sources of 
supply, available in the sutlers' shops and booths permitted in the 
camps. The chief profits of the sutler were derived from the sale 
of fruits and " fancy groceries " — to use a commercial phrase — 
which the recruit too eagerly purchased to enrich his meagre diet, 
or supply the loss of misused rations. 

Overcrowding of tents and quarters was a fruitfril source of 




MORAL EFFECTS OF ASSOCIATION. 11 

mischief. This was especially observable at night and during 
bad weather. The air of those places became quickly overcrowd- 
foul — loaded with organic emanations and with carbonic Ln^d*l[uar'i*^ 
acid, and deprived of much of its oxygen. On entering **^^' 
the ten\s or quarters under these circumstances, there was imme- 
diately to be perceived a strong " animal odor," the more diffuse 
and powerful when the personal cleanhness of the men had been 
neglected. Headache, nervousness and tremors, a coated tongue 
and nausea, were frequently experienced by recruits subjected for 
a single day or night to the influence of such an atmosphere. 
Moreover, the increased action of the capillaries of the integu- 
ment, the relaxation of the bronchial mucous membrane, and the 
diminished urinary secretion occurring under these circumstances, 
greatly favored the reception of morbific agents, and disposed to 
attacks of catarrh, bronchitis, and pneumonia, from slight causes. 
Tliere can be no question that organic matter in a state of minute 
subdivision, derived from a number of persons crowded into a con- 
fined space, possesses considerable morbific power, especially in the 
production of intestinal diseases; for, absorbed into the blood, 
these particles are excreted mainly through the mucous surface of 
the alimentary canal. 

A lack of personal cleanliness was little less promotive of disease 
than the causes already enumerated. The water supply, ^a^^ ^f 
at the inland depots especially, was never equal to the <'^^'^°^i°«s3- 
requirements ; hence, if the recruit possessed the inclination, he 
had little opportunity to keep his person clean. Example arid 
instruction were wanting as well as opportunity. Every thing 
about him being dirty and disagreeable, the necessity for cleanli- 
ness was by no means apparent. It was painful to see at all 
the depots the slovenly, slipshod appearance of the clothing and 
accoutrements of the recruits, their filthy skins, uncombed hair, 
and matted beards. 

The association of men in masses or herds, rapidly produces 
mental and moral degeneracy. In their fives being assimi- Moral effects 
lated to that of animals, their minds conform to the same tion. 
standard. This brings us to consider the influence of these condi- 
tions and experiences upon the mental and moral qualities of the 
recruit. The great change in his habits and modes of life, asso- 
ciated with so much that was disagreeable and repulsive, induced 
in the recruit, if not possessed of considerable fortitude and per- 
sonal resources, a state of deep dejection, hypochondria, and 
nostalgia. This was especially to be observed in young men and 



12 LIABILITY TO SPECIFIC FEBRILE DISEASES. 

married men of mature age. If there existed any hereditary 
tendency to insanity, this state of despondency, hypochondria, or 
nostalgia, powerfully contributed to its development ; hence, mental 
disorders arising during the war occurred more frequently in re- 
cruits than in soldiers of more than a year's service. 

The mental impressions of these first experiences of the military 
service, if not sufficient to induce insanity, lead directly to various 
mental and moral disorders. Malingering was suggested as a 
ready expedient for avoiding fiirther service ; desertion was con- 
sidered if not attempted. The monotony of the life and the 
unaccustomed restraint, together with the hardships to which they 
were exposed, disposed recruits, when occasion offered, to run into 
excesses of drinking and venery. They became intoxicated and 
indulged in venereal excesses who were not accustomed to do so 
before enlistment: the forces repressed by military training thus 
broke bounds and ran riot. 

The recruit is thus exposed to ordinary and extraordinary causes

experiences : diseases of the respiratory organs ; eruptive diseases ;

typhoid fever may be developed, or if the depot be placed in a 
malarious district, malarious diseases may occur. The considera- 
tion of these may be excluded, because not characteristic of the 
special conditions under which the recruit is placed. 

Catarrh, bronchitis, pneumonia, measles, mumps, diarrhoea, and 
dysentery, were the diseases which chiefly affected recruits at the 
depots during the war. It is easy to conceive that exposure to 
cold, to humidity, to sudden and extreme changes of temperature, 
— ordinary causes in the experience of recruits, — should produce 
catarrh, bronchitis, and pneumonia, or should favor the propaga- 
tion of influenza, diphtheria, and the exanthemata. These forms 
of disease occur under similar conditions in civil life. Recruits 
were more subject to them than the same number of civilians of 
corresponding ages, because they were placed in circumstances 
more fully exposing them to the action of morbific agents. 

The point of chief practical interest in this connection is. What 
Liability to agency had the new life and experiences of the recruit in 
di,^eases. produciug or favoring the spread of the specific febrile 
affections (mumps, measles, influenza, etc.) ? A variety of opinions 
have prevailed on this point. We may find a solution of the prob- 



CAMP MEASLES. 13 

lem in the clinical history of measles, — the most wide-spread and 
fatal of these diseases, — for, since they all present strong analogies 
in their history, the study of one will serve to elucidate the rest. 

A popular and, to a certain extent, professional opinion existed 
during the war, which referred camp measles to a specific c^mp 
cause arising in the special conditions in which the recruit ™®*«^e«- 
was placed. .One observer (Dr. Salisbury^) proceeded so far, 
indeed, as to fix upon a variety of the penicillium, which he found 
upon damp straw used for bedding, as the cause. His views were 
accepted, probably without sufficient examination, by so distin- 
guished an author and observer as Dr. Hammond.^ On the other 
hand, they were wholly denied by Dr. Woodward.^ It was gen- 
erally believed that camp measles differed from ordinary measles 
in occurring several times in the same individual. 

Some interesting statistics have been collected in elucidation of 
these questions. 

Eight hundred cases were treated in two hospitals under my 
direction in a period of four months — January to April, 1864. 
The average mortality was 22 per 100. Of 100 cases set apart 
for special examination, 96 were recruits, and 28 of these were 
18 years of age, and 68 from the ages of 17 to 20, inclusive. In 
one regiment, which came specially under my observation, every 
man contracted measles who had not had it in early life. This 
was the rule in all regiments exposed to the poison. This state- 
ment is supported by the fact, that in 100 cases 91 had not suf- 
fered at any period in life firom measles, and only 9 supposed they 
had had this disease, but were not at all certain. 

These facts in the clinical history of measles would seem to indi- 
cate that this disease was propagated by contagion, and that it 
occurred amongst young recruits because they had not hitherto 
been exposed to the specific poison, and that the epidemics were 
more severe amongst these subjects because they were placed in 
the most favorable condition for the development of the morbific 
matter. The skin, bronchial mucous membrane, and intestinal 
tract, whose several surfaces may be considered as organs perform- 
ing offices in some respects vicarious of each other, were deranged 
in their normal relations, and rendered exceedingly susceptible to 
the action of poisons or common causes of disease. 

It is thus evident how a large class of diseases arising from 
specific and ordinary causes were favored in their development by

conditions and experiences affecting the recruit. These con(Htions 
and experiences produced a morbid state, in which a feeble, con- 
tagious influence only was necessary to give rise to formidable 
epidemics of influenza, mumps, and eruptive fevers. 

The operation of the dietetic causes already discussed, are appar- 
ent enough. Improper alimentation acted the more promptly in 
the production of intestinal disorders by reason of the derange- 
ment in the vicarious oflice of integument and mucous membrane 
alluded to in the last paragraph. It may be safely assumed as a 
fact, that few recruits passed through the first experiences of the 
mihtary service without suffering from diarrhoea or dysentery^ 
This is shown to be the case by the statistics of the first year of 
the war. Thus, in the armies of the interior region the proportion 
of these diseases was 994.77 per 1000 of mean strength. 

III. 

The influence of the various conditions and experiences affect- 
Causes affect- iug the recruit were not always manifested in the forms 
Btfminrin* dcscribed in the preceding section. It was to be observed 
Tice. " at every recruiting depot that many recruits fell out of 
condition who were not affected with a well-defined morbid process 
to which a specific nomenclature could be applied. Many of them 
suffered lesions, eventuating in permanent organic changes, which 
appeared after entering upon active service. Diseases of the lungs 
and kidneys, diarrhoea and dysentery, may be classed in this cate- 
gory. 

The mortality, or the various degrees of disability, arising from 
camp measles, are not to be represented in the tables of immediate 
loss. Many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery, which 
subsequently proved fatal or required discharge from the service, 
originated in camp measles at recruiting depots. Mumps is to be 
regarded from the same point of view. Whatever ill effects occur 
beyond the immediate sickness, are not developed at the time, but 
the seed is sown which ripens into a plentiftil harvest. Various 
glandular affections and diseases of the testes, especially varicocele, 
may be traced back to an attack of mumps. 

In this section, those causes of disease which result fi'om actual 
service are to be discussed. They may be conveniently considered 
under the following heads, namely : — 

Climatic; Accidental; Dietetic; 

Specific ; Moral ; Compound.

of recruit, unliarmed by the causes of disease to which he was then 
subjected. 

The climatic causes affecting the physical endurance of the sol- 
dier, were the first to which he was exposed during the climatic 
rebellion. A vast majority of those who entered the ^"^"^e^- 
military service were to a great degree unaccustomed to changes 
of climate. Men, indeed, possess an inherent indisposition to un- 
dergo these changes. This fact finds an expression in the well- 
known law of emigration, that movements of populations take 
place along the isothermal lines to which they are accustomed. 
This law is probably founded in a necessity of the human constitu- 
tion, which requires for its highest development uniformity in the 
conditions surrounding it. An opinion has widely prevailed that 
our troops during the late rebellion experienced no ill effects from 
the changes of climate. This opinion has no foundation in fact. 
But whatever ill effects were experienced from this cause were not 
sufficient in extent to have occasioned very decisive results. Still, 
this influence of climate is rendered apparent enough by contrast- 
ing the mortality rates of troops operating in widely separated par- 
allels of latitude. Thus whilst the average annual mortality of 
the United States army during eighteen years of peace service was 
24 per 1000 of mean strength, durmg the Mexican war it rose to 
103.8 per 1000. Contrast the mortality of the Mexican war with 
that of the first year of the rebellion — 103.8 : 67.6. The differ- 
ence, amounting to 36.2 per 1000, was largely due to the influence 
of change of climate. This influence was also exhibited in the mor- 
tality rates of the armies operating in different sections of the coun- 
try. Whilst the mortality of the army of the Potomac and the 
troops on the Atlantic coast was 33.40 per 1000 of mean strength, 
that of the armies operating in the interior — on the Mississippi 
and its tributaries — was 82.19 per 1000. In estimating these re- 
sults it must be understood that the influence of climate was only 
one of numerous elements to be considered ; but it was, neverthe- 
less, a substantive element. 

The mortality rates and the percentage of sickness as influenced 
by season, illustrate the mode in which chmate affects the influence of 
physical endurance of men in active service. Whilst the s*"'^'*"^- 
maximum mortality of the armies of the interior region was attained 
in January, February, and March, the period of greatest sickness 
was in the months of August, September, and October. On the 
other hand, April, May, and June were the months of greatest 
mortality, and July and August of greatest sickness in the armies 
on the Atlantic coast. 



16 DIETETIC CAUSES. 

The particular forms in which these cHmatic causes expressed 
themselves were catarrh, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and dys- 
entery. 

The dietetic causes affecting the physical endurance of men in 
Dietetic activc scrvice were similar in character to those of re- 
causes. cruits. So loug as the supplies of the commissariat were 

regularly furnished, the effects were the same ; but they were more 
evident in the former, because the cause was longer in action. In 
addition to this circumstance, soldiers in the field experienced 
various vicissitudes in the character and quality of their supphes. 
The amount of aliment furnished to the various armies was deter- 
mined by the transportation available for bringing it forward, and 
by the so-called " miHtary necessity." The armies operating in 
the interior region were more affected by deficiencies in commissa- 
riat supplies than those on the Atlantic coast. Thus, the army 
under General Buell was for many days subsisted on com chiefly, 
and such precarious supplies as could be procured from an impov- 
erished country. General Grant's army, in the campaign before 
the investment of Vicksburg, was reduced to similar dietetic expe- 
dients. The army encamped at Chattanooga, pre^dous and for 
some time subsequent to the battles of Mission Ridge and Lookout 
Mountain, was restricted to httle more than one fourth rations in 
consequence of deficient transportation. Irregularity and defi- 
ciency of supplies were, then, important dietetic causes, but they 
can hardly be considered the chief causes. For men exposed as 
our soldiers were to various morbific agencies, the diet was not 
sufficiently varied. Hard bread, pork, beans, and coffee, which 
were practically the elements of the diet, did not fulfill all the ne- 
cessary conditions. Antiscorbutics came to be furnished afi:er the 
first year of the war, but the chief antiscorbutic — the potato — 
was practically unavailable from the difficulty of transporting and 
preserving it. Cabbage, pickled, was also supplied ; but however 
valuable as an antiscorbutic, it was indigestible and provocative 
of intestinal disorders. 

Inexpert preparation of food, cooking by messes instead of com- 
panies, and the use of baking powders, may be classed as dietetic 
causes. The latter was by no means unimportant. Whenever 
flour was issued, and sutlers' supplies could be obtained, the men 
were accustomed to prepare bread with baking powder — a vile 
compound of flour and soda remarkable for hardness and indigesti- 
bihty. 

The unripe fruits obtained in the regions where the various com- 
mands operated also acted as a dietetic cause of disease. 




CROWD-POISONING. 17 

« 

In considering the accidental causes^ we necessarily exclude trau- 
matic lesions as not coming within the scope of this chap- Accidental 
ter. Various influences are to be discussed under this *^^"''®^- 
head, namely : all those conditions comprehended in the term, had 
hygiene ; exhausting marches, fatigue, scorbutus, etc. 

Troops on the march, cceteris paribus, are more favorably situ- 
ated as respects hygienic conditions than troops in camp, ^t^^ ^^^.^^^ 
Fatigue and limited subsistence stores are frequently less ^inhanThe 
injurious than the various influences of the camp. The '^^^^ 
injurious effects in camp are exhibited in proportion to the disci- 
pline of the troops. There is a direct ratio, usually, between the 
sickness and mortality of the camp and the degree of attention to 
police and sanitary regulations. The morbific influences of the 
camp, excluding malaria and scorbutus, are such as arise from de- 
ficient drainage, bad police, contaminated water-supply, and crowd- 
poisoning. 

Dampness of the soil and humidity of the air affect the respira- 
tory organs and the alimentary canal, producing catarrh. Dampness of 
pneumonia, diarrhoea, and dysentery. The accumulation it'^y/iLTim- 
of the debris of camps, of offal and of sinks, produced P^'^e^^'e^'- 
that condition of the atmosphere in which fevers of the continued 
type occuri'ed. The neglect to dig sinks, or to preserve in a proper 
condition those already constructed, proved injurious in numberless 
instances. The air of the camps was polluted not only by this 
cause but by the decomposing offal from the kitchens, which, thrown 
on to the ground, underwent decay with other vegetable organic 
matters in the soil. The water-supply was frequently contami- 
nated in the same manner. When large bodies of troops were 
encamped on small streams the water quickly became infected, if 
not by the direct addition of camp filth and the contents of the 
sinks, indirectly through the surface ch'ainage. The character of 
the water itself constituted in some instances a source of disease. 
Streams flowing through alluvial bottoms became saturated with 
organic matter of vegetable origin. The large percentage of lime 
which the water of many parts of the interior region contained, 
rendered it unsuitable for drinking purposes. The accidental im- 
purities were more important in respect to the causation of disease, 
than the natural constituents of the potable waters. 

The effects of crowd-poisoning were chiefly exhibited in the win- 
ter camps. After the first year of the war the camp and c^owd- 
garrison equipage issued to the troops was never adequate po^^^^i^s- 
to the necessities of the case. Huts were accordingly chiefly used. 



18 SPECIFIC CAUSES OF DISEASE. 

These were constructed of such materials as were available at the 
point selected for the camp. In many instances they were small 
huts or caves built of mud and covered with a portion of shelter 
tent large enough to permit three to live in them, giving each not 
more than fifty cubic feet of air-space, and frequently not more 
than twenty. Air was excluded as much as possible to permit the 
fire on the rude fire-place to warm the interior. Into these the 
men crowded during unpleasant weather and at night. The foetid 
odor and suffocating vapors which were produced in these places 
appalled one not accustomed to them, and were injurious to all 
subjected to their influence. This deteriorated atmosphere affected 
the blood and was powerfully causative of fevers. 

This description is not fanciful nor exaggerated. I draw the 
facts of the description from the winter camp of the army of the 
Cumberland at Chattanooga, where the soldiers were situated as 
favorably as any other troops as respects hygienic conditions.

doubtedly existed to a large extent. It exhibited itself in various 
forms, but especially in increasing the fatality of diseases, and in 
impressing an adynamic character on those of mild and tractable 
form. As a distinct, substantive affection, it existed to the extent 
of 1338 in the first year, and 7395 in the second year of the 
war.

Specific form a large and influential class. Chief amongst these

malarial element existed as a complication in a large number of 
diseases. It has been elsewhere shown the important role which 
this poison performed in army diseases.

• 
The long-continued action of malaria, without inducing fever, 

is to be separated from the characteristic febrile move- ^aiariai 

ments resulting from the rapid imbibition of this poison, p^so'iins- 

The general prevalence of malarial poisoning is exhibited in the 
fact that 262,807 cases of malarial fevers were admitted on the 
sick report during the years 1862-63. There are no data for esti- 
matino- the degree in which the malarial element existed as a com- 
plication in other forms of disease. Taking those for a standard in 
which more or less malarial complication existed, — camp fever, 
dysentery, — we may obtain an insight into the great importance 
of this element without being able to express the influence numer- 
ically. Thus during the first two years of the war, 213,260 cases 
of the various forms of camp fever — typhoid, typho-malarial, and 
remittent — occurred. Again, the same influence is expressed in 
the number of cases of diarrhoea and dysentery, which for the first 
two years of the war reached the enormous number of 725,675 
cases. The influence of season upon the degree of prevalence of 
these disorders tends to show rather more specifically the operation 
of a malarial element in their causation ; July, August, September, 
and October were the months of greatest prevalence of diarrhoea 
and dysentery. 

Although the relation of malaria to various forms of army dis- 
eases cannot be expressed numerically, there are data for determin- 
ing the relation in many cases. The influence of chronic malarial 
poisoning results in a series of well-defined anatomical changes 
which may be traced in the lesions with which they are associated. 
Tliis is well seen in army diarrhoea. The changes induced by ma- 
laria in the glandular apparatus of the intestinal canal are closely 
connected with, if they do no> precede, those belonging essentially 
to this disease. Again, thii ^-elation is exhibited in the morbid 
anatomy of the so-called typho-malarial fever — where the malarial 
element expresses itself in well-marked pathological changes which 
may be separated from those due exclusively to the typhoid disease. 

The camp fever of the army was, essentially, typhoid ; it was 
modified by various accidental and specific causes. We Camp, or 
have just alluded to one of the specific modifying causes fever. 
— malaria ; the most important of the others was scorbutus. Ty- 
phoid fever prevailed under the same conditions in our armies as in 
our civil populations. Overcrowding, animal and vegetable decom- 
position, impure water, etc., were the conditions -chiefly concerned 
in the army. Hence it was a disease of the winter camps rather 
than of smnmer campaigns. It was a specific disease arising from

as an accidental constituent without being at all causative. 

Measles, mumps, erysipelas, small-pox, diphtheria, etc., belong to 
Measles ^^^^^ Order. Of these, 78,809 occurred in the first two

Under the term compound cause it is intended to express that 
Compound compositc morbid state produced by climatic, dietetic, ac- 
dLsease. cidcutal, and some of the specific causes. In a study of 
the etiology, symptomatology, and even the morbid anatomy of 
army diseases, it was not possible in every case to separate one 
class of actions or causes from another. In this compound morbid 
state, scorbutus, or the scorbutic taint, so called, and malaria, played 
the most important parts. To the lowered vitality of the blood 
and softened solids of scorbutus were added the visceral and other 
changes due to malaria. A special cachexia was thereby devel- 
oped, which not only favored the action of common causes of dis- 
ease, but greatly influenced the mortality from all causes. Its 
influence was largely seen in the results of surgery in the war. 
The power of resistance to wounds and injuries was diminished in 
consequence of the lowered vitality induced by this cachexia. It 
prevented the reparative process, converting simple injuries into 
fatal ones ; it produced secondary hemorrhage, sloughing of tissues 
(pseudo-hospital gangrene), and septicaemia, and promoted the 
spread of hospital gangrene, pyaemia, and erysipelas. 

The diseases and surgery of the war must be studied in the light 
of the conditions induced by this compound morbid state. Any 
statistics or deductions of experience must be valueless which do 
not express the influence of this state. 

IV. 

The moral causes afiecting the physical stamina of the soldier 
include cowardice, weakness of will, nostalgia, and malingermg. 




iq^OSTALGIA. 21 

Tlie first two cannot be expressed numerically. There are no 
data for estimating their precise importance. Cowardice Moral causes 
usually finds an expression in malingering, weakness of pJ^S 
will, and nostalgia, but the immediate relation is not fre- ^''*"""'»- 
quently demonstrable. 

In the first two years of the war, there were reported 2588 
cases of nostalma, and 13 deaths from this cause. These 

-I -1 p n 1-1 1 Nostalgia. 

numbers scarcely express the lull extent to winch nostal- 
gia influenced the sickness and mortality of the army. To the 
depressing influence of home-sickness must be attributed the fatal 
result in many cases which might otherwise have terminated favor- 
ably. By the same cause may we ascribe a predisposition to have 
been produced favoring the reception and development of various 
morbific agents. Again, it is difficult to define the precise action 
of nostalgia, and to separate the morbid phenomena produced by it 
from those of an analogous character, produced by wholly different 
causes. In my opinion, it more probably existed as a complicating 
element in various morbid states than as a substantive disease. 
Viewed in this light, the foregoing figures would veiy inadequately 
represent the importance of nostalgia as influencing the stamina of 
the soldier. 

The term nostalgia is derived from two Greek words, signifying, 
in our vernacular, home-sickness.^ The derivation of the word 
indicates the pathology. It is a mental disorder, and belongs to 
the class melancholia. Certain physical symptoms precede, accom- 
pany, or follow the development of the mental aberration : heat 
of head ; increased rapidity of the circulation ; constipation ; gas- 
tro-intestinal disorders of various kinds ; a low febrile state simu- 
lating typhoid. The mental despondency and the exaltation of 
the imaginative faculty increase with the decline in the physical 
strength. Weeping, sighing, groaning, and a constant yearning 
for home ; hallucinations and sometimes maniacal delirium, are the 
particular forms in which the disorder of the brain expresses itself. 

Does the mental state precede the development of the physical 
symptoms? Is this sufficient of itself to produce that train of 
gastro-intestinal disorders and febrile phenomena which character- 
ize the progress of the case ? My own experience leads me to the 
conclusion that derangement of the health, particularly of the pri- 
mary assimilation, leads to the disorders of intellect, and that in 
those cases in which the affection of the mind precedes the physical

22 NOSTALGIA. 

disorders, there is much reason to suspect a predisposition to men- 
tal derangement to have existed. 

These questions are not without interest in view of the causes 
and degree of prevalence of nostalgia during the war. 

The primal cause is, undoubtedly, absence from home in new and 
strange surroundings. Various authors have affected to discover a 
cause in the character of the new country. Thus it is said that 
the mhabitants of mountainous districts are more prone to home- 
sickness than the denizen of the plain. The experience of the 
war hardly confirms this view of the influence of external nature. 
Both in the first and second year of the war, the number of re- 
ported cases were in a precise ratio to the number of troops em- 
ployed. There was no difference, as far as the statistics show, 
between the troops on the Atlantic coast and those in the interior 
region as to the prevalence of nostalgia. Hence it may be assumed 
that the face of the country in which the troops operated had no 
influence in the production of this disease. 

The cases which occmTcd under my observation were derived 
fi'om two classes : young men of feeble will, highly developed im- 
aginative faculties, and strong sexual desires ; married men, for the 
first time absent from their families. The monotony of winter 
camps favored the development of the peculiar mental and phys- 
ical effects of nostalgia, whilst active campaigning prevented their 
occmTcnce. Having too often no physical nor mental occupation, 
the minds of these unfortunates reverted homeward. They fell 
into reverie, and allowed their imaginations to run riot amid the 
images of home conjured up. Then followed melancholia, hallu- 
cinations, and physical phenomena due to disorder of the nervous 
system, such as borborygmi, constipation, indigestion, uTegular ac- 
tion of the heart, disturbed sleep, etc. This interdependence of 
the morbid physical state upon the mental was rather exceptional. 
Some derangement of the health in the main, preceded the mental 
phenomena. According to my observation, deranged sexual func- 
tions were more fi-equently precedent to the mental changes than 
any other single physical condition. Masturbation and spermator- 
rhoea produced a mental state more favorable to nostalgia than any 
other cause. This relation may not be expressed numerically, but 
if the history of the 2588 cases could be arrived at, the intimacy 
of the relation existing would be surprising. 

Only 13 deaths in 2588 cases ! This result might well cause us 
to question the accm'acy of the diagnosis. Of all diseases, nostal- 
gia is undoubtedly the most fatal ; none are less amenable to treat- 



FORMS OF MALINGERING. 23 



^P ment. A cure can only be wrought by sending the patient to his 
home. As this was not frequently possible during the war, it may 
be concluded that many cases reported as nostalgia were not really 

ISO, and that many fatal cases were reported under other names, 
probably as common continued fever. But this view is necessarily 
of limited scope. I have already remarked that, as a substantive 
disease, nostalgia was not common, but, as a complicating element 
in other diseases, very common. 
A rational man in a good state of health may bear up pretty 
well under ordinary home-sickness, but when his reason is weak- 
ened by disease, and his imagination excited by the monotony of 
the sick-bed, then it is that he becomes a prey to the hallucinations 
of nostalgia. Consequently it was in the general hospitals that 
this disease was most frequently observed as a complication of 
other maladies, and not as a substantive disease. In these cases 
the precise importance of it in determining a given result could not 
be estimated. The melancholy and mental depression associated 
with it must have favored the progress and increased the severity 
of various diseases. Nostalgia may be considered also in the hght 
of an element in that composite morbid state alluded to in the pre- 
ceding section, united in many cases with malaria, scorbutus, the 
effects of crowd-poisoning, etc. 

The most important of the moral causes affecting the physical 
endurance of the soldier, are those which may be com- Feigned 
prehended in the group — Feigned Diseases. Our *^^^^^^3- 
army furnished these cases on a stupendous scale. As this part 
of my subject will not be discussed elsewhere in these volumes, it 
is proper that it should be treated of here, at a length correspond- 
ing to its importance. 

To judge of the prevalence of malingering in our army, we 
must first understand the particular forms which the Forms of 
feigned maladies assumed. To study them intelhgently ""a^ag^rins- 
we must arrange them in classes and orders. 

The authors of the article on Feigned Diseases in the " Cyclope- 
dia of Practical Medicine " ^ have proposed some useful distinctions 
between the several groups : — 

1. Feigned, strictly so called, or those which are altogether fic- 
titious ; 

2. Exaggerated diseases, or those which, existing in some de- 
gree or form, are pretended by the patient to exist in a greater 
degree or in a different form ; 

1 Vol. ii. p. 123. Phil. ed. 



24 CAUSES OF MALINGERING. 

3. Factitious diseases, or those which are wholly produced by 
the patient, or with his concurrence ; 

4. Aggravated diseases, or those which, originating in the first 
instance without the patient's concurrence, are intentionally in- 
creased by artificial means. 

These terms are based upon well-marked distinctions, and are so 
useful that we shall employ them in the same sense. It is obvious, 
however, that it would be impracticable to make them the basis of 
a classification. In the article in the Cyclopgedia, no attempt is 
made to arrange feigned diseases in classes according to their affin- 
ities, but they are discussed simply in alphabetical order. In 
Gavin's prize essay ,^ a very artificial arrang(?ment is adopted, 
founded upon the symptoms referable to the feehngs of the pa- 
tient, and to those cognizable by the senses or acquired information 
of the physician, and on the means of diagnosis. Mr. Marshall^ 
treats of feigned and real disabilities together. Ballingall ^ treats 
of them according to the region of the body in which they occm'. 
So also Dr. Cheyne * in his very admirable letter to Dr. Renny. 
The authors of the article on Malingering in the "American Jour- 
nal of the Medical Sciences " for October, 1864, discuss the sev- 
eral forms of feigned diseases that came under their observation 
without any systematic arrangement. 

To facilitate the consideration of the subject of malingering 
during the war, I shall treat of the several topics in connection 
with it in the following order : — 

1. Causes of Malingering ; 

2. Degree of Prevalence ; 

3. Forms of Disability Assumed. 

a. Of the Cerebro-Spinal System ; 
h. Of the Thoracic Organs ; 

c. Of the Digestive System ; 

d. Of the Genito-Urinary Apparatus ; 

e. Of the Extremities ; 

/. Constitutional, or General. 
The causes of Malingering may be referred to either the men-

the influence of race, temperament, moral and intellectual train- 
ing, etc.

INFLUENCE OF RACE. 25 



^W There are no data for expressing numerically tlie influence of 
race, and hence we resort to the opinions based upon influence of 
pretty extensive personal observations. As our army, ^'^'''*- 
during the late war, was constituted mainly of Americans, Ger- 
mans, and Irish, the comparison is restricted to these three nation- 
alities. 

My own opinion is, decidedly, that the Germans were more 
given to malingering than the Americans and Irish. A larger pro- 
portion of them were mercenary soldiers attracted into the service 
by advance pay and bounty. They love ease, and the simple enjoy- 
ments to which they are accustomed at home, and have but little 
aptitude for military service. They do not have the physical en- 
durance of Americans or Irish, and are not possessed of the same 
degree of mental resiliency. They were much given to feign 
chronic rheumatic disease, affections of the urinary passages, and 
diarrhoea. 

The Irish soldiers in the English service, according to Marshall 
QOp. cit.')^ are much addicted to mahngering, and the " poorer class 
of laborers " are the worst in this respect. It has seemed to me 
that the Irish were less given to malingering than the Americans, 
but this opinion is not supported by any statistical evidence. They 
have, as a class, great hardihood, fondness for adventure, buoyancy 
of spirits, and a natural aptitude for military life and training. A 
large number entered our service as purely mercenary soldiers, 
and hence were not indisposed to avail themselves of all the in- 
dulgences to be procured by sick men. The class of Irish la- 
borers, especially, objected to fatigue duties, and would malinger 
to avoid them, when they would not think of doing so to avoid 
active and even dangerous military duty. " Sun-stroke " and pain 
in the back, were probably more frequently feigned than any other 
maladies by the Irish. 

The Americans, being vastly in the majority in our army, fur- 
nished the largest number of feigned cases ; but it is not true that 
they were in relative proportion the larger, except it may be by 
comparison with the Irish. The Americans were not to so large 
an extent mercenary soldiers. Indeed, a considerable percentage 
entered the service from motives of duty only. Nevertheless, 
advanced pay and bounty were not without influence upon large 
numbers who entered service neither in consequence of patriotic 
zeal nor fondness for military life. In the beginning of the war, 
the wide-spread enthusiasm forced many into the army who were 
every way disinclined and unfitted for it. At the same period dis-

charges on surgeon's certificate being given in most reckless pro- 
frision, all wlio were disposed to feign the most simple ailment 
fomid no difficulty in quitting the service. Many of this class en- 
listed again and again, to be discharged on some fictitious disease. 
When the professional " bounty-jumper " found his occupation too 
hazardous, he became a malingerer. The Americans who feigned 
disease consisted chiefly of mamed men separated fi'om their fam- 
ilies and homes for the first time. The particular forms which the 
feigned diseases of Americans assumed were affections of the re- 
spiratory organs, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, heart-disease, etc. 

The influence of moral and intellectual training was strikingly

training. occasioual cascs. One of the most expert malingerers 
that came under my observation was a Michigan school-teacher. 
Generally, the men who feign disease belong to the lower orders, 
to the class of common laborers, and are ignorant and uneducated. 
In this view, I exclude, of course, the " bounty-jumpers " and 
malingerers by profession, who added to their evil tendencies the 
skill acquired by education. The disposition to malinger did not 
come of the associations of the camp, but was the natural direc- 
tion of an originally bad character. As a general rule, it may be 
affirmed that men will feign disease in the army who are guilty 
of similar deceptions in civil pursuits.

ment. ' Duiiug tlic War, the practice of malingering seemed asso- 
ciated with the bilious and nervous temperaments, whilst the san- 
guine was comparatively exempt. " The typical malingerer has 
dark-brown or hazel eyes, dark hair and dark complexion ; his 
face is stealthy, dogged, lowering; his eyes suspicious, fartive, 
restless ; and his manner habitually constrained." ^ 

If a man have the mental and moral characteristics for feign- 
ing, slight causes suffice to develop them in some practical direc- 
tion. 

A variety of other causes may be enumerated as producing

PREVALENCE OF MALINGERING. 27 

number escaped to the rear with feigned or factitious injuries. 
Personal difficulties with their comrades, punishments, capricious 
conduct of their officers influenced many ; .and pique, disappoint- 
ment as to promotion influenced others. The most powerftd of all 
causes affecting those not disposed to malinger in consequence of 
deficient moral sense, was the influence of wives and relations. To 
the reception of a piteous or complaining letter from home could 
often be traced the commencement of the deception. The readi- 
with which discharges were obtained dui'ing the first three 
years of the war, and the numerous successful instances of im- 
posture contributed to the prevalence of mahngering by suggesting 
the idea to those who had not previously conceived it, and by en- 
couraging those whose timidity, rather than want of inclination, 
prevented engaging in a course of deception. Beside, such defects 
in military organization and such disregard of military law, as per- 
mitted or could not check the wholesale depletion of the ranks of 
the army by discharges on surgeon's certificate, disgusted those 
who would otherwise have been wilHng to bear for the sake of the 
cause all needful hardships. 

The organization of general hospitals in the several States for 
the reception of the soldiers of the State was an ill-ad- Bad effect of

tion of malingerers. Large numbers feigned disease to be sent to 
the hospital nearest their homes. 

But from whatever cause the disposition to malinger arose, the 
success of the attempt depended much upon the skill and firm- 
ness of the regimental and medical officers, and upon the degree of 
discipline. When a malingerer once succeeded in passing beyond 
the control and observation of those who knew him, his subsequent 
operations were much less difficult. Unfortunately, the medical 
officers of the regiment and the enlisted men were frequently neigh- 
bors and associates before the war, and hence the same control 
could not be exercised as if they had been strangers to each other. 
In the regiment all cases of malingering should be confronted and 
disposed of.

28 MALINGERING SHOWN BY SICK REPORTS. 

As a general rule, soldiers feign those diseases with which they 
are most familiar, whether by personal experience, or by obser- 
vation. This is seen in tlie character of the disabilities feigned 
by the diiferent nationahties : thus the Germans were given to 
chronic rheumatism ; the Americans to diseases of the respirators^ 
organs, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, heart-disease, etc. ; and the Irish to 
" pain in the back," sun-stroke, chronic rheumatism, etc. The 
correlative fact is, that those diseases are feigned which are easily 
simulated and not readily detected. Comparing these two facts 
with the statistics of discharges on surgeon's certificate, an approx- 
imation sufficiently close for our purpose may be arrived at. In 
illustration of this, we may take rheumatism, consumption, debil- 
ity, and epilepsy, for example. Thus, the discharges for rheu- 
matism for the first year of the war were 3585 ; for consumption, 
3161 ; for debility, 3139 ; and for epilepsy, 669. So numerous 
were the discharges for chronic rheumatism, that an order was 
issued by the War Department, at the close of 1862, forbidding 
any discharges for this cause. The discharges for " incipient 
phthisis " became so fi*equent, and exemptions under the Enroll- 
ment Act for this disease so numerous, that it was not permitted as 
a disqualification in the draft of 1864. 

In the first year of the war, there were a large number of dis- 
infirmities chargcs for infirmities which existed at the time of en- 
Stmeat. listmcnt (concealed infirmities). Insanity, epilepsy, and 
hernia may be classed in this category. There were 246 cases of 
insanity, 669 of epilepsy, and 2300 of hernia discharged in the 
first year of the war, a vast majority of which existed at the time 
of enlistment, but were concealed. These concealed infirmities 
became much less frequent after the first year, and were replaced 
by feigned or factitious diseases, — rheumatism, heart-disease, in- 
cipient phthisis, deafness, defects of vision, etc., feigned ; vari- 
cocele, hemorrhoids, old wounds and injuries, etc., exaggerated ; 
and chronic diarrhoea, ophthalmia, etc., produced. The improve- 
ment in the art of feigning became very manifest as the war pro- 
gressed. Whilst the discharges for heart-disease amounted to 30 
per 1000 in 1862, in 1863 they reached the large proportion of 
137 per 1000. The same increase was observed in respect to 
phthisis. 

The reports of sick, as well as of discharges, furnish some inter- 
Maiingering cstiug Statistical facts bearing on the question of malin- 
lick^reportB. gcriug. In two ycars, 162,276 men came on to the sick

per 1000 of mean strength. In the second year of the war, there 
were reported 40,758 cases of constipation, 20,645 cases of head- 
ache, and 775 cases of deafness. There were also reported, the 
same year, 9977 cases of hernia, and 2585 cases of epilepsy, many 
of which, undoubtedly, should be considered as concealed infirmi- 
ties. Whilst in the first year of the war 330 cases of paralysis 
came upon " sick report," in the second year they rose up to 
1164. Again, whilst the cases of neuralgia, in the first year of the 
war, amounted to 7546, in the second year they reached 18,533, 
an increase considerably out of proportion to the increase in the 
numerical strength of the amiy. 

It has been already remarked, that soldiers feign those diseases 
with which they are most familiar, provided the simu- Forms of 
lation is easy and the detection difiicult. The cases of ass^eZ 
feigned diseases proper were not nearly so numerous as the exag- 
gerated ailments. Many who became acquainted with the ease 
and comforts of the hospital whilst suffering under some petty ail- 
ment, continued to complain after recovery to avoid a return to 
duty. The cases of factitious disease were infrequent. 

Of the Cerebro-Spinal System. — Durmg the first two years of 
the war, there were reported 27,779 cases of headache. Headache 
Many of these were malarial in character, no doubt, gia. 
and many were due to indigestion ; nevertheless, a large propor- 
tion were feigned or exaggerated, to escape some temporary un- 
pleasant duty, or to procure admission into the general hospital. 
Neuralgia, and pain affecting the distribution of the fiflh pair, were 
simulated as well as exaggerated. The 26,079 cases reported in 
two years contained many of this character. They were difficult 
of detection, because all the phenomena were purely subjective. 
No difficulty existed when the neuralgia produced objective signs. 
" When a man positively affirms that he suffers great pain in some 
portion of the body," says Dr. Woodward,^ " it seems to the pop- 
ular mind absurd for a surgeon to affirm that he does not." It 
was one of the most common experiences during the war, for the 
sm-geon to meet cases of pretended pain without any evidences of 
suffering. That the majority of these cases came upon sick report 
merely for the purpose of escaping a temporary duty which was 
unpleasant, is shown by the statistics of discharges. Thus, of the 
7134 cases of headache, and 7546 cases of neuralgia, occurring 
in the first year of the war, only 8 of the former and 39 of the 
latter were finally discharged. Excluding those who were prob-

ably the subjects of malarial poisoning, and those who suffered 
from carious teeth, there must remain a considerable number who 
feigned or exaggerated this disability. But that they did not per- 
sist in feigning, is evident both by the statistics of discharge and 
by the observations of myself and others. 

I have met with numerous cases of vertigo which were referred 
to an attack of " sun-stroke " as the cause. These oc-

tack of coup-de-soleil. In the first year of the war there were re- 
ported 420 cases and 17 deaths from this cause, and 1199 cases and 
57 deaths in the second year. The cases which came under my 
observation were more probably feigned than exaggerated. "In 
none of them were there any appreciable lesions or impairment of 
any of the fimctions or organs. All of them complained of strange 
sensations in the head, and vertigo. A singular expression was 
imparted to the countenance of two of them by wearing a hand- 
kerchief around the head ; and a third wore green glasses." ^ 
Many cases of feigned sun-stroke originated in the temporary loss 
of consciousness produced by heat, fatigue, and anxiety, in which 
no lesion of the nervous centres occurs, but recovery ensues 
promptly. The dread of return to duty induced them to feign 
symptoms, alleged after-effects of the seizure. 

Insanity was occasionally feigned in the beginning of the war. 
The number of discharges for this cause exceeded the 
number of cases reported. Thus the number on sick re- 
port was 227, and the number discharged 246. According to my 
own statistics, the discharges for this cause were for the first year 
11 per 1000, and the second year 7 per 1000. The decrease is to 
be attributed to two causes — the elimination of the real cases, 
and the diminution of feigned cases. The regulations of the army 
forbid the discharge of insane soldiers, and require them to be sent 
to the government asylum ; but this regulation was not observed 
with any degree of particularity until the last year of the war. 
But to the increasino; observance of the remilation is to be attrib- 
uted the cessation of feigned cases. Drs. Mitchell, Morehouse, 
and Keen are in error in asserting that no cases of feigned insanity 
occurred during the war. They overlooked my observations on 
this point. It is certainly time that the higher forms of insanity 
were not attempted by malingerers. I found in one instance a 
certificate of disability on which a man had been discharged for

EPILEPSY. 81 

inability to learn his military duties ; liis intellect and intelligence 
being, on all other points, sufficiently good ! This was undoubt- 
edly a case of malingering. Several of a similar character have 
been observed by me. Dementia, or imbecility, are the forms 
which the malingerers assumed, and they usually contented them- 
selves with feigning loss of memory, inability to learn the manual, 
immobility of manner, and filthy personal habits. Drs. Mitchell, 
Morehouse, and Keen say, in reference to our soldiers, " any one 
who would feign insanity and submit to its restraints and associa- 
tions to avoid work and obtain ease, must be, in reality, a mono- 
maniac." Our malingerers, however, did not attempt the higher 
types of insanity. This would have been undergoing unnecessary 
trouble to accomplish their object, and might have subjected them 
to the risk of being sent to the asylum. 

Paralysis was a very common feigned disability, in its several 
forms of hemiplegia, paraplegia, and paralysis of a single 
limb or set of muscles. Quite a number of cases of para- 
plegia came under my observation. The usual history was, that 
they had suffered a blow upon the spine by a shell or by a fall, or 
that they had had lumbago, or that the paraplegia had followed ex- 
posure to cold and wet. The most usual form of feigned paralysis, 
however, was loss of power in one of the upper extremities. This 
occurs so rarely as a real condition, unless associated with obvious 
lesions, that a vast majority of these cases were feigned. Drs. 
Mitchell, Morehouse, and Keen have observed several cases,^ and 
I have met with a number. In the first year of the war 330 
cases of paralysis came upon sick report, and 252 were discharged 
from the service. In the second year 1164 cases were reported. 
A certain proportion of these were feigned, but as to the exact 
number we have no means of determining]:. 

Epilepsy chiefly occurred as a concealed infirmity. In the 
statistics collected by me, I find that the discharges for 
epilepsy reached 22 per 1000. The discharges for this ^^'^^^'^' 
cause in the first year were 669, whilst 2585 cases came upon sick 
report. This extraordinary discrepancy — for in the beginning all 
cases were discharged — can only be accounted for on the theory 
that many of them were feigned and the imposture detected. 
Five cases came under my own personal observation. There was 
no difficulty in detecting the imposture in these cases. Messrs. 
Mitchell, Morehouse, and Keen are severe upon those authors who 
regard the assumed disease as easy of detection, and " speak of it

32 DEFECTS OF VISION. 

with a flippancy which shows conclusively that they have seen but 
little of the disease." This criticism is hardly just. In those 
feigned cases in which these very accurate gentlemen had much 
difficulty in making a diagnosis, it is not beyond the limits of pos- 
sibility that they were deceived. The malingerers in our service 
were not sufficiently expert to produce so exact a portraiture as 
these gentlemen describe, and which confused even them. In my 
cases the epileptic paroxysm consisted in violent convulsive move- 
ments carried on with the most obvious effort of the will. 

Deafness has been frequently feigned ; it was also, in the begin- 
ning of the war, a concealed infirmity, and during the 
whole war, exaggerated. The statistics of discharges for 
this cause prove this. There were reported in the first year 273 
cases and 260 discharges ; in the second year, 775 cases came on 
to the sick report. In 10,991 discharges on surgeon's certificate 
examined by me, there were 169 for deafness. Notwithstanding 
the statement of Messrs. Mitchell, Morehouse, and Keen, there 
can be no doubt that this disability was frequently feigned or exag- 
gerated. It is probably true that exaggerated cases were more 
numerous than the feigned. A diminution in the accuracy and 
delicacy of the organ of hearing is a not uncommon sequela of the 
eruptive fevers, without the occurrence of inflammation and its 
results, and may occur in typhoid fever. Such dullness of hearing 
was exaggerated into complete abolition of the faculty. 
Defects of T\\Q defccts of visiou feigned belonged to the three 

^^°'^' classes : feigned, exaggerated, and factitious. 

Ptosis was feigned several times in my experience. One fla- 
grant case was seen by me in which a man had escaped duty 
four months, and finally reached the general hospital, in which a 
simple closure of the palpebrss was the only symptom. He was 
tenderly cared for and led by a comrade who had " diarrhe ! " 
Ophthalmia tarsi was frequently exaggerated, and was probably 
also occasionally produced, or at least aggravated. The same re- 
mark is true of granular lids. Ten cases were observed by me in 
which I suspected the disability had been aggravated, but I was 
never able to determine the fact positively. 

Myopia was a very common exaggerated ailment. This may 
not be demonstrated numerically, but every observant medical 
officer was cognizant of the fact. It was sometimes also a factitious 
disability, if such a term may be applied to the production of such 
merely objective signs of myopia, as holding objects close to the 
eyes and corrugation of the eyelids. As a small degree of myopia 



DISEASES OF LUNGS AKD HEART. 33 

did not constitute a case for exemption, those forced into the ser- 
vice under the Enrollment Act almost invariably exaggerated their 
infirmity, to procure a discharge. Several cases came under my 
observation in which myopia was concealed at the time of enlist- 
ment, and afterwards exaggerated. One of these, who had done 
no service, remained several months in a hospital under my charge, 
and whenever desired to give an account of his ailment, produced 
fi'om his pocket a much worn bed-card, on which was inscribed — 
" Retinitis." 

Total blindness was not frequently simulated. Such a condition 
would have been too inconvenient to suit the purposes of the ma- 
lingerer. Partial loss of vision was the form of disability assumed. 
This was feigned outright, or predicated upon visible defects of the 
eye, as opacity of the cornea, pterygion, etc. In the first year 
of the war, there were discharged for diseases of the eye 529 
cases, of which Amaurosis and Ophthalmia furnished nearly one 
half. 

One case of exaggerated disability of the nose came under my 
observation — a small polypus — for which the soldier escaped 
duty for a long period, and was probably eventually discharged. 

Dumbness has also been feigned. In one case, the man alleged 
that his dumbness was produced by the concussion of a 
shell. He carried a pencil and paper, ostentatiously pro- 
ducing it when questioned to write down his answers. Another, 
with a similar history, relied upon some guttural sounds and pan- 
tomime to make known his wants. 

Of the Thoracic Organs. — The discharges for aphonia in the 
first year of the war amounted to 42. In 15,500 dis- 
charges examined by me, there were 28 for this cause. 
It was a comparatively frequent feigned disability. In the cases 
seen by me, the patients professed to have lost the voice suddenly, 
and were unable to assign any satisfkctory reason for the occur- 
rence. When questioned, they replied in a whisper. A majority 
of those discharged were doubtless feigned. 

The discharges for diseases of the lungs and heart included a 
number of feigned, factitious, and exaggerated cases. Diseases of 
A condition simulating " incipient phthisis " was both SV 
feigned and factitious. In the first year of the war, 5599 cases 
were admitted to the sick report, and 3161 were discharged on 
surgeon's certificate. A large number of these were classed as 
cases of incipient phthisis. No disease was more successftJly 
simulated during the war. Many of these factitious cases pre- 



34 LIVER COMPLAINT. 

sented considerable difficulty In diagnosis, for It must be admitted 
that the physical signs of Incipient phthisis are by no means con- 
clusive. Cough kept up persistently by the voluntary efforts of 
the patient ; the addition of blood from the mouth or nares to the 
expectoration ; confinement In a hospital ward, and the deteriora- 
tion in health consequent thereon ; spermatorrhoea or masturbation 
may be united in any case to produce a set of symptoms, with 
difficulty distinguishable from those of the early stages of phthisis. 
A congested state of the throat, with nervous cough, indigestion, 
and emaciation, results from profuse tobacco chewing, and this state 
also may be confounded with incipient phthisis. These two classes 
of cases were exceedingly common. 

In 10,446 discharges examined by me, there were 629 for heart- 
disease. In 1131 discharges during the months of January and 
February, 1863, there were 217 for the same cause. A large 
number of these were cases at the convalescent camp near Alex- 
andria, Va. This extraordinary Increase in the relative proportion 
of heart cases to other forms of disease Is solely attributable to 
malingering. Functional derangement of the heart was produced 
by various causes, amongst which may be enumerated all of those 
agencies causative in factitious phthisis. The functional derange- 
ment produced by these causes was not to be distinguished from 
that produced by lowered vitality of the blood, resulting from a 
scorbutic taint, malaria, etc. The malingerers feigning heart- 
disease had, frequently, not been exposed to these causes of disa- 
blHty, and had enjoyed, for a more or less considerable period, the 
good diet and comforts of the general hospital. 

Of the Digestive System, — The statistics of the first year of the 
war Indicate a large number of concealed, feigned, and 
exaggerated cases. Thus, there were discharged for dys- 
pepsia 69 cases. This Is an unusual disease in the army, and 
rarely disabling. Amongst these 69 cases were some cases of the 
concealed, many more of the exaggerated, and probably a few of 
the feigned class. During the war, when the malingerers became 
more skillful, factitious dyspepsia was not uncommon. In two in- 
stances the power of vomiting at will was observed by me. Messrs. 
Mitchell, Morehouse, and Keen record another case. They were 
not common.

titious ailment. In two instances the factitious disease was ex- 
plained by the discovery of " Wright's Indian Vegetable Pills," 
concealed about the persons of the invalids. In the first year of the 
war there were admitted to the sick report 215,214 cases of diar- 
rhoea and dysentery. A number of these were feigned, but the 
exact number cannot be ascertained. The cases of diarrhoea, 
without any impairment of strength or nutrition, were numerous in 
the general hospitals. 

5713 cases of piles were reported, and 215 discharges for this 
cause in the first year of the war. This disability was 

Piles. 

very commonly exaggerated. Some instances of feigning 
also came under my observation. In these cases the malingerers 
contented themselves with asserting that the piles were internal 
and bleeding. 

Of Urinary and Gfenital Apparatus. — The feigned diseases of 
this system were both simulated and exae'^erated. 

. , ^ , . T . Hematuria. 

Amongst tiie former were Hematuria, spermatorrhoea, m- 
continence of urine, gravel, " kichiey disease," etc., and amongst 
the latter varicocele, spermatori'hoea, hydrocele, stricture of the 
urethra, etc. I have met with three cases of feigned hematuria, in 
which the deception consisted in mixing blood from the mouth with 
the urine. These mahngerers complained of exquisite pain in 
micturition, and presented as evidence bloody urine. They were 
also loud in complaints about weakness of the back, which required 
them to go much bent. There was no harmony between the 
severe s^nnptoms complained of and the general good health of 
these men. 

Several cases of feigned spermatorrhoea have, from time to time, 
been under my observation. In one case hereditary tend- gpermator- 
ency was alleged. Two classes of cases were observed '^'**^" 
during the war : those entirely feigned and factitious ; those exist- 
ing in slight degree exaggerated, either in consequence of the fears 
of the patient or to procure a discharge. 

In the first year of the war 170 cases of incontinence of urine 
were reported ; but in the second year the number inconti- 
rose up to 1280 cases. This extraordinary increase in unne. 
numbers indicates a 2;reat increase in feimied cases. There were 
discharged the service in the first year 36 cases. These figures 
accord with my own observation ; for incontinence of urine has 
seemed to me to be one of the most fi^equently feigned of the 
whole class. In the cases seen by me the malingerer made no 
pretense of being afflicted with any other trouble. When com-

plicated with calculus, paralysis of the bladder, or disease of the 
spinal cord, there can be no difficulty in determining the reality of 
the alleged suflPering or disability. 

Gravel also was frequently feigned. An officer attempted to 
pass off bits of plaster as small calcuH which he had

discharged from the bladder. The cases seen amongst 
soldiers were feigned outright. For stone and gravel 93 came on 
to the sick report in the first year, and 867 in the second, whilst 
only 8 were discliarged for this cause in the first year. Tliese 
figures indicate that this disability was frequently feigned. 

" Kidney disease " was a tenn much in use by malingerers to 
j^i^^gy express a condition which seemed to them to authorize a 
disease. discharge. Pain in the lumbar region which prevented 
them going upright ; pain and difficulty in urination, and debility, 
were the symptoms expressed. Of the reality of some of these 
cases in which oxalate of lime, excess of urea, and excess of uric 
acid, were manifest, there can be no doubt. In such instances 
there were abundant evidences of lesions of primary and second- 
ary assimilation, or of both. In the feigned cases these evidences 
were wanting. 

There were 988 cases of varicocele reported in the first year of 
the war, and 3504 cases in the second year ; and in the 
first year there were discharged 287 cases. In 10,991 
discharges, I found 116 for varicocele. This disease was therefore 
very commonly exaggerated. A large proportion of the cases 
discharged were for inadequate reasons. Varicocele may exist to 
a considerable extent without impairing the physical efficiency. 
When both testes are affected, such serious mental and moral con- 
sequences may ensue as to require discharge ; but few cases of this 
kind were to be observed in the large number who came on to the 
sick report. That a slight degree of enlargement of the veins was 
sufficient to procure exemption from duty, is evident enough on 
comparing the statistics of this disease for the first two years of 
the war. 

Hydrocele and stricture of the urethra may be classed amongst 
Hydrocele the exaggerated disabilities, but they were not met with 
ure. frequently. A few instances of feigned stricture have 

been observed by me. 

Of the Extremities. — As the integrity of the extremities is essen- 
tial to the proper performance of mihtary duties, feigned and exag- 
gerated diseases, and injuries of these parts, presented a promising 
field for the exercise of the malingerer's art. Hence, the affections 




LAMENESS. 37 

of the extremities were feigned and exaggerated, and were also 
occasionally factitious. 

Spurious anchylosis or contraction, the alleged result of rheu- 
matic disease, was a very common feigned disability, ppuriousan- 
The elbow, wrist, and knee were, in my experience, <^^yi°^'s- 
the joints usually selected for the deception. There were, during 
the war, some very remarkable instances of persistent feigning of 
immobility of a joint. In one case, a man carried his knee flexed 
upon his thigh nine months ; in another, a man carried his fingers 
flexed for eighteen months for a simple wound of forearm, involv- 
ing only the integument. Contractions, following gimshot injuries 
of soft parts, were very frequently exaggerated, and were also aggra- 
vated by the opposition of the patient to the means of cure. Many 
cases are involuntary, the patient nursing a wounded limb to pre- 
vent the pain of motion, and persisting in this treatment until 
contraction results ; but many willfully resisted the efforts of the 
surgeon to bring the hmb into use, thereby inducing such loss of 
function as to incapacitate for further military service. In addition 
to these, the cases of feigning in which no lesion existed were quite 
numerous. In such instances the patient professed to have lost 
motion, and when effort was made to ascertain the truth, simply 
resisted, by the exercise of his will, the attempt. The extent to 
which malingering was carried in this direction is conclusively 
shown in the statistics of discharge for anchylosis, of which there 
were 199 cases in the first year of the war. 

Lameness was assigned as a cause of discharge in 71 cases in 
10,991 certificates of disability. During the war it was 
only necessary for a man to assume a cane or a crutch 
and to limp in order to procure admission to the hospital. From 
general hospital to convalescent camp, these cases were continually 
transferred, and, although repeatedly exposed, they could always 
procure sympathy and countenance in a new place. On the way 
to the front after having been caught feigning, and exposed, it was 
only necessary to assume the inevitable cane and to limp, to be 
admitted to some other malingerer's asylum. Old fractures and 
injuries which had occurred long anterior to admission into service, 
were frequently exaggerated. If the mahngerer were so fortunate 
as to retain any evidence upon his person of former injury, as a 
cicatrix, or deformity of a bone, he was quite certain to parade it, 
to exaggerate his sufferings in consequence of it, and to demand a 
discharge for disability, having faithfidly tried to serve his country, 
notwithstanding he was physically disqualified. 



od DEBILITY AND RHEUMATISM. 

In the same category may we class varicose veins. The nmn- 
varicose ^^^ ^^ thcse cascs on sick report was enormous ; in the 
veins. gj.g^ year 776, and in the second year 3344. At first 

the concealed cases were eliminated, the discharges in 10,991 cer- 
tificates being 213 for varicose veins ; but afterwards the exagger- 
ated cases came forward to claim exemption from duty. 

Another form of feigned disability of the extremities, very curious 
Swelling of as to its causc and character, was swellincr of an inferior 

an inferior . . in 

extremity, extremity. This I observed m a number of cases, of 
which there were ten at one time in a hospital mider my charge. 
Messrs. Mitchell, Morehouse, and Keen also observed one case. 
This swelling was alleged to have existed for a considerable time, 
and no explanation of the mode of its production Avas vouchsafed 
by those affected. " Careful search at miexpected times, even at 
midnight, never disclosed the slightest trace of a ligature or press- 
ure upon the veins. The swelhng seemed to be produced by 
keeping the leg habitually crossed upon the other, or, as the report- 
ers of the case above mentioned suggest, by keeping " his leg rest- 
ing on his crutch." 

Constitutional or General. — In 28,640 discharges on surgeon's 
Debility and Certificate for the first year of the war, there were 6724 
rheumatism. £^j, debility and rheumatism, or nearly one in four. 
These figures include a large number of feigned and exaggerated 
cases. Debility was a term applied to the low vital condition re- 
sulting from fever and from a variety of morbid states. But, to a 
considerable extent, it was also a factitious state, arising from all 
those abuses to which soldiers are addicted — indulgence in alco- 
holic drinks, masturbation, excessive tobacco chewing, etc. 

But debility was a less frequently feigned ailment than rheuma- 
tism. In the first year of the war 44,762 cases of rheumatic dis- 
ease came upon sick report, and 3585 cases were discharged. In 
the second year the cases reached 81,435. So numerous were the 
cases and discharges for rheumatism that a general order was 
issued by the War Department forbidding any discharges for this 
cause. A large number of these cases consisted of lumbago, or 
were " back cases," as they were familiarly styled in the general 
hospitals. Every hospital had its quota of these cases. They re- 
ferred their sufferings to exposure or to injury. To give color to 
the expressions of pain, they Avould flinch and cry out when the 
back was examined ; they went about half bent, and they used, in 
the most ostentatious manner, crutches or a cane. When closely 
examined as to all the ch^cumstances under which the injury or dis- 




DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF FEIGNING. 39 

ability occurred, they were frequently betrayed into the most im- 
probable and often ludicrous statements. The incongruity between 
the history, expressions of suffering, and general good condition of 
these back cases was often strongly marked. 

Dr. Woodward ^ is disposed to refer many of these cases of 
lumbar pain and weakness to the existence of a scorbutic taint. 
He reiterates this statement in Circular No. 6 of 1865, p. 134 : 
" The scorbutic taint manifested itself very generally in the form 
of rheumatic pains in the back and limbs, associated with the scor- 
butic, clay-like appearance of the skin, sometimes even with spongi- 
ness of the gums, much more rarely with petechiae, scorbutic dis- 
colorations about the flexures of the knees," etc. The back cases 
so commonly seen in our general hospitals do not answer to tliis 
description. Such evident marks of disease could hardly be mis- 
taken by any intelHgent medical officer for malingering. 

Contractions of muscles and immobihty of joints, the alleged 
result of rheumatism, were exceedingly common. These contractions

the most painfrd way and complaining piteously, whilst enjoying 
the most robust health. Such cases could not be confounded with 
pains attendant upon scorbutus. 

The feigned diseases described in this section are the principal 
forms that occurred in our service during the late war. I have 
discussed those which have fallen under my own observation, and 
have purposely excluded all references to mahngering as it occurs 
in foreign armies. 

No reference was made to the diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis 
of the various forms of feigning. Some general remarks ^enS*" 
on these subjects will not be inappropriate. feigning. 

The cases of successftil imposture were not frequent. Surgeons 
usually recognized them, or at least suspected them for good rea- 
sons. Numbers were discharged who succeeded simply by virtue 
of obstinate perseverance, the surgeon being the first to give in. 
The duties which the surgeon was required to peixbrm in relation 
to malingering were very unpleasant. To detect and expose im- 
posture was unpopular, and also exposed the surgeon to misconcep- 
tion and abuse. The citizen soldiers who feigned disease relied on 
the services and sacrifices of their faithful comrades to secure them 
immunity from exposure and punishment. They traded on the 
blood of the fallen. Notwithstanding the difficulties in the way, 
the surgeons, as a general rule, strove faithfully to maintain the 
discipline of the army, by discountenancing imposture.

40 GRANTING OF CERTIFICATES OF DISABILITY. 

In the diagnosis of malingering the medical officers relied upon 
the indications afforded by the incongruities of the patient, upon 
systematic surveillance, upon strategy, and upon the use of anaes- 
thetics. Patients who feigned disease, except in exceptional cases 
of expertness, rarely told a consistent story as to the causes, progress, 
duration, and symptoms of their malady. The state of good health 
in many of them was in striking opposition to their expressions of 
pain and suffering. Subjected to surveillance in the general hos- 
pital, all but the most expert malingerers were usually easily caught 
in some acts inconsistent with their professions of disease. The 
address of the surgeon himself, in cases of amaurosis, paralysis, 
and lameness, was often quite sufficient of itself to expose a ma- 
lingerer. The most important means for the detection of feigning is 
the inhalation of ether. This was largely resorted to during the 
war, and proved to be adapted to a very wide circle of feigned 
cases. 

To detect imposture, to separate real from simulated cases, re- 
quired a competent knowledge of disease under all its varied as- 
pects. Whenever a malingerer succeeded, the surgeon had either 
been wearied or deceived. 

During the war the newspapers teemed with complaints of the 
Complaints harshuess and severity of medical officers. These were, 
and severity usually. Written by malingerers themselves, but they none 
officers. the less excited the indignation of the public. These ac- 
cusations were almost invariably unjust. If the medical officers 
failed in the performance of any of their duties, the failure was 
due rather to defects of training than to inhumanity or prejudice. 
As a class, they were the best friends of the soldiers during the 
war. Their labors and sacrifices were all directed to improve the 
health, and cure the diseases and injuries of the soldiers. Yet it 
was a sad fact, that the regimental surgeons who were engaged in 
these humane offices were less popular than those whose duty made 
them agents for destruction of health and life.

General Order 212 of 1863 defined the disabilities for which sol- 
diers could be discharged, and the irregularities which previously 
existed were thereby corrected. No certificates were sufficient until 
they had received the approval of the medical directors of corps, 
army, and department. Early in the war regimental and district

GRANTING OF CERTIFICATES OF DISABILITY. 41 

commanders often exercised the authority to discharge, and many- 
men were thus dismissed without the least regard to the require- 
ments of law. The most serious abuse existing in this respect was 
the disposition of the certificate of disability, which was frequently 
given to the soldier discharged instead of being forwarded to the 
adjutant-general. Hence the statistics of discharges on surgeon's 
certificate for the first two years of the w^ar do not accurately 
represent the whole number of discharges. 

Notwithstanding the pension laws and the army regulations based 
upon them require that the degree of disabihty shall be stated nu- 
merically, this was constantly disregarded in the first two years of 
the war. And throughout the whole war there was no uniformity 
in the views of medical officers in respect to the degree in which 
any particular disease or injury incapacitated a man for earning 
his subsistence by manual labor. In the French military service, 
precise rules govern those empowered to discharge for disability. 
Similar regulations should be introduced into our service. Uni- 
formity in expressing the degree of disability for any particular 
disease, and especially injury, would insure justice to the soldier, 
and protect the interests of the government.

FIRST DUTY OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER. 43 

whole energies was diverted into preparations for war ! All classes 
were affected alike ; all trades and professions yielded with equal 
enthusiasm to the call for troops. Since then, millions of soldiers 
(2,759,049) have joined the army, fought many of the bloodiest 
battles of history, and, with the loss of a vast number of lives by 
disease and wounds, the object of the war has been accomplished, 
and a large proportion of those who remained have disappeared in 
the by-ways of peaceful pursuits ! And this army was accom- 
panied by thousands of medical officers, called from civil life to 
treat milhons of cases of disease and wounds. 

This vast amount of labor and responsibihty devolved at once 
upon the medical profession ; and the newly appointed Early embar- 
medical officer was ushered without preparation into the'Te"wi/^ 
positions of weighty responsibility. He had to learn his me£l?*^offi- 
duty, and to practice it at the same time ; and he soon dis- *'^'^- 
covered that he had but httle written authority to consult, and that 
experience must be his teacher. It cannot be said of the corps of 
regular surgeons, who had been educated in the service, that they 
were to a much greater degree quahfied for the emergency. Their 
services had generally been performed at small frontier posts, 
where the routine of duty was so limited as to tend by long habit 
to disqualify for the greatly enlarged and practical effort that was 
now required ; and, while we naturally looked to them as directors 
and instructors, we were disappointed to find that they had no in- 
structions to give other than those which were to be found in the 
Army Regulations. These " Regulations " embraced but little 
more than directions how to procure medical supplies, by requisi- 
tion, and to prescribe the forms for certain reports ; and howsoever 
well they might have answered the requirements of the army in 
time of peace, they were totally inadequate now with an army of 
hmidreds of thousands in active service. The new medical offi- 
cer, therefore, was thro^vn from the first upon his own resources ; 
and whatever of excellence characterized the medical department 
of the army at the close of the war, was the result of the apti- 
tude of the American mind to adapt itself to any emergency that 
calls forth its action. 

The first duty of the medical officer was the examination of 
recruits. The plan of voluntary enlistment, relied upon First duty of

44 BAD EFFECTS OF THE VOLUNTEER RECRUITING. 

the volunteer service it was not necessary to be as severe as if ex- 
amining for the regular army. This was a great error to com- 
mence with, and aside from the bad effects for the government, it 
proved fatal to thousands of patriotic, but feeble and unhealthy men, 
who might now have been living and pursuing useful occupations. 
Feeble boys, toothless old men, consumptives, asthmatics, one- 
eyed, one-armed men, men with different length of legs, club- 
footed and ruptured, and, in short, men with every variety of 
disability, and whose systems were replete with the elements of in- 
cipient disease, were accepted as recruits, and started to the field 
only to become a tax upon the government, and to encumber the 
movements of its armies. It has been said by an eminent officer, 
whose services have been constantly in the field (Major General 
Thos. J. Wood), writing on mihtary organization, " that statistics 
derived from the observations of the closest observers, Hneal and 
medical officers, disclose the startling fact that, as a rule, through- 
out the entire war, not more than thirty-five per cent, of the 
muster-roll strength of the armies of the Union appeared on the 
battle-field bearing muskets ! " Many causes operated to produce 
this discrepancy, but none so potent as the loose manner of recruit- 
ing that prevailed ; and it is surprising that after all the embarrass- 
ments to the service that resulted fi'om this cause, effective meas- 
ures were not taken sooner to correct the evil. But various influ- 
ences continued to operate throughout the war inimical to the 
thorough inspection of the recruit. Governors of States, in their 
great anxiety to fill their quotas promptly, grew intent upon meas- 
ures that would be most sure to bring forth numbers, unmindful of 
the fact that, not numbers alone, but healthful vigorous men, give 
strength to an army. Even as late as the fall of 1864, in the last 
levy under the Conscription Act, the looseness of recruiting existed 
to such an extent that the Secretary of War deemed it necessary 
to publish Circular No. 67, of date August, 1864, requiring a re- 
examination, by experienced medical officers, of all men, at the sev- 
eral States' rendezvous, before being sent to the field ; ordering all 
to be discharged, accoi-ding to the provisions of the regulations, 
who were found to be unfit for active field service. I was President 
of the Board of Examiners for Ohio, where we reexamined about 
8000 men, and discharged 266. The ratio of men rejected by the 
Board was much greater during the first period of our examinations, 
but grew less as it became known to the recruiting and mustering 
officers and boards of enrollment throughout the State, that their 
recruits would be reexamined at the general rendezvous before

feing forwarded to the field. By citing these facts no reflection 
is intended upon the honesty and skill with which the great major- 
ity of these officers performed their duties.; yet among the dis- 
charged reciniits were found every variety of physical disqualifica- 
tion ; and some of them exhibited the most culpable carelessness, or 
the most stupid fi^-aud upon the part of the recruitmg officers. And 
the facts are highly significant as showing how necessary for the 
good of the service are the most stringent recruiting regulations, to 
insure sufficient caution on the part of officers in the performance 
of this most important duty. 



The 33d regiment of Ohio Volunteers commenced its organiza- 
tion in the summer of 1861, and started into active ser- Eariy his- 
vice as a minimum regiment about the middle of the ohioregi- 
ensuing October. It was recruited generally from the ™sentin"t]£ 
rural districts of Southern Ohio, and was composed of new^regu 
medium-sized men, the nervous temperament predomi- aiTy . ** ^^"^^"^ 
nating. The medical examination of the men consisted of but little 
more than opening and shutting the hands, bending the elbows 
and knees, and rotating the shoulder-joint, with a casual glance at 
the teeth and eyes, and a question as to age and previous general 
health. They were then, with few exceptions, mustered in to the 
service. The only regular officer in the regiment was the Colonel 
(Brig.-Gen. J. W. Sill, killed at Stone River). It was rendez- 
voused near Portsmouth, upon the Ohio River, in a miasmatic lo- 
cality. The camp was supplied with water freely impregnated with 
various salts, and was located, not for the salubriousness of the 
region, but for geographical convenience. Intermittent fever and 
diarrhoea made their appearance to a considerable extent in the 
regiment before leaving camp, and the men generally were not in 
a good hygienic condition, on account of the malarious poisoning. 
Its first service was in Eastern Kentucky, under General Nelson, 
and it was accompanied by the 2d, 21st, and 59th regiments Ohio 
Volunteers, and several detachments of Kentucky troops. The 
campaign w^as a severe one, on account of rainy weather and hard 
marches through a mountainous region. Thirty or thirty-five of 
the brigade w^ere wounded in a skirmish, and a large number of all 
the regiments fell sick with charrhoea and measles. During this 
short campaign, each regiment conducted its medical affairs inde- 
pendently. We had sufficient medical stores for years, but few of 
other necessaries for our sick. We lacked hospital tents, ambu-

lances, etc. On our return, bj way of the Big Sandy and the 
Ohio rivers, we were ordered to Louisville, Ky., and were en- 
camped in a low marshy place, that was knoM^i long afterward as 
" Mud Camp." We remained here only a short time, and were 
ordered to Bacon Creek, in supporting distance of the troops at 
Mumfordville, on Green River, where we remained until the 10th 
of February, 1862.

At the same time sickness continued on the increase. Large 
Increase of numbers wcro attacked with measles, mumps, small-pox, 
sickness. asthcuic diarrhoea, camp fever, etc. In my own regi- 
ment, I had nearly three hundred cases of measles alone, and, on 
account of all forms of disease, it was reduced to a mere camp- 
guard. The sick reports in the Surgeon-General's Office, from 
Bacon Creek, Camp Nevin, and Green River, and from the numer- 
ous and overcrowded hospitals at Louisville, testify to the ravage 
of disease at this time, and to its exhausting effects upon the army. 
According to my observation among the regiments composing our 
(Mitchell's) Division, those that had served during the first three 
months of the war did not suifer to the same extent from sickness 
as those that were recruited in the late summer and fall months ; 
and from this fact I deduce the opinion that all new levies of 
troops should be made in the spring-time of the year. 



AVe soon discovered, from the large per cent, of mortality that 
Superiority attended the cases sent to general hospital, that they 
pitais. would have recovered better in camp ; and accordingly, 

we secured all the tents that we could, and sent no more sick 
away, unless compelled to do so for want of room. I have never 
since seen cause to change my decided preference for canvas for 
hospital purposes. 

When the order came for marching upon Nashville, a striking 
Effect of improvement in the health of the troops took place. The 
d!Jron°the' signal for breaking camp seemed like electricity to revive 
troops. into activity energy long dormant, and I take it as a fact

ill Qstra ting the beneficial effect of ideas and new mental impres- 
sions upon health. That the long repose of a large army in camp 
is unfavorable to its health, notwithstanding the best hygienic reg- 
ulations, is a fact too frequently observed throughout the war to 
require argument. 

Another circumstance occurred about this time which bears upon 
the size of men who can best endure the vicissitudes of size of men 
army life. It occurred with the 10th regiment Wisconsin for service. 
Volunteers. When this regiment joined us on the march to Bacon 
Creek, it was full to the maximum, w:ith generally very tall and 
athletic men. It was a splendid looking regiment, and maintained 
its size quite well while we remained in camp, but the march that 
proved a stimulant to the health of my own regiment had the oppo- 
site effect upon it ; its largest men fell out of ranks by platoons, 
and I believe that it never did recover its proportionate strength, 
as compared with other regiments where the size of the men was 
not above medium. 

Line of March of Troops from Nasliville. 
When the main army left Nashville and moved on to Pittsburg 
Landing, our division marched on Huntsville. In the mean time 
I was commissioned into the general staff, and received orders to 
report to General Halleck, in the field, before Corinth ; but not 
until after I had, under the direction of the division medical di- 
rector, opened the Huntsville General Hospital. 



The battle of Pittsburg Landing, or Shiloh, will be recorded in 
the history of this war as one of its most terrible scenes. Battle of 
I saw nothing of this battle save the scarred trees, the Landing'!^ 
shallow graves, and numerous little mounds bursted with the bloat- 
ing carcases of slightly buried horses. As I rode from the river 
to the front over the field, I smelled the dull, heavy odors of the 
old camp and of the march. The sun was hot, and the paludal 
water, which was the sole dependence of the troops, rested in pud- 
dles or shallow ditches, equally common to beast and man, and I 
felt that disease and death must be holding high carnival in such 
an atmosphere and place as that. This I found to be true. We 
heard much of the battle that had been fought, and as we reflected 
upon the tales told us of the suffering and slow rehef on the battle- 
field, we thought surely "some one had blundered!" A grave

fault existed somewhere ; and although I knew that the medical 
department of the army did not at that time hold the high place in 
the consideration of the commanding generals that it should have 
done, yet I am of the belief that the chief medical officers present 
did not comprehend the full extent of the preparation required for 
a large battle, so as to have properly prepared for it. There had 
been no organization of the medical department, especially for the 
field of battle ; and the natural result is w^hat is shown to have oc- 
curred, namely, confusion amongst the medical officers, slow relief 
to the wounded, unjustifiable operations, and a lack of supplies. 
The news of the battle went to the North, and the boats that 
brought supphes carried ofi" the wounded. No attempt was made 
to treat the severely wounded men near the field, where rest could 
be maintained, which is so essential to the cure of such cases ; but 
all were sent North, and the sufferer had not the alternative of 
choosing between transportation North and death, and remaining 
upon the field wdth a reasonable chance of recovery, even though 
it were under the rudest shelter that the bedding found would 
have afibrded. 

As I have intimated above, during the first two years of the w^ar, 
Want of CO- thcrc did not exist that harmony between the generals 
tScOTi-*^ commanding and their staff* medical officers necessary to 
™cersTnd*' tlic efficiency of our department. Whether it was be- 
geons. cause medical officers unwisely coupled to the proper 

claims of their department authority that did not belong to it, and 
thereby themselves provoked an opposition deleterious to its inter- 
ests ; or whether it was owing to an arbitrary disposition wdth offi- 
cers commanding to regulate every staff department according to 
their own ideas of what was necessary, the fact w^as, there existed 
a want of harmony, if not open antagonism. In justice to the gen- 
erals upon whose staff I have served, I must say that it was my 
good fortune never to find any difficulty in obtaining their hearty 
cooperation in carrying out any measures that I deemed important 
to the health, comfort, and proper care of the soldier. 



Profiting by the dear-bought experience of Shiloh, and in antici- 
First general patiou of a scvcrc battle at Corinth, orders were given, 
ofthis°fSiy. about the time that I arrived there, to establish large 
field hospitals in the rear of each of the armies. It w^as not de- 
signed to send to the rear any w^ounded whose lives or limbs would

have been seriously endangered by the transportation. The hos- 
pital for Biiell's army, which was placed under the charge of Sur- 
geon A. P. Meglert, U. S. V., and myself, was intended to accom- 
modate 2500 patients. Elaborate drawings of this hospital, and a 
description of its construction and administration, were afterwards 
forwarded to the Surgeon-General of the army. The plan was in 
general terms as follows : It consisted of sections, each section 
complete in its own administration, with one senior medical officer, 
two assistants, and the necessary attendants, and made to contain 
about one hundred and twenty-five patients. Each section con- 
sisted of four wards, arranged two on either side of an avenue, or 
space, in which were located the quarters of its medical officers and 
attendants. These sections were repeated in a line with each 
other. The kitchens and very narrow and deep latrines were 
located on one flank, while on the other were located the quarters 
of the chief medical officers, purveyor, commissary, and the guards. 
In the absence of hospital tents, the wards were made of tarpau- 
lins, stretched over a frame-work consisting of comer-posts and studs 
driven into the ground, and plates and rafters. The tarpaulins 
formed the roof, and old tent-flies were used for curtains to the 
sides. I like this form of shelter much better for the summer than 
the regular hospital tent. A good substitute for the tarpaulin in 
this kind of tents, especially when it is necessary to economize 
canvas, is to use hospital tent-flies for the purpose. They can be 
arranged by tacking the side border of a fly upon the ridge-pole of 
the frame-work ; then drawing it tight over the plate, and fastening 
the other side-border, by means of its cords, to stakes driven firmly 
into the ground ; then tack another fly upon the opposite side in a 
similar manner, and so on with four more flies, and you will have 
a large and commodious tent, cool in the summer and easily venti- 
lated. 

But the enemy retreated from Corinth without a battle, and 
when our armies moved on, these large field-hospitals severe ser- 
were filled with sick and such men as were too feeble ^am^ment 
to march. No better opportunity could have been before co"^ 
aflbrded than this for a study of the diseases prevalent ^''*^- 
in the army at that time. It will be remembered by all who 
served in the trenches before Corinth, that durinsj the whole time 
they were constantly on duty, either digging in the trenches or 
watching on the picket-line, and that their rations consisted of but 
little more than salt pork and hard bread, or flour, with no means 
of preparing it. They will remember how grateftd they felt for

any little article of fiiiit or vegetable food that the Sanitary Com- 
mission were enabled to supply. How could one wonder, then, at 
the spectral appearance of this army as it marched off ! 



The following " Observations on Camp Disease in the Field, near 
Typeofdis- Ooriuth, Miss.," made at the time by myself, and pub- 
a?^y before lishcd iu the " American Medical Monthly," will give a 
Corinth. £^jj, ^^^^ ^£ ^^^ ^j^q q£ discasc that prevailed there : — 

" In 'our hospital alone there were registered seventeen hundred 
patients. All of these cases presented the same type of disease, 
variously expressed by the terms ' Dysentery,' ' Diarrhoea,' ' Febris 
Typhoides,' ' Scorbutus,' and ' Debilitas.' Subsequent observation 
of these cases demonstrated the uncertain character of this classi- 
fication, and that the disease derived its name fi'om the most 
prominent symptoms present, rather than from ascertained path- 
ological conditions. It could not easily have been otherwise, as 
aU surgeons will testify who have found the same person, in the 
course of a few weeks, upon their register, under treatment for 
dysentery, diarrhoea, and febris typhoides ; the same attack ac- 
quiring a new name, in accordance with the development of new 
symptoms, or the absence of others. In fact, these diseases ex- 
hibited such a diversity in their behavior, seldom running a reg- 
ular course, but alternating one with the other, and exhibiting so 
many symptoms in common, that the nomenclature was necessarily 
confused. 

" The case was termed ' dysentery ' or ' diarrhoea,' in accordance 
with the presence or absence of tormina, tenesmus, and bloody 
evacuations. But there was seldom an amount of local pain and 
constitutional disturbance in the cases exhibiting bloody evacuations 
sufficient to indicate the presence of active inflammation ; and ul- 
cerations in the colon, and bloody dejections, frequently occurred, 
unattended by tormina and tenesmus, and seemed to be more the 
result of a hasmorrhagic diathesis than of any perceptible organic 
change. In all the autopsies made, the large intestine was free 
from ulcerations, but the mucous membrane of the ileum invariably 
exhibited a softened condition, and was easily removed with the 
back of the scalpel. This condition also existed in the colon occa- 
sionally. In no case were there discovered well-defined ulcerations. 
In a few instances the mucous coat was found absent in patches, 
but the appearances denoted an abrasion rather than the result of 
an ulcerative process. 



TYPE OF DISEASE IN THE ARMY BEFORE CORINTH. 51 

" In cases of fever, the fever present was decidedly of the ady- 
namic type, and was usually registered as ' febris typhoides.' But 
this fever differed essentially from the true typhoid or enteric 
fever in several particulars. There was no tympanites, no rose- 
colored einiption, and no affection of the Peyerian and solitary 
glands of the ileum. The visceral complications were trifling. In 
no case was any disposition to a disorganization of the parenchym- 
atous organs observed. There was a great tendency to serous 
effusion, especially in the pericardium. The brain appeared 
healthy. Death seemed to result from asthenia. Parotid abscesses 
were frequently developed in the course of the fever. They 
usually appeared in a late stage; but when they appeared ear- 
lier in the fever, the system failed rapidly, and death ensued in a 
majority of cases, though not in all. When life was prolonged, 
the entire gland suppurated, leaving the whole parotid region 
cavernous. 

" ' Scorbutus ' was applied to cases in which more of the distinct- 
ive marks of scurvy were present, such as spongy gums, large and 
flabby tongue, feeble pulse, dusky complexion, and petechise. This 
disease very seldom appeared in its worst and most characteristic 
forms. 

" ' Dehilitas,^ as used, was a very general term. Sometimes it 
indicated convalescence ; sometimes it was applied to the merely 
adynamic condition of the system that resulted from the continued 
operation of the depressing influence of the past severe winter and 
spring campaign. In these cases there was no fever, and but 
httle, if any, diarrhoea, but simply a ' weakness,' attended with 
emaciation and a loathing of the army ration. Occasionally, cases 
terminated fatally very suddenly where no cause post mortem could 
be discovered, save fibrinous coagula in the cavity of the heart. 

" These coagula were observed in 33 per cent, of the autopsies 
nade, and in nearly all the cases of sudden death. They were 
firm, unmixed with red blood corpuscles, and weighed from one 
and a half to seven drachms. They were found oftener in the right 
ventricle ; usually, however, in both ventricles ; generally attached 
to the chordae tendineae, but sometimes entirely loose. The largest 
coagulum discovered was in the case of a patient who was admitted 
on the 28th day of May, 1862, with ' febris typhoides.' At the 
end of twelve days his symptoms of fever were entirely relieved, 
and he bid fair for a speedy recovery. He remained in this con- 
dition, without apparent disease, nourished and stimulated with care, 
until death came like a gentle sleep on the 22d day of June. The

heart was found in all cases pale and flabby, and the blood was 
very fluid. The gall-bladder was usually found full of dark- 
colored bile. In several instances it was very much distended ; 
but there were no icteroid symptoms before death, nor any appar- 
ent deficiency of bile in the evacuations from the bowels. 

" Several instances of intussusception were discovered ; in one 
of which there were six invaginations of the intestine, ranging 
from one inch to four inches in extent. Yet the foeces had been 
passed regularly, without any symptoms of obstruction. 

" The deductions from the foregoing observations are, that the 
causes of all these affections were in the totality of their effects 
essentially debilitating, and, in the main, may be enumerated : as 
the long-continued exposure to cold and wet during the "s™ter and 
spring, the hot sun and cold nights of the later months, excessive 
labor and loss of ' rest, deficiency of food and bad water ; that, 
possessing so many elements of similarity, these affections owed 
their variety to some accidental circumstance in the constitution of 
the individual; and that no certain classification of these could 
have been made having for its basis the presence or absence of 
pathological lesions that could be determined before death. It 
would seem that the combined operations of all these causes gen- 
erated a general morbid condition, or dyscrasia, which constituted 
the true disease ; and that the pathological phenomena that resulted 
therefrom were but secondary effects, and that these effects or 
' diseases ' compensated each other when attacking different indi- 
viduals, and alternated very often in the course of the same case. 
Our main reliance in treatment was in rest and nutrition." 

Along with the sick above referred to, we received a hundred 
cases of severe wounds, amputations, etc. Erysipelas appeared in 
almost every case to a greater or less extent, but gangrene in none. 



March of the As I havc already remarked, the army that moved out 
Ohio after of the trcnchcs in pursuit of Beauregard was but the 
tionofCor- spcctrc of au army. The men and officers looked sal- 
improved low and thin, and considered themselves fortunate if they

After pursuing Beauregard for a short distance into Mississippi, 
the army of the Ohio (Buell's army) took up its march eastward 
to Middle Tennessee, and continued marching almost without in- 
termission for nearly five months ; traversing Northern Mississippi 
and Alabama up into the mountains bounding Middle Tennessee on

le west ; thence northward through Kentucky to Louisville ; 
thence retm-ning in pursuit of Bragg, fighting the battle of Perry- 
ville, on the way back to Nashville, where we finally went into 
camp and indulged in a short rest before fighting the battle of 
Stone River. The health of the army began to improve the mo- 
ment it got into the region of pure water, vegetables, and iruits. 
Rations of green com did more for the cure of the obstinate diar- 
rhoea that then prevailed than any or all the theraupeutical meas- 
ures that had been tried ! 

When the army arrived at Louisville it was re enforced by re- 
cruits who came forth in answer to the calls of July, Reenforce- 
1862. The personnel of this enhstment was scarcely any ™myfrom* 
improvement over the former one. New organizations S62Tnoim. 
were formed, and were officered by inexperienced men. fnXT«"- 
The government surely committed a great error at this theTroopf 
time in not filling up the old regiments before creating °^ ■^^^^• 
new ones. The new recruit would then have been subjected to 
the inspection of regimental officers already experienced, and 
would have soon acquired the habits of personal care and comfort 
that association with drilled and disciplined soldiers alone can 
teach. But as it was, in a short time these new regiments were 
reduced in strength below those that were then serving out their 
second year. On the march from Louisville large numbers fell 
fi-om the ranks. They had not the encouragement and friendly 
aid of the old soldier at their side to teach them the folly of carry- 
ing a heavy knapsack, or to carry their gun for a while, and to re- 
lieve them of fatigue duty on going into camp at night ; but, ex- 
hausted and sick, they fell out of line, overloaded the ambulances, 
and over-peopled every town through which we passed. 

But to return to the field hospital at Corinth. After the sick 
and wounded left behind by the army had been sent North, we 
were ordered by Surgeon Murray, U. S. A. Medical Director, to 
bring the tents, etc., to Huntsville, with the view of establishing a 
similar hospital there, but this intention was not fully carried into 
effect on account of the retreat of the army into Kentucky. 

In the mean time I was assigned to duty as medical director of 
the 6th (Wood's) Division.

an engagement with the enemy, who marched in a par- First attempt

medical de- point or points in view. At this time (Sept. 10, 1862) I 
foTthe field made the first attempt that was made, to my knowledge, 
wood?D?- toward an efficient organization of the medical department 
vision. £^^j, ^YiQ field of battle. I do not know what may have 

been done in other divisions of the army, and am not disposed to 
take any especial credit for exclusive originality in the conception, 
as it appears from Circular No. 4, Surgeon-General's Office, of date 
March 25th, 1863, that a circular was published by the medical di- 
rector of the army of the Potomac on this subject the 30th of the 
following October. The plan that I inaugurated was as follows : I 
directed that when a battle was imminent the chief surgeon of each 
brigade of my division should report to me immediately for special 
orders, and to assist in the selection of a site for the division hos- 
pital. They were directed to have one regimental medical officer 
to accompany each regiment upon the field, for giving temporary 
aid, and to see that the wounded were removed promptly. The 
remainder of the medical officers were to be held in readiness to 
rendezvous with their hospital wagons at the point designated for 
the division hospital. The brigade surgeons were to constitute an 
operating board, without whose sanction no important operation 
was to be performed. We had no regular ambulance organization. 
The season was unfavorable to military movements, and no great 
Theiongrest danger was felt that the enemy would attack us. The 
Th?time°^^" mi^ds of the troops were therefore at rest from the con- 
cuperaSng' staut cxpcctation of orders to march, or apprehensions

reenforced by the return of men to duty from general hos- 
pitals, and by new enlistments ; and on the other hand great num- 
bers of physically disabled men were discharged from the service 
who had rested as a dead weight on all of its movements. 

The first real and successful attempt toward a thorough organ- 
ization of the medical department of the entire army commenced 
here under the directions of Surgeon G. Perin, U. S. A. Many 
practical observations had been made by those medical officers who 
had labored in the field for a period of eighteen months or two 
years in all the capacities of regimental surgeon, surgeon-in-charge 
of field hospitals, and medical director ; — in the camp, on the 
march, and in battle ; and the new medical director of the depart- 
ment wisely availed himself of the experience and suggestions of 
his subordinates, and took them into his counsel. Under his care 
and direction the army grew in strength like a convalescent, from 
day to day. 



CHAKGE IN METHOD OF COOKING. " 55 

If either of the grand armies was ftirther advanced in the com- 
pleteness of their medical organization than ours was at this time, 
we would claim in qualification that no other army had done an 
equal amount of hard and continued service. No other army had 
less time and opportmiity than ours to inaugurate and carry out 
reforms. We had long since ceased to look to our common senior 
for instructions, and any thing of excellence that existed in our 
administration sprung from our own unaided efforts. We strug- 
gled without enlightenment from the chief of our bureau, and against 
the prejudices of a commanding general who felt that every sol- 
dier detailed from the ranks for the care of the sick and disabled 
was a permanent loss to his effective force, and that the medical 
department should be self-sustaining — that the sick should take 
care of the sick ! Without wishing to dispute his high position 
among scientific mihtary generals, the commander of the army 
of the Ohio exhibited in his conduct a great deficiency of sympa- 
thy for the sick and disabled soldier, and treated the efforts of the 
medical department to improve itself with an amount of indiffer- 
ence that showed that he merely tolerated its existence as an un- 
pleasant necessity. 

A different condition of things commenced when General Rosen- 
crans took command of the army. He and his medical director 
harmonized in friendship and benevolence of feeling, so that every 
practicable measure recommended to improve the efficiency of the 
medical department, and to raise the standard of qualification of 
its officers, met with his hearty cooperation. Soon after the battle 
of Stone River an Army Board of Medical Examiners was ap- 
pointed for the examination of medical officers reported incompe- 
tent, of assistant surgeons for promotion, and of private physicians 
applying for contract. I regret to have it to say that we had some 
medical officers who were found to be grossly incompetent. The 
effect of these examinations was very apparent in the improvement 
of the efficiency of the medical staff. 

The hygienic condition of the army was greatly improved here 
by a change in the method of cooking, which was enforced hy 
orders^ namely, by companies. Heretofore the cooking had been 
done by squads or messes, notwithstanding the oft-repeated recom- 
mendation of medical directors in favor of cooking by companies. 
To insure a good quality of soup for the soldier an order contain- 
ing a set of most excellent soup receipts was issued on the recom- 
mendation of the medical director of the department : — 



^Q SOUP-ORDER. 

GENERAL ORDER No. 76. 

Head-quakters Deft, of the Cumberland, 
Murfreesboi'o, Tenn., April 10th, 1863. 

To preserve as far as possible the health of the troops of this 
Army, the following remilations, in regard to diet, are 

Soup-order. mi o o o 

prescribed : — 

I. When in camp, cooking will be done by companies, instead 
of squads. 

II. Soup, made according to the following recipes, will be served 
to the men as follows : — 

1st. Beef soup, when fresh beef can be procured, twice a week. 
2d. Soup made from beans or pease, twice a week, or oftener, if 
desired by the men. 

RECIPE FOR BEEF SOUP. 

Beef and Vegetable Soup for fifty men. 

Ingredients, — Beef (cut in pieces of 4 or 5 lbs. each) 35 lbs. 

Dessicated Vegetables ... 3 " 

Rice 4 " 

Flour, sugar, and salt, each . . | " 

Pepper ^ oz. 

Water . . . . . . 8 galls. 

Directions. — Soak the dessicated vegetables from reveille until 
after breakfast. Immediately after breakfast, put all the mgre- 
dients into kettles at once, except the flour ; set them over the 
fire, and when beginning to boil diminish the heat, and simmer 
gently until 11 o'clock ; then add to the soup the flour, which has 
been first mixed with enough water to form a thin batter ; mix well 
together and boil until noon. Suflicient hot water may be added, 
from time to time, to replace that lost by boiling. The soup should 
be stirred occasionally, to prevent burning or sticking to the sides 
of the kettle. 

Note. — To make good beef soup, it must be borne in mind that 
the ingredients are put into cold water, and the heat gradually ap- 
plied until nearly the boiling point ; then simmer for several hours. 
By brisk boiling the exterior of the meat is hardened, and its juices 
will not be mixed with the water, but retained. The meat will 
also be tough and unpalatable. The dessicated vegetables should 
be well separated when put in water to soak.

Ingredients. 



Directions. — Soak the beans over night ; at reveille in the 
morning, put them into vessels, carefully cleaned, and boil steadily 
until done ; then mash them with a spoon, or masher made for the 
pui'pose, and strain through a colander if practicable. 

Immediately after breakfast, put the bacon (or pork), cut in 
pieces of from three to five pounds each, into another kettle with 
water, and boil for an hour ; pour off the water, add the bacon to 
the soup, with onions (chopped fine) and pepper, and boil until 
noon. Remove the bacon and cut into smaller pieces, suitable for 
serving with the soup. 

Note. — In the preparation of this soup, soft or rain water 
should be used, when practicable ; and if a less quantity than that 
directed be put into the vessel, or if it become necessary, from 
long boiling, to add more, it should be boiling and not cold water. 
The bacon, after parboiling, can be placed near the fire if the 
beans are not sufficiently soft to mash well. The reason for direct- 
ing that the bacon be added after the beans are done is, that grease 
of any kind hardens them. 

When pease are issued in lieu of beans, they should be treated 
in the same manner. 

III. All commanding officers are charged to see that these or- 
ders are strictly enforced, and that there may be no neghgence on 
the part of company cooks. Company officers will inspect the 
cooking every day, to see that it is properly done. 

IV. The especial attention of the officers of the Inspector-Gen- 
eral's Department will be given to this matter, and they are di- 
rected to report the execution or neglect of these orders, by every 
regiment in the Department, in their semi-monthly Inspection 
Reports. 

V. The senior medical officer on duty with each regiment \vill 
make a "written report, on Monday of each week, to the Medical 
Director of the Department, tlirough the intermediate medical 
officers, stating the number of times soup has been served to the 
men during the week, the kind, and the quality of the cooking. 



58 CAMP POLICE. 

The importance of wholesome food cannot be over-estimated, 
and the General Commanding enjoins upon the commanding officer 
of every regiment the necessity of enforcing these orders. Im- 
proper and badly cooked food, eaten at unseasonable hours, is the 
cause of much of the sickness which thins our ranks and fills our 
hospitals. 

By command of 

MAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, 

C. GODDARD, A. A. Gr. 

There appeared but very few cases of scurvy here, applying this 
name to cases in which wer-e present the diagnostic symp- 
toms usually given for it ; yet a dyscrasia evidently existed 
with the troops, as many cases of death occurred, some of them sud- 
den, in which a similar post-mortem condition was discovered to that 
described as having existed at Corinth. For the period of many 
months the men had received no fresh vegetables regularly through 
the commissariat ; though the necessity and importance of the 
issue had been very frequently reported to the head-quarters of 
the army. Relief finally came, not through the commissary, but 
through the agency of the Sanitary Commission, to whom General 
Rosecrans gave unlimited orders for transportation for this purpose. 
It seemed that the U. S. Sanitary Commission could succeed in 
furnishing potatoes, etc., where the commissary could not. This 
has been accounted for by the fact that the government let con- 
tracts for their supply in such large amounts, that no one dared to 
undertake to fill them properly, whilst the Sanitary Commission 
purchased in lots of any size, and forwarded them to the field im- 
mediately. 

A few cases of Cerehro-Spinal Meningitis occurred here, though it 
Cerebro-spi- did uot prevail as an epidemic. I cannot give the treat-

their influence to the soldier in the care of his person and accoutre-

camps became models of neatness and order, and received the most 
flattering encomiums from the U. S. Army medical inspectors who 
visited us. The latrines and kitchen sinks were constructed very

[generally upon the same plan ; by digging pits, corresponding in 
[size to the purpose, being larger for the former, and smaller for the 
flatter ; then covering them over with platforms made of clapboards, 
excepting a place small enough merely to give a sure support to 
a half-barrel or cracker box, in the top of which was made a hole 
for the convenience, as the case might be, of a seat, or of pouring 
in slops. Any day the most fastidious person might have gone 
through the encampment of the 21st Army Corps without per- 
ceiving an unpleasant odor. These measures of personal and camp 
police, including the improved method of cooking, had a remark- 
ably good effect upon the health of the soldiers, which was demon- 
strated by their subsequent endurance of fatigue and wounds. 

The subject of an ambulance organization also engaged our at- 
tention here. Up to this time no regular ambulance sys- Ambulance 
tem existed in this army. Regiments were unequally organization, 
supplied with ambulances, and as regimental quartermasters were 
responsible for them, their use was by no means restricted to legiti- 
mate purposes, and were not usually kept in serviceable condition. 
For instance, in a report made by myself on the subject, Dec. 7th, 
1862, out of one hundred and one (101) ambulances reported in 
my corps, only thirty-nine (39) were reported as serviceable ; and 
it was with this number that we transported our wounded from 
the battle-field ! The division quartermasters reported that they 
had made frequent demands for ambulances ever since the army 
left Louisville, the preceding August, but failed to get any. On 
recommendation of the Medical Director, an " Ambulance Order " 
was issued, March 6th, 1863, which, in the hands of the medical 
directors proved very efficient during the long march to Chatta- 
nooga, and in the battles of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, and 
Mission Ridge. 

Thus was the army of the Cumberland, on the 20th of June, 
when it broke camp, to commence the summer march March of the 
of 1863, that led to the battle-field of Chickamauga. Chattanooga. 
The 14th Corps had a short engagement with the enemy before 
reaching Tullahoma, but my own corps being a few miles distant, 
I knew nothing of this engagement that would be of interest in 
this history. 

During the march to Chattanooga there was nothing occurred 
worth recording beyond the incidents common to a continuous 
march of weeks, and the occasional rests that intervened. The 
hygienic condition continued good ; all the conditions were favor- 
able. The season summer ; the country mountainous and abound-

ing in springs and running streams of pure water; the marches 
easy; and suppHes of blackberries, peaches, and green com in 
abundance. But few fell sick on the way. Chattanooga was 
evacuated on our approach. We here found a large number of 
pavilions that had been used by the rebels for hospitals, which we 
immediately prepared for our own use. They were well arranged 
for the pur2)ose, but were not nearly as elaborate in all their appoint- 
ments as our own general hospitals. One striking feature of their 
general arrangement was, having a large receiving hospital near by 
the principal railroad depot, where the sick and disabled could be 
received at all hours, and not have to suffer ambulance transporta- 
tion before being fed and dressed. 

Our army remained in Chattanooga, in this state of siege, for a pe- 
siege of riod of five weeks. Owing to the fall rains the roads soon 
nooga. became almost impassable. The troops were regularly on 

half rations, and sometimes failed to get any for a day at a time. 
Sometimes, in lieu of rations, they were favored, over the horses, 
with a few small ears of corn, which they parched and ate with a 
rehsh. 

Soon all the forest trees within the works, and as far beyond 
as it was safe to venture, were felled and used for firewood ; and 
when this supply was exhausted, the stumps thereof disappeared 
for the same purpose ; and w^hen these failed, the roots and rootlets 
of the trees were dug from the ground, and husbanded with care. 
There had been no issue of clothing made since in the summer. 
The men had left their knapsacks and overcoats at Murfreesboro, 
according to orders, and now were protected only by their thread- 
bare and tattered summer clothes ; none had overcoats, and but 
a portion had blankets. 

The transportation of the army had become fearfully reduced. 
For want of forage many of the officers were compelled to turn 
their horses out to roam at large, and perhaps die, or else see them 
starved to death at the picket-stake. Thousands of mules died 
from starvation. The road to Bridgeport was corduroyed with 
their carcasses. In every mud-hole they might have been seen 
struggling with feeble and fast-waning strength in fruitless eiforts 
to extricate themselves. Whole wagons became worthless under 
their ravenous attack. They died in such numbers in the encamp- 
ment that the hving scarcely sufficed to drag their dead away. 
All the ambulance-horses that could be spared, and almost all the 
artillery-horses, were sent away to the rear. Finally the situation 
demanded, as the only hope of our army, that we should fight 



BATTLE OF MISSION RIDGE. 61 

again. And although no very apparent increase of sickness had 
been produced by the destitution of food and clothing, yet it may 
be readily conceived with what forebodings for our wounded we 
contemplated the necessity for another battle. We knew that 
their hygienic state must be unfavorable to recovery from wounds, 
and the means at our control were almost totally inadequate for 
their prpper care and subsistence. When the enemy evacuated 
the place, they cleared the hospitals of every thing that could be of 
use to us, even to household utensils. Not a bunk was left in the 
buildings used for hospitals. Truly, " we were compelled to make 
brick without straw." A part of the pa\dlions that the enemy had 
used for hospitals came Avithin the range of the guns, when our 
defensive lines around the city were established, and were de- 
stroyed by fire ; and for hospital purposes we were driven to the 
necessity of using hotels, churches, and deep and badly ventilated 
warehouses, the walls of which had become so many square yards of 
fomites^ in consequence of the poisonous emanations from the large 
number of Confederate sick and wounded who were treated here. 
For bedsteads, we manufactured bunks from fencing-boards and the 
sidings of old frame houses, which were careftilly removed that the 
nails might be saved for special purposes. A few bales of cotton 
frirnished us material for mattresses, and for cooking purposes we 
gathered odd pieces of cooking utensils and broken ranges which, 
at any other time, would have been considered worthless, but 
which to us now were invaluable. 

The battles of Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge were 
fought on Nov. 23d, 24th, and 25th, 1863, and opened up Battles of 
the old line of communications to Bridgeport. Our fore- RWge and 
bodings for the sufferers in these battles were too w^ell Mountain, 
verified. Under the best nursing and treatment that we were 
enabled to give them, the mortality was very considerable. Na- 
ture seemed to arouse all her enero-ies in one effort to cure ; but 
hospital gangrene and its congeners bliglited with their poisonous 
venom her laudable efforts, and again we were compelled to stand 
by and see case after case that had excited our most lively interest 
falter in the reparative processes and perish. We lived in con- 
stant fear and trembling for our most promising cases ; not until 
the last particle of pus had ceased, and the cuticular epithelium had 
interposed itself as a final protection, pronouncing the amputation 
or wound healed, did we rest secure in our triumph with nature's 
remedial forces. Too often, at night, we left our " good fellow " 
with promises that he should soon go home to his friends, and in

the morning met the nurse with the deportment so ominous of evil 
tidings, and with the report that our patient " had had a chill ; " 
and, on inspection, found, instead of laudable pus, a sanious dis- 
charge upon the dressings, with perhaps gas bubbles issuing from 
the wound, and granulations of a hue of greenish gray. Our pa- 
tient would then be singularly unconscious of any danger, taking 
his quinine as if he had only a chill, and, loth to see inevitable death 
in the case, for a few hours, or a day perhaps, we, too, hoped it 
would prove " only a chill." But it was well for him that, as he must 
die, his death came from a simultaneous poisoning of his system 
with his wound, rather than from the slow exhaustion of gangrene 
and repeated secondary hemorrhages. 

The behavior of all classes of wounds was very much modified 
by the character of the buildings or shelter in which they were 
treated. It was best in tents, next in pavilions or modern build- 
ings, and least well in the brick buildings. A row of deep ware- 
houses was used for our purposes, a part of which were constructed 
of brick, and a part of wood, and it was observed by all who went 
from ward to ward that there was a decided improvement in the 
appearance of the patients in the wooden over those in the brick 
portion of the buildings. 

Immediately after the battle of Mission Ridge, two divisions 
March to the of the 4th Corps marclicd to the relief of Knoxville, and 
Kuoxviiie. remained in that vicinity until the army was concentrated 
health not- for thc Spring campaign. It is a fact worthy of note that

of supplies, the very shortest rations, and were still almost naked in 
the midst of winter, and without tents, yet their health was un- 
precedented, many of the regiments not reporting a single case of 
sickness on their monthly reports of sick and wounded ; while the 
remaining division that was in camp near Chattanooga, which was 
much more liberally supplied, was constantly reporting quite a 
large sick list, and the appearance of scorbutic indications. Short 
rations alone do not cause bad health so much as a more abun- 
dant ration less careftilly prepared, and, usually, the more abundant 
the ration, the less carefrilly it is prepared for food.

^B were abolished, and a system of brigade hospitals was established, 
equipped in accordance with the following allowance, namely : one 
wall tent, one common tent, and hospital tents in the proportion of 
one for every 350 men present ; camp kettles, etc., as many as are 
absolutely necessary; and one medicine wagon and two army 
wagons for transporting medical stores and camp and garrison 
equipage for the brigade hospital — all of which were to be under 
the direction and charge of the brigade surgeon. A field supply- 
table was determined upon, and published for the guidance of 
medical officers in a circular dated "Head-quarters, Department 
of the Cumberland, January 1st, 1864," specifying the allowance 
for a brigade. This obviated the necessity of continuing the trains 
of corps reserve supplies which had proved so advantageous in pre- 
vious campaigns. 

The ambulance corps was more thoroughly organized, in accord- 
ance with General Orders No. 2, Head-quarters, Department of 
the Cumberland, January 2d, 1864.

1 The endurance and health of the soldier are obviously affected, favorably or unfavor- 
ably, to a greater or less extent, by alimentation; inadequate nutritious supplies must, of 
course, lessen his ability to sustain the hardships of army life, and impair the power of 
resisting disease. The regulation of army rations, so as to secure to each soldier a proper 
relative proportion of the different alimentar}' principles, avoiding, on the one hand, defi- 
ciency, and on the other hand, excess, and the preparation of food with regard alike to 
wholesomeness, convenience, and economy, are objects of the greatest importance with a 
view to promote the largest amount of efficienc}', and to afford the fullest protection 
against morbific causes other than those which are directly or exclusively dietetic. Army 
alimentation, therefore, belongs properly among the topics embraced in section first of this 
volume ; and, in consideration of its importance, a distinct chapter is devoted to it. The 
next chapter contains testimony of medical officers respecting certain points connected with 
alimentation. Dietetic causes, standing in direct relation to the production of certain indi- 
vidual diseases, especially scurvy, diarrhoea, and dysentery, will enter into the consideration 
of these diseases in section second of this volume. — Editor.

ernment took ample care of its soldiers, and, of course, would do 
so in the then impending crisis. Even in the Mexican War, when 
the element of undisciplined volunteers, under inexperienced offi- 
cers, had been largely introduced, the distance of the field of 
operations was so great, and their results so satisfactory to our 
pride, that little attention was drawn to the disastrous mortahty 
from diseases of assimilation that attended those briUiant campaigns. 
Fortunately for the American people, this self-contented apathy 
was broken by the revelations of the sufferings of the Experience 
British and French armies in the Crimea. The results and French 

. . . IP armies in thfe 

01 parliamentary mvestigations and or newspaper reports Crimea, 
revealed the fact, that, afler an experience of many centuries of 
foreign wars and wars of invasion, the British commissariat was 
totally inefficient. The science of the alimentation of armies had 
been neglected to an extent that involved all the errors of a diet 
which, when abundant, was unsuited to the wants of the system ; 
and which was so often deficient as to produce actual starvation. 
The publicity so sensibly given to these important truths seems to 
have been the direct cause of the inquiries made into the constitu- 
tion of the United States army ration at the outset of the rebellion, 
and the considerable reform, by enlargement and increase of flexi- 
bility, made by Congress in the summer of 1861. 

But notwithstanding this, and without having been subjected to 
such calamities as attended the Crimean War, the armies Faulty au- 
of the United States doubtless endured much that might the armies of 
have been avoided. The ration was sufficient (judi- states, 
ciously issued) in weight of nutriment, except in the more pressing 
exigencies of hard marches and distant bases of supply ; yet it can- 
not be denied that a fault existed, which we may expect to find, — 
1st. In the arrangement or equalization of the different nutri- 
ments ; or, 

2d. In their lack of adaptability to vicissitudes of climate or the 
accidents of campaigns. 

The proof of the existence of the fault asserted needs little argu- 
ment. It is found in the great mortality from diseases of assimi- 
lation which began with the war and increased in fatality up to its 
close ; and in the evil results which attended gunshot injuries and 
operative surgery from the impoverished condition of the blood of 
the sufferers. Thousands of such men were borne from the field, 
apparently hardy and strong, Avho within a few days developed 
some cachexia, seriously comphcating the otherwise simple nature 
of their injuries. In the establishment of the present ration, only

tradition was consulted. So far as is now known, it was arranged 
by men without pretense to skill as experts, and without any 
exhaustive study of the laws of alimentation. 

In the discussion of the food of armies it is not our intention to 
Occasional hsise our argument on those occasional interruptions of 
tKro/sup- s^Ppty which sometimes subjected our troops to the evil 
^^^' of short rations. They were the almost unavoidable 

incidents of a sudden and gigantic war, conducted by inexperi- 
enced officers, and of the magnitude of which only a few foresaw 
enough to urge the needed preparations. These misfortunes, as 
they occurred in camp, in hospital, or on battle-fields, it was the 
work of the Sanitary Commission to relieve. In all wars this sup- 
plementary labor will be necessary. Some agency must exist in 
alliance with, but independent of, the government, which, with an 
easy book-keeping and a broad charity, can be present with help 
in emergencies and remedy the deficiencies of the government and 
the improvidence of the soldiers themselves. 

On the other hand, we have been led to the conviction that, 
The ration throwiug out of vicw thcsc occasioual disturbances of 
pk)ymenra ^upply, and making the broadest allowance for all other 
B^urce of causes of disease in the army, one, and the most fruitful, 
disease. ^£ j^g sourccs is to be fouud in the ration and its unscien- 
tific employment. We reach this conclusion from the almost 
uniform observation of army surgeons, — that veteranship conferred 
no immunity from diseases of assimilation ; that chronic diarrhoea 
and scurvy increased with the term of service ; that the longer a 
soldier had been subjected to the ration (as he got it), the more 
liable was he to develop some form of cachexia when wounded. 
Thus, hospital gangrene was hardly known during the first few 
months of the war, but steadily increased in frequency of occur- 
rence up to its close. 

To insure a proper comprehension of this subject in the pubhc 
Importance T^^^^^ it is neccssary to revert briefly to some of the more 
ofaUmS- obvious of the laws of alimentation; to endeavor to 
^°^- establish some standard of diet, which, in average cir- 

cumstances, shall be sufficient to maintain the body in health ; to 
note the variations in that diet which may be required by way of 
adapting it to the peculiar life of the soldier ; and, finally, in the 
suggestion of any changes, to see that they possess the requisites 
of sufficient cheapness and ease of transportation. Without the 
latter essential the best of rations would be unavailable. It must 
be in some form that can accompany the march of a column, 
without overburdenino; the train or the haversack. 



AVERAGE DIURNAL LOSS AND GAIN IN WEIGHT. 67 



A STANDARD OF ALIMENTATION. 

The average weight of seventeen hundred soldiers of the army 
of the Potomac was 147^ pounds. The average weight Average 
of seven hundred and five French mounted chasseurs soldiers in 
was 142^ pounds. The average weight of twenty-seven mies. 
thousand eight hundred and fifty-three recruits to the British 
army at home, in 1860, was 128 pounds ; and the average weight 
of twelve thousand one hundred and ninety-one British recruits 
for 1861 was 131 pounds. These recruits were all over twenty- 
one years of age. Thus, the average French weight was 5^ 
pounds less than the American, and the average Enghsh weight 
was about 18 pounds less than the American ; a fact brought out 
by investigations made under the direction of the Sanitary Com- 
mission. It is an emphatic contradiction of the prevalent idea 
that the physical manhood of the Americans has deteriorated fi'om 
the European standard. 

Physiologists have fixed upon one hundred and forty pounds as 
the average weight of the human male. Supposing that Average 
to be the weight of a person in perfect health, the diet ^^e^h^nan 
he needs is one that will keep him at that weight by °'*^®' 
equalizing the receipts and disbursements, the food and the waste 
of the system. The gain acquired by the assimilation of food, 
should exactly counterbalance the loss by exertion. Yet there is a 
further consideration. In what material, in muscle, in fat, or in 
bone, shall this one hundred and forty pounds of original capital be 
invested? A soldier's diet must be adapted to a soldier's needs 
and vicissitudes, to his capacity for enduring heat and cold, to long 
marches and heavy burdens. He demands an athletism not called 
for in the ordinary walks of civil life. The diet, therefore, most 
favorable for the counting-room or the shop, is not that required in 
the field. 

Physiological experiment has arrived at a close approximation to 
the average diurnal s^ain and loss in the man of one hun- Average

68 FOODS EITHER NITROGENETIC OR CALORIFACIENT. 

The total daily loss, in a healthy body, will be exactly equal 
to the gain. The rapidity of this interchange is an important ele- 
ment in the argument. It may be augmented by severe exer- 
cise or decreased by idleness ; and there are articles of diet that 
may compensate for a short alloAvance of food by restraining the 
waste of the system. This waste, however, may be largely in- 
creased without impairing the health, provided the food is equalized 
to it. The waste is from interstitial death of organic atoms in the 
system ; and that atomic death depends largely on the activity of ex- 
ercise — the wear and tear to which the system is subjected. And if 
we have other new-born organic atoms ready to fill the places of 
those destroyed, the weight of the body will remain unchanged. 

In the above table we may at once dispense with three fourths 
of the weight of the ingesta named, as not in any army ration. 
Water and oxygen are provided by another Commissary ; but it 
should not be forgotten that they are nevertheless foods, and that 
the official act or neglect that deprives the soldier of any part 
of his six and three tenths pounds of water and oxygen, robs him 
of so much actual food to which he is entitled. Beyond that, it 
remains only to consider what we have called the " organic gain " ; 
the actual food, vegetable and animal, assumed to be necessary to 
the maintenance of the body, under usual conditions, in a station- 
ary condition of serviceability. 

CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. 
The division of foods into vegetable and animal is unsatisfactory, 
Foods either insomuch as it docs uot spccify, except very roughly, the 
S*caforifa-° chemical or physiological office of either class. Reject- 
cient. jj^g ^^^ division, we find another in the physiological 

office of food, which is either nitrogenetic or calorifacient, — 
flesh-forming or heat-producing. To this it is objected that it 
is not yet proven that the production of animal heat is a proc- 
ess of combustion ; yet it is so plain that animal heat is main- 
tained by some kind of chemical process carried out under phy- 
siological control ; so plain that the class of nitrogenetics cannot 
produce heat except at a gTeat waste ; so plain that the so-called 
calorifacients cannot, under any circumstances, become converted 
into plastic compounds, that the objection loses all practical 
force. We know that the nitrogenetics are the only source of 
muscular flesh. We know, also, that the calorifacients contain 
the elements of animal heat ; and whether those elements are 
actually burned, or in some other manner applied to the same pur- 



SALTS OF LliME, SQDA, ETC. 69 



f'V 






pose, is a question which is neveu practically employed in our 
studies of alimentation. 

All foods may be expressed in one chemical triad, namely. Al- 
buminoids, Starch and its products, and Fats. Of these, Aibumin- 
the first are nitrogenetic, flesh-forming. Starches and andfat^^ ' 

ts are calorifacient, — heat-producing, — and do not contain the 
elements of muscle. They cannot, therefore, perform the office of 
albuminoids ; but albuminoids may, and doubtless do, in the proc- 
ess of their excretion from the system, become calorifacient. 
Thus we reach at once the safe conclusion that nitrogenetic food 
may imperfectly perform all the offices required ; that a man will 
avoid starvation much longer on albuminoids alone, than he will 
on starches or fats only. 

Allied to foods — in the better sense of the word, actual foods 
— are the various salts of lime, soda, potash, iron, mag- saitsofiime 
nesia, and phosphorus, which are all essential to the ^°^^>^*'^- 
proper assimilation of food. In all good diet-scales they are, with 
the exception of common salt, found provided by Nature in suffi- 
cient quantities, and beyond that they do not need to be sought 
after. As artificial substitutes for food, the cerebral stimulants, 
alcohol, coffee, and tea, may be mentioned. And as all foods find 
their final expression in the constitution of healthy blood, we here 
introduce Le Ganu's analysis of that fluid.

The albuminoid compounds differ from the other classes of food 
Albuminoid ^^ ^^® csscntial. They contain nitrogen, and without 
compounds, nftrogeu there can be no muscular flesh ; and, so far as 
muscular vigor is concerned, the nutritive value of any food is in a 
direct ratio with the amount of nitrogen it contains. The impor- 
tance of the albuminoid element is well expressed, in the table of 
Le Canu, in the large amounts of albumen found in fibrin and 
blood; and, in the table of Playfau% in the amount of nitrogen 
found in flesh. The part performed by the carbo - hydrates 
(starches), and hydro-carbons (fats), is less conspicuous. The 
rapid assimilation of these elements, and their equally rapid de- 
struction after assimilation, keep their volume, at any one time, 
circulating in the blood, small ; while the amount chemically con- 
sumed is large. Per contra^ albuminoids are slow in assimilation, 
and slow in submitting to the destructive processes. They have 
more permanence in the system, and find their outlet from the 
economy through the channel of the blood ; while the calorifa- 
cients, after destiTiction, are mainly gotten rid of by exhalation 
from the lungs in the form of carbonic acid gas.

hospitals of London, " derives the conclusion that nitrogenized 
should be to non-nitrogenized food as one is to five." Frerichs 
puts his estimate in ounces : nitrogenous 2.17 oz. to non-nitroge- 
nous food 15.54 Oz. ; or, as one is to seven. Prof. Christison, the 
distinguished Edinburgh savant, says in his " Observations on a 
Report by Sir John McNeill, relative to the Diet of Soldiers," ^ 
1 Vide Repoi't of Ciimean Commissioners, Appendix xxxii. 




ELEMENTS IN MILK. 71 

" Soldiers in the field will be the more efficient the nearer they are 
brought to the athletic constitution. But as the demand for christison's 
protracted, unusual exertion occurs only at intervals, the ^^^^of 
highly nutritive athletic diet is not absolutely necessary. On "J^*^'^^''^ 
the whole, from experience in the case of other bodies of ^^^ sowier. 
men somewhat similarly circumstanced, twenty-eight ounces of real 
nutriment, of which seven are nitrogenous or reparative, will proba- 
bly prove the most suitable. Any material reduction below twenty- 
eight ounces will certainly not answer ; and under unusual exertion, 
kept up for days continuously, as in forced marches or forced siege 
labor, the quantity should for the time be greater, if possible." 

It is eminently desirable that a real and definite understanding 
of the term " nitrogenous " should be reached. All the geaseof the 
ordinary foods, sugar excepted, are to some extent nitrog- en(ms!''*Nu^ 
enous, but the percentage of nitrogen in them varies menlsS'the 
from one half of one per cent, to fifteen per cent. We ®^^' 
shall attain, in the course of this chapter, a more exact under- 
standing, though hardly a better phraseology in reference to the 
plastic elements. In the mean time, we pass from this imperfect 
approximation to a typical diet, to the model which Natm-e fiir- 
nishes in the food she provides for the embryo and the infant. 
The unborn chick finds within the egg all the elements of growth 
at a time when, secluded in its shell, it has neither exercise nor 
respiration to cause waste, and when it derives its animal heat from 
the incubation of the mother hen. These elements are albumen 
and fats, with the necessary salts, the phosphates of lime, even, 
being cunningly provided by the phosphorus of the yolk and the 
lime of the shell. 

In the food provided for the infant, we have all the conditions. 
The child exercises, respires, maintains its own animal Elements ia 
heat, and performs all the frmctions of growth and waste, ™'"'" 
with the maternal milk for its only diet. The conditions of life 
in the infant vary from those in the adult in only one essential. 
The great business of the infant is flesh-making. It has not only 
to maintain its animal heat and existing status, but it must con- 
stantly accumulate and hoard material for its growth. Hence we 
should anticipate a provision by nature for this want. And when 
the adult becomes an infant — when he, too, by reason of sickness 
must maintain the old and build up the new fabric of health and 
strength — we should careftiUy adapt his diet to his doubled neces- 
sities. In the case of the infant, we accordingly find the analysis 
of milk presenting the foUowmg elements : —

1.000 

Here, reduced to dryness, we find the proportion of nitrogenous 
food as one to one-and-a-half of non-nitrogenous. As the child 
progresses toward manhood, as growth is completed, and the proc- 
ess of construction of tissue is at last limited to the daily waste, 
the proportion of nitrogenous food diminishes until it approximates 
to some one of the several ratios given by Christison, Benek^, and 
Frerichs — which, we hope to show. The old man reverses the 
gradation and seeks for fats and starches. This ratio, however, can 
never be considered as a fixed quantity. It varies with the daily 
hfe of the individual, with his labor, his hours of ease, his sleep, his 
climate, and his clothing. As we change our skies we change our 
appetites. The dainty boy of careful nurture, who detested fats at 
home, is a devourer of raw bacon after a few weeks of exposure 
in a campaign ; and the vegetarian of the cities becomes almost 
purely carnivorous when " roughing it " on the great plains of the 
West. 

It is necessary then to recognize nitrogen as the plastic, and ca^- 
Army rations ^^^ ^^ ^hc hcat-produciug element ; to state the prox- 
diffCTlnT^ imate and ultimate analysis of different foods in actual 
nations. weights, and to rest their nutritive value on their approx- 
imation to, or departure from, a certain standard diet which is ac- 
cessible, and which is derived from the experience of vast numbers 
of men, in all climates, and subjected to all vicissitudes, as well as 
from the deductions of chemical and physiological science. To this 
end we will take up the army rations of several different nations, 
and the dietaries of a number of prisons and alms-houses ; stating 
in the first place of what they consist, and then reducing them to 
their ultimate elements. We shall thus avoid the inaccurate classi- 
fication we have alluded to. 

In the analysis of these rations they will be considered as net 
weights, excluding the water, and, ultimately, the debris naturally 
combined with them. Before such an analysis, sundry explana- 
tions are necessary, and subsequent to it should follow a discussion 
of the arguments for and against any particular article of food, 
without much reference to its chemical constituents. 



UNITED STATES ABMY RATION.

NOTES ON THE DIFFERENT RATIONS. 

The United States army ration is, to a certain extent, rendered 
adaptable to all circumstances. Prior to the rebellion, united 
salt meat only was included in the commissariat supply- ration. 
table. Practically, liowever, the use of salt beef and pork was 
avoided in most instances, and fresh meat substituted through the 
operations of the " company fund." A fixed daily value was placed 
upon the ration. The value of any portion drawn, but saved by 
economy, was commuted in money and expended in any other 
food that might be cheaper, more available, or more healthful. 
These expenditures were usually made with good judgment and 
under favorable circumstances, so that a varied and healthfiil diet 
was often attained under the old army ration. During the sum- 
mer of 1861, an act of Congress enlarged and improved the 
ration.

no place to expend his money. His reliance then was on the camp-

In his comments on this dietary, Prof. Christison of chnstison's 
Edinburgh says : — ' comments. 

" These several diets approach on the whole nearly in total real nu- 
triment to the allowance for the British navy, which contains 28^ oz. of 
daily nutriment on an average, and which has been found very suitable. 
The diet of the first and seventh days alone are materially less. It 
would require an addition of four ounces of meat and four ounces of

NUTRITIVE VALUE OF RATIONS. 



bread to make them equal to the navy allowances." . . . . " The 
relative proportions of the carboniferous to the nitrogenous nutriment 
of the seven diets approaches nearly to that which scientific analysis 
has shown to be very exactly the proportion in the dietaries hitherto 
examined, which have been practically found satisfactory, namely, the 
ratio of three to one." 

In the use of the terms " carboniferous " and " nitrogenous " 
nutriment, Dr. Christison means actual weights of carbonaceous 
and protein compounds, — the water and the indigestible cellular 
tissues which most forms of food contain, having been rejected as 
non-nutrients. He asserts that " the nutritive value of any dietary- 
may be tested with care and certainty by reference to its chemical 
composition. In order, then, to test more thoroughly the nutritive 
values of the different rations enumerated, we have prepared the 
following table, in which a new subdivision has been added in the 
division of carbonaceous foods into starches and fats, and from 
which, finally, we have reduced the absolute weights of carbon and 
nitrogen. We have also given the weight of component salts, 
phosphates, lime, soda, etc., usually existent in foods : —

Notes. — As pork is substituted for beef in the U. S. army ration, two 
calculations were necessary. The pork ration furnishes less nitrogen 
than the quantity understood to be starvation point. 

In the British ration, Tulloch's third (or Tuesday's) dietary was 
taken as a fair standard. 

In the French, Turkish, and East India rations the fresh vegetables 
were not computed, for want of data. 

In the Russian ration the nutritive value of l^i^ quarts of " Kwass," 
an unknown fermented drink, is omitted. 

In all the rations, tea and coffee are omitted for want of sufficient 
data. 



DIETARIES OF PRISONS AND ALMS-HOUSES. TT 



^M A glance at the preceding table will show that the United States 
army ration has accidentally approximated itself to a Effects of a 
standard approaching that which has been experimentally niSJgenou°s^ 
found correct. Yet it should be remembered that the unuJd*^* 
amount of nitrogen given in the table is on the supposi- states Amy. 
tion that twenty ounces of beef are issued daily. We have already 
shown that the caprice of a commanding officer, the ignorance of 
^^ a surgeon, or the accidents of the service may, at any time, reduce 
^H the nitrogenous food to a point which will occasion starvation of 
^^ the muscular system. It is indeed notorious that muscular attenu- 
ation frequently occurred among men who rarely suffered hunger, 
and who, perhaps, considered themselves well fed. And when this 
attenuation, or starvation, reached the most important of muscles, 
the heart, it produced a train of symptoms known as " functional 
disease of the heart," characterized by very rapid pulse, short 
breath, general debility ; and recovery was always slow. Many 
thousands of soldiers were discharged the service for this disorder 
prior to the organization of the Veteran Reserve or Invalid Corps. 
It was not clearly understood to be a disease of assimilation, to be 
cured only by food, although the inefficacy of medicines was plain 
to all. 

It is a matter of the utmost importance to decide upon the rela- 
tive proportions and the actual quantities of each of the Dietaries of 
component parts of food, which are necessary to support Ethousel 
the athletic constitution. Christison argues that nitrog- aSntai- 
enous substances should be to non-nitrogenous as one to "°«^***ion. 
three ; Beneke, as one to five ; Frerichs, as one to seven ; while 
Prof. John Stanton Gould found the dietaries of eight hard-labor 
prisons in the Northern States to average daily 2.846 ounces of 
nitrogenous food, and that the men improved in flesh under that 
quantity ; while in seven alms-houses the amount of nitrogenous 
food daily was only 1.77 oz. The " Sixth Report of the Medical 
Officer olP the Privy Council" [London, 1863], in forwarding Dr. 
Edward Smith's Report on the food of the lowest-fed classes of 
England, offers a scientific estimate, " necessarily imperfect " but 
" approximate and provisional," of what " quantity of food might 
on an average just suffice to avert starvation diseases." He 
says : — 

" Its purport was, that in order to avert starvation diseases, an average 
woman's daily food ought to contain at least 3.900 grains of carbon with 
180 grains of nitrogen ; and an average man's daily food at least 4.300 
grains of carbon with 200 grains of nitrogen ; i. e., for the woman about 



78 CARBONACEOUS AND NITROGENOUS FOOD. 

the same quantity of the nutritive elements as is contained in two 
pounds of good wheaten bread, and for the man about a ninth part more. 
Taking the mean of the two allowances, male and female, the estimated 
weekly need of an average adult would be for at least 28,600 grains of 
carbon and 1330 grains of nitrogen. It will be observed that in onlj 
one of the examined classes of in-door operatives did the average 
nitrogen supply just exceed, while in another it nearly reached, the esti- 
mated standard of bare sufficiency, and that in two classes there was 
defect — in one a very large defect — of both nitrogen and carbon. 
Moreover, as regards the examined families of the agricultural popula- 
tion, it appeared that more than a fifth were with less than the esti- 
mated sufficiency of carbonaceous food ; that more than one third were 
with less than the estimated sufficiency of nitrogenous food ; and that 
in three counties insufficiency of nitrogenous food was the average local 
diet." 

The consequence of this semi-starvation of British laborers is 
stated in the report to be a reduction to brutishness, to extreme 
selfishness, and loss of the natural affections ; the latter disgrace- 
fiilly exhibited in the intentional starvation of infants by parents 
who conld not support them. Among soldiers, short rations pro- 
duce analogous effects in loss of the feeling of comradeship, in 
refusal to submit to discipline, and in a tendency to marauding 
among the people of the country. 

It v^^ill be seen that if the experience of British statisticians has 
Errorofsub- led them to the conclusion tliat 200 grains daily of nitro- 
bonaceous gcn is barely sufficient to avert starvation diseases, then 
enous food, the 367 grains of our army ration in its best form cannot 
be too much to maintain the athletic constitution, and that the con- 
stant substitutions of carbonaceous food for nitrogenous, w^hich 
are authorized by the law, and which are practically carried out in 
nearly all American commissariats, are serious errors, impairing 
the health of the soldier and constituting the cause of the painfully 
frequent diseases of assimilation which have so greatly weakened 
the efficiency of our armies. Perhaps nowhere have practical 
experiments been made on so large and reliable a scale as in the 
armies of the United States, and in the prisons and organized 
camps attached to them. In the absence of exact knowledge of 
the amount of nitrogen required, we can wisely resort to our 
experience in the effects of known dietaries. If under a certain 
diet the men increased in flesh and strength, the quantity of nitro- 
gen was sufficient. If they lost, then vice versa. To some of the 
more extended of these great experiments we shall now refer. 




EXPERIENCE AT CONVALESCENT CAMP, VA. 79 

1. At Convalescent Camp, Va., the men received were nearly all 
m hospitals en route to their commands. Those not Experience 
yet fit for duty were retained to undergo a further rep- ceu?campr 
arative or seasoning process. From August 17, 1862, to ^*' 
February 26, 1865, 224,381 men passed tlirough the camp. It 
was not until about February 1, 1863, that the camp was in 
proper condition to judge of its results. From that time up to 
its disbanding, about 150,000 soldiers had a longer or shorter resi- 
dence at this place, the average population being perhaps about 
4000. These men were subjected to the following conditions: 
They were all in imperfect health. They were housed in well- 
warmed and ventilated barracks ; had free range of extensive and 
pleasant grounds ; were detailed for light fatigue duty a part of the 
time, giving them exercise enough for appetite ; and were disci- 
plined to a scrupulous cleanliness. Under these favorable circum- 
stances it was found that the men did not consume the ration, and 
that large camp-savings resulted. The food was all cooked under 
one supervision, the men eating it in the four great dining-rooms 
provided. Each man ate as much or as little as his appetite re- 
quired, some doubtless eating more than the full ration. Yet in 
the month of June it was found that nearly two fifths of the ration 
had been saved, the saving being mostly in fats and starches. 
Somewhat less than the full ration of nitrogen was consumed, 
though, taking into account the excellence of the cookery, it may 
be assumed that the quantity of digestible nitrogen was equal to the 
frill ration. Subsequently the system of savings was abandoned, 
or rather the savings were converted into extra allowances of veoj- 
etables ; but the experiment was tried long enough to show that 
under these very favorable circumstances, the quantity of carbon 
vras largely in excess of the wants of the soldier, and that less than 
four fifths of the entire ration was sufficient to repair previous 
losses by disease and recreate the athletic constitution. It should 
be noted that during the twenty-six months existence of the New 
Convalescent Camp no epidemic of any sort occurred in its limits. 
It was the boast of its officers that no zymotic disease ever orig- 
inated there. It could not have been a deficient diet that produced 
these results, and an experiment so large and long continued is of 
equal weight with any chemical analysis of excreta. And from 
such an experience we may approximate to the necessary standard 
for active field service.

Confederate prisoners of war was established, in general terms,

order several hundred thousands were fed for periods of prison 
residence of from a few weeks to many months in the great prison 
camps at St. Louis, Rock Island, Chicago, Johnson's Island, Camp 
Chase, Elmira, Annapolis, Point Lookout, and elsewhere. In all 
these places the prisoners had shelter and warmth and no duty ex- 
cept their own policing. They had a fat, oily, but not athletic 
look ; yet their condition was such that the Confederate Commis- 
sioner of Exchange, Robert Ould, spoke of them as " splendid 
material " which he was receiving in barter for the starved victims 
of Andersonville. In our opinion they were only fat and not ath- 
letic, but they were in a position to be made speedily efficient by 
more nitrogen and moderate exercise.

Account by quantity 01 nitrogen it contained can be formed, beyond 
Jones. the broad fact that it was insufficient. Its effects, finally, 

on the constitution of the men are thus spoken of by Dr. Joseph 
Jones, a Confederate surgeon of fine acquirements, after allowing 
liberally for all the food in excess of the ration which the soldier 
may have procured by a careless system of foraging, or by dona- 
tions from home. In speaking of diseases allied with faulty assim- 
ilation and surgical accidents that we all attribute to impoverished 
blood. Dr. Jones says : — 

" The great fact, however, was observed at the General Hospital at 
Charlottesville, Va., and in numerous other hospitals throughout the 
Southern Confederacy, while well-marked symptoms of scurvy were not 
often observed among the wounded, and while the men from the battle- 
field presented a strong and healthy appearance ; at the same time sec- 
ondary hemorrhage and hospital gangrene progressively increased during 
the progress of the war, and the former complication of gunshot wounds 
became fearfully prevalent. The great increase of secondary hemor- 
rhage appeared to be referable to the prolonged use of salt meats and 
the consequent scorbutic condition of the blood, although the active 
symptoms of scurvy were not manifested. The increase of hospital 
gangrene may, in a measure at least, have been connected with physical 
and chemical changes of the blood and organs dependent on imperfect 
nutrition." 

"Whilst at Danville, Va., in 1862, Dr. Cabell treated a large number

of cases of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, and a number terminated 
fatally. With men sent to private quarters, and abandoned simply to 
the kind attention of friends, with little or no treatment beyond domes- 
tic remedies and good nutritious diet, the results were most happy, and 
many recovered, who, it is thought, would have died if left in hospital. 
Dr. Cabell expressed the belief that almost every case, which had not 
extensive ulcerations of the mucous membrane, would be cured by a 
change of diet."

column, was subjected in 1864-65 to gi-eat hardships. Experience

the Tupelo raid. Later in the season the corps crossed the Mis- 
sissippi and made a campaign of great severity in Arkansas and 
Missouri, in pursuit of Gen. Price's invasion, returning via St. 
Louis and Cairo to Nashville, Tenn., in time to participate in the 
decisive battle under Major-General Thomas. Thence it was or- 
dered to Eastport, Miss. ; next to New Orleans, and thence via 
Fish River to the siege of Mobile. That completed, the corps 
marched to Montgomery, Ala., and its First Division was finally 
encamped at Selma, Ala., about May 1st, 1865. Long and ex- 
hausting campaigns, sieges, and battles, mostly on the hard bread 
and bacon ration, had reduced the vitality of its gallant veterans. 
Scurvy and chronic diarrhoea became alarmingly prevalent. The 
Surgeon-in-Chief of the division directed all cases of " assimila- 
tive disease " to be sent early to the division hospital. There, 
under the superintendence of Surgeon Murta, 8th Wisconsin Vol- 
unteers, a large ward had been prepared for the dietetic treatment 
of diseases of assimilation. In cleanliness and ventilation it was 
nearly perfect. The diet gave great prominence to albuminoids 
and fresh vegetables — very little to drugs, which were almost dis- 
carded. Eggs, custards, chickens, beef, mutton, onions, lettuce, 
greens, potatoes, fruits, and wines of the hock variety, were freely 
employed. Fats also were allowed, but the starches were almost 
excluded. The results obtained were most gratifying, excelling in 
success any that the writer has witnessed elsewhere. It was a 
triumph of nitrogenous diet. 

5. The army of the Frontier, head-quarters at Fort Smith, 
Ark., during the year 1864, averaged only about one half Experience 
rations issued from the commissariat. This one half was ^f Jh^ '"''"^ 
eked out by foraging and the peculiarly enterprising hab- portSith,

surface. Yet in cases of wounds and surgical operations, the scor-

butic taint was always manifest, and a most unfavorable percentage 
of results followed. 

6. The Confederate prison at Andersonville, Ga., exhibits its 
Confederate records elsewhere in this volume. It is only necessary 
dersonviiie. to Call attention to the phenomena of inanition as they 
are there portrayed. They prove what for the credit of human 
nature should not have been proven in the 19th century — that 
starvation and an insufficient diet are synonymous terms, and that 
a lingering death is the common end of each. 

So far, then, as we are able to reach definite results from these 
Conclusions Statements, and from the experience of other armies than 
B^trogenSis ^^^ ^"^^^' ^^ ^^7 couclude that the amount of nitrogen 
^®** estimated by Prof. Christison is not excessive. It is as- 

sumed that 200 grains of nitrogen per diem is sufficient to avert 
starvation, and the history of Federal prisons confirms the assump- 
tion. And we consider it proven that from 350 to 400 grains is 
enough to support a high standard of athletism. It should be 
recollected that armies are not always " marching along ; " that 
the occasions of great fatigue are just those when there is least 
transportation for food and least time to cook properly. Such pe- 
riods of extravagant waste of tissue are fortunately brief, as a gen- 
eral thing. The verdict of observers is that in the attempt to alle- 
viate their hardships all effiarts should be directed to increasing the 
supply of nitrogen. The marching ration should be beef rather 
than pork, and in this country it is hardly ever impossible to pro- 
cure cattle, either by driving them along on the hoof with the col- 
umn or by foraging. No non-combatant theory should ever prevent 
a commanding officer from feeding his troops by foraging when 
necessary ; of course under judicious restrictions. And when he 
is able to issue the ration allowance of beef, or to substitute for it 
lean pork or mutton, he is not likely to find diseases of assimilation 
arising among his soldiers. In 1864, the 54th U. S. C. I. spent 
about three weeks upon the prairies in the Cherokee Nation, north 
of Fort Gibson. They were exposed to several snow-storms, des- 
titute of tents or other shelter, and were almost without rations, 
except beef, which was abundant in the herds of wild cattle in 
those regions. Yet the command returned in perfect health, so 
bountiful had been their supply of nitrogen. During the previous 
summer the 11th U. S. C. I. had been camped several weeks on 
the prairie, subsisting entirely on hard bread, bacon, and small 
stores. Scurvy became very prevalent, but was speedily gotten 
rid of by changing the meat ration to beef, and ordering the neu-

NORMAL PROPORTION OF FAT AND STARCH. 83 

tral salts of potash to be given to the men. The effect was marked 
and unmistakable. 

While it seems plain that the full [beef] ration contains enough 
of nitrogen, it is to be regretted that our soldiers rarely obtained 
that quantity, owing to the unscientific manner in which fats and 
starches were substituted for albuminoids, as if they were equiva- 
lents in nutritive value ; forgetting that a ton of butter will not 
replace an ounce of muscle, and that in plastic nutrition one hun- 
dred and thirty pounds of rice are as good only as seventeen pounds 
of beef. Says Lehmann : — 

" AVhen, however, we seek to ascertain the most favorable mixture of 
the nutritive elements, we must not think that this will remain one and 
the same for all conditions ; the proportions of the nutritive elements 
must, on the contrary, change according to the state in which the organ- 
ism to be nourished is ; its necessities will as little always demand the 
same proportions of this mixture, as the necessity for food remains con- 
stant in regard to the absolute quantity." 

CARBONACEOUS FOODS. 

The quantity of carbonaceous food varies from twenty-seven 
ounces in the Turkish ration to twenty-one ounces in the Quantity in 
United States ration, and so on a gradually decreasing rations. 
scale to the nine ounces, stated by British authorities to be barely 
sufficient to avert starvation diseases. The proportions are notice- 
ably the same as those stated in the discussion of nitrogenous food, 
and it is interesting to find that experiences so widely separated 
reach at last results so nearly identical. The quantity of absolute 
carbon in the American and British rations is about thirteen and a 
half ounces in each. This quantity is found in the entire ration, 
as even the muscular meats, which we speak of as " nitrogenous," 
contain 53 per cent, of carbon. 

It is desirable that we should, if possible, arrive at some idea of 
the normal proportions of the two components of car- Normal pro- 
bonaceous food; i. e., how much should be fat and how fat and 
much starch or its products. Sugar and starch are products, 
convertible terms, the latter undergoing- a transformation into 
the former in the process of digestion. In those manufactories 
where starch is converted into sugar as a commercial enterprise, a 
bushel of Indian-corn is considered equal to twenty-five pounds of 
starch, and one pound of starch will make one pound of sugar. 
And the same is true in the digestive laboratory. But one pound 
of sugar will not make one pound of fat, and hence arises a differ- 



84 QUANTITY OF CARBON REQUIRED. 

ence in the relative value of fats and starches as foods. In their 
final conversion into carbonic acid gas, fat consumes nearly two and 
a half times as much oxygen as starch does, and is, therefore, in 
just that ratio, more valuable as a fuel. 

We do not consider it settled that sugar is burned as sugar in 
Metamor- the systcm to maintain the animal heat ; nor that, on the 
sugar. other hand, it is always converted into fat before under- 

going combustion. In fact, it is not yet positively known that the 
animal heat is maintained by a process identical with combustion. 
For the purposes of this chapter it is only necessary to know that 
carbonaceous food is, in some manner, destroyed in the system in 
the maintenance of animal heat ; that the portion assimilated and 
not immediately destroyed is transformed into fat, thus furnishing 
a storehouse of fuel, which, whenever the outside supply of carbon 
fails, is in its turn destroyed for its original purpose as the source 
of heat. 

Hence it would seem, at first glance, that it would be well to 
Proper reia- ccutre all our carbouaccous foods in fat, and thus spare 
tionofTaT' *^® digestive system the labor and fatigue of transform- 
and starches, -j^g ^Yie lowQY to the higher form of carbon. Unluckily 
for this notion, the function of digestion has been organized by 
nature with all the machinery necessary for these several duties. 
This machinery must work or become lazy and rusty, and when it 
becomes so, it is a positive evil, engendering disease. And, farther, 
the machinery assigned to the work of absorbing fat — digesting 
it — is not large, nor active enough to supply the system with all 
the carbon it needs. Plence, both a division of labor, and several 
forms of material designed for the same result, become necessary ; 
and out of that grows the demand for a varied diet, in which all 
three elements of this trinity — starch, sugar, and fat — shall be 
present. The data are insufficient by which to estimate the proper 
proportion between fats and starches in our food (sugars being con- 
sidered as perfected starches) ; but if we take the relative size of 
the intestinal absorbents that take up fat, and those that take up 
starch, as a criterion, we might assume that the proportion should 
be as one of fat to five or six of starch. And as a matter of fact, 
our table shows this to be about the proportion in the adult. In 
the infant it is higher, being as 30 parts of butter to 44 of sugar. 

The absolute quantity of carbon required for the athletic con- 
Quantity of stitutiou is ouly to be ascertained, like that of nitrogen, 
required, as by rcasouiug from dietaries, the success or unsuccess of 
dieTaries^ which has been proven. Prof. Liebig states the average 



AMOUNT OF CARBON IK U. S. ARMY RATION. 



B' daily consumption of carbon by tlie body-guard of the Grand Duke 
of Hesse-Darmstadt at 13.9 oimces, which would require for its 
^— , conversion into carbonic acid gas 37 ounces of oxygen. Draper 
^B states the average ingestion of oxygen at about 35 ounces daily. 
H^ The "Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council" 
^K (London, 1863), estimates 9 ounces of carbon per diem as the 
^K quantity just sufficient to avert starvation diseases. Nearly all 
^^ army rations largely exceed these quantities, though it may be that 
they do so in the ignorant attempt to compensate for the deficiency 
of nitrogen. It is certain, however, that the soldier needs more 
carbon than the civilian. We have seen how little carbon is re- 
quired for the chick, whose animal heat is maintained by the incu- 
bation of the mother-hen ; and the human animal repeats the same 
conditions when he lives in-doors and in heated rooms, and sur- 
rounds himself at night with non-conducting bedding. So the sol- 
dier, sleeping on the ground and rapidly radiating the heat of his 
system, in all ways exposed to constant loss of caloric, calls for 
more carbon, and soon acquires a fondness for fats and fat-pro- 
ducing foods. Again, even this demand may be increased by 
active exercise, and every extra exertion must be repaired by 
extra quantity of food. 

The 21 ounces of carbonaceous food in the U. S. army ration 
contain 13.707 ounces of absolute carbon. Physiologists Amount of 
have fixed upon 35 ounces of oxygen as the amount daily united ^" 
ingested, a part of which is consumed in excreting the ration.*™^ 
nitrogenous products. Hence it seems fair to assume starches. 
that the quantity of starches and fats is ample, though the latter 
might be judiciously increased in periods of cold and exposure. 
The waste of starches, so notorious in our army, does not arise 
from an excess of carbon in the ration as we have calculated it, on 
the basis of the beef issue ; but from the fact that instead of the 
beef, pork or bacon were issued much or most of the time, swelling 
tlie quantity of carbon for the day to 21 ounces (absolute carbon), 
which would require a respiratory capacity to take in 56 ounces 
of oxygen in twenty-four hours. The absurdity is manifest ; 40 
ounces of oxygen must be nearly the limit of Esquimaux capacity. 
It is assuredly the final limit in our temperate climate. 

Having thus shown the source of the notorious and extravagant 
waste which attended the full (pork or bacon) ration in all com- 
mands during the late war, we shall endeavor to specify, in consid- 
ering special foods, the changes that can profitably be made with 
benefit to the soldier and economy to the government. 



86 IMPORTANCE OF FRESH VEGETABLES. 



FRESH VEGETABLES AND SALTS. 

The only fresh vegetables provided in the army ration are 
Provision for potatoes at the rate of three pounds per week per man. 

vcfiTctfiblcs in. ' ~_ _ 

United The Act of 1861, however, provides that " when beans, 

States army . , . i • i 

ration. pease, rice, hommy, or potatoes cannot be issued, an 

equivalent in value shall be issued in some other proper food." 
From this source only can fresh vegetables be procured, except 
when the organization is sufficiently thorough to provide a com- 
pany fund. Rations not consumed by a company are designated 
as " company savings,"" and the commissary may re-purchase them 
from the company, paying over to the company council of adminis- 
tration their cost value. These savings constitute, with distribu- 
tions from post-ftmds, a company fund "to be disbursed by the 
captain for the benefit of the enlisted men of the company, pur- 
suant to the resolves of the company council, consisting of all the 
officers present." Company funds, however, may be applied to 
other than food purposes, as, for instance, libraries. 

It will be seen at once that in the case of great armies it is sim- 
ply impossible for the commissary to issue an equivalent in value 
of other proper food for pease, beans, rice, etc., not on hand for 
issue. The demand so far exceeds the local supply as to act as a 
prohibition. Nor are company funds easily available in a cam- 
paign. The result is that fresh vegetables are very rarely issued 
to the men, an evil that might, to a valuable extent, be avoided by 
making the equivalent in lieu of starches optional. If instead of 
saying " when pease, beans, etc., cannot be issued," the law were 
to say, that when " they may not be issued, an equivalent in 
value shall be issued in some other proper food," the power 
would then rest in the hands of the medical officers to adapt the 
diet to the circumstances, and secure at frequent intervals a change 
from starches to fresh vegetables. At present, the order of a gen- 
eral commanding an army is the lowest authority for the purchase 
of fresh vegetables. 

The importance of this form of food is universally conceded, if 
Importance not Scientifically understood. We recognize in our natu- 
vegetabies. ral craving for the succulent vegetables a proof of their 
necessity, and when deprived of them, we find that the blood un- 
dergoes changes producing diseases of assimilation. Yet it is plain 
that the great value of fresh vegetables does not lie in their carbon 
or nitrogen. They contain nearly 90 per cent, of water, and are 
therefore bulky and expensive in transportation, and altogether

unavailable as foods in the sense which we have employed in the 
previous treatment of this subject. What then is their value ? 

Starvation is a comparative phrase. We can starve muscle by 
withholding nitrogen. We can starve the fats of the Sense of the 
body and destroy the animal heat by withholding carbon, tion. 
So, too, we can starve the brain by withholding phosphorus, and 
starve the blood by failing to supply it with those salts of lime, 
potash, soda, iron, and magnesia, which are essential to its healthy 
condition. Just how these salts exert their power is not known ; 
but Ave do know that when they are withheld the blood globule 
becomes pale and irregular in form, and starvation diseases are de- 
veloped. Without these, nitrogen no longer builds up the muscle, 
and carbon fails to maintain the animal heat. 

These salts of the blood constitute about one per cent, of its 
weight. One of them, chloride of sodium, or common saitsof the 
salt, is provided in the ration at the rate of six tenths of ri^e^d from 
an ounce daily to each soldier. This provides the muri- ^ee«**^i«s. 
atic acid necessary for the gastric juice, but no formal provision is 
made for the other and almost equally important salts of lime, potash, 
iron, etc. The source of these salts is twofold. They are found, 
first, in the water we drink, which is almost always impregnated 
with mineral substances ; and, second, in what may be considered 
as their natural source, the fruits and succulent vegetables. To 
these sources there is another to be added in the case of common 
salt, which is craved in excess of the natural supply by both the 
human animal and the brute. But the only reliable source of our 
phosphorus and potash is in the vegetable foods. 

It is possible that the dietetic value of fresh vegetables rests 
largely upon this fact — as if the luscious fruits were Na- Desiccated 
ture's sugar-plum to tempt the grown-up boy of humanity ''^s*^*^'^'^^- 
to take his daily dose of salts. Evidently were these salts isolated, 
instead of being pleasantly combined with the malic, citric, and 
tartaric acids, they would be too unpalatable. However this may 
be, the loss of health incident upon a deprivation of some elements 
— which we suggest to be salts — in fresh vegetables, has led to 
the effort to supply them in a desiccated form. Paragraph 1191, 
Revised Regulations, I860, orders that — " Desiccated compressed 
potatoes, or desiccated compressed mixed vegetables, at the rate of 
one ounce and a half of the former, and one ounce of the latter, 
to the ration, may be substituted for beans, pease, rice, hominy, or 
fresh potatoes." This regulation exhibits again the unscientific 
features which have crept into our traditional ration. The one 



88 CHRISTISON ON SALT MEAT. 

ounce of desiccated vegetables can in no manner be made a substi- 
tute for the 81^5 ounces of starches named, nor would the starches 
supplement the salts in the vegetables. 

The use of desiccated vegetables has been to some extent a 
failure. To prevent their decomposition it was necessary to make 
their desiccation very thorough ; so thorough that only very care- 
ful and inteUigent cookery could make them soft and palatable. 
And as an antiseptic they contained an undue amount of pepper, 
which is unsuited to the simple tastes of the soldier. Their abso- 
lute value, however, as a substitute for fresh vegetables, cannot be 
disputed, and we by no means despair of seeing the experiment 
entirely successftil. Recent achievements in the preserving of 
fruits, pat^s, oysters, etc., seem to assure us that this special diffi- 
culty may be overcome at an early day. 



NOTES ON SPECIAL COMPONENTS OF THE RATION. 

Beef^ Fresh or Salt. — In the ration existing previous to 1861, 
only salt beef was mentioned, of which 16 ounces was the daily 
allowance, except when pork was issued in lieu. It Avas optional, 
however, with the commanding officer to substitute fresh beef two 
or three times a week, and when it could be purchased for less 
than six and a quarter cents a pound it might be issued five times 
a week. In the substitution one and a quarter pounds of fresh beef 
was considered equivalent to one pound of salt meat. This was 
one of the errors of tradition. Christison says : — 

" If soldiers could be supplied with what people in civil life know as 
Christison Salt meat, there would be less difficulty ; but military authorities 
on salt meat. Qyg|^|- ^q discharge their minds of this very natural compari- 
son. The salt meat for soldiers in the field has always been highly 
salted, in order to keep for two years or more in every climate. Now. 
my persuasion is that, apart from the tendency of the protracted use of 
such food to favor the development of disease, its nutritive value has 
been very much overrated. This may appear evident from the fact 
stated in the Report, that of a body of men, fed even on rations by no 
means liberal, few continued to eat a pound of salt meat daily for any 
length of time. And the science of the question has been sufficiently 
looked into for an explanation ; because meat highly salted must be so 
thoroughly steeped in cold water to remove the salt, before it is eatable 
in large quantity, that much of its most nutritive constituents must be 
washed out of it, namely, its albumen and sapid extracts called osma- 
zome." 




OBJECTION TO HARD BREAD. 89 

Yet in the U. S. army ration a pound of salt beef with its albu- 
men and osmazome (we may add also its phosphates and ug^it 
potash) washed out, is considered an equivalent to a pound ^^^^•'" 
and a quarter of fresh beef with all its juices present ! Allowance 
of about one sixth should be made for the fact that salt beef has 
no bone, but in the present state of the art of preserving meats 
that of hio-h-saltinsi; is somewhat obsolete. " Salt horse " is some- 
thing very different from the corned beef of civil life, and fortu- 
nately it has never been largely used in the army. 

Pork or Bacon. — In the U. S. army ration, pork and bacon are 
almost exclusively fat, and are to be ranked only as car- p^^^ ^nd 
bonaceous food. They cannot, philosophically, be substi- substitutes 
tuted for beef. In the absence of butter, lard, and suet, ^^^ ^^^' 
the pork comes in as a most agreeable adjuvant to cooking, and 
its rich supply of carbon has vindicated its value in all armies. A 
third or half ration of pork, added to and tiot substituted for the 
beef ration, would at once facilitate the cookery of both, and would 
supply nearly all the carbon and nitrogen needed. The extra cost 
of this issue might readily be compensated by lessening the un- 
wieldy allowance of starches. 

Bread, Hard and Soft. — When hard bread only is issued, as in 
the marching ration, sixteen ounces is the daily allowance. 
It is practically a pound of flour, and is about equivalent 
to twenty-two ounces of soft bread. When flour is issued the ra- 
tion is twenty-two ounces, or quite enough to make thirty ounces 
of soft bread. It is an issue in excess. A company of 100 men 
draw 10 days rations of flour, namely, 1375 pounds. This flour 
should make, on the average, 1833 pounds of soft bread ; and as 
only 22 ounces of bread are issued, the result is a saving of 458 
pounds of flour, which may be re-sold to the commissary and con- 
verted into any other food. Many commands maintained this sav- 
ing at all times except when actually on the march. The sole 
object of the flour ration is to enable such a fund to be created. 

The objection has been made to hard bread that it is with difli- 
culty comminuted by the teeth, and that it is liable to un- objection to 
dergo the process of fermentation in the intestines, pro- i^^^^^^^^d. 
ducing yeast and a free development of carbonic acid gas. The 
flatulence thus created, at the cost of the destruction of the nutri- 
tive value of the bread, is alleged as one of the most prolific causes 
of chronic diarrhoea. There is an element of truth in this notion. 
We conceive the real fact to be, that a system enfeebled by expo- 
sure and deprivation of nitrogenous and fresh ve2;etable food soon 



90 ERRORS OF THE U. S. ARMY RATION. 

becomes incapable of properly digesting starches ; that under these 
conditions fermentation and distillation of the starch is substituted 
for its normal change into dextrine, and finally diarrhoea is thus 
produced. Experience has shown the propriety of withholding 
starches in chronic diarrhoea. But a healthy system, otherwise 
well nourished, will have no difficulty in digesting starches, whether 
in the form of hard or soft bread. 

Pease and Beans. — Of the two, the latter is the most nutritious.

consequent flatulence, a fault which forbids their use when the 
tendency to diarrhoea is strong. For active, healthy men, both 
pease and beans are a very nutritious and available food.

the stomach," i. e., of so checking the waste of the system as to 
enable it temporarily to endure privation of food. In quantity it 
is ample, but all commands will use all they obtain. Tea is to a 
certain extent the same in its essence and effects, but is less decided 
in flavor and in results. It is, consequently, rarely used except in 
hospitals, where its astringent qualities add to its other merits.

the system. 

SUMMARY. 
Errors of I* '^^'^ ^® sccu from the preceding pages that the U. 

sutes°Sy S. army ration is badly distributed. Its errors may be 
ration. briefly summed as follows : — 

1. In making fat pork or bacon a substitute for fresh beef, and 
thereby reducing the nitrogen of the ration below starvation point. 




HOW THE EVILS ARE TO BE REMEDIED. 91 



2. In making salt beef a substitute for fresh beef. It is not an 
equivalent. 

3. In making compressed vegetables a substitute for eight times 
their weight of starches. 

4. In an excessive quantity of carbonaceous foods and a defi- 
ciency of the saline elements. 

5. While the variety of carbonaceous foods may not be too 
great they are unduly cumulated. A system of rotation should 
be substituted. 

To remedy these evils it would be necessary to make pork and 
bacon a supplementary instead of a substitute ration. How the 
The beef ration, varied when possible by mutton or fresh be remedied. 
pork, being issued every day or nearly every day, the pork ration 
could be reduced one half or two thirds, to four or six ounces per 
diem. If we are correct in assuming that 13.707 ounces of abso- 
lute carbon is an average and 16 ounces an extreme limit of the 
wants of the soldier, then the carbonaceous components of the 
ration may safely be improved by a reduction in the starches and 
the substitution for them of a small amount of fats ; or, better still, 
by a system of rotation in which while the daily amount of carbon 
will be the same the foods will be varied and therefore more appe- 
tizing. A ration made up of twenty ounces beef, four ounces pork, 
sixteen ounces flour, one half pound potatoes, and two and a half 
ounces of beans, with eight ounces of fresh vegetables, would con- 
tain 15.169 ounces of actual carbon, about 390 grains of nitrogen, 
and 11.55 ounces of component salts, exclusive of common salt and 
coffee. It would thus supply all the wants of the system, instead 
of irregularly supplying sometimes one and sometimes another ele- 
ment, with no regard to which was most needed. 

Section 13 of the Act of Congress approved August 3, 1861, 
directs that " After the present insurrection shall cease, the ration 
shall be as provided by law and regulations on the first day of 
July, 1861 " ; that is, the old ration is reestablished. As we 
think we have shown that the old, as well as the present, ration is 
essentially unphilosophical, and that it is only endurable through 
the modifying influences of post and company funds, it seems that 
it would be better to take the present time for a careful revision of 
the commissariat. The formula we have proposed, with its accom- 
panying small stores, is a much richer ration than that of the old 
army ; but we believe not more expensive, when we consider the 
cost of transportation and the losses of salt meats and starches 
from the effects of climate. And in order to secure greater

variety, we would propose that the commissary should have power, 
under the orders of his immediate commanding officer, to substi- 
tute an occasional allowance of fruits and fresh vegetables, equal in 
money value to some other portion of the ration to be withheld. 
This would give adaptability and enable us to conform to circum- 
stances under restrictions sufficient to prevent increased cost. 

The economical argument should not be omitted. It was esti- 
mated in 1862 that it cost at that time about $1000 to put a soldier 
in the field. A piece of property of such value, especially when 
that value is to be annihilated in three years or sooner, is worthy 
of good care in a money point of view. The modifications we 
have proposed do not, we believe, increase the expense of main- 
taining the soldier. We propose to let the most essential part of 
our ration transport itself, inasmuch as beef on the hoof can almost 
always keep up with an ordinary march. It cannot in case of 
raids ; but all raids are designed to subsist, as far as possible, on 
the invaded country, and in the United States beef can always be 
captm-ed, if not purchased. "We propose also to reduce the amount 
of carbonaceous food transported. 

Suppose a column of 20,000 men starting on a twenty days' 
march with the full army-ration of salt meat, flour, beans, sugar, 
rice, coifee, vinegar, candles, soap, salt, pepper, potatoes, and mo- 
lasses. It would weigh 1,204,000 pounds, and require 602 wagons, 
carrying a ton each, to " roll it out " the first day. 

Suppose the same column to be moving on what we consider a 
more nutritious and every way better marching-ration, as follows : 
Beef on the hoof, one third rations of pork, full rations of all the 
other articles named in the paragraph above, with the addition of 
37,500 poimds of desiccated vegetables. It would weigh only 
836,500 pounds, and require only 418 wagons, thus reducing the 
wagon train one third. If the usual order to take three days' 
rations in the haversack were issued, the odds would be still larger 
in favor of the latter ration. 

This paper would be more incomplete than it confessedly is did 
Professor it omit to make mention of the able and well-directed, 
efforts todi- tliougli uot quitc succcssful cffort of Prof. E. N. Horsford, 
weight and latc Rumford Professor in Harvard University, to diminish 

bulk of the i i ia n i • i 

army ration, tlic wcight and Dulk 01 the army ration, and secure econ- 
omy in its administration. Prof. Horsford exhibits very clearly the 
loss of the nitrogenous element and phosphates in the ordinary 
superfine wheat flour issued to troops. Immediately within the 



TWO PLA^^S PROPOSED. 93 

bran or surface of the grain of wheat lies a shell of gluten, " the 
reservoir of vegetable fibrine and albumen, and of the phos- 
phates." Much of this is bolted away with the bran, the mid- 
dhngs, and the shorts, in the effort to make a white flour, and it is 
not unfair to estimate that the plastic value of the grain is thus 
reduced one half. 

To meet this evil. Prof. Horsford proposes two plans: First — 
To throw the supply of gluten entirely, or nearly so, on ^wo plans 
the meat ration, and to furnish phosphates artifi(;ially by p^<^p<^^^<^- 
the use of " self-raising flour " — an invention of Prof. Horsford's, 
in which bicarbonate of soda and pulverulent acid phosphate of 
lime are intimately intermingled with the flour. Such a floui' 
requires only to be mixed with water to insure the combination 
of the phosphoric acid with the alkaline soda, releasing the 
carbonic acid of the latter, and thus giving the necessary " light- 
ness," while the resulting salts, phosphates of lime and soda, are 
left in the bread to replace the loss created by the process of 
bolting. Second — Prof. Horsford proposes to secure the gluten 
and phosphatic salts by the simple process of roasting the wheat 
before grinding it, and putting it up unbolted. For a marching 
ration, this has the merits of a condensed nutritive value, the ex- 
pulsion of the water from the starch, and its easy preservation. 
Of its appetizing qualities it can only be said that it is not disagree- 
able. We have witnessed its use in the West in the form of 
parched corn, but it was usually held as a resource against probable 
starvation, and was never eaten when any other form of bread 
could be procured. In armies temporarily compelled to subsist 
upon it, it was usually accepted without undue complaint. 

In the supply of nitrogenous food. Prof. Plorsford accepts beef 
as the standard, and shows conclusively that if meat can be prop- 
erly desiccated and canned in its native pastures in Illinois, and still 
remain a palatable, nutritious food, it would save a vast proportion 
of the cost of transportation, the shrinkage en route, and the dis- 
eased condition of the meat produced by hunger, thirst, and over- 
crowding. It would, moreover, be valuable like all other conden- 
sations in the decreased amount of transportation on the march. 

As to the latter element, we have already expressed our belief 
that an infantry column can usually take its beef along on the hoof, 
or can purchase if among friends, or forage if among enemies, to an 
extent sufficient to keep up the supply. Even in cavalry raids, — 
which Prof. Horsford instances as incapable of doing this, — we 
have found, as a practical experience, that it can usually be done. 



94 TWO PLANS PROPOSED. 

It cannot be denied, however, that whenever beef can be fur- 
nished the army as Prof. Horsford proposes, a vast economy will 
result. Prof. Horsford estimates it at over $10,000,000 per annum 
in an army of 100,000 men. As a practical fact, we have as 
yet Httle experience. Prof. Horsford' s sausaged meat met with a 
strong prejudice from the soldiers, and has not been adopted ex- 
cept experimentally. But there can be little doubt that such a 
process is destined to perfection, and that it is within the resources 
of science to furnish a ration of preserved meats which shall be 
sweet, nutritious, healthful, and far more economical than our 
present methods of supply. It is to be hoped that the distin- 
guished scientist who has done so much already will continue his 
efforts and bring the concentrated marching ration to perfection.

THE WHISKY RATION. 

In order to obtain, as far as practicable, information concerning 
topics embraced in this section, the Medical Committee of the 
United States Sanitary Commission addressed to a large number 
of medical officers, who served in different sections of the country 
during the rebellion, a Circular including questions relating to va- 
rious influences affecting the physical endurance of troops and the 
power of resisting disease. A number of medical officers have 
responded to these questions, and it is the purpose of this chapter 
to give a digest of the information thus obtained. 

AGE. 

To the question concerning the period of life, during which were 
manifested the highest amount of physical endurance and the 
greatest power of resisting disease, explicit replies have been re- 
ceived from a large number of medical officers. The testimony 
of the great majority fixes the minimum at or above twenty years 
of age. Of the correspondents of the Commission, a few fix the 
minimum at an earlier age, but no one under eighteen years. 
Surgeon B. F. Stevenson, 22d Infantry, Kentucky Volunteers, 
writes that — 

" Some boys bore the vicissitudes of camp-life better than the ma- 
jority of men; but this does not prove that the same boys Testimony of 
as men, would not have been able to undergo a much greater sou. 
amount of fatigue." 

Several state as the minimum twenty-five and thirty years of age. 
The testimony is almost as uniform with respect to the maximum, 
only one fixing it above forty years. The maximum given by dif- 
ferent officers, ranges below forty to thirty years. Surgeon C. E. 
Denig, 28th Ohio Volunteers, furnishes the following statement : — 



96 TESTIMONY OF SUKGEONS. 

" Taking from the hospital register 100 names, the ages ranging from 
Testimony of 17 to 50 years, 25f was the average age of the sick. Of 
Denig. this number 80 were under, and 20 over, thirty years." 

The following is communicated by Surgeon E. Batwell, 14th In- 
fantry, Michigan Volunteers : — 

" From a list of 500 cases in the hospital of the second division. 
Testimony 14th Amiy Corps, during February and March, while the 
BatwdL^"^ army was marching through the Carolinas, it would seem that 
the period during which soldiers have the greatest immunity from 
disease, is between twenty-five and thirty years. Of these 500 cases, 
62 were between twenty-five and thirty years," 158 were between eight- 
een and twenty-five years, and 280 were between thirty and forty-five 
years. These figures have reference to those only who were sick. As 
regards those who were wounded, the statistics show a different result, 
namely : 43 were between twenty-five and thirty years, and 274 were 
between eighteen and twenty-five years." 

Surgeon Edward C. Bidwell, Massachusetts Volunteers, states 
that — 

" Growing boys of eighteen or nineteen years endured the vicissi- 
Testimony tudcs of camp-lifc better than men of thirty-five or forty 
Bidweu!°'^ ycars, and indeed as well as those of any age. Even in hard 
marches, as small a proportion of this class fell out as of those of more 
mature age." 

PERIOD OF SERVICE. 

With respect to the relation of the period of service to the 
power of endurance, and of resisting disease, the testimony, with- 
out exception, is in behalf of the superiority of veteran troops. 
The answers in full of eleven medical officers are subjoined. 

1. "Veterans have shown a greater power of endurance and been less 
Testimony subject to scorbutic and ataxic diseases. All ages and classes 
Gaiiou^^*!'^ endured well the vicissitudes of camp-life, and usually became 
of stronger physical conformation, provided they took the ordinary hy- 
gienic precautions. An exception is to be made of those who suffered 
from the depressing influence of home-sickness. This malady, which 
was quite common in the early history of regiments, prevailed most ex- 
tensively among those who were quite young and who had volunteered 
for service with scarcely an idea of what a soldier's life was to be." ^ 

2. " Soldiers of two years' experience, in sound health, can perform 
Testimony 50 per ceut. more service than new troops. The longer the 
jewetT°^ march the more the former proved superior to the latter in 
physical endurance. New troops in active service seem to have a vague

course of two years the weak and debilitated have been taken from the

5. " One veteran of two years' service is worth three raw Testimony 
recruits for immediate active service. One year of active ristant^sur-^' 
campaigning, however, is nearly as good as two years." * geon Powers. 

6. " Veterans did better than soldiers of less than two years' Testimony

7. " After one year of active campaigning the soldier's capacity to 
endure fatigue is at its maximum ; he has learned how to take Testimony 
care of himself, and his energies are still fresh for the en- Manfred. 
durance of hardships. At the end of three years of active campaigning, 
he is generally either worn out or heartily tired of the service ; in either 
case he is practically unfit for active field service." ^ 

8. " The percentage is largely in favor of the veteran, not more from 
the habit of exposure and schooled resistance of his organs, Testimony 
than from the fact that he takes better care of his person. Everts.

the examining surgeon. It follows that the veteran is, pari passu, the

any influence of seasons, locality, altitude, or latitude, or to severe and 
hard marching, — for that the regiment had during 1863 and 1864, — 
but rather to inurement and adaptation for physical endurance, ac- 
quired by a year or more experience in the service."

SEASON, CLIMATE, AND LOCALITY. 

Under this head are embraced those mfluences which are inde- 
pendent of malaria or any special causes (endemic or epidemic) 
of disease. Irrespective of these causes, which will be considered 
subsequently, the following statements respecting the relation of

cult to estimate the mfluences pertainmg to ' seasons, locah- Everts, 
ties, altitude,' etc., disconnected from other associated influences. The 
transfer of the army from the Potomac to the James in 1862, involved 
a transition from a school of instruction to actual service, — from winter- 
quarters to active campaigning, — so that the influences of season and 
climate cannot be separated from those of diet, labor, exposure, and the 
moral impressions incident to battle and duties ' at the front,' and these 
influences are very great. Soldiers will endure more and resist disease 
better, in the latitude of Virginia, late in the season than in early spring 
or midsummer. They bore better marching toward the north than 
toward the south, although under more discouraging circumstances in a 
nrihtary point of view. A humid condition of the atmosphere succeed- 
ing a dry period, during a march, was always beneficial — relieving the 
ambulance train." *

was made slowly. One most pernicious practice was pursued in the 
quartermaster's department everywhere, so far as my observation ex- 
tended. I allude to overcrowding steamboats with men, horses, wagons, 
and all the material of war, to such an extent that comfortable positions 
for rest and sleep often could not be obtained. I will cite an instance : — 
In Gen. Sherman's campaign against Vicksburg, in December, 1862, the 
22d Kentucky Infantry, the 54th Indiana Infantry, and a Wisconsin 
battery (Capt. Foster's), were all shipped on one boat (the Crescent 
City). More than fifteen hundred men, with all their camp equipage, 
horses, mules, etc., were huddled on this boat, where they remained 
more than two weeks. The boat became extremely filthy, and a low 
form of fever, complicated with erysipelas, prevailed in both regiments. 
Each regiment was engaged in the assault on Chickasaw Bluff, and each 
suffered severely in killed and wounded on that occasion ; but the con- 
finement on that boat led to a greater number of deaths in these regi- 
ments than the shot and shell of the enemy in the assault." ^ 

RESIDENCE IN CITY OR COUNTRY PRIOR TO ENLISTMENT, AND THE 
INFLUENCE OF PREVIOUS HABITS OF LIFE. 

Several of the correspondents of the Commission testify to the 
superiority in endurance, and the power of resisting disease, of men 
from cities, as compared with those from the country. Surgeon 
Bailhache writes that — 

" The vicissitudes of camp-life are best sustained by those who have 
Testimony lived in citics and large towns ; farmers or countrymen are 
Bailhache. particularly liable to break down." 

Dr. H. Manfred states, — 

"The companies of my regiment which were recruited from cities, 
bore the vicissitudes and hardships incident to a soldier's life, much 
better than the stalwart men brought up on farms." 

Surgeon B. F. Stevenson says, — 

" Men raised in towns and cities, as I always thought, without refer- 
Testimony eucc to fatigue, borc best the vicissitudes of the camp. They 
Stevenson, are morc cosmopolitan in habit, thought, and feeling, and they 
were much less subject to home-sickness." 

Surgeon A. W. Heise, Illinois Volunteers, makes the following 
statement : — 

" The lower classes from large cities surpassed all others in power of 
Testimony of endurance, and of adaptation to the vicissitudes of camp-life. 
Heij^e. Even those of sedentary occupations from the cities were bet- 

•ter able to bear these vicissitudes than laboring men, of rude health, 
from agricultural districts."

ACTIVITY OF RECRUITING IN 1862. 101 

Surgeon A. L. Clark, Illinois Volunteers, states that — 
" Young men of previous irregular habits coming from cities or towns 
endured the hardships of service better than flirmers who ap- Testimony of 
parently had a better physical organization." cilK°^ 

Professor Paul F. Eve, Confederate Surgeon, gives similar testi- 
mony, as regards the soldiers of the Southern armies, in the follow- 
ing language : — 

" To the question, ' AVhat classes of men best endured the vicissitudes 
of camp-life?' I reply that, greatly to the surprise of all, 
townsmen contrasted favorably with countrymen. But one Professor 
opinion exists on this point, though contrary to general belief 
The volunteers from cities and towns, the mechanics, clerks, store-keep- 
ers, professional men, etc., bore exposure in the field better than farmers, 
day-laborers, or even woodsmen. The difference may be attributed to 
these facts : Townsmen have generally passed through the usual in- 
fantile diseases which are so prevalent in camp ; they are somewhat ac- 
customed to irregularities in living ; they were better provided for the 
service, and they knew more of the ways of the world. I think it may 
with truth be stated in support of this position that, at the organization 
of the army, one town regiment was more efficient than two or even 
three from the country. In one company from Nashville there were 
seven youths under seventeen years of age, six of whom passed through 
the war and are now in excellent health. It was noticed everywhere 
that the more intelligent the recruit or soldier, the better he fared in the 
field and bore the vicissitudes of camp-life."

urge young and old into the field. On the call made July 2, 1862, 
for 300,000 volunteers, 419,627 were actually mustered into ser- 
vice. So far from effort to secure recruits being necessary, it re- 
quired absolute firmness and integrity on the part of the examining 
surgeon to reject the unworthy. I have seen tears shed by young 
men rejected on account of varicocele and slight hernia, and have 
been offered bribes as an inducement to accept them. All argu- 
ments were offered, and a too-ready yielding to them on the part 
of examiners very much embarrassed the service for a year suc- 
ceeding.

102 FARMERS AND LABORERS FOR THE ARMY. 

On tlie 9t.li of August, 1862, I reported at Bingliamj)ton, N. Y.,

cruits at its Organization. A partial reexamination oi those ah'eady 
tou, N. Y. accepted, and of several hundred more who offered (two 
regiments of 1000 men each were raised), resulted in my rejecting 
about 26 per cent, of all candidates. As only a few days were oc- 
cupied in this work, it was done hurriedly, in this wise : The men 
reported by companies and often had 120 men to the company. 
They were marched into a large hall, and sometimes a part, 
sometimes the whole of the company directed to strip to nudity at 
once. Commencing at the head of the line, each man was rapidly 
examined. First, his head was felt for scalp-wounds, and the coun- 
tenance scanned for any epileptic look. Hearing was tested by 
questions asked in a low voice ; sight by visual examination and by 
questions as to objects at a distance. The mouth and teeth were 
then inspected, a general look given to the physique, front and 
rear, the genital organs examined for hernia or varicocele, the fun- 
dament for hemori'hoids, and the candidate was then tested gym- 
nastically. He was told to strike first the palms and then the 
backs of his hands together perpendicularly over the head ; and 
then to place the palm of the hand on the corresponding shoulder, 
keeping the elbow flat against the side. He was also directed to 
strike his heel sharply against the nates. Respiration and circula- 
tion were then examined, and a more careful look given to fingers 
and toes. Such an examination occupied hardly more than one 
minute per man, but as no time was lost in waiting for individuals 
to undress a great deal of business could be done with tolerable 
care. 

The material was mostly of young farmers and laborers, of fine 
Farmers and physiquc, elegantly rounded forms, and soft and supple 
fromThe sldus. No better class ever offered themselves to an ex- 
mrSifor amining surgeon, yet as I have mentioned, only 74 per 
the army. cent, wcrc fouud fit for enlistment. The fault in this 
body of men became evident immediately. They had been ten- 
derly nurtured in homes of comfort. To lose a meal or sit down 
to a poor one was a hardship few had experienced. Up at an 
early hour, the duties of the farm-yard had busied them for an 
hour before the substantial breakfast of the New York farmer. 
If the weather were fair they " plowed a-field ; " if rainy, lounged 
about the house, the neighboring " store," or worked at repairs 
under shelter, until, the three regular meals completed, they went 
to their feather-beds at nine o'clock in the evening to dreamless and

healthy sleep. It is fair to say that many of them had rarely lost 
a night's rest, or suffered a wetting from rain, in the even tenor of 
their monotonous and gentle lives. 

Such is not the best material for ready conversion into soldiers. 
The city youth, who has "run with the machine," dissipated whole 
nio-hts at frequent intervals without rest the next day, Young men

hardships of the first campaign, and maintain through all the spirit 
of the laughing philosopher. On the other hand the quiet farmer's 
son no sooner finds himself packed in an A tent mth too numerous 
companions, and compelled to cook his own food, than he longs for 
the feather-beds and the flesh-pots of the old homestead. 

Physically, too, he is for the time the inferior. His muscles 
have more development than training. All his life a lounger, in- 
dulging in the American luxury of one chair for his person and 
ano'her for his heels, never assuming the absolutely erect position 
except momentarily, always resting himself by frequent changes 
of attitude, it is really a severe trial for his nervous system to 
" stand at attention." This shows itself in fi'equent syncope at 
dress parade. Standing erect, facing the declining sun, it is a very 
common thing for the rural recruit to find his head reeling until he 
astonishes the adjutant by falling prostrate and insensible. Again, 
he cannot bear hard exercise in the morning. I have known about 
ten per cent, of a company faint or break down at a drill on an 
empty stomach directly after reveille. 

Yet the essentials of a splendid soldiery are all here. Morally, 
they require a more gentle and friendly treatment fi'om Management

between the higher and lower ranks, ihis will not be country, 
abused if judiciously employed, and the necessity for it is found in 
the importance of sustaining the spirits of the men, who are very 
likely subjects for nostalgia. If they can feel that their patriotism 
is appreciated, that they are esteemed and valued by their offi- 
cers, they are too inteUigent, and as a class too honorable, to abuse 
the freedom of intercourse to which they are admitted. 

Physically, all depends upon their early handling. During the 
period of seasoning we should watch them carefully, and it is the 
sm^geon's duty to interpose authoritative advice as to the hours of 
drill and duty. Recollecting that these men are still " soft " in 
tissue, it is the height of imprudence to crush them with long

drills in heavy marching order. Some commands in the army of 
the Potomac literally " broke the hearts " of their men by laborious 
brigade drills with foil knapsacks. Of course in the production of 
the athletic condition, to which the soldier must come at last if he 
is to have any military value, these drills must necessarily be em- 
ployed. But all should be done gradually, so as to steadily inure 
the man to his work, day by day hardening his muscle and devel- 
oping his powers of endurance. In a few months, or even weeks, 
of wise gymnastic training, all the quiet growth of his early years 
becomes a source of reliable strength, fitting him for hardships and 
exposures. As to personal bravery he has no superior, when once 
he learns to sink his own intelligent individuality in the general 
mass of thought and action. He is, more than any other soldier, 
brave from principle and patriotism, meets wounds cheerfully, and 
dies with a clear-headed appreciation of what he is dying for. Such 
soldiers are inestimable, and the early faults they exhibit are easy 
of correction, in fact they are only a modification of excellence. In 
the particular body of recruits whom I have taken as my text, the 
subsequent history confirmed my opinions. The difficulties I have 
named presented themselves in due succession. I was fortunate 
in having intelligent and humane field officers, with whom I could 
consult, and who were willing to take my previous experience for 
at least as much as it was worth. We had been hardly a week in 
camp in Maryland before the measles attacked us, and we had 
nearly one hundred cases, closely followed by over one hundred 
cases of a simple continued fever of very mild character. Yet at 
the end of a year the regiment had lost by death from disease only 
five men out of 1020, and a very few more by discharge. Ever 
after I heard of it as a hardy, healthy, and very efficient regiment 
in the field. 

I think the superior marching qualities of western soldiers, as 
Superior Compared with the untrained eastern soldier, were due to 
qualities of prcvlous habits of life, the greater recklessness — or, to 
soldiers. usc a morc descriptive phrase, Bohemianism — of the 
western troops. They were more accustomed to roughing it, to 
indulging in the sports of the chase, and to vicissitudes of life 
which are rarely encountered in the thickly-settled and orderly 
East. This rendered them more available for immediate action, 
but in the end they manifested no superiority over that indomita- 
ble pertinacity which marked the army of the Potomac, alike in 
success or defeat. 



HEALTH ON THE "GREAT PLAINS." 105 

REMARKS BY SURGEON HUNT ON THE EFFECTS OF ALTITUDE. 

No meteorological law is better understood than that with in- 
creasing altitudes we find a lower temperature and a 
wider variation between the temperature and the dew- temperature 
point. That is, we have a cooler and drier atmosphere, point to a^u 
conditions always favorable to health, inasmuch as they fected'by. 
forbid the development of the various ferments that con- fouforma-"'^ 
stitute malaria, and have in themselves a specific tonic 
effect upon the human system. Mere altitude, however, may fail 
to produce these results, owing to the geographical conformation of 
the land ; as, for instance, a low, sheltered, mountain valley, un- 
ventilated and with an imperfect exposure to the sun, may have a 
high dew-point and be eminently malarial. All the conditions that 
create disease in alluvial districts may thus be sometimes found 
among rocky hills. 

On the other hand, it happens that prairies may sometimes com- 
bine all the essentials of health, even at a comparatively Health on 

. the " Great 

low altitude. Such is the fact in that slightly elevated Plains." 
plateau of prairie extending from the Rio Grande northwardly to 
the Canadian line, embracing much of Texas, the Indian Territory, 
Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, and which, growing broader as we 
go northward, extends westward to the foot of the Rocky Moun- 
tains or to the verge of the great American desert. This plateau 
is in some portion known as the " Great Plains," yet the savan- 
nas of the Indian Territory and the prairies of Texas are essen- 
tially parts of the same system, and governed by the same laws. 
It has an air inspiringly pure and bracing. Even in periods of 
great heat, there is none of that nervous exhaustion which attends 
a hot and humid atmosphere, and sun-stroke is an accident rarely 
known. The latter is said never to occur except in unventilated 
and thickly-timbered river bottoms. Physical energy, a restless 
tendency to nomadic life, and a keen appetite for adventure, are 
the characters imj>y^ssed upon the people by the brisk air they 
breathe, which has all the properties of the purest mountain air, 
except its rarity. It is a more condensed atmosphere, but equally 
dry and oxygenated. 

Yet this great natural sanitarium is comparatively low, as one 
may reason when he recollects that its rivers flow sluggishly, and 
for vast distances have no waterfalls. In periods of freshets, 
steamers may navigate the Arkansas to Fort Gibson, or the Mis- 
souri to a point nearly to the Rocky Mountains. The general level 



106 RECOKDS OF MARCHES. 

of the prairies of Texas, above the sea, is about 500 feet only, and 
so gradual is that slope that it is passed unconsciously, the traveller 
supposing himself on an interminable plain. Toward the north 
and the foot-hills of the west it rolls in grand yet gentle midula- 
tions, its hills segregated and rarely assuming the form of ranges, 
and when they do, lying north and south so as to oppose no ob- 
stacle to the steady flow of the return-trade-wind, which is there 
almost due southerly in its course — a steadfast breath from Paradise 
flowing through happy hunting-grounds. Few men of Atlantic 
origin have any conception of the marvelous beauty of the eastern 
border of the great plains, or of the wonderful salubrity of their 
climate. The traveller from some slight eminence sees before him 
one vast undulating ocean of grass waving in the wind like ripening 
barley, until its rollings are lost in the soft, yellow haze of the 
horizon. At intervals a belt of timber marks a water-course, and 
here and there are strangely-shaped hills of varied formation, flat 
topped and geometrical, sometimes crowned with equally symmet- 
rical turrets, and having a strildng resemblance to the monitor class 
of ships. Fat herds of cattle graze contentedly and people the 
soHtudes, the quail hops along the trail before you hke a dove in the 
streets of a town, the turkey-hen fussily hovers her brood out of 
harm's way, or the prairie-chicken starts up with vigorous wing ; 
while over all bends a sky of deepest purity, so clear that at night 
the stars swing out like lamps, as if set upon the inner surface of 
the dome and not buried in the measureless distances beyond. 

A few records of marches will illustrate the effect of this climate 
upon the efficiency of troops. In September of 1864, Colonel James

of troops. noon he received orders to make a forced march on (jrib- 
son. The route crosses one of the rocky and mountainous ranges 
just east of the inter-continental plateau, and was so rough and 
stony that, on reaching Fort Gibson at about 9 a. m. the next day, 
a large proportion of the troops — all negroes — had blistered their 
feet or worn out their shoes. A surgeon's examination, however, 
only excused eleven men out of the 1200 present, and at 7 p. m. 
the march was renewed, pushed on through the night upon the 
open prairie, with short halts, until at noon the next day the entire 
command, without a single straggler, went into line of battle on 
Pryor's Creek — a distance of forty-two miles marched in just 
seventeen hours ; or, taking the entire march from the Salisoe, of 



i 



RECORDS OF MARCHES. 107 

seventy-eight miles marched in something less than forty-eiglit 
hours. At sick-call the next morning only four men presented 
themselves, and nowhere in the command were there the usual 
evidences of a forced march through night and day. All felt 
exhilarated, and the contrast with marches in humid districts was 
very prominent. 

Later in the same season the 54th U. S. Colored Infantry, Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Fair commanding, repeated this march on a more 
leisurely but extended scale. They passed some four weeks of 
November and December upon the plains between Fort Gibson 
and Fort Scott, without tents for officers or men, experiencing 
several snow-storms and much severe, cold weather; yet they 
returned not only without deaths from disease, but remarkably free 
from pulmonic or rheumatic complaints. 

Another march, in part through malarial and in part through 
prairie regions, affords a striking illustration of climatic influences. 
Early in July, 1865, Major-General Wesley Merritt left Shreve- 
port. La., for San Antonio, Texas, with a full division of cavahy. 
The division had been some weeks in the oppressively hot and 
humid valley of the Red River, and its health was already shaken. 
From the Red River to the Brazos is a timbered country, pine 
barrens or post oak, alternating with rich alluvial bottoms. The 
country is quite hilly, yet everywhere malarial. The roads 
were narrow and extremely hot and breathless. A regiment 
(18th New York Cavalry) preceded the column to provide forage 
depots. On the march from Shreveport to Marshall, Texas, — a 
distance of only sixty miles, — it lost by sun-stroke, congestive chill, 
or other zymotic causes, eight men. Subsequently, by more pru- 
dent marching and avoiding the midday heats, the mortality 
ceased. The main column was marched with great piTidence from 
the outset ; but cases of fever constantly occurred, and were 
packed along in the ambulances. The command may be said to 
have been very sickly on reaching the Brazos. 

Arrived there, the route led out upon the open prairie, over 
which swept continuously the strong southerly wind, blowing 
night and day. The heat was intense, the thermometer ranging 
very high, but w^ithal there was no languor. The sick in the 
ambulances recovered, few new cases occurred, and the command 
reached San Antonio on the 1st of August in remarkable healtli, 
which was well maintained thereafter. Here we came off the 
highlands, which were sickly, down on to the lowland prairie, 
which per contra was as healthful as any part of the world, and 
that in a temperature averaging 90° for each twenty-four hours. 



108 REMARKS OF SURGEON ABBOTT. 

The causes that determine this local climate must be looked for 
in its physical geography. The region of which we are speaking 
lies somewhat to the western border of the "normal south-west 
wind," or rain-bearing wind. This moisture-laden air-current 
gives its greatest precipitation in the region of the Mississippi 
Valley. As we pass to the westward we are still in the same air- 
current, governed, as in the valley, by the diurnal motion of the 
earth, and flowing steadily northward ; but it is not so moisture- 
laden, inasmuch as its major portion has passed over but a little of 
the Gulf of Mexico, and has absorbed but little water. And as 
we go westward we find the annual precipitation decreasing until 
it reaches its minimum in the arid wastes of the Great Central 
Desert. It is in the interval between the humid valley of the 
Mississippi and its immediate tributaries, and the sand deserts that 
skirt the Rocky Mountains, that we find this happy combination of 
a warm climate and an invigorating air — of almost tropical heats 
with delightful breezes. 

ALIMENTATION, AND THE USE OF COFFEE AND TEA. 

Army alimentation has already been considered in a chapter de- 
voted to that subject (Chap. iii.). It will claim further considera- 
tion as connected with the causation and management of certain 
diseases, especially scurvy. A thrilling account of the effects of 
innutrition dependent on deficiency of alimentation, as exemplified 
in the Andersonville prison, will appear in a subsequent section. 
In this chapter, under the head of alimentation, will be quoted re- 
marks by some of the correspondents of the Commission, in reply 
to the following questions contained in the Circular : " What effects 
have followed deficiency in quality or quantity of rations ? " " At 
what times and to what extent was there such deficiency?" 
" Have you observed any special advantage from food and bev- 
erage partaken warm after fatigue ? " The small amount of testi- 
mony to a deficiency of rations is significant of the abundance of 
ahmentary supplies ; and to the hberality of the commissariat, as 
well as to the efficiency of the cooperative efforts of the Sanitary 
Commission, there is no lack of direct testimony. 

Surgeon Samuel W. Abbott, of Mass., who served two and a 
half years as assistant-surgeon in the navy, and afterward as assist- 
ant-surgeon and surgeon in the army of the Potomac, writes, re- 
specting rations, as follows : — 

" Those of the navy, especially in squadrons within a few days' sail of 
Remarks of northern ports, were better and more varied during the war 
Abbott. than those of the army. I have observed, while in the navy, 



REMAEKS OF SURGEON ABBOTT. 109 

scarcely any ill effects from deficiency either in quality or quantity. I 
know that the ' preserved roast meat,' in large cans, was a miserable 
article, often unfit to eat, and productive of diarrhoea. While in the 
army near Petersburg, during the winter months of 1864-65, there was 
a great deficiency of fresh vegetables. The weekly sick report of the 
various regiments in my brigade, showed a lamentable want of potatoes 
and onions. Only one or two rations of potatoes were received for 
three or four months. I did not, however, at that time, notice ill effects. 
Two or three cases of scurvy occurred in my regiment, of about 400 
men, and but a few cases in the whole brigade. I have no doubt that 
the effect on the health of the soldiers, during the ensuing season, 
would have been very injurious had there been an active campaign in 
the summer. Deficiency in quantity was of rare occurrence. It was 
only once complained of during the winter of 18G4-65 in my command. 
Soft bread, onions, cabbages, and potatoes, when issued, were eagerly 
partaken of by the men. They would often throw away fresh beef, but 
almost never ' hard tack.' The latter would be just as good after a 
week's marching as at first. I think the hard bread of both arms of 
the service is the most us^ul, available, and nutritious part of the ration 
for men in active service. Several rations of desiccated mixed vegeta- 
bles were issued during the winter, which, when boiled and made into 
soup, were very palatable. 

*' One source of disease among soldiers in active service, is in the fact 
that every man cooks for himself. Now, all soldiers are not good cooks. 
Hence, a great amount of neglect, waste of food, and filthy habits of 
cooking. I could not but notice the difference between soldiers and 
seamen in this respect, and in many instances it could not be avoided. 
One of the most common utensils used in the army was the frying-pan, 
which was very convenient, but oflen very dirty, being frequently laid 
aside with the accumulated filth and grease of several weeks. In my 
own regiment and brigade, I made special inspections of this article, and 
recommended, as far as possible, the substitution of gridirons made of 
old telegraph wire, easily obtained along the deserted railroads leading 
from Petersburg. When in winter-quarters several companies had 
cook-houses, from which good soups were frequently furnished to the 
men. But picket and other detached duty interfered much with such 
arrangements. In the naval service, on the contrary, every ship has 
one man, often a professional cook, who prepares the food for all 
the crew, divided into messes, each provided with separate mess- 
chest and utensils. Among the varied commutations of the naval 
ration, tomatoes in cans formed an excellent part ; they were almost 
invariably in good condition. Bean or pea soup, as served in most 
men of war, was a very nutritious and palatable article, as the officer of 
the deck could often testify at 'seven bells' in the forenoon watch. 
Flour was commonly boiled in the form of ' duflf.' Fresh beef was sup-

plied to the South Atlantic Squadron every three weeks. Tt was 
eagerly eaten by the men, but frequently productive of diarrhoea on 
account of the sudden change from salt food, and also on account of 
the unusual quantity eaten. 

'' In regard to warm and cold food and beverages, I have not made any 
special observation, but I should think the former had a better effect 
on body and mind. I have never known men to take their coffee cold. 
I have found the most available nutriment after battle to be coffee, 
condensed milk, hard tack, and extract of beef, carried in the med- 
ical wagons and ambulances. The extract of beef furnished an excel- 
lent soup when made with such vegetables as could be obtained by 
foraging in the vicinity. Frequently hot coffee, boiled farina, and milk 
punch, as furnished by the Sanitary and the Christian Conunission, have 
been most acceptable ; and I shall never forget the gratitude manifested 
by our men when these articles were so kindly furnished by the agents 
of the Sanitary Commission, at the battle of Hatcher's Run, in Feb- 
ruary, 1865." 

Surgeon B. F. Stevenson bears testimony to the evils of over- 
feeding and the comparative immunity from sickness, under tem- 
porary dietetic restrictions, in the following quotation : — 

" Deficiency in the quantity of the rations T never witnessed. On the 

contrary, I have observed but too frequently the injurious re-

ande^t'of nutrient material than one man ought ever to consinne in a 
di™tl't°irre- Single day. On the retreat from Cumberland Gap, in Sep- 
strictions. tember and October, 1862, the troops were on shorter allow- 
ance than at any previous or subsequent period of my connection with 
the army ; and notwithstanding the depressing effect of a retreat, sur- 
rounded and harassed by an exultant and confident enemy, I should 
select this period as exhibiting a smaller daily sick-list in my regiment, 
than any period of equal duration whilst I was in the service. The 
commutation of the regular ration which I would suggest, is the sub- 
stitution of canned and dried fruits or vegetables, and also green veg- 
etables, when these can be procured, together with a large increase of 
the sugar ration. Of salt meats, I think beef can be dispensed with 
better than pork. 

" Food and beverages taken warm after a hard march, or after ex- 
warm food posure to cold ou picket duty, I always found more invigor- 
^es. ^^^^ ating than when taken cold. After a hard march I have 
often found a cup of strong, warm coffee or tea reinspire soldiers with 
a determination to press on and accomplish a given work which they 
had almost despaired to accomplish." 

Testimony analogous to the preceding is given by Surgeon E. 
Batwell, as follows : — 



TESTIMONY OF SURGEONS. Ill 

" It has never been my fortune to see ill effects from deficiency of 
rations. During the time that the garrison at Nashville was Testimony 
closely besieged, and were on quarter rations, having to col- BatweT°° 
lect the rations at the point of the bayonet, a condition of good health 
existed among the men not equaled before or afterward ; the hospitals 
had only old chronic cases. Again at Chattanooga, after the battle 
of Chickaraauga, when the immense army of Rosecrans depended 
for supplies on the almost impassable road over Waldron Ridge, when 
the mules and horses died from starvation, and when it was not un- 
common to see our noble, uncomplaining soldiers pick up and parch 
for their own use the kernels of corn scattered by the mules, one 
would have supposed that sickness would prevail ; but the reports of 
the divisions, corps, and regiments showed the reverse. We do not 
regard short rations as necessary for the health of the soldier, but we 
do say that the army of the Southwest was never in such a high condi- 
tion of health as when the full ration was not furnished. At Camp Big 
Springs, where there was a lavish distribution of the full army ration, 
the Sanitary Commission filling up with delicacies and luxuries every 
chink that might be left, one might imagine that the ' palmy days ' of 
soldiery would furnish a small sick-list. Yet I venture to say that a 
larger nupiber of men were prostrated by disease, under these circum- 
stances, than before or afterward. 

" No one who has experienced the refreshing effect of a cup of good, 
hot coffee, at ' noon-halt,' can doubt its beneficial result. It Refreshing 
supplies a want that nothing else fills. Every one must have coffee. 
observed on a march the amount of water drank by the men. Some, 
however, seldom drink from breakfast to dinner-time, and that too when 
marching under a broiling sun. At dinner-time they get their cup of 
coffee, and drink it with that relish which no one but a soldier can fully 
understand ; whereas, they who rush to every well or spring are too 
full to enjoy their meal, and they are those who ' drop out' in the after- 
noon march, while their companions (who are not water-logged) come 
into camp with an elastic step, so characteristic of ' Sherman's boys.' 
Beef soup, made from the extract, and thickened with grated hard-tack 
or farina, was the most available nutriment on the field." 

Surgeon Samuel A. Green, 24th Massachusetts Volunteers, writes 
respecting the want of a proper system of cooking, as follows : — 

" In regard to alimentation, I have always found the ration remark- 
ably generous in quantity and good in quality. Never was Remarks by 
an army so bountifully supplied with every article of food Gr^n. 
that loyal hearts could wish, and yet something was wanting. The great 
difficulty has always been, a want of proper preparation of the food. 
While the cooks did their best, many were inexperienced in their duties, 
and ignorant of some of the first principles of their art. They were 



112 TESTIMONY OP SURGEONS. 

detailed from the ranks, and it was not to be expected that they could 
do better. To be a good cook requires a certain kind of knowledge to 
be acquired by education, otherwise the food will be improperly pre- 
pared. At times the nutrient elements will be wasted, and then again, 
the food will be so altered as to be positively hurtful, if the cook does 
not understand his business. It is true that the cooks have to work as 
they best can under great disadvantages ; that on a march they have but 
an iron pail or two in the way of utensils. It is not so much with them 
that I find fault, as with the system which tolerates them. In garrison 
or in winter-quarters, the same want of method is seen. Desiccated 
vegetables were generally furnished troops stationed in a place with any 
likelihood of permanence. With these a very excellent soup might be 
made on ' fresh-meat days,' and yet this was rarely done. Instead of 
this the soluble part of the meat was lost in the water, and the water 
thrown away. This waste was seen in every thing in the cook's depart- 
ment. Some allowance is to be made for the American taste. Soups 
are, to a certain extent, in opposition to the genius of the American 
people. It is not so with the French, who understand these things bet- 
ter. A French soldier would make a good dinner of this very soup, if 
he had bread and a little red wine, whereas an American would not 
look at it, but must have the meat. I do not mean that the diet of the 
two countries should be the same, but I do think that we might take 
a hint from the French. With our more invigorating climate, we 
need solid animal food more than European nations. We consider 
meat a necessity rather than a luxury. If this be true in civil life, it 
holds good a fortiori in the army. 

" The life of a soldier is peculiar. It is one of extremes. Never in 
civil life is there such a demand for mere force or muscular power, fol- 
lowed immediately by the opposite extreme. To-day it is storming a 
breastwork, or charging a battery, and to-morrow doing nothing. It is 
this life which wears and tears the soldier, and the waste must be sup- 
plied in order to keep him whole. This is to be done by a careful at- 
tention to his food. The great want of the army is food prepared more 
scientifically than at present." 

Surgeon Edwin C. Bidwell thus bears testimony to the utility of 
coffee and of warm food and beverages : — 

"I have had but little experience with troops upon short rations, 
Testimony nonc, in fact, except for very brief periods, too brief to give 
Bidwell re- risc to any lasting ill effects. In cases of fatigue, either with 

Bpecting coflfce . o ^ 

and warm or without a Sufficient diet, I have always found hot coffee a 
leverages, vcry Valuable restorative. So strongly impressed was I, as 
respects the value of this article in the field, from my own experience, 
as well as observation of its effects on others, that I was accustomed to 
call coffee the ' staff of life.' I am sure that warm food and drinks have 
an especial advantage after fatigue." 



THE WHISKY RATION. 113 

Assistant-Surgeon John Whittaker, Ohio Volunteers, communi- 
cates the following statement respecting the use of tea : — 

" Previous to, and during the investment of, Atlanta, the duty was so 
hard that a great many of the men broke down. From con- statement

from exposure to balls and shell for weeks at a time, together with poor 
diet, great numbers came on the sick-list ; many of these not appearing 
to suffer from any particular disease, but simply ' worn out.' In these 
cases tea was found to be a valuable restorative. With rest and plenty 
of good tea they generally recovered rapidly." 

Surgeon Charles Southworth, 18th Michigan Volunteers, says, 
with regard to the use of coffee : — 

" I would recommend the use of coffee instead of whisky. I believe 

coftee, used freely by the soldier on picket, during a march, Testimony 

on the battle-field, or when engaged in any fatiguing duty, is Southworth 

not only a prophylactic but a healthful stimulant, such as is re- cofifee. 
quired by the nervous system under these circumstances.*' 



THE WHISKY RATION. 

The use of whisky is to be here considered with reference only 
to the effect of an alcoholic stimulant on endurance and the power 
of resisting disease, not as a therapeutic agent. Does alcohol en- 
able the soldier to bear better the exposure, exertions, and fatigues 
to which he is liable in the field, and does it exert an influence as 
a prophylactic ? The statements of medical officers from whom 
reports have been received, do not all agree respecting the answer 
to this question. The great majority, however, are of opinion that 
the issuing of a whisky ration, as a rule, is injurious instead of 
being useful ; but some hold to the belief that spirit may be given 
with advantage on occasions when the physical powers are unu- 
sually taxed, and that some feeble persons may do better with than 
without it. There are certain moral considerations connected with 
the issuing of a whisky ration which cannot be easily disconnected 
fi'om the purely physiological and etiological aspects of the topic. 
Here, as under the other heads which this chapter embraces, the 
testimony of those who have responded to the Circular will be sub- 
mitted. In addition to opinions, the reports of some of the cor- 
respondents of the Commission contain facts of importance as 
bearing on this topic. To the following series of extracts the 
names of the writers, respectively, are appended: — 



114 STATEMENTS OF SURGEONS.

opinion. tigumg cxcrtion, exposure to cold, or while campuig on marshy 
ground, I have not found its regular free use advisable. The evil moral 
influence which the common use of it exerts over an army or regiment 
far overbalances any good effect even of its occasional proper use. Some 
who never drank spirits before acquire the habit of drinking or a taste 
for liquor from its being issued as a ration. I made trial of its use, as a 
ration, at one time for several weeks, by order of the medical director, 
and I can truly say that remittent fever, intermittent fever, diarrhoea, 
and dysentery, were not in the least prevented, nor was the physical 
strength of the men perceptibly sustained." ^ 

2. " In regard to the ' whisky ration,' I have doubts concerning its 
Opinion of benefits. Perhaps my doubts are based on moral rather than

life, but away from temptation the craving for liquor is not felt. Doling 
it out at irregular intervals as a ration keeps up the appetite in these 
men, creates an appetite in others, and it is questionable in my mind 
whether it does any good. Whisky should be confined to the hospital, 
where it can be used freely at times with much benefit, if given with 
discretion." ^ 

3. " The impressions left upon my mind by observation respecting the 
Opinion of whisky ratiou, are that it does not promote the ability of the

ability to resist disease. It would be difficult to show this by figures — 
statistics — derived from morning reports, etc., (which every army sur- 
geon knows to be often nearly worthless, if not deceptive,) because it is 
difficult to determine the value of any single influence among the many 
influences tending to increase or decrease the sick-report. 1 found the 
whisky ration in vogue and very popular when I joined the army of 
the Potomac in the Chickahominy Swamp early in June, 1862. It was 
given as a prophylactic against malaria. Quinine, which was at first 
ordered with it, did not come into general use. But so far from the 
malarious manifestations being prevented, they were on the increase 
among the troops ; and so strongly was I led to suspect that the opera- 
tion of malaria was aided by the whisky that I induced' the Colonel 
commanding my regiment to destroy it instead of giving it to the men. 
This was done, until some three weeks afterward a general conviction 
led to the suspension of the whisky ration, or to its being issued only 
by special order after ' fatigue duty.' There was no increase of fever 
certainly after the whisky was withdrawn, notwithstanding the advance 
of the season to a period more productive of malaria, and an increased 
amount of the physical exertion of the army in defending its position 
and changing its base." ^

4. " When the army of Rosecrans lay about Nashville, I had a fair 
ihance of testing the effect of the indiscriminate use of statements 
whisky among troops, and of proving satisfactorily to my own BatweT"" 
mind that it is productive of evil. Four regiments were similarly situ- 
ated around Fort Hegley, using the same water, similar rations, and in 
every way living as nearly alike as possible, except that two of the regi- 
ments had whisky freely distributed. In the latter regiments if a man 
felt cold he got * a horn ' to warm him ; if he felt hot or feverish he got 
the same to make him ' throw off the fever ; ' and so things went on. 
Consequently the surgeons of these regiments were lauded to the sky, 
while those of the other commands were abused both by officers and 
men. The monthly report of sick, however, showed a condition of 
affairs very prejudicial to the use of whisky. Each of the regiments 
in which it was so profusely used had a larger number of sick than both 
the two other regiments. Again, at Camp Big Springs, near Corinth, 
Miss., two Michigan regiments lay side by side, endured the same expo- 
sure, and had an equal number of men when they reached Pittsburg 
Landing. In one of these regiments whisky was used freely by both 
officers and men, and in the other regiment the contrary practice was 
inculcated and carried out. Sickness and death prevailed among both 
regiments, but at the end of June, 1862, there were less than two hun- 
dred for duty in the former regiment, whereas in the latter over five 
hundred men appeared on the morning report as fit for duty. I have 
thus endeavored to set forth statistically the grounds for my not favoring 
the ' whisky ration.' " ^

endure prolonged hardship, and have recovered with more Testimony 
difficulty when sick or wounded. In emergencies, however, oaiioupe. 
when it has been desirable to obtain a great amount of service in a short

list is increased by it. I do not say that were it properly used opiJiion. 
under certain circumstances and with proper restrictions, it might not be 
beneficial, but, as it has been used under my observation, it has proved 
injurious. I think that all alcoholic stimulants should be prohibited ex- 
cept as a medicine, and supplied only through the medical department, 
the medical officers being held strictly responsible for their proper use." ^

pairs the digestive functions and reduces the power of physical endur-

than in civil life." ^

names in this connection. Suffice it to say, that whilst many discoun- 
tenance in toto the use of the article either in camp, on the march, 
or in hospital, the majority of the surgeons with M'hora I have con- 
versed prefer to have a moderate supply always at hand and subject to 
their order. It is undoubtedly valuable as an adjunct to the armament 
of the medical officer in many cases, and sometimes indispensable ; yet 
the doubt has often been expressed by the most thoughtful, whether, on 
the whole, it has not been productive of more evil than good even in 
the hospital. For men after exhausting marches, or severe duty of 
any kind, it would be undoubtedly often very useful, were it not that

of effects does not consist of two cognate but independent poisons.

tion of this topic is here appropriate, in so far as facts may tend to elucidate the influence 
of malaria on physical endurance and the resistance to disease. The effects which malaria 
produces without producing fever are alone to be considered in this section of the medical 
volume; the consideration of fevers attributable to malaria belongs to section second, which 
is devoted to special pathology. A considerable number of the correspondents of the Sani- 
tary Commission bear testimony to the influence of malaria upon physical endurance and 
the resistance of disease, corroborating the views which are more fully set forth by Dr. Bar- 



II 



ACTION OF MALARIA IRRESPECTIVE OF FEVER. 119 

In regions where malaria is greatly rife, intermittent and remittent 
fevers are the common and obvious forms, varying greatly in se- 
verity, yet conforming to the type, but there are also various anom- 
alous affections which may or may not be periodical. The distinc- 
tion between these two forms of poison, or, if it may be preferred, 
two varieties in its mode of manifestation, is further shown in the 
action of the antidote quinia, which is much more efficacious in 
the regular than in the anomalous forms of malarious diseases. 
The question of the probably essential differences between these 
two forms can hardly be considered in the present state of our 
knowledge, much less definitely settled. There are, however, 
abundant reasons for believing that the gradual and long-continued 
absorption of malaria produces a series of phenomena clearly sep- 
arable from those produced by the sudden saturation of the blood 
by the poison. 

Every one accustomed to observe soldiers in our army must have 
seen those who, exposed to malaria, never suffered from j^^^^^^ ^f 
the typical malarious diseases, or, in other words, never "esiectwe" 
experienced any febrile movement induced by malaria, ^^^^''^'• 
but whose whole organism manifested clearly enough the long-con- 
tinued action of the poison. A similar condition of the interior 
and exterior organs of the body may be induced by attacks of in- 
termittent malarious fever, the poison acting continuously in the 
interim without febrile phenomena. 

The gradual changes in glandular organs, in the blood, in the 
nervous centres, are those which are chiefly comprehended in ques- 
tions 6 and 14,^ but they must be studied from both points of view. 

It will be proper then to consider, in the first place, the effects of 
a malarious atmosphere upon the physical endurance of men with- 
out the production of fever, and, in the second place, the agency 
of malarial poisoning upon the diseases and the results of surgery 
in the war, which includes both the gradual absorption of malaria 
without febrile phenomena, the anomalous, and the regular forms 
of malarious diseases.

ions -which have been received. Dr. Bartholow's contribution Avas made in answer to the fol- 
lowing inquiries contained in the Circular issued by the Medical Committee of the Sanitary 
Commission: " Have you observed any facts that show in what manner and to what degree 
a malarious atmosphere affects the physical endurance of men without inducing fever?" 
" What evidences have you observed of the agency of malarial poisoning upon diseases and 
the results of surgery in the war ? " " Please to state facts respecting the relation of mala-

120 VARIATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF THE POISON. 



I. 

IN WHAT MANNER AND TO WHAT DEGREE A MALARIOUS ATMOSPHERE 
AFFECTS THE PHYSICAL ENDURANCE OF MEN WITHOUT INDUCING 
FEVER. 

This inquiry is involved in more or less difficulty, because it is 
Basis of the not alwajs possible to separate the influences of change in 
serrations, the Hiode and conditions of life, and the effects of con- 
stitutional vices, from the influences of malaria. Cases involving 
other agencies than malaria have been excluded from these obser- 
vations, which are based upon experiences with troops, and upon 
forty autopsies made at Chattanooga and Nashville, chiefly the 
former. 

The gradual absorption of malaria, without the production of 
febrile phenomena, may occur under three conditions : — 
Conditions The poisou not intense ; 
Thelraduai^ The orgauism not susceptible ; 

malaria*^'' °^ Malaria abundant, but hygienic circumstances imfavor- 
occurs. g^^Q ^^ i^g speedy absorption. 

To variations in the intensity of the poison may be ascribed the 
Variations cffccts which I havc attributed to slow imbibition, or to 
sity^oVSr" differences in its essential nature. The intensity of the 
poison. poison varies with the locality and with special telluric 
influences ; but it is also greatly affected by population. A small 
party in a malarious district will suffer more than an army, a small 
army more than a large one, an isolated farm-house more than a vil- 
lage, a village more than a city. This variation in the intensity of 
the poison is exhibited in the great changes of type which malarious 
diseases undergo where the populations increase : intermittents and 
remittents gradually disappear ; they are supplanted by a new form 
— the so-called typho-malarial fever, in which the tj^hoid disease is 
complicated with a malarial element ; and, finally, typhoid fever, 
pure and unmixed, occupies the whole ground. Such a transfor- 
mation has occurred in our large armies serving in malarious dis- 
tricts — typho-malarial fever prevailing, rather than periodical 
fever. This substitution, it must be remarked, is not altogether 
dependent upon change in the hygienic conditions incident to large 
collections of people, but much is due to antagonism of poisons, 
to the dilution of the malaria, to a wider surface to be acted on ; 
and hence in individual cases it is less potent. 

The manifestations of the poison when introduced into the or- 
ganism would therefore seem to be due, not to a process of zymo-

SIS or power of self-multiplication, but rather to the continual 
additions to the blood from the great storehouse of the malarious 
■fetmosphere. 

^V Susceptibility to malarious poisoning varies greatly, of which our 
j ^lu*my is a striking example. All are not attacked with variations 
periodical fever when the cause is in full operation. This ceptibiiity to 
difference in susceptibility is due most probably to consti- poisoning. 
tutional peculiarities. Some men, although saturated, as the post- 
mortem appearances sufficiently indicate, experience none of the 
febrile phenomena characteristic of periodical fever. This insus- 
ceptibiHty is again most instructively shown in those who have 
experienced these febrile phenomena for the first time since their 
discharge after four years' service, of which a number of examples 
have come under my observation recently. But these cases of 
insusceptibility to the poison are not cases of immunity, for all the 
facts go to show that there is a gradual accumulation of the mor- 
bific matter, and slow but serious alterations in the constitution of 
organs. 

The third condition, however, is most powerful in favoring the 
slow absorption of the poison : malaria abundant, but its Hygienic 
development into more active morbid effects hindered by stances un- 
improved hygiene. The hygienic improvements consist ttie speedy 
in the careful selection and drainage of camp sites, the of malaria. 
use of prophylactics, as quinine, coffee, etc., suitable regulation of 
the hours of labor and drill, and sufficiency in quantity, variety, 
and excellence of the food. Vigorous health and attention to 
these hygienic rules are opposed to the reception of malaria, and, 
especially, are opposed to that molecular change in the solids and 
fluids which is necessary to the development of the periodic febrile 
state ; but they are not effective in preventing the slow absorption 
of the poison, nor in preventing the secondary changes induced 
thereby.

and the interlobular substance is increased in thickness and develop- 
ment. This increase of the interlobular substance is either bv 
development of its own substance, or, as is more probable, by the 
addition of new material, albuminous in character. This en- 
croaches upon the vessels, or deposits take place in the walls of 
the vessels, lessening their calibre and diminishing the supply of 
blood to the lobules ; hence the hepatic cells become pale and 
shrink, and fatty transformation finally occurs. This fatty me- 
tamorphosis I observed but in a single instance ; the liver was 
small and very flaccid. Tlie secretion of bile does not cease ; the 
gall-bladder is well distended, but the character of the bile is 
changed ; it is usually dark brown and tarry in consistence. 

Corresponding changes occur in the kidneys. They are enlarged, 
their relative and absolute gravity being increased. They Appearance 
divide firmly. The cortical substance is whitish or fawn, neys. 
and the cones of Malpighi are congested, purplish, and the papil- 
las red. The tubules are seen to be crowded with epithelial cells, 
and their walls are thickened. From the papillse may be expressed 
a milky urine, which is loaded with the dShris of cells. The 
change appears to consist primarily in the interstitial deposit of 
molecular albumen (albuminoid degeneration). Changes, not very 
definite nor uniform, occur in the supra-renal capsules ; the most 
constant alteration seemed to consist in the relative increase of the 
cortical substance ; but frequently they were not at all changed. 

The spleen is also somewhat enlarged ; its trabeculae more dis- 
tinct and tougher ; the splenic pulp brick-red, firm and Appearances

with a granular matter, albuminous and fatty; the follicles of 
Lieberkiihn come into view by reason of a deposit of pigment in 
their epithelium, and are thickly strewn at the sites of the oval 
patches of Peyer ; the villi are pale, their cells shrunken, and the 
basement membrane transparent (waxy). In the large intestines, 
a pigment deposit, greenish in color, takes place about the orifices 
of the tubular glands ; the flask-shaped solitary glands enlarge, and 
their contents accumulate. Pari passu with these changes, the 
veins of the sub-mucous coat become more prominent.

126 EFFECTS OF MALARIAL POISONING. 

The modifications impressed upon typhoid fever by malaria, are 
Modiflca- SO Well recognized that a name has been invented to ex- 
phoid fever, press the relation — typho-malarial fever. This term is 
malaria. faulty, in that it makes the malarial element the chief; 
the true relation might be better expressed by malarial typhoid. I 
have already adverted to the fact that as populations increase in 
malarious districts, typhoid supplants the intermittent and remit- 
tent fevers. During the transition period a mixed fever prevails ; 
it is a typhoid fever with a malarial complication. To the signs, 
symptoms, and morbid anatomy of typhoid, are added the periodic- 
ity, the exacerbations, and the glandular implications of malarious 
disease. This is a common form of disease, often difficult to man- 
age, lengthy in duration, and frequently fatal. 

Malarial typhoid differs from unmixed typhoid in the character 
of the delirium which is more frequently wild than low-muttering, 
in having remissions and periodical exacerbations, in the bronzing 
or jaundiced hue of the integument, and in the frequency of a 
dysenteric and pneumonic complication. Many of the cases of 
so-called typhoid pneumonia, are nothing more than the mala- 
rial pneumonia of t}q)hoid fever. 

The great danger of an intercurrent pneumonia in the progress 
Peculiarities of the degenerations caused by malaria, has already been 
nia, caused alludcd to. It is a common and fatal disease. Large 
poisoning, portious of ouc or both lungs are usually involved. In 
autopsy No. 31, the pulmonary and costal pleura were adherent 
by recent lymph throughout their whole extent, the whole right 
lung was involved, passing to gray hepatization at the apex, and 
the left was deeply congested though still crepitant. The diagnosis 
in this case was entered by the ward surgeon, typhoid pneumonia ; 
but the organs instead of being in the typhoid state were in the 
condition I have described as due to the long-continued action of 
malaria. In autopsies 9, 11, 12, 16, 20, 21, 26, 32, — deaths froraj 
pneumonia, — similar appearances were observed ; the malarial ele- 
ment was strongly marked ; the pneumonia being an accident merely 
in the onward progress of the malarial poisoning. In autopsy 35, 
the intercurrent disease was pleuritis ; the right lung was collapsed, 
and the cavity occupied by 88 ounces of serum, and soft, yellowish 
exudation. 

Phthisis, as I have already remarked, is one of the natural modes

a considerable percentage had tlieir origin in chronic malarial poi- 
soning. The state of impaired nutrition which follows upon the 
albuminoid degeneration of organs, is particularly favorable to the 
deposition of ordinary tubercle ; but the more usual relation of 
tuberculosis to the malarial state is the deposition of molecular 
albumen in the lung tissue — a lesion correspondent to that which 
hqs already taken place in other organs ; but never, so far as my 
[^■observation extends, anterior to the change in other organs. And 
■^*^this deposition is wholly independent of hereditary tendency. The 
subsequent changes which the deposit undergoes belong to the his- 
tory of tubercle. It is probable that, whilst in many cases the 
albuminoid deposit takes on the characters of ordinary tubercle, or 
becomes the seat of calcareous degeneration, in other cases the 
albumen softens, and is metamorphosed and reabsorbed. Every 
hospital surgeon has observed in malarious subjects, presenting 
the rational signs of phthisis and the physical signs of deposit and 
consolidation, the rapid clearing up of the pulmonary tissue and 
the restoration to health, under favorable hygienic conditions. 

The relation of malarial poisoning to the diarrhoeal maladies of 
the camp is capable of exact demonstration. The changes Relation of 
in the intestinal tract which I have described are easily dianh^af 
excited into the morbid processes characteristic of camp "^^i***^^^- 
diarrhoea. Chronic dysentery is a disease of tropical and malarious 
regions, and it is questionable, indeed, whether it ever exists in the 
same form as found in our army under any other climatic or etio- 
logical conditions. The initial change consists in the impression 
made by the malarial blood on the glandular apparatus of the 
intestinal tract. 

The first point of departure from the healthy state is thickening, 
elevation, and prominence of the solitary glands, due to MorWdap- 
deposit or accumulation of secretion within their interior, the Intes- '° 
The small intestine, which, in the early stages, is very *"^^^* 
transparent when held up between the eye and the light, will be 
seen studded with these glands from one to three lines in diameter. 
In the large intestine the same glands are enlarged, but are not so 
readily seen. Throughout the whole tract, but particularly in the 
ileum and ccecum the tubular glands are visible by reason of a pig- 
ment deposit in their epithelium. The villi are pale and their cells 
shrunken before the stage of hypersemia comes on. The stage of 
congestion or h3^er9emia succeeds this transparency of intestinal 
wall, and before it is frilly developed the vessels are plainly visible 
through the mucous coat, arranged in a regular arborescent manner 



128 NERVOUS AFFECTIONS. 

throughout the submucous coat. In some cases the hypersemia 
is considerable, the vessels are very fiill, and the mucous mem- 
brane becomes a deep port-wine color. This congestion corre- 
sponds to the stage of commencing ulceration. The ulcers in their 
incipient stage are established by the softening of the epithelium 
about the orifices of the tubular glands. 

The progression in the morbid processes is well shown in 
autopsies 7, 9, 11, 12, 31, and 32, all of them deaths from inter- 
current pneumonia. Beside the firmness of texture, the fawn 
color, and the increase of the interlobular substance of the liver, 
the brick-red color and fleshy consistence of the spleen, the pale, 
whitish, light yellowish, or fawn color of the cortical substance, and 
the congestion of the cones of the kidneys, there were " promi- 
nence of the sohtary glands," " exceeding transparency " of the 
upper part of the small intestines, and " port-wine injection " of the 
lower part of the ileum, and'" tubular glands visible " by their dark 
orifices in small and in large intestines. 

The next step consists in slight thickening of the oval patches 
of Peyer; softening of the epithelial layer, the villi becoming 
cloudy, granular, and matting together ; and the follicles of Lieber- 
kiilm appear as black points thickly strewn amongst the thickened 
glands. These patches l^ecome so soft that they may be detached 
by a stream of water directed against them, leaving the submucous 
layer exposed. The solitary glands ulcerate, their contents are 
discharged, and the excavations remain the centres of gradually 
widening spheres of ulceration. Similar changes occur in the large 
intestines. Ulcerations commence around the orifices of the tubu- 
lar glands ; the solitary glands become filled with a white granular 
matter (albuminous ?) and burst, leaving an excavation or ulcer. 
Coincident with these changes, the submucous coat, largely sup- 
plied, as we have seen, with vessels, undergoes an extraordinary 
development, particularly in the large intestine, and for a time 
opposes the progress of the ulceration through the intestinal coats. 
The so-called exudation on the surface of the mucous membrane 
appears to me to be nothing more than a multiplication or prolif- 
eration of the epithelial layer. 

The subsequent progress of the ulcerations belongs to the his- 
tory of chronic dysentery. 

A class of cases yet remain to be discussed, whose connection 
Nervous af- with malarial poisoning is not so clear and definite as the 
pendent on preceding — certain affections of the nervous system, 
poisoning. Pain, paralysis, hyperaesthesia, and anaesthesia, may all

accompany, and be dependent upon, chronic malarial poisoning. 
Hemicrania, tic-douloureux, pleui'odynia, sciatica, irritable bladder, 
more or less definitely periodical, are often of malarial origin. 
Paralysis of the fore-arm, resembling lead-palsy, and loss of power 
in the inferior extremities, with abnormal sensations, have, in some 
instances, seemed to be also attendants upon malarial poisoning. 



THE INFLUENCE OF MALARIA UPON THE RESULTS OF SURGERY IN 
THE WAR. 



I 

I^B This part of the inquiry is involved in the same difficulty as the 
preceding, in that it is not always possible to separate the scorbutus 
actions of various other morbific agents from the action poi^oS^' 
of malaria. Scorbutus and crowd-poisoning have also ^Ith'ma-^ 
been active, as well as malaria, in effecting changes in ^^"*- 
the organism, and hence the surgery of the war has been influ- 
enced by a morbid state compounded of these three conditions. 

Whilst improper alimentation has proved an exciting cause of 
diarrhoeal and dysenteric complications, the food of the soldier has 
rarely been so deficient in the true proportions of the proximate 
and other principles as to produce scorbutus ; nevertheless, a scor- 
butic taint, or dyscrasia, has existed in some instances, as in the 
case of the troops on the Chickahominy, on the South Carolina 
coast, and on the Lower Mississippi. 

The influence of crowd-poisoning has been exerted everywhere, 
but the effect of this, as a cause of disease, has probably been 
overestimated ; at all events, whatever influence it exerts has not 
been separated from the emanations of wounds and disease. 

The most important agency in the compound morbid state 
induced by these poisons is unquestionably malaria. Malaria the 

This opinion, however, is confined to the period ante- J^rtl™ 
rior to the reception of a wound or injury, and, of SriT" 
course, anterior to the crowding of wounded and sick in ^°"'^*^- 
hospitals. Then, new causes come into operation. It is proper, 
therefore, to study the action of malaria, in individual cases of 
wovmd or injury, in which scorbutus, crowd-poisoning, the organic 
emanations from wounded and sick, and the gaseous poisons devel- 
oped by decomposing animal substances, could not enter to vitiate 
the results. The following conclusions are based upon instances 
of this kind that have come under my observation. 

The results of surgery in the war have been influenced by 
malaria in respect to the following : — 

In repair of fractures and other injuries ; 



130 INTERFERENCE WITH REPAIR OF FRACTURES. 

In predisposing to pyaemia, hospital gangrene, and secondary 
hemorrliage ; 

In producing a morbid state confounded with pysemia (pseudo- 
pyasmia).

juries. The blood contains an excess of fibrin and white corpus- 

cles ; the connective tissue is pale and lacking in nutritive energy, 
and the nervous force is weak and irregular. Hence the tendency 
to the production of degenerate forms, to suppuration, to decompo- 
sition of exudates, rather than to the production and organization 
of plastic material. The following case illustrates in an admirable 
manner this influence of malaria. 

Captain J. B. W had served from the beginning of the 

Illustrative ^^^ J ^^^ engaged at Shiloh, in the Vicksburg campaign, 
^^- and in all the subsequent movements of the "Army 

of the Tennessee." During this period his general health was 
perfect, except a slight attack of intermittent fever, which lasted 
three days. He received, in one of the battles near Atlanta, July 
22, 1864, a gunshot fracture of right femur at the junction of the 
middle with the lower third. He was immediately transferred to 
his home on East Walnut Hills, near Cincinnati, where he arrived 
on the 1st day of August. 

The surgeon who examined the wound on the field removed a 
number of fragments, and adapted to the limb a modification of 
Hodgen's splint. After his arrival home, sand-bags and a weight 
were appHed. 

A proftise discharge of sanious pus continued for weeks. No 
attempt at union was discoverable after a period of more than six 
' weeks. His strength meanwhile declined, and some bronzing of 
the integument of the face and upper extremities was evident ; his 
appetite diminished, and there was a tendency to diarrhoea. Under 
these unfavorable circumstances, a violent chill occurred, followed 
by intense febrile excitement and proftise sweating. A chill oc- 
curred on the second day of a decided character; there were 
irregular chills during the day and night, and the fever, although it 
abated somewhat in the interim, did not intermit. The same 
phenomena continued. The discharge from the wound ceased, and 
its edges became dry and glazed. He had attacks of vomiting; 
his appetite failed, and his mind wandered. 

There seemed to be no doubt that systemic infection or pyaemia 



taa occurred ; but having observed many cases of this character 
lue to malaria, the irregularity of the paroxysms being caused by 
the local morbid process, I hoped this case would prove to be one 
)f remittent fever. Under this theory of the case, I prescribed 
j[uinia in large doses, and the result was most satisfactory. Re- 
covery from the febrile state ensued promptly, the bronzing disap- 
iared, and the fracture united. 

I give the history of this case thus minutely, because I shall 
lave occasion to refer to it further on. The important point to 
considered in this connection is the extraordinary rapidity with 
)hich union of the bone took place after the subsidence of the remit- 
mt attack. It occurred in a few days, and because the malaria 
expended in producing the febrile movement could no longer in- 
jrfere with the reparative process. Had not this fortunate crit- 
ical event occurred, the course of this case would have been the 
course of thousands of similar ones : gradual wasting and emaci- 
[ation ; profuse suppuration and abscesses dissecting up the muscles 
of the thigh ; closure of the femoral vein with a fibrinous coagu- 
[lum and its subsequent degeneration ; metastatic abscesses and 
fdeath. 

The action of malaria in predisposing to pyaemia, hospital gan- 
fgrene, and secondary hemorrhage, is evident from what j^^^^^ 

las preceded. In respect to gangrene and hemorrhage, py*™^*- 
;the agency of malaria can hardly be separated from scorbutus and 
crowd-poisoning ; but in pyaemia its agency is distinctive and 
[peculiar. To appreciate this fact it is necessary to define with 
psome precision the different morbid states comprehended under the 
^term pyasmia. This term includes an acute disease, a chronic dis- 
ease, and a metastatic disease. The successive symptoms of the 
'first succeed each other with great rapidity ; the chills are violent ; 
the temperature is high ; and the purulent depots are formed with 
extraordinary promptitude. In this acute form the blood is early 
poisoned ; it deposits a peccant matter which rapidly proceeds to 
suppuration, but time is not afforded for the production of those 
transformations in the fibrinous clots of the veins, to which Virchow 
and his followers ascribe all the secondary changes. The peccant 
matter thus deposited in the interstices of organs is probably albu- 
men in a molecular state, modified by the poison by virtue of a 
catalytic action. The tendency to this acute form of pyaemia is 
probably increased by overcrowding of wounded and by humidity ; 
but it frequently occurs wholly irrespective of these conditions. 
In the second or chronic form, the changes are very slow, and 



132 MALAKIA AN"D PYEMIA. 

may extend over several weeks or months. The veins are oc- 
chronic clucled, and are invariably fomid in the condition upon 
pyaemia. whicli SO much stress has recently been laid, namely, the 
contained clot is found broken do^vn into a puriform mass. This 
condition of the veins of the part explains the slow development 
of the pyasmic state. The poison can enter the organism only 
through the lymphatic system. 

In the third form, which is intermediate in duration between 
Metastatic ^^6 first and the second, the formation of the purulent 
pyaemia. dcpots is cliicfly, if uot wholly, mechanical ; clots are 
separated from the veins of the affected part and are deposited in 
the first set of capillaries, when the suppuration follows the ordi- 
nary laws. This is probably the only curable form of pyaemia. If 
the so-called emboli are not numerous, and if there exist no de- 
cided dyscrasia, the suppuration may be confined to a small area 
and may not prove fatal. Obviously, this form of pyaemia will 
prove more destructive if the vital powers have been lowered by 
malarial poisoning, by the scorbutic taint, or by other agencies. 

There are many striking analogies between the morbid anatomy 
and the symptoms of acute and chronic malarial poisoning, and 
acute and chronic pyaemia. The essential diiference in the two 
relates to the purulent depots of pyaemia. I have ascribed the for- 
mation of these depots in the acute form to the liquefaction of the 
albuminoid matter by a catalytic process. In the chronic pyaemia 
the deposits occur in situations different from the acute, through 
the agency of, and in connection with, the lymphatic system. The 
patient is in so much the more favorable condition for the produc- 
tion and subsequent transformation of these deposits, if his organs 
have undergone the changes of malarial poisoning. 

The following case illustrates the agency of malaria in predispos- 
ing to pyaemia : 

Col. Mihlotzi, Illinois Volunteers, was wounded in a 

Caseiuus- skimiish at Buzzard's Roost, near Chattanooga, through 
fSniroV^' the fleshy part of the arm, the ball lodging in the side. 
preSosTng ^^ ^ ^^^ hours after being wounded he was removed to 
to pyemia, ^^le officcrs' hospital at Chattanooga, and was placed as 
the only occupant in a large airy apartment containing two large 
windows, two doors, and a fireplace. He had no scorbutic s}Tnp- 
toms, was well nourished, was in excellent health, and had not 
been subjected to crowd-poisoning, nor to the organic emanations 
nor gaseous poisons arising from collections of wounded. Yet he 
died in forty-eight hours after the first chill. Malarial poisoning

was the only evident cause of the constitutional state favorable to 
the development of pyasmia — for he had suffered from time to 
time from attacks of intermittent fever. The wound was a simple 
flesh wound, and the hall was extracted fr'om the parietes of the 
abdomen, not having penetrated to the viscera. 

Hospital gangrene and secondary hemorrhage occur Hospital 
under very much the same conditions as pyaemia. fSia^^"'^ 

The hospital gangrene, so-called in our army, has ex- ^^^^o^iiage. 
isted under two conditions : 

Hospital gangrene, a contagious malady propagated as other 
contagious maladies ; at first local, but followed by constitutional 
symptoms ; 

Hospital gangrene, a sloughing condition of wounds due to con- 
stitutional causes, and wholly independent of the preceding. 

It is in the last only that the morbid state or dyscrasia, com- 
pounded of malarial poisoning, scorbutus, and crowd-poisoning, is 
the origin of the local trouble. The former may be much aggra- 
vated by these constitutional causes, but may exist under the most 
favorable hygienic conditions. The latter will be much more 
destructive if there is superadded to the local morbid process the 
specific poison of the former. 

The agency of this compound morbid state, and especially of 
malaria, in the production of gangrene and secondary hemorrhage 
was well exhibited in eleven hundred (nearly) wounded from the 
assault on Fort Wagner, received in M'Dougall General Hospital, 
Fort Schuyler, N. Y. Nearly every wound had the sloughing char- 
acter, and hospital gangrene, so-called, was developed in about 
eighty cases. These patients had served in the malarious atmos- 
phere of the coast of South Carolina ; they had suffered from pro- 
longed heat and great fatigue, and a scorbutic taint was presumed 
to exist. The malarial cachexia was the chief, for they presented 
in perfection the objective signs of that state, whilst the other 
morbific states were much less distinctly or not at all evident. 

An attack of intermittent or remittent fever in the progress of 
a gunshot wound or injury is with difficulty diagnosti- Dijerentiai 
cated from pyaemia. There can be no doubt that the £e"rZuent 
two are frequently confounded, and that patients die who feyerand'''* 
might be saved by a vigorous early use of the antidote, py^^"^'*- 

The case of Captain W proves this. The cessation of the 

discharge and the glazed appearance of the wound; the irregu- 
larity of the chills and febrile exacerbations; and the profiise 
sweats, all indicate pyaemia. If all these phenomena are associ- 



134 PROPHYLACTIC EMPLOYMENT OF QUINIA. 

ated with the pecuhar bronzmg of the integument characteristic of 
chronic malarial poisoning, the difficulty of making a correct diag- 
nosis is much increased, for such an appearance of the integument 
is also characteristic of pyaemia. It is not safe nor proper to rely 
upon the irregularity of the paroxysms as evidence that the fe- 
brile attack is one of pyaemia, for, as we have seen, this irregu- 
larity is also attendant upon a remittent fever in a case of gunshot 
wound. It is probable that the process of suppuration modifies the 
objective phenomena of the malarious fever. 

It has seemed to me that these cases of periodical fever, occur- 
Frequency ring as accidcuts in traumatic cases, have been more nu- 
feverin mcrous than is generally supposed. Several have oc- 
cases. curred under my observation in hospitals, but these are 

excluded in this inquiry for the reasons I have already indicated. 
The instances of supposed recovery from pya3mia, under the use 
of some favorite or fashionable remedy, have seemed to me to be 
cases of malarious fever, an accidental complication, and not the 
result of the local lesion. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

1. Malaria affects the physical endurance of men without induc- 
ing fever, by a gradual change in the constitution of organs — the 
albuminoid degeneration. This acts first by impairing the primary 
and secondary assimilation, and thus inducing loss of power or 
" general debility " ; and second, by predisposing to the occurrence 
of various intercurrent diseases. 

2. Upon the alterations characteristic of chronic malarial poison- 
ing are largely dependent the diarrhoeal and pulmonary maladies 
of the camp ; so much so, indeed, that these diseases may be con- 
sidered as natural modes of termination of the long-continued 
action of malaria. 

3. The degeneration of organs induced by malaria affects the 
results of surgery in the war by preventing the repair of fractures 
and other injuries, and by predisposing to pyaemia and hospital 
gangrene.

luren, in addition to liis own extensive experience, adduces testi- 
mony by physicians of this country, and the evidence afforded by 
the British Army and Naval Medical Reports, of the efficacy of 
[uinia, in small or moderate doses, in preventing fevers and other 
liseases into the causation of which malaria enters.^ It is well 

lown that, during the war, quinia was extensively employed as a 
)rophylactic. Of its inefficacy no testimony has been received by 
le Commission. Several correspondents have testified to its effi- 
[cacy, and the statements of some of these ^-re subjoined. . 

Surgeon Isaac F. Galloupe writes as follows : — 

" In my opinion almost complete immunity from malarial fever may 
be secured by the use of quinia. During my three years' ser- Surgeon Gai- 
vice, all of which were spent in malarial districts, I never had testimony. 
a symptom of periodical fever, whereas all the other officers of my reg- 
iment, and nearly all with whom I became acquainted who were simi- 
larly exposed, had the disease, and one captain died of pernicious inter- 
mittent. As long as these officers followed my example they enjoyed 
immunity as well as myself, but in a short time they became careless and 
neglected the use of quinia. My practice was to take a dose of quinia 
at night. When not overworked, well quartered, and otherwise favor- 
ably situated, a dose of three grains is sufficient ; but the dose must be 
increased according to circumstances. On a march, with no shelter at 
night, when exposed to the rays of the sun in extremely hot weather, or 
in rainy weather, ten grains may be necessary, and under unusual hard- 
ships two or three doses should be taken in the twenty-four hours." 

Surgeon S. B. Thrall communicates the following facts : — 

" During August, September, and October, in 1863, at Vicksburg and 
vicinity, a grain of the sulphate of quinia, with two grains of Smgeon 
cinchona, and an ounce of whisky, was given to every man in testimony. 
the regiment, soon after reveille, every morning. The men came up by 
companies, with an officer, and the ' bitters ' were swallowed on the spot, 
each man taking his dose and no more. It was given by the hospital 
steward under my direction. During the time stated and the entire 
autumn we had three fourths less sick than any other regiment in the 
brigade, or division, and indeed, in the army corps. The difference in 
favor of our regiment was so marked as to cause an investigation, or- 
dered from the head-quarters of the corps, and made by Lieutenant- 
Colonel Summers, medical inspector. I attributed the difference chiefly 
to the above stated prescription, and to the method of its administra- 
tion. I am not aware that so efficient a method was resorted to in 
any other regiment."

doses, repeated every four or six hours." 

The following statement is made by Surgeon C. C. Jewett : — 

" The employment of quinia as a prophylactic is of unquestionable 
statement utility. I havo givcu it, with great satisfaction, to every variety 
jlwe"tf^*^° of subject, as far as the vigor of the system is concerned, and 
in highly malarious districts. In no instance has my confidence in its 
protective efficacy been impaired by the result. My usual mode was to 
give it in solution, a drachm, containing two and a half grains of the 
salt, being a dose, which was to be taken three times daily. ' Going to 
surgeon's call, and getting the strong solution,' became so much a matter 
of routine in the 16th Massachusetts regiment as to be a stereotyped 
joke with the men. The only cases of intermittent fever occurred 
among those who neglected to avail themselves of the prescribed pro- 
phylactic. On various occasions, being on my guard as respects mala- 
rious influences by unmistakable symptoms when soldiers were at work 
at certain picket stations or camps, I believe disease has been prevented 
by a rigidly enforced administration of quinia." 

Surgeon Samuel W. Abbott says, — 

" I have used the sulphate of quinia successfully as a prophylactic 
Surgeon through the summer and fall months, giving it often with the 
testimony, powdcr of capsicum in doses of two or three grains of the 
former, with two grains of the latter, twice or thrice daily." 

Surgeon Wm. S. Willes gives the following statement : — 

" From the use of quinine, as a prophylactic, I think I have seen de- 
statement cided good results. In the early part of the autumn of 1864 we 
Willes. were in Prince George County, Va., encamped near a large 

mill pond, the dam of which had been destroyed a short time before, and 
the pond was at the time dry. Here we had a large number of cases of 
intermittent and remittent fever. A prophylactic was used consisting 
of four or five grains of quinine, with about two ounces of whisky. 
This was given daily, and the cases of fever were markedly diminished." 

Surgeon H. Z. Gill's testimony is as follows : — 

" Quinine is valuable as a prophylactic, as well as a curative, agent.

In each campaign and under each successive levy during the 
war, great numbers of volunteers hurried to the field, or were 
gatheied in crowded rendezvous or transports, without being pro- 
tected against small-pox. In none of the States had there existed,

for many years j^reviously, any adequate regulations for encourag- 
vaccination "^g o^' enforciiig vaccination, and in but few States did 
deily "d^S"^^ the local military authorities succeed in vaccinating their 
neglected yoluntecrs prcvious to departure for the field. 

Revaccination was never generally advocated, nor has its impor- 
tance been appreciated by our American physicians, though expe- 
rience in our national army in times of peace had proved its im- 
Bevaccina- portauce, and careful observations in civil life have abun- 
auy neglect- dautly Confirmed the conclusions which have been reached 
life. in England, France, and Prussia, in regard to this duty. 

The fact must also be mentioned that the good rules laid down by 
the immortal Jenner, in regard to the essential conditions to gen- 
uineness and full efficacy of vaccination, have for many years been 
grossly neglected by the medical profession. Hence it turned out 
Much of the during the late war, both in the national and the insur- 
indvu'^iifr g^nt armies, that vast numbers of men who supposed 
not effectual, themsclvcs protected fi:om small-pox, really had never 
received a genuine vaccination, while a still greater number of 
men had never been vaccinated at all. 

The Army Regulations always required that every soldier should

sion, or for delay of the duty until the volunteer recruits reached

such that, in many instances, it became the duty of the Governor

until every man should be effectually protected. It likewise be- 
came a duty of the U. S. Sanitary Commission to encourage and 
aid such efforts of the regimental surgeons. 

In the military rendezvous, in the encampments, and in the suc- 
cessive campaigns, and along all the great thoroughfares of armies, 
there were frequent outbursts of small-pox, and so anxious were 
the soldiers to procure the coveted boon of protection from the 
Seif-vaccina- contamou, that they not unfrequentlv anticipated the

sequences of work 01 theiY mcdical omcers by vaccinating themselves, 
etc. ' from arm to arm, or by means of dissolved, and, sometimes, 
decaying crusts. But the Medical Bureau made very great efforts 
to supply pure lymph and fresh crusts to the medical officers ; and

RESULT OF OFFICIAL INQUIRY. 139 

the Purveyor-General in New York kept up. as large a stock of 
good virus as the pubhc dispensaries and private practi- ^^^^^.^ ^^ 
tioners could supply. Yet, in the remote lines of the army ^n^t^g"^ 
there were occasions when an adequate supply of fresh Stioni"ki 
virus could not be obtained as soon as wanted, or there ^^^ ^^'^^• 
were some occasions when none but deteriorated crusts, or dubious 
sores which came fi'om inoculation by them, could, for weeks, be 
obtained. 

These few statements concerning the adverse conditions that 
attended the efforts to protect the armies against small-pox, prop- 
erly precede the observations now to be recorded regarding the 
normal and the morbid results of vaccination of the volunteers dur- 
ing the war. 

In the first two years of the war there were 4132 cases of vari- 
ola and varioloid officially reported to the Medical Bureau from the 
regiments in the national forces ; and, in addition to these, Amount of 
there were nearly or quite as many more cases of the dis- 5SrstyeMr 
ease that were not returned to the Bureau in the lists of °^ *^® '^^^' 
hospital admissions ; that is, the outbreaks of small-pox in hospitals 
did not, during that period, enter into the bureau records of the 
contagion, except in certain fatal cases; again, there were many 
cases of the disease, fatal and otherwise, among recruits at the 
temporary depots for the volmiteers in the several States, which at 
that period of the war never were officially returned. The total 
number of deaths from small-pox in the army in the first two years 
was 1544. Nearly a million of enlisted men were called into the 
military service during those two years. It is plain, therefore, 
from the great number of men exposed, that, considering the vast 
number of outbreaks and the widely distributed operation of the 
contagion, there was a creditable degree of vigilance and effort on 
the part of the medical officers to arrest the progress of infection 
when it confronted them in camp. 

It is important that we should notice in this place facts that will 
show what percentage of the volunteers were actually susceptible 
to small-pox and to the vaccine virus. In the absence of Results of 
a final analysis of the returns that have been made to the quiry con- 
Medical Bureau relating to this point, perhaps the most cination ia

supplies of fresh and genuine virus, and to inculcate the duty of 
vaccination immediately upon the enlistment of men. During the 
first eight months of the war he supplied, by aid of the Eastern 
Fifty thou- Dispensary of New York, upwards of fifty thousand 
of fresh virus cliargcs of frcsli aud genuine vaccine lymph. The offi- 
tuitousiy by cial rctums to the State records, concerning the vaccina- 
pensary. tiou, could uot be couiplctc, but it is presumed that upon 
so large a scale the few returns that were made would represent 
with tolerable correctness the general results. 
The total number of complete official returns made by sur- 
geons upon vaccinations performed under General Yander- 
poel's order of May 12th 1861, in the first six and a half 

months of the war, was 9248

Number out of the 9248 that were proved susceptible to the 

virus . . . ■ 2403

Thus it appears that 26 per cent. (25.9 per cent.) of the entire 
Analysis of Humbcr of rccruits vaccinated and revaccinated were 
de^poevl^^' susceptible to the virus ; while 20 per cent, of the class 
returns. q£ j^^j^ ^]^^^ presented evidences or scars of former vac- 
cination proved to be susceptible to the full operation of the 
virus. 

The same returns show, in regard to the ages of the success- 
fully revaccinated persons, that the resusceptibility seems to have 
been nearly as completely established in the period between 18 or 
25 years as in the later periods of military ages. 

In regard to the classes of the population upon whom these re- 
turns of vaccination are based, it is believed they fairly represent 
the highest average that could be found in the armies. North or 
South, as regards the proportion of the men who were fiilly pro- 
tected by early and genuine vaccination. And were we to com- 
pare these few statistics, and the conclusions above given, witli 
similar experience in vaccination and revaccination in the European 
armies, we would find that these observations of the New Y'ork 
surgeons are in harmony with observations abroad, especially as 
regards the renascent susceptibility of a certain proportion of any 
great number of adults who were vaccinated in childhood.^ In the

on the History and Practice of Vaccination, by John Simon ; the Report on Small-Pox and

Vaccination. 



IMPORTANCE OF GENUII^E VACCmATION. 

'nissian army, where every soldier is revaccinated, there were 

ip wards of a million revaccinations in a period of twenty statistics of 
years, prior to 1855, and during all that period only four ratio of pro-' 
cases of variolous disease occurred in the men who had profected!^"' 

)een successfully revaccinated or perfectly vaccinated, and only 
two cases, on an average, occurred each year in all the Prussian 
ny during the same period of twenty years. But, we are in- 
Fonned, previous to the adoption of the practice of thorough re- 

raccination in that army, and while its soldiers enjoyed all the

the past nity years, — the deaths by small-pox averaged Taccination. 
about one hundred annually. And in the armies of Bavaria and 
Wiu-temburg there has been a similar experience of the greatly 
increased protection by revaccination. Unfortunately, in the 
American armies, revaccination has not been enforced. But 
wherever, in the late war, the regiments were effectually vacci- 
nated under military orders, or by voluntary efforts of the sur- 
geons all the men submitting to the same process regardless of 
previous vaccinations, such soldiers successfully resisted the vario- 
lous contagion, however much they were exposed to it. In the 
coiu"se of such thorough vaccinations, we have known a completely 
pock-marked man exhibit a normal susceptibility to vaccinia ; 
while, on the other hand, deaths from small-pox were reported in 
soldiers who had acquired the marks of that contagion in child- 
hood. Thus has been shown the importance of offering to every 
person the prophylactic virus of vaccinia, and of repeating that offer 
to every one who is past the period of adolescence, re- importance 
gardless of the marks of previous vaccination, or even of tnT^^l^Yi- 
small-pox itself. This view of the utility of the more t^cd?^*'^* 
thorough application of the vaccine virus and of revac- *'*''^* 
cination has been very convincingly set forth by Messrs. Marson, 
Ceely, and John Simon, of England, and by numerous continental 
observers ; and, unless we wholly misinterpret the experience of 
our American armies in regard to the causes that led to the con- 
stantly repeated outbreaks of small-pox and the extensive and 
calamitous prevalence of foul ulcerations and spurious results of 
ill-timed attempts at vaccination, the vital importance of a strict 
adherence to the Jennerian principles, in all that pertains to the 
proper application of the prophylactic virus of kine-pock, has been 
abundantly illustrated in both great armies in the late war.

quantity of vaccine lymph, of genuine quality, thus supplied by the 
Amount of Sanitary Commission during the war was equal to about 
plied by the 300,000 poiiits or vacciuc charges. But one of the most 
Commission, csscutial aids rendered by the Commission in promoting 
timely and proper vaccination in the army was effected by the 
publication of a monograph on the subject, which was specially 
prepared to meet the exigencies of the occasion, by Professors 
Alfred Stills and Francis Gumey Smith of Philadelphia.^ 

SPURIOUS VACCINATION. 

In the autumn of 1863 small-pox began to be unusually prev- 
alent at many points throughout nearly the entire extent of the 
army lines. The troops in the Mississippi Valley suffered most. 
And, since the close of the war, we learn that at the same time, 
and earlier, the Confederate troops, as well as the civil population in 
the Southern States, were scourged with that contagion even more 
severely than the loyal troops of our Northern States. 

Orders for general vaccination were promulgated throughout the 
Official armies ; extra supplies of dried lymph, in one form or 

vaccination auothcr, wcrc laid in store and forwarded to the military 
fnboth'^""^^ depots and encampments ; and during the autumn of 
armies. 1863 and winter of 1864, there were more persons vac- 
cinated in the United States, than ever before in the same length 
of time. 2 

During the summer and autumn of 1863, soon after the battle 
of Gettysburg, the fact was reported that Federal prisoners in 
Libby Prison, at Richmond, had, in some instances, been inocu- 
lated by syphilis or foul matter by vaccination. And immediately

2 In the autumn of 1862, and subsequently, the Surgeon- General of the Confederate army 
ordered the general vaccination of all soldiers in the southern forces. He appointed Superin- 
tendents of Vaccination, who, interpreting the orders literally, undertook, in many instances, 
to revaccinate or apply the virus primarily to every man. The execution of those orders was 
a difficult task in the face of the blockade and the widely scattered population. Shut up to 
their necessities, the southern surgeons resorted to such virus as they could obtain from the 
vaccinated soldiers, who too often were not in a suitable hygienic condition to furnish 
vaccinia of normal prophylactic endowments.

after the war, the writer ascertained, while visiting that city, 

that as early as January and February, 1863, the Con- Eariyap-

ions of the southern troops, it would be unwarrantable for us to 
entertain any suspicion of intentional fault on the part of the 
■physicians who vaccinated the inmates of rebel prisons. During 
the subsequent year, at Camp Douglass arid Rock Island, Illinois, 
similar results followed the vaccinations of southern prisoners in 
Federal prisons. 

In the month of December, 1863, in the presence of small-pox, 
at St. Louis, Mo., and at several points where small-pox smaii-pox, 
had gained foothold in the vicinity of great bodies of sol- valence of

diers m the Mississippi Valley, vast numbers ot men vaccination 
were speedily vaccinated. Difficulty in procuring ade- andtheMis- 
quate supplies of fresh vaccine lymph from infants and vaiiey. 
healthy persons, through medical purveyors and otherwise, led to 
the general practice of vaccinating fr'om arm to arm among the 
soldiers in camps and hospitals ; and throughout the West and 
Southwest, most of the vaccine lymph and crusts were derived from 
the soldiers themselves. 

The unhygienic condition and prevailing scorbutic cachexia, 
from which the army in that region was then suffering, scorbutic 
we will have occasion to notice hereafter. Let us first heauhy" con- 
examine the history of the vaccinations and abnormal ^^*'o°^- 
results at the period here mentioned. A great number of dis- 
tinct records of the abnormal and spurious phenomena, ensuing 
upon vaccinations, could be adduced in this place, but for the sake 
of brevity and the importance of a few perfect examples, let the 
following illustrative instances suffice. 

The Experience at St. Louis, Mo. — During the autumn of 1863, 
in the encampments and barracks near St. Louis, it was An instmc-

medical purveyor. A large proportion of those soldiers thereupon 
became the victims of phagedenic ulcerations, and in the course of 
a few weeks the small-pox contagion was introduced, and spread 
among those men regardless of their sores from the vaccinator,

thereby proving that they had been vaccinated with a spurious and 
probably a dangerously deteriorated virus. About the same time 
the 9th Iowa Cavalry, a freshly recruited and very vigorous body 
of men, arrived at Benton Barracks, near St. Louis, with many of 
the command yet unvaccinated. The surgeon of the regiment had 
already procured lymph from New York, and was proceeding with 
his vaccinations, when appeared erysipelas, troublesome inflamma- 
tion in the arm, and glandular swellings. And from these sore 
arms men fi'equently vaccinated themselves. Large phagedenic 
ulcerations speedily ensued. Small-pox spread in the regiment re- 
gardless of the vaccinations, and only those who had previously 
been vaccinated, and could exhibit good vaccine scars, escaped the 
variolous contagion.^ Dr. Wasson, the regimental surgeon, has 
stated that several deaths occurred among his men, as a direct 
result of the foul inoculation thus introduced. 

In some of the colored regiments there were similar and even

produced. hundred negro soldiers vaccmated by him m a certain 
regiment, about one hundred of them resulted in phagedenic ulcers, 
and that small-pox made a fatal sweep through his regiment subse- 
quently. Such events created deep anxiety in the minds of medi- 
cal officers. Fresh virus was procured from New York and else- 
where, and a new and genuine stock of it was created by the aid 
of healthy colored children in St. Louis. 

About the middle of December, 1863, there commenced, in the 
General Hospital at Benton Barracks, such a series of events in 
vaccination, and in the morbid results from it, as seemed, at last, to 
determine the true causes of the accidents that had, for the time, 
baffled the medical officers, particularly in regard to a class of ob- 
stinate sores that was generally accredited to syphilitic inoculation 
by contaminated vaccine matter. The history of these cases is 
recited as follows by Surgeon Russell, who became chief medical 
officer at Benton Barracks, immediately after this class of sores 
began to be prevalent there. We quote Dr. Russell's words : — 

"About the middle of December, 1863, the patients in General Hos- 
pital at Benton Barracks, were vaccinated in the following

genuine vaccine vesicle. The duty was performed as ordered, and the 
vesicle was excessively drained. The next day the same man was or- 
dered into another ward for similar service, with his then irritated arm, 
and all the occupants of that ward received a charge in their arms of 
what was presumed to be vaccine lymph. The succeeding or third day, 
the same man was taken into another ward, and lent his inflamed and 
now purulent vaccine sore to the patients there. This was the tenth 
day after his own vaccination. In successive days he was still kept 
moving through the remaining wards for the same unfortunate service 
to his comrades. 

No bad results followed the vaccination in the patients who received 
the first charges of virus the first day in Ward E, and, as subsequent 
inquiries proved, there was no abnormal result produced in any arm 
except in the men who received inoculation from the purulent matter 
which the constantly teased vesicle and sore supplied, after fifty or 
more arms had been vaccinated. The greater part of all who were 
vaccinated after the first day, or the eighth of the stock vesicle, suffered 
much from local inflammation, obstinate ulcerations, and lymphatic 
inflammations and swellings. Suppuration frequently ensued in the 
axillary region, and in some instances there were severe constitutional 
symptoms resembling those of pyaemia. Ecthymatous eruptions ap- 
peared upon the vaccinated arm and elsewhere, and when that class of 
pustules degenerated into open sores, the edges were ragged, and the 
ulcerations were exceedingly obstinate. These characteristics led sev- 
eral of the surgeons, who had the care of that class of patients, to con- 
clude that the morbid phenomena were attributable to syphilitic inocula- 
tion." 

We have been informed by Dr. Russell, who observed these 
obstinate sores, and we have ascertained from other witnesses, that 
early in the winter (1863-64) immediately following the events 
just recited, small-pox spread through the wards of the barracks' 
hospital ; and that while it wholly spared all the inmates of Ward 
E, where the first day's work of vaccination was performed, the 
other patients — even those with arms worst scarred and ulcerated 
by their recent inoculation — took the variolous contagion and 
were transferred to the small-pox hospital. The following cases, 
quoted from the records of Surgeon White and Surgeon gurgeon 
Russell correctly illustrate the history of these vexatious ™^and 
results of faulty vaccination. And we must here premise •'"nciusions. 
that Surgeon White was a firm believer in the hypothesis of a 
syphilitic origin of the abnormal sores : —

Infantry, aged 18 years, native of Iowa, was vaccinated in Ward

146 SURGEON WHITE'S CASES. 

D, December, 1863. The point of vaccination on the arm was 
much inflamed, though a sore formed. But one week after vac- 
cination he sliowed symptoms of variola, and was removed to 
the small-pox hospital, where he went through the disease safely. 
Permanent marks of the disease remained. The vaccinated points 
became seriously inflamed and ulcerated soon after small-pox had 
finished its course. They healed over during the early part of the 
spring of 1864, but about the first of May they opened again, and 
did not heal for some time. The treatment, from January to the 
10th of April, 1864, was iodide of potassium, in doses of ten to 
twenty grains twice or thrice daily. Dr. Eussell reports that there 
was sub-sternal tenderness during the entire period, and that the 
ulcerations on the arm were circular, the size of a dime, edges 
raised and centre depressed. 

II. Sergeant Tiffany, company H, Ninth Minnesota regiment, 
was vaccinated December 25th, 1863, in Benton Barracks' hospital, 
from the arm of a female nurse, a very respectable lady, who had 
been vaccinated from one of the patients vaccinated by Dr. 
Kliiber after the pustule from which he took the virus had become 
irritated and inflamed. This lady had a bad pustule which healed 
with considerable difficulty. About the middle of January the 
sergeant was examined by Surgeon L. B. Smith, who reports that 
the point vaccinated was then much inflamed, and about an inch 
below this point there was an abscess ; several weeks after another 
abscess appeared, which was punctured and poultices applied ; it 
readily healed. 

The following cases are taken from notes frirnished by Dr. 
White. All these cases can be traced to the man from whom Dr. 
Kliiber and others vaccinated the patients in the several wards of 
the barracks' hospital. Many of them were vaccinated from Ser- 
geant Tiffany, whose vaccination can be traced to the same source.

[GEON WHITE'S CASES. 

Corporal of company H, Ninth Minnes.ota Infantry, aged 
54 years ; of a very robust constitution ; dark complexion ; hazel 
res; always healthy; without any scrofulous or syphilitic taint, 
'accinated at one point by drummer Stanley Reese, of same com- 
iny, from his own arm, about the 13tli day of January, 1864, at 
Jchofield Barracks. 
The vaccination became an open sore about ten days after, and 
jmained open and indolent to April 1st, 1864 ; edges circular and 
lised, centre depressed. Treatment commenced about the 25th 
>f January by Acting Assistant-Surgeon Ames, of the Seventh 
[innesota Infantry. Pills of blue mass and opium, twice daily, 
rere administered, and a solution of iodide of potassium given 
irice daily, containing about five grains to the dose, until March 
17th, 1864, when he was admitted into this hospital by order of 
Surgeon F. G. Porter, Medical Director of the district. He has 
been, from his admission to April 4th, 1864, treated as follows : 
Citrine ointment topically ; a solution of iodide of potassium, ten 
grains thrice daily, internally ; and a wash of the chlorate of po- 
tassa as a gargle for the soreness of the throat, of which he com- 
plained. Afterwards an expectorant was ordered on account of 
bronchial irritation and a troublesome cough. 

V. A private, company H, Ninth Minnesota Infantry, aged 23 
years ; complexion light ; eyes blue ; nativity, Sweden. Admitted 
March 23d, 1864. Vaccinated from Ives's arm (III.) The 
glands of the axilla were swollen, a part of the time liard and pain- 
ful ; afterwards soft, but did not suppurate. Treated topically with 
tincture of iodine to axillary glands, and citrine ointment to vac- 
cination sore. 

VI. O. Barber, private, company H, Ninth Minnesota Infantry 
Volunteers, aged 22 years ; nativity, New York ; complexion dark ; 
constitution robust ; health good ; mother died of consumption, 
father of dropsy. Admitted March 25th, 1864. Vaccinated 
January 1st, 1864, in two places ; sores round, edges raised, centres 
depressed and cup-shaped. No swelling in axilla.

rapidly improving ; circular in form, and about one inch in diameter. 

VIII. Corporal company H, Ninth Minnesota Infantiy Volun- 
teers, aged 24 years ; of a very robust constitution ; dark com- 
plexion ; hazel eyes ; always healthy, without any scrofulous or 
syphilitic taint. Vaccinated at one point by drummer Stanley 
Reese, of the same company, from his own arm, about the 15th 
day of January, 1864, at Schofield Barracks. 

The vaccination became an open sore about ten days after, and 
remained open and indolent to April 1st, 1864 ; edges circular and 
raised, centre depressed. Treatment commenced about the 25th 
day of January by Assistant-Surgeon Ames, of the Seventh IVIin- 
nesota. Pills of blue mass and opium, twice daily, were adminis- 
tered, and a solution of iodide of potassium given thrice daily, con- 
taining about five grains to the dose, until March 17th, 1864, when 
he was admitted into this hospital by order of Surgeon F. G. Por- 
ter, Medical Director of the district. He has been from his ad- 
mission to April 4th, 1864, treated as follows : Citrine ointment 
topically ; a solution of iodide of potassium, ten grains thrice daily, 
internally ; and a wash of the chlorate of potassa as a gargle for a 
soreness of the throat, of which he complained. 

Dr. Russell states that the cases here described are fair 
samples of hundreds of others that occurred under his observa- 
wide-spread ^^^^ during the last years of the war. He writes : "I 
thelnOTuia- 1^^^® ^ccn them in raw recruits, in men in new and in 
tions. q2^ regiments, in field and in quarters, in hospitals, and 

among 'contrabands ' and refugees." 

Dr. Hammer, a physician in St. Louis, and most of the mem- 
bers of the Medical Society of that city, saw the cases that oc- 
curred in Benton Barracks and in the various hospitals in the city. 
Inquiry and ^ committce of distinguished medical men was appointed 
liJectkinVby ^^ investigate the nature of the so-called syphilitic vacci- 
o/st^LouL^ nations among the soldiers there. Dr. Hammer, the 
surgeons. chairman, reports that they stripped and carefully exam- 
ined over two hundred men with the foul ulcers, and that " in all 
there existed sores spreading and indurated ; but none had any] 
symptoms of secondary syphilis. The sores existed in two forms,] 
abscesses and eczema. . . . The committee concluded, from th< 
Conclusions examination, that this condition of the patients was pre 
the*^com-^ duced principally by two causes — irregular and improper 
mittee. vacciuatiou, and exercise. Many of the soldiers vaccinated] 

themselves, employing for the purpose rusty pins, irregular incisions,] 



INFLUENCE OF SCURVY AND EEYSIPELAS. 

etc. While the vaccmation was progressmg, they went to drill, 
exercising the arms. Eighty to one hundred negro soldiers in one 
regiment, under Surgeon Ruge, were affected in this way. . . . 
The treatment in these cases was simply to cut the undershirts 
and use lead water locally." ^ 

The class of cases last referred to by Dr. Hammer consisted of 
vigorous men in barracks ; but the great majority of the -phe influ- 
patients in the General Hospital, previously described by yy'^an'd of"'" 
Surgeon Russell and Surgeon White, were .men already Sgatedby 
suffering from the dyscrasia of scurvy and malarial anse- ^o'"'"^'**®- 
mia. Again, there existed in the 1st Iowa Cavalry regiment, and 
in the men who were inoculated with virus from the bad sores in 
that command, a kind of ulcerative poison that propagated its kind 
wherever applied. Opinion was divided upon the question whether 
it was a syphilitic ulceration, or a simple ulceration induced by 
an enthetic morbid poison resulting from vaccine crusts in a state 
of decay .2 

1 Remarks on Accidents of Vaccination, by Dr. Hammer, before the St. Louis Medical 
Society, June, 1865. 

2 Surgeon Sanford B. Hunt, U. S. Vols., and late Medical Director in the Army in the 
Southwest, has contributed the following important summary of evidence bearing upon 
this subject, and illustrating the true etiology of spurious vaccination: — 

" Perhaps nowhere were the facts so closely and clearly aggregated as in the ' Northern Depart- 
ment ' (of the Ohio). In March, 1864, that Department having just been organized, and consisting of 
the states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois, the attention of the Medical Director, Surgeon 
Charles S. Triplcr, U. S. A., was called to the prevalence of small-pox. The returns of his office 
show that in the various camps and prisons for insurgents in that Department, cases of variola and 
varioloid occurred as follows : — 

March 

April 
May 

Total ... 695 ... 199 .. . 298 

" Thus one third of all cases attacked perished — a mortality unusual, and only to be referred to 
causes of an unusual nature, such as confinement to prisons and physical debility when attacked. 
Orders were at once issued to ' vaccinate and revaccinate ' until all should be protected, and to report 
results. The reports received in reply can be briefly tabulated : —

Successfully. 'Dnsuccessfully. Successfully. Unsuccessfully. Stated. Vaccination. 

1558 132 752 8025 4453 16,102 

' ' A reference to the table of variola — to its reduction from 446 cases in March to 35 cases in May — will 
show the thorough success which attended this wholesale vaccination. The epidemic was choked off, 
absolutely abolished, by this energetic use of the protecting agency, and that in the presence of very 
unusual numbers of i)ersons actually exposed. In the crowded barracks of a great prison, like the 
Rock Island Prison-barracks, containing 12,000 insurgent prisoners, the extent of the contagion must 
have been almost indefinite. But other facts, to be subsequently narrated in relation to this particu- 
lar camp, prove that vaccination played a comparatively subordinate part, and that other means, 
especially seclusion, were vastly important in checking the spread of the epidemic. Small-pox is not 
contagious in its early stages. If the patient be secluded at the earliest period when the disease can 
be recognized by the scientific eye, another and an unprotected person can sleep in the same bedding 
with very little danger. We have seen this tested on a large scale. 

" But so far our statistics show only another of the repeated conquests of vaccination. It has, how- 
ever, another value. The vaccine crusts used were those procured in the usual manner from the

150 ARMY OF THE POTOMAC EXEMPT. 

In forty-five cases whicli the writer examined in the 20th (7or^;s 
cC Armee in which recovery from the sores resulting fr^om vaccina- 
tion in the summer of 1864 had occurred with cicatrization, no 
pathognomonic sign of the syphihtic taint was present, or had at 
any time existed, so far as the records and recollections of the 
medical officers are able to show, yet most of these sores had been 
treated as being of syphihtic origin, — iodide of potassium, com- 
bined with the bitter tonics, and a generous antiscorbutic diet, 
being the agencies employed for rescuing these patients fi'om their 
cachectic condition. 

PREVALENCE OF THE MORBID EFFECTS OF VACCINATION AND OF 
SPURIOUS VACCINATION. 

No circumstance connected with the records of spurious and 
morbid results of vaccination in the armies of the late war is more 
instructive than that of the extent and the distribution of localities 
Army of the ^^ wMcli tliis class of accidcuts occurred. In the army 
S?p™rative- ^f ^^ Potomac we saw comparatively little of this evil, 
ly exempt, tliough occasionally there was a series of obstinate sores 
from deteriorated lymph and from virus taken from injured and 
puriform vaccine vesicles. But that class of the causes of spurious 
and abnormal vaccinations never seemed to perpetuate itself. The 

medical purveyors, just as good and just as bad as those which in the popular opinion were impreg- 
nated with syphilis. No information exists to prove that in the 16,102 cases in which it was employed 
any harm resulted. In the system of vaccination adopted it was used again and again on the same 
person. Thus we find it reported that 1558 primary vaccinations were successful, ' took well,' and 
run the regular course of the true pustule. 132 primary vaccinations were unsuccessful, and these 
were all revaccinated. Of successful revaccinations there were only 752, while of unsuccessful revac- 
cinations there were 8075. It was assumed, and is probably scientifically correct, that when vaccinia 
runs its regular course the system was liable to variola ; and, per contra, that when the system re- 
fuses to mature vaccinia, it will also refuse to receive variola. If this is correct theory, about 9 per 
cent, of people who have been at some time vaccinated are still exposed to the poison of variola, and 
the only safety lies in occasional revaccinations, designed to test the question whether the system is 
or is not open to variola. 

" We come now to the developments as to spurious vaccination which resulted from this investigation. 
Small-pox was alarmingly rife at Rock Island Prison-barracks. The same orders sent to other camps 
and depots were sent to Surgeon John H. Grove, U. S. Vols., in charge at Rock Island. In reply. Sur- 
geon Grove wrote that among the rebel prisoners there confined there was such a dread of spurious 
vaccinia, that to comply with the order he should be compelled to resort to force ; and further, that 
this dread was justified by the very distressing results that had already obtained among them. He 
asked to be relieved from the order ; and both he and his prisoners — although in the face of a great 
number of cases of variola daily occurring — preferred to take their chances without further protec- 
tion. He further stated his belief that, with certain new hospital accommodations just constructed, 
he should be able to accomplish the suppression of the disease by seclusion, and that it would not ex- 
tend much, if any, further — an expectation which was very speedily realized. 

" It was determined, then, to leave this matter entirely to the discretion of Surgeon Grove, and con- 
sequently the vaccination was not enforced at Rock Island. He was instructed, however, to make an 
extended report on spurious vaccination. His report showed 1580 cases of bad ulcers among the 
rebel prisoners, directly traceable to vaccination, made from crusts procured as usual from the medi- 
cal purveyors. Of these 1580 only 668 had at that time healed. Among the prisoners were al.so 846, 
not included in the above, who presented the scar peculiar to this ulcer, and who had acquired it from 
vaccination by rebel surgeons. So that in all we have 2426 cases of bad result, packed into one camp 
of prisoners, and passing under one observer." 



EXPERIENCE IN TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA. 

ledical purveyors furnished new supplies of healthy virus from the 
lorthern cities, and thereby prevented the repropagation of the 
inthetic poison of the morbid sores. In the West and Southwest, 
IS already mentioned, the morbid phenomena attending Prevalence 
'^accination were noticed early, and were perpetuated by Southwest. 
[repeated inoculation in successive series of men as they demanded 
vaccination. The foul sores resulting from such inoculation be- 
ran to require official attention in the autumn of 1862, in the 
armies west of the AUeghanies, and, during the subsequent year 
after the campaigns for the season were nearly ended, this class 
of morbid results became wide-spread, and caused a great amount 
of disability. In the army under General Rosecrans Army of the 
there was much suifering from this kind of sores. Pro- Cumberland, 
fessor F. H. Hamilton, the medical inspector of that army, states 
that he found among the troops in Tennessee sores which were 
very obstinate, and, to a great extent, coexisting with professor 
the scorbutic dyscrasia ; and that distinguished officer re- STsSJSKns 
marked that he was prepared to admit that in certain of bSe of 
the cases seen by him the results might have been due to boro^'^Ten- 
the impurity of the virus employed. nessee. 

After the battle of Cliickamauga many of the regiments were 
vaccinated, and, in most instances, with disastrous conse- Experience 
quences. For example : the 154th New York Volunteers, In^No^th-^* 
when at Bridgeport, on the Tennessee River, in October, after^he''™* 
1863, was vaccinated with virus — in crusts — obtained chicka-^ 
directly from the Medical Department at Washington, '"''"sa. 
and, as we are informed by Dr. Day, the sui'geon-in-chief of the 
brigade, the vesicles resulting from the vaccinations appeared to be 
normal, but before the crust was matured, or after it fell, they de- 
generated into foul sores, the axillary glands swelled and occasion- 
ally suppurated, and the patients became cachectic. In several 
well-attested instances this class of sores exhibited syphilitic char- 
acteristics ; possibly, in some instances, they were the results of 
contaminated virus.^ 

1 The following testimony, which we have obtained directly from surgeons in the field and 
in hospitals, bears directly upon the question of syphilitic contamination of the virus em- 
ployed in vaccination in the army. Its weight is strongly in the negative. 

Surgeon R. A. Dwyer, 175th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, says: — 

" I never saw a case of vaccination that was syphilitic. I observed a great many that were of an 
erysipelatous character. There was severe constitutional disturbance. I vaccinated over one hundred 
and fifty in the second battalion, 2d Ohio Heavy Artillery, in 1864, with vaccine matter that I ob- 
tained from the Medical Purveyor in Louisville, Ky., and it was followed by such severe effects that I 
procured fresh virus from a respectable physician in Louisville (Dr. Hewitt), and it was followed by as 
severe effects as the other. There were not a half-dozen cases that run a natural course. ... A 
good many had abscesses in the axilla, but in no case was there any syphilitic eruption on the surface. 



152 STATEMENTS OF SURGEONS. 

Dr. Kendall, surge on-in-chief of another brigade, states that 
while at Stevenson, Alabama, he saw cases of these ulcerations 
among citizens who had obtained their virus from Confederate sur- 

I obserred a great many citizens to be affected similarly. I think it was an atmospheric state that 
caused the irregularity. In the 175th 0. V. I., in 1865, 1 vaccinated one hundred, and no irregularity 
occurred." 

Surgeon G. M. Cook, 101st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, reports: — 

" To a small extent, but through the whole period of three years, spurious vaccination gave rise to 
very grave difficulties among the troops of the 1st brigade, 1st division, 4th Army Corps, while at Oolte- 
wah, Tenn., April, 1864, as well as to a number of citizens who were also vaccinated by surgeons of our 
troops. Many of these cases were unfit for duty during most of the campaign ; having deep, chancroid 
ulcers, not confined to the place where matter was introduced, but with additional sores breaking out 
months later with all the virulence of the first sore, many times attended with constitutional disturb- 
ances, though not specifically of a syphilitic character, as was often mooted." 

Surgeon B. F. Stevenson, 22d Kentucky Volunteers, says: — 

" I think I have not observed any well-defined instances of the inoculation of syphilitic disease from 
vaccination. The cases alluded to were cases where, after vaccination, the arm operated on became 
much tumefied from the hand to the shoulder, and, in a few instances, involved the axillary glands. 
The swelling of the arm seemed to be confined to the cellular tissue entirely, and occasioned but 
little pain and no ulceration, except in one instance. The integument presented a greasy appear- 
ance, and communicated to the touch a doughy feeling and pitted on pressure. I observed no perma- 
nent untoward result from these cases, and have reached the conclusion that the tumefaction was 
caused by a strumous diathesis in all the suffering cases ; aggravated, perhaps, by some impurity of the 
fluids ; or a tendency to phlegmonous inflammation, to which soldiers are at aU times very liable." 

Surgeon Batman reports several men " vaccinated from matter procured from a young 
lady from Nashville, where she had been vaccinated from a child residing there. In all, 
ulcers of a phagedenic character made their appearance, of so obstinate a form, that in 
some instances twelve months elapsed before they could be induced to heal." 

Surgeon Wm. M. Houston, 122d Ohio Volunteer Infantry, says: — 

" While confined in Libby Prison in 1863, several of our officers had very obstinate ulcers after vac- 
cination. The virus was furnished by one of our own medical officers, from his own arm. When I 
first saw the sore from which the virus was taken it had an unhealthy appearance, was large, irritable, 
and had irregular edges. In consequence of insufficient diet, and the impure air of the prison, the 
health of the prisoners was impaired, and obstinate ulcers resulted frequently from slight injuries." 

Surgeon G. F. Galloupe, 17th Massachusetts Infantry, reports having vaccinated about 
four thousand soldiers, and witnessed the operation on several thousand negroes. Nearly 
seven thousand were vaccinated in one day. No case of spurious vaccination came to his 
notice. 

Surgeon G. H. Williams, of an Ohio regiment, has seen no cases of syphilitic or other dis- 
eases caused b}' matter furnished by the purveyors, but has seen hundreds from other 
sources among the rebel prisoners who had vaccinated themselves, and among our own men 
who had been in rebel prisons. They were all syphilitic and yielded readily to syphilitic 
treatment. 

Surgeon S. B. Hunt remarks, upon this evidence, that " this pest did not prevail in the 
army of the Potomac, though vaccination from the same sources as the vaccinia used at 
the West was largely employed. Nearly all western localities suffered, an important ex- 
ception, however, existing at Keokuk, Iowa, where Surgeon S. B. Thrall, 13th Iowa In- 
fantiy, reports having vaccinated several thousand soldiers and saw no bad results in any 
instance. We have shown that in over 16,000 cases, accurately recorded in the Northern 
Department, vaccination was harmless and effective. 

'' The great sources of vaccine virus for the army medical department were as pure as 
those from whence practitioners in civil life derive their supply. The medical dispensaries 
in northern cities were the chief sources. Their stock of virus was wholly from infants. 
Another source of supply was from an intelligent physician in Massachusetts, who pro- 
duces the vaccine directly from the cow. This gentleman, Dr. Cutter, furnished perhaps 
five per cent, of all that was used by the government. His crusts had the typical form, 
with the one peculiarity of having frequently a long cow's hair transfixing them. In his

I and that the adjutant of the 33d Indiana Volunteers, who was ab-

Dr. Brock, of the 66th Ohio, states that fifty men in his regiment, 
when at Bridgeport, Tenn., were disabled for the war by such sores. 
Jle had his virus directly from the medical purveyor. At Purdy, 
Tenn., and at various places in Northern Georgia, there were in- 
stances in which the men of our army obtained virus from citizens 
or captured men, and with needles, or by other rude methods, in- 
serted the matter in their own arms, because of the ex- seif-vaccina- 
tensive prevalence of small-pox in the southern towns. SsfroS" 
The results were disastrous, as the writer can attest from ^o^i^^^^^^- 
his personal examination of the cicatrices in nearly one hundred 
of the men thus vaccinated, who recovered sufiiciently to make the 
grand march in General Sherman's army in 1864-65. 

Among the Confederate prisoners at Rock Island, on the Missis- 
sippi,— a most healthy region of Northern Illinois, — 2426 Experience 
of this class of obstinate sores ensued upon the vaccination prisoners at 
of the men. At Camp Morton, Indiana, Camp Chase, *^eNorth. 
Ohio, at Anderson ville, Ga., at Salisbury, N. C, at Libby Prison, 
in Virginia, and among our prisoners in Texas, the same kind of

diers and prisoners were exposed. 

case the crusts bore his name. In those derived from the dispensaries the name of the 
child, the dispensary, and the date when procured, were inscribed on the envelope which 
inclosed the crust. 

" But however honest these sources, the previous question — Did they produce corrupt forms 
of disease V — still remains. Surgeon Grove reports upon the unlucky vaccinations made at 
Rock Island — which finally became so evident that he could not conscientiously renew them, 
— that the bad results were confined to prisoners; that the same crusts were used for United 
States troops employed as guard, and for insurgent troops in the prison ; that with our own 
soldiers no bad effects followed, the vaccinia seeming to be genuine. But within the poison 
and on the arms of men impregnated with scurvy, suffering from miasm, or impoverished by 
chronic diarrhoea, the ulcers followed with a miserable certainty. In other words, he got 
' spurious vaccination.' And in his recommendations he insisted with a commendrible ur- 
gency, not on purer vaccinia, but on better diet and a more careful attention to the san- 
itarj' needs of the prisoners. He especially excepts one case outside, that of a feeble, chlo- 
rotic lady, the wife of an officer, who had a very troublesome ulcer from a crust that did no 
one else any harm. From Camp Morton, at Indianapolis, a similar typical case was reported. 
One crust vaccinated a surgeon, a steward, two feeble but convalescent soldiers, and we 
think one other person. The two soldiers went on to Arkansas to rejoin their regiment, had 
bad ulcers, and reports of their cases were sent back for investigation. The inquiry pro^d 
that the same crust had been pure vaccinia with two or three persons, and had produced 
chronic ulcers in two others; the latter known to be debilitated." 



154 INOCULATING PROPERTY OF PUS. 

EXPERIENCE IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY. 

In the autumn of 1862 the medical department at Richmond 
issued orders for the general vaccination of the armies under its 
care. By direction of Dr. Carrington, the Medical Director, a 
division of the Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond was designated 
for the reception and treatment of "a peculiar eruptive disease, 
supposed to be the consequence of vaccination." The medical 
officer of that division of the hospital. Dr. Habersham, reports the 
following facts : — 

" In compliance with an order issued by Surgeon- General Moore, 
Dr.Haber- in the month of November, 1862, general vaccination was 
port, Rich- practiced upon all soldiers as soon as they were admitted into 
Nov. i863.' this division ; and in order to insure the full protective influ- 
ence of vaccination (not anticipating any evil consequences therefrom), 
the order was strictly obeyed, and all the patients, even those having 
recent scars upon them, were revaccinated. A few days after the inser- 
tion of the virus, and in many cases, within twenty-four hours, the seat 
of puncture became very much inflamed with a deep inflammatory bhish 
around, which gradually implicated, in the severe cases, nearly the whole 
of the affected limbs. A pustule rapidly formed, instead of a vesicle, 
which very soon discharged an ichorous fluid. This fluid was in the 
course of forty-eight hours converted into a dark mahogany-colored 
irregularly shaped scab, prominent and firmly attached at its base. A 
The morbid ' deep-red areola of several lines in diameter, measuring from 
ass^en^rr^ the edge of the scab, was then developed, which in turn 
Eichmond. seemed to exude an ichorous serum. This was soon con- 
verted into a scabby surrounding in juxtaposition to the first, and pre- 
senting the appearance of a single scab. This process continued for 
several days, and there was often formed a scab one inch or two and a 
half in diameter. Pari passu with the increase of this scab, the erysip- 
elatous blush on the limb diminished, and when the blush had disap- 
peared, this scab ceased to enlarge. As this inflammatory process sub- 
sided, the discharge lost its serous character, and seemed to be converted 
into pus, which exuded from under the scab, loosening its firm attach- 
ment at its base, thus rendering it liable to be removed prematurely by 
the patient in his sleep, or even by the friction of his clothing. When 
this occurred, a foul, bleeding, irregularly shaped phagedenic ulcer was 
revealed, with everted edges, and presenting the appearance of a syph- 
ilitic phagedenic ulcer involving the subcutaneous areolar tissue, expos- 
ing, in many cases, the muscular tissue below. The process of destruc- 
tion of parts did not end here, for the ulcer continued to increase, and 
from the loosened edges an ichorous discharge continued to pour out 
from under the skin, which seemed to destroy the edges of the ulcer, 
thus increasing its dimensions. Wherever the ichorous pus from this 



INOCULATING PROPERTY OF PUS. 155 

icer touched the sound skin, another pustule of a similar character 
was formed, in some cases reaching the size of the primary Theinocuiat- 
sore. This, however, was seldom the case, but a smaller ulcer of the pus. 
generally resulted, which often healed and cicatrized before the first. 

" The axillary glands when the arm was affected, and the inguinal 
glands when the leg was the seat of the disease, sometimes became in- 
flamed and discharged pus, presenting the microscopic characters of 
healthy pus. This enlargement of glands, however, did not occur in a 
sufficient number of cases to make it a natural sequence of the disease. 
Attending the early stages of the formation ^f the ulcer, before pus was 
discharged, there was always more or less pyrexia, with furred tongue 
and loss of appetite. These symptoms disappeared as soon as ulcera- 
tion was established. In these highly aggravated cases successive crops 
of pustules made their appearance on the affected limb, after developing 
themselves also upon the lower limbs of the affected side, but seldom 
crossing the mesian line, and never developing themselves upon the trunk 
or head. 

" The less malignant form of the disease resembled the first in char- 
acter, but not in degree. For a few days after the insertion of the virus, 
merely a small inflamed spot was discerned, which seemed to be more 
the result of the injury done to the skin by the prick of the lancet than 
any inflammatory action resulting from a specific cause. About the fifth 
or sixth day a minute pustule was discovered upon a scarcely larger 
inflamed base. This pustule with the areola was not as great, and there 
was no deep inflammatory blush upon the arm, but merely a diffused 
redness of several inches in diameter. The same process, however, took 
place, on exudation of serum from the areola, which in turn became a 
crust, and which increased in size gradually, but never reached the di- 
ameter of the more malignant type ; and when it was detached by the 
process of ulceration, which occurred at an earlier period, the revealed 
ulcer was neither as deep nor as malignant in its appearance. The 
edges were not everted, and there was no discharge of pus from under 
the edges of the ulcer ; it only presented the appearance of an ordinary 
ulcer, showing no tendency to increase, and but little to heal. Pyrexia 
very seldom attended this form, nor was the appetite impaired. 

" The third and mildest form of the disease made its appearance as a 
small pimple in from two to ten days after the introduction of the virus, 
which gradually formed a pustule ; a dark-brown scab succeeded in from 
three to four days, which remained attached sometimes as long as two 
weeks, and when it became detached a livid or brown spot was revealed, 
the size of which was equal to the scab. This scar, however, was very 
sensitive to the touch, and liable to bleed from the least friction of cloth- 
ing ; and when this occurred it would exude serum or blood, and another 
scab would surely form. If the system became suddenly depressed 
from any cause, it would almost always assume the ulcerative process

and become a sloughing ulcer, which only healed with the general im- 
provement of the system. 

" As thus described, this disease has prevailed in the army of Vir- 
Theexten- ginia, both in field and hospital. The sursjeons of the army

ginia, and (1863). It was developed in the early part of the year in a cav- 
thrslfuth! airy regiment, in the mountains of Virginia, the colonel com- 
manding suffering severely from the disease. In every case it has been 
traced to the introduction of vaccine virus into the system. How far 
an epidemic cause may have exerted its influence in its early develop- 
ment it is impossible even to surmise ; we know, however, that it origi- 
nated in Virginia at a time when our army was upon very short rations, 
and that many of the soldiers sent from the field at that time presented 
a decidedly scorbutic appearance ; many had been reduced and were 
broken down by exposure to the inclemency of a cold winter and the 
depressing influences of low diet, want of clothing, and many other pro- 
lific causes of disease calculated to deprive the blood of its healthy 
constituents, particularly of its fatty matters. Plence this may have 
produced a predisposition. In verification of this fact I will state, that 
when it was found how frequently the disease in consideration super- 
vened upon vaccination in this hospital in broken-down and depressed 
Obscurities coustitutious, it was deemed prudent to postpone the intro- 

and proba- ■t./.i. 't ■% • 

biiities. duction of the virus until the patients were restored to a 
healthy condition by improved diet and medical treatment. At the 
first appearance of the evil consequences of vaccination, I was inclined, 
with other surgeons, to believe that the virus was impure, and because 
of this suspicion, I threw away the matter we then had, and obtained a 
vaccine scab from Dr. Knox, a practitioner on Church Hill, who assured 
me he had used it in several cases with a perfect result. 

" The introduction of this virus into the arms of some ten patients, 
resulted in the development of the disease in question in three of them, 
while in the remainder it produced apparently a true vesicle. From 
this fact, and the immunity which healthy-looking men enjoyed, I was 
led to believe that the predisposing cause existed in a vitiated and im- 
poverished condition of the blood, and so reported in my first report, 
and that the introduction of pure virus into the system was the exciting 
cause of a latent disease." 

The morbid results here described by Dr. Habersham, in the 
soldiers about Richmond, were early observed in the northern men 
confined in the Libby Prison in that city, and, under the same sus- 
picions as filled the minds of southern prisoners confined at Rock 
Island, Illinois, and Camp Douglas, the surgeons were falsely 
accused. It would appear, from evidence we have obtained in the 
Southern States since the war, that Dr. Moore, the Surgeon-Gen-

era! of the insurgent army, took prompt measures to arrest and 
control the evil and to discover its causes. To Dr. James Bolton, 
.a learned and philanthropic physician in Richmond, and to Pro- 
fessor Joseph Jones, and Professor Paul F. Eve, of Nash- gtujienta of 
ville, we are indebted for very minute and important Jn'thT^'^''*'' 
records of the history and pathology of the abnormal re- ^°^^^- 
suits of vaccination in the Southern States during the war. These 
cords, extending over a hundred pages, were kindly furnished to 
the U. S. Sanitary Commission immediately after the war closed, 
nd as they are found to be entirely in harmony with what was 
observed in the Federal armies in the West and Southwest, we 
need only to present a few points to illustrate the extent which the 
evil reached in the soldiers and the civil population of the South. 

So threatening was the small-pox contagion, on the one hand, 
and the incurable sores resulting from vaccination, on the other, 
that Dr. Moore imported fresh vaccine lymph from Europe, and at 
the same time commissioned Dr. Bolton and others to undertake 
the most careful repropagation of virus from healthy in- Means adop-

day week, returning to take the fresh and genuine lymph. Dr. Bol- 
ton obtained vii*us which, for a time, yielded results that promised 
to extirpate small-pox and the foul ulcers. He ascertained that in 
the first thirteen hundred persons, mostly adults, who were vacci- 
nated with that virus, only one failed to receive its normal operation 
and full protection. The Medical Department also gave instruc- 
tions and orders for the propagation of virus by retro vaccination. 

Dr. Ramsay, Medical Director at Knoxville, Tenn., reports that 
many cases of spurious vaccination having occurred at Experience

that post, a civil physician or high repute was employed Tennessee. 
to obtain a supply of valuable vaccine virus from healthy infants, 
in that city and its environs. Notwithstanding the greatest care 
was taken, the virus thus obtained produced no effect in some in- 
stances, and in others it was followed by erysipelas and by other 
cutaneous eruptions. Dr. Ramsay reports : — 

" Unpleasant abnormal exhibits were recently observed to succeed the 
insertion of real or presumed vaccine virus. These exhibits are not 
alone erysipelatous, but are in many instances a nondescript furfuraceous 
condition of the skin, — presenting in flakes, from the size of meal par- 
ticles to that of a fish-scale, and a much larger number of instances of 
rupia, — sores of irregular shape and size, penetrating deep in the tis- 
sues, and thickening black scabs occurring at points remote from, as

well as at, the point at which the real or presumed vaccine virus had 
been inserted. In many cases of the erysipelatous exhibits, sloughing 
of the tissues occurred to an enormous extent, even to the destruction 

of the part for use These exhibits have been observed in every 

State of the Confederacy, in every department from the Potomac to the 
Mississippi. They have been observed to follow the insertion of virus 
which, when inserted into other persons, was followed progressively by 
pimple, vesicle, cellular pustule drying, small in diameter, with dark- 
brown or deep mahogany tint, semi-opaque color, the whole completed 
in from sixteen to twenty-one days, and regarded by me as regular vac- 
cine diseases These abnormal exhibits do not depend on, or 

proceed from, any quality essentially pertaining to the virus which was 
used, but result from an epidemical cause, the impress of which is made 
efficient or active by the operation with a virus — the old doctrine of 
predisposing and exciting causes. 

" When the army of Northern Virginia lay at Fredericksburg, after 
the first battle at that place, a large number of cases of spurious vacci- 
nation occurred among the soldiers. These appeared to be abnormal 
sequelae of true vaccinations. Large numbers were sent to hospital, 
and many remained in a disabled condition for several weeks, the ulcers 
The sores showiug no disposition to heal. The army was ordered to

At Danville, in East Tennessee, at Knoxville, at Greenville, in 
Northern Alabama and Georgia, the morbid results following vac- 
cination, in the insurgent anny and among the civil population, 
exceeded any similar evils that were experienced in the Federal 
army and in the Northern States. Extended inquiry among medi- 
cal officers of both armies, warrants the writer in stating, that while 
soldiers and inhabitants of the insurgent States experienced the 
evils of spurious and impure vaccination, chiefly in those regions, 
and those persons that were suffisring from scurvy and the effects

Great effort ^vas made by Surgeon-General Moore, and the most 
intelligent of his medical directors, to procure fresh virus by retro- 
vaccination in the cow, and by the agency just mentioned by Dr. 
Bolton ; but retrovaccination proved a failure, the stock of fresh 
lymph from the children upon the plantations was insufficient to 
meet the enormous demands of the army, and even that pure 
stock quickly degenerated, and, in many instances, lost its normal

endowments, which were superseded by the poisonous enthetic 
properties of foul ulcers and decaying animal matter. There is 
undeniable evidence of the fact that under the circumstances 
^^prevailing at the South during the last two years of the war, the 
I B^^ccidental inoculation of syphilitic poison from initial sores of a 
■ syphilitic character at the point of, and in substitution for, the vac- 
r cination sore, occurred more frequently South than North. It is 
■^■Jilvewise true that privates and non-medical officers at the South 
P"^were very much given to the habit of vaccinating and being vac- 
cinated without medical supervision, and this was a most fruitfnl 
source of ill-judged, badly-performed, and spurious vaccination. 
Says Dr. S. P. Crawford, a southern surgeon who saw and studied 
spurious vaccination in the hospitals and the vicinity of Greenville, 
Tenn., wdiere small-pox became epidemic, — 

. . . . " There was great alarm both among the citizens and soldiers. 
.... Neither the citizen nor the soldier was satisfied of his Dr. Craw- 
immunity from danger, unless he could make a ' sore ' of mony. 
some sort upon his arm. Consequently vaccination was perseveringly 

sought from the ugliest and foulest looking ulcers If a ' sore ' 

was not produced by the matter from one arm, another was sought. . . . 
This spurious vaccination yielded no protection whatever from variola. 
I have seen more than a dozen cases of variola occur where there were 
large ulcers from this spurious virus, the patients thinking they were 
protected from the disease by such ' sores.' The spurious matter would 
take effect in all sorts of constitutions." 

This surgeon, whose language we have just quoted, had charge 
of a hospital containing three hundred and fifty medical Test of the 
and surgical patients at Greenville, at the time here re- power of 
ferred to, and he states that he carefully vaccinated all vaccinia, 
the men, and that " the matter took well upon all who had not 
been vaccinated, and imperfectly in some of the others." Patients 
w^ith small-pox continued to be frequently admitted to his wards. 
In no case was the contagion communicated to the men who had 
recently been successfully vaccinated, and, although every man of 
the three hundred and fifty in hospital was exposed to the con- 
tagion, only six of them were afflicted by it, and that in the form 
of varioloid. These six had not been revaccinated. 

The important fact is stated by many of the southern surgeons, 
that much of the virus used was taken from revaccinated men that 
had no genuine operation of vaccinia, but only a " sore " Delusion 
that had been produced in the manner described in the the " sores.^^ 
foregoing paragraphs. Thus it frequently occurred that virus was

employed which not only was void of any attribute of vaccinia, 
but that had the quality of a morbid poison, though the pustule 
may not have presented an unhealthy appearance. Throughout 
the Southern States, the fact seems to have been noticed that the 
most excessive and wide-spread prevalence of the spurious and 
Coexisting Hiorbid results of vaccination, coexisted with scurvy and 
with scurvy. gpiJemic crysipelas. The contemporaneous prevalence of 
small-pox, usually very malignant in character, was another fact 
worthy of special remark. Surgeon Crav/ford, of Greenville, 
Tenn., states that the small-pox epidemic which coexisted with the

cers of the Southern army were disposed to divide enthetic and 
withinfec- iufcctious causcs of the vaccine sore about equally be- 
poison. tween the specific viruses of syphilis and erysipelas. 

Among the most skillful of observers at the South, we find Pro- 
fessor Joseph Jones and Professor Eve taking a middle ground, and 
adducing very conclusive evidence to prove that while the erysipe- 
■^ith latous diathesis and specific virus, the syphilitic taint and 

syphihs. ulcer, and the morbid poison of foul ulcers, each played 
their part in distinct, and sometimes in related, series of cases of 
spurious vaccination, the leading fact in the etiological history of 
the majority of instances was this, namely, — that a scorbutic dys- 
crasia constituted the most essential part of the record of causes. 

PATHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF SPURIOUS AND IMPURE VACCINATION. 

Whoever has studied the writings of Jenner, cannot fail to 
jenner's havc bccu impressed by the evidences he adduces to the 
^^^^' fact that the propagation and successive reproduction 

of the genuine vaccine vesicle in the human family depend upon 
very strict and intelligent adherence to the principles or laws that 
govern the perfect development and effect of the virus of vaccinia 
in the persons who are successively vaccinated, and in turn trans- 
mit the lymph. The immortal discoverer of those principles seems 
to have succeeded perfectly in his attempt to enunciate the laws 
or propositions that should aid medical men in all places to apply 
the prophylactic with entire success. This was the high aim of 
Jenner's thirty years of patient research, experiment, and toil. 
And now, in a later generation, after a long forgetfulness of nearly 
all that relates to the science of vaccination, it certainly is not 
strange that there should have been such an experience of spurious 
and morbid results of vaccination as we have here described. 




I 



JENNER'S EXPERIMENTUM CRUCIS. 161 

In his evidence given before a Committee of the House of Com- 
mons, in the year 1802, Dr. Jenner stated that " In the course of 
the investigation upon this subject, which, Hke all others of a com- 
iplex and difficult nature, I found that some of those who je^n^r's 
'seemed to have undergone the cow-pox, nevertheless, on Z^^^lx^' 
inoculation with the small-pox, felt its influence just the ™*"'- 
same as if no disease had been communicated to them by the cow. 
. This for a while damped, but did not extinguish, my 

ardor I surmounted a great obstacle, and was led to 

form a distinction between the two diseases ; one of which only I 
have denominated the true and the other the spurious cow-pox ; 
the latter not possessing any specific power over the constitution." 

Thus did Jenner describe a spurious but enthetic sore that was 
sometimes transmitted directly from the common pustule of the 
cow's udder, or from person to person. It possessed no attribute 
of vaccinia; it might be simple, or it might be malignant and 
troublesome. But there was discovered another obstacle to uni- 
form success in vaccination, even when virus of an unmistakable 
quality, taken directly from the cow, was employed upon the 
infant arm when too far past the eighth day of the vesicle, or 
after many weeks' keeping. With philosophical discrimination he 
says : — 

" I discovered that the virus of cow-pox was liable to undergo 
progressive changes, and that when it was applied to the Jenner's 

1 !•• 7 ^ • TTT experimen- 

numan skm m a degenerated state, it would produce the tumcruds. 
ulcerative effects in as great a degree as when it was not decom- 
posed, and sometimes far greater ; but, having lost its specific prop- 
erties, it was incapable of producing that change upon the human 
frame which is requisite to render it unsusceptible of the variolous 
contagion ; so that it became evident that a person might milk a 
cow one day, and having caught the disease (the true vaccinia), 
be forever secure ; while another person, milking the same cow 
the next day, might feel the influence of the virus in such a way 
as to produce a sore or sores, and in consequence of this might 
experience an indisposition to a considerable extent ; yet, the spe- 
cific quality being lost, the constitution would receive no peculiar 
impression." ^ 

We have quoted these admirable items of evidence from the 
greatest medical authority on the subject, because of the light they 
throw upon the remarkable experience to which this chapter

CONFIRMATION OF JENNER'S DOCTRINES. 165 

or sores, is culpably hazardous, and that to neglect to ascertain 
the health of the child or person from whom vaccine virus is taken 
for use, is also inexcusably wrong. 

7. The evidence obtained in both armies relating to syphilitic 
inoculation, by vaccinating, strongly corroborates the con- Transmis- 
clusions by M. Viennois upon this subject ; and, so far as ms. 
we have ascertained, there was no exception to the law of such 
transmission from the constitutionally infected, as announced by M. 
RoUet, namely, that " s;yphilis always commences with a chancre." 

8. The greater proportion of the ulcers following vaccination, 
and popularly attributed to syphilis, were simply scor- scorbutic ui- 
butic ulcerations, or were sores resulting from inocula- gypMutk''''^ 
tion by a non-syphilitic morbid poison. The truly syph- ^'^^^^' 
ilitic sores were chancres, and were rarely seen; but wherever 
they were inflicted upon the soldiers or the civil population, they 
occurred in distinct groups of cases, and were traceable to an ade- 
quate source or first case of syphilitic inoculation, from which a 
stock of the polluted virus was thereafter derived. 

9. Vaccination and revaccination should be performed, in every 
person, when free from eruptive or inflammatory diseases, and 
when suffering from no dyscrasia, nor from the operation of any 
specific zjnnosis or constitutional taint, and if, to obtain vaccination 
immediate protection against small-pox, it even becomes formed when

soldiers in the war of the rebellion has reaffirmed the The great

prophylactic power. Genuine vaccination was an absolute safe- 
guard against small-pox. In ftilfillment of Jenner's immortal 
prophecy, one million of soldiers, exposed to the variolous conta- 
gion wherever they marched to defeat or to triumphs, proved that 
" the best and truest of all arguments for vaccination, will be those 
which are engraven with the point of the lancet." 



SECTION SECOND. 



CONTRIBUTIONS 

RELATING TO DISEASES. 



Section Second of this volume is devoted to Special Pathology. As an appropriate 
introduction to the contributions relating to individual diseases, the comparative mortality 
in armies from wounds and disease is considered in the first chapter. The diseases dis- 
tinguished, nosologically, as General, namely, the Camp Fevers, Periodical, Continued, 
and Eruptive, Yellow Fever, Acute Rheumatism, and Scurvy, are taken up in the next 
six chapters. The remainder of the Section is occupied with the following so-called Local 
Diseases: Camp Diarrhoea and Dysentery, Pneumonia, Diseases of the Heart, Cerebro- 
spinal Meningitis, and the Diseases of Nerves resulting from injuries. This Section em- 
braces elaborate and carefully prepared communications, furnished by distinguished mem- 
bers of the medical profession, whose names are given in the headings of the chapters, and 
who have embodied therein the fruits of extensive observation during the war. To these 
are added facts and opinions which have been contributed by numerous medical officers. 
The latter contributions, viewed in the light of testimony by intelligent and conscientious 
observers, possess not a little value, and, in conjunction with the contributions of those 
who have bestowed special study upon the diseases of which they treat, will, it is believed, 
render this Section of the volume highly useful for reference, especially as regards the prev- 
alence of certain diseases, their varied modifications and combinations, together with the 
means of prevention and the treatment, under the circumstances peculiar to military service.

The opinion has very generally obtained among almost all peo- 
ples, that the principal cause of mortality in armies is Error of 
to be found in the casualties of battle. For the origiin opinion, 
and prevalence of this opinion it is difficult to account, inasmuch as 
the concurrent testimony of all observers is to the effect that the 
great source of danger to the soldier is his liabihty to death from 
disease, consequent, in a measure, upon the exposure, fatigue, and 
privations incident to his peculiar duties, and in a still greater de- 
gree upon the violation of the well-known laws of hygiene. In 
part, perhaps, this erroneous view may be attributed to the undue 
importance which in former times was attached by governmental 



170 CASUALTIES OF THE ENGLISH IN CRIMEAN WAR. 

authorities to the casualties of battle, which too often have been 
put forward as the measure of a nation's losses in war, while the 
waste of hfe from disease in camp, barrack, and hospital, has been 
allowed to remain unnoticed, because not invested with that popu- 
lar glory which surrounds death on the battle-field, and because, it 
must be frankly admitted, governments, for state reasons, have 
seen fit to discourage the collection of information on this point, or 
to decline publishing it when known. It is only within a compar- 
atively recent period that careful and competent examinations have 
been made on this subject, or that state authorities have had the 
moral courage to make known the results of such examinations. 
But now it would seem that the inexorable figures of the army 
returns from the recent wars in Europe, as well as our own civil 
war, should forever dispel the mistaken views above referred to ; 
and that hereafter it will be impossible for this error to again make 
way in the face of the truth which is now accessible to all. 

It is our purpose, by an examination of some of these returns, 
Purpose of *^ inquire into the relative mortality in armies from 
the writer, ^ouuds and discasc, not so much with the view of learn- 
ing the aggregate losses of wars, or analyzing the causes of these 
losses, — a ground which has already been most ably occupied by 
statisticians and hygeists, — as with the hope of arriving at some 
general conclusions which may be formularized in such a shape as to 
prove rehable. Considerable latitude must, of course, be allowed 
in discussing the subject ; for many important points will arise that 
have but little direct bearing upon the simple and general question 
as above stated, and yet they are of such great interest and value 
in elucidating the natural and almost self-suggested subdivisions of 
our subject, that they come legitimately within the scope of our 
inquiry. Such, for instance, would be the relative mortality from 
the two causes mentioned, between officers and enhsted men ; 
among regular troops compared with volunteers ; the liability to 
disease and consequent mortality of the negro, compared with the 
white soldier, etc. These and such other points as may be deemed 
in any way pertinent to the object in view, will be touched upon as 
the subject matter may give occasion for their appropriate intro- 
duction.

with Russia, ninety-three thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine 
men (93,959), and three thousand nine hunch-ed and five English 
(3905) officers. These troops began to arrive at Constan- ^J^^ued 

Inople in April, 1854, and were distributed in camp in the ^""y- 
icinity of Galhpoh, on the European side of the Dardanelles, and 
cutari, on the Asiatic shore, nearly opposite Constantinople. In 
une they were concentrated at Varna, in Bulgaria, and in the 
following September were transferred to the Crimea. Siege oper- 
ations, of unparalleled hardships and difficulties, were commenced 
immediately upon disembarkation, and were continued with more 
or less activity to the close of the campaign in June, 1856. It 
appears, therefore, that the war was of little more than two years' 
duration, during twenty-one months of which time the army may 
be considered as in active service. 

The total mortality during this period was twenty thousand eight 
hundred and ninety-nine (20,899), so that one out of Mortautyin 
about every four and one half (4.6) sent out lost their *^^ ^'^^• 
lives, either from sickness, wounds by battle, or, in some few cases, 
from accident. This number, it should be borne in mind, repre- 
sents those only who died at the seat of war. Upwards of twelve 
thousand 1 (12,359) of the troops were invalided and sent home, 
and nearly six thousand (5705)^ were discharged for disability, 
a considerable proportion of whom no doubt died of diseases or 
wounds contracted while in service. It is also worthy of note that 
sixty-five per cent.^ of this mortality occurred in seven months 
time, from September, 1854, to March, 1855, while, during the 
period of encampment previous to the transfer to the Crimea, the 
army was almost entirely exempt from disease. The highest mor- 
tahty was in January, 1855, during which month the death-rate 
reached the almost incredible proportion of 1174 per 1000 per an- 
num, of which 1138 was from disease.^ The continuance of this 
rate imphes the annihilation of the entii-e army in less than a year. 
The other forces engaged in this campaign suffered at about the 
same rate. It is probable, judging from such records as have 
been made public, that no army in recent times ever presented so 
high a death-rate as that experienced here in the winter of 1854- 
55 ; and naturally enough the anxiety and alarm of the people and 
government at home were very decided. Sir Alexander Tulloch, 
who was one of the Commissioners sent out by the home govern- 
ment to inquire into the causes of this mortality, and to apply the

EFFECT OF SANITARY MEASURES. 



suitable remedies, in commenting upon this point, uses the follow- 
ing forcible language : ^ " Out of about 10,000 men who died 
during these seven months (winter of 1854-55), belonging to 
the Crimean army, only 1200 were cut off by the epidemic of 
cholera ; the remainder perished by no foeman's hand, no blast of 
pestilence, but from the slow though sure operation of disease 
produced by causes, most of which, at least, appeared capable of 
mitigation. 

" Compared with this, the mortality in our army on all previous 
occasions sinks into insignificance ; even that of Walcheren, which 
threw the nation into mourning, and for years convulsed our Sen- 
ate, did not exceed a fourth part of the average here recorded. 
Armies have perished by the sword, they have been overwhelmed 
by the elements, but never, perhaps, since the hand of the Lord 
smote the host of the Assyrians and they perished in a night, has 
such a loss from disease been recorded as on this occasion." 

Relief, however, soon came ; for the sanitary measures instituted 
by the government wrought a marvelous change, and 
relieved the army of its dangers, and the nation of its dis- 
grace. Nowhere, perhaps, do we find a more pointed example of 
the positive and beneficial results that follow the strict enforcement 
of sanitary laws than was seen in the experiences of this army for 
a twelvemonth subsequent to the time above specified. But we 
must turn from this interesting subject to inquire into what more 
especially concerns us, — the proportion existing between the two 
prominent causes of mortality, wounds and disease. The foUoAV- 
ing tables ftimish the desired information in detail.

There were also 86 deaths from accident, suicide, etc., among the enlisted men. The 
number of officers who died of disease is not stated, but the ratio per cent, to the mean

It wiU be observed, first, that of the total mortaHty during the 
war, four thousand six hundred and two (4602) deaths were from 
wounds, and sixteen thousand two hundred and eleven (16,211) 
were from disease ; the balance of eighty-six being due comparative 
to accident, suicide, and execution; thus we have, for from wounds 
the entire force, about three and one half (3.52) times ^''^^^^''^ 
as many deaths from disease as from wounds. Among the enlisted 
men the deaths from disease were sixteen thousand two comparative 
hundred and eleven (16,211), and from the casualties of among en- 
battle, four thousand three hundred and fifty-nine (4359). and officers. 
The ratio therefore between these two causes of death in this por- 
tion of the army is but a trifle higher than that given for the entire 
force (3.71 to 1). Among the officers the proportion existing be- 
tween these two causes of mortality cannot be ascertained, as the 
number of deaths from disease is nowhere specifically stated, but 
the ratio per cent, to the mean monthly strength is given at 8.4. 
From this it is evident that their losses by disease were very much 
less than those of the enlisted men, for one out of every six (5.79) 
of the enlisted men, or over sixteen per cent, of the total sent out, 
died of disease, and of course the ratio per cent, to the mean monthly 
strength is still higher. 

Turning now to the casualties of battle as a cause of mortality, 
it appears that, of the enlisted men, one out of every comparison 
twenty-two (21.55) lost his life from this cause, while SmTn 
the officers suffered in the proportion of one out of every a^re^^rdf 
sixteen (16.07) ; thus confirming the general conclusion <«^«"^i««^- 
arrived at in these studies, that the proportionate loss of officers in 
battle and fi-om wounds, is greater than that of the subordinates ; 
while, on the other hand, among the enlisted men, the mortahty 
from disease is greater than that sustained by the officers. 

If now we look at the different arms of the service, it will be 
seen, without entering into any close calculations of the Mortality 

from dis6?i8Q 

ratios, that the loss of the infantry from disease was rela- in the differ- 

,,,.,, "^ ent arms of 

tively the highest, the artillery next, and cavalry the least, the service

thougli the difference between the last two is very sHght. So also 
from wounds the infantry loss was by far the heaviest, the artillery 
next, and the cavalry least, the difference as before between these 
two being very inconsiderable. The infantry therefore (in this 
army at least) is the most dangerous arm of the service, in re- 
spect to its losses both by disease and by battle. The explana- 
tion of this greater mortaHty of the foot-soldier will readily suggest 
itself in the vastly more arduous nature of his duties ; his lack of 
the means of transportation for suitable shelter and extra comforts 
which the other arms of the service have always at hand, and his 
greater exposure by reason of his necessary position on the battle- 
field. 

LOSSES OF THE FRENCH ARMY IN THE CRIMEAN WAR. 

The French army in the Crimean War numbered, all told, three 
French hundred and nine thousand six hundred and twenty-eight 
auieaarmy. (309,628) mcu. They were in active service about the 
same length of time as their allies, the English ; were engaged in a 
common cause, and operating on common ground, where the lia- 
bility to endemic disease was about equal. At the same time, the 
service they performed, especially toward the close of the cam- 
paign, was immeasurably more severe than that of the English, as 
is abundantly shown in the reports of Scrive and Baudens ; and the 
exhaustion of strength and depression of vital energies resulting 
from this service produced among them severe losses from typhus, 
— "that terrible scourge of armies," — which fell upon them 
almost at the close of the campaign, and when the prize so long 
contended for was just about to be won. Their hospital facilities 
and sanitary arrangements were more ample and perfect than those 
of the English, excepting in the later periods of the war, when 
the bitter experiences of the winter of 1854-55 had compelled the 
adoption of more liberal and adequate measures for the prevention 
as well as cure of disease. 

The total mortality during the war is stated by M. Scrive^ at 
Total mor- sixty-uinc thousaud two hundred and twenty-nine 
thewar""°^ (69,229) ; the proportion of deaths from all causes, 
therefore, to the entire strength, was 1 to 4.46, which approxi- 
mates very closely the loss of the English in the same war. Scrive, 
however, states in the appendix to his volume (p. 485), that " sub- 
sequent to the departure of the troops for the Crimea, the mor- 
tahty in the Turkish hospitals (the French established some fifteen 

1 Relation Medico- Chirurgicalede la Campagne c^ Orient, par le Dr. G. Scrive, p. 350. 



MOKTALITY FROM WOUNDS AND DISEASE. 

hospitals in Turkey) reached the number of from 1200 to 1300, 
and this should be added to the mortality in the hospitals near Con- 
stantinople. It follows from this that the total number of deaths 
in all the hospitals was about sixty-three thousand." This addi- 
tion, however, would not materially change the proportionate rate 
of mortality to the entire strength, the ratio thus estimated being 
1 to 4.38. Of the entire losses Scrive states that comparative 
about sixteen thousand (16,320) were killed in battle or from^iiJ^nda 
died of wounds ; therefore, the deaths from this cause, '^'^^ disease. 
compared with those occasioned by disease, were as one to three 
and one half. It must in justice be added, that these figures are 
largely at variance with those given by M. Chenu,^ who states the 
number of deaths from all causes at ninety-five thousand six hun- 
dred and fifteen (95,615). From this total, however, we can elim- 
inate those who " died in France after the evacuation of the East," 
and the " loss at sea and in the marine hospitals," leaving us an 
aggregate of 79,042, — which differs widely from Scrive's list, — 
and which, assuming it to be correct, would raise the proportion of 
mortality at the seat of war, to the entire strength, to one out of 
every four (1 : 3.91). The subjoined table shows the differences 
between the statements of these two authorities : —

However these discrepancies may be adjusted, it is evident, taking 
either set of figures as the basis of calculation, that there were 
about three and one half times as many deaths from disease as fi'om 
wounds,^ which is almost exactly the proportion in which the Eng- 
lish forces suffered from these two causes.

176 TOTAL MORTALITY DURING THE MEXICAN WAR. 

Among the officers there were twelve hundred and sixty-five 
(1265) deaths ; seven hundred and seventy-nine (779) of which 
were from wounds, and four hundred and eighty-six (486) from

and officers, but the proportionate loss to the entire strength is heavier 
than among the enlisted men. As a matter of interest, deserving 
record, it may be added that eighty-two of the deaths from disease 
were among the medical officers. Chenu says, " one quarter the 
effective strength of the medical staff of the ambulances and hos- 
pitals died of disease." These deaths were mainly from typhus and 
cholera, contracted from exposure in the line of duty. Surely 
there is no more brilHant record than this in the whole history of 
the war ; and it tells plainly the truth, so often overlooked that it is 
not always on the battle-field that the greatest courage is displayed. 

CASUALTIES OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY IN THE WAR WITH 

MEXICO. 

The entire strength of the United States army in the war with 
strength of Mcxico during the years 1846 to 1848 was one hundred 
states army, tliousaud four huiidrcd and fifty-four (100.454).^ This 
force was made up of three elements, the statistics of which are 
given separately. The " old establishment " was the regular army 
as it existed before the war, and was on active duty in Mexico 
twenty-six months ; the " additional force " comprised the ten new 
regiments, which by law were added to the regular army, but 
whose term of service expired with the war ; they were on duty 
fifteen months ; the " volunteers " were the state organizations 
mustered into the United States service only for specific terms of 
enlistment, and were on duty for ten months only. 

The total mortality during the war was twelve thousand five 
Total mor- hundred and five (12,505). This number represents 
the war. only tliosc wlio died while in service, and does not com- 

the losses of the French in this war from disease were seven times as great as those from 
wounds. This is not only a manifest error, but also conveys a very erroneous impression 
both of the mornle of the French army, which, as M. Baudens remarks, was unsurpassed in 
its " stoicism, courage, and contempt of death," and of the medical and sanitary provision 
made for that army. The error arises out of the fact that only those killed on the field of 
battle are included in the number of " deaths from wounds." This error is copied in the 
last volume (xvii.) of the Transactions of the American Medical Association (p. 496), and 
conclusions are drawn therefrom very flattering to the excellence of the medical and sanitary 
sei-vice of our army in the recent rebellion, — but which, therefore, unfortunately, are very 
unjust and inaccurate.

prise the very large number who died subsequently to their dis- 
charge, from disease or wounds contracted during the war. There 
were discharged for disability alone, before the expiration of their 
terms of enHstment, 12,252, or about one eighth of the entire 
force. The proportion of deaths therefore to the entire strength 
w^as one in eight (8.03). Compared with the mortality of the 
English and French armies in the Crimean War, this result is very 
gratifying ; yet, in view of the comparatively short duration of the 
war, and the very brief term of service of the larger proportion 
of the troops (the average for the entire force being thirteen 
months and one day), as well as the nature of the service, and the 
character of the country where the operations were carried on, 
this proportion seems unnecessarily large. The following table 
shows the details of this loss for the three component parts of the 
army : —

* In the report of volunteers " died of disease," men and officers are included in the ag- 
gregate. 

It appears from an examination of this table that the aggregate 
losses in battle and from wounds were fifteen hundred comparative 
and forty-nine (1549), while at the same time the mor- fromSase 
tality from disease was ten thousand nine hundred and ^""^ ''°"''*^^ 
fifty six (10,956). The proportionate loss,, therefore, of the en- 
tire force from disease was seven times as great as from wounds, 
just double the rate that has above been shown to have existed 
in the English and French armies in the Crimea, and suggestive 
at once of a double explanation — less fighting on the one hand, 
and a worse sanitary condition of the other.

COMPARATIVE MORTALITY AMONG ENLISTED MEN AND OFFICERS. 

Among the enlisted men the deaths from disease compared with 
wounds were, — 

as three and one half (3.53) to one. 
" fifteen (15.45) « " 

" ten (10.20) « « 

Among the officers the proportion stands, — 

For the " old establishment" as three fourths of one (.77) to one. 
" « " additional force " " three and one half (3.6) « " 

For the volunteers the ratio cannot be ascertained with any degree 
of accuracy, as the deaths of the officers are included in the table 
■with those of the enlisted men. From these ratios it appears that 
the mortality from disease among the enlisted men is very largely 
in excess of that of the officers ; and reversing the ratios, or compar- 
ing the mortality from wounds with that from disease, it appears 
that the officers lost more relatively from wounds than the men. 
As the number of men and officers are included in one aggregate, 
it would be impossible to ascertain the correct proportion of these 
losses — officers compared with men — except upon an arbitrary di- 
vision of the " whole number sent out," i. e., assuming that such a 
proportion were officers, and the remainder enlisted. But enough 
has been shown to answer our purposes. 

The following table ^ shows at a glance the comparative losses 
per 1000 per annum among the three subdivisions of the army : —

:n^umber of troops in service. 179 

On the other hand, the " old estabhshment " shows a very much 
smaller death-rate from disease than its associates in the war. The 
sickness in any given regiment has been said to bear an inverse 
ratio to the efficiency of its discipline. Baudens conveys the same 
idea when he says, as the result of his large experience : "I 
could show that the mortahty and sickness in the several regi- 
ments always bore an exact relation to the degree of solicitude 
which the officers bestowed upon the soldier." In this we can 
probably find an explanation of this small mortality of the " old 
establishment " ; for the strict discipline of the regular army, and the 
provident care of the officers for their subordinates were in strik- 
ing contrast with the condition of things that obtained among the 
new troops. Then, too, the physical stamina of the old troops was 
better than that of the new, for the recruits were selected with much 
greater care. 

MORTALITY IN THE RECENT REBELLION IN THE UNITED STATES.i 

The whole number of troops mustered into the service of the 
United States in the recent rebellion was two millions The number 
seven hundred and eighty-nine thousand eight hundred the service 
and ninety-three (2,789,893). This number was made states. 
up from the regular army and the volunteers, white and colored. 
The war lasted for little upwards of four years, and as regards its 
severity, pertinacity, and magnificent proportions, has never been 
equaled in modern times. 

1 The materials for this section are taken entirely from the " Report of Provost Marshal 
General Fry to the Secretary of War," Message and Documents^ War Departnxent, 1855-56. 
Part 3, pp. 72 to 83. As this is at present the only source from which this information could 
be obtained, the utmost freedom has been taken with it, and in some instances the exact 
language is quoted, for which, without specifying m every instance, due acknowledgment 
is here made. This Report is made up from the monthly returns to the Adjutant-General, 
and the muster and pay-rolls of the army; and while it is not claimed that the figures and 
calculations there given are absolutely correct, they furnish the most accurate information 
to be obtained at piesent, and for the purposes in view in this paper they may be considered 
essentially trustworthy. It may be added in confirmation of their general reliability, that 
these returns are the official source of all information relative to the military history of the 
soldier, and, as such, are relied upon by the War Department to determine the final settle- 
ment of accounts and the disposition of the men. The percentage of error is therefore verv' 
small, and in all probability will not materially alter the ratios obtained in the study of 
these figures should a record absolutely without error be obtained at any subsequent time. 
It is to be hoped the official medical and surgical history of the war,, as well as the forth- 
coming final report of the Medical Bureau of the Provost Marshal General's Department, 
will furnish such a record, and in a shape more available for statistical purposes than the 
figures now ai hand.

The whole number of men enHsted during the war among whom 
these casuakies occurred is given at 2,789,893, of which one hun- 
dred and eighty thousand and seventeen (180,017) were colored 
troops, and sixty-seven thousand (67,000) by estimate were regu- 
lars. The terais of service varied from three months to three 
years. Reduced to a three years' standard, the equivalent is 
given as 2,154,311. 

From this table it appears that during the rebellion two hundred 
and seventy-nine thousand three hundred and seventy-six Mortality

muster-out of service, from disease or wounds contracted while in 
the service. There was also an inconsiderable number of deaths 
from accidental causes, etc. None of these are included in this

estimate. The general proportion of mortality, therefore, to the 
whole number in service, is about as one out of every ten (9.98). 

Of the entire mortality ninety-six thousand and eighty-nine 
Comparative (96,089) deaths Were caused by wounds, and one hun- 
SonldiSase ^^^^ ^^^ eighty-tlirce thousand two hundred and eighty- 
and wounds. ^^^^^^ (183,287) wcre from disease. The proportion of 
deaths from these two causes, therefore, was about one in two 
(1.90). In other words the deaths from disease were twice as 
numerous as those from wounds. It will be remembered, as we 
have above seen, that in the Mexican War our losses from disease 
were seven times as great as from wounds. In the Crimean War 
the losses of the English and French were each four times as 
numerous from disease as fi'om wounds. The ratio, then, observ- 
able in our own recent war, is not only a cause of congratula- 
tion to ourselves, for the liability to disease and death, from the 
sudden changes from the habits and occupations of civil life, from 
exposure, fatigue, and privation, and from the local noxious in- 
fluences to which our troops were exposed, to say nothing of the 
dangers of the battle-field, Avas fully equal to that experienced in 
any one of the above-mentioned campaigns ; but it also shows con- 
clusively the efficiency of the sailTtary regulations enforced in our 
army ; indicates the skill and adequate numbers of the medical 
staff, and the perfection of that vast hospital system for the care of 
the sick and wounded, and attests the value of the labors of the 
Sanitary Commission in giving that supplementary aid, which was 
so bounteously lavished by them both in hospital and on the 
field. Another element, too, was at work among our soldiers 
In this war, that measurably enabled them to resist the encroach- 
ments of disease, — ^. e., the springiness and buoyancy of spirits 
resulting from the extraordinary facilities allowed for communica- 
tion and personal intercourse with fi'iends and relatives at home, 
by whose approval they were encouraged in victory and sustained 
in defeat ; and again, there w^as to be noted — in a marked degi-ee 
— the individual consciousness of the soldier, that on the result of 
their efforts depended the very existence of the great nation to 
which they belonged. The influence of such causes — psycholog- 
ical rather than physical — in producing a low rate of mortality in 
ai-mies, is perhaps too often under-estimated. 

Looking more in detail into these figures, it will be seen that out 
comparatiye of the whole uumbcr of deaths, from all causes, seven 
among en- thousaud five hundred and thirty-five (7535) were offi- 
and officers, ccrs, and two hundred and seventy-one thousand eight

hundred and forty-one (271,841) were enlisted men. The gen- 
eral proportion, therefore, of mortahty, among the officers com- 
pared -with enhsted men, is as one to thirty-six. 

Of the whole number of deaths from wounds^ five thousand two 
hundred and twenty-one (5221) were officers, and ninety thousand 
eight hundred and sixty-eight (90,868) were enlisted men. Thus 
it appears that one officer was killed or died of wounds, to about 
every eighteen men. Of the deaths from disease^ two thousand three 
hundred and fourteen (2314) were anlong the officers, and one 
hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and seventy-three 
(180,973), were among the enlisted men, thus showing only one 
death from this cause among the officers, to every ninety deaths 
among the enhsted men. Now, as the officers in complete organ- 
izations constitute about one twenty-fifth part of the whole num- 
ber, it appears that the rate of mortality from disease, among the 
enlisted men, was nearly four times as great as among the officers ; 
while on the other hand, the death-rate from wounds was one and 
one half times greater among the officers than the enlisted men. 
General Fry, in speaking of these ratios says, very forcibly : — 

" This remarkable disproportion, so greatly to the advantage of the 
commissioned officer, is owing to several causes. Officers are better 
sheltered than men, and their food is generally better in quality and 
more varied in kind, so that they suffer less from diseases of the diges- 
tive organs. They are not so much crowded together in tents and 
quarters, and are, therefore, less subject to contagious and epidemic 
maladies. They have superior advantages in regard to personal clean- 
liness. As prisoners of war, too, they were generally treated more 
leniently, and so furnished fewer names to the mortality lists of Ander- 
sonville, Salisbury, and other similar dens of death. Another favoring 
circumstance, and by no means the least potential, was the superior 
morale, the hopefulness, and elasticity of spirit which is given to a man 
by investing him with a commission, and its accompanying authority, 
responsibility, and chances of advancement." 

Of the enlisted men^ ninety thousand eight hundred and sixty- 
eight (90,868) died of wounds, and one hundred and eighty thou- 
sand nine hundred and seventy-three (180,973) died of disease. 
This gives a proportion of two deaths from disease, to one by the 
casualties of battle (1.99:1). Of the officers, five thousand two 
hundred and twenty-one (5221) were either killed in action, or 
died of wounds, while only two thousand three hundred and four- 
teen (2314) died of disease. The death-rate, therefore, among 
officers is about twice (2.25) as great from wounds as from disease. 



184 MORTALITY IN DIFFERENT ARMS OF SERVICE. 

A noteworthy feature in the above tables, Is the very large ex- 
Large excess cess of deaths from disease among the colored troops, as 

of deaths ^ 

from disease Compared with the white. While 2997 were killed in 
ored troops, action or by wounds, 26,301 died from disease, sho^ving 
that the deaths from disease were eight times as numerous as from 
wounds. We have already seen that the proportion for the army 
at large, was about two to one. The number of deaths from all 
causes, among the colored troops, proportioned to the total strength, 
is also worthy of note, for it appears that one out of about every 
seven in service lost his life ; the proportion for the white troops 
being about one in fifteen. This mortality is the highest shown in 
the records of this war. These figures appear to indicate pretty 
conclusively that the negro, as he was found in our armies, was less 
capable than the white man of enduring the fatigues and hardships, 
and of withstanding the influences of disease incident to army life. 
Assuming that where one man dies of disease, at least five others 
are seriously sick (and this proportion is not probably too large), 
it will be seen that a very large proportion of the colored troops 
must have been constantly sick. What the causes of this greater 
susceptibility of the negro to disease are, hardly come within the 
scope of this paper ; but it is suggested, to use the words of Gen- 
eral Fry, " that they were rather psychological than physical, and 
arose from lack of heart, hope, and mental activity, and that a 
higher moral and intellectual culture would diminish the defect." 

In considering the mortality in the different arms of the service, 
Mortality in ^^ cauuot arHvo at any conclusion as to the relative pro- 
araiSthe'^ portiou of deaths to the numbers engaged, for we have 
semce. ^^ statement of the number of troops assigned to these 
special corps. We can, however, obtain some interesting conclu- 
sions as to the relative frequency of death from the two causes — 
wounds and disease. Taking first the cavalry, and consolidating 
the three branches of the service, regulars, volunteers, and col- 
ored troops, it appears that there were twenty-six thousand four 
hundred and five (26,405) deaths from disease, and eleven thou- 
sand seven hundred and ninety-eight (11,798) from wounds, or a 
proportion of about two (2.23) to one. In the artillery there were 
twelve thousand eight hundred and thirty-two (12,832) deaths from 
disease, and two thousand one hundred and twenty-two (2122) 
from wounds, giving a proportion of six to one. In the infantry the 
deaths from disease were one himdred and fifty-four thousand and 
fifty (154,050), and eighty-one thousand one hundred and sixty- 
nine (81,169) fi'om wounds. So that the proportion here is a little

185 



jss than two (1.89) to one. These figures show that the compar- 
ative clanger from the casuahies of battle is decidedly less in the 
artillery than either the cavalry or infantry, and somewhat less 
in the cavalry than the infantry. A similar conclusion, it will be 
remembered, has before been arrived at in the other armies under 
consideration. It will also be noticed that among the enlisted men 
in each arm, the loss of life from disease is vastly greater than from 
wounds, while among the officers, with the single exception of the 
colored artillery, wounds and battle killed more than disease. The 
cause of this greater mortality among officers, from the casualties 
of battle, is obvious, and needs no explanation here. 

As a matter of considerable interest, though not exactly perti- 
nent to our general inquiry, we give below the proper- ^he propor- 
tion per one thousand, which each State and group of Susandof 
States furnished in the mortahty from the two causes fro^^sLse 
under consideration. The total number of casualties per ^"^^ wounds. 
one thousand of those in active service, is given in the last column, 
and is made up from the resignations, discharges, dismissals, deser- 
tions, missing in action and accidents, in addition to the causes 
specified in the first two columns. The officers are included in 
estimating all these ratios.

From these tables we see at a glance which States contributed 
Comparatire *^^^ largest sharc of mortality, and also the relative mor- 
^o*ng*^^ tality from wounds and disease. It is observable that, 
Sfferenr"^ in general, the battle mortality is highest in the northern 
states. |.-gj. q£ States, whether eastern or western. The high 

ratio of New England, 44.76, corresponds with the ratios of Iowa, 
45.44, Michigan, 44.82, and Wisconsin, 42.01. This greater rate 
of battle mortality among the northern troops might, on a hasty 
examination, be assumed to imply a greater degree of bravery 
on the battle-field ; but this interpretation is not probably the 
correct one. An explanation of it will undoubtedly be found in 
the fact, that, situated far distant from the seat of war, it was 
not necessary to keep any of their troops in garrison for the 
protection of their borders; they were, therefore,, constantly in 
active service at the front. A remarkable deviation from this 
Mortality in ^le, howcvcr, is presented in Kansas, which was a 
Kansas. frontier State during almost the whole war, and yet 
shows the highest battle mortahty on the list. ".Her popu- 
lation is a peculiarly pugnacious one, rendered such by their 
origin and history. The same singularly martial disposition which 
induced above half the able-bodied men of the State to enter 
the army without bounty may be supposed to have increased 
their exposure to the casualties of battle after they were in 
the service." Generally, also, those States which show a large

thesernce. the nature of the respective services required of the 
troops from different localities. Thus, an undue proportion of 
New-England troops served in the unhealthy departments of the 
South and the Gulf, which, in a measure, accounts for their high 
mortahty, 70.45. The regiments raised in the Western States 
served mostly in the fever-breeding districts of the Southern Miss- 
issippi and Southwest, and this, no doubt, aided in swelling their 
mortality to 71.55. The Middle States, whose troops served

mainly in the army of the Potomac, sliow a mortahty of only 
37.88, which is very largely below the general average for the 
States. Virginia was not only a healthier field of service than the 
South and Southwest, but it is very generally admitted that the 
army of the Potomac was the best provided for of all our large 
armies. 

Comparing the three services, — regulars, volunteers, and colored 
troops, — we see, as has already been shown in another comparison 
calculation, that the colored troops -suffered the highest among: regu- 
loss from disease, and the volunteers from wounds. The teer, mux 
extreme rate of the total casualties in the regular service troops. 
is explained by the enormous excess of desertions — a cavise of loss 
with which we are not now concerned.

The casualties among the medical officers during this war were 
very numerous. The proportionate mortahty can only casualties 
be ascertained when full reports shall have been made of cai officers. 
the entire strength of this corps ; but it can with safety be asserted 
that in the losses of medical officers by battle and wounds, no army 
of modern times ever approached this. The whole number of cas- 
ualties were 336, namely :^ Killed 'in battle, 29 ; died of wounds, 
10 ; killed by accident, 12 ; died of various diseases, 285. There

This table shows a larger number killed and died of wounds 
than died of disease — a conclusion that cannot for a moment be 
accepted as correct. It not only is at variance with the known 
experiences of all other armies, so far as we have any records of 
them, but it implies a degree of well-being among the Confederate 
troops that is contradictory of what is positively known of their 
condition, state of disciphne, equipment, and supplies. The truth 
will probably never be known, and perhaps it is as well for the 
credit of those most directly interested that it should not, though 
both as a matter of history and as a contribution to statistical 
science, it would be of great value, and in the highest degree 
interesting. 

It is not deemed necessary for the purposes of this paper to 
r/)sse8 in ^Pply to any other mihtary statistics the minute analysis 
bietam-*^ that has been made of the mortahty of the armies that 
paigus. have just passed under consideration. To do so would 

only weary by its detail, while, at the same time, it would add 
nothing to the general conclusions we shall submit as fairly proven 
by these statistics ; nor, in our estimation, would it invahdate any 
of them.i But we think it advisable to here present a summary 

1 It is much to be regretted that there are no official statistics of the losses during the 
Italian War, so called, of 1859. The results of this war — one of the most remarkable, in 
many respects of modern times — may possibh- atford an exception to our second conclusion, 
as given below ; for it must be remembered that the duration of the active campaign was 
less than sixty days, in which time four battles were fought. Two of these battles — 
Magenta and Solferino — were among the fiercest and bloodiest on record, and the loss of 
life was immense. It would seem that so short a period would not suffice for disease to 
make full headway, and that in all probability the losses from this cause were less than from 
the casualties of battle.

of the losses in some other notable campaigns, by way of confirming 
the general proposition, that armies invariably lose more from 
disease than from wounds, and also of affording standards of com- 
parison for our own recent losses in war. 

THE SARDINIAN ARMY IN THE CRIMEAN WAR.i 

In the Crimean War the Sardinians had an army whose effective 
strength was about twenty-one thousand men, and in the period of 
thirteen months (May, 1855, to June, 1856), the recorded mortality 
was two thousand three hundred and fifly-four (2354), of which 
twelve (12) were killed in battle. Sixteen (16) died of wounds, 
and six (6) by accident, while the comparatively enormous number 
of two thousand three hundred and twenty (2320) died of disease. 
An epidemic of cholera swept off eighteen hundred and thirty of 
this number. While this instance of mortality must be regarded 
as exceptional, if we consider the actual proportion existing between 
the number of deaths fi'om wounds and from disease, it is a striking 
illustration of our general proposition, and confirms in a very pos* 
itive manner the conclusion of M. Meyenne, that " the mortality in 
time of war is always proportioned to the degree of well-bemg of 
the soldier and the sanitary attentions bestowed upon him."

1 Elements de Statistique Medicale Militaire, par le Dr. Meyenne, p. 82. Quoted by him 
from the Report of Dr. Antonio Comisetti, Chief Medical Officer of the Sardinian Army 
during the Crimean War. M. Chenu also quotes this report, but his figures are at variance 
with those of Meyenne's. It may not be out of place to here remark, that no official statis- 
tics of the losses of the other armies engaged in this war have been published. Chenu gives 
(as an approximation) the losses of the Russians at 30,000 killed, and 600,000 died of disease 
and wounds; of the Turkish army, 10,000 killed, and 25,000 died of disease and wounds. 
Although these figures do not probably vary very largely from the truth, they are not enti- 
tled to any consideration as authority.

190 THE EXPEDITION TO WALCHEREN. 

Thus one eleventh (tt) P^^t of the effective strength was carried 
off by disease, and only one two hundred and sixty-fifth (^1^3^) by 
the casualties of battle (^par lefer et lefeu). That is to say, twenty- 
three times as many died from disease as from wounds. M. Bou- 
din, therefore, has good reason for asserting that " the hospital is 
the true field of battle for the soldier." 

THE ENGLISH ARMY IN SPAIN.i 

It appears from the official reports published by Mr. Marshall, 
Inspector of the British Army, that the losses during the last forty- 
one months of the Peninsular War (a period extending from De- 
cember 25, 1810, to May 25, 1814), were fi-om disease, 24,930, 
and ft-om the casualties of battle, 8889. The average effective 
strength during this time was 61,511. The average effective 
strength of the officers was 2716, and their losses were, " killed or 
died of wounds," 566 ; " died of disease," 374. The total losses 
of the officers compared with privates was as one to thirty-six, while 
their numerical strength was as one to twenty-two and one half. 
Dr. Edmonds remarks that " the number of deaths of officers in any 
one month is generally indicative of the fighting during that month, 
but the number of deaths of privates is of very little value in that 
respect." This is only another way of stating the conclusion which 
has already been arrived at in this paper, in relation to the propor- 
tionate losses of officers and enlisted men from wounds and disease. 

THE EXPEDITION TO WALCHEREN.2 

In July 1809, the British Government sent an army of 39,214 
men to the Netherlands, — the same country in which, some sixty- 
five years previously, the English army was engaged. The experi- 
ences of this first campaign, which are so graphically described by 
Sir John Pringle in his " Observations on the Diseases of Armies," 
were here again repeated. In about four months time the loss 
from the deadly marsh fevers was 4175, while only 216 died from 
wounds. Per one thousand of effective strength, the loss from 
wounds was 16.7, while that from disease reached the figure of 
332. The number of sick was so great that at the end of this 
period, — four months from the time of leaving England, — only 
14,000 effective men were left for duty out of the entire army. 
It was this campaign which so wrought upon the minds of the

English people, and to which Sir Alexander Tulloch so feelingly 
alludes in the paragraph already quoted. 

r^ LOSSES IN THE ENGLISH NAVY.i 

• In the English navy, during five years of war, the comparative 
losses were : —

1777 5,247 . 40 

1778 4,801 254 

1779 4,726 551 

1780 4,092 293 

Again, from 1830 to 1836 inclusive, the official reports of the 
English Government show a mortality in the navy of 2175 out of 
an effective strength of 157,770. Of these deaths only 307, or about 
one sixth, were from wounds or accident. ' 
THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN TURKEY.2 
" Out of 115,000 Russians, who invaded Turkey in Europe in 
1828 and 1829, 10,000 to 15,000 only recrossed the Pruth. The 
remainder died in the hospitals of intermittent fever, dysentery, and 
the plague. . . . From the month of May, 1828, to February, 1829, 
there were admitted into the field and general hospitals 210,108 
patients. The greatest prevalence of disease was in September and 
October. In this last month 20,000 sick entered the general hospitals 
alone. The month of February gave the greatest mortality — over 
one quarter of all sick dying. These facts are not exact enough to 
enable us to estimate the entire losses of the army during this first 
campaign, but we can without exaggeration place it at one half of 
the effective strength, that is to say, about 40,000 men, including 
the deaths on the field of battle. . . . The number of deaths in 
the general hospitals alone, from March to July (1829), was about 
28,000. There was very nearly the same number in the last five 
months of the year ; so that if we add to these figures the deaths 
in the regimental hospitals and on the field of battle, we do not 
exceed the limits of truth in placing the losses for the year 1829 at 
60,000." These statements, it is true, do not afford any accurate 
means of comparison between losses from disease and from wounds, 
but it is evident from the account as given in ftill, that the losses 
fi-om disease were enormously in excess of those from wounds.

wars ; they would all convey the same lesson. Enough 
has already been brought forward in the statements, based upon 
official statistics, to warrant the following conclusions : — 

1. That the aggregate mortality in armies in time of war is 
very variable — depends upon the nature of the service, the sus- 
ceptibility of the men to endemic influences, and above all, upon 
the degree of exactness with which sanitary and hygienic measures 
are enforced. 

2. That in armies the deaths from disease are invariably greater 
in number than those fi'om wounds, and that there is no fixed pro- 
portion between them ; the ratios ranging, as we have seen, be- 
tween two to one and twenty to one, or in other words, from sixty 
to ninety-five per cent, of the entire mortality is attributable to 
disease. 

3. That officers invariably lose, by the casualties of battle, a 
larger proportion than enlisted men. 

4. That enlisted men invariably lose from disease a very much 
larger proportion than officers. 

5. That the losses numerically among officers are greater from 
wounds than from disease, while the reverse is true of enlisted 
men. 

6. That the infantry is the most dangerous arm of the service, 
whether considered in the hability of the soldier to death from 
disease or from the casualties of battle. The difference between 
the artillery and cavalry is not very great, but the data are not 
sufficient to enable one to say which is the more dangerous. 

7. That in armies the negro — so far as the experiences of our 
recent rebellion will justify the inference — is more liable to dis- 
ease and death than the white man, and therefore not so well 
adapted for the occupation of a soldier. Further experiences may 
modify, or possibly even reverse, this conclusion.

CONDITIONS MODIFYING THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND MORBID ANAT- 
OMY OF THE FEVERS OF THE ARMY, — REMITTENT AND TYPHOID. 

Several distinct febrile diseases have been included under the 
term " Camp Fever." Dr. Woodward has attempted Dr. wood- 
to show, in Circular No. 6, that there is a disease con- ^/of typho^ 
sisting of these fevers blended, to which this term is fever" 
properly applicable. He includes under this designation typhoid 
and remittent fevers, and has proposed the name — typho-malarial 
— to express his view of the constitution of the mixed disease. 

1 Statistics showing the prevalence and fatality of typhoid fever in the Confederate army 
are combined with statistics relating to pneumonia. Vide chapter on " Pneumonia in the Con- 
federate Army," by Professor Joseph Jones. — Editor.

194 DR. WOODWARD'S THEORY. 

He makes three sub-varieties of the typho-malarial fever : mala- 
rial, scorbutic, and enteric (p. 140, 141) — distinctions as unmean- 
ing, clinically, as the terms themselves are tautological. There are 
essential differences, as we shall show farther on, between these 
groups of diseases thus violently classed together. Moreover, the 
term typho-malarial is most faulty. It assumes that the typh 
element is simply a modifying condition, and that the essence of 
the disease is malarial — an assumption not warranted by the 
facts. 

These several forms of fever preserved as distinct clinical feat- 
ures in the army as the same forms of disease in civil life. Any 
one who has observed the behavior of fevers in the interior region 
of this continent — the Valley of the Mississippi and its tribu- 
taries — will have been struck with a significant fiict : the gradual 
substitution, as populations increase and the face of nature changes, 
of continued fever for the malarial fevers. During the period of 
transition from one form of fever to the other, a mixed ty[)e may 
prevail ; or, as the idea may be morre properly expressed, a mala- 
rial element remains to obscure the distinctive characters of the 
continued fever. Notwithstanding; this occasional conversion of 
types, the cases which may not be readily assigned to their appro- 
priate classes are indeed few in number. That a more definite 
classification than the one proposed by Dr. Woodward, and adopted 
in Circular No. 6, might have been made, is evident enough on an 
examination of the statistics of fever for the first two years of the 
war. Taking as examples the two forms, typhoid and remittent, 
we have this result : whilst the cases of typhoid increased 42 per 
cent, from the first to the second year, the cases of remittent 
increased somewhat more than 100 per cent, for the same period. 
The influence of the bad hygiene of the camp is first seen, and 
afterward the agency of malaria. When Dr. Woodward's term, 
typho-malarial, came into use, we find one sixth of the whole 
number of cases of fever grouped together under this designation. 
That these cases might have been assigned to either the remittent 
or continued class, is evident enough on comparing the mortality 
rates. Whilst one third of the cases of typhoid fever proved fatal, 
only one twentieth of the cases of typho-malarial, and one eightieth 
of the cases of remittent fever, terminated fatally ! It is clear, 
therefore, that two thirds of the cases, so-called t3q;)ho-malarial, 
were cases of remittent fever only, and the remaining third were 
probably typhoid, complicated, it may be, with a malarial element. 
The foregoing statistics show as clearly as figures can, the fallacy of 



SCOKBUTIC ELEMENT. 195 

grouping into a class, indiscriminately, these essentially different 
forms of disease, which vary as much in mortality as in clinical 
features. 

The fevers of the army may be comprehended in two great 

classes : Classifica- 

Periodical ; feverfo?* 

Continued. *^^"""^- 

To the class of periodical fevers belong Intermittent, Remit- 
tent, Typho-Malarial (?). 

To the class of continued fevers belong Simple Continued Fever, 
Typhoid, Malarial Typhoid, Typhus. 

To consider all the above fonns, except intermittent fever, mod- 
ifications of one disease, is to do violence to the facts of Errorof con- 
pathology and morbid anatomy. It is assuming that tSeas*" 
causes in operation in army life produce results essen- ™ons*oTone 
tially different from those produced by the same causes in ^i^®*^- 
civil life. Over the great interior region of this continent, under 
conditions similar to those which obtain in the army, all these 
forms of fever prevail, — in the sparsely settled country districts 
and small towns, periodical fevers ; in the great centres of popula- 
tion, typhoid fever. The malarial element, all the facts go to show, 
diminishes rapidly as populations grow dense, its place being sup- 
plied with the typh element, which increases correspondingly. Our 
armies, in respect to these two elements in disease, had somewhat 
the same relation as large cities. That these diseases — Periodical 
and Continued — were sometimes more severe in the army, is not 
remarkable, but that they possessed new features, can hardly be 
admitted. 

Another element to which considerable importance has been 
assigned as influencing the symptomatology, the lesions, scorbutic 
and tlie mortality of camp fever is the so-called " scor- «^«°^^°*- 
butic taint." Dr. Woodward, in Circular No. 6, remarks, that 
" recognizable scurvy existed to a limited extent, and a scorbutic 
taint more or less pronounced, was a prominent phenomenon in 
most of the diseases of the war The scorbutic taint mani- 
fested itself very generally in the form of rheumatic pains in the 
back and limbs, associated with the scorbutic, clay-like appearance 
of the skin, sometimes even with sponginess of the gums, much 
more rarely with petechia), scorbutic discolorations about the flex- 
ure of the knee," etc. 

That recognizable scurvy existed to a limited extent, is obvious 
on examination of the statistics, there being but 1328 cases in the 



196 EXISTENCE OF TYPHO-MALARIAL FEVER. 

first year, and 7395 cases in the second year of the war. If it 
were possible to subtract from these numbers tlie cases of ordi- 
nary stomatitis, so commonly reported as scur\y, the aggregate 
would be considerably reduced. In a pretty extended course of 
observation, I did not meet, during the war, a single well-marked 
case of scorbutus. A scorbutic taint per se, cannot be separated 
from other causes constantly in operation to lower the health of the 
soldier. With as much propriety a scorbutic taint might be as- 
signed as a complicating condition in those severe cases of typhoid 
fever occurring amongst the ill-fed poor of our large cities. Cer- 
tainly, the typhus of the great famine periods in Ireland might, with 
much more propriety, be considered as modified by scorbutus. 
The case of lowered vitality, by reason of long deprivation of suit- 
able food, does favor the reception of the typh poison, and does 
increase the severity of the typhoid disease ; but that it adds some 
special character, which may be defined as the scorbutic type, can- 
not be admitted. Indeed, any one who has observed scorbutus on 
a scale of considerable magnitude, will not consider it as having 
any affinity with typhoid fever. Various intercurrent diseases oc- 
cur in the course of scorbutus, but not typhoid fever, unless the 
other conditions necessary for the development of the typh poison 
are present. 

I am convinced we shall better comprehend the true relation of 
camp fevers, if we consent to study them as they are, and not 
continue to view them through some medium which gives them a 
forced and unnatural configuration. 

Our armies during the war were subjected to a composite mor- 
composite ^^^^ causc — malaria, faulty alimentation, bad hygiene. 
Su^se'of The boundary line between these could with difficulty be 
*^^*'''^" traced in individual cases, at least so far as the signs and 

symptoms of disease are concerned. To arrive at a positive deter- 
mination, it was necessary, not alone to study the morbid anatomy, 
but to compare the symptomatolog}^ with the after-death appear- 
ances. I propose in the following pages to give the results of my 
observations made in both these modes of investigation. 

Is there a Typlio-Malayial Fever ? — The answer to this question 
Existence of iuvolvcs a discussiou of the relative influence of these two 
lariai fever, elements iu tlic production of camp fever. Dr. Wood- 
ward attempts to solve the problem by assuming that there is a 
malarial form, an enteric form, and a scorbutic form of camp 
fever (p. 141). In other words, that camp fever is a generic 
disease modified by malaria, by the typh element, or by scorbutus. 



STATISTICS OF REMITTENT AND TYPHOID FEVER. 197 

" As these diseases have occurred in our army during the pres- 
ent war, the phenomena of these two affections have continually 
complicated each other in the same patient ; so that in fact the 
enteric fevers have broken out among men campaig-ning in a mala- 
rial region, with constitutions more or less thoroughly impregnated 
with the malarial poison ; the remittents among soldiers, peculiarly 
prone by their exposures and mode of life to enteric disease ; and 
both have occuiTed almost without exception, in men whose health 
has been more or less modified by camp diet, and who are therefore 
suffering in some degree from a condition best characterized as the 
scorbutic taint. 

" These three modifying conditions or tendencies, each of which, 
when acting alone, might produce simple enteric fever, periodic 
fever, or scurvy, when acting simultaneously produced mixed types 
of disease that vary infinitely in accordance with the predominance 
of one or another of the three sets of determining conditions. For 
these variable resulting fevers, I proposed the general name of 
Typho-Malarial Fever, which in June, 1862, was, at my sugges- 
tion, adopted in the statistical nomenclature of the monthly reports 
of sick and wounded" (Circular No. 6, p. 109). 

Typho-malarial fever and camp fever are, in Dr. Woodward's 
view, synonymous terms. Studied by the symptomatology this 
fever is neither remittent nor continued, but partakes of the char- 
acter of both. Studied by the morbid anatomy, the diseased con- 
ditions are made up of the changes peculiar to both remittent and 
typhoid. There were, therefore, according to Woodward, really 
no cases wholly typhoid or wholly remittent in the army. If we 
admit this view, we must also admit that at the present time, 
among the denser populations of the interior continent, there are 
no cases unequivocally remittent or typhoid, for the causes indu- 
cing these modifications or mixing of types, obtain in this region as 
much as in the army. 

The army surgeons, most of whom were, probably, sufficiently 
familiar with the essential differences between remittent statistics of 
and t}-phoid fever, reported in the first year of the war and'EJp'hoid 
40,047 cases of remittent fever, and 370 deaths, and ^"^""• 
21,977 cases of typhoid and 6608 deaths; in the second year 
83,716 cases of remittent and 1167 deaths, and 31,374 cases of 
typhoid and 10,467 deaths ; of tj-pho-malarial 22,652 cases and 
1129 deaths. These statistics alone are conclusive against the 
position of Dr. Woodward. The mortality rates, also, exhibit, in 
the most striking manner, the essential differences between these 



198 COMPARISON OF TYPHOID AND REMITTENT FEVER. 



several forms of fever. For the first year of the war the mortahty 
of typhoid fever was about 1 in 4, and for the second year 1 in 3 ; 
of remittent, the mortahty was less than 1 in 100 for the first year, 
and 1 in 80 for the second ; and, lastly, of typho-malarial, the 
mortality was 1 in 20. 

Regarded from the clinical point of view^the difixirences were 
equally well defined. This may be better exhibited by a compara- 
tive statement. 

COMPARISON OF ARMY TYPHOID AND ARMY REMITTENT FEVER. 

Army Remittent. — A remittent 



Army Typhoid. — A distinctly 
continued fever, with daily exacer- 
bations, not more decided than has 
been usually observed in typhoid 
epidemics, e. g., Dr. Nathan Smith's 
account of epidemics in New Eng- 
land. 

Low delirium, subsultus, and 
stupor. 

Diarrhoea (pea-green stools) a 
constant symptom. 



Tympanites, gurgling and ten- 
derness in the right iliac region. 
Rose spots in one third. 
A dusky hue of the face. 



fever, of quotidian or tertian type, 
usually the latter, and exacerba- 
tions terminating in perspiration. 



No delirium nor stupor. 

Constipation. Frequently diar- 
rhoea, due to a cause to be presently 
stated, but the stools dark-colored 
and offensive. 

No tympanites, nor gurgling, nor 
tenderness in right iliac region. 

No characteristic eruption. 

Jaundice in some cases; bronz- 
ing of the skin in all the others. 

Duration from one to two weeks. 



Convalescence speedy. 

Mortality one in eighty. 

Thickening of solitary glands, 
fawn-colored liver, fleshy spleen, 
etc. 



Duration not less than three 
weeks. 

Convalescence slow. 

Mortality one in four. 

Thickening and ulceration of 
Peyer's patches, enlargement of 
the mesenteric glands, large and 
soft spleen, etc. 

Such are the broad and well-marked differences between the 
typhoid fever and the remittent fever of our army. A certain 
number of cases — the proportion is probably correctly expressed 
in the returns of the second year of the war — occupied a middle 
ground ; cases of typhoid fever complicated with a malarial ele- 
ment. Did the cases of periodical fever present any evidences of 
a typh complication ? Dr. Woodward's term — typho-malarial — 



CHARACTERISTIC ALTERATIONS. 199 

assumes that this was the case. Herein, I venture to affirm, lies 
the chief error in his views. A typh element did not, in my ex- 
perience, exhibit itself as a modifying condition in remittent fever. 
The statistics, especially the mortality rates, quoted from Circular 
No. 6, tell the same story. On the other hand, typhoid fever, oc- 
curring in an organism affected with the " chronic malarial poison- 
ing," was modified somewhat in its symptomatology but still more 
in its morbid anatomy. The impression of the malarial element 
was exhibited in heightening the daily exacerbation ; in other words, 
in a greater range of temperature ; in periodical sweats ; in a less 
degree of stupor and delirium ; in bronzing of the skin ; by the 
presence of bile pigment in the urine, and by other evidences 
of biliary derangement. As all these modifications in the symp- 
tomatology of typhoid fever may and do occur in regions not ma- 
larious, it would be impossible to associate them with a malarial 
complication, if they were not studied in the light of the morbid 
appearances after death. I have elsewhere been at some pains to 
show the changes induced in the organs by the slow absorption 
of the malarial poison. These changes may, but do not usually, 
produce the phenomena of periodical fever. They seem to occur, 
almost universally, according to my observation, in men subjected 
for a long time to small doses of the poison, not sufficient to Hght 
up fever, which is the resistance of the organism to the morbific 
influence. The comparative effect of these two methods of intro- 
ducing the malarial poison may be likened to the slow introduction 
of arsenic as contrasted with the effects of a poisonous dose. 

The alterations characteristic of chronic malarial poisoning were 
found in the following named organs : liver, spleen, the Alterations 
solitary glands of the small and large intestines, and the tic of chronic 
folhcles of LieberkiJhn. These changes may be ex- poisoning. 
pressed, summarily, in the following terms : aberration of pigment 
deposits and albuminoid degeneration of organs. The liver has 
a fawn color, and its cells are pale. Early in the course of the 
changes, the walls of the intestines are thin and transparent, the 
solitary glands just beginning to show themselves, and the patches 
of Peyer appearing as a slight cloud when the intestine is held up 
between the eye and the light. Tlie solitary glands continue to 
enlarge, and the whole surface of the mucous membrane in the 
ileum appears to be studded with them; the patches of Peyer 
become elevated a little above the general surface, and the epithe- 
lium covering them is soft and easily detached, and the follicles of 
Lieberkiihn become visible, owing to a deposit of pigment in their 



200 ETIOLOGY OF TYPHOID FEVER. 

orifices. A pigment deposit also takes place in the orifices of the 
flask-shaped glands of the large intestine. Coincidently with these " 
changes in the glandular apparatus of the intestine, the veins of 
the submucous coat enlarge. The spleen is full-sized, enlarged, 
fleshy, and firm, its trabeculse distinct, the splenic pulp deficient, 
and the Malpighian bodies remarkably increased in size. 

When, in a subject aflfected with these alterations, typhoid fever 
occurs, the lesions of typhoid are superadded to those of malaria. 
The alterations in the agminated patches and in the mesenteric 
glands appear to be unaffected by the malarial element. Dr. 
Woodward professes to have discovered some differences in the 
form of the ulcers, but after a candid examination of a considera- 
ble number of cases, I must be permitted to express my disbelief 
in the existence of such differences. 

The manner in which the malarial element modifies the typhoid 
disease, and the behavior of the two forms of poison under the 
same external conditions, are well exhibited in the disease known 
as " Moimtain Fever," the pecuHarities of which will be discussed 
in another part of this paper. 

CAUSES. 
T}^hoid fever, together with measles and mumps, etc., was the 
Etiology of seasoning process to which our soldiers were subjected on 
fever"' entering the army. Personal uncleanliness was one of 

the causes ; crowding in tents or quarters, ill-ventilated and im- 
perfectly policed, was another cause ; but the chief determining 
cause was the air of the camp, poisoned by organic emanations 
Emanations and privy gascs. My personal observations of the cir- 
the chief cumstances under which typhoid fever was developed in 
cause. the army, have convinced me that the importance of the 

last-named cause cannot be over-estimated. The cases of fever 
occurred most numerously where the diarrhoeal discharges were 
most abundant and most exposed to decomposition and dissemina- 
tion by the air and the water supply. Now, diarrhoea, as this 
volume sufficiently declares, was so common, that hardly any 
soldier served a few days or a few weeks without being affected 
with it. Badly constructed sinks within a few yards of the camp 
were the rule, and not unfrequently no sinks of any description 
were used, but the environs of the camp were converted into a 
general latrine. Privy odor was soon developed, and the drinking 
water contaminated. When sufficient time had elapsed, typhoid 
fever declared itself amongst those who had not completed the 



SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. — DEFINITION. 201 

seasoning process, or those who liad acquired a special suscepti- 
bility to the poison. That a certain time was requisite to give 
intensity to the morbific matter, is evident enough from the 
fact that troops on the march were not subject to typhoid 
fever, but a few weeks of detention in camp sufficed to develop 
the typh poison. On the other hand, camping and marching in a 
malarial region, without prolonged stay in one or a few camps, was 
attended with the periodical fevers. The peninsular campaign was 
an instance of the latter (Chickahominy fever), and the various 
winter or permanent camps were instances of the former (on the 
Potomac, siege of Yicksburg, winter at Chattanooga, etc.). 

I have observed some facts indicating the propagation of typhoid 
fever by contagion. Wards which had been occupied by Facts show- 
fever patients apparently became poisoned, and other giousness 

1 . 1 . 1 T 1 T 11 1 of typhoid 

cases admitted mto them were exceedmgly liable to be fever, 
attacked with typhoid fever. This occurred in Ward 1, National 
Hotel Hospital, Baltimore, so frequently, that the disuse of it by 
wounded became imperatively necessary. The same circumstance 
was observed at Lincoln Hospital, Washington, and I doubt not at 
eveiy hospital in which sick and wounded were alike received. I 
have also seen three instances in which patients contracted fever 
whilst lying alongside of typhoid cases, and subjected to the ema- 
nations both from the person and from the dejections. The particu- 
lar influence of the peculiar typhoid stools has not been exhibited 
in any facts coming to my knowledge. It has seemed to me, how- 
ever, after pretty extensive observation, that stools of ordinary 
diarrhoea and dysentery, when in state of change after exposure to 
the action of the atmosphere, were the principal factors in the 
causation of army typhoid. 

SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. 

This affection may be defined as follows : A continuous febrile 
state, with an exacerbation toward evening, lastinp; from

seven to ten days, and having a strong tendency to ter- 
minate after the sixth day by a critical evacuation — by diapho- 
resis, by diarrhoea, by a free discharge of urine with a great increase 
of urates, etc. The fever is accompanied by the usual symptoms 
of that state — anorexia, constipation, diminished urinary excre- 
tion, dryness of the skin, and hebetude of mind, but witliout de- 
lirium. Fatigue, anxiety of mind, exhausting drill, suppressed 
perspiration, organic emanations, foul effluvia, etc., were the 
apparent causes. 



202 MOUNTAIN FEVER. 

For tlie first year of the war 11,771 cases of common continued 
Number of ^ver Were reported, and of these but 146 proved fatal. 
cases. jyj-y ^^^ observatious warrant me in saying that these 

figures represent very nearly the degree of prevalence of that dis- 
ease which I have ventured to denominate " simple continued 
fever." Having seen no fatal case of it, I am inclined to regard 
those reported fatal as cases of typhoid. It is to be regretted that 
this term — common continued fever — was no longer employed 
after the first year of the war, and that the cases reported under 
it were assigned to the typho-malarial class chiefly. 

This fever occurred principally amongst the recruits and young 
Occurrence soldicrs, who wcrc, of coursc, more susceptible to the 
cruits''and actiou of the causcs. It is not imyjrobable that this simple 
soldiers. coutinucd fcvcr may be aggravated into typhoid if the 
state of the organism and other necessary conditions be favorable. 
So long as the development of a febrile state does not proceed to 
the formation of typhoid, we may assume that the poison matter, 
whatever may be its nature, — organic emanations, foul effluvia, 
etc., — has not yet attained sufficient intensity, or that the vital 
power of the organism is not enough reduced. Sufficient poison 
gains admittance, however, to produce a disturbance of the blood 
and consequent interference in the functions of the excretory organs. 
The febrile state is the reaction against the presence of these ex- 
traneous matters in the organism. The cases which have occurred 
under my observation having terminated favorably, no opportunity 
has occurred for the study of the morbid anatomy. There is not, 
probably, any specific anatomical lesion. 

The laws governing the modification of continued fever by a 
malarial element, or the true relations existing between the mala- 
rial and typh elements in the so-called mixed types, are clearly 
exemplified in that form of fever known as Mountain Fever. It 
will, therefore, conduce to a better understanding of the subject in 
hand to investigate the nature and causes of this fever. Further- 
more, as mountain fever occurred amongst our troops operating 
in. the elevated regions of the Rocky Mountains, it is proper to 
make some allusion to that disease in this place. 

MOUNTAIN FEVER. 

My personal observations of this disease were made during a 
service of two years in the territory of Utah, before the outbreak 
of the rebellion. During the late war cases occurred amongst our 
volunteer forces serving in Utah, Montana, and the other moun- 
tain territories. 



MALARIAL ORIGIN OF MOUNTAIN FEVER. 



203 



The first account of this disease, which was by Dr. Ewing, ap- 
peared in the " St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal " ^^ j,^.^g 
for March, 1855. A report made by me to the Surgeon- gau^g^^.^'"' 
General on the medical topogi'aphy and diseases of Fort '^'*"''*- 
Bridger, Utah, including a description of mountain fever, was pub- 
lished in the "American Journal of the Medical Sciences" for 
April, 1860. In the sixteenth volume of the " Transactions of the 
American Medical Association," there is a fall and elaborate paper 
on the medical topography and epidemics of California, by Dr. 
Thomas M. Logan, which contains an abstract of my paper on the 
subject of mountain fever. 

According to Dr. Ewing, mountain fever occurs only at an alti- 
tude of about 7000 feet, and is a disease sui generis, produced in 
some mysterious way by rarefied air. This opinion, it appears to 
me, is not at all justified by the facts. My observations are cor- 
roborated by those of Dr. Logan. " Dr. Bartholow's views coin- 
cide so nearly with our experience in cases of this form of disease, 
among travellers returning from Nevada Territory, that we cannot 
do better than adopt his description entire " (p. 550). 

In my report I have remarked as follows : " I do not hesitate 
to declare my conviction that the periodical form of moun- 
tain fever is a disease of malarial origin, modified by ele- 
vation and rarefied air. The cases which occurred in the ' army 
of Utah,' happened in those men who had served in Kansas, and 
been exposed to the miasma of the Platte Valley, on the march 
over the plains. I saw other cases, and the most violent, amongst 
teamsters fr'om Missouri and Illinois, who had frequently suifered 
attacks of undoubted malarial fever. The ordinary intermittents 
and remittents of the Platte Valley, gradually changed in charac- 
ter as the troops ascended the table lands of the Rocky Mountains, 
until, having reached the South Pass, they merged into that febrile 
state already described. Those attacks which, it is alleged, have 
occurred amongst the habitues of the mountains, are not well autlien- 
ticated cases of periodical fever, but were rather typhoid modified, 
as I have already shown that affection is, by elevation. In Salt Lake 
Valley, mountain fever is extremely common amongst the newly 
arrived emigrants, much less so amongst the resident inhabitants, 
who have, midoubtedly, typhoid fever, but confounded with the peri- 
odical fever, and both known under the same local designation." 

The origin of mountain fever is briefly indicated in the foregoing 
extract. The command with which I served had been encamped 
for some weeks on the banks of the Missouri, near Fort Leaven-

204 REMITTENT FORM OF MOUNTAIN FEVER. 

wortli, a malarious district, and had subsequently marched and en- 
camped in other malarious districts in Kansas. Cases of periodical 
fever occurred amongst them. Two months afterward, when we 
reached the vicinity of the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, 
intermittent and remittent fevers appeared in considerable num- 
bers. When we arrived in Utah, the command remained in camp 
for several weeks in the valley of Ham'.s Fork, a tributary of Green 
River. The elevation was about 6000 feet, but the weather for 
the season was warm. Whilst encamped in this valley, typhoid 
fever manifested itself, and the cases of remittent increased in 
number. There were then two forms of the so-called mountain 
fever. ' Following Dr. Woodward's example, I might have des- 
ignated the one, the malarial form of mountain fever, and the 
other, the typhoid form ; but as the two diseases are essentially 
distinct, there could be no propriety in associating them under one 
name. The term " mountain fever " is obviously a misnomer, the 
occurrence of these diseases in that elevated region being merely 
accidental and not due to any specific cause peculiar to that local- 
ity. Having quoted Dr. Logan's approval of my views in general, 
I should not omit to mention, that he " cannot altogether agree 
with me, that the periodical form of mountain fever is always found 
among those who may have recently ascended from the low mala- 
rial regions into the more elevated It must be confessed, 

however, that the type of the fever was somewhat clouded." 

I extract from my report a description of the remittent and 
Remittent typlioid forms of mountain fever, to exhibit somewhat 
forms. more clearly the differences between them. 

I. Remittent Form of Mountain Fever. — " All cases were ush- 
ered in by a chill, more or less decided, which lasted a variable 
period. In the febrile stage the pulse was full, quick, frequent but 
soft, and sometimes dicrotic ; the skin hot, dry, and mordicant ; the 
tongue heavily furred in the centre, red and dry at the tip and 
edges. There were present, also, intense cephalalgia, aching in 
the back and limbs, suffusion of the eyes, loathing of food, and 
sometimes nausea and vomiting. Delirium occurred in several 
cases during the exacerbations. The remissions were characterized 
by debility, listlessness, indisposition to the slightest exertion of 
body or mind, and a most painful aching of the limbs. The coun- 
tenance, at these periods, was vacant, dull, and tinged a dirtv- 
yellow ; the pulse small, quick, and irritable ; the skin moist and 
perspiring, but the sweating was never profiise. Dian'hcea was a 
frequent symptom; the stools were thin, yellowish, watery, and 



INTERMIXTURE OF TYPHOID AND REMITTENT TYPE. 205 

offensive — occasionally greenish, dark-brown or black. The urine 
was usually scanty, and deposited an abundant lateritious sediment. 
The chill was not regular in duration, nor did it usually amount to 
a distinct rigor, and the febrile reaction was extremely gradual in 
its approach. In some instances the two stages were coincident, 
and during the highest excitement, a sense of chillhiess was ex- 
perienced. The appearance of the tongue was peculiar — heavily 
loaded with whitish fur, through which enlarged papillae protruded, 
like the strawberry tongue of scarlatina. The most painful, as 
w^ell as persistent symptom, was the aching of the back and limbs. 
Having suffered an attack in proprid persona, I can testify to the 
acuteness of these pains. By some officers of the army, who had 
had some experience with the dengue, it was likened to that affec- 
tion, and bore amongst them the name of ' break-bone fever.' 
There was little regularity in the paroxysms, either in duration 
or periods of recurrence." 

II. Typhoid Form of Mountain Fever. — After stating that the 
" typhoid cases during the early stage (first week) were remit- 
tent," the report proceeds as follows : " The typhoid fever of Utah 
has other peculiarities beside the occurrence of remissions. Many 
of those general symptoms so characteristic were wanting : coma, 
subsultus tendinum, muttering delirium, floccitatio ; but in all were 
present some mental disturbance and stupor, cophosis, epistaxis, 
gurgling on pressure over the ileo-caecal valve, pea-green watery 
stools ; in two instances the ' rose spots,' and frequently the suda- 
mina and sour-smelling perspirations. All the fatal cases were 
submitted to a post-mortem examination, and the characteristic 
lesions of typhoid fever invariably found." 

The occurrence of remittent and typhoid fever in those ele- 
vated regions of the Rocky Mountains, remote from the sources of 
the one, and apparently without the conditions necessary to pro- 
duce the other, is a remarkable circumstance, to the elucidation 
of which we may, profitably, apply attentive study. 

Both remittent and typhoid fever exhibited some aberrations from 
the typical forms of those diseases. Were these aberrations intermixt- 
clue to the dimmished barometric pressure, or Avere the typhoid and 

^ ' the remit- 

two types intermixed ? The manifestations of the mala- teat type. 
rial poison are so protean, that w^e may answer the first question 
in the negative. The aberrations noted in the paroxysms of the 
mountain remittent, are not more remarkable than those occasion- 
ally observed in regions, unequivocally malarious ; but, especially, 
they are not more remarkable than is observed commonly, in cases

of periodical fever occurring at the North, in persons subjected, for 
a considerable period previously, to the action of malaria in the 
South. The typhoid cases occuiTed in those who had absorbed 
more or less of the malarial poison whilst sojourning in the mala- 
rial regions of Kansas. In the first week, as we have seen, the 
malarial element asserted itself in giving a certain degree of perio- 
dicity to the symptoms, but afterward, this influence was no longer 
perceived, and the cases proceeded in the way characteristic of 
typhoid disease. 

The source of the malarial poisoning is evident. The ascent in- 
Sources of to an clcvated region only, gave renewed 'dciivitj to the

and the morbific matter. Inere are certamly none ot the condi- 
poison. tions present at the South Pass, to develop malaria. The 

source of the typh poison may not be so clear. A study of the 
facts presented in the previous part of this paper, will result in the 
conclusion that every encampment of soldiers, if in existence a few 
weeks, has in it the material for the generation of the poison of 
typhoid fever. 

I have not alluded to typhus fever as one of the forms of camp 
Typhus fever, for the reason that I have no knowledge of it from 
fever. personal observation. That cases occurred, especially at 

Annapolis, amongst our returned prisoners, seems probable. Cer- 
tainly, the description of these cases, by credible medical officers, 
was strikingly similar to the accounts of typhus as seen in the 
great famine periods ift Ireland. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

I may now present, in the form of conclusions, certain proposi- 
tions, which appear to me to be true in respect to the fevers of the 
army. 

1. Camp fever consists of several distinct febrile affec- 
tions : — 

Kemittent ; 

Simple Continued Fever ; 

Typhoid, with or without a Malarial Complication ; 

Typhus. 
- 2. Remittent and Typhoid are chnically and pathologically dis- 
tinct. 

3. A malarial element may exist as a complication in typhoid 
fever, or, more properly, typhoid may occur in a person affected 
with chronic malarial poisoning. 

4. The term — typho-malarial fever — does not express the true 
relation of the malarial to the typh element. 



STATISTICS OF PERIODICAL FEVERS. 207 

5. Malarial fever and clironlc malarial poisoning, are clinically 
distinct. 

6. When the typh poison is not abundant, a simple continued 
fever may be produced. 

7. Typhoid supersedes periodical fever in malarious districts 
when populations become dense, and in the army when the same 
conditions obtain as in civil Hfe, e. g.^ croAvding, organic effluvia, 
animal debris^ excreta, etc. 

REPLIES OF MEDICAL OFFICERS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING CAMP 
FEVERS : REMITTENT AND INTERMITTENT, TYPHOID, AND TYPHO- 
MALARIAL. 

The prevalence of fevers in the armies of the United States dur- 
ing the rebellion is shown by the statistics contained in statistics of 
Dr. Woodward's report, to which reference has been made the first two 
in the foregoing paper by Dr. Bartholow. During the rebellion. 
first year of the war, the whole number of cases in the armies of 
the United States was 74,619, the number of deaths being 6315 ; 
during the second year the number of cases was 138,641, and the 
number of deaths 13,144, making the total for the two years 213,- 
260 cases, and 19,459 deaths.^ During each of these years about 
one quarter of the men suffered from some form of fever, and the 
deaths from fever amounted to two per cent, of the strength. 
" The whole number of deaths from fevers during the first year 
was nearly one half the total mortality from disease ; during the 
second year, owing to the increased mortality from other diseases, 
the number was only one third the total mortality fr'om disease, 
though still maintaining nearly the same ratio to strength." The 
Circular, issued by the Medical Committee of the Sanitary Commis- 
sion, contained several questions relating to periodical and continued 
fevers. The remainder of this chapter will be devoted to some of 
the replies of medical officers to these questions. The replies will 
be arranged into — Firsts those relating to remittent and intermittent 
fever ; Second^ those relating to the continued fevers ; and, Thirds 
those relating to typho-malarial fever. 

REMITTENT AND INTERMITTENT FEYER. 

Statistics showing the number of cases of periodical fevers or of 
other diseases, occurring in the armies of the United States statistics of 
during the war, could not, of course, be obtained directly feTera."^ 
by the Sanitary Commission. According to Dr. Woodward'S^

1865. 



208 REMITTENT AND INTERMITTENT FEVER. 

report, which is based on the returns made to the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral's Office, there were 262,807 cases of intermittent fever during 
the first two years of the war, of which 1788 cases ended fatally ; 
the annual ratio of cases per 1000 of mean strength being 298.64, 
and of deaths 1.91. In a large proportion of the fatal cases the 
disease was of the form generally called by writers " pernicious," 
and commonly known in this country as " congestive intermittent 
fever." Excluding cases of pernicious intermittent fever, the mor- 
tality is reduced to 407 deaths during the two years, or one death 
to every 631 cases ! Dr. AYoodward considers that probably in 
some of the cases of supposed death from congestive intermittent 
fever, the disease was cerebro-spinal meningitis. Cases of inter- 
mittent fever were more rife, throughout all parts of the country, in 
September and October, than during any other months of the year. 

Of remittent fever, during the first two years of the war, the 
number of cases was 123,763, and the number of deaths 1537. 

The agency of malarial poisoning upon diseases and the results 
of surgery in the war, has been considered in the first section of this 
volume ; also, the prophylactic employment of quinia. Aside from 
these points of inquiry, an examination of the reports which have 
been made to the Sanitary Commission, fails to develop any thing 
which can be presented as an important addition to existing knowl- 
edge. To the inquiry as to " any important facts observed in ref- 
erence to the topographical and meteorological conditions that have 
concurred in giving origin or intensity to malarial disease in the 
localities where it has prevailed," nothing worthy of especial note 
is contained in the replies of numerous correspondents. This 
statement is also to be made with respect to the management of 
intermittent and remittent fever. 

The following extract from a communication made by Surgeon 
Extract from H. W. Clark, 15tli Infantry, Ohio Volunteers, dated near 
tion by Sur- Sau Autouio, Tcxas, October, 1865, is interesting, as 
Clark. showing the effect of a removal from highly malarious 

districts to a healthful situation : — 

" On the Mississippi River, and at Green Lake, Texas, and between 
these points and this place, our camps were on low, flat ground, in order 
that we might be near water. The days were excessively hot, and the 
nights quite cool. By these circumstances I account for the occurrence of 
a large number of cases of intermittent and remittent fever which then 
for the first time appeared ; as previously we had never encamped on 
such ground, nor had to drink such water as that from the Lower Missis- 
sippi and the stagnant ponds of the Texas coast. We are now encamped

on a high and dry prairie, without shade, except from arbors constructed 
with brush and long weeds, and our camps are well supplied with good 
spring water. The result is, that malarial diseases have almost entirely 
disappeared, and instead of using an ounce of quinia daily, that quan- 
tity is sufficient for two weeks." 

The following communication from Surgeon John A. Lidell, U. 
S. Volunteers, and Inspector of the Medical Department, communica- 
army of the Potomac, gives the relative proportion of surgeo^ 
cases of intermittent, remittent, and typhoid fever, in one ^^^^' 
brigade, in the valley of the Potomac, December, 1861 : —

the monthly reports of the surgeons of the several regiments composing 
Burns's (late Baker's) Brigade, exhibited the following statistics with 
respect to fevers of all kinds during the month of December, 1861 : —

" The above-mentioned brigade had an aggregate of 4200 officers and 
men present. The above schedule embraoes all the cases of fever 
reported. None of them were transferred to general hospital, but all 
of them were treated in the regimental hospitals at the camp. No death 
was attributed to either intermittent or remittent fever. Every case of 
typhoid fever (fever with the enteric lesion) was complicated with diffi- 
culties of a malarial origin, which required the administration of quinia 
in large doses a few times for their removal. 

" The table given above shows that the prevailing type of malarial 
fever, during the month of December, 1861, in the Valley of the Poto- 
mac near the mouth of the Monocacy River, where Burns's Brigade was 
then stationed, was remittent fever." 

Surgeon George D. Miller, 5th Infantry, Wisconsin surgeon Oeo, 
Volunteers, makes the following statement : — statement 

" Hot days, with cold, damp nights, on damp ground, in shady groves, 
or in living timber, or on cold camping-grounds, have seemed to cause,

weather following rainy and damp weather after midsummer. It was 
far more intense in the South than I ever knew it in any place North." 

With reference to the effects of malaria beiiio; manifested in 
Surgeon connection with other diseases rather than by the produc- 
for^'com-^ tion of intermittent and remittent fever, and, also, to the 
munication. protection afforded by previous exposure to malaria, Sur- 
geon F. H. Windsor, 49th Infantry, Massachusetts Volunteers, 
thus writes : — 

"Not one eighth of my men off duty^ had pure malarial disease, 
whether intermittent or remittent, but the malarial influence showed 
itself in a very large proportion of the cases of other diseases, and 
there could be no doubt that in proportion to the absence of malarial 
disease in the homes of the regiments in that army was their suffering 
from the climate. This was the opinion of very many surgeons in the 
same division. In other words, the suffering from malaria was in 
inverse proportion to the extent to which the men had been acclimated 
to it at home." 

Surgeon Samuel Flagg says : " Localities where malarial diseases 
Surgeon prevail with the greatest severity were in the vicinity of 
ItSg? shallow, sluggish rivers ; probably felling of large tracts

malaria." 

Assistant-Surgeon Gennet, 17th Infantry, Ohio Volunteers, 
SurgSn*' gives the following account of the circumstances under 
Snt*.* ^ ^' which malarial diseases were suddenly developed : — 

" At Anderson Station, near Stevenson, Alabama, we were encamped 
upon the banks of rather a sluggish mountain stream (Crow's Creek), 
with heavy dews and cold nights, and very hot days, in August and 
September, 1863. Malarial diseases suddenly appeared, but by pro- 
hibiting bathing at midday, by giving more freely of vegetables (green 
corn, potatoes, and peaches), and less meat, and the prophylactic use of 
quinine with the more feeble ones of our command, much was done to 
lessen the severity and the frequency of this class of diseases." 

Assistant- Assistaut-Surgcon Samuel W. Abbott, U. S. Navy, 

Samuel w. tlius testifies to the immediate effect of the atmosj^here 
testimony, of the opeu sca ou the effects of malaria : — 

" The crews of the fleet in James River, in the summer of 1862, 

suffered much from intestinal complaints, — a portion of the fleet being 

anchored at Harrison's Landing, and along the marshes below that 

,place. On my own vessel, the Tioga, frequently twenty-five per cent.

INFEEQUENCY OF TYPHUS FEVER. 211 

of the crew were unfit for duty. Fevers of a malarial type were 
prevalent, also diarrhoea and dysentery. I attributed much of the 
diarrhoea to the fact that the crews of many vessels drank the water of 
the James River, which had become foul with the offal of thousands of 
men and beasts who daily bathed in these waters at Harrison's Landing. 
Not many miles below, the Chickahominy emptied its waters, after 
flowing through a score of malarious swamps. These waters ebb and 
flow with the sluggish tide for many miles up the river. 

" A few days at Hampton Roads in September, with exposure to the 
refreshing sea-breeze, greatly improved the health of the fleet." 

" I have observed the healthful influence exerted on the crews of 
vessels by a sudden transition from the malaria of an inland river to 
the open sea, and vice versa.''

the increased tolerance of this remedy in this form of malarious 
disease. The letter is dated Hilton Head, S. C, December 4, 
1861 : — 

"The congestive fever, or 'pernicious,' takes hold of us rather 
severely. Our next neighbors of the Ninth Maine have suffered greatly. 
The disease calls for the most energetic treatment. I did not dare tell 
any one that I had given one man one hundred and twenty grains of 
quinine between seven a. m. and twelve midnight, until I saw tliat he 
was sure to get well. Strange to say, it produced no cinchonism, and 
the patient will soon return to duty." 

THE CONTINUED FEVERS. 

The reports elicited by the Circular of the Medical Committee 
contain but little respecting typhus and typhoid fevers, infrequency 

Tx • -1 n \ o 1 of typhus 

It is certain that cases or typhus lever were, to say the fever, 
least, very infrequent in the armies of the United States during 
the war. The returns to the Surgeon-General's Office, according 
to Dr. Woodward's report, in the first two years of the war, con- 
tained 1723 cases, and 572 deaths. Dr. Woodward, however, 
states that in many of these cases the disease was not true typhus, 
but either typhoid or typho-malarial fever. The infrequency 
of typhus in the camps during the war, or, perhaps, even their 
entire immunity from this species of fever, is important, as bearing 
on the question, whether the miasm producing the disease is gener- 
ated in the concentrated effiuvia from the iDodies of healthy per- 



212 WALKING CASES OF TYPHOID FEVER. 

sons ; in other words, whether this disease be ever a result exclu- 
sively of crowd-poisoning. That the accumulation of emanations 
from the living body, and other consequences of over-crowding and 
defective ventilation, may play an important part in the develop- 
ment of typhus, is doubtless true ; but the question is, whether 
these circumstances are alone sufficient for the production of the 
special miasm, or whether they act only as accessory causes. The 
absence of typhus fever in the Andersonville Prison, where a large 
number of our troops were confined for a long time, with insuffi- 
ciency of food, and under other depressing circumstances, is a note- 
worthy fact which will appear in Section Third of this volume. 

Cases of fever, considered as typhoid, were numerous during the 
Frequency war. The statistics embodied in Dr. Woodward's report 
fever. for the first two years show 53,351 cases, and 16,075 

deaths. There is an abundance of testimony going to show 
that the phenomena of tyj)hoid and of remittent fever were 
frequently intermingled to such an extent that it was often difficidt 
to determine whether the disease was to be considered as the 
former or as the latter of these two fevers. From this difficulty 
arose the custom of applying the name camp fever in doubtful 
cases ; and in June, 1862, the term typho-malarial fever, proposed 
by Dr. Woodward, was adopted in the statistical nomenclature of 
the monthly reports. In view of these facts, it is doubtfid to what 
extent cases set down as cases of ty]^)hoid fever exemplified this 
disease disconnected from malarial influence ; and hence, testi- 
mony relating to simple or pure typhoid fever is not only meagre 
but open to a certain amount of distrust. 

The Circular issued by the Medical Committee of the Commis- 
sion contained the following inquiries : " Has the typhoid fever 
which you have observed in camps and hospitals been characterized 
by well-defined periodicity at any stage ? At what stage ? In 
what localities, seasons, and circumstances ? Did the administra- 
tion of quinia produce injurious or beneficial effects in such 
cases ? " Some of the correspondents have replied to these ques- 
tions. The answers, however, are not sufficiently definite and frill 
to warrant any important conclusions. 

Walking Two " Walking cases " of typhoid fever, reported by 

typhoid Surgeon John A. Lidell, are worthy of being placed on

Case 1. — "A young infantry soldier was brought from the front to 
the depot field hospital of the Fiflh Corps, at City Point, Dec. 12, 1864. 
He was walking about the hospital camp, on the 13th and 14th, com-

plaining of debility and malaria. He died unexpectedly on the morn- 
ing of the 15th. 

^''Autopsy a few hours after death : — Rigor mortis strong ; adipose tissue 
scanty, but the muscular development fair ; lungs sound ; no pleuritic 
adhesions ; pericardium contained about two ounces of pale straw-col- 
ored serum ; there was a white patch of old flocculent and firm false 
membrane, about the size of a dime, on the left ventricle of the heart, 
near its apex ; it had evidently resulted from the giving way of an old 
adhesion between the visceral and parietal pericardium ; there were two 
small milk-spots on the right ventricle ; the visceral pericardium was in 
general considerably more opaque than natural (opalescent) ; this mem- 
brane also appeared to be somewhat reddened, as if recently stained, over 
the septum ventriculorum on the front of the organ, but there was no 
plastic exudation ; the heart was somewhat (a trifle) larger than natural. 
The spleen was moderately enlarged and more consistent than natu- 
ral (moderate hypertrophy with induration). The liver, pancreas, and 
kidneys appeared to be normal. The stomach was distended with a 
quantity of milk-and-water colored liquid, together with some gas. The 
ileum was contracted and generally colored dark-red, especially in the 
lower portion of it. Peyer's patches were raised from one to two lines 
above the surrounding mucous surface, and many of them showed exca- 
vated ulcerations surrounded by elevated margins. They were oval in 
shape, situated on the side of the intestine opposite the mesenteric at- 
tachment, and their long axes corresponded with the long axis of the 
digestive tube. Many of the solitary glands exhibited enlargement and 
ulceration (circular). The mucous membrane of all the lower part of 
the ileum was dark-red and softened. The contents of both the large 
and small intestines were dark in color and normal in consistence, show- 
ing that diarrhoea had not yet been developed as a symptom. Many of 
the mesenteric glands were reddened in color, and enlarged so as to 
vary in size from a small bean to a filbert, and even to a greater size 
than that in a few instances. The muscles were bright red in color. 
The blood contained in the large vessels presented a dull watery cherry- 
red color or appearance. The coagula also were small." 

Case 2. — " Private Jackson, belonging to the 71st Pennsylvania Vol- 
unteers, died rather unexpectedly Oct. 14, 1861. Dr. Dwindle informs 
me that he had been in the regimental field hospital about ten days, suf- 
fering from symptoms of fever, with prostration and diarrhcea, which, 
however, were readily controlled by remedies. The prostration was not 
marked, for the patient insisted on dressing himself and sitting up on 
the afternoon before his death. His tongue had been inclined to be 
dry, and he had had moderate delirium, especially at night, for several 
days. On coming to the hospital he stated that he had been unwell for 
several days. The treatment consisted in the administration of quinine 
as a tonic and antiperiodic ; of opium, to restrain his diarrhcea ; of nu-

triments, such as beef-tea, farina, etc., and the application of epispastics 
to his abdomen. The hospital attendants state that he rose in the night 
apparently to use the close stool, that he suddenly sank down backwards 
as if he had fainted, and immediately, or in a very short time, expired. 

" Autopsy eight hours after death : — Cadaver somewhat emaciated ; 
rose-colored spots on chest and abdomen ; abdominal walls contracted ; 
muscles red ; small intestines, ^specially lower part of ileum, reddened, 
and the capillary vessels present an injected appearance; mesenteric 
glands much larger than natural, and pale-red in color ; on opening the 
lower portion of the ileum, Peyer's patches are found to be raised one 
or two lines above the surrounding surface, oval in shape, with ulcera- 
tions of varying depth in the interior of the patches which caused them 
to have elevated and everted edges, and a ragged, uneven base. The 
largest patch of typhoid deposit and ulceration was fully one and 
one half inches in its long diameter. Thus it was seen that the enteric 
lesion of typhoid fever was very well shown. The contents of the 
ileum were semi-fluid and yellowish in color. The intestines were not 
flatulent." 

TYPHO-MALARIAL FEVER. 

The general favor vrith vrhich the term t}^ho-malarial has been 
Proper sense ^eceived, aiid the readiness with which it has come into 
tjVho^-ma^ vogue, show that it expresses a pathological doctrine con- 
lariai. sistent with clinical experience. As contended by the 

writer of the first portion of this chapter, the term properly de- 
notes the conjoined operation of malaria and the special cause of 
typhoid fever ; in other words, it should be restricted to cases in 
which periodical fever and typhoid fever are united. The blend- 
ing of these two forms of fever is not a new doctrine. It has been 
taught for many years by Professor Dickson, and by other medical 
teachers in this countr}'-, in place of the doctrine that periodical 
fever is liable to conversion into typhoid fever. But the typhoid 
disease thus produced had not acquired a nosological place and 
name prior to the introduction of the term by Dr. Woodward. 
An important result of medical experience during the war is the 
establishment of the claims of a disease, presenting typho-malarial 
or malarial typhoid characters to be considered as a separate form 
of fever, its symptomatic features varying much in different cases, 
according as the malarial or the typhoid phenomena preponderate. 
The name, typho-malarial, was adopted in the monthly reports in 
June, 1862. During the following year there were reported under 
this name 22,652 cases, of which 1129 died. 

The institution of a new form of fever in the nosology must

needs lead to considerable confusion until its diagnostic characters 
are fully ascertained. The points in the differential diagnosis, as 
contrasted, on the one hand, with pure typhoid fever, and, on the 
other hand, with simple or unmixed remittent fever, require, in 
addition to abundant data, considerable time and labor for their full 
elucidation. The clinical history of typho-malarial fever is, of 
course, to be based on the results of the analysis of a large num- 
ber of cases carefully recorded by competent observers. The com- 
munications in the hands of the Commission do not embrace the 
materials for such an investigation, nor for investigating the etiol- 
ogy and determining the comparative effects of different methods 
of treatment. We must content ourselves here with a few brief 
extracts from the replies to the Circular issued by the Medical 
Committee. 

Surgeon O. Everts, whose observations were confined mostly to 
camps in Virginia, writes as follows : — 

"The fevers usually reported as continued, remittent, typhoid, ty- 
phus, or typho-malarial, were, according to my judgment, in Surgeon 
general essentially one and the same. Cases of pure mala- opinion. 
rial fever, I think, were rare." 

Dr. Everts is of the opinion that the typhoid phenomena were 
often attributable to the injudicious use of active cathartics. He 
thinks that defective alimentation, and especially the bad prepara- 
tion of food, contributed largely to the production of typho-malarial 
fever. 

The following extract is from a communication fi'om Surgeon 
A. S. Coe : — 

" Typho-malarial fever was endemic at Kelly's Ford, Va., in the winter 
of 1863-64. After the Mine Run campaign we went into Extract from 

J. TT- n » -r^ 1 m» . . /, , , communica- 

camp at Kelly s t ord. The situation of our camp was bad tion by sar- 
in the extreme ; it was low and swampy, with a thick vegeta- coe° 
ble mould on the surface, and a clay sub-soil underneath ; water could 
be procured by digging six inches below the surface at all times. Soon 
after our arrival typho-malarial fever prevailed to an alarming extent. 
We soon afler were ordered to Culpepper, and went into winter-quarters 
about one and a half miles northwest of the town. The health of the 
troops immediately began to improve, and soon there was almost an en- 
tire absence of sickness of any sort. In one sense of the term nearly all 
prevailing diseases of a camp might be called endemic — they are inva- 
riably influenced and modified by causes peculiar to camps. The fevers 
of camps are of a mixed character, arising from a blending of the two 
kinds of poison. A pure type of remittent fever, according to my ob- 
servation, is very rare, and I have seen but a few cases of typhoid fever

with tympanites and ulcerated bowels since entering the field. The 
term typho-malarial is very properly applied to the prevailing form of 
fever." 

The following is communicated by Surgeon William A. Harvey, 
of the Sickle U. S. Army General Hospital, Alexandria, Va. : — 

" I cannot say that I have seen a case of pure, unmixed typhoid

munication. attending the sick in the General Hospital and in the field. 

*' I have met with cases exhibiting in part the symptoms and signs 
characteristic of this fever, but almost uniformly with others so foreign 
that the disease was plainly entitled to some other name. The army 
fever is typho-malarial. This fever is shorter in its course than typhoid, 
and in a larger proportion of cases proves fatal. This is owing un- 
doubtedly to the scorbutic condition of army patients, and the various 
causes impoverishing the blood — the same conditions which render 
secondary hemorrhage so fearful and fatal in surgical cases. 

" 1 have seen no typhus in the army. There was a class of cases of 
rather unfrequent occurrence, in which were extreme debility with 
fever, ecchymosed blotches over nearly the whole surface, and consti- 
pation. These cases I was in the habit, at first, of calling cases of 
typhus ; but subsequent observation and reading convinced me that 
they were cases of typho-malarial fever occurring in scorbutic persons. 
They were generally fatal. The type of this fever is uniformly low, 
demanding tonics and stimulants almost from its inception. I am not 
aware that this fever is preventible by any known means, other than 
exclusion from the exciting and predisposing causes. I have observed 
that the new troops from the North were liable to be attacked within 
six weeks from first exposure ; afterwards the immunity was quite com- 
plete. I have no evidence of the contagiousness of this fever." 

Prof. Frank H. Hamilton, late Medical Inspector U. S. Army, 
Cases report- ^^^ commuuicated an account of gangrene of the toes 
spectoJF.H. occurring as a sequel of camp fever, in ten cases at 
Hamilton. David's Iskud Hospital, Long Island Sound, in June, 
1865. These cases were under the charge of Dr. Keitland, at 
David's Island, and previously under the charge of Acting Assist- 
ant-Surgeon Martindale. The following is the account in the 
language of the reporter : — 

" Ten men were admitted with gangrene of the toes and feet, and about 
thirty more were admitted at the same time into this general hospital. 
Corporal Matthews says that in his own case, and in all the cases which 
he saw, the toes were, from the first, dry and black (dry gangrene). All 
these patients had been in the prisons in Florence, S. C. All had fever 
before the gangrene occurred. The fever was called " camp feverP 



GANGRENE RESULTING FROM "CAMP FEVER." 21T 

Matthews was in Florence about three months. He never had meat 
during this period — neither fresh or salt — (from November until Feb- 
ruary 28th, 1865). Another patient, Kimball, was also four months at 
Camp Sumpter, Andersonville, where he had salt or fresh beef every day. 
This was under a Dutch captain. He never had vegetables of any 
kind during nine months, except sweet potatoes three or four times at 
Florence. At Florence they had cattle pease, indian meal, rice once or 
twice. Of indian meal one pint was allowed daily, and of pease three 
tablespoonfuls. Each man cooked his own pease and meal together in a 
quart cup with water. About half the time they had a very little salt. 
There was one time of about two weeks when baked corn-bread was 
substituted. Most of them had scurvy. Money was uniformly taken 
from them, with the promise that it would be returned to them when they 
left. This was not done. Those who secreted their money bought 
food surreptitiously. The men were kept in an open stockade. A few 
old shelters were obtained by the men. The hospital was built of pine 
slabs, open and cold, without stoves. There were fire-places, but no 
fires, except occasionally. During the winter watei; froze sufficiently to 
hold a man. In the hospital there were no floors ; bunks were made 
without straw or ticks. Each man had one tick or coverlid."

An epidemic of measles appeared amongst each successive levy 
Prevalence ^^ troops. This discasc was very injurious to the effi- 
of measles, cicucy of the amiy. But a part of the injury is repre- 
sented by the immediate mortality : a variety of secondary affec- 
tions — sequelae, so-called — continued the ravages begun by the 
original disease. According to Circular No. 6, " 21,676 cases and 
651 deaths were reported during the first year of the war ; 16,345 
cases and 1313 deaths during the second ; but there is reason to be- 
lieve the actual number of cases was considerably greater, since it 
is well known that the disease frequently prevailed epidemically in 
new regiments, after the men began to come together in the State 
to which they belonged, but before they were mustered into the 
service of the United States, and therefore before the medical 

officers began to report to the Surgeon-General's Office 

The direct mortality was not great, being only one death to eveiy 
twenty cases, but tedious catarrh, pneumonia, and pleuro-pneu- 
monia were frequent sequela3 ; and a part of the mortality fr^om 
these affiictions was due indirectly to measles." 

That measles was more prevalent than the returns exhibit is 
Mortality ccrtaiuly true, but that the unmediate mortality may be 
measles. exprcsscd iu tlic proportion of one death to twenty cases, 



DR. SALISBURY'S THEORY OF FUNGI. 219 

is certainly incorrect. We have carefully collected some statistics 
on this point in two large general hospitals, so placed as to receive 
a large number of cases. The mortality in the general field 
hospital at Chattanooga, Tennessee, was 22.4 to 100 cases. It 
may be objected to these results, that they occurred in a hospital 
the hygienic condition of which was unfavorable to recovery from 
measles. But this objection cannot be urged against the statistics 
of General Hospital No. 1, Nashville, which was well appointed 
in every respect. In this hospital the .mortality was 19.6 to 100 
cases, or nearly one in five. The medical reports were often 
vitiated by a false method of expressing results. Some prominent 
compHcation arising in the course of a disease was not unfrequently 
entered on the report of sick and wounded as the cause of death, 
instead of the disease itself. Thus, in cases of measles, pneumo- 
nia or bronchitis was assumed to be the cause of death, and the 
fact thus appears on the report. Until they came to learn more 
of its virulence, by many medical officers it was considered dis- 
reputable to lose a case of measles. In the two hospitals in which 
I made these observations I was at especial pains to secure correct 
returns, and hence my conviction that the degree of mortality as 
expressed in Circular No. 6 is short of the truth. 

At the State rendezvous, or during the first months of service, 
all those recruits exposed to contagion became affected, ^iabrntyof 
unless they enjoyed exemption by reason of a previous ''^*''^'"*^- 
attack. In some instances it was not possible to trace the source 
of contagion. In the absence of such information, the non-con- 
tagionists assumed that the local conditions were sufficient to de- 
velop the disease. The advocates of this view were not numerous. 
The positive facts of contagion -svere too numerous to be over- 
borne by such uncertain negative testimony as the absence of any 
ascertained source of infection. Early in the war (first part of 
1862), Dr. Salisbury of Newark, Ohio, proposed a fungus theory 
in explanation of the origin of camp measles.^ 

" At the military camp — Camp Sherman — Newark, Ohio, the mea- 
sles first appeared on December 4th, the same day that Mr. Dr.SaUs- 
Dille exposed himself to the straw dust. From November 23d Si? of 
to 30th, the weather was cool, damp, with considerable sleety ^""s^- 
rain and snow. During this time (there being between six and seven 
hundred men in camp) many of the tents were furnished with ticks, 
which were filled with straw for the men to sleep on. In the centre of 
each tent was a fire, built in a hole in the ground, from which the smoke 
was led off by an underground flue, extending to the outside of the tent. 
1 American Journal of the Medical Sciences, July, 1862. 



220 DR. SALISBURY'S THEORY OF FUNGI. 

The straw ticks were arranged around the fire, several in a tent, and each 
tick accommodated two men. On December 1st, the weather became 
colder, and snow fell to the depth of about one inch. On the 2d, which 
was quite warm, this melted and wet the soil and dampened the straw 
ticks. December 4th, the measles made their first appearance in Camp 
Sherman. The men came from different parts of the county, and no 
one knew that he had been exposed to the disease. Some had been in 
camp two weeks, and no one supposed to have that disease had visited 
the camp. Subsequent inquiries have failed to discover any one who 
brought it there, or to account for the appearance of the disease from 
contagion. On the first day (December 4th), there were eight cases, 
and within a week afler there were forty. The disease then disap- 
peared for ten or twelve days from its first appearance. Between 
the 14th and 16th, the disease again made its appearance, and within 
a few days there were between forty and fifty cases more, when the 
disease ceased altogether. These last cases, occurring so near the usual 
time at which the disease ordinarily makes its appearance after expo- 
sure, renders it probable that they were communicated from the first 

cases Bearing upon this may be mentioned the circumstance 

that, in almost every instance where our soldiers have gone into camp, 
in a short time after, the disease called camp measles has made its ap- 
pearance without any previous exposure, so far as known, to the mea- 
sles. It should also be stated that their beds have usually been straw." 

It appears from another paper, by Dr. Salisbury, published in 
the succeeding number — October — of the same journal, that 
measles had been prevailing during the previous spring and sum- 
mer in a county adjoining that in which Camp Sherman was situ- 
ated. Says Dr. S. : " About the 30th of May, 1862, measles 
made its appearance amongst the boys of the Ohio State Reform 
Institution, situated in Fairfield County, Ohio. It was intro- 
duced into the establishment by a boy who was taken in be- 
fore he had entirely recovered from the disease." It would not, 
therefore, seem difficult to account for the origin of measles at 
Camp Sherman, since this disease was prevailing in a neighboring 
county. 

To give additional force to his view^s, Dr. Salisbury attempted to 
prove, by inoculation, that the straw fungus would produce measles. 
The symptoms observed by him after inserting into a puncture in 
the arm the spores and cells of the fungi, w^ere the following: 
" Symptoms resembling a slight cold, with a little chilliness, ca- 
tarrhal symptoms and sneezing." Dr. S. remarks, in his first 
paper (July, 1862) : " It is now four weeks since the exposure, 
and no signs of measles in any of the cases inoculated." He was 



CAMP MEASLES. 221 

not fortunate, however, in procuring exemption by inoculation at 
the State Reform Institution ; for we find (October, 1862), in the 
first place, that the inoculations were not followed by those symp- 
toms which he believes to indicate " modified measles," and in the 
second place, a certain number of the boys inoculated became af- 
fected with genuine rubeola. In fact, it is quite evident that the 
epidemics of measles noted by Dr. Salisbury, behaved as the erup- 
tive fevers usually do — they did not attack all who were exposed 
to contagion, and during the prevalence of them, various anomalous 
cases were observed. It was the inoculation of some of these 
anomalous cases which deceived Dr. Salisbury. 

With a view of ascertaining how far such a cause could have 
had an agency in the production of measles, special in- obserrations 
quiry was made on this point in one hundred cases, with ^u*h reTpecT 
the following result : eighty-five had not, and only fifteen bu^^/the- 
had, slept or lain on hay or straw since enlistment. It °^^' 
appeared, fiirther, that the disease was particularly rife amongst 
the volunteer troops of East Tennessee, an agricultural region, the 
inhabitants of which must have been fi'equently exposed to the 
wheat straw fungi. • Measles prevailed equally amongst the colored 
troops of the army of the Cumberland, who, before enlistment, 
were, it may be presumed, accustomed to sleep on straw. 

The new and unnatural experiences to which recruits were sub- 
jected, induced a condition of the organism exceedingly cjrcum- 
favorable to the reception and development of a morbific dS?r^^" 
agent. The epidemics of measles occurred in the fall, I'any liaEo 
winter, and spring. The camps were damp, the air ^^^^ disease. 
poisoned, the diet insufiicient. Catarrhal affections occurred in the 
proportion of 512.10 per 1000 of mean strength, or in somewhat 
more than half the strength of the army. There was, accordingly, 
a serious disturbance in the vicarious relation between the skin and 
kidneys, and the skin and mucous surfaces, intestinal and bronchial. 
An amount of the specific poison of measles under ordinary condi- 
tions insufiicient to develop an epidemic would, in these circum- 
stances, grow into a formidable epidemic. We have here a ready 
explanation of the origin and propagation of camp measles, without 
resorting to the agency of straw fungi, whose effect, if they have 
any, must be limited to the production of " hay catarrh," or " hay 
asthma." 

The eruption was distinct in sixty-five cases ; not well marked in 
thirty-five, but the other phenomena of the disease were The eruption

appearance of the eruption, the poison being so intense as to de- 
stroy the vitality of the blood (necraamia). There was nothing 
peculiar, either as to the time of appearance or character of the 
eruption. In the colored soldiers, the difficulty in making out the 
eruption depended upon the depth of color ; in the pure negro, the 
eruption was yellowish, being somewhat lighter than the surround- 
ing integument ; in the mulatto, a dusky or yellowish brown ; in 
both, the eruption was ill-defined. The other symptoms were 
quite as characteristic in the colored as in the white troops, so that 
there was really no difficulty in making a diagnosis in any case. 
. The desquamation of the epidermis was a more distinctly marked 
Desquama- procGss in camp mcaslcs than in the epidemic measles of 
measles. civil life. Considerable patches of epidermis were some- 
times thrown off. This stage of the disease, in severe cases, was 
characterized by a remarkable increase in the gravity of the symp- 
toms. Coincidently with the desquamation, bronchitis, capillaiy 
bronchitis, lobular and lobar pneumonia, cerebral disorder, ileo- 
colitis, and congestion of the kidneys, were prominent in the 
procession of morbid phenomena. 

In the fatal cases (twenty-eight in the series of one hundred 
Delirium in cascs sclectcd for analysis), more or less violent delirium

requiring the presence of attendants to keep the patients in bed. 
These symptoms were explained by the lesions discovered on post- 
mortem examination : injection and hyperaemia of the brain sub- 
stance ; engorgement of the vessels of the choroid plexus ; fluid in 
the ventricles and in the sub-arachnoid space ; in three cases, recent 
lymph on the surface of both hemispheres ; and in one case, a 
large, soft, black coagulum overlying the upper portion of the hem- 
ispheres. 

The most important of the symptoms were those pertaining to

and affections i • t ^ mi i i • • 

pertaining to obscrvcd m Ordinary measles, capillary bronchitis, pneu- 
tory system, mouia, and pleuro-pneumonia were pronounced complica- 
tions in camp measles. In the fatal cases, these accidents were 
the usual cause of death. In the twenty-eight fatal cases, the 
following was observed to be the condition of the lungs : In all 
the lungs were much engorged, completely filling the thoracic cav- 
ity ; in all more or less bronchitis existed — in eight that condition 
to which may be applied the term capillary bronchitis ; in eight 
cases, the finer bronchial tubes being involved, a condition of ate- 
lectasis was observed in both lungs — on the anterior face of the 



SYMPTOMS OF CAMP MEASLES. 223 

lungs isolated lobules, and on the posterior face large patches of 
lung, being in this state ; in six cases double pleuro-pneumonia 
existed ; in ten cases the pneumonia and pleuro-pneumonia were 
confined to the right lung, the left lung being in the state of con- 
gestion and atelectasis already described. The capillary bronchi- 
tis and the collapse of portions of lung tissue seemed precedent to 
the development of pneumonia, for these collapsed portions of lung 
became the seat of the first development of the pneumonic consol- 
idation. The bronchial glands participated in the destructive proc- 
esses going on in the pulmonary tissue ; they enlarged, became 
soft and pulpy, and, in one instance, suppurated largely, producing 
an abscess which dissected up the loose areolar tissue posterior to 
the esophagus and ascended to the level of the os hyoides. 

Coincident with these changes in the lungs, the action of the 
heart became labored and rapid. The lips w^ere blue, symptoms 
and the anxiety of the patients extreme. These symp- the heart. 
toms had an obvious cause in the state of the heart and gi*eat ves- 
sels — the right cavity, the ascending and descending vena cava^ 
and the pulmonary artery were found after death distended with 
large coagula, and -the left cavity empty. The congestion of the 
brain already alluded to, and the congestion of the kidneys to be 
noted presently, were probably due to this obstruction in the pul- 
monary circulation, rather than to any direct action of the morbid 
agent upon these organs. The blood itself was altered ; it was 
thin and watery, and the coagula were soft, and although the 
blood appeared black there was an evident increase in the white 
corpuscles. In one fatal case purpuric spots were observed in the 
integument and in other textures. 

" The mucous membrane of the mouth and fauces w^as red and 
punctated ; the tongue bright red and loaded at the sides symptoms 
and posteriorly ; the filiform papillae prominent. There tfmoutii 
were always more or less deep injection of the soft palate, ^'^"^e^-^*^- 
swelling of the tonsils and uvula, and small, circular, whitish ulcers, 
covered with a soft exudation on the buccal and labial mucous 
membrane. The swelling of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, 
involving the orifices of the Eustachian tubes, and the considerable 
enlargement of the tonsils, were the causes of the deafiiess expe- 
rienced in a large number of cases. Deglutition was painfiil and 
difficult from these causes, and from the sometimes thickened, 
erect, and inflamed epiglottis. Vomiting was rare, but diarrhoea 
existed in two thirds of the cases." Characteristic lesions were 
found in the intestinal tract — in the ileum, caecum, and colon. 



224 SEQUELS or CAMP MEASLES. 

Early in the disease the changes consisted in a deep redness (port- 
wine color) of the ileum, — the veins of the sub-mucous coat being 
distended so that their arborescent distribution was beautifully 
shown, — distension and elevation of the solitary glands and 
greater distinctness of the follicles of Lieberkiihn, and of the tubu- 
lar glands of the large intestine, than is usual in the natural state. 
These are the phenomena observed, due especially to the action 
of the measles poison ; subsequent changes in the glandular appa- 
ratus of the intestinal tract are to be studied amongst the sequelas 
of measles. 

With respect to the kidneys, the earliest symptoms observed

the kidneys, an mcrcasc lu the specmc gravity and morbid deposits. 
In three of those severe cases in which the eruption was either 
absent or imperfectly developed, in which the respiration was 
greatly embarrassed from congestion of the lungs, and in which 
coma and convulsions announced serious lesion of the brain, there 
was total suppression of urine. The urinary deposits consisted of 
the urates, mucus, and epithelium, and sometimes blood. The 
chlorides disappeared in the cases of atelectasis as well as those 
of pneumonia, but as regards this observation there must be ex- 
pressed some doubt, since the physical signs are hardly distinctive 
enough to assume its correctness. Albumen and casts were not 
detected in a single instance. Convalescence was usually an- 
nounced by a sudden increase in the quantity of the urine — so 
sudden, indeed, in many cases, as to entitle this phenomena to be 
considered " critical." 

The kidneys, on post-mortem examination, exhibited changes ex- 
planatory of the symptoms observed during life. They were al- 
ways found in a state of hyperaemia ; the cortical substance being 
dark-brown, the pyramids deep purple, and the papillae red. By 
pressure, from the tubular orifices of the papillee could be forced 
urine of the appearance of milk — an appearance due to the quan- 
tity of epithelium contained in it. The tubules themselves, on 
microscopic examination, were seen to be crowded with epithelium 
and the debris of cells. 

Camp measles was formidable not only in consequence of the 
Sequelae of immediate mortality but also by reason of secondary dis- 
m^sies. eases, the product of changes induced in organs by the 
measles poison. 

The sequelae were of two classes : — 

1st. Those in which the diseases of organs continued, after the 



TWO METHODS OF TREATMENT. 225 

phenomena proper to rubeola had disappeared, without an inter- 
vening stage of convalescence : the typhoid state, bronchitis, pneu- 
monia. 

2d. Those which supervened after an apparent or incomplete 
convalescent stage : chronic pneumonia, phthisis, chronic dysen- 
tery. 

The typhoid state was a close approximation to typhoid fever. 
The enlargement and elevation of the . solitary glands Typj^^id 
characteristic of the disease became more evident in the ^Mtis anT' 
typhoid state, and the agminated patches, also, thickened. p°<^"™o^'* 
There was, however, no corresponding alteration of the mesen- 
teric glands, neither did the characteristic ulceration of the patches 
take place. The usual objective symptoms — low delirium, sub- 
sultus, diarrhoea, sordes, dry tongue, etc. — were well marked. 
The bronchitis and pneumonia continued after the disappearance 
of the other symptoms, and were the immediate cause of death in 
many cases. The pneumonia was the direct result of changes in 
those portions of the pulmonary tissue in the state of atelectasis. 

After a period of convalescence, which was imperfect and unsat- 
isfactory, the sequelae proper began to manifest them- chronic pneu- 

. -^^ , . ^ -11 nil moniaand 

selves. Chronic pneumonia has been alluded to as one diarrhoea, 
of these secondary affections. It may be well questioned whether 
this term is, in strict propriety, applicable to those changes Avhich 
slowly but progressively ensue in the collapsed lobules. They be- 
come camified ; deposits take place in the connective tissue between 
the air-sacs, and the neighboring portions of lung tissue become the 
seat of a passive congestion. It is very probable — although upon 
this point I do not possess any positive facts — that the so-called 
acute tuberculosis, which so frequently followed measles, consisted 
of nothing more than the deposition of a plastic material in the 
carnified portions of the lung. 

A chronic ileo-colitis (army diarrhoea) was a very common sec- 
ondary trouble. This was nothing more than a legitimate effect 
of those changes in the glandular apparatus of the small and large 
intestines, which, we have seen, were produced by the measles 
poison. 

During the war, two methods of treatment were followed : the 
antiphlogistic remedies and regimen, and the stimulant. Two methods 
The results were not satisfactory by either of these men'^'" 
methods. Many cases, if left to themselves, terminated favorably 
by the unassisted efforts of nature. An increase in the amount of 
the urinary secretion, a diarrhoea, or a sudden diaphoresis, were

phenomena marking the crisis and decline of the disease. The 
true therapeutics consisted in producing or favoring the occurrence 
of these critical discharges when the proper period of their appear- 
ance arrived. 

Congestions of organs, the proper performance of whose func- 
A rational tious was csscutial to life, occurring suddenly, and due of 
treatment coursc to somc scrious Icsiou of the blood not cognizable 
by our present means of investigation, were the sources of danger. 
The effort to relieve these congestions by general bleeding, proved 
fatal in every case in which it was employed under my observation. 
The use of antimonials and mercurials was either prejudicial or of 
non-effect. The stimulant method was not more successfiil. After 
a careful study of the morbid anatomy, I ventured to propose a 
rational method of treatment. To relieve the congestion of the 
brain and lungs, and the overloaded right cavity and great venous 
trunks, I proposed ligatures, applied alternately to the thighs, to 
remove from the general circulation so much of the venous blood 
as could be thus with safety retained in the limb ; counter irrita- 
tion, by saline cathartics and hot pediluvia, and by cups to the neck 
when the brain was the organ to be relieved, and by sinapisms and 
cups to the thorax, when the lungs were involved ; under all cir- 
cumstances the activity of the kidneys was to be promoted by 
saline diuretics, congestion of these organs to be relieved by cups 
and sinapisms to the lumbar region, and the functions of the skin 
to be maintained by suitable diaphoretics, and during the stage of 
desquamation by inunctions of oil. Circumstances prevented the 
trial of this method of treatment in a large number of cases, but 
in the few cases in which it was followed the results were in every 
way confirmatory of its usefulness. At least, no case thus treated 
died — a negative result, truly, but of value as indicating the pos- 
sibility of greater success than by the other methods of treatment 
pursued during the war. 

TESTIMONY OF MEDICAL OFFICERS RESPECTING THE PREVALENCE, 
FATALITY, ETC., OF CAMP MEASLES. 

Numerous correspondents bear testimony to the extensive preva- 
lence of measles among newly-recruited troops, especially from the 
country; to a considerable fatality resulting from this disease, 
especially in the winter months, or when cases are treated in 
crowded hospitals, and when the disease is associated with the effects 
of malaria or scurvy ; also, to the fact that a large number of 
those who do not fall victims to the disease or its sequels, are in-

capacitated by it for remaining in the service. Enougli of this 
testimony will be subjoined to show that measles is truly one of the 
most formidable of camp diseases. In respect of its importance 
as a disease of the camp, it offers a striking contrast to its occur- 
rence among young subjects in civil life. 

The means of securing for armies protection against the losses 
by death and dischar£!;e from the prcA^alence of this dis- Means of

hitherto received. Aside from higher considerations discharge 
than those relating to military policy, it is very desirable disease. 
to adopt measures to diminish the fatality from the disease, and 
lessen its disqualifying effects with reference to the efficiency of 
armies. The value of a soldier, in a military point of view, is not 
a little enhanced by his having had this disease, and either escaped 
or recovered from its sequels. Measures which suggest themselves 
are — 1st. Providing for the exposure to the disease of those 
recruits who have not experienced it, at a favorable season, and 
for the management of cases under the most favorable hygienic con- 
ditions ; and 2d. If this measure be not practicable, isolating cases 
promptly whenever they occur, so as to prevent exposure to the 
infectious miasm. 

The Circular issued by the Medical Committee contained the 
following question : " Have you observed aught peculiar to measles 
in camps, as regards production, cHnical history, or complications ? " 
The communications elicited by the Circular contained no facts nor 
statements tending to show that measles in camps differs in any 
essential particulars from the disease as presented in civil life. 
The larger death-rate, the greater liability to serious or tedious 
sequels, and the debilitated condition of the system, which is apt to 
follow, are attributable to the various depressing influences incident 
to camps, to the coexistence of the scorbutic condition in some 
cases ; and, in certain situations, the disease attacks those who are 
suffering from malarial poisoning. It is to be added, that nothing 
has been communicated in support of the theory advanced by 
Professor Salisbury, of Cleveland, Ohio, which refers the origin of 
the disease to the spores of a peculiar vegetable fungus generated 
in straw under the influence of heat and moisture. One of the 
correspondents of the Commission, however, Dr. Benjamin Wood- 
ward, as will presently be seen, has observed an eruption resem- 
bling somewhat that of measles, which he attributes to the source 
just stated. 

The subjoined extracts from a number of the communications

whicli the Committee have received, will enable the reader to form 
an idea of the extent to which measles prevailed, the formidable 
character of the disease, etc : — 

" Measles have prevailed to a very great extent. When regiments, 
Surgeon raised in rural districts, first come into the service, at least 
moay^ ^ ' seventy-fivc per cent, have measles. The sequelae have dis- 
abled many. Regiments from large towns and cities have not suffered

charged from service on account of sequences of the disease." ^

"Measles was largely prevalent during the first two months. Some

" T have seen scores suffer, and many die, from the effects of measles

" Soon afler our troops were mustered into the service, in 1861, at 
Surgeon least ouc half of them were rendered ineffective, either from 
testimony, mcasles or its sequeliE. Taking into account its immediate 
effects and its sequelae, measles is assuredly the worst disease I ever saw 
in camp. More soldiers died, and were discharged, from it and its 
sequelae, than from any other disease, during the first twelve months. 
Perhaps it would not be saying too much to say that, during this period, 
more died and were discharged from this than all other diseases. The 
most severe and fatal sequelae were bronchitis, pneumonia, and typhoid 
fever. No soldier should be put on duty at night or in bad weather, 
until he has fully recovered." ^

measles in camp with the simplest remedies, allowing the patient to oc-

satisfactory result. As a rule, I excused soldiers from duty for from 
three to four weeks after convalescence from measles. Whenever prac- 
ticable, I would advise that the soldier be left in camp and not removed 
to hospital when attacked with this disease. Those who have been 
treated in camp, have usually recovered entirely within six to eight 
weeks after attack." ^ 

" In every camp and hospital under my charge, I have had cases of 
measles. At the first encampment of the Massachusetts 25th surgeon 
regiment, at Annapolis, Md., November, 1861, measles went f^^^yl 
through the entire regim.ent, in most cases leaving the pa- testimony,

and spring of 1863, I had charge of the garrison at Plymouth, N. C, 
at that time garrisoned mostly by North Carolina troops. Measles pre- 
vailed very generally both among the troops and the inhabitants of the 
town. Very few cases proved fatal, nor were they followed by other 
diseases. During the winters of 1863, 1864, and 1865, on Long and 
Gallop's Islands, measles prevailed very generally, most cases resulting 
favorably." -^ 

" Of the six hundred recruits received after I joined the regiment, 
Assistant- about onc hundred were attacked with measles the succeeding 
whftteker's winter ; some of these, according to their own account, had 
testimony, j^^d the discasc before. It is a great pest. To have measles 
in a regiment is worse than a heavy battle. Even under favorable cir- 
cumstances the sequelae of measles are to be dreaded, and they are for- 
midable in camp. If there be any latent tendency to phthisis, it is very 
apt to be developed. In some dysenteric symptoms are consequent, or a 
protracted and wasting diarrhoea; and some remain in a debilitated 
condition for months or years, not sick enough to remain in hospital* 
but not well enough to go on duty ; subject to pulmonic symptoms from 
every slight exposure, or to frequent attacks of diarrhoea. The post 
hospital at Corinth, Miss., was so crowded, that we were obliged to 
receive patients with measles, from regiments stationed on the outposts, 
into our regimental hospital ; among these were a number of Alabamians 
belonging to our army, who, from some constitutional peculiarity, ap- 
peared to suffer worse effects from the disease than our own men ; and 
among them it was less likely to terminate favorably, although they 
received the same care, and had as good treatment. 

" Moreover, when measles becomes prevalent, it is difficult to keep 
cases out of the wards appropriated to other diseases ; and if a patient 
in the advanced stage of some disease gets measles, there is not much 
hope for him." ^

occurring in the spring or summer, it runs its course without ill ef-

general health of the patient is feeble long after convalescence. Lung 
affections more particularly follow in the train of this disease when con- 
tracted in cold weather." ^

immediately succumb, were not less marked in the Southern armies 
than in those of the United States. To this fact, Professor Paul

proved so fatal in camp, that companies, battalions, and whole regiments 
had to be disbanded for a time, and the men sent home. This disease, 
so simple in childhood and so successfully, managed in domestic life, 
often becomes quite the reverse to this from exposure and the hardships 
in camp. This is no new feature in the history of measles. Being a 
self-limited affection, it must run its course, and the province of the 
physician is to watch the operations of Nature and to prevent complica- 
tions and the development of unpleasant symptoms. It is, moreover, 
an infantile malady, and the camp is truly no place for puerile com- 
plaints. The common-sense view, then, of the subject, is to place the 
patient, wherever practicable, under the circumstances most favorable 
to his recovery when .attacked with measles, and this undoubtedly is 
under the parental roof. 

" Measles, during the organization of regiments, and then bowel affec- 
tions, diarrhoea especially, were the diseases of the late Southern army. 
Those advanced somewhat in years, will recollect how our troops suf- 
fered from this latter affection in the Mexican "War. Many even of 
those who returned home lingered for months with chronic diarrhoea, 
the soldier's bane in hot climates, and found relief at last only in the 
grave." 

The following paper, communicated by Dr. Benjamin Woodward, 
Surgeon 22d Infantry, Illinois Volunteers, is entitled : communica- 
"Notes on Measles, as seen at Bird's-Point and New geonBenja- 
Madrid, Mo., in the autumn, winter, and spring of 1861- ward.

pital, Louisville, Ky., in the autumn and winter of 1862, and at 
the General Hospital, Tullahoma, Tenn., in March, 1864." 

" Among the troops coming fresh from home to Cairo and Bird's- 
Point in the autumn of 1861, measles was epidemic. If the men 
were attacked soon after coming into camp, and before they had 
been subjected to the malaria of the region, the disease had all the 
characteristics manifested in civil life, and could not be distinguished 
from cases among adults at home ; and it is therefore to the pecu- 
liarities of the disease in the army that I shall refer. Cairo, 111., 
Bird's-Point, Mo., Fort Hoik, Ky., and the whole vicinage of that 
region, is one immense swamp, receiving the drainage of lUinois,

malarious influences so constantly at work. Every form of disease 
is complicated by malaria, and rapidly takes on asthenic character- 
istics, rendering those subjected to any infectious or contagious dis- 
ease sure to acquire it, and rendering their systems incapable 
of resisting or rallying from its depressing influences. In no 
form of disease was this more manifest than in the epidemic of 
measles which, in the fall of 1861 and the winter following, nearly 
decimated the regiments quartered in that region, and never was 
the infectious nature of a disease more strongly marked. From 
the exigencies of the service, and the crowded condition of all the 
hospitals, it was not possible to separate eruptive diseases from 
others — they were indiscriminately mixed in the fatal wards. The 
initiatory fever and rigor were, in nearly every case, like ague ; 
and, indeed, the most of the men either had, or had had, ague. In 
those cases occurring in men fresh from their country homes, the 
coryza and tumefaction of the eyelids, together with the fever, 
were diagnostic of the disease ; and when the eruption appeared, 
it was of a bright good color, having the true crescentic form, 
and if there were no complication the disease ran its course kindly : 
but when the patient had been subjected to the depression of ma- 
laria the pulse was rapid, feeble, and soft, the tongue dry, the skin 
of a dusky, livid color, and the eruption, instead of being bright 
and clear, was dark-livid, having more the appearance of diffused 
ecchymosis than any thing else, and, instead of the distinct cres- 
centic form, ran together in large dark patches. In these cases 
there was nearly always inflammation of the mucous surface of the 
nose and throat, which often degenerated into ulceration and de- 
struction of the soft parts, and the whole conchtion became typhoid. 
Pneumonia was developed in a large number of cases, and I think 
it safe to say, it always was typhoid in its character. Diarrhoea 
and dysentery had been prevalent all the season to such an extent 
that hardly a man escaped. There were thus complications to 
contend with which taxed the skill and perseverance of the med- 
ical oflicers to the utmost. In the worst class of cases the pulse 
often ran as high as 140 to 150 per minute, very feeble and soft ; the 
tongue became dry and dark brown, with the edges and tip fiery 
red ; the skin was cold and clammy ; the eyes red with continual 
weeping ; the urine scanty and ammoniacal. If blood was drawn 
and examined with the microscope, the white cells were in great 
proportion, as in leucocytosis. I am not aware whether this con- 
dition of the blood in measles has ever been pointed out, but so far 
as my own examinations have extended, it always obtains, when 



COMMUNICATION BY SURGEON WOODWARD. 233 

the disease lias assumed a malignant character. In those cases in 
which pneumonia supervened, this last was always of a low or 
typhoid character, indicating an eminently tonic and sustaining 
treatment. In many cases, while the desquamative process was 
going on, and even after its completion, we had the same tendency 
to dropsy that is found so prevalent after scarlatina, and the urine 
was albuminous. None of these last cases recovered, so far as I 
know. I was enabled to make but one autopsy of such a case, 
and in that there was marked congestion, of the kidneys, and they 
had a waxy consistence and appearance. In this case the liver was 
mottled, and the lungs had the well-known appearance of typhoid 
pneumonia. One very remarkable fact was, that in every case 
where the patients lay on straw that was not perfectly sweet and 
fresh, the eruption assumed a livid, unhealthy hue with extreme 
irritation of the surface, and in many cases became pustular ; this 
condition I will refer to in the after-part of this paper. These 
have been the marked characteristics of the disease in all the local- 
ities I have mentioned where the patients have been crowded in 
hospitals. It can hardly be profitable for me to speak of modes 
of treatment, for it is evident that, from the general character of the 
disease, it could but be eminently tonic and antiseptic. In the con- 
gested condition of the lungs which often obtained in the pneumo- 
nia, blisters were used in some cases, but always with a bad effect, 
for the vitality was so low that sloughing of the surface often took 
place, and their depressing influence was marked in all. Warm 
stupes were found far more advantageous, and had a soothing 
influence on the patients. I have referred to the influence of the 
straw on which the patients lay ; it has often occurred to me to 
find cases of an eruption so simulating measles, that but for the 
absence of the fever and other diagnostic marks, it might readily 
be taken for that disease when the men had lain on old musty 
straw. 

" My attention was first called to this while General Pope's army 
was operating at Island No. 10, and New Madrid. The men found 
some old straw stacks which they appropriated for bedding, and 
very soon we had a large number of so-called measles, but wliich, 
on a critical examination, were found to be only a cutaneous dis- 
ease. After long and patient search I traced it to the straw, which 
was found to be covered with a fungus which I believe to be Puc- 
cinia graminis. I was led to this view from the well-known fact 
among farmers, that hogs and cattle lying in old straw, especially 



234 COiMMUNlCATION OF DR. S. L. ADAMS. 

that of buckwheat, are attacked with a cutaneous disease which 
keeps them continually scratching ; and I found that when the men 
no longer lay on this mouldy straw, the eruption disappeared. So 
in genuine measles, when the straw of their beds was at all mil- 
dewed, the eruption took on an unhealthy character. This may 
seem out of place, but I always find eruptive diseases aggravated 
by impure bedding. 

" We are at this time having a few cases of measles at this hospi- 
tal (TuUahoma, Tenn.), among new recruits just from the North ; 
but, so far, there is nothing remarkable in their cases. So far as 
my own experience goes, it is of the utmost importance to isolate 
cases of measles from all others as much as possible, but where this 
cannot be done, it will be found that the vapor of bromine kept 
diffused in the wards will act as a prophylactic, and few, if any, 
new cases will originate." 

The following is communicated by Dr. Samuel L. Adams, late 
Surgeon U. S. Army and Navy : — 

" Rubeola was a terrible scourge to the Kentucky troops in the 
communica- beginning of the war. Of those who had been reared in 
geTn^samuei ^^^^ rural districts, many had never had the disease, and 
L. Adams. ^YiQ greater part of these contracted it. In two companies 
of our regiment we had fifty cases in January, 1862. I had seen 
this disease at Camp Dick Robinson in the previous autumn ; and 
an order had been issued that, as soon as any cases appeared in our 
camp, the patients should be sent to the general hospital. Nine 
patients were sent to the hospital in accordance with this order. 
On going to the hospital, with two additional cases, after four or 
five days, I found five of the nine patients had died, and two more 
were moribund. Believing that I could do better for my men in 
my field hospital, I obtained leave to bring back my two cases, 
and to retain all that might subsequently occp-r. Of the cases 
treated in the field hospital, I lost but two, and in these two cases 
death took place, after a protracted illness, from tuberculous disease. 
I refer to these facts in explanation of the preference which I have 
for treating: cases of this disease in the field rather than in the 
crowded wards of an in-door hospital. Fresh air seemed necessary 
to the successful management of the cases. The disease passed 
through its course without presenting any peculiarities, but what 
was called typhoid pneumonia was apt to follow. The treatment 
pursued was as follows : I required my patients to drink fi^eely 
of cold water, to keep themselves well covered in bed, but to

have plenty of fresh air. As soon as the eruption appeared, 
quinia and whisky were given freely, and continued until recovery 
took place. This treatment seemed to aggravate the febrile con- 
dition for a day or two, but I think it prevented the occurrence 
of pneumonia or typhoid symptoms. No expectorants were used."

the " yellow fever zone." With like assurance it was asserted 
that from the James and the Savannah to the Mississippi and the 
Gulf, unacclimated soldiers would quickly be disabled by the per- 
nicious malarial fevers that prevailed over more than half the 
region, and for nearly half the year, south of the Ohio. 

Medical men who had not learned the prophylactic power of 
hygienic measures against the yellow fever, and of qui- Assurances 
nine against the paludal malaria, mentally admitted, and protection. 
sometimes openly said, that these forebodings of evil to our armies 
would probably prove too true. But patriotism and the war 
spirit heeded no dangers ; and, fortunately, there are some cer- 
tainties in medicine and hygiene which seldom disappoint the 
physician who puts his trust in a judicious and timely application 
of the agencies and the principles upon which such certahities are 
founded. The records, both of yellow fever and of all the mala- 
rial fevers, in the armies during the late war, have demonstrated 
more conclusively than ever witnessed before, that the doctrines 
of hygiene can be trusted to work out all they promise for the 
protection of cities, navies, and armies. 

In April, 1862, when the naval forces under Commodore Far- 
ragut (now Admiral) braved the fires of Fort St. Philip and of 
the threatening fleet that vainly forbade approach to New Orleans, 
such valor might have opened the highway to pestilence capture of 
and the grave when the national standard was restored to did not open 
the metropolis of the Gulf States, had not the general yeiiow^feTer'!' 
commanding that expedition carried with him the baton and 
broom of sanitary reform. On the 1st of May, 1862, Major- 
General Butler promulgated his first general order, announcing 
the pohcy he determined to pursue in the control of municipal 
affiiirs in New Orleans ; and in a single paragraph it was explicitly 
made known to the inhabitants that all sanitary laws and regula- 
tions would be rigidly and promptly enforced. A pro- Sanitary-

Visional city government having been organized, its new Orleans, 
police force, under military regulations, devoted its chief attention 
to the duties imposed by the sanitary regulations for the city. 

The efficient health government that had been so promptly in- 
augurated by General Butler continued in full force until the end 
of the war. During the year 1862, New Orleans and the entire 
Federal fleet remained free from yellow fever. The military 
forces saw much hard service ; the transports in which The troops 
they came were both unclean and unhealthy; then- ^onTSke 
camps and quarters were insalubrious ; and during the ^'^^^""^ ^^''^'■•

Favorable lo- Tlic quarantine station was maintained at the usual point, 
New oriLns. hctwecn sixty and seventy miles down the river ; but, in 
Quarantine, ^j^^ abscuce of trade with the permanent habitats of the 
yellow fever in the West India Islands, the quarantine officers had 
light service, and the city was measurably secure against imported 
infection. Best of all, its sanitary police had rendered it secure 
against its own domestic sources of the scourge. In subsequent 
pages we will examine this lesson of experience in regard to the 
yellow fever at New Orleans and on the Mississippi River. 

The war being at an end, and the records of experience in 
towns exposed to yellow fever in the insurgent States being now 
freely accessible, we here propose to recall the facts concerning this 
fever in those towns during the year 1862. This is essential to a 
correct understanding of the history of yellow fever as it pre- 
vailed, and as it was prevented from prevailing, during the war. 
We quote such information as we have received by correspondence, 
and as we find well authenticated in published records in the South 
during the progress of events to which they relate.

ported in July, and on the 4th and 5th of August two fatal and 
confirmed cases of the fever occurred in another filthy quarter. 
Dr. Wm. T. Wragg, a distinguished student of yellow fever, re- 
ported, as the result of correspondence and inquiry, that the epi- 
demic in Wilmington continued to increase after the 1st of July, 
and that the acme of its ravages was reached in the third week of 
October, when four hundred and twenty-one cases and one hun- 
statistics of dred and two deaths occurred. The " Wilmington Jour-

UNHYGIENIC CONDITION OF THE CITY. 239 

Dr. Wragg states that, at the period here mentioned, the popu- 
lation of Wilmington was about five thousand, and that there was 
one case of fever out of less than four inhabitants, and one death 
to every eleven of the inhabitants that remained alive ; and he 
adds the remark, that of the population of Wilmington at that time, 
at least one half were negroes, who suffered much less than the 
white inhabitants of the place. Hence it would appear, conclu- 
sively, that more than half of all the white population was attacked 
by the fever, and that at least one out 6f every five white inhabi- 
tants was killed by it. 

It will ever remain a vexed question whether that epidemic was 
wholly of spontaneous origin, or had its inception from imported 
germs by the blockade runners. We quote the following facts 
relating to this point, premising that there seems to be scarcely a 
doubt that the epidemic had obtained foothold in that horribly 
filthy city prior to the 4th of August : On the afternoon of 
August 6th, the steamer Kate^ a noted blockade runner. Arrival of 
arrived from Nassau, which port she left on the 2d of t^^-^*^'*- 
August. Yellow fever was epidemic there at the time of depart- 
ure ; and so intensely infected was the atmosphere in that port that 
the steamer Kersonese and other vessels became thoroughly infected at 
infected by it while lying at the wharf or at anchor. It Prov. 
was proved that the Kates firemen and crew contracted the dis- 
ease while in the port of Nassau ; the fact also appears that the 
infection continued to strike down officers and men connected with 
that vessel more than two weeks subsequent to arrival at Wil- 
mington. We give these facts for what they are worth ; and, 
from the events that preceded the arrival of the Kate, there was 
good reason for the opinion of Dr. Wragg, that this epidemic had 
a spontaneous origin. The following passages from his p^. ^,agg'a 
report show what kind of local causes prevailed in con- ^^^^^ 
nection with the outbreak of the epidemic : — 

"During July, August, and September, the entire country was 
deluged with rain. Ponds formed on high and dry places where water 
was never known to accumulate before, and, owing to neglect of the 
culverts, especially on Front Street, near Koberts' Foundry, a large, 
long, shallow pond was formed, the bottom of which was unhygienic

shoes, rags, pieces of tin, and refuse matter of all descriptions, which 
had been thrown in by the town carts in order to raise the valley to a 
level with the adjoining streets. This spot is known by the name of 
the Rouse Lot. The bottom of this pond was alternately dry from

evaporation and exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and then again 
filled by fresh rains, when it was covered by green slime, and exhaled 
a most offensive odor. One square south of this pond, in the direction 
of the prevailing winds, the first cases commenced." 

According to the statements of Dr. Anderson and Dr. Wragg, 
there v^^ere well-marked cases of yellovv^ fever in several of the 
filthy quarters of Wilmington previous to the arrival of the steam- 
The Kate ^hip Kate. But'it is knovrn that the Kate had yellow 
was infected, fey^.j. j^ her ship's company, and that immediately afler 
the arrival of that vessel the fever became epidemic and alarm- 
ingly fatal ; yet it does not appear certain that any of the new 
centres of the infection were derived from the infected blockade run- 
ner. The chief point of general interest to the medical profession 
in reference to the Wilmington epidemic, aside from its terrible 
Facts reiat- fatality, is that which relates to the question of the indig- 
ing to origin. gjjQ^g Origin of the infection. Though it is barely pos- 
sible that yellow fever has sometimes originated solely from local 
causes at points as far north as the ports of North Carolina, we 
regard the evidence relating to the Wilmington epidemic in 1862 
as being very strongly in favor of its exotic origin. One of the 
most significant facts bearing upon this question is that which ap- 
pears in the records of the disease in that city of filth concerning the 
wide distribution of the infection in different quarters of the place. 
This fact was observed within five days from the date of the 
Sporadic Kate^s arrival. Now, had that ship been the chief or 
cases. ^j^jy. fop^j. Qf ^q pestilcncc, such a dispersion of the in- 

fection would scarcely have been possible, except by dispersion of 
her cargo and clothing. To what extent this actually occurred 
we cannot now ascertain. 

The infected ship, here mentioned, arrived the 6th of August. 
Up to September 10th, there had been only eight cases 
and six deaths among citizens and soldiers. The culmi- 
nating point in the epidemic was attained in a little less than five 
weeks after that date. We here close this brief record of yellow 
fever in Wilmington, — the chief of depots for the blockade run- 
ners, — simply remarking that the pernicious malarial fever, which 
is the indigenous product of the paludal banks of the Cape Fear 
River, on which that city is situated, may have been mistaken for 
the yellow fever in the early cases that now stand charged to the 
epidemic, and that other and earlier blockade runners than the Kate 
may have conveyed the infection thither from Nassau or Havana. 

Matagorda^ Texas. — There was a fatal outbreak of yellow fever 



YELLOW FEVER ON TFIE DRY TORTUGAS. 241 

at Matagorda, Texas, during the autumn of 1862. It was attrib- 
uted to an infected blockade runner. Out of a popula- Remarkable 
tion of five hundred persons, one hundred and twenty died, f^^'^^^^y 
and about two himdred and fifty, or half the inhabitants of the 
place, suffered from the fever. Mobile reported the existence of 
the fever from imported sources ; but only in the little towns of 
Wilmington, N. C, and Matagorda, Texas, within the entire 
coast-line of blockaded ports, did this -scourge of the American 
and African tropics inflict much injury during the year 1862. • 

Yellow Fever at Key Wed and the Dry Tortugas. — Upon these 
two isolated and salubrious sand keys, the infection of yellow fever 
had never found a congenial soil until they were crowded by sol- 
diers, and almost daily exposed to perils of intercourse with the 
Gulf Squadron, and to constant intercommunication with the 
infected West Indian ports. Early in the autumn of "1862, the 
infection obtained foothold, and began its fatal ravages among the 
regiments there. The fact that the port of Key West became 
intensely infected, is shown by the circumstances attending the 
transportation of the yellow fever infection from that port, by a 
great number of vessels that merely called there. The case of 
the gunboat TaJioma illustrates this fact. That vessel The gunboat 
called at Key West to leave a large cannon, and tarried mi864. 
only while transferring it from ship to shore. In July, about a 
month subsequently, while in the northern latitudes, yellow fever 
became epidemic on board of that vessel ; yet, her only exposure 
to an infected atmosphere was that brief detention at Key West. 

The Dry Tortugas, crowded with an unhappy population of prison- 
ers of war, and visited every few days by gunboats directly outbreak on 
from the harbor of Havana and the infected shores of Key tugas.^^ 
West, invited the ravages of yellow fever, the germs of which had 
been borne from the infected places just mentioned. Salubrious as 
these sand keys — now for the first time populous, and for the first 
time smitten with yellow fever ^ — had been reputed to be, it would 
appear from the records of their sanitary condition, and from the 
unexampled massing of men there, that the requisite conditions for 
a yellow fever epidemic were present ; and so far as temperature 
and humidity are concerned, those natural factors of an epidemic 
atmosphere may be said to be present there almost every year. 
But the fact to which we would call attention more especially is

242 EPIDEMIC AT HILTON HEAD. 

this, namely, that in the tents and mihtary quarters, in the prison 
LocaUzing gangs, and in the mihtary hospitals there, there existed 
causes. artificial and personal conditions of insalubrity that gave 

vehemence to the epidemic ravages of the fever poison. Even on 
board the Tahoma, where there were tAventy-six cases of yellow 
fever in seven weeks in a northern climate, and on board the trans- 
port steamship Delaivare^ in which a large number of cases of yel- 
low fever occurred in September, on the passage from Hilton Head 
to New York, abundant evidence was ftirnished that the initial and 
all-essential fact in the etiology and geography of yellow fever, is 
that which relates to the implantation of the epidemic germs or 
\hQ fomites^ in a locality where temperature, humidity, and personal 
conditions favor their pestilential propagation. 

Yellow fever prevailed at Key West in 1862, 1863, 1864, and its 
Key West port bccamc the point cCappui of the fever infection to 
as poTn^s^"' Kiany gunboats and other vessels. Nassau, on the island of

tion. jj^ July, 1862 ; and fi'om its important relations to the 

blockade running in Southern ports, we find a well-sustained med- 
ical opinion at Savannah and Wilmington, that it served as the 
chief focus of infection to those cities. And the manner in which 
the epidemic first reached Nassau is worthy of note in this place. 
It was, briefly, thus : The ship Flying Cloud came into Nassau 
directly from Havana, and discharged her cargo there ; while the 
British steamship Kersonese came alongside to leeward of her ; 
yellow fever was prevailing on board the Flying Cloud at the time ; 
but the Kersonese left immediately on a northern trip, and several 
of her crew died of black vomit before reaching the Bermudas. 
The fevers, meantime, gained foothold on land at Nassau, and for 
the first time in its history prevailed epidemically there. ^

infected place. Though there was some sickness on board during 
the trip, it does not appear to be certain that there was any case

Epidemic at Wilmington, N. C., in the Autumn of 1862. 



A SERIES OF CASES IN HOSPITAL. 243 

of yellow fever prior to her arrival at Hilton Head, August 26tli ; 
but soon after arrival, there were three fatal cases of yellow fever 
on board. After undergoing some sort of quarantine, she came 
alongside the long wharf and discharged a quantity of comestothe 
tents which she had brought up from the infected station ^schLges a 
at which she had called when on her trip. Several per- Sfrom^ 
sons sick with yellow fever were taken from her and ^^y^e^*- 
placed in the hospital, and she then proceeded northward to New 
York, having on board, when she was quarantined off Staten Isl- 
and, four men freshly attacked by the pestilence, and the corpse of 
one who had died of it on the passage. Ten cases of the fever 
occurred subsequently while the vessel was in quarantine during 
the last of September. The writer investigated the history of this 
outbreak of fever on the Delaware^ immediately after the events 
occurred, and came to the conclusion that the vessel had become 
infected while at Key West, and that the planting of the infection 
at Hilton Head occurred, naturally, as a result of the un- ^he mancCT 
shipping of the tents, etc., from the infected quarter of cl«°™^e°'' 
the vessel. And, in addition to this, the ship lay along- ^"^''''"o'^- 
side the wharf an entire day, unloading, and was but a few yards 
from the quarters of the officers and men. 

The sick were sent directly to the hospital at Hilton Head, and 
during the months of September, October, and November, thirty- 
seven persons were admitted at that hospital with yellow fever, of 
whom twenty-one died. The whole number of such admissions 
during the month of September, was eleven, during the month of 
October, nineteen, and in November there were seven. The acme 
of the epidemic seems to have been reached on the lOtli of October, 
when ten were admitted to the hospital, besides a large number 
were placed under medical care in quarters ; but the greatest fatal- 
ity occurred in the twelve cases that were admitted prior to Octo- 
ber 10th, for of those only two survived. An intelligent medical 
officer has well described the character of the fever as it appeared 
among detailed men in the quartermaster's department, commenc- 
ing with a series of cases that began October 9th. After a series of 
describing a walking case that was admitted on this date, ho'Stai- 
and who died on the 10th, the reporter goes on to state : — ^ 

" On the same morning, shortly after his death, another man walked 
into the hospital. 1 met him on the corridor and thought he had come 
in on some business. He also was from the quartermaster's depart- 
ment. He was admitted into one of the wards under my care. He had

244 ORIGIN AND LOCALIZING CAUSES. 

scarcely any fever, and seemed rather to be weary than sick, but he 
gradually grew worse, delirium and black vomit came on, and notwith- 
standing all our efforts, he died forty-eight hours after he had walked 
into the hospital. 

" The occurrence of two decided and strongly-marked cases of yellow 
fever, in men of the quartermaster's department, both of whom had 
been at work in the same neighborhood near General Mitchell's head- 
quarters, impressed us with the unwelcome fact that there was a centre 
of infection near the place, and that whether it had sprung up from the 
remnants of the disease left by the Delaware or not, or whether it was 
of spontaneous production, it had now become naturalized amongst us. 
This impression amounted to a certainty when, soon afterwards, six 
more cases were presented for admission, all engaged in the same em- 
ployment and from the same locality. 

"From the 10th to the 22d of October, there were no new applica- 
tions for the admission of yellow fever cases into the hospital, and we 
began again to hope that the disease was extinct. But in this we were 
again disappointed, for from the latter date to the end of the month 
there was almost daily a succession of new cases. During the last week 
in October we also heard of a considerable number of cases which did 
not enter the hospital. It was during this week that the lamented Gen- 
eral Mitchell, who had, without doubt, contracted the disease at Hilton 
Head, went up to Beaufort to die. 

" After the 1st of November the number of cases gradually dimin- 
Deciine of ished, and after the 10th they ceased altogether ; the weather, 
demic. from about October 25th, having become much cooler. The 

character of the cases, however, in November, was not less severe than 
of those previously admitted ; on the contrary, some of the most malig- 
nant cases occurred during that period. By some authors it has been 
stated that toward the close of epidemic yellow fever the cases become 
much milder. This does not correspond with our experience, as some 
of the last of our cases were amongst the worst. 

" Throughout the yellow fever districts of the South, the appearance 
of the first frosts is looked for with great anxiety, as there is an absolute 
certainty that it will bring the disease to a close for that season. Our 
experience here affords a clear proof of the correctness of that observa- 
tion. The first frosts took place on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of November." 

This outbreak of yellow fever at Hilton Head in 1862 is ftill of 
instruction in regard to the unhygienic conditions that favored the 
Origin and propagation of its infectious poison ; and Ave have reason 
ca*itses'.° to couclude that had the physical laws which governed 
the propagation of this pestilence been thoroughly understood and 
officially regarded, the epidemic would have been avoided. The 
doss of Major-General O. M. Mitchell, the distinguished astronomer 



GENERAL MITCHELL AND HIS STAFF. 245 

and patriot, gave to that epidemic a lamentable importance never 
to be forgotten. The fact that yellow fever was known to be 
prevailing very fatally at Key West and in the West Indian ports, 
was a warning not to be disregarded. Yet, after various orders 
concerning the ship and the quartermaster's goods (tents) on 
board, the Delaware came up to the wharf adjacent to TheDeZa- 
Major-General Mitchell's head-quarters, and there dis- tXJ'Xrf 
charged the tents. The ship remained twelve hours at charges 
the wharf; the tents were deposited m a store-house ^"mKey' 
near by head-quarters ; and, in view of the fact that but ^^^^*" 
few of the ship's company had been attacked by the fever, and 
that the ship proceeded without restraint up to Seabrook, five miles 
distant, to take in coal, no official question seems to have arisen in 
regard to the sanitary propriety of the free pratique that was given 
to the ship and the infected tents. 

Some of the sick that left the Delaware were sent directly to 
general hospital ; others tarried about the military quarters a day 
or two with their baggage, etc. The circumstances attending 
the progress of the epidemic indicated the following important 
facts in its local etiology : 1st. That the group of patients Threegroups 
first admitted to hospital from the Delaware^ and the sol- "^ patients. 
diers that arrived on that ship, must have received the fever infec- 
tion before leaving Key West, or during their passage and deten- 
tion on the vessel. 2d. That two distinct outbreaks, or, rather, 
two distinct waves of exacerbation, of the epidemic sub- two distinct 
sequently occurred, and were directly traceable to the of the^^* 
vicinity of the " long wharf," and the store-houses adja- ^p^'^'^™^^- 
cent to it, the first of these local outbreaks having commenced on 
the 9th of October, a fortnight after the first group of cases, di- 
rectly from the Delaware^ had been buried, and the second out- 
break having commenced October 22d. 3d. That the last outbreak 
was the most obstinate and fatal. The last admission of yellow 
fever to general hospital at Hilton Head occurred on the 10th of 
November, three patients, two of whom died on the third Epidemic 
day after admission, and one of whom recovered and ■ re- Nov. 15. 
turned to duty. 

In the last week of October a large number of cases occurred 
near head-quarters, and it was during that last relighting of the 
epidemic that Major-General Mitchell, the commander of the de- 
partment, was seized by the pestilence and for oreater General o.

YELLOW EEVER AT NEWBERN. 247 

"The records of this untimely and lamentable visitation of yellow 
fever involve some of the most important and practically interest- 
ing questions respecting the propagation and the epidemic phenom- 
ena of this scourge of the American tropics. The diagram upon 
the opposite page correctly represents the locality which became 
infected after the arrival of the Delaware at the long wharf ad- 
jacent to General Mitchell's head-quarters. No comment Medieai 
need be added to such a topographical sketch ; for every o7ufJ'TiIfec- 
physical condition that is known to favoi" the propagation **** '""S'''"- 
of the yellow fever poison was manifestly present about Long Wharf 
and the military head-quarters. 

At so late a period in the year it is doubtful if the theory of do- 
mestic origin could be successfully advocated in regard to was the 
this fatal epidemic at Hilton Head. It scarcely admits me^tic o?°" 
of doubt that the Delaware became the vehicle of the «^«««origia? 
transportation of fever poison from Key West, and that the 
" breaking bulk " for unshipping of tents, etc., while remaining an 
entire day at the head of Long Wharf; the housing and exposure 
of the tents in the quartermaster's sheds adjacent to the General's 
head-quarters; and the presence of persons with uncleansed 
clothing and " kit," discharged from the infected ship without 
sanitary control, constituted the sources of infection. 

Yellow Fever at Newhern^ N. C. — Early in the autumn of 1864, 
yellow fever raged in its most pestilential manner in Newbern, 
Beaufort, and Morehead City. Its ravages were chiefly limited to 
Newbern, and the camps in its vicinity ; its outbreak there, at the 
beginning of autumn, was attended by circumstances that led Dr. 
Hand, Surgeon U. S. Volunteers, the Medical Director opinions of 
there, to conclude that the epidemic originated on the E'j're-Si- 
spot, and was in nowise dependent upon imported infec- »°g origin, 
tion ovfomites. The rare intelligence and faithfulness of that med- 
ical officer impart a decided importance to the conclusion here 
mentioned. We must, however, admit the fact that the incessant 
communication of naval vessels between the Gulf Squadron and 
Newbern will forever prevent any positive conclusions upon the 
vexed question which to the Medical Director's mind, familiar as 
he was with all the circumstances of the outbreak, seem satisfac- 
torily settled in favor of the theory Of domestic origin. We are 
certain of the fact that, from the massing of refugees and freed 
people in Newbern and its vicinity, and from various unhygienic 
unhygienic conditions in Newbern, Beaufort, and More- <'0"'^"°'^«- 
head City, both the soil and the population were well prepared for 
the pestilence. 



248 BEAUFORT AND MOREHEAD CITY. 

During the three months in which the epidemic prevailed, there 
The number Were uDwards of three thousand deaths caused by it, and 

of fatal 

cases. of this number only about one hundred and fifty occurred 

among the old residents of the city. The first circumstantial re- 
port which the U. S. Sanitary Commission received from its agent 
there, Dr. J. W. Page, in the first weeks of the epidemic, men- 
tioned the fearfully rapid and fatal progress it was making, and it 
stated, — 

" The dead-house is constantly full. Lieutenant-Colonel Stone, and 
Dr. J. w. Major Lawson, of the 2d Massachusetts Yoliuiteers, died yes- 

Page's state- o ' ' ^ 

m'ents. tcrday ; Aid-de-Canip Hathaway died to-day ; Dr. Bell, Sur- 

geon U. S. Volunteers, in charge of hospitals, has little chance of re- 
covery ; the surgical staff is breaking down with overwork ; we need 
medical help. Dr. Pland, the Medical Director, is doing heroic ser- 
vice ; Dr. Bellargee came up to assist him, but was prostrated with the 
fever after the fourth day of arrival." 

Such was the state of affairs at the end of the first week after 
the recognition of the epidemic. We quote these facts to show its 
vehement rapidity and virulence. Three weeks later, Dr. Page, 
whose heroism and endurance enabled him to work night and day 
through the whole epidemic, wrote as follows : — 

" The mortality is frightful. The surgical staff is fearfully overworked. 
Heroism of Our Mcdical Director, Dr. Hand, has lost all his clerks. The 
cians. ^^^ timcs show more heroism and greater depth of true patriot- 
ism in these young men than even the incidents of the battle-field ; and 
those who thus offer their services after their time has expired, richly 
deserve to be noticed by the War Department." 

It will be observed that the onset of the fever was sudden, and 
its progress rapid. The vast number of northern soldiers and 
citizens, added to the crowds of refugees and freedmen, offered an 
unlimited supply of susceptible material for the pestilence. Its

Morehead City were traceable directly to Newbern ; but that at 
Beaufort, during the month of October, the epidemic gained an in- 
dependent foothold, and at this place it lingered until frost put an 
end to it. On the 24tli of October, Dr. Page wrote as follows : — 
" The mortality has been fearful. In the block above my quarters, 
fifty-five died, and in an adjacent row of dwellings, extending from Mid- 
dle to Hancock Streets, not a white person survives. Up to this date at 
least twelve hundred of the white population in the town have fallen by

The two points to which the reader's attention is imated in the 
records of this epidemic are : First — The' impossibility of demon- 
strating beyond doubt the original source of the infection at New- 
bern. Second — The persistency and wide extent of the epidemic. 

In all respects, these epidemics at Newbern and Beaufort 
strikingly resemble that which swept over Norfolk and was the 

. fever of ex- 

Portsmouth in 1855; and the evidence now before the otic origin? 
writer warrants the opinion, at least, that the exotic germs of the 
fever were planted on the banks of the Neuse, at Newbern, pre- 
vious to the outbreak of the epidemic. It is worthy of remark 
in this place, that, at Nassau, N. P., at Key West, Havana, the 
Tortugas, and especially at Charleston, S. C, yellow fever pre- 
vailed severely. Its ravages in the city last named were probabilities 
fearful. At Nassau, Key West, and the ports of Cuba, ^^'^ ^'^^°^- 
the fever poison was so intense during the summer and autumn of 
1864 that a ship or gunboat, in ordinary condition, almost neces- 
sarily became infected after tarrying but a day or two close in 
shore at the sickly ports. From twenty-two of those sickly 
places, that year, yellow fever was brought into the harbor of New 
York under quarantine. Hence, as we cannot disassociate the 
prevalence of yellow fever that then characterized the shipping of 
the Gulf and Atlantic coasts from the ravages committed by the 
infection in the towns here mentioned, we would the more care- 
fiilly jnit on record the fact, that there was a predominant opinion 
among the medical officers at Newbern and Beaufort, as well as at 
Wilmington and Charleston, that the infection w^as of domestic 
origin. Studying the facts at this later period, and after 
much inquiry, the writer regards the probabilities of an 
exotic origin in the cities mentioned much stronger than those of 
its domestic generation there. 

Yellow Fever in the G-ulf Ports, — The Gulf Squadron and the 
West Indian fruit vessels began to suffer from yellow fever early 
in the summer of 1862, and in several instances such infected 
vessels reached Pensacola and the quarantine station be- Rigid quar-

quarantine was maintained against all exotic sources of the fever. 
No vessel recently from any infected or reasonably suspected place, 
and not one that either had yellow fever on board, or that was at 
the time liable to prove infected, could obtain permission to pro- 
ceed further up than the quarantine station near the Passes.

The Galveston physicians entertained little doubt that the epi- 
demic in that city was introduced by the ship Tajnpico. The fever 
followed the soldiers as they moved out of the city. At The fever 
Melhcan, where there was a number of prisoners, there ed inland. 
were sixty-three cases and twenty-one deaths from black vomit. 
At Houston, the epidemic was exceedingly fatal. On the 12th of 
October two hundred cases of the fever were reported under treat- 
ment within the city limits ; but during the subsequent week a 
cold " norther " seemed to arrest the propagation of the infection ; 
yet before the beginning of November, and within a week after the 
" norther " subsided, the fever reappeared in its most virulent type, 
and continued to prevail until frost. 

The Experience in New Orleans — 1862-65. — Had yellow fever 
failed to appear epidemicly in the Gulf Squadron ; had not Key 
West and the Tortugas been visited by it ; and had Pensacola, 
Galveston, Houston, Sabine, Matagorda, and the towns on the Rio 
Grande remained free from the scourge, then it might have been 
reasonably claimed that there was an absence of the -^^^ Orleans 
epidemic tendency on the Gulf coast. But as we have any Guif"' 
seen, there must have existed, in 1862 and in 1864, a p°''*" 
very decided epidemic tendency in all that region. In the year 
last named it is kno^^ii that yellow fever prevailed very extensively

throughout the yellow fever zone of the Gulf; for no less than 
fifty-five infected ships and one hundred and eight 
patients with yellow fever arrived in the bay of New 
Gulf ports. York from twenty infected West Indian ports. 

The vexed question concerning the origin of yellow fever in 
New Orleans, has been discussed in that city and by medical 
writers in all countries the last fifty years, with inconclusive results. 

That the exotic germs of the fever had very frequently been 
introduced and suddenly hghted up the fires of pestilence in the 
city, was historically true ; but that some of the severest epidemics 
of the fever owed their origin to domestic causes, had long been 
believed by such trustworthy medical observers as Drs. Fenner, 
Exotic germs Axsou, and Bartou ; but that the fatal force and wide 
inp causes of diffusiou of all tlic Ncw Orleans epidemics had been 
p^ epi em ^^jj^|y ^^^ ^^ local causcs — mostly of a removable na- 
ture — was universally admitted to be true. 

In the late war, the possibility of absolutely excluding the im-

causes. General Butler's " iron rule " on the one hand, and 
Commodore Ellett's " ram fleet " on the other hand, supplied the 
requisite conditions for applying absolutely decisive tests to the 
settlement of the vexed question to which we have here alluded. 

For more than three years the Provost Marshal, the Military 
Internal san- Govcmor, the Mayor (an appointee of the provisional 
of the^city^ govemmcnt), together with the medical director of the 
post and certain subordinate health officers, have vigilantly admin- 
istered the regulations relating to municipal hygiene and cleanli- 
ness in New Orleans and its vicinity. During all that period the 
accustomed scourgings of yellow fever have been susj^ended in 
that city, while the dire forebodings and prophecies of the inev- 
itable pestilence that would quickly destroy the northern soldiery 
on reaching the Gulf coast remain unrealized. The conditions 
under which the " Crescent City " has obtained this remarkable 
immmiity from a doom which her own bitter experience seemed to

fasten upon her, are now as well understood as were the apparently 
mexorable causes of her former insalubrity. 

Such immunity from her accustomed scourging of yellow fever 
had not been enjoyed by New Orleans for the last half century. 
Even her wisest hygienists had been generally discredited and often 
derided when they publicly taught — as Fenner, Barton, Simonds, 
and Bennett Dowler had most faithfully — that the active and local- 
izing causes of yellow fever and the high death-rate in that city 
were preventable. There was a truthfulness worthy of the medi- 
cal profession, in the wofds of Dr. Barton, who, as President of the 
New Orleans Sanitary Commission, sitting in grave and scientific 
consultation upon the terrible visitations of yellow fever, unhesitat- 
ingly declared the causes of that pestilence and the city's excessive 
insalubrity " entirely susceptible of cureP ^ Still, few persons appre- 
ciated the truth of Dr. Barton's words of prophecy, when he said 
that " upon the broad foundation of sanitary measures we can 
erect a monument of public health, and that if a beacon light be 
erected on its top, and kept alive by proper attention, this city will 
be second to none in this first of earthly blessings." ^ 

Three classes of facts, concerning which neither doubt nor uncer- 
tainty can be alleged, have conspired to give precise rela- Tjjg chances 
tions and a very definite value to the series of events we f/ctkTn'ex^" 
are about to consider: Yirst. The relentless rigor and <^i"'^«**- 
precision of a military government precluded the ordinary viola- 
tions of quarantine regulations, while it gave peculiar certainty to 
the execution of sanitary regulations in the city. Second. The 
official usages and the armed discipline of the naval fleet in the 
harbor of New Orleans and upon the river, enabled the medical 
officers to trace to its source every case of yellow fever that 
occurred in the gunboats. Third. The climate of the The seasons 
City and oi the river districts, during the past three epidemic, 
years, was not perceptibly different from the climate of previous 
years and the periods of yellow fever epidemics ; the same evils 
from imperfect culture and drainage, imperfect levees and exten- 
sive crevasses, flooding and subsequent evaporation from vast areas 
of overflowed land, continued to recur in the latter as in for- 
mer years. In short, all the physical conditions that are supposed 
to promote the prevalence of yellow fever — excepting only such 
as are immediately controllable by a sanitary police — prevailed 
continually and in unusual force in the delta of the Mississippi 
during this period of immunity from that disease.

254 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. 

The medical topography of the delta of the Mississippi River 
Medical to- and of the entire State of Louisiana, is such as would be 
the delta, supposcd to favor botli the origination and epidemic prev- 
alence of yellow fever. Redeemed from the sea, but not from the 
myriad bayous and swamps connected with the overflowing Father 
of Waters, whose alluvial deposits have formed the land of the 
great delta that extends from the Red River to the Gulf, two fifths 
of the entire State of Louisiana is still subject to overflow from 
the river and its bayous, and not less than one eighth of the entire 
State is constantly submerged. By way of the Southwest Pass, 
New Orleans is about one hundred and ten miles from the Gulf, 
yet it is only six miles from the Custom-house to Lake Pontchar- 
train, one of the remaining grand inlets of the sea, forming the 
northern limits of the city. The surface of a vast district which 
has been redeemed from the bayous of Pontchartrain is at pres- 
ent two feet lower than the surface of tide- water, and eight or ten 
feet lower than the surface of the river opposite the city.

The degree of humidity is of course very high ; the average 
temperature for the " dew-point " being about 76° F. for the sum- 
mer months. The weight of moisture in the atmosphere has an 
average, during summer and autumn, of from five to seven grains 
to the cubic foot of air. Southerly and very moist winds prevail 
nearly three fourths of the time in summer and autumn. Crypto- 
gamic life is everywhere manifested by mould and ftmgi. The 
processes of putrefaction and decay are even more rapid than the 
production and growth of these low and evanescent forms of organic 
life. Green slime and putrescent eflluvia, which, previous to the 
present sanitary government, assailed the senses, were constantly

basins and canals, unless constantly exhausted and cryptoRamic 
cleansed by the drainage machines, were proHfic sources SSnd 
of pestilential maladies. ^^'^^' 

The frequent showers are succeeded immediately by vehement 
solar radiation ; and finally, as the autumn approaches, the swamps 
and the mud-soil become sufficiently desiccated to generate the 
most pernicious miasmata. We find it stated, however, that before 
the swamps were cleared, when the entire region of New Orleans 
was virtually in a state of submergence, the town was not unhealth- 
f\il. The legends of longevity of the early settlers seem almost 
fabulous ; but we find Dr. Lind stating that in his day, " the in- 
habitants of New Orleans suffer no inconvenience from their situa- 
tion in the marshes, even in the rainy season." ^ This fact, stated 
by Lind, appears probable, because the town then occupied only a 
narrow margin for a little distance back from the river, while all 
the regions beyond were constantly submerged. 

The Sanitary History of New Orleans before the War. — Con- 
stantly recurring epidemics of pestilential diseases had, Persistent 
for two generations, seemed to pronounce the doom of yeiiow fever 
the Crescent City, and, notwithstanding the vast interests war. 
of commerce, there have been dismal forebodings of inevitable de- 
cadence of wealth and commerce. Between the years 1829 and 
1855 inclusive, there were not less than twelve great epidemics of 
yellow fever, or one every second year. Those twelve epidemics 
killed 22,884 inhabitants, or an average of 1907 in each epidemic, 
which gives an average of 888 persons killed by that fever, year by 
year. As the fever prevailed to some extent almost every year, 
the actual average for each year was about 1000 victims'. 

During the epidemic years the average death-rate, fi-om all 
causes, was nearly 75 deaths to the 1000 inhabitants. The average 
annual death-rate during all that period, and up to the year 1861, 
was about six and a half per cent., or 65 per 1000. There were 
years when the death-rate exceeded ten per cent.

ways accredited as the chief source of any excessive The city fuu

period of military occupation by the national troops, a hundred

nually arrived in or passed through that city without a single indi-

vidual being smitten with yellow fever, except in the few instances 
in which soldiers detailed to assist at the boats on the levee in re- 
ceiving and conveying yellow fever patients to the Naval Hospital 
on New Levee and Erato Streets. 

The summers of 1862, 1863, 1864, and 1865 passed without any 
sign of a yellow fever epidemic. The total number of deaths in 
July, 1865, was seven hundred and ninety-three, and in August 
just past, the number was but six hundred and twenty-three. 
Compare this with the mortality in that city in August, 1853, when 
six thousand two hundred and one of the inhabitants died ! Or 
Low death- comparc mth the average mortality of the three years, 
1866. 1853, 1854, and 1855, which gave more than one thou-

during the summer of 1865.^ 

It cannot be claimed that there have been any favoring circum- 
stances in the seasons, the dryness, or the humidity, that can ac- 
count for such hygienic changes. During the four years of military 
occupation the levees have been cut and crevassed, and the country 
overflowed, more than in any former period ; and then, in August, 
1865, for example, the swampy surfaces surrounding the city were 
desiccated, less than a single inch of rain having fallen that month ; 
while in the early part of the succeeding month (September), as in 
the months of spring and summer, floods have descended.^ Now, 
from the sanitary officers of the city we learn that diseases and 
mortality have been chiefly diminished in connection with the abate- 
ment of the worst of those local conditions that are recognized as 
the localizing causes. These causes, in the language of Dr. E. H. 
Barton, consisted mainly in, —

These were the causes of disease first noticed and officially con- 
trolled by the military government under the national forces. 
From the 15th of May, 1862, until the time of the writer's visit 
to the city in July, 1865, the orders for cleansing and scavenging, 
as well as the power to enforce all sanitary regulations, emanated

i The following note from General James Bowen, the late Provost Marshal of New Or- 
leans, gives an instructive vie^v of tlie simple and effective methods by which official author- 
ity was applied in the work of sanitary government. The practical experience of General 
Bowen, not only in his official service at the South, but more especially in public institu- 
tions in New York, gives to his opinions very high authority. 

"New York, September 19, 1865. 

" My dear Sir, — I will replj' to the questions in your note of the 18th instant, in the order you 
have stated them. 

" There were no special military regulations to maintain the cleanliness of New Orleans. The Ordi- 
nances of the local civil authorities passed before the Rebellion were rigorously enforced by Brigadier- 
General Shepley, Military Governor, and this enforcement was in the main sufficient to secure thor- 
ough cleanliness. 

" The health of New Orleans was deemed to be so dependent on the cleanliness of the streets, that a 
careful surTeillance was maintained by all the military officers you mention, and any laxity observed 
was reported to General Shepley. 

" The acting Mayor, a staff officer of General Shepley until January, 1864, and subsequently Captain 
Hoyt, appointed acting Mayor by Major-General Banks, had under their control a Civil Police force, 
the members of which discharged the duties of Health Wardens. 

" The chief authority in the sanitary, as iu every other branch of the municipal government in New 
Orleans, was the Major-General commanding the department ; but the duty of maintaining the public 
health by the enforcement of the Quarantine Laws and the Health Laws of the city, was lodged with 
Brigadier-General Shepley, and it was discharged with fidelity and zeal. 

" The chief Medical Director of the department, and the whole medical staff in New Orleans, were 
assiduous in making provision to secure the health of the city — by such preventive measures against 
disease, other than the cleanliness of the streets, as were deemed necessary. 

"Two medical or sanitary commissions were appointed at different times: one by Major-General 
Banks, to select an extra-mural burial-ground, and to report on quarantine, etc. ; Dr. J. V. C. Smith, 
Dr. J. C. Faget, and Dr. Holliday constituted that Commission. The other Commission was appointed 
by myself, and consisted of Dr. G. W. Avery and Lieutenant-Colonel Tisdale. They were charged 
with the duty of inspecting the sanitary condition of all military depots and quartermasters' stations 
in New Orleans, Carrollton, and Algiers. It was an arduous duty, thoroughly performed, and they 
received the warm commendations of the commanding General. 

" From a careful ob.servation during two years in New Orleans, I am satisfied that it was only by the 
rigorous exercise cf military power in the enforcement of the sanitary regulations that the city was 
exempt from the yellow fever ; and that with the usual lax administration of such laws by civil au- 
thority, the city will again be subject to its visitation. 

" With great respect, your obedient servant,

drainage, located at the junctions of canals and bayous leading to- 
ward Pontcliartrain, maintain an important relation to civic purity 
and the public health. Some of the water-lifting machines exhaust 
from the canals and basins at the rate of more than 100,000 cubic 
feet per minute, raising the sewage from the lowest levels of the 
town, and sending it forward toward Lake Pontchartrain by way 
of the bayous.] During the frequent rain-falls, when the water 
floods the gutters and covers whole streets, cleaners were busily at 
work with hoes and stiff brooms, adding the effectiveness of their 
arms to the process of cleansing by water-flushing. 

3. The water-supply, which is wholly from the river, was, from 
Water-sup- ^^^ beginning of the military government, a matter of 
P^^' first-rate importance. Though the river surface is higher 
than the plane of the city, the supply depends mainly upon steam- 
pumps and reservoirs. The pumps were ordered to be kept in the 
highest activity, and the water company was held accountable for 
any failure in its works. 

4. Street-cleaning was hterally a cleansing ; the faithful broom

ers, thus rendering the Augean work complete. So clean a city 
had never before been seen upon the continent. 

5. Scavenging and domicihary hygiene were enforced by order 

of the Provost Marshal. Privies and garbage, stables 
and butcheries, damp and unventilated quarters, and the 
haunts of vice and debauchery, were all brought imder police 
control. The privies in populous streets, and those connected 
with places of public resort, were sometimes cleansed as frequently 
as twice each week. All animals for the markets were impounded 
at the outskirts of the city, and the cattle-boats were there scrubbed 
and cleansed before proceeding down to the commercial levees. 
And as an illustration of the salutary exercise of authority over 
improper habitations, the writer would mention that he saw all the 
tenements upon the first floor of an entire block vacated by per- 
emptory orders in a single day. 

Well-marked and fatal cases of yellow fever occurred in New 
Orleans in the autumn of 1863, and in the autumn of 1864. In 
Yellow fever the formcr year the Charity Hospital received two cases, 
b°oatiri863. both of wliicli proved fatal. Both were boat hands 
from the steamer J. H. Hancock^ a river tug. In 1864 there were 
five undoubted and fatal cases of yellow fever, terminating in black

vomit. The writer conversed with the physicians who attended 
these patients, namely, Professor Crawcour, Dr. Bennett Dowler, 
and Dr. Smythe ; and Dr. Huard has furnished notes of a case 
that occurred in the parish prison. These five cases occurred in 
persons who resided or daily visited in the vicinity of Erato, 
Tchapitoulas, and New Levee streets, near the hospital landing. 
They were exposed to known causes of the fever. Other cases 
may have occurred ; if so, they have eluded all search. 

We have referred to the two cases from a tug in the river, in the 
autumn of 1863. Nearly one hundred other cases of the fever 
occurred in the river fleet and in the Naval Hospital that season. 
The circumstantial history of all these cases shows that they were 
not of imported orionn. They nearly all occurred in Notofim- 
crowded, nlthy, and un ventilated gunboats that were at origin. 
anchor in the river at New Orleans. Owing to the inaccessibility 
of medical officers who had charge of the patients on them, the 
tabulated history of these cases gives way, in this place, to the 
more complete records of yellow fever in the autumn of 1864.

near New Levee Street, in 1864. The Naval Hospital occupied a 
Locality of pile of old buildings on that street, with yards and acces- 
pitai. " sory buildings towards Erato and Tchapitoulas streets. 
One block of buildings — storehouses — intervenes between the 
hospital and the river levee and landings. The accompanying rec- 
ord of yellow fever in 1864, in that hospital, and in the idle gun- 
boats in the stream, sufficiently accounts for the concentration of 
infection in the particular locality in which the five cases occurred 
outside of the hospital premises. Other cases occurred, but they 
were directly dependent on intercourse with the infected vessels, 
and the bedding brought from those vessels. Having, by courtesy 
of the medical attendants on the sick here mentioned, been favored 
with opportunities to make an exhaustive study of the cases of 
which we here present an abstract, it seemed a duty to place this 
record in a permanent form, in this volume of the Sanitary Com- 
mission's Memoirs.

The Monarch. — A three - decker, river- 
boat of Ellet's " Ram Fleet." Was a 
dirty old craft, bulkheaded and closed 
all around; utterly unventilated ; ar- 
rived at New Orleans from up the 
river about the 1st of Sept. Lay in 
the river opposite the city three weeks, 
then torn open for repairs at Algiers. 
A violent outbreak of the fever oc- 
curred Oct. 1st, whereupon boat and 
all on board were taken to the Quaran-

The Mobile. — This case evidently was con- 
nected with the hauling of the ship 
close to the levee, for coaling, at the 
foot of Erato Street, the infected district. 

The Kichapoo. — A Mississippi monitor ; 
a new ship. Came down the river to 
go to Mobile ; anchored near the levee 
about the 1st of October.

the wharf near the Naval Hospital. 

The Arizona. — A side-wheel steamer, cap- 
tured when New Orleans surrendered ; 
had yellow fever badly in 1863. Laid 
further up the stream than most of the 
others, probably three and a quarter

She lay nearest to the point at which 
men were engaged in building a pier, 
taking the soil from between two piers. 
This digging went on through nearly 
all the month of September. 

The surgeon, paymaster, and senior 
engineer, died in the city, but were not 
patients in this hospital. Their deaths 
occurred about the middle of October. 
They contracted the fever on board.

The Arkansas. — A steamer captured at 
New Orleans ; had been running be- 
tween New Orleans and the Texas 
blockading fleet ; lay at foot of Erato 
Street when the fever broke out ; only 
three cases were sent to the Naval 
Hospital ; about 40 occurred on board 
during a trip from New Orleans to the 
Gulf, off Texas and back to Quaran- 
tine Station (trip of 12 days) ; there 
were 14 fatal cases; the disease pre- 
vailed most among engineers and fire- 
men. Had been lying in the river for 
about three weeks before the outbreak 
of fever on board.

tory of these cases, and to the latter officer for a complete medical 
record, upon which the foregoing table is partly founded.] 

CONCLUSIONS. 
The fact appears to be indisputable that yellow fever visited 
First ap- tweuty-five vessels in the fleet anchored in the river in 
foul Tesseis, front of Ncw Orleans during the summer of 1864, and that 

long at an- , 

chor;twen- the discase appeared first, namely, as early as September 
come infected. 12th, in vcssels that had been for a long time at anchor 
there. The brief nates here appended supply the best commen- 
tary we could wish. Filthiness, crowding, excessive heat and 
moisture, and utter lack of ventilation and lighting, together 
with the stagnation of the local atmosphere of those oven-like 
boats, incident to anchorage in a tideless stream, constitute the 
leading facts relating to the infected vessels. 

To test the merit of this view of the spontaneous origin of the 
fever, the writer obtained the written history of every case of 
which any note was made at the Naval Hospital and elsewhere ; 
and also obtained from the quartermaster in charge of water trans- 
portation, a record of the one hundred and twenty ordinary steam- 
ers and sailing-vessels that were under his control. Of these 
active vessels, only one had yellow fever on board. That these 



THE KAVAL EPIDEMIC. — CONCLUSIONS. 265 

ordinary mercantile and transport vessels under control of the 
quartermaster were open, ventilated, and moving briskly about 
from place to place, yet infinitely more exposed to all sources of 
exotic infection, is the only comment this point in our records re- 
quires. 

Our records show that not less than one hundred and ninety-one 
cases of yellow fever occurred on board the twenty-five vessels 
here mentioned in the fleet at New Orleans, in the year 1864, and 
that of these fifty-seven proved fatal. Also, that in addition to 
these, there were twelve cases and three deaths among employees 
and guard at the Naval Hospital and the boat-landing on Erato 
Street. Five other cases of black vomit occurred in citizens ex- 
posed to the same cause in the vicinity of the landing. The total 
number of cases was two hundred and eight ; the total deaths sixty- 
five. At the Quarantine Station no other cases or vessels than 
those mentioned in our record were seen in 1864 ; and from July 
4th, 1863, to September 10th, 1865, only twenty-three deaths fi'om 
yellow fever occurred, and only one vessel, besides those we have 
here designated, brought cases of the fever to the Quarantine Sta- 
tion — that, the Spanish war ship Pizarro^ in 1863. 

The hygienic truths taught by the events to which this record 
refers, abundantly vindicate the principles and the methods of sani- 
tary improvement which are advocated by the medical profession.^ 
These truths may be entitled as follows : — 

1. The insalubrious circumstances that produce a constantly 
high death-rate, and the localizing causes of disease generally, are 
the most important and the most preventable causes of the epi- 
demics that afflict cities. 

2. That the climate and the topographical disadvantages that 
have hitherto been popularly supposed to be the essential causes of 
the insalubrity of New Orleans are but unimportant factors of in- 
salubrity which sink into insignificance when the preventable 
causes of disease within the city are controlled. 

1 In a letter received from Dr. E. D. Fenner, of New Orleans, September 25th, 1865, he 
says: " The experiences of the public health the past three years, strongly corroborate the 
propositions I had taught for the ten preceding years." 

In an article on the health of New Orleans, published in his Southern Journal of Medical 
Sciences, in May, 1866, Dr. Fenner saj-s: — 

"The writer only remained in the city during the first year of its occupation (1862) ; but for that 
period he can testify, from personal observation, to the extraordinary efforts that were made bj' the 

military authorities to improve its sanitary condition Such efforts were never made here 

before, although so often urged by the medical profession in previous years In spite of 

all the sufferings and sorrows incident to the war, we may still be thankful that this great sanitary 
experiment was made The exemption of New Orleans from epidemics of yellow fever dur- 
ing the period of military occupation cannot be attributed to the ag-ency of quarantine 

B'or twenty years we and some others have labored to convince the people of New Orleans that t/ie only 
way to make the city healthy is, to 7nake and keep it clean.^' 



266 THE NAVAL EPIDEMIC. — CONCLUSIONS. 

3. That yellow fever, the most dreaded scourge of New Orleans 
and the American tropics, was unequivocally generated in a large 
number of filthy and unventilated gunboats and other naval vessels 
lying idly at anchor within a mile from the densest portions of the 
city. 

4. That by fomites, or some other material agency, the infection 
of yellow fever was communicated to the guard and to certain 
other persons who were exposed in a narrow district at the Naval 
Hospital landing in Erato Street, and near New Levee and 
Tchapitoulas streets. 

5. That the infected vessels were so closely sealed in by their 
exterior covering of iron plates, that they possessed all the local 
couditions that are known to be required for the spontaneous pro-

the*habkats fectcd thiugs exccpt the clothing and pillows that went 
of the fever, ^j^^ ^^io sick to the Naval . Hospital by the river at the foot 
of Erato Street ; that all the vessels which became infected in the 
river and on Lake Pontchartrain were constantly under armed sur- 
veillance and such internal discipline as absolutely prohibited the 
transmission of any infected thing to the -shores except when ac- 
companying persons to the Naval Hospital, and that when such 
fomites did go to the boat-landing and hospital, they seemed to 
communicate the fever to the persons on guard. 

6. That vessels and river-boats of ordinary construction and in 
active service, escaped yellow fever. 

7. That the quarantine against the introduction of yellow fever 
from other places was absolutely perfect. 

8. That the fever poison which was generated in the vessels of 
the " ram " fleet proved its power to infect the locality of the 
boat-landing, and to kill a number of the hospital attendants who 
were exposed to it there. 

9. That the failure of the fever poison to propagate itself be- 
yond the immediate vicinity of the boat-landing, that the entire 
absence of yellow fever in the city, and that the absence of all 
epidemics in its population during the three years of military rule, 
is justly attributed to the excellent sanitary regulations which were 
enforced. 

10. That there can be no reasonable doubt that the restraints of 
quarantine prevented exotic causes of yellow fever from being 

\ disseminated, and possibly prevented ej^idemic outbreaks of the 
fever in the city, and that it is regarded as reasonably certain that 



PATHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 267 

with the aid of such artificial conditions as prevailed in the " ram 
fleet," the infective poison of the fever may be and was gener- 
ated at New Orleans in 1863 and 1864, and that by good sanitary 
conditions the city was saved from the pestilence that gained foot- 
hold at the hospital landing by the riverside. 

The circumstances attending the prevalence of yellow fever dur- 
ing the war, so far as we have succeeded in obtaining frill 

1 n 1 11 IP 11" ♦! Conclusions. 

records oi each outbreak, warrant the lollowmg special 
conclusions : — 

1st. That the sanitary necessity for rigidly excluding the exotic 
infection of yellow fever, was shown at various places into which 
it was imported ; while, as at Newbem, the fever became epidemic 
without being directly traceable to imported infection. 

2d. Local causes, high temperature, and humidity, were in frdl 
force at Newbern and Wilmington, N. C. ; and were in great 
excess at Galveston, Matagorda, Key West, and the Tortugas, and 
at the two latter places there was conclusive evidence that the epi- 
demic was of imported origin ; it is fair to conclude, therefore, that 
Newbem and Wilmington became infected by the constant com- 
munication they held with yellow fever ports. This conclusion is 
based upon the very strongest probabilities. 

3d. The yellow fever in the vessels at anchor in the Mississippi 
River at New Orleans, and in the two iron-clad picket boats on 
Lake Pontchartrain, certainly originated on board of them, and 
could have been prevented by the same kind of sanitary care that 
prevented both the origin and the spread of the infection within 
that city during the three years of military rule there. 

Pathological Inquiries. — Our inquiries concerning the special 
pathology of yellow fever at the various places in which Pathological 
it prevailed, revealed no important facts that were not tions?"*' 
previously well established. The first stage of the fever was, with 
great uniformity, marked by cerebral congestion and excessive ma- 
laise ; the snuffy black vomit often occurred before the third day, 
and the hemorrhagic vomiting and purging was, in many cases, 
excessive. Wherever we have recorded the prevalence of the 
epidemic, it is found that essentially the same medical and patho- 
logical facts were observed : namely, suspension of the urinary 
secretion ; the rapid subsidence of fever in cases not 
complicated by cerebral and spinal engorgement; pios- 
tration of the cardiac and arterial force, the pulse sinking to 40 
or 50 per minute, even in the walkino- cases ; and, es- 

• 11 ^1, n n -, . n The pulse.

the liver, in patients that died after the fourth or fifth day of the 
fever ; yet in reference to this point no observer, so far 
as we can learn, during the war added any new facts to 
those which Drs. A. Clark, T. H. Baclie, Leidy, and Lyons had 
presented. In a certain number of the cases at Hilton Head, and 
particularly in the patients at Beaufort, S. C, the physicians ob- 
compuca- scrvcd evideuccs of the mtercurrence or presence of 
liT^i^mait^- symptoms and pathological conditions that pertain to 
"^" paludal intermittent and pernicious fever. Similar ob- 

servations were made at two or three places in Texas, also in 
Wilmington, and in a class of cases at Newbern. 

Therapeutical Experience. — Wherever the yellow fever epidemics

such practice, except in cases complicated by the congestive mala- 
rial fever, or in cases that chanced, fortunately, to yield to the 
sedative effect of the " heroic doses " at the very onset of the 
attack. In some of the cases which occurred later in the epidemic 
at Newbern, Hilton Head, and Beaufort, where there was an inter- 
currence of congestive pernicious fever, there was manifest benefit 
from the heroic treatment. But in the early period, and at the 
acme of each epidemic, especially in the more strongly marked 
Curative hemorrhagic cases, all the resources of therapeutics 
Sfoften* oftener proved unavailing than successful ; and, as Dr. 
unavailing, j^oj^ert Lyous graphically remarked of the Lisbon epi- 
demic, " Disease, in one of its most appalling forms, held sway, 
and Art stood helpless by." 

Both in the army and the navy, throughout the regions ex- 
posed to yellow fever, where were constantly employed a thou- 
sand ships and vessels, and more than a hundred thousand north- 
ern soldiers in the national service, medical officers won greater 
triumphs by preventive measures than by all the resources of thera- 
peutics and pharmacy ; while by ceaseless and unflinching personal 
care of the sick and the well, in the presence of pestilence, the 
physicians achieved results and exhibited the true heroism and 
wisdom which have entitled them to the honors due to brave and 
skillful officers in war, and to the public gratitude that is awarded 
to savers of men.

The cases of acute rheumatism upon which these observations 
are based, occuiTed in the mihtary hospital of Fort Union, strength of 
New Mexico, in the spring of 1861. The mean strength forVuuion, 
of the garrison was two hundred and twenty-five. The ^*^ Mexico, 
command consisted of three companies of the " Mounted Rifles," 
now 3d Cavalry, and two companies of the 2d Dragoons, now 2d 
Cavalry. These troops had been engaged, during the previous 
summer and winter, in the usual expeditions against the hostile 
Indian tribes of that region. Whilst on this duty, both officers and 
men enjoyed unusual exemption from disease. The effects of pro- 
longed exposure and meagre diet, were not experienced until the 
return of the troops to their cantonments, when diseases of defec- 
tive nutrition and of mal-assimilation began to manifest themselves. 

The number of cases of acute rheumatism — twelve — occurring 
in so short a period of time, is large in proportion to the Number of 
strength of the command. The medical statistics of the rheumatism. 
army for 1855-59,^ exhibit the remarkable fact, that New Mexico 
is preeminent in respect to the prevalence of this disease. The 
number of cases in this Temtory, during the period embraced in 
these statistical returns, was 171 per 1000 of mean strength, whilst 
on the Gulf coast of Florida it was 140 per 1000 ; on the coast of 
New England, 85 per 1000 ; and in Texas, only 13 per 1000. A

270 HUMIDITY NOT A CAUSE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM. 

careful study of all the circumstances under which this singular 
result is attained, may serve to elucidate some of the obscure etio- 
logical and pathological questions connected with that disease. 

I. RELATION OF CLIMATE TO THE PRODUCTION OF ACUTE RHEUMA- 
TISM. 

That rheumatic disease is more common amongst our troops in 
New Mexico than in other localities, does not prove that there are 
in that Territory special cHmatic conditions to produce it. By 
medical authorities in general, a variable and lumiid climate in the 
temperate zone is assumed to be causative, but the climate of New 
Mexico is dry and equable, rather than humid and variable. As 
my own observations were made at Fort Union, it is necessary to 
give, somewhat in detail, the cHmatology of that post. 

Fort Union is situated in Northern New Mexico, on the eastern 
Climate of watcr-shcd of the Rocky Mountains, in lat. 35° 54',

6670 feet. The mean annual temperature for a period of five 
years was 47.80° F. The mean maximum temperature for the 
same period was 90° F., and the mean minimum temperature was 
— 5° F. But as these extremes were exceptional, a more correct 
statement of the character of the climate in this regard, will consist 
in giving the mean temperature for the seasons : —

During the same period, the mean annual rain -fall was 21.41

to the quantity of rain, the various military posts of New Mexico, 
equally remarkable for the prevalence of rheumatism, differed con-

Good Hope have occasionally been without rain for several vears, 
these diseases are more frequent in the dry climate of that com- 
mand, than in the West Indies, where the condition of the atmos- 
phere is as remarkably the reverse ; yet have extreme cold and 
atmospheric vicissitudes, coupled with excess of moisture, been 
assigned as satisfactory causes for their prevalence." A very sat- 
isfactory table illustrating the same point, is given by Dr. Forry.^ 
" It thus appears," he observes, " that these diseases (the rheu- 
matic affections) which are generally ascribed to sudden variations 
of temperature conjoined with excess of moisture, are less under 
the influence of atmospheric agency than is commonly supposed." 
There are, possibly, other climatic peculiarities, which may serve 
to account for the prevalence of acute rheumatism in New Eiectncai 
Mexico. The atmosphere of this region is remarkable E? ^°eT*Mex- 
for electrical phenomena. Land-spouts and whirlwinds '*'°- 
are of hourly occurrence. Electrical excitation of suitable objects 
is constantly observed, as, for example, the production of brilliant 
sparks on removal of the clothing at night. Hence, we may con- 
clude, although we have no specific observations on this point, that 
ozone is abundantly present. Certainly, oxidation of foul effluvia 
takes place rapidly. But little odor in the warmest weather was 
evolved fi'om the offal of the butcher's shambles in the immediate 
vicinity of the post. The dependence of catarrh and erysipelas 
upon the action of ozone, is a probable, but as yet, not an admitted 
fact. These diseases are comparatively prevalent in New Mexico. 
Erysipelas is almost the only eruptive fever observed there, and 
catarrh occurs in the proportion of 217 per 1000 of mean strength. 
We shall offer some observations to show a singular relationship 
between the erysipelas and the acute rheumatism of New Mexico. 

II. AGENCY OF THE SO-CALLED RHEUMATIC DIATHESIS. 

An hereditary or acquired predisposition, or diathesis, is as- 
sumed by most authors to play an essential part in the Diathesis, 
causation of this disease. Fuller,^ especially, is an advo- or Acquired. 
cate of this view. In seventy-one of the two hundred and eight 
cases analyzed by him, he was able to trace an hereditary predis- 
position. These numbers are not striking. In the twelve cases 
observed by me, there appeared to be no relation whatever to

hereditary predisposition — for in no case could the disease be 
traced to the immediate ancestors. 

That an acquired predisposition, or epidemic influence, existed, 
is probable enough ; but to define its characters is a problem, the 
solution of which is not yet attainable. The cases upon which 
these remarks are based occurred in quick succession, in enlisted 
men who had been exposed to great fatigue on a scant diet, but 
having for many weeks enjoyed the ample food and good hygi- 
ene of the post. There were no cases of scorbutus in the com- 
mand, nor, indeed, any evidences of a scorbutic taint. The syphi- 
litic cachexia, however, was common. Although none of the 
patients with rheumatic disease were at the time suffering from 
syphilitic poisoning, there were suflicient evidences of former con- 
tamination with the almost universal disease. Yet there did not 
appear to be any causative relations, and certainly there was no 
analogy between ordinary syphilitic rheumatism and the acute 
rheumatic disease. 

The acute rheumatism of the military post seemed to be a sub-

Bubstitution for duriug the time cases of the former were occurring in 
erysipelas, the hospital, the latter was prevailing in the surrounding 
Mexican towns, and amongst the attaches of the post, although 
not amongst the men of the command proper. The peculiarities 
of the erysipelatous disease were these : the fauces were frequently 
involved, producing great difficulty of deglutition, before the erup- 
tion manifested itself on the integument of the face ; there were 
present acute pains in the joints, with stiffiiess, but without in- 
flammation or swelling ; there were free perspirations, and an acid 
state of the urinary secretion. 

This relationship will be better studied when we have passed in 
review the symptomatology of the acute rheumatic disease of New 
Mexico. We shall then, probably, have ftirther reasons for ques- 
tioning the influence, or the existence even, of a rheumatic diath- 
esis, per se.

of the joints making its appearance subsequently. The pericar- 
ditis in these two cases was very violent, the efHision being so 
great as to produce very obvious bulging of the cardiac region, 
and to interfere seriously with the movements of the heart. 

Three of the cases presented the complications of bronchitis 
and pneumonia (fibro-bronchitis and rheumatic pneu- Bronchitis

average duration of the cases was thirty-five days. Treatment 
seemed to have but little influence in moderating the violence or 
in shortening the duration of the disease. 

The mortality was very large : two of the twelve cases proved

than is usual in New Mexico ; for a series of years the 
deaths were only one to four hundred and sixty cases. The fatal 
cases, however, were probably reported under the lesion which 
was the immediate cause of death, as, for example, pneumonia, a 
practice not infrequent in the army. Beside the inflammatory 
action in the lungs and bronchi associated with the other phe- 
nomena of acute rheumatism, my observations hai^e convinced me 
that the idiopathic pneumonia of New Mexico is of the rheumatic 
character. The difficulty of making an exact determination pre- 
vents a more substantial statement of the fact than a mere expres- 
sion of opinion. The statistics of pneumonia in that territory are 
as follows : 12.4 cases per 1000 of mean strength ; deaths 1 to 
5.7 cases. 

The two fatal cases were carefully inspected post-mortem. There 
was nothing peculiar in the condition of the joints ; but Post-mortem 
the pericardium was found to be distended with fluid, and tions. 
the large masses of lymph upon the surface of the heart presented 
in perfection that condition known as the " pine-apple heart."

274 CONCLUSIONS. 

One of the diseases may be substituted for, and prevail to the 
exclusion of, the other. 

The erysipelas manifests a tendency to attack internal organs, 
and frequently commences in the fauces and bronchi. It is ac- 
companied by pain and soreness in the joints, with lessened mobil- 
ity, and occasionally by free perspirations and acid urine. 

There would appear to be, hence, a peculiar morbific agent, 
which, applied to the integument, produced erysipelas, and when 
brought into contact, through the blood, with the fibrous struct- 
ures, produced the rheumatic disease. 

V. CONCLUSIONS. 

The rheumatism of New Mexico does not appear to have any 
relation to those chmatic pecuHarities which are frequently assigned 
as causes. 

The occurrence of the disease is apparently independent of 
hereditary tendency. 

A diathesis exists, but it must be regarded as an acquired 
diathesis. 

The atmospherical causes which have relation to it are the same 
as those which produce erysipelas. These causes are, prohahly^ 
a state of high electrical tension, absence of moisture, and excess 
of ozone. 

The strong analogies between the erysipelas and rheumatism of 
New Mexico suggest the possible identity of the two diseases, — 
the local manifestations varying with the tissue involved in the 
morbid process. 

NOTE RESPECTING THE PREVALENCE OF RHEUMATISM. 

The fact that the Medical Committee of the Sanitary Commission 
have received no communications relating to acute rheumatism, except 
the foregoing paper by Prof. Bartholow, is perhaps evidence that this 
disease, as occurring usually among soldiers during the war, presented 
no peculiar features worthy of note. It would be an interesting point 
of inquiry, whether the liability to endocarditis and pericarditis during 
the course of the disease was greater or less than in cases occurring in 
civil practice. Data for determining the answer to this question are not 
available. With respect to the prevalence of acute rheiunatism, the 
number of cases reported during the first year of the war was 26,257, 
and during the second year 45,677 ; making the total for the two years 
71,934.^ The number of cases of chronic rheumatism reported during 
these two years was 59,974. Of the individual diseases during the year

ending June 30, 1862, for which discharges on surgeon's certificate of 
disability were ordered, rheumatism is highest on the list. During this 
year there were 3585 discharges for disability attributed to rheumatism. 
That the term rheumatism, however, was often used loosely in sick 
reports and certificates of disability, is rendered highly probable by the 
manner in which the term is frequently used in civil practice. Dr. 
Woodward states that most of the army surgeons who were called upon 
to treat cases in which scorbutus manifested itself in the form of rheu- 
matic pains, having had in their previous practice little experience with 
scurvy, were accustomed to report these cases as rheumatism. He also 
states that many cases of malingering were thus reported. It is well 
known that in cases of lumbago and of neuralgia the disease is often 
called rheumatism ; and the name chronic rheumatism is apt to be ap- 
plied to all persistent affections of joints, muscles, and tendons.^ Hence, 
the figures just quoted, representing the returns made to the Surgeon- 
General's Office, doubtless afford an exaggerated idea of the frequency 
of rheumatism during the war. — Editor.

Somewhat to the surprise of those who did not appreciate the 
value of dietetic hygiene, scurvy became one of the most common 
and easily recognized diseases of the army. From the prominence 
given to it by the histories of the voyages of Anson and Cook, 
and in the subsequent explorations of Kane and other Arctic 
voyagers, it had come to be regarded as a peculiarly naval disease, 
and very many intelligent observers were astonished to find that, 
in the heart of our rich agricultural country, it might present itself 
in its most obstinate and fatal forms. 

Its first manifestation, of which we have any satisfactory record, 
First appear- ^^^ ^^ *^^^ Pcninsular Campaign of 1862, when, after

occurrence Surgeon O. M. Everts, U. S. Volunteers, says : — 

" The first appearance of any thing exciting my suspicion of scurvy 
occurred at Harrison's Landing, July, 1862. The symptoms were ex- 
treme languor and want of elasticity in the tissue ; fetor of breath and 

ecchymosis of the lower extremities Purple spots, resem 

bling purpura haeniorrhagica, were not infrequent. I did not observe 
many cases w^here the gums were much swollen or livid, and the tend- 
ency to hemorrhage was not a marked characteristic It 

was at first assumed that there could not be a prevalent condition of

scurvy. The Medical Director of the army rejected the idea, and 
many medical officers failed to recognize its presence. Surgeon A. N. 
Dougherty called attention to it, asserting the presence of scurvy in his 
command. A committee was sent to investigate the question, and fully 
confirmed it." 

From this time on, until the end of the war, scurvy became one 
of the recognized diseases of the army, and its causation Prevalence 
was made a subject of study by medical officers. It oc- war. 
curred in all armies subjected to hardships, especially in the West ; 
and it is not to the credit of officers that its worst and most fatal 
manifestation should have been made after the war had closed, and 
during the occupancy of the frontier of the Rio Grande by the 
Twenty-fifth Army Corps. This corps, made up entirely of col- 
ored troops, sailed from the James River in May, 1865. For a 
year before that, scurvy had been so prevalent as to call out from 
the generals commanding divisions and corps the warmest thanks 
to the Sanitary Commission for antiscorbutic supplies ; and we 
regret that we cannot include in this paper the earnest letters, to 
the agents of the Commission, of Generals Hancock, Burnside, 
Ord, Ricketts, Potter, Cutter, and others, which lie before us. 
Yet, in spite of all these premonitions, the Twenty-fifth Corps 
sailed for Brazos Santiago with no preventive means. At the time 
of embarkation there were some cases of scurvy reported in a few 
of the regiments. On the 23d of June, and before the troops had 
all reached their destination. Dr. George A. Blake, the Inspector 
for the Sanitary Commission at New Orleans, wrote to Washington, 
earnestly urging the Government and the Commission " to provide 
for the want that will surely exist in our army," and quoting pre- 
vious experience as to the necessity of vegetables, especially in that 
semi-tropical climate. Under this inspiration, and influenced by 
urgent appeals from the Rio Grande, the Commission shipped thir- 
teen hundred barrels of onions and large quantities of pickles to the 
Thirteenth and Twenty-fifth Corps. Of these. Dr. A. McDonald, 
Sanitary Inspector, says : " These were the only fresh or pickled 
vegetables of any kind issued as a ration to the troops previous to 
August 21st, at which time the Commissary was in receipt of a few 
barrels of potatoes, but not near enough for one good ration to the 
troops. The consequence of this want of vegetable food is appar- 
ent in the fact that the amount of sickness from dietetic diseases 
increased from one fourth of one per cent, in the month of May, 
to more than thirteen per cent, of the several commands, as re- 
ported for the month of June ; and that early in September the num-

her reported in eighteen regiments had been, from scurvy alone, six 
thousand cases. Allowing an average of seven hundred men per 
regiment, the number of troops taken sick with scurvy previous to 
September 15th would reach the astounding amount of forty-seven 
per cent, of the command reported.'''' 

We have quoted these statements merely to enforce the impor- 
scurvy inci- ^^^^ truth, that uudcr our present army ration, with the 
preiitarmy vicissitudos incident to it, scurvy is one of the most fre- 
ration. quent and embarrassing of army diseases, and one, which 

being very preventable, should attract the attention of Sanitarians 
and of the national authorities. The pecuniary loss to the nation, 
by a badly regulated and insufficient army ration, constitutes one 
of the great burdens of taxation now pressing upon the people. 
Good soldiers, without number, have been wasted during the war 
of the rebellion, and had " preventable diseases " been stricken out 
of the list of army diseases, a thousand million dollars might be 
deducted from our national debt. 

CAUSATION OF SCURVY. 

The most succinct and terse definition of the causation of scurvy 
Definition of ^^^ ^® '^^^ dcvisc, is tliis : Scurvy is a disease produced 
Bcuryy. j^y ^ ^jj^^ deficient in albuminoids and neutral salts ; or by 
external conditions which prevent their proper assimilation when 
taken into the system. The latter clause, although it is the minor 
proposition, is important, inasmuch as it accounts for cases of 
scurvy occurring on shipboard or in prisons, when the diet is 
sufficient, but where deprivation of light, air, and exercise impair 
the powers of digestion and assimilation, and favor the development 
of scurvy, or its congener, purpura haemorrhagica, in the system. 
Such instances of scurvy, occurring under a good diet, are only 
apparently contradictory of the general and accepted theor}^ of the 
disease, namely, that it is purely the offspring of a faulty diet. 

The causation of scurvy can be best studied in its pathological 
Scurvy in couditious. The deficiencies of the system are only an- 
tribS[e\*o other name for its wants ; and when, in any disease, we 
'^^®*- find a normal constituent of healthy blood or flesh absent, 

we may be sure that this absence is involved in the causation of 
the disease. Either it is absent because it was not presented in the 
food, — as in army scurvy, — or because it could not be properly 
assimilated by the digestive organs, as in prison scurvy. And, as 
none of these secondary causes exist in army scurvy, where con- 
finement, darkness, and indolence do not enter in among the pre- 



THEORIES OF CAUSATION. 279 

disposing causes, we must be right in attributing its phenomena to 
diet alone. 

The army ration is carefully, and we believe truthfully, discussed 
elsewhere in this volume. The result of that discussion. Dietetic on- 
if correct, is to show that the ration has an excess of fats by history. 
and starches, and is deficient in albuminoids, salts, and phosphorus. 
And wherever that deficiency was greatest, there scurvy most pre- 
vailed. The history of scorbutic diseases confirms this statement. 
In the scurvy, as described by early voyagers, we find a diet con- 
fined to salted meats assigned as the only cause. A httle later, 
and after the triumphant voyage of Cook around the world, in 
which a remarkably good diet was assisted by the cheerfiil temper 
that attended the whole expedition, we find melancholy and con- 
finement assigned as causes of scurvy. Lord Anson, in his " Voyage 
aroimd the World," compiled by Waller, London, 1776, says : 
" Whatever discouraged our people, or at any time damped their 
hopes, never failed to add new vigor to the distemper." Bampfield, 
in his " Tropical Dysentery and Scorbutic Dysentery," London, 
1819, says : " A diet of salted meat is not absolutely necessary to 
the induction of scurvy between the tropics, and in the summer 
season in Europe. I have seen the scorbutic ulcer induced in the 
Baltic in those who never tasted salted meats, and who were 
allowed as many potatoes and pickles as they chose to eat, with 
plenty of fi'esh lemons and lime-juice. They were not cured until 
they were sent on shore, and placed on the full allowance of a naval 
hospital, and had the advantage of a change of air." And he sen- 
sibly adds : " Scurvy may be induced in any one at sea, whose diet 
is not sufficiently nutritious^ whatever may be the articles of the 
materia alimentaria." Ballingall says : " I am strongly inclined to 
believe that all insufficient, exclusive, or artificial kinds of diet, 
persevered in, are apt to produce symptoms of this disease." Dr. 
Deas observes, with reference to the position of troops on the Black 
Sea : " I have my doubts if even fresh diet will be a sufficient pro- 
tection. Lime-juice with salted meats is certainly not so." Mc- 
Leod, in his " Notes on the Surgery of the Crimea," reiterates. 
He says : " Scurvy was the great destructive agent, and with 
which it was most difficult to cope." 

In all the uncertain utterances of the earlier writers, we discern 
only an imperfect comprehension of the facts, and a log- Discrep-

is absolutely untrue, but the truths are clouded by the- tion. 
ories previously entertained. It was evident to these students that 



280 FRESH Al^IMAL BLOOD IN SCURVY. 

the causation of scurvy was in the food provided ; but against this 
evidence stood the apparently contradictory truth, that even under 
good diet men sometimes had scurvy. To reconcile this it was 
necessary to understand that the primary causation is in the diet ; 
but that, secondarily, unfavorable circumstances of air, light, and 
exercise, may render any diet unavailable. And beyond this, it 
was necessary to comprehend the difference between the prison-life 
of the sailor and the free, out-of-door existence of the soldier. At 
sea, the causes may be mixed ; on land, they are found only in the 
food. Nearly all investigators have sought the cause of scurvy 
in some single deprivation ; some accusing salt meats, some want 
of fresh vegetables, and some the absence of certain saline ele- 
ments of the blood. All are true — none absolutely right. 

It is not difficult to find a theory of causation that will reconcile 
Scurvy de- all thcsc discrepancies. There are, at last, but three 
lack of ai- Varieties of food, namely, — nitrogenous, or albuminoids ; 
and salts. carbouaccous, or fats and starches ; and the different salts. 
All of these are alike acted upon by external causes, have the 
same relative importance, and may therefore be considered without 
reference to external conditions. The carbonaceous foods are 
never wanting in armies, and we can thence derive the conclusion 
that the absence of fats and starches is not the cause of scurvy. 
The process of exclusion, then, confines us to albuminoids and 
salts. We know that both of these are frequently lacking, and 
that in the albuminoids preserved in brine the most valuable of the 
saline constituents, with the most soluble portion of the albumen? 
are washed out. If, then, in the treatment of the resulting disease 
— scurvy — we find that a restoration of these lost elements brings 
about a return to health, the argument is complete, and none of 
the facts of the past are contradicted. 

Dr. Kane, in his Arctic expeditions, fully demonstrates this idea

Every fox that was caught was carefiilly bled to death, and every 
drop of its blood was husbanded as the most valuable of remedies 
for scurvy. This blood contained only albumen and salts, yet it 
was enough to give new life to dying men, and enable them to 
endvu'e the unending tortures of their frozen prison. As if more 
broadly to illustrate this theory of causation, the history of the war 
has repeatedly reproduced the same conditions. The rations given 
to the 25th Army Corps when at sea, were bread and bacon — in 
other words, fat and starch. After their landing at the mouth of 



SALTS DERIVED FROM VEGETABLE FOOD. 281 

tlie Rio Grande, the same food was supplied, and it was not until 
fresh vegetables and fresh meat were supphed that they recovered 
from the scurvy. In 1864 a negro regiment camped upon the 
prairies of the Cherokee Nation, and, living on bacon and hard 
bread, developed scurvy. A change to fresh beef, and the admin- 
istration of the neutral salts of potash, at once brought about a 
cure. These are only isolated instances, but we venture the state- 
ment that no existing experience will contradict them. 

The study of these discrepancies in the theory of causation can 
be simplified by a reference to the essential nature of iieaithy 
foods. Fresh, healthy blood is the typical food. It re- typical food, 
quires no process of digestion or assimilation, and, transfiised from 
the veins of one living person to those of another, it at once re- 
lieves the exhaustion of hemorrhage, and becomes a part of the 
new system in which it has found a domicile. We imperfectly 
imitate this condition in a fresh-meat diet, but in our methods of 
killincr and cookino; we sacrifice all the fluids that can be drained 
away, including all their wealth of albumen and salts. The car- 
bonaceous elements remain unchanged and unharmed. 

To supply this loss, which is much more one of salts than of 
albumen, our appetites teach us to resort to the vegetable ^he salts 
foods, the original source of the salts we have lost in our vegSie™'" 
killing and cooking of animals. By a kindly provision *"°^" 
of Nature, the fruits and vegetables, scanty in their supply of ni- 
trogenous elements, and requiring almost constant eating to ftimish 
them in sufficient quantity, have grateful acid, sweet, or sapid fla- 
vors, that constitute a sort of bribe for us to use them. Their nu- 
tritive value as starches or albuminoids is far inferior to the cereals 
and the meats. They have an average of more than eighty per 
cent, of water, never exceed three per cent, of albumen, and the 
remainder is starch and the various earthy salts. Except the 
salts, all the nutritive elements can be much more economically 
provided in the cereals and the meats ; and it therefore becomes 
evident that the salts are the valuable element in vegetables. 
They are generally combined with an excess of acid or of sugar 
that gives them flavor and induces us to crave them. 

If, then, we assume that the essential value of fresh vegetables 
is in the salts they contain, we have a solution that harmonizes all 
the various theories of the causation of scurvy. The action of 
phosphorus in building up the nervous system and the bones, 
of lime as the basis of the osseous structure, of sodium in the 
gastric juice, of iron in the blood globules, and of magnesia and 



282 VALUE OF ALBUMINOIDS AND SALTS. 

sulphur in other less readily comprehended processes, is pretty 
well understood. Healthy blood must have them, and, as they are 
all originally derived from the vegetable kingdom, we can see that 
it makes little difference where we find them — whether in the blood 
of a fox, like Dr. Kane, or in the juice of an onion, as in the san- 
itary experience of the late war. We lose these salts entirely in a 
diet of fat pork and hard bread ; we have them imperfectly pro- 
vided in a diet of fresh meats and flour with the dry, starchy vege- 
tables, as rice and beans ; and we create a perfect diet when to all 
of these we add the succulent fruits and tubers. 

It only remains to account for the comparatively few instances 
Causes of like that recorded by Bampfield and mentioned by writers 
Bcurvy. on prisou scuTvy, where a fair vegetable diet was not 
sufficient to prevent scurvy. Such instances are exclusively con- 
fined to prisons and ships, where the elements of dampness, dark- 
ness, confinement, and depression of spirits, must be taken into the 
account. These, by their depressing influence, may so impair the 
nervous system as to render even a good diet of no avail. But we 
are safe in asserting, that in armies, especially active armies, where 
exercise, air, and change of scene combine to invigorate the diges- 
tive organs, scurvy has never occurred except from the deprivation 
of albuminoids and salts. 

The relative value of these two, it is difficult to compute. Prac- 
Reiative Tai- ^ical obscrvatiou of the astonishing recoveries attending 
minoids'rnd ^^® ^'^G administration of potatoes, onions, and succulent 
salts. fruits, would lead us to suppose that the salts are the more 

essential of the two. Yet we have known commands afflicted 
with scurvy to recover without the use of vegetables, and have 
ascribed the cure to a change from salt to fresh meats, and the use 
of the neutral salts of potash. Perhaps the truth may be in the 
recognized fact that the salts are essential to the prevention of the 
decomposition of albumen in the living blood. Where any of 
them, common salt for instance, is withdrawn, the blood loses its 
due viscidity, and the globules present ragged and irregular cell 
walls. It may be, therefore, that the salts are essential, not only 
as structural elements, but as antiseptics to prevent the decompo- 
sition of the blood. All sound albumen has a decided salty flavor. 
If the albumen we feed has enough of salts, as it would have in 
fresh blood, the vegetables may be spared ; but ordinarily we must 
look to the latter for the needed preservative power. 

The use of acids, as lime-juice and vinegar, is no longer looked 
upon as a sufficient prevention of scurvy. Their action is probably

far less important than had been supposed. They are grateful 
to the taste, they assist actively in the removal of urea ^dds in 
from the blood, and they doubtless develop and give re- ^''^'^y- 
generative power to such salines as may exist in the system ; aid- 
ing, for instance, in the solution of eifete bone, and making it 
immediately available for new wants of the system. Aside from 
these doubtful uses, it is not rational, with our present knowledge 
of vital chemistry, to consider them as per se preventive or cura- 
tive. 

SYMPTOMS AND PATHOLOGY. 

The essential fact in the pathology of scurvy, as may be argued 
from the preceding discussion, is a dyscrasia which in- Essential 
eludes an imperfectly organized blood globule and a p'^**^^^"^- 
marked deficiency of saline, viscid albumen in the circulating 
fluids. The causation and the patholog;)^ are identical. What is 
absent in the food is absent in the blood ; and the train of phe- 
nomena that follows is the mere manifestation of a particular form 
of deprivation, or, in other words, starvation. 

After an indefinite period of deprivation of appropriate foods, a 
condition is developed which figured largely in certificates General de- 
of disability for discharge from the army, as " general de- fiSm*^nifes- 
bility." A soldier becomes worthless without any obvious ****'*'^" 
evidences of disease. He complains of weakness, hebetude, loss 
of appetite, disincHnation to exertion, is slow and torpid in intellect, 
has palpitation of the heart, stiffiiess and soreness of the muscles, 
and suffers from pseudo-rheumatic or neuralgic pains. Very fre- 
quently the symptoms stop here, and either some accident of diet 
brings about a recovery, or month after month may pass without 
amendment. We have seen men grow heavy, sodden, and pot- 
bellied in this way. Not sick enough to go to the hospital, they 
were kept along as " sick in quarters," still exposed to the slow 
fires of the original causes, until finally they wearied out the pa- 
tience of the surgeon, and by sheer dint of hopelessness coerced 
him into some form of certificate for discharge. These cases were 
to the discredit of the service ; for such men usually recovered 
rapidly as soon as they reached their homes and were classed as 
malingerers. 

In more advanced cases than these, the recognized phenomena 
of scurvy were presented. Simple oedema of the extrem- symptoms 
ities occurred ; the skin became remarkably sensitive to cases.

selves ; then purpuric spots appeared, principally upon the extrem- 
ities, and at first of a rather lively red color ; and later in the disease 
a condition, which we can only describe as " ecchymotic oedema," 
appeared, in which the legs, especially, became swollen and of a 
dull, purple color ; resulting from the dissolution of the blood glob- 
ules and their infiltration among the tissues. In this process of 
infiltration not the cellular tissue alone, but the muscles themselves, 
became involved ; so that the phrase " wooden muscles " has been 
applied to, them, and the patient is confined to his bed by a mus- 
cular stiffness and swelling which is almost a false anchylosis. 
Among the local manifestations we find only occasionally swelling 
of the gums and loosening of the teeth ; but it is much more usual 
to observe fetor of the breath arising from a profuse flow of saliva, 
which tends rapidly toward decomposition. 

The general symptoms at this time, are those of exhaustion. 
Symptoms The appetite is variable ; the pulse full and soft, without 
haufition. tension or elasticity ; palpitation of the heart and sudden 
faintings are frequent, and diarrhoea occurs, in which undigested 
food is conspicuous. Old cicatrices dissolve and become open 
ulcers, around which no reparative wall of induration is found, 
while the tissues around show a still further tendency to dissolution, 
and the most trivial wounds refiise to heal. The tendency toward 
death is not strong, and when it occurs, it is through the slow proc- 
ess of starvation and the gradual deterioration of all the powers 
and functions. 

The " ecchymotic oedema " of which we have spoken, indicates a 
Ecchymotic brokeu-dowu and dissolute condition of the blood globules 
oedema. -^^ which their coloring matter becomes effused with the 
serum in the tissues, and gives to the skin the deep purple, almost 
black, color mentioned above ; and, also, a lack of albumen and 
plastic elements in the liquor sanguinis. This aplastic condition is 
tersely and graphically grouped in its pathological aspects by Dr. 
David Prince, late sm-geon U. S. Volunteers, in a comparative 
sketch of the phenomena of malaria and scurvy, as manifested in 
their surgical relations. As the malarial point of view is secondary 
in this connection, we omit it, and condense from Dr. Prince the 
external pathology of scurvy. 

The bites of mosquitoes and small insects ulcerate and become 
of an ashy color with a tendency to bleed. 

When the scorbutic taint is sufficiently intense for its local 
Destructive- manifestations to be marked, its great characteristic is 

ness of tissue, ^ . r» • -pi , t •

abundantly supplied with blood yielding first — the weaker serving 
as food for the former. Thus, among tissues, cicatrices give way 
first, and among locations, the legs and feet first dissolve in ulcera- 
tion. A part of this liquefactive tendency is manifested in saliva- 
tion with fetid breath. 

In the mal-assimilation of scurvy, there seems to be a want of 
the power of cell-formation necessary to a well-developed Morbid char- 
suppuration. The abortive pus is thin and easily decom- scii.',^"^ 
posed, and in this state is easily absorbed by the virus, ^"^* 
which, in consequence of the aplastic state of the blood, fail to 
become closed on the borders of the inflammation, favoring septic 
infection through the tendency to liquefaction. The action is one 
rather of feeble than of perverted assimilation. 

Among the general characteristics of scurvy, it is remarkable 
that the appetite generally remains good to a late period. The 
various glandular excretions remain free, so that there are nowhere 
retained secretions, whether of blood-cell productions, as in the 
spleen, or of alimentary excretions, like those of the liver and in- 
testinal glands, while an active gastric juice performs its share of 
thef digestive process. 

The diarrhoea of scurvy runs off with food, showing imperfect 
duodenal and intestinal digestion of food which the appe- 

- , . . ^ , \\^ Diarrhoea, 

tite has craved, and is or a very watery character, bid- 
ding defiance to ordinary remedies, and only yielding to diet while 
the attendant fevers are extremely low in their grade and liable to

duce a thin and abundant secretion, suppressing the action of the 
heart by pressure, and swelling the knee to its utmost. The mus- 
cular swelling is attended with hard nodes from confinement of a 
similar exudation within the sarcolemma. 

A review of all these pathological conditions, with the correlate 
evidence of the causation and the symptoms, leaves little ^1,3 patho. 
or no doubt that scurvy is a depravation of the blood, d-floniX" 
consisting of a deficiency of albumen and salts, occa- deprlTadon 
sioned by a like deficiency in the food of albumen and ""^ ^^^ ^^°'^' 
the various salts derived from vegetables. This depravation is the 
offspring of direct starvation, in the shape of absence of albumen 
and vegetables in the food; or of indirect starvation in external 
causes, as darkness, want of exercise, or depression of the mind. 



286 TKEATMENT OF SCURVY. 



TREATMENT. 

It will be evident to tlie practical physician, that the disease we 
Treatment to have described, to be cured, must be treated with especial 

be based ou_ , . iii t i 

pathology reierencc to its causation and pathology ; and these two 
tion. are so identical in all their chemico-physiological rela- 

tions, that they may be considered as presenting the same mdica- 
tions. 

Starvations are sometimes total and sometimes partial. In a 
Total and total deprivation of food, few morbid phenomena are de- 
vation. vclopcd. The body burns itself out in a slow fire, and 
finally dies from an exhaustion which does not interfere, to any 
great extent, with the harmony or parallelism of the functions. In 
partial starvation, dyscrasia is produced, owing to inequalities in 
the nutritive supply. Boussingault's ducks starved to death rapidly 
when surfeited with butter. Fed on the compounds of carbon and 
hydrogen alone — and this is the common cause of army scurvy — 
the blood loses its albumen, its saline constituents, and its phos- 
phorus, and becomes a mere dilution of dextrine. 

No drugs can remedy such a condition. In spite of the materia 
Saline rem- Hicdica the lack of pliospliorus will destroy the brain, the 
edies. want of saliucs will promote the putrefactive tendency, 

and the absence of albumen will deprive the blood of its histoge- 
netic functions. It is, therefore, only among the saline drugs that 
we find any thing like a remedy ; and where scurvy depends sim- 
ply upon an absence of fresh vegetables, while albuminoid food is 
still available, we may successfully resort to the salts. We have 
already quoted the case of a regiment, encamped upon the prairies 
of the Cherokee Nation, in which a well-developed scorbutic con- 
dition was rapidly cui'ed by a change from bacon to fresh beef, 
with the addition of the neutral salts of potash. In this instance 
it was evident that the deficiency was not in sodium, and probably 
not in phosphorus, for good hard bread usually contains a nearly 
sufficient amount of that. It might be in iron, sulphur, or lime, — 
the latter hardly probable in a hmestone country, — and so, by 
the process of exclusion, potash was voted to be the deficiency, and 
when it and albumen were supplied the diseases disappeared. 

In other instances or localities, as in primitive rock regions, lime 
Phosphate niight be the deficient element ; and, when superfine flour 
ofiiuie. ^g^g used, phosphates also would be lacking. In such 
cases the phosphate of lime would be the remedy, and would im- 
perfectly take the place of the natural supply from the vegetable 
kingdom. 



A COMPLETE DIET THE MOST RELIABLE. 287 

In still other cases, and where the particular salt absent is still 
further in doubt, it would be well to combine all the elements, and 
thus reach the deficiency. 

Beyond these compensations for the existing starvation, there is 
but little to be accomphshed with drugs. In very few Remedies for 
diseases are they so totally inefficient. The diarrhoea ^*"^^<«a. 
which so frequently accompanies scurvy, is notably beyond the 
conti'ol of the usual remedies. It is a mere straining through of 
serum in the mucous membranes which lack tonicity — in a word, 
are leaky. Tonics, especially quinine, have naturally been largely 
exhibited, but with little benefit. Astringents have a somewhat 
better record. As in the allied disease, known in civil practice as 
purpura hsemorrhagica, the employment of gallic acid and other 
vegetable astringents, with port wine and acid drinks, has a certain 
degree of efficacy. The mere vegetable acids alone, as lime-juice 
and vinegar, have lost reputation, but have some value as ready 
solvents of any alkahes that may be present in the food or in the 
system. 

In all these, however, the practitioner will find himself disap- 
pointed. It is very difficult to ascertain exactly which of them the 
disease calls for, and in the absence of proper foods all of them are 
only palhative. 

The remedy for scurvy is to repair the starvation of which it is 
the result. Dr. Kane has conclusively shown that fresh q^^^^ ^^ 
and pure blood of animals will meet this indication, and r^aS'the *** 
it does so, because it meets all the possible conditions of s*a'^^*'tJo°' 
starvation, saline or albuminoid. But it is also known that land 
or army scurvy may be occasioned by either of the two starvations, 
so that we may cure by fresh vegetables alone in those cases where 
fresh beef has not been wanting, or by beef alone where vegetables 
have been in sufficient supply. Among the vegetables the onion 
and potato rank highest ; and the rapid cures they effiict lead us to 
place much confidence in the theory of Surgeon-General Ham- 
mond, that potash is the essential salt in the treatment of scurvy — 
provided always that the scurvy be fi'om vegetable-starvation. 
Om* records are loaded with instances of rapid cures effected in 
large commands by the antiscorbutic supplies forwarded to the 
army by the Sanitary Commission, and it is with some regret that 
we omit to quote them. 

It is safer, however, to rely upon a diet complete in itself — the 
same diet required to maintain the well soldier in the a complete

ness of his assimilative powers and the pecuhar cravings of his ap- 
petite. As an illustrative instance, we may cite the hospital of the 
First Division of the 16th Corps, at Selma, Ala., in the spring and 
summer of 1865, under the charge of Surgeon Murta, 8th Wis- 
consin Volunteers. Scurvy was prevalent in the command, and 
was manifested in very pronounced and painfiil forms. The treat- 
ment, owing to favorable conditions, could be made nearly perfect. 
It was almost purely dietetic, and the food consisted of young 
onions, lettuce, sweet potatoes, berries, etc., as vegetables ; with 
chickens, milk, eggs, custards, mutton and beef as meats ; while 
sour wines were allowed to special cases. The result was in all 
respects most satisfactory, and was a subject of just pride to those 
in charge. 

If we review this diet table, we shall see tliat it contains all the 
elements of healthy blood ; that in whatever salt or organic food 
the previous starvation originated, the want was made good in the 
hospital diet, which embraced such a variety as to tempt the ap- 
petite, and had such merits in cooking as to be easily assimilable. 
In this process of enriching the blood was centred the whole treat- 
ment. Drugs were mere adjuvants, and were especially directed 
to such existing complications as were detected. 

In general, we are inclined to the belief that, while the impor- 
tance of fresh vegetables in the prevention and cure of scurvy has 
not received more than its share of attention, too little regard 
has been paid to albuminoid diet, and to the mental and external 
causes that are also active in the causation of this malady.

value enough to lead us to regret that we cannot give to each the

hundred reports before us we quote remarks that serve to illus- 
trate the general mass of the material from which we have drawn 
the foregoing essay.

Professor tcers, savs that it was favorably encamped and well

REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICERS. 289 

" The first thing that attracted the attention of the surgeon was the 
uncontrollableness of diseases and the total inefficacy of medicines. 
The number of the sick constantly increased, especially cases of inter- 
mittent, in which quinia was found wholly valueless. A change of diet 
for soft bread, potatoes, onions, and fresh meat quickly removed the 
scorbutic diathesis." 

Dr. George L. Andrews, Medical Inspector of the Sanitary 
Commission, speaking of the condition of Grant's army d^. Andrews' 
at Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, in the spring '"''P"''*- 
of 1863, says : — 

" Probably many medical officers have been misled in their diagno- 
sis by the absence of swollen and bleeding gums and patches of extrav- 
asation upon the legs. . . . Yet there was at that time a good 
deal of scorbutus in that army. Many had died from anaemia, many 
from ' anasarca,' many from chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, and many 
were still suffering from these and other diseases dependent upon de- 
fective nutrition. ... I saw a cicatrix on the front of one man's 
leg, just below the knee, and said to be twenty years old, which had 
melted down under these depressing influences, and which rapidly 
healed again under improved external circumstances and the free use 
of vegetables." 

In Anson's Voyages the breaking dov^^n of a cicatrix of fifty- 
years' standing is recorded. 

Frank H. Hamilton, Lieutenant-Colonel and Medical Report of in- 
Inspector U. S. A., writing from Nashville in the spring frank h. 
of 1863, says : — ^^°"'*<^"- 

" We found in the absence of vegetable diet a cause for a great part 
of the mortality of our troops, both after the receipt of wounds and 
from other causes. Indirectly, it may account for suppurative gan- 
grene, pyaemia, erysipelas, diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, rheumatism, etc., 
and we fully believe that one barrel of potatoes per annum is to the 
government equal to one man." 

Wm. Varian, Surgeon U. S. Volunteers, writes : — surgeon va- 

rian's report, 

" In the sprmg of 1863, the 'Army of Kentucky,' of flrhich 
I was at that time Medical Director, while lying at Franklin. Tenn., 
developed many cases of scurvy, the result of long confinement to 
transports, severe marching, wet camps, and an insufficient supply of 
antiscorbutic food. At this time minor injuries, such as abrasions, con- 
tusions, etc., had an ulcerative tendency. The bites of insects, also, in 
many instances, assumed the character of spreading and sloughing ul- 
cers — in one instance of a gangrenous nature. Great difficulty was 
experienced in arresting ulcers from this cause, and the tendency to 
their production was not arrested until by a proper and sufficient sup-

ply of antiscorbutic diet the general health of the troops had been im- 
proved." 

Dr. Wood- Dr. Benjamin "Woodward, Inspector for the Commis- 

port. sion, writing from Duvall's Bluff, Ark., says : — 

" The 47th U. S. Colored Troops are suffering greatly from scurvy. 
The surgeon of the regiment and other medical officers agree that 
colored troops, having been used to an abundance of vegetables, suffer 
more from scurvy than any other class. Next are the Germans. 
Among the negro troops scurvy takes a virulent form ; the limbs be- 
come anasarcous, effusions take place into the large joints, and sores 
break out all over the body. General dropsy is frequently the conse- 
quence of the disease." 

Dr. A. McDonald, Inspector for the Sanitary Commission, in 
Dr. McDon- Speaking of the deplorable condition of the 25th Corps in 
aid's report. ^^iQ summer of 1865, when stationed on the Rio Grande, 
says : — 

" Suffice it to say, that a good ration of pickles, most of which were 
onions, followed in a few days by full rations of fresh onions, produced 
a rapid change in the condition of these men. An inspection of the 
First Division of the Corps, made within a week afler these issues, showed 
that the men were in better condition ; those previously ' sick in quar- 
ters ' were out gaining strength and cheerfulness ; those sick in hospital 
were much improved, according to the surgeons' statements and the re- 
sults of personal observation. We can only wish that means for trans- 
portation had been much more extensive, that the supply had been 
more liberal, and that Government had more quickly and fully folIoAved 
up the benevolent action of the Commission by a regular and ample 
supply of fresh vegetables for these troops. The commanding general 
and chief quartermaster of the Corps furnished an ample transportation 
after the landing of these supplies, and aided by all means in their 
power every effort for their proper distribution, in which endeavors they 
were cheerfully seconded by the officers of the several divisions." 

To continue these extracts would only involve repetitions that 
are needless. Very many of the contributions, also, relate ex- 
clusively to scurvy in its surgical aspects, and will find place in 
another volume.

Under this head we group all those fluxes from the bowels, 
which constitute in themselves the leading pathological feature, and 
are not merely accidental or intercurrent with other diseases. 
Thus limited, diarrhoea and dysentery, common as they are in civil 
life, figure as the great scourge of camps and armies. Under 
various names, designed to indicate some peculiar malignancy, 
these maladies have formed a prominent feature in the necrology 
of all wars. Records of the armies of antiquity abound in in- 
stances of their ravages, while the improvements of modem 
science, medical and military, have not sufficed to do more than to 
limit and, in some degree, control their destructive power. 



292 PREVALENCE IN UNITED STATES ARMY. 

The records of the British armies abound in facts of this nature. 
Frequency Colonel Sir A. M. Tulloch states, that out of an aggre- 
taacrofthese g^*® ^^^ 25,433 mcu of His Majesty's army, serving in 
diseases. Bengal Proper, from 1823 to 1836, there occurred 8499 
cases of dysentery and diarrhoea. In Madras, from 1842 to 1848, 
82,342 men furnished 19,720 cases of the same diseases. Martin 
says : ^ " The losses of the French army in Egypt were greater by 
dysentery than by the plague ; the deaths by the latter diseiase being 
1689, while by the former they were 2468. During two and a half 
years the British army on the Peninsula lost 4717 men by dysentery." 

Assistant-Surgeon Woodward, U. S. A., in Circular No. 6, gives 
Prevalence a mucli larger ratio of these diseases than any stated 
states army, abovc. To explaiu tliis it need only be mentioned that 
the United States system of medical reports includes tlie slight 
cases that appear at sick-call, as well as the graver kind that find 
a bed in hospitals ; and that the acute and chronic forms of both 
diarrhoea and dysentery are included in the statement, and wisely, 
inasmuch as the chronic diarrhoea of many of the reports w^as 
really an ulcerative disease of the mucous membranes which 
might, with equal propriety, be classed as dysentery. By group- 
ing, therefore. Dr. Woodward retains a tinithful and striking state- 
ment that would be lost in any over-nice attempt at classification. 
He says : — 

" The extreme frequency of diarrhoea and dysentery makes it most 
important to understand these disorders. They constitute more than 
one fourth of all the cases of disease reported during the period 
under consideration. The annual number of cases for the whole army 
was greater than three fourths of the mean strength, and, next after 
camp fever, they were the chief cause of mortality from disease. The 
total number of cases reported during the first year was 215,214, with 
1194 deaths; during the second year, 510,461 cases and 10,366 deaths ; 
the total 725,675 cases and 11,560 deaths. It will be seen that the pro- 
portionate mortality of the second year is by far the greatest, showing 
the prevalence of cases of a more formidable type." 

The annual ratio of deaths per 1000 of mean strength for the 
first year of the war was 4.10 ; for the second year, 16.08 ; for the 
two years, 12.36. The statistics of the last two years of the war 
are not available. It is believed, how^ever, that they would exhibit 
no diminution in the frequency or mortality of these diseases. 
Dr. Woodward remarks, that " a certain length of time is required 
before the influences to which a soldier is exposed culminate in 

1 On Tropical Diseases, London, 1856. 



ABDOMINAL SYMPTOMS. 298 

clironic diarrhoea." And it may be further remarked that these 
influences are constant; that the soldier does not generally, or 
oftA, become acclimated or accustomed to them ; and that second 
attacks are extremely common. 

In the military prisons of the Southern Confederacy these dis- 
eases assumed a horrible frequency and mortality. From prevalence 
a report made by Dr. Joseph Jones, C. S. A., to the Con- federat?"" 
federate Surgeon-General, we group the following fright- p"'^"'^^- 
ful statistics from the Confederate States army-prison at Anderson- ' 
ville, Georgia. During the six months from March to August, 
inclusive, in 1864, there occurred 4529 deaths from diarrhoea and 
dysentery among less than 40,000 Federal prisoners confined there 
during that time. Later than that, we are given to understand, 
the mortality was largely increased ; as, on the 21st of September, 
the deaths up to that time, from all causes, were stated at 9479, 
from a total population of 40,611 ; that is, one in 4.2 or 23.3 per 
cent, of the prisoners died.^ None of these deaths are included 
in Dr. Woodward's tables ; and in view of the fact that his statis- 
tics, gigantic as they are, include only the first two years of the 
Avar, with much smaller armies than those of the two following 
years ; and, in the case of the Andersonville prison, fail to include 
the far more melancholy autumnal period that succeeded, we need 
say nothing more as to the importance and frequency of these dis- 
eases in our army, or of the imperative duty of careftilly search- 
ing out their laws of causation. 

Symptomatology. — The diseases under mention are usually pre- 
ceded by constipation, and are ushered in by frequent, Abdominal 
usually painless movements, attended by some anorexia ^y'"?*"™^- 
and general malaise. As the disease progresses, it exhibits more 
pain, uneasiness, flatulence, and abdominal gripings, often preceding 
the stool, which being over, the painfril sensations cease only to 
return again at gradually decreasing intervals. It often happens 
that a certain periodicity manifests itself, the night being passed in 
quiet and comfort until nearly daylight, when griping stools occur 
with great frequency until toward noon, after which they decrease 
in number. This periodicity does not, however, present the usual 
phenomena of intermittents, and is not amenable to quinine. The 
stools present no uniform characters. Even in the same patient 
they vary remarkably from hour to hour : now like pea-soup ; 
again frothy hke soap-suds, and accompanied with much gas ; and 
at other times containing undigested food, or exhibiting all shades

is red and dry, the eye prominent. As emaciation proceeds, the 
skin is tightly retracted across the cheek-bones, dirty, brown dis-

and emits an offensive odor. Sometimes in gi*eatly prolonged 
cases there is oedema and general paleness. In the fatal cases the 
patient perishes from mere exhaustion, or passes off in a feverish, 
muttering dehrium. 

Pathology. — The essential fact in the pathology of all these 
various forms of flux is the same, and autopsies reveal no distinc-

intestine, or of both, attended by ulceration of the mucous mem- 
brane. The solitary follicles of the colon are seen to be enlarged 
simply, or ruptured, with punched-out ulcerations following. The 
intestinal wall is thickened and changed in color to a red, brown, 
black, or greenish hue. As ulceration extends, it burrows in the 
sub-mucous connective tissue, ulcers thus communicating with 
each other by sub-mucous canals. The edges of the ulcers be- 
come undermined, overhanging, and ragged, w^ith sloughs. In 
other cases a caco-plastic lymph, greenish or black in color, and 
very nearly identical with the false membrane of diphtheria, is de- 
posited. Sometimes these deposits are detached and found in the 
stool as a tubular cast of the intestine. 

The seat of these ulcerations is usually in the large intestine 
and the ileum and the point of the origin of ulceration is in the 
solitary follicles, and not in the agminated glands. They are 
sometimes attended by metastatic abscesses in the liver, and often 
by apthous or diphtheritic exudation in the mouth and air pas- 
sages.

process of waste has gone so far, that it is very difficult to set up a

of that most important muscle — the heart. The pulse becomes 
very rapid, and what is called " functional disease of the heart " is 
recognized, or there may be developed actual and permanently dis- 
abling organic disease. So, too, the brain suffers its form of star- 
vation. A dull apathy settles upon the patient, and sometimes 
actual insanity follows. This was frequent at Anderson ville. 

No mere record of deaths, like that we have given in preceding 
pages, can express the grand total of the loss by these diseases. 
They live in their sequelae, in the cachexias which attend pro- 
longed starvation, and their necrology can only be complete when 
we have counted the unnumbered deaths which have occurred 
after the return of the soldier to his home. 

Medical Geography. — There is no part of the United States 
where diarrhoea and dysentery are not endemic. Their causation 
exists in a greater or less degree at all places ; and the history of 
the late war seems to indicate that even in periods of their greatest 
frequency they were not truly epidemic, but owed their increased 
vigor to the presence of a greater number of the usual causes in a 
more active condition. Geographically, however, lines of demar- 
cation can be drawn between districts only slightly subject to their 
attacks, and others which develop them in great number and 
fatality. And by a comparison of these we shall be able to segre- 
gate the climatological from the special causations. 

Forry,! in discussing the mortality of the U. S. army, as it 
existed twenty-five years ago, shows that at the various Forry'sgeo- 
posts in the Northern Division the proportion of deaths SJi'^an?' 
to cases, from fluxes, was 1 in QQS ; while in the South- s***"^*'*^^.

We are thus authorized to conclude that the climatological 
causes producing intermittents have also a large influence conclusion 
in the causation of fluxes and in determining upon them agency ofthe 
a fatal tendency. In the paludal districts of the Central intTmiftent 
Region the cases are both more frequent and more fatal ^®^'"'- 
than in the less miasmatic regions occupied by tlie greater portion 
of the armies east of the Alleghanies. In the general hospitals the 
eflect of latitude (through climatological conditions) is thus men- 
tioned by Dr. Woodward : — 

" During the second year of the war, the proportion of deaths from 
chronic diarrhoea and chronic dysentery in the general hos- ^"g^^^^f 
pitals of New England was one in every forty-nine (48.8) ^^*jj*^j®^'^ 
patients admitted for these disorders; in the general hos- hospitals. 
pitals of New York City and State, including the hospital at Newark, 
New Jersey, one to every nineteen (18.7) cases ; in the general hos- 
pitals of Pennsylvania and Delaware, one to every fifteen cases ; in the 
general hospitals of Maryland and the District of Columbia, including 
those of Washington, Georgetown, Alexandria, Frederick, Baltimore, 
Annapolis, etc., one to every eleven cases (11.4) ; in the general hos- 
pitals at Fortress Monroe and on the coasts of North and South Caro- 
lina, one to every seven cases (7.1). 

" The mortality was greater in the central region of the Continent, 
but the relative influence of latitude was still observed. In the general 
hospitals of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and Ken- 
tucky, including those at Cincinnati, Louisville, and St. Louis, the 
mortality was one death to every nine (8.53) cases ; in those of Ten- 
nessee, Northern Mississippi, and Arkansas, including among others 
the hospitals at Nashville, Memphis, and Helena, one in five (5.4) ; in 
the hospitals of Louisiana, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, 
one in four. 

" Nor will a separate consideration of the mortality from these affec- 
tions in the hospitals of the great cities on the Mississippi River be less 
instructive. In the hospitals of Keokuk, Iowa, the mortality was one 
in nine cases (9.1) ; in St. Louis, one in five (5.2) ; in Cairo, one in 
four (3.98) ; in Memphis, one in five (5.4) ; and at New Orleans, some- 
what less than one in five (4.7). The extreme mortality, it may be 
noted, is not at the point furthest south, but at Cairo, situated on the 
alluvial peninsula formed by the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio

rivers, where, as is well known, most intense malarial influences pre- 
vail." 

But a flirther investigation will show that latitude is not the 
only causative element among the geographical or climatological 
Causes in- conclitious. Thus wc find, that on the annual isotlierm of 
of latitude. 48°, iucludhigthe New England States on the east, and the 
hospitals of Wisconsin and Iowa on the west, the eastern mortality- 
was one in every forty-nine patients ; the western mortality was 
one in every nine cases. The isotherm of Washington (^56°') is 
also the isotherm of Cincinnati and Louisville ; yet the former 
has a mortality of only one in every eleven cases, while the latter 
have a mortality of one to every nine. Fort Monroe loses one in 
seven. Memphis, on the same isotherm, loses one in five. And 
from Cairo south the mortality decreases. 

Latitude, then, if we accept it as a mere expression or synonym 
of heat, is not the only cHmatological element of causation. Marsh 
miasm must be included as a combined element, and its due im- 
portance should be recognized. 

Altitude. — Elevation constitutes an important element in caus- 
Prevaience atiou. Universal experience has proven that these fluxes,

uch as were occupied by vast numbers of our troops in 
the Mississippi Valley. The great camp held by Grant and Sher- 
man, in the bend opposite Vicksburg, in the early period of the 
siege of that city, combined the causative elements of heat, humid- 
ity, and low grounds. Most of the camps immediately on the 
shores of the western rivers, were so low as to be subject to inun- 
dation, or were only protected by levees.

mission to Inquire into the Sanitary State of the Army in India " 
(London, 1861), thus accounts for their failure : — 

" The majority of the stations being on the outer face of the moun- 
tain ranges, and at an elevation where the heaviest rains occur, receive 
the first impact of the monsoon, and the consequence is that they are 
all wet and subject to cold fogs. The annual rain-fall in the Hima- 
layan stations varies from seventy inches to one hundred and thirty 
inches, as at Darjeeling. The rain-fall at Mahableshwur, in Bombay, is 
actually two hundred and forty inches pei- annum One 



DIETETIC CAUSES. 299 

thing is quite clear, that it will never do to trust simply to elevation 
above the plains to keep the army in health. Malaria has been blown 
up the ravines in India far above the fever range, over sites otherwise 
perfectly healthy ; and those who slept within its influence have been 
attacked with fever and died." 

In the far less humid climate of the United States, it has usu- 
ally been possible to attain either altitude or those atmos- NewEng- 
pheric qualities that we seek in altitude, namely, a cool, tais. 
dry, rare, and non-mala'rial atmosphere. Such were the conditions 
that obtained in the New England hospitals, and rendered them so 
successful in the cure of fluxes. Only two hospitals were con- 
structed with special reference to securing a considerable altitude. 
One of these was at Claysville, on the mountains near Cumber- 
land, Maryland ; the other on Lookout Mountain, near Chat- 
tanooga. 

We have thus endeavored to estimate the causative importance 
of general geographical or climatic conditions in the production of 
fluxes. In the main, the troops of the West had the same food, 
shelter, and clothing as the troops in the East ; and their vastly 
greater mortality must be, therefore, ascribed to climatic and geo- 
graphical causes. Yet there were not wanting many instances in 
the West to show that it rests within the power of a wise hygienic 
administration to control, in a great measure, these general 
causes, and, so to speak, to lock the doors of the system against 
their ingress. 

Special Causes. — Among the special causes which promoted 
and assisted the climatic conditions may be enumerated Enumera- 
defective diet, exposure to rapid radiation of animal heat, gp°j°[ 
crowd-poison, and depressing mental agencies. These <'^"^®^' 
causations, powerful enough in themselves to create fluxes on 
northern hill-sides, were terribly reenforced in the hot, malarial 
valleys of the South ; yet it was found that the climatic causes 
could be successfiilly resisted, provided the special causes could be 
controlled and avoided. 

Opinions among army surgeons differed largely as to the causa- 
tive value of foods. With some the army ration was Dietetic 
looked upon as the active generator of these diseases, *"^"^®^- 
while others laid more stress upon those conditions of exposure, 
such as sleeping on the damp ground, etc., all of which resolve 
themselves into a too rapid radiation of animal heat, a chilling of 
the surface, and a consequent tendency to internal congestions. 
Probably the truth lies between the two, and partakes of both. It 
was usually after difficult marches, or the exposure of siege opera- 



TOO THE BIVOUAC A SPECIAL CAUSE. 

tions, that diarrhoea became prominent. Such labors usually in- 
volved all the special causes under consideration, and it is not easy 
to ascribe to any one its relative importance. 

Great stress was laid by Dr, Salisbury (vide " Appendix to Report 
of Surgeon-General of Ohio " for 1863) on the excess of starches 
in the ration, and the hard army biscuit was accredited as the 
great cause of chronic diarrhoea. Torula were certainly found in 
the dejections, and perhaps other algoid forms. It is also true 
that in chronic diarrhoea starches are very imperfectly digested, 
often undergoing fermentation and decomposition into carbonic acid 
gas, and doing much to perpetuate the disease. But it is not yet 
proven that starches create the fluxes in systems subjected to no 
other elements of causation. The proof, as it now exists, goes no 
further than to show that an excess of starches is a very unfit diet 
for men exhausted by fatigue and exposure, and under those cir- 
cumstances becomes provocative of disease. The physiological 
facts indorse this theory. In a diet too exclusively of starch, or 
of fats and starches combined, the whole digestive labor is thrown 
upon the small intestines. The stomach renders little assistance, 
and the system is mainly deprived of albuminoids. And the his- 
tory of the disease shows that as diarrhoea progresses the intoler- 
ance of starch increases — a phenomenon that cannot be due to its 
carbonaceous character merely, because fats are at the same time 
often well digested, and prove very beneficial in supporting the 
system.^ 

Scurvy occupies a prominent position among the causes of 
Agency of diarrhoea and dysentery. That degeneration of the blood 
scurvy. 'g ^Imost always due to some form of starvation, usually 

of fresh vegetables and albuminoid foods. It uniformly presents 
itself among troops who have been fed too exclusively on hard 
bread and bacon, and is as uniformly absent where free foraging is 
allowed. In the same ratio we find the fluxes and the scorbutic 
taint usually complicates them. Its most pronounced form, in 
which it becomes almost or quite a purpura haemorrhagica, may be 
absent, or none of the physical signs be present. Yet its more 
secret manifestations in lumbago, rheumatic pains, and general 
malaise are nevertheless present to mark its influence in the causa- 
tion and perpetuation of the diarrhoea or dysentery. 

The bivouac is another active, special cause. Wherever we 

1 An amusing instance of dietetic causation of diarrhoea occurred in the observation of the 
writer, when an entire army corps for several daj's received no rations except fresh beef, and 
either corn in the ear, or later, corn-meal. No salt could be procured, and as a consequence 
there was a lack, of gastric juice to digest the beef. The result may be imagined. It was 
a universal diarrhoea which, however, left no permanent injury behind it. 



CROWD-POISON, FILTH, AH^D STARVATION. 301 

travel in southern latitudes, and especially in paludal regions, we 
find that instinct and tradition have taught the people The bivouac 
to raise their houses from the ground. They rarely dig ca^^!* 
cellars, but they set the frame of their dwellings on posts, allowing 
the air to circulate freely beneath the floor. This essential hy- 
gienic precaution is necessarily neglected in the bivouac, and too 
often in camps of a more permanent nature. The result is, that 
the soldier, after the fatigues of the day, rolls himself in his blanket 
on the humid ground, rapidly parts with his animal heat, and often 
wakes during the night — even in tropical regions — to find him- 
self chilled, and to feel the poison of terrene miasms creeping 
through his system. Internal congestions result, and manifest 
themselves more frequently in diarrhoea and dysentery than in any 
other method. And by way of contrast, it may be mentioned that, 
in winter, when great camp-fires are maintained, or in the hot 
seasons, in the arid and invigorating breezes of the great plains of 
the West, the bivouac rarely aflfects the health of troops. 

Previous attacks of diarrhoea or dysentery often assume a place 
among the special causations. Unlike camp fevers, the predisposi- 
fluxes have a tendency to repeat themselves. For a long prev/oiT 
time after an apparent cure of chronic flux, it is easily *"'^''^8- 
renewed by a careless diet or by undue exposure. Thus, this dis- 
ease manifests a constantly increasing tendency. Veteranship is 
no protection against it, and so far as statistics prove anything on 
this point, they show that the longer a soldier has been subjected 
to the vicissitudes of a campaign, the more likely is he to have 
diarrhoea or dysentery. In the first year of the war, the ratio of 
death, per thousand men, from these diseases, was 4.10 ; in the 
second year it was 16.08. It is believed that, like scurvy, gan- 
grene, and secondary hemorrhage, the fluxes will be found to have 
similarly increased in fatality during the third and foui'th years of 
the war ; while camp fevers, on the other hand, will exhibit a 
decreasing ratio. 

Crowd-poison, Filth, and Starvation are causative elements that 
usually coexist. To some extent, they doubtless existed crowd- 
in the Union armies, but were always evils of short con- poi«°°'«*<'- 
tinuance ; nor do our records exhibit any facts which would au- 
thorize scientific deductions. Unfortunately, however, a study of 
these causes is presented to us in the terrible statistics of the Con- 
federate prison at Andersonville, Georgia. And, lest we should be 
accused of exaggeration, we shall confine ourselves entirely to the 
facts as reported by Surgeon Joseph Jones, C. S. A., in his official 
communications to the Confederate Suro-eon-General at Richmond. 



302 CAUSES AT THE ANDERSONVILLE PRISON. 

Dr. Jones was ordered to Andersonville (Camp Sumpter) to un- 
dertake pathological investigations there — a duty which he per- 
formed with marked humanity and zeal, though without succeeding 
in procuring the necessary ameliorations. 

The causes of disease, however, were carefully studied, and 
Causes at sccm to cxcludc all cxcept controllable dietetic and sani- 
sonvtu?^'^" tary conditions. Thus, the elevation is stated to be four 
Prison. hundred and thirty-five feet above the level of the sea. 
Of the soil Dr. Jones speaks as " sandy, with but little vegetable 
mould," and in the sand the microscope detected no organic re- 
mains. Geographically, Camp Sumpter is upon the upper margin 
of the tertiary, " or more properly, the upper or burr-stone strata 
of the eocene formation." Of the water, he says : " I carefully 
analyzed the waters from various localities, and found them remark- 
ably pure ; the water of the wells and small streams did not differ 
to any extent in specific gravity from that of distilled water, and 
contained only traces of the chlorides and sulphates and of the 
salts of hme, magnesia, and iron. The well of water upon the 
summit of the hill on which the Confederate General Hospital is 
situated, is of remarkable purity, and, in fact, it may be consid- 
ered as equal to the purest well-water in the world." Of the 
waters of the stream passing through the stockade, he says they 
" are of great purity, containing only traces of the sulphates and 
chlorides of lime, magnesia, and iron." As to climate, it is in lat- 
itude 32°, at an elevation not sufiicient to affect the temperature, of 
which he says : " The mean temperature of Andersonville, Geor- 
gia, may be assumed, without any great deviation from the truth, 
at about 65° for the spring, 82° for the summer, 65° for the 
autumn, and 55° for the winter; or 65° for the year." The pre- 
cipitation of rain at Perry, thirty miles from Andersonville, is 46.7 
inches per annum. He speaks of the climate as generally " more 
salubrious than one half the territory of South Carolina, Georgia, 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana " ; and, in summing up, says, 
with painfull emphasis : " In conclusion, as far as my physical and 
pathological investigations extended, I was compelled to believe 
that the diseases that proved so fatal to the Federal prisoners con- 
fined at Andersonville, Georgia, were due to causes other than 

those connected with the soil, water, and chmate 

The heat may have proved a cause of debility, but still the fear- 
fiil mortality could not properly be referred to this condition of 
climate, or to all the other elements of climate combined." 

Yet, in a locality tlius chosen, and which excludes all the climat- 
ological causations of the diseases under question, a period of only 



MORTALITY IN ANDERSONVILLE PRISON. 303 

six months with a population varying from 7500 to 32,000, and 
aggregating less than 40,000 admitted to prison, the number of 
deaths from diarrhoea and dysentery was 4529, and if we add to 
that the deaths from scurv}^, 5528. The total mortality from all 
causes was, in the six months of March to August, 1864, inclusive, 
7712. In the period from February 24th, 1864, to September 21st, 
1864, the mortality from all causes was 9479. Dr. Jones says in 
his report : " The entire number of Federal prisoners confined at 
Andersonville was about 40,611 ; and during tlie period of near 
seven months from Februaiy 24th to September 21st, 9479 deaths 
■were recorded. That is, during this period, near one fourth, or 
more exactly one in 4.2, or 23.3 per cent, terminated fatally." 

By the process of exclusion we are compelled to believe that, in 
the absence of chmatic causes, this " fearful mortality " w^as due 
exclusively to the very controllable causes of crowd-poison and 
starvation. In reference to the first of these. Dr. Jones gives the 
following statement, which we copy, premising that, during the 
month of June, the area of the prison was enlarged from seventeen 
to twenty-seven acres : —

This area consisted of two opposing hill-sides, divided by a 
stream, with swampy margins not inhabitable. How much this 
stream and swamp decreased the general area is not stated. " It 
was," says Dr. Jones, " covered with the excrements of the men, 
and thus rendered wholly uninhabitable, or, in fact, useless for 
every purpose except that of defecation." This area was further 
decreased by the internal arrangement of the camp. We continue 
to quote from Dr. Jones : — 

" But few tents were issued to the prisoners, and these were, in most 

cases, old, torn, and rotten No shade tree was left in the entire 

inclosure of the stockade. With their characteristic ingenuity and in- 
dustry, the Federals constructed for themselves small huts and caves, 
and attempted to shield themselves from the rain, and night-damps, and 

dew In the location and arrangement of the tents and huts 

within the stockade, no order appears to have been followed ; in fact,

regular streets appeared to be out of the question in so crowded an 
area." 

Thus we find that in this abyss of horror an average of about 
one rod square of area was considered enough for six men to per- 
form all the offices of life, of sleeping, exercise, cooking, and the 
offices of nature. In such a crowd, filth was inevitable. Let Dr. 
Jones describe it : — 

" More than thirty thousand men crowded upon twenty-seven acres 
of land, with little or no shelter from the intense heat of a southern 
summer, or from the rain and dew, with coarse corn-bread from which 
the husk had not been removed, with scant supplies of fresh meat and 
vegetables, with little or no attention to hygiene, with festering masses 
of filth at the very doors of their rude dens and huts, with the greater 
portion of the banks of the stream flowing through the stockade a filthy 

quagmire of human excrements alive with working maggots The 

slightest scratch of the surface, even to the bite of small insects, was 
frequently followed by such rapid and extensive gangrene as to destroy 
extremities, and even life itself." 

The picture needs no further touches. In this filth and starva- 
tion of a crowded mass of helpless humanity, all the purer and 
nobler instincts perished by atrophy ; mind and body starved to- 
gether, and the sad fatuity and apathy of the one was no less pain- 
ful than the emaciation of the other. Here is exhibited the vast 
power of causes of diarrhoea and dysentery, which are known to 
be controllable ; and the still more repulsive feature of the power 
of man to create, organize, and systematize morbific elements, until 
they become an engine of death more fatal than the battle-field.

was found that a thorough purgation of the bowels from all irritants 
was the best and most speedy method of securing rest and open- 
ing the way for the successful administration of opiates. Vast 
numbers of cases were thus successfully terminated.

exposed to the causes of his malady ; and it came to be a fixed 
doctrine at southern and southwestern stations, that confirmed 
cases had no security for cure except by removal to the North. 
This soon became a governmental policy, and hospitals were es- 
tablished in New England, along the lakes, and in the Northwest, 
to which chronic cases were sent in great numbers. Among 
patients not thus removed, but treated in southern hospitals, much 
vacillation and irresolution were exhibited in the prescriptions of 
surgeons ; as happens in all diseases the treatment of which by drugs 
is usually unsuccessful. To trace the history of an individual case, 
w^as to find that the prescriber had run the rounds of all remedies, 
from opium to astringents, from astringents to quinine, from quinine 
to bismuth, and from bismuth to nux-vomica, from nux-vomica to 
mercurials ; returning almost always to opium as the drug which 
at least alleviated, if it did not cure. 

The value of drugs was, perhaps, over-estimated, in this as in all 
other diseases of assimilation, and only a careful avoid- vaiueof 
ance of the original causes of the malady, and an equally SFma^^^" 
careful recognition of their continued existence in the ^s^^^^^- 
system, could secure any degree of success. The scorbutic and 
the malarial taints were almost uniformly present, the former very 
frequently in as pronounced a form as the latter. The bowels, 
enfeebled by the inflammatory process, were unable to perform 
their normal fimction of the digestion of starches, and the diet, 
therefore, became necessarily albuminoid. A full nutritious diet 
of albuminoid and antiscorbutic food assumed the first importance 
in the treatment. Coupled with this came pure air and absolute 
cleanliness. And with these hygienic measures alone, when they 
could be properly enforced, it was possible to treat chronic diar- 
rhoea and dysentery with a fair degree of success, even in the 
great heats of a southern summer. 

In the month of May, 1865, the First Division of the 16th Army 
Corps reached Selma, Ala. Its service had been pecul- Experience

avoidably been deficient. Scurvy, in its most pronounced and 
obvious forms, was prevalent, and with it many cases of chronic 
diarrhoea. It was determined to fully test the dietetic and hygi- 
enic treatment. A large, cheerful, and airy ward was assigned to 
''• diseases of starvation and assimilation," under charge of Surgeon 
Murta, hospital surgeon of the division. The patients were fre- 
quently bathed or sponged. Then- shirts and bedding were often 
changed, and a warm covering at night was insisted upon. The

police of the ward was extremely stringent. The diet consisted of 
eggs, custards, milk, chickens, beef and beef soup, and fresh vege- 
tables, as tomatoes, onions, lettuce and greens, with a very slender 
allowance of bread. No corn-starch, arrowroot, or gruels were 
allowed. As a stimulant, claret wine was employed for those not 
requiring so active a stimulant as brandy or whisky. Drugs of all 
sorts were, as far as possible, excluded, being employed only pro re 
natd, for temporary emergencies. Under this regimen a most grati- 
fying measure of success was obtained, and the records of that 
hospital would compare favorably with many of the more fortu- 
nately situated northern sanitaria. 

It has become a confirmed belief with the writer, that the dis- 
importance eascs uudor qucstiou are not, in our present state of 
measuiM.^" kuowlcdge, to bc curcd by the apothecary ; and that no 
treatment will be successftil that does not reverse the causative 
conditions. As the patient has been exposed to cold, fatigue, ma- 
laria, filth, and starvation, he must now be subjected to warmth, 
rest, pure air, cleanliness, and nutritious diet. As under these nat- 
ural remedies, his mind becomes cheerftil, his nervous system ac- 
quires tone, his starved and attenuated muscles are reconstructed, 
it will be found that the local follicular or ulcerative disease slowly 
disappears, and the function of intestinal digestion is at last re- 
stored. But in all cases the process is likely to be tedious, and 
often years may elapse before health becomes so firm as to resist 
ordinary imprudences of diet. The tendency of these diseases to 
return is constant, and no soldier, however well-recovered he may 
seem, is as strong a man in the ftiture. 

EXTRACTS FROM COMMUNICATIONS BY MEDICAL OFFICERS RESPECT- 
ING DIARRHCEA AND DYSENTERY. 

There is a good deal of evidence to show that chronic diarrhoea 
Intermittent oftcu assumcs a truly intermittent type, and becomes then 
cur:^hoea. amenable to the influence of quinine. This periodicity 
should be carefully distinguished from that diurnal exacerbation 
already mentioned, in which the tormina and discharges come on 
with violence at an early hour in the day, subsiding after noon, and 
ceasing almost altogether during the evenuig and most of the night. 
This daily intermission seems to have its origin only in the hours 
of food and sleep, and was never relieved by quinine. The inter- 
mittent diarrhoea of which a number of our contributors speak, has 
evidently another causation, and is rapidly benefited by the exhi- 
bition of quinine. 



DR. HOWARD'S COMMUKI CATION. SOT 

Of this class of cases Surgeon B. Howard says, in speaking of 
the sanitary condition of the army after the battle of Antietam, 
September, 1862 : — 

" About the 24th, amongst our own men, diarrhoea became very 
prevalent. As I was at that time acting Medical Purveyor ^J^^^^^^/^"™ 
of the army, I was being applied to every hour for opiates "°^^^y '^"'^- 
and astringents, which it had been impossible for me to Howard. 
obtain. From careful inquiry of the various surgeons who visited 
me, I found that the diarrhoea was, in most cases, better one day, and 
worse the next, the alternations occurring in much the same order as 
the paroxysm and intermission of intermittent fever. 

"At my suggestion, several surgeons, in lieu of the astringents which I 
was unable to furnish, administered sulphate of quinine, and proceeded 
to treat their patients as for intermittent fever. 

" In a few days I was greatly pleased to find some of them returning 
to report that its effect had been as prompt and decided as in intermit- 
tent fever. I then took occasion to inquire of the people in that region, 
and found that this form of diarrhoea was by no means uncommon 
there. 

" An old physician, who had practiced for twenty years in the village 
of Sharpsburgh, told me he had found it most common on the lower 
grounds, and in parts where malaria most prevailed ; that he had treated 
some cases of diarrhoea in those parts of the country which would yield 
to none of the usual remedies, and could be controlled only by quinine. 

" The occurrence of this diarrhoea I attributed to the sudden change 
of temperature to which the surface of the body, in these men, was so 
suddenly subjected, — the direct rays of a very hot sun, and the cold 
night dews succeeding each other rapidly, — while, in many cases, the 
protection which even a blanket could furnish, was not available to 
modify the effect of this sudden transition. 

" The apparently specific character of the diarrhoea I attributed to the 
present and previous exposure to malarial influences ; the diarrhoea, 
occurring in a system surcharged with malaria, taking on the type deter- 
mined by the dominant morbific agent then operating within the sys- 
tem. 

" The diarrhoea would, I supposed, disappear by the removal of its 
immediate causes in most cases, the specific disease remaining ; while 
control of the dominant morbific tendency would, as the greater includes 
the less, modify the diarrhoea accordingly. 

" This idea was afterwards corroborated, in some degree, by the old 
physician previously mentioned, who informed me of cases in which, the 
diarrhoea responding to treatment directed solely to it, chills and fever 
would set in, by interchange ; but if the treatment was vigorously and 
mainly addressed to the chills and fever, both these and the diarrhoea, 
as symptoms of a common cause, would gradually cease." 



308 COMMUNICATION BY SUKGEON WOODWARD. 

In the same connection Dr. Howard says : — 

" I have been informed by Dr. S. F. Elliott, Surgeon of Volunteers, 
in charge of General Hospital, St. Helena, N. C, that in the autumn 
of 1863, there were in the hospital about four hundred patients. 

" About one fourth of the whole number were affected with intermit- 
tent diarrhoea ; they would have diarrhoea for about a week, when this 
would suddenly cease, and immediately the patient would be attacked 
with a chill and the usual symptoms of intermittent fever ; or, in some 
cases, instead of intermittent, the fever would be of a remittent type. 
This would continue about a week, and then the diarrhoea would be 
substituted, constant alternation being kept up until the disease was 
eradicated. 

" The treatment was principally quinine, the diarrhoea being treated, 
for the relief of immediate symptoms, by astringents." 

Surgeon B. Woodward, in speakuig of an epidemic of chronic 
diarrhoea occurring at Cairo, 111., on the peculiarly malarial penin- 
sula at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi, in August and 
September, 1861, after describing the usual symptoms of the mal- 
ady, says : — 

" The character of the dejections and other symptoms showed hepatic

tion by Sur- Thcsc nearly all complamed of " fullness and pam m the re- 
Woodward. giou of the Hvcr. Endeavoring to analyze these cases, I was 
convinced that, though the abdomen was flaccid, there was congestion 
of the liver and portal vessels, and to relieve this resorted to Tripler's 
method with salines. This relieved the " fullness," evidently by deplet- 
ing the engorged vessels. As soon as this was obtained, they were put 
on R. Quinia Bi., Hyd. C. Cret. grs. xii., Opii grs. iij., in Chart. No. iv., 
one every three hours ; this arrested the paroxysms of fever. The evac- 
uations now generally became fecal, and a tonic and antiperiodic treat- 
ment soon completed the cure. Attention was paid to the diet, which 
was nourishing and bland. In those cases where there Avas less evi- 
dence of congestion of the portal circulation, the salines were not used, 
but quinia, ginger, cret. preparata, and iron by hydrogen, were used. 
My experience with opium, in either large or repeated doses, has not 
been satisfactory unless the liver was too active. The action of gallic 
acid has been better than that of tannin. I have been thus prolix for 
the reason that, wherever malarial diarrhoea has prevailed, the same 
treatment, substantially, has been satisfactory. In malarial regions we 
always found the prevalence of wet, or even damp weather, aggravated 
the disease, and made it far more prevalent. I believe that the Sibley 
tents, then in common use, in which the men were crowded close to the 
ground, and which could not be well ventilated, caused malarial diar- 
rhoeas that would have been avoided by a more rational method of shel-

tering the men. Malarial diarrhoea has often prevailed when its true 
character was unsuspected, except by those of large experience ; but 
a history of the antecedents of the men, with a knowledge of the local- 
ities from which they came, revealed the true region of the malady." 

Surgeon Edward Batwell, 14th Michigan Infantry, says : — 

" This condition was very observable when our troops lay before 
Savannah previous to its evacuation. The men were en- Extract from

-camped in the immediate vicinity of a swamp ; all the sur- tion by Sur- 
roundings presented the most favorable exciting causes for weii. 
malarious disease. There was an air of lassitude and weariness about 
every person — a desire of lying down. Every one you met was 
yawning, and complaining of pains in the limbs, back, or head. The 
bowels were irregular, the urine was very high-colored, and yet this 
chain of symptoms did not produce any febrile excitement, or induce 
the men to apply for medical aid — saying " they were only tired from 
the long march." A dose of blue pill and quinine relieved those who 
did seek assistance, and change of camp from within the fortifications 
to the high land about the city afforded relief to all. The fact was very 
observable all through the Atlantic campaign." 

While before Savannah : — 

"As soon as the swamps (the outlet to which had been dammed by 
the Rebels) were drained off, dysentery of a most fatal form became 
prevalent amongst the soldiers. Its onset was of a decided mala- 
rial character, and quinine speedily removed its periodicity, but exer- 
cised no beneficial influence over the graver part of the disease; 
indeed, no remedy seemed to check the dysenteric symptoms, which 
invariably proceeded, despite the utmost exertions, to a fatal result. 
Out of fifty-three cases recorded on the register of the hospital of the 
Second Division 1 4th Army Corps, but four recovered ; and this was 
the experience of other divisions of the same corps. Water was in my 
opinion the prolific source of the mischief, the larger proportion of the 
troops of this corps getting all their supply from the canal, or from 
mere surface wells in its immediate neighborhood." 

Surgeon George C. Ewing, 115tli Pennsylvania Volunteers, 
says : — 

" I have seen cases of diarrhoea which, in my opinion, were caused 
and kept up by malarial influence. I found that this diar- statement 
rhoea was decidedly benefited, and many cases cured, by Ewing. 
quinia, when the ordinary remedies totally failed even to give relief." 

From the above and concurrent testimony, it is evident that 
camp diarrhoea, aside from its obvious special causes, is conclusions 
amenable to the general morbific influences of malarial 3riii"^ 
regions, and that its treatment may be considerably mod- "^*i"«°™^-

ified for tliat reason. The malarial poison may appear, first, in a 
regular or irregular periodicity of the diarrhoeal attack ; or, second, 
as an addition to the general malady, not obviously affecting or 
affected by it, and its cure having little influence upon the flux 
itself. 

In the Keport of the Surgeon-General of Ohio for 1863, Dr. 
Report by Salisbury communicates a paper, attributing to a starch 
bury^Dn diet the peculiar prevalence of chronic diarrhoea, and 
surch(Met. asscrtiug in effect, that the flatulence attending it was 
but a chemical development of carbonic acid gas from the fer- 
mentation of starches within the alimentary system; that yeast 
plants were found in large numbers in the stools ; and that, to- 
ward death, the so-called apthse often appearing in the mouth and 
pharynx were true cerevisiae. The subject of the excess of starches 
is elsewhere discussed in these volumes. We have only to append 
the little we have which can be construed as bearing upon the 
microscopic phenomena attending the diarrhoea of camps. 

Surgeon Benjamin Woodward says : — 

" In reports made at various times, I have stated that ' microscopic 
Surgeon cryptogami had not only been detected on faeces exposed to 
repOTts 0? ^ the air, but also on the mucous coat of the intestines.' These 
agency of examinations were made at various times and places, and 

cryptoga- ' 

mia. with all the care possible — not to establish a theory, but to 

ascertain the cause of the disease. I inclose the original drawings of 
these organisms, which I had sent home. Having no camera lucida, they 
were made as accurately as possible by the eye. In every case they 
had the form of the common prickly pear {Cactus opuntia). On faeces 
which had lain on damp shaded ground, in warm weather, they have 
been abundant ; but the direct rays of the sun seem either to destroy 
them or prevent their formation. I have generally found them among 
weeds and bushes, or other shaded places. I never could detect any 
spores ; but it has been noticeable that in camps situated where there 
was not thorough ventilation — especially in damp, warm weather — 
the disease was most common and virulent ; and that in those camps 
most neglected in their police it was far more common than in those 
whose police was good. During the spring of 1863, while the army 
under General Rosecrans lay at Murfreesboro', those regiments that 
occupied low ground between hills or strips of timber-land suffered 
much more than those in better ventilated situations. 

" The 22d Illinois Infantry were encamped to the southeast of the 
16th Missouri, which was notorious for its bad police and the prev- 
alence of diarrhoea ; and the left flank of the 2 2d, which rested on the 
right of the 16th, suffered from diarrhoea much more than the right, 



DEFECTIVE CAMP POLICE. 311 

which rested on the 42d Illinois Volunteers, whose surgeon, Dr. Han- 
son, was thorough in his camp police. I was at that time Division 
Inspector, and was led to mark the differences in the health of regi- 
ments, and it was always found that the 42d and 27th Illinois, whose 
police was rigid, had the least sickness of any in the division. In those 
regiments where the sinks and latrines were well constructed and cov- 
ered, the cases of this form of diarrhoea were rare. An Indiana and 
Missouri battery were encamped on the shores of Stone River, about 
half a mile apart. The localities were alike ; but in the case of the 
Indiana battery the grounds were covered with filth, and diarrhoea was 
terribly prevalent ; while the Missouri battery, whose grounds were kept 
as clean as a door yard, enjoyed the best of health. It was found 
necessary to report the Indiana battery to General P. Sheridan, who 
commanded the division, and he put the battery under the charge of a 
young assistant-surgeon, Dr. Elliott, who, by his thorough police and 
general hygienic arrangements, soon made it as healthy as any in the 
command. 

" The conclusions at which I have arrived are, that camp diarrhoea is 
caused by cryptogamic formations generated in camps and barracks, 
and disseminated in the air; and that good and absolutely perfect 
police will insure against this form of disease." 

No special causation of camp diarrhoea is more strongly insisted 
upon than the defective police of camps and their envi- Defective 
rons. JN o surgeon questions the evil etrects or this cause, camps, 
though some fail to insist upon it as decidedly as others. The idea 
is as old as the Mosaic police of the camps of Israel, and there is 
abundant evidence that moving columns of troops, which make a 
new camp every evening, and thus escape the filth of older camps, 
are much more free from diarrhoea than permanent cantonments, 
however well policed. Upon this point and sundry other condi- 
tions of causation, prevention, and cure, we append the folio whig 
testimony. 

Surgeon Norman Gay, U. S. Volunteers, offers the following 
practical suggestions : — 

''Among all the causes of sickness in the armies, particularly diar- 
rhoea, badly constructed sinks for the men, and pits for suggestions 
kitchen slops and garbage are the greatest. I have no hesi- gI/^oT'*'' 
tation in saying that one half of the diarrhoea in the armies ''^"'^ p"^'*"®" 
of the United States was caused by miasm, from the fecal matter, 
kitchen slops, and garbage deposited in and around their camps. I 
will give one case which will illustrate, and is but one of many that 
came under my notice while on duty with troops in the field. In the 
winter of 1863-64, while in charge of the left wing, 16th Army Corps, 
on receiving the reports of sick and wounded, for the month of De- 



312 TESTIMONY OF SURGEON GAY. 

cember, one of the regiments reported sixty-eight cases of diarrhoea, with 
three deaths ; while the other regiments reported only from six to seven 
cases, and no deaths. Knowing that the command were all in good lo- 
cations, and fed Avith the same food, I immediately visited the regiment, 
and, on inspection, I found the grounds between the tents in fair con- 
dition. They had three sinks, which had been used a little, but left 
without filling in dirt from time to time, or having their sides policed as 
is required. 

" The men preferring to go to the surrounding bushes near the camp 
to using the sinks, it was permitted by the colonel commanding. As the 
regiment had been some five weeks in camp, one who is acquainted 
with duties in the field with troops, can form a correct idea of the sur- 
rounding fields and bushes. For from one to two hundred yards on 
three sides of the camp, the grounds were covered with fecal matter, 
the odor from which pervaded the entire camp. The grounds were 
ordered to be policed, fecal matter buried, sinks properly made, and 
a guard put on to compel every man to use them. 

"At the end of four days, the sick report, which was mostly diar- 
rhoeal, was reduced three fourths, and at the end of a week the disease 
disappeared — a disease from which three had died, and quite a large 
number disabled for the summer campaign ; a disease depending en- 
tirely on the miasm from the surrounding filth. 

" The old plan of digging a trench fifteen or twenty feet long, from 
two to three feet deep and wide, leaving it open at the top, exposing 
the deposits to the hot sun and rains, then inclosing with bushes, which 
prevent the escape of the miasm, with, in addition, the frequent neg- 
lect of filling in dirt or policing the sides, makes one of the most dis- 
gusting places a man could well find, and, I believe, one of the great 
foci of disease in our army's encounter. Not unfrequently a shower of 
rain fills up the trench, and flows its contents over the surrounding 
grounds. This cannot be corrected when it occurs, and the camps 
suffer. The men have to spend more or less time breathing the poison 
of these places, or go to the ravines and bushes surrounding the camp, 
which soon infects the entire neighborhood. 

" The following is a plan of sink which can be constructed at almost 
any camp, and which corrects most, if not all, the defects of those for- 
merly in use. Dig a vault ten feet long and eight feet wide, and from 
six to fifteen feet deep, as the nature of the ground will admit ; put a 
log or timber on either side of the vault, resting their ends on the earth 
at either end of the vault. The log should be dropped a little below 
the surface. Cover the vault with rails or planks, except the centre, 
where you will have a chimney or ventilator from fifteen to twenty feet 
high. The bench or pole is placed on the outside of the log by dig- 
ging a slide, so that the fecal matter shall slide under the log into the^ 
wault. The vault should be covered with dirt sufficient to keep out the 




TESTIMONY OF SURGEONS. 313 

heat of the sun and prevent the gas from escaping, except through the 
chimney. The space between the logs will act as a chamber, into which 
the gases rise and pass off through the ventilator. Sinks built in this 
way will last for weeks or months and not be offensive. 

" The best plan for kitchen sink or pits is the following : Dig a vault 
from six to seven feet square, and from six to twelve feet deep. Cover 
with rails or planks, except a place for a barrel with both heads out, 
through which to pass the slops and garbage into the vault. The barrel 
should have a cover, to be taken off only when pouring in slops. The 
dirt thrown around the barrel prevents all escape of gas or unpleasant 
odor, and furnishes no support for flies, which are so troublesome in 
camps. The plan of hauling off the slops was adopted by many regi- 
ments, but from my experience I would not advise it. The place where 
the barrel sets is always more or less filthy from overfilling and other 
accidents so frequently, that it is usually a nuisance in the camp and a 
harbor for insects. The theory of hauling off is good, but it does not 
work in practice, from the frequent neglect and carelessness of the 
men." 

Surgeon B. Woodward says : — 

" A great natural law or instinct teaches all carnivora to cover their 
ordure with earth ; even the domestic dog and cat do this im- Remarks by 
perfectly, while the whole of the feline and canine races, in Woodward. 
the wild state, do it perfectly. There is a recognition of this as a law 
of health in the Levitical code, which insisted that every one ' should 
have a paddle on his weapon.' No fact is better estabHshed than that 
even large bodies of men travelling even in great emigration parties, 
are never troubled with this form of diarrhoea, for the reason that they 
do not remain long enough to be affected by the forming fungi. A pre- 
ventive is well constructed and often policed sinks, with earth enough 
each day thrown in to cover thoroughly all the fecal matter. The disease 
has generally manifested itself in home camps, where the care of police 
was imperfectly understood, and still less perfectly enforced than in the 
camps in actual service. It is not at all improbable that the disease 
once generated may be propagated through breathing the air infected 
from the lungs of diseased men." 

Surgeon M. D. Benedict, 75th New York Volunteers, in a his- 
tory of his regiment, ascribes diarrhoea rather to excesses of diet. 
The command landed at Fort Pickens, Dec. 14-15, 1861, weather 
warm and pleasant. He says : — 

" We had very soon a full supply of fresh beef, salt beef. Surgeon

aniim, without tenesmus or other symptoms of irritation or inflammation. 
Only a few more escaped entirely an attack of the disease, and these, in 
every case, were men of frugal and abstemious habits, who did not con- 
sume more than one third to one half of their rations. 

" During the latter half of the month of January, 1862, a cargo of 
fruit arrived from Havana, consisting of oranges, lemons, limes, ba- 
nanas, and pine-apples. These were furnished the men in great abun- 
dance, and during the time they were plenty, but a small proportion of 
ordinary food was consumed, the company and regimental funds being 
largely increased by savings on rations. Under this fruit-diet the cases 
of diarrhoea disappeared with remarkably celerity. Upon the exhaus- 
tion of the fruit, the diarrhoea returned, but was less general and not so 
severe." 

Surgeon Edward Batwell attributes much importance to the 
condition of the nervous system. He says : — 

" Whilst the army of Buell followed Morgan into and through Ken- 
Surgeon tucky, and back after the battle of Perryville to Tennessee, 
?d[aUons*of ^^^Y ^'^^^^ camp diarrhoea made its appearance, and that, too, 
diarrhoea to ^hcu the troops wcrc ucw and unacclimated ; but as soon as 
system. they encamped around Nashville, they began to suffer dread- 

fully. So many solutions have been offered to explain the cause of 
diarrhoea amongst soldiers, that we find it impossible to give preference 
to any, believing, as we do, that the same cause does not always produce 
the same effect. Why is it that some have diarrhoea, and others are 
constipated, whilst under the same exciting cause ? Does it arise from 
an overloaded state of the intestines, or from badly cooked or unwhole- 
some rations ? But the only solution we ever endeavored to thoroughly 
investigate, was that of considering the great influence exerted over the 
disease by the nervous system. Any one who has ever suffered from camp 
diarrhoea, can testify to the sense of utter prostration and listless indif- 
ference experienced, and that, too, before it could have been induced by 
debility. I have asked very many surgeons, relative to the nervous con- 
dition of patients laboring under chronic diarrhoea. The invariable an- 
swer was, that the cases were chiefly amongst those of an extremely 
nervous disposition. Again, it was observed that the disease prevailed 
more particularly amongst men and companies raised in the country, — 
those who always had the care of mothers and sisters, and the comforts of 
a well-regulated home, — whilst the ' Roughs ' brought up in towns and 
cities, who did not appreciate home (if they had one), nor had ever 
experienced care or attention in their moments of illness, were almost 
exempt from disease of this sort. Who has not observed the effect pro- 
duced on the former, even if almost ' moribund,' when told they would 
be permitted to return on furlough to their homes ? And who has not 
seen those same men return to their regiments strong, hale, and healthy, 



REMARKS BY SURGEONS. 315 

after being a short time at home ? The policy adopted by military au- 
thorities relative to not allowing men to go (under proper authority) 
to their family during illness, produced more deaths, and was more de- 
structive of human life in the army, than the much-spoken-of and atro- 
cious treatment of our brave and heroic brothers, in the prison pens of 
Macon or Andersonville. Better that a large number of ' malingerers ' 
should be guilty of the crime of going to their homes for a short time, 
than that the thousands whose death stands on our hospital records, as 
resulting from ' chronic diarrhoea,' should be permitted to pine and wish 
and die for a brief but life-saving furlough." 

Surgeon P. H. Bailhache says : —

bad quality ; overloading the stomach with green fruit and other indi- 
gestible matter ; indulging in large draughts of water while over-heated ; 
resting upon the damp ground or in the heat of the sun while upon the 
march ; in many cases debauchery and intemperance whenever oppor- 
tunity presents itself, — all these are fruitful causes of the diseases 
of the digestive organs and alimentary canal, which are manifested by 
acute diarrhoeas and dysenteries. If not arrested by the ordinary means 
of oil and astringents, these diseases soon assume a chronic character 
(subacute inflammation of the mucous membrane of stomach and bow- 
els), and they are difficult to control, particularly in the field where the 
exciting causes continue to exist." 

Surgeon C. C. Jewett, after alluding to the ordinary causa- 
tions, says : — 

" One or two of these causes, from their peculiarity to the life under 
consideration, and their frequency of action, require a little Remarks by 
notice. No causes in army life, excepting in some localities Jewett. 
miasmata, more frequently operate in the production of chronic diar- 
rhoea than improper food and the gaseous exhalations of animal decay. 
Improper food includes the want of variety and too great concentration 
of the ration as perhaps necessarily furnished on an active campaign, 
and the short allowance engendered by the deliberate reductions of the 
same by the soldiers themselves, by throwing away a portion before 
starting on a march or an improvident use during the first few days after 
filling the haversack, but also unwholesome articles obtained from sut- 
lers, and what is a frequent peccant article, the beef of cattle too recently 
killed, the consumption of which it is impossible always to prevent in

the hurried march of troops. The most frequent sources of suffering 
from animal putrescence are found in the vicinity of places where beeves 
are slaughtered, in contiguity to battle-fields, and on the reoccupation of 
old camps. The pestiferous air from the battle-field of Fair Oaks caused 
more deaths from diarrhoea among the troops camped in and about it, 
than did the bullets of the enemy to those engaged, and the 120th New 
York and 11th New Jersey regiments have a sad record of deaths from 
occupying old camps. 

" The effects of proper hygienic measures were very marked in ward- 
ing off or moderating this disease. Those regiments, as far as my 
observation goes, were most free from it that were best officered, and 
who had in consequence well selected camps ; where the sun had free 
access, the water was sweet, and the prevailing Avinds blew over them 
from no sources of putrefaction or swampy tracts (advantages which 
can be often seized) ; where the policing was thorough — latrines, each 
day filled in with two or three inches of fresh earth, whose drainage 
was good, where slops and refuse were not allowed to be thrown — and 
where the tents were daily thrown open for ventilation. Such regi- 
ments had more comfortable quarters, fuller and more properly cooked 
supplies, were warmly clothed, were depressed in fewer instances by dis- 
content and other passions arising from want of confidence in superiors, 
and enjoyed in consequence of all better health." 

Surgeon R. A. Dvy^yer, 175tli Ohio Infantry, attributes diarrhoea 
to hard bread especially. He says : — 

" I have seen hard bread give rise to more chronic diarrhoea than all 
Surgeon Other causes combined. I have seen it occur under a great 
agency of Variety of circumstances, and at all seasons of the year, in the 
hard bread. y^Heys and ou the mouutaius, and I am fully convinced that 
hard bread was the cause. I have seen it disappear when soft bread 
was issued, and suddenly reappear when hard bread was issued. Hard 
bread usually causes a constipated condition of the bowels for a few 
days, during which time a fermentation takes place, with a gaseous dis- 
tention of the bowels, and a yeasty diarrhoea sets in. The food taken 
during the day ferments by evening, and the diarrhoea is worse at night 
or early in the morning. The bowels become more irritable as the dis- 
ease progresses, and the passages are more frequent. The fermenting 
process seems to increase, and all the food taken — no matter what the 
quality or kind — seems to be subject to the same process as long as 
hard bread is used, and very frequently continues after a change of diet, 
and chronic diarrhoea is formed. I have seen a number of cases get 
apparently well, and an ability to digest hard bread was apparently 
acquired, but I always observed that those men were very liable to a 
recurrence of the disease from very slight causes." 



REPORT OF SURGEON STEVENSON 



FRESH MUTTON CAUSING GENERAL DIARRHCEA IN THE SIXTH NEW 

YORK ARTILLERY, COL. J. B. KITCHING. REPORTED BY PROF. C. A. 

LEE. 

This regiment, when encamped in the Shenandoah Valley, at Front 
Royal, in the summer of 1864, and living chiefly on hard biscuit and 
salt pork, were supplied with several hundred sheep, which were slaugh- 
tered and dressed about four o'clock in the afternoon. Between five 
and six o'clock the men all ate heartily of the mutton, which was cooked 
while the meat was still warm. 

"At eight o'clock the same evening, the regiment took up its march 
for Middletown. About three hours after commencing the march, the 
men began to fall out of the ranks, being attacked with sudden and 
violent diarrhoea. In the course of an hour, every man in the regiment, 
including the officers, was attacked in a similar manner. The disease 
was of but a few hours' duration, as the regiment, on the next day, 
returned to their usual rations of hard tack and salt meats, with occa- 
sional vegetables — as potatoes. No serious results followed the attacks, 
although the strength of the men was considerably reduced in conse- 
quence of the copious alvine discharges." 

Surgeon B. F. Stevenson reports as follows: — 

" The first morbid link in the chain of predisposing causes to chronic 
diarrhoea I have thought to be an interference with the Repoi"tof

healthy functions of the skin. The intimate relations subsist- Stevenson. 
inof between the integument and the mucous tissues are well under- 
stood, and the certainty with which we may prognosticate disturbance 
of the pulmonary and intestinal mucous membranes from a suddenly 
repelled cutaneous discharge, is equally well understood. 

" Soldiers, as a general rule, neglect the functions of the skin more 
than those of any other organ. They sleep under less covering than 
before entering the service ; they do not attend to ablutions of the 
surface, and the transpiratory pores become obstructed. On picket- 
duty they are frequently restrained from any exercise, and at night, 
even in warm seasons of the year, the surface becomes chilled, and in 
winter benumbed and paralyzed with cold. These causes combined con- 
stringe the capillaries and give a centripetal direction to the fluids of 
the body. When the functions of one organ have been interfered with, 
it is a law of the animal economy that some other organ shall do vica- 
rious duty, and the weaker one for the moment is called to do double 
duty, and this call to extra duty generally finds the bowels in the 
condition to respond to the call. The ration furnished the army has 
of necessity to be concentrated food. The hard bread, the pork, and 
beef contain, in a given bulk, more nutriment than the same bulk where 
succulent green vegetables are used, and the soldier but too frequently 
permits his eyes to govern his appetite. He bolts his bulk of bread

and pork unmasticated, and his digestive organs, already predisposed to 
disease from the amount of duty thrown on them from a repelled cu- 
taneous transpiration, revolt, overtasked, and lapse into a state of pas- 
sive looseness, which runs into subacute inflammation, and which, 
' growing by that it feeds on,' but too often ends in ulceration, disorgan- 
ization, and death." 

The discrepancies in the above opinions are more apparent than 
Explanation real. Nothing is more obvious than that all diseases are 
discrepan- subject to the influence of climate, diet, and habits of 
opinion. life. To this rule chronic diarrhoea is no exception, and 
the frequency and fatality it exhibits in armies is due rather to the 
combination of several causes, than to the prevalence of any one. 
The most important causations are, doubtless, bad police of camps, 
defective diet, and exposure to rapid radiation of the animal heat. 

Enough has been quoted to show how controllable these ele- 
ments may become in a well-organized army, and the sanitary 
lessons taught by the stern exj)erience of the late war are not 
likely to be lost in any future conflict.

During the winter and spring of 1864, six regiments of colored 
troops were recruited at Benton Barracks. Pneumonia made its 
appearance among these troops about Christmas, and continued 
with undiminished severity until the last of April, when it suddenly 
abated. 

From January 1st to May 1st, seven hundred and eighty-four 
cases of pneumonia were treated in the hospital, of which Number of 
one hundred and fifty-six died. Besides the above there deaths, and 
were six hundred and seventy-five cases of measles treated the di.sease. 
in the hospital, of which one hundred and thirty died, death being 
caused mainly by pneumonia or other pulmonary complications. 
The pneumonia presented well-marked varieties with symptoms

peculiar to each. These varieties I have designated as congestive, 
typhoid, and pleuro-pneumonia. 

During the month of January, when cold and exposure operated

January. ^|jq climate and the inclemency of the weather exert a 
powerful agency in producing this disease and aggravating its se- 
verity, is most evident. 

The winter of 1864 was unparalleled for severe cold weather in 
Severity of ^^^ viciuity of St. Louis, the like of which had never

inhabitant." All who carefully watched the progress of the dis- 
ease noticed that a few warm days lessened very much the fre- 
quency, and diminished the severity, of cases among the soldiers 
in the barracks. It was also observed in the hospital that when 
the weather was very cold and disagreeable, and when we were 
deprived of suitable ftiel, as we unfortunately were during the 
coldest of the weather, the symptoms became very much aggra- 
vated, and the number of deaths were greatly increased. The 
sudden abatement of the disease in the latter part of April and 
early in May was undoubtedly due to the warm and pleasant 
weather which began to prevail at that time. 

I. CONGESTIVE FORM. 

The patient, after suffering for several days with catarrhal symp- 
Symptomsia ^oms, attended with more or less mental stupidity or in- 
this form. difference, was suddenly taken with a severe chill very- 
similar to that accompanying pernicious fever ; the surface cold, 
and the pulse either very small and feeble or imperceptible ; the 
respirations short, frequent, and oppressed ; great prostration, with 
severe pain in the head, back, and limbs. This state of depression 
continued from twelve to forty-eight hours, when either reaction 
took place, or death closed the scene. When the patient survived 
the chill, and reaction became fully established, a fever of a low 
asthenic form ensued, attended with a feeble arterial and imper- 
fect capillary circvdation ; frequent cough ; expectoration at first 
of frothy mucus, viscid and streaked with blood, but soon becoming 
muco-purulent, copious in quantity, amounting in many cases to 
from one to two pints in twenty-four hours. Few cases exhibited 
the rusty colored or brick-dust sputa, common to the ordinary forms 
of pneumonia. Pain, in some cases, continued after reaction, and 
was severe in the head and chest ; in other cases it was wholly

absent ; the mind was generally stupid or dull, but occasionally 
there was boisterous delirium. This form of the disease usually 
ran its course very rapidly to a fatal termination. Coma, as a rule, 
preceded death. 

Physical examinations of the chest, in the severe congestive 
form, showed often that both hmgs were attacked, p^^y^^^^^ 
There was marked dullness on percussion, sometimes cSgVs°ive 
confined to a distinct portion of each lung, at others "'^''*'^- 
extending; over the whole of one side of the chest. In a few 
cases in the early stage auscultation revealed fine crepitation in 
some portion of the affected lung ; but in general this sign was 
either absent or existed but transiently. Bronchial respiration 
and mucous rales were frequently present. 

Whenever there were well-marked physical signs of hepatization 
the chlorides were invariably found to be absent in the chlorides in 
urine when tested for by nitric acid and the nitrate of sil- ^^^ """*' 
ver. A return of the chlorides was observed when resolution of 
the hepatized lung was fully established. This form of pneumonia 
was almost invariably fatal. 

II. TYPHOID PNEUMONIA. 

This variety was usually ushered in without a severe chill. 
From the first the disease assumed a typhoid type, and symptoms of 
was more protracted before death or recovery than in the *^^® ^°^"^' 
preceding variety. This form was remarkable for the freedom 
fi'om pain of the patient, and, were it not for the physical signs 
and increased frequency of respirations, pneumonia would hardly 
have been suspected. The tongue was usually brown, with red 
edges, and sometimes dry and cracked ; teeth covered with sordes, 
and the mouth filled with a tough, tenaceous mucus ; the pulse, 
always feeble and diminished in volume, varied much in frequency 
in different cases, and in the same case at different times, varying 
from sixty to one hundred and fifty per minute. The expectora- 
tion was sometimes scanty, and at other times copious ; at first it 
consisted of viscid mucus, but it soon became muco or sero-puru- 
lent, with a fetid and disagreeable odor. The cough was usually 
not severe nor frequent. 

Percussion revealed dullness over the affected portion or portions 
of lung. Auscultation seldom or never showed fine crep- physical 
itation, but thei?e was fi-equently a mucous or subcrepitant f^^^^^

gressed with great rapidity, and there was a corresponding loss of 
strength. A dark jaundiced appearance of the sclerotic coat of 
the eye was frequently observed. 

III. PLEURO-PNEUMONIA. 

Pleuritis, with copious effusion of serum and lymph into the 
Symptoms in Pleural cavity, was a frequent complication in cases of 
tiusform. ^jjg above variety. The post-mortem examinations re- 
vealed the existence of this complication in sixty-four out of one 
hundred and fifty cases. A marked peculiarity of the variety 
which I have distinguished as pleuro-pneumonia was the frequent 
absence of pain in the pleura during the stage of active inflamma- 
tion, and had it not been for the physical signs the disease would 
not have been suspected. Occasionally cases occurred in which 
the pain was severe. Relapses, in this form of the disease, were 
frequent and fatal. Patients who had become convalescent, and to 
all appearances in a fair way to recover, became suddenly worse 
upon slight exposure, improper indulgence, or change of weather ; 
a severe chill occurred, followed by great prostration of strength, 
copious effusion into the pleural cavity, and speedy dissolution. 

In every variety of pneumonia, the physical signs were of the 
utmost importance in determining the extent and charac-

of the lungs. 

I would here remark that I watched the progress of this disease 
with much interest and care. Autopsies were frequently made, 
and the morbid appearances carefully noted. I have endeavored 
to ascertain, as far as practicable, the causes that operated in pro- 
ducing the disease, and the most effectual mode of combating it.

tioned.^ One hundred men were crowded into rooms originally 
meant but for fifty, necessarily rendering the air very impure ; 
and this evil was rendered greater by the faulty construction of 
the barracks and imperfect ventilation. The effect of an epidemic 
influence is showTi by the fact that physicians and nurses, who had 
not been greatly exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather and the 
other causes mentioned, have suffered from it. Besides, the sur- 
geons on duty with the regiments in the barracks report that men

DIFFERENCES FOUND AFTER DEATH. 323 

occupying the same bunks with those affected were very much 
more Hable to be attacked than those more remote. Some of the 
most intelligent surgeons were led to beheve that the disease was 
actually contagious. 

A very large proportion of the cases of measles treated in the 
hospitals had pulmonary complications. More than fifty Occurrence 
per cent, of the well-marked cases of pneumonia follow- measles, 
ing measles proved fatal. This liability did not seem to depend 
upon the severity of the primary disease. Frequently, two or 
three days after convalescence had been fully established, patients 
,who were able to walk about the wards, and having a good appe- 
'tite, suffering only with slight catarrhal symptoms, were attacked 
with a chill, sometimes slight, at others severe, followed by fever, 
pain in the chest, head, limbs, and back, oppressed respiration, fre- 
quent or almost continuous cough ; the pulse usually small and 
frequent. The expectoration, at first muco-sanguineous, soon be- 
came sero-purulent and copious in quantity; the disease ran its 
course rapidly to a fatal termination, or eventuated in a slow and 
tardy convalescence. Post-mortem examinations usually Dififerences 
showed a marked difference in the morbid appearances death iu

of pneumonia produced by other causes. Hepatization was less 
marked : the luno; tissue was oftener oedematous or filled with a 
sero-sanguineous fluid, and contained a sufficient quantity of air to 
make it float on water ; when pressed between the fingers,' a large 
quantity of bloody serum exuded.^ 

I am satisfied that the lung frequently passed from this oedema- 
tous condition, without passing through the stages of red and gray 
hepatization, into that of purulent infiltration. The mucous mem- 
branes of the large bronchial tubes were always found greatly in- 
flamed and softened ; and it is believed that frequently death 
resulted in consequence of capillary bronchitis. 

The following tables have been prepared with special Account of 
regard to accuracy : — ^^"^ **^^^^' 

Table I. embraces one hundred fatal cases of pneumonia, show- 
ing the number of days sick in hospital ; the lungs, one or 
both attacked ; the stage of the disease of each lung at the time 
of death, whether congestion, red hepatization, gray hepatization, 
or purulent infiltration ; and the weight of the lungs. 

Table II. shows the day and number of deaths occurring on the 
same for one hundred cases. 

1 Much more than is usual in the stage of simple engorgement in the ordinary forms of 
pneumonia. The lung tissue was also much more softened and more easily broken down. 



324 ACCOUNT OF THE TABLES. 

Table III. contains the same facts as Table I. with reference to 
fifty cases of pleuro-pneumonia, giving in addition, the amount of 
effusion in the pleural cavity in each case. 

Table IV. shows the duration of the disease in fifty cases of 
pneumonia and thirty-eight cases of measles before death. 

Table V. embraces fifty cases of pneumonia occurring in Wil- 
son Hospital, Tennessee — among colored troops — not included 
in the foregoing tables, and shows the order in which the lungs and 
several lobes of the lungs were attacked, and the stage of the dis- 
ease in each lobe at the period of death, together with the weight 
of each lung. 

Table VI. shows the duration of the disease in fifty-three cases 
of measles recovering in January, and forty-five in February ; of 
sixty-two cases of pneumonia recovering in January, and fifty- 
seven recovering in February in hospital at Benton Barracks, 
Missouri.

Remarks. — This table shows the age, number of days sick, the lung affected, whether 
right or left, the stage of disease in each lung, whether Congestion, Red Hepatization, Gray 
Hepatization, or Purulent Infiltration, and weight of each lung. From which it appears that 
in all but one case both lungs were affected. The right lung was in the stage of Conges- 
tion, in 24 cases; of Red Hepatization, in 35 cases; of Gray Hepatization, in 29 cases; of 
Purulent Infiltration, in 15 cases. The left lung was in stage of Congestion, in 23 cases ; of 
Red Hepatization, in 34 cases; of Gray Hepatization, in 26 cases; of Purulent Infiltration, 
in 16 cases. The most advanced stage of the disease is taken in each lung. 

from the above, it appears that the average number of days sick is Hy^t-

It will be perceived by the above tables that there was great 
diversity in the length of time in which recovery took place, but it 
is believed that they give a very fair representation of all the cases 
of the kind referred to occurring in the hospital. In some the re- 
covery was very rapid ; in others very slow and protracted. 

TREATMENT. 

At first there was a diversity of opinion among the surgeons on

amoJiTsur- iTi^ut of the discasc. In a few instances bleeding, calo-

this plan of treatment was soon manifest, and a more general uni- 
formity of opinion respecting the asthenic type of the disease, and 
the importance of tonics and stimulants in its treatment were en- 
tertained. The agents most generally used were carbon- ^^^^^^ ^^^_ 
ate of ammonia, senega, quinine, capsicum, alcoholic *''''"y"sed. 
stimulants, and in the advanced stages iodide of potassium and the 
muriated tincture of iron, together with pretty free use of opiates 
to allay pain and cough. The tincture of veratmm viride and the 
tincture of sanguinaria were found useful in controlling vascular 
action. Stimulating pediluvia, sinapisms, wet and dry cups to the 
chest, and blisters in the advanced stages of the disease were 
found useful. Beef soup, milk punch, and nourishing diet were 
found to be of the utmost importance. Great care with faithftil 
watching by the surgeon was of especial importance in consequence 
of the frequent changes in the symptoms and condition of the 
patient, passing, as he not unfrequently did, in a few hours, from 
a state of high febrile excitement to one of great prostration. Dr. 
J. M. Martine, who spent most of his time in his ward, passing 
from patient to patient, careftilly noting the changes occurring, and 
meeting these changes by appropriate remedies, was very much 
more successful than other surgeons who gave less attention to 
their patients. 

The liability to sudden, rapid, and dangerous prostration was 
one of the most alarming features of the disease. The Liability to

found a patient doing apparently well, and at his evening visit 
found him dead. Dr. Martine, by his faithftil and constant attend- 
ance, and the free administration of stimulants during the period of 
prostration, saved in this condition many who probably otherAvise 
would have died. The quantity of brandy and whisky borne by 
patients under such circumstances was very great, amounting some- 
times to a quart a day.

quent indications. It is a valuable diffusible stimulant ; 
it affords a concentrated material for assimilation and nutrition; 
and it undoubtedly promotes the liquid state of the plastic material 
of the blood. 

I have given some attention to the use of quinine as a prophylac- 
tic prescribed in free doses during the period of malaise. Quinine as a

832 EFFICACY OF TREATMENT AMONG NEGROES. 

satisfied that it exerts a great and controlling influence in pre- 
venting the accession of the chill with which the disease is ushered 
in, affording pretty good evidence, in my opinion, that malaria is 
an element to be taken into the account in the treatment of this 
disease. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

The hospital at Benton Barracks afforded a good opportunity 
for observing the characteristics of this disease as it affected dif- 
ferent races and classes of persons. 

There were in the hospitals under my charge white and colored 
Classes of soldicrs, Contraband and white refugee women and chil- 
patients at ^Yeu. Pueumonia was prevalent among them all. The 
Barracks. attacks wcrc uot as frequent among the white soldiers, 
nor were they as fatal. Among the other classes mentioned little 
difference was observed, except the greater frequency of the disease, 
and greater mortality among the white refugees, consisting mostly 
of women, children, and old men from Arkansas, Louisiana, and 
West Tennessee. They were noted for their indolence, ignorance, 
filthiness, and inveterate consumption of tobacco. The women 
were particularly addicted to chewing, smoking, and dipping the 
pernicious weed. Among this class the disease was much more 
intractable and fatal than among the contrabands and colored 
soldiers. 

The greater liability of the negro race to pulmonary diseases 
Liability of than the white, is apparent when contrasted with the 
putoonlry'' wcll-to-do in the world of the latter race ; but when 
disease. contrasted with the poor whites, as seen in reftigee 
camps, the contrast is in favor of the negro. 

It is often said — even by surgeons in charge of colored regi- 
Efflcacy of Hieuts — that it is of no use to " doctor " a sick negro ; that 
Jasefamon^ he wiU dic, do what you may. I am satisfied that no 
negroes. greater mistake can be committed.^ When I hear a sur- 
geon making such a statement, I regard it as evidence of culpable 
indifference and neglect. Among no class of patients have I seen 
better results from treatment than among colored soldiers when 
proper care and study has been given to their disease. 

The great liability of the negro to inflammatory pulmonary dis- 

1 I had the care of seven hundred wounded negro soldiers after the battle at Nashville, 
and I never saw wounds do better — there was much less gangrene and pyajmia than 
among the wounded white soldiers. It is true, however, that the colored wounded were 
treated and retained near the battle-iield, while the white were transported first to Nash- 
ville and then to Louisville and further north. 



PREVALEKCE AKD FATALITY OF PNEUMONIA. 333 

ease is shown by the fact that in an equal number of autopsies 
of whites and negroes, a very much larger porportion of the latter 
are found to have old pleuritic adhesions than the former, pieuritic ad- 
The frequency of tuberculosis is not any greater in the S^j^^Vter 
negro than in the white race, if I may rely upon the evi- frTque'a"' 1^ 
dence furnished by several hundred post-mortem exam- "^^roes. 
inations of each race — a fact differing, I believe, from the com- 
monly received opinion upon that subject. 

I have found the weight of the healthy lungs in the negro to be 
on an average four ounces less than in the white man, weight of 
and I would suggest if this disparity in the size of the negroes. 
lungs may not have something to do with the inability of the 
negro to endure forced marches with equal facility with the white 
soldier, as has been frequently shown during the war. 

NOTE RESPECTING THE PREVALENCE AND FATALITY OF PNEUMONIA 
AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY 
SYSTEM, AMONG THE UNITED STATES TROOPS DURING THE WAR. 

Inflammatory diseases affecting the respiratory system enter 
largely into military as into civil practice. Dr. Woodward, in his 
report, contained in Circular No. 6, War Department, Surgeon- 
General's Office, Nov. 1st, 1865, states that the cases of inflam- 
matory affections of the respiratory system during the first two 
years of the war amounted to 304,254. Of these cases 8090 
proved fatal. Inflammatory affections of the air passages were 
the most numerous : the cases of catarrh, epidemic catarrh, together 
with acute and chronic bronchitis, amounted to 248,773 ; and in 
addition to these there were 8516 cases of laryngitis. The cases 
reported as pleurisy numbered 15,438. The number of cases of 
pneumonia reported during the first two years was 31,527. As 
regards fatality, the deaths from pneumonia exceeded greatly those 
from all the other inflammatory affections of the respiratory sys- 
tem : the deaths from the latter were 999 ; whereas, of the 31,527 
cases of pneumonia, 7091 were fatal. The number of cases of 
pneumonia to each death is 4.4. This death-rate in cases of pneu- 
monia is much larger than is usual in civil hospitals and private 
practice. How is this fact to be explained ? Dr. Woodward sug- 
gests explanations which doubtless in a great measure account for 
it. In a large proportion of cases pneumonia occurred as a sequel 
of measles, and abundant testimony to the mortality under these 
circumstances has been presented in a previous chapter. In many

diarrhoea and chronic malarial poisoning ; and in not a few in- 
stances it is probable that deaths were reported from pneumonia 
when this or some other affection of the lungs was developed in 
the course of the diseases embraced under the name " camp fever." 
The death-rate may thus be explained without reference to the 
treatment — the latter doubtless differing considerably, according 
to the different views held by army medical officers. Dr. Wood- 
ward states that the mortality from pneumonia was greater in the 
British army in the Crimea than during the late war in this coun- 
try, the death-rate in the former having been one to every 3.6 
cases. — Editor.

Importance 
of pneumo- 
nia in view 
of its preva- 
lence and 
fatality. 



The prevalence of pneumonia in the Confederate army, and 
the high rate of mortahty amongst the cases treated in 
the field and in the general hospitals, invested this dis- 
ease with peculiar interest and importance ; and the 
writer urged upon the Surgeon-General the importance 
of a thorough examination of the relative value of the different 
modes of treatment employed by the Confederate surgeons. The 
following pages contain facts relating to pneumonia, which were 
contained in a report to the Surgeon-General during the progress 
of the recent civil war : —

From this table it appears that in the Confederate army with 
Analysis of a mean monthly strength of 160,231 officers and men, 
tabie!^^'^^ 1,057,349 cases of disease and wounds were entered upon 
the field reports during a period of nineteen months (January, 
1862, to July, 1863, inclusive) ; and of this number pneumonia 
constituted 28,273. 

Seventeen and six tenths per cent, of the mean, strength of the 
army, on an average, suffered with pneumonia during a period of 
nineteen months ; and this disease constituted two and seven 
tenths per cent, of all cases of disease and wounds entered upon 
the field reports. 

During this period of nineteen months, 397,406 cases of disease 
and wounds were entered upon the hospital reports, and of this 
number 15,542 were recorded as pneumonia; and this disease, 
therefore, constituted 3.15 per cent, of all the cases of disease and 
wounds entered upon the hospital reports. 



CASES NUMEROUS IN WINTER AND SPRING. 



337 



The cases of pneumonia entered upon the field and hospital re- 
ports were relatively most numerous as compared to the Cases most 
mean strength and the total sick and wounded during the the wiuter 
months of December, January, February, March, and months. 
April ; whilst the smallest number of cases were recorded upon the 
field reports and transferred to the general hospitals during the 
months of August, September, and October. As a general rule 
the cases of pneumonia diminished, as the temperature became 
more elevated, and the vicissitudes of the season less marked. 
The month of July, 1862, is an apparent exception, but it will be 
observed that the number transferred to the general hospitals was 
very small, only 491, or 2.59 per cent, of all diseases and wounds ; 
and during the same month, in 1863, the number of cases of pneu- 
monia is smaller relatively than in any other month, being only 
0.106 per cent, of the mean strength, and 0.98 per cent, of the 
sick and wounded transferred to the general hospital. 

The disease, therefore, would appear to depend in large measure 
upon seasons ; or, in other words, upon the effects of exposure to 
cold and wet, and to marked vicissitudes of heat and moisture. 
The following table presents data for the investigation of the effects 
of elevation, geographical position and temperature upon the prev- 
alence of pneumonia : —

CASES ON THE GULF COAST. 341 

In the Confederate forces serving in Virginia (chiefly in this 
State) and North CaroHna, with a monthly mean strength ^ases in 
of 79,396, during a period of nineteen months, 443,167 ^^'^''''*- 
cases of disease and wounds were entered upon the field reports, 
and of this number pneumonia constituted 11,025 ; that is, on an 
average during this period, 13.88 per cent, of the mean strength 
was affected with pneumonia, and this disease constituted 2.48 per 
cent, of all cases entered upon the field reports. During the same 
period 303,886 sick and wounded were entered upon the hospital 
reports, and of this number, 10,743, or 3.53 per cent, were re- 
corded as pneumonia. 

In the army of the West, afterwards called the army of Ten- 
nessee, which operated chiefly in the elevated regions of cases in the 
Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, and Mississippi, with a west, 
monthly mean strength of 40,273 during a period of twelve months, 
226,721 cases of disease and wounds were entered upon the field 
reports (some of the hospital reports appear to have been lost), 
and of this number, pneumonia constituted 6974 ; that is, on an 
average during this period, extending from the 1st of June, 1862, 
to the 31st of May, 1863, 17.31 per cent, of the mean strength 
were attacked by pneumonia, and this disease constituted 3.07 per 
cent, of all cases entered upon the field reports ; during the 
period of twelve months (April 1st to October 31st ; May 1st to 
July 31st), in the hospitals of the West, located in Tennessee, 
Upper Georgia, and Alabama, 54,672 sick and wounded were en- 
tered upon the reports, and of this number 2957, or 5.43 per cent., 
were recorded as pneumonia. 

The proportion of cases of pneumonia appears, therefore, to have 
been greater in the elevated regions of the West, than in cases more 
Virginia. It is probable that the modifying effects of "bTwe^'sr '"^ 
the ocean upon the climate of Virginia, was the chief Virginia. 
cause of this difference. On the other hand, in an army of 25,670 
men (average monthly strength), serving along the low hot coast 
of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, during a period of nineteen 
months, only 8.25 per cent, of the entire command (mean strength) 
were attacked by pneumonia ; and this disease constituted only 
1.35 per cent, of the total number of diseases and wounds entered 
upon the field reports. 

The percentage of the mean strength attacked upon the Gulf 
coast, was somewhat higher even than in the army of cases 
Tennessee ; the ratio of the cases of pneumonia being 
17.22 per cent, of the monthly mean strength. It is to be observed, 



on the 
Gulf coast. 



342 FATALITY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

however, that the force servino; in and around Mobile, on the Gulf 
coast, was comparatively small, being only 6752 officers and men, 
and the statistics embrace both the field and hospital reports. This 
confusion, therefore, of the field and general hospital reports ren- 
ders it impossible to institute a just comparison with the armies of 
Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carohna and Georgia. It appears, 
also, that the troops on the Gulf coast were subjected to a more 
moist and malarious climate than the mass of the troops serving in 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. A large portion of the 
troops serving along the Atlantic coast, in the latter department,* 
were encamped in dry, sandy, pine-barren, healthy locations, which, 
although elevated but a few feet above the level of the ocean, are, 
nevertheless, remarkably free from diseases of the pulmonary 
organs of a serious character. 

It appears, therefore, from these statistics, that pneumonia pre- 
vailed to the greatest extent in the more elevated and northern 
regions of the Southern Confederacy, and in the armies which 
were subjected to the severest labors, privations, and exposures. 
Pneumonia Pneumouia not only prevailed to a considerable ex- 
fatoroT^ tent amongst the Confederate troops, but it was also one 

diseases. ^£ ^^^ ^^^^ f^^^| ^f disCaSCS. 

Thus in a command with a monthly mean strength of 25,670 
Fatality in Hicn, scrviug iu the department of South Carolina, Geor- 
una*^Geor2a g^^^ ^^'^ Florida, duriiig a period of nineteen moiiths ( Jan- 
*nd Florida. ' ^^^^^^ 1862-July, 1863), 2220 cases of pneumonia, with 
127 deaths, were entered upon the field reports, and 1786 cases, with 
370 deaths upon the hospital reports. As the cases were, in most 
instances, first entered upon the field reports, and then transferred 
to the general hospitals, we will approximate more nearly to the 
truth, by assuming that the 2220 cases of pneumonia, entered upon 
the field reports, include those also transferred to the general hos- 
pitals, and the mortality of the cases treated in general hospitals, 
should be added to the mortality of the cases treated in the field ; 
thus giving a mortality of 497 in 2220 cases of pneumonia. Ac- 
cording to this calculation, 22.3 per cent, of the cases of pneumo- 
nia terminated fatally, or one death occurred in 4.4 cases. 

In the Confederate army serving on the Gulf of Mexico, in and 
Fatality on arouud Mobile, with a mean monthly strength of 6752, 
Mexico. the cases of pneumonia numbered 1161, and the deaths 
from this disease 151, during a period of eighteen months ; or one 
death in 7.6 cases of pneumonia. 

In the army of Tennessee, during a period of fourteen months. 



FATALITY IN CONFEDERATE HOSPITALS. 343 

7 cases of pneumonia were recorded, with 1291 deaths ; the ratio 
of deaths, from this disease, being 15.5 percent., or one Fatality ia 
death in 6.4 cases. The hospital reports gave a still Tennessee, 
higher mortality, namely, 18.2 per cent., or one death in 5.4 cases. 

Upon the field reports of General T. J. (Stonewall) Jackson's 
army, serving in the Valley of Virginia, during a period Cases in the 
of ten months, with an average monthly mean strength Virginia. 
of 15,562 officers and men, 1034 cases of pneumonia were re- 
ported. During this short period, 6.6 per cent, of the mean 
strength were aftected with this disease. The number of deaths 
entered upon the field reports of General " Stonewall " Jackson's 
army, was only 50, or 4.8 per cent, of the cases. The returns of 
deaths were incomplete ; it was also true, that the cases of pneu- 
monia in this active and fighting army were in most cases trans- 
ferred to the general hospitals, and chiefly to the large general 
hospital at Staunton. The statistics of the Staunton General Hos- 
pital fiirnish the most correct data for an estimate of the mortality 
of pneumonia amongst the forces serving in the Valley of Virginia, 
throughout the war, under Generals Jackson and Early. During 
a period of forty-four months (July, 1861-February, 1865), in the 
General Hospital at Staunton, Virginia, 833 cases of pneumonia 
were treated, with 191 deaths. In this large and well-conducted 
hospital 22.9 per cent, (or one death in 4.3 cases) of the cases of 
pneumonia terminated fatally. A portion of this mortality, as well 
as of the mortality in typhoid fever and gunshot wounds, was at- 
tributable to the previous exposures and fatigue of the sick in 
transportation from a distance, during the active operations of the 
Confederate forces. 

The statistics of the general hospitals of Virginia, exclusive of 
the hospitals in and around Richmond, possess great in- statistics of 
terest, as furnishing the most reliable data for the deter- geneS^'''* 
mination of the rate of mortality in pneumonia. During hospitals. 
a period of fourteen months 4864 cases of pneumonia were entered 
upon these hospital reports, with a mortality of 1261 ; the ratio of 
deaths amongst this large number of cases of pneumonia, treated 
in some of the largest and best conducted hospitals in the Southern 
Confederacy, was 25.9 per cent., or one death in 3.8 

cases. Fatalityfrom

1.2 



FATALITY FROM PNEUMONIA AND TYPHOID FEV 

From the preceding table we gather that during this period of 
fifteen months, one hundred and thirteen thousand nine Analysis of 
hundred and foiurteen (113,914) cases of various dis- tabic. 
eases and gunshot wounds were treated in the hospitals of Vir- 
ginia, exclusive of the hospitals in and around Richmond ; out of 
this number of cases, five thousand five hundred and sixteen 
(5516) proved fatal. 

The ratio of deaths from all causes to the entire number of cases 
treated was 4.85 per cent., or one death in every 20.65 cases. 

The deaths from common continued fever are here included 
under the head of tj^hoid fever. After a careful exam- common 

„ . -. . -, continued 

ination or many cases registered as common contmued and typhoid 
fever, and after conferences upon this subject with nu- cai. 
merous surgeons in Virginia, I have been convinced that the great 
majority of the cases reported as common continued fever are 
nothing more than cases of typhoid fever. As the cases recorded 
as common continued fever amount to near one third the number 
of typhoid fever, and as the vast majority of the former should 
have been classed as the latter, the most accurate calculation is 
that which combines the two classes together. The ratio of deaths 
to the cases of typhoid fever and common continued fever was 
25.92 per cent., or one death from typhoid and common continued 
fever in 3.85 cases. The ratio of deaths from typhoid and common 
continued fever, to the entire number of deaths from all causes, is 
29.35 per cent., or one death from these diseases in 3.4 deaths from 
all causes. Whilst on the other hand the ratio of cases of typhoid 
and common continued fever to the entire number of cases treated 
is 5.48 per cent., or one case of these diseases in 18.25 cases of all 
diseases. 

A fraction more than one fourth the cases of pneumonia termi- 
nated fatally, or more exactly 22.86 per cent., or one percentage 
death in 3.78 cases of pneumonia. The ratio of the f/om pneu- 
deaths from pneumonia, to the deaths from all causes, °'°'''''- 
was 22.86 per cent., or one death from pneumonia in every 4.37 
deaths from all causes ; whilst on the other hand the cases of 
pneumonia amounted to only 4.16 per cent, of the entire number 
of cases. 

Typhoid fever, common continued fever, and pneumonia to- 
gether, caused two thousand eight hundred and eiglity ratauty 
deaths, out of five thousand five hundred and sixteen monia^nnd 
deaths from all diseases ; that is, a little more than one Sr?'"* 
half the deaths from all causes Avere due to typhoid fever and 
pneumonia, or more exactly 52.39 per cent. 



346 ANALYSIS OF TABLES. 

12.7 per cent, of the cases were classed under the head of 
Fatality chronic and acute diarrhoea and dysentery, whilst the 
diseases. mortality from these diseases was 4.05 per cent, of the 
cases of diarrhoea and dysentery, and 10.51 per cent, of the entire 
number of deaths from all causes. 

Only one case out of 11.6 of all diseases was due directly to the 
casualties of war ; that is, the cases of gunshot wounds were only 
8.59 per cent, of the entire number of cases. The mortality from 
gunshot wounds was a Uttle less than one tenth of the entire 
number of deaths from all causes, or more exactly 9.35 per cent., 
or one death from gunshot wounds in every 10.69 deaths. 

The ratio of deaths from all causes to the entire number of 
Analysis of cascs treated in the hospitals in and around Richmond, 
positepage. Va., duHng a period of seven months, September, 1862, 
to March, 1863, was 4.11 per cent., or one death in 24.37 cases. 

The record of the deaths, during several months, was incom- 
plete. In this table, as in the preceding and succeeding tables, 
I determined the' number of deaths from various diseases from the 
long rolls in which the name of the deceased soldier, together with 
the disease causing death, was recorded, without any classification 
as to the disease. In several of the monthly reports, large por- 
tions of these rolls were absent from the consolidated medical 
directors' reports. The labor necessary to the classification of the 
diseases causing several thousand deaths was very great. In this 
table, as in the previous one, the deaths from common continued 
fever are included under the head of typhoid fever. During six 
months, September, October, November, 1862, January, Febru- 
ary, and March, 1863, two thousand seven hundred and forty- 
eight (2748) cases were recorded of typhoid and common con- 
tinued fever, and during the same period seven hundred and 
twenty-three deaths from these diseases. Therefore more than 
one fourth, or 26.31 per cent, of the cases of typhoid fever, termi- 
nated fatally ; that is, one case of typhoid and common continued 
fever proved fatal in 3.8 cases. During this period of six months 
the deaths from these diseases constituted 24.94 per cent, of the 
deaths from all causes ; that is, one eighth of the entire deaths were 
caused by typhoid and common continued fever (one death from 
typhoid and common continued fever in eight deaths fi'om all 
causes). 

During four months, September, 1862, January, February, and 
March, 1863, one thousand five hundred and twenty-seven cases 
of pneumonia were entered, with four hundred and five deaths.

348 ANALYSIS OF TABLES. 

During this period the ratio of deaths from pneumonia to the en- 
tire number of deaths from all causes was 19.22 per cent., or one 
death from pneumonia in 5.42 deaths from all causes ; whilst on 
the other hand, the cases of pneumonia during these four months 
were only 3.54 per cent, of the entire number of cases treated 
during this period. 

During four months, September, 1862, January, February, and 
March, 1863, typhoid fever, common continued fever, and pneu- 
monia caused 41.67 per cent, of all the deaths from all causes. 

It is important to note that the hospitals in and around Rich- 
mond were, to a considerable extent, supplied with convalescent 
patients. 

During four months, April, May, June, and July, 1863, one 
Analysis of hundred and eight thousand one hundred and sixty-five 
positepage. (108,165) cascs wcrc treated in the general hospitals in 
Virginia, including those in and around Richmond ; and the num- 
ber of deaths during this period was two thousand seven hundred 
and five (2705). The ratio of deaths from all causes, to the entire 
number of cases treated, was 2,5 per cent. ; that is, one death in 
39.98 cases. 

The ratio of deaths from typhoid and common continued fever 
to the entire number of cases of these diseases, was 17.77 per cent., 
or one death from these diseases in 5.62 cases. The deaths from 
typhoid and common continued fever constituted 18.82 per cent, 
of the entire number of deaths from all causes ; whilst the cases 
of typhoid and common continued fever formed only 2.64 per cent, 
of the entire number of cases of all diseases. 

24.14 per cent, of the cases of pneumonia terminated fatally, or 
one death in 4.05 cases of pneumonia. 

21.29 per cent, of the deaths from all causes were due to pneu- 
monia ; whilst, on the other hand, this disease formed only 2.16 
per cent, of the entire number of cases of all diseases. 

Pneumonia and typhoid fever, and common continued fever, to- 
gether, caused 40.11 per cent, of the entire number of deaths from 
all causes, these diseases included ; or one death from these dis- 
eases occurred in 2.49 deaths from all causes ; whilst, on the other 
hand, the cases of pneumonia, typhoid, and common continued 
fever, constituted only 4.81 per cent, of the entire number of cases 
treated. 

If the statistics of individual hospitals be examined, similar re- 
sults will be obtained. We have selected the records of the Gen-

850 TYPHOID FEVER IK SUMMER AND AUTUMN. 

eral Hospital at Charlottesville, because they date from an early 
period of the war, and have been accumulated under the able 
administration of intelligent surgeons, and has drawn its patients 
directly from the largest army in the Confederacy. 

In the General Hospital of Charlottesville, Va., a small fraction 
Analysis of less than ouc fourtli the cases of typhoid fever, or one in 
positepage. 4.15 cascs (24.05 per cent.), terminated fatally. The 
ratio of the cases of typhoid fever, to the entire number of cases 
from all causes, was S.66 per cent., or one case of typhoid fever in 
11.54 cases of all diseases ; whilst the deaths from typhoid fever 
were more than one third of the entire number fi'om all causes, or, 
more exactly, one death from typhoid fever in 2.78 deaths, thus 
giving a ratio of 35.94 per cent, of deaths from typhoid fever. On 
the other, hand, the ratio of deaths from all causes to the entire 
number of cases treated, was 5.79 per cent., or one death in 17.24 
cases of all diseases treated. 

Nearly one third, or, more exactly, 31.9 per cent, of the cases 
of pneumonia terminated fatally, that is, one death occurred in 
every 3.12 cases of pneumonia. The ratio of deaths from pneu- 
monia, to the entire number of deaths from all causes, was 23.84 
per cent., or one death fi'om pneumonia in 4.17 deaths from all 
causes, pneumonia included. On the other hand, the cases of 
pneumonia were less than one twenty-third of the entire number 
of cases (4.32 per cent.), or, more plainly, one case of pneumonia 
in 23.13 cases of all diseases, pneumonia included. 

Typhoid fever and pneumonia, together, caused 519 deaths out 
of 868 deaths from all causes, these diseases included. That is, 
typhoid fever and pneumonia caused more than one half, or 59.9 
per cent, of the deaths from all causes, gunshot wounds included ; 
or, one death from pneumonia and typhoid fever occurred in every 
1.67 deaths. On the other hand, the cases of pneumonia and 
typhoid fever, were only 12.98 per cent, of the entire cases. And 
the ratio of deaths from all causes, to the entire number of cases, 
was 5.79 per cent., or one death in 17.24 cases of all diseases 
treated. 

The largest number of cases of typhoid fever occurred in July, 
Typhoid August, September, and October, 1861, and during the 
prevalent in first thirteen months (July, 1861-July, 1863, inclusive), 
autumn. 1094 cascs of typhoid fever entered the hospital, whilst 
during the last thirteen months (August, 1862-August, 1863, in- 
clusive), only about one fifth the number of cases of typhoid fever

362 FATALITY IN HOSPITALS AT SAVANNAH. 

entered, or, more exactly, 203 cases. During the first thirteen 
months, 253 deaths from typhoid fever occurred ; whilst during the 
last thirteen months only 60 deaths, or not quite one fourth the 
number of the first thirteen months. During the first thirteen 
months, 1040 cases of measles were entered ; whilst during the last 
thirteen months, only 20 cases of measles were recorded. This 
disease, therefore, like typhoid fever, decreased as the war ad- 
vanced. As a general rule, mankind are afflicted with these 
diseases but once during a lifetime, and during this war both 
diseases appear to have been intimately connected in their origin 
and spread with the crowding together of the soldiers ; whilst they 
are, without doubt, due to distinct and wholly different poisons, still 
they have in this war been associated, to a certain extent, in the 
time and circumstances of their origin and diffusion. We observe 
no such law governing pneumonia. This disease was most abun- 
dant during the cold, wet, and changeable weather of winter and 
spring, and there was no marked diminution of the disease as the 
war progressed, beyond that incident to the hardening and strength- 
ening of the troops under exposure and fatigue. 

The cases of gunshot wounds were 18.99 per cent, of the en- 
tire number of cases ; and the deaths from gunshot wounds were 
17.62 per cent, of the entire number of deaths, or, 5.44 per cent, 
of the entire number of cases of gunshot wounds treated. 

In instituting comparison between the statistics of the General 
Size and Hospital of CharlottcsviUe, and those of other portions of 
hospital at the Confederate States, it should be borne in mind, that 
Tiue. the General Hospital of Charlottesville was one of the 

nearest hospitals to the largest and most active army in the South- 
em Confederacy. The severest cases of disease were, as a general 
rule, left at this and other hospitals nearest to the scene of active 
service ; whilst the mildest cases were forwarded to the more dis- 
tant hospitals. It results from these facts, that, all things being 
equal, as to treatment, nourishment, and hygiene, the mortality in 
a hospital thus situated and supplied with patients must neces- 
sarily be heavier than in hospitals connected with armies much 
smaller and comparatively at rest, where large numbers of the 
severe cases were treated in the field hospitals. 

As high as the preceding rates of mortality in pneumonia and 
Fatality in typhoid fcvcr may appear, they are not as high as in 
satannahf so^c othcrs of the Confederate hospitals. Thus, in the 
nia^a^nd'Ty^" ^^o general hospitals of Savannah, Ga., Nos. 1 and 2, 
phoidfeTcr. ^^iQ ratio of mortality in these diseases was extraordi- 



MORTALITY IN SAVANNAH HOSPITALS. 353 

larily high. And we are at a loss to account for this high death- 
rate, from the fact that these liospitals were connected with a com- 
paratively small and inactive army. As the troops serving in and 
around Savannah were greatly exposed to the influence of mala- 
ria, this depressing agent may have influenced, to a certain extent, 
the death-rate. 

In General Hospital No. 1, Savannah, Ga., during a period of 
twenty-five months (December, 1861 — December, 1863, inclusive), 
178 cases of typhoid fever were recorded, with 91 deaths. In this 
hospital, therefore, more than one half proved fatal. The percent- 
age of deaths in the cases of typhoid fever was 51.12 ; that is, one 
death occurred in 1.95 cases. Between one third and one fourth of 
the entire deaths from all causes were from typhoid fever, or, more 
exactly, one death from typhoid fever occurred in every 3.65 deaths ; 
the deaths from typhoid fever were 27 per cent, of the entire 
deaths from all causes. On the other hand, the cases of typhoid 
fever were a little less than two and a half per cent, of the entire 
number of cases of all diseases ; or, more exactly, 2.48 per cent, 
of the entire number ; or, the ratio of cases of tyj)hoid fever was 
as 1 to 40. 

In the cases of pneumonia, a httle over one third, or one in 3.18, 
or 31.35 per cent, proved fatal. More than one third of the entire 
deaths, from all diseases, were caused by pneumonia ; or, one death 
from pneumonia occurred in every 2.87 deaths, giving 34.83 per 
cent, of deaths from pneumonia. On the other hand, only a Httle 
over five per cent. (5.17 per cent.) of the cases entered upon the 
sick reports were recorded as pneumonia, giving a ratio of one 
case of pneumonia to 19.32 cases. 

Pneumonia and typhoid fever, together, caused 207 deaths out 
of 333, the entire number ; that is, these two diseases alone occa- 
sioned nearly two thirds of the entire number of deaths from all 
causes ; or, more exactly, one death in every 1.6 deaths, or 62 per 
cent, of deaths. Whilst on the other hand, these diseases consti- 
tuted only 7.65 per cent, of the entire number of cases. 

Fewer cases of typhoid fever were received in 1863 than in 
1862 ; thus in the former year, 74 were entered, whilst in the lat- 
ter, the sum was about one third greater, or 100. 

In General Hospital No. 2, Savannah, Ga., during nineteen 
months (June, 1862 — December, 1863), a small fraction over one 
fourth of the cases of typhoid fever proved fatal ; that is, one death 
occurred in every 3.918 cases, giving 25.5 as the percentage of 
deaths in the cases of typhoid fever. Of the total number of 

23 



o54 MORTALITY IN SAVANNAH HOSPITALS. , 

deaths, between one third and one fourth were from typhoid fever, 
or, more exactly, one death from typhoid fever in 3.378 deaths from 
all causes ; thus yielding a ratio of deaths from typhoid fever, to the 
deaths fi'om all causes, of 29.6 per cent. On the other hand, the 
ratio of cases of typhoid fever to the entire number of cases treated 
of all diseases was only 4.26 per cent., or between one twenty- 
third and one twenty-fourth of the entire number of cases (one 
case of typhoid fever occurred in every 23.4 cases of all diseases) ; 
and the ratio of deaths from all causes, to the entire number of 
cases, was 3.67 per cent. 

A little less than one fourth the cases of pneumonia (or one in 
4.32 cases, 23.14 per cent.) terminated fatally. One fifth of the 
deaths from all causes, were due to pneumonia, whilst the ratio of 
cases of pneumonia to the entire number from all diseases was 
only 3.174 per cent. 

Pneumonia and typhoid fever together, caused 62 deaths out of 
125, or very nearly one half the entire number of deaths from all 
causes ; whilst the ratio of cases of pneumonia and typhoid fever 
to the entire number of cases of all diseases was only 4.49 per 
cent. 

Twenty-nine deaths, or nearly one fourth of the entire number 
of deaths, were attributed to remittent and congestive fever, in 
Hospital No. 2, Savannah, Ga. From June, 1862, to December, 
1862 (six months), 13 deaths from remittent fever were recorded, 
out of only 141 cases treated ; that is, nearly one tenth of the 
cases of remittent fever during this period proved fatal. In view 
of the present enlightened and successful mode of treatment in 
this disease, this is certainly a remarkable ratio of mortality. 

The statistics might be greatly extended, but they are sufficient 
for comparative purposes. The following tables will furnish the 
necessary data for comparison with the records of other hospi- 
tals : —

In the large number of cases (344,063) treated in these hospi- 
tals, 13,542 deaths are recorded, and of this number typhoid fever 
and pneumonia caused very nearly one half. 

The last observation which we shall sustain by statistics, is that 
Progressive typlioid fcvcr progrcssively diminished during the prog- 
oftheprev- I'css of the war, and disappeared almost entirely from 
typhoid the veteran armies ; whilst, on the other hand, pneu- 
thewar. moiiia coutiuued to prevail, and appeared to be chiefly 
dependent upon the vicissitudes of the climate. 

This statement is clearly sustained by the preceding statistics of 
the General Hospitals in Virginia. 

The statistics which v.-e consolidated from all the returns on file 
in the Surgeon-General's Office, do not extend over nineteen 
months, but even during this comparatively short period we 
observe a verification of the preceding observation, as will be 
shown by the following table : —

ANALYSIS OF TABLES. 359 

In the preceding tables we observe a progressive and marked 
diminution of the cases of typhoid fever, whilst the Analysis of 
yearly fluctuations of pneumonia are not referable to any tables. 
such law. 

Thus, in the General Hospital of Charlottesville, during the 
year 1861, the cases of disease and wounds numbered 4781, with 
342 deaths ; of this number pneumonia constituted 143 cases and 
42 deaths, and ty]^)hoid fever 866 cases and 193 deaths. During 
the year 1862, the total cases entered upon the hospital records 
numbered 6692, \nth. 381 deaths ; of these, there were of pneu- 
monia, 370 cases and 138 deaths ; typhoid fever, 299 cases and 91 
deaths. During 1863, total cases, 4932, and deaths, 189 ; pneu- 
monia, 190 cases, 46 deaths ; typhoid fever, 190 cases, 43 deaths. 
During 1864, total cases, 4850, deaths, 208 ; pneumonia, 143 cases, 
28 deaths ; typhoid fever, 71 cases and 30 deaths. 

In the General Hospital of Charlottesville, during the first 
twenty-six months, the largest number of cases of typhoid fever 
occurred in July, August, September, and October, 1861 ; and 
during the first thirteen months (July, 1861 — Jnly, 1862, both 
months inclusive) 1094 cases of typhoid fever entered the hos- 
pital ; whilst during the last thirteen months (August, 1862 
— August, 1863, inclusive) only about one fifth the number of 
cases of typhoid fever entered, or, more exactly, 203 cases. 
During the first period of thirteen months, 253 deaths from 
typhoid fever occurred ; whilst during the last thirteen months 
there were only 60 deaths, or not quite one fifth the number of 
the first thirteen months. 

In the General Hospital of Staunton the cases of typhoid fever 
decreased in the following manner : In 1861, 868 cases and 47 
deaths ; in 1862, 779 cases and 239 deaths ; in 1863, 365 cases 
and 58 deaths ; in 1864, 192 cases and 29 deaths. The sum total 
of cases of typhoid fever during both the years 1863 and 1864 was 
far less than during either 1861 and 1862, notwithstanding that the

this chapter, war 1 held tor a time the post ot visitmg physician to one 
of the largest military hospitals, and subsequently had in other hos- 
pitals wards allotted to me, to which soldiers affected with thoracic, 
particularly with cardiac disease, were sent. Some of the forms of 
these diseases were constantly recurring, and presented features of 
so much interest that they were carefally noted and studied. Notes 
of upwards of four hundred cases are thus in my possession ; and 
while taking them as the basis of some of the deductions here made, 
I retain for analysis and publication elsewhere several gi'oups of 
them, which, minutely analyzed, would require a more extended 
discussion than it is either desirable or convenient here to enter 
into. But an examination, especially of organic affections, inquir- 
ing into their cause, their disqualifying effect for doing duty, and 
the possibility of averting or remedying them, will, I trust, furnish 
a contribution not out of place in this volume, and in keeping with 
its general spirit. 

First let me say a few words about valvular diseases. They 
Valvular Were not on the whole very common, that is, the mass 
diseases. q£ thosc presenting cardiac disorders did not present 
signs of valvular disease. But when this was detected it was

362 CASES NOT PRECEDED BY RHEUMATISM. 

Looking over this table, we find these results : Of the thirty 
Cases of cases, fifteen had rheumatism for the first time while in 
di8.Mse foi- service, and ten of these had acute articular rheumatism. 

lowingrheu- i i /> i i x i • • 

uiatL-m. produced tor the most part by exposure. In the remammg 
five, the attacks had been more subacute or muscular, and they are 
marked in the table simply as rheumatism. Five cases presented 
the history of cardiac disease prior to enhsting, and several of 
these again had had articular rheumatism. One of them had a 
slight attack of rheumatism prior to the war, but also stated that 
he inherited disease of the heart from his mother. Two patients 
first noticed the cardiac disturbance after heavy marching, to 
which they attributed it, though it might be thought more likely 
that it had existed before. With greater certainty may this be said 
of one patient (Case XVIII.), who asserted that it was only after a 
severe attack of diarrhoea that his heart at all annoyed him. Four 
of the cases mentioned in the table believed that they had been 
seized with pneumonia, being previously in excellent health, and 
that since the acute malady the cardiac symptoms had developed 
themselves. 

The first of these patients (Case II.) stated that he had flying 
Cases not rlicumatic pains, particularly in the shoulder joints, prior 

preceded by t - i • n n • n i ^ i 

rheumatism, to eulistmg, and occasioually iluttermg oi the heart when 
lifting heavy timbers. But he was able to serve with his regi- 
ment throughout the spring and summer campaign of 1864, doing 
much marching ; and as it was only after a severe attack of in- 
flammation within the chest, called pneumonia, that he became 
troubled with shortness of breath and expectorated pure blood, it 
may well be questioned if there existed any previous disease of the 
heart. It should be added that before being sent to the hospital 
in September he contracted fever, and had chills and night sweats. 
While under my observation he presented the physical signs of 
mitral constriction with some regurgitation, and excessive irregular- 
ity of the action of the heart, attended with great shortness of breath, 
and at times with giddiness. Either, it is evident, a valvular affec- 
tion had developed itself subsequent to the acute seizure, or a 
slight preexisting disorder had been greatly aggravated by this 
and the heavy marching. 

In the second instance of disease of the valves following an 
acute attack (Case IX.), no such doubtful point can be adduced. 
The man, a private in Company B, 187th Pennsylvania Volunteers, 
had been an active farmer before enlisting in January, 1864. He 
never had had a severe disease, never acute rheumatism ; had had 



VALVULAR DISEASES. 363 

occasionally pain in the left shoulder, but was a vigorous man in 
fine health when he joined his regiment. He did hard duty with 
it until the 28th of August, 1864, participating in all the marches 
south of the Rapidan, and was in most of the battles and skirmishes 
which occurred. He was found to possess aortic insufficiency 
marked to a high degree, and though he attributed the cardiac 
complaint chiefly to heavy marching and to the weight of the car- 
tridges, he also mentioned having had something like an acute 
seizure ; stating, that while on a march he was attacked with severe 
pain in the left side, which persisted and was soon accompanied 
by spells of faintness on exertion. In spite of this, he did more or 
less duty for two or three months, until he was sent to the Cuyler 
Hospital, and he was thence transferred for special treatment to 
my wards in Philadelphia. 

In the third case (Case XII.), also, aortic disease existed. But 
the signs were those of constriction rather than of insufficiency. 
The patient was a private in the 22d New York Cavalry, forty 
years of age, and had been a blacksmith before joining the army. 
He was in excellent health when he enlisted in January, 1864, and 
had almost constantly enjoyed good health, though he stated that 
on two occasions prior to enlisting he had pneumonia, and that 
years before the war he had rheumatic pains in the hips and knees, 
but not severe, nor had he ever an attack of acute rheumatism. He 
was in several fights, and in one of these, in May, 1864, was dis- 
mounted, after which he was obliged to march on foot, which he 
did, from Port Royal, Va., to City Point. About the 15th of 
June he was seized with an acute thoracic affection, which he says 
was pronounced pneumonia. He recovered from this with some 
pain in the cardiac region, and with shortness of breath ; the least 
exertion wearied him. He was ordered to Washington, and re- 
mounted in July, 1864 ; and soon afterwards did service in the 
Valley of the Shenandoah, but most of the time as blacksmith. 
The difficulty of breathing, however, increased so much, that 
after August 24th he was unable to do duty any longer. He 
was sent to several hospitals, and transferred to my wards Sep- 
tember 29th ; his main symptom was shortness of breath on ex- 
ertion. The murmur was systolic, and very rough, of greatest 
intensity to the right of the sternum, and unattended by receding 
pulse, or throbbing of carotids, or very forcible impulse. The 
percussion-dullness in the cardiac region was not that of a de- 
cidedly enlarged heart, measuring only two inches and three quar- 
ters transversely, three and one quarter perpendicularly, and three 



364 ABSENCE OF BRIGHT'S DISEASE, ETC. 

and a half obliquely. The chest was thirty-five and a half inches 
in circumference. 

The fourth case (Case XXI.) was that of a private in the 
109tli New York Volunteers. Before enlisting, in December 22, 
1863, he was a carpenter, and in admirable health ; never had liad 
rheumatism, or any sign of cardiac disturbance. He was taken 
sick February 15th, 1864, the day after arriving in Washington, 
with pain in the left side, etc., and was thought to have pneumo- 
nia of the left lung. He recovered slowly, but had pain about the 
heart, which he distinctly remembered to have annoyed him in 
March. His recovery was about that time considered sufficient to 
enable him to do light duty ; and when his regiment was ordered 
to join the 9th Corps he accompanied it, going for the first time 
into the field. He was much troubled with palpitations while on 
the march, and on arriving at Warrenton Junction was attacked 
w^ith a malarial fever, for which, May 2d, he was sent back from 
the front. He had thus, if the march to the front be excepted, 
never done any active duty. He remained four months under 
observation, presenting the signs of mitral regurgitation, with forci- 
ble action of the heart, though with but slight increase in its size. 
His general appearance was good, even when first seen, and he 
never showed the least signs of anaemia. 

I have given the histories of these cases somewhat in detail. 
Absence of bccausc they bear on a very interesting point of cardiac 
Brigh?8dis- pathology — the occurrence of endocardial inflammation, 
^Ith'ew'^c"^ and subsequent valvular disease, mthout antecedent rheu- 
thepreced- Hiatism, or Bright's disease, or any diathetic affection, 
ing cases. j^ -g ^^^^ ^^isit rhcumatic pains had preexisted in two of 
the cases, but in the last-mentioned of these, at least, not in such 
a manner as to be looked upon as a causing element. The sup- 
position of pneumonia having given rise to the valvular lesion 
is of course not to be entertained. If pneumonia really happened 
at any time, — and only one of the cases (the first) presented any 
signs which rendered the previous occurrence of either pneumonia 
or pleuro-pneumonia a likelihood, — it happened as a complica- 
tion of the endocarditis, the presence of which might very readily 
have been overlooked, or not communicated to the patients. More- 
over, one of them did not say scarcely any thing on the subject of 
the supposed pulmonary inflammation ; but attributed the disease, 
more persistently, to the heavy marching. Thus, then, we have 
cases of endocarditis, contrary to the supposed opinion, of idiopathic 
origin, and it is quite possible that violent efforts in several of them 



INSUFFICIENCY OF PULMONARY VALVES. 365 

ly have acted as predisposing causes, and have had just as much 
to do with the development of the inflammation as any exposure to 
which the men were subjected. 

This may have happened in the case just alluded to (Case IX.), 
which, indeed, has only, on account of some of the state- cases of 

„, , -, I'll 1 Talvular 

ments of the man, been classed with those that were disease at- 

p tributed to 

thought to have presented marked symptoms oi an acute protracted 

1 . /v. . T 1 1 • 1 and violent 

thoracic aitection. In two other cases placed in the tab- exertion. 
ular view for analysis, heavy marching and over-exertion were 
looked upon alone and decidedly as the cause of the cardiac trouble. 
In one of these (Case XIV.), no disorder of the heart whatever 
existed before enlistment, so far as could be ascertained, and the 
first symptom noticed was strong beating of the organ after a great 
deal of marching and exertion. In the second (Case XXV.), 
much the same history was given. In both, the heart was con- 
siderably enlarged ; in one indeed, out of proportion to the amount 
of valvular lesion, and it seems likely that here the affection of 
the valves was the indirect consequence of the enlargement. But 
though this may be said of the instance of mitral insufficiency 
(Case XIV.), it can scarcely be stated of that of aortic constric- 
tion (Case XXV.). We find, then, cases of valvular disease orig- 
inating after heavy marching and violent exertion. Some of these 
may be due to latent idiopathic endocarditis, others are probably 
the consequence of preceding enlargement. 

Fevers are not mentioned in the tabular statement as giving 
rise to valvular disease. Yet many of the patients attributed the 
disorder of the heart to them, particularly to typhoid fever. But 
on analysis it was almost invariably found that these patients had 
had acute rheumatism previously, or signs of cardiac disturbance, 
and that these had become much aggravated after the fever, rather 
than made their appearance with it. 

Concerning the signs and symptoms of the abnormal condition 
of the valves, it is needless to go into detail. However interesting 
to the student of physical diagnosis, it would not serve a useful 
purpose here to examine them, and to see in how far they corre- 
spond with those considered by observers generally, as character- 
istic. But as regards Case XXX., an exception may well be 
made, on account of the rarity of the lesion presented. 

Case XXX. Insufficiency of the Pulmonary Valves. — Henry F. 

L , sergeant Company L, 9th New York Heavy Artillery, was sent 

to my ward, in April, 1865. He was a fine, healthy looking man, who 
complained of nothing excepting shortness of breath, and some pain 



366 INSIJFFICIEi^CY OF PULMONARY VALVES. 

in the cardiac region. The shortness of breath was only markedly 
developed on exertion of any kind ; the pain was not severe, but from 
its persistency, by constantly reminding the patient of the cardiac mal- 
ady, may have been the chief cause of the frequent depression of 
spirits from which he suffered. His digestion was excellent ; there was 
no dropsy. He was unable to trace the disease of the heart to any 
exciting cause. He had been in service almost from the beginning of 
the war, never had had rheumatism; had typhoid fever in 1861, not 
very long after enlisting, and on his recovery from it until he reenlisted, 
saw much active service. Indeed, he was almost constantly on duty 
until three months before his admission into the Filbert Street Hospi- 
tal, until, indeed, a swelled testicle caused him to be placed under med- 
ical care. Since that time, and when returning to duty, after being 
relieved from the affection mentioned, he noticed .palpitation. The 
pulse was 72, full, rather abrupt ; respirations 24 ; the impulse of the 
heart was extended and forcible ; the cardiac percussion-dullness in- 
creased, though not to an extreme degree. On auscultating the heart 
a loud murmur was heard, loudest at the left edge of the sternum, near 
the fourth costal cartilage, and at the fourth interspace, and transmitted 
thence to the left edge of the heart and upwards as far as the clavicle 
on the left side. At the apex it was only faintly perceived, and it was 
scarcely audible, at times wholly inaudible, at or near the aortic carti- 
lage, where a well-marked normal second sound was heard. At the pul- 
monary cartilage, and in the second interspace on the left side, the mur- 
mur was very much more distinct than to the right of the sternum, but 
in the positions indicated on the left side, not a trace of a second sound 
could be discerned. There was no murmur in either carotid. On 
closely analyzing the murmur, at its place of greatest intensity, it was 
found to consist in reality of two : the first short, comparatively indis- 
tinct, systolic, and soon lost as the stethoscope was removed to other 
parts of the cardiac region ; the second long, loud, distinct, and com- 
pletely taking the place of the normal second sound of the valves of 
the pulmonary artery. 

It may be a matter of astonishment that a person with so serious 
a valvular trouble should have suffered on the whole so little from 
it, and should have been able to discharge his duties as a soldier 
for so long a time without any particular inconvenience arising from 
the disease of the heart. For it cannot be supposed that the cardiac 
malady dated merely from the attack of swelled testicle ; but it 
must have existed prior to his re enlisting, and perhaps even prior 
to his entrance into the service. He was an ardent soldier, anxious 
not to be away from his regiment, and nearly always with it. Yet, 
if we except the attack of fever at the outset of his military career, 
his history did not show that he had had any of the diseases inci- 



VALVULAR DISEASE IN ACTIVE SERVICE. 367 

dent to troops, or that he had been obhged to be careful of himself, 
or relinquisli any of his duties, until he went to the hospital for the 
complaint mentioned. But while suffering from the irritation of 
tins, and on returning with his health not in the usually good con- 
dition, he began to be annoyed, or rather, to have his attention 
directed to his heart, and was shortly afterwards sent from camp 
to be treated for the cardiac complaint. This is, indeed, the history 
of very many, I may say of the majority, of these patients. I could 
adduce case upon case that came under my observation during the 
war, of men who did not notice the affection of the heart until some 
acute malady reduced their strength. Sometimes it was a severe 
attack of diarrhoea, but oftener a fever, particularly a typhoid fever, 
or measles. But .whatever the disease, the sequence ran thus : 
little, if any, disturbance previously ; an acute attack ; symptoms 
of cardiac derangement noticed then, or during convalescence, or 
soon after return to duty. 

This statement may seem to invalidate the remarks above made 
as to the presumable origin of some cases of valvular disease in 
acute idiopathic endocarditis with or without active thoracic symp- 
toms, or happening during over exertion. Yet, though this objec- 
tion to the view of the matter cannot be positively set aside, I do 
not think it applies to the cases there cited. They were admitted 
as such only after the most carefld sifting of the evidence they fur- 
nished. The attack was in all of comparatively recent date ; the 
valvular affection was not attended with marked cardiac enlarge- 
ment ; moreover, the men had enlisted at a late period in the war, 
and passed the inspection of the surgeon at a time when much 
greater care was taken with the examination of the recruit, and 
when valvular diseases were not apt to be overlooked. 

But how did it happen that men with valvular affections could 
perform military service at all — could bear the march- _ 

. '' Cases m 

mg, the exposure, the excitement of a soldier's life ? For, ^^^^^^^^g^ 
even deducting all doubtful cases, there were numbers ^^0°°^^''^^ 
whose histories clearly indicated that they had had car- ^fSta^r 
diac disease long prior to its being observed, who had ^''^^• 
yet performed faithfully their duty. For instance. Case XXII. 
presented a clear history of disease of the heart, dating from 
inflammatory rheumatism in 1861. He enhsted January 7th, 

1863, for three years, did continuous duty up to the 30th of April, 

1864, when he caught measles, followed by some rheumatic pains. 
About this period, and during his convalescence, he was noticed to 
have enlargement of the heart, with valvular disease. He came 



368 VALVULAR DISEASE IN ACTIVE SERVICE. 

under my charge August 1st, 1864, had no dropsy, suffered occa- 
sionally from palpitation, complained of pain about the heart, and 
of inability to lie on his left side. The impulse was forcible, and 
extended, and there was a mitral murmur. The pulse was ninety- 
six, not particularly irregular. He was a cavalryman, and it may 
be a question whether his being mounted was not a cause of his 
ability to do duty so long. But even in those serving in other 
arms of the service, the power to perform duty for a considerable 
period was remarked. 

Now, in the explanation of these cases, we must look closely to 
the amount of disturbance of the organ and the extent of the 
coexisting enlargement. When the heart is greatly disturbed in 
its function, or there is much increase in its size, active service 
becomes, for any length of time, an impossibility. Otherwise, it is 
quite possible. I met with an instance of aortic regurgitation 
in a soldier, the type of excellent physical health, who, for a short 
distance at least, was a good runner. And I may, in concluding 
this part of the inquiry, allude to the case of a gentlemaji whom, 
from repeated examinations before the war, I knew to have an 
affection of the mitral valves, and who served creditably during a 
long campaign on the staff of a general high in command, where 
the officers had little rest, and who had, particularly, the reputa- 
tion of not sparing them. The valvular affection was not then, 
and is not now, attended with much discomfort, or evidence of dis- 
order of the circulation. 

I insist thus upon comparative latency of the symptoms, or 
rather upon absence of marked ftmctional disturbance and con- 
siderable enlargement, as essential elements in allowing a valvular 
disease to remain inactive ; and it has been made apparent how, if 
the circulatory function be deranged in consequence of a fever or 
other acute malady, or of any departure from the pre\nous standard 
of general health, the affection of the heart begins to show itself, 
and become troublesome. Yet, let it not be understood that cases 
of tolerance of the cardiac disease, if I may so express myself, bore 
more than a certain — though an unexpectedly large — proportion 
to those in which fatigue and exposure rapidly led to the manifes- 
tations of the symptoms of a disordered heart. For a number of 
my patients with valvular disease told me that almost from the 
first they were unable to keep up with the regiment on the march, 
in consequence of choking sensations, shortness of breath, and gid- 
diness (Cases VII. and XI. were particular illustrations) ; or were 
unable to bear the weight of their knapsacks and equipments ; and, 



CHRONIC PERICARDITIS. 369 

so as not to lag too far behind, were obliged to throw them away. 
It is quite likely that some of these cases of valvular disease died 
sudden deaths, and were grouped among those who, from fatigue, 
had sunk exhausted at the wayside, or had had a sun-stroke. But 
this is a mere surmise, for I have no data for determining the point. 

Pericardial disorders were not, on the whole, frequently en- 
countered. Indeed, considering the hundreds of cases infrequency 
of cardiac affections that I examined, I was struck with % JSS- 
their rarity. When found, they presented, generally, *""""• 
coexisting endocardial trouble, and were rather the remnants of a 
pericarditis with friction indicative of roughening of the membrane, 
or with what could be regarded as presumable signs of adhesion, 
than chronic pericarditis with effusion. In the following case, 
however, there was effusion which disappeared under treatment. 

Case XXXI. Ohronic Pericarditis ; Recovery under Iodide of Potas- 
sium, etc. (Case-Book IV., p. 130). — John W. M , private, Company 

D, 14th New York Artillery, aged nineteen, formerly a farmer ; enlisted 
July 4th, 1863, for three years. He stated that he had felt pain over 
the heart, and had occasional palpitation, before enlisting ; but that the 
examining surgeon, after investigation, pronounced this not to be due 
to a disease of the heart. The battalion to which M. was attached was 
sent to Sandy Hook, N. J., and while there he had a severe attack of 
what he says was regarded as inflammation of the lungs, and was under 
medical treatment for two months. After this seizure he had more 
pain about the heart, with shortness of breath and, at times, palpitation. 
He was transferred with his regiment to the army of the Potomac, in 
March, 1864, and did duty until June 17th, 1864 ; when, in consequence 
of diarrhoea, succeeded by rheumatism, and by an increase of the signs 
of the heart trouble, he was, after having been in a camp hospital, sent 
to a general hospital in July, and to my wards September 14th. He 
had at that time recovered from the diarrhoea, but still had, off and 
on, rheumatic pains in his limbs. He had much difficulty of breathing, 
and complained of the pain in the cardiac region, which constantly 
grew worse toward evening, and was then attended with palpitation. 
His nights were restless ; he could not lie on the left side. Afler he 
had been under observation for a day or two, it was observed that he 
had, occasionally, a slight swelling of the lower limbs, and, more con- 
stantly, of the hands. He was a man of very temperate habits, never 
smoked, chewed, or drank. 

The physical examination showed an impulse extended and very de- 
ficient in force ; an increased percussion-dullness in the cardiac region, 
with soreness to the touch ; and great indistinctness of the sounds of 
the heart, which, however, were very much more distinct at the base 
than at the apex. He was directed to take iodide of potassium, five 

24 



370 HYPERTROPHY OF HEART. 

grains three times daily, while tincture of iodine was painted over the 
front of the left side of the chest; and on the 26th, a solution of bitar- 
trate of potassa was also ordered as a daily drink. Under this treat- 
ment he steadily improved. October 12th it was noted that both sounds 
had become quite distinct, and that the percussion-dullness had decreased. 
This was still more marked by the 27th, and as his symptoms had at 
the same time greatly ameliorated, he was allowed to go home on fur- 
lough. November the 18th he returned, looking well, and nothing 
particularly abnormal could be found upon auscultating the heart. 
Soon afterwards he returned to his regiment. 

From this record, it is difficult to fix the exact period at which 
the pericarditis happened. It either occurred as a complication 
with, and at the time of, the supposed pneumonia, in which case 
the man had the pericardial affection for eight months or upwards, 
before I saw him, and did duty in the field, with his pericardium 
probably filled with fluid ; or the disorder dated from the rheuma- 
tism shortly following the diarrhoea, and was then of nearly three 
months' duration. Though the former view appears the less prob- 
able, the details of the history favor it. 

Let us now turn to other forms of organic disease of the heart, to

Case XXXII. Symptoms of Cardiac Disorder appearing during a 

March; Hypertrophy of Heart (Case-Book IV., p. 236). — Paul S , 

private, Company H, 8th New York Artillery, aged twenty-one years, 
a blacksmith prior to enlisting, joined the army August 12th, 1862, for 
three years. He said, — and repeated examinations failed to elicit any 
contradictory statements, — that before enlisting he had always enjoyed 
excellent health, and had been capable of undergoing much exertion and 
fatigue without any disturbance of the heart. In February, 1864, he 
had an attack of small-pox ; and, on recovering from this, rejoined his 
regiment. On the marches in May, 1864, he had, for the first time, 
pain in the region of the heart, with palpitation, shortness of breath, 
and attacks of faintness, which rendered him unable to keep up with 
his comrades. He nevertheless continued on duty, coming up with his 
regiment at night after it had halted ; and was with it in several engage- 
ments of the spring campaign. June 22d he was injured by being 
struck on the right shoulder by the limb of a tree cut off by a shell ; 
and was sent to a general hospital for treatment, whence he was trans-

ferred, October 11th, 1864 After the injury, and while at the General 
Hospital, his heart difficulty grew worse. 

Examined in October, he was found to have severe palpitations, 
attended at times with nmch shortness of breath, and always worse at 
night, the violent beating interfering with his sleep. He also complained 
of pain over the heart following any exercise, and of occasional dizzi- 
ness with faintness. The pain in the cardiac region only existed on 
exertion. His appetite was good ; the bowels regular. The impulse of 
the heart was extended, very heavy, and forcible ; the first sound dull, 
prolonged, heavy ; the second indistinct, even at the base. The percus- 
sion-dullness of the heart measured five inches transversely ; four and 
seven-eighths perpendicularly, and five and a half obliquely, from its right 
upper edge to the apex. Though the impulse was very strong, it was not 
so strong as this great extent of percussion-dullness might imply. The 
pulse did not beat above seventy-eight, and was for a time reduced by 
aconite to between sixty and fifty-two. The man was made much 
more comfortable by treatment ; but, being unfit for active service, was 
finally placed in the Veteran Reserve Corps, Second Battalion. 

This case illustrates the physical signs of an hypertrophied 
heart, as well as the inconveniences it entails on the soldier, and in 
fact its common clinical history. Some fiirther symptoms may be 
found in this and the succeeding record. 

Case XXXIII. Hypertrophy of the Heart, much Cardiac Pain, Bleed- 
ing from the Gums and Lungs (Case-Book III., p. 138). — George W. 

F , private. Company B, 7th Michigan Volunteers, twenty-one years 

of age, a farmer before enlisting ; enlisted October 22d, 1863, for three 
years, being well and strong at the time. Had an attack of inflam- 
matory rheumatism three years prior to entering the service. Was on 
duty until January 1st, 1864, when he caught a severe cold, and on 
recovering from this the heart trouble supervened, manifesting itself 
chiefly by shortness of breath on exertion, and spitting of blood. After 
being transferred to various hospitals, he was sent to my wards. May 
26th, 1864. He was a healthy-looking man, five feet nine inches in 
height, of excellent habits, using neither tobacco nor spirituous liquors. 
His appetite was good ; the bowels regular ; the gums were spongy — 
occasionally they bled. The respiratory organs were healthy ; a trifling 
bronchitis forming the only exception to this statement. He had not 
then, nor had he had, any pains of a rheumatic character since enlisting, 
but was frequently annoyed by a sharp pain, strictly limited to the 
region of the heart. While quiet he had no palpitation ; had dyspnoea 
on exertion, and found it difficult to breathe in the recumbent posture. 
Exercise still caused bleeding from the lungs, either of pure blood, 
or, more generally, of blood mixed with mucus. The impulse was ex- 
tended and strong, and had in addition somewhat of a jerking stroke — 



3T2 HYPERTROPHY OF HEART. 

a character which the pulse, beating ninety-four to the minute, and 
forcible, did not share. The cardiac percussion-dullness was increased ; 
the first sound long, murmurish over left ventricle, but without real mur- 
mur ; the second sound distinct, yet not unnaturally so. The force and 
frequency of the impulse were considerably influenced both by aconite 
and aconitia, one thirtieth of a grain twice daily. And even the first 
sound became gradually less dull. The cardiac pain, however, per- 
sisted, and was at times noted to have been attended with soreness in 
the cardiac region. There was, however, no perceptible decrease in 
the cardiac diameters; and after several months of treatment, particular 
attention being paid to his diet, afler a return home on furlough, and a 
cessation of the bleeding for some time, the man was, in a much im- 
proved condition, placed in the Veteran Reserve, Battalion I. 

This patient presented as one of his symptoms spitting of blood ; 
and this phenomenon, scarcely encountered in hypertrophy of the 
heart seen in civil life, I have found to be not at all infrequent 
amons: soldiers. Now it occurs under various circumstances. In 
the majority it first makes its appearance after excessive exercise, 
especially after the fatigue and excitement of a hard contested 
battle, or after a forced march. In some, as in the case just re- 
ported, it is associated with marked signs of cardiac distress, and 
though often produced by exertion, did not originally set in as 
the immediate consequence of this. In either instance it may not 
or may be combined, as it was in Case XXXIII., with evidences 
of a scorbutic state of system. Nor would I wish the inference 
drawn that its occurrence is invariably linked to the existence of 
an enlarged heart. I have encountered it under circumstances 
similar to those mentioned, in soldiers who merely presented an 
irritable state of the organ. In some cases, though not in many, 
it was a mere coincidence with the noticing of cardiac symptoms, 
being really due to a blow, or to a fall from or with the horse 
— the latter the more common. Again, the hagmoptysis may 
happen without any connection with a persistent cardiac disorder, 
either organic or functional. For I met with instances in which 
soldiers had spat blood more or less profusely after a battle, 
or much exertion, in whom, when examined a few weeks after- 
wards, perfect regularity of the heart's action existed, and not a 
trace of disease of the lungs. The simple pulmonary congestion, 
probably associated with the temporarily excited circulation, had 
passed away. These hemorrhages do not recur, excepting it 
may be when the cause recurs. I may add that I had a num- 
ber of cases of these various forms of hagmoptysis for a long

line under observation, and not in one did any pulmonary trouble 
develop itself. Tims, then, hemorrhage from the lungs in soldiers 
happens often under circumstances unhke those in civil life, and 
has, with its dissimilar causes, both different consequences and a 
different meaning. 

But to return to the study of hypertrophy. AVhat were ob- 
served to be its causes ? The most frequent was per- Hypertrophy 
sistent functional disorder, especially that disorder which enTf^?'' 
I have described as irritable heart. But I shall have to orTerlan^ 
refer for the evidence of this to my paper on the sub- ^"*''' ^^^^"• 
ject. Very many cases originated after fevers ; at all events I 
could not discover, on the closest investigation, that they had had 
any cardiac symptoms whatever prior to the fever. But, not long 
after going back to duty, they were troubled with shortness of 
breath and palpitation, and presented, when examined by me — 
which, it is true, did not, as a rule, happen for some months sub- 
sequent to the development of the cardiac symptoms — the signs 
of hypertrophy. The explanation of this is not difficult. It is 
well known how often, in typhoid fevers — and it was particularly 
with reference to them that the observations were made — the 
cardiac structure undergoes changes. If a man with a heart in 
this condition, or rather not fully restored from this condition, be 
sent to duty, as not uncommonly happened ; if he take then much 
exercise, and keep up an excited action of the weakened organ, it 
is easy to see how hypertrophy, with more or less dilatation, will 
follow. It is true this explanation implies, as one of the causing 
elements, that continued functional disturbance will result in en- 
largement. But, as already stated, my experience on this point 
is so positive as to leave no doubt. 

In a certain sense also due to continued functional excitement 
were those cases which originated during or after heavy marching.^ 
They were by no means rare, and whether this be their true 
explanation or not, gave very distinctive histories. 

Case XXXIV. Hypertrophy of the Heart subsequent to Heavy 
Marching ; No Fever or preceding Derangement of Health (Case- 

1 I use the term marching not simply of the marching of infantry — which then would 
imply excessive exercise as pedestrians as the acting cause — but also of the marching of 
cavalry and artillery, in which branches of the service the upper extremities come more 
into play. I have met, indeed, with the kind of hypertrophy under discussion in all arms 
of the service; it is true, more frequently in infantry. But, considering their greater num- 
ber, this might well happen, without there being a greater absolute frequency. To deter- 
mine this point positively, would, however, require an investigation on the largest scale, 
on which, at the same time, the number of troops of each arm engaged in a campaign 
were accurately known. Data of this kind are not in my possession. 



374 HYPERTROPHY PRIOR TO ENLISTMENT. 

Book y., p. 39). — Nath. C , private, Company G, 1st Regiment 

Rhode Island Artillery, enlisted in August, 1862, and was very con- 
stantly on service for two years, doing much marching. He was a per- 
fectly healthy man before enlisting. He first noticed shortness of 
breath and pain in the side in April, 1864, and subsequently marched 
with his regiment from Brandy Station to Petersburg, and then to the 
Valley, part of the time accompanying the 6th Cavalry. In August he 
had an attack of diarrhoea, found his shortness of breath much increased, 
and so great that he could not march ; in consequence was sent to a hos- 
pital. He never had a fever. When he came under my charge some 
months afterwards, he was observed to have dilated hypertrophy. The 
impulse was one hundred and twenty-four, extended, moderately 
forcible ; first sound dull, rather heavy ; second sound not much 
altered, slightly increased. The transverse diameter of the heart was 
four inches; the longitudinal three and a half; the oblique four and 
seven eighths. The man was five feet nine inches in height, and 
had a well developed chest. He did not suffer much excepting on 
exertion.

Case XXXIII. Affection of the Beaj% prohably Hypertrophy, exist- 
ing prior to enlisting ; Aggravation of Symptoms subsequent to a Wound, 
strictly limited Soreness in Cardiac Region (Case-Book IV., p. 240). 

— Wm. H. L , private, Company I, 112th Pennsylvania Volunteers, 

aged twenty-nine, enlisted August 3d, 1863, for three years. Was, 
while in civil life, a harness-maker, and had been much troubled with 
restlessness, shortness of breath, and with occasional fainting spells, for 
a year before entering the service. He never could bear the double 
quick, being always obliged to fall out ; but he did duty regularly until 
June 3d, 1864, when he was wounded in the hand in an engagement at 
Cold Harbor, Virginia, having marched there from Front Royal with- 
out noticing palpitation, or being much annoyed by shortness of breath. 
While his wound was being treated at the hospital, marked attacks of 
palpitation occurred, accompanied by choking sensations, and at times 
by what appeared to him like a cessation of the impulse of the heart, 
when he felt as if without life enough to move or to make the least ex- 
ertion. These symptoms still existed when he was sent into my wards 
October 11th. He was also very restless, complaining much of ner- 
vousness. Any noise excited palpitation, likewise exertion of any kind, 
such as going up-stairs. Generally slept well, excepting when disturbed 
by fits of violent beating of the heart. Appetite was good ; bowels 
regular ; used tobacco, but no ardent spirits ; never had had rheu- 



HYPERTEOPHY AMENABLE TO TREATMENT. 375 

matism. The impulse was ninety-six, extended, rather forcible ; the 
first sound dull, the second not increased. Diameters of percussion- 
dullness were : Transverse, three and a half inches ; perpendicular, three 
and five eighths inches ; oblique, four and one eighth inches. Height, 
five feet nine inches ; circular width of chest, thirty-four and a quarter 
inches. Respirations, thirty-two in the minute. There was no con- 
stant cardiac pain, but he felt pain when the heart's action was much 
excited. Soreness, however, in the cardiac region was noted on sev- 
eral occasions ; was probably constant ; and corresponded to limits of 
dullness on percussion. At the upper limit of the dullness, it agreed 
precisely with the line which was drawn. 

In this case there svas no doubt of a previous cardiac disorder, 
vet the man did not suffer much from it, and appears to have done 
considerable duty until he was wounded and lost blood. In other 
cases there was comparatively slight trouble or even inconvenience, 
until the strength was much reduced by diarrhoea, or some other 
source of exhaustion. In other words, we have here a repetition 
of what was noticed when discussing valvular affections. The 
same explanation might be advanced to account even for the cases 
of enlargement originating seemingly in fevers. Yet I do not 
think, on analyzing my series carefriUy, that it holds good except 
for a limited number. . 

In thus examining into the causes of hypertrophy of the heart 
in soldiers, I have not mentioned the cases originating in connec- 
tion with valvular or pericardial diseases, or in consequence of 
affections of the lungs or kidneys, because, though they were met 
M^itli, they presented nothing different from what is constantly en- 
countered, and from what every observer is familiar with. Yet it 
may be stated that, excepting enlargements associated with valvu- 
lar diseases, illustrations of the causations mentioned were very 
rare. 

What becomes of cases of hypertrophy such as I have described 
in detail ? Do they recover ; or do they get rapidly p^ses of 
worse, and finally die, in consequence of secondary af- Soi?vaf- 
fections, which hypertrophy of the heart may induce ? I amenable 
did not see a death from it, either directly or indirectly ; 
but, on the other hand, I never saw an instance in which the 
disease had reached a very marked point, in which a cure was 
accomplished. Yet I think I have seen enlarged hearts decrease. 
I found the complaint amenable to treatment to a very high degree, 
and excellent health was enjoyed by those who, after the force of 
the action was reduced by means of treatment, lived regularly and

did no laborious work. The following cases, which I had an op- 
portunity of examining at long intervals, will confirm the opinion 
advanced. 

Case XXXVI. Hypertrophy of the Hearty prohably succeeding to 
Fever ; Quieting of the Action of the Heart under Treatment ; Persistence 
of the Hypertrophy when seen Twenty Months after Discharge, hut Lessen- 
ing of Signs of Enlargement. — Charles W. P , private, Company 

F, 2d Pennsylvania Artillery, aged nineteen, a farmer before entering 
the service, enlisted February 2d, 1864, for three years. Stated that he 
suffered occasionally from palpitation and pain for about five years prior 
to enlistment; otherwise was perfectly healthy. Had typhoid fever 
in March ; by May 15th was sent to rejoin his regiment, with which he 
remained until July 18th, but was on duty only part of the time, and 
could not keep up on the marches. Was sent to Division Hospital in 
July, and came into my wards, in Philadelphia, September 3d. The 
palpitations only became marked subsequently to the fever, which was 
followed by diarrhoea afler rejoining his regiment. Indeed, though 
he said that he had occasional palpitation prior to enlisting, it was very 
doubtful if by this he meant any thing more than that his heart beat 
more strongly on very active exertion ; for he was able to run without 
being put out of breath, and kept up well with the others when 
drilling on the double quick on first enlisting, and even until he had 
the fever. 

He was a temperate man, using neither ardent spirits nor tobacco ; 
of fine physique ; gums healthy ; digestive functions in excellent order ; 
much pain in cardiac region, almost constant, but subject to marked 
exacerbations. Impulse one hundred, extended and forcible ; first 
sound heavy, long, muffled ; second, distinct, but not sharp. Transverse 
diameter of percussion-dullness, four inches. 

After a treatment of seven months — the man having been recom- 
mended for the Veteran Reserve, 1st Battalion, but not mustered in — 
the impulse was reduced to seventy-eight ; still, however, forcible, and 
still felt in several intercostal spaces. The first sound, though yet 
rather heavy, was decidedly less lengthened than formerly, and there 
was far less palpitation. 

The man was discharged May 29th, 1865, having kept up his treat- 
ment — for the main part by aconite — more or less actively. He 
went home, and did little or no work, and I found him, December 
12th, 1866, as a conductor on one of our city railroad cars. He told 
me that he had held this situation for eight months, and that he had 
not any steady pain in the cardiac region, though occasionally a pain 
there annoys him for a day or two. He can even exercise freely with- 
out shortness of breath, though not so well as before enlisting. Exam- 
ining his heart, I perceived that the impulse was still rather forcible ; 



HYPERTROPHY UNDER TREATMENT. 377 

but it was regular, and only seventy-six in the minute. Both 
sounds were well marked ; the first was heavy. The transverse 
diameter of the heart was three and five eighths, the perpendicular 
three inches. 

In this case, then, a marked amelioration in both symptoms and 
signs took place, and continued for about twenty months after the 
treatment had been stopped. Nay, it appeared as if the enlarged 
organ had been absolutely reduced in. size. Without, hovs^ever, 
mooting this point, it is very certain that the patient's heart did not 
increase, and that he became more and more comfortable. It may 
be even argued, as just mentioned, that the heart diminished in 
size. But the evidence is, I admit, not wholly free from doubt ; for 
I am aware that an engorgement of the cavities of the heart, such 
as is often found in instances of hypertrophy in which the action is 
very forcible, may cause the percussion-dullness to be greater than 
when the action is much quieted. Though I do not think that so 
considerable a difference as was here fomid, can be thus explained. 

In another case (Case-Book V., p. 50), in which, however, 
the hypertrophy was much more decided, and which was, in fact, 
a most marked example of dilated hypertrophy — the percussion- 
dullness, in May, 1865, measured, in a transverse direction, four 
and one eighth inches ; in a perpendicular direction, three and 
seven eighths. The impulse was very extended and forcible, and 
when uncontrolled by medicine, one hundred and twenty. The 
man had no dropsy. He was but a short time under treatment ; 
since soon after he was admitted, the military hospital was broken 
up. In January, 1866, I came across him, and found him, though 
looking very well, still suffering from shortness of breath and palpi- 
tation, at times very violent. He had been unable to do any thing 
save the hghtest work. The impulse was very strong ; the first 
sound dull and heavy, and the cardiac percussion-dullness aug- 
mented ; transverse diameter four and three eighths, perpendicu- 
lar, four inches. 

Now, in this case, it is evident that the hypertrophy of the heart 
did not lessen, but increased, though the action of the heart became, 
perhaps, quieter ; and the general health of the patient, which, 
when he was first seen, was not very good, had become much 
better. The increase in the enlargement was probably due to the 
absence of treatment ; for the man, as already stated, was only for 
a brief period with us before he was discharged. 

In another case (Luther R , Case-Book I., p. 125), in which 

the history indicated that the cardiac enlargement followed an 



878 TREATMENT EMPLOYED IN THESE CASES. 

attack of so-called typho-malarial fever contracted on the Chicka- 
hominy, the patient, when he came into my hands, in June, 1863, 
while presenting the appearance of good health, showed, with the 
usual symptoms and signs of hypertrophy, a cardiac percussion- 
dullness of four and a half inches, transversely ; three and seven- 
eighths perpendicularly ; and four and seven-eighths obliquely to 
apex. The impulse was eighty-eight, and quite forcible ; respira- 
tions twenty-four. This patient having lost nearly all of his upper 
teeth subsequently to the fever, and being unfit for duty in the field, 
was, after he had been treated for a few months, detailed to do light 
duty as nurse, and acting as such, remained under observation for 
one year. The treatment, which consisted of various sedatives, 
but, towards the last, exclusively of aconite, was kept up with con- 
siderable regularity nearly this whole time ; and with the result 
that all sensitiveness in the cardiac region, at one time great, dis- 
appeared ; that he no longer had any palpitation except on active 
exertion ; and that, while the first sound remained heavy and pro- 
longed, and the impulse strong, accurate percussion of the heart 
indicated that the transverse diameter had decreased by one inch, 
the oblique by three eighths of an inch, while the perpendicular 
remained the same. I have heard from the man since his dis- 
charge ; he is unable to do any thing but light work on a farm, and 
still has strong beating of the heart. I received this report about 
one year after his discharge. Clearly he had hypertrophy of the 
heart ; clearly it persists ; but clearly, also, it was much benefited 
by treatment. 

As so great stress is laid on proper treatment, and as the results

abstinence from all agents, and avoidance of all causes, which excite 
the heart, was insisted upon, and as faithfully as can be done with 
soldiers, enforced. Where diarrhoea, or any digestive disturb- 
ances existed, or anaemia was present, these were, as far as pos- 
sible, removed ; in other words, every thing was done to prevent 
the heart's movements from being, or remaining frequent. And 
in each instance, attempts were made to control the further in- 
crease of the organ by agents which reduce its action. With 
this view, I tried digitalis, veratrum viride, aconite, gelseminum, 
belladonna, both internally and externally, and, in addition, many 
other articles. Nothing answered as well, as universally well, 
as aconite. But I had to learn that, to be successful with it, 



CASE OF INCIPIENT HYPERTROPHY. 379 

it must be given in a very different manner from what it has hith- 
erto been, and still usually is. It must be persevered in for months. 
My general plan was to administer one or two drops of a good tinct- 
ure twice or three times daily, and to go on without decreasing 
or increasing the dose until the impulse of the heart had become 
decidedly softer ; at the same time, usually, the pulse was lessened 
in frequency. Then the medicine was kept up in varying doses, 
always watching whether or not it produced the desired effect, or 
acted too much. It did not interfere with digestion, nor impair in 
the least the general health. And what, fearing its activity as a 
sedative, I commenced hesitatingly and doubtingly, I soon was 
taught to use fearlessly and sanguinely. I am certain that in 
a large number of cases, thus employed, the remedy prevented 
the further growth of the heart. Nay, I think that in some — and 
I have given the details of a few — it lessened the already increased 
bulk of the organ. But the last point is one to a great extent of 
opinion, for the differences in the physical signs may, as above men- 
tioned be, perhaps, explained in a different manner ; and, as I can- 
not prove my supposition by absolute demonstration, I shall not 
here further discuss it. But, as regards beginning cases of hyper- 
trophy, cases with already slight increase, cases standing as it were 
on, or just having passed the border line between functional dis- 
turbance and organic change, the influence of the di'ug is such as 
not, I think, to admit of doubt. 

Case XXXVII. Signs of beginning Hypertrophy following Func- 
tional Disturbance of the Heart ; their Disappearance under the use of AcO'

(Case-Book III., p. 100). — Henry B , private, Company B, 146th 

New T"ork Volunteers, age 22 years, by occupation when enlisted a clerk. 
Enlisted August 13th, 1862, for three years, being at that time in perfect 
health. Did duty with his regiment up to June 1st, 1863, when he was 
first affected with palpitation. After that could not drill or undergo 
any active exertion or do hard work, and was detailed as clerk for his 
captain. While on the march with his regiment, moving with the army 
toward Maryland and Pennsylvania, in the month of June, 1863, he 
fell in the ranks with a severe attack of palpitation. Unable after- 
wards to keep up with his regiment, he was always obliged to come up 
as a straggler after it had encamped. Yet he did not leave it until April 
30th, 1864, when, after being sent to various hospitals, he was directed 
to my ward in Philadelphia May 11th, 1864. He had at that time fre- 
quent palpitation and a sharp pain in the cardiac region ; an impulse 
forcible and extended ; a comparatively large area of percussion-dull- 
ness over the heart, though not one showing a very decided increase 
of the organ ; and a dull first sound. Pulse eighty. 



880 OF IRRITABLE HEARTS. 

He took for a week tincture of hyoscyamus 3ij twice daily, without 
any perceptible effect, and was then placed on a drop of a strong tinct- 
ure of aconite (two and a half times the strength of that officinal in the 
Pharmacopoeia) twice daily. 

May 20th. Impulse seventy-two ; not so many palpitations. Aco- 
nite three times daily. 

June nth. Has had several small hemorrhages from the lungs 
within the last two weeks, for which, while continuing the aconite, he 
has been taking aromatic sulphuric acid. A distinct, systolic blowing 
is perceptible in the second interspace on the left side. The impulse of 
the heart appears less extensive, and is markedly decreased in force ; 
seventy-two. Temporarily stops aconite, continues acid. 

June 30th. Had one slight attack of haemoptysis since last note. 
Blowing sound in pulmonary artery has almost disappeared, being no 
longer distinctly audible. Has had more palpitation. Impulse eighty. 
Resumes the strong tincture of aconite, two drops at night ; continues 
acid twice daily. 

July 6th. Impulse seventy-six ; still has occasionally palpitations ; 
acid stopped ; aconite given twice daily some days. 

July 26th. Impulse seventy-eight ; seems absolutely feeble — so 
much has its force been reduced. Treatment suspended. 

August 4th. Impulse eighty ; but has not resumed its excessive 
force. Only seldom, and then at night, active beating of the heart. 
Does now light duty as clerk. 

August 22d. Impulse seventy-two, not in the least forcible, nor 
is there any abnormal character of sounds. Man looks and feels 
well ; and, some time after this examination, returned to his regi- 
ment. 

The cases of hypertrophy that I have brought forward in this

stances of dilatation were very infrequent. I met with only a few, 
among upwards of a hundred examples of enlargement of the 
heart, uncomplicated with valvular disease. When encountered, 
they presented the usual symptoms of enfeebled action of the 
organ, with the well-known accompanying physical signs.

CONCLUSIONS. 881 

Yet the mass of cardiac disorders is not organic, but fiinctional. 
And of these again a very large proportion belong to the group 
which I have designated " irritable hearts." Elsewhere (^Medical 
Diagnosis) I have endeavored to depict the outlines of this curious 
malady ; and I intend to pubHsh a fuller nan-ative. To complete, 
however, this essay, and furnish a means of comparison, I will 
indicate very briefly the characters of the ailment. They are : 
great frequency of the action of the heart, constantly recurring 
attacks of palpitation, and pain in the praecordial region. The 
very rapid action of the heart is associated with an extended, not 
forcible, but an abrupt or jerky impulse, sometimes of irregular 
rliythm, and with a short first sound, and a very distinct second 
sound. The disorder is an extremely obstinate one, and much 
exercise is impossible ; the malady often exists when the general 
health is perfect. When present to a marked degree, it totally 
unfits the soldier for active duty — as much so as the worst 
organic disease. 

On bringing this inquiry into cardiac affections to an end, it is 
scarcely worth while to dwell on the lessons it incul- ^ , . 

Conclusions. 

cates. The cases speak for themselves. It has become 
apparent how underlying the development and aggravation of car- 
diac maladies are certain general laws, the recognition of which is 
of the deepest practical importance to the physician ; how the signs 
of merely disordered frmction are not to be slighted, since it may 
lead to organic disease ; how the amount of suffering and the ina- 
bility to exertion are often more in proportion to the extent of the 
disturbed function than of the structural change ; how little the 
cardiac malady may show itself or become a source of incon- 
venience as long as the general health remains good ; how quickly 
all deterioration of health reacts on the heart ; and how, after ex- 
hausting diseases, especially fevers, we should be careful not to 
permit over-exercise or sustained exertion. 

These points are alike important to the student of cardiac pa- 
thology in civil and in military fife. But there are some further 
questions here mooted which concern the latter alone. Ought 
an affection of the heart to be a disqualifying element for en- 
listing ? Ought it to become a cause for discharge ? Obviously 
it cannot be recommended to receive into the ranks men with any 
defect of the circulation. But the mere fact of a disorder of the 
heart existing ought not to be a cause for discharge. Some cases 
are curable, and others can do much miHtary duty, though it may 
not be the most active field service. If a nation engaged in war

military efficiency of those who have been long enough In the 
army to attain military efficiency, unless this be combined with 
perfect physique — then, of course. It had best at once restore to 
the field and workshops those whose frames are no longer free from

HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

It is within the last thirty years that the disease under notice 
has, for the first time, been scientifically described. Un-

der the various names oi " cerebro-spmal menmgitis, 
" spotted fever," " typhus syncopatis," " winter epidemic," " catar- 
rlial fever," " peripneumonia notha," " fidvre cdrebrale," and 
" c^phalalgie epidemique," it has been more or less known for a 
longer period. Each of these various titles is in some sense de- 
scriptive ; but the first is the only one which can be considered 
classical, or based upon a true appreciation of the pathology. 

Says Mr. Simon : " In 1837, when its importance first began to 
be recognized in France, few previous epidemics of the disease 
were on record." Yet it had been more or less known before that 
time. In Geneva, in 1805, it killed thirty-three persons, and from 
that time on it has been occasionally described. Yet there can be 
no doubt that, as an epidemic, — and in that respect to be distin- 
guished from ordinary meningeal inflammations, — it has existed 
from the earliest periods of medical record. Dr. S. G. Webber, 
of Boston, in the erudite essay to which was awarded the Boyl- 
ston Prize for the year 1866, very clearly establishes its identity 
with epidemics chronicled in Europe as far back as 1480 ; while 
an epidemic occurring in 1503 can be readily recognized as the 



384 PREVALENCE IN AMERICA. 

same fi'om the descriptions given of the symptoms. " Fi^vre c^r<^" 
brale " was the name then assigned to it ; and, under that and simi- 
lar designations, it has made frequent appearances upon the records 
of epidemics. In some descriptions of jail or hospital fever, such as 
that by Sir John Pringle, in 1752, it is pretty clear that this 
enemy to life was the real subject of study. 

With the increase of medical publications, we find this disease, 
or something which does not much vary fi'om it in the prominent 
symptoms, recorded frequently ; and it would encroach too much 
upon our space to specify the particular epidemics. In all of them 
we find no contradiction to the continuous statement of a disease 
distinctly, but not extensively, epidemic ; suddenly appearing, and 
as suddenly passing away ; having its habitat in malarial localities, 
or where crowd-poison was present ; attracting attention and ex- 
citing profomid alarm by the violence of its cerebral symptoms ; 
and, finally, presenting at all times — and not less now than in 
former years — a frightful percentage of mortahty. 

No country in Europe or in North America, open to intelligent 
medical observation, has escaped this infliction. The lo- 
calities that have been distinguished by its most severe 
invasions, during the present century, are Geneva in 1805 ; among 
the Spanish prisoners at Briangon in 1807 ; in the sick of the 
French army at Grenoble in 1814, after the hardships of crossing 
the Alps in winter; and in the Parisian hospitals at the same 
time ; during the winters of several years (1813, 1814, and 1815) 
in Ireland ; in Millbank Penitentiary, near London, in 1823 ; 
among the galley slaves at Toulon in the winter of 1829-30 ; in 
numerous barracks in France in 1837, and continuing for several 
years to be mostly confined to the military ; extending its ravages 
to civil life at Strasbourg in 1841 ; from which time its appear- 
ances are too numerous to quote, it having become a well recog- 
nized disease, although by far the best study of it that has met our 
eye is that made in 1865 by Dr. John Burdon Sanderson on the 
Lower Vistula, in Northern Germany, wdiither he w^as despatched 
on a tour of investigation by ZJr. John Simon, the distinguished 
medical officer of the Privy Council of Great Britain. 

In America it has occurred, mostly in the winter season, in the

tinctly malarial. It has also happened on shipboard in association 
with hardships and confinement between decks. With reference 



FAVORED BY COLD, OVERCROWDING, ETC. 385 

to our present purpose of study — to learn how far this disease 
may be connected with mihtary hygiene — we find it developing 
itself, especially in the winter of 1863-64, in the army, and also in 
the succeeding winter. Its most frequent habitat was in over- 
crowded military hospitals, in cantonments for recruits, and in 
military prisons. Epidemics occurred especially at Benton Bar- 
racks, Missouri, at Newbern, N. C, and at the Penitentiary at 
Little Rock, Ark. ; while at numerous other posts we find records 
of its occasional prevalence. 

In the Confederate army it was witnessed in the army of 
Northern Virginia, near Fredericksburg, in April, 1863 ; in Ken- 
tucky in the winter of 1861-62 ; and near Mobile in the closing 
winter of the war. 

The frequent mention of prisons in the above statement will at 
once attract attention. The observation of our army surgeons, 
North and South, will confirm the proposition that cerebro-spinal 
meningitis is not peculiarly a disease of the camp or the campaign. 
It sometimes occurred in tents, but most fi:equently in permanent 
cantonments, and where masses of troops were aggregated, or in 
the various prisons. 

At Little Rock, Ark., the writer saw it in the winter of 1864-65. 
Some cases occurred in the camp of a Missouri regiment occurrence 
which was living in stockaded tents, many of which were Rock "^ 
damp, ill-ventilated, and, from long occupancy, sur- ^^"^^^s^^- 
charged with organic matter in process of decay. At the same 
time a considerable number of deaths occurred in the Penitentiary, 
two miles distant from the camp mentioned. This penitentiary 
was overcrowded with Confederate prisoners. Surrounded by a 
high stone wall, and itself built of solid masonry, it had very insuf- 
ficient latrines, and was damp and chilly throughout. All forms 
of zymotic disease prevailed there, including typhoid fever and 
small-pox. The cerebro-spinal meningitis showed itself in the 
form of a small, compact epidemic, and disappeared after about 
twelve deaths occurred. All cases were fatal. 

At Benton Barracks, near St. Louis, Mo., fifty cases were ob- 
served by Surgeon Ira Russell during the winter of occurrence 
1863-64. Dr. Russell says : "At that time the weather BarrackT 
was extremely cold; the men were huddled together in over 
crowded barracks, and subjected to all the moral and physical in- 
fluences incident to a change from a life of servitude to one of 
freedom and military service." In another report Surgeon Rus- 
sell details at length the conditions to which these unfortunate 

25 



386 EPIDEMIC ON THE LOWER VISTULA. 

men (escaped or emancipated slaves) were subjected. The bar- 
racks occupied by tliem were inferior to the cavahy stables near 
by, and were most imperfectly heated ; while the commissariat and 
clothing supply was deficient. As in the epidemic at Little Rock, 
zymotic diseases were veiy prevalent, coincident and frequently 
complicated with the meningeal disease. 

In the winter of 1862-63, a severe epidemic occurred at New- 
Occurrence hcm, N. C, which has bccu ably described by Surgeon 
NoSrcaro-' J* Baxtcr Upham. It was confined mostly to the 44th, 
Una. 45th, and 51st Massachusetts, and the lOtli Connecticut, 

regiments, all of which occupied barracks. The epidemic tendency 
extended, however, to troops living in tents to a small degree. 
The regiments most afilicted occupied barracks located on a 
" sandy and sterile plain, elevated perhaps five or six feet above 
the level of the river. The 44th, which suffered most, was nearest 
the bank ; quite near the camp lay a couple of marshy bogs, small 
in extent, through which flowed a sluggish stream to the river." 
Of the barracks. Dr. Upham says : " They were made of green 
stuff — hard pine mostly — the logs being taken newly cut from 
the forest or drawn out from the water, where they had been 
lying for a few weeks, sawn into joists and boards, and used in the 

fabrication of all parts of the building Thus constructed, 

they were necessarily cold and damp." They were also much 
overcrowded, with imperfect ventilation and scanty heating ap- 
paratus. 

In April, 1863, four cases occurred in a single tent of the 22d 
Occurrence North Carolina regiment (Confederate), near Fredericks- 
erlcksbuj, b^^g? ^a. They were reported by Surgeon P. Gervais 
^*" Robinson. Three of these cases died, all being from one 

family of conscripts. The fourth tent-mate, an old soldier, recov- 
ered. Dr. Robinson says, that " it is difficult to define any special 
circumstances affecting this tent in preference to others." 

In February, 1863, eight cases, of which six were fatal, occurred 
in the 3d Alabama (Confederate). We are not informed of the 
character of the camp, but suppose it to have been one of consider- 
able exposure. The season was severely cold. 

Turning to the epidemic on the Lower Vistula (Northern Ger- 
sanderson's many), iu 1865, we find Dr. Sanderson reporting a veiy 
«;pidemicon insufficient vcutilation in the cottages where it prevailed; 

the Lower i i i i 

Vistula. and he adds : — 

" The want of house drainage and of any appliance for the collection 
and deposit of excreta, is another condition which (especially in a 



SYMPTOMS. 387 

marshy district) must, no doubt, exercise a deteriorating effect upon all 
the inhabitants ; but as the evil is universal, as every peasant defecates 
in the open air in the immediate neighborhood of his cottage, it would 
be absurd to attribute any special significance to the fact." 

These statements, which are not contradicted by any other facts 

within our knowledge, go to show that cerebro-spinal The disease 

meningitis has its favored habitat in cold, damp, and over- coui and 

» ^ , Till ^^*^'^ crowd- 

crowded tenements ; preferrmg prisons and barracks, and ing. 

being most fatal in those locahties. The winter is the season in 
which these anti-sanitary conditions are most easily developed ; 
but there seems to be another element of causation in a low tem- 
perature. It is especially a disease of the winter season. We 
have observed it (in civil life) in the summer, but our records con- 
line us almost entirely to the winter months. 

Dr. Sanderson's record of the epidemic on the Lower Vistula, 
shows that of three hundred and forty-seven deaths, three Age and con- 
hundred and eighteen were of children under fourteen those'"''^^ 
years of age. As to sex, one hundred and sixty-four ^^^^'^^'i- 
were males, and one hundred and fifty-four females. The sex of 
those over fourteen is not mentioned. We quote these statistics as 
far more valuable for generalization than any that can be furnished 
by an army ; inasmuch as military life excludes the questions of 
sex and of childhood. Our statistics do not enable us to give ac- 
curate tables of the age and condition of those who were attacked 
in the army during the rebelHon ; but we feel safe to assert that 
cerebro-spinal meningitis, both in military and in civil practice, 
selects its victims from the young and the vigorous, preferring the 
strongest and most robust constitutions to the feeble and broken. 

Dr. Upham says of the Newbern epidemic : " The subjects of 
this disease, in most cases, were those previously in the fullness of 
robust health, — between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four, — 
who had endured hardships and exposures with impunity." 

SYMPTOMS. 
Usually, the premonitions of cerebro-spinal meningitis are brief 
and uncertain. The patient has been usually found in premoni- 
good health up to the moment of attack. In some few *^*"'^- 
cases, which remind us of idiopathic meningitis, there is a prelude 
of nausea or causeless vomiting, and in some rare cases there is 
headache for some days previously. On this point. Dr. Upham 
says : " The disease w^as commonly sudden and without premoni- 
tion, the patient, for the most part, continuing on duty and making 
no complaints till the very day of his seizure." 



THE INTELLECT AFFECTED. 

Dr. Eussell says of the Benton BaiTacks epidemic : " The first 
patients brought to the hospital were in a dying state ; those bring- 
ing them reporting that a few hours previously they were well, and 
insisting that they had been poisoned. Dr. Russell, however, found, 
on close investigation, that the onset of serious symptoms had usu- 
ally been preceded by a period of malaise, lasting from three to 
eight days. It is, nevertheless, a prominent fact that there is usu- 
ally nothing diagnostic in whatever prelude there may be, and that 
sudden, violent, and uncontrollable attack is one of the character- 
istics of the onset. The premonitory symptoms are very rarely, 
if ever, sufficient to provoke a call for medical assistance. 

Vomiting is a characteristic symptom of the period of invasion. 
Period of ^^ i^ usually violent and obstinate to treatment, and con- 
invasion. tiuucs for scvcral hours. Severe headache is synchronous 
w^ith the vomiting ; the pain, at first, being usually referred to the 
whole head. Not unfrequently a chill ushers in the grave symp- 
toms. It may be slight, but is sometimes profound, assuming the 
appearance of the congestive chill of pernicious intermittent. In 
these cases the chill merges at once into delirium or coma. 

As a rule the nausea and vomiting are the first prominent signs, 
and they are very speedily followed by a peculiar stiffiiess in the 
muscles of the back and neck, or by intense localized pains some- 
where in the same region, or, perhaps, referred to the shoulder 
or arm. In some cases the initiatory symptom has been paralysis 
of the tongue or muscles of the face. The headache and pain are 
attended by great restlessness, and delirium speedily follows. Fever 
sets in, the face is usually flushed, the heat of the body is aug- 
mented as shown by the thermometer, though the sensations may 
still remain chilly ; the conjunctiva is red and injected, the pupils of 
the eyes are most frequently dilated though sometimes contracted, 
and the muscles of the nucha are contracted. From this point on 
it will be more convenient to study the leading symptoms indi- 
vidually. 

From the period of invasion the intellect becomes affected. The

teiiect. condition is that of partial coma, the patient being capable 

of being roused and of comprehending questions. In other cases 
the delirium is violent, and the patient needs coercive control ; but 
the general rule will be a condition of muttering, talkative delirium, 
without much physical exertion. The violent form of delirium is 
usually rapidly fatal, and may continue until the moribund condi- 
tion, when it is succeeded by a brief period of coma, which is a 
part of the process of death. 



MUSCULAR CONTRACTION. — PAIN. 389 

Again, the delirium often merges into a state of apathy or com- 
)lete indifference to external impressions. Dr. Sanderson remarks, 
in several children whom he saw, the general state of the 

itient was very similar to that of tubercular meningitis, and that 

was impossible to distinguish them from cases of that disease. 

'he order of the succession of the intellectual disturbances, is first 

^the tendency to mutter in a dreamy way, and following that a 

coma, usually not profound, which deepens into dissolution by 

death, or may gradually give way to recovery. 

The delirium, whether violent or muttering, is accompanied, and 
often preceded, by that characteristic symptom, a con- Muscular 
traction of the muscles of the neck. In Germany, this ^o^t'^^^'ion. 
feature has given the popular name to the disease (Nackenstarre), 
and it may be considered as pathognomonic when associated with 
disturbance of the intellect. Dr. Sanderson attributes this con- 
traction to pain, and not to spasm. He says : " The muscles of 
the back of the neck become the seat of exquisite pain, and in 
consequence the patient, by a half voluntary effort, throws back 
his head, in the same way as a person affected with other forms of 
myalgia." This does not agree with American, and especially with 
army observation, which almost uniformly speaks of " spasm " and 
" opisthotonos " being present. Dr. Webber says of this, tliat even 
under the influence of chloroform it is impossible to straighten the 
body. Again, numerous allied symptoms are exhibited which 
prove to us, conclusively, that the muscular contraction is a true 
tonic spasm. Strabismus, occasionally trismus without any other 
tetanic symptom, paralytic deglutition, and inward curvature of 
the thumbs and great toes — some or all of these are so frequently 
present, usually followed by opisthotonos, that all questions as to 
whether this is spasm or a voluntary posture seem decided. 

Pain, however, is a symptom of great importance. It is often 
localized, usually at first in the nape of the neck, but fre- 
quently in the spine. Sometimes it assumes the form of 
colic, or of intense rheumatic twinges in the muscles, perhaps of 
the abdomen, or of the extremities. This pain is rarely dull. It 
is agonizing. Closely connected with it is a hyperaesthesia, large 
portions of the surface becoming exquisitively sensitive, so that 
when touched or handled the patient screams. All motion is intol- 
erable, and even when the patient seems plunged in a profound 
insensibility, the attempt to move him calls out the most painful 
semi-articulate cries of suffering. At the same time, and without 
regard to the pain of motion, we find restlessness a constant and 



S90 TEMPERATURE, PULSE, ETC. 

prominent symptom. Early in the disease, his constant search for a 
new position exhausts himself and his attendants, and the restless- 
ness continues even after he has become incapable of turning in 
bed. In convalescence, we find hyperaesthesia still present, and 
only disappearing with the other evidences of cerebral disturbance. 
This, like the other symptoms, is peculiar. From the time the 
nape-pain commences, the head is thrown back, and the 

Decubitus. . -^ ,. 1 . . 1 -TIP 1 

patient lies upon his side, with the race upturned toward 
the head-board. As opisthotonos increases, or as, perhaps, the 
thighs become flexed upon the abdomen, the lateral posture is the 
only one possible, the sufferer constantly returning to it from his 
frequent efforts to find relief elsewhere. 

Great importance has been attached to the petechial eruption ; 
so much that, in the northern and eastern States, the 
chsease bears the popular name of " spotted fever," and 
many observers see in it only a peculiarly malignant form of 
typhus. At another stage of this argument, we shall further 
allude to this symptom, with a view to determine whether cerebro- 
spinal meningitis is a fever or a phlegmasia, a contagious or a non- 
contagious disease — a point of great hygienic importance. 

For the present it will suffice to say that petechias are not con- 
stant, the body frequently assuming a uniform dusky or livid hue 
of capillary congestion. When present they appear early — in the 
majority of cases on the first day — and vary in size from a mere 
red point to a diameter of an inch. Lying even wdth the surface, 
they are permanent on pressure, occurring most frequently on the 
legs and body, but often found on the arms. In American statis- 
tics they are mentioned as present in about one third of the cases 
which are tolerably well recorded. As a negative fact, it is im- 
portant to mention that Dr. Sanderson makes no allusion whatever 
to petechias in his report fi'om the Lower Vistula, a paper other- 
wise remarkable for accui'ate study. It is to be inferred that he 
does not consider them a symptom of the disease. 

The febrile condition is not marked, though there is a uniform 
Tempera- iucrcasc of the natural temperature, attended by exacer- 
^ure,pu , i^jj^^jQj^g during the periods of pain. 

The pulse is accelerated most in the early stage of the disease. 
As a guide to judge the severity of the disease it has little value. 
It varies in the same case from hour to hour. It is generally over 
ninety, but may suddenly fall much below, and alternately rise 
above, that number, without apparent relation to the progress of 
the disease. In character it uniformly gives evidence of deficient

arterial tension. Intermission or irregularity is not often ob- 
served. 

The respiration partakes of the same uncertainty as the pulse, 
being rapid or slow without reference to other symptoms. But it 
is always embarrassed in strict relation to the gravity of the case, 
and we find the inspmition laborious and prolonged. It is the 
same form that we notice in typhoid patients who are tending 
toward coma. 

The tongue is sometimes covered with a white, creamy coat, but 
is more often dry, and assumes toward the last a brown fur. 
Herpetic eruptions occur about the lips. 

The bowels are commonly sluggish, and there is nothing charac- 
teristic in the stools. Dr. Upham remarks that diarrhoea setting in 
late in the disease often points to a fatal termination. 

Swellings and abscesses occasionally appear in the progress of the 
disease or during convalescence. 

Strabismus, usually internal, is often present. The conjunc- 
tivae are injected, and in some instances small ecchymoses phenomena 
occur in them. The iris follows the same law as in other °^ ^^^'°'^- 
forms of meningitis, being either natural or contracted during the 
acute stage, and dilated and fixed after the period of effusions. In 
some recorded instances of recovery, total blindness was found to 
have been produced by inflammatory action in the posterior cham- 
ber of the eye, resulting in opalescence of the lens and atrophy 
of the eyeball. Iritis has also been observed, resulting in suppu- 
ration and loss of sight. 

In like manner, deafness is sometimes present firom the onset, or 
may be developed during the progress of the disease. It Deafness, 
is sometimes permanent.

at the same time is augmented, the record being in the neigh-

As the breathing becomes a mere exhausted flutter, the pulse will 
be found to be as high as 140. The heart continues to beat for a 
few moments after the last expiration. 

The above analysis of symptoms will be incomplete without 
some attempt to give a coup d'ceil of this terrible dis- General

always presents two stages or conditions. The first is a period of

wretchedness, in whicli the tortured organs of sense and conscious- 
ness express the keenest forms of pain and restlessness, and of 
mental hallucination and delirium, rapidly plunging the miserable 
man into the horrors of convulsion or tetanus, until we find him 
with eyes fixed or squinting, with the head thrown back, the body 
in opisthotonos, and the thighs flexed upon the belly, panting, 
sweating, moaning, or shrieking with pain. 

The second stage is more mercifid. The organs of the brain 
have succumbed under the pressure of effusion, and the exhausted 
body lies comatose and paralyzed. The pain, the muscular con- 
traction, the restlessness, the extreme debility — these are the 
fixed quantities of the disease. All other phenomena are com- 
paratively non-essential in the diagnosis. 

DURATION AND MORTALITY. 

Of several hundred fatal cases, the records as to the period of 
death are so imperfect that we are only able to speak 
with positiveness in one hundred and sixty cases. Of 
this number twelve, or one in thirteen, died within the first 
twenty-four hours ; ninety-two, or more than half, died before the 
close of the fifth day ; fourteen, or one in eleven, died before the 
close of the tenth day ; four, or one in forty, before the close 
of the fifteenth day ; and eighteen survived for various periods 
thereafter. The deaths on the second, third, fourth, and fifth 
days are pretty equally distributed. It will be seen that sixty-five 
per cent, of the deaths occur within the first five days. That 
period past, the chances of the patient improve. 

Of the duration of the cases of recovery it is unnecessary to 
speak. The attempts made to establish a probable period of con- 
valescence have only resulted in proving that recoveries are slow 
as a general thing, and that there is no law other than the very 
uncertain periods that may be required for the removal of what- 
ever deposits of exudation may have been made upon the menin- 
ges. The result is, that the epoch of convalescence is at any point 
of time from three days to three months. 

Dr. Webber, from a smaller number of cases, reaches the same 
conclusions. He says : " If a patient lives beyond the sixth day, 
there is some chance of recovery, less than one sixth having died 
after that time. The most fatal period is from the second to the 
fifth day, more than half dying then." 

Of seven hundred and thirteen cases which we have collated 
with some degree of accuracy, we exclude three hundred and forty- 



POST-MORTEM APPEARANCES. 893 

seven as being records of deaths only, and not capable of com- 
parison. We have left three hundred and sixty-six cases, 

11 „ , 1 111 Mortality. 

which present all the data necessary to deduce the aver- 
age rate of mortality in cases attacked. Most of them are from 
military life, and include all the recoveries as well as the deaths. 
The following is the result : — 

Cases. Deaths Recoveries- Per Cent, of Deaths. 

366 243 123 70. 

It will be seen that this ranks as one of the most uncontrollably 
fatal diseases, and that the resources of modern science save no 
more cases than recovered three centuries ago. 

POST-MORTEM APPEARANCES. 

The vast importance of a clear comprehension of the essential 
pathology of a disease of such fatality, is sufficiently evident. For- 
tunately, the post-mortem records to which we have access are so 
harmonious in their agreement upon the appearances presented 
after death, that there seems to be but little need for argument. 
It is, however, necessary to premise that we exclude from our re- 
search two cases reported by Dr. Upham at Newbern, which seem 
to us to have been deaths from other disease. They are cases 
numbers two and twelve, in his able monograph, published in Bos- 
ton in 1863. A reference to the bijou in question will, we think, 
excuse their omission. 

Of sixty-eight autopsies, the records of which we have examined, 
all present positive evidence, not only that the meninges of the 
brain and spinal cord were the localities of inflammatory disease, 
but that the sufferers died from that inflammation, and not from 
any intercurrent or other disease which might cloud the discussion 
of the essential cause of death. The appearances in other organs 
were mostly negative. As most of the patients had been healthy 
up to the hour when headache and nape-pain appeared, so we find 
their organs after death exhibiting trivial signs of disease. A few 
typical autopsies will sufficiently exhibit this ; and we shall then 
proceed to analyze them all with reference to other lesions which 
otherwise might be regarded as an integral part of the disease. 

Surgeon Joseph Jones, Confederate Army, observed several 
cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis at Augusta, Georgia, just before 
the close of the civil war. One of these, presenting the usual 
phenomena during the progress of the disease, furnishes the fol- 
lowing careftil post-mortem examination. The duration of the

The pia mater was greatly congested ; and the larger veins and 
many of the arteries were greatly distended with dark blood. 

The pons varolii, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord, were coated 
with a firm, light greenish-yellow, wax-like, fibrinous exudation ; 
large tracts of the cerebrum and cerebellum were also thinly coated 
with this effusion, which also surrounded the cauda equina and 
most of the roots of the spinal nerves, up to their entrance into the 
dura mater of the spinal cord. 

This exudation possessed various degrees of consistency, from 
that of a serous fluid to a newly-formed membrane, and differed in 
thickness in different portions of the spinal axis. The exudation 
at the base of the brain, where it covered the pons varolii and me- 
dulla oblongata, was of considerable thickness and firmness, and 
extended laterally, gradually diminishing in thickness, to the con- 
volutions of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Over these organs the 
deposit was much thinner and less consistent. 

When a section of the brain was made, so as to expose the ven- 
tricles, the third and lateral ventricles were found filled, and even 
distended, with a fight greenish-yellow, semi-fluid exudation, re- 
sembling, to the naked eye, pus. The optic thalami and striated 
bodies, with the walls generally of the ventricles, were coated with 
a layer of semi-organized plastic lymph. This deposit was sub- 
jected to a careful microscopic examination, resulting as follows : — 

Under the microscope, the exudation presented different stages 
of organization and development, from the simple granule to the 
perfected fibre, and even fibrous tissue. Although resembling pus 
to the naked eye, the exudation possessed a higher organization, 
and the more solid portions were rapidly passing into fibrous tissue. 

These facts struck me as of importance, in that they connected 
this disease with other forms of inflammation, as pleuritis and peri- 
tonitis ; and also explained the great difficulties that lie in the way 
of recovery from an inflammation of the nutritive membranes of 
organs essential to life, surrounded by a bony case. The present 
case had persisted for two weeks, and the results of the autopsy

indicated that the intensity of the inflammatory process had ceased, 
and much of the effused material was becoming organized. The 
mere presence of this material, from the very structure of the 
organs involved, and their bony envelope, must give rise to various 
morbid nervous phenomena, and, by pressure upon the nervous 
centres, give rise to irremediable disturbances in the muscles and 
organs to which their nerves are distributed. 

[Dr. Jones proceeds to give at length the post-mortem appear- 
ances in the other organs. Their evidence is negative, ^ote by the 
He says : " The liver contained grape sugar, which I '^o^p^'^'^- 
have shown to be absent from the liver of malarial fever." The 
organs of the thorax and abdomen may be said to have been healthy, 
or so nearly so as to present no evidence that they had shared in 
producing the fatal result. The liver and spleen were microscop- 
ically examined.] 

The following points are established by the investigations in this 
case of cerebro-spinal raeninmtis : — commen- 

1. There was no complication with malarious disease. Jones. 

2. The products of the inflammatory action resemble in all re- 
spects those of pleuritis and peritonitis. 

3. The inflammatory action appeared to be confined chiefly to 
the pia mater, involving, to a certain extent, also, the arachnoid. 

4. The nervous elements of the brain, spinal cord, and cervical 
nerves, (ganglionic cells, commissures, nerve tubes, and nervous 
connective tissue,) appeared to be free from mflammatory action. 

5. If the nervous elements were primarily involved in cerebro- 
spinal meningitis, it would be impossible to explain the suddenness 
and violence of the symptoms, and the rapid fatal result in the ab- 
sence of all lesions recognizable to microscopic investigation. On 
the other hand, it can be readily conceived that the inflammation 
of the nutritive membrane, and the coating of the most delicate 
organs confined in a bony case, with a dense exudation tending 
to organize itself progressively into more firm and resisting struct- 
ure, might give rise to all the phenomena of cerebro-spinal menin- 
gitis. 

6. This case furnishes an explanation of the very fatal character 
of this disease, as well as of the tedious nature of its recoveries. 
Even after the subsidence of inflammatory action in the meninges, 
the most serious consequences may follow, and all the dangers of 
the essential functions of life may be kept up by the mere mechan- 
ical action of the fibrous effusion. The period of convalescence 
from this disease would depend not only on the amount of effii-

si on, but also on the character and rapidity of the subsequent 
changes. 

7. The disease appeared to have been produced In this patient 
by the same causes which are active in the production of other in- 
flammatory affections, as peritonitis, pleuritis, pneumonia, and acute 
rheumatism ; namely, exposure, cold, damp weather, and the hard- 
ships of camp life. 

8. In its essential nature this case differed from a contagious 
malignant fever. There was not a single fact developed by the 
post-mortem examination that would justify the classification of 
this disease with the Pyrexiae. If cerebro-spinal meningitis be- 
longs to the class of the febrile diseases, then pneumonia, pleuritis, 
and acute peritonitis should, in like manner, be stricken from the 
list of the Phlegmasiae. 

In commenting on the preceding extended and exhaustive report 
Comments Taud wc havc becu compelled to somewhat curtail its

compiler. minutencss of detail), we see, first, that this was a 
typical case of cerebro-spinal meningitis ; that it was epidemic in 
character, being one of a number of simultaneous cases ; that the 
period of death was deferred until all the phenomena had time for 
development ; that the autopsy was thorough and conscientious ; 
and, finally, that its subsequent study and illustration are worthy 
of full confidence. 

Accepting this, then, as a type of the epidemic form of cerebro- 
spinal meningitis, it is only necessary to inquire in how much other 
records in our possession may be contradictory of this case. 

The theory which Dr. Jones seeks to estabhsh is, briefly, that 
cerebro-spinal meningitis is not a fever, but a local inflammation ; 
that it is not contagious ; that therefore we may allow it contact in 
hospital wards with other patients ; and, finally, that all our hygi- 
enic efforts may be directed to its original and not its secondary cau- 
sation — because the latter does not exist. We turn, therefore, to 
other records of autopsies to find whether those diseases which 
have been considered allied to epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, 
such as typhus, typhoid, and " peripneumonia notha," appear in 
the jjost-mortem examinations. 

Dr. Webber, in his Boylston Prize Essay of 1866, divides cerebro- 
Dr. Web- spiual meningitis into three orders. In the first the ce- 
Sn into^^^ rcbro-spiual system is affected ; in the other two it is not. 
three orders, \yithout reminding this able essayist, to whom we are 
much indebted, that he may be accused of a classification on the 
Ulcus a non lueendo principle, we quote his statement of the condi- 
tions of the two latter varieties : — 



DR. EUSSELL'S OBSERVATIONS. 397 

" II. In the second, or pneumonic form, there is less disturbance of 
the cerebral functions ; delirium is wanting, though headache mai/ exist. 
^— With great debility are found the symptoms, rational and physical, of 
^■pneumonia. Petechias occur. Opisthotonos is not unusually met with. 
Only two cases of this form occurred among those recorded ; both re- 
covered ; both exhibited petechiae." 

I Two cases of petechial pneumonia, in whicli delirium was want- 
ing, and headache is the only recorded cerebral symptom, while 
both recovered, can hardly be considered as within the range of 
i^his essay. As to the third variety he says : — 
" III. The third variety is marked by an absence of all the peculiar 
local symptoms ; having the debility, the petechiae, and complications. 
Two cases occurred : one with suppuration of both parotids, the other 
with great swelling, and excessive tenderness of the right knee ; both 
were without cerebral symptoms ; both recovered." 

We must again conclude, that two cases, in which no cerebral 
symptoms appeared, were not cerebro-spinal meningitis, and this 
refinement of classification is due to an orimnal error in the mate- 
rial from which the essay was compiled. Excepting these four, the 
two hundred and forty-nine cases included in the tables of Dr. 
Webber, seem to have been genuine. The four mistakes do not 
affect his records of autopsies. Of these he says : " In the lungs, 
the only lesion which is at all general, is a congested state," which 
he ascribes to hypostasis. " Sometimes there is a thick deposit of 
lymph upon the pericardium, and sometimes the same substance is 
to be found in one of the cavities," — a fact important as a possible 
metastasis. The other appearances he enumerates are in no man- 
ner logically connected with the disease in question, unless we ex- 
cept his mention of petechiae upon the peritoneum. 

Surgeon Ira Russell, U. S. Volunteers, who had, and improved, 
excellent opportunities for observing this disease in Ben- Dr. RusseU's 
ton Barracks, St. Louis, Mo., gives seven post-mortem tious"^^' 
examinations. In one of these he mentions splenic enlargement 
and fatty liver ; in a second, softened mucous membrane of the 
stomach and congestion of both lungs ; in a third, slight pleuritis 
and slight inflammation of the left lung ; in a fourth, lymph cov- 
ered the left pleura, and the left lung was in gray hepatization 
with the liver engorged ; and, in a fifth case, the whole intestinal 
mucous membrane was softened. In two cases lumbrici were 
found, a reminder of the French records of early epidemics, when 
this parasite was considered a cause of the disease. 

The cases coming under Dr. Russell's observations, were pecul-

iarly malarial ; yet we find in two of his cases tliat no complication 
was present. Those complications that were exhibited are phleg- 
masise, or else chronic disease, and none of them indicate any of 
the known forms of febrile disease. 

Among nineteen autopsies reported by Surgeon Upham as occur-

In one case, apoplectic points in the lung, the spleen double the 
usual size, and Peyer's patches more prominent than usual, with 
ulcerative points in one gland ; " not having, however, the legiti- 
mate appearance recognized in typhoid fever." In a second case, 
the lungs were tubercular, with apoplectic spots, the liver enlarged, 
and the spleen twice the usual size. In a third case, which lived 
nearly a month, Peyer's patches were very much thickened, and, 
in one or two instances, ulcerated. In a fourth case (Case XII.), 
there is no evidence of cerebro-spinal meningitis. The patient 
died suddenly, comatose. The brain was found softened, and the 
liver in fatty degeneration.

We are inclined, therefore, to believe that the only essential 
pathological condition of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis is that 
which its name indicates — an inflammation of the meninges, espe- 
cially of the pia mater, and that it does not differ in its character 
or tendencies from ordinary phlegmasias of serous membranes. Its 
locality gives it a fatal tendency not seen in pleuritis, but not much 
exceeding that of peritoneal inflammation. 

The only phenomenon that strongly supports the febrile theory 
in this disease, is the occurrence of petechia, and to them we now 
turn our attention. 

Among the numerous cases reported, we flnd petechise, or pur- 
puric spots, reported so infrequently that, taking into 
consideration the many instances in which the reports 
are obviously deficient in some respect, no numerical analysis of 
value can be made. The general statements of reporters seem to 
us, for once, more rehable than the statistics. Dr. Webber says, 
they are " not always present." Dr. Upham says ' " Petechia? 



DR. JONES o:jt petechia. 

.were not an unfrequent manifestation — in appearance almost iden- 
tical with the true typhus eruption, and like that seen upon every 
part of the body except the face ; persistent on pressure ; varying 
in hue from the darkest aspect of measles to that of the true pete- 
chial spots imbedded in the skin. Purpural spots, abundant and 
of large size, were sometimes present, and were always a gi'ave 
symptom." 

Dr. Russell, whose patients were mostly negroes, saw no pete- 
chise at all, and does not mention them or apoplectic spots in the 
lungs, or ecchymoses on the peritoneum as present. 

Dr. Simon, medical officer of the Privy Council of Great Brit- 
ain, in concluding his graphic description of this disease, says : 
" And now, frequently, the patient has eruptions upon his skin, — 
sometimes petechial, sometimes more or less exhibiting the charac- 
teristic exanthema of typhoid fever, measles, or other eruptive 
fever, but oftenest of all in the form of herpetic vesicles about the 
lips." 

Dr. Sanderson, who reports three hundred and forty-seven deaths 
in Northern Germany from this disease, many of which he wit- 
nessed, incidentally mentions, in the few autopsies he witnessed, 
that " in one of the rapid cases the discoloration was excessive, and 
there were, moreover, petechise of various sizes scattered on the 
trunk and inferior extremities." This is the only mention he 
makes of their occurrence. 

The cases furnished to us by Confederate surgeons rarely, if 
ever, mention petechias as among the signs before or after death. 
Dr. Jones discusses their value at length, and we make fi'om his 
records the following extract : — 

" Writers have been led into error by attributing the mottled appear- 
ance of the surface, and the changes of the secretions, as well as the 
marked disturbances of the circulatory and respiratory systems in 
cerebro-spinal meningitis, to the action of a poison disorganizing the 
blood. It is entirely pertinent to ask : If the blood is so disorganized 
in this disease, as to allow of the effiision of disorganized blood in the 
skin, why should all such effusions be absent from the structures most 
inflamed and diseased, the meninges of the brain and spinal cord? 
The fact is that these discolorations of the skin, in most cases of the 
disease, are not due to actual effusions of disorganized blood ; but merely 
to irregular capillary action and congestion, dependent upon deranged 
nervous action and circulation. It is unnecessary to do more in this 
connection than allude to the effects of pressure upon the medulla ob- 
longata, upon the functions of circulation and respiration. And even 
if it be true that the blood is disorganized in certain cases of cerebro- 



400 AUTOPSIES. 

spinal meningitis, such disorganization may be entirely explained by the 
derangements of circulation and respiration, induced by the disturbance 
and perversion of the functions of the cerebro-spinal system." 

The facts in the discussion seem to be, that the immediate effect 
of the disturbance of the nervous centres is to produce capillary 
congestion ; that the skin becomes flushed and livid ; that some- 
times hemorrhagic spots appear beneath its surface, and in the con- 
junctivae or lungs ; and that in one case the stomach, and in an- 
other, the peritoneum presented hemorrhagic effusions, or petechise, 
to a small extent. That these constitute a hemorrhao-ic effusion, de- 
pendent upon disorganized blood, vs^hich itself is dependent upon a 
specific poison is, thus far, not proven, nor does the evidence yet 
adduced assign to these occasional blood-spots any higher impor- 
tance than may be conceded to the much more common herjDetic 
eruptions about the lips. 

With the view of illustrating the post-mortem appearances that 
Further attend the rapidly fatal as well as the matured cases of 
autopsies. ^j^-g ^gg^ge, wc append, with comments, a few cases cov- 
ering the various periods of duration, from the initial chill until 
death : —

lung highly congested and softened. Spleen weighed thirteen ounces, 
of a light gray color, and a consistence like jelly. [We have omitted 
all negative facts, and thus much abbreviated the account, which is mi- 
nute. The splenic disease must have existed prior to the attack. The 
congestion of the lungs is characteristic of the embarrassment of the 
respiratory tract of the spinal cord.]

large quantities of hardened fasces. Sinapisms were applied over vari- 
ous parts of the body and limbs.

blood-vessels of the brain, and a deposit of lymph over upper surface 
of hemispheres of cerebrum and cerebellum. Some effusion in the 
ventricles ; thoracic and abdominal viscera healthy. 

These cases are typical. In all, even m those that died at a 
very early stage of the disease, some evidence of menin- 
geal inflammation was present. In some of them, it w^as 
only an opalescence of the arachnoid with small effusion, but in 
nearly all the post-mortem aj)pearances w^thin the eneephalon ac- 
count for death. The morbid conditions of other viscera, sometimes 
present, appear to have been previously existing, accidental, met- 
astatic, or due to the phenomena of death. We have endeavored 
to convey an intelligible idea of all the facts before us, and find it 
only necessary to call attention to the rapidity of effusion as closely- 
allied to the effusion of caco-plastic lymph in acute peritonitis, 
which is jfrequently fully established within a few hours after the 
exciting cause is applied, as, for instance, in perforation of the 
bowels. 

TREATMENT. 
In all peculiarly fatal diseases, the modes of treatment recom 
mended are numerous and contradictory. Not only do they vary 
with the theories that practitioners may entertain of the pathology 
of the disease, but with that feeling of irresolution or desperation 



402 REPOET OF DR. RUSSELL. 

which prompts strange remedies in a strange disease. Accordingly, 
we find an ahnost endless, certainly an absurd catalogue of reme- 
dies recommended by writers. Numerical analyses of results of 
treatment are notoriously faulty. Each such result must neces- 
sarily partake of all the errors of diagnosis, prognosis, and aetiology 
which may have existed in the mind of the practitioner. 

A Confederate surgeon at Grenada, Miss., saw thirty-five cases 
of cerebro-spinal meningitis, of which all died. He expresses the 
opinion that mercurials were the more successful remedies. He 
means that cases treated with mercurials lived longer than those 
under another treatment, and perhaps his use of the word " suc- 
cessful " is justifiable. We propose to quote somewhat freely from 
the reports in our hands, as to treatment, and leave the matter with 
the reader without extended comment. In a disease of which sev- 
enty in a hundred die, no therapeutics are a matter for boasting. 

Dr. RusselP reports the case of J. T., 1st Iowa Infantry, who 
Surgeon Ira was admitted in the second stage, comatose, pulseless, 
report. and musclcs contracted. Supposed to be moribund, noth- 

ing was done for him at first. On the second day sinapisms were 
ordered to the surface ; capsicum, quinine, and stimulants were 
given internally ; blisters were applied to the spine, and stimulating 
enemata were administered. The quinine was given in very large 
doses. This treatment, with a supporting diet, was continued, and 
the patient finally recovered. 

Dr. Russell says in conclusion (and it should be recollected that 
he speaks of the disease as a fever of the congestive variety) : — 

" The disease has been unquestionably of an asthenic type. At first 
surgeons were inclined to adopt an opposite theory, and to resort to 
active antiphlogistic remedies. But lack of success in treatment, and 
more mature reflection induced them to abandon such remedies, and to 
depend upon a stimulant and tonic treatment. I have been led to be- 
lieve that quinine, freely given in the early stages of the disease, prior 
to the period of collapse,^ exercises a controlling influence, and such is 
the opinion of the regimental surgeons who have treated cases before 
they were sent to the hospital. During the congestive chill and collapse, 
alcoholic stimulants, capsicum and quinine, mustard emetics and sinap- 
isms to the surface, and cups, wet and dry, to spine, seem to exert a 
good influence, and hasten the period of reaction. Opium has inva- 
riably been found to be a successful remedy, especially in controlling 
delirium and promoting reaction. 

" After reaction has been fiiirly established, blue mass and saline 
.cathartics have been followed by good results. Cups and blisters to

REMARKS OF DR. UPHAM. 403 

the spine, with a general tonic plan of treatment, with iodide of potas- 
sium, has manifestly been the best plan of treatment; while a nourish- 
ing diet has been found indispensable." 

Dr. Russell's statements of treatment are not tabulated. He 
says, that "more than one half died," — a ratio that compares 
fiivorabh' with the average success. 

Dr. Upham ^ says : — 

" In regard to treatment, when we consider the mortality, as shown in 
the preceding record (fifty-four deaths and seventeen recov- Dr. j. Baxter 
eries), but little that is satisfactory can be said. In the account, 
onset of the epidemic, it was naturally taken to be of malarious origin, 
and the usual means of combating such an affection were assiduously 
employed — quinine, in some instances, to the extent of sixty and even 
eighty grains, being oiven within ten or twelve hours from the first 
attack, but without effect ; conjoined with this, stimulants and purga- 
tives of calomel were freely used. Antiphlogistic measures were also 
tried — cupping, wet and dry, to the back of the head and nucha ; sa- 
line purgatives, epispastics, frictions along the spine, blisters to the in- 
side of thighs, calves, and ankles, with enemata of turpentine and 
brandy. When there was marked cerebral excitement, venesection was 
freely employed ; but its powerlessness to avert, or even mitigate the 
symptoms, is seen in Dr. Cowgill's account of a case at Academy Green 
Hospital, in which the remedy was faithfully tried. The patient was a 
strong, robust young man, — attacked suddenly and with great violence, 
— with urgent cerebral symptoms, great restlessness and jactitation, per- 
fect unconsciousness, and with a full pulse. He was bled to the amount 
of twenty-four ounces ; his pulse became stronger under the operation — 
no symptoms of faintness. He was quiet for twenty minutes, when the 
jactitation became as violent as before. At evening, there was violent 
muscular action, pulse eighty-six, strong and full ; the bandages were 
loosened, and sixteen ounces more of blood allowed to flow, the patient, 
in the mean time, being held upright in bed. There was no evidence of 
syncope, and no lessening of muscular action. The excitement contin- 
ued the whole night, and the patient died the next day. 

" Calomel in combination with ipecac, in doses of two grains of the 
former and half a grain of the latter, given every two hours, — in con- 
junction with frictions or sinapisms along the course of the spine, as 
reported by Dr. Cowgill, seemed, in several instances, to have a good 
effect. Dr. Haddock suggested the use of ergot, in accordance with the 
recommendations of Dr. Brown Sequard, in certain affections of the 
spinal cord, unaccompanied wath active inflammation. It was given in 
the form of the fluid extract in doses of from ten to fifteen minims, re- 
peated every four hours. Several of the cases thus treated by Dr. Had- 
dock recovered. Oftentimes a beneficial effect attended the exhibition

of camphor water, in combination with the carbonate of ammonia. 
Dover's powder and the sohition of sulphate of morphia were given, to 
induce sleep at night." 

Dr. Webber says : — 

" The natural tendency seems to be toward death. Treatment to be 
Dr. s. G. effectual must be early ; in nearly every case when delayed 
Tiews— Boyis- long, the rcsult was death. It is generally agreed that all de- 
E^ssay"^ bllitatiug measures should be avoided ; general bleeding is 
rather injurious than otherwise, though in the first and fifth cases re- 
corded by Dr. Robert Burns, of Philadelphia, in the ' American Journal 
of Medical Sciences,' for April, 1865, bleeding seemed to be beneficia]. 
.... Local bleeding, especially by means of leeches, to the back of 
the neck, or to the temples, and wherever inflammatory action has ap- 
peared, is beneficial." 

Dr. Webber recommends emetics at the onset, deprecates violent 
cathartics, approves support and stimulation, counter-irritation, fi'ic- 
tion, sinapisms, dry cuppings, and blisters, and says : — 

" Cold to the head by means of ice-bags or cloths wrung out in cold 
water ; stimulating enemata ; gentle cathartics ; quinine ; opium to quiet 
restlessness and procure sleep ; stimulants and nourishment in the 
shape of milk-punch, beef tea, strong broths, etc., have been generally 
adopted as the best means at our command to control this disease. 
Quinine and stimulants must be given freely and largely ; opium is con- 
sidered one of the most valuable remedies by many, and apparently with 
good reason, but it must be given in large doses frequently repeated." 

Dr. Webber also quotes the use of a strict antiphlogistic treat- 
ment by Dr. Burns, of Philadelphia; of opium, strychnia, and 
arsenic, by Dr. McVey, of Illinois ; of aconite, bisulphite of soda, 
and ergot, for each of which favorable results are claimed. 

Dr. Sanderson says : — 

"In almost every case, the practice during the acute stage consisted

of the disease in its severest forms, that no advantage could be hoped 
for from this remedy, unless it were adopted while the initial symp- 
toms still lasted, and that if the patient had already lapsed into the 
state of indifference, and especially if the breathing had the peculiar

character of slow inspiration, quick expiration, and prolonged pause, 
even though the face might still be flushed, and the skin feel warm, it 
was already too late to apply leeches. On the other hand, it appeared 
to be the general result of the experience of those who had seen the 
disease in its severest aspects, that even in cases in which the onset was 
most violent, free local bleeding during the first few hours, while the 
patient was still vomiting, might be expected to be attended with bene- 
fit, and occasionally produced the most striking results My own 

opportunities were, of course, far too limited to enable me to form an 
opinion on the question, but I think that the complete concurrence of 
opinion among practitioners is sufficient to warrant the statement that, 
notwithstanding the generally negative results that are observed, leech- 
ing and the application of ice cold to the spinal cord, is the only mode 
of treatment by which the progress of the disease is likely to be ar- 
rested, and that its utility is confined to the first day, and, in some in- 
stances, to the few hours after the patient has begun to vomit. 

" The employment of calomel in frequently repeated doses, varying 
from one to three grains, was as universal as that of local bleeding. It 
was given partly as a purgative, partly with a view to its so-called con- 
stitutional effects. Its purgative effect was increased by combining it 
with jalap, or by injections, or by administering, at the same time, infu- 
sion of senna with sulphate of magnesia, or either of these remedies 
separately. 

" In cases in which there were periodical exacerbations of pain, es- 
pecially if they were accompanied or preceded by febrile accessions, it 
was the habit to give quinine. Although some practitioners thought 
this remedy useful, and employed it in large doses, others were of opin- 
ion that the results were negative. 

" The advantage obtained by the administration of morphia afler the 
initial symptoms had subsided, as a means of calming the restlessness 
of the patient, of relieving the violent pain experienced in the neck and 
back, and thus inducing sleep, appeared to be unequivocal, nor did it 
seem to be attended with any unfavorable effects aflerwards. It was 
given either by the mouth (in doses of one eighth to one fourth of a 
grain), or by subcutaneous injection. Of the two methods the latter 
seemed preferable. 

" In the later stages of the disease, various vegetable tonics were em- 
ployed, with which it was usual to combine iodide of potassium, espe- 
cially in cases in which there was impairment of vision or hearing, 
persistent muscular pains or contraction, or other indications that the 
disease had left behind alteration of structure of important organs." 

It will be seen that the methods of treatment enumerated above 
are contradictory, principally because the pathology is comments 
clouded and obscure. The disposition on the part of some compUer.

observers to recognize, in cerebro-spinal meningitis, something as 
mysterious as it is fatal, has led to the suggestion of quaint and 
unusual therapeutics. Reducing this disease to its simplest formula, 
the mystery is resolved. Whatever its causation, whatever its rela- 
tion to zymotic poison, we find at last that it is the mechanical press- 
ure of effused lymph and serum, products of inflammation, within 
a bony case, that kills the patient. All treatment, therefore, should 
be directed to the prevention of eff'usion, and its removal when 
present. 

In the present stage of our knowledge, we are compelled to as- 
sume that this disease is a simple inflammation of a serous mem- 
brane, which is fatal because of its locality rather than from any 
intrinsic power of harm that it possesses. If the epidemic agency, 
whatever it may be, were directed to the pericardium, the pleura, or 
the peritoneum, we should have mutatis mutandis^ the same patho- 
ological conditions, and a measure of fatality proportioned to the 
importance of the part attacked. 

We are therefore called upon to treat this disease at two separate 
stages. If we meet it in the dry stage, when the inflammation is 
still gathering force, an antiphlogistic treatment — always with a 
view to the effusion that must follow — is demanded. The dry 
stage is brief; and the patient can rarely be placed under treatment 
before the second stage — that of effusion — is upon us. From 
that time the treatment changes, and all the means with which we 
are familiar, to check eff'usion and promote absorption, are to be 
employed. 

iETIOLOGY. 

Climate evidently exercises a controlling influence on the causa- 
tion of cerebro-spinal meningitis. The American epi- 
demics we have studied all occurred in the winter or 
early spring, and Dr. John Simon informs us that of one hundred 
and eighty-two epidemics occurring in Europe, ten were in August 
and September, twenty-four in October and November, forty-six in 
December and January, forty-eight in February and March, thirty 
in April and May, and, again, twenty-four in June and July. We 
believe, also, that a more rigid analysis would show that the epi- 
demics in winter months have been far more extended and fatal 
than those which have oc^curred during the heats of summer. 
Exposure to the inclemencies of weather — to the same causes 
that produce acute rheumatism, pleuritis, and peri- 
xposure. (>r^j.^ji^ig — must also bc reckoned among the more fre- 
quent causes of the disease. The French army of the Alps, in 



DR. SIMOX'S REMARKS OK EPIDEMICS. 407 

■ 1814, after camping in the snow and suffering severely, developed 
an epidemic of cerebro-spinal meningitis. So, too, in the Confed- 
erate army at Fredericksbm'g, Va., in the winter of 1862-63, it 
appeared as an epidemic under circumstances of exposure. At 
Mobile, Ala., and Grenada, Miss., it also appeared among troops in 
the field, and the greater portion of the mortahty at Benton Bar- 
racks may be fairly ascribed to the great hardships endured by the 
negroes in their escape from their masters, and the insufficient care 
bestowed upon them by the United States authorities before their 
muster-in as soldiers. In this latter instance, the weather was 
bitterly cold, and the exposure of the men in transportation was 
excessive. 

A reference to our remarks upon the history of this disease will 
show that it has its favorite habitat in prisons and bar- pnsons and 
racks. The four or five years following 1837, it invaded ''^''■'"'^'■ 
nearly all the crowded barracks of France. It has appeared fre- 
quently among the galley-slaves at Toulon, and has taken the 
name of "jail fever" in England. The epidemic occurring at 
Newbern, N. C, was certainly connected with the bad material 
and construction of the barracks occupied by the three or four 
regiments that suffered — their habitations being damp, cold, and 
poorly ventilated. The prison at Little Rock, Ark., is another 
and striking example of this source of causation. The winter was 
severe, the weather alternating between snow and rain. The 
prison was shut in by high walls of masonry, and the premises, 
though well policed, were excessively damp and chilly. The 
deaths occurred as well among the guard as the prisoners, but only 
in one section of the prison. 

Upon this point Etr. John Simon remarks that — 
" Epidemics have seemed particularly apt to occur in establishments 
where masses of special population have been living in common domi- 
cile — as in work-houses, convict prisons, schools, and (above all) bar- 
racks. And in several such cases the epidemic has seemed to confine 
itself to one section of the estabh'shment — to one block of building, 
to one floor, or to one room. It is asserted here that, as a general rule, 
the affected segment of population has been in overcrowded and ill- 
ventilated quarters. And when the disease has spread from such cen- 
tres, or has independently arisen among common populations, this, 
almost always, has been said to have been under similar unwholesome- 
ness of circumstances. Where the epidemic has been among soldiers, 
officers have enjoyed almost entire immunity ; and where common pop- 
ulations have been suffering, the disease has shown great, if not exclu- 
sive, preference for the worst-lodged classes of the community. Re- 
viewing the evidence which exists on these points, I am strongly of the 



408 SEX AND AGE. — SUMMARY. 

opinion that the best sanitary precaution which in the present state of 
knowledge can be taken against this disease, must consist in care for 
the ventilation of dwellings. But in stating this, I must add that in 
some cases, according to local reports, the distribution of an epidemic 
has very decidedly not been governed by conditions of overcrowding 
and ventilation." 

Nearly all observers concur, and none adduce any reasoning to 
Epidemic ^^^ Contrary, that the epidemic constitution of cerebro- 
constitution. gpij^^l meningitis is felt by very many in the vicinity, who 
do not finally develop the full phenomena of the disease. Head- 
aches, neuralgias, slight stiffness of the muscles, and soreness of the 
cutaneous surface, are common among those who are classed as 
well, but are subjected to the same atmospheiic influence. This 
fact is sufficiently evident to prove the existence of a controlling 
atmospheric cause; while the simultaneous development in the 
same community of other acute inflammatory diseases much sim- 
plifies our quest as to the causation, by removing it from the mys- 
tery of a special cause, and justifying us in assigning to this 
disease a place among the phlegmasise. 

The army records of cerebro-spinal meningitis, of course, are 
negative as to the preference of this disease for either 

Sex and age. r^ i i •it n ^ • i 

sex. (Jtlier sources supply us ^vltn the proof that it has 
no sexual preferences — the statistics of Dr. Sanderson showing one 
hundred and sixty-four cases among males, and one hundred and fifty- 
four among females. As to age, we need only refer to his tables 
to show how preeminently this is a disease of youth ; and to the 
army records for the other fact, that it attacks the robust and 
healthy. 

We arrive, therefore, at the conclusion that cerebro-sj^inal men- 
ingitis has no special causation different from those gen- 
eral atmospheric conditions of cold, exposure, bad venti- 
lation, etc., that provoke the common phlegmasiae of fibrous and 
serous membranes, which, in all their laws as to season and modes 
of attack, and especially in the pathological conditions they de- 
velop to the anatomist of disease, seem to seek the same localities 
and attack the same classes of persons. The difference in the 
fatality of the several diseases alluded to, may be fairly stated as 
a difference in the relative importance to the functions of life of 
the locality attacked. A given morbific influence may attack the 
pleura, with only the result of recovery after a brief illness. The 
same influence assaulting tlie nutritive membranes of the nervous 
centres, must produce death if it goes on long enough to establish 
the usual exudations of organizable lymph. 



IS CEREBRO-SPIKAL MENINGITIS CONTAGIOUS? 409 



IS CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS CONTAGIOUS ? 

We have omitted contagion from the setiological argument. We 
well aware that it has been often spoken of as a contagious 
disease, but are at a loss to discover the evidence upon which that 
theory rests. The pecuhar character of the symptoms, especially 
those of the second stage, bear a strong resemblance, in many 
cases, to the phenomena that occur in diseases which are certainly 
capable of being propagated by contagion. But these phenomena 
themselves occur in a different manner. To use a popular phrase, 
the disease, after completing its deterioration of the blood, '' goes 
to the brain." In cerebro-spinal meningitis, it begins at the brain 
and remains there — the affections of other organs, as we have 
shown, being intercurrent, metastatic, or existing prior to the at- 
tack. There is no disorganization of the blood, except that which 
can be rationally ascribed to the failing power of the lungs to 
aerate the blood, dependent upon the mechanical pressure on the 
respiratory tract. 

It may be urged that petechias may be classed as evidence 
of blood-poison. But they, or something like them, are only re- 
corded in one third of the cases in which any mention of them 
could be expected, while so good an observer as Dr. Sanderson 
excludes or omits them altogether from his carefully drawn cata- 
logue of signs and symptoms. Dr. Jones, of the Confederate ser- 
vice, asserts that the ecchymotic spots sometimes seen are not 
petechial ; that they are merely a part of that general capillary 
congestion which depends upon the disturbance of the nervous 
centres ; and it seems to us altogether probable that the ecchy- 
moses which occur in the conjunctiva, the occasional, but rare, 
apoplectic spots in the lung, and the half-described similar spots, 
only once or twice mentioned, in the peritoneum, are mere " blood- 
shot " effusions dependent upon capillary stasis. 

The exudation uniformly found in the meninges of the brain and 
cord, is not of the character that attends putrid or contagious dis- 
eases. Microscopically examined, it is found to be an organizable 
lymph, of a far higher grade of cell-formation than we find in tlie 
blood poisons. The cases of recovery evidence this ; and we find 
patients recovering slowly or rapidly, in proportion to the probable 
amount of exudation, or suffering from sequelas, such as blindness 
and deafness, which are occasioned by the deposits of inflamma- 
tion destroying the delicate apparatus of the eye or ear. 

But the most positive evidence of the non-contagiousness of cere- 



410 IS CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS CONTAGIOUS? 

bro-spinal meningitis is in tlie bald fact tliat no well-proven case of 
contagious origin has met our eye, either in books or in our per- 
sonal observation. In looking over the various reports before us, 
we find a valuable internal evidence in the constant statement that 
the patient was admitted to hospital with the disease ; and in no 
single instance do we find that a case has originated within a hos- 
pital. It is well known that patients with this disease were not 
isolated in the army hospitals during the recent war. Whatever 
contagious elements they had were freely distributed among other 
patients and the attendants ; yet we find no instance m which the 
disease seems to have been propagated from man to man. 

Dr. Sanderson remarks, with reference to the epidemic in 
Northern Germany : — 

" No facts were met with in the course of the inquiry which afforded 
ground for beHeving that epidemic meningitis was capable of being 
communicated by personal intercourse. The following considerations 
tend toward a contrary inference : — 

1. "No single instance occurred to me in which there was the 
slightest reason to believe that any communication had taken place be- 
tween the family in which the first case occurred in any district and 
one previously infected. 

2. " The disease broke out in the two districts of the department of 
Dantzig, which were eventually most severely visited, so far as can be 
ascertained, at the same time, viz., about the 15th of January, although 
these places are at a distance of at least thirty miles from each other." 

3. [Dr. Sanderson remarks that in Dantzig no two cases occurred in 
any one house, and that there was no transmission of the disease in the 
hospitals.] 

4. " In those families in which more than two children were attacked 
about the same time, the intervals between the attacks were so short, 
that it could scarcely be supposed there had been communication from 
one child to another." 

In the absence of any positive proof of contagion, it is hardly 
worth the while to prolong the negative argument. Yet the grand 
law which governs the coming and going of this terrible malady 
may be mentioned as a part of the history. It is most fortunate 
that cerebro-spinal meningitis, a disease so fatal, and which yields 
so little to the skill of the physician, occurs always in " small, com- 
pact epidemics." We find it developing only fifty cases out of the 
many thousands congregated at Benton Barracks ; only forty at 
Newbem, N. C. ; only a dozen at Little Rock, in a body of per- 
haps ten thousand troops in winter cantonments ; thirty cases oc- 
curred at Grenada, Miss. ; and in the vast army of Northern 



CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.

Irginia we find record of only fourteen cases occurring in two 

istinct epidemics. 
Contagious diseases do not tlius limit and terminate themselves. 

?hey propagate by fomites ; and so long as the latter exist, the 
5ease will be developed. But cerebro-spinal meningitis never 
"accompanies the march of a column ; never follows the great high- 
w^ays of travel. It comes unheralded to a single locality, taking 
one and leaving another by laws of its own, and departs with the 
first change of weather, or the first removal of its prospective vic- 
tims from the scene of its ravages.

The knowledge upon which the views of the present essay are 
founded, was obtained in the U. S. Army Hospital for Injuries and 
Diseases of the Nervous System, and from numerous cases since 
Previous ^^^^ observed by me in private practice. In 1864 I 
publication*, puj^ligl^ed a Small volume on this subject in conjunction 
with my colleagues, Drs. Morehouse and Keen. In a second 
paper — Circular No. 6, 1864, U. S. Army Medical Bureau — we 
related instances of paralysis of one or more limbs, produced by 



SYMPTOMS OF INJURIES OF NERVE TRUNKS. 413 

rjurles of remote regions of the body ; and, more recently,^ I 
again reported these cases, with additions and corrections, and 
with a lull critical review of all the former relations of similar 
histories. Besides the practical information which these papers 
ccntained, we recorded at length our experience in the use of 
hypodermic injections in neuralgic cases, in the '' American Jour- 
nal of Medical Sciences," July, 1865 ; and in the number for 
October, 1864, of the same journal, we discussed the subject of 
malingering — chiefly with reference to simulation of nervous mal- 
adies. 

Having, therefore, already considered the most important points 
in gunshot and other injuries of nerves, I shall dwell in these pages 
upon such matters as have 'not been so amply discussed ; and shall 
draw my illustrations chiefly from records of cases which have not 
as yet been published. 

It is needless to add that I can only give here a condensed state- 
ment of my present opinions, and that for minute details the reader 
must refer to the papers above enumerated. 

PRIMARY SYMPTOMS OF WOUNDS OR OTHER INJURIES OF NERVE 

TRUNKS. 

When a person receives a sudden injury of a nerve of impor- 
tance, he usually feels as though he had been struck with sensation 
a stick or a stone. In a very few instances, no pain is Sefa3 
experienced ; and, in still fewer, the pain is referred to *^®° ^"J"''^" 
some remote part of the body. In one case, a wound of the right 
brachial plexus was felt as a violent pain in both elbows. Several 
similar wounds caused sudden pain at the insertion of the deltoid 
muscle. I have been told by some of my patients, that the burning 
neuralgia first described by my colleagues and myself began in- 
stantly upon the occurrence of the wound. Of this, however, I 
have some doubt. 

Loss or diminution of motor power and of sensation, of course 
follow instantly upon a wound of a nerve. I shall discuss loss or im- 
them more fully in future. It is sufficient here to say, Si^ran*d 
that, as a rule, motion is more often and more perma- ««'^«^*^o'^- 
nently impaired than sensation ; and that, except in absolute divis- 
ion of a nerve, motion is apt to improve considerably within the 
first week. Thus, if we suppose a case where a ball passes over a 
nerve, and very near to it, we may have immediate loss of motion, 
partial of sensation ; entire and rapid restoration of the latter ;

414 PHENOMENA FOLLOWING NERVE WOUNDS. 

slower return of motility ; and, finally, prolonged or even perma- 
nent want of power in some single group of muscles. I remem- 
ber one very striking instance in the spring of 1864. 

" A sergeant, wounded in the left lower neck, was placed in our wards 
Case within four days from the date of his wound, which seemed 

to have directly implicated the brachial plexus of that side. 
His arm was totally palsied as to motion and sensation at the moment 
he was hit. Sensation returned within five days. Motor power was 
restored in all the flexor muscles of the hand within ten days ; and, 
under three applications of electricity, it reappeared also in all the other 
muscles except the deltoid and triceps extensor, which never perfectly 
regained their functions." 

The remarkable manner in which the sensory nerves reco"ver 
Explanation their fuuction has been elsewhere explained by us as 
rlcoTCrrof^ being due to the constant automatic exercise of the sense 
sensation. ^£ ^^^^.^ whercas the function of motion demands a dis- 
tinct volition. If this accounts for the early return of sensibility 
in wounded limbs— and I am not fully satisfied that it does— it will 
not explain why it sometimes happens that, a nerve being wounded, 
only motion is lost, or only sensation. I suspect that, in most 
nerves, the fibres of motion and sensation are, more or less, kept 
together in bundles, so to speak ; and that, in some of the cases 
above described, the facts may be explained by this aiTangement. 

The question here raised is one of great anatomical, and of some 
practical interest, but I can find no authority which attempts to 
answer it. The popular medical opinion supposes that, after the 
sensitive and motor roots of a spinal nerve unite, their respective 
filaments become uniformly distributed throughout the area of the 
nerve trunk ; to be again re-collected into bundles having separate 
functions, near to the points where the skin, or muscle-supplies 
respectively, are given off from the parent stem. Such an arrange- 
ment would involve, to my mind, a lack of economy in Nature, 
without, as it would seem, any sufiicient reason ; while the results 
of nerve wounds, on the other hand, plainly indicate the proba- 
bility that the two sets of nerve fibres remain, for the most part, 
grouped in distinct fasciculse throughout the track of the main nerve. 
It would not be difficult to settle the question by experiment. 

The general phenomena which follow nerve wounds, are imme-

leno-th in the papers above referred to. We considered it then, 
as I still do now, a condition of temporary paralysis from periph- 
eral lesion. In fact, there may be every variety as to persist- 
ence, severity, and extent of loss of function ; so that from one 
wonnd may be witnessed a brief general loss of power, with that 
of the heart ; from another, defect of power in one limb, or more, 
for a few hours or days ; and in a third, a like result of permanent 
character. These latter cases are very rare, and have been de- 
scribed as reflex paralyses. Thus, the same mechanism which oc- 
casions these graver maladies, is competent, as I think, to aboHsh 
for a time the irritabihty of the nerve centres in general ; in some 
cases touching the heart most ; in others, acting with greatest 
severity on the organs of intelligence ; and, in rare instances, so 
disturbing the central ganglia as to occasion death. 

The secondary phenomena of a general nature, or, at least, not 
of necessity involving the part wounded, are paralyses such as I 
have just now described, and tetanus. 

I have never met with a case of tetanus in a patient affected with 
a wound of a nerve trunk. This would be the more re- 

Tetanus. 

markable, as I have personally treated several hundred 
cases of nerve wounds, were it not that most of them reached our 
wards after the first few weeks of treatment had gone by, when, in 
no small proportion, the wounds had long been healed, and the 
period of danger was over. 

Choreal affections must be very uncommon consequences of 
nerve wounds. Simple tremor of muscles, or of groups 

r> 1 Ti Tremor. 

of muscles, was more frequent, and was readily re- 
lieved. Two of the most interesting choreal maladies I have seen, 
were the results of amputation of the thumb and fore-arm respect- 
ively, and were induced during the cicatrization of the stumps. 
The following history is a good illustration of this malady : — 

Case I. Gunshot Wound of Right Wrist : Immediate Amputation ; 
Choreal Affection of Muscles of Right Fore-arm {stump) and Shoidder. — 
Col. J. G. P., age 41, 139th Pennsylvania Volunteers, an officer of high 
character, in good health up to the date of wound, was shot, June 3d, 
1864, through the right wrist with a slug, lie became at once singularly 
excited, and felt as if he was crazed. Under the sudden influence of 
these sensations, he ran along the line of his regiment, only half con- 
scious, until he fell senseless, having gone about fifty feet. Within a 
few minutes he revived, and was assisted to a hospital near by, where 
Dr. Chapin, surgeon of the regiment, amputated his fore-arm at the 
junction of the lower and middle third. 



416 CASE OF CHOREAL AFEECTION. 

Col. P. never remained in bed, but continued in active service while 
the wound healed. This process was over about September 20th, 1864. 
At this date, some one remarked to him that his stump shook a good 
deal. This first attracted his attention. Within a month the quivering 
extended to all the muscles of the fore-arm, except the extensor group, 
and at the close of the second month it attacked the biceps, triceps, and 
deltoid. In November a seton was carried through the skin of the 
stump. For a day or two the limb was much more quiet, but again be- 
came worse. Tincture of aconite was used locally without relief. A 
firm bandage applied to the whole limb, produced no good result, the 
movements getting constantly worse. At length a large part of the 
cicatrix of the stump was dissected out. For a few days he did better, 
and then relapsed as after the use of other remedies. 

March 1, 1865. — The fore-arm is incessantly in motion, the mus- 
cles quivering in a singular manner, night and day, whether asleep or 
awake. Every twenty seconds, or oftener, the fore-arm is suddenly 
flexed, and more rarely the arm is thrown across the chest by the pec- 
toral group, or upwards and outwards by the deltoid. These movements 
are beginning to involve the trunk and neck muscles of the right side. 
They are increased if attention be drawn to them, but they allow him to 
make voluntary movements with the aid of the muscles in question, and 
do not seem to interfere with or disturb this volitional control, as hap- 
pens in the chorea of children. The moment his will ceases to act, 
the spasms recur, but he does not feel any fatigue from this endless mus- 
cular action. All the muscles move readily under induced electric cur- 
rents. The stump is not unusually tender, and there is no soreness in 
the nerve tracks when tested by heat or pressure. 

Col. P.'s general health is suffering somewhat, but at no time except 
during the few days of leave, which he sought in order to consult me, 
has he failed to do full duty in the field. On one occasion only is he 
aware that the arm ceased to move. This occurred at the battle of Cedar 
Mountain, when, his regiment having been cut off, he was in grave dan- 
ger of capture. He fought his way out and saved his command. Dur- 
ing the two or three hours of suspense, and while constantly under fire, 
his men observed that his arm ceased to move, and hung limber at his 
side. 

I felt strongly disposed to consider these motions as caused by some 
nerve lesion originally confined to the stump, and occasioning an excita- 
tion of the centres which gave rise reflectively to the spasms. To test this, 
I proposed to inject a paralyzing agent into the neighborhood of the main 
nerve trunks, and failing thus to check the conveyance of irritations to 
the centres, I should have wished to divide the chief nerves in the arm, 
removing half an inch. This, of course, would have paralyzed the mus- 
cles below. If, then, it were still found that the deltoid and pectoralis 
twitched, I should have concluded that the nerves were diseased above

le point of section. Of this, some judgment could have been formed 
by examining with the microscope the section of nerve removed by 
the knife. After this there would have been no surgical remedy, ex- 
cepting section of the brachial plexus in the neck, an operation which, 
I presume, might offer some embarrassments. 

As Colonel P. was obliged to return to duty at once, I contented my- 
self with ordering him to have two setons through the stump, and to 
take ten grains of bromide of potassium thrice daily. April 17th, I 
heard from him. He had been again severely wounded in the side, 
March 25th, and lay insensible for some time, although the limb all the 
while twitched as usual. He recovered readily, and at the date of April 
17, wrote "that the limb had ceased to jump as it did, but is never still. 
It quivers all the time." 

I saw Colonel P. September 29, 1865. The arm, at this time, rarely 
executed any violent or wide movements ; but the fore-arm was much 
as his letter described it to have been in April. A greater gain was vis- 
ible in the chest, neck, and trunk, the muscles of which no longer 
twitched. His general health was better, and he had become robust 
and well. I desired him to renew the treatment as soon as he was at 
rest in any one place, and hoped to persuade him, at a future period, to 
allow of some such operation as I have alluded to above. 

Neuralgia of parts distant from that injured by the wound was 

rare. The very remarkable case of Lieutenant G ,^ 

affords proof that such a result may follow a gunshot ^"'^*^*' 
wound. The purpose of this present paper limits me to the dis- 
cussion of gunshot and other injuries of nerves, and does not allow 
of the introduction of wounds of the centres. I shall therefore 
omit this subject, which was, in part, studied in our book on gun- 
shot wounds of nerves, and pass on to consider the matters more 
immediately within our present scope. 

In the book above referred to (p. 54) the modes in which nerves 
may be injured, were thus classified : — ciassifica- 

1. Direct injury by contusion, or by a missile, result- modes in 
ing in partial or complete division, — Pressure. Tre'Lj^r^^ 

2. Commotion, owing to the passage of a missile close to a

3. Injury from dislocations of bones, and attempts at their re- 
duction. 

4. Cicatricial changes affecting nerves. 

6. Extension of diseased processes from injured nerves to nerves 
previously healthy.

to determine this question by anatomical knowledge. 

Injuries to nerves from contusion presented themselves occa- 
sionally in our special hospital, but most of mv own 

Contusion. / . , .^ , pi i -, . -, n 

experience m this class oi cases, has been derived from 
private practice. 

As a rule, contusions of nerves, unless very severe, do not 
cause entire loss of function early in the case, but they are apt to 
originate morbid processes which finally occasion results almost as 
severe and permanent as those which arise from division of the 
nerve by a missile. 

The following history is a fair example of injury by con- 
tusion : — 

" Mrs. K., aged fifty-two, fell and struck her right neck against one of 
Case of in- the round knobs of a brass fender. There was swelling and 

jury by 

contusion. also a good deal of pain felt in the right arm for a few min- 
utes, owing, as I supposed, to violence done to the brachial plexus. In 
a few weeks, the blood extravasated at the spot struck was absorbed. 
Slight pain was felt in the fore-arm and hand at intervals, until the 
twelfth week, when it became extreme around the shoulder joint. 
Next came loss of motion and wasting in the deltoid, with increase of 
tenderness at the site of the blow. Leeches were freely used every 
third day at this point until the soreness was lessened, when I blistered 
the part twice. The shoulder pains were now diminishing, and at the 
fourteenth week I began to use hypodermic injections of one eighth 
grain sulph. morphia with one fiftieth grain sulph. atropia. Under this 
treatment, employed daily, she lost all pain except when the arm was 
moved. I made two efforts to faradize the deltoid, but each time caused 
increase of pain. At the fifth month I was able to resort to the bat- 
tery, under which the muscle gained bulk and power very rapidly. 
After twenty sittings she could raise the arm outwards to an angle 
of 45^ 

"A year afterwards, Mrs. K. had an attack of inflammatory rheu- 
matism, which left her with distressing neuralgia of the ulnar distribu- 
tion chiefly, and with some weakness of the fore-arm. 

" This attack was treated by leeching, blistering tender points in the 
nerve, and absolute rest of the member — a measure which I have 
sometimes found of the utmost value. The arm finally remained 
feeble, and the pain is now, a year later, so rare and so slight as to give 
but little annoyance." 



LOCAL PALSY FROM PRESSURE. 410 

jury to a nerve from pressure is rarely observed in military 
hospitals, if we except the very numerous and interesting ^^^^^^ 
ises of what was known in our own hospital as " crutch 
tlsy." 

This malady comes on in the following manner : A man 
wounded in the leg, and more or less emaciated, gets on crutch 
crutches. In a few days he feels a numbness or tingling p^''^- 
in the little finger of one hand — and it is commonly the right — 
with sometimes a loss of feeling. Next his grasp becomes feeble, 
and he can no longer hold the crutch. Thus the evil brings its 
own remedy ; but, for a time, the loss of power may even increase 
after the cratch has been abandoned ; and this fact has in certain 
cases misled physicians as to the true causation. 

In some of these patients there is axillary soreness ; in others 
there is none. The prognosis is always favorable. We found that 
rest and the use of electricity brought about rapid cures, which 
were permanent if the patient employed in future a cane or a 
crutch provided with an elastic cushion. This was most needed 
in men of large frame, but so reduced in flesh as to have lost the 
perfect natural padding which in health would have protected the 
nerves from pressure. 

I have myself met with this form of disease in civil practice. 
I have also seen nerve injury caused by the pressure on the arm 
made by the handle of a heavy basket. 

My friend. Dr. John H. Brinton, late surgeon U. S. Volun- 
teers, has seen cases of local weakness in the ulnar dis- Pressure of 
tribution produced by the pressure of the snaffle rein on rein, 
the radial side of the third finger during long cavalry marches. 
In rare instances this amounts to partial palsy of the finger first 
afiected, and is apt to be felt after a time in other terminal 
branches supplied by the ulnar nerve. 

Dr. Brinton has also encountered two cases of local palsy which 
proved very tedious, and were brought about by the use p^igy from 
of a form of restraint employed by the police in Phila- Snfu7e'd 
delphia, and perhaps elsewhere. It consists of a cord adeiphia*^"^' 
attached at the ends to two small handles. This rope is ^°^^^' 
passed around the arm of a prisoner, and is sometimes twisted. 
The two handles are held in the grasp of the officer, who may 
make the pressure as light or as severe as suits his own views. 
It is easily conceivable that injudicious use of such a formidable 
means of restraint may occasion the mischief which Dr. Brinton 
has seen it produce. 



420 CASE OF CRUTCH PALSY. 

A very strange collection of cases of palsy from pressure is to 
be met with in the " Recueil de M^moires de Medecine de Chi- 
rurgie et de Pharmacie Militaires," etc., T. 11th (3d s^rie) quatri- 
eme fascicule ; No. 52 ; Avril, 1864. In this paper M. Bachon 
describes a number of cases of palsy of the radial nerve, caused in 
the following way : — 

" In the town of Rennes the supplies of water are brought to the 
Palsy from houses in huge jars. The bellies of these enormous vessels 
carrying are Supported on the antero-lateral part of the thorax. Each 
^tev!^^^^ jar has a large handle, through which the carrier thrusts 
his arm, so as then to embrace the circumference of the vessel, which 
he presses against his chest. At the same time the humerus is thrown 
upwards and outwards to give to the handle a solid point of support. 
It is a grotesque and painful sight to see a man, or even sometimes a 
woman, embracing, full-armed, two of these enormous spheroids, of a 
total weight of about seventy-six pounds, the body thrown backwards to 
keep an equilibrium, the arms spread apart, the elbows up, the bearer 
slowly toiling up the narrow staircase of a house in Rennes. 

" In this position the pressure of the handle falls obliquely across the 
radial nerve, which is thus compressed, bruised, and irritated. As a 
consequence, we have paralysis of the extensor muscles of the hand 
and fingers." 

The same author relates a case of palsy of the radial nerve from 
the use of a crutch, in which sensibility was not impaired. In the 
cases observed by my colleagues and myself, there was always 
some aifection of sensitive nerves before motility was at all dis- 
ordered. I append a single case which illustrates the whole class. 
In it, as in all I have seen, the ulnar nerve was first aflPected. 

" Q. C. Meaning, aged forty, porter. Company B, 1st Massachusetts 
Case of Cavalry, enlisted September, 1861. Previously well. In Jan- 

crutch palsy, ^^^ry, 1863, he fell and broke both bones of right leg. Union 
took place with deformity and unusual difiiculty in locomotion. From 
April 25th to June 20th, he walked on two common wooden crutches, 
and then, until July 11th, on one which he used on the right side, lean- 
ing heavily upon it. On the last named day he walked a great deal more 
than usual, and immediately after found that the third and fourth fin- 
gers were benumbed. The following night he lost partially the use of his 
arm. The axilla felt sore, but there was no evidence of any central 
lesion, and no syphilitic or rheumatic antecedents. Since then his biceps 
has regained power, but no other muscle has improved. 

" July 21sf, 1863. — Present state : Shoulder muscles act well, except 
the deltoid, which is feeble. The other muscles of the arm act well. 
Biceps feeble ; pronation and supination good ; flexion and extension 



CICATRICIAL CHANGES, ETC. 421 

wrist nearly absent ; finger motions all excessively weak. Sensation 
absent in ulnar side of palm, wrist, and fore-arm ; nearly absent in fore- 
finger. The fore-arm muscles have their electric contractility les- 
sened ; and the abductor min. digit, has very little. The axillary nerves 
are not tender on pressure. 

" Ireatment. — To use a cane in left hand ; to have a starch bandage 
as a support for the broken leg ; douche and faradization daily to fore- 
arm. The relief was rapid and complete — so much so that' within 
two months he recovered the full use of all' the weakened muscles. 
Sensation returned more slowly, but finally was aided by dry gal- 
vanism. He was put on guard duty after four months' treatment, 
but had then, I believe, some slight numbness in the fourth finger and 
ulnar palm." 

Class II. — When a ball passes through a part, it not only 
destroys what lies in its track, but it disturbs the sur- injury by 
rounding tissues for a distance whose radius is as yet co^^^ot'o^- 
undetermined. The effects which result are known to the French 
authors as " local shock." They consist, I presume, in a molecular 
dislocation of the atoms of parts, such as, in the case of a nerve, 
would, at least for a time, be fatal to its function. I suppose that 
this local impression is in reality a physical shock — a shaking of 
the parts. It is best illustrated in those spinal injuries in which a 
ball has passed over the spine without breaking the bones, and yet 
has given rise to palsy of the parts below its track.^ 

I am disposed to think that, despite the apparent gravity of these 
spinal injuries, they do better, on the whole, than cases where the 
local shock has fallen upon a simple nerve trunk in a limb. Why 
this should be, I cannot say. I am sure that I have seen very 
permanent palsy in a case where the ball could not have passed 
nearer to the nerve than a full inch. As yet, however, despite 
the opportunities of frequent wars, we do not know how far the 
destructive influence of a ball may be radiated around its actual 
track, nor, indeed, how great, relatively, is this effect in balls at 
high and low rates of speed. 

Class III. — In the volume so often quoted, we related several 
instances of loss of nerve function following upon dislo- injuries 
cation of the head of the humerus. Case XIII., op. cit., tion.or °*^" 
afforded a remarkable history of a local palsy so pro- at reduction. 
duced. 

Class IV. — Neuralgia, distinctly due to cicatrix changes 
affecting nerves, is a very rare incident, if we except the cicatrices 
which follow amputations. A few instances of the former class

422 PROPAGATED DISEASE OF NERA^S. 

have fallen under my care, but in most of tliem relief was easily 
cS"eSn- obtained by frictions, and by changing the position of 
iliju^""""^^ the limb. 

The cicatrices of stumps may give occasion to terrible 
and permanent maladies, such as neuralgia and chorea.^ A singu- 
lar case of the first is related by Dr. Nott.^ It is a good illustration 
of the alterations which a nerve may undergo, and aptly illustrates 
the necessity for early and bold treatment. Cicatrices are rarely so 
placed as to cause loss of motion. In one instance this seemed to 
us to be the case.^ There was want of power in certain positions ; 
but it is possible that the great pain which arose may have been 
the true agent in producing the sudden feebleness then observed. 

Class V. — In close relation to the changes in nerves which fol- 
Propagated low auiputatious are those interesting cases in which, as 
nerves. it sccmcd to US, an injury of a nerve causes inflammatory 

changes which are propagated inwards, and thus finally affect one 
or more of the cords constituting the parent plexus. We gave * 
examples of this result, and were inclined to reject the belief that 
the implication of other nerves than that first wounded was due to 
reflex irritation. 

An able critic of our paper is of opinion that we had insufficient 
grounds for this conclusion. Our decision was influenced by the fol- 
lowing considerations : — 

The nerves secondarily affected were those which arose most 
immediately from that part of the parent plexus in connection 
^^'ith the wounded nerve. The affection of the nerves was com- 
monly indicated by soreness upon pressure ; and this soreness was 
very marked in the nerves finally attacked. Of these changes I 
give a very excellent illustration in the following case : — 

C. P., clerk, aged 22, while fencing, was struck by the button of his 
opponent's foil upon the middle and outside of the right arm. 
The shirt-sleeve was torn, and the flesh bruised severely. 
He felt a sharp pain, which subsided into a tingling in the thumb 
and outside of fore-arm. This continued for several days, and on the 
tenth day became distressing. Upon examining his arm I found that 
the motions of the index finger were feeble, and that the wrist was ex- 
tended with difficulty. The track of the radial nerve was sore, and the 
point on which the blow fell exceedingly tender. Notwithstanding the 
deep situation of the musculo-spiral nerve, it was also tender upon 

1 It is very deeply to be regretted that the vast mass of amputations, which were col- 
lected at one time in Philadelphia, was not made use of for a scientific study of the diseases 
of stumps. This was one of the many lost opportunities of the late rebellion.

CASE OF PROPAGATED DISEASE. 423 

pressure, and continued to be so for many weeks. I had the nerve 
tracks leeched twice a week, and used, on the same days, an injection of 

orphia and atropia over the radial nerve. These means partially re- 

ved the hand ; but the pain along the outer aspect of the arm became 
orse, and assumed an intermittent type, appearing every day after 

elve o'clock. I used quinine, but to no purpose ; and finally I placed 
him upon arsenic, giving six drops of Fowler's solution thrice a day. 
Once a week four leeches were applied over the injured part of the 
musculo-spiral nerve. The injections were only used when excess of 
pain demanded them, but an opium plaster was placed over the outside 
of the arm and fore-arm. These means proved successful, and the pain 
slowly subsided, after having lasted unchanged for four months. Ex- 
actly five months after the injury, his condition was as follows : — Exten- 
sor power nearly perfect ; no pain in hand ; skin on outside of fore-arm 
a little sore to the touch, and subject to slight daily pain, increased by 
fatigue and damp weather. The nerve tracks were still sore, but not 
excessively so. At this time he began to have pain in the shoulder, 
tenderness below it, and distinct loss of power in the deltoid muscle. 
These new symptoms followed great exposure to bad weather, and were 
synchronous with a fresh attack of neuralgia. As he was now well and 
strong, as to general health, I put cut cups about his shoulder, and fol- 
lowed their use by a blister dressed with morphia. At the same time I 
confined him rigorously to his bed. These measures relieved the pain, 
but the feebleness of the deltoid increased, and the muscle lost bulk, so 
that, at the close of a month from this fresh attack, he could raise the 
arm but six inches outwards from the side. Two weeks later, these 
changes ceased, and he began to improve so rapidly that, except the 
exhibition of small doses of arsenic and local frictions, there was no oc- 
casion for more active treatment. I believe that this rapid relief was 
largely due to the coming on of warm spring weather. When last I 
saw him, early in the summer of 1865, he was suffering trifling pain in 
the arm at rare intervals. There was no pain in the shoulder, but the 
deltoid was still a little flattened, and the extended arm could be raised 
only to the level of the shoulder. 

Looking at the anatonn'cal relations of the musculo-spiral to the cir- 
cumflex nerve, it seems fair to infer that the disease which first involved 
the former came finally by direct propagation to affect the latter. So 
far as the mere symptoms can inform us, such would seem to be, in 
this case at least, the true explanation of the secondary affection which 
fell upon the shoulder. 

No opportunity has been afforded me of studying the morbid anat- 
omy of nerves supposed to be thus altered ; but I think the evidence in 
favor of directly propagated nerve change quite sufficient to render this 
view a probable one, while, for the idea of its being a reflex affection, 
there is simply no evidence at all.

Perhaps I shall make more clear what is to follow if I state here 
an imaginary case of nerve wound, in which the various 
phenomena are related in the order in w^hich they are 
usually found to occur : — 
" A ball wound of the lefl brachial plexus. Constitutional shock. Re- 
covery in an hour. Total absence of motion in the left arm, and nearly 
complete of sensation. Return of latter in a few hours, except in me- 
dian nerve distribution. Slower return of motor power, and, within ten 
days, limitation of loss to median supply. Wound heals in six weeks, 
and at this time burning pain is felt in parts supplied by the nerve above 
named. Slight neuralgic pains in fore-arm. Gradual atrophy of cer- 
tain muscles, with more or less contraction, and accompanying joint 
lesions further limiting mobility. Increase of burning pain with defec- 
tive nutrition of nails and skin. After three or four months the pain 
decreases, the muscular changes increase, the joints are no better, and 
we have finally as much difficulty from these secondary troubles as from 
absolute loss of neural supply, because, even if the latter be good, we 
must relieve the joints, stimulate nutrition in the thinned muscles, and

elongate some of them, before the return of nerve power can be made 
useful." 

Such is a brief sketch of what may take place after a wound of 
an important nerve. Of course, this schedule may be variously 
modified, as sensation, motion, or nutrition are more or less de- 
ranged, but it will suffice to point out the most important facts, 
and to indicate what was practically unknown before our own re- 
searches ; namely, that loss of motor power, in a vast majority of 
cases, is finally due less to neural defects than to those obstinate con- 
sequences in the range of nutrition which result from the loss of 
nerve power, and which may continue long after the motor power has 
been partially or completely regained. 

I shall now proceed to study in detail the various phenomena 
already alluded to, illustrating them by cases which have not hith- 
erto appeared in print. 

CHANGES IN THE NUTRITION OF PAETS THE NERVES OF WHICH 
HAVE BEEN INJURED. 

These affect the muscles and areolar tissue, the skin, the nails, 
and the hair. 

The most complete instances of general muscular atrophy of 
a member are presented in cases where entire and per- Muscular 
manent division of a nerve has occurred. Some strange ^*'''*P^y- 
illustrations of this alteration are to be found among the casts 
made at the hospital for injuries, etc., of the nervous system, 
and now deposited in the army medical museum. The alteration 
is best seen, however, in cases where a single group of muscles 
has suffered, as those of the thenar eminence, or the interosseal 
muscles, or the deltoid. Nothing more grotesque can be conceived 
of than some of the results thus produced. One in particular was 
most remarkable, the man having atrophy of the rhomboid, trape- 
zius, latissimus dorsi, and pectoral muscles on both sides. The 
arms continued strong, and when, by the aid of the deltoids and 
arm-muscles, these members w^ere elevated, the shoulder blades, 
uncontrolled by the action of the back-muscles, stood out at nearly 
a right angle from their usual plane of repose. This odd appear- 
ance gained for the man the soubriquet of the angel. I should add 
that it was not due to a wound, but was said to have followed a 
severe attack of measles. It has been often asked whether mere 
disuse may not account for muscular atrophy. I do not think it 
will. The most entire disuse in muscles palsied by apoplexy will 
not suffice to give rise to any thing more than slight thinning of 



426 NUTRIENT NERVE FIBRES. 

the part, and sometimes not even to this. In fact, traumatic palsy 
does not always produce atrophy even when the loss of power is 
complete, although this combination is certainly a rare event. 

The first effect of a nerve lesion is to occasion in the muscle a 
soft and flabby state of its tissue. Soon or late, in most instances, 
wasting follows, and, finally, shortening ensues. It is the latter 
condition which is the parent of most of the deformities seen after 
nerve wounds. 

It will not be out of place at this point to add a few words as to 
Muscular othcr forms of morbid muscular contractions which are 
contractions. ^^^ ^j^]^ ^^^^ ^^ j^gg frequently. 

When one group of muscles has lost motor power, its opponent 
group, not being paralyzed, may undergo a shortening due to want 
of antagonism. This is well seen in the partial palsies of child- 
hood. Of course, under these circumstances, the muscles origin- 
ally paralyzed become lengthened. In some cases this elongation 
remains ; in others the muscles shorten as their atrophy proceeds, 
and the healthy group is thus restored again to its usual length. 
I have seen this series of changes occur ; but sometimes when the 
healthy group is vigorous, and especially if it be a set of flexors, 
the atrophic contraction of the palsied muscles fails to restore the 
balance. 

In very rare cases a nerve wound gives rise to tonic spasm of a 
muscle or muscles. Inhalation of anaesthetics temporarily 

Tonic spasms. , ,. n«iii . 

relaxes this spasm ; but, aiter it has lasted some time, 
organic changes occur in the muscular tissues, the forms of the 
joints alter, and then no agent will fully relax the part. It was 
in the early stage of certain of these cases that we found benefit 
from the subdermal injection of atropia. 

The reader will easily comprehend the practical embarrassments 
in treatment which may arise out of the various forms of mus- 
cular changes. In a large proportion of patients they constitute 
the chief barrier to a perfect cure, and in many instances forbid 
the use of prothetic apparatus such as would otherwise enable the 
sufferer to make fair use of the injured member. 

In the little volume so often referred to, we pointed out the con- 
Distinct nu- elusion to which the above described phenomena led us. 
fibres. It still appcars clear to me, in the light of a larger expe- 

rience, that these facts support the modern idea of the existence of 
a distinct set of nutrient nerve fibres, whose implication in the 
wound occasions the alterations in question. This theory receives 
further support from the effect of wounds upon the nutrition of the 
skin and its appendages. 



EFFECT OF NEKVE WOUNDS UPON THE SKIN. 427 

Bed-sores, the result of pressure upon palsied parts, have long 
been recognized, but, if we except Mr. Paget's brief statements, 
no previous author has described the changes which some nerve 
wounds bring about in the extremities, — changes, I should add, 
which are not due to pressure, but originate spontaneously, no 
matter how carefully the part has been guarded. Complete divis- 
ion of all the nerves of a limb is apt to occasion, first, a slight 
oedema, and, more remotely, a ragged or patchy skin, with dry sur- 
face, and sometimes a yellow or brownish tint. The nails also 
become curved ; but none of these alterations are so curious as 
those which arise fi*om partial nerve injuries. 

In Mr. Paget's cases, two in number, the symptoms- of which I 
am about to speak coexisted with ordinary neuralgic pains of great 
obstinacy. In our cases the neuralgia was not constant, but 
burning pains (causalgia) were always present. I quote below the 
account which we gave of this extraordinary and hitherto unde- 
scribed group of symptoms. It constitutes, in fact, a malady by 
itself, and since our publication has been everywhere recognized as 
a novel form of disease. 

" Effect of Wounds on the Nutrition of the Skin and its Appendages. — 
So far as we are aware, only one author has spoken of the singular in- 
fluence of nerve wounds upon the skin. Many have described the bed- 
sores which arise in paralysis, especially in spinal cases, from pressure 
on the sacrum, elbows, and other prominent parts. 

" The changes in the skin which follow wounds of nerve trunks differ 
from these in an essential respect. They are of spontaneous origin, 
and are not brought about by pressure. Two distinct varieties are ob- 
servable. 

" The first is the result of entire division of the nerves of a part, and 
is best exhibited in cases of total palsy of a whole limb. Early in the 
case it is found associated in most instances with oedema, and is one of 
the remotest effects of the loss of nervous influence. The skin becomes 
thickened and dry, the epithelium hangs in patches here and there, and 
is yellow or even pale brown in tint. These peculiarities are in part 
owing to mere disuse, but this in no way applies to the changed form of 
the nails, which become curved as in tubercular disease, although to a 
less degree than in the other form of cutaneous affection, which is caused 
by partial injuries of the nerves. In fact, it may be stated as a rule, 
that the skin and subcuticular tissues are less strikingly altered in entire 
paralysis than in cases of a lighter nature. 

" The second form of pathological change in the skin and its append- 
ages is that which has heretofore escaped attention, if we except the 
slight notice of that most able pathologist, Mr. Paget. 



428 EFFECT OF NERVE WOUNDS UPOK THE SKIN. 

" In a recent paper, (" Medical Times and Gazette," London, March 
26, 1864), Mr. Paget speaks as follows : ' Glossy fingers appear to be 
a sign of peculiarly impaired nutrition and circulation due to injury of 
the nerves. They are not observed in all cases of injured nerves, and 
I cannot tell what are the peculiar conditions of the cases in which they 
are found ; but they are a very notable sign, and are always associated, 
I think, with distressing and hardly manageable pain and disability. 
In well-marked cases, the fingers which are affected (for this appearance 
may be confined to one or two of them) are usually tapering, smooth, 
hairless, almost void of wrinkles, glossy, pink or ruddy, or blotched as 
if with permanent chilblains. They are commonly also very painful, 
especially on motion, and pain often extends from them up the arm. In 
most of the cases this condition of the fingers is attended with very 
distinct neuralgia both in them and in the whole arm, and its relation 
to disturbance of the nervous condition of the part is, morever, indicated 
by its occasional occurrence in cases where neuralgia continues after an 
attack of shingles affecting the arm. In two such cases I have seen 
this same condition of the fingers well marked, and only very slowly 
subsiding, and seeming unaffected by the ordinary treatment of neu- 
ralgia.' 

" That the author quoted regards these conditions as rare and of in- 
terest, is the best reason why we should minutely describe them. How 
very common they are as results of gunshot wounds, may be gathered 
from the fact, that in fifty, partial nerve lesions they existed in different 
degrees in nineteen cases. 

"No particular time can be named as the period at which these 
changes in nutrition first show themselves. This alone can be said, they 
do not belong to cases of complete destruction of the nerves. They 
occur in such as have received slight or severe nerve wounds, provided 
always that these latter do not separate the part entirely from its nerve 
centres. They may begin within a few days, or at any later date ; but 
usually they arise while the wound is healing, and are in many instances 
distinctly related to the occurrence of inflammatory accidents in or 
about the wound. 

" The duration of this condition is various. It may be slight and dis- 
appear in a few weeks, or more rarely it may last for many months, and 
be very rebellious. 

" In a large part of the cases now under study the palm of the hand 
was the part most affected, but in others quite as severe, the fingers 
suffered. The feet were also liable, but never so remarkably as the 
hands. 

" Glossy Skin. — The skin affected in these cases was deep-red or 
mottled, or red and pale in patches. The epithelium appeared to have 
been partially lost, so that the cutis was exposed in places. The sub- 
cuticular tissues were nearly always shrunken, and where the palm 



EFFECT OF NERVE WOUNDS UPON THE SKIN. 429 

ilone was attacked, the part so diseased seemed to be a little depressed 
ind firmer, and less elastic than common. In the fingers there were 
)ften cracks in the altered skin, and the integuments presented the 
appearance of being tightly drawn over the subjacent tissues. The 
surface of all the affected part was glossy, and shining as though it had 
been skillfully varnished. Nothing more curious than these red and 
shining tissues can be conceived of In most of them the part was 
devoid of wrinkles and perfectly free from hair. Mr. Paget's comparison 
of chilblains, is one which we often used to describe these appearances ; 
but in some instances we have been more strikingly reminded of the 
characters of certain large, thin, and highly polished scars. 

" Where a single nerve, as the ulnar, had been attacked, the described 
state of skin was seen only in its ultimate distribution ; but in other 
instances of more extensive nerve injury, the central palm sufiered, or 
a single finger, or the pulps of all of them. In others the palm or fin- 
gers were dotted with islets of thin and red and glossy skin. The 
dorsum of the hand, as a rule, was in that member the part least sub- 
ject to the alteration, while the dorsum of the foot was in that region 
the part most liable to suffer. Do the greater functional endowments 
of the palm of the hand, as compared to the sole of the foot, account 
for this preference ? 

'■'Eczema. — A very constant feature of this state of skin was the oc- 
currence of eczematous eruptions, which appeared as minute vesicles 
thickly scattered over the thin and tender cutis, or else showed them- 
selves in successive crops of larger vesicles on tfie skin about the altered 
parts, with usually a preference for the portions which lay nearer the 
trunk. 

" In some patients this symptom was absent, in others it was never 
wholly lost, but varied in amount ; while in a small number it came and 
went, being absent for weeks at a time, and then returning. It was also 
remarkable in these latter, that recurrence of the eruption gave ease to 
certain painful symptoms to be presently described, or, to speak more 
cautiously, when the eczema came back the pain declined. 

" We have spoken of this eruption as eczematous ; but it is difficult 
to describe accurately, in ordinary terms, an appearance which presents 
itself on surfaces so diseased. The reader will certainly have recalled 
to mind by our statements, the herpetic and other forms of skin disease 
which are sometimes seen to accompany neuralgic affections. 

" At the close of this section of our subject will be found a number 
of cases illustrating the various phenomena which we have described. 
Among these is the case of Schively, No. 18. It is an admirable exam- 
ple of the presence of eruptions associated with depraved nutrition. 
We mention it here only to call attention to the fact that the right hand 
was the injured member, and that eczema appeared secondarily in the 
lefl palm, and was relieved by the treatment which was addressed to 
the right limb. Was this a case of reflex influence ? 



430 EFFECT OF NERVE WOUNDS UPON THE SKIN. 

"7%e Nails and Hair. — When the depraved nutritive state has lasted 
for some months, the hair commonly disappears from the fingers affected, 
and the nails undergo remarkable alterations. They suffer only in the 
fingers the neural supply of which has been interfered with, so that the 
nails in the median distribution may be contorted, and those in the little 
finger be unaffected. The alteration in the nail consists of a curve in 
its long axis, an extreme lateral arching, and sometimes a thickening 
of the cutis beneath its extremity. In other instances a change takes 
place which is quite peculiar, and which to us at least was new. The 
skin at that end of the nail next to the third finger-joint becomes re- 
tracted, leaving the sensitive matrix partly exposed. At the same time 
the upper line of union of skin and nail retreats into or under the latter 
part, and, in place of a smooth edge, is seen through the nail as a rag- 
ged and notched border. The patient who presented these changes in 
the most striking form had also lateral arching of the nail, but no lon- 
gitudinal curving. It was a case of the most terrible suffering, from a 
combination of burning pain in the hand, and neuralgic pain in the 
fore-arm. 

" No deformity of the nails in tubercle at all approaches that which 
nerve wounds occasion. Indeed, we think it would be possible for one 
familiar with these cases to diagnose the existence of a nerve lesion 
from the form of these protuberant and oddly curved nails. 

" When the nails of the toes have been attacked, and they are very 
rarely so, the curving is less marked, but a distressing ulceration is apt 
to occur at their angles, and to break out again and again, despite of 
every care and attention. 

" The best remedy then is excision of the outer edges of the nail, ma- 
trix and all. This has given permanent relief in a number of our 
patients. 

" Before passing to the discussion of other parts of the same subject, 
we must confess that it is almost impossible, without a colored plate, to 
convey any clear idea of the worst cases of these cutaneous lesions. 
To see them is sufficient to impress one with the idea that their very pe- 
culiar appearances have no exact likenesses anywhere else in the patho- 
logical states to which the skin is subject. In the cases of glossy skin 
where there was no marked hypersesthesia as to pain, the patient seemed 
to have healthy power of tact throughout the altered tissues. In others, 
though rarely, there was partial tactile paralysis. We may therefore 
infer that the change in the skin arises from agencies which may or 
may not be associated with conditions which disturb the nerves of 
touch." ^

has reported other instances of eruptions supervening on neural- 
gia, and one resembling pemphigus, which resulted from an abscess 
i of the fore-arm. Other cases are related ,by Notta^ and Parratt.^ 
The most illustrative case of herpes known to me occurred in 
the practice of my friend Dr. Keating, who has kindly q^ ^f 
jplaced it at my disposal : — ^^^* 

' " C. B , aged forty-three, banker, in good health, was attacked with 
a copious eruption of herpes, which covered the left arm and shoulder, 
and was accompanied with intense darting neuralgia of these parts, as 
well as the hand. The herpes disappeared in three weeks, but the pain 
continuing at the close of the fourth week, he began to complain of 
feebleness of the limb. This increased to such an extent as to result in 
almost total paralysis, which included the fore-arm and the pectoral 
group of muscles. Meanwhile the pain diminished, and during the 
second and third month the muscles underwent very marked atrophy, 
which was most notable in the shoulder group, and in the biceps. 
The neuralgia finally disappeared altogether, although the motor palsy 
lasted at least four to five months, being relieved, and at last cured, by 
the aid of faradization." 

We have thus a case of herpes with not merely neuralgia, but 
also with paralysis of quite an obstinate character. I do not 
know of any other history which presented this peculiar association 
of symptoms. 

Since my experience in connection with defective nutrition 
caused by nerve wounds, I have paid more attention to this sub- 
ject in cases of paralyses from central organic disease. Without 
entering fully into the matter, I shall venture to relate a very in- 
teresting case which has fallen under my notice.

432 INTERESTING CASE OF PARALYSIS. 

distress and annoyances of various kinds. In 1859, Mrs. S. had a fall, 
in which she struck the back of her neck. Two weeks later she felt 
suddenly a dull but severe pain between her shoulders. Within a few 
days this extended into the arms, with dragging and tearing pains down 
to the wrists. A few months later the pains attacked the legs, and 
were accompanied by violent cramps. About this time she had indis- 
tinct articulation; but this did not endure. The intellect was clear 
throughout the case. The next symptom was feebleness in the legs, 
which increased until she ceased to walk. She has since remained on 
a couch or in bed. After a year, as well as can be recalled, her feet 
and hands became contracted. The toes were flexed, the feet extended. 
The fingers became slowly flexed to a right angle with the palm, the 
index finger remaining extended. The thumb was drawn tightly into 
the palm, and the fingers were extended on themselves. Sensation is 
said to have been normal at all times. It is now entire everywhere. 
On the ulnar half of the palm, in both hands, the skin is dark-red, 
shining, and glazed. It is in these parts exquisitely tender to the touch, 
and is the seat of a constant causalgia or burning pain. The soles also 
burn, but are not red nor shining. All the motions are limited by the 
contractions, but there does not seem to be any distinct paralysis. 
The flexors of the toes are somewhat atrophied, but still have voluntary 
motion. Bowels always costive, never being moved without enema. 
Urine passed with difficulty, and for some years requiring now and 
then the use of a catheter ; urine cloudy, from deposits of urates ; very 
rarely uric acid sediment ; it is always acid ; the specific gravity aver- 
age of four specimens of mixed urine of whole day, 1025 ; no albumen 
or sugar. Tubercle in left lung, cough, and hectic. These are symp- 
toms only of the last five months. Nutrition — general wasting. The 
great toes were subject to occasional ulcers at their angles during the 
first two years of her malady. The three external fingers on each 
hand have a disease of the matrix of the nails, resulting in a thinning 
and irregular growth of the nails. No incurvation. 

The affection of the teeth is very curious. They were formerly reg- 
ular, white, of even length, and touching one another. They are now 
very unequal in length, and diverge from one another, so that the space 
of four lines exists between the two anterior upper incisors. They 
also seem to be turned on their long axes and all are of a deep yellow, 
despite the most assiduous care. I should add that none are loose. I 
do not know that I can fully describe the curious appearance pre- 
sented by this patient's mouth. It strongly impressed me with the 
idea that there had been disease of the alveolar sockets, something 
akin to that which is met with in the matrices of certain diseased 
nails. 

My patient died in November, 1865. To my regret, no post-mortem 
examination could be had. 



I 



HYPERTROPHY FROM NERVE WOUND. 433 



It appears to me that this case is a good example of causalgia, 
shining palms, and depraved nutrition of teeth and nails, probably 
originatnig in central spinal disease. I do not think that these 
changes liave hitherto been noted except in connection with in- 
juries or disease of extra-central nerve brandies. In some re- 
spects it resembles a set of cases reported by a very able observer, 
M. Charcot, in the " Union Medicale," 1866. 

I have encountered an exceptional case, in which a nerve wound 
appeared to have occasioned a very curious hypertrophic Hypertro- 
state of the areolar tissues of the hand. This patient fi'/trssu^of 
was seen by my friend. Dr. Morehouse, after I had ^ound'^r 
ceased to attend at the hospital. Dr. M. was so struck '^^''''^• 
with the singularity of the affection, that he sent the man to my 
house, where he was also seen by Dr. Packard, who pointed out 
the resemblance between the condition of his hand and that of a 
person afflicted with elephantiasis. I have met with no other case 
in the least degree like this one, and I am altogether at a loss to 
explain the true cause of his disease. Like most of his fellows, 
he passed from under our care long before he became well, there- 
fore I can give only an unfinished liistory of his case. 

" Hypertrophy caused by Nerve Wound. — John Graham, Company E, 
116th New York. Wounded in left arm, October 19, 1864. Entry, 
three inches below axilla on posterior face ; exit, two inches below ax- 
illa anteriorly. Arm dropped. He fell bleeding freely and very faint. 
Very early in the case his first and second finger and thumb slowly en- 
larged without other inflammatory signs, and with slight, darting pains. 
After the wound healed, these parts increased still more, and became 
firm and dark-purple in tint. At the same time the darting pains in- 
creased. For several months he had causalgia, but not severely. Two 
months after the wound, the skin of the affected parts peeled off en 
masse. 

" When I saw him, seven months after the injury, there was no feeling 
in the first, second, and half of the third finger, and in the front of the 
thumb. The first and second finger were moveless, chiefly from their size 
and stiffness. The thumb could be slightly stirred. There was a good 
deal of neuralgia in these parts, and their skin was dry, scaly, and yel- 
low. The enlargement above alluded to was chiefly confined to the 
thumb and first two fingers, but it also involved the dorsum of the 
hand, being most developed on the radial half. Perhaps it was most 
striking in the thumb. There was a little oedema of the ulnar palm 
and dorsum, but elsewhere the parts were hard and unimpressible by 
the finger. The skin itself appeared to be thickened, and was very 
dark throughout the extent of the affected portions of the member."

434 EFFECT ON SECKETIONS. 

Another very interesting peculiarity of nerve lesions, and one 
luflammation ^f no rare occurrence, is subacute inflammation of the 
of joints. joints. At first I supposed it to be due to general 
oedema of the limb, or to be a relic of the early traumatic inflam- 
mation. These ideas were abandoned, however, as soon as the 
presence of a number of cases in our wards enabled us to study 
them with greater success. 

Since the publication of our essay on nerve lesions, nearly all of 
our statements in regard to the nutritive changes in the skui, nails, 
hair, and joints, have been amply confirmed by the recent ex- 
perience of many European observers. Perhaps the most remark- 
able of the lately published cases is No. 35 of the series given by 
Dr. Annandale.^ Other confirmatory statements may be met witli 
in Tillaux.^ 

Very early, or at any time after the first few days, the joints of 
a wounded limb may become swollen and painful to the touch or 
on movement. After a time, the pain and tenderness lessen, but 
the joints remain stiff and enlarged for months or years. As to 
their final fate, I have no information, since in every case the 
patient passed from under our care. 

I have vainly sought to find any single point as to which these 
joints differ in appearance from those affected by subacute rheu- 
matism. Nor, indeed, as has elsewhere been urged, are we even 
now sure that rheumatism is not of neural origin. Dr. Gull has 
lately pointed out some interesting facts in this connection ; but, as 
is well known to American physicians, he was long ago anticipated 
by the late Prof. J. K. Mitchell.3

We observed that with complete loss of innervation the skin was 
dry, so that, in some cases, the boundary lines of healthy innerva- 
tion could be defined by the limits of the cutaneous moisture. In 
some instances of partial nerve injury, there were copious sweats 
which were intensely acid, so that the man smelled of vinegar. In 
a single instance the odor was disgustingly heavy, like the stench 
from a foul drain. 

T have recently encountered a case of an officer in whom a ball 
wound had injured severely the nerves of the left shoulder. The

LESIONS^ OF SENSATION". . 435 

axilla was insensible to the touch, and, as he observed, had none 
of the usual odor of that part. 

For cases illustrative of the nutritive changes which I have here 
dwelt upon, I refer the reader to the close of the paper. 

LESIONS OF SENSATION. 

I do not remember to have jnet with a single case of wound of 
the nerves of a limb where there was loss of motion without some 
alteration of the sense of tact or that of pain. This is only cu- 
rious when we see how slight is sometimes the sensory lesion as 
compared to that of motion, and how much less enduring than the 
latter. 

We may study this subject under the following heads : — 
Hyperagsthetic Conditions ; ciassmca- 

Anaesthetlc Conditions ; iSnlof 

Neuralgia — inclusive of *°«**^*'°- 

Causalgia (Burning pain). 

Hypersesthesia of the sense of tact is not to be met with in 
cases of nerve wounds. It is also uncommon to encoun- Hyperaesthe- 
ter exaggerated sense of pain, apart from inflammation, "*• 
or from that strange form of skin disease described by us, and to 
be presently more fully dwelt upon. While cutaneous hyperaas- 
thesia is so infrequent, it is common enough to see instances of 
muscular hypersesthesia, a condition upon which Briquet has in- 
sisted as a symptom of hysteria. Elsewhere it has usually escaped 
recognition. It is found very often in nerve wounds, and is almost 
the sole symptom in some cases of spinal shock. In the latter as- 
sociation it was most amenable to the lonoj-continued use of bromide 
of potassium in large doses. When occurring in connection with 
nerve wounds, it needs no special treatment, as it disappears with 
the lapse of time, and even when present offers no important ob- 
stacle to treatment. 

It is, however, a point of some interest to determine the exist- 
ence of the symptom in question. We may detect it by pinching 
the muscles, or by deep pressure, so as to ehcit an unusual feeling 
of soreness which, in some cases, is very acute. At the same time, 
if we pinch the skin, or the skin and subcuticular tissues in .the same 
locality, no such pain is complained of. 

Ancesthetic Conditions. — Defective sense of touch or of pain are 
found to exist in most nerve wounds. In a large num- Anaesthesia 
ber it was observed that both senses alike suffered, but in gSa^°^^' 
rare cases the one was injured and the other unimpaired. It was 



436 ANESTHETIC CONDITIONS. 

further noted that, as I have already pointed out, sensation is apt 
to return long before motility is restored. I quote from op. cit., 
p. 97, the following as the only explanation of this remarkable fact 
which I can offer : — 

" When a function is partially paralyzed, its continued exercise is one 
of the conditions of its ultimate return to full activity so soon as the 
neural injury has become repaired, ^ow, the sense of touch is in con- 
stant automatic use, so to speak ; every contact is a new stimulus, and 
the very fact of deficient feeling subjects the part to rough and unusual 
irritations. It does not seem incredible that this may explain, in part 
at least, the early disappearance of sensory paralysis in cases where the 
function of sensation appears to be quite as much affected at the outset 
as that of motility. 

" In regard to voluntary movement the case is quite different. When 
muscles are paralyzed partially, an effort of will, and a greater one than 
common, is demanded to call them into action. The early inflammatory 
conditions make motion painful. The effort is unusually wearisome, 
and there is no inevitable and constant stimulus, such as exists in re- 
gard to touch. Hence, perhaps, it is that motility is regained less 
easily than sensibility, although beyond all this there are also certain 
mechanical obstacles in the way of a return of voluntary movement, 
which vary greatly, and constitute every single case a special object of 
study. We may sum up the matter in this brief shape. The skin is 
all the time stimulated, whether we will or not. The muscles which 
volition has ceased to move with ease have no such incidental stimulus. 
Accident and position do for the skin what artificial medical agencies 
must do for the muscles, if we desire to sustain their nutrition and 
restore their power." 

In determining the amount of loss of sensation in the early 
stages of a wounded limb, it is important to bear in mind how 
rapid and complete may sometimes be the disappearance of this 
symptom, and it is also unsafe to conclude that there is perfect 
anaesthesia or analgesia until the skin has been thoroughly exam- 
ined with the aid of the induced electric current and the wire 
brush. I have again and again detected by this means in wounded 
limbs, or in those otherwise palsied, some relics of sensibihty. 
And while the electric wire brush is of diagnostic value, it is also 
capable, in many instances, of recalling sensation to affected parts 
in a way which is so striking as to have often excited my astonish- 
ment. 

Where lesser lesions of sensation exist, they should be studied 
with the aid of the aesthesiometer, and the amount and extent of 
defective feeling recorded for future comparison. 



SLOW PASSAGE OF NEURAL IMPRESSIONS. 437 

There is yet another point of interest in connection with injuries 
of sensation which in time may possibly come to have Delay m 
vahie as regards the differential diagnosis of paralysis. 5 seSuons 

It has occurred to me, as to others, to observe that in ^°^ voutiou. 
some partial paralyses depending upon certain pathological states of 
the spinal cord an impression made on the skin of the affected limb 
requires some seconds to elapse before it is felt by the brain. I 
have carefully measured with a metronome the time thus required, 
and found it to be in the worst case I have seen eight seconds. In 
another, an instance of spinal shock from fall, it was five seconds. 
In like manner, the mandates of the will were equally retarded 
in their passage to the paralyzed muscles. I incline to the belief 
that in cerebral paralysis this phenomenon is less distinctly marked, 
and at all events it will be well to examine the subject with a 
larger range of cases than has fallen under my eye since I sus- 
pected this difference to exist. 

In the few instances of lesion of nerve trunks which I have re- 
cently encountered, I have examined this point with great care. 
Of course such observations are possible only in cases of partial 
loss of sensation. In these I have found but a very slight retar- 
dation in the time required for a sensory impression to reach the 
brain — so slight a time indeed as to be measurable with difficulty, 
or not at all. At all events there was nothing comparable to the 
retardation which I have found in spinal paralysis. I am naturally 
led to suspect that in order to produce this effect there must be an 
injury of some of the ganglionic layers through which excitations 
of a distal nerve must pass in the spine before they can ascend to 
the brain itself. 

I state these very interesting facts, and my deduction therefrom, 
with just that amount of doubt which ought rightly to exist where 
the range of observation has been necessarily limited. I am con- 
fident, however, that in the partial anaesthesias from injury of nerve 
trunks which I have lately seen, there was no such delaying of the 
passage of impressions as occurred in the cases of spinal paralysis 
which have fallen under my care, so that in any case this discrep- 
ancy would remain to be accounted for, even should future expe- 
rience exhibit instances of distal lesions in which there may exist 
such a loss of time in transmitting sensations. 

I am tempted here to make one remark in regard to glow passage 
the slow passage of neural impressions in injuries of the tweJ^L 
medulla spinalis. It appears to me to be of great impor- SJmeduiif 
tance, and to have escaped the notice of physiologists. 'p^°''"'- 



438 KETAKDATION OF ELECTRICAL CURRENTS. 

So far as I am aware, the retardation of electrical impressions by 
Retardation clcfccts of conduction, cven in wires of OT-eat length, is 

of electrical o c> ' 

cuneuts. msasurable only by fractions of seconds. But in the 
case of certain spinal lesions affecting the integrity of neural con- 
duction we have a delay of from five to eight seconds, on conduct- 
ors not over four or five feet long. Does not this fact separate 
nerve force from electric force by a boundary wider than has yet 
been supposed to exist. 

Experiments are yet needed, however, as to the possible amount 
of retardation in electricity of low tension traversing conductors 
of such feeble power of transmission as the nerve fibres present. 

If the difference which I have described between nerve lesion 
and ganglionic lesions be substantiated, it is possible that we may 
thus obtain a novel method of differentially diagnosing diseases of 
the centres from those of the conducting cords. 

At the risk of theorizing, beyond what the facts admit of, I am 
tempted to state one fact in electricity which may help a little to 
clear up our ideas as to the mode in which ganglionic injury may 
lessen the power of neural transmission, and by enfeebling the 
current make it impossible to impress the sensorium so as to record 
an impression until some little time shall have elapsed. 

When a current of electricity is made to pass across or through 
a second battery of a number of cells, and when one or more of 
these has its elements, as zinc and copper, reversed, the current is 
singularly enfeebled. 

Now, it is not impossible that in cases of spinal commotion or 
disease some such dislocation of ganglion cells may take place as to 
cause a like w^eakening of the current. I do not wish to express 
myself as discerning any absolute identity between the tw^o sets of 
conditions here stated, but it does seem to me as though the one 
might aid us at least to understand how the other could occur. 

As a general rule, when a great nerve has been injured by a 
ball, the sense of pain, of touch, and of temperature, as well as 
the power to move, all sufter loss in varying degrees, and usually 
are most affected at the outset. In cases of injury. to a nerve from 
contusion, or from gradual pressure, or even from disease, it is 
usually sensation which is first and alone attacked. Loss of mo- 
tility, if it come at all, comes much later, and commonly with- 
out any previous display of convulsive movements in the muscles 
whose nerves have been altered. Interesting examples of this se- 
quence are to be met with in the " crutch palsy," previously de- 
scribed, and which must often have been seen by our hospital sur- 



BURNING PAIN, OR CAUSALGIA. 439 

:his malady, numbness and loss of sensation precede the 
paralysis, and are sufficient to warn us of the danger which is sure 

K follow if the case be neglected. 
Neuralgic and other pains are among the most common symp- 
ms of nerve wounds, and are, perhaps, of all others, the most 
permanent. They assume every possible variety of type, and 
differ so little from ordinary neuralgia as to need but httle notice 
here. 

Causalgia. — There is, however, one species of pain arising out 
of nerve wounds which had never been described except Burning 
by my colleagues and myself, although the state of skin p^*°" 
which is usually found with it had been spoken of by Mr. Paget, 
who seems to have seen it only in association with common neu- 
ralgic pains. In writing of this peculiar kind of suffering, I felt 
that it would be well to give it some more convenient name than 
merely " burning pain," and, in accordance with the suggestion of 
my friend. Professor Robley Dunglison, I have therefore adopted 
the term Causalgia as being both descriptive and convenient. 
The following extract from the volume on gunshot wounds, etc., 
by Drs. Morehouse, Keen, and myself, delmeates this disease so 
fully as to make it unnecessary to add to it : — 

" In an early experience of nerve wounds we met with a small num- 
ber of men who were suffering from a pain which they described as a 
' burning,' or as ^ mustard red-hot,' or as 'a red-hot file rasping the 
skin.' In all of these patients, and in many later cases, this pain was 
an associate of the glossy skin previously described. In fact, this state 
of skin never existed without burning pain. 

" Recently we have seen numbers of men who had burning pain with- 
out glossy skin, and in some we have seen this latter condition commen- 
cing. The burning comes first, the skin changes afterward ; but in no 
case of great depravity in the nutrient condition of the skin have we 
failed to meet with it, and that in its forms of almost unendurable an- 
guish. The terms here used may seem strong to those who have not 
encountered these cases ; but no one who has seen them will think that, 
as regards some of them, it would be possible to overstate their most 
wretched condition. 

" We have some doubt as to whether this form of pain ever originates 
at the moment of the wounding ; but we have been so informed as re- 
gards two or three cases. (See case 22.) Certain it is that, as a rule, 
the burning arises later, but almost always during the healing of the 
wound. Of the special cause which provokes it, we know nothing, ex- 
cept that it has sometimes followed the transfer of pathological changes 
from a wounded nerve to unwounded nei-ves, and has then been felt in 



440 CAUSALGIA. 

their distribution, so that we do not need a direct wound to bring it 
about. 

" The seat of burning pain is very various, but it never attacks the 
trunk, rarely the arm or thigh, and not often the fore-arm or leg. Its 
favorite site is the foot or hand. In these parts it is to be found most 
often where the nutritive skin changes are met Avith ; that is to say, on the 
palm of the hand, or palmar face of the fingers, and on the dorsum of 
the foot ; scarcely ever on the sole of the foot, or the back of the hand. 
Where it first existed in the whole foot or hand, it always remained last 
in the parts above referred to, as its favorite seats. 

" The great mass of sufferers described this pain as superficial, but 
others said it was also in the joints, and deep in the palm. If it lasted 
long, it was referred finally to the skin alone. 

" Its intensity varies from the most trivial burning to a state of tor- 
ture which can hardly be credited, but which reacts on the whole econ- 
omy, until the general health is seriously affected. 

" The part itself is not alone subject to an intense burning sensation, 
but becomes exquisitely hyperaesthetic, so that a touch or a tap of the 
finger increases the pain. Exposure to the air is avoided by the patient 
with a care which seems absurd, and most of the bad cases keep the 
hand constantly wet, finding relief in the moisture rather than in the 
coolness of the application. Two of these sufferers carried a bottle of 
water and a sponge, and never permitted the part to become dry for a 
moment. 

" As the pain increases, the general sympathy becomes more marked. 
The temper changes, and grows irritable ; the face becomes anxious, 
and has a look of uneasiness and suffering. The sleep is restless, and the 
constitutional condition, reacting on the wounded limb, exasperates the 
hyperaesthetic state, so that the rattling of a newspaper, a breath of air, 
another's step across the ward, the vibrations caused by a military band, 
or the shock of the feet in walking, give rise to increase of pain. At 
last, the patient grows hysterical, if we may use the only term which 
covers the facts. He walks carefully, carries the limb tenderly with the 
sound hand, is tremulous, nervous, and has all kinds of expedients for 
lessening the pain. In two cases, at least, the skin of the entire body 
became hyperaesthetic when dry, and the men found some ease from 
pouring water into their boots. They said, when questioned, that it 
made walking hurt less ; but how or why, unless by diminishing vibra- 
tion, we cannot explain. One of these men went so far as to wet the 
sound hand when he was obliged to touch the other, and insisted that 
the observer should also wet his hand before touching him, complaining 
that dry touch always exasperated his pain. 

" Cold weather usually eased these pains ; heat, and the hanging down 
of the limb, made them worse. Motion of the part was unendurable in 
some of the very worst cases ; but, for the most part, it did no harm, 
unless so excessive as to flush the injured region. 



DEFECT OF MOTION FROM NERVE WOUNDS. 441 

" The relations of burning pain to altered nutrition have already re- 
ceived attention from us. It appears quite certain that in cases of 
glossy skin, burning always exists. It is also certain that it may exist 
without association with diseased skin ; but that in these instances the 
evidence of depraved nutrient states will be very likely to follow upon 
the pain, should that symptom last very long. 

" The temperature of the burning part we have always found to be 
higher than that of surrounding parts, or than that of corresponding 
points on the other half of the body." 

I have met but one case in w^hich burning pain and shining skin 
coexisted with complete anaesthesia of the part affected. Burning 
In every other instance there was at least partial sense anaesthesia. 
of tact, and hyperaesthesia as to pain. We found also, that rem 
edies addressed to the diseased skin allftviated the pain, w^hile 
treatment of the distant wound or cicatrix gave no good results. 
Nor have I met with any person who, after having suffered ampu- 
tation*, complained of burning pain. I infer, therefore, that the 
pain is caused by some nerve change which occasions alterations in 
the distal circulation and nutrition, and that these, in turn, produce 
a state of the cutaneous nerves which gives rise to pain of a peculiar 
character. It appears to me, in some way, therefore, to be related 
to the depraved nutrition of the skin. If, in any case, we had been 
obliged to amputate a limb thus affected, the question would have 
been easily settled, since, if the burning were merely a referred 
sensation, like the pains caused by diseased nerves in a stump, the 
causalgia would have continued ; whilst, if it were the product of 
altered nutrition in distal parts, it would have disappeared, with the 
loss of the member. Illustrative cases will be found at the close 
of this paper, and at page 431 the reader will meet with an in- 
stance of glossy skin and burning apparently due to disease of the 
spinal centres. 

DEFECTS OF MOTION FROM WOUNDS OF NERVES. 

Nerve lesions affect the power to move a part in the followmg 
ways : — 

1. By occasioning muscular paralysis ; Different 

2. By producing contractions organic or functional ; Sh nerve 

3. By causing diseases of joints ; mXn**^^* 

4. By giving rise to long disuse. 

Class I. — A wound of a nerve occurs, and a number of 
muscles are paralyzed. Some of them recover rapidly ; 
others remain dead to volitional control for unlimited ^'''^^^'^'- 



442 KESULTS OF PARALYSIS. 

periods of time, and undergo secondary changes very injurious to 
the motihty of the Hmb. If the will has any, even the faintest, 
control over a muscle, it is hkely to improve ; but if the muscle 
grows flabby, becomes atrophied, and finally shortens, the progno- 
sis is bad. Early in the case, a thorough electric examination 
affords prognostic indications of value, as I shall elsewhere ])oint 
out more at length. 

Class II. — Results of Paralysis. — The first of these is short- 
shortening cuiug of tlic oppouciit group, if this bc Still witliiu the 
muscfeT^'' power of the will. With this comes a certain abruptness 
of motion, which occasions much awkwardness. If these changes 
be not provided against, the joints become altered ; and if at the 
same time they should be inflamed, as often happens, the final 
result is some deformity utterly intractable to treatment. The 
joint lesions occasion mischief in another way. Whether from pain 
or neglect, it is only too ofi:en found that a limb has been kept in 
some one position during several weeks after a wound, or even 
for a longer time. The result is a state of false anchylosis which 
is far worse than any which follows the prolonged use of splints 
and the absence of passive motion. 

Organic shortening, the frequent sequence of atrophy, when it 
prevents contraction of the opponent muscles, would do less harm 
— indeed it might seem desirable if it could be checked at a given 
limit ; but, unfortunately, it is apt to go on until it deforms the 
member, and gives rise to difficulties of a very interesting nature. 

When, for instance, as we have seen, the wrist flexors were 
greatly contracted, the hand was so drawn down that the flexors of 
the fingers could not shorten sufficiently to bend these parts at all. 
The moment we forcibly overcame the flexion of the wrist, the 
fingers could at once be bent, so that there was really no paralysis 
of these parts. 

Spasmodic affections are so rare as to be of little practical mo- 
ment. I have seen but few cases of tonic spasm. In 
pasm. those which presented themselves at the U. S. Army 
Hospital for Injuries of Nerves, etc., we observed that the affected 
muscle was always firm and plump ; that it remained sensitive to 
electricity, perhaps was even abnormally so ; and that iix one case 
at least it did not relax during sleep. Every attempt to extend it 
forcibly caused pain and more violent spasm. Indeed, in many 
instances of nerve wounds, there was a certain irritability of the 
muscles, which betrayed itself by pain and spastic contraction, 
when we moved the limb so as to elongate the muscle. Thus, if a 



PROGNOSIS OF NERVE WOUNDS. 443 

lexor muscle was so affected, passive extension of the limb pro- 

luced in it a spasm, and even volitional attempts at extension 

)ccasioned this result. Tremor was a common phenomenon in 

luscles which were partially palsied, or had been long disused. 

As regards the diagnosis of wounds of nerves, it may seem 

needless to say any thing. The points to determine are. Diagnosis

Whether there be loss of motility or sensibility, and of nerves. 
the extent and probable dm'ation of such loss — points most readily 
settled a few days after the date of the wound. Total and permanent 
abohtion of both functions may commonly be taken as evidence of 
actual division of the nerve, although I am sure that local shock 
may give occasion to great though less endui-ing results. While 
it is easy, therefore, to be sure that a nerve has been injured, 
we may often be at a loss to determine at once the extent of the 
lesion ; and it is always necessary to bear in mind the various ac- 
cidents or incidents of nerve wounds which lessen movement, with- 
out being directly dependent upon nerve injury. Of these I shall 
speak hereafter. 

As concerns prognosis, it is above all things important to delay 
the formation of an opinion for many months after the Prognosis of 

i "^^ wounds of 

wound has been received. For, even in a case of direct, nerves. 
though partial, section of great nerves, the accompanying local 
shock is often transient ; and besides this, no one can predict the 
extent to which nerve repair may proceed. So true is this, that 
it is not right to despair of a case until, at long intervals of months 
or years, repeated efforts have been made with electricity to recall 
the muscles into functional activity, and thus to utilize any favor- 
able changes in their nerves which may have been effected during 
these intervals. Increasing experience has taught me, indeed, that 
the most unfavorable cases are those in which slight wounds of 
nerve trunks have occasioned atrophic shortening of muscles, or, 
worst of all, the peculiar joint disease first described by my col- 
leagues and myself. Many of these cases are quite hopeless, and 
are certainly far more difficult to treat than simple loss of motility 
and feeling. I ought to add that I have followed none of these 
histories over more than three or four years, and therefore I can- 
not feel sure that they may not improve after longer periods of 
time have elapsed. 

Wounds of nerves produced by splinters of a bone shattered by 
a ball are apt to be intractable for obvious reasons. I have met 
with several instances of this form of injury in which every reme- 
dial agent failed to be of use.

of injury. regions. It IS well to be certam, m these cases, that no 
fragment of bone or ball has been driven against the more distant 
nerves which appear to be secondarily affected. The following 
case is not only a good instance of the possibility of such an oc- 
currence, but is in otlier respects a most instructive history : — 

Wm. Seymour, aged twenty, sailor. On May 5th, 1 865, in the Wilder- 
ness, while ramming a load, he was shot from the branches of 
a tree on his left. The ball entered one and a half inches im- 
mediately below the left auditory meatus, touching the lower lobe of the 
ear ; it slightly splintered the posterior angle of the lower jaw-bone, and 
passed across the throat much below the level of the tongue, though, as 
to its exact path, little is known. It made exit on the right side of the 
neck at a level with the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage, through 
the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, about one and a half inches above the 
clavicle, and two and a quarter inches from the middle line. He fell 
senseless, lay thus about an hour, and then, awakening, crept half a mile, 
as he thinks, both wounds bleeding in jets. He now filled the wounds 
with dust, and so checked the bleeding. He thinks both arms were at 
this time equally strong. The third night his wounds were dressed. 
Up to this time he had taken no food, and most of the water which he 
drank ran out of the right wound in the neck. He was taken to the 
Douglas Hospital on the 10 th May. Up to this date he ate nothing, 
and spoke in feeble whispers. 

At this point I insert the letter which Seymour brought with him 
from the distinguished surgeon in charge of the Douglas Hospital, Dr. 
Wm. Thompson, U. S. Army, at whose request the patient was trans- 
ferred to the U. S. Army Hospital for Diseases and Injuries of the 
Nervous System. 

After describing the wound, Dr. ThomjDSon adds : — 

" For a number of days he was nourished by injections of beef-tea, 
and by small quantities of milk introduced into the stomach through 
a catheter. He had had a severe hemorrhage on his way to the hos- 
pital. His wounds were dressed with cold water. 

'■'■May I'dth. — He had a secondary hemorrhage, and lost eight ounces 
of blood. This was checked by compression. 

^'May 26th. — Lost four ounces of arterial blood from the wound of 
exit and from the mouth. The wound of entry was closed. Small 
bleedings occurred each day upon the least exertion, until May 30th, 
when it became evident that some operation would be needed to save 
his life. The external compression had caused an accumulation of 
blood about the trachea and neck generally, which with other causes

connected with the wound, made suffocation appear imminent. He 
was anaesthetized, and an incision made for ligature of the right primi- 
tive carotid. I should add that at this time there was good pulsation 
in the right tempol-al artery. After patient and thorough search, no 
trace of the right carotid, the internal jugular vein, or the pneumo- 
gastric nerve, could be found. The incision was extended downwards, 
and the sternal attachment of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle divided. 
The opening in the neck was finally carried up to the parotid gland, 
and the region thus exposed was submitted to the closest scrutiny, but 
still without discovery of any large vessel. As the oozing continued, 
I made fruitless search for any thing large enough to tie, and at 
length filled the wound of exit with charpie, and left the patient to 
his fate. No further bleeding took place, and recovery was hencefor- 
ward rapid. 

*' For a long time there was complete aphonia, and after the operation 
he lost power in the right arm." 

Admitted at Turner's Lane Hospital, September 11th, 1864. 

The following particulars were elicited : — 

Wounds closed. Right arm : Sensation and motion feeble through- 
out the limb. I believe this to have been due to changes in the brachial 
plexus in the neck, consequent upon the operation. The neck has, from 
stiffness, only one quarter range of movement. Face : Touch is lost on 
right side of face, cheek, skin of lips, from half an inch in front of ear 
to line of external angle of right eye. Worst on edge of chin, fair on 
red part of lips, limited by middle line. Touch lessened on upper neck. 
Analgesia more or less complete, in all these parts. The nose is un- 
affected. Tongue : On the right side there is absolute loss of gustation, 
touch, pain, and sense of temperature. This defect is limited by the 
middle line. Very far back there seems to be considerable sensation. 
On the right side motion seems good — some of us thought entire ; and 
the right side of the tongue is firm, red, and well nourished. The left 
side of the tongue is paralyzed as to motion almost entirely. It is sofl, 
flabby, wrinkled, and atrophied, rolHng helplessly Avith the movement of 
the right muscles. The whole tongue, when at rest, lies straight in the 
mouth, but it cannot now be projected. When, early in the case, this 
was possible, it turned distinctly to the left side. Deglutition is im- 
perfect ; he has to take moistened food only, and coughs and chokes 
very frequently while eating. He is liable to fits of gaping when 
tired or over-heated. Voice nearly perfect. The eyes are healthy. 
There is no pain anywhere. The heart and lungs are sound. Appe- 
tite and digestion good. 

It is clear from the facts before us that the ball probably cut 
the left lingual nerve, and also the right lingual branches comments 
of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The former accident suf-

going case. 



446 TREATMENT AS REGARDS PAIN. 

ficed to palsy the left side of the tongue. The latter may be 
assumed to have had some share in the destruction of gustatory 
sensation on the right side of that organ ; but .these accidents ac- 
count neither for the accompanying total loss of tact and pain in 
the right side of the tongue, and still less for that of the external 
right side of the face. To paralyze sensation in the latter regions, 
there must have been either a secondary affection through induced 
disease of the centres, or else some wound of the nerve in ques- 
tion ; and if the latter took place far enough back, it would involve 
some of the branches of the fifth nerve, which go to the tongue, 
and some which supply the face. The question is answered, I 
think, by the following facts : Early in the case, Seymour felt a 
pricking in the right throat far back. At the fourteenth day a 
piece of bone, half an inch wide and very thin, escaped into the 
throat from the part mentioned, and was coughed out. Unfortu- 
nately it was not preserved. I suppose that this splinter was bro- 
ken off of the left jaw, and driven across the throat so as to wound 
the third branch of the fifth nerve. 

Seymour's recovery was rapid, although I used no treatment at 
all. October lOth. — The face has recovered sensation. Taste 
was restored to the tongue, although not perfectl}^ Tact and pain 
were still absent. October 20th. — There is some feeling in the 
tongue, but no motion on the left side, and no change in the 
nutrition. 

Returned to duty October 20th, 1864. 

Treatment. — Pain exists in almost every nerve wound, and is so 
Treatment terrible in some as to tax all our resources, and, too often, 
pain. to defy them all. 

The most frequent cases are those of partial nerve lesions. Here 
we have several points to determine before treating the disease. 
The scar should be inspected to see if it presses on any nerve. If it 
does, — and this is not often the case, — gradually increased pas- 
sive, and, at last, active motion, with frictions, and the use of an 
ointment of iod. plumb., will be of use. If the nerve track be 
tender on pressure, it should be freely leeched twice a week ; 
and, finally, after the tenderness has been lessened, it may be 
proper to blister the whole length of the nerve trunk repeatedly, 
and also to administer internally iodide of potassium. The free 
use of leeches gave us often most happy results. More severe 
measures, such as the actual cautery, impressed us unfavorably. 
I have used every form of electric agency to relieve these cases, 
but, neither in my private practice nor In the hospital were these 



CASE OF BURNmG PAIN. 447 

eans successful, except in mild cases, where as the general nu- 
trition of the limb improved the pains also lessened. 

While using the methods above described, it is necessary to have 

me means of temporarily quieting the patient, and easing his suf- 
ferings. For these purposes nothing is better than the hypoder- 
mic injections of morphia. I am now in the habit of using, in such 
cases, the fourth of a grain of sulphate of morphia, and the fiftieth 
of a grain of sulphate of atropia, or larger doses in like proportions. 
I think that this combination does not produce as much general 
disturbance as the morphia alone, while, as was elsewhere shown, 
the atropia does not lessen materially the pain-destroying powers 
of the former drug.^ I ought to add that, in some persons, even 
this dose of atropia is too much, and that, in certain patients, it 
always occasions headache. 

I have no confidence in atropia itself, nor in hyoscyamia, daturia, 
or conia as anaesthetic agents ; but I am satisfied that morphia, thus 
used, is invaluable, and that it not only relieves the pain, but in 
some way tends to give permanent aid. I should not think it worth 
while to urge this point if it were not that the profession is still too 
little in the habit of resorting to hypodermal injections. With us, 
in our hospital wards, they were employed with the utmost free- 
dom, so that, day after day, from forty to fifty injections were used. 
In very many cases we were thus enabled to soothe pain until more 
active agents, or the slower changes due to time, had brought about 
permanent ease. It would not be too much to say that many 
patients, whose tortures would otherwise have justified amputation, 
have found in hypodermal injections the power to bridge over, so 
to speak, the long intervals required to ameliorate their sufferings. 
As regards the point at which this remedy should be employed, I 
have little to say, except that in causalgia the patients insisted that 
it gave most relief when used at the spot of greatest suffering. 
In common aching or darting neuralgias, there seems to be no 
great choice, and it is only necessary to select a spot where the 
areolar tissue is loose and abundant. 

Burning Pain. — I beheve that I can do no better here than to 
transcribe our remarks upon the treatment of this singular affec- 
tion, giving the first formidable instance which fell under our care.

448 CASE OF BURNING PAIN. 

lief; Discharged. — A. D. Marks, sergeant, Company C, 3d Maryland 
Volunteers, aged 43, enlisted August, 1861. Previously healthy. May 
3d, 1863, at Chancellorsville, he received two wounds ; one in the neck 
and one in the chest. The first ball passed in below the anterior bound- 
ary of the left armpit, through the margin of the great pectoral muscle, 
the arm being raised at the moment. The missile glanced on the neck 
of the humerus and made its escape anterior to the coracoid process, 
apparently wounding the plexus. As he turned to leave the field, a 
second ball entered the right side of the back, to the right of the eighth 
dorsal vertebra, and, crossing behind the spine, entered the left chest. 
The first wound caused palsy of motion and feeling in the left arm. 
The second gave rise to cough, spitting of blood, dysphagia, etc. It 
finally caused pleurisy, and large escape of pus during breathing. The 
wound is now closed, July 4, 1863, but the lower half of the lung is 
consolidated. The second wound brought him to the ground. He was 
taken prisoner, exposed a good deal to weather, and finally exchanged, 
and sent to West Philadelphia, Satterlee General Hospital, June 10, 
1863. 

During the first week, the arm, though palsied, was painless. Then 
he began to feel a knife-like pain from the wound down the inside 
of the limb, and also on its front, and on the ulnar side, half way to the 
wrist. With these pains came a tingling and burning sensation, as when 
the blood returns into a limb said to have been asleep, but more severe. 
Soon afterward this extended to the hand also, and he began to be able 
to feel the touch of foreign bodies. 

Present State, July 5, 1863. — He lies on his back, anxious-looking, 
and pain-worn. The left arm rests on a pillow. It is cold, mottled, and 
swollen. The skin of the hand is thin, and dark-red, but presents no 
eruption. Tactility, nowhere absent, is dull on the dorsum of the hand 
and fingers. Except in these parts, localizing sensation is good. The 
whole arm and hand, except its back part, is, as he says, alive with burn- 
ing pain, which warmth and dependence of the limb increase, and which 
cold and wetting ease considerably. It is subject to daily exacerbations 
about midday. 

Motion. — The shoulder muscles act well. The deltoid is feeble. 
There is no motion below the elbow. The fingers are half flexed, and 
their joints swollen, sore, and congested. The deltoid is atrophied one 
half. The extensors in the fore-arm are flabby, but the general oedema 
prevents us from telling whether the fore-arm muscles are wasted or not. 
Pressure on the cicatrix gives no pain. 

While at Satterlee Hospital, Dr. Walter F. Atlee used ice to the arm, 
and on the shoulder a blister dressed with morphia. These measures 
relieved the arm for the time without aiding the hand. 

July 5. — Ordered hypodermic injections of the fourth of a grain of 
sulphate of morphia, near the scar, twice a day. This relieved the arm ; 




CASE OF BURNING PAIN. 449 

hand growing daily worse, so that even ice ceased to afford ease, and 
he constantly prayed us to amputate the arm. 

July 7. — Erysipelas set in about the seat of the injections, and they 
were discontinued for a time, morphia being used internally, and lead- 
water locally. 

On the 9th, the disease had left him, and two drops of conia were in- 
jected into the shoulder. This was thrice repeated, but gave no relief. 
Atropia, one twenty-fifth of a grain, was next essayed, three times suc- 
cessively, at intervals of two hours. It caused dilatation of the pupils, 
flushed face, giddiness, and dry tongue. The only valuable result was a 
relaxation of the flexors of the fingers, which had become contracted, 
but which never afterward became so rigid as they had been. The pa 
tient himself called attention to this singular effect. Again morphia, 
one third of a grain, was injected into the arm without aiding the hand. 

July Ih to July 20. — Injections of morphia were made into the hand 
twice a day. They gave so much ease that the ice was temporarily 
abandoned. 

July 21. — For the first time we were able to examine the limb with 
electricity. 

Tactile sensation was good in the arm and absent in the ulnar distri- 
bution. In all other parts of the hand tactile sensation existed. In the 
portions insensitive to touch, deep pressure and pinching caused pain, 
which was very severe, but was indistinctly localized by the patient. 

Electro-muscular contractility was absent in the whole hand and fore- 
arm. The currents caused everywhere great pain, so that we could not 
tell if it were muscular or not. Probably the muscles still had sensa- 
tion, since pressure on them was agonizing. Every electric examination 
necessitated the iumiediate subsequent use of morphia injections. 

August 14. — The recent warm weather has increased the pain, so 
that he moans and weeps incessantly. 

Up to September 9, various means were employed. The injections 
have been so numerous that the part is dotted with punctures, and their 
irritation has aggravated his sufferings to such a degree that they have 
been permanently laid aside for the internal use of narcotics. As local 
agents, we have had recourse to laudanum, lead-water, ice, oil, poultices 
with and without soda, and poultices of carbonate of soda, with vinegar 
to release carbonic acid. Of these, the soda poultice did best ; but iu 
this, as in every instance, the ease lasted but for a day or two. In de- 
spair, leeches were placed about the cicatrix, and blisters were applied 
over it and kept open, and also over the nerves which were tender on 
pressure ; neither aided him. 

Meanwhile the pain increased, but became limited to the palm and 

fingers and lower fore-arm, with darting pains up the arm. The tactility 

improved, and the muscular tenderness lessened. The general oedema 

disappeared, and the atrophy was seen to be extreme, while the finger

450 CASE OF BURNING PAIN". 

joints remained sore and swollen. Every motion or vibration caused 
pain. 

October 18. — A blister on the palm failed to draw, but a blister on 
the dorsum of the hand acted well, and gave very marked relief. It 
was followed up with ammonia blisters on the palm and arm. These 
were repeated with, finally, cantharidal blisters. And now for the first 
time the ease was complete. Incessant blisters gradually ameliorated 
the pain. They were continued every few days for two months, until 
every trace of burning left him. He was so sure of the relief from this 
application that he was unwilling to allow the hand to heal before using 
a new one. 

December 1. — Slight pneumonia of right lung. 

December 10. — Electricity ordered. Immediate return of pain. 
Ceased its use. 
. Up to January 6th, his arm and hand were shampooed daily, passive 
motion was employed, and he began to sit up, and move about. 

January 6, 1864. — Careful reexamination. Arm gaining flesh. Ci- 
catrix shrinking. Atrophy general ; worst in the extensor group, in 
the fore-arm. (See specimens, casts Nos. 18 and 19, Army Medical 
Museum.) Sensation good throughout, but not quite perfect. 

Voluntary Movements. — Shoulder abductions, one third ; other actions 
perfect. Elbow extension complete. Flexion, by biceps alone, two 
thirds. Supination effected only by biceps. Pronation one third. 
Wrist extension and flexion about one sixth of usual range. Passive 
extension to line of fore-arm, where the flexors, which are contracted, 
limit the motion. Thumb everted, and flattened like that of a monkey. 
Slight flexion and adduction. Muscles utterly wasted. The finger- 
joints are no longer swelled, but are excessively rigid, and have no 
movement. 

Electric Test. — Below the shoulder no muscle has any electric con- 
tractility, and the sensibility to induced currents is also diminished. 
Again the electricity brought on the burning and was abandoned. 

Ordered daily etherization, and the fingers to be then freely moved. 
Shampooing to be continued, and the douche twice a day, with occa- 
sional blisters. 

January 29, 1864. — Electricity no longer renews the burning, and is 
to be daily employed. The gain was now rapid. Flexor power over 
the fingers came back, but no extension, and no thumb motion. 

February 23. — Supination and pronation improving. Atrophy les- 
sening. Ordered a roll of bandage to be placed on the palm, the fingers 
to be bound down over it, to overcome the extensors, which, within a 
month, have been contracting. 

On April 10, 1864, he was discharged, free of pain, and having only 
three fourths flexion of the fingers, without power to extend them. All 
the other motions were improving, and the thumb-muscles began to re- 
• spond to the will. Sensation perfect. 



TREATMENT OF NUTRITIVE CHANGES. 451 

Besides the agents above mentioned, we employed in other cases 
local vapor baths, alternate douches of hot and cold water, lotions 
or ointments of iodine, iodide of lead, iodide of potassium, sulphur, 
tar, cyanide of potassium, glycerine, bandaging, and various posi- 
tions calculated to affect the local circulation ; one and all failed to 
answer our purpose, and, as I have already stated, blistering in 
some shape became, with morphia and local use of water, our most 
reliable method of treatment. 

TREATMENT OF NUTRITIVE CHANGES, AND OF THE PARALYSIS. 

The blister has often appeared to me to have acted favorably 
upon the nutrition of the skin, as well as on the pain ; 

... 1 • 1 • 1 Blisters. 

but, exceptmg this agent, nothmg else, save tune, seemed 
to improve the condition of the thin and red and shining cuticle. 
The loss of power in the muscles and the atrophy are both reached 
by the same therapeutic means. First, by active motion, ^^tj^g ^nd 
where it was at all possible, and by passive motion where C^'sham- 
this alone was available ; second, by shampooing the part, p'^^^^s- 
I was once of opinion that we could scarcely give a patient too 
nmch either of passive motion, or of kneading (shampooing) the 
muscles. I have since learned by larger experience that, when the 
nutrition of a part is inactive, the amount of stimulus applied to it 
must bear to this a certain relation. I prefer to have the limb well 
shampooed, twice a day, for not over ten minutes. In children 
who are partially palsied, I have several times seen injury produced 
by excessive shampooing, and in them, as well as in excitable and 
feeble adults, it sometimes causes nausea, which is just what is apt 
to follow the over-use of induction currents, as I have elsewhere 
stated. 

Hot and cold douches, used alternately, seemed to us of use in 
flushing the limb or part whose nutrition was impaired. Hot and 
In the U. S. Army Hospital for Nervous Diseases, etc., douches, 
we had in each ward pipes so arranged as to give a douche of fifteen 
feet fall ; but even the simple application of hot and cold water will 
often answer an excellent purpose. 

The last and, perhaps, the best of all the means of exciting the 
tissues, and increasing the flow of blood through the part, 

.,,.,.. P ,.,... ^ / Electricity. 

IS tlie judicious employment oi electricity m some form. 
In our volume upon " Injuries of Nerves," we discussed this portion 
of the treatment in a separate chapter, and drew conclusions which 
I have found little reason to modify. Since, however, the agent in 
question is of all means the most important in nerve wounds, I will

endeavor, in as brief space as possible, to indicate my views as to 
its employment. 

When an induced interrupted electric current of some power is 
made to pass through a muscle, contraction ensues and a deep pain 
is felt, referred to the belly of the mviscle. M. Duchenne (de 
Boulogne) terms the former electro-muscular contractility, the lat- 
ter electro-muscular sensibility. 

M. Duchenne has observed that, in certain cases, the will re- 
Eiectro-mus- gaius powcr ovcr a muscle which yet remains unsuscep- 

cularcon- -i i • i i • i p • i i t 

tractiiity. tiblc to motiou by the stunulus oi mduced currents. In 
common with my colleagues, I have often witnessed this condition 
of muscles. Indeed, I have now a patient whose biceps is fully 
under volitional command, but cannot be stirred by a strong induced 
current. In certain cases I have noticed that these very muscles 
would contract readily when sharply struck with the finger ends, 
so that it was not alone the will which could rouse them into ac- 
tion. Something akin to this is noticeable always in the anterior 
thigh muscles, which rarely respond at once to electrization, but, 
when aroused, are as sensitive as others. The same temporary 
inertness under strong induction currents is often met with in other 
muscles of the leg, and it is not uncommon to find a muscle very 
excitable to-day, and to-morrow far less so. It is also quite com- 
mon to notice that a muscle temporarily inactive under the currents 
may be aroused by the electrization of a neighboring muscle or 
group of muscles. The statements here made must be borne in 
mind during every electric examination, since otherwise a person 
unaccustomed to these strange variations in the responsive power 
of the muscles may readily be misled. As a rule, when examining 
muscles for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, it is best to compare 
the part with a symmetrically-placed portion of the body. 

Electro-muscular sensibility, like electro-muscular contractility, 
Eiectro-mus- is a somcwhat unfortunate term. A muscle has a certain 

cularsensi- . p , . . , , • i i 

biuty. sensibility to pamrul impressions, and, when excited by 

electro-magnetic currents, feels a pain which is merely indicative 
of the continued existence in the muscle of the special susceptibihty 
in question. 

This power of the muscle to feel pain when galvanized has, 
however, certain relations to the functional life of the muscle, 
which make it important in the prognosis of nerve wounds. In 
most cases of intelligent adults, it is easy to ascertain if it be pres- 
ent or not in any given group of muscles ; but in very sensitive 
persons, in hysterical women, in children, or in those of small in- 



ELECTRIZATION^ OF THE SKIN AI^D MUSCLES. 453 

diligence, I have often found it difficult to make them discriminate 
between the pain in the skin, occasioned by powerful currents, and 
that which belongs to the muscular tissues. 

Besides causing muscular contraction and muscular pain, elec- 
tricity occasions pain in the nerves of the skin, flushes the part 
more or less, and almost certainly stimulates all the organic proc- 
esses of the region. 

For these various purposes we commonly employed electro- 
magnetic interrupted currents. Most of the ordinary Theinter- 
~ ^ . , . . rupted cur- 

instruments will answer for curative uses ; but m certam rent. Eiec- 

rare cases, and for diagnosis and prognosis, nearly all of machine. 
them are too feeble. Duchenne's large battery is excellent, but 
altogether too costly. I prefer, on the whole, the rotating ma- 
chines made by NefF & Sons, Philadelphia. The electro-galvanic 
instruments, m.ore couA^enient on account of being automatic, are 
apt to get out of order from corrosion of the connecting wires, 
although, if Bunsen's cells be employed with bisulphate of mer- 
cury, this difficulty is much lessened. The neatest and most port- 
able are made by Chester of New York. The same maker, under 
the direction of Dr. Hammond, has constructed a very portable 
galvanic battery of copper wire gauze and perforated zinc, which 
is put in action by vinegar, and is powerfiil enough for all ordi- 
nary uses where this peculiar agent is required. 

Direct galvanism should be used with care about the face, as it 
is said to possess the power to excite the retina most Direct gai- 
remarkabfy, and even dangerously. I have found it capa- '^'^"*^™- 
ble of flushino; and heatino; the skin far better than induced cur- 
rents, and I suspect that, in some cases, its ability to awaken the 
nutrition of the muscles is superior to any such result which can 
be attained through the means of electro-magnetism alone. 

To electrize or galvanize the skin, it should be dried and 
sprinkled with flour. The conductors employed by M. Electrization 
Duchenne are bundles of thin wires, with which the skin °^ *^^ ^^''^• 
is to be swept rapidly. A flat brass plate, roughened by cross- 
flling, answers very well. We need only to have in some way 
numerous points of contact. This application is very severe. It 
is a local excitant of the most intensely painful nature, but still 
liavhig the advantage of causing no lesion. In cases of anaesthesia 
it is invaluable, and it has also its uses as a violent counter-irritant, 
which may be used in many neuralgic affections. 

Electrization of the muscles may be effected directly or through 
the nerves. The former mode is preferable ; but in some cases 



454 MODE OF EMPLOYING ELECTRICITY. 

of causalgia of the palm, I have found it less painful to faradize the 
Electrization hand muscles through their nerve than by acting upon 
muscles. them more immediately. Direct faradization is made by 
applying conductors armed with wet buckskin, cloth, or sponge, 
over the bellies of the muscles. In this manner but little pain is 
occasioned ; and, if the operator be a good anatomist, he may 
readily pick out, so to speak, almost any single muscle, and call it 
into isolated action. 

It will be proper at this point briefly to consider the mode of

to diagnosis mjurics, and, lastly, m their treatment, 
sis. After a nerve has been injured, the skin, in its range 

of distribution, has its sensibility more or less impaired. The 
muscles undergo, in various degrees of completeness, paralysis as 
to volition, loss of tone, loss of excitability by electricity, and loss 
of sensibility to the pain occasioned by electricity. Of course, if 
the nerves have been cut across, the palsy is total ; the anaesthesia 
absolute. If, however, the injuries be partial, or have been in 
part repaired, we desire to ascertain what muscles have suffered, 
and to what extent. To effect this, we faradize them in turn. 
Those muscles whi(!h respond at all to the current are likely to 
recover in time ; the better the response, the sooner the recovery. 
Those which have lost contractility alone run some chance of 
restoration ; and those in which both this property and sensibility 
have departed are, of all others, the least likely to get well. 

The limb should now be faradized daily for about fifteen min- 
Mode of em- utcs. At oiic time I sliarcd Duchenne's opinion, that it

tic agent. allowcd lor the nerves to undergo repair. I am now 
satisfied that it is wise to begin as soon as possible, and by this 
means, with passive motions, to keep up the nutrition of the part, 
as I am sure can in some degree be effected by steady use of these 
agencies. When the nerve connection becomes reconstructed, the 
muscles will then be in a far better state than they would have 
been were they to be left to themselves. Moreover, we should 
thus avoid much of the stiffening and shortening of muscles which 
disuse permits to occur. Under favorable circumstances, the 
electrized limb flushes and gets warm, the muscles grow, and the 
atrophy disappears. 

This involves a long and industrious treatment, most of which, 
however, may be confided to the well-instructed care of the 
patient, and his friends or attendants. In many cases, months, or

en a year or two, must pass before the fortunate period at which, 

e nerve being restored more or less, we may hope to observe 

tisfactory changes in the regions suppHed by it. In but too 

any instances we never arrive at this result. 

In these unhappy patients it is rarely the case that all the 

uscles are paralyzed. In some, one or more are lost to use ; and 

in others a single functional group is inactive. In many such in- 

tances good may be done by dividing the . tendons of muscles so 

ortened as to interfere with the motions of their antagonists ; 

d we have, finally, a means of relief in the employment of pro- 
thetic apparatus, designed to imitate, by elastic bands or springs, 
the movements of certain muscles. The character of these means, 
and the indications for their use, may safely be left to the judg- 
ment of individual practitioners. 

Anaesthesia is often treated with success by the electric brush, 
used in the manner which I have elsewhere pointed out. 

I have dwelt upon the employment of electricity, because I be- 
lieve it to be an invaluable mode of treatment. Further details 
may be found in connection with the cases which I have appended 
to this essay. 

The constitutional treatment of wounds of nerves is of the 
utmost importance. It has several times happened to constitu-

me to observe that success m the local means was de- mentor 
layed until the general system had been invigorated by neryes. 
the use of tonics and stimulants. 

Malaria and scorbutic disease were with us the principal ene- 
mies ; but, even in civil practice, I have found that much good 
could be done by attention to the constitutional conditions. 

The following cases illustrate most of the various complications 
which occur in nerve wounds, as well as the methods of mustrative 
treatment described in this paper. It would have been ''^^' 
easy to multiply them, but I have thought it enough to select a 
few typical cases. Two — those of Gervaise and Schiveley — are 
quoted from the work " On Nerve Wounds," etc., in order to ap- 
pend a statement of their present condition. 

Case I. Wound of Fore-arm ; Partial Loss of Sensation ; Immo- 
hility of Fingers and Wrist owing to Disease ayid Adhesions ; Recovery. 
— J. Albaugh, aged 19, 83d Pennsylvania Volunteers, Company G. 

May 5th, 1863, at Chancellorsville, while drawing ramrod, a ball 
passed through the interosseal space of the right fore-arm, on the inner 
face of arm, at junction of middle and lower thirds, emerging through 



466 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

posterior face two inches lower. Hand fell. Hemorrhage free. He 
walked to rear. Sent to Falmouth, and thence, May 9th, to Washington. 
"Wound healed in six weeks. Fingers contracted until relieved by pas- 
sive motion at Satterlee Hospital. Entered our wards June 23d, 1863. 
The wrist motions are limited, and the fingers lie in partial flexion, ow- 
ing to stiffness from neglect and disuse. The index and second fingers 
are insensible, especially so on their posterior aspects. As he cannot 
move the fingers at all, and has loss of tact from nerve wound, we can- 
not say how much of the defect of motion may be due to neural injury. 

Treatment. — Electro-magnetism, with dry conductors to insensitive 
parts. Passive motion and faradization of fore-arm. Douche and tinct- 
ure of iodine to joints. Frictions with iodine ointment over cicatrix. 

October 2Qth. — Gradual return of sensibility. Soreness lessened. 
Increasing ability to move wrist and fingers by will. Continue treatment. 

November 1st, 1863. — Movements and sensation nearly normal. 
Ordered to guard duty. 

Case II. Wound of Brachial Plexus : Paralysis, Atrophy, and Con- 
traction of numerous Muscles ; Burning Pain until Wound healed ; Mo- 
tions limited by General Stiffening of the Joints. — Christian Behr, aged 
twenty-six, turner, German, enlisted April, 1861, in Company K, 1st 
Minnesota Volunteers. Previous health good. At Gettysburg, July 
2d, while charging, a ball struck his left hand between the thumb and 
forefinger, and entered finally half an inch below clavicle, three and a 
quarter inches from its sternal end, to emerge through the scapula, 
three quarters of an inch below its spine, three and a half inches 
from vertebral centre. The ball traversed the lung. He fell, feeling 
pain only in the first wound. Loss of arm motions total. Is sure that 
he could feel the touch of the other hand when he sustained with it the 
wounded limb. He rose at once, and, constantly spitting blood, walked 
half a mile, and for twenty-four hours wandered about in search of aid. 
Sharp pain came on in front of the shoulder, within a minute or two 
after the wound, and before next day was felt in the hand as a burning 
pain, which remained unaltered until the wound healed. Motion im- 
proved up to fifth week. A splint was used during first two weeks. 

December 20th. — Admitted. Wounds healed. Palm red and slightly 
eczematous. Great wasting of teres major and minor. Deltoid slightly 
atrophied. 

Sensation. — Loss of tact on dorsum of thumb only. 

Motion. — The fingers were flexed spasmodically two weeks after 
wounding, and were straitened by a splint. They have remained straight 
and stiff! At date of wound, the pronators were in a state of spasm, 
which has now relaxed. Abducts arm 35° only, owing to stiffening of 
chest muscles. For the same reason, the backward motions of the arm 
are limited. Extension of arm feeble. Owing to stiff" joint, the arm

P 

Hpn be flexed from a state of full extension only two thirds of usual 
^Hhange, where also passive motion ends. Has voluntary pronation, but 
no voluntary supination. Voluntary extension of wrist lost. Wrist 
flexion good. 

Fingers stiff. No voluntary extension of first joints, slight of second 
and third, but limited by stiffening. Flexion of first joints good ; that 
of second and third limited by rigidity. 

Thumb, no extension ; flexion good. Electric test. Deltoid, no elec- 
tro-muscular contractility ; electro-muscular sensibility, fair. The pec- 
toralis major, supinator longus, infra and supra spinatus, and teres 
muscles, have no movement when faradized, but feel the current sen 
sibly, though not perfectly. Contractility lessened a little in biceps, 
triceps extensor; lessened also in extensor indicis, and extensor of 
thumb ; no loss in other extensors. Thumb muscles have no contractil- 
ity, except the abductor, and there is none in the little finger muscles, 
nor in the interosseal group. 

The chief final difficulty in this case arose from the remarkable stiff- 
ening in all of the joints, and from the atrophied and contracted state 
of so many muscles. The joints were again and again treated by break- 
ing up the adhesions, and using passive motion. This process always 
caused great suffering, swelling, and inflammation. Nor was it efficient. 
Next, we tried slow and gradual flexion, but this also became intolera- 
ble, even when accompanied by repeated subdermal injections of mor- 
phia. It is needless to detail the several means in turn resorted to. 
All of them failed, and the patient was at length discharged, but little 
better, March 25th, 1864. 

Case III. Gunshot Wound of Axillary Nerves ; Extensive Paralysis of 
Fore-arm and Hand ; Loss of Sensation ; Great Improvement under Treat- 
ment ; Continued Gain afterwards ; Final fJondition Three Years after 
Wound. — George T. Barnes, aged 25, sail-maker. Company D, 68th 
Pennsylvania Volunteers. Healthy until wounded at Gettysburg, 
July 2, 1863, while carrying an officer upon a stretcher. Ball entered 
at the antero-superior angle of the left axilla. Exit in arm one third 
of an inch below apex of posterior axillary fold. He felt stung, 
as he says, but did not fall until he fainted from loss of blood. Is 
sure all motion was lost, but cannot speak as to sensation. Was taken 
to the rear, and was insensible for some hours. On awakening he had 
intense, sharp, shooting pains, but no burning. About November Ist^ 
the pains lessened, and are now much better. Sensation was found to 
be absent in the front of the arm the day after he was wounded. It 
has changed very little. Motion has slowly improved. 

December ^th. — Admitted. Wounds healed. General health good. 

Nutrition. — Hand swollen, bluish, and red in spots ; always cold to 
touch. Palm dry ; never sweats except on thenar eminence, the limit 



458 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

marking the lines of separate nerve supply. No atrophy above elbow. 
Flexors and pronator radii teres much wasted. Elsewhere no atrophy. 
The ulnar side of the flexor group in fore-arm, as well as the biceps, is 
slightly contracted. 

Motion. — Voluntary movement good in arm and shoulder. Elbow a 
little stiffened ; has about two thirds range. Pronation and supination 
nearly absent. Wrist, no flexion. Extension good. Fingers and 
thumb, no flexion. Extends third and fourth fingers by extensor com- 
munis alone. The first and second have no extension. No lateral fin- 
ger motions. Slight power to extend thumb. 

Sensation. — Absent over lower half of fore-arm, anteriorly and in 
the palm up to the radial half of the thenar eminence. The thumb and 
back of arm and hand are normal. Touch is lost in the first and sec- 
ond fingers only in second and third phalanges. In the third in all the 
phalanges. In the fourth, in all three, and over metacarpal bone. 
Loss of sense of pain and temperature accompany loss of touch. 

Electric Test. — Electro-muscular contractility and sensibility les- 
sened in left biceps, triceps, and extensors. The electric properties are 
good in the supinator longus, but deficient in the extensor group, ex- 
cept the extensor indicis and extensor communis of third and fourth 
fingers, which react very well under faradization. Contractility les- 
sened somewhat in the extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor ossi meta- 
carpi pollicis. None in the other thumb extensors, pronator teres, 
short thumb muscles, and interossei. Good in pronator quadratus. 

Treatment. — Electricity, douches, active and passive motion. 

January 1st. — Improving. Acts as orderly. February 1 2th. • — Wrist 
motions much better. Fingers extend better, and are less sore and 
less stiff. Cannot flex or extend second and third phalanges more than 
when first seen. Can now supinate the arm well, and slightly pronate 
it Discharged, April, 1864. 

I saw this man again. May 16th, 1866. He is much better. The 
arm has grown considerably, as shown by comparison of measurements 
made December, 1863, and at this date, May, 1866. The hollow for- 
merly so marked in the fore-arm, owing to atrophy of the flexor group, 
is now much less marked. The palm is still thin and flat, wanting the 
natural arching from side to side. The thumb muscles also exhibit 
notable atrophy. 

He has regained all the natural movements, as flexion and extension 
of wrist, pronation, and supination. He has flexion and extension of 
the first phalanges of the fingers. The second and third phalanges are 
bent at right angles, and are nearly fixed in this position, presenting a 
good specimen of the claw hand. The interosseal group of muscles in 
the hand is paralyzed ; hence, loss of power to extend second and third 
phalanges. The common extensor acts on the first phalanges, and, 
being still active, confers its usual movement. The flexion of the second 



ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 459 

third joints depends on the common flexor. Its palsy originally 
destroyed this motion, and its subsequent contraction flexed these joints, 
their diseased condition fixing them firmly in the posture so acquired. 
But we know that the interossei in health flex the first phalanges. In 
the present case, these muscles are palsied, and still the flexion is well 
performed. A little care in examination showed that the contracted 
common flexor has still some power, or rather, has regained power. It 
cannot pull on the second and third phalanges, for these are already 
flexed, but it acts secondarily to draw the first phalanx toward the 
palm. He has good tactile power in the arm, and in most of the hand. 
In fact, everywhere he feels a touch, but always it is felt as a slight 
stinging sensation. When the finger ends are touched, the impression 
is referred to the centre of the palm. 

Case HI. Gunshot Injury of Musculo-spiral Nerve ; Loss of Sen- 
sation and Motion ; more Eapid Return of Sensation, with Persistence 
of Motor Palsy in all the Lower Muscles fed hy this Nerve ; Final Recov- 
ery of Motion ; Examination after Three Years. — Jeremiah Crowley, aged 
25, iron-moulder, Pennsylvania, Company G, 68th Pennsylvania Volun- 
teers, enlisted August, 1862. In good health, until wounded at Gettys- 
burg, July 2, 1863. A ball entered right arm, on outside, one and a 
quarter inches in front of a line drawn perpendicularly upwards from 
the external condyle, five inches above that point. Exit inside of arm, 
on a line drawn perpendicularly upwards from the internal condyle, 
three and five eighths inches above it. The ball broke the bone, passing 
behind the artery and nerves, probably damaging with bone-splinters the 
musculo-spiral nerve. He thought his arm was shot off", dropped his 
gun, but did not himself fall until hit three times elsewhere. Is sure 
that all motion and sensation were lost in the arm and hand. Limb 
dressed next day, on rectangular splint, with the fingers left free to 
move. On fourth day came pain in wound, which lessened until it 
ceased about October 20th, when the wounds healed. Some splinters 
escaped in the mean while. Sensation began to return at third week, 
and motion very slowly after two months. Not improving. 

Present State, January 10th, 1864. Nutrition. — Measurements: Bi- 
cipital, left, nine and three quarter inches ; right, eight and seven 
eighths. Fore-arm, left, ten and one eighth inches ; right, nine and 
five eighths. Arm slightly wasted throughout. Hand of normal color, 
a little swollen. The right hand sweats the most, and smells acid. 

Sensation. — No pain of any kind. Extensors of hand and supinator 
group a little sore on pressure. Localization perfect. Tact perfect, ex- 
cept a spot on back of thumb between the metacarpal bone and that of 
the forefinger. 

Voluntary Motion. — Partial paralysis of biceps, and complete of tri- 
ceps and supinator longus. No flexion of fore-arm can be made, and but

very feeble extension. These difficulties are increased by slight stiffen- 
ing of elbow-joint. Pronation good. Supination two thirds range and 
feeble. AVrist : Good flexion ; no extension. Thumb : Feeble flexion ; 
no extension. Has other motions. Fingers : Good abduction and ad- 
duction of first joints ; flexion and extension good, except that the lat- 
ter is absent in the first joints. 

Electric Tests. — Supinator longus : No contractility ; sensibility les- 
sened. Extensors, same condition. Biceps : Contractility feeble. 

Treatment. — Douches ; daily faradization and movements. Rapid 
February gain. The stiflhcss of the elbow has been overcome. Has 
18th, 1SG4. acquired voluntary flexion of two thirds range. Supination 
by biceps only. Pronation and supination nearly entire. Flexion good 
throughout. Measurements : Bicipital, left, eight and seven eighths 
inches ; right, ten. Fore-arm, left, nine and one eighth inches ; right, 
ten and a half. It thus appears that he has lost somewhat in general 
muscular size, but gained out of proportion in the wounded arm. Con- 
tinue treatment. 

May^ 1864. — Still better. Has regained full flexion of fore-arm, but 
has no extension of wrist. Acted as ward-master until discharged, 
April 10, 1865. 

April 23, 1866. — I reexamined Crowley. He has still loss of sensi- 
bility in a limited region of back of hand, between the metacarpus of 
thumb and first finger. Can now extend the fingers a little, and the 
wrist has one half range of motion. Violent voluntary efforts to 
straighten the fingers cause them to flex. No thumb extension. Slight 
contraction of flexor group in fore-arm. 

Remarks. — We are here struck with the rapid return of sensation, 
and with the comparatively slight sensory lesions, as compared to the 
defects of muscular function. 

Case IV. Gunshot Wound of Right Axillary Plexus ; Slight Final 
Loss of Sensation ; General Loss of Motion ; Nutrition hut little Affected ; 
No Contractions or Special Atrophy ; Muscles Firm. — S. M. Deal, aged 
22, New York, farmer. Enlisted August, 1862, Company G, 140th New 
York Volunteers. Wounded July 2d, 1863, at Gettysburg, kneeling, 
arm bent, gun in left hand. Entry one half inch below clavicle, three 
inches from sterno-clavicular articulation. Exit through and below 
scapular spine, two inches external to posterior edge of scapula. Sting- 
ing at wound. Lay down conscious, but weak ; fainted in half an hour. 
Carried away. Dressed at fourth day. No secondary hemorrhage. In 
an hour the stinging extended to the fingers, and has so continued, 
being more or less severe. 

March ^ih^ 1864. — States that the motions became worse about sec- 
ond week, and have improved but very slowly since. 

Admitted. Nutrition. — Measurements : Bicip-

il, right, nine and a half inches ; left, eleven. Fore-arm, right nine 
id a quarter inches ; left, eleven and a quarter. Some general thinning, 
mt no special loss. Muscles firm. No contractions. The passive mo- 
ion of elbow limited by stiffness to three fourths range. No swollen 
joints nor disease of nails. Hands look alike. Sensation not quite 
jrfect in cushions of finger ends, but nowhere absent ; it is good 
ibove elbow, and lessened on radial side of fore-arm. 
Motion. — The shoulder is moved only by the trapezius, all the other 
mscles being paralyzed. The elbow is moveless also, and the prona- 
)rs and supinators are without power to stir. The wrist flexion is pre- 
irved as well as the extension. The interosseal group moves partially 
md with feebleness, but the fourth finger is paralyzed, and the third is 
reak. There is slight power in the common extensor of the fingers. 

Electric Conditions. — Contractility of trapezius the same as on left 
ide. None in deltoid. In pectoralis-major, one third. In biceps and 
iceps extensor, none. A trace in extensor of fingers. Extensor pol- 
picis, one fourth. Flexor group, none. Pronators, none. Interossei, the 
Lrst is the best, decreases toward ulnar side. 
Treatment. — Passive motion ; daily faradization. 
April \st. — There has been no gain. The track of the nerves has 
icome painful, and there are shooting pains in the hand. For these 
linear cautery was thrice used over the nerves involved, and iodide of 
[potassium given. These means produced no satisfactory change, and at 
[this period our patient was discharged under a general order. 

This case presents no interest as regards treatment. Its negative 
{points are valuable. It was curious to see such complete palsy with so 
little atrophy, and with so slight an affection of sensation, as well as with 
|so remarkable an absence of pain. 

Case V. Gunshot Wound of Axillary Nerves ; Total Loss of Motion ; 
Extensive Atrophy; Gradual Gain; Partial Loss of Sensation ; Slight 
Causalgia and Neuralgia ; Relief of both ; Tremors ; Great General 
Gain. — R. C. Phillips, aged 20, farmer. New York. Enlisted August, 
1862, in Company C, 4th New York Volunteers. Healthy until wounded, 
July 2d, 1863. He was slightly injured by a ball v/hich cut the skin over 
the sternum. A little later, a ball entered the left chest, over the sec- 
ond rib, three fourths of an inch to left of middle line, and lodged in 
the left arm, on a level with the posterior border of the armpit, two 
inches external to it. It was cut out a few hours later. Its track was 
downward and outward in front of the chest, but finally behind the hu- 
merus, damaging the axillary nerves, but not the artery. When hit he 
was lying down, loading, but cannot say in what position his arms might 
have been. He felt weak at once. Did not lose consciousness. Thought 
his arm was off. Total loss of arm motions. As to feeling, cannot say, 
but had sharp pain very soon in the thumb, and in the first and second 



462 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

fingers. Wound dressed that night, and again in three days. No splint 
used. then, or later. Motion improved gradually. The pains became 
worse. Sensation was finally found to be diminished in the radial dis- 
tribution. 

Decemher 9th, 1863. — Wounds healed about four weeks ago. Lefl 
hand cold and blue. Radial palm looks as though frosted. The follow- 
ing muscles are atrophied to a greater or less extent : Infra spinatus has 
lost about one third its size. Deltoid, loss one half; biceps two thirds ; 
teres muscles, three quarters or more. Fore-arm generally wasted ; 
flexor group most so. The interossei are much atrophied. Contracted 
muscles : Biceps slightly, no others. 

Measurements. — Left acromio-deltoid, fifteen and a quarter inches ; 
right acromio-deltoid, seventeen inches. Bicipital, lefl, eight and three 
quarter inches ; right, ten. Fore-arm, three inches below olecranon 
process, left, nine and a quarter inches ; right, ten and a quarter. 

Voluntary Motion of shoulder imperfect. Triceps acts well. Biceps, 
no power. The supinator longus alone produces flexion. Pronation 
and supination feeble and slow, but complete. Wrist has two thirds 
flexion and the like extension. Thumb muscles act well, except short 
flexor. Fingers : First has flexion of first phalanx, and imperfect of 
second and third. Extension good, except in second and third phalanges, 
which have this movement incompletely. Second finger, all movements 
much better. Third and fourth have all motions perfect. No abduc- 
tion or adduction of first finger. No abduction of second. 

Ahnormal Movements. — Incessant quivering of the deltoid during 
rest, ceasing when the arm is abducted so as to relax this muscle. 

Sensation. — Touch is felt throughout, but is badly felt on the left 
half of radial side of fore-arm, thumb, first finger, and radial side of 
second finger, where also there seems to be more analgesia than else- 
where. 

Pain. — Some little burning in anterior parts of thumb, first fin- 
ger, and radial side of second. None in the arm. The darting pains 
have long been absent, but reappear if the arm be kept too warm. 
Pressure over the median nerve causes pain in the parts above named 
as having diminution of tactile sensation. No muscular hyperaesthesia. 
Treatment of pain by four blisters. Entire relief by February 19th, 
1864. Faradized daily from date of admission. Great gain in motion. 
Tremor has disappeared. 

February 29th. — Movements all rapidly improving ; more complete 
and stronger. Promoted to lieutenancy. 

The two cases wliich follow are extracted from tbe book on gun- 
shot wounds of nerves so often referred to, and are given in order 
to complete these histories up to a more recent date. For these 
additions I am indebted to my friend and former colleague, Dr. 
William W. Keen: —

Case YI. Gunshot Wound of Axillary Nerves ; Paralysis of Motion ; 

f Slight of Sensation ; Burning on Tenth Day ; Great Atrophy and Con- 

racted Muscles ; Subluxation of Fingers ; Nutritive Changes ; Eczema in 

oth Palms ; Great Improvement ; Discharged. — David Schiveley, aged 
17 no trade, Pennsylvania, enlisted August, 1862, in Company E, 114th 

Pennsylvania Volunteers. Healthy before and after enlisting, except a 
llight attack of typhoid fever. 

At Gettysburg, July 2d, 1863, while aiming, a ball entered one inch to 

le left of the middle line, and one inch above the sternal end of the 
jlavicle. Exit on the posterior part of the right arm, at the middle 
(ine, two inches below the axilla. The ball passed in front of the tra- 

lea, broke the inner half of the right clavicle, went in front of the 
vessels of the neck and the subclavian artery, in front of the axillary 
'artery, and below the humerus — speaking of that bone as raised and 
abducted at the time. When hit, he thought his arm was shot off. It 
dropped, the gun fell, and, screaming that he was murdered, he stag- 
gered, bleeding freely, and soon fell unconscious. When a little later 
he revived and raised his head, a second ball struck him in the right 
temporal fossa and emerged through the right eye. He jumped up, 
ran a little way, and fell once more. When hit, he lost all motion in 
the limb, which became numbed, but felt no pain. Two weeks later, 
feeble power to move returned gradually in the elbow, shoulder, and 
arm ; and, after two months, in the wrist and hand. 

Treatment, cold-water dressings and means to relieve burning, but all 
ineffectual. 

The joints became swollen early, and the arm bent at a right angle. 
The hand, dependent, lay across his chest during a long period. He 
made some attempts at passive motion as he found the hand becoming 
stiff, but no great good was thus gained ; and, as the contractions took 
place and the joints grew worse, the wrist became moulded to the 
curve of the chest on which it lay. 

About the tenth day, burning pain began in the palm and fingers, 
especially in the cushions of the fingers and the knuckles. It was at 
its worst a month later, and remained thus another month, after which 
it grew less. When at its height, he suffered from loud sounds, vibra- 
tions, and dry contact. The rubbing of his boots on the floor was the 
greatest annoyance, and this he relieved by wetting his stockings. Since 
October, four months after he was wounded, it has been unaltered. 
Sensation, little affected at the outset, has undergone no change of mo- 
ment. Voluntary motion, which grew better for a while, suffered anew 
and increasingly, as the nutritive changes developed themselves. When 
they first arose, we have been unable to determine. 

Present State, Dece?nber 17th, 1863. — Nutrition. — The wounded arm 
is shrunken generally, with well-marked atrophy of the supra and infra 
spinatus, deltoid, and biceps, the loss in the last two being fully one half. 



464 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

Triceps, no wasting of moment. Supinator longus and radial extensors, 
two thirds loss. Flexors and extensors in fore-arm, one half loss. 
Thumb muscles almost absent. Little finger and interosseal group, 
no loss. 

Contractions. — The flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus, and flexor 
carpi radialis being strongly contracted, the wrist is bent at a right 
angle to the arm and drawn to the ulnar side ; the extensor group is in 
like manner contracted, and the first phalanges, having thus been vio- 
lently extended while the wrist was flexed, have undergone subluxation. 

The color of the back of the arm and hand is natural as far as the 
knuckles. Thence to the finger tips the skin is tense, shining, hairless, 
mottled red and blue, abraded in spots ; the nails curved, and the joints 
swollen, and very tender. Palmar surface normal to wrist. The whole 
palmar face of the hand and fingers is polished, deep scarlet, abraded in 
points, and eczematous all over to a remarkable degree. The eruption 
followed the burning in about six weeks. The palm of the left hand is 
nearly equally eczematous. If his account may be trusted, it began to be 
so nearly a month before any eczema appeared in the wounded member. 

There is slight soreness on pressure in the infra spinatus, biceps, and 
flexors of the fingers. 

Voluntary Motion. — Entire in the shoulder, though weak. The elbow 
possesses the middle third of its normal range of motion, but cannot 
be fully flexed or extended. The wrist, lying at a right angle to the 
arm, has only about forty-five degrees of extension. The thumb, nearly 
fixed in adduction, has slight and very feeble motion in all its joints. 
The fingers, bent back in extension, can be flexed to make a straight 
line with the dorsum of the hand. The flexors move the second and 
third phalanges through one fourth of their usual range. They perform 
abduction and adduction well. 

Sensihility. — Tactility nearly normal. Localization of touch not 
quite perfect on the radial distribution in the hand. 

Pain. — The burning in the right hand is intense and constant. It 
is made worse by heat, exposure, drying of the skin, and dependent 
positions. He has kept it wet and wrapped up since October, 1863, 
which we believed might have made the skin troubles worse, until we 
saw this and other cases improve under treatment without any cessa- 
tion in the application of the water. 

The left hand, which, it will be remembered, was also eczematous, is 
painful on pressure or touch, especially in the palm. He is positive 
that there is pain in that hand, and that it is a burning pain. Both 
hands are kept covered with loose cotton gloves, which he wets at brief 
intervals. He is especially fearful of having the right hand touched, and 
is nervous and hysterical to such a degree that his relatives suppose him 
to be partially insane. It is difficult even to examine him properly on 
account of his timidity, and his whole appearance exhibits the eflfects 



ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 465 

pain, want of rest, and defective haeniatosis. His treatment was 
)nstitutional and local. It answered admirably so far as gain in health 
loss of pain were concerned. The after-means employed to cure 
le deformities and restore motion were partially successful. 

Heniarks. — The electric tests satisfied us that in time the mus- 
could be restored, and assured us that the nerve communica- 

)ns were entire. The sensibility was practically perfect. Motion, 
feliough feeble from atrophy in some parts, was present in every 
group of muscles. It was limited hy the contracted muscles and hy 
the nutritive lesions in the joints. These two combined have dam- 
aged the power of movement, and left worse effects than usually 
result from partial paralysis affecting directly the motor nerves. 
Had proper passive motion been early used, there can be little 
doubt that the hand would now be far better than it is. Specimen 
No. 15, in the Army Medical Museum, is a cast of the limb. 

January 2Dth, 1867. — Health and strength very good ; is attending 
school. Eyesight in right eye lost, of course ; the lids are now constantly 
in contact, and do not look so unseemly as before ; they can be some- 
what separated, showing the shrunken ball, the sclerotic only being 
visible. 

Motion. — Perfect as to range in shoulder and elbow ; would be per- 
fect in wrist, but is limited to three eighths range by contraction of flex- 
ors. Power is somewhat diminished. Thumb perfect, but lies adducted. 
He can abduct it well. It is also everted so as to form the " monkey 
hand." 

The first phalanges are constantly at an angle of 45° in extension. 
They can be extended to 90° voluntarily, and flexed to a line with dor- 
sum of hand. The second phalanges have about the middle third of 
their range of motion, but not much force. The third phalanges can- 
not be moved voluntarily, but can be moved passively well. The joints 
appear to be normal, save the subluxation of the knuckles. Abduction 
and adduction good. 

Sensation. — Good. 

Contractions. — The flexors are contracted so as to limit extension of 
wrist ; the extensors are not, I think, contracted, but by the constant 
flexion of the wrist at 90° they extend the fingers as above. 

Pain. — In August, 1864, he began to lose the violent pain. It was 
not gradual, but one day he noticed suddenly that his glove was dry, 
and yet he could use his hand well and without pain. It was not entirely 
gone, and he yet wet his hand for some months, but it grew much bet- 
ter. Even now he feels dry rubbing in the palm of the hand to the 
finger tips, and a loud noise, such as a wagon making a great noise in 
passing, or a sudden emotion, as seeing a person fall, etc., makes the 
same impression.

466 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

In the left hand there is no pain. It left about the same time. 

Appearance of Hands. — Left hand perfectly normal. The eczema 
he is pretty sure passed away before he ceased wetting the hand. 

Right hand, color normal ; no eczema. It continued longer than on 
the left hand, but also disappeared before he ceased wetting it. It 
sweats a great deal ; gets cold very easily ; has no constant pain in it. 
The hair has been reproduced on the dorsum, even to that of the fin- 
gers. Nails normal ; second and third phalanges a good deal wasted ; 
muscles of thumb a good deal wasted (say two thirds), except flexor 
brevis, which is of nearly normal size. Hypothenar muscles of about 
normal size. 

Nutrition, — Right biceps, eight and five eighths inches ; left, nine 
and one eighth. Right fore-arm, three inches below olecranon, eight 
and five eighths inches ; left, nine and one quarter. 

His nervousness is entirely gone, and he is perfectly well mentally. 

Electro-Muscular SensiUlity is greater in right than in left arm 
throughout. 

Electro- Muscular Contractility very markedly diminished in right arm 
from shoulder down to hand. It is not more than one half 

He can use his hand so as to handle a fork. Could use a knife, but 
was always left-handed ; holds a book well, e. g., " Gray's Anatomy ; " 
cannot write with it ; can touch every finger tip with thumb. 

The temperature taken April 20th, 1867, was as follows : —

thermometer bulb could be held and covered equally well by either 
hand, — Right, paralyzed side, 97|° Fahr. ; Left, paralyzed side, 97^°

Case VII. Gunshot Wound of Left Arm, Ulnar, and Median Nerves ; 
Paralysis of Motion ; Slight of Sensation ; Contraction of Flexors ; Re- 
laxation under Treatment ; Atrophy ; Claw-hand from Paralysis of In- 
terossei ; Stinging Pain in Hand ; Great Gain ; Interosseal Paralysis 
alone remains ; Discharge with Prothetic Apparatus. — Henry Gervaise, 
aged 20, Canadian, blacksmith, enlisted February, 1862, in Company F, 
1st Vermont Cavalry. Healthy, until shot, July 7th, 1863, in the left arm. 
Probably the wound of entry was the one over the artery, at the edge 
of the biceps, six inches above the internal condyle of the humerus. Exit 
on postero-internal fiice of arm, half an inch above, and three and a quar- 
ter inches behind the other wound. He felt pain in the arm, but dis- 
mounted, the artery jetting blood. After walking a little way, he fainted, 
and, awakening after some hours, found that the bleeding had ceased, 
but that he had no motion from the shoulder to the finger tips, and that 
sensation was lessened below the elbow. The pain in the hand grew 
worse gradually, and was neuralgic in character. On the second day, 
he could move the elbow, and during the first week could stir the 



ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 467 

umb. About December, 1863, he began to move the fingers volun- 
tarily, and this control has continued to improve. 

In January, 1864, electricity was used in the hospital where he then 
was, but he says it was applied only on the fingers. 

Present State, Fehruary 18, 1864. — Hand congested; palm purplish; 

ils curved. Measurements : Biceps, right, eleven and three eighths 
inches ; left, ten and one eighth. Fore-arm, right, eleven and one half 
inches ; left, ten. 

Flexors in fore-arm wasted considerably. Thumb muscles wasted, 
and all the interbssei much atrophied. No stiffness in the joints. The 
short flexor of the thumb, and the flexor group in the fore-arm, are 
moderately contracted. The former defect has allowed the extensors of 
the thumb to act on it so as to bring its metacarpal bone level with those 
of the fingers, and to turn the nail upward. 

Sensation. — Anaesthesia and analgesia in palm and palmar face of 
all the fingers ; but only in the dorsum of the hand, and not on the dor 
sal aspect of the fingers. 

Motion. — Good above elbow. Supination and pronation normal. 
The wrist flexion is incomplete from want of power. Extension limited 
by flexor contraction. 

Thumb. — Flexion partly lost from want of power, and extension lim- 
ited by contraction of short flexor. He has no abduction nor adduction 
of the fingers, and cannot flex the first phalanges, or extend the last 
two. Hence there is paralysis of the interosseal group. 

It is not necessary to speak in detail as to the electric properties, 
which were wholly absent in the interosseal muscles, and defective in 
some others. 

Treatment. — Electricity, douches ; splint to correct flexions. Under 
this treatment, with energetic use of passive motion, the flexions were 
corrected, and every motion regained, except that of the interosseal 
muscles. To have a prothetic apparatus, and be discharged. 

April 9, 1864. — The hand is now healthy in color, the neuralgia 
nearly entirely well. 

April 22, 1867. Visible Condition of Hands. — Nails of left hand 
slightly incurvated ; palm slightly mottled, almost normal. 

Measurements. — Biceps, right, ten and three eighths inches ; left, ten 
and one eighth. Fore-arm, right, ten and five eighths ; left, ten and a 
quarter. The loss in the right arm is probably due to a change in his 
occupation, he being now a stationer. The left arm has gained rela- 
tively. 

Nutrition. — Flexors of left fore-arm, thumb muscles, and interossei, 
all slightly wasted. Flexors of fingers the only contracted muscles. 
Thumb has very nearly regained its normal position. 

Sensation perfectly normal on dorsum of hand, perfectly localized but 
a little dulled on palm ; dulled and imperfectly localized on palmar sur- 
face of fingers, but only slightly so. 



468 ILLUSTRATIVE CASES. 

Motion. — Flexion and extension of wrist perfect when the fingers 
are flexed, as they always are except when passively extended. AVhen 
so extended, extension is limited by the contracted finger flexors. Pro- 
nation and supination perfect. Abduction of thumb lost ; flexion weak ; 
extension good. No abduction or adduction of fingers ; no extension of 
last two phalanges, save by violent extension of the first phalanx ; but 
there is some flexion of the first, so that with great effort by flexing the 
first and extending the last two phalanges, he can grasp an object placed 
at the middle of the palm. It is doubtful whether this flexion is not 
wholly a secondary effect of the flexion of the last two phalanges rolled 
into the palm. The claw-hand is only manifest on extension of the fin- 
gers, the first phalanges being extended, the last two flexed one half. 

Electrical Test. — Electro-muscular sensibility in left arm and fore- 
arm the same as in the right ; in the hand diminished nearly one half. 
Electro-muscular contractility not now absent in a single muscle. In 
the left arm and fore-arm it is very slightly if at all diminished. In the 
left hand all the muscles respond, the general loss being about one half, 
but in the first and fourth dorsal interosseal about three quarters or 
more.^ 

Ordered galvanism daily to the hand. Temperature (the thermome- 
ter being placed in the metacarpo-phalangeal fold where both hands 
could close on it about equally well), after being tested for half an hour 
in each hand, was right, 95^°, left, 96° Fahr. 

I have alluded in the text to the fact that the temperature in 
parts partially paralyzed by wounds was in some cases higher than 
upon the healthy side. This was especially noticeable in the in- 
stances of causalgia described by my colleagues and myself. As 
the facts here referred to have excited some little doubt, I have 
appended to the cases of Schiveley and Gervaise the record of their 
present thermal state. To my surprise I found that despite the 
great changes made by time, the temperature of the injured hand 
is still slightly higher in both cases than that of the other member. 
Schiveley liad severe burning pain. Gervaise suffered only from 
neuralgia of the ordinary type. 

1 By the battery he is enabled to make a good fist, being able to bring the thumb into 
opposition to the fingers perfectly.

BY 



JOSEPH JOKES, M. D., 

lOFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY IN THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE, TENN., AND FORMERLY SURGEON IN THE 
PROVISIONAL AKMY OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES. 



The third and concluding Section of this volume is devoted to a Report by Professor 
Joseph Jones, M. D., of investigations relating to the diseases, mortality, etc., at the mili- 
tary prison in Andersonville, Ga. These investigations, undertaken at the instance of 
Professor Jones, were prosecuted under the authority of the Surgeon-General of the Con- 
federate Array. As an OiRcial Report, by a Confederate medical officer, this Section will 
have interest for all classes of readers. For the medical reader it will be valuable as a 
record of facts showing the relations between the prevailing diseases and the mortality at 
the Andersonville prison, and the morbific influences to which the prisoners were exposed. 
Moreover, the Report embraces elaborate investigations relating to the diseases which pre- 
vailed among the Confederate troops during the war. 

A due regard to the size of this volume rendered necessary some abridgment of Pro- 
fessor Jones's Report. Two of the chapters of the Report have been omitted. The subject 
of one of the omitted chapters is Hospital Gangrene. This subject will be treated of fully 
in the surgical volume to be published by the Sanitaiy Commission. The other omitted 
chapter gives an account oi post-mortem examinations in cases of diarrhoea, dysentery, 
scurvy, and hospital gangrene. Exclusive of these chapters, all the portions of the Report 
which are omitted are referred to in notes, either on the pages where the omissions occur, or 
at the end of the chapter. The omitted portions consist mainly of tables which may be 
spared without detriment to the Report, and extracts from various medical writers. In mak- 
ing the necessary abridgment nothing has been excluded of importance asaflfecting either 
the investigations or the conclusions deduced therefrom by Professor Jones. The greater 
part of the Report is retained, and is printed from the Author's manuscript without altera- 
tion, and with no additions except the marginal notes. 



PREFACE. 



The facts recorded in the following pages are of such a nature 
l;hat justice to my distressed and afflicted countrymen, as well as to 
myself, demands a correct history of these investigations upon the 
diseases of the Federal prisoners confined at Andersonville, Ga. 

Hearing of the unusual mortality amongst the Federal prisoners 
confined at Andersonville, I expressed, during an official Proposal of 
visit to Richmond, Va., in the month of August, 1864, engage in 
to the Surgeon-General, S. P. Moore, C. S. A., a desire tigations. 
to visit Camp Sumpter, with the design of instituting a series of 
inquiries upon the nature and causes of the prevailing diseases. 
Small-pox had appeared amongst the prisoners, and I believed that 
this would prove an admirable field for the establishment of its 
characteristic lesions. The condition of Peyer's glands in this dis- 
ease was considered as worthy of minute investigation. 

It was believed that a large body of men from the northern por- 
tion of the United States, suddenly transported to a warm south- 
ern climate, and confined upon a small portion of land, would fur- 
nish an excellent field for the investigation of the relations of 
typhus, typhoid, and malarial fevers. 

The Surgeon-General furnished me with the following letter to 
the surgeon in charge of the Confederate States military prison 
hospital at Andersonville : —

Surgeon Isaiah H. White, 

IN CHARGE OF HOSPITAL FOR FEDERAL PRISONERS, ANDERSONVILLE, Ga. : — 

Sir, — The field for pathological investigations afforded by the large 
collection of Federal prisoners in Georgia is of great ex- Letter of 
tent and importance, and it is believed that results of value %l^^^' 
to the profession may be obtained by a careful investigation of *^'*°'*- 
the effects of disease upon this large body of men subjected to a decided 
change of climate, and to the circumstances peculiar to prison life.

gether with his assistants, will afford every facility to Surgeon Joseph 
Jones in the prosecution of the labors ordered by the Surgeon-General. 

Efficient assistance must be rendered Surgeon Jones by the medical 
officers, not only in his examinations into the causes and symptoms of 
the various diseases, but especially in the arduous labors of fost-mortem 
examinations. 

The medical officers will assist in the performance of 'such post-mor- 
tems as Surgeon Jones may indicate, in order that this great field for 
pathological investigation may be explored for the benefit of the medi- 
cal department of the Confederate army. 

S. P. MOORE, Surgeon- General, C S. A. 

As soon as the necessary preparations ^ could be made, I repaired 
Circum- to Andersonville, and examined carefully the condition 
der^whi^h^ and discases of the sick and wounded Federal prisoners 
gationrwere in the Confederate States military prison hospital, and in- 
upon. stituted a series of post-mortem examinations, with the 

design of elucidating the pathology of the prevailing diseases. The 
weather was intensely hot, and the small structure surrounded at 
the sides with old tent cloth, and covered with boards, erected ex- 
temporaneously for the occasion, by the surgeon in charge, in the 
open space just outside of the limits of the hospital, afforded but 
indifferent facilities for the pursuit of pathological studies. In this 
confined, unventilated room, exposed to the burning autumnal 
sun, post-mortem examinations of the thoroughly poisoned and rap- 
idly decomposing bodies of those who had died from hospital gan- 
grene, diarrhoea, dysentery, and scurvy, were not unattended with 
discomfort, and with even some danger ; and I felt unwilling to do 
more than to invite the cooperation of the surgeons and assistant- 
surgeons. Consequently I did not feel disposed to criticize harshly 
the apparent indisposition on the part of the medical officers to en- 
gage in such unpleasant, and, to a certain extent, hazardous labors.^ 

1 During the recefit disastrous civil war, I was compelled to prepare the test fluids, and 
even certain of the mineral acids, for the analysis of the animal fluids. At the time of my 
last visit to the Confederate capital (August, 1864), I had just completed a long series of 
investigations upon typhoid and malarial fevers, and it was necessary to replenish my ex- 
hausted stock of test-fluids and re-agents before commencing the labors at Andersonville, 
and in the general hospitals attached to the army of Tennessee. 

2 At the time of the prosecution of these investigations, my own system was somewhat 
scorbutic, as manifested by the spongy and bleeding gums consequent upon the prolonged 
use of salt meat, with but scant supplies of vegetables. The Confederate currency had de- 
preciated to such an extent, that officers were not much better off than the privates of the 
Confederate army, and were in most cases confined to the ordinary ration of corn-meal and 
salt pork or bacon, with occasional small issues of fresh beef, rice, pease, and molasses; and 
the tendency of this diet without change was to induce a scorbutic state of the system. 

It might possibly be of some interest to those who may in future attempt similar investi- 
gations to know the precautions which I adopted to protect myself against poisoning in such

conimunica- l^bors conducted in accordance with the orders of the Sur-

had been forwarded to the Surgeon- General, I repaired to Camp Sump- 
ter, Andersonville, Georgia, and instituted a series of investigations 
upon the diseases of the Federal prisoners. 

The field was of great extent and of extraordinary interest. There

Sumpter. ^^f ^-j^jg prison, ou the 24th of February, 1864, to the present 
time, over ten thousand Federal prisoners have died : that is, near one 
third of the entire number have perished in less than seven months. I 
instituted careful investigations into the condition of the sick and well, 
and performed numerous post-mortem examinations, and executed draw- 
ings of the diseased structures. The medical topography of Anderson- 
ville and the surrounding country was examined, and the waters of the 
streams, springs, and wells around and within the stockade and hospital 
carefully analyzed. 

Diarrhoea, dysentery, scurvy, and hospital gangrene were the diseases 
The diseases which havc bccn the main causes of the extraordinary mor- 

causmg the ... 

extraordi- tality. The Origin and characters of the hospital gangrene 
ity which prevailed to so remarkable a degree, and with such 

fatal effects, amongst the Federal prisoners, engaged my most serious 
and earnest consideration. More than thirti/ thousand men crowded 
upon twenty-seven acres of land, with little or no shelter from the in- 
tense heat of a southern summer, or from the rain and dew ; with coarse 
corn bread, from which the husk had not been removed; with scant 
supplies of fresh meat and vegetables ; with little or no attention to 
hygiene ; with festering masses of filth at the very doors of their rude 
dens and huts ; with the greater portion of the banks of the stream 
flowing through the stockade a filthy quagmire of human excrements 
alive with working maggots, generated by their own filthy exhalations 
and excretions an atmosphere that so deteriorated and contaminated 
their solids and fluids that the slightest scratch of the surface, even the 
bites of small insects, were frequently followed by such rapid and ex- 
tensive gangrene, as to destroy extremities, and even life itself. A large

kumber of operations have been performed in tne hospital on account 
)f gangrene following slight injuries and mere abrasions of the surface. 
[n almost every case of amputation for gangrene, the disease returned, 
ind a large proportion of the cases have terminated fatally. I recorded 
jareful observations upon the origin and progress of these cases of 
mgrene, and examined the bodies after death, and noted the patholog- 
ical changes of the organs and tissues. All these observations, to- 
gether with the drawings, will be forwarded to the Surgeon- General at 
the earliest practicable moment. 
After concluding my labors amongst the Federal prisoners, I moved 
Macon, and instituted a series of inquiries and investiga- inyestiga- 
bions upon the hospital gangrene which has prevailed to horpitar'^ 
so great an extent in the army of Tennessee, during the f,je^^^*^o° 
Erecent disastrous campaign, and especially since the evacua- I'eimessee. 
tion of Atlanta. The doubtful, if not dangerous and disastrous, policy 
of collecting the cases of hospital gangrene into one hospital devoted 
exclusively to its treatment, was inaugurated amongst the general hos- 
pitals of the army of Tennessee, and about three hundred cases of 
hospital gangrene were collected at the Empire Hospital at Vineville, 
near Macon. I am at the present time engaged in investigating the 
disease in all its various stages at this Gangrene Hospital, and have 
made numerous analyses of the blood and excretions, and executed life- 
size drawings of the gangrenous parts, illustrating not only the appear- 
ance of the wound at different stages of the disease, but also the per- 
manent disability which gangrene produces by the contraction of the 
injured nmscles. I am also, at the same time, investigating the origin 
and causes of this disease in the army of Tennessee, examining the 
hospital records, as well as all cases of interest, and addressing numer- 
ous inquiries to the various medical officers. As soon as my labors 
with the Macon hospitals are completed, I will institute similar investi- 
gations in the Confederate hospitals of Columbus, Georgia. These 
active labors in the field will engage my attention for at least one or 
two months longer ; and, immediately after their completion, n)y full 
report upon hospital gangrene will be prepared, embodying the results 
of my investigations upon this disease in various parts of the Confed- 
eracy, in the general hospitals in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, 
and embracing also the more recent investigations at Andersonville, 
Macon, Vineville, and Columbus, Georgia. If I am favored, I hope to 
be able to place this report in the hands of the Surgeon-General about 
the 1st of May or June, 1865. 

Very respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 

JOSEPH JONES, 

Surgeon, P. A. C 8. 



476 PREFACE. 

On the 28tli of September, General Hood advanced upon the 
Advance of ^^^^ ^^ Atlanta and of the Federal army, and was so far 
Hwd^n successful, that thirty miles of the railroad supplying 
Atlanta. General Sherman's army, between Marietta and Tunnel 
Hill, were destroyed, and the garrison at Dalton captured. These 
movements necessitated new plans and combinations on the part of 
the commander of the Federal forces in Georgia. After sending 
a portion of his army to confront General Hood in Tennessee, 
General Sherman burnt Atlanta, abandoned his lines of communi- 
cation with the North, and, on the 14th of November, commenced 
his march for the coast of Georgia. To resist the sudden invasion 
of this powerful army of seventy thousand veteran troops, which 
marched at the rate of from ten to fifteen miles a day, the State 
of Georgia had less than four thousand militia, and the old men 
over fifty, and the boys under sixteen years of age. In the march 
through the heart of Georgia, from Atlanta to Savannah, the 
United States forces occupied a belt of country from thirty to 
sixty miles in width, and destroyed the entire railroad system of 
the State, burning rolling stock, depots, and bridges, and tearing up 
the rails for scores of miles on the Western, Atlantic, Georgia, 
Central, and Gulf Railroads. The line of march was marked by 
burning barns, cotton-gins and presses ; the destruction of agricul- 
tural implements and of numerous dwellings ; the loss of horses, 
mules, cows, hogs, and stock of all kinds ; and by the utter impov- 
erishment of the inhabitants.^ 

The active labors amongst the sick and wounded of the army of 
Return of Tenncssce did not cease until the middle of November, 
Augusta. and I returned to Augusta from Columbus on the 15th, 

1 Major-General W. T. Sherman, in his Official Report of the Georgia Campaign, gives 
the following estimate of his operations : — 

" I was thereby left with a well-appointed army to sever the enemy's remaining railroad communi- 
cations eastward and westward, for over one hundred miles, namely, the Georgia State Railroad, which 
is broken up from Fairburn Station to Madison and the Oconee ; and the Central Railroad, from Gor- 
don clear to Savannah, with numerous breaks on the latter road from Gordon to Eatonton, and from 
Millen to Aug-usta ; and the Savannah and Gulf Railroad. 

" We have also consumed the corn and fodder in the region of country thirty miles on either side 
of a line from Atlanta to Savannah, as also the sweet potatoes, cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry; and 
have carried away more than ten thousand horses and mules, as well as a countless number of their 
slaves. I estimate the damage done the State of Georgia and its military resources at one hundred 
millions of dollars, at least twenty millions of which has enured to our advantage, and the remainder is 
simple waste and destruction. This may seem a hard species of warfare ; but it brings the sad realities 
of war home to those who have directly or indirectly been instrumental in involving us in its attendant 
calamities." 

In complimenting the conduct of the rank and file, General Sherman says, in the same 
Report: — 

"A little loose in foraging, they ' did some things thej' ought not to have done ' ; yet on the whole 
they have supplied the wants of the army, with as little violence as could be expected, and as little 
loss as I calculated."

thus escaping either capture or isolation in a distant part of the 
State. The elaboration of the results of the investigations into a 
report to the Surgeon-General of the Confederate army, was im- 
mediately commenced, and steadily continued throughout the win- 
ter; and, by the close of February, the work was so far com- 
pleted, that the greater portion was placed in the hands of my 
clerks to copy. Obtaining " leave of absence," I went on horse- 
back to Liberty County, on the sea-coast of Georgia, with the de- 
sign of transferring to a place of safety, secure from the constant 
depredations of the forces in and around Savannah, and tlie liber- 
ated blacks, my mother and sister, with her little ojies. Upon my 
return to Augusta, after a journey of over five hundred miles on 
horseback, in the early part of April, 1865, arrangements were 
being made to carry my report in person, on horseback, to Rich- 
mond — all railroad communication having been broken up by the 
desolating march of General Sherman's army through the Caro- 
linas. 

The surrender by General Joseph E. Johnston to General 
Sherman, on the 26th of April, 1865, of all the Confed- 
erate forces east of the Chattahoochee River, necessarily 
terminated these labors. 

After the disastrous close of a struggle which had en- 
listed all my sympathies and engaged all my energies, broken in 
health, fortune, an^ spirits, I desired only peace and rest ; and, 
filing away the investigations amongst the Confederate sick and 
wounded, turned my attention wholly to the pressing necessities of 
the times. 

I desired especially that the report on the Federal prisoners at 
Anderson ville should never see the hght of day, because The desire 
it was prepared solely for the eye of the Surgeon-Gen- not to pub- 
eral of the Confederate States Army ; and the frank report on the 
manner in which all the subjects had been discussed, prisoners at 
would only engender angry feehngs, and place weapons viue. 
in the hands of the victors ; and also because one of the chief 
reasons which stimulated the preparation of this report was no 
longer active, namely, the rectification of such abuses in the con- 
duct of military prison hospitals as would deprive the United 
States Government of all excuse in continuing retaliatory measures 
upon the gallant soldiers of the Confederacy, who have been or 
who might be so unfortunate as to become prisoners of war. By 
a deliberate and well calculated policy, thousands of the Southern 
troops were confined for months and even years in Northern

prisons, without any possibility of exchange ; and I felt it to be 
the duty of all their fellow-soldiers and countrymen to avoid all 
unnecessary abuses in military prisons, and to advocate that line 
of policy in the treatment of prisoners of war which would tend to 
insure the most humane treatment of Confederate prisoners during 
their distressing and painful captivity. 

Without any warning, I was suddenly summoned to Washing- 
The writer ^ou by the United States authorities, and ordered to 
the^uSted deHver up " all papers, reports, records, etc., of every 
to^rities^to ^^nd in my possession, pertaining to the Andersonville

The following letter was addressed to the Judge Advocate im- 
mediately upon my arrival in Washington : —

Immediately upon the receipt of this order, I reported to General

steedman. 710716 of the Original records of Andersonville, but only the 
materials of a report (including copies of some of the records of the 
Confederate States Military Prison Hospital) which I had prepared, in 
compliance with the orders of the Surgeon-General, C. S. Army, but 
which had never been presented, on account of the destruction of all 
railroad communication with Richmond, Virginia, before the completion 
of the report. I asked for information whether this order related to 
matter which had never been formally and officially presented to the 
Medical Department of the Confederate States. General Steedman 
informed me that the order was absolute, admitting of but one con- 
struction, and related to all matter in my posses.sion connected with the 
Andersonville Prison, and that my report, although incomplete and 
never officially presented or recognized, was nevertheless included, and

Medical directors of the field and hospital, and chief surgeons of corps, 
divisions, districts, and brigades, and surgeons and assistant-surgeons of regi-

S. P. MOORE, 
Surgeon-General, C. S. Army. 

After the completion, about the end of September, 1864, of these 
labors at Andersonville, I instituted a series of researches Account of 
upon hospital gangrene, pyaemia, and small-pox, which were de^sonTiiit"^' 
prevailing extensively amongst the sick and wounded of the ®*''- 
Confederate troops of the army of Tennessee, then under the command 
of General Hood. My active labors in the field did not cease until the 
middle of November, when I returned to Augusta, and commenced the 
elaboration of the results of my investigations into a report to the Sur- 
geon-General. Before the completion of this report, all communication 
by railroad was cut off by the armies of Generals Sherman and Grant, 
between Augusta and Richmond, the seat of the Confederate govern- 
ment. 

It was my design to make a similar inspection of all the Confederate 
military prisons, and to draw up an extended report upon the causes of 
disease and death, together with observations upon the best methods 
of remedying existing evils. 



480 PREFACE. 

In justice to myself, as well as to those most nearly connected with 
The matter this investigation, I would respectfully call the attention of 
lis^ed^p^re- Col. Chipman, Judge Advocate, U. S. Army, to the fact, that 
SuSon- *^* ^^^ matter which I now place in his hands, in obedience to

humanity, and to advance the interests of the medical profession. 

This being granted, I feel assured that the Judge Advocate will ap-

ina° case"!" The samc principle which led me to endeavor to deal hu- 
manely and justly by these suffering prisoners, and to make a truthful 
representation of their condition to the Medical Department of the 
Confederate army, now actuates me in recording my belief that, as far 
as my knowledge extends, there was no deliberate or willful design on 
the part of the chief executive, Jefferson Davis, and the highest author- 
ities of the Confederate government, to injure the health and destroy 
the lives of these Federal prisoners. 

On the 21st of May, 1861, it was enacted by the congress of the 
Bill enacted Confederate States of America : " That all prisoners of war 
fedemtf °'^' takcii, whether on land or at sea, during the pending hostili- 
congress. j^j^g ^j^j^ ^^ United States, shall be transferred by the cap- 
tors, from time to time, and as often as convenient, to the Department 
of War ; and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War, with the ap- 
proval of the President, to issue such instructions to the Quartermaster- 
General, and his subordinates, as shall provide for the safe custody and 
sustenance of prisoners of war ; and the rations furnished prisoners of 
war shall be the same, in quantity and quality, as those furnished to 
enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy." By Act of February 
17th, 1864, the Quartermaster- General was relieved of this duty, and the 
Commissary-General of Subsistence was ordered to provide for the 
sustenance of prisoners of war. 

According to General Orders, No. 159, Adjutant and Inspector-Gen- 
eral's Office, C. S. A., — " Hospitals for prisoners of war are placed on 
the same footing as other Confederate States hospitals, in all respects 
and will be managed accordingly." 

The Federal prisoners were removed to Southwestern Georgia in the 
The objects carly part of 1864, not only to secure a place of confinement 
the^Tedlraf niorc rcmotc than Richmond and other large towns, from the 
sJuthwe^s? operations of the United States forces, hut also to secure a more 
em Georgia, abundant and easy supply of food. 

As far as my experience extends, no prisoner who had been reared 
upon wheat bread, and who was held in captivity for any length of time,

could retain his health and escape either scurvy or diarrhoea, if confined 

to the Confederate ration issued to the soldiers in the field, The Confed- 
erate ration 
of unbolted corn meal and bacon. The large armies of the insufficient 

Confederacy suffered more than once from scurvy ; and, as against 
the war progressed, secondary hemorrhage and hospital gan- diaSoea. 
grene increased to a great extent, from the deteriorated condition of 
the blood, dependent upon the prolonged use of salt meat ; and but for 
the extra supplies received from home and from the various benevolent 
State institutions, scurvy, diarrhoea, and dysentery would have com- 
mitted still greater ravages. 

It was believed by the citizens of the Southern States, that the Con- 
federate authorities earnestly desired to effect a continuous Belief lu the 
and speedy exchange of prisoners of war in their hands, on stetesThat 
the ground that the retention of these soldiers in captivity v/as eratJaS^"^*^'

all its borders, with its starving women and children and old men fleeing

and over-burdened railroad lines, and adding to the distress and con- 
suming the poor charities of those in the interior who were harassed 
by the loss of sons and brothers and husbands, and by the fearful vis- 
ions of starvation and undefined misery, could be fully realized, much 
of the suffering of the Federal prisoners would be attributed to causes 
connected with the distressed condition of the Southern States.

482 PREFACE. 

In the trial of the Commandant of the Interior of the Confed- 
iQ the trial ©rate States MiHtary Prison of Andersonville, by the 
the poSions United States MiHtary Court in the Capitol at Washing- 
writer'sre- ^^n, Only thoso portions of my report were used in the 
to'thrS''^ prosecution by the Judge Advocate, which related to the 
sufferings of disoases and suflPerings of the Federal prisoners. In the 
prfsonera^^ cxtracts read before the court whilst I occupied the wit- 
aioneused. ^^^^ stand, cvcry thing relating to the distressed condition 
of the Southern States, and to the difficulties under which the 
medical officers labored in the discharge of their duties, as well as 
the inspection reports appended, were suppressed. 

When upon the witness stand, after hearing the extracts read 
statement from my rcport, I was compelled, by a sense of justice to 
onthewk-^^ my suffering fellow-countrymen, to state that I had ap- 
neas stand, peared before that military tribunal, in obedience to the 
demands of a power from which there was no appeal, and that my 
report contained other matter relating to the straitened condition 
of the Confederate government, as well as Inspection Reports, 
which demonstrated clearly that the medical officers in charge of 
the sick and wounded Federal prisoners, had made efforts to alle- 
viate their sufferings. 

These reasons have led me to desire to place all the facts before 
the public, who have already had access to certain selected facts.

MEDIATE VICINITY.

Before entering into an examination of the diseases which 
proved so fatal to the Federal prisoners in Camp Sumpter, the 
medical topography and climate of the surrounding country will 
be briefly considered, that data may thus be obtained by which to 
estimate more correctly the causes of the fatal diseases. 

ELEVATION. 

Andersonville, with the surrounding hills, including the Confed- 
erate States MiHtary Prison, is elevated from three hun- Elevation of 
dred and fifty to four hundred and thirty-five feet above viUe. 
the level of the ocean, and is situated in Sumpter County, Ga., be- 
tween the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers, seven miles due west of 
the former, and forty-two miles east of the latter, in about 32° 10' 
N. lat., and 85° 26' W. long., near the commencement of the west- 
ern slope of the dividing ridge between the streams flowing south- 
westerly into the Gulf of Mexico, and those flowing southeasterly 
into the Atlantic Ocean. 

Fort Valley, twenty-nine miles N. E. of Andersonville, at an 
elevation of about five hundred and thirty feet, lies upon Elevation of 
the crest of the ridge running between the Ocmulgee ^o'^^^a^^y. 
and FHnt rivers ; the former uniting with the Oconee, and forming 
the Altamaha, empties into the Atlantic Ocean, and the latter 
uniting with the Chattahoochee, and forming the Appalachicola 
River, pours its waters into the Gulf of Mexico. From this divid- 
ing ridge the country slopes toward the Atlantic on the southeast, 
and toward the Gulf of Mexico on the southwest. 

Andersonville is distant from the Atlantic Ocean in a straight 
line about one hundred and seventy miles, the configura- Distance of

tant fi'om the Gulf of Mexico, near where the Wakulla and St. 
Mark's rivers entered Ai^palachee Bay, one hundred and forty-two 
miles. 

The summit of the hill at Andersonville, upon which the Con- 
Situatiou of federate States General Hospital has been located, is four 
the hospital, j^^ndred and thirty-five feet above the level of the sea, 
and, according to the railroad survey, is next to the highest point 
on the railroad between Oglethorpe and Albany ; the highest point 
between these two places being about four hundred and eighty and 
six tenths feet. High table-land, with an average elevation of about 
four hundred and sixty feet, lies between Andersonville and Amer- 
icus, the highest point being four hundred and eighty and six 
tenths feet. The following are the elevations above the level of 
the sea of several points about Andersonville : Railroad depot, 
three hundred and ninety-nine feet ; hill opposite depot, four hun- 
dred and sixteen feet ; north branch of Sweet Water Creek at An- 
dersonville, three hundred and sixty feet ; south branch, three 
hundred and fifty and five tenths feet ; highest hill in stockade, 
about four hundred feet. The town of Americus is seventy- eight 
feet below the summit of the highest hill at Andersonville, and five 
and a half feet above the level of the south branch of Sweet 
Water Creek. 

The hills of this rolling country, in and around Andersonville, 
Surrounding ^ary in height from forty to one hundred and eighty feet 
^^^^- above the level of the water courses. The summit of 

the hill upon which the Confederate State General Hospital is lo- 
cated, is elevated one hundred and eight feet above the branch of 
Sweet Water Creek which flows at its base ; and one hundred and 
seventy-eight feet above low-water in the Flint River opposite this 
place. 

CHARACTER OF THE SOIL. 

The surface soil is sandy, with but little vegetable mould. For 
agricultural purposes the soil may be characterized as

ligiit, sandy, and unproductive atter the first tew years 
of cultivation. Many of the hills which have been cleared and 
cultivated present a barren surface, with varying admixtures of 
white sand and red clay. Some of the hills appear to be composed 
in large measure of sand, and, upon the surface, present a white, 
sandy, loose soil, in which the pouched rat (^Pseudostoma bursarium, 
Say : Canada rat, Shaw ; M21S bursarius, Linn. ; 3fus saceatus, 
Mitchell ; Gieomys cinereus^ Mafinisque cricetus bursarius, Desm.)

mrrows to a considerable depth. This singular animal burrows 

dth gi'eat facility in the loose soil of the pine-barrens of the South- 

jrn States, and casts up mounds of loose earth which have no ex- 

tterior opening, and which have been aptly compared to heaps of 

Iry earth emptied from a flower-pot. These animals are said to 

Form an extensive net-work of subterranean passages a foot or two 

)eneath the surface ; and the presence of the small sandy mounds 

[which they cast up are indicative of a dry, healthy soil. Other 

lills present a red color, resembling the red-clay hills of Middle 

md Upper Georgia ; they contain, however, much less clay in their 

Structure, and are much less productive. The red color is due to 

the admixture with the sand and clay of the oxide of iron. 

The hills are composed of alternate layers of sand and pipe-clay, 
called most commonly soap-stone. Both the sand and composition 
clay present various shades of color, from pure white to °^ ^^^^- 
deep red and chocolate. 

Under the microscope the pure white sand is found to consist of 
numerous crystalline fragments, and crystals of transparent quartz. 
After microscopical examination I was unable to detect any sili- 
ceous casts of animalcules, or fragments of corals and vncro cop- 
shells, either in the white and variegated clays, or in the atforof™the 
layers of sand. This, however, must be taken only as ^°^^' 
negative evidence, for the amount of matter examined, even after a 
prolonged microscopical examination, is necessarily so small that the 
inability to detect organic remains in the small portion subjected to 
this minute scrutiny does not at all allow of the general assertion 
that tliese strata are devoid of all organic remains. 

GEOLOGICAL POSITION. 

I was unable to discover any fossils by which the geological po- 
sition of this immediate locality could with certainty be Eocene sub- 
determined. As far, however, as my knowledge of the Sfaryfor- 
country lying above and below extends, this region should "^^*^'^'^- 
be referred to the tertiary, or more exactly to the upper or buhr- 
stone strata of the eocene formation. 

It would appear that the force which elevated the Appalachian 
Mountains expended itself chiefly in this direction between the two 
systems of rivers, and toward the south and western portions of 
Georgia and Florida, and the soutlieastern parts of Alabama. 

The relative elevation and geological position of Anderson ville 
will be best comprehended by considering the preceding facts in 
connection with a general view of the topography and geological 
features of Georgia. 



486 GEOLOGICAL POSITION. 

The State of Georgia is situated between 30° 22' and 35° 
Topography of nortli latitude, and between 80° 48' and 85° 40' 
SfeSufJa WGst longitude. Upon a general view of the physical 
of Georgia, structure of Georgia, the observer is first struck by the 
natural division of the State into two portions, presenting marked 
physical, geological, botanical, zoological, and climatic differences. 
We shall for the present purpose only indicate in a general way 
these grand divisions. 

Looking inland from the Atlantic Ocean, a vast plain seems 
The Atlantic emerging from its waters, and gently rising like the 
iig'onT™ shelving bottom of the ocean which washes its low 
portion. sliorcs. At first, an almost undulating level, it is imper- 
ceptibly broken into hill and dale, and gradually attains a height 
of from three hundred to five hundred feet above the level of the 
sea, when it meets the primary and metamorphic rocks, at a line 
passing through Augusta, Macon, and Columbus, near the heads 
of navigation of the Savannah, Ogeechee, Oconee, Ocmulgee, and 
Chattahoochee. The length of this plain, fi'om north to south, 
varies from one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles, and its 
geological formations extend from the cretaceous to the most re- 
cent ; and it forms a large part of the great Atlantic slope extend- 
ing through South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, 
Delaware, and New Jersey. 

North of the line which we have indicated as the boundary

SlountaiM^ the primitive, metamorphic, and older fossiliferous rocks, 
Sher crossing the State from northeast to southwest, with a 
portion. width of ouc huudrcd and sixty miles at the northern limit, 
and one hundred at the southern. With an elevation of about five 
hundred feet upon its southern border, this belt soon swells into 
an elevated plateau near one thousand feet above the level of the 
sea, and gradually rising toward the west and north into moun- 
tains from one to three thousand feet higher. The Blue Ridge 
range of mountains passes near its western edge, and attaining a 
heio;ht of from twelve hundred to four thousand feet, forms the 
most elevated land of the State. From the level of the low At- 
lantic islands to the elevated plateau and mountains, there is an 
average elevation of from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred feet, 
which, at the lowest calculation, is equivalent to 3° of latitude ; 
and, if we add the difference of latitude, we have near 8°, equiva- 
lent to an equal number of degrees of temperature. 

Whilst the southern extremity of the low plain bordering on the 



1^

is a region of palms, with an almost tropical climate in summer, 
ted to the sugar-cane, orange, date, and lemon, the vegetable 
mountainous northern extremity rises into an elevation fa^Jhe two^ 
favorable to grain, apples, and the grasses. Between the p^^*^"^^- 

b-tropical climate of the sea-coast, and the cooler and more brac- 
ing climate of the mountains, vegetation has a wide range ; cotton, 
rice, tobacco, wheat, and corn, and numerous fruits, as the fig, 
pomegranate, water-melon, plum, peach, pear, grape, and apricot, 
may be added to those above enumerated. 

Whilst the variations in the distribution of the animals is not so 
evident, from their relative scarcity, it is none the less Animals in 
marked. Thus the Amphieoma means (Congo Snake), portions. 
the Siren tacertina, and the Emy8 senata and reticulata^ are con- 
fined almost entirely to the low, muddy, hot rice-fields and swamps 
of the southern coast ; and the Gopher (^Testudo polyphemus)^ and 
the pouched rat (^Pseudostoma hur sarins)^ to the loose, sandy, 
pine-barren regions lying above the rice lands. 

Georgia presents the following geological divisions : — 
1st. The primitive and metamorphic formations, embracing the 
extensive belt of country that lies between the eastern primitive 
base of the Blue Ridge, and the northwestern termina- ^ol-pm?" 
tions of the cretaceous and tertiary formations, embracing f^'^^^'^io^s. 
the counties of Rabun, Union, Lumpkin, Habersham, Franklin, 
Hart, Elbert, Madison, Hall, Forsyth, Gwinett, Jackson, Clarke, 
Oglethorpe, Wilkes, Lincoln, Columbia, Warren, Hancock, Talia- 
ferro, Greene, Putnam, Jasper, Morgan, Walton, Newton, De 
Kalb, Henry, Butts, Fayette, Fulton, Cobb, Campbell, Carroll, 
Coweta, Heard, Troup, Meriwether, Pike, Upson, Monroe, and 
portions of Gilmer, Cherokee, Cass, Paulding, Talbot, Bibb, Jones, 
Baldwin, Richmond, and Crawford. The rocks of this region of 
Georgia are chiefly sedimentary, non-fossiliferous ; as micaceous, 
feldspathic, and sienitic gneiss, hornblend schist, talcose slate, 
chloritic slate, elastic sandstone, and other rocks of closely related 
characters. In several localities, as De Kalb County, large masses 
of granite are found. Crystalline primitive marble exists to a lim- 
ited extent in several of the counties in this region, as in Hall and 
Habersham ; it does not exist, however, in sufficient abundance to 
exert any marked effects upon the waters of this region. The 
justly celebrated argillaceous soils of this zone, which have resulted 
from the decomposition of the granites and slates, are not only 
richly endowed with all the elements of fertility, and especially 
with that most valuable element, potash, which has such a control-

ling effect upon vegetation, and Avliich, in these soils, has been de- 
rived fi'om the decomposition of feldspathic rocks, but, under a 
proper system of culture, are capable of being maintained in their 
primitive state of fertility, and of yielding abundant harvests, which 
will correspond in luxuriance to the magnificent forests of black 
walnut, chestnut, hickory, elm, red cedar, short-leaf pine, black 
oak, red oak, and Spanish oak, which adorned this soil in its virgin 
fertility. With an elevation of four hundred feet upon the south- 
ern border, and of more than two thousand feet in the northern 
mountainous regions, it is well watered by numerous streams, which 
afford inexhaustible supplies of water, with the requisite falls and 
water-power for thousands of manufactories. The waters of no 
part of the world are more pure, or contain less mineral matter in 
solution, than those of the primitive regions of Georgia. A dis- 
tinction must be made between the mineral and the suspended 
matters of streams and rivers. Water may present a turbid, muddy 
appearance, from the presence of insoluble suspended matters, and 
yet be very pure. It is well known to every resident of Middle 
and Northern Georgia, that the streams and rivers, especially in 
wet seasons, present a turbid reddish and brownish yellow and red 
appearance. This is due to the presence in the waters of the in- 
soluble red clay, w^ashed down by the rains. 

It is to the purity of its waters, as well as to its elevation, and

gia, with the southern and northwestern regions of the State, not 
only establishes its preeminence in healthfulness over the cretaceous, 
tertiary, and older fossiliferous formations of Georgia, but also 
establishes the fact, that its inhabitants, both white and black, are 
as healthy and as long-lived as the most favored people in the 
world. 

2d. The transition or older fossihferous formations in the north- 
Tho 'ransi- wcstem portious of the State, embracing Cass, Murray,

formations. Pa^ldiug, Cobb, Chcrokec, and Gilmer counties. This 
elevated mountainous region affords, in many parts, a fertile soil 
and healthful climate. The Appalachian coal-field merely touches 
the extreme northwest comer of the State. 

3d. The eocene lime formation, lying to the south and southwest 
of the primitive and cretaceous formations, embracing portions of

ingt(3n, Laurens, Pulaski, Twiggs, Houston, Bibb, Macon, ^cene. ume 
Sumpter, Randolph, Lee, Baker, Decatur, Dooly, Irwin, f«™**ioii- 
Thomas, and Lowndes. The soil of this region contains less clay 
in its constitution than the soil of Middle and Northern Georgia, 
and in many parts rests upon the joint clay, which belongs to the 
upper strata or buhr-stone of the eocene . formation. The joint 
clay, and, in fact, large tracts of this country, are underlaid by the 
eocene lime formation, which may generally be reached at a depth 
varying from ten to sixty feet beneath the surface, and which in 
many places is exposed, where the joint clay has been washed off 
by the denudations of former deluges. In addition to the inex- 
haustible deposits of shell limestone and marl in this section of the 
second zone, there are beds of superior kaolin, capable of furnish- 
ing material of the finest quality for china ware ; and, also, inex- 
haustible quarries of buhr-stone, which, upon trial, has proved equal, 
in most respects, to the French bulir millstones. In this section 
are found what are commonly called boiling-springs. Boiling 
They are nothing more than streams of water issuing ^p""ss. 
out of the sides of hills composed of shell limestone. The vol- 
ume of these streams varies greatly ; in some instances it is suf- 
ficient to turn more than a dozen mills, within three hundred yards 
of the orifice of the subterranean streams. In some places, as 
near Tennille, on the Central Railroad, where the hills are com- 
posed almost entirely of this eocene shell limestone, the streams 
have cut tunnels through the hills. Usually, the basins of these 
limestone boiling springs are formed of white sand, and particles 
of shells and echinoderms. As the water boils up, these particles 
of sand and shell are continually thrown up, producing a boiling 
appearance. The waters of all these boiling springs in the eocene 
lime formation of Georgia, which I have examined, are perfectly 
transparent ; and, as the stranger approaches the stream, it is diffi- 
cult to persuade himself that there is any water in the basin before 
him. They resemble in transparency the celebrated springs of 
Florida. 

In the summer season, these waters are deliciously cool and in 
viting, but they are said to quench thirst imperfectly ; and. Effect of the

to be much more subject to climatic diseases and bowel affections, 
and to exhibit higher bills of mortality, especially amongst the 
young, than those upon which rain-water, or water which has sim- 
ply percolated through the joint clay, is used. An intelligent and 
extensive planter of Burke County informed me that, since the 
abandonment of his hmestone springs and wells, and the substitu- 
tion of rain-water, collected in cisterns, disease had diminished at 
least four fifths amongst his servants and in his family. 

The chemical constituents held in solution in the waters of the 
Chemical wclls iu the coceue formation of Georgia, vary with their 
of"he watera depth, and with the character of the strata from which 
theToJene ^hc watcrs arc collected. Thus, if the strata of joint clay 
formation, j^^ thick, and the well ends in this formation without pass- 
ing into the shell limestone below, the water will be comparatively 
pure. This results from the fact that the joint clay, although rest- 
ing upon the shell limestone, contains relatively but a very small 
proportion of carbonate of lime, and is composed almost entirely 
of insoluble silicates. The waters of wells sunk in the shell lime- 
stone, differ in no essential respect from the waters of the limestone 
springs, the proportion of carbonate of lime being about the same 
in both. 

The injurious effects of the waters of those wells which pene- 
injurious trate the shell limestone formation, may be illustrated by 
titers from ^ simplc Calculation. At least seventeen grains of carbo- 
Siton?^'^ nate of lime would be consumed by an adult laborer daily 
formation, (j^^jng the hot wcather of summer. This lime would 
meet with various acids, as acetic and hydrochloric acids, in the 
stomach, and be converted into acetates and chlorides, etc., which, 
independently of their diuretic and irritant action upon the animal 
economy, must to a certain extent derange the chemistry of diges- 
tion and nutrition, and by these effects lay the system open to dis- 
ease, and especially to hepatic and bowel affections. The character

of lakes. Will depend upon their ongm, and upon the composition 
of their shores and bottoms. If the waters of the lakes rise out 
of the shell limestone, the waters will be impregnated with carbo- 
nate of lime, as hi the case of the boiling springs. If the waters be 
derived from the sandy surface soil and the joint clay, and if, at 
the same time, the bottom and sides of the lake be formed of joint 
clay, or of any other clay or sand in which lime exists in no larger 
proportion than from one half to three per cent., then the waters 
will be pure and suitable for drinking (provided there be not too 



GEOLOGICAL POSITION. 491 

much vegetable matter), and the proportion of carbonate of lime 
held in solution will be very small. The chemical composition of 
the lake and pond water, derived fi*om the shell limestone forma- 
tion, does not differ from the composition of the waters of limestone 
springs and wells sunk in the limestone formation. Those streams 
which derive their waters chiefly from the shell limestone forma- 
tion, contain much carbonate of lime in their waters ; while those 
streams which are supplied with water from the sand and clays 
resting upon the shell limestone formation, are remarkably pure, 
and do not contain a much larger proportion of carbonate of lime 
tlian the streams of the primitive region. The rivers which flow 
through the eocene forniation do not contain as much character of 
carbonate of lime as we would suppose, for two reasons : ing through 
first, their waters are derived chiefly from the highlands formation. 
of the primitive belt ; and second, over large tracts of the eocene 
formation through which they flow, the joint clay varies in thick- 
ness from ten to sixty feet, and their waters are derived chiefly 
fi'om this strata, which, as we have demonstrated, contains little 
more carbonate of lime than the soils derived from the primitive 
and metamorphic rocks of Middle and Northeastern Georgia. 

We have dwelt thus at length upon the eocene formation of ■ 
Georgia, because Andersonville is situated in this region of coun- 
try, and quite near to the great lime and cotton belt of this State. 

4th. The cretaceous formation, lying between the primitive and 
the eocene, and embracing the counties of Marion, Mus- cretaceous 
cogee, and portions of Talbot, Harris, Stewart, and Ran- ^^^''^''>''- 
dolph. This formation, which comprises comparatively a small 
area of the w^estern portion of the State, and lying just below the 
falls of the Chattahoochee, is elevated from three hundred to six 
hundred feet above the level of the ocean. 

5th. That portion of the tertiary formation which extends from 
the south, southwestern, and w^estern boundaries of the Portion of 
eocene formation to the Savannah River and Atlantic formation. 
Ocean, embracing Effingham, Chatham, Bryan, Tatnall, Liberty, 
Mcintosh, Glynn, Appling, Montgomery, Telfair, Ware, Bullock, 
and portions of Scriven and Emanuel. 

The lower, and what may be called the sub-tropical zone, com- 
mences in a chain of islands, and rising by a very slow sub.tropicai 
acclivity from the Atlantic Ocean to an elevation of from ^'"'^^ 
ten to thirty feet, is bounded at the distance of about thirty miles 
from the Atlantic Ocean by another more elevated plain, differing 
in the structure of its soil, and in the character of its vegetation. 



492 GEOLOGICAL POSITION. 

In the first low plane, which may well be termed the sub-tropical 
zone, there are numerous swamps, clothed with a most luxuriant 
and imposing vegetation — the tall cypress, the splendid magnoHa 
grandiflora, the majestic Hve oak with its mossy boughs, the luxu- 
riant sweet gum and deep-green tupelo, and the impenetrable cane- 
brakes, indicate not only the fertility of the soil, but also the 
warmth and moisture of the climate. These swamps discharge 
their waters into short, deep, sluggish streams, and increasing in 
breadth from their junction with the rivers, and interlocking with 
each other, form a chain across Georgia and Carolina to the Neuse 
in North Carohna, and, southward again, along the Atlantic border 
into Florida. The soil of the river bottoms, swamps, and marshes 
consists of a rich deposit of vegetable matters, mixed with varying 
proportions of sand and clay, sometimes alternating with beds of marl 
and sand ; this clay deposit varies in depth from five to fifty feet, 
and contains buried deep beneath the sm-face supporting the present 
luxuriant growth, the stumps of pines, cedars, oaks, cypress, and 
other trees ; and in some localities, as upon Skiddaway Island, 
Hjoier's Bridge, near Savannah, and on the Brunswick Canal, be- 
tween the Altamaha and Turtle rivers, bones of the megatherium, 
a gigantic sloth, and of extinct varieties of the horse, and of other 
extinct animals similar to those found in the pampas of South 
America, an analogous formation along the borders of the Atlantic 
Ocean. The existence of these remains of ancient forests deeply 
buried beneath the present surface, together with the bones of 
these extinct animals, associated with sea-shells identical with those 
now inhabiting the Atlantic Ocean, prove conclusively that this 
portion of Georgia has not only been recently reclaimed from the 
sea, but has been subjected to successive elevations and depressions ; 
and there are facts to show that the sea- coast of Georgia and Caro- 
lina is now slowly settling. 

This rich soil, formed from the washings of Upper Georgia, 
brought down by numerous rivers and deposited in a shallow sea, 
with a level bottom, is not only characterized by the tropical aspect 
of the palmetto, Spanish bayonet, tall feathery cypress, and glorious 
magnolia, but to the agriculturalist it is especially characterized as 
the peculiar region for the successful cultivation of rice and long 
staple cotton.

commencement of these elevated lands, is not more than from ten 
to thirty feet, whilst the elevation of the sandy second plain varies 
from fifty to two hundred feet above tide-water. This elevated 
plain continues back from fifty to seventy miles, when it is in turn 
bounded by another escarpment or ancient sea-clifi", running nearly 
parallel with the lower sea-margin. Beyond this ancient sea-beach 
we have another extensive plain which gi'adually rises by a succes- 
sion of hills and elevations to the primitive region ; and this hilly 
portion embraces the region which we have previously described as 
the eocene lime formation of Georgia. The second great plain is 
covered chiefly by forests of the long-leaf pine (^Pinus austr alls'), 
and the surface soil is composed chiefly of sand, with little vegeta- 
ble matter, resting upon beds of clay, and these again ujDon sand. 
The depth of the upper layer of sand varies greatly ; it is deepest 
at the southern boundary of the plain. I have seen wells thirty to 
forty feet in depth which passed through nothing but sand. It is 
from this more elevated plain that the swamps chiefly deriA^e their 
waters. Water derived from this great natural filter is remarkably 
pure and free from saline ingredients. We have made numerous 
analyses of these waters, and of those of the swamps and rivers in 
the lower plain, which will be considered when we treat more spe- 
cially of typhoid and malarial fevers. This pine-barren region is 
noted for health, and forms the summer resort of the planters who 
live during the winter months in the lower and more unhealthy 
region.

about seventeen miles due east of the western boundary situation of

magnesia and iron. The well of water upon the summit of the 
hill upon which the Confederate General Hospital is situated is of 
remarkable purity ; and in fact it may be considered as equal to 
the purest well-water in the world. Its temperature is sufficiently 
cool in this hot climate during the summer and fall months to ren- 
der it refreshing. The waters of the branches of Sweet Water 
Creek, before entering the Stockade (Confederate States Military 
Prison) and the Federal Hospital, are equally pure, with the ex- 
ception of very minute traces of vegetable matters ; these, how- 
ever, do not exist in sufficient quantity to be of the slightest mo- 
ment in a medical point of view. The waters of these streams are 
not so pleasant for drinking as the well-water, because their tem- 
perature is several degrees higher, and is subject to considerable 
variations, according to the volume and rapidity of the current 
and the deo;ree of external heat. 

From this examination of the waters of Andersonville and the 
No lime ia viciuity, we are justified in the conclusion that little or 
Anderson- ^'^^ ^^^^ Bxists iu the soil. The chemical examination of 
^^^^^- the waters corresponds, therefore, with the results of the 

microscopical examination of the sands and clays composing the 
surface of the country. 

The waters of the streams, wells, and springs within the Stock- 
Remarkabie ^^^ (Confederate States Military Prison) and the Mili- 
watS'from ^ary Prison Hospital (Federal) were also subjected to 
S™and careful chemical examination, and were found in like 
in fef Stock- manner to be of remarkable purity. The waters of the 
Prison'^Hos- stream which enters the Stockade, as well as of the bold 
pitai. spring which mingles its waters with this stream, just 

after its entrance into the Stockade, and which are extensively 
used by the prisoners for drinking, washing, and cooking, are of 
great purity, containing only traces of the sulphates and chlorides, 
and of lime, magnesia, and iron. The bakery is situated near this 
stream, and one of the Confederate regiments is camped upon the 
hill above ; but these sources of contamination are too far distant 
to sensibly affect the constantly flowing waters. The only per- 
ceptible effect was a slight increase of the chlorides. 

The waters of the stream which enters the hospital inclosure, 
as well as of the deep well within the hospital grounds, were in 
like manner of remarkable purity, and contained only slight traces 
of the chlorides and sulphates, and the salts of lime, magnesia, 
and iron.

gamous plants. ^*°" 

As these waters, loaded with filth and human excrement, flow 
sluggishly through the swamp below, filled with trees and reeds 
coated with a filthy deposit, they emit an intolerable and most 
ickening stench. Standing as I did over these waters in the mid- 
le of a hot day in September, as they rolled sluggishly forth from 
he Stockade, after having received the filth and excrements of 
twenty thousand men, the stench was disgusting and overpower- 
ing ; and if it was surpassed in unpleasantness by any thing, it was 
only in the disgusting appearance of the filthy, almost stagnant, 
waters moving slowly between the stumps and roots and fallen 
trunks of trees and thick branches of reeds, with innumerable 
long-tailed, large, white maggots, swollen pease, and fermenting ex- 
crements, and fragments of bread and meat. 



VEGETATION.

of the soil. 

The low grounds and swamps bordering the streams in this 
immediate vicinity are of no great extent, and they do not mani-

The swamps in this immediate vicinity appear to rest upon sand, 
and to have no great depth of vegetable mould. 

From this examination, we conclude that there is no recog-

AndJrson- immediate neighborhood of the narrow swamps, and the

As far as I could ascertain from the physicians and from the 
citizens, the highlands of Sumpter County have proved very healthy 
to the inhabitants. Along the borders of the swamps, and espe- 
cially along the Flint River, chills and fevers are common. 

After careful examination, I was impressed with the belief that 
the highlands of Andersonville and of this region of country were 
as healthy as any region of the world, situated in the same lati- 
tude, and at the same elevation above the sea ; and that this local- 
ity, chosen by the Confederate States for the confinement of the 
Federal prisoners, was much more salubrious than most of the 
region of Georgia lying to the south and southeast.

pouched rat (^Pseudostoma hursarium) are found in considerable 
numbers in the dry and more sandy soils. As far as my informa- 
tion extends, these animals do not inhabit the primitive region of 
Middle Georgia. The falls in the rivers may be taken as the 
geographical limits of these most interesting and characteristic ani- 
mals. The birds appear to be scarce upon the highlands and 
sandy hills. They abound chiefly along the watercourses. The

entire year. The wild turkey (^lleleagris gallopavo) is now rare, al- 
though when the country was settled both this bird and the deer 
were abundant.

of certain species abound to a most unfortunate extent. Abundance 
In this sandy soil fleas find a most suitable and healthy °^ vermin,

swarm in untold myriads, and render life at night all but intoler- 
able by their everlasting buzzing and their troublesome bites.

hands were thoroughly peppered with the bites of these insects, 
and throughout my stay at Andersonville my face and hands ap- 
peared as if covered by an eruptive disease. Between the fleas 
and the mosquitoes at night, I enjoyed but little sleep during the 
entire period of my investigations. It was almost impossible to

sleep on account of the mosquitoes, except under tents. I ob- 
served that many of the prisoners and Confederate soldiers had 
been similarly treated by the mosquitoes. It is probable that the 
immense amount of filth generated by the prisoners may have had 
much to do with the development and multiplication of these in- 
sects, for they are said to have been almost unknown in this section 
of country, before the foundation of the prison. 

CLIMATE. 

Andersonville is situated in very nearly the same latitude with 
Latitude of the followiug placcs : Savannah, 32° 4' 53'' ; Beaufort, 
^Sr'"""" S. C, 32° 25' 57"; Charleston, 32° 46' 33"; Montgom- 
ery, Ala., 32° 22' ; Jackson, Miss., 32° 23' ; Point Toma, Cal., 32° 
40' 13" ; San Diego, 32° 41' 58" ; Tuscaloosa, 33° 12'. 

It is incorrect to attribute the formation of the Peninsula of Flor- 
incorrect to ida in any great degree to the action of the coral insect, 
formation of The slow architecture of these animals, as well as the sed- 
Fiorida to imcut coustautly deposited by the Gulf Stream, without 
insect. doubt tend to add continually to this low neck or penin- 

sula ; but the frame-work of Florida, if the expression may be em- 
ployed, was formed by the same force which upheaved the tertiary 
formation of Georgia from the bottom of the sea. Florida is nothing 
more than the prolongation of this plain ; and but for this elevat- 
ing force, throwing up a mass of earth directly across the channel 
of the Gulf Stream, there is no mode in which we can conceive 
the formation of the peninsula, by the slow deposition of the sedi- 
ment of the Gulf Stream, and the still slower action of the coral 
insects. In fact the action of the Gulf Stream would be, if the 
land had not thus been elevated, to wear away the coast of Florida 
and Georgia. 

A second fact is that Andersonville is one of the most elevated 
points in the tertiary formation of Georgia. 

Thirdly, the elevation of the tertiary region of Georgia is not 
so great as materially to affect the climate. 

Thus it would be fair to assume that all places in the same lati- 
tude in the tertiary slope of Georgia would possess the same 
climate. 

In the absence of direct observations, the mean temperature of 
Mean tem- Andcrsouville may be assumed, without any great devia- 
Anderson*"-^ tlou from thc truth, at about 65° for the spring ; 82° for 
Sthe^af ^ the summer ; 65° for the autumn ; 55° for the winter ; 
1'°^- and 65° for the year. 

The isothermal line of Andersonville for the spring passes 



CLIMATE. 499 

tlirongli or near Cliarleston, S. C. ; Columbus, Ga. ; Montgomery ; 
Vicksburg, Miss. ; Fort Scott, Texas ; and rises up along the 
Pacific coast nearly fo the thirty-fourth degree of latitude. For 
the summer it commences as low down as the Bahamas, near the 
twenty-fifth degree of north latitude, passing through Nassau, and 
ascending along the coast of Florida, through Fort Dallas, St. 
Augustine, and along the coasts of Georgia' and Carolina, through 
Savannah and Charleston, and then almost directly across the Con- 
tinent, through Columbus, Montgomery, Jackson, Vicksburg, Miss., 
and Austin and Fort Dawson, Texas, thus falling below the thir- 
tieth degree of north latitude in Texas. For the autumn it com- 
mences on the Atlantic coast as high up as the thirty-fifth degree 
of latitude, and passes through Beaufort and Wilmington, N. C. ; 
Columbus, Ga. ; Montgomery, Ala. ; Jackson, Miss. ; and in Texas 
falls below the thirtieth degree of latitude ; and on the Pacific 
coast rises again above the thirty-fifth degree of latitude. For 
the winter, the isothermal line of Andersonville again commences 
on the Atlantic coast, near the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude, 
and passes through Fort Johnston, N. C. ; Charleston, S. C. ; near 
Savannah, Ga. ; and Montgomery, Ala. ; Jackson, Miss. ; Natclii- 
toches. La. ; Austin, Forts Lincoln and Clarke, Texas ; passing 
in Texas as low as the twenty-ninth degree of latitude, and 
then rising toward the Pacific coast, and passing through St. 
Angelos and San Francisco, strikes the Pacific Ocean about the 
thirty-seventh degree and fifty minutes north latitude. For the 
year the isothermal line commences on the Atlantic coast near the 
thirty-fourth degree of north latitude, passes through Fort John- 
ston, N. C. ; Montgomery, Ala. ; Jackson, Miss. ; and descends 
in Texas below the thirtieth degree, and in Mexico below the 
twenty-fifth degree, and ascends toward the Pacific coast as high 
as the thirty-seventh degree of north latitude. 

It is evident, therefore, from these facts, that the climate of An- 
dersonville is similar in most respects to that of the in- ciimate of

apply to Andersonville. According to these observations, during 
two years, the mean temperatures for the different months were :

mean for spring of 66.7°, summer, 79.8°, autumn, 65.3°, winter,

summer, 16.5, autumn, 12, winter, 7.8 ; for entire year, 46.7 
inches. 

In conclusion, as far as my physical and pathological investiga- 
tions extended, I was compelled to believe that the dis- 
eases which proved so fatal to the Federal prisoners con- 
fined at Andersonville, Georgia, were due to causes other than 
those connected with the soil, waters, and climate. The heat of 
this climate may have promoted the rapid decomposition of the 
filth wkich, in violation of all hygienic laws, was allowed to ac- 
cumulate in the Stockade and hospital grounds ; and also in itself 
the heat may have proved a cause of debility ; but still the fearful 
mortality could not properly be referred to this condition of cli- 
mate, or to all the other elements of climate combined. 

No blame can be attached to the Confederate authorities for the 
collection of the Federal prisoners at this elevated and healthy 
locality, which was more salubrious than one half the territory of 
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

THE STOCKADE. 

The Confederate Military Prison at Andersonville, Ga., consists 
of a strong stockade, twenty feet in height, inclosino; construc- 

r. 1 1 n^i 1 1 -r- i ^ tion of the 

twenty-seven acres oi land. Ihe stockade is rormed oi stockade. 
strong pine logs firmly planted in the ground. The main stockade 
is surrounded by two other similar rows of pine logs, the middle 
stockade being sixteen feet high, and the outer twelve feet. These 
are intended for offense and defense. If the inner stockade should 
at any time be forced by the prisoners, the second forms another 
line of defense ; whilst in case of an attempt to dehver the pris- 
oners by a force operating upon the exterior, the outer hne forms 
an admirable protection to the Confederate troops, and a most for- 
midable obstacle to cavalry or infantry. 

The four angles of the outer line are strengthened by earth- 
works upon commanding eminences, from which the cannon, in 
case of an outbreak amongst the prisoners, may sweep the entire 
inclosure ; and it was designed to connect these works by a line of 
rifle-pits, running zigzag around the outer stockade. The rifle- 
pits have been but partially completed. 

The ground inclosed by the innermost stockade lies in the form 
of a parallelogram, the longer diameter running almost character of 

1 1 1 1 rrii • -11 IT tlie inclosed 

due north and south, ihis space mcludes the northern ground. 
and southern opposing sides of two hills, between which a stream 
of water runs from west to east. The surface soil of these hills 
is composed chiefly of sand, with varying admixtures of clay and 
oxide of iron. The clay is sufficient to give a considerable degree 
of consistency to the soil. The internal structure of the hills, as 
revealed by the deep wells, is similar to that already described.

AMOUNT OF SPACE FOR EACH PRISONER. 



The alternate beds of clay and sand, as well as the oxide of iron, 
which forms in its various combinations a cement to the sand, 
allow of extensive tunneling. 

The Federal prisoners not only constructed numerous dirt huts 
with balls of clay and sand taken from the wells which 
they have excavated all over these hills, but they liave 
also tunneled extensively in all directions from these wells. A 
large number of tunnels, and some of them of great length, have 
been discovered. 

The lower portions of these hills, bordering on the stream, are 
wet and boggy from the constant oozing of water. 



Dirt huts 
and tunnels 



RELATIONS OF PRISONERS TO AREA OF STOCKADE. 

The Stockade was built to accommodate only 10,000 prisoners, 
and included originally seventeen acres. Near the close 
of the month of June, the area was enlarged by the ad- 
dition of ten acres. The ground added was situated 
upon the northern slope of the largest hill. 

The following table presents a view of the density of 
the population of the prison at different periods.

Within the circumscribed area of the Stockade, the Federal 
Amount of prisoncrs were compelled to perform all the offices of life, 
— cooking, washing, urinating, defecation, exercise, and 
sleeping. During the month of March the prison was 
less crowded than at any subsequent time, and then tlie average 
space of ground to each prisoner was only 98.7 feet, or less than 
eleven square yards. The Federal prisoners were gathered from 
all parts of the Confederate States east of the Mississippi, and 
crowded into this confined space, until, in the month of June, the 



INTERNAL POLICE. 503 

imber of square feet of ground to each prisoner was 
only 33.2, or less than four square yards. 

These figures represent the condition of the Stockade in a bet- 
ter light even than it really was, for a considerable breadth of land 
along the stream, flowing from west to east between the hills, was 
low and boggy, and was covered with the excrements of the men, 
and thus rendered wholly uninhabitable, and in fact useless for 
every purpose except that of defecation. 

The pines and other small trees and shrubs which originally 
were scattered sparsely over these hills, were in a short pj^^g ^^^ 
time cut down and consumed by the prisoners for fire- treeTso^u^ 
wood; and no shade-tree was left in the entire inclos- fOTfi"ewood 
ure of the Stockade. With their characteristic inge- construct 
nuity and industry, the Federals constructed for them- ^°s^^*^- 
selves small huts and caves, and attempted to shield themselves 
from the rain and sun, and night damps and dew. But few tents 
were distributed to the prisoners, and these were in most cases 
old, torn, and rotten. Tents had long since been almost entirely 
abandoned by the Confederate forces in the field, and the supply 
of cloth was barely sufficient to meet the demands of the Hospital 
Department. 

In the location and arrangement of the tents and huts within 
the Stockade, no order appears to have been followed ; in ^^ ^^.^^j. ^^^ 
fact, regular streets appeared to be out of the question in arrlngement 
so crowded an area, especially, too, as large bodies of °^ ^"**" 
prisoners were from time to time added suddenly without any pre- 
vious preparation. 

The irregular arrangement of the huts, and imperfect shelters, 
was very unfavorable for the maintenance of a proper system of 
police. The police and internal economy of the prison was left 
almost entirely in the hands of the prisoners themselves. 

INTERNAL POLICE OF STOCKADE. 

The duties of the Confederate soldiers acting as guards are 
limited chiefly to the occupation of the boxes or lookouts confederate 
ranged around the Stockade at regular intervals, and 'actelToniyas 
to the manning of the batteries at the angles of the fil^e'^^f 'the*' 
Stockade. ^^^"^^^"^^ 

Even judicial matters pertaining to themselves, as the detection 
and punishment of such crimes as theft and murder, are judicial 
abandoned to the prisoners themselves. to*thTpris^ 

A striking instance of this occurred in the month of 



oners. 



504 INTERNAL POLICE. 

July, when the Federals tried, condemned, and hanged six of their 
oivn number^ who had been convicted of stealing and of robbing and 
murdering their fellow-prisoners. 

They were all hanged upon the same day, upon gallows con- 
stmcted by the Federal prisoners within the Stockade for this 
especial purpose. The condemned were guarded by their fellow- 
prisoners, armed with sharpened stakes, the points of which had 
been hardened in the fire, and with large clubs. Thousands of 
the prisoners gathered around to witness the executions which they 
had decreed. 

The Confederate authorities did not interfere at all in these pro- 
stones of ceedinejs. 

robbery and r" . 

murder. In this coUcction of men from all parts of the civil- 

ized world, every phase of human character was represented — 
the stronger preyed upon the weaker; and even the sick, who 
were unable to defend themselves, were robbed of their scanty 
supphes of food and clothing. Dark stories were afloat of men 
both sick and well, who were murdered at night, strangled to 
death by their comrades, for scant supplies of clothing or money. 
I heard a sick and wounded Federal prisoner accuse his nurse, a 
fellow-prisoner, of the United States army, of having stealthily, 
during his sleep, inoculated his wounded arm with gangrene, that 
he might destroy his life and fall heir to his clothing. 

The excuse given for the absence of Confederate guards and 
The absence policc withiu the iuclosurc of the Stockade, M^as the in- 
Tte guard?"^' sufficieucy of men capable of performing military duty. 
iSk)s"ure ^ ^t tbe time of the estabhshment, and during the ex- 
SlTo? istence, of the Military Prison at Andersonville, the Con- 
"^°' federate government was sorely pressed on every side ; 

the best States were being overrun and desolated; and, with all the 
forces that could be gathered from all quarters, the main armies 
are still largely outnumbered, and are being steadily pressed back, 
leaving a desolated and ruined country. It is with difliculty that 
the Confederate government can spare at the present time of 
trouble and distress and disaster between two and three thousand 
reserves, composed of old men and boys (many of whom are 
wholly unfit to perform even guard duty), to guard this large num- 
ber of prisoners, which they have ever been anxious to exchange, 
and which the Confederate authorities believe to be forced upon 
their hands by the persistent action of the United States Govern- 
ment. 

Similar excuses are given for the crowded condition of the 




INTERNAL POLICE. 505 

kockade. Thus it is affirmed that the gigantic operations, as well 
as tlie sudden and formidable raids of the United States forces in 
Virginia, around Richmond, and in Northwestern Georgia, have 
compelled the sudden and continuous removal of prisoners of war 
to a place of safety. 

The military operations of the United States have reduced the

Confederacy, which are now in a most deplorable con- army, 
dition, is taxed with the transportation of troops, sick and wounded 
soldiers, prisoners of war, munitions of war, and provisions for the 
armies in the field. Notwithstanding the utmost exertions of the 
Confederate authorities, the armies in the field are, as is well 
known to the Surgeon-General, but poorly fed and clothed at the 
best, and ofttimes are upon less than one quarter rations. And 
were it not for supplies received in foraging and through private 
sources, it would appear almost impossible that the Confederate 
army should be able to keep the field with any thing like its pres- 
ent numbers. The Surgeon-General is also well acquainted with 
the fact that, at the present time, large numbers, and it might al- 
most be said entire armies, of Confederate troops, are suffering 
with symptoms of the scurvy ; and hospital gangrene and pysemia 
are making fearful ravages amongst the poorly fed and badly 
clothed and imperfectly treated wounded of the army of Ten- 
nessee, now contending for the possession of Georgia. Again the 
Confederate currency has depreciated almost to a nominal value, 
and large numbers of the citizens are refusing to take it in the 
purchase of provisions or lumber. In this section of Georgia the 
means of cutting and hauling lumber are scarce, not only from the 
original absence of machinery and scarcity of surplus horses and 
mules, but also from the extensive destruction of the saw-mills by 
the contending armies in the northern parts of the State, and from 
the natural decay of machinery during three years of war, in a 
country cut off from all intercourse with the surrounding world, 
and possessing at its best estate but few workshops for the manufac- 
ture of machinery. Axes, spades, tools, and implements of all 
kinds are exceedingly scarce in this section of country ; and the 
State has been so often under the hands of the impressing officer, 
that it is difficult to obtain teams for hauling lumber. 

Notwithstanding that my labors relate to the investigation of 
the causes and nature of diseases, I do not deem it improper thus 



506 FILTHY CONDITION. 

to make a simple statement to the Surgeon-General of these facts, 
in connection with those results of my labors which appear to re- 
flect upon the action of certain officers. 

FILTHY CONDITION OF STOCKADE. — VAST ACCUMULATION OF HU- 
MAN EXCREMENTS IN THE LOW GROUNDS AND ALONG THE BANKS 
OF THE SMALL STREAM. 

The large number of men confined within the comparatively 
small space of the Stockade, soon covered the surface of the low 
grounds with their excrements. 

The arrangements for the sinks over the lower portions of the 
Accumuia- Stream, were imperfect, and the excrements were in 
crements. large mcasurc deposited so near the borders of the 
stream as not to be washed away, or else accumulated upon the 
low boggy ground. The volume of water was not sufficient to 
wash away the faeces, and they accumulated in such quantities in 
the lower portion of the stream as to form a mass of liquid excre- 
ment. Heavy rains caused the waters of the stream to rise, and, 
as the arrangements for the passage of the increased amounts of 
water out of the Stockade were insufficient, the liquid faeces over- 
flowed the low grounds and covered them several inches, after the 
subsidence of the waters. The action of the hot sun upon this 
putrefying mass of excrements and fragments of bread and meat 
and bones, excited most rapid fermentation, and developed a hor- 
rible stench. Improvements were projected for the removal of 
this filth, and for the prevention of its accumulation, but they were 
only partially and imperfectly carried out. 

As the health of the prisoners was reduced by confinement, 
want of exercise, improper diet, and by scurvy, diarrhoea, and 
dysentery, they were unable to evacuate their bowels within the 
stream or along its banks, and the excrements were deposited at 
the very doors of their tents. 

The accommodations for the sick were in keeping with those for

Bick. J^rom the organization or the prison, i^ebruary z4th, to 

May 22d, the sick were treated within the Stockade. In the 
crowded condition of the Stockade, and with the tents and huts 
clustered thickly around the hospital, it was impossible to secure 
proper ventilation, or to maintain the necessary police. The 
Federal prisoners also made frequent forays upon the hospital 
stores, and stole the food and clothing of the sick. 

The hospital was on the 22d of May removed to its present site 
without the Stockade, and five acres of ground, covered with oaks

fand pines, appropriated to the use of the sick. The supply of 
(medical officers has been insufficient. The nurses and attendants 
:upon the sick have been in most cases Federal prisoners, who had 
no incentive to proper action. 

From this condition of thino;s it is not wonderfiil that from Feb- 
'ruary 24th to September 21st, 1864, 9479 deaths (nearly one 
(third of the entire number of prisoners) should have been re- 
[ corded. 

CONDITION OF THE CONFEDERATE MILITARY PRISON (STOCKADE) AT 
ANDERSONVILLE, DURING MY PATHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS, SEP- 
TEMBER, 1864. 

At the time of my visit to Anderson ville, a large number of the 
Federal prisoners had been removed to Millen, Savannah, Removal of 
Charleston, and other points of the Confederacy, in prisonersm 
anticipation of an advance by General Sherman's forces of anad- 
from Atlanta, with the desiim of liberating their captive General 

1 -n 1 nn i i Sherman's 

brethren ; but still about litteen thousand persons re- forces, 
mained confined within the limits of the Stockade and Confederate 
States Mihtary Prison Hospital. 

In the Stockade, with the exception of the damp low lands bor- 
dering the small stream, the surface was covered with huts Conditioa of 
and small, ragged tents, and parts of blankets and frag- ade. 
ments of oil-cloth, coats, and blankets stretched upon sticks. The 
tents and huts were not arranged according to any order ; and 
there was in most parts of the inclosure scarcely room for two 
men to walk abreast between the tents and huts. I observed men 
urinating and evacuating their bowels at the very tent doors and 
around the little vessels in which they were cooking their food. 

Small pits not more than a foot or two deep, nearly filled with 
soft offensive faeces, were everywhere seen, and emitted, under a 
hot sun, a strong and disgusting odor. Masses of corn-bread, 
bones, old rags, and filth of every description, were scattered 
around or accumulated in large piles. 

The dead of the previous night lay in the narrow streets with- 
out any covering, and with their mouths open, their limbs Disposition 
and necks contorted, as they had been left in the last °^ *^* ^'^*^- 
agonies of death, and with their open glazed eyeballs staring into 
the void above. In many cases no friendly hand, even amongst 
their own comrades and fellow-soldiers, was found to perform the 
last sad offices during the final struggle. Each day the dead from 
the Stockade were carried out and deposited upon the ground, 
under a bush arbor, just outside of the southwestern gate. From 



508 CONDITION OF STOCKADE, SEPTEMBER, 1864. 

thence they were earned m carts to the burying-ground, about one 
quarter of a mile northwest of the prison. The dead were buried 
without coffins, side by side, in trenches four feet deep. Each 
body was marked with a head-board, numbered ; and the numbers 
were entered upon a record book, so that any body might be iden- 
tified. The soil of the graveyard was composed of a mixture of 
sand and clay. I observed that innumerable large green flies 
swarmed over the red earth covering the dead, and in some places 
they even filled the cracks in the ground. 

I inspected from first to last two or three hundred corpses, and 
Appearance iu cvcry casc they were extremely emaciated and covered 
corpses. with filth and vermin. During the entire period that I 
remained at Anderson ville, I did not see a single corpse in good 
flesh. I was somewhat surprised at this, as I had been informed 
that the men would frequently die without any apparent disease. 

The sick were almost all suffering with scurvy, diarrhoea, and 
Theprevau- dyscutery. As they received but little attention from 
ing diseases, ^jjgjj. fellow-prisoncrs, or from the regularly appointed 
nurses, they were compelled to exert themselves at all times to 
attend to the calls of nature, and hence they retained the power 
of moving about to within a comparatively short period before the 
close of life. 

Many of the sudden deaths were also referable to the effects of 
Sudden scurvy. In the post-mortem examinations of the bodies 
Stobte^to"^' ^^ those who had died from scurvy, or from diarrhoea, 
scurvy. . dysentery, and gangrene complicated with scurvy, I 
found the heart pale and soft, the blood deficient in colored cor- 
puscles, and the pleural and pericardial cavities and the ventricles 
of the brain filled with serous effusion. Sudden death frequently 
took place upon slight exertion, and appeared to be referable 
mainly to failure in the muscular power of the heart and of 
the respiratory muscles. The softening of the muscles of the 
heart to which I have alluded was not a post-mortem change, for 
my examinations were made within a few hours after death, be- 
fore any post-mortem alterations of the structures had taken place. 

The frequency of sudden death in scorbutic patients has been 
Sudden notcd by various observers. Thus, in the history of Lord 
sclJrvy noted Ausou's voyagc rouud the world, published in London in 
obslrvera.^ 1748, it is Stated that when he came into the South Sea, 
where his men were afflicted with scurvy in the most terrible 
manner, the malady was frequently accompanied with a difficulty 
of breathing, which was the most striking and deadly of all the 



CONDITION OF STOCKADE, SEPTEMBER, 1864. 

Many of the men, althougli confined to their nam- 

locks, eat and drank heartily, were cheerfiil, and talked with 

mch seeming vigor, and in a strong tone of voice ; and yet on 

ftieir being the least moved, although it was only from one part of 

Ehe ship to another, and that in their hammocks, they have im- 

lediately expired ; and others who have confided in their seeming 

strength, and have resolved to get out of their hammocks, have 

ied before they could reach the deck. And it was no uncommon 

ling for those who could do some kind of duty, and walk the deck, 

drop down in an instant in any endeavor to act with the utmost 

gor. 

Poupart, whose observations were published in 1699, and who 
appears to have performed a large number of post-mortems in this 
disease, remarks that in all those who died suddenly in scurvy, 
the auricles of the heart were as large as a man's fist, and were 
full of coagulated blood. Sydenham, in his " Work on Acute and 
Chronic Diseases," notices as one of the characteristic symptoms 
of scurvy, the difficulty of breathing, especially after exercise. 

Doctor David Macbride, in his " Methodical Introduction to the 
Theory and Practice of Physic " (London, 1772 ; chap. vi. 
Description of Scurvy, pp. 617-618), thus describes the same 
symptoms in scurvy : — 

" But what is very remarkable in this disease, notwithstanding the 
various and immense load of distress under which the patients labored, 
there is no sickness of the stomach, the appetite keeps up, and the 
senses remain entire, almost to the very last ; when lying at rest they 
make no complaints, and feel little distress or pain ; but the moment 
they attempt to rise or stir themselves, then the breathing becomes 
difficult, with a kind of shortness or catching, with great oppression, 
and sometimes they have been known to fall into a fatal syncope. This 
catching of the breath upon motion, with the loss of strength, dejection 
of spirit, and rotten gums, are held as the essential or distinguishing 

symptoms of the disease As people far gone in the scurvy are 

apt to faint, and even expire, on being moved and brought out into the 
fresh air, the utmost care and circumspection are requisite when it is 
necessary to stir or remove them." 

Gilbert Blane, in his " Observations on the Diseases of Sea- 
men " (3d ed., London, 1799, p. 483), remarks : — 

"The most remarkable symptom next to these, is a lassitude and 
depression of spirits. A small degree of exercise produces laborious 
breathing. This, and pains of the thorax, are some of the most dis- 
tressing symptoms in the advanced stages of the disease. Debility and 



610 CONDITION OF STOCKADE, SEPTEMBER, 1864. 

lassitude increase as the disease advances ; and these, together with 
pains of the limbs, and contractions of the hams, confine the diseased 
person to bed ; and any rough motion, or attempt to raise himself to the 
erect posture, is apt to bring on syncope. In the most advanced stages 
of the disease, they frequently expire on occasions of this kind, or in 
the act of carrying them on shore for cure, upon their arrival in port. 
In the same stage of it, the callus of broken limbs is dissolved or ab- 
sorbed, so that the part comes to be in the state of a recent fracture." 

Other observers have recorded similar facts. We deem it un- 
Faets record- necessary, however, to multiply testimony beyond that 
Sou^j^m' already given, and the following facts recorded by Sur- 
unYted g^on J. M. Foltz, U. S. Navy, in his Report on Scorbii- 

states Navy. ^.^^^ ^^ j^ appeared on board the United States squadron 
blockading the ports in the Gulf of Mexico, in the summer of 
1864: — ^ 

" The symptoms of the disease, as they appeared on board the 
Maritan, varied materially from such as are laid down in books. Las- 
situde and indisposition to muscular energy were not among the symp- 
toms which ushered in the disease ; there were generally great activity, 
and not unfrequently cheerfulness, good appetite, and sound sleep at 
night, for weeks after the teeth were loosened, the gums ulcerated, the 
limbs edematous and discolored. The nervous system was among the 
last to be invaded, and then it was not an indisposition to corporeal 
exertion, but an actual disability. The countenance became pale, lan- 
guid, cadaverous ; the respiration oppressed, irregular ; and the pulse 
feeble, fluttering, intermittent, sinmltaneous with this muscular prostra- 
tion. Slight efforts to turn, sit up, or move about, were followed by 
tremors and syncope. When this class of symptoms set in, the strides 
of the disease were rapid, every thing indicating, without speedy aid, an 
early fatal result. In every case, when the disease was so far ad- 
vanced, the respiratory system was much involved. There was also a 
manifest reduction of the temperature of the body in every aggravated 
case. In two cases, well developed symptoms of angina pectoris 
presented, and the paroxysms were accompanied with the most dis- 
tressing pains in the chest and arms. The patients themselves ex- 
pressed the greatest apprehension of suffocation. But these cases re- 
covered from this angina, on their transfer to the hospital ; but when we 
last saw them, their emaciated and tottering frames gave the incontest- 
ible evidence of permanently impaired constitutions. There were but 
two classes of symptoms which made such irreparable inroads on the 
constitution ; from all the other symptoms, the health became again 
perfectly restored ; these were the oppressed, laborious, and difficult 
respiration ; the other, irregular, obstructed, and imperfect action of 
1 American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1864, p. 47. 



CONDITION OF STOCKADE, SEPTEMBER, 18617 

the heart. Paroxysms of dyspnoea were frequent in these cases ; the 
inspirations were short and rapid, and performed chiefly by the action 
of the intercostal muscles, and were performed with much labor by the 
patient, imparting to the countenance the impression of suffocation, 
accompanied by palpitations, which compelled the patient to sit up. 
The contractions and dilatations of the heart were irregular, at times 
intermitting and indistinct, with a great sense of anxiety at the precor- 
dia. In the midst of these symptoms, the pulse was scarcely percep- 
tible at the wrist, the extremities were cold, and the countenance 
assumed a leaden hue. Auscultation, so far as practicable on board a 
crowded ship of war, gave but little aid in detecting the character of 
organic derangement. In several cases the sounds emitted were those 
of hypertrophy ; but the number of these cases were limited, compared 
with the indications of atrophy and diminution of the cardiac functions." 

The low grounds bordering the stream were covered with hu- 
man excrements and filth of all kinds, which in many stench from 
places were alive with working maggots. An mdescnb- grounds 
able sickenino" stench arose from this fermentino- mass of the stream. 
human dung and filth. The prisoners appeared to be utterly cal- 
lous to this filth, and it appeared to be utterly impossible to estab- 
lish and carry out the proper hygienic rules without the constant 
presence of a Confederate guard within the Stockade. The Con- 
federate force, as we have before stated, was barely sufficient to 
act as a guard on the outside of the prison ; and the internal 
police was left almost entirely, from necessity, to the prisoners 
themselves. And although the quagmire was covered by order of 
the commandant of the interior of the prison, at the suggestion of 
the medical officers, with dry sand, it was soon again covered with 
human excrements — the prisoners refusing or neglecting to use 
the privies arranged over the stream. 

There were near five thousand seriously ill Federals in the 
Stockade and Confederate States Military Prison Hospi- j-j^g ^^^^^_ 
tal, and the deaths exceeded one hundred daily; and I'^sterktu^y 
large numbers of the prisoners who were walking about, deat^hs'^more 
and who had never been entered upon the sick list, were hindred 
suffering from severe and incurable diarrhoea, dysentery, ^^'^^'' 
and scurvy. Upon one occasion, as I was passing through the 
Stockade, a stout Irishman, sitting at his tent door, showed me a 
large molar tooth which he had just extracted with his fingers, and 
I found that all his teeth were loose, and the gums greatly swollen 
and ulcerated. 

I visited two thousand sick within the Stockade, lying under four

long slieds, which had been built at the northern portion for bar- 
racks. 

At this time only one medical officer was in attendance, whereas 
Deficient at Icast twcntj mcdical officers should have been em- 
attendance, ployed. I was informed that several of the medical 
officers appointed to attend the sick within the Stockade were sick, 
and that the duty was so arduous, and the exhalations from the 
sick and filth of the prison were so deleterious, that it was impossi- 
ble for the medical officers to stand the service for any length of 
time. Great difficulty was experienced by the surgeon in charge 
of the post to induce medical officers and physicians to accept 
positions in the Stockade or Hospital, on account of the absence of 
many of the facilities for the treatment of the sick, and the great 
and numerous depressing agencies, and the consequent unsatisfac- 
tory results of practice. So distressing was the service, and so 
great were the obstacles to successful and satisfactory practice 
amongst these men, whose constitutions had been sapped by the loss 
of all hope of exchange on the part of their government, and by 
long confinement upon an unvarying diet, that the more energetic 
Confederate surgeons and assistant-surgeons endeavored to get 
transfers to other fields of labor, preferring the hardships and ex- 
posures of service at the front. It is also to be considered that not 
only is there a scarcity of physicians in the Confederacy, but it is 
especially difficult to command the services of competent physicians 
in this sparsely settled country. Added to all this, the gigantic 
military operations in Georgia, attended with the utter destruction 
of her territory in the rear of the Federal forces, and with the se- 
rious wounding of thousands of Confederate troops, have absorbed 
the sympathies and attention, and commanded the abilities of al- 
most every available physician in the State. The hospitals of the 
army of Tennessee have been in constant motion for months, fol- 
lowing the continuous series of disasters and evacuations in North- 
ern Georgia, and are crowded with seriously wounded, suffering in 
many cases with the most extensive hospital gangrene, and with 
fatal pyaemia. Every town and village in Georgia is filled with the 
sick and wounded of the army of Tennessee, and the privations 
and sufferings of the Confederate troops, even amongst their own 
countrymen, are great beyond description, and equal to those of 
any armies in ancient or modern times. With the whole energies 
of this people engaged in such a terrible and unequal struggle, it is 
not singular that medical talent of the highest order should be 
scarce, and difficult of access and control at the interior posts.

he very conditions and results of the contest also, without doubt, 
tend to excite such prejudices as would disincline medical officers 
from voluntarily seeking service amongst the captive enemies, who 
are the representatives of those who are seeking to conquer and 
desolate their native land. 

I found no record of the sick in the Stockade previous to Sep- 
tember 14th. It appears that after the removal of the Deficient 
hospital, no record was kept of the diseases treated within the sick in 

the Stock- 

the prison, and the following includes all the statistics ade. 

which I was able to collect : —

prevailing diseases. 

I was surprised to find but few cases of malarial fever, and no

few. absence of the different forms of malarial fever may be 

accounted for on the supposition that the artificial atmosphere of 
the Stockade, crowded densely with human beings and loaded with 
animal exhalations, was unfavorable to the existence and action of 
the malarial poison. 

The absence of typhoid and typhus fevers, amongst all the 
Absence of causcs which are supposed to produce these diseases, ap- 
tyjhoid*^*^ peared to be due to the fact that the great majority of 
fever. ^j^g prisoucrs had been in captivity in Virginia, at Belle 

Island, and in other parts of the Confederacy for months, and even 
as long as two years, and during this time they had been subjected 
to the same bad influences, and those who had not had these fevers 
before, either had them during their confinement in Confederate 
prisons, or else their systems from long exposure were proof against 
their action. 

The effects of scurvy were manifest on every hand, and in all 
Effects of its various stages, from the muddy pale complexion, pale

and fetid breath ; to the dusky, dirty, leaden complexion, swollen

modically flexed, painful and hardened extremities, spontaneous 
hemorrhages from mucous canals, and large, ill-conditioned spread- 
ing ulcers covered with a dark purplish fungous growth. 

In some of the cases of scurvy the parotid glands were greatly 
swollen, and in some instances to such an extent as to preclude en- 
tirely the power of articulating. In several cases of dropsy of the 
abdomen and lower extremities supervening upon scurvy, the pa- 
tients affirmed that previously to the appearance of the dropsy, 
they had suffered with profuse and obstinate diarrhoea ; and that 
when this was checked by a change of diet from indian corn-bread, 
cooked with the husk, to rice, the dropsy appeared. The severe pains 
and livid patches were frequently associated with swellings in va-

nous parts, and especially in the lower extremities, accompanied 
with stiffness and contractions of the knee-joints and ankles, and 
often with a brawny feel of the parts, as if lymph had been effused 
between the integuments and aponeuroses, preventing the motion 
of the skin over the swollen parts. 

Many of the prisoners believed that the scurvy was contagious ; 
and I saw men guarding their wells and springs, fearing lest some 
man suffering with the scurvy might use the waters and thus poison 
them. 

I observed also numerous cases of hospital gangrene, and of 
spreading scorbutic ulcers, which had supervened upon Cases of 

slight injuries. gangrene. 

The scorbutic ulcers presented a dark, purple, fungoid, elevated 
surface, with livid, swollen edges, and exuded a thin, foetid, sanious 
fluid, instead of pus. Many ulcers which originated from the scor- 
butic condition of the system appeared to become truly gangrenous, 
assuming all the characteristics of hospital gangrene. 

From the crowded condition, filthy habits, bad diet, dejected and 
depressed condition of the prisoners, their systems had become so 
disordered that the smallest abrasion of the skin, from the rubbing 
of a shoe, or from the effects of the hot sun, or from the prick of 
a splinter, or from scratching a mosquito's bite, in some cases took 
on rapid and frightful ulceration and gangrene. 

The long use of salt meat, often improperly cured, as well as 
the almost total deprivation of vegetables and fruit, appeared to be 
the chief causes of the scurvy. 

I carefully examined the bakery and the bread ftirnished to the 
prisoners, and found that they were supplied almost en- character of 
tirely with corn-bread, from which the husk had not been supplied, 
separated. In this respect the meal did not differ from that issued 
to the Confederate soldiers in the field. The scarcity of sieves in 
the Confederacy was the excuse urged for the issue of unbolted 
corn meal to the Confederate soldiers, as well as to the prisoners of 
war. The husk of the Indian corn appeared to act as an irritant 
to the alimentary canal, without adding any nutriment to the bread. 
As far as my examination extended, no fault could be found with 
the mode in which the bread was baked — the difficulty lay in the 
failure to separate the husk from the corn meal. I strongly urged 
the preparation of large quantities of soup made from the cow and 
calves' heads, with the brains and tongue, to which a liberal supply 
of sweet potatoes and vegetables might have been advantageously 
added. The materials existed for the preparation of such soup,

with little or no additional expense. Such aliment would have 
been not only highly nutritious, but it would also have acted as an 
efficient remedial agent for the removal of the scorbutic condition. 

The sick within the Stockade lay under several long sheds, 
The sick lay which wcre originally built for barracks. These sheds 
boardfin covercd two floors which were open on all sides. The 
theSto'^k?"^ sick lay upon bare boards, or upon such ragged blankets 
*"*®" as they possessed, without, as far as I observed, any bed- 

ding, or even straw. 

Pits for the reception of foeces were dug within a few feet of the 
lower floor, and they were almost never unoccupied by those suffer- 
ing with diarrhoea and dysentery. 

The haggard, distressed countenances of these miserable, com- 
Appearance plaiuiug, dcjcctcd Hviug skclctous cryiug for medicine and 
oners^aS" food, and cursiug their government for its brutality in re- 
piaiatsTf fiising to exchange prisoners, and the ghastly corpses with 
Stetes^ov^ their glazed eyeballs, staring up into vacant space, with 
ernment. ^.j^^ £jgg swarmiug dowu their open and grinning mouths, 
and over their ragged clothes, infested with lice, as they lay amongst 
the sick and dying, formed a picture of helpless, hopeless misery, 
which it would be impossible to portray by words or by the brush. 
A feeling of disappointment and even of resentment on account 
of the action of the United States Government upon the subject 
of the exchange of prisoners, appeared to be wide-spread, and the 
apparent hopeless nature of the negotiations for the general ex- 
change of prisoners appeared to be a cause of universal regret, and 
of deep and injurious despondency. I heard some of the prisoners 
go so far as to exonerate the Confederate government from any 
charge of intentionally subjecting them to protracted confinement, 
with its necessary and unavoidable suffering, in a country cut off 
from all intercourse with foreign nations, and sorely pressed on all 
sides ; whilst on the other hand, they charged their prolonged cap- 
tivity upon their own government, which was attempting to make 
the negro equal to the white man. 

That I have not misrepresented the sentiments of these prisoners 
is clearly demonstrated by the following resolutions passed a short 
time after my examination of the Stockade, by these same Ander- 
sonville prisoners who had been transferred to Savannah. These 
resolutions were published in the Savannah papers. 

« At a mass meeting held September 28th, 3 864, by the Federal pris- 
oners confined at Savannah, Ga., it was unanimously agreed that the 



RESOLUTIONS FOR EXCHANGE. 517 

following resolutions be sent to the President of the United States, in 
the hope that he might thereby take such steps as in his f^o°\"J°ij"* 
wisdom he may think necessary for our speedy exchange or the prisoners 

parole. meeting. 

" Resolved, That while we would declare our unbounded love for the 
Union, for the home of our fathers, and for the graves of those we ven- 
erate, we would beg most respectfully that our situation as prisoners be 
diligently inquired into, and every obstacle consistent with the honor 
and dignity of the government at once removed. 

^^ Resolved^ That while allowing the Confederate authorities all due 
praise for the attention paid to prisoners, numbers of our men are daily 
consigned to early graves, in the prime of manhood, far from home and 
kindred, and this is not caused intentionally by the Confederate govern- 
ment, but by the force of circumstances ; the prisoners are obliged to 
go without shelter, and, in a great portion of cases, without medicine. 

" Resolved, That whereas ten thousand of our brave comrades have 
descended into an untimely grave within the last six months, and as we 
believe their death was caused by the difference of climate, the peculiar 
kind and insufficiency of food, and lack of proper medical treatment ; 
and whereas those difficulties still remain, we would declare as our firm 
belief that, unless we are speedily exchanged, we have no other alterna- 
tive but to share the lamentable fate of our comrades. Must this thing 
still go on ? Is there no hope ? 

" Resolved, That whereas the cold and inclement season of the year 
is fast approaching, we hold it to be our duty as soldiers and citizens 
of the United States to inform our Government that the majority of our 
prisoners are without proper clothing, in some cases being almost naked, 
and are without blankets to protect us from the scorching sun by day, 
or the heavy dews by night, and we would most respectfully request the 
Government to make some arrangement whereby we can be supplied 
with these to us necessary articles. 

" Resolved, That whereas the term of service of many of our com- 
rades having expired, they, having served truly and faithfully for the 
terms of their several enlistments, would most respectfully ask their 
Government, Are they to be forgotten ? Are past services to be 
ignored ? Not having seen their wives and little ones for over three 
years, they would most respectfully but firmly request the Government 
to make some arrangements whereby they can be exchanged or 
paroled. 

" Resolved, That whereas, in the fortune of war, it was our lot to be- 
come prisoners, we have suffered patiently, and are still willing to suffer, 
if by so doing we can benefit the country ; but we must most respect- 
fully beg to say, that we are not willing to suffer to further the ends of 
any party or clique to the detriment of our honor, our families, and our 
country, and we beg that this affair be explained to us, that we may 



618 TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR. 

continue to hold the Government in that respect which is necessary to 
make a good citizen and soldier. 

(Signed) 

P. BRADLEY, 

Chairman of Committee in behalf of Prisoners. 

When soldiers surrender, our action (placing it in no higher 
Views of the lig^t than that of policy, and leaving out of view entirely 
S^ctLJ^'the t^^6 higher and more noble dictates of humanity and 
pS^ers^? Christianity) should be to treat them in such a manner, 
^*''" that surrender in battle will have no special terrors. The 

fear of great suffering and even of almost certain death in impris- 
onment only renders the enemy more stubborn and vindictive in 
battle. Strict justice to the gallant men of the Confederate armies 
who have been, or who may be, so unfortunate as to be compelled 
to surrender, demands that the Confederate government should 
adopt that course which will best secure their health and comfort in 
captivity, or at least leave our enemies without the shadow of an 
excuse for any violation of the rules of civilized warfare in the 
treatment of prisoners. 

It is worthy of note, in connection with the preceding descrip- 
severai hun- tiou of the couditiou of the prisoners within the Stockade, 
oners reieas- that scvcral huudrcd of the Federal prisoners had been 
parole. released on parole, and filled all the sub-offices as clerks, 

carpenters, cooks, bakers, ration-dividers, nurses, ward-masters, 
stewards, and druggists. These men who had the Hberty of the 
entire post were well clothed, and presented a stout, healthy appear- 
ance, and as a general rule appeared to be in better circumstances, 
and to enjoy much more robust health than the Confederate troops 
guarding the prison. 

To these paroled prisoners was confided not only the prepara- 
tion and cooking of the food, but also the distribution of the rations 
to the sick and well within the Stockade and Hospital. 



CHAPTER THIRD. 

CONFEDERATE MILITARY PRISON HOSPITAL AT ANDERSONVILLE, GA. 

Physical and Moral Condition of Sick. — Defective Hygiene and Police of Hospital. — Accu- 
mulation of Filth. — Flies. — Mosquitoes. — Manner of Disposing of the Dead. — Defect- 
ive Cooking Arrangements. — Improper Food for Sick. — Foul Air of Filthy Tents. 

The Hospital is situated near the southeastern corner situation of 
of the Stockade, and covers about five acres of ground. Ac^cumuiS^' 

The larger forest trees, as the pine and oak, have been *^°° ^^ *"^" 
left in their natural state, and furnish pleasant shade to the pa- 
tients. 

The ground slopes gently toward the south arid east. A slug- 
gish stream of water flows through the southern portion of the 
hospital grounds from west to east. The upper portion of this 
stream is used by the patients for washing their clothes, whilst along 
the borders of the lower portions logs have been ranged upon which 
the patients may sit and evacuate their bowels. This part of the 
stream was a semi-fluid mass of human excrements, offal, and filth 
of all kinds. 

This immense cesspool, fermenting beneath the hot sun, emitted 
an overpowering stench. 

The banks of this stream south of the hospital inclosure are 
bordered by a swamp which spreads out toward the southeast. 
This swamp is well covered by forest trees, usual in southern 
swamps, as the small magnolia, red bay, sweet gums, black gum, 
tupelo, tulip-tree, red maple, ash, and beech. 

North of the hospital grounds, the stream which flows through 
the Stockade pursues its sluggish and filthy course. The exhala- 
tions from this swamp, which is loaded with the excrements of the 
prisoners confined in the Stockade, exert their deleterious influ- 
ences upon the inmates of the Hospital. 

The entire grounds are surrounded by a frail board fence, and 
are strictly guarded by Confederate soldiers, and no prisoner, ex- 
cept the paroled attendants, is allowed to leave the grounds except 
by a special permit from the commandant of the interior of the 
prison. 



520 DEFECTIVE POLICE AND HYGIENE. 

The patients and attendants, near two thousand in number, are 
Number of crowded iuto this confined space, and are but poorly sup- 
^tendaats! pHcd with old and ragged tents. Large numbers of them 
were without any bunks, and lay upon the ground, ofttimes with- 
out even a blanket — no beds or straw appear to have been fur- 
nished. 

The tents extend to within a few yards of the small stream, the 
eastern portion of which, as we have before said, was used as a 
privy, and was loaded with excrements ; and I observed a large 
pile of corn-bread, bones, and filth of all kinds, thirty feet in diam- 
eter and several feet in height, swarming with myriads of flies, in a 
vacant space near the pots used for cooking. 

Millions of flies swarmed over eveiy thing, and covered the 
Great num- ^ces of the sleeping patients, and crawled down their 
andmfg-^ opon mouths and deposited their maggots in the gan- 
gots. grenous wounds of the living and in the mouths of the 

dead. Myriads of mosquitoes also infested the tents, and many 
of the patients were so stung by these pestiferous insects that they 
appeared as if they were suffering from a slight attack of measles. 

The police and hygiene of the hospital was defective in the ex- 
Poiice and trcmc ; as the attendants were selected fi'om the prisoners, 
hospital. they not only robbed the sick of their clothing and ra- 
tions, but also neglected their comfort and cleanliness in a most 
shameful manner. The sick were literally incrusted with dirt and 
covered with vermin. 

When a gangrenous wound needed washing, the limb was thrust 
Dressing of ^^^ ^ ^i^tlc from the blanket or board or rags upon which 
Majgots'in ^^^ paticut was tying, and water poured over it, and all 
wounds, etc. ^^^ putresccut matters allowed to soak into the ground 
floor of the tent. 

The supply of rags for dressing wounds was said to be very 
scant ; and I saw the most filthy rags, which had been applied sev- 
eral times and imperfectly washed, used in dressing recent wounds. 
When hospital gangrene was prevailing it was impossible for any 
wound to escape contagion under these circumstances. 

I saw several gangrenous wounds filled with maggots. The 
numerous flies which swarmed around and over every ulcer, with- 
out doubt formed efficient agents for the spread of hospital gan- 
grene. 

The results of the treatment of wounds in the hospital were of 
the most unsatisfactory character, from the neglect of cleanliness in 
the dressings and wounds themselves, as well as from various other 
causes which will be more fullv considered. 



MANNER OF DISPOSING OF THE DEAD. 521 

I have frequently seen neglected wounds amongst the Confed- 
erate soldiers filled with maggots, as in the case of some of these 
wounds and ulcers ; and as far as my experience extends, these 
worms destroy only the dead tissues, and do not injure specially the 
well parts. I have even heard surgeons affirm that a gangrenous 
wound which has been thoroughly cleansed by maggots heals more 
rapidly than if it had been left to itself. 

This want of cleanliness on the part of the nurses appeared to 
be the result of carelessness and inattention rather than Abuses 
of malignant design, and the whole trouble can be traced absence of 

, ° P T T T . 1 . system and 

to the want or the proper police and sanitary regulations, discipline, 
and to the absence of intelligent organization and division of labor. 
The abuses were in a large measure due to the almost total ab- 
sence of system and government, and of rigid but wholesome sani- 
tary regulations. 

In extenuation of these abuses it was alleged by the medical 
officers that the Confederate troops were barely sufficient to guard 
the prisoners, and that it was impossible to obtain any number of 
experienced nurses from the Confederate forces. In fact the guard 
appeared to be too small even for the regulation of the internal hy- 
giene and police of the hospital. 

The manner of disposing of the dead was also calculated to de- 
press the already desponding spirits of these men, many Manner of 
of whom had been confined for months, and even for near the dead. 
two years, in Richmond and other places, and whose strength had 
been wasted by bad air, bad food, and neglect of personal cleanli- 
ness. The dead-house is merely a frame covered with old tent- 
cloths and a few brushes, situated in the southwestern corner of the 
hospital grounds. When a patient dies, he is simply laid in the 
narrow street in front of his tent, until he is removed by Federal 
negroes detailed to carry off the dead. If a patient dies during 
the night, he lies there until the morning, and during the day even 
the dead were frequently allowed to remain for hours in these 
walks. In the dead-house the corpses lie upon the bare ground, and 
were in most cases covered with filth, vermin, and flies, and their 
distended and open mouths were frequently filled with maggots be- 
fore burial. During the night of September 17th, there had fallen 
quite a shower of rain. Whilst walking next morning in the lanes 
between the closely clustered tents, filled each with from four to 
eight patients, I was startled at seeing a bold full-length figure of a 
man upon the smooth, well-beaten ground of the street. There 
was the well-defined nose, open mouth, and flowing beard in strong

profile. It looked as if an exact daguerreotype of the man had 
been taken upon the filthy soil, saturated with urine and the wash- 
ings of the food. The impression was life-like in all its propor- 
tions, and was of a much darker color than the surrounding soil. 
Upon inquiry I found that the dead, as was the usual custom, had 
been removed out of the tent, and had remained there during the 
night. The descending rain washed off the filth from the clothes 
and body, and the carbon deposited from the smoke of the pine 
wood used in cooking. From each point of the body, and the 
scant covering of clothing, poured a stream of black filth, which 
painted the body full-length upon the ground. I observed similar 
impressions wherever a dead body had lain during the night. 

At short intervals, in the lanes between the tents, wooden boxes 
Receptacles are arranged for the reception of the excrements of those 

for excre- . . ^ , i • i i 

ments. paticuts who are unable to go to the smks over the stream. 

These are not emptied until tliey are filled with excrements. At 
all times the emaciated men, worn down to skeletons by diarrhoea 
and dysentery, are seen evacuating their bowels into these filthy re- 
ceptacles, which from their wooden structure can never be kept 
properly cleansed. Notwithstanding these objectionable arrange- 
ments, the surgeons, from the limited resources of the purveying 
department of the Confederate States, appear to be unable to de- 
vise any better mode of collecting and removing the excrements 
of the sick. Metallic or earthenware vessels would be far prefer- 
able, but it is said that they cannot be obtained at the present 
time. 

Time and again I saw patients who apparently had ample strength 
to walk to the sinks evacuate their bladders within the tent doors. 
The whole soil appeared to be saturated with urine and filth of all 
kinds, and emitted a most disgusting odor. 

The cooking arrangements were of the most miserable and de- 
Cooking ar- fcctive character. Two large iron pots, similar to those 
rangements. ^g^^ £^j. |)oiiij^g sugar-cauc, wcrc the ouly cooking uten- 
sils furnished by the hospital for the cooking of near two thousand 
men ; and the patients were dependent in great measure upon 
their own miserable utensils. They were allow^ed to cook in the 
tent doors and in the lanes, and this w^as another source of filth 
and another favorable condition for the generation of flies and 
other vermin. 

The air of the tents was foul and disagreeable in the extreme, 
Foul air of Miul iu fact the entire grounds emitted a most nauseous

FOOD ISSUED TO THE SICK.

entered nearly all the tents, and carefully examined the cases 
of interest, and especially the cases of gangrene, upon numerous 
occasions during tlie prosecution of my pathological inquiries in 
Anderson ville, and therefore enjoyed every opportunity to judge 
correctly of the hygiene and police of the hospital. 

There appeared to be an almost absolute neglect on the part of 
the patients of personal cleanliness. The clothing of the Neglect of 
patients in most instances, and especially of those suffer- ^^eaniiness. 
ing from gangrene and phagedenic scorbutic ulcers, was filthy in 
the extreme, and ofttimes covered with vermin. 

The patients were, as a general rule, received in a most deplora- 
ble condition from the Stockade. I have seen men brought condition of 
into the hospital grounds from the Stockade in a dying when receiv- 
condition, begrimed from head to foot with excrements, stockade. 
and so black from smoke and filth that they resembled negroes 
rather than white men. 

The food issued to the sick in the hospital was no great improve- 
ment over that issued to the prisoners in the Stockade, j-ood issued 
and consisted of corn-bread, rice, bacon, and beef, with *<^t^esick. 
occasional supplies of green pease, molasses, and vinegar.

large as they appear to be, are far below the truth. 

As the number of prisoners varied greatly at different periods, 
the relations between those reported sick and well, as far as these

532 EXPLANATION OF INCREASE OF MORTALITY. 

During this period of six months no less than five hundred and 
Explanation sixtj-fivc deaths are recorded under the head of moi'hi 
number of varU, In other words, these men died without having 
morbi varii. received sufficient medical attention for the determination 
of even the name of the disease causing death. 

During the month of August, fifty-three cases and fifty-three 
Deaths re- dcaths are recorded marasmus. Surely this large num- 
marasmus. bcr of dcaths must have been due to some morbid state 
other than slow wasting. If these deaths were due to improper or 
insufficient food, they should have been classed accordingly, and if 
to diarrhoea or dysentery or scurvy, their classification would in like 
manner have been comparatively simple. 

Progressive ^^ obscrvo a progrcssivc increase of the rate of mor- 
Jhe'rat'^of t^Hty from 3.77 per cent, in March to 9.09 per cent, of 
mortauty. mean strength sick and well in August. 

The ratio of mortality continued to increase during September, 
for notwithstanding the removal of one half the entire number of 
prisoners during the early portion of this month, one thousand 
seven hundred and sixty-seven (1767) deaths were registered fii-ora 
September 1st to 21st, and the largest number of deaths ever 
recorded occurred during this month on the 16th, namely, one 
hundred and nineteen. 

The entire number of Federal prisoners confined at Anderson- 
Duringseven ^'^^^^ ^^^ about 40,611 ; and during the period of near 
S'y one scvcu mouths, from February 24th to September 21st, 
pSnerl*^' 9479 dcatlis were recorded ; that is, during this period 
^^^' near one fourth, or more exactly one in 4.2, or 23.3 per 

cent., terminated fatally. 

The progressive increase of mortality was due in great measure 

Explanation to the accumulatiou of the sources of disease, as the in- 

gressive in- crcasc of cxcrcmcnts and filth of all kinds, and the con- 
crease of • p • m • 1 1 1 

mortality. ccutratiou 01 uoxious eiiluvia, and also to the progressive 
effects of the bad diet, crowding, and hot climate. 

Surrounded by these depressing agencies, the postponement of 
the general exchange of prisoners and the constantly receding 
hopes of deliverance through the action of their own government 
depressed the already desponding spirits, and destroyed those men- 
tal and moral energies so necessary for the successful struggle 
against the active agents of disease. 

Home-sickness, and the disappointment, mental depression, and 
distress attending the daily longings for an apparently hopeless 
release, appeared to be as potent agencies in the destruction of 
these prisoners as the physical causes of actual disease. 



If: 



DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF RELIEF. 533 

gigantic mass of human suffering calls loudly for relief, 
t only for its own sake and the cause of humanity, but Appeal for 
also on account of the brave Confederate soldiers now '"^^'®^- 
ptives in the hands of the Federal Government. 
In presuming to step aside, for one mohient, from the line of 
abor indicated in the Surgeon-General's order, and to Difficulties in 
volunteer sus^estions with reference to the amelioration relief. 

C5c5 

of suffering and the rectification of abuses, I am well aware that 
the same principles of enlarged humanity which the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral has ever displayed in the management of the medical depart- 
ment in its varied and difficult relations, as well to the Federal 
prisoners as to the Confederate armies, actuates the chief executive 
as well as all the high officers of the government charged with the 
general direction of such matters ; and that no effort has been spared 
by the Confederate authorities, through Colonel Robert Ould, Agent 
of Exchange, to effect a complete and speedy exchange of Federal 
prisoners in their hands. As long as the Confederate government 
is compelled to hold these prisoners as hostages for the safe return 
and exchange of the captive men of its own armies, it is difficult to 
devise efficient measures for the mitigation of much of the suffer- 
ing of such an immense army of prisoners (equal at least to one 
fourth of the Confederate forces actively engaged in the field, east 
of the Mississippi), in a purely agricultural and sparsely settled 
country, with imperfect lines of communication, with but few man- 
ufactories, without commerce, cut off from all communication with 
the surrounding world, deprived of even the necessary medicines 
which have been declared by its enemies " contraband of war," 
with torn and bleeding borders, with progressively diminishing 
powers of subsistence and resistance, with its entire fighting popu- 
lation in arms, and yet being steadily driven back and overpowered 
by the hosts of the enemy, with a constant driving in of the popu- 
lation from the constantly contracting borders upon the overcrowded 
and distressed centre, and with a corresponding increase of travel 
upon the dilapidated railroads, already taxed far beyond their 
capacity with the transportation of troops, the munitions of war, 
and the sick and wounded. In Georgia, especially, the very State 
in w^hich these prisoners are confined, is the pressure of the Con- 
federate disasters felt with daily increasing force. The disastrous 
campaign in Northern Georgia has been attended with the desola- 
tion of the fairest portions of the State. Thousands of families 
from the devastated regions, and from all the towns and villages 
from Chattanooga to Atlanta and beyond, have fled to the regions 



534 COKDITIONS ESSENTIAL TO RELIEF. 

considered more safe from invasion, and are occupying old cars, 
depots, sheds, and tents along the entire railroad system of Georgia. 
Thousands of old men, delicate women, and defenseless children, 
have not only lost all their earthly possessions, but are without a 
roof to cover their heads, and are dependent for their daily bread 
upon the charities of the State government. The hospitals attached 
to the army of Tennessee are in a constant state of motion, and the 
poorly fed and imperfectly treated wounded are suffering with the 
worst forms of hospital gangrene and pyaemia. Every available 
building, including churches and colleges and school-houses, suitable 
for hospital purposes, in all the towns and villages, are crowded with 
the sick and wounded, and Georgia may with truth be said to be 
one vast hospital. 

It is therefore with a sincere appreciation of the great difficulties 
of the situation that I respectfully present for the consideration of 
the Surgeon-General the conditions which I believe to be essential 
to the relief of these suffering prisoners. 

1st. Such an increase of the Confederate guard as will allow of 
Conditions ^^^ enlargement and proper police of the Military Prison 
Sf sug-° and Hospital. The average area to each prisoner should 
gested. ijg increased at least fivefold. The guard should be suf- 

ficiently strong within the prison to compel the prisoners to observe 
strict hygienic rules, not only with reference to the deposition and 
removal of fecal matters and filth of all kinds, but also with refer- 
ence to personal cleanliness by frequent ablutions. The experience 
at this place demonstrates that the enforcement of proper hygienic 
rules must depend upon a regularly appointed and accountable 
guard, and not upon the prisoners. The removal of large num- 
bers of the Federal prisoners to Millen, Savannah, Charleston, and 
other points will, without doubt, tend to better the hygienic condi- 
tion of the prisoners for a time at least ; but it is evident that if 
no system of police be established within the new prisons, then 
matters will gradually assume the same deplorable condition as at 
this place. 

2d. The construction of suitable barracks and hospital buildings. 
These have been projected and commenced, but the work should 
be hurried to a completion before cold weather. 

3d. The increase of the medical staff, and the appointment of 
one or more chaplains. 

4th. The appointment of disabled Confederate soldiers as nurses, 
ward-masters, and apothecaries ; many of these men who are in- 
capable of performing active service in the field possess the neces- 



SAOTTARY REPORTS. 535 

sary intelligence and physical ability to act as hospital attendants, 
and also to enforce the necessary sanitary regulations. 

i^ft 5th. The gi^eat prevalence of scurvy demands that liberal sup- 
^Pies of fresh vegetables, sweet potatoes, and fresh milk should be 
issued. If the sour oranges of Florida and of the southern sea- 
coast could be obtained, they would produce the best results in the 
treatment of scurvy. 
I^H I consider an abundant and regular supply of fresh milk as also 
^^sential to the treatment of chronic dian'hoea and dysentery, which 
are prevailing to so great an extent, and which appear to be en- 
tirely beyond control under the present mode of treatment and 
diet. I suggested to the Surgeon in charge of the Prison Hospital 
the propriety of purchasing a number of cows for the use of the 
sick. 

That the precedhig description of the Stockade and Prison Hospi- 
tal at Anderson ville has not been overdrawn, will appear hospital 
from the following inspection and sanitary reports, which "^p**"^**- 
were accurately copied under my direction and supervision from 
the originals, on file in the office of the chief surgeon of the post, 
by my faithful secretary, Mr. Louis Manigault. 

C. S. Military Pkison, Andersonville, ) 
Chief Surgeon's Office, April 25th, 1864. ) 

General, — I have the honor to report that the total number of pa- 
tients treated up to date is two thousand six hundred and Report of 
ninety-seven, with seven hundred and eighteen deaths. The ge^on^wwte 
large ratio of mortality is due to the debilitated condition in 5?^^^)!^ 
which many of the prisoners were when admitted into the Wright. 
prison — having been confined for a long time in other prisons — and 
to the absence of proper hospital accommodation, the construction of 
which has been prevented by the difficulty experienced in obtaining 
lumber ; and small-pox was introduced into the prison by prisoners 
sent from Richmond, Va. Vaccination has been resorted to, the dis- 
ease has not spread to any extent, and is now on the decline. 

The sick are treated in tents, of which there is an inadequate 
supply. 

The present location of the hospital is objectionable for the following 
reasons : The drainage of the sinks of the prison passes through the 
hospital grounds. The contiguity to the prisoners will disseminate dis- 
ease amongst them. The hospital being within the Stockade, hospital 
bedding and diet and other supplies for the comfort of the sick and 
wounded are stolen by the prisoners, and the impossibility of keeping 
them out of the hospital is a source of annoyance to the sick. 

I therefore most respectfully suggest that the hospital be placed out-

to the purpose.

Moore. j^^ reply, I have the honor to state that the evil has been 

remedied, and the condition of the camp at the time of the report was 
no fault of the commanding officer, but was due to the great difficulty 
experienced in obtaining shovels and other things requisite. Your honor 
should be informed that the prison is located in a section barren of re- 
sources, and great difficulty is experienced in obtaining the necessary 
appliances for its proper organization, and a large number of prisoners 
arrived before its completion. 

I take pleasure in stating that the commanding officer, and the chief 
of each staff department, are using every effijrt to effect a thorough or- 
ganization. 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SANITARY REPORT. 
Sanitary re- ^^ compHancc with regulations, I have the honor to make 
Surgeon '"'^^^ the following Report of the Sanitary Condition of the C. S. 
White. Military Prison at Andersonville. 

There is nothing in the topography of the country that can be said 
to have influenced the health of the command. The location is elevated 
and well drained. The soil is sandy, without vegetable mould or other 
cryptogamous growth likely to engender malaria. The large ratio of 
diseases of the digestive system has been due to long confinement in 
prison, with the diet. I am convinced from observation that a majority 
of the cases of diarrhoea and dysentery have more or less scorbutic 
connection. 

The bakery and other culinary arrangements have just been com- 
pleted, up to which time there had been an inadequate supply of cook- 
ing utensils, and in consequence thereof the articles of diet have been 
insufficiently cooked. 

The ration is the same as that issued to the Confederate soldiers in 
the field, namely : beef, one pound, or in lieu, one third pound bacon ; 



SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 537 

corn meal, one and a quarter pounds, with an occasional issue of rice, 
beans, molasses, and vinegar. 
^^■The arrangements for a thorough policing of the Prison are not yet 
'^nished. Through the centre of the Stockade passes a stream affording 
an amply supply of good water. At the upper end of the prison it is 
designed to construct two dams of different heights ; the upper to be 
used for drinking, the lower for bathing ; over the remainder of the 
stream, are to be arranged the sinks. The stream has sufficient volume 
and velocity to carry off all ordure. Once a day the flood-gates of the 
dams mentioned above are to be opened, thereby driving off all deposits 
that may have collected during the day. 

At present the police of the camp is defective, but the commander of 
the interior is using every effort to effect the arrangement mentioned 
above, which has been retarded up to the present time by an inadequate 
supply of the necessary tools. The habits of the men, as a rule, are 
filthy in the extreme, and as soon as the arrangements for bathing have 
been completed, it will be necessary to compel them to bathe at stated 
periods. 

The dimensions of the prison will not admit of exercise, the absence 
of which, with the depressing influences on the mind, produced by im- 
prisonment, is a prolific source of disease. 

The large ratio of mortality is due to the debilitated condition of the 
prisoners, produced by long confinement in prison, and to absence of 
proper hospital accommodations. The worst cases are treated in tents, 
of which there is an inadequate supply. The present location of the 
hospital is objectionable for the following reasons : The prisoners with 
their camp-fires are densely crowded around the hospital, preventing a 
free circulation of air so necessary to the treatment of the class of dis- 
eases prevailing. The mistaken kindness of their comrades who visit 
them, and furnish them improper diet, produces deleterious conse- 
quences. It is to be admitted, however, that such instances are rare, 
and in many instances assistance is refused to dying comrades in the 
same tent. In consequence of the predatory forays upon the hospital, by 
which the sick are robbed of their blankets, clothes, and diet, it will be 
impossible to furnish the hospital with proper bedding and diet while 
the hospital remains within the Stockade. The drainage from the prison 
passing through the hospital grounds is another great objection to its 
location. I therefore most respectfully suggest that authority be granted 
to place the hospital outside the Stockade, and that an adequate supply 
of tents be furnished until proper hospitals can be constructed. 

ISAIAH H. WHITE, 
May 6//i, 1864. Chief Surgeon. 

Captain, — I have the honor to submit the following report of the 
sanitary condition of the C. S. Military Prison, at Anderson- Report of 

... jf J ' Chief Sur-

The prison is situated on two opposing banks of a stream, boJIq.^^'^

which furnishes an ample supply of good water for drinking and bathing 
purposes. The location is elevated and well drained. The soil is sandy, 
without vegetable mould, or other cryptogamous growth likely to engen- 
der malaria. 

The prisoners are not supplied with barracks or tents, but most of them 
have provided themselves with little huts made of boughs, thus making 
themselves comparatively comfortable. This, however, will be insuffi- 
cient during the extremely hot weather of the summer months. There 
being no trees, or other protection from the rays of the sun, and crowded 
together as they are, it will be necessary to furnish them with tents, or 
other more capacious quarters than those now occupied, in order that 
they may be divided off into proper streets admitting free circulation 
of air and the enforcing of the necessary police regulations. 

At the upper end of the stream it is designed to construct two dams 
of different altitudes, the upper for drinking, and the lower for bath- 
ing purposes ; over the remainder of the stream, it is designed to con- 
struct the sinks. The stream is of sufficient volume and velocity to 
carry off all ordure. 

The number of cases treated from the foundation of the prison, up to 
date, has been 4588, with 1026 deaths. The number reported sick and 
wounded for the month of April, exhibits a ratio of 316.1 cases, and 
57.6 deaths per 1000 of mean strength. 

Amongst the first prisoners admitted, there was a large ratio of dis- 
eases of the respiratory system, contracted in transit from Richmond 
during very cold weather, and the majority of which resulted fatally, in 
consequence of the absence of barracks and hospital accommodations, 
and the emaciated condition of the subjects, due to long confinement 
in prison. 

The diseases now prevailing are chiefly those of the digestive sys- 
tem, diarrhoea and dysentery, which have in most instances a scorbutic 
connection. 

The rations of the prisoners are the same as those issued to Confeder- 
ate soldiers in the field, namely : one pound beef, or in lieu, three quar- 
ters pound bacon, one and a quarter pounds meal, with an occasional 
issue of beans, rice, molasses, and vinegar. The bakery and other 
culinary arrangements have just been completed, and rations are now 
issued cooked. Up to this time, there has been an inadequate supply 
of cooking utensils, in consequence of which the food was improperly 
prepared, and increased the number of cases of diarrhoea and dysen- 
tery. 

The ratio of mortality is due to the lack of vitality in the subjects, 
produced by long confinement in prison, with its depressing influences 
on the mind. The remedies employed are unassisted by the vis medi- 
catrix naturce, without which remedial agencies are powerless. It is also 
impossible to treat diseases with success, with the present hospital ac- 



SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 539 

imodations. The patients are now treated in tent flies, of which there 
is an inadequate supply. The location of the hospital is also objection- 
able. The prisoners, with their camp fires, are densely crowded around 
the hospital, producing contaminating effluvia and preventing the free 
circulation of air, so necessary to the treatment of disease. In conse- 
quence of the forays upon the hospital, by the prisoners, it is impossible 
to supply the sick with proper comforts. The drainage from the sinks 
of the prison passing through the hospital grounds, is another objection 
to its location. I therefore most respectfully suggest, that authority be 
granted to place the hospital outside of the Stockade, and that an ade- 
quate supply of tents to accommodate one thousand sick, be immediately 
furnished. 

Respectfully submitted,

Sir, — I have the honor to submit the following report of the sani- 
tary condition of C. S. Prison at Andersonville, Ga. : — 

Your inspection of the Prison has, no doubt, convinced you cwe/sur- 
of the too crowded condition of the prisoners within the on^thrSS- 
Stockade, which, combined with the absence of barrack accom- JfJ^^f "Je 
modation, is a prolific source of disease. jpnaon of

The arrangements for the enforcing of proper regulations viiie, to 
for cleanliness of the camp are in progress. Hammond. 

The hospital up to the 2 2d ultimo, was located within the Stockade, 
where it was impossible to provide the sick with the necessary comforts. 
The supply of tents has never been adequate to accommodate the num- 
ber of sick. The present site of the hospital affords a fine shade, and 
a good supply of water for drinking and cleanliness. The area is a 
parallelogram, whose sides are two hundred and sixty and three hun- 
dred and forty feet There are two hundred and nine tents of all kinds, 
the majority of which are small picket tents, and tent flies, illy adapted 
to hospital purposes. The capacity consistent with comfort, does not 
exceed eight hundred men ; but in consequence of an inadequate sup- 
ply, they have been compelled to accommodate one thousand and twenty 
of the worst cases. They are now so crowded as to render it necessary 
to refuse admission to many cases which cannot be treated with success 
in the kind of quarters occupied by inmates of the Prison. Two hun- 
dred hospital tents are required to acconnnodate the present and daily 
increasing number of sick. Delay in obtaining medical supplies fre- 
quently arises, in consequence of the requisitions being required to be 
sent to Medical Director of Hospitals at Atlanta, for approval, whilst the 
supplies are drawn from Macon, Ga., only sixty miles distant. I would 



540 SANITARY KEPORTS OF SURGEON" WHITE. 

suggest, for the consideration of the proper authority, the propriety of 
permitting the medical purveyor at Macon to issue on requisition of the 
chief surgeon of the post, approved by the commanding officer. The 
supply of medicines is not at all times equal to the demand, being issued 
in quantities much less than is allowed by the supply table. The de- 
ficiencies which occur, cannot be promptly met in consequence of the 
delay which arises from sending requisitions to Atlanta for approval, 
and awaiting their return. 

The report of sick and wounded for the month of April, exhibits a 
ratio per one thousand (1000) of mean strength, three hundred and six 
and one tenth cases treated, and fifty-seven and six tenths deaths. 
May, six hundred and forty and thirty-three one hundreths cases treated, 
and forty-seven and three tenths deaths. The daily ratio per one thou- 
sand of mean strength, for the twenty days of present month, has been 
one and five sevenths deaths, which, taken as an average for the thirty 
days, would make fifty-one and four tenths deaths per one thousand of 
mean strength for month of June. 

The morning report of C. S. Prison shows remaining in hospital one 
thousand and twenty-two ; in quarters, two thousand six hundred and 
sixty-five ; deaths, forty ; strength of command, twenty-three thousand 
nine hundred and eleven. 

The number of medical officers on duty at the prison is inadequate to 
perform the duties required of them. There are in all twelve, seven of 
whom attend sick-call, and five on duty at hospital. Of the entire num- 
ber, five are employed by contract. I would suggest that the medical 
force be increased by ten additional officers. 

Respectfully submitted, 

ISAIAH H. WHITE, 
Captain Hammond. Chief Surgeon. 

SAXITARY REPORT C. S. MILITARY PRISON HOSPITAL, AXDERSON- 
VILLE, GEORGIA. 

There is nothing in the topography of the country that can be said to 
Sanitary ^^vc influenced the health of the command, except, perhaps, 
S?sur- ^^ ^■^^ immediate camp, through which passes a stream of 
geon White, water, the margins of which are low and swampy, and have 
been recently drained with a view of reclaiming them sufficiently for 
camping piu'poses, the result of which has been to expose to the rays of 
the summer's sun a large surface covered with decaying vegetable mat- 
ter, a condition favorable to the production of malarious diseases. This 
surface is now being covered with dry sand. With this exception, the 
land is high and well drained, and the soil light and sandy. 

The prisoners being from the United States, have been influenced as 
much, perhaps, by the climate as any other agency. The prison was 
built to accommodate ten thousand (10,000) prisoners, in which have 
unavoidably been placed, over twenty-six thousand (26,000), causing 



SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 541 

lem to become so crowded as to prevent a proper circulation and due 
allowance of atmospheric air. With this crowded condition there is an 
absence of barracks or tents ; the only protection from the weather 
being little huts made of boughs, blankets, and small picket tents, used 
in the U. S. army, which being irregularly arranged, obstruct the free 
circulation of air. Within the last few days, the Stockade has been in- 
creased ten acres, relieving the crowded condition heretofore existing. 
Barracks are also being constructed ; it however is an immense task, 
and will not soon be completed. 

The diet of the prisoners is the same as that issued to Confederate 
soldiers in the field, namely : one pound beef, or one third pound bacon, 
one and a quarter pounds meal, with an occasional issue of beans and 
rice. 

There is a great lack of cleanliness on the part of the prisoners. The 
chief cause of disease and mortality is long confinement in prison, 
which in connection with the diet (having produced scurvy among them), 
has so lowered their vitality as to render them unable to resist disease. 
The hospital in the early part of the quarter being situated within the 
Stockade, it was impossible to supply the sick with the necessary com- 
forts ; hospital bedding, diet, etc., being stolen from the hospital by the 
prisoners. In the latter part of the month of May, authority was 
granted to move the hospital without the Stockade. The condition of 
the sick has been much improved by the change. They are now treated 
in a hospital camp, well supplied with shade and water. The tents are, 
for the most part, small and illy adapted to hospital purposes, and in- 
sufficient in number to accommodate the large number of sick to be 
treated. The tents are all filled to excess, and many men are refused 
admission to hospital for want of room. 

During the quarter, the Prison has been, on several occasions, without 
any medicines whatever. Requisitions are made for one month's sup- 
ply, which are filled in such diminished quantities as to create the 
necessity for other requisitions during the month. These have to go to 
Atlanta for approval ; in consequence of the irregularity of the mail, 
they do not return frequently under eight or ten days ; they have then 
to be sent to medical purveyor at Macon, where they are usually filled 
with promptness : but before they are received, one half the period 
drawn for has elapsed, and the former supply is exhausted. 

The number of medical officers on duty at the Prison, is inadequate 
to perform the required duties. There are over twenty-six thousand 
(26,000) prisoners, with only thirteen (13) medical officers ; of this 
number, five attend the hospital, where there are eleven hundred and 
thirty-four (1134) sick.

542 SANITAKY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 



Headquarteks, Post Andersonville, Ga., ) 
Med. Department, June 26<A, 1864. | 

Sir, — I have just established a hospital for the troops on duty at this 
cweTsur- P^^*' ^^ accommodate one hundred sick, and have assigned 
geon White Assistaut-Surgeon W. B. Harrison in charge. Be pleased to 
Beemis, act- instruct me through what channel medical officers serving 

ing director . , , i • i i • 

Of hospitals. With the troops domg duty at this post are to report. 

On the removal of the hospital from the Stockade, I informed you 
what accommodation I had made for the sick. The strength of the 
command having increased to twenty-five thousand men, more than 
double that for which hospital accommodations were prepared, the hos- 
pital is now filled far beyond its healthy capacity. I have tents of all 
kinds to accommodate eight hundred men, in which I have been com- 
pelled to crowd over twelve hundred, being unable to procure others. 
General Winder, commanding post, has telegraphed to Richmond, to 
see if we can obtain the tents that were occupied by the prisoners on 
Belle-Isle, at Richmond, Va. ; if successful, it will take some weeks for 
them to reach here. For humanity's sake, please assist me in obtaining 
two hundred tents at once. There are nearly three thousand (3000) 
sick in the Prison, many of whom require hospital treatment, which 
cannot be furnished because of the already crowded condition of the 
hospital. It is impossible to get tents from the quartermaster in this 
department. 

The number of medical officers on duty here is utterly inadequate to 
perform the duties required of them. There are one thousand and 
thirty-five patients in hospital, with only five medical officers, only eight 
to attend sick-call at the prison, with a command of twenty-five thou- 
sand men, daily increasing. Please assign one or more good surgeons, 
that I can place in charge of the different divisions of the prison hos- 
pital. 

The direct contact with which the surgeon in charge of the prison 
hospital is brought with the commandant of the interior of the prison 
would produce incalculable discord and confusion if he were not willing 
to cooperate, and forego many things that would be desired for the 
proper arrangement of a hospital. I hope you will consider these 
things in making the assignment. Send a man of sufficient intelligence 
and zeal for the cause, to duly appreciate all the disadvantages to be 
encountered. 

Surgeon Stout's communication of the 7th inst, in relation to recom- 
mending competent private physicians for contract has been received. 
Being an entire stranger here, I have no one to recommend. It seems 
impossible to obtain any one exempt from military service ; almost any 
employment being more lucrative. I am aware that the recent opera- 
tions of the army have created a great demand for medical officers in

P. Moore, Surgeon-General, C. S. A.: — 

Sir, — I am instructed by the general commanding, to represent that 
inconvenience and delay arise in obtaining medical and hos- ^^*7g^j, 
pital supplies, in consequence of requisitions being required geo^ ^^'"te 
to be sent to Surgeon Stout, Medical Director of Hospitals at Gen. Moore. 
Atlanta, Ga., for approval. In consequence of the irregularity of the 
mails, eight or ten days frequently elapse before the requisition with ap- 
proval returns to this office, which has then to be sent to the medical 
purveyor at Macon. Before the medicines arrive here, two weeks (or 
one half the period for which requisition is made) have elapsed, creating 
a scarcity, and in some instances an entire lack of medicines. 

In addition to prisoners, of which there are twenty-six thousand three 
hundred and sixty-seven (26,367), the command consists of five regi- 
ments, and one company of artillery as guard. I am informed by Sur- 
geon Stout, that medical officers on duty with these regiments do not 
report through him. Brigadier- General John H. Winder, commanding 
post, reports directly to Secretary of War, this not being considered a 
part of any military department in this State. If compatible with the 
interests of the service, I most respectfully request that I be permitted 
to report directly to the Surgeon-General, and that the medical pur- 
veyor at Macon, Ga., be instructed to issue to this post on requisition 
with my approval.

Owing to insufficient hospital accommodations, many are treated 
in quarters who should be in hospital. The present capacity of the 
hospital is for one thousand four hundred sick. The hospital is situ- 
ated in an oak grove, affording good shade. Through the prison passes 
a stream of water, furnishing an ample supply of water for cleanliness. 
Drinking water is obtained of good quality from wells and springs on 
the banks of the stream. 

The tents are insufficient in number, and not of proper size for the 
treatment of sick. Most of them are the small fly tent and tent flies. 
There should be at least two hundred or five hundred wall-tents to 
properly accommodate the sick. 

It has been impossible up to this time to obtain straw for bedding, 
this not being a grain-growing district. Small crops of wheat have 
been raised this year, and efforts are being made to collect a sufficient 
quantity as soon as the present crop is threshed. But there is a lack of 
transportation at the post, and farmers are unwilling to hire their own 
teams for the purpose. 

The attendants are paroled prisoners, who as a rule are faithful in the 
performance of their duty, being actuated by the improvement of their 
own condition on removal from the Stockade, and a fear of a return, if 
negligent in the performance of duty, apart from a desire to serve their 
OAvn sick comrades. 

The number of medical officers, until the recent call of the militia by 
the Governor of Georgia, was utterly inadequate ; since that time a num- 
ber of physicians have been employed by contract, and others have been 
detailed by the Governor to serve in the medical department. These 
having been but recently assigned, it is impossible to decide upon their 
proficiency. The other medical officers, with a few exceptions, are ca- 
pable and attentive. The physicians which have been recently employed 
will no doubt cancel their contracts as soon as the militia is disbanded, 
and the services of the detailed physicians will also be lost. With this 
view, I would suggest that a sufficient number of competent medical 
officers be assigned. 

There is a deficiency of medical supplies issued by the Medical Pur- 



SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 

vcyor. Supplies of medicines have been occasionally entirely exhausted, 
and we have been left several days at a time without any whatever. 
This has arisen from the delay experienced in sending requisitions to 
the Medical Director at Atlanta for approval. 

The hospital ration is commuted as for other general hospitals, and 
supplies for the subsistence and comfort of sick are purchased with the 
hospital fund. Heretofore we have been able to supply the sick with 
vegetables, but during the entire month of July the commissary has been 
without funds, and difficulty has been experienced in purchasing on 
time. The ration issued to the prisoners is the same as that issued to 
Confederate soldiers in the field ; namely, one third pound pork, one 
and a quarter pounds meal, with an occasional issue of beans, rice, and 
molasses. The meal is issued unbolted, and when baked is coarse* and 
unwholesome. Amongst the old prisoners scurvy prevails to a great 
extent, which is usually accompanied by diseases of the digestive organs. 
This, in connection with the mental depression produced by long im- 
prisonment, is the chief cause of the mortality. 

There is nothing in the topography of the country that can be said to 
influence the health of the prison. The land is high and well drained, 
the soil light and sandy, with no marshes or other source of malaria in 
the vicinity. 

The densely crowded condition of the prisoners, with the innumerable 
little shelters irregularly arranged, precludes the enforcement of proper 
police, and prevents free circulation of air. 

The lack of barrack accommodation exposes the men to the heat 
of the sun during the day, and to the dews at night, and is a prolific 
source of disease. The margins of the stream passing through the 
Stockade are low and boggy, and having been recently drained, has ex- 
posed a large surface covered with vegetable mold to the rays of the 
sun, a condition favorable to the development of malarious diseases. 

It is the design of the commandant of the prison to cover the surface 
with dry sand, but the work has been unavoidably delayed. 

The absence of proper sinks and the filthy habits of the men have 
caused a deposit of fecal matter over almost the entire surface of this 
bottom land. The point of exit of the stream through the walls of the 
Stockade is not sufficiently bold to permit a free passage of ordure. 
When the stream is swollen by rains the lower portion of this bottom 
land is overflowed by a solution of excrement, which subsiding, and the 
surface becoming exposed to the sun, produces a horrible stench. Cap- 
tain Wirz, the commandant of the prison, has doubtless explained to 
you the difficulties which have prevented these with other projected im- 
provements in the way of bathing and other arrangements for cleanli- 
ness. 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

ISAIAH H. WHITE, 
To Colonel Chandler. Chief Surgeon of Post. 



546 SAKITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 

REPORT OF CHIEF SURGEON WHITE TO GENERAL WINDER ON THE 
SANITARY CONDITION OF THE MILITARY PRISON AT ANDERSONVILLE. 

Chief Surgeon's Office, ) 
ANDERSONVILLE, Ga., Auf/ust Qth, 1864. ) 

General, — I have the honor to submit the following report of the 
sanitary condition of the C. S. Military Prison : — 

I. Medical Topography of the Station. — The location is high and well 
drained ; the soil light and sandy. Near the Stockade, in a southward 
direction, is a creek whose margins are nmddy and boggy. Through 
the centre of the Stockade passes a smaller stream of similar character. 
The condition is favorable to the development of malarious diseases, but 
the report of the sick and wounded for the month of July exhibits a 
small ratio of this class of diseases. Out of ten thousand six hundred 
and twenty-one cases treated, only five hundred and five are of a mala- 
rious character. This cause appears to have acted more on the garrison 
than on the prisoners ; out of sixteen hundred and three cases treated, 
one hundred and forty-five malarious diseases are reported. 

II. T/ie Climate. — The climate is hot, and the prisoners coming from 
a much higher latitude have been influenced greatly by this agency. 

III. Nature of Barracks and Hospital Accommodations. — The pris- 
oners are without barracks or tents. Thirty thousand men being densely 
crowded together, sheltered only by blankets and low hovels densely and 
irregularly arranged, preventing free circulation, engendering foul and 
noxious vapors, and precluding any system of police ; the men are ex- 
posed during the day to the rays of the sun, and the dews at night, and 
many are unprotected during the rains. 

IV. The Hospital Accommodations are utterly inadequate to accom- 
modate the large number of sick. The hospital is located in a grove, 
on the banks of the creek, southeast of the Stockade. The site is the 
most eligible in the vicinity, with the present appliances. There is a 
great deficiency in the number of tents in which the sick are treated ; 
they are also too small for hospital purposes. A constant increase in 
the number of prisoners, and hence of the sick, has called for a con- 
tinued expansion of hospital accommodations. The hospital camp was 
first designed to accommodate one thousand sick, and was fitted up as 
best could be with the means at hand. Since that time the number of 
sick in hospital has increased to two thousand two hundred and eight, 
and three hundred and seventeen attendants ; total, two thousand five 
hundred and twenty five ; the result of which has been to place the 
hospital in a constant state of organization, and the efforts to make 
some provision for all have resulted in leaving all portions of the hospi- 
tal in an unfinished state. All the tents of the original camp have been 
filled with bunks ; at present the quartermaster cannot furnish plank to 
complete the others. It has been impossible to obtain straw for bed- 
ding, there being none in the country until the present crop. The 



p 



SANITAKY EEPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 547 



chief surgeon has made every effort to have it supplied. Until the 
number of sick became so large, pine straw was used for the purpose, 
but it being necessary to renew the supply once in two weeks (in conse- 
quence of vermin), it is impossible to obtain a sufficient quantity. It 
would require five wagons constantly employed to furnish an adequate 
supply. The chief surgeon has instructed the agent for the purchase of 
supplies, after subsistence or comfort of siqjjf, to purchase wheat straw 
and ship by railroad, the quartermaster having failed to supply us. 

V. Diet. — The ration consists of one third pound bacon, one and a 
quarter pounds meal. The meal is unbolted, and when baked, the bread 
is coarse and irritating, producing diseases of the organs of the digestive 
system (diarrhoea and dysentery). The absence of vegetable diet has 
produced scurvy to an alarming extent, especially amongst the old pris- 
oners. 

VI. Water. — The drinking water is obtained from springs settled on 
the banks of the stream and from wells, and to some extent from the 
stream. The water obtained from the stream is unfit for use, containing 
many impurities from the bakery and cook-house. Some of the camps 
of the garrison are situated on this stream, the surface drainage from 
which empties into this stream before passing through the Stockade. 
The supply from the springs near the stream is a little brackish, but 
better than the stream. A large number of wells have been dug in the 
prison, affording water of excellent quality. 

VII. Clothing. — Those who have been prisoners for a long time are 
badly supplied with clothing, and but few of them have a change, in 
consequence of which they are for the most part very filthy. 

VIII. General Habits of the Men as to Cleanliness. — With but few 
exceptions, they are very filthy as regards their person and clothing, and 
do not seem to appreciate the great necessity for bathing. 

IX. Police System of the Camp. — This is sadly defective. Amongst 
the very shelters, under their very noses, when asleep, faeces are depos- 
ited. The bottom land, through which the stream passes, is filthy 
beyond description. The character of the land is low and swampy ; a 
large surface covered with vegetable mould is exposed to the rays of the 
sun, a condition favorable to the development of malarious diseases. 
This appears to be the place where all who have not the energy and 
cleanliness to go beyond the camping ground defecate, until it has be- 
come a morass of human excrement. The place of exit of the stream 
beyond the Stockade is not sufficiently bold to permit a free efflux, and 
the fall of the stream beyond the Stockade is not great enough. When 
the stream is swollen by rains, the lower portion of this bottom land 
within the Stockade, and for some distance outside, is overflowed with a 
solution of human excrement, which subsiding, and becoming exposed 
to the sun, produces an intolerable stench, which, if not corrected before 
the fall months, will in all probability produce some epidemic form of 
disease increasing the already frightful mortality. 



548 SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 

X. Crowded Condition of the Prisoners. — The prison is filled far be- 
yond its healthy capacity. The number of prisoners should be reduced 
sufficiently to admit of their camps being regularly laid out, with streets 
of sufficient width to admit free circulation of air, and the enforcement 
of stringent police regulations. An area of sufficient size should be left 
for exercise. 

XI. Mental Depression. -^ Long confinement and hope deferred have 
produced with many of the prisoners a state of mental depression 
dreaded by the physician, even in civil practice, which, combined with 
the existing state of physical debility, renders them unable to resist 
disease. 

THE EVILS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE PROPER AUTHORITIES TO 

CORRECT. 

I. The Crowded Condition of the Prisoners. — The number within 
the Stockade should not exceed fifleen thousand. This would allow 
ample room for the remainder to be camped in order, with streets of 
sufficient width to allow free circulation of air, and enforcement of police 
regulations. All that portion of the camp on the north side of the 
stream could then be used for exercise, where roll-calls could also be 
held, thereby materially aiding the commandant of the interior. 

II. Construction of Barracks and Hospital Accommodatio7is. — There 
should be no delay in the construction of barracks ; with the greatest 
amount of energy it will be difficult to complete them before the cold 
weather comes on, when they will be required more than at present. 
Too great stress cannot be placed on the necessity for the construction 
of proper accommodations for the sick. There are at present two 
thousand two hundred and eight in hospital, all poorly provided for, and 
some three hundred without any shelter whatever. There are also at 
least one thousand men now in Stockade who are helpless, and should 
be at once removed to hospital. Their removal is prevented by the ab- 
sence of accommodations. The construction of hospitals should be at 
once begun, and in the mean time the sick should be at once transferred 
to some points where they can be properly provided for. An officer 
should be employed to arrange the stream passing through the Stockade. 
The bottom land should be covered over with sand, the stream be made 
deeper and wider, the walls and bottom covered with plank ; the same 
arrangements to continue outside, conducting the drainage freely to the 
creek beyond, and if necessary build a dam to prevent the overflow of 
the banks. The stream from the Stockade to the railroad should also 
be improved, and the use of it by the troops or others outside should be 
prohibited. Sinks should be at once arranged over the stream of such 
a nature as to render them inviting ; at present, those who have an in- 
clination to use them have to wade through mud and faeces to use them. 
At the upper part of the stream, proper bathing arrangements should 
be constructed. 



I 



SANITARY REPORTS OF SURGEON WHITE. 549 



III. Enforce Stringent Police Regulations. — Some stringent rules of 
police should be established, and scavenger wagons should be sent in 
every day to remove the collections of filth. A large quantity of mouldy 
bread and other decomposing matter scattered tnrough the camp and 
beyond the dead-line, should be removed at once. If necessary, senti- 
nels should be instructed to fire on any one committing a nuisance in 
any other place than the sinks. 

IV. Establishment of Regulations in regard to Clea?iliness. — It should 
be the duty of Confederate sergeants, attending roll-calls, or others, to 
see that all men of their command bathe at stated intervals, and that 
their clothes are washed at least once a week. For this purpose soap 
should be issued to the prisoners. 

V. Improvement in Rations. — The meal should be bolted or sifted 
before being issued. Arrangements should be speedily made by which 
rice, beans, and other anti-scorbutics should be issued during the present 
season ; green corn might be issued in lieu of bread ration, if not regu- 
larly, at least three times a week. If possible, the prisoners should be 
supplied with vinegar, and with an occasional issue of molasses in lieu 
of the meat ration, which would tend greatly to correct the scurvy which 
prevails to a great extent. 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

ISAIAH H. WHITE, 
Brigadier-General John H. Winder. Chief Surgeon of Post. 

Office of Surgeon in Charge, C. S. Military Prison Hospital, | 
Andersonville, Ga., Sept. Isl, 1864. ) 

Sir, — Having been assigned to duty in charge of the C. S. Military 
Prison Hospital at this place, and finding no building of any Report of 
character whatever for the accommodation of the sick and |"J!fenronto 
wounded, I respectfully submit to your consideration the ac- lelfera" 
companying plan of a series of sheds for the accommodation *^'^°''®- 
of the sick and wounded, covering a space of ground four hundred and 
fifty by nine hundred feet. 

These sheds can be erected very rapidly, and with but little expense 
to the government. 

I propose to make these sheds one hundred feet long, twenty-two feet 
wide, and eight feet high at the eaves. Posts set in the ground, with a 
streamer running the entire length of the building, twelve inches from 
the eaves, to which is attached an awning made from old tents (of which 
any quantity can be procured). This at once gives a ward that will 
contain fifty patients (the awning to be raised or lowered at pleasure) in 
a well ventilated room. I propose to erect forty of these sheds, giving 
ten to the division, with a capacity of five hundred patients to the divis- 
ion, or two thousand to the hospital. 

I also propose a cooking, baking, and convalescent dining-room to 



550 REPORTS OF SURGEON STEVENSON. 

each division, with one special diet kitchen and laundry to the whole 
hospital, the whole to be inclosed with a stockade. Outside the stockade 
I propose to erect a suitable depot building for the reception of com- 
missary stores, medicines, etc. A hospital of this description can be 
erected at this post, or any other, where lumber and material are so 
easily procured, with much less cost to the government than by any 
other means. 

While tents may answer for temporary purposes, I am opposed to 
using them for permanent hospitals, it being a matter of impossibility 
to keep them properly policed. 

Hoping that this plan may meet with your favorable consideration, 
and that I will receive your cooperation on this subject, 

I have the honor to be,

Sir, — I have the honor to report to you that I have been assigned 
Report of to duty by Surgeon I. H. White, Chief Surgeon of Post, in 
ISrou to charge of Confederate States Military Prison Hospital. 
General' ^^ assumiug the responsibilities of so important a position, 

Moore. and before entering upon my duties, I deem it necessary to 

make the following statement of the sanitary condition of the hospital, 
and appliances for the comfort of the sick and wounded. The topog- 
raphy, climate, and prevalent diseases of the country have been given 
you in former reports by my predecessor ; I shall confine myself prin- 
cipally to the following. 

T. Nature of Barrack Accommodations. — The Stockade (in the shape 
of a parallelogram) includes twenty-seven acres of ground. A consid- 
erable stream of water passes through it, running west and east. In 
this space of ground, from thirty to forty thousand prisoners have been 
crowded, with no protection whatever from the burning rays of the sun, 
except such as could be made from blankets or dirt hovels. Along the 
banks of the stream the ground is quite boggy, and water is constantly 
oozing from the low banks. Recently, four sheds have been built inside 
the Stockade ; these were the beginning of a series of barracks capable 
of accommodating two hundred and seventy men each. A temporary 
structure is erected on the banks of the stream, and is used as a privy 
All the inmates of the prison use this horrid cesspool of excrementitious 
matter as a privy, except the sick, and they are compelled to dig small 
holes near their hovels and use them for the deposit of faeces. The 
stream that flows through the Stockade overflowed its low swampy banks 




SANITARY REPORT OF SURGEOIST STEVENSON. 551 



in the early part of the season, and the amount of faecal matter deposited 
a short distance from the outside of the Stockade is enormous. At all 
times of the day and night a most noisome stench arises from the de- 
composing excrementitious matters deposited in the prison and hospital 
grounds. 

From three to four thousand sick and wounded men are inside the 
Stockade. The number of medical officers is entirely inadequate to the 
demands of the sick. At present writing, only four medical officers are 
on duty ; whereas, to take the proper care of the sick and wounded, 
there should be not less than twenty-five efficient medical officers con- 
stantly on duty in the Stockade, in order to meet the wants of the sick, 
and keep the proper register and reports. Under the present regime, 
hundreds die in the Stockade, and are buried, whose names and diseases 
are imknown. This can be remedied by no other means than by a 
sufficient corps of medical officers. All the medical officers who have 
been on duty here are detailed men from the militia, and contract phy- 
sicians, and as a matter of course are very inefficient. 

II. Nature of Hospital Accommodations. — The Hospital is situated 
near the southwest corner of the Stockade, covering about five acres of 
ground, inclosed by a frail board fence. A sluggish stream of water 
flows through the southern part of the lot. The ground is sloping, and 
facing the southeast. On the southwest side of the inclosure is a 
swamp, about three hundred yards in width, and on the northwest side 
is the stream which flows through the Stockade. The banks being very 
low, and subject to overflow, from these swamps arise putrid exhalations, 
at times almost insupportable. It will be seen by the accompanying 
drawing that the hospital is but a short distance from the confluence of 
the branch and the creek ; and although on rolling table land, it is much 
lower than the surrounding country, and very near where the branch 
disembogues from the Stockade, occupying such a position that all the 
surrounding depressing agencies would seem to centre in the Hospital. 

As well as in the Stockade, the number of medical officers is deficient, 
being composed (with a few exceptions) of men who are either detailed 
or under contract. On examining the roster, I find that twenty-four 
medical officers are charged to the hospital, and yet but twelve are on 
duty. The rest, either by order of Governor Brown (at their own re- 
quest), are off* on sick leave, or leave of indulgence. In order to attend 
to the wants of the sick and wounded, not less than thirty efficient 
medical officers should be on duty in the hospital. Confusion will neces- 
sarily occur without this number. 

From eighteen hundred to twenty-five hundred patients are crowded 
into this space. Tents of a very inferior quality are the only means of 
protection, a majority of them being in the small ' A ' tents. Tempo- 
rary bunks are erected in most of them by driving forks into the ground, 
and placing small poles or boards to lay on ; a great number of patients 



552 SANITARY REPORT OF SURGEON STEVENSON. 

are compelled to lie on the ground, in consequence of the smallness of 
the tents. The cooking arrangements are very deficient ; two large 
kettles, erected on a furnace, are nearly all the utensils that are used. 
The bread is of the most unhealthy character, being made of coarse, 
unbolted corn meal. This of itself, under the most favorable circum- 
stances, must prove a source of great irritation to the bowels. Scurvy, 
gangrene, and bowel affections are prevailing at present to an alarming 
extent. Frequent issues of green corn, pease, molasses, vinegar, rice, 
flour, and sweet potatoes are being made ; and under suitable hospital 
accommodations, the condition of the sick would be greatly ameliorated. 
The purveyor's department has been able to supply nearly all the neces- 
sary medicines. The indigenous remedies are being extensively used 
with much good effect. The medical officers in charge of the different 
wards and divisions are all diligent, and seem willing to discharge their 
duties, although laboring under many and great disadvantages. 

Great efforts have been made to make the Stockade secure, and pre- 
vent the escape of the prisoners ; and but little attention is paid to the 
hygienic and sanitary condition of the sick. 

Surgeon I. H. White, Chief Surgeon of Post, informs me that timely 
requisitions have been made on the quartermaster's department for the 
necessary materials to make the sick and wounded comfortable, but thus 
far he has been able to procure scarcely any thing. The means of trans- 
portation being very limited, both by railroad and teams, have proved 
a source of great annoyance. I would respectfully suggest that the 
necessary steps be taken to secure transportation for hospital material 
over all other stores, except ammunition. This would at once remedy a 
great evil. 

The greatest amount of confusion seems to have prevailed in conse- 
quence of soliciting attaches for the Hospital from Federal prisoners, in 
place of disabled Confederate soldiers. Great waste in property, medi- 
cines, and provisions has been the result. This I shall endeavor to cor- 
rect as speedily as possible. 

I would respectfully request that an efficient quartermaster and com- 
missary be ordered to report to me for special hospital duty, with full 
power from the War Department to provide for the comfort of the sick 
and wounded Federal prisoners. Without an arrangement of this kind, 
I very much fear the hospital department in C. S. Military Prison will 
continue to be neglected. Hoping that this communication may meet 
with favorable con^deration, 

I have the honor to be, 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

R. R. STEVENSON, 

Surgeon in Charge, 
To S. P. MooKE, Surgeon-General, C. S. A. > 
Richmond, Va. I

Comparison between the Diseases of the Federal Prisoners and Confederate Soldiers per- 
forming Guard Duty- — Malarial aiid Typhoid Fevers more prevalent amongst the Con- 
federate Troops. — Hospital Gangrene amongst the Confederate Troops. 

I FOUND no record of the diseases of the Confederate garrison 
at Andersonville previous to July. 

The following tables present a consolidated report of the sick 
and wounded of the different regiments and companies j^^^^^.^. ^^ i

TYPHOID FEVER AMONG CONFEDERATE GUARD. 563 

It will be seen from the preceding table that the Con- Extent of 
federate troops composing the garrison suffered severely confederate 

^ ,. ^ ^ ° ° "^ troopsfrom 

irom disease. disease, and 

During the months of July and August, with a mean ing diseases, 
strength of 3755 officers and men, 211T cases and 6 deaths were 
entered upon the field, and 367 cases and 56 deaths were entered 
upon the hospital reports. If the hospital report be consolidated 
with the field report, the per cent, of cases to mean strength would 
be 66.1. Nearly one fourth, or 584, of the cases of disease are 
recorded as acute and chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. In the 
hospital nearly one fifth of the cases of diarrhoea terminated fatally ; 
and six out of thirteen cases of dysentery, or very nearly one half, 
died. 

No case of typhus fever was reported amongst either the Fed- 
eral prisoners or Confederate troops. 

During a period of six months, from 1st of March to 1st of Sep- 
tember, 1864, 473 cases and 185 deaths from typhoid fever The preva- 
were recorded amongst the Federal prisoners, the number typhoid 
of the prisoners confined during this period being about 40,- confederate 
611. The per cent, of deaths from this disease amongst greater than 
the Federal prisoners was 39.1, or one death in 2.55 prisoners. 
cases. In the Confederate forces guarding the Federal prisoners 
during the months of July and August, with a mean strength of 
3755 officers and men, 102 cases of typhoid fever, with 38 deaths, 
were recorded. The ratio of deaths to cases of typhoid fever were 
very nearly as great amongst the Confederate troops as amongst 
the Federal prisoners, being one death in 2.68 cases, or 37.2 per 
cent, of deaths. The ratio of cases of typhoid fever to the mean 
strength amongst the Confederate forces was, however, nearly 
three times as great as amongst the Federal prisoners ; being in the 
former in the ratio of one case of typhoid fever in 36.8 men, or 
2.71 per cent, of the entire command, suffered with typhoid fever ; 
and in the latter, one case of typhoid fever in 86 Federal prisoners, 
or 1.16 per cent, of the mean strength. 

The greater prevalence of typhoid fever amongst the Confed- 
erate troops is still further shown by the fact that these statistics 
related to only two months, whilst those of the Federal prisoners 
embrace a period of six months. 

This difference appears to be due to the fact that the Confederate 
forces were composed of reserves between the ages of sixteen and 
eighteen, and forty and fifty years, and had been but recently 
collected together for service. They were raw troops who had not

as yet passed through the diseases of camp. On the other hand, 
the Federal prisoners had passed through most of the diseases inci- 
dent to raw troops, as measles and typhoid fever. 

It is also worthy of note that the various forms of malarial fever 
Greater prev- prevailed morc cxteusively amongst the Confederate 
Jja^aria/ forccs than amongst the Federal prisoners ; for during 
^^^^^' the period of only two months, July and August, 581 

cases were reported, or 15.4 per cent, of the mean strength of the 
Confederate troops ; whilst amongst the Federal prisoners, during 
a, period of six months, from the 1st of March to the 1st of Sep- 
tember, the cases of malarial fever (remittent, intermittent, and 
congestive) numbered 2958, and the deaths 113 ; that is, 7.2 per 
cent, of the mean strength of the Federal prisoners were affected 
with malarial fever during this period of six months. 

The Federal prisoners were imprisoned in a hot, and to a certain 
extent, malarious climate. They were to a great extent unaccus- 
tomed to either the extreme heat, or the malaria of the swamps. 

The Confederate forces, on the other hand, were natives of the 
soil, and had been in many cases subjected to tliese influences from 
birth. 

It would have been but reasonable to suppose that the former 
would have suffered more severely from malarial fever than the 
latter. 

We can only account for the comparative immunity of the Fed- 
eral prisoners on the supposition that the artificial atmosphere 
created by the immense accumulations of filth and human excre- 
ments within and around the Stockade and Hospital counteracted or 
destroyed in some unknown manner the malarial poison. 

The emanations of the Stockade and Hospital appeared to affect 
Confederate evcu the Confederate troops, and especially when, as in 
fected by the first two or three months after the establishment of 

emanations i • i i • t t i i 

from the the prisou, thcy were encamped unmediately around the 

stockade n 

and Hospital, walls. 

I was informed by the Confederate surgeons that when the Con- 
federate troops were camped within a short distance of the Federal 
prisoners, the mortality was far greater than during the months of 
July and August, after their removal to the adjoining hills, from 
half to three fourths of a mile off. I had selected a commanding 
eminence immediately overlooking the Stockade upon which to 
pitch my tent, during the prosecution of my labors in the Prison 
and Hospital, but ^vas induced to remove my quarters across the 
railroad to a shady hill, upon the advice of one of the surgeons, 



MORTALITY OF CONFEDERATE GUARD.

rho informed me that the regiment camped upon that spot origi- 

dly selected had suffered heavily with a fatal form of continued 

5ver. ^ 

During the months of July and August 2494 cases of disease 

^ere recorded amongst the Confederate troops ; that is, 66.4 per 
^ent. of the entire command was entered upon the sick list during 
short period, and the loss by death,- although far less than 
imongst the Federal prisoners, still amounted to 2.2 per cent. If 
bhe same mortality continued through the entire year, the com- 
mand would lose by death alone 13.2 per cent, of the mean strength. 
Such mortality would insure the complete obliteration of the com- 
mand by disease alone in the short period of about seven years and 
seven months. From the testimony of the surgeons in charge of 
the Confederate troops, I was led to believe that the ratio of mor- 
tality had been even much greater than this whilst the forces were 
camped in close proximity to the Prison and Hospital. 

In the chapter upon hospital gangrene, we will show that the 
Confederate soldiers guarding the prisoners were in several in- 
stances attacked with hospital gangrene, in small sores and abra-

668 MALARIAL FEVER. 

This table establishes — 
Conclusions Ist. With the increase of heat in May, there was an 
malarial incrcasc of cases of malarial fever, both absolutely in re- 
from the lation to the mean strength, and relatively to the entire 

foregoing , r> • i 

table. number oi sick. 

2d. From the month of May there was a progressive decrease 
of cases of malarial fever, both absolutely in relation to the mean 
strength, and relatively to the entire number of sick. 

The reverse condition existed amongst the Confederate forces 
during the months of June, July, and August. 

The march of malarial fever amongst these Federal prisoners 
did not conform to the almost universal law of the progressive 
increase of these diseases during the months of May, June, July, 
August, and September in the Southern States. 

We can account for the progressive diminution of malarial fever 
only upon the supposition that just in proportion as the Stockade 
and Hospital became crowded and foul, and possessed of an artifi- 
cial atmosphere reeking with the effluvia from human excrements, 
and fermenting bread and offal of all kinds, the malarial poison 
was either destroyed, or its action was neutralized by more power- 
ful deleterious agents. 

The comparative immunity from the action of malaria of large 
bodies of human beings, whether congregated in armies or cities, 
would appear to favor the view that the malarial poison is definite 
in amount and constitution, and is either so diluted by its action 
upon large masses, that it fails to induce its usual effects, or else 
that it is neutralized by the action of animal exhalations. 

Such facts as these, established by this great experiment upon 
forty thousand men, suddenly translated from northern regions to 
a hot, malarious climate, and crowded upon a small space of land 
which rapidly became loaded with all manner of filth, mihtated 
strongly against the doctrine of the cryptogamic origin and propa- 
gation of malarial fever. In this immense mass of putrefying ex- 
crements and bread there existed apparently a most suitable nidus 
for the development and rapid multiplication of almost all the 
lower forms of microscopical plants and animals ; and in fact I 
have never seen so extensive and rapid a production and growth 
of cryptogamous plants as was manifested in the fragments of bread 
scattered in and around the Stockade and Hospital. The com 
bread thrown away in large quantities by the prisoners soon be- 
came thoroughly penetrated and coated over with fimgi. The de- 
velopment of animalcules as well as of myriads of maggots in the 
human excrements consisting in large measure of undigested food,

11 the conditions appeared to exist in this hot and filthy place 
the generation of yellow fever, except sea air and foreign im- 
portation, and yet no case was reported during the season most 
favorable to its development. 

3d. But a comparatively small number of the Federal prisoners 
were affected with malarial fever, and the deaths from 
this disease amounted to but a very small fraction of the 
deaths from all causes. Thus the per cent, of the cases 
of malarial fever to the mean strength was 7.3, to the 
entire cases of all diseases, 6.9 ; and the ratio of deaths from mala- 
rial fever to the mean strength was only 0.26 per cent., and 1.5 
per cent, of the deaths from all causes. 

Malarial fever prevailed to a far greater extent amongst the 
Confederate troops serving in the department of South Carolina, 
Georgia, and Florida ; and in certain localities the efficiency of 
entire commands was greatly impaired by the various forms of 
paroxysmal fever. 

The following table, illustrating the numerical relations of mala- 
rial fever to other diseases, and its effects in reducing the Numerical 
strength of the command serving at Fort Jackson, and maiariaife- 
the surrounding river batteries situated in the low rice diseases, 
lands of the Savannah River, will furnish data for comparison.

each month, and the new cases of malarial fever averaged each 
month 220. 

During this period of fifteen months, 3313 cases of malarial 
fever in the form of congestive fever, quotidians, tertians, quartans, 
and remittents occurred,; whilst all other diseases, including also 
those diseases, as neuralgia and dropsy, which might be traced in a 
njeasure to the action of malaria, numbered 1935 cases, or only a 
little more than one half the number of cases of malarial fever. 

Throughout the entire period more than one fourth the command 
were unfit for duty ; and during the fall months more than one 
half of the garrison was on an average incapable of performing 
military duty. 

In this command of less than 1000 Confederate troops during 

six months, March to August, 1863, 1427 cases of malarial fever 

were entered upon the sick list, whilst amongst the 40,000 Federal

572 CASES AND DEATHS FROM MALARIAL FEVER. 

During a period of nineteen months, January, 1862, to July, 
Analysis of 1863, iuclusive, in the Confederate army servino; alone; the 

foregoing . . "^ r> i^ 

tables. sea-coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, with 

an average mean strength of 25,723 officers and men, 157,013 
cases of disease and wounds were entered upon the field reports, 
and of this number 41,526 cases were recorded under the heads 
of the various forms of malarial fever. Congestive fever, quotid- 
ian, tertian, and quartan intermittents and remittent fever collect- 
ively constituted a little more than one sixth, or 16.3 per cent, of 
all the diseases entered upon the field reports. The number 
of cases of malarial fever reported monthly varied from 1.5 per 
cent, to 21.3 per cent, of the mean strength ; and during this pe- 
riod of nineteen months the per cent, of cases of malarial fever in 
the command was 161 ; or in other words, each man on an average 
had been entered upon the sick list with one or the other of the 
forms of paroxysmal fever 1.6 times. 

During this period, 39,750 cases were entered upon the hospital 
reports, and of this number 10,957 were recorded as congestive, 
intermittent, and remittent fevers ; that is, 27.5 per cent, of all 
the diseases were unmistakably malarial in their character. The 
ratio of malarial diseases would be far higher upon the field and 
hospital reports, if various other afi'ections clearly referable to the 
action of malaria, as neuralgia, anasarca, anaemia, splenitis, debil- 
ity, and in many instances diarrhoea and dysentery, were added. 

The deaths from all causes in the field numbered 924 ; in the 
hospitals, 1584 ; total in field and general hospital, 2508 ; giving a 
ratio of 9.7 per cent, of the mean strength during this period. 
The deaths from malarial fever numbered 227, or 0.84 per cent, of 
the mean strength, and 9 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. 

If six months corresponding to that period of the year in which 
the Federal prisoners were confined at Anderson ville, namely, 
March to August, 1862, be selected in the preceding tables, it will 
be seen that in a command of Confederate troops serving along the 
Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, with a 
mean strength of 26,006 officers and men, 12,410 cases of malarial 
fever were entered upon the field reports, with 35 deaths ; and 
4835 cases upon the hospital reports, with a mortality of 94, giving 
a total mortality from malarial fever of 129, whilst the deaths from 
all causes during these six months numbered 1215. It is evident 
therefore, fi'om the preceding statistics, that during a period of six 
months, March, April, May, June, July, and August, 1864, the 
per cent, of cases of malarial fever in the mean strength of the 



MALARIAL FEVER AT SAVANKAH. 573 

Federal prisoners was 7.3 ; whilst during the same months, in 
1862, the per cent, of cases of malarial fever amongst the Confed- 
erate forces under consideration was 47.7 ; the per cent, of deaths 
from malarial fever amongst total number of Federal prisoners was 
0.26 ; and amongst the Confederate troops from the same causes 
0.48 per cent. 

Certain localities suffered much more heavily than other portions 
of the coast from malarial fever. Thus the Confederate Prevalence of 
troops manning the lines around Savannah, and the forts fever among 
in the low rice lands around this city, and in the rich low troops 
lands formed by the sediment of the Ogeechee and Sa- savannah. 
vannah rivers, were greatly injured by the malarious influence. 
During the months of August, September, October, November, and 
December, 1863, in the command serving on the coast of Georgia, 
and chiefly in and around Savannah, with an average mean strength 
of 5898 officers and men, 9 cases of congestive fever, 2930 cases 
of quotidians, 2596 cases of tertians, 80 cases of quartan intermit- 
tents, and 733 cases of remittent fevers were entered upon the 
field reports, giving a grand total of malarial fevers during this 
short period of 6339 cases in this small command. 

In the fall of the year it was difficult to keep up the Confederate 
guards in the low rice lands surrounding Savannah, and the sol- 
diers could not be exposed to the damp malarious exhalations from 
those rich river bottom lands for two or three nights consecutively 
without being smitten with one or the other of the forms of malarial 
fever. Many lives were lost, and many constitutions were ruined for 
life, by the slow action of this hidden poison ; and the pale, anaemic, 
exhausted Confederate soldier, with sallow complexion, enlarged 
spleen and torpid liver, palpitating heart and depressed spirits, paid 
a silent but noble tribute to his native land, as he tramped his 
weary rounds in the still hours of the night along those battle- 
ments, still facing with undaunted courage an unseen but deadly 
enemy. 

On account of the strict blockade of the Confederate ports, and 
from the fact that medicines had been declared contraband Difficulty of 
of war by the Federal government, it was found to be im- quinia. 
possible, or at least impracticable, to protect these men system- 
atically by the daily use of quinine. On the other hand, the 
United States forces along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts suffered 
far less than the Confederate troops from malaria, because they 
occupied, as a general rule, the most healthy sea islands exposed to 
the sea, and surrounded on the land side by salt-water rivers and

marshes. These islands have been noted for their healthfiilness 
and immunity from malarious diseases since the first settlement of 
the country. In addition to this, the United States have been 
open to the commerce of the world, and it is said that the United 
States medical officers have protected their men wherever exposed 
in unhealthy malarious localities, by the free use of quinine as a 
prophylactic.

MALARIAL FEVER IN ARMY OF TENNESSEE. 



675 



In a command with an average mean strength of 6752 officers 
and men, during a period of eighteen months, 58,453 cases of dis- 
ease were entered upon the sick reports, and of this number nearly- 
one fourth, or 13,668 cases, were recorded as congestive, intermit- 
tent, and remittent fever. The ratio of cases of malarial fever in 
the mean strength varied monthly from 2.9 to 32.2 per cent., and 
the ratio of cases of malarial fever to the meai;i strength during the 
entire period of eighteen months was 202.4 per cent. In this com- 
mand each man on an average was entered upon the sick list, with 
one or the other of the forms of malarial fever, a little over twice 
during eighteen months.

table. the monthly reports during fourteen months (April, 1862, 

to May, 1863) ; and of this number 40,203 were recorded as con- 
gestive, intermittent, and remittent fever ; that is, 15.5 per cent, 
of all cases treated were classified under five forms of malarial 
fever. In this army, the monthly ratio of cases of malarial fever 
to the mean strength officers and men ranged from 4.2 to 17.9 per 
cent. 

Even the army of General T. J. Jackson (" Stonewall Jack- 
Preyaience ^^^ ")' scrviug in the Valley of Virginia, one of the most 
fevSnIhe ^Icvated and healthy regions of the Confederate States, 
^'Ttorrewaii suffcrcd to a greater extent from malarial fever than the 
Jackson." Federal prisoners. 

Before instituting an examination of the numerical relations of 
the malarial affections of this army, it will be of interest to con- 
sider the main topographical features of the Valley of Virginia. 

According to Captain Jed Hotchkiss of the engineer staff" of 
General " Stonewall " Jackson's army — 

" This region lies under the isotherm of a mean temperature of 
Topographical seventy-two degrees for the four summer months of June, 
Jre'vluey^of ^^^y^ August, and September, and comes within the region 
Virginia. of from eight to ten inches of summer rain. ... In 
addition to the temperature and the moisture, there is a peculiarity in 
the location of the Blue Ridge that is an important element in this 
connection. The Potomac River at Harper's Ferry, at the mouth of the 
Shenandoah, has an elevation of two hundred and forty-two feet above 
the sea level ; at Waynesboro, on the Virginia Central Railroad, one hun- 
dred miles southwest, the Shenandoah has an elevation of one thousand 
two hundred and sixty-one feet ; the mouth of North River of the James, 
sixty miles southwest, is elevated seven hundred and one feet. These 
points give us the elevation of the eastern side of the valley, the west- 
ern base of the Blue Ridge. Again, the summit of the Blue Ridge at 
Harper's Ferry is about twelve hundred feet ; at Rockfish Gap, near 
"Waynesboro, it is nineteen hundred and ninety-six feet ; and at the pas- 
sage of the James, it is, I suppose, about twelve hundred feet. This 
gives us an average rather too low for the crest of the ridge. The 
eastern base of the Blue Ridge on the Central Railroad, at Mechum's 
River, has an elevation of four himdred and forty-nine feet ; it is not 
more than two hundred where the Potomac leaves it, and about six 
hundred where the James leaves it above Lynchburg. See from these 
data what a long slope the eastern or sunny side of the Ridge has. But 
it may be said its elevation is such, that much of it must be exposed to 



XARIAL FEVER IN STONEWALL JACKSON'S ARMY. 577 



cold winds and sudden atmospheric changes. We will call attention to 
a few more figures. The Virginia Central Railroad crosses the Valley 
of Virginia at right angles to its course, and when it reaches the foot of 
the North Mountain, on the west side of the valley, it is at an elevation 
of sixteen hundred feet ; three miles further on it is two thousand and 
seventy-three feet, above tide, higher than the top of the Blue Ridge ; 
yet the mountain west of it is two thousand three hundred and seventy- 
five feet above it, or four thousand four hundred and forty-eight feet 
above tide ; and this is true of the whole chain of the great North or 
Kitatening Mountain, for the three hundred miles that it stretches in a 
graceful curve, and under various local names, along the western side 
of' the great valley, parallel to the Blue Ridge, and at a distance from 
it of about twenty-five miles. It is everywhere from fifteen hundred to 
two thousand feet higher than the top of the Blue Ridge. And what 
follows from this ? The valley rises from east to west, in its width of 
twenty-five miles, over five hundred feet. It lies to the sun like a hot- 
bed ; any one knows what follows from that. But further, the North 
Mountain is to the Blue Ridge a high sheltering wall — it breaks the 
cold winds to the northeast that come sweeping over the vast plain that 
stretches from the Arctic Ocean almost to the western base of the Al- 
leghanies ; it and the mountains west of it condense the moisture of 
these winds, and rob them of their snow. Man never built such a wall 
to protect a vineyard, to throw back upon it the accumulated warmth 
of a reflector three hundred miles long and two thousand feet high." 

The following table gives the numerical relations of malarial 
fever to the mean strength and total cases of disease and wounds 
in the army of the Valley of Virginia, under the command of Gen- 
eral " Stonewall " Jackson, during a period of ten months, Jan- 
uary to October, 1862.

In the army of General Jackson, with an average mean strength 
of 15,582 officers and men, during a period of ten months, 53,198 
cases of disease and vrounds were entered upon the field reports, 
and of this number 3876 were recorded under the heads of con- 
gestive, intermittent, and remittent fever. 

Whilst it is evident from these statistics that the relative number 
Greater prev- of malarial cascs was far less amongst the Confederate 
malarial troops scrviug iu the elevated, healthy, and long settled 
army of the and Cultivated Valley of Virginia, than amongst the Con- 
ginia than federate forces along the Atlantic and Gulf coast, at the 
prisoners at samc time it is worthy of note that malarial fever was 
Tiiie. more prevalent in the army of the Valley of Virginia than 

amongst the Federal prisoners at Anderson ville. Thus, during six 
months of 1862, March to August, 2357 cases of congestive, inter- 
mittent, and remittent fever were recorded upon the field reports 
of General Jackson's army with a mean strength (average) officers 
and men of 13,839 ; whilst during the corresponding months in 
1864, only 2966 cases of malarial fever were entered upon the 
sick reports of the Federal prisoners, with an average mean strength 
during this time of 21,120 ; or the relative proportion of malarial

iseases in the two bodies of men may be more readily compre- 
hended by stating that in the former seventeen per cent, of the 
mean strength suifered with one or the other forms of malarial 
fever ; whilst in the latter, fourteen per cent, of the mean strength 
suffered with the same diseases. 

And as far as our information extends, even the United States 
forces, with all the advantage of position, and of un- Maiariai 
bounded supplies of quinine, and of the best and most pre^ai^^^ 
wholesome food, suffered more extensively w^th malarial united *^*

" Under the several heads of quotidian, tertian, quartan, and at Anderson- 
congestive intermittents, 72,810 cases were reported to the 
Surgeon-General's office during the year ending June 30th, 1862, in re- 
ports representing an average annual mean strength of 281,177 men ; so 
that 259 men of every 1000, or more than one fourth of the whole army, 
suffered from these affections during the year. Of these, 40,375 cases 
and 32 deaths were reported under the head of quotidian, 26,750 cases 
and 33 deaths as tertian, 3451 cases and 4 deaths as quartan, and 2234 
cases and 351 deaths as congestive." ^ 

These results would have been still more striking if remittent 
fever had been included with the intermittents. 

The comparative immunity from malarious disease amongst the 
Federal prisoners is still further slwwn by the small num- The smaii

Confederate troops, as will be seen by the following table.

Finally, I confirmed, by personal inspection of the sick, and by 
post-mortem examinations, the truth of the preceding Absence of 
statement, that the various forms of malarial fever, as mortem 
well as the results of the action of malaria g-enerally, denoting

were comparatively rare amongst the J^ederal prisoners poisoning 
confined at Anderson ville. Diseases with true malarial prisoners at

olina, Georgia, and Florida ; thirteen amongst the forces serving 
along the Gulf of Mexico ; and fifty-eight amongst the large 
armies serving in and around Vicksburg, and in Mississippi, Ala- 
bama, Kentucky, and Tennessee, including the army of Tennes- 
see. During this period of nineteen months, the average monthly 
mean strength of the Confederate forces reported upon the field 
reports, on file in the Surgeon-General's Ofiice, C. S. Army, from 
whence these statistics were consolidated, numbered 160,231 
officers and men, and amongst this number one hundred and 
eighty-four cases of sun-stroke were reported. Considering the 
heat of the southern climate, and the arduous nature of the ser- 
vice performed by the Confederate troops, this was an inconsider- 
able number, and the deaths from this cause were comparatively 
few. 

Only eleven hundredths of one per cent, of the Confederate 
troops were affected with sun-stroke during a period of nineteen 
months ; whilst during six months twenty-five hundredths per 
cent, of the average mean strength of the Federal prisoners were 
affected by sun-stroke. 

In their debihtated and depressed state, with imperfect shelter 
from the hot sun, and with little comfort or pleasure in the pres- 
ent, and with but little hope for the future, it is not surprising that 
the prisoners should have suffered fi'om this cause.

684 DISEASES REFERABLE TO EXPOSURE. 

During this period of six months, 528 cases of pneumonia, with 
Analysis of 234 deaths from this disease, were entered upon the sick 
table. reports ; nearly one half, or more accurately, 44.3 per 

cent, of the cases of pneumonia terminated fatally ; whilst only 
2.5 per cent, of the average mean strength were affected with 
pneumonia, and it constituted only 1.2 per cent, of all the diseases 
treated during this period, and the deaths from this disease 
amounted to only 3 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. 114 
cases of phthisis were reported, of which near 29 (28.9) per cent, 
proved fatal. The cases of pleuritis numbered 451, and the deaths 
32, or 7.3 per cent, of the cases treated. Under the head of acute 
bronchitis, 770 cases are recorded, with 61 deaths ; the ratio of 
deaths to cases in this disease being 7.9 per cent. 

The cases of acute and chronic rheumatism, numbered 854, or 
17.9 per cent, of the total diseases caused chiefly by exposure, and 
only 2 per cent, of the diseases from all causes ; and only 4.2 per 
cent, of the average mean monthly strength, during this period of 
six months, were reported as affected with acute and chronic rheu- 
matism. 

The ratio of cases of disease, referable chiefly to exposure, to the 
total diseases entered each month, progressively diminished, as the 
season advanced and the weather became warm, from 24.3 per 
cent, in March, to 11.1 per cent, in August ; and the ratio of 
deaths in this class of diseases in like manner diminished progress- 
ively in relation to the deaths from all causes, from 32.8 per cent, 
in March, to 2.3 per cent, in August. The cases of disease result- 
ing chiefly from exposure numbered 4784, or 22.6 per cent, of the 
mean strength ; and 11.2 per cent, of the total diseases and wounds 
treated during six months ; and the deaths fi'om this class of dis-

PNEUMONIA AMONG CONFEDERATE TROOPS. 591 

Pneumonia prevailed to fully as great an extent amongst the 
Confederate troops, and caused a large number of deaths. PreTaience 
Tlius in a command with a monthly mean strength of nia among 

. . , T '^ „ theConfed- 

zbJz'S omcers and men, servmg m the department oi erate troops. 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, during a period of nineteen 
months (January, 1862, to July, 1863), 2220 cases of pneumonia, 
with 127 deaths, were entered upon the field reports, and 1786 
cases, with 370 deaths, upon the hospital reports. As the cases 
were in most instances entered upon the field reports, and then 
transferred to the General Hospitals, we will approximate more 
nearly to the truth by assuming that the 2220 cases of pneumonia 
entered upon the field reports included those also transferred to the 
general hospitals ; and the mortality of the cases treated in gen- 
eral hospitals should be added to the mortality of the cases in the 
field, thus giving a mortality of 497 in 2220 cases of pneumonia. 
According to this calculation, 22.3 per cent, of the cases of pneu- 
monia occurring in the department of South Carolina, Georgia, and 
Florida, terminated fatally ; or one death occurred in 4.4 cases. 

In the Confederate army serving on the Gulf of Mexico, in and 
around Mobile, with a mean monthly strength of 6752, the cases 
of pneumonia numbered 1161, and the deaths from this disease 
151, during a period of eighteen months ; or one death occurred in 
7.6 cases of pneumonia. 

In the army of Tennessee, during a period of fourteen months, 
8278 cases of pneumonia were recorded, with 1291 deaths ; the 
ratio of deaths from this disease being 15.5 per cent., or one death 
in 6.4 cases. These returns were incomplete, and related chiefly 
to the field reports. The hospital reports, which were still more 
incomplete than the field reports, gave a still higher mortality. 

Upon the field reports of General T. J. Jackson's army, serving 
in the Valley of Virginia, during a period of ten months, with an 
average monthly mean strength of 15,562 officers and men, 1034 
cases of pneumonia were reported. During this short period 6S 
per cent, of the mean strength were affected with this disease, 
giving a far higher ratio of cases of pneumonia to the mean strength 
than amongst the Federal prisoners confined at Andersonville. The 
number of deaths fi:'om pneumonia entered upon the field reports 
of General " Stonewall " Jackson's army was only 50, or only 4.8 
per cent, of the cases. The returns of deaths were incomplete ; 
and it was also time that the cases of pneumonia in this active and 
fighting army were in most cases transferred to the general hos- 
pitals, and chiefly to the large General Hospital at Staunton. The

.' 



During a period of forty-four months, July, 1861, to February, 
1865, in the General Hospital at Staunton, Va., 833 cases of 
pneumonia were treated, with 191 deaths. In this large and well- 
conducted hospital 22.9 per cent, (or one death in 4.3 cases) of the 
cases of pneumonia terminated fatally. A portion of this mortality, 
as well as of the mortality fi'om typhoid fever and gunshot wounds, 
was attributable to the previous exposures and fatigue of the sick 
during their transportation from a distance, and to the sudden 
crowding of the hospital, during the active operations of the Confed- 
erate forces in the valley of Virginia. This will be clearly seen 
from the following extracts from the quarterly reports of Surgeon 
James Alexander Waddell and of Surgeon WiUiam Hay : — 



PNEUMONIA IN VIRGINIA HOSPITALS. 593 

General Hospital, ) 
Surgeon-General S. P. Moore. Staunton, Va. I 

SiR^ — Shortly after my last quarterly report, from some cause not 
appreciable, there was a decided decrease in the number of Report of 
very sick men in this hospital for a week or ten days. But walaeu on 
soon, ffom the crowded condition of the wards, consequent atlSXs^-^ 
upon army movements, and the breaking up of hospitals out ffun'on 
West, diseases which had not been marked by even the usual Virginia, 
mortality assumed more serious characters and results. The typhoid 
fever, so commonly associated with bronchitis and diarrhoea, now as- 
sumed more of the typhus element, as manifested by the pneumonia 
complication ; sordes upon the teeth ; injected eyes, and often costive 
state of the bowels. A decided increase of erysipelas of the different 
varieties also occurred, and assumed an unwonted severity and malig- 
nity. But where no unusual transformations or lesions existed, certain 
results were justly attributable in many instances to transfers where pa- 
tients were in a moribund state, or in whom the vital powers were worn 
out, under the exhausting influences of a tedious and ill-timed transpor- 
tation. 

JAMES ALEXANDER WADDELL, 

Surgeon-in- Charge. • 

Surgeon Wm. Hay, in his monthly report to the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral, for November, 1862, remarks : — 

" I would state that the large number of deaths this month is owing 
to the state of the men when received into the hospital. A Report of 

^ Surgeon 

great number died twelve hours, or less, after getting here. Hay. 
A large number in forty -eight hours. These men had been brought 
from Winchester in ambulances ; many had to be freely stimulated to 
get them into the wards. Three men were brought to the hospital dead 
in the ambulances." 

WILLIAM HAY, 

Surgeon-in- Charge, 

The statistics of the general hospitals of Virginia, exclusive of 
the hospitals in and around Richmond, possess great in- statistics of 
terest as furnishing the most reliable data for the deter- f^ th^hS^

a period of fourteen months, 4864 cases of pneumonia aSund*^*'^ 
were entered upon the hospital reports, with a mortality »^°^°»«°<*- 
of 1261 ; the ratio of deaths amongst this large number of cases

forces will be still further considered in the next chapter, in con- 
nection with the observations on typhoid fever. 

From official sources we infer that pneumonia has prevailed to 
as great an extent amongst the Federal armies, and with as high a 
ratio of mortality : 11,061 cases, with 2134 deaths, having been 
reported prior to July, 1862, giving the high mortality of 19.3 per 
cent., or one death in 5.1 cases. 

The diseases referable to exposure prevailed to as great an extent

this class of diseases was 19.9 per cent, of the 157,013 cases 
disease and wounds entered upon the reports ; and 109.3 per cent] 
of the mean strength were entered upon the sick reports with onif

On the Gulf Coast, 7680 cases were recorded as due to thi 
class of diseases, out of 60,473 cases of all kinds ; or 12.5 pel 
cent, of all diseases entered during eighteen months were referable 
to pneumonia, pleuritis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, phthisis 
catarrh, and rheumatism ; and 113.7 per cent, of the mean strengtl 
were entered upon the sick reports v>dth one or the other of thes 
diseases. 

In the army of Tennessee, during a period of fourteen months^ 
36,830 cases of disease referable chiefly to exposure w^ere recordec 
in a total number of 259,393 cases ; the ratio being 14.1 per cent 

10,182 cases of these diseases were recorded upon the sick re

2043 cases of acute and chronic rheumatism were entered dur- 
ing eighteen months upon the sick reports of the Confederate 
forces serving on the coast of Alabama ; 30.2 per cent, of the 
monthly mean strength of this command were therefore during 
this period entered upon the sick reports with rheumatism. 

In the army of Tennessee, 10,762 cases of rheumatism were 
treated during a period of fourteen months, thus giving a ratio of 
4.1 per cent, of all diseases. 

In the army of General "• Stonewall " Jackson, 2558 cases of 
rheumatism were entered upon the field reports during a period of 
ten months ; 16.3 per cent, of the mean strength of this army were 
entered upon the sick reports with rheumatism, and this disease 
constituted 4.8 per cent, of all the diseases treated. 

An examination of the preceding statistics of chronic and acute 
rheumatism reveals no progressive increase of this disease jjo progress- 
amongst the Confederate troops. 'Jf xhe^a- 

If the view of certain writers be true, that a large num- theContM? 
ber of cases entered upon the sick reports of armies as hTnce^cl^eV 
acute and chronic rheumatism are nothing more than rL^'umatism 
symptoms of scurvy, then it follows necessarily that ^ilie "o^^"' 
chronic and acute rheumatism should have been far more ^^"^^y- 
prevalent amongst the scorbutic Federal prisoners than amongst 
the Confederate troops during the earlier periods of the war ; and 
that upon the scant salt diet without fresh vegetables, to which the 
Confederate troops were necessarily confined during the war, the 
number of cases of rheumatism would have progressively increased, 
as the Confederate soldiers became more and more scorbutic. To 
test this question fairly, we have drawn up the following tabic, in 
addition to the statistics already presented.

598 SCORBUTIC RHEUMAllSM. 

If the statistics of each individual hospital entered upon this 
table be examined with a view to determine the relations between 
the total number of cases of all diseases and of rheumatism entered 
each month, it will be evident that there was no progressive in- 
crease of rheumatism amongst the Confederate troops, notwith- 
standing the progressive increase of scurvy, and of a scorbutic 
condition of the blood, as manifested in the progressive increase 
of hospital gangrene and of secondary hemorrhage amongst the 
Confederate wounded. 

On the other hand, Dr. Hanbury, in his account of scurvy as it 
prevailed in the British army during the war against Russia, 1854— 
1856, observes that — 

" One of the most constant precursory symptoms of scurvy was an 
Dr. Hao- obscurc form of muscular rheumatism ; the individual com- 
count^of plained of pains in his legs of an aching character, and his 
prevlfied^a movcments were tedious and painful ; there was in these 
Armyln^he ^asGS no articular inflammation observed, and though the feet 
war with and legs were generally edematous, there was little enlarge- 
1854-56. ment of the ankle joints. The affection has probably been 
in some instances mistaken for rheumatism, and perhaps treated in the 
ordinary manner ; but it was merely one of the signs of general ca- 
chexia, and advantageously treated by a return to the comforts of ordi- 
nary life. It is, perhaps, possible to explain the occurrence of the 
pains by reference to the depraved condition of the blood and its pecu- 
liar operation upon the nervous filaments, or the irritability of the 
muscular fibres. They were, however, not unfrequently observed during 
the recovery from fever, and were in these cases much complained of 
in the back and loins ; and it may be stated that in fever the relation 
between the muscular and nervous system was usually very much dis- 
turbed, and before debility was induced in the course of protracted dis- 
ease, there was often almost total inability to command the use of the 
limbs, or to exert on them the efforts of the will, and apparently this 
indication was to some extent connected with a scorbutic taint of the 
system." ^ 

Dr. William A. Hammond, formerly Surgeon-General of the 
Views of United States Army, has taken the same ground in an 
mond and article ou scurvy published by the United States Sanitary 
ward. Commission, and expresses his belief that there is " but 

little doubt that many of the cases designated in the medical re- 
ports as chronic rheumatism are, in reality, of a scorbutic na- 
ture." 2

Similar views are expressed by Dr. Woodward in the chapter 
on " Pseudo-Rheumatic Affections " in his " Observations of the 
Chief Camp Diseases of the United States Armies." In support 
of his observations, Dr. Woodward also quotes the testimony of 
Surgeon Basil Norris of the United States Army.

there ?nd^^ with abnormal human excrements and fragments of bread 
elsewhere. ^^^ saturated with urine, and the atmosphere was loaded 
with stinking effluvia. During the recent civil war I sought for 
typhus fever amongst the Confederate troops serving in the field, 
and amongst the general hospitals in various parts of the Confed- 
erate States ; thousands of sick and wounded were examined with 
a view to the determination of the existence or non-existence of 
this disease amongst the Confederate armies ; and even the prison- 
ers confined upon Belle Isle, in the Libby Prison, and in Castle Thun- 
der, in Richmond, Va., were not neglected in these examinations, 
and numerous medical officers of the Confederate army were inter- 
rogated upon this subject personally and by letter. No case of 
true typhus fever came under my observation during the war in 
any army, in any field hospital, general hospital, or military 
prison. 

The cases entered upon the Confederate sick reports as t}']Dhus

armies, which had been but recently imported from the bogs of 
Ireland, and from the hovels of the densely populated European 
countries. The statements of various surgeons with reference to 
cases of typhus fever occurring in the Confederate armies, have 
already been considered in my report to the Surgeon-General on 
typhoid fever. The following table presents the numerical rela- 
tions and mortality of typhoid fever, measles, and small-pox amongst

reported amongst over 40,000 men, with an average dersonviiie 
monthly mean strength of 21,120, during a period of six months. 
The cases of typhoid fever constituted only a little over one per 
cent, of the entire number of cases of disease entered upon the 
sick reports, and of the entire number of prisoners confined during 
six months at Andersonville. If the view advocated by some 



602 BUDD'S THEORY. 

writers that typhoid fever is frequently caused from the exhalations 
of human excrements, and especially by the exhalations from dis- 
eased human excrements, be true, then we are at a loss to explain 
the comparative immunity of these prisoners fi'om this disease. 

The fact is that the problem of the origin of typhus and typhoid 
fever is not so simple as some writers would lead us to suppose. 

We do not as yet understand fully the effects of the effluvia of 
excrements, and putrefying animal and vegetable matters.^ 

From an extended and we trust candid review of facts bearing 
upon the crowded condition of the Federal prisoners at Anderson- 
ville, we feel justified in drawing the following conclusions : — 

1. Facts recorded by various observers tend to prove that no

crements. ters, and privy-cleansers, ana all men engaged m remov- 
ing the filth and oifal of large cities, from the various forms of 
continued fever, and even from cholera, militates strongly against 
Budd's ^^1^ theory of Dr. William Budd, who afflrms that tlie 
diffusfon^o?^ bowel discharges are means by which patients, whether 
fe£-°by migratory or stationary, can be instrumental in dissemi- 
ilStSinaV^* nating typhoid fever and cholera. If, according to Dr. 
excreta. Budd, the dcjectious of typhoid fever are " charged with 
matters on which the specific poison of a contagious fever has set 
its most specific mark, and to inhale sewer emanations is, therefore, 
under conditions of the most frequent occurrence, actually to inhale 
the very quintesscence, so to speak of a preexisting fever ^^^ how is 
it possible for those to escape typhoid fever who most commonly 
inhale the emanations from privies and sinks in the large cities of 
London and Paris, from which typhoid fever is never absent ? 

How is it possible to reconcile the comparative immunity of the 
class of scavengers from contagious fevers with the statement of a 
recent writer, that — 

" In large towns the sewers are constantly charged with the materies 
morhi of specific diseases always abounding in towns ? " . . . '* In 
small villages and other places, where no sewers exist, the air only may 
be infected, or the water contaminated, by the direct or indirect im-

portation of cases of specific disease, or their equivalents — the poison 
itself — so that the organic impurities, the dung-heaps, the open soil 
which surrounds the dwellings of the patients, the cesspools, and the 
privies common to several houses, gradually but eventually become im- 
pregnated with the specific poison of the disease. Thus the atmosphere 
of the village may become incomparably more virulent than the atmos- 
phere of the sick-chamber itself. Hence the rapid epidemic spread of 
the miasmatic diseases in the limited space of rural villages, which 
gives rise to the popular error that such diseases are invariably conta- 
gious in country places, and only rarely so, or by exception, in cities or 
large towns." ^ 

If the contagious nature of typhoid fever be admitted, might 
not the relative greater proportion of persons liable to the disease 
in the country and villages where it more seldom prevails, as well as 
the intimate relations and associations and constant visiting amoncrst 
the entire population, and especially the collection together at stated 
periods in one or more houses of worship of a large proportion of 
the inhabitants, account for the apparent more extended action of 
the fever after its introduction into small towns and villages, with- 
out the necessity of resorting to the hypothesis of the propagation 
of the disease by the emanations of the cesspools. However, if 
the entire lesion of typhoid fever be the characteristic manifesta- 
tion of the disease, corresponding to the eruption of small-pox, we 
must admit that the theory of Drs. Budd, Simon, and Aitken, has 
much plausibility, and even probability. According to this view, 
the discharges from the bowels in typhoid fever might be regarded 
in the same light, as far as their contagious nature was concerned, 
as the matter formed upon the surface and cast off in the form of 
scabs in small-pox. We would certainly be disposed to admit the 
contagious nature of the scabs of small-pox, whether found in the 
clothing and bedding, or cast off into any comparatively dry and 
confined space. The admission of this theory does not at all over- 
throw the assertion that animal putrefaction does not generate 
under any circumstances a contagious fever ; for in the case of the 
excrements voided in typhoid fever, the pojson is the result of the 
actions going on in the living body, and is not the product of 
the decomposing excrements. 

2. The emanations from putrefying animal matter and excre- 
ments generate deleterious gases, as sulphureted hydro- geJferated in 
gen, and hydro-sulphuret of ammonia, which act in a ^"f^^Smft- 
definite manner upon the animal system, inducing disor- J^^entrdo

EFFECTS OF GASEOUS EMANATIONS.

diseases. muscular systeiiis, attended with variations of the pulse and 
temperature — in fact, with the deranged actions ordinarily called 
fever ; but such diseased states produced by these foul exhalations 
do not follow the course of the well-known contagious diseases, as 
typhoid fever, small-pox, measles, and typhus fever. As far as our 
knowledge extends, the various gases resulting from the decompo- 
sition of animal matters produce injurious effects upon the system, 
which are no more contagious than the diseases produced by 
arsenic, mercury, or any other well-known poison or medicinal 
agent. 

A w^ide field for experiment and observation is open for the de- 
termination of the mode of action and effects of small portions of 
the deleterious gases generated during the putrefaction of animal 
matter and human faeces, acting continuously through long periods 
of time upon the human constitution. We are as yet without any 
series of investigations upon the effects of definite admixtures of 
atmospheric air and carbonic acid gas upon the phenomena of life. 
The results of the observations of various writers upon night- 
men, sewer-hunters, and all those exposed habitually to foul ema- 
nations from decomposing animal matters and faeces, go to show 
that the human constitution readily adapts itself to these delete- 
rious influences, and is capable of throwing them off and of main- 
taining itself in a state of comparative health. 

A careful series of experiments upon the effects of varying 
proportions of each and every one of the various constituents of 
the emanations from sewers, cesspools, and decomposing corpses, 
through considerable periods of time, would throw much light upon 
many difficult questions in hygiene and sanitary science generally. 
Such investigations should be preceded by a careful examination 
of the varying products of putrefaction under different conditions 
of temperature and moisture, and of varying supplies of oxygen. 
3. If the preceding propositions be admitted, and if the falsity 
of the doctrine of spontaneous generation of plants and 
animals be maintained, and the view be clearly held that 
no organized form, animal or vegetable, however simple 
in structure and functions, can arise spontaneously from 
any form of matter, inorganic or organic, in any condition 
or combination, or under any circumstances ; then it 
necessarily follows that if any contagious diseases are 
due to the action of special vegetable or animal forms, 
such living animals and vegetables or their germs could

All the paroled Federal prisoners, who had an extra *^^po^«d- 
ration, and were able to make considerable sums of money by 
trading clandestinely with their friends in confinement, enjoyed 
most robust health, notwithstanding frequent, and we might say 
constant, exposure to the foul exhalations of the Stockade and Hos- 
pital ; and in truth these paroled men were stronger and healthier 
than the Confederate guard who were confined to a single ration. 

The ephemeral febrile states produced, and the conditions of 
ill health established by the action of deleterious emanations fi'om 
decomposing animal matters, will vary in character and extent 
according to the habits and diet and original constitution of those 
exposed ; and the states of system thus induced will be more or 
less favorable to the spread of contagious diseases after their 
specific germs or active principles of propagation and development 
have been introduced.

does not at all prove that the difference of health of air. 
various localities is due to the varying amounts of organic matter 
in the air. Neither are there any established facts to show that 
epidemics are in any manner connected with the organic matter 
existing in the air. We have recorded a large number of facts to 
show that those occupations in which it is necessary to breathe an 
atmosphere rank with putrid animal matters are not necessarily 
injurious to the health ; nor are they more injurious to the health 
than occupations in which a far less, and in reality the minimum, 
amount of putrescent organic matter is respired. The universality 
of the presence of this organic matter in the atmosphere, as shown 
by the numerous experiments of Dr. Smith, completely over- 
throws all special hypotheses like those of Dr. Hume, with refer- 
ence to yellow fever. The organic matter which he detected may 
or may not have been connected with yellow fever ; it may have

been harmless animalcules or sponiles, or comparatively innocuous 
matter existing in a gaseous state, or the exhalations from cess- 
pools possessing injurious actions wholly different from yellow 
fever. 

It certainly requires, in the present imperfect state of our 
knowledge upon this subject, a* great exercise of the imagination 
to refer the existence of epidemics to the action of an undefined 
organic matter existing in varying proportions in all parts of the 
atmosphere breathed by man. 

The problems of sanitary science are of too complicated a 
nature to be solved by such suppositions, based as they are, too, 
upon comparatively imperfect and unsatisfactory means of investi- 
gation. 

Before any general laws can be announced and established, it 
will be necessary : 

First, to show the chemical composition and relations of the 
Require- various foHns of orgauic matter found in the air of vari- 
th^elb^h- ^'^^ localities, and determine definitely what portion is 
genSarLTni- dclcterious, and under what conditions and from what 
tary laws. gourccs it is formed. 

Second, the effects of the prolonged action in varying propor- 
tions of the products of putrefaction already known, as sulphureted 
hydrogen, hydro-sulphuret of ammonia, and carbonic acid and car- 
bonic oxide, carbureted hydrogen and phosphoreted hydrogen, and 
sulpho-cyanide of ammonia. 

Third, the effects of moral causes, care and vice, cheerfulness, 
industr}^, and happiness ; of excessive muscular action, putrescent 
food, foul water, insufficient food, air, and sunlight, starvation, the 
abuse of alcoholic stimulants, and all causes which tend to produce 
morbid conditions of the blood and a condition of ill health, and a 
tendency to putrescence in the living structures ; and of continued 
exposure to cold, with scant supplies of food and clothing ; and of 
special poisons, as syphilis ; and of the hereditary diseases developed 
and aggravated by the vices and modes of living in large cities. 

A correct determination of the mortality and disease due to any 
one cause, necessarily presupposes the elimination of the disturb- 
ances produced by other causes or agents. 

The influence of such depressing causes as sameness of diet, 
Theinflu- loug-continucd imprisonment, depressed spirits, neglect 
pressing of persoual cleanliness and of general sanitary regula- 
inthehigb tious, wcrc clearly seen in the high rate of mortality

cent., or one death in two and five tenths cases. Tiiie. 

One hundred and twenty-six cases and ten deaths are recorded 
under the head of common continued fever. It is probable that a 
large number of these cases were typhoid fever. The mortahty, 
therefore, of this disease was probably less than thirty-nine per 
cent. Great as this mortality appears to be, it is actually less 
than that of one or two of the Confederate hospitals. 

By an extended series of observations, I was enabled to estab- 
lish the following points of interest with reference to conclusions

Atlantic Ocean along the coast of Carolina and Georgia, oc7urred^^^ 
where, up to the present w^ar, typhoid fever has been a troopf coi- 
very rare disease, this disease was almost unknown as ^g^mJuts, 
long as these companies, chiefly of cavalry, were kept p^g'jo^j^^**"' 
within this region and assigned to detached service. dS^^^ 
When these companies were collected together into regi- p"^^*^'^^- 
ments, and mingled with other companies in which typhoid fever 
was prevailing, and which were composed of troops raised in the 
more elevated regions where typhoid fever prevails, then this dis- 
ease attacked the troops of the companies raised in the malarious 
districts, which had been previously exempt from the disease. 
After the introduction of the disease amongst the companies raised 
in those regions where typhoid fever was previously almost un- 
known, then it prevailed to as great an extent and with as fatal 
results (if not with more fatal results) as amongst the troops from 
the more elevated and healthy regions. 

h. As soon as large bodies of Confederate troops were collected 
in various portions of the Confederate States, typhoid as the war 
fever made its appearance and prevailed to a great ex- S^^^^^^

veterans were comparatively exempt from the disease, and it was 
confined chiefly to the new recruits. The disease would have

In this respect, therefore, typhoid fever followed the laws of

Surgeon Carrington accompanies this report with the following 
interesting observations : — 

" Eruptive fevers constitute an important class in the reports required 
from medical officers of the Confederate States army. On in- Observations 
specting the records of the first division of this class, erysipe- Carrington. 
las, the uniformity in the number of cases occurring in each month is 
worthy of notice ; while in other divisions the well-known prevalence 
in the colder, and the diminution in the warmer, seasons of the year 
are well illustrated, especially in the reports of small-pox in the months 
of August, September, December, and January. It should be con- 
sidered that many of the cases reported as of this division are trau- 
matic, and should not properly be classified among 'eruptive fevers,' 
but as instances of ' local erysipelatous inflammation.' 

" The second division of this class is one of the most interesting to 
the army surgeon, from its universal prevalence among soldiers. The 
reports from April, 1861, to October, 1862, would show a much greater 
prevalence than here reported. When it is remembered that only the 



610 SURGEON CARRINGTON'S OBSERVATIONS. 

severe cases of this diseases are sent to hospitals, the mortality appears 
slight. 

" The reports of scarlatina bear out the experience of previous observ- 
ers, that it is not a disease of armies. 

" The sixth division, embracing all anomalous forms of eruptive fever, 
were probably cases of roseola, and were so slight that no deaths are 
reported as having occurred among them. 

" The fourth and fifth divisions of this class, comprising modifications 
of the same disease, will painfully attract, both by the large number of 
cases occurring and the rate of mortality. From actual observation 
and investigation at the time, I can definitely pronounce upon the 
origin and progress of small-pox in these hospitals. On October 18th, 
1862, the first cases were brought to Richmond from Fort Delaware. Up 
to that time no cases had been reported here for some months in the 
army or among citizens. By the 31st of October twelve cases had been 
reported. In carefully tracing each, it was determined that those from 
Fort Delaware did not disseminate the disease, being quarantined and 
avoided by all ; but that soldiers from the army of Northern Virginia 
had brought the disease to the hospitals, and being unconscious and un- 
suspected, had exposed many to it before the diagnosis was made. The 
army had just reached the vicinity of Winchester after evacuating 
Maryland, subsequent to the battle of Sharpsburg. There were but 
few cases from the army, and those had not been prisoners, nor had 
they seen any returned prisoners. These cases went to Charlottesville, 
Lynchburg, and Richmond, at which points the malady spread, but 
much more rapidly and extensively at Richmond. 

" It is a fact of interest that the disease has not spread in the army. 
The free ventilation of the field, with the men in bivouac and without 
even tents, seems to have so diluted the poison that it could not repro- 
duce the disease in others. So in general hospitals no combination of 
remedies, regimen, or expedients have been found so much to influence 
the progress or termination of the disease as free ventilation. A dimi- 
nution of the capacity of the hospitals from eight hundred to sixteen 
hundred cubic feet for each patient showed sensible effects, and removal 
to large tents still more reduced the mortality. 

" There are several reasons by which we may rationally account for 
the great excess in the mortality of small-pox over that in ordinary 
civic practice : — 

" 1st. The mass of the army, being from the rural population, be- 
came soldiers unprotected by vaccination. In cities, where the rich 
and the poor are by public or private expense all vaccinated for gener- 
ations, the disease assumes a modified form ; while in races not hered- 
itarily protected, as among our American Indians, it assumes as malig- 
nant a form as that existing before Jenner's great discovery. 

^' 2d. The subjects of the disease were men previously debilitated by 



MALIGNITY OF THE RICHMOND EPIDEMIC. 611 



L 

this is now superadded the consciousness of being afflicted with a 
loathsome, obnoxious, and dangerous disease, and the bad effects of re- 
moval from one hospital to another. 

" 3d. The Malignity of the Epidemic. — Of this I have much evidence 
from my own observation ; but I beg leave to quote the very forcible 
and apposite remarks on this subject contained in a letter of January > 
1863, from Dr. Albert Snead, City Physician of Richmond : — 

" ' I have had charge of the City Hospital for about ten years, and never 
during that time has there been so extensive prevalence of small-pox, nor has 
the percentage of mortality risen so high as during this visitation. Not only 
among the soldiers who have been under my care, but also among the resident 
population, the mortality has been fearfully great. Nor have I in any former 
visitation witnessed so large a percentage of confluent cases, or so many strictly 
malignant cases — cases in which the experienced eye would detect evidences 
of a necessarily early and fatal termination. Before this visitation I have never 
seen a case so malignant as to terminate life in less than six days from the first 
appearance of the eruption ; while, during this prevalence of the disease, I have 
seen many cases ending in less time — some within three or four days. Moreover, 
heretofore, I have never seen a case of varioloid prove fatal ; while in this visit- 
ation I have witnessed several cases terminating in death, and that, too, after 
the patients had apparently been doing well for days together ; suddenly they 
would begin to give away, without manifesting any special local trouble, and, 
despite the use of stimulants and other sustaining treatment, gradually sink 
and die. I have been distressed and annoyed at these unexpected deaths, and 
can only account for them by supposing that the poison in this visitation is un- 
usually malignant, overcoming the vital powers even in those cases which for a 
lime appeared to be proceeding favorably. I have observed that the tendency 
to the formation of abscesses is greatly increased over former visitations — 
patients who had suffered moderately mild attacks, even of varioloid, scarcely 
escaping them. From this I infer that the poison of the visitation is with diffi 
ciilty ehmlnated, the endermic eruption, as is usual, not accompanying it.' 

" As extraordinary efforts have been made to protect by vaccinating, 
with pure and reliable virus, the army and all persons exposed to its 
influence ; as the most scientific means have been taken to prevent the 
disease, and to treat it when incurred, by every resource known to the 
profession, I cannot attribute the mortality to want of care or skill in 
the medical officers having charge of the cases." 

It is important to note, in connection with these observations of 
Surgeon Carrington, that the P'ederal prisoners confined at Ander- 
sonville brought the small-pox with them from Richmond, Avhere 
they had been previously imprisoned, and Avhere a most malignant 
form of the disease was prevailing, botli amongst the Confederate 
soldiers and private citizens.

The mortality from variola and varioloid was much less in this 
hospital attached to the army of Tennessee than in the general 
hospitals of Virginia, and amongst the Federal prisoners at An- 
dersonville ; the ratio of fatal cases being in the cases of variola 
26.3 per cent., and in the cases of varioloid only 1.7 per cent., and 
in both forms of small-pox combined 18 per cent.

EFFECTS OF VACCINATION.

l\e preceding table presents valuable data for the compar- 
ison of these results with the statistics of European hos- statistics of 

, European 

pitaiS. hospitals. 

During the first period of twenty-five years vaccination was un- 
known, while during the second it was universally prac- t)iminu- 
ticed; and the table shows that the ravages of natural poxby^^c-" 
small-pox have been diminished by the inti'oduction of "^'^*i°°- 
vaccination in the proportion of thirty-two and a half to thirty. 
The mortality during the last period is certainly very high, and 
greater even than amongst the Confederate troops, when it is 
known that in the preceding table the cases of varioloid are in- 
cluded with those of variola. In 1825 the rate of mortality rose 
as high as 41 per cent, in the unprotected, as will be seen by the 
folio winoj table : —

Effect of 
vaccination 
on the rate 
of mortality 
from small- 
pox. 



A remarkable difference will be perceived between the deaths 
which have occurred among the unprotected and those 
who had obtained the advantage of previous vaccination. 
The records of the hospital of St. Pancras present but few 
instances of a rate of mortality as high as forty-one per 
cent. ; yet it was believed by the author of this report that this 
would have been the average of 1825 but for the influence of vac- 
cination. From this table it appears that more than a third of the 
patients admitted had been previously vaccinated. The disease, 
ho\vev"er, was so much modified, and in most instances so extremely 
slight, that one hundred and thirteen of the one hundred and forty- 
seven left the hospital, cured, within fourteen days from their ad- 
mission. In a few, convalescence was protracted to three or four 
weeks. Twenty-five passed through the disease in its natural or 
unmodified form, of whom twelve died ; as shown by the cicatrix

among those ^ ^ ^ '^

from fourteen and a half to sixty per cent. ; and that the mortality 
from small-pox amongst the Federal prisoners confined at Ander-

Philadelphia in 1825, and but little greater than the mortality from 
this disease at Verona (1828-39), Breslau (1831-33), and in the

stmctlon of the tissues, and necessitating amputation in more than 
one instance. During the prosecution of my investigations at An- 
dersonville, I examined several of these cases. 

These accidents led to the belief amongst some of the prisoners 
that the surgeons had intentionally introduced poisonous matter 
into their arms during vaccination. 

After careful inquiry I was led to the conclusion that these acci- 
dents were, in the case of these Federal prisoners, referable in a 
great measure, if not wholly, to the scorbutic condition of their 
blood and to the crowded condition of the Stockade and Hospital. 

The smallest accidental injuries and abrasions of the surface, as 
from splinters or bones, or bites of insects, were in a number of 
instances followed by such extensive gangrene as to necessitate 
amputation. 

The gangrene following vaccination appeared to be due essen- 
tially to the same causes ; and in the condition of the blood of these 
patients would most probably have attacked any puncture made by 
a lancet without any vaccine matter or any other extraneous ma- 
terial. It appeared also that the dried scab resulting from the vac- 
cination of scorbutic patients frequently produced effects wholly 
different from the vaccine lymph of healthy individuals, and in 
some cases these effects were of a most potent and injurious char- 
acter. 

Similar accidents following vaccination occurred in the Confed- 
erate armies, and a number of deaths, both amongst the The same 
troops and citizens, w^ere directly referable to the effects curred in the 
of vaccination. So great was the evil that it was made a armies, 
special subject of investigation, and a number of most interesting 
reports were prepared by several of the corps, division, brigade, 
and hospital surgeons and medical inspectors, upon what was most 
generally called in the army " spurious vaccination." My friend, 
Surgeon Jackson Charabliss, in charge of Ward No. 1, Camp 
Winder Hospital, had examined and recorded a large number of 
cases of spurious vaccination, and illustrated the cases with valu- 
able drawings of the various local diseases and skin affections. As 
far as my information extends, this valuable mass of matter, relat- 
ing to one of the most important subjects in its bearings upon the 
welfare of the human race, was destroyed during the evacuation 
of Richmond by the Confederate forces. So common had acci- 
dents become after vaccination, and so sti'ong was the prejudice 
growing both in the army and amongst citizens against its employ- 
ment, that I strongly urged the inoculation of cows with small-

pox matter, in order to produce, if possible, cow-pox, from whence 
a supply of jfresh and reliable vaccine matter might be obtained.; 
and with the assistance of Surgeon Harden and Assistant-Surgeon 
Langdon Carter, of the Empire Hospital, I inoculated a cow with 
the matter from the perfectly developed pustules of a case of con- 
fluent small-pox. It was my design to carry out an extensive 
series of investigations upon the various secondary affections fol- 
lowing vaccination ; and to determine, if possible, what infectious 
principles could be associated with the lymph of the vaccine ves- 
icle. These labors were brought to a sudden and unexpected 
close, by the disastrous close of the civil war. As far, however, as 
my labors amongst the Confederate troops extended, I was led to 
attribute the injurious effects of vaccination to the following 
causes : — 

I. Scorbutic condition of the blood of the patients vaccinated 
and yielding vaccine matter. Large numbers of the Confederate 
soldiers manifested slight scorbutic symptoms, which were not suf- 
ficient to attract attention or to induce treatment, and as far as I 
could learn, no attention was paid to this condition, either in vacci- 
nation or in the selection of vaccine lymph. In scorbutic patients 
all injuries tended to form ulcers of an unhealthy character, and 
the vaccine vesicles, even when they appeared at the proper time, 
and manifested many of the usual symptoms of vaccine disease, 
were nevertheless large, and more slow in healing, and the scabs 
presented an enlarged, scaly, dark, unhealthy appearance. In many 
cases a large ulcer, covered with a large, thick, laminated crust, 
from one quarter to more than one inch in diameter, followed the 
introduction of the vaccine virus into scorbutic patients. Matter 
from these scabs and sores was frequently used in vaccination, and 
this decomposing pus and blood acted as an animal poison in some 
cases, and especially in constitutions debilitated by exposure, fa- 
tigue, and salt diet. 

II. The employment of matter from patients who had been pre- 
viously vaccinated, and who were partially protected. 

Whilst it might admit of debate whether pure vaccine virus, ob- 
tained from persons never before vaccmated, and who manifested 
*all the phenomena of the disease, and especially the characteristic 
febrile phenomena, ever becomes deteriorated or possessed of dele- 
terious properties in its passage through numerous human bodies 
not suffering with such contagious diseases as syphilis ; on the 
other hand, it cannot be denied that the protective power of vacci- 
nation has been impaired to a lamentable and almost incalculable 
extent by a succession of imperfect vaccination^. 



INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF VACCINATION. 

'accination may be rendered imperfect by tlie development of 
febrile and other diseased states after the introduction of the virus 
into the system, arising from the action of cold or some other 
cause, producing constitutional disturbances differing essentially 
from the febrile phenomena which mark the progress and perfec- 
tion of the vaccine disease, as well as by its imperfect and altered 
course in those who are partially protected by previous vaccina- 
tions. 

In the isolated condition of the Southern Confederacy, cut ofp 
from the surrounding world, and denied even vaccine matter, as 
contraband of war ; w^ith the necessity of turning out the entire 
fighting population to repel invasion, and with the necessity of 
employing all the available medical aid, good, bad, and indifferent ; 
and in view of the progressive increase of small-pox, it is not 
strange that the process of vaccination was not as carefully watched 
and tested as it should have been, and that consequently much 
imperfect matter circulated extensively, as vaccine matter^ Avhich 
not only afforded little or no protection against small-pox, but also 
proved positively deleterious. 

III. Direct vaccine lymph, or scabs, in which decomposition had 
been excited by carrying the matter about the person for a length 
of time, and thus subjecting it to a warm, moist atmosphere. The 
effects of such putrefying matter resembled those of putrid animal 
matter. 

IV. Dried vaccine lymph or scabs from patients who had suf- 
fered with erysipelas during the progress of the vaccine disease. 

In several instances death resulted from phlegmonous erysipelas 
following vaccination, in apparently healthy patients, in both civil 
and military practice. 

V. Fresh and dried vaccine lymph or scabs from patients suffer- 
ing with secondary syphilis at the time and during the progress of 
vaccination and the vaccine disease. 

I examined at different times, during the progress of the recent 
war, and also had under my treatment various skin affections which 
presented the characters of the cutaneous diseases characteristic of 
secondary syphilis, which were directly traceable to impure vaccine 
virus. In several cases enlarged buboes in the axilla and groin 
accompanied the peculiar skin affections induced by " spurious 
vaccination." 

A number of the Confederate surgeons took the ground that 
secondary syphilis could be communicated along with the vaccine 
virus, and especially when the dried scabs were employed. In the 



618 INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF VACCINATION. 

records upon this subject, which I examined in the Surgeon-Gen- 
eral's Office in the Confederate capital, this view was clearly an- 
nounced and supported by well recorded and incontrovertible facts. 
Up to the commencement of the present civil war, the belief was 
almost universal that secondary syphilis could not thus be com- 
municated by vaccination.^

which are omitted, inasmuch as to this subject an entire chapter of the second section is 
devoted, and the writer of that chapter has availed himself of the writings of Prof. Jones

From the 1st of March to the 1st of September, 1864, 9501 
cases and 999 deaths were recorded under the head of dumber of 
scorbutus on the sick reports of those Federal prisoners gcu^^y^ de- 
confined at Andersonville. We also observe during the SroSy*"*^ 
same period the record of 1510 cases of anasarca and prl^oTer^at 
315 deaths ; 46 cases ascites and 4 deaths ; 50 cases ^"jeX'ring 
hydrops pericardii and 24 deaths ; 53 cases marasmus and ®^ ^lonths. 
53 deaths ; 875 cases debihtas and 168 deaths. 

It is probable that these cases and deaths from anasarca, ascites, 
hydrops pericardii, and the deaths from debility, were caused by 
the scorbutic condition of the blood, as well as by the deranged 
condition of the alimentary canal. 

The large number of deaths set down under the head of morbi 
varii and marasmus, were in like manner due chiefly, if Deaths from 
not entirely, to scurvy and diarrhoea and dysentery. The rnumlra" 
following table will present the relations of these various scurvy.

Nearly one half, or 44.9 per cent, of the monthly mean strength 
were entered upon the sick reports with scurvy; the 
cases of this disease constituted 20.1 per cent, of all dis- 
eases entered during six months ; the deaths from scurvy 
constituted 10.5 per cent, of the cases of this disease, and 
12.9 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. The other 
diseases recorded in the table, as anasarca, ascites, hydrops peri- 
cardii, etc., numbered in the aggregate 3008 cases with 1129 
deaths. The high mortality of 37.5 per cent, amongst this class 
of diseases can only be accounted for on the supposition that they 
were due to the scorbutic condition of the blood. If 
these cases be included with those of scurvy, then the 
total cases of scurvy would number 12,009 with 2128 
deaths ; and the ratio of deaths to the cases of this dis- 
ease would be 17.7 per cent. ; and the deaths from scurvy and

from all causes. This calculation, of course, yields only approxi-

the statement appears to be below the truth. During 
my investigations, it appeared that large numbers of the

prisoners, who liad never been reported sick, were suffering with 
mrvy, and almost every one of the older prisoners were more or 
)ss scorbutic. 
We have before alluded to the various symptoms manifested by 
lis disease at Andersonville, as the enlargement of the Symptoms

The swelling of the parotid glands in these cases of scurvy was 
generally a fatal symptom ; and in many cases this symp- Parotiditis 
tom appeared to precede death by only a few days. fatal event. 

In this foul atmosphere, the scorbutic ulcers, however excited, 
soon took on the appearance and action of hospital gangrene. 

The condition of the scorbutic patients did not differ from that 
given as characteristic of the disease by the oldest writers.^ 

In the description of the obvious and external phenomena of 
scurvy as it prevailed amongst these Federal prisoners at Ander- 
sonville, and in the determination and application of remedial and 
therapeutic means, I was able to add little or nothing to the elab- 
orate descriptions of the older writers, and especially the admirable 
delineations of Lind and Trotter.

meagre chemical researches upon the changes of the Thecondi-

be achieved mainly by careful chemical analysis of the solids and

desired to institute a series of analyses directed to the determina- 
tion of the amounts and variations in physical and chemical prop- 
erties of the fibrine, albumen, blood corpuscles, and saline constitu- 
ents of the blood, in various stages of the disease, and in its 
various manifestations and complications with inflammatory and 
febrile diseases, and had provided myself with such apparatus and 
re-agents as could be commanded in the Confederacy for such 
labors ; but seeing the foul ulcers and gangrene following the 
shghtest injuries, I did not feel justified in subjecting these prison-

The scorbutic state of these prisoners was directly referable to

who were allowed an extra ration, and who were able to supply 
themselves with whatever vegetables the country afforded by the 
sums of money which they made in trade with their fellow-prison- 
ers and the Confederate soldiers. The exhalation of the filthy 
quagmire of human filth appeared to exert but little or no injuri- 
ous effect upon these men, although they were in many instances 
equally exposed with those perishing with scurvy and diarrhoea. 
In considering this striking contrast, I was reminded of the obser- 
vation of John Woodall, ma^e more than two hundred years 
ago: — 

" That to any man of judgment, it may seeme a wonder, how a poore 
miserable man, coming on lande from a long voyage, even at the point 
of death, namely swolne sometimes to an exceeding greatnesse, not 
able to lift a legge over a straw, nor scarce to breathe, by reason of 
strong obstruction, yet, in a few dayes, shall receive the fulness of for- 
mer healthe, yea, with little or no medicine at all." 

Relative The following tables will enable us to form some idea 

and charac- of the relative amounts and character of the rations is- 
rations sucd to thesc prisoucrs and to the Confederate soldiers 

issued to the ,, 

prisoners generally. 

Confederate By the regulations for the army of the Confederate 
generally. Statcs, as adopted by act of Congress, approved March 
6th, 1861, the ration of the Confederate soldier consisted of — 

" Three fourths of a pound of pork or bacon, or one and a fourth 
pounds of fresh or salt beef; eighteen ounces of bread or flour, or 
twelve ounces of hard bread, or one and a fourth pounds of corn meal ; 
and at the rate, to one hundred rations, of eight quarts of pease or 
beans, or in lieu thereof, ten pounds of rice, six pounds of coffee, twelve 
pounds of sugar, four quarts of vinegar, one and a half pounds tallow, or 
one and a fourth pounds adamantine, or one pound sperm candles ; four 
pounds of soap, and two quarts of salt. On a campaign, or on marches, 
or on board transports, the ration of hard bread is one pound. . . . 

" When the officers of the medical department find anti-scorbutics 
necessary for the health of the troops, the commanding officer may order 
issues of fresh vegetables, pickled onions, sour krout, or molasses, with 



ar

an extra quantity of rice and vinegar. (Potatoes are usually issued at 
he rate of one pound per ration, and onions at the rate of three bush- 
Is, in lieu of one of beans). Occasional issues (extra) of molasses are 
ade — two quarts to one hundred rations — and of dried apples of 
from one to one and a half bushels to one hundred rations. Troops at 
sea are recommended to draw rice and an extra issue of molasses in 
lieu of beans. When anti-scorbutics are issued, the medical officer will 
certiiy the necessity and the circumstances which cause it upon the ab- 
stract of extra issues." 

As the war progressed, cut off as the Confederacy was from the 
surrounding world, it was found to be impossible to sup- impossiwi- 
ply coffee ; afterwards, as the sugar-growing regions of pJiug*c"offee, 
the Confederacy fell into the hands of the enemy, this subTtitutbn 
article, as well as molasses, ceased to be a component part ^earfor 
of the ration ; then from imperfect means of transporta- '^^****-^°"''- 
tion, as well as from the almost nominal value of the currency, po- 
tatoes, beans, dried apples, and vegetables generally were only 
occasionally issued in very small quantity, and rice disappeared 
almost entirely after the occupation by the Federal forces of 
a large portion of the coast ; and, finally, after the best grain 
(wheat) growing regions of the Southern States, as the Valley of 
Virginia, and Northern Alabama and Georgia, were overrun and 
devastated, Indian corn-meal was necessarily substituted to a large 
extent, and in many parts of the Confederacy wholly^ for wheat 
flour. And in 1864, during the period of these investigations at 
Andersonville, the Confederate ration issued to the soldiers in the 
field consisted of: beef, one pound, or in lieu one third pound 
bacon ; meal, one and a quarter pounds, with an occasional issue 
of rice, beans, molasses, and vinegar. 

It was difficult to procure regular supplies of beef, and the Con- 
federate troops were confined for considerable periods of Dinicuity of 
time to salt pork and bacon ; and the small allowance of reer,'iar"^,p. 
one third of a pound was frequently diminished to one ^^'^^ °^ ^^^^• 
half the quantity. 

During the earlier periods of the war, scurvy did not norprevafi 
prevail to any great extent amongst the Confederate wailmong^ 
troops, as will be seen from the following table : — era^te troop's.

It will be seen from this table that in an army with a monthly 
mean strength of 160,231 officers and men, and with 1,056,349 
cases of sickness and wounds entered upon the field reports in 
nineteen months, January, 1862, to July, 1863 ; during this period 
in the early history of the war, and in this immense number of 
cases, only 2203 cases of scurvy were recorded upon the field re- 
ports, and in 398,641 cases of sickness and wounds entered upon 
the hospital reports, only 2068 cases of scurvy were recorded. 
Although I have not at hand the statistics to demonstrate the 
progressive increase of scurvy amongst the Confederate 
troops, it is nevertheless true that this disease did increase 
as the rations of meat became more scant, and the trans- 
portation of supplies more difficult. In General Lee's 
army of Northern Virginia the symptoms of scurvy were, pre- 
vious to both of his invasions of Maryland and Pennsylvania, 
wide-spread, as manifested in the frequence of night-blindness, 
in the numerous accidents after vaccination, in the increase 
of secondary hemorrhage and hospital gangrene after wounds.

as well as in the actual manifestations of the disease, indispo- 
sition to exertion, spongy gums, uncertain and ill-defined muscu- 
lar pains, and obstinate diarrhoea and dysentery. The invasions 
of Maryland and Pennsylvania appear to have been dictated as 
much by a desire to improve the condition of the army of Northern 
Virginia by subsisting it upon the rich fields and valleys of the 
enemy, as by the necessity of relieving the distressed inhabitants 
and bloody soil of Virginia from the desolating march of contend- 
ing armies. Scurvy was beginning to manifest itself extensively 
in the other great army of the Confederacy, under the command 
of General Bragg, when it commenced its retrograde march from 
around Chattanooga ; and during the disastrous campaign of North- 
ern Georgia, culminating with the fall of Atlanta, hospital gan- 
grene, pyaemia, and secondary hemorrhage prevailed to an alarm- 
ing extent amongst the Confederate wounded. 

I have heard a number of Confederate surgeons affirm that the 
general health of the Confederate troops improved upon improve- 
short rations ; that is, fewer men were entered upon the ^^eraf *^* 
sick list when the rations were reduced to one half the confederate 
usual quantit3^ The progressive diminp.tion of certain Jhorr^" 
severe forms of disease, and the ability of the men to '^^*'°°^- 
stand exposure with comparatively little sickness toward the close 
of the war, was not at all necessarily connected with the decrease 
of rations. The health of the Confederate soldiers, without 
doubt, improved as the men became enured to fatigue and expos- 
ure, and were transformed into veterans. The destruction of the 
feeble, also, by various diseases, as typhoid fever and pneumonia, 
tended to diminish the lists and number of diseases ; and as only 
the stronger and more hardy were left, the sick list necessarily be- 
came smaller. The fact that typhoid fever is liable to attack' re- 
cruits, and as a general rule affects the individual but once during 
life, should also be carefully considered in attempting to estimate 
the causes of the progressive diminution of disease amongst the 
soldiers. 

The bravery and tenacity with which the Confederate soldiers 
continued the unequal strugcrle to the end, until worn out a large

to surrender to vastly superior numbers, shows that ceived. 
neither the courage nor the general strength was materially im- 
paired. It is difficult, however, to correctly appreciate the full 
effects of the scant rations upon the Confederate troops, from the 
fact that throughout the entire war they received an immense

amount of extra supplies from their friends and relatives, through 
the ladies, and through various state agencies and benevolent in- 
stitutions ; and much extra food was also gathered by private for- 
aging. The instinct of self-preservation was strongly and pro- 
gressively developed by the war ; and toward its close, the loose 
foraging of the Confederate cavalry upon friend and foe became 
proverbial, and some companies fairly won for themselves the dis- 
tinguishing title of " Butter-milk Rangers." 

In a country of such vast extent and of such wonderful agricultu- 
Secondary ral rcsourccs, and with such immense numbers, of cattle 
and hospital and hogs, and with such abundance of fruit, it became ex- 
dependent ceedingly difficult to determine the effects of the rations

active symp- iu uumcrous hospitals throughout the Southern Confed- 
scurvy were eracy, that whilst well-marked symptoms of scurvy were 
fested. not oftcu obscrvcd amongst the wounded, and whilst the 

men from the battle-fields generally presented a hardy and strong 
appearance, at the same time secondary hemorrhage and hospital 
gangrene progressively increased during the progress of the war ; 
and the former complication of gunshot wounds and operations fear- 
fully increased, becoming in the various hospitals, after the last great 
battles, of daily and even of hourly occurrence. This marked in- 
crease of secondary hemorrhage appeared to be referable to the pro- 
longed use of salt meat, and the consequent scorbutic condition of 
the blood, although the active symptoms of scurvy were not mani- 
fested. The increase of hospital gangrene may in like manner 
have been connected in a large measure with physical and chem- 
ical changes of the blood and organs dependent upon imperfect 
nutrition. 

That the preceding observations present a correct explanation 
of the absence of scurvy in its severe and fatal forms amongst the 
Confederate troops, notwithstanding that the rations issued were 
utterly inadequate of themselves to maintain the men in health, is 
conclusively demonstrated by the great suffering and heavy losses 
from scurvy of the French and English armies during the Crimean 
war, notwithstanding that the two most powerful governments of 
Europe furnished their soldiers with greatly superior rations, both 
in quantity, quality, and variety.^

the entire sea-coast, with the exception of a few isolated points, 
and the possession of a large portion of Florida, and especiallv of 
the southern peninsula, by the United States forces, the Confed- 
erate medical department was utterly unable to supply citric acid 
and oranges and lemons, in anything like adequate quantities, to 
the scorbutic patients of its own armies. The fact that the mor- 
tality amongst the Bederal prisoners confined at Anderson ville was 
less than could have been reasonably expected amongst a body of 
men strictly confined to the rations of salt meat, beef, and corn- 
meal issued to the Confederate soldiers in the field, can only be 
referred to the eflPorts made by the medical staff* and by the officers 
in charge of the commissary department to furnish the prisoners 
with such vegetables as could under the circumstances be com- 
manded in a sparsely settled countiy. ^ How far these efforts ex- 
tended I am unable to say ; neither is it possible for me fully to 
unfold the difficulties under which the officers in charge of these 
prisoners labored ; of the fact, however, that eflTorts were made to 
improve the condition of these unfortunate men I was convinced, 
not merely by the statements of the officers, but by seeing hun- 
dreds of the prisoners in the hospital cooking green pease and beans 
which had been famished them for the relief of the scurvy.

Causes of the 
prevalence 
of bowel 
afEectioDS. 



The great prevalence of bowel affections amongst the 
Federal prisoners were due to several causes, as — 

First. The long-continued use of salt meat and of 
coarse corn bread unbolted, and improperly cooked food. 

Second. Scorbutic condition of the blood, scurvy and its various 
manifestations. 

Third. The action of the gases, and especially of sulphureted 
hydrogen and hydro-sulphuret of ammonia, arising from the im- 
mense accumulation of fecal matters. 

Fourth. Reduction of the temperature and of the forces, and 
irregularity induced in the action of the skin and kidneys, by ex- 
posure, without shelter and sufficient covering, to the cold ground 
at night, to dew and rain, and to the hot sun by day. 

Fifth. Suppression to a great extent of the functions of the skin, 
consequent upon the accumulation of dust, smoke, and filth. The 
skin of those prisoners who neglected to bathe at regular intervals 
was so coated with the dust of the ground upon which they lay, 
and with the soot of the burning pine of the innumerable fires 
which they kindled all over the Stockade and Hospital grounds, 
that it resembled more nearly parchment and sand-paper — the 
pores being apparently completely stopped up, and the complexion 
in some cases so blackened that the unfortunate men looked more 
Hke Indians and Negroes than white men. 



^. TREATMENT INEFFICACIOUS. 620 

^v The corn bread baked and issued to the prisoners consisted of 
^Ribolted corn-meal, as did the rations issued generally Effect of 
to the Confederate soldiers ; and the Federals, who were or^boued 
accustomed to wheat bread, could not abide this coarse ^°"^-'^^^- 
corn bread. 

I saw immense piles of this corn bread, both in the Stockade 
and in the Hospital grounds, which had been thrown away by the 
prisoners. 

The husk of the indian corn appeared to exert a decided irri- 
tant effect upon the intestinal canal. 

Amidst the immense mass of human excrement in both localities, 
I did not see a single moulded stool. 

The foul exhalations from the innumerable small sinks and de- 
posits of excrements at the very tent doors, as well as Boweidis- 
from the more extensive deposits in and around the vatedbf'' 
streams, must also without doubt have depressed the tions.

appeared to be very gradual. Patients whose flesh was Ecfectsof

In some cases, when the discharges from the bowels diarrhoea. 
were checked by a change of diet and by opiates, dropsical 
efhisions took place into the abdomen and lower extremities. 

The treatment instituted appeared to have little or no beneficial 
effect, because the necessary diet was not furnished the Treatment 
sick. It was in vain to look for a recovery from chronic ''^^®^^<=^°"^- 
diarrhoea and dysentery when the patients were confined to coarse 
corn-bread, bacon, and beef, and whilst they were suffering with 
scurvy. 

The most efficient treatment of these cases would have been 
with good fresh milk, combined when necessary with lime-water, 
and morphine, with boiled rice and milk, beef tea, chicken soup, 
alcoholic stimulants, tonics (especially the preparations of iron, as 
the sesquichloride), and with antiscorbutics, digestible vegetables, 
Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, vinegar and citric acid, and good 
ripe fruit in moderation. 

I expressed to the medical officers my decided opinion as to the 
worthlessness of remedies without the proper nourishment. 

It is probable that in the majority of the cases of long standing,

of the intestinal mucous membrane in many of these cases ap- 
peared to be similar in its nature, and to be due to the same 
causes, as that form of mortification known as hospital gangrene. 
Existence of I had no doubt of the connection of scurvy with a 
obstinate large uumbcr, if not with all these cases of obstinate 
diarrhoea diarrhoea and dysentery. The existence of this con- 
tery. ncctiou, in the relation of cause and effect, was inferred 

not merely from the actual existence of scurvy, but also from 
the highly important fact that every form of treatment which did 
not include anti-scorbutic remedies, and especially anti-scorbutic 
diet, proved utterly powerless to arrest the disease. No cures of 
these bowel affections were so speedy and effectual as those which 
were effected in the paroled prisoners, who were supplied with 
extra rations, and who were able to purchase vegetables in suf- 
ficient abundance to remove the scorbutic symptoms. 

The dependence of these obstinate diarrhoeas and dysenteries 
upon the scorbutic state of the system, was recognized more tlian 
two centuries ago, and is a fact of vast importance in its relations 
to the hygiene of armies. 

It would appear, however, that the intimate relation between 
the obstinate diarrhoea and dysentery of the camps and scurvy was 
not fully recognized until the comparatively recent operations of 
the French and English armies in the Crimea during the war with 
Russia. 

The admissions into hospital from diseases of the stomach and 
Diseases of howcls (exclusivc of cholcra) in the English army serv- 
iudbowds^ ing in the Crimea, April, 1854- June, 1856, numbered 
irsh^'armrin 55,765', with 5950 deaths ; whilst the primary admissions 
the Crimea. fj-Qj^ ^11 discascs, cxclusive of wouuds and mechanical 
injuries, numbered 142,616, with 16,211 deaths ; of these num- 
bers cholera numbered 7575 cases and 4513 deaths. Of the total 
deaths recorded in the English army during this war, the amazing 
proportion of nearly thirty-three per cent, occurred under the 
class of diseases of the bowels, and these affections rendered in- 
effective twenty per cent, of the men invalided to England. Ex- 
traordinary as this mortality may appear, the manner in which it 



EFFECTS OF IMPROVED RATIONS. 631 

distributed over the different months of the period is still more 
singular, for, of the whole number of deaths returned, 89 per cent, 
occurred from the period which elapsed between the opening of 
the siege on the 1st of October, and the termination of the fol- 
lowing April ; while in the months of December, January, and 
February, taken together, 4145 deatlis occurred, and in January 
alone 2033, the latter in itself constituting a mortality considerably 
greater than was incurred by wounds during the whole term of the 
war. While the mortality caused by this class of affections, in the 
period embraced between the 1st of October and the end of 
April, 1855, was 5301, it amounted during the same months of the 
following year only to 128 ; and whereas, in January, 1855, the 
deaths numbered 2033, they amounted in the same month of the 
following year to 13, though the strength of the army in the latter 
year was twice as great as in the former. 

This marked diminution in the cases of and deaths Diminution 
from diarrhoea and dysentery appeared to be clearly ref- ^LThrre^fe?- 
erable to the improvement of the rations and clothing privement 
of the English soldiers, as w^ell as to modifications of the and cioth- 
asperities of the climate. ^°^' 

In the earlier periods of the war, when the English soldiers were 
imperfectly clothed and fed — 

" It may be asserted that the army, at least the infantry force, repre- 
sented a stricken mass ; there was indeed scarcely a sound man in the 
ranks, with the exception of a small number recently arrived in the 
country. The number admitted represented the capacity of the hospi- 
tals, rather than the necessities of the time ; and if the mortality were 
henceforth excessive, it would be more just to estimate the proportions 
of deaths to strength, than of deaths to admissions, for in fact the men 
in the trenches and daily proceeding on fatigue duty to Balaklava were 
in a great proportion suitable candidates for admission into the hospitals, 
though these establishments could only accommodate the more grave 
forms of disease ; and so great was the pressure that to answer even 
this object it was necessary to discharge men from the wards, while yet 
their ailments were but partially relieved 

" The general appearance of the men indicated that the conditions 
essential to the persistence of human life had been rudely violated ; and 
the scorbutic diathesis and cachectic degeneration were declared in the 
air of apathy and indifference, the emaciation and debility, the murky, 
cloudy aspect and crippled gait, and the appearance of premature de- 
crepitude, which characterized a large proportion of the men. 

" To those, indeed, who at this time were fanuliar with the state of 
the troops, and could clearly appreciate the true etiological relations of 



632 SCORBUTIC DIARRHOEA. 

this condition, it was rather a subject of apprehension that the causes 
which were thus destroying the army might be protracted in their opera- 
tion, yet a little longer in full force, and still further compromise its 
efficiency, than of wonder that the soldier should have succumbed to 
agencies which at once impaired his vigor and deteriorated his blood, 
while the elements of healthy sanguinification were not available. And 
we can declare on our own behalf, and that of the medical officers, that 
it was with deep regret it was observed that the active sympathy of this 
great country was for a time frustrated in its anxiety to discover some 
specific cause, some panacea for the wide-spread suffiiring in the ranks 
of the British soldier. Fully were they convinced that there was noth- 
ing recondite or mysterious in the causes of the frightful losses which 
were being daily incurred, and the result more than justified their con- 
clusions; for when at length the gushing sympathies of the people 
found a proper channel for their expression, and the supplies of cloth- 
ing, bedding, and food so largely provided by the government reached 
the army, the soldier forthwith, under the fostering care of the nation 
(of which there is not on record a grander or more noble instance), ad- 
vanced to a state of high efficiency, and in a few months reached a 
standard of health which it was the more delightful to contemplate as it 
was so unusual, and, in general, so totally unexpected." 

" Scorbutic Diarrhcea. — Having thus referred to the affection as it 
was directly induced by severe exposure to cold and wet, &c., as it oc- 
curred in an atomic state of the system, the result of some wide-spread 
and general influence, depressing agencies, and the nature of the food, 
as the effect of endemic causes in the summer months, and in its con- 
nection with cholera, we shall now, lastly, consider it in its relation to 
the operation of causes still more complicated, and the state of the sys- 
tem which these causes determined. 

" The influence of constant exposure, of night-watching, of insuffi- 
cient sleep, of imperfect, innutritions, and irritant food, of excessive la- 
bor, of lying on the damp ground without sufficient bedding, of tainted 
air, of overcrowding, and an epidemic constitution of the atmosphere, 
was observed when these acted alone, or in certain combinations in the 
occurrence of diarrhoea, etc. ; but their effect was not thus limited by 
their direct operation, for, concurrently with the production of imme- 
diately injurious results, the operation of these agencies served to reduce 
the system, to impair the functions, to vitiate the blood, to lower the 
vitality. Diarrhoea occurring in the pathological state of the system 
thus induced presented important modifications, which were determined 
rather by such state than by any of the individual causes now men- 
tioned, or any combination of them ; and it was, of course, chiefly re- 
marked in men who experienced great hardships, privations, and suffer- 
ings for a considerable period. In this forni of the affection, the patient 
presented himself in a feeble, emaciated state, having previously suffered 



DEPENDENCE OK IMPEOPER FOOD. 633 

from occasional attacks of diarrhoea, and perhaps from other complaints. 
There was loss of appetite, loathing of food, apathy of mind, debility, or 
disinclination for exertion ; the pulse was small, slow, and feeble ; the 
skin was dry and rough, often of a dusky, muddy-brown color, that of 
the abdomen was retracted, covered with dry, hard scales ; the features 
assumed a worn and listless expression ; the face and eyelids Avere 
edematous ; the mucous membrane of the mouth and lips became 
exsanguined ; the legs and feet were generally swollen, and there was 
felt in them a sense of numbness and coldness. The tongue appeared 
large and flabby, or was covered with a slimy mucus, and it was often 
indented by the teeth. The dejections were voided frequently, and 
sometimes with a degree of straining and pain ; they were occasionally 
serous and watery. Sometimes they were of a clay color, or grayish, 
and extremely fetid ; but these last characters usually occurred in the 
worst cases, and those attended with organic lesions. The appearance 
of the bile on the lesions was not constant, and it seemed rather to be 
periodically thrown off as an excretion, than to be expurged as an ele- 
ment which had been applied in the digestive process ; it was seldom 
observed of a depraved quality in the evacuations, except in the com- 
plication of a low adynamic fever, which was by no means an infrecjuent 
occurrence. Notwithstanding the grave nature of the symptoms here 
detailed, diarrhoea was yet, under careful treatment and with suitable 
resources, still a very manageable disease. 

" The scorbutic nature of the affection, when it presented these char- 
acters, was sufficiently apparent. The more distinct evidences of the 
scorbutic taint were livid and swollen gums (bleeding on slight press- 
ure), petechial spots and ulcers on the legs ; patches of ecchymosis on 
the calves of the legs ; listlessness ; dyspnoea on slight exertion ; a feel- 
ing of aching pains in the limbs, with a sense of coldness ; oedema of 
the feet, and sudden hemorrhage from the bowels ; vomiting of blood, 
discharge of blood from the fauces, epistaxis, etc., and occasionally the 
scorbutic nature of the affection was expressed in fatal sinking, and 
effusion into the pericardium or pleurae." ^ 

A large number of important observations are recorded in the 
valuable work just quoted, showing the intimate blend- Dependence 
ing of diarrhoea and dysentery, and the dependence of and dySa*

food and the scorbutic condition of the blood. buticcon!'

applies so correctly to this disease as it prevailed amongst the Fed-

634 EFFECTS OF SALT DIET IN DIARRHCEA. 

and it will be seen in the last chapter of the present inquiries that 
the results of my pathological investigations in diarrhoea and dysen- 
tery agree in the main with the facts recorded by the English sur- 
geons in the Crimea. 

In some instances the scorbutic character of dysentery was so 
marked a feature of it, that the disease was even denominated 
scorbutic by the English surgeons, and the grave nature of the 
complaint as it prevailed in the Crimea is apparent in the fact that 
of the three hundred and ninety-six which were so returned, one 
hundred and sixteen terminated fatally ; and in view of the appall- 
ing mortality which attended dysentery, and the nature of the 
modifications which were imparted to it by the scorbutic taint of 
system in which it occurred, it was admitted by the medical offi- 
cers of the English army that scorbutus was vastly more important 
in connection with this affection than in the extent to which it ex- 
isted as an independent disease. Moreover, the true scorbutic 
nature of these bowel affections was placed beyond doubt in a very 
large proportion of the cases by the requirements of treatment, for 
it was found that this class of diseases often proved obstinate and 
inveterate under the use of all medicines, and only yielded to the 
influence of vegetable acids and a properly adopted diet. 

The effects of salt diet in the production of diarrhoea and dysen- 
Effectsof tery have been conclusively shown in the British navy 
the prodic- ^^^ army by the great diminution of the cases of and deaths 
rh<L,and*^ from thcsc discascs which followed the improvement of 
dysentery. ^^^^ ratious, the iutroductiou of fresh meat and vegetable 
diet, and the diminution of the salt-meat ration. The marked re- 
duction which took place in the deaths from this class of diseases 
subsequent to the introduction of fresh-meat diet has been clearly 
shown by the late Sir Alexander Tulloch in his valuable statistical 
reports. 

Diarrhoea and dysentery have at all times proved severe scourges 
of fleets in active service, and of armies in the field, and of crowded 
filthy prisons with their depressed and poorly-fed inmates, and of 
beleaguered forts and cities. Diarrhoea and dysentery contributed 
largely to the destruction of the British army in Holland in 1748 ; 
they decimated the French, Prussian, and Austrian armies in 
1792 ; they constituted the most fatal disease in the Biitish army 
during the Peninsular War, when with an effective force of 61,500 
men, only 42.4 per 1000 were lost by wounds, while 118.6 were 
lost by disease ; they were the chief cause of death in the ill-fated 
Walcheren expedition in 1809, when the British army, numbering 



DIARRHOEA A:N"D DYSENTERY. 



635 



tO,000, lost 332 in the 1000 by disease, and only 16.7 by wounds ; 
ind these diseases have followed the tracks of all the great armies 
'which have traversed Europe during the continental wars of the 
past two hundred years. 

In the Confederate army, during the first two years of the war, 
1861 and 1862, the whole number of cases exhibited in Prevalence 
the field reports numbered 848,555, with 16,220 deaths, and djse^-* 
and 10,455 discharges ; the admissions into hospitals for co^ufedeiate 
the same period numbered 447,689 cases, of which 19,- the firsuwT 
359 died, and 6485 were discharged ; the cases of diar- wT/.^ ^ 
rhoea and dysentery numbered upon the field reports 226,828, with 
1696 deaths, and upon the hospital reports 86,506 cases, and 1658 
deaths. 

Diarrhoea and dysentery constituted 26.7 per cent, of all cases 
entered upon the field reports, and 19.3 per cent, of the cases ad- 
mitted into the general hospitals, during the first two years of the 
Confederate struo-orle. 

The deaths entered upon the field and hospital reports do not 
represent the entire number caused by diarrhoea and dysentery, 
for a large. number of those suffering from the graver forms of this 
disease were either discharged or sent home on furlough, and sub- 
sequently died. 

The following tables will illustrate the relations (numerical) of 
diarrhoea and dysentery, to several diseases, and to the total cases 
treated in some of the largest hospitals in the Confederate States.

ii: crease of 
diarrhoea 
and dysen- 
tery among 
Confederate 
soldiers dur- 
ing the war, 



* Returns of deaths incomplete. 

t This numher represents the aggregate cases treated for April, and includes the number received during the 
month, 10,970, and the number remaining from last report, 9908. 

In these hospitals, as well as in many others throughout the 
Progressive Confederate States, chronic diarrhoea and dysentery were 
the most abundant and most difficult of cure amongst 
army diseases ; and whilst the more fatal diseases, as 
typhoid fever, progressively diminished, chronic diar- 
rhoea and dysentery progressively increased, and not 
only destroyed more soldiers than gunshot wounds, but more sol- 
diers were permanently disabled and lost to the service from these 
diseases than from the disability following the accidents of battle. 

The cases of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery as they presented 
Character of thcmselvcs in the Confederate hospitals were character- 
chtrgesin ^^cd by frequcnt yellow and dark watery discharges, 
chronic varying in number from four to twelve during the 
aJTd d^len- twcuty-four hours ; in the state in which the patients 
t«ry. were received into the general hospitals, the discharges, 

as a general rule, contained no blood ; but upon inquiry into the 
previous history, it was found that in most cases the disease had 
commenced with dysenteric symptoms, accompanied with straining 
and bloody mucoid discharges, and after a varying period these 
dysenteric evacuations had been replaced by the thin watery dis- 
charges of chronic diarrhoea, unattended with pain or straining. 
The appearance of these patients was highly characteristic, — 
nerveless relaxation, depressed spirits, indisposition to exertion, but 
little apparent vitality, feeble circulation, sunken cheeks and eyes, 



TREATMENT OF DIARRHOEA AND DYSENTERY. 639 



^Bmbs. The most emaciated subjects which I have ever seen were 
these poor soldiers suffering with chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. 
In some cases ulceration of the cornea was observed, generally 

I^Ki the form of a crescentic transparent ulceration of the ulceration 
^Tiower part of the cornea. As a general rule, the disease comea. 
was slow in its progress, the patients at the time of their reception 
ito the various hospitals having suffered with the disease from 
iree to eighteen months. 

In the large majority of cases, the mind continued clear up to 
the moment of death, and the patients retained strength condition of 
sufficient to get up to stool to the close of life. *^^ °'^"^- 

In most cases which I have had an opportunity of examining 
after death extensive ulceration existed in the mucous ulcerations 
membrane of both the colon and rectum, and the small tinaicanai 

.,,.,, . , , found after 

mtestmes, especially m the lower portions toward the death, 
ileo-cfecal valve, were inflamed and greatly congested. The re- 
sults of my post-mortem examinations will be fully given and con- 
sidered in the concluding chapter of these labors upon Anderson- 
ville.i 

In the treatment of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. Surgeon J. 
S. Davis, professor of anatomy and materia medica in the Experience 
University of Virginia, found injections of nitrate of silver jf s^ D^fvrs'in 
to be the most efficacious remedy. The nitrate of silver JJ^^ nitmL 
was employed in the strength of from one half to one o^^i^^®"^- 
grain to each fluid ounce of water or thin starch. 

From six to eight grains of the nitrate of silver was dissolved in 
ten ounces of water, and thrown up into the rectum. After many 
trials it was found that it was impossible to introduce and retain for 
any length of time much more than ten ounces of this solution, 
and this quantity did not appear to reach more than one foot or 
eighteen inches into the colon. 

One drachm of laudanum was generally given with each injec- 
tion, and the hips elevated so as to retain the injection ; and strict 
rest enjoined on the ground that the erect posture caused an inju- 
rious gravitation of the fluids to the diseased structures. 

Post-mortem examinations revealed the interesting result that in 
those cases in which the nitrate of silver had been used, the ulcer- 
ations diminished in number and severity from the rectum upward 
— just the reverse of the condition which existed in those cases in 
which the nitrate had not been used.

640 ANTISCORBUTIC TREATMENT. 

The line to which the nitrate of silver injection had reached 
could be distinguished by a grayish discoloration of the mucous 
membrane. Within the range of the nitrate of silver injections, 
the ulcerations were invariably either healed or greatly improved, 
and it was fair to assume that if it had been possible to throw the 
solution of the nitrate of silver throughout the whole tract of the 
large intestines, all the ulcers would have been cured, and a great 
number of these otherwise incurable cases relieved. 

The results of this mode of treatment of the chronic diarrhoea 
and dysentery of the camps, even with the impossibility of intro- 
ducing the solution of nitrate of silver high up into the bowels, were 
considered most satisfactory by Dr. Davis. 

According to this view, the chronic diarrhoea and dysentery of 
the camps is a local affection ; and in fact Dr. Davis did not adopt 
the view that this disease was due in a considerable number of 
cases to a scorbutic condition of the system. 

It does not appear by a comparison of the statistics of the Gen- 
eral Hospital of Charlottesville that there was any material dimi- 
nution of the mortality after the institution of this mode of treat- 
ment, or that this hospital exhibits a smaller rate of mortality than 
many other Confederate hospitals.

cinai. some surgcous, that the cure ot the disease depended 

more upon the diet than upon the medicines employed. When 
sent to private quarters and abandoned simply to the kind attention 
of friends, with little or no treatment beyond domestic remedies 
and good diet, and an abundance of fresh eggs and milk, the re- 
sults were most happy, and many soldiers recovered from chronic 
diarrhoea and dysentery, who to all appearances would have died 
if kept in the hospitals. It is probable that almost every case of 
chronic diarrhoea and dysentery from the camps, which had not 
extensive ulceration and destruction of the mucous membrane of 
the colon and rectum, would have been greatly benefited and cured 
by the proper diet. 

The great fact that diarrhoea and dysentery arise and prevail 
with fatal effect whenever the food is diminished in quantity and 
deteriorated in quality, as happens universally in times of scarcity 
and famine, in beleagured forts and cities, and to a greater or less 
extent in all armies, should excite the attention of medical officers

the treatment of these diseases in the camp, and should cause 
them to direct their most strenuous efforts primarily to the diet of 
the well and of those actually laboring under these great scourges 
of armies. 

In this and in the preceding chapter we have presented facts to 
show that these diseases are to be attributed in their Diarrhoea 
origin and spread, to a comparatively small extent,, to ^ryav^ded 
the exhalations arising from human excrements and ciotmn?'^ 
decomposing animal matters. The w^ell-clothed army, ^^'I'li^t. 
supplied with a sufficient variety of vegetable and animal food, 
will, as a general rule, escape the desolating effects of diarrhoea 
and dysentery, under almost every circumstance of perfect and 
imperfect hygiene. In the Confederate army, as has been the 
case in all other armies, those companies and regiments exhibited 
the smallest mortality, and especially from such diseases as diar- 
rhoea and dysentery and pneumonia, which were most carefully 
clothed and fed by their officers. 

Whilst it is difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the introduc- 
tion and spread, amongst recruits and newly raised armies, of 
typhoid fever and measles, much may be done to prevent the 
origin and spread of diarrhoea and dysentery by careful attention 
to the clothing and diet of the men. When the muscular and 
nervous forces have been depressed, the digestion impaired, the 
blood impoverished and radically altered in its constitution and 
relations, and the whole chemistry and nutrition of the system 
perverted by insufficient and improper food, it is impossible to pre- 
vent the appearance and spread of diarrhoea and dysentery by any 
mere police arrangements ; and it is equally impossible to check 
their increase in the army, or to control their ravages in the 
hospital amongst the sick, without the most scrupulous attention to 
the food and diet. In the treatment of these diseases, attention to 
the diet of the well and of the sick should be the first and the last 
care of the surgeon ; for it often happens, as we have shown in 
the case of the English army in the Crimea, that the constitutions 
of the men are slowly, and imperceptibly almost, undermined by 
exposure and bad diet, so that when the system most nearly con- 
nected with assimilation, and consequently with the preservation 
of the health and strength, gives way, the ruin of the army is 
speedy and all but irremediable.

CHAPTER NINTH. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. 

General Conclusions drawn from the Preceding Investigations upon the Diseases of the 
Federal Prisoners confined at AndersonvUle. 

I. The great mortality amongst the Federal prisoners confined 
in the Military Prison at AndersonvUle was not referable to climatic 
causes, or to the nature of the soil and waters. 

The Confederate States Military Prison at Camp Sumpter was 
located by the Confederate authorities in an elevated, dry, and 
healthy region, supplied with pure and wholesome water. 

The effects of malaria, which acts with greater or less intensity, 
according to the character of the soil, the elevation of the coun- 
try, and the presence or absence of marshes and swamps, and ac- 
cording to the season and temperature and the amount of rain and 
of moisture in the atmosphere, throughout the entire belt of the 
Southern Atlantic and Gulf States, appear in the case of these pris- 
oners to have been neutralized to a great extent by the artificial 
atmosphere generated within the crowded Stockade and Hospital. 

II. Not only were malarial fevers of infrequent occurrence 
amongst the Federal prisoners, hut typhoid fever was rare, and 
typhus fever was unknown. 

The Confederate guard camped around the Military Prison and 
Hospital suffered much more heavily both from malarial and 
typhoid fevers. I observed a number of severe cases of genuine 
typhoid fever amongst the Confederate reserves, composed almost 
entirely of recruits — boys and old men ; whilst on the other hand, 
I did not observe a single case of either typhoid or typhus fever 
amongst the Federal prisoners. Amongst the Confederate troops 
in all parts of the Southern Confederacy, typhoid fever prevailed 
to the greatest extent in the earliest periods of the war and 
amongst the recruits who had never before seen service, and 
especially amongst the recruits from the country. As the war 
progressed this disease gradually disappeared from amongst the 
veterans, and its prolonged existence in the army appeared to be 
due to the constant addition of fresh recruits. 



CAUSES OF TYPHUS FEVER, ETC. 643 

The infrequent occurrence of typhoid fever amongst these Fed- 
eral prisoners, notwithstanding the existence of all the causes 
which are so dogmatically affirmed by a host of writers to be suf- 
ficient and essential to the development and rapid spread of this 
disease, may be explained by the fact that these prisoners had been 
long in confinement, and had probably passed through the diseases 
incident to camps and prisons, and the majority had had typhoid 
fever (which, as a general rule, attacks but once during a lifetime) 
before coming to Andersonville. 

Here we have in the dirty tents and mud hovels, and crowded, 
filthy condition of the prisoners, in an atmosphere loaded with the 
foul exhalations of human excrements, fermentation of bread, and 
all other imaginable kinds of filth, all the apparent conditions for 
the generation of typhus fever, and of all the various contagious 
fevers. But still typhus fever was absent; and this disease had 
prevailed neither in the Confederate nor in the Federal armies 
and military prisons. The absence of typhus fever, notwithstand- 
ing the existence of eveiy circumstance — as filth, bad diet, 
crowding, mental depression, bad and scant food, which has been 
declared as sufficient to cause its generation — would seem to 
show that the conditions for the origin of this disease are not so 
defined and well known as many writers w^oald make them to 
appear by dogmatical assertions and superficial reasoning. This 
great experiment of Andersonville, perhaps the greatest and most 
remarkable of modern times, strongly sustains the view that 
typhus and typhoid fevers are dependent upon the action of 
special poisons, the conditions for the origin and action of which 
are as definite and as limited as in the case of the poisons of small- 
pox and measles. It would appear from the results of the experi- 
ment of Andersonville, as well as from the large number of well 
established facts presented during the course of the present in- 
quiry, that neither typhoid nor typhus fevers can be generated by 
animal exhalations from putrefying excrements or bodies ; but that 
these diseases are propagated by a special poison emitted by the 
living body, either directly or through the excretions and secre- 
tions. Thus, if the excrements from a person suffering with typhoid 
fever are capable of communicating the disease, they do so not in 
virtue of any decomposition set up in them after their removal 
from the body, but in virtue of the presence of the poison received 
from the living body. According to this view, the excrements 
trom the diseased bowels of the typhoid patient resemble in their 
contagious power the poisonous secretions and scabs of the skin of 



644 CHIEF CAUSES OF DEATH. 

the small-pox patient. However, whilst admitting that there is 
nothing unreasonable in the supposition that typhoid fever may be 
})ropagated through the matters thrown off from the diseased 
bowels, at the same time we are constrained to acknowledge that 
there are no experiments to prove that the excrements of typhoid 
fever will generate the disease if transported to a perfectly healthy 
locality, and allowed to contaminate a certain definite confined 
portion of air inhabited by healthy individuals, not otherwise ex- 
posed to the poison of typhoid fever. 

The absence of typhus fever from the Confederate armies and 
prisoners would seem to sustain the view that this disease does not 
arise de novo^ but must be imported from some existing source of 
infection, as from those great places of its permanent abode, the 
mud-hovels and crowded cities of Europe, and especially of Ireland 
and Hungary. Whilst certain circumstances favor the rapid 
spread of typhus and typhoid fevers, when once introduced, it is 
illogical and erroneous to assign those conditions without absolute 
experimental proof, as the causes for the origin of these diseases de 
novo. 

III. The chief causes of death amongst the Federal prisoners of 
Andersonville were scurvy and its results, and bowel affections, 
chronic and acute diarrhoea and dysentery. 

Notwithstanding the exposure of these prisoners without shel- 
ter, the diseases referable more directly to this cause, as pneu- 
monia, bronchitis, catarrh, and rheumatism, did not prevail to a 
greater extent amongst the Federal prisoners than amongst the 
Confederate soldiers in the field, who were in like manner exposed 
to the cold of winter and the heat of summer, without tents, and 
without any other shelter than that which they were able to con- 
struct with their hands. 

IV. The effects of salt meat and of farinaceous food without fresh 
vegetables, were manifested in the great prevalence of scurvy. 

The scorbutic condition thus induced, modified the course of 
every disease, poisoned every wound, however slight, and lay at 
the foundation of those obstinate and exhausting diarrhoeas and 
dysenteries which swept off thousands of these unfortunate men. 

The Federal prisoners received the same rations in kind, quality, 
and amount issued to the Confederate soldiers in the field. These 
rations were insufficient, and without that variety of fresh meat and 
vegetables which would ward off scurvy from soldiers as well as 
prisoners. 



EFFECTS OF CONFEDERATE RATIONS. 645 

As far as my experience extended, no body of troops could be 
confined exclusively to the Confederate ration without suffering 
materially in their health, and without manifesting symptoms 
of the scurvy. The Confederate ration grew Avorse and worse 
as the war progressed, and as portion after portion of the most 
fertile regions of the Confederate States were overrun and dev- 
astated by the Federal armies. In the straitened condition of 
the Confederate States, the support of an army of fifty thousand 
prisoners, forced upon their hands by a relentless policy, was a 
great and distressing burden, which consumed their scant resources 
and exhausted their over-taxed energies. It M'-as the belief of the 
army as well as of the people, that the Confederate government 
not only earnestly desired the exchange of all prisoners of war in 
their hands, but also that the Confederate authorities charged with 
the exchange of prisoners had used every effort in their power, 
consistent with their views of national honor and rectitude, to 
effect an exchange of all prisoners in their hands, and to establish 
definite rules by which all prisoners of war might be continuously 
exchanged as soon as possible after capture. Whatever the feel- 
ings of resentment on the part of the Confederates may have been 
against those who were invading and desolating their native land, 
which had been purchased by the blood of their ancestors from the 
Indians and English, the desire for the speedy exchange and re- 
turn of the great army of veterans held captive in Northern pris- 
ons, was earnest and universal ; and this desire for speedy and 
continuous exchange on the part of the government as well as on 
the part of the people, sprang not merely from motives of com- 
passion for their unfortunate kindred and fellow-soldiers, but also 
from the dictates of that policy which would exchange on the 
part of a weak and struggling people a large army of prisoners 
(consumers and non-combatants, requiring an army for their 
guard) for an army of tried veterans. Apart from the real facts 
of the case, it is impossible to conceive that any government in the 
distressed and struggling state of the Confederate States could de- 
liberately advocate any policy which would deprive it of a large 
army of veterans, and compel it to waste its scant supplies, already 
insufficient for the support of its struggling and retreating armies, 
upon an immense number of prisoners. And, as the result has 
shown, the destruction of the Confederate government was ac- 
complished as much by the persistent retention in captivity of 
the Confederate soldiers, as by the emancipation and arming of the 
slaves. 



646 DEPRAVATIO:Nr OF THE BLOOD. 

V. From the sameness of the food^ and from the action of the 
poisonous gases in the densely crowded and filthy Stockade and Hos- 
2)ital, the hlood was altered in its constitution, even before the mani- 
festation of actual disease. 

In both the well and the sick, the red corpuscles were dimin- 
ished ; and in all diseases uncomplicated with inflammation, the 
fibrinous element was deficient. In cases of ulceration of the mu- 
cous membrane of the intestinal canal, the fibrinous element of the 
blood appeared to be increased ; whilst in simple diarrhoea, uncom- 
plicated with ulceration, and dependent upon the character of the 
food and the existence of scurvy, it was either diminished or re- 
mained stationary. Heart clots were very common, if not univer- 
sally present, in the cases of ulceration of the intestinal mucous 
membrane ; whilst in the uncomplicated cases of diarrhoea and 
scurvy the blood was fluid and did not coagulate readily, and the 
heart clots and fibrinous concretions were almost universally absent. 

From the watery condition of the blood, there resulted various 
serous eifusions into the pericardium, into the ventricles of the 
brain, and into the abdominal cavity. 

In almost all the cases which I examined after death, even in 
the most emaciated, there was more or less serous effusion into the 
abdominal cavity. 

In cases of hospital gangrene of the extremities, and in cases of 
gangrene of the intestines, heart clots and firm coagula were uni- 
versally present. The presence of these clots, in the cases of hos- 
pital gangrene, whilst they were absent in the cases in which there 
were no inflammatory symptoms, appears to sustain the conclusion 
that hospital gangrene is a species of inflammation (imperfect and 
irregular though it may be in its progress), in which the fibrinous 
element and coagulability of the blood are increased, even in those 
who are suffering from such a condition of the blood and from 
such diseases as are naturally accompanied with a decrease in the 
fibrinous constituent. 

VI. The impoverished condition of the hlood, which led to serous 
effusions within the ventricles of the brain, and around the brain and 
spinal cord, and into the pericardial and abdominal cavities, was 
gradually induced by the action of several causes, but chiefly by the 
character of the food. 

The Federal prisoners, as a general rule, had been reared upon 
wheat bread and Irish potatoes ; and the indian corn, so exten- 
sively used at the South, was almost unknown to them as an article 



h 



STARVATION UPON CORN-MEAL. 647 



of diet previous to their capture. Owing to the impossibility of 

tbtaining the necessary sieves in the Confederacy for the separa- 
Lon of the husk from the corn-meal, the ration^ of the Confeder- 
te soldiers, as well as of the Federal prisoners, consisted of un- 
bolted corn-flour and meal and grist : this circumstance rendered 
the corn-bread still more disagreeable and distasteful to the Fed- 
eral prisoners. Whilst Indian meal, even when prepared with the 
Irusk, is one of the most wholesome and nutritious forms of food, 
as has been clearly shown by the health and rapid increase of the 
Southern population, and especially of the Negroes, previous to 
the present war, and by the strength, endurance, and activity of 
the Confederate soldiers, who were throughout the war confined 
to a great extent to unbolted corn-meal, it is nevertheless true 
that those who have not been reared upon corn-meal, or who have 
not accustomed themselves to its use gradually, become excessively 
tired of this kind of diet when suddenly confined to it without a 
due proportion of wheat bread. Large numbers of the Federal 
prisoners appeared to be utterly disgusted with Indian corn, and 
immense piles of corn-bread could be seen in the Stockade and 
Hospital inclosures. Those who were so disgusted with this form 
of food that they had no appetite to partake of it, except in quan- 
tities insufficient to supply the waste of the tissues, were of course 
in the condition of men slowly starving, notwithstanding that the 
only farinaceous form of food which the Confederate States pro- 
duced in sufficient abundance for the maintenance of armies was 
not withheld from them. In such cases, an urgent feeling of 
hunger was not a prominent symptom, and even when it existed 
at first, it soon disappeared, and was succeeded by an actual loath- 
ing of food. In this state the muscular strength was rapidly 
diminished, the tissues wasted, and the thin, skeleton-like forms 
moved about with the appearance of utter exhaustion and dejec- 
tion. The mental condition connected with long confinement, 
with the most miserable surroundings, and with no hope for the 
future, also depressed all the nervous and vital actions, and was 
especially active in destroying the appetite. The effects of mental 
depression and of defective nutrition, was manifested not only in 
the slow, feeble motions of the wasted, skeleton-hke forms, but also 
in such lethargy, listlessness, and torpor of the mental faculties as 
rendered these unfortunate men oblivious and indifferent to their 
afflicted condition. In many cases even of the greatest apparent 
suffering and distress, instead of showing any anxiety to communi- 
cate the causes of their distress, or to relate their privations and 



648 CONDITIOl^S FAVORABLE TO FEVER POISONS. 

their longings for their homes and their friends and relatives, they 
lay in a listless, lethargic, uncomplaining state, taking no notice 
either of their own distressed condition or of the gigantic mass of 
hmnan misery by which they were surrounded. Nothing appalled 
and depressed me so much as this silent, uncomplaining misery. 

It is a fact of great interest, that notwithstanding this defective 
nutrition in men subjected to crowding and filth, contagious fevers 
were rare ; and typhus fever, which is supposed to be generated in 
just such a state of things as existed at Andersonville, was un- 
known. These facts, established by my investigations, stand in 
striking contrast with such a statement as the following by a recent 
English writer : — 

"A deficiency of food, especially of the nitrogenous part, quickly 
leads to the breaking up of the animal frame. Plague, pestilence, and 
famine are associated with each other in the public mind, and the rec- 
ords of every country show how closely they are related. The medical 
history of Ireland is remarkable for the illustrations of how much mis- 
chief may be occasioned by a general deficiency of food. Always the 
habitat of fever, it every now and then becomes the very hotbed of its 
propagation and development. Let there be but a small failure in the 
usual imperfect supply of food, and the lurking seeds of pestilence are 
ready to burst into frightful activity. The famine of the present cent- 
ury is but too forcible an illustration of this. It fostered epidemics 
which had not been witnessed in this generation, and gave rise to 
scenes of devastation and misery which are not surpassed by the most 
appalling epidemics of the Middle Ages. The principal form of the 
scourge was known as the contagious famine fever (typhus), and it 
spread, not merely from end to end of the country in which it had 
originated, but, breaking through all boundaries, it crossed the broad 
ocean, and made itself painfully manifest in localities where it was pre- 
viously unknown. Thousands fell under the virulence of its action, for 
wherever it came, it struck down a seventh of the people, and of those 
whom it attacked one out of nine perished. Even those who escaped 
the fatal influence of it, were left the miserable victims of scurvy and 
low fever." 

Whilst we readily admit that famine induces that state of the 
system which is most susceptible to the action of fever poisons, 
and thus induces the state of the entire population which is most 
favorable for the rapid and destructive spread of all contagious 
fevers, at the same time we are forced by the facts established by 
the present war, as well as by a host of others, both old and new, 
to admit that we are still ignorant of the causes necessary for the 
origin of typhus fever. 



SCURVY THE CAUSE OF NINE TENTHS OF DEATHS. 649 

Added to the imperfect nature of the rations issued to the Fed- 
.'al prisoners, the difficulties of their situation were at times 
greatly increased by the sudden and desolating Federal raids in 
Virginia, Georgia, and other States, which necessitated the sudden 
transportation from Richmond and other points threatened of large 
bodies of prisoners, without the possibility of much previous prep- 
aration ; and not only did these men suffer much in transition upon 
the dilapidated and overburdened hne of railroad communication, 
but, after arriving at Andersonville, the rations were frequently 
insufficient to supply the sudden addition of several thousand men. 
And as the Confederacy became more and more pressed, and when 
powerful hostile armies were plunging through her bosom, the 
Federal prisoners of Andersonville suffered incredibly during the 
hasty removals to Millen, Savannah, Charleston, and other points 
supposed at the time to be secure from the enemy. 

Each one of these causes must be weighed when an attempt is 
made to estimate the unusual mortality amongst these prisoners of 
war. 

VII. Scurvy^ arising from sameness of food and imperfect nutri- 
tion^ caused^ either directly or indirectly^ nine tenths of the deaths 
amongst the Federal prisoners at Andersonville. 

Not only were the deaths referred to unknown causes, to apo- 
plexy, to anasarca, and to debility traceable to scurvy and its 
effects ; and not only was the mortality in small-pox, pneumonia, 
and typhoid fever, and in all acute diseases, more than doubled by 
the scorbutic taint, but even those all but universal and deadly 
bowel affections arose from the same causes, and derived their 
fatal character from the same conditions which produced the 
scurvy. 

In truth these men at Andersonville were in the condition of 
a crew at sea, confined upon a foul ship upon salt meat and un- 
varying food, and without fresh vegetables. Not only so, but 
these unfortunate prisoners were like men forcibly confined and 
crowded upon a ship tossed about on a stormy ocean, without a 
rudder, without a compass, without a guiding star, and without 
any apparent boundary or end to their voyage ; and they reflected, 
in their steadily increasing miseries, the distressed condition and 
waning fortunes of a devastated and bleeding country which was 
compelled, in justice to her own unfortunate sons,, to hold these 
men in this most distressing captivity. 

I saw nothing in the scurvy which prevailed so universally at 



650 CHARACTERISTICS, ETC., OF BOWEL AFFECTIONS. 

Andersonville at all different from this disease as described by- 
various standard writers ; the mortality was no greater than that 
which has afflicted a hundred ships upon long voyages, and it did 
not exceed the mortahty which has, upon more than one occasion, 
and in a much shorter period of time, annihilated large armies, 
and desolated beleaguered cities. 

VIII. The howel affections^ which were classed under the heads of 
diarrhoea and dysentery^ were due to several causes^ hut chiefly to the 
same causes which induced the scurvy ; and these diseases were ac- 
companied with 'profound lesions of the intestinal mucous membrane 
located more especially in the ileum, colon, and rectum ; and these 
lesions were characterized chiefly hy thickening and softening of the 
mucous membrane, congestion and enlargement of the villi, intense 
congestion of the tubular glands, attended with hemorrhage, intense 
congestion and ulceration of the lower portion of the ileum and of the 
colon and rectum. 

Ulceration of the lower portions of the bowels existed in chronic 
diarrhoea as well as in dysentery ; and in fact the diarrhoea ap- 
peared in many cases to be dependent upon the ulcerations of the 
ileum, colon, and rectum. The division of the cases into chronic 
diarrhoea and dysentery appeared to be arbitrary in most cases ; 
for the two diseases were intimately blended, and appeared to 
depend upon the same causes and lesions. 

The general results of my investigations upon the chronic diar- 
rhoea and dysentery of the Federal prisoners of Andersonville, 
were similar to those of the English surgeons during the war 
against Russia.^ 

IX. Drugs exercised hut little influence over the progress and fatal 
termination of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery in the Military 
Prison and Hospital at Andersonville, chiefly because the proper 
form of noiirishment (niilk, rice, vegetables, anti-scorbutics, and 
nourishing animal and vegetable soups') was not issued, and could 
not he procured in sufficient quantities for these sick prisoners. 

Opium allayed pain and checked the bowels temporarily, but the 
frail dam was soon swept away, and the patient appeared to be but 
little better, if not the worse, for this merely palliative treatment. 

The root of the difficulty could not be reached by drugs ; 
nothing short of the wanting elements of nutrition would have

ORIGIN OF HOSPITAL GANGRENE. 651 

tended in any manner to restore the tone of the digestive system, 
and of all the wasted and degenerated organs and tissues. My 
opinion to this effect was expressed most decidedly to the medical 
officers in charge of these unfortunate men. 

The correctness of this view was sustained by the healthy and 
robust condition of the paroled prisoners, who received an extra 
ration, and who were able to make considerable sums by trading, 
and who supplied themselves with a varied and liberal diet. 

In addition to the facts already presented in a former portion of 
these investigations, we will present two other remarkable exam- 
ples of the effects of an insufficient supply of food.^ 

X. The fact that hospital gangrene appeared in the Stockade 
first, and 07'iginated spontaneously without any previous contagion, 
and occurred sporadically all over the Stockade and Prison Hospital, 
was proof positive that this disease ivill arise whenever the conditions 
of crowding, filth, foul air, and had diet are present. 

The exhalations from the Hospital and Stockade appeared to 
exert their effects to a considerable distance outside of these 
localities. The origin of gangrene amongst these prisoners ap- 
peared clearly to depend in great measure upon the state of the 
general system, induced by diet, exposure, neglect . of personal 
cleanliness, and by various external noxious influences. The 
rapidity of the appearance and action of the gangrene depended 
upon the powers and state of the constitution, as well as upon the 
intensity of the poison in the atmosphere, or upon the direct appli- 
cation of poisonous matter to the wounded surface. This was ftir- 
ther illustrated by the important fact, that hospital gangrene, or a 
disease resembling this form of gangrene, attacked the intestinal 
canal of patients laboring under ulceration of the bowels, although 
there were no local manifestations of gangrene upon the surface 
of the body. This mode of termination in cases of dysentery was 
quite common in the foul atmosphere of the Confederate States 
Mihtary Prison Hospital, and in the depressed, depraved condition 
of the system of these Federal prisoners. Death ensued very rap- 
idly after the gangrenous state of the intestines was established. 

XI. A scorbutic condition of the system appeared to favor the 
origin of foul ulcers, which frequently took on true hospital gan- 
grene. 

Scurvy and hospital gangrene frequently existed in the same in-

bank Penitentiary, is omitted. — Editor. 



652 SCORBUTIC ULCERS. 

dividual. In such cases vegetable diet, with vegetable acids, would 
remove the scorbutic condition witliout curing the hospital gan- 
grene. From the observations recorded by Sir Gilbert Blane, Dr. 
Trotter, and others, which we presented in the ninth chapter, it 
appears tliat the scorbutic condition of the system, especially in 
crowded camps, ships, hospitals, and beleaguered cities, is most 
favorable to the spread and origin of foul ulcers and hospital gan- 
grene. In many cases occurring amongst tlie Federal prisoners at 
Andersonville, it was difficult to decide at first whether the ulcer 
was a simple result of the scorbutic state or of the action of the 
poison of hospital gangrene, for there was a great similarity in the 
appearance of scorbutic ulcers and genuine hospital gangrene. So 
commonly have these two diseases been combined, that the de- 
scription of scorbutic ulcers by many authors evidently .includes 
also many of the prominent characteristics of hospital gangrene, as 
will be seen by a reference to the observations of Lind, Trotter, 
Blane, and others, already given in the ninth chapter. 

Scurvy consists not only in an alteration in the constitution of 
the blood, which leads to passive hemorrhages from the bowels, and 
the effusion into the various tissues of a deeply-colored fibrinous 
exudation ; but, as we have conclusively shown by post-mortem ex- 
aminations, 'this state is also attended with profound alterations in 
the appearance and consistence of the muscles of the heart, and of 
the mucous membrane of the ahmentary canal, and of the solid 
parts generally. We have, according to the extent of the defi- 
ciency of certain articles of food, every degree of scorbutic de- 
rangement, from the most fearful depravation of the blood and the 
perversion of every function subserved by the blood, to those slight 
derangements which are scarcely distinguishable from a state of 
health. 

We are as yet ignorant of the true nature of the changes of the 
blood and tissues in scurvy, and a wide field for investigation is 
open for the determination of the characteristic changes — phys- 
ical, chemical, and physiological — of the blood and tissues, and of 
the secretions and excretions in scurvy. Such inquiries would be 
of great value in their bearing upon the origin of hospital gangrene. 
Up to the present war, the results of chemical investigations upon 
the pathology of the blood in scurvy were not only contradictory, 
but meagre and wanting in that careful detail of the cases fi'om 
which the blood was abstracted which would enable us to explain 
the cause of the apparent discrepancies in different analyses. Thus 
it is not yet settled whether the fibrin is increased or diminished in 



PROPAGATION OF GANGRENE. 653 

lis disease ; and the differences whicli exist in the statements of 
different writers appear to be referable to the neglect of a critical 
examination and record of all the symptoms of the cases from which 
the blood was abstracted. The true nature of the changes of the 
blood in scurvy can be established only by numerous analyses dur- 
ing different stages of the disease, and followed up by carefully 
performed and recorded post-mortem examinations. With such data 
we could settle such important questions as whether the increase 
of fibrin in scurvy was invariably dependent upon some local in- 
flammation. 

XII. Crangrenous spots, followed hy rapid destruction of tissue^ 
appeared in some eases in which there had been no previous or exist- 
ing ivound or abrasion ; and, without such well-established facts, it 
might be assumed that the disease iv as propagated from one patient to 
another in every case, either by exhalations from the gangrenous 
surface, or by direct contact. 

In such a filthy and crowded hospital as that of the Confederate 
States Military Prison of Camp Sumpter, Andersonville, it was 
impossible to isolate the wounded from the sources of actual con- 
tact of the gangrenous matter — the flies swarming over the 
wounds and over filth of every description ; the filthy, imperfectly 
washed, and scanty rags ; the limited number of sponges and Avash- 
bowls (the same wash-bowl and sponge serving for a score or more 
of patients), were one and all sources of such constant circula- 
tion of the gangrenous matter, that the disease might rapidly be 
propagated from a single gangrenous wound. Whilst the fact 
already considered, that a form of moist gangrene, resembling 
hospital gangrene, was quite common in this foul atmosphere, in 
cases of dysentery, both with and without the existence of hospital 
gangrene upon the surface, demonstrates the dependence of the 
disease upon the state of the constitution, and proves in a clear 
manner that neither the contact of the poisonous matter of gan- 
grene, nor the direct action of the poisoned atmosphere upon 
the ulcerated surface is necessary to the development of the dis- 
ease ; on the other hand, it is equally well established that the 
disease may be communicated by the various ways just mentioned. 
It is impossible to determine the length of time which rags and 
clothing saturated with gangrenous matter will retain the power 
of reproducing the disease when applied to healthy wounds. Pro- 
fessor Brugmans, as quoted by Guthrie in his " Commentaries on 
the Surgery of the War in Portugal, Spain, France, and the 



654 ACCIDENTS FOLLOWING VACCINATION. 

Netherlands," says, that in 1797, in Holland, charpie, composed of 
linen threads cut of different lengths, which on inquiry it was 
found had been already used in the great hospitals in France, and 
had been subsequently washed and bleached, caused every ulcer to 
which it was applied to be affected by hospital gangrene. Guthrie 
affirms in the same work, that the fact that this disease was readily 
communicated by the application of instruments, lint, or bandages 
which had been in contact with infected parts, was too firmly 
established by the experience of every one in Portugal and Spain 
to be a matter of doubt. 

There are facts to show that flies may be the means of communi- 
cating malignant pustules. Dr. Wagner, who has related several 
cases of malignant pustule produced in man and beasts, both by con- 
tact and by eating the flesh of diseased animals, which happened 
in the village of Striesa in Saxony in 1834, gives two very remark- 
able cases, which occurred eight daj's after any beast had been 
affected with the disease. Both were women, one of twenty-six, 
and the other of fifty years, and in them the pustules were well 
marked, and the general symptoms similar to the other cases. The 
latter patient said she had been bitten by a fly upon the back of the 
neck, at which part the carbuncle appeared ; and the former that 
she also had been bitten on the right upper arm by a gnat. Upon 
inquiry, Wagner found that the skin of one of the infected beasts 
had been hung on a neighboring wall, and thought it very possible 
that the insects might have been attracted to them by the smell, 
and had thence conveyed the poison. 

XIII. The unfortunate accidents which followed vaccination in 
certain cases, were referable chiefly to the scorbutic state of the 
patients^ and the tendency of all abrasions and wounds^ however 
slight, to assume gangrenous ulceration. 

The charge that the Confederate surgeons willfully introduced 
poisonous vaccine matter into the arms of these prisoners, was as 
malicious as it was false. In every collection of officers and men 
it may be possible to find some unprincipled individual ; and I can- 
not say that the Confederate officers of Andersonville formed an 
exception to the general frailties of mankind ; but this I do know, 
by personal observation, that they deplored the distressing fate of 
these unfortunate victims to a relentless policy, and earnestly de- 
sired to do their duty in the cause of suffering humanity. 

XIV. In the depraved condition of these prisoners^ and in the 



AMPUTATION FAILED TO ARREST GANGRENE. 655 

roul atmosphere of the Military Prison Hospital of Andersonville, 
amputation did not arrest hospital gangrene; the disease almost 
invariably returned. 

Almost every amputation was followed finally by death, either 
fi'om the effects of gangrene, or from the prevailing diarrhoea and 
dysentery. 

Nitric acid and local applications generally, in this crowded at- 
mosphere, loaded with noxious effluvia, exerted only a temporary 
effect ; the gangrene would frequently return with redoubled 
energy after its application ; and even after the gangrene had been 
entirely removed by local and constitutional treatment, it would 
return and destroy the patient. The progress of the cases of 
amputation was frequently very deceptive : I have observed after 
death the most extensive disorganization of the structures of the 
stump, when durhig life there was but little swelKng, and the 
patient was apparently doing well. 

Great as the rate of mortality from hospital gangrene appears 
to be amongst these Federal prisoners, it was equaled by the mor- 
tality from this disease before its treatment was well known, and 
when, as in the present instance, the medical officers did not have 
the necessary medicines and diet. The truth of this assertion will 
be readily comprehended by the following document given by 
Guthrie in his Commentaries : —

PEARED AT THE HOSPITAL STATIONS ON THE PENINSULA, BETWEEN THE 21siT

It will be seen from this return that five hundred and twelve 
deaths occurred amongst the British wounded during this short 
period, and near one third of all the cases of hospital gangrene 
occurring in the hospital stations on the Peninsula died.
