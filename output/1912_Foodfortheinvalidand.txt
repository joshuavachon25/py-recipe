PREFACE 

Grateful acknowledgments are due to 
Dr. Theodore C. Janeway, Dr. H. 0. Mosen- 
thal, Dr. L. R. Williams, and Dr. Edwards 
A. Park, for helpful advice in preparing 
this little book. The work was undertaken 
at the request of the above physicians, and 
to its preparation were brought the results 
of five years' experience as Dietitian for 
the New York Association for Improving 
the Condition of the Poor. During this 
time the working basis has been actual 
incomes of actual families in relation to 
the current prices of foodstuffs. 

The writer has found that much can be 
accomplished in the way of prevention of 
disease by instruction in the very simplest 
laws of right feeding and good cooking. 

The dietaries are reproduced from a for- 
mer pamphlet, "Lessons in the Proper 
Feeding of the Family."

to Miss Fannie M. Farmer, from whose 

writings I adapt many points for use in 

this work.

INTRODUCTION 

Every dispensary physician who is truly 
interested in the care of his patients real- 
izes how important a contributing factor in 
much of the ill-health that he sees is the 
unintelligently chosen and badly prepared 
food of the patients, and what a beneficial 
factor simple and properly cooked meals 
might be in the treatment of many dis- 
orders. The social worker sees in addition 
the economic waste which lack of knowl- 
edge and dietetic prejudice bring into just 
those families of the American community 
that can least afford any waste. This little 
book, prepared by Miss Winifred Stuart 
Gibbs, with the cooperation of Dr. Edwards 
A. Park and Dr. Herman 0. Mosenthal of 
the Department of Medicine of the Vander- 
bilt Clinic, aims to help both physicians 
and social workers in their efforts to treat 
disease and to conserve health. It has 



X INTRODUCTION 

been compiled especially with a view toward 
helping us, the physicians of the Vanderbilt 
Clinic, in carrying on intelligent dietetic 
treatment; and it will, I trust, prove of 
service to dispensary workers generally. 
By means of the book, Miss Gibbs has added 
another strong link to the chain that is 
binding physicians and social workers in 
a cooperation which is rapidly transform- 
ing for the better the spirit and methods 
of American dispensaries.

FOOD FOE THE INVALID AND 
THE CONVALESCENT 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

"2-7 £6 I 
HOW TO BUY 

It is not necessary to buy the most ex- 
pensive food in order to get the best; the 
important thing is to get the right food, so 
that the money spent will give as much 
strength as possible. 

Always buy a fixed quantity of any food, 
instead of " five cents' worth " or " ten cents' 
worth " ; in this way every penny will bring 
in a penny's worth of food. In other words, 
ask for "a half pound" or "a quarter 
pound," " a quart," u a peck," or a * bushel." 

Preservation of Food that Spoils 
Food is preserved in several ways — 

1. By sugar. Example : Fruit preserves. 

2. By drying. Example : Dried apples. 

3. By salt. Example : Salt fish. 

4. By chemicals — a commercial practice. 

5. By freezing. Example : Cold storage 
of meat.

4 DANGERS OF DUST 

How to keep Food from Spoiling 

The "spoiling" of food is caused by the 
presence of quantities of small living things. 
These grow on many varieties of food and 
cause what we call " decay." 

Some Helps toward keeping Food from 
Spoiling 

1. Have everything — room, walls, floor, 
tables, and dishes — absolutely clean. 

2. Keep hands and clothing clean. 

3. Wherever practicable boil dishes for 
ten minutes after they have been used for 
anything that is not quite fresh. 

4. Keep insects away. 

5. Keep room sunned and aired. 

6. Never buy stale meat, fruits, vege- 
tables, eggs, or milk. 

7. Never put clean food near food that 
is spoiled. 

Why Dirty Stores are Dangerous 

Dirty stores have many corners where 
these small living things can grow and in- 
crease. Dust gives them a good nest, flies 



GOOD AND BAD COOKING 5 

may carry them about, foul odors may be 
absorbed by food. Food that has begun to 
spoil may cause other food to spoil, simply 
by touching it. Dirty stores may make the 
salespeople ill, and these persons may cause 
food to spoil, simply by handling it. 

HOW TO EAT 

Kinds of Food to Eat 

1. Food that gives muscular strength. 

2. Food that gives heat. 

3. Food that keeps the blood in good 
order. 

4. Food that gives working power. 

5. A mixed diet of meat and vegetable 
food is the best in order to get these results. 

6. Vegetables and fruit, while they do 
not contain much nourishment, are neces- 
sary to prevent some diseases. Grown peo- 
ple, and still more children, who never eat 
them, often develop scurvy. 

Necessity for Good Cooking 

Unless food is well digested it will not 
give strength, and it will not be well digested 



6 METHODS OF COOKING 

unless it is well cooked. Bad cooking may- 
destroy the health of the entire family, and 
so lessen the earning power and general 
prosperity. 

Results of Bad Cooking 

Badly cooked meat will be tough, dry, 
and indigestible. 

Badly cooked cereals will be pasty and 
sticky. 

Badly made bread will be heavy. 

Badly made puddings will be heavy and 
sticky. 

Badly cooked vegetables will have a hard, 
woody substance in them. 

HOW TO COOK 

Food is cooked to make it palatable, to 
render it digestible, and to destroy all dan- 
gerous bacteria. 

Methods of Cooking 

1. Boiling : Cooking in boiling water. 

2. Stewing : Cooking in simmering water. 

3. Steaming: Cooking over boiling water. 

4. Broiling: Cooking over direct heat. 



METHODS OF COOKING 7 

5. Roasting — Baking: Cooking in heated 
oven. 

6. Braising: Combined steaming and 
baking. 

7. Frying : Cooking in deep fat. (Should 
not be used for sick persons.) 

8. Saute*ing: Cooking in a very little fat. 
(Very indigestible.) 

9. Fricasseeing: Saut&ng and serving 
with a sauce. Tough meat is boiled be- 
fore fricasseeing. This is not good for sick 
persons. 



PART I 
THE PREPARATION OF FOOD 



THE PREPARATION OF EACH CLASS 
OF FOOD 

DRINKS 

Drinks in Place of Tea and Coffee 

Milk. — A real food. Makes blood and 
strength. 

" Cambric- -^eh^— d5qtlal parts"0i~irot 
milk-arai^ateT'sweeteTied: to taste. 

Cocoa. — A food drink. 

Cereal Coffee. — A drink for variety. 
Will not affect the nerves. 

Cocoa Shells. — The outside of the cocoa 
bean broken in small pieces ; not a food, but 
an excellent drink. 

Rules for making Hot Drinks 

Coffee. — 1 heaping tablespoon of coffee 
for each cup. Measure amount of water 
needed, add half of this cold to coffee, stir- 
ring it thoroughly ; let other half of water 
boil and add to coffee as soon as the cold 
water has come to a boil; boil three minutes, 
11 



12 COLD DRINKS 

let stand ten minutes, pour one tablespoon 
of cold water down spout to settle coffee. 
Always scald coffeepot after using. 

Tea. — Scald teapot, put in it 1 teaspoon 
tea for each cup required, pour required 
number of cupfuls of boiling water on tea, 
let stand three minutes, and serve. Never 
boil the tea. 

Cocoa Shells. — 1 cup shells, 3 pints 
water; boil slowly two hours. Strain and 
serve with milk and sugar. The strength 
of the drink may be changed to suit the 
taste. 

Cocoa (1 cup). — 1 tablespoon cocoa 
mixed with half tablespoon sugar. Stir in 
enough boiling water to make a paste, add 
half cup boiling water, boil 15 minutes, add 
half cup milk and serve. 

Cereal Coffee. — Follow directions on pack- 
age if the coffee is to be strong. Many 
find that half the quantity spoken of on the 
package will make a satisfactory drink. 

Rules for making Cold Drinks 

Lemonade. — 2 tablespoons of syrup, 3 
tablespoons lemon juice, 1 cup cold water. 



MILK 13 

Strain lemon juice and add cold water and 
syrup. 

Orangeade. — May be made the same way. 

Very refreshing summer desserts may be 
made from a frozen mixture of water, fruit 
juice, and sugar. 

LIQUID FOODS 

Milk 
Points to remember about Milk 

Be sure you buy clean milk from a clean 
milkman, and then be careful to keep the 
milk clean. 

Bottled milk is cleaner than loose milk, 
so buy bottled milk if possible. At least 
buy bottled milk for the children, especially 
during hot weather. If there is dirt on 
the inside of the milk bottle when it is 
delivered to you, refuse to accept it. Use 
milk bottles and milk pails for milk and 
for no other purpose than to hold milk. 
If loose milk is bought by the quart, wash 
the pail and scald it before sending the 
pail to the store. Keep the clean pail 
upside down when not in use. When send- 



14 MILK 

ing for milk, put the cover on the pail. 
When the pail contains milk, keep the 
cover on to keep out dust, dirt, flies, and 
animals. 

Buy milk only at clean stores where the 
milk is kept cold by thorough icing. 

Remember that dirty milk causes sick- 
ness and death, especially among babies. 
If you are in doubt as to the cleanliness of 
your milk, boil it and then keep it cold; 
but do not continue to give boiled milk to 
a baby except on a doctor's advice. 

Keep milk bottles and milk covered 
while they contain milk. 

Do not stand milk on the back of the 
stove or on a sunny window sill or in a 
warm place. 

Keep the milk as cold as possible. Keep 
it on ice if possible. 

Wash milk bottles thoroughly before 
returning them to the milkman. 

Never drink milk directly from the bottle 
or from the pail. 

If there has been a contagious disease in 
the house, wash the bottles carefully with 
soap and water and then scald the bottles 



MILK RECIPES 15 

thoroughly before returning to the milk- 
man. 

Keep the milk clean and cold, and insist 
upon getting only cold and clean milk. 

From bulletin issued by the Committee on Milk Con- 
sumers, being a standing committee of the New York 
Milk Committee. 

Often you hear people say, "I cannot 
afford to buy milk," but this is because 
they do not understand that milk is a food, 
and when it is properly used it is not nec- 
essary to spend so much for other food. 

Milk Recipes 
Kumyss. — 

2 tablespoons lukewarm water 

\ yeast cake 

4 cups milk 

1£ tablespoons sugar 

Heat milk until lukewarm, add sugar 
and yeast which have been dissolved in the 
warm water. Fill scalded bottles to within 
two inches of top, cork, and shake. Lay 
bottles on side over night in warm room, 
then put on ice for twenty-four hours. 
Shake the bottles occasionally. 



16 VALUE OF CHEESE 

Junket. — This is a preparation of milk that 
is easily made and is very nourishing and easy 
to digest. t qt< lukewarm milk 

3 tablespoons sugar 
1 tablet 

1 teaspoon cold water 
Any flavoring 

Dissolve tablet in water. Warm milk in 
following manner. Pour into an agate pan, 
and if ice cold, stand pan in boiling water 
five minutes, if merely cooled by ice, three 
minutes. Flavor, sweeten, add dissolved 
tablet, pour into cups, stand in warm room, 
do not shake for a half hour. 

Cheese. — Every housekeeper should learn 
how to use cheese properly, as it has much 
nourishment in small space. Eaten in large 
quantities, it will upset the stomach ; but a 
reasonable quantity, grated or chopped fine, 
can be used in many ways and will add greatly 
to the strength-giving quality of the food. 

Cheese Fondu. — 

1 cup milk 

1 cup bread crumbs 

f cup grated cheese 

legg 

Salt, pepper and mustard 



SOUP MAKING 17 

Soak bread crumbs in milk, heat, add 
cheese, season, and when cheese is melted and 
stirred through crumbs, add beaten egg and 
remove from fire. Spread on crackers or 
toast. 

Hominy baked with Cheese. — Prepare 
boiled hominy in the ordinary way; stir 
grated cheese (J lb. to 2 cups of cooked 
mush) through while hot, make into mound, 
dot with butter, and brown in oven. Any 
cereal can be used instead of hominy. 

Another Method. — Grated cheese can be 
stirred into any thin porridge or gruel, to 
suit taste, and will add much to such a diet. 

SOUPS

Rules for making Stock 

1. Place material in cold water. 

2. Add salt. 

3. Bring slowly to boiling point. 

4. Simmer gently until "strength" is 
drawn out. 

5. Add flavoring during last hour of cook- 
ing. 

6. Cool. 

7. Skim off fat. 

Stock is used as foundation for soup, and 
vegetables, rice, etc., are added to suit the 
case. Often the doctor orders a plain, clear 
stock seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Beef Stock 

2 lb. beef with bone 

1 qt. cold water 

£ teaspoon salt 

Carrot ] 

Potato . , , . „ 

Tomato 1 tablespoon of each 

Celery J 

Wipe meat and bone with cloth wrung out 
of cold water, cut meat in small pieces, cover 
with cold water, soak twenty minutes and 



MEAT BROTHS 19 

bring slowly to boiling heat, then simmer 
slowly for five hours. Add vegetables and 
cook an hour longer, strain, and cool. 
During the cooling, if a clear stock is 
desired, skim off the "scum" that rises to 
the top. 

Beef Juice. — A light food. 

Broil a piece of round very lightly, cut in 
pieces, and press in lemon squeezer until all 
juice is taken out ; add salt. Use as doctor 
directs. 

Beef Tea. — A stimulant. 

Cut thick round steak in bits, place in 
glass fruit jar, sprinkle with salt, screw on 
cover, place jar of meat in saucepan of cold 
water ; bring slowly to boiling point, simmer 
until meat is colorless and broth rich and 
strong. 

Mutton Broth. — 

2 lb. lamb or mutton 
5 cups cold water 
f teaspoon salt 

Make the same as beef stock; add 1^ 
tablespoons well-cooked rice after broth is 
skimmed and reheated. 



20 CREAM SOUPS 

Chicken Broth. — 

3 lb. chicken 
3 pt. cold water 

1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons rice 

After chicken is cleaned, wipe with cloth 
and cut in pieces at joints. Make broth 
same as beef and mutton broth. 

Soups without Stock. — These are made of 
cooked and strained vegetables with milk or 
stock added. Soups of this kind need to be 
thickened slightly or "bound" with a few 
spoons of flour blended smoothly with some 
liquid; otherwise the vegetable part would 
separate and the soup would not be smooth. 

Cream Soups. — These are made with 
"white sauce" or thickened milk and 
strained vegetable pulp. 

Cream of Pea. — 

^ cup canned or green peas 

% cup cold water 

\ teaspoon sugar 

1 cup hot milk 

\ tablespoon butterine 

\ tablespoon flour 

Salt 

Pepper 



MEAT 21 

Drain peas, add sugar and cold water, 
and cook ten minutes. Rub through a 
strainer. Melt butter, rub in flour, pour 
in scalding milk, boil ten minutes, season 
and add to pea pulp. Cook five minutes. 

Other cream soups are made in the same 
way, changing the thickness to suit case. 

MEATS 
How to buy Meat 

Many of the cheaper cuts of meat will 
give a large amount of strength, and may 
be made tender by long, slow cooking. Do 
not send for "fifteen cents' worth of steak," 
but learn the cuts and prices, so that the 
family may receive every ounce of food paid 
for. Learn to read a scale, watch meat 
while it is being weighed, and, if possible, 
have a good scale at home to test correctness 
of the butcher's. 

Always insist on all bones and trimmings 
being sent with the meat and use them in 
soup. 

Ask for a piece of suet, even if it is not 
to be used at the time. Try it out, strain it, 



22 



CUTS OF MEAT 



and put it away in a clean cup. Save all 
trimmings of fat to be tried out in the 
same way, as this dripping is wholesome 
food for well people. When a sick per- 
son cannot digest fat, the trimmings from 
his meat before it is cooked will furnish 
valuable food for the well members of the 
family.

mutton in common use, with average price

Description of Cooking 

Broiling. — Tender steak or chops are best 
broiled. Place in a wire broiler, hold over a 
clear fire until it turns a whitish brown, then 
turn and do the same thing to the other side. 
This sears the meat and keeps in the juice. 
After searing both sides, turn meat back and 
forth, but less often, until both sides are nicely 
browned. Sprinkle with salt, place on hot 
plate, add a bit of butter, and serve at once. 



24 COOKING OF MEAT 

Cooking in Buttered Paper 

A chop can be broiled in a paper case, and 
this will be a way to retain all the juices of 
the meat. 

Method. — Butter a half sheet of foolscap 
or stiff white paper, lay chop in middle, fold 
edges on side and ends, so that there will be 
a half inch fold all around. Begin near 
outer edge, so that fold can be made three 
times. Broil in wire broiler for ten minutes, 
being careful not to set fire to paper. 

Pan Broiling 

If one has no broiler, or cannot have use 
of a good broiling fire, pan broiling is al- 
most as good, and the meat very nearly as 
digestible. 

First, have a hot frying pan just oiled 
with a bit of fat held on a fork. Rub this 
over the pan, but do not leave any loose 
grease. When pan is sizzling hot, put in 
the meat, pressing it down first on one side 
and then on the other. This seals up the 
cut ends of the muscles just as is done by 
holding meat over the fire, and is called 
" searing." When both sides are well seared 



MEAT FOR SICK PERSONS 25 

and no red color remains, turn on pan until 
brown, and treat exactly the same as broiled 
meat. 

To Roast Meat 

Sear roast on hot baking pan, rub with 
salt, cover with another deep pan, cook ac- 
cording to size — allow 15 minutes for each 
pound. After the cooking is well begun, 
the meat must be " basted " every 20 min- 
utes. This is done by taking up juice in 
pan with a large spoon and pouring it over 
meat. If necessary a little hot water may 
be added to pan. During last hour of 
cooking remove cover so that meat will 
brown. 

Gravy. — The only kind of gravy that is 
good for sick people is the clear juice of 
the meat. " Made " gravy, with flour and 
fat added, is hard to digest. 

Meats forbidden Sick Persons 

All fried meats. 

" Warmed over " meat, such as stews and hash. 

Pork. 

Scraped Beef. — This is the form most 
easily digested. 



26 MEAT JELLY 

Use a dull knife or spoon, scrape the soft 
part free from the sinewy and stringy parts; 
serve the soft part raw, between slices of 
bread and butter, or make into small cakes 
and broil. 

Meat Jelly 

1 cup beef stock 

f teaspoon pulverized gelatine 

Stir gelatine into stock while it is at 
boiling heat. Season with salt and celery 
salt, if liked. Pour into small cups which 
have been dipped in cold water. 

FATS 

It is very important that we have plenty 
of fat in our food. Butter is one of the 
most wholesome forms of fat, but it is ex- 
pensive, and it is worth while to learn about 
oleomargarine or " butterine." This is made 
of pure, sweet fats, and has some butter 
mixed with it, in the best quality, so that 
it tastes very good. Butterine costs much 
less than butter, is good food, and is much 
better than poor butter. 



COOKING OF FISH 27 

Salad oil is another good fat to use, and 
the fat of beef is good, but children some- 
times object to eating it. In such cases, 
give some other kind of fat. 

FISH 
How to Buy 

Serve fish once or twice a week instead 
of meat.

Boiled Fish 

Add a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar

28 COOKING OF FISH 

haddock may be boiled whole ; if too large 
for this, cut thick slices, tie in cheesecloth, 
and cook until flesh leaves the bones — 
twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. 

Broiled Fish 

Clean fish, split down the back, lay on 
greased wire broiler, and turn over quickly ; 
heat until thoroughly cooked. 

Baked Fish 

Clean fish, make cut in side, fill with 
nicely seasoned stuffing, and bake in mod- 
erate oven. 

Oysters and Clams 

Raw oysters may be given if doctor allows. 
Clams should be used only in broth. 

Oyster Soup 

1 pt. oysters 2 cups milk 

2 tablespoons butter 

Rinse oysters in cold water. Heat liquor 
to boiling point, strain, add oysters, cook 
until edges curl, add to hot milk, add butter, 
season, and serve. 



COOKING OF EGGS 29 

Clam Broth 

Scrub clams, place in kettle with cold 
water, steam until shells open, strain liquor, 
cool, clean, and reheat to serve. 

EGGS 

How to Buy 

Before buying eggs, test them by shaking. 
Stale eggs will rattle in the shell; fresh 
eggs will remain solid and will not shake. 

The Cooking of Eggs 

Boiled Eggs 

Plunge eggs in boiling water, cover, place 
on back of stove, and allow to remain for 
five or ten minutes, according to degree of 
hardness desired. If the water is allowed 
to boil after eggs are in, the white will be 
tough and indigestible. 

Scrambled Eggs 

Break eggs into a bowl, add one table- 
spoon of milk for each egg, beat with fork, 
pour into greased frying pan, add salt and 



30 USE OF CEREALS 

pepper, and cook until creamy, stirring con- 
stantly. Be very careful not to cook eggs 
until they are hard. 

Creamy Egg 

For each beaten egg use a third of a cup 
of milk, season with salt, and place in inner 
part of double boiler. Cook over steam of 
simmering, not boiling, water until the mix- 
ture is creamy. Remove cover occasionally 
and stir the mixture as it thickens from the 
sides and bottom of the boiler. 

Dropped Egg 

Break an egg into a saucer, slip carefully 
into a saucepan of hot (not boiling) water ; 
cook until white is like jelly. Serve on 
toast. 

CEREALS 

How to Buy 

Buy uncooked cereals rather than the 
cooked cereals in packages, if you wish to 
get your money's worth. Buy at a clean 
store ; and if loose cereal is bought, see that 



VARIETIES OF CEREALS 31 

it has been kept in a dry place. Watch 
cereals for any little live things that may 
get in, especially in warm weather. 

The Cooking op Cereals 
Points to Remember 

1. Have water boiling. 

2. Add salt. 

3. Stir cereal in slowly, cook until thick- 
ening begins. 

4. Place in double boiler and cook sev- 
eral hours, according to kind. It may be 
cooked over night. 

5. Different kinds of cereals need differ- 
ent amounts of water. A general rule is 
two and a half times as much water as 
grain, and a teaspoon of salt for every quart 
of water. 

Different Kinds of Uncooked Cereals 

Fine or ground cereals all need long cook- 
ing, and most of them need several more 
cups of water for each cup of cereal than do 
the flaked varieties.

BREADS 

How to Buy 

Always buy the stale loaves when pos- 
sible, as there is more nourishment for the 
money spent than in the fresh bread. If it 
is impossible to obtain stale loaves, buy 
enough at one time to last two days pro- 
vided there is a clean place to keep it. 
Stale bread is better food than fresh. 

When to make Bread at Home 

If the housekeeper is strong — if there is 
a place to keep bread clean. A large family 



BREAD 35 

can save at least ten cents a day by using 
homemade bread, and it may be well to 
buy a bread mixer, if the housekeeper is not 
strong. The bread mixer will cost about 
$2.50. Flour is cheaper when bought by 
the large bag than by the pound. 

Kinds op Bread 

1. " Unleavened " bread, or bread containing 
nothing to make it " rise." This kind of bread is 
baked in thin sheets or wafers. 

2. Bread raised with baking powder. 

3. Bread raised with yeast. 

The latter kind is the most easily digested 
in all cases. It should never be given fresh. 
Use yeast bread at least twenty-four hours 
old. Toast it if the doctor orders it. 

Toast 

Toast is properly made by a slow drying 
and browning of the bread, rather than by 
a quick browning of the surface, which 
leaves the inside of the slice soft and sticky. 
Well-made toast is more nearly ready for 
digestion than untoasted bread, as the heat 
begins the work of digestion. 



36 BREAD 

Bread 

Homemade bread is really cheaper than 
bakers', even when flour is high-priced, for it 
gives nearly twice as much real food. During 
the summer, when a fire is not kept, bread 
can be baked at almost any bakery for one 
cent a loaf. 

Rule — One Loaf 

1 cup lukewarm water 

\ teaspoon salt 

\ teaspoon sugar 

\ yeast cake 

Flour to make soft dough 

Dissolve yeast in a little lukewarm water, 
stir into one cup of lukewarm water, add 
salt and sugar, then gradually add flour, 
beating and then kneading to a soft dough. 
Let rise until it doubles in size, roll out air 
bubbles, shape into a loaf, cover with melted 
fat, let rise one hour, then bake. 

Oat Wafers 
2 cups rolled oats 
2 cups flour 
4 tablespoons sugar 
\ teaspoon salt 

6 tablespoons shortening, half butterine and half 
lard, hot water 



BREAD 37 

Mix first four materials, rub in shorten- 
ing, add just enough hot water to make 
dough hold together, roll as thin as possible, 
cut out and bake until crisp and brown. 

Graham Bread 

£ cake yeast 

1 cup scalded milk (cooled) 
£ cup lukewarm water 

2 tablespoons lard 
1 teaspoon salt 

£ cup molasses 

2} cups graham flour 

1^ cups white flour 

Dissolve yeast cake in lukewarm water, add 
melted lard to milk, add salt, molasses, and 
yeast, then beat in flour. Cover, set to rise 
over night. In the morning mix well, turn 
into greased pans, let rise until double in size, 
bake one hour. 

Rolls 

White or graham rolls may be made from 
bread dough, and, if desired, a tiny bit of 
butter may be folded into each roll before 
putting in pan. Rolls need not stand in 
pan so long as bread nor do they need so 
long to bake. 



38 VEGETABLES 

Corn Bread 

1 cup water 

1\ cups yellow meal 

2 cups white flour 

2 tablespoons of dripping 

\ teaspoon salt 

5 teaspoons baking powder 

2 tablespoons sugar 

legg 

1 cup milk 

Mix all dry materials, beat into milk and 
water, add beaten egg, pour in shallow 
pans, bake \ of an hour. 



VEGETABLES 

How to Buy 

Any fruit or vegetables which have been 
on stands or carts must be carefully pre- 
pared for use. If boiling is part of this 
preparation, they are comparatively safe. 
Skin of fruit must be washed or removed 
altogether. It is not true economy to buy 
specked or overripe fruit, as its use en- 
dangers health. On the other hand, unripe 
fruit is also unsafe. 



COOKING OF VEGETABLES 39 

How to cook Vegetables 

Nearly all vegetables contain a woody 
substance which must be softened before 
the vegetable is fit for food. They also 
contain starch, which if put to cook in cold 
water becomes like a paste, but if started in 
boiling water is easily digested. Salt should 
be added at the start to improve the flavor.

40 cooking op vegetables 

Use of Vegetables for the Sick 

Let the doctor select the vegetables to be 
given ; then follow directions very carefully. 

A general rule is that the green vege- 
tables, served crisp, may be allowed occa- 
sionally, but more often should be given 
boiled, strained, and warmed either in a 
cream soup (see p 20), or as a vegetable 
with hot milk, slightly thickened. 

Spinach 

Wash very thoroughly, place in kettle 
without water, cover, place on back of stove, 
heat slowly until juice begins to cook out, 
then bring to front of stove and cook in its 
own juice until very tender. Chop fine, sea- 
son, and serve. 

Carrots 

These are very wholesome for well per- 
sons. Wash, scrape, cook in boiling salted 
water, serve mashed or in a cream sauce. 

Cabbage 

This is inexpensive and very wholesome 
served shredded, raw, or boiled with a 
cream sauce. 



FBT7ITS 41 

For cream sauce see p. 20. 

Almost any vegetable can be served in 
this sauce, or if made thinner, we have 
cream of vegetable soup. (See p. 21.) 

FRUITS 

How to Buy 

Unripe fruit and overripe or specked 
fruit are both dangerous. 

Fruits that may be Unripe 
Bananas Plums Pears Peaches 

Bananas are not fit for food unless skins 
are beginning to turn dark. If unripe, they 
are very indigestible; the stringy part should 
be scraped off. 

The Serving and Cooking of Fruit 

Baked Apples 

Wipe apples, remove core, place on flat 
dish, fill the holes with sugar, cover bottom 
of dish with boiling water, baste often, bake 
until very soft. 



42 FRUITS 

Stewed Apples 

Pare and quarter two apples, cook in a 
syrup made of one half cup of sugar boiled 
in half cup of water. Cook until tender, 
but do not allow apples to lose their shape. 

Stewed Apple Sauce 

Quarter and pare apples, sprinkle with 
sugar, cover with water, boil until very 
soft, and rub through a sieve. 

Prune Sauce 

Wash prunes, cover with cold water, and 
stew until soft ; then mash through sieve. 
Do not use sugar. A little lemon juice may 
be added for flavoring. 

Stewed Dried Fruit 

Wash, soak in cold water, drain, and stew 
until soft. Add sugar if necessary, but many 
varieties are good without. Apricots need 
sugar, as they are very tart. 

Oranges 

Serve the juice only, or remove the tough 
white skin and serve only the juicy soft pulp. 



PUDDINGS 43 

Stewed Fresh Berries 

Sprinkle berries with sugar, add enough 
water to moisten, stew until soft. Strain 
if doctor orders. If berries are very juicy, 
no water need be added.

Food for School Children 

The good health of a grown person de- 
pends largely on the food he ate when he 
was a child. Children must eat at regular 
times, and should be given food that will 
make muscle and bone and flesh. 

The breakfast of a school child should 
be : A plate of well-cooked cereal, milk and 
sugar, a soft-cooked egg, bread and butter, 
milk or cocoa or cocoa shells. 

The dinner should be : Some meat cooked 
without grease, a baked potato, a fresh 
vegetable, a simple pudding, bread and 
butter. 

The supper should be: Bread and butter, 
stewed fruit, milk or cocoa. 

School children who are healthy may use 
all the bills of fare in this book.

FEEDING THE SICK 75 

FEEDING THE SICK 
General Rules 

All persons of experience agree that 
proper feeding is absolutely necessary for 
good health, and that many diseases are 
caused directly by badly chosen or improp- 
erly prepared food. On the other hand, 
when illness is present, sensible feeding will 
do much to relieve it. 

The time to begin to take care that a per- 
son is well fed is when he is a child. Some- 
times a mother says, " I can give my baby 
or my child tea, or fried meat, or pie, be- 
cause it does not make him sick." It is 
true that such food may not make the 
child ill at once, but sooner or later the 
bad effects will be seen, either in a dis- 
turbed stomach or in general weakness 
from under nourishment. 

The first thing to do in feeding a sick

greatly. 

Great care should be taken in the prepa- 
ration of food for the sick. Follow all direc- 
tions very carefully. Serve hot food very 
hot. Serve cold food very cold. Have 
everything very clean. Use dishes as at- 
tractive as possible. Arrange the tray so 
that it will be as dainty as possible. Re- 
move soiled dishes at once. Cleanse dishes 
by covering with cold water, then stand pan 
on stove, bring water slowly to boiling point, 
and let boil ten minutes. Never taste food 
that is to be given to a sick person with the 
spoon which he is to use, nor allow him to 
use the spoon of any one else.

Diet in First Stages of Tuberculosis 

The writer has had considerable experi- 
ence in the planning of meals for families 
who have to live on a very moderate sum. 
The expensive food which was once thought 
necessary is sometimes beyond the reach of 
such a family, and it has been proven that 
much can be done by care in preparation 
and regularity in feeding. 

A good foundation plan on which to base 
these diets is a modification of that used by

Principles of Human Nutrition 

A Study in Practical Dietetics 

Cloth, i2tno, 450 pages, index, #7.75 net; by mail, $i.8g 

The present work is a concise presentation of the subject- 
matter related to human nutrition which will be more or less 
adapted to popular use, but particularly to instruction of stu- 
dents with moderate scientific acquirements, whether in col- 
leges, secondary schools, short courses, schools of domestic 
science, or correspondence schools. The reliable knowl- 
edge bearing on the nutrition of man is mainly to be found 
in elaborate works on physiology and physiological chemistry, 
the contents of which are not generally available. More- 
over, the highly technical facts are usually not centered 
around a philosophy of living. The aim here has been to 
show the adjustment of this knowledge to a rational system 
of nutrition without insisting upon adherence to technical 
details that are not feasible in the ordinary administration 
of the family dietary. 

Throughout the author has relied upon the conclusions of 
those authorities and investigators whose sound scholarship 
in this field of knowledge is unquestioned.

District Nursing 

Cloth, i2tno, $1.00 net 
Despite the great benefits which have resulted from district 
nursing, the public knows little, either of the organization or 
of the extent of the movement. It is to inform the great 
mass of readers who are interested in social advance that 
Miss Jacques has written District Nursing. The book is pro- 
vided with a splendid Introduction by Dr. John H. Pryor.

Primary Nursing Technique 

Cloth, i2mo, $1.25 net 
This is a thoroughly honest book for nurses starting on their course 
of study. It is written with the one object in view of inculcating 
in the minds of its readers the fact that an accurate knowledge of 
the human body is the first essential to successful nursing. The 
authoress also urges thoroughness and patience as the sine qua non 
of the nurse. The diction of the book is admirably clear. 

Hygiene for Nurses 

Cloth, i2tno, $1.25 net 
"The pages of this book are full of just the information that every 
woman in charge of souls and bodies needs. The chapters on food, 
ventilation, sewage, causes and disseminatiou of disease, household, 
personal, and school hygiene, the hygiene of occupation, disinfec- 
tion, etc., are all of the most vital general interest and should be 
taken to heart by every one. The task is made easy by the excel- 
lent printing of the little book, . . . which will be found an excel- 
lent book of reference." — Philadelphia Public Ledger. 

The Elements of Hygiene for Schools 

Cloth, i2mo, $.60 net 
The author's chief aim in this book has been to present the prin- 
ciples of hygiene intelligently and impressively, for the sake of 
helping the large number of school children who, after leaving 
school, probably will have no further opportunities to study those 
principles. She has undertaken to show these young people how 
they may have vigor of mind and body through the observance of 
a few simple rules in respect to food, water, air, drainage, clothing, 
occupation, and exercise.
