PREFACE. 



"The Unrivalled Cook -Book" is largely cpmpiled 
from private sources, t The two hundred Creole receipts 

furnished the Editor by her kind friend, Madame Ch n, 

of New Orleans, have been heirlooms in her family for 
more than a century. It is believed that no American 
cook-book has yet contained so complete a list of Creole 
receipts, while other private receipt-books — American 
(North and South), English, Scotch, French, German, Ital- 
ian, and Bussian — have been placed at the Editor's dis- 
posal. The old-fashioned English and Scotch receipts for 
spiced beef, Hunter's beef, Devonshire clotted cream, oat- 
meal and white scones, etc., are scarcely to be found in 
other American cook-books, and this is still more true in 
regard to the Russian soups — exceptionally good of their 
kind — the Italian monastic dishes, and many other re- 
ceipts, notably those for macaroni of all kinds. 

A long residence in foreign countries has convinced 
the Editor that the American cuisine, where it is good, 
is, as is the American market, the best in the world. But 
the very fact that our native cuisine is so good and our 
market so superlative — one must have travelled far and 
wide to know hm/y superlative— makes it important to 
have American cooks furnished with the widest possible 
range of receipts, both American and foreign. Should the 
** Unrivalled Cook-Book " be fortunate enough to gain a 



vi PBEFACE. 

trial, it is believed that it will form an important addi- 
tion to the list of American cook-books, inasmuch as it 
contains all that they contain, and many other receipts 
quite new to the general American public. All the re- 
ceipts are practical ones ; that is, they have all, or nearly 
all, been tried in the houses of frieods, or in that of the 
Editor, and with complete success. In the arrangement 
of the receipts the system adopted has been that of 
*' Oommon-sense in the Household." But nothing else 
has been borrowed from,th9.t, or any other book, except 
one or two receipts, which have been, in every instance, 
•noted. an(i ac|:no>vledged: :Npt that all the receipts i^ 
this bpok are now published for the first time ; but only 
that ^herQ an entirely newpne has been given, its scnrce 
has been indicated. It i§ liQped that the^ pUbKo may^ find 
the; " Unrivalled Oobfe-Bopk" a help to all housekeep- 
ers, and :a thing : .; 

" Made up of every creatoress best.'* 

. Tlie Editor's name is unknown to fame, and would add 
nothing to the success of the book. In calling it "Mrs. 
Waslu'ngton's Unrivalled Cook-Book'' she borrows a name 
dear to every son and daughter of the mighty Republic; 
nor can 'she feel that she lias taken ad undue liberty in 
calling herself Mrs. "Washington. Was not Washington 
the father of his country? and have not all children a 
riglit to their father's naine?

THE UNRIYALIED COOK-BOOK. 



HORS D'CEUVRES. 

Hobs d'ceuvres, or zaksiiska, or antlpasta, as they are 
variously called in France, Russia, and Italy, are of two 
kinds, cold and hot, but more often cold. They should be 
prettily arranged in the small dishes sold for the purpose, 
and placed on the dinner or luncheon table before the be- 
ginning of the meal. Olives, mixed pickles, celery, etc., 
are all hors d'oeuvres, and require no further attention 
than to be arranged prettily and symmetrically in their 
dishes. The hors d'oeuvres given below, however, require 
a certain amount of preparation. 

Artichokes. — Choose small, tender artichokes, pull oflE 
the leaves, and remove the heart from the bottom of the 
plant. Throw the hearts into vinegar and water for half 
an hour or longer, then wipe dry with a clean cloth, ar- 
range in a hors d'oeuvre dish, salt them lightly, pepper 
them with white pepper, stick little bits of ice among 
them, and serve. 

Boast Almonds (No. 1). — Blanch half a pound of al- 
monds, roll them in fine table salt, and roast them in a 
pan as you would coffee. 

Hoast Almonds (No. 2). — Blanch half a pound of al- 
monds as above, immerse in fresh cream for half an hour, 
then dry, roll in salt, and roast. 

1 



2 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Blanched Peanuts. — Blanch, roll in salt, roast as you 
do almonds. 

Radishes. — Wash carefully, and scrape the skin off the 
long radishes. Half peel the round ones, giving the effect 
of an opening rosebud. Arrange in a hors d'oeuvre dish. 

Salted Cucumbers {Guisini^re Polonaise). — Wash and 
wipe carefully some medium-sized green cucumbers, then 
put them to dry -for twenty-four hours in a warm, dry 
place. Have ready a small cask in which white wine has 
been kept. Warm this cask thoroughly, put in the bot- 
tom a layer of the cucumbers, chopped fennel and cherry 
leaves, with a little bruised coriander-seed. Proceed in 
this way until the cask is three fourths full. Then pour 
on salted water which has boiled and cooled, close the 
cask with the greatest care, and put it in a cool place on 
two pieces of wood. As the water is absorbed, fill up 
with cold boiled water. Turn every day, and scrape off 
the mould if any forms on the exterior. At the close of 
two or three months the upper cover may be taken off 
the barrel, and planks and a weight put on the cucum- 
bers to keep them down. 

Bologna Sausage. — Cut the Bologna sausage very thin, 
and arrange in a small dish. Garnish with crimped pars- 
ley. 

Caviare. — Use none but the finest Kussian caviare. Put 
in a small hors d'oeuvre dish. Garnish with slices of lemon. 

Caviare Sandwiches. — Cut some white bread very thin. 
Spread thickly with caviare. Cut into lozenge - shaped 
sandwiches. Garnish with crimped parsley, and dish. 

Shrimps. — Boil to a bright red, arrange in a small dish, 
surround with crimped parsley, and serve. 



HOBS DCEUVRES. 3 

Variegated Sandwiches. — Cut an eqnal qnantity of 
pumper-nickel bread and fine white bread very thin; 
spread with butter, then with the roe of salted herring ; 
lay a slice of pumper-nickel on a slice of white bread, 
press firmly together, trim into lozenge -shaped sand- 
wiches, and serve. 

Butter. — The butter for hors d'oeuvre should always be 
formed into tiny pats, or rolled into balls, garnished with 
crimped parsley, and served with little bits of ice. 

Olives. — If the olives should be too salt, soak them in 
fresh water for half an hour before serving. They should 
be completely covered with water, or they will thicken. 

Anchovies. — Always buy, if possible, the Nice ancho- 
vies, they are small, round, and plump. In preparing an- 
chovies for hors d'oeuvre they should be soaked for two 
hours in cold water. Then divide, skin, and bone them, 
arrange in a hors d'oeuvre dish, which must previously 
have been well rubbed with garlic ; dust with roasted pars- 
ley, cover with olive-oil, and serve. 

Truffles au Yin. — Cook green truffles whole in a sauce- 
pan with some fat meat chopped fine, a bay leaf, parsley, 
thyme, a little bouillon, and half a bottle of white wine ; 
salt and pepper. Eemove your truffles from the sauce, 
drain well, and serve on a folded napkin. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — Choose large, fine ones. Peel 
and remove the stems ; place them bottom upwards on the 
gridiron ; fill them with butter in which you have kneaded 
chopped parsley ; salt and pepper a moment before you 
serve them. 

Boiled Peanuts. — Choose fresh well -filled peanuts. 
Carefully selecting them, as nearly as possible, the same

size. Boil them in salt water, drain and serve. This is 
generally served before the soup. 

Cucurnbers. — Grate your cucumbers, season with salt 
and pepper. Garnish your hors d'oeuvre dish with crimped 
parsley. 

Stuffed Olwes. — Eemove the stems from the olives, and 
stuff them with anchovies, pounded with enough olive-oil 
to moisten them thoroughly. 

Sardines, — Arrange them carefully in a dish, and gar- 
nish with crimped parsley. 

Sapsago Sandwiches, — Grate some sapsago cheese ; mix 
it to a paste with fresh butter. Cut your slices of bread 
very thin, and all the same size and form; butter them, 
and arrange them tastefully in the hors d'oeuvre dish. 

Hazelnut Butter. — Pound some ripe hazelnuts with 
fresh butter. Mould it into little forms, and serve. 

PicJded Oysters, — Drain the oysters. Arrange them 
in the hors d'oeuvre dish, on a bed of crimped parsley. 



SOUPS. 



GENERAL DIBECTIONB. 



Chief among soups is beef sonp, or beef bouillon. 
That is, it is the safest foundation for soups and sauces. 
Oouff^ asserts that without beef it is impossible to have 
what he calls a pot axi^feu extra. The best soup or stock 
pot is of copper, or iron, enamelled inside with tin, or, 
better still, with porcelain. The best parts of beef to buy 
for the soup pot are the coUops, the rump, the brisket, 
and the shin. The shoulder and heel may also be used, 
but do not make such strong soup. Beef, for soup, should 
be extremely fresh^ and the same thing is true of all soup 
meat. (Gouffd) 

The fire should be clear, even, and steady. It should 
not be fierce, and you should carefully avoid allowing it 
to become so, when you replenish it. All soups should 
be cooked steadily and slowly. Be careful never to cover 
the pot quite closely. The cover should be raised on one 
side for about an inch or more. 

The meat should be prepared as follows : First, cut the 
meat from the bones ; secondly, bind it with a cord or cut 
it into strips ; thirdly, crack the bones thoroughly with a 
mallet. 

Put the bones into the pot first, then the meat ; then 
pour on the water, which should be filtered ; allow a 
quart of water to each pound of beef ; heat very slowly, 
and do not add the salt until the meat is pretty well 
cooked ; boil the meat to rags, and be careful to skim 
the soup from time to time. When vegetables are cooked 
in the soup, to give it a flavor, they must be carefully re- 



6 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

mored with a perforated skimmer as soon as they are 
tender. When the soup is strong enough, which will 
probably be in six or seven hours' time, remove the meat, 
strain the soup through a fine strainer, taste, salt again, if 
necessary, and set it away to cool. Use it the next day, 
first skimming oS the fat. Then heat, strain %ain, color 
with caramel, and serve. 



To Make Good Stock. — Boil some bones (of beef, mut- 
ton, veal, poultry, or game, or all together) for four hours ; 
then pour off the liquor into the stock-pot, and add to 
each gallon the meat off a knuckle of veal, a pound of 
lean beef, a pound of absolutely lean bacon, all sliced fine, 
with two or three scraped carrots, two onions, two tur- 
nips, two heads of celery sliced, and two quarts of water. 
Stew until the meat is boiled to rags, being careful not to 
let it burn. 

To Clarify Stock. — Put the stock over a good fire, and, 
when boiling, add the white of one egg to each quart of 
stock, proceeding as follows : beat the whites of the eggs 
up well in a little water ; then add a little hot stock ; beat 
to a froth, and pour gradually into the pot ; then beat 
the whole hard and long ; allow it to boil up once, and 
immediately remove and strain through a thin fiannel 
cloth. 

Asparagus Oreen Soup. — Three pounds of veal, cut 
into small pieces; one half pound of salt pork; three 
bunches of asparagus ; one gallon of water. 

Cut the entire stalk of the asparagus into pieces an 
inch long; and when the meat has boiled one hour, add 
half of the asparagus to the liquor in the pot ; boil half 
an hour longer and strain, pressing the asparagus pulp 
very hard to extract the green coloring ; add the other 
half of the asparagus (the heads only, which should be 
kept in cold water until you are ready for them), and boil 



SOUPS. 7 

twenty ttiinutes more ; then serve with small bread dice 
fried in butter. 

Com Soup. — One large chicken cut into small pieces ; 
twelve ears of green corn, young and tender ; one gallon 
of water ; salt to taste. 

Boil the chicken to rags ; then cut the ^orn from the 
cob, and put into the pot, and stew an hour longer, still 
gently ; remove the chicken, season with salt and pepper ; 
thicken with corn flour, and serve at once. 

Pur^ of Carrots with Cream. — To the liquor in which 
a knuckle of veal has been boiled add twelve large car- 
rots ; boil till the carrots will mash through a sieve ; put 
them through, and then let them boil in the broth until 
it is quite smooth ; add half a pint of cream and a little 
salt. 

White Soup of Jerusalem Artichokes. — The stock of 
veal, to which add three pounds of boiled artichokes, to 
be pulped through a sieve ; season with salt, a soupgon 
of cayenne pepper, and before it is poured into the tureen 
stir in some good, thick cream. It must on no account be 
allowed to boil after the cream is poured in, but care 
should be taken that it is not chilled by it. 

Almond Soup. — Blanch one and a half pounds of sweet 
almonds, and one dozen bitter almonds. Throw them in 
cold water, drain well, and pound them in a mortar, tak- 
ing care not to let them oil, by adding from time to time 
a little water ; put a quart and a half of water in a sauce- 
pan ; when it boils put in half the grated rind of a lemon 
and a few coriander seeds, and let them steep a few min- 
utes ; then stir in your pounded almonds ; strain through 
a fine sieve, put in a pinch of salt, and sweeten to taste. 
Warm this in a iain-marie; sprinkle some fried crou- 
tons (they should be a light gold color), with powdered 



8 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

sugar, and, just before serving, throw them in your lait 
(Tamandes. 

This is a Spanish soup de rigueur for Christmas. They 
add powdered cinnamon. 

Barsch de Gallicie^ Busaicm Beet Soup. — The day be- 
fore making the barsch prepare the beet juice in the fol- 
lowing manner: peel and cut in slices three large red 
beets ; put tliem into an earthen jar, and cover them with 
tepid water, to which you have added a little vinegar; 
add also about six ounces of bread crumbs, and two glasses 
of milk. Cover the jar closely, and keep it in a warm 
place for twenty-four hours ; then strain and filter. The 
juice will be of a beautiful clear red color. 

To make the barsch : four quarts of sour beet juice 
prepared as directed above ; four pounds of beef haunch ; 
one pig's ear, salted, scalded, and blanched; two ehnlots. 
Take one bunch of celery, chopped fine; one beet, 
chopped fine; one shalot; some mushrooms; have the 
shalot, celery, beet, and mushrooms all fried to a light 
brown in butter. 

Put the beef into an earthen pot, and cover with the 
four quarts of sour beet juice. Put on the fire and skim 
carefully all the scum which rises to the top; as soon 
as it boils set the pot back, where the soup will not boil, 
but simmer ; add the pig's ear, the two whole shalots. and 
cook slowly until the vegetables are tender; then strain 
and pour three quarts of the bouillon thus made over the 
fried vegetables ; let it come to a boil, and add four smoked 
sausages ; twenty miautes afterward add several spoon- 
fuls of raw beet juice filtered (this juice should be of the 
brightest red color) ; add also the pig's ear, cut into jdice, 
and a piece of the beef cut into dice ; cut the sausages 
into thick slices, and arrange them in the soup tureen ; 
add a pinch of powdered parsley to the soup, pour, it into 
the soup tureen, and serve with little crusts of bread cut 
into squares, hollowed, and fried in butter; the hollow in 



SOUPS. 9 

the centre of each square shonld be filled with cooked 
beef marrow. This is the king of soups. 

Bean Sowp (dried). — Kidney, mock-turtle, or rice, or 
field bean. The mock-turtle is best. One gallon of cold 
water; one quart of beans, soaked over-night in luke- 
warm water ; two pounds of salt pork, cut into small 
pieces ; one teaspoonf ul of brown sugar ; one red-pepper 
pod. 

Put the water, pork, and beans into the soup pot, and 
boil three hours, closely covered ; then shred into the pot 
a head of celery, and the red-pepper pod. Simmer now 
an hour longer, stir in the sugar, strain, and serve with 
slices of lemon. 

Or, you may substitute equal parts of beef and lean 
ham for the pork, and at the last moment drop small 
forcemeat balls and slices of hard-boiled eggs into the 
soup tureen. This more luxurious treatment, however, 
only befits the mock-turtle bean. 

Poor MarCa Bean^ or Lentil Soup. — One half pound of 
brown lentils, or dried beans; one carrot; four cloves; 
three onions ; a small bunch of sweet herbs ; one and a 
half ounces of dripping ; pepper and salt to taste. 

Wash the lentils well in several waters ; let them then 
soak in two quarts of water for twenty-four hours. When 
ready to make the soup, cut up the onion and carrot in 
thin slices, and fry to a light brown in the dripping. Put 
them into a pot with what remains of the dripping, and 
add the lentils and the water in which they were steeped, 
also the herbs and cloves ; boil all for three hours, add- 
ing more water to make up the waste from boiling ; add 
pepper and salt to taste ; strain through a coarse sieve, and 
serve in a soup tureen with small dice of fried bread. 

Cdl/oei 'Head Soup. — Parboil in salt and water half 
a calf's head, nicely cleaned and prepared; cut it in 

1* 



10 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

little dice and set it apart. Fat some butter in a sauce- 
pan, stir in enough browned flour to make a roux; add 
an onion stuck with cloves, a bay leaf, thyme, parsley, 
sweet-basil, and sweet-marjoram, some stalks of celery ; 
one pound of lean ham ; one and a half pounds of lean 
beef ; a pinch of cayenne pepper ; add enough bouillon 
to make your soup rich and thick ; let it cook two hours ; 
strain it through a colander ; return it to the saucepan ; 
add your calf's head cut in dice ; some yolks of hard- 
boiled eggs cut in quarters; and, just before serving, add 
a glass of good Madeira and a dessertspoonful of lemon 
juice. 

Cherry Soup, — Take some ripe cherries and stem them, 
crush them in a mortar, cracking the kernels, and pour 
them in a porcelain -lined saucepan, with as much wine 
and water as you have cherries ; add some grated lemon 
rind ; let it boil till the fruit is cooked to a pulp ; strain 
it through a hair sieve ; sweeten to taste ; add some cin- 
namon ; warm it, and serve it poured over fried croutons 
of bread. 

Beer Soup. — Scorch half a pound of bread crumbs in 
some fresh butter ; add a quart of strong beer, as much 
red wine, the rind of a lemon, cinnamon, cloves, and 
sugar; let it boil up once, and pour your soup over crou- 
tons of fried bread in your tureen. 

BouiUoriy Cold (for summer). — Make a strong beef 
bouillon according to the receipt given for clear soup d la 
Virffinie; when sufficiently strong (and for this purpose 
it should be very strong), skim, strain, salt, and set it away 
to cool. When quite cold, strain again, and when per- 
fectly clear, heat again, and add enough caramel coloring 
to give it the right color; then remove from the fire, 
strain, and set away to cool ; serve ice cold, with Pied- 
montese (Italian) bread, browned. 



SOUPS. 11 

BouiUon Blanc (White Soup).— Put into the soup pot 
two knuckles of veal, several veal bones, and a chicken ; 
pour over them four quarts of water, and salt slightly; 
when the soup comes to a boil skim carefully, and draw 
to the side of the stove where it will simmer but not boil ; 
keep the pot three fourths covered ; -let it cook very slow- 
ly, arranging the position of the pot so that, if possible, it 
will only boil on one side ; half an hour later add a large 
carrot, a small piece of white turnip, a piece of celery, two 
shallots, and a tiny bunch of parsley ; cook slowly until all 
the meat has fallen from the bones, and is completely 
boiled to rags ; then strain the bouillon, first through a 
fine sieve, and then through a cloth, and set it away to 
cool. This stock may be used for all white soups. 

BouiUon Succulent. — ^Put into the soup pot four and a 
half pounds of lean beef cut into small squares ; pour over 
eight quarts of cold water ; put the pot on the fire, and 
cook slowly as above directed ; two hours afterwards add 
the bone of a piece of roast beef, or of roast leg of mut- 
ton ; continue to cook slowly until the meat is boiled ab- 
solutely to rags, or, better still, to shreds ; then add a tea- 
spoonful of burned sugar, and salt to taste ; strain and 
skim. This receipt makes a very good, clear bouillon. 

Juliefme Soup. — Clean and peel two large carrots and a 
turnip ; add a head of celery, two nqw onions, a shallot, 
half a Savoy cabbage, a fine head of lettuce, a handful 
of sorrel, and some tender green pease ; cut the vegeta- 
bles into fine shreds about two inches long. 

Put the onions and shallot into' a casserole with some 
butter; cook for a few minutes over a moderate fire; 
then add the carrots, turnip, and celery ; cook for a few 
moments ; add a little salt and a pinch of sugar, and pour 
over them the third of a quart of strained and clear bouil- 
lon ; cook the vegetables in this until the bouillon begins 
to jelly ; .then add two quarts of strong, fresh bouillon, 



12 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

boiling hot ; draw the soup pot to the side of the fire, 
and twenty-five rainutes later add the lettuce, the blanched 
cabbage, and last of all the raw green pease; cook the 
vegetables for three quarters of an hour ; then skim the 
soup ; add the chopped sorrel (well blanched) and a glass 
of puree of fresh green pease ; mix all well together, and 
pour into the soup tureen. 

Julienne d la Jiusse. — Cut into fine shreds a carrot, a 
small turnip, n piece of celery, a large radish, two onions, 
and a shallot ; slired also some mushrooms (as many as the 
other vegetables). 

Fry the onions, shallot, and other vegetables very lightly 
in butter ; lay them on paper until the grease is absorbed, 
and then put them in a casserole ; pour over them the 
third of a quart of good bouillon, and boil until the bouil- 
lon jellies ; then pour on three quarts of fresh bouillon, 
boiling hot; draw the casserole to the side of the fire, 
and allow it to simmer for an hour and a half; then 
strain -and skim the soup; add a pinch of chopped fennel, 
and a few spoonfuls of sour cream (strained); pour into 
the soup tureen, and serve. In Eussia a plate of tiny

duced to the consistency of paste ; then add some bread 
crumbs soaked in cream, and twelve blanched sweet al* 
monds; again chop and pound until the whole has been 
reduced to the consistency of a smooth, thick paste ; place 
this paste in an earthen bowl, which should previously 
have been well rubbed with garlic, and add little by little, 
stirring all the time, some good chicken broth ; take care 
to have the puree neither too thin nor too thick ; it 
should be as thick as custard ; when it is of the proper 
consistency strain it through a tin strainer ; pour it into 
an earthen stewpan ; salt to taste, and cook d bain-marie. 

Cucumber Soup, Cold. — Put into a stewpan tlnee pounds 
of fish, half a pound of absolutely lean ham, two large

chopped fine; boil until the fish and ham are in rags, 
then strain and set aside to cool ; when quite cold skim 
and strain again, and, if the soup is entirely clear and 
freed from fat, pour into the soup tureen, which should 
previously have been well rubbed with garlic; have ready 
some sliced cucumber prepared as for the garspacho ; i. e., 
peeled, sliced very thinly, soaked in ice -water for two 
houi*s, and dressed with vinegar, pepper, and salt ; add 
these to the soup, and also some dice of dried bread dipped 
in lemon juice. If properly made, this is a delicious soup.

the water, boiling hot ; when the soup has boiled in all for 
two hours and a half strain it, and set it aside to cool ; 
when quite cold and clear add some roasted parsley pow- 
dered tine, and the ham, which should previously have 
been dried in the oven and grated fine ; salt and pepper

mixed spice ; when the onions are slightly colored, add the 
fish, salt to taste, and add an infinitesimally small piece of 
powdered saffron, a glass of white wine, and suflScient boil- 
ing water to come up to, but not cover the fish ; or, add 
water in which clams have previously been boiled; this 
gives the houilldbaisse an exquisite flavor; let the bouiUa- 
hdisse now boil fast for twenty minutes, or until the liquor

SOUPS. 26 

CourtbouiUon d la Oriole. — Slice and fry some onions in 
a saucepan, with sliced tomatoes, salt, and pepper ; clean 
and scale your fish ; cut it in slices ; put it in the saucepan 
with the onions and tomatoes and some water, add a little 
chopped parsley ; cook till the fish is done ; then add a 
glass of claret, or white wine ; let it boil up ; remove the 
fish, which you dress in a dish, on slices of toasted bread ;

CotiribouiUon for Sea Fish — Boil in equal parts of 
milk and water; season well with salt and pepper; the 
fish becomes white and firm. Serve with Harvey or 
Worcestershire sauce. 

Clam Soup. — Fifty clams ; one quart of milk ; one pint 
of water ; two tablespoonf uls of butter. Put the clams into 
a large pan or tray, and pour cold water over them ; as fast 
as they unclose, take them out, saving all the liquor ; put 
all the liquor of the fifty clams on the fire with a dozen 
whole peppers, a few bits of cayenne pods, half a dozen 
blades of mace, and salt to taste ; let it boil for ten min- 
utes, keeping it closely covered ; then put in the clams, 
and let it boil for another half-hour, still covered ; at this 
point add the milk, which should previously have been 
heated to scalding in another vessel ; boil up again, taking 
care that the soup does not burn, and put in the butter; 
then serve without delay. If you desire a thicker soup, 
stir into the quart of hot milk a heaping teaspoonful of 
rice fiour, wet up with cold milk. 

Catfish Soup. — Six catfish, each weighing one half 
pound ; half pound of salt pork, one pint of milk ; two 
eggs ; one head of celery ; one onion. Skin and clean the 
catfish and cut off the heads ; then bone and cut up the

ions, pepper, and salt, and four quarts of water ; stew stead- 
ily for five hours, never ceasing the boiling during all tlie 
time ; then strain, thicken with browned flour, and put in 
the green fat, cut in pieces an inch long. The green fat 
should previously have been simmered for one hour in two 
quarts of water. Thicken with browned flour, return to 
the soup pot, and simmer gently an hour longer. If there 
are eggs in the turtle, boil them in a separate vessel for 
four hours, and throw into the soup before taking it up ; 
if not, put in the forcemeat balls, then the juice of the 
lemon, and the wine; beat up once, and pour out. Some 
cooks add the forcemeat before straining, boiling all to- 
gether five hours; then strain, thicken, and put in the 
green fat, cut into strips an inch long. This is the cus- 
tom followed at the lord-mayor's dinner in London. 

For the mock eggs, take the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs, and one raw egg well beaten ; rub the boiled eggs 
into a paste with a teaspoonf ul of butter, bind with a raw 
egg, roll into pellets shaped like turtles' eggs, and poach in 
beef broth (boiling) for two minutes before dropping into 
the soup. 

Forcemeat BaUsfor the above. — Six tablespoonfuls of

liquid to a strong consomme of clear stock, made thus: 
For one pound of dried turtle : five pounds of gravy beef, 
two pounds of leg veal, one calf's foot, and a half pound of 
lean ham. Cover with water and bring to a boil, remov- 
ing the scum ; add three carrots, two onions, one head of 
celery, and a packet of turtle herbs and spices ; let all sim- 
mer gently for eight hours; strain through a fine cloth 
into* a saucepan, and add the turtle meat and liquor; let 
all boil together until the turtle meat is quite tender ; add 
a half-pint of good sherry, and the soup is ready for use. 
This win make four quarts of good soup. 

Terrapin Soup, — Clean and cut up a large terrapin with 
the entrails and bones; remove the gall carefully; put 
your terrapin in a soup pot with four quarts of water, a 
soup bunch, a head of celery, onions, thyme, pareley, salt, 
and pepper; let it simmQr four hours; do not let it cease 
one moment to cook; strain your soup, thicken it with 
browned flour, return it to the soup pot; tie up in a muslin 
bag half a tablespoonful of cloves, allspice, and a cracked 
nutmeg ; let it simmer an hour in the soup, then remove. 
If the turtle has eggs, boil them and throw in the yolks ; 
if there are no eggs, use forcemeat balls; add a glass of 
Madeira and thin slices of lemon before serving. The 
forcemeat balls are made by rubbing two hard-boiled 
yolks to a paste, with butter, and half a dozen spoonfuls 
of the turtle meat, chopped very fine, and seasoned with

salt and pepper ; bind with beaten eggs ; make into balls ; 
dip, first, into beaten egg^ then into powdered cracker, and 
fry in butter. 

Oyster Soup. — Two quarts of oysters with their liquor; 
one quart of milk; two tablespoonfuls of butter; one tea- 
spoonful of water. 

Pat the strained oyster liquor and the water into a sauce- 
pan, which is set in a larger one nearly full of boiling wa- 
ter ; heat slowly, and, when the liquor begins to boil, sea- 
son with pepper and salt, and stir in the milk ; then stir 
constantly until the soup nears the boiling-point again ; 
then throw in the oj'sters, and let them stew until they 
plump and rixSLe at the edge ; then put in the butter and 
stir well until it is melted; serve immediately. 

Ouka (Russian national soup). — Of all the admirable 
soups prepared in Russia, the ouka is the best. It is pre- 
pared with small sterlets, cooked the instant they are killed. 
As the sterlet, however, exists only in Russia, it is only 
possible to reproduce an imitation of the ouJca in other 
countries. The best imitation is that made with fresh 
brook trout ; but they must be brought into the kitchen 
alivej and cooked the moment they are killed. Prepare 
first two full quarts of fish stock (using for the ouka fresh- 
water fish. Meanwhile, cnt into fine shreds, as for Juli- 
enne, some celery and parsley; blanch, drain, and fry 
lightly in butter; then cook them in a little bouillon. 
Prepare, also, two dozen tiny forcemeat balls of whit- 
ings and lobster-butter mixed ; clarify the bouillon, add a 
glass of good white wine, and two teaspoonf uls of Madeira. 
When the work of preparation has advanced to this point, 
kill three fat, lively, middling-sized brook tront. They 
must be of a good red color. Bone, remove the heads and 
tails, cut into small pieces, clean, skin, and sponge them. 
When the fish consomme is clarified and strained, put a 
small portion of it into a casserole, add two glasses of 



SOUPS. 29 

Bweet champagne ; when it comes to a boil drop in the 
pieces of trout; when they begin to boil take the cas- 
serole from the fire and cover it ; then strain and skim the 
liqnor in which they have been cooked, trim the pieces of 
trout neatly, and arrange them in a very hot dish, pouring 
over them the sauce in which they were cooked ; drop into 
the boiling bouillon the vegetables, add the little force- 
meat balls (which should previously have been cooked d 
havn^7narie\ and pour at once into the soup tureen ; send 
the trout separately. It should be put into the soup by 
the guests themselves. In Kussia the servant who hands 
the soup is followed instantly by another handing the trout. 
Soup so made and served is oukay and is surpassed by no 
other soup man has invented. 

Ga/rapaoho {Spanish Soup Salad). — Two and a half 
quarts fresh tomatoes peeled and sliced thinly ; one large 
cucumber peeled and sliced thinly ; a half clove of garlic ; 
one gallon of water. 

Stew slowly for an hour; then add salt and pepper, 
and a teaspoonful of white sugar; stir until the sugav 
is thoroughly dissolved ; then take the stewpan from 
the lire, strain the soup into a tureen, and set it aside to 
cool. Meanwhile, have ready some fresh cucumbers, peel, 
and slice them as thinly as possible, and lay them in ice- 
water for an hour and a half. When the soup is quite 
cold — ^frost cold — dress the cucumbers with pepper, salt, 
and vinegar, and add them to the soup, stirring carefully 
with a wooden spoon. Lastly, have ready some very 
light white bread, cut into dice and dried (not toast- 
ed) in the oven. When the garspacJio is ready to be 
served, pour a very little tarragon vinegar over the bread, 
and toss the bread quickly into the garspacho. {Eaacelr

put your chicken back in the soup, and just as you remove 
it from the fire, stir ^in a coffeespoonf ul of file powder ; 
serve with boiled rice and little green bird's-eye peppers. 

Shrimp Ochra Gumho, — Slice your ochra and fry it in 
butter or lard, with onions, salt, and pepper; boil your 
shrimps, remove the heads, and peel the tails, and fry them 
in a saucepan with chopped ham, onions, and cayenne pep- 
per; pour your fried ochra and shrimps into a soup pot; 
slice in a quart of fine ripe tomatoes (or in winter take 
a can of tomatoes) ; cook slowly two hours, and serve 
with boiled rice. Always serve fresh green peppers with 
gumbo. 

Crab Ochra Gumbo is made in the same manner, substi- 
tuting crabs for shrimps. 

Gumbo FiU with Oysters, — Boil a large, fine, fat chicken 
in two quarts of water, add a slice of ham, and season to 



SOUPS. 31 

taste. Take the liquor of fifty oysters and pour it in the 
bouillon. When the chicken is cooked, take it out of the 
soup ; strain your soup through a colander, and just before 
serving throw in the oysters, and let them cook five min- 
utes, till they 2ire plump; remove your soup pot from the 
fire, and stir in an after-dinner-coffeespoonf ul of the JUe

a cabbage soup. The next day cut up, as for a Julienne^ 
two heads of celery, an onion, two leaves of cabbage, two 
or three leeks (this is enough for six persons) ; fry with 
either butter or lard in a saucepan. When the vegetables 
are half cooked, pour in the bouillon set aside the preced-

Pot au Feu. — Beef makes the most wholesome and best 
soup. Put your meat in cold water with a little salt ; the 
fire should be so slow that the soup cannot boil before the 
skim rises and is carefully removed ; add carrots, turnips, 
leeks, celery, pai*sley roots, a bay leaf, one or two cloves, a 
clove of garlic, and a fried onion to give color ; let it boil 
slowly until the meat is done. To make good soup the 
most important thing is to keep it simmering without 
ceasing one moment. It requires from five to six hours 
to make a good pot au feu. The proper proportions are

three pounds of meat for four quarts of water. When 
the soup is done, pour it boiling hot through the colander, 
over slices of bread in the tureen. Never boil bread in 
soup, as that spoils the flavor. The remains of game or 
poultry added to the beef is a good addition. A piece of 
the breast of mutton improves the taste, and can be served 
the following day broiled. 

Cuddo^ Pot an Feu di la Portv^aise, — Put into an earth- 
en pot two pounds of beef, a piece of raw ham, a mutton 
bone, a chicken, two handf uls of beans parboiled ; add five

simmer, but not boil ; two hours later add a small cabbage 
(blanched), a soup^qn of garlic, two large tomatoes peeled 
and sliced, a carrot peeled and sliced, and two or three 
cloves ; an hour later add two smoked sausages. When

casserole and keep it hot. Meanwhile, put into another 
pot an onion, chopped fine and fried in butter to a light 
brown ; add to this a handful of rice, and fill the pot three 
quarters full of bouillon ; cover, and cook slowly. When 
the rice is cooked add two tablespoonf uls of tomato sauce, 
and a teaspoonf ul of white pepper ; put into a soup tureen, 
and pour over the rice the bouillon, which must previous- 
ly have been carefully strained ; arrange the soup meat, 
beef, ham, chicken, and sausage on a long oval dish ; sur- 
round with the vegetables, and serve, 

Puchero^ Pot au Feu d la Espagnole. — Put into an

and lights ; as soon as the chickens are cooked take them 
out of the pot, strain the bouillon, and pour two quarts of 
it into another casserole ; allow this to come to a boil ; and 
when at boiling-point add enough corn flour to thicken it 
to a cream ; twenty-five minutes later skim the soup ; pour 
into the heated soup tureen ; add the chickens and ham 
chopped fine, and a pinch of cliopped fennel.

pound of liver, two carrots, four turnips, eight young or 
two old leeks, one very large head of celery, two onions 
(one of them burned) with a clove in each, a piece of pars- 
nip, and some sliced okra ; skim again and simmer five

head in slices and then into small squares, which must be 
put into the soup when it is warmed up for use ; finish it 
np with a forcemeat and little egg balls, a teacupful of 
white wine, a little sliced lemon, and very little sugar.

or three handfuls of pearl barley, and continue to cook 
slowly, but steadily, until the meat is boiled to i*ags; then 
take out the meat and skim and strain the soup until it is 
thoroughly freed from grease ; set the casserole containing 
the soup in a warm place on the stove, where the soup 
will keep hot but not boil ; take the breasts of the chicken, 
chop, and pound them to a paste in a mortar ; adding the 
yolks of eight eggs and one whole egg; also a glass of the 
thickest fresh cream ; season with salt, nutmeg, and a pinch 
of sugar ; then pass through a fine hair sieve and pour into 
a buttered mould ; cook d bainrmarie (the water rising to 
half the height of the mould) until of the proper consis- 
tency (i. ^., like soft bread); when cold cut into small 
squares and arrange in a heated soup tureen, adding, also, 
the points of some white asparagus, cooled in water (the 
asparagus should be hot) ; pour over these the soup, and 
serve.

then, put the stock on the fire ; add the white of egg and 
shell instantly, while the stock is still cold ; stir steadily 
and uninterruptedly until the stock is very hot to keep the 
egg from settling ; then leave it and let it boil ten min- 
utes. By this time a thick scum will have formed; set 
the stock back on the stove, and add half a cup of cold 
water ; let it stand ten minutes, while you prepare your 
jar, colander, and fine napkin ready for straining ; wring 
a fine napkin out of hot water, and lay it over the colan- 
der (which should be placed on the jar) ; put the finest

do this slowly, and do not squeeze the napkin at any stage 
of the process." 

The autlior of tlie "Boston Cook-book" advises that 
soup should never be shimmed^ and is undoubtedly right 
in so advising.

— Remove the fat from one quart of the water in which 
a chicken has been boiled to rags ; season highly with cel- 
ery salt and white pepper, also a little onion, and put on 
to boil ; mash the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs fine, and 
mix with half a cup of bread or cracker crumbs, which 
have been soaked until soft in a little milk ; chop the white 
meat of a chicken until fine like meal, and stir it into the 
egg-and-bread paste ; add one pint of hot cream slowly, 
and then rub all into the hot chicken liquor ; boil five min- 
utes ; add more salt if needed, and if too thick add more 
cream ; or, if not thick enough, add more fine cracker 
dust. It should be like ^ puree.

44 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Fish^ to Choose. — In choosing flounders, see that the 
pale side has the appearance of white earthenware. If 
clear and curly, the fish is not good. 

Bass should be sounded over the back. If the back 
sinks about the second dorsal fin, do not buy it. Bass, if 
gutted at once, and hung by the head in a cool place, will 
remain good for two or three days without salt. 

Eels are fresh when their skin is full ; if wrinkled, they 
are stale. Pickerel should have an olive-tinted skin, and 
golden spots. If the coloring be pale and faded, the pick- 
erel are stale. Trout should have a small head, thick 
shoulders, and a general splendor of coloring. If pale in 
color, they are stale. Salmon shquld be round and broad, 
even to the tail. If covered with parasitical insects, that 
is a sure sign of its having just come out of the water, and 
of a very high condition bf excellence. As long as the 
scales are resplendent and silvery the fish are in a good, 
eatable state ; just as soon as a coppery hue appears they 
are no longer fit to eat. In choosing "crimped salmon," 
see that the flesh rises at the edges of the cuts^ disclosing 
firm, elastic flakes. When the fish is stale, the gills turn 
brown, and dishonest fishmongers stain them with blood ; 
but this trick is easily detected by those who are aware of 
it. Always buy crabs and lobsters alive^ heavy, and lively. 

Salt Fish^ to Choose. — Salt cod should be perfectly dry, 
not hard to the touch, and completely free from spots or 
mildew. Dried salmon should be thick and full-backed, 
and the flesh of a deep pink color. If dim red, this color 
has been given by saltpetre to a colorless, unhealthy fish. 
Red herring should shine like burnished metal, and be 
very stiff ; if they are dull, soft, or broken, they are not 
good. 

All fish kept in pickle should be clean in appearance 
and firm and elastic to the touch. 

Fish^ to Cleam. — Fish should be carefully and thor- 



FISH. 45 

oughlj cleaned, but sbonld be lightly and rapidly bandied, 
or the flesh will lose its firmness and delicacy. After be- 
ing thoroughly and quickly washed under a pipe of run- 
ning water, it should be hung by the head until every drop 
is drained off. Never leave fish lying in water. 

Cod should be very carefully cleaned, all the interstices 
of the backbone being freed from blood either with a 
knife or a small brush. Unless this is done the blood 
turns black in boiling, producing a* most disgusting ap- 
pearance. 

Bays, and all fishes of that class, should be skinned as 
soon after they are dead as possible. If the skin does not 
come off readily, dip the fish in boiling water. 

Fish that are to be opened down the back are best split 
from nose to tail. 

In cleaning fiatfish, open them considerably, otherwise 
it is hard to extract the whole of the intestines ; and it is 
this neglect which makes the abdominal parts of flatfish 
have such an unpleasant, muddy taste. 

General Directions for Boiling. — Large fish are gener- 
ally boiled, and it is well to add a little salt, vinegar, and 
horseradish to the water, as the addition not only pre- 
vents the skin of the fish from breaking, but really im- 
proves the fiavor. Large fish must be boiled slowly. The 
head and shoulders of the cod are the parts generally best 
for boiling. It is best to bind them with broad tape. 
When sufficiently cooked, the fiesh will leave the backbone 
white and fiaky, the skin rises up, and the eyes turn white. 
The sounds, the jelly parts about the jowl, the palate, and 
the tongue, are esteemed rare delicacies by the epicures in 
fish. 

Salmon, also, if it be a large fish, is best boiled in por- 
tions. After it has been a minute in the boiling water, 
lift the drain and let the water fiow off. Eepeat this sev- 
eral times, and it will cause the curd to set, and the fish to 
eat more crisply. The thinnest part of salmon is the fat- 



46 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

test, and consequently the best part. Some epicures, 
notably William Henry Herbert, recommend for boiling 
salmon "a kettle screeching with intense heat, and filled 
with brine strong enough to bear an egg." 

Brook Trout are generally fried or broiled, but the lake 
trout found in Hamilton County, Seneca Lake, etc., are 
best boiled. 

Frying Fish — General Directions, — Small fish* are usu- 
ally best fried. The fire should always be clear and fierce, 
and the pan must not be too old, or the fish will stick to 
it. Beef drippings is the best thing in which to fry fish, 
and plenty of it must be used. The drippings must be so 
hot that a piece of bread dropped into it will brown in- 
stantly. 

In frying herring or shad, score them three or four 
times across the body into the very backbone. This mode 
of treatment causes the flesh to be more crisp and firm.. 
After the fish are fried they should be laid on a soft cloth 
before the fire, and turned every two or three minutes till 
dry on hoth sides. It is well to keep old linen table-cloths 
cut up for this purpose. 

Fried Catfish. — Skin, clean, remove the heads, sprinkle 
with salt, and lay aside for an hour and a half. Then dip 
in beaten eggs, roll in bread or cracker crumbs, and fry 
quickly in hot lard or drippings. 

Stewed Catfish. — Skin, clean, remove the heads, salt, 
and set aside, as for frying. After two hours arrange them 
in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and stew gently for 
half an hour or longer, according to their size. Put into 
the saucepan a chopped shallot, a bunch of chopped pars- 
ley, a little pepper, a tablespoonf ul of browned flour mixed 
to a paste with cold water, and a heaping tablespoonf ul of 
butter. Boil up once, take out the fish carefully, and lay 



FISH. 47 

in a deep dish. Boil up again, pour over the fish, and 
serve. 

Brandade de Morue. — Soak yonr codfish until it be- 
comes flaky ; drain it well (for this dish you always use a 
salt cod ; shred your fish ; pound it piece by piece in a 
raortar with a little clove of well-pounded garlic ; stir into 
it (always stirring the same way, and drop by drop) a glass 
of olive-oil. Then put your fish in a saucepan on a slow 
fire, and continue to stir in the oil drop by drop; add oc- 
casionally a little sweet milk, until the fish has the consist- 
ency of cream cheese. Serve it in a dish surrounded by 
croutons of bread fried in butter. 

Codfish di la Provenqale, — Boil and drain your fish ; take 
a dish you can set on the fire, slice some eschalottes and 
an onion ; chop up some parsley ; add a little olive-oil and 
a piece of butter as large as an egg. Lay your fish in 
this; cover it with a layer of this same dressing; season 
with salt and pepper; cover with bread crumbs, and bake 
with fire above and below. 

Fresh Codfish^ Boiled, — ^Lay the fish in cold water 
slightly salted for half an hour ; wipe it dry ; wrap it in a 
clean linen cloth well floured, stitched to the shape of the 
fish, and put it into the fish-kettle with water enough to 
cover it. The water should be slightly salted. Boil brisk- 
ly, allowing an hour from the time the water fairly boils 
for a piece of cod weighing three pounds. If boiled with- 
out the cloth, half an hour. Drain, and serve on a very 
hot dish with old-fashioned egg sauce ; garnish with pars- 
ley and slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

S(dt Codfijsh^ Boiled. — Put the fish to soak in lukewarm 
water for at least sixteen or seventeen hours before cook- 
ing. Change the water after two hours, then again after 
nine hours, washing oflE the salt. Two hours before din- 



48 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

ner take out the cod, remove any crystal of salt adhering 
to it, and plunge into very cold water. Finally, set over 
the fire with enough lukewarm water to cover it, and boil 
half an hour; drain well, serve on a hot dish with sliced 
beets and hard-boiled eggs; drench with egg sauce and 
serve. 

Codfish Balls, — Prepare the fish precisely as for boiling 
whole. When duly washed and soaked, cut into pieces, 
and boil twenty minutes more ; drain very dry, and spread 
upon a disli to cool. When cold, pick to pieces with a 
fork, removing every vestige of skin and bone, and shred- 
ding very fine ; add an equal bulk of mashed potatoes, a 
beaten egg^ a lump of butter, and a little rich milk ; flour 
your hands, form the codfish into round, fiat cakes, and fry 
in good drippings to a light brown. Desiccated codfish is 
equally good, more quickly prepared, and as cheap. 

Salt Cofffi^h^ Stewed with Eggs. — Prepare as for balls. 
Heat almost to boiling a pint of rich, sweet milk, and stir 
into it gradually three eggs well beaten, a tablespoonful 
of butter, a little chopped parsley and butter, and, lastly, 
the fish; boilup once, and turn into a deep dish lined 
with buttered toast. 

Codfish Pie. — Take a piece of the middle of a small 
cod ; salt it well one night ; next day wash it, and season 
with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; put 
it into a deep dish with a little butter and good broth ; 
cover with a crust, making an aperture in the crust, and, 
when the pie is baked, pour in through this aperture a 
sauce composed of one spoonful of stock, a quarter of a 
pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon 
and nutmeg, and, if obtainable, some oysters. The sauce 
should be allowed to boil up once before being poured 
into the pie. 



FISH. 49 

Shrvmp Pie. — A quart of shrimps well picked. If very 
salt season them with only mace and a clove 6r two ; skin, 
bone, and mince two or three anchovies ; mix these with 
the spice, and then season the shrimps ; put some butter 
in the bottom of a dish and cover the shrimps with a glass 
of sharp white wine. The paste must be light and thin. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

Chowder^ Mdssachusetia. — Five pounds of bass or cod cut 
into strips an inch thick and three long; six large onions 
fried in the gravy of fried pork ; oysters ; three cnps of 
oyster liquor; oyster crackei-s, well soaked in milk, and 
thickly buttered. 

Line the bottom of the pot with a layer of fish ; scat- 
ter upon this a few slices of tlie fried onion, some salt, 
half a dozen whole black peppers, a clove or two, a pinch 
of thyme, and one of parsley, a tablespoon ful of mush- 
room catsup, and six oysters ; then a layer of the soaked 
and buttered oyster crackera ; then fish, etc. Repeat the 
order already given until the pot is full ; cover with wa- 
ter, and, as the water boils, add the oyster liquor. This is 
delicious chowder. 

Chowder y Rhode Island, — Four pounds of cod or sea 
bass, cut into pieces four inches square ; one pound of salt 
pork, cut into strips, and soaked in hot water five minutes; 

Cover the bottom of the chowder pot with a layer of 
the pork ; place on this a layer of fish, then a layer of 
chopped onions, a little summer savory, parsley, and cay- 
enne ; then a layer of split cream crackers, moistened with 
warm water ; above this lay a stratum of pork ; and then 
again fish, onions, seasoning, and crackers. Repeat this 
order until the dish is full ; let the last layer of crackers 
be well buttered ; pour in barely enough water to cover 
all ; cover the pot ; stew gently for an hour, watching that 
the water does not sink too low. Should it leave the up- 
per layer exposed, replenish carefully from the boiling tea-

kettle; when thoroughly cooked take out the chowder 
and put into the tureen ; thicken the gravy with a table- 
spoonful of flour and the same of butter; boil up once, 
and pour over the chowder. 

SL Jame^9 Club Chowder. — Six slices of good pickled 
pork, fried brown on both sides ; seven pounds of tautog, 
dressed, with the heads on, and each fish cut into three 
pieces; pepper and salt to taste; plenty of onions, sliced 
and chopped ; two pounds of sea biscuits ; one quart bot- 
tle of the best champagne ; one tumblerful of port wine. 

Fry the pork in a deep dinner-pot ; when fried take out 
the pork, leaving the drippings, and put on the drippings 
as many pieces of fish as will make a smooth layer ; throw 
on the fish three handfuls of onions; salt and pepper to 
taste ; then put on the six slices of pork ; then the rest of 
the fish ; then, again, a layer of onions ; pepper and salt 
to taste ; then pour on just enough water to cover all ; put 
the cover on the pot ; place it on the fire ; let it boil gen- 
tly and slowly for thirty minutes. It is to boil, actually 
hoU thirty minutes, and should at all events cook until the 
onion is soft ; put in at this point a quart bottle of the 
best champagne, a tumblerful of equally good port wine, 
and two pounds of sea biscuits, soaked for a moment or 
two in boiling water ; then stir up all with a long spoon, 
and let all loU again for five minutes ; then taste, add 
pepper and salt if necessary, and dish. Potatoes may be 
eaten with chowder, but should always be boiled in a 
separate pot. 

Clam Chx)wder, — Five or six slices of fat pork, fried 
crisp, and chopped fine ; sprinkle in the bottom of a pot ; 
place on the pork a layer of clams ; sprinkle with cayenne 
pepper and salt, and scatter bits of butter thickly over all ; 
then have a layer of chopped onions, then one of small 
crackers, split and moistened with warm milk ; over all 
this pour a little of the fat left in the pan in which the 



FISH. 51 

pork is fried ; then proceed as above until the pot is full, 
or nearly so ; cover with water and stew, closely covered, 
for three quarters of an hour ; drain off all the liquor that 
will flow freely ; and when you have turned the chowder 
into the tureen, pour the gravy back into the pot ; thicken 
with cracker crumbs, browned and rolled ; add a glass of 
sherry wine, some catsup, and spiced sauce ; boil up once 
and pour over the chowder. 

ScdllopSy Fried. — If you do not buy the scallops pre- 
pared, boil them and take out the hearts. The heart is the 
only part fit for frying or stewing. Dip in beaten egg, 
roll in crumbs, and fry in hot lard or dripping. 

Baw dams. — The small Little Neck clams are excellent 
raw ; serve in the shell, as you do raw oysters. 

Boast (Jlams. — ^Proceed as for roast oysters. 

Clam Fritters, — Twelve clams, chopped fine ; one pint 
of milk ; three eggs. 

Pour the liquor from the clams into the milk ; add to 
this the beaten eggs, salt and pepper to taste, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter; fry in hot lard by table- 
spoonfuls. 

•Scalloped Clams. — Chop the clams fine, and season with 
pepper and salt ; then place in another dish some rolled 
bread crumbs, moistened with milk, clam liquor, and melt- 
ed butter ; stir the clams into this ; then serve in patty- 
pans, or clean buttered clam shells, after baking in the 
oven. 

CourtbouiUon d la Crhle^ No. 1. — Slice and fry some 
onions in a saucepan ; add slices of tomatoes, salt, and pep- 
per ; clean and scale your fish ; cut it in slices ; put it in 
tjie saucepan with the onions and tomatoes and some wa- 



62 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

ter; add a little chopped parsley; cook till the fish ia 
done; then add a glass of claret or white wine, whichever 
you prefer ; let it boil up, and take out the slices of fish ; 
place each slice on a piece of toasted bread, skim the sauce 
and pour over, and serve. 

Creole Cour^ouiUon for Fish^ No. 2. — Clean your fish 
and draw it through the gills; put it in a fish boiler; cov- 
er it well with water ; add a glass of vinegar, salt, pepper, 
clove, laurel leaf, onions and carrots sliced, thyme, and 
parsley; let it boil until the fish is done; remove the fish 
boiler to the back of the stove, and leave your fish in the 
courtbouillon till you are ready to serve it. The same 
courtbouillon can serve as often as it keeps good. You 
can substitute wine for vinegar — using half wine and half 
water. 

Fish au courtbouillon should be served very hot on a 
folded napkin on a dish surrounded by bunches of parsley. 

Oriole Courtbouillon for Sea Fish, No. 3. — Boil in 
half water and half milk ; salt and pepper. The fish 
becomes white and firm. Serve with highly seasoned 
sauces. 

Stuffed Crabs ci la Creole, — Boil your hard-shell crabs ; 
remove the shells ; take out the sand bag and the spongy 
substances from the sides ; take out the meat and fat care- 
fully, and chop them up with chopped onions, minced 
ham, bread crumbs, butter or oils, suet, and plenty of red 
pepper ; bind it with beaten yolk of egg, and fry it well ; 
clean the upper shell of the crab, and stuff it with this 
crab stuflSng; sprinkle over a little bread crumbs (pow- 
dered) ; put on each stuffed crab a lump of butter, and 
return it to the stove to bake a few minutes, and 
serve. 

Cr<jih Croquettes are made in the same manner; serve in 



FISH. 53 

silver scallop shells, or powder them with bread crumbs, 
and fry them in boiling lard or oil. 

Croquettes of lobster may be made in the same manner. 

SoftrsheU Crdbs (Italian Monastery). — Take some ten- 
der, healthy, living crabs; wash and clean them thorough- 
ly, and put them in a deep dish, pan, or bowl which you 
have previously lilled with fresh milk or cream in which 
two or three eggs are beaten up; leave the crabs in this 
for two hours, in which time they will probably have eat- 
en all the milk and egg, and bo so fat as to be quite tor- 
pid and motionless; then dip them in beaten Qg'g^ roll 
them in bread crumbs, and fry quickly in butter; garnish 
with fried paisley, pour a little lemon juice over them^ 
and serve. 

RooHt Codfish (Monastery of Certosa). — Take a large, 
fresh codfish ; remove the head, scales, fins, and tail ; open 
and clean it thoroughly ; sprinkle the inside thinly and 
evenly with white pepper, powdered parsley, two large 
truffles very thinly sliced, one very small onion thinly 
sliced, some grated and browned bread crumbs ; moisten 
the whole with melted butter, in which you have beaten 
up a teaspoonful of any piquant bottled sauce. This done, 
roll up the codfish tightly and neatly, binding it firmly 
with twine, again bathing it thoroughly with the melted 
batter, prepared as above, and covering it with grated 
bread crumbs. This done, put it on the spit, and roast it 
before a clear, slow fire for an hour, basting it frequently 
with the melted butter and browned bread crumbs. When 
cooked place it in a very hot dish, pour over it the remain- 
der of the sauce with which it was basted, and the juice 
of two lemons; sprinkle it with a little grated parsley, 
garnisli with alternate slices of lemon and pickled beets, 
and serve. It will be found delicious. Plain boiled pota- 
toes should be served with it. 



64 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Roast Sturgeon (Italian Monastery). — Prepare a sauce 
in the following manner: Put into a casserole a large 
piece of good butter, a pinch of flour (browned), salt, 
pepper, parsley, onion, sweet herbs, spice, and a tiny piece 
of red pepper. The casserole should previously have 
been rubbed with garlic. Add to the mixture a large 
glass of cold water and half a glass of the best vine- 
gar; let all cook together, stirring it continually, either 
with a silver or a wooden spoon. When the mixture is 
thoroughly assimilated take it from the fire, and as soon 
as it is lukewarm, drop into it the thick slices of sturgeon. 
They must, of course, have been previously thoroughly 
cleaned and trimmed. Leave the pieces of sturgeon in 
the above-named sauce for three houi-s or more; then take 
them out, let them drain, put them on the spit, and let 
\hem roast before a slow fire, basting them continually 
with the sauce ; arrange in a very hot dish, when cooked, 
and garnish with slices of lemon. 

MuUets or SmaU Fish d la Livornese. — Choose small 
red mullets or other pan fish, taking care that they should 
not be more than four or five inches long. When thor- 
oughly cleaned arrange them in an earthen stewpan with 
a tiny pinch of garlic, the very finest quality of olive-oil 
(or good butter), a little fennel, parsley, and thyme; when 
partly cooked add a fair quantity of good tomato sauce. 
Before serving sprinkle well with the finest grated and 
browned bread crumbs. 

Mullets^ White Bait^ or other Pan Fish^ with Sauce 
Piquante, — Arrange, as before, in an earthen stewpan, 
putting in delicate young onions finely chopped, and a 
sufiicient quantity of the best olive-oil (or good butter); 
moistening all with broth, or, better still, with fish broth, 
and a glass of sweet white wine. Just before serving add 
to this any kind of b^wqq piquante, (Very good.) 



PISH. 66 

Carp di la Charribord, — Take a large, fine, male carp ; 
cleanse thoroughly, bone, and stuff with a mixture of 
minced fish, butter, bread crumbs, and grated parsley; 
then cover it with thin slices of ham and fat bacon, wrap 
it in well-buttered white paper, and bind the whole neatly 
and firmly with thread ; place it in a fish kettle with two 
or three glasses of good white wine, delicate young onions 
chopped fine, thyme, laurel, celery seed, spices, salt, and 
pepper, taking care every now and then to baste and turn 
the fish so that it may be thoroughly soaked and impreg- 
nated by the sauce. It shoiild boil slowly for an hour, 
with fire below and above it ; then take it from the fire, 
let it drain, remove carefully the paper and threads, and 
arrange the carp daintily in a very hot dish; garnishing 
it with tiny fish, truffles, slices' of lemon, prawns, crawfish, 
slices of fried bread cut into pretty shapes, etc., pour* 
round it the best kind of white sauce, to which has been 
added the sauce in which it was cooked. It should be 
served very hot. 

Stewed Eds, — Skin and clean the eels, carefully extract- 
ing the fat from the inside ; cut into lengths of an inch 
and a half, put into a saucepan with enough cold water 
to cover them, throw in a little salt and chopped parsley, 
and stew slowly, carefully covered, for an hour ; add, at 
the last, a large tablespoonful of butter, the same of 
browned flour mixed with cold water, a wineglassful of 
sherry, and a quarter of a lemon cut into the thinnest 
possible slices. 

Fried -Ee&.— Prepare as for stewing, roll in flour, and 
fry in hot lard or butter to a fine brown. 

Leisters Boiled. — Lobsters for boiling should be lively, 
and not too large. Tie the claws together, put a handful 
of salt in the boiling water, and plunge in your lobster ; 
boil from half an hour to an hour, according to size ; when

done remove from the pot, and lay — face downward — on 
a sieve to dry ; when cold split open the body and tail, ex- 
tract the meat from the claws, and throw away the lady 
fingers and the head. 

Lobster Ci'oquettes. — The meat of a well-boiled lobster 
chopped fine, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and pow- 
dered mace; mix this with a quarter of the quantity of 
rolled bread crumbs, and two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter; make into oval balls; roll these in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs, then fry in butter; serve very 
hot 

Lobster d la Bordelaiae, — Boil your lobster in water 
with three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, slices of carrots, on- 
ions, a bay leaf, a clove of garlic, salt, and pepper ; let it 
boil a few moments ; take off the shell and cut it across in 
eight pieces ; break the claws and put them in a saucepan 
with some white wine, a soup bunch, salt, and pepper; 
cover the saucepan and let it simmer ten minutes; fry 
some chopped onions in butter in another saucepan, add a 
spoonful of flour, make a roux^ and pour it in the sauce- 
pan in which you have cooked the lobster claws ; let it 
cook a few minutes, stirring continually with a wooden 
spoon ; add two tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, and cay- 
enne pepper; put your slices of lobster in this, let them 
warm through, and serve liot. 

Hot Lobster (William Makepeace Thackeray). — Pull 
about three pounds of boiled lobster to. pieces with two 
silver forks; make a sauce of mustard, vinegar, tomato 
catsup, and plenty of cayenne pepper and salt; put lob- 
ster, sauce, and half a pound of good fresh butter into a 
chafing-dish ; close or cover the chafing-dish tightly, and 
when the lobster begins to cook, open the chafing-dish 
and stir quickly with a silver spoon ; cook twenty min- 
utes, if necessary; and two minutes before blowing out 



FISH. 67 

the fire under the chafing-dish, open it for a moment, and 
throw in a wineglassful of good sherry, stirring quickly, 
as before. " This is a dish fit for an emperor." 

Potted Lobster, — ^Half boil the lobsters, pick out the 
meat, cut into small bits, season with mace, white pepper,

with butter, bake half an hour, and put the spawn in ; when 
cold take the lobster out, and pack into small jars with a 
little of the butter ; beat the other butter in a mortar with 
some of the spawn ; then mix that colored butter with as 
much as will be sufficient to cover the pots, and strain it. 
Cayenne may be added if approved. 

Curry of Lobsters or Pravms. — Parboil, take them from 
the shells, and lay in a pan with a small piece of mace,* 
three or four spoonfuls of veal gravy, and four of cream ; 
rub smooth one or two teaspoonfuls of curry-powder, a 
teaspoonful of flour, and an ounce of butter; simmer an 
hour; salt to taste, and squeeze in the juice of half a 
lemon.

six pounds; soak in salt and water for two hours; wipe 
dry and score the skin in squares; bake in a tolerably hot 
oven for an hour, basting often with butter and water ; 
test with a silver fork ; if the fork penetrate easily it is 
done. It should be of a fine brown. Add to the gravy 
in the dripping-pan a tablespoonful of walnut catsup, the 
juice of a lemon, and a teaspoonful of Worcestershire 
sauce; thicken with browned flour, boil up once, and pour 
over the halibut ; serve in a very hot dish.

sauce ; a soupqon of anchovy paste ; a small teacupf ul of 
celery vinegar. 

Work all this smoothly into a rich dressing, with enough 
cream to give it the consistency of mayonnaise; stir it into 
the minced fish ; heap in a mound, and garnish with curled 
lettuce, whites of eggs cut into rings, and rounds of pick- 
led beets. 

Mamies Scalloped Hdlihut. — Boil the fish, and when 
quite cold shred finely; make a rich sauce as follows: 
Yolk of one egg, beaten up with two tablespoonf uls of 
sifted flour ; half a pint of rich milk. 

Put into a saucepan, and stir constantly over the fire 
until smooth and thick; do not let it boil; add salt to

Boiled Mdckerd, — Clean the mackerel, and wipe care- 
fully with a dry, clean cloth ; wash them lightly with an- 
other cloth dipped in vinegar; wrap in a coarse linen 
cloth, floured, basted closely to the shape of the fish ; put 
into a pot, cover with salted water, and boil gently half 
an hour ; drain well, and serve on a hot dish with egg 
sauce, or any sauce you prefer. 

Broiled Mackerel (Salt). — Soak over-night in lukewarm 
water; change this early in the morning for very cold, 
and let it lie in this until it is time to cook ; then clean 
thoroughly, and wipe quite dry ; split open and lay on a 
buttered gridiron over a clear fire ; when it begins to 
brown turn the other side ; lay on a hot dish, butter plen- 
tifully, and cover for a few moments. 

lioast Pike. — Prepare and draw your fish, lard it well, 
split it, baste it while roasting with white wine, vinegar, 
or lemon juice, and serve it with a rich sauce, in which

sprinkle it with salt and pepper^ envelop it in bnttered 
paper, broil it on a gridiron, and serve it with a mwUre 
d^h6td sauce. 

Broiled Mackerel d la CrkHe, No. 2, — Clean and pre- 
pare your fish j split it in the back; wrap it in oiled paper, 
and broil it on the gridiron. Just before serving, remove 
the paper, and put in the fish a lump of fresh butter, in 
which you have kneaded some paraley, $alt, and pepper. 
The heat of the fish melts the butter. 



Stuffed Trout — Prepare your fish ; make a stuflSng of 
mushrooms, scraps of fish, crumbs of bread, onions, salt, 
and pepper, chopped up with butter. Stuff your fish with 
this ; tie them up carefully, and cook them in a court- 
bouillon ; drain them, and let them cool ; dip them 
twice in beaten eggs ; fry them, and serve with a tomato 
sauce.

Baked MuTUL — Scale and trim the fish, and put it into 
a frying-pan ; season with pepper and salt ; cover with 
chopped onions and mushrooms ; moisten with a wineglass- 
ful of sherry and a little butter; bake it over a slow fire for 
twenty minutes if a medium-sized fish; keep well basting 
in the liquor, and turn now and then ; disli up very care- 
fully. Make a sauce with half a glassful of sherry, a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, and twelve drops of anchovy 
sauce. Ueduce the gravy to one half by boiling, and pour 
over the fish. 

Oysters^ to Feed, — Put them into water, and wash with 
a birch besom until quite clean; then lay them round, side 
downwards, in a pan ; sprinkle with flour or oatmeal and 
salt, and cover with water ; do the same every day and 
they will fatten. The water should be pretty salt, and 
rather more so than sea water. Bay salt is the best for 
the purpose when it is at hand. 

Oyster Loaves, — Open the oysters; save their liquor, 
strain it, and then put the oysters to stew in it with a very 
little butter and flour, white pepper, a pinch of nutmoir, 
and a little cream; stew till tender, and then cut tho 
oysters into dice and stuff small hollowed rolls of bread 
with them ; put on a hot dish ; pour over the rolls tho 
sauce in which the oysters were cooked, and serve. 

Bow Oysters. — Raw oysters when first served for a din- 
ner which is carved on the table should be placed in their 
shellsy on a block of ice, in the centre of the table, 

When the dinner is carved and served from side tables, 
the oysters should be served in, small plates of ice, of 
course in their shells. Raw oysters. are never removed 
from their shells. These plates should be placed on folded 
napkins. If the ice platies cannot be obtained, oyster 
plates should be used. Sliced lemon should be invariably 
served with oysters, but no sauce of any kind. The $erv- 



62 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

ing of raw oysters on ice, is, of course, a matter of taste. 
Oyster plates are equally available, and in the opinion of 
many dinner-givers much prettier, but the oysters should 
always be kept on the ice beforehand. 

Oyster Patties, — Stew the oysters, as for oyster stew, 
taking care, however, to make the sauce much thicker. 
Have ready some small shells of puff paste which have 
been heated on a tin. Fill these shells with the oysters, 
set for a moment in the oven, and serve very hot. 

Oyster Fritters. — Drain the liquor from the oysters, and 
add to it an equal quantity of milk (in the proportion of 
cup to cup), three eggs, a little salt, and flour enough for 
a thin batter. Have ready in the frying pan a few spoon- 
fuls of boiling lard ; try it, to be assured that it is sufli- 
ently hot, and drop the oyster batter in by the spoonful ; 
fry quickly a light brown ; drain on white paper, and 
send to table. 

Cream Oysters on Half-sheU. — Cook together d bain- 
marie one cup of oyster juice, one of milk, and one of 
cream, with a little salt. When it boils, stir in two table-« 
spoonfuls of butter, a little salt, and some white pepper ; 
have ready some fine large oyster shells, washed and but- 
tered, and with a fine oyster in each ; range them closely 
in a large baking-pan ; take the cream from the fire, and 
stir in two tablespoon fuls of rice flour mixed with cold 
milk ; replace the casserole on the fire, stir very hard ; 
remove from the fire, and fill up the oyster shells with the 
cream ; bake five or six minutes in the oven after the 
shells become warm. 

Boast Oysters. — Wash and wipe the shells, and lay them 
in a quick oven, or on the top of the stove. When they 
open they are done. Pile on a large dish and send to 



FISH. 63 

table. Eeraove the upper shell with a knife ; season 
with pepper, salt, and butter, or milk. 

Or, open while raw, leaving the oysters on the lower 
shells ; lay in a large baking-pan, and roast in their shells, 
adding butter, pepper, and salt, before serving. 

Oyster Omelette. — One dozen of large oysters, chopped 
fine; six eggs, well beaten ; two ounces of melted butter; 
pepper and salt to taste.

eggs, oystere, and seasoning, beating all well together; fry 
like any other omelette, and, just before it is put into the 
pan, add a teaspoonful of chopped pareley in a tablespoon- 
fnl of melted butter. 

Oyster Pie. — One quart of oysters ; one cup of milk ; 
two eggs, well beaten ; two spoonfuls of butter ; salt, pep- 
per, and nutmeg- Bake in a deep dish, in a good rich crust. 

Baltimore Oyster Pie. — Make a puff paste of one pound 
of butter, flaked into one pound of sifted flour, wet to a 
stiff dough with ice water, and rolled out on a marble slab, 
or in a very cold room. Handle it as little as possible. 
Line the sides of a deep dish, holding more than two 
quarts, with this paste. Having stripped the oysters, 
season them thoroughly with pepper, salt, and a blade or 
two of mace ; cut up six ounces of butter into little bits, 
and stir through the oysters, with half a teacupful of 
grated bread; then strain the oyster liquor carefully, 
and put all into a dish ; cover it with paste, rolled about 
one fourth of an inch thick, with an opening in the centre; 
cut out with a cake cutter, or jagging iron, ornamental 
bits of paste, and arrange around the edge, and above the 
opening ; bake in a hot oven, from half to three quarters 
of an hour. If the crust browns too quickly cover with 
paper. Just before the pie is done pour in a teacupful 



64 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

of cream through the aperture in the top. Two quarts of 
oysters make a good pie. 

Fricasseed Oysters. — Scald fifty oysters in their own 
juice, carefully skimming off the scum. Strain off and 
reject the juice ; put the oysters into a hot covered tureen, 
and set it aside in a warm place; rub well together six 
ounces of butter; three tablespoonfuls of flour, with as 
much scalding milk, into a fine, smooth paste; stir this 
mixture into a quart of hot milk in a stewpan on the fire ; 
season it with salt and pepper, and a very little ground 
allspice and mace ; stir it until it thickens ; then stir in 
four well-beaten yolks of eggs, taking care that tl:e mix- 
ture is not hot enough to curdle the eggs ; pour this over 
the oysters in the baking-dish ; cover them thickly with 
fresh bread crumbs, and brown in a quick oven. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Put a layer of bread crumbs with 
butter in the bottom of a dish ; then a layer of oysters, 
and so on, alternating, until the dish is full. Use pepper, 
and, if the oysters are fresh, salt ; when the dish is full, 
add a gill of wine; bake twenty minutes. 

Scalloped Oysters on the Half'SheU.-T-'FiW the deep sides 
of large oyster shells with oysters and bread or cracker 
crumbs, prepared with small bits of butter, and spice and 
^alt to taste ; place the shells in a pan, and bake them a 
short time in the oven. Clams, with the hard parts re- 
moved, may be treated in the same manner. 

Fried Oysters, — Use only the largest oysters for frying. 
Wipe them dry witli a cloth; dip each one separately 
into beaten egg and cracker, or stale bread crumbs, or 
Indian meal ; fry quickly in boiling lard.

salad bowl, and cover them with a rich, creamy salad 
dressing. 

Boiled Oysters. — Wash the oysters very clean; put 
them in a wire basket, and immerse the basket in a pot 
of boiling water. The moment the shells open, remove 
the basket from the water ; take off the upper shells, and 
serve them on large dishes, hot, in the lower shell. 

To Broil (?y«^r5.— Select the largest and finest oysters. 
Dry them in a towel, and season them with pepper and 
$alt ; lay them inside of a folding wire broiler ; turn 
the broiler frequently from side to side to keep the juice 
from flowing out ; have ready a very hot dish, and, as 
you place the oysters upon it, put little pieces of butter 
on them, and serve at once. 

Steamed Oysters. — Drain the oysters well, washing each 
one in the liquor to remove the pieces of shell ; put them 
in a tin plate inside of a steamer already placed over a pot 
of water that is boiling ; cover the steamer tight with its 
lid, and have the oysters in the hot steam until they puff 
up and curl. Serve on a hot covered dish, with butter, 
salt, and pepper. 

Panned Oysters. — Drain the oysters, and put them on 
the fire in a hot place, with pepper and salt. When the 
oysters are puffed, pour them into a hot dish with somo 
lumps of butter. 

Griddled Oysters. — Take the largest and finest oysters ; 
dry them in a cloth ; heat the griddle as for baking cakes, 
and grease it ; have close to the fire a dish with butter, 
pepper, and salt in it; lay the oysters on the griddle, 
they will brown almost immediately ; brown on both

a colander; when washed and drained, put them in a 
saucepan with a little salt, and a large blade of mace; 
let them stand on a cool part of the range for fifteen 
minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon; then add the 
butter and flour ; simmer five minutes ; add the cream 
and cayenne. When the oysters begin to curl they are 
cooked.

drain well, and then throw them into the hot spiced liquor; 
give them a quick boil, and set them away in a stone 
jar ; add salt, if the oysters are fresh ; do not cover them 
until cool. Before serving, add small angular pieces of 
lemon. 

PicJded Oysters. — As many oysters as will fill a gallon 
measure without the liquor ; wash them well in the liquor, 
removing all the shell ; strain the liquor, and cook the 
oysters in it, adding salt, if necessary ; let the oysters 
cook until the fins are well shrivelled ; then take out 
the oysters, and let them cool on large dishes ; add some 
mace and whole pepper to the liquor, carefully skimming

Boiled Salmon, — Wash and wipe the fish ; Avrap it in a 
clean linen cloth, kept expressly for this purpose ; baste it 
up securely, and put into the fish kettle ; cover with cold 
water, in which has been melted a handful of salt ; boil 
slowly, allowing a quarter of an hour to each pound ; when 
the time is up, rip open a corner of the cloth, and test the 
salmon with a silver or wooden fork; if it penetrate easily, 
it is done ; if not, sew up the cloth quickly, and cook until 
tender, skimming the scum as it rises. When the fish is 
done, take it instantly from the kettle, remove the cloth, 
lay for an instant on a clean cloth, until it has drained, 
transfer carefully to a very hot dish, and pour over it 
a sauce, which must be made in the following manner, 
while the salmon cooks:

drippings ; should it brown too fast, cover the top with a 
sheet of white paper ; when done, place on a hot dish, and 
cover closely, and add to the gravy in the dripping-pan a 
glassful of sherry, a spoonful of tomato sauce, the juice of 
a lemon, and a little hot water thickened with browned

one pint of the water in which the sahnon has boiled. 

Mix, put in an earthenware jar, cover, and set away. 
The salmon must previously have been .cleaned, and cut 
into pieces an inch and a half long and half an inch wide, 
and boiled in salted water ; when well boiled it should be 
drained, dried with a cloth, and set aside until the next 
day ; then put on the pickle over a brisk fire, and when it 
boils drop in the salmon very carefully; let the pickle 
boil up once again ; then set back the kettle on the range, 
fish out the salmon, and pack quickly and closely into 
glass jars ; fill with the boiling pickle until it overflows, 
screw down the top, and set in a cool, dark place. Salm- 
on so prepared will keep for years.

and lay in the baking-pan with just enough water to keep 
it from scorching; if large, score the backbone with a 
sharp knife ; bake slowly, basting often with butter and 
water. By the time it is cooked, have ready a cupful of 
cream diluted with a few spoonfuls of hot water, into

which has been stirred two tablespoon fuls of melted but- 
ter and a little chopped parsley ; heat this d bain-niariey 
add the gravy in the dripping-pan, boil up once to thick- 
en, and, when the trout has been laid in a very hot dish, 
pour the sauce round it ; garnish with curled lettuce. 

To Cook Salmon. — Salmon should, if boiled, be boiled 
in a regular fish-kettle and in salted water.. 

Or, it may be cut into steaks, and broiled on a buttered 
gridiron, over a clear tire. 

Oi> baked, following the receipt for baked shad, or for 
baked salmon-trout. 

Crabbed Rockjish, — Pick cold boiled rockfish into small 
pieces; put it in a stewpan with a gill of water; add 
salt, a large spoonful of white pepper, vinegar, a lump 
of butter, and a little cayenne pepper; shake over the fire 
until very hot. 

Barbecued Fish. — Clean the fish thoroughly, wipe it 
dry, and cut it across as if for frying ; salt it inside and 
outside, and lay it in a baking-dish ; strew over it a season- 
ing made of bread crumbs, parsley, sweet-marjoram, thyme, 
salt, pepper, and a few cloves; add two or three table- 
spoonfuls of water, and lay on top a large lump of butter ; 
bake it well, and just before serving add a teacnpful of 
port wine. 

Stewed Black Fish or Sea Bass. — Clean and scale the 
fish ; fry them whole, and then remove to a stewpan ; next 
pour some water into the frying-pan in which you have 
fried the fish, and thicken it with a little flour, mixed in 
cold water. When sufficiently cooked, throw this gravy 
over the fish and let it stew ; season it with cloves, mace, 
pepper, aud salt, and a little green parsley, chopped fine ; 
about twenty minutes before serving it add a gill of cat- 
sup, a little stewed tomato, and a gill of port wine.

Broiled Shad. — Prepare as above, and broil on a bat- 
tered gridiron over a clear fire ; rub well with bntter when 
done, diist with pepper and salt, and serve. 

Baked Shad, — Prepare as above ; make a rich bread 
stuffing, mixing it with egg, beaten light, pepper, salt, and 
a little mace ; stuff the shad, sew it up, put in a quick 
oven, and bake it ; serve with mushroom sauce. 

Boiled Shad. — When cleaned place the roe inside of it, 
and tie the fish firmly with several twists of cord ; roll it 
in a cloth, put in the fish-kettle, and boil twenty minutes ; 
serve with egg sauce. 

Sheepshead — Is best boiled, and served with sauce Hol- 
landaise. Cold boiled sheepshead, flaked and served with 
a mayonnaise dressing, is excellent. 

Shad Planked. — This is the best way of cooking fresh 
shad. It must be beheaded, well scaled and cleaned, cut 
entirely open, and laid with the outside next the plank. 
The plank must then be put (propped up) in front of the 
fire, and the shad broiled until thoroughly cooked through. 
Meanwhile the roe must be fried in a frying-pan. When 
the shad is removed from the plank rub some butter over 
it, and add a little salt and red pepper ; serve on a hot 
dish without delay. Heavy slabs of oak, with cross fasten- 
ings of wire, may be bought in all the large cities, for 
planking shad. 

Potted Shad. — Clean the fish well, reserving the roes to 
pot with the shad ; remove the heads and tails and split 
the fish in two; cut each half of the fish crosswise into 
three pieces ; rub each piece with salt and pepper ; lay the 
fish in a layer in the bottom of a jar; scatter over it on- 
ions and a few cloves and allspice ; then add another lay- 
er of fish with onions and spice, as before, and so on until 



FISH. 75 

the jar is full ; pour strong vinegar on the fish until they 
are covered ; cover the mouth of each jar with a piece of 
muslin and tie it ; then spread on the muslin a thick dough 
made of flour and water, pressing it in at the edges to 
keep in the steam ; set the jar in the oven after the bread 
lias been drawn, and let it remain five or six hours, or un- 
til the oven is cold. In cities this is best done at a bak- 
er's. The jars must be stone, as earthenware would be 
dangerous to use with vinegar. When cold take off the 
dough and cloth, and cover them with a plate. They are 
fit to eat as soon as cold. 

Sovsed liookjiah or Salmon. — Use the water in which 
the fish was boiled, regulating the quantity by that of the 
fish ; put the water on the fire with salt, white pepper, all- 
spice, a few cloves, and a blade or two of mace ; let it boil 
until the flavor of the spices is extracted ; when done add 
as much vinegar as there is liquor ; let the spices remain 
in it ; cut the flsh into pieces, put them in a stone jar, and 
pour the liquor over hot. This is a good way of treating 
fish. Soused fish will keep some days in cool weather. 

Fricasseed Haddoch. — Remove the bones, and cut the 
fish into small pieces ; put them in a saucepan with the 
skin side up and without any water ; sprinkle ground mace 
and salt and pepper on each layer; cover it, and cook for 
twenty minutes ; then add a quarter of a pound of butter, 
rolled in flour, and one cupful of sherry wine; let it re- 
main fifteen minutes longer on the fire. 

Haddock and Oysters, — Cut the fish in pieces, and put 
them into a saucepan with mace, pepper, and salt on each 
layer ; cover them with water, and stew gently for fifteen 
minutes ; then add a quarter of a pound of butter, and 
thicken with flour ; add to this one quart of oysters, with- 
out the liquor, and, as soon as the oysters are cooked^ half 
a cupful of sherry wine, and serve. 



76 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Corned Shad, — Clean the fish and prepare it for cook- 
ing; sprinkle well with salt, and set it away in a cold 
place. In the morning broil it, serving it with a little but- 
ter and red pepper. The roe must be fried. In a cool 
place a corned shad may be kept for two or tliree days. 

Salt shad must be soaked all night before being cooked. 

PicldedShad. — Clean the fish and split them in two, and 
wash-them in several waters until quite free from blood; 
rinse them in strong salt and water, and place them in a 
stone jar in layers, adding salt and saltpetre to each layer; 
fill the jar to three or four inches from the top, and be 
sure to have the fish quite covered with brine, putting a 
weight on them to keep them under it. 

Boiled Shrimps d la Creole, — Wash the shrimps care- 
fully, and boil theni in salt and water, to which you add 
several pods of ripe red pepper ; serve for breakfast ; heap 
the shrimps in the dish and serve, surrounded by crimped 
parsley. This is a famous New Orleans dish. 

Shrimps au Gratin d la Creole. — Boil your shrimps in salt 
and water, and peel them ; pnt a layer of butter, chopped 
parsley, salt, and pepper in a deep dish ; then a layer of 
shrimps ; cover with powdered bread crumbs, bake, and 
serve. 

PicMed . Shrimps d la Creole. — Boil and peel your 
shrimps and put them in a bottle; pour over them the 
best vinegar and spices. In twenty-four hours they are 
ready for use. 

Stephanies Fish d la Creole. — Scale and clean your fish; 
draw it through the gills ; put it in a fish-boiler ; cover it 
well with water ; add a glassful of vinegar, salt, and pepper, 
clove, laurel leaf, onions and carrots sliced, thyme, and 
parsley ; let it boil until the fish is done ; remove the fish- 



FISH. 77 

boiler to the back of the stove, and leave your fish in the 
courtbonillon till you are ready to servo it. If yon prefer 
you can substitute wine for vinegar, using Imlf wine and 
half water. Fish au couribouillon should be served very 
hot, in a folded napkin, on a dish surrounded by bunches 
of parsley, with a highly seasoned sauce. 

Shrimps Stewed in Tomatoes, — Boil your shrimps in salt 
and water; peel and take off the heads; slice some onions 
in a saucepan, with a little lard ; add sliced tomatoes, a 
little flour to thicken it; season with salt and cayenne 
pepper ; put your shrimps in this sauce ; cook a few mo- 
ments and serve. 

JFried Trout. — Clean, wash, and dry the fish; roll light- 
ly in flour, and fry in butter or clarified dripping ; let the 
fat be very hot, fry quickly to a delicate brown, and take 
up the instant they are done ; drain for a moment on a 
folded napkin, then arrange in a very hot dish and serve. 

Fried Pickerel, — Proceed as above. 

Fried Smelts or other Pan Fish. — Clean, wash, and dry 
the fish ; lay in a large dish, salt, and dredge with flour; 
have ready a frying-pan of hot dripping, lard, or butter; 
put in as many fish as the pan will hold without crowding, 
and fry to a light brown ; drain, and serve on a hot disli, 
garnished with fried parsley. 

Terrapms to Keep, — A supply of terrapins may be ob- 
tained in the autumn, and kept all winter, in a barrel or 
cask, in a cellar where they are not likely to freeze. They 
need not be fed, although they will be fatter, and conse- 
quently better, if you throw the kitchen waste into the 
barrel. As they become torpid in winter, examine them 
carefully from time to time to see if they are alive. Be- 
fore cooking them, put them into very strong salt and wa- 
ter for twenty-four hours. 



78 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Maryland Receipt for Cooking Terrapins. — Plunge the 
terrapins alive into boiling water, and let them remain un- 
til the sides and lower shell begin to crack — this will take 
less than an hour ; then remove them and Icit them get 
cold; take off the shell and outer skin, being careful to 
save all the blood possible in opening them. If there are 
eggs in them put them aside in a dish ; take all the inside 
out, and be very careful not to break the gall, which must 
be immediately removed, or it will make the rest bitter. 
It lies within the liver. Then cut up the liver and all the 
rest of the terrapin into small pieces, adding the blood and 
juice that have flowed out in cutting up; add half a pint 
of water ; sprinkle a little flour over them as you place 
them in the stewpan ; let them stew^ slowly ten minutes, 
adding salt, black and cayejone pepper, and a very small 
blade of mace; then add a gill of the best brandy and half 
a pint of the best sherry wine; let it simmer over a slow 
tire very gently. About ten minutes or so, before you 
are ready to dish them, add half a pint of rich cream, 
and half a pound of sweet butter, with flour, to prevent 
oiling; two or three minutes before taking them off the 
fire, peel the eggs carefully and throw them in whole. If 
there should be no eggs use the yolk of hen's eggs, hard 
boiled. This receipt is for four terrapins. 

Philadelphia Receipt for Cooking Terrapins. — Plunge 
the terrapins alive into boiling water; when dead take off 
the outside skin from the shells, and the nails from the 
claws; wash them in warm water, and boil them until 
they are quite tender and soft ; throw a handful of salt in 
the water ; when they are ready to be taken out take off 
the shells and pick them carefully, removing the sand-bag 
and gall without breaking them ; cut the meat and entrails 
into small pieces; place them in a porcelain-lined saucepan, 
adding the juice which has flowed in cutting them, but no 
water; season them with salt, cayenne and black pepper. 
To each terrapin allow a quarter of a pound of butter. 



FISH. 79 

mixed well with a handful of flour for thickening ; after 
stewing for a short time add four or five tablespoonfuls of 
cream, and half a pint of good Madeira wine to four ter- 
rapins. The yolks of two boiled eggs and one raw one 
may be added before serving. 

Stewed TerrapiixSj Eastern Shore, — Boil your terrapins 
until the shells become loose ; then take them oflE, careful- 
ly saving the liquor ; scrape the black skin off the meat, 
remove the gall, clean and chop up the entrails carefully, 
put them in a saucepan with the meat and liquor, pour in 
enough olive-oil to fry them well, season with salt and 
pepper (black and cayenne), and add the yolks of the tur- 
tle eggs; when well warmed through, and just before 
serving, pour in a teacupful of sherry or Madeira, and 
serve hot. 

Spanish Saicce for Fried Fish, — Pound a clove of gar- 
lic and two red-pepper pods which you have softened in 
hot water; thin it with a little water, pour it in a sauce- 
pan with some hot olive-oil, vinegar, and salt; fry your 
fish in this sauce. 

A Substitute for Terrapin! s Eggs. — Beat the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs in a mortar, and make them into a 
paste with one raw yolk ; roll into balls, and throw them 
into boiling water to harden. These are excellent if the 
terrapin eggs are deficient. 

A Delaware Receipt for Cooking Terrapins, — One doz- 
en of medium-sized terrapins; three quarters of a pound 
of butter; one tablespoonful of flour; one tablespoonful 
of mustard ; one teaspoonf ul of salt ; half a pint of good 
wine; yolks of six hard-boiled eggs; one teaspoonf ul of 
the best brandy ; one saltspoonf ul of cayenne. 

Plunge the terrapins alive into boiling water; at the 
end of half an hour begin to examine them ; some will 



80 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

take half an hour, some an hour and a quarter, to boil ten- 
der. While hot remove the skin, nails, head, gall-blad- 
der, and sand-bags ; open each terrapin carefully over a 
bowl to save the gravy ; chop the terrapins fine, and put 
one lialf of the livers with the meat into a deep bowl; 
cover it with wine and let it stand two or three hours ; rub 
the other half of the livers, the six eggs, and the butter 
well together until smooth ; add' the flour, mustard, and 
cayenne. The meat steeped in wine should be first put 
into the stewpan, the dressing added, and be stirred con- 
stantly. They should only come to a boil to scald the 
flour, and be served at once very hot ; they ishould not be 
left for a moment. The quantities required of mustard 
and cayenne entirely depend on the strength of the ma- 
terial furnished, and the cook should be discreet in the 
use of them. The quantity of salt varies with the quan- 
tity of meat turned out from the terrapin. 

Those who prefer the smaller ones get a large one for 
the eggs, as they are considered a delicacy ; but no epicure 
would ever prefer the larger meat. The larger terrapins 
may be boned, and the meat very carefully stewed up. 

There is a red-legged terrapui in the market, the eggs 
of which are very delicate, and by many considered supe- 
rior to the eggs of the diamond back. 

For an invalid, terrapins stewed in cream, with salt and 
pepper, are very nourishing. 

Fried Fillets of Whitings with Truffles. — Cut fillets of 
whitings the same size, fry them in butter, sprinkle with 
fine salt, drain on brown paper, squeeze lemon juice over 
them, slice some truffles in the frying-pan, add a little but- 
ter, and dress them in alternate slices on a dish garnished 
with fried croutons of bread. 

Broiled Whitings. — Prepare your fish ; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper; steep them in olive-oil; when yon are 
ready to serve them place them on the griddle ; let them

cook slowly, turning them ; when done pour over them 
either a white sauce with capers or capucines, or a tomato 
sauce; garnish the dish with slices of lemon or pickles 
cut in slices. 

Sole d la Normandie, — ^Put a lump of fresh butter as 
large as an egg in a dish you can place on the fire ; add 
slices of onions cut very thin, parsley, salt, and pepper; 
lay your fish in this ; pour over half a bottle of the best 
cider, two dozen oysters, one dozen muscles well trimmed, 
shrimps, and slices of truffles ; cook on a gentle fire, bast- 
ing the fish from time to time with the sauce; when it is 
cooked place the fish oti a dish, and pour over the sauce. 

Fi8h Cooked with Maca/roni. — Throw your macaroni 
in boiling water ; when it swells and is nearly done take 
it out, and throw it in cold water and drain well ; cook 
your fish in the same water, take it off the fire, scale it, 
and cut it in slices; remove all the bones; put some but- 
ter and grated cheese in a deep dish, then put in a layer 
of fish, then one of cheese and macaroni, and continue till 
you place four alternate layers ; put it in the stove till it 
cooks ; brown it with a salamander. 

Fried Whitings (Greenwich Receipt). — Scale, wash, and 
draw your fish, leaving in the livers ; cut off the fins and 
tails; make oblique incisions on both sides of the fish; 
sprinkle with flour and throw them in boiling lard ; when 
they are a good color take them out, drain them on brown 
paper, sprinkle them with a little fine salt, and serve on a 
napkin ; garnish your dish with fried parsley. 

Stewed Eockfah. — ^^Rub the fish well with butter to 
keep the skin from breaking ; brown three or four onions 
in slices and spread them on the bottom of the fish-kettle ; 
place the fish upon the onions, with pepper and salt ; pour 
over it about three pints of water, and let it simmer very

slowly ; just before serving add a wineglassful of wine, 
and the same of mushroom catsup. 

Desirie^s Courtbouillon for Fish. — Three green onions 
sliced and fried with three cloves of garlic ; half a bottle of 
claret; one tablespoonful of the finest white flour; half a 
bottle of beef tea ; five whole tomatoes ; some fresh fish, 
cut in slices. 

When the onions and garlic are done put fn the other 
ingredients, tlie fish and tomatoes last of all ; season it to 
taste, and let it simmer until done. 

Salt Fish and Potatoes. — One pound of salt fish ; three 
and a half pounds of potatoes, peeled ; one and a half 
ounces of dripping; one onion, chopped fine; one bunch 
of parsley; white pepper, salt, mustard, and vinegar to 
taste. 

Chop it fine, and put it in the saucepan with a little 
fresh water ; let it come to a boil as slowly as possible ; 
boil and mash the potatoes, and put a layer of potatoes in 
the bottom of a dish, with a little dripping; put in the 
fish and a layer of chopped parsley and onion ; add mus- 
tard, pepper, and vinegar, then another layer of potatoes, 
then another of fish, etc., until the dish is full; cover all 
with potatoes and a little dripping; bake in a quiet oven 
for half an hour. 

Fish au Gratin. — Take a long, flat dish whicli you can 
put on the fire ; put a layer of onions cut in round slices 
in the bottom, and another layer of sliced tomatoes ; enough 
olive-oil to prevent burning; season well with salt and 
pepper (red is preferable) ; clean and scale your fish, stuff 
it with a stuffing made of sausage-meat (without sage or 
spices), chopped oysters, chopped mushrooms, the yolk of 
an egg, bread crumbs, pepper, and salt well mixed togeth- 
er; lay your fish in the baking-dish, put a large lump of 
butter on it, and put it in the oven ; moisten it from time 



FISH. 83 

to time with the sauce ; when nearly done pour over a 
generous supply of white wine, and sprinkle with bread 
crumbs; pour a little of the sauce over the bread crumbs 
before serving ; garnish your dish with sprigs of parsley 
and lemon cut in quarters. 

Mackerd or Pompano should be boiled and served with 
maitre d^Mtd sauce, which is made by mixing chopped 
parsley, salt, and pepper with butter, and adding the juice 
of a lemon. 

Oyster Toast, — Beard the oysters ; chop them up with 
anchovies (removing the bones); pepper and a little salt, 
mix with butter; fry them five minutes; spread the paste 
on slices of toasted bread; pour over the juice which is 
left ; serve hot, for breakfast or lunch. 

Boston Codfish Balls (" Boston Cook-book "). — One cup 
of raw salt fish; one pint of potatoes; one teaspoonful 
of butter; one egg, well beaten; one quarter of a salt- 
spoonful of pepper ; salt, if needed. 

Wash and bone the fish, and pick in half-inch pieces ; 
pare the potatoes, and cut in quarters ; put potatoes and 
fish in the stewpan, and boil twenty-five minutes, or until 
the potatoes are soft, but be careful not to let them boil 
long enough to become soggy; drain off all the water, 
mash and beat the fish and potatoes until very light, add 
the butter and pepper, and when slightly cooled add the 
egg, and more salt if necessary ; shape quickly into cakes, 
slip off into a basket, and fry in smoking hot lard one min- 
ute ; fry only five at a time, as more will cool the fat ; the 
lard should be hot enough to brown a piece of bread while 
you count forty ; drain on soft paper. Tliese balls should 
be mixed while the potatoes and fish are hot. If you wish 
to prepare them the night before, omit the egg, and in the 
morning warm the fish and potatoes in a double boiler, 
and then add tlie egg ; keep the fish in a bowl of cold wa-

ter while picking it apart, and it will need no further 
soaking. 

Kever chop salt fish ; pick apart into small pieces, and 
rnb with a potato masher until it is reduced to fine threads. 

Boston Fish Hash (" Boston Cook-book "). — Prepare as 
above, cook in a little salt-pork fat in a frying-pan until 
brown, and then turn out like an omelet. 

Boston Fish Souffle. — Prepare as above, add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream and two eggs, cream and eggs well 
beaten, and beaten separately ; bake in a buttered dish. 



MEATS. 

BEEF. 

BOASTING MEATS (sOYEe). 

As an invariable rule, all dark meats — such as beef and 
mutton — should be put down before a sharp fire for at 
least fifteen minutes, until the outside has a coating of 
gravy ; then remove it back, and cook it gently. Lamb, 
veal, and pork should be cooked at a moderate tire. Veal 
should be covered with paper. Very rich meat, if covered 
with paper, does not require basting. Eoast meats should 
be dredged with flour just at the time the gravy begins 
to appear. 

TIME-TABLE FOB BOASTING. 

Ten pounds of beef require from two hours to two and 
a half roasting before a good fire, but at eighteen inches 
distant. Six pounds one hour and a quarter to one hour 
and a half, fourteen inches from a good fire. 

Three ribs of beef, boned and rolled, well tied round 
with paper, will take two hours and a half, eighteen inch- 
es from a good fire, and only baste once. 

If beef is very fat it does not require basting ; if very 
lean, tie it up in greasy paper and baste well. 

Eight pounds of veal will take from one hour and a half 
to two hours, eighteen inches from the fire ; if stuffed, at 
least two hours. 

Chump, or loin and kidneys, of four pounds, will take 
one hour and a quarter ; baste well. 

Six pounds of breast one hour, twelve inches from the 
fire. 

Six pounds of shoulder and neck the same. 



86 THE UNRIVALLED CXX)K-BOOK. 

Calf's heart, stuflEed and tied up in paper, three quarters 
of an hour. 

Mutton leg, eight pounds, one hour and a half, eighteen 
inches from the fire. 

Saddle of mutton, ten pounds, one hour and a quarter 
to one hour and a half, eighteen inches from the lire, meas- 
uring from the flat surface. 

Shoulder, one hour and a half. Loin, one hour and a 
half. Breast, three quartere of an hour. 

Lamb, according to size, in the same proportion as mut- 
ton; but it ought always to be well done, and should 
roast at about fifteen inches from the fire. 

Pork should be well done always. It is best to rub it 
well with salt the night previous, and scrape it off before 
roasting. 

In roasting beef, mutton, lamb, pork, and poultry, a 
dripping-pan should be placed under the meat, with a lit- 
tle clear dripping or fat, which should be very hot wlien 
the meat is basted. A quarter of an hour before serving 
add half a pint of water to the fat in the dripping-pan ; 
dredge the meat with flour and salt. When the meat is 
cooked, strain the gravy in the dripping-pan through a 
gauze strainer, remove the fat, add a little coloring, and 
serve. 

Veal and poultry should have half the water put into 
the pan, and that, when strained, added to half a pint of 
thick, melted butter ; color as above directed. 



Boast Beef on the Spit. — The best pieces for roasting 
are the sirloin and rib pieces. It is best to make the 
butcher remove as much bone as possible. Skewer the 
meat into shape and pass it on the spit ; place a dripping- 
pan underneath, and baste the beef at first with butter, 
afterwards with its own drippings. The fire should be 
clear, steady, and not too fierce ; allow a quarter of an 
hour to a pound if you like the beef rare ; serve on a heat- 
ed dish, pouring over it the liquor in the dripping-pan, 



MEATS— BEEF. 87 

and garnish with a wreath of water-cresses or fresh pars- 
ley. Eoast beef should always be accompanied by mus- 
tard and scraped horseradish. There are three different 
ways of preparing this. It may be served dry, or steeped 
in vinegar, or steeped in cream. The latter is most in use 
in Italy, and is very good. 

Baked Beef {or beef roasted in the oven). — Put the beef 
to roast in a deep pan, and before putting it down dash a 
cup of boiling water over it to prevent the escape of the 
juices. If very fat, cover with a paste of flour and water 
until nearly done ; baste frequently — at first with salt and 
water, afterwards with its own drippings ; when almost 
done dredge with a little browned flour, and baste once 
with butter ; allow a quarter of an hour to a pound for 
rare beef, more if you like the beef well done ; serve on a 
very hot dish, and garnish as above. 

Yorkshire Pudding^ No. 1. — One pint of milk ; four 
eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately ; two cups of flour ; 
one teaspoonful of salt. 

This pudding should be mixed three quarters of an hour 
before the beef is done, and poured into the dripping-pan, 
which should contain just fat enough to prevent the pud- 
ding from sticking; it should cook under the meat; when 
both are cooked the pudding should be cut into squares, 
and placed in the same dish with the beef. 

Yorkshire Pudding^ No. 2, — Four tablespoonfuls of 
Hecker's farina ; one pint of milk ; four eggs, whites and 
yolks beaten separately. 

Mix and pour into the dripping-pan as above. Tliis is 
much better than the ordinary Yorkshire pudding. 

Yorkshire Puddvng^ No. 3. — Four tablespoonfuls of 
Hecker's farina; one pint of milk. 
Boil and allow to cool ; when cold and hard put into a 



88 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

dish under the beef; do this just long enough to allow it 
to get thoroughly browned and heated through. This is 
the simplest and best of all. 

Stewed Beefsteak, — Fry a tender steak lightly, with on- 
ions, turnips, and carrots ; tlien stew slowly, as for rump 
of beef. 

Stewed Bump of Beef. — Wash it well, and season high 
with salt, allspice, black and cayenne pepper, three cloves, 
and a blade of mace, all in fine powder ; bind tightly, and lay 
in a pot that will just hold it, with three large onions sliced 
and fried, three carrots, two turnips, a shallot, four cloves, 
a blade of mace, and some celery ; add, also, a handful of 
sweet herbs, regulating the quantity of each according to 
their pungency. The herbs used should be parsley, thyme, 
basil, knotted marjoram, and chives. Cover the beef with 
good beef broth, putting in some bones if you have them ; 
simmer as slowly and gently as possible for several hours, 
until quite tender ; clear off the fat, add to the gravy half 
a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, a tablespoonf ul of 
mushroom catsup, a pinch of burned sugar ; now simmer 
for half an hour longer, and serve in a deep dish ; garnish 
with tiny heaps of different vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, 
beet root, pickles, etc. ; all cut small and arranged in a 
tasteful manner; pour the gravy over the beef and serve. 

Beef CoUops, — Take some beef that is tender and free 
from skin, cut into small, thin pieces, and hack it with a 
knife ; then butter a stewpan, and put in as much beef 
as will cover the pan, with a soup^on of onion, some cu- 
cumber cut small, and salt and pepper ; put it over the 
fire and toss constantly; two or three minutes will do 
them ; add a little browned flour, butter, and water to the 
gravy.

it very thin, aud fry a moment in butter; stew with good 
stock, chopped shallot, aucliovy essence, mushrooms, and 
oysters ; thicken the gravy as above. 

Old Humphrey* B a la mode Beef (in use for nearly two 
centuries in the same family). — A fine round of beef, 
weighing ten or fifteen pounds ; prepare the day before 
cooking as follows : Make a rich stuffing of rolled bread 
crumbs, salt pork chopped fine, two large onions peeled 
and chopped, some ground cloves, half a dessertspoonful 
of allspice,. some salt and pepper, some sweet marjoram 
and other herbs, chopped fine ; mix all thoroughly with 
the hand ; then make perpendicular incisions with a sharp 
knife through the meat. These incisions should be an inch 
wide, and should be filled with the stuffing and strips of 
lean pork half an inch square. Then tie round the edges 
of the beef with a strong cord ; tie as tightly as possible 
so as to leave the beef a perfect round ; cover the top 
of the round with the stuffing, which should lie an inch 
thick on the top ; cover the beef with a large porcelain 
dish cover, and leave it thus all night. In the morning 
put the beef into a baking-kettle, or, if you have not a 
baking-kettle, into a large pot with legs, and put it on the 
stove or range ; after you have laid four pieces of hard 
wood like this ^ to keep the meat from burning, add 
one pint — not more — of water, and then put on your 
meat ; cook it over a slow fire, adding more water as it 
becomes absorbed. The beef should cook six or eight 
hours at least (ten or twelve hours is not too much for 
a piece of beef weighing over fifteen pounds). After 
the beef has cooked tliree hours, put in three large pota- 
toes sliced, and as many turnips and carrots, also sliced; 
two hours before serving throw in a tumblerful of cur- 
rant jelly, which, added to the gravy already in the pot, 
will make a delicious gravy ; when the beef is cooked, re- 
move it to a hot dish, take off the cord, and arrange the 
vegetables round it; strain the liquor left in the pot, add 



90 THE UNBIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

some browned flour, boil up once, and pour over and round 
the d la mode; garnish with slices of lemon and water- 
cress. This beef is also delicious cold. 

Spiced Beef, — Twenty to twenty-five pounds of round of 
beef; half a pound of coarse brown sugar; two ounces of 
saltpetre ; three quarters of a pound of common salt ; a 
quarter of a pound of black pepper ; three ounces of all- 
spice ; four ounces of bruised juniper berries. 

Kub the beef well, in every part, with the coarse brown 
sugar and let it remain two days; then reduce to powder 
all the other ingredients, and blend them thoroughly and 
smoothly together; when this is done rub the ingredients 
strongly and equdHy over the meat, turning it at the same 
time so as not to permit even the tenth part of an inch to 
miss -the rubbing. Repeat this daily for three weeks, al- 
ways turning, of course ; then wash off the spice, and put 
the beef into an earthen pan as nearly of its size as possi- 
ble ; pour into the pan a cupful of good strong stock ; cov- 
er the beef thickly with chopped beef suet, and lay a coarse, 
thick crust over the pan ; then put on the cover and bake 
the meat from five to six hours in a moderate oven, which 
should not, however, be suflSciently fierce to harden the 
meat. If properly managed spiced beef is exceedingly 
tender ; it should be allowed to cool in the pan in which 
it was baked ; when quite cold, remove it from the pan 
and scrape off the suet ; garnish it with crimped parsley 
and water-cresses. It is to be served cold. 

Hunter^ 8 Beef ^ Gloucestershire, — Twenty-five pounds of 
a fine, fat round of beef; take out the bone and rub the 
beef daily for two weeks with the following mixture: 
Three ounces of saltpetre ; one ounce of ground cloves; 
half an ounce of allspice ; one large nutmeg, grated ; one 
quart of salt ; two ounces of brown sugar. 

Mix all the ingredients thoroughly and smoothly to- 
gether and pound them to a fine powder; place a layer of 



MEATS— BEEF. 91 

this powder in the bottom of the tub in which you pat 
the beef, and after the beef has been well rubbed cover it 
with the powder. Be careful to turn the beef daily when 
you rub it, and to rub it hard and evenly. At the end of 
two weeks wasli the beef carefully in vinegar; fill the 
place from which the bone has been taken with fat ; stick 
some cloves in the fat; bind the beef with tape to keep it 
in a compact, round shape, and lay it in a pan which fits it 
exactly; cover it with a thick layer of beef suet, and pour 
over it a pint of fresh water, in which you have mixed a 
wineglassful of port wine ; cover the pan with a thick pa- 
per, buttered, and again with a closely fitting cover; bake 
five hours over a cle&r, steady, but not too fierce, fire ; al- 
low the beef to cool in the pan ; when quite cold uncover 
the pan, take out the beef, unbind it, and scrape oS the 
suet ; serve cold. 

Corned Beef, — Rub the beef well with salt, mixed with 
one tenth part of saltpetre, until the salt lies dry upon the 
surface ; put aside in a cold place for twenty-four hours 
and repeat the process, rubbing in the mixture very thor- 
oughly ; put away until the next day, when the pickle 
should be ready: Five gallons of water; one gallon of 
salt; four ounces of saltpetre; one and a half pounds of 
brown sugar. 

Boil this pickle ten minutes ; when perfecUy coldj ponr 
over the beef, having previously wiped the latter dry ; 
examine the pickle from time to time to see if it keeps 
well; if not, take the meat out at once, wipe it, and 
cover with salt until you can prepare new and stronger 
brine. 

JRusdan Beef Balls. — For these balls equal quantities 
of the best rump steak and fillet are required. The meat 
must be entirely freed from skin and fat, and chopped 
so finely that it can be passed through a sieve ; all the 
blood must be preserved and mixed with the minced 



92 THE UNRIVALLED COOKBOOK. 

meat, which must be very slightly salted. Meanwhile cut 
another fillet into thick strips, and squeeze the juice 
into a saucepan; form the mince into balls, binding it, 
if necessary, with beaten Qgg^ but leaving a hollow in 
the centre of each ball ; the saucepan with the beef juice 
must then be put for a moment or two on the fire, un- 
til the juice thickens, when the saucepan should be re- 
moved from the fire, and the juice poured into the balls, 
^^ e.y in the hollow in the middle ; then close and re- 
form the balls, dip them in beaten white of egg, and 
in bread crumbs; fry them rapidly in heef lard (the 
whole process must be brief) until they are of a deli- 
cate brown color ; then drain in a wire basket, and serve 
in a very hot dish. If properly made and cooked they 
are rare inside, and have the flavor of the best roast 
beef. Plain boiled potatoes, light and floury, should be 
served with them. 

Stewed FiUet of Beef with Haisins. — Take four pounds 
of fillet, wipe clean, and put into a porcelain-lined casse- 
role with two ounces of good butter, and a sufficient quan- 
tity of finely chopped celery, carrots, onions, and ham to 
form a layer over and under the beef. This mince should 
previously have been fried in butter to a light brown. 
Cover the casserole closely, and stew over a slow fire for 
three quarters of an hour ; then remove from the fire for 
a moment, and strain the mince; return the fillet and 
strained sauce to the casserole, adding a teacupful of 
strong beef tea, or stock, and a double handful of the best 
Sultana raisins, seeded ; cover the casserole closely, and 
stew for an hour and a quarter; serve on a hot dish, and 
pour over the fillet the sauce and raisins with which it 
has been cooked. This quantity of fillet is enough for six 
people. 

Stewed FiUet of Beef with Mushrooms, — Take six 
pounds of fillet of beef, wipe clean, and put into a porce- 



M£ATS— BEEF. 93 

Iain-lined saucepan with a mince prepared in the follow- 
ing manner : Take equal quantities of dried mushrooms, 
fresh shallots, celery, and uncooked ham ; chop very fine, 
and fry to a light brown in butter ; put a thick layer of 
this^ mince under und over the fillet, add two and a half 
ounces of butter, and stew over a slow fire for an hour; 
then strain the mince, return the fillet and sauce to the 
fire, adding a large teacupful of strong beef tea or stock, 
a wineglassful of sherry, and a double handful of button 
mushrooms, properly washed, wiped, and scraped ; cover 
the casserole closely, and stew for an hour and a quarter 
longer ; serve on a hot dish, and pour over it the sauce 
and mushrooms with which it has been cooked. 

Beefsteak Broiled, — Cut the steak three quarters of an 
inch thick, wipe carefully with a clean cloth, lay on the 
meat board, and pound with a steak mallet ; wipe again 
carefully, and lay on a buttered gridiron over a clear fire, 
turning it very often when it begins to drip, and with- 
drawing the gridiron from the fire a moment should the 
fat drop on the coals and blaze. The steak ought to cook 
in twelve minutes if the fire be good ; then lay on a very 
hot dish which has previously been rubbed with garlic, 
salt, and pepper on both sides, and lay a liberal lump 
of butter on the upper ; then cover, and let it stand five 
minutes in a hot place to draw out the juices ; dust lightly 
with roasted powdered parsley before sending it to table. 

If the proper sort of gridiron be not attainable, rub 
lightly a clean, hot frying-pan with a rag dipped in butter, 
put in the meat, set over a clear, fierce fire, and turn fre- 
quently. The best pieces for steak are the porter-house, 
sirloin, and rump. In some respects the rump steaks are 
the best of all. 

Beefsteak and Onions, — Prepare the steak as above di- 
rected ; while broiling, put three or four chopped onions 
in the frying-pan with a little beef dripping or butter ; 



94 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

stir them quickly until they are delicately browned ; when 
the steak is dished cover it with the onions, then cover 
the dish and let it stand eight minutes. 

Beefsteak Pie, — Cut the, steak into pieces an inch long, 
and stew, with the bone, in enough water to cover it until 
the meat is half done ; in another pot parboil twelve good 
potatoes. Take a deep pudding dish, and put in a layer 
of the beef with salt, pepper, and a little chopped onion, 
then one of sliced potatoes, with little bits of butter dot- 
ted over them ; proceed in this manner until the dish is 
full ; pour over all the gravy in which the meat has stewed, 
having first thrown away the bone and thickened with 
browned flour ; cover with a thick crust, leaving a slit in 
the middle ; brush with beaten white of egg and bake. 

Crust for Meat Pies. — One quart of fine white fiour, 
sifted ; three tablespoonf uls of lard ; two and a half cups 
of milk ; one teaspoonf ul of soda wet with hot water, and 
stirred into the milk ; two teaspoonf uls of cream of tartar, 
sifted into the dry flour; one teaspoonful of salt. 

Work up very lightly and quickly, and do not let it get 
too stifiE. 

Beef Pie, Potato Crust. — Mince some cold roast or 
corned beef, season, and spread a layer in the bottom of a 
deep pudding dish ; then a layer of mashed potato stuck 
over with bits of butter, then meat again, and so on until 
the disli is full ; pour over all a gravy made of dripping, 
milk, butter, and a little tomato catsup, and cover all with 
a thick crust made as follows : One large cupful of mashed 
potato ; two tablespoonf uls of melted butter ; a well-beaten 
egg ; two cups of milk. 

Beat all together until very light, and add enough flour 
to enable you to roll it out ; cover the pudding dish with 
this crust, cutting a slit in the middle ; brush over with 
beaten white of egg and bake. 



MEATS-BEEF. 95 

Beef Hash. — Two parts of cold roast beef, freed from 
fat and chopped fine ; one part of cold potatoes, chopped 
fine ; a little pepper, salt, milk, and melted butter. 

Turn into a frying-pan and stir until it is heated through, 
but not brown ; put into a deep dish and form into a hil> 
lock. 

Or, cease stirring for a few minutes, and let a brown 
crust form ; then serve in a round dish, with the crust up- 
permost. 

The hash may also be served on small squares of toast. 

Corned Beef Hash is made in precisely the same way, 
never allowing, however, a crust to form; serve with 
poached eggs on top. 

RoUed Beef — ^Take some lean, raw beef, free from fat 
and skin, and pound in a mortar until you can pass it 
through a sieve; mix with it half the quantity of stale 
bread crumb moistened with water to a paste, also some 
fat pork cut into small dice; season with a chopped shal- 
lot, a little grated lemon peel, the tiniest pinch of sugar, 
and salt and pepper to taste ; bind with beaten egg and 
roll in bread crumbs; then envelop it in cabbage leaves, 
bind it with string into a firm roll, and bake. It should 
be eaten cold. 

Irish Stew, — Put some slices of lean beef in a stewpan, 
with a good deal of water, or, better still, thin stock, two 
large onions thinly sliced, a stick of celery chopped fine, 
some cold boiled potatoes (whole), and a little salt and 
pepper ; stew gently until the potatoes are quite soft and 
have taken up nearly all the gravy.^ 

Tomato and Beef Stew. — Put some large trophy toma- 
toes — peeled, cored, and sliced thinly — into a stewpan with 
some raw beef, prepared in the following manner : Take 
some lean beef — rump steak is best — free from skin and 



96 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

fat, and pound it so finely that it can be passed through a 
sieve; spread each slice of tomato nearly an inch thick 
with this, salting it very slightly ; then put another layer 
of tomatoes and beef, and so on until the stewpan is near- 
ly full; pour in all the blood from the steak, and enough 
stock to moisten all ; sprinkle the top layer with browned 
bread crumbs, also moistened slightly with stock; stick 
bits of fresh butter over this layer, and, covering the stew- 
pan, let all stew together slowly until it becomes very soft ; 
then stir thoroughly, add a tablespoonful of white sugar, 
and serve in a very hot dish, rubbed with garlic. 

Breakfast Stew of Beef (" Common-Sense in the House- 
hold "). — Cut up two pounds of beef — not too lean — ^into 
pieces an inch long; put tliem into a saucepan with just 
enough water to cover them, and stew gently for two 
hours; set away until next morning, when season with 
pepper, salt, sweet marjoram or summer savory, chopped 
onion, and parsley ; stew half an hour longer, and add a 
teaspoonful of sauce or catsup, and a tablespoonful of 
browned flour moistened with cold water; finally, half a glass 
of wine ; boil up once, and pour into a covered deep dish. 

Beef ^8 Heart. — Wash the heart well, and cut into squares 
half an inch long; stew them for ten minutes in enough 
water to cover them ; salt the water slightly, and skim the 
scum as it rises; take out the meat, strain the liquor, and 
return the chopped heart to it, with a sliced onion, a large 
spoonful of tomato catsup, some parsley, a head of celery 
chopped fine, and cayenne pepper, with a large lump of 
butter; stew until the meat is very tender, thicken with a 
tablespoonful of browned flour, boil up once, and serve. 

Dried Smoked Beef and Eggs. — Shave the beef into 
thin strips, and put into a pan with enougli boiling water 
to cover them; set them over the fire for ten minutes, 
then drain oflE tlie water and cut the beef into very small 



MEATS— BBEF. 97 

pieces ; have ready some well-beaten eggs, allowing four 
to half a pound of beef ; stir them into a pan with the 
minced meat, and toss and stir the mixture about for two 
minutes ; send to table in a covered dish. 

Orated Beef , — Cut a thick lump of smoked beef and 
dry it in the oven until perfectly hard ; then grate to fine 
powder, and serve with thin slices of bread-and-b utter, or 
with hot buttered wafers. 

Beef Jbw^w^.— Wash thoroughly, and soak over-night 
in cold water. The next morning put it into a pot with 
plenty of cold water, and boil slowly until — on testing it 
with a fork — ^you find it tender throughout ; when cold 
pare off the thick skin, garnish with parsley, and cut in 
slices. 

Or, you can serve it hot with a dolce forte sauce. 

Tongue is very good in the latter way. 

Peraellade of BouiUi. — Put some drippings of roast 
meat, or some butter, in a silver or earthen dish that you 
can put on the fire; chop some mushrooms and parsley 
very fine and put a layer in the bottom of your dish ; cov- 
er this with 21 layer of dried bread crumbs, and lay in your 
slices of bouilli ; repeat this till you use all the bouilli ; 
moisten it well with bouillon, and from time to time add 
more bouillon ; season with salt and pepper ; let it simmer 
three quarters of an hour, skim off the grease, and serve 
with a garnish of small potatoes fried in butter. 

BouiUi en Quenelles. — Chop your bouilli very fine, witli 
some roasted Irish potatoes; add some butter, salt, and 
pepper ; bind it with some beaten eggs ; knead it all well 
together, make it into little balls which you fry in butter, 
and serve with a saxice piquante. 

BooT'MarCa Stew. — Slice your soup meat and put it on

08 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

a platter ; sprinkle with salt and pepper, chopped parsley, 
and chives, and a clove of garlic mashed fine ; add a little 
lard, a glass of stock, and a few bread crumbs ; let it sim- 
mer on the hot ashes till done, and serve. 

Bib Piece with Mushrooms. — Take ont the bones, trim 
away any superfluous fat and tendons; put your entrecdte 
(rib piece) in a saucepan with a piece of butter as large a^ 
an egg ; let it cook on both sides, and take it out ; put in the 
same saucepan a spoonful of flour ; let it brown ; moisten 
with warm water ; add a glassful of brandy, salt and pepper; 
put your entrecdte back' in the saucepan ; cook it three or 
four hours, add some mushrooms, and finish cooking; five 
minutes before serving add some olives which you have 
stoned. 

Fricasseed Tripe, — Cut it into little squares ; put some 
butter in a saucepan with a spoonful of flour; add a 
glassful of bouillon ; cook your tripe in this ten minutes ; 
stir in (taking the saucepan off the fire) the yolks of two 
eggs, a little butter, salt, and pepper, and a little lemon 
juice. 

Fried Tripe, — Cut the tripe in strips two inches long; 
dip them in melted butter seasoned with salt and pepper, 
then into pounded bread crumbs, fry them a golden brown, 
and arrange them in a crown on a dish with sauce Tartar, 
or sauce Robert. 

BouiUi. — This is soup meat. You take it out of your 
soup-pot and serve as an entree. You can serve it with 
any sauce. Tomato is excellent, or sauce piquante made 
of chopped pickles,.mustard, and oil. 

Beef Tongue (Guillaum^'s receipt). — Scald a beefs 
tongue and take off the outer skin ; boil the tongue in salt- 
ed water till done ; drain well, and when thoroughly cold 



MEATS— BEEF. 99 

cut it in slices^ dress it on a disk, and cover with a mayon- 
naise sauce. This, when well dressed, cannot be distin- 
guished from fish. 

Beef Tongue^ Sauce PiqiMnte. — Scald a beefs tongue, 
and take off the outer skin ; boil the tongue in salted wa- 
ter ; split it lengthwise, and pour over it a sauce ^t^t^an^. 

Tongue Smothered in Mushrooms, — Blanch your tongue 
in boiling water, skin it, and trim it ; lard it with strips of 
bacon ; put in a saucepan slices of salted fat pork with the 
skin on it, pepper, parsley, thyme, a laurel leaf, a clove, on- 
ions, and carrots ; place your tongue on this, add a glassful 
of white wine, or half a glassful of brandy, and cover your 
tongue well with bouillon ; cook slowly three hours ; cov- 
er your saucepan with a buttered paper and keep the sauce- 
pan lid on all the time, to prevent evaporation ; take your 
tongue out of the saucepan, put it on a dish, and slice it 
lengthwise, without cutting the slices apart; skim your 
sauce, thicken it with a little rou/X^ and add chopped escha- 
lottes, mushrooms, chopped pickles, pepper, and a little 
bouillon; boil five minutes, and serve poured over the 
tongue. A tomato sauce may also be served with the 
tongue if preferred. 

Slices of cold tongue dipped in egg and bread crumbs and 
fried can also be served with a mushroom or tomato sauce. 

Beef d la Mode. — Take a round of beef, lard it well, 
put it in a saucepan with some slices of bacon skin, half a 
calf's foot, an onion, a carrot, a soup bunch, laurel leaf, 
thyme, garlic, cloves, salt, and pepper ; pour over a pint of 
water, half a glassful of white wine or a spoonful of bran- 
dy, and cook until the meat becomes tender ; dress your 
beef on a dish ; skim the gravy, adding bouillon if neces- 
sary, let it boil up, strain it, and pour over the beef. It 
requires six hours to cook over a slow fire, and the sauce- 
pan should be kept closely covered. 



100 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Tenderloin d la Broche. — Trim and lard your fillet; 
steep it twelve hours in a marinade of olive-oil, pepper, 
salt, parsley, laurel leaf, and slices of onion ; put it on the 
spit, the larded side covered with buttered paper ; let it 
cook before a quick fire ; remove the paper a few moments 
before serving; take it off the spit quite rare; serve it 
with a sauce made of the drippings, a dash of lemon, 
chopped eschalottes, salt, and pepper. 

Tenderloin Stedka^ Sautis aux Champignons. — Cut your 
steaks all the same size ; season with salt and pepper ; broil 
them on a gridiron over a quick fire, turning them that 
they may be a good color on both sides ; when done place 
them on a dish and keep warm ; melt a piece of butter in 
a saucepan ; add your mushrooms cut verj^ thin, a little 
stock (a tablespoonf ul) ; season to taste ; add a glassful of 
white wine ; let it boil up once, skim, and serve poured 
over the steaks. 

Turnovers. — Take slices of cold tenderloin ; heat them 
in hot gravy or bouillon ; cut slices of bread the size of 
the slices of tenderloin ; fry them in butter, arrange them 
on a dish — alternately a slice of fillet and a slice of bread 
— and pour over them a ^^luqq piquante. 

Birds witJwut Bones d la Bertini. — Take thin slices of 
tenderloin beef; spread over them thin slices of boiled 
ham exactly the same size; put in each one a ripe olive 
and a sage leaf; wrap them up and tie them tightly in 
little rolls ; cook them in olive-oil in a saucepan ; remove 
the threads and serve. 

Stewed Beef Feet for Breakfast.— Chsm your beefs 
feet ; scrape well, and scald and remove the hoofs ; boil 
them in water until they are tender. You can ascertain 
this by sticking them with a sharp knife. Drain them, 
and remove the large bones; put a lump of butter in a 



MEATS— BEEF. 101 

saucepan with the feet, pour in a cupful of rich, sweet 
cream, season with salt and pepper, cook slowly until you 
can run a straw through them, and serve. 

Sirloin d la Oodard. — Eemove the bones from the sir- 
loin, trim away the gristle, and any tendons-you can reach ; 
lard it well with, salted fat pork ; make it into a round ; 
skewer it carefully to keep it in shape ; put it in a sauce- 
pan with carrots, a bunch of fine herbs, onions, salt, and 
pepper ; cover it with good bouillon, and put in it a glass- 
ful of Madeira ; cook it on a slow fire ; when the beef is 
done skim the gravy and strain it ; return it to the sauce- 
pan with some meat juice, sliced sweetbreads, artichokes, 
and mushrooms; pour this sauce over your sirloin and 
serve. 

The Best Way to Heat Cold Meats. — Cover them with 
buttered paper; put them on the spit until they warm 
through. They will be as tender as the first day. If the 
cold meats are in small pieces, cover them with buttered 
paper, and broil them on the gridiron ; sprinkle them with 
finely chopped herbs. 

Rib Piece d la MarseiUaise. — Eemove the bones from 
the rib piece ; cook it in a saucepan with some slices of 
bacon ; set it aside ; make a roicos in the saucepan ; put 
back your rib piece and slices of bacon ; add spices, salt, 
onions, carrots, soup bunch, and a glassful of brandy ; cook 
it five hours over a slow fire, skim it, and serve. A great 
many pieces of beef, veal, mutton, and even pork, can be 
served in this manner. 

Tripe, Sow to Prepare i^.— Scrape your tripe ; clean 
it carefully ; wash it through several waters (boiling), then 
in cold water; cook six hours in water with slices of on- 
ion, cloves, salt, and a few spoonfuls of flour. 



VEAL. 

Boost Lorn of Veal. — Allow a quarter of an hour to a 
pound ; heat gradually, and baste frequently — at first with 
salt and water, afterwards with its own gravy ; when near- 
ly done dredge lightly with flour, and baste once with 
melted butter. Should the meat brown too fast, cover 
with white paper buttered ; skim the gravy, thicken with 
a spoonful of browned flour, boil up once, and serve. 

Veal Chops. — Trim as for mutton-chops, dip in beaten 
^ggj and roll in bread crumb, and fry. 

Veal Steak. — This should be thinner than beefsteak, and 
thoroughly cooked. Rare veal is an abomination. Broil 
on a buttered gridiron over a clear fire, turning frequently 
until thoroughly cooked ; serve with tomato sauce poured 
over the steak, made as follows: A teacupful of tomato 
stewed and strained; five small button onions, chopped 
fine; a little thyme and parsley ; a piece of butter the size 
of an Qgg ; a pinch of sugar, and salt to taste. 

Heat all in a saucepan, and thicken with a spoonful of 
browned flour. 

Veal Sausage d la Baviire (Frau von P. zu P.). — Take 
a good piece of veal, extract the bone, and pound it with 
a mallet ; put both veal and bone into a casserole, together 
with a calf s foot, and sprinkle both with salt and white 
pepper ; put in, also, some chopped onions, carrots, celery, 
and parsley; also some sweet marjoram, thyme, grated 
rind of lemon, a lanrel leaf, and several slices of bacon. 



MEATS— VEAL. 103 

It is better to put the vegetables, herbs, and bacon into the 
casserole first, and then the meat and calf's foot. When 
all the ingredients are in the casserole ponr in a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and about five ounces of melted 
butter; cover the casserole with buttered paper, put on 
the cover, and steam slowly, until the contents are a soft 
mass; then strain off the liquor, remove the bone and 
calf s foot, and put the meat into a mortar ; pound and 
chop it, moistening from time to time with the liquor ; 
then work it all into a fine, smooth mass, and form it into 
a thick sausage roll ; brush it over with melted butter, and 
set it on a wet board, in a cool place, to harden ; serve 
French mustard with it. This receipt is also nice for 
venison. 

Veal and Sam Pie. — Butter a large bowl very thickly, 
and line with sliced and buttered hard-boiled eggs ; then 
put in alternate layers of the thinnest possible slices of 
veal and ham, each completely freed from fat, peppered, 
and sprinkled with lemon juice ; proceed in this way until 
the dish is packed to the brim, remembering always to pack 
very tightly ; when full cover all with a thick paste made 
of flour and hot water, just stiff enough to handle with 
ease ; let it overlap the rim by about an incli ; set the bowl 
in a pot of hot water, taking care that the water does not 
come up to the paste rim ; boil steadily, but not hard, for 
three hours ; then set away in a cool place for twenty-four 
hours ; then remove the paste, turn the pie out of the bowl, 
and when you serve cut in thin slices. 

Minced Veal (Old Humphrey). — Take any cold roast 
veal ; remove the skin, fat, and bones ; put the bones, skin, 
and gristly pieces into a saucepan with a cup of cold milk, 
or, better still, of veal or chicken stock, a little ham, a small

of sweet herbs ; stew all together for an hour, then strain,

minutes longer, stirring in a tablespoonful of butter, and 
another of roasted, powdered parsley. Meanwhile mince 
the cold veal, and put into the gravy a little at a time; 
adding, also, a little grated rind of lemon ; when almost at 
boiling-point stir in two tablespoon fuls of cream, and, last 
of all, a little lemon juice ; heap on a hot dish, and sur- 
round with slices of lemon. 

Scalloped Veal. — ^Bntter a deep dish, and fill with alter- 
nate layers of finely minced veal and rolled bread crumbs, 
dotting the bread crumbs with bits of butter ; season with 
pepper and salt, and moisten with cream or milk ; last of 
all pour in a cupful of veal broth, and cover with a thick 
layer of rolled bread crumbs, dotting it heavily with bits 
of butter ; bake half an hour if the dish be small. It should 
be covered at firat, and the cover removed only just long 
enough to allow it to brown. 

TomatiUe. — Cut your veal in thin slices, and about four 
inches square ; make a rich forcemeat stuffing by chopping 
up very fine a little fat pork, eschalottes, bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper — bind with the yolk of an egg; put a 
spoonful of this stuffing on each slice of veal, make it in 
little balls, and stew them in a rich brown gravy made as 
follows: Make a roicx, add some finely chopped onions, a 
little stock, season to taste; cook gently, and keep the 
saucepan closely covered. 

Veal JBoullets. — Take any cold veal you have left ; chop 
it up finely ; add lean ham well chopped, a little fat pork, 
chopped onions, parsley, salt, and pepper; bind it with the 
yolk of an egg beaten up with a little flonr ; make it into 
flat cakes and fry ; servo with any sauce — mayonnaise is 
excellent.

them in boiling water. nntil the larding needle can pass 
through them without tearing them ; cut them in dice ; cut 
the same quantity of mushrooms, also, in dice ; stew them 
together in a little white sauce ; make them into shapes like 
a pear, sticking a clove in the end ; powder them with 
bread crumbs and fry ; serve with a tomato sauce. 

Blanquette of Veal, — Put a lump of butter in a sauce- 
pan ; when it is melted stir in a good spoonful of flour — 
do not let it color ; pour in by degrees two glasses of boil- 
ing water, stirring all the time ; add a little chopped on- 
ion, parsley, salt, and pepper ; cut up in small pieces one 
and a half pounds of veal, and cook it in this sauce. It 
will require three hours over a slow fire. If you make 
your ilanqtceUe of cold meats you need only cook it long 
enough to warm it through. To vary it you can stir in 
the yolks of two eggs after you remove the saucepan from 
the fire. 

Vectl Galantine. — ^Bone a good shoulder of veal ; trim 
it into a good shape ; make a stuffing of some tender meat 
— either veal, fowls, or game, raw or cooked, taking out all 
tendons or bones ; chop it up with twice the quantity of 
kidney fat of veal or beef, removing all the membranes 
which cover it, and mix it well ; adding salt, pepper, nut- 
m^, a little parsley and chives, a pinch of bay leaf and 
thyme powdered ; pound all this well in a wooden or mar- 
ble mortar; add, by degrees, in pounding, two eggs beaten 
up — the white of the egg gives consistency to the paste ; 
mix it till it becomes a smooth paste ; spread out the shoul- 
der of veal ; season with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg ; 
then put a layer of the stuffing, then a layer of strips of 
veal, ham, and bacon, and slices of truffles ; roll it all up 
and tie it tightly; cover it with a cloth and tie it up; 
line a deep saucepan with strips of bacon and bacon skin, 
carrots, onions, soup bunch, and cloves; put in the galan- 
tine with all the trimmings of the shoulder of veal ; sea-

son with a little salt^ add a little bouillon and a pint 
of white wine; cook it slowly three hours; drain your 
galantine, and do not remove the cloth or untie it until 
it is cold. 

To make the jelly, heat your gravy and skim it ; beat up 
tlie whites of two eggs in a saucepan ; pour in by degrees 
your gravy, beating all the time till the moment it begins 
to boil ; set it back on the stove, cover it, and put hot coals 
on the cover ; let it simmer very slightly ; when the whites 
are nearly cooked add the juice of a lemon, which will 
clarify it ; stretch a napkin over the four feet of a stool 
turned upside down, put a dish underneath, and strain 
your jelly gently through ; when it is cold, cut it up and 
decorate your dish with it. You can clarify any gravy or 
consomme in this manner, and it will bo perfectly trans- 
parent. 

Fricandeau of Veal, — Lard a round of veal very fine 
and close on the upper side ; line the bottom of a saucepan 
with slices of bacon, carrots, onions, two cloves, and a soup 
bunch ; put your veal in the saucepan and pour over some 
bouillon. Be careful to baste it from time to time with 
its own sauce. When the fricandeau is done (it will take 
from two to three hours to cook) take it out of the sauce- 
pan, skim your sauce, remove the soup bunch, reduce the 
sauce, and when it becomes thick and brown pour it over 
your fricandeau ; serve it on 2^ puree of sorrel, spinach, to- 
matoes, or celery. 

Veal Cooked in its Own Juice. — Lard a round of veal, 
put it in a saucepan with a good lump of butter, and let it 
take a good color ; add salt, pepper, and a bay leaf ; cook 
it over a slow fire two or three hours; skim the gravy, 
pour a little water in the saucepan, mix it well with the 
gravy, and serve. 

Ragout of Veal, — Cut the breast of veal in pieces three

inches square, fry them a h'ght brown in butter, and take 
them out of the saucepan ; make a roux in the same sauce- 
pan with two spoonfuls of flour; pour in two glasses of 
water or bouillon ; put back the veal ; add a carrot, an on- 
ion stuck with cloves, a soup bunch, salt, and pepper, a 
pinch of sugar, some little onions fried beforehand in but- 
ter, and some mushrooms ; when it is all well cooked re- 
move the soup bunch, skim, and serve. 

Hound of Veal with Anchovies. — Take the bone out of 
a round of veal ; flatten it and lard it with anchovies; salt 
(very little) and pepper ; pour a glassful of vinegar over 
it and let it steep eight hours ; wipe it dry ; sprinkle it 
with a little flour, and put it in a frying-pan with a little 
olive-oil ; cook it over a slow fire, and let both sides brown 
nicely ; when it is done serve it on a dish, add a little 
stock to your sauce, season with salt and pepper, add the 
juice of a lemon, stir it well, and pour over your veal ; 
serve hot. 

Boast Veal with Fine Herbs, — Lard a loin well with 
lard, seasoned with salt, pepper, and fine lierbs ; isteep it 
in a dish three houi*8, with sliced onions, chopped pars- 
ley, mushrooms, a bay leaf, thyme, eschalottes, pepper, 
salt, and olive-oil ; when it is well seasoned, put it on the 
spit, pour over it all the seasoning, and envelop it in two 
buttered sheets of white paper, and let it cook before a 
slow fire ; when it is done remove the paper, and take off 
with the point of a knife all the little herbs that adhere to 
the meat and paper ; put them in the saucepan with the 
gravy, a dash of vinegar, a piece of butter in which a lit- 
tle fiour has been kneaded, a little salt and pepper ; mix 
all well together, and serve with the roast. 

Veal OriUade d la Creole^ No. 1. — Cut slices of tender 
young veal ; put in a saucepan a spoonful of lard, in which 
you slice and fry two onions, half a dozen fine, large, ripe

tomatoes, salt, and pepper (red pepper) ; then put the sliceis 
of* veal in the saucepan and let it cook, adding a little 
sprinkle of flour for thickening ; serve it hot with hominy, 
made of grits^ for breakfast. If you need more sauce, add 
more tomatoes, or a little water. 

Vecd GriUade^ No. 2. — Take slices of either veal, beef, 
mutton, or pork; cut them in slices of equal length and 
thickness; steep them in a little oil, pepper, parsley, onions, 
and salt, all minced together, and let them half cook in 
the saucepan ; take little paper boxes, well greased with 
oil, put the grillade in them with all the seasoning, and 
grate over them some bread crumbs ; cover them with a 
sheet of paper, and cook them slowly on a gridiron ; when 
the sauce is made put in a little vinegar, and pour this 
over the grillade, which you servei in the paper boxes. 

Veal CuUeis en PapiUotes. — Make a stufBng of bread 
crumbs, chopped onions, pieces of fat pork chopped very 
fine, mushrooms, eschalottes, salt, and pepper ; choose fine 
cutlets ; shape them nicely ; spread a layer of this stuffing 
on both sides of your cutlets ; cover each side with a thin 
slice of bacon ; envelop it carefully in a buttered paper 
in the form of a large heart ; cook three quarters of an 
hour on a gridiron, over a slow fire, and serve it in the 
paper. 

P6ie of Calf ^8 Liver, — Three pounds of liver; half a 
pound of round of veal ; half a pound of fillet of beef ; 
half a pound of fresh pork ; quarter of a pound of fat salt 
pork ; half a pound of sausage meat ; a lump of beef mar- 
row as large as a walnut; an onion; a clove of garlic; 
parsley; eschalottes; chevril; two cloves; a little nutmeg; 
salt and pepper. 

Pound the liver, and chop the veal, beef, and pork very 
fine ; put this in a mould ; cook it two hours in an oven 
or in the stove ; serve cold and grated. 



MEATS— VEAL. 109 

Borddaise CuUets, — Shape your cutlets nicely ; season 
with salt and pepper and a dash of nutmeg ; make a stuff- 
ing of fat meat and veal chopped very fine, bread crumbs, 
chopped eschalottes, and parsley ; bind with the yolk of 
an egg, and season with salt and pepper ; spread this over 
each cutlet ; brush them over with beaten egg, and sprin- 
kle with bread cnirabs ; put thera in a baking-dish well 
buttered, with fire above and below; when done arrange 
them on a dish ; pour a little bouillon and a dash of vine- 
gar in the baking-dish to make a gravy, which you pour 
over the chops. 

Ragout of Kidneys, — Slice the kidneys, and remove the 
little hard pieces in the middle ; put a lump of butter in a 
saucepan and ixj your kidneys two minutes, season with 
salt and pepper, sprinkle in a little flour, add a few sliced 
mushrooms, and pour in some white or red wine and a lit- 
tle bouillon ; cook your sauce till it thickens, and pour it 
over the kidneys. 

Liver Stewed. — Slice the liver and lay in salt and water 
for an hour; then cut into dice and put on the fire with 
enough cold water to cover it well ; cover and stew for an 
hour ; when done add a little salt, pepper, mace, sweet mar- 
joram, parsley, and a teaspoonf ul of Worcestershire sauce ; 
stew again for half an hour longer ; then add a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, two of browned flour wet with cold water, 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one of currant jelly ; 
boil five minutes and dish. A little sherry is an improve- 
inent. 

Fried Lwer. — Slice very thinly and lay in salt and wa- 
ter for half an hour ; then wipe dry, flour well, and arrange 
in a frying-pan with a little butter ; when almost cooked 
udd a little salt, pepper, powdered parsley, and three table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice ; when well browned take them 
from the fire and serve in hot dish. 



110 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Stewed Liver (Florentine fashion). — Chop very finely 
some shallots, carrots, a little celery, parsley, and a few 
truffles or dried mashrooms, half a laurel leaf, a little 
thyme, and basil ; add some salt, pepper, and a pinch of 
nutmeg ; cut tlie liver into thin slices and then into small 
squares ; put a layer of liver in the bottom of a casserole 
with a little butter ; cover this with a layer of the chopped 
vegetables, then put another layer of liver, and so on until 
the casserole is quite full ; cover closely and cook slowly, 
with fire below and above, for an hour ; serve the liver in 
a hot dish with the vegetables arranged round it; pour 
over all a piquant sauce. 

Calf ^8 Liver Boasted (" Common-Sense in the House- 
hold "). — Soak the liver in salt and water an hour to draw 
out the blood ; wipe diy, and stuflE with forcemeat made 
of bread crumbs, two slices of fat salt pork chopped small, 
a shallot, pepper, salt, and nutmeg, sweet marjoram and 
thyme, and, if you choose, a little sage ; moisten this with 
butter melted in a very little hot water, and two raw eggs 
well beaten. In order to get this into the liver, make an 
incision with a narrow, sharp knife, and move the point 
dexterously to and fro to enlarge the cavitj- ; stufl^ this full 
of forcemeat and sew up the orifice, lard with strips of 
salt pork, and baste with butter and water at first, after- 
wards with the gravy in the dripping-pan ; roast for an 
hour; pour the gravy over the liver when done. 

Koasted liver is very good cold, cut in slices like tongue. 

Imitation P&tka de Foie Gras of Liver. — Boil a calf s 
liver in water that has been slightly salted, and in another 
vessel a nice calf's tongue. It is best to do this the day 
before the^d^ are made, as they should be not only cold, 
but firm, when used. Cut the liver into bits, and rub them 
gradually to a smooth paste in a Wedgewood mortar, mois- 
tening, as you go on, with melted butter; work into this 
paste, which should be quite soft, a quarter teaspoonful of 



MK ATS— VEAL. Ill 

cayenne pepper, or twice the quantity of white or black, 
half a grated nutmeg, a little cloves, a teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, salt to taste, a full teaspoonful of 
made mustard, and a tablespoonful of boiling water, in 
which an onion has been steeped until the flavor is ex- 
tracted ; work all together thoroughly, and pack in jelly- 
jare with air-tight covers, or, if you have them, in pdU 
jars ; butter the inside of the jara well, and pack tlie pdU 
very hard, inserting here and there square and triangular 
bits of the tongue, which should be pared and cut up for 
this purpose. These simulate the truffles imbedded in the 
genuine pates from Strasburg and elsewhere. When the 
jar is packed and smooth as marble on the surface, cover 
with melted butter; let this harden, put on the lid, and 
set away in a cool place. In winter it will keep for weeks, 
and is very nice for luncheon or tea. Make into sand- 
wiches, or set on in the jars if they are nice and orna- 
mental. These pdiea are really very good, and resemble 
in taste the real pdte defoie gra&. Pigs' livers make a very 
iBxrpdU. The livers of several fowls, however, treated as 
above, make even more satisfactory^^ than the above, 
particularly if you can get real truffles. 

Calf ^8 Head Siewed. — Scald the head in boiling water 
in which a little lye has been dissolved. When the hair 
has been completely removed, scald again carefully ; then 
wash the head in several waters, take out the brains, and 
set them by in a cool place ; tie the head in a floured cloth, 
and boil two hours in hot water slightly salted ; wash the 
brains carefully, picking out all the bits of skin and mem- 
brane, and cleansing them until perfectly white; then 
stew in just enough water to cover them ; boil the head 
until the meat slips easily from the bones ; then cut the 
meat into small even squares, and stew in the water in 
which the head was boiled, adding, also, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a pinch of sugar, a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, and a glassful of Madeira, and thickening with a tea- 



112 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

dpoonf ul of brown flour moistened with cold water ; make 
small croquettes of the brains, which should be poached, 
not fried ; serve in the dish with the stew, arranging the 
croquettes round the stew in the centre. 

Calves^ Brains in Shells. — In using calves' brains be 
caref al always to have them fresh. This being secured, 
boil two calves' brains, cut them into small pieces, put 
them into an earthen saucepan, and season them with pep- 
per and salt ; put into a casserole several tablespoonfuls of 
bechamel sauce, strained ; mix with it, little by little, sev- 
eral tablespoonf als of stock ; when it is smooth and creamy 
add four teaspoonfuls of fine herbs, roasted and crumbled 
to powder ; two minutes after add the brains, mashing and 
stirring well so that they are smootlily mixed with the 
cream ; fill some shells with this mixture, dust with grated 
bread crumbs, put into the oven long enough to brown, 
and serve at once. 

Cromesquis of Caloe^ Brains. — Pour into a casserole a 
glassful of good, strong brown sauce, made according to any 
of the foregoing receipts; mix with it, little by little, four 
tablespoonfuls of melted stock (beef) and a wineglassful 
of Madeira ; when it is thick and smooth withdraw from 
the fire and add two calves' brains, boiled and cut into 
dice as above ; add, also, half the quantity of boiled mush- 
rooms and as much red tongue, cut into small squares ; mix 
all together, season to taste with salt and a soupqon of mus- 
tard, and set away to cool ; when cold form into small rolls, 
envelop each in a paste made of flour and water, rolled 
thin ; dip the cromesquis firet into beaten Qgg^ then in 
rolled bread crumbs, and fry quickly ; drain, and serve 
on a folded napkin. 

Boast Sweetbreads, — Clean and skin four sweetbreads ; 
then heat them almost to boiling; remove from the cas- 
serole, drain, wipe dry, and lard them ; put them into a deep 



MEATS— VEAL. 1|3 

dish and pour over them a little melted butter, then cover 
them carefully with a chopped onion and a little thyme 
and laurel ; cover the dish and let them soak for an hour ; 
then remove the vegetables, envelop each of the sweet- 
breads in white, buttered paper, put them on the spit, or 
on a skewer, and roast before a clear fire for half an honr ; 
remove the paper, baste them with their own drippings 
until brown, then glaze with a salamander, and serve on a 
very hot dish, surrounded with freshly boiled and tender 
green pease. 

Fried Stjoeetbreada. — Blanch three or four moderately 
large sweetbreads, drain, and allow them to cool ; remove 
all strings and skin, and cut into slices half an inch thick ; 
season with salt and pepper and dust with flour; beat two 
eggs very light, yolks and whites together ; add two tea- 
spoonfuls of fine herbs roasted and powdered; dip the 
slices of sweetbread in this, roll in bread crumbs, and fry 
quickly in butter or drippings ; drain on soft paper, ar- 
range on a folded napkin, and serve with a little fried 
parsley. 

Stewed SweeSyreada. — Wash carefully and remove all 
fibrous and fatty matter, and as much skin as possible; 
then put into a saucepan, cover with cold water, and heat 
to a boil ; pour off the hot water, and cover with cold un- 
til the sweetbreads are firm ; when firm stew in a very 
little water, and when tender add for each sweetbread a 
heaping teaspoonful of butter, a little chopped parsley, 
pepper and salt to taste, and some rich cream ; let them 
simmer for five minutes, and serve in the sauce in which 
they have been stewed. 

Or, you may lard the sweetbreads and make a brown 
gravy, substituting for the cream a glassful of good wine. 
In this case do not cook the sweetbreads in the sauce. 
Let it boil up once and pour over them. 



114 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Sfnoeetbread (i la Financiire. — Scrape and skin two sweet- 
breads, then blanch, dip in cold water, and pnt nnder a 
slight pressure ; when quite cold trim, and season them 
with salt and pepper; then lay them in a buttered sauce- 
pan and cook for two or three minutes, turning them con- 
stantly ; then add half a tumblerful of good white bouillon 
and cook until it thickens; then turn the sweetbreads, add 
another half glassful of white bouillon, and cook as before ; 
then arrange in a circle on a very hot dish, cover, and set 
in a hot place while you prepare ^\q financiire. 

Pour into the saucepan in which the sweetbreads were 
cooked a glassful of Khine wine, boil, and strain ; skim 
and put back into the saucepan, cook until it thickens, and 
add an equal quantity of brown sauce, and four raw truffles 
peeled and cut into quarters; cook five minutes, and add 
some button mushrooms and a pinch of cayenne ; when it 
boils up take it from the fire, add to it twenty small force- 
meat balls, poached, and pour all into the hollow left by 
the circle of sweetbreads. {Ddidoiis,) 

Sweetbread Croquettes (Augustine's). — Cut into dice three 
or four cooked sweetbreads, and mix with them half the 
quantity of breast of boiled chicken pounded to a paste, 
and a little rolled bread crnmbs softened with rich cream; 
mix all smoothly togetlier, adding more cream, as much as 
is necessary to soften the paste ; when very soft — as soft 
as it can be and hold together — season with salt, white 
pepper, and a soupgon of nutmeg ; set aside to cool ; when 
cold form into oval balls, rolling in bread crumbs, dipping 
in beaten egg, then rolling in bread crnmbs again ; fry in 
a wire basket, drain on soft paper, and serve on a folded 
napkin, or on a dish surrounded by green pease. 

Sweetbreads d la Virginie. — Prepare the sweetbreads 
very carefully and blanch ; put them into a strong stock 
of chicken or beef, well seasoned with onion and celery ; 
simmer gently for three hours; take them out, drain, and 



MEATS— VEAL. 115 

fry in lard to a light brown ; serve on a very hot dish sur- 
rounded by green pease. 

Sweetbreads d la Blanchette. — Prepare the sweetbreads 
as above, and blanch; put them into a strong chicken 
stock flavored with onion and celery ; simmer gently for 
three hours; take them out, drain^ and serve in a rich 
white sauce with a good deal of roasted parsley in it. 



MUTTON. 

Boast Saddle of Mutton d la Virginie. — ^Wash the sad- 
dle thoroughly, inside and out, with good vinegar ; do not 
wipe it, but hang up to dry in a cool cellar ; when quite 
dry cover with a clean cloth, or tie in a loose muslin bag ; 
sponge oflE with vinegar every other day for a fortnight, 
keeping the meat in a very cold place and always covered. 
When ready to cook wipe it carefully with a clean cloth, 
and roast, basting for the first two hours with butter and 
water, and afterwards with the gravy. A large saddle of 
mutton will require four hours to roast; when roasted, 
dish on a hot dish, and keep covered while you skim the 
gravy, and add half a teacupful of mushroom catsup, a 
glassful of Madeira wine, and a tablespoonful of browned 
flour ; boil up once, and send to table in a sauce-boat ; al- 
ways serve currant jelly with mutton. 

Mutton Sam (" Common-Sense in the Household "). — 
Leg of mutton weighing twelve pounds; one ounce of 
black pepper; a quarter of a pound of brown sugar; one 
ounce of saltpetre ; one and a quarter pounds of salt. 

The day after the sheep is killed, mix the sugar, pepper, 
and saltpetre, and rub tlioroughly into the meat for fifteen 
minutes, until the outer part is thoroughly impregnated 
with the seasoning. Put the ham into a large earthenware 
vessel and cover it with the salt ; let it remain thus for 
three weeks, turning it daily and basting it with the brine, 
adding to this, after the first week, a teacupful of vinegar. 
When the ham is removed from the pickle, wash with cold 
water, then with vinegar, and hang it up in a cool cellar 



MEATS-MUTTON. HY 

for a week, at least, before it is used. Soak an hoar in 
fair water before boiling. 

Or, if you choose to smoke it for several days after 
it is corned, it can be chipped and eaten raw like dried 
beef. 

Mutton Chops. — Trim ofE all superfluous fat and skin, 
and broil on a gridiron over a clear fire ; when cooked, 
salt and pepper lightly, and stick a bit of butter on each. 
Chops must be rare always. A too well done chop is a 
chop spoiled. 

Stewed Mutton Cutlets. — Cut and shape the cutlets from 
the best part of the neck ; cut the bones short and scrape 
the ends, and take most of the fat off ; put them into a 
deep dish, after they have been peppered and salted, with 
seasoned beef gravy ; let them stew for three hours in a 
slow oven ; the dish should be kept covered ; serve with 
the liquor in which they have been stewed, to which a 
teaspoonf ul of mushroom catsup and the same of tarragon 
vinegar have been added ; arrange in a circle on a round 
dish, putting mashed potatoes or mashed turnips in the 
middle. These cutlets look better if glazed a dark brown 
before being sent to table. 

Broiled Mutton Cutlets. — Cut the cutlets out of a piece 
of the best end of a neck of mutton ; they should be less 
than half an inch thick and neatly trimmed, with not too 
much fat left on them ; give them a few blows with the 
bat, and grill them on or in front of the fire, which should 
be clear and fierce, so that each cutlet be full of juice when 
cut ; sprinkle with salt, and arrange in a circle round a 
heap of potato sautees. 

Two Dishes from One Leg of Mutton, — Cut the leg of 
mutton cleanly across the meat and bone from the shank 
down, with as much meat as will suffice for the meal ; rub 



118 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

it and flour it all over, but especially the cut-meat surface ; 
plunge it at once into a saucepan or pot of boiling water 
to cover it completely, adding some salt, a few grains of 
pepper, and a bunch of parsley ; draw away from the fire 
and allow the water to cool almost completely, then put 
again to the fire and cook slowly, according to weight, till 
quite done to taste ; serve with parsley, onions, capers, sor- 
rel, or any sauce preferred. 

Or, it may be stewed, as above, with a great variety of 
vegetables. The flour and the plunging into boiling wa- 
ter will prevent the juice from escaping, and the meat will 
cut as finely as from a whole boiled leg of mutton. 

Mutton Steak. — From the rest of the leg of mutton cut 
cleanly and evenly a slice from the full round of two or 
three inches thick ; pepper and flour both sides at once, 
and insert a piece of shallot onion in the bone eye ; broil 
the meat slowly on a beefsteak griddle, covering the up- 
per surface with chopped beef marrow, butter, or mutton 
kidney fat; prepare a brown gravy with fried shallots, 
brown stock, a few peppercorns, two cloves, some lemon 
rings or juice, or a spoonful of tarragon vinegar ; strain, 
and add some split olives or pounded anchovies. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton & VAnglaise, — Put your leg of 
mutton in boiling water (salted) ; add twelve whole tur- 
nips, trimmed and cleaned ; let it boil till done. You 
allow half an hour for every three pounds of the meat. 
Drain it and serve it on a dish surrounded by the turnips ; 
decorate the handle of the gigot with frilled paper; serve 
with caper sauce. 

Sheep Kidneys. — Slice your kidneys; put them in a 
saucepan with a lump of butter, sliced onion, chopped 
parsley, and a little flour ; add a little water or bouillon, 
salt and pepper, and, just before serving, a glassful of Ma- 
deira. 



MEATS— MUTTON. 119 

Hochepot. — Cnt up pieces of the breast, shoulder, and 
chops ; fry them in butter in a saucepan ; take them out 
and make a rcmx in your saucepan ; when it browns add 
water, salt, pepper, a soup bunch, and a clove of garlic ; put 
back your mutton, and when it is nearly done add some 
turnips which you have fried in butter till they are a gold 
color ; cook half an hour, skim, and serve. You can sub- 
stitute Irish potatoes and carrots for turnips. 

Stewed Breast of Mutton. — Cut your breast in pieces ; 
stew it in a saucepan with butter, a little water, onions, a 
bay leaf, salt and pepper ; just before serving stir in a cup- 
ful of cream and a little chopped parsley.

liver and haslets ; pound all this in a mortar to a paste ; 
season this with grated onions, a bay leaf, thyme, and pars- 
ley, salt and pepper, sliced cepa and truffles, half a clove 
of garlic, pounded; moisten with olive-oil, and bind it

Baked Leg of Mutton with Anchovies and Ham. — 
Pound your gigot; lard it with six cloves of garlic, salted, 
and sprinkled with pepper and with strips of lean ham ; 
put your gigot in a saucepan with a quart of good bouillon ; 
add salt, pepper, a bay leaf, nutmeg, a Bordeaux glassful 
of brandy ; cook on a gentle fire. 

Make an anchovy butter; pound a dozen anchovies

be made the moment the gigot is cooked. 

Take your gigot out of the saucepan for a moment ; let 
your sauce boil up ; skim it, and pour it in the saucepan 
with your anchovy butter; return your gigot to the sauce-

pan, and let it set on hot coals until you are ready to 
serve ; dress your gigot on a dish and pour over the sauce. 

Saddle of Mutton with Parsley. — Lard your saddle with 
fresh parsley, just as you would with strips of bacon ; spit 
it and baste it well. It will require one hour and a half 
to cook. 

Stuffed Roast Leg of Mutton. — Lift up the dry skin that 
covers the leg carefully, without taking it oflE entirely; 
lard your gigot with celery half cooked in bouillon, slices 
of pickles, tender bunches of estragon bleached, strips of 
fat pork ; season it well, and sprinkle it with chopped an- 
chovies ; draw the skin over the stuffing, fasten it careful- 
ly with thread, put it on the spit, and serve it in its own 
juice. 

Mutton Stew (Old Virginia dish). — Take pieces of cold 
roast mutton, cut them up in dice, and put them in a chaf- 
ing-dish with a large lump of butter, a glassful of currant 
jelly, some mango pickles sliced, and a glassful of good 
old Madeira; salt and pepper; light the spirit-lamp, let it

cook them in a saucepan with slices of bacon, chopped 
mushrooms, salt, spices, parsley, and thyme, and serve. 

Mutton Tongues with Tomatoes, — Boil and skin your 
tongue ; split it lengthwise ; season, and pour over it a 
rich tomato sauce. 

Cutlets d la Victime. — Fasten three cutlets together, the 
finest one in the middle ; broil them on the gridiron, turn-

ing them several times that the juice may concentrate in 
the middle one ; when the upper and lower ones are more 
than done put them aside, and serve only the middle one. 
This was a favorite dish of Louis XVIII. 

CuUets d la Milanaise. — Dip your cutlets in melted but- 
ter, and then into pounded bread crumbs and grated par- 
mesan cheese ; beat np two eggs, dip your cutlets in this, 
then again into the bread crumbs and cheese ; fry them in 
butter, and serve them with tomato sauce. 

Veiled Cutlets. — Take fillet cutlets — those without bones 
— trim and flatten them, cover them with a thin layer of sau- 
sage meat in which you chop a few truffles ; envelop them 
in the thin membrane that covers the fat of pork, and broil 
them. 

Cutlets d la Vinaigrette. — Cook your chops in a frying- 
pan with butter ; when they are done drain them on brown 
paper ; add several spoonfuls of bouillon to the butter, es- 
chalottes, fine herbs, salt and pepper, and pickles cut in 
slices ; let it boil up ; dress your cutlets on a dish ; pour 
the sauce over them, adding a dash of vinegar.

LAMB. 

The receipts given above for mutton apply equally to 
lamb ; but the cook must always bear in mind that though 
lamb may be stewed^ it ought never to be boiled, and that 
underdone lamb is an abomination, and also indigestible. 

Quarter of Lamb Larded and Roasted, — Lard the lamb 
carefully with a larding needle, envelop in buttered pa- 
per, and roast on the spit, or in a Dutch oven ; when al- 
most cooked, remove the paper, dust lightly with salt and 
roasted parsley, and serve with maitre d^hdtd sauce. 

FiUets of Lamb d, la Bechamel. — Make a good bechamel 
sauce ; when you are ready to serve, put into it some cold 
roast lamb cut into very thin slices, heat, but do not boil, 
and, when very hot, serve. 

Lamb ci la Poulette. — Blanch a quarter of lamb ; then 
put a lump of butter into a casserole together w^ith a 
spoonful of fine flour; when the flour and butter are 
well amalgamated, add two or three glassfuls of boiling 
water; add the water little by little so that it may mix 
well with the butter; when the sauce is smooth and 
clear put in the lamb, pepper, salt, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, some button onions ; half an hour before serving 
add some mushrooms; when cooked, put the lamb on a 
very hot dish, and arrange the onions and mushrooms in 
such a way as to garnish it; strain the sauce, beat up 
with it the yolk of an Qgg^ pour over the lamb, and 
serve. 



PORK. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

All hogs should be kept shut up, and well fed for three 
weeks before they are killed ;; their sties should be oleaned 
daily, and they should be furnished with an abundance. of 
fresh water. A pig should not be allowed to eat any- 
thing for twenty-four hours before he is killedi After 
killing be very careful to keep, the pork from tainting. 
It spoils very easily. All kinds of pork should be cooked 
thoroughly. Underdone pork is very unwholeSora6, as 
well as unpalatable. 

Pork requires ai great ddal of cooking, and is never, fit 
to eat when underdone. Otherwise the usual rules for 
roasting and boiling meats will apply to it. Pork chops 
and steaks are cooked as those of mutton or beef. : ! 



Loin of Pork Hodsted.^ Loin of pork is. generally 
scored across the skin, and may be stuffed- with a rich 
stuffing of bread, onion, and herbs ; apple sauce is gener- 
ally eaten with all roast pork. 

Young Pig Boasted. — Prepare for roasting, and stuff 
as you would a turkey, but put more onion and dried and 
powdered herbs in the stuffing ; serve on a hot dish, sur- 
rounded by a wreath of crisped parsley and slided lemon.' 



^usi/rian Boast Pig. — Kill your pig; lay it in coldr 
water fifteen minutes; then plunge it in boiling Avater ; 
scrape the hair off; clean it perfectly ; cut it open ; takft 



124 THE UNKIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

out the entrails; wash thoroughly with clear water"; then 
with soda and water, and lastly with salt and water ; make 
a stuflSng with the pig's liver, fat pork, truffles, mushrooms, 
a little garlic, capers, hazelnuts, thyme and parsley, salt 
and red pepper ; fry it in your frying-pan, and stuff your 
pig; sew him up and truss; bend his fore-feet backwards, 
his hind-feet forwards, under and close to the body ; take 
a sharp knife, cut tlie skin of the pig in diamonds ; rub 
your pig with melted butter or oil ; put it to roast with 
a little hot water, slightly salted, in the dripping-pan ; 
baste with butter and water; rub it over every few mo- 
ments with oil to have the skin crisp; it requires two 
hours to cook over a brisk and steady fire ; serve it with 
an apple in its mouth, and garnish the dish with parsley, 
chiccory, or curled celery. 

JSoast /^arerib.— When put down to the fire, cover 
with greased paper until half done, then remove the pa- 
per and dredge with flour. Afterwards baste with but- 
ter, and lastly with the gravy of the sparerib itself; just 
before taking it up dust with rolled bread crumbs, a fine- 
ly minced shallot, pepper, salt, and powdered sage ; let it 
cook five minutes longer, basting it meanwhile with but- 
ter ; skim the gravy ; add half a cupful of red wine ; thick- 
en with browned flour ; add the juice of a lemon ; strain, 
and pour over the «parerib. 

Haast Chine, — Score deeply and closely the strip of 
skin running along the neck; then roast as you roast 
sparerib. 

Baked Pork and Beam. — One quart of small white 
beans, washed, picked over, and soaked all night in luke- 
warm water, which should be changed twice for more and 
warmer -Water ; one pound of the middling of salt pork. 

In the morning pour the water off the beans, and put 
thenfi into an eartheo crock ; score very deeply the salt

pork and imbed it iu the beans, leaving the skin level 
with the beans; cover all hardy with water in which a 
heaping tablespoonf ul of molasses has been stirred ; add 
some black pepper ; then cover all with a stiff, thick dough 
of flour and water, leaving a hole in the middle for the 
beans to brown ; bake aU day^ very slowly, in a cool oven ; 
lift the dough occasionaUy to see if there is enough water ; 
if too dry, add boiling water ; towards the last the beans 
should absorb all the water; remove the paste and serve 
the pork and beans in the crock in which they were cooked. 
Earthenware crocks made expressly for this purpose may 
be bought in ]N'ew England. 

Pork and Beans. — One quart of white beans; one 
pound of salt pork. 

Prepare beans and pork for cooking as above, but in

pepper and salt, and add two eggs well beaten, two table-- 
spoonfuls of butter, a teaspoonful of brown sugar, and 
pepper to taste; beat all well together, and tie loosely in 
a floured pudding cloth ;' put it, with the pork, into warm 
water, and. boil together for an hour; lay the pork in a 
dish, turn out the pudding, slice, and arrange about the 
meat. 

Boiled Haniy No. 1. — ^A ham should be put into cold water 
enough to cover it. As soon as the water boils set it aside, 



126 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

where it will only siraraer, for eight hours; then take it 
out, remove the skin, and pat the ham again into the ket- 
tle, and let it remain until the water has cooled ; then take 
it out, trim it nicely, sprinkle over it pounded cracker and 
brown sugar, and brown in an oven. 



. Boiled Hdm^^Oi 2. — Soak over-night in cold water; in 
the morning wash and put on to boil in cold water; allow 
a quarter of an hour to a pound, and do not boil too fast; 
skin, and brown as above. 

Baked Ham. — Wash carefnlly and soak over-night a 
medium-sized ham ; early in the morning put it into fresh 
water enough to cover it, and set it on the fire to boil ; 
when it begins to boil set it back, and let.it simmer for 
four hours, filling the boiler, as it needs, with boiling wa- 
ter ; take it out at the expiration of the four hours, and' 
skin it while hot; trim off the edges carefully and neatly; 
then grate over it (half an inch deep) bread crumbs and a 
sprinkle of brown sugar ; put the ham into a dripping-pan 
with half a pint of its own drippings (in which you have 
dissolved a pinch of brown sugar) and a pint of Madeira 
wine ; put in the oven to bake, and baste every few min- 
utes until the ham i& well browned and every drop of the 
wine absorbed. • 

Steamed Ham. — Soak in cold water twelve houi-s; then 
wash, rubbing thoroughly with a stifif brush ; plunge again, 
for a moment, in cold water; take out the ham, put into 
a steamer, cover closely, and set over a pot of boiling wa- 
ter; keep the water at a hard boil, and allow twenty min- 
utes to a pound; skin, sprinkle with bread crumbs, etc., 
as foi^ boiled ham. 

Boast Ham, No. 1. — Take a new ham that has been 
salted some weeks only ; if smoked, parboil it before roast- 
ing ; while it is before the fire baste it with white wine' 



MEATS—PORK. 127 

and loaf sngar ; when half done remove the skin, stick the 
ham f nil of cloves, and let it roast as long again, basting it 
with fresh wine and sugar until thoroughly cooked. 

Boast Ham^ No. 2 ("Common-Sense in the House- 
hold"). — Soak a large ham for two days in lukewarm wa- 
ter, changing the water at least six times a day; take it 
out, wash thoroughly, |ind trim away the black and rusty 
edges; skin carefully and completely; lay in a dish, and 
sponge with a cloth dipped in the following mixture, which 
should be well mixed : One tumblerful of white wine ; 
half a gill of strong vinegar; one tablespoonful of white 
sugar, heaped ; one saltspoonf ul of made mustard. 

Do this thoroughly once every hour — turning the ham 
and sponging every part of it — all day until bedtime; re- 
new the process in the morning until six horn's before you 
need the meat; put it on the spit, and add to the mixture 
above mentioned a cupful of boiling water ; baste the ham 
perpetually with this until it drips freely, then baste with 
its own drippings ; when cooked cover the ham with rolled 
bread crnmbs workied to a paste with cream, butter, beaten 
egg, and a little pepper, and I'etnrn to the oven to brown ; 
skim the gravy, add a glassful of good wine, a tablespoon- 
ful of walnut catsup, the juice of a lemon, and a soupqon 
oi nutmeg ; boil up, and send to table in a sauce-boat. 

Barhecued Ham, — Cut in slices; wash well and soak in 
very hot water for half an hour ; pour ofiE the water and 
add more, scalding hot; let the hain stand half an hour; 
then take it ont, wipe dry, lay in cold water for five min- 
utes, wipe dry again, and arrange the slices in a large fry- 
ing-pan, putting on each slice a saltspoonf ul of made mus- 
tard and half a teaspoonful of vinegar; pepper well; fry 
quickly and turn often ; when done to a fine brown trans- 
fer to a hot dish, add to the gravy in the pan half a glass- 
ful of ^vine and a very small teaspoonful of white sugar; 
boil up and poiir over the meat. 



128 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

UroUed Ham. — Soak, etc., as above, and broil on a well 
buttered gridiron over a clear, fierce fire. 

Broiled Ham au Gratin {Cuisini^re Bourgeoise). — 
Soak, etc., as above ; dip each slice in beaten egg and bread 
crumbs, and broil on a buttered gridiron over a clear fire.- 

Fried Ham. — Take raw ham ; slice and soak as above ; 
cook in a hot frying-pan, turning often until done ; pour 
over the ham, when dished, the gravy in the frying-pan ; 
if you choose you may add to the gravy in the frying-pan 
a little cream thickened with flour, and a teaspoonf nl of 
powdered parsley ; boil up once and pour over the ham. 

Cold Ham^ Fried. — Cut thick slices of cold boiled ham, 
dip in beaten egg, then in rolled bread crumbs, and fry in 
fat extracted from bits of salt pork ; take the dry fried 
pork from the pan before putting in the ham; garnish 
with curled parsley. 

Ham and Eggs, — Cut the raw ham in large, even slices ; 
soak and dry as usual ; fry quickly in a large frying-pan ; 
the moment they are done put into a hot dish, cover, and 
fry the eggs in the fat left by the ham ; take care that 
the eggs do not touch each other; fry them three minutes, 
lay one egg on each slice of ham, and serve. 

Ham Sandwiches. — Cut some rather stale bread very 
thin, having previously grated off the crust ; butter each 
slice on the loaf before cutting it ; lay between every two 
slices some cold boiled ham from which yon have removed 
the fat; spread the meat with a very little mustard. 

Oround'Ham Sandwiches. — Grind some cold boiled 
ham very fine, then dry in the oven to a light powder. 
Take an oblong white loaf, rather stale; grate off the 
crust ; butter as above ; spread thickly with ground ham, 



M£ATS— FOBK« 129 

cut very thin, and roll up like wafers. These are very 
pretty sandwiches. 

Ham-and-Ghioken Sandwiches. — Equal quantities of 
cold roast chicken and boiled ham; mince very fine; put 
into a saucepan with enough gravy— veal or chicken — to 
make a soft paste ; or, failing gravy, use cream, hot water, 
and a lump of butter ; cook five minutes, then take from 
the fire and spread on a dish to cool. Cut (with a cake 
cutter) some white bread into rounds, half or a quarter of 
an inch thick; butter, spread with grated cheese, then 
with the mince, and press the rounds firmly together. 

Lard, — Take leaf lard, skin carefully, wasli, drain, cut 
into bits, throw in a large tin kettle, and set this in a pot 
of boiling water; stir from time to time, letting it simmer 
gently until clear, throwing in, also, a little salt to make 
the sediment settle; when quite hot and clear strain 
through a coarse cloth into jars, being careful not to press 
it. Lard keeps longer and better in small jars. Cover 
with bladder. 

To Try out Lard. — Take all the fatty portions of pork 
left next the skin of the hog ; scrape from the rind and 
cut into dice ; fill a large pot, put in a cupful of water to 
prevent burning, and melt very slowly, stirring eveiy three 
minutes ; simmer until nothing remains of the meat but 
fibrous bits; remove these carefully with a perforated 
skimmer, throw in a little salt to settle the fat, and when 
clear strain through a coarse cloth into small jars. Ee- 
member to simmer gently over a steady fire, stirring con- 
stantly and from the bottom until the salt is thrown in to 
settle it, then withdraw it to a less hot part of the fire un- 
til clear. Do not leave it an instant ; a moment's burning 
will ruin everything. 

Headcheeae. — Boil the head, ears, and tongue in salted

130 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

water until tender ; strip the meat from the bones, and cut 
the tongne into oblongs, squares, and triangles; grind the 
rest of the meat fine ; season with salt, pepper, sage, sweet 
marjoram, powdered cloves, and half a cnpfnl of strong 
vinegar; mix all together thoronghly, and pack hard in 
moulds or bowls ; press down the meat tightly ; pnt a wet 
.plate and a heavy weight on each for two days. If you 
wish to keep it for weeks, immerse the cheese in cold vin- 
egar in stone jars. Headcheese is good cold ; but may be 
sliced, dipped in beaten egg and bread crumbs, and fried ; 
or else cut in slices and seasoned slightly with mustard, 
and warmed. 

Pork Potpie. — Line a well-buttered pot with good, 
light paste; put in a layer of chine of ix)rk, cut into rib- 
lets ; then a layer of parboiled potatoes, sliced ; season 
with salt and pepper ; proceed in this way until the pot is 
nearly full, putting some strips of paste into each layer ; 
then pour in a quart of cold water and put on the upper 
crust, cutting a slit in it ; put on the pot-lid and boil from 
an hour and a half to two hours; when done lay in upper 
crust in a large, hot dish, put in the meat, etc., and cover 
with the lower crust. 

Ham-andrOhicken Pie. — Line a buttered pie-dish with 
good puff paste, and fill up with alternate layers of cold 
ham and boiled chicken, interspersing each layer with 
slices of hard-boiled egg buttered and peppered; then 
pour in a cupful of chicken and roux^ cover with paste, 
and bake an hour. 

Brawn. — Pig's head weighing six pounds ; one pound 
of lean beef ; one shallot minced fine ; one teaspoonf ul of 
salt ; half a teaspoonf ul of pepper ; half a teaspoonf ul of 
cayenne ; half a teaspoonf ul of mace ; one pinch of cloves. 

Clean and wash the head, and stew with the beef in 
enough cold water to cover; when the flesh is loosened 



MEATS— rOBK. 131 

from the bones, remove them and drain oflE the liquor; 
grind the jneat finely while it is hot; season, mix, and 
pour into a tin boar's head wet with cold water. 

Saveloys. — Eight pounds of pork (soaked in a brine of 
salt and water with a tablespoonful of saltpetre) for three 
days ; four teaspoonfuls of black pepper ; one teaspoonf ul 
of cayenne ; one teaspoonf ul of cloves or mace ; one tea- 
cupful of bread crumbs ; eight teaspoonfuls of sage, sweet 
marjoram, and thyme, powdered ; a brine of salt and wa- 
ter with a tablespoonful of saltpetre, and leave it for three 
days. 

Dry, mince, season, mix, stuff into skins, and steam over 
boiling water one hour. 

Clieshire Pork Pie. — Two or three pounds of lean fresh 
pork cut into strips two inches long and one wide ; an equal 
weight of juicy apples, pared, cored, and cut into slices. 

Line a buttered dish with puff paste ; put in a layer of 
pork, then of apples covered with an ounce of white sug- 
ar, then pork; proceed in this way until the dish is full, 
seasoning each layer of pork with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg; when the dish is full pour in half a pint of sweet 
cider, and stick bits of tutter over the top; cover with a 
thick lid of puff paste, cut .'a slit in the top, and bake for 
an hour and a half ; binish the top with beaten egg before 
baking. 

Yorkshire Pork Pie. — ^Make and bake as above, omit- 
ting apples, sugar, and nutmeg, and adding sage to the 
seasoning. 

Hopping John (Old Virginia receipt). — One pint of lady 
pease ; one quart of rice ; one pound of bacon. 

Boil the pease and bacon together until soft, then add 
the rice, well washed ; stir well, and boil until it boils up ; 
then pour off the water, leaving just enough to cover it ; 



132 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

cover and set on a slow fire until thoroughly done ; when 
you pour the water off add a teaspoonful of whole black 
pepper. 

To Cure Hams (Old Virginia receipt). — One hundred 
pounds of meat; six gallons of hot water; nine pounds of 
salt; four pounds of brown sugar; three ounces of salt- 
petre, dissolved alone. 

Put all the pickle into a large vessel and boil for half 
an hour, skimming off the scum ; do not put it on the hams 
until cold ; then pour it over so as to saturate them thorough- 
ly, and let it remain a few days ; after a fortnight or sixteen 
days take the hams from the pickling barrel ; wash off the 
pickle, and while wet dip in bran ; when well covered 
with bran hang in the smoke, the hock end downward ; 
keep up a good smoke for four weeks, having the fire par- 
tially smothered with hickory chips and sawdust, and be- 
ing careful not to let tlie house become hot; then take 
down the meat, brush off the bran, examine closely for in- 
sects, and lay in the hot sun for a day or two. 

Hams may be kept packed in slaked ashes, in dry oats, 
or in bran — best in slaked ashes. 

Or, they may be covered with brown paper, then witli 
coarse muslin stitched tightly, and whitewashed. 

Or, in coarae muslin coated with a mixture of beeswax 
and rosin. 

PioMed Pork, — Proceed as above ; but if you do not 
smoke, take the pork out of the barrel at the end of a fort- 
night, rub each piece with salt, and return it to the barrel. 
If the liquor does not cover it make fresh brine, in the 
proportion of two pounds of salt, a quarter of an ounce of 
saltpetre, and a quart of water ; boil half an hour, cool, 
and pour over the pork. Pork should, if possible, be pic- 
kled within twenty-four hours after butchering. 

Virginia Bacon, — The pork must be well fattened with 



M1UT&-P0BK. 133 

corn, and not ciit out until the day after it is killed; salt 
it thoroughly with fine salt and ground alum mixed, and 
a teaspoonful of saltpetre rubbed well into the hocks be- 
fore the salt is applied ; lay it carefully in tubs, with the 
skin down, for four weeks ; at the end of that time hang 
up the middlings, joints, and chines; have the bones and 
shoulders covered with nicely burned hickory ashes well 
sifted ; let them He two weeks, then hang up with the 
hocks down ; keep up a smoke (not tire) as directed for 
hams. Be careful not to let one piece touch another in 
hanging. 

Towards the spring, when tlie weather is warm and 
damp, put in just wood enough to keep alive, and at least 
once a day a good deal of tobacco and red pepper. This 
is necessary, as it destroys all flies and insects. It is best, 
occasionally, to have a smoke of that sort all the spring. 
Your meathouse must be dry, and have air-holes bored 
high up in the gable ends, or a lattice door you can lock, 
opening the close door in fine weather. Kill the hogs on 
the increase of the moon. By following these directions 
you are sure to have good bacon. 

Never salt pork in whiskey barrels ; molasses barrels are 
best. 

Virgmia Sausage Meat^ No. 1.— One bushel of meat, 
chopped very fine ; one teacupful of red pepper ; one tea- 
cupful of black; one teacupful of sugar; two teacupfuls

in a close vessel. If yoa wish to stuff them, use some 
nicely cleaned chitterlings which have been kept in salt 
and water ten days or a fortnight ; stuff, hang on sticks, 
and dry. A little smoke improves them ; too much makes 
them bitter. 

Sausage^ No. 3. — Two pounds of lean pork ; two pounds 
of veal ; two pounds of beef suet ; peel of half a lemon ; 
one grated nutmeg; one teaspoonfnl of black pepper; one 
teaspoonful of brown sugar; five teaspoonfuls of salt;

Sausage^ No. 4. — Six pounds of lean fresh pork ; three 
pounds of fat; one grated nutmeg; twelve teaspoonfuls 
of powdered sage ; six teaspoonfuls of salt ; six teaspoon- 
fuls of black pepper ; two teaspoonfuls of mace ; two tea-

Grind the meat in a sausage-mill, mix in the seasoning, 
and pack in stone jars, pouring melted lard on top. 

Bologna Sausage. — Two pounds of lean veal; two 
pounds of pork; two pounds of beef; two pounds of fat, 
nnsmoked, salt pork ; one pound of beef suet ; four spoon- 
fuls of savory, thyme, parsle}'', and marjoram ; one grated 
nutmeg; one teaspoonful of cloves; two teaspoonfuls of 
black pepper, and the same of red ; one minced onion ; 
salt to taste. 

Grind, mix well, season, and stuff into beef skins ; tie 
them up, prick each skin in several places, put on the fire 
in hot water, and heat gradually to boiling-point; boil 
slowly one hour ; take out the skins and lay on fresh, clean 
straw or hay, in the sun, to dry ; rub the outside of the 
skins with melted butter or fine olive-oil, then with pep- 
per, and hang in a cool, dry place. If properly made and 
hung this sausage will keep two or three weeks. 



MEATS— PORK. 135 

Soused Pig^s Feet. — Take yonng and tender feet, cover 
with water, and boil very slowly; wlien boiled almost 
to rags take them from the fire and sprinkle a little salt 
over them ; set them away to cool, and when cold remove 
tlie grease from the top and the bones ; take them from 
the liquor, and add to the liquor an equal quantity of 
strong and good vinegar, also a tablespoonf ul of brown 
sugar, one and a half tablespoonfuls of salt, whole popper,

POULTRY. 

GENEBAL DIRECTIONS. 

All poultry should be picked and drawn as soon as 
killed. Never buy undrawn poultry ; it may be uneatable, 
because flavored by the foul contents of the craw and in- 
testines. If you keep poultry, starve for twenty-four 
hours before killing; but even in this case pick and draw 
at once. Never eat poultry until at least eight hours after 
it has been killed ; and, before stuflSng it, wash out well 
in at least three waters, putting a pinch of soda into the 
last. The following receipts are available for roasting 
on the spit, for Dutch ovens, or for baking in the range 
oven. 

DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING GAME AND POULTRY (sOYER)* 

Hang up the poultry about ten inches from the fire ; 
let it hang for ten minutes to set the skin ; then press into 
a wooden spoon a piece of butter or lard dripping; when 
the skin is very hot, rub it over with the fat in the spoon 
until all is melted ; then draw it back to about twelve inch- 
es. A good-sized fowl will take three quarters of an hour ; 
chicken, twenty minutes; middle-sized game, one hour; 
turkey, fourteen pounds, two hours and a half ; large hare, 
one hour and a half; if very young, three quarters of an 
hour. Never baste them ; but, having rubbed them well 
with butter, dredge them carefully. , 

Small game should be placed nearer the fire. 

Apple sauce should be served with goose ; currant or 
grape jelly with hare ; fried bread crumbs with grouse ; 
bread sauce with partridge and pheasant.

ing the directions given above. 

Stew the giblets and necks in just enough water to cov- 
er them; and when the fowls are removed to a hot dish, 
add the chopped giblets and the liquor to the gravy in the 
dripping-pan ; boil up once, thicken with browned flour, 
boil again, and serve in a gi'avy-boat. 

Boiled Chicken. — Prepare precisely as above, baste np 
in floured cloths, and put into a pot with enough boiling 
water to cover them well ; stew slowly an hour or more, 
being guided by size and toughness ; serve with egg sauce. 

Spring Chicken^ Broiled. — Split the chickens down the 
back, and broil them before the fire in a folding wire- 
broiler, turning them frequently ; dust them witli a little 
flour, and baste them with butter ; when cooked tlirough 
place them on a hot dish, rub more butter over them, and 
serve hot.

gravy with veal trimmings, mace, onion, salt, and white 
pepper ; when sufficiently done, strain the liquor from the 
meat, and return it to the saucepan ; have the chicken cut 
up and place it in this gravy ; stew gently until it is well 
cooked ; then thicken the gravy with well-mixed butter 
and flour; beat into a gill of cream the yolks of two 
eggs, and pour it into the saucepan just before taking it 
from the fire. 

Chicken and Tomatoes, — Four small chickens cut in 
pieces ; six large tomatoes ; two onions ; three large green 
peppers, seeds and veins removed ; small bunch of sweet 
herbs; a slice of salt pork cut into dice; three cloves; a 
few peppercorns ; half a tumblerful of white wine, and

little salt and a blade of mace, and cover it with water ; 
cover closely and cook until tender ; line a deep dish with 
puff paste, and cut some squares of paste with a jagging- 
iron ; when the chicken is cooked, put it into the dish with 
the squares of paste, also a lump of butter, some pepper, 
and a little rich cream ; add, also^ the liquor in which the 
chicken was cooked, thickened with butter and flour ; cov-

like the staves of a barrel; cut a large, fine chicken into 
small pieces, salt and pepper, it, and put it into the pot 
with a quarter of an onion minced fine, two potatoes sliced 
thinly, and some large, flat dumplings of rich paste; rub 
some flour and butter together, stir in some hot water, and 
make the mixture smooth; pour this over the chicken, 



POULTRY. 113 

and if it is not enongli to cover it add a little warm milk 
and water; then turn the tops of the crust lining Uie pot 
over the chicken^ and make a lid of crust to go over the 
whole; a hole in the middle of this must be left for the 
gravy to bubble through; the crust must be thick; when 
the pie is cooked, serve it on a large dish, place the chick- 
en in the middle, and arrange the pieces which lined the 
pot, and ought to be well browned, on the outside, putting 
the softer crust and dumplings inside. 

Chicken Pvdding. — Four chickens; ten eggs beaten 
light ; one quart of milk mixed with the eggs ; a quarter 
of a pound of butter melted, with the eggs ; flour enough 
to make a batter stirred in last of all. 

Cut up the chickens in large pieces, and put them, in a 
saucepan with salt, pepper, parsley, a stick of celery, and

in a deep baking-dish ; pour the batter over all and bake it. 

Chicken Pillau, — One chicken ; one teacupful of rice, 
well washed and soaked for an hour ; pepper and salt to 
taste ; one blade of mace. 

Cut up the chicken as for fricassee ; let it simmer slow- 
ly with just enough water to cover it ; when it has cooked 
for twenty minutes add the seasoning ; allow it to cook a 
little longer, or until quite tender; then take itofi the 
lire, drain the rice, and put it in the pot with about a pint 
of the liquor in which the chicken was boiled ; salt it, and 
let it boil till nearly done ; then drain off most of the liq- 
uor, put the chicken into the middle of the rice, and stew 
gently. 

Florida PiUau. — One fat chicken cut up in small 
pieces; one onion; one clove of garlic; five tomatoes; 
one piece of pork. 

Fry all the above ingredients lightly in butter ; then 



144 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

put into a pot a pint of rice, water enough to cover it, a 
little salt, pepper, and allepice, the chicken, pork, and veg- 
etables, and cook all slowly together ; when the rice is suf- 
ficiently cooked, put the pot on one side of the fire to sim- 
mer gently until it is time to serve it. 

Baked PiMau. — Two boiled fowls cut up in small 
pieces. Reserve a part of the water in which the fowls 
have been cooked in which to boil the rice, keeping the rest 
to add afterwards; when the rice is done mix it with but- 
ter, lay one half in the bottom of a deep dish, lay the fowls 
upon it, and pnt the other half of tlie rice on top, add- 
ing the remainder of the liquor; then spread over all the 
well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and bake it in a moderate 
oven. 

Pressed Chicken. — Put a fowl into a porcelain-lined ket- 
tle with salt, a few whole cloves and whole allspice, bnt no 
water ; cook two honrs or more d hain-marie ; then remove 
the skin and bones, chop the dark and light meat together, 
and place them in a dish ; pour over it the strained liquor 
which remained in the kettle ; let it cool, then fold it tight- 
ly in a cloth, and press with a heavy weight; slice and 
serve cold. 

Fried Chicken. — Out the chickens in pieces, and season 
them with pepper and salt and a dust of meal ; then fry 
them in butter, lay them on paper, and cover them to keep 
them warm; then pour the grease out of the frying-pan, 
and put into it a teacupful of cream, a blade of mace, a 
little salt and pepper, a saltspoonf al of flour, and a tea- 
spoonful of butter mixed together; let these simmer to- 
gether a few minutes ; place the chicken on a hot dish, 
and pour the sauce over it. 

Chicken Pie. — Cut one or two chickens in small pieces ; 
put them in a saucepan with a little water, pepper, salt, a 



POULTRY. 145 

blade of mace, and a stick of celery; cover close) 3% and let 
the chicken simmer slowly, turning it often ; when nearly 
cooked take the chicken out of the water; skim the water, 
and stir in a thickening of flour mixed well with butter ; 
let it thicken over the fire a short time. In the meanwhile 
line a deep baking-dish with rich puff paste ; place the 
chicken in it, together with some hard-boiled eggs cut in 
slices, and the giblets;, add the liquor from the saucepan, 
cover the dish with paste, and bake just long enough to 
bake the crust. 

Chickefh Breasts (Florentine fashion). — Take the breasts 
of several chickens together with the white meat ; prepare 
the breasts by trimming each one into the shape of a cut- 
let ; then make a mince of chicken breasts, the yolks of 
two hard-boiled eggs, and some finely rolled bread crumbs ; 
pound this mince to a paste in the mortar, and then press 
it through a colander; add enough rich, fresh cream to 
bind all together ; flavor with a tiny pinch of nutmeg, a 
coffeespoonf ul of roasted powdered parsley, and two drops 
of essence of celery, salt and pepper to taste ; then with a 
broad-bladed silver or wooden knife spread the mince 
smoothly, thickly, and evenly upon the chicken breasts ; 
it should be fully half an inch thick. Have ready equal 
quantities of tongue and ham cut into tiny rounds and 
lozenges ; dot the chicken breasts with these ; arrange the 
chicken breasts in a large stewpan, so disposing them as 
to leave a small space between each one ; put in a liberal 
lump of fresh butter, and stew over a slow fire for an 
hour; when the butter has been absorbed add enough 
broth to keep the chicken breasts from burning. This is 
a favorite dish all through Italy, where it is possible to 
buy the breasts of a chicken in market without buying 
the whole chicken. I can vouch for the dish as being a 
delicious and pretty entree. 

Stewed Chicken with White Stuffing. — Pick, draw, and. 

7 



146 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

WAsli the chicken in three waters, adding a little soda to 
the last bat one. Prepare the stuffing as follows : Boil a 
quart of good milk with two sticks of celery, a little thyme, 
laurel, basil, and coriander seeds nntil it is reduced to one 
half; strain, and add two ounces of bread cimmbs; re- 
place the casserole on the fire, and keep it there until 
the milk has absorbed all the bread ; then remove it from 
the fire, add more bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, 
twelve almonds blanched and powdered to a paste, a pinch 
of nutmeg, and the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs; mix 
well and smoothly together ; then stuff the chicken, sew 
it up, cover it closely and carefully -with sliced ham, and 
stew in milk until tender; serve with a white sauce. 

Capon with Truffles. — When the capon is picked, singed, 
drawn, and cleaned ready for roasting, peel and scrape clean 
some truffles, and scald them in boiling melted butter, 
with a little pepper and salt ; fill the capon entirely with 
the truffles so prepared ; sew up the opening, and envelope 
the capon carefully and thoroughly in white paper, but- 
tered, and put it in a cool, dry place, for two days or less, 
if the weather be warm ; then roast it in freshly buttered 
paper. When the capon is nearly cooked the paper should 
be removed, and the capon basted with butter nntil it as- 
sumes a fine brown color. 

Capon with Malaga Wine. — Prepare a capon as above, 
substituting, however, a simple ordinary stuffing for the 
truffles. When the two days have expired, put the capon 
in a casserole with some fried onions and ham ; add 
half a bottlef ul of Malaga wine, cover the top of the casserole 
with buttered paper, and again with a casserole cover; 
cook the capon over a slow fire, and serve it with the sauce 
in which it has been cooked, which should be strained to 
free it from grease, and thickened either with browned 
bread crumbs or with pounded chestnuts. A handful of 
finely sliced truffles is a great improvement to this sauce. 



POULTRY. 147 

Capoih d la Oreme. — Take a roasted capon and remove 
the breast, which ponnd to a pnlp in a mortar ; add. to 
this some bread crumbs which have been boiled in milk 
until quite soft, and which should be smoothly mixed 
:With the capon breast; add also about half a pound of 
beef suet, some cold ham finely minced, a small shallot, 
some grated parsley, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, 
two truffles sliced finely, and salt and pepper to taste ;. add 
enough good fresh cream to bind* all together; stuff the 
capon with this, and re-form the breasts, glazing the capon 
with beaten white of eggs, and covering it tliickly with 
lightly browned bread crumbs ; then place the capon in 
a covered casserole, enveloping it with thin slices of ham. 
It should cook until thoroughly heated through and 
through. Then place on a very hot dish and serve.. 

MoastDiuik Stuffed with Celery, — Clean, wash, and wipe 
the ducks very carefully. To the usual dressing add one 
half the quantity of stewed celery, and a minced shallot 
Stuff and sew up as usual, reserving the giblets for the 
gravy. If tender, the ducks will not require more than an 
hour to roast. They should be well basted. Skim the 
gravy before putting in the giblets and thickening. The 
giblets should be stewed in a very little water, then chopped 
fine, and added to the gravy in the dripping-pan, with a 
chopped shallot, and a spoonful of brown flour. Accom- 
pany with currant or grape jelly. 

Salted Ducks (Italian monastery). — The ducks should 
be drawn as soon as possible after being killed, the inside 
thoroughly washed through four waters, third wa&li being 
given with soda water, the last with fresh cold water. They 
should then be picked, singed, and hung up for two days. 
The legs, wings, breast, and the fleshy part of the stomiach 
should then be neatly cut off, thoroughly covered with 
salt, and placed in an earthenware vessel, taking care to 
exclude the air by a thick layer of salt. Let them remain 



148 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

thus for fifteen dajs, then rinse in cold water, afterwards in 
vinegar, then stick the pieces of duck rather thickly with 
cloves ; sprinkle them with celery seed and sweet herbs, 
among which, shonid be some laurel leaves ; a very little 
nitre should also be sprinkled over them in order to give 
the flesh a bright red color. They shonid then be placed 
in jars, and covered with brine. On top of the brine pour 
olive-oil. The oil should be about an inch deep. 

Mocut Goose. — Clean and wash the goose, putting a tea- 
spoonful of soda into the last water but one ; stuff with 
bread crumbs, salt, pepper, a tablespoonf ul of melted butter, 
a large onion chopped tine, a large roast apple ditto, a table- 
spoonful of chopped sage, the yolks of two eggs, and some 
tiny dice of fat pork ; stuff body and craw, and sew up. 
If the fire be clear and fierce, and the goose a large one, it 
will take fully two hours to roast. Cover the breast until 
half done with buttered paper, or a paste of flour and water, 
removing this when yon are ready to brown ; make a 
gravy as for roast duck, adding a glassful of old port, if pos- 
sible, and send to the table with apple sauce. 

Boast Guinea Fowls. — Pick, clean, wash, and stuff as 
you would chickens, adding to the stuffing a little minced 
ham. Eoast as you would chickens, basting liberally with 
butter. Season the gravy with a chopped shallot, and with 
summer savory ; add the giblets, and thicken with browned 
flour. 

Goose Pie. — An old goose stewed for five hours or 
more ; a smoked beef's tongue parboiled ; six hard-boiled 

eggs- 
Put on the goose in just cold water enough to cover it, 
and stew slowly and steadily, adding water, if needed, 
from the boiling kettle ; when cooked, cut all the meat 
from the bones ; lay the bones and skin aside, chop the 
giblets ; line a deep pudding-dish with good paste, lay in 



POULTRY. 149 

the pieces of goose, the chopped giblets, the sliced tongue 
and egg, in consecutive layers ; intersperse with strips of 
paste, season with pepper, salt, and bits of butter, and pro- 
ceed in this order until the dish is full ; add the gravy 
ill which the goose was stewed, thickened with browned 
flour; cover with thick paste, and brush the top with 
beaten white of egg. 

liocLst Pigeons. — ^Pick, draw, clean, and stuff as you 
would chickens ; lay them in rows, with a little water 
poured into the pan, to prevent their scorching. Unless 
they are very fat, baste with butter until they are half 
done, then with their own gravy. When cooked, thicken 
the gravy that drips from them, and boil up once, then 
pour into the gravy-boat. 

JSroUed Pigeons or Squabs, — Pick, clean, wash, and dry 
carefully with a clean cloth ; then split down the back, and 
broil like chickens ; season with pepper and salt, and but- 
ter liberally while dishing them. 

Pigeon Pie. — Clean, wash, truss, and stuff them ; loosen 
the joints with a knife, parboil them for ten minutes while 
you prepare a puff paste ; line a deep dish witli this, put 
in the bottom some shreds of lean ham, them some hard- 
boiled eggs, sliced, buttered, and peppered, then the birds 
sprinkled with pepper and minced parsley ; squeeze some 
lemon juice upon them, and lay upon the breast pieces of 
butter rolled in flour ; cover with slices of eggs, then with 
shred ham ; pour in some of the gravy in which the pigeons 
were parboiled, and cover with paste, leaving a hole in the 
lid ; bake an hour. This pie is best made of wild pigeons. 

Boned Pigeons. — Take four good-sized pigeons; draw; 
wash, and bone them, then fill with the following stuffing: 
One quarter of a pound of ham, one quarter of a pound 
of tongue, one half pound of chicken breast, or tlie white

meat of a chicken, two ounces of truffles, the yolk of two 
eggs, some bread crumb soaked in beef broth, a few drops of 
essence of celery, a teaspoouf ul of roasted powdered pareley, 
the grated rind of one quarter of a lemon, and a pinch 
of nutmeg; salt and pepper to taste; chop all the in- 
gredients finely, then mix well together and press through 
a colander; stuff the pigeons as full as possible; bind 
tliem firmly and securely with clean twine, and arrange 
them side by side in a stewpan, putting in a liberal lump 
of butter ; cover the stewpan closely, and let them cook 
over a slow fire for an hour. The cook should uncover 
the casserole from time to time, in order to see when the 
butter is absorbed, at which point some good broth should 
be added, in order to prevent the pigeons from burning. 
Serve cold. {Excellent) 

Stewed Duck. — Clean and divide as for fricassee. Put 
into a saucepan witli several slices of lean cold ham or 
salt pork, minced fine, and stew slowly, closely covered, for 
an hour; then stir in a large chopped onion, half a tea- 
spoonful of powdered sage, as much parsley, a tablespoonf ul 
of catsup, and black pepper; stew until tender, then add a 
teaspoonf ulof brown sugar, and a tablespoonf ul of browned 
flour, mixed with cold water; boil up once, and serve in a 
deep covered dish, with green pease as an accompaniment. 

Stewed Pigeons. — Pick, draw, clean, and stuff as for 
roasting. Put the pigeons into a deep pot with enough 
cold water to cover them, and stew gently for half an hour ; 
then put in a little ham cut into strips, and stew until, 
testing with a fork, you find them tender; then season 
with pepper, salt, a few blades of mace, a little sweet 
marjoram, and a good piece of butter; let them simmer 
for five minutes longer, then stir in a teaspoonful of 
browned flour; let it boil up once, then take out the 
pigeons, remove the strings, and put into a deep dish, 
pouring the hot gravy over them. 



POULTRY. 161 

Boast Turkey. — The turkey should be young and plump. 
It should be roasted on the spit, or before the fire in a 
roaster, and frequently basted. The body and craw should 
be stufEed tvith bread stuffing, or with equal quantities 
of boiled chestnuts and hara, chopped fine, and duly 
seasoned with butter, pepper, and salt, or with a bread 
stuffing mixed with lightly fried and finely chopped sau- 
sages. It should be basted frequently. The gravy must 
be made in a saucepan, from the drippings in the roaster, 
carefully skimming the fat. Chop up the liver as finely as 
•possible, and add it to the gravy. The time required for 
cooking must depend upon the size of the bird ; serve on 
a hot dish, with a wreath of water-cresses round it. Cran- 
berry sauce or jelly should always accompany roast turkey. 

Roast Turkey vnth Plum-Pudding Stuffing, — Prepare 
for roasting as above, and make a stuffing with bread 
crumbs, butter, salt, pepper, and an egg well beaten ; also 
a teacupful of large Malaga or Sultana raisins, carefully 
seeded; mix well, but do not wet the dressing; stuff the 
craw first, and sew it up ; then stuff the body of the turkey, 
leaving room for the raisins to swell. Roast as above 
directed. If the turkey is to be eaten cold, take out the 
dressing, moisten it with a little gravy, and serve it alone, 
"oery hot. 

, Wild Turkey should always be prepared with a chestnut 
stuffing, to which add much butter, as wild turkey is apt 
to be dry ; roast and baste as for domestic turkey, allowing 
one pound of good butter for basting a large wild turkey. 

Braised Turkey. — Truss a large turkey as for boiling ; 
stuff it with chestnuts, rolled bread crumbs, finely minced 
ham, and two or three truffles; add sweet herbs and onion 
to taste, and a little butter, as otherwise the dressing is apt 
to be too dry ; lard the breast of the turkey very delicately ; 
line the bottom of a braising-pan with slices of bacon and 



152 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

ham ; lay the tnrkey on these, and place more slices of 
bacon and ham on the top of it ; put in two carrots and 
two onions cut in slices, and sweet herbs, parsley, bay leaf, 
a clove of garlic, and whole pepper; salt to taste, and 
moisten with some good strong stock and a tumblerful of 
sherry ; lay a round of buttered paper on top, put on the 
lid, and braise with a moderate lire under and over for 
four hours ;. serve with the gravy strained, and freed from 
excess of fat 

Pressed Turkey in Jelly. — Take a large, tender turkey ; 
make a stuffing of bread crumbs, chopped pork fat, a 
minced onion, pepper, and salt ; stuff the craw and inside 
of the turkey as full as possible, and sew them up ; put it 
in a pot just large enough to hold it, with one pound of 
lean beef , shredded fine, two calves' feet, and salt to taste; 
let it simmer slowly for several hours, keeping the lid of 
the pot on, and adding boiling water, if the turkey should 
not continue covered ; when the turkey appears thoroughly 
cooked, take it off the fire, and put it away to cool ; let the 
stock cook until the meat falls from the bones of the 
calves' feet; then set it away to cool; in the morning re- 
move the fat, and put it (the stock) on the fire, in a kettle 
perfectly free from grease ; if the stock be not firmly jellied, 
add enough gelatine to stiffen it ; add also salt to taste, a 
tablespoonful of sugar, a blade of maccj and the whites 
of two or three eggs to clear it ; if the jelly is too light in 
color, add a little caramel coloring, and a few drops of 
lemon juice. Cut the turkey into small pieces, about two 
inches long ; have ready some cold smoked tongue or ham, 
minced fine, and mix this evenly with the stuffing; then 
pack the turkey in alternate layers of turkey and stuffing, 
in a tall, wide stone pot ; when all is in, pour the hot jelly 
slowly over it, allowing it to run well through the whole ; 
put the pot in a very cold place, and taki3 out the turkey 
when needed, after the jelly has become hard ; serve with 
capers or tiny pickled peppers. 



POULTRY. 153 

Tv/rhey aUa THestma. — Prepare the turkey as for 
roasting, and pnt it into a saucepan with some pieces of 
fat bacon, an onion, sliced, a carrot, and some celery, all 
chopped fine ; add also two calves' feet, a piece of but- 
ter, and the liver, etc., of the turkey; let all fry until of 
tk light brown color, then pour in enough broth to almost 
cover the turkey, and a liqueurglassful of the very finest 
old brandy ; cover the casserole hermetically, and let it cook 
over a slow fire until done; then serve in the sauce in 
which it has been cooked, which should be strained to free 
it from fat. A tablespoonful of tomato catsup is a great 
improvement to this sauce. It should be added just be- 
fore sending it to table. 

Jellied Turkey. — Take a large, fine turkey, pick, singe, 
draw, and clean it ; lard it with ham ; then wrap it com- 
pletely in thin slices of bacon and veal, and sprinkle oter 
it a little fried onion chopped fine, and several pieces of 
lemon freed from rind and seed ; place it in a casserole 
and pour in enough bouillon and white wine to almost 
cover it in the proportion of two thirds bouillon to one 
third white wine ; cover the casserole hermetically, if pos- 
sible, and cook over a slow fire for four hours; then piit 
tiie turkey on a dish and proceed to strain the broth in 
which it has cooked. If the broth should not be thick 
enough to jelly, return it to the fire for a few minuted; 
in order to clear it throw in the beaten white of an egg 
while the broth is cooling; then replace it on the fire, 
allow it to boil up once or twice, and strain it through a 
cloth; when it begins to cool pour it slowly and care- 
fully over the turkey, taking care to do this so evenly that 
the turkey may be thoroughly encased in the jelly ; serve 
cold, garnishing with crisp lettuce leaves and celery. 

Rodst Duck with Olives. — Prepare the duck as for 
roasting, and fill it completely with large Spanish olives 
carefully stoned ; then sew up the opening, ptit the duck 

7* 



154 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

on the spit, or in the oven, and roast as usual. If tender, 
the duck will not require more than an hour to roast It 
should be well basted. Roast duck with olives is gener- 
ally best cold. 

Boiled Turkey, — StuflE with a bread stuffing in the body 
and craw ; tie the legs and wings close to the body be- 
fore putting it into the pot; when the flesh begins to 
crack open about the legs it will be cooked enough ; serve 
with a rich oyster or equally rich celery sauce. 

^Imitation Boned Turkey,— rTake a large, fine turkey ; 
stuff the inside and craw with a rich forcemeat; take 
care to bind the legs and wings so tightly to the body as 
almost to imbed them in it, making the outside as nearly 
iis possible a plain surface ; simmer it gently until ten- 
der, in as little water as will cook it, turning it often ; 
have prepared a rich meat jelly, clear and well flavored; 
place the turkey, breast downwards, in a deep oval vessel, 
and pour the jelly over it; set it in a cold place; when 
quite cold, set the vessel an instant in hot water to turn 
out the jelly, then dish ; place some fragments of jellyion 
.the top, with a sprig of curled parsley. 

Boned Turkey.— Cut off the neck and claws, Tcmave 
the drumsticks, and leave the wings, which must be care- 
fully boned; then put the turkey on a clean cloth, cut 
open the back, and very carefully remove all the bones, 
taking care also not to spoil or gash the skin; then^with 
a larding needle, carefully lard the breast of the turkey 
and whatever other part admits of larding; make a stuff- 
ing of veal, fillet of beef, fat pork chopped into small 
dice, ,bread crumbs rolled fine and mixed with savory 
herbs, salt and pepper to taste, small triangular bits of 
cold tongue, a few truffles sliced fine, and yolks of two. or 
three hard-boiled eggs cut into thick slices; fill the inte^ 
fior of the turkey with alternate layerfl of this stuffing and 



POULTRY. 155 

the thinnest possible slices of cold veal and lean ham; 
when stuffed sew up the aperture carefully, and rub the 
turkey over with lemon juice; do this thoroughly, and 
then envelop the turkey in thin slices of ham; sew it 
up afterwards in a clean muslin cloth, which should previ- 
ously have been dipped in sherry wine ; cook it for three 
hours, proceeding as for turkey alia Triestina; when 
quite cold remove the cloth, and serve the turkey in the 
jelly in which it waa cooked. This jelly should be clari- 
fied. 

Devilled Turkey. — Take a cooked leg of turkey ; slash 
it to the bone ; salt and pepper it well, using botli black 
and cayenne; mix some made, mustard with flour, and 
plaster it over the leg; place it on a gridiron, and boil 
over a clear fire. 

Scalloped Turkey. — Butter a deep dish, line it with 
bread crumbs, and put in the bottom a layer of bread 
crumbs seasoned with butter, pepper, and salt, then a layer 
of cold turkey chopped fine, and so on until the dish is 
full, adding the stuffing and gravy of the turkey; then 
beat together two eggs, add to them two tablespoonf uls of 
milk, butter, salt, pepper, arid rolled cracker crumbs; 
spread thickly over the top of the turkey; bake half an 
hour, keeping it covered for twenty minutes, then remove 
the cover, and brown. 



GAME. 

See " General Directions " for Poultry, page 140. 

To Preserve Game Untainted. — Draw ; rinse thoroughly 
with soda and water, then with pure cold water; wipe 
dry; put in the cavity of each bird a piece of charcoal, 
and rub the birds lightly with fine salt and a very little 
black pepper. Hang in a cool, dark place with a clean 
cloth thrown over them. 

Reed or Oriolxms. — Pluck, but do not draw, thjse birds ; 
cover them with strips of lai-d, and roast on skewers. 

Gras Grojsses, — These little birds infest the prickly- 
ash trees in July and August, in the Southern States, 
and are killed by scores with mustard-seed shot; and 
are so fat that they often burst in falling to the ground. 
Pluck, but never draw them ; wrap each one in a vine leaf 
and roast on skewers. 

CaiUe de Lawrier, — These birds are considered the 
greatest delicacy in the South, where they fatten on 
the seed of the magnolia. Pluck and draw your birds, 
put a magnolia seed in each one, and roast on skewers. 
Cut slices of bread the same size, toast carefully, and 
place them in the dripping-pan under the birds. They re- 
quire only twenty minutes to cook. Serve each bird on a 
slice of the toasted bread. 

Wild Ducks (stewed). — Clean, draw, wash, wipe ; put 



GAME. 157 

in a raw carrot or ouion, and boil ten minutes. Then lay 
in very cold water half an hour; then cut up, pepper, 
salt, flour them, and fry to a light brown ; put them in ^ 
saucepan and cover with a gravy made of the giblets, 
necks, and some bits of lean veal ; add a minced shallot, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, salt, and pepper ; cover closely 
and stew until tender; take out the duck, skim and 
strain the gravy, return to the fire, and put in a cup of 
rich cream in which an egg has been beaten, thicken witli 
browned flour, add a tablespoonful of wine and the juice 
of half a lemon, beaten in gradually, boil up, and pour 
over the ducks. 

Wild-Pigeon Pi^.— Make . this precisely as you make 
quail pie, except that the pigeons are cut up and are not 
stuffed. The gravy should be much richer, made with 
strong stock and thickened by a lump of butter rolled in 
browned flour. 

Wild Ducks, (roasted). — ^Prepare as you prepare other 
game, and roast for half or three quarters of an liour, ac~ 
cording to size. 

Canvas-idck Ducks. — Canvas-back ducks must be roast- 
ed quickly, before a brisk fire, to keep the juices from 
flowing out ; from flfteen to thirty minutes is the range 
allowed to suit different tastes. They should never be 
stuffed or dressed in any way ; and are always eaten very 
much underdgne, so that a rich, high-colored blood will 
follow the knife. 

Sgruabs in Olives, — Clean them nicely and lay them in 
salt and water; take a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
quarter of an onion, three tablespoonfuls of flour, and a 
little mace, cloves, pepper, and salt, and stew all together 
for half an hour; then add the squabs, the olives stoned, 
and let all stew slowly for an hour longer. 



168 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Boast WUd Ducks. — Pluck and draw the dnck ; put in 
a little salt and two sage leaves. This imparts a delicious 
flavor. Koast on a spit, and baste with melted butter. 

Teal Ducks. — These are best broiled. Pluck, draw, and 
split down the back ; sprinkle with a little salt and pep- 
per ; broil over a quick fire, and serve with a little melted 
butter in which you have chopped parsley and a little 
lemon juice; pour this over at the last moment. 

Duck with Olives. — ^Pluck and draw your duck ; cook 
it in a saucepan with half butter and lard ; pour this out ; 
make a roi^ with a spoonful of flour and some fresh but- 
ter ; add some bouillon, salt, pepper, and a soup bunch ; 
return your duck, and when it is nearly done tlirow in 
some olives which you have stoned ; let them cook five 
minutes ; servo your duck surrounded by the olives ; skim 
the sauce, and serve in a sauce-boat. 

Broiled Game. — Clean, wash, and split down the back ; 
lay in cold water half an hour; wipe carefully; season 
with salt and pepper, and broil on a buttered gridiron over 
a clear, fierce fire ; when done lay in a hot dish, butter 
both sides well, and serve at once. 

Salmi of Game^ No. 1.— Put together for gravy all the 
dressing, skin, and odds and ends of your cold game ; put 
into a saucepan with a slice of ham, a minced shallot, and 
a bunch of sweet herbs; pour on a pint of strong broth^ 
and stew, closely covered, for almpst an hour; then skim 
and strain, return to the fire, thicken with browned flour, 
add B,soupgon of liutmeg, a little lemon juice, and a wine- 
glassful of burned sherry. Meanwhile the game must 
have been neatly cut up, and placed in another saucepan 
to heat ; pour over the sauce, heat snioking hot, dish, and 
serve. 



' GAME. 159 

SaJ/mi^ No. 2 (Gouff^. — Bone the ganie and chop the 
meat fine; then pound it in a mortar to a paste ;.wLen 
pounded to a smooth paste, moisten with a little bouillon ; 
when it is quite smooth, press the paste through a sieve. 
Meanwhile, heat in a casserole a little butter, the pieces of 
skin, dressing, the bones, etc., of the game; add a little 
strong broth, a tablespoonf ul of good red wine, two shal- 
lots, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; thicken with browned 
flour ; when it has cooked half an hour add two teaspoon- 
f Ills of olive-oil and the juice of a lemon ; boil up once, 
then strain ; meanwhile heat the paste ; wlien thoroughly 
heated place the paste oh croutons of fried bread, garnish 
with slices of lemon, pour over the sauce, and serve. If 
this salmi should be niade of partridge, it may be garnished 
in December with slices of bitter orange. 

Salmi^ Coldj of Goose or Duck. — This 5<zZmi should be 
prepared at table. Carve the bird nicely ; rub the liver 
and lights to a smooth paste ; add the cold gravy, two or 
three spoonfuls of olive-oil, the juice of a lemon, s^ltand 
pepper to taste ; work to a smooth dressing of the consist- 
ency of mayonnaise^ and serve with the cold game. 

Chaudfroid {Ouisiniire Parisienne). — Cnt up the cold 
game very carefully ; arrange it with equal care on a 
largej round dish, building up the cold game into a pyra- 
mid ; pour over all a rich sauce, which will jelly when 
cold. Aspic jelly, or clarified calves'-foot jelly, flavored 
with strong stock, are best for this. Garnish, when cold, 
with sliced lemon, curled lettuce, etc. 

Salmi Glace (or sauce cluxudfroid), — Make a good sauce 
vdoute; strain free from grease, and add a third of the 
quantity of aspic jelly ; put on the flre and boil until it 
thickens ; then renaove the saucepan from the fire, stir in 
the yolks of three eggs well beaten, strain, and set away 
to;cool;.when cool, and before it forms, spread it careful- 



160 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

]y over your pieces of cold game, being xjareful to cover 
or ice them completely ; when cold arrange in a dish, and 
garnish with pickled mushrooms. 

Game Pie. — It is well to make this of different kinds of 
game. Clean and wash the birds,.cutting the smaller ones 
in half, the larger into four pieces ; trim off the inferior 
portions of the birds, and put them into the saucepan with 
the giblets, and a pint and a half of broth for six birds. 
While this is stewing, make a good puff paste and line a 
large pudding-dish, reserving enough for a lid fully half 
an inch thick ; lard the breasts of the birds with tiny bits 
of salt pork, and make a forcemeat of the cooked livers, a 
couple of slices of pork, a bunch of parsley, sweet marjo- 
ram and thyme, the juice of a lemon, and a tiny shaUot; 
pepper and mix with rolled bread crumbs moistened with 
milk; put some thin strips of cold corned ham in the bot- 
tom of the pie, then some pieces of bird well buttered, 
then a layer of forcemeat, and so on until the dish is full ; 
then strain the gravy, return to the fire, pepper, and add 
a glassful of wine ; pour boiling hot into the pie ; put on 
the lid — cutting a hole in the middle — and bake three 
hours. 

Jugged Hare. — Cut the hare in pieces and lay in a stone 
jar ; grate a Spanish onion ; have ready a muslin bag with 
all kinds of seasoning — hot peppers, sage, thyme, and round 
peppers ; put all the blood in a pint-and-a-half basin, fill 
up with water, and mix as much flour with this as will 
make it the thickness of good cream ; put all into the jar, - 
adding Worcestershire sauce and salt, a wineglassf ul of 
port wine, a heaping tablespoonful of currant jelly, and 
half a lemon sliced fine ; put a plate on the mouth of the 
jar, and tie tightly down ; cook three hours d, hain-marie. 

Roast Ortolans (Brillat Savarin). — The art of knowing 
how to roast ortolans consists in the fact they must never 



GAME. 161 

be approached by salt ; this destroys their peculiarly deli- 
cate flavor. When they are picked, drawn, and cleaned — 
ready for roasting — they should be filled with fresh, un- 
salted butter; they should then be tied in small, thick 
slices of light, white bread (unsalted bread is best), and so 
arranged on the spit, roasting over a clear, though slow, 
fire. The cook should baste them continually with a lit- 
tle fresh butter, and later with their own dripping ; a few 
moments before serving the bread should be untied and 
placed in the dripping-pan, and the ortolans basted until 
they assume a delicate brown color ; they should be served 
with the bread in which they have been roasted. 

Partridge Pie. — Line a deep dish with puff paste ; put 
a layer of thin slices of ham at the bottom of the dish, and 
on this a layer of veal, chopped finely and passed through 
a sieve; then cut up four partridges ; season them lightly 
with salt, pepper, a little chopped parsley, and thyme; 
pour in a pint of very good gravy ; cover with puff paste, 
and bake an hour; glaze the upper crust with white of 

Roast Partridge. — Clean, truss, and stuff as you do 
chickens ; roast at a hot fire, and baste with butter and 
water until brown ; sprinkle with salt ; dredge lightly, at 
the last, with flour to froth the birds, and serve hot ; thick* 
en the gravy in the dripping-pan with browiied flour, boil 
up once, and serve in a boat. Cream sauce, ^o. 2, is de* 
licious with roast partridge. 

Broiled Partridge.— Clesin, wash, and split down the 

back ; lay in cold water half an hour ; wipe carefully, sea* 

son with salt and pepper, and broil on a buttered, gridiron 

. over a clear fire ; when done, lay on a hot dish, butter 

both sides well, and serve at once.

quarters; put them in a saucepan with a little lard, slice« 
of ham, and sausage; let them cook half done; blanch a 
fine, white-head cabbage in boiling salt and water ; drain 
and split in half ; cut out the heart of the cabbage, and 
stuff the cabbage with the partridge, ham, and sausage ; 
tie it up tightly together; line the bottom of a saucepan 
with slices of onions and strips of breakfast bacon or ham ; 
put your cabbage on this; cover your saucepan closely, 
and cook over a gentle fire till done; remove the strings 
from the cabbage ; serve with the sauce in which it has 
cooked poured over it. • 

Partridge with Chestnuts. — Pluck, draw, and singe 
your bird over a quick blaze ; lard it with fine strips of lard, 
seasoned with salt and pepper; put it in a saucepan witli 
a soup-bunch, strips of lard, a glassful of white wine, a glass^ 
fill of good bouillon and salt, and a little pepper ; cook slow- 
ly and take your bird out of the saucepan when done; 
strain your gravy ; have ready fifty good boiled chestr 
nuts, peeled; pound them in a mortar, moisten theirt 
with the gravy, pass them through a colander, serve your 
bird on the pu7'ee, always surrounded by fried croutons. 

S7iipe en Salmis, — Cut up any cold roast snipe; put 
them in a saucepan with the livers and entrails well chopped ; 
add chopped eschalots, a glassful of white wine, salt, and 
pepper ; let it boil a few minutes, take out the pieces of 
bird, lay them on toasted slices of bread on a dish, and 
pour the gravy over them and serve. 

Grilled Part7*idge,—DrsLW, clean, and wash the par- 
tridge ; wipe dry, and split and arrange for broiling ; put 
it into a deep dish which has been well rubbed with 
garlic ; sprinkle with salt and pepper, a little chopped 
parsley, a leaf or two of laurel, and some very fine olive- 
oil ; leave it there (the dish being well covered) for two 
or three hours; then broil on a buttered gridiron over 



GAME. 153 

a clear fire, turning often; serve on a very hot dish, 
squeeze a little lemon juice over it, surround with a 
wreath of water-cresses, dotted with slices of lemon. 

Partridge Breaded and Broiled. — Prepare as above, 
dip in beaten ^^^^ then in rolled bread crumbs ; broil as 
above, and serve with sauce ^m'orf^. 

Partridge or oiJier Cold Oame in Mayonnaise. — Cut 
up the cold game nicely, and place on a bed of mayon- 
naise sauce ; pour over some more mayonnaise^ so as to 
cover the game completely ; garnish with olives, truffles, 
pickled beets, curled lettuce, etc. 

Cold lamb is also very good so treated. 

Partridge or other Game with a Puree of Green Pease. 
— Stew the partridge and serve on 2i p^irie of green 
pease. 

Quail Pie. — Clean, truss, and stuff the birds, and loosen 
the joints without entirely separating them ; parboil them 
for ten minutes, meanwhile lining a deep dish with good 
puff paste ; put in the bottom some shreds of salt pork or 
ham ; next, a layer of hard-boiled eggs, buttered and pep- 
pered ; then the birds, sprinkled with pepper and minced 
pareley ; squeeze some lemon juice upon them, and lay 
on them pieces of butter rolled in flour; cover with slices 
of egg, then with shredded ham ; pour in some of the gravy 
in which the quail were boiled, and put on the lid, leaving 
a hole in the middle; bake over an hour. 

Boast Pheasant d le Brillat Savarin. — Let your bird 
hang unpicked until the odor determines its proper condi- 
tion for cooking. Pick and draw it ; lard it carefully with 
fine, firm strips of lard ; take two snipe, bone and draw 
them ; take the meat, make a stuffing with beef marrow, 
a little fat meat, salt and pepper, and enough truffles 



164 THE UNBIVALLED CXX)K-BOOK. 

chopped fine to fill the pheasant; stnfE yonr bird, and be 
caref al to cover the opening with a crnst of bread and tie 
it with a thread to keep it in place ; then take the entrails 
and livers of the snipe (throwing away the gizzards), 
pound them with two large truffles, an anchovy, a little fat 
meat, and fresh butter; prepare' a slice of bread large 
enough to extend two inches beyond the bird ; spread this 
paste evenly on the bread, which you place in the drip- 
ping-pan, under the bird, on the spit, and which receives 
all the drippings from the bird; when the pheasant is 
cooked, serve it on the slice of bread, surround it with 
slices of sour orange, and pour over it a wineglassful of 
good Burgundy. 

Boast Pheasant^ English Style. — When your bird has 
hung long enough, pluck, draw it, and envelop it in a 
strong, buttered paper and put it on the spit ; in half an 
hour remove the paper, to let it brown, and watch it care- 
fully to know when it is done ; baste it with melted butter, 
in which you have poured a spoonful of good Madeira ; 
cut and trim eight little slices of bread the same size; 
place them in the dripping-pan; serve your bird on a 
dish surrounded by these and alternate slices of lemon. It 
will require three quarters of an hour to cook the pheas- 
ant. 

Boast Pheojsamis* — When the pheasant is prepared for 
roasting it should be carefully larded and stuffed with 
bread crumbs, butter, a little ham minced fine, arid some 
boiled chestnuts, cut into quarters ; add also a little pow- 
dered parsley; then fold the pheasant in white paper 
carefully buttered, put it on the spit or in the oven, and, 
when almost cooked, remove the paper and brown the 
pheasant carefully ; serve with bread or cream sauce. 

Pheasant Stewed in Malaga Wine. — Lard the pheasant 
with ham, and stuff it with fillet of beef and boiled chest- 



GAME. K6 

nuts in eqnal proportions, adding also some bntter and 
chicken liver ; salt to taste ; then put the pheasant in a stew- 
pan with a few onions fried in batter, some slices of lean 
ham, and enough stock to almost cover it ; when about half 
cooked add a glassf nl of Malaga wine ; serve with the sauce 
in which it has been cooked, which should be strained 
to free it from fat, and thickened with some pounded 
boiled chestnuts. Truffles may be added with advan- 
tage. 

Roast Prairie Chicken. — Clean and truss your birds; 
lard one, and cover the other with strips of lard ; put a 
cherry or peach leaf in each bird, to improve the flavor ; 
roast on a spit. 

GhipdUxta of Prairie Chickens, — Out some fat pork in 
dice, and fry it till it begins to color ; set it aside ; make 
a rovx^ cut your bird in quarters, and put it in the roua^ 
with some bouillon, or water and white wine, mushrooms, 
the fried fat pork, and eschalottes (which have been fried 
in butter) ; take some sausages, divide each link in three 
by tying with a thread, heat them through on the gridiron, 
untie the thread, and remove the skin ; add to this some 
roasted chestnuts and a soup bunch ; cook all together ; 
skim, remove the soup bunch, and serve on a dish sur- 
rounded by fried croutons. 

Broiled Quail or Woodcock. — Split down the back, and 
broil oyer a clear fire ; bntter and salt when well done, and 
let them lie between hot plates before sending them to 
table. 

Small snipe or other birds are nice cooked in this way«^ 

QiuzHs, Ortolans J Sora, Reed Birds or Rail are good 
broiled or roasted. In Virginia the cooks usually roll an 
oyster in melted butter, then in pepper and salt, and put 
i.t into each bird before roasting, and baste with butter 



166 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

and water three times, and then with melted butter. They 
take usually twelve minutes to cook, and are served on 
toast prepared as above. 

lioaat Quails Larded. — Clean and draw the quails, and 
lard the breasts carefully with thin strips of fat pork; 
stuff with a rich forcemeat of bread crumbs prepared as 
for grouse ; sew up, truss, and roast on the spit or in the 
oven, basting with butter and water, and then with butter. 
Quails cooked in this way are delicious hot or cold. 

Stewed Hare or JSabhii d la Minute {Cuisinilre Pari- 
sietine). — Skin, clean, wash, and wipe a young hare ; cut 
into pieces and put into a pot with a little butter, salt, and 
spices to taste; stew to a fine brown, add mushrooms, 
shallots, parsley, all chopped fine, also a teaspoonful of

Hdbbits or Hares en PapiUotes {Ouisiniire Parisienne), 
— Take tender young hares or rabbits, skin, clean, wash, 
and, after cutting into small pieces, lay in salt water twen- 
ty minutes; then wipe dry, and put into a deep dish with 
a little chopped parsley, chives, mushrooms, and a tiny 
clove of garlic ; add, also, pepper and olive-oil ; leave the 
rabbits several hours in this savory bath ; then wrap each

and boil four eggs hard ; lay some bits of pork in a hot 
dish, and upon these a layer of rabbit ; upon this spread 
slices of hard-boiled eggs, peppered and buttered ; sprin- 
kle with a little powdered mace, and squeeze a few drops of 
lemon juice upon each piece of meat; proceed in this 
order until the dish is full, the last layer being pork ; 
pour in the gravy in which the rabbits were cooked; 
cover with puff paste, cut a slit in the middle, and bake 
one hour, laying paper over the top lest it brown too 
fast. 

Barbecued Rahbit (Daddy Jim's). — Take fat and tender 
rabbits; skin, clean, split open, and cut off the heads; then 
lay in salted water for three quarters of an hour, perhaps 
a little less ; wipe dry very carefully, gash the backbone 
across and across, then broil on a buttered gridiron over a 
clear, fierce fire, turning the rabbit often ; when brown 
and tender lay on a very hot dish, pepper and salt, and 
then butter profusely, turning the rabbit over and over to 
soak up the butter ; cover, and set in the. oven for five min- 
utes, while you heat two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, sea- 
soned with one of made mustard ; moisten the hot rabbit 
well with this, cover, and send to table garnished with 
crisped parsley and slices of lemon. 

Eagout of Rabbit (Daddy Jim's). — Skin, clean, and cut 
up a fine, large rabbit ; put four ounces of fresh butter and

hour and a quarter; stir it from time to time to keep it 
from sticking to the saucepan; take a pint of little white 
onions, cook them in butter a few moments till they begin 
to color; moisten them with a little bouillon ; add a little 
dash of sugar to glaze them, and set them aside to serve

around yonr ragont; while your rabbit is cooking, peel 
and slice a quart of field mushrooms, and when the rabbit 
is nearly done add these to the ragout ; take out the on- 
ion and soup bunch ; taste to see if it is seasoned enough ; 
dress your rabbit on a dish, pour over it the sauce, and 
garnish your dish with the glazed onions. 

Our old Daddy Jim believed in stirring in at the last 
moment the rabbit's blood with little pieces of butter; 
add this and stir continually, and it gives the gravy more 
consistency. 

Broiled HdfMt — Skin and clean your rabbit ; split it 
lengthwise; flatten it with the rolling-pin; wrap it in a

tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of sheriy, and 
thicken with browned flour ; boil up once, and serve with 
the rabbit. 

Babhits or Hares, — They are unfit for eating in the 
early spring. All rabbits should, after being cleaned, lie 
m salt and water for an hour before cooking. 

Purie of Snipe d la Oriole (Madame Eugdne). — Snipe 
should always be kept /<?«/• daySy at least, before cooking.

them in a cool, dry place. Take a dozen snipe, pluck 
them and draw them ; cut off all the meat, and put it 
aside, with the entrails, in a mortar ; put the remains of 
the birds in a saucepan with bouillon, parsley, laurel leaf, 
a clove, and two glassf uls of white wine ; boil this till it 
is redu(5ed to half, and strain it ; pound your birds and en- 
trails in a mortar with three ounces of fat pork, moisten 
with the above sauce, and pass this puree through a col- 
ander ; put it in a saucepan, let it heat through without

frequently from the bottom ; then add the tomatoes and 
sugar and stew for an hour longer ; ten minutes before tak- 
ing the pot from the fire put in the butter rolled in browned 
flour; give a final boil, and turn into the soup tureen. 

Eoast Birds with Hasty Pudding d la Verona. — Clean 
and truss the birds, put a small bit of fresh butter in each, 
and arrange them in rows, putting a piece of bacon and a 
sprig of laurel between each ; then put them on the spit, 
having first rubbed them over with butter; baste with 
butter and water, and as soon as they begin to brown put 
into the dripping-pan some thick squares of cold hasty,

but do not draw the birds, and put the toast under them, 
as soon as they begin to cook, to catch the trail. 

Boast Woodcock^ No. 2. — Clean, draw, truss, and stiiflE 
with a rich forcemeat of bread crumbs peppered and salt- 
ed, shortened with melted butter, and moistened with 
cream; sew. them up and roast, basting with butter and 
water, from twenty minutes to half an hour ; when half 
done put under them slices of toast prepared as above, and 
serve with the woodcock.

brown color, fine in grain, and fat. 

Boast Haunch. — ^Wash off the outside with lukewarm 
water ; then rub all over with fresh butter ; cover with a 
thick paste of flour and water, then with white paper well 
buttered, then with thick foolscap ; bind firmly with pack- 
thread ; then pass on the spit and roast, allowing five hours 
if the haunch be large, and the fire steady and strong ; 
baste constantly with butter and water, at intervals, to pre- 
vent scorching ; half an hour before you take it up remove 
the papers and paste and test the haunch with a skewer ; 
if the skewer passes easily to the bone through the thick- 
est part, set the haunch down to a more moderate fire, and 



172 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

baste every few minutes with claret wine and melted but-

then skim, strain, and put on the fire again in a clean 
saucepan ; add three tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, a 
glassful of claret, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and thick- 
en with browned flour ; dish in a gravy-boat. 

Serve currant or grape jelly with venison.

tracting the bones on the under side; stuflE with a fine 
mince of fat mutton, bread crumbs, butter, and seiasoned 
with a little nutmeg, allspice, salt, cayenne pepper, and 
wine ; bind firmly with broad tape ; baste once with melt- 
ed butter; then put in a saucepan with a pint of venison

place on a hot dish, strain the gravj, and pour over the 
meat. 

Venison OuUets.'^These are usually cut from venison 
which is not fat or juicy enough for roasting. They 
should be carefully trimmed and larded with fat pork; 
then lay them in a stewpan with a few pieces of young 
onion on each; scatter, also, a little minced parsley and 
thyme between the layers of meat, and pepper and nut- 
meg to taste;, no salt, as the pork will salt sufficiently; 
pour over all a plain venison gravy — that is, a gravy made 
as above, but without wine, lemon, currant jelly, or but- 
ter ; cover closely and cqok twenty minutes ; then take up 
and fry in just enough butter to keep them from burning ; 
fry quickly, turning the cutlets constantly; then put into 
a hot chafing-dish and pour over them the gravy in which 
they have been cooked after you have strained it and 
added a tablespoonf ul of currant jelly, a teaspoonf ul of 
Worcestershire sauce, half a glassful of port wine, and a 
little browned flour for thickening ; boil up once and pour 
over the cutlets ; cover, and let them stand fifteen minutes 
before sending them to table. 

Ragout of Gold Venison, — Put the bones, fat, and scraps 
of cold venison on to stew, with a teacupful of cold water, 
a button onion minced fine, parsley and thyme, pepper and 
salt, three or four whole cloves, and a little mace ; stew for 
an hour, then strain and return to the saucepan, adding 
some cold gravy from the roast, a tablespoonf ul of currant 
jelly, one of mushroom catsup, a teaspoonf ul of Worces- 
tershire sauce, and a little browned flour; boil for three 
minutes, lay in the venison, cut into small squares, and 
heat, but do not boil, for three minutes ; stir frequently, 
and serve in a deep covered dish. 

Roast Fawn, — Clean, wash thoroughly, and stuff with 
a rich forcemeat made of chopped pork, bread crumbs, 



174 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

pepper and salt, a little grated nutmeg, and the jnice of a 
lemon ; moisten with water and cream ; bind with beaten 
egg and melted butter; sew up the fawn when stuffed, 
turning the legs under and binding close to the body ; cov- 
er with thin slices of pork bound on with packthread, cross- 
ing in every direction ; roast at a quick fire, allowing twen- 
ty-two minutes to a pound ; twenty minutes before serv- 
ing remove the pork and allow the fawn to brown, basting 
with melted butter; at the last dredge with flour, let this 
brown, froth with butter, and serve ; garnish with water- 
cresses or curled parsley, and serve with currant or grape 
jelly. 

Kids, hares, or rabbits may be roasted in the same 
way. 

Venison Ham. — Rub the hams with equal parts of salt 
and brown sugar ; then pack the hams into a cask, sprink- 
ling dry salt between them, and let them lie eight days, 
rubbing them daily with the salt and sugar ; then take the 
hams out of the pickle, brush them over with cider vine- 
gar, and afterwards with equal parts of fine salt, molasses, 
and a teaspoonf ul of saltpetre to every two hams ; empty 
the cask, wash it out with cold water, and repack the 
hams while damp and sticky, scattering fine salt over each. 
Let them lie in this pickle eight days longer; then wash 
off with tepid water, afterwards with vinegar ; then, while 
wet, powder them with bran, and smoke a fortnight or 
three weeks (if the hams are large) ; wrap in brown paper 
that has no unpleasant odor, stitch a muslin cover over 
this, and whitewash ; chip or shave for tlie table. 

Venison Sausages (" Common-Sense in the Household "). 
— Five pounds of lean venison ; two pounds of salt pork ; 
five teaspoonfuls of powdered sage ; four teaspoonf uls of 
salt ; four teaspoonfuls of black pepper ; two teaspoonfuls 
of cayenne ; one small onion ; the juice of one lemon. 

Chop the meat very small, season, and pack in skins or 



GAME. 1)5 

small stone jars ; keep in a cool, dry place ; fry as you do 
other sausages. 

Venison Pasty, — For the gravy, put the bones, fat, rag- 
lijed and gristly bits of venison into a saucepan with sweet 
I jerbs, celery, a shallot, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; cover well 
with cold water and set on to boil ; cut the better pieces 
of meat into squares (inch), and cook in another saucepan, 
until three quarters done; lino a large, deep dish with 
good puff paste; put in the squares of venison with half a 
cupful of the liquor in which the meat was stewed ; sea- 
son with pepper, salt, and butter, and cover with a lid of 
prepared pastry an inch thick ; cut a round hole in the 
middle, fit in a tin cylinder, and bake steadily, covering 
the crast with clean white paper as soon as it is firm; 
while it is cooking prepare the gravy. When all the sub- 
stance has been extracted from the bones, etc., strain the 
gravy, return to the saucepan, let it come to a boil, skim 
carefully, and add a glassful of port wine, a tablespoonful 
of butter, the juice of a lemon, and some browned flour to 
thicken ; boil up once, remove the plug from the hole in 
the pastry, and pour in through a funnel as much gravy 
as the pie will hold ; do this quickly, brush the crust over 
with beaten egg, and put the pie back in the oven until it 
is a rich golden russet. This operation should be rapidly 
performed, and at the door of the oven, or the crust will 
be spoiled. Bake two or three hours, guiding yourself by 
the size of the pie ; it is good hot or cold. 

CrvM for Venison Pasty. — One and a half pounds of 
sifted flour; twelve ounces of butter; three eggs; salt; 
ice- water. 

Dry the flour, and cut up half the butter in it with a 
chopper until the whole is fine and yellow ; salt, and work 
up with ice-water, adding, last of all, the eggs beaten very 
light ; work out rapidly, bundling as little as possible, roll 
out three times very thin, basting with butter, then into a 



176 THE UNIUVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

lid nearly an inch thick ; cover the pie with this ; cut the 
rest of the pastry irito figures and ornaments, bake on a 
tin plate, and glaze with beaten egg; when the pie is 
baked, cover the hole in the centre with one of these or- 
naments, and arrange the others on the crust. 

Yenison Steaks with Sauce. — Steaks are cut from the 
neck or haunch. Broil rapidly on a buttered gridiron over 
a clear and fierce fire, turning constantly. They require 
three or four minutes longer to cook than beefsteaks. 
While the steaks are broiling, prepare in a chafing-dish a 
sauce in the following proportions : A piece of butter the 
size of an egg for every pound of venison ; one tablespoon- 
ful of currant jelly for every pound of venison ; a pinch 
of salt, and the same of pepper ; a glassful of port wine or 
claret for every four pounds. 

This should be liquid and boiling hot by the time the 
steaks are done to a turn ; lay each steak in the sauce 
separately, and turn over and over; then cover closely 
and heat altogether, with the lamp burning underneath, 
for five minutes; serve in the chafing-dish. 

Venison Steaksy Plain. — Broil as above, then dust with 
pepper and salt; place on a very hot disll with a lump of 
butter on each steak ; cover with another hot ^lish and 
leave in a warm place for five minutes; then turn them 
over two or three times in the gravy which runs from 
them, and serve. 

Venison Chops are cut from the loin and neck ; broil and 
l)utter as above. 

Wild Turkey. — Draw and wasli the inside very careful- 
ly, wipe dry, and hang for twelve hours before roasting; 
when ready to roast wipe dry again, truss, and stuff with 
a rich forcemeat of bread crumbs, some bits of fat pork 
chopped fine, pepper, a soupqon of lean minced ham, and 



GAaiE. 177 

some boiled and peeled chestnuts ; moisten with milk, and 
beat in an egg and two or three tablespoonf uls of melted 
butter ; baste with butter and water at first, then three or 
four times with gravy, then five or six times with melted 
butter. It is safe to allow at least three quartei's of a 
pound of butter for basting a large wild turkey. Dredge 
with flour at the last, froth with butter, and serve when 
the turkey is finely browned ; dish on a very hot dish, sur- 
round with a wreath of water-cresses or curled parsley, and 
have ready cranberry, currant jelly, and 2^ puree of chest- 
nuts, so that your guests may have a choice of sauces. 

Quails Boasted with Ham. — Clean, truss, and stuflE as 
usual; but cover the bird with ham or pork cut in thin 
slices, binding all with buttered packthread ; then envelop 
all in buttered white paper, and baste well with butter and 
water ; roast three quarters of an hour if the fire is good, 
basting constantly; remove the papers and meat at the 
last, and brown quickly.

VEGETABLES. 

GENEBAL RULES FOB COOKING VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables should invariably be fresh. They should 
always be well picked over, and examined before using. 
The time required for boiling green vegetables is from thirty 
to forty minutes. 

Green vegetables should always be put on in hot water ; 
potatoes in cold water. 

Dried vegetables, pease, beans, okra, etc., should be soaked 
all night before using them. Beets require from two to 
three hours to boil, turnips an hour, cabbage an hour and 
a half, parsnips three quarters of an hour, carrots two or 
three hours, onions one. 

Tomatoes can scarcely be too much cooked. Okra 
should always be boiled whole. All vegetables should be 
carefully cooked, drained, seasoned, and served red-hot. 



Artichokes^ Fried. — Pull off the very outer leaves, cut 
off the stalk, and clean the artichokes thoroughly, then cut 
into small pieces, dip in beaten white of egg, roll in bread 
crumbs, and fry a light brown. 

Artichokes^ Boiled, — Clean the artichokes thoroughly, 
cut off the stalk, and pull off the outer leaves ; then put 
them in a casserole with enough water to cover them, 
and a pinch of salt ; a tablespoonful of essence of spinach 
had better be added some ten minutes before they are 
taken from the fire. This will preserve their green color. 



VEGETABLES. 179 

When cooked, drain, and arrange in a very hot dish ; 
serve with bread sauce, sance HoUandaiae^ or sauce Soubise, 

Fricasseed Artichokea, — Prepare the artichokes as for 
frying, boil; when tender, throw them into cold water for 
a few moments, and then stew in a rich white sauce, with 
some cold boiled chicken, cut into pieces an inch square. 

Truffled Artichokes d, la Verona. — Prepare as for stuffed 
artichokes, substituting sliced truffles and rolled bread 
crumbs for any other stuffing ; moisten well with melted 
butter, then with strong soup stock, and cook as stuffed 
artichokes ; when about to serve, add a glassful of sherry to 
the gravy. 

Artichokes y Farcis demi JBarigoule {Cuisiniire Pari- 
sienne). — Prepare as for stuffed artichokes, but put a hand- 
ful of chopped mushrooms in the stuffing, and as great a 
variety as possible of sweet herbs, chopped fine ; put them 
in a saucepan with a large lump of butter for fifteen 
minutes, then take them out and put them into a rich 
white sauce ; cook with fire above and below, basting the 
artichokes often with their sauce. 

Artichokes d la Provenqale {Cuisiniire JBourgeoise). — 
Prepare the artichokes carefully, and parboil ; then arrange 
in a large flat dish, with two or three cloves of garlic, salt, 
pepper, and enough olive-oil to moisten them thoroughly ; 
put the dish on the coals, and cook with fire below and 
above; when they are cooked, take out the garlic, squeeze 
over them the juice of a lemon, and serve. 

Stuffed Artichokes. — Reserve the very large artichokes, 
and boil them ; take out several of the inner rows of the 
scales, cut off the tender portions of these, and chop them 
fine, with a tablespoonf ul of fresh meat, the same of ham 
or pork, and a tablespoonf ul of bread crumbs; season the 



180 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

mixture with pepper and salt, moisten it with a little gravy, 
and add a piece of onion as large as a nutmeg, mashed to 
a pulp ; fill the middle of the artichokes with this stuffing, 
set them in a pan, with a little rich gravy or broth at the 
bottom ; cover it well, and let them stew slowly for an hour. 

Boiled Jerusalem Artichokes. — Wash and scrape the ar- 
tichokes, and boil them in water; then add salt, and boil 
them in milk until quite soft; stir in a lump of butter, 
well rolled in flour, a tablespoonf ul of rich cream ; season 
with black pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg. 

Baked Jerusalem Artichokes, — Boil one pint of arti- 
chokes in water for fifteen minutes, and then in milk ; 
mash them smooth; mix in them a dessertspoonful of 
butter, a pint of bread crumbs, pepper and salt; bake in 
open shells, with bread crumbs on top. 

Broiled Articlwkes {Caisinih*e Bourgeoise). — Parboil 
the artichokes; pull off the leaves; chop the eatable parts 
fine with a little parsley, chives, rolled bread crumbs, salt, 
pepper, mushroom powder, a spoonful of the finest olive- 
oil ; put this stuffing back on the artichokes, fold in a fine 
folding wire broiler, well buttered, and broil over a clear, 
fierce fire. 

Asparagus^ Boiled. — Cut your stalks of equal length, 
rejecting the woody or lower portions, and scraping the 
white part which remains ; throw into cold water as you 
scrape them ; tie in a bunch with soft strings, muslin, or 
tape, and put into boiling water, slightly salted ; if very 
young and fresh, it is well to tie in a piece of coarse net 
to protect the tops; boil from twenty to forty minutes, 
according to the age; just before it is done, toast two or 
three slices of bread, cutting off the crust; dip in the 
asparagus liquor, butter, and lay in a hot dish ; when 
you take off the asparagus, drain, unbind the bundle, and 



VEGETABLES. 181 

heap it upon the toast, with bits of butter between the 
stalks. 

Asparagus and Eggs. — Cnt twenty-five or thirty heads 
of asparagus into bits half an inch long, and boil fifteen 
minutes ; have a cupful of rich drawn butter in a sauce- 
pan, and put in the asparagus when you have drained it 
dry ; heat together to a boil, seasoning with pepper and 
salt, and pour into a buttered bake-dish ; break five or six 
eggs carefully over the surface, put a bit of butter upon 
each, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and put in when the 
eggs are set. 

Or, you may beat the eggs — ^yolks and whites separately 
— to a froth ; season with butter, pepper, and salt ; stir 
them together, with the addition of three tablespoonfuls 
of milk or cream, and pour evenly over the asparagus 
mixture in the dish ; this is decidedly the better way of 
the two, although somewhat more troublesome. 

Aspara^gus in Ainhvsh. — Cut off the tender tops of fifty 
heads of asparagus ; boil and drain them ; have ready half 
a dozen (or more) stale biscuits or rolls, from which you 
have cut a neat top slice, and scraped out the crumb ; set 
tliem in the oven to crisp, laying the tops beside them, 
that the cavities may be well dried; meanwhile, put into 
a saucepan a sugarless custard made of a pint — if you need 
so much — of milk, and four well-whipped eggs ; boil the 
milk first, before beating in the eggs ; set over the fire and 
stir until it thickens, when add a large spoonful of butter, 
a little salt and pepper, and lastly the asparagus tops, minced 
fine ; do not let it boil, but take from the fire so soon as 
• the asparagus is fairly in ; fill the rolls with the mixture, 
put on the tops, fitting them accurately ; set in the oven 
three minutes, and arrange on a dish, to be eaten hot; 
the number of rolls will depend upon their size; it is 
better to have them small, so that one can be served to 
each person. 



182 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Beets Boiled. — Wash, boil several hours, or until tender; 
then pare, and cut them into slices (if very small leave 
them whole) ; put them into a hot dish, pepper and salt 
lightly, and butter abundantly. 

Beets Stewedy No. 1.— Boil and pare, and, if necessary, 
slice as above ; then put into a saucepan witlv a little vine- 
gar and water, a lump of butter, some pepper and salt, 
and a spoonful of catsup; let them simmer slowly for 
some time. 

Beets Stewed^ No. 2. — Boil, skin, and slice as above; 
then put into a saucepan with a minced shallot and some 
parsley, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, the same 
quantity of vinegar, salt and pepper ; then set on the fire 
and simmer twenty minutes^ stirring often ; serve in their 
gravy. 

Beets in Vinegar. — Boilj skin, and slice as above; put 
into a deep dish, pour over vinegar enough to cover them ; 
dust with salt, cover, and leave until cold. 

String^ or French^ Beans^ No. 1. — Break off tops and 
bottoms, and string very carefully ; then pare both edges 
with a sharp knife, lay the beans in salted cold water for 
twenty minutes, drain, and put into a saucepan of boiling 
water; boil quickly — twenty minutes if well-grown, less 
if small — but remember that the beans must be tender; 
drain off the water, put into a hot dish, stir in a liberal 
lump of butter, squeeze over the beans the juice of a 
lemon, and serve. 

String Beans^ No. 2. — Prepare as above, then put them 
on the fire in cold water slightly salted, and boil until very 
tender ; drain off the water, return to the fire in a dry 
saucepan, add a large lump of butter, a little white pepper, 



VEGETABLES. 183 

a large spoonful of cream, and let tbein stew gently an 
hour or two before serving; no vegetable, except perhaps 
tomatoes, is so much improved by long and slow cooking 
as string beans. 

Lima Beans. — Only the young ones should bo used ; 
lay them in cold water for an hour and a half after they 
are shelled; then boil them until quite tender; drain 
them well, and season with a little white pepper and salt ; 
add a large piece of butter after the beans are dished, and 
toss them until the bntter is melted. 

Kidney and other Small Beans. — Shell into cold water, 
and cook in boiling water until tender. A small piece of 
fat bacon boiled with them is an advantage to nearly all 
beans. If the bacon be used, the beans should not be salted. 

Dried Beans. — Wash well, and soak over-night in luke- 
warm water, changing it several times for warmer ; boil 
two hours ; add a spoonful of burned sugar, then mash 
thoroughly, working in a large lump of butter. 

Bacon and Cabbage. — This, I need hardly say, is a fa- 
vorite country dish at the South. The old-fashioned way 
of preparing it was to boil meat and cabbage together, and 
serve, reeking with fat, the cabbage in quarters, soaking 
yet more of the essence from the ham or middling about 
which it lay. In this shape it justly earned a reputation 
for grossness and indigestibility that banished it, in time, 
from many tables. Yet it is a savory and not unwhole- 
some article of food in winter, if the cabbage be boiled in 
two waters, the second being the "pot-liquor" from the 
boiling meat ; drain thoroughly in a collander, pressing 
out every drop of water that will flow, without breaking 
the tender leaves, and, when the meat is dished, lay the 
cabbage neatly about it^ and upon eacli quarter a slice

of hard-boiled ogg ; wbcQ yon eat^ season witli pepper, 
salt, and vinegar. 

Stuffed Cabbagey & la CrMe, — Clioose for this purpose 
a largejfirm cabbage ; take oflE the onter leaves, and lay in 
boiling water ten minutes, then in very cold ; do this 
several hours before you are ready to stuff it; when per- 
fectly cold, bind a broad tape about it, or a strip of muslin, 
that it may not fall apart when the stalk is taken out ■ re- 
move this with a thin, sharp knife, leaving a hole about as 
deep as your middle finger; without widening the mouth 
of the aperture, excavate the centre until you have room 
for four or five tablespoonfnls of the forcemeat — more, if 
the head be large ; chop the bits you take oiit very small; 
mix with same minced cold boiled pork or liani, or cooked 
eausage-meat, a very little onion, pepper, salt, a pinch of 
thyme, and some bread crumbs; fill tlie cavity with this, 
bind a wide strip of muslia over the hole in the top, and 
lay the cabbage in a large saucepan with a pint of " pot- 
liquor" from boiled beef or ham; stew getitly UDtil very 
tender ; take out the cabbage, unbind carefully, and lay in 
a dish ; keep hot while you add to the gravy, when you 
have strained it, pepper, a piece of butter rolled in flour, 
and two or three tablespoon fuls of rich milk or cream ; boil 
op, and pour over the cabbage. 

^^Gollards^^ or Cahhage Sprouts. — Pick over carefully; 
lay in cold water, slightly salted, half an hour; shake in a 
colander to drain, and put into boiling water, keeping at 
a fast boil until tender, A piece of pork seasons them 
pleasantly- In this ease put the meat on first, adding the 
greens when it is parboiled, and cooking thcin together. 
Boil in an uncovered vessel. Drain, chop, and heap them 
in a dish, laying the meat on top.

der, drain and set aside until perfectly cold ; chop fine, and 
add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, 
salt, three tablespoon fuls of rich milk or cream ; stir all 
well together, and bake in a buttered pudding-dish until 
brown ; eat very hot. I can recommend this dish even to 
those who are not fond of any of the ordinary prepara- 
tions of cabbage. It is digestible and palatable, resem- 
bling cauliflower in taste. 

Fried Cdblage. — Chop cold boiled cabbage, and drain 
very dry, stirring in a little melted butter, pepper, and 
salt with three or four tablespoonfuls of cream ; heat all in 
a buttered frying-pan, stirring until smoking hot ; then let 
the mixture stand just long enough to brown slightly on 
the under side. It is improved by the addition of a couple 
of beaten eggs. Turn out by putting a flat dish above the 
pan, upside down, and reversing the latter. Tins is a 
breakfast-dish. 

Boiled Cabbage. — Pick ofE the outer green leaves, quar- 
ter, examine carefully to be sure there are no insects in it, 
and lay for an hour in cold water ; then put into a pot 
with plenty of boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes; 
change the water, filling the pot with boiling water from 
the kettle; cook until tender all through. Three quarters 
of an hour will do for a good-sized cabbage when young. 
Late in the season you must be guided by the tenderness 
of the stalk. Drain well, chop, and stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, pepper, and salt; serve very hot. If you 
boil corned beef or pork to eat with cabbage, let the 
second water be taken from the pot in which this is cook- 
ing; it will flavor it nicely. Always boil cabbage in 
two waters. 

Sauerkraut — Shred or chop the cabbage fine; line a 
barrel, keg, or jar with cabbage-leaves on tlie bottom and 
sides ; put in a layer of the cut cabbage, three inches in

of salt and shred eabbage, repeating the pounding every 
four or five layers until the vessel is full ; cover with 
leaves, and put the board on the top of these with a heavy 
weight to keep it down ; set all away to ferment; in three 
weeks remove the scum, and, if need be, cover with wa- 
ter ; keep in a cool, dry cellar. It can be eaten raw or 
boiledj and seasoned with pork. 

Boiled Oaulijloieer. —Pick off the leaves and cut the 
stalk close to the bottom of tfie bunch of flowers; lay in 
eold water for half an hour ; unless very large do not cut 
it; if you do, quarter it neatly; tie a close net of coarse 
bobbin ed lace or tarlatan about it to prevent breaking or 
bruising; put into boiling water, salted, and cook until 
tender ; undo and remove the net, and lay the cauli- 
flower in a hot dish ; have ready a large cupful of drawn 
butter and pour over it; cut with a silver knife and fork 
in helping it, serving the sauce to each person ; take it 
out of the water as soon Us it is done^ and eat hot; it 
darkens with standing,

eupfnl of milk thickened with a very little rice or wheat 
flour, and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, pepper, 
and salt; shake the saucepan over the fire gently until it 
boils; take out the cauliflower with a perforated skimmer, 
lay in order upon a dish, and pour the sauce over them*

Scalloped Cauliflower, — Boil until tender, clip into neat 
clusters, and pack — the stems downward — in a buttered 
pudding-dish; beat up a cupful of bread-crumbs to a soft 
paste, with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and three 
of cream or milk ; season with pepper and salt, bind with 
a beaten egg, and with this cover the cauliflower; cover 
the dish closely, and bake six minutes in a quick oven ; 
brown five more, and serve very hot in the dish in which 
they were baked. 

Broccoli and Brussds Sprouts, — Pick over, wash care- 
fully, cut off the lower part of the stems, and lay in cold wa- 
ter, slightly salted, half an hour; cook quickly in boiling 
water, with a little salt, until tender; this will be in twelve 
or fifteen minutes ; cook in an uncovered saucepan ; drain 
well, lay in a meat-pile lightly heaped in the centre of a 
dish, and pour drawn butter over them, or serve this in a 
tureen. 

Broccoli and Eggs, — Boil two or three heads of broc- 
coli until tender; have ready two cupfuls of butter drawn 
in the usual way, and beat into it, while hot, four well- 
whipped eggs; lay buttered toast in the bottom of a hot 
dish, and on this the largest head of broccoli, whole, as a 
centre-piece; arrange close about this the others, cut into 
clusters, the stems downward, and pour the egg sauoo 
over all. 

Cauliflxywer a la Heine, — Boil a cauliflower in salted 
water till tender, but not overdone; when cold, cut it up 
neatly in small sprigs; make a dressing of three table- 
spoonfuls of oil and one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, 
-with pepper and salt to taste; rub a dish slightly with 
garlic, arrange the pieces of cauliflower on it; strew over 
them some capers, a little tarragon, chervil, parsley, all 
fairly minced, and a soupqonoi dried thyme and marjoram, 
powdered ; pour the dressing over it, and serve.

Cauliflower au Graiin, — Boil a cauliflower in salted 
water till tender ; then put into a dish, cut it up neatly, 
arranging the pieces of stalk so as to form a foundation ; 
sprinkle these with grated and browned bread crumbs and 
grated cheese, and a little white pepper ; then upon thin 
fonndation arrange the flowery part of tlie cauliflower, 
sprinkling them thickly with grated {not browned) bread 
crumbs, grated cheese, and a little white pepper ; stick bits 
of butter over the top, then set in the oven until brown; 
serve in same dish. 

Carrots^ Stewed^ No. 1. — Scrape, peel, and wash the car- 
rots, and boil until perfectly soft, with one or two onions. 
Carrots require a long time to cook. When quite soft, 
cut them in small pieces, put into a saucepan with a little 
meat gravy or soup stock, and let them simmer for an 
hour or longer, with pepper, salt, vinegar (very little), and 
a pinch of white sugar. If you have no soup stock or 
gravy, use butter, browned flour, and water, for the sauce.

Carrots^ Stewed^ No. 2. — Prepare as above, but omit 
the vinegar; use cream for the sauce, and dust the dish 
lightly with roasted powdered parsley. 

Mashed Carrots, — Boil as above ; then mash soft with 
a wooden beetle and work in butter, pepper, salt, and a 
spoonful of rich cream. 

Baked Cucumbers, — Pare the cucumbers, chop them 
fine, with a small onion ; put them on with a very little 
water, and let them stew for ten minutes; prepare a rich 
dressing as for poultry ; pour off all the water from the 
cucumbers, add the dressing and one tablespoonf ul of but- 
ter, and bake in a deep dish. 

Fried Cucwiibers, — Slice the cucumbers when the seeds 
arc full-grown, and before they turn yellow or ripen ;

fry them as fish, with hot butter or lard. 

Fried Cucumbers d VIMienne. — Cut the cucumbei-s 
with a potato-cutter iuto fine, thin strings ; throw them 
into ice-water for an hour; then dry them, drop into hot 
lard, and fry as yon do Saratoga potatoes ; dust with pep- 
per and salt, and serve. 

Baked Cucumbersy Stuffed. — Cut fine, large cucumbers 
lengthwise ; scoop out a hollow in them ; stuff with a rich 
forcemeat of bread crumbs, cold veal or chicken mincefd 
fine, salt and pepper to taste, and enough melted butter to 
bind all smoothly together ; stuff the cucumbera with this, 
and bake them in a slow oven. 

Stewed Cucumbers. — Pare them, and cut into thick 
slices; put them into a saucepan, with a minced shallot 
and a little water, and let them stew for fifteen minutes ; 
pour off the water,. stir in a little flour, butter, salt, and 
pepper; let it remain on the fire two or three minutes, and 
serve. 

Raw Cucumbers. — Pare, cut into the thinnest possible 
slices, and lay in ice-water, slightly salted, for two hours ; 
drain, put into a dish which has been rubbed with onion 
or garlic, and serve with a simple French dressing. A 
pinch of cayenne usually improves raw cucumbers. You 
may omit the oil in the dressing if you like. 

Stewed Salsify. — Scrape and wash well six or eight 
roots, and boil them until they are quite soft; then cut 
them in pieces an inch long, or less ; mix a piece of butter 
the size of an Qg^ with flour, very smoothly ; add two or 
tliree tablespoonfuls of milk, and stir it into the saucepan 
with the salsify, seasoning it with salt and pepper; stir 
frequently, and let it stew gently half an hour.

er, stir in a great lump of batter, and in five minutes 
serve. 

Sweet Com as Prepared by the Indians, — Boil as many 
ears as you require of the sweet corn, such as is used for 
the table, and of the same degree of ripeness. It should 
not be boiled quite as long as for present use. Cut the 
grains from the cob, and spread them on large cloths in 
the sun and dry thoroughly ; keep in a dry room ; when 
wanted throw a few handfuls into a pot of boiling water, 
and boil till soft. This, in midwinter, will give a dish of 
corn as fine as if plucked from the field. 

Hulled Com (Indian receipt). — Boil ripe corn in weak 
lye until the hulls come off easily ; then wash it well and 
put it in fresh water, and boil it till it is well swelled ; 
then wash it again and boil it in water (in which you have

Fried Egg-pUmt. — Oat the egg-plants into slices at least 
a quarter of an inch thick ; salt them and let them lie on 
a dish a little raised on one side that the juice may ran 
off; let them remain thus for an hoar; then flonr them, 
add more pepper and salt, and fry brown on both sides. 
Egg-plant may also be dressed like salsify. 

Scalloped Egg-plant. — Quarter, peel, and boil the egg- 
plant until soft enough to mash ; drain, mash, add a large 
cupful of bread crumbs soaked in cream, a lump of butter 
the size of an egg, a pinch of chopped parsley, a little on- 
ion chopped fine, and pepper and salt to taste ; mix all

rolled bread crumbs, and bake twenty minutes. 

Stuff ed Eggplants cL la Creole. — ^Parboil the egg-plants ; 
cut them in halves ; scoop out the inside, being careful not 
to break the outside skin, which you refill later with the 
following stufling : Mix up the inside of the egg-plant with 
a slice of boiled ham chopped very fine, bread crumbs, but- 
ter, salt, and pepper — shrimps, if you have them, make a de- 
licious addition ; bind this stuffing with the yolk of an eg^^ 
and fill your egg-plant skins ; sprinkle with powdered bread 
crumbs, put a small lump of butter on each piece, and 
bake. 

Stuffed Squash. — Parboil the squash ; cut a round piece 
out of the top, remove the seed, make a stuffing as above, 
and fill your squash and bake. 

JBell Peppers can also be stuffed and served in the same 
manner.

enough cold water to cover the hominy eight or ten inch- 
es deep. 

Boil an hour, pour off all the water, and fill the pot in 



VEGETABLES. 193 

the same measure with boiling water ; boil for nine or ten 
hours steadily, refilling the pot with boiling water as it 
boils away; do not 'stir nor uncover the pot; when ten- 
der uncover and move it where it will only simmer, un- 
til the water is absorbed; then drain dry; serve very hot, 
with butter, pepper, and salt. 

To Boil SmaU Hominy. — One quart of hominy ; two'

hot and well greased ; then put in the homifiy, cover the 
pan closely with a plate, and set it where it will not 
burn; when the honiiny is thoroughly heated through, 
remove the cover, and let it brown on the bottom and 
sides. 

Lettuce au Jus (Cuisinikre Bourgeoise), — Take firm, 
apple-shaped lettuce, and pull off the loose green leaves ; 
wash and blanch ten minutes in boiling water, then drain 
and press dry lightly with a clean cloth ; make a small in- 
cision in the heart of each lettuce, and put in some bread 
crumbs soaked in strong stock, a tiny dice of fat bacon, a 
little pepper, and a sowpqon of nutmeg ; bind the lettuce 
firmly in shape with strong thread ; then line a deep sauce- 
pan with slices of fat bacon, carrots, onions, and a bunch 
of sweet herbs ; place the lettuce in the bottom of the 
saucepan, cover thera with slices of bacon and vegetables, 
moisten well with beef bouillon and strong gravy, stew 
two hours, and serve with the- sauce in which they have 
been cooked thickened with browned flour. 

Lettuce d la Crtmeor d, la Chartreuse, — Proceed as above, 
omitting the bacon and soup stock, and using instead but- 
ter and cream.

with croutons (cruBts) of fried bread. You may omit the 
stock and cook simply in milk if you like. 

Stewed Chiccory, — Prepare as above. 

Mules for Cooking Mushrooms, — Select always the f I'esh- 
cst and finest. They should be round, small, firjn, the 
under side salmon or pink, the outside grayish white, with 
pink gills- No other sort of mushroom is safe. Cook 
in a porcelain -lined saucepan, always cooking a peeled 
white onion in the pot. Should the onion turn black, the 
mushrooms are unsafe. If you do not like the flavor of 
the onion, put a silver spoon into the pot and leave it while 
you cook the mushrooms; if it should tarnish the mush- 
rooms are unsafe. Pick over the mushrooms carefully, 
wash, and wipe with a flannel cloth. 

Stewed Mushrooms^ No. 1. — ^Wash and peel the mush- 
rooms, sprinkle salt over them^ and let them stand a short 
time ; to a pint of juice add a small teacupf ul of milk, and 
stew them for nearly an hour ; if they do not give out much 
juic^j add a little more milk to prevent them from drying ; 
when: stewed add a lump of butter the size of an egg, 
a little salt, red and black pepper, and a spoonful of rich 
cream.

beef or chicken broth (or even water) instead of milk, and 
adding a small teacupful of sherry when you put in the 
butter.

a little piece of butter; keep them covered all the time, 
and serve hot. 

ScaUoped Mushrooms, — Choose for this purpose fine, 
firm ones. Pick, wash, wipe, and peel as usual ; then lay 
them in a deep pudding-dish well buttered ; season them 
with pepper and salt and a very little onion ; sprinkle each 
layer with rolled bread crumbs, dot with little pieces of 
butter, and proceed in this way until the dish is full, hav- 
ing the top layer of bread crumbs; bake in a moderate oven. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — Take large, fine mushrooms; 
pick, wash, wipe, and peel them ; take oflE the stems, and 
boil them in a little cream or milk; place the mushrooms 
in a fine folding wire broiler; place this over the coals and 
turn it frequently, removing the mushrooms as they are 
done to a hot, covered dish. : . . . 

Mushrooms^ Steamedy No. 1 (Soyer).-^Cut two slices of 
bread half an inch thick, and large enough to cover the bot- 
tom of a plate ; cut ofE the crust; toast them a light brown on 
both sides, and spread some Devonshire cream {i, ^., sweet, 
rich cream, clotted); then, having previously cleaned the 
mushrooms, put them head downward on the toast, sprin- 
kle them lightly with salt and white pepper, and place in 
each mushroom as much clotted cream as it will hold; 
then put a small tumbler or cup over each muslirbom, 
pushing it well down into the toast ; put the mushrooms 
so prepared into the oven and cook fifteen minutes; when 
you remove them from the oven do not remove the glass 
for several minutes. This is incompiarably the best way 
of cooking mushrooms. The inverted glass condenses the 
peculiar aroma which is the glory of the mushroom. 

Mushrooms^ Steamed^ No. 2 (Soyer). — Proceed as above ; 
but if you have no clotted cream, make a sauce in the fol- 
Ipwing manner: Boil some milk until it is reduced to

cream, with a little salt, pepper, and one clove ; when 
warm put in an ounce of butter mixed with a little flour; 
stir well ; put the mushrooms on the toast with this sauce, 
cover with a basin, and place in the oven for half an hour. 
All kinds of mushrooms are delicious in this way. 

Mvshroom8 d la Russe. — Clioose tlie finest button 
mushrooms yon caji get ; wipe clean and white with a wet 
flannel cloth, and cut off the stalks ; stew ten minutes in a 
porcelain saucepan ; strain partially, and cover with as 
much rich sour cream as you have water; stew five min- 
utes, and add some veal gravy and a very little lemon 
juice, and salt and red pepper to taste. They should be 
pretty hot. 

MtishroomLoaf, — Carefully wash the mushrooms, wip- 
ing them dry and white with a flannel cloth; put into a 
porcelain saucepan, together with a sliced onion and a 
Jittle pepper and salt ; cover with cold broth, and stew 
very gently for fifteen minutes; then add a tablespoonful 
of butter, divided into bits and rolled in browned flour; 
boil three or four minutes; then add three tablespoonfuls 
of white wine beaten up with egg, and stir two minutes 
more ; have ready a baker's well-baked, stale loaf, from the 
inside of which all the crumb has been removed. This 
must be done in the following manner: Make around hole 
in the bottom of the loaf and carefully dig out as much 
of the crumb as possible, while keeping the shape of the 
loaf; now stuff the hollowed loaf with the mushrooms, 
lidding, also, the bread crumbs, moistened with the sauce 
in which the mushrooms were cooked ; when the loaf is 
filled, stop up the hole with a piece of bread, and put the 
loaf in a casserole, the bottom of which must be covered 
with slices of ham ; add all the mushroom sauce and bread 
crumb which remain, and, after basting the loaf carefully 
with melted butter, cook it with fire below and above, and 
.until it is thoroughly heated through and finely browned;

baate once again with butter, and serve in a very hot 
dish. (Delicious,) 

Mushroom Toast. — Stew some mushrooms as above, 
substituting water for the broth, and cream for the white 
wine; have ready some muffins, each sliced in four, light- 
ly toasted and buttered on both sides, and arrange tlie 
mushrooms in layere between the slices^of toast; pour over 
them some boiling milk, with wliich the sauce in which 
the mushrooms were cooked has been stirred; cover close- 
ly for five minutes before serving. 

Roast MushroomSy No. 1. — Clean and wipe the mush- 
rooms, and arrange them on buttered toast, and with a little 
butter in the hollow of each, in a Dutch oven ; sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, dredge very lightly with flour, and 
turn from time to time. 

Roast Mushrooms^ Ko. 2. — Choose some mushrooms 
and prepare as for "Mushroom Loaf;" but some time 
before using them put them to soak in a little melted but- 
ter with a soujpqon of garlic; then skewer them carefully, 
and roast over a clear, fierce fire, basting occasionally with 
butter; meanwhile, boil the stems in a little broth, and, 
when the mushrooms are cooked, transfer to a very hot 
dish, cover, and strain the gravy, adding salt and pepper, 
a lump of butter, and a wineglassful of sherry ; pour 
over the mushrooms, and serve, 

Baked Mushrooms, — Choose fine mushrooms, prepare 
as usual; put them to soak for an hour in a little cream, 
with a shallot; then envelop each mushroom closely in 
buttered white paper, and bake in a moderate oven; salt 
and pepper them, and serve. 

Nettles and Dandelions^ gathered before they are in 
flower, may be dressed like spinach and served on toast or 



VEGETABLES. 199 

garnished with pieces of fried bread, and are a wholesome 
addition to the list of vegetables. 

Nettles or Sop Tops, served as Asparagus (excellent). — 
Break off the young shoots of hops, tie them in bundles, 
and boil them with a little meat for twenty minutes; serve 
as asparagus. 

Boiled Onions. — Cut off tops and tails, and skin them; 
lay in cold water half an hour; then put into a saucepan 
with enough boiling water to cover them ; cook fifteen 
minutes and drain off the water, re-covering them with 
more from the boiling kettle; boil until a straw will 
pierce them; drain and put into a dish with pepper, salt, 
and plenty of butter; serve with the drawn butter in a 
butter-boat. Never cook onions in an iron pot. 

Stewed Onions. — Young onions should always be cooked 
in this way: Top, tail, and skin, them ; lay them in cold 
water half an hour or more, then put into a saucepan 
with hot water enough to cover them ; when half done, 
throw off all the water except a small teacupful — less, if 
your m^ss is small ; add a like quantity of milk, a large 
spoonful of butter, with pepper and salt to taste; stew 
gently until tender, and turn into a deep dish. 

If the onions are strong and large, boil in three waters, 
throwing away all of the first and second, and reserving a 
very little of the third to mix with the milk. 

It ought to be more generally known that the disagree- 
able odor left by any Si the onion family upon the breath 
may be removed by chewing and swallowing a few grains 
of roasted coffee. No more nutritious vegetable ever finds 
its way to our tables; and it is greatly to be regretted that 
the unpleasant result just named should deter so many 
from eating it. It is especially beneficial to brain-workers 
and nervous invalids — the very people who are least likely 
to use it 



200 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Baked Onions, — The large Spanish or Bermnda onions 
are the only kinds which are usually baked. Wash clean, 
bnt do not remove the skins; boil an hour. The water 
should be boiling when they are put in, and slightly salt. 
Change it twice during this time, always replenishing with 
more boiling-hot water, and simmer in the oven for an 
hour, basting often with melted butter; when done, take 
the onions up carefully and arrange the open ends upper- 
most in a vegetable dish; add to the gravy in the dripping- 
pan the juice of half a lemon, four tablespoon fuls of cream 
or milk, and a little browned flour wet with cold milk ; 
boil up once, and pour over the onions. 

Stuffed Onions, — Wash and skin very large Bermuda 
onions; lay in cold water an hour; parboil in boiling wa- 
ter half an hour; drain, and while hot extract the hearts, 
taking care not to break the outer layers ; chop the inside 
thiis obtained very fine, with a little cold fat or bacon ; 
add bread crnml)s, pepper, salt, mace, and wet with a 
spoonful or two of cream ; bind with a well-beaten ^g'g^ 
and work into a smooth paste ; stuff the onions with this ; 
put into a dripping-pan with a very little hot water; turn 
off the water; take the onions out and lay upon a cloth, 
that all the moisture may be absorbed or evaporate ; roll 
each in a round piece of buttered tissue-paper, twisting in 
at the top to keep it closed, and bake in a slow oven near- 
ly an hour; when tender all through, peel them, put them 
into a deep dish, and brown slightly, basting with butter 
freely ; this will take, perhaps, a quarter of an hour more ; 
serve in a vegetable dish, and pour over the melted but- 
ter when you have sprinkled with pepper and salt. 

Pea Fritters or Cakes, — Cook a pint or three cups more 
pease than you need for dinner ; masli while hot with a 
wooden spoon, seasoning with pepper, salt, and butter; 
put by until morning; make a batter of two whipped 
eggs, a cupful of milk, quarter teaspoonf ul soda, half a tea- 



VEGETABLES. 201 

spoonful of cream of tartar, and half a cup of flour; stir 
the pea mixture into this, beating very hard, and cook as 
you would ordinary griddle-cakes. 

Green Pease. — Shell and lay in cold water until you are 
ready to cook them; put into salted boiling water, and 
cook from twenty minutes to half an hour ; if young and 
fresh, the shorter time will suffice ; if just gathered from 
your own vines and tender, season only with salt. Market 
pease are greiatly improved by the addition of a small lump 
of white sugar. It improves taste and color. The English 
always put it in, also a sprig of mint, to be removed when 
the pease are dished. Drain well, and dish with a great 
lump of butter stirred in, and a little pepper ; keep hot. 

Buttered Parsnips. — ^Boil until tender, scrape, and cut 
lengthwise a quarter of an inch thick; broiLon a well- 
buttered gridiron, over a clear fire, turning them often ; 
when sufficiently cooked, transfer to a very hot dish ; but- 
ter well, turning tliem over and over ; pour over a little 
boiling-hot cream, and serve. 

Fried Parsnips.^— ^o\\ until tender, scrape off the skin, 
and cut lengthwise in thick slices ; dredge with flour, and 
fry in hot dripping, turning often ; drain off the fat, pep- 
per lightly, and serve. 

Boiled Parsnips.— H young, scrape ; if old, pare care- 
fully; put into slightly salted boiling water, and boil until 
tender ; test by piercing with a fork ; when tender, drain 
and cut lengthwise, butter well, salt and pepper, and serve. 

Parsnip Pritters.— Boil two large parsnips ; mash them 
well into a batter made of one tablespoonf ul of rolled 
bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of milk, and one egg; 
season it with salt and pepper; drop a tablespoonf ul at a 
time into boiling lard, and fry a light brown.

202 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Mashed Parsnips. — Boil nntil very tender, mash to a 
smooth cream, add a himp of butter, pepper and salt to 
taste, and two spoonfuls of cream ; shape into a mound, 
and serve. 

Potaioes^ to Cook. — " There are great varieties of pota- 
toes, and as many ways of cooking them, but toiling is 
always better than steaming ^^ (Meg Dods). — "Steam, or 
else boil until half done; then throw in salt and cold 
water ; boil till nearly done ; pour off the water, and leave 
the potatoes in thepot^ and as near the fire aspossible^^ (Mrs. 
Rundell). — " Boil in as little water as possible, without 
burning the saucepan " (Mrs. Glasse). — " Peel the pota- 
toes, and boil them slowly ; when done, pour off the water, 
throw salt over, and shake the pot violently for some 
time, so that they are brokem " (Mrs. Acton, " Lancashire 
Cookery "). 

Potatoes, io Choose. — First, remember that the smaller 
the eye the better the potato ; secondly, nip a piece from 
the thickest end with your finger-nail ; if good, the inside 
will be of a white, yellow, or reddish hue, according to the 
quality ; if spotted, though ever so slightly, the potatoes 
are bad. In the spring of the year potatoes are always 
bad, as the old ones are deteriorating, and the new ones are 
flavorless and watery. 

Potatoes, to Boil. — The various methods of boiling given 
by the above ancient authorities — Meg Dods, Mistresses 
Glasse, Rundell, and Acton — are all good, but different 
varieties of potatoes require different methods of boiling. 

New Potatoes are much better if thrown into very hot 
water, with a little salt, and boiled quickly — from fifteen 
to twenty minutes. 

Watery Potatoes should be peeled and thrown into boiU 



VEGETABLES. 203 

ing water ; when done, the water should be poured oflf, 
and some salt thrown over the potatoes, which should bo 
left in the pot near the fire, and shaken violently from 
time to time. If so watery by nature that this does not 
succeed, the potatoes should be washed clean, and put into 
the pot in their skins ; the pot should then be filled up 
with water, and a piece of lime, the size of a nut, thrown 
in ; this will render the potatoes mealy. 

Boiled Potatoes^ in their Skins, — Choose them of uni- 
form size, with a smooth skin, and boil in cold water, with 
a pinch of salt; cook steadily, until the skins begin to 
crack, and you can with a fork pierce them to the heart ; 
pour off all the watpr, sprinkle them with salt, and leave 
them uncovered near the fire for about five minutes ; serve 
in a very hot dish. 

Boiled Potatoes, without the Skin, — Pare as thinly as 
possible, lay in cold water for half an hour; then drop 
them in boiling water, slightly salted, and keep at a rapid 
boil until tender; drain off the water and salt, and dry as 
above directed. 

Poast Potatoes, — It is impossible to roast potatoes oth- 
erwise than with the aid of a wood fire. They should be 
washed clean, wiped dry, and buried in hot ashes and cin- 
ders. When thoroughly cooked they should be carefully 
wiped clean with a clean cloth, and served in their jackets, 
in a very hot dish. Eat with salt and butter. 

Soyer^s Roast Potatoes, — Take large, fine potatoes, par- 
boil them, remove the skins, and put them into a deep 
dish which has previously been well buttered, and lightly 
dredged with sifted flour ; stick bits of butter among the 
potatoes, dredge them with flour, salt, and pepper, and 
cook them hefore the fire in a Dutch oven ; when properly 
cooked they are light brown in color, and are delicious. 



204 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Tliey may also be cooked in the oven, but they are not so 
good. 

Baked Potatoes, — Wash and wipe some large ripe pota- 
toes, and bake in a quick oven until tender; i. e,y from 
three quarters of an hour to an hour, if the potatoes are 
large; press each potato until it cracks, in a clean cloth, 
and serve in a folded napkin, on a very hot dish ; eat with 
salt and butter. 

Desiree^s Potatoes (Creole method of making poor po- 
tatoes palatable). — Wash the potatoes, wipe them dry, peel, 
and carefully cut out all the bad parts; boil them accord- 
ing to the receipt for treating watery potatoes, and drain, 
salt, and dry ; shake them carefully until they are a mealy, 
dry mass; then take a clean, coarse, dry pudding-cloth, 
and, putting a double-handf nl of potatoes in it, wring the 
cloth until the potato is quite dry; place on a hot dish, 
and proceed in this way until the potatoes are thus formed 
into a pile of apparently large, fine, whole, mealy pota- 
toes. 

Stewed Potatoes^ xoith Cream, — Pare and boil the pota- 
toes, and set them away to cool ; cut each potato, when 
cold, into six or eight pieces ; make a sauce of half a pint, 
equal parts, cream and milk, a piece of butter the size of 
an egg, and plenty of sauce ; white pepper to taste ; -boil 
the sauce with a little dash of flour in it, and stew the po- 
tatoes for a quarter of an hour; just before removing the 
stewpan from the fire, stir in two more tablespoonfuls of 
cream. 

. Potatoes d la Maitre WH^td, — Cut cold boiled potatoes 
into small round pieces, and stew as above, omitting the 
cream and flour, and using a larger piece of butter;, lise 
also black pepper instead of white; just before removing 
the stewpan from the Are sprinkle; some. parsley aver the

4)0tatoes; boil np once, and serve on a very hot dish; 
squeeze the juice of a lemon over the potatoes before 
sending them to table. 

Curled Potatoes (Mary Anne's). — Wash, boil, drain and 
dry as for " D&ir^e's Potatoes," and press through a per- 
forated tin. Tl)6y are very good, and look like a delicate 
sort of vermicelli. Excellent with fish. 

Soyeif^s Sausage Potatoes. — Take lai'ge, fine potatoes, 
wash, wipe dry, but do not peel ; cut off the tops, and with 
a scoop cut ont a round piece as big as a shilling through 
the potato; insert into this a. small, %A% fried sausage ; 
put the tops on the potatoes, arrange them carefully in a 
deep dish with the cut. part uppermost, and bake in a 
quick oven; serve in the dish in which they have been 
cooked; piu a napkin rotind the dish. ' . : 

Stuffed Potatoes. — Take large, fair potatoes, peel, wipe 
dry, and scoop out as much as possible. of the inside; stuff 
them with any meat or fowl, chopped fine, flavored with 
a very little onion and moistened with butter; replace the 
tops on the potatoes, arrange th^m in a deep dish, and 
serve. 

Stuffed Potatoes^ No. 2 (" Common-Sense in the House- 
hold"). — Take large, fair potatoes, bake until soft, and cut 
a round piece off the top of each ; scrape out the inside 
carefully, so as not to injure the skin, and set aside the emp- 
ty cases with their covers ; wiash the inside carefully, work- 
ing into it, while hot, some batter and cream ; season with 
8:ilt, pepper, and a good pinch of grated cheese for each ; 
work it soft with cream, and put it into a saucepan to 
heat, stirring to prevent burning ; when scalding hot stir 
in one well-beaten egg for six large potatoes; boil up once, 
fill the skins with the mixture, replacing the caps; return 
them to the oven for three minutes ; arrange on a napkin

in a deep disb, caps uppermost ; cover with a fold of the 
napkin, and eat hot 

Browned Potatoes^ with Dripping. — Peel and parboil 
some good potatoes, drain dry, prick in several places, 
dredge well with flour, and (after having first skimmed 
the fat off) arrange them in the dripping-pan and cook 
them three quarters of an hour, under the beef ; bake and 
turn them often, and, when quite brown, drain on a wire 
sieve or on paper, and serve hot. 

Potato Marbles. — ^Potato marbles are shaped with the lit- 
tle instrument made for such purposes, and to be bought at 
all kitchen-furnishing shops. Cut the marbles, throw them 
into salt and water, and let them remain all night ; parboil 
them, drop them into boiling lard, and fry them a light 
brown ; dust lightly with roasted parsley before serving. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel the potatoes, slice them with a 
coleslaw cutter, and throw them into ice-water ; let them 
lie in it several hours, even for a night, and wipe quite 
dry ; have ready a skillet, with boiling lard quite deep in 
it ; throw the potatoes in, and they will brown quickly ; 
lift them out with a perforated skimmer, and drain on a 
dish spread with soft paper. 

Potato Balls — Duchesses. — Take half a dozen potatoes, 
boil them, pass them through a sieve, and work into them, 
in a bowl, one gill of cream and the yolks of three eggs; 
add pepper, salt, a sowpqon of nutmeg, and some parsley, 
finely grated; when they are well mixed and smooth, 
mould them into perfectly round balls, flour them, and fry 
them in hot lard or butter, rolling them continually so 
that they may be evenly browned; drain, and serve on a 
folded napkin. 

Potato Souffle is made according to the foregoing re- 
ceipt, beating the whites and yolks of the eggs separately,

tli€ latter to the stiflEest possible froth ; when all the in- 
gredients are mixed, beat very light, pour into a buttered 
mould, sprinkling the top with rolled bread crumbs and a 
saupqon of cheese ; bake instantly in a quick oven. 

Tossed Potatoes (Mary Anne's). — Chop some cold boiled 
potatoes line, and put them into a frying-pan with a little 
fat of cold beef also chopped fine ; add pepper and salt to 
taste ; stir and toss the potatoes about continually, some- 
times taking the pan from the fire and shaking it ; cook 
quickly, and do not cease tossing the potatoes for a mo- 
ment; when nicely browned, servo on a very hot dish. 
They will be found delicious. 

, Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Cut some cold boiled potatoes into 
small square blocks ; shred half an onion finely ; drop po- 
tatoes and onion into boiling lard and fry a liglit brown ; 
drain on paper and serve in a very hot dish ; dust with 
powdered parsley before serving. 

Potatoes with Ham. — Boil some potatoes, slice them 
quite thin, put them in a pan with a good-sized piece of 
butter, and let them heat thoroughly, but not fry ; boil 
four eggs hard and chop them fine, and chop fine about 
as much cold boiled ham as there is of potato ; put all into 
a dish in layers, with a little salt, parsley, and chopped 
onion on each layer ; pour over the whole four large cup- 
fuls of cream ; cover the top with bread crambs, dot the 
bread crumbs with small bits of butter, and bake a light 
browr. 

Potato Scallops. — Boil some potatoes, slice them fine, 
and heat as above ; put them into scallop shells which have 
been previously buttered and dusted with bread crumbs ; 
fill the scallop shells only half full of potato, then add 
some egg and cream beaten up together ; sprinkle the top 
with bread crumbs, and bake in a quick oven. 



208 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Fried Potatoes^ No. 1. — Pare the potatoes raw, and 
cut them lengthwise into slices; cut these again into thin 
strips; lay in ice- water for half an hour; drain, dry thor- 
oughly,, and drop into boiling lard; when brown put them 
into a colander and set it in a hot oven to drain ; serve 
hot. 

Fried Potatoes^ Ho. 2. — Chop cold boiled potatoes 
into bits, season with pepper and salt, and fry lightly in 
dripping or butter, turning them constantly until nicely 
browned. 

Piquant Potatoes ci la Bavilre {¥v^\\ von P. zu P.). — 
Slice some cold boiled potatoes very thinly ; then beat up 
in a bowl sonie verynoXx sweet or sour cream, adding just 
enough French mustard to give it a piquant taste; then 
take a wide, deep dish, butter it carefully, and lay a layer 
of the potatoes on tlie bottom; stick little bits of butter 
thickly on the top of this layer, then put a layer of slices 
of hard-boiled egg^ then more potato, and so on until 
the dish is full; each layer must be sprinkled with salt 
and dotted with little bits of "butter, also moistened suiS- 
ciently with cream; proceed in this way until the dish is 
full ; then pour in the remainder of the cream, dust the 
top lightly with bread crumbs, and heat in the oven ; serve 
with a napkin pinned round the dish. 

Potato Cakes, No. 1. — Mash as above directed, form 
(when cold) the potato into small round cakes (size of a 
tumbler), flour well, and bake on a buttered pan in a quick

small knife round and round in one continuous curling 
strip; drop into boiling lard or clarified drippings, drain, 
and arrange neatly on a hot dish. 

Potato Hay (German receipt). — Prepare as above and 
lay in ice-water; then with a potato-cutter cut the potato 
into small, fine, thin snips or straws; fry as above di- 
rected. 

Mashed Potatoes (Soyer). — Boil potatoes until mealy, 
rub off the skins, remove the specks, put them into a bowl,, 
and take two forks in one hand with the points of the 
prongs turned outward ; break the potatoes with them ; 
while breaking add butter and milk — an ounce of butter, 
and a gill of milk to every dozen potatoes ; salt and 
white pepper to taste. The potatoes should be beaten 
a great deal until quite light; they should never be 
hard like paste, as is the case if they are stirred with a 
spoon. 

Mashed Potatoes^ Browned^ No. 1. — Proceed as above, 
form into a mound, and set in the oven until brown ; glaze 
with butter, and serve.

til Scooted; wipe clean, aiKi serve on a folded napkin in a 
liot dish. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes. — ^Wash, wipe dry, and place them 
on the shelf of the ^ange oven ; watch them, and from time 
to time turn them that they may cook mealy ; when done, 
which can be told by squeezing them, take them from the 
oven and keep them in a hot place until ready to serve ; 
serve in their skins on a folded napkin ; eat with salt and 
butter. 

Sweet Potatoes^ Fried. — Pare the potatoes raw and cut 
them lengthwise in slices ; have a pot of boiling lard ready, 
into which drop the slices ; have ready a colander, and dry 
th« potatoes in it in a hot oven. 

Broiled Sweet Potatoes. — Parboil, cut lengthwise into 
slices a quarter of an inch thick, and broil on a buttered 
gridiron over a clear fire ; serve on a hot dish, salt the po- 
tatoes lightly, and dot them with bits of butter. 

Sweet Potatoes with Cream. — Wash them well, scrape or 
pare, and if very large cut them in two lengthwise; drop 
into boiling water ; when boiled drain, dry, and shake ; 
when quite dry season as follows : For six persons put in 
a piece of butter the size of a hen's egg, a pinch of salt, 
a little white pepper, a tablespoonful of sugar sprinkled 
evenly over them, and half a cupful of good, sweet cream ; 
cover tightly, and let them stand on the fire about five 
ininutes before serving. 

South Carolina Mode of Boiling Bice. — ^Wash the rice 
in cold water, pick it well, and let it lie in cold water un- 
til you are ready to cook it ; then pour the water off, and 
sprinkle the rice into a saucepan of boiling water slightly 
salted ; boil it steadily for twenty minutes, then take it 
off the fire and drain all the water from it ; place the sauce- 



VEGETABLES. 211 

!j)an, With the lid partly oflf, on a corner of the fire, where 
it is only moderately warm, to allow the rice to "soak" or 
dry. The moisture will pass off, and each grain of rice, 
swelled and bnrat open, will stand alone. When served 
the grains will fall apart if shaken. This is the only 
method of preparing rice to be eaten as a vegetable. 

Eice Croquettes. — Boil about half a pound of rice in a 
quart of milk; when it is thick and stiff take it off the 
iiix3, add two ounces of butter and the yolks of four eggs; 
set it away until it is cold enough to form into oval balls; 
dip them into yolk of egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry 
in equal quantities of butter and lard. 

BoUed Sea^kale. — Pick over very carefully, tie in bunch- 
es, and lay in cold water for an hour ; put into salted boil- 
ing water, add boil twenty or thirty minutes, until tender ; 
remove the thread, place on buttered toast, butter abun- 
dantly, and serve. 

Stewed Sea-kale. — Wash, clip off the stems, tie, and pro- 
ceed as above, but boil only fifteen minutes ; drain, remove 
the threads, and put into another saucepan with a little 
rich gravy ; stew until tender, dish, and serve. 

Ot?A/*«.— Wash, pick, and boil, in enough salted water to 
cover them, until tender; drain thoroughly, dish, and pour 
over them three tablespoon fuls of melted butter, a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, pepper and salt to taste. This sauce 
should be boiling hot. 

Kale-cannon, — Take equal quantities of boiled cabbage 
and potatoes ; chop the cabbage fine and mash the pota- 
toes; chop up and mix, also, one large boiled onion ; mix 
these all well together, adding a large lump of butter, salt, 
and black pepper; stew slowly over a moderate fire, and 
put into a covered dish. 



212 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Squash, Boiled. — ^Pare and cut in small pieces ; put them 
over the fire with just enough water to cover them, and 
keep the pot covered ; when they are tender enough drain 
thoroughly, mash to a smooth paste, adding butter, pep- 
per, and salt. 

Squashy Baked. — These receipts apply only to the mar- 
row squash. Prepare as for boiling, and put into a pan 
in a very slow oven ; put some water in the pan to keep 
them from burning ; then, when cooked, mash with but- 
ter, pepper, and salt. 

Summer Squash or CymUing. — Pare, quarter, take out 
the seeds, and lay the pieces in cold water ; then boil un- 
til very tender; drain thoroughly; mash soft and smooth 
with butter, white pepper, and salt. 

Winter Squash. — Pare, seed, and quarter as above; let 
it lie in cold water for two hours before cooking; then 
boil until very tender, and mash, etc., as above. 

Stewed Pumpkin. — Cat in two, seed, slice, and pare; 
soak in cold water for one hour ; then put over the fire in 
a pot of boiling water, and stew gently, stirring often un- 
til it breaks ; drain, press, and mash through a colander ; 
then return to the saucepan M-ith a tablespoonful of but- 
ter; pepper and salt to taste; stir rapidly until lieated 
through. 

Balced Pumpkin. — Choose a fine, rich pumpkin ; seed, 
pare, quarter, and cut in slices half an inch thick ; arrange 
in a wide, shallow baking-pan with a little water, two slices 
deep, arid bake very, very slowly until dry and tender ; 
then butter each strip on both sides, and eat with bread- 
and-butter.

while warm, three tablespoonf uls of melted butter (this is 
for a large dish); pat into a saucepan and heat, stiiTing 
constantly; when smoking hot add three tablespoonf nls 
of cream and a teaspoonf nl of white sugar ; boil up once, 
still stirring, and press firmly into a hot bowl or other 
mould; turn into a hot dish and garnish with boiled 
eggs. 

Boiled Spinach. — Invprim is^ al ways buy enough spinacl » , 
as it shrinks terribly in cooking ; a peck suffices for a fam- 
ily of four or five. Pick it over very carefully— it is apt to 
be gritty — wash in several waters, and let it lie in the last 
half an hour at least; take out with your hands, shak in ic 
each bunch well, and put into boiling water with a littlj 
salt; boil from fifteen to twenty minutes; when tender, 
drain thoroughly, chop very fine, put into a saucepan with 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, and pepper to taste ; 
stir until very hot, turn into a dish, and shape into a flat- 
topped mound with a silver or wooden spoon ; slice sonu 
hard-boiled eggs and lay on top. 

Or, for spinach gUuA^ nib the yolks of the eggs to a 
powder, mix with butter, and when your mound is raised, 
spread smoothly over tlie flat top. Four eggs will dress a 
good-sized dish. Cut the whites into rings, and garni&h, 
laying them on the yellow surface. This makes a pleasant 
dressing for the spinach. 

Mashed Turnips. — Peel, lay in slightly salted cold wa- 
ter for half an hour, put on in boiling water, boil tender, 
mash in the colander with a wooden spoon, stirring in at 
the last a tablespoon ful of butter with pepper and salt to 
taste, and serve hot. 

If eaten with boiled corned beef, you may take a little 
of the liquor from the p6t in which the meat is cooking; 
put it into a saucepan, boil up once to throw off the scum, 
skim clean, and cook turnips in this. 



^14 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Or, if the tnrnips are yonng, rob them, when tender,- 
through the colander ; add a little milk, batter, pepper, and 
salt ; heat to boiling in a clean saucepan, and serve. 

Yowag Turnips^ Boiled Whole. — Pare smoothly, and 
trim all into the same size and shape ; lay in cold water 
half an hour;. put on in boiling water with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, and stew until tender; drain dry without 
crushing or breaking them, pile in a deep dish, and cover 
with a rich white sauce ; cat hot. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — ^Pnt ten or twelve large, ripe tomatoes 
into a pan, and pour scalding water over them to remove 
the skins ; peel and cut out all the hard parts, then cut in 
half horizontally and take the seeds out ; mince an onion 
fine and add it, with pepper and salt to taste ; put them 
on to stew in a pipkin and let them simmer seveml hours, 
the longer the better ; when they have stewed an hour, add 
a piece of butter the cize of an egg, and five tablespoonfuls 
of rolled bread crumbs; stir well, and twenty minutes 
later add three lumps of loaf sugar. 

Ochra aiid Tomatoes. — Stew for an hour a can of toma- 
toes, adding pepper and salt; wash a quarter of a peck 
of young and tender ochra, cut off the stems, throw theui 
into the stewpan with the tomatoes ; and let them all stew 
gently until the ochra begins to open; then stir them well; 
add a little onion to the tomatoes ; when first put on sea- 
son with pepper (red) and salt, stir in two lumps of loaf 
sugar, and serve very liot. 

Scallop of Tomato and Ochra. — Prepare as above, ar- 
range in a baking-dish with layers of bread crumbs, and 
bake. Very good. 

Scallop of Tomatoes and Sice. — Boil one pint of rice,, and 
mix in it, while hot, one large spoonful of butter, and pep- 



VEGETABLES. 215 

per and salt to taste; i^dd one can of tomatoes and one tea- 
spoonfnl of sagar; bake in a well-greased pan. 

SoaUoped Tomaioea and Green Clwvi.-^Make as above, 
substituting for the rice a pint of green corn cut from the 
cob and boiled, and seasoning with some fat pork minced 
fine, a chopped shallot, pepper, salt, and sugar; pack in a 
pudding-dish in layers ; let the top layer be tomatoes, but- 
ter, and seasoning ; sift rolled bread crumbs over the top 
to brown the scallop; bake covered half an hour; then 
uncover and brown. 

Scalloped Tomatoes.— Feel and cut in slices a quarter 
of an inch thick ; pack in a pudding-dish in alternate lay- 
ers with a forcemeat made of rolled bread crumbs, salt, 
pepper, butter, and a little white sugar; spread thickly 
upon each stratum of tomatoes, and when the dish is near- 
ly full, put tomatoes uppermost, a good bit of butter upon 
each one ; dust with pepper and a little sugar ; strew with 
dried bread crumbs, bake, covered, lialf an hour, remove the 
lid, and bake brown. 

Tomatoee and Eggs: — ^Peel the skins from a dozen large 
tomatoes, put four ounces of butter into a frying-pan, add 
a small onion minced fine, and pepper and salt to taste ; 
fry the tomatoes, and from time to time chop them while 
frying ; wheti the tomatoes are well cooked break six eggs 
into the pan, stir the whole quickly, and serve hot. 

Baked Tomatoes^ Stuffed. — Take fine, large tomatoes, 
cut a piece off the top, and with an apple-corer or sharp 
knife carefully remove the hard part in the middle of the 
tomato, and scoop otit as large a hole as posi^ible without 
spoiling the shape ; make a stuffing of rolled bread crumbs, 
a very little onion mashed to a pulp, a pinch of white sug- 
ar, s^t and pepper to taste, a little tomato mashed smooth, 
and enough melted butter to bind all well together; fill 



216 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK* 

each of the tomatoes with this, put a small piece of butter 
on top, and bake them slowly in the oven. 

Fried Tomatohs^ Stuffed, — ^Prepare as above, but divide 
in the middle ; when well stuffed fry in butter. 

Baked Tomatoes, — ^Prepare the tomatoes, and season 
them exactly as for stewing ; place them in a baking-dish 
in layers, with bread crumbs between, and little dots of 
butter ; put the dish in a slow oven, and bake for half an 
hour or longer. 



^o^ 



Sliced Baked Tomatoes. — Cut them in slices without re- 
moving the skin, and put about three layers in a deep pie 
plate; sprinkle on each layer pepper, salt, and bread crumbs, 
with butter on the crumbs; bake slowly for three hours. 

Fried Tomatoes, — Cut them in slices, flour them well, 
and fry them slowly in the fat from fried pork. 

Broiled Tomatoes, — Select large firm ones, and do not 
peel ; slice half an inch thick, and broil upon an oyster 
gridiron ; a few minutes will cook them ; have ready in a 
cup some hot melted butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, a 
little sugar, and half a teaspoonf ul of made mustard ; as 
soon as the tomatoes are done, dip each piece in the mixt- 
ure, and lay on a hot chafing-dish ; when all are dished, 
heat the rest of the sauce to a boil, pour upon them, and 
serve at once. 

Raw Tomatoes. — ^Peel carefully with a sharp knife; 
slice and lay in a glass dish ; dress with simple French 
dressing, with mm/ormoAse^ with Duke of York's sauce, 
or with cold rovigatte. Tomatoes are excellent with any 
one of the three ; but, perhaps, best of all, with a cream 
mayonnaise. Tomato salad should always be set on the 
ice for two or three hours before serving. 



MACARONI. 

Home-rnade Macaroni (Neapolitan receipt). — Take some 
fine wheat flour and sift it carefully into a heap on your 
moulding-board ; make a hole in the middle of the heap, 
and break into the hole one or two eggs, according to the 
quantity of flour ; then, with the aid of a little warm wa- 
ter, work the flour and egg into a smooth, stiff paste ; this 
done, proceed to roll out the paste with a rolling-pin, sprink- 
ling a little sifted flour on each sheet ; when you have rolled 
ont all the paste into very thin sheets, cut each sheet with 
a paste-cutter into strips, stars, etc. ; then put the paste for 
three or four hours in a cool, dry place. You may then 
use it for macaroni soup, macaroni vol au vent, etc. It is 
extremely delicate, and preferred by aU Italian hon-vi/oants 
to bought macaroni. 

Macaroni, Plain. — Put in an iron stewpan two quarts 
of water ; allow, it to boil ; add two teaspoonfuls of salt 
and one ounce of butter, then add one pound of macaroni ; 
boil till tender, but let it be rather firm to the touch ; it is 
then ready for use, either in soup, pudding, or to be dressed 
with cheese. It should always be drained in a colander 
before using it. 

Macaroni with Tomato Saicce. — Prepare the macaroni 
as above, drain on a colander, put into a hot dish, and pour 
over it a rich, thick tomato sauce. 

Macaroni Stewed with JSrown Gravy. — Prepare the 
macaroni as above. To prepare the sauce, cut a pound of 

10 



218 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

absolutely lean beef into the smallest possible dice, and 
stew for two hours. The water should be cold when the 
meat is put in. At the end of the lirst half-hour add a 
pint of onions peeled, sliced, and lightly fried in butter; 
at the end of two hours strain, add a teaspoonful of cara- 
mel for browning and the same of browned flour, and pour 
over the macaroni. 

Macaroni with Liver, — Take equal quantities of chick- 
en liver and calPs liver, and boil in water which haa been 
very slightly salted; boil also with the liver an onion, a 
spoonful of mushroom powder, a bunch of sweet herbs, a 
glassful of marsala, a laurel leaf, also a little grated rind 
of lemon, and a pinch of burned sugar; when cooked rub 
the liver to a paste in a mortar, adding, little by little, 
enough melted butter to moisten it ; work into it a tea- 
spoonful of white pepper, half a grated nutmeg, a little 
cloves, and salt to taste ; work all together thorouglily and 
smoothly; meanwhile have ready some cold boiled maca- 
roni, butter a timbale mould, and line it with the maca- 
roni and fill it with the liver, putting in also, at proper in- 
tervals, square and triangular bits of cold tongue, and some 
bits of the inside of the gizzard of fowls cut to imitate 
truffles ; cover the timbale, and heat the macaroni and liv- 
er cL bain-marie for half an hour ; turn out and serve hot. 

Macaroni Baked with Cheese, — Put three ounces of mac- 
aroni into a pint of water when the water is bubbling, and 
boil until tender; then drain thoroughly, and put into a 
deep earthenware pie-dish in the following manner : Grate 
a quarter of a pound of good Parmesan cheese; put a lay- 
er of macaroni and a layer of cheese alternately until the 
dish is filled, taking care to sprinkle a soupqon of cayenne 
over each layer; then heat in a saucepan five tablespoon- 
f uls of cream with a piece of butter the size of a walnut ; 
when boiling pour this over the macaroni ; then with two 
silver forks toss the whole mass together until thoroughly 



MACARONI. 219 

mixed; again dast the top with grated cheese, cover with 
a thick layer of bread crumbs dotted with little bits of 
fresh butter; put into a quick oven for ten minutes, and 
serve in the dish with a clean napkin pinned round it. 

Jugged Maearoni. — Put two ]>ounds of lean beef, en- 
tirely freed from skin and fat, into a jar with some maca- 
roni (pipe macaroni is best for this purpose), an onion 
minced fine, a pint and a half of tomatoes peeled, sliced, 
and cored, two or three mushrooms, as many truffles in 
thin slices, the half of a small red-pepper pod, and two or 
three peppercorns. The jar should, be well rnbbed with 
garlic beforehand, and enough cold water poured in to 
barely cover the hottom of it; the meat should be cut into 
strips; cook very slowly — ^the slower the better — A hain- 
marie^ keeping the jar hermetically sealed ; the beef should 
cook for at least three hours before adding the vegetables ; 
the vegetables again for two hours and a half or three before 
putting in the macaroni; the macaroni, of course, should 
cook until tender; serve with the sauce in which it has 
been cooked. The sauce should be strained through a col- 
ander. 

Stuffed Macaroni. — Take large pipe macaroni (as large, 
if possible, as Italian bread) ; break it as nearly as possible 
into even lengths; then stuff each piece of macaroni with a 
mince composed of cold chicken chopped fine, some calves 
brain (which should previously have been boiled), some 
bread crumbs soaked in good stock, a little grated Parme- 
san cheese, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and a little 
powdered parsley ; cook the macaroni, when stuffed, for 
twenty minutea or longer in a little thin broth ; pour some 
tomato sauce over it and serve. 

Macaroni with Giblet Sauce, — ^Break the macaroni into 
two-inch lengths, and stew in boiling water until tender ; 
prepare the giblet sauce beforehand ; chop the giblets fine. 



220 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

and stew them in just broth enough to cover them until 
they are tender; when nearly cooked add a teacnpful of 
strong stock thickened with browned flour; boil np once 
before serving, arrange the macaroni in the centre of the 
dish, and pour the giblet sauce (which should be as thick 
as a ragout) all round it ; garnish with the round, unbro- 
ken yolks of twelve hard-boiled eggs. This is a very pret- 
ty dish, and is called by the Italians macaroni reale. 

Macaroni di VAheille. — One quarter of a pound of pipe 
macaroni, scalded until tender, and cut into pieces one 
third of an inch long. 

Mince of every kind of cold meat, fowl, or game ; add 
some ham chopped fine, some pepper, salt, a sov^p^pn of 
cayenne, a teaspoonful of tomato catsup, and the same 
of Worcestershire sauce, and a tablespoonful of mixed 
chopped onion and sweet herbs; pour over the mince 
enough brown' gravy to moisten it well ; butter a basin 
and line it completely with macaroni, sticking the pieces 
so closely together as to give the appearance of honey- 
comb; then fill with the mince, covering the top with 
macaroni; tie a pudding- cloth over the basin, and boil 
one hour if the basin is large; take it out of the water 
five minutes before turning it out of the mould, and serve 
with a strong brown gravy poured over it. 

Macaroni d la Richelieu, — Three ounces of macaroni 
boiled until tender ; two eggs beaten light ; some cold veal 
and lean ham minced very fine ; a pinch of pepper ; a salt- 
spoonful of sugar; a little grated lemon peel. 

Mix the mince well and smoothly; then butter a melon- 
shaped mould and line with the macaroni, fill up with 
the mince, and boil five minutes ; turn out of the mould, 
and serve with good gravy poured over it. 

Tirnbale of Macarorii and Chicken. — Butter a timhale 
mould well, sprinkle it with bread crumbs, and line with 



MACARONI. 221 

puff paste ; filj with the following mixture : Some maca- 
roni boiled in water with an ounce of butter ; chicken 
skinned, boned, and fricasseed; half a pint of strong 
stock ; a little grated Parmesan cheese. When the maca- 
roni has boiled a few minutes, strain and return it to the 
pan ; add the stock, boil it slowly on the stove until re- 
duced, then put in the chicken and cheese, and toss until 
thoroughly heated ; remove from the stove, and when cold 
pour into the timbale mould ; cover and bake in a slow 
oven ; turn out of the form and serve in the timbale of paste. 

Macaroni d VAmaLfi. — Butter a timbale form, and line 
it with half puff paste, very slightly sweetened ; prepare 
the macaroni as directed in No. 1, and put it when cold 
into the timbale, dotting each layer with butter, and dust- 
ing it lightly with dried and grated ham ; cover, and bake 
in a slow oven ; turn out of the tin form, and serve in the 
timbale of paste ; eat very hot. 

Ma,caroni d la Sorrento. — Prepare the macaroni as di- 
rected in No. 1, but after draining return it to the pan and 
add four and a half ounces of grated cheese, a little butter, 
salt and pepper. In another saucepan have ready some 
small flat cakes made of boiled mush ; toss these about 
until the macaroni is ready ; arrange these cakes in a circle 
on a round dish ; heap the macaroni in the middle, and 
pour the cheese and butter over all. 

TorteUi alia Bolognese. — Take some home-made maca- 
roni, made according to the foregoing receipt, but, instead 
of cutting it into strips, cut it into small squares, and put 
into the middle of each square a teaspoonf ul of mince ; 
fold the square carefully, taking care that the sides over- 
lap, so that there is no possibility of the tortello's bursting 
open ; then drop into boiling broth, and cool for twenty 
minutes over a quick fire. They may be served in soup, 
or separately, in a dish, with tomato, giblet, or spinach 
sauce poured over them. 



222 THE UNBIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Tuscan Lambkins. — Cut some home-made macaroni into 
small squares as above ; in the middle of each square put 
a spoonful of mince, made in the following manner: Chop 
very finely tlie wliite meat of some cold boiled chicken, 
and mix with it some bread crumbs soaked in cream, some 
calves' brain, boiled and chopped fine, a little powdered 
roasted parsley, a little boiled celery, two hard-boiled eggs, 
salt to taste, about two ounces grated Parmesan cheese, 
and a soupqon of nutmeg; chop all the ingredients fine, and 
mix smootlily together ; fold the paste carefully round the 
mince, and drop each ball or square into boiling broth, and 
cook as above ; meanwhile cook in another stewpan some 
onions chopped fine, some celery, a clove of garlic, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and some butter ; add a very little 
water, and stir continually ; when nearly cooked, add a 
spoonful of brown flour, some tomatoes stewed and strained 
through a colander, and a pinch of burned sugar ; arrange 
the "lambkins" in layers in a deep dish, pouring the 
sauce above mentioned over each layer, and sprinkling 
each layer also with grated Parmesan cheese ; use abun- 
dance of both sauce and cheese. These little " lambkins," 
if properly prepared, will be found very good. 

Genoese Lasagne, — Take some home-made macaroni, 
cut into strips an inch wide and four inches long ; cook 
in good broth, drain and arrange in a dish, pouring over 
them a sauce made of beef essence, thickened with grated 
fillet of beef, and finely chopped onion and celery ; the fillet 
of beef, onions, and celery should be fried in butter to a 
light brown before adding them to the beef juice; the 
beef juice should heat oL hain-marie^ and the onions, fillet, 
and celery be dropped in boiling hot; the sauce thus pre- 
pared should be poured at once over the lasagne. 

Pamned Macaroni, — Take some home-made macaroni 
paste, and, after rolling it out as thin as possible, cut into 
strips about a quarter of an inch wide; set away to dry for 



MACARONI. 223 

four or five hours, and then drop into boiling water, 
slightly salted; cook fifteen or twenty minutes; have 
ready a large, wide, and very shallow earthen dish ; butter 
this dish, and line completely with finely rolled and 
browned bread crumbs; cover with a layer of macaroni. 
If the dish be so shallow that it will only admit of one 
thick layer of macaroni, so much the better; stick little bits 
of fresh butter among the macaroni, cover with a layer of 
rolled bread crumbs and grated Sardinian cheese, and 
brown in a quick oven. 



SALADS. 

Rules for Salad Dressing. — " The dressing of the salad 
should be saturated with oil, and seasoned with pepper 
and salt before the vinegar is added. It results from this 
process that there never can be too much vinegar; for, 
from the specific gravity of the vinegar compared with 
oil, what is moie than useful will fall to the bottom of the 
bowl. The salt should not be dissolved in the vinegar, 
but in the oil, by which means it is more equally distribu- 
ted throughout the salad" {Cliaptal^ a French chemist). 
The Spanish proverb saj^s: "A spendthrift for oil, a nig- 
gard for vinegar, a wise man for salt, and a madman to 
mix the whole together." 

Mayonnaise. — The yolks of two raw eggs ; fine oil of 
Lucca enough to work the mayonnaise to a cream ; salt 
to taste; mustard to taste; vinegar to taste; a tiny — the 
very tiniest — pinch of powdered sugar. 

Break the eggs very carefully, and put the yolks into a 
shallow dish ; then add the oil drop by drop, stirring 
steadily one way with a wooden or silver fork; then add 
the salt, then the mustard and sugar, and last of all the 
vinegar, drop by drop. The stirring should go on all the 
time without intermission or change of direction, and the 
mayonnaise^ when finished, should be of the consistency 
and smoothness of the richest fresh cream. Lemon juice 
may be substituted for vinegar. 

Cream Mayonnaise. — Take of rich, fresh, thick cream 
one pint — one half plain, one half whipped light; the 
yolks of four hard-boiled eggs; one teaspoonful of salt; 



SALADS. 226 

one teaspoonful of made mustard; one teaspoonful of 
white pepper ; two teaspoonf uls of white powdered sugar ; 
one teaspoonful of roasted powdered parsley ; foiir tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice. 

Kub the yolks of the eggs to a fine powder, then add 
the salt, pepper, and sugar, grinding them hard and 
rubbing all smoothly together; then work in the plain 
cream drop by drop, then the mustard, then the whipped 
cream and parsley, and, lastly, the lemon juice, which 
must be whipped in, a few drops at a time. 

Sydney Smithes Receipt for SaHad Dressing, — 

** Two boiled potatoes, strained through the kitchen sieve. 
Softness and smoothness to the salad give. 
Of mordant mustard take a single spoon ; 
Distrust the condiment that bites too soon, 
Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt. 
Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 
And twice with vinegar procured from town. 
True taste requires it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. 
Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole. 
And, lastly, in the flavored compound toss 
A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. 
Oh, great and glorious ! oh, herbaceous meat ! 
'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat. 
Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul, 
And plunge his fingers in the salad-bowl.*' 

JSicssian JSalad, — Boil some carrots and turnips in salt- 
ed water with a small piece of butter, but do not let them 
be overdone. When cold, cut out of them with a vegeta- 
ble scoop a number of pieces the size of an olive ; cut 
some beetroot in the same way, likewise some truffles 
and pickled mushrooms ; have ready some cold boiled 
potatoes prepared in the same way, some green pease, 
some haricot beans (cooked), some string beans, some as- 
paragus points, and one or two button onions (also cooked) ; 
take equal parts of all these (except the onions), two ta-

226 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

blespoonf Ills of capers, two tablespoonfuls of pickled gher- 
kins, two tablespoonfuls of anchovies or sardines, washed 
clean, skinned, and boned ; two dozen olives, stoned ; one 
tablespoonful of tarragon and chervil, and one teaspoonf ul 
of cliives. Kub a disli with garlic, and arrange the vege- 
tables, fish, olives, pickles, etc., symmetrically in it ; sprin- 
kle over it a very little roasted parsley; then make a 
dressing of olive-oil, vinegar, raw yolks of eggs, pepper, 
salt, and the herbs above mentioned, worked smoothly to- 
gether. (See " Mayonnaise.") Ornament with hard-boiled 
eggs, lobster spawn, caviare, pickles, trnifles, etc., and with^ 
Spanish cafp^'cums {Piementes dulces) — a great addition 
on account of their exquisite color and flavor. 

Dutch Salad. — Wash, split, and bone a dozen ancho- 
vies, and roll each one up; wash, split and bone one her- 
ring, and cut it up into small pieces; cut up into dice an 
equal quantity of Bologna or Lyons sausage, or of smoked 
ham and sausage ; also, an equal quantity of the breast of 
cold roast fowl or cold veal ; add likewise, always in the 
same quantity and cut into dice, beetroot, pickled cucum- 
bers, cold l)oiled potatoes, cut in larger dice, and in quan- 
tity according to taste, but at least thrice as much potato 
as anything else ; add a tablespoonful of capers, the yolks 
and whites of some hard-boiled eggs, minced separately, 
and a dozen stoned olives ; mix all the ingredients well 
together, reserving the olives and anchovies to orna- 
ment the top of the bowl ; beat up together oil and tar- 
ragon vinegar with white pepper and French mustard to 
taste ; pour this over the salad and serve. 

Dutch Salad, — Thoroughly wash four soft-roed bloaters, 
remove the bones and skin, and put the roes aside; ar- 
range the four fillets of each fish neatly round the dish; 
chop finely and separately the whites and yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs ; also, some parsley, some shallot or par- 
boiled onion, and some pickled beetroot, keeping each 



SALADS. 227 

separate ; lay these different things in some sort of pat- 
tern in the centre of the dish ; take the roes and uiash 
them with a silver or wooden spoon, adding enough oil 
and vinegar to make a thickisli sauce; pepper to taste, 
and pour evenly over the herring fillets. 

Pickled Bloaters. — Take a dozen bloaters ; wash them 
thoroughly ; drain dry, skin, and bone them, and lay them 
in enough good milk to completely cover them. When 
they have lain in this for twenty-four hours, drain them 
thoroughly, and lay them in a pie-dish with half a dozen 
slices of lemon and the same quantity of Spanish and 
Portugal onion, four bay-leaves, two ounces of capers, a 
dozen cloves, eighteen peppercorns, and as much oil and 
vinegar, in equal proportions, as will completely cover the 
herrings. Lay them in a cool place until wanted. 

Artichoke Salad. — Choose fine, fresh artichokes, not too 
large, and boil them whole, adding a little essence of spin- 
ach to preserve their green color; when quite tender, 
drain, arrange in a dish, and set away to cool ; prepare a 
simple dressing of oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt ; serve the 
artichokes quite cold, and the dressing in a sauce-boat. 

Beet Salad. — Choose small, young beets, pink and 
white ; boil until tender, set away to cool, and serve 
cold, with a cream mayonnaise poured over them. This 
is a delicious salad, and is much prettier if the beets are 
so- young that they can be served whole. Arrange in a 
pyramid in alternate stripes of pink and white. 

Blakdy Egg Mayonnaise. — Boil hard one dozen and 
a half of eggs ; throw them into cold water ; peel them 
carefully, and cut each Oig'g in two crosswise; take all 
the yolks, mash them, season with salt, plenty of red 
pepper, celery chopped fine, grated eschalottes, horserad- 
ish scraped very fine, mango pickles chopped, and moisten 



228 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

it all with olive-oil; stuflE the whites of the eggs with 
this, make a mayonnaise dressing, arrange the staffed eggs 
on a dish with bunches of lettuce-hearts, and garnish with 
the mayonnaise dressing. 

Potato aiid Herring Salad. — Boil some potatoes un- 
peeled ; when cold cut them in slices, or with a potato- 
cutter into tiny balls; peel and cut also into balls two 
sour apples, some pickled cucumbers, and one or two salt 
herrings, which must previously have been boned; put 
the potatoes into a salad bowl and salt and pepper them 
lightly; then dress with oil and a very little vinegar; add 
the herrings, apples, cucumbers, a tablespoonf ul of chopped 
onions, and, last of all, some pickled beets; stir all the in- 
gredients well together, and serve. 

Plain Potato Salad. — Peel some cold boiled potatoes 
and slice fine ; rub a salad bowl with garlic, and put in 
the potatoes ; dress them with salt, white pepper, oil, and 
vinegar, and add, last of all, a tablespoonful of onion 
chopped fine, and the same quantity of roasted powdered 
parsley. 

Coleslaw, — Choose a firm white cabbage and shred it 
fine ; do not chop it ; pour over it Philadelphia sauce for 
Coleslaw No. 1 or 2 ; the sauce must be poured boiling 
hot over the slaw, which must then be set away to cool ; 
eat cold. 

BakedrBean Salad. — Put some cold baked beans in a 
salad bowl, and dress with vinegar, white pepper, salt, a 
tablespoonful of brown sugar, and a soupcon of oil. 

String-Bean Salad. — Boil some string beans until ten- 
der in salt and water; when cold arrange in a salad bowl 
which has been rubbed with garlic ; dress with salt, pep- 
per, oil (plenty of it), and lemon juice in lieu of vinegar. 



SALADS. 229 

Letttice Salad. — Pull the lettuce to pieces with your fin- 
gers, arrange in a salad bowl, and dress with salt, pepper, 
oil, and vinegar ; toss with two wooden forks until every 
leaf is thoroughly dressed. 

Or, you may use a mayonnaise dressing. 

Cdery Salad, — ^Wash and scrape the celery, and cut into 
bits half an inch long ; have ready some good mayonnaise 
^nd pour over the celery ; eat at once. 

Tomato Salad. — Twelve medium-sized tomatoes peeled 
and sliced ; one button onion chopped fine ; a mayonnaise 
made of the yolks of six raw eggs and oil in proportion, 
two teaspoonfuls of made mustard, one teaspoon ful of salt, 
two teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper, the same of sugar, and 
vinegar to taste. 

Set the salad dish on the ice while you prepare the may- 
onnaise^ which should be rich and thick as cream ; pour 
the mmjonnaise on the tomatoes, and leave all on the ice 
for fifteen minutes longer ; then serve. 

Or, you may use the cream WAiyonnaise^ which is deli- 
cious for tomatoes. 

Cucumber Salad. — Choose fresh, ripe cucumbers ; pare, 
slice very thin, and lay in ice-water for an hour ; then put 
into a dish rubbed with garlic, and dress with oil, vinegar, 
pepper, and salt ; lay a piece of ice in the dish, and serve. 

Mixed Summer Salad ('* Common-Sense in the House- 
hold"). — Three heads of lettuce; two teaspoonfuls of 
green mustard leaves; a handful of water-cresses; five 
tender radishes; one cucumber; three hard-boiled eggs; 
two teaspoonfuls of white sugar ; one teaspoonf ul of salt ; 
one teaspoonf ul of pepper ; one teaspoonf ul of made mus- 
tard ; one teacupf nl of vinegar ; half a teacupf ul of oil. 

Mix all well together, and serve with a lump of ice in 
the middle. 



230 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Water-cress Salad, — Wash and pick carefully, pull to 
pieces, and dress with vinegar, oil, pepper, and salt. 

Chicken Salad, — Tiie white meat of cold boiled chicken 
or turkey ; three quarters of the same bulk of chopped 
celery ; a rich mayonnaise. 

Chop the meat fine, removing every scrap of fat, gristle, 
and skin ; mix carefully with the celery, and set in a cold 
place while you mix the mayonnaise. Be sure to make 
enough maifonnaise^ not only to mix thoroughly with the 
chicken, but to lie on the top ; garnish with a wreath of 
lettuce hearts, hard-boiled eggs, pickled cucumbers and 
beets cut into shape. 

Lobster Salad, — Pick out every bit of meat from the 
body and claws of a cold boiled lobster ; lay aside the cor- 
al for the dressing; when the lobster is finely minced, 
make a rich Tnayonnaise dressing; mix the lobster coral 
with it to give it a fine color; then mix well and thorough- 
ly with the lobster, adding at the last moment some fresh, 
crisp lettuce leaves ; cover the lobster with a thick layer 
of mayonnaise^ and garnish with lettuce hearts and small 
boiled shrimps and prawns. 

Salmon Salad, — Mince some cold boiled salmon finely, 
and cut the rest into well-shaped fillets of even size; lay 
these in a bath of oil and vinegar ; mix some mxiyon/naise 
smoothly with the minced salmon, shape into a pyramid, 
and lay the fillets upright against the pyramid, filling up 
the interstices between the fillets with pickled cucumbers, 
beets, and hard-boiled eggs cut into pretty shapes. 

Serve cucumbers with salmon m/iyonnaise^ and use in 
preference the cream mayonnaise for dressing cold salmon. 

Cheese Salad will be found under the head of " Cheese." 

Parisienne Salad, — Cut into thin slices a red beet baked 



SALADS. 231 

in the oven, also some boiled celery, and an equal quantity 
of boiled potatoes; put all into a salad bowl with some 
grated horseradish, and dress with oil and vinegar ; press 
the yolks of five hard-boiled eggs through a sieve, add two 
teaspoonfuls olpurSe of anchovies, and half a tumblerful 
of oil of Lucca ; work all smoothly together with a wood- 
en spoon ; then add a teaspoonf ul of good mustard, a little 
tarragon vinegar, four teaspoonfuls of pickled tunny cut 
into dice, as many of pickled cucumbers cut into dice, a 
pinch of cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of the white of egg 
cut into dice, a pinch of chopped tarragon, then the vege- 
tables chopped tine and drained ; mix all together and put 
into the salad bowl. 

Truffle Salad d la TovZousaine. — Peel and slice very 
finely six black truffles ; when sliced put them in a cov- 
ered jar ; take some young, fresh artichokes, pull oS. the 
hard outer leaves, and slice the inner and tenderer ones 
finely ; let them stand for ten minutes with a little salt, 
then brush off the salt ; pass the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs through a sieve ; mix with them a little mustard, half 
a glassful of the finest oil of Lucca, and some good tarra- 
gon vinegar; rub a salad bowl with a clove of garlic, and 
arrange in it the truffles and artichokes in alternate layers, 
seasoning them lightly with a very little salt and pepper, 
and with a little of the dressing; let all stand ten minutes, 
then pour in the rest of the dressing, and toss the salad 
with two wooden forks until it is thoroughly assimilated. 

Bla^h Truffle Salad d la Husse, — Peel some raw truf- 
fles, put them into a shallow saucepan with a little Madeira, 
salt slightly, and cook four minutes; then chop them, put 
them into a deep dish, season them, and pour on a little 
oil ; cover, and let them soak for ten minutes ; then dust 
with a pinch each of tarragon, of parsley, and of chives, 
chopped fine, and add several spoonfuls of mayonnaise ; 
mix well, arrange in a shallow dish, and cover with a thick 
layer of mayonnaise. 



232 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Mamie^a Coleslaw. — Cut a fine, crisp white cabbage 
into fine shreds, and make a sauce as follows : The yolks 
of two eggs, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, two ta- 
blespoonf uls of thick cream, two tablespoonf uls of the best 
vinegar. Beat eggs, butter, and vinegar together, with 
pepper and salt to taste ; then heat in a small saucepan, 
stirring all the time ; do not let it boil ; when smooth and 
thick remove from the fire, pour into a bowl, and set in a 
cool place ; when cool beat in the cream, pour over the 
cabbage, and toss with two silver forks. 

Ca/uliflowm* SIoajo. — Cut some cold boiled caulifiower 
into small flowers, and pour over the sauce above described. 
It is very good. 

Marian Sanice (" Common-Sense in the Household "). — 
Five tablespoonf uls of fresh butter ; a teacupf ul of vine- 
gar ; salt and pepper to taste, with a heaping teaspoonf ul 
of white sugar; one teaspoonf ul of made mustard; one 
tablespoonf ul of roast parsley. 

Beat the butter to a cream, adding gradually the vine- 
gar, salt, and pepper, then the parsley, sugar, and mus- 
tard; the butter should be light as whipped egg; send to 
table red-hot. 

Philadelphia Sa/ace for Coleslaw^ No. 1. — One cupful 
of vinegar ; one tablespoonf ul of butter ; one tablespoon- 
f ul of sugar ; two tablespoonf uls of sour cream ; a pinch' 
of pepper, and the same of salt. 

Put the vinegar, with all the ingredients for the dress- 
ing except the cream, into a porcelain-lined saucepan, and 
let them come to a boil ; pour scalding hot over the slaw 
and set away until quite cold ; just before serving add the 
cream, beating it in with a silver fork. This preparation 
of coleslaw is very nice and digestible. 

Philadelphia Sauce for CcHedanjo^ No. 2. — One pint of 



SALADS. 233 

the best milk ; one piece of butter half the size of an egg ; 
two eggs, yolks only ; one tablespoonf ul of the best vin- 
egar. 

Put all the ingredients into a porcelain-lined saucepan, 
and stir steadily until the butter melts and the sauce thick- 
ens ; do not allow it to boil ; pour boiling hot over the 
slaw, which must previously have been cut to the finest 
possible shreds and duly salted ; eat cold. 



CHEESE. 

Cheese Salad (Mock Crab) (" Common - Sense in the 
Household"). — Half a pound of pickled shrimps ; a quarter 
of a pound of good old cheese ; one tablespponf ul of salad 
oil ; one teaspoonf ul of cayenne pepper ; one teaspoonf ul 
of salt; one teaspoonf ul of while sugar; one teaspoonf ul of 
made mustard; four tablespoonfuls of celery or onion 
vinegar. 

Mince the shrimps and grate the cheese ; work into the 
latter, a little at a time, the various condiments enumerated 
above, the vinegar last ; let all stand together ten minutes 
before adding the shrimps ; when this is done, stir well 
for a minute, and serve in crab or scallop shells. 

Cheese DevUs. — Half a pound of old cheese, grated ; one 
hard-boiled egg ; one teacupf ul of minced chicken ; one tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper ; one teaspoonf ul of salt ; one 
teaspoonf ul of white sugar; one teaspoonf ul of made mus- 
tard ; one tablespoonful of onion vinegar ; one tablespoon- 
f ul of salad oil or melted butter. 

Kub the yolk of the egg to a paste with the oil, adding 
in order the salt, pepper, sugar, mustard, and cheese ; lastly, 
the chicken ; serve in crab or scallop shells. 

Parmesan Fondue (Brillat Savarin). — Melt half an 
ounce of fresh butter into a saucepan, stir into it a table- 
spoonful of flour ; when the two are well amalgamated, 
put in a small quantity of milk and about three ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese ; stir the mixture on a slow fire 
until it assumes the appearance of thick cream, but be 
careful not to let it boil ; then add one clove of garlic, a 



CHEESE. 236 

small qaantity of flour of mustard, a soupgon of powdered 
nutmeg, and some white pepper ; mix thoroughly, and, if 
required, add a little salt ; keep on stirring the mixture at 
a very moderate heat for about ten minutes, then remove 
the clove of garlic ; take the saucepan off the fire, and stir 
the contents occasionally until quite cold ; then stir into 
it the yolks of three eggs beaten up with a little milk 
and strained, and finally the whites of five eggs beaten to 
a stiff froth ; pour the mixture into a deep round tin ; set 
it in the oven (which must not be too hot); in about 
twenty or thirty minutes the fondue will have risen and 
taken color; pin a napkin round it, and serve quickly. 

Wekh liarehit of Cheese d la Braine. — This dish must 
- be made on the table, in the dining-room, and in presence 
of the guests, as the delay of a moment is fatal to its ex- 
cellence ; have ready some old Dutch or double Glouces- 
tershire cheese, not too hard ; cut off the rind and put into 
a silver chafing-dish, with one quarter the quantity of but- 
ter ; stir continually, and as it melts add more butter, the 
proportion being one third as much butter as cheese; 
when it begins to boil, add mustard and pepper to taste, 
and a 80up<pn of onion or celery vinegar ; meanwhile some 
white bread must have been toasted on both sides, and 
must be handed round to the guests hoi^when the rarebit 
iegins to hoil ; each guest should butter his toast quickly 
on both sides, and the plates must be passed rapidly to the 
cook in chief, who will pour the boiling rarebit over the 
toast. Pale ale should be taken with it ; a little poured 
over the rarebit is an improvement. 

Cheese Aigrettes.— Three ounces of grated Parmesan 
cheese; two ounces of butter; two ounces of finest sifted 
flour, yolks of three eggs, and whites of two (beaten to a 
stiff froth), and a half-pint of water. 

Boil the water and butter together; stir the flour into 
this, continuing gently until it is cooked {i, ^., when it 



236 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

thickens) ; remove saucepan from fire, and throw one third 
quantity of cheese into the mixture ; stir, and add one egg ; 
mix and beat all together, then add more cheese and an- 
other egg, etc.; when all are mixed together, the compound 
must be beaten thoroughly until very light ; spread it on 
plates to cool ; when cold, it should be quite set ; fry in 
boiling lard, dropping in a tablespoonful at a time ; in 
frying, they swell and gape before they are ready. 

Cheese Souffle. — Melt half an ounce of fresh butter in a 
saucepan; stir in one tablespoonful of flour; when well 
amalgamated, put in a small quantity of milk and three 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese ; stir over a slow fire till 
like thick cream, but do not let it boil ; add white pepper 
and a tiny pinch of salt; keep on stirring the mixture at 
a moderate heat for ten minutes ; take the saucepan from 
the fire, and stir the contents until cold, then stir in the 
yolks of three eggs, beaten up with milk and strained, 
and finally the whites of five eggs beaten to a stiflf froth ; 
fill some papere with the mixture, and bake for from ten 
to fifteen minutes. 

Piedmontese Cheese Sticks. — Take some Italian bread 
(the slender brown sticks known in Tuscany as pone Pie- 
montese) ; cut it into even lengths and brown quickly; 
have ready some melted butter, and dip the bread quickly 
in it; allow it to cool again, and in the meantime j)repare 
in a saucepan some grated Parmesan cheese, a little butter 
and cream ; add a SQwpqon of onions, salt, and pepper to 
taste ; allow this to come to the consistency of thick cream, 
and proceed to fill the Pied montese bread in the following 
manner : Wrap one end of the stick in white paper, and, 
placing it on end, fill it with the cheese cream, which may 
be poured in through a tiny paper funnel ; when all are 
filled and cold roll them in beaten white of egg, and after- 
wards in finely rolled bread crumbs, delicately browned, 
and mingled with equal parts of roasted powdered pareley ; 



CHEESE. 2Z1 

remove the paper caps, and egg and bread-crumb the ends. 
This is an extremely pretty and savory dish. 

Cheese ScaUqp, — Soak a small cupful of stale browned 
bread crumbs in fresh milk ; beat into this one large egg, 
a teaspoonf ul of melted butter, three ounces of grated Par- 
mesan cheese ; pepper and salt to taste ; strew bread crumbs 
over all, and bake in scallop shells to a delicate brown. 

Ramdkins of Cheese. — Scrape a quarter of a pound each 
of Cheshire and Gloucestershire cheese and good fresh 
butter ; pound all in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs 
and the inside of a small French roll boiled in cream until 
soft ; mix this paste with a wineglassf ul of white wine and 
the whites of the eggs, which should be beaten as light as 
possible ; fill small oblong paper pans, and bake in a Dutch 
oven until of a fine brown ; send to table red-hot ; the 
batter for ramakins is equally good over macaroni when 
boiled tender, or on stewed broccoli, celery, or cauliflower; 
a little of the gravy they have been stewed in being put in 
the dish. 

Potted Cheese^ No. 1. — One pound of Cheshire cheese, 
and one of Gloucestershire ; three tablespoonfuls of moun- 
tain wine, and two of made mustard ; pound all together 
in a marble mortar, and then pack it into small jars for use. 

Potted Cheese^ No. 2. — Four ounces of Cheshire cheese, 
cut and pounded ; one and a half ounces of best butter ; one 
teaspoonf ul of white powdered sugar, a little bit of mace, 
and a glassful of white wine. 

Mix all smoothly together, and press down into a deep pot. 

Boasted Cheese^ Dutch Receipt, — Three ounces of fat 
Cheshire cheese grated, mixed with the beaten yolks of two 
eggs, four ounces of grated bread, and three ounces of 
butter. 



238 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Beat smooth in a mortar, with a deesertspoonfal of 
mustard, and salt and pepper ; spread very thickly upon 
squares of toasted bread ; put into a Dutch oven, covered 
with a dish until hot through ; remove the dish, and brown ; 
serve blazing hot. 

Cheeae Stirabout (Soyer). — Nearly fill an iron pot with 
water ; throw in three tablespoonf uls of salt ; when boil- 
ing, throw in by degrees some sifted Indian meal, in the 
proportion of one pound to every two quarts of water ; 
when well stirred, remove the husk w^hich floats on top, 
then throw in one pound of strong cheese, grated ; boil 
twenty minutes and serve* 

Cheese Eolls (Soyer). — Take sonie nice French rolls; 
cut off a piece of the crust, and pull out with a fork as much 
as possible of the inside without spoiling the shape of the 
roll ; fill up with Welsh rarebit ; put the top on and serve. 
This is an excellent picnic dish, as the rolls are good cold. 

Irish Rarebit (Soyer). — Four ounces of strong cheese ; 
one ounce of butter ; one gherkin chopped fine ; mustard, 
pepper, and salt to taste. 

Heat altogether; pour hot over rounds of toast; put 
in the oven five minutes, and serve hot. 

Cheese Straws^ No. 1. — Make some sheets of the finest 
puff paste ; roll them out very thin ; sprinkle lightly with 
salt and cayenne pepper ; then lay one on top of the other, 
and roll out again and again until the paste is nearly as 
thin as tissue paper, and is evenly salted and peppered ; 
cut then with a paste-cutter into tiny strips or straws about 
four inches long ; lay on buttered paper, and bake quickly ; 
arrange in a square pile like straws, and serve as cheese 
with olives. 

Cheese Straws^ No. 2. — Quarter of a pound of finest white 



CHEESE. 239 

flour, sifted; two ounces of good butter; two ounces of 
Parmesan cheese, grated ; two ounces of common cheese, 
grated ; a pinch of cayenne pepper. 

Mix flour and butter well and smoothly together ; add 
the cheese and cayenne ; work well ; roll out as for puflE 
paste ; cut in narrow strips, and bake. 

Mamequins de Dijon. — Half a tumbler of water ; one 
pinch of salt ; one pinch of white pepper ; half a coffee- 
spoonful of sugar; four to five ounces of fresh butter; 
half a pound of finest white flour, sifted ; four ounces of 
fresh Gruyere cheese, chopped fine ; five eggs, well beaten. 

Put the water, butter, sugar, salt, and pepper into a 
casserole ; when the mixture boils, withdraw it from the 
fire, and add the flour gradually; replace the casserole 
on the fire ; have it on the fire a few moments, stirring 
all the time ; then pour into another casserole, and add, 
little by little, the eggs and the cheese, stirring stead- 
ily; when the batter is stiff take out a dessertspoonful 
afe-a time, and arrange in little ovals on a buttered baking 
dish; glaze the ramequins with, beaten white of egg; 
place on each a small slice of Gruyere, cut in the form of 
a lozenge, and bake in a quick oven. 



EGGS. 

Egg8^ to Choose. — Try the eggs in a pan of cold water. 
The freshest sink first ; those that float are to be rejected. 
Or, shake the egg gently at your ear. If you hear a gur- 
gle or thud the egg is bad. 

Eggs should be kept in a cool place. If you wish to 
keep them for weeks, grease with linseed-oil, and pack in 
bran or coarse salt, with the small end downwards. 



Boiled Eggs, — Put into a saucepan of boiling water with 
a tablespoon, and boil steadily three minutes for soft eggs, 
ten for hard. 

Or, put them on in cold water, and boil ten minutes ; 
they will be then of the consistency of cream ; serve in a 
folded napkin. 

Pouched Eggs, — Strain some boiling water into a per- 
fectly clean saucepan ; when the water boils, break the 
eggs separately into a saucer, and slide each egg carefully 
upon the surface of the water (first removing the sauce- 
pan from the fire) ; when all the eggs are in, return the 
saucepan to the fire, and boil gently three minutes; have 
some rounds of buttered toast in a hot dish ; remove the 
eggs from the saucepan with a perforated skimmer, drain, 
and lay on the toast ; dust lightly with salt and white pep- 
per, and serve. 

Poached Eggs d, la Crime (" Common-Seilse in the 
Household "). — Poach as above, adding, however, a table- 



EGGS. 241 

spoonful of strained vinegar, and a pinch of salt to the 
water. Prepare a sauce with one teacupful of chicken 
broth, half a teacupful of cream, and one spoonful of but- 
ter. Let it heat to a boil, stirring constantly ; then add 
butter, pepper, and salt to taste ; boil up once, and pour 
over the eggs and toast ; dust lightly with powdered pars- 
ley, and serve. 

Baked Eggs. — Butter a deep dish, and break in six or 
more eggs very carefully ; place a piece of fresh butter ou 
each egg ; dust lightly with gait and pepper ; bake in the 
oven until the whites are set. 

ScaUoped Eggs. — Butter some scallop shells, and half 
fQl with a forcemeat made of equal parts of ground ham, 
cold chicken, and bread crumbs ; season with pepper and 
salt, and moisten with melted butter; break an egg care- 
fully on the top of each, dust with pepper and salt, and 
sift with finely grated bread crumbs; set in the oven 
and bake eight minutes. These are equally good made 
with dried beef grated, mixed \yith the yolk of hard- 
boiled egg rubbed to a powder. If you use the beef omit 
the chicken. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Put a good-sized piece of butter in a 
frying-pan, and when it is hot drop in the eggs and stir 
continually until they are cooked, which will be in about 
three minutes ; turn out on a hot dish, and eat at once. 

Stirred Eggs on Mounds. — ^Cut (with a cake-cutter) some 
white bread into rounds, toast on both sides, butter care- 
fully, and heap with ground ham, grated dried beef, or 
minced chicken ; then put a lump of butter into a fry- 
ing-pan, and when it is hot stir in four or five well-beat- 
en eggs, with pepper, salt, and a little powdered parsley ; 
stir and toss for five minutes, then heap on the mounds, 
and serve.

242 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Egg Baskets, — Boil some eggs Lard, cut them neatly in 
half lengthwise, and extract the yolks; rub these to a 
paste, and mix with some cold fowl or ham chopped fine ; 
mix smoothly together with melted butter ; then fill the 
hollowed whites with the mixture, arrange neatly in a 
very hot dish, and pour over them a rich gravy. 

Or, you can serve them cold with mayonncdae sauce. 

Soft Eggs with Anchovy Butter. — Choose eight large 
eggs, drop them carefully into hot water, and boil five 
minutes in a covered saucepan ; drain and drop into cold 
water in which they may grow cold; then remove the 
shell carefully, taking care not to break the whites ; drop 
the eggs again into hot water, leaving them just long 
enough to heat them ; then arrange them in a hot dish, 
and pour over them a sauce of melted butter thickened 
with anchovy paste. 

Eggs with Tomato Sa/uce. — Fry some eggs as round as 
balls ; then arrange them in a pyramid on a very hot dish, 
and pour over them a rich tomato sauce ; dust thickly with 
fried bread crumbs, and serve. 

Eggs oi la Parisienne. — Glaze some small moulds with 
a little good stock, and dust with fresh truffles chopped to 
the finest possible mince ; then break a fresh egg into each 
mould, dust with pepper and salt, and bake in the oven 
for six or seven minutes ; then turn out the moulds on a 
very hot dish, pour over them some lobster or shrimp sauce, 
and serve. 

Farcied Eggs. — ^Boil eight or ten eggs hard, cut them 
in half lengthwise, and rub the yolks to a powder ; work 
this to a paste with a little bread crumb, some anchovies 
pounded fine, and some melted butter, also a handful of 
fine herbs chopped to powder, and the yolks of one or two 
raw eggs ; season the whole with pepper and salt, and stuff 



EGGS. 24a 

the whites of the eggs ; then join them carefully, roll the 
egg first in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry 
them ; arrange in a pyramid, and garnish with fried pars- 
ley. 

Eggs d la Moutglas, — ^Boil some eggs for five minutes, 
then drop them into cold water ; twenty minutes af ter- 
wsirds drain them, remove the shells, and with a tube take 
out the yolks; fill the hollows with a moutglasy or fine 
mince, composed of chicken breast, scarlet tongue, and 
truffles, and bind with a little good sauce or stock ; close 
the opening, roll the eggs in beaten egg, and then in bread 
crumbs, and fry quickly. 

Jumhled Eggs with Shrimps. — Take four tablespoonf uls 
of cooked shrimps skinned and chopped ; pound the skins 
or shells to the finest possible powder, and rub smooth 
with some fresh butter ; then butter the bottom of a f ry- 
ing-pauj break eight eggs into a dish, beat very light, and 
season with salt, pepper, and a sowpqcm of cayenne ; pour 
the eggs into a buttered frying-pan, put the pan on the 
fire, and stir the eggs continually with a wooden spoon ; 
when they begin to harden, withdraw the pan from the 
fire and add (still stirring) two teaspoonfuls of rich cream, 
and the red butter cut into dice ; return the pan to the 
fire, and two minutes later add the chopped shrimps; stir, 
and pour into a hot dish. 

Plover^ s Eggs in a Nest of Butter. — Test plover^s as 
you would hen's eggs. If they are fresh, put eighteen or 
more carefully into a saucepan, cover with cold water, and 
cook slowly for eight or ten minutes ; then drain and drop 
into cold water. Meanwhile make some cornucopias of 
paper, fill them with soft, fresh butter, and press out the 
butter through the small end ; the butter will issue from 
this hole in a long, thin strip ; proceed in this way to form 
an imitation bird's nest on the border of a round plate ; 



244 'i'HE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

within this nest of butter arrange a pile of water-cresses, 
and pnt the eggs on this, so placing them as to form a 
pyramid; put the dish on ice until you are ready to 
serve it. 

Breaded Eggs. — Boil some eggs hard, remove the shells, 
and cut into thick slices ; dip each slice in beaten egg, and 
then in rolled bread crumbs, and fry quickly in boiling 
lard ; garnish with fried parsley, and serve. 

Eggs au Lit. — Mince some cold corned beef, ham, or 
fowl very fine, and add two beaten eggs and some melted 
butter, pepper, salt, and minced parsley ; warm in a fry- 
ing-pan, stirring and tossing continually ; when thoroughly 
heated through arrange in a thick layer on an oval dish, 
and place on the mince as many poached eggs as they will 
hold ; dust with pepper and salt, and surround the base of 
the mound with triangles of fried bread. This is simpler 
and equally good if the mince be composed only of equal 
quantities of cold corned beef and boiled potatoes. 

Fricasseed Eggs. — Prepare some stuffed eggs as directed 
in any of the foregoing receipts, but cutting the eggs dif- 
ferently — that is, taking a slice off the top, which you may 
replace when you have filled the egg ; then arrange the 
stuffed eggs in a very hot dish, dust them thickly with 
roasted powdered parsley and fried bread crumbs, and 
then pour over them a sauce made in the following man- 
ner : Two cupf uls of strong veal or chicken broth, six ta- 
blespoonf uls of rich, fresh cream, salt and pepper to taste. 
Boil up, pour smoking hot over the eggs, let them stand 
five minutes closely covered, and send to table. 

Eggs Fried as Round as Balls (receipt of 1794:). — Have 
a very deep frying-pan with three pints of clarified butter; 
heat the butter hot, as for fritters, and stir it with a stick 
until it runs round like a whirlpool ; break an egg in the 



EGGS. 245 

middle, and turn it rohnd witli your stick until it is as hard 
as a poached egg. The whirling round of the butter will 
make it as round as a ball. Then take it up with a skim- 
mer, and put it into a dish before the fire. They will keep 
hot half an hour, and yet be soft ; so you may do as many 
as you please. Eggs may be poached round in boiling 
water in the same manner. 

Eggs Boasted in their Shells. — To be properly roasted, 
eggs should be roasted in sand. This, of course, is easily 
done ou^of -doors, but may be imitated in-doors by having 
a deep pan filled with sand, placed on the range, or, better 
still, in the oven. When the sand is thoroughly heated 
through, put a shovelful of red-hot wood coals on the sand, 
set the pan on the range, and after a few moments scrape 
the embers aside and some of the surface sand ; have the 
eggs pricked in the small end by a pin or sharp-pointed 
penknife to prevent bursting ; set each egg on end in the 
hot sand, and cover them with leaves, and then with the 
hot sand and embers; roast eight minates. Th^y will be 
as smooth as velvet. 

PicJded Eggs.—Bo\\ the eggs until they become per- 
fectly hard ; then remove the shells and lay them care- 
fully in a large-mouthed jar ; pour over them boiling vin- 
egar well seasoned with salt, peppercorns, allspice, mace, 
ginger, cayenne, mustard seed, a few cloves of garlic, and 
a tablespoonful of curry; when cold fasten the mouth 
of the jar very closely. In a month they will be fit for 
use. 

Parvrdhms. — Take some little earthen pans, such as are 
sold for toy milkpans, capable of holding one egg only ; 
heat them in the oven, and when quite hot take them 
out, and with a pastebrush butter them inside ; break an 
egg carefully into each pan ; set them in the oven until the 
white of the ^^'^ is hard enough to retain the form of the 



246 THE UNRIVALUBID COOK BOOK 

^ pan ; turn them' out in a circle on the dish in which they 
are to be served; on the top of each sprinkle a little 
fresh parsley or grated ham ; have ready a sance of bread 
crumbs, beaten np with rich gravy, browned and seasoned; 
place this in the middle of the dish, the eggs enclos- 
ing it. 

Wisconsm Eggs, — Beat twelve eggs well, and add two 
tablespoonfuls of cream and some salt ; have a lump of 
butter boiling in the frying-pan, and pour the mixture into 
it ; as fast as the Qgg cooks at the bottom, slip a knife 
under, tilting the pan a little so as to let the raw egg run 
towards the butter; when it forms a little, cut it in 
pieces as you would a pie, so that the xmcooked egg runs 
over the edges, for it must be cooked only on one side ; 
when done, add black pepper. This will fill a large dish. 

Puffed Eggs (Italian monastery). — Twelve eggs ; the 
yolks whole; the whites beaten to the stiffest possible 
froth. . 

Put a sufficient piece of butter in a frying-pan, and 
when it is melted and slightly browned put in the yolk of 
one egg ; do this carefully, so as not to break the yolk ; 
immedi^ely cover the yolk with a heaping spoonful of 
the beaten whites ; when cooked, remove the eggs with 
a perforated ladle, put them on a hot plate, and pour over 
them a ssmq^ piquante. 

Eggs al Piatto. — Six eggs beaten very light, yolks and 
whites together ; six slices of bread cut round and toasted 
on both sides ; some fresh cottage cheese. 

Put a piece of butter into a frying-pan, and when it is 
quite melted put in the pieces of toast, spread thickly 
with cottage cheese; pour over them immediately the 
beaten egg, and the moment the egg browns transfer the 
jpiatti to a hot plate ; sprinkle them with browned bread 
crumbs, and serve.

JEggs d la VaUombrosa. — Six eggs boiled hard and cat 
in half ; the yolks of four eggs beaten very light ; three 
button onions sliced jfine ; half a tumbler of fresh cream ; 
two tablespoonf uls of roasted parsley powdered fine ; salt 
and pepper to taste; a pinch of grated nutmeg; half a 
coflfeecupful of browned and rolled bread crumbs. 

Put a good-sized piece of butter into a porcelain-lined 
stewpan with the button onions; when the onions are 
nicely browned, add the cream, stirring all the time ; then 
drop in the hard-boiled eggs, and one minute later the 
beaten yolks ; sift the parsley in carefully, stirring all the 
time; then the nutmeg and the seasoning; serve on a 
very hot dish, and squeeze some lemon-juice over the vaJr 
lombrose before sending it to table. 

Eggs with Truffles. — Stew some finely sliced truffles 
with a little butter and milk ; have ready some good ham, 
sliced as thinly as possible and freed from fat ; fry the 
ham in butter, and when cooked put it on the plate in 
which you intend to serve the eggs (a strong eai*thenware 
plate is best), pouring over it a tablespoonful of good 
stock and the same quantity of white wine ; put the plate 
on an iron tripod over the fire, and when the sauce begins 
to boil break the eggs very carefully; the moment the 
eggs are cooked, take the plate from the tripod, pour the 
truffle sauce over the eggs, and serve. 

Snow Eggs. — The whites of eight eggs beaten to the 
stiffest possible froth; the yolks the same; one pint of 
fresh milk flavored with orange-flower water and a little 
grated rind of lemon; powdered sugar to taste, beaten 
into the whites of the eggs. 

Boil the milk, adding the flavoring when the milk is 
scalding-hot ; when the milk is boiling, drop in the whites 
in large spoonfuls, turning them over carefully to facili- 
tate their swelling ; when they are cooked, pile the balls 
of snow into a dish and set asid« ; strain the milk through 



248 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK 

a sieve, sweeten to taste, and pour it on the beaten yolks ; 
return the sancepan to the fire, stirring the mixture con- 
tinually until it assumes the consistency of cream ; then 
withdraw it from the fire, and pour the custard over the 
snow pyramid ; eat hot or cold to taste.

hot oyer four hard-boiled eggs, cut in thick slices ; it is 
best to cut the eggs and arrange them neatly in a very hot 
dish, with a garland of water-cress round them and thin 
slices of lemon ; then, at the last moment, pour over the 
boiling sauce, and serve at once. 

Devilled Eggs, — Boil the eggs hard, remove the shells, 
and cut the eggs in half, slicing a bit off the bottoms to 
make them stand upright, d la Columbus; extract the 
yolks, and rub to a smooth paste with melted butter, cay- 
enne pepper, a touch of mustard, and a dash of vinegar ; 
fill the hollowed whites with this, and send to table upon 



EGGS. 249

light the lamp under the chafing-dish, and stir the mixt- 
ure continually with a wooden spoon, adding meanwhile 
a little salt and cayenne. 

Omdette au Thun (Brillat Savarin). — Take, for six per- 
sons, the roes of two carp, bleach them by throwing them 
for a moment into boiling salted water ; take a piece of 
fresh tunny the size of a hen's ^^g^ to which add a small 
chopped onion ; hash up the roe, onion, and tunny well 
together, and throw them into a saucepan with a sufficient 
piece of very good butter ; stir continually until the but- 
ter is melted ; take a second piece of butter and mix it 
thoroughly with minced parsley and chives ; squeeze the 
juice of a lemon over it, and place it in the dish destined 
to receive the omelette, which you must then place in the 
oven, so that the dish may be thoroughly heated, and the 
butter thoroughly melted, by the time the omelette is 
done ; then beat up very thoroughly twelve fresh eggs ; 
add the saute^ roe, and tunny, stirring furiously to mix all 
together, and proceed to make and cook the omelet as 
usual, endeavoring to turn it out long, thick, and soft. 
" A dish to be reserved for amateurs who know how to 
eat " (Brillat Savarin). 

Truffled Eggs. — Beat four eggs in a dish with a little 
cream and a pinch of salt ; chop up a truffle very fine, add 
this to the eggs and pour into your saucepan, stirring un-

the yolks caref tUy, leaving them whole ; cut the whites 
into thin strips, and arrange them on a dish in the form 
of a bird's-nest ; have ready 2k puree of spinach, with which 
fill up the nest ; on this arrange the yolks in a pyramid ; 
pour over all a rich white sauce and serve. 

Hunter's Omelet. — Beat ten or twelve eggs light, and 
season them with salt and pepper, and, if you choose, a 
very little nutmeg ; butter, some little pannikins, and fill 
each with the beaten egg ; cook the little omelets care- 
fully, browning both sides, then turn them out on a plate, 
and when cold spread them thickly with anchovy butter, 
and pile one on the other. These omelets are very nice 
for a journey, or hunting and fishing expeditions. 

Omelets d la Lyomiaise. — Put a large lump of butter 
in a frying or an omelet pan; then beat eight eggs as 
light as possible, seasoning them with pepper, salt, and a 
pinch of grated Parmesan cheese; when they are as light 
as they can be, and the butter melted, pour the eggs into 
the omelet-pan, and shake the pan in such a way that the

arately and to the very utmost; one smsdl cupful of rich 
milk. 

When the yolks are beaten thick add the milk, and beat 
hard and long ; then add the beaten whites, and pepper 
and salt ; have ready a large lump of butter in a hot fry- 
ing-pan ; when the butter hisses, pour in the omelet and 
cook ten minutes over a clear fire ; do not stir the omelet, 
but watch carefully and slip a spatula or broad-bladed

MILK AND BUTTER. 

GENERAL BULES FOB ATTENDISO TO MILX AND BUTTEB. 

Keep in a cool cellar, dairy, or milk-room. Allow no 
strongly flavored substances to be in the neighborhood of 
milk or butter. •Place upon swing shelves. Use broad, 
shallow earthenware pans if you can get them ; if not, tin 
pans made in one piece ; keep pans, jarSjCrocks, and churn 
exquisitely clean and fresh, scalding and airing persistently 
and continually ; scald your pans always a short time bo- 
fore straining the milk into them ; then set the pans on 
swing shelves, and in twelve hours skim for the table ; 
then let it stand twelve hours more for the second rising 
of the cream ; put this into the stone jar or crock in which 
the cream is kept for churning. It is always worth while 
to do this, as the second rising of cream repays the trouble. 
As soon as the cream " loppers," or thickens, chum. 

Fresh Butter. — Scald the churn thoroughly, then cool as 
thoroughly with ice or spring water, then pour in the thick 
cream ; churn fast at first, then, as the butter forms, more 
slowly, always with perfect regularity ; in warm weather 
pour a little cold water into the churn, should the butter 
form slowly ; take it up with the perforated dasher, turning 
it dexterously just below the surface of the buttennilk, to 
catch every stray bit ; have ready some clear, very cold water, 
in a deep wooden tray, and into this plunge the dasher when 
you draw it from the churn ; the butter will float oflE, leav- 
ing the dasher free. When you have collected all the but- 
ter, gather behind a wooden butter shovel, and drain oflE the 
water, squeezing and pressing the butter with the shovel ; 



254 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Bet in a cool place, for an hour, to hardcD, then work and 
knead it until not another drop of water exudes, and the 
butter is perfectly smooth and close in texture and polish ; 
then with the paddle make up into rolls, little balls, 
stamped pats, etc. 

Salt Butter, — Proceed precisely as above, but when you 
have worked out the buttermilk, add by degrees fine salt, 
in the proportion of a dessertspoonful to every pound ; 
then set aside for some hours, always in a cool place ; then 
mould as above. Wrap each roll in a clean, wet linen cloth, 
with no touch of soap or starch about it, and pack in a 
fitone jar, sprinkling a little salt between the layers. 

8(dt Butter J to Keep. — ^Work with special care, and pack 
down hard in a perfectly clean stone jar ; it must be a fresh 
jar, one never before used ; press a fine linen cloth closely 
to the surface, and cover this with a thick layer of clean, 
fine salt ; set in a cool, dry place, and keep closely covered. 

Bennet. — The stomach of a fresh -killed calf, well 
cleaned, and scoured inside and out with salt ; when per- 
fectly clean, tack upon a frame to dry in the sun for a 
day ; cut in squares, pack down in salt, and keep in wine 
or brandy ; when you wish to use the salted, soak half an 
hour in cold water, wash well, and put into the milk to be 
turned, tied to a string, so that you may draw it out with- 
out breaking the curd. Sometimes the dried and salted 
rennet may be bought in the markets and drug shops. 
Bottled rennet is also sold in the drug shops. 

Vrai Fromage d la Crimea No. 1, or Fromage de Chamr 
tilVy. — One quart of very rich cream, two or three days 
old ; a pinch of gum arabic, powdered fine. 

Put into an earthenware bowl, which you have sur- 
rounded with pounded ice, and a handful of salt ; whip the 
cream hard and long, until it is as smooth as velvet ; then 



MILK AND BUTTER. 255 

add a little powdered sugar, whipping it in gradually ; then 
put into a wicker basket {or panier defromage). It should 
be heart-shaped, and lined with a coarse linen cloth. Place 
this in a deep earthenware dish, being careful to put little 
pieces of wood, an inch thick, under the panier defromage^ 
so as to raise it a little ; put the earthenware dish in the re- 
frigerator ; when ready to serve, turn out i^efromage on a 
deep dish ; smother -^iih fresh cream, and serve. This is 
the g&amxiQ fromage d la crime of the Parisian street cries. 

Fromage d, la Crimea No. 2, or Fromage de Yi/ry, — One 
half quantity of whipped cream as above ; one half quan- 
tity of plain cream cheese. 

Mix to a smooth cream, whip to velvet, whip in sugar 
to taste, and on^ d/rop essence of bitter almonds ; then pro- 
ceed as above. 

Fromage d la Crimey No. 8. — One quart of fresh rich 
milk, heated to tepid warmth ; a piece of rennet as large 
as a pea, dissolved in the milk. 

Put in a covered vessel on the hot coals ; when the milk 
is turned, put into a heart-shaped wicker basket, lined with 
coarse linen. When it has well drained, put into a deep 
dish, smother in rich, fresh cream, dust with fine sugar, 
and serve. 

Old Virginia Oream Cheese. — Put aside a quart of good 
cream until it is sour, and very thick, and stir into it a 
tablespoonful of salt ; lay a piece of thin muslin on a hair 
sieve, so as to draw the cheese out in the muslin. Put a 
sieve on a dish, pour in the cream, and let it drain for 
three days, pouring off the whey every morning. If the 
cream will not go in all at once, add it during the day, as 
the whey sinks. It should be of the consistency of butter 
when eaten. Put into a large heart-shaped tin mould to 
press. The bottom of the mould should be pierced with 
round holes, and should stand on little feet, so that the 



256 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK 

cheese may drain while pressing. Eat with sweet cream 
and sngar. 

Nem Jersey Oream Cheese. — Scald the milk, and let it 
cool a little before putting in the rennet. When the curd 
is formed, take it out on a ladle without breaking it; lay 
it on a thin cloth held by two persons ; dash a ladleful of 
water over each ladleful of curd, to separate the curd; 
hang it up to drain the water off, and then put it under a 
light press for one hour ; cut the curd with a thread into 
small pieces ; lay a cloth between each two, and press for 
an hour ; take them out, rub them with fine salt, let them 
lie on a board for an hour, and wash them in cold water ; 
let them lie to drain, and in a day or two the skin will look 
dry; put some sweet grass under and over them^and they 
will soon ripen. 

Neufchatd Cheese. — Stir a little salt into a pan of lop- 
pered cream ; pour into a linen bag, and let it drain three 
days, changing the bag every day ; then pack into a 
wooden mould with holes in the bottom, and press two 
hours ; wet the mould in cold water before putting in the 
cream curd; wrap each cheese in several folds of soft, 
white tissue paper, and put into a cool place. Thus ar- 
ranged, these cheeses will keep for a week. 

Cottage or Pot Cheese. — Heat sour milk until the whey 
rises to the top ; pour it off, put the curd in a hag, and 
let it drip six hours without squeezing it; put into a 
wooden bowl, chop fine with a wooden spoon, salt to taste, 
and work to the consistency of soft putty, adding a little 
cream and butter as you proceed. Mould with your hands 
into round balls, and keep in a cool place. Pot-cheese 
should be eaten fresh. It is delicious with brown bread 
and fresh butter, and just a little sowpqon of red pepper. 

Jv/nket^ or Slip amd Oo Bovm— One quart of rich milk; 



MILK AND BUTTEB. 257 

one piece of rennet, or a teaspoonful of the wine in 
which the rennet is kept, to each quart of milk ; one ta- 
blespoonf ul of powdered sugar to each quart ; a little nut- 
meg. 

Cover closely, and set in a very warm place for an hour. 
If by that time there are no signs of stiffening, add more 
rennet. When it is as firm as hlanc-mange^ and before the 
whey separates, remove the rennet ; then set the junket 
upon ice until wanted ; dust lightly with finely grated nut- 
meg, and eat with powdered sugar and cream. 

Bonny Cldbber^ or Loppered Milk. — Set a dish of 
skimmed milk away in a warm place, closely covered ; 
when it turns, i, ^., becomes smooth and firm like Uanc- 
mange^ serve in the same dish ; grate a little nutmeg over 
it, and eat with powdered sugar and cream. 

Thickened Milk. — One quart of milk ; a pinch of salt ; 
two tablespoonfuls of rice flour wet in cold milk. 

Stir smoothly the rice flour into the boiling milk, and let 
it thicken in a vessel placed in a pan of boiling water, keep- 
ing the water at a hard boil for an hour ; stir continually, 
or it will not be quite smooth. 

Staffordshire Syllabub. — One pint of cider ; one wine- 
glassful of brandy ; sugar to taste ; a pinch of nutmeg. 

Put into a very deep bowl ; stir well until the sugar is 
thoroughly dissolved ; then fasten a fine hair sieve over 
the bowl, and milk into it. This is the genuine, far-famed 
Staffordshire syllabub. 

Somersetshire Syllahvb. — In a large china bowl put a 
pint of port and a pint of sherry ; sugar to taste ; milk 
the bowl full. 

In twenty minutes' time cover it pretty high with 
clotted cream ; grate nutmeg over it ; put also some pow- 
dered cinnamon and nonpareil comfits. 



258 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Posset SyUahuh — ^Mix a quart of thick cream with one 
ponnd of lump sugar, and a pint of white wine ; rub a 
few lumps of sugar on the rind of two or three lemons to 
extract the essence ; pour upon them the juice of three 
lemons; add this to the cream and whisk one way until 
thick. 

Devonshire Clotted Cream. — That made from the milk 
of the Alderney or Guernsey cow is the richest, apparently 
irrespective of pasture. The milk of one day is scalded 
on the next. It is best to scald it over hot water. The 
milk-pans should be of tin, round, about forty-two inches 
in circumference at the top, and five inches deep. They 
should fit on another pan which holds the hot water and 
stands on the stove ; it takes about half an hour to scald 
the cream, the water in the under tin being kept boiling. 

Devonshire Cream Curds. — Seven eggs; three gills of 
water ; three pints of milk ; one gill of rich cream ; one 
tablespoonful of the best vinegar. 

Put all in a stewpan over the fire^ and let it boil two 
or three minutes to separate the curd. Eat cold, with 
fruit and sugar. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, MUFFINS, ETC. 

GENEBAL DIBECTIONS FOB MAKING BREAD. 

Buy new flour if possible ; it takes up more water than 
the old and yields a larger amount of bread. A pint of 
milk in a batch of four loaves of bread gives you a pound 
more bread of better quality, and helps to keep it moist. 
One pound of pea meal, or ground split pease, added to 
every fourteen pounds of flour, increases its nourishment. 
When bread is too stale to eat or to make into bread broth, 
dry it in a cool oven, or over the top of the fire ; roll it 
with a rolling pin ; sift through a sieve, and put into a 
wide-mouthed and closely covered glass jar; keep in a 
dry place, and use for breading fish, chops, croquettes, etc. 
If you have a whole stale loaf, put it into a tightly covered 
tin can and steam it, or put it into a moderately warm oven 
for half an hour. It will then be quite as palatable as 
fresh bread* 

Flour ^ to Choose. — Flour should be fine, dry, elastic, 
odorless, and tasteless. It should not have even a suspi- 
cion of mustiness or acidity. It should not be moist, nor 
retain the impress of your palm and fingers if you squeeze 
it into a ball. Nor, as you run it through your fingers, 
should it feel musty, damp, or glutinous, but light, dry, 
and almost impalpable. 

Yeasty to Choose. — Should be light in color, lively, ef- 
fervescing easily when shaken, and emitting an odor like 
weak ammonia. If dull or sour it is not fit to use. - 



260 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Yeast without Hops. — This yeast is desirable, as it never 
tastes bitter, even in hot cakes. Five large potatoes, grated ; 
one quart of boiling water ; one teaenpf ul of yeast ; one 
teacupful of brown sugar ; one tablespoonful of salt. 

Add the potatoes when grated to the quart of boiling 
water ; boil five minutes, then remove it from the fire, 
and add the teacupful of brown sugar and the tablespoon- 
ful of salt. When it cools, add the yeast. 

Potaio Yeast. — Twelve good -sized potatoes, peeled, 
boiled, and mashed ; one handful of hops, boiled in a quart 
of water; one cupful of brown sugar; half a cupful of 
salt ; one cupful of good yeast. 

Measure the hop tea when done, and pour it on the 
mashed potatoes. Measure the water in which the pota- 
toes were boiled, and then, from a kettle of boiling water, 
make up what is wanting of a gallon of fluid ; add the 
brown sugar and the salt; let it stand until lukewarm, 
and then add the yeast; set it to rise for twenty -four 
hours. This yeast will ferment like beer. 

Sponge made of the Above. — Mash a hot boiled potato ; 
mix it with about two quarts of flour, and two large kitch- 
enspoonf uls of the yeast ; beat it well, and set it to rise 
about one p.m. ; about seven, make up the bread with this 
sponge. 

Yeast for Bread (Pennsylvania receipt). — Two quarts 
of very strong hop tea; six good -sized white potatoes, 
mashed through a sieve ; half a teacupful of finest white 
flour, sifted ; half a teacupful of salt ; one teacupful of 
sugar. 

Beat this mixture until quite smooth, and let it boil up 
once; when cold, add a piece of leaven or some yeast to 
set it going, and bottle and cork it tight ; shake it well 
before using it. For bread, take two tablespoonfuls to 
each quart of flour. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, MUFFINS, ETC. 261 

Bread — General Rules, — Imprimis^ use none but' the 
best flour ; sift all white flour well and thoroughly. 

2. Mix the dough as soft as it can be handled. 

3. Set the dough to rise in a moderately warm place, 
and keep it at an even temperature. If by any accident 
you should find your dough puffy and sour, dissolve a little 
soda or saleratus in hot water, and work it well in. 

4. Knead the bread faithfully ^nd from all sides, until 
it rebounds like an India-rubber ball from a smart blow 
of the fist on the centre of the mass. 

5. The oven should not be too hot, and the heat should 
be perfectly steady after the bread goes in. If you cannot 
hold your bare arm in the oven while you count thirty, 
the oven is too hot to bake bread. 

6. Grease your pans well before putting in the bread. 

7. When you take the bread from the oven, turn out 
from the pan, and stand each loaf upright on edge ; the 
lower part resting on the table, the upper supported by 
some upright object. Throw a clean, dry, light cloth over 
all. Do not put away until quite cold. Then keep in a 
tin bread box, folded in clean cloths. 

Bread Sponge (Mary Anne's).— Six potatoes, peeled, 
boiled, and mashed fine while hot ; six tablespoonf uls of 
baker's yeast; two tablespoonf uls of white sugar; two 
tablespoonf uls of lard ; one teaspoonf ul of soda ; one quart 
of warm water ; three cups of finest white fiour, sifted. 

Mash the potatoes, and work in the lard and sugar. 
Work to a cream, mixing in gradually a quart of the water 
in which the potatoes were boiled. This water should be 
used blood-warm. Beat in the fiour smoothly, then the 
yeast, lastly the soda. Cover lightly if the weather is 
warm ; more closely in winter, and set to rise overnight 
in a warm place. 

Family Breads White, No. 1 (Mary Anne's). — For the 
above sponge, sift two quarts and a pint of fiour into the 



262 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

bread-tray ; sift with the flour three teaspoonf uls of fine Bait ; 
make a hole in the middle of the heap ; pour in the risen 
sponge; flour your hands thoroughly, and work down the 
flour into the sponge with your hands. If you can mould 
it at all, it is not too soft. If too stiff, rinse out the bowl 
in which the sponge was set with a little lukewarm water, 
and work this well in. As soon as you have the dough in 
manageable shape, begin to knead, and knead steadily for 
half an hour at least ; knead always towards the centre of 
the mass, turning it repeatedly over and over, and round 
and round, that no portion may escape manipulation ; lift 
the dough from the tray in your left hand, while with 
your right you sprinkle flour thickly over the bottom and 
sides of the tray ; toss back the dough, and knead and turn 
as before. When the half -hour is up, form the dough into 
around ball ; sprinkle flour on the top ; place in the centre 
of the kneading-tray ; cover with a clean cloth, and leave 
on the kitchen table to rise, taking care it is not in a 
draught of cold air. It will need four or five hours to rise 
in summer, and six in winter. The dough will in that 
time treble its original bulk. Then knead again for fifteen 
minutes; divide into loaves; prick each with a fork; put 
into greased pans ; cover with a clean cloth, and leave for 
an hour. Then bake, following the directions given above 
for baking. One hour in a good oven ought to be enough 
for the above quantity. 

Family Breads Whiter No. 2 (Old Humphrey). — Four 
quarts of finest wheat flour, sifted ; one quart of milk-warm 
water ; half a pint of baker's yeast ; one tablespoonf ul of salt. 

Dissolve the salt in the water, and add the yeast ; put 
the flour into a kneading-bowl ; make a hollow in the 
middle of the flour, and pour the yeast and water into it, 
leaving a wall of the dry flour around it, after beating it 
well; then place the pan in a warm, dry place, in the 
kitchen, if it be winter. In warm weather, a cooler place 
must be selected. Cover it well, and let it stand all night ; 



BEEAD, BISCUIT, MUFFINS, ETC. 263 

this must be done before bedtime. About eight or nine 
o'clock the next morning the dongh will have risen, and cov- 
ered nearly all the flour on the sides ; then knead in the flour 
until the dough is soft, and easily kneaded ; take it out of 
the pan, and knead it thoroughly on the paste-board ; then 
cut into three or four pieces, and knead each by itself ; lay 
each piece in a buttered baking-pan ; set them in a warm 
place for two or three hours ; they must rise nearly to the 
top of the pans ; bake them for about half an hour ; keep 
the oven closed for ten or fifteen minutes before venturing 
to open the door. If an oven heated by wood is used, the 
bread will require nearly double the time.

Old-fashioned Short Bread, — One pound of the finest 
white flour, dried and sifted ; quarter of a pound of but- 
ter; quarter of a pound of lard; one saltspoonful of salt; 
a pinch of soda, thoroughly dissolved in just enough vine- 
gar to cover it, and well worked in ; enough ice-water to 
enable you to roll out into j^aste half an inch thick.

tablespoonfuls of lard; three tablespoonfuls of butter; 
two and a half cupfuls of loppered cream ; two eggs well 
beaten; one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water; 
one teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix this short cake as soft as you can roll it ; chop up 
the shortening in the salted flour, as for pastry ; add the 
eggs and soda to the milk; put all together, handling as 
little as possible; roll lightly and rapidly into two sheets — 
the one intended for the upper crust fully half an inch 
thick, the lower somewhat less ; lay the lower in a frell- 
greased baking-pan ; spread thickly over it whatever fresh 
fruit you prefer, sprinkle sugar over the fruit, cover with 
the thicker crust, and bake from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes ; eat hot with butter and sugar.

this short cake is to be baked round in jelly-cake tins, one 
round of paste piled upon another; while warm separate 
them ; put alternate rounds of short cake and fresh straw- 
berries, the latter sprinkled with sugar, until you have a 
pile higher than a " Sally Lunn ;" eat cold with cream.

GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

GENEBAL DIRECTIONB. 

Always bake griddle-cakes upon a soapstone griddle. 
Never allow the smallest drop of grease to fall upon a 
soapstone griddle, as it will spoil it for future use. If, 
however, you happen to be where soapstone griddles are 
not to be had, wash your iron griddle well with soap and 
water, dry thoroughly with a clean cloth, and then rub 
well with dry salt. Wipe ofiP, heat the griddle, and grease 
with a piece of fat salt pork on a fork. Put on as little 
fat as possible. Test the griddle at first with a single 
cake. Turn the cakes always with a tin spatula, not with 
a knife. In preparing the batter for any griddle-cakes, 
beat it hard and long. This will make the cakes not only 
smooth, but light. 

Buchmheat Cakes^ No. 1. — Three quarts of water as warm 
as the hand can bear it (i. ^.^ in winter) ; enough buck- 
wheat meal to thicken the batter. 

Beat it well until it is as smooth as velvet ; add salt, 
and a teacupf ul of good fresh yeast ; then beat again ; 
cover the crock with a towel, and let it stand in a warm 
place — if the weather be cold, not far from the fire ; in 
eight or ten hours it will be ready for use ; the batter, 
when risen, should be so light and spongy that the cakes 
will rise quite thick; bake a fine brown on hoik sides; 
serve instantly on a hot plate. Remember that thin buck- 
wheat cakes are not so good. The above quantity is 
enough for ten persons.

then thicken it smoothly with flour; let it remain a short 
time on the fire, stirring steadily all the time, then pour 
into a bowl, and mix with it six eggs beaten very light; 
beat the batter hard and long; fry in a deep saucepan, 
stirring the butter or lard hard until it whirls ; then drop 
in the fritters by spoonfuls, and fry as round as balls. 

Thanksgiving Fritters. — One quart of rich milk; six 
eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately and very light ; 
three cupfuls of flour sifted ; half a teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in hot water ; one teaspoonful of cream of tar- 
tar sifted into the flour ; a little salt. 

Beat the milk into the already beaten yolks, then add in 
order the soda, the flour, and salt, finally the whites ; beat 
very hard, and when just ready to fry beat in some apple 
prepared as follows: Six large juicy apples pared, cut into 
thin quarters or eighths, and stewed in a covered saucepan 
with one wineglassful of brandy, one tablespoonful of

dry ; one cupful of boiling milk ; four eggs, whites and 
yolks beaten separately ; two tablespoonf uls of powdered 
sugar ; one teaspoonful of corn-starch moistened with cold 
milk ; three tablespoonf uls of currant jelly. 



296 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK.

corn-starch; heat all together to a boil, stirring steadily; 
beat the yolks light, and when the custard cools whip in 
the beaten yolks, the sugar, jelly, and beaten whites ; fry 
as round as balls. 

Bmdettes. — Three eggs; three tablespoonfuls of sour 
cream ; one spoonful of butter ; one pinch of salt.

any berries. 

Paste for Fritters. — ^Put some flour in a dish ; make a 
hole in the centre and break in one or two yolks of eggs ; 
a spoonful of olive-oil, and one tablespoonful of brandy ; 
a pinch of salt ; stir it always in the same direction, add- 
ing by degrees a little water, to make it the proper con- 
sistency ; just before you need it, stir in the white of the 
egg, beaten very stifiP. It is best to prepare it the evening 
before ; it becomes lighter. If it is for sweet fritters, put 
very little salt, and add a little orange-flower water.

in this way. 



CAKE. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Cake will not rise if the oven is too slow ; but, on the 
other hand, if the oven be too hot, the cake burns on the 
outside. A large fruit-cake needs a very slow, steady fire. 
Small cakes baked in tins or pans do not need so hot a 
fire as large cakes. Where a great deal of molasses or su- 
gar is used, a more moderate fire than for pound or sponge 
cake is necessary. A good way to test the oven is to drop 
a little flour on the bottom of it. If it browns, the oven 
will be hot enough. 

Large cakes snould be baked in earthen pans; metal 
pans heat too quickly, and are apt to burn the cake. It 
is well always to have a paper at the bottom of the pan. 
While baking, if it is doing too fast on the top, spread a 
paper over it. 

Eaisins must always be stoned, and currants well washed 
and picked. Currants require many waters, and, in rins- 
ing, a stream should run upon them through a colander. * 
When washed, place a towel on a waiter, and spread the 
currants on it, rubbing them to and fro ; remove them to 
another towel and rub again ; then put them in a dish, 
and pick them over carefully. 

In using baking-powders, mix them with the flour. 
These powders should be made use of with discretion^ as 
they are apt to impart an alkaline flavor. 

Flour should be dry, and sifted through a hair sieve. 

The yolks and whites of eggs should be beaten sepa- 
rately, and the whites to the stifiPest froth. Stale and fresh 
eggs should never be used in the same cake. 

13* 



298 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Good butter should always be used for cake. 

It is best not to move cake after it is once in the oven. 

Also, be careful not to let in a stream of cold air when 
you open the oven door. 

In testing a cake to see if it is baked enough, run a 
broom splint or skewer through it. If it is not done 
enough, some of the dough will adhere to it; if done, it 
will come out clean. 

Cakes that are fried must be plunged^ into deep vessels 
of boiling lard. Try the lard first with a small piece of 
dough. Drop the cakes in ; as they brown on the under 
side, turn them over with a skimmer. Let them be laid 
on paper in the bottom of a dish, when taken from the hot 
lard, that the grease may be absorbed. 



Dream Cake. — Three quarters of a cupful of butter; 
two cupfnis of sugar, sifted; half a cupful of milk; two 
and a lialf cupfuls of pastrj' flour; half a teaspoonful of

whites of eight eggs beaten stiff ; one teaspoonful of al- 
mond extract. 

Mix the soda and cream of tartar with the flour ; rub 
the butter to a cream ; add the sugar and beat again ; add 
the milk and flour alternately, a little at a time, and beat 
well ; lastl}'-, add the beaten whites and the almond ; bake 
in three shallow pans. 

Make a frosting as follows : The whites of three eggs ; 
three cupfuls of confectioner's sugar, sifted. 

Put the eggs in a large bowl, sprinkle with three tea- 
spoonfuls of sugar, beat with a perforated spoon, and add 
three teaspoonf uls of sugar every five minutes ; then di- 
vide into three parts ; leave one white, and flavor it with 
almond or vanilla; color another pink, and flavor it with 
rose ; color another yellow, and flavor it with orange or 
lemon ; then put a layer of icing at least an inch thick on 
each cake ; put them together, ice all over again lightly 
with white icing, and sprinkle with grated cocoanut. 



CAKE. 299 

To color the pink icing U8e cochineal, adding it slowly

filling a delicate green with essence of spinach ; when the 
cake is properly arranged and filled, ice it completely with

Eat cold. This is a delicious tea-cake, cut in slices and 
buttered. 



PASTRY. 

OENKRAL DIRECTIONB. 

1, Use none but the best materials. The finest white 
flour, sifted through a hair sieve, in every stage of the 
process of paste-making. The best fresh butter ; or the 
best salt butter, washed carefully through several clear, 
cold waters, and kneaded under water to extract the salt. 
The butter should be hard and cool. The best lard, firm 
and sweet. The freshest of eggs. 

2. Handle all paste as little as possible. 

3, Make it in a cool place. 

4. Let your moulding-board be a marble slab, or a board 
of hard wood, clean, smooth, and kept for this purpose 
alone. 

The oven ought to be ready when the paste is begun. 
The heat should be perfectly steady and even ; i. e,y as 
great at the bottom as at the top. 

Puff paste requires a quick oven. Paste less rich and 
filled with fruit requires a moderate oven. In all pies in 
which it is necessary to thicken the juice, a teaspoonful 
of corn-starch will be found a great improvement. When 
the lower crust is filled, strew the corn-starch evenly over 
it, wet the edge of the lower crust with a, very little water, 
and when the top crust is put on, pinch the edges to- 
gether. 

All dried fruits for pies should be soaked in cold water 
a night before using them. 

Paste should be baked as soon as made. 



Plain Pie Crust — One quart of the finest white flour. 



336 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

sifted; half a pound of batter; half a pound of lard, 
sweet, firm, and of the best quality ; one small teacupful 
of ice-water. 

Sift the flour into a deep wooden bowl, using for the 
purpose a fine hair sieve ; then chop up the lard into the 
flour until it is as fine as dust ; add enough ice-water to 
enable you to work all into a stiff dough, and work with 
a wooden spoon until it is necessary for you to use your 
hands ; then flour them, and knead the paste into a round 
ball with as few strokes as possible ; lay this ball on the 
floured moulding-board, and roll it out into a thin sheet ; 
always roll one way — from you — and with a light, steady 
stroke ; when thin enough, stick little bits of butter, with 
a knife, evenly and closely all over the sheet ; roll up the 
paste then into a compact roll, flatten with your rolling- 
pin, and roll out again as thin as before ; repeat this, bast- 
ing with butter, and flouring lightly each time until the 
butter is used up and the paste smooth and even ; then 
roll up and lay in a very cold place for fifteen minutes ; 
in hot weather it m^y safely be left on the ice for an hour ; 
then roll out several times, and cut into the shape you re- 
quire ; lay the paste on buttered pie-plates, fit it neatly, 
cut off the edges, put in the fruit, put on the paste lid, 
and press down the edges firmly to prevent the escape of 
the juice; or put a paste lattice- work over the fruit; put 
all the scraps of paste together, and roll out into anoth- 
er sheet. Bake pastry in a moderate oven to a light 
brown. 

,Leaf Paste {CuUi/niire Bourgeoise). — One quart of the 
finest white flour passed through a hair sieve ; a pinch of 
salt ; yolks of two eggs ; a piece of fresh butter the size of 
a chestnut ; a glass of cold water. 

Put the sifted flour on your moulding-board, make a 
hole in the middle of the heap, and pour in the yolks, 
well beaten, a pinch of salt, a small piece of butter, and 
enough water to enable you to work the whole together ; 



PASTKY. 337 

do this quickly, handling it as little as possible ; form it 
into a ball, cover it with a clean cloth, and leave it for 
twenty minutes; then dust the moulding-board with flour, 
and roll out the paste ; it should be longer than it is wide ; 
then drain, and roll out into one sheet (between two 
floured linen cloths) eighteen and a half ounces of the 
finest fresh butter ; place this on one half of the sheet of 
paste, and fold the paste over it, so as to sandwich the 
butter ; the paste and the butter should be of precisely 
the same consistency, so that they may be handled, rolled, 
and moulded smoothly ; roll the paste and butter very 
carefully, smoothly, and thinly ; then fold again in three, 
then roll up into a roll, and roll out again into a thin sheet ; 
repeat this — at intervals of a quarter of an hour — six times 
in summer and seven in winter, dusting both moulding- 
board and paste lightly each time with sifted flour; it will 
then be ready, and at the expiration of five minutes may 
be baked ; the oven should be ready beforehand, as this 
leaf paste is easily spoiled by waiting. This is really the 
nicest paste for pies and tarts. 

Oalette ItaLienne, — ^Make as above, roll out "oery thin, 
cut into rounds with a tumbler, prick all over with a fork,

time ; then skim, and when almost cold beat up the butter 
a little with the whipped egg ; when these are thoroughly 
mixed, work tlie flour, roll out twice, dusting lightly each 
time with flour before you fold it, then let it stand five

PUDDINGS. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Puddings arc of two kinds — boiled and baked. Boiled 
puddings should be put into strong bags of coarse linen^ 
well floured inside. These bags should be neatly and 
firmly sewed, and carefully washed (by themselves) every 
time they are used. They should always be kept apart 
from all other household linen, and tightly closed in a tin 
box lest they should contract some odor. 



Amber Pudding, — Mix well together the yolks of three 
or four eggs, a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, a little 
grated nutmeg, and the finely grated rind of one small 
orange. The eggs should, of course, be well beaten, whites 
and yolks separately ; melt a quarter of a pound of but- 
ter, and mix thoroughly with the eggs, etc. ; have ready 
a deep pie-dish lined with puff paste, pour in the mixture, 
and bake half an hour. It is best cold. 

Yeiivs Pudding, — Take a quart mould, butter it well, 
and ornament it with candied ginger ; make a rich cus- 
tard with the yolks of twelve and the whites of six eggs, 
a pint of cream, and loaf sugar to taste ; then dissolve one 
ounce of gelatine in sufficient milk to fill up the mould ; 
when cold add a glassful of rum or sherry ; flavor with 
bitter almond ; when well mixed pour into the mould, 
and set it on the ice to set. The longer it is on the ice 
the better.

ounces of lump sugar, a gill of water, and half an ounce 
of the iinest butter into a small porcelain saucepan, and 
set it over a gentle fire ; stir it with a wooden spoon until 
it is a bright brown, then add half a pint of water, boil, 
skim, and, when cold, bottle and cork it close.

Put the butter and sugar together into a frjing-pan over 
a clear fire ; stir it constantly ; when it froths and the sugar 
dissolves, hold it higher ; when it becomes a deep brown, 
pour in by degrees the other ingredients in the above 
order; boil all slowly for ten minutes, skim, strain, and, 
tvhen cold, bottle. 

On the Use cf Wine in Sauces. — ^It may be laid down 
as an invariable rule that, in making wine sauces, it is safe 
to use at first only half the quantity of wine indicated in 
the receipt, adding the remainder just in time to boil up 
once. In this way the flavor of the sauce is better pre- 
served.

in a saucepan in which you have ah*eady beaten up four 
or five yolks of eggs, with a little butter, and a pinch of 
grated nutmeg ; put it on the fire for a moment, stirring 
it all the time, that the eggs may be well cooked and the 
sauce well mixed. This is a good sauce for vegetables, or 
fish.

percorns, and, lastly, four to five ounces of raw ham, 
chopped fine ; let it come to a boil, then draw to the back 
of the stove, and simmer twenty minutes, stirring often ; 
then strain carefully. 

Bread Sauce, No. 1. — Slice some white bread very thin, 
and remove the crust; boil it in milk with a small onion, 
and some whole white pepper ; take out the onion, rub the 
sauce through a coarse sieve, warm it up again, and stir 



390 THE UKRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

in a small piece of fresh batter before serving. A little 
cream is an improvement, and this, too, shonld be stirred 
in before serving. 

Bread Sauce^ No. 2. — KoU some stale bread cmmhs 
very fine, brown them thoroughly, and put aside; put 
eqnal quantities of milk and cream in a casserole, together 
with a small onion and some peppercorns ; when the onion 
is boiled, take it ont, strain the sance through a sieve, and 
replace it on the fire with a piece of fresh butter ; add 
now, a little at a time, the brown bread crumbs, stirring 
all the time, and, when all are put in, heat the sauce for a 
moment, put into a hot sauceboat, and serve. It is very 
good. 

Beurre de Montpellier. — Blanch in boiling water a large 
handful of sweet herbs, such as chives, chervil, tarragon,

gether with four anchovies, boned and skinned, the yolks 
of eight hard-boiled eggs, two or three cucumbers, a soup- 
gon of garlic, capers, a little salt, pepper, and grated nut- 
meg, and enough fine, fresh butter to work all into a 
smooth, hard paste ; add also some lemon juice and a little 
olive-oil ; color pale olive green with essence of spinach, 
and put in a cool place. Use to garnish cold dishes. 

Beurre cP tJcrevisses {Crabs or Shrimps), — Wash and 
cook the fish with salt and water ; pound the shells (which 
should be bright pink or red in color) and the fiesh to- 
gether in a mortar ; when you have reduced them to a 
smooth paste, mix them with an equal quantity of the 
finest fresh butter ; work smooth in the mortar, then put 
on the fire with a little water, and boil for half an hour ; 
put some clear cold water in the bottom of a jar or pan, 
spread over a coarse muslin, and pour on the butter ; it 
will filter through the muslin, and must be pressed through 
jf necessary; it will float on the water below, from which 



SAUCES FOB MEAT AND FISH. 391 

you must skim it, working it again into shape, and using 
it for flavoring sauces, etc. 

Bewrre dHAil^ or Oarlic Butter. — Pound two large

little, an equal quantity of the finest sifted flour, stirring 
steadily until the sance is smooth as cream ; then add 
two glasses of the water in which the salmon was boiled ; 
this water must be strained, and cool before using it; 
allow the sauce just to come to a boil; then take the 
saucepan from the fire, and add the yolks of two eggs, 
and four and a half ounces of melted butter, never ceas- 
ing to stir it for an instant ; finish with the juice of a 
lemon, and a pinch of roasted powdered parsley. 

Butter Browned. — Put a lump of butter in a frying- 
pan, and toss and stir it over a clear fire until it browns ; 
then dredge with browned flour, and stir into a thick bat- 
ter until it begins to boil. 

Maitre d?H6tel Sauce. — One teacupful of melted but- 
ter, prepared as for Dutch sauce ; one teaspoonful of 
minced parsley ; juice of one lemon ; cayenne and salt to 
taste.

of sifted flour; one and a half ounces of butter; one tea- 
cupful of water or milk ; salt to taste. 

Put the flour and salt in a bowl, and add the milk, a

Dutch Sauce, — ^Put one and a half tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar in a saucepan, and reduce it on the fire to one 
third ; add two ounces of butter, and the yolk of one egg; 
place the saucepan on a slow fire, stir the contents con- 
tinually with a silver or wooden spoon, and as fast as the 



SAUCES FOR MEAT AND FISH. 393 

butter melts add more, until half a pound is used; if the 
sauce becomes too thick at any time during the process, 
add a tablespoonf nl of cold water, and continue stirring ; 
then put in pepper and salt to taste, and take great care 
not to let the sauce boil ; when it is made, and that is 
when the butter is all consumed, and the sauce is of the 
proper thickness, put the saucepan containing it into an- 
other filled with warm {not boiling) water until the time 
of serving. 

Cold Sauce for Fish, — Blanch and pound parsley, cher- 
vil, tarragon, pimpernel, and chives ; when reduced to a

sistency, put it into a small eartlienware casserole, and 

17^ 



894 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

stir constantly until it begins to disintegrate ; then take 
it quickly from the fire, and beat it smooth, adding a few 
drops of cold water; then return to the fire and heat, 
stirring steadily ; do not allow it to boil ; at the last mo- 
ment, after you have taken it from the fire, add a tea- 
spoonful of mustard moistened with vinegar, and a pinch 
of roasted powdered parsley. 

Sauce Poivrade. — Chop fine a large onion and four 
shallots ; put them into a saucepan with some lean, raw 
ham, a little butter, a clove of garlic, a handful of chopped 
mushrooms, some sprigs of parsley, laurel, and thyme, 
three or four peppercorns, and some spices; cook all to- 
gether for eight minutes ; then add a glassful of good 
vinegar; cook again until the vinegar is reduced to one 
half ; add two glassf nls of Sauce JSspagnole ; let all come 
to a boil ; then place the saucepan where its contents can 
only simmer ; a quarter of an hour afterwards skim it; add 
cayenne pepper to taste, and serve. 

Sauce Ravigote, — Put into a saucepan two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of chopped shallots, and six tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar ; cook until the liquid is reduced to one half ; then 
add six tablespoonfuls of white sauce, rather thick ; let 
all boil for a few seconds ; then withdraw the saucepan 
from the fire, and mix with the sauce, drop by drop, the 
quarter of a tumblerful of oil of Lucca, stirring steadily 
one way ; when smooth add a teaspoonf ul of made mus- 
tard, and a pinch each of tarragon and pimpernel chopped 
fine.

capers; four anchovies boned and pounded to a pulp ; bind 



SAUCES FOR MEAT AND FISH. 395 

with a little melted batter, pass through a sieve, and mix 
with the sance at the last moment. 

Sauce HoUandaise, — Use for this saace only the fresh- 
est butter and eggs ; put one and a half tablespoonf uls of 
vinegar into a saucepan, with a pinch of salt, and a still 
smaller pinch of white pepper ; reduce this on the fire to 
one third ; withdraw the sauce from the fire ; add two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, and the yolks of two eggs, 
from which you have carefully removed every particle of 
white; replace the saucepan on a slow fire, and stir with 
a wooden spoon, until the eggs thicken, then remove from 
the fire, add two ounces of butter, stir till it dissolves ; 
then replace on the fire for one minute, and add two 
ounces of butter ; stir until it dissolves, then remove from 
the fire, and stir in two more ounces of butter ; proceed 
in this order, stirring steadily, until you have used up all 
the butter; when you add butter for the third time put 
in also a tablespoonf ul of cold water ; the quantity of but- 
ter used should be half a pound ; stir smoothly and un- 
ceasingly ; should the sauce be too thick, add another ta- 
blespoonful of cold water. Under no circumstances be 
induced to thicken this sauce with flour. The principle 
of HoUandaiae sauce is to be composed solely of eggs and 
butter. " To my mind SaiLce UoUandaise is the king of 
sauces" (Gouff^. 

Houx (Gouff^). — BcnuB is made with flour and butter ; it 
should be cooked on a very slow fire until it becomes pale 
brown in color. 

Put the saucepan containing the roux on the fire, moisten 
with a little water, stir continually with a wooden spoon, 
and cook over a quick fire until it begins to boil ; then set 
it back on the stove, simmer for an hour, strain, and put 
into an earthen jar. 

Green MayonnaiM. — Make a mayonnaUe as usual, but 



396 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

work into it gradually a tablespoonful of powdered herbs, 
as for Saiuic Bavigote and a few drops of essence of spin- 
ach.

pint of cream, a little stock, salt, and grated nutmeg; let 
it come to a boil, and it is ready. 

Parsley-andrLemon Sauce. — Wash a handful of pars- 
ley, and mince it finely with the pulp and grated rind of 
a lemon ; melt a pat of butter in a saucepan, mix with 
it a tablespoonful of flour, add the parsley and lemon, 
enough stock to make a sauce, a little pounded mace, and 
a few capers ; stir over the fire, and when partly cooked 
withdraw from the fire a moment, and add the yolks of 
two eggs beaten up; heat to a boil, salt, dish, and serve. 

Shrimp Sa/uce. — Take half a pint of boiled shrimps, pick 
out the meat from the tails, pound the rest in a mortar with 
the juice of half a lemon and a piece of butter, and pass 
it tlirough a sieve ; make a pint of melted butter, put 
the meat from the tails into it, add a dust of cayenne, and 
when the sauce boils stir into it the shrimp butter which 
has come through the sieve, with a tablespoonful of cream. 
Crab and lobster sauce can be made in the same way. 

Sardine Sauce. — Skin, bone, and tail twelve sardines, 
and pull them into very small pieces ; chop up with them 
a shallot, a small quantity of parsley, and the grated rind 
of half a large lemon ; melt in a saucepan a pat of butter; 
mix with it a small tablespoonful of browned flour; when 
it has taken color add the mince with enough stock to 
make good sauce ; let it boil, add salt to taste, and a soupgon 
of grated nutmeg, and serve. 



SAUCES FOR MEAT AND FISH. 397 

Tartare Sauce. — Put the yolks of fonr eggs into a plate, 
then salt and mnstard to taste, and a tiny pinch of white 
sngar ; work in, drop by drop, the oil, which should be of 
the finest qnality; or use thick, fresh cream instead of 
oil ; then work in the tarragon vinegar, add white pepper, 
a sawpcon of cayenne, a bntton onion minced and mashed 
fine, and a little pickled cacamber cut fine; rub the dish 
in which it is served with garlic. 

Italian Sauce, — ^Mince a couple of shallots finely, and 
fry them in a little salad oil to a pale straw color ; add two 
or three mushrooms and a little parsley, both finely minced; 
moisten with enough stock and white wine, in equal parts, 
to make the sauce ; put in, tied up together, some sweet 
herbs and a bay leaf, add pepper and salt to taste, and let 
the sauce boil for half an hour ; remove the herbs and bay 
leaf, melt a large piece of butter in a saucepan, add a lit- 
tle flour to it, stir well, and then add the sauce. 

White Lemon Sauce for Boiled Fowls. — ^Pnt the peel of 
a fresh lemon into one pint of rich, sweet cream, together 
with a sprig of lemon thyme and ten white peppercorns ; 
simmer gently until the cream tastes of the lemon ; then 
strain, and thicken it with a quarter of a pound of butter 
and one tablespoonf ul of sifted flour ; allow it to boil up 
once, and pour the juice of one lemon into it, stirring it 
well ; salt to taste. 

Sauce for Hot or Cold Roast Beef — Grate some horse- 
radish very fine, and add a little made mustard, as much 
powdered white sugar, and four large tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, also a pinch of salt.

898 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

three ounces of grated horseradish ; three blades of mace ; 
two teaspoonf uls of made mastard ; two teaspoonf uls of 
sifted sugar. 

Put all the ingredients into a porcelain-lined saucepan, 
stir steadily, and simmer gently till all rawness of taste 
disappears ; then withdraw from the fire, allow it to cool, 
and put into small, wide-necked bottles ; cork tightly. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice some ripe, tart ap- 
ples ; stew in water enough to cover them until they break 
to pieces ; add brown sugar to taste, and a pinch of nut- 
meg ; beat to a smooth pulp, and stir in a good lump of 
butter. 

Grariberry Sauce. — Wash and pick a quart of ripe cran- 
berries, and put into a saucepan with a teacupf ul of water ; 
stew slowly, stirring often, until they are as thick as mar- 
malade ; they require at least an hour and a half to cook ; 
when you take them from thef/re^ sweeten abundantly with 
white sugar ; then pulp through a coarse mosquito-net into 
a mould wet with cold water. 

Peach Sauce (Old Marie's). — Soak a quart of dried 
peaches in water four houre ; wash them carefully, chang- 
ing the water two or three times ; drain and put into a 
stewpan with just water enough to cover them ; stew till 
they break to pieces, putting in, also, a little dried orange 
peel for flavoring ; rub to a soft pulp, sweeten to taste 
with white sugar, and just before taking from the fire 
stir in a tablespoonf ul of corn-starch moistened with cold

CUSTARDS, CREAMS, JELLIES, 
AND BLANC-MANGES. 

RULES FOB MAKING CUSTARD. 

1. Always boil custard by bain-marie — that is, by put- 
ting the vessel containing the custard inside of another 
partly filled with hot water, taking care that tlie water in 
the outer vessel is not deep enough to float the custard-ket- 
tle, or to boil over into it. 

2. Do not let the milk quite boil before adding the 
yolks; take the scalding milk from the fire and beat it 
gradually into the yolks, then i*eturn to the fire and boil 
gently until it thickens, stirring constantly. Allow ten or 
fifteen minutes for thickening a quart. 

3. Allow five eggs to a quart of milk, and a table- 
spoonful of sugar to each egg. For a very plain cus- 
tard allow four tablespoonfuls of sugar to the quart, and 
an egg for each cupful of milk. Custards, creams, and 
trifles that are to be frozen should have one third more 
sugar. " Floating Island " is made like plain custard, reserv- 
ing, however, all the whites for the meringvs. Proceed 
according to the foregoing receipt, taking care that the 
meringice is whipped up with colored fruit jelly. 



Plain Custa/rd. — One quart of milk; the yolks and 
whites of five eggs ; six tablespoonfuls of sugar ; flavoring 
to taste. 

Heat the milk almost to boiling, beat the yolks light, 
and stir in the sugar ; add the scalding milk to the eggs, 
in the manner directed above, stir in next the five whites 



400 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

whipped very stiff, return to the fire, and stir until thick, 
but be careful not to let it break ; flavor, stir, and pour 
into cups. If you wish to make tliis more effective, you 
may whip the whites of two- eggs to a meringicej with a 
heaping tablespoonful of powdered sugar, and drop a lit- 
tle of this on the top of each cup. 

Pistachio Custard,— Make a custard as usual, and add 
one tenth of a pound of pistachio nuts, which should be 
prepared as follows: Scald them in boiling water, and 
then peel them and pound them to a smooth paste in a 
mortar. This paste should be added to the custard be- 
fore it is put on the fire, and just before taking it from 
the fire add enough essence of spinach to give it a fine 
green color. 

German Custard, — Make a custard as usual, adding half 
an ounce of sweet almonds, blanched, roasted, and pound- 
ed to a paste, and half an ounce of pinenuts or peanuts, 
blanched, roasted, and pounded ; also a small quantity of 
candied citron cut into the thinnest possible slips; cook 
the custard as usual, and set it on the ice for some hours 
before using. 

Polish Custard, — Take six Naples biscuits, or small 
sponge cakes; dry them in the oven, then crumble them 
fine, and roll with the rolling-pin until they are reduced 
to a powdei* ; moisten them with half a glassful of fresh 
cream, then add the yolks of eight eggs well beaten, and 
sweeten to taste with powdered sugar, sifted, and lastly 
four glassfuls of f re^h cream, and a few drops of essence 
of bitter almond. 

Cook di hain-marie^ stirring continually with a wooden 
or silver spoon until the cream thickens, but do not let it 
boil ; when of the proper consistency remove the casserole 
from the fire, pour the cream into a dish, and set it aside 
to cool ; when quite»cold, sift some fine sugar on the top 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS, JELLIES, AND BLANC-MANGES. 401 

of the custard, taking care to do so very evenly, so that 
the custard is, as it were, iced ; then burn this sugar by 
passing a red-hot iron spatula very lightly over it, without 
touching the custard ; if properly done, the sugar forms a 
brown, glazed crust on top of the custard. The effect is 
admirable. 

Lemon Creanis. — Pare four lemons very thinly, and 
throw into twelve tablespoonf uls of water ; squeeze juice 
over eight ounces of finely powdered sugar ; well beat the 
yolks of ten eggs, add peel, water, and juice gradually, and 
strain through muslin into a stewpan. 

Stir it one way over a gentle fire until it becomes pret- 
ty thick, but do not let it boil. Serve cold in custard 
cups. • 

Nesselrode Cream d la Husse, — One pint of syrup of 
loaf sugar, flavored with vanilla ; fifty fine large chest- 
nuts, boiled, peeled, pounded, and pressed through a sieve ; 
one quart of fresh cream ; the yolks of twelve eggs well 
beaten. 

Moisten the strained chestnuts with the syrup, adding 
little by little the cream and the beaten yolks; when all 
these ingredients are smoothly mixed together, cook d 
hain-mai^ie^ stirring continually until the cream begins to 
thicken ; add then a piece of candied citron, sliced fine, 
one tenth of a pound of Sultana raisins, seeded and dredged, 
and a glassful of Maraschino ; add also, and lastly, a quart 
of whipped cream,-and the yolks of three eggs well beaten ; 
stir continually until the cream is as- smooth as velvet, and 
very thick ; then pour into a dish, and set on the ice for 
some hours before serving. 

Strawberry Cream, — Press through a sieve five ounces 
of ripe strawberries; put the pulp in a casserole with five 
ounces of sifted sugar, one -quarter ounce of powdered 
gum arabic, and a pint of good, fresh cream. 



402 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Mix all the ingredients smoothly together, then pnt the 
casserole on the fire, stirring continually with a wooden 
spoon until cooked. This cream may be allowed to boil, 
and is, indeed, better if allowed to boil for five minutes. 
Eat ice-cold. 

Peach Cream — is made in exactly the same way, omit- 
ting the gum arabic, and using enough cream to prevent 
the mixture from being too thick. 

Whipped Cream with Chesim^uU, — Choose large, fine 
chestnuts, boil until tender, then drain, peel (removing 
outer and inner skin), and press through a colander; ar- 
range the light, feathery mass thus obtained in a pile 
in the centre of a round dish, and pour round it some 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored with bitter al- 
monds. 

Caramel Cream. — Make a custard as usual, using burned 
sugar instead of white sugar; sweeten to taste. 

It is impossible to measure the sugar otherwise, as 
burned sugar has less sweetening power than ordinary 
sugar. The custard so made should be of a delicate brown 
color. It is delicious. 

Solid Snow or Rahm Sultz. — Bring to the boiling-point 
one quart of fresh, rich cream or milk ; pour this quickly 
over two spoonfuls of corn-flour, blended with some cold 
cream ; sweeten to taste, and allow it to boil gently, stirring 
for two or three minutes; add quickly the whites of six 
eggs, beaten to a stiff froth; do not allow it to boil up 
more than once after adding the egg; flavor with lemon, 
vanilla, bitter almond, ratifia, or grated lemon peel ; lay 
the snow thus formed quickly in rocky heaps on sil- 
ver or glass dishes, or in shapes. Iced, it will turn out

PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 

RULES FOR PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 

Use none but porcelain-lined preserving-kettles. 

Select, fine, fresh f rnit ; pick it over carefully, and be 
sure that it is quite dry. 

Use the best loaf sugar. 

Put up the preserves in rather small jars, of glass or 
stone china; cover with brandied tissue paper pressed 
closely to the preserve ; then put on a cover of thick paper. 

Keep all preserves in a cool, dry, dark closet; watch 
them carefully for several weeks after making them, and 
if they show signs of fermentation boil them over, add- 
ing more sugar. 

Fill all preserve and jelly jars to the very top. 

If jellies are not very firm, after six or eight hours' 
standing, set the jars in the sun with bits of glass to cover 
them. This may be done day after day until the jelly is 
properly firm. 

If absolutely obliged to use a bell-metal kettle for pre- 
serving, scour it with sand just before using it; then set 
it over the fire with a cupful of vinegar and a handful of 
salt in it ; let this come to a boil, and scour the whole of 
the inside of the kettle with it ; then rinse out the kettle, 
wipe carefully, and put in the preserves ; the instant they 
are cooked, remove them from the kettle, and wash it 
clean, even though you intend to return the syrup to it in 
five minutes. 

Apricot Olacees. — Prepare exactly like peach glacees 
(page 427). They are very good. 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 415 

Apricot Paste {O'uisinihre jParisienne). — Peel and stone 
the apricots, and cook in a little water until they are quite 
tender and transparent; then mash and pass through a 
hair sieve, dr^rin dry, weigh, and pound them in a mortar 
with an equal weight of powdered sugar; spread the paste 
upon flat dishes to dry; after several days cut it into 
rounds, powder with sugar, dry again, and preserve in 
boxes. 

Apricot Marmalade, — Take firm, ripe apricots, stone 
and cut out the bad parts of the skin, cut in two, and put 
into a preserving-kettle in alternate layers of fruit and 
loaf sugar, allowing half a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit ; cook slowly three quarters of an hour, and a little 
before removing the kettle from the fire add one half of 
the kernels, blanched ; stir well, pack in pots, and when 
cold close and tie up as usual. 

Apricot Cheese — Is made precisely as you make " Quince 
Cheese " (page 420). 

Apple Ovnger, — Take two pounds of pippins or other 
hard apples ; pare, core, and cut them into eight pieces, 
dropping them into cold water as they are cut; make 
a syrup of three pounds of white sugar, a little water, 
and four ounces of ginger (or some piece ginger) ; stew 
the apples slowly until transparent, put them into a jar, 
and strain the juice over them. 

Apple Jelly. — Pare, core, and quarter the apples, and 
put them, together with the skins and cores, in a jar in a 
slow oven ; when quite soft, strain through a coarse mus 
lin bag, pressing hard to extract all the flavor; then add 
some lemon juice and set on the tire again, allowing to 
every pint of liquor a pound of loaf sugar, prepared as in 
the receipt for " Fruit Jellies " (page 433) ; let the jelly come 
to a boil ; then take the kettle from the fire, roll the glass- 



416 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

es in hot water, and fill with the scalding liquid ; cover 
with brandied tissue paper, and put in a cool place. 

Preserved Chestnuts, — ^Parboil fifty fine, large chestnuts 
until you can prick them easily with a fork ; then take 
them from the fire, peel and cleanse them thoroughly, and 
throw them into ice-cold water in which you have previ- 
ously squeezed the juice of one large lemon ; after they 
have remained in the water long enough to become slight- 
ly hardened, throw them into a syrup made of sugar, add- 
ing, at the same time, the juice of another lemon, and two 
or three teaspoonf uls of orange-flower syrup ; let all cook 
together slowly until the mixture has acquired a certain 
stiffness, when it may be removed from the fire and put 
into jars. 

Preserved Cherries, — Stone the cherries, preservfng ev- 
ery drop of jnice; weigh the fruit, allowing pound for 
pound of sugar ; put a layer of fruit for one of sugar 
until all is used up ; pour over the juice, and boil gently 
until the syrup begins to thicken. The short-stem red 
cherries are best for this preserve. Sweet cherries will 
not do. 

Preserved Strawberries. — ^Pound for pound ; put them 
into a preserving kettle, over a slow fire, until the sugar 
melts ; boil fast twenty -five minutes ; take out the fruit 
in perforated skimmers, and fill small jars three quarters 
full ; boil and skim the syrup five minutes longer, fill up 
the jars, and seal while hot ; keep in a cool, dry place. 

Preserved Pears, — Pare, leaving the stems on, and pre- 
serve as you preserve peaches (receipt No. 1, page 426). 

Preserved Crab Apples. — Choose for preserving the 
red Siberian crab ; pick over carefully, selecting the per- 
fect ones, leaving the stems, and put into a preserve ket- 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 417 

tie with enough warm water to cover them ; heat this to 
boiling slowly, and simmer until the skins break ; drain, 
and skim them, then extract the cores through the blos- 
som ends ; weigh them, allow a pound and a quarter of 
sugar and a teacupf ul of water to every pound of fruit ; 
boil the water and sugar together until the scum ceases to 
rise ; put in the fruit, cover the kettle, and simmer until 
the apples are a clear red and tender; take out with a 
skimmer, spread upon dishes to cool, add to the syrup the 
juice of one lemon to three pounds of fruit, and boil un- 
til clear and rich ; fill your jars three quarters full of the 
apples, pour the syrup in, and when cold tic up. 

Preserved Ginger. — Pare the roots of green ginger, and 
lay in cold water fifteen minutes ; boil in three waters, 
changing the hot for cold every time until very tender ; 
drain, and lay in ice-water. Allow for the syrup a pound 
and a quarter of loaf sugar to every pound of ginger, and 
a cupful of water for each pound of sugar ; boil and skim 
until the scum ceases to rise ; when the syrup is cold^ wipe 
the ginger dry, and drop it in ; let it stand twenty-four 
hours; drain off, and reheat the syrup; this time put the 
ginger in when it is blood-warm ; do not look at it again 
for two days ; then reboil the syrup, and pour over the 
ginger scalding hot ; in a week drain off once more, boil, 
and add again, while hot, to the ginger; cover closely. 
It will be fit for use in a fortnight. 

PreBerved Figs d la Louisiana, — The weight of ripe 
figs in sugar ; the peel of one lemon and juice of two ; a 
little ginger. 

Cover the figs with cold water for twelve hours ; then 
simmer, in water enough to cover them, until tender, and 
spread out upon a sieve to cool and harden ; make a syrup 
of the sugar and a cupful of cold water to every pound ; 
boil until free frorfi scum, put in the figs, and simmer ten 
minutes ; take them out, and spread upon dishes in the

pressing it hard; turn into moulds wet with cold water, 
and set in a cold place. 

Bibbon Blanc-mange. — Make according to the foregoing 
receipt, and, after straining, divide into five portions, col- 
oring one gre^n with essence of spinach, one pink with 
cochineal, one yellow with yolk of egg, and one brown 



CUSTARDS, CREAMS, JELLIES, AND BLANC-MANGES. 409 

with chocolate; leave the fifth uncolored; when quite 
cold pour into a mould the pink first, then the green, then 
the white, then the yellow, and lastly the chocolate ; set in 
a cold place. 

Farina EUmomange, — One quart 'of rich milk; three 
eggs, well beaten, whites and yolks separately; four table- 
spoonfuls of farina wet with cold water; one cupful of 
sugar; fiavoring to taste; one saltspoonful of salt. 

Heat the milk to boiling, stir in the farina and salt, and 
boil fifteen minutes before adding the yolks beaten with 
the sugar; boil two minutes longer, stirring steadily; re- 
move from the fire, beat in the whites, then the fiavoring; 
pour into moulds, and set away to cool ; eat with sugar 
and cream ; the eggs and fiavoring may be omitted. 

Corn-starch Blanc-mange — ^Is made as above, but only 
boiled five minutes before adding the yolks. 

Tapioca Blanc-mange. — One pint of rich, fresh milk ; 
three quarters of a cupful of sugar ; half a pound of tapioca 
soaked in cold water four hours ; two teaspoonf uls of bit- 
ter almonds or other fiavoring ; a pinch of salt. 

Heat the milk, and stir in the soaked tapioca ; when it 
has dissolved, add the sugar ; boil slowly fifteen minutes, 
stirring all the time ; take off the fire, and beat well until 
nearly cold ; fiavor and pour into moulds. 

Sago Blano-m/mge. — ^Make as above. 

Arrow-root Blano-mange. — Three cupf uls of new milk ; 
two and a half tablespoonfuls of arrow-root wet with cold 
milk; half a cupful of sugar; fiavoring to taste, and a 
little white wine. 

Mix the arrow-root to a smooth batter, with one cupful 
of the milk ; heat the rest to boiling ; add the arrow-root, 
stirring constantly ; when it begins to thicken put in the

stewing skins, cores, and seeds in a vessel by themselves, 
with barely enough water to cover them ; when these have 
simmered long enough, strain this water through a thick 
cloth ; then put the quinces into a preserving-kettle, pour 
over them the quince water when almost cold, and boil, stir- 
ring the quinces, and mashing them with a wooden spoon 
as they become soft ; to every three pounds of fruit you 
may allow the juice of three oranges ; when all is reduced 
to a smooth paste stir in a scant three quartei*s of a pound 
of sugar to every pound of fruit ; boil ten minutes more, 
stirring constantly ; take oflE, and when cool put into small 
jars ; when cold, cover and seal as usual. 

Quince Cheese—Is quince marmalade boiled down very 
thick, and packed tightly into jars; it will turn out firm 
as cheese. 

Preseroed Apples, — Choose firm, well-flavored pippins, 
and preserve exactly as you do quinces, adding, how- 
ever, the juice of three lemons to every three pounds of 
fruit. 

Preseroed Fox Orapes. — Split each grape, and take out 
the seeds, pour boiling water upon them, add a pinch of 
alum, scatter a few grape leaves among them, and cover 
close; let them stand until they become yellow, then make 
a syrup, allowing one pound of sugar to one pound of 
grapes ; drain the fruit, and put into it the boiling syrup, 
keep the kettle covered while boiling ; put into jars, and, 
when cold, close and tie up as usual. 

Oranges^ Whole^ in Syrwp, — Take six ounces of white 
sugar, one gill of water, the juice of two lemons, and the 
rind of one, and of half an orange, peeled thin. 

Boil until the syrup clarifies, and pour hot over eight 
oranges peeled to the pulp ; a little cochineal makes them 
prettier. 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 421 

Florida Lemon Preserve. — Qrate the lemons to break 
the oil-vessels, soak them for two days in salt and water, 
and after this for one day in fresh water ; drain them well, 
and weigh them, allowing each pound of fruit one pound 
and a quarter of sugar, and one pint of water to every 
pound of sugar. 

Ogeechee Limes. — Boil the limes until soft, and push out 
quickly the head of each while hot ; then make a syrup 
of one pound of sugar to three pints of water, and boil it 
until clear; then throw in the limes, and let them boil un- 
til transparent. 

Green Sweetmeat^ No. 1. — Lay as many mangoes as you 
require in strong salt water for ten days, slit them, take out 
the seeds, throw them into fresh water, and let them remain 
one or two days, then boil them in vinegar for several 
hours, after which soak them for a day or two in fresh 
water, changing the water every day, or until no vinegar 
remains ; make a syrup of ginger tea and loaf sugar, allow- 
ing three pounds of sugar to one of melon; boil for sev- 
eral hours, or until quite clear. 

Green Sweetmeatj No. 2. — Take a thick watermelon 
rind, pare off the outer riud, cut it into any funny shape, 
and throw into a bell-metal skillet with cold water and a 
piece of alum the size of an egg to every three pounds of 
rind ; let it boil until tender, and the rind becomes of a 
pale green color, then pour off the alum, and let it stand 
in cold water twelve hours, or longer if the alum is not 
soaked out ; then weigh the rind, and to every pound of 
rind add a pound and a half of loaf sugar, and throw them 
into fresh ginger tea, a pint to the pound ; let it settle, 
and when clear add mace and lemon peel ; boil it until 
sufficiently done, of which you may judge by observing if 
the sugar has penetrated the rind, taking care always to 
have syrup enough to cover the rind ; let it stand some 
weeks before using it. 



422 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Beaufort Oreen- Orange Preserve. — Green oranges, 
placked from the trees in September or October ; grate 
(with a medium grater) all over lightly but thoroughly ; 
throw each orange, after grating it, into salt and water 
until all are grated, then, with a sharp penknife, cut a hole 
in the stem end of the oran;i;e, and cut out all the pulp in 
the centre which contains the seeds ; then scoop out with 
a small silver spoon as much of the pulp as possible, with- 
out injuring the orange, which must keep its shape in- 
tact. Weigh the oranges, and to every pound allow two 
pounds of the best sugar ; measure a pint of water to a 
pound of sugar ; stir it well, and put it on the fire to boil 
until it forms a thin syrup; put the oranges in the syrup 
carefully, one by one, and let them boil steadily but slowly 
all day ; if they boil rapidly they break ; to ascertain if they 
are done, take up one in a ladle and look at it in a strong 
light; if there are no opaque spots in it, it is done; then 
pierce with a straw ; if the straw passes through them 
easily there is no doubt. Shaddocks are preserved in the 
same manner. 

Florida-Orange Ma/rmalade. — The large, thick-skinned, 
sour orange is the best for this marmalade. Grate the 
oranges slightly to break the oil- vessels; then peel, cutting 
the peel into long, very thin strips ; then put the peel on 
to boil, changing the water four times; meanwhile pre- 
pare the pulp ; this is done by slitting down each fig or 
compartment of the orange with a sharp knife, and scrap- 
ing out the pulp free from skin or seeds ; after the peel 
has boiled sufficiently, strain oflE the water, and pound 
one half of it in a mortar ; cut the other half into fine 
shreds ; mix these with the pulp, and measure it ; allow 
one pound of loaf sugar to every pint of pulp and peel 
mixed; put it over a slow fire, stirring it constantly until 
done. 

Orange Marmalade^ Dwndee, — To every pound of 



FRESEBVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 423 

grated orange peel add one and a quarter pounds of sugar ; 
cut and squeeze the oranges over a strainer, and put the 
seeds into a pitcher, with a pint and a half of water, to 
stand all night ; boil the peel in several waters until 
clear and almost free from bitter taste ; let all stand for 
twenty-four hours, then cut the peel into long, thin strips ; 
add the sugar, with a small tumbler of water, to the jelly 
made by the seeds and juice, and boil for one hour, tak- 
ing oS the scum as fast as it rises. 

Orange Marmalade^ Sorrento, — Weigh the oranges, then 
grate them to break the oil-vessels ; cut tliem lengthwise, 
taking out the seeds and pulp ; put the skins on to boil, 
changing the water once ; when boiled tender, pound two 
thirds in a mortar, and cut the rest into narrow strips; put 
in the same quantity of sugar that the oranges weighed be- 
fore grating; wet the sugar with a little water, and let it 
come to a boil ; then put into it the juice and scraped pulp, 
the pounded skin and the chipped skin, and boil it, stir- 
ring constantly towards the last. 

St, MartirCs Orange Marmalade, — Take sour Sicily 
ornnges, twelve pounds ; twelve pounds of sugar. 

Pare the oranges down like apples, and soak the peel in 
five or six quarts of water, until tender ; throw the water 
away, after skimming it oflE ; cut the peel into small strips ; 
put the sugar in a kettle, and cut the oranges in half, and 
take a small, strong spoon, and take out the juice and 
pulp, and pour it over the sugar, carefully taking out all 
the seeds ; take the white skins and throw over them two 
quarts of warm water ; soak until they are soft, mash it 
through a sieve, and you will have about one and three 
quarter pounds; then take the strained pulp, the peel, the 
sugar, and the juice, and boil all together ; after it com- 
mences to boil hard, it should boil for twenty minutes or 
half an hour, until quite thick ; put into glasses. 



424 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Orange- and' Apple Marmalade, — Two dozen oranges, 
weighed, peeled, freed from seeds and all tlie tough white 
pulp ; boil the peel for half an hour, then take oflE all 
the white inside skin, leaving only the thin yellow rind ; 
cut this into chips the thickness of a straw, and put them 
into cold water to extract the bitterness; change the 
water several times; then add to the oranges one 
pound of grated apples, and the weight of the oranges 
in sugar, with another pound for the apples ; put them 
over a moderate fire in a preserving-kettle, throw in 
the rind chips, and let the whole cook until clear and 
thick. 

Preserved Sour -Orange Peel, — Basp the peel with a 
coarse grater to break the oil- vessels, then cut the orange 
into quarters, taking out all of the inside ; put the peel in 
brine for several days, then extract the salt by soaking 
it in fresh water several days, changing it twice a day ; 
make a thin syrup and boil it down ; put in the peel, 
and boil it until you can pierce it with a straw ; when 
done, put the pieces in glass jars, with plenty of syrup; 
allow one pound and a quarter of loaf sugar to every pound 
of peel. 

Preserved Orange Blossoms, — Clean fresh oi*ange blos- 
soms, and cut them up, mincing them rather finely ; 
sprinkle them well with lemon juice, and cook with 
finely sifted white sugar and a sufficient quantity of 
water, taking care not to throw in the orange blossoms 
until the syrup begins to froth; then let all boil togeth- 
er, beating smartly the while with a wooden spatula, 
and withdraw the casserole from the fire the moment 
the mixture begins to swell into bubbles ; it should then 
be placed in small pretty paper or porcelain boxes, or 
in small tin forms, shaped like tiny oranges, or large 
orange blossoms. From these forms it can be removed 
when cold. 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 425 

Preserved Bases. — Take fresh rose petals, dip them in 
rose water, mash thero, and boil the juice with a snflS- 
cient quantity of crystallized sugar ; color this syrup witli 
cochineal or extract of crimson roses, and just before tak- 
ing it from the fire dip into it, one by one, some large, 
firm, fresh rose petals ; they will candy beautifully ; when 
cold, they should be lightly dusted with finely sifted crys- 
tallized sugar. The conserve may be put into jars with 
brandied paper on the top. 

Preserved Violets. — Take the freshest and most fra- 
grant violets, and pound them in a mortar in order to 
extract the color and savor ; have ready a syrup of fine- 
ly clarified sugar ; add to this when tepid the juiqe of 
the violets, and a few drops of lemon juice, together 
with a very few fresh violets ; put all again on the fire 
and cook for some moments, beating or stirring hard all 
the time with a wooden spatula ; it should be withdrawn 
from the fire the moment the syrup begins to swell into 
bubbles. 

Peaches Preserved Whole. — Fifteen pounds of cling- 
stone peaches, pared, but not cut up or stoned ; seven and 
a half pounds of loaf sugar. 

Dissolve one half of the sugar in as little water as pos- 
sible; set the kettle on the fire, and when it begins to 
simmer throw in a layer of peaches ; let them boil from 
twenty to thirty minutes ; then take them out, free from 
syrup, and lay them on a flat dish to cool ; throw in an- 
other layer, and so on until all are cooked ; after you have 
boiled two or three layers the syrup will have increased ; 
by degrees add the rest of the sugar, and, when all are 
done, boil up the syrup until a little thick ; then, as 
you take the kettle from the fire, stir in carefully and 
thoroughly half a pint of alcohol ; put the peaches into 
jars ; pour on the boiling syrup, and when cold cover and 
seal as usual. 



426 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK 

Preserved Pea^heSy No. 1. — Fine yellow peaches, pared 
and stoned; equal weight of loaf sugar with the pared 
and stoned peaches. 

Put a layer of loaf sugar at the bottom of a preserving- 
kettle, then a layer of fruit, and so on until the kettle is 
full ; put the kettle in a cool corner of the range until the 
sugar is dissolved ; then boil the fruit until it is clear and 
thoroughly cooked ; then take out the pieces with a per- 
forated skimmer, and lay on dry dishes; boil the syrup in 
the kettle until quite thick; fill the jars half full with 
fruit, pour over the syrup, adding one quarter of the ker- 
nels which have been blanched and boiled until soft in 
enough water to barely cover them ; when cold, cover and 
close as usual. 

Preserved Peaches^ No. 2. — Proceed precisely as above, 
only adding the water in which the kernels have been 
boiled to the fruit and sugar as soon as the sugar is 
melted. 

Peach Marmalade, — Pare, stone, and weigh the fruit; 
heat slowly to draw out the juice, stirring up often from 
the bottom with a wooden spoon ; after it is hot, boil up 
quickly, still stirring, for three quarters of an hour ; add 
then the sugar, allowing three quarters of a pound to each 
pound of fruit ; boil up well for five minutes, taking off 
every particle of scum ; add the juice of a lemon for every 
three pounds of frait, and the water in which one fourth 
of the kernels have been boiled and steeped; stew all 
together ten minutes, stirring to a smooth paste, and take 
from the fire ; put up in small jars, and, when cold, cover 
and close as usual. 

Peach Figs, — Pare the peaches, and cut them in half ; 
weigh them, and allow half a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit ; put the fruit and sugar alternately into 
the kettle, and heat all gradually until the sugar is dis- 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 427 

solved ; then boil until clear ; take the peaches out with 
a perforated skimmer, lay them on dishes, without any of 
the syrup, in the sun, and turn them frequently until dry, 
putting them on dry dishes as the syrup drains away from 
them ; when dry enough to handle, pack them in drums 
or boxes, with layers of sifted sugar, beginning and ending 
with sugar ; if you have any syrup left you may boil more 
peaches in it. 

Camdied Peaches. — Four pounds of peaches, peeled 
and cut in quai*ters; one pound of loaf sugar. 

Simmer sugar and peaches in a very little water, until 
a straw can pierce them ; take them from the kettle with 
a perforated skimmer, roll each piece in sifted sugar, place 
them on dishes, the pieces to lie a little apart to dry y put 
the dishes in a sunny room — not in the sun, but where the 
air can blow over them ; turn the pieces from time to time, 
and sift a little more sugar over them; they will take 
some days to dry and crystallize ; use mosquito netting to 
keep off the flies. 

Peach Jam, — For every pound of peaches allow three 
quarters of a pound of sugar ; pare the peaches and slice 
line ; put them on the fire in a preserving-kettle with a 
little water, about a pint to a peck of fruit ; boil quickly, 
stirring constantly to prevent burning ; when it is easily 
mashed, add the sugar ; as soon as it begins to boil again 
stir incessantly, and do not let the fire be too strong, or it 
will scorch ; stir it until it is a smooth pulp, and put it in 
wide-mouthed jars ; when cold, paste the jars up tight. 

Pea^h Olac^ea {Cuiamihre Parisienne). — Take fine 
peaches, not quite ripe, peel, and put into an earthen pot ; 
pour on enough boiling water to cover them ; cover the 
pot closely, and set away for four hours ; clarify some loaf 
sugar, allowing a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit ; 
put your peaches into the syrup and let them cook until 



428 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

they are tender, but not until they break ; take them out; 
put them carefully one by one into a jar ; boil down the 
syrlip until thick and clear, stir into^it a wineglassful of 
brandy, pour boiling hot over the peaches; cork, cover, 
and set away. 

Baisine de JRaisins {Cuisinihre Pariaienne). — String 
the grapes, which should be sweet and ripe, press out the 
juice, put on the fire, and boil down to a fourth of the 
quantity, stirring constantly ; when reduced so far, strain, 
replace on the fire, boil to a thick syrup, pour boiling 
hot into jars, cover with brandied paper, again with thick 
paper, and set away in a cool, dark place. 

Pineapple Marmalade, — Pare, slice, core, and weigh 
the pineapple, then cut into small bits ; make a syrup of 
a teacupf ul of water to two pounds of sugar ; melt, and 
heat to a boil ; helit the chopped pineapple in another ves- 
sel, set that in a vessel of boiling water, covering closely, to 
keep in the flavor; when it is smoking hot all through, and 
begins to look clear, add to the syrup ; boil together half an 
hour, stirring all the while until it is a clear, bright paste. 

Preserved Pineapple. — Pare, cut into slices, core, and 
weigh, allowing a pound of loaf sugar to each pound of 
fruit ; put into alternate layers in the kettle, and pour in 
water, allowing a teacnpf ul to each pound of sugar ; heat 
to a boil, take out the pineapple, and spread upon dishes 
in the sun ; boil and skim the syrup half an hour, return 
the pineapple to the kettle, and boil fifteen minutes ; take 
it out, pack in wide-mouthed jars, pour on the scalding 
syrup, cover to keep in the heat, and, when cold, tie up, 
first putting brandied tissue paper on the top. 

Pineapple Jam, — Twist off the top and bottom leaves 
of the pineapples, and cut them in quarters, lengthwise, 
leaving on the skins ; grate them on a coarse grater ; the 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 420 

fikin will enable you to hold it firmly and not waste pulp 
or juice; to every pound of the grated pulp add three 
quarters of a poiind of powdered sugar ; boil and stir it 
well, until it begins to look of a clear amber color ; put 
it into jars when hot, and paper them when cold. 

Haisine de Bourgoyne (Cuisini^re Pa/risierme). — Take 
fine, sound, sweet, ripe grapes; string, and press in a 
coarse muslin bag to expel the juice ; put it on the fire 
in a porcelain-lined preserving -kettle, and boil down to 
one half the original quantity; skim and stir constantly; 
when the juice is reduced one half, put into it some fine 
pears (the Messire Jean pear is the best for this purpose), 
peeled, cored, and cut into quarters; continue boiling un- 
til the juice is reduced to a third of the original quantity, 
the pears will then be sufficiently cooked ; pour boiling- 
hot into porcelain jars; cover each jar with a plate or 
saucer, and set for twelve hours (or during the night) in 
an oven in which you have baked during the daytime. 
This is, perhaps, the best of preserves, but it is only 
possible to make it in the South, where ripe grapes are 
sweet as honey ; if made of Northern grapes you must 
add to each ten pounds of cooked juice (i. ^., boiled 
down one half) three pounds of loaf sugar ; in this case 
it is not boiled down to so thick a syrup in the- second 
boiling; small Cr^cy carrots cut into quarters may be 
substituted for pears, but must be put on at the first 
boiling of the juice, as they take longer to cook than 
pears. 

Fruits Preserved in Vinegar^ without Cooking {Cuid- 
niire Busse). — Take some of the finest cider vinegar (the 
quantity must depend upon the amount of preserves you 
wish to make), throw into this vinegar some pounded loaf 
sugar, enough to reduce the vinegar to a piquant syrup, 
which is not too sour ; when this is smooth and thick, put 
into it fine ripe peaches, pears, plums, etc., peeled, cored, 



430 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK- 

aad cut in quarters ; cover with brandied paper, etc., and 
set away in a cool, dry, dark place ; they will be fit for 
nse in a few weeks ; the fruit should be perfectly ripe, and 
the weather dry and warm. 

Watermelon Preserve. — Lay the rind of citron melon in 
salt water for three days, and then in fresh water for the 
same time ; make a syrup, allowing a pound of loaf sugar 
to one of the rind, and let the rind lie in it all night ; then 
boil all together until clear, adding green ginger, and 
lemon peel to flavor it. 

Pink Watermelon Preserve. — Cut the pink part of the 
melon into squares, and remove all the seeds with a pen- 
knife ; to one pound of fruit allow three quarters of a 
pound of loaf sugar, and let it stand for two hours ; then 
remove the fruit, and boil the syrup, skimming it care- 
fully, then put in the fruit; slice a lemon, and a few 
pieces of green ginger-root ; boil them until tender in a 
little water, and, when they are done, add them to the 
syrup ; boil it until the melon is tender and clear, and can 
be pierced with a straw; as soon as cool put into glass 
jars, and fasten tight ; it will be fit for use in six weeks. 

Bottled Plum^Sj or any Fruit' for Tarts. — Fill wide- 
mouthed bottles with the fruit, and as much cold water 
as they will hold, and cover them with bladder ; then put 
them into a kettle of hot water, first wrapping cloths or 
haybands round the bottles to prevent their touching ; let 
them get scalding hot, but not hoil ; then take the kettle 
from the fire, leaving the bottles in the water until it is 
quite cold again ; then dry the bottles, and put them away 
in a dry, cool, dark place. When the above directions are 
obeyed, the bottled fruit will be found excellent. This 
receipt is especially good for stoned fruit. The bladder 
used for covering the bottles should be soaked in water 
for forty-four hours beforehand. 



PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 431 

Brandied Orapes. — Choose large, close bunches of ripe 
grapes ; wash, and dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth; 
remove any grape that may be in the least defective ; with 
a needle prick each grape in three places ; have ready a 
suflSciency of double-refined loaf sugar powdered and sift- 
ed ; put some sugar in the bottom of a jar, then put in a 
bupch of grapes, and cover thickly with sugar ; then an- 
other bunch, then more sugar, and so on until the jar is 
nearly full, finishing . with a layer of sugar ; then fill up 
the jar with the best white brandy, c6ver as closely as pos- 
sible, and set them away. 

Brandied Cherries. — Weigh the finest Morellos, having 
cut off half the stalk ; prick them with a new needle, and 
drop them into a jar or a wide-mouthed bottle,; pound 
three fourths of their weight of rock candy, strew over, 
fill up with white brandy, and tie a bladder over. 

Brandied Peaches^ Pears^ or Plunis. — Four pounds of 
fruit, pared ; if plums, pricked ; four pounds of loaf sug- 
ar ; one pint of the best white brandy. 

Make a syrup of the sugar and just enough water to dis- 
solve it ; let this come to a boil, put the fruit in, and boil 
five minutes ; having removed the fruit carefully, let the 
syrup boil fifteen minutes longer, or until it thickens well, 
add the brandy, and take the kettle from the fire; pour 
the hot syrup over the fruit, and seal in glass jars. If, 
after the fruit is taken from the fire, a reddish liquor oozes 
from it, drain this off before adding the clear syrup. 

Brandied Berries. — Make a syrup of a pound of loaf 
sugar and half a gill of water for every two pounds of 
fruit; heat to boiling, stirring to prevent burning, and 
pour over the berries while warm, n^t hot ; cover, and let 
them stand for an hour, put all into a preserving-kettle, 
and heat slowly ; boil five minutes, take out the fruit with 
a perforated skimmer, and boil the syrup twenty minutes ; 



432 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

add a pint of brandy for every five pounds of f rait, pour 
over the berries burning hot, and seal. 

Bra/ndied Cherries d la JParisienne. — Take fine, red 
cherries, not very ripe ; cut oflE one half of the stem and 
put them into a glass jar with a small piece of cinnamon 
and a pinch of coriander seed ; add clarified sugar in the 
proportion of a pound of sugar for a pound of fruit, 
and fill up the jar with brandy, seal, and set away. They 
will be fit for use in two months. 

Hides for Canning. — Always use glass cans with good 
screw lids and gum rings. 

Use none but the best, fresh, ripe fruit. 

KoU each can in hot water before filling it, put the fruit 
or vegetable into the can scalding hot, fill to the brim, and 
screw the top on at once. 

Comned Peaclies. — Pare the peaches, stone, and cut in 
half ; as they are cut throw them immediately into glass 
jars ; have ready a cold syrup of one half pint of cold wa- 
ter to one pound of sugar ; fill the jars with this syriip 
and fasten them up ; put a large boiler oyer the fire, cover 
the bottom of it with boards, and on these set the jars of 
peaches ; fill up the boiler with cold water nearly to the 
top of the jars, and let them remain until the water bbils; 
remove them carefully, and give the lids another screwing; 
repeat the screwing in a day or two, as they sometimes slip ; 
keep in a cool, dry place. 

Canned Pears. — ^Use Seckel or Bartlett pears ; prepare 
a syrup, allowing a pint of water and a quarter of a pound 
of sugar to each quart of fruit ; as fast as you peel the 
pears, drop each into a pan of clear water ; when the syr- 
up has come to a fast boil put in the pears carefully, not 
to bruise them, and boil until they look clear and can be 
easily pierced with a fork ; have the cans ready, rolled in 



PRESEBVBS AND TRV1T JELLIES. 433 

hot water, pack with the pears^fill.to the brim with scald- 
ing syrup, and seal. 

Canned Damsons^ Grjeen Oages^ or other jPltuns.— Trick 
the plums with a needle to prevent bursting ; prepare a 
syrup, allowing to every three quarts of fruit a gill of pure 
water and a quarter of a pound of sugar; when the sugar 
is dissolved and the water is blood warm, put in the plums ; 
heat slowly ^to a boil ; let them boil five minutes, not fast, 
fill up the jars with plums, pour in the scalding syrup un- 
« til it runs down the sides, and seal. 

Canned Currants^ Cherries^ or any Berries. — Heat slow- 
ly to boiling in a large kettle ; when they begin to boil 
add one tablespoonf ul of sugar to each quart of fruit ; be- 
fore doing this dip out enough juice to leave the berries 
almost dry before putting in the sugar ; boil all together 
fifteen minutes, and can instantly. 

Fruit Jellies. — Put the fruit on in a stone jar, place this 
in a kettle of tepid water, and set on the fire ; let it boil, 
closely covered, until the fruit is broken to pieces ; strain, 
pressing the bag, a stout, coarse one, hard, putting in a few 
handfuls each time, and between each squeezing turning 
it inside out to scald off the pulp and skins ; to each pint 
of juice allow a pound of loaf sugar ; set the juice on alone 
to boil, and while it is boiling put the sugar into shallow 
dishes or pans and heat it in the oven, watching and stir- 
ring the sugar to prevent burning; boil the juice just 
twenty minutes from the time it begins fairly to boil ; by 
this time the sugar should be very hot ; throw the sugar into 
the boiling juice, stirring rapidly all the time ; withdraw 
the spoon when all is thoroughly dissolved ; let the jelly 
come to a boil to make all certain ; withdraw the kettle in- 
stantly from the fire ; roll your glasses and cups in hot wa- 
ter, and fill with the scalding liquid ; the jelly will form with- 
in an hour ; when cold close and fie up as you do preserves.

434 THE UNRfVALLED COOKBOOK. 

Currant Jelly. — ^Make precisely as above. 

ChreenrGrape Jelly. — ^Make as above, but allow a pound 
and a half of sngar to a pint of joiee. 

WUd'Cherry-and'Currant JeUy. — ^Two thirds of wild 
cherries, crushed^ stones and all ; one third of red ciUTants ; 
a pound of sngar to a pint of juice, and make as you do 
plain currant jelly. 

Black -Cap -and' Currant Jelly. — Two parts of black- 
caps, or red raspberries, and one of currants. 
Proceed as above. 

Cold Currant Jelly {Cuisiniire Parisienne). — String the 
currants and crush them in an earthen pot, taking care, 
however, not to crush the seeds; then place a fine wire 
sieve upon an earthen pot, ponr currants and juice on the 
sieve, and let the juice filter through ; when they no long- 
er drip, put them into a coarse mnslin bag, and squeeze out 
the remaining juice into another pot ; examine the juice 
carefully, and if not perfectly clear strain again; then 
weigh the juice, and allow two pounds of clarified sugar 
to one pound of juice ; mix and stir long and well until 
the amalgamation is perfect ; then cover the jar, and put 
it into a very cold cellar for twenty-four hours, going in, 
however, to stir it thoroughly at least three times during 
this period ; then ponr into small jars holding about a 
pint, cover with brandied paper, and then with bladder, 
and put into a "very cold cellar. They should not be 
touched until winter has fairly set in. This jelly is su- 
perior in flavor to any other currant jelly. 

Seeded Currants {Cuisiniire Parisienne). — String large, 
fine currants ; take up each currant carefully, and extract 
the seeds, being careful not to break the skin ; then weigh 
the fruit ; allow a pound and a half of the finest loaf sug-

ar to a pound of fruit ; put the sugar on the fire, allow- 
ing half a pint of water to each pound of sugar ; clarify 
this syrup with the white of an egg beaten into half a 
tumblerful of water; stir, skim, and cook slowly, sim- 
mering rather than boiling; put the currants into this, 
boil up once, and withdraw from tlie fire ; pour into glass

pound of currants, strung; one pound of strawberries, 
strung ; one pound of raspberries. 

Put all the fruit into a pot with four pounds of loaf 
sugar, and put over a quick fire ; boil steadily ; when the 
sugar is melted, the fruits dissolved, and the preserve be- 
gins to rise to the surface, remove the pot from the fire, 
strain through a sieve into small jars, cover with brandied 
paper, seal, and set away. The fruit may be put into oth- 
er jars as a marmalade. 

Crab-Apple Jelly. — Siberian crab apples, cut in pieces, 
but not pared or seeded ; put the fruit into a stone jar, set 
in a pot of hot water, and let it boil eight or nine hours ; 
leave in the jar all night, covered closely ; next morning 
squeeze out the juice, allow pound for pint, and make as 
you do currant jelly. 

Quince Jelly. — Pare and core the quinces, and add for 
every five pounds of fruit a cupful of water ; put peelings, 
cores, and all into a stone jar; set this in a pot of boiling 
water, and when the fruit is soft and broken, proceed as 
with other jellies. 

Peach JeUy. — Pare, stone, and slice the peaches, and put

and add when the juice has boiled twenty minutes ; let it 
come to a boil, and take instantly from the fire. 

Ripe-Grape JelZy. — One pound of sugar to each pint of 
juice. 

Proceed as for other fruit jellies. 

Strawberry Jefly. — Dip a coarse muslin bag into cold

lowing three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar to a pint 
of juice ; cook fifteen or twenty minutes, stirring often ; 
skim, and pour into jars, cover with brandied tissue paper, 
these with thick paper, and set away. 

Ro&e Jelly. — Make a clear, firm apple jelly ; just as the 
jelly is about to form, color it a bright rose color with 
cochineal, and add a drop or two of essence of rose, 
enough to give it a distinct rose flavor; stir, skim, pour 
into jars, cover as above, and set away. 

SPrawberry Jam. — Three quarters of a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit ; one pint of red-currant juice to 
every four pounds of strawberries.

PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 437 

raspberries ; ponnd for pound of loaf sugar — i. e,, equal 
weight of sugar and fruit. 

Select from the raspberries three pints of the largest 
and finest, and set them aside ; put the remainder into a 
preserving-kettle, and set them on a moderate fire to ex- 
tract the juice ; when sufliciently boiled put into a coarse 
muslin bag, and press out the juice; strain it; then put 
the sugar on to boil, with just enough water to melt it ; 
when this syrup has boiled a few minutes, and all the 
scum has been removed, throw in the whole raspberries, 
and let them simmer slowly; as soon as they begin to 
look ragged, take them out with a perforated skimmer, 
and spread upon flat dishes to cool ; throw into the syrup 
the strained juice, and let it boil until nearly a jelly; then 
throw in again the whole fruit, which has been cooling ; 
give it a short boiling, then remove the kettle from the 
fire, fill up the glasses, and, when cold, close as usual. 
This is a beautiful preserve. 

Raspberry Jam. — Three quarters of a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit; one pint of currant juice to 
every pound of fruit. 

Boil the fruit half an hour, mashing and stirring well; 
add the sugar, and cook twenty minutes more ; put up as 
you do preserves. 

Bla^lcberry Jam. — Make as above, omitting the currant 
juice. 

Apple Jam. — Weigh equal quantities of brown sugar 
and good sour apples ; pare, core, and chop them fine ;

thirds the original quantity ; pare, core, and slice juicy ap- 
ples, and put as many into the cider as it will cover. 
Boil slowly, stirring with a flat stick, and when the apples 
are tender to breaking, take them out with a perforated 
skimmer, draining them well; put in more apples, as 
many as the cider will hold, and stew them soft; take 
from the fire, put all together into a large crock, cover, and 
leave twelve hours; then return to the fire and boil down, 
stirring all the while ; spice to taste ; keep in stone jars 
in a dry, cool place. 

Pear Butter. — One peck of pears, peeled, cored, and 
chopped; five pounds of sugar (soft); half a pint of vine- 
gar ; stir as for apple butter.

quarts of best molasses. 

Stew in water first, and mash with a potato - masher ; 
stir as for apple butter. 

Tomato Butter. — Ten pounds of tomatoes, pared and 
cut up ; four pounds of brown sugar ; one quart of vinegar. 

Put the tomatoes into a preserving -kettle, add the 
sugar and the vinegar, stir all together until they become 
as thick as apple butter, stirring often to prevent burning. 



PICKLES. 

GENEBAL BULES FOB MAKING PICKLES. 

Use none but the very best vinegar ; boil in porcelain- 
lined pots ; keep in hard stoneware or glass jars ; examine 
them every month, throwing away the soft ones, and, if 
they are not keeping well, drain off and scald the vinegar, 
adding a cupful of sugar for each gallon, and pour boiling 
hot over the pickles ; if, on the contrary, the pickles are 
keeping well, throw in a liberal handful of sugar for every 
gallon ; keep the pickles always covered with vinegar.

outer leaves of the cabbage, cut in quarters, and put in a 
kettle of boiling brine; cook three minutes; take out, 
drain, and cover thickly with salt ; spread it out in the 
sun to dry, then shake off the salt, and cover with cold 
vinegar in which has been steeped enough turmeric to 
color it well ; leave it in this two weeks ; then pack in jars, 
pouring over them the seasoned vinegar ; this pickle must 
stand two months. 



440 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Sliced'Chwumber Pickle (" Common-Sense in the Honse-

vinegar for two days, setting the jar in the sun ; then pack 
carefully in glass jars, and pour over it scalding vinegar 
seasoned as follows : For each gallon of vinegar allow — 
one cupful of white sugar; a dozen blades of mace; one 
tablespoonful of celery seed; two dozen white pepper- 
corns ; two small red-pepper pods chopped fine ; a table-

it be strong enough to bear up an egg — ^for a month, stir- 
ring up every other day from the bottom ; when ready to 
pickle them, throw away the brine and the softened glier- 
kins if there are any, and soak the rest in cold, fresh water 
for twenty-four hours ; change the water and leave for the 
same length of time; line the pickle kettle with green 
vine leaves, and lay the pickles evenly within it, scattering 
a very little powdered alum (in the proportion of a pigeon's 
egg to a two-gallon kettlef ul) over each layer ; cover the 
last layer of pickles with three layers of vine leaves; cover 
closely, and steam over a slow fire five or six hours; when 
the pickles are a fine green, remove the leaves and throw 
the gherkins into ice-cold water, in which they must re- 
main while you prepare the vinegar; to each gallon of 
vinegar allow a cupful of sugar, three dozen of whole 
black peppers, the same of cloves, half as much allspice, 
and one dozen blades of mace ; boil five minutes; put the 
gherkins into a stone jar, and pour over the vinegar, scald-

gar, and return to the pickles ; repeat this process three 
times more, at intervals of two, four, and six days ; cover 
with a stoneware or wooden top, tie a strong cloth over 
this, and set away for two months in a cool, dry place.

nntil all the ingredients are well blended together, and the 
chutnee is as smooth as velvet; put into wide-mouthed 
jars or bottles, and tie down with bladder. 

Indian Pickle^ Bombay. — Take one pound of ginger, 
let it lie in wat^r one night, then scrape, and cut it in 
slices; put it in a pot with dry salt, and let it stand until 
the other ingredients are ready; peel and cut in pieces

PICKLES. 443 

must be dried in the $nn ; the cauliflowers must be scalded 
in strong brine, and then peeled, cabbage cut in, celery 
and radishes scraped, French beans and asparagus salted, 
and then scalded in salt and water, and dried in the sun ; 
in this way all sorts of fruits or greens, as they come in 
season, may be added ; as the vinegar wastes add fresh. 

Indian PicMe^ Calcutta. — Four ounces of curry-pow- 
der; four ounces of mustard seed; four large roots of 
garlic; half a pint of finest oil of Lucca; one ounce of 
chilies; three ounces of long pepper; three ounces of 
cloves ; half an ounce of allspice ; two quarts of boiling

444 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

hours; drain them again; strain your vinegar in which 
youhave steeped your celery, mustard seed, pepper, gin- 
ger, or saffron through a cloth, pressing it hard, then filter 
it through a paper; add a bottle of sweet oil for every 
three quarts of vinegar; throw in your pickles, which 
must be carefully covered ; expose your jar several days 
to the sun, and they will be fit for use. 

To Prepare French Mustard. — Pound a quart of black 
mustard seed ; mix with it equal parts of chopped parsley, 
chevril, celery, tarragon, garlic, allspice, and cloves, six 
pounded anchovies, and salt to taste; make this into a 
liquid paste, and let it stand three or four days; then 
strain it, and put it in little earthen jars ; heat a little iron 
rod red-hot, and plunge it into each jar, and let it remain 
until it becomes cold ; this is necessary to remove the bit- 
terness and dampness of the mustard ; fill in this hole 
with vinegar; cork and seal up your jars. 

PicMed Lemons, — Scrape twelve lemons wuth a silver 
knife, cut them across in quarters, not quite through, give 
them as much salt as they will hold, also rub and strew it 
over them, and let them lie in an earthen dish three or 
four days, turning them every day; then take twelve 
cloves of garlic, parboil and salt them three days, a large 
spoonful of flour of mustard, and a pinch of cayenne to 
every lemon ; take the lemons out of the salt, and put 
them into a jar with the spice, covering them with the 
best vinegar ; cover the jar very closely. They will be fit 
for use in a month. Oranges may be pickled in the same 
way.

considerably ; when cold put into bottles, pour the vinegar 
over them, and cork tightly. 

Stuffed Mangoes d la Creole (Old Dominion style). — 
Gather the small green cantelopes when they are about as 
large as your fist ; cut a little slice lengthwise out of each 
one, and take out all the seed ; then put the slice back and 
tie your maugo up carefully with a thread ; throw your 
cantelopes in a strong brine, in which you throw, also, all 
manner of vegetables fit for pickles — cucumbers, ground 
artichokes, little ears of corn, snap beans, green tomatoes, 
asparagus points, etc. ; leave them in this brine a month 
or six weeks ; watch carefully to see that they do not 
become too soft; when you are ready to make your man- 
goes, take them out of the brine, and lay them two or 
three days in fresh water to remove the salt; make a 
stuflSng of grated horseradish, white and black mustard 
seed and celery seed, ground mustard mixed with vinegar, 
green tomatoes, encumbers, in fact any of the vegetables 
you have had in pickle. It is best to prepare your onions 
a day or two in advance ; slice them and pack them in salt 
to draw out all the water, then lay them in cold water to 
take out the salt ; chop them up with the stuffing, add a 
teaspoonful of turmeric, and mix all well together with 
sweet oil and powdered black pepper, and red-pepper pods, 
chopped ; stuff your mangoes with this ; be careful to sew 
in the slices you have taken out ; pack them in a two-gal- 
lon stone jar, pour a quart bottle of sweet oil over them, 
and fill up the jar with the best vinegar ; throw in a hand- 
ful of allspice and cloves, and whole red pepper ; put a 
weight on your pickles to keep them under ; cover your 
jlir with a cotton cloth dipped in melted beeswax and ros- 
in ; let them stand six weeks before using.

boil ; remove from the fire and let the pickle cool ; when 
quite cold pour into a stone crock, and add the vegetables, 
which must be wiped dry. The vegetables need no fur- 
ther preparation, and can be put in whenever they are in 
season ; the jar should be kept closely covered. 

Easy-mixed Pickle (Old Humphrey's). — Pack into me- 
dium-sized glass jars some freshly shredded cabbage, raw 
cauliflower cut up, button onions, peeled, small red-pepper 
pods, and small cucumbers (which have lain in brine ready 
for pickling); sprinkle each layer with salt; add plenty of 
mustard seed, cloves, peppercorns, and a little allspice, all 
whole ; then make a pickle as above, omitting, liowever, 
the spices, and putting half the quantity of salt ; pour boil- 
ing hot, or as hot as the glass will bear, into the jars ; cork 
and keep in a cool, dark place. They are fit for use in six 
weeks. 

PicJded Onions (Meg Dodd's). — Take small button on- 
ions, peel them, and throw them into salt and water for 
twenty-four hours ; then put them on the fire in a porce- 
lain-lined preserving-kettle, with fresh salt and water, and 
let them come to a boil ; remove from the fire, pour off 
the water, put the onions in a large crock, and pour over 
them the scalding hot vinegar, which must have been scald- 
ed with mace, whole peppercorns, red-pepper pods, spices

low a large cupful of vinegar, two tablespoonf uls of sugar, 
a dozen whole cloves, and half a dozen blades of mace ; put 
the vinegar and sugar on to heat with the spices ; boil five 
minutes, turn out into a covered stoneware vessel, cover, 
and let it get perfectly cold ; pack the cherries into jars, 
and pour the vinegar over them when cold; cork tightly 
and set away ; they are fit for use almost immediately.

jars, and pour the syrup on boiling hot. To seven pounds 
of fruit allow four pounds of white sugar, one pint of 
strong vinegar, mace, cinnamon, and cloves to taste. Al- 
ways use whole spices for sweet pickle. Examine sweet 
pickle every other day for the first month, and if they do 
not keep well, set the uncovered jars in a kettle of boiling 
water, and heat the pickles to scalding-point. 



ICE-CREAM AND WATER-ICES. 

OENEBAL BULBS FOB IGE-CBEAM KAKING. 

Good ice-cream should be made of pure cream. If 
this be unattainable, thicken the milk with arrow-root or 
corn-starch; or make a custard (not too thick, and freeze 

it). 

The best ice cream is made of the best, rich, undiluted 
cream, and the best sugar. Three quartere of a pound of 
sugar to a quart of cream is the average. 

Pack the freezer in lumps of ice and rock salt. Never 
allow the salt to come up to the level of the freezer, lest 
it should get into the cream. After the cream has been 
in long enough to become completely chilled, turn the can 
rapidly to and fro. From time to time remove the top, 
and beat and stir the cream vigorously with a long wooden 
paddle, scraping it off the sides ; pursue this course until 
the cream becomes thick ; when too stiff to beat or stir, 
cover the can securely to keep out the salt, and fill the top 
with broken ice. 

These directions apply to the old-fashioned freezer. 
But it is better to get always the latest invention. The 
present freezers beat, stir, scrape, and freeze, all at once, 
well and quickly. 

Almond Ice-^sream, — Three pints of fresh, rich cream ; 
sugar to taste ; one tablespoonf ul of corn-starch, wet with 
cold water ; three ounces of sweet almonds, and one ounce

spoonfuls of orange-flower water. 

Heat one pint of the cream almost to boiling, add the 



462 THE UNRIVALLED ^ COOK-BOOK. 

sugar, and, when this is melted, the almonds ; simmer ten 
minutes, remove from the fire, and let it all stand ten 
minues in a covered jar ; strain, return to the fire, and stir 
in the arrow-root for five minutes ; when cold, beat light 
with an egg-whip, adding gradually the rest of the cream ; 
then freeze. 

Custard Ice-crecmi. — ^Make a rich custard, flavor to taste ; 
make it sweeter than usual, and freeze. 

Pistachio Ice-cream. — Make a pistachio custard, sweeter

a pint of milk ; sugar to taste ; one third of a cake of 
chocolate, grated ; a little vanilla. 

Beat the cream until stiff, then add the milk, sugar, 
flavoring, and chocolate; then beat again hard and long, 
and freeze, stirring until so hard that you can do so na 
longer; the more rapidly it is stirred the finer will be its 
grain. 

Coffee in Cream.^Three pints of creani ; one cupful of 
black coffee, very strong and clear; two cupfuls of sugar; 
two tablespoonfuls of arrow-root moistened with cold milk. 

Heat one half the cream to boiling, then stir in the 
sugar, and, when this is nearly melted, the coffee, then the 
arrow- root; boil five minutes, stirring constantly; when 
cold, whip as light as possible, whipping in the rest of the 
cream by degrees : then freeze.

more sugar. 

Ra^pbei^ Ice-cream — Is made in the same manner as 
strawberry. 

Peach Ice-cream. — Use rich, fresh cream, and the finest

Steep three hours in a cov^ered pitcher ; if too thick, put 
in cold water with the lemon juice and sugar. Excellent 
for colds. 

IrishrMoss Lemonade (Iceland moss is equally good). — 
One handful of Irish moss, washed in five waters ; two 
quarts of boiling water, poured on the moss, and left until 
cold ; two lemons peeled and sliced, leaving out the peel ; 
sweeten well, and ice. 

Do not strain, and if it thickens too much add cold wa- 
ter. Good for feverish colds and all pulmonary troubles. 

Lemon Water. — Peel very carefully and thinly one large 
lemon, put it into a jug with a lump of sugar, pour over 
it one quart and a half of boiling water, let it stand till 
cold, strain, and it is ready for use. More lemon peel may 
be used. It is best to make it overnight, and let it stand 
until morning. 

Apple Water — Is made in the same way, but more peel, 
of course, is required. It is best to use the tart apples. 

Quince Water. — Peel and cut up into quarters two large 
quinces ; pour over them one quart and a half of boiling 
water; let it stand all night, then drain, and sweeten. 
This is very good for colds. 

Caudle. — Take one paper of Kobinson's prepared groats; 
make it perfectly smooth from lumps ; add a large table- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon, half a teaspoonf ul of ground

mace, half a nutmeg, and two large cupfuls of powdered 
sugar ; mix all well together, and then add, gradually, wa- 
ter until it is smooth and rather thin ; have half a gallon 
of water boiling on the fire with half a pound of stoned 
raisins ; take out the raisins, and add the groats ; when the 
whole nearly boils, add three pints of sherry wine and the 
juice of five or six lemons ; boil all together, put the rai- 
sins in a stone jar, and strain the caudle over them. Wine, 
sugar, or lemons may be added at any time before the final 
boiling; stir constantly for fear of burning; serte hot in 
small cups. 

Clove Tea. — Six whole cloves ; one tumblerful of boil- 
ing water. Cover closely and leave all night ; then strain 
and drink. 

Violet Tea (" Tisane de VioUttes^^). (Good to induce 
perspiration.)— Half an ounce of dried violets put into two 
pints of boiling water ; let them stand near the fire half an 
hour; then strain and use. 

Mint Tea, — Take half an ounce of green mint leaves, 
crush, and infuse in boiling water; sweeten, and, when 
cold, strain. It is healing to the stomach and bowels. 
Rosemary, balsam, and southernwood teas may be made 
in the same way. 

Catmp Tea. — Make as above. Good for colds and colic. 

Aniseed Tea. — Make as above. Good for colds and 
colic. 

Fennel Seeds Steeped in Brandy. — Good for colds and 
colic. 

Ta/asy-andrBue Tea. — Make in the same way as "Mint 
Tea." Good for colds and colic. 



486 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Chamomile and Gentian Teas — Are made in the same 
way as " Mint Tea," and are excellent tonics, taken cold 
or hot. 

Pennyroyal Tea. — Make in the same way as "Mint 
Tea." Good to induce perspiration. 

Tea of Parsley Boot — Parsley root, scraped and steeped 
in boiling water, is good for strangury and kindred affec- 
tions, as is, also, tea of dried pumpkin seeds. 

Pose Tea, — Half an ounce of red rosebuds (the white 
heels being taken off) ; three tablespoonf uls of white wine 
vinegar ; one ounce of white sugar candy. 

Pour over these ingredients two pints of boiling water; 
.let them stand near the fire for two hours, then strain. 
Similar acid drinks may be made of apple jelly, guava jel- 
ly, damson cheese, currant jelly, or syrup of gooseberries, 
barberries, etc. 

Sa^e Tea. — Half an ounce of fresh, green sage leaves, 
plucked from the stalks, and washed clean ; one ounce of 
sugar ; a quarter of an ounce of outer rind of finely pared 
lemon peel. 

Pour over these ingredients two pints of boiling wa- 
ter, let them stand near the fire an hour, then strain; 
when the sage is dried, less than half an ounce must be 
used. 

Oatmeal Tea. — One handful of oatmeal ; one gallon of 
boiling water. 

Mix in a deep vessel ; let the oatmeal subside, which it 
does in half an hour ; then pour off the tea. By this proc- 
ess hard water is made digestible. 

Tea of Green 8t/rawberry Leaves. — A good wash for a 
cankered mouth. 



DIETARY FOR INFANTS AND INVALIDS. 487 

Sage Tea — Sweetened with honey, and with a small bit 
of alum dissolved in it, is an excellent gargle for sore 
throat. 

Cleansing Wash for the Mouth hefore Food.— One table- 
spoonful of Condy's solution in a pint of tepid water. 

White Wine Whey^ No. 1. — One quart of new milk ; 
one gill of sherry. 

Put the milk in a saucepan, and stir it over a clear fire 
until it is nearly boiling; then add the sherry, and sim- 
mer for a quarter of an hour, skimming off the curd as it 
rises ; then add a tabkspoonf ul more of sherry, and skim 
again for a few minutes. 

White Wine Whey^ No. 2. — One pint of fresh milk; two 
wineglassfuls of Madeira wine. 

Put on the milk, and when it boils throw in the wine 
and let it come again to a boil ; strain without stirring it. 
The quantity of wine must be regulated by the advice of 
a physician; less than one glassful of wine will not turn 
a pint of milk to whey. If the wine whey must be very 
weak, add whey turned with rennet to dilute it. 

Sennet Whey. — One quart of new milk, warm from the 
cow, if possible ; one large tablespoonf ul of rennet. 

Heat the milk (if it be not warm from the cow) to the 
same temperature, add the rennet, keep up the heat a lit- 
tle higher until the curd separates, and take it off with a 
spoon. 

Tamarind Whey. — Boil two ounces of tamarinds in two 
pints of milk, strain, and serve. It may be taken cold or 
hot. 

Bestorative Jelly (" Boston Cook-Book ''). — Two calf 's- 
f eet ; two quarts of cold water ; half a cupful of sugar ; 



488 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

one lemon ; one inch of stick cinnamon ; one and a h]alf 
eggs, whites and shells; one cupful of port wine; two 
cloves ; one tablespoonf ul of powdered gum-arabic. 

Scald the feet and clean thoroughly; split, break the 
bones, and put them into cold water; heat slowly, and 
simmer gently until reduced to a pint and a half ; strain, 
and when cold remove the fat ; add the other ingredients 
except the wine ; put it over the fire and stir until hot ; 
let it boil five minutes, or until a thick scum has formed ; 
set it back on the stove, skim, and add the wine; strain 
through a fine napkin into a shallow dish ; when cool and 
firm cut with a silver knife into small squares. This is 
good for a very weak patient or an^ld person. 

Baked Lemon ar Orange, — Bake a lemon or sour orange 
twenty minutes in a moderate oven ; when done, cut open, 
take out the inside, and eat with sugar or molasses. Ex- 
cellent for hoarseness. 

jPor^fo^^r^a("BostonOook.Book").— Two pounds 
of lean beef, cut fine ; half a box of gelatine. 

Soak together in one pint of cold water one hour, squeez- 
ing often ; heat to nearly the boiling-point ; strain, press- 
ing all the juice from the meat ; fill a glass jar with the 
juice, place the jar in water, and heat until the water out- 
side the jar boils; seal while hot; dissolve two teaspoon- 
f uk of the above preparation in half a cupful of hailing 
water^ add a few grains of salt, and serve at once. This 
is a convenient form of food for travellers. 

Broiled 'Beef Essence. — Broil half a pound of round 
steak one or two minutes, or until the juice will flow ; cut 
it into small pieces ; squeeze the juice into a heated bowl 
placed in hot water ; salt and serve.

cupful of boiling water to the essence. 



DIETABY FOR INFANTS AND INVALIDS. 489 

Laban (" Boston Cook-Book "). — One quart of new milk ; 
one tablespoonful of yeast stirred into the milk. 

Let it stand in a cool place to harden, which will take 
from three to twenty-four hours ; when hard take a table- 
spoonful of the mixture and stir it into new milk, and then 
set away to harden again. This is " Laban." It should 
be eaten with sugar and cream. If a constant supply be 
needed, reserve one tablespoonful each day for the next 
preparation. It is both palatable and digestible. 

Com Tea and Rice Coffee (" Boston Cook-Book "). — 
Brown one cupful of dried sweet corn or rice ; pound or 
grind it fine ; add one pint of cold water and steep one 
hour; strain, and serve with sugar and cream. They are 
pleasant and nourishing beverages. 

Gluten Oems (" Boston Oook-Book "). — Two cupf uls of 
gluten ; half a teaspoonful of salt ; two teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing-powder ; two tablespoonf uls of sugar ; one egg ; two

GENERAL HINTS FOR THE SICK- 
ROOM. 

An open fireplace, and in winter an open fire, are neces- 
sary. A candle, of the best quality, is the only safe light* 
Lamps of all kinds should be avoided. 

The bed should be placed so as to command a good view 
of the room, as it frequently makes a patient nervous to 
hear any movement going on behind the bed. Draughts 
must be carefully avoided, and neither sun nor candle al- 
lowed to shine full on the bed. 

In visiting a sick person stand or sit near the foot of the 
bed, so that the patient need make no effort to see you. 
It is distressing to invalids to have people too close to 
them, or to have them sit near the head of the bed, so that 
the invalid is obliged to turn round and look upwards. 
Never wear creaking shoes or a rustling garment. Next 
to perfect, immaculate cleanliness, comes complete silence. 

If it be necessary to replenish a coal fire, avoid noise by 
putting the coal into a paper bag, and putting bag and all 
on the fire. 

Never keep soiled clothes or food of any kind in a sick- 
room. If two beds are used, keep the mattress and 
blankets of the odd bed in another room, exposed to air 
and sunlight, and make up the bed freshly just before you 
move the patieni, then carry away at once the mattress, 
pillows, blankets, etc., and put them in another room to 
air ; cover the palliasse or springs of the empty bed with a 
neat coverlet so that it may present a decent appearance. 
Keep all food well covered up in an adjoining room, which 
should be well aired. 



GENERAL HINTS FOR THE SICK-ROOM. 491 

In sweeping a sick-room envelop the broom in a cotton- 
flannel bag wet with cold water ; it should be put on with 
the nap side out. Always dust a sick-room with a damp 
cloth. 

Never enter a sick-room when in a violent perepiration, 
or with an empty stomach, as then the system more readily 
receives contagion. If obliged to sit up all night, provide 
yourself with something to eat, if only a cake of choco- 
late. 

TO KEEP ICE IN A SICK-ROOM (" BOSTON COOK-BOOK "). 

Tie a square of coarse white flannel over a pitcher, leav- 
ing a cup-shaped depression in the centre, fill this with 
broken ice, and cover tightly with a thicker flannel ; it will 
keep well. 

HOT BANDAGES- 

In applying hot bandages, dip the flannel in boiling 
water, place it in the centre of a coarse towel, and twist 
and wring the ends of the towel; or, place the flannels in a 
steamer over hot water until penetrated with the steam ; 
they will then need no wringing. 

CONVENIENCES IN A SICK-EOOM. 

In severe sickness a glass tube is useful for feeding 
drinks and gruels, and little white china boats with spouts 
are also good ; a wooden tray, with legs six or seven inches 
high, to stand on the bed, is useful for serving meals. 

GENEEAL HINTS AS TO DIET FOR INVALIDS (BOSTON COOK- 
BOOK "). 

Milk should enter largely into the diet of children and 
invalids; it should be used with discretion, and not drunk 
too fast ; a large glass of milk swallowed suddenly will 
form in the stomach a lump of dense, cheesy curd, which 
may even prove fatal to a weak stomach. Under the ac- 
tion of the stomach this cheesy mass will turn over and 



492 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

over like a heavy weight, and as the gastric juice can only 
attack its surface it digests slowly ; but this same milk, 
taken slowly, or with dry toast, light rolls, or soft, dry 
porridge, forms a porous lump through which the gastric 
juice can easily pass, and which breaks up every time the 
stomach turns it over. Milk should be very slightly salt- 
ed, and eaten with breadstuflEs, or sipped by the spoonful. 
Cow's milk produces less heat than human milk; a child 
will grow thin upon it unless a little sugar be added. 
Wheat flour has such an excess of heat-producing power 
as to fatten a child unduly, and should have cow's milk 
added to it to reduce its fattening power. 

Vanilla should never be used as a flavoring for invalids. 
Pepper, in small quantities, is allowable, but only white or 
cayenne pepper, never black. 

Boiled onions are soothing to the mucous membrane; 
in inflammation of the stomach they are healthful when a 
piece of white bread could not be digested. Broiled or 
roasted squab, venison, chicken, mutton, and beef, in the 
order given, are the most easily assimilated meats. 

Game, being rich in phosphates, is valuable for invalids. 
Broiled bacon, dusted with cayenne, is an easily digested 
form of fat. 

Tomatoes are very healthy, and are considered by many 
physicians a remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion. Wa- 
tery, green, or diseased potatoes should never be eaten ; 
young potatoes are indigestible. 

Eggs for sick people should be taken raw, boiled very 
lightly, or boiled very hard; when cooked in any other 
manner they are indigestible. 

Soups which have in them cream or milk are better for 
invalids than those rich in gelatine. Cream of celery and 
Potage d la Heine Victoire are particularly good. 

Strong bouillon is adapted to those suffering from 
hemorrhoids, or any disease of the rectum, as there is no 
solid waste. 
Diabetica should abstain from sugar, and anything which 



GENERAL HINTS FOR THE SICK-ROOM. 493 

IB converted into sngar in digestion, such as all starchy 
foods and vegetables. 

The corpvlent should abstain from fat, sugar, and starchy 
foods. 

The hiliovs and gouty should eat sparingly of brown 
meats, cheese, eggs, beans, pease, or food which is rich in 
albuminoids. 

The constipated should avoid fried or greasy foods, hot 
bread, rich cake, veal, pork, coarse oatmeal, etc. 

Those people who have consumptive tendencies should 
eat wholesome, easily digested and assimilated food, with 
plenty of fat, i. e.^ cream, sweet butter, fat of roast or 
boiled meat, salads, cornmeal, oatmeal, etc. 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDI- 
CAL RECEIPTS. 

HOUSEHOLD RECEIPTS. 

To Preserve Eggs, — Slake a lump of lime, making the 
mixture as thick as ordinary whitewash ; let it stand three 
weeks ; pack the eggs carefully in a jar, or any vessel that 
will hold the liquid. 

To Preserve Milk. — Bottle the milk tightly, using wine 
corks; place them in a kettle of cold water; heat the 
water gradually until it reaches boiling-point; then re- 
move the kettle from the fire and allow it to cool ; then 
pack the bottles for future use; milk prepared in this 
manner will keep for six months. 

To Preserve Lime Juice. — Strain the juice, and to every 
pint add one pound of double-refined sugar; let it stand 
in the sun ; as the scum rises, skim it oS, and when it is 
quite free from scum put into pint bottles and cork it 
well; it will keep for months. 

To Clean Wine Bottles. — Put some shot in the bottles, 
fill them half full of water, and shake the shot about until 
the bottle is thoroughly cleaned ; the water had better be 
changed two or three times during the process ; be very 
careful not to leave any shot in the bottles, as the acid of 
the wine acts on it poisonously. 

To Clean Brasses. — Grate Bath brick to a fine powder, 
saturate it with alcohol, and rub on the brass with a rag, 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL EECEIPTS. 495 

until it is quite bright and clean ; finish polishing with a 
chamois cloth. 

To Clean Straw Matting. — Wash with a cloth dipped 
in clean salt and water ; wipe dry at once, or it will turn 
yellow. 

To Clean Paint — Use a rather soft, flat brush, warm 
water, and plenty of suds ; wash off the suds with a flannel 
cloth dipped in cold water, and dry with a clean cloth. 
Paint should always be washed and dried quickly. 

To Bemove Stains from Marble. — ^Make a mortar of 
unslacked lime and very strong lye ; cover the spot thickly 
with it, and leave it on for six weeks ; wash it off perfect- 
ly clean, and rub hard with a brush dipped in a lather of 
soap and water ; polish with a smooth, hard brush. 

To Cleam, a Ma/rble Floor. — If not very dirty, the plan 
adopted in Italy is the best. The Italians use clean, fresh 
sawdust, slightly dampened. This cleans a marble floor 
quickly and well ; if the floor be of cement, dark in col- 
or, and varnished to imitate mosaic, the Italians clean as 
above, and polish with flannel cloths, dipped in oil and 
vinegar. 

Stains of Iron Mould. — Moisten with ink, and, while 
wet, rub in muriatic acid, diluted with five times its weight 
of water. 

Ink Stains. — If wet, wash in skim milk, then in cold 
water, then again in hot. For dry ink stains use oxalic 
acid, or lemon juice and salt. 

Mildew. — Equal parts of lemon juice, salt, powdered 
starch, and soft soap ; rub on thickly, and lay on the grass 
in the hot sun ; repeat this process two or three times a day. 



496 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Stadna of Acids and Alkalies, — Treat acid stains with 
hartshorn ; alkaline with acids. 

Stains on Silk or Woollen. — Moisten with the scouring 
spirit, and rub until the spot disappears. 

To Wash Black Goods. — Eip the stuflE, and select the best 
for cleaning; buy five cents' worth of pulverized soap bark, 
and let it stand in a little water until dissolved ; put the 
black stuff in enough lukewarm water to cover it, turn in 
the soap bark, rinse the stuff up and down until it is quite 
saturated, then rinse in clear lukewarm water. The effect 
upon bunting is remarkable, cleansing and restoring ; but 
various black stuffs may be cleaned in this way. 

To Clean Black Goods. — Two parts of soft water ; one 
part of alcohol or turpentine. 

Wash with a well-soaped sponge dipped in the mixture ; 
rub both sides of the stuff, stretching it on a table ; sponge 
off with clear hot water, and iron on the wrong side, and 
while damp. 

To Wash Silk. — Mix well two cupfuls of cold water, 
one tablespoonful of strained honey, one tablespoonful of 
soft-soap, and one wineglassful of alcohol. 

Shake up well, lay the silk on a table; sponge each 
breadth on both sides, rubbing well ; then shake about 
well in a tub of cold water ; flap dry, but do not wring it ; 
hang by the edges until fit to iron, and iron on the wrong 
side while damp. 

To Smooth Wrinkled Silk. — Sponge on the right side 
with very weak gum-arabic and water, and iron on the 
wrong side. 

To Wash Woollens. — Wash in clean, hot soap suds, rinse 
out in clear hot water, and shake, but do not wring. 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 497 

To Wash Lawn or Thin Muslin. — Two quarts of wheat 
bran ; six quarts of watef. 

Boil half an hour, strain, and mix in the water in which 
the muslin is to be washed ; if possible, use neither soap 
nor starch ; rinse lightly in clear water. This preparation 
both cleanses and stifiens. 

To Wash DouUful CaUooes. — One teaspoonful of sugar 
of lead ; one pailful of water. 

Mix, put in the calico, and soak fifteen minutes before 
washing. 

To Wash Tidies made of Antique Lace, — Soak in borax 
water, then let them lie in warm suds, squeezing them in 
your hands ; rinse, but do not blue them ; instead of iron- 
ing them, pull them in shape and pin to a clean cloth on 
your ironing-board; let them get quite dry before re- 
moving them. 

To Wash Black Lace, — Half a cupful of rain water ; one 
teaspoonful of borax ; one tablespoonf ul of spirits of wine. 

Squeeze the tumbled rusty lace through this four times, 
then rinse in a cupful of hot water, in which a black kid 
glove has been boiled ; pull out the edges of the lace, and 
put under pressure for two days. 

To Wash White Lace Edging. — Cover a quart bottle 
with linen, stitched smoothly to fit the shape ; begin at the 
bottom and wind the lace about it, basting fast at both 
edges, even the minutest point, to the linen ; wash on the 
bottle, soaping it well ; rinse by plunging in a pail of fair 
water, and boil as you would a white handkerchief, bottle 
and all ; set in the sun to dry ; when quite dry, clip the 
basting threads, and use without ironing. 

To Henew Wrinkled Crape. — Stretch over a basin of 
boiling water, holding it smooth, but not tight, over the 



498 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

top, until the steam fairly penetrates it ; fold while damp, 
and put under pressure. 

To ResUyre the Pile of Velvet. — If but slightly pressed, 
treat as you would crape ; if badly crushed, wet on the wrong 
side, and pass the wet side of the velvet slowly over the 
flat surface of a hot iron ; as the steam rises to the right 
side it will raise the pile with it ; dry without handling. 

To Curl Tumbled Feathers. — Hold over a hot fire, 
not hot enough to burn ; shake out, and heat again until 
curled. 

To Keep Woollens. — Beat, brush, and sun for a day; 
shake hard, fold neatly, and pin in papers which have been 
dipped in turpentine, and then' dried ; put a lump of gum 
camphor in each bundle. Or, sew closely in muslin or linen 
cloths, and pack in whiskey barrels. 

To Make Soft Soap. — Ten pounds of grease; six pounds 
of washing soda or wood ashes ; eight gallons of hot water. 

Let it stand until the grease is eaten up; if too thick, 
add more water ; stir every day ; if wood ashes are used, 
boil the mixture. 

Mixture for Sponging WooUen Goods. — Two ounces of 
ammonia ; two ounces of castile soap, white; one ounce of 
glycerine ; one ounce of ether. 

Cut the soap fine, dissolve in one pint of water over the 
fire; then add two quarts of water and the other in- 
gredients ; mix and stir well, and bottle. This should be 
mixed with water in the proportion of a teacupful to an 
ordinary pail of water ; mix thoroughly, and wash soiled 
garments in it. For removing spots, use a sponge or clean 
flannel cloth, and with a dry cloth rub as dry as possible. 
Woollen goods may be made to look bright and fresh by 
being sponged with this. 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 499 

To Prevent Lamjpwicks from Smoking. — Lampwicks 
should be soaked in good vinegar, and afterwards thor- 
oughly dried ; they will burn perfectly well, and will never 
smoke if this process is adopted. 

ToMemove Cheasefroni Carpets. — Take some oxgall from 
the butcher's, put it in water, and wash the carpets with it. 

To Remove Port and Claret Stains. — Cover the stain 
thickly with salt, and, when dry, wet them again with 
sherry before washing in hot water. 

To Clean a Furred Teorkettle. — Put a few spoonfuls 
of ammonia in water, and boil in the tea-kettle. It will 
cleanse it thoroughly. 

To Sweeten Bitter Yeast. — Wash a poker clean, and 
dry it ; then heat it red-hot, and thrust it red-hot into the 
yeast. It will not fail to sweeten it. 

To Restore Worn Steel Pens. — Heat the pen in gas- 
light, and dip instantly into cold water. It will make it 
as good as new. 

Clothes Catching Fire. — Throw yourself instantly on the 
floor, and roll yourself in a rug or blanket, if you have one. 
Children should be taught this as soon as they are able to 
understand. 

To Escape from a Burning Place. — If you have to pass 
by flames, muffle the mouth and nose in wet bandages or 
thick woollen, and creep on allfours^ no matter how great 
the haste, as the cold air falls to the floor, and one can 
breathe there when it is impossible elsewhere. Children 
should be early taught this also. 

To Draw Out a Broken Needle. — If no surgeon be at 



600 THE UNBIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

hand, and all other remedies fail, a broken needle may be 
drawn out of the flesh in which it has embedded itself by 
the action of a strong magnet, which should be applied to 
the skin. 

Plants in a Room. — A. few plants add rather to the 
health of a room than otherwise, as they give out oxygen 
and inhale carbonic acid ; but many plants produce a slight 
malaria. Neither plants nor cut flowers should be allowed 
to remain overnight in a sleeping-room. 

For Staining Wooden Floors. — The he^t plain staining- 
fluid is permanganate of potash. It not only stains, but 
purifies, being the foundation of a powerful disinfectant. 
Buy wholesale ; dissolve one and a half ounces in a gallon 
of boiling water (this will make quite a dark stain) ; stir 
the^mixttire thoroughly with a stick, and lay it on with a 
painter's flat brush, a large one, working the way of the 
grain of the wood quickly and boldly. A small brush 
should be used for corners and crevices. When dry the 
staining can be repeated if it is not dark enough. The 
floor should then be rubbed over with a woollen duster, 
and linseed oil should be rubbed on freely with a piece of 
flannel, always following the grain of the wood. Two or 
three layers of linseed oil should be laid on, as this sets the 
stain ; it is then ready to be polished with beeswax and 
turpentine. To prepare this, cut up the beeswax into 
small pieces, put it into a pot, and pour sufficient tur- 
pentine over it to cover it ; set the pot in the oven, or on 
the stove, until the wax is thoroughly melted ; then leave 
it to get cold, when it should be of the consistency of po- 
matum ; rub on the wax, not too much of it, with a piece 
of flannel, and then polish with a polishirig-brush. The 
best kind are the weighted ones with long handles, as they 
do not entail so much stooping ; but other kinds, not so 
expensive, are easily to be obtained. This method of 
treating floors is quite the best and most wholesome for 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 601 

bedroomsj which should be stained uniformly all over. 
They can be kept very clean and bright by rubbing daily 
with a duster, and by a weekly application of beeswax and 
turpentine. After these floors are once well polished, they 
require but little labor — not more than scrubbing floors or 
washing oilcloths. 

To Bestore Scorched Linen. — If linen has been scorched 
in ironing, and the mark has not gone through so as to 
damage the texture, it may be removed by the following 
process : Take two onions, peel, slice, and pound them to 
extract the juice ; then cut up half an ouuce of white 
soap and two ounces of fuller's-earth ; mix with them the 
onion juice and half a pint of vinegar ; boil this composition 
well, then spread it ; when cool cover the scorched part of 
the linen, and let it dry on ; afterwards wash out the linen. 

To Shrink Flannel. — Dip the flannel into boiling wa- 
ter, taking care to saturate it thoroughly ; shake, but do 
not wring, and at once hang it up in the sun to dry. It 
will never shrink again. 

Tour Own Mason. — Small holes in white walls can be 
easily repaired by mixing equal parts of plaster of Paris 
and white sand (scouring sand) to a paste; mix a small 
quantity at a time, and apply with a knife or flat piece of 
wood. This cement hardens at once, and is very durable. 

To Extinguish Kerosene Flames. — If no cloth is at 
hand, throw flour on the flames. Flour rapidly absorbs 
the fluid, and deadens the flame. 

To Prevent Horsed Feet from Scalding or Cra^cking. — 
Coat the hoofs once a week with an ointment consisting 
of equal parts of soap fat, yellow wax, linseed oil, Yenice 
turpentine, and Norway tar ; melt the wax separately be- 
fore mixing. 



602 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

To Preserve Sheepskins for Mats, — Dissolve one pound 
of alam and one pound of salt in a gallon of water; put 
the skin in soon after it is taken from the sheep, and let it 
soak twenty-four hours ; then nail it on an old door, skin 
uppermost, till quite dry ; line it with a piece of old car- 
pet (after cutting it straight) to prevent the possibility of 
its greasing the floor. 

General Scouring Spirit — One ounce of pyroligneous 
ether; three drachms of tlie essence of lemon. 

Mix, moisten the grease-spot in silk or cloth well with 
this mixture, and rub it until it disappears. 

To Drive away Bats. — Chloride of lime is an infalli- 
ble preventive, as rats flee from its odor as from a pesti- 
lence. It should be thrown down their holes, and spread 
about wherever they are likely to come. It should be re- 
newed once a fortnight. 

To Drive away Mosquitoes. — Some of the Vene- 
tian mosquito powder burned in the room is very ef- 
fective. 

Or, if the herb called pennyroyal can be obtained, a 
bunch of it tied at the head of the bed will drive the mos- 
quitoes away. 

To Drive away any Insect which Infests Woodwork 
or Iron. — The following receipt was given me by a well- 
known dealer in antique furniture in Florence. He told 
ine that it never failed, and that he had often used it 
on old pieces of furniture, which, to use his own expres- 
sion, " walked away of themselves." 

jiEqua McBstra. — For every quart of pure water one 
ounce of potash. Mix and stir until thoroughly dissolved, 
but do not boil it. 

Smell of Paint. — To get rid of the smell of oil paint, 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 603 

put a handful of hay into a pailful of water, and let it 
stand in a room newly painted. 

To Render Awnings Waterproof. — Plunge the awning 
first into a solution containing twenty per cent, of soap, 
and then into another solution containing the same per- 
centage of sulphate of copper ; then wash, and the opera- 
tion is accomplished. 

Glue for Beady Use. — To any quantity of glue use 
common whiskey instead of water; put both in a bottle, 
cork tightly, and set away for three or four days; it will 
then be fit for use. 

To Purify Foul Water. — Where a filter is unattainable, 
a very little alum will purify foul water. An ounce of 
alum will purify a whole hogshead of foul water. 

To Soften, Hard Water. — Where soda is not obtainable 
or advisable, use wood ashes. It never fails to soften 
hard water, as it contains carbonate of potassa, which, 
uniting with the sulphate of lime, forms a substance which 
falls to the bottom, leaving the water soft. 

Bad Drmhing Water. — ^Wherever the drinking water 
is not absolutely beyond suspicion, it should invariably be 
boiled and filtered before using. This treatment will make 
almost any water safe. 

To Manage a ^' Bain-marie.'^^ — If the hain-marie {i. e., 
the water in the outside kettle) does not boil as quickly as 
it ought, it is better to fill the outside kettle with brine, 
which always boils more quickly. 



TOILET RECEIPTS. 

Lol/ionfoT Freckles. — One teacupf ul of sour milk ; a lit- 
tle scraped horseradish. 



504 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK.

pan of boiling water, one ounce of white wax, one ounce 
of pure spermaceti, and one gill of oil of almonds well 
stirred in ; add to this, when it begins to grow cool, half 
.a drachm of essential oil of almonds; lialf a drachm of 
expressed oil of mace, and half a drachm of balsam of 
Peru ; stir until smooth and perfectly amalgamated ; then 
pour into egg-cups; turn out when hard. These balls 
passed oyer the clean and dry skin at bedtime greatly 
improve the softness of the complexion. 

Glycerine JBalsam.—JLslt an ounce of white wax ; one 
ounce of spermaceti ; one gill of oil of almonds. 

Melt slowly in a porcelain kettle, and when melted and 
stirred smooth add one ounce and a half of glycerine that

sam of Peru, or by sixteen drops of attar of roses ; stir 
constantly until cold ; then pour into china jars. 

Cold Creanij No. 1. — Take a quarter of ah ounce of white 
wax, and shred it into a basin with one ounce of almond oil ; ' 
place the basin by the fire until the wax is dissolved ; then

water incorporate, and continue beating until it is accom- 
plished ; then pour into jars for use. 

Cold Oream, No. 2. — Take one pound of the best lard 
and four ounces of spermaceti.

of flowers of sulphur into one quart of clear, cold water; 
agitate often for several hours ; then pour off the liquid 
and saturate the scalp witli it every morning. 

Pomade Dimne. — Take four pounds of mutton suet, one 
pound of white wax, an ounce and a half each of essence 
of bergamot and essence of lemon, and half an ounce each 
of oil of lavender and oil of origanum.

in the other ingredients. The origanum has considerable 
power in stimulating the growth of the hair. 

Rosemary Tea for the Hair. — Bruise a branch of rose- 
mary, pour one pint of .boiling water over it, and use it 
warm every morning. This will do for several times.

tions; inelt in a water bath, strain (through coarse lace) 
and decant, leaving the dregs behind ; after which, when 
nearly cool, add a few drops of attar of roses, and stir un- 
til the whole is set.

ram ; add a few bay leave*; put in, also, a quarter of a 
pound of bag salt, pounded, one ounce of orris root, sliced, 
one ounce of cloves, one ounce each of cinnamon, of gum 
benjamin, and storax, and a quarter of a pound of angeli- 
ca root, sliced ; when the ingredients are mixed, cover tlie 
jar close and let it stand for a week. The scent is deli- 
cious. 

MEDICAL RECEIPTS.

Lead. — One pint of water ; two ounces of Epsom salts. 
Mix, and give a wineglassful every ten minutes, until it 
operates freely. 

Iodine, — Large quantities of starch and water. 

Oreen Vitriol. — Give an emetic; afterwards magnesia 
and water. 

Lunar Caustic. — One large-teaspoonf ul of common salt 
in a glassful of water, and repeat in ten minutes ; then a 
dose of castor oil, and barley water to drink.

warm water, with magnesia, or flour stirred in ; no oil or 
fat of any description. 

Poisonous Fish. — An emetic ; then a full dose of castor 
oil, with some warm spice; a mustard plaster on the pit 
of the stomach. 

Poisonous Plants^ Mushrooms^ etc. — An emetic ; when 
the stomach is emptied give a good dose of castor oil; 
stimulants, if the patient be faint. 

Laudanum. — ^Empty the stomach by an emetic; for an 
adult give fifteen grains of sulphate of zinc in a little 
water; to a young person half the quantity; to an infant, 
a teaspoonf ul of syrup of ipecac ; if ho drugs are at hand, 
use mustard and warm water, or salt and water, and tickle 
the top of the throat ; after vomiting, give plenty of very 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL EECEIPTS. 609 

strong coffee ; put a mustard plaster round the calf of each 
leg, and, if faint and cold, give spirits and water; remem- 
ber to keep the patient awake, at all hazards ; after an 
overdose of laudanum, sleep is death. 

To Stop the Flow of Blood. — Bathe the cut with 
ordinary red wine; then cover the wound with either 
whiting, pipe-clay, or cobwebs and brown sugar ; if you 
have none of these, apply the fine dust of tea, or, if all are 
wanting, a handful of earth held tightly. to the wound 
until help can be obtained; if the cut is deep, it is wise 
not only to bandage it tightly, but to tie another bandage 
dihove^ not helow^ the wound. 

To Treat Stings. — Extract the sting ; then apply at 
once a little bluing, slightly moistened with water ; if 
the inflammation is great, poultice. 

Bite of a Snake. — Tie a string tightly above the wound ; 
wash, and suck it ; then burn the wound to the very bot- 
tom with lunar caustic, or iron heated to a white heat; 
stimulants, preferably whiskey, must be given in large 
quantities. 

Sunstroke. — Bind the head with wet cloths ; wet another 
cloth, fold into a small square, cover thickly with salt, and 
apply to the back of the neck ; apply dry salt behind the 
ears, and mustard plasters to the calves of the legs and

tism, sprains, etc.). — One ounce of yellow bar soap, one 
ounce of boiling water, and three ounces of hot olive-oil, 
dissolved together; half an ounce of camphor dissolved 
in the olive -oil; when the above ingredients are well 
amalgamated, add one quarter ounce of oil of origanum ; 
half an ounce of spirits of ammonia; thrice the quantity 
of spirits of wine. Stir until nearly cold, then keep well 
corked in wide jars. 

Camphorated Oil, — Best oil of Lucca ; gum camphor. 

Pound some gum camphor, and fill a wide-necked pint

until the camphor is absorbed. Excellent lotion for sore 
chest, sore throat, aching limbs, etc. 

Lotion for Burns, — One pint of linseed oil ; one pint 
of lime water. Mix and shake well. 

Lotion for Scalds, — Equal parts of prepared lard and 
spermaceti cerate ; blend for an ointment. This ointment 
is equally good for burns. 

For Cold, — There is no remedy so good as to go to bed 
and stay there, drinJcin^ nothing^ not even water, for 
twenty-four hours, and eating as little as possible. Or, go 
to bed; put your feet in hot mustard and water; put a 
bran or oatmeal poultice on the chest ; take ten grains of 
Dover's powder, and an hour afterwards a pint of hot 
gruel ; in the morning rub the body all over with a coarse 
towel, and take a dose of aperient medicine. 

Violet, pennyroyal, or boneset tea are excellent to pro- 
mote perspiration in case of sudden chill. 

Or, take white wine whey. One pint of milk; two

in powder, two grains; opium in powder, two grains; 
gum-arabic, in powder, a suflScient quantity. 

Make into a mass, with a few drops of water, and divide 
the mass into twenty-four pills. The dose is two pills, 
taken on the day after the chill, morning, noon, and night 
before each meal; if the chill returns on the seventh, 
fourteenth, or twenty-first day, take the dose after three 
days ; if they return the first week, the pills can be takeji ; 
but the chills will not be likely to show themselves again. 

Liniment for Chilblains^ No. 1. — Spirits of turpentine, 
three drachms ; camphorated oil, nine drachms. 

Mix for a liniment. For an adult four drachms of the 
former, and eight of the latter may be used. If the child 
be young, or if the skin be tender, the camphorated oil 
may be used without the turpentine. 

Liniment for Chilblains^ No. 2. — Spirits of turpentine, 
white wine, contents of an egg in equal proportions; bot- 
tle, and shake until thoroughly amalgamated. 

F(yr Broken Chilblains. — Spread a little spermaceti ce- 
rate on lint or old linen, and apply morning and night 
to the part affected. 

For Chapped Skin. — Keep a muslin bag filled with 
bran constantly soaking in the water which you use for 
your ablutions ; the bran should be changed twice a week ; 
immediately after bathing rub the chapped skin with deer 
suet, or with glycerine and rose-water, in the proportion 6f 
three parts of glycerine to one of rose-water; do this 
while the skin is still wet. 

Earache. — There are various ways of treating earache : 
the most old fashioned are the appliance of a roasted 



612 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

onioD, or a hot bag of salt to the ear, and putting in the 
ear a small piece of cotton wet with camphorated oil, or 
simple olive-oil with a drop of chloroform ; better still, to 
puff tobacco smoke into the ear. This remedy is very 
soothing and effective. 

Or, take a small wax taper, pare one end quite small, 
envelop it in a dry linen rag, insert it into the ear ; then 
light the taper; Odd as this remedy may seem, it is won- 
derfully rapid and effective ; it is practised by all Italian 
sailors and fishermen. 

In Kentucky, a cockroach is drowned in whiskey, then 
wrapped in hot cotton, and applied to the ear. 

ExceUe/mt Enema for Constipation. — Two tablespoonf uls 
of table salt, two tablespoonf uls of olive-oil, and one pint 
of thin gruel.

HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 513 

spoonfuls for a dose. For a child five years old a table- 
spoonful. The state of the bowels must be attended to, 
and the doses repeated accordingly. No other medicine 
to be taken, except an emetic, at first, if desirable. Except 
in the case of an infant, a milk diet to be avoided. 

For WormSj No. !U — One ounce of quassia wood ; one 
quart of boiling water. 

Infuse, strain, and bottle; give a tablespoonful three 
times a day to a child four years old ; the quantity may 
be increased or diminished in proportion to the age of the 
child. 

For Worms^ No. 2. — Half an ounce of pink root ; quar- 
ter of an ounce of senna ; quarter of an ounce of fennel ; 
one pint of boiling water.

Injection for Pin WormSj No. 1. — Two ounces of 
quassia wood ; one quart of boiling water. 

Injection for Pin Worms^ No. 2. — Lump of lime the 
size of an egg ; one quart of water. . 

External Applications. 
Hot Salt, — Put a pint of powdered salt (the coarse 
cooking salt is the best for this purpose) into the frying- 
pan, or into the oven ; when the salt is very hot pour 
instantly into a flannel bag, and when suffering with pain 
apply to the stomach. 

Hot Flannel^ Wet. — Take a yard of flannel, fold it in 
three widths; then dip it in very hot water; wring it 
tolerably dry, and apply it evenly and neatly round and 
round the bowels ; over this put a flannel bandage four 
yards long, and four inches wide. 

22* 



«14 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

ColdrW(der Bandage, — Take a yard of flannel, fold it in 
three widths ; then dip it in cold water; wring it tolerably 
dry ; apply evenly and neatly round the bowels ; over this 
put an oiled silk bandage, suflSciently long and wide to 
completely swathe the bowels, and over that again put 
tlie double flannel bandage as above. 

Alcohol Bandage for Sore Throat — Take a strip of 
flannel sufficiently long to go three times round the throat ; 
heat it, dip it in alcohol, and, when thoroughly soaked, 
fold it, and apply it to the throat ; pnt over this a strip 
of oiled silk, and over that tie an old silk or linen hand- 
kerchief ; this is a safe, easy, and soothing remedy for 
a sore throat. The bandage should be moistened from 
time to time with alcohol as it dries. 

Red-Pepper Bandage. — Prepare as above, but dust the 
bandage lightly with red pepper before applying it to the 
throat ; it will prove an admirable counter-irritant. 

Barm-and'Oaimeal Poultice for Sore Throat — Pnt 
half a teacupful of barm into a sancepan, and put it gn 
the fire to boil ; as soon as it boils take it off the fire, 
and stir oatmeal into it until it is of the consistency of a 
soft poultice ; then place it on a rag, and apply it to the 
, throat; carefully fasten it on with a bandage, two or three 
turns of the bandage going round the throat, and two or 
three over the crown of the head, so as to apply the poul- 
tice where it is wanted, that is to say, over the tonsils ; tack 
the bandage, do not pin it. In scarlet fever the poultice 
should be changed three times a day. 

Bread -and 'Milk Poultice (Dr. Abernethy). — Scald a 
basin, for you can never make a good poultice unless you 
have perfectly boiling water; then, having put in' some 
boiling water, throw in some coarsely crumbled bread, and 
cover it with a plate ; when the bread has soaked up as 



HOUSEHOLD, TOILET, AND MEDICAL RECEIPTS. 615 

much water as it will hold, drain ofi the remaining wa- 
ter, and there will be left a light pulp ; spread it a third 
of an inch thick on folded linen, and apply when of the 
temperature of a warm bath ; it may be said that this 
poultice will be very inconvenient if there is no lard in it, 
for it will soon get dry ; but this is the very thing you 
want, and it can be easily moistened by dropping warm 
water on it, while a greasy poultice will be moist, but not 
wet. 

Bran Poultice. — Stir bran into a vessel containing 
either a pint or a quart (according to the size of the poul- 
tice required) of boiling water, until it be of the consist- 
ency of a soft poultice ; then put it into a flannel bag, 
and apply it to the part affected ; when cool, dip it from 
time to time in hot water. 

Linseed Poultice, — Stir linseed into a vessel containing 
either a pint or a quart of boiling water, and continue 
stirring steadily, but slowly, until it comes to a boil; then 
take the vessel instantly from the fire ; spread the poul- 
tice half an inch thick on folded linen, and apply when 
the temperature is of blood heat ; this is an excellent poul- 
tice. In cases of inflammation of the bowels it may be 
improved by the addition of two tablespoonf uls of mustard 
powder and a tablespoonf ul of olive-oil ; the latter in- • 
gredient prevents it from drying too soon. 

Flaxseed Poultice — Is made as above, omitting the 
mustard and olive-oil. 

Teast Poultice (Dr. Abernethy). — One pound of flour ; 
one ounce of yeast. 

Mix with very hot water; keep stirring until beaten 
together, and spread on soft linen or cotton. 

Linseed-Meal Poultice, — Scald the basin in which you 



616 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

make the poultice, and then throw in a little finely ground 
linseed ; pour a little hot water on it, and stir carefully 
until the mixture is quite smooth; proceed in this way 
until you have a sufficient quantity, then spread the poul- 
tice on a piece of soft linen ; it should be a quarter of 
an inch thick, and so wide that it will cover the inflamed 
part; put a bit of hog's lard in the centre of it, and when 
it begins to melt draw the edge of the knife over, and 
grease the surface of the poultice; when made in this 
way it is smooth and soft. 

Alum Poultice. — Beat up the whites of two eggs with 
one drachm of alum ; afterwards drain it off from the un- 
mixed portion of alum ; put it between muslin, and apply 
it to sore eyes. 

Hemlock Poultice. — Two drachms of dried hemlock; 
two pints of water boiled down to one ; add sufficient lin- 
seed meal to make it of a proper consistency. Excellent 
for cancerous and scrofulous ulcers, and malignant sores. 

Mustard Poultice. — Equal parts of flour of mustard 
and wheaten flour mixed with warm, not boiling, water. 

Mutton- Suet Poultice. — Equal parts of rolled bread 
.crumbs and finely chopped mutton suet. 

Put them in a saucepan with boiling water, and keep 
stirring over the fire until quite smooth ; this is a very 
good soft poultice.

vinegar ; cover it, and let it stand until the next day ; then 
strain, and cork it tightly. 

Caramel for Sauces. — Take some fine dry sugar and 
put it into a stewpan, without a drop of water ; put it on 
the fire and stir continually until it has assumed a fine 
brown color; then take it from the fire, and pour on 
enough water to liquefy it ; put the caramel thus prepared 
into a porcelain jar, which should be tightly closed ; it can 
be used to color any brown sauce or soup. 

Caramel with Bordeaux Wine for Sauces and Soups, — 
Prepare some sugar as above, and, before putting it on 
the fire, put in another stewpan a bottle of Bordeaux wine 
with the peel of a lemon ; the Bordeaux wine should heat 
d hain-mdrie while the sugar is browning; when the sugar 
is browned pour over it the wine instead of water ; stir

524 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Essence of Spinach (for sances). — ^Wash the spinach 
thoroughly through several waters ; then cook it in a very 
little water, with some parsley and a few onion tops ; when 
cooked, throw it instantly into very cold water, allow it to 
i*emain a few moments, and then put it into a clean, coarse 
muslin cloth, and press out the juice ; the juice will be of 
a beautiful green color, and can be used for coloring ^t^re^ 
of pease, pistachio cream, or any green sauce ; if yon wish 
to preserve it, it should be cooked d hain-marie^ and 
strained through a sieve ; the green deposit which remains 
in the sieve should be dried, put into a jar with a closely 
fitting lid, and kept in a cool place ; it will regain color 
the moment it is put into broth or sauce.

gathered it should be waslied in cold water, and instantly 
dried with a clean cloth ; it should then be placed on a 
gridiron, and roasted before — not over — the fire, which 
should be clear and fierce, so that the pareley may dry as 
quickly as possible ; it will soon curl up, and dry, but will 



BOTTLED SAUCES, CATSUPS, VINEGARS, ETC. 525 

retain its fresh, green color ; it can then be crumbled fine 
with the fingers, and put into a jar ; it is extremely useful

blerf nl of water for an hour, nntil the gelatinous substance 
is quite soft ; strain the liquor, and add half a teacnpf ul 
of rich pork or veal gravy ; stir all together, and keep 
lukewarm until the meat is ready for the mould ; but first 
pour in a little gravy to cover and jelly in the bottom of 
the mould, while you are cutting up the meat, which will 
make it turn out with a nice jelly on top; cut intosmall,neat 
pieces half a pound of any kind of cooked or tinned meat, 
or tongue; if bacon or a little fat pork is liked, boil a little 
with the ox foot, and cut it up with the other meat; season

tine has been dissolved to make it jelly, when cold, with 
a teaspoonf nl of made mustard ; butter some teacups, and, 
after placing at the bottom of each a tiny red star of beet 
root, pour in the mixture ; if a dozen scrambles are made, 
half of them can be garnished in this way, and half with 
stars made out of the white of egg boiled. In this man- 
ner can be made quite a novel and piquant dish for lunch- 
eon.

jellied stock, and heat it over the fire until the mixture 
is on the point of boiling; next remove the stewpan to

shapes ; mince together finely two pounds of chicken, half 
a pound of cooked ham, and half a pound of boiled tongue ; 
season and press this firmly into a compact lump, and put 
it into the mould in such a manner that it leaves an inch 
of space round every side, this space being filled with the 
gravy, which should not be poured in until quite cool, so

MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 

Souffle of GhestmUs. — ^Koast three dozen large Spanish 
chestnuts ; peel them carefully, and pound in a mortar ; 
pass the pxi/rie thus obtained through a sieve ; then return 
to the mortar with one half its weight of sugar, and, with 
the white of an ^^g^ work to a smooth paste, and then 
mould into little balls the size of a large Spanish chestnut; 
roll each ball in beaten white of egg; drain for a few 
minutes on a sieve; then roll in crystallized sugar; let 
them stand ten minutes ; then roll again in white of egg 
and crystallized sugar ; arrange on buttered paper, at some 
distance from each other ; cook in a slow oven twenty-five 
minutes ; when cold, arrange in a pyramid on a folded 
napkin. 

Hickory 'Nut BalU. — Crack a sufficient quantity of 
good hickory nuts ; pick out the meat, and dry in the 
oven ; then pound in a mortar, and proceed as above. You 
may substitute brown sugar for the white in preparing the 
hickory-nut balls, if you clioose. 

Aniseed BaUa, — The yolks of five eggs; sifted sugar 
and sifted flour, enough to work to a paste ; a pinch of 
aniseed. 

Beat first the sugar and then the flour to a paste ; add 
the flavoring, and drop by spoonfuls on buttered paper ; 
then put into a buttered mould and bake. 

Baked Apples^ No. 1. — Wash, and wipe dry, five firm 
apples, and cut out the blossom ends ; pack them in a large 



556 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

pnddingdish ; poor a cupful of water over them, cover 
the dish closely, set in a moderate oven, and steam until 
they are tender, and crack open ; then put into a cold dish, 
and pour over them the juice left in the baking-dish ; serve 
cold, with powdered sugar and cream. 

Baked Applea^ No. 2. — Pare very carefully and thinly, 
core, and fill the hollow of the core with loaf sugar; dust 
the apples with powdered sugar and cinnamon, and bake. 

Siberian Crab Clieese. — Wipe the fruit with a clean, dry 
cloth, and cut out all damaged parts with a silver knife ; 
put them in a covered jar in a slow oven until tender; then 
squeeze through coarse canvas ; weigh the pulp, and allow 
three quarters of a pound of lump sugar to every pound 
of pulp ; reboil for half an hour, skimming well ; put into 
moulds, and, when cold, cover with brandied paper. 

Apple Cahe. — Half a pound of apples, peeled, cut, and 
cored ; one pound of loaf sugar ; juice of three lemons, 
and half the rinds grated.

mould, and eat cold. A larger quantity can be made, and 
packed in jars, if desired; cover with brandied tissue 
paper, and again with white paper, and keep in a cool 
place ; it will be hard, like the crab cheese in consistency, 
and is very good. 

Coddled Apples, — Take large tart apples, wash, rub dry, 
peel thinly and delicately, and core them ; throw the peel 
into boiling water ; put into a porcelain-lined stewpan the 
weight of the apples in the best loaf sugar, and then strain 
the water in which the peel has been thrown, and pour 
over the loaf sugar enough of this wcUer to barely float 
the apples ; put the stewpan on the fire, and boil the sugar 
down to a clear syrup ; then put in the apples ; the stew- 
pan should be sufficiently large to prevent the apples from 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 557 

touching each other ; pnt in with the apples the rind of a 
lai'ge lemon prepared in the following manner: Peel the 
lemon thinly and delicately, taking care to* preserve the 
peel unbroken ; then, with a pair of sharp scissors, cut the 
peel into long, very thin strings, taking care, as before, to 
keep the length unbroken; put this into the saucepan 
simultaneously with the apples, and cook until tender; eat 
cold. This is the best way of cooking apples. 

Conde of Apples^ Pears^ Apricots^ etc. — Boil some rice 
in milk ; add, when cooked, a little fresh butter, vanilla, 
or other flavoring, and powdered sugar to taste; also, yolk 
of Qgg in sufficient quantity to color the rice yellow;

dish, put a pyramid of apples, pears, or other stewed fruit 
in the middle, cover the ring of rice with apricot marma- 
lade, and serve. 

Apples with Butter {Ouidniire Bourgeoiae). — Take 
large, firm, tart apples, peel and core them carefully, cut 
them in half; butter a large, wide pie^dish, and arrange in 
it small squares or rounds of white bread (stale) about half 
an inch thick ; each round or square should be exactly the 
size of one of the apple halves; when the mosaic of bread 
is neatly fitted to the dish, arrange the halved apples on 
the bread; fill the hollow of each apple with powdered 
sugar, and place on the sugar a small piece of very fresh 
butter ; cook in a very slow oven ; watch the apples care- 
fully, and as fast as the sugar and butter are absorbed re- 
new them until the apples are tender, and well cooked ; 
serve hot in the same dish. 

Apples with Mice {'Guisini^re Bourgeoise). — Butter a 
wide pie-dish, and place on it a layer, about an inch thick, 
of cold, boiled rice, in which you have beaten up two table- 
spoonfuls of apple jelly; arrange on this bed of rice a close 
layer of peeled, cored, halved, and half-stewed apples ; put 



558 THE UNRiyALLED OOOK-BOOK. 

into a slow oven, and, when the apples are qnite cooked, 
fill the hollow of each with apricot or other marmalade ; 
serve hot. 

Apples with Meringue. — Make a pyramid of coddled 
apples in the middle of a dish, cover it with a m&ringvs 
made by beating np, very stiff, the whites of two eggs with 
two spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a little zest of 
lemon ; cover the pyramid carefully and completely with 
meringue; dust the meringue with powdered crystallized 
sugar ; put into a gentle oven to brown, and serve as soon 
as lightly browned. 

Apples tlximbautes (Cuismiire Normande\ — Peel and 
core some firm, small apples, and stew with loaf sugar, a 
little lemon peel, arid water enough to keep them from 
burning; when tender, but still firm, take them cafe fully 
out of the saucepan, and arrange them in a pyramid on 
a large pie-dish ; boil down the syrup in the saucepan un- 
til it is very thick ; pour it over the apples ; dust the whole 
pyramid thickly with powdered sugar, and pour rum over 
all; just before setting the dish on the table set fire to the 
rum ; serve blazing. This is an old Norman dish, and is 
very good. 

Compote of Apples or Pears^ with Butter. — Peel, core, 
and halve the fruit, and put into a saucepan with enough 
water to keep it from burning; loaf sugar to taste; a stick 
of cinnamon, and a piece of fresh butter the size of a 
large egg; cook on a slow fire until tender. 

OroHtes of Peaches. — Butter a large, shallow pie-dish, 
and Cover it completely with slices of stale white bread 
fitted closely together, place upon these large ripe peaches 
cut in half, and stoned ; fill the hollow left by each stone 
with powdered sugar, and a piece of very fresh butter ; 
then cook in a very slow oven, watching carefully, and 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 659 

renewing the sugar as it is absorbed ; serve hot in the dish 
in which the peaches have been cooked. 

Croutes of Plums, — Proceed precisely as above. 

Croiitea of Apricots. — Proceed as above. 

Macedoine of Fruit — Have ready two dome-shaped 
fluted moulds ; one must be smaller than the other, so as 
to leave a vacancy of three inches between the inner and 
outer mould ; the inner mould must also be furnished with 
clamps at the edges, which will hold it firmly in position ; 
place the larger mould on cU least eighteen pounds of 
cracked ice ; then carefully hook the other mould in place 
and pour into the larger mould enough clear, transparent 
jelly to fill the vacancy between the two moulds ; the jelly, 
of course, may be of any color you prefer ; as soon as it is 
quite hard and firm fill the inner mould three quarters full 
of warm water ; this will enable you to detach it instantly 
and easily from the surrounding jelly ; have ready, well- 
picked and cleaned, from twenty to twenty-four fine 
strawberries, as many more very large strawberries, an 
equal quantity of white raspberries, and of white and red 
currants (strung) ; place in the dome of the jelly a layer 
of white currants ; surround and place on these giant 
strawberries ; then a layer of white raspberries ; then pour 
on some melted jelly ; as soon as the jelly hardens proceed 
to put in layers of fruit as before, alternating the colors 
and quality of the fruit ; finish with a wreath of the giant 
raspberries, surrounding a mosaic of red and white straw- 
berries ; pour in as much clear jelly as the mould will hold; 
put on a tightly fitting cover; pile up the ice, and leave 
the mould ; when the jelly is hard and firm plunge the 
form for a moment in boiling water, and turn out the 
macedoine on a cold plate ; it is the prettiest possible des- 
sert, and easily made, although the directions are neces- 
sarily prolix ; it may be varied at discretion, and may be 
made in winter with preserved fruits.

When the eggs are beaten, beat the sugar into the yolks ; 
then add the zest of lemon, then beat in the whites very 
lightly ; pour at once into a deep earthen dish, well but- 
tered ; dust lightly with powdered sugar, and bake in a 
quick oven ; seven or eight minutes should sufiSce ; serve 
in the same dish. 

Omelette SouffiS, No. 2. — The yolks and whites of six 
eggs, beaten separately to the utmost ; six tablespoonf uls 
of finely powdered sugar ; a little peel, grated from the 
surface of a fresh lemon ; a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter. 

Beat the yolks and whites separately until they are a 
very stiff froth ; tlien beat them together, then beat in the 
sugar and lemon ,• melt the butter in a pan, pour in the 
beaten eggs, and stir them until they have absorbed all 
the butter ; then pour into a buttered dish and bake ; serve 
as soon as browned. Omelette souffle should be taken di- 
rectly from the oven to the table in the dish in which it 
was baked. 

nice Panada. — Half a pound of rice ; a quarter of a 
pound of suet; one tablespoonful of salt; one table- 
spoonful of sugar; half a pound of the finest white 
flour, sifted; one quart of water; one gill of molas- 
ses. 

Boil the rice, suet, and sugar fast in boiling water for 
fifteen minutes ; then mix well together the flour, water, 



568 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

and molasses ; stir into the boiling rice, and cook five min- 
utes. 

Stuffed Peaches. — Take large ripe peaches, cut them in 
half, take out the stones, crack them, and pound the ker- 
nels in a mortar, and mix pmoothly with a little bread 
crumb soaked in rich cream, a pinch of powdered cinna- 
mon, and sugar to taste ; place all the peaches on a large, 
shallow, earthenware dish, and fill the cavity left by the 
stone with the above-named mixture, heaping it well up ; 
in the small spaces between the peaches place bits of fresh 
butter, pouring in, also, a little white wine ; shake finely 
sifted powdered sugar thickly and evenly over all ; finally 
cover with a light, even layer of finely grated and browned 
bread crumbs ; then place the dish in the oven, and let 
it remain until the peaches begin to assume a light-red 
color. 

Stuffed Apricots. — Choose large, fine, ripe apricots, and 
treat in precisely the same way, adding a few bitter al- 
monds to the stuffing. 

Staffed Apples. — Peel and core large tart apples, and 
stuff them with a mixture of bread crumb soaked in cream, 
blanched and pounded apple seeds, a pinch of cinnamon, 
and the same of nutmeg and a larger quantity of sugar 
than you would use for peaches or apricots ; stick some 
cloves in the apples, and arrange the apples in a deep 
earthenware dish, placing lumps of the best quality of loaf 
sugar between the different apples, and pouring a very 
little cold water into the bottom of the dish ; bake in a 
slow oven. These apples should be eaten cold, with a lit- 
tle cream flavored with lemon juice ; they will be found 
delicious. 

Stuffed Pears — Are treated in the same way, using less 
sugar, and putting a tiny pinch of cochineal in the baking- 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 569 

dish in order to give the pears a fine red color. They 
are very good. 

Fried -Plums. — Take large, firm plums, not too ripe ; 
wipe and set in a slow oven for half an hour ; then cut 
in half, stone, peel, and soak in liqueur^ rum, or brandy 
for two or three hours; then drain, roll in beaten ^^g^ 
dust with flour, and fry quickly ; they should be dusted 
thickly with powdered sugar before serving. 

Baked Pears. — Proceed as for "Baked Apples, No. 1." 
Or, if the pears are large, cut in half, put in a deep 
dish with a very little water, and sprinkle them with sug- 
ar and a pinch of ginger, cinnamon, or cloves; cover close- 
ly, and bake until tender. 

Baked Qumces. — Pare, quarter, and seed the quinces ; 
then stew them in clear water until a straw will pierce 
them ; put into a baking-dish with half a cupful of loaf 
sugar to every eight quinces ; pour over them the liquor 
in which they were boiled, cover closely, and bake in the 
oven one hour; then take out the quinces and put them 
into a covered dish ; return the syrup to the saucepan and 
boil twenty minutes ; then pour over the quinces, and set 
them away to cool. ^ 

Stewed Apples. — Select fine juicy apples, peel, and core ; 
put into a saucepan with just enough water to cover them, 
cover the saucepan closely, and stew the apples until they 
are tender and clear ; then take them out, put them into 
a deep dish, and cover them; add to the juice in the 
saucepan a cupful of loaf sugar for every twelve apples, 
and boil it half an hour, adding to the syrup a pinch of 
mace and a dozen whole cloves just ten minutes before 
taking it from the fire; pour scalding hot over the ap- 
ples, and set them in a cold place; eat ice cold with 
cream. 



670 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Stewed Pears. — One quart of small ripe pears, washed 
and wiped dry, but not 'pared or cored ; half a cupful of 
loaf sugar. 

Put the pears into a saucepan with just enough water 
to cover them, and stew until tender; then add the sugar 
and stew all together ten minutes ; take out the pears, lay 
in a covered bowl to keep warm, add to the syrup a little 
ginger and a clove or two, boil fifteen minutes longer, and 
pour over the fruit hot. 

Italian Stewed Pears. — One quart of small pears, peeled, 
but not cored ; half a cupful of loaf sugar. 

Proceed as above ; but as soon as the sugar is dissolved 
add enough cochineal to color the pears and syrup a bright 
red ; and, when the pears are dished, stew in the syrup a 
little candied orange and lemon peel. 

Pears Stewed Brown. — One quart of hard, tough pears, 
peeled and with the blossom ends cut out ; one cupful of 
molasses, best quality ; a pinch of ginger. 

Stew as above until very tender; then disli, cover, and 
add to the liquor in the saucepan an equal quantity of 
molasses and a little ginger; boil half an hour, skim, 
and return the pears to the saucepan ; stew all together 
twenty minutes. Tliis is really the best way of stewing 
pears. 

SouffA au Riz. — The yolks of four eggs ; six teaspoon- 
f uls of boiled rice ; one piece of very fresh butter the size 
of an egg ; lightly grated rind of a fresh lemon ; half a 
quart of milk. 

Stir all well together, put on the fire, and stir with a 
wooden spoon until the mixture has boiled up once or 
twice ; then remove from the fire, and when cool beat in 
the yolks of four eggs (already well beaten) and the whites 
of six, previously beaten to a stiff froth ; add powdered 
sugar and lemon juice to taste ; beat smoothly together, 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 671 

and, if too stiflE, add beaten white of egg until it is of the 
proper consistency ; pour into a bbttered mould, dust with 
powdered sugar, and bake in a quick oven ; twenty min- 
utes should suffice ; serve at once in the dish in which it 
was baked. 

Tdt Fait. — Mix the yolks of eggs with the finest white 
flour (sifted) until you have a stiff paste ; then reduce this 
paste to a light batter by adding a little fresh milk, and 
white of egg, well beaten ; add sugar to taste, and flavor 
with vanilla, zest of lemon, or orange-flower water ; when 
the tdt fait is soft, smooth, and light as a feather, pour on 
a buttered pie-dish, and bake instantly in a quick oven ; 
serve as soon as risen and browned. 

Tdt Fait with Fruit. — Proceed as above; but before 
sending the iAt fait to table, cover with a layer of del- 
icate preserve. This must be done quickly, lest the 
tdt fait should fall. Fresh fruit, sugared, may also be 
used. 

Souffle au CafL — The yolks of four eggs, well beaten ; 
six teaspoon fuls of potato flour; a piece of very fresh 
butter, the size of an egg ; zest of a lemon ; half a quart 
of milk, with coffee to taste. 

Mix the above ingredients smoothly together; then put 
on the fire, and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixt- 
ure boils up twice ; remove from the fire, and, when cool, 
add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and the stiffly beaten 
whites of six, with sugar to taste ; beat well together and 
pour into a buttered mould, cooking as for souffle au riz. 
This receipt may be varied at pleasure — for chocolate souffl^e 
or fruit. If properly made it is very good. 

Light Snow Dessert Busies^ or Darwpf-Nudeln, — One 
quart of the finest white flour, sifted ; enough yeast to 
make it rise; two tablespoonfuls of white sugar, pow- 



672 THE UNRIVALLED GOOE-BOOE. 

dered ; one tenth of a quart of rich cream ; a piece of 
butter the size of a turkey's egg ; the yolks of three eggs, 
well beaten ; a pinch of salt. 

Make into a very soft dough, cover, and let it rise ; when 
it has risen so that it is very light, dip out of the dough 
with a spoon pieces as large as an egg ; form them into 
balls with floured hands ; then put them on a baking-tin, 
strewn with flour, and let them rise still more ; meanwhile 
put into a saucepan just enough milk to cover the bottom, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, and a tablespoonf ul of 
powdered sugar; let it come to a boll, and put the nudeln 
in just half an hour before you eat them; do not put 
them too close together ; cover the saucepan closely, and 
put a cloth dipped in hot water round the lid, so that no 
steam can escape; let the nudehh boil slowly until you 
hear them crackle, which happens when the milk has 
evaporated, and the nudeln begin to brown ; then place 
the saucepan on one side of the stove, uncover it, and 
when the nudeln are nicely browned on the bottom take 
them out and place them on a round hot dish. Make a 
sauce of boiling cream or milk ; beat up in it the yolk 
of an egg, flavor with vanilla, and sweeten to taste ; serve 
in a sauce-boat. 

RIPE FRUIT FOB DESSERT. 

General Rules, — Berries ought always to be picked over 
very carefully, but should never be washed or sugared be- 
fore being served ; arrange on a bed of fresh leaves, and 
set in a cool place until wanted; serve powdered sugar 
and cream with berries of all kinds. 

Peaches^ Plu7n8^ Apricots^ etc, — Pick over carefully, and 
dust, if necessary; do not wipe, lest you remove the bloom, 
which is the chief beauty of all stone fruit ; arrange in 
pyramids interspersed with fresh leaves. 

Or, cover the fruit-dish with a bed of fresh leaves, and 
arrange the fruit in Parisian fashion, i. e,^ in a four-sided 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS. 573 

pyramid, the stem ends turned inward. Cherries are ex- 
tremely pretty arranged in this way. 

Apples^ Pears^ etc. — Wash, wipe dry, and rub to a bright 
polish with a cloth ; arrange in pyramids interspersed with 
green leaves. 

Oromge Salad. — Pare and slice in rounds fine ripe 
oranges; sprinkle with powdered sugar; then pile in a 
glass dish, and pour a couple of glassfuls of wine, or, 
better still, a tumblerful of orange and lemon juice, half 
and half, over all ; sprinkle again with sugar, and serve at 
once. 

Currants am»d ItaspberrieB. — String the currants, and 
pick both raspberries and currants over carefully ; mix in

nut thickly over it, sprinkle with sugar, and repeat this 
process until the dish is full. 

Ambroda^ No. 2. — Peel and "fig" the oranges; care- 
fully pick out all the pulp, rejecting the thin skin and 
seeds ; then proceed as above. 

Tutti-Frutti Fruit Salad. — Prepare some oranges as 
above, and arrange in a glass dish with an equal quantity 
of sliced bananas, and "pulled" (not sliced) pineapple, 
strawberries and raspberries if you have them, etc. ; sugar 
to taste; add wine or orange juice, and set on the ice for 
an hour before serving. 



674 THE UNBIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Crystallized Curra/nta. — Pick over carefully equal qaan- 
tities of white and red currants ; dip each bunch carefully 
in beaten white of egg and a little cold water (mixed) ; 
then roll in powdered crystallized sugar ; do this once or 
twice until the bunches are well frosted ; lay on white pa- 
per to dry ; then arrange in a dish for dessert. 



HOME-MADE CANDY.

one pouDd of white sugar ; wet with the milk of the nut ; 
let it boil slowly until thick, then pour it out on buttered 
plates. 

Peanut Candy. — Two quarts of peanuts, roasted in their 
shells, and then shelled and hulled ; two pounds of light- 
brown sugar. 

Boil the sugar in a preserving-kettle with enough water 
to wet it thoroughly, and form a syrup ; when the sugar 
begins to boil, throw in the white of an egg to clear it ; 
strain it, and try, by dropping a little of the sugar into 
cold water, if it is done enough ; if it hardens and be- 
comes brittle it is sufficiently boiled, and must be taken 
from the fire; the blanched nuts must then be stirred 
thoroughly through the sugar ; then wet with a brush a 
marble slab, free from all grease, and drop the hot mixt- 
ure upon it ; flatten into small oblong blocks ; when cold 
take them off the board with a knife. 

Almond Cand/y. — Two quarts of sweet almonds; two 
pounds of light-brown sugar. 

Blanch the almonds and roast them in the oven ; then 
proceed precisely as for peanut candy.

without stirring until it candies ; then proceed as for pea- 
nut candy. 

Maple-Sugar Caramels, — Two pounds of maple sugar ; 
one quart of rich milk. 

Break the maple sugar into small pieces, and put into 
a pan on the fire with the milk ; the pan must be deep 
enough to allow the sugar to expand as it boils ; stir with- 
out ceasing; test as usual in cold water, and when it is 
sufSciently brittle it is done ; then pour into square but- 
tered pans, and score with a knife into small tablets. 

Plain Caramds. — One pound of brown sugar ; a quar- 
ter of a pound of chocolate ; one pint of cream ; one large 
teaspoon ful of butter ; two tablespoonf uls of molasses.

brittle, then pour it into shallow flat pans that are well 
buttered. 

Cream Candy. — Three coffeecupfuls of the finest loaf 
sugar ; six tablespoonfuls of water. 

Boil without stirring in a bright tin pan until it will 
crisp in water like molasses candy ; just before it is done, 
flavor it with lemon, and add one teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar; then pour into buttered pans, and when fit to han- 
dle pull it perfectly white. 

JEverton Taffy. -^One pound of sugar; half a pint of 
molasses; half a pound of butter; grated rind of half a 
lemon ; boil all over a slow fire for an hour, and pour it 
upon tins well buttered. 

Ginger 'Drops. — Two ounces of candied orange peel 
beaten to a paste in a mortar, with a little sugar ; one 
ounce of powder of white ginger, mixed with one pound

25 



678 THE UNBIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

Oum-Drops {CuisinHre Parisienne). — Equal quantities 
of gum-arabic and orange-flower water ; dissolve the gum- 
arabic in the orange -flower water (cold process), then 
pour this mucilage on a wet marble table, and, with almost 
twice the quantity of powdered sugar and half the quan- 
tity of powdered gum-arabic, work it into little drops 
and tablets. 

Apple Sugar (Cuisiniire Baurgeoise). — To the syrup 
of tart apples, prepared as for apple jelly, add three times 
its weight of clarified sugar ; stir well, put on the fire 
and boil, stirring constantly ; as soon as it becomes brittle, 
drop on a wet marble slab ; when it becomes cool, cut into 
strips ; roll each strip in powdered sngar. 

Pdte a Bonbmis {Cuimii^re JBonrgeoise). — Blanch al- 
monds or any other nuts ; then pound in a mortar with 
loaf sugar (already pounded) until you have brought them 
all to a smooth, firm paste ; form into any shape you like. 
Tliis^^ is very good, and will keep for a fortnight. 

Pastilles {Cuisiniire BowrgeoisS). — Sift some fine pow- 
dered sugar through a very fine sieve; add to it just 
enough rose water to enable you to work it to a smooth, 
flexible paste; then put it into a pastille saucepan (or 
small preserving-kettle), place over a gentle fire, and stir 
steadily ; as soon as it begins to bubble, pour out on a 
wet or oiled marble ; pour through a tiny funnel, in little 
drops; or you may have tiny tin moulds placed on the 
marble, and pour in the pastilles ; with the above receipt 
you may make any variety of pastilles, fiavoring them to 
taste. 

Burnt Almonds or Pistachio Nuts {Cuisini^re Bour- 
geoise). — Blanch some almonds or pistachio nuts, and put 
them into a preserving-kettle with their full weight in 
loaf sugar, and half a glassful of water ; put on the fire. 



HOME-MADE CANDY. 579 

and, when it boils hard, remove from the lire and stir until 
the sugar granulates, and the almonds may easily be de- 
tached ; then take them ont, and put them aside ; divide 
the sugar into two portions : put half the sugar on the fire 
with half a tumblerful of water, and boil it until it almost 
caramels ; then throw in the almonds again, stir them until 
they have absorbed nearly all the sugaif* ; again take them 
out, put in the other half of the sugar, with half a glassful 
of water ; boil to a caramel, put in the almonds again, stir 
them until they have absorbed all the sugar ; then remove 
from the fire, and pour upon buttered plates ; pull apart 
the almonds which adhere. 



COOKERY FOR CAMPING-OUT. 

To Cook Crabs on the Shore. — When you reach the 
crabbing-shore, make ready your gypsy kettle, which is a 
large iron pot, swnng over a blazing fire, by suspending 
it from a tripod of strong poles ; fill it with water and let 
it boil while you catch the crabs ; plunge them alive in 
boiling water ; if they show signs of weakness, throw them 
away — they are not good ; let the crabs boil until they are 
bright red, then pour off the water, and break open the 
shells ; remove the fingers (which lie between the outer 
and inner shell), and remove also the sand-bags; all the* 
rest of the crab is good, especially the fat, which is usually 
of a reddish yellow, and found in the cavity of the shell ; 
break the crab in half, and you will find the meat revealed 
like the kernel of a well-cracked shell-bark. 

Crabs DedUed on the Shore. — Pick out all the bits of 
snowy and good meat in the crab, and pack into the red 
upper shell with bread crumb, butter, pepper, salt, and 
vinegar ; lay the shell on the red embers, and bake. 

Crab Stew on Shore. — One quart of crabs, carefully 
picked; half a gallon of boiling milk; a quarter of a 
pound of butter, in which a tablespoonful of flour has been 
rolled ; one tablespoonful of chopped parsley; one slice of 
onion ; one small red-pepper pod ; four peppercorns ; one 
teaspoonful of white sugar ; salt to taste. 

Put into your gypsy kettle and cook. 



COOKERY FOB CAMPING-OUT. 681 

Garae Broiled in Camp, — Sharpen at one end a piece 
of stick two feet long and an inch in diameter; pre- 
pare the meat by shaping it into thin pieces, run the 
stick through the pieces, and hold it over the fire; season 
them when half done with pepper and salt, and hold 
them over the fire until cooked ; be careful to use only 
coals. 

Smothered Qtml. — Bury the quail in hot ashes and 
embers ; let them remain thus fifteen minutes ; then take 
them out, and remove the skin with feathers attached ; 
open them, and the entrails will fall out ; season with 
pepper and salt, and a little butter. 

To Cook a Deer* 8 Head in Camp. — Dig a hole two feet 
square and one foot deep ; build a fire in it, and allow it 
to burn to embers ; remove about half of the remaining 
coals, throw in the hole a thin layer of green leaves, on top 
of which put the head in the same condition as when taken 
from the animal ; cover it thoroughly with a layer of green 
leaves, and the embers and ashes previously taken from 
the hole; allow the head to roast an hour and a half, then 
remove it and pull the skin from it ; season with salt and 
pepper. 

Potatoes amd Onions Eoasted in Camip. — EoU each 
onion and potato in a piece of wet brown paper, and cover 
them in hot ashes and coals ; allow three quarters of au 
hour for those of medium size. 

Opossums. — Opossums are best in the autumn, when 
the persimmons are ripe, as they eat that fruit and become 
very fat. They are never caught in the daytime. A fine 
moonlight night is the best time to catch opossums. When 
caught, put them in a cage, and feed them for several days ; 
skin and draw the opossum, cut off the legs to the first 
joint, and part of the tail ; stuff the head and body like a 



682 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

tnrkey, and roast it before a brisk fire ; opossums are never 
eaten hot. 

SporUmarCs Cake. — Take a smooth board; break off a 
strong, smooth sapling, and put it to use as a rolling-pin; 
then take one quart of white flour, four tablespoonf uls of 
butter, and one teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix it with the coldest water you can get, roll it out 
about one third of an inch thick ; then lay it on a smooth, 
flat stone, which has been thoroughly heated in the flre ; 
dust this stone with flour, and then bake your cake upon 
it ; or you may pour out the grease from the frying-pan in 
which the pork has been cooked, prop up the pan before 
the fire, and bake the cake like pone. 

Sportsman^ s Dodger. — Take some first-rate Indian meal ; 
pour enough boiling water over it to scald it; add salt 
to taste, and make up into little cakes ; brown them in 
the frying-pan, or bake them on hot stones, or on a board 
before the fire ; they are very good. 

Mmer^s Bread. — ^Two quarts of self-raising flour ; one 
teaspoonful of salt ; one quart of water. 

Mix all together until the batter is free from lumps ; 
then bake in a pan on the hot fire. 

Marylamd '^ Along Shore^^ Roast Oysters. — Select the 
largest and best oysters brought to shore, and wash them 
clean ; fill an iron pan with them, and set it on a bed of 
hot coals ; keep it there until the oysters open their shells; 
have ready another pan, smaller, fresh and clean, upon 
another bed of coals ; put into this other pan a good-sized 
piece of butter, a little salt and pepper, and some vinegar; 
then open the oysters with an oyster-knife ; drop them in 
the butter, and eat them steaming hot ; or eat them from 
the shells if you prefer. 



COOKERY FOR CAMPING-OUT. 583 

ClamSj AUmg Shore. — Make a fire on the beach of bnish, 
wreckwood, and sea-weed ; when yon have a glowing bed 
of embers rake out a place for the clams, and place the 
clams, edge downwards, ia the hot embers; sweet pota- 
toes in their skins, and Indian corn in its gauzy hnsks, 
may be interspersed among the clams ; then layers of sea- 
weed, . brash, and light wood of every sort are strewn 
thickly over all, and the fire may then be lighted ; after 
an hour or more the burning embera may be scattered, and 
the clams, potatoes, and corn eaten with butter, pepper, 
and salt. 

Clam-Bake on a Rocky Shore. — Some hours before yQu 
want to eat the clams build a large fire on the rock ; when 
the fire has burned out, clear the embers away quickly, 
and heap a quantity of clams on the hot stone ; throw on 
also some lobsters, crabs, and oysters, sweet potatoes, and 
ears of corn ; rake over the hot embers ; cover with a 
heavy mass of sea-weed, and let shell-fish, potatoes, and 
corn steam until all are done. 

Sportsman^ 8 Stew. — Two squiiTels well skinned and 
cleaned ; one small slice of fat bacon ; two quarts of 
tomatoes; six white potatoes, peeled and cut fine; two 
quarts of ochra ; one quart of Lima beans ; two large 
onions, cut up fine ; one pod of green pepper ; one table- 
spoonful of white sugar ; salt and pepper to taste. 

Pack the above in a hamper; light a fire; hang up your 
gypsy kettle, and as soon as you have shot, cleaned, and 
skinned the squirrels, put all the ingredients of your stew 
together in the kettle ; let them stew for four hours ; then 
add six ears of corn cut from the cob, and stew another 
hour; be very careful not to let it burn, and, if too thick, 
add a little boiling water. 

To Bake or Steam Trout — Scour the trout with sand, 
and wash them in running water ; open, and clean them ; 



684 THE UNBIVAIXED COOK-BOOK. 

then wipe dry, and pepper and salt inside, and envelop in 
strong white paper, carefully buttered ; wrap each tront 
up well ; then wrap again in six or seven folds of coarse 
straw paper ; dip each fish so encased into running water 
so as to saturate the straw paper; then lay the trout side 
by side in a bed of hot ashes and coals hollowed out for 
the purpose ; cover them thoroughly with the hot embers, 
and allow a minute an inch for cooking — ^that is, for a trout 
ten inches long allow ten minutes ; remove them from the 
ashes by inserting a long forked stick beneath, and draw- 
ing them out; unroll on a flat, hot stone; then open, 
butter, and eat ; there is really no better way of cooking 
trout. 

Angler^s Planked Trout, — Open, clean, salt and pep- 
per, and butter as above; then proceed to "plank" as for 
shad. 

Angler^s Fried Trout, — Take a large flat stone, wash 
clean, wipe dry, and lay on a glowing bed of embers; 
when red hot {i. e., as hot as a stone can be) lay on the 
stone a fish prepared for cooking as above, and fry thor- 
oughly ; eat with butter and salt. 

Angler^ 8 Boast Trout, — Scour, wash, open and clean 
the fish as usual; then cut off their heads, score them 
lightly, and pepper and salt them inside and out; cut one 
or more branches (sweet birch is best), and stick the fish

the back-bone ; hold the branch before the fire ; by watch- 
ing the inside of the fish it is easy to see when they are 
done.

find a slender, flexible branch of a tree (not pine or its 
congeners), fasten the fish by its head to the end of the 
branch, stick the other end into the ground, at an angle

that will allow the fish to hang in front of the fire where 
it will get the most heat ; put a small piece of pork on its 
head so that a little of the fat will run down the fish ; 
place a piece of hard tack under it to catch the drippings; 
keep it turning, so that both sides will cook alike ; when 
sufficiently done, eat it with the hard tack. This is a dish 
good enough for Izaak Walton.

DIRECTIONS FOR CLEANING SIL- 
VER, GLASS, CHINA, ETC. 

Louies Receipt for Cleaning Silver, — Dissolve a lump 
of carbonate of ammonia in a pan of absolutely boiling wa- 
ter ; pass the silver through it, and dry immediately ; once 
a week rub the spots with a little silver powder, L e.y fine 
whiting dissolved in spirits of wine ; when .this is quite 
well dried on the silver, rub each piece carefully with 
clean towels, atid then with soft chamois. It will be beau- 
' tifuUy bright. Still better than whiting is the jeweller's 
rouge, made in bars for the express purpose of cleaning 
silver. Wash the silver every time it is used, in a pan 
by itself, with plenty of boiling water, a brush, and silver 
soap ; dry each piece as it is taken out of the water, and 
rub with the chamois cloth before putting it away. Treat- 
ed in this way silver never becomes dim, and the weekly 
polishing is not a formidable affair. 

j Cleaning Pots^ KetUeSy and Tins. — ^Boil a double hand- 
ful of hay or grass in a new iron pot before attempting 
to cook in it; scrub out with soap and sand; then set 
it on the fire full of water and boil half an hour. 

New tins should stand near the fire with boiling water 
in them, in which has been dissolved a spoonful of soda, 
for an hour ; then be scoured inside with soft soap, after- 
wards rinsed with boiling water. 

Clean by rubbing with sifted wood ashes. 

Clean copper utensils with Bath brick, a little alcohol, 
and flannel. 

As soon as you empty a pot or pan, fill instantly with

hot water and set on the fire to scald them thoroughly. 
Always clean and wipe dry aU kitchen utensils before set- 
ting them away. 

/ To Polish LooTdng-glasses. — Wash clean with water in 
which a little soda has been dissolved, wipe dry, and pol- 
ish with a rag and a little bluing powder; finish with a 
chamois cloth, and rub hard and long. 

^ To Glean Knives, — Clean with soft flannel and Bath 
brick ; if rusty, use wood ashes rubbed on with a newly 
cut bit of Irish potato. Never allow the hot water to 
touch the ivory handles of the knives. 

To Wash China and Glass. — Have two large pans of 
hot water ; wash glass first, then silver, then china ; rinse 
off in one pan, transfer to the other pan of very hot wa- 
ter, and wash with a mop and strong soapsuds, and wipe 
instantlA/, Never allow glass, silver, or china to drain one 
instant. 

/ To Wash Windows. — Dissolve a little washing soda in 
the water, use a flannel cloth, dry quickly with a soft, 
clean towel, and poUsh with chamois-skin. 

I To Rvb Furniture. — If very dirty, wash off with a flan- 
nel cloth dipped in equal parts of vinegar and water ; dry 
instantly and thoroughly, and at once rub with flannel 
which has been dipped in linseed oil and carefully wrung 
out ; finish with dry flannel, and rub hard and long. El- 
bow grease counts for a good deal in keeping furniture 
bright. 

\ To (Ream, Carpets. — Sprinkle the carpet with tea-leaves, 
sweep well, then use soap and warm water for the grease 
and dirt spots; rub the wet spots dry with a clean cloth. 



MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. 

KITCHEN UTElfSILS, ETC. (" BOSTON COOK-BOOK "). 

Have a complete set of strainers, one of fine wire for 
sifting soda, spices, etc., and straining custards and jellies, 
others with meshes from one sixteenth to one eighth of an 
inch in diameter; also a sqnash-strainer and a colander. 
Extension wire-strainers are also convenient ; also a sup- 
ply of strainer-cloths made from coarse crash or cheese 
cloth, and fine napkin linen. A set of oval tin moulds, a 
melon mould, and one or two fancy moulds are convenient 
for entr^y puddings, and jellies. 

Among other useful articles may be mentioned : Dover 
egg-beaters, large and small; ordinary small wooden 
spoons and the large perforated ones; a whip chum; 
granite saucepans and stewpans holding from half a pipt 
to six quarts ; double boilers ; a wire basket for frying ; 
a potato slicer; a fine wire broiler for toast, and two 
coarser ones for steak and fish ; a set of pastry bags, and 
frosting-tubes; fancy vegetable cutters; a glass rolling- 
pin, and a small, sharp-pointed knife, made from the best 
steel, for paring potatoes, turnips, etc. ; also a set of tin 
measuring-cups holding half a pint, and divided into quar- 
ters and thirds. 

Small saucepans and bowls are more convenient than 
larger ones, and granite and agate ware are lighter to 
handle and more easily kept clean than iron - ware. 
Buckets are convenient for keeping sugar and small 



MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. 589 

qnantities of flour. Glass jars and wide-moatbed bottles 
are best for all groceries, grated bread, dried berbs, etc. 

I A refrigerator should be carefully examined daily, and 
kept perfectly clean ; a long, stiff wire, with a bit of cloth 
at the end, should be used to clean the drain-pipe; pour 
boiling washing-soda through it every other day, and 
always wash off the slime which adheres to the water- 
pan. 

Never wash a bread-board in an iron sink ; wash it in 
cold water, and scrub occasionally with sand soap ; scrape 
the dough off the board very carefully, holding the knife 
in a slanting position, and going with the gi'ain of the wood. 

A Dover egg-beater should never be put into water, 
but should be wiped clean with a damp cloth immediately 
after using, then wiped quite dry, and oiled with the finest 
olive-oil. 

I Scrape all dishes with a wooden knife before washing ; 
put bread and cake bowls, and all dishes in which flour 
and eggs have been used, into cold water until you are 
ready to wash them. 

1 Keep all soiled pans and kettles filled with cold water, 
and soak them until you are ready to clean them. 

[All pans should be first washed in clear, cold water, 
then in hot, soapy water, then rinsed in clear boiling 
water, and thoroughly dried with a dry, clean towel. 

* Iron-ware should be washed outside and inside in hot, 
soapy water, rinsed in clean hot water, and wiped dry with 
a dry towel. 

Dripping-pans, Scotch bowls, and other greasy dishes 



690 THE UNRIVALLED COOK-BOOK. 

should be scraped and wiped with soft paper, which will 
absorb the grease ; the paper will be found nsef nl in kin- 
dling. A tablespoonfnl of soda added to the hot dish- 
water will facilitate the cleaning. 

Kitchen mineral soap or pumice stone may be used 
freelj on all dishes, pans, and kettles ; it is very cleansing. 
Tins should be washed in clean, hot, soapy water, and 
rubbed frequently with mineral soap ; they will remain 
bright. 

j Saucepans, and other tin and granite dishes browned 
by use may be cleaned by letting them remain half an 
hour in boiling soda-water, then rubbing with a wire dish- 
cloth or stifi brush. 

A new tin coffee-pot should never be washed on the 
inside with soap ; wash outside, and rinse thoroughly in- 
side with clear water ; then set on the stove to dry, and, 
finally (when dry), rub the inside well with a clean, dry 
cloth ; keep a granite pan near the sink to use in washing 
vegetables. Always have in your sink an old quart tin- 
pan with holes in the bottom; pour everything that is 
turned into the sink through this strainer, and put the 
refuse into the swill-pail. 

Use a dish-mop for cups and dishes, and a strong linen 
cloth for everything that requires hard rubbing ; wash the 
sink thoroughly, flush the drain-pipe with hot suds or hot 
soda-water, wipe the sink dry and rub with a greased cloth ; 
always k^ep two swill -pails, and use them alternately, 
cleaning each as soon as emptied. 

Wash dish-towels in cold water, with plenty of soap, 
and rinse thoroughly in cold water every time they are 
used; if left to dry without washing they have a dis- 
agreeable odor, and are sticky. 



I 



MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. 691 

Every kitchen should be furnished with plenty of 
pieces of new white mosquito netting and cheese cloth 
for putting around fish, chickens, and vegetables which 
require careful boiling, also for bags for herbs and spices. 

Small squares of new cotton cloth are useful for wip- 
ing meat and fish ; keep them clean, and use for nothing 
else. 

(Keep a good supply of small holders, large coarse 
towels to use about the ovens, and fine crash towels for 
wiping dishes; keep a damp towel on the table, when 
cooking, for wiping the hands.
