Certain Rules. 

Certain rules for salad dressing are 
well to observe. 

First: Have suitable ingredients and 
condiments. 

Second: Mix carefully. 

Third: In regular order. 

Fourth : Serve most salads very cold. 

Fifth: Mix very quickly with silver, 
china, glass or wooden utensils. 

Sixth: Garnish with something that 
will afford a contrast and at the same time 
be suitable to eat. 

Seventh: In serving salads, serve rich 
salads for luncheon and supper. Serve light 
salads for dinner or for tea. 

In America we are apt to use may- 
onnaise dressing for everything, but in 
England and France, they serve French 
dressings with fish or fowl and most vege- 
tables. Cauliflower and tomatoes are nice 
with mayonnaise dressing. 

In the dressing no flavor should 
predominate. 

When a salad is served, no oil should 
ever remain at the bottom of the bowl. 






Cooked Dressing. 

No. i. 

Three eggs, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one tea- EGGS 
spoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of paprika MUSTARD

fuls of oil or melted butter, one cupful of milk, MILK 
one-half cupful of vinegar. 

Separate the eggs and beat the yolks 
until light. Add the seasonings to the 
vinegar and heat it to the boiling point. 
Scald the milk, pour it on to the beaten 
yolks and cook it with the vinegar in a 
double boiler until it begins to thicken, 
then add the oil and whites of the eggs, 
which have been beaten until stiff. 



Cooked Dressing. 

No. 2. 



One-fourth of a cupful of butter ', one-half 
teaspoonful of mustard, one saltspoonful of pap- 
rika, yolks of two eggs, one-fourth of a cupful CREA Q M R 
of vinegar, one-half pint of cream. 



Cream the butter, add the seasoning, 
the beaten yolks of the eggs, and the vin-

boiling water until very thick, stirring 
often. Whip the cream, and add it to 
the cold dressing just before serving.

Sauce Tartare. 

One-half pint mayonnaise dressing, three 
olives, one gherkin, one tablespoonful of capers, 
one teaspoonful of parsley, one onion if liked. 

Chop the olives, gherkin, capers, parsley 
and onion very fine, add them to the may- 
onnaise dressing, and it is ready for use.

French Dressing. 

One salt spoonful of salt, one-half salt spoonful 
pepper, three to five tablespoonfuls of oil, one 
tablespoonful of vinegar, one-fourth teaspoonful 
onion juice if liked. 

Put the salt and pepper in a bowl, dis- 
solve them with the vinegar, add the oil 
slowly and mix well. This dressing is 



suitable for egg or vegetable salads, and is 
also used to macerate meat or fish salad. 

Lemon juice may be used instead of 
vinegar, and the onion juice if liked. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. 

.One ieaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful 
of salt , one-fourth salt spoonful of c ayenne, yolks 
of two eggs, one pint of olive oil, two table- OLIVE CHL 
spoonfuls of vinegar, two table spoonfuls of lemon 
juice, one cup of whipped cream if liked. 

Mix the dry materials in a shallow dish 
or soup plate. Add the yolks of eggs. 
Stir well with a silver fork or wooden spoon. 
Add the oil a few drops at a time, stirring 
until it thickens. When the dressing is 
thick, thin it with a little lemon juice, then 
add oil and lemon juice alternately, and 
lastly the vinegar. The dressing liquefies 
as soon as mixed with the vegetables or 
meat; therefore it should be made stiff 
enough to keep its shape until used. One 
cup of whipped cream may be added before 
using if liked.
