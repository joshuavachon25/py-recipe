This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

"Mr Favorite Receipt. 



}} 



THIS unique cook hook Juzs been compiled from the contributions received from 
our lady patrons in response to the request contained in the ^^Boyal Baker and 
Pastry Cook^ that they would send us one or more of their favorite receipts for pub- 
hcation. The receipts are given in arrangement and language as contributed, so far 
cts practicable. The response from our patrons has been so generous that we were 
obliged, in arranging for publication, to condense as far as possible and to somewhat 
abbreviate many of the formulas in order to confine the volume within reasonable 
limits. Where it has been impossible to give dH the receipts contributed for making 
any particular thing the omissions have been made from those contributions containing 
a number of receipts, and in the selections in these cases preference has been given to 
those receipts first received. No charge has been made, however, in the essentials of 
the receipts given. It would be interesting, were it practicable, to give the comments 
accompanying the receipts. They are described as having been used for years ; as 
having been tested thoroughly, as never failing, etc. Being a compilation of for- 
mulas, all thus thoroughly tested, proved eooceUent, and vouched for by the most 
thorough housekeepers of the land, ^^ My Favorite Beceipt^ cannot prove otherwise 
than the most essentially practical and valuable cook book yet published. 

It is proper that we should say to those of our contributors who include cream 
of tartar and soda in their receipts, and who, doubtless, are unfamiliar with the use of 
baking powder, that in dH cases incomparably better results wiU be obtained by the 
use of the Boydl Baking Powder instead of cream of tartar and soda or sour milk. 
Cake, biscuit, roUs, muffins, and all pastry wUl be made more tight, palatable, and 
wholesome when raised by Boydl Baking Powder than by any other agency. Some 
receipts dlso include the use of alum. In no case should alum or an atum baking 
powder be used in the preparation of food, as it is poisonous. 

It has been a difficult task to satisfactorily classify the receipts. The names 
given to them by the contributors have been generally retained, and the classifi- 
cation made accordingly, so far as possible. Hence, receipts for the preparation 
of the same article may perhaps be fotmd under two or three different headings, 
because of the different names given to them by their respective contributors. The 
name and address of the contributor are given in all cases except where requests to 
omit have been made, and in those instances where the ladies have omitted to add them. 

It is rather marvelous and eocceedingly creditable to the ingenuity of our American 
housekeepers, that, in three thousand receipts for the prepa/ratUm of all kinds of 
cookery, there should be no two dUke, even for the preparation of the same article. 

The collection wiU be found remarkable in many ways, and exceedingly valuable 
for the large amount and wide scope of the information it contains. We feel assured 
that the contributors to it unU be gratified and benefited by the eoschange of experience 
and knowledge its publication chords.

Trout or Pickerel (a French receipt for Cooking- 
Fish).^ Cut the fish in pieces about 2 laches square, 
boil 6 or 6 minutes in white wine and water (1 part water,

Meats, JJeat Loaf, 3tews, gausage, etc, 



* A LA MODE.— 6 lbs. lower side of 

I round of beef; lard with fat pork cut in narrow, 
' thin strips, rolled in parsley, onions, and dry 
mushrooms, all chopped fine: salt and pepper; lay a 
slice of fat pork in the bottom of your pot, the beef upon 
it with a small onion in which you have studc 2 cloves, 
a small piece each of carrot and turnip (and, if liked, 
a piece of bay-leaf); 1 gill water; cover tight, cook 
very slowly from 6 to 6 hours ; when half done, turn it 
over, poiu: over the meat a wine-glass of brandy ; cover 
tight again until done; be careful not to let it bum; 
strain the gravy; serve hot Very fine cold. A very 
old French receipt — Mrs. A. E. Johnson, Craafoid, 
N.J. 

Boiled Flank of Beef.— Wash the flank, and 
make a dressing as for turkey, which spread over it, 
first having salted and peppered well ; then roll up and tie ; 
wind the twine around it several times to keep in place; 
then sew up in a cloth kept for that purpose ; put a small 
plate in the pot and put in the meat, then pour on it 
boiling water enough to cover, and boil gently 6 hours. 



When done, remove the cloth, but not €be twine until 
stone cold; then cut in thin slices, and you will have 
alternate layers of meat and dressing. This is a nice dish 
for breakfiuit or tea. — Mrs. Mary Hoff, Waukegan, 111. 

Oomed BeefL — Boil until soft enough to pull the 
bones out ; place in an earthen dish, and pour over it the 
water it was boiled in, after removing fat; place a plate 
on it and a heavy weight ; have sufficient water, so that 
when the weights are on, it will come to the top cS. the 
meat; let stand until cold, then cut in thin slices, and 
it is ready for the table. — Kate H. Fridley, Carlisle, Pa. 

Comed Bee£— Cook the beef in plenty of water, 
but the water should be boiling before the beef is put in ; 
then it holds all its juices, and is much nicer than put in 
cold water. I pour out some of the corned-beef water in 
another kettle for the turnips and cabbage, as I diink they 
spoil the taste of the meat; I cook nothing in with the 
meat but potatoes ; your corned meat is much nicer to let 
it cool a litde in the water before taking out — Annie H, 
Presbrey, Steep Brook, Mass.

corned beef, 2 lbs. fried pork chops, 1 chicken cut up and 
boiled in 3 pts. of water until two-thirds done ; take it out

of cassaripe, 8 green chillies or 4 red, 2 bay-leaves 
and a sprig of thyme tied together, 3 medium-sized 
onions previously fried and drained from fat Let it 
boil up, take off any scum that may rise ; rub together a

pour about 1 qt hot water into this, stirring the while; 
now pour off all the grease but about 2 tablespoons, and

pound them to a fine smooth paste, one at a time, in a 
very dean marble mortar, adding, as 3rou proceed, 
plenty of rose-water to prevent their oiling ; set in a cool 
place; beat 12 eggs till very smooth and thick, and then 
beat into them, gradually, 1 lb. powdered loaf-sugar, in 
turn with the pounded almonds ; lasdy, add the flour, 
stirring it around slowly and lighdy, on the surface of 
die mixture, as in common%ponge cake ; have ready a 
deep square pan, block tin, butter it nicely, put the 
mixture carefully into it, set it into the oven and bake 
it until thoroughly done and risen very high ; when cool, 
cover it with plain white icing, flavored with rose-water; 
wi& sweet almonds always use a small pordon of bitter 
ones; without them, my experience is, they havelitde or 
no taste, though they add to the richness of the cake.

Currant Jelly. — Wash currants, mash in a 
porcelain dish, squeeze through jelly-bag, rinse out bag^ 
run the juice through again without squeezing, then to 
every pt of juice add 1 lb. sugar; while boiling, skim 
off* scum and boil until stiff (20 minutes) ; an excelloit 
jelly is made by taking ^ currants, % red raspberries, 
and proceeding as above ; these, taldng % each, make 
a better preserve then either one alone. ^Afr^r. IV, F, 
Fascot, S. Easton, Pa. 

Cuzrant Jelly.— Jam the cturants and get the 
juice all out; boil the juice 6 minutes, the sugar being 
placed in the oven and heated very hot, then add sugar 
and boil 1 minute; 1 lb. sugar to 1 pt juite.— ^iS^nx 
Tildeut Covington, Pa. ^ 

Elderberry Jelly,— 1 qt elderberries, 1 pt 
water; boil together a few minutes, then press through a 
towel till all the jdce is extracted; 1 qt crab^ipplesand 



1 pt water boiled togedier, and juice extracted in same 
way ; the apples should be cut once or twice through be- 
fore boiling; now mix the juice of both together, and to 
1 pt juice take 1 lb. white sugar and boil about 10 or 16 
minutes till it will jelly nicely ; elderberry juice will not 
jelly when taken alone, but by adding the juice of apples 
it gives a beautifiil jelly.— ifrv. D. N, LeAman, Lan- 
caster, Pa. 

Qrape JeUy.— I prefer Coocoids, just tuning 
purple; place grapes in preserving-kettle with water to 
nearly cover them, stir often till they are all breaking 
open, then pour in jelly-bag and drain, but do not press 
thejuice out, weigh and return the juice to the fire, then 
weigh out as much sugar as there was of juice ; when the 
juice commences to boil, put in half the sugar, stir a litde, 
when this boils, strain through a dean cloth and return 
again to the fire ; now, when it again boils, add the re- 
mainder of the weighed sugar, stir gendy, and pour in 
glasses to cool for fiiture use. I make other fiiuit jellies 
the same way ; take the grapes fit>m the jelly-bag and 
press the pulp through a tin or fine sieve ; add as much 
sugar as you have of the pulp, and cook till done ; this 
makes a very good grape butter.— Mrs, Lima ColUnSi 
Chapman, Neb. 

Gooseberry JeUy.— Bruise a quantity of goose- 
berries and pass them through a sieve, and add ^ of 
their weight in loaf sugar; boil finiit with sugar to a jelly 
so thick that when dropped into a dish it will not adhere 
to it, then strain.- ^w Tillie Eurich, Prospect, O. 

Strawberry Jelly. — Squeeze the juice from 
fircihly gathered berries, for the slightest tendency to 
fermentation win spoil the whole process; let the juice 
drip, without squeezing, through a flsmnel bag; to each 
pt of this clear juice allow ^ lb. sugar; put this syrup 
over a briskly burning fire, and boil hard just 20 minutes ; 
stir as little as possible, and only at first, till the sugar is 
dissolved, and then always with a silver spoon; do not 
attempt to make more than 8 or 4 lbs. of jelly at once, 
and attention to every litde particular direction given is 
necessary to insure success. Jellying requires more pains 
than almost any other process of cookery; strawberry 
jdly, when well made, more nearly resembles guava 
jelly than any other that can be prepared from the fiiiits 
of the temperate zone.— C, Maggie Meldahl, Scott, W. 
Va. 

Tomato Jelly.— 1 pk. yellow tomatoes, cut in 
pieces and boU imtil soft, strain through a cloth ; to every 
cup of juice take 2 cups sugar; put the juice on and let 
boil 20 minutes with 1 lemon sliced ; then add heated 
sugar and let boil 15 minutes longer ; treat the same as 
other jellies.— JSff». Frank H, Weir, La Porte. 

Apple Marmalade.— Take sour apples, core but 
do not peel, put on the stove widi enough cold water to 
cover and boil ; when cooked soft, strain through a colan- 
der to separate firom the skins ; then take half as much 
sugar as strained apples, season with ground cloves and 
allspice, and boil until thick ; lay 2 slices of lemon in 
each jar before sealing. — Miss Ada Mate, Delaware, O. 

Cranberry Marmalade.— Wash and pick over 

the berries, and to every qt. of firuit add 1 pt water and 
cook 1 hour, stirring constanUy ; then remove fi?om fire, 
and to every qt of berries add 1 teaspoon soda; stir and 
skim off the green firoth that rises, then strain through a 
coarse sieve, and then to every cup of juice add 1 cup 
granulated sugar ; return to fire and cook % hour, then 
put in molds, and it is ready for use in 2A houxs.— il/rj.

which it is their object to defame will probably exhale a perceptible gas. Here 
again deception is practiced. The best baking powders have a leavening power 
beyond that developed by cold water, which is given off by the heat of baking. A 
baking powder, therefore, which will produce no additional gas when hot water is 
added is lacking in strength and otherwise inferior. Bread and biscuit that con- 
tinue to rise while baking are lighter, finer, and more digestible. 

These testers, unless carefully watched, will dexterously throw into the can of 
baking powder given them for trial, salt, soda, or powdered lime with intent to 
destroy it. Should there be no baking powder in the house, the operators will 
produce a sample of that generally used which has been previously " doctored " to 
make such exhibit as they desire. 

These adulterated, lime and alum powders are frequently left in samples at the 
door for the purpose of introducing them, with circulars containing bogus analyses 
and certificates^ and false representations as to their value. That fact alone is 
sufficient to condemn them. No manufacturer whose goods are of value can afibrd 
to give them away, and none but the cheapest, most inferior, and unmarketable 
goods require to be distributed free in order to get the public to use them. This 
method is adopted only by parties who have failed to dispose of their wares through 
the ordinary and legitimate channels of trade. Free samples of articles of food 
left at the house should be regarded with suspicion. There is no guarantee of 
their wholesomeness, while there is real danger that they contain a fatally poisonous 
compound. 

The only way to protect our food from being contaminated by the tramps, testers, 
and samplers is to turn all who wish or attempt to tamper with it unceremoniously 
from the door, to throw their goods away, and particularly to use no new, untried, 
and suspicious article. The Royal Baking Powder has been in use for twenty years ; 
its perfect purity and wholesomeness is guaranteed by hundreds of analyses and 
tests by Government chemists, Boards of Health, etc. Its merits have secured for it 
the constant patronage of the American people to an extent beyond the combined 
sale of all other baking powders. Careful housekeepers who desire pure and 
perfect food and regard the health of their families will use no other. 

ALL BULK BAKING POWDERS ARE UNSAFE. 

The public is cautioned against the practice of many grocers who sell what they 
claim to be Royal Baking Powder, loose or in bulk, without label or trade-mark. 
All such powders are base imitations. Analyses of hundreds of samples of baking 
powders spld in bulk to parties asking for Royal have shown them all to be largely 
adulterated, mostly with alum, dangerous for use in food, and comparatively 
valueless for leavening purposes. 

A favorite method of selling these poisonous alum baking powders is by placing 
them in an empty Royal Baking Powder can and weighing them out in small quan- 
tities when the Royal Baking Powder is called for by customers. 

The public is too well aware of the injurious effect of alum upon the system, to 
need further caution against the use of any baking powders known to be made from 
this drug; but the dealer's assurance, ** Oh, it'sjust as good as Royal," or **It*sthe 
genuine Royal, only we buy it by the barrel to save expense of can," etc., is apt to 
mislead unsuspecting consumers into buying an article which they would not 
knowingly use in their food under any consideration. 

The Royal Baking Powder is sold only in cans, securely closed with the Company's 
trade-mark label, and the weight of package stamped on each cover; It is never 
sold in bulk, by the barrel, or loose by weight or measure, and all such offered the 

GO 



public, under any pretense, are imitations. No baking powder safe for u^ in food is 
ever sold in bulk or by weight. 

If consumers will bear these facts in mind, and also see that the package purchased 
is properly labeled and the label unbroken, they will be always sure of using a 
baking powder perfectly pure and wholesome, and of the highest test strength in 
the market. 

POISONOUS ALUM BAKING POWDERS — BITTER BREAD. 

Alum powders are injurious to health, and should under no consideration be used. 
These powders will be found on sale under various names in almost every grocery 
store. They are distinguished generally by their lower price or by having a gift 
offered with them. Biscuits made from alum baking powders also have a bitter taste, 
and when broken are more tough than when made from a proper baking powder. 
Chemical analysis is the sure means of detecting them ; but when this cannot be 
had, the only safe way is to avoid all powders that are suspected of containing alum, 
all that are sold in bulk or by weight, or with presents, or below the price of a first- 
class article, and particularly all that leave a bitter taste in the food. 

It is not necessary to quote the numerous authorities as to the effects of alum 
baking powders upon the system. Their use has been condemned by physicians, 
chemists, and scientists generally as dangerous, and so well understood and feared 
is this danger by the public that none of their proprietors dare to sell them for what 
they are — alum goods. 

The effect which alum has when taken into the mouth, familiar to every one, is 
the effect produced by it upon the coats of the stomach and intestines. Alum is 
classed by the medical dictionaries, in ordinary doses as an astringent, in larger 
doses as a purgative, emetic, and poison. The symptoms that follow its continued 
use are indigestion, heartburn, headache, dyspepsia, inflammation of the stomach, 
liver, and kidneys, and finally those serious disorders of these organs which medical 
treatment cannot reach. 

The Royal is the only baking powder that contains neither lime nor alum, and 
perfect safety lies only in its exclusive use. 

PRIZE BAKING POWDERS ARE DANGEROUS. 

All baking powders sold with a gift or present, or with a ticket or scheme for 
giving the purchaser a present, should be avoided. Baking powder makers will not 
give away articles of value for nothing — they make up the cost of these gifts by 
selling an inferior, cheaply made powder. 

It has been found upon analysis that these gift and prize powders are hiade from 
alum or other cheap ingredients. Alum powders cost less than four cents a pound 
to produce ; the gift or prize costs but a few cents more. They are sold at the price 
of a first-class powder, or but little less, so that the swindle in a commercial sense 
is enormous. The danger to the health of the consumer is, however, the more 
important consideration. 

DO NOT USE SALERATUS 

And sour milk, or cream of tartar and soda. It is impossible to procure pure cream 
of tartar from the grocers, and its use will result in unwholesome cake and biscuits. 
In all receipts where cream of tartar and soda or saleratus are called for, substitute 
Royal Baking Powder and get better results. The usual proportions in the old way 
were two teaspoons of cream of tartar to one of soda or saleratus, instead of 
which use two teaspoons of Royal Baking Powder and mix with flour while dry. 
Never use sour milk with Royal Baking Powder.

REPORTS OF GOVERNMENT CHEMISTS 

On the Purity and Wholesomeness of Royal Baking Powder. 

I have tested a package of Royal Baking Powder, which I purchased in the open 
market, and find it composed of pure and wholesome ingredients. It is a cream of 
tartar powder of a high degree of merit, and does not contain either alum or phos- 
phates, or other injurious substances. 

E. G. Love, Ph. D., 
Chem. for U. S. Gov't. Late Analyst N. Y. State B'd of Health. 



It is a scientific fact that Royal Baking Powder is absolutely pure. I will go still 
further and state that, because of the facilities that company have for obtaining per- 
fectly pure cream of tartar, and for other reasons dependent upon the constituents 
used in its manufacture, the proper proportion of the same, and the method of its 
preparation, the Royal Baking Powder is undoubtedly the purest and most reliable 
baking powder offered to the public. 

Henry A. Mott, M. D., Ph. D., 

Late U. S. Government Chemist. 



I have examined the cream of tartar manufactured by the New York Tartar 
Company and used by the Royal Baking Powder Company in the manufacture of 
their baking powder, and find it to be perfectly pure, and free from lime in any form. 
All chemical tests to which I have submitted it have proved the Royal Baking Pow- 
der perfectly healthful, of uniform, excellent quality, and free from any deleterious 
substance. 

Wm. McMurtie, E. M., Ph. D., 
Chemist in Chief U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 



I have examined a package of Royal Baking Powder, purchased by myself in 
the market. I find it entirely free from alum, terra alba, or other injurious sub- 
stances. 

Henry Morton, Ph. D., 
Preset Stevens Institute of Technology, N. J. 



I have recently examined the Royal Baking Powder, and have found it entirely 
free from adulteration and injurious substances of all kinds. I have several times 
before tested the Royal Baking Powder, and have always found it, just as in my 
present examination, skillfully compounded and composed of the purest materials.
