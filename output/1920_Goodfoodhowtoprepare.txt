! PREFACE 



The lessons herewith presented are not merely on 
cooking, but on the healthful preparation of food so 
that it will be wholesome as well as appetizing. It is 
recognized that there is a very close relation between 
diet and health, diet and efficiency, diet and morals. It 
has been said, " The soul that would soar has often been 
fettered by a pork-and-pancake-fed body.*' It has also 
been well said, *' The woman who thoughtfully selects 
proper food and drink for husband, father, brother, or 
little ones, exerts a far-reaching influence toward clean 
thinking and successful achievement." 

Because this book is on healthful cookery, no use is 
made of certain substances sometimes called *' food ad- 
juncts," which are usually spoken of in connection with 
the food principles — I mean spices and condiments. 
These are not foods ; they are not nutritious ; they do the 
body no good, but do their- little part, along with many 
other things, in bringing on old age and the early break- 
ing down of the vital organs. A Paris physician has 
shown that the acid of vinegar is twice as active as alco- 
hol in producing degeneration of the arteries, and that 
pepper is six times as active. Persons who eat an abun- 
dance of fruit generally find that they do not crave con- 
diments and spices. • .

INTRODUCTION 

PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 

It has been said that " eating is a necessity, but cooking is an 
art." Every housewife and mother should be an artist in preparing 
food for her family. She should indeed regard cooking as one of the 
finer arts, to which she can aftord to give nothing less than the best 
that is in her. 

More than that, cooking has come to be a science which should 
be mastered by every one upon whose work depend health, happi- 
ness, even life itself. It is a profession which deserves and demands 
the most careful and thoughtful attention. As the artist expresses 
himself in the picture he paints, and the writer in the story he pens, 
so the artist-mother may express herself through the medium of her 
labor for the benefit of her family. While thus enthusiastically put- 
ting herself into her work, she will gain a pleasure and satisfaction 
from it which will well repay her for her effort. Then, far from 
finding housework a drudgery, her life will be a pleasure not only 
to herself but to her family. While it is frequently true that " those 
persons whom God hath joined together in matrimony, ill-cooked 
joints and badly boiled potatoes have put asunder," the exact opposite 
of this may and should be true. 

A food is a substance which, when taken into the body, supplies 
heat and energy, builds tissue, repairs waste, and regulates body 
processes. 

Cooking is the art of preparing food for the table by the appli- 
cation of heat and by dressing. It prepares food for easier digestion, 
and should change all the food principles, with the exception of fat, 
in a way somewhat similar to the way in which they are changed by 
the process of digestion. Poor cooking often renders food less digest- 
ible, and sometimes results in digestive disturbances, headaches, and 
other ills, and may even be the cause of a craving for strong drink 
and tobacco. 

The objects sought in cooking should be to render food more di- 
gestible, to develop food flavors, to make it more palatable and more 
attractive. 

Water boils at 212° F. Water cannot be made hotter than this 
in an open kettle, therefore it is a waste of fuel to build a hotter 
fire after boiling has begun, in the hope of hastening the cooking. 

Food should be put to cook in boiling water when the food itself 
is to be eaten, and it is desired to retain its fiavor and nutritive 
constituents. It should be put to cook in cold water when it is de- 
sired to draw out the flavor and nutritive elements into the water, as 
in making broths and soups. 



8 GOOD FOOD 

Frying is not a healthful method of cooking, because it coats the 
food with fat, thus sealing it from the action of the digestive juices 
of the mouth and stomach, fat being digested only in the intestine. 
Emulsified fats, or those which mix with water, interfere with the 
digestion of food less than free fats, or those that do not mix with 
water. Fats may be used in moderate quantities in seasoning foods, 
but it is better not to cook fats into foods. 

POINTERS ON BECOMING A SUCCESSFUL COOK 

It has been said that in order to be a success in ajiy line of work, 
one must first be a success in one's own body. This means that he 
must be master of himself. A theoretical and practical knowledge 
of one's line of work is not all that is necessary. Success depends 
upon the character of the person as well as upon his knowledge. 
Even one's disposition may make or mar one's success in life. Po- 
liteness and an attractive manner are recognized as good business 
qualifications. 

These truths apply in the profession of cooking as well as in any 
other, though, sad to say, many cooks develop an unpleasant dispo- 
sition, and forget that politeness should have a place in the kitchen 
as well as in the parlor. 

"The art of cookery is as old as history; its development meas 
ures the development of civilization. More people are engaged in 
cooking during all or a part of their time than in any other occupa- 
tion. On the selection and preparation of food depends, more than 
on any other single factor, the health and consequent happiness and' 
prosperity of mankind." — American School of Home Econom^ics. 

" Practice makes perfect " is an old saying. Whether it is true 
depends upon how the practising is done. If every time we do a 
thing we strive to do it a little better than we did it the last time, we 
may hope to come very close to perfection. We should not be con- 
tented to do a thing as well as some one else does it. '* Do him 
one better." Those who make their mark are not always the ones 
who do things that no one else has done, but those who do things 
better than any one else has done them. Large sums of money are 
sometimes paid for a few minutes' work because the man who does 
the work is an expert in that line, and can do what no one else can 
do, or because he can give an expert opinion which is regarded as 
safe advice. 

There are some qualifications that are particularly necessary in 
cooks. These are neatness, carefulness, accuracy; the possession, 
either by nature or cultivation, of a certain refinement of taste which 
makes one do things daintily and tastily; the ability to think and 
act quickly, to keep many things in mind at once,^ — to tend many 
irons; lo keep his temper, and to be self-possessed, no matter how 
hurr)p(\ he may be. Temper is too good a thing to los^. When one 



INTRODUCTION 9 

loses that, he loses power, as well as the respect of his fellow work- 
ers. If his fellow workers recognize him as an authority upon his 
subject, it will never be necessary for him to " show his authority." 
He must be observant, ready to take suggestions. 

With the recognition of the fact that cooking is a science, the 
idea that a really proficient cook need not measure his ingredients is 
passing away. Of course there are some simple things which may be 
made without taking the trouble to measure exactly, but in the mak- 
ing of other than the simple things, cooks have in the past depended 
upon " luck," which is really the natural result of their good or 
poor work. The materials used in cooking are governed by the laws 
of nature, physical and chemical, which are God's laws, and God has 
so arranged it that under the same conditions the same laws oper- 
ate uniformly; therefore we may be sure that desired results will 
always follow accurate work. This means that if we have a good 
recipe and follow it exactly, we shall get the same results every time. 

Young cooks often fail in the proper seasoning of foods. This 
seems such a minor part of the recipe that the attention is mainly 
given to the principal ingredients, and the seasoning is slighted; but 
when tested by eating, the seasoning is found to be " the making or 
the marring" of the dish. 

Another matter which sometimes escapes the attention of young 
cooks is the necessity of keeping the kitchen neat and clean. The 
preparation of the food seems to engage their whole attention, and 
the kitchen is left to take care of itself, — and it fails to keep itself 
tidy. My mother used to say, " Anybody can clean, but it takes some 
one who is neat to keep clean.'' I have found that the old dictum, 
the only way to conquer dirt is by " eternally keeping at it," is true. 

Many girls have grown up to dislike housework and cooking. One 
reason of their distaste for these tasks is because they have never 
been taught to do them well. We generally like what we do well; 
therefore if we study these tasks as a science with a view to doing 
them in the best possible way, we shall come to enjoy them. 

It is very often not the tasks themselves that are disagreeable, 
but the way they are done. Innumerable inventions have been made 
to simplify other lines of the world's work. A few have been made 
to simplify home duties. We should make use of these, and study 
to discover others. In this study of Domestic Science, young women 
can find as profitable and enjoyable employment as in other lines of 
work, and more profitable if we consider the rewards not only in 
dollars and cents but in human lives. 

FOOD PRINCIPLES 

There are seven so-called " food principles," namely, starch, sugar, 
fat, protein, mineral salts, vitamines, and water. Cellulose, while 
not usually included among the food principles, \a so \Ta^oT\.^.xsX \\\. \\v^.

INTRODUCTION 11 

diet that it is well to include it among them, so as to provide for it 
in arranging " balanced meals." 

Most foods consist of mixtures of these food principles. In many 
foods some one of these principles predominates. Hence to Increase 
any one of these food principles in the diet, one would use a larger 
quantity of those foods in which the desired food principle predomi- 
nates; or to decrease any one of the food principles, one would avoid 
those foods in which that particular principle predominates. 

The food principles are grouped into classes according to their use 
in the body. They may be grouped first into two classes, one includ- 
ing the substances the body uses for fuel and building material — 
the starch, sugar, fat, and protein; the other including those sub- 
stances without which the body would not have the power to use 
the materials included in the first group, — the substances that keep 
the body in health, and enable it to keep up its vital activities; 
namely, the mineral salts, vitamines, cellulose, and water. 

The first of these two classes is subdivided. The starch, sugar, 
and fat are grouped together as warmth-and-work foods ; for the body 
uses these as sources of heat to keep the body warm and to support 
its activities, just as an engine must burn coal to develop power, 
and in the burning of the coal heat is evolved. These foods are also 
called '* non-nitrogenous." 

The protein stands in a class by itself, and is building food. It 
is this kind of food that the body must have to build itself and keep 
itself in repair. This food principle is spoken of as " nitrogenous." 
Nitrogenous foods can be used in the body as warmth-and-work food, 
but are not an economical source of heat and energy. Their office is 
to build up and to keep in repair that most complicated machine, the 
human body. In that respect this food principle corresponds to the 
metal of which an engine is built. 

About one eighth of our* food should consist of protein, or build- 
ing food; another eighth may consist of fat; and the rest, or three 
fourths, should consist of starch and sugar, mostly starch. 

The accompanying diagram (page 10) shows the classification of 
foods according to the food principle that predominates in each. 

Since our diet should consist so largely of warmth-and-work 
foods, one or two eggs, a glass of milk, a helping of beans, a help- 
ing of cottage cheese, or a few nuts will furnish all the building 
food that is needed at a meal. The rest of the meal may consist 
of warmth-and-work foods and foods that supply bulk. 

The second of the two classes into which we first grouped the 
food principles, includes the mineral salts and vitamines, also water 
and cellulose. 

The mineral salts are needed by the body for building its 
hard tissues, such as bones, teeth, hair, skin, and finger nails, and 
also as regulators of body processes. They are nature's medicines, 
the substances that enable the body to carry on ita N\t«i\ ^.^\.\n\XX^'«»

and to resist disease. They are of great importance, and the diet 
should be so chosen as not to exclude these. The foods that are 
lacking in mineral salts are white flour and bread, cakes, etc., 
made from it, sugar and sweetened foods, meat, and vegetables that 
have been boiled and the water thrown away. 

The cellulose is not digestible, but is needed in the digestive 
tract for bulk. " The interior of the body needs a daily scrub, as 
well as its exterior," and foods in which indigestible substance pre- 
dominates, act as a broom to sweep out the alimentary tract and 
keep it clean. The foods that are lacking in cellulose are milk, eggs, 
meat, white rice, white flour, and sugar, and foods made from white 
flour and sugar. The foods that supply an abundance of cellulose 
are fruits, vegetables, whole cereals, bran, and flours made from 
whole cereals. 

Vitamines are necessary to promote growth and to protect the 
body from disease. The growth-promoting vitamines are found in 
milk, cream, butter, and green leaves; the disease-preventing vita- 
mines are in bran, whole cereals, vegetables, and fruits. 

Water constitutes about 60 per cent of the body, and is needed to 
form the chief ingredient of all the fluids of the body, to dissolve 
food, to dissolve and carry off waste material, to render the tissues 
soft, and to regulate the heat of the body. 

Condiments are sometimes mentioned as " food adjuncts." They 
are not foods. They benumb the taste, are apt to cause one to over 
eat, are irritating and liable to cause digestive disturbance, and 
may cause a thirst that will demand something stronger than water. 

MEASURING FOOD VALUES 

The unit by which the energy value of food to the body is meas- 
ured is called a " calorie." A calorie is the amount of heat required 
to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one degree Centi- 
grade, or approximately two quarts of water one degree Fahrenheit. 
A heat unit can be used to measure food values because it is by the 
oxidation of food in the body that the body gets energy out of it. 

1 ounce of protein yields 116 calories. 

1 ounce of carbohydrate yields 116 calories. 

1 ounce of fat yields 264 calories. 

A person weighing 150 pounds and doing light work requires 
food yielding 2,300 calories a day. Of this 10 per cent, or 230 calories, 
should be from protein; 25 to 30 per cent, or 560 to 690 calories, from 
fat ; and the remainder from carbohydrate, or in other words, sugars 
and starches. 

To supply 2,300 calories a day requires, of water-free food, about 
16 ounces, of which 2 ounces should be protein, 2 ounces fat, and 12 
ounces carbohydrate. One eighth of our food should be protein. 

The table on pages 14-16 will enable one to select foods that, while 
affording needed bulk, will also supply the required food principles, 



INTRODUCTION 13 

k Absolute accuracy is not claimed for the figures given. The weights 
assigned to the several measures are the result of only a limited 
\ number of experiments, but it is believed that they are sufficiently 
t accurate for practical purposes. 

■ c 

1 FOOD COMBINATIONS 

In selecting foods we are not to consider calories alone; proper 
combinations are also important, and these we consider for two pur- 
poses: First, that we may eat at the same meal only foods that digest 
well together; second, that we may combine foods in such a way 
as to supply all the food principles in about the right proportion. 

} Foods that digest well together are: 

\ Grains and fruits. 

* Grains and vegetables. 

i Grains and nuts. 

Grains and milk. 

Grains and eggs. 

Grains, fruits, and nuts. 

Grains, vegetables, and nuts. 

Foods that do not digest well together are: 
Fruits and coarse vegetables. 
Milk and sugar in large quantities. 
Mush and milk and sugar. 

A fair combination is milk and fruit. 

Fats in proper amount, and preferably in the forms suggested in 
the table of "Classification of Foods" (page 10), are usually quite 
easily digested; but when fats are used in frying, combinations are 
formed which are exceedingly difficult of digestion. 

To combine foods in such a way as to supply all the needed food 
compounds, we should choose something from each of the different 
classes of food principles; that is, some foods supplying building 
material, some supplying fat, some supplying starch and sugar. And 
be sure that there are included among these, foods that supply cellu- 
lose and mineral elements. 

I will give menus of some poor meals, and tell why they are poor, 
that we may understand the more fully, by contrast, what a good 
meal is.

Such a meal would be made up too largely of warmth-and-work 
food. It lacks building food, bulk, and mineral salts. 

No. 3 

. Vegetable Soup Carrots String Beans 

Lettuce Tomatoes 

Strawberries and Cream 

Such a meal would contain too little building food and too little 
warmXh-and-work food. It is too bulky, and i& lacking in nourish- 
ment. It also shows the poor combination of fruits and vegetables. 

To make a balanced meal, it would be necessary to choose some- 
thing from each of these poor meals. It is not necessary to choose 
a large variety in order to supply all the needs of the body. For 
instance, a breakfast consisting only of oatmeal, milk, and prunes 
would contain everything essential to a balanced meal. 

The following are examples of balanced jneals:

Raw foods contain some substances which are very necessary for 
health, but which are destroyed by cooking. These substances s[^em 
not only to have a beneficial effect upon the general health, but to 
arouse or increase the activity ol!, the digestive juities. For this rea- 
son some raw food should b^-eM^la every day, if not at every meal. 
It is well to eat raw all food that nature has made to be eaten raw, 
such as celery, lettuce, cabbage, nuts, and fruits; and even raw car- 
rots and turnips, chopped fin^e, niake a very appetizing salad, and are 
more easily digested than when cooked.

COOKING PROCESSES 

Cooking is both a science and an art. As a science we have said 
itij^to preparei^food for digestion, — to make such changes In It that 
it will -be. In a proper condition to be acted upon by the digestive 
fluids. It breaks up Its organic structure, as in the softening pro- 
duced In a potato or an apple by baking, In cereals and legumes by 
bolljlng, or In vegetables by boiling or steaming. It produces chem- 
icaf changes, such as the change of starch from insoluble to soluble 
t)y boiling and to dextrin by browning. It destroys living organ- 
isms, or germs (they may be disease germs or the organisms that 
cause food to spoil), as In sterilizing milk, and In cooking fruits and 
Veg^&bled in the process of canning. 

^■' Of cooking as an art it has been said, "The fine art of cookery 
conslste In developing the full natural flavor of the foods themselves 
and in combining them In pleasing ways." 

Under this phase we notice that cooking changes the appearance 
of food. A raw potato does not look very appetizing, but the sight of 
a hot baked potato may " make the mouth water." Cooking develops 
food flavors. The flavor of raw beans does not appeal to us, but one 
enjoys sitting down to a dish of well-baked beans when he is very 
hungry. Cooking also produces changes In temperature. We can 
iwSrve soup hot, or a dessert cold, or even frozen. 

The different methods of applying heat to food are the following: 

Bollinj^. — Cooking food In actively boiling water. Water is 
.said to boil when bubbles of steam rise through the water and break 
at the surface, causing steam to be given off rapVdXy. N^^\.^^ \iQ\\^ 



22 GOOD FOOD 

at 212° F. The loss of heat from the surface of the water in boiling 
is rapid enough to prevent the temperature of the water from going 
above 212° F. No matter how hot the flre, the temperature of boiling 
water in an open or simply covered kettle cannot be made hotter. 
The temperature of water can be made hotter than 212° F. by con- 
fining it under pressure while heat is applied, as is done in a pressure 
canning outfit. For this reason it is a waste of fuel to build a hotter 
fire for the purpose of hastening the cooking process after boiling 
has once begun. 

Simmering. — Slow, steady boiling. 

Stewing. — Long, steady cooking in a small quantity of liquid 
at a temperature a few degrees below the boiling point (160° to 180® 
F.). Cooking in this manner can be conveniently accomplished in a 
double boiler. The principal difference between boiling and stewing 
is that, in boiling, the vegetable alone is eaten, while in stewing, the 
vegetable and the water in which it is cooked are served together. 

Baking. — Cooking in an oven in heated air, by radiation. 
Only foods containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted 
to this method. Slow oven, 270° to 350° F.; moderate oven, 350° to 
400° F.; quick oven, 400° to 480° F. 

Broiling. — Cooking a small piece of an article of food before 
or over glowing coals or under gas, by radiant heat. 

Roasting. — Cooking a large piece of food material before 
glowing coals. This method was used when the cooking was done by 
open fireplaces. It has now been largely superseded by baking in the 
oven. 

Steaming. — Cooking by steam in a closed vessel with a per- 
forated bottom over boiling water. Temperature, 212° F. Cooking 
in a double boiler may be called dry steaming, the temperature being 
from 192° to 200? F. 

Frying. — Cooking in deep fat at a temperature of from 360<) 
to 400° F., a method not to be recommended from the standpoint of 
wholesomeness. As a rule, fat is rendered less wholesome by cooking. 

Sauteing (pronounced so-tayMng), often called '* frjiiig/*— 

Cooking in a small quantity of fat in a shallow pan. This is worse, 
from a health standpoint, than frying in deep hot fat, because it 
permits more fat to soak into the food. 

Pan-broiling. — Cooking on a hot griddle that has been oiled 
only enough to prevent the food from sticking to it. 

Extracting and Retaining Flavors. — When it is desired to 
extract the nutritive constituents and flavoring matter from any 
food substance, as in making broth, put the food to cook in cold 
water. When it is desired to retain the nutritive elements and flavor 
io the food, put it to cook in boiling water. 



INTRODUCTION 23 

Experiments 

Make the following experiments to determine the effect of hot 
water and of cold water on the different food principles: 

No. 1 

Place a thin slice of stale bread in a moderately heated oven, and 
allpw it to remain, watching it, till thoroughly dry throughout and 
lightly browned. When cool, taste it. Notice that it tastes different 
from untoasted bread. Bread contains a large proportion of starch. 
Heating it till it turns light brown partially changes the starch to 
dextrin, a form of carbohydrate intermediate between starch and 
sugar. Starch foods prepared in this way may be said to be par- 
tially predigested. 

No. 2 

Into a tin cup, or a small agateware or aluminum vessel that holds 
about one-half pint, put one-fourth cup cold water. Then stir into the 
water one-fourth teaspoon cornstarch. Allow it to stand a few mo- 
ments. Notice that the starch does not dissolve in the water, but 
gradually settles to the bottom. Now stir up the starch again, set 
the cup on the stove, and heat it very gradually, stirring contin- 
uously. Notice that when the temperature of the water approaches 
the boiling point, the mixture gradually thickens and becomes clear. 
This is because hot water bursts the starch granules, they dissolve, 
take up water, and swell, forming a pasty mixture. 

No. 3 

Wash the cup and again put into it one-fourth cup cold water. 
Stir into the water one tablespoon sugar. Notice that the sugar 
dissolves slowly. Heat this mixture, and notice that the sugar dis- 
solves rapidly in hot water. No other change in the sugar can be 
detected by the eye by simply boiling. But a very small quantity 
of the sugar is changed to what is called invert sugar, a noncrystal- 
lizing sugar. If boiled with an acid, the sugar gradually becomes 
entirely changed to noncrystallizing sugar. If a large quantity of 
sugar and water is used, sufficient so that it can be tested by a ther- 
mometer as it boils, it will be noticed that as the liquid evaporate^, 
the temperature of the boiling mass rises, and when it reaches a 
little above 300° F., it begins to turn brown, or carmelize. Candy 
makers take advantage of this fact, because the degree of density of 
the sirup is indicated by the temperature. 

When sugar and water are boiled together till the temperature 
is 238° F., the sirup has reached what is called the " soft-ball " stage, 
because when a little of it is dropped into ice water, it forms a soft 
ball; or If a fork is dipped into the sirup and lifted out, the sirup 
forms a " thread " as it drips from the fork. This is the stage to 
which sirup should be boiled in making frosting aiv^ j(^^^^%^. 



24 GOOD FOOD 

At 254° F. the sirup is said to have reached the " hard-ball " stage, 
because when a little of it is dropped into ice water i-t forms a hard 
ball. This is the stage to which sugar is boiled in making caramels. 

At 260° to 275° F. it has reached the " crack stage," because at 
this stage it becomes snappy and brittle when, dropped into ice water. 
This is the stage to which sugar is boiled in making taffy. 

At 290° F. it has reached the "hard crack" stage, at which It 
becomes very hard and brittle when dropped into ice water. This is 
the stage to which sugar is boiled in making peanut candy. 

When boiled above 300° F., the sirup gradually changes color 
from light yellow to brown, then red, and if the cooking continues 
it turns black and smokes. For use in coloring and flavoring, water 
is added to the cooking mass to dissolve it when it reaches the right 
shade. Caramelized sugar of a light-brown color, so dissolved, is used 
in flavoring custards, ice creams, and other desserts. That of a 
dark-red color is used for coloring gravies and soups. 

No. 4 

Into the same cup used in the previous experiment put one-foufUi 
cup cold water, and stir into it one teaspoon vegetable cooking oil. 
Notice that the oil neither dissolves nor mixes with the water, 
but floats on top. Now set the cup on the stove, and heat tiU the 
water boils. Notice that the boiling produces no change in the fttt. 
It does not dissolve nor mix with the water. Fat is not changed at 
the temperature of boiling water, but at higher temperatures the fat 
is decomposed, or split up, into fatty acid and glycerin. 

Different fats decompose at different temperatures. Butter be- 
gins to decompose at about 256° F., and lard at 360°, beef suet at 
440°, cottolene at 450°, refined cottonseed oil and olive oil at 600**. 
Fatty acid is irritating to the system. At 500° F. and above, the 
glycerin is changed into acrolein. This is the substance that gives 
the smarting sensation to the eyes, nose, and throat when fats are 
overheated. It is very irritating to the mucous membrane. It is the 
substance that is produced in the burning of cigarette paper, from 
the glycerin in the paper; and in the smoking of cigarettes more 
harmful results are attributed to the acrolein than to the nicotine In 
the tobacco. 

It will be noticed that butter would be the worst fat to use in 
frying, because it decomposes at the lowest temperature of all fats. 

No. 5 

Again, put into the cup one-fourth cup of cold water. Then stir 
into the water one teaspoon of egg white, which is practically pure 
albumen, or protein food substance. Set the cup on the stove and 
heat gradually. Notice that as the water heats, it becomes cloudy. 
because the egg white in it turns white and hardens; and the hotter 



IXri(ODUCTIO.\ 



25 



the water, the tonpher the egg white becomes. This teachea hb that 
protein food substance is hardened and toughened hy heat; and the 
greater the heat, the tougher the substance becomes. For this reason, 
eSRS and other protein-containing foods are more digestible when 
cooked at a low temperature than when Bubjected to too great a 
degree of heat. 

The experiments with the food elements may he made with test- 
tubes and an alcohol lamp if these are at hand.

CEREALS 



Cereals are the seeds of cultivated grasses. In them is stored 
the nourishment on which the young plant grows when it begins life. 
This nourishment is stored in a permanent form in which it will not 
easily deteriorate, because it must not decay from harvest time to 
planting time. It is in a dry, concentrated, insoluble form. When 
the seed is planted, it absorbs water; the diastase becomes active, 
and changes the raw, insoluble starch to sugar, which is soluble and 
ready to be used to nourish the young plant. 

THE COOKING OF CEREALS 

In order to prepare cereals for our nourishment, a somewhat sim- 
ilar change must be brought about in them as that by which nature 
prepares them for plant food. This is done by the use of water and 
heat in cooking. The cereal absorbs the water, the heat causes the 
starch to become soluble, or to dissolve in the water, and the heat 
also softens the cellulose framework of the cereal. To render the 
starch soluble requires a comparatively short time, but to soften the 
cellulose thoroughly may require several hours' cooking, according 
to the size of the grain or the fineness to which it has been ground. 

To cook cereals a sufficient length of time, a double boiler is 
necessary. This insures proper cooking of the cereal without scorch- 
ing it, and prevents the pastiness caused by long, active boiling. 

A fireless cooker is ideally adapted to the cooking of cereals. To 
cook some cereals a sufficient length of time necessitates cooking 
them the previous day if they are to be used for breakfast, then 
reheating them in the double boiler in the morning. In a fireless 
cooker the cereal will cook during the night, and be warm for break- 
fast, or require only a short heating. 

That the cooked cereal may always have the proper consistency, 
definite proportions of water and cereal should be used. 

Cream is a sufficient dressing for cereals. They are largely car- 
bohydrate, and to add sugar to them is like carrying coals to New- 
castle. But cream supplies fat, in which cereals are deficient. Eat- 
ing sugar on cereals is like eating sugar on bread and butter. Ce- 
reals digest better if eaten without sugar. Stirring raisins, stoned 
dates, or chopped figs into the cereal before it is served, is better than 
using sugar, with it. It is well to eat something hard, like zwieback, 
with cereals, to encourage mastication; or nuts may be sprinkled 
over the dish of cereal. 

Cereals being so largely starch, their digestion is begun by the 
saliva in the mouth; therefore they should be well masticat*»d.

GENERAL RULES J^OR THE PROPORTION OF WATER 

TO GRAIN 

Scotch oatmeal ("steel-cut oatmeal ") and all wheat preparations 
except whole wheat, rolled wheat, and ^Graham flour, require four 
measures of water to one of cereal. 

Whole wheat requires three measures of water to one of cerdat. 

Rolled wheat, rolled oats, and rolled rye require two measures bt 
water to one of cereal. 

Graham flour requires t\yo or three measures of water to One ojf 
flour, according to the quality of the flourl 

Corn preparations (cornmeal, hominy, etc.) and barley require 
five measures of water to one of cereal. 

Rice, when cooked in a double boiler, requires three or four meas- 
ures of water to one of rice,- according to the size and quality of the 
rice. , , _ _ . _ .:-.....■ 

If the grains are cooked in the afternoon and warmed up the ne:3ct 
morning, more water will be required. Fine wheat preparations and 
cornmeal will require six measures of. water to one of cereal. Rolled 
cereals will require three measures of water to one of cereal^ 

Use one teaspoon salt to one and one-half pints water. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS i 

1. Measure both water and cereal with cups of the same size. 

2. Have the water boiling in the inner cup of the double 1)oiIer, 
set directly over the fire, that is, without the outside boiler. 

3. Stir the cereal into the water slowly enough not to stop the 
boiling of the water. 

4. Continue the boiling and stirring till the cereal thickens tlie 
water. 

5. Set the inner cup of the double boiler into the outer cup, which 
contains boiling water. 

6. Do not stir the cereal after this. 

7. Keep the water in the outer boiler boiling for the required 
length of time to cook the cereal. 

Whole grains, especially flaked grains, should not be stirred dur- 
ing cooking, because this will break or crush the grains and produce 
a pasty mass. 

Flaked grains, such as rolled wheat, rolled oats, and rolled rye, 
should not be boiled directly over the fire. To avoid breaking the 
flakes, have the water in both inner and outer parts of the double 
boiler boiling, the former placed inside the latter, and the salt added 
to the water in the inner cup. Carefully stir the flakes into the 
water, put the cover on the kettle, and do not stir again, unless it is 
necessary to lift carefully the flakes in the water. Simply allow 
the cereal to cook the required length of time in the double boiler. 



CEREALS 29 

TIME REQUIRED FOR COOKING CEREALS 

Rice cooked in a double boiler, and fine cereal preparations, one 
hour. 

Rolled oats, rolled wheat, and rolled rye, three to four hours. 
. Cracked wheat, oatmeal, and fine hominy, four to five hours. 

Whole wheat, pearl barley, and coarse hominy, six hours. 

It has been said that wheat contains all the. food principles re- 
quired to nourish the body, in about the right proportion. This is 
true of the proportion of protein and carbohydrate, but not of the 
proportion of fat. Cereals are deficient in fat. This fat, however. Is 
supplied by the foods that are usually eaten with cereals. Neither 
are the mineral salts present in the right proportion. Cereals con- 
tain too much magnesium and too little lime. 

It has been known that white-fiour products do not properly nour- 
ish young children, and it has been supposed that whole-wheat prep- 
arations would keep them in health, but this has been found to be 
untrue. Some other food must be supplied that contains more lime 
and less magnesium. Milk is such a food. Nuts also contain more 
lime than cereals contain. Milk and nuts, therefore, balance cereals 
in making up their deficiency of fat and in giving the proper pro- 
portion of mineral salts. Fruits and new vegetables also contain 
moW lime than magnesium, and for that reason may supplement a 
diet of cereals. 

The benefit to be derived from the use of cereals is due to the 
fact that cereals, used as cereals, are mostly whole-cereal prepara- 
tions, and if white bread is the only food prepared from cereals that 
the person has been eating, benefit might be derived from eating 
preparations of whole cereals. If the person has been in the habit 
of eating bread made from whole cereals, no great benefit Would prob- 
abiy be derived from the addition of breakfast cereals to the diet. 

•Some years ago, when cereals began to be used in the form of 
mush, wholeKjereal preparations were used; but it seems that people 
will have reilned foods, and now there are on the market cereal 
preparations that are no better than white-fiour products, important 
parts of the grain, such as the bran and germ, having been removed, 
^ream of whfeat, for instAnce, would more properly be called " starch 
of wheat." It is nearly as deficient in mineral salts and cellulose 
as is white flour. 

Oats contain the largest proportion of fat and protein. Yellow 
corn comes next in fat content, wheat comes next to oats in protein 
content. Rice contains the smallest proportion of fat and protein. 
Oats digest least easily. Rice digests most easily. The oat grain has 
been tampered with less than other cereals in preparing it for eating. 

The nitrogenous part of wheat, its building food, is called gluten. 
The nitrogenous part of corn is called zein. Zein is different trota 
the protein cwstituents of other cereals. It lacks aom^ ol Wv^ ^xcCvci^

It will be seen that the total nutritive value of cereals is about 
three times that of lean beef, about the same as beans, and about 
one half that of nuts. 

Since one ounce of protein or carbohydrate yields 116 caloriM

RECIPES 

CORNMEAL 
Golden Grains 

2^2 cups water 
^ cup cornmeal 

1 teaspoon salt 

Heat the water to boiling in the inner cup of the double boiler. 
Add the salt. With a batter whip stir the cornmeal into the water. 
Continue stirring until the mixture is thickened, then set the inner 
cup in the outer cup of the double boiler, which contains boiling 
water, and continue cooking one hour. Serve with cream or maple 
sirup. If desired, three-fourths cup of dates that have been washed, 
stoned, and cut into small pieces, may be stirred into the cereal be- 
fore serving, making Golden Grains with Dates. Serve with cream. 

Baked Cornmeal Cubes 

Use two cups water, instead of two and one-half as in the pre- 
ceding recipe. After the cereal has cooked the required length of 
time, turn it into a bread tin that has been wet with cold water. 
After it gets cold, cut around it and remove it from the tin. Slice 
it into one-inch slices, and cut the slices into one-inch cubes. Beat 
two eggs slightly, and add to them two tablespoons of water and a 
few grains of salt. Roll the cubes in fine zwieback crumbs, dip them 
into the egg mixture, then roll them again in the crumbs. Lay the 
cubes on an oiled pan, and bake in a hot oven till nicely browned. 
Serve with maple sirup. 

FLAKES 
Rolled Oats. Rolled Wheat, or Rulled Rye 

2 cups water 

1 cup of the cereal 
% teaspoon salt 

Have the two parts of the double boiler together, with water in 
the outer part, and the two cups of water and the salt in the inner 
part. Let the double boiler sit over the fire until the water in the 
outer part has been boiling five minutes, to heat the water in the 
inner part. Carefully stir the fiakes into the water. Put the cover 
on the kettle, and allow the cereal to cook three hours. Add boiling 
water to the outer kettle as may be necessary during the cooking. 
Serve with cream. 

BARLEY 
Pearl Barley

Put the barley into a small saucepan. Pour boiling water over it, 
and whip it with a batter whip. Pour oft the ^atftx. 'Povxx wi\si^\^

boiling water, whip again, and pour off the water. Repeat the proc- 
ess till the barley is thoroughly clean, and the water that is poured 
off is clear. Put the washed barley, water, and salt into the inner 
part of a double boiler, and put the two parts of the double boiler 
together, with boiling water in the outer part, and continue the 
cooking for five hours, keeping the cover on the inner part of the 
double boiler, of course. Or the barley may be cooked in a fireless 
cooker. If so small a quantity of cereal as this recipe calls for is 
cooked in a fireless cooker, it will be necessary to use heated soap- 
stones in the cooker, or to set the dish containing the cereal in a 
larger dish of boiling water, in order to have a sufficient volume of 
heat to hold the cereal at the cooking temperature for a sufficient 
length of time. Even then it may be well to remove the cereal from 
the cooker and reheat it once during the cooking. Serve with cream. 

To stir raisins into cooked pearl barley makes a palatable blend 
of flavors. Use three-fourths cup to the quantity of cereal given in 
the preceding recipe. 

To cook cracked wheat, whole wheat, Scotch oatmeal, or coarse 
hominy, follow the directions given for cooking pearl barley, varying 
the quantity of water according to the cereal. Stirring figs cut in 
ijmall pieces into cooked Scotch oatmeal makes a very palatable dish. 

MUSH 
Gluten Mush 

1 pint water 
% cup gluten meal 
% teaspoon salt 

Stir the gluten into the boiling salted water and cook till thick. 

Cream Gluten Mush 

1 pint milk or thin cream 
1-2 cup gluten meal 
% teaspoon salt 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Stir in the gluten, and cook in 
the double boiler till thick. 

Gluten Mush with Dates 

Stone and cut into small pieces enough dates to make .one-half 
cup. and stir them into Gluten Mush. 

RICE 

Rice is nutritious, easily digested, and a fattening food. But in 
the preparation of white rice the outer coating of bran and mineral 
salts is scoured off, then the rice is coated with glucose and talc. 
This puts a gloss on the rice, and also keeps weevils out of it; but it 
robs the rice of important food substances; yet its total nutritive 
value, due to its protein, fat, and carbohydrates, is only slightly leae 
tJ2an that of other cereals. 



CEREALS 33 

The so-called " unpolished rice " is no more nutritious than ordi- 
nary polished rice. It simply does not have the coating of glucose 
and talc. Rice that has not had the outer coating scoured off is called 
" natural brown " rice. It contains all the nutritive constituents of 
the rice. 

Boiled Riee 

% cup rice 
6 cups boiling water 
2 teaspoons salt v 

Put the rice into a small saucepan, pour hot water over it, whip 
with a batter whip, and pour off the water. Pour on more hot water, 
whip again, and pour off the water. Repeat the process till the rice 
is thoroughly clean, and the water that is poured off is clear. 
Have the six cups of water salted and actively boiling over the fire. 
Stir the washed rice into it. Keep the rice actively boiling for 
twenty minutes, stirring occasionally, to prevent its sticking to the 
bottom of the kettle, then turn it into a colander to drain off the 
water. Hold the colander containing the rice under the cold water 
faucet, and run a large quantity of cold water through the rice till 
all the stickiness is washed from the kernels, so that they remain 
separate and distinct. Then, after the rice is thoroughly drained, 
put it into a double boiler to dry and reheat. Do not stir the rice 
while it is reheating, and in dishing it out handle it very carefully 
so as not to break the kernels or cause them to stick together. Serve 
with cream or fruit sauce. 

This is a wasteful method of cooking rice, if the water is thrown 
away, but it is very difficult to cook rice any other way and have the 
kernels separate. The water in which the rice has been boiled may 
be used in making soup, and thus the nourishment it contains is 
saved. 

Natural brown rice requires longer to cook than white rice. It 
should boil twenty-five minutes, or till the kernels are tender. 

Plain Steamed Rice 

% cup rice 
1% cups boiling water

Wash the rice as directed above. Place the ingredients in a 
double boiler. The water in the outer cup should be boiling. Cook 
one hour. Serve with cream or fruit sauce.

Milk alone may be used, or a larger proportion of cream. 

Put the washed rice, cream, milk, and salt into the inner cup of 
a double boiler, set it in the outer cup, and cook two or three hours, 
or till a creamy mass is produced. This really does not need cream 
as a dressing. It may be served as a vegetable without dressing. It 
makes a very appetizing dish when served with half a canned peach 
on top of each helping, and some of the peach juice poured around it. 

Rice and the coarser cereal preparations are enjoyable served 
with a fruit sauce. Nuts may then be sprinkled over the sauce, 
making the ideal combination of fruits, grains, and nuts. 

SAUCES 
Raspberry Sauce 

A fruit sauce that tastes especially good with cereals is raspberry 
sauce. Rub through a strainer fine enough to hold back the seeds, 
sufficient canned raspberries or fresh raspberry sauce, to make one 
cup. 

1 cup raspberry pulp or juice 

1 tablespoon cornstarch 

1 tablespoon water / 

Heat the raspberry pulp to boiling. With a batter whip stir the 
cornstarch and water together, then stir it into the boiling juice. 
Allow it to cook gently for two minutes. 

Rice, whole or cracked wheat, Scotch oatmeal, and pearl barley, 
served with gravy instead of cream, make palatable and nutritious 
dishes for either breakfast or dinner. Cream sauce may be used, 
or one of the gravies to be used with macaroni, recipes for which 
will be given in another section. 

Cream Sauce 

1 cup milk, or part cream 

2 tablespoons flour 

l^^ tablespoons cold water

Heat the milk to boiling in a double boiler. Put the flour into 
a bowl, and with a batter whip (not a spoon) stir the flour smooth 
with the cold water. Then, using the batter whip, whip the flour 
mixture in a small stream into the hot milk. Allow it to cook Ave 
minutes. Add the salt. 

Unless one has a fireless cooker, those cereal preparations that 
require long cooking are more suitable to be used in the winter time, 
when no extra fire would be necessary in order to cook them the 
required length of tivae.

cup of cold water to boiling, and stir into it the cornstarch mixture. 
Let it boil gently two minutes. Add the sugar and salt and the 
grated yellow rind of half an orange. Be careful to grate off only 
the very outside yellow part of the rind. If a richer sauce is desired, 
after thickening the water with the cornstarch stir a little of the 
sauce into the egg yolk and mix well, then stir the egg yolk into the 
sauce; then add the orange juice. 

DEXTRINIZED CEREALS 

In the process of digestion, starch is changed to a form of sugar. 
It is possible partially to accomplish this by cooking. When starch 
is browned, it is changed to a form of carbohydrate intermediate 
between starch and sugar. Cereal foods in which this has been ac- 
complished may be said to be partially predigested. The browning 
also gives a toasted taste to the cereal, which is palatable for a change. 
It is this change in the starch that gives the palatable flavor to the 
crust of bread. 

Browned Rice 

Pour one-half cup rice into a pie tin. Set it in the oven. Stir 
it occasionally till it is of a light-brown or straw color. Then wash 
and cook this browned rice according to the directions for cooking 
Plain Steamed Rice. Browned rice is not pasty and sticky after it 
is cooked, but light and fluffy. Serve with cream or fruit sauce. 
Orange sauce blends nicely with browned- rice. 

Rolled oats may be toasted slightly before cooking, for a change 
from the. plain cer^. 

Zwieback 

Lay slices of bread on a baking pan and put them into a moderate 
oven to dry out and brown lightly throughout the slices. Zwie- 
back is the ideal toast — better tJM^oast made by simply browning 
the outside of a slice of bread ^^^^ving the inside like a slice of 
fresh bread. Another advantagl^^Vzwieback possesses over other 
cereal foods is that it compels ^Rtication, which is necessary for 
the best digestion of cereal foods. And a change is produced in the 
starch by the browning, so that when zwieback is moistened with 
water or any other liquid, it does not become j)asty. 

Zwieback may be eaten plain, or spread with dairy butter, nut 
butter, jelly, or marmalade. Or it may be used 4n making toasts, 
such as the following:

Blackberry sauce for toast may be made by following the recipe 
for Raspberry Sauce. 

Pear sauce for toast may be made from either canned pears 
or stewed fresh pears. Cut the pears in thin slices. Measure tlie 
juice, heat it to boiling, and thicken it with cornstarch stirred smooth 
with a little cold water, using one tablespoon cornstarch for eseh 
cup of juice. Use a batter whip to stir the starch and cold wattr 
together, then whip the boiling juice with the batter whip while the 
cornstarch mixture is poured in a small stream into it. Put the 
sliced pears into the thickened juice, and allow the whole to remain 
over the stove long enough to heat the pears. 

Peach sauce for toast is prepared in a similar way. 

Blueberry sauce for toast is made by dralMng the juice from 
canned blueberries or fresh stewed blueberries, thickening it. as in

Cherry sauce is made in a similar way, first removing the stones 
from the cherries. _ 

Apple toast, made by servin^tf^apple sauce over slices of zwie-

MACARONI 



Macabom la made from a granular meal, called " semolina," which 
is ground Irom hard, semi translucent varieties or wheat, rich In 
gluten, such aa durum wheat. In the making ol the Bemolina the 
bran of the wheat ia removed, and, by sifting, some of the starchy 
part of the wheat ts eliminated, so that semolina Is richer in gluten 

— the protein part of the wheat, its tlssue-bulldlng food principle 

— than flour made from the same wheat. 

Macaroni has the same high food value in protein and carhohy- 
drate that the semolina, has, but it is just as " impoverished " a food 
in eeliulose and mineral salts as white fiour or white bread or 
white rice, and, like other wheat products, it ia deficient in fat; 
therefore there Is need of combining with it other foods that supply 
what it lacks. Milk and eggs furnish some of the compounds 




Huinnl of DUTi 



lacking in macaroni. The tomato sauce bo often served with it sup- 
plies mineral salts. The cheese with which macaroni is perhaps 
most often prepared is lacking in mineral salts. And macaroni, 
In all the ways in which It la served, is lacking In hulk or cellulose. 

The best macaroni is smooth and elastic, has a creamy color, and 
looks somewhat translucent. It JMeaks with a smooth, glassy frac- 
ture, and does not split when ^fken. The inferior quality that 
contains coloring matter ia rough, has a floury instead of glassy 
appearance, and splits on breaking. 

The method of cooking macaroni is similar to that of boiling 
rice. Macaroni should not be washed or soaked. Washing or soak- 
ing softens the outside of the macaroni, so that the tubes stick 
together, making a pasty mass; while well-coolfed macaroni is slip- 
pery, every piece being whole and separate. II \l seetM, T\'*fiessa.t-i

to clean macaroni, it may be wiped with a dry Cloth, but, really, 
macaroni should be as clean when it comes to you as when it is made, 
and should require no cleaning. 

The macaroni should be broken in inch lengths, or the ready-cut 
macaroni may be used, which is more convenient and needs no 
breaking. The macaroni should be put to cook in actively boiling 
salted water, using two quarts of water and three teaspoons of salt 
to each cup of macaroni, and boiled rapidly from twenty minutes to 
one hour, according to the age and size of the macaroni, stirring it 
occasionally so that it will not stick to the bottom of the saucepan. 
When done, the macaroni is soft enough to be easily mashed between 
the thumb and finger. The whole should then be poured in a col- 
ander to drain off the water, and cold water should be run through 
it to prevent the tubes from sticking to one another. 

For those who like it, garlic makes an enjoyable flavoring for 
macaroni. 

While the following recipes call for macaroni, there are a great 
many different shapes and sizes which have different names. Some 
of the names are: Spaghetti, vermicelli, macaroncelli, rigatoni, ziti, 
fettuce. The smaller kinds, like vermicelli, and those shaped like 
seeds, stars, letters, rice, shells, and rings of various small sizes, are 
best adapted for use in soups. Most of the other kinds could be 
substituted for the plain macaroni in the recipes.

2 tablespoons nut butter 

2 cups hot water 

2% tablespoons flour 
% teaspoon salt 

1 to .11/^ teaspoons sage 
Cook the macaroni according to directions. Put the nut butter 
into .a small saucepan, and with a batter whip stir a little of the 
hot water into it and stir till smooth. Continue stirring in water 
till all the water is used and the whole is perfectly smooth. Put 
it on the stove and heat to boiling, watching it carefully, because it 
is very likely to boil over as soon as it begins to boil. Stir the flour 
smooth with two tablespoons of cold water, and stir it into the 
sauce as soon as it begins to boil. Allow it to cook slowly for five 
minutes, add the salt and sage. When the macaroni is cooked and 
drained, stir it into the sauce, and heat all together.

BREADS 



YEAST BREAD, OR FERMENTED BREAD 

Let it be remembered that white bread is decidedly lacking in 
sllnlose and mineral salts; that so-called " whole-wheat " bread 
kittle better, because most of the so-called whole-wheat flour con- 
InB only about half the bran and none of the germ of the wheat; in 
bet, a law has been passed making it unlawful to call such flour 
whole-wheat flour, and now modiflcations are added to the names of 
BUch flours. I know of one whole-wheat flour, however, that is the 
vrhole wheat, ground to the fineness of flour, and there may be others 
>n the market. The common Graham flour on the market is a mix- 
ture, and does not contain the germ of the wheat; but there are a 
?ew companies making a " straight-ground " wheat meal that answers 
-o the specifications of Sylvester Graham, Bread made from such 
lonr as this is a true " staff of life." 

If bread were made by mixing fiour and water together, and then 
:>aking it in the form of a loaf, the result would be something solid, 
lard to masticate, and unpalatable. For this reason a gas is pro- 
duced in thUkdough, filling it full of holes and making the bread 
light. This gas is produced in the dough by yeast. Yeast cells are 
everywhere j)resent in the air. Yeast is a low form of plant life. 
Ct is this that causes cooked fruit, for example, or fruit juice, when 
exposed to the air, to. " spoil," or ferment. Yeast is closely allied to 
mold. It is yeast that is used in making beer, to cause it to ferment. 
When the beer ferments, the sugar in the mixture is broken up into 
Eilcohol and carbonic acid gas, and a froth rises to the top of the 
Fermenting liquid. This froth is rich in yeast cells. 

The manufacturers of yeast cakes have a method of purifying this 
yeast and getting it into compressed form. In this form especially, 
when dried, the yeast may lie dormant for a considerable time; but 
whenever it is put into a liquid that contains sugar, or starch that 
the yeast can turn to sugar, the yeast starts fermentation if the liquid 
is at a favorable temperature. The yeast cell manufactures sub- 
stances called " ferments," which induce the change from starch to 
sugar, then to alcohol and carbonic acid gas. If fermentation con- 
tinues long enough, acetic acid, or vinegar, is produced from the 
alcohol. The temperature most favorable to fermentation is from 
75° to 80° F. As the temperature lowers, the rapidity of fermen- 
tation decreases; and as the temperature rises, the rapidity of fer- 
mentation increases until a temperature is reached at which the heat 
kills the yeast. 



BREADSi 45 

^ is best to have the temperature in which bread is set to rise 
^low 70° nor above 90° F. If it is desired to hasten the rising 
^^'ead, it is better to use more yeast than to increase the tem- 
ature above 90° F. The carbonic acid gas produced in dough by 
9&t, makes the bread rise; then when the risen dough is baked, 
e result is light bread. If the fermenting process is allowed to 
ntinue too long in the dough, acetic acid is produced, and the bread 
sour. 

Good bread is palatable, light, porous, and crumbly, that is, when 
bbed between the fingers it crumbles instead of rolling into a sticky 
II; also it contains no injurious ingredients, and has not the least 
Dt of sourness. 
It is easier to control the process of bread making and to knead 

bread thoroughly if only a small quantity of dough is made. For 
i reason I will give directions for making one loaf each of white 
ad, whole-wheat bread, and Graham bread, for beginners to prac- 

with. I will also give recipes for larger quantities of bread, to 
used after the process has been mastered and skill has been 
uired. I give the quantity of flour by weight so that when the 
pe is followed exactly, the dough will be of just the right con- 
ency, and a beginner can see and feel just how stiff bread dough 
ht to be. Measuring the fiour is not sufficiently accurate to insure 
ough of the proper consistency. A quart of sifted flour usually 
ghs less than one pound. If it is necessary to measure the flour, 

it, then dip it into the quart measure, and tap the measure 
3ral times to cause the flour to settle and not be so light that 

quart will weigh less than one pound. When very lightly meas- 
d, one quart of sifted flour will not weigh more than twelve or 
rteen ounces. 
A large amount of yeast is called for in these recipes to shorten 

time required for completing the process of making the bread, 
s makes it more convenient for the beginner to watch the whole 
cess. 

RECIPES 

White Bread (one loaf) 

To be baked in a pan 9^^* by i^i by 3 inches, or a pan of equal 
acity. 

1 pound best bread flour, sifted 

1 cup and 1 tablespoon lukewarm water

is entirely dissolved. Then stir in the sugar, salt, and oil. Turn 
this mixture into the flour, and stir it to a dough with a spoon. Then 
take the dough out onto a bread board, and knead till it is perfectly 
smooth. 

This recipe should make a dough stiff enough so that it will not 
be necessary to use flour on the board to knead the dough. The 
purpose of the kneading is to blend thoroughly all the ingredients, 
thus making the dough of a uniform consistency throughout, and 
to develop the elasticity of the gluten, not to make the dough stiffer. 
The process of kneading is a rolling motion which does not require 
much pressure upon the dough. The dough is drawn toward the 
body with the flnger tips, then rolled away from the body with the 
heels of the hands, with light pressure. The dough is prevented 
from sticking to the board by being kept in motion. Care should 
be taken not to exert sufficient force to break the film on the outside 
of the dough. The process should be continued till the surface of 
the dough looks smooth, no lumps or uneven places showing. I find 
that the best grain is produced in bread by giving the dough a v«7 
thorough kneading when it is first mixed, then not kneading it at 
all after that. 

When the dough is sufficiently kneaded, oil the bowl in which it 
was mixed, if this is large enough to let it rise in; put the dough in 
the bowl, and set it in a warm place to rise. Cover the dough tightly 
with a tin cover or with several thicknesses of cloth to prevent a 
skin from forming over the surface of the dough. (When a larger 
quantity of bread is made, it is well to divide the dough into several 
small pieces and thoroughly knead each piece, then put the dough 
all together to rise. In this way it is possible to give the dough a 
more thorough kneading.) This dough should rise enough to more 
than double its bulk. This will require from two to three hours, 
according to the temperature of the place in which it is set to rise.! 

To determine when it has risen enough, give the top of the dough 
a good hard tap with the back of the fingers. If a hole stubbornly 
sinks into the dough where it was struck, it has risen enough. If it 
remains firm after the blow, it should be allowed to rise more. (K 
the dough sinks very quickly when struck, it has been allowed to rise 
too much, that is, more than it should to produce the best bread.) 

When the dough is sufficiently light, take it out on a bread board, 
give it two or three blows with the fist, fingers downward, to flatten 
it out, fold the right and left sides of the dough in toward the cen- 
ter enough to make the sides overlap a little; then, beginning at the 
end farthest from you. roll the dough up into a hard, tight roll. Place 
the roll in the oiled bread tin, and set it in a warm place to TiaUt 
covering it with two or three thicknesses of cloth. It may requin 
an hour, more or less, to rise. When the dough has risen so that Iti 
highest part is one-fourth inch above the top of the pan, it should 
Ife put into the oven. 



BREADS 47 

When risen sufficiently in the loaf, the dough will respond slowly 
when gently pressed with the finger. When it responds quickly, it 
should be allowed to rise more. It is well to know this test so that 
if one does not know that she has the right amount in the pan to fill 
the pan when properly risen, she can tell by this test when the 
dough is properly risen. In this recipe the amount of dough made 
fits the size of the pan indicated. 

If a loaf is ever allowed to rise too much, it is better to take it 
out on a board and mold it over into a tight roll to rise again. The 
grain of the bread will be much better than if it is baked when risen 
too high. 

The oven should be hot for baking bread. If it is desired to test 

the temperature of the oven, place a piece of white paper in the oven. 

If the paper turns dark brown in five minutes, the oven is of the 

right temperature; if it burns, the oven is too hot; if it is only light 

brown, the oven should be made hotter. The oven should be of such 

a temperature that the bread will have a nice brown crust on all 

sides after one hour's baking. When sufficiently baked, bread gives 

a hollow sound when tapped on the top with the fingers, and a well- 

biaked loaf can be held for a moment upon the bare hand without 

burning. Place the loaf on a bread rack to cool, or across the empty 

bread pan, so that air can circulate all around it. 

Whole-Wheat Bread (one loaf) 

1 pound sifted whole-wheat flour 

IVi cups lukewarm water 

1 cake compressed yeast 

1% teaspoons salt 

1 tablespoon sugar 

3 tablespoons cooking oil 

Follow the directions for making white bread. 

Graham Bread (one loaf) 

This recipe is to be used with a Graham flour or wheat meal that 
is made by simply grinding whole wheat, nothing being removed from 
or added to the meal after grinding. This recipe will not make good 
bread with ordinary. Graham flour. 

1 pound Graham flour that is a real wheat meal 

1 cup lukewarm water 

1 cake compressed yeast 

1^ teaspoons salt 

3 tablespoons molasses 

3 tablespoons cooking oil 

Sift the flour to make it light and break up the lumps. Do not 
throw away the bran. This bread is to contain all the wheat, includ- 
ing the bran and germ of the wheat. Look over the bran that re- 
mains in the sifter to be sure that there is nothing in it lYv^^l ^VvwvV^

not go into the bread. Then mix the bran with the flour that hs^ 
been sifted. Crumble the yeast cake Into the lukewarm water, aU^ 
stir till it is completely dissolved. Then stir in the salt, molgisaeB, 
and oil. Turn this mixture into the flour, and stir it to a dough witl* 
a spoon. It should be too soft to knead. Cover it tightly with atiii 
cover or several thicknesses of cloth. Set it in a warm place to rise 
till a hole will sink in the dough when it is struck wilh the backs of 
the fingers. Then take the dough out on a floured board, and mold 
it into a hard roll, according to the instructions given in the direc- 
tions for making white bread. Place the roll in an oiled bread tin 
and set it in a warm place to rise, covered with cloth. When the top 
of the loaf is a little below the top of the pan, it is ready to put into 
the oven. The oven should not be quite so hot for baking this bread 
as for baking white bread, because thjs bread Is more likely to scorch 
on account of the molasses it contains. 

To make this bread without molasses use the following recipe: 

1 pound Graham flour that is real wheat meal 

1 cup and 2 tablespoons lukewarm water 

1 cake compressed yeast 

1^2 teaspoons salt 

3 tablespoons cooking oil 

3 teaspoons sugar 

If ordinary Graham flour must be used in making Graham bread, 
follow the recipe for making white bread, using one-half pound white 
flour and one-half pound Graham flour; or a smaller proportion of 
Graham is sometimes used. Sift the Graham flour, but do not throw 
away the bran; use the bran in the bread. 

In making a larger quantity of bread, it is not necessary to use 
an equally large proportion of yeast. One yeast cake may be used 
with three or four times the amount given in these recipes, but it 
will take longer to make the bread. 

If it is desired that the bread should be lighter, and in this re- 
spect more like baker's bread, when the dough has risen the first 
time punch it down in the middle, and fold in the sides so as to make 
a hard ball. Turn the dough over, and allow it to rise a second time. 
When it has risen the second time, mold it into loaves. 

Walnut Bread 

Use the recipe for whole-wheat bread, putting into the dougl) 
when it is first mixed (that is, mixing them with the flour before the 
liquid is added) three-fourths cup walnut meats, not chopped. 

Fruit Bread 

Use the recipe for whole-wheat bread, putting into the dough 
when it is first mixed one-half cup seedless raisins that have been 
washed an(\ dried.

YEAST BUNS 

To make buns, one may use any of the recipes given for bread. 

Plain Bun» (about one dozen) 

Allow the dough to rise twice, then divide it into one-and-one- 
f-ounce pieces. With the palms of the hands roll each of these 
;es into a round, tight ball on the bread board. Place the balls 
ut one-eighth of an inch apart on an oiled baking pan, and set 
n in a warm place to rise. Allow them to rise lighter than bread 
tllowed to rise, or till, when pressed with the flnger, the dough 
)onds very weakly, if at all. Have the oven a little hotter for 
ing buns than for baking bread.

Paricer House Rolls 

Use either the recipe for one loaf of white bread (page 45) or for 
Sweet Buns (page 49). After the dough is risen the second time, 
mold it into one-and-one-half -ounce balls, laying the balls out on the 
floured bread board. After all the dough is formed into balls, take 
one of them and flatten by pressing it with the palm of the hand, 
then with the edge of the hand make a crease a little to one side of 
the diameter of the roll. Spread the smaller side with a little oil, 
and fold the larger side over the smaller side. Place, small side 
down, on an oiled baking pan, one-fourth inch apart. Set them in 
a warm place to rise. Do not allow them to rise quite so much as 
other rolls or buns. Bake them when they respond slowly to the 
touch. If they rise too much before baking, they will lose their shape.

Make a dough of one quart cold water and three and one-half 
luarts sifted good bread flour. Knead the dough well, then allow 
t to stand in cold water from one-half to one hour. Then put the 
lough into water that feels decidedly warm to the hands. Work 
;he dough with the hands in the water. As the water becomes 
nilky, pour it off, and add fresh warm water. Continue to work the 
lough and pour off the water, pouring on fresh water, till the water 
emains clear. You should theu hav^ otx^ wx^ otift'lw^xXjL ^^\v5^§v^

of pure gluten, a tough, rubbery substance. Drain this gluten well. 
It is suflacient for one loaf of bread. 

Gluten Bread 

1^4 pounds gluten prepared as above 

2 cakes yeast, dissolved in one tablespoon warm water. 

% teaspoon salt 

^A cup oil 

8 ounces bread flour 

Work well till you have a perfectly smooth dough, then set in a 
warm place to rise. When risen, work it down. Allow it to rise 
again, then mold it into a loaf. Set the loaf in a warm place to rise 
till it is one and one-half times its original size. Then bake it one 
hour. 

This bread, if made from flour which is 10 per cent gluten, will 
be about 20 per cent gluten bread; if made from flour which is 12 
per cent gluten, it will be about 24 per cent gluten. (Bread flour is 
usually from 10 to 12 per cent gluten.) Ordinary bread is from 8 
to 10 per cent gluten. A loaf of bread made according to this recipe 
would contain about six ounces of starch, flve and one-half ounces of 
gluten, two ounces of fat, and the rest water. 

Pure Gluten Biscuit 

Take the pure gluten after it has been obtained by washing tho 
starch from the dough, cut it into pieces, and form them into balls 
about the size of small walnuts. Place these pieces on a baking pan, 
and bake in a slow oven till lightly browned. They will puff up and 
become very light. 

Nut Gluten Biscuit 

Mix with the gluten before it is formed into balls, one fourth as 
much chopped almonds as you have gluten. 

Laxative Gluten Biscuit 

Mix with the gluten one eighth as much wheat bran as you have 
gluten. 

UNFERMEN TED BREADS 

Unfermented breads are breads made light without the use of 
yeast. The Passover cakes of the Israelites are an example of such 
breads. The earliest forms of bread were unfermented, and these 
hard breads are, no doubt, the most wholesome, because they compel 
thorough mastication, and because there are no yeast germs in them 
to start fermentation in the stomach. While the t?rm " unfer- 
mented " may be applied to this kind of bread, this term is also 
applied to soft bread which is made light by some other process than 
fermentatioD. 



BREADS 67 

Commonly, soda or baking powder is used to leaven breads in 
'^hich yeast is not used. I will explain briefly why we do not sanc- 
tion the use of soda, baking powder, or other chemicals in the mak- 
ing of bread and cake. Soda is an alkali, somewhat similar to potash 
Or lye, but not so strong. Lye will eat the skin of the hands. Soda 
has a similar effect upon the lining of the stomach, which is not so 
tough as the skin of the hands. If great care is not taken in using 
soda, some of it will be left in the bread not neutralized by the acid 
with which it is used. But even when the soda is carefully propor- 
tioned to the acid, as it is in baking powder, so that no soda is left 
in the bread, there is still an objectionable chemical residue. 

In making biscuit, cream of tartar and soda are used in the pro- 
portion of two and one-fourth level teaspoons of cream of tartar and 
one level teaspoon of soda to one pint of flour. This will leave in 
the biscuit one hundred flfty grains, or two and one-half level tea- 
spoons of Rochelle salt. Rochelle salt, or any other chemical in 
food, is not food, and cannot be used by the body, but is an irritant, 
irritating the lining of the alimentary tract, the blood vessels, and 
the eliminative organs by which it must be elin^inated. Extra and 
useless work is put upon the eliminative organs, especially those 
whose duty it is to take care of poisons and prevent them from 
injuring the body. 

When soda is used with milk, sodium lactate is left in the bread; 
when it is used with vinegar or molasses, the residue is sodium 
acetate; when soda is used with phosphoric acid, as it is in some 
baking powders, phosphate of lime and soda is left in the bread; 
when soda is used with alum, as it is in other baking powders, 
Glauber salt, or sulphate of soda, and aluminum hydrate are left in 
the bread. All these chemical residues interfere more or less with 
digestion and with the life processes of the body, especially in per- 
sons who are not vigorous and who do not live an active outdoor 
life. 

To make breads light without the use of either yeast or chem- 
icals, air is incorporated into batter breads by beating with a batter 
whip, and into dough breads by beating with a mallet or by knead- 
ing. Such breads are sometimes called " aerated breads." 

It should be remembered that these breads depend for lightness 
entirely upon the process of making them. All the ingredients used 
should be as cold as possible.

SOUPS 



Meat soups contain very little nourishment. For the sake of 
comparison we will give the food value of a few liquid foods, the 
figures being based upon tables of food values issued by the United 
States Government: - 

('ALORIES PER OUNCE 

Beef soup 8.0 

Beef broth 4.7 

Beef juice ' 7.5 

Beef tea 0.5 

Milk 20.6 

Pea soup 25.9 

Bean soup , 25.1 

Apples 18.4 

Grape juice 23.8 

Apple juice 17.0 

Pea soup and bean soup, having the above nutritive value, are 
made from peas or beans and water, one pound of pieas or beans 
making two quarts of soup. 

The name '' extract " suggests that beef extracts contain the nour- 
ishment of the meat from which they are made; but the fact is they 
contain only the flavoring matter of the meat, and really consist of 
those substances which are the waste products of the life processes. 
These in due course would have been eliminated by the excretory 
organs of the animal if it had lived. In eating beef soups and broths 
we are only introducing into our systems waste products which must 
be eliminated, and thus extra work is put upon our eliminative 
organs. 

It is an interesting fact that vegetable broths are an antidote 
for such waste products as are in beef tea, as they contain substances 
which help the body to throw off these wastes. And at the same time 
they supply real nourishment. The mineral salts contained in veg- 
etable broths and fruit juices may be called " nature's medicines," 
for it is lack of these that allows the body to succumb to many 
illnesses. 

The mineral matter in vegetables readily dissolves in the water 
in which they are cooked, and this water is too valuable to be thrown 
away. Delicious bouillon can be made by simply mixing together 
the water in which different vegetables have been cooked, such as 
string beans, peas, asparagus, spinach, onions, cabba^^, \A\SiAb X^^i^xi^^.. 



62 GOOD FOOD 

potatoes, baked peanuts. To the water a little strained tomato may 
be added, and a little thyme or summer savory may be used for 
seasoning. 

There are on the market vegetable extracts, put up in the same 
form as beef extracts, and vegetable bouillon cubes, which so closely 
resemble meat extract in chemical composition and flavor as almost 
to deceive one into the belief that they contain meat extract. These 
may be used in flavoring vegetable broths. 

We might divide soups into four classes; namely, broths, or thin 
soups; vegetable and tomato soups; cream soups; and legume soups. 
The last named are the most nutritious. 

A good substitute for chicken broth can be made by using the 
broth from green peas, Lima beans, and baked peanuts. Protose 
broth may be used instead of the broth from peanuts. 

Bean Broth 

Thoroughly wash one pint of pea beans, and put them to cook in 
two quarts or more of cold water. Bring them to a boil slowly, and 
simmer gently for several hours, adding boiling water if necessary, 
till the water in which the beans are cooking becomes rich. Drain 
off the water, of which there should be not much more than one pint, 
season with salt, and it is ready to serve. A few grains of thyme 
also may be used for seasoning. 

When properly made, this broth is so rich that when it is cold it 
is jellylike in consistency. It is a nutritious and digestible food for 
persons who must take a liquid diet. 

The beans which are left may be made into a pur6e, and sea- 
soned with salt and cream or vegetable oil or butter substitute; or 
they may be seasoned with salt and two or three tablespoons of oil, 
and baked in a pan in the oven till nicely browned on top. 

Split pea broth is made in a similar manner, and is even more 
delicious than the bean broth. 

Bran Broth 

Bran contains valuable mineral salts of which people deprive 
themselves when their diet consists largely of white-flour products. 
Bran broth is valuable for supplying these substances. 

1 cup wheat bran 

1 slice of onion 

1 small stalk of celery, chopped 

1 small carrot, chopped 

A few drops of caramel 

Put all except the caramel to cook in one quart of cold water, 
and simmer slowly till there is about one pint of broth left. Strain 
through cheesecloth. Add salt and caramel, reheat, and serve. 



SOUPS «s 

Caramel is valuable to keep on hand for coloring and flavoring 
Bonps, gravies, custards, and pudding sauces. It is made as follows: 

Caramd 

Put one cup sugar to cook in one-fourth cup water over a hot 
fire. Keep it boiling, watching it closely, until it has turned a dark- 
brown color, has a caramel odor, and looks almost as if it is scorch- 
ing, but be careful not to scorch it. Have a little boiling water ready, 
and when the sugar has reached the right point, pour the water into 
the caramel, being careful that it does not spatter on you. The water 
will harden some of the caramel. Allow it to cook till the caramel 
dissolves. It should then be an almost black liquid, and is ready for 
use. It may be put into a bottle and will keep indefinitely. 

Spinach or Asparaffiis Cream Broth 

Season with cream and salt, the water in which spinach or aspara- 
^s has been cooked. Serve hot. 

The spinach water should not be too strong, or it will not be 
palatable. It should be diluted with water till it has a mild flavor, 
lust a little spinach water added to gravies or to vegetable soups 
s;ives them a meaty flavor. 

Both spinach water and asparagus water are too valuable to be 
thrown away. 

Vegetable Broth 

This broth is especially valuable for its mineral content, and 
^ill help to maintain the alkalinity of the blood and the vitality of 
the body. 

1 pint finely chopped celery 

1 pint finely chopped carrots 

l^ pint finely chopped turnips 

^ pint finely chopped onions 

'^^ pint tomatoes 

4 sprigs parsley 

1% quarts cold water 

Put the vegetables to cook in the cold water, and heat them 
gradually till just below the boiling point. Keep them at this tem- 
perature for about four hours. This may be accomplished by cook- 
ing in a double boiler. Cooked in this way, no odors are given off, 
and therefore nothing is lost. Drain off the water. This broth may 
be served simply with the addition of salt, or cream may be added, 
which will increase both its palatability and its nutritive value. 

This recipe is only an example. Other combinations of vege- 
tables may be used, adding to them an equal bulk of cold water after 
they are chopped, and proceeding according to directions for this 
recipe. When beets are used with other vegetables, a broth can be 
made that resembles prune juice in flavor.

The following method seems to me to be a great improvement 
over the usual method of making cream celery, cream lettuce, cream 
cucumber, and cream corn soups. Stewing lettuce, celery, or cu-

Put it to cook in one pint of cold water. Cook slowly till tender. 
Rub half of the oyster through a colander. Then put the water In 
which the oyster was cooked, the diced oyster and the oyster pulp, 
and the milk, or milk and cream, all together in a double boiler. If 
the ingredients do not make one quart, add water to make one quart.

LEGUMES 



Legumes Is a name given to the bean ramlly, which include! 
various kinds of beans, peas, lentils, and peanuts. The name 
" pulse " is also applied to this class of food substances. Legumes 
differ from other vegetable foods Id that they contain a much larger 
proportion of protein, the nitrogenous food principle, which Is the 
building material, the food substance which composes lean meat. In 
fact, dried legumes contain a larger proportion of this body-building 
material than any other food, not excepting meat. 

The nitrogenous substance of legumes is called " legumln." Its 
resemblance to the casein of milk enables the Chinese to make cheese 
from beans. 

Peas and lentils are more easily digested than beans. Beans 
have a bad reputation, a reputation lor being 'proverbially hard to 
digest, so much so that only persons who are doing the most vigor- 
ous muscular work are supposed to be able to digest them. There 




are three reasons for this reputation: First, beans are almost always 
Insufficiently cooked; second, they are often Improperly masticated, 
leaving the skin which covers them tough and unbroken, in which 
state it Is likely to Interfere with digestion; third, the large amount 
of pork fat usually cooked with them renders them indigestible. 
These facta give us the key to the proper cooking and eating of 
legumes. 

The tendency of beans to produce flatulence may be partly due to 
the tough hulls where the beans are Improperly cooked and Improp- 
erly masticated, and partly to the fact that beans are rich In aulpbnr. 
which gives rise to eulphureted hydrogen gas. Peas contain leu 
sulphur than beans, and lentils still less. The objectlonalile bolU

LEGUMES 73 

may be sifted out or pulverized by putting the legumes through a 
colander, thus making a pur6e of them; if dry enough, they may be 
baked in the form of a loaf. The legumes are also rich In iron. 

Many cooks believe it is necessary to add soda to beans, to re- 
move some poison or to cause the beans to cook more quickly. A 
reasonable excuse for using soda can be given only when hard water 
is used for cooking them. Hard water contains salts of lime, and 
the legumin of beans is able to unite with It to form an insoluble 
compound. Therefore it is not possible to cook beans properly in 
hard water. The addition of a little soda to the water precipitates 
the lime, and makes it possible to cook the beans in hard water, 
but it is far better to use soft water for cooking beans. Rain water 
is best. 

The following table gives the food value of the dry legumes. As 
we eat them cooked, as stewed beans, peas, or lentils, their food 
value is only about one third as much, and the addition of a little fat 
of some kind for seasoning will make the proportion of fat a little 
higher.

THE COOKING OF LEGUMES 

From what has already been said about legumes we learn: (1) 
That to prepare them properly for the table they require long, slow 
cooking in soft water, so as to soften all the cellulose which they 
contain; (2) that a wholesome, easily digested fat should be used 
with them; and (3) that, when eaten, they should be thoroughly 
masticated. The legumes, with the exception of the soy bean and 
the peanut, being deficient in fat, really need the addition of some 
kind of fat to make them a' well-balanced food. 

Since one of the objects to be attained in the cooking of the 
legumes is to bring them back as nearly as po^^WA^ \.o XXil^Vc ^^^'

dition before they were dried, they should be soaked in cold water, 
that they may absorb as much water as possible before they are put 
to cook. 

stewed Beans 

Thoroughly wash one pint of beans. Soak them overnight, then 
drain off the water in which they were soaked, and put them to cook 
in fresh cold water. Bring them to a boil slowly, after which allow 
them to cook slowly from three to five hours, according to the age 
of the beans. Add 2% teaspoons of salt and a little cream or two 
tablespoons of vegetable oil or butter substitute. 

The parboiling of beans is unnecessary so far as wholesomeness 
is concerned. Some persons prefer to parboil them to remove some 
of their strong bean flavor, which they find objectionable. 

Salt should not be added to beans till they are done, as it hard- 
ens the beans and hinders the cooking process. 

Bean Puree 

Allow the beans to cook down dry at the last, then rub through 
a pur^e sieve. Season with salt and rich cream or other fat. 

This pur6e may be pressed into an oiled bread tin and baked, 
when it may be sliced and served with chili sauce, mint sauce, or 
gravy. 

Ribbon Beans 

Make dry pur^e of white beans and of kidney or black beans. 
Season well with salt and rich cream, or a vegetable fat, and press 
in alternate layers In an oiled tin. Bake, slice, and serve with mint 
*»auce. 

Bean Patties 

Seasoned bean pur^e may be shaped into patties, baked in a quick 
oven, and served on creamed macaroni or with chili sauce or tomato 
cream sauce or peanut-butter gravy.

1 tablespoon molasses 

2 tablespoons cooking oil 

Wash the beans and soak them overnight. In the morning drain 
off the water and put them into a bean pot. Add the remaining in- 
gredients, and sufficient boiling water to cover them. Cover the pot 
and bake them in a moderate oven for twelve hours or longer, adding 
boiling water when necessary. 



LEGUMES 75 

Parboiling is unnecessary, but is generally done. The beans will 
be better if they are baked twelve or even twenty-four hours, but 
the heat of the oven must be moderate. 

Other pea beans than the California may be used. Sugar may be 
substituted for the molasses, but the molasses is necessary to give 
the real Boston baked-bean flavor. 

One pint or less of strained tomatoes may be used in place of 
part of the water with which the beans are covered when put to 
bake. 

Baked Beans — No. 2 

Some people prefer to season the beans, after parboiling, with 
oil and salt, omitting the molasses, or using sugar, and then place 
them in a shallow baking pan, cover with hot water, and bake for 
three or four hours, adding boiling water as necessary, having the 
top nicely browned when the beans are done. 

Peas 

Peas may be prepared according to all the recipes given for cook- 
ing beans. They even make an excellent dish baked according to 
the recipe for baked beans. 

Pea Cutlets with Nut Crumbs 

When you have some left-ov^r peas pur^e, pack it in an oiled 
bread tin. The next day it may be removed from the pan and sliced. 
Dip the slices in a mixture of one egg and one tablespoon of water, 
beaten together, then roll them in chopped English walnuts. Place 
them on ah oiled pan, and bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a hot 
oven. Serve with tomato cream sauce. 

Baked Split Peas 

Wash well one pint of green split peas, and soak them overnight. 
In the morning put them into a double boiler and cook till tender. 
They will get tender almost as quickly in a double boiler as -if cooked 
directly over the stove, and there is no danger of scorching them. 
Add to them 2% teaspoons salt, one half cup rich cream or one fourth 
cup vegetable oil. Put them into a baking pan in which they will 
be about two inches deep, with water enough to cover them. Bake 
slowly for one hour or more, till they are thoroughly tender and dry 
and mealy. Serve with cream sauce or tomato sauce. 

^^ Lentils 

Lentils have a stronger flavor than peas or beans, which is not 
generally liked till one has become accustomed to it. But they can 
be made into dishes having a more meaty flavor than the other leg- 
umes. They contain more protein. Their hulls are tough, and while 
the lentils may be cooked in all the ways in which beans are cooked, 
they are better if made into soup, pur§e, or patU^s — ^otcl^ \wtb. \w

NUTS 



If fruits are the " queens among foods," it seems to me that nuts 
ire the kings. Most nuts are really fruits or parts (seeds) of 
truits, though they are quite different from those products which we 
are accustomed to think of as fruits. They are the hard fruits. 

Nuts may well form a substantial part of the diet, and that is 
the way they ought to be used. They are rich in fat and protein, 
and contain, with the exception of the chestnut and the peanut, very 
little or no starch. They are, next to pure fats, the most concen- 
trated of all foods. They must not be used as the main food supply, 
but merely as an accompaniment of other more bulky foods. If 
we think of them as butter substitutes rather than meat substitutes, 
— and they, with legumes, can well supply the place of both meat 
and butter, — we shall approach more nearly to a proper use of them, 
for no one would think of making butter a main article of diet. 
Nuts are nature's meat and butter, and they do not have to be kept 
In cold storage. Nature herself has sealed up their nourishment 
against the action of the elements. 

All nuts, except chestnuts, being rich in protein and fat, may 
be used as meat substitutes and eaten with carbohydrate foods, as 
bread, potatoes, and fruit, and the less concentrated foods, as green 
(vegetables; while chestnuts, which resemble bread in their compo- 
sition, may be eaten as a vegetable and in combination with. milk, 
;ream, eggs, or other nuts. 

Nuts have a reputation for indigestibility second to nothing but 
-ich pies and puddings, and they are able to sustain this reputation 
Ls they are usually eaten — not well masticated, eaten between meals 
)r late at night or after a hearty meal. But when reduced to a 
inely divided state, either before or during mastication, and eaten 
n reasonable quantities and at proper times, their digestibility has 
>een proved to compare very favorably with that of other common 
!oods, as bread and milk. The fat of nuts eaten thus is one of the 
nost easily digested forms of fat; being in an emulsified state, it 
cannot smear the walls of the stomach nor other foods, thus inter- 
fering with their digestion. There seems to be no foundation for 
:he common belief that salt aids the digestion of nuts, or prevents 
iny distress from eating them. It may, according to the taste of 
some people, add to their palatability. 

Nuts, with the exception of peanuts and chestnuts, require no 
cooking. As with strawberries, cooking impairs tiieVx ^^WcaX^^v^ot^. 



78 OOOD FOOD 

The manufactured nut foods which are on the market may m ^^ke 
a valuable addition to the diet from the standpoint of palatabl '^ity 
and variety, but are more expensive than homemade nut pr^j)a- 
rations. 

It takes only half an ounce of nuts, which would be three Bretzil- 
nut meats, eight pecan meats, three walnut meats, or fourteen 
blanched almonds, to equal one hundred food units of steak, or a 
small piece of steak.

Gluten Stew 
TO OBTAIN THE GLUTEN 

Make a dough of one pint of cold water and one and three-fourths

stand in cold water one-half hour. Then work the dough with 

hands in the cold water, and the starch will wash out. As the 
;er becomes milky, pour it off, being careful not to lose any of 

gluten, then add fresh cold water. Continue to work the dough 
I pour off the water till the water remains clear. You then have 
amp of gluten. Cut this gluten into pieces the size of a small

MILK PRODUCTS 

We are sometimes asked why we use milk, which is an animal 
product, while we do not use meat. In answer, we would say that 
milk does not contain the waste products of broken-down tissue which 
are produced by the life and activity of the animal, and which con- 
stitute a great objection to the use of meat as food. Milk was made 
to be eaten, and it is the natural food of young animals; but the 
animals themselves, we believe, were not made to be eaten. Cow's 
milk is the natural food of calves, but not the natural food of 
babies; hence it has to be modified to be made into a good food for 
them. It is not a natural food for adults, though many find that 
it agrees with them very well; and in the form of soured milk, it 
may be regarded as a valuable food, the lactic acid seeming to 
exercise a restraining influence upon putrefactive processes in the 
intestines. 

Of course, milk should be obtained from healthy cows, and be 
handled in a sanitary manner; otherwise it will contain disease 
germs, and be open to nearly the same objections as diseased meat. 
In fact, milk from diseased animals, or milk handled in an insan- 
itary manner, is positively dangerous; for it readily conveys the 
germs of tuberuclosis, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and typhoid fever. 

VALUE OF MILK AS A FOOD 

Because it is practically impossible to obtain milk that is clean 
and pure and produced by healthy cows, we cannot esteem milk, 
cream, and butter so highly as we do the foods from the vegetable 
kingdom, which we have been studying; namely, the fruits, grains, 
nuts, and vegetables. " As disease in animals increases, the use of 
milk . . . will become more and more unsafe." — " The Ministry 
of Healing,'* p. 320. And yet milk is of very great importance in 
the diet, on account of the growth-promoting vitamine that it con- 
tains, which is absolutely essential to health and which is lacking 
in meat and most common foods. The principal other foods that 
contain this vitamine are green leaves, such as lettuce, cress, and 
parsley. 

Milk is also valuable for supplying mineral salts, especially lime, 
and also because all its food constituents are so easily . digested 
and assimilated. 

Another fact in favor of milk is that it is not kept in cold 
storage, as meat is, till its protein element is far advanced in decay 
before it is considered fit to eat.

By referring to the above table, giving the nutritive value of milk, 
we see that half that value is fat and nearly one fifth is protein. 
Remembering that only one tenth of our food needs to be protein, 
we see that milk is one of the foods that may be used to supply the 
place of meat, and should be used with foods that contain more 
carbohydrate. Thus we see that the custom of eating bread with 
milk, which experience has taught us is right, is right scientifically 
also. With the exception of legumes, skim milk is the cheapest 
source of protein. It might with advantage be used more than it Is 
in the diet of persons to whom economy is important. 

The carbohydrate of milk is milk sugar, the least sweet and one 
of the most easily digested of sugars. 

Milk is really water holding in solution a little mineral matter, 
sugar, and albumin, and having suspended in it little globules of fat, 
each held in a minute sack made of casein. These little sacks of 
fat, being lighter than the surrounding liquid, rise to the top in the 
form of cream. 

DlGESTmnuITY OF MILK 

Milk is generally thought of as a liquid food, but it is liquid only 
when sweet. In the stomach it soon curdles. If it were regarded 
as a food, and were eaten instead of drunk, it would digest with much 
less difficulty. The calf and the child get their milk in a fine stream. 
It would be much better for other users of milk if they would take 
it in a similar way, as through a straw. When swallowed in large 
gulps, it forms large, hard curds in the stomach, which the digestive 
juices have difficulty in dissolving. And we shall see that it would 
be even better to allow it to become solid, as in the preparation of 
artificially soured milk, and eat it with a spoon. Sour milk is com- 
monly thought to be spoiled milk, but milk which has simply turned 
sour is a better food than sweet milk. 

Regarding milk as a beverage instead of as a food has a tendency 
to lead to its use after a sufficiency of other food has been taken. 
This may be the reason why some who use it find it indigestible. 
When milk Is taken with bread, as in eating bread and milk, tbe 



MILK PRODUCTS 95 

milk cannot form large, hard curds in the stomach, and persons 
often find they can take It in this combination when if taken alone 
it disagrees. Of course, in eating bread and milk care should be 
taken to masticate the bread sufficiently. 

Milk is thickened, or coagulated, by acid and by rennet. Cheese 
is the casein of milk coagulated by rennet and separated from the 
whey. When first made, it is tough and tasteless. A process of de- 
composition must go on in it to render it tender and to develop flavor 
(it must be allowed to ripen), to make it ''palatable"! There are 
certain bacteria which produce certain flavors in cheese, and these 
different flavored cheeses have been given names according to their 
flavors. In Europe, where cheese making has been reduced to a 
science, any desired kind of cheese is made by introducing into the 
curd when flrst made the bacteria which produce that particular 
kind of cheese. 

When milk sours, the sugar of the milk is turned to lactic acid 
by the lactic acid bacillus, which is always present in milk. The 
growth of this germ is encouraged by warmth and electrical condi- 
tions of the atmosphere. This lactic acid causes the milk to coagu- 
late. Other acids added to milk will produce the same result. The 
curd formed in this way is made into cottage cheese. The acid gives 
to this cheese, when fresh, an agreeable flavor. It is therefore used 
soon after making, and is a wholesome food. 

CARE OF MnjK: 

Milk should be kept in glassware, earthenware, aluminumware, 
or graniteware vessels, not in dishes made of metal upon which any 
acid formed in the milk might act. Milk readily takes up germs 
and absorbs odors. It should therefore not be allowed to stand un- 
covered, nor to remain near anything having a strong odor. And it 
should be kept at as low a temperature as possible. But milk should 
not be 80 tightly covered as to exclude air, for the absence of air 
favors the growth of putrefactive germs. Several layers of cheese- 
cloth may be used as a cover. In fact, it is impossible to be too 
careful in the care of milk and of the dishes in which it is kept. All 
dishes that have contained milk should be thoroughly cleaned before 
milk is again put into them, for just a little of the old milk will 
cause the new to sour. 

In washing milk dishes, rinse them in cold water before putting 
them into hot water, for hot water used flrst would harden the 
albumin and cause it to adhere to the dish, especially in the corners 
and seams. After washing in soapsuds, or water in which washing 
soda has been dissolved, rinse thoroughly to remove all the soap. 
It is well then to place them where the air and the direct rays of 
the sun will have free access to them. 

Cream, of course, contains a larger amount of fat than does milk, 
its richness depending upon the proportion of fat. Based upon the

I 



figures in the Government bulletin, the food value of cream in cal- 
ories per ounce is as follows: 

Protein Fat Carbo. Total 

2.9 48.9 5.2 57.0 

The fat in milk and cream is in a very finely divided or emulsified 
state, for which reason it is one of the most easily digested forms 
of fat ^ 

STERILIZATION OF MELK 

Unless it is absolutely certain that milk is obtained from per- 
fectly healthy cows and is handled in the most sanitary manner, it is 
unsafe to use it without first sterilizing it. It is certainly far better 
to use only milk from healthy cows, protected in a sanitary manner. 

Sterilizing produces some change in milk by reason of which it 
may be the cause of scurvy in children to whom it is fed. Children 
who must be fed upon sterilized milk may be kept from having 
scurvy by giving them a little orange juice between the feedings 
of milk. Pasteurization is generally recommended instead of steri- 
lization. 

There are persons who find hot milk more easily digested than 
cold, perhaps on account of the stimulating effect of the heat upon 
the stomach. Hot milk should be taken slowly, 'in very small sips. 

ARTIP1CIAL.L.Y PREPARED BUTTERMILK 

Buttermilk has long been recognized as a wholesome food. How- 
ever, it is deprived of the fat of the milk; and from the fact that the 
milk may have been old and germ-laden before the butter was made, 
the buttermilk may not be of the cleanest or most wholesome nature. 
By making use of the germ which causes the souring of milk, an 
artificially prepared buttermilk may be made which is free from 
harmful germs, and which contains all the food constituents of the 
milk. There are various brands of buttermilk tablets on the market 
for use in preparing this milk. 

In this sour-milk preparation the casein of the milk is in the form 
of fine, fiaky curds, which are very easily acted upon by the digestive 
fluids. It cannot form large, hard curds in the stomach. 

RECIPES 

To Pasteurize MUk 

To Pasteurize milk a thermometer is necessary. Heat the milk 
quickly in a double boiler to 140° F., and keep it at that temperature 
for twenty or thirty minutes, then cool it quickly. Milk treated in 
this manner will not cause scurvy, and its flavor is not altered. 



MILK PRODUCTS^ 97 

To Sterilise Milk 

To sterilize milk, heat it quickly in a double boiler, and keep it 
at the boiling point for fifteen or twenty minutes, then cool it 
quickly; or put bottles of milk which have stoppers of sterile cotton, 
in a kettle of cold water, heat to boiling, and keep at the boiling 
point for fifteen or twenty minutes, then cool quickly. Care should 
be taken to place something under the bottles to prevent their resting 
on the bottom of the kettle. 

Yorurt "Buttermilk" 

Pulverize two yogurt tablets and dissolve them in a little cold 
water. Sterilize one quart of milk, and cool it to 110° F. Add a 
few grains of salt and the dissolved tablets. Stir well. Set in a 
warm place where it can be kept at 110° F., from 12 to 24 hours. 
At the end of that time — possibly it might be a little longer or a 
little shorter — it will be thickened. Set it in the refrigerator. 
When cold, whip it with a batter whip till it is creamy. 

When more is required, it is not necessary to use another tablet. 
One-fourth cup of this prepared milk is sufficient to make one gallon 
of yogurt. Proceed as in making the first quart, using the one-fourth 
cup of prepared milk in place of the tablet. It will probably not be 
necessary to allow it to stand much more than four to eight hours 
when made in this way. The new lot should not be prepared from 
the old milk more than three or four times in succession, because 
other germs are sure to get in, which may cause trouble in prop- 
erly preparing it. Yogurt should not be allowed to Stand too long 
in a warm place. If it does, the whey may separate from the curd, 
and the result will be a thin, watery milk instead of a thick, creamy 
substance. Just as soon as the milk thickens, it should be put into 
a cold place. 

This " buttermilk " may be prepared from skim milk, but it will 
not be so thick and rich as when prepared from whole milk. 

Cottaffe Cheese 

The best of cottage cheese may be made from milk prepared ac- 
cording to the foregoing directions. The soured milk should be pre- 
pared in a shallow pan. With a knife cut the lobbered milk into 
two-inch cubes. Set the pan in a moderate oven, and heat the milk 
to just a little above lukewarm. Heating it too hot will make the 
cheese tough, and you will get less cheese. Do not stir the milk. 
This also will lessen the quantity of cheese. When the whey has 
separated, pour the milk into a cheesecloth bag, and hang up to 
drain. Remove from the bag and season with salt and cream. The 
cheese may be formed into balls or cakes if desired. 

Cottage cheese may be made from ordinary sour milk by the 
same process. Soured skim milk may be used.

The most convenient way to whip cream is to put it into a talf, 
narrow pitcher or tin can just large enough to allow the egg beater 
to revolve In it. Have the cream cold. Add flavoring, and sugar in 
the proportion of one level tablespoon to one cup of cream, Beai 
till the cream thickene, but do not exjiect It to become as thick as 
butter, because it will begin to turn to butter before it becomes as 
thick as that. Stop whipping while the cream is stilt smooth. It 
beaten loo long, it will curdle and look rough. 

JunkEl 

Junket is prepared by coagulating milk with rennet. Rennet is 
a digeative principle obtained from the lining of a calf's stomach. 
The same ferment is secreted by the human stomach, and whenever 
sweet milk is taken into the stomach, it is very soon turned to 
junket. Junket tablets may be obtained at any druggist's and at 
many grocers'. To prepare junket use the following formula: 

To one quart milk add one-fourth cup sugar, a few grains salt, 
and a little lemon or vanilla flavoring. Heat until lukewarm. Jun- 
ket cannot be prepared from sterilized milk. Add one Junket tablet, 
which has been dis8olved"-ln one tablespoon cold water, turn into 
custard cups at once, and allow to remain in a warm place without 
(disturbing till set, which will tahe but a tew minutes. Then set 
away In a cold place. If allowed to remain warm too long, it may 
sour or the whey may separate. This makes a simple and whole- 
some dessert. ' It is very digestible, because the casein is coagulated 
into a soft curd, and it cannot form large, hard curds in the stomach.

EGGS 



We are sometimes asked why we eat eggs, but do not eat chicken. 
We believe that the only eggs fit to be used are strictly fresh ones, 
laid by hen» that are fed upon wholesome food, and not upon filth 
and garbage. Eggs have .not been alive, and so do not contain the 
waste products of life; and if they have been produced under the 
conditions named, they contain neither disease germs nor the poison- 
ous products of decomposition. But when we consider the difficulty 
of obtaining such eggs, we must regard ordinary eggs as a more 
questionable source of nourishment than fruits, nuts, grains, and 
vegetables.

most concentrated forms of nitrogenous food, containing considerabl 
fat also. They rank next to meat in this respect. In fact, 
closely resemble meat in nutritive value, being richer in fat an<f 
poorer in protein than medium fat meat. This places them among 
the numerous substitutes for meat. But let us not forget that nuts 
are much higher in nutritive value than any other food except the 
oils and fats. 

These figures show that the white of egg is almost pure albumen, 
one form of protein, or nitrogenous, food containing very little fat; 
while the yolk is rich in fat. The white consists of a solution of 
albumen incased in minute sacks, or cells. When the white is beaten, 
the sacks are broken, and the albumen, being viscous, or sticky, 
catches air, and increases to many times its bulk when unbeaten. 
The beating makes the white of the egg a little more digestible, 
because the sacks are a slight hindrance to the digestion of their 
contents. 

The yolk of the egg contains less water than the white, consider- 
able fat, and a little more nitrogenous matter and mineral matter. 
The fats are in the form of an emulsion, hence very easily digested. 
E}ggs are rich in some of the mineral salts which are most im- 
portant to the body, namely, iron, phosphorus, and lime; and these 
minerals are in organic combination, and prepared for the use of the 
body, while iron and phosphorus in the form of drugs are not so 
organized. Eggs, especially the yolk, are therefore a valuable food 
for anemic and nervous persons, also persons suffering from tuber- 
culosis. But we do not think it advisable to give tuberculosis pa- 
tients such large quantities of eggs that they take a great excess of 
protein. White of egg contains sulphur also, which is the substance 
that discolors silverware. There is no foundation in fact for the 
belief that eggs with dark shells are richer than eggs with light 
shells, for they do not differ in composition. 

Eight or ten eggs are about equal in nutritive value to one pound 
of medium fat meat. Therefore when eggs are cheap, they are a 
cheaper source of nourishment than meat; and when they are mod- 
erate in price, they are about equal to meat in that respect. 



TO DETERMINE THE AGE OP EGGS 

The age of an egg may be determined by placing it in a glass of 
water. If it is fresh, it will lie on its side in the bottom of the 
glass. If it is three weeks old, the large end will be slightly raised. 
If it is three months old, it will stand upright in the water, the small 
end resting on the bottom of the glass. If considerably older than 
this, the egg will float on the top of the water. If the egg has been 
preserved in some way, it will probably be older than this would 
Indicate. 



EGOS 101 

HOW TO PRESERVE EGGS 

Eggs are caused to spoil by germs that make their way through 
the shell, which is porous. The water in the egg also slowly evapo- 
rates with age. To preserve eggs, then, they must be protected from 
germs and from evaporation. The usual method of keeping eggs on 
a large scale is by cold storage. For home use, the best way of 
preserving eggs is by the use of silicate of soda, or water glass. 
Use perfectly fresh, clean eggs, but do not wash them. Pack them in 
a crock, and cover them with a solution of one part silicate of soda 
to ten parts of water that has been boiled and cooled. Put a cover 
on the crock, and set in a cool place. The silicate of soda can be 
obtained at a drug store. Eggs preserved in this way will keep six 
or eight months. The flavor of the eggs is not affected. They will 
be found to be as good as store eggs. If it is desired to boil them, 
the shell should be pierced with a needle. When using a number of 
eggs, always break each separately into a small dish to avoid spoiling 
the whole by any stale egg that might be in the lot. 

TO SEPARATE WHITE FROM YOLK 

To separate the yolk from the white of an egg, break the shell 
gently in the middle either with a knife or by tapping the egg against 
the edge of the dish into which the white is to be put, open slightly, 
and allow the white to run out. Turn the yolk from one* half of the 
shell into the other till all the white has run out. Be sure that not 
a particle of the yolk gets into the white, because this will prevent 
it from beating very stiff. Also be sure that not a particle of oil 
or cream or milk or anything greasy gets into the white, or is in 
the bowl or on the beater; for these will prevent the white from 
stiffening. Also have the white cold. 

Never beat the whites till you are ready to use them, because 
they gradually go back to the unbeaten state, and it is not possible 
to beat them stiff a second time. If you have whites or yolks left 
over, the whites may be kept, unbeaten, in a glass or bowl in the 
refrigerator or in a cold place; and left-over yolks may be kept nicely 
by covering them with water. The water should be poured off when 
the yolks are to be used. 

WEIGHT AND MEASUREMENT OF EGGS 

It is sometimes convenient to know the weight and measure- 
ment of eggs. They are as follows: 

9 eggs weigh about one pound 
5 eggs equal one cup 
9 egg whites equal one cup 
12 egg yolks equal one cv\\^

RECIPES 

To Cook Effffs 

To cook an egg so as to have the white most digestible, it should 
be cooked at a temperature that is high enough to coagulate it, but 
not high enough to toughen it. Albumen begins to coagulate at 
145° F. It sets into a jelly at 165° F., and becomes hard and tough 
at the boiling point of water, 212° F.; therefore, to be most digestible, 
eggs should not be boiled nor fried. They should be cooked at a 
temperature below the boiling point of water. 

Dropped or Poached Earars 

Use a basin about six or eight inches across, and from two to 
two and one-half inches deep. Have it full of hot, not boiling 
water, salted with one-half teaspoon of salt to one quart of water. 
Break the eggs into a small dish, then slide them into the water. 
Let them cook till the white is set, then with a small skimmer re- 
move the eggs from the water to a hot dish, or serve them on zwie- 
back that has been dipped in hot cream. Oiled muffin rings may be 
put into the water, and the eggs dropped into them to hold tiiem 
in shape better. Or an egg poacher may be used. Do not try to 
poach eggs in barely enough water to cover them. The water should 
be one and one-half inches deep, or deeper. Dropped eggs may also 
be served on toasted corn flakes, or hash, or in nests of boiled rice 
or mashed potato. 

Effsrs Cooked in the Shell 

Put the eggs into water at 165° F. by the thermometer, and leave 
them five minutes if desired very soft, eight minutes if desired me- 
dium, or longer if desired hard. The white of the egg will be of a 
jelly-like consistency resembling soft custard, in which condition it 
is more easily digested than when raw. If it is desired to keep the 
eggs hot after they are cooked, the temperature of the water should 
be reduced to 145° F., at which temperature they will cook no more. 
To obtain this result without the use of the thermometer, use one 
and one-half cups of water for each egg to be cooked. Have the 
water in a dish in which it will be deep enough to cover all the 
eggs, and which has a tight-fitting cover. Bring the water to a 
boil. Set the dish off the stove. Put the eggs into the water. Put 
the cover on the dish, and allow the eggs to remain in the water from 
five to ten minutes, according to how much it is desired to cook them. 

The yolk of an egg is most digestible when hard and mealy. To 
cook the yolk thus the egg should be boiled about three hours. The 
white may then be made digestible by grinding to a powder through 
a food chopper, using the nut butter cutter, or by rubbing through 
a very fine sieve. Or separate the white from the yolk of the egg, 
and steam or boil the yolk for three hours. 



Slishtly oil au omelet pan. Put into it one-fourth cup cream, 
then break in three eggs. Add one fourth teaspoon salt. Cook 
slowly, stirring and scraping the egg from the bottom of the pan, 
till it Is of a creamy conaiatency.

EffflT Croquettes 

Make a thick white sauce by using one-fourth cup flour to one 
cup milk. Rub hard-boiled eggs through a colander. Add just 
enough of the sauce to the egg to stick it together, not enough to 
make the mixture so soft that it cannot be shaped into croquettes. 
Allow the mixture to get cold. Dip balls of the mixture into beaten 
egg and water (one tablespoonful water to one egg). Roll in zwie- 
back crumbs. Shape in a croquette mold. Bake ten minutes in a 
hot oven. Serve each croquette on a bed of mashed potato, and 
pour tomato sauce over it.

and bake in a moderate oven till just set. Turn out of the molds, 
and serve surrounded with peas, or with bread sauce or tomato sauce 
or rice tomato sauce, that is, tomato sauce in which a little rice has 
been cooked before thickening it. Or serve the timbales on cream- 
gravy toast. 

A smaller proportion of milk may be used in making the timbales. 
One-fourth cup milk to each egg is sometimes used.

this table it will be seen that all these vegetables — except 
i sweet potatoes, green peas, and green corn — have a lower 
I value than milk, that is, there is more water in them than 
in milk. The bulk of this class of vegetables is made up of 
id cellulose or woody fiber. Their dietetic value is due to

tain. They require cooking to break up and soften the cellulose, Bud, 
in some of them, to burst the starch grains, thus rendering tli^ 
starch soluble. 

Green vegetables are best cooked the day they are gathered. If 
this is impossible, one should endeavor to keep them in as fresh a 
condition as possible by putting them in a cool, dark place. 

Vegetables, being valuable largely for their mineral content and 
their flavors, should be cooked in such a manner as not to lose the 
former nor impair the latter. To cook vegetables properly by boiling, 
so as to retain the natural properties, they should be put to cook in 
boiling water, using as little water as possible without burning, be- 
cause water, especially if it is not boiling when the vegetables are 
put in, dissolves the salts and some of the other nutritive material; 
so the less water there remains to be poured off after the cooking, 
the less of these will be lost. 

While the water should be kept boiling, the boiling should not be 
violent. Gentle boiling is best. As long as water is boiling, lU 
temperature cannot be increased. If water must be added during the 
process of cooking, it should be boiling. Vegetables should be cooked 
till they are just done, but no longer. If salt is to be added as sea- 
soning, the best time to add it, generally, is just before the vegetables 
are done. 

RECIPES 

POTATOES 

The ideal in cooking potatoes is to render them as mealy as may 
be, and to lose as little as possible of the nutritive value. A 
mealy potato is more easily digested than bread. Toung potatoes 
contain a larger percentage of protein and are more juicy than ma- 
ture potatoes. This protein, being coagulated by cooking, holds 
together, and the potato is more waxy. For this reason mature pota- 
toes are more wholesome than young ones. 

Baked Potatoes 

Choose medium-sized, smooth potatoes. Wash and scrub them 
with a stiff vegetable brush till they are perfectly clean, clean 
enough so that the skins may be eaten, if desired. If any dirt 
adheres to the skin that a brush will not remove, scrape it off with 
a knife. Dry the potatoes, then bake them in a moderately hot 
oven till they will yield to the pressure of the fingers. Baked pota- 
toes are best served as soon as they are done. 

Boiled Potatoes in Jackets

them into just sufficient boiling water to cook them, and boil till

Nearly all the directions for the use of Irish potatoes may be 
dlowed in cooking sweet potatoes. 

TURNIPS 

Select solid turnips. Wash and scrub them well. Slice them into 
lalf-inch slices, then pare the slices, paring deep enough to remove 
he white lining just underneath the skin, which is usually bitter. 

Mashed Turnips 

After preparing the turnips as just described, steam them until 
hey are tender or boil in as little water as will cook without scorch- 
ng, having the water boiling when the turnips are put into it. Do 
lot cook too long, for this will turn them dark and give them a 
itrong flavor. Then, if boiled, drain off the water (which will make 
;ood soup stock), and either mash them with a potato masher or 
)ut them through a colander. Season with salt and hot cream or a 
ittle butter. 

Creamed Turnips 

After the turnips are sliced and peeled as directed, cut into half- 
nch dice; or peel the turnips whole, then cut balls from them with 
L vegetable cutter. The turnip which remains after cutting the balls, 
nay be used for mashed turnip or for making soup. Steam the 
lice, or balls, or boil in as little water as will cook without scorching, 
adding salt just before they are done. Drain, if boiled, and put into 
ream sauce.

CARROTS 

Scrub the carrots well, scrape with a knife to remove the skins, 
and put into cold water. 

Mash«d Carrots 

If the carrots are large, either split or slice them, and follow the 
directions for Mashed Turnips. 

Creamed Carrots 

Follow the directions for Creamed Turnips. 

Carrots with Earg Saace 

Prepare as for Creamed Carrots, adding one chopped hard-boiled 
egg to the cream sauce. 

Carrots with Fine Herbs 

Slice three large carrots and boil them. Chop one small onion, 
and cook in one tablespoon of oil till lightly browned. Add the 
water in which the carrots were cooked, and boil the onion five min- 
utes. Add the carrots and one dessertspoon of chopped parsley, and 
boil three minutes. Remove from the fire, and squeeze in the juice 
of half a lemon. Add salt. Garnish with croutons. 

Carrots Maitre d'Hotel 

Cut the carrots into halves lengthwise, and boil in salted water, 
or steam. Place on an oiled dripping pan. Sprinkle with lemon 
juice, a little sugar, and chopped parsley. Bake till well heated 
through. 

Carrots and Peas 

Prepare as for Creamed Carrots, using with the carrots an equal 
quantity of green peas. This makes a pretty dish, the color of the 
peas and that of the carrots blending well together. 

PARSNIPS 
Browned Parsnips 

After cleaning and scraping the parsnips, cut them lengthwise 
into slices one-fourth inch thick and two and one-half inches long. 
Steam or boil the slices in a small amount of water till nearly ten- 
der. When the parsnips are young, this will require scarcely more 
than ten minutes after they begin to cook. Drain, and put the slices 
in an oiled baking pan. Brush over with salted cream or cream 
sauce. If boiled, pour the water in which they were cooked, of which 
there should be only a small amount, into the pan. Brown in a hot 
oven. 

BEETS 

Beets should be plump, solid, and unshriveled. Before cooking 
they should be washed and scrubbed with a vegetable brush, hut 
should not be scraped or cut; for the skin must not be broken, he-

cause that would allow the sweet Juice to escape. Beets should not 
be pricked with a fork to determine when they are done. When 
sufficiently cooked, they will yield to the pressure of the fingers. 
Young beets can be boiled in one hour, but old ones may require 
three or four hours. 

Baked Beets 

Beets lose the least nourishment in the process of cooking if 
baked. It requires two or three hours to. bake them; they should be 
placed on the grate, like potatoes, and should bake slowly. 

steamed Beets 

The next best way to cook beets is to steam them. 

Boiled Beets 

The beets should be put to cook in boiling water, using as little 
water as will cook without scorching them, and the water should be 
nearly evaporated when they are done. When cooked, put them into 
cold water; then the skins can be easily rubbed off with the fingers. 

After being cooked in any of these ways, the beets may be sliced, 
sprinkled with salt, and served hot, dressed with a little butter sub- 
stitute, one tablespoon to one quart of beets, or they may be served 
hot in lemon Juice, or in equal parts of lemon juice and water. A 
little sugar may be added if desired. Or a cream sauce may be 
poured over the beets Just before they are served. 

Cream Baked Beets 

Slice cooked beets into a baking pan. Pour over them thin cream 
to three fourths the depth of the beets, adding one level teaspoon 
salt to each cup of cream. Bake forty-five minutes. 

Sliced or Chopped Beets with Lemon 

Cover sliced or chopped cold cooked beets 'with diluted lemon 
juice, and allow them to stand one hour or more before serving. 

GREENS 

Greens of all kinds are a class of vegetables from which the food 
substances for which they are valuable may be very easily lost in 
the process of cooking if special pains are not taken to cook them in 
such a manner as not to lose these substances. The easy way to cook 
greens is to boil them in a large quantity of water. There will then 
be no danger of scorching them. But the objection to this method 
is that the large quantity of water dissolves the mineral salts, 
which gives to greens their principal dietetic value, and then the 
water is thrown away. If the greens are to be boiled, no more water 
than is necessary should be used. A better method of cooking greens, 
however, is by steaming.

Beet Greens 



Select young beets, and look them over carefully, rejecting any 
imperfect leaves. Do not cut the tops from the beets. Wash thor- 
oughly. After the greens are cooked, drain well, if boiled. Chop 
them, add salt and lemon juice, and a little butter or salad oil; or 
omit the lemon juice and serve with lemon quarters, thus allowing 
each person to suit his taste as to the use of the lemon. 

ONIONS 
Boiled Onions 

Put the onions in water while peeling, and drop into water after 
they are peeled. This will make the task of peeling less disagree- 
able. Put them to cook in a small amount of boiling water, because 
they are very watery, and become more juicy as they cook. Boll till 
just tender, but ngt longer, or they will fall to pieces and become 
dark colored. When partly cooked, add salt and a little butter or 
salad oil. The water in which they were cooked may be thickened 
with a little flour to make a gravy for them, if desired. 

Creamed Onions 

Cook the onions as in the preceding recipe. When tender, drain 
off the water, saving it to be used for soup stock, and pour over them 
a cream sauce. 

ARTICHOKES 

Jerusalem artichokes resemble turnips in that they contain no 
starch, but they are richer in carbohydrates of another nature. 

Creamed Jerusalem Articholces 

Wash the artichokes, scrape them well, and put into salted water 
to prevent discoloring. Put to cook in boiling water to which a 
little milk has been added. Add salt before they are quite done. 
Drain, and pour a cream sauce over them. 

Jerusalem Artichokes in Tomato Sauce 

Prepare and cook the artichokes as in the preceding recipe, then 
pour over them a tomato sauce. 

VEGETABLE OYSTERS, OR SALSIFY 

To prepare for cooking, wash them and boil for three minutes. 
This sets the juices. Then take them, one at a time, on a board, 
and quickly scrape the skin off, dropping them at once into cold 
water. 

stewed Vegetable Oysters 

After preparing the oysters as described, cut them into one-fourth- 
I'nch slices. Put them into a small quantity of boiling water, and 



VEGETABLES 117 

cook till they are tender, adding salt Just before they are done. Then 
add sufficient milk or cream to make a gravy for them. Allow them 
to heat up again, and cook two or three minutes, then thicken with 
a little flour rubbed smooth with cold milk. Serve plain or on nicely 
prepared thin slices of zwieback. 

Scalloped Veffetable Oysters 

Boil the oysters as in the preceding recipe. Let the water be 
nearly evaporated when the oysters are tender. Put layers of the 
oysters in an oiled baking pan, dredging each layer lightly with flour. 
For one quart of the oysters heat one pint of milk and cream (or 
one pint of milk and two tablespoons of butter substitute) to boiling. 
Add two teaspoons salt. Pour it over the oysters, and bake one half 
to three fourths of an hour. 



ASPARAGUS 
Aspararas with Cream Sauce 

Wash the asparagus, and break it as far as it is tender into inch- 
length pieces. Put it to cook in barely enough boiling water to cover 
it, and cook it till just tender, which will require twenty minutes if 
it is young (if it is old, it may require forty-five minutes), adding 
salt a few minutes before it is done. Drain, saving the water for 
soup stock, and pour over it a cream sauce. 

The tough lower portion of the asparagus stalk may be used in 
making soup. 

A^arasruft Tips on Toast 

Wash the asparagus, breaking off the tough portions. Tie it in 
bunches of eight or ten stalks, with the heads even. With a sharp 
knife cut off the lower ends so that the bunches will stand upright, 
leaving the pieces of asparagus about three and one-half inches long, 
then stand them in a kettle containing boiling water, allowing the 
heads to be well out of the water. Cover the kettle tightly. In this 
way the tips will be cooked by the time the less tender portion is 
cooked, and will not be cooked to pieces. Add salt a few minutes 
before the asparagus is done. When it is tender, lift it out of the 
water onto a hot dish, and untie the bunches. Dip nicely prepared 
thin slices of zwieback into the water in which the asparagus was 
boiled. Place each slice on a hot individual platter, put a few stalks 
of the asparagus on each slice of toast, the tips all the same way, 
and pour a little cream sauce over the tips. 

Aaparaffus and Peas 

Prepare asparagus as in the first recipe, using with it an equal 
quantity of green peas.

CELERY 

Celery is one of the most valued of salad herbs, and one of the 
finest flavorings. Celery is best ^\ien eaten raw, if fresh, crisp, and 
tender, but it should be thoroughly masticated. 

To prepare celery for the table, break the stalks apart, wash and 
clean them thoroughly with a vegetable brush, rejecting any green 
portions and tough stalks. Then put them in ice-cold water for an 
hour before serving. The green portions and tough stalks may be 
used in making soups. 

To keep celery fresh when it is not to be used as soon as pur- 
chased, wrap the bunches in brown paper, sprinkle with cold water, 
wrap in a cloth wrung out of cold water, and put in a cool, dark 
place. 

stewed Celery 

Cut tender stalks of celery into inch-lengths. Put into a stew 
pan, ^nd add enough boiling water to half cover the celery. Put a 
cover on the stewpan, and cook slowly till tender. Add salt and a 
little cream, and when boiling thicken with a little flour stirred 
smooth with cold water. 

Celery on Toast 

Cut tender stalks of celery into pieces about two and one-half 
inches long. Put them into a stewkettle with sufficient boiling water 
to half cover them. Stew till tender, adding salt just before they 
are done, and serve on toast in the manner in which asparagus tips 
on toast are served. 

Celery with Tomato Sauce 

Prepare the celery as directed for Stewed Celery, and serve with 
tomato sauce. 

Cream Celery Toast 

Cut tender stalks of celery into one-fourth-inch pieces, and add 
them to a nice cream sauce. This should be served on thin slices of 
zwieback, which have been slightly moistened in hot water. 

SPINACH 

Spinach should be carefully looked over, the tough stalks and 
imperfect leaves being rejected, and should be washed in several 
waters, the spinach lifted from one pan to another each time it is 
washed, thus allowing the sand to settle to the bottom, to be sure 
that it is entirely free from grit. 

Steaming is the best method of cooking spinach, because it ex- 
tracts less of the mineral matter. One should be sure to have enough 
spinach, as it shrinks to one eighth or one tenth of its original bulk. 



VEGETABLES 119 

Boiled Spinach 

One peck of spinach should be cooked in three-fourths cup of 
water, great care being taken that it does not scorch. When tender, 
drain and press it to extract all the water. Chop it, and season with 
salt and a little butter or salad oil. Use sliced' hard-boiled eggs to 
garnish it, and serve lemon quarters with it, or lemon juice may be 
mixed with the spinach. 

A small amount of the water drained from the spinach may be 
used in vegetable soup or broth; a little of it added to gravy will 
give a meaty taste. 

CABBAGE 
Boiled Cabba«e 

Remove all dried outside leaves, and cut the cabbage into eighths 
or smaller, removing the core. Look it over, wash carefully, and put 
it to cook in a small amount of boiling water. Be careful that it does 
not scorch at first. As it cooks, water is extracted from the cab- 
bage, in which it will cook without scorching. Boil till tender, which 
will require from three fourths of an hour to two hours, according to 
the age of the cabbage. Do not cook it too long, as this will turn it 
dark colored and impair its flavor. Add salt and a little butter or 
salad oil, when it is about three fourths done. Serve with lemon 
quarters or pour lemon juice over it. 

Creamed Cabbaffe 

After cleaning and washing the cabbage, cut it into shreds with 
a large, sharp knife. Steam it or boil it in a small quantity of water 
till tender. Drain off the water; whith may be used for soup stock, 
and pour cream sauce over the cabbage. 

Cabbaffe in Tomato Sauce 

Cook as in the preceding recipe, using tomato sauce instead of 
cream sauce. 

Hot Slaw 

Shred one-half head of cabbage. Put into a stewkettle the fol- 
lowing: 

1 tablespoon salad oil 
3^4 cups water 
% cup lemon juice 
Put in the cabbage and cook till tender. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Cauliflower is botanically allied to cabbage. It is more easily 
digested than most other vegetables. 

Break off the outside leaves, cut the flowerets from the stalks 
about two inches below the top of the floweret. If the flowerets are 
large, divide them. Wash and place it in salted water to dxl^^ wi.\.

any insects that may be hidden in it. Much the better way to cook 
it is steaming. It should be cooked till it is just tender, which will 
require from twenty to forty minutes. Longer cooking will turn it 
dark colored. 

BoUed Cauliflower 

Use a kettle of such size that when the cauliflower is stood in It 
stem downward it will hold the cauliflower upright. Have in the 
kettle barely enough boiling water to cover the top of the cauliflower. 
Add salt when it is about three fourths cooked. Treated in this 
manner, the delicate top will not cook to pieces before the stalk is 
tender. 

The cauliflower may be served with lemon juice, cream sauce, 
parsley sauce (cream sauce with chopped parsley added), egg sauce, 
or tomato sauce. 

CORN 
Green Com on the Cob 

To prepare corn for cooking, strip off the husks, and use a small 
vegetable brush to remove all the silk. Steaming is the better way 
to cook corn. It should be steamed from flfteen to twenty-flve min- 
utes, according to the size of the kernels and the age of the com. 
To boil it, put it into sufficient boiling water to nearly cover it. 
Cover the kettle tightly and cook from flve to flfteen minutes from 
the time the water begins to boil after putting in the corn. Too 
long cooking hardens the kernels. The older the corn the less it 
may be cooked without hardening. It should be served hot as soon 
as cooked. It may be served in a napkin to keep it hot. 

stewed Com 

After removing the husks and silk, cut the tops from the kernels 
with a sharp knife, then scrape out the pulp. To one pint of pulp 
add one-half cup cream and one-half teaspoon salt. Cook in a double 
boiler three fourths of an hour. Cold cooked corn on the cob may 
be cut from the cob and cooked in this manner, but will require only 
long enough cooking to heat it thoroughly. 

To Use Canned Corn 

Turn the corn from the can into a double boiler. Corn is very 
liable to scorch if heated in a dish set directly over the flre. Season 
with cream and salt, and cook till the corn is well heated through. 

Dried Com 

Left-over corn on the cob may be cut from the cob, spread on a 
pan, and dried in a warm oven or near the stove. When thoroughly 
dry, put into a cheesecloth bag and store in a cool, dry place. To 
cook the dried corn, soak it overnight, then stew slowly till tender, 
and season the same as stewed green corn.

PEAS 
Stewed Green Peas 

Shell and wash the peas and put to cook in one cup of boiling 
water for each quart of peas. Boil gently till they are tender, 
which will require from twenty to fifty minutes, according to the age 
of the peas. When tender, season with salt and add sufficient cream 
to make as juicy as desired. The juice may b6 thickened with flour. 
If preferred without milk or cream, two tablespoons of butter may 
be used to the quart of peas. The juice may then be thickened or not 
as preferred. A sprig of mint cooked with the peas gives them a 
pleasant flavor. Or a small bunch of parsley, four small onions, and 
the washed leaves of one head of lettuce may be cooked with one 
quart of peas, and removed when the peas are tender. Season. 

Canned Green Peas 

Drain the water from the peas, rinse them well in cold water, 
add fresh hot water, heat, and season li^e fresh peas. 

BEANS 
Shelled Beans or Lima Beans 

Shell and wash the beans. Put to cook in enough boiling water 
to cover well. To have them at their best, beans should be cooked, 
not only until they are just barely tender, when they have a dis- 
agreeable, raw, beany taste, but for two or three hours, when they 
will be rich and delicious, and that peculiarly beany taste will be 
gone. Season with salt and cream or butter. 

Succotash 

This dish is borrowed from the American Indians. The word is 
taken from the Narraganset Indian word rrCsicTcquatash. 

Cook one pint of fresh Lima beans. Cut from the cob sufficient 
corn to make one pint. When the beans are tender, add the corn, 
and cook them together fifteen or twenty minutes. Season with 
cream or butter and salt. Canned corn may be used instead of fresh, 
and stewed dry Lima beans instead of fresh beaiv^.

Strinjr Beans 

Wash the beans. Break off the stems and points in such a way 
as to pull off the strings from both edges of the pods. If it is de- 
sired to remove the strings more thoroughly, pare both edges of the 
pods. Lay a handful of the beans side by side on a board and cut 
them all at once into three-fourths-inch lengths; or if it is desired 
to have the beans more dainty, split the pods lengthwise, cutting 
through the pod from one side to the other, not from one edge to 
the other; then, instead of cutting the pods square across, cut them 
diagonally into one-and-one-half-inch lengths. Put to cook in sufB- 
cient boiling water to cover, and cook from one to three hours. Sea- 
son with salt and cream, salad oil, or butter. The Juice may be 
thickened with a little flour, if desired. 

Canned String Beans 

Drain the water from the beans. Rinse in cold water. Add fresh 
hot water. Boil for a few minutes, and season the same as fresh 
beans. 

TOMATOES 

Tomatoes are at their best when served fresh as a salad vege- 
table. They may be peeled by pouring scalding water over them, 
allowing them to stand for a moment, then putting them into cold 
water, when the skin can be easily peeled off. After being peeled, 
they should be put into the refrigerator and kept cold till they are 
to be served. They may then be sliced and served on lettuce leaves 
with a lemon quarter or a spoonful of mayonnaise salad dressing on 
each individual dish. Some prefer to peel them without scalding 
them. They should be peeled thin with a sharp knife. They are 
then more firm. They are sometimes served without removing the 
peeling. 

Instead of simply slicing the tomatoes, they may be cut into 
quarters, thirds, sixths, eighths, and these pieces placed side by side 
on an individual dish and garnished with parsley; or the pieces may 
be placed in the shape of a cross, and a spoonful of mayonnaise 
dressing put where the ends meet. 

Another way is to cut a tomato as if you were going to cut it 
into quarters, but only cut three fourths through it. Let the quarters 
fall apart slightly and put a spoonful of mayonnaise dressing in 
the opening. Serve on lettuce. 

Still another way is to put a whole tomato, stem end down, on 
a lettuce leaf or a bed of lettuce, dip a knife in mayonnaise, and cut 
across the top of the tomato; dip the knife again in the mayonnaise, 
and cut at right angles to the first cut, making a cross on the top 
of the tomato.

SALADS 



In salads, vegetable oils, which have no inconsiderable dietetic 
value, and for the taking of which many feel an aversion, may be so 
disguised with other wholesome foods, such as fresh vegetables, that 
the whole is made a very palatable food combination of real health- 
giving value, the oil supplying real nourishment, while the other 
ingredients supply substances of medicinal value in the form of acids, 
salts, and vitamines, in combination with pure water. A properly 
prepared salad of the right kind is a far better medicine than any 
emulsion of cod-liver oil. 



PREPARING AND SERVING 

Vegetables and leaves should be fresh, crisp, and tender. Tough 
and bruised parts should be removed. Lettuce, celery, parsley, spin- 
ach, endive, and dandelion should be washed in cold water, allowed to 
stand in ice water till crisp, then drained and put into the refriger- 
ator until serving time, when they should be dried with cheesecloth 
if any water remains on them. It should be remembered that winter 
greens are raised under glass, and should be treated as any other 
hothouse plant. Lettuce is aftected by a change of temperature, and 
will wilt just as quickly as delicate flowers. 

To prepare lettuce for garnishing salads, cut out the tough lower 
part of the midrib of the leaf. Vegetable salads may be garnished 
with lettuce, parsley, beets cut in various shapes, olives, tomatoes 
eat in different ways, nuts, radishes cut in the shape of tulips or in 
slieefl, slices of lemon. 

Fruit salads may be garnished with parsley, lettuce, nuts, sec- 
ileim of orange from which the rind has not been removed, nastur- 
^um leaves and flowers, pansies, sweet peas, or other flowers, and 
smilax. A pretty way to serve a fruit salad is to put it into a sherbet 
glass, set the glass on a small paper doily on a salad plate, and lay 
a wreath of smilax around the glass on the plate. 

To prepare oranges for salad, pare them as you would x>&i*e an 
apple, removing all the white skin on the outside of the orange. Then 
by catting with a sharp knife on each side of the membranes that 
separate the sections, remove the sections free from membrane, then 
cut the sections into small pieces. 

To prepare white grapes for salad, pour boiling water over them, 
let them stand a few moments, then pour off the water and pour cold 
water over them. The skin can then be easily peeled off. Remove 
the seeds also.

When apple or banana is used in salad, the dressing should be 
made first, and the apple or banana cut into it, so it will not turn 
dark by standing exposed to the air after being cut. 

Salad should always be served cold. Green salad plants lose 
their crispness by standing in the dressing; therefore the dressing 
should be added to green salads just before serving. Left-over cooked 
vegetables may be well utilized in salad. With salads of this kind 
it is well to mix the dressing, and then allow the salad to stand in a 
cold place for an hour before serving, so that the ingredients may 
become seasoned with the dressing. 

The ingredients of a salad should not be carelessly stirred to- 
gether, but should be gently " tossed together " with as little handling 
as possible. Vinegar is a product of decomposition; therefore we 
do not recommend its use. Lemon juice, with whose medicinal qual- 
ities all are acquainted, is to be recommended instead. The dish in 
which the salad is served may be rubbed with a cut onion or with 
the cut end of a clove of garlic, to give a delicate flavor. Some kind 
of hard bread, like crackers, is usually served with salad. 

I do not use olive oil in making salad dressings. Instead, I use 
a salad oil which has no flavor, and flnd that people who think they 
cannot eat salad dressing because the flavor of olive oil is disagree- 
able to them, enjoy my dressing. There are other oils which are 
almost, if not quite, as valuable foods as olive oil, and they are less 
expensive. 

RECIPES 

Mayonnaise Dressinar 

1 egg yolk 

1 teaspoon flour 

1 cup salad oil 

4 tablespoons lemon juice 

1 teaspoon salt 

Put the egg yolk into a bowl. Beat it with an egg beater till it 
begins to thicken, then stir the flour into it. Add a drop or two 
of oil and beat it in, then add a drop or two more and beat it in. 
Continue beating in the oil in this way, adding a few more drops 
at a time after the flrst few additions of oil. When the mixture be- 
comes too thick to beat, thin it with lemon juice, then beat in oil 
again. Continue in this way till all the oil is used. Use enough 
lemon juice to make the dressing of the desired consistency. Lastly, 
beat in the salt. 

• 

If the oil fails to unite with the egg, it will be necessary to begin 
over again, putting another egg yolk into a clean bowl and beating 
the oil-and-egg mixture which failed to unite, drop by drop, into the 
new egg yolk. This dressing will keep two weeks or more if kept 
in a cool place.

French Dressinff 

1^ tablespoons oil 
1% tablespoons lemon juice 
% teaspoon salt 

The ingredients of this dressing may vary. More oil than lemon 
juice may be used, or more lemon juice than oil. Have the oil and 
lemon juice, also the bowl in which the dressing is to be made, very 
cold. With a fork stir the salt into the oil, then beat the lemon 
juice drop by drop into the oil. The oil will turn white, thicken, and 
become creamy. Pour at once over the salad, and serve. If the 
dressing is allowed to stand long before using, it will separate. Use 
only as much of the dressing as the salad will take up, not enough 
so that any will drain out of the salad into the bottom of the bowl 
or onto the plate on which the salad is served.

French dressing may be used with diced cucumbers and thinly 
sliced radishes. It may also be used on lettuce, young, tender leaves 
of spinach, endive, cold cooked spinach, and cold cooked dandelions. 



8ALAD8 131 

The best way to prepare lettuce to use with French dressing is to 
shred it. To do this, cut the large leaves once or twice lengthwise, 
then pile several leaves together and roll them up into a tight roll, 
then with a sharp knife cut across the roll, making fine shreds. 
Shake the shreds apart. Remember, in using French dressing with 
this shredded lettuce, to use only as much dressing as the lettuce 
will take up. 

Boiled mayonnaise dressing is sometimes poured, while hot, over 
young, tender raw dandelions, when they are served at once. 

Nut Cheese and Potato Salad 

With equal parts of diced nut cheese and potato use tomato salad 
dressing. Onion may be used with this if liked.

table salads for those who enjoy the flavor.

and around each yolk place the triangular pieces of white so that 
the sharpest corner of each piece is toward the yolk. Drop bits of 
mayonnaise on the lettuce around the white.

SANDWICHES 

The bread used in making sandwiches should be fine grained. 
All kinds can be used — white, whole-wheat, Graham, rye, nut, and 
steamed brown bread. The bread should be one day old, as fresher 
bread is less- wholesome and cannot be cut into smooth, thin slices. 

We do not recommend removing the crust from sandwiches, which 
is usually thought necessary; for the crust is the best part of the 
bread. However, if something especially dainty is desired, the crust 
may be removed. In that case the crust should be cut off before the 
bread is buttered. This will avoid wasting butter, and the crust can 
then be dried and made into zwieback crumbs, for which there are 
many uses. 

If it is desired to make the sandwiches especially thin and dainty, 
this can be most easily done by cutting the loaf of bread in two in 
the middle, spreading each cut surface with butter, cutting off a thip 
slice from each buttered end, and putting the two slices together. 
Continuing thus, the slices will all fit together. The butter should 
be creamed, not melted. After the slices have all been buttered, the 
filling can be put in; but for ordinary sandwiches the desired amount 
of bread should first be sliced, the slices being piled together as they 
are cut off, then the slices should be spread with butter and put 
together in pairs. Next spread the filling on one of the slices, and 
press the second slice upon the filling. 

The filling should be something of pronounced flavor, such as 
cottage cheese, ripe olives, jelly, or, if that which is to be used as 
filling has little flavor, something should be used with it to add more 
flavor. 

After the sandwiches are all filled, they may be cut into any de- 
sired shape. Cutting them cornerwise makes a convenient shape, or 
cutting them twice parallel with the edges makes oblong sandwiches. 
Sandwiches are sometimes cut into diamonds, crescents, rounds, and 
other shapes, but this is wasteful, and is done only because the 
person desires to do something different. To make round sandwiches 
the bread can be baked in small round tin cans. 

If the sandwiches are not to be used at once, they should be cov- 
ered with a cloth wrung out of cold water, and set In a cool place to 
keep them moist. 

Like other foods, sandwiches can Ije made more attractive by a 
little attention to garnishing. Lettuce or parsley placed between the 
slices so as to make a pretty green edge around the sandwich, is very 
attractive, Lettuce, parsley, carrot tops, ferns, or other pretty green 



138 GOOD FOOD 

leaves, also flowers, may be used to garnish a plate of sandwiches. 
Sandwiches should be served piled on a plate covered with a doily. 

Baked Bean Sandwiches 

Mash the beans enough to break them up a little, not enough to 
make pur^e of them, because the sandwiches are nicer if there is 
something to chew. Use the beans plain, or season them with lemon 
juice, or spread one slice of the bread with salad dressing. Brown 

bread may be used for these.

Lentil Sandwiches 

• 

When you have lentils left over, make them into dry pur^e, by 
cooking them down dry and rubbing them through a colander. Sea- 
son the pur^e with salt and a few chopped walnuts, and you have a 
splendid sandwich filling. 

Nut Sandwiches 

Spread peanut butter on one slice of buttered bread, and cover 
with the other slice. Or season the peanut butter with a little lemon 
juice and salt, or a little tomato juice and salt. Or make a mixture 
of chopped nuts of two or three kinds with a little peanut butter, add- 
ing salt to season, and enough oil to make the mixture soft enough 
to spread. Or mix chopped nuts of any kind to a paste with butter, 
and spread on one slice of bread and cover with the other slice. 
Garnish with one or two nut meats pressed on top of each sandwich. 

Jelly Sandwiches 

Spread one slice of buttered bread with jelly, and cover with the 
other slice. Garnish with halves of walnut or pecan meats. 

Nut and Jelly Sandwiches 

Use any kind of chopped nuts, and mix them to a paste with jelly. 
Spread the bread with butter, then for each sandwich spread one 
slice of buttered bread with the paste, and cover with the other slice. 
Graham or brown bread is nice for these. 

Cottace Cheese Sandwiches 

Use cottage cheese seasoned with salt and cream (sour cream 
may be used) as a filling, or mix a little mayonnaise salad dressing 
with the cheese. Rye bread is nice for these. 

Cottage Cheese and Ripe Olive Sandwiches 

Use two parts cottage cheese and one part chopped ripe olives, 
and a little mayonnaise salad dressing. Or use cottage cheese, ripe 
olives, and a little peanut butter, just enough to give a faint flavor, 
using oil* or water to moisten the fllling if necessary.

after it gets cold. 

Another good way to prepare eggs for sandwiches is this: 

Cover the bottom of a slightly oiled omelet pan with a thin layer 
of velvet egg mixture, and cook over a moderate heat till it sets in 
a thin sheet, then cut this sheet into pieces of the desired size and 
shape for the sandwiches.

free use of fruits in the diet takes away unnatural cravings, takes 
away the appetite for tobacco, liquor, condiments, tea, coffee, and

While fruits are rather deficient in nutritive material, their cleans- 
ing and disinfecting properties put them at the head of the list of 
wboleaome foods. No patent medicine can compare with them as 
blood purifiers. Their nutritive constituents are almost wholly car- 
bohydrates, and these carbohydrates are in the form of fruit sugar 
and grape sugar, which are predigested foods, all ready for use in 
the aystem. Fruit juice, such as a glass of orange juice, for instance, 
quickly affords relief, refreshment, and strength to one who is fa- 
tigued, because its true nourishment is quickly taken up by the 
system. 

Fruits aid digestion by reason of the stimulating properties of 
their acids and sweets, also by reason of their flavors. A food which 
is appetizing, which we enjoy, is more readily digested than one 
which is not appetizing. A food which has very little flavor does 
not arouse the stomach to action as does a food of marked flavor. 
Some fruits, like the pineapple, contain a digestive principle some- 
what similar to pepsin, which makes them still greater aids to 
digeBtion. 

Fruits consist essentially of: (1) The cellulose framework, which 
contains the juice; and (2) the juice, which is water holding in solu- 
tion fruit sugar and acids. Th6 acids are either free or in combina- 
tion with minerals in the form of salts. 

The acids of fruits are: Malic, in apples, pears, and peaches; 
citric, in lemons, limes, and oranges; tartaric, in grapes; and pectic, 
which is the jelly-producing substance. Rhubarb, which is really a 
vegetable, contains oxalic acid. The acids of, fruits are digestible, 
being used in the system as sugars are used, and when burned in the 
body, help to render the blood more alkaline. " In some diseases, 
such as scurvy, this property is turned to therapeutic account." 

While fruit juices are very readily taken up by the system, the 
digestibility of fruits themselves depends upon the nature of the 
cellulose, or framework, those fruits whose framework is most deli- 
cate and most easily broken up being most digestible. Unripe fruit 
differs from ripe fruit in that it contains raw starch, which turns to 
sugar in the ripening process. This raw starch, being indigestible 
in the stomach, renders unripe fruit unwholesome. Unripe fruits 
contain more cellulose than ripe, which makes them less digestible, 
and a larger proportion of acids, which, being irritating, frequently 
cause diarrhea and colic. 

All fruits to be eaten raw should be thoroughly cleaned before 
serving. As a rule, fruit, when perfectly ripe, is of greater dietetic 
value eaten raw than when cooked. Unripe fruit requires cooking. 
The utensils used for cooking fruit should be graniteware or alumi- 
num, because fruit acids act upon other metals. Fruit should be pre- 
pared just before cooking, to preserve its flavor and prevent discolor- 
ation. It should be cooked in as small a quantity of water as will 
properly cook it.

Sugar, when boiled with an acid, turns to glucose, which is only 
about one third as sweet as sugar; therefore it is a matter of econ- 
omy to add sugar to stewed fruit after the fruit is cooked, and the 
sauce will be much more wholesome if only sufficient sugar is added 
to make it palatably, not enough to make it very sweet. It is well 
to cultivate a taste for fresh fruits, and sauces in which there is 
little , sugar, instead of the preserves so commonly eaten. 

Fruits should be stewed or simmered gently, to preserve their 
shape, appearance, and flavor. Such strong flavors as cinnamon, 
clove, nutmeg, and other spices cover up the natural flavors of fruits, 
which the cook's art should preserve as perfect as possible. One fruit, 
however, may be flavored with another, or with the perfume of flow- 
ers, or with nuts. Thus, apple may be flavored with lemon, pine- 
apple, grape, quince, rose, citron, almond, walnut, or cocoanut. 

STRAWBERRIES 
To Prepare for Servins 

Put the berries, a few at a time, into cold water, wash them 
carefully till entirely clean and free from sand, then hull them. 
They should be served very soon after they are prepared. 

Like all other fruits, if one is to reap the full benefits from 
eating them they should be eaten without cream and with little or 
no sugar. (We enjoy picking strawberries and eating them without 
sugar. Why should we insist upon having sugar with them at the 
table?) 

Large, selected strawberries may be served on the stem. They are 
then picked up by the stem with the fingers, dipped into the sugar, 
which may be placed on the side of the dish, and eaten from the 
stem. 

The flavor of pineapple blends well with that of strawberries. A 
diah of strawberries and diced pineapple together is very appetizing.

DESSERTS 



Some persons may feel that desserts which are mixtures of milk 
and sugar should never be made. It is true that " large quantities of 
milk and sugar eaten together are injurious/' and that " sugar, when 
la.rgely used, is more injurious than meat." Others, may feel that if 
SL milk-and-sugar dessert is made with very little sugar, it will be 
comparatively wholesome; while to still others such a dessert would 
ta.8te so insipid that they would rather have no dessert, and would 
feel that if they are going to have a milk-and-sugar dessert, they 
^^ant it sweet enough to be palatable, and would think best to have 
Ruch a dessert only occasionally, and when they do have it, eat spar- 
ingly of it. This would^not be eating large quantities of milk and 
sxigar together. 

Desserts might be classified as follows: Milk desserts without 
^Sgs, custard desserts, fruit desserts, gelatin desserts, sago and tapi- 
oca desserts, steamed puddings. Pies (pages 177-187) and frozen 
ciesserts (pages 203-205) are also classified as desserts. 

RECIPES 

MILK DESSERTS WITHOUT EGGS 
Irish Mo«8 Blancmansre 

1 quart milk 

^ ounce (a small handful) Irish moss 

% cup sugar 

^/4 teaspoon salt 

V2 teaspoon vanilla 

Prepare the moss by soaking and washing it in four changes of 
cold water, allowing it to soak about fifteen minutes the first time 
and five or ten minutes the succeeding times, picking it out of each 
water into the other with the fingers, carefully looking it over, and 
removing any sand or dark spots. 

Put the milk into a double boiler to heat. When boiling hot, put 
the washed moss into the hot milk and cook thirty minutes. The 
milk will not seem much thickened, but it will be solid when cold. 
Strain* through a fine sieve, stirring the moss to allow all the milk 
to drain out. Add the remaining ingredients to the milk. Stir well 
to dissolve the sugar. Pour into a mold wet with cold water or pour 
Into individual molds. When cold, turn out of the molds, and serve 
with cream or with sliced bananas and cream. 

Caramel blancmange may be made by adding to the mixture just 
before pouring it into the molds, sufficient caramel to give it a deli- 
cate brown color and a slightly caramel flavor.

Creamy Rice Puddinsr 

1 quart rich milk 

% cup rice, scant 

% cup sugar 
Grated yellow rind of Va lemon 
A pinch of salt 

Wash the rice thoroughly by putting it into a dish, pouring hot 
water over it, and whipping it with a batter whip, then pouring off 
the water, repeating the process till the water remains clear. Be 
careful to grate off only the yellow part of the lemon rind. Put all 
the ingredients into a pudding dish. Cover the dish, set in the oven, 
and bake very slowly till the rice is tender. The pudding should be 
stirred occasionally during the cooking. When the pudding is nearly 
done, the cover may be removed to allow the top of the pudding to 
brown. 

Success in making this pudding depends entirely on the baking. 
It should be baked slowly, until the rice is thoroughly tender, but not 
too long; for if baked too long, the pudding will be too dry. It is 
best served the day after it is made, and should be of a rich, creamy 
consistency when cold; some might enjoy it served hot. One-eighth 
package of raisins may be added to the pudding, if desired. 

Farina Blancmange 

1 pint milk 

^/4 cup sugar 

1^ cup farina 
A few grains salt 

Heat the milk with the sugar in a double boiler. Stir in the 
farina and salt, and continue to stir till the milk is thickened and 
the farina does not settle. Cook it in a double boiler one hour, 
then pour it into cups that have been wet with cold water. When 
cold, unmold and serve with cocoanut sauce. 

Cornstarch blancmange is made by substituting cornstarch for the 
farina, and stirring it smooth with a little of the milk saved out 
for that purpose before stirring it into the hot milk. 

Chocolate Blancman^re 

1 pint milk 

Vi cup sugar 
3 tablespoons cornstarch 

Vi cup health cocoa

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Mix the sugar, cocoa, corn- 
starch, and salt. Pour the hot milk over this mixture, and mix thor- 
oughly. Then return to the double boiler, add the caramel, and cook 
fifteen minutes, or till thickened. Add the vanilla, and pour into 
cups wet with cold water. When cold, unmold and serve with cream. 



DESSERTS 155 



Junket 



Junket is prepared by coagulating milk with rennet. Rennet is 
a digestive principle obtained from the lining of a calf's stomach. 
The same ferment is secreted by the human stomach, and whenever 
sweet milk is taken into the stomach, it is very soon turned to junket. 
Junket tablets may be obtained at any druggist's and at many 
grocers'. To prepare junket: 

To one quart milk add one-fourth cup sugar, a few grains salt, 
and a little lemon or vanilla flavoring. Heat until lukewarm. Junket 
cannot be prepared from sterilized milk. Add one junket tablet, 
which has been dissolved in one tablespoon cold water. Turn into 
custard cups at once. Allow to remain in a warm place without 
disturbing till set, which will take but a few minutes. Then set 
away in a cold place. If allowed to remain warm too long, it may 
sour, or the whey may separate. 

CUSTARD DESSERTS 

Custard desserts are those in which eggs and milk are used. 
Success in making custard desserts depepds very largely on the care 
taken in cooking them. Too long cooking or too high a tempera- 
ture will make them watery, of a rough\ texture and tough consist- 
ency, while they should be jellylike, tender, smooth, and velvety. 
They must be carefully watched during the cooking process, and re- 
moved from the heat at just the right moment. 

To determine when a baked custard is done, dip a clean silver 
knife into hot water, then run it into the custard. If the knife comes 
out clean, the custard is done; biit if some of the custard clings to 
the knife, the custard should be baked a little longer. To determine 
when a boiled custard is done, dip a clean silver spoon into it. If 
the custard coats or masks the spoon, it is done. 

Much better success will result, and a smaller proportion of eggs 
will be required in making baked custards, if they are baked in cups. 
And a cup custard looks much more dainty and attractive when 
served than a serving dipped with a spoon from a dish of custard. 
The cups or the dish in which the custard is baked should always 
be set in a pan of hot water while baking. 

In the making of custard desserts, whenever it is necessary to 
add eggs to a hot mixture or liquid, the precaution should always be 
observed of beating the eggs and stirring some of the hot mixture 
into the beaten eggs before stirring them into the hot liquid, other- 
wise the eggs will form dumplings in the mixture instead of being 
equally and smoothly distributed throughout. 

A richer and more tender custard is made by using only the 
yolks of the eggs, using the proportion of three egg yolks to two and 
one-half cups milk. The egg whites may then be saved for making 
angel cake or snow pudding. In this way both custard and <i^VL<i ^x.-ws.

be made from about the same number of eggs that would be used tor 
custard alone when one uses the whole egg. 

I always heat the milk while preparing the other ingredients 
when making baked custards; this shortens the length of time it 
must be kept in mind and watched during the baking. But the milk 
should not be heated too hot or it will cook the eggs when it Is added 
to them, and the eggs should not cook till after the custard is put 
in the oven. 

Maple Cup Custard (Baked) 

2 cups milk 

% cup maple sirup 

2 drops maple flavoring 

3 egg yolks 

% teaspoon vanilla 
A few grains salt 

Warm the milk. Beat the egg yolks; beat into the yolks the sirup, 
flavoring, and salt; then stir into them the heated milk and beat 
well together. Pour into cups; set the cups in a pan of hot water, 
and bake till the custard is just set. 

Cocoanut Cuatard (Boiled) 

2^2 cups milk 

V'2 cup shredded cocoanut 

Vi cup sugar 
3 egg yolks 
A few grains salt 

Steep the cocoanut in the milk in a double boiler twenty minutes. 
Strain the cocoanut out of the hot milk, pressing it well to extract all 
the milk and flavor. Beat the egg yolks, then beat into them the 
sugar and salt. Stir the hot milk into the egg-and-sugar mixture; 
put it into the double boiler and cook, stirring and watching it con- 
stantly, till it just begins to thicken a little or till it just coats a 
spoon dipped into it. Do not expect it to set or to get as thick as 
baked custard; for just before it gets as thick as you expect it to, 
it will get thin. It will seem too thin when it is cooked sufficiently, 
but it will be thicker after it gets cold. 

A little practice is required to enable one to know when to re- 
move a boiled custard from the flre. As soon as the custard is suffi- 
ciently cooked, set the inner cup of the double boiler which contains 
the custard in cold water, and stir the custard till it cools slightly. 
Then pour into cups or into the dish in which it is to be served, 
and set away to get cold. 

Apple Custard 

Into a pudding pan put 1% quarts of pared, quartered, and cored

Warm the milk. Beat the eggs and yolk» together, then beat the 

sugar into them. Stir into them the hot milk, vanilla, and salt, 

and beat well together. This should be ready when the apples are 

done. Pour this custard over the hot apples, and return to the oven 

to bake just long enough for the custard to set A meringue may 

then be put over the pudding, if desired, by beating the two egg 

whites and folding into them three level tablespoons sugar, spreading 

this on the pudding, and setting it on the grate of the oven long 

enough to color the meringue a light brown. 

Cup Custard (Burnt Orange Flavor) 

Follow the recipe for Maple Cup Custard, using one-fourth cup 
sugar in place of the maple sirup, omit the maple flavoring, and use 
a few drops of caramel to color and flavor, and use the grated rind of 
half an orange instead of the vanilla. 

Grate the orange rind very thin, so as to remove only the colored 
outside part. 

PUDDINGS 
Bread Puddin^r 

1 pint milk 

1^ cups stale bread cut into dice 
% cup sugar 

2 eggs 

% cup stoned dates cut into small pieces 
A few grains salt 

Heat the milk. Add the diced bread to the hot milk. Separate 
the whites from the yolks of the eggs. Beat the yolks. Mix some of 
the hot milk with the beaten yolks, then mix the yolks with the hot 
milk and bread. Add the sugar, salt, and dates. Put into a small 
basin, set the basin in a pan of hot water, and bake till the pudding 
is set. Then beat the egg whites and fold into them three tablespoons 
sugar. Spread this on top of the pudding, and put in the oven to 
brown lightly. Three eggs are sufficient for twice this recipe, using 
two of the whites for meringue. 

Queen of Puddings is made by spreading jelly over the top of the 
bread pudding before putting on the meringue, and putting one fourth 
cup chopped almonds in the pudding instead of the dates.

FRUIT DESSERTS 
Apple Rose Cream 

Quarter and core apples which have red skins, and stew them 
without paring in a very little water. Let them cook down quite 
dry, then rub through a colander. If the apples are of the right kind, 
the pulp will be colored red by the skins. To a pint of the pulp add 
about one-fourth cup sugar, or more if necessary to make it sweet 
enough, a few grains salt, and one-fourth teaspoon rose flavoring. 
Beat the white of one egg very stiff, then beat the apple pulp, a little 
at a time, into the beaten white, and beat till the mixture is light and 
stiff enough to hold its shape. Serve with apple jelly or with cus- 
tard sauce, or with chopped nuts sprinkled over it. 

Brown Betty 

1 quart chopped apples 

1 pint raisins (1 cup would do) 

^ cup sugar 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 

l^ teaspoon salt 
1 cup zwieback crumbs 

Simmer the raisins for fifteen minutes in sufficient water to cover 
them. Drain off the juice and save it. Put half the apples in the 
bottom of a pudding dish; and cover with half the raisins. Sprinkle 
over the raisins half the sugar and half the crumbs. Spread over 
this the rest of the apples; and put the rest of the raisins over the 
top of the apples. Sprinkle on the rest of the sugar and crumbs. Add 



160 GOOD FOOD 

the salt and lemon juice to the water that was drained from th^ 
raisins, and pour it over the top of the pudding. Set the pudding 
in a pan of water, cover, and bake one hour or longer. Remove from 
the pan of water, and bake without the cover long enough to brown 
the top lightly. Serve with cocoanut sauce. 

Prune Whip 

Remove the stones from stewed prunes, and rub a sufficient quan- 
tity through a colander to make one pint of prune pulp. Add one- 
eighth teaspoon salt, one-fourth cup sugar, and one-half teaspoon 
vanilla. Beat two egg whites stiff. Beat the prune pulp into the 
beaten egg whites, and' continue to beat till the mixture is light and 
stlfT. 

For Improved Prune Whip use equal parts of prune pulp and 
raisin pulp. These are made by rubbing stewed raisins or stewed 
prunes through a colander. 

Peaches a la Conde 

Cook in a double boiler one-half cup well-washed rice in three cups 
rich milk or cream with one-half teaspoon salt. This will need to 
be put to cook early, because it will take two hours or more for the 
rice to swell sufficiently to take up all the milk. It should be creamy 
when done. 

While the rice is cooking, prepare the peaches as follows: Pour 
boiling water over them, and let them stand just long enough to 
loosen the skins. Pour off the water and pour cold water over them. 
Cut the peaches into halves. Remove the stones and peel the halves. 
Cook the peaches till tender in scarcely enough water to cover them, 
with sugar to sweeten them a little. Carefully remove them from the 
juice, and thicken the juice with cornstarch stirred smooth with cold 
water, using one tablespoon of cornstarch to each cup of the peach 
juice. 

For each serving put a large spoonful of the rice in a sauce dish. 
Press two halves of peach, cut side in, against opposite sides of the 
rice, and pour some of the thickened juice over the rice. This makes 
a toothsome and wholesome dish. 

PressMi Fruit Puddinr 

Completely cover the bottom of a pudding pan with slices of 
bread. Cover the bread with hot stewed blueberries, sweetened, using 
enough of the berries to moisten the bread well. Put a layer of 
bread on top of the berries. Then cover this with hot berries. Put 
a pan on top of the pudding with a weight on it to press the pudding. 
When cold, cut in squares, and serve with sweetened cream, whipped 
cream, or cocoanut sauce.

Mixed Fruit Dessert 

1 cup Stoned and quartered California grapes (or stoned 

cherries may be used) 

1 cup diced apple 

1 cup diced pineapple 

Y2 cup diced figs 

^ cup pineapple juice or strawberry juice 

y^ cup lemon juice 

Either canned or fresh pineapple may be used. The pineapple 
or strawberry juice may be that which is drained from canned fruit. 
The apples should be mixed with the lemon juice as soon as they are 
cut into dice, to preserve their white color. Carefully mix with them 
the other ingredients, and place the mixture in the refrigerator for 
two hours to allow the flavors to blend. At serving time put the 
fruit into chilled sherbet glasses, and place on top of each a spoonful 
of whipped cream which has been slightly sweetened and flavored 
with vanilla. Or the cream may be piped in the shape of a rosette 
with a pastry tube. 

Fruit Mold 

3 cups raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, or cherry juice 
Sufficient sugar to sweeten to taste 

14 level teaspoon salt 

^ cup cream of wheat 

The juice which is drained from canned fruit may be used for 
this. In this case probably no extra sugar will be needed. 

Heat the fruit juice to boiling in the inner cup of a double boiler 
placed directly over the flre. Whip in the meal, stir till the juice is 
thickened, and then set into the outer cup of the double boiler, which 
contains boiling water, and continue cooking for one hour. Then 
pour into molds wet with cold water, and cool. 

When thoroughly chilled, turn from the molds, and serve with 
cream or whipped cream. 

Blueberry Sponire Pudding 

Into a pudding pan put one quart of blueberries that have been 
looked over and washed. Mix together two-thirds cup sugar, one-

Prepare a plain cake batter, and pour a thin layer of it over the 
hot blueberries. Return to the oven to bake till the cake is cooked 
through. Serve hot with vanilla sauce. 

GELATIN DESSERTS 

We do not recommend the use of animal gelatin, not only because 
It Is an animal product, but because it is made from hoofs and horns, 
and, we are told by persons who ought to know, eyes and other 
organs and parts of the animal which cannot be used for anything 
else.

162 GOOD FOOD 

A most satisfactory substitute for animal gelatin is agar, a sea- 
weed that grows in the Japan Sea, also farther south along the 
eastern coast of Asia, and to some extent along the western coast of 
America. 

Agar is really not gelatin, though the name ** vegetable gelatin " 
has been given it because it can be used as a substitute for animal 
gelatin in making desserts. Agar is cellulose, and has no nutritive 
value. The nutritive value of desserts made with agar is due to the 
sugar and fruit juice used in them. It might be stated here that 
animal gelatin also has slight nutritive value. 

Besides making a good substitute for animal gelatin, agar is 
valuable for the relief of constipation. To prepare it for use for 
this purpose, soak about one-half ounce of the agar in about four 
quarts of hot, but not boiling, water for one-half hour. Turn into 
a colander to drain off the water. Then put the agar into a second 
quantity of hot water for fifteen minutes. Drain, and soak the third 
time. Then drain well.. This successive soaking in hot water and 
draining is to remove the spongy smell and taste which the agar has. 

As a help in the relief of constipation, a sauce dish of this soaked 
agar should be eaten at each meal, with little attempt to masticate it. 
Cream or cream and sugar may be eaten with it to add some pala- 
tability to the dish. The gelatin itself not being digested and having 
absorbed considerable water, helps to retain moisture in the contents 
of the digestive tract. Cellulose of any kind in the food eaten, stim- 
ulates the digestive tract to pass the food along. 

Used as gelatin, one ounce of agar solidifies three quarts of liquid, 
while one ounce of animal gelatin solidifies two quarts of liquid. 

To use as gelatin, the agar should be prepared by soaking and 
draining as was described for preparing it for eating. One-fourth cup 
of agar cut fine with the shears equals one-fourth ounce. 

Grapefruit Jelly 

M> cup grapefruit juice 
114 cups water

While the gelatin is receiving its preliminary preparation of soak- 
ing and draining, mix together the grapefruit juice, water, sugar, 
lemon juice, and salt. Use a lemon drill to obtain the grapefruit 
juice. Both the grapefruit juice and the lemon juice should be 
strained before using. After draining the last time, boil the gelatin 
in the one cup of water till dissolved, then strain it into the remain- 
ing ingredients. Mix well, and pour into a mold or cups wet with 
cold water. When cold, unmold, and serve with cream, whipped

SAGO AND TAPIOCA DESSERTS 

Blancmanges of all kinds, after being turned into cups, should 
be allowed to stand long enough to become thoroughly chilled and 
set. Otherwise they will be too soft to hold their shape when un- 
molded, and you will think there is a mistake in the recipe. But if 
the blancmange is made stiffer, it is much less palatable. Blanc- 
mange should not be tough and rubbery, but should be of a jellylike 
consistency.

PIES 



Pies are generally classed among those articles of diet which are 
most difficult of digestion, and to be avoided by all except persons 
with vigorous digestive powers. The too frequent indulgence in pie 
is supposed to ruin even a vigorous digestion. This is probably true 
when the pies are made with lard; for pork and pork products are 
proverbially difficult of digestion, besides being unwholesome. The 
Bible prohibits the use of animal fat as food, but recommends vege- 
table oil instead. And I am not sure but that pies the crust of which 
is made of a wholesome, easily digested vegetable fat, and in which 
not too much sugar is used, are comparatively wholesome. They are 
at least as much more wholesome than pies made with animal fat 
as vegetable fat is more wholesome than lard. Everybody knows 
that olive oil is considered very wholesome, and even medicinal. 

Even the most wholesome pies, however, can hardly be recom- 
mended to be eaten as freely as bread and sauce, because the large 
proportion of fat cooked with the flour makes the crust so rich that 
it ret^ards digestion somewhat, and the filling of a pie is not palatable 
if not made a little sweeter than stewed fruit is generally made. I 
am only saying that pies made of foods which are recognized as 
pre-eminently wholesome and not made too sweet, may be much more 
wholesome than the pies in common use. 

Of course the most wholesome kind of pie crust is that made with 
cream. Very good crust can be made by the use of cold, rich cream, 
but it is not quite so tender as crust made with a free fat, because 
it does not contain so large a proportion of fat. To a cream crust 
I see no objection from the standpoint of wholesomeness and digesti- 
bility, if the cream used is free from objections. 

GENERAL STATEMENTS AND POINTS TO BE 

REMEMBERED 

Pastry, or winter-wheat, flour, which contains a larger proportion 
of water than spring-wheat flour, should always be used. 

The water used in mixing the pastry should be ice-cold or the 
coldest obtainable. 

The ingredients for the pastry should be put together with as little 
mixing as possible, and should never be kneaded. 

Pie crust made with oil should be mixed with a spoon, not with 
the hands. 

Pastry made with oil must be softer than that made with a hard 
fat, so soft that it cannot be handled in the same way thai t\5A Vj^^^-^

can be handled. More flour must be used on the board and more 
sprinkled on top of the dough when rolling it out. No attempt should 
be made to turn the crust over or to move it. Continue to roll It 
without changing its position until it is of the desired shape and 
thickness. 

Take half the dough and put it in the flour on the board; sprinkle 
flour over the dough, pat it into a ball, then begin to roll it with 
the rolling pin. At first allow the pin to rest only lightly on the 
dough, and roll always toward the edge of the dough, lifting the pin 
up after each motion from the center toward the edge, never rolling 
from the edge toward the center. Keep the edge rolled thinner than 
the center, and make the strokes on such parts of the dough as will 
keep the dough in as nearly a circular form as possible. The crust 
which is trimmed off after the dough is put on the plate may be 
pressed into a ball with the rest of the dough, to be rolled out for 
the top crust. 

The thinner the crust is rolled, the better the pie. No one likes 
a pie in which the crust is the most prominent part. The filling 
should be the prominent part, with something thin, crisp, and dainty 
— scarcely noticeable in any other way — to inclose it. 

To get the crust on the pie plate after it is rolled, run a spatula 
or limber-bladed knife under the crust to loosen it from the board; 
double it over; lay it over one half of the plate, and then unfold it. 
Press it close to the plate in the angle between the side and the bot- 
tom of the plate. If it is to be a one-crust pie, like a custard pie. 
cut the crust about one-half inch beyond the edge of the plate, and 
with floured thumbs and fingers, double and pinch up this portion 
to make a built-up edge. Then, if desired, with the thumb and fore- 
finger of the right hand and the forefinger of the left, scallop the 
edge. 

If the pie is to have two crusts, cut the bottom crust off even 
with the edge of the pie tin. Put the filling into the crust. Roll 
out the rest of the pastry for the top, and cut small holes through 
this crust; these holes may be in the shape of some fancy figure. 
With a small brush wet the edge of the bottom crust with cold water, 
run a spatula under the crust on the board, double it over, and lay 
it over one half of the pie, and unfold it. Press down the edge firmly 
all around the plate, then cut oft* the crust even with the edge of the 
plate. 

To bake the crust of a one-crust pie before putting in the filling, 
lay the crust over the 'bottom of an inverted pie tin, cut the edge off 
even with the edge of the plate, prick holes in the crust, and set in 
the oven to bake. After the crust is baked, remove it from the tin 
and set it inside the plate. 

It is not necessary to oil pie tins. Pies will not stick to the 
plate unless the filling runs under the crust; and if that occurs, oil- 
ing the tin will not prevent the sticking. 



PIES 179 

To make the top of the upper crust flaky, after rolling the crust 
out brush it with oil, using a small paint brush; sift a little flour 
over the oil, and roll it once with the rolling pin; cut holes in the 
crust, and put it on the pie; then, just before putting the pie in the 
oven, run cold water over the top crust. After the pie is baked, 
that top layer of flour will appear as flakes on the top of the crust. 

No spice is needed in pies, as it disguises the real flavor of the 
filling. 

Left-over pastry may be cut into strips . or squares and baked. 
Use like crackers. 

PROPORTIONS FOR FRUIT PIES 

The following are the proportions of fruit, sugar, and flour in 
fruit pies: 

Apple. — % quart sliced tart apples, ^/s teasppon salt, M> cup sugar, 

2 tablespoons water. Some persons add a little flour to apple pies. 
I prefer to omit the flour. 

Blueberry. — % quart berries, lU teaspoon salt, V-> cup sugar, 3 
tablespoons flour. 

Cherry. — % quart stoned cherries, Vh teaspoon salt, Y2 to % cup 
sugar, 3 tablespoons flour. 

Green Currant. — % quart currants, % teaspoon salt, 1 cup sugar, 

3 tablespoons flour. Use currants that are just beginning to turn red. 

Gooseberry. — % quart gooseberries, % teaspoon salt, 1 cup sugar, 
Vi cup flour. 

Peach. — % quart si ice 1 fresh peaches, Vs teaspoon salt. V> cup 
sugar, 2 teaspoons flour, cherry or almond and vanilla flavor. 

Raspbeny. — % quart raspberries, ^^ teaspoon salt, % cup sugar, 
3 tablespoons flour. 

Rhubarb, — % quart thinly sliced rhubarb, Vs teaspoon salt, 1 cup 
sugar, % cup flour. Do not peel the rhubarb. 

Strawberry. — % quart strawberries, Ys teaspoon salt, % cup 
sugar, 3 tablespoons flour. 

Green Tomato. — % quart sliced tomatoes, % teaspoon salt, % 
cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour. Use tomatoes that are just beginning 
to turn. 

The secret of having apple pies and green tomato pies taste good 
without, any spice is to bake them slowly for one hour or longer. 

The juice will not run out of fruit pies so badly if the sugar, 
flour, and salt are mixed together,^ then mixed with the fruit before 
putting it Into the crust; and the juice will be less likely to boil out 
if the pies are baked slowly from forty-flve minutes to one hour. 
For the same reason, fruit pies should be made in deep i^le tv\3L^, 



180 GOOD FOOD 

The quantities of fruit given are for a medium-sized pie. For 
a very large pie one quart of fruit will be required, and for a smaller 
pie one pint, with the same proportions of other ingredients. 

Another precaution which may be observed in order that the juice 
may not run out, is not to fill the pie tin too full, perhaps using one 
pint of fruit for a medium-sized tin. But pies with a generous quan- 
tity of filling are usually preferred. Bakers' pies are thin, and 
therefore bakers have little trouble with the juice running out. Or 
instead of a whole top crust, put three-fourths-inch strips of crust, 
lattice-fashion, on top of the pie. Juice will not run out of a pie 
made in this way, because the steam can readily escape. 

RECIPES 

Pie Cnut — No. 1 

(Very tender) 

2% cups sifted pastry flour 

^ teaspoon salt 

% cup oil 

% cup cold water 

Put the flour into a mixing bowl; mix the salt with it; turn the 
oil in all at once, and stir with a spoon till the oil and flour are 
about half mixed, not till a dough is formed. Then pour in the 
water, all at once, and stir till the dough is just stuck together. 
Much mixing makes the pie crust tough. Then proceed according to 
directions for rolling out the crust. 

Pie Crust — No. 2 

(A little less tender, but grood) 

2 cups sifted pastry flour 

^ teaspoon salt 

% cup oil 

^ cup cold water 

Put together in the same manner as crust No. 1. 

Notice that the proportion of ingredients in crust No. 1 is one 
flfth as much oil as flour and one half as much water as oil. 

In crust No. 2 the proportion is one sixth as much oil as flour 
and one eighth as much water as flour. 

Apple Cream Pie 

Line a pie tin with crust, building up a scalloped edge. Fill crust 
with pared, quartered, and cored apples, arranging a row around the 
plate at the edge, then working toward the center till the crust Is 
covered. Then arrange a few more quarters on top of this layer. 
Sprinkle over the apples two-thirds cup sugar with which two and 
one-half level teaspoons flour has been mixed. Cover with rich 
cream, and bake till the apples are tender. 






PIES 181 

Apple and Date Pie 

Line a deep pie plate with crust. Put into it a layer of sliced 
tart apples, and cover with a layer of washed, stoned, and sliced 
dates. Pour over all one-third cup sugar and one-eighth teaspoon 
salt, mixed. Cover with top crust, and bake slowly from forty-flve 
minutes to one hour. Serve with cream. 

Cream Pie 

Perhaps this pie may be considered somewhat extravagant, but 
it is unusually good, and may be used for special occasions: 

4 egg yolks 

% cup sugar 

^ cup flour 
2 tablespoons butter substitute 
1 teaspoon vanilla 

1 pint milk 

A few grains salt 

Mix flour, sugar, and salt. Beat the egg yolks, and stir them and 
the butter substitute and vanilla into the flour and sugar. Heat the 
milk to hoilingy and stir it into the egg mixture. Pour into a crust 
which has a built-up edge, and bake till set. Add a few grains salt 
to the whites of the eggs, and beat them stiff. Fold into them one- 
fourth cup sugar, spread this on top of the pie, and set on the oven 
grate to brown delicately. 

Custard Pie 

Custard pie requires a larger proportion of eggs than cup custard. 

1% cups milk 

2 eggs or three yolks 
% teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons sugar 
1 tablespoon flour 

Grated yellow rind of one lemon 

Beat the eggs and mix with them the sugar, flour, salt, and lemon 
rind. Heat the milk to boiling, and stir it in. Pour into a crust 
cvith a built-up edge, and bake in a hot oven at flrst to cook the 
3rust; afterward decrease the heat, because a custard will separate, 
3r whey, if subjected to too high a temperature. Remove from the 
dven when just set.

1% cups raisins, ground through food chopper with flnest 

cutter, measured after grinding 
3 tablespoons sugar

1/4 pound chopped citron 

1 pint stewed prunes, from which the seeds have been 

removed 

Mix all the ingredients, heat slowly, ^nd cook over a very mod- 
erate heat for several hours, stirring occasionally so that the mixture 
will not scorch, till it turns dark in color. It may then be canned 
like any fruit, and kept till needed. 

Some may prefer a little more sugar than this recipe calls for. 

Three kinds of nuts are used because a sufficient quantity of one 
kind would make the flavor too prominent.

God's Sweetest Gift 

God thought to give the sweetest thing 

In His almighty power 
To Earth; and deeply pondering 

What it should be, one hour 
In fondest joy and love of heart 

Outweighing every other, 
He moved the gates of heaven apart 

And gave to Earth a mother."

A nut cake may be made from this recipe by putting some ot the

coarsely chopped nuts, then adding more cake batter, then more nuts, 
then the rest of the batter. Raisins cut into halves may also he used 
with the nuts.

Two>Enr Cake

Put together like Plain Cake. 

The objection is sometimes made to cakes in which soda or baking 
towder is not used and which are made light by beating air into 
hem, that they are dry and unpalatable compared with cakes made 
n the usual way. The reason they seem dry is because they contain 
10 shortening (fat in some form), which is used in cakes of the or- 
linary kind to make them moist and tender. Cakes made light by 
leating depend for their lightness upon air beaten into the eggs 
rhieh are used in them. Fat of any kind added to the eggs will 
Terent them from catching air and becoming light. Therefore short- 
ning cannot be added to such cakes in the usual way. But it Is 
•osailde to add a little oil to cakes of this kind if it is added at the 
ight time and in the right way, and this makes the cake more 
lolst and more tender. 

The following is a recipe for a cake in which a little oil is used: 

Cake Shortened with Oil 

3 eggs 

^ teaspoon salt 

% cup boiling water 
• 1 cup sugar 
1% cups sifted pastry flour 

% cup cooking oil 
Grated yellow rind of 1 lemon 

Break the eggs into an earthenware mixing bowl, and set the bowl 
n a pan of hot water. Add the salt to the eggs, and beat the eggs 
v'ith a Dover egg beater till they become light and stiff. Beat the 
)oiling water into the eggs and beat again till stiff. Gradually 
)eat in .the sugar, adding it a little at a time, and beating well be- 
ween the additions of sugar, and until the batter is stiff and light 
ind nearly fills a one-and-one-half-quart bowl. Beat in the lemon 
I'ind and the oil. 

Now comes the most particular part of the making of the cake 
— the folding in of the flour. It is easy, if care is not taken, to 
work out all the air that has been beaten into the batter, and the 
air is what is depended upon to make the cake light. A flat wire 
whip is the best utensil to use in folding in the flour. Sift a little 
of the flour over the top of the stiffly beaten batter. Fold it in by 
dipping the whip edgewise down at the side of the bowl and lifting 
it up flatwise through the center. When this flour is partly folded in, 
sift on more flour and fold it in in the same way. Continue folding

flour in until all the flour has been uaed, but do not fold a s'trokt 
more than is necessary to get tbe flour completely blended with the 
batter. 

Pour at once Into a cake tin wblcli has a piece of oiled pmwt 
fitted into tbe bottom. Do not oil tbe aides of the tin. Bake In a 
moderate oven till a broom straw run into the cake comea out clean. 
When the cake la taken from the oven, turn It upside down to coot

Eating Between Meals 

** Eatkng between meals is one of the prevailing evils, especially 
of childhood. It is a dyspepsia-producing habit. If during the proc- 
ess of digestion more food is taken into the stomach, the whole mass 
must be retained until all is digested. By its remaining too long 
in the stomach, germs begin their work, and fermentation and a 
sour stomach are the result. If this habit is indulged, disease is 
inevitable. If children are taught from infancy to take food only at 
regular intervals, this habit is as easy to form as is the one of 
eating six or eight times a day. Water and fruit juice are the only 
things admissible between meals." — ''Home and Health,'' p, 201. 



CAKE ICINGS AND FILLINGS 

Boiled Icing: 

2 egg whites 
1 cup sugar 
1/4 cup water 

Put the sugar and water into a dish which has a closely fitting 
cover, and set it on the stove to boil. Have the egg whites in a 
bowl ready to beat. Boil the sugar and water with the cover off the 
dish till a long, hairlike thread hangs from the spoon when dipped 
into the sirup and lifted, or to 244° F. Set the dish off the stove 
and put the cover on tightly while you beat the whites stiff. Then 
pour the hot sirup in a small stream into the whites, beating con- 
tinuously, and beat till it becomes cool enough and stiff enough to 
spread on the cake without running off. 

If properly made, this will be stiff enough to stay in place, but 
not too stiff to spread smoothly, even if it should take some few min- 
utes to spread it on the cake. 

One et^g white is generally used for one cup of sugar, and the 
sirup boiled to 238° F., but by using two egg whites and boiling the 
sirup a little thicker, an icing is made which will not become too 
hard to spread before it is all spread on the cake. It makes a 
smoother and nicer frosting. 

Ornamental Frosting 

Ornamental frosting is simply the beaten white of eggs and pow- 
dered sugar mixed together, the proportion being about one-fourth 
pound of powdered sugar to one white for the foundation, then more 
sugar is added to make it a little stiff er for the ornamenting. The 
whites of the eggs are beaten, adding a few drops of lemon juice 
when they are partly beaten, then the sifted sugar is added, and the 
mixture is well beaten together. 

If it is desired to put a design on a cake in color, powdered 
sugar may be stirred into a teaspoonful of strawberry juice or cran- 
berry juice till it is stiff enough to hold its shape when put on the 
cake, or powdered sugar may be stirred into the yolk of an egg to 
make a yellow color, or spinach juice may be used to make a green 
color. 

The entire frosting of a cake may be made of fruit juice, such as 
orange, cranberry, strawberry, or pineapple, thickened with powdered 
sugar till it is stiff enough to spread on the cake, or cream and 
powdered sugar may be uaeA.

When It Is desired to put a fancy decoration on a cake, the cake 
la flrst covered with a Bmootb frosting, which is allowed to dry. 
This foundation frosting is made of beaten whites of eggs and pow- 
dered sugar beaten together In the proportion of two egg whites to 
one-half pound ot sugar, a few drops of lemon juice being added to 
the whites when they are beaten. When the foundation is hard, the 
design is drawn on it with a pencil. For the ornamenting, a mixture 
o( egg wliites and powdered sugar similar to that used for the foun- 
dation is used, with a little more sugar added so as to make it Btift 
enough to hold its shape. This mixture is put into an ornamenting 
syringe to which tubes of many different shapes can be attached for 
making various ornaments, such as leaves, flowers, stars, scrolls; and 
by following with this tool the lines drawn on the foundation frost- 
ing with a pencil, the desired design is put on the cake. 

Or a cone of heavy paper can be used instead of the syringe in 
making a design of plain lines.

the bananas and rub them through a colander, and add the orange 
juice to them. Boil the sugar in one-half cup of water to 240° F., 
or till it threads, then beat this sirup into the stiffly beaten egg white. 
While the sugar is boiling, dissolve the gelatin, after being drained

to it sufficient water to make one pint, then stir it into the bananas 
and orange juice. Lastly, fold in the egg white, into which the sirup

apples, or stewed prunes, or stewed dates or figs, or a mixture of 
any two or three of these, may be used for this ice. 



FRUIT CANNING 

The time when fresh fruits, which may be called nature's " health 
foods/' are in season being so short in northern latitudes, it is 
very desirable to preserve them in as nearly a natural state as 
possible. 

Healthful cookery does not include the preserving of foods by 
the use of salt, vinegar, sugar, or chemical preservatives. Any of 
these substances which preserve foods against the attacks of germs, 
preserve them also against the action of the digestive juices. Chem- 
ical preservatives are injurious to health. 

The fermentation and decay of fruits and vegetables are caused 
by germs which are everywhere present. Most of these germs are 
killed by a temperature equal to that of boiling water, if subjected 
to it long enough, and a temperature several degrees below this is 
sufficient to destroy some of them. The secret, then, of canning fruits 
or vegetables is to cook the foods sufficiently long to destroy all germ 
life which they may contain, and to seal them in air-tight receptacles 
while they are so hot that germs cannot live in them. If sealed 
under these conditions, they will keep indefinitely. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

If Mason or Lightning jars are used, see that the covers and rub- 
bers are perfect. The jars may be tested by partly filling them with 
water, putting on the cover, and tightening it, and standing them 
bottom upward for a time before using them. If they leak, there is 
some imperfection that must be remedied. It is hardly safe to use 
rubbers a second time. It is better to buy new ones each season 
than to lose the fruit as well as the time spent in canning it. Mason 
jar covers are sometimes damaged in opening the jars, and should 
be carefully examined before they are used a second time. If there 
seems to be any possibility that they will not properly seal the jars, 
they must be rejected. Of course, the jars must be so thoroughly 
washed that they are perfectly clean. 

The fruit selected for canning should be of first quality, fresh, 
sound, ripe, but not overripe. That which is not good enough to 
use fresh will be liable to spoil if it is canned. Graniteware or 
aluminum kettles should be used, and the fruit should be cooked 
gently, but so thoroughly that all germ life in every part of it will 
be killed. This will require from fifteen minutes to one-half hour, 
nrconiing; to the nature and size of the fruit. 

20(i 



FRUIT CANNING 207 

If the canning is properly done, the addition of sugar is not neces- 
sary to make the fruit keep. When enough sugar is used to " pre- 
serve " the fruit, so that it will keep even though imperfectly canned, 
its wholesomeness is spoiled. Only sufficient sugar should be added 
to make it palatable. After the can is sealed, it should be watched 
for a few days to detect any signs of fermentation. If such appear, 
the fruit may be saved by opening the can and boiling its contents. 
It is best to use such fruit at once, as recanning may not preserve it. 

When using foods that have been canned in tin, always remove 
them from the can as soon as it is opened. This precaution may 
prevent serious poisoning. 

The amount of sugar given in the following recipes is only a 
suggestion. Some may like more, others may think it better to use 
less. The less you use, the better. It is well to cultivate a taste for 
fnuit with little sugar. 

RECIPES 

To Can Strawberries 

Select sound, highly colored fruit, use it, if possible, the day it 
is picked. Wash the berries in cold water, lifting them out of the 
water with the hands, thus allowing any sand or grit to settle to 
the bottom of the pan. Hull the berries; and as they are hulled, 
measure them and put them into a graniteware or aluminum kettle 
or pan. Over each quart of berries sprinkle from one-half to three- 
fourths cup of sugar. Allow the berries to stand overnight. 

In the morning drain off the juice, and put it on the stove to heat. 
When it boils, carefully put the berries into it, and boil them gently 
for fifteen minutes or longer, using a graniteware spoon to keep the 
berries under the sirup, and to remove the scum. 

Have the jars perfectly clean. Put the covers in boiling water. Set 
the jars in a pan of hot water on the stove beside the kettle of boiling 
fruit. Dip the rubbers in melted paraffin and put them on the jars. 
Keep the fruit boiling while the jars are being filled. Put a little fruit 
into two or three jars; this will warm them, and they will be less 
liable to break. Then fill one jar till it begins to run over. See that 
there are no seeds or fruit on the rubber. Remove one of the covers 
from the boiling water, and put it on the jar, tightening it securely. 
Set the jar bottom upward to cool, but not on a cold, wet surface 
or in a draft. If you are using Mason jars, tighten the covers fre- 
quently while the fruit is cooling. If a jar leaks, and cannot be 
securely tightened, its contents must be returned to the kettle, boiled, 
and put into another jar. 

When one jar is sealed, fill another, putting a little fruit into 
each jar a few minutes before it is to be filled. There will be more 
juice than is desirable if the fruit is to be used for sauce, so some 
jars may be filled with fruit and others with juice alone. This may 



208 OOOD FOOD 

be done with all kinds of berries, and thus you will have a good 
supply of a variety of fruit juices! 

Canned fruit should be stored in a dark place, or wrapped in 
paper to keep the light from it, as it loses its color if exposed to 
the light. 

To Can Blackberries, Raspberries, and Other Small Fruits 

Carefully pick over and wash the berries. Use from one-third to 
two-thirds cup of sugar to one quart of fruit. Put the fruit to cook 
in a very small quantity of water. Heat slowly, and boil fifteen 
minutes or longer. Then follow the directions for canning straw- 
berries. 

To Can Peaches 

Select sound, ripe peaches. Wash, divide, stone, and pare them, 
putting them into cold water to prevent discoloration. Place the 
fruit in a kettle, sprinkling each layer with sugar, using one-fourth 
to one-half cup to each quart of peaches, or, if preferred, the sugar 
may be omitted. Add a little boiling water, only sufficient to cook 
the fruit. Heat slowly. Boil fifteen minutes or longer, till the 
peaches are tender. Then follow the directions for canning straw- 
berries. 

Pears and apples may be canned in a similar way. 

To Can Plums 

Prick each plum to prevent its bursting. Use from three-fourths 
to one cup of sugar to each quart of fruit, according to the acidity 
of the plums. Follow the directions for canning other fruit. 

To Can Cherries 

Cherries may be put up whole, like plums, or they may be stoned 
first. Use about one-half cup sugar to one quart of fruit. 

To Make Grape Juice 

Use Concord grapes. Pick them from the stems, rejecting im- 
perfect ones. Wash well, and put them into a graniteware or alumi- 
num kettle. To each three quarts of grapes add one quart of hot 
water. Stew till the skins burst and the pulp is well softened, but 
do not cook too long, for that will give the juice a strong flavor. 
Put the grapes into a bag made of two thicknesses of cheesecloth, and 
hang them up to drain. Allow them to hang till all the juice possible 
has been drained out. This may be bottled as first-quality juice. 
Then squeeze the bag to remove the rest of the juice, which may be 
bottled as second quality. 

To bottle .the juice, add to each quart one-third cup sugar. Boil 
the juice five minutes. Have the bottles thoroughly clean. Set them 
in a pan of hot water beside the kettle of juice. Fill the bottles full 
with the boiling juice. Use corks that will fit tightly, and put them 
}n boiling water to soften them. Remove one of the corks from the 



FHUIT CANNING 209 

boiling water, and put it into the mouth of the bottle right on top 
of the juice. As the juice cools and contracts, press the corks down 
into the bottles. When the corks have been pushed in, seal them by 
dipping the end of the bottle into melted sealing wax or paraffin; or 
if the cork can be pushed in a little below the neck of the bottle, 
fill the bottle above the cork with the melted wax. The juice may 
be put into glass jars, as fruit is canned. 

This juice is about equal parts grape juice and water. If desired 
stronger, add one pint of water to three quarts of grapes. If it is 
desired to bottle the juice pure, crush the grapes, and cook them in 
their own juice till well softened. Then proceed as directed for 
cooking the grapes in water. The juice may be bottled without sugar 
or with from one-third to one-half cup of sugar to the quart of juice. 
This juice may be used pure, or it may be diluted as desired. 

One common-sized basket of grapes makes one and one-half quarts 
of grapes when picked from the stems, and is sufficient for about one 
pint of pure juice. 

To Can Tomatoes 

Tomatoes may be canned as fruit is canned. Have the jars per- 
fectly clean. Put the covers into boiling water. Scald, peel, and slice 
the tomatoes. Put them into a kettle and heat them very gradually 
at first, being careful not to scorch them (they may be put into a 
double boiler at first till the juice is well drawn out). Then cook 
them gently but thoroughly for one hour; simply scalding them will 
not do. Set the jars in a pan of hot water on the stove beside the 
kettle of boiling tomatoes. Dip the rubbers in melted paraffin, and 
place them on the jars. Keep the tomatoes boiling while the jars 
are being filled. Fill the jars till they begin to run over. See that 
there are no seeds on the rubbers. Remove one of the covers from 
the boiling water and put it on the jar. Tighten it securely, and 
set the jar away, bottom up, to cool. If you are using Mason jars, 
tighten the covers frequently as the tomatoes cool. 



" Wherever fruit can be grown in abundance, a liberal supply 
should be prepared for winter, by canning or drying. Small fruits, 
such as currants, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, and black- 
berries, can be grown to advantage in many places where they are 
but little used, and their cultivation is neglected. For household can- 
ning, glass rather than tin cans, should be used wherever possible." 
— " The Ministry of Healing'' 

" The Lord planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he 
put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground made 
the Lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight; and good 
for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden." Gen- 
esis 2: 8, 9.

JELLY MAKING 

Jklliks contain too much sugar to be wholesome if used in more 
than small quantities. They should be treated as confections rather 
than as foods. The health-giving properties of fruit juices are really 
spoiled when made into jelly. However, it may be permissible to 
make a little of a variety of kinds to be used as a dainty or titbit 
or as an accompaniment of protein foods, which seem to require as 
a sauce something that is stimulating to the stomach; and jellies in 
small quantities may have a peptogenlc effect. 

The property that fruit juices have of setting Into a jelly after 
being boiled, is due to the presence of pectose. The juices of some 
fruits contain a sufficient amount of this substance so that they may 
be made into jelly without the addition of sugar; while others, like 
peaches and cherries, contain so little that they cannot be made into 
a firm jelly even with sugar. Pectose Is a carbohydrate substance 
similar to starch or dextrin. Fruits contain pectose in largest 
amount when just ripe, and their jelly-making qualities deteriorate 
with age; therefore overripe fruit should not be chosen for making 
jelly. The skins and cores of the fruit should be used, because these 
contain a larger proportion of pectose than the flesh of the fruit. 
Jelly can be made from peelings that are left after preparing fruit 
for sauce or canning. 

The purpose of boiling jelly is to allow the moisture to .evaporate, 
so it should be boiled in a granlteware or aluminum kettle large 
enough so that the sirup will be shallow. 

Add the sugar to the juice, heat slowly, and boll to the proper 
density as tested by dropping a little on a cold plate, skimming off 
any froth that rises. 

Apple Jelly 

Wash and quarter or slice nice tart apples, but unless wormy, 
do not remove the cores. Put them into a granlteware or aluminum 
kettle, and add sufficient cold water to come nearly to the top of the 
apples. Cook slowly till the apples are thoroughly softened. Turn 
into a jelly bag and allow to drain. When all the juice has drained 
out that will do so without pressure, measure the juice, use three 
fourths as much sugar as juice, and proceed according to the general 
directions given. The remainder of the juice may be squeezed out 
of the jelly bag, which will make a second-quality jelly. 

It is convenient to test the jelly with a thermometer. When the 
sirup has reached a temperature of 222° F., it is boiled sufficiently.

3 cups cranberries 

1 Clip boiling water 

1^ Clips sugar 
Cook the cranberries In the water till tender. Rub tbem tbrougb 
a fine colander. This should make one pint of pulp. Put tbls pulp 
on the stove to beat, and put the sugar Into the oven to heat. When 
the fruit bolls, add the hot sugar to it. Allow it to boil up. Skim 
and pour Into jelly glasses or molds wet In cold water. A clearer 
Jelly may be made by putting the fruit, after It is cooked. Into a 
Jelly bag and allowing the juice to drain out. Measure this juice. 
Use three fourths as much sugar as you have Juice, and proceed as 
before. The pulp which remains may be rubbed through a fine col- 
ander, sweetened, and used as sauee or marmalade. 

Cnrrmnt J«ilT 

Pick over and wash the currants. Put them Into a kettle, crushing 
them to extract sufficient juice to start them cooking. Heat slowly. 
and boil till well softened. Drain and proceed as in making apple 
jelly. 

Raspberry jelly is made in the same way. Equal parts of cur- 
rants and raspberries make a better jelly than either alone. It may 
be necessary to boll this Jelly higher than 222^ F. 




BEVERAGES 



Dbinks should be taken between meals. A large quantity of 
liquid taken at meals dilutes the gastric ju|ee and delays digestion. 
Food should not be " washed down/' for it is then not well masti- 
cated and mixed with the saliva, which is the first digestive fluid. If 
liquid is taken at mealtime, it should be sipped between the mouth- 
fuls of food, which should be chewed until it is reduced to a liquid. 

UNWHOLiESOMK DRINKS 

Iced drinks should not be taken at meals, for they cool the con- 
tents of the stomach to a temperature at which digestion is checked. 
In fact, it is questionable whether iced drinks are ever entirely 
harmless. 

Tea and coffee contain two harmful substances, tannin and caf- 
fein. Tannin has a tanning, or astringent, effect upon the lining of 
the stomach and upon albuminous foods. It interferes with salivary 
and stomach digestion. 

Caffein is one hundred times as deadly a poison as alcohol. This 
will account for the statement made by Dr. D. H. Kress, " Tea is 
worse than beer." 

One pound of average tea contains 252 grains of caffein. Twenty 
grains of caffein is sufficient to kill a man. In one pound of tea 
there is sufficient poison to kill twelve men, two rabbits, and four- 
teen frogs. 

One cup of tea contains from one and one-half to one and three- 
fourths grains of caffein, and three or four grains of tannin. There- 
fore it takes a little more than twelve cups of tea to contain a 
deadly dose of caffein. 

A cup of coffee contains the same amount of caffein and tannin 
as a cup of tea. 

Sleeplessness, stomach trouble, palpitation of the heart, head- 
ache, constipation, nervous disorders, arterial and kidney diseases, 
and liver trouble are some of the diseases caused by the use of tea 
and coffee. 

Tea and coffee blunt the sensibilities and make those who use 
them oblivious of consequences. This is the reason that a cup of 
tea will make a tired woman feel equal to doing a big washing on 
Monday morning. 

Tea is more powerful to keep people awake than opium is to 
put them to sleep.

Dr. Alexander Bryce, in " Modern Theories of Diet," page 152, 
says, " Tea, coffee, and cocoa are nerve poisons, cardiac poisons, and 
cerebral excitants." 

Water is the natural and perfect beverage. The next best drink 
is fruit juice. The nutritive constituents in fruit juices are pre- 
digested, and the mineral salts they contain are medicinal; so that 
fruit juices are not only delicious beverages, but the Creator's 
natural medicines, blood purifiers, and tonics. 

RECIPES 

Cer«al Coffee 

Use one slightly rounded tablespoon of cereal coffee for each cup 
of water. Simmer twenty minutes. It is well to put the coffee In 
a cheesecloth bag, then it is not necessary to strain the coffee. 
Serve with cream and sugar. Care should be taken not to use too 
much sugar with cereal coffee because it spoils its coffee flavor and 
makes it liable to cause biliousness. 

Lemonade 

1/4 lemon 
2 tablespoons sugar 
Cold water 

After squeezing the lemon juice, strain it into a' glass. Add the 
sugar and sufficient cold water to fill the glass. When the sugar is 
dissolved, it is ready to serve. 

Lemonade, Larse Quantity 

1 quart water 

Juice of 3 large or 4 small lemons 
% cup sugar 

If use4 for medicinal purposes, as in fever or in connection with 
treatment to ward off a cold, it would be better to use less sugar. 

Raspberry Nectar

A Voice from the Corn 

" I WAS made to be eaten, not to be drank, 
To be thrashed in a barn, not soaked in a tank; 
I come as a blessing when put in a mill, 
As a blight and a curse when run through a still; 
Make me up into loaves, and your children are fed; 
But made into drink, I will starve them instead. 
In bread I'm a servant, the eater shall rule; 
In drink I'm a master, the drinker a fool. 
Then remember my warning; my strength Til employ,- 
If eaten, to strengthen; if drunk, to destroy." 



INVALID COOKERY 

WiuLK many of the foregoing recipes may be used for the sick, 
such as broths, milk preparations, egg preparations, toasts, breads, 
fruits, and fruit juices, the liquid foods given in this section will be 
found of special value where the more solid foods cannot be taken. 

Special mention should be made of the health-giving properties 
of fruit juices. They are tonics and blood purifiers, and contain 
nourishment all ready for assimilation. There are few if any dis- 
ease germs that can live in pure lemon juice. Apple juice will 
destroy the germs of Asiatic cholera. Blueberry juice will destroy 
the germs of typhoid fever. Other valuable fruit juices are orange 
juice, grape juice, and pineapple juice. 

The diet of the sick should consist of articles which will impose 
only a light tax on the digestive powers, but at the same time they 
should not be lacking in nourishment; and they should be made as 
appetizing and attractive as possible. 

Hot foods should be hot but not too hot, and cold foods should 
be cold but not too cold, when they reach the patient. 

Scrupulous neatness and care are required in cooking for, and 
serving food to, the sick. Some seemingly trivial, careless act may 
be sufficient to take away the little appetite the patient may have. 
The tray on which the food is served should be covered with a clean 
white napkin, and the silverware should be bright. If there are in 
the home dainty china and pretty little glass dishes, this is the time 
to put them to good service. If possible, broth should be served in 
a thin, light cup, partly filled; milk and fruit juices, in a thin, light 
glass. The bread should be sliced thin. The toast should be thin and 
crisp, crackers and ready-cooked cereal foods freshly toasted, the 
fresh fruit cut and arranged in some new and unexpected way. A 
straw placed in a cold drink may make it more palatable. A sprig 
of leaves, a fiower, a quotation from Scripture, or a pretty verse 
may bring pleasure. 

RECIPES 

Oatmeal Gruel 

i/{ cup rolled oats 
1 pint water 
1 pint or more hot milk 
11/4 teaspoons salt 

Add the salt to the water, and bring to a boil in the inner cup 
of a double boiler. Stir in the rolled oats. Boil over the fire two or 



216 GOOD FOOD 

three minutes, then set the inner cup in the outer cup of the double 
boiler which contains boiling water, and continue the cooking for 
three hours or longer. Then rub the oatmeal through a strainer. 
Add hot milk to make of the proper consistency for gruel. 

Barley gruel, cornmeal gruel, or rice gruel may be made by the 
same recipe, using one-third cup pearl barley, one-fourth cup corn- 
meal, or one-fourth cup rice, instead of the rolled oats. And in mak- 
ing cornmeal or rice gruel one hour's cooking of the cereal is suffi- 
cient. It may be necessary to cook the barley four or five hours. 

It may sometimes be desirable to make the gruel entirely of water. 

Barley Water 

'/4 cup pearl barley 
2 quarts cold water 

Thoroughly wash the barley, and let it soak in cold water for 
one hour or longer, then put it to cook in the two quarts of cold 
water. Let it come to a boil, and simmer slowly till reduced to one 
pint of liquid. Strain oH the broth. Season with salt, reheat, and 
serve plain, or seasoned with a little cream. 

One-fourth cup raisins or figs cut into dice may be cooked with 
the barley if desired, or a little lemon rind may be used and the 
broth sweetened with a little sugar. 

Rice Water 

^/4 cup rice 
1 quart cold water 

The so-called ** natural brown " rice, or rice from which the bran 
has not been removed, is best for this. 

Wash the rice thoroughly by whipping it in hot water with a 
batter whip and turning off the water several times, then put the 
rice to cook in the cold water. Heat to boiling, and simmer slowly 
till the liquid is reduced to one pint. Strain off the broth, season 
with salt, and with cream if desired. Reheat and serve. 

Gluten Gruel 

1 pint boiling water 
% cup gluten meal 
^ teaspoon salt 

Stir the gluten into the boiling water, simmer till thickened, and 

add the salt. 

Cream Gluten Gruel 

1 cup boiling water 

1 cup milk or thin cream 

^/4 cup gluten meal 

^ teaspoon salt 

Stir the gluten into the boiling water. Cook till thickened, add 
the milk, and heat to boiling.

Toasted Flake Gruel 

Cook one cup of corn flakes or wheat flakes in one cup of water 
till thoroughly softened. Rub through a fine strainer, add a little 
hot cream or milk, and salt to season. 

Hot Malted Milk 

Put one-fourth cup of malted milk in a glass. Moisten it with 
enough hot water to make a smooth paste, then add boiling water 
to fill the glass three fourths full, stirring with a fork till the milk 
is dissolved. 

Hot MUk 

Hot milk that has been freshly heated but not boiled makes a 
nutritious drink for a sick person. 

Albumen Water 

1 egg white 

Vj cup cold water 
A few grains salt 

Beat the egg white till foamy. Add the water, and beat the water 
and white together. Strain through cheesecloth. Add a few grains 
of salt. A little lemon juice may be added if desired. 

Egrirnos: 

2 egg whites 

A few grains salt 

1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

2 tablespoons sugar 

1 teaspoon egg yolk 

Add the salt to the whites, and beat them stiff. Beat in the lemon 
juice and sugar. Save out about one tablespoon of the beaten white. 
Beat the egg yolk into the remainder, and put it into a glass. On 
top put the egg white that was saved out. 

Part of the mixture may be colored with any kind of fruit juice, 
as grape, raspberry, blackberry, or orange, if desired. Or a few- 
fresh or stewed raspberries or a little diced orange may be stirred 
into it. The eggnog looks pretty if the ingredients are not thor- 
oughly stirred together, but left so that some of the white and some 
of the yellow and some of the color of the fruit show. 

Cream Efrfrnog: 

2 eggs 

2 tablespoons cream 

A little sugar, if desired 

Beat the whites and yolks separately. Add the cream to the 
yolks. Put most of the beaten white into the glass. Pour the yolk 
mixture over it so that it will run down around the white. Put the

rest of the white on top. IF the sugar Is used, part of It should be 
beaten into the white and the rest into the yolk mixture. A little 
vanilla flavoring may be added to this If desired.
