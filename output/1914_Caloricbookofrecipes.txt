INTRODUCTION 



THE recipes, explanations and directions, together 
with a number of useful hints and suggestions per- 
taining to the culinary art, contained in this volume 
have been prepared for the benefit of users of the 
Caloric Fireless Cookstove. It should, perhaps, be 
explained here that the word "fireless" is a misnomer. The 
proper word is "recalorator," which literally means conserver 
of heat, just as "refrigerator" means conserver of cold. In 
both instances, the initial calor (heat) and frigor (cold) must 
be provided. 

In the "hay-box," the predecessor of the Caloric Cook- 
stove, the initial heat was supplied by a large body of water or 
liquid in which the food to be cooked was placed and brought 
to the boiling point. The insulation of hay kept the heat 
from dissipating into the surrounding atmosphere, just as the 
charcoal and air chamber insulation of thp refrigerator keep 
the surrounding warmer air from rapidly melting the ice. For 
boiling, steaming (to a certain extent) and stewing, the boiling 
liquid or water was adequate to complete the cooking. But, of 
course, the temperature could not be raised above two hundred 
and twelve degrees Fahrenheit. Inasmuch as there are cer- 
tain foods which cannot be cooked properly by boiling or 
stewing in a liquid, the primitive "hay-box" and its commercial 
successor, the original Caloric Fireless Cookstove, were not 
real cookstoves — they could neither bake or roast. To supply 
this deficiency comes the modern Caloric, which with its genu- 
ine steatite radiators, furnishes sufficient stored heat to raise

the temperature in the Caloric insulated oven to over four hun* 
dred degrees Fahrenheit. Inasmuch as the baking heat is only 
between three hundred and twenty-five and three hundred and 
fifty degrees, it will be readily appreciated that the modern 
Caloric really does BAKE and ROAST, as well as boil, steam 
and stew — literally cooking practically everything for the 
table. That this method of cooking is superior in results, from 
every standpoint, we need not explain — it is too well under- 
stood. 

The first requisite is to acquaint one's self thoroughly with 
the modern Caloric. Therefore, we request all housewives 
to study carefully the directions for its use. 

Although the time and ingredients required for cooking 
are stated, nevertheless, a little experience will demonstrate 
that these may be regulated according to the tastes of the 
individual. It will take a little time for the thoughtful house- 
wife to master all the advantages of the Caloric. There are 
countless possibilities, not mentioned in this book, which time 
and practice will reveal. 

Pains have been taken to make the book international in 
its scope and, in so far as possible, to please the varied tastes. 
It should be understood at the beginning, however, that any 
recipe may be used in preparing food to be cooked in the 
Caloric. After some practice and by following the instructions 
in this book, any woman will be able to prepare whatsoever 
viands she may desire. It is the purpose of this book to set 
forth, principally, the method of preparing food. Formerly 
many ingredients were added to the food while cooking, but 
all the details may now be attended to before the food is 
placed in the Caloric.

EXCLUSIVE CALORIC FEATURES 

It Will Bake and Roast as well as steam, stew and boil. No 
preheating of foods necessary, — no basting, — no waste 
of food stuffs. Never burns, never fails. 

Caloric Cases. In keeping with every modern kitchen conven- 
ience, the "Caloric is substantially constructed of se- 
lected oak, the paneled case making it indestructible, giv- 
ing it an up-to-date air which every housekeeper appre- 
ciates and enjoys. 

Caloric Insulation Fireproof. The acknowledged superior 
efficiency of the Caloric is in a great measure due to 
the use of our patented insulating materials — for re- 
taining the heat in the cooking compartment. Caloric 
insulation is guaranteed fireproof. 

Caloric Ventilating Valve regulates the moist or dry heat in 
the cooking compartment of the Caloric Fireless Cook- 
stove. This is a distinguishing feature of the Caloric. 
Insist on a ventilating valve when you buy a fireless 
cookstove. For Roasting and Baking, to insure dry 
heat, slightly raise the cap from the top of the valve 
allowing free escape of all steam. For Steaming, Stew- 
ing or Boiling, the valve is self -regulating. 

Caloric Radiators from the soap stone ledges of Virginia ab- 
sorb and radiate more heat than any other mineral or 
composition known to science. They cost several times 
as much as iron or steel but they are efficient.

Easy and Simple to Operate. The radiators supplying the 
necessary heat for "Caloric" cooking are heated for 
a few minutes over an ordinary flame (same as a flat 
iron), then placed in the oven — the aluminum utensils 
containing the foods are placed on top of the radiators. 
Close and latch the cover — the "Caloric" will do the rest. 
Simple, isn't it? 

Caloric Cabinets. Substantially constructed of selected solid 
oak finished to match the Caloric Cookstove provides a 
convenient place for the storage of all cooking utensils 
and raises the stove to a proper height. 

Caloric Stove Bases. An inexpensive, strong and well con- 
structed base for use in connection with Caloric Fire- 
less Cookstoves raising the stove to a proper height and 
castered so that it can be conveniently moved from 
place to place. 

The CALORIC Cabinets and Stove Bases are made in 
various sizes to fit any past or present model CALORIC 
Fireless Cookstove. 

Caloric Special Equipment. We can furnish Pure Aluminum 
Bread Pans, Pie Pans, plain and mountain Cake Pans, 
made special for Caloric users. 

Triple Nesting Utensils — Aluminum. Double Boilers in two 
sizes — 4 quart and 8 quart — are regularly in stock, 
ready for immediate shipment.

PART I 
DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE CALORIC 

The principle of fireless cooking, as exemplified by the 
Caloric Cookstove, is that of recaloration, or the retention, 
through insulation, of heat previously generated. In cooking, 
ordinarily, food is heated to a certain temperature ; then it is 
left over the fire, not to get hotter — that would be impossible 
— but to keep it at that degree of heat. The dissipation of heat 
in the surrounding air makes it necessary to keep on supply- 
ing heat in order that the cooking food may continue at the 
cooking temperature. A method was long sought, for hygienic 
as well as economic reasons, by which the heat energy once 
generated, might be conserved without having to add con- 
stantly thereto. Such a method is hygienic, because it is ad- 
mitted that food cooked in a comparatively even temperature 
is not only more nutritious, but also more palatable than that 
cooked fiercely over, on or in the hottest possible temperature. 
The Caloric was the first to utilize this principle in the mak- 
ing of a commercial fireless cookstove. Now, the Caloric 
has made another great stride forward, in the evolution of the 
new Seamless Aluminum Lined Caloric, which has literally 
perfected the art of fireless cooking, not alone in the boiling, 
steaming and stewing features, but it has also rendered pos- 
sible baking and roasting as well. Of course, for baking and 
roasting, some heat must first be placed in the compartment, 
and this is done by means of steatite radiators. With this 

15 



16 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

heat the new Caloric economically and satisfactorily accom- 
plishes practically everything which is possible on a range 
or any other stove. 

IMPORTANT DONT'S 

Don't expect the impossible of the Caloric — that is, abso- 
lute success every time it is used. Failures have occurred in 
using a costly range when the wind was in the wrong direction 
and the drafts would not work well, or when something was 
overlooked; but these failures did not cause discouragement 
or the condemnation of the range. Please give the Caloric an 
equal chance. 

Don't leave the radiators in the oven after the cooking is 
finished. 

Don't fail to dry them thoroughly before reheating. 

Don't try to cook small portions in a large oven, except 
as directed under "Important Things To Do." 

Don't use too much water in Caloric cooking. Not much 
is needed. A tablespoonful is often sufficient. 

Don't blame the Caloric if directions are not followed. 

Don't blame the Caloric if the radiators are not heated 
enough. Some things naturally require more heat than others. 

Don't scrape the aluminum parts with a knife, wire 
cleaner, or other sharp instrument. 

Don't use lye, ashes, or any washing powder or soap con- 
taining alkali. 

Don't allow salt water to come in contact with the Alum- 
inum Metal Parts. 

Don't fail to scald the Caloric occasionally. 

Don't buy any cooker that has seams in the sides and 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 17 

bottoms. They are sure to open up and leak steam and water 
into the insulation. 

Don't buy any Cooker that is not guaranteed fire proof. 

Don't fail to write us for information — we maintain an in- 
formation bureau for your benefit. 

Don't put the hot radiators directly on the bottom of the 
Terneplate or Enamel Lined Caloric's — ^use an Asbestos Mat or 
bottom ring furnished for that purpose. 

Don't fail to read and study the Illustrations showing the 
"Caloric" Methods of cooking and the proper arrangement of 
the cooking compartments. 

IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO 
Read and Study— "Caloric Cooking Illustrated" 

Keep the stove open when not in use. 

Keep the radiators dry by placing them on a hot air regis- 
ter, a steam radiator, or in a place where the sun will strike 
them. 

Radiators will absorb cold as well as heat and in the win- 
ter time, when they become thoroughly chilled, they should be 
heated slowly at first or they will be liable to crack. 

If the radiators become moist in long processes of cooking 
as in the case of cooking cereals, etc., they should be thor- 
oughly dried before reheating them for further use. 

The linings of the compartments must be kept dry. When 
cooking is finished, wipe and dry thoroughly. Use scalding 
water for washing and wipe them off occasionally with a cloth 
moistened with olive oil. 

In cooking a small portion of food, the smallest utensil 
should be used. If there is considerable space left in the com- 
partment, fill another utensil with hot water and place it in the 



18 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

oven at the same time, thereby leaving less air to be heated. 
In an instance of this kind, it is of great advantage to have a 
set of triple or double utensils. One or two may be used for 
cooking foods and the others filled with hot water. 

THE METAL PARTS 

The Caloric Cookstove may have been standing closed for 
a considerable length of time before its receipt by a purchaser 
and for this reason, the linings should be thoroughly washed 
with clean water and soap, or scalded with boiling water. They 
should then be wiped perfectly dry and the covers allowed to 
stand open for several hours, in order that the compartments 
may be thoroughly aired. After each use of the Caloric, it 
should be washed clean and zviped dry. The covers should be 
allowed to stand open when the cookstove is not in use. If 
they are tightly closed when the Caloric is not in use, the lack 
of air may cause the cookstove to give off a musty odor and 
this odor may sometimes be imparted to delicate foods. It is 
well understood that a room or a house when closed up tightly 
becomes musty and the same is true of the Caloric in a greater 
degree because the metal compartments are practically air 
tight. A good housekeeper does not put away cooking utensils 
with the covers on them as they would not keep sweet under 
such conditions. 

When convenient the cookstove should have a thorough 
airing out of doors at least once a week. If it is not convenient 
to do this, the stove should be placed in front of a window, 
where the sun may shine in the ovens. 

When cooking, the utensil covers and the steatite radia- 
tors must be properly in place before any attempt is made to 



CALORIC BOOK OR RECIPES 19 

shut the covers of the stove. Otherwise, the metal may be 
dented. 

It should be remembered that the action of heat and 
steam in the Caloric stoves is very severe. Therefore, the 
metal lining cannot be expected to remain bright. The heat 
from the radiators will darken it. The chemical action of 
acids in some foods will discolor any metal, no matter what 
it is. This discoloration in no way affects the cleanliness of 
the stove, hence no attempt should be made to keep the lin- 
ing bright by scouring it with gritty soaps or powders. Such 
a proceeding will scratch the surface of the metal and may, 
eventually, start rust or corrosion. The oven in an ordinary 
range does not remain perfectly bright and the Caloric oven 
should not be expected to do so. Water or moisture should 
NEVER be allowed to stand in the metal compartments. 

THE HEATING OF RADIATORS 

The steatite radiators may be heated on gas, gasoline, 
denatured alcohol, oil, electric, coal or wood stoves or ranges. 
Care should be taken that the radiators are not allowed to 
become red hot. 

The time required to give the radiators the necessary 
temperature is from ten to twenty minutes, depending, of 
course, on the size and intensity of the blaze used and the 
amount of heat required. Much less heat is needed for baking 
a cake than for roasting a large piece of meat. Judgment must 
be used. The radiators should be tested as one would test a 
sad-iron, or test with paper as illustrated and described in 
illustrations "Caloric Cooking Illustrated." For boiling and 
steaming, only moderate heat is required, while for roasting 
meat it is necessary to have the radiators very hot. 



20 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

With very little trouble, considerable fuel and time may 
be saved by keeping the radiators moderately warm. In the 
summer time they may be placed out of doors in the sun, if 
convenient. They will then require only a few minutes' heat- 
ing over a flame. In the winter they may be placed in a 
window where the sun will strike them ; or better still, on the 
back of a range or a heater. If an asbestos plate, such as is 
used with an ordinary gas stove, is placed over the radiators, 
they will heat more quickly. 

Caloric steatite radiators are as good an absorbent of cold 
as they are of heat. When a radiator is cold it should be 
heated gradually until thoroughly warm and then it may be 
subjected to the most intense heat. 

Steatite is a natural product and contains seams which 
may open up when the radiators are heated. The radiators 
may also chip or flake. This does not affect their utility in 
any way Avhatsoever. If they break or crack into — the parts 
may be cemented together without in any way impairing their 
usefulness or efficiency. On the contrary, a seam or crack will 
cause a radiator to heat up more readily, thereby lessening 
the expenditure for fuel. The Caloric guarantee does not 
cover the chipping or cracking of radiators. 

If they become greasy or soiled, they may easily be made 
as good as new by the use of sand paper or any scouring 
soap. 




CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 21 

CARE OF CALORIC UTENSILS 

Seamless Pure Aliuninum. 

The Caloric utensils are made of pure 
aluminum and, as is well known, this 
material will discolor under certain con- 
ditions. As a rule, hot water and pure 
soap will keep utensils in perfect condi- 
tion, but if these are not sufficient, the 
vessels may easily be cleaned with some 
good scouring soap. Water or food con- 
Double Boiler Made taining alkali or iron will discolor the 
in Two Sizes — 4 inside of aluminum utensils. Among the 
^ ^^ ^ foods which contain alkali are potatoes, 

from which the skins have not been removed ; corn on the cob, 
etc., and these are quite sure to discolor the aluminum utensils. 
This discoloration is harmless and will have no effect 
upon the food. It does, however, mar the appearance of 
the aluminum and every good housekeeper likes to have her 
utensils bright and clean. If food or grease adheres to the 
aluminum surface it may easily be soaked loose by allowing 
hot water to stand in the vessel for several hours and scrap- 
ing with a wooden spoon ; or if necessary, with very fine 
sand or powdered emery. 

BOILING, STEAMING AND STEWING 
Use of Ventilating Valve 
Steaming is the cooking of food over boiling water or in 
molds placed in a kettle of boiling water. 

Stewing is the cooking of food for a considerable time in 
water just below the boiling point. For stewing, the radiators 
need not be quite as hot as for boiling. 



22 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

The Caloric ventilating valve is self-regulating for steam- 
ing, stewing and boiling. 

For boiling, steaming or stewing, only one radiator is 
used. This should be heated and placed in the bottom of 
the compartment. The food, when prepared, should be 
placed, with the proper amount of boiling water, in one 
of the Caloric utensils and the cover clamped down. The 
cover to the Caloric compartment should then be quickly 
closed and fastened. 

The length of time food will keep hot in the Caloric de- 
pends largely on the bulk. When a kettle is two-thirds or 
more full the contents will often keep hot eighteen or twenty 
hours. Food will retain the heat at least ten hours. 

As there is pratically no evaporation of water by escap- 
ing steam, care should be taken not to add too much water 
to foods which absorb water, like lima beans, rice, macaroni, 
etc. In boiling meats, allow only as" much water as will be 
needed for the gravy. For green peas, add one tablespoon- 
ful of water to one pint of peas. With spinach, no water is 
needed except what clings to the leaves after rinsing. Onions 
and dried beans should be placed in cold water and brought to 
the boiling point on a flame stove or range ; then drained, and 
enough fresh water added to cover them. When hot, place 
in the Caloric. 

If a radiator is hot enough to sharply hiss when touched 
with a wet finger, it is hot enough for boiling.

ROASTING 



23 




Showing the Use of 

Caloric Steatite 

Radiator 



Two steatite radiators are used for 
baking and roasting, one at the bottom 
of the oven, and one suspended in a 
rack in place of the regular cover of 
the large utensil. As liquids evapor- 
ate but little in the Caloric, none need 
be added to the roast.. For this rea- 
son, no basting is required. The top 
radiator supplies the necessary heat for 
browning roast. 

It requires only a little more time 
to roast in the Caloric than in an ordi- 
nary oven. For instance, a veal roast that would require 
three-quarters of an hour in an ordinary oven will be roasted 
most satisfactory in the Caloric in one hour. It does not in- 
jure the roast, however, if it is permitted to remain longer in 
the Caloric. It will not bum or become dry or tasteless if left 
for twice or three times the period actually required for 
cooking. 

Season meat as desired and place, without heating or 
adding any water, in the Caloric kettle. If potatoes or other 
vegetables are desired with the meat, place them around it. 
When roasting, raised the cap of the ventilating valve slight- 
ly, allowing free escapement of steam. Radiators for roast- 
ing meat must be very hot. Test them by placing a small 
piece of paper on them; if the paper browns, they are suffi- 
ciently heated, or as directed in "Caloric Cooking Illustrated" 
—Carefully follow the illustrated directions — showing the 



24 



CALORIC BOOK OR RECIPES 



arrangement of the Cooking Compartment for Roasting and 
Baking. 

BAKING 




Baking naturally requires more care- 
ful attention than roasting, but the 
results are most satisfactory and sur- 
. prising. Practically everything can be 
baked in the Caloric — cakes, pastry, 
biscuits, bread, puddings, beans, pota- 
toes, apples and all kinds of fruit. A 
little attention at first, some practice, 
and success is assured. 

Two radiators are used in baking 
and these may be heated while prepar- 
ing the food for the oven. With two 
radiators sizzling hot it requires only about the same time to 
bake as would be necessary in an ordinary range oven with a 
moderate baking heat. A little experience will determine just 
the necessary time. One radiator is placed at the bottom and 
the other on top of the baking rack. Potatoes, or squash in 
the shell, may be put directly into the utensil, but pies, pud- 
dings, cakes, etc., should be placed in the ordinary baking tins 
and sHpped into the racks. Anything too large for the baking 
racks may be put into the regular Caloric utensil as 
directed for meat-roasting. For baking bread or cake heat 
and test the radiators as directed for Baking. 

Again refer to "Caloric Cooking Illustrated." Note the 
arrangement of the cooking compartment for baking pies, 
cakes, etc. 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 25 

The Caloric self-regulating Ventilating Valve allows all 
excess steam to escape, insuring a rich golden brown crust 
on pies, cakes, etc., etc. In fifteen minutes, bread should 
have begun to brown. Pies require hotter radiators than 
bread or cake. In baking Irish potatoes it is neces- 
sary to raise the cap of the ventilating valve to allow the 
steam to escape. Sweet potatoes contain less water than 
Irish potatoes and less steam is formed in baking. 

SUGGESTIONS 

If dinner is to be served at night all the preliminary cook- 
ing may be done at noon, and the food placed in the Caloric 
nnd left until evening. 

Dried apples or prunes may be cooked in the Caloric 
over night. Previous to cooking they should be soaked in cold 
water several hours. Use the water in which they were 
soaked for the cooking. 

Sauerkraut will be more tender and better flavored if it 
is placed in the Caloric the day before it is intended to be 
eaten. 

Meats and poultry which are somewhat tough may be 
made tender by leaving them in the Caloric a greater length 
of time than would ordinarily be required. 

The Caloric is an excellent thing for a family whose 
members cannot all have meals at the same time. Part of 
the food may be taken out at the first meal-time and the re- 
mainder left in the cookstoves, where it will keep hot for hours. 



26 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 



The Caloric makes possible great economy in the use of 
seasoning. Half, and indeed, sometimes a third or fourth part 
of what one would ordinarily use will be sufficient. In using 
the Caloric there is practically no evaporation — all the deli- 
cious and delicate flavors remain in the food. Therefore, care 
should be exercised in the use of seasoning. 

There is one Caloric ket- 
tle for each compartment of 
the stove, but it is often con- 
venient to cook more than one 
thing at a time in a compart- 
ment. For this purpose the 
Caloric Company manufactures 
triple-sided nesting utensils of 
Enamelware and Seam less 
Triple Utensils Aluminum, three of which fit 

perfectly, side by side, in an eight or twelve-quart compart- 
ment of any of the Caloric stoves. By the use of these uten- 
sils three varieties of food may be cooked in one compartment 
at the same time. The company also makes double utensils 
of Enamelware only, two of these fitting into one compart- 
ment. These special utensils are not supplied with the regu- 
lar equipment of the stove but cost a slight amount extra.

CALORIC VENTILATING VALVE 



27 



No other fireless cooker has this valve. It is an Exclu- 
sive Caloric Patent. Yet it is the one big factor in securing 
perfect results in baking and roasting. It permits the ex- 
cess of steam to escape while retaining all necessary heat. 
It is directly owing to this steam valve that our marvelous 
results in browning roasts, cakes, biscuits, etc., are obtained. 
In ordinary fireless "Cookers** it is necessary to raise the lid 
in order to allow steam to escape. This cools oflF the oven, 
wastes heat, gets poor results — and keep someone on the spot 
during the whole process of cooking.

SOUPS. 

The foundation of all soups is the juice or extract of meat, 
poultry, game, fish or vegetables. The bones of meat are espe- 
cially rich in nutriment that goes to make up a wholesome and 
palatable soup. The materials for soup cost but little and, 
by using the Caloric, the real expense of the dish — the long 
cooking over the fire — is done away with and it becomes one 
of the most economical as well as one of the most nutritious of 
foods. Meat should not be washed. Wipe it well with a 
piece of cheese-cloth wrung from cold water. Meat for soup 
should always be put on to cook in cold water, heated slowly, 
and not allowed to boil. 

Place soups in the Caloric to keep hot for a second helping 
or for late arrivals.

cheese-cloth. When cold, remove every particle of fat. The 
stock will form a jelly and will keep for days in a cool place. 
By adding strained tomatoes or cooked vegetables, an excel- 
lent soup may be prepared on short notice. For a clear soup 
or bouillon, use equal quantities of stock and water, seasoning 
to taste.

FISH 

Fish is a food that may easily be cooked over a blaze but 
it is most convenient, when one w^ishes to go out and find the 
meal ready on arriving home, to cook it in the Caloric. Fish 
does not become soft, or fall to pieces by standing a consider- 
able length of time in the Caloric. 

Baked Fish — Thoroughly clean the fish and wipe it dry. 
Season with salt and pepper, dip in beaten egg and then in 
cracker crumbs. Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a baking 
pan. Put in the fish with bits of butter on the top. Place in 
the utensil and bake in the Caloric forty-five minutes using 
two radiators. 

Boiled Fish — Roll the fish in cheese-cloth and tie the ends. 
Lower in a Caloric kettle of boiling water, to which has been 
added the juice of half a lemon and a little salt. Cook in the 
Caloric one-half hour, using one radiator. Drain and unroll 
from the cloth onto a platter. Garnish with» parsley and slices 
of lemon, and serve with drawn butter sauce.

ter. Pour over all three cupfuls of hot milk. Bake in the 
Caloric utensil one-half hour, using two radiators. 

Escalloped Oysters and Rice — One cupful of rice and one 
pint of oysters. Use the liquor from the oysters and add 
enough boiling water to make four cupfuls. Add the rice and 
boil one minute, then remove to the Caloric and cook three- 
quarters of an hour, using one radiator. To the cooked rice, 
add two well beaten eggs and a large tablespoonful of butter. 
Into a buttered pan put a layer of rice, a few small pieces of 
butter, a little salt and a dash of pepper. Then add a layer of 
the raw oysters and so on, until the dish is full. Cover with

MEATS 

Meat, although one of the most important foods — and cer- 
tainly the most expensive — is too frequently ruined in the 
cooking. Often all the rich, juicy nutriment is cooked out of 
it leaving the hard, leathery fiber. It should be borne in mind 
that the most expensive meats are not necessarily the most 
nutritious. If the right way of preparing the cheaper kinds is 
thoroughly understood and if the Caloric Cookstove is used, it 
is possible to have a tender and juicy piece of meat at a com- 
paratively small cost. In boiling meat or vegetables for stews, 
etc., it should be remembered that in the Caloric the water 
does not boil away as it does on a range, and if too much water 
is used the dish will not be rich enough. Use little water and 
one or both radiators. The secret of making tough meats ten- 
der is the slow cooking, especially by braising, boiling and 
stewing. The toughest fowl may be reduced to toothsome 
tenderness if steamed in a closed utensil for several hours. 
The Caloric is especially adapted to the cooking of meat in 
these various ways. All meats cooked in the Caloric will be 
found superior in every way to those cooked entirely on a 
flame stove. Meats should not be washed, but wiped with a 
piece of cheese-cloth wrung from cold water. 

In roasting meat do not add water. The steam from the 
cooking meat will be sufficient. When roasting, the cover 
of the utensil is not put on, as the top stone, resting on the 
rack, makes a cover.

pare the following ingredients : Two large, sliced onions ; one 
small, yellow carrot; a piece of lemon peel; one bay leaf; 
twelve to fifteen peppercorns ; a large pinch of sugar and sev- 
eral cloves. Heat a piece of butter in a kettle, put in the meat 
and brown it slightly. Then add a part of the vinegar in which 
the meat was put and the seasoning. Let the whole boil for 
fifteen minutes. Dissolve two or three tablespoonfuls of flour 
in cold water and add this to the meat. Boil again for a 
moment. Place the kettle, tightly covered, in the Caloric and

it into five or six equal parts and spread each part on a slice 
of the meat. Roll up the slices and wind with thread. Turn 
the meat-rolls in flour until they are white all over. Put them' 
into a kettle with hot butter and fry until they are yellow. 
Then add three tablespoonfuls of sour cream, the juice of half 
a lemon, a pinch of sugar and one-half cupful of stock. Let 
them smother in a covered kettle for ten minutes, after which, 
cook in the Caloric one and one-half hours, using one radiator. 

Beef Stew — Cold bits may be used for this or the round or 
any of the cheap cuts of beef. Cut all the fat from the meat 
and cut the lean into small pieces. Fry the fat in a kettle 
gently for ten or fifteen minutes. Then brown the meat, which 
has been seasoned well with salt and pepper. Cut a slice or 
two of onion, turnip or carrot and three or four potatoes into 
small pieces and add to the stew. Cook in the Caloric three 
hours or more, using one radiator. Remove from the Caloric 
to the fire and thicken the stew with one tablespoonful of flour 
rubbed to a paste in a little milk. 

Beef Tea — Remove all the fat from one pound of round 
steak. Cut in one-half inch cubes and put in glass fruit jars.

the water reaches the boiling point remove to the Caloric for 
five hours without using a radiator. Strain, heat over hot 
water and add a little salt. 

Boiled Beef — The brisket or a piece of the round is good- 
for boiling. Put the suet and trimming of the meat in a kettle

radiator. Prepare it before retiring and let it remain in the 
Caloric over night. In the morning, remove from the liquor, 
peel off the skin, press between plates and serve in slices. If 
the tongue is corned, it should be well soaked for several hours 
in cold water before boiling. 

Brown Beef Stew — Cut two pounds of beef into cubes of 
one inch. Roll them in two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of suet into a saucepan and shake it over the

fat. When smooth, add one quart of stock, one teaspoonful of 
salt, one onion, one bay leaf, one small carrot, one saltspoonful 
of pepper and one teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet. Put all 
together into a kettle and cook in the Caloric three hours, 
using two radiators. 

Corned Beef — For cold corned beef the plate piece is the 
best ; while, for a hot dish, the brisket is to be preferred. Al- 
ways have a good layer of fat around it. Place in cold water 
and heat slowly to the boiling point ; then drain the water off. 
Cover with fresh water and heat again to the boiling point. 
Clamp the cover down and cook in the Caloric six or eight

VEGETABLES 

The Caloric is particularly adapted to the cooking of any 
and all kinds of vegetables. Much less water is required than 
when the cooking is done on an ordinary stove or range. Only 
one radiator should be used. A little experience will determine 
the exact time required for each vegetable. In baking vege- 
tables such as potatoes, apples, etc., both radiators are neces- 
sary. Potatoes of ordinary size require from three-fourths of 
an hour to an hour in the Caloric. But, at first, until one has 
become thoroughly familiar with the use of the Caloric it is 
advisable to make the time longer rather than shorter. No 
matter how much longer they are left in the Caloric they 
will not be burned. 

Wilted vegetables should be freshened in cold water be- 
fore cooking. 

Dried vegetables should be soaked in cold water several 
hours or over night, before cooking. 

Starch is the chief component of most vegetables, though 
protein, sugar, fat, mineral matter and water (one or all) are 
combined with the starch. In some vegetables the starch is 
largely in the form of cellulose or woody tissue, but, in what- 
ever form it may be found, the starch must be thoroughly 
cooked in order to be wholesome. 

Vegetables like lettuce, endive, celery (the inner blanched 
stalks) tomatoes, cucumbers and small, quickly grown rad- 
ishes contain but a slight trace of starch. They are composed 
largely of water and mineral salts, both of which will be lost 
during the cooking process unless they are gently simmered. 
When these vegetables are cooked, no more water should be 
added than can be served with them. 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 17 

Green peas and asparagus contain so much starch that 
cooking is a necessity. To retain the sugar and other com- 
pounds, the cooking should be done in the Caloric where 
there is no violent boiling as on a flame stove. 

Parsnips, salsify, carrots and turnips contain but little 
starch other than that found in their cellular structure. This 
fibre, like animal fibre, is hardened by intense heat and should 
not be cooked at a temperature higher than the boiling point 
of water. The cooking should be prolonged until the fibre 
is tender but no longer. 

Potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, samp, macaroni, noodles 
and other pastes used as vegetables are rich in starch. A good 
potato, properly cooked, will be mealy. A potato cooked in 
simmering water, will be water soaked and soggy. If potatoes 
are cooked in furiously boiling water the outside becomes 
softened and washed away while the inside remains hard. 

Hard water has a tendency to harden cellulose or woody 
fibre and thus keeps the juices within the food. Soft water 
acts in the opposite way. Salt added to water makes it hard, 
raises the boiling point a little and intensifies the color of 
green vegetables. Soda softens water and causes green vege- 
tables to assume a faded look. As the appearance of food 
has much to do with our taste for it, the use of salt in the cook- 
ing of green vegetables is advisable. As green vegetables con- 
tain little woody tissue but often sugar, which it is advisable 
to retain in the foods, the cooking of these in salted water 
is to be recommended. In general, salt should be added to the 
water in which all vegetables, except those containing much 
cellulose, are to be cooked. A teaspoonful of salt to each gen- 
erous quart of water should be used. Soft water is preferable 
when the cellulose structure of dried peas, beans and lentils

is to be made tender. If such water is not available, one-half 
teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda to each quart of water will 
accomplish the desired result.

CEREALS 

The value of cereals as food is admitted from the stand- 
point of economy as well as from that of nutrition. Served 
with milk and sugar, they have the same food value as meat. 
Almost without exception, the directions accompanying pack- 
ages of cereals give too short a time for the cooking. It re- 
quires several hours to cook most cereals, if they are to be 
made digestible. In this one particular the Caloric Cookstove 
is worth infinitely more than it costs. It thoroughly cooks 
every kernel, preserving each perfectly whole and rendering 
the cereals soft as jelly. It is preferable to cook cereals in a 
Caloric double boiler, which is an extra equipment at a small 
cost. When, however, a small quantity is desired, it may be 
cooked in a vessel placed in the eight or twelve-quart utensil, 
surrounded by boiling water. 

The water into which cereals is stirred should be boiling. 
Cook in the Caloric, using one radiator. 

Boiled Rice — Put one cupful of washed rice, two cupfuls 
of boiling water and one level teaspoonful of salt into the 
double boiler. Cook one-half hour, using one radiator. A 
handful of raisins is a good addition. The rice may be cooked 
directly over a radiator, without using a double boiler. 

Old Fashioned Oatmeal — One cupful of oatmeal; three 
and one-half cupfuls of water; one and one-half teaspoonfuls 
of salt. Stir the cereal slowly into the water and place in 
the Caloric for four oi five hours, using one radiator. If not 
sufficiently hot at serving time, place the boiler over the fire 
imtil the water boils and the cereal is steaming. Serve with 
cream and sugar. 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 87 

Oatmeal Gruel — Add one-half cupful of coarse oatmeal 
and one-half teaspoonful of salt, to three cupfuls of boiling 
water. Cook in the Caloric six hours. Force through a 
strainer and dilute with milk and cream. Reheat and serve. 

Oatmeal Mush — Into three cupfuls of boiling water, put 
one level teaspoonful of salt and two and one-half cupfuls of 
oatmeal. Cook in the Caloric over night, using one radiator. 

Rice Cooked in Milk — Heat to the boiling point one quart 
of milk. Into this put one cupful of washed rice, a pinch of 
salt, a piece of cinnamon bark, and sugar to taste. Before serv- 
ing, sprinkle sugar and cinnamon or mace over the rice. Cook 
in the double boiler in the Caloric one hour, using one radiator. 

Rice Cooked in Milk with Apples — Cook one cupful of 
rice in one quart of milk, without seasoning, as directed in 
the above recipe. When it is cool, add sugar, lemon peel, a 
pinch of salt and two eggs. Grease a basin with butter and 
put the rice into it. Remove the cores from eight apples. 
Fill the cavities with sugar, add bits of butter and dust with 
cinnamon. Put the rice and apples into the Caloric and cook 
for two hours, using two radiators. 

Rolled Wheat — One cupful of wheat; two and one-half 
cupfuls of water; one teaspoonful of salt. Cook the same as 
Old Fashioned Oatmeal.

BREAD 

Bread is a very important part of the family diet and care 
should be taken in selecting the flour. Do not expect to be 
able to make good bread of inferior flour or of that which is 
suitable only for pastry. Flour made from hard, spring wheat 
is considered the best for bread. 

Baking Powder Biscuits — One quart of flour; one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder ; 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of lard. Wet with milk until it 
becomes a soft dough. Roll out one inch thick, cut into bis- 
cuits and bake in the Caloric rack twenty minutes, using 
two radiators. 

Boston Brown Bread — One cupful of rye meal; one cup- 
ful of corn meal ; one cupful of graham flour ; two teaspoonfuls 
of soda ; one teaspoonful of salt ; two cupfuls of sour milk ; 
three-fourth cupful of molasses. Mix thoroughly and bake 
two and one-half hours in the Caloric, using two radiators. 

Bread No. 1 — Heat to the boiling point, in a Caloric uten- 
sil, one and one-half cupfuls of fresh milk. Add the same 
quantity of cold water. Break into a cup one cake of com- 
pressed yeast and add to it a teaspoonful of sugar and a Ititle 
water. Stir and when the yeast is dissolved, add it to the milk 
and water, which should be lukewarm. Beat in flour enough 
to make a thick batter and set the sponge into a Caloric com- 
partment or on a warm radiator. Care must be taken that the 
sponge does not become hot, for in that case the yeast germs 
would be killed and the bread spoiled. When light and foamy, 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 89 

add one tablespoonful each of sugar and lard and one or two

PUDDINGS 

For steamed puddings, rice and fruit puddings and all 
those that require long and slow cooking, the Caloric is in- 
valuable. In no other way can the old-fashioned, creamy, rice 
pudding of our grandmothers be so delicately cooked. Pud- 
dings to be steamed should be poured into molds and securely 
placed in a Caloric kettle. The water should reach at least 
one-third the way up the mold. Cover the kettle and, when 
the water boils gently over a flame stove, remove the kettle to 
the Caloric and leave it several hours, using one radiator. 
Puddings to be baked should be prepared as for the ordinary 
range oven. The dish may be of earthenware, aluminum or 
enamelware and should be slipped into the wire rack. Pud- 
dings will bake in the same length of time that would be re- 
quired in an ordinary oven. If, however, a pudding is left 
in the Caloric a longer time than is necessary for the baking, 
it will not burn. The Caloric is the nearest approach to the 
old brick oven of our ancestors that the modem world has 
ever seen. It gives just the right finishing touch to the old- 
time dishes, such as New England Indian pudding, Boston 
brown bread, Boston baked beans, etc.

Cake Baked in the Caloric 



CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 105 

CAKE 

The amount of heat required for baking cake varies ac- 
cording to the composition of the cake. Knowledge of the 
exact degree of heat required can be gained only by experi- 
ence. A batter which contains butter needs more heat than 
one in which there is no butter. This fact must be considered 
in the heating of the radiators. A little practice is all that is 
necessary. Only a few recipes for cake are given, as all one's 
own favorite kinds may be baked in the Caloric. Ordinary 
cake pans should be used and slipped into the wire rack 
when the cake is ready for the oven. 



Angel Cake — Whites of eleven eggs; one and three- 
fourths cupful granulated sugar; one cupful of flour; one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar and a pinch of salt. Sift the 
flour four or five times before measuring. Sift the sugar also. 
Beat the whites of the eggs about half, add the cream of tartar 
and the salt and beat until very stiff. Stir in the sugar and 
the flour very lightly and flavor to taste. Bake in a tube pan 
in the Caloric rack forty-five to fifty-five minutes, using two 
moderately hot radiators. 



Brown Sugar Layer Cake — Two cupful s of dark brown 
sugar ; one-half cupful of butter ; one-half cupful of sour milk ; 
two eggs (whites and yolks beaten separately) ; two and one- 
half cupfuls of flour; one-eighth cake of cooking chocolate

SOUFFLES 

Souffles may be made in a shallow basin or dish that will 
fit in the large Caloric vessel. They must be served in the 
dish in which they were baked. The following hint may serve 
as a pleasant variation : 

Put only half of the souffle material into the baking dish. 
Cut a piece of baking wafer the exact size of the dish and place 
it on top of the souffle already in the dish. Place canned fruit 
(without juice), preserves, or freshly stewed fruit (also with- 
out juice) on top of the baking wafer. Put another wafer on 
top of the fruit and then add the other half of the souffle. 
The baking wafer will soften and blend with the souffle and 
the fruit so that it cannot be detected after baking. 

The dish in which a souffle is baked should be well 
greased with butter. 

Almond Soufifle — Chop five and one-half ounces of al- 
monds. Beat together the yolks of six eggs and three-fourths 
cupful of sugar. Add the chopped almonds, two tablespoon- 
fuls of bread crumbs, some grated lemon rind and a pinch of 
cinnamon. Mix well and fold in the beaten whites of the six 
eggs. Bake in the Caloric one and three-fourths hours, using 
two radiators. 

Apple SoufHe — Soak half an hour four or five stale milk 
rolls in milk. Then press out most of the milk. Cream two 
tablespoonfuls of butter with a little sugar and add the yolks 
of four eggs, the soaked milk rolls and five or six finely cut 
cooking apples. A little vanilla or grated lemon rind may also 



112 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

be added. Fold in the beaten whites of the four eggs and 
turn into a baking dish. Bake in the Caloric two hours, 
using two radiators. 

Bread Crumb Souffle — Beat well together four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and four eggs until foamy. Add four table- 
spoonfuls of bread crumbs, a pinch of cinnamon, allspice or 
cloves and one-half teaspoonful of baking powder. Bake in 
the Caloric one and one-half hours, using two radiators. 

Cherry Souffle — This is prepared the same as apple 
souffle using one pound of large cherries instead of apples. 

Lemon Souffle — Beat the yolks of four eggs together with 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar until they are foamy. Add a 
little lemon juice, some grated lemon rind, four tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, a little baking powder and fold in the beaten 
whites of the four eggs. Bake in the Caloric one and one- 
half hours, using two radiators.

STEWED AND BAKED FRUITS 

By means of the Caloric Fireless Cookstove fruit which 
should remain whole may be cooked more satisfactory than 
in any other way. No burning is possible so no stirring is 
necessary and the fruit is thus left whole. If care is exercised 
in removing it from the utensil in whicn it was cooked, it 
should appear on the table in its original shape. 



Baked Apples — Core medium-sized apples but do not 
pare them. Fill the cavities with sugar and bits of butter, or 
with raisins and English walnuts. Cover well with sugar and 
pour a cupful of water around them. Sprinkle with nutmeg 
before serving. Bake in the Caloric, using two radiators. 



Stewed Apples — Pare apples and remove the cores. Boil 
some water in a Caloric utensil. There should not be more 
than an inch of water in the vessel. Place the apples in the 
water and sprinkle sugar over them. Cover the kettle and 
cook in the Caloric one hour, using one radiator. 



This recipe may be varied by filling the apples with 
chopped nuts and raisins. 



Stewed Apricots — Apricots should not be too ripe. Pare 
them and remove the stones. Heat to the boiling point a few 
tablespoonfuls of water. Put the apricots into this and 
sprinkle them with sugar. Cook in a covered kettle in the 
Caloric one-half hour, using two radiators. 



114 CALORIC BOOK OF RECIPES 

Stewed Pears — Pare the pears without removing the 
stems. Put them into cold water immediately so that they

Stewed Peaches or Plums — Put the fruit into a kettle. 
Sprinkle sugar over it and add a little water. Follow the 
recipe for stewed apples.

slices and put them into cold water. Heat a little water to 
the boiling point and add the quinces with sugar and a little 
lemon juice, white wine or vinegar. Cook in a covered kettle

Soak for several hours in two cupfuls of cold water. Heat 
to the boiling point on a flame stove and place the kettle in 
the Caloric for three hours, using one radiator. When done, 
stone and quarter the prunes. Soak one-half box of gelatine 
in one-half cupful of cold water and add it to the prune juice. 
Add one cupful of sugar and one-fourth cupful of lemon juice. 
Strain, add the prunes and pour into molds. When cold, serve 
with whipped cream and sugar.

CANNING AND PRESERVING 

Before starting to can fruits or vegetables see that the 
jars are perfectly clean, that the rubbers are new and that 
the jar tops are in good condition. Always select the best 
fruit for canning. 

I 

In canning berries, fill the jars as full as possible. Make 
a heavy syrup and pour it over the berries in the jar until 
the jar is full. Seal immediately and place in a kettle half 
filled with boiling water. Remove to the Caloric for six hours 
or longer, using one radiator. Berries will retain their shape 
and the juice will be clear. 

In preserving peaches or pears, pare and core the fruit, 
pack it in jars and proceed as for berries. 

Canned Green Corn — Cut the corn from the cob and pack 
it tightly in glass jars. Put the rubbers on the jars and seal 
them. Set the jars into a kettle with enough boiling water 
to reach the top. Place in the Caloric, using one radiator and 
leave until the water is cool. 

String Beans — Cut up fresh string beans into one-inch 
lengths and pack them tightly in glass jars. Pour over them 
salted, boiling water and proceed as in the recipe for corn. 

To Render Lard — Wash and cut up leaf lard in small 
pieces, place in a large kettle and set the kettle on a radiator 
while it is heating. When both are hot, remove to the Caloric 
and leave over night. Next morning, strain, and the lard will 
be fine and white.

The Caloric Co. 



Note This : Professor Charles Barnard, the highest authority in 
America, for many years in charge of the Housekeeping 
Experiment Station at Darien, Conn., has used a Caloric 
three years and he recommends the Caloric Cookstove — 
see Bulletin No. 14, issued February, 1912, entitled 
"Housekeeping Efficiency." 

Note This: An authority in a recent issue of Century Maga- 
zine says: "The three great scientific inventions of this 
century are Wireless Telegraphy, Aviation and the Fire- 
less Cookstove (not cooker). 

The Caloric is the only Fireless Cookstove in the world.
