This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

2 heaping tablespoonsful of lard (or 
half butter and half lard)

Mix flour, lard and salt well together, 
and then add enough cold water to make 
the dough soft enough to roll out. If 
it sticks to the rolling pin, use a little 
flour. Then grease the pie plate, and 
take half of the dough, rolled out flat, 
and cover the pie plate. Cut off the edge 
with a knife. Then put in your fruit. 
Take the other half of your dough, rolled 
out for a top, and cut around the edge 
with a knife, and then press all around 
the edge with a fork, to make the edges 
stick together. Then you will have one 
grand pie. 

This pie crust recipe will do for any 
kind of pie. Evaporated apples should 
be cooked the same as peaches. 

All dry fruit should be soaked over 
night.
