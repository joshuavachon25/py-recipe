importance; the health and uclfare of the family dependini;- 
so largely upon it. 

Chetnical Changefi. 

Certain chemical changes must take place in some of the 
components of the mixture, and as it is vei-y impoilant that 
all the necessary conditions for aiding these changes should 
be perfect, it is of course plain to every housekeeper that 
both Icnowledge and skill are required to become successful 
m the art of bread-niukinii-.

YEAST, MTXINO, KXEADIXO. 



Ved.st. 

After tlic (|ii;ility of the tloiir, the fii-st thing- to be con- 
sidered in l)re;id-niaking' is the yeast. Without g'ood yeast 
it is impossible to make <4'ood bi-ead, anti it should he the 
ambition of every housekeeper to acquire? the art of making- 
a g-ood article of home-made yeast. 

The first step in bi'cad-making- is mixing- the ingredients. 
Atmospheric chang-es alTect the sponge, and it is therefore 
necessary to mix it in a stone vessel and keep it excluded 
from the aii*. In summer no artificial heat is needed, hut in 
winter it should be kept warm. 



Kneadim/. 

The length of time required for kneading is materially 
afl'ected by the (|uality of tli(> tloui- and kind of yeast used, 
the better the quality of botli the less time for kneading" Avill 
be needed. 

Ready to Bake. 

The most important point in bread-making- is reached 
when the loaves ai-e put in t,he pans for the last time. To 
decide when dough is sulTicimtly light to bake is a mattei* 
of great consideration to the cook, as it varies in ditl'erent 
tempei\atui-es and at dilferent seasons of the year, but prac- 
tice will soon teach the leng-th of time reciuired. It is, 
however, seldom less than half an hour or more tlian two 
hours. 

Condition of the Oven. 

A loaf of bi-ead should nearly double in size after it is put 
in the pan. The heat of the oven should bo moderate when 



i 



\ 



I 



BAKING. 



I 



ihe bread is put to bake, and slmuid he ^Ta.lnally increased 
111 intensily. 

An ordinary sized loaf of bread witli the oven at proper 
temperature will bake in an hour. 

To Ascertain when Done. 

Tliere are vai-ious methods of testing- bread, to ascertain 
when It IS done A loaf of bread, when done, will not burn 
tlici ha^nd. It It does tliere is mo,-e heat-steam within tlian is 
consistent with perfect baking-, and the bread should l,e 
replaced in the oven. The crust of a well-baked loaf of 
bread is a rich brown. If any doubt is entertained of the 
bread bein^-- well (hme, it is better to err by leaving- it in the 
oven a little too Ion- than not long- enoug-li. 



After Baking. 
Bread as soon as baked should be taken from the pans 
and placed uncovered in such a position as will expose the 
g-reatest possible amount of surface to the air This will 
prevent the crust from being hard, as well as' permit the 
rapid escape of gas involved in the process of fermentation. 

Yeast. 
Housekeepers differ as to the best kind of yeast. Some 
piefe. that made f,-om potatoes, because bread made from it 
IS moist and an excessive quantity will not injure the bread. 

^C^. ''-' '^^ ^^^^^^' ^^ ^^^"^ ----- -^^^ i- 

Dry yeast finds favor with many on account of the con- 
venience of always being- ready, in hot or damp weather it 
sometimes loses its vitality, and in purchasing it from 
dealers it is well to be careful to have it fresh. We have 
found the ordinary Dry Hop yeast cakes superior to anv 
commercial yeast we have ever tried. They are strung- and 



•-^T'^l 



4 YEAflT. 

retain their vitality for a .s^roat loiif^-tii of time. Other yeast 
cakes may, however, be used when these are not easily 
obtainable. 

Do not add soda or sugar to sour yeast, for it will never 
make ^'•ood bread. Always Iceep yeast in a stone jug tig-htly 
stopped and set in a cool place where it will not sour, and in 
a warm place where it will not fi-eeze in wintei;. The Jug- 
should be waslied and dried wlien empty. 

Two cups of potato yeast, one of hops and one yeast cake 
are equal in sti'ength. 

Too nuich 3X'ast injures the flavor of bread and should be 
avoided. 

We give a variety of excellent receipts for making ditfei'- 
ent kinds of yeast, from which a selection can be made. 

Farmer^ s Yeast. 

Take a handful of hops, put them in one quart of water 
with four potatoes, boil until the potatoes are done, mash 
all together and steam ; add flour enough to make a thick 
batter, a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of ginger and half 
a cup of sugar, let come to a boil, stir and set otf to cool ; 
when the milk is warm add a cup of yeast or one yeast gem. 
Keep warm and it Avill be light in two or three hours. Put 
in a jug and stop tight, set in a cool cellar. 

Sweet Yeast. 

Monday morning boil one pint of hops in two gallons of 
water for half an hour. Sti-ain into a crock and let the 
liquid cool, add two teaspoons of salt and a pint of brown 
sugar. Mix half a i^int of floui" smooth with some of the 
liquid and stir all together. In three days add three pounds 
of mashed potatoes, stir in and let stand twenty-four hours, 
then strain and keep warm until it rises. 

Put in stone jugs and leave uncoi'ked a day or two. It

place four days ; stir frequently. On the fourth day boil and 
mash three pounds of potatoes and mix in the yeast. Let 
stand one more day, strain and bottle. It will keep in a 
cool place for months.

BISCUIT. 



Biscuits sliould he uiado and halved (iuicl<I.v in order to 
have tlieiii lig-lit. 

In a ^veli-lloated oven ei;L;-h1; minutes is sullleieiit time to 
bal<o biscuit brown. 

Lard and buttei' mixed is tlie l)est siiorteniii^'. 

Wiien water is used iov moisteniny- llie douyh, a \er.v bot 
lire will he required for balvin/:,'-. 

The success of tiie recipes ^;iven for biscuit depends 
f^-reatiy on the purity of the baldn^- powder aiui soda used, 
as it is impossible to have ft'ood bread if these vcvy necessary 
in^nvdieMls are of an inferior quality. 

Baking- powder can be made at home, but it is cheaper to 
buy a superior make of it, and mucli more satisfactory. 
Horsford's Baking- Powder, prepared by the Rumford 
Ciiemical Works, Pi'ovidence, R. T.. we can recommend. 
There may be other makes as ^-ood, l)ut we have tested 
this thoroug■hl3^ 

Soda biscuit should be handled as little as possible. 

Always mix baking- powder in the Hour before sifting-. 

Biscuit should be pricked with a fork before putting them 
in the oven.

CHAPTER VII. 



COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 



id 



With regard to the quality of coffee the best is the cheap- 
est. A mixture of one-third Moclia and two-thirds Java will 
be found the best. 

They should be roasted separately and kept in separate 
canisters. 

Java requires a longer time in browning than Mocha. 

Coffee is much better when roasted, ground, and made at 
once. It should be ground line, but not to a powder. 

Too much boiling destroys the delicate llavoi" of coffee, 
and it should never be made until the meal is ready to serve. 
Great care should be given the coffee-pot, for unless it is 
kept thoroughly clean it is impossibe to have good collee. 

Various are the methods of preparing thi . ''Beverage of 
Arabia." Some housekeepers preferring boiled, while 
others use ffltered colfee, but to have either in perfection it 
is necessary to select good coffee, roast it with care, grind 
properly, and have the coifee-pot thoroughly clejin. 

The accompanying illustrations show a form of coffee- 
pot which has lately grown into gi-eat favor with those who 
are fond of pure coff'ee. The colfee nuist be ground very fine, 
to a powder if possible. It is then placed in a strainer, 
shown in the illustration, which is secured in the interior of 
the coffee-pot and the boiling water poured over it. The 
water must absolutely be at the boiling point when poured 
over the coffee, and it is better to heat the coffee-pot before

Frtjfm/ Fish. 

The proper method of frying- llsh is simply' boiling in lard. 
French cooks n(!ver use butter, as tlu' color is not ^'ood, but 
give the j)i'eferenci' to beef fat . The ^i-eat secret of success 
is to liuvc the fat at the proper temperature before putting 




WHITE-FISH. 

in the fish. Experienced cooks know just when the boiling 
point is reached, but for the beginnei- this is difiicult to 
decide : a good test is to di'op in a piece of dough or a bit 
of bread, if it browns in a minute, the fat is at the proper 
heat.

It is roally as necossai-y. in ordvv 1o mako ij'ood cake, to 
follow the clircrlioiis ^^ixi'ii I'oi' pi'opcr mixing' as it is to be 
exact as to the liuaiility of iiii^i'edieiits iisi-d. Fi'equently

separat^'ly. 

It may take live minutes loui;vi' ; bii1 i1 is very litlle 
more trouble and makes sntlicient dill'ei'enci' in llie cake to 
more than repay one foi' the extra work. 

Cake to be y'ood nmst be made with tlu' i:ieat(\st care. If 
tlie weather is wai'm, place tli(> euiis in cold water, and let 
stand a few moments, as they will readily beat to a froth. 
Sift Hour and sui^'ar befoi'e usinu': l>utter should be cut in 
bits and crushed : if too hai'd place it in a waini I'ooni, but 
in no case melt it . 

Only tlie best butter should be used as tlie lieat develops 
any latent bad (lualities. Use the best pulverized su^ar. 

Bakin,!?' powder will be found excellent for all cakes. In- 
ferior thivoi-in.^" ft'ivcs a l)ad taste to cake and sometimes 
retards tlu^ rising-. It will therefore he found the best 
economy to use a ^'ood article. 

Beat tlie yolks of eg-g"s for cake and then strain. Sift the 
flour to be used. Sweet mUk Avhicli must always be used 
with baking powder, makes fii-m, solid cake; sour milk,

A wooden spoon should be used ; nescr mix in tin, hut

sliould he rounded up I'ldl. 

Never use the while portion of oran.ii'e or lemon peel,

lined with thin l)i'own pa|)er. 

When plaeeil in the stox'c the cake slionUl l)e covered

Too much car(> cannot be i;iven to the pi-eparation of the

on proper bakini;'. 

The oven may be tested by holdini^' llie liand insid(» foi- 
twenty or twenty-live seconds, if the heat can be borne tliat 
length of time the oven is in i^'ood order. 

Care should be taken not to remove the c;ike from the 
oven until done; tost witli a clt>an bi'oom straw or a 
knitling'-needle, if the dou,i;h does not adhere, it is done. 
When removed set the cake while in the pan on an inverted 
sifter to cool. It should remain in the pan at least lifteen 
minutes after taking* from the oven, when it can be care- 
fully removed and set away right side up. A tin cake-box 
or large stone jar is best to keep cake in.

DIRECTIONS FOR ICING. 

There arc various opinions as to the length of lime frost- 
ing- shoukl be beaten, but that it should be thoi'on.iihly 
beaten is vei'\' imjiortant, also that the eg'gs be fresh and 
the sug'ar of the l)(>st (jualily. IJoiled icin.i;' is more 
economical tlum the cold icin.t;', antl when properl\' made 
is equal I \' as ^'ood. 

As e.^\i;-s vary in size it is didicult to always decide the 
quantity of su,i^ar reiiuired, and practice alone will teach 
how stilf icing- should be made.

the freezer scrape down and beat with a lar<4V iron s|)oon. 

It- is best to freeze ice cream in a wai-m place (the Juore 
I'apid the meltin<>- of the ice the t|uickei' the cream freezes), 
he watchful that no water or salt .i^'ets inside the freezer. 

Ice cream may l)e formed into fanciful and ornamental 
shapes l)y usin.i^- moulds made expressly for the purpose. 
After the cream is fi-o/en put it in the moulds. Set in 
pounded ice and salt, covej- close with a l)lanket until ready 
to serve.

The liusband whose liome is always neat and comfortable 
and who can invite his friends to partake of a meal in his 
house, in full conlidence of lindini;- eveiytliin,<4' in a presenta- 
Itlc coiulit ion, will feel pri(le and exnitalion in the possession

and economy. These rules, if siriclly adhered to, aiul 
^•uided by love, cannot fail to make of every woman, a 
thou«^'litful and enei';L;'etic houseUee[)ei'. 

House Cleaning. 

Tnis necessary woi'k of the liousekeepei-, by proper mau- 
ag-ement, can be done so as to cause very little iucoiix cii- 
ience to either the mistress or the family ; but hei-e, as in nil 
else, perfect system should prevail. 

Do not I)ei4in sprin.i;- cleaning- too soon, as i1 is neither 
pleasant nor safe to throw open the house for scrtil)l»iii.i;' 
and aii'ing- in cool changeable weathci'. He sure the weath- 
er is settled, and have evei-ythin^' in readitu-ss before 
beijrinning-. Provide lime, sti'ong' soap, ammonia, carbolic 
acid, Sapolio and copperas. Do not upset the whole house at 
once, it is not necessary. By taking' one or two I'ooms at a 
time the cleaning- can be just as satisfactorily accomplisiied 
and no one inconvenienced. E\'ery liousekeepei- can use 
hei' own discretion as to where to be<4-in. Some select the 
attic while others conmience with the cellar, which is iniim- 
portant, the g'reat item bein^ thorough lu'ss in e\er\ de- 
partment from be^-innin<;' to end. All furniture should l)e 
moved, pictures and ornaments taken from the walls, and 
carpets taken up. Bare walls should be whitev ashed, anil 
papered o\ws wiped olf witli a flannel cloth; paints should 
be washed with anunoiiia and warm water; windows wash- 
ed and polis'icd : floors wiped olV with hot suds and rinsed 
with strong- hot brine. In washing- out presses and closets 
use very hot water in which put cayenne pepper, then 
spriidde with benzine to keep away vei-min and motlis. 
Having- the room clean, go over all the furniture with pol- 
ish : if t roubled with bed-bugs, wash the beds with hot alum

sauce-pans, tin kettles and cooking- utensils should be put

Sapolio. Walls should be whitewashed and tiooi" scoured, 
sinks and drains should be cleansed with carl)olic acid and 
hot water. After house cleaning- has b»'en completed, the 
yard, cellar, ice-lu)use and entire surroundings should un- 
dergo tlu^ same process : lime and carbolic acid should be 
freely used to cleanse aiul purify.

yVie Kitchen. 

A neat well-ordered kitchen will ensure not only the 
comfort but. in a g-i-eat deg->'ee the liealth of the family, and 
should be the first thing looked to in the household even if 
to do so, denuinds a sacrifice of luxury in the pai'lor and 
dining--room. Every house should have a large airy 
kitchen, with plenty of light and thorough ventilation, 
and it should be provided with a liberal supply of utensils 
to simplify and expedite labor. Then perfect system 
should be established, for in no department is the old adage 
more useful — "A place for everything", and everything- in its 
place" — than in the kitchen. When it is practicable, it is 
best to have the floor made of hard wood, and oiled every 
two or three months, as g-rease will not show and can be 
easily wiped up. The walls should be kept pure and 
clean by an occasional coat of whitewash. Two oi' three 
hirge roomy presses with shelves will be found a great con- 
venience, while a safe with di'awers in which to keep the 
small utensils of kitclien use is very necessary. A larg-e 
lamp should be hung- in kitchens not lig-hted by g-as. 
Plenty of coarse linen towels and dish-i-ags should be fur- 
nished the cook, and every mistress of a household should

ai)artnientssli()uld l)escru[)uiousiv neat and ordcily, while it 
should be the aim of every mothei' to study the cond'oi't and 
taste of her family in the arran^^cmcnt and preparation of 
every meal. Tlu; table-eloth should always be spotless and 
fine, and an unilei'-eover of white eloth spread ^^'ives the 
linen a heavier, smoother a|)|)eai'anee. Naj)kins should be 
line and thick, and shoidd ne\er l)e starched. The dishes 
should he well kept anil fi'ee from crack's: the silvei" always 
bri.niitly polished. At dinin,i;s or eiiterlaiimients no orna- 
ment is so i)i'etty on thetable as Mowers, I'eside each plate 
shouUl be placed as many knives, forks and s[)oons as will 
be needed, a ^"lass I'oi' water, and where wine is used, g'lasses 
foi' wine are set near each plate. The nai)kin neatly folded 
is placed on each plate, and between it a small slice of bread. 
All {)lates nt'eded aie set out ready. The dessert plates 
should be set convenieid. 

At breakfast the collee and tea is set before the mistress, 
wit h cream, sui^-ar, cu|)s and saucers. The meat with plates 
is set befoi-e the master. Foi- family use, or a small social 
dinner, one castor is sutlicient. Butter is jiut in two small 
butter dishes with lumps of ice. Honey oi- syrup is served 
in saucers. 

To clear the table after meals and properly wash the 
dishes is a very important branch of housekeeping', and if 
carelessly done causes great annoyance and discomfort to 
the family. 

As soon as a meal is ovei* the frag'ments should all be 
g-athered up, and the plates scraped ; the crumbs should be 
lightly swept until the dishes are I'emoved, then they can be 
taken np on the dnst-pan. To wash the dishes have clear

hand will hear, Init- not too hot. Wash lirst one l)oilerful, 
takin.i;' the linest, and cleanse throu>ih two suds, then ))lace 
in a l)oiier of cold watei', with sullicient soa|) to make ^ood 
suds. A handful of boi-ax to e\-ery ten ij;allons of water 
whitens the clothes, and is used by many. Fov laces, cam- 
brics, etc., an exti'a (juantitN' of [lowder is used, l^oi-ax 
bein;^' a metal salt, doe*; not in the si i.i;-ht est de^-ree injure 
the texture of linen. Clothes should not boil over live or 
teji minutes, after which they should be rcjuoved to a tub 
and cold water poured over them ; turn all of the .yarmejits 
wrojiti' side out. Repeat until all are boiled, then wash 
thoron^'hly. Rinse in a tub of soft water, washing' with 
the hands, not simply liftiiii;- them out of the water and 
then wrin^'injU, as is practiced by some, because all of the 
suds must be washed out to make them clear and white ;

put into a tub of blue water. Stir up occasionallx , as the 
blue water sometimes settles to the bottom, and then spots 
the clothes. Wrin.i;' out for the last time and plac" the 
clothes wiiicli are to be starched in oiie basket and the rest 
in aiu)ther, to l)e hwuix out immediately. Have the starch 
as hot as the hand can bear, dip the ai'ticles which Jieed to

If a machine is used in washin;u', it is better to soak the 
clothes overnight in warm soft watei", soaping coUai's, 
wristbands and all soiled pieces. 

Befoi'e washing' tiannels shake out the dirt and lint: use 
only soft clean water, make suds, but do not apply soap to 
the flannel. 

In washing' mei'ino, lambs' wool or any woolen fifoods, do 
not rub them, butcleanse them by drawin^'them throu^^ii the 
hands up and down — in tlie suds. llid)l)in^' shrinks woolen 
and silk^'oods. When clean wi'in^' as diw as possii)le, then 
rinse in a tub of hot water* in which a little soap has ix^en 
dissolved. Shake each piece, wrin^' out, stretch in propei* 
shape and hang* smoothly on the line. 

Never wash woolen ^oods on a cloudy day. 

In washing*" colored cotton ^oods, care is necessary to 
prevent fading', and ^'ivin^' them a fresh look. ('alico«'s, 
and muslins washed in warm suds, made with soft water 
and white soap will retain their freshness a long- time. 
They should not be allowed to soak, and should be washed, 
turned and dried as speedily as possible. 

For goods that fade use ammonia instead of soap. Ox- 
gall is also excellent, used with powdered borax. Black 
pepper put in the watei" in which buff, gray or black dresses 
are washed will preserve the color,

imperfectly ironed, may be wet wit h a sponge and ironed

DYEING. 



CHAPTER XXXV. 

DYEING. 

'* Dyeing' is iho i^'rcal irsourcM' of a sli'iulci" wardi'obe, " says 
a ii()1(hI ]atl\' cconouiisl, and wo have louiul it so. It is an 
art woi'tli loariiin^- and learning- well ; by its use ]oiif;'-\vorn 
g-ui'inents I'usty from woai' can be restored, or new ones of 
delicate colors, injured by acids, wine or fi-iiit stains, can 
be readilj^ renewed. White stockin^»s no lon^ei' fasbionable 
can be j^-iven lovely delicate lines, or deep I'icli ones ; silk 
laces too yellow foi* wear; I'eatliers injui-etl seeniin^'ly be- 
yond reclaiming-; i-ibboiis, that are soiled and faded, and 
g'loves in the same condition ; can all be made to look new. 

All woolen ^'oods ilyo well. Silk never look's <iuite as 
well as wben ncAv, but can bemadeto answei'inany jiurposes. 
Irish poplins coloi' well, but shrink considerably. Velvets 
can be dyed, but lose much in ai)|)earance. Half-worn 
fabi'ics of dai'k coloi* may be bleached by di|)pini;' a moment 
only in chloride of lime, then well rinsed, and they will talae 
any color desired. In coloi'in<;' use plenty of soft water, 
and use a vessel of sutricient size to spread out the ^oods. 
All f^-rease and dirt}' spots should be removed from clothes 
before d^yeini;- ; scour well with soap ;nid watei', rinse and dip 
in warm water before puttini;' in the dye, after which 
wash through soap suds, and hang out to dry. Many per- 
sons use dyes prepared at home from various recipes, but 
this is mistaken economy. " The Family Dyes," now kept 
by all druggists, aside from their convenience, do their work 
much more perfectly and are far cheaper.

llie. inotliec of 1 he I'aniil.N" should he ac(iiiaiiiled with 1 he art 
of di.'essiii,n' wounds, cuts and sjn-iins. 'Plie color o]' the 
bh)ocl indicates the depth of the wound and the amount of 
tlan^Ljor. 11" the color is crimson and Jets out, an arter\- has 
been cut, anil should i)e stop|)ed at once. If the hlood lh)w- 
ini;' from the wound he dark and comes in a steady sti'cam, 
a vein has been cut ; while not so serious, it is best to stop 
it at once. Wounds sliould be promptly dressed. Wash 
clean, hrin.i;' tbe e{l<;'es toi^'ether and cover with adiiesive 
piastei', or stitclies taken with linen thread. The inthiniuKi- 
tioii of wounds is usually iiiiki l)ut sometimes it may becouio 
severe and should be ti-eated kg as to allay it, ; the applica- 
tion of warm Avater is i^ood, but a pli,>'sician should l)e con- 
sulted. If an artery is cut a sli.i^ht pi'essure may prexent 
the llowin.i4' of ai'terial blood, if ri,i;litly applied, until a sur- 
jj;'eon comes. As tlie blood Hows in tlu; arteries fi'om tlie 
heart to e\ery part of the limbs and tlie body, the pr-essuj-e 
should be made at some point above tlie wound or between 
the heart anil wounil ; it is best to compress the artery 
ai4'ainst a bone. 

A punctui'e by a rusty nail, bit of ^'lass or any shai'p

SANITARY TREATMENT 

Of Diphtlioriji, Scarlet Fcvit, Measles, Cholera, Siiiaii-

Depai'tnient. of Health of Bi'ooklyn, N. V., iiiul will he found 
of vory ,i;-i'(';it valuo in all cast's o\' conla^^'ious and infeclious 
diseases : 

Diphtliei'ia, Scai'lel Fevei', Mt'as](>s and Sniall-Pox are 
hiii'ldy eontaiiions diseases, a1 t;iekin,ii' pei'sons of all ag"es, 
:ind may be contracled fi'om those who are ahvady affected, 
from tlie clothes that tht.'y have wtjni, and from e\-eiyt hin;;' 
which lias been in the room willi them. Tlif iid'crtion 
cling's to tlie body even after death, and these diseases ma\' 
tlierefore be conlracteil fi'om the bodies of those who have 
died with them. Even the walls of the I'oom may be a 
source of infection to ])ei'sons comin.i;' intit it after the 
patient has left it, unless the infectious matei'ial is destroN'- 
ed. In order to prevent tlie spicad of these diseases in a

An upi)er, sunny room, pi'ovidt.'d if possible with an open 
lire-place, and with no children on the same tlooi', should be

room of all ai'ticles except, those al)soluteiy necessarN, the 
siil)se(itieiit disinrection is much more easilv pei'l'onned. If 
it is (h-emed necessary, a few small ru.ns will take ihe place 
of the cai'pet. The iii'e-place serves a double purpose: 
(irst., as a means of ventilation ; and second, by keeping' a 
smal! lire burning- thei-ein, when the weathei' will permit, 
the i)iec(^s of soft muslin or othei' material, whici) should

ini4' the secr«'tions fi'om the mouth or nose, esjx-cially in 
diphtheria, can readily l)e destroyed by fire, and thus con- 
ta.^ion by their means prevented. 

One or two adults should take the entire charge of the 
patient, undei- no circumstances coming- in contact with 
other persons, especially childi-en. Kissing" and "taking- 
the breatli " of persons having- contagious diseases are 
esix'cially dangerous, and should always be avoid(>d. Opcm 
windows and o])en lire-places, with lire in IIkmu da.N' and 
night, avoiding- dranghts and chilly air, protect the sick 
and thos(! who nurse them. 

Nothing- should be removed fi'oni the room when the 
pati(!nt has once entered it, until it has been thoroughly 
disinfected. 

Books, scrap-books, to^'s and other playthings should 
always be desti'oyed at the tei'mination of the sickness, as 
being- undoubted cari'iei-s of contagion. Locks of haii- and 
other keepsakes have also been known to spread contagion. 

Nurses should keep themselves and their patients as clean 
as j)ossible, remembering that the more the infection accu- 
mulates, the more dangerous does it become. Special care 
should be taken in changing- sheets and clothing-, not to 
shake them or distuib them more tha»' ^s absolutely neces-

DISINFECTION. 

It is a popular idea that anytiiiuij;- which destroys an 
olfensive odor is a disinfectant. This is not oidy lirroneous, 
l)ul hiirmful, as r(!liance is thus placed on substances t lial 
in iu) wise act as destroyers of infectious materials, which 
l:)1tei- substances ai'c the only ti'ue disinfectants. The 
me'hods recommended in this cii'cular are, to a considera- 
l^h' extent, l)ased upor) t he I'esults of the work of tlie('om-

As already direct od, the materials used in wipiii';- away 
the diseliar.^cs of tlie siek may l)e Ixiriied in tiieopeii lire- 
|)laee, if such tliere be. In ^('iieral, tliis metliod oT dis[)osal

exposed to infection, whicii cannot l)e treated wit h l)oiIin^' 
\\at(M', and, c(tul(l it be cai'i'icd out in all cases, woulil make 
disinfection a \t'i'.\ sinipU' matter. If it is desired to burn 
substances suspected (»f bein,^' infected, and there is no lire 
in the room, such substances maybe wrapped in a sheet 
soaked \\\\\\ Stamlard Solution No. :>, liereaflci- refei'red to, 
and in this coiidiiion conveyed to the lire in the furnace or 
elsewhere. 

BoiJintf Wafer. 

Ex|)eriment has diMuonst rated that boiling' in watin* for 
half an hour will dest ro\' t he \itality of all known disease 
ii'crms. 'J'his is therefore recommended as t he best means 
to be employed in the disinfection of all articles which can 
be thus treatinl, such as the l)ody-clothini;' of the patient, 
the bed clothes, towels. (Mc. All utensils which are used 
in the room in the IviMlin.ii- of tlu' pati(Mit. such as plates, 
tumblers, spoons, knives, forks, etc., should likewise b(> treat- 
ed with t)oilin^' water befori> beiu.ii' removed from the room. 
Food itself, not consumed by the patient . should not be used 
by others, as it is liable to become infected in the sick 
room. 

If, as will often be the case, there are no facilities for 
treatiui;' articles with boil in.y water in the sick room, they 
may with safety be removed to another part of the house 
for this treatment if they are carefully enveloped in a towel 
or sheet, as the case may require, which has been thoroughly

POULTRY RAISING. 

Pei'haps no branch of industry wonicn may cn.u'ap' in is 
moro ^encM'ally pr()li1al>i(' than poulli'.x' i-iisini:-, ami il is I'asl 
attaining- an iniporlanl i-ank amon;;' llic lal)t)i' piirsiiils of 
our country. Ever^N' rural ncii^iiboi'liood and small town 
have their poult!'y yards, and there are several excellent, 
periodicals devoted to yivini^' information upon the subject, 
while every agricultural pai)er has its poultry department, 
thus instructing everyone in this axocation, which oilers 
rare advantages. It gives fresh all', exercise and health 
especially to those of sedentai'y habits, besides furnishing 
a regular income, for poult ly pi'optMly managed pays a 
larger profit in return for th(; outlay made in conducting it 
than any othei- business of a similai' nature. 

A very limited cai)ital is i-eipiired to establish poultry 
raising in a small way, l)ut to be; successful everyone under- 
taking the business should be pre|)ared to take care of and 
provide for the fowls, or failui'e will be the result of their 
etforts. The lirst thing to be considercHi is a sui1al)le 
shelter for them. In selecting a location foi- a poultry 
house dampness should always be avoided, as it is the main 
cause of many of the diseases to which chick<Mis are subject. 
A southern exposm-e is best, and the house shoidd he so 
situated that it will be sheltered fi-om chilling winds. In 
constructing the hen-house plenty of room should be pro- 
A'ided, and due consideration should b(> given to warmth, 
light and ventilation without exposure to currents of air;

Chicken cholt'i-i is the most fatal tliscast' to wliicli fowls 
arc subject. Fowls that arc well W(\ and kept in clean 
conifortal»]e houses are not lial)le to ilisease. WluMi at- 
lacketl lliey lia\e a sleepy tiejecled look, the comb and 
wattles lose llieir coloi', the dischai^e is i-'i'eeiiish and tjiev 
sta^'.ii'ec as 1 hey walk. 

It is very dillicult to save chickens if cholera comes amoii^' 
them. The best plan is to kill and icmove fi-om tJie poultry 
yard all the sick ones, and i:ive the entire j)remises a tho- 
rough cleaning, making' fi-ee use of ilisinfectants, A solu- 
tion of carbolic acid may i)e v:'\\v\\ the fowls, also willow 
chairoal. The following' icmedies may be given by those 
wishing to tr,\ them : 

1, Two drachms of calomel in one (piart of corn-nu-al, 
FeG{.\ twice a day, 

'.?. Powdei-ed chalk, powdered charcoal, gum camphoi", 
asafu'tida and cari)olit- acid ('(pial parts. Mix in food. 

'.\. Fowlei- s(,)lidioii and a(|ua ammonia e(|ual parts in one 
gallon of water, 

4, Tincture of iodine mopped in the lhi-oat and nH)utli. 

Rou|) is a \'ery troublesome and fatal disease, and isal- 
v.ays tlie I'csult of neglect on the part of the poult ly raiser. 
It is very contagious and tow Is iulVited should immediately 
l»e removed from the others, ('harcoal slioidd be freelv 
gi\en. and Douglas' mixture is (wcellent. 

(rapes. This gi-eal enemy of the |)oullry raiser is caused 
by the preseiuc of minute worms in the wind-pipe. Well- 
kept chickens ne\er lia\t> it. '^I'o ciu-e gapes funngate with 
cai'l)olic acid, feed i"reel.\ with gailic, and put asafo'tida in 
the food. 

Numerous other diseases will attack fowls that are(>x- 
posed to dampness, exf renu' cold, (ill hy coo|is and inferior 
and scant food; but they may all be avoided by due atton-

our object in writing;' this article. 

The si/,e of a tlowei' ^-arden must of course vary with 
circumstances, but i^vnerally siieakin.u' it should not be on a 
larft-e scale, and when thus limited Ihe form should be some- 
what re.iiularand have as few lines of circinuference as may 
be. Tf the eye tak(»s in the whole outline at one view, the 
boundary should be such as to satisfy. A la r.tic enclosure, 
where the eye I'an.n'os indelinitely. will admit of nioi'e irre.i^u- 
lar shape. The subject of (ififure and boundary merits espe- 
cial study in laying- out a 11ow(M' .i^-arden, as much of the 
beauty depeiuls on this matter. A .y-reat variety of fi^'ures 
may be indul^-ed in for tlower l)cds. Ciicular or oval forms,

niali' l)ee hi the air. 

The hfe of the (lueen averag-es Ironi foiir to six' years. 
Tlie (lueen has a stin^\ yet may be 1i;ukI1(h1, tor she will not 
use it, unless in coml)at witii a lival queen. She i-eeeives 
mai-ked attention from all tlie nu'inhers of hw family. 
Everyone raisin.i;- bees should seei< to IxH-onic familiar with 
the aj)i)earance of the (|ueen. Tlie workiii.i;- bee is smallci' 
than Die (|U(vn, and on it devolves all of llic labor. 'J'lie 
drone is the male bee ; swai-nis should not be ])ermit1ed to 
raise a iai'i^'e mimber of them, as it tak<'s a ^-I'eat deal of 
honey to I'ear a brood of di-oiics, and still more to suppoi't 
them in idleness foi* three or four nu)nths. 

Swarms with pi-olille (.luecns increase rapklly. If a .G'ood 
harvest of honey is desii'ed. it is necessary to have early 
swaj-ms to colh>ct it in the pi'oper season, and to do this 
eai'ly, breeding- must be encoui-a<;'ed. Upon this subject we 
cannot do belter than give the following- plan of a success- 
ful bee raiser : 

''How to control swarming is truly an important ques- 
tion. I believe that the successful controlling of swai'uiing 
is the key to success and proht in l)ee keeping. If swarms 
are desired, arrang-e in early spring- to have them issue in 
the swarming- season. When no swaj-ms are wanted, we 
turn the ^vhole force of bees to storing- suri)lus honey in 
suiall giass boxes thi'oug-hout tlu^ entire season, and having- 
no swarms, yet have the same inci-ease of bees that would 
l)e gained if they swarmed. Then all of the bees woik a1 
storing honey ui boxes, instead of swarming- out, if Judi- 
ciously fed, and furnished with ample box i-oom. If it is 
desired to have the bees swarm, keep them condned closely 
to their labors in the central or bi-ood section of the hive, 
which may be clone by poi-tions. If the swarm is wanted to 
come out at any particular time, r-emove the old (pieen ten 
days before the swarm is desired. The bees in the hive

will in iicaily cyvvy instance, construct queen cells im- 
iMe(li;il(>lv, to i'e[)lace the loss of llie other (|ueeu. A1 llie 
• ■ailiest possible moment tlu'v seem lo realize fullv Iheii- 
loss. Tliey usnally coiistruct a number ol' cells, lliev will 
hatch in about ten days, and then swarms will issue. If it 
is f)refei-i-ed to ]ia\'e no swarms veiy early in the spring-, put 
iti the boxes and ^We the bees access to them. By this 
coui'se but a small proportion will swarm." 

It should be plain to every intelligent person that in oi-der 
to receive the larg-est profits from bees they must be fed- 
It is as nec«?ssar3' ^^ i^ •« ^<> f^nnl our domestic stock. 

Many plans for feediuf^- are given, the following is 
highly recommended : 

"The fii'st warm days in spring-, mix corn meal, with rye 
meal, equal parts, and place near the hives. The bees will 
cany this to their hives in considerable quantities, it a nswers 
as a substitute for pollen oi' bee bread, and is essential in 
forwarding the increase of bees in the early spring-. Later, 
feed sugar, prepared by adding two cjuarts of water to 
eiglit pounds of white sugar, with the whites of two eg'g'S 
stirred in; boil g-ently and skim." 

Feeding- may be discontinued as soon as nature furnishes 
a supply of food. Almost every tree and plant yields honey 
to some extent. In hiving- bees, it is necessary to under- 
stand how to proceed, and all trouble may be avoided. If 
the bees after coming- from the old hive luive clustered on 
trees oi' bushes, place the hive on a table oi- stand, raise the 
bottom of the hive a little, so as to allow room for them to 
enter. Shade the hive well. Saw the limb or branch on 
which they have clustered, cai'ry it to the hive, and hold it 
down to the stand, as near the entrance as possible, slightly 
shake the bees o(T and they will at once go into the hive, 
and the work is done. 

Bees usually swarm between nine and one o'clock. 

There are other points necessary for the bee keeper to

CHAPTER XLVII. 

SILK CULTURE. 

In an ai^'o when self sustaiiiitii;- einployinent for women is 
attracting' so iiiucli atteiitioji, evei\\' btaiicli of woi'k suited 
to hej' especial use is rey-arded with interest. For many 
reasons the cultui-e of silk is well adapted to the require- 
ments of women and children, but as tlieorists have done 
mucli harm by fabulous calculations as to the pi'olits of 
sili\ culture, in i;-ivin,n- our views upon the subject, we desii'e 
to inii)ress on the minds of all those wishing' to en^'age in 
this bi'anch of industry, that the pi'olits are not lai\i;e to 
the individual, tlioui;'h it adds vast wealth to the nation 
[ji'oducin.n' it, for the reason that it can be pursued by the 
Inunblest and poorest with \'eiy little outlay. 

Anotiier error rci^'ardini^' the rearin.u' of silk-worms is, 
t hat tlie\- are no t i'oul)le, foi' it I'eiiuires l)oth time and atten- 
tion, if prolit is to i)e derived from them. 

In this article we have notsi)ace to yivi" a len.i^lhy treatise 
on this interesting subject, but will endeavor to convey the 
most impoi'tant information required foi- beginners. There 
arethousands of families in the south who would gladly add a 
few dollars to their annual income by giving light and easy 
employment for a few months in the year, to the aged and 
the young who have no other pi'olitable occupation. The 
mothers and daughters of the farm who devote April and 
May to the i-aising of cocoons may not earn as much as 
the fathers and bi-others in the cotton, corn and tobacco

ri(>lds, yet if thoy make soinclliiii^' to add lo the ,i;-(Mi«'ral 
iiic-onie, it is im[H)r1aiit . as it provides laboi- 1o tlios(3 iikmu- 
bcrs of tlu? family who liiM't'loforc had iioiic. 'riieii tlic 
ivariii,^- of a few sillc-woniis each year does not interfere 
with liouseliold duties; the thiii'y, llowtM'^'ardm and poultry 
yard can all be as sueeessfidly conducted willi or without 
sill\-wornis. Therefore silk culture oununcnds ilself to 
women and children as an occupation of an intclli,i;eid. and 
moral hearin.i;'. 

The silk-woi'in is the larva of a small moth known as the 
mulbeny silk-worm, aiul exists in four dillVrciit states — the 
og"S', the larva, chrysalis and adult. The e.i^'i^-s should Ix' 
procured in cold weatiier, and kepi at a sullicicntly low tem- 
perature to pn'\'ent them hatchin,i;' until the food is itikIn- 
and weal hei' suitable, then they should l)e kc[)t at a regular 
heat, sa\' ']'>'. when they will begin to hatch in live or six 
days. The leaves of the white nudberi'\' or ( )sa,ge oran,u'<' 
nuist then l)e gathered anti [)laced near the litt le insects. 
which should be in shallow paste-l)oard boxes. Mosfiuito 
netting- should be placed lightly ovei- the feeding boxes, 
and fresh leaves placed on them. The little worms will at 
once crawl through, and they can thus be removed fi-om tlie 
trash and dried leaves. 

Fresh leaves should be gathered two or three times a day. 
or as often as they appear wi-lted, the firmness of the co- 
coons antl texture of the silk depends greatly on the fi-e- 
quency of feeding, hence attention should be given the 
matter, the first feed should be given at foni- oi- (i\e o'clock 
in the morning, aiul the last, at eleven or tw(>l\-e at night. 
Care should be taken to spread the leaves evenly, so that 
all may feed alike. 

As the fifth or sixth day approaches, signs of the fii'st 
moult begins to be noticed. Tht^ little worms begin to lose 
their appetite, and some dark spots appear above the liead. 

Feedmg should now be discontinued, and the boxes made

a small bouquet being- inserted foi- each plate.

COOKING SCHOOL. 



Of kite years a <x\va\ deal niori' interest seems to lie taken 
ill cooking' than foi'nicrly. ( 'ookin,ii' Seliools ha\e !»i'cii 
formed in New York aiul otiief pkiees, aiitl may [XM'liaps hf 
said to have exercised a \'ei'y Ix'nedciai intluenee on the 
I'isin^' generation of young housekeepers. Some of the in- 
structors seem to tlirow a sort of charm about the matter 
of fact metliods of cooking, giving to the art a fascination 
wliicli tloes not usually belong to it. 

Ladies will waste their time ovei- fancy work, and yet 
allow their families to suH'ei" before they will go into the 
kitchen and learn liow to cook practically, so that they 
may be able at least to givt; intclligerit tlirections (^'en if 
they do not wish to do some moi'e themselves. 

Everybody enjoys a good meal, projiei'ly cooked, and nice- 
ly served, and yet how indilVerently in many families where 
dependence is placed entiivly upon ordinary cooks, are 
these things done. 

One dilhculty witli the rtnipes often found in cook- 
books, is that inex[)erienced housekeepers ai'e una 1)1*^ to 
comprehend exactly wliat shoidd be done with them. 
The ingredients of coui-se they can obtain, but how to 
use them, that is, the successive steps in tlie operation 
from beginning to end. they do not undei-stand. 

In the New York Cooking School the instructor entei's 



into details so that wIkmi she anal^

almost any intelligent person can comprehend every step.

method of telling whethei- cake was done or not was suf-

After removing the cake from the oven the inst ructor placed 
it to her ear, and stated that during the ()[)eration of bak- 
ing, a peculiar surging sound could be heard, which was 
caused by the escape of the steam tVom the minute cells of 
the dough, and that wIumi it had baked sulliciently, this 
sound would cease, or would be very faint. 

In introducing" the butter into the lilling of one of her 
cakes, she added a small |)ortion at a time, taken with the 
point of a knife from the tablesi)oon used in measuring it, 
stirring- it in until all was added. Tliis method was pursued, 
it was explained, to prevent the butter from oiling, as it 
would do if added all at once.

Tlic method pni'sucd in roiiioviiit;- cal<o from the pan

Fi^-ui-es 1, 2 and '.'>. A piece of tin considerably lar^-er llian 
the pan in which the cake is baked is pi'ovided. This is 
placed on top of the pan, as shown in Fii;-. 1, then by a 
quick movement the pan with the tin is turned upside 
down, wliich leaves tlie cake lyin^ upon the tin, as in Fi^', 
;*. Then bv i-eversin^' the pan the cake is placed on the 
bottom, as s^'own in Fii^-. 3. 

A double boiler is used foi" cookinf^- filling- for cake, and 
also for frosting', as shown in illustration on page 503.

It is somethinjO' of a knack as every cook knows to separate 
the yolk fi'om the white of an egg-, and do it neatly and 
with dispatch. The artist, in the illustration presentcnl 
on page ')(]<), conveys a very g-ood idea of the manner in 
which this operation is performed. 

The method also of ''creaming butter" as it is called, 
is shown quite plainly in the illustration presented on page 
570. 

The flour sifter used, is probably not very much difl'erent 
from a large number of similar siftei-s in the market. Tlie

you do not get the same sweetness as is the case when 
water is used. There is a great denl of sweetness when a 
mixture is made with water, especially when yeast is used. 
Yeast changes the character of the milk. When yeast and 
eggs and milk and butter are used in bread, it always has 
a sort of cheesv taste. The fermentation causes this.

the melted butter. When cool add the floui', salt, su^ur 
and yeast, which has been dissolved in fom- tal)lespoonfuls 
of water. Let the mixtui-e rise ovei-ni^ht and cook the 
same as ^-riddle cakes. Indian meal I'cciuires a very

because I had the sour cream and the time. Take six

cream — it will be better if you can have it sour, but sour or 
sweet will do — one cupful of lard or butter, two eg-gs, one

"It varies g-reatly. In cream or milk that has been kept

I remem\)er a young lady who canw^ here a few years 
ago. She was going to be married and, of course, had a 
great many things on her mind. She was one of the 
bright, young women of New York, and knew a great deal 
of literature and other things. She came to see me the 
other day. I felt sorry for her. A great many people 
come here for whom I feel more or less sorry, but I felt 
particularly sorry for this young lady, because she belongs 
to a rich family and has plenty , and yet with it all ther(^ 
was this complaint. She said : "I am a piM-fect numskull. 
I know when we have a good thing, but I do not know why 
it is right." Of course, the larger the establishment the 
more complicated the duties. The young Avoman who 
marries in moderate circumstances gimerally has plenty of 
tinie to learn, and it is her own fault if she does not learn 
and learn properly too. If you wish to be a good house- 
keeper you must begin at the beginning. You must learn 
all about the plain things first and take up the fancy dishes 
afterwards.

to beat them comparatively light, but not llaky. That is 
one of the di (Terences between onu>lets iuade i-ight and 
omelets made bad. A good omelet \y\]\ not be solid; it 
will be creamy all through. An omelet may be light and 
yet be poor. It may not be hard, but it is diy. It has no 
flavor. The eggs have been beaten loo light. 

A great many p(H)ple boat the whites and yolks separate- 
ly, hut although you may have a pretty-looking omelet you 
will have no flavor to it. Add the salt and milk. Have 
1li(^ pan very hot, put in a spoonful of butter, pour in the 
eggs, shake vigorou.sly until the eggs begin to thicken, 
then wait a few seconds, just to brown it a little, and roll 
up. Be careful not to wait minutes, but seconds ; the (piick- 
est thing you can possibly imagine. Now, the mixing of 
your eggs and all that sort of thing is nothing as compared

Selt'ci a nico, smooth spot, anil drive a pe^- in the ^roniiil 
for a ciMilrc, then willi a short, piece, anil with another sticU 
for a marker, describe a eircle around this centre of six or 
seven feet diameter. Then with an ii'on bar set l)ean poles, 
leanin<i- a little inward, eig'ht or ten inches apart, around 
tlie circle, leavinf;* a space npon the shady sich' for entrance, 
say two feet wide. Brin^- the poles to^et her at t he top, and 
tie each one in such a manner that they will appear as even 
as possible; two or three may he left loni^ci' than the 
rest, and extend upwards if you choose. Take strips of 
ordinai-y sawed lath which are usually four feet in len;nth; 
sharpen one end and drive them into the ;n'round dia^^onally, a 
few inches in dept h, Justoutside the poles. Bend themaroniul 
and spring- tlie end of each under about the fourth pole from 
the one by which it is driven. Describe another circle about 
a foot inside the poles, and stick another row of lath upon 
this cii'cle slanting' in the o[)posite direction, and leaning- 
outwai'd so as to touch upon tlu' poles at the same point 
with the outside row. With brad awl ;iiid No. ') nails, 
fasten the up|)ei" ends of the lath to tin* |)oles. 'I'he space 
between the two rows of laths is to be i)lanted with climb- 
ers of various kinds; such as scai'let I'unnei's, hyacinths, 
bean, etc. The two rows of lath will |)revent the little feet 
from dislurl)in^' the roots of the plants, aiul add nuich to 
the beauty of the struct ui'e. This could be sui'iuounted by 
a bird house.

EXPERT TESTIMONY. 

From Urs. A. A. QEDDES, Teacher of Cooking. 

I lin\p iiseil Hcirsford's UakiiiR Powder for tlic last six monlhs. 1 have tistcd it thorough- 
ly, and have wiTvv failed to ^ct good rt'sidts, when the directions were fully carried out. 1 
consider it equal to any in the market, and second to none. 

I take much pleasure in recommending; it to my conkiiij; classes, and to my friends gencr- 
ally. ALICE A. CKDbKS, ^..2 Inman Street, Cambridge, Mass. 

Prom MARION HARLAND, The well-known Authority on Cooking. 

I cheerfully commend the " llakinvr Preparations " of I'rofessor Ilorsford to the House- 
keepers of America. They deserve as honorable a place in the store-room and kitchen as does 
his Acid Phosphate in the family medicine-chest. MARION HARI.ANU. 

From Miss FARLOA, of the Famous Boston Cooking School. 

I have used Horsford's Baking Preparation with perfect success, for l?read, liiscuit and 
Cake. M. PARI.OA.
