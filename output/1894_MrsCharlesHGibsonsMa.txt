PREFACE. 



IN the selection and arrangement of the recipes contained 
in this volume, the compiler has chosen those known to her, 
from actual and long experience, to be the best and most 
economical. Every one knows how desirable and important 
it is to both health and comfort, that the food for the daily use 
of a family and its guests should be properly prepared. Phy- 
sicians will tell you that all food which is not properly pre- 
pared and cooked is both indigestible and unhealthy, and is 
often the source of many of the ailments we complain of. 
The recipes in this book have been selected with the greatest 
care, and will aid all housekeepers in preparing wholesome 
food and tempting delicacies for their daily requirements. 
In other words, it is the "art of coqking_made__easy." A 
fair trial of them will convince anyone that the wide field 
embraced within this book comprises all that is useful and 
valuable, both to the lady of the house and her cook, who, if 
unskilled, will find the assistance herein rendered of great 
comfort. Most of the recipes are my own, or such as I have 
-used for years, and taken from old books that have never been 
printed, and were known only to some of the best house- 
keepers in Maryland and Virginia. Those who have con- 
tributed to fill these pages are known to me as excellent 
housekeepers, whose recipes I am glad to add to my own. 



VI PREFACE. 

In placing my book before the public I feel that I have a 
right to claim a like indulgence to those who, before me, 
have given to the world the benefit of their experience, and I 
feel confident that my " Cook Book," being the result of an 
experience of twenty years, will meet with a just reward.

MRS. CHAS. H. GIBSON'S COOK BOOK. 



RULES FOR BREAD AND CAKE MAKING. 



IT requires experience to become a good bread-maker. You 
must know when the bread has risen enough. Of course this 
depends upon the weather. In warm summer weather, bread 
made up at twelve o'clock in the day is ready for tea by seven 
o'clock. In winter, set it to rise, if for breakfast, by eight 
o'clock in the evening, and put it away, covered, in a warm 
place. In the morning, work it over again, and set it to rise 
for at least an hour and a half before breakfast, setting it near 
the fire, and letting it rise to the top of the pan. If for tea, 
make it up by eight o'clock in the morning in winter, and work 
it over about four in the afternoon. If you have too much 
dough for breakfast take out a piece before the second rising, 
and put it on ice until wanted to rise again. Potatoes will 
always improve bread. For baking, the oven should be rather 
hot and the doors closed, except when necessary to look at the 
bread. Any sudden draught on the oven affects the baking of 
bread or cake. These rules apply equally to pastry. For cake, 
always beat eggs separately and cream the butter thoroughly. 
When cream of tartar, or soda, or yeast powder is used, the oven 
should be heated very hot ; if these ingredients are not used, 
have slow heat. Whenever a recipe calls for soda use some acid, 
either sour milk or cream of tartar, with it. Soda should always 
be dissolved in something, either milk or water, and cream of

Z RULES FOR BREAD AND CAKE MAKING. 

tartar sifted with the flour. It is always well to sift flour 
twice. A little ammonia will improve cake, making it lighter. 
To test when a cake is done, run a dry broom straw down 
into it. If the straw comes out perfectly dry the cake is done; 
but if it is the least moist, or if any particles stick to it, it is 
not done. For loaves, always put thin, greased paper in the 
bottom and sides of the pan. In summer time, before making 
cake, put the eggs on ice, to keep them cool and fresh, other- 
wise they will not beat up light. 

For icing, always use pulverized sugar, beat very slowly, 
and a long time. 

Eggs should always be beaten thoroughly ; the whites to a 
stiff froth, and the yolks to a light color. The fresher the 
eggs, the better they will beat up. 

HOW TO MAKE YEAST, No. i. 

Steep an eighth of an ounce of pressed, or a small handful 
of loose hops in a quart of boiling water for about five minutes. 
Strain the boiling infusion upon half a pint of flour, stirred 
to a smooth paste with a little cold water. Mix well, boil a 
minute ; then add one ounce of salt and two ounces of white 
sugar. When lukewarm stir in a gill of liquid yeast or an 
ounce cake of compressed yeast dissolved in warm water. Let 
stand twenty-four hours, stirring occasionally, then cover 
closely, and set in a cool place. Yeast made in this manner 
will keep sweet for two weeks in summer, and much longer 
in winter, and can be used at any time during that period for 
starting a fresh supply of yeast, as well as for making bread. 

DRY YEAST. 

Take half a pint of meal, and mix it with water about as 
warm as is used to make up light bread or rolls. Make it 
about as stiff as corn bread for kitchen use ; add half a cake 
of yeast. It will lighten in just the same time as other yeast. 



RULES FOR BREAD AND CAKE MAKING. 3 

Use it wet if preferred, or stir more meal in it ; let it stand a 
few hours more, and make it into cakes to dry. 

MRS. CHARLES H. GIBSON'S VERY BEST HOP AND 
POTATO YEAST. 

Take four large or eight small potatoes, wash clean, leaving 
on the skin, let them lie in cold water for half an hour, then put 
on to boil with three quarts of boiling water, and one dessert 
spoonful of compressed hops, or a small handful of loose hops. 
Let all boil until the potatoes are done, then pour the water 
off, remove the skins, take out the hops, and mash the potatoes 
very smooth, adding the water the potatoes and hops has been 
boiled in. If much water has boiled away, add more boiling 
water, so as to have nearly three quarts. Let this mixture cool, 
then add one teacup of white sugar, one of salt, one teaspoonful 
of powdered alum, and three cakes of Warner's Compressed 
Yeast, dissolved in lukewarm water; or one teacupful of good 
liquid yeast, but I much prefer Warner's Compressed Yeast. 
Set it in a pan or earthen jar, with a cover on it, by the fire in 
winter, to rise, away from the fire in summer. When it has 
risen well, which it ought to do by 6 o'clock in the afternoon in 
summer if made up by 10 A. M. (in winter it takes longer), stir 
well and bottle. This yeast will keep on ice two weeks in 
warm weather and longer in cold. 

DUTCH YEAST. 

Take two quarts of water, put in a handful of hops, and let 
them boil twenty minutes. Have ready four large potatoes 
well mashed. Strain the hop liquor, and pour it on the pota- 
toes. Add one teacup of Indian meal and one teacup of flour. 
Set it on the fire, and let it boil a few minutes. Then let it 
cool, and when it is milk warm put in one tablespoonful of 
sugar, one of salt, and half a pint of yeast. The next day 
bottle it tight. Be particular to stir it all the time it is on 
the fire. 



4 TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 

POTATO YEAST, No. 2 (without Hops). 

Take four large old potatoes, peel and let them lie in cold 
water half an hour ; then grate the potatoes into two pints of 
boiling water ; add one-half teacupful of granulated sugar and 
two large tablespoonsful of salt. Boil for ten minutes, stir- 
ring all the time. When cool, set to rise, adding either one 
cake of compressed yeast dissolved in milk-warm water or one 
teacupful of potato yeast, if perfectly sweet. 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND 
MEASURES. 



The following is a very valuable housewife's table, by 
which persons, not having scales and weights at hand, may

BREAD. 



POTATO ROLLS. 

Four large potatoes boiled, and mashed through a cullender, 
one quart of flour, three ounces of butter, three eggs beaten 
light, one coffee cup full of yeast, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
of white sugar. 

Sift the flour. Put it in the bowl it is to rise in. Mash 
the potatoes while hot into it, and work them in with the 
butter, until quite smooth. Add the eggs, then the salt and 
sugar, and the yeast. Knead well on the board, as you do 
bread, and set it to rise. In summer, set it at twelve o'clock 
for tea ; in winter, at eleven o'clock. About an hour before 
tea, turn it out on the board dredged with flour. Don't work 
it at all, but flour lightly, and roll it out, half an inch thick. 
Cut in rouud cakes, and set it to rise in the pan they are 
to be baked in without touching. Bake like rolls. They 
are done in fifteen minutes. 

BRANDON CORN BREAD. 

Take two teacups of small hominy. Boil it well, aud while 
hot, stir in a tablespoonful of butter. Beat four eggs very 
light, stir them into the hominy, add gradually a pint of milk 
and half a pint of white corn meal. The batter should be 
about as thick as boiled custard. 

Bake for one hour in a deep pan, to allow for rising, and 
with a good deal of heat at the bottom. Either rice or hominy 
can be used in this recipe. 

7 



BREAD. 



BATTER BREAD. 

Five eggs, one quart of milk, one pint of flour, as much 
meal as will make it a thick batter; one spoonful of lard. 

DROP BISCUIT. 

One quart of flour, one pint of sour cream or buttermilk. 
Three eggs, half a teacup of melted butter, one teaspoonful of 
soda, in the cream. Stir well together and drop with a spoon 
into a pan. 

CRUMPETS. 

One quart of warm milk made into a batter, with the yolks 
of three or four eggs. A piece of butter the size of a walnut, 
a little salt, about two spoonsful of good yeast. Beat well 
together and set to rise over night for breakfast. The batter 
must be rather thicker than pancake batter. The griddle for 
baking made pretty hot, and well greased. 

They are quite good made of bread in the morning, if you 
make it of the proper consistency, with warm milk and eggs. 
Set it in a warm place, and they will soon rise, and require 
no extra yeast. The more they are beaten the better. 

FLANNEL CAKES. 

Five eggs, one pint of milk, one and one-half pints of flour, 
one spoonful of butter, and two of yeast. Set to rise. 

QUICK BISCUIT. 

One quart sifted flour, one teaspoonful salt, one-half pint 
milk, one large spoonful lard, two heaping teaspoonsful of 
Royal Baking Powder or a half-teaspoonful of soda and one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Put the baking powder, or cream of tartar and soda, and 
salt into the flour and sift it again. Then rub into this, the 
lard. Now see that the oven is very hot (400 Fahr.). 



BREAD. 9 

Grease the pans and get the cutter and rolling pin. Have 
everything ready before you put in the milk, then add the 
milk and knead up quickly. Roll out on the board one inch 
thick, cut with a small round cutter, put quickly into the pans 
and then into the oven. Bake twenty minutes. Remember, 
to have them a success, handle as little and make as rapidly, 
as possible. 

Make Rye Biscuit as above, except use one pint of rye flour 
and one pint of wheat flour, instead of one quart wheat flour. 

RATCLIFFE RUSKS. 

Two teacupsful of potatoes, mashed through a cullender, 
four eggs beaten light, one teacupful butter, one of milk, two 
of yeast, one pound white sugar, and flour enough to work it 
out. Warm the butter and milk together. Lastly add the 
yeast, and set to rise at night. Work it out next morning 
into rolls Set it to rise before baking. Cover with white of 
egg, sugar and cinnamon. If compressed yeast, use one-half 
cake. 

RUSKS. 

Two quarts flour, six eggs, three-quarters of a pound sugar, 
one-half pound butter, one pint milk. Flavor with cinnamon 
or nutmeg. White of egg, sugar and cinnamon over the top. 
One teacup liquid yeast, or- one-half cake compressed. 

BATH RUSKS. 

Seven eggs, one pound sugar, one ounce butter, one pint 
new milk warmed with the sugar. Make into a batter the 
consistency of flannel cakes, with one cup of yeast, or one- 
half cake compressed yeast. Let it rise six hours. Make a 
dough not very stiff. Set to rise again, and make into rolls. 
Egg, sugar and cinnamon on top. Flavor with nutmeg or 
cinnamon. This quantity will take about five pints of flour, 
and makes a great amount. 



10 BREAD. 



RUSKS. 

Two pounds ten ounces of flour, one pound of sugar, 
ten ounces of butter and lard mixed, yolks of two eggs, 
white of one, one pint milk, one and a half cups of yeast,

sugar and butter into the flour, then beat the eggs, yeast, 
milk, nutmegs, a little salt, and a half pint of mashed pota- 
toes in the middle of the flour, and leave it to rise all night. 
In the morning work it up with two ounces of flour, which 
should be left out at night, and put it in rolls to rise a 
second time in the oven. 

RATCLIFFE ROLLS. 

Two quarts of flour, one pint boiled milk (but it must only 
be lukewarm when used). One tablespoonful of butter, one 
dessert-spoonful of sugar, a small teacupful of home-made 
hop yeast, or one-half cake compressed yeast, and a little salt. 
Sift the flour twice, put it in a bowl, make a hole in 
the centre, and place the sugar, butter, milk and yeast 
there. Mix all thoroughly with the flour, and knead it 
well for fifteen minutes, then set it to rise. Next morning 
knead it again, and make it out in turnover rolls. Do 
not let them touch in the baking pan. 

BRENTFORD ROLLS. 

Make a sponge with a pint of milk, and set to rise at night. 
Then take three pints of flour, a teacupful of white sugar, one 
quarter pound butter, arid one egg. Mix these in the flour, 
and then work in the sponge. Knead it for twenty or thirty 
minutes, then make into rolls. Put them in pans, let them 
rise two or three hours, then bake in a quick oven. Lard 
will do instead of butter. One-half cake of compressed yeast, 
or one teacupful of liquid yeast. Very nice. 



BREAD. 11 

RATCLIFFE LOAF BREAD, No. i. 

One and a half pounds of flour, two large spoonsful of liquid 
yeast or one-half cake of compressed yeast, one large potato 
boiled and mashed smooth, piece of lard size of an egg. Mix

Make in loaves ; work well at night and again in morning. 

SPOON ROLLS. 

Six eggs well beaten, one quart of flour, four tablespoonsful 
of yeast, or one-quarter cake of compressed yeast, or enough 
butter and milk warmed together to make a thick batter. 
Beat all well. Drop it in the oven with a spoon, or what 
is better, bake in small pans with a quick heat. Very nice. 

PUFFETS. 

Two pints flour, one pint milk, two eggs, a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, one teaspoonful of soda, and two of cream 
of tartar, or two teaspoonsful of Royal Baking Powder. Sift 
the cream of tartar in the flour, and dissolve the soda in the 
milk. Beat the butter and eggs together, then add the flour 
and milk. Bake in muffin rings in a quick oven. 

WHITE OF EGG MUFFINS. 

Whites of eight eggs beaten stiff. A full pint of flour. 
Milk enough to make the batter as thick as batter pudding. 
Add a little salt, and bake quickly. 

CREAM MUFFINS. 

One quart flour, three eggs, one cup of cream. A piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Milk enough to make a thick 
batter, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the cream, if sour. 
If not, add two teaspoonsful of cream of tartar just before 
baking, or two teaspoonsful of Royal Baking Powder. 



12 BREAD. 



WATER MUFFINS. 

Stir four tablespoonsful of fresh yeast, or one-quarter cake 
of compressed yeast, in one pint of milk-warm water, add a 
small teaspoonful of salt, then stir in gradually as much flour 
as will make a thick batter. Cover it, and set it to rise. 
When it is light, heat the griddle, grease it, and put on the 
rings. Put in each ring a spoonful of batter, and bake over 
a quick fire. 

MUFFIN BREAD. 

Three pints flour, half pint of milk and half pint of warm 
water mixed, one-half cake of yeast, or if liquid yeast use one 
teacupful, and a little salt. Mix all together at night, leaving 
out one pint of flour, to be added in the morning when it is 
light. Then set it aside for the second rising. When risen, 
bake. 

MUFFINS. 

One quart of warm milk, half pound of butter, and six eggs 
well beaten. Work the flour in till it is stiff enough for a 
spoon to stand up in. Half pint of good yeast, or one-half 
cake compressed yeast. After they have risen in the morning, 
do not beat the batter up. Dip the spoon in cold water, and 
take up as much batter as will nearly fill the rings. Let them 
rise a little before baking, and do not bake too long, or they 
will be hard. This is enough for a large company. 

DELICIOUS CORN WAFFLES. 

One teacup of flour ; one teaspoonful Royal Baking Powder ; 
one and a half cups of cold boiled rice ; one and a half table- 
spoonsful of melted butter; one-half teaspoonful of salt; four

One quart sifted corn meal, a piece of lard the size of an 
egg, a little salt, and warm water enough to mix it, so you 
can spread it on the board. Bake before a hot fire. If you 
have no board for the purpose, and no open fire, bake in 
biscuit tins, smoothing it thin with the hand. 

BACHELOR'S LOAF.

One and a half pounds of flour, quarter of a pound of lard, 
a pinch of salt. Mix enough milk and water to make a stiff 
dough. Beat the dough with an axe for half an hour, until

into small biscuits, prick with a fork several times, and bake 
quickly. 

BREAD CAKES. 

Soak a pint of stale bread (crumbled) in a pint of sweet 
milk, over night. Next morning strain it through a cullender

2 



18 BREAD. 

Work it well. Put the butter or lard in the flour, then mash 
the potatoes, mix with the eggs and other ingredients. Pour 
all into the flour and set to rise. 

MILK TOAST. 

Boil one quart of milk and stir into it three ounces of but- 
ter, mixed with one teaspoon ful of corn-starch and one salt 
spoonful of salt. Let the whole boil five minutes. Have 
ready a few slices of toast, pour the milk over them, and send 
it to the table hot. This is generally a breakfast dish, but is 
nice for supper also. 

RICE CAKES. 

Soak half a pound of rice over night. Next morning boil 
it soft, drain and add quarter of a pound of butter, and let it 
get cool. When cold stir in one quart milk. Beat six eggs, 
sift half a pint of flour. Stir the eggs and flour alternately 
into the rice and milk. Beat well, and bake on a griddle. 
Butter them and serve hot. Two teaspoonsful Royal Baking 
Powder. 

RYE DROP CAKES. 

One pint of milk, three eggs, one tablespoonful of sugar, 
one salt spoonful of salt. Stir in the flour until about the 
consistency of pancakes (about three cups). Beat the whites 
of the eggs separately, and add them the last thing. This 
makes the akes lighter. Bake in buttered cups or saucers 
half an hour. 

MUFFIN LOAF. 

One quart of boiled milk, one ounce of lard put in the milk 
while it is hot. Four eggs, well beaten, added to the milk 
when cold. Sift in flour, till it is a little thicker than muffin 
batter. After the flour is well mixed add one-half a cake of 
yeast. In warm weather, make it up at eleven o'clock in the 
morning for tea. It must be put in the shape to rise one hour 
before baking. 



BREAD. 19 

FRENCH BREAD. 

Take six pounds flour and put it on the board. Make a 
hole in the middle, in which put two teacups of yeast, or one 
cake compressed yeast. Make the dough with warm water, 
not very stiff. Work it up well, adding two ounces of salt 
dissolved in a little warm water. Cover and set it in a warm 
place to rise. The quality of the bread depends on this part 
of the operation. Having left the dough one or two hours 
(according to the season) knead it again, and leave it as before 
for two hours. In the meanwhile heat the oven, divide the 
dough into eight loaves, bake in Vienna bread pans, and put 
them in the oven as quickly as possible. 

BONNY CLABBER CAKES. 

Break one egg into a dish, put in one pint of bonny clabber, 
one pint of flour, with a little salt. Add one teaspoonful of 
soda. 

WASHINGTON'S BREAKFAST BREAD. 

Five pints of flour, one pint of new milk, three eggs 
one spoonful of butter, two spoonsful of yeast, or one-half 
cake compressed yeast. Beat all well together, and set to 
rise. When light, bake. 

MILK RISING BREAD. 

To one pint of new milk add enough boiling water to make 
it warm. Beat in as much flour as will make a thick batter. 
Sprinkle a little dry flour over it, and set it to rise for about 
two hours, then add flour enough for rolls or loaves. 

BREAD MUFFINS. 

Make the dough up at night, as you would for loaf-bread. 
In the morning work well and break off in pieces a little 
larger than for biscuits. Roll rather thin and set to rise 
an hour and a half, bake on the top of the stove, and turn 



20 BREAD. 

over as you would other cakes. They will bake in a very 
few minutes. 

POTATO MUFFINS. 

Four eggs, one cup butter and lard mixed, one pint mashed 
potatoes, one cup yeast, or one-half cake compressed yeast, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, flour sufficient to make a stiffbatter, then 
let it rise, and make it into a dough as stiff as you would for 
light biscuit. Let it rise again, then make into muffins in pans, 
or cut it out and set it to rise. Bake in a quick oven. These 
are delicious for tea. 

TEA CAKE. 

Take light dough, roll it about an inch thick, stick raisins 
over it. Make a mixture of cinnamon, butter and sugar, and 
spread in a thin layer over the dough. Note. I generally 
set the dough to rise after rolling and placing in the pans, 
then cover with the raisins and the mixture. Put it in the 
stove and bake as bread. Cut into squares. Very nice. 

MUFFINS. 

One pint milk, three eggs, a little salt. Make a batter 
about as thick as sponge cake batter, with flour. Beat the 
whites very light. This cake is to be baked as muffins for 
breakfast. One teaspoon ful of Royal Baking Powder. 

SUET CAKES. 

Chop suet fine, pour over it scalding water, let it stand 
until cool enough to work in the flour. Knead in flour 
lightly, roll it thin, cut them out, and bake them quickly. 
Serve up hot. One teaspoonful of salt. 

ORANGE CAKE. 

One quart flour, one cup butter, four eggs, two spoonsful 
yeast, or one-half cake compressed yeast, or one-half teacup of 
liquid yeast. Make in a stiff batter the night before with 



BREAD. 21 

milk. Next morning add a teacupful of meal finely sifted. 
Beat it well, and pour it in cups to rise. 

BRAN BREAD. 

Rub one teaspoonful of salt, and very thoroughly two tea- 
spoonsful of cream of tartar, in one quart of bran flour ; then 
add two scant tablespoonsful of molasses, and mix in sufficient 
new milk to make a stiff batter. Dissolve one teaspoonful of 
soda in two tablespoonsful of cold water, and stir in thoroughly 
and quickly. Bake slowly one hour. This will keep fresh 
and moist three days, and is relished by those who cannot eat 
graham bread prepared in other ways. 

BROWN BREAD. 

To two quarts of corn meal allow a teacupful of boiling 
water, one quart graham flour, four tablespoonsful of strong 
hop yeast, or one-half cake compressed yeast, one tablespoonful 
of salt, one teacupful of molasses, and one quart of lukewarm 
water. Scald one quart of the corn meal with the boiling 
water, add the lukewarm water, and then stir in gradually the 
other quart of meal and the graham flour, add the other in- 
gredients, the yeast last, and set it to rise. When light bake 
in a quick oven. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

To two pounds of graham flour allow one pint of milk, one 
pint of water, one wineglass of molasses, one teaspoonful of 
salt, and two tablespoonsful of liquid strong yeast, or one-half 
cake compressed yeast. Beat the yeast, molasses, soda and salt 
in lukewarm water and milk. Stir in the flour until too stiff 
to use a spoon. Knead and bake as usual. 

RYE BREAD. 

Make a rather stiff mush of corn meal, boiling it long and 
well ; salt to taste. When milk-warm stir in yeast in just 
the proportion for wheat sponge. In cool weather this must 



22 BREAD. 

be done over night, and in the morning, when light, work in 
as much rye flour as the sponge will hold. Do not get it too 
stiff, for it will adhere to the hands, even when stiff enough, 
and unlike wheat dough its stickiness is not a sign of the need 
of more flour. Let the dough rise, and do not attempt to 
mould it, but pour into well buttered tins. 

RYE BREAD (Steamed). 

Haifa pint rye meal unsifted, one pint of sifted corn meal, the 
same quantity of sour milk, half a gill of molasses, one teaspoon- 
ful salt, and a large tablespoonful of soda, dissolved in a little 
warm water. Stir well together, adding the soda last. Steam it 
for four hours. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Make a thin mush of corn meal, cooking it ten minutes ; 
let it become perfectly cool before putting the cakes to rise. 
In mixing the cakes take a pint of the mush to a quart of 
buckwheat flour; add water and yeast as in ordinary cakes 
made of buckwheat. Making a mush of the corn meal pre- 
vents the raw taste there always is when the meal is put in 
uncooked. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Half a cake of yeast, one tablespoonful of salt, and one of 
brown sugar; one teacup of flour or meal, one quart of buck- 
wheat. Mix all with warm water, and beat well when you 
make them. Stir one tablespoonful of molasses in before 
baking, after beating down the batter. 

MUFFINS. 

The nicest muffins are made in this simple fashion : Early 
in the morning take a piece of light bread dough, and thin 
this to the consistency of batter by adding sweet milk. After 
beating it till smooth let it rise all together for an hour, then 
upon a buttered griddle drop the batter from a spoon, and as 



BREAD. 23 

soon as it is lightly brown turn it over. To be served up hot, 
and torn open, not cut open. 

VIRGINIA RICE BREAD. 

Take one teacup of rice and boil it well. This will, when 
boiled, make one pint. Stir into the rice while warm one 
spoonful of lard or butter, and some salt. Take three eggs, 
beat whites and yolks separately, one pint of milk, half a pint 
of meal. Mix the yolks and milk together, add the rice, and 
last of all the whites. Butter the dish and put the batter in, 
filling the dish as full as it will hold, as it bakes better. 

FRIED CORN MUSH FOR BREAKFAST. 

Corn mush is made by sprinkling corn meal into well-salted 
boiling water (a pint of corn meal to three pints of water) and 
cooking it well. But corn meal mush is much lighter, and 
when fried for breakfast, browns better, by cooking it as 
follows. Put one quart of water on to boil. Stir a pint of 
cold milk with one pint of corn meal and one teaspoonful of 
salt. When the water boils pour in the mixture gradually, 
stirring all well together. Let it boil for half an hour, 
stirring often, to prevent it from burning. To have it fried 
for breakfast it must be thoroughly cooked and made the day 
before. When cold, slice it, dip each slice in beaten egg 
(salted) and bread or cracker crumbs, and fry in boiling hot 
lard. 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. 

Take one heaping cup of oatmeal to one quart of boiling 
water and one teaspoonful of salt. Boil twenty minutes. The 
water should be salted and boiling, and the meal sprinkled in 
with one hand, while it is lightly stirred in with the other. 
When all mixed let it boil, but only stir it occasionally to 
keep it from burning at the bottom and to mingle the grains 
two or three times, so that all may be evenly cooked. If 



24 BREAD. 

much stirred the porridge will be starchy or waxy, and poor 
in flavor. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

One quart buckwheat, one quarter of a pound graham 
flour, one pint sifted corn meal, one iron spoonful white flour, 
a little salt. Mi^ with two iron spoonsful of yeast, and tepid 
milk and water to a thick batter. Beat well, and set to rise 
twelve hours before it is to be used. Add two spoonsful dark 
molasses, to make them bake a nice brown. Use either one- 
half cake compressed yeast, or one-half teacup of liquid yeast. 

GRAHAM BISCUIT. 

Three cups of graham and one of white flour, three cups of 
milk, two tablespoon sful lard, one of white sugar (heaping), 
one salt spoon of salt, one teaspoonful soda, and two of cream 
of tartar. Mix and bake as you do soda.biscuit. 

MINUTE BISCUIT. 

One pint sour milk or buttermilk, one teaspoonful soda, 
two of melted butter, and flour to make a soft dough, just stiff 
enough to handle. Mix, roll and cut out quickly, with as 
little handling as possible, and bake in a quick oven. 

CRUMPETS (Sweet). 

One pint raised dough, three eggs, three tablespoonsful 
butter, and half a cup of white sugar. When the bread has 
passed its second rising, work into the above-named quantity 
the butter (melted), then the eggs and sugar, beaten together till 
very light. Bake in muffin rings for about twenty minutes. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

Three cups brown flour, three of rye flour, one of corn meal, 
one cup molasses, four sweet milk, two teaspoonsful of soda. 
Mix all together ; salt enough to season. Bake one hour ; if 
the loaves are pretty thick, bake a little longer.

ROAST FILLET OF VEAL. 

Take out the bone of the joint, make a deep incision between 
the fillet and the flap, then fill it with stuffing, made as fol- 
lows : Two cupsful of bread-crumbs, half a cupful of chopped 
pork, peel (grated) of half a lemon, a little of the juice, sum- 
mer savory, thyme or any herb to taste. Or it may be filled 
with a veal stuffing as follows : Haifa pound of bread (with- 
out the crust) in tepid water, then squeeze it dry. Put three 
ounces of butter into a stew-pan, and when hot stir in a small 
onion, minced ; color it slightly. Then add the bread, three 
tablespoon sful of parsley chopped fine, half a teaspoonful of 
powdered thyme, a little grated nutmeg, pepper, salt, and a 
gill of stock. Stir it over the fire till it leaves the bottom and 
sides, then mix in two eggs. After stuffing bind the veal into 
a round form, fasten it with skewers and twine, sprinkle over 
it pepper and salt, and cover it with buttered paper. Be 
careful not to put the meat too near the fire at first. Baste 
well and often. Just before it is done remove the paper, 
sprinkle over it a little flour, and rub over it a little butter. 
This will give a frothy appearance to the surface of the meat. 
When done, put the pan of gravy on the fire, add a little flour, 
some boiling water, and when cooked, some lemon juice. 
Strain it, remove the grease, and pour it around the roast. 
Fry some pieces of ham cut in diamond shape ; place these in 
a circle around the roast, alternately, with slices of lemon. 

25 



26 MEATS. 

BROILED VEAL CUTLETS. 

Rib cutlets should always be trimmed, and the bone scraped 
at the end, so that it will look smooth and white. Broil them 
on a moderate fire, basting them occasionally with butter, and 
turning them often. Dish them in a circle with tomato sauce. 

BEEF HASH. 

Chop the cold cooked meat very fine, use half as much meat 
as of cold boiled potatoes, also chopped. Put a little boiling 
water and butter into a saucepan ; when it boils again put in 
the meat and potatoes, well salted and peppered. Let it cook 
well, stirring occasionally, not enough to make a puree or 
mush of it. It is not done before there is a coating at the 
bottom of the pan from which the hash will free itself without 
sticking. The hash must not be at all watery, nor yet too 
dry, but so that it will stand quite firm on well trimmed and 
buttered slices of toast. Chicken, turkey, corn beef or veal 
hash may be made in the same manner. 

TO COOK LIVER. 

Fry in a saute pan some thin slices of breakfast bacon, and 
when done put them on a hot dish. Fry then thin slices of 
liver in the same fat, which have previously been thrown into 
boiling water, for only a moment, and then sprinkled with 
flour. When well done on both sides serve them and the 
bacon on the same dish, and garnish them with slices, of 
lemon. 

BOILED MUTTON. 

This should be quite fresh. Put it in well-salted boiling 
water, and keep it boiling until the meat is thoroughly done. 
The rule is to boil it a quarter of an hour for each pound of 
meat. Caper sauce should be served with this dish, either 
in a sauce-boat or poured over the mutton. Garnish with 
parsley. 



MEATS. 27 



BOILING OR STEWING. 

For boiling, stewing or braising, inferior pieces of meat may 
be used and made very good but remember, 1st : Be sure the 
water is boiling when you pour it over the meat. 2d : Stand 
it on the back part of the range where it will simmer. Never 
boil. Allow forty minutes for every pound of meat. Add 
salt when meat is half done. 

MUTTON CUTLETS. 

Trim them well, scraping the bones. Roll them in a little 
melted butter or oil, season, and broil them, or they are nice 
rolled in egg and bread-crumbs and fried. If broiled serve 
them round a bed of mashed potatoes, or with tomato sauce. 
They are very nice with almost any kind of vegetable, such 
as peas or string-beans, in the centre of the dish, with the 
cutlets in a circle around. 

HOW TO BROIL HAM. 

Slice the meat as thin as possible, then put it into a pan of 
cold water, set it on the stove, and let it come to a boil. Then 
have the griddle hot, and broil the ham, adding a little cayenne 
pepper. 

TO GLAZE A COLD HAM. 

After the ham is boiled and cold cover it with the well- 
beaten yolk of an egg. Sprinkle with cracker or grated stale 
bread, then cover again with sweet cream, and bake until 
brown. 

A QUICK WAY TO BROIL STEAK. 

Have a nice tenderloin steak, pound it until thin. Put it 
in a dry, hot skillet if you have no broiler. Have ready in a 
meat dish a heaping tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoon of 
salt, a good deal of pepper, and a little water. Set this in 
front of the stove. As the juice cooks out of the steak, pour 



28 MEATS. 

it in the dish, then turn it, and brown on the other side. 
Saturate the steak well with the gravy and serve very hot. 

GIBLET PIE WITH OYSTERS. 

Take the giblets of two full-grown chickens or a large 
turkey, stew them until nearly done, then cut them up in 
pieces an inch in size. Have ready a pan lined with rich 
paste, into which pour the giblets mixed with a quart of 
oysters. Put in also enough of the oyster liquor to make the 
pie very juicy. Add flour to thicken slightly, with butter, 
pepper and salt, and bake until the pastry is a light brown. 

VIRGINIA BRUNSWICK STEW. 

For a large family take three gallons water, to which add 
two chickens which have been cut up and one pound fat bacon, 
also cut very fine. As soon as the chickens are sufficiently 
cooked for the meat to leave the bones, take them out and 
extract all the bones. Return the meat to the water, then add 
half a gallon of Irish potatoes boiled and mashed, one and a 
half pints green corn cut off, one pint green butter-beans, one 
quart skinned tomatoes, and a good sized loaf of light bread. 
Season with black and red pepper, salt and butter. The 
bread must not be put in till the stew is nearly done. As 
soon as it begins to thicken it must be stirred constantly until 
it is done. If it should be too thick add more water. Much 
depends on the judgment of the person who makes it. When 
properly made no one is able to detect any of the ingredients. 
Squirrels are a very good substitute for chicken. 

ENGLISH MEAT PIE. 

Chop any kind of cold meat very fine. Season with the 
grated rind and juice of a lemon, a little nutmeg, red and 
black pepper, salt, a teaspoonful of dry mustard, a little onion 
and parsley. Two raw eggs with a little rich gravy or butter. 



MEATS. 29 

Grate bread-crumbs on top, covered with lumps of butter. 
Bake it and garnish it with hard-boiled eggs. 

FRIED CHICKEN, MARYLAND STYLE. 

Have the chickens killed the day before they are to be eaten 
and put on ice. Cut the chicken in seven pieces, have them 
wiped dry, then flour lightly, season high with pepper and salt. 
Have your lard boiling hot, then put the chicken in, turning 
carefully, let it soak well, then take it out, and put in a pan 
to keep hot. Then have some flour browned, and add to the 
gravy in the pan with a good cup full of cream or rich milk 
with some parsley chopped, let it thicken, and serve it in a gravy 
dish. Make Mush cakes, fry separately, serve on the dish with 

the chicken. 

A NICE HASH. 

A small piece of cold turkey, chicken or veal, two or three 
hard boiled eggs, two or three well boiled potatoes, a lump of 
butter the size of an egg, salt and pepper to taste; chop all 
very fine, and put it on the fire to heat thoroughly, but not to 
cook. The butter should be allowed to melt through the hash 
thoroughly, and then serve 'it very hot. A little sweet cream 
may be an improvement, but it is not necessary. It is better 
and more delicate with a greater quantity of eggs and potatoes 
than meat. It is very nice baked hash brown. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

Cut up the chickens, wash them, and let them remain in 
water half an hour in order to make them white. Drain them 
and put them in a saucepan with a pint of fresh water. Season 
them with pepper and salt, place them on the fire, and let them 
stew half an hour. Then take two tablespoonsful of flour and 
two ounces of butter, stir them together till quite smooth, and 
add this to the chickens with half a pint of cream. Boil till 
the chickens are tender. A little mace or onion parsley may 
be added if desired. 



30 MEATS. 



BROILED CHICKEN. 

Clean them nicely, cut them down the back, and break the 
breastbone with a rolling-pin. Wash and wipe them dry. 
Place them on a gridiron over bright coals ; cover them with 
a sheet of tin and turn them several times. When done they 
should be brown on both sides. Take them up, season with 
pepper and salt, and baste them with butter. Serve very hot. 

RECIPE FOR BAKED HAM. 

Take a new ham, parboil it until it is tender enough to be 
skinned easily. Then stick cloves all over the top about an 
inch apart. Mix a pint of wine and quarter pound of sugar, 
and baste the ham repeatedly with it while it is baking. Do 
not pour it all over at once, but a few spoonsful at a time. 
Bake two or three hours. When cold it is excellent for 
broiling. 

POMPEY'S HEAD. 

Three pounds of uncooked round of beef minced up, some 
very fat ham, and a large slice of bread; season with onions, 
thyme, parsley, ground cloves, salt and pepper, and one egg ; 
mix all well and form into a large ball bound around with 
strips of cloth to keep it in shape. These can be removed 
before dishing the beef. Put in an oven with a little water 
and slices of bacon, or a spoonful of lard ; cook slowly, baste 
often. When taken up make the gravy of browned flour. 
Grate on bread-crumbs before taking off the fire. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

One head and liver. Boil liver until done and head until 
the bones can be pulled out. Cut it in pieces no larger than 
walnuts, chop two white onions and mix it with half a tea- 
spoonful of powdered nutmeg or mace; same of allspice, one 
heaping tablespoonful black pepper, salt to taste, quarter pound 



MEATS. 31 

butter, one wineglass of sherry wine, the same of brandy. 
Mix all and put it in a dish. Grate bread-crumbs on top and 
spread some of the butter over to brown it. Bake. 

TENDERLOIN OF BEEF. 

To serve tenderloin as directed below, the whole piece must 
be extracted before the hind quarter of the animal is cut out. 
This must be particularly noted, because not commonly prac- 
tised, the tenderloin being usually left attached to the roasting 
pieces in order to furnish a tidbit for a few. Wash the piece 
well, put it in an oven, add about a pint of water, and chop 
up a good handful of the following vegetables, as an ingre- 
dient of the dish, viz. : Irish potatoes, carrots, turnips, and a 
large bunch of celery. They must be washed, peeled and 
chopped up raw, then added to the meat ; blended with the 
juice they form and flavor the gravy. Let the whole slowly 
simmer, and when nearly done add one teaspoonful of pounded 
allspice. To give richness to the gravy, put in one table- 
spoonful of butter. If the gravy should look too greasy skim 
off some of the melted suet. Boil also a lean piece of beef, 
which when perfectly done, chop fine, flavoring with a small 
quantity of onion, besides pepper and salt to the taste. Make 
into small balls, wet them on the outside with egg, roll in 
grated cracker or fine bread-crumbs. Fry these balls a light 
brown. When serving the dish put them around the tender- 
loin, and pour over the whole the rich gravy. This is a dish 
fit for an epicure. 

BEEF STEW (with Tomatoes). 

Slice three pounds lean beef and seven moderate sized 
tomatoes with one onion. Cut up the tomatoes very small, 
and chop the onion fine. Stew slowly, add salt, a few 
cloves, and just before it is done, a little butter and half 
a gill of catsup.

HOW TO BOIL A HAM. 

It is always best to wash a ham the evening before the day 
it is to be cooked, and let it soak in water all night. In the 
morning cover it well with water, and keep it boiling until 
ready to dish up dinner. If the bone on the under side comes 
out easily the ham is done. You may remove the outside 
skin or not. The prettiest way of serving a ham is to take 
off the skin after it is thoroughly boiled, to grate bread-crumbs 
thickly over the top, and brush the whole over with the yolks 
of eggs. Then put it into an oven, and let it brown thor- 
oughly. If while boiling it is found necessary to add more 
water to the ham, be sure that the water is boiling, for cold 
water will inevitably make the meat tough. 

BAKED CALF'S HEAD. 

Boil the head after being well cleaned until all the bones 
may be easily drawn out. Lay the pieces of meat on a dish 
and cut them into small pieces. Season with cayenne pepper, 
mace, cloves, nutmeg, parsley, onions, sweet marjoram and a 
little thyme, a small bit of each chopped up fine ; salt to taste. 
Lay some lumps of butter over it, and as much butter as will 
cover it. Then put it in the oven, and when baked tender 
take the meat out, adding half a pint of Madeira wine, a 
teacup of walnut catsup, and three or four eggs beaten up 
with butter to the gravy, which must then be thickened over 
the fire. Keep stirring it while thickening, and then pour it 
over the meat, which is now ready to be served. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE. 

Take two chickens, cut them up, and lay them in a skillet 
with two thin slices of ham, two small eschalots, and a few 
blades of mace. Then season the fowls with pepper and salt. 
Add a little water. When about half done add half a pint 



MEATS. 33 

of cream and a lump of butter the size of a walnut rolled in 
flour. Keep the fricassee constantly stirring till done. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Cut the veal an inch thick. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
and rub the meat with it. Throw over it grated bread, 
parsley, thyme, grated nutmeg, and pepper and salt. Stir 
into the gravy, after the cutlets are taken out, butter and 
pepper. Fry brown and well. Lemon peel improves them. 

TO TRIM A FILLET OF BEEF. 

All the skin and fat must be removed from the top of the 
fillet, from one end to the other ; then the rib bones are dis- 
engaged. The fat adhering to the side opposite the fibs is 
only partially removed. Then the sinewy skin covering the 
upper meat of the fillet must be removed in strips, proceeding 
by slipping the blade of the knife between the skin and the 
meat. This is a very simple process, yet it requires great 
precision. The upper part of a trimmed fillet must be smooth, 
not furrowed by hollows occasioned by wrong movements of 
the knife. The skin being removed, both extremities of the 
fillet are rounded. The fat inside of the rib is the only por- 
tion allowed to adhere to the meat. The larding of the meat 
is applied to its upper surface. 

TO COOK A FILLET OF BEEF. 

After it is trimmed and larded put it into a small baking 
pan, in the bottom of which are some chopped pieces of 
pork and beef suet. Sprinkle some salt and pepper over 
it, and put a large ladleful of hot stock in the bottom 
of the pan, or it may be simply basted with boiling water. 
The oven should be very hot, and half an hour before 
dinner put the beef in. Baste it often, supplying a little 
hot stock if necessary.

BEEFSTEAK WITH MUSHROOMS. 

Take one quart of fresh mushrooms, skin and wash them 
carefully through several waters, and put them in a stew-pan 
with no more water than that which adheres to them. Season 
with salt and pepper, and dredge through them a dessert- 
spoonful of flour, stirring very lightly ; when half done add 
two ounces of fresh butter. Broil one or more steaks, which 
when done place on a well-heated dish and season with salt 
and pepper, basting them with butter. Then pour the mush- 
rooms over, and serve hot. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

Wash and boil a nice head until it is tender. Take out the 
brains as soon as it is washed and the chops divided from the 
skull. Have ready one quart beef gravy ; add spices and 
walnut catsup to your taste. Cut the head up, put it in the 
gravy and stew it a short time. Add two tablespoonsful of 
butter rubbed in brown flour. Add a little wine last of all. 
Bake in a dish and garnish with pastry cakes and hard-boiled 
eggs. Put all on a dish with forcemeat balls and brain cakes. 

BEEF A LA MODE. 

\ 

Take the bone from a round of beef, and fill the space with 
a forcemeat made of the crumbs of a stale loaf, four ounces 
of marrow, two heads of garlic chopped with thyme and 
parsley, some nutmeg, cloves, pepper and salt, mix it to a 
paste with the yolks of four eggs beaten, stuff the lean part 
of the round with it, and make balls of the remainder. Sew 
a strip of linen over it strong and wide enough to keep it 
round and compact. Put it in a vessel just large enough to 
hold it, add one pint red wine, cover it with sheets of tin or 
iron, set it in a brick oven properly heated and bake it three 
hours. When done skim the fat from the gravy, thicken it 
with brown flour, add some mushroom and walnut catsup and 



MEATS. 35 

serve it up garnished with fried forcemeat balls. It is good 
eaten cold with salad, or with vegetables around it in the gravy. 

BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

Cut up some nice steaks, and stew them till done ; put a 
puff paste in the dish, lay in the steaks with a few slices of 
boiled ham. Season the gravy very high, pour it in the dish, 
put on the lid of paste, and bake it. 

TO GRILL A CALF'S HEAD. 

Clean and divide it, take out the brains and tongue, boil it 
tender, take the eyes out whole, and cut the flesh from the 
skull in small pieces. Take some of the water in which it 
was boiled, for gravy, put to it salt, cayenne pepper, a grated 
nutmeg, with a spoonful of lemon pickle ; stew it till it is well 
flavored, take the jowl or chop, remove the bones, and cover 
it with bread-crumbs, chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and 
set it in an oven to brown. Thicken the gravy with the yolks 
of two eggs, and a spoonful of butter rubbed into two of flour. 
Stew the head in it a few minutes, put it in the dish, and lay 
the grilled chop on it. Garnish it with brain cakes and broiled 
sweetbreads. 

CALF'S HEART. 

Take the heart and liver from the haslet, and cut off the 
windpipe ; boil the lights very tender, and cut them in small 
pieces. Take as much of the water they were boiled in as 
will be sufficient for gravy, add to it a large spoonful of white 
wine, one of lemon pickle, some grated nutmeg, pepper and 
salt, with a large spoonful of butter mixed with one of white 
flour. Let it boil a few minutes, put in the minced lights, 
and set it by till the heart and liver are ready. Cut the 
ventricle out of the heart, wash it well, and lard it all over 
with narrow strips of middling. Fill the cavity with good 
forcemeat, and put it in a pan on the broad end, that the 



36 MEATS. 

stuffing may not come out. Bake it a nice brown. Slice the 
liver an inch thick, broil it, set the heart upright in the middle 
of the dish, make the minced lights hot, pour the mince around 
it, lay the broiled liver on, and garnish with bunches of fried 
parsley. It should be served up extremely hot. This is a 

very nice dish. 

HARICOT OF MUTTON. 

Take the nicest part of the rack, divide it into chops, with 
one bone in each, beat them flat, sprinkle salt and pepper on 
them and broil them nicely. Make a rich gravy out of the 
inferior parts, season it well with pepper, a little spice, and 
any kind of catsup you like. When sufficiently done strain 
it, and thicken it with butter and brown flour; have some 
carrots and turnips cut into small dice and boiled till tender, 
put them in the gravy, lay the chops in and stew them fifteen 
minutes. Serve them up garnished with green pickle. 

TO MAKE SHOAT CUTLETS. 

Take the skin from the hind quarter, and cut it in pieces, 
prepare them the same as veal cutlets ; make a little nice 
gravy with the skin and the scraps of meat left, thicken it 
with butter and brown flour, and season it as you like. 

BROILED SQUIRRELS. 

Clean and soak them to draw out the blood. Wipe them 
dry and broil them over a hot, clear fire, turning often. When 
done, lay them in a hot dish, and cover with melted butter, 
seasoned with pepper and salt. Use at least a tablespoonful 
for each squirrel, and let it lie five minutes between two hot 
dishes, before serving. 

TO COOK RABBIT FOR BREAKFAST. 

Take a nice fat rabbit, cut it open and sprinkle it with a 
little salt and pepper and some flour. Have ready some lard, 
boiling hot, and put the rabbit in it. Fry till it is a nice 



MEATS. 37 

brown. Then take a spoonful of brown flour and add a little 
hot water. Mix the flour with a small lump of butter and 
stir it in the gravy. Season very high. Place the rabbit on 
the dish, pour the gravy over it, and serve very hot. Cream 
instead of water for the gravy is better. 

INDIAN CURRY. 

Cut up an onion very fine and brown it in a tablespoon ful 
of lard or butter; add a tablespoon ful of curry powder made 
into a paste, put it on the fire and stir it until thoroughly 
cooked, being careful not to scorch it. Then add the meat 
chicken, rabbit or mutton, as you prefer and stir in a cupful 
of stock of boiling water ; then cover it with stock or boiling 
water, and let it boil slowly until the meat is tender. To 
thicken the gravy add three boiled and mashed potatoes. If 
you wish it very hot add a little Worcestershire sauce. Serve 
with rice boiled dry all around the dish. 

HOW TO COOK WILD DUCKS. 

After cleaning and preparing the ducks place them in a 
very hot oven, and cook them eighteen or twenty minutes. 
Wild ducks should never be stuffed. To retain the wild juicy 
flavor which is so delightful they should always be underdone. 
In order to test when they are done (which of course depends 
upon the size of the duck and the heat of the oven), stick a 
fork into them, and if the red juice runs out they must be 
cooked a little longer. Serve with gravy from the ducks. No 
flour is used with them at all. Serve with celery, fried hom- 
iny, or currant jelly. 

SAUSAGE. 

Twenty-five pounds of meat, seven pounds of fat,- one-half 
pound of salt, eighteen tablespoonsful of sage, seven of black 
pepper, six of fresh thyme, or dried if you can't get fresh, one 
teaspoon ful of red pepper.

one-quarter pound black pepper, tablespoonful of cayenne 
pepper. This quantity is for one thousand pounds of meat. 
Rub it well on the hams, let them lie with skins down, and 
put an extra handful of the mixture on the top of each ham ; 
at the end of three weeks rub this well into the hams. If the 
weather is cold, let them remain this way for six weeks ; if 
mild, for five weeks, at the end of which time hang up with 
tar rope, and smoke every day for four weeks with hickory, and 
cedar wood mixed. Cure breakfast bacon and shoulders the 
same way. 

RATCLIFFE MANOR SAUSAGE.

Have the cutlets cut thin, then season with salt and pepper ; 
beat up two eggs for a good-sized dish, and dip the cutlets in 
the egg; then roll in stale bread-crumbs or grated cracker, 
and have your lard boiling hot ; put the cutlets in the lard 
and fry brown. Of course they must be turned. Then re- 
move the cutlets, and add half pint of cream or rich milk, 
with a large tablespoonful of brown flour, to the gravy, and 
season with parsley, thyme and nutmegs. Let the gravy just 
come to the boiling point. If you have no cream or milk, 
use water with a good-sized lump of butter. 

BREADED CHOPS. 

Broil French chops ten minutes, turn them very often, take 
them. from the broiler, baste with melted butter, season with

quillings over the end of the bones, and arrange the chops 
nicely in the sauce. Garnish with parsley, and serve very 

hot.

with a sharp knife, very carefully, the sinews and fat that are 
inside. Now cut the kidneys in small pieces, put in a pan, 
cover with cold water, stand on a moderate fire and bring 
almost to a boiling point. Drain this water off, cover with 
fresh cold water and heat again ; do this three times. Do not 
let it boil, or the kidney will be tough and hard. Put a 
tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan, stir until brown ; add 
one tablespoonful of flour, one-half pint of boiling water or 
stock ; stir constantly until it boils. Now add one table- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful of mush-

veal with a damp cloth, make long gashes through the ribs, and 
fill with the stuffing. Place it in a baking pan, and roast the 
same as the loin. 

VEAL CROQUETTES. 

Veal croquettes are made the same as chicken croquettes 
using chopped veal, leaving out the sweetbreads (calf's brains 
added in their place), and if carefully made, good judges can 
scarcely discover the difference.

every ten minutes, and baked fifteen minutes to every pound 
in a very hot oven. Mint sauce, green peas, and asparagus 
tips, should be served with spring lamb. 

BAKED HASH. 

One quart cold cooked chopped beef, two eggs, one pint 
chopped uncooked potatoes, salt and pepper. Put the chopped 
potatoes in a pan with one pint of water. Let them stew five 
minutes, then add the meat and enough water to make the moist-

to brown ; dredge in the flour, stir again ; then add the milk 
and a little pepper, stir again until it boils, then serve. 

CURRY OF MUTTON. 

One pint finely-chopped mutton, one-half cupful of rice, one 
tablespoonful Curry Powder, two quarts boiling water, one 
tablespoonful of butter, one of flour, salt to taste. Wash the 
rice, put it in boiling water ; let it boil thirty-five minutes, 
drain in a cullender. Put the butter in a frying pan ; when 
melted, add the flour, and stir until smooth ; add one-half 
pint boiling water ; let it boil up once, then add meat curry 
and salt. Stir ten minutes. Now heap it in the centre of a 
meat dish and put the rice around. Brush all over with beaten 
egg and place in the oven to brown. 

LIVER WITH BROWN SAUCE. 

One pound calf's liver, two slices of bacon, one tablespoon- 
ful of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful of mushroom 
catsup, one tablespoonful of flour, one-half pint boiling stock 
or water. Cut the liver in slices, cover with boiling water, 
let it stand five minutes to draw the blood. Take it out and

bread crumbs ; fry in boiling fat. Serve with cream sauce. 



SOUPS. 



MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

Parboil a calf's head, scrape the hair off, split it open and 
take out the brains, then put the head back in the pot, with 
one and a half gallons of water; add liver and haslet, a bunch 
of thyme, and a large slice of middling ; let it boil till the 
bones come out ; take these out, and season the soup to taste. 
Put in one tablespoonful of allspice, a good pinch of cloves, 
the same of mace, four tablespoonsful of pounded pepper and 
salt. Thicken it. Slice the head and liver, put it all back

each plateful ; cut in small pieces. 

OKRA SOUP. 

Take two dozen okra pods. When they are tender slice 
them and put on to boil five hours before dinner in one and a 
half gallons of water. Then add four sliced onions, one and

GUMBO SOUP. 

Take any kind of cold meat cold roast beef is the best 
and cut it in small pieces. Put these and the bones into a 
pot, with as much water as you will need, early in the day. 

45 



46 SOUPS. 

Let it boil slowly, keeping it well skimmed. In the mean- 
time take, of young corn, gumbo, and tomatoes, equal parts, 
and cut them fine. A little onion, just enough to taste, also 
chopped celery and salt to taste. Put these in the pot with 
the meat, and let all boil very slowly. Have ready some 
brown flour, brown sugar, a little wine or vinegar, a large 
lump of butter seasoned with pepper, mustard and spice. 
Make these into a paste. Remove the bones from the pot 
before thickening with the paste. 

RATCLIFFE CRAB SOUP. No. i. 

One quart of picked crab, discarding all fat. Take one 
pint of water, add four pieces of mace, one onion cut in half, 
so it can be taken out (not served with the soup), three blades 
of parsley, a little red pepper and salt. When it boils, add 
the crab, with one large iron spoonful of butter mixed with 
two tablespoonsful of flour. Stir in the crab, then add one 
quart of cream or rich milk. Let it come to a good boil ; 
serve hot. Milk must be very fresh and sweet. 

POTATO SOUP. 

Take one quart of milk, and add as much cold-boiled 
potatoes mashed through a cullender as will make it the con- 
sistency of a thick custard ; a large iron spoonful of butter, 
pepper and salt to taste. If preferred, a little chopped parsley 
gives a nice flavor. Very simple, but very nice. 

BEAN SOUP. 

Take any quantity of black beans you wish ; soak them 
over night, then boil them until thoroughly done. Press 
them through a cullender, retaining the flour only; add 
thyme, a little butter, pepper, salt, parsley and sweet mar- 
joram. Let it boil well. A short time before serving add 
forcemeat balls, a sliced lemon, hard-boiled eggs and wine to 



SOUPS. 47 

taste. If you desire, add half a pound of pork, the same of 
beef, and one or two onions. The proportions are, one pint 
of beans to one gallon of water. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

Take four large bunches of asparagus, scrape them nicely, 
cut off one inch of the tops, lay them in water, chop up the 
stalks and put them on the fire with a piece of bacon and a 
large onion cut up, with pepper and salt. Add two quarts of 
water, boil until the stalks are quite soft, press them through 
a sieve, strain the water, and put it into the pot. Cut up a 
chicken with the tops of the asparagus, and boil all until 
done. Thicken it with flour, butter and milk. 

RATCLIFFE ASPARAGUS SOUP. No. i. 

Wash and cut up in small pieces one large bunch of aspar- 
agus and one onion. Put on the fire with three pints of 
water, one pound of any kind of white meat, chicken pre- 
ferred (veal very good), pepper and salt. Just before serving, 
add one large spoonful of butter, creamed in same quantity of 
flour, and one quart of rich milk with the cream in it. Boil 
up quickly. Strain and serve hot. 

A DELICIOUS VEGETABLE SOUP. 

What remains of a roast will serve very well for a basis if 
you have no piece of fresh uncooked meat. Let the vessel in 
which the soup is to be made be provided with a close cover, 
and allow yourself plenty of time, so that the soup need only 
simmer for five or six hours, but never boil hard. As the 
water evaporates, add more, but always let it be boiling after 
the first, which should be poured cold over the meat. Add 
vegetables as you like for instance a quart of ripe tomatoes 
scalded and peeled, but if you have not so many, a few will 
make their impression ; a large handful of green corn, cut 



48 SOUPS. 

from the cob ; another of young, tender okra, and another of 
Irish potatoes, peeled and cut small ; lastly a handful of 
small lima beans. Season cautiously with salt and pepper, 
remembering that more can easily be added at table. In this 
kind of soup a pod of red pepper, not broken, is preferable to 
black pepper. Stir the soup frequently, lest the vegetables 
stick to the bottom and burn. Skim carefully and dish 
up hot. In the far South, where this soup is made to 
perfection, they let the vegetables cook so thoroughly as to 
form an indistinguishable mass, and strain it, so that the 
flavor is left without the substance. 

CORN SOUP. 

To each quart of young corn, cut from the cob, allow three 
pints of water. Boil until the grains are tender. Take two 
ounces of sweet butter mixed smooth with one tablespoonful 
of flour. Stir the butter into the soup and let it boil ten or 
fifteen minutes longer. Just before taking out of the pot, 
beat up an egg and stir it in with pepper and salt to taste. 

OKRA SOUP. 

To one gallon of water, cut up two double handsful of okra. 
Half an hour afterwards add one handful of lima beans, pieces 
of tender squashes, some fresh meat or a fowl boiled till well 
done. One hour before you take it up, put in five large toma- 
toes, or a pint of small ones, peeled and sliced, and when 
almost done put in a lump of butter rolled in flour. Season 
with salt and pepper. Do not let it be too thick. Put it on 
early and let it simmer only. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Take seven or eight medium-sized tomatoes, three pints of 
broth, four or five stalks of parsley, two of thyme, salt, pepper, 
a teaspoonful of peppercorns, a bay leaf, two onions, three 



SOUPS. 49 

cloves, three or four cloves of garlic, quarter of a pound of 
rice, one tablespoonful of butter, one ounce of sugar and three 
slices of bread. Put the tomatoes in boiling water for a few 
seconds, then take them off, drop them into cold water, and 
skin them. Then put them in a saucepan and set them on a 
moderate fire, with the broth, parsley, salt and pepper, and the 
following spices tied in a linen bag : thyme, peppercorns, bay 
leaf, onions and cloves. When cooked, the whole is turned 
into a cullender (except the spices in the bag) and forced 
through with a potato-masher, except the tomato seeds ; then 
the strained juice and pulp are mixed with the rice; after it 
has been boiled the butter and sugar are added. The whole is 
simmered for about half an hour and turned into a soup-dish. 
While it is simmering the slices of bread are cut into dice and 
fried with a little butter and put into the soup tureen before 
pouring the mixture therein. Cover it for two minutes and 
serve. Excellent. 

VEAL SOUP. 

Put a knuckle of veal into three quarts of cold water, with 
a small quantity of salt, and one small tablespoonful of un- 
cooked rice. Boil slowly, hardly above simmering, four hours, 
when the liquor should be reduced to half the quantity ; then 
remove from the fire. Into the tureen put the yolk of one 
egg, and stir into it a teacupful of cream, or in hot weather 
new milk. Add a piece of butter the size of a hickory nut ; 
on this strain the soup boiling hot, stirring all the time. Just 
at the last beat it well for a minute. 

DRIED PEA SOUP. 

f Take one quart split peas, put them in three quarts of very 
soft water, with three onions chopped, and a little pepper, and 
salt ; boil them two hours. Mash them well, and pass them 
through a sieve. Return the liquor to the pot, thicken it with 
a large piece of butter mixed with a tablespoonful of flour; 
put in some slices of nice salt pork, and a large teaspoon of 
4 



50 SOUPS. 

celery seed pounded. Boil it until the pork is done, and serve 
it up. Have some toasted bread cut into dice and fried in 
butter, and put these in the tureen ; then pour the soup over. 

CATFISH SOUP. 

Take two large or four small catfish that have been caught 
in deep water, cut off the heads, and skin and clean the bodies. 
Cut each in three parts, and put them in a pot with one pound 
lean bacon, one large onion cut up, a handful of parsley chopped 
small, some pepper and salt ; pour in a sufficient quantity of 
water, and stew them till the fish are quite tender, but not 
broken. Beat the yolks of four fresh eggs, add to them a 
large spoonful of butter, two of flour, and half a pint of rich 
milk. Make all these warm and thicken the soup ; take out 
the bacon, and put some of the fish in the tureen ; pour in the 
soup, and serve it up. 

PLAIN OYSTER SOUP. 

Strain the oysters. Take the liquor if it is perfectly fresh : 
if not, throw it away and use one pint of water instead. Add 
a small onion, three blades of mace, some celery chopped fine, 
pepper and salt. Celery salt is the best to use if you have it. 
Let it come to a boil ; then add the oysters. When they have 
come just to a boil, add as much cream and milk as will fill 
the tureen. Thicken it with flour and butter rubbed together, 
about two spoonsful of flour and three ounces of butter to a 
tureen full, and three pints large oysters. 

CRAB SOUP. 

Take one pint water, add a little onion, three or four blades 
of mace, a little parsley, cayenne pepper and salt. Let them 
come to a boil. Then add one quart picked crabs, one quart 
rich milk and cream half and half, one-quarter pound butter 
rubbed into a tablespoonful flour. Stir all into the crab. Let 
it come to a good boil and send it hot to the table. 



SOUPS. 51 



STOCK, OR POT AU FEU. 

In ordinary circumstances beef alone, with some vegetables, 
will make a good broth or stock, in the proportions of two 
and a half pints of cold clear water to every pound of bones 
and meat ; the bones and meat should be of about equal 
weight. It makes the soup more delicate to add chicken or 
veal. Good soup can be made also by using the trimmings 
of fresh meat, bits of cold cooked beef, or the bones of any 
meat or fowl. In the choice of vegetables, onions (first fried 
or saute and a clove stuck in), parsley and carrots are used, 
as these will keep. Turnips, parsley and celery should be 
employed more sparingly. The soup bunch at market is gen- 
erally a very good distribution of vegetables. Nothing is 
more simple than the process of making stock or broth. 
Remember not to let it boil for the first half hour ; then it 
should simmer slowly and steadily for four or five hours. 
Skim frequently, as the scum, if allowed to remain, gives an 
unpleasant flavor to the soup. Use salt sparingly, putting in 
a little at first, and seasoning at the last moment. Many a 
good soup is spoiled by an injudicious use of seasoning. Some 
add a few drops of lemon juice to a broth. If wine or catsup 
is added, it should only be at the last moment. Always strain 
the soup ; small scraps of meat or sediment look slovenly in 
a soup. About fifteen minutes before dinner each day, you 
can add what vegetables you like, to vary the soup. 

A "NO. i" OYSTER SOUP. 

To make a tureen of rich oyster soup take three pints of 
gpod oysters and wash them through two waters, then put 
them into a stewpan with a pint of water and one small onion 
(not cut small), six blades of mace, two stalks of celery cut 
fine. Let it come to a boil, then strain out the oysters. Have 
ready one quart roast oysters, quarter pound fresh butter, two 
tablespoonsful of flour rubbed together very smooth. Then 



52 SOUPS. 

add three pints of rich cream and milk half and half. (Morn- 
ing's milk must be used as older milk will curdle.) Then let 
it come to a good boil, season with a little cayenne pepper and 
salt, place the roast oysters in the tureen very hot and pour the 
soup over them. This is the best oyster soup made. 

TURTLE BEAN SOUP. 

Soak one quart of beans over night, then drain off the water. 
Add fresh water and let them boil up once; drain them through 
a cullender. Then put them into more water with a knuckle 
of veal, cold beef or mutton (about two pounds of meat). 
Boil it five hours, then strain the whole through a sieve, 
mashing the beans so that all but the skins will go through. 
Put it on again, let it boil, flavor with salt and pepper. Cut 
a lemon into slices and boil two eggs hard. Chop them up 
and put them into the tureen with a cup of wine (if you 
desire it), and then pour in the soup. 

CANNED TOMATO SOUP. 

Make a strong soup seasoned with an onion, a little parsley, 
pepper and salt and half a can of tomatoes. Let them boil in 
the soup for an hour, then strain it and thicken with a little 
flour and butter. For a large family use a whole can of 
tomatoes and more seasoning. 

CLEAR SOUP. 

Take one large beef shank, split the bones, and slightly 
roast the meat. To this put six quarts of water, one can 
tomatoes, one bunch celery chopped fine, two or three blades 
of mace and a bunch of soup herbs. Boil all together for 
six or eight hours. Then strain it through a cullender and 
set it aside until next day. After the soup becomes cold be 
careful to remove all grease. Then set it on the stove until 
it becomes warm, when clear it with the whites of three eggs 
well beaten. Before sending to table add a small quantity of 



SOUPS. 53 



red pepper. If it is of too light a color stir in a spoonful of 
burnt sugar, one teaspoonful of Tournades or Kitchen Bouquet. 



SUET DUMPLINGS. . 

One pound flour, half a pound chopped suet, one teaspoonful 
salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Moisten with water 
until it is a stiff paste. They may be made into balls and are 
used in savory pies, hash stews or soups. 

SUET DUMPLINGS. 

One quart flour, one quart suet, a little salt. Mix with one 
pint of milk. Roll into balls and drop them in boiling water. 
They float on top when they are done. 

TOMATO BISQUE. 

One can of tomatoes. Let them come to a boil, pass through 
a cullender, then through a fine strainer. Put back in the pot, 
add a small teaspoon of bread soda to the tomatoes, stir in one 
tablespoonful of corn starch or cracker powdered very fine, 
moistened to a paste with a little water, one quart of rich new 
milk. Let come to a boil, then stir into the tomatoes. Add 
one teaspoonful of sugar and salt. 

BOUILLON NO. i. 

Three pounds of lean beef, two pounds of liver, one gallon 
cold water. Put on with one can of tomatoes, one pod of red 
pepper, two carrots, two small turnips, bunch of celery, two 
onions. All of the vegetables, but tomatoes, to be fried brown. 
Let it boil well for ten minutes, then put on the back of stove 
to simmer for five hours. Skim constantly ; strain through a 
tin strainer. Set in a cool place until the grease rises, then 
skim well and strain through a bag. Put back on the fire 
with the whites of two eggs well beaten (also shells), two 



54 SOUPS. 

tablespoonsful of browned sugar. Season with Sherry wine 
and nutmeg. Let boil slowly about twenty-five minutes, strain 
again through a clean bag. It is then ready for use. One 
teaspoonful of Tournades or Kitchen Bouquet to color it. 

VEAL STOCK. 

Two knuckles of veal, five quarts of cold water, one table- 
spoonful of salt, one onion, one carrot, one bay leaf, one turnip, 
stalk of celery, sprig of parsley, four cloves, one blade of niace. 
Wipe the knuckles with a damp towel and have the bones 
cracked. Put them into a soup kettle with cold water and 
salt. Place on a moderate fire and bring slowly to a boil ; 
skim. Now simmer for four hours. Clean the vegetables, 
and add them, and all the ingredients, to the soup, and simmer 
one hour longer. Strain and it is ready for use. 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

Three roots of celery, one quart of milk, one tablespoonful 
of butter, two tablespoonsful of flour, one pint of water, salt 
and pepper to taste, one small onion. Wash celery and cut in 
small pieces. Cover it with water and boil thirty minutes ; 
then press it through a cullender. Put the milk on to boil in 
a farina boiler ; add to it the water and celery that have been 
pressed through the cullender, also the onion. Rub the butter 
and flour together and stir into boiling soup, and stir constantly 
until it thickens. Add salt and pepper. 

CORN SOUP. 

One pint of grated corn, three pints of boiling water or 
veal stock, one pint hot milk, three tablespoonsful of butter, 
two of flour, yolks of two eggs. Put the cobs from which 
you have removed the corn in the water or stock and boil 
slowly half an hour. Remove them and put in the corn and 
boil till very soft, then press it through a sieve. Season and 
let simmer while you rub the butter and flour together, add 



SOUPS. 55 

these to soup and stir until it thickens. Now add boiling milk, 
cook one minute, add eggs well beaten and serve immediately. 

PEA SOUP. 

Shell one-half peck of green peas, wash pods and put in 
soup kettle with plenty of cold water, boil until tender, drain 
and throw away pods. Put the peas into this water and boil 
them three-quarters of an hour. Take out one cup of peas 
and wash rest through a sieve, and put back into soup kettle. 
(The soup should now measure about one pint.) Add three 
pints of rich milk and the cup of peas, let it come to a boil. 
Rub one-quarter pound of butter and two tablespoonsful of 
flour to a smooth paste and stir into soup. Add chopped 
parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. 

CARAMEL COLORING FOR SOUP. 

Melt half a pound of brown sugar with one teaspoonful of 
water. Stir steadily over the five until brown. Add slowly 
one cup of boiling water, one teaspoon of salt. Boil one 
minute, when cool, bottle and cork tightly. One table- 
spoonful will color clear soups. 



FISH AND SHELLFISH. 



TO FRY FISH. 

Perch, brook trout, catfish, and all small fish are best fried. 
They should be cleaned, washed well in cold water and imme- 
diately wiped dry inside and out with a clean towel, and then 
sprinkled with salt. Use oil if convenient, as it is better than 
drippings or lard. Never use butter as it is apt to burn. See 
that the oil or lard is boiling hot before putting in the fish. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

This is the very best way of cooking shad. The plank 
should be three inches thick, two feet long, and one-half wide, 
and of well seasoned hickory or oak. Take a fine shad just 
from the water, scale, split it down the back, clean it, wash 
well and at once wipe dry. Dredge it with salt and pepper. 
Place the plank before a clear fire to get very hot. Then 
spread the shad open and nail it skin side next to the hot 
plank, with four large headed tacks. Put it before the fire 
with large end down, in a few minutes turn the board so that 
the other end will be down. To tell when it is done, pierce 
with a fork ; if the flesh is flaky, it is done. Slide the shad 
on a hot dish, spread with butter and serve at once. White 
fish caught in the lakes can be cooked in the same manner. 

SHAD ROE CROQUETTES. 

Two shad roes, one-half pint cream, yolks of two eggs, one- 
quarter of a grated nutmeg, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonsful of flour, one of 

57 



58 FISH AND SHELLFISH. 

chopped parsley, salt and black and red pepper. Wash the 
roes, put in a saucepan of boiling water ; add teaspoonful of 
salt. Cover and simmer slowly fifteen minutes ; then take 
out, remove skin and mash them. Put cream to boil. Rub 
butter and flour together, add them to boiling cream and 
stir until very thick. Add yolks, take from fire and 
add other ingredients; mix well, turn out on a dish to 
cool. When cold, form into croquettes; dip in beaten egg, 
then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling oil or lard. 
Serve with sauce Hollandaise. 

BROILED SHAD. 

Scale, wash and score the shad, then mix together one 
tablespoonful of salt and one of sugar. Rub this over the 
fish, and let it remain for two hours. Then wash it again, 
dry it on a towel, and season with cayenne pepper and salt. 
Heat the gridiron and butter the bars ; broil it gradually, 
and when one side is well browned turn it. When it is done 
place it on a dish, baste it with butter, and serve hot. The 
roe of shad is very nice. Wash it carefully, then parboil it 
in salt water. When done season with salt and cayenne 
pepper, dredge with flour, and fry in fresh lard till fine brown 
both sides. Garnish dish with slices of lemon. 

BAKED SHAD. 

Clean, score and wash the shad ; then season well with salt 
and cayenne pepper. Put it in a pan and make a stuffing of 
stale bread, a little butter, salt and pepper, and place it inside 
the fish. Grate bread-crumbs and put on the outside also. 
Bake in a quick oven. When well done and brown put it on 
a dish and add the butter in the pan, and if preferred a little 
tomato catsup or Worcestershire sauce. Garnish the dish with 
parsley and slices of lemon. 



FISH AND SHELLFISH. 59 



BOILED ROCK. 

Scale, empty and clean the inside thoroughly. Take out 
the gills, and after washing it in cold water dredge over it a 
little flour. Put it into a fish-kettle of hot salted water, and 
if of medium size half an hour will boil it. All fish should 
be wrapped in a white cloth while boiling. When done and 
well drained fold it in a napkin, and place it on a dish gar- 
nished with lemon and parsley. Eat it with drawn butter, 
fish-sauce or catsup as preferred. All boiled fish are prepared 
and served in the same manner. 

BAKED STURGEON. 

The piece six inches from the tail is the best ; six or eight 
pounds makes a good dish. First immerse it in hot water 
for an hour or two to get rid of the oil. Cut off the gristle. 
Make incisions in it and fill with stuffing made of bread- 
crumbs, thyme, marjoram, pepper and salt, and a little butter. 
Put this dressing over the fish also. Place the sturgeon in 
a pan with half a pint of water, and bake it slowly nearly 
an hour. 

TO FRY PERCH. 

Clean the fish nicely, but do not take out the roes. Dry 
them on a cloth, sprinkle with salt, and dredge them with 
flour; lay them separately on a board. When one side is 
dry turn them, sprinkle salt, and dredge the other side. Be 
sure the lard boils when you put the fish in, and fry them 
with great care till they are a yellowish brown, then they are 
done. Serve with melted butter or anchovy sauce. 

CODFISH AND POTATO STEW. 

Soak, boil and pick the fish if salt as for fish-balls. If 
fresh boil and pick into bits. Add an equal quantity of 
mashed potatoes, and a large tablespoonful of butter and 



60 FISH AND SHELLFISH. 

milk, enough to make it soft. Put it into a skillet and add 
a very little boiling water, just enough to keep it from burn- 
ing. Turn and toss it constantly until it is smoking hot but 
not dry. Add pepper and parsley, and serve it up. 

FISH A LA CREME. 

Boil a rock or trout, or white fish, any good boiling fish, 
remove all bones, pick the meat carefully, mix with one pint 
of ,cream, one-quarter pound butter, two tablespoonsful of 
flour rubbed in the butter, little red pepper, salt and little 
parsley. Put it on, cook it until it is thick. Put it in a 
dish with some beaten crackers and cream. Bake twenty 
minutes. Serve all in one baking dish or individual dishes. 

HALIBUT STEAK. 

Wash and wipe the steaks dry. Beat up two or three eggs, 
and roll out some Boston or other hard crackers until they are 
very fine. Dip each steak into the beaten egg, then into the 
bread-crumbs (when you have salted the fish), and fry in hot 
fat, lard or nice drippings. Another nice way to cook them 
is to broil them upon a buttered gridiron over a clear fire, first 
seasoning with salt and pepper. When done, lay in a hot 
dish, butter well and cover closely. 

FRIED SHAD. 

Clean, wash and wipe a fine roe-shad. Split it open, cut 
each side into four pieces, leaving the head off, also the fins 
and tail. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dredge with 
flour. Have ready a frying-pan of boiling hot lard or drip- 
pings ; put in the fish and fry it brown, turning it over in 
five minutes to cook the other side. Fry the roe in the same 
way. Lay the fish in the centre of the dish and the roe 
around it. Garnish with lemon, parsley or watercresses. Eat 
with catsup. 



FISH AND SHELLFISH. 61 

CHOWDER. 

Take one pound salt pork, cut it into strips, and soak it in 
hot water five minutes. Put a layer of this in the bottom of 
a pot. Cut four pounds of cod or sea bass into pieces two 
inches square, and lay enough of these on the pork to cover 
it. Follow with a layer of chopped onions, summer savory 
and pepper, either black or cayenne. Then a layer of split 
Boston, Butter, or whole Cream crackers which have been 
soaked in water till moist through, but not ready to break. 
Above this put another layer of pork, and so on as before till 
all the materials are used. Let the upper layer Ipe buttered 
crackers well soaked. Pour in barely enough cold water to 
cover all. Cover the pot, stew gently for an hour, watching 
that the water does not sink below the upper layer; if it does, 
replenish cautiously from the boiling water in the tea-kettle. 
When the chowder is thoroughly done, take it out with a 
perforated skimmer and put it into a tureen. Thicken the 
gravy with one tablespoon of flour and one of butter. Boil 
it up and pour it over the chowder. Send sliced lemon, 
pickle and stewed tomatoes to the table with it, as some 
prefer these added to the chowder. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

Fry five or six slices of fat pork crisp, and chop to pieces. 
Sprinkle some of the-e in the bottom of a pot, and lay upon 
them a stratum of clams. Sprinkle with red or black pepper 
and salt, and scatter over all plenty of bits of butter. Now 
add a layer of chopped onions, then one of small crackers 
split and moistened in warm milk. On these pour a little 
of the hot fat left from the pork, and continue the layers as 
before. When the pot is nearly full cover with water and 
stew slowly (the pot closely covered) for three-quarters of an 
hour. Drain off all the liquor that flows freely, and when 
the chowder is in the tureen return the gravy to the pot. 



62 FISH AND SHELLFISH. 

Thicken with flour or pounded crackers. Add a glass of 
wine, some catsup and spiced sauce ; boil up and pour it over 
the chowder in the tureen. 

OYSTER FRITTERS. 

Drain off the liquor, and to one cupful add the same of 
milk, three eggs, a little salt and flour enough for a thin 
batter. Chop the oysters and stir them in the batter. Put 
in the frying-pan a few spoonsful of lard, or lard and butter 
mixed. When very hot drop the oyster-batter in by the 
tablespoonful. Try one spoonful to see that the lard is hot 
enough and the fritter the right size and consistency. When 
done to a light brown take them out quickly and send to table 
hot. Some fry the oyster whole enveloped in batter, having 
one in each fritter. In this case make the batter thicker than 
you do in using the chopped oysters. 

HOW TO BROIL OYSTERS. 

Put the oysters in a cullender and drain all the water from 
them, then put them in a napkin and wipe them dry. A 
moderate quantity of cayenne pepper may be put on them if 
desired. Salt gently, and dip each individual oyster in melted 
butter. Place them in a double gridiron, the bars of which 
should be greased to prevent them from sticking. Broil over 
a brisk fire, basting them with the melted butter while cook- 
ing. Serve on a hot dish. Pepper and salt to taste. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Separate the oysters from the liquor. Put the liquor in a 
stew-pan and add one pint water, a wineglass of cream, a 
lump of butter the size of an egg, pepper, salt and bread- 
crumbs to taste. Let them boil together, then add oysters 
and cook till thoroughly heated. 



FISH AND SHELLFISH. 63 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Take the oysters from the liquor, place some in a baking 
dish or pan, grate bread-crumbs highly seasoned with pepper 
and salt, and a few celery seed over them, with some bits of 
butter. Add another layer of oysters and the seasoning. 
Then pour over them a glass of wine and another layer of 
grated bread. Bake till hot through. 

OYSTER SAUCE FOR FOWLS. 

Plump the oysters for a moment or two over the fire. Then 
take them out and stir some flour and butter mixed into the 
liquor ; salt and pepper to taste. When it has boiled put in 
the oysters and add a glass of wine. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

Wash the oysters, then drain them. Put them in a kettle 
on the fire and cover them with cold water. Take off" the 
scum as it rises, and when they commence boiling throw in 
to every gallon of oysters one tablespoonful each of black- 
grain pepper and allspice, one-half the quantity of blade mace. 
When cold, add salt and vinegar to taste. 

PANNED OYSTERS. 

Take fifty large oysters, remove every particle of shell 
which may adhere to them ; put them into a cullender, and 
pour over a little water to rinse them. After letting them 
drain, put them into a stew-pan with quarter pound of butter, 
salt, black and red pepper to taste. Put them over a clear 
fire and stir while cooking. As soon as they commence to 
shrink, take them from the fire and send to table hot in a 
heated covered dish. 



64 FISH AND SHELLFISH. 

CRAB CAKES FOR BREAKFAST. (Very nice.) 

Take the crab after it is picked and season it high with red 
pepper and salt. Then add butter, and make them in round 
cakes, using a little flour to hold them together. Then dip 
them in egg and cracker beaten fine. Fry in hot butter or 
lard. 

BOILED CRABS. 

Put the crabs in a large kettle with about one quart hot 
salted water to a kettle full of crabs and let them steam 
twenty minutes. Put a cover over the kettle and on it a 
weight, in order that the steam may not escape. Then take 
them out, wipe them clean, and if the backs can be easily 
removed, they are done ; if not, steam them longer. Then 
take off the small claws, the backs, and all between the backs 
and the inner shell, and throw them away. The large claws 
may be cracked and sent to the table with the rest of the crab 
when picked. 

SOFT CRABS. 

Take off the small claws, wash, wipe and open the crabs, 
and after removing the spongy part and the sand-bag, season 
in and outside with salt and pepper. Then close them and 
fry in fresh butter a light brown on both sides. 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Drain one quart of oysters. Heat and strain the liquor, 
thickening it with corn starch to the consistency of drawn 
butter. After it has boiled up once add the oysters, and cook 
them for three minutes. Then take them off the fire, add 
the juice of half a lemon, a little nutmeg, a lump of butter 
the size of an egg, and the yolk of one egg stirred in last of 
all. Eat it while hot. 



FISH AND SHELLFISH. 65 



FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Strain one and a half quarts of oysters, and boil the liquor 
with a little parsley, and, if you like, a little onion, pepper 
and salt. Put in the oysters and let them come to a boil. 
Mix one tablespoon ful of butter, with half a spoonful of 
flour, and stir it in to thicken it. Boil half a pint of milk 
with the yolk of one or two raw eggs. Put the milk when 
boiled into the tureen and pour the oysters in. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

Scald the oysters in their own liquor until plump. Then 
take them out, lay them on a dish, and cover with a cloth two 
or three double. Strain the liquor through a coarse cloth, then 
boil it. Season with whole black pepper, salt and a few pieces 
of mace. When cold add a glass of wine and one of vinegar 
to every gallon of liquor. Then add the oysters. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take fine large oysters and drain them well. To one quart 
have ready three eggs well beaten and seasoned with salt and 
pepper. Dip the oysters in the eggs, then in pounded cracker 
until well covered. Have the lard boiling, put in the oysters 
and be careful not to burn them. Serve on a flat dish. Gar- 
nish with slices of lemon. Do not pound cracker too fine. 

DEVILLED CRABS. 

Have the crabs nicely picked and see that none of the shell 
is left in them. Then chop them fine and to two dozen crabs, 
allow one pound of butter, a little cayenne pepper and salt. 
Have the shells clean and nice, and add a small lump of 
butter to each one. Fill them with the seasoned crabs, and 
sprinkle them with a little powdered cracker. Put them in 
the oven and let them remain until they are a light brown. 
They may be eateii either hot or cold.

66 FISH AND SHELLFISH. 

SOFT SHELL CRABS. 

Soft crabs are nothing more than hard crabs after shedding 
their shells. They merely get too large for their shells and 
slip out. Yet they taste very differently. In twenty-four 
hours they are hard again ; this accounts for the short supply. 

TO COOK SOFT SHELL CRABS. 

Take the shell and remove all the spongy substance on 
both sides ; remove the apron or a small loose shell rising to 
a point in the middle of the under shell ; wash them nicely. 
I think it safest and best to remove all the fat as it is so 
delicate it sours in cooking. Fry in butter, adding little 
salt and cayenne pepper. I prefer them without the backs, 
but most people do not. 

CRAB CROQUETTES. 

Pick the meat carefully and chop fine, leaving out the fat. 
Season with cayenne pepper and salt, and to a dozen croquettes 
a large iron spoon of butter, a little rich cream; add two 
well-beaten eggs. Mix all up. Make in forms of croquettes 
and dip in cracker and egg, and boil in very hot lard. Every- 
thing is better boiled than fried in lard. It is best to use a 
wire frying-basket, so they will not break up. 



VEGETABLES. 



A KITCHEN TIME TABLE. 
A Schedule Useful in Cooking Summer Vegetables. 

Early peas will boil in half or three-quarters of an hour. 
They are best put on with cold water ; add salt when nearly done. 

String beans require two hours or more. The first water 
should always be poured off. 

Lima beans will cook in three-quarters of an hour. Put 
on to cook in hot water. 

Asparagus will boil in three-quarters of an hour. Use 
cold water. 

Spinach will boil in fifteen minutes. Use hot water. 

Summer beets will boil in one hour. Use hot water. 

Winter beets will require three hours. Use hot water. 

Corn will boil in twenty minutes. Use hot water. 

Onions will boil in one and a half hours. Use hot water. 

New potatoes will boil in one-half hour. Use boiling water. 

Dried corn must be soaked over night. Allow to cook 
one hour. 

Summer squash is better steamed, as putting it in water 
makes it too watery. Cook three-quarters of an hour. 

Turnips require a long time to cook. If cut thin, they 
will cook in an hour and a quarter; but if only cut in halves, 
it will take two hours and a half. 

FRENCH WAY OF DRESSING LIMA BEANS. 

Boil the beans in the usual way, then pour the water off 
(not drain dry) and add butter, pepper and salt sufficient to 

67 



68 VEGETABLES. 

season them ; put them on coals and stew them. Just before 
they are dished, beat the yolk of an egg very light and stir it 
in the beans. Do not put them on the fire after the egg is 
added. 

BOILED PEAS. 

They should be fresh when cooked and boiled in just enough 
water to cover them, which should be salted and boiling when 
the peas are put in. Let them cook only twenty minutes, 
unless old, and keep the vessel uncovered. Drain off all the 
water. Pour melted butter over them. 

TO BAKE SALSIFY. 

Boil the salsify until the skin comes off easily; then slice 
and put in a baking-dish a layer of sliced salsify and one of 
bread-crumbs, with pepper and salt, with a thin covering of 
butter. Repeat the layers until the dish is filled, finishing 
with bread-crumbs. Then pour in as much milk as the dish 
will hold, and a good spoonful of butter, put in oven and 
bake brown. It will be done in half an hour. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Grate six ears of corn and mix with two eggs, one spoonful 
butter, pepper and salt to taste, one tablespoon flour. Fry brown. 

CURLED SAVOY CABBAGE COOKED LIKE 
CAULIFLOWER. 

Take hard heads, quarter them, put in to boil with a little 
salt and a pinch of soda in the water, say half teaspoonful. 
Let it boil until tender. Drain off and serve with drawn 
butter. 

TO BOIL RICE DRY. 

Pick the rice clean and wash it in two cold waters, not 
draining off the last water until ready to put the rice on 
the fire. Prepare a saucepan of water with a little salt in 
it. When it boils sprinkle in the rice. Boil it hard twenty 



VEGETABLES. 69 

minutes, keeping it covered. Then take it from the fire, 
pour off the water, and then set the saucepan on the back of 
the range with the lid off, while the rest of the dinner is being 
dished, so as to allow the rice time to dry and the grains to 
separate. Rice, if properly cooked, should be soft and white 
and each grain should stand alone. 

HINTS FOR ROASTING POTATOES. 

When you think the potatoes are done take them from 
the stove, and beat them gently so as to let the steam out, 
then return them to the oven and let them remain till they 
are needed. In this way they can be kept hot without injury 
to the potato. 

CORN PUDDING. 

Scrape the substance out of twelve ears of tender green corn. 
(It is better scraped than grated as you do not get the husky 
particles which you cannot avoid with a grater.) Add the 
yolks and whites of four eggs beaten separately, one teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, the same of flour mixed in a tablespoonful of 
butter, a small quantity of salt and pepper and one pint of 
milk. Bake about half an hour or three-quarters. 

SPINACH. 

It should be cooked so as to retain its bright green color, 
and not sent to table, as it so often is, of a dull brown or 
olive color. In order to retain its fresh appearance do not 
cover the vessel while it is cooking. Boil until tender, drain 
in a cullender, chop fine, add a lump of butter, a teacupful of 
rich cream, a teaspoon ful of salt and a little black pepper. 
Serve it hot covered with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

BAKED TOMATOES (whole). 

Cut nice, ripe, smooth fruit in two, lay them in a dripping 
pan in which a small piece of butter has been melted, placing 



70 VEGETABLES. 

the skin side down. Set over a brisk fire. When the under 
side is brown take them off the fire. Place them in an earthen 
baking dish, in which place them skin side down one at a time, 
being careful not to break them. In each one put a small piece 
of butter, a little salt and pepper and dredge a small portion 
of flour over them all. Place in a slow oven and bake them 
three hours. When done, carefully place one at a time on 
the dish in which they are to be served, and send them hot* 
to table. This is excellent. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Scald and skin the tomatoes (unless canned), and place 
them in a stewpan without water. Simmer for half an hour. 
Add pepper, salt, a large piece of butter, a spoonful of white 
sugar and very little bread finely grated. Boil up once and 
serve hot. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS. 

Put one and a half pints of medium-sized navy beans into 
a quart bean pot, fill it with water and let it stand overnight. 
In the morning pour off the water and cover the beans with 
fresh water, in which mix one tablespoonful of molasses. Put 
a quarter pound of pickled pork in the centre, leaving a quarter 
inch of pork above the beans. Bake them eight hours with a 
steady fire, and without stirring the beans add a cupful of water 
every hour but the last two. Earthen pots with narrow mouths 
are made expressly for baking beans. Cooking them in this 
manner, without first boiling them, renders each bean perfectly 
whole, and at the same time thoroughly cooked. When done 
place the pork in the centre of a dish with the beans around it. 

POTATOES BAKED WITH BEEF. 

Pare potatoes of equal size and put them in the oven in the 
same pan in which the beef is baked. Every time the beef is 
basted baste the potatoes also. Serve them around the beef. 



VEGETABLES. 71 

SARATOGA POTATOES. 

Have a little plane or cabbage cutter. Take two or three 
fine large potatoes and pare them. Cut them by rubbing 
them over the plane into slices as thin or thinner than a 
wafer. Put them for a few moments in ice water to become 
chilled. Then test some boiling lard to see if it is of the 
proper temperature. The slices must color quickly, but the 
fat must not be so hot as to turn them dark. Have ready 
some salt and a dish for the potatoes ; also a tin plate and a 
perforated ladle. Throw the slices of cold potato separately 
into the hot lard keep them separated till they are of a delicate 
yellow color. Then skim them out on the tin plate, sprinkle 
them with salt and put them in the dish. Only fry five or six 
slices at a time until all are cooked. Two potatoes will make 
a large dishful. 

BEETS. 

If they are winter beets soak them overnight ; in any case 
be very careful not to prick or cut the skin before boiling, as 
they will then lose their color. Put them into boiling water 
and boil until tender. If they are served hot pour a little 
melted butter, pepper and salt over them. They are often 
served cold cut into slices, with vinegar over them, or cut into 
dice and mixed with other cold vegetables for a winter salad. 

MACARONI WITH CHEESE. 

Do not wash the macaroni. Throw it, broken into pieces 
of two or three inches, into boiling, well-salted water. Stir 
or shake it frequently to prevent its adhering to the bottom 
of the stewpan. The moment it is quite tender pour it into a 
cullender and shake off all the water. In the mean time melt 
about two ounces of butter to a half pound of macaroni, and 
grate a handful of cheese. When the macaroni is well drained, 
place a little of it in the bottom of the dish in which it is to be 
served. Pour over it some of the melted butter, and sprinkle 



72 VEGETABLES. 

over that a little grated cheese. Continue alternate layers of 
the three ingredients until all the macaroni is in, placing butter 
and cheese on top. Put the dish in the oven and let it remain 
three or four minutes, or long enough for the macaroni to soak 
the butter and cheese. Then take it out, brown the top with 
a salamander or hot kitchen shovel, and it is ready to serve. 
It requires about twenty minutes to boil macaroni. You 
should try to have it done just the moment of serving, other- 
wise the cheese will cool and harden. 

TO COOK CRANBERRIES. 

To one quart cranberries put one teacup of water, and place 
them on the fire. Cook ten minutes, then add two heaping 
cupsful of sugar, and cook about ten minutes more, stirring 
often. Pour them into a bowl or mould, then when cold 
they can be removed as a jelly. The berries will seem very 
dry before the sugar is added, but if more water is used they 
will not jelly. This is an accompaniment to roast turkey. 

TO FRY EGG-PLANTS. 

Cut the egg-plant early in the morning, about three-quarters 
of an inch thick, and sprinkle with salt. Put a weight on 
them ; let them stand for some hours. Then have ready 
eggs beaten up and seasoned high. Dip the egg-plant in the 
egg, then the cracker dust, and fry in boiling lard. Very fine. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape and wash them ; let them boil until very tender. 
Press them in a cullender, mash them very fine, season them 
with pepper and salt, and dredge a little flour over them. 
Then make them into cakes and fry a light brown. 

CYML1NGS. 

Cut them in quarters, wash and boil them in salted water 
until tender. When done put them into a cullender and press 



VEGETABLES. 73 

out all the water. While warm add a small piece of butter, 
and season with a little more salt and cream. Put them in a 
covered dish, and before sending to table sprinkle a little black 
pepper. These are very nice fried like egg-plant. 

FRIED EGG-PLANT. 

Cut them in slices about half an inch thick, cover them 
with salt, and put them in a cullender to let them drain. 
When well drained wipe them, season them with pepper and 
salt, dredge a little flour over each, and put them in a pan 
with some hot butter. Fry them slowly till they are soft and 
dark brown on both sides. Serve very hot. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Choose one that is white. Take off the outside leaves and 
put it in boiling water with some salt. Skim and boil it 
slowly, when done take it up in a cullender and press out the 
water. Put it in a vegetable dish, cover with drawn butter and 
serve. Boiled cabbage is cooked in a similar manner. The 
secret of keeping the smell of boiled cabbage from spreading 
through the house is to put a piece of stale bread in a piece of 
muslin and place it in the pot with the cabbage, keeping the pot 
well covered. It can be dressed simply with salt and butter. 

BAKED CABBAGE. 

Boil in salt and water until tender ; then cut up fine in a 
baking dish, adding butter, pepper and salt, and a little 
cream and stale bread crumbs or crackers beaten in the top. 
A very nice dish. 

TURNIPS. 

Pare and wash them, boil until tender, then take them up 
in a cullender, press out all the water, put them in a pan, 
and mash them very fine. Season with salt, butter and a 
little cream. If they are not sweet add one teaspoonful 



74 VEGETABLES. 

white sugar. When ready to serve sprinkle a little black 
pepper over them. 

HOT SLAW. 

Cut up the cabbage, but not so fine as for cold slaw. 
Put it in a pan, sprinkle a little salt over it, and half a 
gill of water. Set it on the stove and cover it close. 
It must cook one hour. When quite tender put in two 
ounces of butter and as much vinegar as will make it 
sufficiently sour. Serve it hot. 

GREEN CORN PUDDING. 

Grate the corn from twelve large ears of corn, add one 
quart milk, six eggs, two tablespoonsful melted butter, and 
a little salt. Bake slowly, and let it brown on top. Beat 
the eggs separately, mix the corn and yolks together, and 
stir hard ; then add the butter and then the milk slowly. 
Last of all put in the whites. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Allow one egg and a half to every cup of grated corn, 
and one tablespoonful of cream or milk. Beat eggs very 
light, add salt to taste, one and a half tablespoons melted 
butter to every pint of corn. Stir in the milk, and thicken 
it with a little flour, just enough to hold them together. 
Add pepper. Allow one tablespoonful of the mixture to 
every two eggs. Test it a little at first to see if it is 
right. Fry in cakes in hot lard. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

Let them lie in cold water after being washed. Then pour 
boiling water over them, as soon as they appear mealy. Pour 
water off; let them stand a few moments on the back of the 
stove to dry. Then mash through a potato strainer or serve 
whole. 



VEGETABLES. 75 

BAKED EGG-PLANT. 

Boil the egg-plant, pare it and mash it up with a little but- 
ter, pepper, bread-crumbs, a small portion of boiled onion and 
nutmeg if you like. Bake in a shallow dish a few minutes, 
adding plenty of butter, half a cup of cream or rich milk. 

TO SCALLOP TOMATOES. 

Peel off the skin from large, full-ripe tomatoes, put a layer in 
the bottom of a deep dish, and cover it well with grated bread- 
crumbs. Add pepper and salt and some bits of butter. Put 
alternate layers of each till the dish is full, having the top 
layer of crumbs and butter. Bake it a nice brown. 

POTATO FRITTERS. 

Grate six cold boiled potatoes, add to them one pint of 
cream or new milk, flour enough to make as stiff as other 
fritters, the yolks of three or four eggs, then the beaten whites 
and a little salt. Fry in hot lard or butter. These are 
delicious. 

GREEN CORN (Boiled). 

Green corn is too often spoiled by being left too long in the 
water. Very young corn is cooked in ten minutes, and any 
that is not tender in twenty minutes is too hard to be eaten at 
all. Husk the corn, remove the silk, and cut out all imperfect 
places. Put the ears into an iron pot, fill it with boiling water, 
cover the pot closely, and let it boil for fifteen minutes. Corn 
is delicious if boiled in the inside husk, removing it before 
serving. It can be loosened to take out the silk and drawn 
up again. 

MACARONI MILANESE. 

Throw the macaroni into boiling water, allowing it plenty 
of room for swelling. Add some salt and let it boil for twenty- 
five minutes. Drain it in a cullender, then put it into a deep 



76 VEGETABLES. 

earthenware baking dish, in successive layers of macaroni and 
grated cheese. A little cayenne pepper greatly improves the 
flavor. Lay on the top slices of fresh butter, a quarter pound 
being enough for a large dishful. Pour over it enough un- 
skimmed morning's milk to cover the whole, and bake in a 
regularly heated oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve 
up quickly, and do not let it become dry by exposure to too 
intense a heat. 

STEWED POTATOES. 

Peal and slice the potatoes. Put them into a saucepan, 
cover with boiling water, and boil until tender; then pour off 
the water. Koll a large piece of butter in flour and beat it 
in half a pint of hot milk till smooth. Season with pepper 
and salt and boil. When boiling, put in the potatoes ; stew 
together for five minutes and serve very hot. 

FRIED SALSIFY. 

Stew the salsify as usual till very tender, then mash it very 
fine. Beat up an egg, add one teacupful of milk, a little flour, 
butter and seasoning of pepper and salt. Make into cakes and 
fry in boiling lard till light brown. 

STEWED SALSIFY. 

Wash the roots and scrape off their skins, throwing them as 
you do so in cold water immediately, otherwise they will turn 
dark. Then cut transversely into little bits, throw them into 
fresh water; add a little salt and stew in a covered vessel 
until tender. Pour off the water ; add a small lump of but- 
ter, a little pepper and a gill of sweet cream. 

BROILED TOMATOES. 

Take nice firm tomatoes, slice them about half an inch thick, 
dip them in corn meal or cracker dust. Season them high 
with pepper and salt, then fry them in butter. When brown, 



VEGETABLES, 77 

take them out and lay them on a covered dish. Then take 
half a teacup of sweet cream and stir it in the spider where the 
tomatoes were cooked. Stir it well and let it get thoroughly 
hot, and serve in the covered dish. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Take good-sized ripe tomatoes. Make a hole in the centre 
and fill with stale bread-crumbs, butter, pepper and salt. Put 
it in the stove and bake until done. Serve on a flat dish. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

Put them in a steamer and let them remain until done, and 
the skins can be easily removed ; then slice them lengthwise, 
and put them in a baking dish with plenty of butter. Sprinkle 
a little brown sugar all through them ; add a little water in 
the bottom of the dish and put it in to bake until brown. 
Serve it in the dish in which it is baked. 

STEWED POTATOES (for Breakfast). 

Pare, quarter and soak them in cold water for half an hour. 
Stew them in enough cold salted water to cover them. Before 
taking them up, and when they are breaking to pieces, drain 
off half the water and put in a cupful of milk. Boil it three 
minutes, stirring well ; put in a lump of butter the size of 
an egg, a little salt and a pinch of pepper. Boil up well 
and put it in a covered dish. Add parsley and onion if 
one likes it. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Top, tail and skin them, lay them in cold water for half an 
hour or more, then put them in a saucepan with hot water 
enough to cover them. When half done throw off all the 
water except about a teacupful. Add a like quantity of milk, 
a great spoonful of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Stew 



78 VEGETABLES. 

gently until tender, then turn into a deep dish. If the 
onions are strong and large boil them in three waters, throw- 
ing away all of the first and second, and keeping a little 
of the third to mix with the milk. 

HOMINY CROQUETTES. 

To a cupful of cold boiled hominy add a tablespoon of 
melted butter, and stir hard, moistening by degrees with a 
cupful of milk, beating to a soft light paste. Put in a teaspoon 
of white sugar, and last, a well-beaten egg. Roll into oval 
balls with floured hands, dip in beaten egg, then cracker- 
crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

Half a cup of rice, one pint of milk, two tablespoons of 
sugar, three eggs, a little grated lemon peel, one tablespoon of 
melted butter and a saltspoon of salt. Soak the rice for three 
hours in warm water enough to cover it. Drain almost dry 
and pour in the milk. Stew in one saucepan set in another of 
hot water, till the rice is very tender. Add the sugar, butter 
and salt, and simmer ten minutes. Whisk the eggs to a froth, 
and add them cautiously, taking the saucepan from the fire 
while you whip them in. Return it to the stove and stir 
while thickening, not allowing them to boil. Remove the 
pan and add the lemon peel, then turn it out upon a well- 
greased dish to cool. When cold and stiff roll with floured 
hands into shape, dip in beaten egg, then cracker-crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

SOUTHERN WAY OF COOKING RICE DRY. 

Pick over the rice, rinse in cold water until perfectly 
clean, then put in a pot of boiling water. Allow one quart 
of water to less than a teacup of rice, boil hard seventeen 



VEGETABLES. 79 

minutes, drain off the water very close, let it steam with 
the lid off fifteen minutes. When carefully done each 
grain will be separate. 

STEWED MACARONI. 

Break the macaroni into inch lengths; stew twenty minutes, 
or till tender. Have the following sauce ready : Cut half a 
pound of beef into strips, and stew half an hour in cold water. 
Then add a minced onion and one pint tomatoes, peeled and 
sliced. Boil an hour and strain through a cullender after 
taking out the meat. The sauce should be well boiled down 
by this time. One pint is sufficient for a large dish of maca- 
roni. Return the liquid to the saucepan ; add a large piece 
of butter, pepper and salt, and stew till ready to dish the 
macaroni. Drain this well ; sprinkle lightly with salt and 
heap it in a dish. Pour the tomato sauce over it. Cover 
and let it stand in a warm place ten minutes before sending 
to table. Send grated cheese around with it. 

BAKED CYMLINGS. 

Boil the cymlings until tender ; then rub them through the 
cullender. Then season with butter, cream and pepper and 
salt, and bake in a baking dish. Very nice. 

BOILED RICE, SAVANNAH STYLE. 

Take one pound of rice, pick it clean, take out all dark 
grains. Put on the fire in a porcelain-lined pot, three quarts 
of water with two teaspoonsful of salt ; let the water come to 
a boil. Now wash the rice in three waters. The reason for 
this is to get rid of the pulverized rice-flour which adheres 
to the grains. This is a necessity ; otherwise the rice never 
will be dry. Throw the rice in water when it is at full 
boil. Let the rice boil for twenty minutes rapidly. Put 



80 VEGETABLES. 

the cover on and drain the water entirely off; cover the 
pot, shake well, and put on the back of the stove, where 
it is not too hot, for fifteen minutes. Shake the rice into 
the dish you wish it served; never use a spoon. Rice 
should never be glutinous. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS. 

Take fresh mushrooms, wash and skin them carefully ; 
then put them on a broiler over a hot fire, and when done, 
pour melted butter and pepper and salt. Serve very hot. 

HASHED BROWN POTATOES. 

Boil potatoes half-done, cut in pieces size of dice ; then put 
on to stew with cream, butter, pepper and salt, a little onion 
juice and parsley. Then put in a dish and brown over. 
Serve hot. 



EGGS. 



OMELET. 

Take six eggs, beat them separately, add a little parsley 
chopped fine (some small pieces of ham also if desired). Fry 
in butter on one side only. Put the dish on the omelet, and 
turn the pan over so as not to break it. Serve immediately. 

EGG OMELET. 

Six eggs, one teacup of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, 
and one teaspoonful of flour, one teaspoouful of salt. Beat 
the whites and yolks separately, warm the milk enough 
to melt the butter, add this to the yolks. Make the flour 
into a paste with a little of the milk. Add the whites 
last. Either bake in a deep dish or in shallow pans, and 
double it over after it browns. 

OMELET (with Bread-crumbs). 

Soak a teacupful of bread-crumbs overnight in a cup 
of new milk. Beat separately the yolks and whites of 
three eggs. Mix the yolks with the bread and milk, stir 
in the whites, add salt and make as usual. 

DEVILLED EGGS. 

Boil hard nine eggs, cut them lengthwise ; take out all the 
yolks ; mash it, add cupful of cream, tablespoonful of melted 
butter, little onion chopped fine or celery seed if you don't 
6 81 



82 EGGS. 

like onion, a little parsley chopped fine, pepper and salt. ' Mix 
all together, refill the whites with the mixture, add a little 
beaten cracker. Set in the stove in a pan with a little water 
to brown. 

OMELET (with Parsley). 

Beat two eggs, yolks and whites together, until very 
light. Mix one teaspoonful of corn starch, with a scant 
half teacupful of milk. When well stirred and smooth 
pour this over the eggs, and beat all well together for 
a few minutes ; add a little chopped parsley, 

BAKED EGGS. 

Set in the oven until quite hot, a common white dish large 
enough to hold the number of eggs to be cooked, allowing 
plenty of room for each. Melt in it a small piece of butter, 
and breaking the eggs carefully in a saucer, one at a time, 
slip them into the hot dish. Sprinkle over them a small 
quantity of salt and pepper, and allow them to cook four or 
five minutes. Add a tablespoonful of cream for every two 
eggs when the eggs are first slipped in the dish. 

DROPPED EGGS. 

Break the eggs in a saucer one at a time, being careful to 
keep the yolk from breaking. Have ready in a dripping- 
pan some boiling water or milk. Into this slide the eggs, 
letting them cook until set. Take them up in a skimmer, 
put them on a dish, season with butter, pepper and salt, 
and if preferred put them on buttered toast. 

EGG TOAST. 

Take two eggs, one and a half cups milk, and flour enough 
for a stiff batter. Cut stale bread thin, dip in the batter, 
and fry brown in butter. 



EGGS. 83 

OMELET SOUFFLEE. 

Three tablespoonsful of sugar, beaten yolks of five eggs 
mixed together, flavored with teaspoonful of vanilla, and a 
very little salt ; beat whites of four eggs stiff, and mix all 
together. Bake for ten minutes and eat while hot. 

OMELET SOUFFLEE. 

Separate the yolks of twelve eggs from the whites. Put 
the yolks of five in a deep dish with one-half pound sugar, 
one teaspoonful of vanilla ; beat all together for ten minutes. 
Put the whites of your eggs in a large bowl, and beat them 
very stiff; then mix them with your yolks and sugar. But- 
ter a dish into which pour the above. Put it in a moderate 
oven, about twelve minutes; sprinkle sugar on top and serve 
immediately. 

BOILED EGGS. 

To try the freshness of eggs, put them into cold water; 
those that sink are the best. Always let the water boil 
before putting the eggs in. Three minutes will boil them 
soft. In four minutes the whites will be completely done, 
and in eight they will be all hard boiled. 

BREAKFAST DISH OF EGGS. 

Boil six eggs hard, chop them up in a dish ; add bread- 
crumbs, a good-sized lump of butter, pepper and salt; 
pour over it half a pint of boiled milk and bake in 
the dish. 

ANOTHER NICE DISH OF EGGS. 

Take six raw eggs. Beat the whites and yolks separately 
very light ; then mix them together. Add a teacup of rich 
milk (cream is better), a lump of butter, pepper and salt and 
a little parsley cut fine. Put them in a baking dish. Now 



84 EGGS. 

place a spider on top of the stove. Put sufficient hot water 
in it to cook the eggs. Stir it all the time. As soon as they 
are thick send at once to the table, as they are not good if 
allowed to stand. 

FRIED EGGS. 

Melt some butter in a frying-pan, and when it hisses drop 
in the eggs carefully. Fry three minutes. Dust them with 
pepper and salt, and put them on a hot dish. 

BREADED EGGS. 

Boil them hard and cut them in round thick slices. 
Sprinkle with pepper and salt; dip each in beaten egg, 
then in fine bread-crumbs or powdered cracker, and fry 
in nice dripping or butter hissing hot. Drain off every 
drop of grease, and serve on a hot dish with sauce like 
that for fricasseed eggs, poured over them. 

OMELET WITH CHIPPED BEEF. (Very nice.) 

Beat the yolks and whites of eight eggs separately. Put 
two and a half tablespoonsful of smoked beef chipped fine in 
a frying pan, with two tablespoonsful of butter. Let them 
cook a few moments ; season the eggs with pepper and salt ; 
mix together. Pour in the beef; turn them as plain omelet. 
When brown, serve hot, garnished with parsley. 

PLAIN OMELET. 

Beat six eggs very light, the whites to a stiff froth, and the 
yolks to a smooth batter. To the latter, add a small cup of 
milk, pepper and salt, and lastly the whites, lightly stirred in. 
Have ready in a hot frying-pan a good lump of butter. When 
it hisses, pour in the mixture gently and set over a clear fire. 
Cook not more than ten minutes. Do not stir it, but as the 
eggs " set " slip a broad blade knife under the omelet, to keep 



EGGS. 85 

it from burning. The instant hiss of the butter as it flows to 
the hottest part of the pan, will prove the wisdom of this 
precaution. If the oven is hot, set the frying-pan in it when 
the middle of the omelet is set. When done, turn it over on 
a dish. Eat immediately. I know by experience that these 
directions are worthy of note. 

CHEESE OMELET, NO. i. 

One cup of bread-crumbs, one cup of grated cheese, two 
cups of milk, pinch of salt, little red pepper, two eggs 
beaten light, and added last. Bake five or six minutes 
in a quick oven. 

PLAIN OMELET. (Very fine.) 

Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten very light separately, half 
pint sweet milk, six teaspoonsful of corn starch, dissolved in 
milk very smoothly, one teaspoon of baking powder, salt and 
pepper, add the whites last, cook in butter. When nicely 
browned, roll over on a hot dish. Serve at once.

EGG CUTLETS FOR SUMMER. 

Egg cutlets are a new and delicious dainty for summer 
luncheons, and are as palatable as, while much less expensive 
than, sweetbreads or other delicate meat dishes. To make 
from four to six cutlets, requires three hard-boiled eggs, 
one cupful of milk, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonsful of flour. 
Cover the eggs with boiling water, and simmer them half 
an hour in a covered saucepan. Heat the milk in a double 
boiler, rub together the butter and flour, add to the milk, 
and stir until you have a thick, smooth mixture ; season 
with one-half teaspoonful of onion juice and the parsley. 
Shell the eggs, cut them or chop them fine, and mix well 
with the sauce. Turn on a buttered platter and set in the 
ice-box until very cold. Then flour your hands and your 
molding-board, take a small quantity of the mixture in your 



EGGS. 87 

hands, and mold it into the shape of a small cutlet about 
an inch thick. When ready to fry, the cutlets are to be coated 
with egg, and then with fine dry bread-crumbs, laid a few at 
a time in the frying basket and browned in boiling fat. The 
cutlets are served with a white sauce, garnished with green 
peas. To make the sauce, blend a tablespoonful of butter, the 
same quantity of flour, and a cupful of milk or cream, and 
when smooth season with a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
white pepper and a half cupful of cooked green peas. Pour 
the sauce around, not over, the cutlets.

butter the size of an egg, the juice of half a lemon, and two or 
three sprigs of sparsley chopped very fine, pepper and salt all 
together. Spread this over any broiled meat or fish when hot. 
Then put the dish into the oven a few moments, to allow the 
butter to penetrate the meat. 

MINT SAUCE. 

Put four tablespoonsful of chopped mint, two tablespoonsful 
of sugar, and one quarter pint of vinegar into the sauce-boat. 
Let it remain an hour or two before dinner that the vinegar 
may be impregnated with the mint. Used for roast lamb. 

TOMATO SAUCE. 

Stew six tomatoes half an hour, with two cloves, a sprig of 
parsley, pepper and salt. Press this through a sieve. Put a 
little butter into a saucepan over the fire, and when it bubbles, 
add a heaping teaspoonful of flour. Mix and cook it well, 
then add the tomato pulp, stirring until it is smooth. Three 
or four tablespoonsful of stock will make a great improvement, 
and some add a few slices of onion at first. 

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE. 

Pour four tablespoonsful of good vinegar into a small stew- 
pan, and add some peppercorns and salt. Let this boil till 
reduced one-half; let it cool, then add to it the well-beaten 
yolks of four or five eggs, also four ounces of butter, more salt 
if necessary, and a very little nutmeg. Set the stew-pan on a 
very slow fire, and stir the liquid till about as thick as cream, 



SAUCES AND DRESSINGS FOR SALADS. 91 

then remove it immediately. Now put this stew-pan into 
another pan containing a little warm water kept at the side of 
the fire. Work the sauce briskly with a spoon, or with a little 
whisk, so as to get it frothy, adding little bits of butter (about 
as much as half the size of an egg). When the sauce has become 
light and smooth it is ready for use. It is used for boiled fish, 
cauliflower or asparagus. 

ANOTHER HOLLANDAISE RECIPE.

saucepan, and when it bubbles stir in with an egg whisk, an 
even tablespoonful of flour ; let it continue to bubble until the 
flour is thoroughly cooked, when stir in half a pint of boiling 
water, or better still, of veal stock. When it boils take it from 
the fire, and stir into it gradually the beaten yolks of four eggs. 
Return the sauce to the fire for a minute to set the eggs without 
allowing it to boil. Again remove the sauce, stir in the juice 
of half a small lemon and fresh butter the size of a walnut, cut 
small to facilitate its melting. Stir all well with a whisk. 

ESPAGNOLE SAUCE.

mushrooms till they are tender, then thicken the gravy slightly 
with a roux of butter and flour. Add a few drops of lemon 
juice, and then pour over the meat. To be served with beef- 
steaks, fillets of beef. 

ROUX. 

Eoux is a mixture of butter and flour cooked. It is 
generally added uncooked to thicken a sauce or a soup, but 
the flavor is much better if it is first cooked, and the sauce or 
soup added to it. When the butter first comes to a boil in a 
small stew-pan the sifted flour is sprinkled in, and both are 
mixed well together over the fire with an egg whisk until 
the flour is well cooked. A part of the sauce or soup is then 
stirred in until it becomes smooth and thin enough to add to 
the main sauce or soup. If the roux is intended for a white 
sauce it is not allowed to color ; if for a brown sauce it may 
be colored, or brown flour may be used. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Rub two teaspoonsful of flour into a quarter pound of butter 
and five teaspoonsful of cold water, set it in boiling water till 
it melts, and when it begins to simmer it is done. Do not 
set it on the stove as it fries the butter and spoils it. Work 
the flour in the butter so thoroughly as not to be lumpy. If 
it is to be used with fish, add hard-boiled eggs chopped fine. 
If with boiled fowl, put in oysters while it is simmering and 
let them become thoroughly heated. 

HORSE-RADISH SAUCE. 

Four tablespoonsful of grated horse-radish, one teaspoonful 
sugar, one of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, two of mixed

or pickle is a very good sauce. But other things can be added 
to sauces. 

OLIVE SAUCE. 

Quarter pound French olives, half a pint stock, one tea- 
spoonful lemon juice, salt and a little cayenne pepper. Care- 
fully stone the olives by paring them round in ribbons so

motion or it may curdle. After adding one gill of oil, alter- 
nate occasionally with a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar,

according to the quantity of dressing wanted. With care a 
quart bottle of oil may be stirred into the yolks of two eggs, 
alternating with a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar, after 
adding the first gill of oil. 

In case the dressing should curdle, i. e., the egg and oil 
separate, which makes the dressing liquid ; begin anew at 
once with the yolks of two eggs in another plate, and after 
stirring them well, add by teaspoonsful the curdled mayon- 
naise, stirring all the while, and then finish by adding more 
oil as directed. In warm weather put the dish in which you 
make the mayonnaise on a piece of ice or in a pan of cold 
water; the oil and eggs should also be very cold. This 
dressing, if closely covered, will keep in the ice for a week. 
Tarragon vinegar may be used if desired.

curdling, and set it aside to cool. When perfectly cold add 
two tablespoonsful of Lautier's olive oil, or two-thirds of a

work it thoroughly with a fork and spoon, turning it over and 
over, so that the lettuce may be thoroughly impregnated

TERRAPIN, PHILADELPHIA STYLE. 

Terrapins should be boiled, or rather thrown alive into 
boiling water for twenty minutes, and then taken out, carefully 
skinned, and the toe-nails taken off. This first water in all 
cases should be thrown away, as all the solvents of the body 
are contained in it, otherwise the terrapin will have a strong 
taste. Boil it for two hours in fresh water, or, if the terrapins 
are large, until the legs can be taken off easily, or the shells 
become detached. Take off first the two hind legs, and then 
carefully take out the sand bag and the end of the alimentary

canal, which generally contains the last digested food. Then 
break off the fore legs, clean the head, and break up the neck ; 
cut up the entrails fine, and carefully detach the eggs. Have 
a bowl of cold water ready to wash off the liver in case the 
gall should be broken in boiling. If not broken, detach it 
with a sharp knife from the liver, and should it break in 
handling plunge the pieces stained by it in cold water. 

The Dressing. For a full count terrapin : The yolks of 
four hard-boiled eggs should be rubbed up with one quarter 
pound of butter, one-half teacupful browned flour, one table- 
spoonful mustard, salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper to 
taste. When the dressing is boiling add the terrapin, stirring 
all the time to prevent scorching. Just before taking from the 
fire, add a tumblerful of Sherry wine and boil up once. Serve 

hot. 

TERRAPIN, MARYLAND STYLE. 

Terrapins should be well washed, then thrown in a pot of 
boiling water, keeping the top on very tightly, as they are 
really better cooked with as little water as possible ; principally 
by steam, is the best mode. You can tell when they are done, 
by the skin coming off easily, and also the bones leaving the 
meat. We use all of the terrapin, except the sand bag, and 
the end of the alimentary canal, which generally contains the 
last digested food. Cut up the entrails fine, and be careful in 
taking the liver from the gall ; if the gall should break before 
taking it out, a little of the gall is an improvement to the 
terrapin. Cut it all up, and put in a chafing dish, to three 
large terrapins, one pound of butter, a little cayenne pepper, 
and salt, and add Sherry wine at the table, if you like it. 

SWEETBREADS. 

Veal sweetbreads are the best. They spoil very soon. The 
moment they come from market they should be put into cold 
water to soak for about an hour. Lard them or rather draw 
a lardon of pork through the centre of each sweetbread, and 



SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 107 

put them into salted boiling water, or if you have it, stock, 
and let them boil about twenty minutes or until they are 
thoroughly done. Throw them then into cold water for only 
a few moments. They will now be firm and white. Remove 
carefully the skin and little pipes, and put them in the 
coolest place until ready to cook again. The simplest way 
to cook them is to fry them. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

Parboil them as just explained. Just before serving cut 
them in even-sized pieces, sprinkle them with pepper and 
salt, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry them in hot lard. 
They are sometimes immersed in boiling lard, yet oftener 
fried in the saute pan. If saute, when done put them on a 
hot dish, and turn out part of the lard from the saute pan, 
leaving about half a teaspoonful. Pour in a cupful of milk 
thickened with a little flour. Let it cook, stirring constantly 
and season with pepper and salt ; strain it and pour it over the 
sweetbreads. With green peas, serve without sauce. Sometimes 
they are served whole with cauliflower or asparagus heads, when 
the cream sauce is poured over both. They are excellent with 
tomato sauce or with macaroni cooked with cheese. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

Two chickens and two sets of brains, both boiled, two sprigs 
of parsley chopped, one nutmeg grated, one even tablespoonful 
of finely chopped onion, the juice and grated rind of one lemon, 
salt, black and red pepper to taste. Chop the meat very fine ; 
mix all well together and add cream until it is quite moist, or 
just right for moulding. This quantity will make two dozen 
croquettes. Mould them into the shape of pears; dip them 
into beaten egg, and roll them in cracker dust or bread-crumbs, 
then fry in boiling lard. Any kind of cold meat can be made 
into croquettes, only substituting rice for the brains. 



108 SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 



POTATO SALAD. 

Slice some cold potatoes. In a good size dish chop six 
small onions, also some parsley, salt and a little vinegar to 
the taste. Then before serving put some mayonaise dressing 
over it, and serve very cold just off the ice. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

One and a half pounds of chicken, and two sweetbreads cut 
very fine with a knife ; put a little salt and pepper and a very 
little grated nutmeg in it. Make a gravy of nearly one pint 
of milk ; beat up the yolk of one egg and cook it in the milk, 
then stir in a spoonful of butter, mixed with two-thirds of a 
spoonful of flour. Cook this in the milk till it is ropy, then 
stir the chicken into it, and set it away to cool. Take out 
some of the gravy, as it may make it too soft, then add if 
it is needed. When cool, roll them into shape, dip them 
in white of egg, then in cracker, and boil them in hot lard. 
This makes one dozen croquettes. 

IMITATION TERRAPIN. 

Cut cold chicken, mutton or veal fine; sprinkle it with 
cayenne pepper and salt. Mash the yolks of three hard-boiled 
eggs, and put it with a little wine, walnut catsup, mustard, 
and a lump of butter in a stew-pan five minutes. Have a 
fourth hard-boiled egg, from which take the yolk and roll 
into little eggs like those of a terrapin. Scatter them through 
the dish when ready for the table. Garnish the dish with a 
few slices of lemon and some parsley. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Open a can of lobster and drain it well through a cullender. 
This takes some time. After the liquid is all drained off, have 
ready six eggs boiled hard. Make the yolks into a paste with 



SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 109 

six raw yolks, twenty-four tablespoons of oil, twelve of vine- 
gar, twelve even teaspoons of mustard, and the same of salt. 
Mix well until it is a smooth paste. Sprinkle cayenne 
pepper over it when about to mix, and squeeze the juice 
of one lemon to this quantity. Lettuce is a great addition 
to it. Sturgeon is very nice fixed this way. Fresh lobster 
is much better than the canned. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. 

Take one or more quarts of sour milk, put it in a warm 
place and let it remain till the whey separates from the curd, 
then pour it into a three-cornered bag, hang it up and let 
it drain till every particle of whey has dripped from it. 
Then turn it out and mash it with a spoon until very 
fine, after which add a little milk or cream, with salt to 
taste. If you like, before sending it to table dredge a 
little black pepper over the top. 

OYSTER PATES. 

Take as many fresh oysters as you will need. Drain them, 
then place them on the fire in a stew-pan with butter, a little 
chopped celery, pepper and salt. Stew them, thicken it a 
little with flour and butter rubbed together, and stirred in. 
Let them cook a few moments, then have your pates baked 
and fill them with the oysters. Put them in the oven again, 
and let them bake a few moments until the oysters look a 
little brown. 

CRAB SALAD. 

Prepare the crabs as for devilling, leaving out the fat. 
Then prepare a mayonnaise dressing. Have some nice white 
lettuce; place the leaves in the bottom and all around the 
sides of a flat dish. Heap the picked crab in the centre. 
Put the dressing in a separate dish. Garnish the dish with 
slices of lemon or small red radishes. 



110 SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 

CRAB CROQUETTES. 

Prepare the crabs as for devilling, mince them rather fine. 
Season with butter, cayenne pepper and salt. Make it into 
shapes like croquettes by moulding in a wine-glass. Roll 
them in cracker dust, and fry in boiling lard. Add a little 
flour when moulding them to make them hold in shape. 

BROILED PIGEONS. 

Young pigeons, or squabs, are a great delicacy. Clean, 
wash and dry them carefully with a clean cloth, then split 
them down the back and broil them like spring chickens. 
Season with pepper and salt, and add plenty of butter when 
serving them. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING. 

Mash the hard-boiled yolks of three eggs and the raw yolk 
of one to a perfectly smooth paste, add one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of black pepper, one tablespoonful 
of melted butter, then by degrees, one gill of thick cream, 
working and stirring all the time. Now add two tablespoons- 
ful of vinegar, mix well and it is finished. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Pare and boil three good sized potatoes ; when cold, cut them 
into thin slices, and mix them carefully with one onion chopped 
very fine. Over them pour the following dressing. One tea- 
spoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of black pepper, nine table- 
spoonsful of olive oil, and three of vinegar, stirred thoroughly 
until the salt has all been dissolved. Sprinkle the dish with 
parsley chopped fine and put in a cold place for an hour or two. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

Peel the tomatoes, scoop out the inside carefully so as not to 
break the tomatoes, fill in with chopped celery, dressed with 



SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. Ill 

mayonnaise dressing, or fill with chicken salad. Serve on 
plates with crisp lettuce. 



FRUIT SALAD DRESSING. 



Mix together four tablespoonsful of sugar, one of maraschino, 
two of Champagne if you have it, one gill of sherry ; stir until 
sugar is dissolved, and pour over the fruit. 



FRUIT SALAD. 

Peel and cut in thin slices, bananas, oranges or any kind 
of fruit ; pour over them the fruit-salad dressing, and stand 
on ice for an hour or two. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Rub one-quarter pound of butter and one-half pound of 
flour together; mix lightly six ounces grated cheese with 
cayenne pepper to taste. Make into a light dough with one- 
half teacup of milk, in which dissolve one teaspoonful of 
yeast-powder, and enough ice-water to roll out thin. Cut 
into narrow strips five inches long, and one-half inch wide. 
Bake a light brown in a quick oven. 

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURGH. 

Cut up some fresh lobster in large squares, put it in a sauce- 
pan on the fire, with two glasses of good Sherry. When hot, 
take the yolk of a raw egg, a piece of butter, and half gill of 
cream ; mix slowly with the lobster. Be careful not to let it 
boil any more. Season well to taste, and serve in a deep 
covered dish. Must not stand, but used as soon as made. 
About ten minutes' cooking is sufficient. Chafing-dish is best 

to cook it in. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 

Beat one egg in a saucepan, add to it five tablespoonsful 
grated cheese, one of butter, one-third teaspoonful of salt, a 
little red pepper, one teaspoon of mustard, five tablespoonsful 



112 SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 

of rich milk ; thicken with a little corn starch, which has been 
mixed in a little milk. Serve on toast. 

LOBSTER PATTIES. 

Make some puff paste, and spread it in deep patty pans. 
Bake them before they are filled. Take fresh or canned 
lobster (of course it is always boiled before using); mix with 
it some white stock. Chop the lobster fine, and to a can of 
lobster, or two fresh ones, add the yolks of four hard-boiled 
eggs. Season with cayenne pepper, Sherry wine, nutmeg, 
and a little lemon juice, gill of sweet cream, and a lump 
of butter size of an egg. Let it stew until it comes to a 
boil ; then fill the patties. Serve hot. 

BEEF SAUTE. 

Heat some thick slices of tender boiled beef in melted 
butter; keep the dish covered. When very hot, pour over 
a tablespoonful each of mushroom catsup and Worcestershire 
sauce. Serve on hot plates. 

CHEESE PUDDING. (Philadelphia style.) 

Put in a sauce-pan half a pound of good grated cheese, 
with a pint of new milk, six ounces of grated bread-crumbs, 
and two eggs well beaten ; stir well till the cheese is dissolved, 
then put in a Dutch oven if you have one, or brown with a 
salamander, or be careful in baking it in your range. Serve 
hot for breakfast or lunch. Very nice. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. (Very fine.) 

To one large pullet chicken, well boiled, cut fine, removing 
all skin and gristle, add one pint of rich sweet cream, yolks 
of four eggs, piece butter size of an egg, large spoonful of 
sifted flour; flavor with nutmeg, cayenne pepper and salt. 
Cook over slow fire until the consistency of paste ; then put 



SIDE DISHES AND SALADS. 113 

in your refrigerator until it cools; mould into oval patties 
or any shape you like. Dip them into the yolks of three 
eggs seasoned well, and then roll in beaten crackers or 
bread-crumbs; then put them in boiling lard; it is very 
important that the lard should be boiling, before the cro- 
quettes are put in. Two sweetbreads added to this receipt 
will make two dozen croquettes. 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Take nice size smooth Irish potatoes, and put in the oven 
let them bake slowly until well done, then remove all the inside 
very carefully so as not to break the skin. Mash the potatoes 
through the potato strainer ; beat up one egg, yellow and white 
separately, a cup of rich milk in a pan on the fire ; stir pota- 
toes in the milk, then the egg (yellow first, then the white), 
butter and salt. Put this mixture into their jackets, taking 
care not to have it too thin, and place in oven for a few 
moments until brown. This is for six or eight potatoes. 
Nice lunch or breakfast dish. 

FILLING FOR PATTIES. 

Breast of one chicken chopped fine, one pair of sweetbreads 
parboiled and then cooked a short time in soup stock, one can 
mushrooms cooked in soup stock. Chop mushrooms and 
sweetbreads, but not too fine ; season with salt. Make a sauce 
of soup stock, drawn butter and cream, and mix thoroughly. 



ICES. 



ORANGE WATER ICE. 

Eight oranges, three lemons, three pounds loaf sugar, one 
box gelatine dissolved in cold water, enough to make one and 
a half gallons. Extract the oil of both oranges and lemons 
by rubbing the rind with lumps of sugar. Freeze as usual. 
Pour boiling water over the gelatine after it lias stood in 
cold water half an hour. 

CARAMEL ICE CREAM. 

One small half teacup of white sugar in a pan, and stir 
over the fire until the sugar turns liquid and begins to smoke. 
Turn it at once into one quart of custard : stir rapidly. When 
cool, add one quart rich cream, strain and freeze. 

ORANGE ICE CREAM. 

Boil two quarts of milk. Stir in it while boiling one 
tablespoonful of corn starch mixed with a little cold milk, 
and the yolks of three eggs beaten light. Stir it briskly 
to prevent its curdling. When perfectly cold add one and 
a half pints of cream and the juice of six oranges. Sweeten 
to taste. Beat very light the whites of three eggs and 
stir them in just before freezing. 

PARKER'S ICE CREAM. 

One quart new milk, one vanilla bean, one tablespoonful of 
corn starch or flour; boil all together. When cold add one 
quart cream, three-quarters pound of sugar, beat the whites 
of six eggs to a froth and stir them in. 

115 



116 ICES. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM. 

Scrape quarter pound of chocolate very fine, put it in a quart 
of rich milk or cream. Boil it until it is dissolved, stirring 
occasionally. Thicken with one egg. A vanilla bean boiled 
with the milk improves the flavor. When cream is used the 
egg may be dispensed with. Freeze in the usual way. 

GRAPE SHERBET. 

Take half gallon grape juice, sweeten to taste, then add two 
teacups of sugar to three teacups of orange juice, half teacup 
of lemon juice ; then add this to the grape juice, and when 
ready to remove the dasher from the freezer, add the whites 
of three eggs well beaten with two tablespoons of sugar. Beat 
and pack to stand in ice and salt until hard. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. 

Grate half a pound Baker's chocolate very fine. Mix it into 
a smooth paste with a little fresh milk. Take three pints of 
morning's milk, put it on the fire to boil, then stir in the 
chocolate paste. Have ready the yolks of six eggs well beaten 
with one pound of white sugar. Pour the chocolate over this, 
boiling hot from the kettle, and put it all back on the fire 
stirring all the time till it thickens. Great care is needful as 
it is very apt to burn. When the chocolate custard is cold 
whip up five pints of cream and stir it in. Season slightly 
with vanilla. Now beat the whites of five eggs to a stiff froth, 
adding gradually while beating two tablespoonsful of pulverized 
sugar, and as soon as they are well mixed and the cream about 
half frozen, put it into the freezer, and you will find this 
addition a great improvement. 

FROZEN PUDDING. 

To three pints of new milk put three or four sticks of fresh 
cinnamon, two blades of mace, one and a quarter pounds of the 
best raisins, stemmed and stoned. Cover these tightly in the 



ICES. 117 

stew-pan and simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. Meanwhile 
beat very light the yolks of five eggs, adding slowly when 
light half a pound of pulverized loaf sugar. Make it as light 
and creamy as possible. When ready strain the milk so as to 
leave out the spice and raisins, but save the latter as they are 
to be put in after a while. Stir in the eggs and sugar when 
the milk boils, beating it until it simmers once. Then remove 
it from the fire, and when cold stir in one quarter pound of 
almonds that have been blanched, and pounded in a mortar 
with a little rose-water, then the raisins that were boiled in 
the milk, half a pound of the best citron cut into small very 
thin slices, and if preferred, a small portion of preserved ginger 
cut thin. Mix all well together, add a quart of rich cream, 
stir till nicely mixed and freeze as ice cream. A " Turk's 
Head " makes a very pretty mould for it. 

TUTTI FRUTTI. 

When a rich vanilla cream is partly frozen add candied 
cherries, English currants, chopped raisins, chopped citron or 
any other candied fruit chopped rather fine in about the same 
quantity of fruit as of ice cream. Mould it, and imbed it in 

ice and salt. 

ORANGE ICE. 

To four quarts water take five oranges and three lemons. 
Grate the rind of the oranges clean on lumps of sugar, but 
only use the juice of the lemons. Squeeze the pulps of the 
oranges and lemons, and put boiling water to them, then let it 
stand until the water is cold. Strain the water off, put about 
two pounds of sugar to this quantity in addition to the lumps 
of sugar used. Freeze as usual. 

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 

Take half a gallon of rich cream perfectly sweet. Sweeten 
to taste ; then take half a gallon nice ripe strawberries, mash 
them well in a marble mortar, with half a pound fine white 



118 ICES. 

sugar, or more if the berries are sour. Then mix the mashed 
berries into the cream and freeze hard. Raspberry and peach 
cream is made in the same manner. 

LEMON ICE CREAM. 

Take lumps of sugar and rub off the rind of six lemons on 
it. To one gallon of cream add the juice of two large lemons 
and two pounds loaf sugar. Put as much sugar to the juice 
as it will take. Then put the juice with the sugar, and the 
lumps on which the rind has been grated, to one gallon cream, 

and freeze hard. 

PINEAPPLE ICE. 

Grate three large pineapples very fine, add three quarts water, 
two and a half pounds white sugar, whites of six eggs beaten 
stiff with the sugar. Add this last and freeze hard. This is 

exceedingly nice. 

LEMON SHERBET. 

Make a rich lemonade, using two lemons to one pint water. 
Rub some of the rind with loaf sugar, so as to extract the oil, 
say about four lemons to a gallon. Take the whites of eight 
eggs beat to an icing, adding pulverized sugar; about two 
pounds sugar to a gallon, including the icing, is about the 
quantity, but it depends upon the size of the lemons and the 
amount of juice they have. A quarter of an ounce of Cox's 
gelatine dissolved and added is a great improvement. 

FROZEN CUSTARD. 

One quart milk, four eggs, two even tablespoonsful corn 
starch, and one cup sugar. Beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth with half a cup powdered sugar, and stir them in 
when the custard is cold just before freezing. Flavor with 
vanilla. 

ICE CREAM. 

To three quarts rich milk put two ounces isinglass. Boil all 
together, and strain before flavoring it. Any kind of seasoning. 



ICES. 119 

PLOMBIERE. 

Make a rich custard. When cold flavor it with wine and 
lemon. When it is half frozen add blanched almonds, chopped 
citron, brandy peaches cut up, and any other brandied or crys- 
tallized fruit. Fill the freezer half full of custard, and the re- 
maining half fill with the fruit. Raisins are an improvement. 

PEACH ICE CREAM. 

Take perfectly ripe free-stone peaches. Pare them and mash 
them fine. Make them very sweet. To each quart of peaches 
add one quart rich cream or new milk. Mix well and freeze. 
Take one ounce Cox's gelatine melted in a cup of water. Boil 
the milk and pour it on the gelatine, and when cold mix with 
the peaches. 

ICED JELLY. 

Make calf's foot jelly, not very stiff, and freeze it. It is 
delicious. Serve in glasses. 

CARAMEL CREAM. 

Make a rich custard with one pint of morning's milk and 
six eggs. Have ready one and a quarter pounds brown sugar 
toasted (be careful not to burn it). Stir the sugar into the 
custard while both are hot. This will flavor one gallon of 
ice cream. 

ALMOND CREAM. 

Blanch and pulverize one quart of almonds ; this should be 
done in a mortar, and a little new milk added to reduce the nuts 
to a fine paste. Use this with one gallon of cream, mixing the 
almonds in when the cream is nearly frozen. 

PLAIN ICE CREAM. 

Two quarts thick cream, one pound sugar, one pint new 
milk into which cut a vanilla bean. Put it on the fire, allow- 
ing the milk and bean to boil slowly, strain it through a wire 
sieve, permitting the small seeds of the bean to fall into the 



120 ICES. 

cream. When it becomes cool whip all to a froth and freeze, 
cutting it down frequently as it freezes. 

BISQUE GLACE. 

Half a gallon of cream, one and a half dozen macaroons 
(these must be stale, or if not, dried in a stove), pounded fine. 
Pour a little cream over them and allow them to stand till they 
soften ; beat until very fine, then add the rest of the cream and 
freeze. It is not well to have the macaroons too thick in the 
cream. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. 

One quart of cream, one pint of new milk, two cups sugar, 
two eggs beaten light, and five tablespoonsful of Baker's choco- 
late rubbed to a paste with a little milk. Heat the milk almost 
to boiling, and pour by degrees in with the beaten egg and 
sugar. Stir in the chocolate, beat well three minutes, and 
return it to the inner kettle. (Always boil milk and custard 
in a vessel set within another of boiling water.) Heat until it 
thickens well, stirring constantly, then take from the fire and 
set aside to cool. Many like to flavor with vanilla. When 
the custard is cold beat in the cream. Freeze as usual. 

COFFEE ICE CREAM. 

Three pints cream, one cup black coffee very strong and 
clear, two cups sugar, and two tablespoonsful of arrowroot wet 
with cold milk. Heat a pint and a half of the cream nearly 
to boiling, stir in the sugar, and, when this is melted, the 
coffee, then the arrowroot. Boil all together for five minutes, 
stirring constantly. When cold beat it up very light, whipping 
in the rest of the cream by degrees. Then freeze. 

STRAWBERRY ACID. 

Dissolve four ounces of citric acid, in one-half gallon of 
water, pour it over two gallons of ripe strawberries, let it stand 
twenty-four hours and then drain. To every pint of juice add 



ICES. 121 

a pound of white sugar. Let it boil well for five minutes then 
let it stand three days before bottling. When ready to serve, 
add two tablespoonsful to a glass of ice water. 

STRAWBERRY WATER ICE. 

To one quart of strawberries, add one pound of sugar and 
juice of two lemons, mash them and stand aside one hour, 
then strain through a fine sieve ; add one quart of water and 
freeze. This is enough for eight persons. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

To one quart of lemon water ice frozen hard, add slowly 
one-half pint of champagne, one-half pint Jamaica rum, one 
gill maraschino, one teaspoonful of vanilla ; beat well. Put 
in freezer, pack and cover well, and stand away for four or 
five hours. Serve in glasses. 

FROZEN PUNCH. 

The juice of six lemons and two oranges, one-half pint of 
champagne, one gill of rum, one-half gill of brandy, one 
pound of pulverized sugar ; stir until sugar is dissolved ; add 
one pint of water. Put in freezer and turn slowly until mix- 
ture is partly frozen. Remove the dasher, cover and stand 
away for two hours. It will require a long time to freeze. 
This will fill twelve glasses. 

APPLE ICE CREAM. 

To half a gallon of coddled apples, add one pound of white 
sugar and half gallon of sweet cream ; stir well and have it 
frozen hard. This is a delicious dish.

time until it looks clear. Strain it through a flannel bag 
inside a muslin one. If not clear, pass it through a second 
time. This will keep in cold weather for weeks. 

CALF'S FOOT JELLY. 

Take two feet and boil them in a gallon of water till it 
comes to a quart. When it is cold skim off the fat, take up 
the jelly clean, and put it in a saucepan with a pint of white

124 DESSERTS. 



CALF'S OR PIG'S FEET JELLY. 

Thoroughly cleanse and scrape the feet, and covering them 
well with pure water, boil until thoroughly done. Set the 
stock aside in a cold place to solidify. The next day care- 
fully skim off the grease from the surface and measure the 
stock. To one gallon of stock put three pounds of sugar, half 
a gallon good bright-colored wine, the juice, and thinly sliced 
rind of six lemons, and the beaten whites of sixteen eggs. Stir 
all together over the fire until well mixed, and boil twenty 
minutes. Strain through a flannel bag as usual. This jelly 
will keep for many weeks. Add stick cinnamon, one ounce 
mace, one dozen cloves, one dozen allspice. 

CREAM JELLY. 

To one quart of the stock made from pigs 7 feet put one pint 
of sweet cream, one pint of fresh milk, and ten ounces of pul- 
verized sugar. Flavor with extract of rose or vanilla. Melt 
together in a pan over the fire, strain and impart a pale pink 
tint, by the use of a little cochineal or pokeberry jelly. Mould 
it precisely as you do blanc mange. When firm, turn out the 
jelly into the centre of a shallow dessert dish of glass or china. 
Surround it with syllabub whipped to a light froth, and you 
have a very pretty and palatable dish. 

LEMON JELLY. 

One and three-quarter ounces of Russian isinglass, three 
and three quarter pounds of loaf sugar, and three lemons. 
Cut the isinglass into small pieces, turn over it one quart of 
cold water, and let it stand half an hour, then pour off the 
water. Put the isinglass into a pitcher with the juice of two 
lemons, and one cut in slices. Put in the sugar and a 
dessertspoonful of rose water. Over all pour three pints 
of boiling water, cover it and let it stand an hour or so 



DESSERTS. 125 

until the isinglass is dissolved. Strain through a jelly bag 
into moulds, and set it in a cool place. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Soak a box of gelatine in one pint of cold water. When 
thoroughly soft add five ounces of white sugar, two quarts of 
strawberry syrup, and put it over the fire until the gelatine 
is perfectly dissolved. Pour it from the kettle into moulds or 
small jars, and you have a beautiful and nice flavored jelly. 
This recipe is meant for cool weather. In summer reduce 
the quantity of syrup by one-half. 

SYLLABUB. 

Syllabub gives a very nice finish to many desserts, and when 
called for it should be made in this manner : To half a pint 
of rich cream add half a gill of sweet wine, and two table- 
spoonsful of finely powdered white sugar, and flavor it with 
lemon juice. Whip it to a froth, removing lightly with a 
spoon all the foam as it forms, and putting it to the dish 
requiring to be ornamented. 

TO MAKE JELLY WITHOUT BOILING. 

To one package of Cox's sparkling gelatine add one pint 
cold water, the juice of three lemons, and the rind pared thin. 
Let it stand one hour, then add three pints of boiling water, 
half a pint of wine, one and a half pounds of crushed sugar. 
When the sugar is dissolved strain the lemon rind out and set 
it away to cool.

whicll may be warm at first, not hot. Put the pan in a rather 
cool oven, and gradually increase to a moderate heat. In 
about twenty minutes dip a teaspoon into one of the custards 
to ascertain if it is firm. Judgment and great care are needed 
to attain skill in baking custard, for if left in the oven a 
minute too long, or if the fire is too hot, the milk will certainly 
whey. 

BURNED CUSTARD.

until perfectly light the whites of six eggs. To each egg allow 
Okie tablespoonful of pulverized sugar, which add gradually,

water. To this put one pint of new milk and the yolks of 
three eggs. Put the chocolate into the milk and boil a few 
minutes. Sweeten with quarter of a pound of sugar, and then 
pour it, boiling hot, over the eggs which have been previously 
beaten till light. Return all to the kettle and stir well until 
it thickens or is upon the point of boiling, when it must 
instantly be poured off and set to cool. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

One quart cream, half a box of gelatine, one cup of milk, 
half a pound fine sugar. Pour on the gelatine half a pint of 
cold water, let it soak, then dissolve it over the fire, mixing it

spice. It may be baked in crust or cups. This is an 
excellent recipe. Vanilla is better than spice. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Dissolve as much gelatine as one of Cox's packets contains 
the size marked one shilling in half a pint new milk. The 
milk should be poured cold over the gelatine, left to stand 
about half an hour, and then set over the fire in a stew-pan. 
Stir it steadily until the gelatine is thoroughly melted. Then 
set it aside. Beat up the yolks of four eggs, to which add ten 
ounces pulverized sugar. Add these to the dissolved gelatine 
and milk, which then return to fire, and stir rapidly till it 
thickens. Then pour into a china bowl, and having provided 
two quarts of rich cream, whip up and add to the custard all 
the foam that rises till the whole quantity is used. Pour the 
congealing cream into moulds lined with sponge cake, or lady- 
fingers, and the charlotte russe is made. To have this dish in 
perfection the mould should be set in a tub, and finely pounded 
ice or snow, and salt packed closely around, so that the cream 
may freeze. Only use fresh cream, and serve in twenty-four 
hours. 

MANIOCA CREAM. 

Six tablespoon sful of manioca, six well beaten eggs, one 
quart milk, one cup sugar ; flavor to taste. Soak manioca in

wineglasses of clear water. Let it stand until it dissolves. 
Then boil it until perfectly clear. Beat well the whites of 
four eggs. Pour the sugar into the dish with the eggs, but 
do not mix them until the syrup is lukewarm, then beat all

together for one hour. Season to your taste with vanilla, rose 
water, or lemon juice. The first coating may be put on the 
cake as soon Wit is well mixed. Rub the cake with a little 
flour before you apply the icing. While the first coating is 
drying continue to beat the remainder. You will not have to 
wait long if the cake is set in a warm place near the fire. 
This is considered an excellent recipe for icing. 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Put two ounces of Walter Baker's chocolate into a shallow 
pan, and place it where it will melt gradually but not scorch. 
When melted stir in three tablespoons of milk or cream and 
one of water. Mix all well together, and add one scant tea- 
cupful of sugar. Boil about five minutes, and while hot, and 
when the cakes are nearly cold, spread some evenly over the 
surface of one of them. Put a second one on top, and so on 
alternating cake and icing. Then cover the top and sides, and 
set in a warm oven to harden. This icing does not stick to 
the fingers, and in making chocolate Eclairs, those most pal- 
atable cakes, this recipe is very satisfactory. 

ICING. 

One teacup of pulverized sugar, moisten with water very 
slightly, and put it in the stove until dissolved ; do not let it 
boil. Pour this while hot into ine whites of two well-beaten 
eggs, and stir it till thoroughly mixed. Then flavor with vanilla 
or lemon. 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 

The whites of two eggs, four tablespoonsful of Walter 
Baker's chocolate, one and a quarter cups sugar. Flavor with 
vanilla. 

COMMON GINGERBREAD. 

Two and a half pounds flour, half pound butter, two 
tablespoonsful ginger and one teaspoonful soda, dissolved in 
water. This is excellent for children. 



198 CAKES. 

COOKIES. 

Five cups flour, three of sugar, one of butter, one egg, half 
a teacup of milk, half a teaspoon of soda, one lemon. 

DROP GINGER CAKES. 

Four eggs, one quart flour, one cup lard, one cup sugar, one 
cup sour cream, one tablespoon soda, dissolved in a little 
vinegar, one tablespoonful ginger, one of cinnamon, one pint 
molasses. Drop a tablespoonful of the mixture at a time 
into a greased pan and bake. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

Thirteen eggs, one and a half pounds pulverized sugar, 
three-quarters pound flour, and the juice and rind of two 
lemons. In making sponge cake first beat the whites and yolks 
separately, very light, then to the yolks add the sugar, mixing 
thoroughly. To this add the whites. Beat all together, then 
cut in the flour with a knife. Last of all add the lemon. A 
great improvement to sponge cake is after greasing the pans to 
drop a piece of butter the size of a small nutmeg in each pan. 

CRULLERS. 

Four eggs beaten separately, one pound pulverized sugar, 
one teacup of sour cream, one teaspoonful soda, a lump of 
butter the size of an egg, and flour enough to roll them out. 
Fry in plenty of hot lard. 

LIGHT GINGERBREAD. 

Two pounds flour, one pound butter, one pound sugar, one 
pint molasses, six eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, one wineglass 
of rose water, and three tablespoonsful of ginger. 

QUICK DOUGHNUTS. 

One cup butter, two cups sugar, four eggs, one cup sour 
milk or cream, one teaspoonful soda, one of nutmeg, half a 



CAKES. 199 

teaspoonful of cinnamon, and flour enough to roll in plenty 
soft dough. Fry in hot lard. Royal Baking Powder can be 
used instead of soda or cream of tartar. 

ORANGE CAKE. 

Six eggs, one pound flour, one pound sugar, half pound 
butter, one teacup of sweet or sour cream. Take six oranges, 
grate the peel, leaving out that of three. Then cut off all the 
white skin, and be careful not to let any seeds get in or the 
cake will be bitter. Use the peel with layers of oranges, 
alternately with icing, between the layers of cake, and bake in 
jelly cake tins. 

SUGAR CAKE. 

Three pints flour, nine eggs, one and a half pounds sugar, 
three-quarters pound butter, one teaspoon soda, half teacup 
sour cream. Leave out the yolks of four eggs. 

NUT CAKE. 

Eight eggs (whites only), one-half pound butter, one-half 
pint milk, one pound sugar, one pound flour, one teaspoon 
Royal Baking Powder, one teaspoon extract almond. Cream 
your butter and sugar, add milk and flour and seasoning. 
Beat eggs very light and add last. Bake in jelly pans. This 
will make two of three layers each. Icing : Make a boiled 
icing of three cups of sugar and one gill of water. Let it 
boil until it will harden in water. Beat the whites of two 
eggs very light and pour the syrup over them, beating all the 
time. Season with teaspoonful of extract of**anilla. Add 
one cup of stoned raisins and one of English walnuts. Put 
this between the layers and on top. This quantity is enough 
for about one. I generally break the nuts into about four. 

A DELICIOUS CAKE. 

Make a white cup cake as follows, and bake in tins as for 
jelly cake : Flour one and a quarter pints, granulated sugar 



200 CAKES. 

three-quarters of a pint, whites of six eggs, butter one-quarter 
pint, whiskey one tablespoonful. This is enough for three 
layers. Now make an icing, as follows : Sugar one pound, 
boiled with one teacup of water till it flies off the spoon in 
strings. It takes from eight to ten minutes boiling, but the 
length of time can best be determined by experience, and it 
must not be stirred more than possible. If it shows a ten- 
dency to turn to sugar put in the white of an egg and beat it. 
When this is sufficiently boiled pour it over the whites of four 
eggs which have been beaten to a stiff froth, beat hard till it 
whitens, then add the following ingredients which have been 
previously prepared : One-quarter pound citron cut in shreds, 
one-quarter pound figs, cut in shreds, one-half pound raisins, 
one pound blanched almonds cut in half. Mix these all to- 
gether and add gradually to the icing ; beat very hard till it 
begins to stiffen, and spread between and on the sides of the 
cakes. Conserved fruits may be added to this icing and are 
very nice. 

In all receipts in which chocolate is to be used I recom- 
mend Walter Baker & Co.'s as the purest and most reliable, 
'and this I know from actual test.

PRESERVES. 



QUINCE JELLY AND MARMALADE. 

Take one peck of quinces and wash them. To this add 
three quarts of water, and boil it until the fruit is soft, then 
put them into a cullender and let the liquid drain through. 
Strain it through a flannel ; add one pound sugar to one pint of 
liquid, and boil it until it jellies. Sift what is left in the cullen- 
der through it. Then to two quart bowls of quince put three 
pints of sugar; stir it well ; put it over the fire and stir it twenty 
minutes. Then put it into bowls and cover with paper. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Choose fine large quinces, pare, core and quarter them. 
Cut out carefully any defective parts ; put them in a preserv- 
ing kettle with as much water as will cover them, and let 
them scald till they become soft, but do not let them break. 
Then take them out, lay them on a dish, and allow one 
pound loaf sugar to each pound of fruit. To each pound 
of the sugar add half a pint of the water the quinces were 
boiled in. Then put it on the fire, and boil and skim it till 
perfectly clear. Then put in the fruit; let it cook until 
it appears clear and of an amber color, then take it out, put it 
in jars, and pour the syrup over while warm. When cold 
cover with paper soaked in brandy, and tie it or paste it tight 
over the jars. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Peel the oranges, and cut the peel into thin slices, then throw 
them into cold water. Boil them until tender. Take all the 
rind and tough skin from the oranges. Make a syrup, allqw- 

201 



202 PRESERVES. 

ing one pound of sugar to a pint of water, and a pound of 
oranges mixed with the peel. Boil all together for two hours, 
or until done. Put it into moulds. When cold it is ready 
for use. 

GREEN TOMATO PRESERVE. 

One peck of green tomatoes. After paring them slice them. 
Cut up six lemons, take out the seed, add six pounds of sugar, 
and boil until done. Green ginger is an improvement. 

MELON MARMALADE. 

Pare and weigh the watermelon rinds, and lay them in 
strong brine for a week ; soak in water until fresh enough, 
and then boil in water till they are tender. Take half a pound 
white sugar to one pound of the rind ; let it boil till it begins 
to thicken. Add one box of dissolved gelatine to twelve 
pounds of marmalade. Stir it frequently, and let it boil until 
you can slice it. When cold flavor with lemon. 

BRANDY PEACHES. 

Take fresh, ripe, clingstone peaches, pour boiling lye over 
them, and rub off the down with a coarse cloth. Make a 
syrup of half a pound of sugar to each pound of peaches. 
Boil and skim the syrup, put in the peaches, and let them boil 
fifteen minutes ; take them out of the syrup and cool them on 
a dish. Boil the syrup again to one-half, and let it cool. 
When cool add an equal quantity of French, apple, or peach 
brandy, and stir it well. When the peaches have cooled put 
them in a jar and pour on the syrup. Close the jar tight. 

GREEN CITRON PRESERVE. 

Pare the citron, and cut it into small or fancy pieces ; take 
out the seed and use the pulp and rind. To twelve pounds 
fruit add one pound green ginger, four lemons, sliced thin, and 
with the seeds taken out. To each pound of fruit use one and 
a quarter pounds sugar, and one pint water. Boil it three or 



PRESERVES. 203 

four hours. Do not pot the lemon in till the citron is nearly 
ready to take up. Put the ginger in the sugar and make the 
syrup. Let the rind lie in cold water all night. 

WATERMELON RIND PRESERVE. 

Cut the rind into various shapes, and put it into salt and 
water for one night. Boil it in clear water three times ; in 
the second water throw a piece of alum. Keep the rind closely 
covered with leaves while boiling, and after each " boil " throw 
it immediately out of the boiling water into clear cold water, in 
which let it remain until it gets cool. When it can be pierced 
with a straw it is sufficiently done. Have a syrup prepared of 
one and a quarter pounds of sugar, to each pound of rind. 
After draining the water from the rind through a cullender, 
throw it into the syrup with lemon peel cut into strips, or, if 
preferred, green ginger. Let it boil slowly until quite 

transparent. 

WATERMELON RIND JAM. 

Pare the rind and lay it in cold water for an hour or two, 
then put it in fresh cold water, and let it come to a boil. Put 
it in cold ginger tea and let it remain all night. Then put it 
in fresh ginger tea, made with the same giuger, and boil it till 
you can pass a straw through it. Drain it through a cullender; 
weigh the rind and chop it fine. Allow three-quarters pound 
sugar to a pound of the rind, and boil it clear. One lemon 
will season two pounds of rind, half pound ginger will season 
six pounds rind. Divide the ginger and make fresh tea, 
instead of using the other. 

PRESERVED APPLES. 

Apples for winter use should be preserved in November, 
and they will keep until June. Take firm pippins, pare and 
core them carefully, leaving them whole. Drop them in cold 
water as fast as pared to prevent their turning dark. Make a 
syrup of one pound of white sugar, and half a pint water to 



204 ' PRESERVES. 

each pound of apples ; clarify and skim it well. Wipe the 
apples, and put as many in the skillet as will go without one 
being on top of another. Let them boil quickly till they look 
clear, then take them up carefully and lay them on dishes, and 
put others in the same syrup. When all are done if the 
syrup should seem too thin, boil it up after the apples are all 
taken out. Cut the peel of several lemons in thin rings, boil 
them till soft, then throw them in the syrup. If you only want 
the apples to keep a few weeks, they may be preserved with 

half pound sugar. 

GRAPE JAM. 

One peck fox grapes, quarter peck good apples (cooking 
apples), seven pounds sugar. Pour a little water to the 
grapes, then set them over the fire and let them come to, a boil. 
Then strain them through a cullender. Stew the apples and 
add them with the sugar to the grape juice. Cook until stiff. 

RASPBERRY PRESERVE. 

To every pound of fruit allow one pound of white sugar 
pounded, and let it boil twenty minutes without stirring it. 
When done, put it into small glasses as directed for straw- 
berries, and set it in the sun for some time. 

PLUM JELLY. 

Take sound ripe plums (if damsons^ an incision must be 
made in them), put them in a stone jar, cover it with bladder, 
and place it in a deep pan of water over the fire. Let the 
water boil gently till all the juice has come from the fruit. 
Strain through a jelly bag, and boil with an equal weight of 
loaf sugar, stirring all the time. This should cook for about 
twenty minutes. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Select apples that are rather tart and highly flavored ; cut 
and core them without paring. Place them in a porcelain 
preserving kettle, cover them with water, and let them cook 



PRESERVES. 205 

slowly till the apples look red. Pour into a cullender, drain 
off the juice and let this run through a jelly bag, then return 
it to the kettle, which must be carefully washed, and boil it 
half an hour. Then measure it, and allow half a pound of 
sugar to every pint of juice, and boil quickly for fifteen 
minutes. The juice of apples boiled in shallow vessels, without 
a particle of sugar, makes the most sparkling, delicious jelly 
imaginable. Red apples will give a jelly the color and clear- 
ness of claret, while that from light fruit is like amber. Take 
the cider just as it is made, not allowing it to ferment at all, 
and, if possible, boil it in a very large flat and shallow pan. 

HODGE-PODGE. 

To each pound of fruit put three-quarters pound of Havana 
sugar, or half a pound loaf sugar. Do not pare any of the 
fruit except peaches. The fruit must be cut as thin as possible 
in slices. Peaches, pears, apples, or quinces, and half ripe 
cantaloupe can be used. Mix all well together, and let it 
stand twelve or fourteen hours, or till it floats in juice, then 
put it in the skillet and let it boil until it looks clear. It 
takes double the time to boil that any other preserve does. 
Add ginger and lemon peel. 

PRESERVED FIGS. 

Scrape out the insides and boil them in clear water till you 
can run a straw through them. The water must be changed 
two or three times. When they are sufficiently boiled lay 
them on a coarse cloth to dry. Make a syrup of an equal 
quantity of sugar with the fruit, and boil them in it, some 
time, putting in some ginger. In two weeks boil them again. 

CANTALOUPE PRESERVE. 

Cut a green cantaloupe into any shape you choose, pare off 
the outside rind, and take out the soft inside. Let the rind 
stand an hour in cold water. To the rind put a lump of alum 



206 PRESERVES. 

the size of a nutmeg, and place grape leaves in the bottom of 
the skillet, and put in the rind and alum, with as much water 
as will cover them. Put on more leaves, and let them boil 
slowly till you can run a straw through them, then take them 
out and lay them on a dish. When cold put the rind in strong 
ginger tea, and let them stand one night. Make a syrup of 
ginger tea. To each pound of rind allow one pound of sugar, 
and boil all together as you do watermelon rind. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

Take one pound sugar, sprinkle it over one pound of straw- 
berries, let it stand a short time to make a syrup. Add to 
each pound one gill of currant juice, or a few drops of lemon. 
Very little time will boil them. Let them cool in a dish 
before putting them in jars. 

PRESERVED PINEAPPLE. 

Cut the fruit in slices and lay it in a dish ; strew fine sugar 
over it to make a syrup. When sufficient juice has been ex- 
tracted let it boil till clear and tender. Allow one pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Gather the currants when just ripe. Pick them carefully 
from the stem ; press them thoroughly with the hands, and 
strain (without squeezing) through a flannel bag. One pound 
sugar to one pint juice. Put the juice into the kettle, and let 
it come almost to a boil ; skim several times, and then put in 
the sugar. Boil rapidly a few minutes. This makes the 
fairest jelly, but the quantity is not so great as when the cur- 
^rants are heated before straining. 

CRAB APPLE JELLY. 

Put them in a kettle and cover them with water. Let them 
boil till they burst, then strain them through a flannel bag. 



PRESERVES. 207 

To every pint of juice put one pound sugar. Boil hard for 
fifteen minutes. Skim well. When done put into glasses 
before it cools. 

CURRANT JELLY. No. i. 

Strip the currants from the stalk, then put them in a kettle 
and cook them until the juice is extracted, then boil the juice 
twenty minutes. Add one pound sugar (heat the sugar in a pan 
before adding it) to one pint of juice, and boil it five minutes 
longer. When done, if it is not perfectly clear, strain it while 
hot through a piece of muslin, and put it into glasses. It is just 
as well not to let it boil any more after the sugar has been 
added, but to let it stand and thoroughly dissolve. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Ten pounds of currants make seven pounds of jelly. Put 
in a preserving kettle, add to that quantity one and one-half 
pints of water. Boil them well down. Strain through a 
flannel bag. To one pint of juice, add one pound of white 
sugar. Put the juice in the kettle. When it comes to a boil, 
stir in the sugar slowly, until it boils ; then remove from the 
fire, pour into jars or glasses. Let it remain open a while, 
before sealing. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

Wash the berries, and put them into a kettle with some 
water to cook them. When they soften let them boil hard 
twenty minutes, and set them away in the kettle overnight. 
Then squeeze them through a cloth, and allow one pound 
sugar to one pint of juice. Let the juice heat up, add the 
sugar gradually, and let it stand until dissolved, but do not 
.let it boil. * 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Choose large, fully-ripe blackberries, weigh them, and allow 
three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Mash 
sugar and fruit together. Put the whole into a preserving 



208 PRESERVES. 

kettle. Skim it while boiling, and stir it frequently. Let it 
boil until it thickens. When done put it in small pots or 
glasses, and when cold cover with brandy paper, and paste 
or tie them close. Any kind of fruit may be made into jam 
by following these directions. Peaches are nicer (small ones) 
with the skin on. 

CHOPPED APPLE PRESERVE. 

Take equal quantities of granulated sugar and apples. To 
every three pounds sugar put one pint water. Boil in a thick 
syrup with one ounce of race ginger. Chop the apples in 
pieces half an inch square. Boil them in the syrup until clear. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

To every pound of fruit put one pound of pulverized loaf 
sugar. When they are half done drop in a small piece of 
alum the size of a filbert to every five pounds. 

GREEN TOMATO JAM. 

Sixteen pounds of green tomatoes, ten large lemons, ten 
pounds of sugar. Pare the tomatoes, and add three-quarters 
of a pound of green ginger. 

PEACH CAKES. 

Take dry soft peaches and peel them. Then spread them 
on dishes, and mash them till they are reduced to a pulp, but 
do not mash until the juice comes out. Weigh them before 
mashing, and allow a quarter pound white sugar to one pound 
of fruit. Mix the sugar and peaches, and spread it out on 
plates or dishes to dry. When they are dry enough to 
handle make them into cakes about the size and thickness of 
water crackers. Put them back on the dishes, and turn them 
over every morning. When dry pack them in sugar. 



PRESERVES. 209 

HOME-MADE RAISINS. 

Gather the grapes when ripe ; after washing them on the 
bunches pick them off. Make a thick syrup of two pounds 
of sugar and one pint of water. Drop the grapes into the 
kettle, and keep them in the syrup until they split open, when 
most of the side will settle in the kettle. Skim them out, and 
after drying them on plates pack them down in sugar. The 
same syrup can be used several times. These are very good in 

puddings or cake. 

CANDIED ORANGES. 

Choose fine sweet oranges; peel and quarter them. Make 
a syrup of one pound of sugar to a pint of water, and let it 
boil till it coaies to the candying point. Dip the oranges into 
this candied syrup, and place them on a sieve to drain. Put 
this sieve over a large flat dish that will catch the dripping 
syrup, and let the oranges remain so in a warm place until the 
candied syrup upon them is dry and crystallized. 

PEACH LEATHER. 

Take ripe peaches, cut them up, and cook them so they can 
be rubbed through a cullender. Then put them in a kettle 
with very little sugar, say about two pounds to a large kettle 
full. (I have made them best without any sugar at all as they 
dry better.) Cook them a little more, then spread them very 
thin on large tin waiters, such as are made with drying fruit. 
Place them in the hot sun. In four days they should be dry 
enough to take off. Cut them in thin strips, and roll up in 
shapes with white sugar. Apple, pear, or quince leather is 
made in the same way. 

CONSERVED PEACHES OR PEARS. 

Take nice ripe peaches or pears, and peel them. Have ready 

a syrup of one pound of sugar to four of fruit. Boil the fruit 

in the syrup about half an hour ; spread it on dishes and dry it 

in the hot sun. When dry roll them in sugar, and pack in jars.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING PICKLES. 



Pickles may be made at any time during the winter or 
summer provided that you have cucumbers, mangoes, or even 
peaches, which, having been gathered fresh during their season, 
were put in a strong brine, arid kept entirely under by the 
pressure of weights, so as not to be exposed to the air. When 
you take the vegetables or fruit out of the brine, soak them 
for a day or two in cold water. Then put them over the fire 
in a kettle, covering well with weak vinegar. Let them gently 
simmer until parboiled, or rather tender, but by all means do 
not let them cook till they become soft. Cucumbers are ruined 
by long cooking, which destroys their crispness, and almost 
renders them inedible. Let them remain in this vinegar until 
you are ready to supply the final seasoning and the strong 
cider vinegar needed for the preparation of all kinds of pickles. 
A delay of a week will do no harm, although the process may 
be completed forthwith if you prefer. The horseradish used 
in pickles must be scraped and dried ; the garlic must be 
soaked from three to ten days, changing the water once or 
twice a day ; the mustard seed bruised ; spices are put in 
without any preparation. When onions are used, they need 
only be sliced and 'scalded.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 



RAGOUT PICKLE. 

One gallon green tomatoes, sliced, one gallon chopped 
cabbage, one pint sliced onions, quarter pound mustard seed, 
one ounce celery seed, one ounce allspice, half ounce cloves, 
four tablespoonsful of whole black peppers, one and a half 
gills of salt, one pound brown sugar, three quarts vinegar. 
Boil all together one hour or until clear. It may be used in a 
week, and will keep a year. 

CHOPPED TOMATO PICKLE. 

Two gallons of tomatoes well chopped, five tablespoonsful 
of mustard, three gills mustard seed, two tablespoons of all- 
spice, two of ground pepper and two of cloves, one gill of salt, 
one and a half pints of onions chopped fine, two pounds of 
sugar, three quarts strong vinegar. Put all on the fire 
together, and boil until well done. The tomatoes should be 
green, and the skins pared off. This recipe applies equally to 
cabbage. 

DAMSON PICKLE. 

Two pounds damsons, one pound sugar, one pint vinegar. 
Add mace, cloves, and cinnamon. Stew the fruit and spice in 
vinegar until done. 

WALNUT PICKLE. 

Put the walnuts in salt and water, let them stand a fort- 
night ; then boil them. After taking them out of the brine 
put them in vinegar. Then put them in fresh vinegar, with 
any kind of spice you like. 
212 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 213 



GREEN TOMATO PICKLE. 

One peck green tomatoes cut in thin slices ; sprinkle them 
with salt, and let them stand two days. Twelve onions sliced, 
one-ounce bottle mustard, half pound white mustard seed, 
quarter ounce of turmeric, one dozen cloves, one ounce ground 
pepper, and one ounce allspice. Mix all together. Put in 
a kettle a layer of tomatoes, onions, and spices, alternately. 
Cover them with vinegar, and let them simmer an hour. 

GREEN TOMATOES PICKLED WITHOUT BOILING. 

One gallon of tomatoes sliced thin, six sliced onions. 
Sprinkle with salt, and let them remain overnight. Take 
them out and let them drain till evening. Add six moderate- 
sized green peppers, chopped fine, three tablespoonsful of 
ground mustard, half pint white mustard seed, one tablespoon- 
ful cloves, same of allspice and of black pepper, all mixed to- 
gether. Pack in a jar, cover with vinegar, and in one month 
it is fit for use. 

PICKLED DAMSONS. 

To every two pounds of damsons put one pound sugar, half 
a pint of vinegar, add mace, cloves, allspice, and cinnamon to 
taste. Place the fruit in ajar, then scald the vinegar, spices 
and sugar together, and pour it over the fruit for six successive 
mornings, covering the jar each time very closely, to prevent 
the flavor from escaping. This pickle is fit for use in two 
weeks. 

MARTYNIA PICKLE. 

Put the young pods in strong brine for a week or ten 
days, then take them out and wash them clean in fresh 
water. After this put them in vinegar to soak out the salt 
and weedy taste they would otherwise have. They should 
remain in this vinegar two weeks; then take them out and 
drain them well, then put them in a jar with the following 



214 PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

ingredients : One gallon vinegar, a large handful horseradish, 
one teacup allspice, half teacupful cloves, two pounds of brown 
sugar, four onions, and two pods of red pepper. The spice 
should be bruised in a mortar, and the onions and horseradish 
sliced. Boil "all these in vinegar, and pour it over the pre- 
pared martynias. 

PEACH MANGO. 

Lay the peaches in salt and water for two days, then take 
them out and wipe them dry. Take out the stones, and fill 
with the following mixture : Minced garlic, horseradish, 
bruised mustard seed, and sliced ginger root, celery seed, and 
onion. Tie the peaches round with thread, and strew over 
them cloves, broken cinnamon, and turmeric. Season cold 
vinegar with made mustard, ginger, and nutmeg and sugar. 
Pour the vinegar over the peaches, and set the jar in a cool 
place for three months. Oil may be added to this filling if 
desired. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

Peel the onions, and put them in salt and water not very 
strong for six days, changing the water every other day. 
Then boil some vinegar, putting in two handsful of salt. 
Let it stand until perfectly cold, and then pour over the 
onions. A tablespoonful of mustard to each quart is an 
improvement. 

YELLOW PICKLE. 

Gather firm, early York cabbages, cut them in half, cover 
them thickly with salt, and let them stand one night. Scald 
it next day, and spread it on a cloth to dry, turning it fre- 
quently. When well dried put it for one or two days in plain 
vinegar made very yellow with turmeric. When it is a good 
yellow, drain it, and put in spiced vinegar, cucumbers, and 
other vegetables, prepared as usual. To two gallons of 
vinegar, add three pounds of brown sugar, a handful of clove 
garlic, and a handful of horseradish cut in thin slices, one cup 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 215 

of white mustard seed, one cup of black pepper, two ounces of 
turmeric in a thin bag, half ounce of mace, a small quantity of 
celery seed, half a pound of white ginger soaked well, sliced, 
and dried ; one tablespoonful of the oil of cloves. Keep the 
jar in the sun covered up very close, and stir the pickle fre- 
quently. This will be ready for use in four or five months. 

YELLOW PICKLE. 

Take cabbage, cucumbers, peaches, and any other fruit or 
vegetable desired, and put them in salt or vinegar for two or 
three weeks, one pound of rare vinegar, half pound of garlic, 
four ounces of allspice, two ounces of long pepper, two ounces 
of turmeric, one pint of white mustard, and a handful of sliced

PICKLED WALNUTS. 

Take a peck of walnuts, tender enough to be easily punctured 
by a pin. Put them in a jar, and pour over them a very 
strong brine, boiling hot. In a fortnight they will have begun 
to brown considerably. They should then be taken out, 
drained, and laid in the sun until they turn black. Put them

pot, and tie it up close with a bladder or sheep skin, set it away 
three weeks, putting it by the fire, or, if warm weather, in the 
sun, stirring it up once every three days. Prepare the vege- 
tables by washing them in brine that will bear an egg, until 
they turn yellow. Put some of the brine they were washed in 
over the fire ; let it boil briskly, then throw in the pickles. 
Let them remain a few minutes, then take them out and put 
them in the sun to bleach. Have ready the jar with equal 
quantities of vinegar and water, a handful of salt, and half 
ounce of turmeric. Let the vegetables remain twenty-four 
hours in this, and then drain them out. Stuff the mangoes, 
and put them in pickle-pots. Put cabbages in the oven until 
the leaves fall, then tie them in bundles and put them in the 
jar for three days. Asparagus must be salted and dried three 
days in the sun. Cabbage can also be dried in the sun. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

In the month of September choose the small, white, round 
onions ; take off the brown skin. Have ready a clean tin 
stewpan of boiling water ; throw in as many onions as will 
cover the top. As soon as they look clear on the outside take 
them out as quickly as possible, and lay them on a clean cloth, 
covering them close with another. Then scald more, and so 
on till all are done. Let them remain till they are cold, then 
put them in a jar or wide-mouthed bottle, and pour over them 
the best white wine vinegar just hot. When cold cover 
them.

cold add more vinegar, a handful of fresh spices, onion, and 
two pounds brown sugar. 

WALNUT PICKLE. 

Gather walnuts about the 10th of June, when you can stick 
a pin through them. Lay them in salt water for two weeks, 
then take them out, scrape them, and rub them with a coarse 
towel. Then lay them in fresh water for three days, changing 
the water daily. Put garlic, allspice, and black pepper into 
vinegar, and pour it boiling on the walnuts. If they are 
rather old and hard, scald them in #n iron pot. Cloves are 
an improvement. 

PEPPER MANGOES.

them in fresh water till free from salt. Take a piece out, and 
fill with grated horseradish, white mustard seed, a little grated 
onion, and a few cloves of garlic, with ground cinnamon,

coifee cups of vinegar, eight tablespoons of sugar, the same of 
salt, one tablespoonful of cinnamon, one of allspice, one of 
nutmeg, and one of cloves. Boil all well together and seal 
while hot. This is superior to tomato catsup. 



CUCUMBER SWEET PICKLE. 

Slice the cucumbers about one inch thick, and boil for an 
hour in weak alum water, then take them out and lay them 
in cold water, leaving them until perfectly cold, then boil 
again in fresh alum water half an hour. Drain the fruit well, 
and make a syrup of one pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. To four pounds of fruit one pound cider vinegar. Boil 
the syrup, then put in the fruit, and let it boil until it is trans- 
parent. Add mace, and if the syrup is not thick enough 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 223 

continue to boil it after the fruit is removed. When cold 
sprinkle in some white mustard seed. 

RIPE CANTALOUPE MANGOES. 

Use ripe cantaloupes, small ones of course; pare them, cut 
a slit in each, and remove the seed carefully. Then put them 
into brine strong enough to bear an egg, and let them remain

ture: Three ounces crushed white ginger, three ounces of 
horseradish, scraped into shreds, six ounces black mustard 
seed, bruised, three quarters ounce mace, three quarters ounce 
cloves, one and a half ounces of whole black pepper, one and 
a half ounces turmeric, and three pounds of brown sugar, two 
and a quarter ounces cucumber out of brine, chopped small. 
Mix all together. When the mangoes have been filled put 
them into a jar and cover with boiling vinegar. The above 
quantity will fill about twenty-four small melons. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLE. 

Puncture the tomatoes with a fork ; place them on a dish 
and sprinkle them with salt. Let them remain two or three 
days, and then rinse off the salt in clear water. Put them in

pint vinegar. 

BETTER RECIPE FOR TOMATO CATSUP. 

Gather the tomatoes when quite ripe, cut them in thin slices, 
put a thick layer of tomatoes and a layer of salt alternately in 
a stone jar until full, then boil it gently half an hour. Rub 
it through a hair sieve, and to every gallon add four roots of 
horseradish scraped, a small onion stuck full of cloves, quarter 
ounce of mace, quarter ounce cloves, quarter ounce nutmeg, 
one ounce allspice, two pods red pepper, or one ounce black 
pepper. Boil all together, and when done add at the rate of

hours, then place them in a large bowl, and add the following : 
Quarter pound brown sugar, half a pint sweet oil, half a pound 
mustard seed, quarter pound ground black pepper, and two 
quarts of boiling vinegar. Mix all thoroughly, and put in 
small jars, filling up with cold vinegar, to cover the cucum- 
bers ; on the top of each jar put a little sweet oil, and seal up 
tight. ' 

WALNUT CATSUP. 

Pound the walnuts, and let them stand two or three days in 
hot sun, then pour enough vinegar over them to cover them, and 
boil it. Then strain out the pounded walnuts. Add pepper, 
cloves, salt, onions, and a little more vinegar; put it on again 
and boil it, adding whatever spice you prefer. After boiling 
strain out the spice, and bottle the catsup. Age improves it 
very much. 

COLD TOMATO CATSUP. 

Half a peck ripe tomatoes, half a gallon good vinegar, one 
teacup of salt, one cup of mustard seed ground fine, four red 
peppers, three tablespoonsful of black pepper, a handful of 
celery seed, and a cup of grated horseradish.

half pound allspice, one ounce cloves, six ounces mustard, 
twenty cloves of garlic and onions, two pounds brown sugar, 
and a handful of peach leaves. Boil three hours, stirring all 
the time. When cool strain through a coarse cloth and bottle

jar covered tight, so as to exclude all air. 

PEPPER SAUCE (Pickled). 

Half peck green tomatoes, one head cabbage, half dozen 
white onions, half dozen large green peppers. Chop them all 
very fine. Add quarter pound white mustard seed, half 
tablespoonful black pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, and one 
tablespoonful celery seed. Put all in a skillet and cover with 
the best vinegar. Simmer slowly three hours. Some allspice 
and cloves will improve it.

mustard, four tablespoonsful salt, two of ground black pepper, 
half of allspice, and four pods of red pepper. Simmer the 
ingredients three hours, strain through a sieve, add one quart 
of vinegar, simmer ten minutes longer. Then pour it into 
small bottles, cork it tightly, and keep it in a cool place. 

ANOTHER RECIPE. 

One peck tomatoes, half a dozen onions chopped fine, two 
tablespoons of allspice, two of cloves, two ounces celery seed, 
quarter pound salt or more if liked, one pound brown sugar, 
and one quart of strong vinegar. This is an excellent recipe, 
and the proportions are always approved. 

WALNUT CATSUP. 

Early in June take the walnuts, while soft enough to beat 
to a paste, and to every hundred thus prepared add two quarts 
or a gallon of vinegar and a handful of salt. Let the liquor 
stand eight days in a stone jar, stirring it frequently. Then 
strain it into a tin saucepan, boil it, and skim it well; adding 
to it ginger, horseradish, mustard seed, a few cloves of garlic, 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 227 

and a little black pepper. Let it boil up once, pour it into an 
earthen pan, and when cold bottle it, dividing the ingredients 
between each bottle. The white walnut is best suited for 
making catsup, but, as that is not found in all districts, the 
black may be used if gathered while tender enough for the 
rind of the nut to be pierced with a pin. This is an excellent 
condiment to fresh boiled fish. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Gather the tomatoes, put them into a skillet covered close 
until all the juice is drawn out, then wring them hard through 
a coarse cloth. Season them high with pepper and salt, and 
boil them well without skimming, adding a few grains of 
whole pepper, five or six large blades of mace, and the .same 
quantity of cloves. When cold add one third of good vinegar ; 
bottle and cork them well, keeping them in a cool place. 

CUCUMBER CATSUP.

seeds, black pepper, and a little sugar. Pour over the cucum- 
bers. When cold it is ready for use. 

TOMATO CATSUP.

boiling water on the tomatoes to remove the skins; put them 
into a kettle with one quart of vinegar, and boil two hours; 
strain through a cullender, and add two tablespoonsful of 
celery seed. Bottle while hot. 

COLD CUCUMBER PICKLE. 

Three dozen large cucumbers, eight white onions good size. 
Sprinkle on them three-quarters of a pound of salt, put in 
a cullender and drain twelve hours, then take a teacup of 
white mustard seed, one-half teacup of ground black pepper, 
mix with the cucumbers and cover with vinegar. Good in three 
days. Keep it fastened air-tight. Pare and slice the cucum- 
bers, skin and slice the onions. 

CHOWCHOW PICKLE. 

Cut up fine one large head of cabbage, one dozen onions, 
one dozen green peppers, two dozen green tomatoes, three 
roots of horseradish grated, cover with strong salt and water, 
boil until tender, strain through a sieve. Boil in three pints 
of vinegar, one-half ounce of turmeric, one-quarter pound of 
white mustard seed. Pour this hot over the vegetables ; when

salad oil. 

TOMATO PICKLE. 

One peck green tomatoes sliced thin, sprinkle with salt, let 
stand one night ; slice twelve onions, put with tomatoes, boil 
in vinegar two hours with spices. Four ounces of white 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 229 

mustard seed, four ounces ground mustard, one ounce of tur- 
meric, one ounce of cloves, allspice, cinnamon, ginger and 
pepper, one-quarter cup salt, one-half pound brown sugar. 

ONION PICKLE. 

One peck of white onions (small size), peel them, and for 
nine consecutive mornings scald with fresh salt water, pouring 
off the old. The 10th day drain the onions, and pack in 
jars. Make a dressing of one pound of ground mustard, one 
cup of oil, one pound of sugar, and enough vinegar to cover 
well. Let all come to a boil, and pour over the onions. Do 
not fill your jars too full of the onions, they must have plenty 
of dressing to make them good, and to keep. 

CUCUMBER OR GHERKIN PICKLE. 

Choose small but perfect cucumbers not over a finger long. 
Pack in a stone jar or wooden bucket, in layers, strewing salt 
thickly between these. Cover the top layer with the salt, and 
pour cold water enough to cover all. Lay a small plate or 
round board on them, with a clean stone to keep it down. 
You may leave them in the brine for a week or a month, 
stirring up from the bottom every other day. If the longer 
time, be sure your salt and water is strong enough to bear up 
an egg. If you raise your own cucumbers, pick them every 
day, and drop in the pickle. When you are ready to put them 
up, throw away the brine, with any cucumbers that may have 
softened under the process, and lay the rest in cold fresh water 
for twenty-four hours ; change the water then for fresh, and 
leave it for another day. Have a kettle ready, lined with 
green vine leaves, and lay the pickles evenly within it, scatter- 
'ing powdered alum over the layers; a bit of alum as large as 
a pigeon egg will be enough for a two-gallon kettleful. Fill 
with cold water, cover with vine leaves, three deep ; put a 
close lid or inverted pan over all and steam over a slow fire 
five or six hours, not allowing the water to boil. When the

pickles are a fine green, remove the leaves and throw the 
cucumbers into very cold water. Let them stand in it while 
you prepare the vinegar. To one gallon allow a cup of sugar, 
three dozen whole black peppers, the same of cloves, half as 
much allspice, one dozen blades of mace. Boil five minutes ; 
put the cucumbers into a stone jar and pour the vinegar over 
them scalding hot, cover closely. Two days afterward scald 
the vinegar again and return to the pickles. Repeat this pro- 
cess three times more at intervals of two, four and six days. 
Cover with stoneware or wooden top ; tie stout cloth over this 
and keep in a cool, dry place. They will be ready for eating 
in two months. Examine every few weeks.

pint of very small whole onions, one quart of string beans, very 
tender, one quart of nasturtions if you can get them, one 
pint of sliced green peppers. Let all these lie in salt and 
water a day and night. Then strain them all from the salt 
and water, put on the fire, and cover with vinegar and water ; 
let them come to a boil. Then have your seasoning ready to 
pour over the vegetables, after you drain them from the 
vinegar and and water. Make the seasoning as follows : one-

WINES. 



WINE OF THE FIRST QUALITY. 

Carefully pick the grapes from the stems, rejecting all 
green and decayed berries. Crush them in an ordinary apple 
crusher; should you desire the wine to be light colored, with 
delicacy of taste, press lightly in an ordinary cider press. If 
it is desired to make a red wine, with full body and astringency, 
mash the grapes and let them stand in a cask or vat, covered 
with cloth, for twenty-four hours, before pressing. The 
longer the fermentation of the mask and must continues the 
more astringent and rough the wine will be, and the sooner 
and lighter he presses it the less character will the wine acquire, 
though it will be much more delicate and smooth. Before 
filling the vessels they should be perfectly clean and sweet, 
without the slightest mouldiness. It is best, where wooden 
kegs or casks are used, to dip a strip of canton flannel in 
melted sulphur and igniting it, hang it by a wire in the bung- 
hole of the barrel, and after letting it stand bunged up with 
the vapor of sulphur in it for an hour or so, rinse well with 
clean water. The best ripe juice put in a musty barrel will 
make only a spoiled wine. Should the barrel hold twenty 
gallons put in forty pounds of grape sugar or glucose the 
best is that made by the Buffalo Grape Sugar Co. from corn 
starch that made from potato starch is apt to give an earthy 
taste to the wine. In no case use cane sugar, for the vinous 
fermentation of cane sugar always produces rum, while that pf 
grape sugar produces wine. 

231 




232 WINES. 

As soon as the fermentation commences let the skins, seeds, 
and froth work out of the barrel. This is best accomplished 
by having a tin gutter adapted to a bung piece. As you keep 
the barrel and bung piece full to an 
overflow, all the impurities will work 
out. When clear, the first fermenta- 
tion may be said to begin. Place the 
barrel in a cool cellar, and set it up 
high enough so that it can be drawn 
out by a siphon into another barrel at will, without disturb- 
ing the sediment. Insert in the bung a plug, say four inches 
long, into the centre of which is placed a tube. It is essential 
to wax around the bung and tube, so as 
to force all the carbonic acid gas, that 
results from the fermentation, through 
, , ~ the tube and into the tumbler of water 
[tX^3 * n w hi cn tn e tn ^ e ^ s immersed. If the 
wine is thus put away, say about the 1st 
of September, the first fermentation will last until about the 
15th of October, at which time the barrel 
must be filled up with juice and bunged 
up tight. It is well to look at it every 
two or three weeks, and fill up the bar- 
rel. It is essential to success to keep the 
barrel full, so that as little air as possible 
shall act upon the surface of the wine. In the Spring, say 
April, when the vine is again in bloom, the second fermenta- 
tion will begin. 

SECOND FERMENTATION. 

All that is necessary to be done is to loosen the bung and 
let the barrel have vent. The fermentation will be over 
May 1st, when it will require to be filled again to the bung 
and tightly closed. By the 15th of June the wine will be 
settled clear, when it may be bottled for use.

WINE OF THE SECOND QUALITY. 

After the grapes are pressed the skins and seeds should be 
thrown into a stand cask containing the following mixture : 
Twenty-three gallons rain water, fifty-three pounds grape 
sugar, one pound crystals of tartaric acid. This is normal 
wine, as to its proportions of free acid, grape sugar, and water, 
and will contain about ten per cent, of alcohol, say the strength 
of claret. Should it be desired to make it stronger, twenty- 
three gallons rain water, ninety pounds grape sugar, one 
pound crystals tartaric acid will give the normal wine' of the 
strength of sherry, say seventeen to eighteen per cent, alcohol. 
Having determined the strength you want, throw in the skins 
and seeds of, say, three to four hundred pounds of grapes, 
that is whatever is left after each pressing. 
It is best to put in the pumice immediately, 
and thus save the surface of the skins of 
seeds from the action of the atmosphere. It 
is essential that the stand cask shall have a 
floating lid, perforated with half inch holes, 
so that the skins, which arise when the fermentation begins, 
shall be kept covered with fluid.

Dj An upright piece, reaching to the ceiling of the cellar to

The violent fermentation in the stand cask lasts about ten 
days, and as the skins come to the top they must be well stirred 
up every morning. At the end of ten days the skins will 
begin to sink, when the fluid may be run off at the tap, and 
the refuse pressed, barreled, and treated as the juice of the 
first pressing.

WINES. 



Should you desire to make wine vinegar take twenty-three 
gallons rain water, fifty-three pounds grape sugar, one pound 
tartaric acid, and put back the skins and seeds of the second 
pressing. Treat precisely as you did the second grade wine. 




Stir for the first ten days in the stand cask, and when well 
fermented press again and put the fluid in a barrel, the bung 
of which is a straw plug, and set in a warm shed until it 
becomes vinegar. 

Having given receipts for the manufacture of wine, it fol- 
lows that the best foreign modes of preserving it are essential. 
I therefore quote from John J. Griffen's work, " Chemical 
Testing of Wines and Spirits/ 7 1866, page 128, London. 

"PRESERVATION OF WINES IN PARTLY 
EMPTY CASKS." 

"If a bottle of light wine is opened, and some of the wine 
is left for two or three days in the partly empty bottle, the 
oxygen of the air acts upon the acetic ferment, and the wine 
becomes sour. When wine is cellared in a cask evaporation 
constantly takes place through the pores of the wood, and air 



WINES. 235 

enters by the same passages into the cask to fill the vacuum 
produced by the evaporation. Unless this air is frequently 
expelled by the addition of fresh wine all the wine in the cask 
is liable to turn sour. In places where draught wine is used, 
and where air must be permitted to enter into a cask, in pro- 
portion as wine is drawn from the tap the same difficulty 
occurs, and if the wine is consumed slowly, the oxygen and 
the acetic ferments frequently turn it into acetic acid. This is 
prevented by keeping within the casks a constant pressure of 
carbonic acid gas, which gas keeps the acetic ferment out of 
the reach of free oxygen, without which element the acetifica- 
tion cannot occur; for the conversion of alcohol into acetic 
acid demands a large supply of free oxygen." 

APPARATUS FOR GENERATING CARBONIC ACID GAS. 

A is a stone-ware jar with the mouth sufficiently large to 
admit an ordinary champagne bottle. 




B is a bottle cut off at the bottom (so that it can be sus- 
pended within the stone jar to within an inch and a half of 
the bottom), having a perforated bottom of either lead or 
wood. 



236 WINES. 

C is a bent glass tube fitted to a cork, which tightly fits the 
neck of the bottle. 

D are two half circles of wood dowelled together so as to 
enclose the neck of the bottle and hold it suspended within 
the stone jar A. 

C, a bent glass tube that comes through the cork of the 
bottle B. 

F Fj an india-rubber gum tube that fits on the glass tube C. 

E y a screw clamp that is attached to the gum tube that 
regulates the flow of gas to the barrel. 

6r, the bung of the barrel having a glass tube in its centre, 
to connect with gum tube F F. 

Being ready to make the gas fill the bottle B with pieces of 
broken marble the size of hazel-nuts, and press in the perfo- 
rated bottom. Fill the bottom of the jar A with pebblestones 
to a point that the bottle B does not touch it. Fill the jar A 
about one-half full of diluted muriatic acid, and suspend the 
bottle B in it by means of the wooden top D D. The carbonic 
acid gas will arise in the bottle B, and flow down the tube F F 
into the cask all these must be air-tight. When the passage 
of the gas is stopped the gas collects in the bottle B and drives 
the acid into the outer jar A. When the gas again enters the 
barrel H the acid passes the outer jar A into the bell jar B, 
and produces a fresh supply. Any instrument constructed on 
this principle can evidently be used to keep a constant pres- 
sure of carbonic acid gas in a partly empty barrel of wine, and 
so prevent the access of air and oxygen and the mischief they 
occasion. This is also applicable to cider, ale, or beer on 
draught. 

Wine does not improve in bottles ; besides, for home use, 
it is a great deal more convenient to draw as wanted from the 
cask, and to know that what remains in the partly empty cask 
will go on improving in bulk so long as the air is excluded 
from it.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR HOME-MADE WINES 
OTHER THAN GRAPE. 

Ripe fruit five pounds, soft water one gallon, grape sugar 
two and a half pounds, cream tartar two and a half ounces. 
Ferment in stand keg, and treat same as grape wine. The 
more ripe fruit and grape sugar in proportion to the soft water 
the stronger the wine. 

BLACKBERRY WINE. 

Ripe berries bruised twelve gallons ; pour on them six 
gallons of hot water, let them stand two or three days, stirring 
occasionally ; then strain off the liquor, and to every gallon 
add two and a quarter pounds of sugar; let it stand and fer- 
ment ; before it is bottled add half a gallon of brandy. The 
brandy can be left out if preferred. 

CURRANT SHRUB. 

Draw the currants as for jelly, and to each pint of juice put 
one pound of sugar, half a pint brandy, then bottle it up 
for use. 

GERANIUM CORDIAL. 
(Very fine ; as good as Imported Cordial.) 

A handful of rose geranium leaves dried in the shade for 
several days. Pour over these one pint of alcohol and let it 
stand for two weeks, sometimes shaking the bottle a little. 
Strain and add a pound of loaf sugar boiled into syrup with 
one pint of water. Violets or orange peel can be used in same 
way. Also fresh mint. 

PUNCH. 

One gallon New England rum, one pint lemon juice, juice 
and peel of two oranges, let stand twenty-four hours, then add 
four pounds sugar, one pint strong tea, four pints water. It 
can be bottled in a few days. 



238 WINES.

will keep for years, bottled tight. 

PHILADELPHIA FISH HOUSE PUNCH. 

One quart brandy, two quarts Jamaica rum, half gill of 
brandy, one quart lemon juice (about twenty-four lemons), 
three pounds of sugar, two quarts water. Mix water and 
sugar, strain lemon juice, and add to syrup. Mix liquors 
separately and add to above ; water to suit the taste. Put in 
a large lump of ice. 

ENGLISH CLARET CUP. 

Two bottles of good claret, two of soda water or apollinaris, 
three pounds of ice, two pounds of sugar, three pints of water, 
one large lemon, a little cucumber and fresh mint.

(Medicinal.) 

Two quarts blackberry juice, one pound loaf sugar, four 
grated nutmegs, quarter ounce ground cloves, quarter ounce 
ground allspice, quarter ounce ground cinnamon. Simmer all 
together for thirty minutes in a stew pan closely covered, to 
prevent evaporation. Strain through a cloth when cold, and 
add a pint of the best French brandy. Soothing and effica- 
cious in the summer complaints of children. Dose, one tea- 
spoonful poured on a little pounded ice, once or several times 
a day, as the case may require. Whortleberry cordial may 
be made by the same recipe. Good old whiskey may be used 
for either in the absence of brandy.

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Put one quart of ripe raspberries in a bowl, pour over 
them one quart of good vinegar, let them stand twenty-four 
hours, strain through a bag, pour over this another quart of 
fresh raspberries, and continue to do this for three days ; when 
the last is prepared make it very sweet with white sugar; 

refine and bottle it. 

CURRANT WINE. 

Four pounds currants, add a little water, mash them well, 
and strain through a hair sieve. Then add three pounds sugar 
to the strained liquor ; after it is dissolved strain it again. 
Should not the juice and sugar measure one gallon add as 
much water to the currants as will make up the gallon. Mash 
them over again, put into a clean vessel, leaving room for it 
to work, and stop it tight. 

SUPERIOR PUNCH. 

Half gallon whiskey, one pint Jamaica rum, one quart 
peach cordial from brandy peaches, two pounds sugar, one

peach cordial, one quart whiskey; slice three oranges, one 
lemon, two pounds of loaf sugar, water enough to dissolve 
sugar, or one quart of strong green tea is better. A large 
lump of ice about an hour before it is used. It will keep for 
months bottled.

juice. Put water over the stems and skins, enough to cover 
them. Beat them well, and strain that with the juice. Then 
to each gallon of juice add three pounds of white sugar. Mix 
well, and strain. Let it ferment in an open tub for several 
days, then put it in a cask, which ought to be full, skim it 
well first ; cork tight ; put clay or cement over the bung. 
Draw it off in February and bottle. 



WINES. 241 

BLACKBERRY WINE. 

Take ripe blackberries, mash and press them, strain off the 
juice, and let it stand thirty-six hours to ferment; skim off 
what rises. To every gallon of strained and fermented juice 
add one gallon of cold water, and two pounds of brown sugar. 
Let it stand in open vessels for twenty-four hours, then skim,v 
strain, and put the juice in a cask and close the bung tight. 
Let it stand in the cask until March, when the wine must be 
drawn off and bottled. 

CURRANT WINE.

extracted. Strain juice a second time, to each gallon of juice 
and water add three pounds white sugar, stir until mixed, put 
in clean cask, and leave bung out until the third day, then 
close it very tight, to stand six months before drawn off to be 
bottled. The water used with mashed currants should be cold. 
No matter whether the cask is full or not. 

STRAWBERRY WINE. 

Put the berries in a large vessel, and mash until all the juice 
is obtained. Then to one gallon of juice add three pounds 
white sugar and three quarts water. Strain it well, and put

ing, bottle it at night. It will be ready for use in three days. 

APPLE TODDY, No. i. 

Bake twelve sound, red-streaked apples, put them in a stone 
jar while hot, and mash them well. Then pour on them three 
quarts of boiling water. Cover the jar close, and let them stand 
until cool, then add three pints Cognac brandy, one pint Ja- 
maica rum, half a pint peach brandy, sweeten to taste, and let 
it stand twenty -four hours, stirring frequently and mashing 
well the particles of apple. Then strain for use. A few 
oranges improve the flavor.

RATCLIFFE PUNCH, No. i. 

Rub loaf sugar over the peel of six lemons to break the little 
vessels and absorb the ambrosia of the lemon. Then squeeze 
out the juice of six oranges and six lemons, removing the 
seeds; add to it five pounds of loaf sugar (including the sugar 
rubbed over the peel), and two quarts of water, with five 
cloves and two blades of mace (in a bag). Simmer this over 
the stove about ten minutes, making a syrup. This will keep 
forever. It should be bottled and kept to sweeten the liquors 
when punch is made. Mix one pint of green tea, a scant pint 
of brandy, one quart Jamaica rum, one quart champagne, 
and one teacupful of chartreuse. When well mixed, sweeten 
to taste with the syrup. Pour it into the punch bowl, in 
which is an eight or ten pound piece of ice. Slice three oranges 
and three lemons, and put them also into the punch bowl, 
removing the seeds. This is delicious. 

EGG-NOGG. 

Beat the yolks ofsix eggs and half a pound of sugar together 
until it froths. Add half a pint of brandy or whiskey, next 
the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, and then three pints of 
whipped cream. 

COBBLERS. 

These can be made of sherry, claret, or Catawba wine. Put 
four or five tablespoonsful of the wine into a glass with half 
a tablespoon of sugar; one or two thin slices of orange or 
lemon may be added. Fill the glass with finely-chopped or 
crushed ice. Now pour this from one glass to another once 
or twice to mix well. Then put two or three strawberries in 
for a garnish. Each glass should be furnished with two straws. 

EGG AND MILK PUNCH. 

Stir well a heaping teaspoonful of sugar and the yolk of an 
egg together in a goblet, then add a tablespoonful of best 



WINES. 245 

brandy. Fill the glass with cream or milk until it is three- 
quarters full, then stir well into the mixture the white of an egg 
beaten to a stiff froth. 

MILK PUNCH. 

Sweeten a glass of half milk and cream to taste, and add 
one or two tablespoons best brandy and grated nutmeg. 

FRUIT CORDIAL. 

Half pint black cherries, quarter pound ginger sliced, half 
ounce cinnamon, the same of cloves. Put these into a jug with 
proof spirit. Cork it, and let it stand till autumn. As black- 
berries, raspberries, or currants ripen add them, always adding 
sufficient spirit to cover the fruit. In autumn pour off the 
spirit and cover the fruit with pure water, and let it remain a 
week or more. Then strain off and mix with the spirit. 
Sweeten to taste. You may add apple parings or pineapples, 
but the black cherry is the most important fruit. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL. 

To two quarts of juice add one pound white sugar, half 
ounce pulverized cinnamon, same of pulverized cloves. Boil 
all together for a short time. When cold add one pint brandy. 

BITTERS. 

One ounce gentian, one ounce cardamon seed, one ounce 
chamomile flowers, some dried orange peel. Bruise all together, 
and pour on this quantity three pints of good whiskey or 
brandy. If preferred strain it off after it has stood some 
time. This is an excellent recipe, and a tablespoonful in a 
little sugar and water is beneficial occasionally. 

REGENT PUNCH. 

Take a large cup of the best strong black tea, in which put 
the rind of two lemons cut very thin ; add to this one pint of 



246 WINES. 

sugar, three wineglasses of brandy, three of rum, the juice of 
three lemons and of two oranges, and one quart bottle of 
champagne. Put in a large lump of ice. For a large quan- 
tity measure everything by pints. 

CLARET PUNCH. 

Pour one quart bottle claret into a bowl or pitcher, add one 
pint water, sweeten to taste; throw in some slices of lemon. 
If preferred use no water, only ice. 

APPLE TODDY. 

One gallon apple brandy, one pint peach brandy, one pint 
French brandy, one pint Madeira wine, and one dozen apples 
baked without peeling. Sweeten to taste. About two pounds 
sugar to this quantity, and just enough hot water to dissolve 
the sugar. 

LEMON BRANDY. 

One pint brandy, the rind of two lemons, two ounces loaf 
sugar, quarter pint water. Peel the lemons, but be careful 
not to get any of the white pith. Put the rind into a bottle 
with the brandy, and let them infuse for twenty-four hours, 
then strain them. Boil the sugar and water for a few 
moments. Skim it, and when cold add it to the brandy. A 
dessert-spoonful of this is an excellent flavoring for custards. 
Oranges may be used in the same manner. 

CLARET PUNCH, No. i. 

One gallon claret; three oranges, sliced, taking out the 
seeds ; three lemons, sliced ; two pounds sugar ; no water ; a 
lump of ice just before using it.

Angostura bitters, as it possesses a certain rich flavor, that no 
other bitters has. 

SELIGSON'S FRAPPED CAFE ROYAL. 

It consists of three-fourths of a cup of black coffee, one-

COFFEE AND TEA, ETC. 



TO MAKE COFFEE WITH MILK. 

Take three-quarters of a mill of ground coffee, dampen it 
with white of egg, and add cold water enougli to cover it. 
Then add one teacupful of boiling water, and set it to boil for 
two minutes. Now pour on this one pint of cold fresh milk, 
let it boil tivelve minutes, and then stand five minutes to settle. 

CUBAN COFFEE. 

Put three pints of rich sweet milk into a coffee-pot a,nd 
let it boil. When it is boiling put in a teacupful of ground 
coffee, and boil it five minutes. Strain and serve it. 

TEA. 

Put the table teapot near the fire till it is quite hot. Put 
in the dry tea leaves, and replace the pot, closely covered, 
near the fire for five minutes. Fill the teapot full of boiling 
water, and let it stand on the table at least three minutes be- 
fore pouring out. One teaspoonful of leaves to every pint 
is about the allowance. In hot summer strong black tea, to 
which lemon juice and sugar have been added, will be found 
very refreshing. The tea may be made in the morning, and 
placed on ice about an hour before using, adding the lemon 
jniee and sugar at table. If ice is left in the tea it weakens 
it too much. 

HOW TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. 

Grate one-half pound of Walter Baker's chocolate, and stir 
on it gradually one pint of boiling water. Mix it to a smooth 

259 



260 

paste. To this add slowly one gallon of rich milk (new milk 
is best). When well mixed put it on the fire and let it boil 
half an hour, stirring all the time, and being careful not to let 
it scorch. Whites of two eggs, beaten to a stiff icing, season 
with vanilla, and serve on top the cup of chocolate. The 
chocolate will not require much more sugar. 

TO MAKE CHOCOLATE (for One.) 

Take two heaping tablespoonsful of Walter Baker's choco- 
late, grated ; mix it into a paste with cold water, then add one 
pint of boiling milk. Let it come to a boil. A great improve- 
ment is the white of an egg beaten stiff and placed on top of 
the chocolate after it is poured in the cup. If you wish choco- 
late for more than one person, the whites of four eggs are 
enough for a gallon, and if you prefer it thicker put four 
spoonsful of chocolate to a pint of milk. 

GOOD BOILED COFFEE. 

One teacupful ground coffee already cleared. Mix with a 
little cold water, then add one quart of boiling water and some 
eggshells. Let it come to a good boil. When done add about 
a tablespoonful of cold water, and let it stand a few moments 
before pouring off and sending to table. 

FRENCH COFFEE. 

Allow a tablespoonful of the best Java or Mocha coffee ; 
place it when ground in the biggin, and pour a teacup of 
boiling water over it to every spoonful of coffee ; let it drip 
slowlv on the stove.

FOR INVALIDS. 



CHICKEN BROTH. 

Wash half the breast and one wing of a tender chicken. 
Put it in a saucepan with one and a half pints of water, a 
little salt, and a tablespoon ful of rice or pearl barley. Let 
it simmer slowly and skim it. When the chicken is thor- 
oughly done take it out of the broth. Serve the latter in a 
bowl with light bread or a fresh cracker. 

IRISH MOSS JELLY. 

Wash two handsful of carragreen or Irish moss through 
two or three waters, then drain, and pour on it three pints of 
boiling water. Let it simmer until the moss becomes a com- 
plete pulp, then strain it and sweeten to taste. After this add 
the juice of two large lemons. Do not eat until cold. Sea 
moss, blanc mange, and tapioca jelly, given among the desserts, 
are good for invalids. 

SAGO. 

Pick and wash the sago, and to prevent the earthy taste, 
which renders it so unpleasant, soak it in cold water for an 
hour or two. Pour off the water, add more, and boil it gently 
until it becomes clear. Sweeten it with loaf sugar, and add 
wine and spice if approved. 

BEEF TEA. 

Cut about one pound of lean beef into small pieces, put 
them into a wide-mouthed bottle, such as a pickle bottle, cork 
it tightly, and place it in a pot of cold water in which there 

261 



262 FOR INVALIDS. 

is a saucer of cold water at the bottom. Heat it gradually, 
then let it boil slowly two or three hours when all the juice 
will be extracted. Now pour off the juice, season it with 
salt carefully, as it requires very little. When cold skim off 
all the globules of fat. 

HOW TO PREPARE AN UNCOOKED EGG. 

Beat well the yolk and a teaspoonful of sugar in a goblet, 
then stir in one or two teaspoonsful of brandy, sherry, or 
port wine. Add to this mixture the white of the egg;, beaten 

L Oc5/ 

to a stiff froth. Stir all well togetner. It should quite fill 
the goblet. If wine is not desired flavor the egg with nut- 
meg, but it is very palatable without any flavoring at all. 

PANADA. 

Break in pieces some stale loaf bread and put them in a 
saucepan. Cover them with cold water, and leave them an 
hour. Then set the saucepan on the fire and add salt, butter, 
and sugar to taste. Let it simmer about an hour, then add 
two yolks of eggs beaten with two tablespoonsful of wine. 

ICELAND MOSS. 

Take one ounce Iceland moss, wash it, and boil it in one 
quart of water until it is reduced to a pint. Then strain it, 
and add one pound white sugar and the juice of two lemons. 
It is very palatable and can be used as freely as desired. This 
is excellent for a cough. 

EGG WATER. 

Take white of an egg, put it in a pint of cold water. Add 
a small pinch of soda. Beat it up well, and keep in the ice. 
This is an invaluable receipt for a baby with delicate stomach, 
just let her drink it whenever she wants water. It is also 
good for a grown person, with a few drops of lemon juice. 



FOR INVALIDS. 263 

BARLEY. 

Take two ounces of barley and wash it in cold water. 
Then boil it in half a pint water for a short time, and strain 
it. Pour over it four pints boiling water, and let it boil down 
to two pints. Then strain it again. Sweeten this if desired. 

LEMON SPONGE. 

One pint water, one ounce isinglass, the grated rind of one 
lemon, and half a pound loaf sugar. Let. it simmer for half 
an hour, then strain it through a fine sieve. When nearly 
cold add the juice of three lemons and the white of one egg. 
Whisk all together until thick and white. 

CORN MEAL GRUEL. 

Take half a pint of sifted corn meal. White corn meal is 
the only kind fit to use in making gruel. Moisten it with 
cold water, and stir it in one and a half pints of boiling water, 
and add salt to taste. Stir it well, so that there will be no 
lumps in it, and let it boil an hour. 

PANADA. 

Toast a slice of stale bread, break it in a pint bowl, add a 
small lump of butter, two wine glasses full of sherry or 
Madeira wine, a few cloves and allspice, one dozen raisins, 
nutmeg and sugar to taste ; fill the bowl with boiling water 
and cover it closely. To be eaten in five minutes. 

GRAPE JUICE. 

To three quarts of fresh, ripe, juicy grapes, freed from the 
stems, put one quart of water, no sugar. Let it come slowly 
to a boil, and when the whole mass is boiling hot strain the 
juice through cheese cloth. Then return liquor to the fire, and 
as soon as it arrives at boiling point again, can it. Use glass 
jars to put it in. 



264 FOR INVALIDS. 

" We use Virginia Waukesha Lithia Water entirely, and 
find it a wonderful water, especially in all Kidney troubles, 
and also for Rheumatism and Headaches. We are never 
without it. It is a great regulator, and certainly possesses 
invaluable properties." 

" Horsford's Acid Phosphate is the best tonic, for Dyspepsia? 
and having used it in our family for several years, find it 
invaluable in cases of Malaria, and also Insomnia. We rec- 
ommend it most highly. 

"I recommend Armour's Extract of Beef as decidedly the 
best on the market. It not only gives to soups a zest and 
flavor which are very hard to obtain in any other way, but it 
is also a most convenient and satisfactory article to have in 
the sick room. It is not mawkish or nauseating; but pos- 
sesses a nice Roast-Beef flavor and is unquestionably a pure 
Essence of Beef, concentrated. 

" There are times when predigested nourishment is invalu- 
able, and I know of nothing better than Armour's Nutrient 
Wine of Beef- Pep tone when one is enfeebled or debilitated. 
I have had personal experience of its value in my family and 
cannot say too much in praise of it." 



CANDY. 



MOLASSES CANDY. TAFFY. 

None but the best molasses should be used, the poorer kiuds 
will Dot candy. The boiling syrup should be stirred fre- 
quently, from the first, to prevent burning, and, after it 
becomes thick, it will be necessary to stir constantly. Try it 
by dropping a little into a cup of cold water, or by setting a 
small quantity out of doors to cool. It is done when it can 
easily be pulled, or when, if chewed, it does not stick to the 
teeth. It will make the candy less brittle and whiter if, ten 
minutes before taking it off, cooking soda be added in the 
proportion of an even teaspoonful to a gallon of molasses. 
Take out a cupful of the syrup and mix the soda well in. 
Then take the kettle from the fire and stir the mixture into 
the syrup. It will bubble up, and vigorous stirring will be 
needed to keep it from boiling over. Return to the fire and 
stir steadily until done, which ought to be in about ten min- 
utes. For sugar taffy to three pounds of sugar allow half 
a teacupful of water and half a. cupful of vinegar. Set on the 
back of the stove until the sugar is dissolved. Then bring it 
forward and let it stew steadily until done, which may be deter- 
mined in the same way as with the molasses. Do not stir the 
candy while stewing, as so doing makes it turn back to sugar. 
If you do not wish it hard and brittle, add an even teaspoonful 
of soda in the same way as with the molasses taffy only don't 
stir it. In pulling taffy it is a mistake to oil the hands. The 
candy will be nicer if instead you wash your hands occasion- 
ally with cold water, drying them perfectly afterwards. Use 

265 



266 CANDY. 

fresh butter or olive oil for greasing the pans into which you 
pour the candy to cool. 

MOLASSES CANDY. From Vassar College. 

One cup molasses, two cups sugar, one tablespoonful of vine- 
gar. Mix and boil for ten minutes. When done add a lump 
of butter and a teaspoonful of vanilla, or any other flavoring ; 
to be pulled until light. 

COCOANUT AND CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

Cocoanut candy is made by taking two pounds of sugar to 
an ordinary cocoanut. Add the milk of the cocoanut to the 
sugar, with a little water, if the milk is less than a small tea- 
cupful. Stew until it ropes when poured from the spoon, 
then stir in the cocoanut, which you should have already 
grated, and pour into buttered pans. When cool, break into 
pieces a process which will be facilitated if, when the candy 
is cool, but not cold, you score it half through with a knife, 
and nut candy can be made in the same manner by substi- 
tuting nut kernels for the grated cocoanuts. For cream candy 
allow a cupful of rich cream to three pounds of sugar, and 
stew until the syrup candies when dropped into cold water. 
Then flavor with vanilla, lemon, or what you like, and pour 
into buttered pans to cool, or pull the candy as you prefer. 
Another recipe for cream candy, without the cream, requires 
two cups of granulated sugar, half a cup of water, a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Do 
not stir while boiling. When done pour on buttered plates, 
and when cool pull it until white. 

There are many recipes for chocolate caramels. The fol- 
lowing will be reliable: To a pint of milk add three pounds 
of sugar and a half pound of butter. Let the mixture come 
to a boil, when add a half a pound of chocolate scraped fine. 
Let it boil until quite thick, stirring all the time. It will be 



CANDY. 267 

better if you mix the chocolate smooth with a cupful of boil- 
ing milk before adding it to the whole quantity. When done, 
flavor with lemon or vanilla, and pour into buttered pans. 
When nearly cold cut into small squares. A delicious fruit 
candy is made by adding chopped raisins and figs to a syrup 
made by stewing two pounds of sugar with the juice of two 
lemons, or, if lemons are not at hand, with a cupful of vine- 
gar flavored with essence of lemon. Dried cherries and any 
firm preserves may be used instead of the raisins and figs. For 
cream chocolates, take one pound white sugar, a teacupful of 
water and half a pound of chocolate. Scrape the chocolate 
and set it on the back of the stove to melt into a paste. Boil 
the sugar and water together for ten or fifteen minutes, then 
take off and beat rapidly until it is creamy ; flavor to taste, 
then roll into small balls, a teaspoonful to each ball, and dip 
in the chocolate until covered. For this you can use two 
forks, handling the balls carefully. Lay them on buttered 
paper to cool. 

BARLEY SUGAR, AND BURNT ALMONDS. 

The following recipe for barley sugar, a favorite candy with 
the English children, is taken from an English magazine : 
One and a half pounds of fine loaf sugar should be broken 
into small lumps and boiled over the fire with a pint of water. 
It should be skimmed carefully till it looks like glue, and 
when dropped into cold water becomes brittle and will snap. 
The juice of a lemon and six drops of essence of lemon should 
now be added, the sugar boiled up just once, and then the 
bottom of the pan should be placed in cold water till the first 
heat has subsided. The preparation should then be poured 
upon a marble slab, which has been slightly smeared with 
butter. It will, of course, spread out, but it should be drawn 
together with a knife, and keep as much as possible in a lump. 
As soon as it is cool enough to handle, pieces about the size 
of an egg may be cut off, rolled to the form of round sticks, 



268 CANDY. 

and twisted slightly, as barley sugar usually is bought. These 
should be put on an oiled sheet and left till they are cold and 
stiff, when sugar should be sifted light over them. 

For burnt almonds take a pound of almonds and bleach 
by scalding in hot water, when the skins will easily slip off. 
Dry them and warm them slightly. Three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar should now be boiled with half a pint of water, till 
the surface looks like large pearls or globules, when a few 
drops of prepared cochineal, a few drops of vanilla, or any 
other suitable essence, and the almonds should be thrown in 
and all stirred gently together with a wooden spoon, to detach 
the sugar from the bottom and sides of the saucepan. The 
almonds should be kept from sticking to the pan, and should 
be thoroughly turned over and over, so that they might be 
well coated, or, as it is called, " charged," with sugar. As 
soon as they give out a cracking noise the pan should be re- 
moved from the fire and still gently stirred, until the sugar 
has the appearance of being grained almost like sand, when 
almonds, sugar and all should be turned upon a wire sieve and 
covered with paper for five minutes. 

At the end of that time the almonds should be picked out 
and the grained sugar put again into the sugar-boiler with 
just enough water to dissolve it, and when it is again boiled 
to the point it had before reached, the almonds should be 
thrown in again and stirred until they have received another 
coating, being careful only to keep them entirely separate.

CURING, CANNING, ETTC. 



RECIPE FOR BEEF BRINE. 

Four gallons of water, six pounds of salt, two ounces 
saltpetre, six and a half pounds of brown sugar; boil these 
together, and skim the liquid as it boils. Pour it over the 
beef when the liquid is cold. The beef must be previously 
rubbed with salt, and the bloody brine allowed to run off. 
This should be done two or three days before the brine is 
poured over the beef, which it should cover. 

PICKLE FOR BUTTER. 

Haifa pound salt, one ounce saltpetre, half a pound sugar, 
to three quarts of water. Scald and skim the pickle; when 
cold pour it over the butter. 

TO CURE SHAD. 

Strike the shad as you would herrings, then put it on a 
board, with a stone on it to press it down. Let them remain 
three days, then take them out aud wash them in brine. Drain 
them well. To every hundred shad add one pound saltpetre, 
one pound brown sugar, mixed well together with as much 
alurn salt as you think proper. In packing put alternate 
layers of shad and salt. 

TO CURE BEEF HAMS. 

To two pounds of meat take three ounces saltpetre, four 
ounces brown sugar, one pint fine salt. Mix well together. 
Rub the meat thoroughly all over, and lay it by for twenty - 
18 273 



274 



four hours, then salt it down in an open tub, or on a shelf, to 
let it drain, with two quarts fine salt. Let it lie fifteen days, 
then hang it up. If you prefer to put it in pickle, do so after 
it has lain four or five days. 

TO CURE PORK HAMS. 

To every 1000 pounds of pork put three quarters bushel of 
salt, two and a half pounds brown sugar, and two and a half 
pounds saltpetre, half a gallon of molasses. Mix all together, 
and rub on well, first hams, then shoulders, and then mid- 
dlings. Keep in salt four weeks, then hang them up, 
and smoke them occasionally, for four or five weeks, with 
green hickory wood. 

TO MAKE GOOD SAUSAGE MEAT. 

To every fourteen pounds of meat cut fine take three ounces 
of salt, two ounces black pepper, half pint sage, one ounce 
saltpetre, a very little red pepper, and spices if you like (eighty 
cloves and quarter ounce allspice). 

SAUSAGE MEAT. 

Twenty-five pounds lean meat, two and a half pounds leaf 
fat, two and a half pounds chine fat, six ounces salt, five 
ounces pounded sage, five ounces of pepper. Cut the meat 
and fat in small pieces, mix it well with the salt, sage, and 
pepper, and grind in chopper. 

SAUSAGE MEAT. 

For fifty-one pounds sausage take twenty-seven pounds 
fillet, twenty-four pounds chine fat, three quarter pounds salt, 
six ounces sage, three ounces pepper, a small teaspoonful salt- 
petre, the same of red pepper, and the same of cloves pounded 
fine. Mix all these well together, and add it to the sau- 
sage meat. If necessary pass the meat through the chop- 
per twice. 



275 



TO PRESERVE BUTTER FOR WINTER. 

Take equal quantities of salt, saltpetre, and fine loaf sugar, 
well mixed. When packing the butter allow one ounce to 
every pound of butter. Put thick cloths on the top. This 
will keep till late in spring. 

TO CURE BEEF. 

To forty-five pounds of beef take two quarts coarse salt, 
one pound brown sugar, one teaspoon saltpetre. Mix all well 
together, and rub the meat thick with it. Keep rubbing it 
on until all is gone. Let it lie for two weeks, then take it 
out, pour boiling water over it, and hang it up in a dry place. 

ANOTHER RECIPE. 

Take six pounds alum salt, half pound brown sugar, half 
ounce saltpetre, four gallons water. Boil these ingredients 
until they are dissolved, taking off the scum as it rises. Let 
this get quite cool, then pour it on the meat. Do not take 
more meat than the pickle will cover. 

TO CURE BACON. 

One thousand pounds meat, half bushel of salt, one pound 
saltpetre, and eight pounds brown sugar. Mix all well, and 
rub the meat hard with them, on both sides of the piece. 
From four to five weeks is sufficient for the meat to take salt. 
Every ten days take the meat out, expose it to the atmosphere 
half an hour, then wash it in the pickle it has made. It is 
better to dip the meat in water, and wipe it with a coarse cloth 
before hanging it up to smoke. All meat ought to be secured 
from the fly before the first of March by smoking. Smoke 
with hickory and decayed wood so as to occasion a smother. 
After rubbing, meat should be put in casks where it makes 
its own pickle.

IMPORTANT TO BUTTER MAKERS. 

A method in practice among the best butter makers in 
England for re'ndering butter firm and solid during the hot 
weather is as follows : Carbonate of soda and alum made into 
powder are used for the purpose. For twenty pounds of 
butter, one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and one of pow- 
dered alum, mixed together at the time of churning, and put 
into the cream. The effect of this powder is to make the 
butter come firm and solid, and give it a clean, sweet flavor. 
It does not enter into the butter, but its action is upon the 
cream, and it passes off with the buttermilk. The ingredients 
of the powder should not be mixed together until required to be 
used, or at the time the cream is in the churn ready for churning. 

BEEF PICKLE. 

Four gallons spring water, four ounces saltpetre, six pounds 
alum salt, one and a half pounds brown sugar, and one ounce 
of potash. 

CANNED SALMON. 

California canned salmon is a great success in canning. It 
is very nice for breakfast heated, seasoned with pepper and 
salt, placed on thin slices of buttered toast, with a cream 
dressing poured over all. For dinner it is excellent with 
any fish sauce. 

CANNED TOMATOES AND OKRA FOR SOUP. 

Throw ripe tomatoes into boiling water, then peel them. 
Put them into a bell metal kettle and boil them. As the 
water rises dip part of it off, or it will require a long time 
to reduce the tomatoes so as to can them. Boil until almost 
ready for table use. In the meantime wash the okra, cut 
it crosswise, drop it into boiling water, and let it boil half 
an hour, skimming it several times. Dip it up with a perfor- 
ated ladle, drop it into the tomatoes, and let all boil half an 
hour. Then put in tin cans, and seal them up while hot. 



CURING, CANNING, ETC. 277 

TO SEAL PRESERVES. 

Beat the white of an egg, take tissue paper the size you 
require, and dip it into the egg, wetting the paper on both 
sides. Then cover the jar, carefully pressing it securely round 
the sides. 

TO CAN TOMATOES. 

Pour boiling water on the tomatoes till you can easily peel 
them. Then put them in a kettle, and cook down till the 
water from the tomatoes is nearly out. Can while hot, and 
seal immediately. 

TO PREPARE RENNET. 

Take the stomach from the calf as soon as it is killed. Do 
not wash it, but hang it in a dry, cool place for four or five 
days. Then turn it inside out, slip off all the curd nicely 
with the hand, fill it with a little saltpetre mixed with the 
necessary quantity of salt, and lay it in a small stone pot. 
Pour over it a small teaspoonful of vinegar, and sprinkle a 
handful of salt over it, covering it closely to keep it for use. 
Never wash it; that would weaken the gastric juice, and in- 
jure the rennet. After it has been salted six or eight weeks, 
cut off a piece four or five inches long, put it in a large mus- 
tard bottle, or any vessel that will hold about a pint and a 
half. Put on it five gills of cold water, and two gills of rose 
brandy. Stop it very close, and shake it always before using. 
A tablespoonful of this is sufficient for a quart of milk. It 
must be prepared in very cool weather, and if well done will 
keep more than a year. 

TOMATOES FOR BROILING. (Very fine.) 

Take nice large smooth tomatoes. Cut them in half right 
through the centre. Then put them in your baking pan with 
the cut side down, with very little water. As soon as they 
get hot, put them carefully in new tin cans, which also must 
be very hot. Seal them up at once, they are as good as fresh.

TO CLEAN CALF'S HEAD AND FEET. 

These directions are, of course, for those who live in the 
country, and butcher their own meats. As soon as the animal 
is killed have the head and feet taken off, wash them clean, 
sprinkle some pounded rosin all over the hairs, then dip them 
in boiling water, and take them instantly out. The rosin will 
dry immediately, and they may be scraped clean with ease. 
The feet should be soaked in water three or four days, chang- 
ing it daily. This will make them very white. 

HOW TO MAKE VINEGAR. 

To four quarts rain water put one pound of coarse brown 
sugar, or one pint of molasses. Boil it well and skim it; 
pour it into a tub, and add one quart of rain water to each 
gallon of the above, then take a slice of well raised bread, 
toast it brown, and cover it well with yeast, put it in a tub, 
cover it with a cloth, and let it remain four or five days to 
work, then pour it off into a good cask. Roll up a sheet of 
white paper and put it in the cask for mother. Let it stand 
four or six months. If not sour enough add one gallon of 
whiskey. To keep vinegar put in all slops of tea, brandy, 
wine, lemonade, and scum of preserves. 

HORSERADISH VINEGAR. 

Half pound scraped horseradish, one ounce of minced es- 
chalot, one drachm cayenne pepper, and one quart vinegar. 
Put all the ingredients in a bottle, shaking frequently for a 
fortnight. When steeped well, strain and bottle for use. It 
is good in two weeks. 

HOW TO MIX MUSTARD. 

Ingredients. Mustard, salt, and water. Mustard should 
be mixed with water that has been boiled and allowed to cool. 
Put the mustard in a cup with a pinch of salt. Add the 



CURING, CANNING, ETC. 279 

water gradually, and make it into a smooth paste. You can 
make it as thin as you like. 

RECIPE FOR PRESERVING CORN. 

Cut the corn from the cob, uncooked, pack it down in a jar 
in alternate layers of salt and corn. When the jar is tightly 
packed put a thick layer of salt on the top, and tie a thick 
piece of cotton over the jar. Cover it and set it away in a 
cool place. Before using the corn in winter it must be soaked 
an hour in warm water to extract the salt, and then boiled in 
fresh water. 

TO PRESERVE ORANGES WHOLE. 

With a sharp penknife take off the outer skin of the orange 
as thin as possible. Boil the fruit in water until you can 
puncture the skin with a straw. Make a small hole in the 
fruit at the stem with the handle of a teaspoon ; take out all 
the seeds, being particular that none are left. Make a syrup 
of two pounds of sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil the syrup 
and take the scum off. Boil the fruit in the syrup until the 
oranges look clear and transparent. 

TO PREPARE SYRUP FOR PRESERVES. 

To every pound sugar allow one gill water, and let it stand 
till dissolved; to every twelve pounds allow half ounce Russian 
isinglass. Dissolve it in a little boiling water. Put it in with 
the sugar. When cold place it on the fire, let it boil, skim- 
ming constantly, till no more scum will rise. The syrup is 
then ready for any fruit you may wish to preserve. 

BEEF PICKLE. 

Five gallons of brine, strong enough to bear an egg, one 
gallon of boiling lye. Let it stand until clear and cold, not 
strong. Add one pound brown sugar and six ounces of salt- 
petre. Mix all well, and pour it on the meat. This is good 
for pork also. 



280 CURING, CANNING, ETC. 



SAUSAGE. 

Six pounds lean fresh pork, two pounds fat fresh pork, 
twelve teaspoonsful powdered sage, six of black pepper, six 
of salt, two of powdered mace, two of cloves, and one grated 
nutmeg. Grind the meat, fat and lean, in a sausage mill. 
Mix the seasoning well ; taste it to be sure all is right, and 
pack it down in stone jars, pouring melted lard on top. If 
you wish to make link sausage prepare the intestines as 
follows : Empty them, cut them in lengths, and lay them in 
salt and water for two days; then turn them inside out, 
and let them soak one day longer. Then scrape and rinse 
them well in soda and water ; wipe them and blow into one 
end, having tied up the other with a little twine. If they are 
whole and clear stuff with the meat; then tie them up and 
hang them up in the cellar. 

TO KEEP GAME FROM TAINTING. 

Draw them as soon as they come into your possession. Rinse 
with soda and water, then with pure cold water. Wipe them 
dry, and rub them lightly with a mixture of fine salt and 
black pepper. If you must keep them for some time put in 
the cavity of each fowl a piece of charcoal, and hang them in 
a cool dark place with a cloth thrown over them. 

TO BROWN FLOUR. 

Spread some flour on a tin plate, set it upon the stove or in 
a very hot oven, and stir it continually after it begins to color 
until it is brown all through. Keep some always on hand as 
it is always coming in use. Put it away in a closely covered 
glass jar, and shake it every few days to keep it light and 
prevent it from lumping. 

THE BEST MODE OF KEEPING BUTTER. 

Have the butter well washed. Work it three times, then 
have ready a pickle made by the .recipe given before, and have 



CURING, CANNING, ETC. 281 

some corn shucks prepared as follows : When they are dry 
remove the ear of corn carefully, then scald the shucks. Let 
them lie in the sun until dry. Meanwhile work the butter 
into the shape of ears of corn, and when the shucks are dry 
dip them in ice water, then open them carefully and place the 
butter inside, and fold the layers of the shucks nicely over. 
Then tie them up tight and put them in the pickle ; put a 
heavy weight over it, and keep it covered with the pickle. 
This butter, if prepared properly, I have kept a year. 


TO CURE CORN FOR WINTER USE. 

Take nice sugar corn about the month of September. Re- 
move the first layer of shuck ; then have ready a tight barrel. 
Pack the corn in tightly, standing it on end, and pour over it 
a strong brine, strong enough to bear an egg. This brine 
should be boiled and well skimmed, but not poured over the 
corn until cold. Place a heavy weight on the corn to keep it 
under the brine. Cover closely. It will be good until spring, 
and tastes like fresh corn. It can be boiled on the ear just 
as it is packed. 

TO CURE PIG'S FEET FOR SOUSE. 

As soon as the feet are cut off have them scraped clean. 
This can be done by dipping them first in hot lye, removing 
the hair and the hoofs ; then have some whitewash ready 
heated. Dip them in it, and scrape off at once with a knife. 
Now wash them through two waters, after which put them 
in clean cold water, and let them lie until next day. Then 
change the water, and the third day wash them well, and put 
them on to boil. When done have ready a pickle made of 
strong salt and water, with some meal in it, and flavor it with 
a little vinegar. This pickle must come to a boil, and when 
cold pour over the feet, after they also are cold. This will 
keep them sweet for weeks. They are nice washed off and 



282 CURING, CANNING, ETC. 

eaten cold, or cut in half, sprinkled with flour, and fried in 
boiling lard. 

TO MAKE LARD. 

Take the leaf fat, wash it off with warm water, remove the 
skin, and cut the fat in small pieces. Put one quart water in 
a large pot, and dissolve in it three teaspoonsful of bread soda. 
Then fill up the pot with lard and set it on the fire. Stir it 
constantly to keep it from scorching. When the cracklings 
are a light brown, and commence to sink, the lard is done. 
Strain it through a coarse cloth; put it in tin "cans or stone 
jars, and tie it up tight. No salt is used with the soda, and I 
have found, from long experience, that soda is the better of 
the two to use. Meat fat is prepared the same way. It is 
best to keep it separate. The butcher's fat requires no water, 
as it has to lie in water twenty-four hours before it can be 
cooked. Put more soda to it than to lard.

HOW TO COOK A HUSBAND. 

First catch him. Many good husbands are spoiled in the 
cooking. Some women go about it as if their husbands were 
bladders and blow them up. Others keep them too much in 
hot water, while others freeze them with icy indifference and 
freezing coolness. Some smother them with constant conten- 
tion, hatred and variance, and some keep them in hot pickle 
all their lives. These women always serve them up with 
tongue sauce. Now it cannot be supposed that husbands will 
be tender and palatable if cooked in this way, on the contrary, 
they are tart, tough and snappish actually good for nothing. 
If, however, cooked by the following recipe they are prime and 
delicious. Get a large jar, called the jar of faithfulness (which 
all good wives keep on hand), place your husband in it, and 
set him near the fire of conjugal love, let the fire be pretty 
hot, but especially let it burn clear, and above all let the heat 
be constant. Cover him with affectionate kindness and confi- 
dence, garnished with modest and becoming familiarity and 
spiced with amiable pleasantry, and if you add a few sweet 
kisses and other confectionaries, let them be accompanied with 
sufficient portion of secrecy mixed with prudence and moder- 
ation. And let the whole conjugal life be seasoned with love 
and devotional piety. We would advise all good wives to try 
this recipe and realize what an admirable dish a husband 
makes when properly and discreetly cooked.

of loaf sugar, then add half a pint of Jamaica rum, and bottle 
it. Dose for a child one teaspoonful before each meal ; for a 
grown person a sherry glassful. 

TO COOK PUDDINGS IN BOILING WATER. 

Wet and flour the cloth before putting in the pudding. In 
tying it leave room enough for the pudding to swell. If 
cooked in a mould, do not fill the mould quite full. Never 
let the water stop boiling. As it wastes away in boiling 
replenish the kettle from another containing boiling water. 
It is better to cook puddings (plum puddings as well) in a 
steamer than in boiling water. The principle is just the same, 
and there is no water soaked. 

FOR CLEANSING LACES. 

Pour a little pure, clear alcohol into a china bowl, or other 
deep vessel that can be covered to prevent evaporation, into 
which place the lace to be cleaned. Leave it some time, till 
the dirt has softened and settled at the bottom. Then, with 
perfectly clean fingers, rub the lace gently in the liquid till 
all the stains have disappeared. If they do not come out 
let it soak longer. After rubbing squeeze the lace as dry as 



288 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

possible. Take one piece at a time while damp and pull it 
out with the fingers, picking out the edge very carefully with 
the nails. It should be damp while handling it. When the 
meshes are all opened lay the lace between the leaves of a 
book, and press it till entirely dry, taking care to fold it in 
and out among the leaves, so as not to crease it. If the lace 
is very much soiled rub it gently in soapsuds before using the 
alcohol. In such cases do not rinse it. Black lace can be 
beautifully renovated this way. 

RECIPE FOR SOFT SOAP. 

Fifteen ounces of castile soap, thirty ounces sal soda, six 
drachms of pulverized arrow-root. Put these ingredients into 
six quarts of hot water that has just come to a boil. When 
these are dissolved add fifteen quarts of cold water, and let the 
whole come to a boil. The soap is then done and is fit for use 
as soon as cold. The castile soap should be scraped fine and 
the soda pounded. A teaspoonful of hartshorn added to the 
soap used will remove tar, paint, or grease spots from cloth. 

AN EXCELLENT MIXTURE FOR WASHING CHINA, 
GLASS, OR SILVER. 

Fill a stone jar with alternate layers of any good laundry 
soap, shaved very thin, and of washing soda. When the jar 
is full, pour over the mixture cold rain water. Let it stand a 
few days until it jellies. Put one tablespoonful to a pan of 
hot water when needed for use. 

HARD SOAP. 

Six pounds soda, four pounds lime, four gallons water. 
Mix in the pot till quite hot, but do not let it boil. Let this 
settle. Put in seven and a half pounds of grease, and let it 
simmer till soft. Then add the soda, lime, and water, and let 
it boil two hours, not longer. While boiling feed with soda 
water. Put in half a pint of salt fifteen minutes before the 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 289 

boiling is done. It must be stirred all the time while boiling. 
If the lime is very strong two and a half pounds will be enough. 
The sediment of the soda and lime will do for whitewash. 

HARD SOAP (without Boiling). 

Dissolve one box lye over night in seven pints of warm 
water, and in the morning add six pints liquid grease. Stir 
for three-quarters of an hour, all one way. Pour it into 
moulds, and cut it out the next day. A small piece of beef 
tallow added will make it finer. 

HARD SOAP. 

Put one box of saponifier into three gallons of water; 
knock off the end, and let the box boil until it empties itself; 
add four and a half pounds soap fat, and let it boil two hours 
and ten minutes. Then add a small half pint of salt, and 
let it continue boiling thirty-five minutes longer. Then add 
half a gallon of hot water, and let it come to a boil. Take 
the tub in which the soap is to be put, and pour a tumblerful 
of cold water round the sides and bottom of it to keep the 
soap from sticking. Let it stand all night, and cut it out in 
the morning. 

TO CURE A GATHERED BREAST. 

To half pint linseed oil add half pint brandy, a piece of 
castile soap as large as a walnut, a piece of mutton tallow and 
beeswax. Stew them together, and when cold spread it on 
brown paper, and apply it to the breast. To be kept on until 
all hardness is dispersed. Cocoa butter is very fine also.

TO EXTRACT THE SALT FROM LARD. 

For medicinal purposes, lard which is free from salt is often 
required. In order to extract the salt put a tablespoon ful of 
lard in a tin cup, and pour on it a pint of boiling water. Set 
it aside to get cold. The lard will be found in a cake on the 
top, and the salt which it contained will remain in the water. 

A PRETTY EXPERIMENT. 

An acorn suspended by a thread within half an inch of the 
water in a hyacinth glass will in a few months burst, and 
throw out a root, and shoot upward with straight and tapering 
stems, covered with beautiful green leaves. 

A PRETTY CENTRE PIECE. 

Take a goblet from which the stem has been broken off, and 
sew tightly round it a piece of coarse flannel, wet it, and put 
as much flaxseed on it as will stick to it. Place this in a 
saucer of water, and replenish it as often as it commences to 
dry up. The tumbler will soon be thickly covered with 
green, and is a very pretty ornament to a table. 

TO CLEAN WHITE SATIN SLIPPERS. 

White satin slippers can be cleaned by scrubbing well with 
a brush, castile soap, and rain water. Then put in the sun 
to dry, after stuffing the toes with cotton. 

COSMETIC SOAP. 

Take one pound castile soap, or any other nice old soap, 
scrape it fine, and put it on the fire with a little water. Stir 
till it is a smooth paste ; pour into a bowl ; when cold add 
lavender water or some kind of essence. Beat with a silver 
spoon till well mixed; thicken with corn meal, and keep in 
small pots. Cover tight, for the air will make the soap hard.

SCALDS OR BURNS. 

If a scald or burn is not deeper than the outer skin make 
an ointment of sulphur and lard stiff enough to spread on a 
cloth, or scraped Irish potato is good. 

CURE FOR A COLD.

TO SET COLORS IN CALICOES. 

Three gills of salt to four quarts boiling water. Put the 
dresses in while hot, and leave them till cold. Another way 
is, to take one teaspoonful of turpentine, and one of hartshorn, 
put in the quantity of water required to wash a dress. 

MORE ITEMS. 

A brass kettle should always be cleaned with a little salt 
and vinegar before using it. 

One pint lime, one pint salt, and three gallons of water will 
keep eggs for winter use. 

Stair rods can be cleaned by dipping a cloth in coal and 
rotten-stone, and rubbing them well. Then rub off with 
another cloth or a piece of paper. 

If you wash matting in salt and water it will keep it from 
turning dark. 

A NICE PAINT FOR PAVEMENTS. 
One gallon flour paste, not very thick, two pounds Vene- 
tian red. Mix this thoroughly, and apply it to the pavement 
with a whitewash brush. 

FLOOR POLISH THAT IS USED AT MT. VERNON. 

One pint of linseed oil, one of soft soap, one-half pint of 
turpentine, one-half pound of beeswax, two ounces of yellow 
ochre, if you want it light ; if dark, the same quantity of 
brown Spanish. Melt all together, stir well, apply hot with 
a woolen cloth. Rub hard and quickly immediately with a 
dry woolen cloth. Very fine. 

CURE FOR THRUSH, OR SORE MOUTH. 

Three tablespoonsful of honey, two teaspoonsful of bola- 
menia, one of borax, and half a teaspoon of burnt alum. Put 
all in an eggshell, and let it get hot. Do not stir it till it 
begins to rise in the shell, then stir it till it falls.

HOP POULTICE. 

Place a sufficient quantity of fresh hops to make two poul- 
tices in a saucepan, and add enough vinegar and water, in 
equal parts, to keep it from burning, so that when sufficiently 
hot for use the hops will only be moist. When ready to be 
put in the bag sprinkle in a little meal. Have the poultice 
a little warmer than the body, put it in the flannel bag, and 
as soon as cool replace it with another. A piece of flannel 
should be laid over the poultice to prevent the clothes from 
getting soiled. 

CAMPHOR BALL. 

Four tablespoonsful sweet oil, one hundred and twenty grains 
of white wax, one hundred and twenty grains spermaceti, six 
and a quarter grains camphor. Put all in a cup on the fire 
until dissolved. 

TO RESTORE COLORS. 

Hartshorn will restore colors taken out by acids. It may 
be dropped on any garment without injuring it. 

TO REMOVE SPOTS FROM CARPETS. 

Dissolve a small quantity of ammonia in some rain water, 
and wash the spots with it. 

TO TAKE MILDEW OUT OF LINEN. 

Rub the spots well with soap, then rub in well some scraped 
chalk. Lay the article upon the grass, and when dry renew 
the soap and chalk. This will remove mildew in two applica- 
tions. Javille water will remove most any stain, but it must be 
washed at once. 

ANOTHER RECIPE. 

Rub over the spots the juice of a raw tomato, and then 

sprinkle them with salt. Lay the article in the sun, and 

repeat the application until the spots disappear. This is 
almost infallible.

TO REMOVE SPOTS IN FURNITURE. 

Spots may generally be removed by rubbing them quick and 
hard with flannel wet with the same thing which made the 
stain. The very best restorative is pulverized rotten-stone and 
linseed oil. 

TO DESTROY BED-BUGS. 

Add one ounce quicksilver to the whites of two eggs well 
beaten, and apply with a feather. If the vermin are in the 
walls fill up the cracks with verdigris, green paint. 

TO RESTORE COLOR TO IVORY-HANDLED KNIVES. 

When they become yellow rub them with nice emery or sand 
paper. It will effectually restore their whiteness and take out 
the spots.

To inhale the fumes of slacked lime is an excellent remedy 
in diphtheria. Put some lime in a teacup, and with a funnel 
inhale it. 

FOR WHOOPING COUGH. 

Take about half an ounce chestnut leaves to one pint water. 
Let it come to a boil, then pour the whole into a teapot with- 
out straining. Drink occasionally either cold or warm as 
much as the patient will through the day and at bedtime. 
Children like it even without sugar, which it is best not to 
use. It may be given also to infants. Burn a cresoline lamp 

always at night. 

CHALK MIXTURE. 

To half a pint arrow-root gruel put half an ounce prepared 
chalk, one teaspoonful powdered cinnamon, brandy and sugar 
enough to make it pleasant. The child should eat it fre- 
quently when the bowels are disordered. 

FOR EAR ACHE. 

Take a clove of garlic or onion and toast it till it is soft. 
Then dip it in sweet oil and insert it in the ear. In a short 
time the pain will cease. Then insert some cotton to keep 
out the cold. 

CURE FOR A COUGH. 

Take one package each of boneset, horehonnd, mullen, and 
yarrow; boil them in two quarts of water. Strain it, and 
add one pound brown sugar, and boil to a syrup. Dose. 
One tablespoonful as often as required. 

TO CURE A CONSUMPTIVE COUGH. 

One gill of gum turpentine, one quart of Holland gin, one- 
half pint of clear honey. Mix well, stand twenty-four hours. 
Dose. Take six (or more if necessary) teaspoonsful a day. 
I have seen some wonderful cures from using this.

SORE EYES. 

For inflamed or weak eyes bathe them in a weak solution 
of salt and water, just sufficiently strong to taste slightly 
saline, and to be sensible to the eye. If there is much pain 
add a few drops of laudanum or Pond's Extract. 

PRICKLY ASH. 

Pour three pints boiling water on one ounce prickly ash, 
and boil it down to a quart. Let it cool, then strain it, and 
add a pint of the best whiskey. Commence with half a wine- 
glass half an hour before each meal, and increase the dose to 
a wineglassful. Excellent remedy for cough. 

TONIC TO PREVENT CHILLS. 

One pint whiskey, half a pint water, three ounces Peruvian 
bark, fifteen drops of oil of cloves, forty drops of Fowler's 
Solution. Dose. Three-quarters wineglassful for thirty days, 
before breakfast. This is excellent. 

TO CURL TUMBLED FEATHERS. 

Hold them over the heated top of the stove, not near enough 
to burn ; withdraw, shake them out, and hold them over it 
again until curled. 

TO CLEAN STRAW MATTING. 

Wash with a cloth, dipped in clean salt and water, then wipe 
dry at once. This prevents from turning yellow. 

FLOOR STAIN. 

One pound of burnt umber ground in oil ; mix this with 
boiled linseed oil, enough to color well without thickening the 
oil. Rub this mixture well into the wood with a woolen cloth, 
wiping with another cloth until the stain ceases to come off. 
Mix one gallon of turpentine with one pound of wax, shaved

TO MAKE THE BEST TEA. 

Scald your teapot, then allow a teaspoon ful for every two 
cups ; have the water boiling on the table, put the tea in the 
pot, then add the boiling water. Let it steep about five min- 
utes. Sliced lemon and sugar for those that prefer it, but 
true lovers of good tea never take lemon, and often no sugar. 
Some persons prefer cream with it. 

TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. 

Half cup rain water or very soft spring water, one tea- 
spoonful borax, one tablespoon spirits of wine. Squeeze the 
lace through this three times, then rinse in a cup of hot water, 
in which a black kid glove has been boiled. Pull out the 
edges of the lace until almost dry ; then press it for two days 
between the leaves of a heavy book. 

TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD. 

Bind the cut with cobwebs and brown sugar, press it on 
like lint, or, if you cannot procure these, with the fine dust of 
tea. When the blood ceases to flow apply laudanum. 

COLOGNE WATER.

FOR CHILDREN TEETHING. 

Tie a quarter of a pound of best wheat flour in a thick 
cloth, and boil it in one quart of water for three hours. If 
water boils away add more. Then remove the cloth, and ex- 
pose the flour to the air or heat until it is hard and dry. 
Grate from it, when wanted, one tablespoonful, which put 
into half a pint of new milk, and stir over the fire until it 
comes to a boil, when add a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful 
of cold water and serve. Or, brown a tablespoonful of flour 
in the oven, feed a few pinches at a time to a child, or mix 
with water and give it. Will stop summer complaint in 
children often when everything else fails. 

MAIDS OF HONOR. 

There are some delightful little cakes, fit for the gods, or at 
any rate for afternoon tea, which go by the quaint name 
" maids of honor." 

At one Fifth-avenue mansion they are considered a great 
delicacy. The recipe, by the way, has been in this family for 
generations. It descended possibly from the time of Queen 
Elizabeth ; the making of these cakes was one of the occupa- 
tions of the virgin Queen's ladies in waiting. 

The night previous to making these cakes cut a piece of 
rennet about four inches square, wash off the salt carefully, 
wipe the rennet dry, and put it in a cup of warm water to soak. 
Early in the morning stir the rennet water into a quart of 
milk and set it in a warm place until the milk becomes firm, 
and put on ice ; when quite cold, put the curd into a sieve and 
drain it dry, crumbling it fine in your hands. Have ready two

Grate upon lumps of loaf sugar the yellow rind of three 
lemons, then squeeze the juice of the lemons over the sugar 
and let it dissolve. Mix in a deep pan the crumbled curd, 
with three-quarters of a pound of butter cut up and three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar. Stir the curd, the 
butter and the sugar together till very light, adding a wine- 
glass of brandy, the almonds and the lemon, also grate in a 
small nutmeg. Beat well together the yolks of eight eggs, 
then add gradually to the other ingredients, finishing with a 
tablespoonful of farina and beat the whole thoroughly. Have 
ready some puff paste, with which you line small patty pans, 
then fill with the mixture, and sift powdered sugar over each 
cake. Put in a hot oven and bake thoroughly. 

BUTTERLESS SAUCE. 

Scald half a gill of milk ; mix half a pint of powdered

The best of all rules for successful housekeeping, and mak-

bane and pest of domestic economy, a perpetual plague, vexa-

To clean the railing of banisters, wash off all the dirt with 
soap and water, and when dry rub with two parts of linseed

jectionable, use two parts of sweet or cotton-seed oil and one 
part of alcohol, but the mixture of linseed oil and turpentine 
is more desirable. 

Mothers are nearly always to blame if the baby's ears stick

down over the ears and tied securely under the chin, answers 
the same purpose. 

By putting lace handkerchiefs in warm water in which are 
a few drops of ammonia, and using castile soap, they are 
easily washed and made a beautiful, clear white. Then do 
not iron, but spread the handkerchief out smoothly on marble 
or glass, gently pulling out or shaping the lace. Just before 
it is entirely dry, fold evenly and smoothly and place under a 
heavy weight of some kind, and you will find handkerchiefs 
lasting thrice as long as before. 

Irons are pretty sure to gather rust this weather and cause 
a good deal of bad temper in the laundry. Heat them hot, 
then run them forcibly over a flannel cloth that has a liberal 
sprinkling of salt on it. This will remove every bit of the

a greased cloth or a cloth that has a little white wax or bees- 
wax on it, then treat it to a vigorous rubbing on a perfectly 
clean white cloth. 

If the top of the oven insists on being too hot for pastry or 
bread, put a pan of water on the grate above the bread that 
is baking too brown. If the grate has been removed to make 
room, take a big sheet of the common brown wrapping paper, 
fold it and lay over the bread or pies or whatever it may be. 
If that is not at hand use a newspaper. Fold it to as many 
thicknesses as necessary. The thicker it is the more protec- 
tion it will aiford from the too-hot oven. Of course, it will 
brown and crisp, but you have only to be careful about slip- 
ping it out when it has answered its purpose. 

For shampooing get five cents' worth of powdered castile

is more beneficial to the hair than brushing, as the latter 
seems to make it come out more > but, like everything else,

each individual. 

A very pretty work a great many energetic women are try- 
ing now is that of making their own bead portieres. The 
Japanese shops sell bamboo and strings of beads, so that one 
can make curtains to harmonize perfectly with each room. 
For instance, I saw a charming effect produced by a portiere 
of green beads used between a dining-room and a small con- 
servatory adjoining. You have no idea how exquisite the 
plants and flowers looked through this transparent screen of 
green. Gold beads give a sunshiny effect, and portieres of 
solid pink or blue beads are dainty in the extreme. A friend 
who has recently returned from Japan tell me that the cur- 
tains strung in patterns are made by having the designs drawn 
on large pieces of paper and laid on the floor, and then the 
beads are strung on just as we would trace out the lines in 
making lace. 

When you are paring apples for sauce or pastry, wash them 
well first. Take the parings and cores, and put them in a 
pan of water on the stove, and cook till all are tender. Then 
squeeze the juice through a jelly cloth, and put it in a wide- 
mouthed jar, with a pound of sugar and a gill of good liquid 
yeast to a gallon of juice. Let the liquid stand near a warm 
stove for a month, the mouth of the jar covered with a thin 
cloth, so that the air can get to the liquid, and bugs and flies 
cannot. By that time you will have a gallon of splendid 
vinegar. Pour off a third or more of it in another jar, to 
settle, and after add to the first jar the juice of your fruit 
parings every day if you like, pouring off a part of it every 
week or two, for immediate use. In that way you can keep 
a perpetual supply on hand, and you can be sure that it will

BEIGNETS d'ABRICOTS. 

Make a batter as follows : The whites of three eggs beaten 
lightly and two tablespoonsful of potato flour, with the same 
quantity of powdered sugar and an ounce of melted butter 
well mixed together. If too stiff, add a small cupful of milk. 
Make the batter some time before it is required for use. The 
apricots should not be too ripe; they need not be skinned, 
but should be cut in quarters, and the stones removed. Well 
cover each piece with the batter and drop them into clear 
boiling fat, fry to a light golden brown, drain, cover with 
powdered sugar and serve hot. 

Beignets of peaches, apples, and oranges are made with the 
same batter. Apples are pared and cored, then cut through 
to make rings (oranges are divided by the natural divisions). 
French cooks add a little olive oil to the batter, in place of 
butter, and water instead of milk. The specialty of the batter 
thus made is that it clings to whatever is immersed in it and 
swells into crisp coating. 

GREENGAGES GLACES. 

Boil half a pound of lump sugar with a tumblerful of water. 
Throw into the syrup some ripe greengages. Let them cook 
in this until they show signs of breaking, when take them 
out. Boil the syrup again until it is half reduced in quantity. 
When it has become cold, dip each greengage into it to be- 
come thoroughly coated, and roll them in castor sugar. Set 
them out separately on sheets of white paper.

"bear/ 7 place a mixed row of ripe raspberries, currants,

until the mould is full. When quite solid, stand the mould 
in hot water for a minute, to enable it to turn out well, put 
a little water also inside the jam jar, that you may slip it 
easily out of its place. Turn the jelly out on a glass dish 
and fill up the centre with a little cream whipped with white

off, if there is too much for a nice gravy ; add a good-sized 
lump of butter, pepper, and salt, and a cupful of rich cream ; 
a teaspoonful of flour rubbed with the butter. Serve hot with 

slices of lemon. 

BEST TEA PUNCH. 

Two pints strong green tea freshly made, one quart bottle 
champagne, half pint cura9oa, half pint brandy, the grated 
rind of two lemons and the juice of three, a large orange, 
sliced, taking out the seeds. Sweeten to taste. Either freeze 
or serve with crushed ice. 

HOW TO CROWN SOUPS. 

Take quarter pound brown sugar and put it in a pan over 
the fire. Let it melt and add about a pint of water. Let it 
boil, and allow an ironspoonful to a tureen of soup ; a little 
sugar improves soup. This will keep in a bottle corked tight. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BOILING. 

Always have the water boiling hot for puddings, and keep 
it boiling, don't let it stand. Always immerse any meat to 
be boiled in boiling water. Poultry is much improved by 
soaking several hours in skimmed milk, as it makes them 
white. Let them simmer over the fire a long time, keeping 
them closely covered. A small piece of bacon and some 
parsley put inside of the fowl improves it. Some like an 
onion. A good-sized turkey must boil two hours and a 
half; chickens, if young, one hour and a half. Always 
have the water boiling hot for fish. They do not take 
long to boil, and you can ascertain when they are done as 
then the bones leave them easily. 

PUMPKIN PRESERVE. 

Ten lemons, half a pound ginger, green or dried, to twelve 
pounds of fruit. Three-quarters pound of sugar to one pound

until thick, then put in tin cans and seal hot. Very fine. 

PARFAIT AUX PRAISES. 

Press a quart of fresh strawberries through a fine sieve. 
Sprinkle over fine pulverized sugar to taste. Whip in a bowl 
with an egg whisk a quart of double cream until it is a stiff 
froth ; stir in the strawberry pulp ; put in mould and pack 
away in ice, without further stirring. 

Parfait of peaches, raspberries or bananas, made in the 
same way. 

STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 

Boil one quart of sugar in two quarts of water half an hour, 
making a syrup. Let it get quite cold. Mash three boxes 
(a short three quarts), of strawberries, so that all the straw- 
berries are broken and they are mashed rather fine. Add the 
cold syrup ; freeze, stirring hard half an hour. If two or three 
quarts, are made, the cylinder form of the ice cream machine 
looks very well. In this case, take out the dasher when the 
cream is frozen and smooth the cream into shape at top, when 
packing away ; or, the cream can be packed away, pressed into 
another mould. Serve with whipped cream around the mould. 

Raspberry Ice Cream, made as last receipt, is especially 
good. 

FELICIA'S APPLES. 

Pare and take out cores of good cooking apples, leaving 
them whole. Boil them in sweetened water. When the apples 
are done, take them out and let the water boil down to half

quantity. Flavor with anything (Felicia's mixed lemon and 
vanilla extracts, half and half), and add a little corn starch to 
thicken slightly. Pour this over the apples, or dish in 
which they are to be served. Bake in oven giving a little 
color. Serve with cream. 

STUFFED PEPPERS. 

Take either green or red peppers, cut off the top, scoop out 
the inside. Chop up some veal very fine, add salt, a little of 
the inside of the peppers, some butter, chopped parsley and a 
little cream. Stuff the peppers with this, put a little lump of 
butter on top and a few cracker crumbs. Heat thoroughly 
and serve hot on a napkin. 

BONED TURKEY. 

To bone a turkey, lay the bird on its breast on the table, 
and with a sharp knife make a clean cut down the length of 
the back. Without cutting through the skin cut towards and 
disjoint the wings. Then cut towards and disjoint the thighs, 
leaving the wing and thigh bones in the flesh. Now proceed 
to cut all the flesh from the carcass of the bird, keeping it 
entire and being careful not to cut through the skin. When 
it is all removed lay its skin down upon the table and take 
out the wing and thigh bones without cutting through the skin. 

GALANTINE OF TURKEY. 

For galantine of turkey put the carcass over the fire in four 
quarts of cold water, with a bouquet of herbs, an onion, 
peeled and stuck with ten cloves, a carrot and turnip, peeled, 
and bring it to a boil, skimming it clear. Either make a 
forcemeat of one pound each of fresh veal and pork, finely 
minced, or use an equal quantity of nice sausage-meat un- 
flavored with sage, or chicken may be used. Season the 
forcemeat highly with a teaspoonful of mixed ground cloves, 
nutmeg, mace and allspice, a teaspoonful of salt and a salt- 



SUNDRIES. 311 

spoonful of pepper. Add to it a glass of sherry or madeira 
wine and one raw egg for each pound of the forcemeat, also 
one-quarter of a pound of larding pork, the same amount of 
cold tongue, cut in one inch dice, and mix it thoroughly. Lay 
the flesh of the turkey on the table skin down ; put the force- 
meat on it and fold the turkey up over it in the form of the 
bird. Roll it tightly in a strong clean cloth, tie it with tape 
in the centre and near the ends of the roll ; fasten the ends 
firmly with strong twine, taking care to make the roll compact 
and secure. Put the turkey into the water containing the 
carcass, and boil it slowly for three hours, replenishing the 
stock with boiling water, so as to have the turkey entirely 
covered with it. When the turkey has boiled three hours take 
it up, remove the cloth, wash it in cold water and tie the 
turkey up again in it ; put it between two platters under a 
heavy weight, and let it stand over night to cool. Strain the 
stock in which it was boiled, and let that stand over night so 
that all the fat can be removed. Remove all the fat, put the 
stock over the fire, add to it two ounces of gelatine dissolved 
in a pint of cold water, and clarify it as for consomme. Strain 
it through flannel until perfectly clear; pour it into two shal- 
low moulds ; color one dark brown with caramel, and cool 
until the jelly is firm. Lay the galantine, or boned turkey, 
on a dish, and garnish it with the jelly cut in fanciful shapes. 
Serve it cold. 

ORANGE OMELETTE. 

For orange omelette grate the yellow rind and squeeze the 
juice of one orange; beat the yolks of three eggs to a cream 
and add the orange rind and juice to them, with two teaspoons- 
ful of powdered sugar; beat the whites to a stiff froth. 
Meantime have a clear, smooth frying-pan on the fire heating, 
with a piece of butter as large as a chestnut. When the pan 
is hot put the omelette into it, lift it constantly from the 
bottom of the pan with a fork, piling it in the middle. When 
it seems nearly done pile it at one side of the pan ; hold a hot 



312 SUNDRIES. 

dish close to it, and turn it out lightly and quickly. Dust it 
with powdered sugar and serve at once. 

OMELETTE SOUFFJLEE. 

For omelette soufflee mix to a cream three ounces of 
powdered sugar, the yolks of two eggs and a teaspoonful of 
vanilla essence ; beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth ; 
gently stir the yolks and sugar into the whites ; put the mixture 
by the tablespoonful on a buttered gratin dish or souffle'e pan 
and bake it golden brown in a moderate oven, dusting it 
with powdered sugar when it is half done; serve it the 
instant it is done or it will fall. 

BARBECUED HAM. 

Put into the dish one tablespoonful of butter, one of tomato 
catsup, one of wine. When boiling, put in one thin slice of 
boiled ham. As soon as boiling hot, serve. 

CHINESE EGGS. 

Cut hard-boiled eggs into thin slices ; put one tablespoon- 
ful of butter in the dish with one tablespoonful of flour; mix 
and add a half-pint of milk ; stir until boiling ; add egg, half 
teaspoonful salt, dash of pepper ; when hot, serve. 

SAUTED OYSTERS. 

Drain twenty-five fat oysters, put one tablespoonful butter 
in chafing-dish, when hot turn in the oysters. When gills 
curl season with salt and pepper and serve. 

CURRY OF OYSTERS. 

Put one tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful curry pow- 
der, one of onion juice in the dish ; when hot add twenty- 
five oysters, and three tablespoon sful stock. When boiling, 
serve. 



SUNDRIES. 313 



LOBSTER NEWBURG. 

Cut a boiled lobster into pieces about one inch square. 
Put into the chafing-dish one tablespoonful butter, one table- 
spoonful flour, mix. Beat yolks of two eggs, add one gill of 
cream, stir until boiled ; add lobster, heat, season, add four 
tablespoonsful sherry and serve. Chicken, shrimp and terra- 
pin may be served same. 

BAKED TOMATOES WITH CORN. 

Scoop out the inside of tomatoes as for a " farci," cutting 
out a small round piece at the stem end. Remove the seeds 
and replace the pulp with some corn grated from the cob and 
well seasoned with butter, pepper and salt. Bake in a 
pudding dish and send them to the table in the same dish 
when well browned. 

HOW TO PREPARE POTATOES. 

Potatoes go very nicely with fish, and this is the way to 
prepare peeled or boiled potatoes : Thoroughly wash the 
required number of potatoes and peel them very thin, and lay 
them in cold salted water ; while the potatoes are being peeled, 
put some water in a saucepan over the fire, with a level tea- 
spoonful of salt to about a quart of water ; after the potatoes 
are peeled, put them into the boiling water and boil them 
until they are tender enough to be pierced easily with a fork ; 
then drain them, put over them a clean towel folded several 
times, set the saucepan on a brick on the back of the stove, 
where the potatoes will keep hot without burning, and let 
them stand until they are required for use. 

BAKED SWEETBREADS. 

Blanch some sweetbreads as already directed ; score them 
deeply on the top, lay them in a buttered baking-pan, season 
them with salt and pepper and squeeze over two or three the 



314 SUNDRIES. 

juice of a sour orange, quickly brown them in a hot oven ; 
transfer them to a hot dish, pour over them the drip- 
pings from the pan, and garnish them with sour orange 
slices ; serve them hot. 

HOW TO BROIL A BEEFSTEAK. 

First scrape the surface of the steak with the back of a 
knife to remove any bits of bone remaining after cutting it ; 
then trim off the tough outer skin and all gristle and excess 
of fat, the natural proportion of fat being about one-third the 
steak ; wipe the steak with a damp cloth, but do not wash it, 
because that would detract from its flavor and nutriment ; 
place the steak on a gridiron, close to a very hot fire, and 
quickly brown on both sides. When it is brown on both 
sides season it with salt and pepper, and finish cooking it to 
the desired degree. About fifteen minutes at a very hot fire 
will cook a steak an inch and a half thick, medium rare ; 
twenty to twenty-five minutes will cook it moderately well 
done. When it is done to desired degree put it on a hot 
platter, season it with salt, pepper and butter, and serve it 
at once. 

FRIED BEEFSTEAK. 

Follow first the directions given in the recipe for broiled 
beefsteak for preparing the steak for cooking. Put over the 
fire a frying-pan, and let it get hot enough to sizz when the 
steak is put into it. Put the steak into the pan, set it over 
the hottest part of the fire and brown it as fast as possible, 
first on one side and then the other. When the steak is brown 
on both sides, move the frying-pan to where the steak can 
cook to the desired degree without burning. When the steak 
is done transfer it to a hot dish, season it with salt, pepper and 
butter, and serve it at once. A steak cooked in this way has 
all its juices preserved, and in some respects is nearly as good 
as a broiled steak. This method of cooking a beefsteak is 



SUNDRIES. 315 

often desirable, because an open, broiling fire is not always 
available. 

PINEAPPLE PUDDING. (Fine.) 

Line a dish with rich pastry, peel and grate a large pine- 
apple; weigh the pineapple after it is grated and allow an 
equal weight of sugar and half the weight of butter. Mix 
the butter and sugar to a cream, beat in the yolks of five eggs, 
then add the grated pineapple and half a pint of cream ; last 
of all, beat the five whites to a stiif froth, mix them lightly 
with the other ingredients, put the mixture into the pastry- 
lined dish, and bake the pudding in a moderate oven until the 
pastry s done. Serve it hot. 

SHADDOCKS FOR LUNCHEON. 

Cut in baskets, keep the baskets in the ice chest until wanted. 
Fill a short time before serving with small pieces of the inside 
(freed from the partition skins), sweetened. Just before serv- 
ing partly cover the tops with small pieces of ice and a spoon- 
ful of Maraschino. It is very good without liquor. Tie a 
little bunch of flowers or leaves at side of handle with ribbon. 

TIMBALE OF BEEF, 
OR ANY OTHER MEAT VENISON, VEAL, ETC. 

One pint of meat pulp put through the machine five or six 
times, or sieve if one has no machine. Cook to a paste one 
cupful milk and a scant cupful of bread crumbs. Beat 
very light three whole eggs together, mix all together, and 
put through sieve; season with salt and pepper, and fry 
in pans with a little onion. 


SARDINE FRITTERS. 

Drain from the fishes as much of the oil in which they were 
preserved as you can. Carefully remove the skins and the 
backbone; if large divide in two; otherwise replace the 



316 SUNDRIES. 

halves after taking out the bone, sprinkle a little lemon juice 
and cayenne over them, and dip into a light frying batter 
allow a small dessertspoonful for each fish. Fry in boiling 
fat, drain on blotting paper, and serve at once with a garnish 
of parsley. 

SAUSAGE ROLLS. (From Mrs. President Harrison.) 

Take half a pound of sausages, parboil them and remove 
the skins, and cut each sausage in two. Take some good light 
paste, roll it out to an eighth of an inch thick, cut into 
square pieces, roll up the pieces of sausage in the paste, 
slightly moisten the edges and press the ends together ; brush 
the rolls over with the yolk of egg and bake in a quick oven. 
The remains of pressed beef, or roast beef and ham, seasoned 
with spice, pepper, salt, and a pinch of finely-chopped herbs, 
and then moistened with an egg and made into small rolls, 
can be substituted for the sausages. 

PRUNE PUDDING. 

Cook one cup of prunes until soft in as little water as pos- 
sible, and rub through a colander. Beat the whites of five 
eggs to a stiff froth and add to the prunes. Mix a half cup 
of sugar and a half teaspoonful of cream of tartar thoroughly 
and sift into the prunes. Put in a baking dish and bake a 
few minutes in a moderate oven to cook the egg. Serve with 
a custard made as follows : 

Custard. Put one pint of milk into a double boiler to scald. 
Beat the yolks of four eggs until light. Add to them two table- 
spoonsful of sugar. When the milk is scalded pour it into 
the egg mixture, then pour the whole back into the double 
boiler. Bring to the scalding point, remove from the stove 
and add one teaspoonful of vanilla. Stand away to cool. 

FIG LAYER CAKE. 

Put half a cup of sugar and one cup of water in a sauce- 
pan, stir until the sugar is dissolved, then add one pound of 



SUNDRIES. 317 

figs chopped fine. Stew all together until the mixture is soft 
and smooth. Take from the fire and cool. For the layers. 
Cream, half cup of butter, add very gradually one and a half 
cups of sugar, beating until the whole is light and creamy. 
Then add, little by little, one cup of water and two and a half 
cups of sifted flour. Beat thoroughly until all the flour is 
beaten in smoothly, then stir in two teaspoonsful of yeast 
powder. Have ready the whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Stir these in carefully and add one teaspoonful of 
flavoring extract. Bake in three layers. Spread the fig mix- 
ture between the layers and on top put an icing as follows : 

Gelatine Icing. Put one tablespoonful of gelatine in a bowl 
with one tablespoonful of cold water ; let it soak ten minutes. 
Add two tablespoonsful of boiling water ; stir until dissolved 
and add enough pulverized sugar to make it the proper con- 
sistency to spread. Flavor and spread the icing on the cake, 
then stand in a cool place to dry. 

NUT DROPS. 

Cream, half cup of butter, adding little by little one cup of 
sugar, beat well. Add half a cup of water, stir until well 
mixed, then add one egg well beaten. Sift two and a half 
cups of flour, add to the mixture and stir until smooth. Then 
add one cup of nuts chopped fine, stir them in thoroughly, 
and add one teaspoonful of yeast powder. Mix well ; drop 
on buttered tins and bake until brown. 

ECLAIRS. 

Put one cup of water into a saucepan, add two ounces of 
butter, and when it boils hard throw in one cup of flour. Stir 
rapidly until it forms a ball and leaves the sides of the pan. 
Take from the fire and stand aside to cool. When cold stir 
in four eggs, unbeaten, one at a time. Beat the whole vigor- 
ously. Put this batter into a pastry bag and press out on 
well-buttered tins, making the eclairs about five inches long 



318 SUNDRIES. 

and placing them two inches apart on the tins. Bake for about 
a half hour in a quick oven until perfectly light. Make an 
incision in one side and fill with the following mixture : 

Filling. Put one cup of milk in a double boiler. Beat four 
eggs and four tablespoonsful of sugar together until light, add 
one tablespoonful of cornstarch ; mix thoroughly. Stir into 
the scalding milk ; stir until the mixture is thick and smooth 
and stand aside to cool. Add one teaspoonful of vanilla just 
before filling the eclairs. 

Icing. Take two ounces of cocoa melted with two ounces 
of pulverized sugar and stir until it makes a paste. Dip the 
bottom of each eclair into this and set aside to harden. Eclairs 
may be filled with whipped cream or preserved fruits and iced 
with fruit icings if desired. 

RUM FRUIT. 

One quart of Jamaica rum, seven pounds fruit, seven pounds 
sugar. Put one pound strawberries in a stone jar, sprinkle 
over one pound granulated sugar, then pour over the quart of 
rum. Put a plate over the fruit to keep it under the rum. 
After three days put in another pound of fruit and another 
pound of sugar. Each time you add fruit stir from bottom 
with silver spoon. A nice combination strawberries, rasp- 
berries, currants, cherries (stoned), bananas, peaches and pine- 
apples. When finished pack in stone jars. 

SALMON SANDWICH. 

Spanish onions chopped fine, and mixed with twice the 
quantity of canned salmon, is a fine filling for a sandwich 
to be eaten at bedtime. Season with salt, red pepper, and a 
little vinegar. 

SARDINES. 

Sardines are excellent mixed with the chopped pulp and 
grated yellow rind of lemon. Season with pepper and salt 



SUNDRIES. 319 

and spread on hot toast or toasted crackers. Two lemons 
for one small can of sardines. 

A NEW WAY OF COOKING LIMA BEANS. 

If, when you are dining out, you receive lima beans that 
have a delicious yet unfamiliar flavor, you may conclude that 
they are cooked after a new fashioned recipe, with cocoanut 
milk and lemon juice. The beans are first boiled in the usual 
way, that is, rapidly in boiling water for a quarter of an hour, 
and then more slowly fifteen minutes longer, drained and 
cooled. After that the outer covering is removed without 
breaking the beans, and they are covered with cocoanut milk, 
and allowed to simmer eight minutes. Season just before 
dishing with salt to taste, a tablespoonful of butter, and a tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice. The milk is prepared by pouring a 
quart of boiling water over a grated cocoanut. Stir vigor- 
ously, and when the water begins to cool, squeeze and press 
out of the nut all the fatty substance possible. Strain through 
a cooking-napkin. Mrs. Gibson used the top layer of this 
milk, which is like a cream, for some salad-dressings. The 
milk beneath is the part used on the beans. 

AMATEUR SURGERY. 

There are times when a simple thing in amateur surgery 
goes a great way towards easing pain. On New England 
farms the women all know what to do with a cut or burned 
finger. 

The materials for the operation are always close at hand. 
Under the shell of every egg there is a white gelatinous film that 
is in itself a perfect skin. If the cut is not very large a piece 
of this film, fresh and wet, laid over the wound, will pre- 
vent soreness and in a great measure hasten the growth of 
the new skin. 

The film adheres closely, keeps out all foreign matter, and 
draws the edges of the wound together. It will not come off 



320 SUNDRIES. 

easily, and another advantage that women will appreciate is 
that it does not show. 

There is a woman in New York who has another simple 
remedy for cuts and burns. When a member of the family 
has a burn or cut she drags forth a bottle of shellac varnish 
and industriously paints the wound. The varnish, drying, 
acts in the same manner as the egg film, and at the same time 
is almost as invisible. The remedy is an old one in carpenter 
shops, and has been proved by use to be an efficacious one. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

In case you have no benzine or alcohol at hand cologne 
will be found just as effectual in removing grease spots. 

A delicious way of serving the common small chestnuts is 
to roast them, then shell, sprinkle with sugar and cover with 
rum, which must be lighted and allowed to burn until all the 
alcohol is consumed. 

Black lace will resume much of its pristine beauty if washed 
in thick suds made of tar soap. The lace must be allowed 
to dry without rinsing, as the tar imparts a slight stiffness, 
which is very desirable. 

Crackers prepared as follows are nice to serve with soup or 
bouillon or for a Sunday night tea. Saltines or water crackers 
should be slightly buttered, sprinkled with grated cheese and 
thoroughly browned in the oven. 

Home-made marrons glaces may be prepared by boiling the 
chestnuts until thoroughly cooked, then dipping them into a 
syrup of sugar and water, such as is used for crystallizing 
cherries and walnuts. 

Cinnamon almonds are new and delicious, and are made 
the same as the salted nuts, omitting, of course, that con- 
diment. 

Soapsuds are said to be excellent for making plants grow 
and blossom, on account of the potash contained therein. 



SUNDRIES. 321 



GOOD WHITEWASH. 

When oil paint cannot be afforded for fences and outhouses, 
a good whitewash will look well and durable. The following 
wash is excellent. 

Take a clean barrel that will hold water. Put into it half 
a bushel of quicklime, and slake it by pouring over it boiling 
water sufficient to cover it four or five inches deep, and stir- 
ring it until slaked. When quite slaked, dissolve it in water, 
and add two pounds of sulphate of zinc, which may be had at 
any of the druggists, and one of common salt, and which in a 
few days will cause the whitewash to harden on the woodwork. 
Add sufficient water to bring it to the consistency of thick 
whitewash. 

To make the above wash of a pleasant cream color, add 
three pounds yellow ochre. 

For fawn color add four pounds umber, one pound Indian 
red, one pound lampblack. 

For grey or stone color, add four pounds umber and twenty- 
one pounds lampblack. 

The color may be put on with a common whitewash brush, 
and will be found much more durable than common whitewash. 

A SURE CURE FOR CORNS OR BUNIONS. 

Keep them wrapped in oil silk all the time, so as to exclude 
all air. 

COMPLEXION WASH. 

If there should be any ladies who are afflicted with any de- 
fect of their complexion, they may make a wash which should 
be applied morning and evening. It is not immediate in 
giving a white, painted look, but a week's use of it will prove 
that it is better than any of the so-called beautifiers. Take 
one fluid ounce tincture benzoin, and turn it slowly into eight 
ounces of rose water, shaking it all the time. Then take one 
ounce pure glycerine and one teaspoonful of borate of soda 
21 



322 SUNDRIES. 

and stir them together, adding one ounce of emulsion of bitter 
almonds. Stir these well together, and add them slowly to 
the rose water and benzoin, shaking all well. If this should 
smart the skin, add water to it until it does not. This is the 
famous Egyptian wash known and esteemed so highly, and is 
most excellent. The face, neck, hands and arms should be 
washed with tepid water and rubbed dry. This, then, should 
be applied with a sponge all over, letting it dry on the skin. 
It will leave a soft, clear, satiny surface, smelling deliciously 
refreshing and pleasant. Wrinkles and discolorations disap- 
pear gradually, and even pittings, as there is a peculiar process 
going on as long as it is used. The application forms a sort 
of transparent varnish on the skin, which cracks and peels off 
in microscopic particles, not visible to the eye, and each bit 
that comes off carries just so much of the outer skin with it, 
and so, imperceptibly, a delicate new skin is exposed, and the 
old clogged pores are set free and the sluggish circulation in 
the face is invigorated, and six months' conscientious use of 
this will restore to the most faded woman a fresh and bloom- 
ing complexion, without the use of any cosmetic. Some ladies 
might not like the polished smoothness it gives, but such 
could dust a little rice powder or Steamier powder over it. 
Many gentlemen have found it a very soothing and refresh- 
ing application after shaving. A bottle of the proportions 
mentioned above would cost, made up by a druggist, about 
one dollar, and it would last a year, and prove invaluable all 
the time for moths, freckles, tan, sunburn and chapped skin, 
to say nothing of wrinkles and that general withered look that 
is so annoying to those who care for their appearance. Its 
emollient and healing qualities are remarkable.

A Woman's Life 

to be happy must be a healthy one. The many causes of ill health 
need not be enumerated here, but suffice to say that thousands of 
women living to-day who were broken down either from diseases 
peculiar to their sex raising children overworked, or worn out by 
the multitude of household annoyances, were cured by the great 
strengthening medicine, Brown's Iron Bitters it is pleasant to 
take will not stain or injure the teeth as all other iron medicines 
will. Brown's Iron Bitters is specially recommended for weak 
and suffering women, nursing mothers and weak and puny children. 
Have you never tried it for yourself ? 

White Plain*, Oa., June 29, 1894. 

About nine or ten years since I was broken down in health and suffered from Extreme 
Nervousness. Also, about that time severe neuralgic pains would afflict different mem- 
bers of my body; sometimes the pain would be in my eyes and head, sometimes in my 
hands, and often in my shoulders and neck. I used many remedies but found none so 
good as Brown's Iron Bitters. I have used a few bottleseach year since then, always with 
good effect. I have often advised others to take the Bitters, and know of seven different 
families who use and praise Brown's Iron Bitters from having my experience given them. 

Yours truly, 

MRS. VILLA H. MAPP.

Cresta Blanca 
^ouvenir Vintages. 




HIGHEST AWARD WHEREVER EXHIBITIONS 
HAVE BEEN HADE. 



BLANCA is situated a few miles south of 
the town of Livermore, Alameda County. 

It was specially selected on account of soil and climatic 
conditions which gave promise of the highest possible 
excellence in wines of the Sauterne and Claret types. No 
mistake was made in this selection, for to-day Cresta 
Blanca wines compare favorably with the finest vintages 
of France and are served to the guests of all the leading 
hotels, restaurants and clubs on the Pacific Coast. 

Only a limited quantity is made annually. No expense 
is spared in the making and care of the wines, and when 
ready for consumption they are carefully bottled. 

Parties ordering these wines should see that the words 
CRESTA BLANCA are on every bottle. A new brand of 
wine has lately been put on the market and is being sold 
by one of the leading grocers and other unprincipled 
parties as Cresta Blanca or Wetmore's wines. Such wines 
should be refused if Cresta Blanca wines are ordered. 

All orders should be sent to

Westport=on=Lake Champlain. 

This pretty village lies on the slope of the natural terrace which encircles the great 
Northwest Bay, on the New York shore of Lake Champlain. This place has been known 
for many years as the eastern gateway of the Adirondacks, the great highway leading 
through Elizabethtown and Keene Valley, to the Au Sable Ponds, Lake Placid, and the 
high peaks of the range. The Westport Inn, the Over-the-Way, the Gables.and the Elm 
Cottage are all attractively located and will accommodate one hundred and fifty guests. 
The parlor, music room, and fine large dining room of the Inn are airy and pleasant, 
the chambers and bath rooms thoroughly well furnished and the sanitary arrangements 
excellent. The service is most efficient, and the table is spoken of in the highest terms 
of praise. There is a good livery stable under the patronage of the Inn and many beau- 
tiful and picturesque drives. There are two tennis courts golf links will be added this 
season, and there is a boat house connected with the Inn. The wide piazzas command a 
fine view of the Adirondack foot hills in the west and the great chain of Green Moun- 
tains in the east. The Lake excursions are numerous, fine great steamers touching here 
four times daily, giving opportunity for trips to Ticonderoga. Crown Point and the Au 
Sable Chasm. The remarkable and unusual features of Westport are the wonderful 
supply of water and the health record, both of which are unsurpassed. The Westport 
Mountain Spring bursts from the side of the range at the rate of one million gallons a 
day and is noted for its temperature and purity. 

ROUTES TO AND FROM WESTPORT. 

Westport is very accessible, it being only eight hours from New York via the N. Y. 
Central and Del. & Hud. Railroads, also eight hours from Boston via Fitchburg & Cen. 
Vt. Railroads, and four hours from Montreal. The Inn will continue under the skilful 
management of Mrs. O. C. DANIELS, and will be open from June 1st to Oct. 15th. 

TERflS $3.00 to $4.00 a day. Weekly Rates, $12.00 to $21.00 according 
to location and time occupied. Apply for floor plans.
