IF YOU WOULD HAVE 
A FINE ROSE BED 

Five things observe with care : 

Whose plants you get, 

What plants you set, 

And How and When and Where. 



Five important questions, but who knows the right 
answer? We have it. All in a little book "How To 
Grow Roses." This book answers not only these five 
questions but almost every imaginable question you need 
think of about Roses. 

It has been written by a man who has been answering 
the questions about Roses from a hundred thousand cus- 
tomers in the past ten years. He knows what you will 
need to know to have success, and that is what he tells 
you in this book. (Price 10 cents.) 

Furthermore this firm also guarantees their roses to 
bloom for you. 

If you want a Star Rose Bed — write to

Guaranteed for 15 Years 
No More Roof

When you use Dickelman Extra — your roof troubles are over. Our 15-year guaranty- 
Stamped on every roll — and given to you in black and white protects you absolutely. It 
simply means that you will have no more roof expense — no more roof troubles — for at 
least 15 years after the date you purchase. Most 
likely you will never have to roof the same building 
again. 

DICKELMAN EXTRA 

Galvanized Metal Roofing 

We guarantee it for 15 years, but know it will last twice that long. 

We kiimv that our roofing which was put up 2j years ago is still in excellent 
tecnditiim — and should last 25 years longer. We do not simply tell you or promise 
i you our roofing will last for 15 years — we guarantee it. Ask your dealer about 
DICKELMAN EXTRA. If he doesn't sell it, write us at once for sample and 
our valuable roofing book — sent prepaid. Kuovi -u'/iywe ca.r\ ^-i/arantee o\xv roofing 
for 15 years while others make vague promises that mean nothing. 

The secret of the durability of Dickelman Extra lies in the wonderful system 
of galvanizing — and the high quality of the materials used. The metal sheet we 
use for a base is made by a special process which leaves it tough — yet pliable 
and open-grained. So the galvanizing material fills up the "pores" — and actu- 
ally becomes a part of the finished sheet. This prevents it from cracking — 

.scaling — wearing or rusting off.

ICE CREAMS, SHERBETS, ETC. 



HOW TO FREEZE. 

Get a good freezer and keep it clean. Use rich cream without 
gelatine or glaze, when it can be gotten; if not, rich fruits with 
milk are almost as satisfactory. Scald the milk or cream, and dis- 
solve the sugar while hot. Thin flavorings may be added before 
freezing; crushed fruits, nuls, etc., when partly frozen. Put in 
the mixture, fill around the sides with crushed ice and coarse salt 
in layers, using plenty of salt. Turn the crank slowly and steadily 
till it gets stiff; here put in the fruit or coarse flavoring, and turn 
till it becomes too hard. Take out the dasher, stir the cream 
thoroughly, and, if whipped cream is added, stir it through now. 
Cover the can, cork it tight, put a buttered strip of muslin around 
the joint, drain off the water, and repack with ice and salt over the 
top of the can ; cover the freezer with a heavy cloth, and let stand 
in a cool place from 1 to 2 hours to ripen, according to the ingre- 
dients of the cream. Jf wanted in moulds, fill them when ready 
to repack, and bury them in salt and ice the same way. 

Ices take longer to freeze, and will melt more quickly. Always 
hav<i them as stiff as possible before packing. When the dasher 
comes out, the beaten white of egg should be stirred in, if any is 
used. Frozen whipped creams require 3 or 4 hours to ripen, but 
only need to be packed, so they can be made without a regular 
freezer ; in severe Aj/inter weather it is only necessary to set the 
mould outdoors for several hours. 

ANGEL PARFAIT. 

Miss Beall Ewing. 

Put h cup sugar and i cup water in a saucepan on the fire.

put together with judgment, the ice will be good whether frozen 
successfully or not.

CANDIES. 



The common terms that are used to describe the stages of heat 
reached by the boiling sugar in candv making are the "thread" or 
"string," from 215° to 217° F. ; the" "soft ball," 238° ; the "hard 
ball," 248° ; and the "crack," about 50° higher. The test is made 
by dropping a teaspoonful of the syrup in cold water. The 
"thread" strings from the end of the spoon ; the "soft ball" will 
just keep its shape; the "hard ball" hardens, and the "crack" is 
brittle. At 350° F., the syrup becomes quite brown and smokes. 
This is the "caramel" stage. 

BARLEY SUGAR. 

Soak 1 pint barley over niyht ; in the morning simmer in more 
water until as clear as thin jelly; strain, add 1 pound white sugar 
and juice of 1 lemon; boil again till it reach the hard ball. Take 
from the stove, whip in the stiff white of 1 egg, and pour in 
buttered pans. When cold enough mark in squares. 

BONBONS. 

Bonbons are made of fondant, cooked or uncooked. Any 
flavoring or coloring desired may be added to the boiled fondant 
just before taking from the fire; and cocoanut, chopped nuts or 
chopped fruits may be worked in while yet soft. When well 
worked make up into small balls of any size or shape. Whole nuts 
or candied fruits are rolled in fondant, and all bonbons are put 
aside to ripen. They are then dipped in colored or white melted 
fondant, or in melted chocolate. 

To color the outside of bonbons, melt boiled fondant over 
boiling water, color and flavor as desired, drop the bonbons in 
one at a time, turn with a two tined fork until covered, remove 
with the fork, and drop on buttered paper to harden. For cover- 
ing with chocolate, melt Baker's chocolate over boiling water, and 
dip in the same manner. The chocolate mav be sweetened if 
preferred, or sweetened chocolate may be used. 

BURNT ALMONDS.

CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 



CANNED FRUIT5. 



Take fruit in good condition, clean and handle it carefully, 
use granulated sugar, have the jars clean, sterilized, whole, the 
tops and rubbers in the same condition, put the fruit in boiling 
hot and cover at once, and fruit will keep with much or little 
sugar. Keep in a cool, dark place. Canned vegetables are much 
more uncertain. If put in glass jars, it would be well to cover 
the glass. 

APPLES. 

Take bell flowers or equally good apples ; peel, core, and 
throw into cold water to keep from discoloring. Weigh the fruit 
and allow ^ as much sugar ; put the apples on the fire, pour over 
them boiling water, and let cook slowly till nearly done. Put the 
sugar on to boil with twice the quantity of water ; when boiling 
transfer the apples with a skimmer to the juice; add 1 lemon sliced 
to about 4 pounds of fruit ; boil until tender enough to pierce 
easily with a straw. Lift carefully with a silver spoon, and fill the 
heated jar standing in a pan of hot water on the stove. Do not 
stop the kettle from boiling. Fill the jar to the brim with the 
syrup, wipe clean, put the cover on instantly, and put aside out of 
a draft to cool. The next morning tighten the lids still more if 
possible. More apples may be boiled in the same water, but if any 
syrup is left it should be canned separately and fresh made. Do 
not put the lemon peel in the jars. 

Quinces may be added to the apples to mutual benefit, in the 
proportion of 1 to 4. . 

Apricots may be canned as apples, either with or without the 
stones. In the latter case, add a few kernels to the syrup. Omit

Blue1)crries. elderberries, lilack and red raspberries are canned 
like bkickberriea : ripe gooseberries and strawlierrics require twice 
as much sugar; otherwise they are canned like blackberries. If 
meant for table use all canned fruit should be sweetened to taste, 
as the berries themselves vary in different pickings. SauCe should 
have enough in the first jdace ; pies are improved by adding it 
fresh. 

CHERRIES. 

For table use do not stone ; for pies, stone the cherries, and in 
either case allow h pound sugar to 1 pound fruit, if sour cherries. 
If a sweet variety, use less sugar. Continue as with blackberries. 

CRANBERRIES. 

Wash and pick over the berries very carefully, stemming such 
as need it, and throwing out the soft ones. Fill the jars and pour 
in cold water till it overflows ; screw on the tops and let stand 24 
hours. Open the jars, pour off the water, fill again to overflowing 
with fresh water, and screw on the lids "for keeps." They may 
also be canned as stewed for the table. 

Green gooseberries and green currants, it is said, may be kept 
in the same way. 

CURRANTS. 

Can at any stage of ripeness or unripeness, if they have begun 
to be juicy. Stem the currants, and allow -4 their weight of sugar. 
Finish as blackberries. 

If currants are added to red raspberries it should be in the 
form of juice, using about i currants. Allow extra sugar for the 
juice, pint for pint. 

GRAPES. 

Take ripe grapes and snip off the stems close to the grapes 
without cutting the skins. Fill Mason jars with the fruit, and set 
on a board in the oven turning on the heat so as to heat through 
without breaking the skins. Make some grape juice as for jelly, 
have pint for pint of sugar hot, and when the juice comes to the 
boil, add the hot sugar, stir till dissolved only, boil a few moments 
till the scum can be removed. Take out the grapes a jar at a 
time, and fill the jar full with the juice, sealing at once. Plums 
may be canned whole the same way. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. 

Stem and wash the berries. If for sauce, allow pint for pint 
of sugar. If for pies, \ the amount is better. Finish as with 
blackberries. 

PEACHES. 

Pare and stone the peaches and throw them into cold water. 
Put half the weight in sugar on the fire with an equal quantity of 
water, and stir till the sugar is dissolved. Put in the peaches, 
bring quickly to the boil, skim, and let simmer slowly till tender.

FRUIT JELLIES 



Make jellv on a clear dav. Take the fruit just npe or a 
little under ripe. Do not pick it just after a rain, and do not 
wash unless sandv. Large fruits should be wiped clean, the de- 
caved spots removed, then cut in quarters or less, placed in a 
preserving kettle, and barelv covered with cold water. Cover the 
kettle and let cook slowly till soft. Stir occasionally to keep from 
burning. The small fruits should be picked over carefullv, placed 
in a stone jar inside a large preserving kettle, the kettle hllcd witli 
hot water as high as practicable, and kept filled with boiling water 
as fast as it boils away. Stir once in a while to heat the fruit 

\\'hen soft turn the fruit into a coarse flannel bag (first dipped 
in hot water and wrung drv), tie the bag. and hang it up till the 
juice all drains out. Do not squeeze the light colored jellies, or 
thev will be cloudv. When the juice quits dripping, squeeze dry 
for" a second grade of jelly. Measure the juice, put it over the 
fire in a preserving kettle, and bring it to a boil. Allow pint tor 
pint of sugar, and put it in earthen dishes where it will heat. 
When the juice boils, skim it well, add the sugar, stirring just 
enough to dissolve it quicklv. and boil without stirring tdl done. 
Put a little in a cold saucer, and if it jellies on top it is done. 
Or dip a spoon into the boiling syrup, and if the last drops cling 
to the spoon, while the bowl remains covered, it is done. Begin

testing ill 15 minutes unless it appears done earlier. The time 
depends somewhat upon the amount of water, and the thorough- 
ness of the previous cooking of the fruit. Skim well and take 
off the stove. 

Have the glasses ready, washed in hot water, and kept hot ; 
take the syrup out with a cup and liU them, pouring a little at 
a time in each. A silver teaspoon left in a glass while filling is 
a safeguard against cracking. Keep the glasses out of a draft 
until cold. The next day, if the jelly is set, cut white glazed 
paper to fit the inside of the glasses, dip in brandy and lay over 
the jelly. Or pour melted parafiin over it to the depth of \ an inch. 
Fasten on the tin tops and set away in a cool place. A trouble- 
some, but satisfactory top consists of white glazed paper, cut a 
little larger than the tops of the glasses, dipped in white of. egg, 
and pasted over with the hands. 

If the jelly is not firm in 24 hours, cover with paper or glass 
and set in the sun for several days. If still not jellied, boil it 
over. 

Some fruits make a "ropy" jellv. If some one of the reliable 
kinds is combined with an unreliable one, it will correct this. 
Grape, quince, apple and currant give no trouble. Apple, or rhubarb, 
makes a good base for the more expensive jellies, and also tones 
down too strong a flavor. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Wipe the apples, cut out spots, and cut into small pieces. Put

touching. Keep in a cool place. 

TO SALT ALMONDS. 

Shell the almonds, scald them and remove the skins. Melt a 
small lump of butter in a pan in the oven. Dry the almonds and 
put them in the butter stirring and turning as they brown. When 
a good golden brown, sprinkle considerable salt over them, and 
let stand until cold. Tlicn rub off the excess of salt. 

VAXILLA ESSENCE. 

Slice 1 pound best stick vanilla, and pound in a mortar with 
3 ounces lump sugar. Then put in a quart jar, fill up with the 
best alcohol, screw lid on tight, shake well, and it can be used 
in a day. It improves very much in strength with age. 

HOW TO COOK HUSBANDS. 

"Greenfield Hill Cook Book." 

A good many husbands are entirely spoiled by mismanage- 
ment in cooking, and so are not tender and good. Some women 
keep them too constantly in hot water; others freeze them; others 



ODDS AND EKDS. 305 

put tliein in a stew; otlicrs roast tlinii ; and others keep them con- 
stantly in a pickle. It cannot he supposed that any husband will 
he good and tender managed in this way, hut tiiey are really 
delicious when properly treated. 

In selecting your husband you should not be guided by the 
silvery appearance as in buying mackerel, nor by the golden tint, 
as if you wanted salmon. Be sure and select him yourself, as 
ta.stcs difi'cr. Do not go to <<he market for him as those Ijrought 
to the door are always best. It is far better to have none than 
not to learn how to cook them properly. It does not make so 
much dift'erence what you cook him in as how you cook him. 
Sec that the linen in which he is wrapped is white and nicely 
mended, with the required number of strings and buttons. Don't 
keep him in the kettle by force, as he will stay there himself if 
proper care is taken. If he splutter or hzz, do not be anxious ; 
some husbands do this. 

Add a little sugar in the form of what confectioners call 
"kisses", but no vinegar or pepper on any account. A little spice 
improves them, but it must be used with judgment. Do not try 
him with anything sharp to see if he is becoming tender. Stir 
hiiu gently the wliile lest he stay too long in the kettle and be- 
come flat and tasteless. If thus treated, you will find him very 
digestible, agreeing nicely with you : and he will keep as long as 
vou want. 



USEFUL HINTS IN HOUSEKEEPING. 



BORAX. 



1 part of liot water dissolves (J parts of borax. It makes a 
good wash for the hair or slvin, where the water is hard. Is 
good to wash combs and brushes, paint, blankets, etc. Laces may 
he washed by leaving in water with a little bora.x in several hours, 
and then rinsing without ruljbing. 

BURNS. 

Mix equal parts of wiiitc of egg and olive oil, spread over 
the burn, and bandage with a piece of old linen ; or dust thickly 
with baking soda, bandage, and keep the bandage wet. This will

COLD PROCESS SOAP. 

Mrs. G. O. Beery. 

Dissolve 1 ten cent can of Babbitt's potash and J pound pow- 
dered borax in 3 pints warm soft water. Melt 5 pounds of clean 
rendered grease. When the solution is cool, and before the grease 
becomes hot, pour the grease slowly into the potash and borax, 
stirring constantly until the mixture is like molasses, when it can 
he poured into the vessel to harden. Just before it hardens, add 
I- pint gasoline. 

CUCUMBER LOTION. 

Eresh cucumbers mashed to a pulp are good to spread over 
a sunburned face. Cucumber peelings boiled and cooled make a 
good wash for the complexion. 

ECZEMA CURE. 

Mix 3 sulphur with ^ cream tartar, and enough N. O. molasses 
to make it palatable. Take 1 teaspoon every morning for 9 morn- 
ings ; wait a week and take a second course. 

HAIR TONIC. 

Witch hazel rubbed well into the roots of the hair at niglit 
is an excellent tonic. So is sage tea or equal parts of quinine, 
whiskey and bay rum. Also loosening the hair and rubbing tlie 
scalp thoroughly with the hand brings excellent results. 

^ pint sage tea mixed with i pint bay ruin, ^ ounce tincture 
cantharides and 20 grains bisulphide of quinine is a good toniir 
also.
