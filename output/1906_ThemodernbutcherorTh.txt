PREFACE. 

The object of this book is to stop the '"guessing" in 
the meat business. No man should run his business on 
the guess-work plan. 

Every person in business should know at all times 
where he "is at," and more so in these days of high prices 
and unfair competition. The tables herein contained are 
accurate and can be relied upon. 

With a little care and study, you will be able to un- 
derstand the necessity of them. 

There are also many valuable receipts herein, which 
have been practically tested. 



INTRODUCTORY. 

In compiling this book, I have gone into the minutest 
details of the meat business, giving you the benefit of 
over 30 years' active eocperience, and outlining to you the 
secrets of success. Experience is the best and only 
teacher, but it has cost many a man a fortune, creeping 
along in the dark, until he could come out into the light. 
Mankind can always learn. They are never too old. The 
wisest can always be taught ; so do not die in despair ; 
there is yet a chance for you. 

This book is so arranged that in one minute you can 
see where you are at. It is a safe guard to your business 
as a lock is to your door, and contains all the information 
that is required by anyone, who has had some experi- 
ence in the business. 

The market fluctuates at all times, consequently 
you must keep with the market. The tables herein run 
from the lowest to the highest points of the market. 
When meat is cheap anyone can make money. When it 
is high they all lose. This should not be. They should 
at the least hold their own. 

Some men seem to think because they own their own 
building and do their own work that they are under but 
a very little expense, but you can rent your building and 
work out and draw a salary and let the other fellow do 
the worrying, aside from having thousands of dollars 
mvested. If the meat business is a legitimate business, 
the butcher is entitled to a legitimate profit. 

When live-stock goes up, the wholesaler advances 
the prices on all meats. As the cost advances, the retailer 
must advance the selling price. This you will find in 
every business. 



A successful man always buys a stock of goods when 
the market is down, and as the market advances, takes 
advantage of the raise in price. Some again have the bird 
in their hand and allow it to escape by giving their bar- 
gain away. 

Moral — "A bird in the hand is worth three in the 
bush." 

In making my calculations I have allowed for a 
reasonable amount of trimmings or waste. The question 
of shrinkage is hard to determine, as it all depends upon 
how long the beef has hung. You will notice how cheap 
meats can be sold when they are cheap, but there is no 
reasonable excuse for you to sell it at the low price when 
you can obtain more. You will also notice that when 
beef costs over 8 cents, that the retail price advances very 
rapidly, and that but a very few in the business get a 
price at that time which will warrant them in handling 
high-priced beef. 

This book is compiled as a safe-guard and should be 
consulted often. You will note that I have based my cal- 
culations on a gross profit of 20 percent. This profit 
must cover all your expense and leave you a margin be- 
sides. 

You will also notice that I have divided a side of 
beef as follows: 259 pound side of beef — hind quarter, 
125 pounds; front quarter, 134 pounds; this makes a dif- 
ference on the carcass of 18 pounds. There are but few 
cattle where the hind quarters and the front quarters 
weigh alike, and often the difference is as much as 30 
pounds and sometimes more, but they generally run from 
^2 to 20 pounds, so I have taken an average of 18 pounds. 
'It is better to be safe than sorry." 



A MORNING PRAYER. 

The day returns and brings us the petty round of ir- 
ritating concerns and duties. Help us to play the man, 
help us to perform them with laughter and kind faces; 
let cheerfulness abound with industry. Give us to go 
blithely on our business all this day, bring us to our rest- 
ing beds weary and content and undishonored ; and grant 
us in the end the gift of sleep. Amen, — Robert Louis 
Stevenson.

This division depends upon circumstances. If beef 
sells even, this table is as accurate as it can be made, but 
if there is a great demand for hinds, the price would be 
more. If the demand should be for the fronts, the hinds 
would be cheaper. These conditions cannot be con- 
trolled, but are simply caused by supply and demand.

NOTE — The greatest problem we have to solve is 
to establish a relative value between the hind and front 
quarters of beef, and this must be done, as the hind 
quarters are at all times worth more than the fronts. It 
is not necessary to sell beef that costs 5 cents according 
to the 5-cent table when you can sell it on the 6-cent 
table as well.

CUTTING MEATS. 

This is the most essential part of the meat business. 
Great care should be taken that the meat is cut smooth 
and not hacked or ragged. Do not trim it more than is 
absolutely necessary. Use the saw whenever you can in- 
stead of the cleaver. Cut the meats close and carefully. 
Make as few odds and ends as you possibly can. When 
cutting, try and cut as much to the best cuts as you can, 
as there are always plenty of cheap cuts. Be accurate and 
quick at figures, alvv^ays getting the money or charge the 
meat. When you want to cut 5 pounds, cut 5 pounds and 
not 10. This 3^ou must learn by experience. There is no 
rule to go by. Be tidy, courteous and clean. If there is 
something you have not got, try and sell something that 
is similar, as it may answer as well. Try and sell some- 
thing. 

.Moral — Customer. — Have you any toilet paper? 

Clerk. — No, we have fly paper and sand paper. 



CUTTING PRICES. 

This is the greatest folly the business men have to 
contend with. Just imagine yourself selling goods for 
less than they cost to spite your neighbor, losing money 
every day, hurting yourself perhaps more than the man 
you are aiming at, and the public reaping a harvest. 

Would it not be better for both to be on friendly 
terms, compromising the small differences, and live and 
let live. Remember that there are other markets and that 
the public love to drift from place to place, looking for 
bargains. If you have anything to give away, tell one 
person, he tells 20, the 20 200, and so on. The news of 
bargains travels very rapidly, and the money of a man 
who cuts prices evaporates.

CARE OF REFRIGERATOR. 

The most important part is to see to it that there is 
plenty of ice and that the doors are tight and not opened 
more nor longer than necessary. Do not lay the meat on 
the floor. Keep the floor clean. Scrub it out at least 
once a month. Go through the stock every day. Keep 
the pieces cleaned up, trimmed up and salted. Never put 
off until tomorrow what should be done today in your 
refrigerator, for tomorrow may be too late. Look care- 
fully at your brine. When it needs changing, change it 
m time. Allowing nothing to get sticky or stale. Never 
buy more stock than you really need, and one-half of the 
battle is fousfht. 



SELLING MEATS. 

Meats should be sold for what they are worth. 
Loins, ribs and legs are always worth all that you ask 
for them, as the demand will make them command a 
price. The stews, shanks, feet, kidneys, suet, etc., have 
always been and always will be cheap, and at times must 
be forced off, at some price, even if the price should be 
low. The most essential thing to do is to ask a price for 
the better cuts so that you can sacrifice the cheaper with- 
out losing money, and at the same time keeping your 
stock cleaned up, and run even. Should you ever at any 
time have more of the better cuts than your trade de- 
mands, you can at all times find a buyer.

trimmings from neck, and the chine-bones from the 
chops. After lambs get over i6c per pounds, you hardly 
ever get one to weight 40 pounds, but the price for the 
different cuts is the same per pound. It does not matter 
what the weight of the lamb is. There are simply more 
or less pounds of each kind of cuts, according to the 
weight of the lamb. Lambs at 18 cents per pound should 
be sold by the quarter as it is almost impossible to make 
money by cutting into chops, etc.

crease in value by the pound, the value of the skin in- 
creases, as they are dear in the spring when the fleece is 
long, and brings the highest price, often $2.00 or more 
per pelt.

FORTY YEARS AGO VS. TODAY. 

Forty years ago the killing of cattle vv^as largely done 
in the open felds, using a tripod with a windlass attached 
to hoist the beef. A limb of a tree, or a beam in a barn 
sometimes answered the purpose. An ax was used in- 
stead of a cleaver to split. Today we have modern 
slaughter-houses with every known convenience for the 
handling and killing of cattle. Hogs were also killed in 
the open; the kettle suspended on a pole. Later the 
kettles were bricked in ; wood and coal provided the heat. 
Now steam tanks are taking their place. 

Sheep were dressed principally for their pelt. Car- 
casses sold at from 25c to 50c each. Today the carcass 
IS the most valuable. 

Sausage meat was first chopped by hand ; then came 
the grinders with the vv^ooden box ; the rocker next, then 
the chopper, and last and best, the silent-cutter. 

The stuffer was made from wood, a rather crude 
concern; then came the wagner, which has been svip- 
planted by the steam stuffer. 

The counter tops were of plain wood, and after- 
wards oilcloth adorned the top. Marble has taken their 
place. The blocks were cut from a log; some even had 
the bark on. Later they were made with legs, and now 
and then a bench to cut meats on. The sectional blocks 
have taken the place of all. 

Refrigerators was unknown. The meats were 
dressed at night and cut up the following day. Then 
came the ice chest, the meat laying on the ice; then the 
ice box wet and damp, without circulation, and the boxes 
became somewhat dryer. Today we have the refrig- 
erator, cold and dry, but still using ice. The next will be 
brine or compressed air, to supplant the ice.

50 THE MODERN BUTCHER 

Tallow was rendered in the open, made into cakes, 
and mostly sold locally for the manufacture of soap and 
candles. 

In cutting meats, the quarters were laid on the block, 
a pm driven through into the block, when they com- 
menced cutting from all sides, always taking care to keep 
the bones covered with meat. Trimmings were un- 
known. Meats were always sold to roast or stew; oc- 
casionally some one would want meat to fry. Beefsteak 
was unknown. 

Killing of cattle locally was first supplanted by the 
refrigerator car, and later by the beef houses, which are 
in almost every city today. 

In days gone by it required a vast amount of capital 
to operate a meat market in order to buy stock, own and 
operate a slaughter house, and carry a few customers ; 
but today it requires just as much capital, and it is prin- 
cipally invested in book accounts. 

Where there was one meat market then, there are 
ten today — all striving to making a living in some way. 

And who is to blame? In years gone by, a young 
man would apprentice himself to work for not less than 
three years to learn the trade. He stepped on the lowest 
round of the ladder and worked his way to the top. To- 
day they stand on the middle round and a very few work 
up; the majority fail down. These are the butchers we 
have today. 

And this is just what makes unfair competition. For 
they do not know what or where they are at, but struggle 
and fight to the end. Then another takes his place, and 
dO on. When will it ever cease ? 

Moral — There is a fool born every minute.

These prices may vary a little from time to time, ac- 
cording to supply and demand. Any article that is in 
demand will always bring a better price than one that 
must be crowded off, as the sacrifice in price must make 
il sell. You will notice that as pork in the hog advances 
m price, the better cuts advance very rapidly, while the 
poorer cuts remain almost stationary. 

There is always more or less shrinkage in the Hog 
before it is cut ; and again after it is cut up into pieces, the 
amount of shrinkage is hard to determine. It will all 
depend on how long the pork lay around before cutting 
?>nd packing. There is also expense attached to the 
cutting and handling of the pork. This again all depends 
upon the facilities you have for handling, the wages you 
pay for labor, etc. 

The schedules are prepared to show what amount of 
ham, bacon, shoulder, back, head, feet, etc., can be cut 
out of pork, and the approximate value or cost of each 
article. If a hog weighs more than 150 pounds, the cuts 
will all weight more. If the hog weighs less, the cuts will 
weigh less.

Grass, swill, malt and still-fed hogs will render less 
lard than corn and pea-fed hogs, as the fat contains more 
water than dry-fed hogs. 

This table is for fat when it costs from 4c per pound

SALTING HIDES AND PELTS. 

Lay all skins with the hair sides down. Spread out. 
Throw on plenty of salt all over. If beef hides, turn in 
the head and bellies, making a square pile. Calf hides 
may be salted with beef hides. Pelts should be salted 
separate. If you have but one, rub salt on the flesh side, 
then hang up or throw over a beam to dry. If more than 
one, make a pile. Use plenty of salt and keep the pile 
moist as the hides will cure much better.

YANKEE PORK SAUSAGE. 

Since the pure food bill has gone into effect, make a 
little sausage and make it often, as the law prohibits the 
use of preservalines. 

Trim your meat fairly lean. Trim off all the stale 
meat. Chop moderately fine. Season with pepper, salt 
and a very little sage. Stuff or sell in bulk. 

Be sure and trim off all stale meat as it is far cheaper 
to throw away a pound of meat then to spoil the whole 
batch. 

Moral — Good meat makes good sausage. 

N. B. — If you are in a locality where they permit the 
use of preservaline, a little added will make your sausage 
stay fresh for 10 days. 

NOTE — Salt and season to taste; use as little water 
as possible ; charge more for your sausage and make them 
good. In warm weather use but a very little sage, as it 
will sour the sausage. Should you use a little beef, chop 
the beef first and very fine, then add the pork and chop 
again. A little ground mace or nutmeg may be added.

PICKLED SOUSE. 

Clean pig snoots, cut from bone, and salt light in 
brine for a few days. Cook slow. Cut up in strips ; stuff 
into beef bungs ; season with salt, pepper, a pinch of 
marjoram, a small quantity of mustard seed, whole ; add a 
little vinegar to pickle. Press and weight. Leave for 
12 hours. This make a fine luncheon. 



HEAD CHEESE. 

Clean the heads thoroughly. Cut out eyes and ears. 
Salt for a few days in brine ; add a little salt petre, as this 
hardens the meat and gives it a good color ; then wash 
out and cook slow for 4 or 5 hours. Cut into strips and 
stuff into beef bungs. Season with pepper and mar- 
joram. Put back into kettle so as to shrink the caseing, 
then put into cold water for 10 minutes, after which press 
between boards. Weight heavy. Leave stand 12 hours. 

LIVER SAUSAGE. 

Prepare heads as for head cheese. Cook very tender. 
Grind the meat fine. Cook about 10 pounds of liver to 
100 pounds of meat. Grind or chop fine. Season with 
salt to taste, 10 oz. pepper, 6 onions, 2 oz. whole mustard 
seed, a small pinch of marjoram, a little ground cloves. 
Stuff in round beef casing. Put in kettle to scald the 
casing. Cool in water for 15 minutes. Hang up and dry. 
Keep in a cool dry place. 

PRESSED CORNED BEEF. 

Take plate and flank beef; make a brine of salt 
strong enough to float an egg. To 15 gallons brine add 
2 oz. salt peter. Salt the meat 10 to 14 days, then boil 
slow 5 or 6 hours. Bone and stuff in cotton sacks ; then 
press between boards. Weight down ; let it stand for 
12 hours, then clean off the fat from sacks. This makes 
delicious lunch meat; besides it works up your surplus 
stews.

THE PROPRIETOR. 

Business, is it is termed, means the buying and sell- 
ing of goods. In order to be successful, you must charge 
enough more to cover the first cost of goods and all the 
expense of selling — your salary, your rent, whether you 
own the building or not, and interest on your money in- 
vested. If you own the building and can rent it for $25.00 
a month, it is worth that to you. If you could work for 
someone else and command $15.00 a week, you should be 
worth that to yourself. These items should be charged 
up against your business. Your business is as legitimate 
as any, and your gross profits should be based on a per- 
centage large enough to cover all the above items; con- 
sequently we have m.ade all calculations on a basis of 20 
per cent above original cost. This is intended as a safe- 
guard against losing money when the market is up. 

Anyone can sell meat when it is cheap.

TIPS FOR THE PROPRIETOR. 

"Goods bought right are half sold." 

"If we please you, tell others ; if we don't, tell us." — 
Your motto, 

"The quality of your goods, your prices and the way 
you treat people will advertise your business. 

"A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden 
full of weeds." 

Be careful when you wait on children, as you must 
judge for them. 

Never sell spoiled meat knowingly. 

Try and send meat that will please and not displease. 

If you don't want any trade, lock up. 

Allow no accounts to run beyond your means to 
carry them. 

Never borrow money to carry accounts. 

A bird in the hand is worth three in the bush. 

Money saved is money earned. 

Never buy what you don't want. 

The time to sell is when you have a buyer. 

When you have a man in your employe who is shift- 
less, careless, and spends his money in a foolish way, he 
IS shiftless every way, and hardly ever satisfied, because 
he never sees anything from his labor ; but on the other 
hand, if he is of a saving disposition for himself he will 
be for you. They are the ones to encourage and keep in 
your employ. 

Advance them and pay them all you can afford. 

Always have a regular time to open and also to close. 
0\\ liolidays have a half day for yourself, and never open 
on Sundays. You will live just as long, and if you can- 
not make money in six days, you will never make it in 
seven. 

Six days thou shalt labor and on the seventh thou 

shalt rest. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 



It is not the dollar that you make that makes one 
rich ; it is the dollar that you save. . . 

Do your customers who go away on their summer 
vacation (who owe you) ever stop to think or ask you if 
you need any money to do business with while they are 
gone? 

Do not tell everybody of your troubles. Keep them 
to yourself. 

If you lose money, look for it where you lost it. 

If you make a little money, save at least a part of it, 
as s'^ime day it may be of some use to you. 

Your business is as legitimate as any other business 
and you should base your percentage of profits high 
enough to cover all expenses and leave you a margin of 
clear profit. 

A man may look dear to you at $15.00 a week but he 
may be cheaper than a $10.00 man. 

Remember that paper costs money. 

Keep plenty of ice. It is cheaper than meat. 

Don't try to spoil 100 pounds of sausage trying to 
save a pound of spoiled meat. 

Never trim your meat any more than is absolutely 
necessary, as it all costs you money. 

The trimmings may be your only profits. 

Horses cost money. Look after them. If your 
wagon needs a bolt or two, put them in. A stitch in time 
saves nine. 

A little paint makes a vast difference in your market. 

Keep the market supplied with brooms, brushes, 
soap and water. They will bring you trade. 

If you expect to buy, you must sell. If you sell 
nothing, you buy nothing. 

Have a man's friendship if you don't have his trade.

A FEW TIPS ON THE QUIET. 

Take care of the pennies, and the dollars will take 
care of themselves. 

Take care of your health, as health is wealth. 

Take care of your business, for no one else will. 

Buy as cheap as you can and sell for a fair profit. 

Keep your accounts collected, for short accounts 
make long friends. 

Do not hesitate to refuse credit if the persons are un- 
wortliy. 

Limit all your customers according to their standing. 

V\''hen you say "Yes," mean "Yes." 

When you say "No," mean "No." 

Never watch and wait for a friend who has a note to 
indorse. 

Always charge enough for your meats to cover the 
first costs and the expense of selling added. 



BUSINESS. 

Never hire a man who will lie, steal, smoke cigar- 
ettes, or get drunk. 

Never allow your men to run you or your business. 

Never give them too much freedom with your 
money. 

Never allow them to abuse your horse or any 
animals. 

Never place too much confidence in your customers. 

Never indorse a note for a friend. 

Never carry much money about you. 

Never hide it in the stove. Put it in a bank. Never 
throw away receipts. 

Never forget to lock your door. 

Remember, you are not in business for your health. 

Politics and business don't mix any better than oil 
and water. 

To be a business man is one thing. 

To be a politician is another.

BLOOD POISON. 

This is caused by a scratch, and coming in contact 
with putrid meat, green, slippery, slimy or verdigris from 
brass on the saws or scales. 

Symptoms — The sore turns purple, red, itches, be- 
comes inflamed, and if not cared for in time, may pro- 
duce death. 

Poultice with linseed meal, slippery elm, and a few 
drops of carbolic acid, as hot as you can stand it. Keep 
putting on new ones for hours, which will draw it to a 
head. Lance, and let the matter out. Poultice again 
until the inflammation has disappeared. 

If there is danger of it spreading, take Iodine and 
paint a circle above it, as it will not pass this. To heal 
the wound, take yi pound pure lard, Y^ oz. lodysyl, 3 
tablespoons of arnica; apply night and morning. In 
severe cases call in the doctor. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 83 



CARE OF HORSES. 

A horse ; a kingdom for a horse. 

Keep the barn clean and dry. See that the horses 
teeth are in good shape so that they can properly grind 
their food. This is half the battle, and will protect 
against colic or indigestion. 

Feed regularly; water often (but not when warm). 

You can feed too much oats as well as too little. If 
your horse is poor, feed a small quantity of linseed meal 
or raw linseed oil in oats night and morning. Never feed 
wilted grass to a horse. Shoe as often as required. Don't 
wait for the shoes to fall off. In summer pack the front 
feet with whiterock clay or linseed meal twice a week. 
If the hoof becomes hard, use the following on outside: 

Equal parts of turpentine, pine tar, neatsfoot oil, and 
Tanners oil. For scratches, use lard, sulphur, carbolic 
acid, and calomel. For foot-rot or thrush, clean out the 
frog and dust in powdered calomel. For sores and galls, 
one pound lard vaseline, pine tar, equal parts ; melt to- 
gether ; add tablespoon carbolic acid, arnica, calomel ; 
wash the sore with castile soap and keep it clean. 

In case of colic and no veterinary near, boil what 
spices you have on hand, such as pepper, ginger, cloves, 
salt soda ; when cool, put in a bottle and force down 
throat. That will relieve until you can get a veterinary. 
For urine, give teaspoon salt peter in oats or sweet spirits 
of Nitre. For worms, 2 to 4 oz. turpentine ; repeat after 
three days ; in one pint raw linseed oil. For sprains, use 
turpentine, vinegar, amonia and white of eggs, equal 
parts ; shake well. This will not blister. A good brush- 
ing with a stiff brush will add to the appearance of the 
horse. 



84 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



TO FEED SHEEP. 

Sheep should have moderately warm quarters, dry- 
under foot and overhead ; plenty of water and salt. The 
forage should consist of alfalfa, clover, cornstalks, bean 
or pea straw. Grain should be oats, cracked corn, peas or 
beans. Start to feed grain slowly gradually increasing 
the amount. Timothy hay, oats or wheat straw have little 
value, but turnips sugar beets, rutabaggas and mengels 
are very valuable in feeding sheep. 



TO FATTEN CHICKENS AND TURKEYS. 

Chickens and Turkeys should be kept on a ground 
floor. Cover floor with sawdust, coal or wood ashes and 
a little slack lime. Keep as clean as possible. White- 
wash roosts and walls ; clean out the droppings often, as 
they contain a vast amount of amonia which is very in- 
jurious. Give plenty of water; provide a box for grit of 
some kind ; oyster-shells, gravel, broken pottery, etc. 
Don't neglect this, as they must have them. Provide a 
dust-bath, consisting of slack lime and wood ashes. 
Feed in troughs, wheat, rye, buckwheat, ground bone ; 
in day time ; in the evening, whole corn. 



LAYING HENS. 

Feed as above, but if you boil the morning feed and 
add a little red pepper and once in a while scalded bran, 
it will make your hens lay. 



BUYING STOCKERS OR FEEDING CATTLE. 

Start right by buying good, bright, thrifty cittle, well 
bred, with two good ends. Avoid Jerseys and Hol- 
steins. If you want cattle of 800 pounds each, buy them. 
If you want heavier cattle buy them ; but do not mix, for 
light and heavy will not feed alike. Buy dehorned cattle, 
as they are much easier to keep and care for, and are not 
so unruly. Always buy cattle in good flesh, as they are 
in condition to stand the grain. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 85 



COW LOSING HER CUD. 

Take one pound of fat salt pork, cut in long strips 
and force down throat. This will give almost immediate 
relief. 

TO FATTEN HOGS. 

Boil your feed, such as beets, potatoes, pumpkins, 
etc. It will go further and produce more pork than if 
fed raw. Feed ear corn. Keep the pens clean and dry. 
Give plenty to drink, and a little charcoal once a week, as 
this prevents sour stomach or indigestion. 



SMALL PIGS. 

Should have all their feed boiled. 

CARS OF BROOD SOWS. 

Never give brood sows much dry grain. Their feed 
should be of a sloppy nature. Provide with a good large 
nest. If the nest is small, she will be apt to kill her 
young. Should she eat her pigs, give her a piece of fat 
pork ; it will satisfy her appetite. In winter, pen her up 
in a warm place and watch her for a few days. When the 
pigs are born, see to it that they are nursed properly. Use 
chaff or short straw for bedding. 

HOW TO STUFF SAUSAGE. 

Bologna should be stuffed tight as it prevents 
shrinking. 

Frankforts moderately tight so as to allow for the 
twisting'. 

Pork sausage moderate to allow for the tying. 

Liver sausage slack to allow for expansion of the 
liver and contraction of the caseing. 

Head cheese tight in order for the me-^.t to congeal 
and stick together. 

Blood sausage slack so as to allow for expansion of 
the blood and contraction of the caseing. 

Pressed corned beef should be stuffed as tight as 
can be done as the meat must adhere together and be- 
come solid.

TO FEED CATTLE IN OPEN LOT. 

Build a shed by setting posts into the ground 7 feet 
high. Side up with any kind of lumber or poles. Place 
poles over the top of the posts and build the straw-stack 
over the top of the shed, leaving a large opening for a 
door. Keep the shed well bedded. Build a feed rack in 
the lot 3 feet high, 4 feet wide, and as long as is needed. 
Feed the corn stalks and all, and as much as the cattle 
will clean up. Water twice a day. The water should be 
luke warm in winter, as cattle will thrive better than on 
ice cold water. Heat the water by placing a tank heater 
in the tank. Build a cover over the tank and make a lid 
cut of one-half the cover. 

Ten hogs will feed with each 25 head of cattle. 

Salt the cattle once a week. 

TO FEED CATTLE. 

Start to grain cattle while on the grass. Increase the 
amount of grain gradually. Give all the water they will 
drink at least twice a day. Salt once or twice a week. 
When the grass is gone, give them all the hay, corn, fod- 
der or ensilage that they will clean up. Keep the barn 
dry and warm. The water should be luke warm ; this 
can be done by placing a heater in the tank. You will 
fmd this will aid greatly in the feeding of cattle : One 
pint linseed meal should also be given at least once a 
day; roots will answer the same purpose. 

DEHORNING CALVES. 

This should be done when the button starts. Damp- 
en around the horn ; take a caustic pencil and pass around 
the roots of the horn. In a short time the button will 
drop off. Be careful that you do not burn your fingers 
with the pencil. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 87 



REFRIGERATOR. 

Should be built with double floors, walls and glass, 
not less than seven feet high inside, to allow a person to 
stand upright with a hog or quarter of beef, etc. Build 
racks on the two sides and rear end, a display rack at the 
front windows. Have the lower part of the refrigerator 
extend out into the market, making a convenient place 
for the keeping of salt pork and corned beef barrels, also 
a slide upon which to lay pieces. Have it so arranged in 
the rear where the ice is put in that it may be put m as 
rapidly as possible and as large pieces as can be handled, 
for the more you break the ice up, the sooner it will melt. 

The ice door should fit very tight, and not be opened 
except to put in ice. Accommodating anyone with a 
piece of ice means a loss of ice and money to you, and is 
considered to be a bad practice. 

BRINE FOR BEEF. 

Do not make as strong as for Hams. Make from salt 
and water ; i ounce of salt peter to lo gallons brine, so 
that when an tgg is placed in it, it will just come to the 
surface. Skim off the foam, as this is caused by the lime 
in the salt, 

TO CORN BEEF. 

Take the beef while fresh. Do not wait until it is 
SDoikd, as it is too late then to corn it. Cut into suitable 
pieces, trim off the ragged ends and drop into the brine 

loose. 

SMOKE HOUSE. 

A smoke-house should be built of brick, not less 
than 12 feet high. The ventilation should be at the top 
under the eaves. About six feet from the ground have 
dropping doors; below these you smoke your sausage; 
above these the meats. When hanging up the meats 
stand on one door ; pass the meat up through the other. 
There will be room enough above for three rows of meat. 
A vent hole may be cut in the bottom of the door. 

NOTE— Summer sausage, head-cheese, or pork sau- 
sage should be smoked above with cool smoke as for 
hams. 

SOUR BRINE. 

When brine begins to turn yellow, throw it away, as 
it is getting sour and will spoil your meat. Salt is by far 
cheaper than meat. 



88 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



SLAUGHTER-HOUSE. 

A slaughter-house should be built at least two feet 
above the ground, should be double-boarded and papered 
between to make it warm enough so that the beef does 
not freeze in winter. There should be plenty of windows 
with screen wire on the outside so as to keep out the 
flies in summer. The floor should pitch to one side or 
to the center oi the building into a trough, which should 
pitch slightly in order that the water, etc., may be easily 
swept out. The floor should be strong, and covered 
with matched lumber as tight as it can be laid in order 
to prevent the blood and water dripping through, as this 
usually causes the stench around the house. The hog- 
lot should be no less than ten feet from the building. A 
trough leading from the building to the hog-lot. The 
beams should be high enough to permit the killing of any 
animal, also strong enough. The windlass should be 
placed in the corner out of the way. The floor ring 
should be near the cattle-pen and in line with the wind- 
lass. The scalding kettle for hogs should be oblong, 
bricked in, commencing from the ground, leaving the 
fire-place below the floor. This will leave your scraping 
table so that the men can stand on the floor to work. 
The killing pen for hogs should be the height of the 
kettle. An incline chute should be built from the hog-lot 
to the killing pen. One side of the building should have 
a rack the entire length to hang small stuff on. Be cer- 
tain that you have plenty of water. Whitewash as often 
as required. Tallow should never be rendered in a 
slaughter-house. Build a small shed alongside. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 89 



KILLING OF CATTLE. 

Cattle should never be killed when they are warm or 
on a full stomach. Let the head lie lower than the body 
so as to allow them to bleed properly. When sticking, 
merely sever the main artery. Do not stick clear through 
and cause the blood to gather inside and clot. Work as 
rapidly as possible. When your beef is sided, open it up 
and raise ; remove the entrails at once ; wipe the hind 
legs ; saw down the tail and rump ; split through the loins 
with a cleaver ; hoist up and split neck through to floor ; 
pump out the shoulders ; trim off the blood from inside 
of neck, stroke down the veins in the kidneys ; then wipe 
with a clean cloth rung out of water. Never throw 
water on beef. In wiping the back, wipe up and not 
down. 

NOTE — Always wash off and hang up the liver, 
heart and tonsfue. 



KILLING HOGS. 

Do not kill when warm or on full feed. Be sure they 
bleed properly. Take pains and not shoulder-stick. 
Throw a little slack lime or wood ashes in the water, as 
this will soften the water so that the hair comes off 
easier. 

Take your time in scalding. Do not get your water 
too hot. Try the ears and feet. If they go, the rest will 
come. Always scrape head, feet and tail first. Shave 
the hog on the bench ; cut out gamble cords ; hang up ; 
throw cold water on outside ; scrape down with a knife 
or scraper ; open from top to breast-bone ; remove en- 
trails ; split open breast ; remove liver and lights ; dash 
a little water in neck ; take a damp cloth and wipe inside. 
Use no water inside the hog. Never kill or stick a hog 
until you are ready to scald. Remove entrails as quick as 
possible. 

NOTE — Hang up the pluck. 



90 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



KILLING SHEEP. 

Do not kill when warm. Cut their throat and break 
neck by pushing the head backwards. Skin out front 
legs ; pull back the skin from breast ; skin out hind legs ; 
unjoint the feet and separate the cords in rear of legs; 
tie legs together with a heavy twine; hang up in the 
open so that you can work all around ; open skin on belly ; 
skin back the flanks with knife, then push off the pelt 
with your fist to the back on both sides. Loosen the pelt 
on the hind legs and pull down (do not tear) ; cut around 
the rectum; pull it out; cut off tail; then drop your pelt; 
come in front ; skin down each side of neck ; pull the skin 
down from the back of neck; unjoint front feet. Wipe 
with a damp cloth. Use no water. Open up ; remove 
bladder, entrails, etc. Wipe out with damp cloth. 



KILLING OF LAMBS. 

Do as with sheep, and when you come to take out 
entrails, first remove the call or net from pouch; keep 
it clean ; lay it on the flesh side of pelt ; cover it up to 
keep it soft and warm ; wipe out the lamb ; put in your 
back sets, then take your call with the thin end up and 
stretch it across the hind legs, letting it hang down to 
the breast-bone; fasten on the outside of hind legs with 
a skewer and on each side on the ends of the back sets. 
Also strike the call between the hind legs with a knife 
to separate it ; wrap around hind legs ; cut a small slit in 
the call where the bladder is, so that the air may circu- 
late between the hind legs ; also over the kidneys ; pull 
the kidneys through and let them hang. Lambs should 
be left hanging until cool, never load warm lambs. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 91 



KILLING CALVES. 

Do not kill when warm. Strike on the head with 
hammer. Cut the throat from ear to ear; take out the 
head ; unjoint hind legs ; stick a hole in the gamble-joint 
for the gamble ; hang up ; remove intestines ; split open 
the breast ; remove the liver, heart, etc. ; take out hind 
legs and front legs ; wipe out. Use no water. Hang up 
the pluck and head. 



KILLING CHICKENS. 

Cut the head off or cut throat. Stick a hole through 
neck back of the head and sever artery, or cut across the 
roof of mouth. To do this you must hang up by the legs. 
Do not get the water too hot. Put in a small piece of 
soap, as this will soften the water. Pick the feathers off 
(do not rub). Dip in hot water, then into cold water, 
as this will plump them up. Draw and hang up by legs 
until cool before packing. Never pack when warm. 

KILLING TURKEYS. 

Shrink well, then dress the same as chickens. Take 
pains not to tear the skin. 

KILLING DUCKS AND GEESE. 

Always pick the breasts dry, as the water will not 
penetrate. Scald, then wrap in a piece of wet burlap. 
Let them lay and steam for ten minutes or more. This 
will shrink the quill and allow the feathers to come out 
easy. Never pack in a box or barrel while warm.

REiSTDERING LARD. 

Cut up your fat in small pieces. Cut off all tainted 
parts. Should the kettle be rusty or black, put in a little 
water and soap. Take a piece of sand-stone and scour 
until it is bright. Put in about one pint of water, then 
put in your lard. Use a slow fire for the first 15 minutes. 
Increase until nearly done. Then slow down. When 
the scrap is dark yellow, take out the lard. Do not wait 
until the scrap is brown. Have the lard press and cooler 
clean. Tie a piece of cotton over the top of the cooler, 
through which strain the lard. Remove the cloth and 
allow the lard to settle and cool before putting into pack- 
ages. Should the fat be a trifle sour, slice some potatoes 
or apples and drop in the lard while it is cooking. This 
will sweeten it. If you are clean and careful, you cannot 
help but make good lard. 

RENDERING TALLOW. 

Render the same as lard. Render often. Never 
leave slaughter-house fat lay on the floor, but hang up 
all you can ; the rest lay on a rack in order that it may dry 
out, as it will render much quicker. The foam on tallow 
or lard is caused by the water in the fat. 

RENDERING GREASE. 

Grease skimmings from cooking can be worked up 
into your tallow if taken fresh, but should you have an 
accumulation, put into the kettle, pour in two pails of 
water, let it come to a boil, then skim off the grease. 
Empty the kettle ; put in the grease again and boil until 
it stops steaming. Put into your tank to cool. 

TO SMOKE BOLOGNA. 

Let the bologna dry off a little before putting in the 
smoke-house. Start your fire and let the smoke-house 
get hot before putting in the sausage. The sausage is 
simply dried by heat and not smoke. Use dry, clean 
hardwood, split fine, so as to make a brisk fire. Have 
your water ready to boil. When the bologna floats and 
the skin is firm, the bologna is cooked. 

Frankforts are smoked the same as bologna. Hang 
them far enough apart to allow the heat to pass between 
them. Let the sausage cool off before tieing into 
bunches.

MORE TRUTH THAN POETRY. 

Waste not, want not, is a maxim I would teach. 
Let your watch be dispatch and practice what you preach. 
Never let your chances like sunbeams pass you by. 
For you'll never miss the water 'til the well runs dry. 

TO TRIM HAMS. 

Saw off the foot above the gamble-joint. Saw off 
the ham from the loin. Do not chop. Have a long, sharp 
knife. Cut off the surplus fat from face of ham. Cut 
round on corners on the large ends of ham; cut well 
under. Hold your knife straight up and down. 

TO TRIM BACON. 

Cut flank off square. Should the belly be flabby and 
ragged, trim off surplus fat. 

TO TRIM SHOULDERS. 

Saw off foot above knee. Cut out the spare rib, then 
cut off the top end square. Cut the neck off almost to 
the shoulder-joint, leaving the joint covered. Level up 
the face. 

BUYING LIVE CATTLE. 

The best and safest way to buy is by weight,^ theri 
you get what you pay for. To determine the quality of 
the cattle is to find out their condition. Cattle that are 
fat have a thick flank, a large cod ; the root of the tail is 
thick ; the rump is well covered ; the brisket hangs down 
and is full ; the throat is thick, and the back is broad and 
full; the sides are straight; the abdomen or belly is 
drawn up. An experienced buyer never puts his hand 
on cattle; he judges them with the eye. To buy by the 
dollar means years of experience. There is no rule gov- 
erning this. It is simply good judgment. There are men 
in the business who can lay a bunch of ten to twenty 
cattle within one hundred pounds of their weight.

TO KEEP LARD. 

Lard should be kept in a cool place during summer. 
If exposed to the heat, it will become rancid. Never use 
salt in lard. Use clean tight packages. 



TO CLEAN BARRELS. 

When pork or beef barrels get slimy, use hot water 
and soap. Scrub inside and outside, and stand in the 
open air (to air out). Avoid salting and packing meats 
in a sour barrel. 

SAGE. 

BuJ the whole leaf, as it is much stronger, and also 
purer than the powdered or ground. 



GARLIC. 

Keep in glass fruit jars sealed up; if not, it will 
evaporate. 

BOILING HAMS. 

In boiling hams have water warm before placing in 
the hams, then run the temperature up to 200 deg. F., 
after which allow temperature to drop slowly to 160. 

The hams should remain in the water about 4 to 6 
hours, after which place them in cold water for 15 min- 
utes — then place in cool room to drain or in water. Let 
them lay in the water they are boiled in over night. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 95 



BLOOD SAUSAGE. 

Use 60 pounds fresh cheek, 20 pounds pig skins, 20 
pounds fresh strained hog blood. The pork should be 
boiled and chopped fine, then mix with the blood. Sea- 
son with I ounce ground white pepper, 4 ounces cloves, 
5 ounces allspice and >4 ounce marjoram. Fill loosely 
into beef middles then scald i hour in water below the 
boiling point, prick occasionally with thin wire, on being 
pressed if no blood is observed the sausage is done. To 
smoke dry for 24 hours, then place in cold smoke. 



HEAD CHEESE. 

To 12 salted pig heads use 10 pounds beef cheek 
meat, hearts or neck trimmings, in fact any meats that 
cannot be v/orked up to advantage in other sausage. 
When cooked cut or chop into dice or narrow strips 
adding a few pig tongues cooked and cut up into strips 
or left whole. For 100 pounds stock season with 6^2 
ounces ground white pepper, yi ounce ground nutmeg, 2 
ounces allspice, i ounce ground celery seed. 



POLISH SAUSAGE. 

Take 50 pounds beef trimmings and 25 pounds pork 
trimmings preserved with yi pound salt petre for 5 
days and 25 fresh pork trimmings from pig heads or 
butts. Chop to about half pea size, adding while chop- 
ping 35 pounds water, 6 ounces ground white pepper and 
6 pieces garlic rubbed up with salt. Fill into hog casings, 
form into double links 8 to 10 inches long and smoke over 
hot fire from 2 to 2^ hours. 



96 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. 

Use two-thirds beef, preserved with salt petre 
and one-third fresh beef; chop to about bean size; 
then add 8 pounds of fat pork to every 100 pounds of 
beef; chop all together to the required fineness. While 
chopping add from time to time 20 to 30 pounds of 
water to each 100 pounds of meat, season with 10 
ounces black pepper, 5 ounces ground cloves and 2 
ounces Coriander seed, and let it stand in a cool room 
over night before stuffing. Stuff tight into beef rounds 
or middles; smoke lightly about 40 mJnutes or until 
the casings are shrunk, cook in hot water until the 
sausage floats then drop them into cold water for a 
few minutes, after which hang up. By following in- 
structions the bologna will retain its moisture and give 
satisfaction. 



PORK SAUSAGE. 

Take lOO pounds moderately lean fresh pork trim- 
mings and i6 ounces salt. While chopping season with 
6^ ounces ground white pepper, ^ ounce ground nut- 
meg, 2 ounces allspice, i ounce ground celery seed, 2 
ounces ground mace, a small quantity of finely powdered 
sage ; adding from time to time after the meat is partly 
chopped lo to 15 pounds of water. 

Pork sausage made as above directed will keep fresh 
for several days. 

Stuff the mass into hog casings making small links 
or in sheep casings if for fancy trade. The above can 
be sold under various fancy names. 



PORK SAUSAGE No. 1. 

Use 50 pounds of nice lean pork trimmings ; and 8 
ounces salt ; season with 4 ounces ground white pepper, 
I ounce allspice and a small quantity sage ; adding from 
time to time, while chopping, 5 to 8 pounds of water. 
Use no water in summer. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 97 



SMOKED PORK SAUSAGE. 

Take 50 pounds of beef preserved with salt peter ; 25 
pounds of pork with salt peter and 25 pounds of fresh 
pork trimmings. First chop the beef, then add the pork, 
add a little water while chopping. Mix well and season 
with 6 ounces of mace, 2 ounces Cayenne pepper and 4 
ounces of ground white pepper; stuff into pork casings, 
forming the usual links and after drying a short time 
smoke over a cool fire from 2^ to 4 hours. 



WIENERWURST. 

Take 10 pounds of veal; 50 pounds of lean pork; 
30 pounds beef that has been preserved with salt peter 
and 10 pounds of fat pork. Chop the whole fine; add 
while chopping 20 to 30 pounds of water, season with 
10 ounces black pepper, a little garlic to flavor, if so 
desired, 4 ounces ground corriander, 2 ounces ground

preserved with salt and salt peter and 20 pounds fat 
pork ; cut up into small pieces. First chop the beef fine, 
then add the lean pork, chop again, then add the fat pork 
that has previously been cut up into small pieces. Use 
no water. Salt and pepper to suit, adding about 2 ounces 
whole mustard seed, a little cardamon seed. A rocker is 
best as the meat is not so apt to become overheated, al- 
low to remain in a cool room for one or two days, turning 
the chopped mass to allow it to become thoroughly cool. 
Then knead well and stuff into beef middles or hog 
bungs very tightly, hang in the air to dry several days, 
after which smoke for 3 to 5 days in a cool smoke. The 
casings should be soaked well over night previous to 
being used to remove the salt and make them soft. 



98 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



TO CLEAN TRIPE. 

Use hot water about the same temperature as for 
scalding hogs. Throw in slack lime enough to make the 
water milk-white ; throw in the pouch and stir well. Try- 
it often ; when scalded, lay it on a board and scrape with 
a hog-scraper until clean. Trim the edges off and wash 
out in fresh water to remove the lime, then cook slow for 
five hours. When done, drop into cold water to make 
them white. 

PIGS FOR ROASTING. 

Pigs to roast should be small, from eight to fifteen 
pounds when dressed. 

To dress — bleed the pig carefully. Do not have the 
water too hot when scalding. Scald slowly. Shave the 
pig well. Wash off in clean water and scrape well. Re- 
move the eyes and toes; open from the hams to the 
breast-bone ; remove the intestines, liver, etc. ; remove 
the rectum from behind; open the throat and remove 
wind-pipe ; wipe out with damp cloth. 



TO CURE DRIED BEEF. 

Take the beef from the rounds. Separate the pieces 
in the seams ; rub with salt-peter, sugar or syrup and 
salt in rotation. Pack into crock or barrel tight as you 
can, then weigh down, as the beef should make its own 
brine; if not, make some sweet brine, enough to 
cover the meat. If the pieces are not too large, they will 
cure in 20 days. Soak over night and wash off. String 
and hang up to drain, after which smoke with a slow fire 
for 48 hours. 

TO CORN BEEF. 

Cut the beef into suitable pieces. Trim off all the 
ragged ends and any dry or putrid parts. Drop into 
brine ; use no salt, as it will make the beef black and hard. 
Use brine as per formula. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 99 



TO CLEAN PIGS FEET. 

Soak in warm water until they are soft ; dip the toes 
into boiling water, then take a hook and pull off the toes ; 
shave with a small, sharp knife. 

TO CLEAN BUNGS, MIDDLES AND ROUNDS. 

Remove the fat from outside ; then empty them out ; 
turn inside out. Use hot water to scald. Scrape with a 
dull knife to remove the slime. Wash out in fresh water ; 
then salt them in dry salt, packing them down solid, after 
which make a very strong brine and pour into the pack- 
age until the brine is even with the salt. 

NOTE — Care should be taken not to get the water 
too hot, or you will shrink the guts. 



PEPPER. 

Always buy whole pepper whether black or white. 
Get the best grade of sifted pepper then you will be cer- 
tain that there are no adulterations. 



PAPER. 

Buy 50 pound fiber in rolls as this is the proper 
weight and made expressly for butchers and is the most 
economic paper to use. Dispense with the old straw and 
also square paper. 

TWINE. 

To tie parcels and roasts use clean white twine. 
Never buy the cheap gray. For hams and bacon use 
heavy wool twine. 

SKEWERS. 

Buy hickory in preference to beach or maple. 



DISHES. 

Always buy maple, as they are better than paper. 



100 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



LINIMENT FOR SPRAINS. 

1 oz. Camphor. 

2 ozs. Arnica. 

yi oz. Chloroform. 

I oz. Amonia. 

Shake well before using. 



TO CURE A FELON. 

Felons usually come at the root of the finger nail, 
generally caused by a bruise. 

Symptoms — Great pain, and swelling; the skin over 
the felon red. 

To cure — Dip in boiling water several times in suc- 
cesson. The following day a white spot will appear, 
when open apply salve to draw out the puss and heal. 



TO CURE BOILS. 

Apply hot poultice. When the head becomes white, 
lance and apply salve to draw and heal. Never apply 
tupentine to a boil as it drives it away and into your sys- 
tem. 



TO MAKE NEAT FOOT OIL. 

Take the marrow from the shin bones of cattle. 
Melt and strain ; then add lampblack to blacken. Bes1» 
oil you can get for harness or any kind of leather or to 
apply on horses hoofs. 



POULTICE. 

Bread and milk, apply hot. 

Mullen leaves cooked in milk, apply hot. 

Flaxseed and slippery elm, apply hot. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 101 



IMPORTANT. 

The most important feature of the meat business i$ 
to keep the pieces cleaned up ; allow no odds and ends to 
accumulate. When you see that you are getting a sur- 
plus on hand, salt them in time. Do not wait until it is 
too late, for after meat is spoiled, neither salt nor salt- 
peter will save it. Remember that you pay for it all, and 
that you must get all you can out of it. 

This is where a great part of the losses occur. It 
amounts to a great many dollars during a year. 

Throw away nothing. Utilize it all. This is what 
counts. 



LIGHT. 

Keep your market well lighted. Nothing adds more 
to the appearance of a market. Gas or electric lights are 
the best, as there is no offensive odor from either. Oil 
and gasoline both have their faults. Keep a night light 
burning so that strangers can see that there are meat 
markets. There is nothing so dismal as a dark store at 
night. 



HEAT. 

A market should be heated a little in winter, just 
enough to keep the meats from freezing, and make it 
comfortable for the customers and employes. 



PENCILS. 

Pencils to be used on books should be hard, and for 
marking parcels soft. 



102 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



PARCELS. 

Parcels should be marked plainly with name and 
street number to avoid mistakes. 



TO SELL BEEF TONGUES. 

Fresh sell from loc per lb. to 15c. This all depends 
en the price of beef. 

To salt — Make brine as for corned beef. 

To smoke — After being in brine for 15 days, soak 
over night, hang up by small end and smoke with a slow 
fire for 24 hours, then hang up in a cool place. Always 
hang up by small end. 



INVOICES. 

Always check them up on receipt of the goods. 
Should there be any mistakes, this is the proper time to 
complain. Do not wait until the goods are sold to make 
a complaint. 

LARD PAILS. 

In buying lard pails, have your name and business 
address on them. This will advertise your business, as 
they are in evidence everywhere. 



SALT. 

For sausage, use clean fine salt. For packing and 
brine, use coarse rock salt. It is the best and purest for 
all kinds of pork and beef. 



SALT PETER. 

The proper kind to buy and the cheapest is crystal, 
as it protects you against adulteration. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 103 



TO GRIND KNIVES. 

Never grind a knife on a dry emery wheel, for if 
you do, you are taking great chances on burning it and 
drawing out the temper. Use water, or even better, the 
old-style water stone. 

SAFE. 

Protect yourself by having a safe, not for your money 
alone, but for your books and papers, which also repre- 
sents money. 

HOOKS. 

Hooks should be galvanized and kept clean. 
To clean, soak in hot soap water; scrub with a 
brush, and wipe dry. 



TOOLS. 

A market should be well supplied with small and 
large knives, cleavers, saws, steels, etc., and should be 
kept clean. 

TOWELS. 

Provide the market with towels, and teach the men 
to use them in preference to their aprons. 



BLOCK BROOM. 

Have a special broom for this purpose in a conveni- 
ent place, as it will answer the purpose better than the 
one you use to sweep the floor. 



SCREENS. 

Have screens on all doors and windows ; endeavor to 
keep out all the flies you possibly can, and make your 
market inviting. 



104 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



SCALES. 

Keep your scales accurate and clean, as the custom- 
ers always look at a scale. 

AMONIA IN BARN. 

To destroy amonia in a barn or hen-house, sprinkle 
the floor with air slacked lime. 

FOR DISENFECTING SEWERS. 

Use amonia, chlorate of lime, copperas or con- 
centrated lye. • Either will answer the purpose. 

TO WASH CANVASS. 

Canvass or beef cloths should be soaked in cold soft 
water. Make a strong soapsuds, to which add con- 
centrated lye or potash. Soak for 12 hours, after which 
wash in hot water or lay on the floor and scrub with a 
broom. 

TO WASH APRONS. 

Never put blood-stained aprons into hot water, as 
this causes spots wherever blood is. Soak over night in 
soapsuds, rub out the blood, then wash in hot water. 

ANIMAL HEAT IN MEATS. 

This is caused by overheating all kinds of animals 
and fowls before killing. There is no remedy for the 
meats when so affected. 

Indications — The fat around the kidneys has a green- 
ish cast ; the round at the hip-bone and the shoulder have 
the same appearance ; the thin parts are not so apt to 
be affected. The meat has also a peculiar sour odor. It 
is more prevalent in summer than in winter, but it often- 
times happens in winter when meats or poultry are 
packed into boxes or barrels when still warm ; then it is 
liable to occur even on the coldest day. 

Prevention — Animals and fowls should be well 
shrunk and be in a normal state at the time of killing, and 
left hanging until the heat escapes, then it is ready to 
pack or be placed into the storage. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 105 



KNIVES. 

Buy them from the butcher supply-houses, for they 
are in position to sell you what you want ; besides you 
get a better article for less money than you can buy in 

ordinary stores. They are made expressly for butchers. 



BLOCKS. 

Blocks should be kept clean. Do not use a brush ; 
use a scraper, as they will keep a block more level, and 
if scraped from the counter, will g-ive the block a white 
appearance. 

To dress the top of a block, stand on end, mark the 
edges around the block where you intend to cut it off; 
use a cross-cut saw well filed, and cut slowly. Next take 
a plane and cut the edges off and scrape the top well. If 
the legs are too short, fit pieces on the bottom, and 
screw on. 



BASKETS. 

Provide the market with plenty of clean baskets. 
Keep the paper in the baskets clean, as nothing you do 
looks more tidy than neat and clean baskets. Remem- 
ber, they are taken into the houses of your best cus- 
tomers. 



ACCOUNTS. 

Make them out the first of each month regardless of 
who and what they are, whether they are large or small, 
as small accounts are oftentimes more easy to collect 
than large ones. 

COLLECTIONS. 

Be prompt with your collections. Attend to them 
closely. Never tell anyone how much money you have. 



106 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



TRUSTING. 

To give credit is not compulsory. It is merely a 
matter of accommodation, and should be appreciated by 
the debtor. He should of his own accord come to you at 
your place of business and liquidate the account, and not 
compel you to coax and beg for what justly belongs to 
you. 

Always ascertain whether a customer is worthy of 
credit before trusting, after giving them credit it is too 
late. 

COUNTERS. 

Counters should have marble slabs. Never lay tools 
or stand crocks on a marble slab. Avoid scratching and 
marring. Nothing looks more tidy and inviting than a 
a neat clean counter. 

TELEPHONE. 

Be prompt in answering. Do not talk any longer 
than is necessary. Someone else may want to call. 

DELIVERING. 

Have good horses, wagons, etc., and most of all, a 
good man. Be exact and prompt. Instruct your man to 
clean the mud from his feet before entering houses, and 
to never meddle with anything in the houses he enters ; 
also to be tidy, clean and polite, as this will please your 
patrons. Be as prompt as possible. 

CREDIT. 

If you are doing a credit business, never give out 
pass-books, as there is more trouble and dispute over 
them than over all the rest of your business combined. 
Use duplicate slips, sending out one with the meat each 
time. Keep them footed up, and your customer will 
know at all times just what they owe, giving them no 
chance whatever to dispute the amount, or claim that 
they did not get this or that. Attend strictly to your 
collections. Allow no one to run a long-winded account. 
Never be afraid to ask even your best customer for 
money, for "he who hesitates is lost." 

Remember it is not compulsory to trust. It is 
merely a matter of accommodation. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 107 



COLLECTING. 

The main feature of collecting is to get the creditor 
started to pay. This is generally done by calling on him 
constantly as no one likes to be dunned. Treat him 
civilly and retain his friendship. Never force a collection 
until you have tried all honorable means. 

Never take a man's note in settlement if he is in- 
tending to leave the city, as it is generally worthless; 
it is but an acknowledgment of the account. An account 
is practically outlawed in seven years. 

To sue a creditor and obtain judgment means to 
keep the account alive for seven years longer. 

Never send a good dollar after a bad dollar. 



EVADING THE QUESTION. 

Lady (newly married)— Have you any lamb fries? 
Clerk — No, not at present. 
Lady — When will you have some? 
Clerk — That I cannot say. 
Lady — But you generally have them. 
Clerk — When we can get them. 
Lady — What kind of meat are they? 
Qerk — They are taken from a lamb. 
Lady — What part of a lamb ? 

Qerk — They are something sim.ilar to sweet breads. 
Lady — But they are good to eat? 
Clerk — Yes, we sell all we get. 
Lady— When you have some I want to get some. 
Clerk — Very well. 

Lady— A friend of mine told me to get some for my 
husband. 

Clerk — Almost faints. 

Lady— Be sure and send me the first you get. Adieu.

It costs money to go to school, also to learn a trade. 

Your ambition should be to be boss some day. Moral

large and some too small. Have you no others? 

Clerk — No, ma'm, these are all we have. 

Lady — What are your ducks like ? 

Clerk — We have some very nice ones. 

Lady — I don't call them nice. Look how fat they

Lady — I think I will have a roast of beef. I suppose 
you have a good roast for me? 

Clerk — Yes, ma'm. How large a roast do you want? 

Lady — Five pounds will be a great plenty. Don't 
make it any more. 

Clerk — It weighs five and one-half pounds. 

Lady — I am sorry now that you did not make it six, 
as I forgot about the company, but we will make it do. 

Clerk — Will I take out the bone and roll it? 

Lady — If you please, and put a large piece of suet in 
the certei. 

Clerk— Will that be all today? 

Lady — Yes. But I wish that the roast was a pound 
larger. ^ Could you sell it to someone and give me about 
six or six and a half pounds? 

Clerk — A roast after it is cut off and rolled is very 
hard to sell, as it may be too large or too small. 

Lady — Well, if I can't get what I want here I will 
trade somewhere else.

no THE MODERN BUTCHER 



LICENSE FOR BUTCHERS. 

Each state should pass a law whereby butchers 
should pay a license, and go before a board of exam- 
iners and be examined as to their competency; the 
examination should consist of : 

1st. Operating a market. . 

2nd. Tending market or cutting of meats. 

3rd. Making of sausage. 

4th. Curing and smoking meats. 

5th. Killing and slaughtering. 

Each applicant should be given a certificate ac- 
cording to what he knows. Then whenever a butcher 
wanted to hire a man he would know something about 
what he was getting, but instead he often buys a cat 
in a bag. 

Aside from this the public would have the satis- 
faction of knowing when they entered a meat market 
that they were being waited on by a butcher who 
thoroughly understood his business and could be de- 
pended on instead of a shoemaker. 



HAWKERS AND PEDDLERS. 

Should be licensed in cities and villages so as to 
make them stand their just share of taxation and put 
them somewhat on an equal footing with the butcher 
who pays rent, taxes, etc., and who remains in busi- 
ness during the whole year. The huckster is generally 
in evidence only at times when meats are cheap or just 
at a time when the butcher could make something; 
also it Vv^^ould reduce the number of hucksters so that 
the huckster who pays for a license would be bene- 
fitted. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 111 



BOARD OF EXAMINERS. 

Each state should have a board of examiners con- 
sisting of five expert, competent butchers (not poli- 
ticians), who should formulate some plan to examine 
all butchers as to their competency and grant them a 
certificate accordingly. Thus doing away with the 
so-called fake butcher who has never learned the 
trade, but who is simply an imposter. , 



BUTCHERS' SOCIETIES. 

Each city or town should have an organization 
for protection and sociability, as the butchers can ac- 
complish more by acting as a unit than they can in- 
dividually, besides the butchers in general are not a 
very neighborly class, oftentimes just a little too jeal- 
ous of their competitor. Your motto should be, "Live 
and Let Live." Organization would rectify many of 
the existing evils in the butcher business. 



ARE WE COMING TO THIS? 

As V/ednesdays and Fridays are generally ob- 
served as fish days and as fish markets are scarce in 
many localities and the butcher is depended on to fur- 
nish all the meat product for the public, and as fish are 
often times hard to obtain, will it ever resolve itself 
into the raising of cattle, hogs, sheep, chickens, etc., 
that will have the fish flavor and may be eaten on these 
lenten days, or will we ever be in a position to offer 
the public some new animals for food such as the 
elephant, giraffe, rhinoceros, lion, etc., instead of 
meats, and a substitute for fish, whale, walrus, sea 
lion or seal. There certainly must be some new kind 
of meat introduced to satisfy the tastes and fancies of 
many.

EVAPORATION OF MEATS. 

A carcass of beef will evaporate or shrink when 
killed about 8 pounds in one day and a like amount in 
the next six days, making a total of 16 pounds in seven 
days, after which the amount of shrinkage will be less. 

Veal, lamb, mutton, pork and poultry will shrink 
about 2 pounds per 100 pounds in the first 24 hours, 
and the next six days about a like amount, making a 
total of 4 pounds to the hundred in seven days. 

Smoked meats will shrink in the first 10 days 
about 3 pounds to the hundred and the next 10 days 
about 1 pound, making a total for 20 days of 4 pounds.

Multiply the weight by the cost price; this will 
give you the cost; then multiply this amount by one 
plus the percentage of profit that you intend to make 
and this will give you the selling price. Example: 
If 100 pounds of pork cost $5.00, what must you sell 
for by the pound to get a profit of 10%? 1st cost 
$5.00; 10% is 50 cents or $5.50 for 100 pounds of 
pork, 5i cents per pound.

REDUCING THE SELLING PRICE OF BEEF. 

To reduce the selling price of beef, loin and ribs 
must increase the selling price of the cheaper cuts in 
order to make a gross profit of 20% ; note the follow-

NOTE — You will notice that as the better cuts 
decline in price the cheaper cuts advance, namely, to 
sell steak or roasts one cent a pound cheaper means 
to add it to the cheaper cuts. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 119 



REDUCING THE SELLING PRICE OF BEEF. 

You will notice by the following table that 
it is almost impossible to reduce the selling price of 
the better cuts of beef without loosing money, as the 
cheaper cuts will not stand the advance ; for instance, 
beef costs 8c, sirloin, etc., sells at 17c and plate at 6c. 
Beef at 8c, sirloin at 14c, plate at 8c, shanks, flanks, 
suet and trimmings, cannot be sold for a much larger 
price when beef costs 8 or 9c than when it costs but 6c.

124 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



On the following page is a table containing the 
approximate expense of conducting a business from 
$10,000.00 to $30,000.00 annually, showing the differ- 
ent amounts that can be expended on a gross profit 
of 20%. While some of the amounts may be a trifle 
high, others may be low, as it would be impossible for 
anyone to compile a table and be exact, to fit all cir- 
cumstances. 

It is compiled chiefly as an object lesson, to con- 
vince many in the meat business that it is impossible 
to do business on a less gross profit than 20%. A 
great many men never draw a stipulated salary from 
their business, merely plod along in a haphazard way 
and take what money is needed, whether the amount 
is large or small. Consequently they never know how 
much money they have drawn from the business or 
how much they have made, or even the amount of 
moneys received during a year. Every man should 
keep an accurate account of all moneys received and 
all moneys expended during the year, keeping all items 
separate, showing the total amount of each separate 
item at the end of the year. This will give you a good 
idea of where the many leaks are which occur in any 
business. This may seem to many a lot of unneces- 
sary work, but it will well repay you in the end.

SPRING LAMB. 

A lamb that is born after January 1st commands 
the best price, about Easter Sunday. Do not remove 
pelt from spring lambs in months of April and May; 
when dressing open the belly from the pouch down 
through the brisket, remove the entrails, leave the 
heart, liver and lungs in the lamb, remove the rectum 
and bladder so as to allow the air to circulate between 
the hams, put a spreader stick in the belly. Usual 
selling price :

HEAD CHEESE. 

To 12 salted pig heads use 10 pounds beef cheek, 
meat hearts or neck trimmings, in fact any meats that 
cannot be worked up in other sausage ; when cooked cut 
into dice or narrow strips, adding a few pig tongues 
cooked and cut into strips; for 100 pounds of meat 
use 8 ounces pepper, 3 ounces corriander, 2 ounces 
whole mustard seed, 1 ounce cloves, 1 ounce cinnamon, 
mix well and add some of the broth in which the meat 
has been cooked, stuff into beef bungs, drop into the 
kettle for 15 minutes, then into cold water for 15 min- 
utes, press tightly between boards. 

NOTE — They can also be hung up and smoked. 



128 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. 

Use 70 pounds of beef preserved for a few days 
with salt and saltpeter; 30 pounds of fresh beef, chop 
very fine, add 20 pounds of water while chopping, 
then take 5 pounds fat pork, cut into very small 
squares, season with 12 ounces black pepper, 2 ounces 
ground corriander, 4 ounces cloves, mix well and let 
it stand in a cool place until the following day; mix 
again and add 10 pounds more water; stuff into beef 
rounds or middles tightly, hang up to dry for a few 
minutes, after which smoke over a hot fire for 30 
minutes or until the casing are dry, then cook in 
hot water until they will float, after which place the 
sausage into cold water for a short time as this will 
shrink the casing and prevents the casing from 
becoming wrinkled. 

NOTE — A small quantity of garlic may be used 
to flavor. 



PORK SAUSAGE, LITTLE PIG. 

Take 100 pounds moderately lean fresh pork 
trimmings, chop very fine, season with 18 ounces salt, 
6 ounces white pepper, 1 ounce ground nutmeg, 1 
ounce allspice, 1 ounce ground celery, 2 ounces ground 
mace, a small quantity of powdered sage; when chop- 
ping add 10 to 15 pounds of water; stuff into small 
hog or sheep casing, making small links for fancy 
trade which can be sold under any fancy name. 

N. B. — In summer time it might be well to use a 
little preservative and but very little sage. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 129 



SUMMER SAUSAGE. 

Take 40 pounds of good lean beef, 40 pounds of 
good lean pork, chop the beef fine, then add the pork 
and chop again, then take 20 pounds of fat pork cut 
into small squares, mix all together, use no water, sea- 
son with 4 ounces saltpeter, 2 pounds of salt, 12 ounces 
coarse ground white pepper, 2 ounces whole mustard 
seed, a little cardamon seed, allow the meat to stand 
in a cold place from 2 to 4 days, turn the chopped mass 
so as to allow it to become thoroughly cold, then mix 
well and stuff tightly into hog bungs, hang up by the 
large end and let them dry for several days, then 
smoke from 3 to 5 days in a cool smoke, soak the case- 
ing well for 24 hours before using so as to make them 
soft and also to remove the salt; keep the sausage in 
a cool, dry place. 



BLOOD SAUSAGE. 

Use 60 pounds fresh cheek or neck pork, 20 
pounds of pig skins, 20 pounds fresh strained hog's 
blood; the pork and skins should be boiled, then chop 
the pork fine and the skins into small squares, then 
mix with the blood, season with 5 ounces pepper, 4 
ounces cloves, 3 ounces allspice and i ounce Marjoram, 
fill loosely into beef middles, then scald in water for 
1 hour below the boiling point, prick occasionally with 
a thin wire ; when the blood stops flowing, the sausage 
is done, hang up to dry for 24 hours, then smoke 
lightly. 



130 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



POLISH SAUSAGE. 

Take 50 pounds of beef trimmings and 25 pounds 
of pork trimmings preserved with 4 ounces saltpeter 
and 1 pound of salt for 5 days, and 25 pounds fresh 
pork trimmings; chop to about half pea size, adding 
while chopping 25 pounds of water, 6 ounces pepper 
and 1 head of garlic rubbed up in salt, fill into hog 
caseing, form into links 8 or 10 inches long and smoke 
over moderate hot fire for 2 hours. 

BOILING HAMS. 

In boiling hams have the water warm before 
placing in the hams, then run the temperature up to 
200° F., after which allow the temperature to drop to 
160°. The hams should cook slowly from 4 to 6 hours, 
after which place them into cold water for ^ hour, 
then place in a cool room to drain. 

N. B. — In cold weather the hams will improve if 
left to cool in the water that they were boiled in. 

BEEF TENDERLOIN. 

Taken from the under side of the loin of beef 
directly under the kidney suet, the most valuable part 
of the beef, costs from 12-J to 22 cents per pound or 
more than twice the cost of beef by the carcass. 

SIRLOIN STRIPS. 

Taken from the top of a loin of beef the entire 
length; cost from 10 to 16 cents per pound; generally 
used by hotels or restaurants for small steaks. This 
strip is boneless. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 131 



SPENCER ROLLS. 

Taken from the back of the beef out of the first 
eight ribs (the eye from the rib roast), this strip is 
boneless and sells from 8 to 14 cents per pound, owing 
to quality and the price of beef used by hotels and 
restaurants for small steaks. 



SMOKED PORK SAUSAGE. 

Take 40 pounds of lean beef preserved for a few 
days with saltpeter, 40 pounds of fairly lean pork pre- 
served the same ; first chop the beef very fine, then add 
the pork and chop again, then add 20 pounds of fresh 
pork, use but a little water, mix well and season with 
12 ounces pepper, 1 ounce cayenne pepper, 3 ounces 
mace, salt to taste, 1 ounce allspice, mix into a stiff 
paste, then stuff into hog caseing, hang them around 
the stick; hang up to dry for 12 hours, smoke over a 
cool fire for 6 hours; pains should be taken to turn 
them on the sticks when in the smoke house so as to 
allow them to smoke even. 

NOTE — Do not link sausage when you want to 
smoke them as they will not smoke in between the 
links. 



WEINERWURST. 

Take 30 pounds of lean beef preserved with salt- 
peter for a few days, 10 pounds of veal, 50 pounds of 
lean pork; chop the beef and veal very fine, then add 
the pork and chop again, add while chopping 25 
pounds of water, season with 10 ounces black pepper, 

2 ounces mace, 1 ounce cinnamon, a little garlic to 
flavor, salt to taste; after chopping set the mass into 
a cool room over night, then mix again into a stiff 
paste, stuff into sheep caseing, tie off in lengths of 

3 to 4 inches, hang up for a while to dry, then smoke 
over a hot fire for 20 to 30 minutes; keep in a cool, 
dry place. 



132 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



TO QUARTER MEATS. 

Beef should be quartered so that the hind quarter 
contains no rib; leave a portion of the flank on the 
front quarter, for this is the proper place to hang up 
a front quarter on a hook, for without the flank it is 
almost impossible to find a place for the hook, as the 
flesh will not bear the weight of the quarter and will 
oftentimes tear out. 



VEAL, LAMB AND MUTTON. 

Should be quartered with one rib on the hind 
quarter as it makes the hind quarter look plump and 
holds the flank straight and does not allow it to draw 
up. 



THE PASSING OF THE OX. 

In years gone by the ox was looked upon as the 
most valuable beef and oftentimes attained the age 
of ten years, at which time he would dress from 800 
to 1,000 pounds of beef, but of late years the baby 
beef has supplanted the ox . The baby beef from one 
to two years old today commands the highest price 
of all beef and is certainly worthy of the distinction. 
There are plenty of yearlings that will dress 450 to 
500 pounds of beef and two-year-olds that dress from 
600 to 800 pounds. These cattle must be fed from 
the day that they are born until the day that they 
are converted into beef; this means a vast outlay of 
money and makes the beef command a price in order 
to reimburse the person who raises them for his 
feed, trouble, etc. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 133 



DRAWN VS. UNDRAWN POULTRY. 

Poultry to be left undrawn should be kept from 
feed for from 24 to 36 hours, at which time the crop 
and intestines will be entirely empty, thus doing away 
with the fermentation which causes the bloating of 
poultry; care should be taken so as to not over heat 
poultry at the time of killing and after killing should 
be hung up in a cool place before placing into a cold 
place so as to allow the animal heat to escape. If 
undrawn poultry is handled properly it will remain 
wholesome for from 10 to 15 days, but if it is drawn 
it will hold up but 5 to 8 days as the decomposition 
starts from the inside of poultry, which is caused by 
the air circulating in and through the same, whereas 
in undrawn poultry which is practically sealed, thus 
excluding the air and keeps the poultry in a wholesome 
condition for a longer period. It is next to impossible 
to ship undrawn poultry in the summer unless packed 
in ice and even then it will not keep for any great 
length of time, for no matter how it is packed, it will 
either get wet or draw dampness from the ice, which 
simply aids decomposition, but the undrawn poultry 
being sealed excludes the water and moisture from the 
inside and can be washed or wiped off and hung up 
in a cold place to dry. 

There should be a law passed compelling people 
to keep poultry and animals that are killed for food 
oif of feed for at least 24 hours. 



GRADING POULTRY. 

In shipping poultry always grade it, put the 
choice poultry in one package, the medium in another 
and keep the poor poultry at home, for if you ship it 
it will merely mean to depreciate the value of the good 
and oftentimes will bring only enough to cover the 
freight and commission, leaving you nothing for the 
poultry. It is by far better to sell them at home and 
get what you can for them. 



134 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU? 

Did you ever stop to think and wonder why some 
or perhaps many of the agents who represent the 
wholesale meat and supply houses never call on you 
to sell you goods? 

The reasons are many. 

First. The house he represents provides him with 
a list of desirable customers who have been doing busi- 
ness with the firm for years, who have paid their bills 
promptly, own property and have a satisfactory rating 
in Dunns or Bradstreets. 

Second. Because they consider him a capable busi- 
ness man, one who knows how to sell goods at a price 
high enough to cover the first cost, together with the 
cost of handling and a percentage of profit besides. 

Third. Because he is a sober and industrious man 
and attends strictly to his business. 

Fourth. Because he is not extravagant and does not 
live beyond his means. In other words no firm cares 
to sell their goods to people who want their capital to 
do business with. The wholesaler is by far more con- 
servative in extending credit than the retailer is. His 
first mission is to look you up and find out what you 
own and how you pay your bills, etc. This should 
also be done by the retailer, but instead he merely 
takes a chance and oftentimes sees his mistake when 
it is too late. The wholesaler is also more prompt in 
his collections than the retailer. Consequently their 
percentage of loss is less than the retailers. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 135 



SHOP TRIMMINGS. 

Trimmings should be taken care of every day and 
not allowed to stand around any great length of time. 
The beef and pork trimmings should be salted sep- 
arately and the pork fat and beef fat should be placed 
upon a rack in the refrigerator so as to keep it dry 
and cold instead of putting into a box or barrel, as it 
is very apt to heat if packed tight into anything and 
setting up fermentation which can be detected in the 
lard, besides making a foul smell in the market when 
rendering. A great amount of a butchers' losses occur 
in not taking proper care of the trimmings. 



EXPORT CATTLE AND BEEF. 

There is but one grade of export cattle, namely, 
the best cattle that the country produces. These cattle 
must weigh from 1,400 to 1,800 pounds alive and fat. 
The strongest cattle are shipped alive and the weaker 
ones are slaughtered and shipped in quarters ; as many 
as 5,000 quarters are often shipped on one refrig- 
erator ship; 1,250 cattle. This beef is mostly all 
shipped to England where it must compete with Eng- 
lish fed beef and commands almost the same price as 
their home fed beef. Bulls are also exported, but 
mostly dressed. Hogs are all shipped in products, such 
as hams, bacon, shoulders, salt-bellies, lard, etc. 



136 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



FIGHTING THE DEAD BEAT THROUGH ASSO- 
CIATIONS. 

There is one class of things that the butcher 
should- well consider, and that is the trade evils, of 
which there are many; but there is one that is more 
annoying and costs the butcher more money than all 
other evils combined, and that is the dead-beat evil. 
If this be true, should it not receive our first attention 
and best efforts to fight it? To remedy this evil we 
must first find out the cause of the dead beat's exist- 
ence. Is it not the price we pay the dead beat that 
keeps him in business? No man would sell his good 
credit, no difference how poor it is, for $5 or $10 ; but 
if he can beat eight or ten butchers out of $10 or $15 
apiece — and that is what he does — it pays him to keep 
at the business. Now for the remedy. We need some- 
thing that will keep him from beating more than one 
butcher. This we can do by means of the card rating 
system, which woudd take away his profit, and there- 
fore drive the delinquent out of business forever. 

To endeavor to explain this card rating system, 
I would say, the cost is so cheap, and the system so 
simple, that it needs only a word and a little thought 
to understand it clearly. It will be run along the 
same line as our lodges of today. If you belong to a 
lodge and go to some other place and wish to join the 
lodge you must present your card to show that you 
were in good standing at the previous one. Same with 
the card rating system. If you leave a butcher and 
want credit at another you must present your card 
from the man you left, showing that you are in good 
standing and worthy of credit. It would not only 
do this, but it would go farther. It would tell you if 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 137 



he was good pay, slow pay, poor pay or didn't pay 
at all, or if his credit is good for $1, $5, $10 or $20, 
or if he pays in full at pay day, or leaves a balance, 
or if he "boozes" or gambles and leaves his bill un- 
paid, and much other valuable information will be 
given through this card system, and the information 
would be reliable as it comes from a brother butcher. 
Gentlemen, we must find the cause of delinquency 
before we can apply the remedy. A ton of fertilizer 
will not help a plant that has a cancer eating out its 
heart. We must destroy the cause before we can 
remedy the effect. Let us, therefore, find the cause 
and apply the remedy— the card system. We read in 
the Scriptures that God created man on the sixth day 
of the week, but, gentlem.en, the business man created 
the dead beat not on the sixth day of the week, but 
in six days in the week. "Every man has his price" 
is an old saying, but as true today as the day it was 
first uttered, and we have paid the dead beat his price, 
and therefore he is with us today. 

Under our present system, when you trust some 
people, and enter the charge on your ledger, you may 
as well begin to sing: 

"A Charge — to — Keep — I — Have." 
Gentlemen, there is but one way to succeed, and 
that is by joining hands with your brother butchers 
and thereby form a universal system of protection 
against dead beats. We need a system that will give 
us the right information at the proper time, and that 
is the card system, for it is the only way we have of 
knowing exactly the standing of the party applying 
for credit at the very moment he asks for the accom- 
modation, and we should also pass resolutions not to 
extend credit to any man under any circumstances 
who is in debt to any butcher and refuses to make sat- 



138 THE MODERN BUTCHER 

isfactory settlement and stick to it. Then you will 
have solved one of the most difficult problems that now 
confronts the business man of today, not only diffi- 
cult, but expensive. 

What does it cost us annually to support the dead 
beat of today, when we come to realize that 20 per 
cent, of this vast population are grafters? I ask you, 
as business men: Is the amount v/e donate the dead 
beat worth saving? It can be done by a co-operative 
card system, and I hope it will be done by the butchers. 
Why ask others to do what we can do ourselves, and 
better than any one else? Let us be men and protect 
ourselves. There is no law that will give us the pro- 
tection we can give each other, except the law that 
does so govern a man's treatment of his brother 
butcher as to help him collect v/hat is due him. 

It is very evident that the dead beat state of af- 
fairs cannot be allowed to continue. The credit system 
as it is today is nothing more or less than a leech 
sucking the life blood of our profits. No business, 
however prosperous, could long withstand the enor- 
mous drain. It is beyond the bounds of possibility for 
a business or a community of business men to stand 
firm when the ground of profit is crumbling beneath 
their feet. Something must be done and done quickly, 
not merely to prevent the growth of dead-beatism, 
but to extirpate it root and branch, and this some- 
thing is to organize and establish a card rating system 
in every city and town throughout the state and the 
United States. One might go on indefinitely enumer- 
ating benefits and profit derived from this card system 
intelligently and vigorously directed. There can be no 
half-hearted work of butchers who expect to win suc- 
cess. Everything must be done forcibly and for the 
sole purpose of making everything count. When this 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 139 



is done there will be less difficulty than now, and the 
business will be upon a more substantial basis. We 
know it is difficult to secure hearty co-operation in any 
effort unless it can be shown that something profit- 
able will result. Not all men insist that the profit 
shall be theirs, but it has come to be almost an im- 
possibility to secure hearty co-operation without some- 
thing in the shape of personal benefit or profits can 
be shown. So far from deprecating this attitude, it 
better might be praised, as the man who takes hold 
of something because it is profitable will be the man 
who will hold on, regardless of difficulties or unpleas- 
ant consequences. If he sees something ahead he will 
do his work and use his strongest effort to achieve 
success. The practical feature of this card system 
must be emphasized. They should be the means of 
securing the benefits which ought to accompany asso- 
ciated effort, and when that is done much will have 
been accomplished toward bringing about the univer- 
sal organization of butchers — something which has 
been discussed frequently, but which has always been 
considered too difficult to succeed. 

The time to stop the dead beat is before he be- 
gins; therefore, are not the dealers themselves to 
blame? They ought to learn from the experience of 
others exactly what will happen if they persist in a 
certain course, and, knowing what has occurred under 
certain given circumstances, they ought to be able 
to judge what will occur again and refuse determin- 
edly to grant credit unless they have ample assurance 
that all previous bills have been paid. A good rating 
system of some kind we know has long been needed. 
There are very many well-meaning business men who, 
while owning that much wrong and evil exists, deny 
their own responsibility for any part of it. Very com- 



140 THE MODERN BUTCHER 

monly we hear business men say: "Yes, it is a pity 
that things are so bad, but it is no fault of ours, and 
nothing we can do will mend them." That is a cow- 
ardly and dishonest excuse. It is the old plea of Cain : 
"Am I my brother's keeper?" No one can shirk his 
responsibility. We are none of us guiltless while this 
evil exists. We are all responsible in some degree for 
every dead beat, and for every grief and loss for 
which, or by which our fellow-butchers suffer. I ask 
you : Have you tried to help it, or have you only lied 
to yourself by saying: "No help is possible." Your 
duty, it seems to me, is clear enough. First of all, 
having seen the evil and wrong exist, it is your duty 
to find out why they exist. Having found out why 
they exist it is your duty to seek for means to abolish 
them. Having found out the means to abolish them, 
it is your duty to apply the means, or if you have not 
yourself the power, it is your duty to persuade others 
to help you. 



SALES AGENT. 

A sales agent should be well versed in the articles 
which he offers for sale, for instance, a man selling 
meats should be a practical butcher, one who is 
thorough and well posted in every detail. But how 
many do you meet that have but a meager knowledge 
of meats? 

The hiring of inexperienced men to sell goods is 
but a detriment to the firm he represents and also to 
the man he sells to, for no man can successfully sell an 
article that he knows nothing about.

TWENTY PER CENT. AND THIRTY PER CENT. 

The tables in this book are based on a gross profit 
of 20%, because it is impossible for a man to attempt 
to do business for less. The rate should be even 
higher, but many seem to think that they are selling 
meats at a profit of 30% or even more. Now, for in- 
stance, a man does a business of $20,000 a year. If 
his expense is 20% all told his goods cost him $16,- 
666.66, and his expense was $3,333.33. Now, if he 
has been selling goods at a profit of 30% and his 
expense was 20% he should have a net profit of 
$1,283.07 or goods. Cost, $15,384.60; expense $3,- 
333.33; net profit, $1,283.07; total, $20,000.00. This 
is merely to illustrate the difference between 20% and 
30%. We will now take it for granted that your ex- 
pense is but 16% and you are selling at a profit of 
20% then we have goods, cost, $16,666.66; expense, 
$2,666.66; net profit, $666.67; total, $20,000.00. The 
expense of retailing meats is from 15 to 22%; this 
largely depends on the amount paid for rent and the 
amount of business done. But it is not at all neces- 
sary that a man should sell everything at a profit of 
20% when he can get 30%. It merely means for him 
to not sell anything for less than 20%, or if he does he 
will lose money. It is a conceded fact that the more 
you get for your goods and the less it costs you to 
sell them the greater your profit is. The most essen- 
tial point in business is to keep your expenses down to 
the lowest notch and guard yourself against the small 
leaks. 



142 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



HIGH PRICE OF MEATS. 

The causes of the high prices of meats are vari- 
ous. First the exports of meats amount to over two 
hundred million dollars annually and are growing 
larger each year. Second, the great plains of the 
West have disappeared where thousands of cattle at 
one time roamed. 

The range cattle will soon be a thing of the past. 
The cattle must be raised on farms, consequently the 
herds are much smaller and the expense of raising 
and feeding will be greater from year to year. 
Third, the great amount of corn we export each 
year takes away the surplus corn that was at one 
time fed to cattle and hogs. Fourth, the increasing 
in values of every other commodity would necessarily 
increase the price of meats some so that there is no 
one direct cause for the high price of meats and also 
no remedy at hand to make meats cheaper. There can 
be but three causes that would make meats cheaper. 
First, if all the foreign countries should place an em- 
bargo on American meats, stopping the exporting of 
meats. Second, if the corn and grain crops should 
increase to any great extent, so as to leave a surplus 
of grain. Third, should a panic come on in the United 
States throwing the laboring classes out of employ- 
ment, thus reducing the home consumption ; either one 
of these three causes would be the cause of overstock- 
ing our markets with meats and cause the prices to 
decline, but with the existing conditions we have to- 
day, the outlook for meats is simply that the prices 
will be higher and higher and with this conceded fact 
before us there is but one thing left for the retailer to 
do, and that is to advance the selling price as the 
wholesale price advances. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 143 



TO CARRY MEATS. 

The proper way to carry a front quarter of beef 
is to put your arm under the shank, take hold of the 
top of the neck with the other hand, bring the quarter 
over your shoulder so that the rib and plate lay flat 
on your back. To carry a hind quarter, carry with 
the shank back of you and the kidney in front with 
the meat side next to your shoulder. Calves, hogs, 
sheep and lambs should always be carried with the 
head end in front of you. 



HOW TO ESTABLISH A CREDIT. 

Pay your bills promptly. Do not buy any more 
stock at a time than you are absolutely certain that 
you can pay for it when it becomes due. Give your 
customers to understand that you cannot extend to 
anyone a long line of credit as you have many to ac- 
commodate and that you must pay your bills when 
they are due. The goods on your shelf or on the hooks 
are oftentimes worth more to you than if they were on 
the books. It is by far better for you to have people 
think that you are rich than for them to know that 
you are poor. The public expects charity but will give 
none. When you sell goods below cost you will have 
customers and friends, but when you fail they will be 
grieved, not grief for you, but that they have lost their 
cheap trading place. When you once prove to the sell- 
ing public that you possess the above qualifications 
you will then establish a credit and obtain a rating 
accordingly, after which every salesman will be 
anxious to sell you goods because the firm he repre- 
sents will authorize him to call on you and will extend 
to you a line of credit according to your rating. 



144 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



PRESERVATIVES. 

Since the law has gone into effect prohibiting the 
use of preservatives other than saltpeter it places the 
butcher in rather a peculiar position regarding the 
making of sausage ; while summer sausage, bologna and 
frankforts can be preserved with saltpeter, it cannot 
be used successfully in pork sausage, consequently 
there should be some harmless preservative made that 
could be used in pork sausage, but at this time there 
is no such product on the market. Hamburg steak will 
not hold up to color unless some preservative is used; 
head cheese and liver sausage can be preserved with 
saltpeter. If the government insists that the butchers 
refrain from using preservatives it will simply mean 
to make sausage every day. 



INSPECTION OF MEAT. 

No doubt the intention of the law is to inspect 
each carcas and each piece of meat that is offered for 
sale by the large packing plants and this inspection 
should take place before the article is boxed or crated, 
but without a doubt there are hundreds of boxes and 
barrels sealed long before they are inspected. The 
inspector merely passes on the package and not on 
the contents. But the local conditions are still worse, 
especially in the small cities where there are no in- 
spectors, where everything is beef, pork, veal, poultry, 
etc., regardless of quality. Every city of any size 
should have an inspector, a man who would do justice 
to the office and condemn everything that was un- 
wholesome and injurious to the public health. 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 145 



PTOMAINE POISON VS. PRESERVATIVES. 

Since the government has passed the pure food 
law and prohibited the use of preservatives in sausage, 
etc., there has been about 1,000 cases of ptomaine 
poisoning per month and now the question arises 
which will kill the most people, the poison or the pre- 
servatives. Preservatives were intended to be used 
in meats, vegetables, etc., when they were in perfect 
condition and was to keep them in perfect condition 
or to keep them from deteriorating and fermenting, 
keeping them in a sweet, wholesome condition. Per- 
haps the preservatives are somewhat injurious to the 
public health, but the small quantity consumed daily 
by a person would amount to but a trifle compared 
with ptomaine poison. It has been proven that where 
preservatives have been used in the preparation of 
sausage and vegetables that ptomaine poison does not 
exist. If so, ptomaine poison is caused by not using 
preservatives. Now, it is not impossible for a butcher 
to make sausage even in the summer without preser- 
vatives, he must simply make fresh sausage every 
day, and even then suppose that a customer buys 
fresh made pork sausage, takes it home in warm 
weather, allows it to remain in a warm place for a 
few hours and then places it into a cold storage for a 
day or two, it will then be in a fermented state and 
the poison is apt to be prevalent; now, under these 
circumstances, who is to blame, would it not be far 
better for the government to allow the moderate use 
of preservatives and prevent the ptomaine poisoning? 



146 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



H0¥/ TO HANDLE CUSTOMERS. 

A man who has money is always independent, it 
matters not where or with whom he does his trading. 
He may be exact and perhaps has a right to be and 
he should be left to choose his own cuts and decide for 
himself as to whether he wants the cheaper or better 
cuts. Do not try to induce him to buy what he does 
not want; if so, you are very apt to lose a customer, 
but should he leave the article for you to choose for 
him, endeavor to give him something that will please 
him and charge him all the article is worth, for if 
it pleases him he will not mind the price he paid for 
the same and will tell the neighbors where to go and 
buy their meats, but if you disappoint him, he will 
tell them to the contrary. Be very exact in your lan- 
guage and manner to ladies, as they are very touchy 
and easily offended; bid they the time of day and ask 
them in a kind tone of voice what they wish to pur- 
chase, never forgetting the smile which will perhaps 
be answered by one. When you wait on children 
treat them kindly and you will always have a friend, 
for as they grow up they will remember their father's 
butcher. Wait on customers as their turn comes; 
should some one wish to be waited on before their 
turn you might possibly step up to one of your cus- 
tomers and ask them to wait, which in most cases, 
would be satisfactory, but if you should not ask the 
customer to wait he might feel offended. It is cer- 
tainly a ticklish proposition to please everyone, but 
try to please as many as you can, be courteous and 
polite to all ; when you have a customer that you do not 
want tell him by word of mouth and not by actions, 
and state your reasons why. When you have cheap 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 147 

cuts or bargains, you can sell them to the poor. If you 
v/ill study your customers you can always find some 
who will buy these cheap cuts as long as the price is 
right and the goods are wholesome. A man that pays 
his bills promptly should be treated as a cash customer 
and a man that is too slow for credit or never pays his 
bills should not be trusted. 



CHARGING MEATS. 

When meats are charged always charge in the 
following manner: 6^ lbs. Roast Beef, 94; 2 lbs. 
Steak, 36, etc., instead of Roast 94, Steak 36, as the 
customer has a right to know how many pounds they 
have purchased and what the price has been per 
pound. This you will find to be more satisfactory to 
your customers and will save you many explanations. 



THE OBLIGING CLERK. 

There are a great many clerks who have gotten 
into the habit of rebating customers, for instance, a 
customer purchases 52 cents worth or 94 cents worth 
or any amount where the change is odd; instead of 
taking the 52 cents or 94 cents they will call it 50 or 
90 cents; while this is but 2 or 4 cents off the pur- 
chase price we will take it for granted that this clerk 
sells to 100 customers in a day, the amount he gives 
away will amount to from 2 to 4 dollars a day or per- 
haps it will amount to $500 in a single year. If you 
are selling honest goods and giving 16 ounces to the 
pound and sell at a legitimate profit, you are entitled 
to every cent that is coming to you and customers 
should not expect anything more. 



148 THE MODERN BUTCHER 



FEEDING THE POOR. 

Why should the butcher alone feed the poor? 

¥/hy should he be forced to carry their accounts? 

Why must he offer a warm heart for a cold 
shoulder ? 

Why should they live in luxury and extravagance 
in the summer? 

Why should they live in want and destitution in 
the winter? 

Would it not be better to teach them economy and 
lay up a dollar for a rainy day? 

Many are to be pitied because they are poor; cir- 
cumstances and conditions may have brought this 
about, while some alone are to blame for their con- 
ditions. The feeding of the poor by extending to them 
credit has been the downfall of many a butcher ; while 
it is right to practice charity, begin at your own home 
first; remember your family, wife and children. Many 
a worthy person has been refused credit, but how can 
we distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. It is 
a hard matter to determine. Mismanagement brings 
on at times hardship upon the poor classes, extrava- 
gance another cause, while even some never seek a 
situation, but wait for the situation to seek them. 
Some again love to live in poverty and pauperism, 
filth and rags, but these are not only the conditions 
of today, but have been for the last two thousand years, 
and when will it ever cease? The poor are always 
dependent on the butcher for the first four months of 
the year, just at a time when meats are the highest 
and the profits small, so that no butcher can afford to 
take many chances on losing any large amounts, as 
the profits are entirely too small to warrant the wait- 



THE MODERN BUTCHER 149 

ing six months for his pay and taking chances besides. 
If a man goes to a money loaner to borrow he must 
give security to protect the lender; when a man buys 
meat from you on a long account he should protect 
you likewise. This may seem to some as drawing the 
lines rather hard, but nevertheless a man must at all 
times protect his own interests. Much more could be 
written on this subject. 

For the half has never been told. 



THE AGEING OF MEATS. 

This is a very difficult problem to solve; fat beef, 
pork, veal, lamb, chickens, etc., will hold up longer 
than anything that is lean. Lean meats do not im- 
prove by hanging; they, after a day or two, dry out, 
and become slimy and stale, thus getting worse in- 
stead of better. 

Fat beef and mutton can be hung up from 5 to 
10 days and will improve in eating quality as the 
fibers and muscles relax and the meat becomes firm 
and more nutritious and easier digested. Fat veal and 
pork should hang from 3 to 5 days, just long enough 
to let it stiffen up and get firm. Poultry, when drawn, 
will hang from 3 to 5 days, but when undrawn it will 
hang for 10 days.. Ail meats and poultry should be 
killed at least 24 hours before cutting up to sell. 

In winter all kinds of meats and poultry can be 
hung up for a longer period. Meats should be kept 
at a temperature of 30° to 38°. Do not freeze meats 
or poultry, as this is injurious, as it becomes flimsy 
and destroys the flavor and saps away the juice, 
making it dry and chippy after it is cooked and almost 
tasteless.

SALTPETER AS A PRESERVATIVE. 

Salt peter has been used as a preservative for 
generations and if taken in sufficient quantities is a 
poison, but the small quantities consumed by eating 
cured meats may be practically termed a benefit to 
the human system; the action of saltpeter on the hu- 
man system is similar to that of sweet spirits of 
nitre; it works mostly on the urinary organs; for in- 
stance, a person that lives principally on smoked and 
salted meats is generally in better health than one who 
lives on steaks and chops. The chemical action from 
the salt and saltpeter give life and strength to the 
body, whereas the softer meats, as fresh pork, veal, 
chickens, etc., will oftentimes cause billiousness, indi- 
gestion, dyspepsia, etc. Saltpeter is almost as much 
of a necessity to the human system as salt.

THE AUTHOR. 

The author of this book was born as other human 
beings. His parents were poor. He had a common 
school education. Won the respect and esteem of his 
employers and also of the public. Worked hard and 
saved a portion of his earnings and put it to practical use. 
Never made an investment but what earned him money. 
Always ready to give and take advice, and never too old 
to learn. What he has belongs to him, and he intends to 
keep it. It is his and he has won it, by his labor. Some 
people do not lie because they do not know how. The 
writer knows how, but don't. The truth is far better. 

For reference, any bank or banker in Bay City, or 
Dunns or Bradstreet. He never jokes, because he don't 
know how. When he has troubles he keeps them to him- 
self. Never listens to a man's tale of woe. Life is too 
short. Stories he knows by the score. Never buys any- 
thing he don't want, even a gold brick. Never drinks 
unless he is dry, and then it is water ; this is the cheapest, 
and best for the brain. Now and them he smokes a 25 
cent cigar — when the beef trust agents buy them. Has 
been in politics, and always been defeated, because he 
did not let go (of his money). Has been behind fast 
horses — when they were in the baggage cars. Has gone 
fishing and fell in, but never came up with a pocket full 
of fish. Has gone without grub — because he did not have 
time to eat it. Never indorsed a note that he had to pay. 
Never bet on another man's game. Owns a farm, and 
sometimes looks a little seedy, but 'tis not the clothes 
that makes the man. Now he has told you nearly all he 
knows. 

What he is worth and how much he makes he keeps 
to himself, for if he tells someone that, his friends would 
want to borrow money of him, and the assessors would 
soak him for taxes ; but he has enough to keep the wolf 
from the door for the rest of his days.

CONCLUSION. 

You will notice that the time for you to maKe money 
!s -when meats are cheap. You can easily at that time 
make more than 20 per cent, so if you do not then take 
advantage of the situation, you have no one to blame but 
yourself, for as the price advances your opportunity is 
lost. You can rest assured that if your competitor is un- 
der selling you, he is either selling cheaper meats or 
losing money. The day is drawing nearer when there 
will be an almost universal price among the meat men. 
Only the experienced men will be in business. The 
farmers and shoemakers will go back to their trade sadder 
i;ut wiser. 

Keep good meats and sell at a good living profit and 
a little more for a rainy day. 

A living you can earn working for others without 
any worry or money invested. 

Hoping you will meet with success, I am 

Yours, 

J. F. BOES,
