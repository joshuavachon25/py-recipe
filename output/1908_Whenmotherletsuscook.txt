PREFACE 

To make something that we can eat ! Surely it is 
always delightful to do this, and never quite so nice 
as when it is a stormy day, and one is — 'well — ten or 
twelve years old. My aim has been to give in this 
little book a few simple rules and receipts, which may 
serve as a beginning, and help small folks to have 
their fun without troubling mother and the cook too 
much; yet I trust that these directions may prove 
useful to them even when they are grown-up house- 
keepers. 

The selection is made with a view to economy and 
a child's diet.

WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



THINGS TO HAVE 

Tablespoons, teaspoons, measuring cup, 

Bowls, plates, knives, all polished up. 

Egg-beater, lifting knife, baking tin, 

Sauce-pans, bread-board, rolling-pin; 

A double-boiler, a chafing-dish, 

A wooden spoon I know you'll wish. 

A flour sifter, a cutter, too ; 

A clock to show when the cooking 's through. 

An apron to do the cooking in. 

And hands scrubbed clean before you begin ! 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



THE WITCH'S TEST 

Put eggs in cold water to test them for food. 
If they float they are bad, if they sink they are 

good. 
And some people say that an egg is all right 
If you hold it up close to a flame that is bright 
And look through it endwise and still see a light.

WAITING EULE 



Make your friends wait if there's any delay, 
But never your omelet, cakes or souffle, 
For friends will not spoil, but the other things 
may! 




WHEN MOTHER LETS ITS COOK 21 

SWEET OMELET 

4 eggs Chafing-dish or double- 
3 teaspoonfuls pow- boiler 

dered sugar Teaspoon 

% teaspoonful va- Egg-beater 

nilla extract Spatula 

Teaspoonful butter 2 bowls for mixing 

Fork 

Take 2 eggs and separate the whites and yolks. 
Put the whites in one bowl and the yolks in an- 
other. 

Add to the yolks 2 whole eggs, 3 generous tea- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and ^/^ teaspoonful 
vanilla. Beat with an egg-beater imtil very light. 

Put some boiling water in the under pan of 
our chafing-dish or double boiler. A chafing- 
dish is the best, for it is easier to serve the ome- 
let in the dish in which it is cooked, and you can- 
not do this with an ordinary double boiler. 

Be sure that the lamp in your chafing-dish is 
lighted. 

In the upper pan drop a teaspoonful of butter 
and as it melts spread it over the pan with a 
spoon so that the sides as well as the bottom are 
greased. 

Whip the 2 remaining wliites with an egg- 



22 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

beater until very stiff, and mix them with the 
rest of the eggs, very carefully with a fork. 

Pour into the buttered pan, cover the pan and 
cook it without touching for 15 minutes. 

Serve at once, in the same pan. 

If you use a double boiler, loosen the sides of 
the omelet with a spatula, or flexible knife, so 
that it will come away from the pan, fold half 
of it over the other half and turn out upon a hot 
plate. 

This is enough for 3 people. 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 23 

CEREAL CAKES 

Any cooked cereal Iron sauce-pan 
Tablespoonful of Turning knife, or 

butter spatula 

Mixing bowl 

Some day when there is cooked oatmeal, or 
hominy or rice, left over from breakfast, ask 
your mother to let you make it into a lunch dish. 

Take a small iron saucepan and put it on the 
hot part of the stove. It should get very hot. 

Take the cold cereal in your hands and mould 
it into little cakes about the size of fish-balls. 

Put a piece of butter as big as a sugar-lmup 
into the hot saucepan, and as soon as it is all 
melted, lay the little cakes into the pan. 

At the end of one minute lift up one of the 
cakes with your turning knife and if the under- 
side has a brown crust on it, turn the cake over. 

Do the same with each cake, until all are nicely 
browned on both sides. They should be eaten 
right away, with sugar or maple syrup on them.

PAN CAKES 

1 teaspoonful baking Fork 
powder 1 teaspoon 

11/2 cups flour 2 mixing bowls 

2 eggs Measuring cup 
1 cup milk Egg-beater 

1 teaspoonful salt Flour sifter 

Butter Saucepan 

Spatula 
Wooden spoon 

Take 2 eggs and break tliem carefully so that 
the whites and yolks shall be separate, and put 
the yolks in one bowl, the whites in another. 

Beat the whites stiff with your egg-beater, and 
then beat the yolks. 

Sift some flour into your measuring cup until 
you have 1% cupfuls. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of baking powder and 1 
teaspoonful of salt. 

Before doing anything else, put your frying- 
pan on a hot part of the stove. 

Sift your flour mixture into the bowl with the 
egg yolks, and stir them together with a wooden 
spoon. 

Measure 1 cupful of milk, and add this to the 
flour and egg ; stir it in a little at a time and beat 
the mixture well with the wooden spoon.

WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 25 

There must be no Ixmips in the batter. 

Last of all mix in your beaten egg whites care- 
fully with a fork. 

Put about 1/2 a teaspoonful of butter into your 
hot pan, leaving it on the stove. 

When the butter is melted pour into the pan 
1 tablespoonful of the batter. 

Spread this out quickly so that the batter in 
the pan will be very thin, and let the cake cook 
until it is brown on the under side. 

The hotter your pan, the quicker the batter 
will cook, and the better your pancake will be. 

You can lift up a corner to see if it is done, if 
you do this carefully with a spatula. 

When the cake is done on one side, turn it 
quickly and carefully with the spatula, and 
brown on the other side. 

Never turn a cake more than once. It spoils it. 

When both sides of the cake are done, lift it 
out of your pan and put it on a hot plate. 

Make the rest of the cakes in the same way, 
as rapidly as possible, and serve at once with 
sugar and butter, or with maple sugar or ma]3le 
syrup, or with cream. 

You may have to add a little butter to your 
pan if you find it is getting dry.

BAKING EITIE 

When you bake a small thing, have the oven hot, 
But for baking big things, cool it off a lot.

put them whole into a deep dish. Sprinkle each 
one mth a pinch of sugar, a pinch of cinnamon 
and a pinch of cloves. 

Cover the bottom of your dish with an inch of 
cold water, and set in a hot oven to sinmier. This 
usually takes 3 hours. If the water dries off,

a *^ pinch" of cinnamon, and a bit of butter about 
the size of half a lump of sugar. 

Pour about 1 cup of hot water into the pan, 
and set in a moderate oven. 

It is almost impossible to say how long to 
leave them in ! 

They are done when they are soft and juicy, 
probabl}^ in about I/2 hour. 

Stick a fork into them and try them when you 
think they are done. 

Put them in a pretty plate or bowl with all 
the syrup that has been cooked out of them, and 
serve with cream or milk.

NEST EGG 

Eggs Mixing bowl 

Salt Egg-beater 

Pepper Baking bowl 

Spoon 

Take a nice, fresh egg, and ask the cook to 
show you how to break it open carefully, and 
separate the white and the yolk, so that the yolk 
mil not be broken. Leave the yolk in a half 
egg-shell, and let the white fall into a mixing 
bowl. 

Add a pinch of salt to the white, and beat with 
an egg-beater until it is very stiff. 

Have ready some little bowl or deep saucer 
that is pretty enough to put on the table, and yet 
will not break in the oven. 

Into this dish pour the stiff-beaten white, and 
make a little hole in the middle of the white 
with a spoon. 

In this little hollow place put the yolk, still 
unbroken. 

Set the dish in a hot oven and cook for two or 
three minutes, or until the white is a little brown 
and the yolk is firm. 

Serve right away.

an egg-beater until it is very light. 

Add to this 2 tablespoonfuls of granulated 
sugar and 2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, and 
mix them all together. 

Pour over this 1 quart of milk and mix well. 

Strain the water from the tapioca and add the 
tapioca to the mixture, and pour the whole into 
a pretty baking dish of some sort. 

Bake for one hour in a moderate oven. 

Serve cold in the same dish, with sugar and

Pepper 




Salt 




Bread crumbs 





Take some cold fish, say enough to make 1 
pint, and pick it to pieces with a silver fork. Be 
sure to take out every bone. 

Make a cream sauce, as you have learned to 
do, with 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 tablespoonful 
of butter and 1 cup of milk. Use a saucepan or 
double boiler and be careful not to let it burn. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper. 

Put your fish into the saucepan with the sauce, 
mix it all up well, and take from the stove. 

Take a baking dish and butter the sides and 
bottom carefully. 

Turn the fish into the baking dish. 

Have ready about % a cup of stale bread 
crumbs, add to them a pinch of salt and a smaller 
pinch of pepper, mix them all up, and sprinkle

and put the dish in a pretty hot oven to brown. 
This should take about fifteen minutes, but it 
might take less or more according to the heat of 
the oven. 

Take the fish out when the top is brown, and 
serve right away. 

This can be baked in little dishes or in large 
shells.

EICE f UDDING 

4 tablespoons rice Mixing bowl 

4 tablespoons sugar Strainer or sieve 

Nutmeg Enamel baking dish 
1 quart milk 

Take 4 tablespoonfuls of rice, pick out all the 
specks and dried kernels and wash it by putting 
it in a strainer or sieve and letting clean, cold 
water run over it. 

Put the washed rice into a bowl, and add 4 
tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. 

Pour over the rice 1 quart of good milk. 

Turn the mixture into a baking dish. The 
pudding will be creamier if you use an enameled 
metal one, but you can use china. 

Grate over the top some nutmeg, and set the 
dish in a moderate oven. 

Cook for about 2 hours. From time to time as 
the pudding begins to get brown on top, stir 
•down the top crust. Do this twice. When the 
rice is thoroughly soft it is done. 

Eice pudding is better served quite cold. 

If you like raisins, get some of the seedless 
kind, measure about 2 tablespoonfuls and soak 
them in boiling w^ater for 5 minutes. Drain off 
the water and stir them into the pudding before 
you put it into the oven.

Now add your flour and milk a little at a time 
and beat the whole until it is quite smooth and 
free from lumps. 

Before doing anything more examine your 
oven and if you want to make a loaf cake have 
a moderate oven. If you are going to make little 
cakes you will want a hot one. 

Butter your tins well, using either a big tin for 
loaf cake or a muffin tin for little ones. 

Measure 2 teaspoonf uls of baking powder and 
add them to the dough. Last of all add the 
beaten whites of the eggs, mix them in with a

BREAD-AND-BUTTER RULE 

Butter your bread before you slice 
If you want your sandwich nice. 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 63 

SCHOOL SANDWICHES 

To make good sandwiches it is necessary to 
have bread that is at least a day old, a sharp 
knife, and soft butter. Soften your butter by 
putting it in a dish at the back of the stove for a 
few minutes. 

Butter your loaf of bread before cutting off 
each slice and cut the slices thin. Lay the but- 
tered slices neatly together and trim off the 
crusts. Various fillings can be used ; any kind of 
cold meat, chopped up fine, cheese, jam, jelly, or 
slices of hard boiled egg. 

You can make a most delicious sandwich out of 
thin slices of brown bread, with a filling of the 
cottage cheese on page 67. Cottage cheese mixed 
with a little jam is a delicious filling for white 
bread sandwiches. 

A slice of plain cake and a slice of buttered 
bread together make a very good combination.

FAIBY SALAD 

1 head lettuce Dish pan 

Sugar Sharp knife

Choose a nice head of lettuce, one that has no 
faded leaves and that seems solid. 

Carefully pull the leaves from the stem, so that 
the tender white ends will come off too. 

Cut off the flat white root if it is headed let- 
tuce. Most people do not like it. 

Throw away any tough or faded leaves and put 
the tender fresh leaves into a dish pan filled with 
cold water. 

Leave the lettuce in this for half an hour or 
more, then take it out, and shake off the water 
carefully. Sometimes you may need to use a 
cloth to dry the leaves. 

Take an orange, slice it with a sharp knife and 
cut off the skin. Try not to lose any juice. 

Put the lettuce leaves into a dish, lay the 
orange slices on them, and sprinkle the whole 
with y^ a cup of granulated sugar. 

Put the bowl in the ice closet for a short time, 
and serve very soon. 

If you have a big orange it is better to cut the 
slices in small i:)ieces.

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Pint or more of sour Glass milk bottle or 

milk pitcher 

Salt Mixing bowl 

Tablespoonful fresh Half -yard of white 

milk cheese-cloth 

If your mother will let you have some sour 
milk or cream, it is very easy to make cottage 
cheese. 

Put the sour milk into a glass milk bottle, or 
pitcher, and let it stand in a warm room, until it 
begins to curd; that is, until the thick part is 
very thick and lumpy, and there is a little thin 
liquid at the bottom. 

This may take twelve hours, or it may take as 
much as two days. 

Then stand the bottle at the back of the stove, 
to heat slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
until the thick part and the liquid are entirely 
separate. 

Now take a piece of white cheese-cloth, as big 
as a table napkin, lay this over a bowl, and pour 
the whole mixture into the cloth. 

Gather up the corners of the cheese-cloth and 
tie them together, making a sort of loose bag. 
Let this hang suspended over the bowl for 



68 WHEN :mother lets vs cook: 

twenty-four hours, thus allowing the thin liquid 
to drip away, and the cheese to di\y. 

The water in the bowl can be thrown away, o] 
given to the dog. It is good for him. 

Take the firm ball of cheese out of its bag, pu^ 
it in a dish, and just before you want to serve it 
soften it by mixing into it a tablespoonful ol 
fresh milk into which you have put a pinch oi 
salt. 

This ought to be nicer cheese than you can bu^ 
at any store, and is very good eaten with jam and 
bread-and-butter.

The clams are very nice to eat just as they are, 
with salt and pepper and butter, but if you do not 
care for them they can be given to the cat or dog, 
who will probably appreciate them. 

Put into the broth 1 teaspoonful of salt and 1/4

Put it back into the pot and stand on the stove 
to get really hot again but do not let it boil up.

MILK TOAST 

Bread Toaster or toasting 

Butter fork 

2 cupfuls milk Saucepan 

Salt and pepper Measuring cup 

Knife 

First make your toast ; this is best done over a 
hot fire, with a toaster, but you can make quite 
good toast in the oven. 

Cut enough thin slices of bread for your 
guests, allowing about two a piece. Stale bread 
is better than fresh. 

Lay these slices on a toaster, if you have one, 
or hold them one at a time on a long fork. 

Take off one of the stove covers and toast your 
bread over a hot fire until one side is brown, and 
then toast it on the other side. 

Be sure not to burn it. 

If you use the oven, lay the bread in a pan. 

If the fire is not hot the toast will be tough and 
hard. This is generally the trouble when toast 
is made m the oven, or when it is made before 
you want to use it. 

Butter your toast evenly, and lay it in a hot 
dish. 

Sprinkle a pinch of salt and one of pepper 
over each piece. 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 73 

Heat 2 cupfuls of milk in a saucepan, until it 
steams. 

Pour the hot milk over the toast and serve at 
once in the same dish. 

If you use more than 8 pieces of toast you will 
need more milk. 

Cream toast can be made by using the sauce 
described on page 7 instead of the hot milk. In 
this case don't put the salt and pepper on the 
toast.

BLACKBEERY BEEAD 

1 loaf stale bread Sharp bread knife 

Butter Broad knife 

1 quart blackberries Saucepan 

Sugar Spoon 
% cup cold water 

Take a loaf of stale bread, butter one end, and 
cut off a thin slice. The bread must be quite 
stale. Continue to butter and slice until you 
have used the whole loaf. It is always easier 
and nicer to butter your bread before slicing. 

Put 1 quart of blackberries in a saucepan with 
about 1 cupful of granulated sugar and % cup of 
cold water. Sinuner the berries imtil they are 
tender, and the juice is running freely. 

This will probably take about fifteen minutes. 
Stir from time to time. Put a layer of buttered 
bread into a deep dish and pour some of the hot 
stewed berries over it, then more bread and more 
blackberries in layers until all are used. 

Put the dish in a cold place until the berries 
have cooled and then set on ice for a while. 

Serve in the same dish with cream or milk. 

Strawberry, raspberry or cherry bread can be 
made in the same way. Use more sugar with the 
sour berries, less with sw^eet.

2 bananas Mixing spoon 

1 cup sugar Measuring cup 

% lemon Lemon squeezer 

Take 2 fine juicy oranges and cut them, with- 
out peeling, into thin slices, across the grain. 

Cut them carefully over some dish, with a 
sharp knife, so as not to lose any of the juice. 

Trim the hard outside skin away and lay th( 
slices in a pretty glass or china bowl. If yoi 
have any juice that spilled while you were cut- 
ting the oranges, pour this in too. 

Sprinkle % cup sugar over the oranges. 

Take 2 firm bananas, peel off the skin, and cu 
the fruit into slices about as thick as your finger 
and lay them on top of the orange slices. If yoi 
have any apples or other fruit, it is nice to ad( 
some slices, but be sure to peel and stone th 
fruit, and never let any seeds drop into the dist 

Squeeze % lemon into the dish, and sprinkl 
over the whole another % cup of sugar. 

Leave the dish in a moderately warm room f o 
2 hours, then mix up the fruit with a spoon, an 
put it on ice. Serve in the same dish. 

This is enough for three.

JEUY WHIP 

Whites of 3 eggs Mixing bowl 

3 tablespoonfuls Tablespoon 

powdered sugar Teaspoon 
% cup currant jelly 

Separate carefully the whites and yolks of 3 
eggs. Put the yolks away in a cup for some fu- 
ture use. 

Put the whites in a bowl and beat with an egg- 
beater until very stiff and light. 

Get some currant, or raspberry, or strawberry 
jelly, and measure about % cupful. Add this to 
the egg-whites, one teaspoonful at a time, beat- 
ing the mixture between each additional tea- 
spoonful of jelly. 

When all the jeUy is mixed with the egg, beat 
it a few minutes more for good luck, and to make 
sure that it is all light and fluffy. 

Heap it in a dish or into small glasses and 
serve it right away. 

This should be more than enough for three 
people. 

Be careful, when putting in the jelly, to add a 
very little at a time, or it will make the egg 
heavy, so that you cannot beat it.

BOILING BULE 

Boil your water hard to brew 
Tea that's good, and cocoa too. 
Tea itself should not be boiled; 
Boil your cocoa or it's spoiled! 




WHEN MOTHER LETS V^ COOK 81 

WAYS TO MAKE GOOD TEA 

In order to make good tea you must use water 
that is really boiling hard. 

First heat your tea-pot by pouring some hot 
water into it. 

Empty it and put in your tea, 1 teaspoonful 
for each cup. 

If you want to make four cups of tea, pour 1 
cup of boiling water into the pot onto your tea 
and let it stand for 3 minutes. Then add the 
other 3 cups of boiling water and let it stand for 
1 minute. 

Serve at once with sugar and cream, or sugar 
and slices of lemon. 

Never let tea stand on the tea grounds. If you 
are not ready to drink the tea when it is done, 
pour it into another pot or pitcher through a 
strainer. 

You can make very good tea by using a tea- 
ball. Put your tea into the tea-ball and put the 
tea-ball into the individual cups ; pour the boil- 
ing water over and when the tea is strong enough 
remove the tea-ball. This has the advantage of 
never letting the tea stand on the leaves or 
grounds. 

If you want to make a great quantity of tea. 



82 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

for a reception or party, a very good thing to do 
is to make a number of little cheese-cloth bags 
and fill them with tea. These can be put into 
your tea-pot and when the tea is strong enough 
can be removed, in that way keeping the tea 
fresh during a long period of time. 

It is also possible to make a very thick tea 
syrup, by pouring a small quantity of boiling 
water over a large quantity of tea, and after it 
has stood for 3 minutes pouring it off into a 
tea-pot. This will keep for a day and can be 
diluted with hot water whenever a cup of tea is 
wanted. Put a small quantity in the cup, and 
pour as much hot water over it as is needed. 
This water does not need to be boiling, only 
hot, as the tea itself was made with boiling 
water. 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 83 

HOW TO MAKE ONE CTJP OF COCOA 

1 teaspoonful cocoa Tablespoon 

1 tablespoonful boil- Measuring cup 
ing water Saucepan 

Yo pint milk 

1 teaspoonful gran- 
ulated sugar 

Take a teaspoonful of cocoa, and put it in a 
tin cup. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of granulated sugar and one 
tablespoonful boiling water from the kettle. 

Mix it well so that there will not be any lumps 
of cocoa. 

Pour a little less than I/2 pint of milk into a 
saucepan and cook it, stirring all the time until it 
is scalded ; that is, until a film forms on it and it 
just begins to bubble. 

Stir the cocoa mixture into this, and cook it 
imtil it boils up. 

It burns very easily, so stir it carefully. 

Pour into a large cup and serve. To keep the 
cup from cracking, put a teaspoon in it before 
you pour in the hot cocoa.

POPPITY CORN 

Ears of popcorn Deep saucepan with 

A little oil or butter cover 
or lard 

Ordinary popcorn is made with a corn-popper. 
Poppity Corn is made in a deep covered dish on 
the stove, and is much fluffier and lighter. 

The most important thing is to have fresh pop- 
corn. Old corn is hard and small after it is 
popped. It is always best to get popcorn on the 
ear and shell it yourself. 

Take the deep saucepan and put two or three 
tablespoonf uls of salad oil, or butter or lard in it, 
and % teaspoonful of salt. The bottom should 
be barely covered. 

Put the dish on a hot part of the stove, and 
when the oil is very hot indeed throw in a hand- 
ful of popcorn, and put the cover on. 

While the corn is popping you may shake the 
dish a little, but it does not need to be shaken 
hard. When the corn is all popped the oil will 
be gone, and you can empty the corn onto a plate. 

A bowl of popcorn and milk is very good. 

A bowl of popcorn with a little melted butter 
stirred into it is a dish that many people like. 



86 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

POPCORN BAILS 

Have a bowl of popped corn all ready. 

Put in a saucepan half a cupful of granulat< 
sugar and 4 tablespoonfuls of water, and pla 
on a hot part of the stove. Boil this until j' 
have a thick syrup that will be hard when test' 
in cold water. 

Put the pan at the back of the stove where t 
syrup will keep hot but not boil anymore. Pi 
up pieces of popcorn, one by one, and dip the 
into the syrup and stick them together, addi] 
more and more of them until you have made 
ball. Let these harden in a cold place.

87 



POPCORN PATTIES 

Boil together 1 cup of sugar and ^ cupful of 
molasses, until it is thick and Avaxy when a few 
drops are tested in cold water. 

Stir into this a quart of popped corn. Have 
ready a cold buttered plate. 

Spoon up heaping spoonfuls of the mixture 
and drop them in little patties onto the plate. 
Set in a cold place to harden.

CANDIED ORANGE-PEEL 

Peel of 6 oranges Bowl 

2y2 cups granulated Saucepan 

sugar Spoon 

Water Fork 

1 teaspoonful salt Sharp knife 

Put about 1 quart of cold water into a bo^vl 
and add to it 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Keep the bowl of water in a cold place and put 
into it orange peelings as you get them. It is 
all right to use what is left from the table. 

Scrape off all of the pulp and most of the inner 
white skin with a sharp knife. 

Leave the peel in the salt water for a few days, 
adding more peel. When you have the peel from 
about 6 oranges, pour off the salt water and wash 
the peel with fresh water so that any salt taste 
may be washed away. Cut the peel into short 
narrow strips, about 2 or 3 inches long and as 
wide as your little finger. 

Put the peel into a saucepan and pour over it 
1 quart of cold water. 

Set the saucepan on a hot part of the stove and 
cook the peel until it is soft. This may take an 
hour or more. 

Try it with a fork to see if it is done, and when 



WHEN MOTHEE LETS US COOK 89 

it is, take the pan from the stove. Add to the 
water and peel about 1 pint more cold water, or 
enough to have a quart of water altogether, with 
what is left in the saucepan, and put 2 cups of 
granulated sugar in with it. 

Set the pan on the stove again and let the 
water and sugar cook until the water has nearly 
boiled away, leaving the peel covered with a 
thick syrup. 

This will take some time. 

Take the pan off the stove. 

Put some granulated sugar on a plate and 
drop the orange peel, piece by piece, into the 
sugar and roll it with a fork so that it will be well 
coated. 

tWhen the peel is cold it is ready to eat.

RAINY-DAY FUDGE 

2 cups granulated Measuring cup 

sugar Chafing-dish or 

1 cup milk saucepan 

Butter Knife 

Teaspoonful vanilla Stirring spoon 

% pound chocolate, Teaspoon 

or 4 heaping Glass of cold water 

tablespoons cocoa Greased paper or pan 

Measure 2 cups of granulated sugar and put it 
in a saucepan with 1 cup of milk. Add a lump 
of butter about the size of a lump of sugar. 

Put the pan on a hot part of the stove, and 
while the milk is heating, cut up % pound of 
chocolate into little pieces. 

If you use cocoa, put 4 heaping tablespoonfuls 
right in with the milk, without waiting. Choco- 
late and cocoa must both be unsweetened. 

When the milk and sugar in the pan begin to 
get smoking hot, add your chocolate. 

Cook for 15 or 20 minutes, stirring all the 
time. 

Be sure that the pan is on a hot part of the 
stove and that you stir it well so that it will not 
burn. 

When you think it's done, try it and see. Dip 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 91 

a little out with a teaspoon and drop it in a glass 
of cold water. If it gets thick and stiff, you may 
be sure the rest is done. 

Take the pan off the stove, add 1 teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract and beat it together with a 
spoon for three minutes. 

Take your greased paper and lay it on a plate, 
or better still, take the baking tin which you have 
smeared with butter, and pour over it the hot 
fudge. 

Leave the fudge in a cold place to harden. 

When it is perfectly firm, cut it into squares 
with a sharp knife. 

It should be about % an inch thick, so do not 
try to fiU too large a pan. 

It is not always necessary to cook fudge for 20 
minutes, so it is just as well to try it after 10 or 
15 minutes. 

This receipt makes nearly a pound of candy.

MOLASSES CANDY 

1 cupful molasses Measuring cup 

1 cupful brown sugar Tablespoon 

1 tablespoonful vin- Saucepan 
egar Pans 

2 tablespoonf Ills Glass or cup 
butter 

Take a large saucepan and put into it 1 cupful 
of molasses, 1 cupful of brown sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter. 

Set the saucepan on a hot part of the stove and 
when the mixture boils, look at the clock and let 
it boil for about 15 miimtes. 

Test a spoonful of it in a glass of cold water. 
If the mixture becomes hard and breakable at 
once, it is done. It should be much harder than 
the peppermint syrup. 

Rub a shallow baking tin with butter and into 
this pour the mixture at once. 

Put the ]3an in a cool place. 

As soon as the mixture is cold enough to touch 
without burning your fingers, spoon out pieces 
as big as your fist and have each person take one 
of the pieces. 

Pull it apart with your two hands and twist it, 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



93 



and pull it, until it gets a nice light yellow and is 
so stiff that you can't pull it any more. 

Twist it into long thin ropes and let them get 
entirely hard on buttered plates in the ice chest. 
Then break into short pieces for eating. 

This makes enough for four children to pull. 

It is very important to have your hands clean 
before you begin pulling the candy.

PEPPEEMINT DROPS FOR TWO CHILDREN TO MAKE 

2 cupfuls sugar Measuring cup 

1 cupful water Saucepan 

1 teaspoonful extract Teaspoon 
of peppermint Two thick glasses 

Brown paper 

Measure 2 cupfals of granulated sugar and 
put it in a saucepan. 

Add 1 cupful of cold water, and set the pan on 
a hot part of the stove. 

When it comes to a boil, look at the clock and 
boil for about 20 minutes, stirring from time to 
time. 

When you think it's done, try a little, by drop- 
ping half a teaspoonful into a glass of cold 
water. 

If it is done it will get stringy and hard in the 
water. 

When you are sure that it is ready, take the 
pan from the stove, and pour the syrup into two 
glasses. 

Pour % teaspoonful of peppermint extract at 

once into each glass and let each child stir the 

mixture in his glass rapidly with a teaspoon until 

the syrup gets thick and creamy white. 

^ Have a large flat sheet of brown wrapping 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



95 



paper ready on your kitchen table and onto this 
drop little round dabs of the mixture as rapidly 
as possible. 

Don't let the mixture get too cool and stiff by 
stirring it longer than necessary. 

When entirely hard and cold, the peppermints 
can be lifted off with a knife. 

This makes about half a pound.

PEEFACE 

To make something that we can eat ! Surely it is 
always delightful to do this, and never quite so nice 
as when it is a stormy day, and one is well ten or 
twelve years old. My aim has been to give in this 
little book a few simple rules and receipts, which may 
serve as a beginning, and help small folks to have 
their fun without troubling mother and the cook too 
much; yet I trust that these directions may prove 
useful to them even when they are grown-up house- 
keepers. 

The selection is made with a view to economy and 
a child's diet. 



iz 



MOTHER LETS US COOK 



THINGS TO HAVE 

Tablespoons, teaspoons, measuring cup, 

Bowls, plates, knives, all polished up. 

Egg-beater, lifting knife, baking tin, 

Sauce-pans, bread-board, rolling-pin; 

A double-boiler, a chafing-dish, 

A wooden spoon I know you '11 wish. 

A flour sifter, a cutter, too ; 

A clock to show when the cooking 's through, 

An apron to do the cooking in, 

And hands scrubbed clean before you begin! 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



THE WITCH'S TEST 

Put eggs in cold water to test them for food. 
If they float they are bad, if they sink they are 

good. 

And some people say that an egg is all right 
If you hold it up close to a flame that is bright 
And look through it endwise and still see a light. 




WHEN MOTHER LETS ITS COOK 3 

BOILED EGGS 

Fresh eggs Saucepan 

Boiling water 

Never boil eggs that are not perfectly fresh; 
cook them some other way. 

Put your fresh eggs, with their shells on, into 
a deep saucepan. 

Fill the saucepan with water that is actually 
boiling, and see that the eggs are covered. 

Take the pan from the stove and cover it. It 
may be brought to the dining room table, and the 
eggs will cook until you are ready to eat them. 

Boiled eggs are better cooked in water that 
does not continue to boil; but be sure that the 
water is boiling hard, when first poured over the 
eggs. 

Three minutes will be enough for soft boiled 
eggs, fifteen for hard. 

Serve at once in a covered dish, or wrapped in 
a clean table napkin. 



[WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



BOILED BICE 

1 cup rice Measuring cup 

3 quarts boiling Sieve 

water Teaspoon 

1 teaspoonful salt Deep saucepan 

Fork 

Measure 1 cupful of rice. Pick it over care- 
fully so that there will be no yellow grains or 
specks of dirt left in it. 

Then put the rice into a sieve or strainer and 
wash it. You can do this under the kitchen fau- 
cet or by pouring a pitcherful of cold water over 
the rice. 

Put 3 quarts of hot water into a deep sauce- 
pan on the stove (the pan should have a cover) 
and when the water boils pour in the rice very 
slowly, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Stir it a few times with a fork and then put 
the cover on the pan, and let the rice boil hard 
for about twenty minutes, or until it is soft. 

Try a little with a fork when you think it is 
done. 

Drain the water off by pouring rice and all 
into your sieve. 

This is the best way to cook rice.

JELLY WARM-OVER 

3 tablespoonfuls cur- Saucepan or chafing- 

rant jelly dish 

Cold beef or mutton Spoons 
Pepper and salt 
French mustard 

If you have any cold beef or mutton left over 
from yesterday, cut it into rather thick slices. 

Take your saucepan and put it on a hot part 
of the stove. 

Put in your saucepan 1 heaping tablespoonful 
of butter, and as soon as it is melted add ^ tea- 
spoonful of salt and a pinch of red pepper, mix- 
ing it well with a spoon. If you like, add 1 
teaspoonful of French mustard. 

Stir into this 3 generous tablespoonfuls of cur- 
rant jelly. 

When it is all smoking hot and well mixed, add 
your slices of meat. 

Cook for a few more minutes until the meat is 
heated through and has absorbed some of the 
sauce. 

Serve in a hot dish at once. Be sure to pour 
all the jelly sauce over the meat.

Put 1 tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan, 
and put the saucepan on the stove. 

When the butter is melted add 1 tablespoonful 
of flour. 

Stir every minute, for it burns easily. 

When the butter and flour are frothy and well 
mixed, pour in 1 cup of milk or cream, drop by 
drop, stirring with the other hand. 

Do this quickly, but be very careful not to let 
any lumps form; the stirring is to prevent this, 
and also to keep the sauce from burning. 

Cook it till it boils up, and then stir in 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt and ^4 teaspoonful of pepper. 

The sauce is now ready for use. 

This is enough for a dish for three people. It 
can be used with warmed-over meats, fish, toast, 
or sliced hard-boiled eggs.

STEWED FRUITS 

When stewing fruits, do not let them boil hard. 
They should only simmer. 

Cover the fruit with cold water and add sugar 
if the fruit is sour. 

The saucepan should be put at the back of the 
stove and the fruit cooked until tender. This 
often takes from 2 to 3 hours. 

Never use tin pans to cook fruit.

But never your omelet, cakes or souffle, 
For friends will not spoil, but the other things 
may!

Add to the yolks 2 whole eggs, 3 generous tea- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and y 2 teaspoonful 
vanilla. Beat with an egg-beater until very light. 

Put some boiling water in the under pan of 
your chafing-dish or double boiler. A chafing- 
dish is the best, for it is easier to serve the ome- 
let in the dish in which it is cooked, and you can- 
not do this with an ordinary double boiler. 

Be sure that the lamp in your chafing-dish is 
lighted. 

In the upper pan drop a teaspoonful of butter 
and as it melts spread it over the pan with a 
spoon so that the sides as well as the bottom are 
greased. 

Whip the 2 remaining whites with an egg-

rest of the eggs, very carefully with a fork. 

Pour into the buttered pan, cover the pan and 
cook it without touching for 15 minutes. 

Serve at once, in the same pan. 

If you use a double boiler, loosen the sides of 
the omelet with a spatula, or flexible knife, so 
that it will come away from the pan, fold half 
of it over the other half and turn out upon a hot

Some day when there is cooked oatmeal, or 
hominy or rice, left over from breakfast, ask 
your mother to let you make it into a lunch dish. 

Take a small iron saucepan and put it on the 
hot part of the stove. It should get very hot. 

Take the cold cereal in your hands and mould 
it into little cakes about the size of fish-balls. 

Put a piece of butter as big as a sugar-lump 
into the hot saucepan, and as soon as it is all 
melted, lay the little cakes into the pan. 

At the end of one minute lift up one of the 
cakes with your turning knife and if the under- 
side has a brown crust on it, turn the cake over. 

Do the same with each cake, until all are nicely 
browned on both sides. They should be eaten 
right away, with sugar or maple syrup on them.

Take 2 eggs and break them carefully so that 
the whites and yolks shall be separate, and put 
the yolks in one bowl, the whites in another. 

Beat the whites stiff with your egg-beater, and 
then beat the yolks. 

Sift some flour into your measuring cup until 
you have 1% cupfuls. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of baking powder and 1 
teaspoonful of salt. 

Before doing anything else, put your frying- 
pan on a hot part of the stove. 

Sift your flour mixture into the bowl with the 
egg yolks, and stir them together with a wooden 
spoon. 

Measure 1 cupful of milk, and add this to the 
flour and egg ; stir it in a little at a time and beat 
the mixture well with the wooden spoon. 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 25 

There must be no lumps in the batter. 

Last of all mix in your beaten egg whites care- 
fully with a fork. 

Put about l /2 a teaspoonful of butter into your 
hot pan, leaving it on the stove. 

When the butter is melted pour into the pan 
1 tablespoonful of the batter. 

Spread this out quickly so that the batter in 
the pan will be very thin, and let the cake cook 
until it is brown on the under side. 

The hotter your pan, the quicker the batter 
will cook, and the better your pancake will be. 

You can lift up a corner to see if it is done, if 
you do this carefully with a spatula. 

When the cake is done on one side, turn it 
quickly and carefully with the spatula, and 
brown on the other side. 

Never turn a cake more than once. It spoils it. 

When both sides of the cake are done, lift it 
out of your pan and put it on a hot plate. 

Make the rest of the cakes in the same way, 
as rapidly as possible, and serve at once with 
sugar and butter, or with maple sugar or maple 
syrup, or with cream. 

You may have to add a little butter to your 
pan if you find it is getting dry.

BAKING RULE 

When you bake a small thing, have the oven hot, 
But for baking big things, cool it off a lot.

put them whole into a deep dish. Sprinkle each 
one with a pinch of sugar, a pinch of cinnamon 
and a pinch of cloves. 

Cover the bottom of your dish with an inch of 
cold water, and set in a hot oven to simmer. This 
usually takes 3 hours. If the water dries off, 
add a little more. 

They are done when soft. Serve with cream 
or milk. 

You can also use hard, green cooking pears,

Grate over the top some nutmeg, and set the 
dish in a moderate oven. 

Cook for about 2 hours. From time to time as 
the pudding begins to get brown on top, stir 
down the top crust. Do this twice. When the 
rice is thoroughly soft it is done. 

Eice pudding is better served quite cold. 

If you like raisins, get some of the seedless

Now add your flour and milk a little at a time 
and beat the whole until it is quite smooth and 
free from lumps. 

Before doing anything more examine your 
oven and if you want to make a loaf cake have 
a moderate oven. If you are going to make little 
cakes you will want a hot one. 

Butter your tins well, using either a big tin for 
loaf cake or a muffin tin for little ones. 

Measure 2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder and 
add them to the dough. Last of all add the 
beaten whites of the eggs, mix them in with a

WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 63 

SCHOOL SANDWICHES 

To make good sandwiches it is necessary to 
have bread that is at least a day old, a sharp 
knife, and soft butter. Soften your butter by 
putting it in a dish at the back of the stove for a 
few minutes. 

Butter your loaf of bread before cutting off 
each slice and cut the slices thin. Lay the but- 
tered slices neatly together and trim off the 
crusts. Various fillings can be used ; any kind of 
cold meat, chopped up fine, cheese, jam, jelly, or 
slices of hard boiled egg. 

You can make a most delicious sandwich out of 
thin slices of brown bread, with a filling of the 
cottage cheese on page 67. Cottage cheese mixed 
with a little jam is a delicious filling for white 
bread sandwiches. 

A slice of plain cake and a slice of buttered 
bread together make a very good combination.

Choose a nice head of lettuce, one that has no 
faded leaves and that seems solid. 

Carefully pull the leaves from the stem, so that 
the tender white ends will come off too. 

Cut off the flat white root if it is headed let- 
tuce. Most people do not like it. 

Throw away any tough or faded leaves and put 
the tender fresh leaves into a dish pan filled with 
cold water. 

Leave the lettuce in this for half an hour or 
more, then take it out, and shake off the water 
carefully. Sometimes you may need to use a 
cloth to dry the leaves. 

Take an orange, slice it with a sharp knife and 
cut off the skin. Try not to lose any juice. 

Put the lettuce leaves into a dish, lay the 
orange slices on them, and sprinkle the whole 
with y 2 a cup of granulated sugar. 

Put the bowl in the ice closet for a short time, 
and serve very soon.

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Pint or more of sour Glass milk bottle or

Salt Mixing bowl 

Tablespoonful fresh Half -yard of white 

milk cheese-cloth 

If your mother will let you have some sour 
milk or cream, it is very easy to make cottage 
cheese. 

Put the sour milk into a glass milk bottle, or 
pitcher, and let it stand in a warm room, until it 
begins to curd; that is, until the thick part is 
very thick and lumpy, and there is a little thin 
liquid at the bottom. 

This may take twelve hours, or it may take as 
much as two days. 

Then stand the bottle at the back of the stove, 
to heat slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
until the thick part and the liquid are entirely 
separate. 

Now take a piece of white cheese-cloth, as big 
as a table napkin, lay this over a bowl, and pour 

the whole mixture into the cloth. 

Gather up the corners of the cheese-cloth and 

tie them together, making a sort of loose bag. 
Let this hang suspended over the bowl for

WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



twenty-four hours, thus allowing the thin liquid 
to drip away, and the cheese to dry. 

The water in the bowl can be thrown away, or 
given to the dog. It is good for him. 

Take the firm ball of cheese out of its bag, put 
it in a dish, and just before you want to serve it, 
soften it by mixing into it a tablespoonful of 
fresh milk into which you have put a pinch of 
salt. 

This ought to be nicer cheese than you can buy 
at any store, and is very good eaten with jam and 
bread-and-butter.

The clams are very nice to eat just as they are, 
with salt and pepper and butter, but if you do not 
care for them they can be given to the cat or dog, 
who will probably appreciate them. 

Put into the broth 1 teaspoonful of salt and %

Salt and pepper Measuring cup 

Knife 

First make your toast ; this is best done over a 
hot fire, with a toaster, but you can make quite 
good toast in the oven. 

Cut enough thin slices of bread for your 
guests, allowing about two a piece. Stale bread 
is better than fresh. 

Lay these slices on a toaster, if you have one, 
or hold them one at a time on a long fork. 

Take off one of the stove covers and toast your 
bread over a hot fire until one side is brown, and 
then toast it on the other side. 

Be sure not to burn it. 

If you use the oven, lay the bread in a pan. 

If the fire is not hot the toast will be tough and 
hard. This is generally the trouble when toast 
is made in the oven, or when it is made before 
you want to use it. 

Butter your toast evenly, and lay it in a hot 
dish. 

Sprinkle a pinch of salt and one of pepper 
over each piece. 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



73 



Heat 2 cupfuls of milk in a saucepan, until it 
steams. 

Pour the hot milk over the toast and serve at 
once in the same dish. 

If you use more than 8 pieces of toast you will 
need more milk. 

Cream toast can be made by using the sauce 
described on page 7 instead of the hot milk. In 
this case don't put the salt and pepper on the 
toast.

1 quart blackberries Saucepan 

Sugar Spoon 
% cup cold water 

Take a loaf of stale bread, butter one end, and 
cut off a thin slice. The bread must be quite 
stale. Continue to butter and slice until you 
have used the whole loaf. It is always easier 
and nicer to butter your bread before slicing. 

Put 1 quart of blackberries in a saucepan with 
about 1 cupful of granulated sugar and % cup of 
cold water. Simmer the berries until they are 
tender, and the juice is running freely. 

This will probably take about fifteen minutes. 
Stir from time to time. Put a layer of buttered 
bread into a deep dish and pour some of the hot 
stewed berries over it, then more bread and more 
blackberries in layers until all are used. 

Put the dish in a cold place until the berries 
have cooled and then set on ice for a while.

WAYS TO MAKE GOOD TEA 

In order to make good tea you must use water 
that is really boiling hard. 

First heat your tea-pot by pouring some hot 
water into it. 

Empty it and put in your tea, 1 teaspoonful 
for each cup. 

If you want to make four cups of tea, pour 1 
cup of boiling water into the pot onto your tea 
and let it stand for 3 minutes. Then add the 
other 3 cups of boiling water and let it stand for 
1 minute. 

Serve at once with sugar and cream, or sugar 
and slices of lemon. 

Never let tea stand on the tea grounds. If you 
are not ready to drink the tea when it is done, 
pour it into another pot or pitcher through a 
strainer. 

You can make very good tea by using a tea- 
ball. Put your tea into the tea-ball and put the 
tea-ball into the individual cups; pour the boil- 
ing water over and when the tea is strong enough 
remove the tea-ball. This has the advantage of 
never letting the tea stand on the leaves or 
grounds. 

If you want to make a great quantity of tea, 



82 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



for a reception or party, a very good thing to do 
is to make a number of little cheese-cloth bags 
and fill them with tea. These can be put into 
your tea-pot and when the tea is strong enough 
can be removed, in that way keeping the tea 
fresh during a long period of time. 

It is also possible to make a very thick tea 
syrup, by pouring a small quantity of boiling 
water over a large quantity of tea, and after it 
has stood for 3 minutes pouring it off into a 
tea-pot. This will keep for a day and can be 
diluted with hot water whenever a cup of tea is 
wanted. Put a small quantity in the cup, and 
pour as much hot water over it as is needed. 
This water does not need to be boiling, only 
hot, as the tea itself was made with boiling 
water.

HOW TO MAKE ONE CUP OF COCOA 

1 teaspoonful cocoa Tablespoon 

1 tablespoonful boil- Measuring cup 
ing water Saucepan 

1/2 pint milk 

1 teaspoonful gran- 
ulated sugar 

Take a teaspoonful of cocoa, and put it in a 
tin cup. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of granulated sugar and one 
tablespoonful boiling water from the kettle. 

Mix it well so that there will not be any lumps 
of cocoa. 

Pour a little less than y 2 pint of milk into a 
saucepan and cook it, stirring all the time until it 
is scalded; that is, until a film forms on it and it 
just begins to bubble. 

Stir the cocoa mixture into this, and cook it 
until it boils up. 

It burns very easily, so stir it carefully. 

Pour into a large cup and serve. To keep the 
cup from cracking, put a teaspoon in it before 
you pour in the hot cocoa.

POPPITY CORN 

Ears of popcorn Deep saucepan with 

A little oil or butter cover 
or lard 

Ordinary popcorn is made with a corn-popper. 
Poppity Corn is made in a deep covered dish on 
the stove, and is much fluffier and lighter. 

The most important thing is to have fresh pop- 
corn. Old corn is hard and small after it is 
popped. It is always best to get popcorn on the 
ear and shell it yourself. 

Take the deep saucepan and put two or three 
tablespoonfuls of salad oil, or butter or lard in it, 
and 14 teaspoonful of salt. The bottom should 
be barely covered. 

Put the dish on a hot part of the stove, and 
when the oil is very hot indeed throw in a hand- 
ful of popcorn, and put the cover on. 

While the corn is popping you may shake the 
dish a little, but it does not need to be shaken 
hard. When the corn is all popped the oil will 
be gone, and you can empty the corn onto a plate. 

A bowl of popcorn and milk is very good. 

A bowl of popcorn with a little melted butter 
stirred into it is a dish that many people like. 



86 WHEN MOTHER LETS us COOK 

POPCORN BALLS 

Have a bowl of popped corn all ready. 

Put in a saucepan half a cupful of granulated 
sugar and 4 tablespoonfuls of water, and place 
on a hot part of the stove. Boil this until you 
have a thick syrup that will be hard when tested 
in cold water. 

Put the pan at the back of the stove where the 
syrup will keep hot but not boil anymore. Pick 
up pieces of popcorn, one by one, and dip them 
into the syrup and stick them together, adding 
more and more of them until you have made a 
ball. Let these harden in a cold place.

POPCORN PATTIES 

Boil together 1 cup of sugar and % cupful of 
molasses, until it is thick and waxy when a few 
drops are tested in cold water. 

Stir into this a quart of popped corn. Have 
ready a cold buttered plate. 

Spoon up heaping spoonfuls of the mixture 
and drop them in little patties onto the plate. 
Set in a cold place to harden.

CANDIED ORANGE-PEEL 

Peel of 6 oranges Bowl 

2^ cups granulated Saucepan 

sugar Spoon 

Water Fork 

1 teaspoonful salt Sharp knife 

Put about 1 quart of cold water into a bowl 
and add to it 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Keep the bowl of water in a cold place and put 
into it orange peelings as you get them. It is 
all right to use what is left from the table. 

Scrape off all of the pulp and most of the inner 
white skin with a sharp knife. 

Leave the peel in the salt water for a few days, 
adding more peel. When you have the peel from 
about 6 oranges, pour off the salt water and wash 
the peel with fresh water so that any salt taste 
may be washed away. Cut the peel into short 
narrow strips, about 2 or 3 inches long and as 
wide as your little finger. 

Put the peel into a saucepan and pour over it 
1 quart of cold water. 

Set the saucepan on a hot part of the stove and 
cook the peel until it is soft. This may take an 
hour or more. 

Try it with a fork to see if it is done, and when 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

it is, take the pan from the stove. Add to the 
water and peel about 1 pint more cold water, or 
enough to have a quart of water altogether, with 
what is left in the saucepan, and put 2 cups of 
granulated sugar in with it. 

Set the pan on the stove again and let the 
water and sugar cook until the water has nearly 
boiled away, leaving the peel covered with a 
thick syrup. 

This will take some time. 

Take the pan off the stove. 

Put some granulated sugar on a plate and 
drop the orange peel, piece by piece, into the 
sugar and roll it with a fork so that it will be well 
coated. 

When the peel is cold it is ready to eat.

RAINY-DAY FUDGE 

2 cups granulated Measuring cup 

sugar Chafing-dish or 

1 cup milk saucepan 

Butter Knife 

Teaspoonful vanilla Stirring spoon 

,% pound chocolate, Teaspoon 

or 4 heaping Glass of cold water 

tablespoons cocoa Greased paper or pan 

Measure 2 cups of granulated sugar and put it 
in a saucepan with 1 cup of milk. Add a lump 
of butter about the size of a lump of sugar. 

Put the pan on a hot part of the stove, and 
while the milk is heating, cut up *4 pound of 
chocolate into little pieces. 

If you use cocoa, put 4 heaping tablespoonfuls 
right in with the milk, without waiting. Choco- 
late and cocoa must both be unsweetened. 

When the milk and sugar in the pan begin to 
get smoking hot, add your chocolate. 

Cook for 15 or 20 minutes, stirring all the 
time. 

Be sure that the pan is on a hot part of the 
stove and that you stir it well so that it will not 
burn. 

iWhen you think it's done, try it and see. Dip 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



91 



a little out with a teaspoon and drop it in a glass 
of cold water. If it gets thick and stiff, you may 
be sure the rest is done. 

Take the pan off the stove, add 1 teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract and beat it together with a 
spoon for three minutes. 

Take your greased paper and lay it on a plate, 
or better still, take the baking tin which you have 
smeared with butter, and pour over it the hot 
fudge. 

Leave the fudge in a cold place to harden. 

When it is perfectly firm, cut it into squares 
with a sharp knife. 

It should be about % an inch thick, so do not 
try to fill too large a pan. 

It is not always necessary to cook fudge for 20 
minutes, so it is just as well to try it after 10 or 
15 minutes. 

This receipt makes nearly a pound of candy. 







92 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

MOLASSES CANDY 

1 cupful molasses Measuring cup 

1 cupful brown sugar Tablespoon 

1 tablespoonful vin- Saucepan 
egar Pans 

2 tablespoonfuls Glass or cup 
butter 

Take a large saucepan and put into it 1 cupful 
of molasses, 1 cupful of brown sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter. 

Set the saucepan on a hot part of the stove and 
when the mixture boils, look at the clock and let 
it boil for about 15 minutes. 

Test a spoonful of it in a glass of cold water. 
If the mixture becomes hard and breakable at 
once, it is done. It should be much harder than 
the peppermint syrup. 

Hub a shallow baking tin with butter and into 
this pour the mixture at once. 

Put the pan in a cool place. 

As soon as the mixture is cold enough to touch 
without burning your fingers, spoon out pieces 
as big as your fist and have each person take one 
of the pieces. 

Pull it apart with your two hands and twist it, 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



93 



and pull it, until it gets a nice light yellow and is 
so stiff that you can't pull it any more. 

Twist it into long thin ropes and let them get 
entirely hard on buttered plates in the ice chest. 
Then break into short pieces for eating. 

This makes enough for four children to pull. 

It is very important to have your hands clean 
before you begin pulling the candy.

PEPPERMINT DROPS FOR TWO CHILDREN TO MAKE 

2 cupfuls sugar Measuring cup 

1 cupful water Saucepan 

1 teaspoonful extract Teaspoon 

of peppermint Two thick glasses 

Brown paper 

Measure 2 cupf uls of granulated sugar and 
put it in a saucepan. 

Add 1 cupful of cold water, and set the pan on 
a hot part of the stove. 

When it comes to a boil, look at the clock and 
boil for about 20 minutes, stirring from time to 
time. 

When you think it's done, try a little, by drop- 
ping half a teaspoonful into a glass of cold 
water. 

If it is done it will get stringy and hard in the 
water. 

When you are sure that it is ready, take the 
pan from the stove, and pour the syrup into two 
glasses. 

Pour % teaspoonful of peppermint extract at 
once into each glass and let each child stir the 
mixture in his glass rapidly with a teaspoon until 
the syrup gets thick and creamy white. 

Have a large flat sheet of brown wrapping

j 

paper ready on your kitchen table and onto this 
drop little round dabs of the mixture as rapidly 
as possible. 

Don't let the mixture get too cool and stiff by 
stirring it longer than necessary. 

When entirely hard and cold, the peppermints 
can be lifted off with a knife. 

This makes about half a pound.

PREFACE 

To make something that we can eat ! Surely it is 
always delightful to do this, and never quite so nice 
as when it is a stormy day, and one is — well — ten or 
twelve years old. My aim has been to give in this 
little book a few simple rules and receipts, which may 
serve as a beginning, and help small folks to have 
their fun without troubling mother and the cook too 
much; yet I trust that these directions may prove 
useful to them even when they are grown-up house- 
keepers. 

The selection is made with a view to economy and 
a child's diet 



.WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



TfllAGS TO HAVE 

Tablespoons, teaspoons, measuring cup, 

Bowls, plates, knives, all polished up. 

Egg-beater, lifting knife, baking tin, 

Sauce-pans, bread-board, rolling-pin; 

A double-boiler, a chafing-dish, 

A wooden spoon I know you 11 wish. 

A flour sifter, a cutter, too; 

A clock to show when the cooking 's through. 

An apron to do the cooking in, 

And hands scrubbed clean before you begin! 




2 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



THE WITCH'S TEST 

Put eggs in cold water to test them for food. 
If they float they are bad, if they sink they are 

good. 
And some people say that an egg is all right 
If you hold it up close to a flame that is bright 
And look through it endwise and still see a light. 




WHEN MOTHEB LETS US COOK! 3 

BOILED EGGS 

Fresh eggs Saucepan 

Boiling water 

Never boil eggs that are not perfectly fresh; 
cook them some other way. 

Put your fresh eggs, with their shells on, into 
a deep saucepan. 

Fill the saucepan with water that is actually 
boiling, and see that the eggs are covered. 

Take the pan from the stove and cover it. It 
may be brought to the dining room table, and the 
eggs will cook until you are ready to eat them. 

Boiled eggs are better cooked in water that 
does not continue to boil; — but be sure that the 
water is boiling hard, when first poured over the 
eggs. 

Three minutes will be enough for soft boiled 
eggs, fifteen for hard. 

Serve at once in a covered dish, or wrapped in 
a clean table napkin.

BOOED BICE 

1 cup rice Measuring cup 

3 quarts boiling Sieve 

water Teaspoon 

1 teaspoonful salt Deep saucepan 

Pork 

Measure 1 cupful of rice. Pick it over care- 
fully so that there will be no yellow grains or 
specks of dirt left in it. 

Then put the rice into a sieve or strainer and 
wash it. You can do this under the kitchen fau- 
cet or by pouring a pitcherful of cold water over 
the rice. 

Put 3 quarts of hot water into a deep sauce- 
pan on the stove (the pan should have a cover) 
and when the water boils pour in the rice very 
slowly, and add 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Stir it a few times with a fork and then put 
the cover on the pan, and let the rice boil hard 
for about twenty minutes, or until it is soft. 

Try a little with a fork when you think it is 
done. 

Drain the water off by pouring rice and all 
into your sieve. 

This is the best way to cook rice.

JELLY WABX-OVER 

3 tablespoonfuls cur- Saucepan or chafing- 

rant jelly dish 

Cold beef or mutton Spoons 
Pepper and salt 
French mustard 

If you have any cold beef or mutton left over 
from yesterday, cut it into rather thick slices. 

Take your saucepan and put it on a hot part 
of the stove. 

Put in your saucepan 1 heaping tablespoonf ul 
of butter, and as soon as it is melted add % tea- 
spoonful of salt and a pinch of red pepper, mix- 
ing it well with a spoon. If you like, add 1 
teaspoonful of French mustard. 

Stir into this 3 generous tablespoonfuls of cur- 
rant jelly. 

When it is all smoking hot and well mixed, add 
your slices of meat. 

Cook for a few more minutes until the meat is 
heated through and has absorbed some of the 
sauce. 

Serve in a hot dish at once. Be sure to pour 
all the jelly sauce over the meat.

For cooking milk two rules I tell,- 
Milk quickly burns, so stir it well ; 

Or cook it in a double pot, — 

It curdles where the stove's too hot.

CEEAM SAUCE FOB AIL SOETS OF THINGS 

1 tablespoonful flour Saucepan or chafing- 

1 tablespoonful but- dish 
ter Spoon 

1 cupful milk Measuring cup 

1 teaspoonful salt 

y± teaspoonful pep- 
per 

Put 1 tablespoonful of butter into a saucepan, 
and put the saucepan on the stove. 

When the butter is melted add 1 tablespoonful 
of flour. 

Stir every minute, for it burns easily. 

When the butter and flour are frothy and well 
mixed, pour in 1 cup of milk or cream, drop by 
drop, stirring with the other hand. 

Do this quickly, but be very careful not to let 
any lumps form; the stirring is to prevent this, 
and also to keep the sauce from burning. 

Cook it till it boils up, and then stir in 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt and *4 teaspoonful of pepper. 

The sauce is now ready for use. 

This is enough for a dish for three people. It 
can be used with warmed-over meats, fish, toast, 
or sliced hard-boiled eggs.

SCRAMBLED EGGS FOB THEEE 

5 eggs Egg beater 

1 cup milk Saucepan or chafing- 

1 tablespoonful but- dish 

ter Teaspoon 

1 teaspoonful salt Tablespoons 
% teaspoonful pep- 
per 

Break 5 eggs into a bowl, being careful not to 
drop in any shells. 

Add 1 teaspoonful of salt and % of pepper. 

Beat for a minute with an egg-beater. 

Add 1 cup of milk and beat a little longer. 

Have a saucepan (you can also use a chafing- 
dish) on a hot part of the stove; put into it 1 
tablespoonful of butter and let it melt. 

Pour in the mixture and stir slowly. 

Pretty soon the egg will begin to stick to the 
bottom of the pan; keep scraping it off as you 
stir. 

When most of the mixture is thick and lumpy, 
the scramble is done. 

Do not let it get hard. 

Serve right away on hot plates; it is very nice 
to have some hot slices of toast ready and pour 
the mixture over them.

APPLE SAUCE 


Apples 


Saucepan 


Sugar 


Sharp knife 


Butter 


Apple-corer 


Spices 


Strainer or sieve 




Bowl 



Choose some nice hard cooking apples, core 
them, and peel them with a sharp knife. 

Cut them in quarters and lay these in a deep 
saucepan. 

Sprinkle the apples with granulated sugar, al- 
lowing 1 cup for 6 good-sized apples, and add to 
this 2 tablespoonf uls of mixed spices, cloves, cin- 
namon, ginger, and so forth. If you do not like 
spices you need not put this in. 

Pour into the saucepan 1 cup of cold water, 
and set the pan on a warm part of the stove. 

The apples should cook for about fifteen min- 
utes, until they are quite soft and the water is 
partly boiled away, leaving a syrup. 

Take a coarse sieve or strainer, put 1 table- 
spoonful of butter in the bottom of it, and strain 
the applesauce into a bowl. 

Push it through the strainer with a spoon if 
necessary. 

Set the bowl in a cool place, and serve the 
apple sauce cold with milk or cream.

BEADY RULE 

This rule above all others heed: — 
Have ready everything you need. 

Before you start be sure to read 

The whole receipt, then work with speed. 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 11 

STEWED FRUITS 

When stewing fruits, do not let them boil hard. 
They should only simmer. 

Cover the fruit with cold water and add sugar 
if the fruit is sour. 

The saucepan should be put at the back of the 
stove and the fruit cooked until tender. This 
often takes from 2 to 3 hours. 

Never use tin pans to cook fruit. 




12 WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 

STEWED PKUHES 
1 pound prunes Saucepan 

Put your prunes into an agate saucepan, and 
cover them with cold water, allowing 1 quart of 
water to each pound of prunes. 

Put the pan at the back of the stove. 

Cook until the prunes are tender, which will 
take about 2y 2 hours. 

Try them with a fork to see if they are soft, 
and when done turn into a bowl to cool. 

This is enough for 6 people. 

They are good served with a little cream. 

Dried fruits are cooked like primes. A little 
sugar may be added to the water if you like it 
better.

STEWED BHUBABB 

Rhubarb Measuring cup 

1 cup sugar Saucepan 

Knife 

Select tender stalks of rhubarb. 

Cut off the green tops with a sharp knife and 
throw them away. 

Cut the stalks into pieces about 1 inch long. 

When you have cut enough to fill a quart meas- 
ure put the pieces in a double boiler and barely 
cover them with cold water. 

Set the pot at the back of the stove to simmer 
for several hours. 

When you think the rhubarb is tender, try it 
with a fork. 

Add 1 cup of granulated sugar to each quart 
of rhubarb. 

Put the pot on a hot part of the stove and let 
the mixture boil hard for two minutes. 

Pour into a dish to cool. 

This is enough for 6 people. 

Peaches, apricots, oranges, pears, apples, ber- 
ries, and so forth can all be stewed in the same 
way. Berries will not take so long to cook. 
Large fruits should be peeled.

Boiling water 

1 teaspoonf ul vanilla 

Measure 2 tablespoonfuls of cocoa and put 
them in a cup with 3 tablespoonfuls of boiling 
water.

Put 2 cupfuls of granulated sugar into a 
saucepan with 1 cupful of hot water. 

Stand the saucepan on a hot part of the stove 
and let the water come to a boil. Do not stir it. 

The syrup should boil until it becomes brittle : 
that is until a little dropped in cold water imme- 
diately hardens and will break. 

Add the cocoa and let the mixture boil until it 
is quite thick. 

Take the pan from tl;e stove, stir in 1 tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, and serve hot.

to wipe the berries than wash them, but some- 
times they have to be washed. 

Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice into 
a cup with a lemon-squeezer. 

Measure 1 tablespoonful of the juice and put 
in the top pan of a double boiler or chafing-dish. 

Add to this 1 cup of granulated sugar, and 2 
cups of cold water. 

Put the pan on a hot part of the stove. 

Measure 3 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, and 
put it in a cup half full of cold water. 

Stir until the cornstarch is dissolved. 

When the sugar-water has come to a hard boil, 
add the dissolved cornstarch gradually. 

Stir until the mixture is thick and smooth.

Now set the pan onto the lower part of your 
chafing-dish or double boiler containing boiling 
water. 

Put the berries into the cornstarch mixture, 
stir them in well and put your double boiler on a 
hot part of the stove. 

The mixture should cook for 10 minutes. 

When done, turn the pudding out into a jelly 
mold and put aside to cool. 

Serve cold with milk or cream. 

This is enough for 6 people. 

When a dessert or jelly is to be served cold and 
turned out of a mold, the mold should be washed 
with very cold water before the mixture is 
poured in.

Some day when there is cooked oatmeal, or

Take the cold cereal in your hands and mould 
it into little cakes about the size of fish-balls. 

Put a piece of butter as big as a sugar-lump 
into the hot saucepan, and as soon as it is all 
melted, lay the little cakes into the pan. 

At the end of one minute lift up one of the 
cakes with your turning knife and if the under- 
side has a brown crust on it, turn the cake over. 

Do the same with each cake, until all are nicely 
browned on both sides. They should be eaten 
right away, with sugar or maple syrup on them.

Sift your flour mixture into the bowl with the 
egg yolks, and stir them together with a wooden 
spoon. 

Measure 1 cupful of milk, and add this to the 
flour and egg ; stir it in a little at a time and beat 
the mixture well with the wooden spoon. 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 25 

There must be no lumps in the batter. 

Last of all mix in your beaten egg whites care- 
fully with a fork. 

Put about Y2 a teaspoonful of butter into your 
hot pan, leaving it on the stove. 

When the butter is melted pour into the pan 
1 tablespoonful of the batter. 

Spread this out quickly so that the batter in 
the pan will be very thin, and let the cake cook 
until it is brown on the under side. 

The hotter your pan, the quicker the batter 
will cook, and the better your pancake will be. 

You can lift up a corner to see if it is done, if 
you do this carefully with a spatula. 

When the cake is done on one side, turn it 
quickly and carefully with the spatula, and 
brown on the other side. 

Never turn a cake more than once. It spoils it. 

When both sides of the cake are done, lift it 
out of your pan and put it on a hot plate. 

Make the rest of the cakes in the same way, 
as rapidly as possible, and serve at once with 
sugar and butter, or with maple sugar or maple 
syrup, or with cream. 

You may have to add a little butter to your 
pan if you find it is getting dry.

BAKING RULE 

When you bake a small thing, have the oven hot, 
But for baking big things, cool it off a lot. 

In a too-hot oven put a pan of water, —

usually takes 3 hours. If the water dries off, 
add a little more. 

They are done when soft. Serve with cream

an egg-beater until it is very stiff. 

Have ready some little bowl or deep saucer 
that is pretty enough to put on the table, and yet 
will not break in the oven. 

Into this dish pour the stiff-beaten white, and 
make a little hole in the middle of the white 
with a spoon. 

In this little hollow place put the yolk, still 
unbroken. 

Set the dish in a hot oven and cook for two or 
three minutes, or until the white is a little brown 
and the yolk is firm.

water run over it. 

Put the washed rice into a bowl, and add 4

Grate over the top some nutmeg, and set the 
Idish in a moderate oven. 

Cook for about 2 hours. From time to time as 
the pudding begins to get brown on top, stir 
down the top crust. Do this twice. When the 
rice is thoroughly soft it is done. 

Eice pudding is better served quite cold.

WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 63 

SCHOOL SANDWICHES 

To make good sandwiches it is necessary to 
have bread that is at least a day old, a sharp 
knife, and soft butter. Soften your butter by 
putting it in a dish at the back of the stove for a 
few minutes. 

Butter your loaf of bread before cutting off 
each slice and cut the slices thin. Lay the but- 
tered slices neatly together and trim off the 
crusts. Various fillings can be used ; any kind of 
cold meat, chopped up fine, cheese, jam, jelly, or 
slices of hard boiled egg. 

You can make a most delicious sandwich out of 
thin slices of brown bread, with a filling of the 
cottage cheese on page 67. Cottage cheese mixed 
with a little jam is a delicious filling for white 
bread sandwiches. 

A slice of plain cake and a slice of buttered 
bread together make a very good combination.

Choose a nice head of lettuce, one that has no 
faded leaves and that seems solid. 

Carefully pull the leaves from the stem, so that 
the tender white ends will come off too. 

Cut off the flat white root if it is headed let-

Throw away any tough or faded leaves and put 
the tender fresh leaves into a dish pan filled with 
cold water. 

Leave the lettuce in this for half an hour or 
more, then take it out, and shake off the water 
carefully. Sometimes you may need to use a 
cloth to dry the leaves. 

Take an orange, slice it with a sharp knife and 
cut off the skin. Try not to lose any juice. 

Put the lettuce leaves into a dish, lay the 
orange slices on them, and sprinkle the whole 
with y 2 a cup of granulated sugar. 

Put the bowl in the ice closet for a short time,

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Pint or more of sour. Glass milk bottle or 

milk pitcher 

Salt Mixing bowl 

Tablespoonful fresh Half -yard of white 

milk cheese-cloth 

If your mother will let you have some sour 
milk or cream, it is very easy to make cottage 
cheese. 

Put the sour milk into a glass milk bottle, or 
pitcher, and let it stand in a warm room, until it 
begins to curd; that is, until the thick part is 
very thick and lumpy, and there is a little thin 
liquid at the bottom. 

This may take twelve hours, or it may take as 
much as two days. 

Then stand the bottle at the back of the stove, 
to heat slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
until the thick part and the liquid are entirely 
separate. 

Now take a piece of white cheese-cloth, as big 
as a table napkin, lay this over a bowl, and pour 
the whole mixture into the cloth. 

Gather up the corners of the cheese-cloth and 
tie them together, making a sort of loose bag. 
Let this hang suspended over the bowl for 



68 



WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 



twenty-four hours, thus allowing the thin liquid 
to drip away, and the cheese to dry. 

The water in the bowl can be thrown away, or 
given to the dog. It is good for him. 

Take the firm ball of cheese out of its bag, put 
it in a dish, and just before you want to serve it, 
soften it by mixing into it a tablespoonful of 
fresh milk into which you have put a pinch of 
salt 

This ought to be nicer cheese than you can buy 
at any store, and is very good eaten with jam and 
bread-and-butter.

First make your toast ; this is best done over a 
hot fire, with a toaster, but you can make quite 
good toast in the oven. 

Cut enough thin slices of bread for your 
guests, allowing about two a piece. Stale bread 
is better than fresh. 

Lay these slices on a toaster, if you have one, 
or hold them one at a time on a long fork. 

Take off one of the stove covers and toast your 
bread over a hot fire until one side is brown, and 
then toast it on the other side. 

Be sure not to burn it 

If you use the oven, lay the bread in a pan. 

If the fire is not hot the toast will be tough and 
hard. This is generally the trouble when toast 
is made in the oven, or when it is made before 
you want to use it. 

Butter your toast evenly, and lay it in a hot 
dish. 

Sprinkle a pinch of salt and one of pepper 
over each piece.

Tea itself should not be boiled ; 
Boil your cocoa or it's spoiled! 




WHEN MOTHER LETS US COOK 81 

WAYS TO MAKE GOOD TEA 

In order to make good tea you must use water 
that is really boiling hard. 

First heat your tea-pot by pouring some hot 
water into it. 

Empty it and put in your tea, 1 teaspoonful 
for each cup. 

If you want to make four cups of tea, pour 1 
cup of boiling water into the pot onto your tea 
and let it stand for 3 minutes. Then add the 
other 3 cups of boiling water and let it stand for 
1 minute. 

Serve at once with sugar and cream, or sugar 
and slices of lemon. 

Never let tea stand on the tea grounds. If you 
are not ready to drink the tea when it is done, 
pour it into another pot or pitcher through a 
strainer. 

You can make very good tea by using a tea- 
ball. Put your tea into the tea-ball and put the 
tea-ball into the individual cups; pour the boil- 
ing water over and when the tea is strong enough 
remove the tea-ball. This has the advantage of 
never letting the tea stand on the leaves or 
grounds. 

If you want to make a great quantity of tea, 



82 when mother lets us cook 

for a reception or party, a very good thing to do 
is to make a number of little cheese-cloth bags 
and fill them with tea. These can be put into 
your tea-pot and when the tea is strong enough 
can be removed, in that way keeping the tea 
fresh during a long period of time. 

It is also possible to make a very thick tea 
syrup, by pouring a small quantity of boiling 
water over a large quantity of tea, and after it 
has stood for 3 minutes pouring it off into a 
tea-pot. This will keep for a day and can be 
diluted with hot water whenever a cup of tea is 
wanted. Put a small quantity in the cup, and 
pour as much hot water over it as is needed. 
This water does not need to be boiling, only 
hot, as the tea itself was made with boiling 
water.

POPPITY CORN 

Ears of popcorn Deep saucepan with 

A little oil or butter cover

Ordinary popcorn is made with a corn-popper. 
Poppity Corn is made in a deep covered dish on 
the stove, and is much fluffier and lighter. 

The most important thing is to have fresh pop- 
corn. Old corn is hard and small after it is 
popped. It is always best to get popcorn on the 
ear and shell it yourself. 

Take the deep saucepan and put two or three 
tablespoonf uls of salad oil, or butter or lard in it, 
and % teaspoonful of salt. The bottom should 
be barely covered. 

Put the dish on a hot part of the stove, and 
when the oil is very hot indeed throw in a hand- 
ful of popcorn, and put the cover on. 

While the corn is popping you may shake the 
dish a little, but it does not need to be shaken 
hard. When the corn is all popped the oil will 
be gone, and you can empty the corn onto a plate. 

A bowl of popcorn and milk is very good. 

A bowl of popcorn with a little melted butter 
stirred into it is a dish that many people like.

up pieces of popcorn, one by one, and dip them

Set the pan on the stove again and let the 
water and sugar cook until the water has nearly

EAINT-DAT FUDGE 

2 cups granulated Measuring cup 

sugar Chafing-dish or 

1 cup milk saucepan 

Butter Knife 

Teaspoonful vanilla Stirring spoon 

% pound chocolate, Teaspoon 

or 4 heaping Glass of cold water 

tablespoons cocoa Greased paper or pan 

Measure 2 cups of granulated sugar and put it 
in a saucepan with 1 cup of milk. Add a lump 
of butter about the size of a lump of sugar. 

Put the pan on a hot part of the stove, and 
while the milk is heating, cut up ^4 pouid of 
chocolate into little pieces. 

If you use cocoa, put 4 heaping tablespoonf uls 
right in with the milk, without waiting. Choco- 
late and cocoa must both be unsweetened. 

When the milk and sugar in the pan begin to 
get smoking hot, add your chocolate. 

Cook for 15 or 20 minutes, stirring all the 
time. 

Be sure that the pan is on a hot part of the 
stove and that you stir it well so that it will not 
burn.

a little out with a teaspoon and drop it in a glass 
of cold water. If it gets thick and stiff, you may 
be sure the rest is done. 

Take the pan off the stove, add 1 teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract and beat it together with a 
spoon for three minutes. 

Take your greased paper and lay it on a plate, 
or better still, take the baking tin which you have 
smeared with butter, and pour over it the hot 
fudge. 

Leave the fudge in a cold place to harden. 

When it is perfectly firm, cut it into squares 
with a sharp knife. 

It should be about ^ an inch thick, so do not 
try to fill too large a pan. 

It is not always necessary to cook fudge for 20 
minutes, so it is just as well to try it after 10 or 
15 minutes. 

This receipt makes nearly a pound of candy.

MOLASSES CANDY 

1 cupful molasses Measuring cup 

1 cupful brown sugar Tablespoon 

1 tablespoonful vin- Saucepan 
egar Pans 

2 tablespoonf uls Glass or cup 
butter 

Take a large saucepan and put into it 1 cupful 
of molasses, 1 cupful of brown sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter. 

Set the saucepan on a hot part of the stove and 
when the mixture boils, look at the clock and let 
it boil for about 15 minutes. 

Test a spoonful of it in a glass of cold water. 
If the mixture becomes hard and breakable at 
once, it is done. It should be much harder than 
the peppermint syrup. 

Bub a shallow baking tin with butter and into 
this pour the mixture at once. 

Put the pan in a cool place. 

As soon as the mixture is cold enough to touch 
without burning your fingers, spoon out pieces 
as big as your fist and have each person take one 
of the pieces. 

Pull it apart with your two hands and twist it,

and pull it, until it gets a nice light yellow and is 
so stiff that you can't pull it any more. 

Twist it into long thin ropes and let them get 
entirely hard on buttered plates in the ice chest. 
Then break into short pieces for eating. 

This makes enough for four children to pull. 

It is very important to have your hands clean 
before you begin pulling the candy.

PEFFEBHINT DBOPS FOB TWO CHHDBEN TO MAKE 

2 cupfuls sugar Measuring cup 

1 cupful water Saucepan 

1 teaspoonf ul extract Teaspoon 
of peppermint Two thick glasses 

Brown paper 

Measure 2 cupf uls of granulated sugar and 
put it in a saucepan. 

Add 1 cupful of cold water, and set the pan on 
a hot part of the stove. 

When it comes to a boil, look at the clock and 
boil for about 20 minutes, stirring from time to 
time. 

When you think it's done, try a little, by drop- 
ping half a teaspoonful into a glass of cold 
water. 

If it is done it will get stringy and hard in the 
water. 

When you are sure that it is ready, take the 
pan from the stove, and pour the syrup into two 
glasses. 

Pour Y2 teaspoonful of peppermint extract at 
once into each glass and let each child stir the 
mixture in his glass rapidly with a teaspoon until 
the syrup gets thick and creamy white. 

Have a large flat sheet of brown wrapping

paper ready on your kitchen table and onto this 
drop little round dabs of the mixture as rapidly 
as possible. 

Don't let the mixture get too cool and stiff by 
stirring it longer than necessary. 

When entirely hard and cold, the peppermints 
can be lifted off with a knife. 

This makes about half a pound.
