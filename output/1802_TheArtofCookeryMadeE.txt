PREFACE. 



1 HE mode of cookery which the author 
of the following sheets has pursued for a 
scries of years having obtained the most 
distinguished approbation of the public, 
has induced him to commit his practice 
to paper; in doing which, a deviation 
has been made from the usual intro- 
ductory methods of .other treatises of 
the kind, in omitting to give particular 
directions for the choice of fish, meats, 
poultry, and vegetables, and at what 
times they respectively might be in sear 
son, &c. &c. the author conceiving the 
simpler method to be the most accep-

table : and^ therefore^ as actual know- 
ledge must ever supersede written forms, 
he would advise a frequent attendance at 
the different markets, fully assured that 
experience will convey greater instruction 
in marketing than all the theories which 
could be advanced. There are, never- 
theless, some useful observations inter- 
spersed in the course of the work for 
that purpose, the author having confined 
himself chiefly to the practical part of 
cookery ; he has also given some direc- 
tions in a branch of the confectiohafy 
business : in both of which it has beeii 
his constant endeavour tliat they rnight 
be rendered as simple and easy as pos- 
sible, and that economy might pervade 
the whole. 



The receipts arc written for the least 
possible quantities in the different madfe-

dishes and . sauces^ it being a frequent 
error in most of the books that they are 
too expensive and too long ; by which 
means the art has been rendered intri- 
cate in the extreme, both in theory i^nd 
practice. 

Independent, als.o> of a close adherence 
to apy given rules, there are other cjua- 
lities essential to the completion pf a 
thorough cook ; such as, an wv^c taste, 
a fertile invention, and a rigid attention 
to cleanliness. 



The preceding hints and subsequent 
directions, it is hoped, will prove fully 
adequate to perfection in cookery; the 
work being entirely divested of the 
many useless receipts from other pro- 
fessions, (which have been uniformly 
introduced in books of the like nature,)

: of no colour; then add a sufficient 
mtity of beef stock to cover the ingre- 
nts> boil all together one hour, skim 
free from fat, and strain it. Some 
ne drawn down with it will make it 
;ellent. 

N. B. I have directed the veal stock 
t to be drawn down to a colour, as in 
It state it will answer two purposes; 
tt, for wftite soups ; and, secondly, as 
might be coloured with a bright liquid 
any height, which will be directed for 
ivy soups. It frequently happens, like- 
se, that, if not strictly attended to, it 
11 bum. 

Cojtsum^, or the Essence of Meat. 

Reduce veal stock to a good consist- 
ice, but be careful not to let it colour. 

*■■

a quart of water, and draw them down 
till of a light brown colour, but be care- 
ful not to let it burn ; then discharge it 
with beef stock. When it boils, skim it 
very clean from fat, and thicken it with 
flour and water, or flour and butter pass- 
cd. Let it boil gently three quartets of 
an hour ; season it to the palate with ' 
cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt; 
strain it through a tamls cloth or sieve, 
and add a little liquid of colour, which 
may be made as in the following receipt. 

Liquid of Colour for Sauces, &c. 

Put a quarter of a pound of the best 
brown sugar into a frying pan very clean 
from grease, and half a gill of water; set it 
over a gentle fire, stirring it with a wood- 
en spoon till it is thoroughly burnt and 
of a good bright colour, then discharge 
it with water; when it boils skim it and

water, or flour and butter passed ; add to 
it a sufficient quantity of cream to make 
it quite white. Let it simmer gently half 
an hour, and strain it through a tamis 
cloth.

SoMp a la Reine. 

Take three quarts of veal stock with 
a blade of mace boiled in it; then strain 
it to the crumb of four penny fr^nch

pounded. Let all simmer together for 
ten minutes, and rub them through a

thickness; season it to the palate with 
salt; make it boil, and serve it up with 
a gill of cream in it.

over a fire, let it boil gently ten minuter, 
then strain it through a tamis cloth. This 
stock, is required for rice, brown vermi- 
celli^ celery, . sante, or turnip soups* 

"N. B. I have directed the brown stock, 
for gravy soups only, to be cleared with ' 
eggs, a3 that method has been most ap- 
proved, it being pleasant to the eye, and 
equally agreeable to the palate.

toasted bread on a plate. 



Real Turtle. 

Hang the turtle up by the hind fins, 
and cut off the head overnight; in the 
morning cut off the fore fins at the joints, 
and the calHpee all round; then take out 
the entrails, and be careful not to break 
the gall; after which cut off the hind 
fins and all the meat from the bones, 
callipee and callipash; then chop the cal- 
lipee and callipash into pieces; scald them 
together, the fins being whole, but take 
care not to let the scales set. When 
cleaned, chop the fins into pieces four 
inches long; wash the pieces of the cal- 



17 

lipee^ caUipash, and fins, and put them 
into a pot with the bones and a sufficient 
quantity of water to cover; then add a 
bunch of sweet herbs and whole onions, 
and skim it when the liquor boils. When 
the £ns are* nearly done take them out, 
together with the remainder of the tur- 
tle, when done, picked free from bone. 
Then strain the liquor and boil it down 
till reduced to one third part ; after which 
cut the meat into pieces four times larger 
than dice; put it into a pot, add a mix- 
ture of herbs chopped fine,* such as knot- 
ted marjoram, savory, thyme, parsley, a 
very little , basil, some' chopped onions, 
some beaten spices, as allspice, a few 
cloves, a little mace, black pepper, salt, 
some veal stock, and the liquor that was 
reduced. Boil the meat till three parts 
done, pick it free from herbs, strain the 
liquor through a tamis sieve, make a pass- 
ing of flour and three quarters of a pound 
of fresh butter, mixing it well over a fire 
for some time, and then add to it madeira 
wine, (if a turtle of seventy pounds weight, 

C 



i8 
tfarte pints,) and the liquor of the meat. 
When it boils, skim it clean, season to 
the paiate with cayenne pepper, lemon' 
juice, and salt, and strain it to the pieces 
6f fins and shell in one pot, and the lean 
meat into another; and if the turtle pro- 
duce any real green fat, let it be boiled 
till done, then strained, cut into pieces, 
and added to the fins and shell, and then 
simmer each meat till tender. When it 
is to be served up, put a little fat at the 
bottom of the tureens, some lean in the 
center, and more fat at the top, with 
e^ and force-meat balls, and a few 
entrails. 

N. B. The entrails must be cleaned 
well, then boiled in water till very tender, 
and preserved as white as possible, and just 
before they are strained off add the balls. 
If a calHpash is served up, the shell to be 
Cut down on each side, and chop the 
pieces for the soup; the remaining part 
of the back shell to be pasted round with 
a raised crust, egged, ornamented, and 



'9 
baked^ and the soup served in it in th« 
same manner as in the tureens. 



Calltpee. 

Take a quarter of the under part of a 
turtle of sixty pounds weight, and scald 
it, and when done, take the shoulder-bone 
out and fill the cavity with a good high*^ 
seasoned forcemeat made with the lean 
of the turtle; put it into a stewpan, and 
add a pint of madeira wine, cayenne pep- 
per, salt, lemon juice, a clove of garlicki 
a little mace, a few cloves and allspice 
tied in a bag, a bunch of sweet herbs, some 
whole onions, and three quarts of good 
beef stock. Stew gently till three parts 
done ; then take the turtle and put it into 
another stewpan, with some of the en- 
trails boiled and some eg^ balls; add a 
little thickening of flour and • butter 

to the liquor, let it boil, and strain it 
to the turtle, &c. then stew it till ten- 
der, and the liquor almost reduced to a 
glail^. Serve it up in ft deep dish, 

C z 



20 

pasted round as a callipash, ornamented 
and baked. 

N. B. I think the above mode of serv- 
ing it up in a dish the best, as it fre- 
quently happens that the sliell of the cal- 
lipee is not properly baked. 

Glaize for HamSy Larding, roa/ied Poul- 
try y &c. 

Take a leg of veal, lean of ham, beef, 
some indifferent fowls, celery, turnips, 
carrots, onions, leeks cleaned and cut 
into pieces, a little lemon peel, mace, 
and black pepfer, a small quantity of 
each; add three quarts of water, sweat 
them down till three parts donev dis- 
charge with water, and boil it till the 
goodness is extracted; then skim it, and 
strain the liquor into a large pan. Next 
day take the fat from it very clean; set 
the stock over a fire, and when warm 
clear it with whites and a few yolks of 
eggs; then add a little colour and straiti 



it through a tamis ; boil it quick till re- 
duced to a glaize^ and be careful not to 
let it burn. 

N. B. In the same manner may be 
made glaive of separate herbs or roots, 
which will be serviceable on board a ship; 
or in the country, where herbs or roots 
cannot be procured at all times; and they 
are to be preserved in bottles, as they 
will not, when cold, be of a portable 
substance. 



Fish plain boiled to be prepared thus : 

Put them in clean boiling pump water 
well salted, and when served up to be 
garnished with fresh picked parsley and 
scraped horseradish; except salt fish, which 
should be properly soaked, then cut in 
pieces and put in cold water, and when 
it boils let it simmer six or eight minutes, 
and serve it up on a napkin with boiled 
parsnips and potatoes round, or on a plate, 
and egg sauce in a boat. 

C3 



2Z 



N. B* Fish should be chosen very fresh 
and of good appearance, it adding as much 
to their beauty as gratifying to the pa- 
late when dressed, there being in my 
opinion but two sorts — good and bad. 
3ut as an exception to the above obser- 
vation, skate will be better for eating if 
kept for one or two days in a cool place 
before it is dressed. 



Fish generally fried. 

Pieces of jskate. 
iWhitings. 
Fillets of haddocks. 
Smelts. 
Soles. 
Perch. 

Flounders. 
Slices of hollibut. 
Slices of cod.

gently over a clear coal fire till of a fine 
colour, and serve them up directly. 

N. B. Fish in general to be floured, 
except herrings, which are only to be 
scored with a knife, and the following 
methods of broiling other fish to be ob- 
served. 



Broiled Salmon to he prepared thus:

Take pieces or slices of salmon, wipe 
them dry, dip them in sweet oil, and 
season with pepper and salt; fold them 
in pieces of writing paper, broil over a 
clear fire, and serve them up very hot. '-• 

N. B. In the same manner are to be 
done red mullets, &c. 



^s 



Broiled Mackarel, common wiry. 

Wipe them dry, split them down the 
back, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and 
broil them gently* 

To stew Fish. 

Add to some cuUis a few chopped 
eshallots, anchovies, a bay leaf, horsera- 
dish scraped, a little quantity of lemon 
peel, and some red port; season it well 
with cayenne pepper, salt, and juice of 
lemon, and when it boils let it be of a 
proper thickness, and strain it to the fish; 
then stew it gently, and serve it up in a 
c^ep dish with the liquor, and fried bread 
round it. If carp or tench, some of the 
hard roe mixed in battei^and fried in 
pieces. The roes likewise of different 
fish may be stewed in the same manner, 
and served up as, a dish of themselves. 
E^ls, soles, or other fish may be done 
the same way.

deep dish, strew parsley roots and scalded 

parsley over, and add some of the liquor. 
Serve them up as hot as possible, with 

slices of brown bread. and butter on a 

plate* 

N. B. The time the fish are to boil 
must be according to their size ; and the 
parsley roots are to be cleaned, cut into 
slips, and boiled by themselves till ten- 
der. 

Roqfied Pike or Sturgeon. 

Let the fish be well cleaned, then 
make a stuffing of capers, anchovies, 

7 






i7 

parsley and thyme chopped fine, a little 
grated nutmeg and lemon peel, pepper, 
salt, breadcrumbs, fresh butter, and an 
egg. Fill the fish and sew it up; turn 
it round, and fasten the head with the 
tail ; then egg the fish over and bread* 
crumb it; after which bake or roast it 
gently till done, and of a good brown

celery, turnips, onions, leeks, garlick, 
parsley, and thyme, tied in a bunch; 
allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper,

that was strained. When the different 
things are braised enough, pour the 
Hquors from them into a pan, leaving a 
little with each to preserve from burn- 
ing. When they are to , be served up, 
skim the liquor very clean^ and clear

seasoned to the palate with cayenne pep- 
per and letnon juice. 

[This receipt for a Spanish olio is only 
written to shew how expensive a dish 
may be made, and which. I saw done. 
As a substitute I have introduced the 
folloviring english one, which has been 
generally approved; and I think, with 
particular attention, it will ' exceed the 
former in flavour.]

Directions Jbr roasting. 

Observe that in roasting it requires 
a good quick fire, but not too strong, 
and the meats should be well-jointed, 
trimmed neat, and covered with paper 
to preserve it frota being too high a co- 
lour. Beef and mutton should not be 
done too much; veal, pork, and lamb, 
should be done well ; and some little time 



85 

before it is to be served up, take the 
paper off, sprinkle the meat with salt^ 
and when of a proper colour, froth it 
"with butter and flour.. Large poultry to 
be papered and done in the same man- 
gier ; but small poultry, such as chickens, 
Woodcocks, rabbits, wild fowls, &c. will 
not require papering. The time the se- 
veral articles will take roasting depends 
upon a little practice, as the weather and 
the different strength^ of fires make a 
material alteratioQ. I have given direc- 
tions for some particular roasts which 
require a preparation ; as for others 
which are served with sauces, they may 
be found ^nder their respective heads: 
and for the trimmings of meat, &c. I 
have wrote a receipt to make into soup, 
or they may be put into the beef stocls; 
pot.

till the peas are tender, add a little dry 
mint, and rub it through a tamis cloth 
or sieve. Then season the meat with 
pepper and salt, sweated down till three 
parts tender, and add the pulp. Boil all 
together till the meat is done, skim it and 
servd it up with fried bread in the form

Observations on Meat and Poultry. 

Meats to be preferred when of a 
good fatness and the lean appears juicy, 
but not particularly streaked with fat, as 
it then frequently happens to eat hard. 
When the season will permit let it hang 
for a week, and not more, as I have found 
that period bring it to its best state.* 
Poultry, likewise, should be chosen to- 
lerably fat and of a soft grain. Let them 
hang three or four days, which will add 
to their better eating ; except woodcocks, 
snipes, larks, or pigs, which should be

manner ; but instead of the tongue put 
in whole green truffles pared, and some 
truffles pounded with the forcemeat, and 
when served up, add a good cuUis. Or, 
instead of a raised crust, they may be 
put in a dish and covered with puff 
paste, &c. 

Raised Macaroni Pie. 

Kaise a crust and ornament and bake 
it, and when it is to be served up have

apjpearance when baked; but there is 

another mode which may be thought 

preferable; and which is, to mix together

Directions for Poultry, &c. plain boiled. 

Let it be observed that turkics, chick- 
ens, and meats, intended to be plai^ boil- 



L 



12^ 

cd, should be soaked in cold water, and 
put after wards into plenty of boiling pump 
water, kept skimmed and preserved as 
white as possible. The time jthey will 
take dressing depends on a little practice, 
as in roastipg. Be particular in trim- 
ming the meats neat, and in trussing the . 
poultry. The carving, likewise, should 
be carefully attended to, which is fre- 
quently expressed by the phrase of cutting 
into pieces. 

Jugged Hare.

per, a little of each ; a small clove of gar- 
lick, three onions, two bay leaves, parsley, 
thyme, and savory, tied together in a 
small bunch ; a quart of veal stock, three 
gills of red port; and simmer them over 
a fire, till three parts done. Then take 



fK 



123 

out the shoulders, legs, and back ; put 
them into another stewpan, strain the

sauce round it, which is to be made with 
turnips cut into shapes as for haricot ; 
afterwards to be put into a stewpan and 
sweated with a bit of fresh butter till 
three parts done ; then add a good cuUis 
arid the essence in which the duck was 
braised. When it boils, skim free from 
fat, seiason to the palate, and stew the 
turnips till done.

nutes more. Let it stand till cold, and

inixture boil, and skim it clean. 

Observatiofis in respect of Fish Sauces, &c. 

Let it be particularly observed that 
^sh sauces should be of the thickness of 



t66 

light battef , so that it - might Mher^ to 
the fish when dressed, it bcipg a frequent 
error that they are either too thick or top 
thin. The thickening should be made 
with the best white flovir sifted, and some 
water, mixed smooth with a wooden 
spoon or a whisk, and to be of the con- 
sistence of light batter also. A little q£ 
it is recommended to be always ready 
where there is much cooking, as it is fre- 
quently wanted both in fish and other 
sauces. 

There are, likewise, other articles re- 
peatedly wanted for the use of stove- 
work ; and as their possession has 
been found to obviate much incon- 
venience and trouble, they are here 
enumerated : that is to say, liquid of co- 
lour preserved in a bottle, strained lemon 
juice preserved in the same manner, 
cayenne pepper, ground spices, ground 
pepper and salt mixed, which should be 
preserved separately in small jars ; and 
every day, when wanted, fresh bread- 
crunlbs rubbed through a hair sieve; 



A6y 

parsley, thymes, eschallots, savoy, mar- 
joram, and lemon peel, chopped very 
fine, and put on a dish in separate 
partitions. 

Directions are not given for serving 
the fish sauces with any particular kind 
offish,— such as turbot or salmon with 
lobster sauce, &c. but the receipts have 
been written only for the making them ; 
therefore it is recommended that every 
person make a choice, and not be biassed 
altogether by custom. 



jipple Sauce for Pork, Geese, &c. 

Pare, quarter, and core, baking apples; 
put them into a stewpan, add a bit of 
lemon rind, a small stick of cinnamon, a

water. Cover the pan close, set it over 
a moderate fire, and when the apples are 
tender take the peel and spice; out ; then 
add a bit of fresh butter, and sugar to the 
palate. i

sugar, the yolk of a raw egg, and a 
spoonful of vinegar ; if spinach juice, 
then put one ounce of fresh butter, and 
whisk all together over a fire till it begin$ 
to boih

Pick, green fennel, mint, and parsley, 
a little of each; wash, boil them till

fine, add melted butter, and serve up the 
sauce immediately, for should the herbs 






i 



i6g 

be mixed with the butter any length of 
time before it is served up, they will 
be discoloured. The same observation 
should be noticed in making parsley and 
butter sauce. 



Bread Sauce, Jor Turktes, Game, &c. 

Soak a piece of crumb of bread with 
half a pint of milk or cream, add a 
peeled middling-sized onion, and put

sorbed bruise the bread, mix with it 
two ounces of fresh butter, a little white 
pepper, and salt ; and when it is to be 
served up take out the onion. 



Melted Butter. 

In order to prevent butter from oiling, 

the flour and water that may be sufficient 

for the quantity of butter should be made 

boiling, skimmed clean, and the butter 

added to dissolve, being careful it is of a 

proper thickness.

To bottle Gooseberries, ^c. for Tarts. 

Gather gooseberries on a dry day 
when about h^f grown, and pick off 
the stalks and blossoms ; then put the 
fruit into wide-mouthed bottles and shake 
them down ; cork them very close, bake 
them in a modei'ate oven till thoroughly 
heated through, and set them in a dry 
cool place. 

N. B. Damsons, currants, cherries, or 
plums may be done in the same way. 

[The above mode of preserving fruits ' 

is recommended in preference to preserv- 
ing them with sugar, it frequently hap- 



I 



3^3 

pening that fruits done with syrup will 
fret^ and in that event the whole be 
spoiled.] 



To hottle Gooseberries another way. 

When the gooseberries are picked put 
them into the bottles and cover them 
with spring water ; then set them in a 
large pan of cold water, put them over 
9L moderate fire, and when the goose- 
berries appear to be scalded enough take 
out the bottles and set them in a cool 
place, and when cold cork them close. 

[This mode has been found to answer 
extremely well. The small champaign 
gooseberry is recommended likewise for 
the purpose.]

m 

Blanch two heart sweetbreads, wash 
and trim off the pipe, then boil them in 
milk and water with a little salt for half 
an hour ; drain them dry, and when they 
are to be served to table put over them 
some boiling benshamelle with a little 
parsley chopped very fine in it. 



Broiled Sweetbreads. 

Blanch the sweetbreads till half 
done, wash and trim off the pipe, then 
cut them into large slices, season with a 
small quantity of cayenne pepper and 
salt, broil them gently over a clear fire 



314 

till of a nice brown colour, and serve 
them up very hot, vsrith some cold fresh 
butter on a plate. 



Conclusion, with Remarh. 

All sweets, pastry, shellfish or savoury 
dishes, either plain or modelled, with fat 
or butter, or ornaments of any kind, that 
are served up in second courses or ball 
suppers, &c. should be very light, airy, 
and neat ; the pastry, likewise, of the 
best pulF paste, well-baked, and rather 
inclining to a pale colour, which has a 
very good effect. 

Let it also be observed, . that mention 
should have been made in the receipt 
for Mock Turtle, of an addition to the 
passing of flour and butter, to each gal- 
lon of liquor half a pint of madeira wine; 
and (if approved) the mock turtle may 
be made with pieces of cow-heel or pig*s 
head instead of calf's scalp.

PREFACE. 



X HE mode of cookery which the author 
of the following sheets has pursued for a 
series of years having obtained the most 
distinguished approbation of the public^ 
has induced him to commit his practice 
to paper ; in doing which, a deviation 
has been made from the usual intro- 
ductory methods of other treatises of 
the kind, in omitting to give particular 
directions for the choice of fish, meats, 
poultry, and vegetables, and at what 
times they respectively might be in sea- 
son, &c. &c. the author conceiving the 
simpler method to be the most accep- 



VI 



table : and, therefore, as actual know- 
ledge must ever supersede written forms, 
he would advise a frequent attendance at 
the different markets, fully assured that 
experience will convey greater instruction 
in marketing than all the theories which 
could be advanced. There are, never- 
theless, some useful observations inter- 
spersed in the course of the work for 
that purpose, the author having confined 
himself chiefly to the practical part of 
cookery : he has also r>;iven some direc- 
tions in a branch of the confectionary 
business : in both of vvhich it has been 
his constant endeavour that they might 
be rendered as simpL; and easy as pos- 
sible, and niat economy might pervade 
the whole. 

The rec; pts are written for the least 
possible quantities in the different made- 



Ml 



dishes and sauces^ it being a frequent 
error in most of the books that they are 
too expensive and too long ; by which 
means the art has been rendered intri- 
cate in the extreme, both in theory and 
practice. 

> 
Independent, also, of a close adherence 
to any given rules, there are other qua- 
lities essential to the completion of a 
thorough cook ; such as, an acute taste, 
a fertile invention, and a rigid attention 
to cleanliness. 

The preceding hints and subsequent 
directions, it is hoped, will prove fully 
adequate to perfection in cookery; the 
work being entirely divested of the 
many useless receipts from other pro- 
fessions, (which have been uniformly 
introduced in books of the like nature,) 



Vlll 



and nothing inserted but what has an 
immediate reference to the art itself. 

There is prefixed a Bill of Fare for each 
month in the year, as a specimen of the 
seasons, which may be altered as judg- 
ment directs. There is annexed, also, at 
the end of the volume, an Index, by 
which, from the first letter or word of 
the different articles, will be found their 
respective receipts.

THE 

ART OF COOKERY. 



Beef Stock. 

v-'UT chuck beef into pieces, put it into 
a pot, set it on the fire, with a sufficient 
quantity of water to cover it. When it 
boils skim it clean; add a bunch of parsley 
and thyme, cleaned carrots, leeks, onions, 
turnips, celery, and a little salt. Let 
the meat boll till tender, skim off the 
fat, then strain it through a fine hair 
sieve. 

VeaJ Stock, for Soups, 

Take a leg of veal and some lean ham, 
cut them into pieces, put them into a 
pan with a quart of water, some peeled 
carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and ce- 
lery; draw them down till nearly tender, 

B 



2 

but of no colour; then add a sufficient 
quantity of beef stock to cover the ingre- 
dients, boil all together one hour, skim 
it free from fat, and strain it. Some 
game drawn down with it will make it 
excellent. 

N. B. I have directed the veal stock 
not to be drawn down to a colour, as in 
that state it will answer two purposes; 
first, for white soups; and, secondly, as 
it might be coloured with a bright liquid 
to any height, which will be directed for 
gravy soups. It frequently happens, like- 
wise, that, if not strictly attended to, it 
will burn. 



Consume, or the Essence of Meat. 

Reduce veal stock to a good consist- 
ence, but be careful not to let it colour. 



CmWs, or a thick Gravy, 

Take slices of ham, veal, celery, car- 
rots, turnips, onions, leeks, a small bunch 



3 

of sweet herbs, some allspice, black pep- 
per, mace, a piece of lemon-peel, and 
two bay leaves; put them into a pan with 
a quart of water, and draw them down 
till of a light brown colour, but be care- 
ful not to let it burn; then discharge it 
with beef stock. When it boils, skim it 
very clean from fat, and thicken it with 
flour and water, or flour and butter pass- 
ed. Let it boil gently three quarters of 
an hour; season it to the palate wath 
cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and salt; 
strain it through a tamis cloth or sieve, 
and add a little liquid of colour, w^hich 
may be made as in the following receipt. 

Liquid of Colour for Sauces, &c. 

Put a quarter of a pound of the best 
brown sugar into a frying pan very clean 
from grease, and half a gill of water; set it 
over a 2:entle fire, stirring it with a woi5d- 
en spoon till it is thoroughly burnt and 
of a good bright colour, then discharge 
it with water; when it boils skim it an4 
B 2 



4 

strain it. Put it by for use in a vessel 
close covered. 

Befishamelle, 

Take w^hite veal, lean ham, turnips, 
celery, onions cut in pieces, a blade of 
mace, a little whole w^hite pepper; sweat 
them down till three parts tender, then 
discharge it with beef stock. Let it boil, 
skim it clean, and thicken with flour and 
water, or flour and butter passed; add to 
it a sufficient quantity of cream to make 
it quite white. L/Ct it simmer gently half 
an hour, and strain it through a tamis 
cloth. 

N. B. Let it be of the thickness of 
light batter. 

To make a passing of Flour and Butter for 
CuUis or Benshamelle, 

Put frefli butter into a stewpan over a 
fire, when it is melted add a sufficient 
quantity of sifted flour to make it into a 



5 

paste, and mix them together with a whisk 
over a very slow fire for ten minutes. 

Soup a la Reme, 

Take three quarts of veal stock with 
a blade of mace boiled in it; then strain 
it to the crumb of four penny frcnch 
rolls, three quarters of a pound of sweet 
almonds blanched and pounded very fine, 
likewise the white meat of dressed fowl 
pounded. Let all simmer together for 
ten minutes, and rub them through a 
tamis cloth till the soup is of a proper 
thickness; season it to the palate with 
salt; make it boil, and serve it up with 
a gill of cream in it.

over a fire, let it boil gently ten minutes, 
then strain it through a tamis cloth. This

celli, celery, sante, or turnip soups. 

N. B. I have directed the brown stock, 
for gravy soups only, to be cleared with 
eggs, as that method has been most ap- 
proved, it being pleasant to the eye, and 
equally agreeable to the palate.

Take a scalp cleaned by the butcher, 
scald it for twenty minutes, then wash 
it clean, cut it into pieces two inches 
square, add a gallon of veal stock, and 



15 

boil them till nearly done. Have ready 
some pieces of veal cut in form of dice,

Mutton Broth. 

Take a neck of mutton cut into pieces, 
preserving a handsome piece to be served

toasted bread on a plate. 



Real Turtle, 

Hang the turtle up by the hind fins, 
and cut off the head overnight; in the 
morning cut off the fore fins at the joints, 
and the callipee all round; then take out 
the entrails, and be careful not to break 
the gall; after which cut off the hind 
fins and all the meat from the bones, 
callipee and callipash; then chop the cal- 
lipee and callipash into pieces; scald them 
together, the fins being whole, but take 
care not to let the scales set. When 
cleaned, chop the fins into pieces four 
inches long; wash the pieces of the cal- 



17 

lipee, calllpash, and fins, and put them 
into a pot with the bones and a sufficient 
quantity of water to cover; then add a 
bunch of sweet herbs and whole onions, 
and skim it w^hen the hquor boils. When 
the fins are nearly done take them out, 
together w4th the remainder of the tur- 
tle, when done, picked free from bone. 
Then strain the liquor and boil it down 
till reduced to one third part; after which 
cut the meat into pieces four times larger 
than dice; put it into a pot, add a mix- 
ture of herbs chopped fine, such as knot- 
ted marjoram, savory, thyme, parsley, a 
very little basil, some chopped onions, 
some beaten spices, as allspice, a few 
cloves, a little mace, black pepper, salt, 
some veal stock, and the liquor that was 
reduced. Boil the meat till three parts 
done, pick it free from herbs, strain the 
liquor through a tamis sieve, make a pass- 
ing of flour and three quarters of a pound 
of fresh butter, mixing it well over a fire 
for some time, and then add to it madeira 
wine, (if a turtle of seventy pounds wxight, 

C 



i8 

three pints,) and the liquor of the meat. 
When it boils, skim it clean, season to 
the palate with cayenne pepper, lemon 
juice, and salt, and strain it to the pieces 
of fins and shell in one pot, and the lean 
meat into another; and if the turtle pro- 
duce any real green fat, let it be boiled 
till done, then strained, cut into pieces, 
and added to the fins and shell, and then 
simmer each meat till tender. When it 
is to be served up, put a little fat at the 
bottom of the tureens, some lean in the 
center, and more fat at the top, with 
egg and force-meat balls, and a few 
entrails. 

N. B. The entrails must be cleaned 
well, then boiled in water till very tender, 
and preserved as white as possible, and just 
before they are strained off add the balls. 
If a callipash is served up, the shell to be 
cut down on each side, and chop the 
pieces for the soup; the remaining part 
of the back shell to be pasted round with 
a raised crust, egged, ornamented, and 



19 

baked, and the soup served in it in tRe 
same manner as in the tureens. 

Callipee. 

Take a quarter of the under part of a 
turtle of sixty pounds weight, and scald 
it, and when done, take the shoulder-bone 
out and fill the cavity with a good high- 
seasoned forcemeat made with the lean 
of the turtle; put it into a stewpan, and 
add a pint of madeira wine, cayenne pep- 
per, salt, lemon juice, a clove of garlick,- 
a little mace, a few cloves and allspice 
tied in a bag, a bunch of sweet herbs, some 
whole onions, and three quarts of good 
beef stock. Stew gently till three parts 
done ; then take the turtle and put it into 
another stewpan, with some of the en- 
trails boiled and some egg balls; add a 
little thickening of flour and butter 
to the liquor, let it boil, and strain it 
to the turtle, &c. then stew it till ten- 
der, and the liquor almost reduced to a 
glaize. Serve it up in a deep dish, 
C z 



20 

fasted round as a callipash, ornamented 
and baked. 

N. B. I think the above mode of serv- 
ing it up in a dish the best, as it fre- 
quently happens that the shell of the cal- 
lipee is not properly baked. 



Glaize for Hams, Lardiitg, roajied Foul- 
try , ^c. 

Take a leg of veal, lean of ham, beef, 
some indifferent fowls, celery, turnips, 
carrots, onions, leeks cleaned and cut 
into pieces, a little lemon peel, mace, 
and black pepper, a small quantity of 
each; add three quarts of water, sweat 
them down tlil three parts done, dis- 
charge with water, and boil it till the 
goodness is extracted; then skim it, and 
strain the liquor into a large pan. Next 
day take the fat from it very clean; set 
the stock over a fire, and when warm 
clear it with whites and a few yolks of 
eggs; then add a little colour and strain 



it through a tamis; boil it quick till re- 
duced to a glaize, and be careful not to 
let it burn. 



N. B. In the same manner may be 
made glaize of separate herbs or roots, 
which will be serviceable on board a ship, 
or in the country, where herbs or roots 
cannot be procured at all times; and they 
are to be preserved in bottles, as they 
will not, when cold, be of a portable 
substance. 



Fhh plain boiled to be prepared thus : 

Put them in clean boiling pump w^ater 
well salted, and when served up to be 
garnished with fresh picked parsley and 
scraped horseradish; except salt fish, which 
should be properly soaked, then cut in 
pieces and put in cold water> and when 
it boils let it simmer six or eight minutes, 
and serve it up on a napkin with boiled 
parsnips and potatoes round, or on a plate, 
and egg sauce in a boat. 
C3 



22 



N. B. Fish should be chosen very fresh 
and of^ood appearance, it adding as much 
to their beauty as gratifying to the pa- 
late when dressed, there being in my 
opinion but two sorts — good and bad. 
But as an exception to the above obser- 
vation, skate w^ill be better for eating if 
kept for one or two days in a cool place 
before it is dressed. 



Fish generally fried. 

Pieces of skate. 

Whitings. 

Fillets of haddocks. 

Smelts 

Soles.

when it almost boils put a proper quantity 
and fry them of a fine gold colour; 
drain them dr^, and serve them up with 
fried parsley. 

N. B. The crumbs to be rubbed 
through a hair sieve. The parsley also 
to be picked, washed, and dried with 
a cloth, then to be put into the lard not 
very hot, and fried of a green colour.

proper thickness, and strain it to the fish; 
then stew it gently, and serve it up in a 
deep dish with the liquor, arid fried bread 
round it. If carp or tench, some of the 
hard roe mixed in batter and fried in 
pieces. The roes likewise of different 
fish may be stewed in the same manner,

The Olio to be made as follows: 

Take the beef, veal, mutton, and 
ham; cut them into pieces, put them 
into a pot, cover with water, and when 
it boils skim clean; then add carrots, 
celery, turnips, onions, leeks, garlick, 
parsley, and thyme, tied in a bunch; 
allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper, 
mace, and a little ginger, put in a cloth. 
Boil all together till it becomes a strong

that was strained. When the different 
things are braised enough, pour the 
hquors from them into a pan, leaving a 
httle with each to preserve from burn- 
ing. When they are to be served up, 
skim the hquor very clean, and clear 
it with w hires of eggs ; then cut tur-

partitions in it w4th slips of fried bread 

dipped in whites of eggs, and set it in a 

D 2 



36 

slow oven or before a fire; then lay the 
tendrons, birds, beef, mutton, fowls, &c. 
alternately in the partitions, and serve up 
with the haricot roots, &c. over. 

N. B. The whole of the liquor to be 
seasoned to the palate with cayenne pep- 
per and lemon juice. 

[This receipt for a Spanish olio is only 
written to shew how expensive a dish 
may be made, and which I saw done. 
As a substitute I have introduced the 
following english one, which has been 
generally approved; and I think, with 
particular attention, it will exceed the 
former in flavour.] 



Hodge PodgCy or Efigiyh Olio,

Directions for roastim. 

Observe that in roasting it requires 
a good quick fire, but not too strong, 
and the meats should be well-jointed, 
trimmed neat, and covered with paper 
to preserve it from being too high a co- 
lour. Beef and mutton should not be 
done too much ; veal, pork, and lamb, 
should be done well ; and some little time 



85 

before it is to be served up, take the 
paper off, sprinkle the meat with salt, 
and when of a proper coloar, froth it 
TV ith butter and flour. Ivarpe poultry to 
be papered and done in the same man- 
ner ; but small poultry, such as chickens, 
woodcocks, rabbits, wild fowls, &c. will 
not require papering. The time the se- 
veral articles will take roasting depends 
upon a little practice, as the weather and 
the different strengths of fires make a 
material alteration. I have ofivcn direc- 
tions for some particular roasts which 
require a preparation ; as for others 
which are served with sauces, they may 
be found under their respective heads : 
and for the trimmings of meat, &c. I 
have wrote a receipt to make into soup, 
or they may be put into the beef stock 
pot. 

Soup for a Family.

trimmings of different joints, as beef, 

G 3 



86 

mutton, veal, pork, &c. and when done 
put the bones into a pot, cover with 
water, and boil them till the goodness 
is extracted. Then strain the liquor, 
wash the trimmings of the vegetables, 
such as turnips, carrots, onions, leeks, 
celery, and a little cabbage. Cut all 
small, put them into a pot with the 
above liquor and some split peas ; boil 
till the peas are tender, add a little dry 
mint, and rub it through a tamis cloth 
or sieve. Then season the meat with 
pepper and salt, sweated down till three 
parts tender, and add the pulp. Boil all 
together till the meat is done, skim it and 
serve it up with fried bread in the form 
of dice. 



To prepare a Haunch of Ve7t}son, or Mutton,

Observations on Meat and Poultry, 

Meats to be preferred when of a 
good fatness and the lean appears juicy, 
but not particularly streaked with fat, as 
it then frequently happens to eat hard. 
When the season will permit let it hang 
for a week, and not more, as I have found 
that period bring it to its best state. 
Poultry, likewise, should be chosen to- 
lerably fat and of a soft grain. Let them 
hang three or four days, which will add 
to their better eating ; except woodcocks, 
snipes, larks, or pigs, w^hich should be 
dressed fresh. Be particular that the 
poultry are trussed very neat. 

Stuffing for Turhes, Hares j Veal, &c\ 

Chop very fine beef suet, parsley, 
thyme, eschallots, a very small quantity of 
marjoram, savory, basil, and lemon peel, 
wdth grated nutmeg, two eggs (or milk), 
pepper, salt, and an anchovie chopped " 
(if approved). Mix all well together. 



95

Cut slices of chuck beef, veal, and 
lean ham ; pare onions, turnips, a carrot, 
and cut them with celery ; then add a 
bunch of parsley and thyme, a few whole 
pepper, and a little mace. Put all the 
ingredients into a stewpan, set them over 
a moderate fire, sweat down till the li- 
quor becomes of a light brown colour, 
and be careful not to let it burn. Dis- 
charge it with water or beef stock, season 
to the palate with salt, and, if required, 
add a little liquid of colour. Let it sim- 
mer till the meat is perfectly done, skim 
it free from fat, and strain it through a 
tamis cloth. 



Peloe of Rice. 

Wash, pick, and dress, in the same 
manner as the directions for plain rice,

mace with the rice ; and put into a stew- 
pan a chicken half boiled and a piece of 
pickle pork three parts boiled, and cover 
with the rice. When it is to be served 
up, put the fowl and pork at the bottom 
of the dish, the rice over, and garnish

it to the fried meat and spices^ together 
w^ith some peeled button onions boiled. 
Then put some of the rice at the bottom 
of another stew-pan, then a layer of meat 
and onions on the rice, and so on alter- 
nately till the whole is put in. Cover 
the pan close, set it in a moderately 
heated oven for two hours and a half,

till half done, trim it to the shape of the 
crust, which must be big enough to put 
some light forcemeat at the bottom and 
round the ham when in the pie. Cover 
it with the same kind of paste, pinch 
round the top, and egg and ornament it. 
Just before it is set in the oven add half 
a pint of mjadeira wine, bake it gently 
for four hours, and when it is to be 
served up add some good cullis, but he 
careful it is not too salt.

Raised Ch'icken Pie, 

Cut chicken into pieces, and put them 
into a stewpan, either blanched or not, 
with a bit of fresh butter, lemon juice, 
pepper and salt, parsley, thyme, eschallots 
chopped very fine, and a little pounded 
mace. When the chicken are half done 
put them on a dish, and when cold raise 
the crust, put light forcemeat at the 
bottom, the chicken upon it, and more 
forcemeat round the top. Cover, bake 
gently, and when served up, cut off the 
lid, and add a ragout of sweetbreads, 
cocks combs, &c. &c. 

N. B. Rabbits and veal may be done 
in the same manner ; as also pigeons, but 
they are to be put into the crust w^hole. 

Flat Chicken Pie {or Tourte). 

Cut chicken into pieces, blanch them, 
and season with pepper and salt ; then 

H4 



I04 

put a light forcemeat at the bottom of 
a deep dish, and upon it some of the 
chicken, some sHces of throat sweet- 
breads seasoned, some stewed mush- 
rooms, truffles and morells, and upon 
them the remainder of the chicken. 
Cover it w^th a puff paste, then egg 
and ornament the top with leaves of 
paste of the same kind, bake it of a nice 
colour, and when it is to be served up 
put into it a good cullis. 

N. B. The chicken may be passed 
with sweet herbs, &c. and when cold 
put into the dish as above. Rabbits also 
may be done in the same manner. 



Pigeon Pie, 

Wash the pigeons in cold water and 
wipe them dry ; then put into a deep 
dish a rump steak cut into pieces, 
beat with a chopper, and seasoned with 
pepper and salt^ and upon it the pigeon^ 



105 

with the liver, &c. seasoned. Add also 
some yolk of hard eggs, cover it with 
puff paste, egg and ornament it with 
small leaves, bake it, and add some 
cuUis. 



Raked Turkey Pie with a Tongue. 

Bone a turkey, and have ready a boil- 
ed pickled tongue; pare the principal 
part, put it into the center of the turkey 
with some light forcemeat well-seasoned, 
and some slices of throat sweetbreads. 
Sew it up, and put it into boiling w^ater 
for ten minutes. Then make a crust 
with raised paste big enough to receive 
the turkey, which, when cold, put in 
with bards of fat bacon upon it and 
forcemeat at the bottom of the crust; then 
cover and ornament it as a raised chicken 
pie, and bake it. When it is to be served 
up, take off the lid and the bards of ba- 
con, glaize the breast lightly, and add a 
cullis or green trufile sauce. 



io6 

N. B. Pullets, chickens, partridges, 
and pheasants, may be done in the same 
manner ; but instead of the tongue put 
in whole green truffles pared, and some 
truffles pounded with the forcemeat, and 
when served up, add a good cullis. Or, 
instead of a raised crust, they may be 
put in a dish and covered with puff 
paste, &c. 

Raised Macaroni Pie, 

Raise a crust and ornament and bake 
it, and when it is to be served up have 
ready some hot macaroni stewed and a 
white fricassee of chicken in separate 
stewpans. Put them alternately into the 
pie, strew a little grated parmezan cheese 
over it, put a slip of paper round the edge 
of the pie to prevent from burning, and 
colour the cheese with a salamander. 



Raised Beef Sieak Pie, 

Take prime steaks of a rump of beef, 
cut the skin from the fat, beat the steaks 



107 

with a chopper, cut them into middling- 
sized pieces, then pass them with a bit 
of fresh butter, pepper, salt, lemon juice, 
and eschallots chopped, and when they 
are half done put them into a dish till 
cold. Blanch oysters, strain them, and 
preserve the liquor; then raise a crust, 
put a layer of steak at the bottom, some 
oysters upon it, and so alternately ; cover 
the pie, ornament and bake it. When 
it is to be seryed up put into it a good 
cullis, with the oyster liquor and some 
ketchup mixed w^ith it. 

IM.B. In the same manner put steaks 
and oysters into a deep dish, and cover 
them with puff paste. 



Veal Pie, 

Cut the best end of a loin of veal into 
thin chops, take off pai-t of the bone and 
some of the fat from the kidney, season 
with pepper and salt, put them into a 



io8 

deep dish with yolks of boiled eggs, cover 
with puff paste, egg and ornament with 
leaves, bake it, and when it is to be 
served up, put into it some good con- 
sume. 

Pork Pie. 

Take a piece of loin of pork with the 
rind and part of the under bone cut off;

pepper and salt, cover them with puff 
paste, bake the pie, and when it is to 
be served up put into it cullis, with the 
essence of two onions and a little mustard 
mixed with it. 

N. B. I have directed puff paste to be 
used for meat pies, it having the best 
appearance when baked; but there is 
another mode which may be thought 
preferable; and which is, to mix together 
half a pound of sifted flour, six ounces of 
fresh butter, the fo\ks> and whites of two 
eggs well beaten, and a little milk and 

salt; then knead it well.

dish, put the eels over it, cover with 
puiF paste, bake it, and put into it some 
benshamelle or cullis. 



Mutton Pie. 

Take off the bone from part of a loin 
of mutton, cut it into chops, and season

put the remaining chops over, cover with 
puff paste, bake it, and add some cullis. 
Or, the chops may be passed with sweet 
herbs, &c. and when cold put into small 



no 

or large raised crusts with the above 
vegetables, and when baked add some 
cullis. 



Sea PI

chopped fine, some flour and w^ater; 
knead them well together, then roll out 
the paste, sheet a large bowl with it, 
put into it the above ingredients alter- 
nately; cover it with the paste, put a 
cloth over, and boil four hours. When 
it is to be served up take off the cloth, 
make a little hole in the top, and add a 
good consume. 

Rissoles. 

Cut into small slips breast of fow^I, 
lean ham, pickle cucumbers, and ancho- 



Ill 

Ties; add to them consume, cayenne pep- 
per, breadcrumbs, and raw yolk of egg.

and be careful not to let the mixture burn. 
Then put the mixture on a plate, and 
when cold, cut into pieces, and dip them 
in yolk of raw egg, afterwards in fine 
breadcrumbs, and mould them with the 
hands into w^hat form you please. Have 
ready boiling lard, fry them of a nice co-

pan with a ragout spoonful of bensha- 
melle, set them over a fire for five mi- 
nutes; then put the mixture on a plate, 
and when cold roll out puff paste thin, 
cut it into square pieces, put some of 
the mixture on them, fold the paste, 
run a jagger iron round to make them 
in form of a puff, fry them in boiling 
lard, and serve them up with fried pars- 
ley under. 



Wl7igs and Legs of Fowls with Colours. 

Cut the legs from a good-sized fowl 
and the wings as large as possible, leaving 
no breast bone; then fill the cavities with 
light forcemeat, sew them up neat, blanch 
them, drain them dry, wash the tops 
with raw white of egg, and lay a small 
quantity of forcemeat on it, and work 
a sprig with slips of lean ham and white 



and yellow omlets of eggs. Then put 
them into a stewpan with a little stock, 
cover the pan close, and stew them gently 
till done and the liquor nearly reduced. 
When they are to be served up, put un- 
der a cullis boiled almost to a glaize. 

N. B. They may be done in the same 
manner and served up cold ; or put round 
them savory jelly, instead of cullis, for 
an ornamental supper. 



JVmgs and Legs larded and glaized. 

Cut the wings and legs and force them 
as before directed, then lard very neat 
and blanch them, and stew them with a 
little stock. When they are to be served

over a small quantity of salt, and serve 
them up. If they are for a dish put fried 
parsley under them, or stewed spinach. 



Directions for Poultry, &c\ plain boiled. 

Let it be observed that turkies, chick- 
ens^ and meats, intended to be plain boil- 



132 

cd, should be soaked in cold water, and 
put afterwards into plenty of boiling pump 
water, kept skimmed and preserved as 
white as possible. The time they will 
take dressing depends on a little practice, 
as in roasting. Be particular in trim- 
ming the meats neat, and in trussing the 
poultry. The carving, likewise, should 
be carefully attended to, which is fre- 
quently expressed by the phrase of cutting 
into pieces. 

Jugged Hare, 

Case the hare, cut off the shoulders 
and legs, and the back into three pieces. 
Daub them well with fat bacon, and put 
them into a stewpot with the trimmings. 
Add to them allspice, mace, whole pep- 
per, a little of each ; a small clove of gar- 
lick, three onions, two bay leaves, parsley, 
thyme, and savory, tied together in a 
small bunch ; a quart of veal stock, three 
gills of red port ; and simmer them over 
a fire till three, parts done. Then take 



123 
out the shoulders, legs, and back ; put 
them into another stewpan, strain the 
liquor to them, and add some passed 
flour and butter to thicken it a little. 
Let it stew till tender, skim it free from 
fat, season with cayenne, salt, and lemon 
juice, and serve it up in a deep dish. 

Glatzed Hare, 

Ca.se the hare, bone it as whole as 
possible, wash it, and fill the inside with 
light forcemeat ; then sew it up, and truss 
it as for roasting. Lard the back with 
bacon, the same as a fricando veal ; cover 
it with a veal caul, and roast it very 
gently. When it is to be served up, 
take off the caul, glaize the larding, and 
put strong cullis, with a gill of red port 
boiled with it, under the hare. 

Djick aux Naves. 

Bone a tame duck as whole as pos- 
sible, and season the inside with beaten: 



154 
spices, pepper, and salt ; then draw in the 
legs and wings, and fill the inside with 
light forcemeat. Sew it up, braise it in 
a pint of veal stock, cover it with white 
paper and the cover of the stewpan. 
Let it stew gently till tender, and the 
liquor almost reduced. When it is to be 
served up glaize the breast, and pour the 
sauce round it, which is to be made with 
turnips cut into shapes as for haricot ; 
afterwards to be put into a stewpan and 
sweated with a bit of fresh butter till 
three parts done ; then add a good cullis 
and the essence in which the duck was 
braised. When it boils, skim free from 
fat, season to the palate, and stew the 
turnips till done. 

A Duck with Cucumbers. 

The duck to be boned, braised, and 
served up in the same manner as the 
above, but instead of turnips put cu- 
cumber sauce, or peas, as for veal 
tendrons. 



i-5 



A Duck a la Berishamelle* 

Bone, braise, and glaize the duck as 
mentioned in the preceding article, and 
when it is to be served up put a sauce 
round it made with heads of sprue grass 
boiled in a little veal stock, and when 
tender rub them through a tamis. Add 
the pulp to a fmall quantity of bensha- 
melle, boil them together for five mi- 
nutes, and let the sauce be very white 
and strong. 

Hashed Mutton for a Dish. 

Take mutton ready dressed, cut it 
mto thin slices, put them into a stew- 
pan with slices of pickle cucumbers, or 
walnuts, or onions ; then make a sauce 
with chopped eschallots or onions passed 
with a bit of fresh butter over a slow 
fire till three parts done ; after which 
add a pint of veal stock, or gravy, and a 
little ketchup. Boil it ten minutes, sea- 



son to the palate with cayenne pepper 
and salt; then strain it to the mutton, 
let it stew gently till thoroughly hot, and 
add a small quantity of liquid of colour.

put the bones (which are to be seasoned 
with pepper and salt, and grilled) over 
the hash. 



Hashed Venison, 

Take the part least done of ready- 
dressed venison, cut it in slices, and put 
them into a stewpan ; then pass a bit of 
fresh butter and flour and chopped es- 
challots over a slow fire for ten minutes, 
and add to them half a pint of red port, 
a pint and a half of veal stock, its own 
gravy, if any, a little piece of lemon peel, 
cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice. 
Season to the palate, boil all together a 
quarter of an hour, and strain it to the 
venison. Let it simmer gently till tho- 
roughly hot. 



127 

N. B. The venison should not be put 
into the liquor above ten minutes before 
it is to be served up, by reason of the fat 
dissolving too much. 

Hashed Fowls. 

Cut into pieces (very neat) ready- 
dressed fow^ls, turkies, or rabbits, and 
put them into a stevvpan ; then make a 
thickening with a bit of fresh butter, 
flour, and chopped eschallots or onions 
mixed over a slow fire. Discharge it 
with veal stock, add a little lemon pickle 
and ketchup, season to the palate, put a 
small quantity of liquid of colour, boil for 
ten minutes, strain to the poultry, and 
let it stew gently. When served up, there 
may be put a few pieces of the fowl 
grilled round it. 

N. B. Instead of the thickening and 
veal stock, may be added cuUis w4th le- 
mon pickle and ketchup. 



u8 

Hashed Hare, Wild Fowl, Pheasants, of 
Partridges, 

Cut the poultry into neat pieces, put 
them into a stewpan, and add a liquor

or put culUs and red port with their own 
gravy. 

Broiled Beef Steaks. 

Take a small fat rump of beef, and 
cut off the fillet and the first two or three 
steaks ; then cut the remainder into 
steaks also, and cut the skin from the 
fat. Beat them with a chopper, and 
season with pepper and salt just before 
they are to be put on the gridiron^, which 
should be wxU cleaned, and the steaks 
frequently turned. When they are done 
according to desire, serve them up on 
a hot dish with a little gra\y under, 
some scraped horseradish, chopped es- 
challots, and pickles, on small plates^ and 



i2g 

oyster sauce in a sauce boat, or with 
slices of onions dipped in batter and 
fried. 

N. B. The fillet and outside steaks of 
the rump may be made into a pudding, 
in order to have prime steaks for broiling. 

Beef Steak Pudding. 

Take flour, chopped suet, some milk, 
a little salt, and one egg, and mix them 
well together. Roll out the paste of half 
an inch thick, and sheet a bason or a 
bowl with it. Then trim the skin from 
the meat, beat the steaks well with a 
chopper, cut them into middling-sized 
pieces, season with pepper and salt, put 
them into the bason with blanched 
oysters and slices of potatoes alternately 
(or slices of onions, if approved). Cover 
the top with paste, and tie a cloth over 
the bason. Boil the pudding (if of a 
middling size) two hours ; and when it 
is to be served up put into it a little cullis 
and ketchup.

same kind of cream as for pies, and when 
cold put it over the ingredients. When 
it is to be served up put plenty of the 
stiff froth of a syllabub raised high on 
the cream, and garnish with coloured 



comfits or rose leaves, which are recom- 
mended for elegance. 

Tarts or Tartlets, 

Sheet tart or tartlet pans with puff' 
paste a quarter of an inch thick, trim 
round the edge with a sharp knife; then 
fill with raspberry or apricot jam, or 
orange marmalade or stewed apple, and 
put fine strings of paste across in what 
form you please. Bake them in a brisk 
oven, and be careful not to let the top 
colour too much. 

Faste for stringing Tartlets,

mix with it half a handful of flour, a 
little cold water, and let it be of a mo- 
derate stiffness, and mould it w-ith the 
hands till it draws into fine threads. 
Roll a piece out three inches long and 
two inches broad* then cut it into slips. 



503 

draw them out singly, and put them 
across the tarts in any form, which may 
be repeated two or three times over each 
other, as it will add much to their ap- 
pearance when baked. 



To stew Apples for Tarts, 

Pare, cut into quarters, and core, some 
apples; put them into a stewpan, add to 
them a piece of lemon peel, a little water, 
and a stick of cinnamon. Cover the 
pan close, put it over a fire till the apples 
are dissolved, sweeten to the palate with 
sifted sugar, add a table spoonful of syrup 
of cloves, and rub them through a hair 
sieve. Let it stand till cold before it is 
pat into the paste. 

N. B. To make a very fine flavoured 
tart, stew golden pippins in the same man- 
ner, and when they are rubbed through 
the sieve add only half a table spoonful 
of syrup of cloves, and mix well with it 



204 

a quarter of a pound of pine-apple jam. 
This mixture will keep a month if close 
covered. 



Fried Ptiffs with Sweetmeats, 

Roll out puff paste half an inch 
thick, cut it into slips of three inches 
wide, the slips into square pieces, and 
put on each some sweetmeat of any 
kind. Fold the paste, and run a jagger 
iron round to form it, or cut it with a 
sharp knife. Have ready boiling lard,» 
fry them of a light colour, drain them 
dry, and serve them up with sifted sugar 
over. 



Fyramid Paste, 

Take a sheet of puff paste rolled of 
half an inch thick ; cut or stamp it into 
oval forms, the first to be the size of the

20S 

tin It becomes a pyramid; then put each 
piece separately on paper laid on a baking 
plate, and when the oven is ready, egg 
the top part of the pieces and bake them 
of a light colour. When they are done 
take them off the paper, lay them on a 
large dish till quite cold, and when to be 
served up set the largest piece in the 
dish for which it was formed, and put 
on it raspberry or apricot jams or currant 
jelly, the next size on that and more 
sweetmeats, proceeding in the same man- 
ner till all the pieces are placed on each 
other. Put dried fruits round the pyra- 
mid, such as green gages, barberries, or 
cherries. 

N. B. Instead of stamping the pieces 
it is thought better to cut them with a 
sharp knife; then to cut out small pieces 
round the edges to make them appear like 
spires, as, being done in this manner, It 
causes the paste to appear lighter.

Observation on Stores. 

As frequent mention is made of syrups, 
jams, pounded spices, sugar fifted, grated 



22,g 

nutmeg, and orange flower water, to be 
used in puddings and pies ; and as a very 
small quantity of each is wanted at a 
time ; it is therefore recommended (as a 
saving of trouble and expence) that the 
syrups, &c. be made when the fruits are 
in season, and preserved in small bottles 
with the different stores. But should any 
of the receipts be thought too expensive 
or rich, it is recommended, likewise, that 
a curtailment be made in some of the 
articles, pursuing nearly the same process, 
they being written in that flate only to 
shew their first and best manner. The 
same observation may be borne in re- 
membrance with respect to made dishes, 
roafling, paflry, or sauces. 

Partridge Soup,

drawn partridges or pheasants, an old 
fowl, a knuckle of veal, some lean ham,

Q3 



230 

pot with half a pint of water, set them

Riiles to he observed hi PlckUng, 

It is recommended that the best com- 
mon vinegar be in general used for pick- 
ling, and that it be put into a well- 
cleaned copper or brass-preserving pan 
just before it is to be put over the fire, 
and when it boils not to remain in the 
pan. 

There can be no occasion of the many 
arts that are used in order to preserve 
the ingredients green, if the vegeta- 
bles are gathered fresh, on a dry day, 
when in season, and the process fol- 
lowed that has been recommended. 

Further directions could be given that 
might be attended with greater expence, 

R3 



54^ 

but which would scarcely answer a bet- 
ter purpose, excepting only to those who 
are in the habit of extensive practice. 

To ptclle Onions. 

Peel small button onions into milk 
and water, in which put plenty of salt ; 
set it over a fire, and when it boils strain 
the onions, wipe them dry, and put them 
into glasses. Have ready cold white wine 
vinegar, in which whole white pepper, 
ginger, mace, and slices of horseradish 
have been boiled. Pour it over the 
onions, and cover them with bladder 
and leather. 

To pickle Mushrooms, 

Take a sufficient quantity of double 
distilled white wine vinegar to cover the 
mushrooms ; add to it whole white pep- 
per, ginger, mace, peeled eschallots, and 
a small quantity of garlick if approved ; 
boil all together ten minutes and let it 
Stand till cold. Then peel fresh forced 



547 
button mushrooms into water, wash 
them clean, strain, and put them into 
a stewpan. To a quart of mushrooms 
add the juice of a lemon and a table 
spoonful of salt. Cover the pan close, 
set it over a fire, and when the liquor 
is sufficiently drawn from the mush- 
rooms put the whole into glasses and 
cover them with the pickle. Tie blad- 
der and white leather over the glasses. 

The general rule has been deviated 
from of making the pickle for onidns 
and mushrooms with double distilled 
white wine vinegar, as in this instance 
it is requisite to preserve them white. 
It is likewise recommended that they be 
put into small jars or glasses for use; for 
this reason, that, if exposed to the air 
but for a short space of time, they will 
discolour. 

To pickle Beet Roots. 

Boil the roots till three parts done, 
and cut them into slices of an inch 
R 4 



548 

thick. Then take a sufficient quan- 
tity of vinegar to cover them, and add 
to it whole allspice, a few cloves, mace, 
black pepper, slices of horseradish, some 
onions, eschallots, a little pounded gin- 
ger, some salt, and a few bay leaves. 
Boil the ingredients together twenty mi- 
nutes and strain it, and when the pickle 
is cold add a little bruised cochineal. 
Put the slices of beet into jars, add- the 
pickle, put a small quantity of sweet 
oil on the top, and tie the jars down 
close. 

N. B. When the beet is wanted for 
use mix well together sweet oil, mus- 
tard, some of the liquor in which the 
roots wxre pickled, and a very little sifted 
sugar. Lay the slices in a deep plate 
and pour the mixture over. 

To pickle Artldioh Bottoms. 

Take large fresh and sound arti- 
chokes, boil them just enough to take 



249 

the leaves and choke away, then trim 
and lay them in salt and water ; after 
which boil (for five minutes) a sufficient 
quantity of vinegar to cover them, in 
which put whole alUpice, black pepper, 
ginger, mace, cloves, eschallots, salt, a 
few bay leaves, and some slices of horse- 
radish. Drain and wipe dry the bot- 
toms, put them into jars, add the liquor 
and ingredients to them, and tie them 
down close. When they are fit for use 
serve them up in a deep plate with a 
little of the pickle, oil, and mustard 
mixed with it. 



To pickle large CMCumhers, 

Peel them very thin, cut them into 
halves, throw the seeds away, and lay 
the cucumbers in salt for a day. Then 
wipe them dry, fill them with mustard 
seed, peeled eschallots, garlick, small 
slips of horseradish, and mace. After 
which tie them round with twine, put 
them into jars, pour over them some 



boiling liquor made as for india pickle 
or for jerkins, and cover them down 
close till fit for use. 

To pickle Red Cabbage. 

Cut a fresh light red cabbage into 
slips^ wash it clean^, and put it into a 
pan with plenty of salt for two days. 
Then boil together for half an hour a 
suiEcient quantity of vinegar to cover 
the cabbage, together with bruised black 
pepper^ mace, allspice, clores, ginger, 
nutmeg, and mustard seed, a middling 
quantity of each. Strain the vinegar 
and ingredients, and let them stand till 
cold; then add a little bruised cochineal, 
drain the cabbage on a large sieve till dry, 
put it into the jars, add the pickle, and 
tie the jars down close; or the liquor 
may be poured over the cabbage boiling 
hot ; and when cold, before the jars are 
tied down, add a little bruised cochineal. 
This method will make the cabbage 
sooner fit for use. 



N. B. Onions may be peeled and done 
whole in the same manner, and mixed 
with red cabbage. 

To pickle Currants, 

To a quart of double diftilled white 
wine vinegar add half a pound of loaf 
sugar, whole ginger, one ounce of salt,

and sifted coriander seeds, and so on al- 
ternately ; when the tub is nearly full 
put a weight over to press it well, and 
set it in a cold dry place covered with 
a coarse cloth. When it is wanted for 
use put some of the cabbage into boiling 
water over a fire for five minutes, and 
strain it. Have ready some pieces of 



^55 
salted bouillie beef (of a quarter of a 
pound each) nearly boiled enough ; like- 
wise some pieces of pickle pork of the 
same number and weight. Then put 
them into a stevvpan, add the cabbage, 
fresh butter, a little vinegar, onions 
sliced very thin, some whole pepper, 
allspice, and mace, tied in a bit of cloth. 
Let all stew till tender; then take out

Lobster Sauce Jor Fish, 

Take the spawn out of live lobsters 
before they are boiled, bruise it well in 
a marble mortar, add a little cold water, 
strain it through a fiev'e and preserve it 
till wanted ; then boil the lobsters, and 
when three parts done pick and cut 
the meat into small pieces, and put it 
into a stev^pan. To the meat of a large 
lobster add a pound of fresh butter and 
a pint of water, including a sufficient 
quantity of the spawn liquor to colour it. 
Put it over a fire, thicken it with flour 
and water, keep stirring till it boils, and 
then season to the palate with anchovie 
liquor, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. 
Let it simmer five minutes and skim it. 

N. B. In place of the above the fol- 
lowing method may be adopted: — lu- 



2i6s 

stead of cutting the meat of the lobster 
into pieces, it may be pounded in a 
marble mortar, then rubbed through a 
tamis cloth, and the pulp put with the 
other ingredients when the sauce is to be 
made. [See Aiichovle Essence for Fish 
SauceJl

Shrimp Sauce for Fish, 

Boil live shrimps in salt and water 
for three minutes, then pick, wash, and

juice, cayenne pepper, and flour and 
water to make it of a sufficient thick-. 
ness. Put the ingredients over a fire, 
and when it boils skim it, and let the 
shrimps simmer for five minutes. Or it 
may be made thus : — When the shrimps 
are picked, wash the shells, drain them 
dry, put them into a stewpan, add a little 
water, and boil them ten minutes ; then 
strain the liquor to the butter (as above) 
instead of the water, which will make it 
of a better flavour. The bodies of lob- 
sters, also, when picked, may be done 
in like manner for lobster sauce.

tea spoonful of India soy if approved, a 
sufficient quantity of flour and water to 
make it of a proper thickness. Make the 
inixture boil, and skim it clean. 

Observations in respect cf Fish Sauces, &c. 

Let it be particularly observed that 
fish sauces should be of the thickness of 



z66 

light batter, so that it might adhere to 
the fish when dressed, it being a frequent 
error that they are either too thick or too 
thin. The thickening should be made 
with the best white flour sifted, and some 
water, mixed smooth with a wooden 
spoon or a whisk, and to be of the con- 
sistence of light batter also. A little of 
it is recommended to be always ready 
where there is much cooking, as it is fre- 
quently wanted both in fish and other 
sauces. 

There are, likewise, other articles re- 
peatedly wanted for the use of stove- 
work ; and as their possession has 
been found to obviate much incon- 
venience and trouble, they are here 
enumerated : that is to say, liquid of co- 
lour preserved in a bottle, strained lemon 
juice preserved in the same manner, 
cayenne pepper, ground spices, ground 
pepper and salt mixed, which should be 
preserved separately in small jars ; and 
every day, when wanted, fresh bread- 
crumbs rubbed through a hair sieve ; 



267 

parsley, thymes, eschallots, savoy, mar- 
joram, and lemon peel, chopped very 
fine, and put on a dish in separate 
partitions. 

Directions are not given for serving 
the fish sauces with any particular kind 
of fish, — such as turbot or salmon wath 
lobster sauce, &c. but the receipts have 
been written only for the making them; 
therefore it is recommended that every 
person make a choice, and not be biassed 
altoo;ether bv custom. 



Apple Sauce for Pork, Geese, &c\ 

Pare, quarter, and core, baking apples; 
put them into a stewpan, add a bit of 
lemon rind, a small stick of cinnamon, a 
few cloves, and a small quantity of 
water. Cover the pan close, set it ovcr 
a moderate fire, and when the apples are 
tender take the peel and spices out ; then 
add a bit of fresh butter, and sugar to the 
palate. i 



^68 



Gree?t Sauce for Ducklings or Gree?i Geese, 

Pick green spinach or sorrel, wash it, 
and bruise it in a marble mortar, and 
strain the liquor through a tamis cloth. 
To a gill of the juice add a little loaf 
sugar, the yolk of a raw egg, and a 
jspoonful of vinegar ; if spinach juice, 
then put one ounce of fresh butter, and 
whisk all together oyer a fire till it begins 
to boiL 

N. B. Should the sauce be made of 
spinach juice instead of vinegar, there 
may be put two table spoonfuls of the 
pulp of gooseberries rubbed through a 
)iair sieve. 



Fennel Sauce for Mackarel, 

Pick green fennel, mint, and parsley,, 
a little of each ; wash, boil them till 
tender, drain and press them, chop them 
fine, add melted butter, and serve up the 
sauce immediately, for should the herbs 



^6g 

be mixed with the butter any length of* 
time before it is served up, they will 
be discoloured. The same observation 
should be noticed in making parsley and 
butter sauce. 



Bread Sauce, for TurUes, Game, &c. 

Soak a piece of crumb of bread wdth 
half a pint of milk or cream, add a 
peeled middling-sized onion, and put 
them over a fire ; w^ien the milk is ab- 
sorbed bruise the bread, mix with it 
two ounces of fresh butter, a little white 
pepper, and salt ; and when it is to be 
served up take out the onion. 

Melted Bntter. 

In order to prevent butter from oiling, 
the flour and water that may be sufficient 
for the quantity of butter should be made 
boiling, skimmed clean, and the butter 
added to dissolve, being careful it is of a 
proper thickness. 
6 



In the same manner may be made fish 
sauces, adding the liquor of the lobsters 
or oysters, &c. with flour and water, and 
when boiling add the butter with the 
other ingredients.

and let them simmer a quarter of an 
hour ; the next day boil them up again, 
and so on for three days ; then take them 
out, and add to the syrup some moun- 
tain wine, a little brandy, and more 
sugar ; clarify it, and boil it nearly to a 
candied height, put the melons into it 
and boil them five mmutes ; then put 
th:"m in glasses, and cover them close 
with bladder and leather.

till cold. In the mean time put a pint 
of cream or new milk into a stewpan, 
■with a stick of cinnamon, a small piece 
of lemon peel, sugar, a few cloves and 
coriander seeds, and boil the ingredients 
ten minutes. Have ready the yolks of 
six eggs and a little flour and water well 
beaten ; strain the milk to them, w^hisk 
it over a fire to prevent it from curdling, 
w^hen it nearly toils set the pan in cold 
water, stir the cream for five minutes, 
and let it stand till cold. Then mix the 
pulp of the gooseberries and the cream 
together, add a little grated nutmeg, 
and sweeten it more if agreeable to the 
palate.

them in a moderate oven till thoroughly 
heated through, and set them in a dry 
cool place. 

N. B. Damsons, currants, cherries, or 
plums may be done in the same way. 

[The above mode of preserving fruits 
is recommended in preference to preserv- 
ing them with sugar, it frequently hap- 



2^3 

pcning that fruits done with syrup will 
fret, and in that event the whole be 
spoiled.] 

To bottle Gooseberries another way. 

When the gooseberries are picked put 
them into the bottles and cover them

extremely well. The small champaign 
gooseberry is recommended likewise for 
the purpose.]

Conclusion, with Remarks. 

All sweets, pastry, shellfish or savoury 
dishes, either plain or modelled, with fat 
or butter, or ornaments of any kind, that 
are served up in second courses or ball 
suppers, &c. should be very light, airy, 
and neat ; the pastry, likewise, of the 
best pufF paste, well-baked, and rather 
inclining to a pale colour, which has a 
very good effect. 

Let it also be observed, that mention 
should have been made in the receipt 
for Mock Turtle, of an addition to the 
passing of flour and butter, to each gal- 
lon of liquor half a pint of madeira wine; 
and (if approved) the mock turtle may 
be made with pieces of cow-heel or pig's 
head instead of calf's scalp.
