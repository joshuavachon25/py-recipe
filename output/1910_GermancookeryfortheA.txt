GERMAN COOKERY 



FOR THE 



AMERICAN HOME. 



BY 



ELLA OSWALD. 



NEW YORR. 
THE BAKER AND TAYLOR CO.

Printed in England. 



PREFACE. 



This representative selection of German recipes, 
translated into English and adapted to the utensils, 
weights and measures in use in an English kitchen, 
will, I trust, prove acceptable to many who, having 
passed some time in Germany, may like to renew their 
acquaintance with German cookery. Others, who have 
made England the land of their adoption, may also find 
this a useful little book to place in the hands of their 
English cooks, who will thereby be able more easily 
to prepare many familiar and favourite dishes unknown 
to this country. 

As a rule, only those recipes have been given whose 
ingredients are as readily obtainable in England as in 
Germany. Those have been included, however, whose 
essentially German components, such as Sardellen (for 
which Anchovies may be substituted). Sauerkraut, 
Senfgurken, Pumpernickel, etc., can be easily procured 
at any of the German Delikatessen Handlungen existing 
in London and most of our larger towns. 

It was whilst staying in the house of a hospitable 
German friend at Frinton-on-Sea, at all seasons one of 
most refreshing and idyllic of sea-side resorts on our 
East Coast, that the idea of bringing out a German 
Cookery Book in our language was first suggested to me. 
I record this fact from a sense of gratitude to a place 
that has endeared itself to me and to many others by its 
never-fading charm : facing the sea, the prettiest of little 
houses, nestling in their gardens ; behind, the wide 
vista of a delightful countryside, and before them the 
broad greensward, stretching to the edge of the cliff, 
whose foot is lapped — or lashed, as the elements may 
decree — by the waves of the German Ocean.

5^

Two Quarts of Soup. 

24 small crayfish. 

3 oz. butter. 

4 oz. flour.

Time of Preparation : 2 hours. 

Parsley and carraway seeds. 
I teaspoonful chopped fennel. 
I teaspoonful chopped onion, 
i^ teaspoonsful Meat 
Extract. 
Yolks of 2 eggs. 



Wash the crayfish in cold water and then boil them 
for 10 minutes in boiling water, with salt, carraway 
seeds and parsley. When cold, divide them, leaving 
the claws (out of which the meat is taken) whole, to put 
into the soup. The shells of the crayfish may be stuffed 
and also put into the soup, in which case they should be 
slit up at the side, that the stuffing can be readily taken 
out at table. The gall, in the head ; the intestine, lying 
along the tail ; and the gray threads lying along the 
side must be removed altogether. Pound the remaining 
portions of the shells as finely as possible, then fry in 
the butter for 2 minutes ; add the flour and fry again 
for 3 minutes. Add the stock, 2 tablespoonsful of 
carrots and turnips chopped finely, a teaspoonful of 
chopped fennel, a pinch of carraway and half a tea- 
spoonful of chopped onion. Leave all well covered to 
simmer for half an hour. Then strain through a sieve 
and stir in the yolks of 2 eggs, unbeaten. The eggs 
may also be omitted.

FISCHE. 

{Fish.) 



Fische im Wasserbade gekocht. 

(Steamed Fish.) 

This method of preparing fish is the most delicate, as 
well as the most wholesome. 

For 6 Persons, Time of Preparation : i hour. 

2 lbs. fish. I J to 2 tablespoonsful salt. 

I piece celery. i onion. 

I parsley root. A few peppercorns. 

Clean the fish thoroughly, rub the salt well into it, place 
it in an enamel stewpan, or small enamelled fish-kettle, 
with the onion, celery, and parsley-root (all cut up) and 
peppercorns arranged round it, and stand the pan, 
covered, in a cool place for half an hour. 

Then place the stewpan, still firmly closed, in a larger 
saucepan or fish-kettle, in which there is sufficient boiling 
water to come to the top of the contents in the inner 
pan. Cover this outer saucepan tightly so that no 
steam may escape and keep the water boiling for 25 to 30 
minutes. To ascertain whether the fish is sufficiently 
boiled, the lids must of course be lifted from each sauce- 
pan, and when the steam has been allowed to escape, 
the condition of the fish can be tested with a larding 
needle. If the meat lifts readily off the backbone, then 
the fish is done. 

Serve with butter, melted or browned, or with various 
sauces (see recipes under section "Sauces"), for the 
making of which the broth that has formed during the 
cooking of the fish should be used. 

Salmon should not be prepared in this manner, but 
haddock and cod are excellent so prepared. 



Fish. 27 

Fisch mit pikanter Sauce. 

(Fish with Piquant Sauce.) 
For 8 Persons. Time of Preparation : i hour. 

4 lbs. haddock or 

2\ lbs. pike, perch, carp, etc. 

4 oz. butter.

4 teaspoonful Liebig's Meat 
Extract, dissolved in 

\ pint water. 

\ tablespoonful chopped 
parsley. 

2 tablespoonsful chopped 
onion. 

I tablespoonful capers. 



2 tablespoonsful lemon juice 

Clean the fish well, cut it into medium-sized pieces, 
rub them over with salt and parsley, and stand in a cool 
place for 10 minutes. 

Mix the butter, flour, mustard, and cayenne to a stiff 
paste. Cover the bottom of a stewpan with small lumps 
of this paste, add half the quantity of the onions, capers, 
and mushrooms. Put in the pieces of fish, and then the 
rest of the paste in small pieces, and the remainder of 
the onions, capers, and mushrooms. Pour over this 
the lemon juice and the water in which the Meat 
Extract should first have been dissolved. 

Cover the stewpan tightly and stand it in a larger 
saucepan, in which there is sufficient boiling water to 
come to the level on the top of the contents in the inner 
pan. Cover this outer saucepan tightly, to prevent any 
steam escaping, and keep the water boiling 20 to 25 
minutes. Then take out the inner stewpan, bring the 
fish just to the boil and serve.

tomato puree over them, then put in the pieces of fish 
and cover with the remainder of the puree. 

Pour over this the water with the Meat Extract dissolved 
in it, cover the stewpan tightly and place it in a larger 
saucepan in which there is sufficient boiling water to 
come to the level of the top of the contents in the inner 
pan. Cover this outer saucepan tightly to prevent any 
steam escaping, and keep the water boiling for 30 
minutes. Then take out the inner stewpan, bring the 
fish just to the boil and serve.

Place little lumps of this paste in a stewpan with the 
parsley root (cut in two), an onion, and some of the 
chopped parsley and dill. On this place the fish, which 
has been well cleaned, cut into medium-sized pieces and 
rubbed over with salt, and cover the fish with the 
remainder of the paste, in little lumps, and a little more 
of the dill and parsley. Pour over this the cream and 
cover the stewpan tightly. 

Place the pan in a larger saucepan, in which there is 
sufficient boiling water to come to the top of the contents 
in the inner pan. Cover this outer saucepan tightly, so 
that no steam may escape, and keep the water boiling 
for 25 to 30 minutes. Then take out the inner stewpan 
and put it directly on the fire, so that the fish comes just 
to the boil. Then add the remainder of the chopped 
parsley and dill. Before serving, remove the parsley root 
and the onion. 



Fish. 29 

Fische auf einfache Art gekocht. 

(Fish — Plain boiled. ) 



Fischblau. 

(Fish prepared to appear Blue.) 

The most suitable fish to be prepared in this manner are : 
Carp, tench, bream., trout, eel, and salmon. 

To prepare a fish so that when boiled it appears bluish, 
do not scrape off the scales when cleaning, and pour 
over it dilute hot vinegar, leaving it then exposed to 
the air for a while. The blue colour is produced by the 
action of the vinegar and air on the colouring matter of 
the skin. 

After this treatment, put the fish on in cold salt water, 
allowing about 2 oz. salt to every quart of water, and 
adding some peppercorns, onions and soup herbs 
(carrots, parsley root, celery, etc.). It is advisable to 
boil the onions and soup herbs previously in a little water 
for half an hour and to add the broth so obtained to the 
water in which the fish is boiled, as it takes longer to 
extract the goodness out of the vegetables by boiling 
than to boil the fish. 

Fish boiled whole should be tied to the drainer of the 
fish-kettle. 

Large fish must be brought slowly to the boil, small 
fish quickly, the lid being kept on the fish-kettle. The 
fish should then be placed a little on one side and 
allowed to simmer quite gently till done. Then dash a 
little cold water over it and let it remain a few minutes 
longer in the kettle before serving. 

To ascertain whether the fish is done, insert a larding 
needle carefully into the middle of the back. If the flesh 
is readily lifted from the backbone, then the fish is done. 

Lift out the drainer with the fish on it, allow the water 
to strain off thoroughly, remove quickly the thread 
which has kept the fish in place, and slide the latter on 
to a dish, which may, or may not, be covered with a 



30 Fische. 

serviette. Garnish with parsley and small boiled po- 
tatoes. 

Serve with brown butter sauce (with or without 
German mustard), or merely oiled butter, or Dutch, 
Mushroom, Caviar, or Oyster Sauce. Mayonnaise or 
Remouladen Sauce may also be taken. {See section 
" Sauces " for the various recipes.) 

Every kind of fish can be boiled in this manner, 
without being rendered bluish, the fish being merely 
thoroughly cleaned and the scales removed. 



Lachsblan. 

(Boiled Salmon.) 

Clean and wash the salmon, leaving the scales on, 
however, if the fish is to appear bluish. In this case 
pour over it a little dilute boiling vinegar, then' let it 
stand a few minutes and tie it on to the drainer, placing 
latter into the fish-kettle. Pour over it sufficient cold 
water, strongly salted (2 oz. to the quart) to cover the 
fish well. 

Add plenty of onions, carrots, turnips, parsley root, 
and celery and half a gill of Tarragon vinegar. Bring 
slowly to the boil, covered, and then stand on one side 
to simmer very gently i to | hour, according to size of 
the fish. {See last recipe for ascertaining when a fish 
is sufficiently boiled for serving.) When done, leave in 
the fish-kettle for another quarter of an hour. 

Serve on a long dish, garnished with parsley and 
slices of lemon. Hand round with it oiled butter, Dutch 
sauce, whipped cream with horseradish, etc. {See section 
" Sauces " for the various recipes.)

(Boiled Sole.) 

Reckon about \ lb. sole Time of Preparation : f hour. 

to each Person. 

Smaller fish are boiled without being skinned. Larger 
ones should always be skinned. To do so, cut through 



Fish. 3 1 

the skin very carefully just round the tail and by the 
fins, and loosen it by slipping a knife under it. Then 
hold the fish firmly by the tail with a cloth and draw off 
the skin carefully from the tail towards the head. Both 
the white and the grey skins must be removed. 

Clean the fish well, lay it on a fish-slice and put it on 
to boil in cold water, strongly salted (i oz. salt to the 
quart of water) and with a little lemon juice in it. Bring 
to the boil and then stand on one side to simmer very 
gently for another lo minutes. 

Serve on a hot dish, garnished with parsley. Dutch, 
Mushroom or Oyster Sauce should be handed round 
with it. {See various recipes in section "Sauces.") 



Flonder gekocht. 

(Boiled Plaice.) 

Skin and clean the plaice. Strew salt over it and 
leave to stand for 2 hours. Then boil in the same 
manner as sole (see previous recipe), adding onions to 
the water. 

Serve with Dutch Sauce. 



Forellen. 

(Trout.) 

Clean the trout thoroughly, leave the scales on and 
pour some hot vinegar over them to make them bluish. 
Then stand on one side for a little while. 

Pass a thread of cotton through the head and tail 
of each fish, tying it together, so that the fish forms a 
ring. 

Fill the fish-kettle with very slightly salted water. 
When the water is boiling furiously, plunge in the 
drainer on which the trout have been arranged. 

Then immediately remove from the fire again. Small 
trout are sufficiently cooked by the mere plunging into 
boiling water — larger ones should be allowed to remain 
in the water for 3 minutes after the fish-kettle has been 
removed from the fire. 



32 Fische. 

Serve on a dish covered with a serviette, first removing 
the threads carefully. Garnish with parsley, crisp 
lettuce leaves and slices of lemon. ,„„/!,' 

Fresh butter in little balls or rolls, or oiled butter with 
chopped parsley in it, should be handed round with the 
trout, which must alv/ays be served very hot.

Fish to be boiled in white sauce must be most 
thoroughly cleaned or the flavour of the sauce will 
suffer. Scrape off all the scales, as well as cleaning. 
With haddock, cod, herring and plaice remove the head 
altogether ; with the other fish, it may be cooked with it, 
but should be well scraped. Cut the fish when cleaned 
into medium pieces, and place (in cases where the heads 
are retained, the heads should be placed lowermost) in 
2^ pints of white sauce {see recipe, page 55), which 
should be hot, but not boiling. Bring slowly to the 
boil, add the butter, chopped onions, grated almonds, 
pepper and the cream, and finally, when the fish is done, 
the finely-chopped parsley. Then stand on one side for 
25 minutes, not allowing further boiling.

Scrape the scales off thoroughly, cut out the gills, and 
before cutting open the fish, wash it well and dry it with 
a cloth. Then place it on a board, cut off the fins, 
shorten the tail, cut the fish open and remove all the 
entrails carefully, so that the gall does not break. Only 
the gall and the thickest intestine are thrown away— 
the other portions are boiled with the fish ; neither they 
nor the inside of the fish itself must be washed, or the 
special carp flavour will be lost. Now cut up the fish 
into medium-sized pieces, splitting open the head. 
Strew salt over them and stand, covered over, in a cool 
place for an hour. 

Make a Polish sauce (see recipe, page 63). Place the 
fish in it, the head at the bottom, and boil it in this 
sauce. When it has boiled up once, taste the sauce, to 
see if it need the addition of any more salt. 

In making the sauce, half the quantity of beer may be 
taken, red wine being substituted for the other half, or 
wine be altogether substituted for the beer. 

Bream, tench and roach may be prepared in like 
manner, but must be completely cleaned, both inside 
and out. 

(Sea Fish in Beer Sauce.) 

Sea fish taste excellent if cooked in beer sauce, accord- 
ing to previous recipe, but after cutting them up, put 
them on to boil in cold water, strongly salted. When 
the water just boils, take the fish out and finish boiling 
it in the beer sauce, the heads being removed alto- 
gether. 

Gurnet should be scalded and skinned before being 
boiled in the beer sauce.

4 oz. Parmesan cheese. { green herbs. 

4 oz. butter. 

I small toast loaf. 



1 tablespoonful capers. 

2 tablespoonsful lemon juice.

Put a layer of grated Parmesan cheese on each piece of 
toast, and on that arrange the Sardellen, which have 
been previously soaked in milk, strewing over them a

Serve as an entree. 



Erebse. 

(Crayfish.) 



In buying crayfish, care should be taken that the tails 
are curved in. Should the tails be stretched out straight, 
the crayfish are dead. The same applies to lobsters. 

If the crayfish do not appear clean, they should be 
cleansed by brushing and then well washed. 

To boil a dozen crayfish reckon from i to 2 quarts 
of water, according to size. They must boil lo to 15 
minutes slowly, and then be drawn to one side to simmer 
slowly for another quarter of an hour. 

To each quart of water add i oz. of salt, a few carraway 
seeds, a small onion, and some parsley. Let the water 
boil briskly before throwing in the live crayfish and throw 
each in separately, letting the water boil up again before 
the next be thrown in. To throw all in at once sends 
the water off the boil for some time and, thus preventing 
instant death, is an unnecessary cruelty. 

When the crayfish are boiled, serve in a tureen with 
some of the broth in which they have been boiled, to

served in scallop shells, the sauce being poured over 
them.

Gansebraten. 

(Roast Goose.) 

Rub the goose over, inside and out, with salt. Place 
in it several stalks of marjoram and fill with little apples, 
then sewing together. The apples should be cored, but 



Game and Poultry. 79 

not peeled. For only apples may be substituted a 
mixture of i lb. apples, peeled and cut up, \ lb. 
sultanas, and a tablespoonful each of sugar and bread- 
crumbs ; or a mixture of i lb. apples, peeled and cut up, 
and I lb. chestnuts, boiled and peeled. 

Place the goose breast downwards, in the deep baking- 
pan, pour over it a pint of boiling water, place an onion 
in the tin, and put into a mediumly hot oven. Let it 
remain so for half an hour, then turn it. Prick the 
skin round the wings and legs frequently, to let the fat 
run out. Baste well and add more water whenever it 
has boiled away in cooking and the goose is roasting 
too quickly. The roasting should occupy from 2 to 2^ 
hours, and the goose should be then of a bright brown 
colour. At the very last, a few spoonsful of cold water 
should be poured over the goose, which should then be 
allowed to continue roasting for a few minutes, that the 
skin may become crisp. 

Remove the fat from the gravy, which may be 
thickened with a little flour or grated Pfefferkuchen.

little celery and peppercorns and stew until done. Then 
take out the giblets and strain off the broth. 

Prepare a white " Grundsauce " (see recipe, page 55) 
with the butter, flour, and the broth, which should have 
boiled down to about i^ pint. Flavour with finely- 
chopped parsley and pour over the giblets. 

Little meat balls, or Semmel- or Kartoffelklosse 
(see recipes, page 22) boiled in the sauce, are an 
improvement to this dish.

dish. Strain off the broth (reduced to about 2 quarts), 
remove any fat, add more vinegar and salt if necessary 
clear with white of ^^^ and pounded eggshells, strain 
through a cloth and pour over the meat. Should 
gelatine be used instead of pigs' trotters, reckon \ oz. to 
each quart of broth.

and some soup herbs, such as carrots, turnips, and a 
little celery and parsley root, and braise the duck in 
this, turning frequently, and adding water whenever the 
gravy seems much reduced in quantity. When the

the meat with it. 

Rub the meat with the salt and dredge a little flour 
over it. 

Brown the butter or fat in a deep baking-pan, put into 
it the meat and let it get brown on all sides. Then add 
the onion, soup herbs, etc., and enough water for the 
lower half of the meat to be always standing in a thickish 
gravy. 

When the meat is done, take it out, removing the 
string, and prepare the sauce. 

If it is not yet thick enough, add a little flour, then 
strain through a sieve. A gill of sour cream, or of

the vegetables added gradually, first those that require 
the longest time to cook. Use whatever vegetables are 
in season — in winter, those in tins or bottles. 

In the last 5 minutes, add the pickled cucumbers, 
cut into slices. If chopped mushrooms are added, they 
also must only stew 5 minutes. 

The appearance of the dish is improved if some of the 
vegetables are cooked separately in water with salt. 

To serve, cut the meat into slices ; place them close 
together again, lay the vegetables round in little heaps, 
and pour over the sauce. Then place the vegetables,

butter and sugar, add half a pint of the water in which 
the ham has been boiled, a drop or two of lemon juice 
and a teaspoonful of Meat Extract, and stew the onions 
in it till brown, the sauce being just sufficient to cover

the ham in a baking-pan. Pour over it some of the brown 
sauce (in the making of which, water in which the ham 
has been boiled and Meat Extract are employed) and 
some of the wine and place in a very hot oven. Add the 
remaining sauce and wine gradually and baste the ham 
with it frequently so that it receives a brown glazing. 
Finally, stir the red currant jelly into the sauce in which 
the onions were stewed, flavour with cayenne and add 
to the Burgundy sauce.

pieces of paper (about 4 inches square), dip them into 
the boiling fat, and then press out from the syringe a 
ring of paste on to each paper, joining the ends of the 
ring together, so that they do not open out again. Slide 
the papers into the fat, a few at a time. As the paste 
rings touch the fat, they come away from the paper and 
swell out. When they begin to show cracks on the 
upper side and appear a light brown, turn them and 
let the other side finish browning. On taking out, dip 
into a mixture of castor sugar and rosewater, so that 
they receive a glaze on their upper sides. To make

BOWLE. 

{Bowie.) 



The best combination for Bowie is half Rhine wine 
and half Moselle, only real Seltzer water being added. 
The chemically-prepared Seltzer water ruins the flavour 
of the wine. 

It is important that the Bowie should not be too sweet 
and should be quite cold. 

For Strawberry Bowie reckon % lb. wood straw- 
berries to 2 bottles of wine. For Peach Bowie, the same 
quantity of peaches, which should be peeled, stoned and 
cut into several pieces. Sprinkle both strawberries and 
peaches respectively with ]^ lb. sugar, and pour over 
them % pint of wine. Stand in a cool place for % hour, 
well covered over. Then add the remaining wine.

same way. Tinned pineapple or pineapple essence may 
be employed if the fresh fruit cannot be obtained.
