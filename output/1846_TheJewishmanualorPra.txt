EDITOR'S PREFACE. 



Among the numerous works on Culinary Science 
already in circulation, there have been none 
which aflFord the slightest insight to the Cookery 
of the Hebrew kitchen. 

Replete as many of these are with informa- 
tion on various important points, they are com- 
pletely valueless to the Jewish housekeeper, 
not only on account of prohibited articles and 
combinations being assumed to be necessary 
ingredients of nearly every dish, but from the 
entire absence of all the receipts pecuUar to 
the Jewish people. 



U EDITOR S PREFACE. 

This deficiency, which has been so frequently 
the cause of inconvenience and complaint, we 
have endeavoured in the present Uttle volume 
to supply. And in taking upon ourselves the 
responsibility of introducing it to the notice of 
our readers, we have been actuated by the hope 
that it will prove of some practical utility to 
those for whose benefit it is more particularly 
designed. 

It has been our earnest desire to simplify as 
much as possible the directions given regarding 
the rudiments of the art, and to render the 
receipts which follow, clear, easy, and concise. 
Our collection will be found to contain all the 
best receipts, hitherto bequeathed only by 
memory or manuscript, from one generation to 
another of the Jewish nation, as well as those 
which come under the denomination of plain 
English dishes; and also such French ones as 
are now in general use at all refined modem 
tables. 



EDITOR 8 PREFACE* 111 

A careful attention has been paid to accuracy 
and economy in the proportions named, and the 
receipts may be perfectly depended upon, as we 
have had the chief part of them tested in our 
own kitchen and under our own surveillance. 

All difficult and expensive modes of cookery 
have been purposely omitted, as more properly 
belonging to the province of the confectioner, 
and foreign to the intention of this little work ; 
the object of which is, to guide the young Jewish 
housekeeper in the luxury and economy of " The 
Table," on which so much of the pleasure of 
social intercourse depends. 

The various acquirements, which in the pre- 
sent day are deemed essential to female educa- 
tion, rarely leave much time or inclination for 
the humble study of household affairs; and it 
not imfrequently happens, that the mistress of 
a family understands little more concerning the 
dinner table over which she presides, than the 
graceful arrangement of the flowers which adorn 



IV EDITOR S PREFACE. 

it ; thus she is incompetent to direct her servant, 
upon whose inferior judgment and taste she is 
obliged to depend. She is continually subjected 
to impositions from her ignorance of what is 
required for the dishes she selects, while a lavish 
extravagance, or parsimonious monotony betrays 
her utter inexperience in all the minute yet 
indispensible details of elegant hospitality. 

However, there are happily so many highly 
accomplished and intellectual women, whose 
example proves the compatability of uniting the 
cultivation of talents with domestic pursuits, 
that it would be superfluous and presumptuous 
were we here to urge the propriety and im- 
portance of acquiring habits of usefulness and 
household knowledge, further than to observe 
that it is the unfailing attribute of a superior 
mind to turn its attention occasionally to the 
lesser objects of life, aware how greatly they 
contribute to its harmony and its happiness. 

The Cuisine of a woman of refinement, like - 



editor's preface. V 

her dress or her furniture, is distinguished, not 
for its costliness and profusion, but for a pervad- 
ing air of graceful originality. She is quite 
sensible of the regard due to the reigning 
fashion of the day, but her own tasteful discri- 
mination is always perceptible. She instinctively 
avoids every thing that is hackneyed, vulgar, 
and common place, and uniformly succeeds in 
pleasing by the judicious novelties she intro- 
duces. 

We hope, therefore, that this unpretending 
little work may not prove wholly unacceptable, 
even to those ladies who are not of the Hebrew 
persuasion, as it will serve as a sequel to the 
books on cookery previously in their possession, 
and be the medium of presenting them with 
numerous receipts for rare and exquisite com- 
positions, which if uncommemorated by the 
genius of Vat^l, Ude, or Car^me, are delicious 
enough not only to gratify the lovers of good 



VI EDITORS PREFACE. 

cheer generally, but to merit the unqualified ap- 
probation of the most fastidious epicures. 

We ought, perhaps, to apologize for the appa- 
rent incongruity of connecting the "Toilet" 
with the " Kitchen ;" but the receipts and sug- 
gestions comprised in the Second Part of the 
work before us, will not, we trust, be considered 
misplaced in a volume addressed exclusively to 
the ladies. 

Many of the receipts are for articles in com- 
mon use, but which, with proper directions, are 
prepared with greater economy and in a 
superior manner at home; the others are all 
original receipts, many of them extremely 
ancient, and given to us by a person who can 
vouch for their eflScacy firom personal expe- 
rience and observation. 

We must now conclude our preliminary re- 
marks, but cannot take leave of our patient 
readers without avaiUng ourselves of the oppor- 



EDITORS PREFACE. VI I 

tunity our editorial capacity affords^ to express 
our hope, that with all its faults and deficiencies 
" The Jewish Manual" may prove to them a 
useful assistant, and be fortunate enough to meet 
vrith their lenient, kind, and favourable con- 
sideration.

OBSERVATIONS 



USE OF THE COOK. 



The receipts we have given are capable of 
being varied and modified by an intelligent 
pains-taking cook, to suit the tastes of her em- 
ployers. 

Where one receipt has been thought sufficient 
to convey the necessary instruction for several 
dishes, &c., &c., it has not been repeated for each 
respectively, which plan will tend to &cilitate 
her task. 



XVUl OBSERVATIONS FOR THE 

We might, had we been incUned, have in- 
creased our collection considerably by so doing, 
but have decided, from our own experience, 
that it is preferable to give a limited number 
clearly and fully explained, as these will always 
serve as guides and models for others of the same 
kind. 

The cook must remember it is not enough to 
have ascertained the ingredients and quantities 
requisite, but great care and attention must be 
paid to the manner of mixing them, and in 
watching their progress when mixed and sub- 
mitted to the fire. 

The management of the oven and the die 
deserve attention, and cannot be regulated 
properly without practice and observation. 

The art of seasoning is difficult and im- 
portant 

Great judgment is required in blending the 
different spices or other condiments, so that 
a fine flavour is produced without the undue 
preponderance of either. 



USE OF THE COOK. XIX 

It is only in coarse cooking that the flavour 
of onions, pepper, garlic, nutmeg, and eschalot 
is permitted to prevail As a general rule, salt 
should be used in moderation. 

Sugar is an improvement in nearly all soups, 
sauces, and gravies; also with stewed vege- 
tables, but of course must be used with discretion. 

Ketchups, Soy, Harvey's sauce, &c., are used 
too indiscrimately by inferior cooks ; it is better 
to leave them to be added at table by those who 
approve of their flavour. 

Any thing that is required to be warmed up 
a second time, should be set in a basin placed 
in a bain-marie, or saucepan, filled with boiUng 
water, but which must not be allowed to boil ; 
or the article will become hardened and the 
sauce dried up. 

To remove every particle of fat from the 
gravies of stews, &c., a piece of white blotting- 
paper should be laid on the surface, and the fat 
will adhere to it; this should be repeated two 
or three times. 



XX OBSERVATIONS FOE THE 

It is important to keep saucepans well 
skimmed ; the best prepared dish will be spoiled 
by neglect on this point 

The difference between good and bad cook- 
ery is particularly discernible in the preparation 
of forcemeats. A common cook is satistified if 
she chops or minces the ingredients and 
moistens them with an egg scarcely beaten, 
but this is a very crude and imperfect method ; 
they should be pounded together in a mortar 
until not a lump or fibre is perceptible. Fur- 
ther directions will be given in the proper place, 
but this is a rule which must be strictly attended 
to by those who wish to attain any excellence 
in this branch of their art. 

Eggs for forcemeats, and for every description 
of sweet dishes, should be thoroughly beaten, 
and for the finer kinds should be passed through 
a sieve. 

A trustworthy zealous servant must keep in 
mind, that waste and extravagance are no proofe 
of skill. On the contrary. Good Cookery is 



USE OF THE COOK. XXI 

by no means expensive, as it makes the most of 
every thing, and furnishes out of simple and 
economical materials, dishes TPvhich are at once 
palatable and elegant. 



CHAPTER I. 

STOCK OR CONSOMME* 

This is the basis of all kinds of soup and sauces. 
Shin of beef or ox-cheek make excellent stock, 
although good gravy-beef is sometimes preferred; 
the bones should always be broken, and the meat 
cut up, as the juices are better extracted; it is 
advisable to put on, at first, but very little water, 
and to add more when the first quantity is nearly 
dried up. The time required for boiling depends 
upon the quantity of meat; six pounds of meat 
will take about five hours; if bones, the same 
quantity will require double the time. 

Gravy beef with a knuckle of veal makes a 
fine and nutritious stock; the stock for white 
soups should be prepared with veal or white 



2 ON SOUPS. 

poultry. Very tolerable stock can be procured 
without purchasing meat expressly for the pur- 
pose, by boiling down bones and the trimmings 
of meat or poultry. 

The liquor in which beef or mutton intended 
for the table has been boiled, will also, with 
small additions and skilful flavoring, make an 
excellent soup at a trifling expense. 

To thicken soups, mix a little potatoe-flour, 
ground rice, or pounded vermicelli, in a little 
water, till perfectly smooth; add a little of the 
soup to it in a cup, until sufficiently thin, then 
pour it into the rest and boil it up, to prevent 
the raw taste it would otherwise have ; the pre- 
sence of the above ingredients should not be 
discovered, and judgment and care are therefore 
requisite. 

If colouring is necessary, a crust of bread 
stewed in the stock will give a fine brown, or 
the common browning may be used ; it is made 
in the following manner: 

Put one pound of coarse brown sugar in a 
stew-pan with a lump of clarified suet ; when 
it begins to froth, pour in a wine-glass of port 
wine, half an ounce of black pepper, a little 
mace, four spoonsfiil of ketchup or Harvey's 



ON SOUPS. 3 

sauce^ a little salt, and the peel of a lemon 
grated; boil all together, let it grow cold, when 
it must be skimmed and bottled for use. 

It may also be prepared as required, by 
putting a small piece of clarified fat with one 
ounce of coarse sugar, in an iron spoon, melting 
them together, and stirring in a little ketchup 
and pepper. 

When good stock or consonmi^ is prepared, 
it is very easy to form it into any kind of soup 
or sauce that may be required. 



GRAVY SOUP. 

Take about three quarts of any strong stock, 
seasoned with a bimch of sweet herbs, a carrot, 
turnip, and a head of celery, which must not 
be served in the soup. Vermicelli, maccaroni, 
or thin slices of carrot and small sippets of 
fried bread cut in fancy shapes, are usually 
served in this soup. 



MOCK TURTLE. 

Half boil a well-cleaned calf s head, then 
cut off all the meat in small square pieces, and 



4 ON SOUPS, 

break the bones; return it to the stew-pan, 
with some good stock made of beef and veal ; 
dredge in flour, add fried shalot, pepper, parsley, 
tarragon, a little mushroom ketchup, and a 
pint of white wine ; simmer gently until the 
meat is perfectly soft and tender. Balls of 
force-meat, and egg-balls, should be put in a 
short time before serving ; the juice of a lemon 
is considered an improvement 



MULIGATAWNY SOUP. 

Take two chickens, cut them up small, as if 
for fricassee, flour them weU, put them in a 
saucepan with four onions shred, a piece of 
clarified fat, pepper, salt, and two table spoons- 
ful of curry powder; let it simmer for an hoiur, 
then add three quarts of strong beef gravy, 
and let it continue simmering for another hour ; 
before sent to table the juice of a lemon should 
be stirred in it; some persons approve of a little 
rice being boiled with the stock, and a pinch 
of saffiron is also sometimes added. 



ON SOUPS. 5 

ENGLISH MULIGATAWNY. 

Take a knuckle of Teal^ stew it till half done^ 
then cut off the greatest part of the meat, and 
continue to stew down the bone in the stock, the 
meat must be cut into small pieces and fried with 
six onions thbily sliced, and a table spoonful of 
curry powder, a desert spoonful of cayenne pep- 
per and salt, add the stock and let the whole 
gently simmer for nearly an hour, flavouring it 
with a little Harvey's sauce and lemon pickle. 



SOUP A LA JULIENNE. 

Take a variety of vegetables: such as celery, 
carrots, turnips, leeks, cauliflower, lettuce, and 
onions, cut them in shreds of small size, place 
them in a stew-pan with a little fine salad oil, 
stew them gently over the fire, adding weak broth 
from time to time; toast a few slices of bread and 
cut them into pieces the size and shape of 
shillings and crowns, soak them in the remain- 
der of the broth, and when the vegetables are 
well done add all tc^ther and let it simmer for 
a few minutes; a lump of white sugar, with pep- 
per and salt are suflicient seasoning. 



ON SOUPS. 



SOUPE A UL TURQUE. 



Make a good gravy from shin of beef, and cut 
up very smaQ various sorts of vegetables of what- 
ever may be in season, add spices, pepper, and 
salt; when it is all stewed well down together, 
set it to cool and take off the fiit, then place it 
again on the fire to boil, and add to two quarts 
of soup, one quarter of a pound of rice, beat two 
yolks of eggs with a little of the stock, and when 
the rice is quite tender, stir them into the soup, 
taking the precaution not to let the soup boil, 
and to stir always the same way. 



PEPPER POT. 

Cut small pieces of any vegetables, and add 
pieces of smoked or salt beef, and also of any 
cold poultry, roast beef or mutton, stew all these 
tc^ether in two or three quarts of water, accord- 
ing to the quantity of meat, &c It must be 
seasoned highly with whole peppers, allspice, 
mace, Jamaica pickles, and salt ; it must be 
thoroughly stewed, and served, without strain- 
ing, in a tureen. 



ON SOUPS. 7 

POTATOE SOUP. 

Grate a pound of fine potatoes in two quarts 
of water, add to it the trimmings of any meat, 
amounting to about a poimd in quantity, a cup 
of rice, a few sweet herbs, and a head of celery, 
stew well till the liquor is considerably reduced, 
then strain it through a sieve ; if, when strained, 
it is too thin and watery, add a little thickening ; 
it should be flavoured only with white pepper 
and salt 



SOUP CRESSY. 

Grate six carrots, and chop some onions with 
a lettuce, adding a few sweet herbs, put them all 
into a stewpan, with enough of good broth to 
moisten the whole, adding occasionally the 
remainder ; when nearly done, put in the crumb 
of a French roll, and when soaked, strain the 
whole through a sieve, and serve hot in a 
tureen. 



CARROT soup. 

Take a dozen carrots scraped clean, rasp them, 
but do not use the core, two heads of celery, two 



8 ON SOUPS, 

onions thinly sliced^ season to taste, and pour 
over a good stock, say about two quarts, boil it, 
then pass it through a sieve ; it should be of the 
thickness of cream, return it to the saucepan, 
boil it up and squeeze in a little lemon juice, or 
add a little vinegar. 



PALESTINE SOUP. 

Stew a knuckle of veal, and a calfs foot, and 
one pound of chonssa, and a large fowl, in foiur 
quarts of water, add a piece of fresh lemon peel, 
six Jerusalem artichokes, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
a little salt and white pepper, and a little nut- 
meg, and a blade of mace ; when the fowl is 
thoroughly done, remove the white parts to pre- 
pare for thickening, and let the rest continue 
stewing till the stock is sufficiently strong, the 
white parts of the fowl must be pounded and 
sprinkled with flower or ground rice, and stirred 
in the soup after it has been strained, until it 
thickens. 



ON SOUPS. 9 

A SIMPLE WHITE SOUP. 

Break a knuckle of veal^ place it in a stewpan^ 
also a piece of cfiarissa, a carroty two onions^ 
three or four turnips^ and a blade of mace^ poiur 
over two or three quarts of water or weak broth, 
season with salt, a sprig of parsley, and whole 
white pepper ; when sufficiently boiled, skim and 
strain it, and thicken with pounded vermicellL 



VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Make a fine strong stock from the shin of 
beel^ or any other part preferred, and add, a short 
time before serving, a handfiil of vermicelli, 
which should be broken, so that it may be in 
pieces of convenient length, the stock should 
be more or less flavoured with vegetables, and 
herbs, according to taste.

stew gently for eight hours, then stram and 
let it stand to get cold, when the fat must be 
removed, then return it to the saucepan to warm 
up. Ten minutes before serving, throw in the 
balls, from which the soup takes its name, and 
which are made in the following manner : 

Take half a pound of matso flour, two ounces 
of chopped suet, season with a little pepper, 
salt, ginger, and nutmeg; mix with this, four 
beaten eggs, and make it into a paste, a small 
onion shred and browned in a desert spoonful 
of oil is sometimes added ; the paste should be 
made into rather large balls, and care should 
be taken to make them very light 



TOMATA SOUP.

sweet almonds blanched and beaten with a spoon- 
ful of powdered white sugar. This mixture is 
to be stirred into the soup till it thickens, 
taking care to prevent its curdling. 



A FINE VEGETABLE OR FRENCH SOUP. 

Take two quarts of strong stock made of gravy 
beef, add to this, carrots, turnips, leek, celery, 
brocoli, peas and French beans, all cut as small 
as possible, add a few lumps of white sugar, pep-

balls. 



ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

Take eight pounds of gravy beef, with five 
pints of water, a few sweet herbs, and an onion 
shred, with a little pepper and salt ; when the 
strength of the meat is sufficiently extracted, 
strain off the soup, and add to it a bundle of 
asparagus, cut small, with a little chopped pars- 
ley and mint; the asparagus should be tho- 
roughly done. A few minutes before serving, 
throw in some filed bread cut up the size of dice ; 
pound a little spinach to a pulp, and squeeze 
it through a cloth, stir about a tearcup fiill of 
this essence into the soup, let it boil up after 
to prevent a raw taste. 



SOUP MAIGRB. 

Chop three lettuces, a large handfiil of spin- 
ach, a little chervil, a head of celery, two or 
three carrots, and four onions, put them on the 
fire with half a pound of butter, and let them

ON SOUPS. 13 

salt, sifted white sugar, and white pepper, stew 
all gently in five pints of boiling water for 
about two hours and a half, and just before 
serving the soup, thicken it with the beaten yolks 
of four eggs, mixed first with a little of the soup, 
and then stirred into the remainder. 



SUMMER PEA SOUP. 

Take a peck of peas, separate the old firom 
the young, boil the former till they are quite 
tender in good stock, then pass them through 
a sieve, and return them to the stock, add the 
young peas, a little chopped lettuce, small pieces 
of cucumber firied to a light brown, a little 
bit of mint, pepper, and salt; two or three 
lumps of sugar give a fine flavor. 



WINTER PEA SOUP. 

Soak a quart of white peas in water, boil 
them till soft, in as much water as will cover 
them, pass them through a sieve, and add them 
to any broth that may be ready, a Uttle piece 
of clwrissa or smoked beef will improve the 



14 ON SOUPS. 

flavour ; this soup should be served with mint and 
fried bread. 



6IBLET SOUP. 

Add to a fine strong wcll-seasoned beef stock, 
of about three quarts^ two sets of giblets, which 
should be previously stewed separately in one 
quart of water (the gizzards require scalding for 
some time before they are put in with the rest) ; 
white pepper, salt, and the rind of lemon should 
season them ; when they are tender, add them 
with their gravy to the stock, and boil for about 
ten minutes together, then stir in a glass of white 
wine, a table spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and 
the juice of half a lemon ; it will require to be 
thickened with a little flour browned; the gib- 
lets are served in the soup. 



BARLEY soup. 

Put in a stew-pan, a knuckle of mutton, or 
four pounds of the neck, with three quarts of 
water, boil it gently and keep it well skimmed ; 
a sprig of parsley, a couple of sliced turnips, a 
carrot, an onion or more, if approved, with a little 



ON aoups. 15 

white pepper and salt, are sufficient seasonings 
a breakfast cup full of barley should be scalded 
and put in the stew-pan with the meat, if when 
done, the soup is thin and watery, a little 
prepared barley, mixed smoothly, should be 
stirred in. 



SOUP DB POISSON, OR FISH SOUP. 

Make a good stock, by simmering a cod's-head 
in water, enough to cover the fish ; season it 
with pepper and salt, mace, celery, parsley, and 
a few sweet herbs, with two or three onions, 
when sufficiently done, strain it, and add cutlets 
of fish prepared in the following manner: cut 
very small, well-trimmed cutlets from any fish, 
sole or brill are perhaps best suited ; stew thepi 
in equal quantities of water and wine, but not 
more than will cover them, with a large lump of 
butter, and the juice of a lemon ; when they have 
stewed gently for about fifteen or twenty mi- 
nutes, add them to the soup, which thicken with 
cream and flour, serve the soup with the cutlets 
in a tureen ; force-meat balls of cod's liver are 
sometimes added 



16 ON SOUPS. 

ox TAIL SOUP. 

Have two well cleaned tails and a neat's foot, 
cut them in small joints and soak them in water, 
put them in a stew-pan with a large piece of 
clarified suet or fat, and let them simmer for ten 
minutes, then put to them between three and 
four quarts of cold water, four onions, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, a carrot, a turnip, a head of 
celery, and season with whole pepper, allspice, 
two or three cloves, and salt ; let it stew till the 
meat is tender enough to leave the bones, then 
remove it from them, as the bones are unsightly 
in the soup; thicken if necessary with browned 
flour, and just before serving, add a glass or 
more of port wine, and a little mushroom 
ketchup.

CHAPTER II. 



A RICH BROWN GRAVY. 

Take a little good beef consomm6, or stock, 
a small piece of smoked beef, or charissa, a lemon 
sliced, some chopped shalots, a couple of onions 
shred, a bay leaf, two or three cloves, and a 
little oil; simmer gently, and add a little 
minced parsley, and a few chopped mushrooms : 
skim and strain. 



SAUCE PIQUANTE. 

The above may be rendered a Sauce Piquante 
by substituting a little vinegar, whole capers, 
allspice, and thyme, instead of the smoked beef 



18 SAUCES. 

and lemon ; a few onions and piccalilli chopped 
finely, is a great addition when required to be 
very piquante. 

A sauce like the above is very good to serve 
with beef that has been boiled for broth. 



A GOOD GRAVY FOR ROAST FOWLS. 

Take a little stock, squeeze in the juice of 
a lemon, add a little mushroom powder, cayenne 
pepper and salt ; thicken with flour. 

ANOTHER EXCELLENT RECEIPT. 

Chop some mushrooms, young and fi:esh, salt 
them, and put them into a saucepan with a 
little gravy, made of the trimmings of the fowl, 
or of veal, a blade of mace, a little grated lemon 
peel, the juice of one lemon ; thicken with flour, 
and when ready to serve, stir in a table-spoonful

of a fine lemon, a tea-spoouful of flour, and a 



SAUCES. 19 

little cold water^ mix well together^ and set it 
on the fire to thicken, stirring it to prevent 
curdling. This sauce will be found excellent, 
if not superior, in many cases where English 
cooks use melted butter. K capers are substi- 
tuted for the lemon juice, this sauce will be 
found excellent for boiled lamb or nyitton. 



CELERY SAUCE. 

Cut in small pieces fi'om about four to five 
heads of celery, which if not very young must 
be peeled, simmer it till tender in half a pint of 
veal gravy, if intended for white sauce, then 
add a spoonful of flour, the yolks of three eggs, 
white pepper, salt, and the juice of one lemon, 
these should be previously mixed together with 
a little water till perfectly smooth and thin, 
and be stirred in with the sauce ; cream, instead 
of eggs, is used in English kitchens. 



TOMATO SAUCE. 

Skin a dozen fine tomatos, set them on the 
fire in a little water or gravy, beat them up with 



20 SAUCES. 

a litde vinegar, lemon juice, cayenne pepper,

Take the feet, wash them, cut them small, 
also the neck and gizzard; season them with 
pepper and salt, onion, and parsley, let them sim- 
mer gently for some time, in about a breakfast* 
cup of water, then strain, thicken with flour, 
and add a little browning, and if liked, a small 
quantity of any store sauce at hand, and it will 
prove an excellent sauce. 



SAVOURY JELLY, 
FOR COLD PIES, OR TO GARNISH COLD POULTRY. 

Have a bare knuckle of veal, and a calf s foot 
or cow heel ; put it into a stew-pan with a thick 
slice of smoked beef, a few herbs, a blade of 
mace, two or three onions, a little lemon peel, 
pepper and salt, and three or four pints of 



SAUCES. 21 

water (the French add a litde tan-agon vine- 
gar). When it boils skim it, and when cold, if 
not clear, boil it a few minutes with the white 
and shell of an egg, and pass it through a jelly 
bag, this jelly with the juice of two or three 
lemons, and poured into a mould, in which are 
put the yolks of eggs boiled hard, forms a pretty 
supper dish. 



A riNB SAUCE FOK STEAKS. 

Throw into a saucepan a piece of fat the size 
of an egg, with two or three onions sliced, let 
them brown; add a little gravy, flour, a little 
vinegar, a E^onfol of mustard, and a little 
cayenne pepper, boil it and serve with the 
steaks. 



A FISH SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER. 

Put on, in a small saucepan^ a cup of water, 
well flavored with vinegar, an onion chopped 
fine, a little rasped horse-radish, pepper, and 
two or three cloves, and a couple of anchovies

One teacup full of walnut pickle^ the same of 
mushroom ditto^ three anchovies pounded, one 
clove of garlic pounded, half a tea-spoonful of 
cayenne pepper, all mixed well together, and 
bottled for use. 

A NICE SAUCE TO THROW OVER BROILED MEATS. 

Beat up a little salad-oil with a table-Â«poonfol 
of vinegar, mustard, pepper and salt, and then 
stir in the yolk of an ^g ; this sauce should be 
highly seasoned. A sauce of this description 
is sometimes used to baste mutton while roast- 
ing, the meat should be scored in different 
places to allow the sauce to penetrate. 

SAUCE FOR DUCKS. 

A little good gravy, with a glass of port wine, 
the juice of a lemon, highly seasoned with 
cayenne pepper. 

BREAD SAUCE. 

Take a large onion and boil it, with a little 
pepper till quite soft, in milk, then take it out.

and pour the milk over grated stale bread, then 
boil it up with a piece of butter, and dredge it 
with flour ; it should be well beaten up with a

The above can be made without butter or 
milk: take a large oiiion, slice it thin, put it 
into a little veal gravy, add grated bread, pep- 
per, &c., and the yolk and white of an egg well 
beaten. 



APPLE SAUCE FOR GOOSE. 

Slice some apples, put them in a Uttle water 
to simmer till soft, beat them to a pulp ; some 
consider a Uttle powdered sugar an improve- 
ment, but as the acid of the apples is reckoned 
a corrective to the richness of the goose, it is 
usually preferred without 



MINT SAUCE. 

Mix vinegar with brown sugar, let it stand 
about an hour, then add chopped mint, and stir 
tc^ether. 

ONION SAUCE. 

Slice finely, and brown in a little oil, two or 
three onions; put them in a Uttle beef gravy. 



24 sAucPis. 

and add cayenne pepper, salt, and the juice of 
a lemon. This is a nice sauce for steaks. 



OILED BUTTER. 

Put some good butter into a cup or jar, and 
place it before the fire till it becomes an oil, then 
poor it off, so that all sediment may be avoided. 



TO DRAW GOOD GRAVY. 

Cut some gravy beef into small pieces, put 
them in a jar, and set it in a saucepan of cold 
water to boil gently for seven or eight hours, 
adding, firom time to time, more water as the 
original quantity boils away. The gravy thus 
made will be the essence of the meat, and in 
cases where nutriment is required in the smallest 
compass, will be of great service. Soups are 
stronger when the meat is cut, and gravy drawn 
before water is added. 

TRUFFLE SAUCE. 

Peel and slice as many truffles as required, 
simmer them gently with a little butter, when 
they axe tender^ add to them good white or 



SAUCES. 25 

brown consomm^^ lemon juice^ pepper^ saltÂ»

MUSHROOM SAUCE. 

Take about a pint of fine young button 
mushrooms, let them stew gently in a white 
veal gravy seasoned with salt, pepper, a blade of 
mace, and if approved, the grated peel of half 
a lemon, it should be thickened with flour 
and the yolk of an egg stirred in it, just 
before serving; English cooks add cream to 
this sauce. 



SWEET SAUCE. 

The usual way of making sauces for puddings, 
is by adding sugar to melted butter, or thin 
egg sauce, flavoring it with white wine, brandy, 
lemon peel, or any other flavor approved of. 



MEf.TED BUTTER. 

Although this sauce is one of the most sim- 
ple, it is very rarely that it is well made. Mix 
with four ounces of butter, a desert spoonful of 



26 SAUCES. 

flour, when well mixed, add three table spoons- 
fill of water, put it into a clean saucepan kept 
for the purpose, and stir it carefiiUy one way 
till it boils; white sauce to throw over vegeta- 
bles served on toast, is made in the same way, 
only putting milk and water, instead of water 
only. 



SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER FOR BOILED 
PUDDINGS. 

Mix a table-spoonfiil of flour, with two of 
water, add a little wine, lemon peel grated, a 
small bit of clarified suet, of the size of a wal- 
nut, grated nutmeg, and sugar, put on in a 
saucepan, stirring one way, and adding water if 
too thick, lemon juice, or essence of noyeau, 
or almonds may be substituted to vary the 
flavour. 



SAUCE ROBERT FOR STEAKS. 

Chop up some onions, throw them into a 
saucepan with a bit of clarified fat, let them fi:y 
till brown, then add pepper, salt, a little gravy, 
mustard, lemon juice, and vinegar; boil it all, 
and pour over the steaks.

CAPER SAUCE. 

This is merely melted butter with a few 
pickled capers simmered in it, or they may be 
put into a sauce made of broth thickened with 
egg, and a little flour. 



SAVORY HERB POWDER. 

It is useful to select a variety of herbs, so that 
they may always be at hand for use : the fol- 
lowing are considered to be an excellent selec- 
tion, parsley, savory, thyme, sweet majoram, 
shalot, chervil, and sage, in equal quantities; dry 
these in the oven, pound them finely and keep 
them in bottles well stopped. 



SEASONING FOR DTJCKS AND GEESE. 

Mix chopped onion with an equal quantity of 
chopped sage, three times as much grated stale 
bread, a little shred suet, pepper, salt, and a 
beaten egg to bind it, this is generally used for 
geese and ducks, the onions are sometimes 
boiled first to render them less strong. 



28 &A.UCES. 

ENGLISH EGG SAUCE. 

Boil two eggs hard^ chop them finely^ and 
warm them up in finely made melted butter^ 
add a little white pepper, salt, a blade of mace, 
and a very small quantity of nutmeg. 



SAUCE A LA TARTARE. 

Mix the yolk of an egg with oil, vinegar, 
chopped parsley, mustard, pepper, and salt ; a 
spoonful of pat6 de diable or French mustard, 
renders the sauce more piquante. 



A FINE SAUCE FOR ROAST MUTTON. 

Mix a little port wine in some gravy, two 
table-spoonfuls of vinegar, one of oil, a shalot 
minced, and a spoonful of mustard, just before 
the mutton is served, pour the sauce over it, 
then sprinkle it with fried bread crumbs, and 
then again baste the meat with the sauce; this is 
a fine addition to the mutton. 



ASPARAGUS SAUCE, TO SERVE WITH LAMB 
CHOPS. 

Cut some asparagus, or sprew, into half inch 
lengths, wash them, and throw them into half a 



SAUCES. 29 

pint of gravy made from beef, veal, or mut- 
ton thickened, and seasoned with salt, white 
pepper, and a lump of white sugar, the chops 
should be delicately fried and the sauce served 
in the centre of the dish. 



BROWN CUCUMBER SAUCE. 

Peel and cut in thick slices, one or more fresh 
cucumbers, fry them until brown in a little but- 
ter, or clarified fat, then add to them a Uttle 
strong beef gravy, pepper, salt, and a spoonful 
of vinegar; some cooks add a chopped onion 
browned with the cucumbers. 



WHITE CI} CUMBER SAUCE. 

Take out the seeds of some fresh young 
cucumbers, quarter them, and cut them into 
pieces of two inch lengths, let them lay for 
an hour in vinegar and water, then simmer 
them till thorpughly soft, in a veal broth 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little lemon 
juice ; when ready for serving, pour off the gravy 
and thicken it with the yolks of a couple of eggs 
stirred in, add it to the saucepan ; warm up, 
taking care that it does not curdle. 



30 SAUCES. 

BROWNED FLOUR FOR MAKING SOUPS AND 
GRAVIES DARK AND THICK. 

Spread flour on a tin, and place it in a Dutch 
oven before the fire, or in a gentle oven till it 
browns; it must often be turned, that the flour 
may be equally coloured throughout A small 
quantity of this prepared and laid by for use, 
will be found useful. 



BROWNED BREAD CRUMBS. 

Grate into fine crumbs, about five or six 
ounces of stale bread, and brown them in a 
gentle oven or before the fire ; this is a more 
delicate way of browning them than by filing. 



CRISPED PARSLEY. 

Wash and drain a handful of fi'esh young 
sprigs of parsley, dry them with a cloth, place 
them before the fire on a dish, turn them 
fi'equently, and they will be perfectly crisp in 
ten minutes. 



SAUCES. 31 

FRIED PARSLEY. 

When the parsley is prepared as above, fry 
it in butter or clarified suet, then drain it on a 
cloth placed before the fire. 



BREAD CRUMBS FOR FRYING. 

Cut slices of bread without crust, and dry 
them gradually in a cool oven till quite dry 
and crisp, then roll them into fine crumbs, and 
put them in a jar for use. 



SPINACH GREEN. 

Pound to a pulp in a mortar a handfiil of 
spinach, aind squeeze it through a hair sieve; 
then put it into a cup or jar, and place it in a 
basin of hot water for a few minutes, or it may 
be allowed to simmer on the fire ; a little of this 
stirred into spring soups, improve their appear- 
ance. 

VELOUTE, BECHAMEL. 

These preparations are so frequently men- 
tioned in modem cookery, that we shall give 



32 8AUCESÂ« 

the receipts for them^ although they are not 
appropriate for the Jewish kitchen. Velout^ is 
a fine white sauce, made by reducing a certain 
quantity of well-flavoiu*ed consomm^ or stock, 
over a charcoal fire, and mixing it with boiling 
cream, stirring it carefiilly till it thickens. 

B6chamel is another sort of fine white stock, 
thickened with cream, there is more flavouring in 
this than the former, the stock is made of veal, 
with some of the smoked meats used in English 
kitchens, butter, mace, onion, mushrooms, bay 
leaf, nutmeg, and a little salt An excellent 
substitute for these sauces can in Jewish kitchens 
be made in the following way : 

Take some veal broth flavored with smoked 
beef, and the above named seasonings, then 
beat up two or three yolks of eggs, with a little 
of the stock and a spoonful of potatoe flour, stir 
this into the broth, until it thickens, it will not 
be quite as white, but will be excellent. 



FORCEMEAT OR FARCIE. 

Under this head is included the various pre- 
parations used for balls, tisoles, flitters, and 



SAUCES 33 

stuffings for poultry and veal, it is a branch of 
cooking which requires great care and judg- 
ment, the proportions should be so blended as 
to produce a delicate, yet savoury flavor, without 
allowing any particular herb or spice to predo- 
minate. 

The ingredients should always be pounded 
well together in a mortar, not merely chopped 
and moistened with egg, as is usually done by 
inexperienced cooks ; forcemeat can be served 
in a variety of forms, and is so useful a resource, 
that it well repays the attention it requires. 



A SUPERIOR FORCEMEAT FOR RISOLLES^ FRITTERS, 
AND SAVORY MEAT BALLS. 

Scrape half a pound of the fat of smoked 
beef, and a pound of lean veal, free from skin, 
vein, or sinew, pound it finely in a mortar with 
chopped mushrooms, a little minced parsley, salt 
and pepper, and grated lemon peel, then have 
ready the crumb of two French rolls soaked in 
good gravy, press out the moisture, and add the 
crumb to the meat with three beaten eggs ; if 
the forcemeat is required to be very highly 



34 SAUCES. 

flavored, the gravy in which the rolls are soaked 
should be seasoned with mushroom powder ; a 
spoonful of ketchup, a bay leaf, an onion, pep- 
per, salt, and lemon juice, add this panada to the 
pounded meat and eggs, form the mixture into 
any form required, and either fry or warm in 
gravy, according to the dish for which it is 
intejaded. 

Any cold meats pounded, seasoned, and made 
according to the above method are excellent; 
the seasoning can be varied, or rendered simpler 
if required. 



COMMON VEAL STUFFING. 

Have equal quantities of finely shred suet 
and grated crumbs of bread, add chopped sweet 
herbs, grated lemon peel, pepper, and salt, 
pound it in a mortar ; this is also used for white 
poultry, with the addition of a little grated 
smoked beef, or a piece of the root of a tongue 
pounded and mixed with the above ingre- 
dients. 



SAUCES. 35 

FISH FORCEMEAT. 

Chop finely any kind of fish, that which has 
been akeady dressed will answer the purpose, 
then pound it in a mortar with a couple of an- 
chovies, or a little anchovy ^essence, the yolk of 
a hard boiled egg, a little butter, parsley or any 
other herb which may be approved, grated 
lemon peel, and a little of the juice, then add a 
little bread previously soaked, and mix the 
whole into a paste, and form into balls, or use 
for stuffing, &c. 

The liver or roe of fish is well suited to add 
to the fish, as it is rich and delicate. 



FORCEMEAT FOR DRESSING FISH FILLETS. 

Pound finely anchovies, grated bread, chopped 
parsley, and the yolk of a hard boiled egg, add 
grated lemon peel, a little lemon juice, pepper 
and salt, and make into a paste with two eggs. 



FORCEMEAT FOR DRESSING CUTLETS, ETC. 

Add to grated stale bread, an equal quantity 
of chopped parsley, season it well, and mix. it 



36 SAUCES. 

with clarified suet, then brush the cutlets with 
beaten yolks of ef^, lay on the mixture thickly 
with a knife, and sprinkle over with dry and fine 
bread crumbs. 



EGG BAL. L S. 

Beat the hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, 
make it into a paste with the yolk of a raw egg, 
form the paste into very small balls, and throw 
them into boiling water for a minute or so, to 
harden them. 



PREPARATION FOR CUTLETS OF FOWL OR VEAL. 

Make a smooth batter of flour, and a little 
salad oil, and two eggs, a little white pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, turn the cutlets well in this 
mixture, and fiy a light brown, garnish with 
slices of lemon, and crisped parsley, this is done 
by putting in the parsley after the cutlets have 
been fiied, it will speedily crisp; it should 
then be drained, to prevent its being greasy.

CHAPTER III. 



PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 
When fish is to be boiled^ it should be rubbed 
lightly over with salt, and set on the fire in a 
saucepan or fish-kettle sufficiently large, in hard 
cold water, with a little salt, a spoonful or two 
of vinegar is sometimes added, which has the 
efiect of increasing its firmness. 

Fish for broiling should be rubbed over with 
vinegar, well dried in a cloth and floured. The 
fire must be clear and firee firom smoke, the grid- 
iron made quite hot, and the bars buttered before 
the fish is put on it Fish to be filed should be 
rubbed in with salt, dried, rolled in a cloth, and 
placed for a few minutes before the fire previous 
to being put in the pan. 



38 FISH. 

FISH FRIED IN OIL. 

Soles, plaice, or salmon, are the best kinds of 
fish to dress in this manner, although various 
other sorts are firequently used. When prepared 
by salting or drying, as above directed, have a 
dish ready with beaten eggs, turn the fish well 
over in them, and sprinkle it fireely with flour, 
so that the fish may be covered entirely with it, 
then place it in a pan with a good quantity of 
the best firying oil at boiling heat ; try the fish 
in it gently, till of a fine equal brown colour, 
when done, it should be placed on a cloth before 
tlie fire for the oil to drain ofi*; great care should 
be observed that the oil should have ceased to 
bubble when the fish is put in, otherwise it will 
be greasy ; the oil will serve for two or three 
times if strained off and poured into a jar. Fish 
prepared in this way is usually served cold. 



FRIED SOLES IN THE ENGLISH WAY. 

Prepare the soles as directed in the last re- 
ceipt, brush them over with egg, dredge them 
with stale bread crumbs, and firy in boiling 



FISH. 39 

butter ; this method is preferable when required 
to be served hot 



ESCOBECHE. 

Take some cold fried fish, place it in a deep 
pan, then boil half a pint of vinegar with two 
table spoonsful of water, and one of oil, a little 
grated ginger, allspice, cayenne pepper, two bay 
leaves, a little salt, and a table spoonful of lemon 
juice, vnth sliced onions ; when boiling, pour it 
over the fish, cover the pan, and let it stand 
twenty-four hours before serving. 



FISH STEWED WHITE. 

Put an onion, finely chopped, into a stew-pan, 
vnih a little oil, till the onion becomes brown, 
then add half a pint of water, and place the fish 
in the stew-pan, seasoning with pepper, salt, 
mace, groimd allspice, nutmeg, and ginger ; let 
it stew gently till the fish is done, then prepare 
the beaten yolks of four eggs, with the juice of 
two lemons, and a tea spoonful of flour, a table 
spoonful of cold water, and a little saffron, mix 
well in a cup, and pour it into the stew-pan. 



40 FISH. 

Stirring it carefully one way until it thickens. 
Balls should be thrown in about twenty minutes 
before serving ; they are made in the following 
way : take a little of the fish, the liver, and roe, 
if there is any, beat it up finely with chopped 
parsley, and spread warmed butter, crumbs of 
bread, and seasoning according to taste ; form 
this into a paste with eggs, and make it into balls 
of a moderate size ; this is a very nice dish when 
cold ; garnish with sliced lemon and parsley. 



AN EXCELLENT RECEIPT FOR STEWED FISH 
IN THE DUTCH FASHION. 

Take three or four parsley roots, cut them 
into pieces, sUce several onions and boil in a 
pint of water till tender, season vrith lemon 
juice, vinegar, safiron, pepper, salt, and mace, 
then add the fish, and let it stew till nearly 
finished, when remove it, and thicken the gravy 
with a Uttle flour and butter, and the yolk of 
one egg, then return the fish to the stew-pan, 
with balls made as directed in the preceding 
receipt, and boil up. 



FISH. 41 

FISH STEWED BROWN. 

Fry some fish of a light brown, either soles^ 
slices of salmon, halibut, or plaice, let an onion 
brown in a little oil, add to it a cup of water, a 
little mushroom ketchup or powder, cayenne 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and lemon juice, put the 
fish into a stew-pan with the above mixture^ and 
simmer gently till done, then take out the fish 
and thicken the gravy with a little browned 
flour, and stir in a glass of port wine ; a few 
truffles, or mushrooms, are an improvement. 



WATER 80UCHY. 

Take a portion of the fish intended to be 
dressed, and stew it down with three pints of 
water, parsley roots, and chopped parsley, and 
then pulp them through a sieve, then add the 
rest of the fish, with pepper, salt, and seasoning ; 
and serve in a deep dish. 



A SUPERIOR RECEIPT FOR STEWED CARP. 

Clean the fish thoroughly, put it into a sauce- 
pan, with a strong rich gravy, season with onion, 



42 FISH. 

parsley roots, allspice, nutm^s, beaten cloves, 
and ginger, let it stew Tery gently till neariy 
done, then mix port wine and vin^ar in equal 
quantities, coarse brown sugar and lemon juice, 
a little flour, with some of the gravy from the 
saucepan, mix well and pour over the fish, let it 
boil till the gravy thickens. Pike is excellent 
stewed in this manner. 



FILLETS OF FISH. 

Fillets of salmon, soles, &c, filed of a delicate 
brown according to the' receipt already given, 
and served with a fine gravy is a very nice 
dish. 

K required to be very savory, make a fish 
force-meat, and lay it thickly on the fish before 
flying ; fillets dressed in this way are usually 
arranged round the dish, and served with a sauce 
made of good stock, thickened and seasoned 
with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and mush- 
room essence ; piccalilli are sometimes added 
cut small. 



FISH. 43 

BAKED HADDOCK. 

Carefully clean a fresh haddock, and fill it with 
a fine forcemeat, and sew it in securely; give 
the fish a dredging of flour, and pour on warmed 
butter, sprinkle it with pepper and salt, and set 
it to bake in a Dutch-oven before the fire, basting 
it, from time to time, with butter warmed, and 
capers ; it should be of a rich dark brown, and 
it is as well to dredge two or three times with 
flour while at the fire, the continual bastings will 
produce sufficient sauce to serve with it without 
any other being added. 

Mackarel and whiting prepared in this man- 
ner are excellent, the latter should be covered 
with a layer of bread crumbs, and arranged in a 
ring, and the forcemeat, instead of stuffing them, 
should be formed into small balls, and served in 
the dish as a garnish. 

The forcemeat must be made as for veal 
stuffing, with the addition of a couple of minced 
anchovies, cayenne pepper, and butter instead 
of suet 

A NICE WAY OF DRESSING RED HERRINGS. 

Open them, cut ofi* the tails and heads, soak 
them in hot water for an hour, then wipe them 



44 FISH. 

dry ; mix with warmed butter one beaten egg, 
pour this over the herrings, sprinkle with bread 
crumbs, flour, and white pepper, broil them and 
serve them very hot 



BAKED MACKAREL WITH VINEGAR. 

Cut off the heads and tails, open and clean 
them, lay them in a deep pan with a few bay 
leaves, whole pepper, half a tea-^poonM of 
cloves, and a whole spoonful of allspice, pour over 
equal quantities of vinegar and water, and bake 
for an hour and a half, in a gentle oven ; 
herrings and sprats are also dressed according 
to this receipt 

FISH SALAD. 

Cut in small pieces any cold dressed fish, tur- 
bot or salmon are the best suited ; mix it with 
half a pint of small salad, and a lettuce cut 
small, two onions boiled till tender and mild, 
and a few truffles thinly sliced ; pour over a fine 
salad mixture, and arrange it into a shape, high 
in the centre, and garnish with hard eggs cut in 
sUces ; a Httle cucumber mixed with the salad is 
an improvement The mixture may either be a 



FISH. 45 

common salad mixture, or made as follows : take 
the yolks of three hard boiled e^s, with a 
spoonful of mustard, and a little salt, mix these 
with a cup of cream, and four table-spoonsfiil 
of vinegar, the different ingredients should be 
added carefully and worked together smoothly, 
the whites of the eggs may be trimmed and 
placed in small heaps round the dish as a 
garnish. 



IMPANADA. 

Cut in small pieces halibut, plaice, or soles, 
place them in a deep dish in alternate layers, 
with slices of potatoes and dumplings made of 
short-crust paste, sweetened with brown sugar, 
season well with small pickles, peppers, gerkins, 
or West India pickles ; throw over a little 
water and butter warmed, and bake it tho- 
roughly. 



WH ITE B AI T. 

This is such a delicate fish that there are few 
cooks who attempt to dress it without spoiling it ; 
they should not be touched but thrown fix)m the 



46 FI8U. 

dish into a cloth with a handful of flour; shake 
them lightly, but enough to cover them well 
with the flour, then turn them into a sieve 
expressly for bait to free them from too great 
a quantity of tLe flour, then throw the fish into 
a pan with plenty of boiling butter, they must 
remain but an instant, for they are considered 
spoilt if they become the least brown; they 
should be placed lightly on the dish piled up 
high in the centre, brown bread and butter is 
always served with them ; when devilled they 
are also excellent, and are permitted to be- 
come brown; they are then sprinkled with 
cayenne pepper, and a little salt, and served 
with lemon juice. 

This receipt was given by a cook who dressed 
white bait to perfection. 



A DUTCH FRICANDELLE. 

Take two pounds of dressed fish, remove the 
skin and bones, cut in small pieces with two or 
three anchovies, and season well, soak the crumb 
of a French roll in milk, beat it up with the 
fish and three eggs: butter a mould, sprinkle 



FISH. 47 

it with raspings^ place in the fish and bake it ; 
when done, turn out and serve either dry or 
with anchovy sauce ; if served dry, finely grated 
crumbs of bread should be sprinkled thickly 
over it, and it should be placed for a few 
minutes before the fire to brown. 



FISH FRITTERS. 

Make a force-meat of any cold fish, form 
it into thin cakes, and firy of a light brown, or 
enclose them first in thin paste and then fry 
them. The roes of fish or the livers are parti- 
cularly nice prepared in this way. 



FISH OMELET. 

Shred finely any cold fish, season it, and mix 
with beaten eggs ; make it into a paste, fiy in 
thin cakes Hke pancakes, and serve hot on a 
napkin; there should be plenty of boiling 
butter in the pan, as they should be moist and 
rich ; there should be more eggs in the prepa- 
ration for omelets than for fritters. 



48 FISH. 

SCALLOPED FISH. 

Take any dressed fish, break it in small pieces, 
put it into tin scallops, with a few crumbs of 
bread, a good piece of butter, a little cream if 
approved, white pepper, salt, and nutmeg; bake 
in an oven for ten minutes, or brown before the 
fire; two or three mushrooms mixed, or an 
anchovy will be found an improvement. 



ANOTHER WAY. 

Break the fish into pieces, pour over the 
beaten yolk of an egg, sprinkle with pepper and 
salt, strew with bread crumbs, chopped parsley, 
and grated lemon peel, and squeeze in the juice 
of lemon, drop over a little warmed butter, and 
brown before the fire.

CHAPTER IV. 

DIRECTIONS FOE VAEIOUS WA.Y8 OF DRESSING 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 
Boiling is the most simple manner of cooking, 
the great art in this process is to boil the article 
sufficiently, without its being overdone, the 
necessity of slow boiling cannot be too strongly 
impressed upon the cook, as the contrary, ren- 
ders it hard and of a bad color ; the average 
time of boiling for fresh meat is half an hour to 
every pound, salt meat requires half as long 
again, and smoked meat still longer; the lid 
of the saucepan should only be removed for 
skimming, which is an essential process. 



50 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

Roasting chiefly depends on the skilful 
management of the fire, it is considered that a 
joint of eight pounds requires two hours roasting; 
when first put down it should be basted with 
fresh dripping, and afterwards with its own 
dripping, it should be sprinkled with salt, and 
repeatedly dredged with flour, which browns 
and makes it look rich and fi^othy. 

Broiling requires a steady clear fire, fi-ee 

from flame and smoke, the gridiron should be 

quite hot before the article is placed on it, and 

the bars should be rubbed with fat, or if the 

article is thin-skinned and delicate, with chalk; 

the gridiron should be held aslant to prevent 

the fat dripping into the fire; the bars of a 

gridiron should be close and fine. Frying is 

easier than broiling, the fat, oil or butter in 

which the article is firied must be boiling, but 

have ceased to bubble before it is put in the 

pan, or it will be greasy and black: there is 

now a new description of firyingpan, called a 

saut6 pan, and which will be found extremely 

convenient for flying small cutlets or coUops. 

Stewing is a more elaborate mode of boiling ; 
a gentle heat with frequent skimmings, are the 
points to be observed. 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 51 

Glazing is done by brushing melted jelly over 
the article to be glazed and letting it cool, and 
then adding another coat, or in some cases two 
or three, this makes any cold meats or poultry 
have an elegant appearance. 

Blanching makes the article plump and white. 
It should be set on the fire in cold water, boil 
up and then be immersed in cold water, where 
it should remain some little time. Larding (the 
French term is Piqui, which the inexperienced 
Jewish cook may not be acquainted with, we there- 
fore use the term in common use) is a term, given 
to a certain mode of garnishing the surface of meat , 
or poultry : it is inserting small pieces of the fat 
of smoked meats, truffles, or tongue, which are 
trimmed into slips of equal length and size, 
into the flesh of the article at regular distances, 
and is effected by means of larding pins. 

Poel6e jand Blanc, are terms used in modem 
cookery for a very expensive mode of stewing : 
it is done by stewing the article with meat, 
vegetables, and fat of smoked meats, all well 
seasoned ; instead of placing it to stew in water 
it is placed on slices of meat covered with slices 
of fat and the vegetables and seasoning added, 
then water enough to cover the whole is added: 



52 MEAT ANN POULTRY. 

Blanc difiers from Poel^, in having a quantity 
of suet added, and being boiled down before the 
article is placed to stew in it. 

Braising is a similar {Hocess to Poelde, but 
less meat and vegetable is used. 



TO CLARIFY SUET. 

Melt down with care fine fresh suet, either 
beef or veal, put it into a jar, and set it in a 
stew-pan of water to boil, putting in a sprig of 
rosemary, or a little orange flower water while 
melting, this is a very useful preparation and 
will be found, if adopted in English kitchens, to 
answer the purpose of lard and is far more 
delicate and wholesome: it should be well 
beaten till quite light with a wooden forL 

OLIO. 

Put eight pounds of beef in sutBcient water to' 
cover it, when the water boils take out the meat, 
skim oflP the fat, and then return the meat to the 
stew-pan, adding at the same time two fine white 
cabbages without any of the stalk or hard parts; 
season with pepper, salt, and a tea-spoonful of 
white sugar, let it simmer on a slow fire for about 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 53 

five hours, about an hour before serving, add half 
a pound of chorisa, which greatly improves the 
flavor. 



AN EXCELLENT RECEIPT FOR STEWING A RUMP 
OF BEEF. 

Chop fine a laj^e onion, four bay leaves, and 
a little parsley, add to these half an ounce of 
ground ginger, a tea-spoonfiil of salt, a blade of 
mace, a little ground allspice, some lemon sliced, 
and some of the peel grated ; rub all these ingre- 
dients well into the meat, then place it into a 
stew-pan with three parts of a cup of vinegar, a 
calfs-foot cut in small pieces and a pint of water, 
stew gently till tender, when the fat must be 
carefully skimmed off the gravy, which must be 
strained and poured over the meat 



ALAMODE BEEFÂ« OR SOUR MEAT. 

Cover a piece of the ribs of beef boned and 
fiUetted, or a piece of the round with vinegar 
diluted with water, season with onions, pepper, 
salt, whole allspice, and three or four bay leaves, 
add a cup full of raspings, and let the whole stew 
gently for three or four hours, according to the 



54 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

weight of the meat ; this dish is excellent when 
cold. A rump steak stewed in the same way will 
be found exceedingly fine. 



KIMMEL MEAT. 

Place a small piece of the rump of beef, or the 
under cut of a sirloin in a deep pan with three 
pints of vinegar, two ounces of carraway seeds 
tied in a muslin bag, salt, pepper, and spices, 
cover it down tight, and bake thoroughly in a 
slow oven. This is a fine relish for luncheons. 



BEEF AND BEANS. 

Take a piece of brisket of beef, cover it with 
water, when boiling skim off the fat, add one 
quartern of French beans cut small, two onions 
cut in quarters, season with pepper and salt, and 
when nearly done take a dessert-spoonfiil of flour, 
one of coarse brown sugar, and a large tea-cup 
full of vinegar, mix them together and stir in 
with the beans, and continue stewing for about 
half an hour longer. 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 55 

KUGEL AND COMMEAN. 

Soak one pint of Spanish peas and one pint of 
Spanish beans all night in three pints of water ; 
take two marrow bones, a calf 's-foot, and three 
pounds of fine gravy-beef, crack the bones and 
tie them to prevent the marrow escaping, and 
put all together into a pan ; then take one pound 
of flour, half a pound of shred suet, a little grated 
nutmeg and ground ginger, cloves and allspice, 
one pound of coarse brown sugar, and the crumb 
of a slice of bread, first soaked in water and 
pressed dry, mix all these ingredients together 
into a paste, grease a quart basin and put it in, 
covering the basin with a plate set in the middle 
of the pan with the beans, meat, &c. Cover the 
pan lightly down with coarse brown paper, and 
let it remain all the night and the next day, 
(until required) in a baker's oven, when done, 
take out the basin containing the pudding, and 
skim the fat from the gravy which must be 
served as soup ; the meat, &c., is extremely 
savory and nutritious, but is not a very seemly 
dish for table. The pudding must be turned 
out of the basin, and a sweet sauce flavored with 
lemon and brandv is a fine addition. 



56 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

SAUER KRA13T. 

Boil about seven or eight pounds of beef, 
either brisket or a fillet off the shoulder,in enough 
water to cover it, when it has boiled for one hour, 
add as much sauer kraut, which is a German 
preparation, as may be approved, it should then 
stew gently for four hours and be served in a 
deep dish. The Germans are not very parti- 
cular in removing the fat, but it is more deUcate 
by so doing. 

BEEF WITH CELERY, 
AND WHITE BEANS AND PEAS. 

Soak for twelve hours one pint of dried white 
peas, and half a pint of the same kind of beans, 
they must be well soaked, and if very dry, may 
require longer than twelve hours, put a nice 
piece of brisket of about eight pounds weight in 
a stew-pan with the peas and beans, and three 
heads of celery cut in small pieces, put water 
enough to cover, and season with pepper and salt 
only, let it all stew slowly till the meat is 
extremely tender and the peas and beans quite 
soft, then add four large lumps of sugar and 
nearly a tea-cup of vinegar; this is a very fine 
stew. 



MEAT AND POULTRY, 57 

BEEF COLLOPS. 

Cut thin slices off from any tender part, 
divide them into pieces of the size of a wine 
biscuit, flatten and flour them, and lightly fry 
in clarified fat, lay them in a stew-pan with 
good stock, season to taste, have pickled gherkins 
chopped small, and add to the gravy a few minutes 
before serving. 



TO WARM COLD ROAST BEEF WHEN NOT SUFFI- 
CIENTLY DONC. 

Cut it in slices, also slice some beetroot or 
cucumber and put them in a saucepan with a 
little gravy which need not be strong, two. table- 
spoonsful of vinegar, one of oil, pepper, salt, a 
little chopped lettuce and a few peas, simmer till 
the vegetables and meat are sufficiently dressed. 



TO HASH BEEF. 

The meat should be put on the fire in a little 
broth or gravy, with a little fried onion, pepper, 
salt, and a spoonful of ketchup, or any other 
sauce at hand, let it simmer for about ten 
minutes, then mix in a cup a little flour with a 



58 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

little of the gravy, and pour it into the stewpan 
to thicken the rest ; sippets of toast should be 
served with hashes, a Uttle port wine, a pinch of 
saffron, or a piece chorisa may be considered 
great improvements. 



STEAKS WITH CHESNUTS. 

Take a fine thick steak, half fry it, then flour 
and place it in a stewpan with a little good beef 
gravy, season with cayenne pepper and salt, 
when it has simmered for about ten minutes, add 
a quarter of a hundred good chesnuts, peeled 
and the inner skin scraped off*, let them stew 
with the steak till well done, this is a very nice 
dish, a little Espagnole sauce heightens the 
flavor. 



A SIMPLE STEWED STEAK. 

Put a fine steak in a stewpan with a large 
piece of clarified suet or fat, and a couple of 
onions sliced, let the steak fi-y for a few minutes, 
turning it several times; then cover the steak 
with gravy, or even water will answer the pur- 
pose, with a tea-cup full of button onions, or a 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 59 

Spanish onion sliced,* a litde lemon peel, pepper, 
salt, and a little allspice ; simmer till the steak 
is done, when the steak must be removed and 
the gravy be carefully skimmed, then add to it 
a little browning and a spoonful of mushroom 
ketchup ; the steak must be kept on a hot stove 
or returned to the stewpan to warm up. K the 
gravy is not thick enough, stir in a little floiu:. 



BRISKET STEWED WITH ONIONS AND RAISINS. 

Stew about five pounds of brisket of beef in 
sufficient water to cover, season with allspice, 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and when nearly done, 
add four large onions cut in pieces and half a 
pound of raisins stoned, let them remain sim- 
mering till well done ; and just before serving, 
stir in a tea-spoonfiil of brown sugar and a table 
spoonful of flour. 



BRISKET STEWED* 

Take about six or seven pounds of brisket of 
beef, place it in a stewpan with only enough 
water to cover it, season with a little spice tied 
in a bag; when the meat is tender and the 
spices sufficiently extracted to make the gravy rich 



fiO MEAT AND POULTRY. 

and strong, part of it must be removed to another 
saucepan ; have ready a variety of vegetables cut 
into small shapes^ such as turnips, carrots, mush- 
rooms, cauliflowers, or whatever may be in 
season ; stew them gently till tender in the gravy, 
the meat must then be glazed and the gravy 
poured in the dish, and the vegetables arranged 
round. 



BEEF RAGOUT. 

Take a small well cut piece of lean beef, lard 
it with the fat of smoked beef, and stew it with 
good gravy, highly seasoned with allspice, cloves, 
pepper and salt ; when the meat is well done 
remove it from the gravy, which skim carefiilly 
and free from every particle of fat, and add to 
it a glass of port wine, the juice of a lemon, half 
a tea-spoonftil of cayenne pepper, and a little 
mushroom ketchup ; the beef should be glazed 
when required to have an elegant appearance. 

A few very small forcemeat balls must be 
poached in the gravy, which must be poured 
over the meat, and the balls arranged round the 
dish ; this is a very savoury and pretty dish. 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 61 

TO SALT BEEF. 

This may be done by mixing a pomid of 
conunon salt, half anomice of saltpetre and one 
oonce of coarse brown sugar, and nibbing the 
meat well with it, daily for a fortnight or less, 
according to the weather, and the degree of salt 
that the meat is required to have. Or by boil- 
ing eight ounces of salt, eight ounces of sugar, 
and half an ounce of saltpetre in two quarts of 
water, and pouring it over the meat, and letting 
it stand in it for eight or ten days. 



8PICEDBEEF. 

Take a fine thick piece of brisket of beef not 
fiit, let it lay three days in a pickle, as above, take 
it out and rub in a mixture of spices consisting 
of equal quantities of ground all-spice, black 
pepper, cloves, ginger and nutmegs, and a little 
brown sugar, repeat this daily for a week, then 
cover it with pounded dried sweet herbs, roll or 
tie it tightly, put it into a pan with very little 
water, and bake slowly for eight hours, then 
take it out, untie it and put a heavy weight 
upon it ; this it a fine relish when eaten cold. 



62 Mi;AT AND POULTRY. 

SMOKED BEEF. 

As there are seldom conveniences in private 
kitchens far smoking meats, it will generally be 
the best and cheapest plan to have them ready 
prepared for cooking. All kinds of meats 
smoked and salted, are to be met with in great 
perfection at all the Hebrew butchers. 

Ckorisay that most refined and savoury of all 
sausages, is to be also procured at the same places. 
It is not only excellent fried in slices with poached 
eggs or stewed with rice, but imparts a delicious 
flavor to stews, soups, and sauces, and is one 
of the most useful resources of the Jewish 
kitchen. 



A WHITE FRICANDEAU OP VEAL. 

Take four or five pounds of breast of veal, or 
fillet firom the shoulder ; stuff* it with a finely 
flavoured veal stuffing and put it into a stewpan 
with water sufficient to cover it, a calfs-foot cut 
in pieces is sometimes added, season with one 
onion, a blade of mace, white pepper and salt, and 
a sprig of parsley, stew the whole gently imtil 
the meat is quite tender, then skim and strain 
the gravy and stir in the beaten yolks of four 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 63 

eggs, and the juice of two lemons previously mixed 
smoothly with a portion of the gravy, button 
mushrooms, or pieces of celery stewed with the 
veal are sometimes added by way of varying the 
flavor, egg and forcemeat balls garnish the dish. 
When required to look elegant it should be piqu^. 



A BROWN FRICASSEE. 



Cut a breast of veal in pieces, firy them lightly 
and put them into a stewpan with a good beef 
gravy, seasoned with white pepper, salt, a couple 
of sliced onions (previously browned in a little 
oil), and a piece of whole ginger, let it simmer 
very slowly for two hours taking care to remove 
the scum or &t, have ready some rich forcemeat and 
spread it about an inch thick over three cold hard 
boiled eggs, fiy these for a few moments and put 
them in the saucepan with the veal; before 
serving, these balls should be cut in quarters, and 
the gravy rendered more savory by the addition of 
lemon juice and half a glass of white wine, or a 
table-spooniul of walnut liquor, if the gravy is 
not sufficiently thick by long stewing, a little 
browned flour mav be stirred in. 



64 meat and poultry. 

calf's head stewed. 

Clean and soak the head till the cheek-bone 
can be easily removed, then parboil it and cut 
it into pieces of moderate size, and place them 
in about a quart of stock made from shin of beef, 
the gravy must be seasoned highly with eschalots, 
a small head of celery, a small bunch of sweet 
herbs, an onion, a carrot, a little mace, a dozen 
cloves, a piece of lemon peel, and a sprig of 
parsley, salt and pepper; it must be strained 
before the head is added, fine forcemeat balls 
rolled in egg and fried are served in the dish, as 
well as small fritters made with the brains ; when 
ready for serving, a glass and half of white wine 
and the juice of a lemon are added to the gravy. 



calves-feet with SPANISH SAUCE. 

Having cleaned, boiled and split two fine feet, 
dip them into egg and bread crumbs mixed with 
chopped parsley and chalot, a few ground cloves, 
a Uttle nutmeg, pepper and salt, fiy them a fine 
brown, arrange them in the dish and pour the 
sauce over. Make the sauce in the following 
manner : slice two fine Spanish onions, put them 



VEAL. 65 

in a saucepan, with some chopped truffles or 
mushrooms, a little suet, cayenne and white 
pepper, salt, one or two small lumps of white 
sugar, and let all simmer in some good strong 
stock till the gravy has nearly boiled away, then 
stir in a wine glass of Madeira wine, and a little 
lemon juice ; it should then be returned to the 
saucepan, to be made thoroughly hot before 
serving. 

calf's feet au fritur. 

Simmer them for four hours in water till the 
meat can be taken easily from the bone, then 
cut them in handsome pieces, season with 
pepper and salt, dip them in egg, and sprinkle 
thickly with grated bread crumbs, and fry of a 
fine even brown; they may be served dry or 
with any sauce that may be approved. 

The liquor should continue to stew with the 
bones, and can be used for jelly. 

calf's feet stewed for invalids. 
Clean and soak a fine foot, put it on in very 
little water, let it simmer till tender, then cut 
it in pieces, without removing the bone, and 

F 



66 VEAL. 

continue stewing for three hours^ till they become 
perfectly soft; if the liquor boils away, add a 
little more water, but there should not be more 
liquor than can be served in the dish with the 
foot ; the only seasoning requisite is a little salt 
and white pepper, and a sprig of parsley, or a 
pinch of safi&on to improve the appearance ; a 
little delicately-made thin egg sauce, with a 
flavor of lemon juice, may be served in a 
sauce-tureen if approved; sippets of toast or 
well boiled rice to garnish the dish, may also 
be added, and will not be an unacceptable 
addition. 



TJBNDONS OF VEAL. 

This is a very fine and nutritious dish ; cut 
from the bones of a breast of veal the tendons 
which are round the front, trim and blanch 
them, put them with slices of smoked beef into 
a stewpan with some shavings of veal, a few 
herbs, a litde sliced lemon, two or three onions, 
and a little broth ; they must simmer for seven 
or eight hours ; when done, thicken the gravy 
and add white wine and mushrooms and egg- 
balls ; a few peas with the tendons will be fomid 



VEAL. 67 

excellent, a piece of mint and a little white 
sugar will then be requisite. 



FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. 

Take a piece from the shoulder, about three 
to four poimds, trim it and form it into a well 
shaped even piece, the surface of which should 
be quite smooth ; piqiU it thickly, put it into a 
stewpan with a couple of onions, a carrot sliced, 
sweet herbs, two or three bay leaves, a large 
piece of eJwrissa or a slice of the root of a 
tongue smoked, a little whole pepper and salt ; 
cover it with a gravy made from the trimmings 
of the veal, and stew till extremely tender, 
which can be proved by probing it with a fine 
skewer, then reduce part of the gravy to a glaze, 
glaze the meat with it and serve on a pured of 
vegetables. 

COLLARED VEAL. 

Remove the bones, gristle, &c., from a nice 
piece of veal, the breast is the best part for the 
purpose; season the meat well with chopped 
herbs, mace, pepper, and salt, then lay between 
the veal slices of smoked tongue variegated 



68 VEAL. 

with beetroot, chopped parsley, and hard yolks 
of eggs, roll it up tightly in a cloth, simmer for 
some hours till tender; when done, it should 
have a weight laid on it to press out the liquor. 



CURRIED VEAL. 

Cut a breast of veal into pieces, fry lightly 
with a chopped onion, then rub the veal over 
with currie powder, put it into a good gravy of 
veal and beef, season simply with pepper, salt, 
and lemon juice. 

Fowls curried are prepared in the same way. 



' CUTLETS. 

Cut them into proper shape and beat them 
with a roller until the fibre of the meat is entirely 
broken ; if this is not done, they will be hard; 
they must then be covered with egg and 
sprinkled with flour, or a preparation for cutlets 
may be spread over them, and then fry them 
of a fine brown, remove the cutlets to a hot dish, 
and add to the fat in which the cutlets have 
been fried, a spoonful of flour, a small cup of 
gravy, salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice or 
lemon pickle. 



VEAL. 69 

CUTLETS A LA FRAN9AISE. 

French cooks cut them thinner than the 
English^ and trim them into rounds of the size 
of a tearcup ; they must be brushed over with 
egg, and sprinkled with salt, white pepper, 
mushroom powder, and grated lemon peel ; put 
them into a sataS pan and fry of a very light 
brown ; pieces of bread, smoked meat or tongue 
cut of the same size as the cutlets, and prepared 
in the same manner, are laid alternately in the 
dish with them ; they should be served without 
sauce and with a purSe of mushrooms or spinach 
in the centre of the dish. 



CUTLETS IN WHITE FRICASSEE. 

Cut them in proper shapes, put them in a 
veal gravy made with the trimmings enough to 
cover them ; season delicately, and let them sim- 
mer till quite tender, but not long enough to 
lose their shape ; fresh button mushrooms and a 
piece of lemon peel are essential to this dish ; 
when the meat is done remove it, take all fat 
from the gravy, and thicken it with the yolks 
of two beaten eggs ; small balls of forcemeat in 



70 VEAL, 

which mushrooms must be minced should be 
poached in the gravy when about to be served ; 
the meat must be returned to the saucepan to be 
made hot, and when placed in the dish, garnish 
with thin slices of lemon. 

CUTLETS IN BROWN FRICASSEE. 

They must be trimmed as above, fried slightly 
and Stewed in beef gravy, and seasoned accord- 
ing to the directions given for a brown fricassee 
of veal; balls or fritters are always an improve- 
ment to the appearance of this dish. 

BLANaUETTE OE VEAL. 

Cut into thin pieces of the size of shillings and 
half crowns, cold veal or poultry, lay it in a small 
saucepan with a handful of fresh well cleaned 
button mushrooms, pour over a Uttle veal gravy, 
only enough to cover them, with a piece of 
clarified veal fat about the size of the yolk of a 
hard boiled egg; flavor with a piece of lemon 
peel, very little white pepper and salt, one small 
lump of white sugar, and a little nutmeg, stew 
all together for fifteen minutes, then pour over 



TEAL. 71 

a sauce prepared in a separate saucepan^ made 
with veal gravy, a little lemon juice, but not 
much, and the beaten yolks of two eggs, let it 
simmer for an instant and then serve it up in the 
centre of a dish prepared with a wall of mashed 
potatoes, delicately browned ; a few truffles ren- 
ders this dish more elegant 



MINCED VEAL. 



Cut in small square pieces about the size of 
dice, cold dressed veal, put it into a saucepan 
with a little water or gravy, season simply with 
salt, pepper, and grated or minced lemon peel, 
the mince should be garnished with sippets of 
toast 



MIEOTON or VEAL. 

Mince finely some cold veal or poultry, add a 
little grated tongue, or smoked beef, a few 
crumbs of bread, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, para- 
ley, and if approved, essence of lemon, mix all 
well with two or three eggs, and a very small 
quantity of good gravy ; grease a mould, put in 



VEAL, 



the above in^edients and bake for three-quarteis 
of an hour; turn out with care^ and serve with 
mushroom sauce. 



FBICONDELLES. 

Prepare cold veal or poultry as in the last 
receipt, add instead of crumbs of bread, a French 
roll soaked in white gravy, mix with it the same 
ingredients, and form it into two shapes to imi- 
tate small chickens or sweetbreads; sprinkle with 
crumbs of bread, and place in a frying-pan as 
deep as a shallow saucepan; when they have 
fried enough to become set, pour enough weak 
gravy in the pan to cover the fricondelles, and 
let them stew in it gently, place them both in 
the same dish, and pour over any well thickened 
sauce that may be selected. 



ANOTHER SORT. 

Prepare four small pieces of veal to serve in 
one dish, according to the directions given for 
fricandeau of veal ; these form a very pretty 
entrSe ; the pieces of veal should be about the 
size of pigeons. 



VEAL, 78 

SMOKED TEAL. 

Take a fine fitt thick breast of veal, bone it^ 
lay it in pickle, according to the receipt to salt 
meat, hang it for three or four weeks in wood- 
smoke, and it will prove a very fine savoury 
relish, either boiled and eaten cold, or fiied as 
required. 



SWEETBEEADS BOASTED. 

First soak them in warm water, and then 
blanch them; in whatever manner they are to be 
dressed, this is essential ; they may be prepared 
in a variety of ways, the simplest is to roast them; 
for this they have only to be covered with egg 
and bread crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, 
and finished in a Dutch oven or cradle spit, fire- 
quently basting with clarified veal suet ; they 
may be served either dry with a purie of 
vegetables, or with a brown gravy. 



SWEETBEEADS STEWED WHITE. 

After soaking and blanching, stew them in 
veal gravy, and season with celery, pepper, salt, 
nutmeg, a little mace, and a piece of lemon peel, 



74 VEAL. 

they should be served with a fine white sauce, 
the gravy in which they are stewed will form 
the basis for it, with the addition of yolks of 
eggs and mushroom essence ; French cooks would 
adopt the vehutS or bechamSl sauce; Jerusalem 
artichokes cut the size of button mushrooms, are 
a suitable accompaniment as a garnish. 



SWEETBEEADS STEWED BROWN. 

After soaking and blanching, fiy them till 
brown, then simmer gently in beef gravy seasoned 
highly with smoked meat, nutmeg, pepper, salt, 
a small onion stuck vdth cloves, and a very 
little whole allspice ; the gravy must be slightly 
thickened, and morels and truffles are generally 
added ; small balls of delicate forcemeat are also 
an improvement The above receipts are adapted 
for sweetbreads fricasseed, except that they must 
be cut in pieces for fricassees, and pieces of 
meat or poultry are added to them ; sweetbreads 
when dressed whole look better piquis^ 



MUTTON. 75 

A DELICATE RECEIPT FOR ROAST MUTTON. 

Put the joint in a saucepan, cover it with cold 
water, let it boil for half an hour, have the spit 
and fire quite ready, and remove the meat fix)m 
the saucepan, and place it immediately down to 
roast, baste it well, dredge it repeatedly with 
flour, and sprinkle with salt; this mode of roast- 
ing mutton removes the strong flavor that is so 
disagreeable to some tastes. 



MUTTON 8TEWED WITH CELEET. 

Take the best end of a neck of mutton, or a 
fillet taken fi-om the leg or shoulder, place it in 
a stewpan with just enough water to cover it, 
throw in a carrot and turnip, and season, but not 
too highly; when nearly done remove the meat 
and strain off the gravy, then return both to the 
stewpan with forcemeat balls and some fine 
celery cut in small pieces ; let all stew gently till 
perfectly done, then stir in the yolks of two eggs, 
a little flour, and the juice of half a lemon, which 
must be mixed with a little of the gravy before 
pouring in the stewpan, and care must be taken 
to prevent curdling. 



76 MUTTON. 

A SIMPLE WAY OF DRESSING MUTTON. 

Take the fillet off a small leg or shoulder of 
mutton, rub it well over with egg and seasoning, 
and partly roast it, then place it in a stewpan 
with a little strong gravj, and stew gently till 
thoroughly done ; this dish is simple, but ex- 
ceedingly nice; a few balls or flitters to garnish 
will improve it 



MAINTENON CUTLETS. 

This is merely broiling or filing cutlets in a 
greased paper, after having spread on them a 
seasoning prepared as follows: make a paste of 
bread crumbs, chopped parsley, nutmeg, pepper, 
salt, grated lemon peel, and thyme, with a couple 
of beaten e^s; a piquante sauce should be 
served in a tureen. 



A HABBIOOT. 

Cut off the best end of a neck of mutton into 
chops, flour and partly Grj them, then lay them 
in a stewpan with carrots, sliced turnips cut in 
small round balls, some button onions, and cover 
with water; skim frequently, season with pepper 



MUTTON, 77 

and salt to taste^ color the gravy with a little 
browning and a spoonful of mushroom powder. 



IRISH STEW. 

Is the same as above^ excepting that the meat 
is not previously fried^ and that potatoes are 
used instead of turnips and carrots. 

MUTTON A L'hISPANIOLA. 

Take a small piece of mutton, either part of a 
shoulder or a fillet of the leg, partly roast it, 
then put it in a stewpan with beef gravy enough 
to cover it, previously seasoned with herbs, a 
carrot and turnip ; cut in quarters three large 
Spanish onions, and place in the stewpan roimd 
the meat; a stuffing will improve it, and care 
must be taken to free the gravy from every par- 
ticle of fat 



MUTTON COLLOPS. 

Take from a fine knuckle a couple of slices, 
cut and trim them in coUops the size of a tea 
cup, flatten them and spread over each side a 
forcemeat for cutlets, and fry them ; potatoe or 



78 MUTTON. 

Jerusalem artichokes cut in slices of the same 
size and thickness^ or pieces of bread cut \vith a 
fluted cutter^ prepared as the collops and fried, 
must be placed altemately in the dish with them ; 
they may be served with a pure simple gravy, or 
very hot and dry on a napkin, garnished with 
fried parsley and slices of lemon. 

The knuckle may be used in the following 
manner : put it on with suflScient water to cover 
it, season it and simmer till thoroughly done, 
thicken the gravy with prepared barley, and 
flavor it with lemon pickle, or capers ; it should 
be slightly colored with safiron, and celery sauce 
may be served as an accompaniment, or the 
mutton may be served on a fine purie of turnips. 



MUTTON CUTLETS. 

â¢ Have a neck of mutton, cut the bones short, 
and remove the chine bone completely; cut 
chops ofi^ so thin that every other one shall be 
without bone, trim them carefuUy, that all the 
chops shall bear the same appearance, then 
flatten them well; cover them with a cutlet pre- 
paration, and fry of a delicate brown ; a fine 
pur^e of any vegetable that may be approved. 



MUTTON, 79 

or any sauce that may be selected^ should be 
served with them; they may be arranged in 
various ways in the dish^ either round the dish 
or in a circle in the centre5 so that the small 
part of the cutlets shall almost meet; if the 
latter, the purSe should garnish round them 
instead of being in the centre of the dish. 



MUTTON HAM. 

Choose a fine leg of mutton, rub it in daily 
with a mixture of three ounces of brown sugar, 
two ounces of common salt, and half an ounce 
of saltpetre, continue this process for a fortnight, 
then hang it to dry in wood smoke for ten days 
longer. 

LAMB AND SFKEW. 

Take a fine neck or breast of lamb, put it in 
stewpan with as much water as will cover it, add 
to it a bundle of sprew cut in pieces of two inches 
in length, a small head of celely cut small, and 
one onion, pepper, salt, and a sprig of parsley, 
let it simmer gently till the meat and sprew are 
tender; a couple of lumps of sugar improves the 
flavor; there should not be too much liquor, and 



80 MUTTON. 

all &t must be removed ; the sprew should sur- 
round the meat when served, and also be thickly 
laid over it. 



LAMB AND PSAS. 

Take the best end of a neck of lamb, either 
keep it whole or divide it into chops as may be 
preferred, put it into a saucepan with a little 
chopped onion, pepper, salt, and a small quan- 
tity of water ; when half done add half a peck 
of peas, half a lettuce cut fine, a little mint, and 
a few lumps of sugar, and let it stew thoroughly ; 
when done, there must not be too much liquor ; 
cutlets of veal or beef are also excellent dressed 
as above. Although this is a spring dish it may 
be almost equally well dressed in winter, by 
substituting small mutton cutlets and preserved 
peas, which may be met with at any of the best 
Italian warehouses; a breast or neck of lamb 
may also be stewed whole in the same manner. 

LAMB CUTLETS WITH CUCUMBERS. 

Take two fine cucumbers, peel and cut them 
lengthways, lay them in vinegar for an hour, 
then stew them in good stock till tender, when 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 81 

Stir in the yolks of two or three eggs, a little 
flour and essence of lemon, which must all be 
first mixed up together with a little of the stock, 
have ready some cutlets trinmied and firied a 
light brown, arrange them round the dish and 
pour the cucumbers in the centre. 

A NICS BECEIPT FOR SHOULDER OF LAMB. 

Half boil it, score it and squeeze over lemon 
juice, and cover with grated bread crumbs, egg 
and parsley, broil it over a clear fire and put it to 
brown in a Dutch oven, or grill and serve with a 
sauce seasoned with lemon pickle and chopped 
mint 

A CASSEREET, AN EAST INDIA DISH. 

Take two pounds of lamb chops, or mutton 
may be substituted, place them in a stewpan, 
cover with water or gravy, season only with pep- 
per and salt, when the chops are half done, 
carefiilly skim off the fat and add two table 
spoonsful of cassereet, stir it in the gravy which 
should not be thickened, and finish stewing 
gently till done enough; rice should accompany 
this dish. 



82 MEAT AND PODLTKY. 

TUBKET BONED AND TOBCED. 

A turkey thus prepared may be either boiled 
or roasted; there are directions for boning 
poultry which might be given, but it is always 
better to let the poulterer do it; when boned it 
must be filled with a fine forcemeat, which may 
be varied in several ways, the basis should be 
according to the receipt given for veal stuffings, 
forcemeats, sausage meat, tongue, and mush- 
rooms added as approved. When boiled it is 
served with any fine white sauce, French cooks 
use the velout^ or bechamel. When roasted, a 
cradle spit is very convenient, but if there is not 
one the turkey must be carefully tied to the spit. 



FOWLS BONED AND TOBCED. 

The above directions serve also for fowls. 



A SAVOUBY WAY OF BOASTING A FOWL. 

Fill it with a fine seasoning, and just before it 
is ready for serving, baste it well with clarified 
veal suet, and sprinkle it thickly with very dry 
crumbs of bread, repeat this two or three times; 
then place it in the dish, and serve with a fijie 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 83 

brown gravy well flavored with lemon juice; 
delicate forcemeat fritters should be also served 
in the dish. 



BOILED FOWLS. 

Are served with a fine white sauce5 and are 
often garnished with pieces of white cauliflower, 
or vegetable marrow, the chief object is to keep 
them white ; it is best to select white legged 
poultry for boiling, as they prove whiter when 
dressed. 



AMNASTICH. 

Stew gently one pint of rice in one quart of 
strong gravy till it begins to swell, then add an 
onion stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and a chicken stuffed with forcemeat, let it stew 
with the rice till thoroughly done, then take it 
up and stir in the rice, the yolks of four eggs, 
and the juice of a lemon ; serve the fowl in the 
same dish with the rice, which should be colored 
to a fine yellow with saflron. 



FOWLS STEWED WITH RICE AND CHORISA. 

Boil a fowl in suflScient water or gravy to 



84 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

cover it^ when boiling for ten minutes^ skim off 
the fat and add half a pound of rice5 and one 
pound of chorisa cut in about four pieces5 season 
with a little white pepper, salt, and a pinch of 
safiron to color it, and then stew till the rice is 
thoroughly tender; there should be no gravy 
when served, but the rice ought to be perfectly 
moist. 



CURRIED CHICKEN. 

See curried veal. Undressed chicken is con- 
sidered best for a curry, it must be cut in small 
joints, the directions for curried veal are equally 
adapted for fowls, 

A NICE METHOD OF DRESSING FOWL 
AND SWEETBREAD. 

Take a fowl and blanch it, also a fine sweet 
bread, parboil them, then cut off in smooth well 
shaped sUces, all the white part of the fowl, and 
sUce the sweetbread in similar pieces, place 
them together in a fine well-flavoured veal 
gravy; when done, serve neatly in the dish, and 
pour over a fine white sauce, any that may be 
approved, the remainder of the fowl must be 
cut up in small joints or pieces, not separated 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 85 

from the bone, and fried to become bro'wn, then 
place them in a stew-pan with forcemeat balls, 
truffles, and morels ; pour over half or three 
quarters of a pint of beef gravy, and simmer till 
finished ; a little mushroom ketchup, or lemon- 
pickle may be added ; in this manner two very 
nice entries may be formed. 

BLANKETTE OF FOWL. 

See blankette of veaL 

TO STEW DUCK WITH GREEN PEAS. 

Stuff and half roast a duck, then put it into 
a stew-pan with an onion sliced, a little mint and 
about one pint of beef gravy, add after it has 
simmered half an hour, a quart of green peas, 
and simmer another half hour ; a little lump 
sugar is requisite. 

TO WARM COLD POULTRY. 

Cut up the pieces required to be dressed, 
spread over them a seasoning as for cutlets, and 
fry them ; pour over a little good gravy, and 
garnish with sippets of toast and sliced lemon, 
or place them in an edging of rice or mashed 
potatoes. 



86 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

BROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOMS. 

Truss a fine fowl as if for boiling, split it down 
the back, and broil gently ; when nearly done, 
])ut it in a stewpan with a good gravy, add a 
pint of fresh button mushrooms, season to taste ; 
a little mushroom powder and lemon juice im- 
prove the flavour. 

PIGEONS. 

To have a good appearance they should be 
larded and stuffed ; glazing is also an improve- 
ment, they form a nice entrSe; they may be 
stewed in a strong gravy ; when done enough, 
remove the pigeons, thicken the gravy, add a 
few forcemeat and egg balls, and serve in the 
dish with the pigeons. Or they may be split 
down the back, broiled, and then finished in the 
stew-pan. 



STEWE D Gl BLETS. 



Scald one or more sets of giblets, set them 
on the fire with a little veal or chicken, or both, 
in a good gravy ; season to taste, thicken the 
gravy, and color it with browning, flavor with 
mushroom powder and lemon-juice and one glass 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 87 

of white wine ; forcemeat balls should be added 
a few minutes before serving, and garnish with 
thin slices of hard boiled eggs. 

DUTCH TOAST. 

Take the remains of any cold poultry or meat, 
mince it and season highly ; add to it any cold 
dressed vegetable, mix it up with one or more 
eggs, and let it simmer till hot in a little grivy ; 
have ready a square of toast, and serve it on it ; 
squeeze over a little lemon-juice, and sprinkle 
with white pepper. Vegetables prepared in this 
way are excellent; cauUflower simmered in 
chicken broth, seasoned delicately and minced 
on toast, is a nutritive good luncheon for an 
invalid. 



TIMBALE DE MACCARONI. 

This is a very pretty dish. The maccaroni 
must be boiled in water till it slightly swells, and 
is soft enough to cut ; it must be cut into short 
pieces about two inches in length. Grease a 
mould, and stick the maccaroni closely together 
all over the mould ; when this is done, and which 
will require some patience, fill up the space with 



88 MEAT AND POULTRY. 

fiiccassee of chicken, sweetbreads, or whatever 
may be Uked; close the mould carefully, and 
boiL Rich white sauce is usually served with 
it, but not poured over the timbale, as it would 
spoil the effect of the honeycomb appearance, 
which is very pretty. 



A SAVOURY PIE FOR PERSONS OF DELICATE 
DIGESTION. 

Cut up fowl and sweetbread, lay in the dish 
in alternate layers with meat, jelly, and the 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs without the whites, and 
flavor with lemon-juice, white pepper, and salt ; 
cover with rice prepared as follows : boil half a 
pound of rice in suflicient water to permit it to 
swell ; when tender beat it up to a thick paste 
with the yolk of one or two eggs, season with a 
little salt, and spread it over the dish thickly. 
The fowl and sweetbread should have been pre- 
viously simmered till half done in a little weak 
broth ; the pie must be baked in a gentle oven, 
and if the rice will not brown sufSciently, finish 
with a salamander. 



MEAT AND POULTRY. 89 

DESCAIDES. 

Take the livers of chickens or any other poul- 
try ; stew it gently in a little good gravy sea- 
soned with a little onion, mushroom essence, 
pepper, and salt ; when tender, remove the livers, 
place them on a paste board, and mince them ; 
return them to the saucepan, and stir in the 
yolks of one or two eggs, according to the quan- 
tity of liver, until the gravy becomes thick ; 
have a round of toast ready on a hot plate, and 
serve it on the toast ; this is a very nice limcheon 
or supper dish.

CHAPTER V. 



DIRECTIONS FOB CLEANING AND BOILING 
VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables are extremely nutritious when suf- 
ficiently boiled, but are unwholesome and indi- 
gestible when not thoroughly dressed ; still they 
should not be over boiled, or they will lose their 
flavor. 

Vegetables should be shaken to get out any 
insects, and laid in water with a little salt 

Soft water is best suited for boiling vegetables, 
and they require plenty of water; a little salt 
should be put in the saucepan with them, and 
the water should almost invariably be boiling 
when they are put in. 

Potatoes are much better when steamed. Peas 



VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 91 

and several other vegetables are also improved 
by this mode of cooking them^ although it is 
seldom adopted in England. 



MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil till perfectly tender ; let them be quite 
dry, and press them through a cullender, or 
mash and beat them well with a fork ; add a piece 
of butter, and milk, or cream, and continue beat- 
ing till they are perfectly smooth ; return them 
to the saucepan to warm, or they may be browned 
before the fire. The chief art is to beat them 
suflSciently long, which renders them light 

Potatoe balls are mashed potatoes formed into 
balls glazed with the yolk of egg, and browned 
with a salamander. 



POTATO WALL^ OR EDGING. 

Raise a wall of finely-mashed potatoes, of two 
or three inches high, round the dish ; form it 
with a spoon to the shape required, brush it over 
with egg, and put it in the oven to become hot 
and brown ; if it does not brown nicely, use the 
salamander. Rice is arranged the same way to 



92 VEGETABLES AND SUNDBISS. 

edge curries or fricassees ; it must be first boiled 
till tender. 



POTATOE SHAVINGS. 

Take four fine lai^e potatoes^ and having 
peeled them^ continue to cut them up as if peel- 
ing them in ribbons of equal width ; then throw 
the shavings into a firying-pan, and fry of a fine 
brown ; they must be constantly moved with a 
silver fork to keep the pieces separate. They 
should be laid on a cloth to drain^ and placed 
in the dish lightly. 

THE FRENCH WAY OF DRESSING SPINAC&. 

Wash and boil tiU tender, then squeeze and 
strain it ; press it in a towel till almost dry ; put 
it on a board, and chop it as finely as possible ; 
then return it to the saucepan, with butter, pep- 
per, and salt ; stir it all the time, and let it boil 



STEWED SPINACH. 

Scald and chop some spinach small ; cut up 
an onion; add pepper and salt and brown sugar. 



VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 93 

with a little vinegar, stew all together gently ; 
serve with poached eggs or small forcemeat frit- 
ters. This forms a pretty side-dish, and is also 
a nice way of dressing spinach to serve in the 
same dish with cutlets. 



TO STEW SPANISH BEANS AND PEAS. 

Soak the beans over night in cold water; they 
must be stewed in only sufficient water to cover 
them, with two table spoonsful of oil, a little 
pepper and salt, and white sugar. When done 
they should be perfectly soft and tender. 



PEAS STEWED WITH OIL. 

Put half a peck of peas into a stew-pan, half 
a lettuce chopped small, a little mint, a small 
onion cut up, two table-spoonsful of oil, and a 
dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar, with water 
sufficient to cover the peas, watching, from time 
to time, that they do not become too dry ; let 
them stew gently, taking care that they do not 
bum, till perfectly soft. When done they should 
look of a yellowish brown. 

French beans, brocoli, and greens, stewed in 
the above manner will be found excellent 



94 VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 
CUCUMBER MANGO. 

Cut a large cacamber in half, length ways, 
scoop out the seedy part, and lay it in vinegar 
that has been boiled with mustard-seed, a little 
garUc, and spices, for twenty-four hours, then 
fill the cucumber with highly-seasoned force- 
meat, and stew it in a rich gravy, the cucumber 
must be tied to keep it together. 



CABBAGE AND RICE. 

Scald till tender a fine summer white cabbage^ 
then chop it up small, and put it into a stew- 
pan, with a large cup of rice, also previously 
scalded, add a Uttle water, a large piece of but- 
ter, salt and pepper; let it stew gently till 
thoroughly done, stirring from time to time, and 
adding water and butter to prevent its getting 
too thick ; there should be no gravy in the dish 
when served. 



PALESTINE SALAD, 

Take a dozen fine Jerusalem artichokes, boil 
till tender, let the water strain off, and when 
cold cut them in quarters, and pour over a fine 



VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 95 

salad mixture ; the artichokes should lay in the 
sauce half an hour before serving. This salad is 
a very refreshing one, and has the advantage of 
being extremely wholesome. 



A SPRING DISH. 

Take one quart of young peas, a little mint, a 
few lumps of sugar, a little salt and white pepper, 
simmer them gently in one pint of water, when 
the peas are half done, throw in small dumplings 
made of paste, as if for short crust, and 
sweetened with a little brown sugar, beat up two 
eggs, and drop in a spoonful at a time, just be- 
fore serving ; it will require a deep dish, as the 
liquor is not to be strained off. Some prefer 
the eggs poached. 

CARROTS AU BEURRE. 

Boil them enough to be perfectly tender, then 
cut them in quarters, and again in lengtlis of 
three inches, drain them from the water, and 
put to them a piece of butter, salt and pepper, 
and simmer them for a few minutes without 
boiling ; a large piece of butter must be used. 



96 TBOETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 

French beans are good dressed in the same 
way. 



PUREE Ot VEGETABLES. 

Take any vegetable that may be approved, 
boil till well done, drain away all water, reduce 
the vegetable to a pulp, and add to it any fine 
sauce, to make it of the consistency of a very 
thick custard. 



JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES FRIED. 

Cut in slices after parboiling them, dip in 
batter, and firy. 



STEWED RED CABBAGE. 

Clean and remove the outer leaves, slice it as 
thinly as possible, put it in a saucepan with a 
large piece of butter, and a tea cup full of water, 
salt and pepper; let it stew slowly till very 
tender. 



MUSHROOMS AU NATUREL. 

Clean some fine fi*esh mushrooms, put them 
in a saucepan with a large piece of butter. 



VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 97 

pepper and salt; let them simmer until tender, 
and serve them with no other sauce than^at^in 
which they have been dressed. Also stewed in* 
a veal gravy, and served with white sauce on a. 
toast, they form a nice and pretty dish. 

The large flap mushrooms may be stewed in 
gravy, or simply broiled, seasoned with cayenne 
pepper, salt, and lemon juice. 



DRY TOMATO SOD P. 



Brown a couple of onions in a little oil, about 
two table-spoonsful or more, according to the 
number of tomatos ; when hot, add about six 
tomatos cut and peeled, season with cayenne 
pepper and salt, and let the whole simmer for a 
short time, then cut thin slices of bread, and put 
as much with the tomatos as will bring them to the 
consistency of a pudding ; it must be well beaten 
up, stir in the yolks of two or three eggs, and 
two ounces of butter warmed ; turn the whole 
into a deep dish and bake it very brown. 
Crumbs of bread should be strewed over the top, 
and a little warmed butter poured over. 



98 VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 

DEVILLED BISCUITS* 

Butter some biscuits on both sides, and pepper 
them well, make a paste of either chopped an- 
chovies, or fine cheese, and spread it on the 
biscuit, with mustard and cayenne pepper, and 
grill them. 

SAVOURY EGGS. 

Boil some eggs hard, put them into cold water, 
cut them into halves, take out the yolks, beat 
them up in a mortar with grated hung beef, fill 
the halves with this mixture, fiy lightly, and 
serve with brown gravy 



SAVOURY CHEESE CAKES. 

Grate finely an equal quantity of stale bread 
and good cheese, season with a little pepper and 
salt, mix into a batter with eggs, form into thin 
cakes and fiy. 



SCALLOPED EGGS. 



Poach lightly three or four eggs, place them 
in a dish, pour upon them a little warm butter; 



VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 99 

sprinkle with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, strew 
over with crumbs of bread, and brown before the 
fire. 



MACCARONI AND CHEESE. 

Boil some maccaroni in milk or water until 
tender, then drain them and place on a dish with 
bits of butter and grated Parmesan cheese ; 
when the dish is filled grate more cheese over it 
and brown before the fire. 



A FINE RECEIPT FOR A SAVOURY OMELETTE. 

Break four eggs, beat them up till thin enough 
to pass through a hair sieve, then beat them 
up till perfectly smooth and thin ; a small ome- 
lette fi:ying-pan is necessary for cooking it well. 
Dissolve in it a piece of butter, about an ounce 
and a half, pour in the egg, and as soon as it 
rises and is firm, slide it on to a warm plate and 
fold it over ; it should only be fiied on one side, 
and finely minced herbs should be sprinkled 
over the uniried side with pepper and salt. A 
salamander is firequently held over the unfiled 
side of the omelette to take off the rawness it 
may otherwise have. 



100 VEGETABLE8 AND SUNDRIES. 

CHORISl. OMELETTE. 

Add to the eggs, after they are well beaten as 
directed in the last receipt, half a tea-cup full of 
finely minced chorisa; this omelette must be 
lightly fried on both sides, or the salamander 
held over long enough to dress the chorisa^ 



RAMAKINS. 

Mix together three eggs, one ounce of warmed 
butter, and two of fine cheese grated, and bake 
in small patty pans. 



RISSOLES. 

Make a fine forcemeat of any cold meat, poul- 
try, or fish, enclose it in a very rich pufi^ paste, 
rolled out extremely thin. They may be made 
into bails or small triangular turnovers, or into 
long narrow ribbons ; the edges must be pressed 
together, that they may not burst in frying. 
They form a pretty dish. 



CROaUETTES. 

Pound any cold poultry, meat, or fish, make 
it into a delicate forcemeat ; the flavor can be 



VEOETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 101 

varied according to taste ; minced mushrooms, 
herbs, parsley, grated lemon peel, are suitable 
for poultry and veal ; minced anchovies should 
be used instead of mushrooms when the cro- 
quettes are made of fish. Form the mixture 
into balls or oval shapes the size of small eggs; 
dip them into beaten eggs, thickly sprinkle with 
bread crumbs or pounded vermicelli, and fiy of 
a handsome brown. 



CASSEROLE AU RIZ. 

Boil some rice till quite tender, make it into 
a firm paste with one e^ and a couple of table- 
spoons of strong gravy ; then line the inside of 
a mould with the paste of sufiicient thickness to 
turn out without breaking. Some cooks fill the 
mould instead of lining it only, and scoop away 
the centre. After it is turned out the rice must 
stand till cold, before it is removed fix)m the 
mould ; then fill the rice with fi*iccassee of fowl 
and sweetbread, with a rich white sauce, and 
place it in the oven to become hot and brown. 
The mould used for a casserole is oval and 
fluted, and resembles a cake mould. It is as well 
to observe, it cannot be made in a jelly mould. 



102 VEGETABLES AND SUNDRIES. 

A FONDU. 

Make into a batter one ounce and a half of 
potatoe flour, with the same quantity of grated 
cheese and of butter, and a quarter of a pint of 
milk or cream; add a Uttle salt, very little 
pepper, and the well-beaten yolks of four fine 
fi'esh eggs ; when all this is well mixed together, 
pour in the whites of the eggs, well whisked to 
a froth; pour the mixture into a deep soup 
plate or dish, used expressly for the purpose, 
and bake in a moderate oven. The dish should 
be only half filled with the fonduy as it will rise 
very high. It must be served the moment it is 
ready, or it will fall. It is a good plan to hold 
a salamander over it while being brought to 
table. 

PETITS PONDEAUS. 

Make a batter as for a fondu, but use rice 
flour or arrow root instead of potatoe flour ; add 
the egg in the same manner as for a fondu, 
and pour the mixture into small paper trays 
fringed round the top. The mixture should only 
half fill the trays or cases.

CHAPTER VL 



DIEECTIONS FOR MAKING PASTE. 

To make good light paste requires much prac- 
tice ; as it is not only from the proportions, but 
from the manner of mixing the various ingre- 
dients, that paste acquires its good or bad 
qualities. 

Paste should be worked up very lightly, and 
no strength or pressure used; it should be rolled 
out from you^ as lightly as possible. A marble 
slab is better than a board to make paste on. 

The flour should be dried for some time 
before the fire previously to being used. In 
forming it into paste it should be wetted as little 
as possible, to prevent its being tough. It is a 



104 PASTRY. 

great mistake to imagine lard is better adapted 
for pastry than butter or clarified fat ; it may 
make the paste lighter, but neither the color nor 
the flavor will be nearly so good, and the saying 
is extremely trifling. 

To ensure lightness, paste should be set in the 
oven directly it is made. 

Puff paste requires a brisk oven. 

Butter should be added to the paste in small 
pieces. 

The more times th^ paste is folded and roUed, 
if done with a light hand and the butter added 
with skill, the richer and lighter it will prove. 
It is no longer customary to line the dish for 
pies and finiit tarts. 



PLAIN PUFF PASTE. 

Mix a pound of flour into a stiff paste with a 
Uttle water, first having rubbed into it about two 
ounces of butter, then roll it out; add by de- 
grees the remainder of the butter (there should 
be altogether half a pound of butter), fold the 
paste and roll about two or three times. 



PASTRY* 105 

VERY RICH PUFF PASTE. 

Mix in the same manner equal quantities of 
butter and flour, taking care to have the flour 
dried for a short time before the fire ; it may be 
folded and rolled five or six times. This paste 
is well suited to vol-au-vents and tartlets; an 
egg well beaten and mixed with the paste is 
sometimes added* 



PLAIN SHORT CRUST. 

Put half a pound of fi'esh butter to a pound of 
flour, add the yolks of two eggs and a little 
powdered sugar, mix into a paste with water, 
and roll out once. 



EGG PASTE, CALLED IN MODERN COOKERY NOUILLES. 

This is formed by making a paste of flour and 
beaten eggs, without either butter or water ; it 
must be rolled out extremely thin and left to 
dry ; it may then be cut into narrow strips or 
stamped with paste cutters. It is more fashion- 
able in soups than vermiceUi. 



106 PASTRY. 

BEEF DRIPPING PASTE. 

Mix half a pound of clarified dripping into 
one pound of flour ; work it into a paste with 
water, and roll out twice. This is a good paste 
for a common meat pie. 



GLAZE FOR PASTRY. 

When the pastry is neariy baked, brush it 
over with white of egg, cover it thickly with 
sifted sugar, and brown it in the oven, or it may 
be browned with a salamander. 



For savory pies beat the yolk of an egg, dip a 
paste-brush into it, and lay it on the crust before 
baking. 



FRUIT TARTS OR PIES. 

A finiit tart is so common a sweet that it is 
scarcely necessary to give any directions con- 
cerning it. Acid fiiiits are best stewed before 
putting into a pie: the usual proportions are 
half a pound of sugar to a quart of fruit â not 
quite so much if the firuit is ripe; the fiiiit 
should be laid high in the middle of the dish, to 



PASTRY. 107 

make the pie a good shape. It is the fashion to 
lay over the crust, when nearly baked, an icing 
of the whites of eggs whisked with sugar; the 
tart or pie is then replaced in the oven. 



A VERY FINE SAVOURY PIE. 

Lay a fine veal cutlet, cut in pieces and sea- 
soned, at the bottom of the dish ; lay over it a 
layer of smoked beef fat, then a layer of fine 
cold jelly made fi'om gravy-beef and veal, then 
hard boiled eggs in slices, then chicken or sweet- 
bread, and then again the jelly, and so on till 
the dish is filled; put no water, and season 
highly with lemon-juice, essence of mushroom, 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg; also, if approved, a 
blade of mace : small cakes of fine forcemeat 
are an improvement; cover with a fine pufF 
paste, and brush over with egg, and bake. 



TARTLETS. 

Make a very rich light pufi^ paste, and roll it 
out to half an inch of thickness ; it should be 
cut with fluted paste-cutters, lightly baked, and 
the centre scooped out afterwards, and the sweet- 



108 PASTRY. 

meat or jam inserted ; a pretty dish of pastry 
may be made by cutting the paste in ribbons of 
three inches in length, and one and a half in 
width; bake them lightly, and pile them one 
upon another, with jam between each, in the 
form of a cone. 



CHEESECAKES. 

Warmfour ounces of butter, mix it with the same 
quantity of loaf-sugar sifted, grate in the rind of 
three lemons, squeeze in the juice of one, add 
three well-beaten eggs, a litde nutmeg, and a 
spoonAil of brandy ; put this mixture into small 
tins lined with a light puff paste, and bake. 

Cheesecakes can be varied by putting almonds 
beaten instead of the lemon, or by substituting 
Seville oranges, and adding a few slices of can- 
died orange and lemon peel. 



GIBLET PIE. 

Prepare the giblets as for " stewed gibleUy^ 
they should then be laid in a deep dish, covered 
with a puff paste, and baked. 



PASTRY. 109 

MOLINA PIE. 

Mince finely cold veal or chicken, with smoked 
beef or tongue; season well, add lemon-juice 
and a little nutmeg, let it simmer in a small 
quantity of good beef or veal gravy ; while on 
the fire, stir in the yolks of four eggs, put it in 
a dish to cool, and then cover with a rich pastry, 
and bake it 



VOLAUVENT. 

This requires the greatest lightness in the 
pastry, as all depends upon its rising when 
baked ; it should be rolled out about an inch 
and a half in thickness, cut it with a fluted tin 
of the size of the dish in which it is to be served. 
Also cut a smaller piece, which must be rolled 
out considerably thinner than an inch, to serve 
as a lid for the other part ; bake both pieces, 
and when done, scoop out the cnimb of the 
largest, and fill it with a white fiicassee of chicken, 
sweetbread, or whatever may be selected ; the 
sauce should be well thickened, or it would 
soften, and run through the crust. 



1 10 PASTRY. 

A VOL-AU-VBNT OP PEUIT. 

It is now the fiishion to fill vol-au-vents with 
fruits richly stewed with sugar until the syrup 
is almost a jelly ; it forms a very pretty entre- 
m^t 



PETITS V0L-AU-VENT8. 

These are made in the same way, but cut in 
small rounds, the crumb of the larger is scooped 
out, and the hollow filled with any of the varieties 
of patty preparations or preserved fiiiits. 



MINCÂ£ PIES. 

Grease and line tin patty-pans with a fine 
pufi* paste rolled out thin ; fill them with mince- 
meat, cover them with another piece of paste, 
moisten the edges, close them carefiilly, cut 
them evenly round, and bake them about haiÂ£ 
an hour in a well-heated oven. 



PATTY MEATS 

May be prepared from any dressed materials, 
such as cold dressed veal, beef and mutton. 



PASTRY. Ill 

poultry, sweetbreads, and fish; the chief art 
is to mince them properly, and give them 
the appropriate flavor and sauce; for veal, 
sweetbreads, and poultry, which may be used 
together or separately, the usual seasonings are 
mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt, mushrooms 
minced, or in powder, lemon-peel, and some- 
times the juice also ; the mince is warmed in a 
small quantity of white sauce, not too thin, and 
the patty crusts, when ready baked, are filled 
with it. 

For beef and mutton the seasonings are salt, 
pepper, allspice, a few sweet herbs powdered, with 
the addition, if approved, of a little ketchup ; 
the mince must be warmed in strong well- 
thickened beef gravy. 

If the mince is of fish, season with anchovy 
sauce, nutmeg, lemon-peel, pepper and salt; 
warm it in a sauce prepared with butter, flour, 
and milk or cream, worked together smoothly 
and stirred till it thickens ; the mince is then 
simmered in it for a few minutes, till hot ; the 
seasonings may be put with the sauces, instead 
of with the mince.

CHAPTER VTL 



GENERAL REMARKS. 

The freshness of all ingredients for puddings 
is of great importance. 

Dried fruits should be carefully picked, and 
sometimes washed and should then be dried. 
Rice, sago, and all kinds of seed should be 
soaked and well washed before they are mixed 
into puddings. 

Half an hour should be allowed for boiling 
a bread pudding in a half pint basin, and so on 
in proportion. 

All puddings of the custard kind require 
gentle boiling, and when baked must be set in 
a moderate oven. 



SWEET DISHES, ETC. 113 

By whisking to a solid froth the whites of the 
eggs used for any pudding, and stirring them 
into it at the moment of placing it in the oven, 
it will become exceedingly light and rise high 
in the dish. 

All baked puddings should be baked in tin 
moulds in the form of a deep pie dish, but 
slightly fluted, it should be well greased by 
pouring into it a little warmed butter, and then 
turned upside down for a second, to drain away 
the superfluous butter ; then sprinkle, equally all 
over, sifted white sugar, or dried crumbs of 
bread, then pour the pudding mixture into the 
mould ; it should, when served, be turned out 
of the mould, when it will look rich and brown, 
and have the appearance of a cake. 

To ensure the lightness of cakes, it is necessary 
to have all the ingredients placed for an hour or 
more before the fire, that they may all be warm 
and of equal temperature ; without this precau- 
tion, cakes will be heavy even when the best 
ingredients are employed. Great care and ex- 
perience are required in the management of the 
oven; to ascertain when a cake is sufficiently 
baked, plunge a knife into it, draw it instantly 
away, when, if the blade is sticky, return the 



114 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

cake to the oven ; ii^ on the contrary, it appears 
unsoiled the cake is ready. 

The lightness of cakes depends upon the in- 
gredients being beaten well together. All stiff 
cakes may be beaten with the hand, but pound 
cakes, sponge, &c., should be beaten with a whisk 
or spoon. 



SOLA d'amoe. 
The recipe for this much celebrated and ex- 
quisite confection is simpler than may be sup- 
posed from its elaborate appearance, it requires 
chiefly care, precision, and attention. Clarify 
two pounds of white sugar ; to ascertain when it 
is of a proper consistency, drop a spoonful in 
cold water, form it into a ball, and try if it sounds 
when struck against a glass; when it is thus 
tested, take the yolks of twenty eggs, mix them 
up gently and pass them through a sieve, then 
have ready a funnel, the hole of which must be 
about the size of vermicelli; hold the funnel 
over the sugar, while it is boiling over a charcoal 
fire ; pour the eggs through, stirring the sugar 
all the time, and taking care to hold the funnel 
at such a distance from the sugar, as to admit of 



SWEET DISHES^ ETC. 115 

the egg dropping into it When the egg has 
been a few minutes in the sugar, it will be hard 
enough to take out with a silver fork, and must 
then be placed on a drainer; continue adding 
e^ to the boiling sugar till enough is obtained ; 
there should be previously prepared one pound 
of sweet almonds, finely pounded and boiled in 
sugar, clarified with orange flower-water only; 
place in a dish a layer of this paste, over which 
spread a layer of citron cut in thin slices, and 
then a thick layer of the egg prepared as above ; 
continue working thus in alternate layers till 
high enough to look handsome. It should be 
piled in the form of a cone, and the egg should 
form the last layer. It must then be placed in 
a gentle oven till it becomes a little set, and the 
last layer slightly crisp; a few minutes will 
effect this. It must be served in the dish in which 
it is baked, and is generally ornamented with 
myrtle and gold and silver leaf. 



SOLA T0LIÂ£ DO. 

Take one pound of butter, and warm it over 
the fire with a little milk, then put it into a pa^ 
with one pound of flour, six beaten eggs, a 



116 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

quarter of a pound of beaten sweet almonds, and 
two table-spoonsful of yeast ; make these ingre- 
dients into a light paste, and set it before the 
fire to rise ; then grease a deep dish, and place 
in a layer of the paste, then some egg prepared 
as for Bola d'Amor, then slices of citron, and a 
layer of egg marmalade, sprinkle each layer 
with cinnamon, and fill the dish with alternate 
layers. A rich pufi* paste should line the dish, 
which ought to be deep ; bake in a brisk oven, 
after which, sugar clarified with orange flour- 
water must be poured over till the syrup has 
thoroughly penetrated the Bola. 



A BOLA D HISPANIOLA. 

Take one pound and a half of flour, with three 
spoonsfiil of yeast, two ounces of fi-esh butter, 
one table spoonfiil of essence of lemon, eight 
eggs, and half a t^a-cup fiill of water, and make 
it into a light dough, set it to rise for about an 
hour, then roll it out and cut it into three 
pieces; have previously ready, a quarter of a 
pound of citron, and three quarters of a pound 
of orange and lemon peel, cut in thin slices, 
mixed with powdered sugar and cinnamon ; the 



SWEET DISHES^ ETC. 117 

Bola should be formed with the pieces of dough, 
layers of the finiit being placed between ; it 
should not be baked in a tin. Powdered sweet 
almonds and sugar, should be strewed over it 
before baking. 



SUPEEIOK EECEIPT FOR ALMOND PUDDING. 

Beat up the yolks of ten eggs, and the whites 
of seven; add half a pound of sweet almonds 
pounded finely, half a pound of white sugar, 
half an ounce of bitter almonds, and a table- 
spoonful of orange flower water, when thoroughly 
mixed, grease a dish, put in the pudding and 
bake in a brisk oven ; when done, strew powdered 
sugar over the top, or, which is exceedingly fine, 
pour over clarified sugar with orange flower 
water 



GERMAN OR SPANISH PUFFS. 

Put a quarter of a pound of firesh butter, and 
a tea-cup fiill of cold water into a saucepan,

roughly mixed, put it in a dish to cool, and then 



US SWEET DISHES, ETC 

add four well beaten eggs ; butter some cups, 
half fill them with the batter, bake in a quick 
oven and serve with clarified sugar. 



A LUCTION, OE A EACHAEL. 

Make a thin nouilles paste, cut into strips of 
about two inches wide, leave it to dry, then boil 
the strips 'in a little water, and drain through a 
cullender ; when the water is strained off, mix 
it with beaten eggs, white sugar, a little firesh 
butter, and grated lemon peel ; bake or boil in 
a shape lined vrith preserved cherries, when 
turned out pour over a fine custard, or cream, 
flavored with brandy, and sweetened to taste. 



PEENESAS. 

Take one pint of milk, stir in as much flour as 
will bring it to the consistency of hasty pudding ; 
boil it till it becomes thick, let it cool, and beat 
it up with ten eggs; when smooth, take a spoon- 
ful at a time, and drop it into a frying-pan, in 
which there is a good quantity of boiling clarified 
butter, fry of a light brown, and serve with 
clarified sugar, flavored with lemon essence.

SOPA D'oRO : OR GOLDEN SOUP. 

Clarify a pound of sugar in a quarter of a pint 
of water, and the same quantity of orange flower- 
water; cut into pieces the size of dice a thin 
slice of toasted bread, or cut it into shapes with 
a paste cutter, throw it, while hot, into the sugar, 
with an ounce of sweet almonds pounded very 
finely, then take the beaten yolks of four eggs. 
Pour over the sugar and bread, stir gently, and 
let it simmer a few minutes. Serve in a deep 
glass dish, sprinkled over with pounded cin- 
namon. 

POMMES FRITE8. 

This is a simple but very nice way of pre- 
paring apples. Peel and cut five fine apples in 
half, dip them in egg and white powdered sugar, 
and fiy in butter ; when done, strew a little 
white sugar over them. 



CHE JADO s.

water ; peel and grate a moderately sized cocoa 
nut, add it to the syrup, and let it simmer till 



120 SWEET DISHES^ ETC. 

perfectly soft, putting rose water occasionally to 
prevent its becoming too dry ; stir it continually 
to prevent burning. Let it cool, and mix it 
with the beaten yolks of six eggs ; make a thin 
nouilles pastry, cut it into rounds of the size of 
a tea-cup ; pinch up the edges deep enough to 
form a shape, fill them with the sweet meat, 
and bake of a light brovm. A rich puff paste 
may be substituted for the nouilles pastry if 
preferred. 



COCOA NUT DOCE. 

This is merely the cocoa nut and sugar pre- 
pared as above, without egg, and served in small 
glasses, or baked. 



COCOA NUT PUDDING. 

Take about half a pound of finely grated cocoa 
nut ; beat up to a cream half a pound of fresh 
butter, add it to the cocoa nut, with half a pound 
of white sugar, and six whites of eggs beaten to 
a froth ; mix the whole well together, and bake 
in a dish lined with a rich puff paste. 



SWEET DISHES, ETC. 121 



EGG MARMALADE. 



Clarify one pound of sugar in half a pint of 
water till it becomes a thick syrup. While cla- 
rifying, add one ounce of sweet almonds blanched 
and pounded ; let it cool, and stir in gently the 
yolks of twenty eggs which ha/e been previously 
beaten and passed through a sieve ; great care 
must be taken to stir it continually the same 
way ; when well mixed, place it over a slow 
fire till it thickens, stirring all the time to pre- 
vent burning. Some cooks add vanilla, con- 
sidering the flavor an improvement. 



M ACK OTES. 

Take one pound of French roll dough, six 
ounces of firesh butter, two eggs, and as much 
flour as will be requisite to knead it together ; 
roll in into the form of a long French roll, and 
cut it in thin round slices; set them at a short 
distance from the fiire to rise, and then fry in 
the best Florence oil; when nearly cold, dip 
them in clarified sugar, flavored with essence of 
lemon. 



122 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

TART DE MOY. 

Soak three-quarters of a pound of savoy 
biscuits in a quart of milk; add six ounces of 
fresh butter, four eggs, one ounce of candid 
orange peel, the same quantity of lemon peel, 
and one ounce of citron, mix all well together ; 
sweeten with white sugar, and bake in a quick 
oven ; when nearly done, spread over the top 
the whites of the eggs well whisked, and return 
it to the oven. 



GRIMSTICH. 

Make into a stiff paste one pint of biscuit 
powder, a little brown sugar, grated lemon peel, 
six eggs, and three-quarters of a pound of 
warmed fresh butter ; then prepare four apples 
chopped finely, a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds blanched and chopped, half a pound of 
stoned raisins, a little nutmeg grated, half a 
pound of coarse brown sugar, and a glass of 
white wine, or a Uttle brandy ; mix the above 
ingredients together, and put them on a slow 
fire to simmer for half an hour, and place in a 
dish to cool ; make the paste into the form of 
small dumplings, fill them with the firuit, and 



SWEET DISHES, ETC. 123 

bake them ; when put in the oven, pour over a 
syrup of brown sugar and water, flavored with 
lemon juice. 



FRENCH ROLL FRITTERS. 

Take off the crust of a long round French roll ; 
cut the crumb in thin slices, soak them in boiling 
milk, taking care they do not break ; have a dish 
ready with several eggs beaten up, and with a 
fish slice remove the bread from the milk, letting 
the milk drain off, dip them into the dish of 
eggs, and half fry them in fine salad oil, they 
must then be again soaked in the milk and 
dipped the egg, and then fided of a handsome 
light brown ; while hot, pour over clarified 
sugar, flavored with cinnamon and orange flower 
water. 



HAM an' 8 FRITTERS. 

Take two spoonful of the best Florence oil, 
scald it, and when hot, mix with it one poimd 
of flour, add four beaten eggs and make it into 
a paste, roll it out thin and cut it into pieces 
about four inches square, let them dry and fry 
them in oil ; the moment the pieces are put in 



124 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

the frying pan, they must be drawn up with two 
silver skewers into different forms according to 
fancy ; a few minutes is sufficient to fry them, 
they should be crisp when done. 



WAFLERS. 

Mix a cup and a half of thick yeast with a 
little warm milk, and set it with two pounds of 
flour before the fire to rise, then mix with them

water, a little powdered cinnamon, and three 
pints of warm milk ; when the batter is perfectly 
smooth, butter the irons, fill them with it, close 
them down tightly, and put them between the

ding required, and the taste of the family she 
serves. 



MINCED MEAT. 

Take one pound of tender roasted meat, two 
pounds of shred suet, three pounds of currants, 
six chopped apples, a quarter of a loaf grated, 
nutmegs, cloves, pepper, salt, one pound of 
sugar, grated lemon and orange peel, lemon juice, 
and two wine glasses of brandy, the same of 
white wine, and two ounces of citron, and the 
same of candied lemon peel; mix all well 
together; the ingredients ought to be added 
separately. Minced meat should be kept a 
day or two before using. The same proportions, 
as above, without meat, will be very good ; a 
litde port wine is sometimes substituted for the 
brandy. 



BAKED SUET PUDDING. 

Mix one pint of water, six oimces of flour, 
three of shred suet, and two or three beaten 
eggs ; sweeten to taste. Add raisins or currants 
if approved, and bake in a brick oven. 



138 SWEET DI8HE8, ETC. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Mix into a smooth batter half a pound of 
flour, four eggs, if intended to be rich, otherwise 
two, a pint of milk, and a little salt, it should 
be about an inch thick ; it can be made with or 
without milk by using a greater proportion of 
eggs, but it is not so good. 



GATEAU DE TOURS. 

Take a pound-cake, cut it in slices about half 
an inch in thickness, spread each slice with jam 
or preserve, then replace them to the original 
form ; cover the cake with whites of eggs and 
sugar, whisked to a froth, and set it in a cool 
oven to dry. 

JAUMANGE. 

Simmer half a pound of white sugar in three- 
quarters of a pint of water, with the thinly cut 
peel of two lemons ; when the sugar is melted, 
add an ounce of dissolved isinglass, and the juice 
of three lemons, a glass of brandy and three of 
sherry, beat up with this the yolks of five or 



SWEET DI8HEB, ETC. 139 

six eggs. Place the basin in which it is mixed 
into a pan of boiling water to thicken it, then 
pour it into a mould and set it to cool ; if it 
does not thicken by being put in a pan of boil- 
ing water, set the pan on the fire and stir it 
for a few minutes. 



OATEAU DÂ£ POMMIU 

Take ten or twelve fine baking apples, peel 
and take out the cores, and let them simmer in 
milk and water; when soft drain them, and beat 
them up with a wooden fork, with half an ounce of 
dissolved isinglass, white sifted sugar, sufiicient 
to sweeten, and grated lemon peel. Put the 
mixture, when perfectly smooth, into a mould, 
set it in ice or a very cool place, when it is 
turned out it should be covered with a fine 
custard. 



APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

Prepare the apples as in the last receipt ; but 
instead of using a jelly mould, put the apples into 
an oval cake tin about the size of a small side dish, 
four or five inches high; when cold, turn it out 



140 SWEET DISHES^ ETC. 

and cover the apple-shape with savoy cakes 
placed closely together perpendicularly; all round 
the top of the charlotte should be covered with 
whites of eggs and sugar, beaten to a stiff froth, 
and placed in small balls ; a salamander should 
be used to crisp them and to give a slight 
peach-like colour; a tasteful cook will, after 
crisping the first layer of these balls, add others 
over them to form a sort of cone high in the 
centre, that will have a pretty effect if well 
done. This is an easy and elegant entremity 
and by no means an expensive one. 



A SOUFLE. 

Take half a pint of cream and the same 
quantity of new milk, and warm them together 
in a clean saucepan, meanwhile make a smooth 
batter with four ounces of rice-flour or potatoe- 
flour, and stir into the milk, let it simmer, 
stirring all the time till it thickens ; then add 
two to three ounces of fresh butter, and white 
sifted sugar enough to sweeten, and a little 
grated lemon peel ; then take it off the fire and 
stir quickly to it the well-beaten yolks of six 
to eight eggs, butter the pan and pour the 



SWEET DISHES, ETC. 141 

mixture into it, when on the point of being 
placed into the oven, add the whites of the 
eggs thoroughly whisked; the pan must be only 
half filled, as it will rise very high ; it must be 
served immediately it is taken from the oven, 
even in passing to the dinner table a salamander 
should be held over it, to prevent its falling and 
becoming heavy and unsightly. The French 
flavour a soufl6 with orange flour-water or 
vanilla, and the rind of a Seville orange is some- 
times substituted for the rind of a lemon ; there 
are dishes made expressly for soufl^s. 



A PLAIN SOUFLE. 

Mix well together six ounces of rice-flour, 
arrowroot, or taus les mois, with half a pint of 
milk flavoured with essence of almond and 
lemon peel, or orange-flour water, let it thicken 
over the fire, stirring to keep it smooth, sweeten 
with white sugar, add the beaten yolks of five 
e^s, proceed as in the last receipt, adding the 
whisked whites at the moment of placing the 
soufl6 into the oven ; if there happen to be no 
soufl6 dish, a cake-tin may make a tolerable 
substitute, a paper firinged should then line thf 



142 8WEET DISHES, ETC. 

tin and a napkin should be twisted round it 
when brought to table. 



A 8WXET OMELET* 

Beat up three or four eggs, pour them into 
an omelet pan, and sprinkle a little white sugar 
over them while frying, hold a salamander or 
hot shovel over the uppermost side of the omelet, 
as it must only be firied on one side. As soon 
as it is set, sUde it on to a hot dish, double it, 
and sprinkle sugar over it and serve quickly. 



OMLETTE SOUFLEE. 

Fry the eggs as directed for sweet omelet, 
using about five yolks and two whites, all of 
which require being finely beaten and strained. 
Soften a little preserve by holding it over the 
fire, or mixing a little warm water with it, 
spread it slightly over the omelette, have the 
remainder of the whites whisked to a fix>th with 
white sugar, and lay it on the preserve; slide the 
omelette on to a hot dish, double it, and serve 
directly. 



SWEET DISHES^ ETC. 143 

FANCY CREAMS. 

Put into a basin a pint of cream, to which 
add four ounces of powdered white sugar, and 
the rind of a lemon rubbed on a lump of sugar, 
and a glass of sherry wine ; whisk them well 
and mix with it half an ounce of dissolved 
isinglass, beat it all thoroughly together, and fill 
the mould, which should be set in ice till 
wanted. A table spoonful of marasquino added 
to the above, will make Italian cream, A 
table spoonful of fresh or preserved pine-apple 
will make pineapple cream ; this will require the 
addition of a little lemon syrup. A table spoon- 
ful of ratafia, will make it roMfia cream. 

The juice of strawberries or raspberries make 
fine firuit creams ; mille fruit cream is made by 
mixing with the cream any kind of small pre- 
served fiiiit 



RICE SOUFLES. 

Boil well some fine picked rice, in pure firesh 
milk, sweeten and flavour with a bay leaf, lemon 
peel, and a stick of cinnamon, all which must 
be taken out when the rice is done, then line 



144 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

with it a round dish, or soufl6 dish, have ready 
apples previously boiled, sweetened, and beat 
up smoothly, place the apple lightly in the 
centre rather higher in the middle than at the ' 
sides, beat up the whites of eg^ to a froth, 
sweeten and flavour with lemon, or noyau 
essence; place it in small heaps tastefully on 
the apple and rice, and brown delicately with 
a salamander. This soufl6 may have stewed 
cherries or any other kind of fruit, instead of the 
apples if preferred. 



BOILED CUSTARD. 

Take a pint of milk, let it simmer in a very 
clean saucepan, flavor it with lemon-peel and a 
bay leaf, and sweeten to taste; while gendy 
boiling, add the beaten yolks of four eggs, and 
the whites of two, continue stirring until the 
custard thickens, when it must be removed 
from the fire, but it is requisite to stir it until 
it cools. It is necessary to strain the milk 
before the eggs are added, and also to pass the 
eggs through a sieve. Custards are flavoured 
sometimes with essence of almonds; a little 
cream added to the milk is a great improvement 



SWEET DISHESj ETC. 145 

The above mixture may be baked in small 
cups; they require a quarter of an hour to 
bake. 



calb's fset jelly. 
Boil twa feet in two quarts^ or five pmts of 
watery till the water has half wasted ; strain, and 
when cold, take off the &t, then put it in the 
saucepan with lump sugar, lemon juice, and 
white wine to taste, also a little leBoon peel; 
when simmered a few minutes, throw in the 
wbj^tes of two. eggs, and their shells broken, 
whi^h will have the e&ct of clarifying the jelly ; 
let it boil about ten minutes after the scum 
rii^fes^ then pour it through a flannel bag or 
thick cloth, dipping the bag or cloth first into 
hot water; pass the jelly through it until clear, 
th^en pour it into moulds and put them in a cool 
plape to set One calf s foot and one cow heel 
will be mare economical than two calf s feetÂ« 
K fruijt is desired to be in the jelly, it must be 
put in when the jelly begins to stiffen in the 



146 SWEET DISHES, ETC. 

OEANGE JELLY. 

This can be made with cairs feet or withoutr 
One quart of water will require one ounce 
of isinglass, simmer the isinglass in the water, 
and add the peel of one lemon and one orange ; 
when the isinglass is dissolved, add the juice of 
a lemon and six fine oranges; although the 
quantity must vary according to the season for 
them, sweeten with half a pound of white sugar; 
a Seville orange is added if there should not be 
much flavor in the others. 

Lemon jelly is made in the same way ; the 
peel of a Seville orange and of a lemon is used, 
with the juice of five lemons; rather more 
sugar will be required with this jelly than with 
the former. 

Punch jelly is made in the same way. An 
equal quantity of brandy and rum, with the 
juice of two or three lemons is mixed with the 
isinglass, which is dissolved in one pint of 
water, the other pint of liquid being made up 
by the lemon juice and spirits. 

The essence of noyeau is reckoned to give 
an exquisite flavor, in this case it requires to 
be coloured with a few drops of cochineal. 



SWEET DISHES, ETC. 147

sometimes spread over the cakes ; a fine light 
firoth is prepared, with cream and the whites of 
two eggs, flavored with wine and sugar, heap 
it over the trifle lightly*

thickness of one inch, and cut two pieces with 
the larger tin cutter, then presg the smaller cut- 
ter tiirough one of these pieces, and remove the 
border which will be formed round it; this must 
be laid very evenly upon the other piece of paste, 
and slightly pressed to make it adhere ; place the 
tourte in an oven to bake for about twenty 
minutes, then let it become cool, but not cold, 
and fill it with a fine custard or with any rich

SWEET MEATS, ETC. 159 

together, and poured over the eggs after they 
have been well whisked, which must be con- 
tinued while the liquid is being poured over 
them, and until they become quite thick and 
white, then stir in the flour, which must be warm 
and dry. Pour the mixture into a couple of 
cake tins, and bake in a gentle oven. 



A NICE BREAKFAST CAKE. 

Make a paste of half a pound of flour, one

cut in half, buttered hot, and served quickly. 



ICING FOE CAKES. 

Whisk half a pound of sifted white sugar, 
with one wine glass of orange flower-water, and 
the whites of two eggs, well beaten and strained ;

CHAPTER VIIL 



Attention and a little practice will ensure ex- 
cellence in such preserves as are in general use 
in private families ; and it will always be found 
a more economical plan to purchase the more 
rare and uncommon articles of preserved fixiite 
than to have them made at home. 

The more sugar that is added to fruit the less 
boiling it requires. 

K jellies be over-boiled, much of the sugar 
will become candied, and leave the jelly thin. 

Every thing used for the purpose of preserving 
should be clean and very dry, particularly bot- 
tles for bottled fruit 

Fruit should boil rapidly before the sugar is 



162 PRESERVING AND BOTTLING* 

added, and quiedy afterwards â when preserves 
seem likely to become mouldy, it is generally a 
sign they have not been sufficiently boiled, and 
it will be requisite to boil them up again â ^fruit 
for bottling should not be too ripe, and should 
be perfectly fresh; there are various methods 
adopted by diflFerent cooks: the fruit may be 
placed in the bottles, and set in a moderate oven 
until considerably shrunken, when the bottles 
should be removed and closely corked ; or the 
bottles may be set in a pan with cold water up 
to the necks, placed over the fire ; when the 
fixiit begins to sink remove them, and when cold 
fill up each bottle with cold spring water, cork 
the bottles, and lay them on their sides in a dry 
place. 

To bottle red currantsâ pick them carefiilly 
from the stalk, and add, as the currants are put 
in, sifted white sugar ; let the bottles be well 
filled and rosin the corks, and keep them with 
their necks downwards. 



BRANDIED CHERRIES. 

Put into a large wide mouthed bottle very ripe 
black cherries, add to them two pounds of loaf 



PRESERVING AND BOTTLINO. 163 

^xigar, a quart of brandy, and a few cloves, then 
bruise a few more cherries, and simmer with 
sugar, strain and add the juice to the cherries in 
the bottle, cork closely, and keep in a warm dry 
place. 

(atJINCE MARMALADE. 

Peel, cut into quarters, and core two pounds 
of sharp apples, and the same quantity of 
quinces ; put them into a jar, with one pound 
of white sugar powdered and sprinkled over 
them ; cover them with half a pint of water, and 
put in also a little bruised cochineal tied in a 
muslin. Set them in a slack oven till tender, 
take out the cochineal, and pulp the fruit to a 
marmalade. 

Some cooks prefer boiling the sugar and water 
first and scalding the fruit till tender, and then 
adding them to the syrup. 

DAMSON MARMALADE. 

Is made in the same manner as quince, as 
also apricot marmalade, which is very fine ; the 
fruit must be stoned, and some of the kernels 
put in with the fruit, which are peeled, and 



164 PRESERVING AND BOTTLING. 

apricots are cut in pieces; they should be care- 
fully pulped through a clean sieve. 



PRESERVED APRICOTS. 

Halve and pare ripe apricots, or if not quite 
ripe, boil them till the skin can easily be re- 
moved. Lay them in a dish hollow downwards, 
sift over them their own weight of white sugar, 
let them lay for some hours, then put the finit, 
with the sugar and juice into a preserving pan, 
and simmer till the fruit is clear, take it out, 
put it carefully into pots, and pour over the 
syrup. 

This receipt will serve as a guide for preserved 
nectarines, peaches, plums, gages, &c. A few 
of the kernels should always be put in with the 
fruit, as they improve the flavor of the preserve. 



STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED WHOLE. 

Weigh an equal quantity of fruit and white 
sugar powdered, sift all the sugar over the fruit, 
so that half of it shall equally be covered, let it 
lay till the next day, when boil the remainder 



PRESERVING AND BOTTLma. 165 

vrith red currant juice, in which simmer the 
strawberries until the jelly hangs about them. 
Put the strawberries into pots, taking care not 
to break them, and pour over the syrup. 

This receipt will serve for raspberries and 
cherries, which make a fine preserve. 



STRAWBEEEY JAM. 

Bruise gently, with the back of a wooden 
spoon, six pounds of fine firesh finiit, and boil 
them with very little water for twenty minutes, 
stirring until the fi-uit and juice are well mixed ; 
then put in powdered loaf sugar of equal 
weight to the fiiiit, and simmer half an hour 
longer. If the preserve is not required to be 
very rich, half the weight of sugar in proportion 
to the quantity of finiit may be used ; but more 
boiling will be requisite. By this recipe also 
are made raspberry, currant, gooseberry, apricot, 
and other jams. 



RED CURRANT JELLY. 

Strip carefiilly fi:om the stems some quite 
ripe currants, put them into a preserving pan> 



166 PRESERVING AND BOTTLING. 

stir them gendy over a clear fire until the juice 
flows freely fi:om them, then squeeze the cur- 
rants and strain the juice through a folded 
muslin or jelly bag ; pour it into a preserving 
pan, adding, as it boils, white sugar, in the pro- 
portion of one pound of sugar to one pint of 
juice. 

If made with less sugar, more boiling will be 
required, by which much juice and flavour are 
lost. A little dissolved isinglass is used by 
confectioners, but it is much better without. 
Jams and jellies should be poured into pots 
when in a boiling state. 

Jellies should be continually skimmed till the 
scum ceases to rise, so that they may be clear 
and fine. White currant jelly and black are 
made in the same manner as red. By this 
receipt can be made raspberry jelly, strawberry 
jelly, and all other kinds. 



APPLE JELLY. 

Pare, core, and cut small any kind of fine 
baking apples â say six pounds in weight ; put 
them in a preserving pan with one quart of 



PBESERVING AND BOTTLING. 167 

water; boil gently till the apples are very soft 
and broken^ then pass the juice through a jelly 
bag ; when^ to each pint, add half a pound of 
loaf sugar, set it on the fire to boil twenty 
minutes, skimn^pg it as the scum rises ; it must 
not be over boiled, or the colour will be too 
darL 



PEAE-SYBUP OE JELLY. 

This preparation, although littie known in 
England, forms an important article of economy 
in many parts of the Continent. The pears 
are first heated in a saucepan over the fire until 
the pulp, skins, &c., have separated firom the 
juice, which is then strained, and boiled with 
coarse brown sugar to the thickness of treacle ; 
but it has a far more agreeable flavour. It is 
cheaper than butter or treacle, and is excellent 
spread upon bread for children. 



PLUM JAM. 

This is a useful and cheap preserve. Choose 
the large long black plum; to each gallon of 



168 PRESERVING AND BOTTLING. 

which add three pounds of good moist sugar ; 
bake them till they begin to crack, when, put 
them in pots, of a size for once using, as the air 
is apt to spoil the jam. 



169 



CHAPTER IX. 
|llickltn0. 



The best vinegar should always be used for 
pickling; in all cases it should be boiled and 
strained. 

The articles to be pickled should first be par- 
boiled or soaked in brine^ which should have 
about six ounces of salt to one quart of water. 

The spices used for pickling are whole pepper, 
long peppers, allspice, mace, mustard-seed, and 
ginger, the last being first bruised. 

The following is a good proportion of spice : 
to one quart of vinegar put half an ounce of 
ginger, the same quantity of whole-pepper and 
allspice, and one ounce of mustard-seed ; four 
shalots, and one clove of garlic. 



170 PICKLING. 

Pickles should be kept secure from the air, or 
they soon become soft; the least quantity of 
water, or a wet spoon, put into a jar of pickles, 
will spoil the contents. 



TO PICKLE GHEEKINS AND FRENCH BEANS. 

These are, of all vegetables, the most difficult 
to pickle, so that their green colour and fresh- - 
ness may be preserved. Choose some fine fresh 
gherkins, and set them to soak in brine for a 
week ; then drain them, and pour over boiling 
vinegar, prepared with the usual spices, first 
having covered them with fresh vine leaves. K 
they do not appear to be of a fine green, pour 
off the vinegar, boil it up again, cover the 
gherkins with fi^sh green vine leaves, and pour 
over the vinegar again. French beans are 
pickled exactly the same. 



TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWEES. 

Remove the stalks and leaves, break the 
flower into pieces, parboil them in brine, then 
drain them, and lay them in a jar, and pour 
over boiling spiced vinegar. 



PICKLING. 171 

TO PICKLE MELON MANGOES. 

Cut the melons in half, remove the pulpy 
part and the seeds, soak the halves for a week in 
strong brine, then fill them with the usual 
spices, mustard-seed and garlic, and tie them 
together with packthread; put them in jars, 
and pour over boiling spiced vinegar. Lai^e 
cucumbers may be pickled in the same way. 



PICCALILI. 

Pickle gherkins, French beans, and cauli- 
flower, separately, as already directed ; the other 
vegetables used are carrots, onions, capsicums, 
white cabbage, celery, and, indeed almost any 
kind may be put into this pickle, except wal- 
nuts and red cabbage. They must be cut in 
small pieces, and soaked in brine, the carrots 
only, requiring to be boiled in it to make them 
tender ; then prepare a liquor as follows : into 
half a gallon of vinegar put two oimces of 
ginger, one of whole black pepper, one of whole 
allspice, and one of bruised chillies, three 
ounces of shalots, and one ounce of garUc ; boil 
together nearly twenty minutes; mix a little of it 



172 PICKLIXG. 

in a basin^ with two ounces of flour of mustard 
and one ounce of turmeric^ and stir it in grar 
dually with the rest ; then pour the liquor oyer 
the vegetables. 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. 

Choose small button mushrooms, clean and 
wipe them, and throw them into cold water, 
then put into a stewpan with a littie salt, and 
cover them with distilled vinegar, and simmer a 
few minutes. Put them in bottles with a couple 
of blades or so of mace, and when cold, cork 
them closely. 



TO PICKLE OXIOXS. 

Choose all of a size and soak in boiling brine, 
when cold, drain them and put them in bottles, 
and fill up with hot distilled vinegar; if they 
are to be white, use white wine vin^ar; if they 
are to be brown, use the best distilled vin^ar, 
adding, in both cases, a littie mace, ginger, and 
whole pepper. 

TO PICKLE WHITE AXD RED CABBAGE. 

Take ofl" the outside leaves, cut out tiie stalk, 
and shred the cabbage into a cullender, sprinkle 



PICKLING. 173 

with salt, let it remain for twenty-four hours, 
then drain it Put it into jars, and fill up with 
boiling vinegar, prepared with the usual spices ; 
if the cabbage is red, a Uttle cochineal powdered, 
or a slice or two of beet-root is necessary to 
make the pickle a fine colour ; if it is white cab- 
bage, add instead, a httle turmeric powder. 



TO PICKLE WALNUTS. 

Soak in brine for a week, prick them, and 
simmer in brine, then let them lay on a sieve to 
drain, and to turn black, after which place them 
in jars, and pour over boiling spiced vindgar. 



AN OLD WAY OF PICKLING CUCUMBERS. 

Cut the cucumbers in small pieces, length 
ways, with the peel left on ; lay them in salt for 
twenty-four hours, then dry the pieces with a 
cloth, lay them in a deep dish, and pour over 
the following mixture: some vinegar boiled 
with cayenne pepper, whole ginger, a little 
whole pepper, and mustard seed, a few West 
India pickles are by some considered an im- 



174 PICKLING. 

provement This mixture should stand till 
nearly cold before covering the cucumbers, 
which should then be bottled. This pickle is 
fit for eating a few days after it is made, and will 
also keep good in a dry place as long as may be 
required. 



175 



CHAPTER X. 
lAtctxfU for Jnoalilie* 



BEEP TEA. 

Cut one pound of fleshy beef in dice, or thin 
slices, simmer for a short time without water, to 
extract the juices, then add, by degrees, one 
quart of water, a Uttle salt, a piece of lemon 
peel, and a sprig of parsley, are the only neces- 
sary seasonings ; if the broth is required to be 
stronger put less water. 



CHICKEN PANADA. 

Boil a chicken till rather more than half 
done in a quart of water, take of the skin, cut 
ofl^ the white parts when cold, and pound it to 
a paste in a mortar, with a small quantity of 



176 RECEIPTS FOR INVALIDS 

the liquor it was boiled in, season with salt, 
a little nutmeg, and the least piece of lemon 
peel: boil it gently, and make it with the 
liquor in which the fowl has been boiled of 
the required consistency. It should be rather 
thicker than cream. 



CHICKEN BROTH. 

After the white parts have been removed for the 
panada, return the rest of the chicken to the 
saucepan, with the liquid, add one blade of mace, 
one slice only of onion, a litde salt, and a piece 
of lemon peel ; carefully remove every particle 
of fat Vermicelli is very well adapted for this 
broth. 



RESTGRATR-E JELLIES. 
There are various kinds of simple restorative 
jelUes suited to an invalid, among the best are 
the following : â 

HARTSHORN JELLY. 

Boil half a pound of hartshorn shavings in 
two quarts of water over a gentle fire until it 



BBCJbiix-AO xkjA invalids. 177 

becomes thick enough to hang about a spoon^ 
then strain it into a dean saucepan and add half 
a pint of sherry wine, and a quarter of a pound 
of white sugar, clear it by stirring in the whites 
of a couple of eggs, whisked to a firoth; boil it 
for about four or five minutes, add the juice of 
three lemons, and stir dl together, when it is well 
curdled, strain it and pour into the mould, if the 
color is. required to be deeper than the wine will 
make.it, a little saflron may be boiled in it. 



BARLEY JELLY. 

Boil i:. Â£.n iron saucepan, one tea-cup full of 
pearl barley, with one quart of cold water, pour 
off the water when it boils, and add another 
quart, let it simmer very gently for three hours 
over or near a slow fire, stirring it fi'equently 
with a wooden spoon, strain it, and sweeten with 
white sugar, add the juice of a lemon, a little 
white wine, and a quarter of an ounce of isin- 
glass dissolved in a little water, and pour it 
into a mould. This is a very nourishing jelly. 



178 BECEIPTS FOR INVAUM. 

CAUDLE. 

Make a fine smooth gruel of grits^ with a 
few spices boiled in it, strain it carefully and 
warm as required, adding white wine and a 
little brandy, nutmeg, lemon peel, and sugar, 
according to taste, some persons put the yolk 
of an egg. 



RICE CAUDLE. 



Boil half a pint of milk, add a spoonfiil of 
ground rice mixed with a little milk till quite 
smooth, stir it into the boiling milk, let it simmer 
till it thickens, carefully straining it, and sweeten 
with white sugar. 



BAKLEY MILK. 

Boil half a pound of pearl barley in one 
quart of new milk, taking care to parboil it first 
in water, which must be poured off, sweeten with 
white sugar. This is better made with pearl 
barley than the prepared barley. 



RECEIPTS FOR INVALIDS. 179 

RESTORATIVE MILK. 

Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass in a pint 
of new milk till reduced to half, and sweeten 
with sugar candy. 



MILK PORRIDGE. 

Make a fine gruel with new milk without add- 
ing any water, strain it when sufficiently thick, 
and sweeten with white sugar. This is extremely 
nutritive and fattening. 

WINE WHEY. 

Set on the fire in a saucepan a pint of milk, 
when it boils, pour in as much white wine as 
will turn it into curds, boil it up, let the curds 
settle, strain ofi^, and add a little boiling water, 
and sweeten to taste. 



TAMARIND WHEY. 

Boil three ounces of tamarinds in two pints of 
milk, strain ofi^ the curds, and let it cool. This 
is a very refreshing drink. 



180 RECEIPTS FOR INVALmS. 



PLAIN WHEY. 



Put into boiling milk as much lemon juice or 
vinegar as will turn it, and make the milk clear, 
strain, add hot water, and sweeten. 



ORGEAT. 



Beat three ounces of almonds with a table-Â«poon- 
fill of orange-flour water, and one bitter almond; 
then pour one pint of new milk, and one pint of 
water to the paste, and sweeten with sifted white 
sugar ; half an ounce of gum-arabic is a good 
addition for those who have a tender chest 



IRISH MOSS. 

Boil half an ounce of carrageen or Irish moss, 
in a pint and a half of water or milk till it is re- 
duced to a pint ; it is a most excellent drink for 
delicate persons or weakly children. 



A FINE SOFT DRINK FOR A COUGH. 

Add to a quarter of a pint of new milk warmed. 



RECEIPTS FOR INVALIDS. 181 

a beaten new laid egg, with a spoonful of capil- 
laire, and the same of rose water. 



â² REFRESHING DRINK. 

Cut four large apples in slices, and pour over 
a quart of boiling water, let them stand till cold, 
strain the liquor, and sweeten with white sugar ; 
a little lemon peel put with the apples improves 
the flavour. 

A VERT FINS EMMOUENT DRINK. 

Wash and rinse extremely well one ounce of 
pearl barley, then put to it one ounce of sweet 
almonds beaten fine, and a piece of lemon peel, 
boil together till the liquor is of the thickness of 
cream and perfectly smooth, then put in a Uttle 
syrup of lemon and capillaire. 



â² COOLING DRINK IN FEVER. 

Put a little tea-sage, and a couple of sprigs of 
bahn into a jug, with a lemon thinly sliced, and 
the peel cut into strips, pour over a quart of 
boiling water, sweeten and let it cooL

APPENDIX. 



FKENCH METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE. 

Take in the proportion of one ounce of the berries 
to half a pint of water, and grind them at the in- 
stant of using them. Put the powder into a coffee 
biggin, press it down closely, and pour over a 
little water sufficient to moisten it, and then add 
the remainder by degrees ; the water must be 
perfectly boiling all the time; let it nm quite 
through before the top of the percolator is taken 
off, it must be served with an equal quantity of 
boiling milk. Coffee made in this manner is 
much clearer and better flavored than when 
boiled, and it is a much more economical 
method than boiling it 

A PEENCH EEGEIPT FOE MAKING CHOCOlATE. 

Take one ounce of chocolate, cut it in small 
pieces, and boil it about six or seven minutes 



APPENDIX. 183 

with a small teacup full of water ; stir it till 
smooth, then add nearly a pint of good milk, 
give it another boil, stirring or milling it well, 
and serve directly. If required very thick, a 
larger proportion of chocolate must be used. 

EGG WINE. 

Beat a fresh egg, and add it to a tumbler of 
whitfe tdne and water, sweetened and spiced; 
set it on the fire, stir it gently one way until it 
thickens ; this, with toast, forms a light nutritive 
supper. 

MULLED WINE. 

Boil a little spice, cinnamon, ginger, and 
cloves, in water, till the flavor is gained, then 
add wine, as much as may be approved, sugar 
and nutmeg ; a strip or two of orange rind cut 
thin will be found a great improvement 



TO MAKE PUNCH. 

To make one quart, provide two fine fresh 
lemons, and rub off the outer peel upon a few 
lumps of sugar ; put the sugar into a bowl with 



184 APPENDIX. 

four ounces of powdered sugar^ upon which 
press the juice of the lemons^ and pour over one 
pint and a half of very hot water that has not 
boiled^ then add a quarter of a pint of rum^ and 
the same quantity of brandy; stir well to- 
gether and strain it^ and let it stand a few 
minutes before it is drank. 

Whiskey punch is made after the same me- 
thod; the juice and thin peel of a Seville orange 
add variety of flavor to punchy particularly 
of whiskey punch. 



MILK PUNCH. 

Put into a quart of new milk the thinly pared 
rind of a lemon, and four oimces of lump sugar ; 
let it boil slowly, remove the peel, and stir in 
the yolks of two eggs, previously mixed with a 
little cold milk ; add by degrees a tearcup full 
of rum, the same of brandy ; mill the punch to 
a fine firoth, and serve immediately in quite 
warm glasses. The punch must not be allowed 
to boil after the eggs have been added. 



APPENDIX. J 85 

A FRENCH PLUM PIE. 

Stew one pound of fine dried French plums 
until tender, in water, rather more than enough 
to cover, with one glass of port wine, and four 
ounces of white sugar, which must however not 
be added until the plums are quite tender, then 
pour them with the liquor into a pie-dish, and 
cover with a rich pufi^ paste, and bake. 

BOASTED CHESNUTS FOB DESSEBTS. 

Chestnuts are so firequently sent to table un- 
eatable, that we will give the French receipt for 
them. They should be first boiled for five 
minutes, and then finish them in a pan over the 
fire ; they will after the boiling require exactly 
fiftteen minutes roasting; the skin must be 
slightly cut before they are cooked. 



TO ROAST PABTRIDGES AND PHEASANTS. 

They may be either piqu^ or not ; partridges 
require roasting rather more than half an hour, 
pheasants three-quarters, if small, otherwise an 
hour; they are served with bread sauce. 

Partridges may be stewed as pigeons. 



186 APPENDIX. 

TO ROAST VENISON. 

Wipe the venison dry, Sprinkle with salt, 
^nd cover with writing paper rubbed with cla- 
rified fat ; cover this with a thick paste made of 
flour and water, round which, tie with packthre^ 
white kitchen paper, so as to prevent the paste 
coming off; set the venison before a strong fire, 
and baste it directly and continue imtil it is 
nearly done, then remove the paper, paste, &c. ; 
draw the venison nearer the fire, dredge it with 
flour, and continue basting ; it should only take 
a light brown, and should be rather under than 
over-done ; a large haunch requires fi:om three 
to four hours roasting, a small one not above 
three. Serve with the knuckle, garnished with 
a fiinge of white paper, and with gravy attid 
red currant jelly, either cold or melted, in .port 
wine, and served hot 



A VENISON PABTY. 

Having baked or boiled two iiours in broth, 
with a little seasoning, any part selected, cut the 
meat in pieces, season wiÂ£h cayenne pepper, salt, 
pounded mace, and a little allspice, place it into a 



APPENDIX. 187 

deep dish; lay over thin slices of mutton fat, 
and pour a little strong beef gravy flavored with 
port wine into the dish ; cover with a thick puff 
paste, and bake. 



SALMON PIE. 

Cut two pounds of fine firesh salmon in slices 
about three quarters of an inch thick, and set 
them aside on a dishy clean and scrape five or 
six anchovies and halve them, then chop a small 
pottle of mushrooms, a handfiil of firesh parsley, 
a couple of shalots, and a little green thyme. 
Put these together into a saucepan, with three 
ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, nutmeg, 
and tarragon ; add the juice of a lemon, and 
half a pint of good brown gravy, and let the 
whole simmer, gently stirring it all the time ; 
also slice six eggs boiled hard, then line a pie- 
dish with good short paste, and fill it with 
alternate layers of the slices of salmon, hard 
eggs, and fillets of anchovies, spreading between 
each layer the herb sauce, then cover the dish 
with the paste, and bake in a moderately heated 
oven. 



188 APPENDIX. 



CHICKEN PUDDING. 

Line a basin with a good beef- suet paste, and 
fill it with chickeni prepared in the following 
way: cut up a small chicken, 'ightly fry the 
pieces, then place them in a stew-pan, with thin 
slices of charissa, or, if at hand, slices of smoked 
veal, add enough good beef gravy to cover them ; 
season with mushroom essence or powder, pep- 
per, salt, and a very small quantity of nutmeg, 
and mace ; simmer gently for a quarter of an 
hour, and fill the pudding ; pour over part of 
the gravy and keep the rest to be poured over 
the pudding when served in the dish. The pud- 
ding, when filled, must be covered closely with 
the paste, the ends of which should be wetted 
with a paste brush to make it adhere closely. 



A FINE BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

Cut two pounds of beef steaks into large 
collops, fry them quickly over a brisk fire, 
then place them in a dish in two or three 
layers, strewing between each, salt, pepper, and 
mushroom powder ; pour over a pint of strong 



APPENDIX. 189 

broth, and a couple of table-spoonsful of 
Harvey-sauce; cover with a good beef suet 
paste^ and bake for a couple of hours. 

The most delicate manner of preparing suet 
for pastry is to clarify it, and use it as butter ; 
this will be found a very superior method Tor 
meat pastry. 



AN EAST RECEIPT FOR A CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Trim straitly about six oimces of savoy bis- 
cuits, so that they may fit closely to each other ; 
line the bottom and sides of a plain mould with 
them, then fill it with a fine cream made in the 
following manner: put into a stewpan three 
ounces of ratafias, six of sugar, the grated rind 
of half an orange, the same quantity of the rind 
of a lemon, a small piece of cinnamon, a wine- 
glass full of good maraschino, or fine noyeau, one 
pint of cream, and the well beaten yolks of six 
eggs ; stir this mixture for a few minutes over a 
stove fire, and then strain it, and add half a pint 
more cream, whipped, and one ounce of dissolved 
isinglass. Mix the whole well together, and set 
it in a basin imbedded in rough ice; when it 



190 APPENDIX. 

has remained a short time in the ice fill the 
mould with it, and then place the mould in 
ice, or in a cool place, till ready to serve. 



ANOTHER EXCELLENT RECEIPT FOR A FRUIT 
CHARLOTTE. 

Line a jelly mould with fine picked straw- 
berries, which must first be just dipped into 
some liquid jelly, to make them adhere closely, 
then fill the mould with some strawberry cream, 
prepared as follows: take a pottle of scarlet 
strawberries, mix them with half a pound of 
white sugar, rub this through a sieve, and add 
to it a pint of whipped cream, and one ounce 
and a half of dissolved isinglass ; pour it into 
the mould, which must be immersed in ice until 
ready to serve, and then carefully turned out 
on the dish, and garnished according to fancy. 



ICED PUDDING. 

Parboil three quarters of a pound of Jordan 
almonds, and one quarter of bitter almonds, re- 
move the skins and beat them up to a paste, 
with three quarters of a pound of white pounded 



APPENDIX. 191 

sugar^ add to this six yolks of beaten eggs, and 
one quart of boiled cream, stir the whole for a 
few minutes over a stove fire, strain It, and pour 
it into a freezing pot, used for making ices ; it 
should be worked with a scraper, as it becomes 
set by freezing ; when frozen suflSciently firm, fill 
a mould with it, cover it with the lid, and let it 
remain immersed in rough ice until the time for 
serving. 



ITALIAN SALAD. 

Cut up the white parts of a cold fowl, and 
mix it with mustard and cress, and a lettuce 
chopped finely, and pour over a fine salad mix- 
ture, composed of equal quantities of vinegar 
and the finest salad oil, salt, mustard, and the 
yolks of hard boiled eggs, and the yolk of one 
raw egg, mixed smoothly together ; a little tar- 
ragon vinegar is then added, and the mixture 
is poured over the salad; the whites of the e^s 
are mixed, and serve to garnish the dish, ar- 
ranged in small heaps alternately with heaps of 
grated smoked beef; two or three hard boiled 
eggs are cut up with the chicken in small pieces 
and mixed with the salad ; this is a delicate and 



192 APPENDIX, 

refreshing ^fr^; the appearance of this salad 
may be varied by piling the fowl in the centre 
of the dish, then pour over the salad mixture, 
and make a wall of any dressed salad, laying the 
whites of the eggs (after the yolks have been 
removed for the mixture), cut in rings on the 
top like a chain.

THE TOILETTE. 



CHAPTER L 



The various cosmetics sold by perfumers, assum- 
ing such miraculous powers of beautifying the 
complexion, all contain, in different propor- 
tions, preparations of mercury, alcohol, acids, 
and other deleterious substances, which are 
highly injurious to the skin; and their continual 
application will be found to tarnish it, and pro- 
duce furrows and wrinkles far more unsightly 
than those of age, beside which they are fre- 
quently absorbed by the vessels of the skin, 
enter the system, and seriousy disturb the 
general health. 



194 THE TOILETTE. 

A fine fresh complexion is best ensured by 
the habitual use of soft water, a careful avoid- 
ance of all irritants, such as harsh winds, dust, 
smoke, a scorching sun, and fire heat ; a strict 
attention to diet, regular ablutions, followed by 
friction, frequent bathing, and daily exercise, 
active enough to promote perspiration, which, 
by carrying off the vicious secretions, purifies 
the system, and perceptibly heightens the bril- 
liancy of the skin. 

These are the simple and rational means pur- 
sued by the females of the east to obtain a 
smooth and perfect skin, which is there made an 
object of great care and consideration. And it is 
a plan attended, invariably, with the most 
complete success. 

Cosmetic baths, composed of milk, combined 
with various emollient substances are also in 
firequent use among the higher classes in the 
East ; and we have been informed that they are 
gradually gaining favour in France and England. 
We shall give the receipt for one, as we received 
it from the confidential attendant of an English 
lady, who is in the habit of using it every week, 
and we can confidently recommend it to the 
notice of our readers. 



THE TOILETTR, 195 

The luxurious ladies of ancient Rome, who 
sacrificed so much time and attention to the 
adornment of their persons, always superin- 
tended the preparation of their cosmetics, which 
were of the most innocent and simple descrip- 
tion â the first receipt we subjoin was one in 
general use with them, and will be found effica- 
cious in removing roughness, or coarseness, 
arising fi:om accidental causes, and imparting 
that polished smoothness so essential to beauty. 



AN OLD ROMAN RECEIPT FOR IMPROVING THE SKIN. 

Boil a desert spoonfiil of the best wheaten 
flour with half a pint of fresh asses milk ; 
when boiling, stir in a table-spoonful of the 
best honey, and a tea-spoonfiil of rose water, 
then mix smoothly, place in small pots, and 
use a little of it after washing ; it is better not 
to make much at a time, as when stale it is 
liable to irritate the skin. 



A VALUABLE RECEIPT FOR THE SKIN. 

Boil in half a pint of new milk a thick slice 
of stale bread, and a tea-spoonful of gum arabic ; 



\y6 THE, TOILÂ£TTK. 

when bcHled, set h at a Utile disUDoe from the 
fire to amnitf almost to a jeDy, then pass it 
through a fidded maslni, and sdr in a spocmfbl 
of oil of almoDdsy and the same quanti^ 
of hcMieTy with a pinch of oomnKm salt; 
when cold it will be a stiff jeDy. A litde of 
this mixtme warmed and s|Â»ead iqpcm the skin, 
about the thickness of a crown jnece, and left 
on till it cook, will lemove, like magic, all ap- 
pearance of the diT scarf to whidi scHne of the 
finest skins are subject. 



AN EMOLLDENT PASTS. 

Blanch half a pound of sweet ahnonds, and 
two ounces of bitter almonds, and pound them 
in a mortar, then make them into a paste 
with rose water ; this paste is a fine emollient. 



A SUPERIOR OIXTMENT FOR CHAPS, ROUGHNESS, ETC. 

Mix with a gill of finesh cream a spoonful of 
beaten almonds ; when perfectly smooth put it 
in toilette pots, and use as ointment for chaps, 
&c. ; it will keep for a week if a little spirit of 
camphor is added to it. 



THE TOILETTE. 197 

WASH FOR PIMPLES. 

Dissolve half a dram of salt of tartar in three 
ounces of spirit of wine, and apply with soft 
linen; this is an excellent wash for pimples, 
but, as these are in general the result of some 
derangement of the system, it will be wiser to 
discover and remedy the cause, than merely at- 
tending to the result 



LOTION FOE EEMOVING FEECKLES. 

Mix one dram of spirit of salts, half a pint of 
rain water, and half a tea-spoonfed of spirit of 
lavender, and bottle for use. This lotion will 
often be efficacious in removing freckles. 



COLD GEEAM. 

Warm gently together four ounces of oil 
of almonds, and one ounce of white wax, 
gradually adding four oimces of rose water; 
this is one of the best receipts for making cold 
cream. 



198 THÂ£ TOILETTE. 

A FI>Â£ SOAP. 

Blanch and beat to a paste two ounces of bit- 
ter almonds, with a small piece of camphor, and 
one ounce and a half of tincture of Benjamin ; 
add one pound of curd soap in shavings, and 
beat and melt well together, and pour into 
moulds to get cool; the above is a very fine soap. 



LIP SALVE. 

Mix together one ounce of white wax, the 
same of beef marrow, with a small piece of 
alkanet root tied up in muslin ; perfume it ac- 
cording to fimcy, strain, and pot while hot ; the 
above is a fine salve for chapped lips. 



cHEsxxrr paste for rendering the hands 

WHITE AND SOFT. 

Boil a dozen fine large chesnuts, peeled and 
skinned, in milk ; when soft beat them till per- 
fectly smooth with rose water ; a tea-spoonftd of 
this mixture thrown into the water before wash- 
ing the hands renders them beautifully white 
and soft 



THE TOILETTE. 199 

SUPBEIOR MILK OF ROSES. 

Boil fresb rose leaves in asses milk, and bottle 
it off for immediate use ; it will be found far 
more efficacious than the milk of roses sold by 
perfumers. 

AN EXCELLENT RECE^IPT FOR LIP SALVE. 

Melt one ounce of spermacetti, soften suffi- 
ciently with oil of almonds, color it with two or 
three grains of powdered cochineal, and pour 
while warm into small toilet pots. We men- 
tion the cochineal to colour the salve, it being 
usual to make lip salve of a pale rose colour, but 
we should consider it far more healing in its 
effects without it 



A COSMETIC BATH. 

Boil slowly one pound of starwort in two 
quarts of water, with half a pound of linseed, 
six ounces of the roots of the water lily, and one 
pound of bean meal ; when these have boiled 
for two hours, strain the liquor, and add to it 
two quarts of milk, one pint of rose water, and 
a wine glass of spirits of camphor; stir this 



200 THE TQJ[LETTB. 

mixture into a bath of about ninety-eight 
degrees. 



SUPERIOE COLD CREAM. 

Melt together one drachm of spermacetti, the 
same quantity of white wax, and two fluid 
ounces of oil of almond; while these are still 
warm, beat up with them as much rose water as 
they will absorb. This is a very healing kind 
of cold cream. The usual cold cream sold by 
perfumers is nothing more than lard, beat up 
with rose-water, which is heating and irritating 
to the skin. 



PASTE FOR RENDERING THE SKIN SUPPLE AND SMOOTH 
(an ENGLISH receipt). 

Mix half a pound of mutton or goose fat well 
boiled down and beaten up well with two eggs, 
previously whisked with a glass of rose-\yater ; 
add a table-spoonful of honey, and as much 
oatmeal as will make it into a paste. Constant 
use of this paste will keep the skin delicately 
soft and smooth. 



THE TOILETTE. 201 

TO REMOVE TAN. 

Cut a cucumber into pieces after having 
peeled it, and let the juice drain from it for 
twelve hours, pour it oflF, and add to it an equal 
quantity of orange flower-water, with a small 
piece of camphor dissolved in a wine-glass of 
soft water, bottle the mixture, and wash the 
parts that have been exposed to the sun two or 
three times in the twenty-four hours. 



EAU DE COLOGNE. 

Mix together one ounce of essence of ber- 
gamot, the same quantity of essence of lemon, 
lavender, and orange flower-water, two ounces 
of rosemary and honey-water, with one pint of 
spirits of wine ; let the mixture stand a fort- 
night, after which put it into a glass retort, the 
body of which immerse in boiling water con- 
tained in a vessel placed over a lamp (a coflFee 
lamp will answer the purpose), while the beak 
of the retort is introduced into a large decanter ; 
keep the vater boiUng while the mixture dis- 
tils into the decanter, which should be covered 



202 THE TOILETTE. 

with cold wet cloths, in this manner excellent 
Eau de Cologne may be obtained at a very 
small expense. 



TRANSPARENT SOAP. 

Put into a bottle, Windsor soap in shavings, 
half fill it with spirits of wine, set it near the 
fire till the soap is dissolved, when, pour it into 
moulds to cool. 



MILK or ROSES. 

Put into a bottle one pint of rose-water, one 
ounce of oil of almonds ; shake well together, 
then add fifl:y drops of oil of tartar. 



HUNGARY WATER. 

Put into a bottle one pint of spirits of wine, 
one gill of water, and half an ounce of oil of 
rosemary ; shake well together. 



LAVENDER WATER. 

Take three drachms of English oil of lavender, 
spirits of wine one pint ; shake in a quart bottle. 



THE TOILETTE. 203 

then add one ounce of orange flower-water, one 
ounce of rose-water, and four ounces of distilled 
water ; those who approve of the musky odour 
which lavender water sometimes has, may add 
three drachms of essence of ambergris or musk. 



ESSENCE OF ROSES. 

Put into a bottle the petals of the common 
rose, and pour upon them spirits of wine, cork 
the bottle closely, and let it stand for three 
months, it will then be little inferior to otto of 
roses. 



ESSENCE OF LAVENDEE 

Is prepared according to the above recipe, the 
lavender being substituted for the roses. 



SCENT BAGS. 

Small bags filled with iris root diflFuses a deli- 
cate perfume over drawers, &c. A good receipt 
for a scent-bag is as follows: two pounds of 
roses, half a pound of Cyprus powder, and half 
a drachm of essence of roses ; the roses must 
be pounded, and with the powder put into 
silk bags, the essence may be dropped on the 
outside. 



204 THE TOILETTE. 

ESSENCE OF MUSK. 

Mix one dram of musk with the same quan- 
tity of pounded loaf sugar ; add six ounces of 
spirits of wine ; shake together and pour off for 
use. 



OIL OF ROSES. 

A few drops of otto of roses dissolved in 
spirits of wine forms the esprit de rose of the 
perfumers â the same quantity dropped in sweet 
oil forms their huile antique a la rose. 



205 



CHAPTER II. 



All stimulating lotions are injurious to the 
hair; it should be cut every two months: to 
clean it, there is nothing better than an egg 
beaten up to a froth, to be rubbed in the hair, 
and afterwards washed off with elder flower- 
water ; but clear soft water answers every pur- 
pose of cleanliness, and is far better for the hair 
than is usually imagined. 

One tea-spoonful of honey, one of spirits of 
wine, one of rosemary, mixed in half a pint of 
rose-water, or elder flower-water, and the same 
quantity of soft water, forms an excellent lotion 
for keeping the hair clean and glossy. 

A fine pomatum is made by melting down 
equal quantities of mutton suet and marrow. 



206 THE HAIR. 

uncooked, and adding a little sweet oil to make 
it of a proper consistency, to which any perfume 
may be added. If essence of rosemary is the 
perfume used, it will be found to promote the 
growth of the hair. Bum and oil of almonds 
will be of use for the same purpose. A warm 
cloth to rub the hair after brushing imparts a 
fine shiny smoothness. 

As a bandoline to make the hair set close, 
the following will be found useful and cheap : 
take a cupfiil of linseed, pour over it suflS- 
cient boiling water to^ver, let it stand some 
hours, and then pour over three table spoons- 
ful of rose-water; stir the seeds well about, 
and strain it off into a bottle and it will be 
ready for use ; or take a tea-spoonful of gum 
arabic with a little Irish moss, boil them in 
half a pint of water till half is boiled away ; 
strain and perfume. 

To remove superfluous hairs, the following 
receipt will be found effectual, although requir- 
ing time and perseverance: mix one ounce of 
finely powdered pumice-stone with one ounce 
of powdered quick-lime, and rub the mixture on 
the part firom which the hair is to be removed, 
twice in twenty four hours; this will destroy 



THE HAIR, 207 

the hair, and is an innocent appUcation. In 
the East, a depilatory is in use, which we sub- 
join, but which requires great care in employing, 
as the ingredients are likely to injure the skin 
if applied too frequently, or suffered to remain 
on too long : mix with one ounce of quick-lime, 
one ounce of orpiment; put the powder in a 
bottle with a glass stopper ; when required for 
use, mix it into a paste with barley-water; 
apply this over the part, and let it remain some 
minutes, then gently take it off with a silver 
knife, and the hairs will be found perfectly 
removed; the part should then be fomented to 
prevent any of the powder being absorbed by 
the skin, and a little sweet oil or cold cream 
should be wiped over the surface with a feather. 



208 



CHAPTER III. 



Water is not always sufficient to clean the 
teeth, but great caution should be used as to 
the dentifrices employed. 

Charcoal; reduced to an impalpable powder, 
and mixed with an equal quantity of magnesia, 
renders the teeth white, and stops putre- 
faction. 

Also two ounces of prepared chalk, mixed 
with half the quantity of powdered myrrh, may 
be used with confidence. 

Or, one ounce of finely powdered charcoal, 
one ounce of red kino, and a table spoonful of 
the leaves of sage, dried and powdered. 

A most excellent dentifiice, which cleans and 
preserves the teeth, is made by mining together 



TEBTH 209 

two ounces of brown rappee snuff, one of 
powder of bark, and one ounce and a half of 
powder of myrrh. When the gums are inclined 
to shrink from the teeth, cold water should be 
used frequently to rinse the mouth; a little 
alum, dissolved in a pint of water, a tea-cup fiill 
of sherry wine, and a little tincture of myrrh or 
bark, will be found extremely beneficial in re- 
storing the gums to a firm and healthy state. 
This receipt was given verbally by one of our 
first dentists. 

Every precaution should be used to prevent 
the accumulation of tartar upon the teeth ; this 
is best done by a regular attention to clean- 
liness, especially during and after illness. " Pre- 
vention is always better than cure," and the 
operation of scaling often leaves the teeth weak 
and liable to decay. 

Acids of all sorts are injurious to the teeth, 
and very hot or cold liquids discolour them. 

The best toothpick is a finely-pointed stick of 
cedar. Toothbrushes should not be too hard, and 
should be used, not only to the teeth, but to the 
gums, as fiiction is highly salutary to them. To 
polish the front teeth, it is better to use a piece 
of flannel than a brush. 



210 TEETH. 

Toothache is a very painful malady^ and the 
sufferer often flies to the most powerful spirits to 
obtain relief; but they afford only temporary 
ease, and lay the foundation for increased pain. 
A poultice laid on the gum not too hot takes off 
inflammation, or laudanum and spirits of cam- 
phor applied to the cheek externally ; or mix 
with spirits of camphor an equal quantity of 
myrrh, dilute it with warm water, and hold it 
in the mouth; also a few drops of laudanum 
and oil of cloves applied to decayed teeth often 
affords instantaneous relief. 

Powdered cloves and powdered alum, rubbed 
on the gum and put in the diseased tooth will 
sometimes lessen the pain. 

Toothache often proceeds from some irritation 
in the digestive organs or the nervous system â¢ 
in such cases pain can only be removed by 
proper medical treatment. 



211 



CHAPTER IV. 



Nothing contributes more to the elegance and 
refinement of a lady's appearance than delicate 
hands; and it is surprising how much it is in 
the power of all, by proper care and attention, 
to improve them. Gloves should be worn at 
every opportunity, and these should invariably 
be of kid; silk gloves and mittens, although 
pretty and tasteful, are far from fulfilling the 
same object. The hands should be regularly 
washed in tepid water, as cold water hardens, 
and renders them Uable to chap, while hot water 
wrinkles them. All stains of ink, &c., should 
be immediately removed with lemon-juice and 
salt: every lady should have a bottle of this 
mixture on her toilette ready prepared for the 



212 HANDS. 

purpose. The receipts which we have akeady 
given as emollients for the skin are suitable 
for softening the hands and rendering them 
smooth and delicate. The nails require daily 
attention : they should be cut every two or three 
days in an oval form. A piece of flannel is 
better than a nail-brush to clean them with^ as 
it does not separate the nail from the finger. 

When dried, a little pummice-stone, finely 
powdered, with powdered orris-root, in the pro- 
portion of a quarter of a tea-spoonfiil to a tea- 
spoonful of the former, mixed tc^ther, and 
rubbed on the nails gently, gives them a fine 
polish, and removes all inequalities. 

A piece of sponge, dipped in oil of roses and 
emery, may be used for the same purpose. 

When the nails are disposed to break, a little 
oil or cold cream should be applied at night. 

Sand-balls are excellent for removing hard- 
ness of the hands. Palm soap, Castille soap, 
and those which are the least perfumed, should 
always be preferred. IS^ght-gloves are con- 
sidered to make the hands white and soft, but 
they are attended with inconvenience, besides 
being very unwholesome ; and the hands may 
be rendered as white as the nature of the com- 



HANDS. 213 

plexion will allow, by constantly wearing gloves 
in the day-time, and using any of the emollients 
we have recommended for softening and im- 
proving the skin. 



214 



CHAPTER V. 



In dress, simplicity should be preferred to 
magnificence: it is surely more gratifying to 
be admired for a refined taste, than for an 
elaborate and dazzling splendour; â the former 
always produces pleasing impressions, while the 
latter generaUy only provokes criticism. 

Too costly an attire forms a sort of fortifi- 
cation around a woman which wards off the 
admiration she might otherwise attract The 
true art of dress is to make it harmonize so per- 
fectly with the style of countenance and figure 
as to identify it, as it were, with the character 
of the wearer. 

All ornaments and trimmings should be 
adopted sparingly ; trinkets and jewellery should 



DRE8S. 215 

seldom appear to be worn merely for display ; 
they should be so selected and arranged as to 
seem necessary, either for the proper adjust- 
ment of some part of the dress, or worn for the 
sake of pleasing associations. 

Fashion should never be followed too closely, 
still less should a singularity of style be affected ; 
the prevailing mode should be modified and 
adapted to suit individual peculiarity. The 
different effect of colours and the various forms 
of dress should be duly considered by every 
lady, as a refined taste in dress indicates a 
correct judgment. 

A short stout figure should avoid the loose 
flowing robes and ample drapery suitable for 
tall slight women; while these again should be 
cautious of adopting fashions which compress 
the figure, give formality, or display angles. 
The close-fitting corsage and tight sleeve, be- 
coming to the short, plump female, should be 
modified with simple trimmings, to give fiillness 
and width across the shoulders and bust, and a 
rounded contour to the arms. Flounces and 
tucks, which rise high in the skirt, are not 
suitable to short persons; they cut the figure 
and destroy symetry. To tall women, on the 



216 DBE88. 

contrary, tbey add grace and dignity. Dresses 
made half high are extremely unbecoming; 
they should either be cut close up to the throat 
ot low. It is, however, in bad taste to wear 
them very low on the shoulders and bosom : in 
youth, it gives evidence of the absence of that 
modesty which is one of its greatest attractions ; 
and in maturer years it is the indication of a 
depraved coquetry, which checks the admiration 
it invites. 

It is always requisite for a lady to exert her 
own taste in the choice of form, colour, and 
style, and not leave it to the fancy of her dress- 
maker, as although the person she employs may 
be eminently quahfied for her profession, a lady 
who possesses any discernment can best judge 
of what is suitable to her style of countenance 
and figure. 

In dress there should be but one prevailing 
colour, to which all others should be adapted^ 
either by harmonisitig with it, or by contrast ; in 
the latter case the relieving color should be in 
smaU quantity, or it would overpower the other 
in effect, as a general rule, sombife negative 
colours show off a woman to the greatest advan- 
tage, just as the beauties of a painting are 



DRESS. 217 

enhanced by being set in a dull frame ; still, there 
are some occasions vdth which the pjayer tints 
accord better, and as propriety and fitness are 
matters of high consideration, the woman of 
taste must be guided in the selection of her 
apparel by the knowledge of the purport for 
which it is intended, always endeavouring to fix 
on that shade of colour which best becomes her 
complexion.

EFFECTS OF DIET. 219 

be avoided, for they stimulate and exhaust the 
vital organs, and interrupt the digestive iunc^ 
tions, thereby producing irritation of the internal 
linings of the stomach, with which the skin 
sympathises. Water, on the other hand, is the 
most wholesome of all beverages, it dilutes and 
corrects what is taken into the stomach, and con- 
tributes to the formation of a perfect chyle. 

Milk is very nutritious, it produces a foil 
habit of body, and promotes plumpness, restores 
vigour and freshness, besides possessing the 
property of calming the passions, and equalising 
the temper. 

Eggs are, in general, considered bilious, ex- 
cept in a raw state, when they are precisely the 
reverse ; this is a fact, now so universally ac- 
knowledged, that they are always recommended 
in cases of jaundice and other disorders of the 
bile. 

Spices, and highly seasoned meats import a 
dryness to the skin, and render the body thin 
and meagre. 

Animal food taken daily requires constant 
exercise, or it is apt to render the appearance 
coarse and gross. It should be combined with 
farinaceous and vegetable food, in order to 



220 BFFECT8 OF DIET. 

correct the heating effects of a concentrated ani- 
mal diet 

Excess as to quantity should be strictly 
guarded against When the stomach is over- 
loaded it distributes a badly digested mass 
throughout the system, which is sure to be fol- 
lowed by irritati(m and disease, and by under- 
mining the constitution, is one of the most certain 
methods of destroying beauty. 



221 



CHAPTER YIL 
ptavAt). 



All passions give their corresponding expres- 
sion to the countenance ; if of frequent occur- 
rence they mark it vdth lines as indelible as 
those of age, and &r more imbecoming. To 
keep these under proper control is, therefore, 
of high importance to beauty. Nature has or- 
dained that passions shall be but passing acts of 
the mind, which, serving as natural stimulants, 
quicken the circulation of the blood, and increase 
the vital energies ; consequently, when tempered 
and subdued by reason, they are rather conducive 
than otherwise, both to beauty and to health. 

It is the habittial frame of mind, the hourly 
range of thought which render the countenance 
pleasing or repulsive ; we should not forget that 
" the face is the index of the mind." 



222 INFLUENCE OF THE MIND, ETC. 

The exercise of the intellect and the develop- 
ment of noble sentiments is as essential for the 
perfection of the one, as of the other, fretful, 
envious, malicious, ill humoured feelings must 
never be indulged by those who value their 
personal appearance, for the existence of these 
chronic maladies of the mind, cannot he con- 
cealed. 

** On peut tromper un autre^ mais pas tous les autres." 

In the same way candour, benevolence, pity, 
and good temper, exert the most happy influence 
over the whole person ; â shine forth in every look 
and every movement with a fascination which 
wins its way to all hearts. 

Symmetry of form is a rare and exquisite gift, 
but there are other conditions quite as indis- 
pensable to beauty. Let a woman possess but a 
very moderate share of personal charms, if her 
countenance is expressive of intellect and kind 
feelings, her figure buoyant with health, and her 
attire distinguished by a tasteful simplicity, she 
cannot fail to be eminently attractive, while ill 
health â a silly or unamiable expression, and a 
vulgar taste â will mar the eflect of form and 
features the most symetrical. A clever writer 
has said, " Beauty is but another name for that 



INFLUENCE OF THE MIND, ETC. 223 

expression of the countenance which is indica- 
tive of sound health, intelligence, and good 
feeling." K so, how much of beauty is attain- 
able to all! Health, though often dependant 
upon circumstances beyond our control, can, 
in a great measure, be improved by a rational 
observance of the laws which nature has pre- 
scribed, to regulate the vital functions. 

Over intellect we have still more power. It 
is capable of being so trained as to approach 
daily nearer and nearer to perfection. The 
thoughts are completely under our own guidance 
and must never be allowed to wander idly or 
sinfully ; they should be encouraged to dwell on 
subjects which elevate the mind and shield it 
from the petty trivialities which irritate and de- 
grade it. 

Nothing is more likely to engender bitter 
thoughts than idleness and ennui. Occupations 
should be selected with a view to improve and 
amuse ; they should be varied, to prevent the 
lassitude resulting from monotony ; serious medi- 
tations and abstract studies should be relieved 
by the lighter branches of literature; music 
should be assiduously cultivated ; nothing more 
refines and exalts the mind; not the mere 



224 INFLUBNCE OF THS MIND^ BTC. 

performance of mechanical difficulties^ either 
vocal or instrumental, for these, unless pursued 
with extreme caution, enlarge the;^hand and 
&tigue the chest, without imparting the advan- 
tages we allude to. 

Drawing is highly calculated to enhance femi- 
nine beauty ; the thoughts it excites are soothing 
and serene, the gentle enthusiasm that is felt 
during this delightful occupation not only dissi- 
pates melancholy and morbid sensibiUty, but by 
developing the judgment and feeling, imparts a 
higher tone of character to the expression of 
the countenance. 

Indolent persons are apt to decide that they 
have " no taste " for such or such pursuits, for- 
getting that tastes may be acquired hy the mind 
as well as by the palate, and only need a judi- 
cious direction. 

Frivolous employment, and vitiated sentiments 
would spoil the finest face ever created. Body 
and mind are, in fact, so intimately connected, 
that it is futile, attempting to embellish the one, 
while neglecting the other, especially as the 
highest order of all beauty is the intellectual. 
Let those females, therefore, who are the most 



INFLUENCE OF THE MIND. 235 

solicitous about their beauty, and the most eager 
to produce a favourable impression, cultivate the 
moral, reliffious, and intellectual attributes, and in 
this advice consists the recipe for the finest cos- 
metic in the world, viz. â content.
