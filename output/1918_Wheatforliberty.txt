UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 



Wheat For Liberty 




The only question for every true-hearted American to-day is: 
"What can I do to help win the war?" The only answer — "Give 
instantly the service needed." 

" That service now is until the next harvest for you to share your 
wheat with your comrades across the sea — for you who can afford it 
to give your whole share to them." 



WHEAT IS NOW A LUXURY FOR INVALIDS, BABIES AND 
THE VERY POOR. 

IT IS NOT NOW FIT FOOD FOR STRONG MEN AND WOMEN. 

Autocracy compels, and gives no reasons. 
Democracy requests, and gives reasons. 
Are you ready for Democracy? 

The allied countries of Europe lack wheat because: BeJf/ivrn, formerly 
strong, splendid and free, has America only to look to for daily 
bread; England formerly imported her wheat from South America 
and Australia as well as from North America; France and Itahj 
have lost to the army the majority of their farmers; their women 
are needed in munition factories and in other civil occupations. 
Fertilizers and farming tools are lacking. 

The allied countries of Europe need wheat because: Bread has been 
one of the chief sources of nourishment. Bakeries can not make 
raised bread without wheat flour — French homes in particular de- 
pend on bakeries; fuel and time are lacking. One bakery can sup- 
ply hundreds of families and so release hundreds of pounds of coal, 
hundreds of hours of time. If we insist upon eating wheat needed 
abroad. Liberty's armies and Liberty's civil population will collapse 
as Russia collapsed, because the food supplies of her armies and 
her civil population failed.

Citizens of America, it is bad enough to have those countries across 
the seas bear the brunt of alJ the flohting. It is impossible to believo 
that with the facts before us, there is a living man or woman Avho 
will permit those countries to starve for us also. In old times the 
Prophets would have cursed the bread so eaten. It needs no Prophet 
now to say that there is a curse for anyone who in mere gratification 
of appetite cats wheaten bread, and that curse proclaims him a 
traitor to himself and to his country. 

Enough has been said and written. The one who does not now 
understand the situation is an ignoramus or a slacker; the igno- 
ramus can't and the slacker won't understand. The real pure-ln-cd 
American from now on needs only the briefest message from one 
whom he trusts. 

BROTHER, YOUR COMRADES NEED WHEAT. 

The Food Administrator for America has said, " My message 
is small and concrete, the service that we ask of you, that we a^^k of 
every well-to-do, every inde]iendent person in the United States 
to-day is that he shall abstain from the use of wheat in any form 
until the next harvest."
