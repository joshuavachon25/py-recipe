PREFACE. 



THIS book has Ijeen specially adapted to Amer^ 
ican methods, anybody using it outside of 
the United States, please remember, that 
each nation has its pecularities. The book has been 
written for the purpose of giving a clear and net 
explanation of terms used in first-class catering 
establishments in regard to dishes and drinks served. 
These terms have come into practical use in the 
course of years and set a standard for all high-clasa 
places. Though often misused by minor houses, 
they are always respected in high-class hotels and 
restaurants. 

The volume has been specially compiled for 
waiters, who can not be expected to know th* 
thousands of different dishes and names by heart. 
A quick glance in the book will give them all de- 
sired information and a little study will instruct 
them a great deal. 

Many "so-called" waiters have the custom, I am 
sorry to say, to tell the guest a dish is prepared in 
such and such a way, when a very different thing 
is meant. They then help themselves out of tho 
hole by serving what they explained. 

By this manner a very vexing mix-up of ideas 
and names follows and guests are often put in con- 
fusion when they order a certain dish by name la 
an other hotel and explain to their friends how it 
is made up. 

It is certainly to be desired that the public In 
question should be a little more broadly instructed 
on these questions, specially as a tendency is pre- 
vailing all over the world and exceptionally so in 
this COUNTRY, to regulate all business after a 
given standard. 

The more the public gets to know this standard^ 
the harder the fakers will have to fight for their 
existence. 

THE AUTHOR. 



NOTE. 



THIS dictionary has been compiled by tlie author 
from the latest and most reliable sources, 
and no effort has been spared to gather 
into it all formulae concerning COOKERY, CEL- 
LARING AND DRINKS, and special care has been 
paid to the correctness of set-up. Considering how- 
ever that many cooks like to explore their ovm 
: fancy, waiters are cautioned to always observe a 
certain reserve in giving explanations, seeing that 
some guests fellow the sport of getting the waiter 
into trouble. The best way out of this difficulty 
is to tell the guest that "as much as I can remem- 
ber" the dish is prepared in such and such a way. 

The plan and method of this little volume are 
new and a cursory glance will at once reveal its 
unique and useful character. Notwithstanding the 
small space alloted the compiler presents a list of 
about 6000 different receipts. This small lexicon 
is designed for the use of waiters and HOTEL 
PEOPLE generally, as well as for GUESTS, who 
like to do their own ordering, or find out all about 
some dishes they have seen in hotels in the shortest 
possible manner. Guests may also find out from 
the Menu what this or that dish consists of, and 
anybody fairly well acquainted with the little re- 
ference-book v/ili have no trouble in locating any 
and all fancy names. 

-The names are derived from specialties of coun- 
/Iries, towns or prominent people, either in state, or 
kitchen affairs. 

Special attention is called to the garnishes, sauces 
and soups, as many useful hints may be gained 
therefrom. 

In order that the method and construction of 
this volume may be clearly understood it would 
seem necessary to present the following explana- 
tion: Any dish that is being sought should be looked 
^or first under the letter. For example: Grape, 



flPniit, Supreme — look up Grape fruit, first on letter 
*'G,** if you do not find a thorough explanation, 
look up Supreme in letter "S," if this should fail 
and no clue indicated, try to think out where you 
may probably find the solution; it will very likely 
occur to you that an iced fruit is understood, so 
look up Ices next and you will surely find the de- 
sired explanation in the best form; carry out this 
plan in all cases, though it will hardly be necessary, 
as most times you will find a remark that will lead 
you to the right heading. After a short time of 
study the reader will develop a right instinct on 
culinary matters, that will make the book in most 
cases superfluous, and he will then only have to re- 
fer to it in doubtful cases. 

In the case of Fishes, Relevees, (removes, etc.), it 
is best to look up the Garnishes first, as this will 
in most cases solve the question; if however Gar- 
mishes, Sauces and the Letter should fail, think of a 
.-similar dish and look that one up as stated before. 
For example: Mignon of filets of beef and Tour- 
nedos. 

In some instances dishes will be found with slight 
additions, or the one or other missing, such as spe- 
cialties of certain houses, in that case the author 
would greatly appreciate, if the reader would collect 
the mentioned instances and communicate with him 
on card or letter. These dishes can then be added 
in following editions and in this way the book 
becomes the most complete ever dreamed of.

piles of small plates standing ready with knives,

be near to render such assistance as may be de- 
sired and clear away the soiled plates. The- 
best wines to go with a buffet are dessert wines, 
such as Sherry, etc. These instructions apply 
practically to every pic-nic; a pic-nic is noth- 
ing more then a buffet in the open-air. 
Wine, beer and lictuor — and how they should ac- 
company the different courses. 
With Hers d'Oeuvre — dessert wine. Sherry, Mar- 
ala. etc. 
With fish and oysters — white Moselle, Rhine, 

Bordeau, white Burgundy. 
With Releve or grosse piece — light red Bordeau, 

Burgundy or Italian wine.

may be given. 
With the coffee — a choice of liquors.

wines Avith sweets, or heavy Burgundys with 

fat grosse-pieces.

SOME HINTS ON SERVICE. 



Single guests are best served by putting dishes 
in front of them and allowing them to help them- 
selves. 

Two guests sitting on one table are shown the 
dishes first and then the different things are served 
out on a side-table and handed over. The guest 
being served first and the host last; in case of 
doubt as to who may happen to be the host, serve 
the eldest one first. 

The same rule obtains for parties consisting of 
more then two people, here all ladies are served 
first according to age. 

Vegetables are always dished out on the table. 
Inquiry should be made if the patron wishes a 
separate vegetable dish (plate, small and deep), 
and in case of small vegetables, such as peas, etc., 
being served; a tea-spoon should be given as a 
matter of course. In the case of large parties vege- 
tables are served around, so that each guest can 
help himself. 

After the dishing out has been performed the 
dishes with the remaining viands should possibly 
be set on the guest's table, specially if no heaters 
are provided on the service tables. 

The waiter is expected to help the guest a sec- 
ond time if he so desires it. Steaks are usually 
carved in two thick pieces out of the centre, gar- 
nished with some cresses from the dish and a little 
(never much) herb-butter. 

In America wild ducks are always served with 
jelly, as well as game and roast mutton. 

Large will ducks, when roasted, should be served 
additionally with fried hominy and the carcasse 
squeezed in the forwarmed press; only the wings 
and the breast are served of this fowl and the blood 
from the press is served over them after having 
bf^en heated in a chafing dish or very hot deep 
plate, and sometimes seasoned with celery salt. 
Care should be taken that no fat mingles with this 



333 

juice. In the case of canvas baff-ducks, a season- 
ing of hashed liver (fowl) and brandy or sherry, 
orang:e-,iiiice and paprika is given and prepared 
before the guest's eye. The same applies to Rouen- 
naise ducks. Roast or cold lamb should always be 
served with mint sauce or mint jollv, respectively. 

All shafing dishes should be served with terrapin 
plates and toast if they do not contain birds or 
steaks, (venison steaks), which are sometimes 
served in chafing dishes. 

Deep plates, cream and poudered sugar must be 
served with cereals, (breakfast food). Hot deserts 
ought to be served with hot dessert plates and cold 
desserts with cold dessert plates from the ice box. 

Also should all fresh fruit be ice-cold when 
served. 

All dishes liable to make the fingers sticky, should 
be followed by a finger-bowl. 

C4rape fruits, when served with cherries and 
maraskino, should have the liquor separate and the 
waiter should go around and pour it over the fruit 
in such a way, that the guest can bid him stop, 
when he thinks that his taste for liquors has had 
its share. The liquor-bottle is sometimes given to 
the guest himself, as some people are a little par- 
ticular on that score. Don't forget the sugar and 
tea-spoon. 

All broiled fish should be served with lemon and 
herb-butter. 

Waiters should train their eye and see that salt, 
pepper, bread, butter and ice water are always on 
the table and are replenished in due time, even in 
rush hours. They should serve mustard and sauces 
without being asked for them with all dishes that 
mav possibly require this addition. 

Never remove cork from sauce or catchup bottles 
or shake them; let the guest do this according to 
his taste. 

It goes without saying that waiters should help 
their guests in and out of their wraps and coats, 
also push their chairs, when they come or prepare 
to leave. They should also look underneath the table 
to see if anything has been dropped, lost, or for- 
gotten. They will then be in time to restore it to 
the a:uest before he leaves the place. 

The waiter's fee is usually ten per cent of the 
bill, thoTigh of course he has no means to enforce 



334 __^ 

this unwritten law, but seeing that every man is 
worth his pay, and considering that waiters are 
working much harder than any other average worker 
— it is only fair that his claim should he regarded 
just as well as anybody else's. 

Waiters are paid usually $25.00 per month from 
their employer and anybody familiar with Amer- 
ican coditions, will readily acknowledge that no 
man working long hours can live on this amount; 
particularly as food in hotels for employees is ex- 
ceptionally bad, and as they have to provide their 
own lodgings. 

The guest will never go fail if he pays a quarter 
a head in high-class places if he does not like to 
figure out the percentage; considering that la 
waiter in these places only gets one party a meal, 
it is not to much.
