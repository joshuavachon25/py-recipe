NOTE 

When entering upon the practice of my profession, I was 
greeted with many important questions, relating to the chemis- 
try of food, as well as those pertaining to its special prepara- 
tions. These ever- recurring questions were "dotted down" — 
hence this little Class Book. 

While I fully realize that the questions herein contained, 
are not the only ones that might come up in household chem- 
istry lessons, they do cover the most important and useful 
subjects. Little attempt has been made to classify the ques- 
tions ; one being so nearly related to the other, they form a 
common whole. 

In Class a certain number of questions are given each 
pupil, who is required, not only to write the answers, but to 
give a practical demonstration of each. 

The Training Classes are under special instructions, and 
graded diplomas will be awarded pupils passing the examina- 
tion. 

Terms, $io per quarter of twelve lessons. Materials 
extra. Private lessons $2 per hour. 

Gratuitous lessons will be given to working women, who 
sign the papers for a three months' course. By this offer we 
hope to prove that cooking can be made profitable as a trade. 

The according of graded diplomas will, we believe, in a 
few years effect a change of great importance to housekeepers 
and household help.
