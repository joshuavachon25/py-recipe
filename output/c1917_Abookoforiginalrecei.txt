PREFACE 

Because of the scarcity of some foodstuffs, 
and the high price of all, it has become neces- 
sary for the housewife to so adjust the diet- 
ary habits of herself and family as to utilize 
the bulky, perishable, and local foods, releas- 
ing the concentrated ones for our soldiers 
and allies, and to practice more rigid econ- 
omy than she is fitted to do successfully, 
without specific directions. 

Hence, for the benefit of these loyal wo- 
men who earnestly desire to serve our coun- 
try by conserving our food, and at the same 
time to feed their families well, and in re- 
sponse to numerous requests, this little book 
of original receipts was published. 

It does not pretend to cover the whole 
range of cookery, but only to be a guide to 
patriotic, economical, good cooking. 

May it fill a real need, and may it be re- 
ceived in the spirit in which it was written.

GENERAL NOTES 

"Receipt" is preferable to "Recipe" accord- 
ing to the latest editions of the best diction- 
aries. 

Standard sized measuring cups, table- 
spoons, and teaspoons are used. All meas- 
urements are level. 



BREAD 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BREAD 
MAKING 

While satisfactory bread can be made with 
water, that made with whole milk, skim 
milk, or even half milk and half water will 
be a little more nutritious, more tender, bet- 
ter flavored, and creamier in color. 

When the liquid used is milk, or part milk, 
scald it and cool until lukewarm. When wa- 
ter is used, heat until lukewarm. To this 
warm liquid add the fat, syrup or sugar, and 
salt, then lightly break in the yeast, allowing 
to stand two or three minutes until yeast 
softens. Add the flour and knead until the 
dough is smooth and velvety, and does not 
stick to the fingers. 

When baking several loaves much time can 
be saved by weighing instead of measuring 
the flour. Place the pan or mixer containing 



/!pv <7 V 7<^ /? ■ i-^ 



Page Four 



liquid on scales and sift flour directly into it, 
avoiding the use of extra utensil. 

When using a bread-mixer all the flour 
should be added at once ; when trying a new 
brand however, it is better to scant the meas- 
ui"ement at first and add more later than to 
have the dough too stiff. But accurate ac- 
count should be kept of all flour used so that 
in after bakings it can all be added at one 
time. 

Dough mixed seven minutes in a bread- 
mixer will produce as fine a loaf as that 
kneaded forty-seven minutes by hand, altho 
the dough will not look as smooth when mix- 
ing is first finished. 

Do not grease the kneaded dough, as a 
kneaded surface will not mix well and often 
leaves a crack in the finished loaf, but cover 
the dough with a snugly fitting lid or plate to 
exclude the air. If the dough is covered only 
with a cloth, a heavy crust will be foi-med 
which will produce a dark streak wherever 
it is worked into the loaf. Do not place on a 



heated surface to rise. Remember always 
that a room that is comfortable for you is 
waiTn enough for your bread. 

When dough has doubled in bulk, pinch off 
piece size of loaf desired, lay in ungreased 
bread-pan, pressing well into corners and 
around edges so that center is a little higher 
than sides. 

Cover (this time a cloth may be used, for 
if crust is formed it will not spoil the crust 
of the baked loaf) , and let rise until doubled 
in bulk. Bake one hour, commencing with a 
temperature of about 350", increasing to 
about 400", and decreasing the last fifteen 
minutes of the hour. The bread should not 
begin to brown until it has been in the oven 
ten minutes. When baked remove from pan 
and place on bread cooler or crosswise on the 
pan until thoroughly cooled, then put, with- 
out cloth or paper, into clean bread box. 

Do not grease the crust upon removing 
from the oven. A greased crust will be soft 



Page Five 



and tough, while one that is not greased will 
be deliciously crisp. 

Syrup has been used in most receipts in- 
stead of sugar, but when sugar is plentiful it 
may be substituted for the syrup if desired. 

The fat preferred is a vegetable oil or fat, 
altho any kind may be used. 

Hard wheat flour should always be used 
for yeast doughs, soft wheat for baking pow- 
der and soda mixtures, and for pastries. 

"About" is used in flour measurements be- 
cause flours vary so greatly that definite 
quantities cannot be specified. Enough 
should be used to make the dough just stiff 
enough to be handled without sticking to the 
fingers. If dough is of this consistency and 
well baked, it will not stick if baked in an 
ungreased pan. 



YEASTS 

Just as surely as the grade of corn har- 
vested depends upon the quality of the seed 
which was planted, so surely does the fin- 
ished loaf of bread depend upon the yeast 
used. Plant inferior seed and you reap in- 
ferior returns, whether it be corn or bread. 
Use an over-fermented yeast and it will pro- 
duce a sour-flavored bread. 

While many women assert they CAN make 
a sweet loaf with liquid yeast — or one kept 
from one baking until the next — the fact re- 
mains that they seldom do so. 

More satisfactory than liquid yeast is the 
commercial dry yeast. Bread made with it 
is perfectly sweet if properly handled. But 
the yeast plants in dry yeast are like seeds, 
requiring a long period of germination before 
showing any signs of growth; hence a long 
time is necessary for baking with it. 

In compressed yeast the plants are in the 
condition of bulbs, commencing to grow im- 



Page Six 



mediately upon entering a growing medium. 
The time required for baking with it varies 
from six to twelve hours according to the 
quantity of yeast used. 

If you enjoy bread with an acid flavor, 
ranging from a mere suggestion of acidity 
to one that rivals that of salad itself, then 
use liquid yeast. 

If you want a loaf that is sweet and like- 
wise want something to occupy your mind 
and keep you about the house twenty-four 
hours use dry yeast. But if you want the best 
loaf that can be baked, and want to produce 
it with the least possible expenditure of 
those precious things called Energy and 
Time, use compressed yeast. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 

MAKING BREAD WITH 

DRY YEAST 

For every cup of liquid called for in receipt 
use a quarter cake of yeast. Soak the re- 
quired quantity of yeast in a half cup warm 
water three hours. In the evening make a 
sponge with the liquid called for (deducting 
the half cup used for soaking the yeast) , the 
sugar, and half the flour, using the white 
flour; add the soaked yeast, beat vigorously 
and set to rise in a place free from drafts. 
In the morning add remaining ingredients, 
knead stiff, and finish according to "General 
Directions for Bread Making." 



NOTES 

When using compressed yeast, double or 
treble the quantity specified may be used 
if it is necessary to bake the bread quickly. 



Page Seven 



Water may be used instead of milk in all 
bread receipts. 

One cup of flour weighs four ounces. 

When directions are not jjiven with receipt 
follow "General Directions for Bread Mak- 
ing" if using compressed yeast, and "General 
Directions for Making Bread with Dry 
Yeast" if using dry yeast. 

All receipts calling for 1 cup liquid make 
one loaf of bread. 

WATER BREAD 
(Four Loaves) 

4 cups water 2 tablespoons fat 

2 tablespoons syrup 4 teaspoons salt 

1 cake yeast About 12 cups (3 lbs. flour) 

The fat may be omitted if desired, and the 
bread, while not quite so tender, will still be 
palatable and satisfactory. 

MILK BREAD 
(One Loaf) 



1 cup sweet milk 

2 teaspoons syrup 
14 cake yeast 



1 teaspoon fat 
1 teaspoon salt 
About 3 cups flour 



MILK BREAD

4 cups sweet milk 
2 tablespoons syrup 
1 cake yeast 



4 teaspoons fat 
4 teaspoons salt 
About 12 cups flour 



WHOLE WHEAT OR GRAHAM BREAD 

1 cup sweet milk 1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons sorghum 214 cups unsifted Graham 
% cake yeast or whole wheat flour 

1 teaspoon fat M cup chopped prunes 

Scald milk, remove from stove and cool. 
Add the sorghum, fat and salt, then lightly 
break in the yeast, allowing to stand until 
yeast rises to top of liquid. Put in the flour, 
and before mixing drop the prunes into it. 
Beat vigorously, cover, and let rise until dou- 
bled in bulk. 

Beat again and turn into well greased loaf 
or gem pans. Let rise until not quite dou- 
bled in bulk and bake. If gem pans are used, 
thirty-five minutes baking will be sufficient; 
if loaf pan, bake one hour. Altho coarse in 



Page Eight 



texture, this bread is palatable and whole- 
some. 

WHOLE WHEAT, OR GRAHAM, AND 
WHITE FLOUR BREAD 

1 cup sweet milk 2 teaspoons tat 

1 tablespoon syrup 1 teaspoon salt 

Vi cake yeast 1 cup white flour 

2 cups Graham or whole wheat flour 

The addition of white flour makes a lighter 
loaf than one made entirely of the whole 
wheat or Graham. If a still lighter loaf is 
desired, sifted whole wheat or Graham may 
be used (the bran sifted out should be saved 
for other use) and the bread will closely re- 
semble that sold on the market under that 
name. 

RAISED BRAN BREAD 



1 cup sweet milk or 

1 cup prune juice 

2 tablespoons sorghum 
Vz cake yeast 

1 teaspoon salt 



% cup white flour

CRUMB BREAD 



1 cup sweet milk 
1 tablespoon syrup 
1 cup stale bread 

crumbs 
Vi cake yeast 



1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon fat 

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 

About 214 cups white flour 



If white bread is used for the crumbs, half 
the flour may be rye, barley, whole wheat or

lent for toast. 



CARROT BREAD 

1 cup sweet milk 1% teaspoons salt 

1 cup hot mashed car- % tablespoon fat 

rots About 3 cups white flour 

Vi cake yeast 

No sweetening is needed because of the 
sugar in the carrots. This makes a beautiful 
yellow bread, and is an easy way to feed car- 
rots to those fastidious people who think 
they do not like them. A cup of mashed car- 
rots may be added to any of the dark breads. 



WHEAT AND BANANA FLOUR BREAD 



1 cup sweet milk 
1 teaspoon syrup 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 cake yeast 



1 teaspoon fat 

1 cup banana flour 

About 2 cups flour 



This flour, which is a combination of ban- 
anas and wheat, requires more yeast than 
white flour. It should bake a little more 
slowly than white flour doughs. 

BREAD STICKS 



1 cup sweet milk 
% cake yeast 
Vi cup syrup 



1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons fat 
About 314 cups flour

off a piece of dough about the size of an un- 
hulled walnut and roll between the hands un- 
til it is the length of the bread stick pan and 
as thick as a clothespin. If preferred, two 
short sticks, instead of one long one, may be 
baked in each compartment. Let rise until 
doubled and bake thirty minutes in a hot 



Page EleTen 



oven. Any yeast or quick bread to be eaten 
hot is much more wholesome baked in bread 
stick pans than in mutiin or gem pans. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS 

Follow receipt for Bread Sticks using 2 ta- 
blespoons syrup instead of quantity specified. 
When ready to mold, roll until one-third inch 
thick, cut with round cutter, crease thru cen-

2 tablespoons syrup 

About 2% cups flour 

Follow "General Directions." Mold into 
small, round buns. 

It it not necessary to use fat in potato 
breads unless a very tender bread is desired.

1 cup sweet milk 4 egg yolks 

% cup hot mashed po- 1 tablespoon fat 

tatoes 1% teaspoons salt 

1 cake yeast Vs cup potato flour 

^4 cup syrup 

About 2 cups white flour 



Page Twelve 



Mix mashed potatoes with the hot milk 
and proceed according to general directions. 
Mold as Parker House rolls. 

SUGAR ROLLS 

Follow receipt for Potato Buns, using 
enough flour to make dough stiff enough to 
be easily handled. When ready to mold, pinch 
off two pieces the size of walnuts, roll be- 
tween hands until a trifle thicker than a lead 
pencil then twist about each other. Let rise 
and bake as other rolls. When cool spread 
with powdered sugar which has been moist- 
ened with cream until of the right consist- 
ency to spread (about i/o tablespoon of cream 
to 1/2 cup sugar) and slightly flavored. 

Better than cookies, cheaper, and more 
wholesome.

2 tablespoons syrup 1 or 2 egg yolks 
% cake yeast % teaspoon cinnamon 

1 teaspoon salt About 2 cups flour 

6 tart apples 



Use just enough flour to make dough as 
stiff as it can be stirred ; beat well, turn into 
well-greased, shallow pan and let rise. When 
doubled in bulk press the core side of quar- 
tered apples well into the dough, covering 
the top. Bake until apples are tender and 
surrounding cake is brown. Serve hot with 
a sweet sauce, plain or whipped cream.

let stand two minutes, then add remaining 
ingredients, with enough flour to make dough 
as stiff as it can be stirred. Beat well, turn 
into well-greased individual bread pan, let 
rise until doubled in bulk and bake slowly one 
hour.

This makes a rather soft dough that is 
hard to handle, but the soft dough breads 
make a crisper toast than do stiff dough 
breads. The egg yolks make the bread very 
tender.

EGG DISHES 



FOAMY OMELET 



CRUMB OMELET 



5 eggB 



1 teaspoon salt 



Fold stiffly beaten whites to which salt has 
been added into unbeaten yolks. Turn gent- 
ly into a warm, well-greased frying pan or 
iron skillet (omelet pan may be used). Cook 
on top of stove slowly until the omelet can be 
raised slightly from the bottom of the pan. 
Place on rack in slow oven and continue cook- 
ing until crusted so that nothing sticks to 
the fingers when pressed lightly on the top. 
Remove from oven. Run knife or spatula 
around edge, lifting enough to make sure 
no parts are sticking. Crease across center of 
omelet at right angles to handle, cutting al- 
most to the bottom. Slip the first half onto 
a warm platter and fold the upper half over 
it. 

Serve all omelets with a sauce: tomato, 
cheese, ham or chicken (minced chicken 
mixed with gravy). 



5 tablespoons crumbs 
5 tablespoons boiling 
water 



1% teaspoons salt 
5 eggs 



Mix yolks with crumbs and pour boiling 
water over them; when cool fold in stiffly 
beaten whites, to which salt has been added, 
and cook according to directions for P^oamy 
Omelet. Serve with Ham Sauce. 

POTATO OMELET 

Into the pan in which omelet is to be baked 
put two tablespoons fat. Cover the bottom 
of pan with a thin layer of finely diced, 
cooked potatoes, and brown, stirring well to 
make sure no particles are sticking. Pour 
over these browned potatoes either the 
Foamy or Crumb Omelet mixture and. finish 
cooking according to directions for Foamy 
Omelet. 

Three eggs with the potatoes and a cheese 
sauce will make a good-sized dish.

JELLY OMELET 

Cook a Foamy or Crumb Omelet and just 
before folding spread with a tart jelly. This 
delights the children. 

PLAIN OMELET 



5 eggs 

1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons grated 

cheese 



5 tablespoons boiling 
water 



Beat eggs together, pour water over them, 
add salt. Cook in greased skillet on top of 
the stove until set, then sprinkle cheese over 
the top. Commencing at one side roll like 
jelly roll, slip on to hot platter, and serve 
with Tomato Sauce. 

CHEESE SOUFFLE 



1 cup White Sauce No. 

Three 
1 cup cheese 



4 eggs 

IM teaspoons salt 



Add the cheese, which has been cut, 
ground or grated, to the hot white sauce. 



stirring until melted. Do not allow to boil, as 
a high temperature will cause the cheese to 
become "stringy." Remove from stove. Add 
salt to whites of eggs and beat until stiff. 
Drop unbeaten yolks into the cheese mixture, 
beat until well incorporated, then fold in 
gently the stiffly beaten whites. Turn into 
a well-greased casserole or glass baking dish, 
place in a pan of boiling water, and bake in a 
slow oven until souffle shrinks a trifle ( about 
thirty-five minutes). This shrinkage is the 
only dependable test. If souffle is allowed to 
bake longer it will be dry ; if taken from the 
oven too soon, it will fall. 

With cheese souffle serve tomatoes as a sal- 
ad, a vegetable or sauce. 

PEANUT SOUFFLE 

1 cup Vi^hite Sauce No. 4 eggs

casionally to break them into flakes. When 
it is cooked to a light fluff'y mass, serve on 
toast. 

SCRAMBLED HAM AND EGGS ON TOAST 

2 cups White Sauce No. 2 eggs 

One Vi teaspoon salt (if 
% cup ground, cooked needed) 

ham 

Add the ham and eggs to the hot white 
sauce. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, un- 
til eggs are cooked in flakes thru the sauce. 
Pour over hot toast, and serve with baked 
apple. 

DILLIFIFFI TOAST 

2 cups White Sauce Xo. 3 hard cooked eggs 
One 1 teaspoon salt

CORN OYSTERS 



% cup crumbs 
% cup milk 
1 cup corn 



3 eggs 

1% teaspoons salt 



Mix together the crumbs, milk, corn and 
yolks of eggs. There should be just enough 
milk to moisten crumbs — if they are very 
dry a little more may be needed. Add salt 
to egg whites, beat until stiff and fold gently 
into first mixture. Drop by spoonfuls on 
greased griddle and fry slowly until browned, 
turn like griddle cakes. Do not over-cook.

CHEESE FONDU 



1 cup crumbs 

1 cup milk 

1 teaspoon salt 



2 eggs 

1 cup cheese 



Beat eggs, add other ingredients and bake 
in slow oven twenty-five minutes. 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Chief among meat substitutes are egg, 
milk, and cheese dishes ; but while their price 
is almost prohibitive and the supply is low, 
we must resort more to legumes and cereals. 
When substituting extensively for meat, 
however, whose protein is complete or effi- 
cient, we must remember that the protein of 
legumes and cereals is incomplete or ineffi- 
cient, and while the quantity of vegetables 
and cereals in the diet can be doubled with- 
out lowering its nutritive value, they must be 
wisely combined, so that their proteins sup- 
plement each other. Cereals should be com- 
bined with legumes, milk, cheese, eggs, or 
gelatin. Legumes should be combined with 
cereals, milk, cheese or eggs. 

A milk, milk and egg, or milk and cereal 
desert should be served with a dinner whose 
piece de resistance is a vegetable roast; or 
cheese may be combined with the roast and 
a brown sauce made of milk served with it.

BAKED SOY BEANS 



2 cups soy beans 
2% teaspoons salt 



3 tablespoons sorghum 
or Orleans molasses 
Water 



Soak beans over night. Simmer on top of 
stove two hours. Do not throw away any wa- 
ter in which they were soaked unless you 
care not for the dissolved minerals in that 
water. Add salt and molasses, and bake un- 
til supper time, adding water as needed. A 
long baking adds materially to their flavor, 
so have them at their best. A new bean cooks 
perfectly in this time, but more time will be 
required for older ones. When cooking these 
it is preferable to soak all day, cook all night 
in the tireless cooker, and all next day in 
either fireless or oven. But if you haven't a 
tireless do not be discouraged — just keep a- 
cooking on, cooking on. If well cooked, most 
people prefer soy beans to the baked navy 
beans. Since their starch content is low, the 
discomfort to the eater, caused by the pro- 
duction of gas, is less than with any other 
bean. Their fat content being high it is un- 



necessary to cook them with fat meat ; but it 
is well to add to them, about two hours be- 
fore serving, two cups of cooked rice, or to 
serve them with rice.

Dissolve cubes in the hot milk, and mix to- 
gether with all the ingredients. Moisture in 
these loaves depends much on condition of 
vegetables used. If they are very moist use 
less liquid than receipt specifies. They should 
be barely stiff enough to mold. 



VEGETABLE MEAT SUB- 
STITUTES 

MACARONI 

During this time of needed wheat conser- 
vation we must not forget when using mac- 
aroni, vermicelli and spaghetti that they are 
wheat products. Cook in an abundance of rap- 
idly boiling, salted water until very tender, 
about thirty minutes. Drain, saving the liq- 
uid for soups or gravies instead of water; 
flush macaroni with cold water and it is 
ready to use in many ways. It is a saving of 
labor and fuel to cook enough of any of these 
products for two meals, reserving half until 
the second or third day, and serving it then 
in a manner entirely different from the dish 
of the first day. Spaghetti, vermicelli, hom- 
iny or rice may be used instead of macaroni 
in any of these receipts.

MEAT .FLAVORED DISHES 

More palatable than most of the meat 
substitutes, and just as economical in the end 
are the meat-flavored dishes. Rather than 
serve a pound and a half of meat one day and 
none the next why not serve three-quarters 
each day ? Meat substitutes are relished part 
of the time, but meat flavored dishes all the 
time. These dishes make what Mrs. Fred- 
rick calls "The One-piece Meal."

in the tomato pulp until tender; if pimento, 
it is only necessary to heat all ingredients to- 
gether until very hot. Beef, dried beef, veal, 
mutton or chicken is best, but a combination 
of two or three left over meats may be used.

MEATS 



"Some hae meat and canna eat, 

And some would eat that want it; 
But we hae meat and we can eat. 
Sae let the Lord be thankit." 

— Burns. 



DRIED BEEF CHOWDER 



1 cup dried beef 

2 cups diced potatoes 

(cooked) 
1 teaspoon onion Juice 



2 cups White Sauce No. 
Two 

1 teaspoon salt 

2 cups croutons 



Heat first five ingredients together and 
serve over the croutons. 



Meats before using should be wiped with 
a clean cloth wrung out of cold water. If they 
are washed and stand in water the juices 
will be drawn out. 

Only the expensive cuts, coming from the 
little used muscles of the animal, can be suc- 
cessfully roasted or broiled. 

The cheaper cuts, which are just as nutri- 
tious, require a long, slow cooking to make 
them tender; hence they are rejected by 
many housewives. 



ROASTED MEAT 

Wipe meat, rub with salt, using 1/2 tea- 
spoon to the pound, lay in roaster, fat side 



Page Forty-one 



If a rich broth for soups is desired the 
meat should be put into cold salted water, 
gradually heated, and cooked until tender, 
but never allowed to boil. The broth thus ob- 
tained will be delicious while the meat will 
be tasteless, and can be used only in made- 
dishes combined with highly flavored vege- 
tables, or herbs. 

BRAISED MEAT 
Wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and dredge 
with flour. Brown quickly in v'ery hot greased 
pan. Remove to fireless cooker, kettle or 
large casserole, add three cups of boiling wa- 
ter, and cook below boiling point until tender 
— about fifty minutes to the pound. An hour 
before meat is done add six onions. 

BRAISED MEAT WITH VEBETABLES 
Follow directions for Braised Meat. One 
hour before meat is done add 



1 cup diced carrots 
1 cup diced turnips 
1 cup diced celery 
1 teaspoon salt 



% cup tomato pulp 
2 diced green peppers 

or pimentos 
1 cup diced potatoes 



up, and dredge with flour. Place in hot oven. 
When flour in pan is browned and meat is 
seared reduce temperature. Baste occasion- 
ally with fat that fries out during roasting. 
For a medium rare roast allow fifteen min- 
utes to the pound; for a roast well done, al- 
low twenty. 

BROILED STEAK 

Wipe steak. Rub heated pan or broiler with 
a piece of the fat. When pan is smoking hot 
lay in steak and turn every twelve seconds 
for the first two minutes, and every twenty 
seconds after that until it is done. Steak an 
inch thick will be cooked to a medium degree 
in ten minutes. Remove to hot platter, sprin- 
kle with salt and spread with butter. 

BOILED MEATS 
If the meat is to retain all the juices and 
be palatable it must be put into boiling wa- 
ter, boiled six minutes, then cooked below the 
boiling point until tender. When half cooked 
add Va teaspoon salt to the pound. 



Page Forty-two 



If potatoes are to be served as a separate 
dish do not add them to the meat. 



SWISS STEAK SUBSTITUTE 

The toughest cut of meat from the tough- 
est animal grown can be cooked tender by 
this method. Into any piece of meat, about 
two inches thick, pound aU the flour it will 
absorb. Lay in baking dish or fireless cooker 
kettle, over the top spread a cup tomatoes, 
add a cup and a half boiling water, cover and 
boil five minutes. Put into oven or cooker, 
and cook below the boiling point until tender. 
After meat has cooked an hour and a half, 
salt, using 1/2 teaspoon to the pound. Time 
required will depend entirely upon meat used. 
A cut two inches thick from the round will 
cook well in two and a half hours. Two table- 
spoons each diced onions and sweet peppers 
may be added with the tomatoes if desired. A 
stuffed flank, with flour rubbed in, instead of 
pounded in, can be well cooked by this 
method. 



BEEF EN CASSEROLE 

Cut meat into slices for serving. Sear 
quickly in a very hot, slightly greased skillet. 
Remove to casserole or cooker utensil and 
sprinkle with flour. Into skillet put enough 
water to come to top of meat ; when water is 
boiling, pour over the meat, let boil three 
minutes, cover and cook below boiling point, 
two hours in the oven or three in the fireless. 
Quartered potatoes may be added an hour be- 
fore serving time. Salt meat when adding 
potatoes. 



BEEF STEW

water into skillet in which meat was seared. 



Page Forty-three 



When boiling, puur over meat, scraping ail 
particles loose, and cook below boiling point 
three hours. Add more water as needed. An 
hour before serving time add the vegetables 
and salt. Fifteen minutes before serving 
thicken and add the dumplings, cover snug- 
ly and cook without removing cover. 

Of course when there is a scarcity of 
wheat, potatoes should be used in place of the 
dumplings.

mined only by age of fowl. Even a five-year- 
old hen, cooked after this method, would take 
herself for a spring fry. Salt when half 
cooked. Can be cooked to advantage in fire- 
less cooker. 

Chicken should never be cooked the same 
day it is killed. Soon after the fowl is killed, 
the muscles stiffen, and do not relax for 
about twenty hours. If cooked during this 
time it cannot possibly be made tender, al- 
though it is cooked until the meat falls from 
the bones. 



CHICKEN BAKED IN MILK 

Roll a disjointed chicken in flour or corn 
meal, brown quickly in greased skillet, and 
put into casserole. Blend two tablespoons

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups make excellent luncheon or 
supper dishes, but only clear soups should 
be served at dinner. Especially good for 
cream soups are baked beans, lima beans, 
peas, asparagus, celery, onions, tomatoes, 
spinach and corn. 

GENERAL RECEIPT FOR CREAM SOUP 

2 cups white sauce No. 1 teaspoon salt — if vege- 

two table was unsalted 

2 cups vegetable pulp Other seasoning to suit 
vegetable used 

Always add the hot vegetable pulp to the 
hot white sauce, seasoning just before serv- 
ing. Serve with croutons. 

TOMATO CREAM SOUP 



2 cups tomato pulp 

2 cups white sauce No.

1 stick celery 



1 slice onion 

1 teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon sugar 

1 or 2 bouillon cubes 



ery and onion fifteen minutes. Strain the 
two cups of hot pulp and add to the hot white 
sauce. (Do not put white sauce into tomato 
or it will curdle.) Drop in very slowly at first, 
while stirring constantly. One-fourth tea- 
spoon soda may be added to the tomatoes to 
decrease tendency to curdling, but it is not 
necessary if care is taken in the mixing. 
Just before serving add the cubes dissolved 
in a little of the hot soup, and the seasonings. 

Cubes may be omitted but they are a de- 
licious addition. 

TOMATO AND BEAN CREAM SOUP

Salt 

1 teaspoon onion juice 



2 tablespoons butter 

substitute 
1 cup hot milk

SOUPS WITH MEAT STOCK 



RIVEL SOUP 



Beef broth 

Seasonings 



1 small egg 
1 cup flour 



Drop the egg into the flour and rub well 
together, thus making the "rivels." Sprinkle 
these into the boiling broth and cook until 
very tender. 

DEMOCRAT NOODLES 

% cup flour Vi cup milk 

Mix together, using just enough milk to 
make a dough that can be rolled Vi "ich 
thick. Cut into narrow strips or inch squares 
and cook in broth like ordinary noodles. Most 
people undercook these noodles and rivels, 
consequently they are not as tender as they 
should be. If well cooked, they will be im- 
proved fifty per cent. 



SUGGESTIONS FOR VEGETABLE SOUP 

With or Without Meat Stock 

Almost any combination of vegetables can 
be used: left-over Egyptian rolls and the 
broth in which they were cooked; left-over 
Spanish rice, Macaroni Mac, hominy or spa- 
ghetti dishes; left-over vegetables cooked 
with Braised Meat, bits of carrots, onions, 
cabbage, tomatoes. In fact any of these left- 
overs can be made into a delicious soup with- 
out broth. Use % cup water for every per- 
son to be served, add left-overs, season well 
and just before serving add a bouillon cube 
(dissolved in a little of the hot soup) and 
1/2 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet for every pint 
water used. 

CROUTONS 

Cut left-over bits of bread into tiny cubes, 
dry in warming oven until crisp. Keep in can 
covered with cloth. When needed heat to 
restore crispness.

SALADS 



ECCO SALAD DRESSING 



3 tablespoons corn- 
starch 
3 tablespoons sugar 
2 cups weak vinegar 



2 egg yolks 
1 teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon mustard 
% teaspoon celery seed 
or celery salt 
Mix the dry ingredients together, moisten- 
ing with a half cup of the vinegar. Add them 
to the remainder of vinegar, boiling on the 
stove, and cook until thick and clear. \\Tiile 
beating constantly, pour a little of this thick- 
ened mixture into the well-beaten yolks of 
two eggs, stir until blended, and return to 
mixture on stove. Cook two minutes below 
the boiling point. Salad dressings are likely 
to curdle if raised to the boiling point after 
the eggs are added. 

GOLDEN OR FRUIT SALAD DRESSING 



2 whole eggs 

3 tablespoons lemon 

juice 



Vi cup sugar 
5 tablespoons pineapple 
juice 



Beat eggs, add other ingredients, cook over 
hot water until mixture coats the spoon like 
cream. Remove at once as there is enough 
heat in mixture to finish cooking. The juice 
of white cherries, pears, or oranges may be 
substituted for that of the pineapple. 

This may be served as it is or mixed with 
an equal amount of whipped cream. Good 
for all fruit, but not vegetable sala,ds. 

QUICK MAYONNAISE 



1 whole egg 

1 teaspoon sugar 

% teaspoon salt- 



2 tablespoons lemon 

juice or vinegar 
1 teaspoon mustard 
% cup oil 



Add the seasonings and a half tablespoon 
of the acid to the egg. Pour in a fourth of 
the oil and beat together; continue adding 
oil a quarter at a time until all is used, beat- 
ing between each addition, then add remain- 
der of acid. Can be made in three minutes. 
The secret of adding oil quickly, without 
curdling, is using the WHOLE egg. 



Page Fifty-two 



Because of the value of the green vege- 
tables in the diet a salad should be served 
at least once a day. 

All vegetables for salad should be crisp. If 
withered let stand in very cold water until 
freshened. Drain well before using. If they 
are not to be used at once, put into can or 
bucket with tight lid where they will keep 
crisp sesveral days. Lettuce can be kept in 
good condition two weeks if these directions 
are followed. 

All cooked dressings are much improved 
by the addition of whipped cream. Even a 
tablespoonful is worth adding, and one may 
use as much cream as dressing. 

Pimentos, both as a garnish and a flavor, 
help to make salads attractive. Put them into 
very weak vinegar and they will keep almost 
indefinitely if kept in a cool place. Pimentos 
which are to be used in other than salads 
should be covered with vegetable oil instead 
of vinegar. Even cabbage can be made into 
an attractive salad if it is finely shredded. 



heaped on lettuce leaves, capped with dress- 
ing, and garnished with pimentos. 

When mixing salads use just enough dress- 
ing to bind ingredients together, and mix 
just before serving or salad will become 
watery. 

It may sound aristocratic to talk of "May- 
onnaise," but, if referring to a boiled dress- 
ing, one is only showing one's ignorance, for 
a cooked dressing it NOT "Mayonnaise." 
Mayonnaise is a dressing made with egg and 
oil. 

Any left-overs of meat, vegetable or fruits 
can be made into a delightful salad if receipt 
for "Best Salad" is followed accurately.

FRUIT SALAD 

Pears, very ripe, or canned, make a splen- 
did economical foundation for almost any 
fruit salad. Apples and bananas are the oth- 
er foundation fruits. These three may be 
combined, in almost any proportion, into a 
very acceptable salad. White cherries, 
grapes, pineapple and oranges are the fruits 
that tone up and lend flavor to these more 
common foundation fruits. Golden Salad 
Dressing — alone or combined with whipped 
cream — will make any fruit or combination 
of fruits, into a delightful salad.

Sandwiches afford another method of util- 
izing left-overs. All bread for sandwiches 
should be thinly sliced. Do not remove 
crusts. Many of these may not SOUND good, 
but never mind the sound. Try them.

VEGETABLES 

Vegetables should be steamed, baked or 
stewed. If they are boiled and the water 
thrown away much of the flavoring and min- 
eral matter is lost. 

Vegetables which are steamed or baked 
retain all their nutritive value. If stewed 
vegetables are properly cooked, they, too, re- 
tain their nutritive value. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR STEWING 
VEGETABLES 

Put vegetables into boiling, salted water, 
using as little as possible to prevent burn- 
ing. Cook until tender, when water should 
be almost boiled away. If any liquid remains, 
use it in making a sauce to serve with vege- 
table. 

The best toast to serve with vegetables is 
made by spreading bread very lightly with 
butter substitute and putting into oven un- 
til slightly browned. 



CREAMED CABBAGE 

Simmer cabbage in as little salted water 
as possible, until tender. Using the liquid re- 
maining, and enough milk to make a cup, pre- 
pare a cup of white sauce No. 2 and serve 
over cabbage. 

CABBAGE AU GRATIN 



2 cups cooked cabbage 
1 cup crumbs 



2 cups white sauce 
2 tablespoons grated 
cheese 



Put two layers each cabbage and crumbs in 
baking dish, commencing with cabbage and 
topping with crumbs. Before putting on the 
last layer of crumbs pour the mixed white 
sauce and cheese into baking dish, add last 
layer of crumbs and bake in a very slow oven 
twenty minutes.

Peas, substituting corn for the peas. 

HARVARD BEETS 



Vz cup weak vinegar 
2 tablespoons flour 
1 tablespoon butter sub- 
stitute

add the mixed sugar and flour, cooking un- 
til thickened. Into this mixture put the diced

it will not boil, and let simmer fifteen min- 
utes. Add butter substitute and serve. To 
be used instead of salad. 



CREAMED CELERY AND CHARD 



2 cups diced celery 
1 cup white sauce No. 



1% teaspoons salt 
2 cups diced chard 
stems 



Cook celery and chard stems together ac- 
cording to directions for stewing vegetables. 
No one but the cook will know this is not all 
celery. 

RUTABAGA STRIPS 

Cut rutabaga into strips about a half inch 
wide and thick. Simmer in broth until ten- 
der. Lift from broth, add a tablespoon but- 
ter substitute and serve very hot. Broth may 
be used for soup.

See Braised Meat with Vegetables. 

GLAZED CARROTS, PARSNIPS OR 
SWEET POTATOES 

Slice vegetables in half-inch slices length- 
wise, or cut them into quarters and put into 
baking dish. For each pint of vegetables 
make the following sauce: 



1 cup hot water 
1 tablespoon flour 
^ teaspoon salt 



V2 cup syrup 
1 tablespoon butter sub- 
stitute

tle of the hot water and blend. 

Stir into the rest of the hot water and 
syrup and cook until thickened. Add salt, 
pour over vegetables and bake until tender.

mashed like potatoes. 



STUFFED PEPPERS 

Parboil peppers fifteen minutes. Stuff with 
left-over Spanish rice, Macaroni Mac, or 
minced meat mixed with crumbs. 

Bake ten minutes. 

POTATOES 

Potatoes should be cooked with the skins 
on whenever possible, for the mineral matter 
is thickest next the skin, and much is lost 
when the potatoes are pared. Even for mash- 
ing, potatoes should be cooked with the jack- 
ets on, drained, quickly pared and turned into 
a hot crock where they can be mashed with- 
out cooling. 

POTATO OR SWEET POTATO SOUFFLE 

(Good for the Sunday dinner) 

To every quart well-seasoned mashed po- 
tatoes add one stiffly beaten egg white. Heap 
in casserole or glass baking dish. Place in 
hot oven until browned and very hot. If po- 



Page Sixty-two 



tatoes are well-beaten, egg can be omitted. 
Potatoes may be prepared, put into baking 
dish and set aside several hours, then heated 
just before serving. 

SPECIAL BAKED POTATOES 

Split into halves good sized baked sweet 
or Irish potatoes. Remove potato from skin, 
mash, season and return to shell. A half hour 
before serving time place in oven to heat and 
brown. 

If Irish potatoes are used, a teaspoon on- 
ion juice should be added. 

POTATOES BAKED IN MILK 

Put a quart thinly sliced potatoes, sprin- 
kled with 2 teaspoons salt, into a baking dish, 
add hot milk to almost reach top, bake slowly 
until tender. Remove cover and brown. 



CAKES, GINGERBREADS AND 
COOKIES 

Only war-time cake receipts are given in 
this book. Should a receipt for a finer cake 
be needed, use any of those found on leaflet 
in the Cake Flour advertised in this book. 

"Fat" in these receipts means butter sub- 
stitute, Crisco, or vegetable oils. When us- 
ing an unsalted fat in cake add as much of 
a teaspoon of salt as you use of a cup of fat, 
thus: 1 cup fat requires 1 teaspoon salt; 
one-third cup fat requires one-third teaspoon 
salt. 

"Liquid" in these cake receipts means milk 
or water. Milk will increase the food value, 
while water will make the cake more tender. 

Flour quantities specified in these receipts 
are for cake flour. 

The best cakes cannot be made with ordi- 
nary sugar and hard wheat flour, but they 
demand a specially prepared sugar and cake 



Page Sixty-three 



flour. Flour and sugar should be sifted once 
before measuring. 

No definite time can be given for baking 
cakes without knowing exact depth of bat- 
ter in the pan. A medium layer cake should 
bake in twenty minutes, while a loaf cake 
requires from forty-five minutes to an hour. 

When cake shrinks from pan it is done. 
This test does not apply to pound or fruit 
cake; they must feel firm to the touch.

bakers. It is not in many stores but can be 
had at bakeries and will be handled by gro- 
cers when the demand warrants. It can be 
used instead of egg white in any receipt ex- 
cept scrambled eggs. We do not say it equals 
egg white in food value, for we have not 
learned its nutritive value; but we do know 
that products made from it appear and taste 
like those made from eggs.

WEAR WHITE SERPENTINE 

SAVE MONEY 

Eight Serpentine crepe house dresses will 
wear five years. 

Total cost, $11.20 

If four gingham dresses will wear one 
year, twenty will be need for five years. 

Total cost, $21.00 

Hence it will cost $1.96 less a year to have 
eight crepe dresses than it will to have four 
ginghams. 

Buy the lightest weight. Shrink before 
making. 

Cut with middle of gore on straight of 
good. 

THE FRANKLIN SHUMWAY CO. 

Boston 

373 Washington St. 

Will send samples upon request. 



CREPE HOUSE DRESSES 

SAVE TIME 

Eight crepe dresses can be made in eight 
day. 

Twenty gingham dresses can be made in 
twenty days. 

Twelve days saved. 

Seven crepe dresses can be washed in the 
washer, rinsed and hung over the line (by 
the belt), in twenty-five minutes. 

Three gingham dresses can be washed, 
rinsed, starched, hung, sprinkled and ironed 
in seventy minutes ; hence one can have a 
clean crepe dress every day with forty-five 
minutes less labor a week than one can have 
a clean gingham dress every other day.

ERRATA 

In our rush we have made mistakes ! The 
heading "Vegetable Meat Substitutes" on 
page thirty-three, should be in the place of 
"Meat Substitutes" on page thirty. 

Some old copy for "Crust for Meat Pie" 
and "Potato Crust" crept onto page nineteen. 
Ignore those and use receipts on page forty- 
five. 

The columns on page forty-one are trans- 
posed. The second column follows immedi- 
ately after page forty.

ORIGINAL RECEIPTS 

By Kathar>'n Romif< McMurray. Copyright 1917. 



Gener.\l Directions — Use wheat flour in reverse proportion to your patriotism! Since the substitute flours con- 
tain no gluten, wheat flour must be combined with them to produce an acceptable loaf. 

While 25 per cent substitute flour produces the best loaf, as high as 75 per cent can be successfully used. The 
higher the per cent of substitute the smaller the loaf, but the food value is no less and in some cases slightly higher. 

The higher the per cent of substitute flour used, the softer must be the dough. When less than 50 per cent it 
should be as soft as can be kneaded, when more it should be only as stiff as can be stirred with a heavy spoon. 

When mashed potato or cooked rice is the substitute the dough should be as stiff as that for ordinary white bread. 

All the substitute breads are just as good or possibly better if put into the baking pans as soon as stiffened, allowed 
to rise until almost doubled, then baked at a slightly lower temperature than wheat bread. 

Dry yeast can be used by making a sponge with the liquid and white flour at night and stiffening with the substi- 
tute in the morning.
