PREFACE. 



While gathering and formulating recipes C5oncemingthe 
preparation of fruits for her own private use, the author 
and compiler of the present book was struck by the fact 
that there existed no simple yet comprehensive work upon 
the subject. It is true that cook-books flood the market, 
but the major poi-tion of them deal with all sorts and con- 
ditio© s of materials. What appeared to be needed, was, 
first, a greater variety of dishes in which fruit enters as an 
ingredient and that are at once easily made, appetizing 
and wholesome ; secondly, such an arrangement as shall 
show at a glance the changes which may be rung upon 
any one kind of fruit. 

It is frequently the case that the housekeeper who is 
blessed with a superabundance of apples, peaches, pears, 
or dates, finds her household cloying upon the two or three 
modes in which they are usually served. Recipes for a 
dozen new dishes to be made out of the same fruit are then 
an acquisition, the value of which only a housekeeper can 
justly estimate. 

In the eight million and more kitchens which are the 
pivotal centers of the physical life and activity of our 
country, fruits are daily growing more important as a sta- 
ple article of food. And, as civilization advances they 



will take a still higher raak as their relatioas with health, 
temperance and economy will then be far better under- 
stood than they are to-day. 

In treating this subject an arbitrary classification seems 
necessary, as only tbose fruits which n^qnire cooking or 
are eaten in tbeir natuial state as dessert, demand atten* 
Hon.

INTKODUCTION. 



FRUIT AS FOOD. 

In that future toward which the eyes of both E«alists and 
Idealists are now dii'ected more eagerly than at any pre- 
ceding period, there can be no doubt that all things will 
be noted nearer their true worth than they aie to-day. In 
cooking especially, many compounds now in vogue will 
sink into disuse, but then* places will be filled with foods 
which are pleasant t*) the eye, delicious to the taste and 
yet easy to prepare. In all departments of t he household 
that beautiful and harmonious simplicity which is evidence 
of the highest cultme, must prevail, and it will be found 
that a simple, wholesome and appetizing dietary, one 
which can be prepared with eane and served with elegance, 
is that one in which Fruits will play a most important 
pait. 

The value of Fruits as Food is far from being generally 
understood. Grown in every •juarter of the globe, 
ripening in succession from early spring till winter, fra - 
grant, tootls me and p. ire. the fruits and their more solid 
cousins, the grains, afford every element needed for the 
norishment of the human frame. True, these elements 
are never found in a foi'm as concentrated as in the flesh 
of animals, and herein lios one mark of their superiority.

One of the greatest dangers of this age is that result- 
ing from too great concentratkn — whether it be found in so- 
cial life, in w ealth, or in food. On this point it is well t(» 
heed the words of Sir Henry Thomsou, one of the most 
distinguished of living physicians and an authority on all 
mattei s connected with dietetics. In " Food and Feeding" 
he writes: 

"Speaking in general terms, Man seems at the present 
time prone to choose foods which are unnecessarily con- 
centrated and too rich in nitrogenous and flesh-formmg 
material and to consume more in quantity thau is neces- 
sary for the healthy performance of animal functions. ♦ * * 
He makes very small account of the different requirements 
by the child, the mature person and the declining or 
aged person. As to the exercise of any taste in the 
serving or the combining of different foods at a meal, the 
subject is completely out of reajh of the majority of peo- 
ple and is as little comprehended by them as the structure 
and harmonies of a symphony are by the fii'st whistling 
boy one chances to meet upon the street. " 

There is no danger, according, to experience as well as 
chemical investigation, of a want of nutrimeut in a diet 
composed of fruits and grains; the trouble will be to dress 
and serve them so that they shall be suited to the eye audto 
the taste. When that is done there is no possibility of 
absorbing the germs of disease through bacteria or animal 
poison. From analysis it is found that wheat, apples, and 
berries; peaches and other stone fruits, furnish a rich, pure 
blood which nourishes strong muscles and a clean physical 
economy. 

It is useless to lay before the housekeeper a statement of 
the amount of carbon starch, albumen, and sugar furnished 
by this food and that; what she wishes is the very best 
nourishment for the brains and bodies of those to whom she 
ministers, and to know how to serve it in a mannerat once 



iNritODUca:iON. u 

healthful and delectable. Nature is a better chemist 
than man, and nature has packed within envelopes of vari- 
ous forms and hues those exquisite acids and sweets, flavors 
and essences, which in some subtle way sustain eveiy por- 
tion of the system from the hair of the head to the nails of 
the fingers and feet. 

Let us take the apple, for instance, which in Value ranks 
among fruits equal to wheat among cereals. It contains 
sugar, the malic and tannic acids, gluten, pectin, fibrin, 
starch, traces of free salts and water. B:it httle care the 
Jrosy, rounJ-cheeked children who live on apples almost en- 
tirely from the time the August pippin turns yellow till 
Christmas-tide; they only know that their favorite fruit, 
with bread and butter and an occasional potato satisfies 
every need. 

It appears in exi)eriments with Alexis St. Martin, that 
a ripe apple in a healthy stomach ought to digest within 
an hour and a half from the time it is eaten, and stoue 
fruits and berries in about the same length of time. In 
cases of poor digestion fruit ought to be taken with bread, 
not with vegetables or meats, or taken alone. Nor is fruit 
healthful to such when smothered with sugar and 
drenched in cream. It is only a perverted taste which 
demands sugar to make palatable perfectly ripened fruits 
and such a pei-son knows nothing of the enjoyment to be 
derived from unmixed natural flavors skillfully compoimd- 
ed by the Great Chemist in nature's own laboratory. 

In respect to food values scientists rank giapes next to 
apples. Schlickeyseu terms one the king of fruits, tlie 
other the queen; in that case the berriesmight be members 
of the royal family, peaches, pears and plums, members 
of the cabinet, and tropical fruits, the foreign ministers. 



12 FBCITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

To drop the simile and return to the value of fruit as 
food, it is only necessary to allude to the use made of the 
cocoanut, the date, the fig, the pineapple and the bread-fruit 
by the inhabitants of the zones where such luscious fruit- 
age freely flounshes. In the south of Europe figs consti- 
tute a large part of the dietary five months out of twelve. 
Arabs when crossing the desert will live for weeks upon a 
handful of dat<^s per day. When the public games of ancient 
Greece were first instituted the atheletea were trained en- 
tuelyon \egetable food. "At first," says KoUin, "they 
had no other nourishment but dried figs, nuts, soft cheese 
and a gross, heavy sort of bread." 

In every nation a simple diet is the food of strong, 
healthy muscular people. " With respect to the Moorish 
porters in Spain, " writes Capt. Chase, who commanded a 
merchant vessel which loaded at Spanish ports, " I have 
witnessed the exceedingly large loa«ls they are in the 
habit of carrying and have been struck with astonishment 
at their muscular powers. * * * They brought theii' food 
on boai'd with them which consisted of coarse brov\'n bread 
and grapes. " The modern Greeks are athletic and power- 
ful, yet thek food consists of black bread, a bunch of 
grapes and raisins and some figs, on which they breakfast 
and dine. The captain of a schooner seme time ago 
came into Portland laden with barilla from the Canary 
Islands. He declared that he saw "four stout American 
laborers attempt in vain to lift one of the masses of barilla 
which the captain and mate both solemnly affirmed was 
brought from the storehouse to the vessel by a single man, 
a native laborer, where they freighted, and he subsisted 
entirely on fruit and coarse vegetable food." The boat 
men of Constantinople rejoice in a splendid physical de- 



INTEODUCTION. 13 

velopment, yet their diet is chiefly bread with cherries, 
figs, dates, mulberries or other fruits. 

In short, the experience of mankind shows that simple 
food including much fruit, conduces to -strength and lon- 
gevity. 

HYGIENIC VALUE OP FRUIT. 

If it be generally known that all food is both nutritive 
and stimulative, it is not, certainly, remembered that on 
the proper balance between nutrition and stimulation, de- 
pends perfect enjoyment of existence and health. 

These, in fact, are synonymous terms. To feel an 
abounding and elastic vigor, to have a continual sense of 
power, to be able to use body and mind at will in a world 
where everything around and above incites to exertion 
and attainment, are certainly what should be eagerly 
sought. Much as has been said upon the subject of diet 
in this regard, the use of pui'e fruits and grains cannot be 
too much insisted upon. 

Among the authorities upon this subject are some of the 
most progressive physicians and scientists of the age. 

Writing to the " Medical Classics " very lately, Dr. Fer- 
dinand Seeger says : 

" It is an observation not less important than true, that 
by attending merely to a proper diet, a phlegmatic tem- 
perament may frequently be changed into a sanguine one, 
and the hypochondriac may be so altered as to become a 
cheerful member of society. The eating of fruit at the 
commencement of a meal, while it presents a bland or con- 
genial material to the delicate lining of the alimentary or- 
gans, forming a welcome precursor to more substantial ar- 
ticles, and is, to some extent, a safeguard against the over- 
feeding which comes from reserving the fruit till the 
stomach is akeady overlojvded with enough, perhaps too 



U FRUITS AND flOW TO USE THEM. 

much, of other food. Fruits should be ripe when eaten 
on an empty stomach and for their laxative effect should 
be eaten before an} thing else. In this way constipation 
may, with many individuals, be avoided, especially when 
the quantity of ot'ier articles of the meal is within reason- 
able limits." 

Dr. Seeger continues: 

"If our bihous friends would throw aside their liver 
pills and study nature in her most smiling and bounteous 
mood, would allow her to tempt them as Eve tempted old 
Adam, they would take to fruit, and by pleasant, natural 
and healthful methods, free themselves of the thick bilious 
impurities which make them a nuisance to themselves as 
well as to all around tbem. BiUousness is one of those 
demons that can be pretty well exorcised by proper diet 
and due amount of exercise. Acid and astringent fruit 
being rather a medicine than food, is less hurtful to the 
healthy, and to children, than is commonly supposed. In- 
stead of. being noxious, as some imagine, in inflanmiatory 
disorders, it is of the greatest service. Persons of a thick 
and languid blood cannot eat anything more conducive to 
health than fruit, as it possesses the property of attenu- 
ating and putting such blood in motion." 

In " Eating for Strength " Dr. Holbr^joks quotes from a 
physician as follows: 

"There is scarcely a disease to which the human family 
is heir, but the sufferings therefrom would be greatly re- 
lieved or entirely prevented by the use of fruits which are 
now so generally forbidden." He relates that during the 
war many of the troops who were sick with diarrhoea and 
dysentery cured those disorders by stealing from the 
hospitals into the fieldts and eating fruits, blackberries es- 
pecially. Children suffering with cholera infantum were 
sent to the peach orchards of Delaware with the most 
gratifying results; and in typhoid fever, that dread disease 
pften takes a more favorable course where the free use of 



INTRODUCTION. 15 

such fruits as peaches and grapes is allowed. In scarlet 
fever and diphtheria, native and foreign fi'uits are most 
useful. He concludes: " There is scarcely a disease ac- 
companie<l with fever but grapes and bananas may be free- 
ly given to the patient. In the treatment of dysentery I 
would very much prefer ripe, sound fruits, peaches espe- 
cially, to any medicine that can be suggested." 

Confirmatory of the therapeutic value of fruit is a re- 
markable cure recorded in an English Medical Journal, 
"The Lancet" some time ago. The case was that of a 
child three years of age who had been ill during half his 
lifetime. Covered from head to foot with ulcers, blind and 
in constant pain it seemed as if death alone could bring 
rehef . Eight eminent medical men had pronounced him in- 
curable and the ninth began his almost hopeless task with 
a determination to try the virtue of fruit. The boy's 
diet consisted almost entirely of ripe fruits and sugar or 
honey. He was allowed to eat grapes, cheiTies, apples, pears, 
plums and such other fruits as could be obtained, either 
in their natural state or cooked. 

Within three days the mass of nmning ulcers which 
covered the little body showed signs of amendment. He 
soon began to open his eyes for the first time in over a 
year, and at the end of three and a half months the child 
was pronounced cured. His skin had become remarkably 
*clear and fair while the swollen features had returned to 
their wonted appearance. Other noteworthy cases might 
be repeatedly cited, but all illustrate the same important 
principle. 

It is a curious fact that those who show high intelli- 
gence in other regards, are often lamentably deficient in 
respect to physical habits, especially to diet. 



16 FRUITS AND HO V TO USE I HEM- 

Although the climate of the United States incites to too 
rapid expenditures of vitality so that the " nervous Ameri- 
can temperament" has made for itself a name the world 
over, men usually eat and drink the most stimulating food 
they can procure. The serene, steady, self -poised person 
is the exception, ceiiiainly in towns and cities. The ex- 
citable temperament " grows by what it feeds upon" and 
the animal propensities are strengthened at the expense of 
the higher faculties. 

It would be bad enough were this state of things induced 
by a fierce struggle for existence, but such is not the case. 
With stc>res of fruitage from every country upon the earth, 
it must be conceded that choice, not compulsion, decide 
what shall be the dietary of our country people. 

To quote from Schlickeysen's " Fruit and Bread:" 

" The various grain foods in the form of puddings with 
fruit sauce will make an abundant dinner. Thus sup- 
ported by all the enlivening influences of light and air, 
the whole system improves as if infused with a new life. 
The muddy complexion clears, the pimples depart, sores 
heal and there is a pure, sweet taste in the mouth, in short 
a new man is bom. Tho advantages of this diet are so 
conspicuous that we williagly bjd deaanae to all those 
hindrances that obstruct its enjoyment." 

Among fruits the physiological «jffect, of grapes is most 
marked. Dr. Holbrook states that, "Eaten with other 
suitable food, and especially with bread, in quantities of from 
one to two pounds daily, they increase nutrition, promote 
secretion and excretion, improve the action of the liver, 
kidneys and bowels and add to the health." Great effica- 
cy has been attributed to the grape cure and it is used in 
a great variety of cases, such as consumption of the lungs, 
catarrh, affections of the liver, scrofula, asthma, and diseas 



IKTKODUCTION. 17 

es of the kidneys. The use of the grape juice also, is large- 
ly on the increase and it is recommended by physicians 
of every class. 

Regarding other fruits, it is hardly within the province 
of this book to mention the therapeutic qualities they are 
believed to possess. All the world highly esteems the prop- 
erties of the orange and greatly prizes the lemon and the 
lime; the strawberry has been known to cure malarial 
fevers, and figs and prunes, date3 and bananas, cherries 
and peaches are all distinguished for their healthful quali- 
ties. They should not be eaten uncooked after a hot 
meal, when the stomach is in a relaxed condition, but at 
proper seasons they can supersede the use of medicine. 

INCREASE IN THE USE OF FRUIT. 

To woman the increased culture of fruit is a peculiar 
blessing. Unless the housewife be hope)essly wedded to the 
old custom of providing heavy meats, rich puddings and 
dyspeptic pastry, there is no reason why she may not by 
the use of fruit, furnish a large and practically endless 
variety of dishes, one day after another, all through the 
year. 

The work of food preparation too,.is reduced to its mini- 
mum, and how vastly more agreeable to a woman of refine- 
ment IS the handling of fruits thtm that of a greasy animal 
food! 

To the horticulturist the world owes more than can be 
estimated. To tame straggling brajioles and wild tre?8 
into prolific subjection, and cause them to shower their 
melting and aromatic sweetness upon mankind, is to great- 
ly help the march of true civilization. 

Within the last decade a great change has taken pla?e 



18 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

ill regard to the use of fruit and the end is not yet 
reached. Time was when appJe orchards, and a few pear 
and plum trees with unkempt currant buehes were all 
that cotdd be found in large sections of most of the 
Northern States, and i^eaxihes and melons satisfied the 
gardeners of the south. Barefooted children and weary 
women, tin pails in hand, during the season wandered far 
and wide over rough pastures, through briers and up steep 
hillsides in search of wild berries. Then a little stewed 
sauce, some pies, and a few quaiis dried among the flies of 
the kitchen, were all that could be expected in the way of 
fruit, save the bins of Seek-uo-furthers and Greenings 
which were, indeed, a treasure. No, not quite all. Every 
thrifty housewife had a few jars of "preserves" made in 
the old way of " pound for pound. " They justified the 
name since they were " preserved" for such occasions as 
the " minister's " visits, company from a distance, or a quilt- 
ing bee. 

Happily all thii is changed. In every village lot ripen a 
few bushes or a bed of berries to which tiie youngsters have 
access, and outside of the great cities that family must be 
poor indeed which does not grow a quantity of fruit for the 
wiuter's use. It is marketed in such profusion and sold so 
cheap as to come within the reach of all, even foreign fruits 
having grown to be a necessity. Does one weary .of the 
uncooked berry or drupe ? There are preparations of gela- 
tines, creams, blanc-manges, tapiocas, custards, charlottes, 
meringues, batter puddings, baked puddings, roly-polys 
and short-cake whose number is almost legion. Nearly 
one hundred dishes can be made out of apple alone, to say 
nothing of all other kinds, natural and imported. The 
wholesome and aesthetic influence of their culture and 



IKT-IODUOTION. 19 

preparation is something which must appee.1 to all who 
possess delicate sensibilities or an appreciation of the beau- 
tiful. 

Itis impossible to obtain accurate data concerning the 
increase in the use of fruit, but it is certain to be greatly 
in excess of the popular estimate. The gentleman to 
whom was consigned, in 1871, the first car-load of Cali- 
fomia grapes, (or fruits of any kind), confidently asserts 
that there has beeo sold in the city of New York during 
*he year 1889, three times as much fruit as during the year 
1886. During the season from five to twenty-fire car-loads 
of fruit per week, shipped from or near the Pacific Coast, 
reached New York in 1889, and most of it was sold at auc- 
tion, a late and favorite method of disposing of this per- 
ishable commodity. On each car-load the freight alone 
amounts from $450, to as high as $600, or $700. 

Thiti estimate is for green fruit. Dried prunes, apricots, 
peaches and raisins annually increase at an enormous 
ratio aa gi'owers learn how to cure and pack in such a 
manner as to compete with foreign horticulturists. Hence 
the business of handling, as well as growing fruits, is as- 
suming vast proportions. All these facts indicate an 
amelioration of a heavy diet to one better fitted to the 
progress of the century. 

It has been anticipated that the large supply of western 
fruit might discourage the growers of the eastern portion 
of the Union, but that hardly seems imminent. While 
California fruit is large, smooth and attitictive in appear- 
ance, to many tastes it lacks that indescribable flavor 
which is the birthright of its cousin grown on the Atlan- 
tic slope. If one excels in size the other excels in intrin- 
sic richness and the world can spare neither. Besides,

the market grows as fast as the production, and through 
increased facilities for transportation every hamlet in the 
country teems with such lusciousuess as half a century 
ago it would be impossible for an e nperor to command. 

Fruit growing in Florida also shows an immense yearly 
increase. During the season of 1888-9, according to the 
Florida Finiit Exchange, 600,000 l>oxes of oranges were 
shipped to New York City alone. Of this fruit the first to 
arrive comes from Havana, followed by that from Jamai- 
ca and Porto Rico, afterward the productions of Florida 
and California. Then comes the Mediterranean oranges 
including those from Valencia, Messina, Palermo, Catania, 
Joppa, or the Holy Land, and Naples. The Sicilian 
oranges, from Palermo and Messina, are stored for summer 
use, thus not coming in competition with the fruit of our 
own country. 

As an evidence of the quantity of fruit now used it may 
be stated that the value of Green and Di-ied Fruit Impor- 
tations, including nuts, as reported at the Custom 
House at the end of the third week < f June 1889, amount- 
ed in round figures, to the sum of f 217,000. 

FRUIT AND TEMPER.1NCE. 

Many persons recognize only one kind of Intemperance, 
aamely, indulgence in alcoholic stimulants. In fact, in- 
temperance in the use of food, more often than otherwise, 
precedes indulgence in the use of liquor. Whip the di- 
gestive organs into excessiA^ activity by eating rich viands, 
condiments and spices, and after awhile they refuse to act 
except when spurred by stimulants. A morbid appetite 
is thus formed and in the struggle between appetite and 
principle, the weak will yields the struggle. 



INTBODUCTION. 21 

It seems unnecessary to review the powerful arguments 
on this poiiit which able writers have so often placed before 
the public, but wives and mothers cannot hear these les- 
sons too frequently. When housekeepers learn that un- 
due exhilaration is always ft)llowed by corresponding de- 
pression and that food and drink which tend t^ inflame 
or excite, create a thirst for beer, wine, or brandy, ^ey 
will forever dispense with highly spiced dishes. 

Dr. J. C. Jackson, a man of great experience in treating 
the intemperate, writes these startling words: 

"Drunkards are not made in saloons, they are simply 
graduated there. Thev take their initiation in their 
homes around their own tables. The father and mother 
lay in themselves the foundation and cany over to theii' 
children a constitutional liking for stimulants. This 
liking existing in the child as a tendency is developed 
under the table arrangements into an actual appetite. So 
from the eating of stimulating and exciting foods aflfecting 
the nerves of the stomach, arises an irritable condition ol 
the nerves of nutrition and, by reflex action, of the nerves 
of taste, till there is awakened a longing for something to 
overcome the feeling of exhaustion which, where stimu- 
lants are not in use, ia always noticeable and sometimes im- 
perious. " 

In the paper read heiore the British Association by C. 
V. G. Napier, F. G. S. that scientist took strong ground in 
regard to a farinaceous and fruit diet for the intemperate. 
He asserts that persons using such food without meats 
"feel no inclination for alcoholic liquors. I have noticed 
that a taste for spicy condiments, butcher's meat and alco- 
holic liquors is associated, and that a taste for plain-fla- 
vored vegetables, fats and oils, is likewise associated. I 
have known persons in the habit of taking alcoholic stim- 
ulants daily, when eating meat, who find they must give 
them up entirely when living without meats, their action

under those circumstances being too irritating to be en- 
dured without great inconvenience." 

One great help to the cause of temperance will doubt- 
less be in the growing use of unf erraented grape juice. 
It quenches the thirst and imparts buoyancy and strength 
without stimulation. It is nature's own wine aad the 
mcje men use the natural production of the "herb bearing 
seed and the tree producing fruit," the better for man- 
kind. 

It is believed by those who have carefully studied the 
subject that "not more than one in ten who diink do so 
solely because they relish liquors." Often they are in- 
temperate through unfortunate environm«ints; sometimes 
through absolute hunger for nourishing food. There is a 
gnawing sensation in the stomach which can at once be 
stifled by a dram. Could the man have a good savory 
meal he would forget the liquor, since his craving would 
be satipfiedii) the ooly natural and wholesome way. 

It follows that to know how to prepare good food, good 
in every sense and to every sense, is to know how to re- 
duce dyspepsia to a minimxma and to convert the incipi- 
ent drunkard into a sober, well nourished member of so- 
ciety. 

THE CULTURE AND PRESERVATION OP FRUIT BY WOMEN. 

With every passing year the struggle for existence 
among workers is growing more sharp and doubtful. In 
our own country the history of poi*r in cities is a sicken- 
ing blot upon Christian Civilization. Dragging out lives 
of destitution and horror, toiling with the needle in miser- 
able unventilated rooms, these poor creatures dumbly plead 
for opportunities for more than an animal existence. 

Many of them in this life are beyond and below such 



iNTRODtJCTION. S3 

help as the cultivation and preservation of fruit could 
offer; others have neither the money nor the desire for aoy 
other way of living than that of herding together iu mass- 
es ; but a certain percentage of the strongest and ablest 
could, once established in the counby, support themselves 
by such avocations. 

For instance, a thrifty woman rents or buys half an 
acre of land on which she plants half an acre of currants. 
They would require after that to be ploughed once a year 
and she would need help to pick tbem. If there is a 
glut in the market there is jelly or jam to be made and 
pure currant jelly is always in demand. Later on, 
spiced currants would find a ready sale. And this is only 
one of those small fruits which a woman can cultivate with 
far less expenditure of vitality than she is forced to spend 
in the use of the needle. 

To take care of fruit is fatiguing work but what work is 
not? With 80,000 superfluous women in one state alone, 
not all, but many of them, self-supporting, it is not to be 
supposed they shall find wojrk that is not laborious. That 
is not the question. It is. How shall women be able to se- 
cure the land and learn how to work it successfully ? To 
the thrifty and energetic alone will it be possible to find 
the way, and their number will be so limited by the na- 
ture of things that there can be no danger their ranks 
shall be overcrowded. 

Fruit culture by women is not a chimera. It has been 
successfully tried again and again. It does not pre-suppose 
that the culturist is compelled t) do all the hard work with 
her own hands any more than that the farmer must do 
all his w^ork without help. 

As an example of what hae been accompL'shed by one

deb'cately nurtured and pnysicalJy weak woman it is well 
to recall the life and labors of Miss M. F. Austin, former- 
ly a teacher in Nantucket and San Francisco, afterward a 
fruit-grower in Fresno County, California. There she 
purchased one hundred acres of land which she planted 
to vineyards and orchards of various kinds of fruit. "As- 
sociating herself in a co-operative home with two other 
teachers of kindred tastes," writes a friend after her 
death, "this blessed trinity remained unbroken for twenty 
years. In 1886, 6,000 boxes of raisins were raised, dried 
and packed and forty-five tons of apricots, fresh and dried, 
sent to market." 

Through attention to business, intelligence and pains- 
taking care these pioneer women made for themselves a 
beautiful home, where books, music and friends shed a 
grace over every function of life. Yerj lately two young 
women from Illinois have gone to Pasadena, Cal., and es- 
tablished a "Woman's Fruit Preserving Union. They con- 
duct the business themselves and have been successful, 
shipping goods to several of the large eastern cities. 

While perhaps no more marked instance of fruit grow- 
ing by women can be noted at present, it is true that num- 
bers have been successful on a smaller scale. Others 
have confined themselves to the making of jelly, jam, and 
mrjrmalade. One, residing in Brooklyn, N. Y., keeps a 
standing advertisement" all the year round in a daily pa- 
per, ofieriiig home-made fruit preparations, which command 
a good sale and a large price. Her articles, it need hard- 
ly be stated, are admirably prepared and attractive to the 
eye. 

Many others secure an income through the various 
Women's Exchanges which have come into vogue all over

the country. By this means they are save d from publici 
ty, which so many dread, and from the care of finding a 
market, at a cost of five per cent on all sales. It remains 
for some enterprising wonaan t3 start Fruit Exchanges 
where only this toothsome contribution to the dietary shall 
be handled, including the unfermented pure juice of the 
grape.

Of all the fruits of the earth none can vie with the apple 
in point of usefulness to the inhabitants of the North 
Temperate Zone. It may truthfully be said thnt the ap- 
ple holds the same relation to fruit that wheat holds to 
grains. Prepared in one form or another, .the palate 
never wearies of the dishes which grow out of it as a basis 
or ingredient. 

The apple tree is indigenous to the North as the orange 
is to the South. Travelers vie with each other in praising 
the beauty of the latter during the season of bloom, but 
there can hardly be seen upon all the round earth a fairer 
sight than an orchard in May-time. There is a piquant 
and peculiar richness in the fragrance, a hardy loveliness 
of bud and blossom upon the gnarled and ragged stems 
which the smoother and tamer oj-ange misses. Each has 
its own beauty and its own usefulness. Yet are we apt 
to under-rate that which is common, in favor of its distant

cousins. Those poets who see a charm in common things 
have sung of its beauty. Bryant's " Planting of the Apple 
Tree," is one of his best efforts. 

This tree, so slow and hardy in its growth will, under 
favorable conditions, witness the progress and decay of two 
centuries. It flourishes best in the United States in a 
belt limning from the Eastern States to the West. Be- 
ginning to ripen in June, the fresh fruit can be kept, with 
proper care, to the succeeding June. The evaporated ap- 
ple, carefully cooked, can hardly be distinguished from the 
fresh fruit, in place of which it can be used in the follow- 
ing recipes. Beloved of the robin and the bee, the small 
boy and the thrifty cook, the apple provides a large store 
of the winter's food and the summer's pleasui-e. 

It is curious to observe that the wild crab-apple f mnish- 
es all the stock from which the nearly 1200 cultivated va- 
rieties have sprung. It was propagated by the Romans, 
who however, knew little of the value of the fruit as now 
developed by careful nurture. 

Uncooked apples for eating ought to be perfectly ripe 
and only a very thin peeling should be removed. The 
more nutidtious and aromatic portion of this fruit lies 
nearest the surface, hence apples baked or stewed in their 
skins have a more delicious taste and quality than when 
pared. To one who has a reahzation of health and the 
sweetness of simple foods, there is nothing better than a 
juicy Poimd Sweeting, Baldwin, Russet, or Spitzenberg, 
out of which, with good, white- wheat bread and butter, a 
palatable luncheon may always be obtained. Chemist 3 
tell us that sugar, tannic acid, malic acid, albumen, glu- 
ten, pectin, fibrin, starch, traces of free salts and water, 
make up the bulk of apples, but rosy-cheeked, hardy chil- 
dren getlmg half their living from the products of the or- 
chard, are practical examples of their value. 



APPLES. 29 

Physiologists assert that apples ought to precede the 
meal, not follow it, and that they reed to be well masti- 
cated and insalivated. 

Apples and Cream.— Pare and slice fresh, mellow, sweet 
apples and pour over them sweet cream. Dust very lightly 
with sugar and serve for a breakfast dish with or before the 
cooked grains. 

Apples and Bread and Milk.— For this dish use per- 
fectly ript», mellow sweet apples. Pare and slice thin the 
uncooked apple into a bowl of rich milk and bread. For 
luncheon it is unrivalled. If preferred, bake the apple!:^, un- 
peeled, in a slow oven, till soft Then slice the fruit into 
the bread and milk. 

Apples Stewed, No. 1.— Take firm, sound sweet apples 
of the same size, cut out the blossom ends and simmer 
slowly in a little cold water, an hour, or till they are 
soft. Lift them out entire, sweeten the juice, if at all, very 
little, flavor with lemon peel if any is needed, and serve 
cold with their syrup. 

Apples Stewed, No. 2. — Wash, peel and core nice tart 
apples and stew in a little water till soft. Mash through a 
colander or coarse sieve, sweeten to taste and serve. A tri- 
fle of salt accentuates the flavor. 

Apples Stewed, No. 3.— Peel, core and quarter the ai - 
pies, dropping them into cold water to pervent discolora- 
tion. Make a s> rup of sugar and water, the sweetness pro 
portioned to the acidity of the apples, and let it come to a 
boii. Drop in the quarters, cover and cook till they are 
tender. Skim them out carefully and if the juice is very 
thin boil a little longer, then pour over the apples in the 
dish in which thoy are to be served. Season with nutmeg, 
cinnamon or lemon peel, or not at all. 



30 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Apples Stewed, No. 4.— Prepare as in No. 2. and cook 
the fruit in a pudding dish in the oven. Bake slowly and 
the fruit will turn a rich, deep red. They must he kept 
covered. 

Apples Stewed, No. 5.— Boil one gallon of sweet new 
cider till it is reduced one half, then throw in some quar- 
tered apples with sufficient sugar to sweeten them. Let 
them boil slowly till the fruit is tender, being careful that it 
does not scorch and that the quarters do not break in pieces. 
It is a rich dish. 

Apple Sauce with Boiled Cider, No. O.- Peel and 
core a peck of sweet apples and put in a preserving kettle 
with sufficient sweet cider to cover them. Cut fine four 
quinces and add to the apples. Boil for four hours, skim- 
ing often and adding a pound of sugar an hour before tak- 
ing from the range. Stir often to prevent browning. 

Apples Stewed, No. 7.— Pare and core large tart ap- 
ples, fill the centers with sugar and bits of butter, and ar- 
range in an earthen pudding dish and pour around them 
half a cup of hot water. Bake till soft, then mash them 
with a wooden spoon and sweeten and flavor to the taste. 

Apples and Quinces.— Pare, core, slice and stew until 
soft, half a dozen quinces, then add four or five times aiS 
many tart apples prepared for stewing. Simmer till soft, 
sweeten and press through a colander. Quince greatly im- 
proves the flavor. 

Apples and Raisins.— Wash, seed, and steep the rais- 
ins till they begin to be tender: then add pared, cored and 
quartered apples and stew until they begin to be soft. 
Sweeten to taste and if liked, flavor with lemon peel. There 
should be three times aiS many apples as raisins. Evapora- 
ted apples soaked over night and cooked with raisins are 
nearly as good as fresh. 



APPLES. SI 

Apples Frosted.— Peel, core and steam till tender, a 
plate of appJes with sugar. Beat the white of an e^g to a 
froth, adding two tablespoon fuls of sugar, and when stiff 
like icing, frost the apples and brown slightly in the oven. 

Apple Green-Caps.— (The Cook's Guide), fake sound 
apples, core without breaking and rub with clotli. Line a 
preserving pan with grape-vine leaves, place in the apples, 
c^ver with more leaves and cold water. Shut the lid, place 
an iron weight on it and simmer till the apples are cooked 
but whole. Remove and drain, smear each with the beat- 
en white of an egg and dredge thickly with powdered su- 
gar. Place them on a plate in the oven till frosted and 
sparkling. Arrange on a flat dish and place around them 
any pretty bright leaves. 

Apples Baked, No. 1 — Peel and core large sour apples 
and slice them into a granite or crockery dish, sprinkling 
each layer with suflftcient sugar to sweeten, with a dust of 
cinnamon or nutmeg. Add half a teacup of water to every 
quart of fruit, cover the dish with a plate, and bake slowly 
three hours. Let the apples cool in the same dish, and 
turn it out solid, like jelly, upon the plate in which it is to be 
served. 

Apples Baked, No. 2.— Wash either sweet or sonr ap- 
ples, selecting those of the same size and variety, and bake 
in a moderate oven till they are entirely soft, turning the dish 
from time to time, so that they will cook evenly. If they 
are soft, pour about them a little hot water when they are 
set in the oven. If sour, use more water and either sprinkle 
sugar into it or dig out the core and fill the aperture wiih 
sugar. They should not be baked in tin. The j nice makes 
a rich syrup which should be poured over the fruit after 
it is lifted into the dish in which it is served. 

Baked Apples, No. 3.— Take large tart apples of a uni- 
form size, wash, core and place side by side in a baking- 
dish. Fill ea<5h cavity with the best brown sugar, pour a 
cupful of hot wcvter In the pan and bake in a warm oven.

When thoroughly done remove each into a flat dish with 
the exception of the softest one of all, and with it leave the 
juice. Remove the skin of this and with a silver fork and 
spoon mash into pulp, stirring it into the juice and adding 
a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg, one teaspoonful of butter 
and a pinch of salt. Pour this over the apples in the dish 
in which they are to be served. If the pulp is not sweet 
enough add sugar to taste. When cold it makes a delicious 
jelly, and the whole dish is unlike the usual dry baked ap- 
ples which pass under that name. The addition of sweet 
cream makes the apples a perfect fruit. 

Apples Baked, No. 4,— Peel and core, filling the aper- 
tures with seeded raisins, bits of citron and sugar and d^ust 
of lemon peel. Bake in a slow oven after brushing the ap- 
ples with sweetened water and sprinkling them with fine 
bread crumbs browned in butter. Serve with cream. 

Apple Float.— Peel and grate firm, ripe tart apples, and 
chill them while beating the whites of four eggs to a stiff 
froth, adding three tablespoonfuls of sugar at the same 
time. Flavor the apples with lemon and stir into the beat- 
en egg. Again, stew the apples and strain, then mix with 
the pweetenedand beaten whites, using three or four eggs 
to one quart of stewed apples. Flavor with either orange 
or lemon. 

Apples and Cream.— Grate apples enough to make a 
pint of pulp and mix with a custard made with six eggs to 
a quart of milk. Serve with whipped cream. 

Apple Shape.— Take a pound of sugar to a half pint of 
water; boil and fckim; add one pound of pared apples, quart 
ered, and boil until tender and clear. Then add the juice 
of two lemons and the yellow rind (grated) of one of them, 
press through a sieve, together with half a box of gelatine; 
previously disolved. Stir until cool. Separate* four egga, 
beat whites to a stiff froth and mix it with the fruit syrup 
when suflftciently thickened and cool in a mould. The yolks 
of the egg make the sauce. 



APPLES. 83 

Apple Compote, Grerman Style.— (M<^. Bayard Tay- 
lor). Peel apples and remove the core so that the apple 
will remain whole and soak them a few minutes in cold wa- 
ter tinctured with lemon juice to prevent discoloration. 
Fill the cavities with jelly or sweet marmalade. Place 
them in a stewing pan and pour around them water enough 
to nearly reach the fillings. Add to the water half a pound 
of sugai and the thin peel of half a lemon. Cover tight arid 
boil till tender. Remove each apple carefully into a glass 
dish and pour over them a few spoonfuls of the liquor. 
Add a little sugar to the rest of the juice and boil to a jelly 
with which to garnish the apples. 

Apple Pie, No. l.~Line a de#^p pie-plate with paste and 
and heap it high with sliced tart apples cut thin. Over the 
layers scatter aoout four tablespoonfuls of sugar, small 
bits of butter and flavoring of cinnamon or nutmeg. Out 
a long narrow strip to press around the edge of the crust 
and over this press the upper crust to bind the two together. 
Prick the top with a fork or before putting it in place out 
a small cross in the center. This is the usual way of 
making a sliced apple pie, but it is better to put sugar and 
spices at the bottom before slicing in the apples. Bike for- 
ty minutes. 

Apple Pie, No. 2.— Prepare apples and paste and heap 
high the fruit in the crust without seasoning. As soon as 
it is done take the i ie from the oven, >ilip a knife between 
the crusts at the edge and carefully invert the top. Then 
with a silver knife and fork mash the steaming af»ple aui 
add sugar, a trifle of lemon or cinnamon and a teaspoon- 
ful of butter. A couple of tablespoonfuls of thick swdst 
cream are a great addition, but it is good without Serve 
warm. 

Apple Pie, No.4.— Take sour apples and peel, core, stew, 
sugar and strain them as for apple sauce; then bake between 
two cruste. 

Apple Pie, No, 5,— (Mrs, Potter).— A cupful and a half

of thick sour milk, half a cupful of sour cream or a dessert 
spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of soda, a pinch 
of salt and flour enough to make a stiff dou^h, will make 
crust enough for three or cour pies. Line the plates with 
the paste and before filing with sliced apples put into each 
plate two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one of flour and whatever 
spice is desired. Thoroughly mix these and spread evenly 
over the bottom era it. After the pUtei are filled with 
apples add one tablespDonf ul of molasses. 

Into the upper crust roll thin shavings of butter sprink^ 
led with flour, slash tiny holes for the steam to escape, cov- 
er the pies, wetting the edsres ana pressing them closely to- 
gether. Just before baking dash cold water over top crust, 
enough to throughly wat the flour. B;ike slowly three- 
fourths of an hour. When done, with a tiny nosed toy-tea- 
pot pour into the pie, through one of the slashes in the 
crust, two tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 

By stewing sugar aaJ fl>ur balow the apple instead of 
above it, there is less danger of escaping juice and the ap. 
pie is thoroughly cooked and deliciously flavored and jellied 
with the spicy thickened syrup boiling up through it. 

Apple and Pineapple Pie.— Peel and core apples and 
divide them into eighths, with which fill a pie plate lined 
with paste. Meantime take three tablespoonfuls of grated 
pineapple, one tablespoonful of water, and three of sugar, 
and simmer together till the fruit looks clear. When the 
apple pie is taken from the oven remove the top, spread 
over the apple with the pineapple, replace th^• cover and 
set the pie away to cool before it is served. The seasoned 
pineapple will sweeten the apple. 

Apple Custard Pie, No. 1.— Peel and grate sweet ap- 
ples enough to fill a large cup and pour over it enough hot 
milk to nearly fill, with the addition of the apples, a deep 
pie dish lined with paste. Beat it well, add one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar and one well-beaten egg. Flavor either with 
extract of lemon or half a teaspoonful of cinnamon or gin- 
geraccording to taste. Bake with oue crust

Apple Custard Ple,No 2.— (Mrs. Smith). Line a pie 
plate with paste and half fill it with thinly sliced apples. 
Over them pour a custard made with three eggs to a pint

oven. 

Apple Custard Pie, No 3.— Put through a colander 
one pint of stewed apples and stir into it three eggs, 
yolks and whites beaten together, half a teacup of rich 
sweet milk and a tablespoonful of warmed butter. Flavor 
with lemon or vanilla. Bake as in the preceding recipes, 
without an upper crust. 

Apple Meringue Pie,~Prepare the apple as in the 
receipe above and mix with it the beaten yolks of three 
eggs and sugar to taste. Bake in a deep pie dish lined 
with paste and when dope draw to edge of the oven and 
spread over the top the well- beaten whites of three eggb 
with as many tablespoonfuls of sugar. Return to the oven 
a few minutes to brown. 

Apple Turnovers, No 1.— Make paste as for pies ex- 
cept a little less short, as it will absorb some fat and roll 
out thin, about the size of a small dessert plate. Have ready 
nice, tart apple sauce seasoned to taste and drained of its 
juice and pile upcn half the pfiste. Fold the other half 
over this, wet the edges and press them together so that no 
fruit may escape. Drop them, one at a time into hot fat or 
drippings and fry brown. First, drop in a piece of bread 
and see if the fat is the right temperature. Dust with 
powdered sugar and serve warm or cold. They are more 
wholesome baked. Any kind of stewed fruit may be used 
in place of apple. 

Apple Turnovers, No 2.— (Miss ParJoa.) Mix one pint 
of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, two level teaspoon fuls 
of baking powder and tliree tablespoonf ols of sugar. Rub 
this mixture through asieve and then rub into it three table- 
spoonf uls of butter. Now beat an e^g till light and add to

it a generous half cupful of milk. Stir this liquid into the 
dry ingredients. Sprinkle the* moulding board with flour 
and roll the dough down to the thickness of a fourth of an 
inch. Cut this dough into cakes the size of a saucer. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of stewed, sweetened and seasoned 
apples on eiich piece of dough, fold over and roll up, pinch- 
ing the edges together. Have on the f.re a kettle contain- 
ing hot fat five or six inches deep. When the fat begins to 
smoke put in a few turnovers and cook for eight minutes. 
Drain on brown paper. The apple, used in turnovers, may 
be flavored with either cinnamon or nutmeg. 

Apple Pan Dowdy.— In the bottom of a deep baking- 
dish lay thin slices of buttered bread and let them extend 
up the sides. Fill in a layer of thin sliced apples, grate 
over nutmeg or sprinkle with cinnamon and turn over a 
cup of brown sugar melted in half as much hot water. 
Finish the top with another layer of buttered bread; 
cover it with an old plate and bake slowly an hour and a 
half. Invert it on a platter and serve hot with liquid sauce 
or erf am. 

Apples Coddled.— Peel and core sour apples and ar- 
range them in an earthern or porcelain dish low enough 
to allow them to be covered. Fill each cavity with sugar 
and dredge sugar over them. Pour in a cup of hot water, 
cover closely and simmer in the oven or on the back of the 
range till the apples are soft Lift them up without break- 
ing, dust nutmeg into the syrup and pour over them in the 
dish in which they are to be served. 

Evaporated Apple Pie.— Soak the apple over night 
and steam on the back of the stove till soit but unbroken. 
Line a pie-plate with paste and on it sprink e one half a 
cup of sugar. Arrange the sliced apple over this quite 
thickly, dust with nutmeg or add a little lemon juice, dot 
with bits of butter, cover with a crust and bake. 

Apple Dumplings, No !•— (Mrs. Campbell). Make a 



APPLES. 37 

bifclcuit crust or potato crust by addiut^^ to six large pota- 
toes, boiled and mashed, one cup of sifted flour and a tea- 
spoonful of cold water. Dredge the board with flour and 
roll out, leaving the middle portion thicker than the edges. 
Fill with apples peeled and quartered and gather the edges 
of the ptiste over them. Then scald a canton flannel pud- 
ding cloth three-fourths of a yard square, in boiling water. 
Wring it out, dredge it with flour and lay the pudding in 
it. Gather up the cloth, leaving room for the dumpling to 
swell and tie it very tightly. Boil for three hours. In 
turning out, press the water from the ends of the cloth, un- 
tie the bag and turn it away from the dumpling. Then in- 
vert a hot platter over it, turn the whole over again and 
serve at once. Steamed puddings or those boiled in a 
tightly covered tin pail are better than boiled dumplings, 
but some tastes cannot forego these old favorites. Apri- 
cots, peaches, plums, or blueberries, are good cooked in 
the same way. 

For sauce to eat with this and any other pudding, cream 
together half a cup of butter and a cup of sugar, beating 
till both are white. Set the bowl in a pan of water and let 
it melt slowly. Just before serving, stir in slowly half a 
cup of hot water and nutmeg or any flavor desired.

size of the apples. Put a pared and cored apple in the 
center of each circle of dough, fill the core aperture with 
sugar and a trifle of cinnamon, and carefully bring up the 
dough on either side and join together With a little pres-

Apple Tarts. — Roll thin strips of pie pastry and with a 
circular cookie cutter, make three times as many circles as 
are wfuited. With a smaller shd.pe cut out the center of 
two thirds of these and pile them on the remainder so that 
the tarts will have one thickness in the middle and three 
on the edge Bake and pile each cavity with rich apple 
sauce with a teaspoonful of whipped cream upon that. 
A ny stemmed fruit jam or jelly may be used instead of 
apples. 

Apple Pudding:, No. l.—Pare and slice six medium 
tart apples and stew in a little water till soft enough to 
mash. Into the sauc stir oue large tablespoonful of but- 
ter, three of sugar and the grated yellow rind and juice of 
one lemon. Into two cupfuls of grated bread-crumbs stir 
two tablespoon fuls of flour and mix with the apples and 
lastly mix in two well-beaten eggs. Bake forty minutes in 
a buttered pudding dish and serve with hard sauce. If it 
is too thick when mixe^l, add a trifle of water. 

Apple Pudding, No. 2.— Peel, core and chip five, six 
or eight sonr apples and. roll stale bread crumbs very fine. 
In a buttered pudding-dish strew a thin layer of bread- 
crumbs, then of apple and again of crumbs till the diah is

full, having crumbs at the top. Over' one cupful of good 
brown sugar and a rounded tablespoonful of butter, pour 
one cupful of hot water. Season with nutmeg, cinnamon 
or lemon-peel and pour over the crumbs and apples. Cov- 
er the pndding-dish, (one holding two quarts), with an in- 
verted plate, and let the crumbs soak half an hour. Bake 
forty minutes. This makes a good plain pudding with or 
without sauce. 

Apple Pudding, No. 3.— Prepare sour apples as in ITo. 
2, and mix with six large tablespoonfuls of grated bread- 
crumbs, three eggs, yolks and whites beaten together, two- 
thirds of a cup of sugar, half a cup of Zante currants, the 
same quantity of seeded raisins, one heaping tablespoonful 
of butter, three of flour, cinnamon or lemon-peel to taste 
and half a cupful of fruit juice of any kind or of dissolved 
cuiTant jelly. Stir in three tablespoonfuls of flour or enough 
for a thin batter and one dessert^spoonful of baking-pow- 
der. Steam in a mould or boil in a tin backet three hours. 

Apple and Rice Pudding, No. 4.— (Good Health) 
Steam one cupful of rice UU it is soft, with which line a but- 
tered pudding dish both on the sides and bottom, leaving 
a portion of rice for the top. Fill the space with thinly 
sliced or chopped tart apples and finish with the remainder 
of the rice, Put the dish in a steamer and steam till the 
apples are found to be tender by running a font into tlie.n. 
Set it away to cool and invert the dish so that the puddi \g 
will come out entire. Serve with sweetened cream, thin 
cugtard or fruit nauce, or garnish it with bits of apple 
jellyand pour cream over the whol\ 

Apple and Rice Pudding, No. 5.— Boil a cupful of 
rice in twice as much water for twenty minutes, then spread 
it on a buttered pudding cloth. In the center of this place 
two quarts of apples, peeled and cut in eighths, then tie up 
the ends and corners tight and plunge in a kettle of boiling 
water. Cook for an hour never allowing the water to 
cease boil'ng and serve with hot sauce. 



40 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Apple and Bread Pudding:, No. 6. -Dip thin slices 
of stale bread in cold water and then slightly batter them. 
Put a layer of bread on the bottom of a buttered pudding 
dish, then a thick layer cf sliced sour apples, sweetened to 
taste and seasoned with a sprinkling of cinnamon. H»>ve 
another layer of thread, then one of apples. Turn over a few 
tablespoonf uls of water, cover with an old plate and bake in 
a moderate ovei two hours. Serve warm with cream and 
sugar or liquid sauce. A richer pudding may be made 
with pouring over the pudding, in place of water, a cus- 
tard made with one egg, half a cup of milk and one table- 
spoonful of sugar. 

Apple Pudding*, No. 7.— Invert an old teacup in a two 
quart pudding-dish, then fill the dish nearly to the top with 
sliced tart and j uicy apples. For the crust take two cupf uls 
of flour and from two-thirds to a cupful of cold water, ac- 
cording to the strength of the flour. Stir with a spoon, 
add two tablespoonfuls of melted drippings or butter and 
sift in at the last two full teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Roll with as little handling as possible to the size of the top 
of the pudding-dish, cut a cross through the center and 
pi ess firmly around the edges. Bake half an hour in a hot 
oven. Cut in sections and invert the crust on dessert plate . 
Lift out the tea-cup which will be found filled with juice 
leaving the crust light and dry. Heap on the crust the 
apples and juice and sertre with cream and sugar or any 
favorite liquid sauce. It is a delicious substitute for appl e 
pie. A variety of th's pudding is made by adding a cup of 
sugar to the crust. 

Apple Batter Pudding, No 8.— Make a batter of half 
a pound of flour and a scant pint of milk, with which, 
stir the beaten yolks of three eggs and a large teaspoouf ul 
of baking-powder. In a shallow dish filled an inch and a 
half deep with sliced and seasoned tart apples, pour over 
the mixed batter and bake from thirty to forty minutes. 
Pour over the crust the meringue made of the beaton whii es, 
and three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and set in the oven to 
brown lightly- 



APPLES. 41 

Some prefer to mix the choppsd apples with the batter 
before baking. 

Apple Pudding, No 9.— Cook in a farina kettle two 
qu£Lrts of rich milk with a pint of yellow flint coarse Indian 
meal till it thickens. Take from the Are, stir in an additional 
quart of cold milk, two-thirds of a cupful of sugar, two table- 
apoonfuls of white flour, and lastly, one quart of, finely 
chopped tart apples and two spoonfuls of cinnamon. Pour 
into a deep pudding dish and bake slowly. Stir often dur- 
ing the first hour, then bake two hours longer. It is best 
to cook it in a shallow pan of water. Eat with or without 
liquid sauce. 

Apple Almond Pudding:, No 10.— (The Cook). Peel 
and gj'ate fine, eight or nine tart apples; blanch and pound 
fine half a pound of sweet almonds; mix the almonds with 
the grated apples. Add a little nutmeg, lemon-rind, half a 
teanpoonf ul of butter and sweeten to taste. When all these 
ingredients are thoroughly mix^d together, add to them 
four well beaten eggs. Butter well a deep dish and place 
the mixture in it. Put in a good oven, bake until quite 
brown on both top and bottom. As soon as done turn it 
out on a platter and eat hot with lemon sauce. It may be 
preferred cold. 

Apple and Tapioca, No 11. -Soak a teacupfal of 
tapioca in four cups of water for three hours stir into it 
two large spoonfuls of sugar, and keep it in a warm place. 
P^Ua two quart pudding dish three-fourths full of peeled 
and quartered apples. Pour over the tapioca, which mu£t 
have been kept on the back of the stove, and bake in a 
moderate oven one hour. Serve with any favorite liquid 
sauce or with sweetened cream. Peel and core the apples 
and cook them whole, if preferred. 

Apple Manioca Pudding, No 17.- Mix four table- 
spoonfuls of manioca with one quart of water, in a farina 
kettle, beat until it thickens. When it cools stir in two eggs

beaten together and one tablespoonful of butter, and sweet- 
en to taste. In the bottom of a pudding dish place a layer 
of stewed and sweetened eighths of apples, flavor with 
lemon, pour over the manioca and bake. 

Sweet Apple Pudding, No 12.— (Dr. Dodds). 

3 quarts new milk. 

1 quart sweet apple, finely chopped. 

^ cup sugar. 

1 pint (nearly), coarse corn meal. 

Single handful white flour. 

Time— three to four 'lours, slow oven. 
Pare, core and slice the sweet apples, and chop them fine, 
having a full quart in all. Then put into a stone or earthen 
crock, or a farina-kettle, two quarts of the milk; if new milk 
cannot be had, add a cap of cream to the skimmed. Set 
it on the stove, and bring just to a boil : if heated in a crock, 
see that the millc does not ocorch in the least. Then stir in 
tiie corn meal, and beat very thoroug;hly to remove lumps. 
The batter, when the meal has havi time to swell, should be 
almost too thick to pour, or about the consistency of good 
corn mush. Let /he mixture again come to a boil, and 
cook, stirring five to seven minutes; then remove from the 
fire, and add the quart of cold milk: this will make the 
batter thin enough to pour readily. Now stir in the apples, 
sugar and flour, and beat well. If the mixing has been 
done in a crock, set it directly into the oven; if in a farina 
kettle, pour the batter into a deep pudding-dish, and set ii. 
in the oven within a dripping-pan containing a pint or 
more of boiling water. Bake slowly, stirring seyeral time ^ 
the first hour; the pudding should cook from three to four 
hours in all, and be moderately browned on top when 
done. 

This excellent dessert is served cold or warm (not hot), 
and without a dressing; though the juices of certain fruiti*, 
as raspberries, cherries, etc., make a very good sauce for it. 
In the mixing, molasses or syrup may be used instead of 



APPLES. 4S 

sugar; but the pudding is less delicate to the taste. And 
when sweet ap>ples are not to be had, those of a mild but 
rich sub-acid flavor can be substituted. 

Orated Apple Pudding, No. 13.— (Dr. Dodds). 

2 cups sour cream— or part sour milk. 

3 cups grated (or scraped) apples, rather tart 
2 cups sifted white flour. 

1 tablespoonful fine corn meal. 

2 tablespoonf uls sugar. 

1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in boiling water. 

3 eggs, yolks and whites separate. 
Time— 40 to 50 minutes, slow oven. 

Beat the yolks, whip the sugar into them, add the cream, 
apples, meal and flour, and stir well; then add the whites 
cut to a. stiff froth, and also the dissolved soda, and beat 
thoroughly. Pour into a shallow pan, well oiled, and place 
immediately in a very moderate oven; or a better way is to 
set the dish in a dripping-pan containing boiling water. 
Bake from forty to fifty minutes. The pudding should not 
be more than an inch and a half or two inches thick when 
done; and it should be delicately browned, top and bot- 
tom. 

Apple Puddingy No. 14.— Peel, core and stew whole 
in a very little water enough apples of a uniform size to fill 
the bottom of a flat pudding -dTsh, tart apples are best 
Enough sugar should be sprinkled over them just before 
they are tender to season, perhaps two or three t»sblespoon- 
fuls. Take them out of the stew-pan without breaking 
them and arrange them in the pudding-dish. Make a 
custard of a pint of milk and the yolks of three egsi;s by 
heating the milk and very gradually pouring on the yolks, 
a spoonful at a time, to prevent the curdling of the eggs. 
A heaping tablespoonful of sugar should be beaten with 
every yolk. Fill the core apertures with jam, jelly, marma* 
Ifide or preserves of any kind, or with stoned and chopped 
raisins, or dates; pour over the whole the custard and bake 
till it is set, about a quar'.er of an hour. Cover the top

tabiespoonf uis of powdered sugar and set back in the oven 
for three minutes to brown. Chill on the ice before serv- 
ing. 

Apple Pudding, No 16.— Beat two eggs light, stir in a 
pint of milk, flour enough for a moderately thick batter 
and a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, then mix in 
one pint of tart chopped apples. Boil in a pudding mould 
or covered tin pail and serve with hard sauce, or with 
liquid sauce flavored with jelly. 

Apple (Marlborougli) Pudding, No 16.— Beat light 
the yolk^* of six eggs, gradually beating in two cups of sugar, 
stir in one quart of milk and a teaspoonful of vanilla or 
lemon flavoring. Take a pint of plain, unsweetened apple 
sauce in which, while warm, a tabiespoonf ul of butter has 
been melted, mix with the custard, pour in a pudding-dish 
and bake in a quick oven from thirty to forly minutes. 
Beat the six whites of eggs till they are very stiff, gradually 
adding six tablespoon fuls of sugar, for a meringue. Pile 
them on the pudding and set back in the oven with the 
door left open, to brown. 

Apple Slump.— This old-fashioned New England dish 
is made by paring, coring and quartering a dozen Rhode 
Island Greenings or any other tart and juicy apples. 
Turn over them half a pint of hot water and stew in a ket- 
tle on the back of the stove. In five minutes pour over 
them two teacapfuls of molas-ses, not syrup. Then make 
a crust of a heaping pint of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of 
sii^ar and two of baking-powder with sufficient sweet milk 
to make a soft dough. Roll this out and cover over the 
apples, which should be tender but not broken. Cover the 
kettle closely and let it cook for twenty-five minutes with- 
out lifting the cover. A good sauce is made by creaming 
a cupful of sugar with half as much butter and stir into it. 
just before serving, a scant cupf al of either boiling milk or 
water with seasoning to taste. 



APPLES. 45 

Apple Eggs-— Pe<*l and core six or eight apples, fill the 
cavities with sugar, ixrrange in an earthen baking-dish and 
pour around them a cup of boiling water. When baked 
pour over them four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separ- 
ately, as for an omelet, and then cut into each other. Re- 
turn to the oven till the eggs ai*e set. 

Apple Croquettes, — (Miss Parloa, in Good Housekeep- 
ing). Put one tablespoonful of water in the bottom of a 
sauce- pan, then put in a quart of pared, cored and sliced 
apples, seasoning, butter and sugar. Cover and place it 
where the apples will cook slowly. Mix one teaspoonful 
of coro-starch with a secon<l tablespoonful of water. When 
the apples are tender add the corn-starch and stir wall. 
Cook ten minutes longer. Beat two eggs well and stir 
them into the apple, ci ok for one minute longer, stirring 
all the time. Rub this mixture through a strainer, letting 
it fall on a buttered dish. Set away to cool; when cold 
shape into cylindrical form, roll in beaten egg and then in 
bread crumbs. Pry in fat for one minute and a half. 
Drain well and roll in powdered sus'ar. Serve hot. They 
are nice with roast duck or goose. 

Apple Soup.— (Ge- man). Boil together two tablespoon- 
f uls of washed rice, a teaspoonful of salt, six tart apples cut 
fine, leaving the peelings on, and two quarts of water. 
Cook halt an hour, then rub through a sieve and return to 
the fire, adding haif a teaspoonful of cinnamon, one cupful 
of sugar and a handful of finely cut citron. Boil t,ogether 
three minutes and serve. 

Apple Omelet.— Beat four eggs stiff, whites and yolks 
separately, and cut the former into the latter at the same 
lime sifting in two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
Pour into a greased spider and as soon as it thickens 
spread quickly with apple sauce sweetened to taste. Fold 
over, turn on a platter and serve at once. 

Apple Fritters.— Into two beaten eggs stir one cup of

sweet milk and a pint and a half of flour with three tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder. Mix in a scant pint of peeled, 
cored, and chopped apples and fry in hot fat, or, slice the 
apples thin and drop the slices into the batter. 

Apple Graham Pudding,— Mix together three cnp- 
fuls of sifted Graham flour and one and one-half quarts 
of sweet milk; stir in the beaten yolks of three eggs» 
one quart finely chopped apples and then the stiff b'^aten 
whites. Beat well together, pour into a buttered pudding 
dish and bake slowly an hour and a half. 

Apple Bread.— (Dr. Hoi brook.) Weigh one pound ct 
fres]^, juicy apples, peel, core and stew them to a pulp in a 
porcelain kettle. Mix the pulp with two pounds of the best 
flour; put in the same quantity of yeast as would be used 
in common bread and as much water as will make a fine, 
smooth dough. Put into an iron pan and place in a warm 
place to rise and let it remain twalve hours at least Form 
into rather long shaped loaves and bake in a quick oven. 

Apple Pone.— Pare and chop a quart of sweet apples. 
Scald a quart of corn maal with a pint of boiling water, add 
new milk enough to make a stiff batter, then stir in the 
apples. Bake slowly in a close vessel three hours, or boil 
the same length of time, in a pudding b£tg, or steam in a 
mould. 

Apple Brown Bread.- Into stewed and strained ap 
pie sauce, sweetened a little if the apples are sour, work 
with the hands equal parts of corn and rye meal till the 
mass is of a moderate consistency. Thin with water if the 
apples are not juicy, and bake. 

Apples Au Burre.- Peel and remove the cores from 
some fine flavored apples. Cut slices of bread the size of 
the diameter of the apple and lay them on the bottom of a 
well-buttered dish; on each slice place an apple; fill the 
aperture with brown sugar and a small bit of butter. Set 



APPLES. 47 

in a moderate oven and bake one-half hour, renewing sug- 
ar once or twice. 

Apple Tart,— Slice up one or more nice, tart apples in 
a saucer, sweeten with white sugar, and cover with a mod- 
erately thick slice of bread buttered slightly on the under 
side. When the bread is browned, the apples, if of a ten- 
der kind, will be done. 

Apples Fried, No. 1.— Wash and dry fair tart apples, re- 
moving the stems and blossom ends, core, but leave them 
entire Slice th n and drop into a .-pider oiled or buttered, 
when the fat is hot. Turn to prevent scorching, and when 
tender and brown serve at once. 

Apples Fried, No. 2.— Peel and core sour apples, tnen 
divide them into eighths, and sprinkle them with sugar, 
flour and bread crumbs. Cover the bottom of a stew-pan 
with a small piece of butter; when melted cover it with 
sUces of apples, and fry yellow on both sides. When done 
place in a saucepan son^e milk, sugar, bread crumbs and 
currants; put the fried apples in, and let them boil up 
without breaking. Serve hot with the sauce left in the 
saucepan. 

Apples Whipped.— One pint of the pulp of roasted ap- 
pUs strained, one-half pint of pulverized sugar, the whites 
oi three eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
then add a spoonful of apple and a spoonful of sugar alter- 
nately, beating all together until the mixture stands per- 
fectly stiff on the spoon. It will swell very much. Make a 
boiled custard of the three yolks of eggs, one pint of milk, 
two tablespoont'uls of sugar and flavor with vanilla. 
Place the custard in <»aucers, cover with the apple-sauce 
and serve. 

Apple Cake, No. 1. (Helen Campbell.)— One quart of 
flour, one teaspoonl ul of salt and two of baking-powder sift- 
ed with the flour, one pint of sour, tender, peeled apples cut 



48 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE TH GM. 

in thin slices; half a cup of butter, two eggs, two cups of 
sweet milk, two cups of sugar. 

Cream the butter and add sugar and yolks of eggs; etir 
in the milk and add the flour slowly, then add the stiflf 
beaten whites of the eggs. Dust the apples with flour and 
stir them in last of all ; fill the pans three-quarters full and 
bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. 

Huckleberry cake may be made from the same recipe. 
Have the berries picked over, washed, dried and dusted 
with flour. It will take a pint. 

Apple Cake, No 2. — Wash clean two cups of sliced dried 
apple, and doak over night; in the morning chop one half of 
them, and stew them all slowly in two cups of molasses, un- 
til they are dark. One cup of butter, two of sugar, two of 
chopped raisins, two-thirds of a cup of sour milk, four eggs, 
one teaspoon ful ofsaleratus, five cups of flour, and all kinds 
of spice. Put together as directed for other cakes, and stir 
in the apple and raisins last. Bake in loaves in a moder- 
ate oven, from two hours and a half to three. 

Apple Tarts.— Line deep patty- ins with thin pastry 
and on them spread sour apples cut into eighths and then 
cut in two. Pile up high, sprinkle with sugar and on each 
pour a teaspoorjful of water flavored with lemon. Bake 
and serve with a tablespoonful of whipped cream on each 
tart. A deep pie- plate may be used instead of patty-i-^ans. 

Apples Oelatined.— Pare and core medium-sized tart 
apples and simmer till tender. Make a syrup of one^half 
I)ound of sugar for every pound of fruit with the liquor re- 
maining after skimming out the apples. Boil and skim, 
drop in the apples which must be kept entire, and cook 
till they are clear. Slice a lemon for every six apples, take 
out the seeds> and cook the s ices with the fruit. Skim out 
the apples and arrange in the dish on wliieh they are to be 
served, place a slice of lemon on each apple, and into the 
syrup pour an ounce of gelatine which has been previously 
dissolved in half a cupful of cold water. Stir till smooth and 



APPLES. 49 

strain over the fruit Set away to cool, and serve with cream. 
One ounce of gelatine will be sufficient for six or eight ap- 
ples. 

Apple Charlotte, — Butter a deep dish, cut smooth slices 
of bread and spread them with butter, and line the«bottom 
and sides. Fill it with sliced sour apples. Sprinkle each 
layer of apples with brown sugar, also a few small bite of 
butter and season as wished. Soak some slices of bread in 
milk or water, lay them on the top and cover them with a 
plate and lay a weight upon that Bake two and a half 
houi s in a moderate oven. It should turn out w hole. Serve 
with cold sauce. 

Apple Butter.— Take sweet cider from the press, not 
more than a day old or alcohol will begin to form and the 
cider will have lost it f»-uity quality. Boil it down one-half 
and then add apples, pared, cored and sliced. There should 
be, by measure, slightly more than half as much apple as 
of boiled cider. Cook slowly and carefully, skimming when- 
ever necessary, and stir with a long wooden paddle which 
reaches the bottom of the kettle. The apple is broken into 
one homogeneous mass like marmalade. When it begins to 
break sweeten to taste : it is more wholesome and appetizing 
if left quite tart Good brown sugar is better than white. 
It can be kept any length of time in stone jars or wooden 
pails or firkins if thoroughly cooked. The usual apple but- 
ter sold in gfroceries is made insipid by too much sugar. 
The old-fashioned apple butter, less rich but more palatable, 
preserves the very essence of the apple. Season with spice 
to taste, if spices are desired, but^the apple flavor is itself 
incomparable.

THE APRICOT. 

•' Pure saffron mixed with clearest amber stained. 
The apricots." 

This delightful fruit, in genu^? nearly allied to the plum, 
is less widely kn«)wn than that of the peach which in many 
respects it closely resembles. In color a velvety yellow 
with the cheek exposed to the sun of a ruddy brown, it 
gives hardly a promise of the delicate flavor of the pulp. 
The apricot is propagated by budding on the stalk of the 
plum, wild cherry- or peach. Like its kindred drupes it 
belongs to the order Eosaceae, and the blossoms appear be- 
fore leaves are visible. A native of Armenia, it is culti- 
vated in the United States and Europe not only for its 
flavor but because it ripens in June, before the peach 
comes into market. 

But few recipes for the use of the apricot are given 
since in all cases it may be substituted for the peach, which 
is more universally cultivated. 

Apricots with Rice.— Wash a cupful of rioe and sim- 
mer in a farina boiler in a quart of new milk till soft and 
the milk absorbed, with a piece of lemon peel whicli must 
then be removed. Cool the rice a little and mix in four eggs 
beaten with as many tablespoonfula of sugar; set it on the 
fire and let it come to a boil. Tarn the rice into a round 
deep dish into the middle of which set a lar^e deep cup with- 
out a handle. Smooth off the sides of the rice and set away 
to cool. When cold remove the cup and fill the cavity with 
stev/ed and sweetened apricots flavored with a trifle of 
l^mon-juice. Serve with or without whipped cream piled

around the rice. Jt is needless to say that stewed or cannea 
peaches, quinces, jelly, or jam or marmalade, may replace 
the apricots. 

Apricot Fritters.— To the beaten yolks o'' three e^gs, 
add nine tablespoonfuls of milk and st-r in half a pint of 
flour. Hplit the apricots in two, dust with sugar, dip two 
pieces at a time in the batter and fry in hot lard. 



THE BANANA. 

Among: the most important of all fruits is the banana. 
It is the especial food of the inhabitants of many tropical 
countries, since it grows nipidly and bears luxuriantly. 
It reaches a height of fifteen or twenty feet, the stem 
terminating in a tuft of leaves from five to ten feet in 
length and a foot wide. The whole plant makes a salient 
feature of the southern landscape. 

No other plant yields so large a pupply of nutriment, 
and according to Humboldt a given amount of laiid which 
would yield thirty-eight pounds of wheat or more than 
eleven times that weight of potato, would produce four 
thousand pounds of bananas. In its constituents it close- 
ly resembles the potato. With a little salt meat or fish 
the native West Indian thrives on bananas, and when 
compelled by necessity performs a good deal of labor upon 
that as a staple article of food. 

Everj' year witnesses increased importations of bananas 
untill in the vicinity of the seaboard they can be pur- 
chased, in their season, from twelve to twenty-five cents per 
dozen. As a consequence new methods of cooking this es- 
culent are continually sought. 

Nor is this a matter of wonder. Bananas are readily

transported so that the route from New York to the Rocky 
Mountams is strewn with long, thickly studded stalks of 
this favorite fruit. "It is destined to be the fruit of the 
future," said one large importer. "Only one-teuth of 
bananas shippvjd perish before reaching the pui chaser, 
a less percentage than that of any other tropical fresh 
fruit. Then it is cheap and easily handled. A lady can 
peel the banana without removing or soiling her gloves, a 
fact which has an influence in its favor." 

It may be also added that housekeepers are learning 
various ways of using the banana. As it ripens every 
month of the year there is no day when it may not be 
seen upon the breakfast table or used as a portion of the 
dessert. Diuing the year 1889 the consumption of the 
banana is stated by imj»orters to be fully 33 1-3 per cent 
or one-third more than that of the year preceding. It is 
chiefly brought to our ports from the Bahamas and Cuba. 

!Bananas and Cream. —Peel, slice across the fruit and 
serve with powdered sugar and cream. 

Bananas and Oranges.— Peel and slice six bananas, 
sprinkle with sugar and with a little orange juice between 
the layers, using one large or two small oranges for six ba- 
nanas. Chill on the ice and serve with whipped cream. 

Banana Fritters, No. 1.— (Mrs. Keeler.) Beat till light 
the yolks of two egrgs, then add two large bananas cut in 
small pieces and beat tJll the mixture becomes a pulp. 
Add a teaspoonful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of butter, a 
scant half cupful of milk, the whites of the two eggs beaten 
stiff and one and one-half cupf ub* of flour with a scant tea 
spoonful of baking powder. Beat all well together with an 
egg-beater. Drop from the spoon into deep hot fat and 
fry a light brown. They should be like a puff-ball. Serve 
with half cupful each of sugar, butter and cieam, creamed, 
the two first and then the last, with vanilla. 



BANANAS. 63 

Banana Fritters, No. 2.— Beat together three eggs, 
stir in two cupfuls of milk and thicken with one pint of 
flour. Stir in two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder 
and two thinly sliced bananas. Fry at once. 

Bauau^ Fritters, No. 3.— (Miss Parloa.) Pare and cut 
six bananas in slices about half an inch thick; put these in 
a bowl and sprinkle over them two tablespoonf uls of sugar 
and the juice of half an orange. Let this stand an hour or 
^ore. Beat two eggs light and add to them half a cupful 
of milk; pour this mixture gradually on one cupful of flour 
and beat very smooth. Now add one tablespoonf ul of olive 
oil or molted butter and half a teaspoouf ul of salt. Drop a 
few pieces of the banana in this; when each piece has been 
perfectly mashed with the butter, drop them, one by one, 
into boiling fat and cook until a delicate brown ; it will not 
take more than two minut-es. Takf from the fat and drain on 
brown paper. Sprinkle sugar over them and serve imme- 
diately. The fat must be hot enough to float the fritters 
and about as hot as for frying doughnuts. 

Baked Bananas.— Peel bananas and split lengthwise 
in halves, and place them, flat side down in a large baking 
dish. Sprinkle thickly with sugar a trifle of salt and cin- 
namon and dot with small pieces of butter. Pour half a 
t«a-cup of water into the pan, being careful not to pour it 
on the fruit, and brown in a hot oven. 

Banana Pudding.— Line a glass dish with thin slices 
of plain cake and cover them with thin slices of banana. 
Have a second layer of cake and banana then pour over them 
a very thin boiled oustard. Serve wi th whipped cream piled 
on the top. 

Banana Blr^nc Mange.— Into a quart of boiling milk 
stir four tablespoonf uls of corn-starch wet with a little milk 
and a quarter of a cupful of sugar. When it thickens set 
aside to cool. When cold stir in a scant teaspoonful of 
vanilla and two or three thinly sliced bananas. 

Banana Short-Cake.— Cream one-half cup butter and

one cup of sucrar, stir in one beaten egg, half a cup of milk, 
two cups of flour and two tftaspooafuls of baking-powder. 
Bake in two round or oblong tins. Over one cake spread a 
pint of; whipped cream sweetened to taste, into which has 
been stirred one large banana sliced very thin. Lay the 
other over it and serve hot. / 

Hanana Gems. — Beat together one cupful of sugar with 
three eggs, add one-fourth of a cupful ot water and stir in 
one cupful of flour mixed with one teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. Stir in two thinly sliced bananas, and half fil! 
cups which should be steamed one hour. 

Banana Pie.— Beat the yolks of two e/args to a cream 
with one-half cup of sugar. Peel and ma»h two large 
bananas or three small ones, sift them and beat into the 
eggs together with one and one-half cups of milk or enough 
for a large pie. Bake with one crust, and when done cover 
with a meringue made of the two whites and two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Serve cold. Double the quantity baked 
in a deep dish without the paste, will make a pudding. 

Fried Bananas, No. 1.— (Miss Parloa) For six bananas 
put two tablespoonf Ills of butter in a cup and place on a 
part of the stove where it will heat almost to the boiling 
point; keep it at this temperature for fifteen minutes. At 
the end of this time a clear oil will be on the top and a 
sediment at the botton. Pare the bananas and cut them 
in two lengthwise; roll these pieces lightly in flour. Now 
pour the butter into the frying-pan being careful not to 
pour in the sediment: let this butter get hot and then put 
the slices of floured banana into the pan. Fry brown on 
both sides, place on a hot dish, sprinkle with sugar and 
serve. (If a sauce is desired boil together half a cup of 
sugar and the same amount of water, flavor with anything 
liked, likf orange or wine, and pour over it.) 

Fried Bananas, No. 2.— Beat one egg to a froth into 
which dip scarcely ripe bananas cut in two lengthwise. 
Roll in sugar and flour, and fry brown.

THE BLACKBERRY. 

This bramble, commonly found by the roadside and past- 
ure lands of the country, has proved itself capable of re- 
markable development throigh cultivatiou. The stout 
prickles remain, but by proper enrichment of soil and 
"pinching in" during summer the size and productiveness 
of the berry has greatly increased. 

Botany decides that the fruit is not a berry but a col- 
lection of drupes or seeds with one cell having each a sin- 
gle seed or kernel. But the term berry is popularly ap- 
plied to several other small fruits which are not really ber- 
ries, like the strawberry, which bears seec^s upon the sur- 
face of a pulpy receptacle. However it will always be 
known as a beriy and so this pleasant edible which is con- 
sumed in its natural state or in puddings, pies, jams and 
jellies, conudces as much to the dietary of the summer 
under one name as another. When fully ripe it is exceed- 
ingly wholesome and palatable, as also, the other fruits in- 
clu(ied under the term berries. 

Blackberries, (Ripe) Select lar^^e, perfectly ripe berries, 
spriDkle them v^ith sugar and smoth^^r them with whipped 
cream. Without the cream they may be eaten with sugar 
alone, or with a little thin syrup of sugar and water. They 
are excellent stewed, and make nice jam andj elly, pudding 
and pie. 

Blackberry Pudding, No. 1— Beafc three eggs, whites 
and yolks together, until light ; into which stir two teacups of 



56 FfiUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

milk, three and a half of flour, a pinch of salt, one tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter and two heaping teaspoonf uls of bak- 
ing-power, beating all the time as the ingredients are added. 
Without delay stir in a pint of blackberries and turn the 
batter into a greased mould. Cover clonely, stand in a ket- 
tle of boiling water and steam for three hours. Huckle- 
berries, cherries, raspberries or finely cut peaches or ap- 
ples may be made by this recipe. With any juicy fruit 
like cherries, for instance, drain the stoned fruit and thick- 
en the juice with corn-starch or arrowroot, as describf^d in 
the recipe for peach pudding, for the sauce. 

Blackberry Pudding, No 2.— Into a pint of boiling 
milk stir two tablesiK)onfuls of corn-starch made smooth 
. with a little cold milk. Then stir in two eggs beaten with 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, or more if it is desired very 
sweer. Spread a cupful of blackberry jeUy or jam in the 
bottom of a pudding-dish and over it pour the corn-starch 
and bake. Another variety is to use the yolks of four eggs 
with the corn-starch, and when it is baked (with the jam at 
the bottom of the dish) make a meringue of the whites and 
sugar. Brown five minutes in the oven, and just before 
serving dot the top with several teas )oonf uls of jelly. Any 
fruit, jam, or jelly is good with this pudding. 

Blackberry Pudding, No 3.— Cream together a cup- 
ful of butter and a pint of good brown sugar, stir in four 
. well beaten eggs and flour enough to make moderately thick. 
Pour the batter into a buttered pudding-dish and lightly lay 
over it a quart of ripe selected black berries. Do not stir 
them in but bake at once. Eat with sweet cream or liquid 
sauce. 

Blackberry Roll.— Roll biscuit dough half an inch 
thick, spread with stewed blackberries and steam in a 
floured cloth. Leave plenty of room to swell and serve with 
liquid sauce.

lain kettle, heating it slowly. Then thicken it with Graham 
flour taking care there are no lamps, using one cup of sifted 
Graham to the above amount of water and fruit. Stir in 
also one cup of sifted white flour, cover the kettle closely 
and set it where the mush will continue to cook but wi 11 
not scorch. Let it remain about ten minutes, stirring once 
or twice, then set it back on the stove and in a few minutes 
pour into a mould to cool. Dip the latter into cold water 
before filling it* Serve with mock cream, or cream and 
sugar. 

Blackberry Minute Pudding. —Steep a heaping half- 
pint of blackberries in one full pint of water ten minutes. 
Make smooth four tablespoonf uls of flour in a 1 ittle cold water 
and pour into the berries and boil, stirring carefully, till 
it thickens and the flour is well cooked. Serve with sweeten- 
ed cream while warm, or mould in pudding cups and turn 
out to eat cold. 



THE CHERKY. 

The cultivated cherry is supposed to have its origin in 
Asia, though there are numerous species of wild-cherry in- 
digenous to this continent. What country-bred child has 
not made wry acquaintance with the choke-cherry and its 
native black cousin 1 

From the Old World came the Ox-heart, the Duke, the 
Bigaroon, the Morello and others, yet they flourish apace 
in all our land. Loved of the marauding bee and cUmb- 
ing boy, in their tops the robin swings and sings his joy 
that Nature has here so plenteously furnished her family 
with store of food. Before a leaf has put forth its tender 
shoot the sfcarry blossoms burst out in riotous joy that 
spring has come, till the tree is one huge bouquet of milky 
whiteness underneath which even the night becomes a

luminous haze. How swiftly the green fruit grows and 
blushes red beneath the ardent kisses of the sun till the 
entire tree drips with its pendulous globules of luscious 
fruitage and anon the season is over. For most perish- 
able and swift-growing of all the offerings of the year, 
the cherry must be eaten only when it is perfectly ripe 
and used without delay. For a few days nothing can be 
more lovely in the way of fruit than a branch of Duke's or 
Morellos, with their clustered globes mingled with brilli- 
ant leafage. 

Less than many other fruits does the cherry pai't with 
its flavor in cooking, so thit in pie, pudding or padding- 
sauce, in cocsomes and with spices, it still retains an appe- 
tizing individuality. It is especially fine for canning pur- 



Cherry Pudding, (Boiled)— Beat three eggs entire, 
then stir in two cups of milk and a little less than a quart 
of flour, enough to make a smooth batter, — a tablespoontul 
of melted butter or drippings, and lastly press through a 
sieve a trifle of salt and twoheapin^c teaspoonful^f of baking- 
powder. Beat thoroughly and then mix in a pint of stoned 
cherries irained of their juice and dredged with flour. 
Turn at once into a buttered pudding-mould, or kettle, and 
cook in a kettle of boiling water for three hours. It must 
not stop boiling during that time. Serve with sauce for 
pudding. 

Cherry Pudding, (Baked)— Beat together two table- 
spoonfuld of butter and four of sugar, and ihe yolks of tvvo 
eggs; stir in two cupfuls of sweet milk, the beaten whites of 
the two eggs, and lastly two teacupfuls of flour into which 
two heaping tea^poonfuls of baking-powder have been sift- 
ed. Intx) the bottom of a largo pudding -dish place a layer of 
pitted cherries a liitle over an inch thick. Th^y should be 
sweetened and the juice drained out. Over them pour the 
batter and bake at once. For the sauce, take two cupfuls

of the cherry-juice, thicken with a heaping tablespoonful 
of corn-starch, and boil in granitized iron or a farina kettle. 
Sweeten with two thirds of a cup of sugar. 

Cherry Pie, No 1.— Stone the common or sour cherries, 
which have a richer flavor than finer varieties, with which 
nearly fill a deep pic-plate lined with plain paste, after lightly 
washing over the crust with the white of an egfc to prevent 
soaking. Over the cherries spread from one-half to two- 
thirds of a cupful of sugar and dredge lightly with flour. 
Cover with a thin upper crust with a cross cut in the cen- 
ter and press the edge firmly upon a thin strip of paste be- 
tween the two crusts to retain the 3 nice. Bake half an hour 
and when done dredge the pie with powdered sugar. Serve 
warm or cold. 

Cherry Pie, No 2.— Line a very deep pie-plate with 
pastry, measure out one teacupful of sugar and spread 
half of it over this. On that spi inkle evenly one-half of two 
soda crackers rolled fine, and over that a teacupful of pit- 
ted cherries. Dot the fruit with fine pieces of butter, then 
put on the remainder of the sugar, then the crackers and 
again a teacupful of cherries. Pour over all a teacupful of 
cold water, and at once cover with the upper layer of pas- 
try, prick with a fork and bake in a mo'derate oven half an 
hour. Dried cherries are almost as good as fresh baked 
after this rule. Soak them a few hours and drain off the 
juice, which is to be added in place of water before putting 
on the upper crust 

Cherry Toast,~Toast thin slices of stale bread and 
spread over them, while hot, a trifle of butter. Stew one 
quart of cherries either with or without the pics, adding 
half a cup of water, and pour over the toast in alternate 
layers of bread and fruit Set away and serve cold. 
The cherries while warm should be sugared to tsste.

ries; then dough enough to half fill the eupe. Set them in a 
pan of hot water, put that in the oven, cover it and steam 
half an hour. Eat with cherry sauce or sweet cream. 

Cherry Tapioca,— Mash one cup of tapioca and soak 
it in two cups of cold water several hours, then simmer 
it slowly in a pint of water till the tapioca is clear. Into the 
hot tapioca stir a large cupful of stoned cherries and sweet- 
en to taste. Turn into a dish and set away to cool. Serve 
with sweet cream. In the same way make stewed apple 
tapioca, or orange, raspberry, strawberry, peach, apricot or 
plum. In this manner can be used any kind of jam or jel- 
ly, whatever may i e left from partly used cans or glasaes of 
jelly. 



CHOCOLATE. 

Chocolate and cocoa are both made from the seeds of 
the cacao tree which grows in the West Indies and Cen- 
tral and South America. It is an evergreen bearing flow- 
ers and fruit during the entire year. The beans are im- 
ported in a long -pod containing each twenty or thirty 
beans in a sweet pulp. They are stripped from the pod, 
dried, roasted, ground by revolving grindstones, and sift- 
en, after which the oily pulp is mixed with sugar, vanilla, 
cinnamon and cloves to make the chocolate of commerce. 
The partly dried pulp is pressed in moulds to expel the 
air and harden it into a mass, after it has been beaten and 
worked into a smooth even paste. It is sometimes adul- 
terated with rice-meal, oat-mfeal, flour or roasted hazel- 
nuts. Mexicans are fond of mixing it with maize-meal 
and spices. When not excessively sweet and spicy choc- 
olate is nuti'itious and wholesome. 



CHOCOLATE. . 61 

Chocolate Cake, No. 1. —Cream together three-fourths 
of a pint of powdered sugar and half a cup of butter, and 
to it add one quarter of a pound of grated chocolate, five 
tablespoonf uls of sugar and three tablespoonf uls of water, 
whicii have been stirred together over the fire till smooth.

the same quantity of grated chocolate. Boil in a small sauce- 
pan, set in a larger till it thickens, then set aside to cool^ 
Cream together one cupful of sugar, one-half cup of butter, 
stir in one-half cup of milk and two and one-half cupf uls of 
flour with two full teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Flavor 
with two teaspoonfuls vanilla and stir in the perfectly cold 
chocolate mixture. Bake in jelly tins and between the lay- 
ers put boiled frosting. To make this boil two cups of sug- 
ar and one-half a cup of water to a syrup then pour very 
slowly on the whites of two eggs beaten very stiff, beating 
all the while. Add a pinch of citric acid while beating. 
When cold spread over each layer. 

Chocolate Pudding, (Good.)-Boil one pint of new milk 
in a farina kettle and while boilitfg stir in three tablespoon- 
f uls of corn-starch or four of flour made smooth in two ta- 
blespoonfuls of cold milk. Mix in five tablespoonfuls of 
sugar after the milk has thickened, one-half cup of grated 
chocolate and two well-beaten eggs. Let it cook a few mo- 
ments, just enough to set the eggs, then pour into a mould 
or the dish in which it is to be served. Cool on the ice and 
eat with egg sauce. Make thi ^ by boiling a pint of milk 
with a half teacup of sugar, and pouring in a little at a 
time, beating well, on the yolks of the beaten eggs. Flavor 
with vanilla.

three whites of eggs. Roll the mixture down to the thick- 
ness of alx>ut one-quarter of an inch; cufc it in small round 
pieces with a paste cutter, either plain or scalloped ; butter 
a pan slightly and dust it with flour and sugar, half of each; 
place the i^ieces of paste or mixture in and bake in a hot, 
but not quick oven. Serve cold. 

Chocolate Pie.— Measure out one cup and a half of mUk 
with three tablespoonfuls of which mix three even tea- 
spooufuls of flour. Heat the remainder of the milk in a 
farina kettle and put one half square of grated unsweeten- 
ed chocolate in a cup in the oven or in boiling water. 
When the milk comes to a boil tunj it over the thickening, 
put back on the stove and stir till it is smooth, then pour it 
over two eggs beaten light with one half cup of sugar. Stir 
slowly till the egg is smooth, remove from the fire and mix 
in the melted chocolate with one scant teaspoonful of 
vanilla. When nearly cool bake in one crust and cover 
with a meringue of the whites of two eggs beaten with two 
tablespoonf uls of sugar. Brown slightly and cool before 
serving. Increase the quantity and bake in a deep dish 
without pastry if a pudding is desired. 

Chocolate Cookies.— Beat together one scant cup of but.- 
ter and two of bSit brown sugar and mix with the beaten 
yolks of four eggs, then the beaten whites. Stir in three

bhapes and bake like other cookies. 



THE COCOANUT. 

In the Isles of the Navigator?, as in other tropical countries, 
nothing contributes so Icirgely to the necessities of the peo- 
ple as- the cocoanut. The Samoan chiefs assert that it was 
sent direct from Heaven* A visiti^r at the southern zone 



COCOANUT. 63 

writes, " Nothiug is more acceptable to a tongue parched 
with tropical heat than its cool, palatable and refreshing 
milk, while its soft tender meat is fit for a meal. " 

The tree, which grows to the height of sixty to ninty feet, 
affords a large variety of useful productions. The nut is 
eaten both unripe and ripe, and the oil expressed from it is 
used both as food and for the purposes of illumination. 
The rich, sweet flavor of the cocoannt gi\es it an impor- 
tance in the cuisine which is scarcely indicated in the ac- 
companying recipes since it is chiefly used in cakes and 
custards. 

The cultivation of the cocoanut has been successfully be- 
gun in the south(^rn portion of Florida. The best trees 
produce about two hundred nuts per year. They ai'e 
planted twenty feet apart and require little cultivation. 
The cocoa-tree is a graceful and beautiful tree even though 
it does not come to fruitage. About 19,00,0000 cocoanuts 
entered the port of New York in the year 1889. 

Cocoanut Pudding, No 1. (Helen Campbell.)— Soak 
one heaping cup of fine bread crumbs in a pint of milk, and 
cream together one cup of granulated sugar and butter the 
size of an egg. Add four well- beaten eggs, atablespoonful of 
rose-water, half a teaspoonf ul of salt, a fourth of a grated 
nutmeg, undone freshly grated cocoanut or two cupfuls of 
the desiccated which have been soaked in milk an hour 
before using. Bake slowly one hour. Two of the whites of 
eggs may be made into a meringue with as many table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. After bakinj; spread the pudding with 
the meringue and brown lightly in the oven. 

Cocoanut Pudding, No. 2.— In a pudding-dish on the 
back of the range. Soake one half cupful of rice m one 
quart new milk two hours. Then add a full half cupful of 
sugar, one fceaspoonful of cinnamon and one cupful of 
cocoanut, and bake in a moderate oven one hour. Stir 
QCQasionally during the first half hour. 



FBUrrS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Cocoanut Puddingr^ No 3.— One quart of milk, four 
tablefcpoonfuls of corn-starcb, one cup of sugar, a salt- 
spoonful of flavoring, four eggs and one cup of grated cocoa- 
nut. Boil the milk with the sugar and salt, dissolve the 
corn-starch in a little cold water, and add. When smooth 
and thick, stir in the eggs beaten well, the cocoanut and 
flavoring, and put in a large mould to cooL Serve with 
whipped cream or boiled custard. 

Cocoanut Pudding, No. 4.— Thicken two oupfuls of 
milk with a scant half -cupful of flour wet with a little cold 
milk and stirred into the boiling milk, and when cooked 
stir in four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two stiff-beaten 
eggs. Boil enough to cook the eggs, stirring aJl the while, 
then add a scant pint of grated cocoanut and one teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla. Pour into a mould and serve with cream. 

Cocoanut Sponge.— Half fill a glass dish with thin 
slices of plain, stale cake. Alternate them with layers of 
grated cocoanut, and pour over all a thin boiled custard 
made with the yolks of four eggs and a pint of milk sweet- 
ened to the taste. Serve cold. 

Cocoanut Custard.— Mix a pint of milk with the milk 
of one cocoanut and half the meat grated, a pinch of salt and 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Beat three eggs leaving out the 
whites of two; into this stir very carefully and slowly the 
boiling milk. Set the saucepan containing the mixture in 
boiling water and let it thicken; then take it out and stir 
till cool. Pour it into cups and cover the whole with the 
whites of the two eggs beaten to a foam, with two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Sprinkle them with grated 
cocoanut, then with powdered sugar, and set them in the 
oven a moment to brown. 

Cocoanut Cookies. (Catharine Owen)— Mix together 
two cupfuls of flour, a teaspoonful of baking-powder and 
a good tablespoonful of lard rubbed into it; stir in one 
cupful of sugar, one cupful of grated cocoanut, and beat 
one eg^ with a cupful of milkj add a few drops of flavoring 



COCOANUT. 65 

and stir all very well together. If the paste is too thick to 
drop from the end of the spoon use a little more milk, drop 
in small cakes and bake quickly. In this way currant 
cookies may be made, substituting currants for cocoanuts, 
caraway seed, chopped hickory nuts, citron, or any spice 
may be used in place of the currants and the cookies called 
by the name of the ingredient. 

Cocoanut Cake, (Good.) —Three-fourths of a pint of 
powdere<i sugar, one large tablespoonful of butter, half a 
pint of grated cocoanut, one pint of flour, one tablespoon- 
ful of baking-powder, and milk enough to make a stiff 
batter. Bake in shallow greased pans and scatter dry 
cocoanut over the top. 

Cocoanut Desiccated. (Catharine Owen.)— This pop- 
ular author says: "I prefer to prepare this myself as it is 
so much whiter and sweeter, and very much cheaper than 
when bought ready prepared. Choose a line cocoanut, 
(as it keeps indefinitely, you may do several,) pare it care- 
fully, wipe it to remove all specks of the rind, or, if very 
much soiled wash it, but dry it very carefully afterwards. 
Then grate it on a large, coarse grater, sprinkle it with 
granulated sugar, shake it up well and then dry on tin 
pans in a cool oven, with the door open, or in the hot sun, 
stirring it up now and then. It should not change color 
at all but be glittering white, and should be perfectly dry 
before it is put away. It keeps for months in tin canisters 
or wide mouthed bottles. 

Cocoanut Potato Pie, N'o. !•— Three eggs, one large 
potato, one-half cup cocoanut, one pint milk, one table- 
spoonful butter, sugar to tfiste, a little salt. 

Boil and mash the potato, and add the sugar, butter,

spoonfuls vanilla or rose water. Boil the milk, take it 
from the fire, and whip in gradually the beaten eggs. 
When nearjy cold, season; add the cocoanut, and pour into 
paste-lined Rie plates. Bake twenty minutes. It will 
make two pies. 

Cocoanut Pie, No. 3. — Save the milk fro.ii a cocoa-, 
nut and grate the meat; mix with the latter the same 
weight of sugar, half a cup of rich milk, or milk and crcj»n),

the palms and bake in a moderate oven. 

Cocoanut l>rops.— Beat to a froth the whites of four 
i^'^g^^f adding gradually one pint of powdered sugar, then 
stir in enough grated cocoanut to make it very thick. 



CEANBEERIES. 67 

Drop on white paper and bake. Desiccated cocoanut 
soaked in milk may be used in place of fresh. 

Cocoanut Con«s. — One pound powdered sugar, one- 
half pound grated cocoanut, whites of five egg». Whip the 
efegs as for icing, adding the sugar until it will stand 
alone, then beat in the cocoanut. Mould the mixture with 
the hands into small cones, and set these far enough apart 
not to touch one another, upon buttered paper in a bak- 
ing-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. 

Cocoanut Cracknels.— Into a pint of fine oatmeal stir 
four tablespoonf uls of fresh grated cocoanut or five of the 
desiccated with three tablespoonf uls of sugar. Stir into it 
halt a cupful or one gill of boiling water and mix thorough- 
ly. Turn it out on a rolling board, well floured, aft^r it has 
stood twenty minutxjs to swell, and roll out a quarter of an 
inch thick. Put a little shred citron and a few currants 
int J each cake, cut out with a bisc ait-cutter, and bake in a 
slow ov^n. Let them stand exposed to the air a few hours 
to make them crispy, and they furnish a delicious cracker. 



THE CRANBERRY. 

This acid fruit, so mu.-.h in request for jellies and sauces, 
is a native of every continent of the North Temperate Zone. 
It grows in marshy places, and its blossoms, of a beautiful 
rose color, give pla(»e to an abundant and piquant flavored 
fruit. The American cranberry is a larger plant and bears 
a larger berry than the foreign. 

CranbeiTies spoil easily, but can bo kept for some time 
in water. They should be cookeJ only in porcelain, gianite 
or stone-ware, and should not be sweetened until they have 
cracked open, unless it is wished to preserve them whole. 

Cranberry Sauce.— Pick over and wash the berries 
and cook with half as much water by measure as there are

THE CUKRANT. 

The currant, a native of the temperate zone of Europe, 
Asia, and America, is one of the most healthful kinds of fruit 
known in the United States. Out of the sixty varieties 
cultivated more than forty are American. 

These include those popularly designated as the white, 
the red, and the black curraD t. The first is a favorite table 
fruit, while the red currant is more generally esteemed for 
the purpose of jelly, jam, and acid flavoring for summer 
beverages. 

Ak a table fruit, strip red and white currants together or 
either sepai'ately, from their stems, dredge thick with pow- 
dered sugar and pour over them either a little sweetened 
water or strained and sweetened cun^ant juice. They may 
also be mashed and generously sugared but should not be 
served uncooked till perfectly ripe. 

The Zante Currant.— This foreign fruit will no doubt 
one day be replaced by the dried Native American fruit, 
which, though less sweet, has more flavor than its distant 
cousin. Used with raisius and citron in cake and puddings 
it is less known as a sauce, either stewed aJone or with rai- 
sins than it should be. It needs little sugar, is wholesome 
and easily prepared. Zante currants need much cleans- 
ing". 

HoiJir to iJFash Currants.— Pour a pound of <5urrants at 
a time into a deep dish, and over them pour a cupful of 
flour. With the hands rub the mixture thoroughly till the 
flour is incorporated with the fruit,. Turn a portion of the 
currants into a colander and flood it with water. The dirt 



CURRANTS. -^l 

will adhere to the flour and be washed away with it Add 
fresh warm water and rub the fruit well between the palms 
and so continue till the water running through is no longer 
discolored. Drain well and pour the currants on a coarse 
clean cloth to dry on tho back of the stove. When dried 
pick out all stems and stones and cover in cans for future 
use. 

Currants,— Select large, ripe bunches of rod or white 
currants or of both, sprinkle with sugar and serve un- 
stemmed. Or, strip from the stems, mash a large cupful, 
squeese through a cloth strainer, sweeten the expressed 
juice, and pour over the remainder of the fruit Serve very 
cold. Again dip in frothed white of egg; while still on the 
stems, roll in powdered sugar and serve. 

Currants Stewed. —Green currants are palatable stewed 
in an equal measure of water; sweeten them just before tak- 
ing from the range. They need a large quantity of 
sugar. 

Ripe Currant Pie.— Mash one cup of ripe currants and 
stir in three-fourths of a cup of sugar filled up with mo- 
lasses. Gradually mix together three tablespoonfuls of 
water with two of flour, stir into the fruit and pour in- 
to a pie- plate lined with paste. Dot the surface with a few 
small crumbs of butter and cross the top with narrow strips 
of past**. Bake in a rather slow oven. 

Green Currant Pie.— Strip currants two-thirds grovn 
from the st<*ms, stew till soft and take from the stove. 
Sweeten to taste, and pour into a pie-dish lined with paste. 
Dredge lightly with flour, and put on a thin upper crust 
Slash the top and bake half an hour. 

Currant Meriugue.-Crush a teacupful of ripe cur- 
rants and sweeten wiih an equal quantity of sugar. Into 
the yolk of two eggs beat a heaping teaspoonf ul of flour 
and «tir into the currants, adding a tablespoonf ul of water if 
they are not very juicy. Line a Jeep pie-plate with crust,

pour in the currants, bake, and then cover the top with 
a meringue made of the well-beaten whites with two table 
spoonsfuls of powdered lugar. Brown sliufhtly in the oven 
and setaway to serve cold. 

Currant Fritters. (Zante Currants).— Two cups dry, fine 
bread-crumlis, two tablespoonfuls prepared flour, two cups 
of milk, one-half pound currants, washed and well dried, 
five eggs whipped very light, and the yolks strained, one- 
half cup powdered sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one- half 
teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil the milk 
and pour over the bread. Mix and put in the butter. Let 
it get cold. Beat in, next, the yolks and sugar, the season- 
ing, flour and stiff whites, finally, the currants dredged 
whitely with flour. The batter should be thick. Drop in 
great spoonfuls into the hot lard and fry. Drain them and 
bend hot to table. 

Currant Pudding.— Beat two eggs light and stir into a 
cupful of sugar creamed with half a cupful of butter, stir 
in a cupful of milk, three-fourthb of a pint of flour with 
two even teaspoonfuls of bakinK-powder and one cupful of 
currants. Bake in patty pans. 

Currant Tartlets.— Line patty-pans with thin pie 
raste and bake. Fill them with currants stewed with one- 
fourth their measure of raspberries and well sweetened. 

Currant Pudding, No 1.— Make precisely like cherry 
batter pudding, pour into a buttered mould and steam an 
hour and a half. Serve with currant juice thickened 
slightly with flour and butter rubbed together and made 
very sweet. 

Currant Pudding, No 2. — Into a common bread pud- 
ding made sweeter than usual and very thick, stir one cup 
of ripe currants and bake at once. Serve with currant 
sauce. 

Currant Pudding, No 3. -Toast stale bread, butter 
lightly and place on the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish. 
Over it pour a la^er of ripe currants sweetened with half

their measure of sugar, then another layer of bread toasted 
and again currants. Pour over half a cup of warm water 
and bake one hour. 

Currant Short-Oake.— Make like strawberry short-cake 
(described under the head of strawberries), and serve with- 
out cream and while warm. 



THE DATE. 

*' There dates of a«:at« and of jasper lay. 
Dropped from the bounty of the pregnant palm." 

No tree occupies so prominent a place in poem and pict- 
ure as the date-palm with its plentiful fruitage of dates. 
It is associated with slow-moving caravans and dusky, tiir- 
baned Arabs, with tlie boundless desert and clusters of 
domes outlined against a cloudless horizon, with the camel 
and all the spices and poesy of the orient. In our prosa- 
ic hemisphere the fruit often becomes a shapeless mass ol 
consolidated sweetness, coarse in taste and appearance. 
Yet the date-palm is known as one of the most highly- 
prized of all trees since its fruit furnishes food to millions 
of our race. 

A native of the north of Africa and the south-west of 
Asia, the date forms the staple article of diet in Persia, 
Arabia, and a portion of Africa. It contains 58 per cent 
of sugar, besides a large amount of gum and other essen- 
tial elements. It is used both when fresh and dried, be- 
sides fumiHhing wine and vinegar after distillation. 

Nor is this the only value of the date-bearing tree. 
Food is procured from the undeveloped panicles of the 
flowers, the roasted seeds are made iato coffee, while from 
them an oil is expressed ; baskets are made from leafstalks, 



n FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

and the leaves furnish mats, bags and material fi)r thatch- 
ing. Buildings are made from the wood of the palm and 
cordage from its fibers, so that no portion of the precious 
growth goes to waste. 

The free use of the date is considered most wholesome. 
In place of citron especially dates may be used to advan- 
tage in many kinds of cookery. They should be pulled 
apart by the fingers and washed in water so thoroughly as 
to remove the dust which may have clung to them while 
drying in their not too cleanly Eastern home, and drained. 
Kemove the stones with the fingers or with a small sharp 
knife. 

Date Sauce.— Prepare apples as for apple sauce, and 
partially cook. Add an equal quanti ty of dates and a 11 1 tie 
sugar and continue stirring until the latter fruit is tender. 
Serve warm or cold. 

Date Pudding-.— Chop fine one cup of suet and beat it 
with one cup ot sugar and the yolks of two eggs till light. 
Thenaddateaspoonfulol cinnamon, the well-beaten whites 
of two eggs, a d lastly one teaspoonful of baking-powder. 
Mix well and stir in one pound of dates stoned and chopped 
fine. Boil or steam three hours in an oiled mould or pail. 
Serve with hard sauce. The dates may be replaced with 
figfs, candied cherries, plums, raisins, or currants. 

I>ate Pie, No 1.— Soak one pound of dates in warm 
water overnight, then stew and sift the same as pumpkin. 
This will make three pies. Into the pulp stir three beaten 
eggs, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, add milk enough to fill 
the plates and sugar to taste. Bake with one crust. 

I>atePie, No 2. - Bake the stoned fruit, either with or 
without apples, between two cmsts. First stir them into a 
pulp with a little warm water. After filling the under 
paste, sweeten them, dredge with flour, cover with the 
second paste, and bake in a quick oven. 



DATES. 75 

Date Puffs.— Cream together one cup of sugar and one- 
fourth as much butter, and into it stir two beaten eggs, 
four tablespoonfuls of sweet milk, flavoring to taste, and one 
large teaspoonful of baking-powder sifted with flour enough 
for a rather thick batter. With this half fill oiled cups, 
then put in a large ta blespoonf ul of stoned dates and over 
these a spoonful of butter. Steam or bake, and serve with 
sweet cream. Oranges, peaches, apricots, figs, or canned 
fruit drained of its juices may be used in place of dtttes. 

Date Mush.— Into a kettle of boiling water stir slowly- 
coarse wheaten fluur, either the crushed wheat or Graham 
flour. It wiJl take about two cups of flour to thicken a lit- 
tle more than two quarts of water. It shouJd be slowly 
sifted through the fingers to prevent lumping. Let it boil, 
with little stirring so asfnot break the granules, over a mod- 
erate fire for ten minutes. Then stir in a pint of fresh dates 
and let the mush cook five or ten minutes more before re- 
moving to the back of the stove. Serve warm or cold. If 
the latter, mould the mush in small bowls. Invert them on 
small soup plates, and eat with cream or fruit juice. This 
makes an excellent dish for breakfast or luncheon. 

The following recipes are from Mrs. Eleanor W. F. 
Bates in Good Housekeepmg, and are original with that 
lady, who deserves the honor of having added several 
wholesome dishes to the repertoire of the fruit-loving 
housekeeper. 

Date Bread. — At night set a sponge of one quart of 
lukewarm water, three pints of common white flour, half a 
teacupful of potato yeast and a teaspoonful of salt. Set it 
in a warm place to rise, and in the morning add one-half 
cupful each of molasses and sugar, and about five cupf uls of 
whole wheat flour. This recipe makes three good-sized 
loaves, and one or two may be reserved for plain bread if 
you wish ; l)ut for each loaf of date bread stir in a pint 
(slightly heaped) of the prepared dates. Rise again and 
bake in an oven not too hot at firstj but increasing in 



76 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

fervor toward the Ifist of the baking. Three-quarters of an 
hour should produce loaves of a rich brown, moist and ten- 
der throughout. Do not cut the loaves for at least twelve 
hours. This bread is a great favorite with children, and in 
point of wholesomeness and deliciousness is almost the ideal 
food. 

Date Cake.— Beat together a slightly heaped cupful of 
sugar and a half cupful of butter, add two well beaten eggs, 
one-half teaspoonful essence of lemon and a scrape of 
nutmeg; add one cupful of sweet milk with one teaspoonful 
of sal eratus dissolved in it; finally add two and one-half 
cupfuls of flour with two teaspoonfuls t'f cream of tartar 
sifted through it. Stir gently into this creamy mass a well 
heaped cupful of prepared dates. Bake in a shallow pan 
and cut in squares. Your family will cordially invite you to 
repeat this cake as often as your time and strength will 
permit. 

I>ate Sandwiches.— Cut white or Graham bread in 
thin slices, trim off any hard crust that may cling round 
the edges, batter thinly, then spread on one slice of prepared 
dates. They will need to be gently coaxed, rolled and 
spread with a silver fork to make a smooth layer. The 
dates having accommodated themselves to circumstances, 
cover with another thin slice of the buttered bread and press 
the two sides gently together, after the well-known manner 
of sandwiches. Serve while they are newly made. Your 
guests will probably consider this dish a distinct novelty. 

Date Pudding.— Almost any recipe that has a layer of 
jam or jelly as part of the rule may be beneficially changed 
by substituting a layer of dates. The following formula 
has been used with success, and is recommended as easy to 
make and gratifying to the taste: Butter a pudding- dish 
and sprinkle on the bottom half a cupful of dry bread 
crumbs wet with a very little milk ; cover with a layer 
of the stoned and washed dates. The next layer should be 
bread-crumbs as before, the same amount, and moistened 
with milk still cautiously. Now heat one quart of milk

and when nearly boiling take it from the fire aii.d add 
gradually the yolks of four eggs which have been pre- 
viously beaten with a half cupful of sugar; add the four 
beaten whites, stirring them in lightly. Return this to the 
fire and stir till it begins to thicken. Take once more from 
i he fire, add the veriest speck of salt and a small half tea- 
i.poonful of v*».nilla. Put the custard, a spoonful at a time, 
upon the layer of crumbs— not to disturb them— and bake 
until handsomely browned on top. Eat lukewarm or coki, 
not hot. 



THE FIG. 

The fig-tree, noteworthy from the fact that it id the first- 
hientioned in the Bible, belongs to a family both numer- 
ous and widely scattered. Among its members are the 
bread-fruit of the Pacific, the upas and the India-rubber 
trees of Java, the banyan of In<lia, and the mulberry and 
Osage orange of the United States. 

Most highly prized of all is the fig-tree, the productionft 
of which form an important article of commerce from the 
Mediterranean. They are dried in the eiun and contain- 
ing so much grape sugar as to need no other preservative. 
This fruit flourishes only where the late sumoier is warm 
and diy, so that the trees are oiian destroyed e veii in Fl'jrida, 
where they form a characteristic portion of tlie landscape. 
On the Pacific coast the fig flourishes unscathed, so that 
the fortuDate planter there can literally sit under his 
own vine and fig-tree, in southern localities, all the live- 
long year. 

The fig-tree was common in Greece during the Platonic 
era, and, following the course of empire westward became 
acclimated in all the warm countries of the world. Its 
yearly consumption is constantly increasing. Great Britain

alone importing the fruit to the value of o"«"er a million of 
doDars annually. In this country the fig has an enor- 
mous sale. 

It would seem that the English forefathers recog- 
nized the value of fruit fully as much as in the 19th cent- 
ury. Of the famous men of the reigns of Edward VI, 
Mary and Elivjabeth, no one ranked higher, an botanist and 
physician, than Wiljiam Bulleyn. There are prose writ- 
ings of the good William which attest his wit and shrewd- 
ness. Among other things he says: " Figges be good 
against melancholy and the falling evil (epilepsy), to be 
eaten. Figges, nuts and herb grace do make a sufficient 
medicine against poison or the pestilence." 

Figs are excellent at breakfast or lunch just as they are 
brought from the Levant. A correspondent of the Die- 
tetic Reformer, a London Monthly, gives this combination 
of 

Figrs and Rliiibarb. (Pie Plant)— Cut the rhubarb intc» 
pieces about two inches long, without peeling, also cut the 
ligs into small pieces, adding sugar and water according to 
taste. Stew in a rather slow oven so as to retain the shape 
of the rhubarb. The following combinations are nice; viz: 
rhubarb stewed with either lemons, raisins, oranges and 
ginger. 

Fig Pudding, No. 2.— Mix toxretherone cap of mola^^ses 
one cup finely chopped suet an even teaspoonful each of 
salt and cinnamon, half a nutmeg, one pound of figs cut in 
fine pieces, and tw j well-beaten eggs. Dissolve an even tea- 
spoonful of soda in a little hot water, stir into a cup of milk, 
and add this to the mixture. Then stir in four cupfuls sifted 
flour, beating thoroughly. Butter a pudding mould or high 
tin pail, pour in the batter, cover closely and set in boiling 
water, which must be kept boiling for three hours. Eat with 
or without sauce made of the yolks of two eggs, stirred into 
creamed butter and sugar, and heated till the egg thickens. 



FIGS. 79 

Flavor with lemon and cinnamon. A cup of sugar may be 
substituted for the molasses, in which case use only three 
cupluls of flour. 

Fig" Pie.— Make a thin rich crust for the bottom. Let it 
come to the edge, and bend it upward just enough to hold 
the filling, but do not make a thick ridge of crust. For a 
medium-sized pie take half a pound of flgs, chop them fine, 
and CO jk with the addition of a cup of cold wetter. When 
the figs are soft and smooth, put in the crust and bake. 
Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff, with 
two tab'.r»3poonfuls o* sugar; flavor with vanilla, and with- 
out taking the pie from the oven, as soon as the crust is 
done, spread this over the top, and let it brown for a min- 
ute or two, not longer. 

Fig and Potato Pudding.— To one half pint of par- 
boiled sweet potatoes pressed through a sieve, one half pint 
of figs chopped fine, thesame measure of fine bread-crumbs, 
a cup of fine seeded raisins, half a cup of butter, the same 
qupntity of sugar, add three eggs, a large cupful of milk and 
d little cinnamon. Soak the bread-crumbs in the butter, 
heat together eggs and sugar into which stir, first the pota- 
to pulp and then the bread-crumbs, flgs, suet and spice. 
Pour into a buttered mould or tin pail, and boil three hours. 
Serve with liquid sauce. 

Fig Pudding.— Chop together one pound of flgs and one 
pound of tine bread-crumbs, add one pound of chopped 
beef suet and one pound of brown sugar, a cup of milk and 
six well-beaten eggs. Boil or steam three hours in a but- 
tered mould, and serve with cream or liquid sauce. Other 
fruits may be used in place of flgs. 

Fig Fancy Cake.— Bake any kind of plain cake in pat- 
ty pans or fancy shapes. Make an icing for them, then 
tak3 one pound of the best figs and cut them in halves, 
and then in narrow strips; arrange them upon the cakes 
while the icing is wet, with the flesh side up. Sprinkle the 
cakes with coarse granulated sugar, and it will give the 
flgs the appearance of being frosted.

THE GOOSEBERRY. 

Ac(H*rding to botaDists the distinction between tlie 
gooseberry and tlie currant is not strongly marked, though 
in appearance they are dissimilar. While North America 
has a number of wild gooseberries the climate of Great 
Britian seems to be more favorable to them than that of 
this country-. The later developed varieties, which are 
destitute of priukles. are easily handled and ai-e most ex- 
cellent. Wlieu unripe they make delicious pies and tarts, 
'and the ripe gooseberry has value in jam and preserves. 

Gooseberry Sauce,— Select large, ripe gooseberries, 
cut off blooms and stems with small scissors, sprinkle with 
sugar and serve with cream. 

Gooseberries Stewed.— Pluck gooseberries before they 
are fully ripe, prepare as above, and stew with a little water 
till soft Season with half as much su^ar as fruit, by meas- 
ure, and serve cold with or without cream. 

Gooseberry Fool.— Cut off the blossoms and stems of 
one quarfc ripe gooseberries and stew them in a large cup of 
water till they are tender. Run them through the colan- 
der to clear them of skins, then stir with the palp a heap- 
ing teaspoon ful of butter, a cup of sugar and the beaten 
yolks of th» ee eggs. Pour -them into the dish in whic'.i 
they are to be served, and cover with a meringue of the 
whites beaten to a foam with as many tablespoonf uls of 
sugar. Serve cold. 

Gooseberry Roll.— Line a very deeppie-plate with paste 
and fill with stewed and mashei gj^vii') rne^ after they are 
seasoned with a teacupful of su;^aiMni:cei with a heaping 
teaspoonful of corn-starch, half a cup of water and a tea- 



GOOSEBERKIES. 81 

spoonful of butter. C'over with a thin upper crust and 
bake. It should be eaten with sweet cream or liquid 
sauce. 

Gooseberry Pie.— Cut off the blossoms and stems and 
fill with them a pie^dish lined with plain paste, spreading 
over the top one-third as much sugar by measure, as of 
berries used. Slightiy dredge with flour and spread over 
a thin crust pricked with a fork. Bake half an hour. 

Gooseberry Custard. (Dr. Holbrook).— Simmer thre<» 
pints of gooseberries over a slow fire till soft, then drain the 
water and rub the berries through a sieve. To a pint of 
pulp add four well-beaten eggs, a cupful of sugar and two 
tablespoonfuis of orange-flower water. Set over the fire 
and stir constantly till it becomes thick. When cold serve 
in custard glasses. Yolks and whites should be l»eaten 
separately. 

Gooseberry Pudding.— Stew a pint of gooseberries 
slowly a quarter of an hour. Butter a pudding-dish and 
prepare several slices of staJe bread toasted a light brown. 
Dip each slice while hot in milk and spread with softened 
butter. Cover the bottom of the pudding-dish with pre- 
pared toast, then with a layer of gooseberries sprinkled 
with sugar. Add another lay or of toast and tben one of 
berries. Cover closely and steam in the oven by setting the 
dish within a largei one containing hot water. It will be 
done in half an hour, and may be eaten with or without a 
pudding-sauce. 

SpicedGooseberries.— CJutoff the blossom end of the 
fruit and to every six pounds allow two quaHs of sugar and 
one and one half cups of vinegar, or two thirds of a pint 
Put the latter over the fire, and when seal J: ng hot pour in 
the berries with oneteaspoonful of whole allspice and cloves 
mixed, a few pieces of stick cinnamon and a trifle of green 
ginger root cut into bits, the whole of these tied in a thin 
muslin bag. Cover closely and let the gooseberries simmer 
till they are tender. Skim the fruit into jars kept in hot 
water, simmer the syrup, pour over and seal. 



«3 FBUITS AND HOW TO USE IHEM. 



THE GRAPE. 

Among the most important and the most luscious of all 
fruits the grape thrives well in the middle and western 
portions of the United States. The foreign varieties, 
which can only be reared in graperies east of the Missis- 
sippi, grow most luxuriantly in California so that the pro- 
ductions of the vine are carried over a large section of the 
country. A fruit so beautiful and delicious ought to be 
raised in such quantities as to appear upon eveiy table 
during two-thirds of the year. 

Grapes are not only noui ishing but are considered to 
have curative qualities. In Germany and Switzerland 
grape-cures are filled with patieuts who consume each 
from three to eight pounds of the fruit per day, generally 
with the best results, to which, no doubt, abstemiousness 
from a rich dietaiy contributes. 

Grapes should be washed and drained before eating. In 
no other way are they so delectable as when fresh from 
the vines. Arranged with or without other fruit, they are 
both lovely and refreshing at breakfast, luncheon or at 
dessert. 

Grape Shopt-Cake. (Mrs. Smithson).— Sift together 
half a pound of flour, a coflFeespoonf ul each of salt and sugar, 
and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Work into this 
mixture a quarter of a pound of cold, well- washed butter; 
add gradually two gills of cold Doiled milk. Mix quickly 
with a knife. Dredge flour over the moulding-board and 
turn the past« upon it. Toss with the knife until it is well 
aou)-ed. Pat it gently with a floured rolUufs^-pin and roU it

down to half an inch in thicltness. Put a plate on top of 
the paste and cut round it. Cut out tv^o round forms and 
bake them on a greased tin. When cool make an incision 
round the center of the edge and divide the short-cake. 

Remove the seeds from a quantity of Malaga grapes with 
a raisin seeding machine. Arrange the grapes on the 
cake. Over the under or center layer of grapes put a layer 
of jelly, and o\rer the top layer of grapes put a covering of 
whipped or velyet cream. 

Orapes Spiced,— Stem and wash wild grapes and boil 
till soft, then press through a coarse sieve. To every ten 
pounds of pulp add half as much sugar, an even tabl*^- 
spoonful of cinnamon, a heaping teaspoonful each of cloves 
spice and pepper, a grated nutmeg and two quarts of 
vinegar. Boil slowly till it is as thick as catsup ought to be, 
then bottle. 

Grape Pie, No !•— One e^g, one teacupful of sugar, one 
heaping teacupful of grapes. Beat the egg and sugar to- 
gether, then add the grapes, one tabiespoonful of flour and 
a little butler. Bake with two crusts. 

Grape Pie, No 2.— Remove the skins from the seeds 
and pulp and simmer the latter in a porcelain kettle and 
press it through a colander to remove the seeds. Then

THE GRAPE FRUIT. 

The grape fruit or shaddock is less well-known than it 
deserves. No more refreshing or wholesome fruit grows, 
though on first tasting it the northerner is apt to pronounce 
it coarse if not unpleasant. To many persons it becomes

a more delicious fniif. than the orange. The abundant, 
acid and slightly bitter flavor serves to quench thirst, and 
it is considered by many to be a sovereign remedy for bil- 
iousness. 

The grape fruit should be peeled in sections, like the 
orange, which are then to be separated from the center 
and the entire bitter white membrane covering them should 
be removed. Then break open the pulp and serve as an 
unseasoned offering to the Lares of the breakfast table, 
preceding the wheat or the oatmeal. 

It is a mistake to adulterate the grape fruit with sugar, 
nevertheless there are those who sprinkle it plentifully 
with sugar overnight. In after years when its cooling 
and pleasant qualities are appreciated, the grape fruit will 
divide honors with its smaller cousin, the orange. 



THE GUAVA. 

This tropical or semi-tropical shrub yields an important 
dessert fruit. It is, however, known to the inhabitants of 
the cooler zones only through guava jftlly, a rich conserve 
imported' from the West Indies. The guava is cultivated 
in Florida, but the manufacture of guava is chiefly con- 
fined to the wanner Indies. 



HUCKLEBERKIES Oil WHOKTLEBEKKIES. 

This pleasant and wholesome fiuit, peculiar to the 
northern latitude, grows both on high and low l)ushes ac- 
cording to its species. On hillsides and mountain clear- 



HUCKLEBEBEIES OR WHORTLEBEREIES. 85 

ings, in old pastures and along purling brooks, the huckle- 
bej-ry profusely ripens. 

It is not a highly flavored fruit but one (^e&ilj esteemed 
amongst a rural popuJation, and one especially wholesome. 
Containing but little acid it needs but little sugar and is 
palatable with milk even without sweetening. When ful- 
ly ripe two tablespoonfuls of sugar to a pint of frnit 
will satisfy the most capricious desire for sweets. They 
need to be carefully picked over, washed and stewed in a 
little water till soft. Huckle berries are especially nice, when 
canued, for pies in winter time or for a breakfast sauce. 
The Huckleberry is the North American representative 
of the Whortleberry and includes the blueberry which is, 
lighter-colored, softer and sweeter than the huckleberry. 

Huckleberry Sauce.— Pick over and wash ripe fruit 
and strew with powered sugar. 

Huckleberries and Milk.— Into a quart bowl crumble 
crackers or a roll and a half; fill with rich new milk or milk 
and cream, "half and half." Pour into the bowl half a 
cupful of huckleberries and stir together the contents. It 
is a nice dish for lunch. 

Huckleberry Griddle-cakes.— Mix together one pint 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder and one pint 
of milk, and stir in one beaten egrg. Pick over a pint of 
fresh berries, wash, roll in flour and add to the batter. 
Pour from a pitcher on a greased griddle. 

Huckleberry Toast.— Pick over, wash, and stew a pint 
of berries, and pour over layers ofth in buttered toast 
They should first be seasoned with sugar, and ought to 
have plenty of j nice. Cover with a plate and let them stand 
a half hour before serving, on the range or in a moderately 
cool oven. When baked in a pudding dish it makes a nic« 
pudding. Finish with a lemon flavored meringue. 



86 FEUITS AND HOW T^USE THfiM. 

Huckleberry Corn Cakes.— Scald a pint of corn meal 
with boiling water, add a heaping tablespoonful of flour 
and milk enough for a rather thick batter. Mix in two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder, two thirds of a cupful of sugar, 
good brown sugar is better than white, and a pint of huck- 
leberries. Bake on a griddle, in muffin rings, or in the 
oven, making them half an inch thick. Chopped apple or 
raspberries may take the place of h uckleberries. They need 
a warm oven. 

Huckleberry Sweet Cake.— One cup butter, two cups 
sugar, three cups of flour, five e^gs, one cup of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water, one teaspoon- 
ful of nutmeg, and the same of cinnamon; one quart ripe, 
fresh huckleb rries, thickly dredged with flour. Stir the 
butter and sugar to a erf am, add the beaten yolks, then the 
milk, the flour, and spice, the whites whipped stiff, and the 
soda. At the last stir in the huckleberries with a wooden 
spoon or paddle, not to bruipe them. Bake in a loaf or card 
in a moderate but steady oven, until a straw comes out clean 
from the thickest part 

Huckleberry or Blueberry Pudding.— Sift together 
a pint and a half of flour and one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking-powder, and into it stir one pint of milk, one well- 
beaten egg, a saltspoonful of salt and three-fourths of a 
quart of berriea Steam for two hours in a buttered mould 
and serve with hard or liquid sauce. 

Huckleberry or Blueberry Cake, No. 1,— Cream to- 
gether one rounded tablespoonful of butter, one half of a 
cupful of sugar, two-thirds of a teacupful of milk, and two 
scant cupfuls of flour, in which have been sifted two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder. At the last stir in a cupful of 
blueberries and bake at once. This cake will hold aheap 
ing cup of fruit. 

Huckleberry Cake, No 2.— Cream together half a cup 
of butter and half a cup of sugar, add four tablespoonfuls 
of Indian meal and one of flour, a scant cup of molasses 
and two-thirds of a cup of milk. Sift in a teaspoonful of

baking-powder, and at the last add two well-beaten es^ga 
and a pint of berries. Bake immediately. 

Huckleberry Pie.— Into a large cupful of berries stir a 
half cup of sugar, a tablespoonf nl of hot water, and a heap- 
ing teaspoonful of flour, made smooth in cold water. Bake 
in a deep pie-Jish with two crusts. 



THE LEMON. 

The celebrated tree of the Citnis genus which furnishes 
this pungent fruit is a native of the forests of Northern 
India, whence it has traveled along the mild shores of the 
Mediterranean. Leaping the Atlantic the lemon has be- 
come acclimated in the southern portion of oui* country 
and in California, though the finest lemons are said by 
dealers in the fruit to come from Sicily. Something m 
that volcanic and sulphurous soil is converted into the 
acid wliich is its chief value. 

The roughness observable on the rind of the lemon is 
owing t*; imbedded cells filled "wdth an oil which is obtained 
either by distillation or expression. The peel is used for 
flavoring, and the abundant acid juice has acquired a world- 
wide value iu the arts, in medicine, in cooling drinks and 
syrups, in flavorings and innumerable dishes and as a con- 
stifcuent of perfumery. Because it is used so little as the 
chief ingredient very few recipes for the lemon are given, 
and these are chiefly under the head of Water-ices, Bever- 
ages, Creams, etc. The value of oranges imported into 
New York alone annually is estimated to be over two mill- 
ions of dollars. 

Lemon Pudding.— All kinds of plain puddings, flavor- 



88 FRUITcJ AND HOW TO (JSE THEM; 

ed with lemon are called lemon puddings, the basis may be 
cornstarch, bread, or custard, and may be baked^ steamed 
or boiled. The following is an excellent bread pudding 
flavored with lemon. 

Liemon Meringue Pudding.— Scald four cups of new 
milk and pour over two cups of fine stale bread-crumbs, and 
let it stand half an hour. Into it stir one cupful of sugar 
and a rounded tablespoonful of butter, the yolks of three 
eggs, and the juice of one large or two small lemons and the 
grated yellow rind of half of one. Beat all together well 
and bake in a buttered pudding-dish till it is just done 
through, not a minute more ; draw the pudding to the edge 
of the oven and cover with the stifif beaten whites, whipped 
with three tablespoonf uls of sugar, and flavored with lemon 
juice. Brown in the oven with the door left open. 

Liemon Fritters.— Beat three eggs light; it id better to 
have yolks and whites separate but they may be beaten to- 
gether. Stir in two cups of new milk, flour enough to 
makf a thin batter, the juice of one lemon, and lastly one- 
fourth of a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little water. 
Pry in hot fat and sprinkle with sugar. When it is done 
cover with a meringue made l>y beating the whitet wuth two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and brown slightly in the oven. 

Liemon Pie. (Miss Hammond. )~-Mix one cup and a half 
of sugar with two heapij ig teaspoonf uls of flour : add the 
well-beaten yolks of six eggs and the whites of two eggs 
beaten stiff, the grated rind of one and the juice of two 
lemons, and one cup of ice water. Line two plates with a 
crust and rim, fill, and bake in a moderate oven. Make a 
meringue with the whites of four eggs and one cup of pow- 
dered sugar. 

Lemon Pie. (Miss Hayes.)— Beat together one cup of sug- 
ar and an egg; when thick and smooth add a tablespoonful 
of flour. Grate a little of the yellow peel from a good sized 
lemon and stir into the mixture. Then peel the lemon, 
carefully removing all the pith, and with a sharp knife cut 
in thin slices, removing all seeds.

Line a pie-plate with crnst, and have the top crust rolled 
ready to use; htlr the lemon sliof s with the e^g and sugar 
and pour into the plate, cover quickly and bake in a quick 
oven. 

Lieinon and Raisin Pie.— Peel one large lemon, cut it 
in thin slices, and turn over it one cup of seeded raisins 
which have been steeped till nearly tender in a little water. 
Steep again till the lemon is tender, add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour, made smooth in a little cold water, one cupful cf 
sugar and boil^ stirring constantly, till it thickens. Bake 
in two cri s s. 

Molasses Lemon Pie, —One cupful sugar, one cupful 
molasses, one cupful water, one and a half tablespoonfuls 
flour, two lemons and one egg. This makes one pie. 

Lemon Cream Pie,— For one large pie, take the juice 
of two medium sized lemons and the grated yellow peel of 
one, a tablespoonful of corn-starch, a teacupf ul of cold wa- 
ter, one of granulated sugar, and three eggs. Heat to the 
boiling-point half the wat^r, the lemon juice, ihe rind and 
the sugar, and pour it over the remainder of the water into 
which the corn- starch has been mixed, stirring all the 
while. Set the whole back on the range and let it come to 
a boil again, then set it away to cool. When cold add the 
yolks of three well-beaten eggs, and bake in a deep pie-plate 
lined with paste. Bake half an hour, then cover the pie 
with a meringue maJe by beating the whites of the eggs to 
a stiff froth with two large tablespoonfuls of powdered sug- 
ar. Two eggs will make a pie good, though less rich. 

Lemon Custard Pie.— Grate the rind of one lemon 
and squeeze the juice on one teacupful of sugar and a ta- 
blespoonful of flc ur, mixed together. Beat to a froth the 
yolks o* three eggs, and stir into them one cupful of new 
milk, then mix in the sugar, flour and juice, and bake in a 
plate lined with paste.

bread-crumbs, Just milk enough to swell tliera, two egg8, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, three of sugar, the juice of 
one lemon and grated rind of two. Beat sugar and butter 
to a cream, then the eggs and lemon juice, and lastly the 
bread and milk. Mix and bake in one crust with two long 
strips about an inch wide laid lightly around the edge so as 
to make it twice as thick as the bottom. Gently press the 
lower edge of this strip to make it adhere and pour in the 
mixture. If a meringue is desired, save out the two whites, 
beat together with pulverized sugar till they are stiff, and 
spread over the pie when done. Return to the oven and 
brown lightly. 

Ijemou Short-cake.— Make a plain biscuit or short-cake 
crust as described in Strawberry short-cake), and spread 
between the two or three layers composing it the yellow 
grated rind and juice of one large lemon mixed with one 
cup of sugar and one cup of fresh sweet cream. Serve at 
once with one cup of cream sweetened and flavored with 
lemon. 

Lienion "Wasliingrton Pie.— Beat the yolks of three 
i gg'i and stir in one cupful of sugar, one cupful of flour, 
and one teaspoonf ul baking-powder and the beaten whites 
of the three eggs. Bake in three or four jelly-cake tins. 
When done spread between them this mixture. 

Boillogether three- fourths of a pint of water, one cupful 
of sugar, and a heaping teaspoonf ul of butter, and stir in 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, made smooth in a little cold 
water. When it thickens draw to the back of the stove 
and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and lastly the juice 
and grated yellow rind of a large lemon. 

Liemou Cake.— Any kind of plain cake flavored with 
lemon passes under this name. The following is good: 

Cream together two cupfuls ofsugarwithtwo-thirdsofa 
cupful of butter, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, then 
the beaten whites, two-thirds of a cupful of milk, three cup-

may be b^atei> Ip^ ja^t he^ore stirring in the lemon juice. 

Lepion Honey, ^o, 1.— (Mrs. Rorer.) Beat the yolks 
of fAx -eggs until light, add gradually, beating all the while, 
oi»o ];M>nnd of powdered sugar. Beat a quarter of a pound 
of butter to a cream, add it to the yolks and sugar, beat 
well, and then stir in carefully the well-beaten white^ of 
four eggs. Pour this into a double boiler and stir contin- 
ually over the fire until the mixture is about the consistency 
of very thick cream; take from the fire, and add the grated 
rind of one and the juice of two lemons, mix, and turn into 
ft stoneware or china bowl to cool. 

There is alFo another recipe for a French honey, flavored 
with lemon, that is not so heavy and indigestible as the 
former. 

French Honey. — Beat together a quarter of a pound of 
powdered sugar, and a quarter of a pound of butter; when 
light add one unbeaten egg, and beat again ; stir this over 
the fire till it thickens, then take from the fire, and add 
the grated rind and the juice of one lemon, mix and turn 
out to cool. 

Lemon Honey, No. 2.— Melt together three ounces of 
fresh butter and one cup of sugar, and stir into them the well- 
beaten yolks of three eggs into which has been mixed the 
grated yellow peel of one large lemon. Stir over the fire 
till it begins to thicken, then add the juice of the lemon, 
and continue stirring till it is as thick as honey. Pour into 
jelly glasses and cover. Use very thin to spread upon lay- 
er cake, or as a flavoring in cooking. 

Lemon juice may often be used to advantage in place of 
vinegar, especially in salads. In regard to the uses c»f the 
lemon the London Lancet says: 

" Few people knew the value^f lemon- juice. Apiece of 
lemon bound upon a corn will cure it in a few days ; it 
should be renewed night and morning. A free use of

lemon-juice and sugar wiH always relieve a cough. Most 
people feel poorly in the spring, but if they would eat a 
lemon before breakfast every day for a week — with or 
without sugar as they like — they would find it better than 
any medicine. Lemon-juice, used according to this rec- 
ipe, will sometimes cure consumption : Put a dozen lem- 
ons into cold water and slowly bring to a boil ; boil slowly 
until the lemons are soft, then squeeze until all the juice 
is extracted ; add sugar to your tasta and drink. In this 
way use one dozen lemons a day. If they cause pain, les- 
sen the quantity and use only five or six a day until you 
are better, and then begin again with a dozen a day. Aft- 
er using five or six dozen the patient will begin to gain 
flesh and enjoy food. Hold on to the lemons, and still 
use them very freely for several weeks more. Another 
use for lemons ia for a refreshing drink in summer, or in 
sickness at any time. Prepare as directed above, and add 
wat'-r and sugar. But in order to have this keep well, 
after boiling the lemons squeeze and strain carefully; then 
to every half pint of juice add one pound of loaf or crush- 
ed sugar, boil and sUr a few minutes more until the sug- 
ar is dissolved, skim carefully and bottle. You will get 
more juice from the lemons by boiling them, and the prep- 
aration keeps better." 

An eminent physician also says of the lemon : 
"It is suitable for all stomach diseases, excellent in 
sickness, ia cases of jaundice, gravel, liver complaints, in- 
fliimmation of the bowels and fevers. It is a specific 
against worms and skin complaints. Lemon juice is the 
best anti-scorbutic remedy known. It not only cures this 
disease, but prevents it. Sailors make daily use of it for 
this purpose. I advise every one to rub their gums with 
lemon juice to keep them in a healthy condition. The 



MANGOES. 93 

bands and nails are also kept clean, white, soft and supple 
by the daily use of lemon instead of soap. It also prevents 
chilblains. Lemon is used in intermittent fevers mixed 
with strong, hot, black coffee, withoat sugar. Neuralgia 
may be cured by rubbing the part affected with a cut lem- 
on. It is valuable also to cure warts, and to destroy dan- 
druff on the head by rubbing the roots of the hair with it." 
It is also excellent to use with a little water and no sug- 
ar in malarial diseases. 



THE LIME. 

In the United States the culture of the lime is product- 
ive of better results than that of the lemon, for which it is 
DO inferior substitute. Like the lemon the lime belongs 
to the Citrus family. The fruit grows npon a small tree 
or shrub and is a native of Asia though now common to all 
warm countries. The juice of the bme is used on ship- 
board as an anti-scorbutic, and from it is manufactured Cit- 
ric Acid. Wherever lemon juice is needed, that of the 
lime can take its place. 



THE MANGO. 

The Mango, a native of the East Indies though naturalized 
in other warm countries, affords aa excellent fruit, which, 
however, is too perishable for transportation to a distance

NUTS FOR FOOD. 

The natural liking for nuts must have its origin in some 
physical 'want. Nothing is more full of nutrition than a 
nnt and if eaten at a proper time, nothing is a better sub^ 
stitute for animal food. Especially in this the case in win. 
ter when oil is desirable in the human economy. Physiol- 
ogists assert that nut3 contain more elejaeuts of nourish- 
ment than butter and meat combined. Furthermore 
they can be neither adulterated nor uncleanly, for Nature 
herself has secreted their richness from various unpolluted 
woodland stores. Salt should always be used with nuts. 

Hickory Nut Cookies.— Beat four eggs very iight, 
whites and yolks separately. Into the yolks stir in two 
scant cupf uls of sugar, and then the beaten whites. Ac d a 
pint of flour, a hea^ ing teaspooncul of baking-powder, ana 
a pint of nuts cut in small pieces and rolled in flour. Mix 
quickly and thoroughly, and drop a small spoonful at a 
time upon gfreased and floured pans. Place half a nut on 
the middle of each cooky and bake in a very moderate oven 
twenty minutes. In pl<ice of hickory nuts use raisins, 
seeded and chopped, cocoanut or currants. These cookies 
will keep along time,— if they are untouched. 

Hickory Nut Macaroons.— Beat to a stiff froth the 
whites of three eggs and beat in a little at a time, a pint of 
powdered sugar, a tablespoonf ul of flour and a teaspoon- 
ful of corn-htarch. Into this stir a pint of finely chopped 
nuts and drop in small spoonfuls upon buttered pans. 
Bake in a moderate oven. 

Nut Cake, No 1,- Cream two cups sugar and one of but

lastly two cups of any kind of nut kernels and one of stoned 
and chopped raisins. 

Nut Cake, No 2.— Cream three-fourths of a pint of sugar 
and half a cup of butter, add three-fourths of a cup of milk, 
the beaten whites of four eggs, and two cupfuls of flour sift- 
ed with two teaspoonf ujs of baking-powder. Stir in one cup 
of walnut meats and a little salt. The nuts should be broken 
in small pieces and floured. Ice the cake and decorate the 
top in fanciful figures made with walnut halves laid in the 
icing before it has hardened. 



THE CHANGE. 

•* Orangres that glow 
Like grlobes of fire, inclose a heart of snow 
Which thaw not in their flame,—" 

This delicious fruitage of one variety of the genus Cit- 
rus is justly efeteemed all over the world. Associated 
with all the splendor and coloring of the tropics it holds in 
its golden globes a wealth of attractiveness beginning wdth 
the colorless buds and blossoms which adorn the bride of 
every country and race. Its juicy and delicious fruitage, 
appearing simultaneously with its piire whits blossoms and 
its fragrant evergreen foliage are the delight of every trav- 
eler in the southern clime. 

Botanists are undecided whether the orange is a native 
of India or of China. Very likely it is indigenous to both 
countries. It does not matter since all warm regions now 
claim it &s their own. 

Its cultivation is greatly on the increase in our own 
country, so that Florida and CaHfomia are now sending to 
the markets of the B^^st pome of the finest oranges ever

grown. It is exceedingly prodactive, one tree sometimes 
yielding 20,000 annually. 

There are various kinds of oranges, the names of which it 
is unnecessary to specify. The bast oranges are the heav- 
iest, for light oranges have thick skins and these weigh 
tittle. The richest are the russet skinned. 

There are about as many ways of eating oranges as 
iheie are varieties. Perhaps the simplest is to cut a slice 
^rom the top and eat pulp and juice with the spoon ; but 
this requires a juicy fruit. The Havana method is as 
good as any. In this a fork is run from the stem end 
quite to the center. By holding the fork in the left hand 
fche right is left free to cut away the peel and white skin 
leaving only the pulp. The Cubans then transfer the or- 
ange to the right hand and eat it at leisure. A favorite 
way with the Floridians is to cut the orange ^in two at 
:,nght angles to the stem and using each hemisphere as a 
<?up, eat the juice with a spoon. Others are only satisfied 
by peeling the fruit and separating the sections. 

Orangre or Liemon Pates.— "With the grated rind and 
pulp of two oranges op lemons mix the beaten yolks of six 
eggs, and one tablespoonf ul of sugar to each, two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter and two of water. With this mixture 
fill patty-pans lined with paste and add a raised rim of 
paste about the edges. Bake, and when done cover with a 
meringue of the whites of eggs and six tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, set back in the oven and broWn lightly. 

Orange Tapioca.— Wash and steep a cupful of tapioca, 
then simmer in a pint of boiling water until the tapioca is 
clear. Peel and seed on« dozen sour oranges, cut them in 
slices; and stir into the boiling tapioca. Sweeten to taste. 
Cook, and serve with cream and sugar. 

OFvtige Compote,— Boil together half a teaxsupful of 



0BA:7C E3. 97 

water and a pint of sugar; skim the syrup, and add the juice 
of one lemon. Peel a dozen juicy oranges and cut them 
across in the middle taking out the seeds, and drop them in 
the hot syrup, three or four at a time. Let them scald, 
skim out the sections and place in a flat dish; boil down the 
syrup five minutes, pour over them and set away to cool. 
This ^ akes a nice garnish and sauce for plain puddings, es- 
pecially when oranges are tart or hardly sweet enough to 
eat uncooked. 

Orangre Tarts.— Beat together three fourths of a cup of 
sugar and one tablespoonful of butter, the juice of two or- 
anges and grated peel of one, and into them stir one tea- 
spoonful of corn-starch wet with the juice of half a lemon. 
Beat thoroughly, and bake in patty-pans lined with paste. 

Orange Rolly-Poly.— (Marion Harland.) Make a light 
paste as for dumplings, roll in an oblong sheet, and lay or* 
anges peeled, sliced, and seeded thickly all over it. Sprink- 
le with white sugar. Scatter a teaspDonful or two of the 
grated yellow peel overall, and roll up closely, folding down 
the end to secure the syrup. Boil in a pudding-cloth one 
hour and a half. 

Orange Cake.— (Mrs. Scovil.) Take two cups of sugar, 
two cups of flour, half a cup of water, the yolks of five and 
the whites of three eggs, the juice and grated rind of one 
orange, and a small pinch of salt. Beat the whites to a 
stiff froth ; add the sugar, then the yolks, previously well 
beaten, then the flour, and lastly the orange. Bake in three 
tins. The cup used for measuring must be a small one. 
When taken from the oven, spread between and on top of 
the cakes a frosting made with the whites of two e^s, 
the grated peel and juice of one orange, and enough of sug- 
ar to make it the consistency of ordinary frosting.

slices and then cut each slice into quarters. Line a Wash- 
ington pie-plate with light paste and bake in a quick oven 
until done. Stir the orange slices quickly into the custard 
mixture, fill the baked crust with ihis, and place in a quick 
oven a fe v minutes to brown. While it is browning, beat 
the whites of two eggs until light, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar and beat until stiff. Spread this over 
the pie, dust thickly with powdered sugar, and stand again 
in the oven until lightly colored. 

Orange Pie, No. 3.— Beat to a cream a teacupful of 
powdered sugar and one tablespoonf ul of butter; add the 
beaten yolks of three eggs, then the juice and grated rind 
of two oranges. Beat all together. Lastly stir in lightly 
the whites beaten to a froth. Bake with an under crust

beaten egg, one half a cup of milk and one pint of flour 
into which has been sifted two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder. Bake in two sheets. Have six oranges peeled 
and seeds removed, sprinkle with sugar and place between 
layers. For sauce, use grated rind of two oranges, and 
juice of one, one half cup sugar, one teaspoonful of butter 
and two cups water; thicken with corn starch. Serve hot 

Orange Baskets.— Cut as many oranges as will be re- 
quired, leaving half the peel whole for the baskets, and a 
strip half an inch wide for the handle. Remove the pulp 
and juice, and use the juice in making orange jelly. Place 
the baskets in a pan of broken ice to keep upright. Fill 
with orange jelly. When ready to serve, put a spoonful 
of whipped cream over the jelly in each basket. Serve in 
8, bed of orange or laurel leaves. 

Orange Sauce.— Make a clear syrup of half a pint of 
sugar to a pint of water. Let it boil and clarify, or skim il. 
While it is heating peel oranges that are not quit« ripe 
enough to eat uncooked, and take off all the wh'te skin 
that can be removed without breaking the fruit Separate 
the oranges into sections and drop into the boiling syrup 
and cook till they are thoroughly scalded. The juice of a 
lemon and a little grated peel may be added if that flavor 
is desired. If the oranges are not to be served at once, 
strain oflf the syrup, scald, and pour over the orange sec- 
tions again.

THE PEACH. 

" Like balls of srold 
The peaches seemed, that had in fire been rolled." 

The peach season, short though it is, is full of delight 
for the lovers of this rich fruit. Like the apple it belongs 
to the order llosacea but unlike that fruit it is very per- 
ishable. There are many sub-varieties of the two princi- 
pal varieties, Freestones and Cvlingstones, which are used to 
a great extent, not only when fresh, but when dried, evapo- 
rated or in cans. 

The Nectarine, which is vnthont dcjubt derived from the 
peach, is covered with a smooth skin. It is more delicate 
than the parent fruit and, if anything, more delicious. 
The Nectarine may be used in the place of the' peach in 
all recipes wherever the latter 19 msationed. So may the 
Apricot. 

Peaches are best eaten peeled, sliced and slightly sugared. 
Sweet cream is a wonderful addition . 

Baked Peaches, No. 1-— Wipe the peaches so as to take 
away the surface and pack them in a small stone jar. Pill 
about two-thirds full and nearly cover the fruit with water. 
Scatter sugar over them and bake In a slow oven, from one 
to three hours, according to the condition of the fruit 

Baked Peaches, No. 2,— Rub clingstones with a flannel 
cloth to remove the down, and arrange them in a stone iar 
which must not be quite filled. Pour over them enough 
water to one-third fill the jar and bake in a slow oven two 
hours. Before they are done pour over them one cup of 
gugar dissolved in a little boiling water. 



PEACHES. 103 

Peach Flummery.— Line the bottom of a glass or porce- 
lain dish with slices of st-.le cake, not more than an inch 
and a half thick. Make a boiled custard out of a pint of 
milk and the yolks of four e^gB, and j ast before serving 
pour it over the cake. On this spread a thick layer of peeled, 
sliced and sugared peaches, and over that a meringue made 
of the whites of four eggs beaten stiff with four tables poon- 
f uls of sugar. 

Peach and Apple.— When peaches are scarce they may 
be used to flavor twice their quantity of apples. The latter 
frnit should be mellow and delicately flavored. Peaches 
and apples ought to be sliced thinly, piled in layers with 
powdered sugar and served at- once with or without 
whipped cream.. 

Peach Custard.— Press a few Ptewed or canned peaches 
through a sieve, using from five to eight, according to size, 
and add a pint of new rich milk. Stir thij3 into three well- 
beaten eggs, whites and yolks together, with half a cupful 
of sugar, and bake in a deep pie-plate lined with paste. 

Peach Manioca Pudding^.— Stir iuto two cupf uls of 
milk four tablespoonfuls of manioca and let this come to a 
boil. Then mix in two beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, two more cupf uls of milk and a trifle of lemon peel 
or fresh grated rind. Peel and slice a dozen peaches, 
sprinkle with sugar and pour over the manioca, the whole 
to be baked in a buttered pudding-dish. 

Peach Bread Puddingy. —Pour boiling water on a 
pint of fine stale bread or cracker-crumbs and stir in a 
tablespoonful of melted butter. Let it stand till it has 
thoroughly s leaked. Into it stir two well-beaten eggs and 
half a cupful of sugar. On the bottom of an oiled pudding- 
dish put a thin layer of batter and over it a layer of sliced 
peaches. Dredge with sugar, then cover with batter again. 
Continue until the dish is full having batter at the top. Kat 
with sweetened cream. It is a good way to cook sour or 
late hard peaches. 



IM PBUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Peach Pudding Boiled. — Make a thick batter of one 
cup of flour into which is sifted a teaspoon ful of baking- 
powder, three-quarters of a cup of milk and two well-beat- 
en eggs. Stir in as many peeled and sliced peaches as it 
will fairly hold, turn inio a buttered dish, which must not 
be quite filled, pluftge into boiling jvater, which must not 
cease boiling for an hour or it will be heavy. Serve with 
hard or liquid sauce. 

Peach Batter Puddingy- —(Helen Campbell.) One can 
of peaches drained of their juice, three eggs well beatea, 
one tablespoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, two 
cups of prepared flour. Butter a pudding-dish holding 
nearh two quarts and put in the drained peaches. Sift 
salt and flour together, rub in the butter till perfectly fine, 
beat the eggs and add to the milk, stirring it slowly into the 
flour. Beat to a smooth batter, pour over the peaches and 
bake fn a quick oven. It will require about half an hour 
and should be served at once. 

Sauce for Peach Puddingr— Bring the juice poured 
from the can of peaches to the boiling point Dissolve a 
tablespoonful of corn-starch in half a teacupf ul of cold 
water, add to the juice and boil two minutes. Then add a 
small teacupf ul of sugar, and the grated rind and juice of a 
lemon. 

Peach Puddingy Baked,— (Mrs. Goodal©.) Pare and 
halve a quart of fine, ripe peaches and stew them gently 
with sugar to taste. While still hot place in a pudding 
dish and pour this batter over them. To one quart of milk 
take six eggs and six tablespoonf uls of flour, beat the yolks 
and whites separately, stir the flour to a paste with half a 
cup of the cold milk, put the remainder over to boil and 
add the yolks to the flour. When the milk boils stir it into 
the mixture and keep stirring till it thickens, then add the 
whites, quickly beating the whole and pouring it over the 
peaches. Bake half an hour. This is an excellent batter 
for cherries or other fruit. Eat with a sauce of thin 
custard. 



PEA.CHE . 105 

Peach Pudding.— (Mrs. Rorer.) Rub batter the size of 
an egg into a pint of flour, add half a teaspoontul of salt 
and a large teaspoonf ul of baking-powder. Pare six large 
peaches, take out the stones after cutting them in halves. 
Beat one egg till light, add it to the milk and pour this 
over the flour; give a thorough beating and pour into a 
greased baking-pan. Have the batter about one inch 
thick. Put the peaches over this, the stone sMe up, fill the 
hollow places with sugar and bake in a quick oven thirty 
minutes. Serve hot with cream and sugar. Apples may 
be used instead of peaches. Peaches should be pared, cut 
in halves and stoned. 

Peach and Tapioca Pudding. —Soak in a quart of 
water overnight one large cupful of tapioca and in the 
morniag cook tiil iWs soft, then add a pinch of salt, six 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar and the juice of one quart 
of nice peaches stewed soft but not broken. In a battered 
pudding-dish pour a layer of tapioca then lay in the peach- 
es and over them pour the remainder of the tapioca. Bake 
an hour a^ eat with sweet cream. 

Peach Dumpling.— Line half a dozen well-oiled! cups 
with paste and fill them with finely-sliced peaches sweet- 
ened to taste, cover with more paste, then set them in a 
pan half filled with boiling water and bake or stearu forty 
minutes. Turn out on a dish and serve with liquid sauce. 

Peach Fritters. —Beat two eggs with four tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, add a small cupful of milk and a lar^e capful 
ot fiour, enough for a thick batter, with a teasp jonf ul of 
baking powder. Into the batter stir a large half pint of 
peaches cut fine, and fry in hot fat. 

Peach Cobbler.— Pill a shallow pudding-dish or deep 
earthen pie-plate with ripe peeled peaches, leaving in the 
pits to increase the flavor of the fruit. Add cold water 
enough to half fill the dish and cover the whole with a light 
paste rolled to twice the thickness used for pies. Cut slits 
across the middle prick with a fork and bake in a slow ov- 



106 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

en about three-fourths of an hour. The peaches should be 
sugared according to the taste before putting on the crust. 
Served either warm or cold, the crust should be inverted, 
after being cut into sections, and the peaches piled upon it. 
Eat with sweet cream. 

Dried Peach Pie.— Soak dried apricots or peaches over 
night, after first washing them thoroughly, then cook very 
slowly on the back of the stove fully two hours. Add suga:' 
to ta<»te justos it is taken from the stove. Arrange the 
pieces and juice, of which there should be but little, on a 
deep pie-plate lined with paste, and ei iher cover with a thin 
paste or cross the top with narrow twisted strips, diamond - 
wise. If the fruit is much broken in pieces sift it, and aft- 
er baking cover the top with a meringue made with the 
white ol one egg and one tahlespoonf ul of sugar, and brown 
in a mod irate oven. Evaporated peaches are now so del- 
icately prepared that in winter they maKe a substitute for 
the fresh fruit. 

Peach Meringue.— To every pint of stewei^nd canned 
peaches, sweetened to taste, stir in the beaten yolks of two 
eggs. Bake in a deep pudding dish fifteen minutes, then 
cover with the whites of the two eggs, beaten till very light 
with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Brown in the oven and 
serve cold with whipped cream. For peaches substitute 
any other stewed fruit at hand if need be. 

Peach Butter.-— Peel and pit very ripe peaches and 
cook till they become a thick marmalade. Then add a very 
little sugar and let it set on the back of stone till the fruit 
is quite solid. Pack in stone jars while hot and keep cool.

THE PEAR. 

The long-^ >y<l pear tree bears a fruit "which is every 
year becoipiljg more common and justly prized. In 
Southern Europe and Asia, the pear grows wild as a large 
shrub, but ciJtivation has ameliorated and sweetened the 
character of the fruit so that it is counted one of the best of 
the temperate zone. Over a thousand varieties have been pro- 
duced„ only a comparatively few of which, however, are known 
to the housekeeper. Summer pears are worthless when al- 
lowed to ripen on the tree. Plucked when mature and kept 
covered with flannel in t^ dark chamber, the pear becomes 
mellow and rich. It is fine as a table fruit, making with 
the peach, the plum and the grape, a breakfast or dessert 
dish fit for any occasion, satisfying as these combinations 
are to the esthetic sense and the palate. 

Pears and Cream.— Take ripe mellow pears, peel and 
slice them and sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar. Jast 
before sending to the table pour over the layers whipped 
cream and serve at once. 

Pears Stewed.— Select small pears free from knots and 
worms, wash them and arrange in a deep kettle and pour 
over them enough boiling water to come within two inches 
of the topmost. Cover and simmer slowly on the back of 
the range. When they begin to be tender, when pricked 
with a fork, pour over them half a cup of molasses and half 
a cup of brown sugar for every gallon of fruit. Stew till 
they are soft but not broken, take them out and pour over 
them the syrup. Larger pears may be peeled before stew^ 
ing. 



108 FBUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Pears Baked.— Take larger pears tht n are used in stew- 
ing, selecting those of nearly uniform size. Arrange thfmi 
in a deep baking-dish, into which pour half a pint of hot 
water, in which has been stirred half a cupful of sugar. 
Cover with a lid or inverted dish and bake slowly, fre- 
quently basting them with the syrup till they are tender. 
They are excellent with a dressing of cream. 

Pear Tarts.— Cover patty-pans with pie-paste and fill 
each with three-quarters of pears, peeled, cored and stewed 
in a rich sugar syrup till tender. Preserve the syrup for 
pudding sauce. 

Prickly Pears.— This fruit of the cactus is often 
brought from Mexico where it is freely eaten. It is thickly 
covered with spines and must be handled carefully, even 
when the hand is protected v/ith a napkin. Cut a slice off 
the ends, then peel it, cut the pup into slices which may be 
eaten unseasoned or after dusting with powdered sugar 
and flavoring with the juice of an orange. 

Pear Klosse.— (A (xerman Dish.) Pare, core and 
mince finely half a dozen ripe pears. Mix with them half a 
grated nutmeg, two ounces of clarified butter sugai-, to taste, 
four well-beaten eggs and as much finely grate 1 bread to 
make the mixture stiff and smooth. Mould into egg-shape 
balls with the bowl of a large spoon, drop the e in boiling 
water and simmer half an hour. Serve on a hot dish with 
powdered sugar and a trifle of cinnamon. Send milk 
sauce to the table with them. 



PLUMS*, 109 



THE PERSIMMON. 

The Persimmon tree of the Atlantic and Southern States 
belongs to the ebony family, one member of which bears 
the date plum. Its fruit is extremely astringent until aft- 
er hard frosts and just l>efore decay, when it is eagerly 
sought by those who relish its sweetly insipid taste. The 
Japanese persimmon has for the last two years been nat- 
uralized in Florida, and its fruit, greatly similar to a smooth 
orange-colored plum tomato, is now marketed in northern 
cities. It is eaten raw like the native persimmon. 



THE PLUM. 

Some of the most delicious fruit is found upon the plum- 
tree, though unfortunately it suffers greatly from the attacks 
of the curculio. Prof. Gray declares that " the difference 
between the cherry and the plum is hard to define," but in 
ordinary experience the later and richer fruit is more 
justly esteemed. But for the insects which prey upon it 
and the diseases to which it is subject, the plum would be- 
come an important fruit food. 

Prunes are the dried fruit of ceitiin kinds of plums, the 
finest of which are called Prunelles. Prunes are exported 
from Turkey, Spain and Germany, but the best foreign 
fi'uit comes from Fiaice. Calif o'^nia now bids fair not 
only to equal but exceed all imported fruit. "Year by year 
since the process of raising and curing plums approhesi, 



110 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

perfection, the California prune is showing its superiority 
in point of appearance and flavor. It is much better 
cured by the process of evaporation than by the French 
method of drying, in which a portion of the flavor is lost. 

Plum Pie,— Stew any kind of plums and sweeten the 
fruit just before it is taken from the stove. Remove the 
pits and pour the pulp into a paste lined pie-plate. Dredge 
with flour, cut an aperture in fJie top crust and bake. 
Dredge with powdered sugar and serve cold. 

Dried Plum Pies.— Soak dried plums overnipfbt, 
stew them gently, and sweeten to taste. Ck>ver a deep pie- 
dish or shallow pudding-di&h with paste, over which spread 
a thin layer of the plums, then a thin layer of paste. Add 
another layer of plums, cover with paste a second time and 
bake. 

Pium Boil. —Stew the plums till they are soft, remove 
skill and pits, and run them through a tjoarse sieve. Make 
a batter of one cupful of milk and a half cupful of butter, 
thickened with flour enough to make a soft paste, and one 
teaspoonful of baking-p jwder. Bake in three layers, be- 
tween which spread plum sauce. Serve warm or cold. 

BiPlum Dumplings.— Sift three cupfuls of flour with 
two teaspoonfuls ot baking-powder, and cat into it a heap- 
ing teaspoonful of butter, wet with water enough for a soft 
dough, and stir in a cupful of plums, either stewed or 
canned. Steam in cups set in a pan of hot water in the ov- 
en about half an hour. Invert the dumplings on dessert 
plates and serve with liquid sauce. 

Plum Pudding.— Stew a quart of plums, remove the 
pits and pour them, after sweetening, into an earthen pud- 
ding dish. Over them lay a soft biscuit dough or with a 
batter made '^ a cupful of sweet cream or rich milk, one egg, 
and a teaspoonful of baking-powder in flour enough for a 
thick batter. Steam one hour or bake half an hour. In- 
vert the pudding and eat with ha-d sauce. 



PINE-APPLES. Ill 



THE PINE-APPLE. 

The pine-apple, wbicb comes to such perfection when 
properljr cultivated, in tropical America, the Bahamas and 
South Flori<la, is, without doubt, desfcmed to have a greater 
popularity than it has yet received. When neglected ttie 
fruit is coaise and tough, and it will l:e the duty of South- 
em California to biing thepineapple to a high degree of 
perfection. It is a perishable fruit ; fully one-thir<l of that 
which is imported is wasted, but it is t^30 good to remain 
undeveloped in hardy qualities. 

The pine-apple grows upon a shrub having along narrov^r 
leaf, the whole rising fi'om two to three feet above the soil. 
As it ripens the fruit is curiously and beautifully shaded, 
and is protected by leaf spines or daggers, several of which 
grow from each plant. About 200,000 pine-apples are 
annually shipped from Nassau alone. 

The natives of Manila manufacture from the leaves of 
the pine- apple a beautiful and expensive fabric termed 
Pina muslin. Perhaps the value of the fiber may conduce 
to the culture of the fruit. 

Pine-apple Sauce.— Bofl together a cupful of sugarand 
three-fourthsjof a cupful of water and thicken with a dessert- 
spoonful of arrowroot, made smooth in a little cold water. 
Take from the fire, and when cooled a little stir in a cupful 
of grated pine-apple, the juice of one lemon and two oran- 
ges. Use as a pudding sauce. 

Pine-apple an.l Potato Pudding.— Press through a 
coarse sieve tuough parboiled sweet potatoes to make j.

pint of pulp, which must be added to a h'ttle less than a 
half-pint of sugar creamed with an even tablespoonf ul of 
butter and the well-beaten yolks of three eggs. Mix in the 
potato slowly, beating all the while to keep the mixture 
light, then stir in one large cupful of new milk, another of 
grated pine-apple, half a teaispoonf ul of vanilla flavoring 
and lastly the well. beaten whites of three eg^%. Bake in a 
pudding-dish in a moderate oven. Serve with cream or 
pine-apple sauce. By the same recipe make a banana pud- 
ding taking a cupful of chopped bananas in place of pine- 
apple. 

Pine-apple Pudding, No. 1.— Chop;flne one can of pine- 
apple or as much fresh fruit as will equal a canful in meas- 
ure. Mix tog ?ther one half-cupful of fine cracker or biead 
crumbs, one ana one half cupfuls of granulated sugar, a heap- 
ing tablespoonf ul of butter, and four yolks of f ggs, the lat- 
ter well beaten. Into this latter stir the pine-ax3ple, and 
bake. Cover the top with the meringue made with the 
whites and three tablespoonf uls powdered sugar, and brown 
in the oven. Serve warm or cold with liquid sauce. 

Pine-apple Pudding, No. 2.— (The Cook.) Cover the 
bottom of a pudding-dish with light puff -paste and place 
on it a thin layer of shredded pine-apple. Strew over if a 
tablespoonful of sugar, then another layer of pine-apple. 
Cover with a crust with a hole out in the center, and bake 
half an hour. 



THE POMEGRANATE. 

Only a denizen of a warm climate fully appreciates the 
pomegranate, which has lately become a familiar sight in 
Northern markets. Whoever once learns to like the pome- 
granate ever afterwards highly esteems its slightly acid 
flavor. At ail times the pomegranate is an ornamental 



PRUNES. 113 

shrub, whether covered with rich crimson flowers or with 
fi-uit. It growH in all warm countries, especially in the 
southern portion of the United States. It is used un- 
co* )ked, most varieties showing an innumerable quantity of 
small seiBds when broken open. 

*• From splintered cups the ripe pomegrianate spiUed 
A shower of rubies." 

Though indigenous to the Old World the pomegranate 
is now popular t'arpugh all the Southern States. The rich 
deepciimsoti of its lovely blossoms and fruit makes it a con- 
spicuous object when planted either singly or in groups. 
When fully ripe^the pomegranate is used uncooked or 
made into a preserve. 



THE PKUNE. 

The prune is the dried fruit of a certain kind of plum, the 
finer sorts of which aie called prunelles. France has here- 
tofore produced the finest varieties but Turkey, Spain and 
Germany also export the fruit. Now, however, California 
is a competitor for the favor of the housekeeper. 

A^a mildly laxative fruit requiring but little sweetening 
the prune bids fair to become a universal favorite. 

The fruit is sometimes dried by artificial heat, but in 
our favored western climate the sun is all sufl&cient. As 
the plum averages ten tons to the acre when the trees 
have attained their full growth, which they do the seventh 
year after setting out, it is expected that large orchards of 
them will soon come into bearing. 



114 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Prunes Stewed.— Wash the prunes and soak them 
three hours in a little water. Put them in a saucepan 
with enough water to cover them, the same in which they 
have been soaked, and to every pound of prunes allow a 
small cupful of sugar, three cloves and a stick of cinnamon 
or the peel of half a lemon. Simmer, not boil, till the 
fruit is quite soft. 

Prune Pudding, No. !•— Soak a pound of prunes 
overnight, sweetening them to taste, aad stew in the morn- 
ing. Remove the pits and cut the prunes into small pieces. 
Beat the whites of eight eggs to a froth and gradually stir 
them in CO the cold prunes, bea^ting all the while. Bake at 
once, about twenty-five minutes. When the pudding is 
cold it is greatly improved by a dressing *of sweet cream, 
sweetened and beaten to a froth. Stir up the prunes once 
while bakine:. 

Prune Pudding, No. 2.— (Mrs. A. A. Lincoln.) Make 
a small mould of lemon jelly. B >il large selected prunes 
slowly until very tender, taking care to keep the skins un- 
broken. Drain and place In a glass dish. Brc^k up the 
jelly all about so that it will have the appearance of being 
made together. Pile whipped cream (made as for Char- 
lotte Russe, one pint of cream and half a cupful of sugar 
flavored with one teaspoonful of vanilla whipped together) 
over the* prunes and jelly. 

Prune Custard.— (Mrs. F. Harkins.) Slowly stew the 
fruit an hour and a quarter in a porcelain-lined kettle. 
Remove the seeds and skins by hand, and rub the pulp 
through a colander or strainer. Hive suffiviient juice to 
make thn pulp quite thin. Return it to the stove and heat al- 
most to boiling. For each pint of fruit stir m two well- beaten 
eggs; remove immediately and stir in lemon flavoring or 
any tart extract desired. Set away in a mould and serve 
with cream. 

Prune Pie, No. 1.— Prepare the prune as for custard, 
and to each cupful of fruit add a cupful of thin cream or 



QUINCES. 1115 

rich milk, the yolks of two eggs, well-beaten, and four 
tablespoonfals of sugar. Whip the whites separately, 
flavor with pine-apple and cut into it the prune just before 
it is put in the oveu. Line a pie-dish with thin paste, pour 
in the prune, and bake quickly. Over the top spread the 
white of an egg, beaten with a tablespoonf ul of sugar and 
also flavored with pine-apple. Return to the oven to 
brown. 

Prune Pie, No. 2.— Stew the prunes, remove the 
stones, stir in two tablespoonf uls of sugar and the same 
quantity of currant jelly or sour apple sauce, or a dessert- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Dust flour over the fruit and bake 
with an upper crust. 



THE QUINCE. 

This fragrant fruit, so highly valued for marmalades and 
jellies, is the product of a shrub which made its way west- 
ward, with so many other modern necessities, from the 
Levant. The quince shrub, — ^it never attains any consider- 
able size, — -belongs to the order Eosacae, like its cousins the 
apple, plum, peach arid pear. It is hardy, easily cul- 
tivated and the fruit is used for many purposes, even the 
mucilaginous seeds l^eing employed in the pharmacy and 
for the arts of the toilet. The aroma and flavor of the 
quince are much prized in cooking, especially in making 
desserts. Recix)es for the use of this fruit will be found 
under the bead of Jellies, Marmalades, Preserves, etc. 

Quince Pie.— Peel, core and stew quinces till so't, then 
press through a colander. Sweeten to taste and bake in 
one crust. Cover the top with a meringue made by the 
beaten whites of two eggs and two tablespoonf uls of sugar* 
Brown sligl Hy in the oven. This is just as good if the fruit 
is half apple and half quince.

THE RAISIN. 

That dried fruit of sweet grapes known as tbe raisin is 
an important minor adjunct of the cuisine. Formerly 
raisins were brought only from Sicily, Turkey, Calabria 
and Spain, buttherapid development of the raisin industry 
on the Pacific coast is a matter of surprise to all interested 
in the culture of fruit. Tlie domestic raisin, it is now ad- 
mitted, is cheaper than the foreign, while also in every way 
fresher and better. 

The white Muscat grape of Alexandria is the principal 
variety used in California. The slips are set out in a 
sandy soil and the vines, though staked at first, are trained 
so as to dispense with support and protect the fruit from 
the direct rayii of the sun. The stem grows no more than 
a yard in height, and imdemeath the lateral branches hang 
heavy bunches of green translucent fruit. 

The first crop matures about the middle of August, the 
second ripens a mcmth later. Three years after planting 
the vines begin to bear, but it takes three years in addition 
to bring them to fidl maturity. As the grapes ripen 
Chinei-e laborers cut off the branches and lay them in 
wooden trays measuring five feet square and three inches 
deep. These are exposed to the sun in which the fruit 
begins almost immediately to ferment. At the end of 
from ten to fourteen days the upper half of the grapes 
having changed to a deep purple under the chemical rays 



RAISINS. 117 

of the sun, empty trays are laid upon those that are filled 
and theu' contents inverted to expose the uncured sides 
to heat and light. In another weak or so they are put into 
"sweat boxes*' to equalize the moisture, and removed to 
the "cooling house," where they are kept two weeks long- 
er. After the clusters are sortsd from the loose grapes 
the raisins are fu)ly packed in "London Layer ' style, 
making as choice a table fruit as can be found in any 
market of the world. The production in the year 1888 
was nearly 900,000 boxes, which found a ready sale, some 
of it in foreign countries. 

How to seed Raisins.— Spread a damp cloth on the 
table and on it place a bowl for receiving^ the stoned fruit. 
"With the raisins on the left, a bowl of water in which to 
dip the fingers, when they become sticky on the right, it is 
easy to squeeze the raisins between tne thumb and finger 
with one hand, and hold the pen-ki^ife which is used to re- 
move seeds with the other. The seeds will drop on the 
cloth. 

Raisins Stewed. — Scald large raisins in boiling water^ 
let them fetand ten minutes, then remove the seeds. Boil 
them slowly till tender, sweeten to taste, and if any flavor ig 
desired use lemon juice. They make a nice winter lunch 
sauce. 

Raisin Pie.— Boil two cups of raisins slowly for an hour 
i n sufficient water not to have theui very dry. When cool re- 
move the seeds. Line a pie-plate with paste, over which 
sprinkle a scant half cupful of su^ar and a tablespoonful of 
flour. Pour in the raisins, cover with an upper crust, and 
bake. 

Raisin Puffs.— Take one cup sugar, two eggs, one- 
fourth cup butter, one-fourth cup sweet milk, one teaspoon- 
f ul baking-powder, and flour to make a rather thick batter, 
one cup raisins, and flavoring to taste. Grease em many 
coffee cups as yoa desire puffs, and fill each half full. 



118 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Place in a steamer over boiling water. Serve with sweet- 
ened cream. 

Raisins and Kliubarb Pie.— Cut rhubarb into inch 
lengths and stew as usual, or rather scald in boiling water. 
To every cupful of the rhubarb then add half a cupful of 
raisins that have been seeded and stemmed. Bake a« usual 
between two crusts after having been sweetened to taste. 

Raisins and Kice.— Seed raisins enough to make one 
cupful and a half, and let a quart of fresh water come to a 
hard boil. Into it stir three-fourths of a cup of rice, very 
slowly, and then the raisins. Boil rapidly twenty-five min- 
utes. If there are signs of sticking to the bottom of the 
kettle stir carefully with a fork, but do not break the 
grains. When each grain is tender pour o^ the water, if 
any is left, turn raisins and rice into t^e dish in which they 
are to be served, stand in a cool oven, uncovered, or on the 
back of the stove a few minutes and serve with sugar and 
cream. A richer dish hi made by cooking the soaked rice 
with milk in a double boiler. 

Raisin and Rice Pudding.— Cook two thirds of a 
cupful of washed rice in a quart of new milk till it is soft. 
Then stir in one cupful and a half of milk, one cupful of 
sugar, atablespoonfulof butter, one teaspoonful of cinna 
mon, and one and one half cupful of seeded raisins. Bake 
slowly nearly two hours. 

The above is only one of many ways in which raisins are 
used in puddings. 

Raisin Pudding.— Mix together one scant cupful of 
butter witn one cupful of milk, three-quarters of a cupful of 
molasses, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and half as much 
cloves, with flour for a thick batter. Add an even teaspoon- 
ful of soda and one pound of seeded raisins. Steam four 
hours. 

Raisin Pie.-»eed one pound of raisms and boil slowly 
one hour in a little water. Into them stir two tablespoon- 



]RA»PBERKIE^. 119 

fills of flour made smooth in a little cold water, one cupful 
of sugar and the juice of one large lemon with a little of 
the grated peel. Bake in two crusts. This amount will 
make two large pies. 

Raisin Spirals.— Two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one-half 
cupful of butter, one cupful of chopped raisins, one half a 
cupful of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the 
milk, spice to taste, and sufficient flour stirred in to make 
the mixture very stiff. Roll out quite thin, cutscripsabjut 
two inches wide and four long, and roll around the finger 
as if curling the hair. Fry in butter till of a delicate 
brown. Sprinkle with granulated sugar. 

Raisin Cake.— (For others see Miscellaneous.) One cup 
of sugar, half a cup of butter, three eggs, half a cup of 
sweet milk, one cup heaping full of chopped raisins, two 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and about two cups of 
flour; flavor with nutmeg. Put the butter, sugar, well- 
beaten egers and milk together, then stir in the flour and 
raisins. The latter should be slightly warmed and floured 
to prevent sinking to the bottom. 



THE EASPBERRY. 

Raspberry . Buns.— Mix six ounces each of ground rice 
and flour, rub in a quarter of a pound of lard, the same of 
white sugar, and a teaspoonful of baking-powder. Make 
into a stiff paste with the yolk of one egg and a little milk. 
Divide into pmall balls, hollow each and insert a little 
raspberry jam, close up neatly and dip into beaten white 
of the egg, flatten a little and bake on a tin in a sharp 
oven. They will crack during the baking and show the 
jam through. 

Raspberry Blanc-niangre.— In a scant quart of boiling 
new milk stir four tablespoonfuls of coi*n-starch made 
smooth in a quarter of a cupful of milk, and add to it, while 
thickening, four tablespoonf uls of sugar. When cooked stir

from fresh berries sweetened. Turn into a mould, cool and 
Serve with sweet cream. The juice from cherries, berries, 
or peaches may also be used to Havor blanc-mange. 

Raspberry Pudding, No. 1.— Beat the yolks of two 
eggs and stir into a cupful of sugar and a large tablespoon- 
ful of butter creamed together. Then add one and one 
half cupf uls of milk, the whites of two eggs beaten stiff and 
enough flour for a rather thick cake batter, with a helping 
teaspoonf ul of baking-powder. Lastly mix in a pint of fresh 
raspberries. Bake and eat with berry or any other liquid 
sauce, or with custard. 

KaKspberry Pudding,No.2.— Boil one pint of milk and 
into it stir two large tabiespoonfuis of wheat flour which 
have been made smooth with a little cold milk. Add two 
eggs beaten with half a cupful of sugar. Pour a large cup- 
ful of stewed raspberries or raspberry jam over the bottom 
of a pudding-dish, pour over the custard and bake. The 
same pudding may be baked in pudding-cups. First turn 
in a spoonful of berries, then two- thirds fill the cup with 
custard. Set the cups in a dripping-pan, pour boiling water 
to half till it and steam in the oven half an hour. 

Raspberry Pudding, No. 3.— Boil a pint of rich new 
milk or milk and cream, and thicken it with four tabiespoon- 
fuis of flour (which is always far nicer than corn-starch for 
thickening), made smooth in a cupful and a half o raspberry 
juice. Boil till it thickens, stirring constantly. Then stir 
in one cupful of sugar and serve cold in glasses with 
whipped cream. Any other fruit juice may be substituted 
for that of raspberry. 

Raspberry Pie.— Bake in two crusts a large half pint of 
well sweetened berries with a fourth o' a cupful of water 
mixed with one teaspoonf al of flavoring. 

Raspberry Short-cake.— Rub three tabiespoonfuis of 
butter or lard into a quart of flour, sifted with three tea- 
spoonf uls of baking-powder, until it is fine, then add milk

until it is as soft as it can be rolled out. Handle as little as 
possible. Make i t about half an inch thick, bake, and invert 
the bottom of the cake for the layer of berries. Pile them 
on an inch thick with bits of butter, dredge with sugar and 
put over them another crust made and baked like the first. 
When cut in sections, pour over sweet cream or whipped 
cream. In place of i t use a sauce made by creaming to- 
gether three times as much sugar as batter, then adding an 
eggf white and yolk beaten stiff, and then stirring in, sloAvly, 
half a cupful of rich milk. It is a substitute for cream. 
Strawberry short-cake is made in this manner, also peach 
short-cake. The latter fruit is peeled and sliced fine and 
sugared. This cake may be eaten warm or cold. 

Raspberry Roll.— Cut thin pie paste into square strips, 
spread with raspberry jam, roll over, tie at the ends an d 
bake. 



THE STRAWBERRY. 

This most delicious beny of all that grows is best served 
fresh from the vines with sugar and cream. If the plants 
are mulched, as they should be, the fruit needs no washing; 
otherwise they should be carefully picked over, placed in a 
colander and cold water allowed to run through till the 
sand and dust have all passed out. Cap them afterward, 
just before serving, and let each person sugar them accord- 
ing to taste. 

A beautiful dish is made by filling a crystal bowl with 
lai'ge crimson selected strawberries, served uncapped. 
They are held by the stems and dipped in powdered sugar, 
one by one. A more luxurious way is to heap high a 
generous plateful and stand by each a tiny sugar-holder 
and cream-jug. It is a fitting concomitant of June roses, 
sunshine and greenery. 

It is a mistake to eat the strawberry with cake c»r ice-

cream. Under these blandishments its true flavor is 
dulled if not lost. A roll or a biscuit with fresh unsalted 
butter affords a fitting background f or the indescribab le 
and unapproachable flavor of a fruit which appeals so ex- 
quisitely to three senses, those of sififht, smell and tasta. 
Sydney Smith could not help saying "Doubtless God 
could liave made a better berry than the strawberry but 
He never did. " It was a stupid world that did not say it 
when the fruit firrit ripened. 

Like all fruit, perfeat strawberries are best served entire 
and uncooked. Heat injures that fine volatile flavor which 
is a part of their individuality. When cream is plentiful 
it makes a good change to crush the berries, press them 
through a sieve, and beat them into thick sweet cream. 
They may be spread upon short-cake and between its 
layers. Garnish with a ring of ripe large berries about the 
edge and a little pyramid in the center. 

It was the true poet and aiiist who wrote 

" O marvel, fruit of fruits, I pause 
To reclcou Thee. I ask what cause 
Set free so much of red from deats 
At core of earth and mixed such sweetrt 
With sour and spice: what was thatstrengrth 
Which out of darlcness leuarth by len^h 
Spun all thy shining: thiead of vine. 
Netting- the fields in bond as th!ne, 
1 see thy tendrils drlnlc by sips 
From ^ra?s and clover's smiling: lips, 
I see the wild bees as they fare. 
Thy cups of honey drink but sp^tre." 

Strawberries and Whipped Cream.— Sift powderecl 
sugar over a layer of hulled and waj?hed strawberries, 
arranged in a deep dish, and cover with strawberries again, 
then with sugar, till the dish is nearly filled. This should 
be done just before they are served. Pour over them a 
large cupful of cream whipped with the whites of two 
eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Strawberries and Oranges.— CJover a quart of straw- 
berries with powdered sugar, pour over them half a tea- 
cupful of orange juice and serve at once. Very delicious. 



STRAWBERRIES. 123 

Crushed Strawberries.— Where strawberries a-^e small 
or inferior in appearance they may be crushed, sweetened 
ana mixed with the beaten whites of two or three eggs. 
Berries and eggs should first be thoroughly chilled on ice, 
then served as soon as mixed. 

Strawberry Mould.— (dood Health.) Prepare some 
strawberry juice by putting fresh berries in a jar and 
placing it in a kettle of hot water until the juice flows 
freely from the berries, then strain. Have a half cupful of 
sago soaked for an hour in just water enough to cover. 
Boil the sago in a quart of the fruit juice until thick like 
jelly. Pour into moulds, put in a cold place, and when 
needed serve with sugar and whipped cream. 

Strawberry Custard.— Make a boiled custard with the 
yobcs of five eggs, a quart t.f milk, half a cupful of sugar 
and a trifle of flavoring. Crush and strain one pint of berries, 
mix in half a cup of powdered sugar and gradually beat 
this into the well-beaten whites of the four eggs with two 
or three tablespoonf uls of sugar, according to the acidity 
of the fruit. Serve the custard in shallow dishes with 
two tablespoonfuls of the float upon each. 

Strawberry Short-Cake, No. 1.— Into a pint of flour 
sifted with a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder rub an 
even tablespoonf ul of butter. Stir in milk enough for a 
very soft dough, a half pint will be suflScient. It is to be 
quickly handled without rolling; flatten it out with the 
hand about three-quarters of an inch thick; it will be 
double that height when baked. Time, about eighteen 
minutes. Take from the oven and cut it in large sections 
or squares with a hot knife to prevent heaviness, and tear 
each section apart with the fingers. Butter the split sides 
and over them spread fresh berries either whole and dredg- 
ed with sugar or crushed and sweetened. Pile one section 
on its other half and serve with cream if possible, if not 
with sauce made as described in Raspberry short-cake. 
A good sized short-cake should double this recipe. If 
made a little thicker it. can be torn apart while entira

Invert the top, cover with berries and proceed as b8fo»*e. 

Another way is to roll into four thin pieses, fitting each 
to a jelly tin. Butter two of them on the tins, very lightly, 
and lay a second piece of dough over the first When 
baked tear them apart, butter, cover with berries and pile 
one on the other. This m thod prevents the possibility of 
heaviness and insures the short-cake good when cold. A 
thin frosting over the top is excellent 

Strawberry Sbort-Cake, No. 2.— Mix two heaping 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder with one quart of flour. 
Beat one eg'^, mix in two tablespDonf uls of malted butter 
and one of sugar, with nearly one pint of new milk, and 
stir all together. Make it thin as can be handled, knead 
little and bake in two or three pans. Run a hot knife 
around the edges, pull apart with the fingers, butter 
the split sides, p.nd over them spread fresh berries, either 
whole and dredged with sugar, or crushed and sweet- 
ened. Pile one section on the other, and se^ve. if possible, 
with cream. The cake should be about three-fourths of 
an inch thick before baking, and from fifteen to eighteen 
minutes will be time enough. 

Strawberry Sbort-Cake, No. •?. -(C+ood Health.) Beat 
together one cupful of thin cream, slightly warmed, a 
tablespoonful of yeast, and two small cupfuls of flour. Set 
in a warm place till very light. Add sufficient warm flour to 
mix soft Knead thoroughly for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Divide into two equal portions, and roll into two sheets 
about one-half inch in thickness, making the centers a 
very little thinner tlian the outside, po that when risen they 
will not be highest in the center. Place in tins, and set in 
a warm place until perfectly risen, or until they have 
doubled their first thickness. Bake quickly. 

Prepare the fruit by chopping or mashing, if large, 
sweeten to the taste, and add a little cream if desired. 
Spread one cake with fruit, and cover with the other. 

Strawberry Pudding*.— Make a jam by mashing fresh 
strawberries and sweetening to the taste. Spread slices of 



BTRAWBEREIES. 1S(J5 

light whole wheat bread with the jam, and pile them one 
above another in a pudding dish. Pour over the whole 
thin cream sufficient to moisten well ; cut into pieces and 
serve. A simple custard may be used in the place of the 
cream if preferred. 

Strawberry Dumplingrs.— (Table Talk.) Put one pint 
of sifted flour into a bowl, rub into it two ounces of butter, 
add a leaspoonful of salt, a heaping teaspoon ful of bak- 
ing-powder and Hufficient milk to moisten, about one gill; 
mix quickly, take out on a board and roll out into a sheet a 
quarter of an inch in thickness, cut into cakes with a round 
biscuit cu titer, put about three strawberries in each cake, 
fold them over neatly and steam about twenty minutes. 
While they are steaming make the 

Strawberry Sauce. 

Beat two ounces of butter to a cream, adding gradually 
four ounces or a half cup of powdered sugar, then add 
twelve strawberries, one at a time, mashing and beating 
until the whole is perfectly light. If i t has a separated or 
curdled appearance, add a little more sugar and stand in a 
cold place until wanted. 

Strawberry Pie. — Line a pie-plate with thin paste and 
set in the oven till nearly baked. Take from the oven and 
fill with sugared berries, dredge with flour, coyer the top, 
diamond- wise, with narrow strips of paste, return to the 
oven and finish baking.

THE TAMARIND. 

The fruit of this beautiful leguminous tree is delight- 
fullv acid, Ifc is preserved with sugar ia the tropics 
where alone it is found. A native of Africa and India, 
the tamarind grows to the height of sixty feet. In the 
midst of its thick foliage gleam white blossoms which soon 
turn yellow and ripen into fruit po ds from three to six 
inches long. Inside of the hard shell is the pulp containing 
seeds. The pulp, which is acid and juicy, is used for a 
cooling laxative drink. 

Tamarinds may be kept by stoning them and packing in 
layers in glass jars, spreading eaoh layer with fine white 
sugar. Cover with sugar and seal 'ip tight.

perfectly smooth. Sugar ought not to be added till just as 
the fruit is ready to be taken from the fire. A little lemon 
juice and peel, those ever- ready givers of flavor, may be 
used where the fruit seems flat and tastele&s. A few Zante 
currants well washed and soaked or raisins heighten the 
taste of an insipid fiuit, not otherwise. They should be 
steeped with it. To preserve the shape, and, it must be said, 
to perfectly preserve the flavor, wash and simmer rapidly 
till it is tender. It should be closely covered with agate or 
earthen. 

French Pancakes with Jelly.— Six eggs, two cupf uls 
of flour, one s.iltspo >nful of salt, two tableip:>o:ifuls of sug- 
ar, the grated rind of a lemon. Beat the whites and yolks of 
the eggs separately. Add one pint olf milk and stir with 
other ingreJients. Lastly, add one tablespoonful of melted 
butter. Butter a frying-pan, pour in a ladleful of batter, 
and fry quickly; then spread on the cake a teaspoonful ot 
melted currant-jell^, and roll up. Servt- six cakes at a time. 
Any kind of jelly may be used. 

Fruit Fritters.— Soak a teacupfnl of fine bread crum')s 
in a cup of hot milk till they are very soft, then stir in a ta- 
blespoonful of flour wet with two tablespoonfuls of cold 
milk. Boil till it thickens, stirring to prevent lumps. To 
this add the wall-bejiten yolk^j of three eggs, when it is sut- 
ficiently cool, then half a teacupf ul of jelly or jam, or small

bc^rries, and lastly the well beaten whites. Fry at once ia 
hot fat 

Fruit DumpiingrSy No. 1.— Into one pint of flour sift 
one heaping teaspoonfal of baking- powder, and rub into it 
one rounded tablespoonful of shortening, either beef snet, 
drippings or butter, making it an fine ah pins' heads. Into 
itstir with aspoon a scant teacupful of water or enough, 
according to the flour, to make a thin batter; if too thick 
it will be heavy. Have ready in a shallow saucepan or 
earthen dish one pint of stewed fruit of any kind, either 
apples, berries, cherries, peaches or plums, into which 
drop the batter, spoonful by spoonful. The fruit may be 
fresh or canned, but must not be too juicy, and must be 
boiling rapidly. When the batter is dropped into it, it will 
run together into one mass. Cover at once and closely, and 
let it boil, without raising the cover or lifting it from its place 
for twenty minutes. If perfectly prepared the crust will be 
light and spongy. Dish immediately into dessert plates and 
serve, as delay may cause the dumpling to fall. It must not 
be mixed till it is cooked. If there is superfluous juice, use 
it in making a liquid sauce for the dumpling. Where milk 
is used in place of water in its preparation, no shortening is 
needed. 

Fruit Turn-overs.— (H. Annette Poole.) For the crust 
tiike one cupful of milk, one egg^ one lip-lf -cupful of sugar, 
shortening the size of a»small walnut, one scant teaspoon- 
ful of soda and two of cream of tartar,* add flour and roll 
out about an eighth of an inch thick. Cut out as large as a 
saucer, put a spoonful of fruit on one half, turn the other 
over it, leaving a rim around the edge which is to be wet 
and turned over. Be very careful to press the edges to- 
gether to prevent the escape of the fruit. Crimp the edges 
with the fingers, place carefully in fat so hot that a bit of 
the dough rises immediately in it, and turn them carefully 
as soon as they rise t«i prevent them from bursting open. 
Brown them evenly, turning as necessary, and be sure that 
the crust is done before lifting them out They may be 
triei with a small-tined fork which should comeouc clean. 
The fruit should be very thick that the juice may not run

out of the pies. These turn-overs are good made out of tart, 
dried or evaporated apples, properly soaked, stewed and 
seasoned. 

Fruit Stewed..— Peaches, greengages, plums and apri- 
cots are to be neatly peeled and stoned and laid in a sauce- 
pan with a pint of cold water t(» a quart of fruit; over it 
(iistribute a proper amount of sugar, and just before the 
fruit comes to a boil skim well. Stir from the bottom of 
the saucepan with a wooden spatula to prevent burning, 
and take from the fire when tender, keeping: them closely 
covered to retain the flavor. When it is desired to retain 
the skins prick them with a large needle and plunge into 
boiling syrup. 

Syrup for preserving Fruit.— To seven pounds of 
granulated sugar add five pints of cold water; stir till well 
heated but do not let it boil. Set aside to use in canning 
fruits or stewing them for sauce. 

Fruit Pies and Tarts.— (Alessandro Fillipini.) The 
chef of Delmonico in his book **The Table'' directs that 
pies and tarts of peach, apricot, pear, * plum, cherry, 
huckleberry, gooseberry, currant, pine- apple, cranberry, 
strawberry, raspberry and blackberry shall be made in the 
following manner: After liniug the bottom of the pie-dish 
or tart-mould with paste in the usual way, cover it wi^^h a 
thin layer of apple marmalade (or apple- sauce) over which 
arrange the fresh fruit above the apple. Then dust with 
powdered sugar and bake in a moderate oven twenty 
minutes. At the end of that time draw them to the oven 
door and sprinkle the edges lightly with sugar, then leave 
them in the closed oven two minutes to allow the sugar to 
melt thoroughly. Remove them from the fire, put to cool 
for twenty minutes, and then spread evenly over the fruit 
one and ono-half ounces of apple jelly. Strawberries, 
raspberries and blackberries are strewed uncooked over 
the marmalade baked in paste, and over that spread a 
layer of the apple jelly.

FRUIT PUDDINGS. 

Fruit Puddings. -All plain paddings are greatly im- 
proved by spreading over them, after baking, a thick layer 
of jam, jelly, or the pulp of stewed fruit Cover the top 
with a meringue madt^ by beating the whites of one, two or 
three eggs with as many tablespoonfuls of sugar, and then 
returning to the oven just long enough to brown lightly. 
The fruit converts an insipid dish into one which recom- 
mends itself to any palate. Paddings of simple rice or 
bread are in this way made pleasant to both sight and 
taste. Frequently the necessity of rich nteaming sauces 
which are both extravagant and unwholesome are thus ob- 
viated. It is impossible t.o describe the many changes 
which may be rung from the apple, cherry, berries of all 
kinds, peaches, plums, quinces, and cocoanuts, but which 
any intelligent housekeeper can vary according to wish and 
time. If jams and jdlies are put up with less sugar than 
usual, that is a little less than pint and pound, the result will 
be more agreeable than where the old measure is adhered 
to. In a dark, dry, cool cellar such fruit will keep equally 
well, especially if canned. 

Fruit Pudding, No. !•— Pour one quart of boiling 
milk over three-quarters of a pound of bread-crumbs add 
six tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonfal of butter, 
three eggs, well-beaten, and half a teaspoonlul of extract 
of vanilla. Put two cups of strawberry, raspberry or peach 
jam into a mould, pour in the batter and ste^m for two 
hours. Cover the mould while steaming. It makes a de- 
licious dessert 

Fuuit Pudding, No. 2. -Mix together one cup of mo- 
lasses, one cup of chopped suet one of milk and three of 
flour with two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, one large

all the while to prevent burning. Pour it into a buttered 
pudding-dish and stir in a large cupful of seeded raisins 
and a teaspoonful of ginger. Set in a moderate oven and 
occasionally stir np from the bottom. At the end of half 
an hour stir in a teacupful of cold milk, oi more if it

beaten. Add two cups of fruit, either chopped apples, rai- 
sins, currants, canned peaches, or apricots,— one, or a mixt.- 
ure of two or more varietietf. When using canned fruit 
drain it from the syrup, and use the latter in making a 
sauce. Vary the sugar according to the fruit. Turn into a 
buttered pudding-mould and steam two hours. 

Fruit Minute Pudding", No. 5.— Measure out one 
quart of rich new milk, reserving half a pint in order to 
wet five large rounded tablespoonfuls of sifted flour. Heat 
the larger portion of the milk, together with one even cup- 
ful of sugar, to a boil in a larina kettle, and turn the hob 
mixture gradually over the cold milk and flour, stirring all 
the while to prevent lumps. Return it to the kettle and 
cook it till it thickens, which will be about ten minutes 
after it begins to boiL Take it off the srove and beat while 
it is cooling. When baK cold add sliced bananas, or whole 
strawberries, whortleberries, raspberries, biackbfTriea 
sliced apricots or peaches. Serve ice cold. The amount 
of fruit will be determined by the taste of the maker.

quince or orange marmalade, or chopped pine-apple, peach, 
cherries, berries, apricots or plums, and bake in a buttered 
pudding-dish in a moderate oven. If desired a meringue 
can be poured over the top, made by beating the whites of 
two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered HUgar to a

FRUIT FILLING FOE LATER CAKE. 

To the almost numberJess ways of concocting fruit fill- 
ing for layer cake woman's inventive genius is constantly 
adding new recipes. Fruit is grated, mashed, stewed and 
made into jellies and marmalades for this sole purpose. 
A favorite method is to incorporate the result with icing. 
Any plain cake may be taken as the base of layer cake, as 
for instance, the foUovring : 

Cake for Fillingr,No. 1.— (Marion Harland ) Three eggs, 
one cup of sugar, butter the size of an egg, one cup of flour, 
one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and half ateaspoonful of 
soda. Bake in jelly tins and spread with jelly or filling. 

Cake for Fillingr,No. 2.— Cream one cupful of powder- 
ed sugar and one tablespoonful of butter, and mix in the 
well- beaten > oiks of three eggs, then the t»tiffly beaten whites 
then three-fourths of a pint of flour, alternately with half a 
cupful of milk, and lastly one heaping teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. 

Almond Filling, No. 1.— Boil half a pint of cream. 
While it is heating mix a teaspoonful of flour with a table- 
spoonful of cold milk and stir into the yolks of three eg^s, 
beaten with two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir the 
whole into the boiling cream and cook till thick. Then 
mix in haif a pound of blanched and chopped almonds and 
spread between the layers. Flavor the icing with almond 
extract. 

Almond Filling, No. 2.— Take one pint; of sweet cream 
a day ol<i. Whip till very fight w i 1 1; an egg-beater. Blanch 



144 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

and chop a pound of almonds. .Stir into the sv^eetened 
whipped cream, and put on the top and between the lay- 
ers. 

Almond FillingTy No. 3.— Blanch a pound of almonds, 
reserve a dozen and chop fine the remainder. Beat the 
whites of three eg^ adding gradually a scant cup of pow- 
dered sugar. When stiff enough to stand alone save out 
enough to ice the top of the cake and mix the chopped al- 
monds with the rest. Spread this between the layers and 
cover the top with the reserved portion. SpUt in two the 
dozen whole almonds and arrange in a garland in the icing 
while soft. 

Apple Filling.— Peel and grate two large sour apples 
and flavor with extract of lemon or lemon peel. Stir in 
one well-beaten egg and one cup of sugar, whip it well, then 
let it simmer in a granite saucepan five minutes, or till it 
thicke7is. If too thin stir in one dessertspoonful of flour, 
made smooth in a little cold water. 

Banana Filling, No. 1.— To five or six peeled and 
m£tshed bananas add the juice of one lemon and h^f a cup 
of sugar. 

Banana Filling, No. 2.— Make an icing as directed in 
Almond filling, and into it stir two finely mashed bananas. 
It will be enough for two layers. U^e double the number 
of bananas for four layers, and so on. Garnish the top with 
thin layers of the fruit if it is to be eaten imiuediately, 
otherwise simply cover it with icing. 

Chocolate Filling, No. 1.— Scrape or grate one square 
of Baker's chocolate aid mix with one cupful of sugar. Stir 
it very slowly into a half-teacupful of boiling milk, then 
mix in the slightly beaten yolks of two eggs. Stir well and 
simmer ten minutes. When cooked flavor with half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and spread between the layers. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 145 

Chocolate Filling' and Icing, No. 2.— Scrape two 
squares of chocolate, min with one capful of brown sugar 
and melt in a small cup over a tea-kettle of boiling water. 
Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, flavor with a 
teaspoon 'ul of vanilla, and carefully mix in the chocolate. 
Beat well, and spread between the layers and upon the top. 
Should it harden too rapidly rewarin over boiling water. 

Chocolate Filling, No, 3.— Scrape two squares of 
chocolate into one half cup of milk, add three heaping 
tablespoonf uls of sugar and boil till thick. Spread between 
and upon the layers. 

Cocoanut Filling, No. 1.— Boil together two cupfuls 
of powdered sugar and half a cupful of water till it snaps 
when dropped in cold water, then beat in slowly the stiff 
beaten whites of two eggs and a teaspoonful of lemon juice 
or vinegar. Beat till cold, then mix in four tablespoonf uls 
of grated or desiccated cocoanut and spread between the 
layers. Strew the top with grated cocoanut mixed with 
half the quantity of sugar. A filling not so rich is made by 
the recipe given in Almond filling. 

Cocoanut Filling, No. 2.— Make a soft icing of the 
whites of three eggs and pulverized sugar, with which cover 
each Iryer thickly. Over it spread fre-ih grated cocoanut or 
desiccated cocoanut, soaked half an hour in a cup of milk. 

Cocoanut Filling, No. 3.— Two cupfuls granulated 
sugar, two-thirds cap millc of the fresh cocoanut, boiled 
together until it will harden when dropped into cold 
water. Beat whites of two eggs to standing froth, pile 
high on large platter, and pour syrup while boiling over 
them, stirring constantly. While cooling add a tablespoon- 
ful more of cocoanut milk and flavor. Reserve enough to 
cover top and sides of cake, and into the remainder put 
one-half cup fresh grated cocoanut and spread quickly 
(before it cools) between the four layers. Then while the

with the desiccated by previously soaking one larg^e capful 
in half cup sweet milk. 

Cranberry Fillingr.— Use rich cranberry jelly as flllinp: 
for layer cake. Cover the top with icing colored a de-licate 
red with a trifle of cranberry juice or cochineal. Arrange 
the slices with alternate squares of cake covered with white 
icing. 

Date Filling,— Pare, core and slice tart apples and stew 
till nearly done, then add a,n equal quantity of stoned dates. 
Cook slowly till the fruit is reduced to a pulp. Sweeten 
with but little sugar as the date** are rich in 6accharine 
matter, and press the pulp through a sieve. Use as a filling 
for layer cake or Washington pie. 

Fig Filling, No. 1.— Separate and wash a dozen large 
fresh figs. Chop them fine, barely cover with water, and 
let them boil to a soft paste. Remove from the fire and at 
once stir into the icing, made by beating stiff the whites of 
four eggs with one cupful of sugar. 

Fig Filling, No. 2.— Boil together one half pound of 
figs and half a cup of water with three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar for five minutes, or until the ingredients make a 
paste. The figs should first be separated, washed and 
chopped moderated fine. While the paste is warm spread 
it between the layers. 

Fig Filling, No. 3.— Boil one pound of pulverized 
sugar in a scant half cup of water till it hairs, and gradual- 
ly stir it into the well-beaten whites of three eggs. Beat 
together till it begins to stiffen. Then reserve one third 
of it for icing and into the remainder stir one pound of 
sliced figs. Flavor with lemon juice and spread between 
the layers and frost the top with the reserved icing, flavored 
with a scant teaspoonf ul of vanilla. 

Fig and Raisin Filling.— Prepare the figs as in the 
preceding recipe, adding halt as many stoned raisins, by 
measure, as of figs. Soak and simmer the raisins cmd when

tender add to them the chopped figs. Shnnier again till 
the figs are soft, then spread between the cak«. An equal 
quantity of figs and raisins may be used. 

Jelly Filling.— Any kind of fruit jelly, jam or marma- 
lade is good to spread between layers of cake or upon a 
single thickness of thin cake. It should be made with 
little or no butter, the jelly spread upon it as soon as the 
cake is taken from the oven, and then tied to cool in a roU, 
which is to be served in thin slices. 

Liemon FillingTy No, 1.— C'ream together one egg and 
one cupful of sugar, stir in one tablespoonful of butter and 
one tablespoonful of flour with two thirds of a cup of water. 
Boil until it thickens, then stir in the grated peel and juice 
of one large or two small lemons. 

Lieinon Filling, No, 2,— Whites of three eggs, three 
cupfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla,, three teaspoon- 
fuls of lemon juice. Pour half a pint of boiling water on 
the sugar and let it boil until clear and almost caudied. 
Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them into the boil- 
ing syrup; remove from the fire and beat thoroughly until 
it becomes a stiff froth; add the lemon juice, and when 
perfectly cold add the vanilla. Spread it between the 
layers and on the top and sides of the calce. 

Orange Filling, No, 1,— Grate part of the yellow rind 
of a juicy orange, then peel and grate that and another, 
remove the seeds, add two tablespoonf uls of water, one 
cupful of sugar, and scald in a farina kettle. Into it stir 
one tablespoonful of corn-starch, made smooth in a little 
cold water, and cook until the corn-starch is thick. Beat 
the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, with one cupful of 
powdered sugar, reserve enough of This to spread upon the 
top, and stir the rest into the orange when it is almost cold. 
Flavor the icing with extract of orange. 

Orange Filling, No, 2,— Beat the white of one egg to a 
froth, gradually adding three-fourths of a pint of powdered

sugar and the grated rind and jaice of one large orange. 

Orange and Cocoanut Cream Filling.— Into one 

egg beaten stiff, yolk and white together, stir one cupful of 
sweet cream, half a cup of sugar, one cup of grated cocoa- 
nut, the juice of one large orange and part of the grated 
peaL With this spread each layer and the top of the cake, 
over which sprinkle fresh grated cocoanut 

Peacli Filling,— Beat till they are stiflf the whites of 
three eggs, adding gradually a scant cupful of powdered 
sugar. Spread a portion of this over the thickest of the 
layers for the bottom of the cake. On this arrange a layer 
of peeled and sliced peaches, and on them place another 
layer of cake. Proceed in the same manner with one or 
two more layers. If the fruit is very ripe it may be mash- 
ed and then stirred into the icing. Nectarine or apricot 
filling may be prepared in the same way. 

Pine-apple Filling.— Make a thick boiled icing in 
which squeeze the juice of two oranges. Spread over the 
layers of cake and sprinkle thick with grated pine-apple. 
To make bailed icing turn half a cup of hot water over 
one cup of granulated sugar and boil until it hairs. Into 
the stiff beaten white of one egg add as much cream of 
tartar as can be heaped upon the point of a penknife, 
and into the egg beat slowly the hot syrup until it is cold 
and thick. 

Raisin Filling, No. 1.— Chop together one cupful of 
seeded raisins and half as many blauv^hed almonds 
and stir into boiled icing, which is made by cooking to- 
gether one cupful of granulated sugar and half a cup of hot 
water till a long thread can be spun from the syrup. Then 
proceed as in the recipe above. The raisins must then 
be stirred in rapidly and the icing spread at once between 
the layers. Leave out the almonds if desired. 

Baisin Filling, No, 2,— Boil a cup of maple syrup till 
it hairs, or dissolve enough maple sugar to make a cupful, 



MISCELLANEOUS. 143 

stirring in two teaspoonfuls of vinegar to prevent graining, 
then add a cupful of seeded and chopped raisins and stir 
till cold. 

Hickory Nut Filling.— Make an icing of three beaten 
whites and as many cups of pulverized sugar and spread on 
each side of the layers. Cover the top of each with the 
meats of nuts. 

Raspberry and Strawberry Filling:,— Cover each 
cake layer with icing made like that given in Almond cake, 
and over each spread another of fresh fruit. Let them be 
of berries selected for their size and sweetness and care- 
fully arranged. 

Tutti Frutti Filling, No. 1.— Chop very fine two 
ounces of citron, then add a quarter of a pound of fresh 
figs and chop till these are also fine. Add two- thirds of a 
cupful of blanched almonds and chop again. Chop sepa- 
rately three tablespoonfu s of seeded raisins and mix with 
the rest. Make an icing as in Almond filling, into which, 
with a fork, lightly mix the chopped fruit. Place it between 
the layers while the cake is warm. 

Tutti Frutti Filling, No. 2.— Into the white of one 
ef^g beaten stiff stir one cupful of seeded and chopped 
raisins, half a cupful of grated cocoanut, half a cupful of 
chopped almonds and one heaping tablespoonful of sugar. 
The raisins and almonds should be chopi>ed to a paste. 



FRUIT, JELLIES, JAMS AND MARMALADES. 

Apple Jelly, No. 1.— For this purpose use sour apples 
whicl\ have both flavor and juice. Wash, cut out defects, 
and slice in small pieces retaining both core and skin. 
Throw into a granite or porcelain kettle with just enough 
water to cover them, stew slowly till they are soft, and press 
gently through a flannel jelly-bag. Boil the juice half an 



150 PEUrrS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

hoar, then add, by measure, half as much sugar as juice. 
Return to the kettle and boil a few minutes, or till it jellies 
when dropped on a plate. One quince to every dozen apples 
finives a rich flavor to the jelly. Crab-apples require a Utile 
more sugar, a heaping cupful to a pint of juice. 

Apple Jelly, No. 2.— Take apples of the best quality, 
good flavor, not sweet, cut up and stew till soft; strain out 
the juice, letting none of the pulp go through. Boil to the 
thickness of molasses, then weigh, and add as many pounds 
of crushed sugar, stirring until all is dissolved. Add one 
ounce of extract of lemon to every twenty pounds of jelly, 
and when cold set away in close jars. It will keep for 
years. 

Apple Jam, No. 1. -(Mrs. Parsons.) Pare and core tart 
apples and chop them fine. To etich pound of apples use 
three-fourths of a pound of sugar, and <he juice and finely 
cut rind of one lemon, and for three pounds of apples one 
heaping teaspoonf ul of ginger. Stew apple, sugar, lemon 
and ginger one hour, then put in cans or glasses and cover 
well. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

Apple Jam, No. 2.— (Mrs. Cornelius.) Weigh equal 
quantities of brown sugar and sour apples. Pare, core and 
chop them fine. Make a syrup of the sugar and clarify it 
thoroughly, then add the apples, the grated peel of two or 
three lemons and a few pieces of white ginger. Boil till 
the apples look clear and yeUow. The ginger is essential to 
its peculiar excellence. 

Apple Marmalade.-r-Pare and core sour apples, chop 
them moderately fine and stew with a little water, allowing 
three-fourths of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
When reduced to a fine pulp put it in pint cans or jelly jars. 
This is nice for tarts. 

Barberry Jelly.— Wash, stew, mash and strain the ber- 
ries. Boil the juice half an hour and allow, by measure, 
two-thirds as much sugar as juice. Drop in the heated

sugajr and boil ten minutes, or even less, if it iellies when 
dropped from the spoon. 

Blackberry Jelly,— Like all other fruit the common 
blackberry is better for this purpose than the finer varieties. 
The berries should be plucked before they are fully ripe. 
They she uld be cooked in a very little water, or bt^tter, in a 
stone jai set upon a few sticks or a false bottom in a larger 
kettle of cold water a.nd boiled till they will easily mash. 
Squeeze through a flannel jelly-bag, boil the juice twenty 
minutes in a porcelain or granitized kettle, allow a pound 
of sugar for every pint of juice, heat it in the oven, and boil 
up again, then turn into jelly tumblers that have been 
made scalding hot 

Blackberry Jam.— To every pound of berries put three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar, and stir often to prevent burn- 
ing. Cook slowly till the berries are mashed and well done. 
A little currant jelly or lemon peel increases the flavor. 

Clierry Jelly,— Wash and stone the cherries and heat, 
without the addition of water, in a stone jar or i)orcelain 
kettle. Then proceed precisely as in Blackberry jelly. 

Crab-apple Jelly.— Cut Siberian crab-apples to pieces, 
but do not pare or remove the seeds, which impart a pleas- 
ant flavor to the fruit. Put into a stone jar, set in a pot of 
hot water, and let it boil eight or nine hours. Leave in the 
jar all night, covered closely. Next morning squeeze out 
tiie juice, allow pound for pint, and proceed as in all jellies. * 
Should the apples be very dry, add a cup of water for every 
six pounds of fruit. 

Cranberry Jelly, No. 1.— To every quart of cranberries 
allow a dozen large tart apples, which are the best cut up 
without skins and seeds and boiled with the berries till all 
are tender. Strain through a jelly-bag, and to every pint 
of this allow a scant pint of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen 
minutes, skim, and then add the heated sugar. Boil fifteen 
minutes longer, or till it jellies, when dropped from the 
spoon, then pour into glasses or bowls. 



152 FEUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Cranberry Jelly, No, 2.— Pick over the cranberries, 
wath, and put into a porcelain kettle with a cup of 
water to a gallon of berries. When soft mash with a wood- 
en spoon and turn through a strainer fine enough to retain 
skins and seed a Take equal quantities of the pulp and 
sugar heated in the oven and boil, stirring constantly to 
Ijrevent burning. Cook about eight minutes from the time 
when it begins to boil, and turn into hot bowls or glasses. 

Cranberry Marmalade.— Press the cranberries 
through a sieve fine enough to retain the skin^, and sweet- 
en the pulp with half its measure of sugar. Boil slowly an 
hour, or till it thickens when drof ped from the spoon on a 
cold saucer, and pour into glasses. 

Currant Jam,— Measure the curranto and to every 
quart measure out two- thirds of a quart of sugar. Mash 
the fruit and cook one liour, stirring frequently to prevent 
burning. Then add the sugar, and stir and simmer for fif- 
teen minutes, then put up in hot cans or hot jars. 

Currant Jelly.— Select fruit fully ripe but not stale. 
The sooner it is used after turning red the better jelly it 
makes, and a dry sunny day is almost indis )ensable. 
Wash the currants and pick out imperfections and leaves, 
but do not stem them. If convenient use one-fourth or 
one-fifth the quantity of raspberries as of currante. Scald 
the fruit and strain through a jelly-bag without applying 
much pressuie. Measure the juice and take the same 
quantity of sugar, if currants alone are used, if berries are 
added take a scant measure of sugar, a little more than 
two-thirds. Spread it upon shallow plates and set in the 
open oven where it can be stirred to prevent burning. 
Boil the juice twenty minutes, skimming often, then pour in 
the hot sugar. Simmer gently ten minutes, by which time 
the juice ought to begin to thicken when dropped into a 
cool saucer, then dip into hot glasses, and cover closely 
when cool. If it does not thicken at once, set in the sun. 

The following recipe is vouched for by several persons 
wl.ohave tried it 



MISCELLANEOUS. 1 53 

Cold Currant Jelly,— (Mrs. Robinson.) Crush the cur- 
rants in an earthen jar, takipg care not to crush the seeds, 
then pour them on a fine wire sieve and let the juice filter 
through. When they no longer drip, put them into a 
coarse muslin bag and squeeze the remaining juice into an- 
other dish. This last is to be made into jelly by itself, as it 
is not so clear as that which has filtered through the sieve 
without assistance. The first must be examined closely 
and if not perfectly clear, strained again; then weigh it, 
and allow two pounds of granulated sugar to one of juice. 
Mix and stir until it has become perfectly blended, so there 
will be no grains of the sugar to be seen on the spoon when 
lifted out. Now cover the jar and put it into a very cold 
cellar for twenty-four hours, or into an ice-chest, stirring it 
thoroughly every two or three hours during the day and 
evening, and again early in the morning. It can not be 
stirred too much, as on its i erfect blending depends your 
success. It is worth trying, for it is superior in flavor to all 
jellies. At the end of twenty- four hours it can be poured 
into jelly glasses and sealed up. It must be kept in a very 
cool place, and is not to be touched for four or five months. 

Green Gooseberry Jam.— Cut oflf the stems and blos- 
som ends and throw them into the preserving kettle. Al- 
low two and a half pounds of fruit. Mash it with a wooden 
spoon and boil rapidly ten minutes before adding the sugar. 
Cook forty minutes, stirring to prevent burning, and seal 
in tumolers or jars. 

Grape Jam.— Slip off the skins and put them in an 
earthen cish and boil the pulp in a porcelain kettle till the 
seeds are separated. Most of them can ba skimmed from 
the surface of the juice and pulp, the remainder will sink 
to the bottom when the kettle is set back from the fire. To 
the pulp, juice and skins together take three-fourths their 
weight in sugar, but do not add. the sugar till the fruit has 
boiled half an hour. Then let it just come to a boil and 
seal in cans. For most tastes half as much sugar as iruit 
will be sweet enough. 



IM FHUITS AND flow TO USE TflEM- 

Grape Jelly,— Select frnit that is hardly ripe: the wild 
grape may be used while green. Mash with a wooden 
spoon, throw into a preserving kettle, and cook fifteen min- 
utes. Strain through a ielly-bag, boil up the juice, skim- 
ming it well, then add a pint of hot pulverized sugar to 
ever/ pint of juice. Boil ten minutes and seaJ. This is the 
usual formula in regard to sugar, but a third less sugar 
keeps equally well and 's tuJly as palatable. 

Orange Marmalade, No, !•— (Mrs. Todd in Good 
Housekeeping.) Grate the outer yellow rind, which con- 
tains the essential oil, from the fruit used for marmalade 
and pour over it enough boiling water to soften it. Then 
peel the skins off all the fruity taking care to remove all the 
white inner rind, and cut the fruit in pieces. Remove all 
the seeds and save the juice. Pour cold water over the 
fikins and let them boil till they are thoroughly ten- 
der, then take them out, strain them, j nd scrape the 
strings from the inner side with a knife. This done, cut 
them into very thin, even strips. While this is being done 
the syrup must be preparing in this manner: The weight 
of the oranges in jump sugar is put in a porcelain kettle 
with one pint of water to every two pounds of sugar and 
the well-beaten white of one egg. Let it come to a boil 
slowly, skim, pour in a little cold water, and as the scum 
rises skim a^ain. Let the skimmings drain through a hair 
sieve and return the dripping syrup to the kettle. Into 
this clarified syrup throw the thin strips of orange peel and 
simmer till they are transparent. Then add juice and pulp 
and the water strained from the grated peeling. Let it 
boil till it jellies by trying with a spoonful dropped into a 
cool plate. Then turn into moulds or glasses, and let them 
stand till the next day. Cover with thin paper wet with al- 
cohol, and over that tie another soaked in white of egg. 
This is called chip marmalade. 

Orange Marmalade, No. 2.— (Smooth.) This is made 
like the *-chip" except that the rinds are boiled very soft 
and ponnded in a mortar. Mix them by degrees into the 
syrup with a spoon till they are thoroughly incorporated,

which must be done before the boiling begins again. 
When they are well blended stir in the juice and pulp, re- 
turn to the fire and boil till it becomes one mass, which is 
when the color is clear and the mass heavier in stirring. 
Then, after the grated peel is pounded in a mortar the 
marmalade is taken off the fire and the grated peel stirred 
in. Return to the fire and boil up again. In using bitter 
oranges keep out a portion of the grated peel, unless it is 
desired very bitter. Manufacturers generally use about 
one-third of the peel. 

Orange Marmalade, No, 3. —Quarter some large, ripe 
fruit; remove the rind, seeds, and ^laments, taking care to 
save the juice. Put the pulp and juice into a porcelain 
kettle, and mix with an equal quantity of strained honey, 
adding sufficient powdered sugar to make it sweet, as the 
honey will not sweeten it enough. Boil and skim till very 
thick, smooth, and clear. When cold put it in jars. 

. Orange Marmalade, No, 4,— Grate the yellow rind 
and carefully pare off the tough white skin. Remove pits 
and stringy portions and cut the soft pulp fine. For every 
pound of pulp and grated peal take a pound of white lump 
sugar and half a cup of water. Make it into a syrup and 
skim, then stir in the oranges and boil half an hrur. Turn 
into glasses and set in the sun. Seal or tie when hard. 

Orange Marmalade, No, 5,— Make a thick rich apple- 
marmalade out of sour, tender fruit, using a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit; while still hot stir into it the pulp 
and juice of oranges, prepared as in No. 4, except that the 
oranges need not be quite as sweet as pound for pound. 
Simmer and stir till the fruit is very thick, then tie up in 
jars or cans. The proportion of apple to orange may vary 
according to taste; one-fourth an much orange as apple will 
make a good marmalade. 

Orange Jam.— (The Home Maker.) Cut twelve oranges 
in very thin slices p.nd seed them. Add to them six pints 
cold water, leaving it standing all night Then add six 
pounds of sugar and boil till it thickens into jam. 



18« PBUrrS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Peach Marmalade.— Select rich juicy frait, p«*pe, stone;* 
andweigii, and heat slowly, asing no water but its own jaic- 
es. Crack the Icemels of one third of the pits, cat the n 
up and stew in a pint of wat^r for half an hour, then strain 
out the liquor, which i« to be added to the peaches after 
they have been boiling three-quarters of an hour and have 
been reduced to a smooth jam by the heat and by mashing. 
At the same time add three-fourths of a pouad of sugnr to 
every pound of peaches and the juice of a lemon to every 
four pounds of jam. Boil ten minutes, skim and seal. 

Peach Jelly,— Peel and stone the peaches, crack- 
ing a dozen pits out of a measure in ord^r to flavor the 
fruit with the kernela Slice the fruit fine and co^k until 
the whole is reduced to a pulp. A teacupful of water must 
be added to every four quarts of fruit. Express the juice as 
in other jellies, adding the juice of one le;non and two or- 
anges to every pint Proceed as in other recipes. It is 
much better to make peaches into marmalade, since it is 
almost impossible to separate much juice from the pulp. 
Plum jelly is made like the peach except that the pits are 
not needed as flavoring. 

Pear Jelly,— Peel and quarter juicy ripe pears 
and stew with a very little water, taking care to prevent burn- 
ing. If cooked in a double bailer the addition of water 
will not be needed. When reduced to a pulp strain through 
a sieve so as to leave only the juice, taking care to squeeze 
out none of the pulp. Boil twenty minutes, add sugar, 
heated and measured as in other jellies, heat till it thickens 
and pour into jelly tumblers. This is obviously not a fruit 
will calculated for jelly 

Pear 3Iarmalade,— Proceed as for pear jelly but press 
the pulp through a coaraer sieve. Put over the fire ag.iin 
and stir consttuutly to prevent burning. When it becomes 
quite thick add a pound of sus:ar for every pint of pulp, 
measured befoie it has boiled the second time, simmer gen 
^^ly, and put in jars of glas-i or stone. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 157 

Quince Jelly, -Wash carefully and cut out all dark 
specks. Cut in pieces without paring or coring, and stew 
very slowly in enough water to cover the fruit When soft 
strain, boil twenty minutes and add, by measure, one-fourth 
the quantity of sugar. Boil until it jellies when dropped 
upon a cold plate. As it is difficult to press out all the ge- 
latinous juice it is \^ell to pour hot water upon the pulp in 
the jelly-bag and press it through slowly. This diluted 
juice will be found serviceable in stewing apples or quinces 
again. An excellent jelly is made by adding a quarter or a 
ihird the quantity of sour apples to the quinces. 

Quince and Apple Jelly.— Cut small and core an 
equal weight of tart apples and quinces. Put the quinces 
in a preserving kettle, with water to cover them, and boil 
till soft; add the apples, still keeping water to cover, 
and boil till the whole is nearly a pulp. Pub the whole in- 
to a jelly-bag, and strain without pressing. To each quart 
*>f juice allow two pounds of lump sugar. Boil together 
half an hour. 

Quince Marnialade.—Wash, peel and core the fruit, 
dropping it into water to prevent its turning black, and 
stew the cores and peelings for three hours, in enougu wa- 
ter to cover them. Strain out the gelatine in a stout jelly- 
bag without pressure, adding a little bailing water after the 
first juice is expressed, to rinse off all that remains. The 
liquor should then be put on to boil with the quinces and 
stirred often till the fruit is red uced to a fine jam. Then add 
the sugar, which need be only three fourths the weight of 
the peeled quinces, boil up once, skim them, seal in cans 
or put in glasses, and cover with oiled paper pasted tightly 
v-round the tops. 

Raspberry Jam.— Weigh the berries and allow three- 
fourths tlieir weicht in sugar. Put the fruit on the stove 
in a porcelain kettle and mash with a wooden spoon. 
When mashed turn in currant juice, a pint of juice to every 
two quarts of berries or even more; the proportion ought 
to suit the taste of the housekeeper. A little currant juice

gives individuality tci the berry. Let it boil, skimming oft- 
en. Then add the sugar, let it boil haj-d once, stirring all 
the time, and seal or put up in bowls. 

Raspberry Jelly,— Make like Blackberry Jelly. 

Strawberry Jam.— Select small, sweet strawberries, 
wash, hull and weigh them, allowing three-fourths as much 
sugar as fruit Mash the berries over the range in a porce- 
lain or granite-lined kettle, with a wooden masher or 
spoon, allowing a large teacupf ul of water, or even more if 
the fruit is not juicy, to every four pounds of fruit 
Boil half an hour, stirring constantly, then pour in the sug- 
ar, which should have been heating in the oven. Boil 
twenty minutes, then seal in cans. Pint cans are most con- 
venient 

Strawberry Jelly,— Take fresh fruit, hardly ripe, and 
boil in a glass or stone jar set within a kettle having a false 
bottom to keep the jar from the fire. When the berries are 
soft, squeeze through a jelly-bag, measure the juice and al- 
low for each pint, as usual, a pound of su^ar. Heat the 
sugar as in curranH jelly and boil the juice twenty minutes 
or thirty if it is a damp day. Then turn in the sugar, stir 
to prevent burning, let it boil up once, and turn into jelly 
tumblers standing in hot water. 



PEUIT P A.STES AND JELLIES WITHOUT SUGAR. 

II is not generally know.) that fruit juice may be boiled to 
a jelly without sugar. Mash the fruit and strain, boil down

celain till it begins to thicken. Finish drying in shallow 
dishes till it is of the consistency of jelly and about one tenth 
of its first measure. Pack it in pfla^s or earthen, and it 
will keep during the summer. It can be diluted for sauces 
or beverages. It is useful for picnics and camping parties, 
or where fresh fruit is not easily obtained or canned fruit 
is too cumbrous to carry. 



DRIED FRUITS. 

Since the days of canning, drier! fruit has fallen into un- 
deserved disrepute, and it is a pit}', since drying preserves 
the flavor of many fniits better than aay other process of 
preservation. 

Inferior fruit can be made into jellies and jams, unripe 
fruit may be stewed and preserved, but fruit for drying 
must be of the first quality and thoroughly ripe. 

Paring-machines are cheap enough to come within reach 
of every family, but they should be used only upon apples. 
In sections of the country where this fruit does not keep 
well it is a good plan to dry a few in the fall. As for berries 
an J other fruitR, there are many who have not time to can, or 
who have no cool closet room for jars, to whom dried fruit 
will be a luxury. 

Apples dried,— Drop pared apples Into cold water to 
prevent discoloration, cut into eighths and dry on frames 
covered with cheese-cloth or coarse netting. They should 
be supported on posts in the sunshine, away from flies and 
dust, a id carefully covered. Turn over the pieces every 
day, and when thoroughly dry store in paper bags where 
they aie away from the reach of insects. 

In stewing dried apples pick over the fruit, wash in two 
watery, ftud cook in boiling water haU an hour. By this 



160 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

process ot fast boiling the flavor is preserved and the fruit 
retains its shape. Keep closely covered while cooking. 

Dried Berries.— Pick over the fruit, spread on old 
earthen plates and sprinkle thick with sugar. Set them on 
a table in the sun and cover with netting, supported so as 
not to touch the fruit. Finish drying in a cool stove oven 
when the fruit has shrunken one half. Turn often with a 
silver knife. Pack in bags and stew in hot water. 

Dried Currants.— One pint gugar to one pint stemmed 
currants. Put them together i n a porcelain kettle, a layer of 
currants at the bottom; wh^n the sugar is dissolved to a 
syrup let them boil one or two minutes. Skim from the 
syrup, and spread on plates to dry in a partially cooled oven. 
Boil the sv^rup until thickened, pour it over the currants, 
and dry with them. Pack in jars, and cover closely. 
Blackberries may he dried in the same manner. 

Dried Clierries.— Stone the cherries with a machine 
which comes for that purpose, throwing in a few pits, and 
over thetn strew a little white sugar. Stir them gently and 
let them stand a few hours. Drain off the juice and put in 
a preserving kettle, let it come to a boil and throw in the 
cherries Let them cook up once and then spread on plates 
to dry like berries. If they are too j uicy boil it down before 
putting in the fruit. Use half as much sugar as cherries by 
weight Stir often while drying and pack, while hot, in jars, 
with a little sugar sprinkled between the layers. Cover 
closely with paper and keep cool and dark. They may be 
used in place of raisins. Dry currants in the same man- 
ner. 

Dried Peaclies.— Peel yellow peaches, cut them from 
the stone in one piece, allowing two pounds of sugar for six 
pounds of the fruit; make a syrup of the sugar and a 
lii tie water, let it boil, put in the peaches and let them 
cook till they are quite clear, take them up carefully on a 
dish andset them in the sun to dry. Strew powdered sugar 
Qver them on all sides, a little at a time, and if any syrup id

left remove them to fresh dishes. When they are quite dry- 
lay them lightly in a jar with a little sugar between ♦ ach 
layer. They retain the flavor of the fruit better than can- 
ned peaches. 

Dried Plums. — Dry Avith the stones in to preserve 
the full flavor. Where those are objected to stone thf» 
plums and fill the cavities with sugar. Dry like berries on 
plates sifted over with sugar. Turn often and finish in a 
cool oven 

Peach Lieather. —(Table Talk.) Pare a half peck of 
nice yellow peaciitjs, remove the stones, weigh the peaches, 
and to ?ach pound allow a quarter of a pound of granulated 
sugar. Stew them slowly together, mashing and stirring 
to prevent scorching. When they have cooked dry enough 
to spread out in a thick paste, grease a perfectly smooth 
board with butter, spread the peaches all over it in an en- 
tirely smooth thin sheet, stand it in the sun to dry, bring- 
ing it in before the dew falls; if necessary, put it out the 
second day. When this peach marmalade is sufficiently 
dry not to be sticky, roll it up like leather, and keep it in 
a dry place. It will keep perfectly well from one season to 
an3ther. 

When wanted for use cut it in thin slices from the end of 
the roll. 

Quince leather may be made in precisely the same man- 
ner. 

These fruit leathers are popular through Maryland and 
Virginia. They form a pleasant accompaniment to wafers 
or crackers for lunch or tea. 



FRUIT BEVERAGES AND SYRUPS. 

Appleade, No. 1 .—Wash and slice one large or two medi- 
um sized SDur applei for every quart of watir; they should 
neither be peeled nor cored. Put it on the fire in a tin or 



lei FBurrs and how to use them. 

porcelaia saucepan with the watnr, and boil, closely cover- 
ed, until the apple stews to pieces. Strain the liquor at once, 
pressing the apple hard in the cloth. Strain this again 
through aline r bag, and set away to cool. Svveeten with 
white sugar, and ice for drinking. It will keep some time 
if bet in a cool dark place if it is first scalded. 

Appleade, No. 2.— Bake three or four sour apples, mash 
them in a porcelain or stone dish, add half a cup of sugar 
and pour boiling water over them. When cold, strain, and 
add more sugar if needed. 

Appleade, No. 3.— Stir a tablespoonful of apple jelly in- 
to a goblet of cold water. 

Apple Toast Water.— Toa.<t a large slice of bread on 
both sides till it is very brown and crumble into large pieces. 
Mix these with two or three baked apples and over them 
pour a quart of boiling water. Sugar to taste, and when 
cold strain tor a cooling and nutritious beverage. 

Blackberry ade.—xSteep .a quart of blackberries in a 
.quart of water till the fruit is tender, then mash the berries 
and strain out the juice. Sweeten and dilute according to 
the taste. 

Blackberry Cordial.— Wash fresh ripe berries and 
mash them with a wooden spoon or mallet. Strain out the 
juice, and to every four quarts add one quart of boiling 
water. Let it stand in a cool place twenty-four hours, 
stirring occasionally. Strain again, and to every gallon 
of liquid add two heaping pints or two pounds and a half of 
the best white sugar. Stir it well and cork in jugs or seal 
in cans. It is excellent for invalids, especially in summer. 
No alcohol is needed to keep trom fermentation. 

Blackberry Vinegar. —Put a gallon of fresh berries in 
a stone jar, and over them pour one quart of good cider 
vinegar. Cover closelj, and in two weeks strain and pour 
the vinegai* over two quarts fresh berries. At the end of a 
week if it doe» not seem strong enough pour it over two 



MISCEIiLANEOUS. 163 

quarts more. Allow one pound and one half of sugar to 
every quart of vinegar, heat to the boiling point, skim, and 
bottle or seal. 

Cranberryade.—Mash two- thirds of a pint of berries 
in one cup of cold water. Boil one large spoonful of oatmeal 
and a slice of lemon in two quarts of water, add the cran- 
berries and sweeten to taste. Boil half an hour and strain. 

Cherry Cordial.— Crush a pint of cherries, leaving in 
the pits, sweeten to the taste, and over them pour a quart 
of boiling water. Strain and addsugar if needed. All kinds 
of berries and larger fruit may be used in the same manner. 
Cool on the ice. It may be made as rich and strong a*^ de • 
sired. 

Currantade.— Mash a quart of ripe currants, or currants 
and red raspberries mixed, in the proportion of twice as much 
of the former as of the latter fruit, add half as much sugar, 
witlt four quarts of water. Stir thoroughly and press 
through a jelly-bag. It may be made more or less sweet 
at pleasure. This is a gk ol refreshing summer beverage. 
It will keep several days on ice. 

Figr Water.— Boil half a pound of figs with half an 
ounce of ginger in two quarts of water until it is reduced 
to a pulp. Strain and bottle, or use at once. 

FniitTemperance Beverage.— (Dr. M. L. Holbrook.) 
Twelve lemons, one quart ripe raspberries, one pine-apple, 
two pounds best refined sugar and three quarts of pure soft 
cold, not iced, water. Peel the lemons very thin. Squeeze 
the juice over the peel, letitstanvl two hours, add the two 
pounds of refined sugar, mash the raspberries with half a 
pound of the same sugar, peel the pine-apple and cut in 
very thin slices and cover them with sugar. Strain the lem- 
on juice, crush the raspberries, press the pine-apple, put 
the lemon juice in a bowl, add the three quarts of water, 
the lemon juice and pine-apple, stir all together till the sug- 
ar is dissolved, then strain and serve. This makes a deli- 
cious beverage. 



IM FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Fruit Juices*— Heat ah kinds of berries, or red and white 
currants, and mash and strain as in making jelly. Pour 
the juice into a preserving ketde and let it boil. Skim and 
cook fifteen minutes. Then to every quart of juice put 
three-fourths of a teacupful of sugar, after it is heated in 
the oven. Boil ten minutes and seal in cans. Fruit juice is 
excellent in the winter and early spring, not only as a fla- 
voring for beverages but to use in sauces and various kinds 
of cooking. 

Grooseberry Water.— Pour over a pint of green goose- 
berries two quarts of water and add half an ounce of ginger. 
Boil to a pulp, then let it settle, and strain. Sweeten to 
taste. 

Grape Vinegar.— Pulp tl e grapes and throw into a 
stone jar, adding, by measure, a scant third of cider vine- 
gar. Cover closely and stir often. On the fourth day press 
through a cloth, and to the expressed j uice add sugar in the 
proportion of five pounds of good white sugar to every 
three quarts of vinegar. Skim and boil ten minutes, then 
seal whUe hot, like canned fruit A tables poo nful in a 
tumbler of water makes a grateful i ummer drink. 

Grape Juice, No. 1.— One of the best uses to which fruit 
cem be put is in making nature's summer beverage, the 
unfermei ted juice of the grape. Ic is rich, fragrant, in- 
vigorating and nutritious There are special brands in the 
market, but any one having grapes can manufacture his 
own beverage. 

This nnfermented grape juice is recommended by medi- 
cal men as an invaluable and unstimulating tonic. It is 
used for communion purposes, as a substitute for wines at 
festivities, and as a flavoring for blanc-mange, gelatines 
and ice-creams. As it is wholly free from alcohol, grape 
juice is fast growing into popular repute. 

For the preparation of unfermented wine or ^rape juice, 
one of the National Superintendents of the W. C. T. U. 
contributes the following recipe: 



MISCELLANEOUS. 165 

** Select your grapes— not too ripe— then put them into a 
kettle with a little water, and slowly bring them to a scald 
ing heat, stirring them occasionally. 

Then put them into a cheese-cloth bag and drain over 
night Express the juice, and strain through another, 
thicker bag, and add sugar to suit the taste ; then bring to 
aboil, skimming frequently; bottle and cork. The corks 
should be long and perfect, the juice fill the bottles, except 
just space enough to insert the cork at fii-st, to make it air- 
tight; then, as the juice cools, press down the corks so that 
no space is left between the juice and cork, or can the juice 
the same as fruit. If any is left, scald, bottle, and cork a.s 
before. In this manner is made unfermented wine (which 
neither sours nor ferments), for communion purposeb. 

Grape Juice, No. 2. -The grapes should be of the 
best quality. Wash them thoroughly, after strip- 
ping from the stems, and discarding any that are imperfect 
Throw them into a ^ranitized kettle wi*^^h half a pint of 
water to every three quarts of fruit, skim when they begin 
to boil, and cook very slowly for ten minutes. While still 
boiling hot, strain through a jelly- bag, squeezing the skins 
and seeds into a separate receptacle, as the juice from 
them will be apt to be discolored. Return the liquid to 
the preserving kettle, and after boiling half an hour seal in 
heated glass cans like fruit The juice from seeds and 
skins may be bottled separately. It can be safely kept till 
grapes are again ripe, if packed in a cool, daric place. The 
absence of light is as imperative as the absence of heat 
Cooled on ice it makes a delicious and wholesome beverage, 
and is supposed to have specially tonic qualities. 

If grape juice cannot be kept in a very cool placrf, add one 
cup of sugar to every quart of juice at the end of half an 
hour, then boil ten minutes longer. 

Liemonade, No. 1.— Cut three large oi four small juicy 
lemons upon a cupful of white sugar in a porcelain or glass 
pitcher. Bruise it well and stir, then pour over it a quart 
of cold water. It is best to take out the pips. Use boiling 
water for hot lemonade. 



166 PRUltS AKB HOW TO USE THEM. 

Liemonade, No. 2.— Peel fonr lemons, over the peel of 
one pour a pint of boiling water. Make a syrup of one cup- 
ful of sugar and one cupful of water, boil it ten minutes, 
skim, and pour it over the infused lemon peel, squeeze in 
the lemon juice and add more sugar and water as desired. 
Cool on ice. 

Liemonade, No. 3.— Slice four lemons and two oranges, 
and proceed according to lemonade No. I. Then add two 
tablespoonfuls of crushed strawberries, raspberries or 
cherries, and half a dozen slices of pine-appie. Let the 
fruit stand for an hour, then strain. Use only one kind of 
fruit with the lemons, if desired. 

Liemon Tea.— Into fresli steeped black tea drop thinly 
sliced lemon, peel and all except the seeds, in the proportion 
of one slice to t small cupful of tea. With it sugar may be 
used. This is the famous Russian tea concocted in 
samovars, introduced into this country by travelers fresh 
from Russia. 

Liemon Vinegar. —Fill a quart bottle or glass can 
nearly full of cider vinegar, and into it drop the yellow 
rinds of six lemons and the juice of two. In a short time 
the vinegar may be used instead of pure lemon juice. A 
tablespoonful in a glass of water, into which stir a piece of 
soda as large as a pea, produces a glass of foaming lemon 
soda. Use home-made fruit juice as the flavoring. 

Liemon Punch, No. 1.— Grate the yellow rinds of two 
lemons and two oranges over two poundg of lump sugar, 
and squeeze over it the juice of five lemons and two 
oranges. Let it stand till the sugar is dissolved ; it will take 
three or four hours. Beat and mash the sugar. Add the 
stiff beaten whites of four eggs, mix thoroughly, and pour 
over it two and one half pints of ice water. Serve in 
tumblers. 

Liemon Punch, No. 2.— Pare four large or five small 
lemons and peel off the white rind. Take the pulp without 
the seeds, with the thin yellow peel and two teaspoonf uls 



Miscellaneous. ui 

of beat green tea, and steep in one pint of boiling water ten 
minutes, taking care not to let it boil. Strain it and add a 
pound of sugar, over which has been squeezed the juice of 
two more lemons. Pour over another pint of boiling 
water and serve hot. Dilute according to taste. 

Liemon Tincture.— Pare the yellow rind very thin 
when lemons are used, and drop into a jar half lilled with 
grape juice. Seal at oncf . 

lieinon Whey. —Boil as much milk as is required, squeeze 
a lemon, and add as much of the juice to the milk as will 
make it clear. Mix with hot water, and sweeten to taste. 

Liemon Water.— Cut afresh lemon into very thin slices, 
put them in a pitcher, and pour on one pint of boiling 
water. Let it stand till cold, sweeten to tdste, and use. 

Milk Lieinonade to keep a day or two.— Pare 
twenty- four large fresh lemons as thin as i>ossible; put 
eight of the rinds into three quarts of hot but not boiling 
water, and let it stand three hours. Rub fine sugar on 
the rind of the others, to absorb the essence. Put it in a 
china bowl, and squeeze the juice from the lemons over it, 
after which add a pound and a half of fine sugar. Now put 
the water to the above, and add three quarts of boiling 
milk. Mix and pour through a jelly-bag. Use the day 
after made. 

Liemon Syrup.— To every pint of the juice of sound 
fresh lemons, take one pound and one quarter of sugar. 
Heat it, skim, and seal in glass jars. 

Orangeade, No. 1.— Squeeze three oranges upon three 
lablespoonfuls of sugar, add a dash of lemon juice, and fill 
with a pint of water. Orange syrup may be boiled and 
canned for a summer drink precisely like lemon syrup. 

Orangeade, No. 2.— On a heaping pint of sugar pour 
a half pint of water and the beaten whites of two eggs. 



168 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Set it on the stove and let it boil, then strain it« and add a 
tumblerful of orange juice. Cool on the ice. 

Pine-appleade. —Peel and grate, or chop, a fine pine- 
apple and sprinkle it with pulverized sugar. Over it pour 
one quart of boiling water; sweeten to taste. Strain and 
chill on ice. 

Raspberry Syrup.— Mash and strain ripe red rasp- 
berries and make a syrup of a pound of sugar with one 
scant pint of water. Boil fifteen minutes, and to this syrup 
add one pint of berry juice, and simmer slowly, well 
covered, for half an hour. Seal when hot. In the same 
way make currant syrup, and a mixture of currants and 
blackberries, also plum syrup. If syrups are made on a 
damp, muggy day boil half an hour longer. . 

Raspberry Vinegar.— This is made like Blackberry 
vinegar. 

Raspberry Acid.— Mash, strain and sweeten rasp- 
berry juice and dilute with water. Then dissolve four 
ounces of tartaric acid in two quarts of soft water, and 
pour over ten pounds of berries. Strain in forty-eight 
hours, and to every pint of juice add a pint of sugar. 
Bottle for flavoring beverages. 

Raspberry Cordial.— Weigh one pound of berries, 
crush them and stir into them one quart of water, one 
whole lemon sliced and the juice of two oranges or a little 
orange-flower water. Mix, cover, and let it stand two hours, 
then strain and stir in one pint of sugar dissolved in a 
little boiling water. Set on the ice and serve. 

In the same manner prepare cherry, grape, or black- 
berry cordial. 

Strawberry Water.— Crush one pound of ripe straw- 
berries with one half pound of fine sugar and let them 
stand three hours. Then add one cupful of water, the 
juice of one lemon, and strain through a fine sieve. 
Other berries may be similarly prepared, adding more 
sugar if they are very acid. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 169 

Strawberry Syrup.— Make a syrup of one pound of 
sugar and one pint of water, and boil till it will spin a 
thread. Skim beft)re it begins to boil. Add one pint of 
strawberry juice and boil for three-fourths of an hour. 
Seal hot. 

Strawberry Vinegar.— Over four quarts of straw- 
berries pour three quarts of vinegar. Cover, and at the 
end of three days strain, and to each quart of vinegar add 
one pint of white sugar. Let it come to a boil, skim and 
seal. 

Tamarind Water.— Boil two ounces of tamarinds, a 
scant cupful of currants, and one and one half cupfuls of 
raisins in four quarts of water till it is reduced to three 
quarts. Strain and coo). 

Tisane.— (French.) Chop fine a cupful of dried fruit, 
such as figs, dates or prunes, and steep for an hour in one 
quart of water. Strain, sweeten to taste, and use a^ a 
beverage. 

The following recipes are taken from the '* Vegetarian 
Messenger," London, Eng. 

Fresh Fruit Syrups.— 1. Currant Syrup : Take two 
quarts of red currants, mash them, and add one quart of 
water; let them stand till the next day, then run through 
a jelly- bag, and to every pint of juice add one pound of 
loaf sugar. Put into a skillet, or preserving pan, place 
this on the fire, and let it boil gently for twenty minuteg — 
removing all the scum as it rises- and when cold, bottle. 
To make a currant or any other fresh fruit drink, put a 
small wine-glass of the syrup to a tumbler of iced water. In 
ail cases the best fresh fruit, free from stalks, etc., should be 
used, and then crushed with a wooden (not metal) instru- 
ment. All these syrups should be tightly corked when 
bottled. 2. BJ/ick Currant Syrup : To every quart of 
black currants add one pint of water; put on the fire, and 
boil for twenty minutes. Then strain through a jelly- bag, 
and to every pint of juice add one pound of sugar. Again,

boil gently for another twenty minutes, and when cold, 
bottle for u*e. Quantity for syrup as above. 3. 07wi*ry 
Synip : Pick two pounds of Kentish cherries from the 
stalks; put all into a mortar, and pound the fruit, shells, 
and kernels. Add the juice of one lemon, then two quarts 
of water, and boil for twenty minutes; now strain through 
a jelly-b'»g. To every quart of juice add two pounds of 
sugar. Again boil for twenty minutes, and when cold, 
bottle. If the cherries are stoned, then add essence of 
almond. 4. MoreUo Cherry Syrup : This is made the same 
way. 5. Raspberry Syrup : Mash the laspberries, and to 
every quart add one pint of water. Let them remain till 
the next day ; then run through the bag, and to every pint 
of juice add one pound and three-quarters of sugar. Boil 
for twenty minutes, and when cold, bottle. 6. Strawberry 
Syrup : This is done the same way. 7. Raspib crry or Strawberry 
Syrup (another way); Take two quarts of fresh, ripe rasp- 
berries or strawberries, five pounds of powdered loaf sugar, 
and add two pints and a half of water. Spread the 
powdered sugar over the fruit, and let it stand for four or 
five hours, then express thB juice, strain, put on the fire to 
rise t<: boiling point, and again strain. When cold, bottle. 
8. Ra^erry or Strawberry Syrup (another way): Mash the 
fresh fruit, express and strain the juice, and to every quart

CANNED FRUIT. 

Every year ^vitnesses the growth of the fruit-canning 
industry, as well as the increase in the use of fruit in all 
ways. The process of sealing up cooked fruit in air-tight 
jars might be thought to be simple enough, but, like every 
other process of cooking, there is one right and many 
wrong ways. If worth doing at all it is worth doing in 
such a manner as to preserve the fine fresh flavor and keep 
the fruit whole and attractive in appearance. 

In the first place, can good fruit or none. No small, un- 
ripe, gnarly bearings should be sealed up for the winter's 
use. The fruit should be ripe but not overripe, fresh 
picked and cooked with very little sugar. 

In the second place, select glass cans, each having a por- 
celain-lined or glass cover which fits it perfectly. The 
rubbers should be fitted also, and those rejected which 
have become hard or stretched. They should be rinsed 
in warm, not hot, water, which toughens them. Before 
beginning to can: have each cover fitted to its jar and all 
well washed and sweet. Pint jars are best in a small fam- 
ily. If each jar is scalded when emptied and the cover 
washed and screwed on, it will be easy to begin the process 
of canning. 



172 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Small fruits ought to be picked in the morning while it 
is still fresh and cool, and the sooner they are cooked and 
in jars the better. A careful picking over and rejection 
of any that are unripe or inferior is presupposed. Id 
preparing large fruits use a silver knife, or if that is incon- 
venient, drop the cut fruit into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloration. 

Stew the fruit in a porcelain or granite kettle, using as 
little water as possible, and cook it very slowly. Hard 
boiling dissipates the delicate flavor, rapid boiling reduces 
it to a shapeless mass, yet boil it must or it will be sure 
to ferment. 

Where time will allow it is a good plan to pack the fruit 
in the jars in which it is to be sealed before it is cooked. 
Fill them to the top and set in a large kettle with wooden 
slats nailed across each other to make a flat bottom. Cot- 
ton cloth or muffin rings answer the same purpose, but 
tho false bottom is safer and more cx)nvenient. Over the 
cans fold a clean towel and let them steam until the fruit 
is soft. If it is to be sealed without sugar till up each 
can from one heated for that purpose, take it out with a 
cloth to a table adjacent, and screw on the top wtich must 
be kept hot ui a pan of hot water. In fact everything about 
the fruit must be kept hot. If there a)*e bubbles of ah' in 
the jar, run down a silver spoon and let them escape. Fill to 
the very brim, screw the top on to the utmost extent, and 
invert the jar on a tray or table in a cooler place. If there 
is leakage it can be detected at once. 

The length of time required for cooking is as follows : 

Cherries and huckleberries, five minutes. All kinds of 
berries, grapes, and currants, six to eight minutes. Sliced 
or halved peaches and goosebemes, ten minutes. Halved 
pears, quince, sliced pine-apple, whole peaches, twenty min-

utes. Strawberries are an exception to other berries and 
leqiiii'e to be cooked fifteen minutes, and crab-ap|)le and 
whole pears half an hour. The time for apples depends 
on the vaidety: they should be put up when tender. Ap- 
ples are excellent for winter use, either for pies, or better, 
plain sauce. Canned without sugar they are a welcome 
change from lorries in the early spring, and are much su- 
perior to the acid, unripe fruit brought from the far 
south. 

In regard to the use of S-igar every housekeeper will con- 
sult her own taste. Some families reject food that is not 
oversweet like confections, others use less sugar. When 
sugar is used in canning it is better to heat it in the oven, 
frequently stirring to prevent burning, and turn it in just 
Irefore the fruit is pom ed into the cans. Two tablespoon- 
fuls to a quart of berries, peaches, pears and apples should 
l:e sufficient. CuiTants, plums, and cherries require two 
or three times as much. Susanna Dodd, M. D., who has 
given much attention to the preparation of fruits, gives the 
following table of proportions for stewed or canned fruit 
aud fruit juices: also the proportions of water and sugar, 
by measure, for the diflferent kinds of fruit.

The secret of successful caaning is to have jars with 
well-fitting covers, to keep everything hot, to fill the jars 
as full as they will iiold, and seal them without a moment's 
delay. It is absolutely necessary that they should l^ as 
free from air as possible. Cook lt»ut little fruit at a time. 
"Where stationary tubs are in the kitchen it is very conven- 
ient to keep the jars immersed in hot wat^r in them. 
Lift them out, one by one, to the top of the adjoining sta- 
tionary tub, on which stands an ohl tray containing a hot 
plate where each jar is to rest while filling. If any juice 
is spilled it can be returned to the preserving kettle wh'ch 
should be on the left. An attendant taking each jar as it 
is filled, wipes off the drippings from the top, screws on the 
cover and inverts it upon a table. 

There should be no metal used in canning, either in ket- 
tles, spoons, or ladles. Wooden spoon?, porcelain ladles, 
a silver fork and spoon, plenty of soft, clean cloths, and 
much patience and watchfulness are needed. 

In a few hours take lip the jars and give another twist 
to the tops. As they cool, contraction follows.

as to be easily deciphered in the semi-darkness. Fasten 
on the side with flour-paste. A few drops of glycerine in 
a half cupful will prevent them froia falling off when the 
paste dries. It is also useful to put in paste which se- 
cures the paper covers of jelly, marmalade and preserves. 
All kinds of canned and preserved fruit require dark- 
ness. Something in the light rays tends to fermentation 
and granulation. If it be not dark enough cover each jar 
with paper. If there is nn cool cellar, it is a good plan to 
pack jai-s of canned fridt in boxes, fill the interstices with 
paper or sawdust and bury them deep enough to be below 
the reach of frost. Fruit properly canned, that is, well- 
cooked and air-tight, sometimes sours if kept in a warm 
closet. Fruit that is stale, decaying or speckled, will not 
remain sweet. 

Canned Apples.--Stew the fruit and strain as for apple- 
sauce, but ioave it unsweetened. Reheat it in the filled jars 
as described, see that no air bubbles are left in them and 
seal at once. Or peel, core and cut into eighths, stew in a 
preserving kettle till tender but not broken, sweeten to 
ta^te, fill the jars aud seal. Apples canned according ix> the 
first process will be found expecially agreeable in the late 
spring, after uncooked apples have lost their freshness. 

Canned Blackberries.— Make a syrup of one cup of 
suf?ar and one cup of water for each quart of berries, heat, 
skim, and let it come to a boil. Drop in the fruit and 
let it boil eigbt minutes, then fill the hot cans and seal 
If the b^rrie^ are heated in the cans, pour over them the 
syrup just below the boiling point, after the filled jars are 
placed upon the wooden rack in the kettle of hot water, 
and heat gradually. Boil the fruit five minutes, take out the 
jars one by one, and seal. 

Canned Cherries.— Use the sour cherries for canning. 



176 FKUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

or the white, which are less rich but require less sugar and 
preserve their whiteness after being cooked. Poi common 
use many prefer to put up cherries without pitting them, but 
for obvious reasons it is not the nicest way of preparing 
them. There are now sold machines fv)r pitting which re- 
duces that labor to a minimum. Make a syrup ol three- 
fourths of a pint of sugar to one cup of water for every two 
pounds of pitted cherries and juice, skim, throw in the fruit 
and boil &ve minutes. As there is n:) shape to retain it is 
not needful to cook the fruit in the jars. With every can- 
ful boil one tablespoonful of pits, tied loosely in a muslin 
bag, which may be taken out before the fruit is poured into 
the jars. 

To can white cherries select the largest and prick each 
once or twice with a coarse needle and put it in a glass jar. 
Place the jars upon the rack in hot water and fill them with 
boilingsyrup, made a trifle less sweet than for sour red cher- 
ries, let it boil five minutes and then seal. 

Canned Currants.— Add a large cupful of water to 
every two quarts of fruit and simmer till they are soft; it is 
impossible to keep them whole. Then add one cupful of 
sugar and simmer again and sealT The flavor is milder and 
more agreeable by adding to the currants one-fourth or 
even more of their measure of ra»p berries. 

Canned Peaches.— Peel the fruit and throw into cold 
water. Make a syrup of one pint of sugar and one quart of 
water to every four pounds of fruit and let it come to a hard 
boil. Meantime cook the peaches In enough water to cover 
them till they are tender, skim them out, and without break- 
ing, drop thf m in the boiling syrup. Let them come to a 
boil and seal in jars. 

Canned Pears.— Proceed as directed for peaches, but 
use less suerar if they are very swee"- 

Canned Plums. —Allow half a pound of sugar to every 
pound of sour plums, and prick the skins of greengage 
plums each several times, before cooking. Make a syrup. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 177 

bring to the boiling point slowly, skixn, cook the plums, and 
can when tender. 

Canned Pine-apple.— ^Peel the fruit, cut out the eyes, 
and holding the stem with a cloth wrapped about it, with 
the left hand, pick it to pieces with a silver fork leaving the 
core on the stem. To every pound of pine-apple allow ten 
ounces of sugar, and cook from t-en to fifteen minutes before 
canning. The fru't should cook clear and translucent 

Canned Qainces.— Wash the quinces, cnt out all defects 
and save peelings and corings for jelly. Make a syrup of 
one pound of sugar and one quart of water for every five 
pounds of fruit, into w^iich skim the quince slices, rings or 
eighths which have been strewed till tender in water. Let 
it come to a boil, then seal in hot cans. 

Canned Raspberries* — Steam them in the jars as here- 
tofore described, without adding either water or sugar, 
which may be added to taste when the fruit is used. Or, 
and it is a much quicker method, cook and sweeten as in 
preparing currants , using less sugar. Again, make a syrup 
as given in canning blackberries. 

Canned Strawberries.—As soon as the fruit is picked, 
wash it and remove the hulls. Place a layer of the fruit in 
a stone jar and sprinkle over it a handful of sugir. 
Over that place another layer and more sugar, just enough 
to make them fit for table use. Do not mash or stir them, 
but at the end of four hours the sugar will have drawn the 
juice from the fruit. Pour off the juice into the preserving 
kettle, to every quart add^ a quarter of a cupful of water 
and let it come to a boil. Drop in the drained strawberries 
and let them scald two minutes, then gently lift them out 
with a strainer, into cans standing in hot water. The jars 
ought to be only two- thirds full and must be immediately 
filled with the hot ^yrup and sealed. This method preser ves 
the fresh flavor of the fruit better than when it is boiled a 
longer time. If the syrup seems very thin cook ten min- 
utes before pouring over the berries, which must be kept 
hot 



178 PBUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 



PEESEKVED FETJITS. 

Preserves are a rich preparation of fruit which is cooke3 
with an equal weight of sugar. Happily this old-timo 
toothsome confection has given way to mere wholesome 
canned fruit, but now and then the housekeeper wishes to 
put up a few jars of preserves m honor of the olden time 
when the measure of a woman's efficiency in cooMng i»ar- 
tially rested upon her sweets. The less they are used the 
better. Occasionally a small portion in garnishing or fla- 
voring or in fancy dishes upon extra occasions may be ad- 
missible. 

In preserving, the fruit will remain whole by making a 
hot syrup by the addition of a very little water to the sugar 
and allowing it to come to a boil. Then add the fruit, 
which should simmer gently until it is soft enough to allow 
a straw to penetrate it. Large fruits like peaches, pears 
and quinces are peeled, pitted and often divided in half. 
Small fruits are plunged directly into the boiling syrup, 
and when thoroughly cooked are skimmed out carefully so 
as not to break them. The s^Tupisthe'i boiled down and 
poured over the conserve. If it is not very thick it is 
drained off in a day or two, boiled again and poui^ed over 
the fruit. This is sometimes repeated three or four times. 

Apple Preserve^.— Make a syrup of one quart of sugar 
and two quart;S of water, skim and boil. Pare, core and 
divide into quarters or eighths, according to their size, 
fine, tart apples, allowing one pound of fruit to a half 
pound of syrup, and drop the secuons into Qold water. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 179 

Take them out and drop into the syrup, which must 
simmer gently, a few at a rime. Cook till tender, skim out 
into jars kept, in hot water, and drop more apples into the 
syrup. When the jars are two-thirds full, fill with hot 
syrup and seal like canned fruit. Flavor with lemon slices 
if desired. This makes a fine and not too rich preserve. 

Apple Preserves.— (Entire.) Take medium sized tart 
apples, peel and core from the blossom end, leaving the 
stem ; cook as above and seal m stone or glass. Crab- 
apples are preserved entire, without peeling. Make the 
syrup much richer by using one quart and one half of sugar 
to one quart of water. Prick the crab-apples before boil- 
ing. 

Apple lieiuon Preserves.— Pare and quarter sweet 
apples and proceed as above. To each quart of fruit allow 
two lemons cut in thin slices and cooked in the syrup. 
Discard the seeds. 

Apple Ginger Preserves.— Peel, core and cut the 
apples or chop them coarsely. To every pDund of fruit 
allow an ounce of green ginger cut into fine pieces, and 
three-fourths of a pound of sugar. Stew the apple in a 
little water till it begins to be tender, drain and turn into 
the syrup in which the ginger has steeped. Let it come to 
a boil and it is done. By using a Uttle more ginger and 
tying it in a thin musUn bag, it may be fiavored without 
serving the ginger with the apple. The amount can be 
varied to suit the taste. 

Green Apple Preserves.— (Shirley Dare.) Gather 
your apples when they are the size of a walnut, with the 
stalks and a leaf or two on; put a handful of vine leaves 
into a preserving pan, then a layer of apples, then vine 
leaves and then apples, till it is full, and vine leaves pretty 
thick at the top, and fill it with spring watt3r; cover closely 
to keep in the steam, and set it on a slow fire till they 
grow soft, then take them out and take off the skins, and 
put them in the same water again with the vine leaves, 



180 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

which must be quite c old, or it will make them crack. Put 
in a lirtle rock-alum (a dessertspoonful to a twelve-quart 
kettle), and set them over a slow fire till they are green, 
then take them out and lay them on a sieve to drain. 
Make a j?ood syrup, and give them a gentle boil for three days 
(t. e.y once a day), then put them in small jars, with 
brandied paper over them, and tie them down tight. 

Barberry Preserves.— Pick the barberries free from 
stems, wash them, and for every quart take a little more 
than one pint of good molasses. Let it come to a boil, then 
drop in the barberries and cook thrne-quarters of an hour. 
When done they will be clear. Seal in jars. Some persons 
are so fond of the flavor of the barberry that nothing quite 
takes its place. 

Blackberry Preserves.— Allow three-fourths of a 
pound of r;ugar for overy pound of fruit which is to be 
simmered in clear water till it is thoroughly cooked. Allow 
a teacupful of water to a quart of berries. Then throw in 
the sugar, boil up, skim and seal in cans. 

Cherry Preserves. — Stone the cherries, reserving 
every drop of juice. Weigh the fruit, allowing pound for 
pound of sugar. Put a layer of fruit for one of sugar until 
all is used up; pour over the juice and boil gently until the 
syrup begins to thicken. The short-stemmed red cherries 
or the morellos are best for preserves. 

Fig Preserves.— Take green figs, hardly ripe, and soak 
two hours in lemon juice and water, half and half, or 
vinegar and water. Make a syrup of one pint of sugar and 
half a cup of water to each pound of fruit, boil and skim. 
Into it drop the drained figs and simmer till they are 
tender. Skim them out and if the syrup is not thick boil 
until it thickens. The last thing add the juice of one 
lemon to every three pounds of fruit and turn over the tigs 
which have been kept hot in jars. Seal at once. 

Ouava Jelly.— (Southern Preserve.) Pare and quarter 
ripe guavas and drop the sections into cold water* Put 



MISCELLANEOUS. 181 

them into water enough to nearly cover them and simmer 
tilltliey are tender, then strain through linen, without 
pressing the fruit, hanging up the bags so they will drip 
all night. When all the j nice has drained out boil it, un- 
covered, so it will evaporate readily; skim, and atthe ondof 
an hour add white su^ar in the proportion of a scant pint 
to one pint of juice. Continue to let it simmer till the jelly is 
clear, then add lime-juice, to taste- Simmer half an hour 
longer, skimming often, then pour into jara of glass or 
stone and cover when cold. 

Mango Jelly is made like the guava except that the 
mangoes are peeled, stoned and thrown into a very weak 
solution of lemon or lime-juice before cooking them. 

Preserved Citron Meion, No. l.Cut the melon in 
oblong strips, remove the skin and the soft pulp. Boil in 
water containing an ounce of alum to a gallon of water, 
and drain when tender. Make a syrup out of a cupful of 
water to a pound of sugar, boil up and clarify. This 
quantity of syrup will be sufficient for a pound of melon: 
add to it two sliced lemons. Immerse the citron in the 
boiling syrup, let it boil five minutes, and than seal in jars. 

Citron Preserves, No. 2.— Peel and cut the citron in 
pieces an inch square; then boil in water until soft; drain 
off the water and add one pound of sugar to each pound of 
citron ; to every five pounds of the preserve add one pound 
of raisins, one lemon sliced, half an ounce of whole cloves, 
and one ounce of stick cinnamon; dissolve the sugar, and 
when hot add the fruit, and simmer slowly for two hours. 

Currant Preserves.— Take equal weights of sugar and 
fruit: make a syrup of tl o former with a very little water, 
and drop in the ripe fruit. Boil fifteen minutes, and seal in 
stone jars or glass cans. 

Huckleberry Preserves.— Nearly fill jars of stone or 
glass with huckleberries, and fill them up with good 
molasses. Cover and set away. They are good for wlater 
use. 



1«8 PETJITS AKD HOW TO USE THGM. 

Orange Preserves.— Take any number of oranges, 
with rather moro than their weight in white sugar. Slight- 
ly grate thf* oranges and tcore them round with a knife, but 
do not cut deep. Put them in cold wat^r for three days* 
changing the water two or three times a day. Tie them 
up in a cloth, and boil until they are soft enough for a pin to 
penetrate the skin. While they are boiling place the sugar 
on the fire, with rather more than half a pint of water to 
each pound; let it boil for a minute or two, then strain it 
through muslin. Put the oranges into the syrup till it jel- 
lies and is of a yellow color. Try tiie syrup by putting some 
to cool. It must not be too stiff. The syrup need not cover 
the oranges but they must be turned, so that each pai t gets 
thoroughly done. 

Preserved Orange Peel.— Weigh the oranges whole 
and allow pound for pound. Peel the oranges neatly, and 
cut the rind into narrow shreds. Boil until tender, chang- 
ing the water twice, and replenishing with hot water from 
the kettle. Squ^^eze the strained juice of the oranges over 
the sugar, let this heat to a boil, put in th e shreds and boil 
twenty minutes. 

Orange and Rhubarb Preserves.— Peel six large, 
nice, thin skinned oranges, taking off all the white rind, 
and slice the oranges into a i^orcelain kettle. Take out; all 
the pits and cut, half of the yellow rind into small pieces and 
put with it. Add two pounds of rhubarb stalks cut iuio 
small pieces, a teacupful of water and three and a half cup- 
fuls of sugar. Boil till the rhubarb is soft, and seal. 

Peach Preserves, No. l.-Pare the fruit and to each 
pound add one pint of sugar. Make a syrup with one cup 
of water to a pound of fruit-, and wlien it boils drop in the 
entire peaches. Simmer till they are tender, and peal: 
Half a dozen kernels cooked with each pound of fruit im- 
proves the flavor. 

Peach Preserves, No. 2.— Peel, and remove the pits, 
allow pound for pound and put fruit and sugar in layers in 



MlS0]fiLLANfiOTO. 18^ 

a stone jar. On the second day drain them through a 
colander or coarse sieve, boil up the syrup, skim and turn 
over the peaches. Repeat this three days, then seal. The 
flavor is better than when the fruit is cooked. 

Pears Preserved Whole, No. 1.— Take pears when 
not too ripe, and set them over the fire in a sufficient 
quantity of cold Wciter, letting them simmer, but not 
lK)il. When they are softened, take them out, peel them 
carefully, prick them with a pin, and put them on again in 
fresh water, with the juice of a lemon; let them boil rapidly, 
and when they are sufficiently done so that a pin will pass 
readily through them without the least resistance, take 
them out and put them into cold water. In the meantime 
have ready some hot thick syrup, and having well drained 
the pears, pour it over them. Let them stand for twency- 
f our hours, and then give them a gentle boil. Take them 
again out of the syrup and dip them in cold water, after 
which pour hot syrup upon them, and when they have stood 
three days" give them another boil; when cold, take them out 
drain them, and put them into bottles, then thicken the 
syrup by a few boilings, and pour over them. Pears peeled 
and cored are preserved like apples. 

Preserved Pears, No. 2.— Peel three pounds of pears 
and place them in a stew-jmn; cover them with water, and 
let them stew two hours. Take them out and put them in 
a brown jar with three fourths of a pound of loaf sugar ^ 
and two tables poonfuls of the water they were stewed in to 
each pound. Add a little candied lemon, cut in small 
pieces, or a few cloves, if preferred. Place the cover on the 
jar, and stew them in an oven for two hours. 

Pine-apple Preserves, No. 1.— Pare, cut in sUces, 
core, and weigh the fruit, allowing pound for pound of 
sugar and fruit. Put in alternate layers in the kettle and 
pour in water, alloAving half a teacupful to each pound of sug- 
ar. Heat to a boil. Take the slices out and spread upon 
dishes in the sun. Boil the syrup half an hour, skimming 



184 FRUITS AKD flOW TO USE THEM. 

it carefully. Put the pine-apple again in the kettle and boii 
fifteen minutes, then take out and pack in wide-inouthed « 
jara. 

Pine-apple Preserves, No. 2.— Peel the pine-apple, 
and pick into bmall bits with a silver fork. To every pound 
allow three -fourths as much sugar. Let it stand overnight, 
and in the morning boil slowly ten or twelve minutes, then 
seal. 

Pine-apple Preserves, No. 3.— Pare the pine -apple 
an<^ remove every particle of skin or eyes, and slice thin. 
To every pound of prepared fruit take a heaping pint of 
sugar. In a large glass jar put a thick layer of dry sugar, 
then a layer of the sliced fruit, and so continue to do till 
the jar is full, leaving a thick layer of sugar last of all. 
Cover closely with several layers of thin paper pasted tight- 
ly on, or with bladder to keep out the air. If kept very coul 
and dark it will not ferment, but have the flavor of the fresh 
fruit. 

Plum Preserves. —Make a syrup of clean, brown sugar 
and clarify it; when perfectly clear and boiling hot, pour it 
over the plums. Let them remain in the syrup two days, 
then drain it off; make it boiling hot, skim it, and pour it 
over again; let them remain another day or two, then put 
them in a preserving kettle over the fire, and simmer gen- 
tly until the syrup is redu«».ed, and thick or lich. Use one 
pouiid of sugar to each pound of plums. 

Quince Preserves, Orange Flavor.— Peel and core 
the quinces and to every quart of the fruit allow two oran- 
ges tliinly sliced. Mix these together and steam till tender, 
while the cores and skins are simmering in enough water 
to cover them. Cook about two hours, or until the water 
thickens to a jelly, then strain and throw into it a pound 
of sugar for every pound of the peeled and cored fruit. 
Boil together to a syrup, and then drop into it the softened 
quarters of quince, which, however, should not be soft 
enough to drop to pieces. Lei thorn simmer, not boil, over 



MISCELLANEOUS. 185 

a slow fire for an hour, when they may be sealed in cans. 
If preferred lemon may be used in place of orange, in which 
case take one lemon to two quarts of fruit 

Quince Preserves, No. 2.— Peel, core and weigh, us- 
ing only large quinces, and making the eighths of the fruit 
as exact and even as possible. Extract the gelatine from 
cores and peelings by stewing them in water several hours. 
Simmer the eighths in a little water till they are tender, 
then skim them out and pour into the kettle with the wa- 
ter in which they have been cooked the gelatinous liquor 
of the strained stems and cores. Throw into it half the 
weight of sugar as of quinces, let it come to a boil, drop in 
the quinces, let it boil again, and seal. 

Raisin Preserves.~(Catharine Owen.) Peel and quar- 
ter a dozen large apples. Put them over a slow fire with a 
cupful of cider and a pound of sugar. When they are ten- 
der stone five pounds of fine pulpy Valencia raisins with 
water enough to prevent burning. Lt^t them cook slowly 
till they are dissolved and stiff. Beat the whole through a 
colander and then through a sieve and pack in small jars. 
When about to use it, cut in thin slices and dust each with 
Confectioners' sugar. This is delicious eaten with cream- 
Strawberry Preserves.— (Wiesbaden Style.) With five 
quarts of good, firm berries, procure also three or four 
boxes of softer fruit, which is to be hulled and spread out on 
a flat dish in order to draw out all the juice. Weigh out 
five pounds of broken loaf sugar, and scatter over this sof fc 
fruit and let it stand several hours. In the morning, or 
whenever all the juice seems expressed, squeeze the fruit 
through a jelly-bag and pour it into a preserving kettle, in- 
to which throw about three pounds more of loaf sugar. 
The exact quantity can be found by measuring the juice 
and the hulled, firm berries, which should be whole, large 
and sound, still kee[)ing them separate, and allowing a 
pound of sugar to a pint of fruit and Juice. Hoil the fruit 
juice and sugar, skimming as it begins to bubble, and then 
gently slide in the berries; they will chock it juFt enough to 



186 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM 

prevent them trom hardening, while the bailing syrup will 
have the tendency to keep the juice within ihv3 berries. 
Simmer for thirty minutes, from the time the fruit is add- 
ed, removing the scum fiom the top when necessary, and 
pour into wide-mouthed bottles with a teaspoonful of olive 
oil on the top. When carefully made these preserves equa' 
the best imported fruit. The berries must be selected 
from the firmest fruit in market. 

Preserved Water-Melon Rind.— Peel the rind after 
cutting it into oblong or fancy shapes, and throw it into a 
porcelain kettle or stone jar. Pill it up with cold water to 
extract the juice, and to every pound of fruit allow one 
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of powdered alum. 
J^et the rind remain in the water three hours, then drain 
and pour over cold water, and let it stand three hours long- 
er. At the end of that time simmer the rind in clear water 
till it begins to look clear. Drain and make a syrup of 
pound for pound or a little less sugar, and a cupful of wa- 
ter for every two pounds of sugar, and add a little green 
ginger cut in small bits. Skim, drop in the rinds, and let. it 
heat through slowly, then simmer till they are clear and ten- 
der though not broken. Skim the preserves into hot glass 
jars, boil down the syrup if it is not sufficiently thick, add 
enough leftion juice to give a distinct flavor, pour over the 
preserve and seal. If the rinds are too soft they may be 
spread on plates in the ovon before putting in the jars. 
Ube orange peel and juice in place of lemon if desired. 

Tutti Frutti Preserves.— This is made ^x)und for 
I>ound of sugar, of every variety of fruit, beginning with 
strawberries. It is to be weighed, boiled and skimmed 
like any other preserve, and each, when cooked, is turned 
into the omnium-gatherum, a stone jar closely covered 
and kept in a cool place Some housekeepers insist that it 
cannot be kept without brandy unless it is sealed after 
adding each variety of fruit Hard fruit like pine-apples, 
quinces and pears must b*^ parboiled till tender before add- 
ing the sugar. Lemon and orange juice are used instead 
of the pulp, but the grated yellow rind is necessary. 



mSCELLANEOUS. 187 

I toned raisins and cocoanut, currants and berries, cherries 
and plums, peaches a.nd pears, all are welcome in a pre- 
serve which has little to recommend it but oddity. 



HOW TO KEEP JELLY AND PRESERVES. 

When jelly is cold and firm, cut a ro.ind of white paper 
to'fil the top of the glass, and dip it in the beatea white 
of aD egg. Press it down close to the jelly ; if it lines the 
Bide of the glass an eighth of an inch, it will do no harm. 
Over this place a layer of smooth white cotton batting, 
fitting it closely to the glass. Absorbent cotton is best, 
but common cotton batting will do if the jelly i» firm. 
Over all paste a round of paper, or paper dipped in white 
of egg. Be sure the jelly is stored where mice cannot nib- 
ble the paper and eat the jelly. 

Again, pour over the jelly a layer of melted paraffine, 
melted, but not hot, just warm enough to run. It will 
harden rapidly. Then paste over the glass a round of soft 
paper. When the jelly is used, melt the paraffine and 
save till the following year. 

For preserves, put up in open-mouthed jars, see that they 
are full, then put over the preserve egg paper and then ab- 
Borbent or common cotton batting. Melt together one 
part mutton taUow and two parts of bees-wax. Dip a clean 
white cloth in the mixture and spread it quickly over the 
mouth of the jar. 

Cotton batting spread over the top (f canned fruit and 
under the cover will prevent mold. Be careful to see 
that it is not caught in the screws of the cover. 

Preserves keep best in a store-room both cool and dry. 
They may be simply tied or sealed with paste where ver- 



188 . PEUITS AND HOW TO IBH, THEM. 

min will not attack them, and each jar will have its appro- 
priate label. It is necessary, thea, that they should be 
placed where they will be secure from -vermin. But it U 
better to have them in glass and covered like canned 
fruit. 

Where paste is used, a few drops of glycerine in each 
ounce will prevent the label from curling np or dropping 
ojff. It is equally efficacious for mucilage. 



CANDIED FKUITS. 

Candied fruits, put up with that artistic taste peculiar 
to the nation, are yearly exported from France in largely 
increasing quantities. In compaiison with the deft work 
of the Gallic confectioner, the candied fruit of the Pacific 
coast is still lacking in those qualities which please the 
eye, but every year shows improvemeiit in this respect 
over the prece^ling. It only needs the skill which comes 
from practice to supercede the foreign with the domestic 
article. 

Among fruits preserved by the process of candying are 
mainly, cherries, pears, apricots, plums, peaches, pine-ap- 
ples, figs, citrons, oranges, melons, and lemons. C. B. 
Mason, Esq. , formerly XJnite»i States Consul at the port of 
Marseilles, has given a report of the method of crystalliza- 
tion peculiar to South-eastern Fraace, of which the f'jllow- 
ing is a condensation : It may be premised that the ex- 
port of candied fruits from France finds a direct market, 
not only in this country and in England, but in Algiers, 
the East and West Indies, and even South America, those 
countries whti-e fresh fruit, ripening every d&y in the year,

would seem to preclude the desirability of its preservation. 
Mr. Mason says : 

" The fruit is first carefully assorted in respect to size end 
uniform degrees of ripeness. Pears, pine-apples, and 
quinces are pared, citrons are cut in quarters and soaked 
in s<-a-water, and the pits of apricots, cherriess and 
peaches are carefully removed. The stone must be re- 
moved witb as little injury as possible to the form and so- 
lidity of the fruit. 

" Thus prepared, the fruit is immersed in boiling water, 
which quickly penetrates the pulp, dissolving and diluting 
the juice, which is thereby nearly eliminated, when the 
fi-uit is subsequently taken from the water and drained, 
leaving only the solid portion of the pulp intact. 

" The process of " blanching" must also be done with exact 
nicety. If immersed too long, the pulp is either over- 
looked or is left too dry and woody. If taken out too 
soon, the juices left in the pulp prevent perfect absorption 
of the sugar afterward, and by eventually causing fermen- 
tation ilestroy the value of the product. In this, as in 
other stages of the process, the only guide is experience. 

" After being thus scalded, soTie fruits, apricots, for ex- 
ample, are again assorted into two or three classes, accord- 
ing to the degree of softness that has been produced, for 
the reason that if kept together they would take up the 
sugar differently, some losing their form entirely, while 
othei-s would remain sufficiently impregnated. For these 
different graties sugar sjTups of different degrees of densi- 
ty are required, the softer the fruit the stronger the syrup 
required for its preservation. 

" For the same reason each of these different varieties of 
fruit requires a sjTup of corresponding strength. 

"Pears, citrons and pine-apples, which remain bwa and

firm, take best a syrup having a density of 18 to 25 degrees, 
while apricots, plums and figs are treated with syrupy 
which gauge from 30 to 40 (^egrees by the aerometer. 

" The requisite syrup having been prepared by diBsolving 
the sugar in pure water, the fruit is immersed in it and 
left at rest for a certain period in large earthenware pans, 
glazed inside, and having a capacity of about eight gallons. 

** The syrup penetrates the pulp and gradually withdraws 
and replaces the remaining fruity juice, which, as it exudes 
and mingles with the transparent liquid, produces a cer- 
tain filmy or clouded appearance, which marks the com- 
mencement of fermentation. When this has reached a 
cej'tain stage, the vessel containing the syrup and fruit is 
placed over the fii'e and heated to 212 degrees F. This 
corrects the fermentation, and raises all impurities to the 
surface, whence, if necessary, they can be removed by 
skimming. K the syrup is of proper density, this process 
of impregnating the fruit with sugar will be complete in 
about six weeks, during which time it is usually necessary 
to perform this heating process, as above described, three 
times. 

" The impregnation of the fruit with sugar being thus 
complete, it is taken out, washed in pure water to remove 
the flaky particles that adhere, and is submitted to one or 
two finishing processes, as follows : 

" If the fruit is to be " glazed," that is, covered with ice 
or transparent coating, it is dipped in a thick, viscid syrup 
of sugar and left to dry and harden rapidly in- the open 
air. If it is to be "crystallized" it is dipped into the 
same syrup, but is then cooled and dried slowly in a kiln 
or chamber warmed to a temperature of ninety degrees, 
Fahrenheit. 

" This slow cooling causes the thick syrup with which the 



MISCELLANEOUS. M 

fruit is covered to crystallize and assume the usual granu- 
lated appearance. The work is now finished. If proper- 
ly done, the fruit thus preserved will bear transportation 
to any climate, and will keep, firm and unciiaoged, for 
years. It is packed in light wooden or card-board boxes, 
and may be shipped in cases containing several hundred 
pounds each. " 

Mr. Mason proceeds to say that the syrup in which the 
fruit is immersed gradually deteriorates by losing sugar 
and absorbing juices. It is then utilizedin making pastss 
or confections, which are simply the soft, uncooked and ir- 
regular shaped pieces of fruits of all kinds minghsd togeth- 
er into a jam in the spent syrup, which is boiled dt>wn to 
the proper consistency. This may either be sealed in 
glasses or dried in pastes, cut into cubes and dusted with 
powdered sugar. 

Candied or Cystallized Fruit or Nuts.— (Mrs Camp- 
bell.) Bo.l one cup of granulated sugar and one cup boil- 
ing water for half an hour. Dip the point of a skimmer 
into the syrup and then into cold water. If the thread 
formed breaks off brittle the syrup is ready. The syrup 
must never be stirred but must boil slowly. When done 
set the saucex>au in boiling water or pour the syrup into a 
bowl placed in hot water to keep the syrup from candying. 
Take the prepared fruit or nuts on the point of a large 
needle or fine skimmer, dip them into the syrap and then 
lay them on a dish, which has been lightly buttered or 
oiled, or string them on a thread, and after dipping in the 
syrup suspend them by the thread. When oranges are used 
divide them into eighths and wipe off all moisture. 

Candied Fruit, No. 2.— Peel small pears or peaches 
but leave in cores and pits, and boil till tender in a syrup 
madeof one pint of sugar and one teacupful of water. I<et 
the fruit stand In the syrup three days, drain, sprinkle 
with pulverized su^r and dry in a cool oven. 



192 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Candied Fruit Pastes.— Over a slow fire boil the juice 
of peiehes, pears, and quinces, or apples and quinces, un- 
til it becomes a thick jelly. Then dry in a slow oven in 
shallow dishes, sprinkling in a little crushed sugar, until 
it becomes a thick paste. Pack in tumblers and cover 
with paper dipped in white of egg. It will keep for years. 

Frosted Fruit.— Dip fine bunches of rip« currants, one 
at a time, into the beaten white of an egg, fully moistening 
the surface of each globe. Then roll the hunches in 
powdered.sugar so that every part will be covered, and lay 
them carefully on white paper «pread overall inverted 
sieve. Dry in a very cool oven. Cherries may be similarly 
prepared if the stems are left attached. Plums and grapes 
may be dipped in the egg and placed upon the paper before 
sifting sugar over them. They make a pleasing garnish for 
cakes and desserts. 

Candied Liemon.— (Condensed from Catharine Owen.) 
As lemons are used drop the yellow rind into a weak brine 
in a glass jar. When a dozen are thus pickled they are 
freshened by putting them into cold water and letting 
them scald, changing the water once or twice to extract 
the salt Boil them in the last water till they are thorough- 
ly tender, and drain. Then make syrup enough to cover 
them out of slightly more than a pound of sugar and a pint 
of water, using always the same proportion of pint for 
pound. Cut the peelings into dice about half an inch 
square, and drop them into the boiling syrup, which is 
allowed to cook slowly till the peelings look translucent. 
Then keep them slowly steeping till the syrup has almost 
dried out of the peel, spread on plates, sprinkle with more 
siijrHv. and set in a cool oven to complete the drying. 

Candied Orangre Peel.~(Mrs. Todd.) Soak the skin** 
in salt and water three or four days, then throw them into 
cold water and boil till tender; meanwhile clarify weight 
for weight of sugar. Scrape out all the pulp and strings, 
case one within another and put them in a stone jar. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 193 

When the syrup is cold pour it over them, and as it ^rows " 
thin, drain, add sugar enough to make the syrup rich again, 
and when it is quite cold pour it over the peelings a?ain. 
Let them remain till they are transparent, then t*ike them 
out, let them lie on the back of a sieve and dry in a slow 
oven. Take each one on the point of a fork and dip quick- 
ly in the ^yrup, the rounded part uppermost, and lay them 
again on the sieve to dry. When dried case them one 
within another and store in a dry place. 



FRUIT AND GELATINE, JELLIES AND SPONGES. 

Fruit jellies with gelatine as a basis are suitable for 
summer use or as a table decoration. Though they have 
little value for nourishment they are always delicious. 

Upon the packages of prepared gelatine or within them 
are direct ions for the preparation of jelly, which a novice 
can hardly fail to undei'stand. If, instead of cold water 
the gelatine is put to soak in fresh fruit juice, then sweat- 
eued, strained and cooled, the result will bo a dish pleasant 
alike t j the eye an i the palate. As the acidity of fruit 
varies, sugar must be added to the taste, remembering 
that it seems to the tongue less sweet when cool than 
when warm. 

Apple Jelly, No. 1.— Soak half a box of gelatine half an 
hour in one pint of cider fresh from the press. Pour over it 
one cupful of boiling water, stir in about one cupful of 
sugar, and the j iiice of one lemon. S crain, and set in a cool 
place. 

Apple Jelly, No. 2.— (Marion Harland.) One dozen well- 
flavored appley, two cupfuls powdered sugar, juice o* two 
lemons, and half a package of gelatine soaked in a scant 
cupful of cold water. Pare and slice the apples, putting

esLch piece in cold water to preserv^e the color. Pack theiu 
in a glass or stone-ware jar with just enough cold water to 
cover them, put on the top loosely that steam may escape, 
set in a pot of warm water and bring to a boiL Cook until 
the apples are broken to pieces. Have ready in a bowl the 
soaked gelatine, su^ar and lemon juice. Strain the appJe 
scalding hot over them ; stir until the gelatine is dissolved; 
strain again, this time through a flannel bag, without squeez* 
ing it. 

Banana Jelly, No. 1.— (Mrs. Keeler in Good House- 
keeping.) Soak one ounce of gelatine in half a pint of 
cold water ten minutes; add to this a fall pint of boiling 
water, the juice of tivo lemons and half a pint of granu- 
lated sugar. Stir well together and strain through a jelly- 
bag or flue wire-straiuer. Pour an inch deep in a mold, 
add a few slices of banana, and set outdoors in winter, or 
in the refrigerator in summer, until it hardens, keeping the 
remainder in a warm place. As soon as the first stiffens 
put another layer of bananas and jelly, again setting away 
to harden until all is used. This makes a sightly dish when 
served with whipped cream around the base. 

Banana Jelly, No. 2.— Make a jelly as in No. 1., then 
peel and cut cross ways in thin slices three oranges, peel 
and slice three bananas, and when the jelly is cool put a 
layer of it in the mold, a layer of oranges, one of bananas, 
then the jelly, and proceed as before. 

Berry Jelly.— Raspberries and blackberries must bo 
stewed till soft in a very little water. Crush them and 
strain out the juice, let it cool, and soak one box of gelatine 
in one pint of juice. Sweeten, pour over a quart of boiling 
water and strain mto m jJds. Serve with wMpped | cream. 

Cherry Jelly.— Dissolve one box of gelatine in one pint 
of cherry juice, either drained from canned fruit or ex- 
pressed from the fresh. Let it stand one hour. Then add 
one quart of boiling water, tlie juice and grated rind of two 
lemons, and about three-fourths of a pint of sugar, to the 
uncooked juice, strain and pour iu jelly molds. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 195 

Cranberry Jelly.— Soak the gelatine in one pint of 
cranberry juice for an hoar, add one pint of sugar, and 
turn over it one quart of boiling water. Strain, turn into 
a mold, and cool. This will take an entire box of gelatine. 
The cranberry juice is obtained by stewing the berries in a 
very Tttle water till soft, then mash them with a wooden 
spoon and strain through a jelly-l)ag. One quart of berries 
will make a little more than a pint of juice. 

Chocolate Jelly. —Soak half a box of gelatine in half a 
cup of cold water for an hour. Into one pint of milk, 
boiling, add two ounces of grated chocolate and the dis- 
solved gelatine. Let it boil, then take it from the fire, add 
half a cup of sugar and half a tea>>poonful of vanilla. Len 
it partially cool, stir till thick, add a pint of cream whipped 
to a froth, stir till mixed, pour into a mold, and serve with 
whipped cream. 

Currant Jelly.— Soak two ounces of gelatine in one 
pint of cold water for an hour. Put juice, gelatine and 
one pint of sugar into a porcelain kettle, let it come to the 
boiling point, then strain and cool. Before it is stiff add the 
whites of three eggs, beaten to a froth, and beat all together 
till light and frothy. Pour into a mold and set on the ice 
several hours before serving. 

* Currant Flummery.— This is made without gelatine, 
but seems to come in this department To the juice of two 
quarts of mashed and strained currants, add one pint of 
granulated sugar. Out of this take one pint to pour upon 
one pint of ground rice, which must be blended till it is per- 
fectly smooth. Boil the remainder of the juice in a farina 
kettle, in which stir the thickened juice carefully to prevent 
lumping. Cook till thick, pour into one large or sevt ral 
small cup molds. Set on the ice and serve with sweetened 
cream. 

Currant Ice.— Squeeze currants with or without 
a mixture of raspberries, through a jeUy-bag, and to 
each pint of j uice add the same quantity of water and sug-

beaten whites of three eggs, stirring constantly till it is 
perfectly cold. Freeze hard. 

Currant Sherbet.— Pour one pint boiling water over 
one pint of loaf sugar. Let it simmer half an hour, add 
one pint of currant juice and the juice of two lemons. 
Fteeze when cold. 

Grape Water-ice.— To every quart of water allow half 
as much grape-juice, by measare, and the same amount of 
sugar as of juice. Mai^easyrup, and when it is oold add 
juice and freeze. 

Liemou Water-Ice, No. 1.— Make a rich lemonade 
with one third the quantity of lemon juice as of water, to 
every three lemons allowing the j nice of one orange. When 
partly frozen scir in the whites of three eggs. 

Lieiuon Ice, No. 2. — Dissolve a heaping tablespoonf ul 
ofgelatinein half a pint of water, pour over a quart of 
boiling water and the strained juice of six lemons. Sweet- 
en with three-fourths of a pint of sugar and freeze. 

Liemon Jelly.— Cover half a box of gelatine with one 
pint; of cold water, into which break a small stick of cinna- 
mon. At the end of an hour add a cupful of sugar, the 
juice of two good-sized lemons, and a pint of boiling water.* 
Strain, mold and cooL 

Orange Jelly.— Make like lemon jelly, except that it 
needs a little less sugar and no cinnamon. 

lieiuon and Orange Jelly.— For one box of gelatine 
use two large lemons and the juice of two large oranges. 
Proceed as with other jellies. 

Peach, Plum and Pear Jellies.— Stew the fruit in 
little water, strain, apd use one pint of the j uice in wUich to 
soak one box of gelatine. Sweeten, pour over a full quart 
o'' boiling water, strain and cool. Juice left after canning

fruit can be utilized in this manner It should be made 
the day before it in used. 

Piue-apple Jelly, No. l.—Peel and chop fine one pine- 
npple and let it soak three hours with the juice and grated 
rind of a lemon and two cups of sugar, with a trifle of grated 
II utmeg. Then pour into it one ounce of isinglass dissol vecl 
in a teacupful of cold water, and lastly a pint of boiling 
water. Strain and press hard to expel the juice from the 
pine-apple. Pour into a mold and set on ice. 

Another way is to use three cupfuls of boihng water in- 
stead of a pint, and while the jelly is hardening to beat into 
it the well whipped whites of three eggs. It must be added 
a spoonful at a time. Cover the top with the meringue 
made by the white of an egg, a tablespoonful of powdered 
sugar and twice as much grated pine-apple. 

Pine-apple Jelly, No. 2.— Soak half a box of gelatine 
an hour in d cup of cold water and stir in a cup of sugar. 
Add a little more than half a cup of the liquor drained from 
a can of pine-apple, and a half pint of boiling water. Strain, 
stir in a cupful of the pine-apple chopped fine, turn into a 
mold, and set on ice. 

Quince Jelly.— Cut small, inferior quinces into pieces, 
discarding stems and imperfections, and stew with one pint 
of water to one quart of cut fruit. At the end of three 
hours, or before it is soft enough to break into jam, strain 
and use the juice for soaking gelatine. It will need only 
two-thirds as much as in other fruit juices. Sweeten, strain, 
and cool as usual. 

Strawberry Jelly.— Over a quart of fresh berries throw 
a cupful of sugar and set aside, in an earthen dish, to ex- 
tract the juice. At the same time soak one box of gelatine 
in a pint ot cold water, and, at the end of an hour, put in 
one cup of sugar and pour ovi^r it one pint of boiling water. 
Crush the strawberries and press them through a fine sieve 
and pour the dissolved gelatine over them through the 
fieve so as to lose none of the juice. Str.an, moll and

cool. There should be a full pint of the strawberry jnice* 
if more, use less water, so there will be no more liquid 
than the gelatine recipe calls for. In like manner propor- 
tion the sugar to the sweetness of the fruit. It is nice to 
pour the gelatine in the mold in layers with large selectel 
strawberries, first liquid, then berries Serve with cream. 

Apple Sponge.— Make a rich apple-sauce seasoned with 
sugar and lemon. To every pint and a half of apple take one 
ounce of gelatine, soak in iiaif a cupful of water.and dissolve 
over a boiling tea-kettle. Stir it into the apple and prets 
through a sieve; when cold beat in the stiff beaten whites of 
four eggs, and continue till it is stiff and lighs then pour 
into a mold and set on ice. Serve with cream or thin boil- 
ed custard. 

Banana Sponge.— Dissolve an ounce of gelatine in two 
tables poonfuls of cold water, and in a quarter of an hour 
pour over a pint of boiling water. Stir into it the juice of 
one lemon and a cupful of sugar, and let the gelatine 
thoroughly dissolve. Strain through a thin bag and l3t it 
cool. Cut three bananas into small pieces and beat them 
to a pulp with an egg-beater, then whip to a froth the 
whites of two eggs, which are then beaten into the banana 
cream. When the gelatine is cold beat it into the egg and 
banana, a little at a time, till it is quite stiff. Serve with 
cream, or a thin custard made with the yolks of the two 
eggs and a pint of milk. 

Blackberry Sponge.— Soak half a box of gelatine in 
five tablespoonfuls of cold water twenty minutes, pour ove«* 
it two cupfuls of boiling water and four or ^Vsi tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, and into it turn a large cupful of blackberry 
juice. Strain it, set in on ice, and when cold, not hard.actvi 
the well-beaten whites of three eggs and beat till it is thick 
and light. Harden in a mold. 

Cherry Sponge.— This is made like Blackberry sponge, 
except that it requires a little more sugar. 

Currant Sponge.— Make like the above, using a full cup 



MISCELLANEOUS. 199 

of sugar, one cup of currant juice, or currant and raspberry 
mixed, half a box of gelatine, and one capful of boiling water. 
When cold beat in the beaten whites of three eggs. 

Figr Sponge.—Soak half a pound of plump figs in warm 
water till they are soft, and split each in two. Dissolve half 
an ounce of gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of cold water, 
heat one pint of milk and stir into it two well- beaten 
eggs, with two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, which must 
be stirred over the fire tih it thickens. Set the soaked gela- 
tine over the top of a boiling tea-kettle till it melts, stir it 
into the custard and set away to cool. When cool, but not 
thick, whip it with an egg-beater, and gradually add the 
well-beaten white of an egg. Dip the sections of split fig 
in any kind of jelly, which must be slightly warmed first, 
and with them line the interior of a buttered pudding- 
mold, into which pour the custard sponge which has been 
beaten till very light and flavored with a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Set in a cool place overnight 

lieiuon Sponge.— Soak an ounce of gelatine in half a 
cupful of cold water half an hour, and while soaking 
squeeze the juice of four lemons upon a large cupful of sug- 
ar, then beat the yolks of four eggs to a foam and mix with 
two- thirds of a pint of water. Into this stir the lemon and 
sugar, and cook in a far.«na kettle till it begins to thicken, 
then add the gelatine. Strain it into a basin or large bowl, 
and set in ice- water, occasionally beating it till it is cool 
but not hard. Then add the unbeaten whites of the four 
eggs, and beat steadily till it begins to thicken. If it stiffens 
too lapidly set the basin in warm water, then pour into the 
mold and set on the ice. Oranges may be used in place 
of lemons; in that case use six instead of four. 

Strawberry Sponge.-— Soak half a package of gelatine 
in half a cupful of water one hour, and over one quart of 
strawberries strew half a dozen tablespoonfuls of sugar in 
order to extract the juice. At the end of an hour mash 
the berries and press through a fine sieve. There should be 
over one pint. Pour a cupful of boiHng wat«r ever the t'al-

aline, add half a cupfal of sugar, stir and strain. Add tiie 
strawberry pulp, beat well, mix in the juice of a small lemon 
and the stiff beaten whites of three eggs, and continue to 
beat till the mixture is quite thick. The eggs she uld not be 
added till the gelatine is c jol. Harden in molds. 

Raspberry Sponge.— Make like Blackberry sponge, 
using two cupfuls of juice and one cupful of boiling water. 



FHUIT CREAMS, FLOATS, BLANC-MANGE AND 
MERINGUES. 

Under this heading the housekeeper who is mistress of 
her time can devise and arrange a numberless variety of 
delicious and comparatively inexpensive dishes. They are 
certainly far more digestiL)le than so many rich dainties, 
which demand much care and many ingredients in prepa- 
ration. In them the flavor of the fruit is perfectly preserved, 
since tbey are not changed by heat. They axe extremely 
suitable for lunches and light repasts in warm weather. 
Canned fruits and jellies may be substituted for the fresh 
when the soasoo for the latter has passed, but the flavoring 
is somewhat impaired by the fire-change. 

With fruit creams is usad isinglass or gelatine, which 
should always be dissolved in half a cup of cold water to 
the ounce. Cooper's gelatine is good enough for this pur- 
pose. Into it is stirred the fruit or its juices, well sweet- 
ened, whipped cream, and sometimes the whipped whites 
of eggs. In making fancy dishes the housekeeper can 
pour into the mold first a layer of gelatine, then arrange 
a layer of fruit, and so on till the mold is filled. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 201 

Apple Snow.— Drain a cupful of apple-sauce heaped 
high, and press through a sieve. Sweeten to taste, and set 
it on the ice. Turn it Into a shallow dish, and over It turn 
the whites of two eggs. With an egg-beater or silver fork 
beat them together for twenty minutes, or till the mass is 
light and 6now-like. 

- Apple Meringue, No. 1.— Prepare apple- sauce out of 
tart juicy apples, season, strain, and pour into a deep pie- 
dish lined with paste. Whip to a stiff froth the whites of 
two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread over the 
top and return to the oven three minutes to brown. 

Apple Meringue, No. 2.— Make a syrup out of twice as 
much sugar as water, by measure, into which, when boil- 
ing, drop quarters of peeled sour apples. Use only enough 
at a time to let the syrup well cover them. When tender 
skim them out and drop in more apples, taking care to 
preserve them unbroken. Then arrange the quarters in 
a dish of crockery and pour over them a meringue flavored 
with rose or almond, as in No. 1., and set in the oven a few 
moments to brown. 

Apple Charlotte, No. 1.— (Mrs. Parker.) Grate ten 
sour apples and mix with two cupfuls of sugar. Jiine a 
large dish with slices of sponge cake, turn in the apple, 
make a hole in the middle and fill with currant jelly. Put 
in a mold and set on the ice for two hours. Turn out in 
a dish and cover the top with sponge cake. 

Apple Charlotte, No. 2.— Pare, core and stew in a 
very little water six or eight apples, according to size, press 
through a coarse sieve and add sugar enough to make it 
very sweet. While the apple is hot, mix in an ounce of 
gelatine which has soaked in six t ibledpooafuls of water, 
and stir thoroughly. Set the dish in another containing 
cold water, and stir till the mixture thickens, then cut into 
it a large cupful of cream whipped stiff. Turn into a 
mold and chill on ice. 



2W FRUITS AND HOW tO tTsE THEM. 

Apple Float.— Grate ten sour apples and chill on ice, 
aft-er sweetening and flavorinsr with lemon. Then heat to 
a froth the whites of four eggs, mix with the grated apples, 
and serve at once. 

Apricot Cream or Souffle, No. 1.— Take a tin of pre- 
served apricots, boil them in their own juice witii a little 
sugar till reduced to a pulp, then pass through a hair sieve. 
Mix a little rice flour with a gill of milk, stir it over the fire 
till it thickens, add, off the fire, the yolks of four e^gs, and 
as much apricot pulp as will make the mixture of the prop- 
er consistency; work it well so as to get it quite smooth, 
then add the whites of six eggs beaten up to a stiff froth; 
mix them in quickly with the rest, pour into a plain mold, 
and put it into the oven at once When the souffle is well 
risen serve without delay. 

Apricot Cream, No. 2.— Take a can of apricots, and 
put into a saucepan with two ounces of sugar; let it boil for 
a quarter of an hour, and strain through a colander. Dis- 
solve an ountie of gelatine in a little milk, and whip a pint 
of cream. Mix the gelatine with the apricot pulp, and 
work into the cream. Mold and put on ic*3. Serve cold. 

Apricot Bavarian Cream.— Stew a pint of fresh apri- 
cots or use a pint can of the same fruit, cut in pieces, and 
mash through a colander. Dissolve an ounce 0£' gelatine 
in a cup of cold w^^ter, which must be gradually heated till 
it is all dissolved. Then proceed as in apple charlotte, mix 
the gelatine and fruit, set the dish in another containing 
cold water or ice, and stir till the mixture thickens a little, 
then mix into it a pint of cream whipped to a froth. Pour 
into a mold and set on ice. If the apricots need more 
sugar sweeten to taste. In the same way make the fol- 
lowing recipe : 

Bavarian Fruit Cream.— Soak one quarter of a box 
of gelatine in four tablespoonf uls of c jld water for half an 
hour, and whip one pint of very cold cream till it makes a 
quart and a half, or even more. Boil three tablespoonf uls 



MlSOELLAKEOUfci. m 

of sugar in one cup of rick mill^, pour in the gelatine and 
stir till dissolved. Strain, and flavor as lilied, either with 
lemon, vanilla, chocolate or four tablespoonfuls of strong 
coffee. Place the bowl in very cold water, stir often, an. I 
when it is cold, and beginning to thicken, stir in the whipped 
cream. 

To convert this cream into apricot, peach, cherry, orange 
or strawberry charlotte it is only necessary to line the 
bottom of the mold with the preserved or candied fruit and 
fill it with cream. Sliced bananas and fresh stra^vberries 
may be used in the pame manner. 

Blackberry Cream.— Over two quarts of ripe blackber- 
ries sprinkle half a cupful of sugar and mash them with a 
wooden spoon. Set them a^ide for a coux>le of hours, then 
strain through a very thin cloth or strainer. Partly whip 
one pint of sweet cream, then add the fruit juice, made sweet 
with half a cupful of sugar or even more. Whip again, and 
gradually add the stiff beaten whites of cwo eggs, whipping 
constantly till no more cream arises. Serve at once. 

Cherry Cream.— Take two quarts of cherries— heaping 
quarts— bruise them without removing the pits, throw 
over them three-fourths of a cupful of sugar, and let them 
stand in a cool place two hours. Then strain, and proceed 
as with Blackberry cream That is, sweeten the j uice after 
straining, beat one pint of cream, gradually add the juice 
and the beaten whites of two eggs, continually whisking it 
till no more froth arises. The secret of success is to have 
cream, ice and eggs all thoroughly chilled on ice, and in 
adding the juice a little at a time to prevent curdling. 

In the same way make currant cream. The berries and 
other fruits which have suflBcient juice can be used, also lem- 
on and orange cream. 

Chocolate Bavarian Cream.— Soak half a box of gel- 
atine in four tabiespoonfuls of water for twenty minutes, 
boil one pint of milk, into which stir two ounces of grated 
chocolate and the dissolved gelatine. Stir till all is dis- 
solved set the saucepan on the back of the stove with 



2C4 FBUrrS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

enough sugar to sweeten well, and add one tea.spoon- 
ful of vanilla. Stir while cooling, and as it grows thick 
mix with it two cupfols of cream whipped to a froth. Turn 
into a mold to harden. 

Chocolate Creaai.— One square of Baker's chocolate, 
scraped very line, one teacupf ul of sugar, yolks of two eggs, 
one-half teacupful o" sweet milk. Cook over steam until 
thick, then fill the shells, using spoonful of mixture for each 
tart Frost top with following : 

Meringue.— Beat whites of vwo egga to a stiff froth, add 
two tablespoonf ul4» grated chocolate, six tabiespoonfuls sug- 
ar, one-half teaspoonful lemon extract. Spread frosting 
evenly over tarts. Place in oven to harden. Serve cold. 

Cocoanut Cream. — Add one cupful ot water to one 
grated cocoanut^ and press through a moderately fine 
strainer. Boil together a cupful of water and twice as 
much sugar twenty minutes, then add the cocoanut to an 
equal quantity of this syrup. When it is a little cool, stir 
it slowly into the weU-beaten whites of six e^^ga, and contin- 
ue stirring over the fire till it is thick like custard. Pine* 
apple grated may be prepared in the same manner. 

Cocoanut Snow.— Grate a cocoanut and sprinkle pul- 
verized sugar lightly through it. Beat the whites of eight 
eggs to a stiff froth, add to them four large spoonfuls of 
fine sugar, beat well, and flavor with rose-water. Take half 
tiie cocoanut and stir into it one pint of thick, rich cream. 
Lay the remainder of the cocoanut lightly over this, and 
put the eggs and sugar over the top. Decorate the dish 
with bright-colored jelly. 

FruitTrifle.— Soak an ounce of isinglass in half a cup 
of water fifteen minutes, add the juice of a lemon and the 
grareJ peol of half, and a teacupful of sugar. Over this 
pour two and a half cupfuls of boiling water, and strain. 
"When it is cool, but before it has thickened, pour it over a 
mold lined with oranges divided into sections and thin slices 
of bananas f /eshly pealed. Set on the ice.

Fruit Charlotte.— (Mrs. Lincoln.) Soak half a box of 
gelatine in half a cup of cold water till soft, and make a 
syrup of one cup of water and a cup of lemon juice (or a 
pint of orange juice and one cup water), with one cup of 
Bugar. When boiling pour it into the beaten yolks of four 
eggs. Stir well, and cook in a double boiler till it thickens. 
Add the soaked gelatine, stir till dissolved, and strain at 
once into a granite pan placed in ice- water. Beat occa- 
sionally till cold and not hard. Beat the whites of the eggs 
to a stiff froth, and then beat all together till it thickens. 
When almost stiff enough to drop, pour into molds lined 
with cake. Keep on ice, and serve with or without pow- 
dered sugar and cream. Vary the fruit by stirring one 
pint of canned peaches, pine-apple or apricots in one <;up 
each of sugar and water till soft, then sift, add the yolks of 
eggs, and cook till it thickens. Add the gelatin's strain, 
and when cool add the whites. Grated pine- apple will not 
require sifting. 

Liemon Cream, No. 1.— Chill on the ice three cupfuls 
of cream about a day old, and sweeten to taste. Beat it to 
a froth and stir in the juice of four lemons and a table- 
spoonful of gelatine, softened in cold water, and then dis- 
solved in a little hot water. It should be cold before 
stirring into the cream. Porr into an oiled mold without 
or with a thin lining of jlain cake. Let it stand several 
hours before serving. 

Leniou Cream, Tfo. 2.— Take the juice and grated 
rind of one la»'ge lemon, beat into it half a pint of sugar, 
the same qua'^.tity of cream, and half a cupful of cold water, 
and lastly th'^ Arell-beaten whites of three eggs. Heat half 
a cupful of milk and thicken it with two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch, made smooth, and stir that in also. Turn it in- 
to a mold and set on ice. Serve with or without whipped 
cream. 

Liemon Meringue.— Beat lightly the yolks of four eggs, 
add one cupful of sugar, three fourths as much water, wiih 
a part of which make smooth one tablespf^ouful of flour, 



306 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

and the juice of a large lemon, with two-thirds of its grated 
yellow rind. Bake in a pie-dieh lined with pastry, and 
when done cover with a meringue of the whites and three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Brown a few moments m the 
oven. 

Liemou Float* — Dissolve a \ ackage of gelatine in a little 
cold water, then pour over enough water to make a quart in 
all. Sweeten with a pint of sugar, and add the juice of four 
or five lemons, according to their size. Strain, and stir in 
the bep.ten whites of ten eggs. It ought to be cold and 
should be served immediately. 

Orange Snow.— Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a pint 
of boiling water, strain it, and let it stand till nearly cold- 
Mix with it the juice of six or seven oranges and one lemon. 
Add the whites of three egg^, and sugar to tuste. Whisk the 
whole together until it looks white anil like a sponge. Put 
it into a mold and turn it out on the following day. 

Oranges Jellied.— Peel a dozen medium-sized oranges, 
cut them up very small, rejecting all seeds. Put them in a 
dish larger than they will 31], sweeten very liberally. Take 
one- half box of Cooper's gelatine, dissolved in a little cold 
water, then pour on it one cap of boiling water, stir well, 
and add to it the oranges, mixing very thoroughly. Set 
away in a cold place or on ice. 

Orange Charlotte.— (Mrs. Lincoln.) One-third box of 
gelatine, one- third cupful of cold water, one-third cujjful 
of boiUng water, one cupful of sugar, juice of one lemon, 
one cupful of orange juice and pulp, three eggs, whites 
only. 

Line a mold or bowl with lady's-fingers or sections of 
oranges. Soak the gelatine in cold water till soft Pour on 
the b(»iling, water. Add the sugar and the lemon juice. 
Strain, and add the orange juice and pulp, with a little of 
the gratt d rind. Cool in a pan of ice-water. Beat the 
whites of the eggs stiff, and when the orange jelly begins to 
harden, beat it till light. Add the beaten whites, and beat 
together till stiff enough to drop. Pour into the mold. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 207 

One pint of whipped cream may be used instead of the 
whites of the eggs, or it may be piled on the top after the 
Charlotte is removed from the mold. 

Orangre Meringue,— Beat till light the yolks of three 
eggs, ami then beat in a scant cupful of sugar. Stir in the 
juice of two oranges and the grated peel of one-half of one, 
and a cupful of milk. Bake either in a small pudding-dish 
or a deep pie- dish lined with paste. When done make a 
meringue of the three whites with as many tablebpoonfuls 
of sugar, return to the oven long enough to brown, and 
serve warm or cold. 

Orang^e Charlotte,— Soak one-third of a package of 
gelatine in one-third of a cupful of water till it is soft, tlien 
I)our on one-half of a cupful of boiling water, and stir till the 
gelatine is dissolved, adding to it one cupful of sugar and 
the juice of one lemon, to increase the flavor, and the juice 
of enough oranges to make an additional cupful of pulp and 
liquid. Strain, and while the jelly is cooling beat to a 
etiff froth the whites of three eggs, then beat the jelly till 
that is also light Lightly stir together the jelly and whites 
of eggs, and pour into a mold lined with stale sponge cakp. 
In place of the whites of eggs use one pint of whipped 
cream, if desired. It is good without the sponge cake or 
with any other kind ofplain cake. 

Orangre Float,— Blend smoothly four tablespoonfuls 
of corn-starch with the same quantity of water, and over 
it pour a quart of boiling water. Stir into it a heaping 
cupful of sus:ar, and the juice of one lemon. When it thick- 
ens on the stove take it off, and as it cools pour it over six 
sliced oranges divested of their seeds, or two oranges and two 
sliced bananas. Stir and serve. 

Orange Cream,— Squeeze the juice and pulp of three 
oranges into a bowl. Add the juice of half a lemon, three 
ounces of sugar, one and a half pints of cold water; let it 
come to a boil, and then strain. Dissolve two tablespoon- 
fuls of corn-starch in a little cold water, rub it smooth and

add to it the strained juices; let it boil fifteen minutes to 
cook ISie corn-starch. Then set it awde in The ice box to 
become quite cold. Beat up the whites of +hree eggs to a 
foam, whip it into the corn-starch, and it is ready tor use. 
It may be served in tart shells or fancy cases. 

Peach Bavarian Cream.— (A. T). A.) Soak one 
package of Cox's gelatine in one cupful of cold milk taken 
out of two quarts, and put on the remainder in a farina 
kettle. When it nears the boiling j^oint put in the gelatine, 
and when dissolved add one small cupful of sugar, and 
strain the beaten yolks of four eggs with a little of the hot 
milk which has been dipped out and will prevent curdling. 
Cook five minutes, and pour into molds to form. When it 
has thickened to the consistency of custard, slice some 
peaches, take out some of the mixture, and place alternate 
layers until the mold is full. When the gelatine has con- 
gealed the fruit will be as richly colored as when sliced. 
Beat up the .vhites of the four eggs to a stiff froth with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and when the mold is turned out 
pile the meringue around the base in large spoonfuls. 

Peach Meriugue,— As usual in creams dissolve half an 
ounce of gelatine in half a cup of water, then beat it into a 
pint and ahalf of sweet cream, and as it stiffens stir in the 
beaten whites of four eggs, with as many tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. On the bottom of a large dish arrange- a quart of 
sliced peaches dredged with sugar, and over it pour the 
cream. Berve immediately. 

Peach Charlotte,— (Mrs. Lincoln.) Line a mold or 
bowl with lady's-fingers or sections of oranges. Soak one 
third of d, box of gelatine in one thiid of a cup of cold water 
till soft. Pour on it a tGird of a cup of boiling water, add 
one cupful of sugar, and the j uica of one lemon. Strain, and 
add one cupful of stewed or canned peach, pine-apple or 
apricot, pressed through a colander or coarse sieve, and cool • 
in a pan of ice- water. Beat stiff the whites of three eggs, 
and when the jelly begins to harden beat it till light. Add 
the beaten whites, and beat together till stiff enough to

drop. Pour iato the mold and set on ice. In the same 
way make apple chailotle. In place of the peaches use 
one cup of cooked sour apples, steamed, drained and sifted, 
or canned apricot or pine-apple, or one pint of fresh rasp- 
berries or strawberries. Mash the fruit and rub through a 
sieve before using. 

Pine-apple Blanc-Mange,— (The Home-Maker.) 
Heat three cups fresh milk to boiling, stir in a pinch of 
soda when heated, add in one cupful of sugar and half a 
box of Cooper's gelatine, soaked in half a cup of cold water. 
Strain, pour into a mold, and when perfectly cold and 
beginning to form, add one small up pine-apple either 
f rosh or canned, chopped fine. By wai ting thus long there 
is less danger of the fruit curdling the milk. 

Pine-apple Bavarian Cream,— (Helen Campbell.) 
Whip one pint of cream to a stiff froth and lay it on a sieve. 
Boil one pint of milk, with half a cup of sugar and half a 
teaspoonful of vanilla, and add to it half a package of 
gelatine soaked half an hour in half a cup of warm water. 
Stir in the beaten yolks of three eggs, and let it cooL Add 
then one cup of pine-apple marmalade, stir till very smooth, 
then add the whipped cream, mixing all well Put in 
molds and set in ice. This is one of the most perfect forms 
of these delicious creams. 

Raspberry Float,— Beat the whites of four eggs to a 
stiff froth, adding gradually six tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Mash a quart of red raspberries with half a cup of sugar, let 
them stand while beating the eggs, then press through a 
strainer and beat the juice, little by little, into the egg. 
Serve in small glass dishes. Strawberry float can be made 
in the same manner. 

Raspberry Cream, No, 1.— Put six ounces of raspberry 
jam to a quart of cream, pulp it through a lnwn sieve, add 
to it the juice of a lemon and a little sugar, and whisk it till 
thick. Serve it in a dish or glasses. 

Raspberry Cream, !N"o,2,— Take the desired quantity of

fully. ripe raspberries; bruise them, and sprinkle with a 
little pulverized sugar, let them remain for half an hour, 
then rub through a hair sieve. Measure the pulp, and mix 
an equal quantity of rich cream and sugar to make it 
sufficiently sweet Whip it up well, and as the froth forms 
place it on an inverted sieve to drain. When no more 
froth can be obtained, place three or four each of maca- 
roons and lady's-fingdrs in a glass dish, spread a little rasp 
berry or currant jam over them, pour the remainder of the 
cream over all, and just before serving pile the froth cream 
on top of all. 

Raspberry Blanc-Mange.— Strain the juice of fresh 
stewed raspberries and sweeten to taste. Heat in a porce- 
lain saucepan, and when it boils stir in corn-starch, in the 
proportion of two heaping tablespoonf uls to one pint of 
juice: stir till cooked and pour into a wet mold. Serve 
with sugar and cream. In a similar manner make cherry 
or strawberry blanc-mange. The flavor will be suflBsiently 
fc-trongif the juice is diluted with one third its measure of 
water. 

Raspberry Bavarian Cream,— Soak half a box of 
gelatine half an hour, and gradually beat it till all is 
dissolved. Turn into it two cupfuls of raspberry juice and 
six tablespoonfuls of sugar, or enough to sweeten it well. 
Set it in a cool place and stir as it thickens; mix in two 
cups of sweet cream, whipped to a cream, and tui n in a 
mold to harden. 

Strawberry Cream.- Take a pint of capped straw- 
berries and sugar them well. Set aside for an hour to 
allow the juice to ej-cape, then crush them, and press 
through a fine sieve. Soak half an ounce of gelatine in a 
very little cold water; when soft add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the juice of one lemon. Heat to the boiling 
point, then strain into the strawberry juice. Beat all to- 
gether well, and into it, when cooled, stir lightly 
half a pint of cream beaten to a foam. Turn into a mold 
and chill on ice. Serve with or without cream. 



MISCELLANEOUS. SJll 

Strawberry Bavarian Cream.—Soak an ounce of 
gelatine in 8ix tablespoonfuls of cold water for twenty- 
minutes, while one quart of strawberries is mashed with 
one cup of sugar. Press the fruit through a fine sieve, grad- 
ually heat the gelatine, adding, if necessary, a very little 
hot water, and strain it into the berry juice. Set it in cold 
water or ice, and stir till it thickens, then add a pint of 
cream well whipped. Pour into a mold and chill on ice. 

Strawberry Float.— Chop fine three pints of straw- 
berries and stir in three-fourths of a cupful of powdered 
sugar, more or less according to thei r acidity. At the end of 
an hour mix in the beaten whites of three eggs, and serve at 
once in small glasses. 

Strawberry Charlotte.— Boil half a cupful of rice five 
minutes in a quart of water, strain, and boil till done in a 
quart of milk. Rub the rice through a sieve. To one 
pint of it add an ounce of gelatine, dissolved in two table- 
spoonfuls of water and the milk remaining after it is 
drained from th*e rice. Cook together three minutes, stir, 
co^il, flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and stir in 
the well- beaten whites of two e^ga. Pour it over a quart of 
capped strawberries, or any other kind of berries, and pile 
whipped cream around the whole. 

Strawberry Charlotte Busse.— Dissolve an ounce of 
isinglass in a few tablespoonfuls of milk, taken from a 
quart of rich new milk measured out for this purpose. 
Sweeten to taste, after heating the remainder of the milk 
and pouring over the gelatine. Flavor with vanilla, strain, 
and pour into molds to cool. Turn it out on a thin sponge 
cake covered with a thix^k layer of strawberry jam, and 
pour around it a pint of whipped cream.

FRUIT ICE-CREAM. 

With the aid of late improvements in freezers, icecream 
can be readily made in every household. In fact cream 
may be frozen in a deep can or cylinder some four or live 
inches in diameter, by the aid of a tight-fitting cover, a 
long v^ooden epatula, plenty of ice and salt, and a box or firkin 
suffident to pack them in. If the can is well-packed with 
rock-salt and ice, and the cream thoroughly beaten and 
scraped frcm the sides and bottom every few minutes, it 
will not take a great amount of strength to provide this 
delicious dessert. 

It is necessary to have the ice crushed .fine and to be 
mixed with one quarter its amount of rock-salt in order to 
get quick results. There should l)e alternate layers of ice 
and salt packed closely iiround the freezer till it is filled. 
Then tarn into it the milk, custard, or cream, turn or beat 
slowly at first, afterward more rapidly, and at the end of 
half an hoiu: the cream ought to be sufficiently fine and 
solid. If desired, pack it in molds, which must be covered 
and buried in salt and ice. Too much care can not be 
taken to prevent as much as a drop of salt water from en- 
tering mold or freezer. The cream ought to be very 
cold before the freezing process. If the cream is to be 
kept some time in the can, cover it with bagging or old 
woolen cloths wet in salt water. 

In freezing fruit creams, rich Aldemey milk is good 
enough for use vnth the addition of a trifle of cream. 
When that can be had it is far better than any custanl 



MISCELLANEOUS. 213 

The unbeaten whites of three or four eggs dropped into 
new milk heiore it is put into the freezer is an excellent 
substitute for cream where custard is disliked. Whatever 
may be used it is needful to make tlie custard or cream 
very sweet. Freezing deadens the sweetness and makes 
a great demand upon saccharine material. 

It is best to add fruit or flavoring to cream after it is 
partly frozen, and to scald the cream gives it a peculiarly 
velvety taste, as every connoisseur is aware. While these 
two points are not reiterated in any one of the following 
recipes, they should not, therefore, be omitted, except in 
pine-apple and berry creams, unless time is wanting. 

Either of the following recipes can be used as the foun- 
dation of all fruit creams. 

Ice- Cream, No. !•— (Phila. Ice-Cream.) Scald two 
quarts of cream, or half cream and half new milk, and in it 
dissolve one pint of sugar. When partly frozen beat in the 
chopped fruit, pulp or juice, and continue the freezing. 

Ice-Cream, No, 2,— (Miss Parloa.) BoiJ one pint of milk. 
Mix together one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
one saltspoon of salt, and beat in two whole eggs. Add the 
boiling milk, and when well mixed turn into a double-boil- 
er and cook twenty minutes, stirring constantly till smooth, 
after that» occasionally. It ought to cook about twenty 
minutes. 

With these two recipes, and even with only very rich 
milk and the whites of eggs as stated before, a large vari- 
ety of fruit creams may be prepared. 

Apple Ice-Cream,— Steam or bake large sweet apples, 
and press through a coarse sieve. Stir two cups of the pulp 
into one and one-half quarts of cream or costard as described 
above, and freeze. 

Apricot Cream,— To partly frozen cream add the mashed

pulp of a pint can of apricots, or twice as mach fresh fruiti 
which becomes reduced in quantity by peeling: and mash- 

Banana Cream, No. 1.— Peel and mash half a dozen 
large, ripe bananas, making them perfectly uniform and 
smooth. Beat them into a quart and a half of cream, cus- 
tard, or Alderney new milk, and freeze. 

Banana Cream, No. 2.— One pint of sugar, one pint of 
water; boil twenty minutes. Ten grated bananas; to the 
bananas add the yolks of five eggs, w ell \ eaten. Stir this 
into the boiling syrup, and boil six minutes. Remove from 
the fire. Stir in one quart of cream. When c )ol, freeze. 

Banana Cream, No. 3.— Into half a gallon of rich, 
sweetened Alderney milk or cream stir four sliced bananas, 
and freeze. 

Cocoauut Cream.— Use one grated cocoanut to every 
quart of prepared milk or cream, also the unbeaten yolks 
of two egg^. Flavor with orange, and freeze. 

Iiemon Ice-cream, No. 1.— (Mrs. Parker.) Mix three 
tablespoonfuls of corn-starch with two of unsalted butter, 
and dissolve in half a gallon of new milk ; add two well beat- 
en eggs, fcweeten, flavor with lemon extract, and freeze. 

Lemon Ice-Cream, No. 2.- (Ruth Hall.) Heat a 
quart of milk in a kettle of hot water; when it boils stir in 
three-fourths of a pound of sugar beaten with the yolks of 
four e^gs. Cook till it resembles a thin cream, stir in care- 
fully one tablespoonful of extract of lemon, and the siune 
quantity of dissolved gelatine, and freeze. 

Lemon Ice-Cream, No. 3.— (Mrs. Rorer.) Mix togeth- 
er nine ounces of sugar, tlie juice of twolemoas, one orange 
and the grated rind of three lemons, and stand in a cold 
place one hour. Put one quart of cream in a farina boil-

Quince Ice-Creani.— Into a quart of milk or cream, 
prepared as before dii'ected, stir a cupful of sweetened 
quince juice, and freeze. 

Raspberry Ice-Cream,— Cover a quart of berries with a 
cup of sugar and let them stand an hour. Then pour over 
them three pints <:»f rich milk or cream, and stir them to- 
gether. At the end of another hour strain, add more sugar, 
and freeze. 

Orange Ice-Cream.— Allow the juice of four or five 
oranges, according to size, to every quart of cream, or cream 
and milk, half and half. Allow a cup and a half of sugar, 
upon which grate the peel of one lemon. Sc^ld the cream, 
and when cool add the orange juice and sugar, and freeze. 

Peach Cream.— Make precisely like apricot cream. 
Peaches may also be pared and mashed to a pulp before 
being added to the partly frozen cream. To one quart of 
very sw^eet peaches add one quart sweet cream. 

Pine-apple Cream.— Chop fine one pine-apple aud 
sprinkle over the pieces a little less than one pound of sug- 
ar. At the end of two hours beat it into one quart of cream 
and freeze rapidly as possible. 

Strawberry Ice-Cream.— This cream is made like the 
raspberry cream. No recipe rule can be given concerning 
the amount of sugar, as berries vary greatly in regard to 
sweetness, but it needs to be very sweet. Do not heat the 
cream. 

Strawberry Cream, No. 1.— (Mrs. Rorer.) Put half 
a pound of sugar and a pint of cream on to boil in a fa- 
rina kettle; when the sugar is dissolved, stand aside to cool. 
Add another half pound of sugar to a quart of strawbenies, 
with the juice of one lemon. Mash, stand aside one hour, 
then strain through fine muslin. Add another pint of 
cream co the sweetened cream and freeze. When half froz- 
en stir in the fruit juice; beat thoroughly, and freeze. If 
canned fruit is used, less sugar will be required. 



216 FKUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Strawberry Cream, No. 2. Mash together one quart 
of berries and one pound of sugar. At the end of two 
hours rub through a coarse sieve and add one quart of 
cream. 

'/" Tutti Frutti, No. 1.— Chop fine two ounces of blanoh- 

; t r/ ^f <jj\G ^i\\o\nQ ^ and mix with one quart of cream and one pint of 

sugar. When partly frozen throw in two-thirds of a cupful 

each of finely chopped raisins, citron and orange preserves. 

Stir thoroughly, and finish freezing. 

Tutti Frutti, No. 2.— Make a Neapolitan cream by 
beating the yolks of six eggs, then beating in a scant pint 
of sugar, and lastly the whites whisked to a stiff froth. Boil 
a quart of cream in a double boiler and gradually stir in the 
eggs and sugar. Stir till the custard begins to thicken. 
Strain it through a sieve and let it cool. When partly froz- 
en add a pound of finely chopped candied fruits, including 
cherries, pine-apples, angelica root* strawberries, apricots 
or plums. Let the cream stand a couple of hours after it is 
frozen, in order to let the flavors perfectly blend. In place 
of the French fruit, if preferred, use home-made preserves, 
chopped raisins, currants and citron, or grated cocoanut, in 
the proportion of a quart of the prepared fruit to the 
same quantity of milk or cream before it is ready for freez- 
ing. 



FRUIT WATER-ICES AND SHERBETS. 

Cooling mixtures flavored with fruits and destitute of 
cream are more wholesome than the richer preparations 
which have been described. They seem to bring with 
them a breath from the Orient, mingled with dreams of 
the shaded courts and pleached alleys, the rose-leaf con- 
serves and tinkling foimtains of that Eastern country in 
which the sherbet originated. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 217 

Water-ices are made out of fruit juice, syrup or jelly, 
the former giving the most satisfactory results. The 
water and sugar aie to be measured, boiled and skimmed 
before adc^iug the juice of the fruit, for boiling dissipates 
much of that ethereal flavor which cannot be restored. 
Water-ices of all kinds require more time for freezing than 
creams, and the process must be cai-ried on more slowly. 
They are molded and packed in the same manner. 

Apple Sherbet.— To two quarts of sweet new cider add 
the juice of two lemons and a cup of sugar. Freeze with- 
out heating. 

Citron Ice.— Stir one quarter of a pound of thinly- 
sliced citron, cut into dice, into a quart of rich lemonade, 
and freeze. 

Cherry Wateir-Ice.— Mash two quarts of commo^ cher- 
ries, and break some of the pits, which must be chopped and 
added to the pulp; twenty will be enough to give sufficient 
flavor. Let them macerate an hour or two, then press 
through a jelly- bag. Boil a pint and ti half of sugar and 
the same quantity of water, and when the pyrup cools add 
the cherry juice and freeze. 

Currant Ice.— Boil a quart of water and a pound 
of sugar to a syrup. Skim, and stir in two cupfuls of cur- 
rant jelly or a pint of fresh currant juice, and two more cup8 
of sugar heated together till the sugar has dissolved. 
Freeze a quai'ter of an hour, then stir in the unbeaten 
whites of four eggs. 

Orange Water-Ice— Soak a tablespoon ful of gelatine 
in half a cupful of cold water twenty minutes, then pour 
over it a cupful of boiling water and stir till dissolved. 
Mix with ic half a cupful of powdered sugar, the strained 
juice of six oranges, and enough water to make a quart of 
liquid; strain through a jelly- bag and freeze. 

Lemon Ice.— Dissolve one tablespoonful of gelatine 



218 PEUIT8 Al» HOW TO USE THfiM. 

in a little water takea oat of a measured quart of 
water, boil the remainder with a pound of sugar and stir in 
the gelatine. When cold add the juice of two oranges and 
five lemons, and freeze. A little of the peeling should t»e 
grated in with the lemon- juice. 

Orange Sherbet, No, 1.— To every quart of water use 
the juice of six oranges, two small lemons, the whites of 
tw<»eggs, and one large teac-upful of sugar. The latter, 
however, must be proportioned to the size of fruit ana the 
amount^ and caE only be told by tasting. Make a syrup of 
su^r and water, add the grated rind of an orange and a 
lemon, boil up, and set away to cool. With this mix the 
juice pressed from the lemons and oranges, and freeze. 

Orange Sherbet, No. 2, -To every quart of water add 
the juice of four oranges and the juice of two lemons; when 
nearly frozen stir in the beaten whites of three eggs. 

Orange Ice.— Grate the rinds of four oranges, and steep 
them ten minutes in a pint of water. Strain it upon one 
pound of sugar, add a pint of orange juice, and, when 
cold, pour into the freezer. When half frozen, add the 
whites of four eggs, beaten to a stiflf froth. 

Pine-Apple Sherbet.— To one pint of nice finely grated 
pulp allow the same quantity of sugar, and a pint and a 
half of water. Make a syrup of the latter, cool, add the 
pulp, the juice of one lemon, and, when half frozen, the 
beaten whites of two eggs. 

Raspberry Ice.- With one quart of red raspberries 
stir a pint of sugar and the juice of two lemons. Strain 
through a fine sieve, add a quart of water, the whites of 
three eggs, and freeze. 

Strawberry Ice.— To one quart of fruit after it has been 
pressed through the colander add three- fourths of a pound 
of sugar, or mor? if the berries are not very sweety and the 
unbeaten whites of three eggs and one cupful of water.

Strawbei ry Sherbet,— One quart of strawberries, three 
pints of water, one lemon— the juice only, one tablespoonful 
orange-flower water, three-quarters of a pound white sugar. 
The strawberries should be freifh and ripe. Crush to a 
smooth paste, Add the rest of the ingredients (except sugar) 
and let it stand three hours. Strain it over the the sugar, 
squeezing the cloth hard; stir until the sugar is dissolved,

FRUIT AND TAPIOCA. 

All varieties of fruit are appetizing, wholesome, easily 
prepared and not over rich when combined with tapioca. 
It is nc^t necessary to give special directions for each kind 
of fruit tapioca, since the same method is applicable to 
all, except that such large fruits as apples and peaches 
need longer cooking than berries. 

Apple Tapioca, —Wash one half pint of tapioca and 
soak it one hour in two cupfuls of cold water. Boil it 
in a quart of cold water in a farina kettle until it looks 
clear. Then slice tart apples enough to cover the bottom 
of a pudding-dish an inch and a half thick, sprinkle with 
sugar, and pour over the cooked tapioca. Bake half an hour 
and serve either warm or cold with cream and sugar oi soft 
custard. 

Again, take large sour apples, pare and core and stew till 
Ihey begin to be tender, either with a very little water, well 
covered on the back of the stove or in a stnamer. Fill the 
core apertures while still hot with sugar, arrange, etamiing 
on the bottom of a pudding-dish, and pour over them the 
cooked tapioca. Bake as before. 

Blackberry Tapioca.— Stew one full pint of black- 
berries in a very little water ten minutes, turn them into a 



220 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

padding-dish and pour over them the tapioca, as prepared 
above. Bake and serve with sweet liquid sauce. 

Cherry, raspberry, strawberry, peach, orange and pine- 
apple tapioca are made by stirring fresh or canned fruit in- 
to the boiling tapioca when it has slowly cooked till it be- 
comes clear. It is prepared like apple tapioca though to a 
cup of tapioca there need be only two and a half cups of 
water. The fruit juice furnishes so much li'iuid that it 
may be cooked diier than when it is baked with apples, 
After it has boiled till clear, turn into the boiling tapioca 
one quart of fresh berries or one pint of stewed fruit, in- 
cluding cherries, sweeten according ti» their acidity, turn 
into a serving-dish, and set away to cooL 



FEOZEN FRUIT. 

Frozen Fruit,— Take very sweet grated apples, pears, 
peaches or quinces and freez*^ like cream. Canned fruit 
can be prepared in the same manner. All kinds of fruit 
can be chopped or mashed and frozen. The addition of 
gelatine and cream greatly improves them, but tht^y are 
toothsome without. 

Apricots Frozen,— Drain the juice from a quart can of 
apricots and mash them fine, after removing the stones. 
Into the syrup stir half a pint of sugar and one pint of wa- 
ter, boil it up and skiiu. To this add a heaping tablenpoon- 
ful of gelatine, dissolved in a little cold water, then the 
mashed pulp of the fruit Freeze when thoroughly cold. 

Frozen Bananas,-^Cut six large ripe red bananaa 
crosswise, in very thin slices; add half a pound of powdered 
sugar to them, let them stand an hour, then add a quart of 
water and the grated peel of a lemon. When sugar is dig- 
solved put the fruit in the freezer and freeze like ice- 
cream. The juice of one or two oranges is an addition. 

Frozen Cherries.— Sweeten one quart of pitted cherries 



MISCELLANEOUS. 221 

with the same loeasure of sugar and let them stand till the 
juice is drawn out. Stir them till the sugar dissolves, then 
add one quart f f water and freeze. If canned cherries are 
used, take less sugar. 

Frozen Fruit Mixture.— Mash together equal quanti- 
ties of raspberries and etraw berries, take as much currant 
juice and water, half and half, as there is, by measure, of 
berries, add the juice of one lemon to every quart of the 
mixture, stir in three-fourths of a pint of sugar to every 
quart when all is mixed, and let it stand, stirring often, till 
the sugar is dissolved. Freeze like cream. 

Frozen Oranges.— To the pulp of a dozen oranges add 
twice as much water and the juice of one large lemon. 
Sweeten to taste and freeze. 

Frozen Peaches.— Peel and slice peaches, discarding 
the pits, and mix with an equal quantity of peach sherbet. 
Make very sweet and freeze. The flavor Is increased by 
adding the water in which a dozen peach-pits, chopped fine, 
have been boiled. 

Frozen Raspberries and Strawberries.— Mash the 

berries, and to every quart before mashing add one pint of 
sugar and the juice of one large lemon. Cover them, let 
them stand two hours, add one quart of water and freeze. 

Frozen Pine-apple.— Grate the pine-apple, adding an 
equal amount of water. Sweeten well and freeze. 

Iced Pudding. - Boil one scant half-tablespoonf ul of 
arrowroot in one pint of new milk, and into it stir one and 
one-half quart of hot milk. Add three beaten eggs, three 
cups of sugar, and half a pound each of seeded raisins, cur- 
ran t>s and citron chopped fine. Flavor with vanilla, and 
freeze hard. 

Frozen Fruit.— Line a deep mold with vanilla ice-cream 
and fill the center with frash berries or chopped fruit of 
various kinds, and cover the whole with ice-cream. Pack 
|:i a fleeter and st*t in |ce to cbill, ^not freeze) the cream, 



222 FRUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

Frozen Puddingy. —(Mrs. Preston.) To three pints of 
new milk add three or four sticks of fresh cinnamon, two 
blades of mace, and one and one-fourth pounds of the best 
raisins, stemmed and stoned. Cover these tightly in a stew- 
pan and let them simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. Mean- 
while beat very light the yolks of five eggs, adding slowly, 
when light, one-half pound of pulverized feugar, making it 
as light and creamy as possible. When ready, strain the 
spice and raisins from the milk, and save them to put in 
agoin later. Put it back to boil, stir in the eggs and sugar, 
beating until it simmers once. Then remove from the fire, 
and when cold, stir in one-fourth pound of blanched al- 
monds that have been pounded in a mortar, with a little 
rose-water, then the raisins that have been boiled in the 
milk, one-half pound of the best citron, and a small quan- 
tity of preserved ginger, cut into very thin, small slices. 
Mix all well together, add a quart of rich cream, stir till 
nicely mixed, and freeze as ice-cream. 



FRUIT PICKLES. 

Pickles aie an appetizing relish, though far from whole- 
some. If they must be used the best cider vinegar should 
be taken, and the scalding should be in kettles of porce- 
lain or grauite-ware, never iu tin or iron. Spices ought 
to be scantily used and so skillfully blended that no c»ne 
kind overpowers the others. Pickles must be kept iu jars 
of glass or stone which have never held any kind of fat. 
They ought to be set in a cool, dark cellar. 

Apple Pickles, No, 1, — Make a syrup of three pounds 
of sugar to a pint of vinegar. When it comes to a boil 
drop in apples peeled, cored, and quartered. Cook till 
they are tender, then skim out and place in glass jars set 
in a pan of hot water. In the syrup, when first made, drop 



MISCELLANEOUS. 323 

a cotton bag filled with a teaspoonfal each of cinnamon, 
doves and allspice. After the apples are taken out boil the 
syrup fifteen minutes longer; fill the jai*s and seal whil ■ hot. 
In the same manner pickle whole crab-apples, peaches and 
pears. If a sour pickle is desired, do not boil the vinegar, 
but when it is scalding hot, drop in the apples and keep 
them closely covered, just below the boiling point, till they 
are tender. This amount of syrup will pickle about seven 
pounds of Iruit 

Apple Pickles, No. 2.— Peel a peck of smooch, sweet 
apples, leaving on the stems. Dissolve two pounds of best 
brown sugar in one quart of vinegar, and in it drop a bag 
containing two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon and half o, tea- 
spoonful of cloves. Before it bolls turn out balf the vinegar 
syrup, which should be kept closely covered vsrith porcelain 
or granite from the first, and set aside in glass or stone. 
Into the remainder drop the whole apples, and simmer 
slowly till they are tender but unbroken. Skim them out 
of the syrup and put in small stone jars or two quart glass 
cans. Throw away the syrup in which the apple has been 
cooked, or keep it to stew fruit for immediate use, then heat 
the remainder to a point slightly below boiling and pour 
over the apples. If they are kept in stone, an inverted 
saucer should be placed over them to keep them covered 
with the syrup. If sealed in glass, they will keep like any 
other fruit, otherwise see that they are in a cool, dark place. 
Large sweet apples may be quartered and prepared in the 
same manner. 

Blackberry Pickles. —Make a syrup as for Apples 
No. 1 and boil the berries till they are tender. Seal in jars. 
They need no spices. 

Clierry Pickles.— Take large cherries before they are 
ripe enough to be soft, and put them, stems on, into jars of 
stone or glas& Heat the jars in hot water, and pour over 
them a syrup made with a pint of vinegar to every three 
pounds of sugar. Tie in a bag a teaspoonful each of cinna-

raon, allspice and cloves. Drain off the liquid and heat to 
boil every morning for a week. Pour it, while hot. over 
the cherries, which mu&t be kept in a cool, dark cellar, or 
sealed in cans. Blackberries njay be pickled in the same 
manner. One pound of suprai" ought to cover nearly a gal- 
lon of fruit. For a sourer pickle use half as much sugar. 

Crab-apple Pickles are made like apple pickles. 

Cranberry Pickles.— [See directions for Cherry Pickles.] 

Spiced Currants.— Take five pounds of fruit, four of 
brown sugar, a little less than two tablespoonfuls of cloves, 
same quantity of cinnamon, boil two hours, then add one 
pint of vinegar and boil fifteen minutes. Grapes may be 
prepared in the same way, having first taken the seeds out 
a& for preserves. Add a trifle of cayenne. 

Grape Pickles.— Take grapes fresh from the vines and 
net too ripe, and pick from the stem, without breaking, and 
pack in stone or glass jars. For every seven pounds of 
fruit take one quart of vinegar, four pounds of sugar, an 
even teaspoonful of cloves and one of cinnamon tied in a 
bag; bring the vinegar, sugar and spices just to the boiling 
point, then, when a little cooled, turn over the grapes. 
If they are in a stone jar, a small plate must be placed over 
the top to prevent their rising above the liquor. With the 
amount of vinegar given they will keep a long time with- 
out scalding. 

Lemon Pickles.— They should be small and with thick 
rind Rub them with a piece of flannel; then slit the 
fruit half down in four quarters but not through to the 
pulp; fill the slits with salt hard pressed in; set them upright 
in u pan for four or five days until the salt melts, turn them 
thrice a day in their own liquid, until tender. Make enough 
pickle to cover them, of vinegar, the brine of the lemons, 
one Jamaica pepper and a small piece of ginger. Boil and 
skim; when cold, pour over the lemons, with two ounces of 
mustard-seed to six lemons. When the lemons are used, 
the pickle will be useful in fish and other sauces. 



MISCEIiLANEOUS. 235 

Pickled Peaches, No. 1.— Wipe off the down from a 
dozen free-stone peaches and put them in a brine strong 
enough to bear up an egg. In two days take them out, 
drain through a sieve, and put them in a jar. Tie in a bag 
one ounce of whole white pepper, one of broken ginger-root 
and two of mustard-seed. Scald a full quart of vinegar, and 
while hot pour over the peaches. If sweet pickles are de- 
sired, use one and one half pounds of sugar to every quart 
of vinegar. 

Pickled Peaches, No. 2.— Peel seven pounds large 
peaches and put them into a porcelain kettle with cold syr- 
up, made in the proportion of a pin t of vinegar to four 
pintri of sugar. Tie a teaspoonf ul of cloves and a tablespoon- 
ful of cinnamon and half an ounce of ginger in a bag, and 
drop into the syrup, which must be gradually heated till it 
boils. Then take out the peaches and pour the liquor over 
them. Cover them and the next morning drain off the syr- 
up, scald, and pour over the fruit. Continue to do so for a 
week. 

Some persons prefer the unpeeled peaches with four cloves 
stuck in each. The shape is. la us preserved, but the skins 
are peculiarly tough. It is better to keep them in closely 
sealed cans till needed. Only as much fruit must be used as 
the syrup will cover. 

Pickled Pears.— Dissolve two pounds and a half of 8Ug- 
ar in a quart of cider vinegar, and drop into it a bag filled 
with a tablespoonf ul of ground cinnamoi and half a grated 
nutmeg. This amount of syrup will cover a little more 
than two pounds of fruit. If the pears are small, pickle 
them whole, if large, cut them in halves and take out ♦.he 
core; the skin may or may not be removed. Cover closely, 
simmer till tender, skim them out into cans or jars, cook the 
syrup fifteen minutes longer, pour over them, and seaL 

Peaches Spiced.— Peel large peaches but do not remove 
the pits. To six pounds of fruit take three and a half of 
sugar, one quart of vinegar, and one teaspoonf ul eachof cin- 



226 FBUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

nainon and cloves tied in a bag. Boil slowly for an hour, 
in a granite or porcelain kettle, and can while hot. Pears 
may be spiced in the same way; so may apples. 

Pine-apple Pickle.— Slice the pine-apple very thin 
and pour over it a syrup made of two pounds of sugar to 
a pint of vinegar, with spices of cloves, cinnamon and all- 
spice. The next morning drain off the syrup, boil up again, 
and pour over the fruit. Repeat it twice afterward. Ripe 
musk-melon, ripe cucumber, and water-melon is pickled in 
the same manner. The rind is cat in thick oblong pieces* 
and the outer iskin shaved off. 

Pickled Plums.—For eight pounds of fruit take four 
pounds of sugar, one quart of vinegar, one ounce of cinna- 
mon, and one of cloves; scald the vinegar, sugar, and spices 
together; skim, pour scalding hot over the fruit, and let it 
stand three days; pour off the syrup, scald and skim, and 
pour over again, and continue this process every three days 
till they are scalded three times. The plums should? be 
pricked with a needle before dropping into the syrup. 

Quince Pickles.— Peel tj^e quinces and divide inte 
eighths reserving cores and parings for jelly. Put tho 
sections into a preser\ ing kettle on the back of the range , 
with water enough to keep them from burning. Cover, and 
let the fruit steam tiJl tender, then throw in three-fourths 
its weight of sugar. Weigh again, when the sugar is dis- 
solved, and to every four pounds and a half of fruit, allow 
one-half pint of vinegar and one tablespoonful of mixed 
cinnamon and mace tied in a cheese-cloth bag. Cover 
closely and let it simmer fifteen minutes. Skim the fruit 
into glass jars, boil the syrup till it thickens, pour over the 
quinces and seal. 

Raisins Pickled. -Make a syrup ot two pounds of the 
best brown sugar and one pint of vinegar, with a teaspoon- 
f ul each of cinnamon, spice and cloves tied iu a bag. Heat 
to tho boiling point, skim, and turn it over two pounds of 
large selecte4 ^^sjus QU tbeir stei|i»s, On the ^eco|i<l day. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 237 

drain oft the syrup and re heat, put in the raisins and let 
them soak in the hot syrup, kept just below the boiling 
point, till they are tender. Keep in stone or glass. They 
are good without the spices, which to some tasteg are no ad- 
dition to the flavor. This makes a very delicate pickle. 

Nasturtium-seed. -Take the green seeds after the flow- 
er has dried off, but before they are ripe and hard. Lay in 
salt and water two days, in cold water one day; pack in 
bottles and cover with scalding vinegar, seasoned with 
mace and white pepper-corns, and sweetened slightly with 
white sugar. Cork, and set away four weeks before using 
them. They are an excellent substitute for capers. 

Pickled Butternuts and Walnuts.— Gather them 
when soft enough to be pierced by a pin. Lay them in 
strong brine Ave days, changing this twice in the mean- 
time. Drain, and wipe them with a coarse cloth; pierce 
each by running a large needle through it, and lay in cold 
water for six hours. To each gallon of vinegar allow a cup 
of sugar, three dozen each of whole cloves and black pep- 
per corns, half as much allspice, and a dozen blades of 
mace. Boil five minutes; pack the nuts in small jars and 
pour over them scalding hot. Repeat this twice within a 
week; tie up and set away. They will be good to eat in a 
month. 



FRUIT CATSUPS. 

Gooseberry Catsup.— To twelve pounds of stemmed and 
clipped gooseberries add eight pounds of brown sugar, one 
tables ^K>onful of cinnamon, and other spices to taste, in- 
cluding one teaspoonlful of cayenne. Boil two hours, add a 
quart of good vinegar, strain, and bottle. 

Grape Catsup, No. 1.— Simmer three quarts of grapes 
till they are soft, then mash through a colander. Add two

ble.ypoonful8 each of cloves, allspice and cinnamon, one 
tea spoonful of salt, and one of cayenne pepper. Boil till it 
thickens, then bottle. 

Grape Catsup, No. 2.— Squeeze the pulp from ten 
pounds of grapes, boil it five minutes, and strain out tne 
seeds. Throw skins into one pint of vinegar, cover closely, 
and boil till tender; tie in a bag one scant tablespoonful of 
allspice, and a heapinja: tablespoonful of cinnamon and of 
cloves, a teaspoonful of salt, and one of cayenne. Add two 
quarts brown sugar, heat and bottle. 

Plum Catsup. — Pour one pint of hot water over seven 
pounds of plums, cover closeiy and steam till tender. Then 
a* d fv ur pounds brown sugar, one pint good vinegar, and 
one even tablespoonful each of cinnamon, allspice and 
cloves, and two thirds of a teaspoonf id of cayenne. Cover, 
and steep half and hour, then seal in cans. Before serving 
them in a pickle dish take out the pits. 



FRUIT SALAD. 

In summer-time, fruit salads form a cool and delicious 
adjunct of luncheon or ditmer. A few years ago a salad 
consisted of " uncooked herbs, dressed with salt, vinegar 
and spices," but at pres^^nt, tl le word has outgrown that 
definition, especially in adding fruit to the hst of edibles. 
Berries, bananas, peaches, pearp, currants, pineapples, or- 
anges and lemons are all served as salads. Mrs. Emma 
P. Swing's comprehensiv e little lx)ok, entitled " Salads and 
Salad Making," describes minutely the process of making 
simple and compound dressing, which, however, is not 
perplexing work. A judicious mixture of fruits and juices 
depends upon natural taste. Like fruit cream, the salad 
should stand an hour or two in a cool place before it is 



MISCELLANEOUS. 229 

served, in order to acquire that blending or "ripening" of 
flavors which produces a perfect result. 

The simplest of all salads is the ripe currant sprinkled 
with sugar, then currants and raspberries tpgether, then 
oranges and bananas sliced and dressed with lemon juice 
and sugar. 

Apple Salad.— Peel and slice tart mellow apples, sprink- 
le with sugar a,» d the juice of an orange or a lemon. A 
coarser taste will mingle the apple with a few thin slices of 
a raw mild onioji, a dessert-spoonful of oil. in which is min- 
gled a trace of cayenne, and a teaspoonf ul of lemon juice. 

Aguacates or Allig^ator Pear Salad.— This tropical 
fruit which can be procured in the large cities is made into 
a salad by cutting the fruit in two lengthwise, removing 
the rind and large seeds, and dressing it with oil, vinegar, 
pepper and salt; as the pear is itself rich in oil that ingredi- 
ent may be dispensed with. 

Banana Salad.— Peel and cut in slices six bananas, 
peel the same u umber of oranges, and remove the white 
incerior rind, then slice across the orange, removing the pits. 
Arrange them in layers, sprinkle with powdered sugar and 
over them squeeze the juice of a large lemon. 

Compound Fruit Salad.— Peel one pine-apple and 
shred it in small i^lecee with a silver fork, peel and slice thin 
six bananas, and peel, tear into sections, and seed four sour 
oranges. Arrange in a crystal dish in layers, sprinkling 
sugar between them, then squeeze over the whole the juice 
of one large or two small lemons. Prepare two or three 
hours before serving. 

Or over the same combination of fruit pour the following 
from Mrs. Ewing: 

Transparent Orange Dressingr. -To the juice of three 
oranges and one lemon, which should make half a pint, 



230 PBUrrs AKD HOW TO tJSE TflEM. 

add four ounces of suo^ar and the white and Hhell of one 
egg. Beat all together. Heat to the boiling point. Sim- 
mer five minutes and strain. If liked, a small portion of 
the grated peel of both orange and lemon may be added. 

A jellied orange dressing may be made by adding to the 
above mixture before heating it, half an ounce of gelatine 
soaked an hour in a gill of cold water. 

The above excellent dressing will be found fitted for 
various kinds of fruits, such as oranges and banana, peeled, 
sliced and piled in alternate layers. The jellied dressing 
may be molded with layers of small fruit, or with large 
fruit sliced. It should be kept on ice till served. 

(To the orange dressing given above, Mrs. E wing adds 
one gill of sherry wine for which can be substituted simple 
orange juice.) 

Orange Salad.— In India oranges are often served with 
a dressing of oil, vinegar and pepper. A better way is to 
squeeze lemon juice over the sUces and sprinkle liberally 
with powdered sugar. 



HOW TO KEEP FRUITS. 

Stone fruits should be allowed to reach perfect maturity 
or within a few days of that period, before being gathered. 
The same is true of all kinds of berries which hegia to 
lose their value from the hour they are plucked. 

Grapes should be perfectly ripe. Summer pears ought 
to be gathered one or two weeks before maturity, other- 
wise they are mealy and worthless. Cover them with flan- 
nel and store in a dark closet until they have undergone 
that mysterious chemical change which sweetens their 
juices. Summer apples, likewise, should be plucked be- 
fore they are quite rij)e. Winter pears and apples ought 
to remain on the tree till near frost. 



MlSCELLAOTiOtJS. S81 

Fine winter apples ought to be hand-picked and careful- 
ly packed in barrels under the trees to cure, then removed 
to a dry, cool cellar, and kept just above the freezing point. 
They may be packed in dry sand, rejecting any that have 
the slightest appearance of decay, or wrap each apple sep- 
arately in a piece of thin paper, such as is used around 
oranges. By following this method, they will keep till 
June. 

Plums, pears, peaches, apricots and nectarines need to 
be kept in a cool place, with a free circulation of air, and 
should not touch each other. Frequently looking over all 
kinds of fruit and rejecting any that show the slightest 
symptoms of deca}^, w'ill aid in the preservation of the re- 
mainder. Here, as elsewhere, evil communicatic^ns corrupt 
good manners. 

Berries and cherries should be spread out and exposed 
to the circulation of the cool air as much as possible. In 
the same way treat oranges and lemons. The latter may 
be preserved several weeks, when shriveling up in hot 
weather, by keeping in glass jars filled with cold water. 
Change the water every week. Cranberries may be kept 
in the same way. 

Since canning became general dried fruits are less in 
favor than before. Evaporated fruits are excellent. Dried 
cherries have been used in Germany since time immemo- 
rial. They are stewed in water and thickened with flour to 
make a soup for the beginning or the close of dinner. Date 
paste, consisting of ripe fruit pressed into a cake, forms 
a staple food for the Arabs ten months of the year, show- 
ing the excellent properties contained in dried fruits. 
These dateB are boiled and stewed with butter or honey.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 

In all the recipes in " Fruits and How to Use Them/' 
salt is omitted nimply because any housekeeper knows 
how much or how little she wishes to use, better than any 
one can direct. Some fruits, like the apple, have an accent- 
uated flavor by the addition of a trifle of salt, others are 
injured. 

It must be djstinct?y understood that in the use of sugar, 
one pint is equivalent to one pound, that one cupful means, 
more than one teacupful, viz : one-half pint. It takes one 
heaping pint of powdered sugar, howevei, to make one 
pound. By a tablespoonful of any ingredient is moant

HOW TO SEK7E FRUIT. 

Very mucb of the beaut f of fruit depends upon the man- 
ner in which it Is put upon the table* To persons of re- 
finement an esthetic service adds greatly to the enjoyment 
of ail kinds of food, certainly of fruit. 

Apples ought to be well polished with a cloth and piled 
in a high dish, jellovv and red together, with a silver knife 
at each plate. Steel knives ought never to l)e used with 
fiTjit, since they produce discoloration. 

Bananas ought to be heaped with oranges or grapes in a 
high dish of porcelain oi* cr3'stal. 

Berries should be freshly arranged in a large holder and 
served without sugar, which draws out the juice and t')ugh- 
ens them. Each person can use sugar and cream accord- 
ing to his own taste. 

From clusters of grapes clip all that are unsound or un- 
j-ipe, and loy them tenderly' upon a bed of their own green 
leaves. The various shades of pui^le and translucent- 
gi*een, are lovely when arranged together or with golden 
oranges gleaming between the clu st^rs. Grape scissors are 
now frequently placed beside each dessert plate. 

Melons should be kept on ice or in a cool cellar a few 
hours before using. Water -me ions ought to be brought 
to the table entire, and cut across the middle, on a platter, 
with a carving knife. Nutmeg and musk-melons ought to 
be divided lengthwise and brought to the table, after the 
seeds are scooped out, with a lump of ice in each hemi-

sphere. Cut in long strips and pass round both salt and 
sugar. Have knife, fork and teaspoon at each plate. 

The serving of oranges is described under the heading 
" Oranges," among the recipes. 

Peaches should be peeled thin and sliced, but a few of 
the finest ought to be leserved for a central dish since 
many persons prefer to peel their own fruit. A few gre^j^n 
leaves about the edge of the dish help to bring out their 
velvet loveliness. 

Pears should be served in a high dish with green leaves. 
Plums, the purple and green gage, have their coloring en- 
hanced by a few sprajs of the nasturtium, leaves and blos- 
soms together. In fact the lovers of the beautiful, always 
fertile in resource, will devise a hundred different ways of 
arranging fruit as a table decoration. 



CONCLUDINO NOTES. 

"While it has been the aim, in the preceding pages, to 
present a tolerably complete list of recipes for the prepara- 
tion of table fruits, it is most earnestly recommended, in 
the interest of good health, that the housekeeper should 
confine herself to the simpler forms. Among them there 
can certainly be found a sufficient variety to satisfy the 
most fastidious and exacting, 

"Fruits and How to Us3 Them" is not claimed to be an 
exhaustive work. The permutations to be rung upon this 
important food are practically endless. 

During the last sis years the author and compiler, in 
the interest of this book, has consulted many private house-

books), to i\M of whom she returns grateful thanks.

keepers will make pies and hoasohohlers will eat thorn. 
Following are some healthful ways of maldng plain pastry. 

Plain Pastry.— Mix together equal quantities of 
Graham and white flour and wet witli cohi sweet cream, in 
the proportion of three cups of flour to on« scant cup of 
cream. Stir it with a spoon rapidly ami lightly. Without 
kneading, gather the dough with the fingers and set in a 
very cool place half an hour before rolling out. 

Two rounding teaspoonfuls of baking-powder will make 
this crust still lighter. In that case roll and hake at once. 

Again, take equal quantities of white pastry flour, Indian 
meal and oat-meal and wet with cream as above directed. 
It should in all cases be rolled thin, for the pastry is only 
needed as an envelope for the fruit. 

Plain Butter Paste. -Rub one pound of flour into a 
smooth, thick paste with ice cold water, roll it out and 
weigh out cme quarter of a pound of good butter, which 
should be divided into three equal portions. Spread the 
paste with dots of butter, sprinkle on a trifle of flour, roll it 
over and roll out Dot it a second time with butter and 
yet a third, touching it with the hand** as little as possible- 
Set in the ice-box a few minutes, then roll and bake. 

Good tarts or pies can be made with this pastry it the 
lower crust is filled with clean linen rags; then cover with 



23fi FitUITS AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

the upper crust and bake. Take off the top, pour in fresh 
fruit mashed and sweetened., cover with a little sweet cream, 
replace the crust and serve. 

In all cases, in the recipes, where " spoonfuly," either 
laige or sma 1 are mentioned, rounded spoonfuls are meant, 
not heaped. 

This Httle book will fulfill its mission if it satisfies a few 
housekeepers that the shedding of blood and ba(irifice of 
animal life, especially in the summer season, is not neces- 
sary in order to furnish a table both wholesome and at- 
tractive. In the long list of excellent cook books now at 
hand, with " Marion Hailand's Common Sense in the House- 
hold" at the head, prevails a mixed dietary in which fruits 
have not received a recognition of that value which will be 
accorded to them in the civilization of the future. This is 
due to the fact that even two years ago fruits were to be 
found in the market less plentifully than they are to-day, 
and also that they were less luscious and easily preserved. 
As a courier of far gi'eater prodigahty and richness on the 
part of Nature's choice productions, " How to use Fruits" 
presents its modest claims.

Healthfal and FalataUc. 

The most important question with all interested and 
intelligent housekeepers should be ^^ What can I pre- 
pare for my table that will be Healthful and Palata- 
ble?" The world is full of Cook Books and Receipt 
Books, but in nearly every case not the slightest atten- 
tion is given to the health and strength giving quahties 
of the dishes described, and a large part of the direc- 
tions are useless (for never followed) and in many cases 
harmful (if tried). 

What is needed is a practical work in which these 
condivions are carefully considered and one which is 
simple enough to be easily understood. 

A recent pubUcation, Health in the Household, 
by Dr. S. W. Dodd, a lady physician and a practical 
housekeeper, covers this ground very fully and can be 
recommended. It considers the value of the different 
food products, the best methods of preparation, and the 
^pason why. 

The Chicago Inter-Ocean says : *' She evidently knows what she is 
vmting about and her book is emineutly practical upon every page. 1% 
is more than a book of receipes for making soups, and pies, and cakes ; 
it 18 an educator of how to make the home the abode of healthful peo- 
ple." 

** She sets forth the why and wherefore of cookery, and devotes 
the larger portion of the work to those articles essential to good blood, 
strong bodies, and vigorous m nds," says The New ffa/oen Begister. 

Housekeep< rs who consult this will be able to provide 
for the household that which will positively please and 
increase the happiness by increasing the healthful con- 
ditions. 

It contains 600 large pages, bound in extra cloth ox 
oil clothpbinding, and is sold at $2. Sent by mail or ex-

The author of this work is specially qualified for her task, as she is botK 
b physician and a practical housekeeper. It is unquestionably the best 
work ever written on the healthful preparation of food, and should be in 
the hands of every housekeeper who wishes to prepare food healthfully and 
palatably. The best way and the reason why are given. It is complete in 
every department. To show something of what is thought of this work, we 
copy a few brief extracts from the many 

NOTICfilS OF THF PRESS. 

"This work contains a good deal of excellent advicd about wholesome food, r**'? 
gives directions for preparing many dishes in a way that will make luzaries for tiie 
palate oat of many simple prvaactions of Nature which are now lost by a vicious cook- 
ery."— £fom« Journal. 

** Another book on cookery, and one that appears to be ftilly the equal in all respect^, 
and superior to many of its predeceasorn. Simplicity is sought to be blended with 
science, economy with all the enjoyments bf the table, and health and happiness with an 
ample household liberality. Every pun»e and every taste will find in Mrs. Dodds* book, 
material within its means of grasp for efftcient kitchea administration."— iV. Y. Star. 

"The book can not fail to be of great value in every household to those wjo will in- 
telligently appreciate the anthor^s stand-poiat. And there are but few who will not ooq- 
cede that it would be a public benefit if our people gen erallv would become better m* 
formed as to the better mode of living than the author intend*.''— Scientijlc American. 

*'She evidently kno\^s what she is writing about, and her book is eminently practi- 
cal upon every page. It is more than a book of recipes for making ponps, and pics, and 
cake ; it is an educator^f how to make the home the abode of healthful people."— TA^ 
Uailu Inter- Ocean, Chicago, 111. 

'^ The book is a good one, and should be given a place in every well-regulated cuIHm.'* 
'-Indianapolis Journal. 

" As a compreheudive work on the subject of healthfal cookery, there is no other In 
print which is superior, and which brings the subject so clearly and squarely to the un- 
derstanding of an average housekeeper/'— if €^Aorfi*< Beoorder, 

*'In this book Dr. Dodds deals with the whole subject scientifically, and yet has 
made her instructions entirely practical. Tbe book will certainly prove useful, and if 
it!< precepts could be univer-=ally followed, without doubt human life would be consider- 
ably lengthened."— )S5pri/}a/Ie;rf Union. 

" Here is a cook-book prepared by an educated lady physician. It seems to be a 
very sen&ible addition to the voluminous literature on this subject, which ordinarily has 
lirtlereiprence to the hygienic character 01 the preparations which are described." — 
Zion's Herald. 

** This one seems to us to be most sensible and practical, while yet ba«ed upon scien- 
tific principles— in short, the best. If it were in every hou&ehoid, there would be far less 
misti-y in tne world."— 5otf/A and West. 

" Tliere is much good pense in the book, and there is plenty of occasion for attacking 
the orc'iuary methods of cookini;, as well as the common t\y\e of diet."— Ifomi.nflr Star.

THE LABYRINTH. 



A STORY WORTH READING. 
About Human Nature. 

We have recently published a vol- 
ume containing a story of Human 
Nature which will be found of in- 
terest. It is called ** The Man Won- 
derful in the House Beautiful," 
and is an allegory, teaching the 
principles of Physiology and Hy- 
giene, and the effects of Stimulants 
and Narcotics. The House is the 
Body, in which the Foundations are 
the Bones, the Walls are Muscles, 
the Skin and Hair the Siding and 
Shingles, the head an Observatory 
in which are found a pair of Tele- 
scopes, and radiating from it are the nerves which are compared 
to a Telegraph, while communications are kept up with the 
Kitchen, Dining-room, Pantry, Laundry, etc. The House is 
heated with a Furnace. There are also Mysterious Chambei»s, 
and the whole is protected by a Burglar Alarm. In studying tlie 
inhabitant of the House, the ** Man Wonderful,'* we learn of his 
growth, development, and habits of the guests whom he in- 
troduces. He finds that some of them are friends, others are 
doubtful acquaintances, and some decidedly wicked. Under this 
form, we ascertain the effects of Food and Drink, Narcotics and 
Stimulants. 

It is a wonderful book, and placed in the hands of children 
will lead them to the study of Physiology and Hygiene, and the 
Laws of Life and Health in a way that will never be forgotten. 
The book will prove of great interest even to adults and those 
familiar with the subject. The authors, Drs. C. B. and Mary A. 
Allen, are both regular physicians, and therefore the work is ac- 
curate and on a scientific basis. ** Science in Story" has never 
been presented in a more attractive form. It is universally ad- 
mitted that a large proportion of sickness comes from violations 
of the laws of Life and Health, and therefore it is important that 
this subject should be understood by all, as in this way we may 
become familiar with all the avoidable causes of disease. The 
reading of this book will very largely accomplish this end. It 
will be sent securely by mail, prepaid, on receipt of price, which is 
only $1.50. Address

THE MAN WONDERFUL MANIKIN. 

The Study of Phy- 
siology and the Laws 
ofHealth is of thegreat- 
est importance, and in 
many of the States it is 
required in the public 
schools. As an aid to 
this there are many 
charts and maps pub- 
lished, but notliing, ex- 
cept very costly mani- 
kins, that have been 
satisfactory until we 
made the 

''ManWonderfur 
Manikin 

which is shown in this 
illustration. It stands 
erect and is one third 
the size of life and so 
opens up or dissects as 
to show more than fifty 
views of the body, only 
a small part of whicjfi 
are seen in the illus- 
tration given. It is 
very attractive and 
nothing in any way 
objectionable is pre- 
sented. It should be not 
only in every school 
but in every home, and 
we have sfit a price on 
it which will enable all 
to obtain it. With Man- 
ual, only $5.00 (net). As a special inducement or premium to all who 
send 50 cents extra with their order, which but a little more than pays 
express charges, we will send it prepaid with copv of ^^THE MAK

GsinueifBii :— I have read ** For Girb" with cm. and fed penooaTy obliged to 
h» author for writm^ a book that is Tery much needed, and that mothen not onl> 
na, but ought to pla^e a the hands of their daughters. Mrs. Siimberd has executed 
i difficult t2^ with judgioent and discretion. She has said man j things which motheit 
Snd it difficult to sa/ to their daughters, unless forced bj some art or drcumstanoe^ 
#hich alas, maj prove their warmng coines too late. ** For Girls** is free from thi 
vices of most worics of its kind, it is neither preachj nor didactic. It talks freely and 
familiarly with theae it is written to benefit, and some of its counsels would be at well 
heeded }aj our boys, at our girls. Req>ectf uUy youn, 

Mrs. J. C Cbolt. 

Mrs. Caroline a Winslow, U.D.. of Washington, D. C, in an editorial in tht 
dtpha^ says : ** It is abook we most heartily and unreservedly recommend to parents, 
guardians, and friends of voung ^;irls to put in the bands of their daughters and theii 
wards. It fuUy supplies a ion? existing need, and completes the instruction ordinarily 
given in physiolo^ in our high-schoob and seminaries. This bocdc is rendered 
more valuaole ancl important, as it treats with perfect freedom, and in a wise, 
ihaste, and dignified manner, subjects that are entirely neglected by most teachers ol 

dopular physiology None but a woman with a oy^alline intellect, and a pun 

Vmng heart, coi^ have written this dean, thoughtful, and simply scientific description 
of our sexual system, and our moral obligation to studv it thoroughly, and guud it 
fiom any impurity of thought or act, from injury through ignorance, abuse, or m ..iiit& 
It has won our entire and hearty apprc»-id, and enlists us at a champion and friend, 
to do all in our power for its sale, not for the pecuniary compensation of its author, but 
more for the lasting good of our giris, who are to be the teachers, wives, mothers, and 
leaders, after we have laid aside our armor and nave entered !nto rest." 

Drs. S. W. & Mary Dodds, physicians, with a large practice in St Louis, Ma, say \ 
"The book * For Giris,* which we have carefully exa min ed, is a valuable work, mudi 
needed, and it is difficult to say whether the daughters or their mothers would be moat 
benefited by a perusal of it. You will no doubt find ready sale for it, all the morei ai 
there is haidly another book yet published that would take the place of it** 

MaiT Jeweit Telford, of Denver, Colorado, says : **MrB. Shepherd has earned the 
ftle of *ap08tle to the girls.' No careful mothv need hesiute to place this little bool 
n her daughter's hands, and the probabilities are that she will herself learn some h«^ 
hil lessons by reading it While there is no attempt made to solve all the mysterlM 
of being, wliat eveiy girl ought to know of her own organism, and the care of what If 
3D 'feanully and wonderful^ made,* is here treated in a manner at oooe practical, 
iModest, sensible, and reverent" 

fke Fkretuhgical Jcummi says: ** A book designed for girit should be written by 
i woman to be perfect ; it being undentood as a matter of course that she possessm p 
Uiorough familiarity with the subject she discusses. The author of this boox indicate: 
10 unusual acqiaintance with the anatomy and physidogy of the feminine organise* 
Qon, also a ready acquaintance with the other phases of social relationship belonging 
*£ woman in her eveiy-day life ; with a more than common discrimination m gleaning 
just such macerial from general professional experience as is best adapted to na pnr 
poses. The style of tne book is clear, simply colloquial and has nothing gansh 
DTuiish, or mori>id about it. It is bright without being flippant in thought, agreeable 
reading without awakening anything of the sensual or exciting. It conctmstht bealtl. 
fulness and the well-being of the girls who are soon to become wives and motheis of tin 
irorid. There is no doubt but what many of the seeds of diseases in women are sowo4 
^ girlhood, and therefore this bocdc should be placed in the hands of fverv WMmf 
, and of ?verv mother of a daughter in the land.**
