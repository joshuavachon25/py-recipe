INTRODUCTION 



" Paper-Bag Cookery " is the method of cooking food in 
a hot oven, having previously enveloped each article in 
paper, and thus cooking them in hot air and in the steam 
generated by their own juices. The method is fully ex- 
plained and its advantages are clearly and incontestably 
set out in the following pages, but it may be well to sum 
up the latter succinctly in their order here that they may 
be taken in at a glance. 

The greatest advantage of all is, of course, the great 
improvement in flavour and the retention in the food of 
its highest nutritive properties. 

(1) Food cooked in a paper bag is superior in flavour 

and of higher nutritive value than that cooked 
in any other way. 

The next advantage is its economy in time, in money, 
and in labour. 

(2) Food cooked in a paper bag loses practically nothing 

in weight. 

(3) By cooking the entire dinner in paper bags in the 

oven an immense saving in fuel is effected. 

(4) Food cooked in a paper bag takes, as a rale, a much 

shorter time to cook than when cooked by any 
other method. 

(5) The entire meal may be prepared and placed in the 

bags overnight, thus saving considerable time 
during the busy morning hours. 



6 INTRODUCTION 

(6) Joints require no basting, and provided care is taken 

to lower the gas sufficiently to prevent scorching 
the bags, the food can be left to look after itself 
until the proper time for dishing up arrives. 

A very great advantage both to mistress and maid is 
the cleanliness of the process. It is undoubtedly an advan- 
tage when doing without a servant to have no pots and 
pans to soil one's fingers, or to roughen one's hands with 
the necessary strong soda water for cleansing kitchen 
utensils. 

(7) No pots and pans to clean. No blackened saucepans 

to scour ; no dishcloths to wash out, after washing 
the pots, thus saving soap and soda. The bags 
used in cooking are merely burned up. 

(8) No constant and expensive renewal of pots, baking 

dishes, fireproof ware — frequently far from fire- 
proof — tin saucepans burned through in no time 
— enamelled dishes from which the enamel so 
soon wears off. An ample supply of paper bags 
* for an average family will cost at the utmost no 
more than sixpence per week. 

(9) Comfort in kitchen and sitting-room. There is 

absolutely no smell of cooking during the pre- 
paration of meals, a very great advantage in houses 
where the kitchen is not completely shut off 
from the rest of the house. 

(10) It is possible to cook all sorts of viands at the same 

time in paper bags. Even such articles as fish, 
onions, etc., can be cooked at the same time 
as the most delicate foods without impairing their 
flavour or imparting their own. 

(11) Freedom from grease. Many dishes which are too 

rich for the digestion when cooked in the usual 
way may be put into a paper bag with no more 
butter than is necessary to grease the bag, and 



INTRODUCTION 7 

will be found to have gained in savour and delicacy 
of taste, while so completely free from grease 
that they will not disagree with the most delicate 
digestion. 

(12) Meat is made tender by being cooked in a paper 
bag. Even if inclined to be tough, the same 
joint that, put into an oven and cooked in the 
usual way, would be almost uneatable, will, cooked 
in a paper bag, turn out surprisingly tender and 
palatable. The envelope keeps all the juices in, 
and thus enables the meat to be cooked to per- 
fection. 

(IS) The juices which must in some degree run from 
meat, the syrup jvhich may boil out from the fruit 
dumpling, the gravy which may exude from the 
meat pudding, are all preserved in the bag, instead 
of being lost in the baking dish or the boiling 
water, as would be the case if the bag were dis- 
pensed with. 

(14) No scrubbing out of a greasy oven with dripping 

clinging to the sides ; no washing out of the 
dripping pan or baking dish. A spotlessly clean 
oven is left, and when the bags have been burned 
up and the dishes washed, the cook's labours in 
connection with the finished meal are over. 

(15) Even such articles which for some reason or other 

must necessarily be put into dishes, are immensely 
improved in flavour by being afterwards placed 
in a paper bag, and are also more equally cooked 
well as saved from all risk of burning.

PAPER-BAG COOKERY 



CHAPTEE I. 

SHOWING THE ENORMOUS ADVANTAGES OP 
COOKING IN PAPER-BAGS OVER THE PRE- 
SENT METHOD. 

When Primitive Man first ventured on the daring experi- 
ment of applying heat to his newly-slain prey, he would 
most naturally adopt the obvious plan of suspending it on 
three sticks over a fire. The result, though no doubt to a 
certain extent tasty, would be smoked, charred on one side, 
raw on the other, and this, coupled with the frequency of 
burned fingers gained while rescuing the meat from the 
fire into which it fell when the sticks burned through, 
caused Primitive Man — or, more probably, Primitive 
Woman — to evolve the method of cooking known to us 
to-day as Paper-bag Cookery. 

Paper not having been discovered, the prehistoric 
cook could not use the bags now placed at our disposal, 
but a very fair substitute was always ready to hand in the 
shape of green leaves, in which the meat was carefully 
wrapped. A hole was dug in the ground, and partly filled 
with large stones, on the top of which a fire was kindled. 
When it had burned out, the stones would be almost red- 
hot, and the meat, wrapped in the green leaves, was laid 
in, some of the hot stones being raked over the parcel, 
and then the hole was filled in with earth, so that neither 
smoke nor steam could escape. In fifteen minutes or so, 



10 PAPEB-BAG COOKERY 

or as near that time as Primitive Man could restrain his 
hunger, the meat would be done to a turn, and the hungry 
family would break open their primitive cooking oven, 
and devour the delicious morsels. 

From Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle we learn that the 
Tahitians cooked their food at that date (1835) in precisely 
the same way, and those of us who have revelled in childhood 
in Bill Biddon, The Trapper, and other Indian stories, must 
remember the delightful feasts described in those books, 
where the hunters and their friends gathered round the 
camp fire at night, and ate buffalo meat and wild prairie 
birds in the same fashion. How much more delicious 
to the childish mind than the commonplace roast mutton 
of nursery dinners. In spite of the condescending ex- 
planations given by our elders that it was only the hunger 
of the hunters that made such cookery palatable, the child 
still believes in the delights of such a meal — and the child 
is right ! 

There is no method of cooking by which the flavour 
is so well brought out, and the juices so well preserved, 
as by cooking in this way ; that is, by hot air surrounding 
the food, which is thus cooked in its own juices, and by 
the steam so generated. 

Paper-Bag Cookery is not a mere craze of the moment ; 
for once its advantages have been discovered, it will 
become firmly rooted as one of the best and most economi- 
cal means of preparing food ever invented. Why it should 
have fallen into abeyance among civilised nations (except 
in the cooking of one or two special dishes) for so many 
centuries is impossible to surmise. 

NO LOSS OF WEIGHT OR FLAVOUR. 

One very great advantage of paper-bag cookery which 
will appeal strongly to the economist is the fact that meat 
thus treated loses little or nothing of its weight. To the 
great grief of the thrifty housewife, there is no way of 
preventing the lordly and expensive sirloin of beef or the 
dainty leg of lamb losing very considerably in its passage 



ADVANTAGES OVEE PKESENT METHODS 11 

through the cooking process, and when one has paid a 
good price per pound for the meat, one certainly grudges 
losing even a few ounces of it. 

In boiling meat less is lost, but even that little is mourned 
by the thrifty soul, and stews are recommended, because 
what is lost in the cooking goes to enrich the gravy and 
vegetables in the stewpan. 

But stews, though nourishing and economical, are not 
savoury, and the thrifty housewife will rejoice to know 
that by placing her joint in a paper bag, her family may 
enjoy the savour and tastiness of roast meat, without the 
waste in the cooking. As the joint goes into the oven, so 
it comes out, the same weight, or, if in some instances 
there be some difference, it is so slight as to be infinitesimal. 

Economy, however, is not everything, and paper-bag 
cookery appeals also to the epicure, who does not consider 
cost in ordering a meal to his taste. 

Food cooked in a paper bag acquires a richness and a 
delicacy of flavour imparted by no other means of cooking. 
All the juices of the meat are preserved ; there is no 
greasiness, no dryness, no risk of burning ; even tough 
meat is made tender. Until a joint cooked by this method 
has been tasted, the epicure has no idea of the exquisite 
flavour and delicacy which await him. 

HOW IT HELPS THE HOUSEKEEPER 
ON SMALL MEANS. 

Quails, puff pastry, turbot, and salmon are all very well 
in their way, and it is gratifying to the wealthy epicure 
to know that to cook them in paper bags is to attain per- 
fection ; but there are many of us to whose limited incomes 
these dishes are quite unattainable luxuries, and who are 
more interested in knowing how to cook simple and cheap 
articles of food to advantage. 

It is to these anxious housewives with limited purses that 
paper-bag cookery specially appeals ; kippers, bloaters, 
and smoked haddocks are simple and cheap food, used 
every day as breakfast and supper dishes by those whose 



12 PAPER-BAG COOKEEY 

incomes oblige them to be careful in their expenditure. 
Excellent as these articles are, there are few more easily- 
spoiled. They burn easily, and dry up very much in frying. 
A moment's neglect, and a burned, unpalatable, tasteless 
object is all that emerges from the frying-pan. 

Cooked in a paper bag, however, there is no such danger 
and no one need fear to lose the savoury relish that a well 
cooked kipper or bloater possesses. They are just as 
tasty, but have acquired a flavour unsurpassed by any 
other method of cooking. The juices are preserved, and 
there is no fear of dryness. Place a kipper, bloater, or 
smoked haddock cooked in a paper bag before a lover of 
these fish, and he will discover new charms in his favourite 
dish. 

No one can deny, however, that appetising as these 
homely fish are, the smell of frying kippers or bloaters is 
most aggressive. Not content with rilling the house, it 
forces its way into the street, and triumphantly proclaims 
to our neighbours upon what humble fare we are feasting. 
But cooked in a " Papakuk Bag," there is absolutely no 
smell to reveal the nature of the coming repast, and as 
many people dislike very much the smell of the food they 
are about to eat, and, indeed, complain that the smell takes 
away their appetite completely, this in itself is a great 
gain. 

THE PROPER BAGS TO USE. 

Red mullet, cutlets, and one or two other dainties have 
always been cooked in paper (ordinary kitchen paper, 
thoroughly oiled), and it seems strange that the delicious 
flavour thus obtained did not earlier stimulate some obser- 
vant and enterprising chef to apply the principle to other 
foods. But now that attention has been drawn to the 
matter, many of our best known chefs are strongly urging 
the use of paper bags. Joints of meat can be cooked by 
wrapping in sheets of kitchen paper, carefully secured to 
envelope the meat entirely, and exclude the air, but for 
other food bags are essential. 

Let no thrifty soul think to economise by saving for 



ADVANTAGES OVER PRESENT METHODS 13 

this use the bags in which articles have been sent home 
from grocers, greengrocers, or other tradesmen. This 
plan would be an excellent illustration of the proverb, 
" Penny wise and pound foolish," for though a few pence 
might be saved, the spoiling of the food would be a much 
more serious expense. Cooked in these bags, everything 
would taste unpleasantly of paper, even if the cooking were 
otherwise successfully carried out. 

A much graver matter would be the danger to health. 
The paper, not manufactured for cooking purposes, might 
have something injurious in its composition, or the paste 
used in joining the bags might contain some harmful 
substance, so that a doctor's bill would make the cost of 
the bags got without payment far in excess of those manu- 
factured for the purpose, and sold for a very small sum. 



HOW THE BAGS SHOULD BE FASTENED. 

When the food has been placed in the bags, the openings 
must, of course, be secured, for the whole essence of this 
method lies in the complete exclusion of the air, and the 




CLIPS

HOW TO FIX THE CLIPS. 
Once the joint is in the paper-bag, the opening to the bag must 
be clipped down. First turn the corners down, as in the first fold, 
then bring the top of the bag over, leaving sloping corners. The 
clips can then be inserted. 

sealing up of the juices and flavour of the food that it may 
cook in its own steam. 

Now, the question is, how to fasten the food in the bag 
in the most secure manner. Clips can be obtained with 
the bags, and these are excellent. Safety-pins are not 
advisable, as they are apt to tear the paper when being 



14 



PAPER-BAG COOKERY 



adjusted. On no account must ordinary pins be used, for 
they are easily overlooked when removing the paper, and 
lying unnoticed on the meat dish, might be conveyed to 
a plate and be inadvertently swallowed. 



GBEASING THE BAGS. 

There is a great difference of opinion about this, some 
cooks greasing each bag inside and outside without any 
regard to what is being cooked ; some grease only in 
special cases, and others do not use grease at all. It is, 
however, quite necessary to freely grease the inside of 
the bags containing fish or pudding, otherwise the food 
will stick to the bag, and although it is not wise to thickly 




To find out whether the food is cooked, just press the bag with 
one finger. If it feels tender, it is quite all right. 

grease one containing a joint, especially a fat joint, yet the 
meat itself should be lightly rubbed over with a morsel 
of dripping or vegetable lard to prevent the paper sticking 
to it. Butter should not be used, as it gives meat a bad 
colour. 

If the bag containing a joint be thickly greased inside 
and out, the interior of the oven will be greasy and will 



ADVANTAGES OVER PRESENT METHODS 15 

smell, thus doing away with two of the benefits of paper- 
bag cookery — cleanliness and freedom from smell. 

THE COOKING OF DIFFERENT DISHES TOGETHER. 

If a joint of meat is being roasted in an oven in the 
ordinary way, nothing else may be cooked at the same 
time, unless it be a Yorkshire pudding or baked potatoes, 
which are placed below the meat expressly to catch the 
dripping and the gravy. 

If the rash cook ventured to put in several articles of 
food at once, disaster would be the result. The tart would 
savour of roast pork, the meat taste of onions, or the baked 
fish would give its own special flavour to everything else 
in the oven. Apart from this, the heat required to cook 
the joint would curdle the milk pudding, and the gentle 
warmth required for the custard would leave the steak 
in an almost raw condition. Then, too, the necessity of 
hanging the joint from the bar at the top of the gas-cooker 
leaves very little room for anything else. 

In paper-bag cookery, the most varied assortment of 
dishes will lie amicably side by side on the grid supplied 
with the gas-cookers, and no mingling of flavours or 
spoiling of one or the other will result. Cooking them thus 
altogether, an immense saving in time and in expense for 
heating is effected. Even the savoury onion will cook 
placidly by the side of a bag of gooseberries, without 
imparting its flavour to the fruit. 

While cooking is going on, the oven door can be freely 
opened without risk of spoiling anything by the admission 
of cold air, which, of course, would be fatal to the contents 
of the oven in ordinary cooking. 

THE CLEANLINESS OF PAPER-BAG COOKERY. 

When dinner has been successfully cooked, dished up, and 
eaten, the labours of the cook are by no means ended, for 
then comes the distasteful business of clearing up. The 
oven must be cleaned while it is still hot, the interior well 
scrubbed out with hot water and soda to free it from the 



16 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

grease which will cause such an unpleasant smell next time 
the oven is used. . The baking tin must next be attended 
to, and then comes the array of saucepans, stewpans, and 
frying-pans which have been used, and which are often 
so difficult to scour that one can understand and almost 
forgive the hard-driven " general " who puts them away 
in a dirty condition, trusting to be able to clean them 
some time before they are again required. In this particu- 
lar, the contrast between paper-bag and ordinary cooking 
is most striking. 

The meat having been cooked in a bag, there is no grease 
to be scrubbed from the oven, and none on the bars of 
the grid where it has lain ; the interior of the cooker is 
perfectly clean ; there is no baking or dripping-pan to be 
cleansed with hot water and plenty of soda ; there are no 
saucepans to scour. 

When the paper bags have been disposed of, there remain 
only the plates, knives, forks, and spoons to wash up, and 
that over, cook may sit down to rest. This, in itself, is 
such an immense saving of labour and time, that the 
mistress who adopts " Papakukery " may be said to have 
gone far towards solving the servant problem. 

THE BEST OVEN TO USE. 

A gas-cooker is undoubtedly the best for paper-bag 
cookery, as the ease with which the heat is regulated, and 
a steady even degree maintained, the little attention it re- 
quires while the food is cooking, make it ideal for all ways 
of preparing food, but especially for the method now under 
consideration. Gas is absolutely perfection for paper-bag 
cookery. But all houses are not supplied with gas, and 
even if they are, the economical housewife may prefer to 
cook by coal fires, at all events in winter, when the kitchen- 
range is alight all day long, or when it is going for the 
purpose of getting hot water for baths. 

An ordinary coal heated kitchen-range will answer very 
well for paper-bag cookery, if a little care and attention be 
given to the matter. The cook must firmly impress on 



ADVANTAGES OVEK PRESENT METHODS 17 

her mind that the bags must not be laid on a solid baking 
sheet, but on a wire grid, which may be cheaply acquired 
at an ironmonger's ; that the oven must be heated to 
220° Fahr. before the food is put into it — a cooking 
thermometer is not an expensive item ; and that, though 
the heat may be lessened after some twenty minutes, the 
fire must not be allowed to go down and then be built up 
again to complete the cookery. 

If the bags are put on a hot baking sheet, the cooking 
will be a failure, because it is necessary for the hot air to 
circulate round the food and completely surround it ; 
besides, the bags will burst as soon as they are laid on 
a hot solid surface. 

When cooking in a gas oven, it must be remembered 
that the gas must be lighted and left full on for ten minutes 




before the food is put in, and also that the lower grid must 
not be put in the lowest groove, or the bags will catch 
fire from being too near the flame. The top grid should be 
put in the groove nearest the top of the oven, if that will 
allow the bags to lie conveniently on it, and the second 
grid as near the first as may be convenient. 



18 



PAPER-BAG COOKERY 



A wire grid from the ironmonger's may be added to the 
two usually supplied with the gas-cooker ; in some ovens 
there is room for two additional ones. After about ten 
to fifteen minutes, the gas may be turned half-way down, 
and this degree of heat steadily maintained till the cooking 
is completed. 

Sometimes, when people are living in apartments, there 
is a supply of gas, but no cooker. In such a case, it would 
be easy to buy a gas ring and tubing to attach it to a gas 
jet. Over the ring a tin oven, such as can be had cheaply 
from most ironmongers, should be placed, and it will be 
found that a paper-bag dinner will emerge most success- 
fully from it. 

Even if nothing more than a paraffin stove is to be had, 
still the paper-bag cook need not despair. Longer time 
will be needed to get the oven placed on top of a paraffin 
stove to the necessary degree of heat, but by remember- 
ing this, and maintaining the same steady heat, paper-bag 
cookery may be managed much more satisfactorily in such 
an oven than ordinary cooking could possibly be. 

A HOME-MADE GRID. 

As a wire grid in the oven is necessary, and many 
housewives may not be able to try the new cooking 




NATURAL 
EDGE 



ADVANTAGES OVEK PRESENT METHODS 19 

because their ovens are not fitted with a grid, here is 
a very cheap and simple way of making a grid that 
will answer perfectly. 

Get a piece of ordinary wire netting, cut it to the 
width of the oven, then thread through the natural 
edge on both sides an iron or brass rod^-a curtain or 
stair rod will do — then place in the oven as shown in 
the sketch. The ends of the rods must rest on the 
little ledge in the oven which usually supports the iron 
shelf, and that will give the necessary strength and 
support to the grid. The total cost should not be 
more than twopence or threepence. 

DISHING-UP. 

At the end of the specified time, a peep into the oven 
will reveal the array of paper bags, probably well browned 
but not burned. If there has been the slightest smell of 
burning paper, it should at once be looked to and the 
gas reduced. 




TO REMOVE THE FOOD FROM THE BAG. 
Let the bag lie on a dish, take a pair of scissors and rip up one 
side of the bag and also one end as shown by the dotted lines. 
Then pull the bag away and the food will remain on the dish. 

A large fish-slice should be employed to remove the 
bag containing the meat from the oven and place it on 
the hot dish ready for it. A pair of scissors should be at 
hand to slit open the bag, which must then be dexterously 
removed, leaving the nicely browned, perfectly cooked 
joint on the dish. There will be very little gravy, as that, 



20 PAPEK-BAG COOKEKY 

of course, is the juice of the meat, and the claim of the 
paper-bag cookery is that it seals up the juices within the 
meat. On no account add water to the few spoonfuls of 
rich, strong gravy in the dish, for that would completely 
spoil the delicious flavour. 

In families where much gravy is desired, it must 
be made separately with a little stock, browned and 
thickened. 

The potatoes can now be turned out of their paper bag 
into a hot dish, and the same process can be followed with 
peas or sprouts. Cauliflower requires gentler handling. 
Its bag should be slit, and the nicely cooked flower — almost 
all green must be cut away — suffered to glide gently into 
a dish filled with hot white sauce ready prepared. The 
pudding may continue in the oven, the gas turned very 
low so that it may keep hot, but not cook any longer, till 
it is required.

HOW TO COOK FISH. 

There is nothing which is so delicious when cooked in 
paper bags as fish. Boiled fish is light and digestible, but 
most of the nutriment and flavour are lost in the water ; 
and although less goes to waste when the fish is steamed 
or cooked in a conservative cooker, there is no comparison 
between these methods and paper-bag cookery. The 
flavour is unsurpassed ; there is no smell of frying or boil- 
ing fat ; no risk of burning ; no spoiling by overcooking ; 
no trouble or fuss looking out the right saucepan and 
bringing the fat to just the right degree of heat ; in short, 
it is the perfection of fish cookery. It is an ideal way of 
cooking small fish or portions of fish. A salmon steak, 
cooked in a paper bag, is an epicure's dream, and no one 
who has not eaten one cooked in this way can form any 
idea of its exquisite flavour. Cod cutlet is a revelation, 
for it acquires a new and delightful flavour, while the 
cheaper and coarser fish, such as hake, rock salmon, monk- 
fish, etc., when treated in this way, gain so much in taste 
as to become real delicacies. 

Skate is particularly nice cooked in a paper bag. This 
fish, though exceedingly wholesome and easily digested, 
has a rather strong flavour, which is objected to by many 
people. Oddly enough, this strong flavour entirely dis- 
appears when the fish is cooked in a paper bag. 

SKATE. 

A piece weighing about a pound should be soaked for 
about an hour in strong salt and water, then shaken free 



22 PAPEK-BAG COOKERY 

from moisture and rubbed over with butter. Season with 
salt and pepper and put into a well greased bag, with 
one tablespoonful of water and half as much vinegar. 
Cook for about eighteen minutes, and serve on a very 
hot dish, on which a slice of butter has been melted. 
This is a capital supper dish. 

SALMON CUTLETS. 

Take a slice of salmon weighing half a pound. Rub 
it over with butter which has been seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and a few drops of lemon juice, and put it into a very 
well greased bag. Have the oven very hot, and cook the 
salmon for fifteen minutes. Slit the bag with scissors, and 
slip the fish on to a very hot dish. This will have all the 
savour of fried salmon, but with a delicious flavour and 
aroma peculiarly its own. If the effect of boiled salmon be 
desired, put a scant half-teacupful of water into the bag 
with the fish. 

FRESH HADDOCK 

is particularly dainty when cooked in this fashion. Have 
the fish cleaned and the head taken off. Rub both inside 
and out with butter, put it into a well greased bag with 
a tablespoonful of water, and cook for fifteen minutes. 
It will have the appearance of a boiled fish, and the curd- 
like whiteness and delicacy of its flesh will be extremely 
tempting, while the flavour will be far superior to that 
of a boiled haddock. Or, if a more savoury dish be pre- 
ferred, the fish must be well dredged with flour, which has 
been highly seasoned with salt and pepper, then covered 
with bits of butter, put without water into a greased 
paper-bag and placed in a hot oven, the heat being main- 
tained at the same degree for twenty minutes. The paper 
will become very brown, but must not be allowed to 
blacken or singe. The fish will then be a rich golden brown, 
closely resembling fried fish, but much more wholesome 
and digestible, 



HOW TO COOK FISH 23 

WHITING 
is very delicate cooked in a paper bag, and can be 
eaten by the youngest child or most delicate invalid with- 
out risk to the digestion. It is skinned, the tail fastened 
in the mouth, then placed in the greased bag with a table- 
spoonful of water, and cooked for about ten minutes. It 
is not so insipid as boiled whiting and is more nutritious. 

KIPPERS 

are placed in a well greased bag, and cooked in a hot 
oven for about ten minutes. They should be very savoury, 
yet by no means dried up by this means of cooking, and 
are also not so rich as when fried. 

BLOATERS 

cooked the same way are quite as tasty as when fried, 
but lighter and more digestible. 

SMOKED HADDOCKS 

acquire a new and delicious flavour when cooked in a paper 
bag. They should be carefully wiped clean, well buttered, 
peppered, and put into a greased bag for ten minutes. 
A very nice variety is obtained by cutting a neat hole in 
the bag with scissors at the end of this time, carefully 
dropping in a couple of eggs, and returning to the oven 
till the eggs are cooked. Serve on a very hot dish upon 
which a good slice of butter has been melted. Or, put 
two or three eggs in a separate bag with a cup of water, 
and let them cook for six or eight minutes ; serve in slices 
on top of the haddock. 

FISH PUDDING. 

Take equal quantities of cold mashed potatoes and cold 
cooked fish. Mix very thoroughly with two ounces of 
butter melted in two tablespoonfuls of milk to each pound 
of fish and potato, a saltspoonful of salt, half as much 
pepper, a pinch of dry mustard, and two hard-boiled eggs 



24 PAPEB-BAG COOKEEY 

cut very small. Thoroughly grease a paper bag, put in the 
mixture, place in a hot oven, and cook for ten minutes. 

RUSSIAN FISH PIE. 

Roll out a short crust paste, made by rubbing three 
ounces of vegetable lard into J lb. of self-raising flour, and 
adding a well-beaten egg. Lay on this paste a thick layer 
of cooked rice ; upon that put a layer of cooked fish, freed 
from skin and bone and pulled into flakes ; upon that lay 
slices of hard-boiled egg, and another layer of rice. Season 
highly with cayenne pepper, salt, and a little grated nut- 
meg or ground mace. Just moisten with thick white 
sauce, nicely flavoured with a few drops of lemon juice, 
and cover with pastry, pinching the edges well together. 
Slip carefully into a thoroughly greased bag, and bake in 
a hot'oven for fifteen minutes. This is extremely delicious. 

FISH SAVOURY. 

This is an original recipe, and is a very great favourite 
with most people. It requires special care and attention 
in making, but well repays the cook for any slight trouble 
it may cause her. It is also a capital way of using up 
cold fish and stale bread. Soak in cold water a little stale 
bread for an hour or two. Then drain and press very dry, 
beat up very thoroughly with a fork ; season nicely with 
pepper, paprika if possible, salt, a very little ground mace 
or the zest of a lemon. Add cold fish, freed from skin and 
bone, and a well beaten egg. Mix all very thoroughly ; 
have ready some ripe but firm tomatoes, cut off the tops, 
and scoop out the seeds and pulp. Fill the tomatoes with 
the fish mixture. Beat up some cooked rice with the pulp 
taken from the tomatoes, till it is a pretty red colour. 
Spread this coloured rice thickly on a very well greased paper 
bag, keeping the opening as wide as possible to admit the 
stuffed tomatoes, which must be embedded in the rice at 
equal distances. Bits of butter are put on the tops of each, 
the opening of the bag closed, and the bag very carefully 



HOW TO COOK FISH 25 

slid into the oven and cooked for twenty minutes. Great 
care must be exercised in dishing up to preserve the appear- 
ance and shape of the dish. It is slid "cautiously on to a 
hot dish, the bag slit and removed^ as dexterously as 
possible without disturbing the rice. If this is carefully 
done, the result will be a pretty as well as a remarkably 
savoury and appetising dish. 

TINNED FISH. 

The usual method of serving tinned salmon or lobster is 
to put it on a dish just as it is, though perhaps some more 
ambitious housewife may go the length of surrounding it 
with parsley, or even handing some salad with it. This 
is not very appetising ; but as the fish is already cooked, 
it is difficult to warm it up without extracting all the 
flavour and nourishment left in it. Also, whether fried or 
baked or warmed up in the tin, it falls to pieces and presents 
a forlorn and unsightly appearance most untempting. 

Now here is the chance of paper-bag cookery. 

TO WARM UP TINNED SALMON. 

Open the tin carefully, and drain off all the liquor. If 
it is in one firm solid piece, it will be best treated as salmon 
cutlet. Dust it lightly with pepper and salt, squeeze a little 
lemon juice over it, put it into a well buttered bag, fasten 
up very securely, and cook for six minutes in a very hot 
oven. Slide on to a very hot dish, dexterously remove the 
paper, and serve with white sauce. In appearance and 
flavour, it will be equal to fresh salmon. If the contents 
of the tin are in several pieces, however, it will be best to 
turn them into : — 

SALMON CROQUETTES. 

Open a tin of salmon, drain the liquor off, and turn 
the fish into a basin. Add an equal quantity of fine 
bread-crumbs, a little pepper and salt, a few drops of 
lemon juice, a tablespoonful of chopped cucumber, if at 
hand, and a well beaten egg, and mix thoroughly. 



26 PAPEK-BAG COOKEKY 

Form into small flat rounds, and lay in rows on the well 
buttered bag, taking great care not to break them, and 
to keep them apart, otherwise they may run together in 
cooking. Secure the opening, and keep the bag perfectly 
flat as it is cautiously slid into the oven. 

In such dishes, a large fish-slice is of great assistance 
in putting in and taking out of the bags the cooked food. 

CURRIED LOBSTER. 
Eemove the lobster from the tin and cut it into nice 
pieces ; add an ounce of butter, a finely chopped onion, 
a dessertspoonful of curry powder, and a small teacupful 
of stock already browned and thickened. Mix all well 
together, but avoid breaking up the pieces of lobster. 
Put into a thoroughly greased bag, and cook in a hot oven 
for twenty minutes. Turn into a very hot dish and add 
a squeeze of lemon before sending it to table. Serve with 
boiled rice and chillies. 

LOBSTER OUTLETS 
made from tinned lobster are very nice. Take the lobster 
from the tin, and pound it with an ounce of butter. Add 
half a saltspoonful of salt, the same of white pepper, and of 
ground mace. Beat all into a smooth paste, shape into 
neat cutlets, and cook in a well greased bag from six to eight 
minutes. 

HOT LOBSTER 
can be made from tinned lobster quite as well as from 
fresh. The lobster must be pounded exactly as in the 
previous recipe, salt, pepper, and mace being added in the 
same proportions ; mix in about half as much fine bread- 
crumbs as there is lobster, or rather less, and moisten with 
two well beaten eggs. Beat the mixture thoroughly, make 
into a shape as nearly resembling a lobster as may be, or 
into a plain roll if artistic talent is wanting, cover with 
tiny bits of butter, put into a well greased bag with great 
care, and cook from eight to ten minutes. In dishing up, 
be very careful not to let the lobster crumble or break. 



HOW TO COOK FISH 27 



LOBSTER PATTIES. 

Make some good paste with J lb. of flour, J lb. of butter, 
aud an egg. Roll out to medium thickness, and with a pastry- 
cutter cut into small rounds. Mix in a basin a tinned lobster 
cut into pieces, four tablespoonfuls of thick white sauce, a 
teaspoonful of finely mixed parsley, a few drops of anchovy 
sauce, two or three of lemon juice, and a little cayenne 
pepper. Put small heaps of this mixture on half of the 
rounds, leaving the other halves to serve as lids to the 
patties, cover each with a lid, pinching the edges well 
together, and making them into scallops. Place in a 
buttered bag, prick the top of the bag with a skewer, 
slide into a hot oven, and bake from fifteen to twenty 
minutes. The rich golden brown of the pastry will 
contrast prettily with the lobster mixture, and this 
dainty dish will be as tempting in appearance as it is 
appetising in flavour. 

MACKEREL 

has the reputation of being a tasty but very indigestible 
fish. Paper-bagged, however, it retains its savoury nature, 
but loses its undue richness. It should not be washed, but 
wiped with a damp cloth, split open, seasoned with a little 
salt, pepper, and fine oatmeal, sprinkled with a few tiny 
bits of butter on the inner side, slipped into a greased bag, 
and cooked from ten to fifteen minutes according to size. 

SARDINES 

are very appetising when cooked in a paper bag. Open 
the tin, and empty it, oil as well, into a bag. Do not 
grease the bag. While the sardines are in the oven, make 
buttered toast, which, it is perhaps needless to say, is one 
of the things which cannot be prepared in a paper bag. 
Cut the toast into strips and serve one sardine on each 
strip. They will take about five minutes in the oven. 



28 PAPEE-BAG COOKEEY 



KEDGEREE 

is a splendid breakfast dish on a cold winter's morning, 
and as it can be entirely prepared over night, saves much 
time and trouble in preparing breakfast. Grease a bag 
very thoroughly and abundantly ; place in it equal quanti- 
ties of cold cooked fish freed from bone and skin, and 
cooked rice, pepper and salt to taste, one ounce of butter, 
one teaspoonful of made mustard, and two chopped hard- 
boiled eggs. Mix very thoroughly. Next morning all that 
remains to be done is to get the oven hot, put in the bag 
and let it remain for ten minutes, when it will be ready to 
serve. 

BRILL AND TURBOT 

are both extremely delicate cooked in paper bags. Clean 
the brill, cut off the fins, and rub it over with lemon juice. 
Put it in a well greased bag with half a teacupful of 
water, and cook it from fifteen to twenty minutes according 
to size. 

Turbot, of course, must not have the fins cut off, these 
being a great delicacy, but otherwise it is cooked exactly 
like brill. 

COD SOUNDS. 

These must be soaked for an hour or two in strong salt 
and water, then very thoroughly washed and dried. They 
are then put in a paper bag with two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
and will take forty-five minutes to cook to perfection. 

SALT FISH 

should be soaked for a few hours in water and a little 
milk, then wiped dry and put into fresh water with a 
quarter of a pint of vinegar in it, in which it must remain 
overnight. Next day, take it out, wipe it dry, rub it over 
with butter, and put it into a well greased bag. It will 
take an hour to cook. 



HOW TO COOK FISH 29 

EELS. 

Small eels, such as are usually boiled, are most suitable 
for paper-bag cookery. Take four small eels, put them 
into a very well greased bag with one tablespoonful of 
water and a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Put into 
a hot oven for ten minutes, then turn the gas half-way 
down, and leave the bag for another twenty minutes. The 
eels will then be cooked to perfection, and of rich and 
delicate flavour. They should be served in a small tureen, 
and covered with parsley sauce. 

EEL PASTY 

is very delicious. A good crust is made from self-raising flour, 
butter, and an egg. Cut the pastry in two, and roll each 
piece into a pretty oval or round shape. Put the eels, cut 
into inch-long pieces, on the one half of the pastry; sprinkle 
them with minced parsley, a finely chopped onion, a little 
grated nutmeg, pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon. 
Cover over with the other piece of pastry, pinching the 
edges well together, and ornamenting them with a fork. 
Put into a very well buttered paper bag, and cook for an 
hour in a moderate oven. Have ready a very nicely 
flavoured thick white sauce, and when the pie has been 
removed from the bag and is on a hot dish, cut a hole in 
the upper crust and pour in the sauce. 

FISH CAKE 

can be made from the remains of any cold fish. Pick the 
fish free from skin and bone, chop it finely, mix it well with 
equal quantities of bread-crumbs and cold potatoes, finely 
minced parsley, salt, and pepper. Make it into a cake with 
a well beaten egg, put it into a well greased bag, and cook 
for about half an hour in a well heated oven. 



30 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

A COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS 

cannot be better cooked than in a paper bag. Cleanse the 
fish thoroughly, and rub it well over with salt, which im- 
proves the flavour very much. Then wipe it dry and fill 
with a stuffing of bread-crumbs, chopped parsley, a small 
chopped onion, some grated suet, and a beaten egg. Rub 
the fish lightly over with butter, put into a greased bag, 
and cook forty minutes. The natural juices of the fish will 
form a sauce impossible to improve upon. A fresh haddock 
may be stuffed and cooked in the same manner, and is 
extremely savoury. 

FRESH HERRINGS 

gain very much in flavour when cooked in a paper bag, 
and lose their oiliness. They are cleaned, wiped dry, split 
open, seasoned with salt, pepper, and flour. The bag is 
lightly greased to prevent the fish from sticking, but no 
butter or dripping must be put on the herring. Fifteen 
minutes will cook them to a turn. 

PLAICE, SOLES, AND FLOUNDERS 

are simply brushed over with oiled butter, put into a well 
greased bag, and cooked for ten to twenty minutes according 
to size. 

SEA BREAM. 

Paper-bag cookery is ideal for bream. Well wash the 
fish, but do not have it scaled. Open it and fill with the 
stuffing recommended for cod's head and shoulders. Fasten 
it together again, wipe dry, and put into a greased bag. 
Cook for thirty minutes — longer if very large. Turn out 
on a hot dish, remove paper, scales, and skin ; then place 
the bream on another hot dish on which a large piece 
of butter has been melted. Serve at once. 



HOW TO COOK FISH 31 



FISH STEW 

is an uncommon but very excellent dish. Small soles, 
flounders, dabs, and eels are capital cooked thus. Some- 
times very small fish of this sort can be bought cheaply, 
but seem hardly worth cooking, and would be certainly 
cooked into mere dry scraps in ordinary cookery. 
Prepared in a paper bag, however, a very dainty 
meal may be made from them. Cleanse the fish and 
wipe them dry. Have ready a large bag, which has been 
sharply inspected and pronounced intact ; well grease 
it both inside and out, put in the fish, cut in halves, 
or if very tiny, whole, if eels, cut into inch-long pieces. 
A mixture of the above-mentioned fish is better than if the 
stew consist of one kind only. Add half an onion cut into 
very thin slices, some finely chopped parsley, two cloves, 
one blade of mace, two bay leaves, a sprig of thyme, salt 
and pepper to taste. When this is all safely in the bag, 
pour in a cupful of stock, fish or meat stock, or if none is at 
hand, water will do, but whatever it is it must be slightly 
thickened. A small glass of port wine or claret is a great 
improvement. Close the bag very securely, and put into 
the oven for thirty-five minutes. 



CHAPTER III. 

HOW TO COOK MEAT. 

Paper-bag cookery should appeal especially to the caterer 
for a small family. The difficulty of providing suitable 
joints for households of three or four persons is very great. 
A small piece of sirloin or half leg of mutton dries up to 
nothing when cooked in the ordinary way, and loud are 
the complaints that the flavour and juiciness of a large 




PUTTING THE JOINT INTO THE BAG. 

This sketch shows how joints must be placed in the paper bag. 
The bag should rest on the table ; lift the uppermost edge, and 
your food or joint can be slipped in. 

joint is not to be had under ten to twelve pounds of meat. 
Yet, if the housewife invests in the large, juicy joint 
desired, she finds it a very expensive business. One day's 
dinner hot and one cold is all that is really relished. Then 

32 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 33 

follow the monotonous hash, the grill, the fried-up pieces, 
till everybody is tired of the eternal warmed-up dinners. 
If it is summer, probably a third of the expensive joint 
goes bad before it can be eaten up. 




TAKING THE BAG OUT OF THE OVEN. 

The nose of the dish should be held about two inches under the 
grid. This allows the bag to be pulled out on to the dish. 

Cooked in a paper bag, however, the small joint is full 
as juicy and savoury as the eighteen-pound sirloin can be, 
while a dainty piece of loin of lamb is a delicacy which 
must be tasted to be realised. 

LOIN OF LAMB. 

Two pounds and a half or three pounds of loin of lamb 
will make a sufficient dinner for a small family of three 
or four persons, and leave enough cold to serve for supper. 
Wipe the meat over with a cloth dipped in hot water, 
and then with a clean dry cloth. Loin of lamb or mutton, 
being a fat joint, it is better not to grease the bag. Pre- 
pare a nice veal stuffing and lay it along the inside of the 
loin, drawing the flap over and skewering it to keep it 
in position. Put the meat in a good-sized bag ; have the 
oven well heated ; place the bag on the grid. Ten minutes 
c 



34 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

later turn the gas about half-way down, and let it cook 
forty minutes longer, when it will be done to a turn, and 
be a rich golden brown. 

SIRLOIN. 

A piece of sirloin weighing between three and four 
pounds would not be worth eating if cooked in the ordinary 
way, but cooked in a paper bag it is a morsel for the gods. 
The bag must be greased and the joint lightly rubbed 
over with a little dripping. Forty-five minutes, ten with 
the gas fully turned on, should be sufficient for a joint 
weighing four pounds and under, unless liked very well 
done, when an extra ten minutes will not be found too 
much. If liked really underdone, it will be just right in 
forty minutes. 

SHOULDER OF LAMB. 

A small shoulder weighing three pounds or very little 
over is remarkably delicate, just the right size for a small 
household, and, cooked in a paper bag, is delicious. The 
butcher should be directed to bone it, and the cavity 
should be filled with a good forcemeat. Grease the joint 
over, but not the bag, and roast for fifty minutes, the gas 
being full on for the first fifteen. 

ROAST VEAL 
is peculiarly adapted for paper-bag cooking, and a 
small fillet of veal makes a capital dish. The centre bone 
is taken out and the hole left slightly enlarged. The 
stuffing to fill this must be rather rich — a breakfastcupful 
of fine bread-crumbs, one ounce of grated suet, two 
rashers of fat, streaky bacon, finely minced, two or 
three oysters chopped coarsely, a tablespoonful of minced 
parsley, salt and pepper to taste, the zest of a lemon, and 
a well beaten egg. This must be firmly pushed into the 
cavity, and the joint then rubbed over with plenty of 
bacon dripping. Grease the bag thickly both inside and 
out. If the fillet weighs three pounds it will take an hour 
to cook, the gas fully on for ten minutes, then reduced 
one-half to finish. 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 35 

ROAST PORK. 

For a small family, a part of the loin should be purchased, 
a little stuffing of sage and finely minced onion introduced, 
and the joint cooked in a slightly greased bag, allowing 
twenty-five minutes to each pound. A roast leg of pork 
is also particularly well flavoured cooked in a paper bag. 
Stuffing may be introduced under the knuckle skin, or 
a savoury pudding (see chapter v.) may be cooked along 
with it. Both joints should be rubbed over with pure 
salad oil before being put into the bag. 

ROAST CHICKEN 
is a dainty morsel cooked in a paper bag. Nicely stuffed, 
it is rubbed over with butter and put into a well greased 
bag. Forty minutes is sufficient for a chicken. A large 
fowl will be tender and beautifully cooked in an hour. 

GRAVY AND DRIPPING. 

This is a very serious question. Many people are so 
devoted to gravy that, to quote Mrs. Todgers, in Martin 
Chuzzkwit, "a whole animal wouldn't supply them," 
and they will undoubtedly be disappointed in the amount 
of gravy got from a paper-bagged joint. In this method of 
cooking, the gravy stays in the meat, and that is what 
renders it so delicious, so juicy, so full of flavour. The 
meat which is dry and flavourless in proportion as its 
rich juices have been extracted, is the meat which yields 
most gravy. Therefore, paper-bagged joints yield very 
little gravy, and to add any water to the few spoonfuls 
of rich, strong gravy they do yield would be to spoil 
the flavour utterly. When the bag is opened, the small 
quantity of gravy and dripping within must be poured 
into a basin, the fat skimmed off, and the remaining 
gravy added to some gravy made from stock, and kept hot 
in readiness, poured into the gravy-boat and sent to table. 

There will be very little dripping, for the same reason 



36 PAPEE-BAG COOKEEY 

as there is very little gravy, but the mellowness of fat 
cooked in a paper bag is quite indescribable, therefore the 
scanty supply can be no very great drawback. 

TINNED FOODS. 

Tinned foods fill a very important part in housekeeping. 
It is a great convenience to have some tins of various 
preserved foods in the store-room for use in emergencies. 
The butcher may fail to call, a downpour of rain prevent 
a shopping expedition, or guests may unexpectedly arrive 
on a " finish-up " day, that institution so dear to the heart 
of the thrifty housewife, who A so contrives the fragments 
of the larder that they form a sufficient meal for the 
household without leaving a crumb over. In all such 
emergencies it is very comforting to know that the larder 
is well furnished with tinned foods of reliable brands. 

Then, again, tinned foods are the great stand-by of 
people living in apartments. There is little accommodation 
for storing food, and it is not pleasant to keep meat, even 
f orja few hours only, in the room where one sits ; in summer 
it becomes an impossibility. The landlady may be obliging 
enough to offer the use of her safe, but there are obvious 
drawbacks to this arrangement. Therefore, tinned foods 
are frequently brought into use, and prove very handy 
to the lonely woman in lodgings, or the small family living 
in apartments. Still tinned foods are not very appetising. 
Served cold, they neither look tempting nor taste savoury, 
especially on a winter's day ; heated in the tin they acquire 
an unpleasant " tinny " flavour, re-cooked as stews, or 
put into a hot oven, they lose all flavour and nutritive 
value. So utterly do they lose their distinctive taste that 
it is impossible to tell beef from mutton, rabbit from chicken. 
It is in such cases that paper-bag cookery proves itself 
invaluable. A dish specially to be recommended is 

MINCED STEAKS. 

It is put up in tins costing elevenpence halfpenny each, 
and one tin will make an ample dinner for four or five 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 37 

persons, or provide several meals for one. The method 
of cooking is simplicity itself. 

Well grease a good-sized bag, both inside and out, turn 
the mince out of the tin into the bag, with no additions of 
any kind. Put into a hot oven for fifteen minutes. Serve 
with a border of cooked rice (see chapter iv.), and any 
vegetable preferred. This is a delicious dish, the flavour 
and juice so well preserved by the method of cooking that 
it cannot be distinguished from mince made from rump 
steak. 

ROAST BEEF 
is rather insipid served cold from the tin, and is flavourless 
re-cooked in the tin. Turned out, however, thickly spread 
with roast-beef dripping, put into a thoroughly greased 
bag, laid in a very hot oven for fifteen minutes, and served 
on a hot dish with small paper-bagged tomatoes (see 
chapter iv.), it is exceedingly nice. 

ROAST MUTTON 

is prepared in the same manner, but small onions cooked 
in paper bags may be substituted for the tomatoes. 

TINNED RABBIT 
is best served as curry. Well grease a paper bag. Turn 
the rabbit out of the tin (it will probably be rather broken 
and the flesh be separated from the bones), and put into 
the bag in neat pieces. Add two finely minced onions, a 
cooking apple cut in dice, the juice of half a lemon, and 
a teacupful of stock, browned and thickened and with a 
dessertspoonful of curry powder stirred smoothly into it. 
Fifteen minutes in a hot oven will be sufficient for this. 

TINNED CHICKEN 
is very nice curried like the rabbit. Or it may be fricasseed. 
Turn it out of the tin, add a teacupful of white stock, 
thickened with arrowroot and seasoned with salt, pepper, 
and a little ground mace or nutmeg, a finely minced onion, 



38 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

a few young carrots, and turnips cut into dice, and a few 
green peas. Put into a well-greased bag and lay in a hot 
oven for fifteen minutes. 

BAKED MUTTON IN CRUST. 

This is a particularly delightful way of cooking mutton, 
for it retains all the juice and flavour of the meat, and is 
exceedingly light and digestible. 

Choose a nice solid piece of mutton, the fillet end of the 
leg is the best. Make a good suet crust, using beef 
suet and water ; roll it out to about a quarter of an 
inch in thickness ; it must not be too thin. Keep it a square 
shape, and make it large enough to contain the meat and 
completely cover it. Place the meat in the centre of the 
crust, which neatly fold over it, pinching the opening 
well together after damping, and sprinkle flour over it. 
Then thickly grease a paper bag large enough to hold it 
easily, and gently slide it in. If the meat weighs about 
four pounds it will take about an hour and a half to cook, 
the oven being very hot at first, and the heat reduced by 
half after ten minutes. This dish is extremely nice, the 
meat particularly juicy and tender, and the crust superior 
in flavour to that cooked in any other way. 

THE HOMELY IRISH STEW 
is admirable cooked in a paper bag. Buy two pounds of 
small neck of mutton chops, trim nicely and take away 
excess of bone and fat. Cut two or three small onions 
into rather thin slices, and two pounds of potatoes into 
thick slices, sprinkle meat, onions, and potatoes with herbs 
finely rubbed to powder, salt and pepper to taste, add a 
large breakfastcupful of water. Fasten the bag very se- 
curely, and cook in a hot oven for one hour. Turn into a 
very hot dish. 

HARICOT STEAK. 
Take a pound and a half of good steak, with no gristle 
or sinew in it. Cut into neat pieces about two inches square. 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 39 

Chop an onion finely, cut several tomatoes in slices and 
add these, also some green peas, and young carrots and 
turnips cut in dice. Rub a teaspoonful of " Bisto " smooth 
with a little water, and add it to a breakfastcupful of 
water. If any sour milk is at hand, a tablespoonful of 
this will be a great improvement. Tie together a bay leaf, 
a few sprigs of parsley and thyme, and put this in also. 
Put all the materials into a good-sized paper bag, which has 
been well greased, fasten very carefully, and cook in a hot 
oven for forty-five minutes. 

STEAKS. 
It has been said that a steak grilled over an open fire 
is the perfection of steak, but that is merely because steak 
cooked in a paper bag has not yet become known. Well 
grease a paper bag, put in a pound of rump steak cut in a 
thick slice, and put on the grid in a hot oven for about 
fifteen minutes. 

CHOPS 

are daintier and more savoury done in a paper bag than in 
any other way. Choose loin chops, trim them very nicely, 
and lay side by side in a well greased bag. Put in a hot 
oven and cook for about fifteen minutes. 

BEEF OLIVES. 

A pound of beefsteak cut into neat slices, longer than 
broad, makes a nice dish of beef olives. Mix a nice stuffing 
of two ounces of grated suet, two of bread-crumbs, a 
tablespoonful of minced parsley, a little ground mace, 
pepper and salt to taste, and a well beaten egg. Spread 
each olive with this, roll up, tie with string, lay tidily in 
a greased bag, put in a hot oven and cook for forty-five 
minutes. Serve on a very hot dish, with a pat of Maitre 
d'hotel butter placed on each olive. 

BEEFSTEAK PUDDING. 

Make a nice suet crust with finely chopped or shredded 
suet, self-raising flour, and water. Roll it out to a medium 
thickness, and cut it in two. Shape both pieces into a 



40 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

neat round. On the one round lay a pound of steak cut 
into small pieces rather larger than dice ; add two sheep 
kidneys cut small, season with salt, pepper, a finely minced 
onion, a tablespoonful of flour ; add a teaspoonful of vinegar 
or lemon juice, and a tablespoonful of water. Cover with 
the other piece of crust, pinching the edges well together. 
Put into a greased bag, and cook in a hot oven for about 
forty-five minutes. 

IMITATION HARE. 

Mince one pound of beefsteak with half a pound of raw 
fat bacon, add half the quantity of bread-crumbs, salt 
and pepper to taste, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce and a 
well beaten egg. Form into a neat shape, slide into a 
greased bag, and cook forty minutes. 

A CARPET BAG. 

This is an uncommon and very delicious dish. Choose 
a large thick steak in one piece and of equal thickness all 
over. Cover it thickly with small plump oysters, roll it 
up, secure each end, put it into a greased bag, and cook 
it in a very hot oven for forty-five minutes. 

INDIAN CURRY. 

Cut the meat, mutton, steak, or poultry into small 
pieces ; peel and chop an onion very finely, mix with the 
juice of half a lemon, pepper and salt to taste ; add a cup 
of sour milk, in which a dessertspoonful of curry powder 
and one of flour have been mixed smooth ; put it into a 
large bag, and cook for forty-five minutes. 

PAPER-BAGGED RABBIT. 

Cut the rabbit into neat joints, add a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two finely chopped onions, three cloves, three whole 
allspice, half a teaspoonful of black pepper, a thinly cut 
piece of lemon rind, two tablespoonfuls of mushroom 
ketchup, and two rashers of fat bacon cut in dice. Add a 
teacupful of stock, thickened and browned, and put into 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 41 

a well greased bag. Cook in a hot oven for forty minutes, 
if the rabbit is young and tender. If not, an hour will not 
be too much. 

KIDNEYS 
are delicious cooked in a paper bag. Take four sheep's 
kidneys, cut in two, take out the core. Wrap each kidney 
in a thin slice of fat bacon. Put into a well greased bag, 
and cook in a hot oven for twelve minutes. 

KIDNEY STEW. 

Skin and trim the kidneys, remove the core, cut into 
quarters. Roll each piece in flour, highly seasoned with 
salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, and a little dry mustard. 
Place in a greased bag with a tablespoonful of minced onion, 
half as much minced parsley, and a teacupful of stock, 
browned and thickened. Thirty minutes in a hot oven will 
cook this. 

LIVER AND BACON. 

Cut a pound of sheep's liver into small pieces, dip each 
in seasoned flour, wrap round with a very thin piece of fat 
bacon ; put into a greased bag with two tablespoonfuls 
of water and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Cook from 
fifteen to twenty minutes. 

MINCE COLLOPS. 
Mince one pound of beefsteak very finely, dust with 
a little flour and season with salt and pepper. If liked, 
a finely minced onion may be added. Put this in a greased 
paper bag with half a teacupful of water, and cook for 
twenty-five minutes. 

SAUSAGES. 
Put a pound of pork sausages into cold water for five 
minutes. Then take them out and strip off the skins. Put 
them in a lightly greased bag, and cook them for twelve 
minutes. As a pleasant variety, two or three tomatoes, 
skinned and cut in halves, may be cooked in the same bag, 
and are excellent. Other savoury breakfast dishes are : — 



42 PAPEK-BAG COOKEKY 

ANGELS ON HORSEBACK. 

Take some very thin slices of bacon, lay an oyster on 
each, secure, and put in a well buttered bag. Six minutes 
will cook these nicely. 

HAM AND EGGS. 

The national breakfast dish is greatly improved by being 
cooked in a paper bag. The required number of rashers 
are put into a bag in a hot oven, and after six minutes a hole 
is cut in the paper and the eggs dropped carefully in. As 
soon as they are set, which will be in a few minutes, the 
dish is ready for serving. 

EGGS. 

Eggs put into a bag with a cup of water, and placed in a 
hot oven for four to five minutes, are superior to those 
cooked in a saucepan. 

DRESDEN PATTIES. 
Take some slices of stale bread and cut out rounds of 
about two inches in diameter. Scoop out the centre to 
form a deep cavity. Dip these in a thick batter. Have 
ready a mixture of minced cooked chicken and ham, 
stirred to a thick paste with white sauce. Fill the rounds 
with this, put into a buttered bag, and cook ten minutes. 

SAVOURY EGGS. 

Put into a paper bag as many eggs as may be required, 
add a cupful of water, and put into a hot oven for fifteen 
minutes. Take out and drop into cold water. When cold 
shell and cut them in halves lengthways ; take out the 
yolks, and pound them with minced ham, minced parsley, 
salt, pepper, and butter. Eeturn the mixture to the whites, 
press firmly together, brush over with oiled butter, put into 
a greased bag, and return to the oven for five minutes. 

SCOTCH EGGS. 

Proceed with the eggs as in the previous recipe, but cut 
the cooked eggs in halves across, not lengthways. Have 



HOW TO COOK MEAT 43 

ready sausage-meat mixed with a raw beaten egg. Lightly 
flour the halves of the eggs, and wrap each half in sausage- 
meat, rolling into the shape of a ball. Put into a buttered 
bag, and cook twelve minutes. 

POTATO SURPRISE. 

Take six raw potatoes, wash and peel them, and scoop out 
a good deal of the inside ; fill with nicely minced meat 
(cooked or raw), chopped parsley, salt, pepper, a little 
butter, and a tablespoonful of tomato sauce. Put into a 
greased bag, and cook from thirty to forty-five minutes, 
according to size. 

SCOTCH WOODCOCK. 

Take a dessertspoonful of Yarmouth bloater-paste, a 
tablespoonful of cream, a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, the beaten yolks of two eggs, and a little cayenne 
pepper. Mix all very thoroughly, put into a buttered bag, 
and cook five minutes. Have ready hot buttered toast cut 
in strips. Spread each strip with the paste and serve 
very hot. 

EPIGRAMS. 

This is a very savoury breakfast dish and easily made. 
Cut neat slices from a cold leg of mutton. Spread them with 
Strasbourg meat or any nicely flavoured potted meat that 
may be at hand. Make a very thick batter with four ounces 
of flour, one tablespoonful of oil (or oiled butter), pepper, 
salt, a gill of milk, and an egg. Press two slices together, 
thus making a sandwich, dip into the batter, and place 
in a well buttered bag. Do this with all the pieces, arrang- 
ing them side by side in the bag, but a little apart, that 
they may not run together in the cooking. Slide cautiously 
on to the hot grid, without disturbing them, and cook 
fifteen minutes. Serve on a very hot dish and immediately, 
for they lose their lightness very quickly. 



CHAPTEE IV. 

HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES. 



Those who have tried the foregoing recipes are unanimous 
in their approval, but as regards the cooking of vegetables 
in paper bags, opinions are divided. Several noted vege- 
tarians are enthusiastic on the subject, and declare that 
paper-cooking is the very best possible way of conserving 
the juices and flavour of all vegetables. Others, again, shake 
doubtful heads, though they admit that some vegetables 
are improved by this method of cooking, while others are 
quite decided against it, maintaining that a new and un- 
pleasant flavour is imparted to vegetables so cooked. On 
investigation, however, it will be found that these last- 




PREPARING TO COOK CABBAGE. 

mentioned critics have not given paper-bag cookery 
a fair trial. They have probably seized on the homely 
cabbage as an inexpensive subject on which to experiment, 
hastily washed it, thrust it into a paper bag, and placed it 
in the oven for an indefinite period. The result, naturally, 

44 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 45 

is uneatable. Shredded very finely, and put into a well 
buttered bag with a cup of water, a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, pepper, and salt, a palatable dish will 
emerge from the oven. At the same time, cabbage, plainly 
boiled or cooked in a conservative boilerette, is in many 
people's estimation a more superior dish. Potatoes, again, 
are a cause of division in the camp. They undoubtedly 
acquire a new flavour when cooked in a paper bag, and 
this flavour is not agreeable to every palate. Many people 
prefer new potatoes plainly boiled, for the young, im- 
mature vegetable is of so watery a nature that unless the 
moisture be dispersed by rapid boiling, the potato is too 
wet and waxy to be palatable. For this reason, new 
potatoes cooked by steam or in a conservative boilerette 
are seldom liked, and paper-bagged new potatoes are open 
to the same objection. It is a different matter, however, 
with old potatoes, which, when cooked in a paper bag, are 
very generally liked, and several excellent and proved 
recipes for cooking old potatoes in paper bags are given 
further on. 

Asparagus is not always a success cooked in a paper bag. 
Some people complain that the flavour is by no means so 
delicate when so treated as when simply boiled or cooked 
by steam or in a conservative boilerette, therefore this 
vegetable is best put on the black list. 

Other vegetables which have been tried and found 
wanting are celery, turnip-tops, and artichokes. These, 
however, when once boiled, can be utilised to make many 
delightful dishes in paper-bag cookery. It may, too, be 
worth the while of the ardent paper-bag cook to continue 
to experiment with them until success crowns her efforts. 
Speaking personally, these vegetables have not met with 
general approval when cooked in paper bags. But one 
cannot waste time in lamentations over the few vegetables 
which are failures cooked in this way, when one considers 
how many there are which gain so much in flavour as to be 
a revelation in delicacy and richness of taste to those who 
have only known them cooked in the ordinary way. 



46 PAPEK-BAG COOKEEY 

Green peas gain a perfectly exquisite flavour when 
cooked in a paper bag, but a certain amount of care is 
required. Too much water will ruin them, and if left too 
long in the oven they will be hard. One family declared 
with one voice against paper-bag cookery, because a dish 
of young, fresh peas emerged from the oven looking like 
tiny brown bullets, and crackling crisply between the teeth 
of those who tried to eat them. But this, of course, was 
the fault of a careless, incompetent cook, not of paper-bag 
cookery. ' 

Broad beans are delicious cooked paper-bag fashion ; 
but here, also, care and attention are required, as also with 
French beans and scarlet runners. Tomatoes cooked in this 
way are infinitely superior to those cooked in any other 
way, and there are a great variety of delicious tomato 
dishes to be cooked in paper bags. Young carrots and 
turnips gain in flavour so cooked, and cauliflower paper- 
bagged is unsurpassed. Brussels sprouts are not without 
merit, and mushrooms, onions, cucumber, and vegetable 
marrow gain so much in flavour as to almost fulfil the 
harassed housewife's aspiration for a new discovery in 
vegetables. 

POTATOES. 

Pare and wash the required number of potatoes and 
place in the greased bag wet from the washing. Put in a 
hot oven and cook for fifty minutes, reducing the heat after 
ten minutes. 

STEWED POTATOES 

are a very savoury dish. Wash and peel as many potatoes 
as are wanted, cut each into four thick slices, and put in a 
greased paper bag, with a finely chopped peeled onion, a 
tablespoonful of minced parsley, a good piece of roast-beef 
dripping, salt and pepper to taste, and half a cup of water. 
In forty minutes turn this savoury and delicious potato 
mixture into a very hot dish and serve at once. 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 47 

DUCHESS POTATOES. 

This is an excellent way of using up cold mashed potatoes. 
Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a little milk, the quan- 
tities being in proportion to the amount of potato ; add 
pepper, salt, a pinch of dry mustard, and beat all very 
thoroughly up together. Butter a bag very thickly, put 
in the potato, and cook in a hot oven for ten minutes. 

SLICED POTATOES. 

Slice the potatoes thickly, wash well, and then dry in a 
cloth. Sprinkle with salt and a little flour. Butter a 
" Papakuk " bag very thickly, and cook for thirty minutes. 
The bag must be shaken now and then to make the potatoes 
crisp. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Shell the peas and to each half peck add a pinch of salt, 
one lump of sugar, and one leaf of mint ; more than one 
leaf would give too strong a flavour to the peas. Add one 
glass of water, and cook for three-quarters of an hour. The 
gas should be reduced after five minutes. If the heat is 
too great, the peas will be hard. 

BROAD BEANS. 

Remove the pods and then shell the beans. This extra 
trouble is quite worth taking, for it makes all the difference 
in the delicacy of the flavour, and the skins are very easily 
removed. Put the beans when skinned into a thickly 
buttered bag, add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, 
into which has been worked a tablespoonful of flour, a 
little salt, and a teaspoonful of minced onion. Add also a 
cupful of water, and cook three-quarters of an hour, re- 
ducing the heat after the first five minutes. 

DUCHESS GREEN PEAS. 
Shell the peas and put into a thickly buttered bag with 
a lettuce cleaned and pulled into very small pieces, a few 



48 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

spring onions, a leaf of mint, a pinch of salt, a little castor 
sugar, a good slice of butter, and a cupful of water. Cook 
for about three-quarters of an hour, the gas turned down 
after the first five minutes. 

FRENCH BEANS AND SCARLET RUNNERS. 

These are excellent cooked in a paper bag. Contrary 
to the opinion of many cooks, the beans should never be 
sliced, but cooked whole. If the scarlet runners are very 
large and coarse, they may be cut into two or three pieces, 
but otherwise, they should merely have the tops and 
stringy parts removed and be cooked entire. Put them 
into a well buttered bag, with a slice of butter, a table- 
spoonful of minced parsley, the same of minced onion, if 
the flavour is liked, the juice of half a lemon and half a 
teacupful of water. Cook for about thirty minutes. 

CARROTS. 

Wash and scrape a bunch of young carrots, and put 

them into a buttered bag, with half a teacupful of milk and 

water. Cook for twenty minutes. If the carrots are large 

and no longer young, they should be cut into thick slices. 

TURNIPS. 

New turnips are delicious when cooked in a well 
buttered paper bag. Wash and peel them, cut into thick 
slices, put into a greased bag, with half a cupful of 
milk and water, a pinch of salt, a pinch of castor sugar, 
and half a teaspoonful of white pepper. Cook for about 
thirty minutes. 

MUSHROOMS. 

These are particularly good cooked in a paper bag. They 
must be freshly gathered, if they are to be really nice. 
Cut off a portion of the stalk, peel the top, and wipe the 
mushrooms carefully with a piece of flannel and a little 
salt. Put them into a buttered bag, with a piece of butter 
on each mushroom. Cook for twenty minutes. This 
method preserves all the aroma and flavour of the mush- 
room. 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 49 

CAULIFLOWER. 

There is no more delicious way of cooking a cauliflower 
than by cooking it in a paper bag. Cut away all the green, 
carefully cleanse|the cauliflower,fcutting thejstalk cross- 
wise to secure equal cooking. Lightly butter the cauli- 
flower all over, put very carefully into a bag witlf half a 
tumbler of water, and cook thirty minutes. 

PARSNIPS. 

Wash, pare, and cut into slices as many parsnips as may 
be required, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put them into 
a greased paper bag, with a cup of water and a little 
thickened milk. Cook for twenty minutes. 

ONIONS. 

The onion is rich in nitrogenous matter, induces sleep 
when taken at night, and is excellent as a remedy for colds. 
It has a soothing action on the nerves, and is beneficial to 
the kidneys. Take moderate-sized Spanish onions, remove 
the outer skin ; cut off the tops to form lids, and hollow 
out a little of the onion. Fill this with sausage-meat, 
cored and skinned sheep's kidney, or a little minced and 
seasoned meat. Rub over with dripping, put into a well 
greased bag, and cook for an hour. 

ONIONS AND TOMATOES. 

These two vegetables go particularly well together. 
One excellent method of cooking them is to take as many 
tomatoes as there are onions, slice off the tops, scoop out 
some of the pulp, and carefully fix them in the hollow 
of onions, which have been steamed till tender and a 
hollow scooped in each. Put a piece of butter in the 
tomato centres, drop an egg into each, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, add a tiny bit more butter, replace the top of 
the tomato, cover with the piece of onion previously cut 
off, put into a well greased bag, and cook for fifteen 
minutes. 



50 PAPEB-BAG COOKEKY 

TOMATO STEW. 

Take nice ripe tomatoes. Plunge into boiling water for 
a few seconds, then put into cold water for the same length 
of time. Take them out and pull off the skins, which will 
now come away readily. Cut them up roughly in a basin ; 
add salt and pepper, the grated rind of half a lemon, a 
bouquet of herbs, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf, and half 
a teacupful of water, and a piece of butter. Mix together, 
and turn into a well buttered bag. Cook for twenty 
minutes. Empty into a hot dish, pick out the bouquet of 
herbs, and serve immediately. 

TOMATO PIE. 

Prepare the tomatoes as in the foregoing recipe, and put 
into a basin roughly cut up. Mix in a tablespoonful of 
chopped onion, salt, and pepper, a teaspoonful of grated 
lemon rind, half a cupful of weak stock or water, a table- 
spoonful of fine bread-crumbs, a small piece of butter. 
Have ready macaroni boiled and cut in inch-long pieces. 
Mix with the tomato. Thickly butter a " Papakuk " bag, 
put in the pie, and cook for twenty minutes. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

This is a very nice supper or breakfast dish. Choose ripe 
but firm tomatoes. Cut off the tops, and put them aside. 
Scoop out the seeds from the tomatoes, and fill with a little 
minced cooked meat, nicely seasoned ; or cut a sheep's 
kidney in four and use it as stuffing ; or a pork sausage 
skinned and made to fit the hollow. Put a tiny piece of 
butter on each, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a little 
minced parsley ; fit on the lids, brush over with oiled 
butter, put into a greased " Papakuk " bag, and cook for 
twenty minutes. 

VEGETABLE MARROWS. 

These are particularly good cooked in " Papakuk " 
fashion. Plainly boiled and served with white sauce, it 
is an insipid vegetable, and even mashed with butter it is not 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 51 

very savoury. Prepared, however, in the following method, 
it is both tasty and satisfying. It is best pared before being 
cooked, although many vegetarians maintain that by doing 
so a great deal of the flavour and juice is lost, an assertion 
made also of the cucumber. This is very true when either 
vegetable is cooked in the ordinary way, but not so in 
paper-bag cookery. Having peeled the marrow, it must be 
cut in two, lengthways, and all the seeds and fibres re- 
moved. The cavity must be filled with a tasty stuffing of 
minced onion, cooked meat, finely minced, and half as 
much bread-crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, and 
also some minced parsley, chopped beef suet, and a well- 
beaten egg. Tie the two halves together with thin string, 
brush over with oiled butter, put carefully into a thickly 
greased bag, and cook forty-five minutes. 

SLICED VEGETABLE MARROW. 

Peel a rather small marrow, and slice it into rings, 
cutting out all seeds and fibres. Sprinkle each ring with 
salt and pepper. Have ready a very thick batter, dip 
each ring in this, and put it, with as much batter as it will 
take up, into a very thickly buttered bag, and cook thirty 
minutes. 

SAVOURY VEGETABLE MARROW. 

This is a very tasty vegetable dish. Peel, cut open 
right through the middle, not lengthways ; take four or 
five ripe tomatoes, plunge first into boiling, then into cold 
water, to remove the skins, then cut up roughly in a basin, 
add two onions, finely minced, a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, salt and pepper to taste, a slice of butter or some 
grated suet, any remnants of cold ham or bacon there may 
be in the house, finely minced, a teaspoonful of minced 
parsley, half a cupful of fine bread-crumbs. Bind the 
mixture with the yolk of an egg, well beaten, and fill in the 
two halves of the marrow. Carefully put each half in a 
separate well buttered bag, the mixture side uppermost, 
and cook for forty-five minutes. 



52 PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

CUCUMBER. 

Simply peel one or more cucumbers, brush over with 
oiled butter, season with salt, pepper, sprinkle over with 
a little flour, put into a well buttered " Papakuk " bag, 
and cook twenty minutes. 

CUCUMBER FRITTERS. 

Peel a young cucumber, cut in slices of a medium thick- 
ness, season with salt, pepper, the juice of a lemon, and 
leave them to soak for an hour. Have ready a thick batter, 
dip in the slices, sprinkle with minced parsley and a little 
minced onion, put into a thickly greased bag and cook 
fifteen minutes. 

CUCUMBER STUFFED. 

Peel a large thick cucumber, cut off the top, scoop out 
the seeds, fill with a mixture of minced cold meat, a few 
bread-crumbs, seasoning, and a little stock to moisten. 
A very nice stuffing is made with some sausage-meat or 
some kidneys cut small, flavoured with minced onion and 
parsley. Fix on the top with white of egg, brush over with 
oiled butter, sprinkle with bread-crumbs, and cook twenty 
minutes in a thickly greased bag. 

Cereals do not seem very adaptable for paper-bag 
cookery, but with a little care and attention they lend 
themselves very fairly to this method of cooking, and 
gain considerably in flavour thereby. 

BUTTER BEANS 

are extremely nice cooked in paper-bag fashion. They 
want a great deal of soaking to be really mellow. Wash 
the beans well, and put to soak early in the morning in 
abundance of water. Leave all day. By night the beans 
will have absorbed most of the water. Pour off any that 
may remain, leaving them quite dry. Cover the basin and 
leave till morning. This gives the beans a much nicer 
flavour than if they were cooked at once. Next day skin 
them. They are much superior when the outer skin is 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 53 

removed, and the trouble is really trifling. Put them into 
a buttered bag with a cupful of water, a sprinkle of minced 
parsley, a tablespoonful of minced onion, two rashers of 
fat bacon, cut into dice, but no salt, which would render 
them hard. They will be ready in an hour and a half. If 
the skins are left on, they will take another half-hour. Have 
ready a little butter, just melted over the fire, season with 
salt and pepper, and pour over the dish of beans before 
sending to table. If the bacon is omitted, substitute a 
good slice of butter in the bag. 

LENTILS. 

Either Egyptian or German lentils are excellent in a 
paper bag. Wash them well, soak all night in abundance 
of fresh, cold water. Next day put them in a well greased 
" Papakuk " bag, with the water in which they have been 
soaking, a carrot, a turnip, a parsnip, and an onion, chopped 
up roughly. Add neither salt nor pepper. Cook two 
hours, and they will then be tender enough to press through 
a colander. Season the resulting puree with salt and 
pepper, re-heat, and serve as a vegetable. Or add enough 
boiling stock to make a thick cream, stir in carefully a 
well beaten egg, and serve as soup. 

LENTIL CUTLETS. 

Cook the lentils as in the recipe already given. When 
they have been pressed through a colander, add enough 
bread-crumbs and mashed potato to make a stiff paste, 
season rather highly with salt, pepper, a little lemon juice, 
and a tablespoonful of onion juice. Mix thoroughly, form 
into neat cutlets, place in a thickly buttered bag, and cook 
fifteen minutes. 

RICE. 

Well wash a cup of rice, and put to soak overnight. 
Next day put it with the water in which it has soaked and 
at least another cupful into a very thoroughly greased bag. 
If it is not sufficiently greased, the rice will stick to it. 
Cook thirty-five minutes. 



54 PAPEK-BAG COOKERY 

SAVOURY RICE. 

Soak a cup of well washed rice overnight. Next day- 
put it into a well greased bag with a sliced onion, two 
skinned and cut-up tomatoes, pepper, salt, a piece of 
thinly cut lemon rind, a couple of rashers of streaky bacon 
cut in dice. Add a cupful of stock^or water and cook 
thirty-five minutes. 

VEGETABLE ROLL. 

Mash a quarter of a pound each of cooked carrot, turnip, 
vegetable marrow, haricot beans, and potatoes. Season 
with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, mixed herbs ; mix all 
well, bind with a beaten egg, form into a shapely roll, put 
into a greased bag, and cook fifteen minutes. 

SAVOURY MACARONI. 

Cut cold boiled macaroni into convenient lengths, and 
put into a basin. Skin and cut up roughly two or three 
ripe tomatoes ; tinned may be used when fresh ones are 
expensive. Add these to the macaroni ; add also a table- 
spoonful of strong gravy or some made from "Lemco " or 
any good meat extract ; pepper, salt, a chopped onion, half 
a cup of fine bread-crumbs, and the zest of a lemon. Put 
all into a well buttered bag and cook fifteen minutes. 

GROUND RICE FRITTERS. 

Rub ground rice smooth in a little milk, and add enough 
to boiling milk to make a thick paste. Add to this a table- 
spoonful of onion juice, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, 
pepper and salt to taste, and a tablespoonful of grated 
cheese. Mix well and let it get cold. Form balls out of the 
paste, put into a well buttered bag, and cook fifteen 
minutes. 

MUSHROOM PUDDING. 

Roll out a nice short crust, cut it in two. On one half 
lay small button mushrooms, properly cleansed ; sprinkle 
with a little salt and pepper ; put bits of butter over them, 
cover with the other half of pastry ; put into a buttered 
bag and cook fifteen minutes 



HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES 55 

TURNIP CUPS. 
Take nicely shaped round turnips, cut off the tops and 
scoop out some of the centres ; fill with green peas, put 
little bits of butter on the tops ; put the cups carefully into 
a well greased bag, so as not to upset them. Add cautiously 
about two tablespoonfuls of water and cook twenty minutes. 

ONION DUMPLINGS. 

Take as many onions as may be required, peel them, 
and make a deep incision across them ; put into this cut 
a piece of butter or dripping, salt, and pepper. Make a 
good short crust, roll it out, and cut into as many pieces as 
there are onions. Put an onion on each, and work up the 
paste as if making an apple dumpling. Put into a well 
greased bag and cook about an hour. 



CHAPTEE V 

PUDDINGS AND CAKES. 

With the exception of soup, an entire dinner can be 
cooked in " Papakukery " fashion, and, apart from other 
advantages, it will gain immensely in flavour and nutritive 
value from being thus cooked. Almost all puddings and 
sweet dishes can be cooked in paper bags, and are much 
improved in taste and goodness. 

APPLE PUDDING. 

Peel, core, and slice the apples. Make a good short paste 
crust, roll it out to a medium thickness ; lay the apples 
neatly on one half, cover thickly with castor sugar, add the 
juice of half a lemon, squeezed over the apples ; fold over 
the pastry, pinching the edges well together ; put into a 
well greased bag and cook fifteen minutes. 

APPLE PUFFS. 

Make half a pound of the finest flour perfectly smooth by 
passing it through a sieve. Roll half a pound of fresh butter 
in a cloth to free from moisture ; rub a piece into the 
flour with the finger-tips very thoroughly till it quite 
disappears ; add a well beaten egg, and roll out the paste on 
a stone slab with a glass rolling-pin ; a clean round bottle 
will answer if the only household roller is of wood. Put 
more butter in tiny bits over the paste ; dredge lightly 
with flour ; fold it up and roll it out ; let it stand three 
or four minutes. Repeat this, leaving it a few minutes each 
time, for four or five times. Then roll it out and cut into 
square pieces. Lay a few slices of apple on each, cover 

56 



PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 57 

with castor sugar and a little ground cinnamon, fold 
half the paste over, point to point, forming a triangular 
puff. Put the puffs into a buttered " Papakuk " bag 
and cook fifteen minutes. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

A plain, not too rich, paste crust is best for these. With a 
corer extract the core from the whole, unpared apple, 
which is less likely to break than one which has been 
peeled. Fill the hollow with powdered sugar and a little 
ground cinnamon, if the flavour is liked ; a little ground 
ginger makes a nice flavour, with the zest of a lemon or a 
pinch of mixed spice according to taste. Divide the paste 
into as many neat rounds as there are apples, put one apple 
on each round, work the paste smoothly over, wetting 
the edges to make them adhere. Place them in a well 
buttered " Papakuk " bag and cook in a moderate oven 
for forty minutes. 

STEWED APPLES 
are best cooked in a shallow tin or pie-dish, though they 
can be cooked placed simply in a well buttered bag. The 
apples are sliced, add a little lemon juice, sugar to taste, 
and a small quantity of water. Place in a well buttered 
bag, or put first into a pie dish which is slid into a bag — 
the last is really the best way. With or without the dish, 
cook for half an hour. The oven, after the first five minutes, 
must not be very hot. 

ECONOMICAL BREAD PUDDING. 

Put about a pound of stale bread into a basin and just 
cover with cold water. Leave it for an hour or two ; or 
over-night, if more convenient. Drain off the liquid, 
pressing the bread in a colander or a vegetable presser ; 
or press with the hand until free from moisture. Put 
into a basin, add two ounces of moist sugar, a quarter of 
a pound of cleaned sultanas or raisins, a teaspoonful of 
mixed spice, and one well beaten egg. Beat very thor- 
oughly, put into a thickly greased bag, and cook forty 
minutes. 



58 PAPEE-BAG COOKERY 



BREAD PUDDING. 

This is a richer pudding than the foregoing, but is very- 
light and digestible. Put stale bread to soak in just enough 
cold milk to cover. When quite soft, beat it well up, 
without pouring off any of the milk which may not have 
been absorbed by the bread. Add a quarter of a pound 
of sugar. Put into a well buttered bag and cook forty- 
minutes. 

GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 

Three breakfastcupfuls of bread-crumbs are mixed with 
half a pint of gooseberries and quarter of a pound of brown 
sugar. A little spice may be added, if liked. Mix in two 
ounces of butter or grated suet ; beat in one or two eggs. 
Put into a well buttered bag and cook forty-five minutes. 
Reduce the gas by one-half after the first five minutes. 

LEMON DUMPLINGS 

are made exactly in the same way as the foregoing, substi- 
tuting the juice of a grated rind of one large or two small 
lemons for the gooseberries, and mixing with one egg 
only. Form into balls, adding a little flour if the mixture 
is not sufficiently firm. Place into a buttered bag and cook 
for about fifteen minutes. 

JAM ROLY-POLY. 

This favourite nursery pudding is never so dainty as 
when cooked in a paper bag. In this way there is no risk 
of the jam " boiling out," to the disappointment of the 
little people to whom the jam is the chief part of the 
pudding. Make a nice, but not too rich, crust from vegetable 
lard and self-raising flour. Roll it out to an oblong shape, 
spread over with any kind of jam preferred, leaving a 
good two inches clear all round. Roll up the pudding very 
carefully, securing the edges by wetting and sifting flour 
over. Put in a thoroughly greased bag and cook thirty 
minutes. If any jam should chance to ooze out, it will be 



PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 59 

retained in the bag, and should be poured over the pudding 
when in the dish. 

RAISIN BLANKET. 
This is another nursery favourite. Roll out a light paste 
crust, as directed in the foregoing recipe. Sprinkle it over 
with large raisins, stoned and cut in halves ; cover with a 
thick layer of brown sugar ; squeeze the juice of a lemon 
over ; roll up, secure the ends, put into a well buttered 
bag, and cook thirty minutes. 

RICE PUDDING. 

For this pudding use flaked rice. Bring a pint of milk 
to the boil, add an ounce of loaf sugar, stir in one and a 
half or two ounces of flaked rice and boil a few minutes 
whilst stirring; take from the fire and allow to cook. 
When nearly cold, add two well beaten eggs, put into 
a thickly buttered bag, and cook thirty minutes, the heat 
of the oven being reduced after five minutes to less than 
half. Have ready a dish in which a layer of stewed fruit 
or jam has been placed, and turn the pudding out on the 
top of this. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

Flaked tapioca should be used for this, and it should 
be made in exactly the same manner as rice pudding. 
Both these puddings, and also semolina and ground rice, 
can be poured first into a buttered dish, and the dish put 
into a " Papakuk " bag. This secures a good appearance 
for the pudding, without losing the advantages of paper- 
bag cookery. 

FRUIT TARTS 

can be made in the ordinary fashion, and the dish containing 
the tart can be put into a bag to get the full advantages of 
the method. Or they can be made without dishes. Either 
a short crust or puff paste may be used, as may be pre- 
ferred. The paste is rolled out to a medium thickness and 
cut into two ovals or rounds. On one is laid the fruit — 
gooseberries, rhubarb, apples, black currants, red currants, 



60 PAPEK-BAG COOKEEY 

and raspberries, or any suitable fruit in season — sweeten 
the layer of fruit with castor sugar. A little lemon juice, a 
pinch of ground ginger, or cinnamon, are considered by 
many people to improve the flavour of rhubarb and apples, 
and a very little sherry is thought to bring out the flavour 
of red currants and raspberries, but much less flavouring of 
any kind is required in paper-bag cookery, for the bag re- 
tains the flavour so perfectly that it is easy to overdo any 
strong flavour. 

The fruit is then covered with the other piece of paste, 
pinch the edges of paste together, and ornament to taste ; 
put into a well buttered bag, bake for about twenty to 
twenty-five minutes, and serve with castor sugar sifted 
over. 

STRAWBERRY GATEAU. 

A sixpenny sponge or Madeira cake is the foundation 
of this summer sweet. Cut the top neatly off,. scoop out 
a deep hole, saving the cake to be used in making a Cabinet 
pudding. Fill the cavity with ripe strawberries, cover 
with sifted sugar put on the top ; pour over the whole a 
glass of sherry, mixed with a tablespoonful of strawberry 
syrup, and one of lemon juice. Let it stand to soak for a few 
minutes, then put it into a well buttered " Papakuk " bag, 
and place in a hot oven for ten minutes. Take out and 
serve at once, handing custard or whipped cream with it. 

CABINET PUDDING. 

Bring one pint of milk to the boil, stir in a cupful of 
cake-crumbs. The pieces cut out of the cake used for the 
Strawberry Gateau will be sufficient, finely crumbled. 
Stir for a few minutes, then lift off the fire, and when 
slightly cooled, add the well beaten yolks of three eggs, 
a quarter of a pound of raisins, cleaned and stoned, a quarter 
of a pound of candied peel, two ounces crystallised ginger, 
and two ounces of butter. Beat all together very thoroughly, 
put|into*a well buttered bag, and cook forty-five minutes, 
reducing ^the heat by half a few minutes after putting in 



PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 61 

the pudding. Beat up the whites of the eggs with a little 
sifted sugar and a few drops of essence of vanilla. When 
very stiff, pile it on the top of the pudding and serve at 
once. 

PLAIN SUET PUDDING. 

This pudding, whether intended to be eaten with meat 
or with jam or treacle, is infinitely superior cooked in a 
paper bag to the same pudding boiled or steamed. Mix 
one pound of self-raising flour with four ounces of chopped 
suet, preferably vegetable, and a pinch of salt. Mix to a 
stiff dough with water, put into a buttered bag and cook 
for forty-five minutes. This has quite a different flavour 
from a boiled suet pudding. 

SIMPLE PLUM PUDDING. 

Two heaped breakfastcupfuls of self-raising flour, one 
cupful of chopped suet, one cupful of raisins, stoned and 
cleaned, one of prunes, chopped and stoned, a little finely 
cut candied peel, one beaten egg, and enough milk to mix 
to a very stifl dough. Put into a well buttered bag and 
cook for about fifty minutes. 

ROBIN TARTLETS. 
Make a short crust paste, roll out, line some little patty 
pans, and fill with this mixture : one ounce of butter, melted, 
two ounces of ground rice, three ounces of castor sugar, 
one well beaten egg, a few drops of almond essence, or a 
spoonful of minced almonds. Put these into a " Papakuk " 
bag and cook fifteen minutes. 

GERMAN GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 

Two cupfuls of flour, two of bread-crumbs, four ounces 
of chopped suet, one teaspoonful of ground ginger, one pint 
gooseberries, washed, topped, and tailed, and two table- 
spoonfuls of golden syrup ; mix all well together, and 
make into a very stiff dough with a little milk ; put into 
a thoroughly greased bag and cook for an hour. 



62 PAPEK-BAG COOKEEY 

PALESTINE PUDDING. 

Mix six ounces of self-raising flour, four of sultanas, 
four of chopped suet, four of brown sugar, one dessert- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon. Beat up one egg with two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, mix to a stiff dough. Put into a 
well buttered " Papakuk " bag and cook forty-five 
minutes. 

DATE PUDDING. 

Mix six ounces of bread-crumbs, four of self-raising 
flour, three of grated suet, half a pound of dates, stoned 
and chopped, but no sugar. Moisten with a beaten egg, 
and, if necessary, a little milk, but do not make the mixture 
liquid. Put into a greased bag and cook for an hour. 

LANCASHIRE ROLY-POLY. 

This is a nice variety of a favourite children's pudding. 
Make a good short crust and roll it out into an oblong 
shape. Cut two apples into small pieces, and mix thoroughly 
with two ounces of sultana raisins, two tablespoonfuls of 
golden syrup, a teaspoonful of mixed spice, a little grated 
lemon rind. Spread this mixture on the crust to within 
an inch of the edge ; roll up, pinching the sides well to- 
gether in the process. Put into a greased bag and cook for 
an hour. 

PINEAPPLE PUDDING. 

Bring one pint of milk to the boil, sprinkle in enough 
flaked sago to make a thick batter. Cook for a few seconds. 
When cool, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, an ounce of 
castor sugar, and a teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Butter 
a " Papakuk " bag very thickly, pour in the pudding, and 
cook gently for thirty minutes. Meanwhile, open a tin 
of pineapple rings and lay them in a dish. Empty the 
pudding on the top of this ; have the whites of the eggs 
whisked very stiff with a little icing sugar and a drop 
or two of vanilla essence ; pile this on the top of the 
pudding and serve at once. 



PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 63 

SAGO PLUM PUDDING. 

Soak four tablespoonfuls of fine sago all night in a 
breakfastcupful of milk. Next day add a teacupful of bread- 
crumbs, two of self-raising flour, one of best raisins, 
cleaned and stoned, the grated rind of quarter of a lemon, 
one ounce of butter (melted), and a well-beaten egg. Put 
into a thickly buttered bag and cook one hour. 

RAISINS. 

This simple dish is much liked by children, and is very 
wholesome and nutritious. Choose large, fine raisins, put 
them in a buttered " Papakuk " bag with a cupful of 
water, and let them cook for about forty minutes. They 
are excellent for children, eaten with bread and butter, 
and act as a gentle laxative. 

PRUNES. 

These are also excellent for children. Wash the prunes 
carefully, then let them soak all night in enough water to 
cover them and the juice of a lemon. Next day add two 
ounces of sugar to a pound of prunes, put them into a 
greased bag, with the water and lemon juice, and cook 
forty-five minutes. This is also a pleasant and gentle 
laxative, and is generally much liked by children. 

LEMON PUFFS. 

Grate the rind of two fresh lemons, mix with ten ounces 
of castor sugar. Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff 
froth, and whisk all together to a very thick paste. Form 
into dainty balls, and place some distance apart in a thickly 
buttered " Papakuk " bag, and cook fifteen minutes. 

CASTLE PUDDING. 

Beat one ounce of butter and half a cupful of castor sugar 
to a cream ; add three well beaten eggs, and beat all well 
together. Then sift in gradually one breakfastcupful of 
self-raising flour and mix thoroughly. Put into a thickly 
buttered bag and cook for about thirty minutes. 



64 PAPER-BAG COOKEKY 

QUINCES. 

Core and cut into slices six quinces, put them into a 
greased " Papakuk " bag with two teacupfuls of sugar and 
one of water. Cook for three hours in a slow oven. They 
will then be tender and of a beautiful rich colour. They are 
not often met with, but cooked thus are a delicious fruit. 

CAKES 

are very dainty, and gain in flavour and richness when 
cooked in a paper bag. Many are cooked simply in the 
bag, but others must be put into a greased tin and then 
enclosed in the bag. 

LADIES' FINGERS 

are nice little cakes for afternoon tea. Beat two eggs very 
lightly, add one teacupful of sugar and a little essence of 
lemon. Add enough self-raising flour to make a firm dough. 
Roll out, cut into strips, put into a buttered bag, and cook 
fifteen minutes. 

GOLDEN CAKES. 

Beat half a pound of butter to a cream, add six ounces 
of sugar and the yolks of three eggs, and beat well ; then 
put in three ounces of chopped orange peel and one pound 
of self-raising flour. Mix well, divide into buns, put into 
a well greased bag, and cook twenty minutes. 

SHORTBREAD 

is delicious cooked in a paper bag. The following is the 
recipe of an old Ayrshire cook whose shortbread, is always 
considered unsurpassed. It is very rich, however, and the 
amount of butter may be reduced by one-half if considered 
extravagant or indigestible ; but if the recipe be followed 
exactly, a very delicious cake will be the result. 

Rub one pound of butter into one pound of flour. Rub 
it until it is like bread-crumbs. Then add a quarter of a 
pound of sugar and gradually work into a dough, which 



PUDDINGS AND CAKES 65 

can be rolled out thickly, cut into fancy shapes, put into 
a buttered bag, and cook for twenty minutes. If half a 
pound of butter to one pound of flour be used, the dough 
must be moistened with one beaten egg and two table- 
spoonfuls of cream. The first recipe, however, is for 
genuine Scotch shortbread. 

DOUGH CAKE. 

Get the baker to bring half a quartern of bread dough. 
Beat into it quarter of a pound of butter, half a pound 
of sugar, a quarter of a pound of sultana raisins, two 
ounces candied peel. Let it stand for half an hour, put it 
into a buttered " Papakuk " bag, and cook one hour. 

TEA-CAKE. 

Mix three-quarters of a pound of self-raising flour, half 
an ounce of butter, and a cup of milk into a light dough ; 
roll out, cut into round cakes, slip into buttered bags, and 
cook fifteen minutes. 

YORKSHIRE TEA-CAKES. 

Cream the white of one egg in as much butter and 
sugar together ; beat into the white of the egg as much 
ground rice and self-raising flour ; mix to a light dough 
with one tablespoonful of milk. Butter two plates, spread 
over the mixtures, put each plate into a " Papakuk " 
bag, cook fifteen minutes, spread one cake with warmed 
jam, put the other on the top, and serve hot. 

COCOANUT BUNS. 

Beat a quarter of a pound of butter and a quarter of a 
pound of sugar to a cream, then beat in two eggs, quarter 
of a pound of desiccated cocoanut, and one gill of milk ; 
stir in a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground ginger and 
three-quarters of a pound of flour ; butter some patty 
pans, half fill with the mixture, put into " Papakuk " 
bags, and cook twenty minutes. 



66 PAPEE-BAG COOKEKY 

SPONGE ROLL. 

Beat four eggs and one cup of sugar together for five 
minutes, stir in one cup of self-raising flour, put into an 
oblong greased tin, enclose this in a " Papakuk " bag, and 
cook ten minutes. Turn out and spread with heated jam, 
and roll up at once. 

AMERICAN COOKIES. 
Put four tablespoonfuls of sugar into a basin, pour over 
it three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, mix well together ; 
beat two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of milk and stir in ; 
add as much self-raising flour as will make a very stiff 
dough. Roll out a quarter of an inch thick, cut with a 
pastry-cutter into nice rounds, brush each over with milk, 
sprinkle thickly with sugar, slip into well buttered bags, 
and cook twenty minutes. 

LUNCH BUNS. 
Beat well together one egg, half a cup of sugar, and 
one teaspoonful of butter, add one cup of self-raising flour, 
and mix very thoroughly. Form into buns, put into a 
well greased bag, and cook fifteen minutes. 

CHERRY CAKES. 
Beat a quarter of a pound of butter and two ounces of 
sugar together till very light, add one egg, very thoroughly 
beaten, stir in by degrees half a pound of self-raising flour. 
Turn the dough out on a board ; chop two ounces of dried 
cherries finely, blanch and chop one ounce of sweet 
almonds. Roll out the dough, sprinkle over the cherries 
and almonds, and fold the dough together ; roll it out 
again and fold it again ; roll it out once more to half an 
inch in thickness ; cut into rounds ; put into a thickly 
buttered bag and cook ten minutes. 



PUDDINGS AND CAKES 67 

NURSERY TEA-CAKES. 
Mix well together half a cup of butter, one of sugar, 
half a cup of milk, two of self-raising flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of vanilla essence, two well beaten eggs. Shape into 
buns, put into buttered bags, and cook twenty minutes. 

CROPPER CAKES. 

Beat three ounces of butter to a cream with three ounces 
of sugar ; put half a pound of self-raising flour into a basin, 
and add it by slow degrees to the butter and sugar. Add 
a well beaten egg and a few drops of essence of vanilla. 
Make into a smooth dough, form into small cakes, place 
into a well buttered " Papakuk " bag, and cook fifteen 
minutes. 

FEATHER CAKE. 

Beat half a cup of butter to a cream, add two cups of 
sugar, and beat well ; add one cup of milk with one 
tablespoonful of baking soda dissolved in it ; three eggs, 
the yolks and whites beaten separately, one cup of flour 
with two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar mixed in it ; then 
add two more cups of flour without the cream of tartar. 
Beat very thoroughly. Put into a well buttered tin ; 
enclose the tin in a " Papakuk " bag and cook forty-five 
minutes. 

GINGER CAKE. 

These are particularly wholesome for children, and are 
an agreeable laxative. 

Take one pound of self-raising flour, and rub it well 
together with a quarter of a pound of sugar and half an 
ounce of ground ginger ; then add half a pound of golden 
syrup and a tablespoonful of honey. Melt three ounces of 
butter in a quarter of a pint of hot milk ; dissolve a tea- 
spoonful of carbonate of soda in the milk and add it to 
the other ingredients. It must be a very stiff dough. 
Form into flat cakes, slide into very thickly buttered 
" Papakuk " bags, and cook forty-five minutes. 



CHAPTER VI. 

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

For those who still hesitate whether to adopt paper-bag 
cookery or not, it may be as well to repeat the solid ad- 
vantages of this method. For one thing, it minimises 
labour and saves time, thus going far to solve the servant 
problem. The cook who has not the never-ending labour 
of cleaning saucepans and baking-tins, who has leisure for 
reasonable rest and recreation, is a contented being, not 
likely to give notice at awkward moments. The expense 
of most labour-saving domestic utensils prevents their 
adoption in households where means are limited, but the 
bags necessary for paper-bag cooking cost the merest trifle. 

Only those who live in small houses or flats know the 
misery of having each meal heralded by a violent smell of 
cooking, which invades every room, and robs the average 
person of all appetite ; the tenant of those uncomfortable 
dwelling-places known as " Maisonettes " knows only too 
well what it is to inhale the fragrance of the downstairs 
burned onion or frying bloater ; while the occupants of 
the lower maisonette sutler from audible and pungent re- 
marks upon the odours from their kitchen, remarks which 
frequently lead to friction. Now, paper-bag cookery does 
not smell. 

Paper bags are cheap. The young couple setting up 
modestly in life are spared the outlay of an expensive range 
of cooking utensils ; the occupant of cramped apartments 
has not to endure the obtrusive little kitchen in bed- or 
sitting-room, and the thrifty housewife has not the con- 
tinual necessity of replacing a worn-out saucepan or burnt- 
out frying-pan. And these things run into money. All 

68 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 69 

that is necessary for the equipment of the up-to-date 
paper-bag cook is, of course, a kettle for boiling water, 
a conservative boilerette (Welbank) for the cooking of 
these few dishes not amenable to paper-bag treatment, 
and an egg saucepan. For though eggs are delicious cooked 
in a paper bag, it would be an extravagance to light the oven 
up for that purpose alone. Perhaps a frying-pan might 
also be included, but the rest of the kitchen outfit may 
consist entirely of " Papakuk " bags. 

DOING WITHOUT A KITCHEN. 

With the aid of paper-bag cookery, the up-to-date 
householder may eliminate the kitchen altogether, thus 
gaining another room. The small flat at a moderate rent 
usually consists of one sitting-room, two bedrooms, a 
kitchen, and a bathroom. It is equally unpleasant to sit 
in the room in which one has just dined, or to take meals 
in the room where they have just been cooked. With a 
little contrivance and ingenuity, the kitchen may be 
transformed into a neat little dining-room, a gas stove 
erected in any convenient recess or in the bathroom, and 
with paper-bag cookery, nothing more elaborate will be 
needed. 

BEDROOM COOKERY. 

For the business woman, living in one room, ordinary 
cooking is out of the question, yet most landladies refuse 
to cook for their lodgers, except at a high charge, and 
restaurant living is expensive. Ordinary cooking, too, 
means more or less heat and odours, incompatible with 
keeping the one room fresh and neat. In this case, too, 
paper-bag cookery solves the difficulty. 

"WILD WEST" COOKERY. 

Paper-bag cookery has been seized upon with thankful- 
ness by a girl who went out to keep house for a brother 
in the " Wild West," and found the toil of cooking with 
rough and old-fashioned utensils beyond her capacity. So 
incessant were her labours, so unsatisfactory the results, 



70 PAPEE-BAG COOKEEY 

that she hailed with joy and gratitude a newspaper article 
and some bags sent her by a compassionate relative, and 
now writes triumphantly that all her cookery troubles 
are over. 

INVALID DIET. 

How weary invalids get of the eternal boiled 
whiting and boiled chicken is well known. The poor in- 
valid who besought his doctor's permission to have his 
whiting fried, and who, receiving it with the proviso it 
should be fried in water, burst into tears when the dish 
was set before him, would have been charmed with the 
fish cooked in a paper bag. A whiting, a chop, a fillet of 
chicken thus cooked are all as savoury as if fried, yet as 
light and digestible as when boiled. 

INVALID'S CHOPS. 

Trim every morsel of fat from the chop, and put it with- 
out water or seasoning into a very well greased bag. Cook 
it fifteen or twenty minutes according to the thickness, 
and serve it with any seasoning or sauce the doctor sanc- 
tions. 

INVALID'S CHICKEN. 

With a very sharp knife, cut neat fillets from the breast 
of a plump chicken ; brush each fillet over with oiled 
butter, put into a greased bag, and cook fifteen minutes. 

INVALID'S WHITING. 

Choose a good-sized but not coarse whiting ; have it 
filleted ; roll up each fillet and put them into a thickly 
buttered bag with one tablespoonful of milk. Cook ten 
minutes. 

INVALID'S PORRIDGE. 

This may be cooked in a buttered bag alone, or cooked 
in a dish enveloped in a bag. Both methods are excellent. 
For the first, take a pint of milk and add when boiling 
enough rolled oats to make a batter ; add salt to taste, 
and put into a well buttered bag and cook twenty minutes. 



MISCELLANEOUS EECIPES 71 

If a dish be used, the porridge may be made thinner, and 
must be cooked longer, about thirty minutes. If the 
ordinary medium oatmeal be used, it must be soaked in 
cold water overnight, in a pie-dish. Next morning, add 
as much more water as will be needed, add a little salt. 
Put the dish into a greased bag and cook forty-five minutes. 
This porridge is not suitable for invalids, but is excellent for 
children. 

BREAKFAST DISHES. 
There are a great many breakfast dishes, besides ham 
and eggs which are very much nicer cooked in a paper bag. 

LIVER AND BACON 

is one. Cut a calf's or sheep's liver into thin slices, flour 
both sides, sprinkle with salt and pepper ; put into a 
thickly buttered bag and cook for about ten minutes. 
Meanwhile, have ready as many thin rashers of bacon as 
there are slices of liver and put them in a bag five 
minutes before the liver is done. Dish both together 
on a very hot dish and serve immediately. 

BROILED KIDNEYS. 

This is another very savoury breakfast dish. Foreign 
kidneys answer very well ; skin them, cut in halves, and 
wrap each half in a thin rasher of fat bacon. Put them 
on a skewer to keep them in position, place in a buttered, 
bag, and cook fifteen minutes. 

A GERMAN BEEFSTEAK 

is very nice for a hearty breakfast eater. Mince finely half 
a pound of steak, removing skin, gristle, and fat ; mix 
well with a finely minced onion, half a teaspoonful minced 
parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. Flatten into an 
oblong shape, sprinkle on each side with flour, put into 
a well greased bag, and cook twenty minutes. Then cut 
a hole in the bag, drop in an egg, and cook three minutes 
longer. 



72 PAPER-BAG COOKEEY 

SAUSAGE ROLLS 

are also very good. Take four or five pork sausages, and 
wrap each when skinned in an oblong piece of pastry, short 
crust or puff pastry according to taste. Put into a well 
buttered bag and cook twenty minutes. 

RISSOLES 

make a nice change for breakfast, and are easily and 
quickly made. Roll out some light, shortcrust paste. Have 
ready some finely minced cooked meat, nicely seasoned, 
and mixed to a thick paste with gravy which has been 
thickened with flour. Put a little heap of this at regular 
intervals on half the pastry, cover with the other half 
and cut out each rissole with a pastry-cutter, pressing the 
edges well together. Put into a well greased bag, and cook 
twenty minutes. 

BACON AND MUSHROOMS 
are a favourite country dish. Half a pound of freshly 
gathered mushrooms should be trimmed, peeled, wiped, 
and put into a buttered bag with half a dozen thinly cut 
rashers of bacon, and a piece of butter rubbed together 
with a dessertspoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne 
pepper. Cook thirty minutes. 

SURPRISE SAUSAGES. 
Half a pound of sausage-meat is rolled into the shape 
of an egg, and a cupful of cold mashed potato is mixed 
with a well beaten egg and a little salt and pepper. Cover 
the sausage meat completely with the potato mixture, 
brush over with the beaten yolk of an egg, roll it in fine 
bread-crumbs, highly seasoned; put the whole into a 
greased " Papakuk " bag and cook fifteen minutes. 

BAKED HAM 

Take a corner or gammon of bacon, or a small picnic 
ham ; make a paste of flour and water and completely 
cover the ham with it, rolled out to about half an inch in 



MISCELLANEOUS EECIPES 73 

thickness. Put in a greased bag and cook in a moderate 
oven, allowing thirty minutes to the pound. When done, 
paste and skin come away easily and the flavour and 
aroma are exquisite. 

CODS ROE 
makes a nice breakfast dish. It is first boiled or steamed 
until thoroughly done. When quite cold, cut in thick, 
firm slices, brush over with oiled butter, dredge thoroughly 
on both sides on flour, sprinkle with salt and pepper, put into 
a well buttered " Papakuk " bag, and cook twelve minutes. 

EGG CUTLETS. 

Chop rather finely three hard-boiled eggs, add two 
tablespoonfuls of fine bread-crumbs, one of grated cheese 
and a little pepper and salt ; mix well and bind with the 
beaten yolk of two eggs. Shape into cutlets, put into a 
thickly buttered " Papakuk " bag, and cook ten minutes. 

EGG SAVOURY. 

Chop four hard-boiled eggs, mix with two rashers of fat 
bacon cut in dice, pepper, salt, and a sprinkle of sweet 
herbs ; put a slice of butter in a saucepan, add two table- 
spoonfuls of flour and stir together. Add slowly a gill of 
milk and stir till it boils. Then add the eggs and bacon 
and stir together till it is a thick mass. Turn out on a 
plate, and when cold form into balls. Put these into a 
thickly buttered bag and cook ten minutes. 

CURRIED EGGS 

are excellent, and very simply made. Hard-boiled eggs 
are cut in slices and put into a well greased " Papakuk " 
bag ; a thick white sauce is made, and a dessertspoonful of 
curry powder is stirred in. This is added to the eggs, and 
the bag put into a hot oven for six minutes. 

CREAMED EGGS 
are delicious. A shallow tin is well buttered, thickly 
sprinkled with seasoned bread-crumbs, and two or three 
eggs carefully broken in. Cover with more bread-crumbs, 
put bits of butter over the top, pour in a tablespoonful of 



74 PAPEK-BAG COOKEEY 

cream, or if cream cannot be afforded, a little milk thickened 
with cornflour and a morsel of butter. Slide this into a 
well greased bag and cook twenty minutes. 

Cheese savouries are particularly good, cooked paper-bag 
fashion. One of the most generally approved is 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Mix together four ounces of butter, four ounces of self- 
raising flour, four ounces of grated cheese, a little cayenne, 
a pinch of salt, and a well-beaten egg. Eoll out, cut into 
thin strips, and into one or two rings. Put inside a buttered 
bag, cook fifteen minutes, and serve with several straws in- 
side each ring. 

CHEESE FONDUE. 

Well butter a dish, put into it half a pint of milk, half 
a cup of fine bread-crumbs, quarter of a pound of dried 
cheese grated, one ounce of butter, and one well beaten 
egg ; season with salt and pepper, put into a greased bag, 
and cook forty-five minutes. 

CHEESE PASTRY 

is a delicious morsel. Make a nice flaky paste crust, roll it 
out and cut into two squares. Melt three ounces of grated 
cheese and one ounce of butter with a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. Spread this over one half of the paste, cover with the 
other, brush over with milk, put into a well greased bag, and 
cook fifteen minutes. 

FRIED CHEESE. 

Cut some slices of cheese, two inches long, one inch wide, 
and half an inch thick. Dry cheese may be used up in this 
way. Pour over the slices a little oiled butter, sprinkle with 
pepper, and leave for half an hour, turning once during 
that time. Make a thick batter, dip each piece in it ; lay 
in a buttered " Papakuk " bag and cook [fifteen ^minutes 
in a hot oven. 

CHEESE BISCUITS. 

This is a very simple but a very nice savoury. Split 
open several of Crawford's butter puffs, lay a slice of 
toasted cheese between the halves, put into a greased bag, 
and cook for ten minutes. 



MISCELLANEOUS EECIPES 75 

CHEESE PUFFS. 

Melt one ounce of butter in a small saucepan, add a 
tablespoonful of water, and when it boils sift in gradually 
two tablespoonfuls of self-raising flour, and three of grated 
cheese ; season to taste. Stir till the mixture leaves the 
saucepan, and then take off the fire. When cool, stir 
in a well beaten egg and set aside till quite cold. Then 
shape into balls, put into a buttered bag, and cook fifteen 
minutes in a fairly hot oven. 

MACARONI AND CHEESE. 

Break half a pound of macaroni into small pieces ; put 
into a greased bag with half a cup of water, and cook for 
half an hour. Then put into another bag which has been 
thickly buttered ; add four ounces of grated cheese and 
one ounce of butter, a little pepper and salt. Cook for 
ten minutes. 

Many people enjoy a little stewed fruit with breakfast, 
and all fruits gain in flavour cooked in a " Papakuk " bag. 
Prunes, a recipe for which has already been given, are 
particularly nice cooked in this way and so are other dried 
fruits. 

Put the fruit into a large basin, and pour boiling water 
over them, covering them completely. This plumps them 
up nicely. Cover with a plate and leave till cold. Then 
pour off the water, drain the fruit quite dry, and just cover 
with fresh, cold water. Replace the plate and leave till 
the morning. Then place in a large and very thoroughly 
greased bag, add to each pound of fruit two ounces of sugar 
and any flavouring preferred, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
one of sherry or of essence of vanilla or almond. Cook for 
forty-five minutes. 

BAKED APPLES 
are unsurpassed cooked in a paper bag. Simply wash the 
apples, or pare them if preferred, put into a greased bag 
with a gill of water, and bake forty minutes. Add sugar 
to taste. 

STEWED GOOSEBERRIES. 

Put into a greased bag with sugar and a gill of water 
and cook thirty minutes. Or they may be first put into 



76 PAPEE-BAG COOKERY 

a dish and the dish enclosed in a bag. Currants and rasp- 
berries are best thus cooked. Fruit tarts and meat pies 
when cooked in a dish which is afterwards put into a bag, 
must have some holes pricked in the bag. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING 

for eating with meat can be cooked in a " Papakuk " bag, 
but must first be poured into a shallow round tin which 
has had a slice of roast-beef dripping or of butter melted 
in it. Make the pudding in the usual way ; 4 to 6 ozs. of 
self-raising flour, a pinch of salt, two well beaten eggs, 
and enough milk or water mixed to make a batter about 
as thick as cream. Put the tin into a bag and cook 
twenty-five minutes. 

WARMING UP "LEFTOVERS." 

Paper-bag cookery is invaluable as a means of warming 
up cold meats. Apart from the various ways of serving 
up cold meat in hashes, stews, and other dishes, recipes for 
which have already been given, it is an excellent means of 
warming food which is required dished up in the same form 
as before. 

RE-HEATING ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

This is merely put into a well-greased " Papakuk " bag 
and placed in the oven to get thoroughly hot, the time 
depending on its weight ; it will then taste exactly as if 
it had been freshly roasted. If part of the leg has been 
already consumed, cold mashed potatoes should be pressed 
into the space left, and shaped so that when heated and 
browned the leg will appear untouched. 

DEVILLED MUTTON. 

This is never so nice as when cooked in a " Papakuk " 
bag. A cold shoulder of lamb is delicious when devilled. 
Cut over night large gashes in the meat, and fill these 
gashes with dripping or butter, in which has been mixed 
plenty of pepper, salt, dry mustard, and a few drops of 
lemon juice if that flavour is liked. Leave the meat until 



MISCELLANEOUS KECIPES 77 

it is nearly dinner-time, then put into a " Papakuk " bag 
and cook fifteen minutes. 

It is the same with other joints ; simply putting them 
into a greased bag and thoroughly heating them restores 
the flavour so completely that no one can tell that the 
meat has been previously cooked and then re-heated. This 
is possible only in paper-bag cookery ; in ordinary cooking 
reheated meat is always dry and flavourless. The exact 
time in the oven cannot be given, as it depends on the 
weight ; but as opening the oven door does not injure 
paper-bag cookery, a watch can be kept. Practice and 
experience are the safest guides, and the paper-bag cook 
will soon learn the exact time each dish requires. There 
will not be many failures, for a little too long will not 
dry up the food in the bags, and if it be underdone, it may 
be turned into another bag and put back into the oven. 
Always have the bags large enough ; they may split when 
the food is being put in if they are a tight fit. Also, unless 
the bag is full large for the contents, it is somehow awk- 
ward in dishing up. 

Some dexterity is required in freeing the food from the 
bag. If the paper is very brown, it may fall to pieces 
before it can be removed and bits of paper be found among 
the gravy. The bags should be intact and scissors used to 
split them open. If there is any fear of some paper remain- 
ing in the food, two hot dishes should be employed, one on 
which to place the bag while it is being removed, the other 
into which to turn the food when freed from the bag. 

Many other recipes might be given, but the cook who 
is interested in paper-bag cookery will be able to ex- 
periment for herself in fresh directions. All the recipes in 
the best-known cookery-books may be worked out in paper- 
bag cookery, for even those which cannot be put straight 
into a bag without injuring their appearance — for instance, 
cakes of the nature of plum cake, pound cake, seed, or 
Madeira — can be put first into tins and then into a " Papa- 
kuk " bag with the certainty that they will gain immensely 
in flavour and delicacy of taste.
