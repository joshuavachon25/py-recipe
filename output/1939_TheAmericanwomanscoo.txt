AT YOUR SERVICE 

Unless otherwise specified, all recipes are based on service for six 
persons. When cooking for more, multiply the ingredients in direa 
proportion. When fewer are to be served, divide by two or three 
as necessary. A full discussion of the problems of small quantity 
preparations is found in the chapter entitled "Cooking for Two"

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT 
FOOD 

USE OF RECIPES 

'T^O become a good cook requires more than the blind follow- 
^ ing of a recipe. This is frequently illustrated when several 
women living in the same community, all using the same 
recipe, obtain widely differing results. It is the reason so many 
cooks say, "I had good luck with my cake to-day," or "I had 
bad luck with my bread yesterday." Happily, luck causes 
neither the success nor the failure of a product. To become a 
good cook means to gain a knowledge of foods and how they 
behave, and skill in manipulating them. The recipe by itself, 
helpful as it is, will not produce a good product; the human 
being using the recipe must interpret it and must have skill in 
handling the materials it prescribes. 

Some of the lessons which the person desiring to become a 
good cook should learn are given in the following pages. They 
will not be learned all at once; but if they are gradually 
mastered, luck will play a less important part in culinary con- 
versation. 

Methods of Cooking Food 

Boiling is cooking in water at a temperature of 212° 
Fahrenheit. At this temperature water will bubble vigorously 
and as these bubbles come to the surface of the water steam 
is given oflF. (In mountainous regions, where the boiling-point 
is affected by atmospheric pressure, allowance must be made 
for the variation.) 

Simmering is cooking in water at a temperature of 180° F. 
to 210° F., or below the boiling-point of water. Only an oc- 
casional bubble is formed and rises slowly to the surface. 

Stewing is cooking in a small amount of water. The water 
may boil or simmer, as indicated for the food that is to be 
cooked. 

Steaming is cooking in the steam generated by boiling water. 

Pressure Cooking is cooking in steam at a pressure of 5 to 

1 



30 pounds and at temperatures 228° F. to 274° F. The rise 
in the temperature of the steam is caused by holding it under 
pressure. A special cooker is necessary for this cooking. From 
10 to 15 pounds (240° to 250° F.) is the pressure ordinarily 
used for household purposes. 

Broiling is cooking over or imder or in front of a fire of 
live coals or a gas or electric burner, or other direct heat. 

Oven Broiling is cooking in a broiler pan (either with or 
without a rack) that runs close under the heat in the broiling 
oven of a gas or electric stove. 

Pan Broiling is cooking in a hot griddle or pan greased only 
enough to prevent food from sticking. 

Baking is cooking in the oven. The temperature of baking 
varies with the food to be prepared. A slow oven should be 
from 250° F. to 350° F. A moderate oven shoul-d be from 
350° F. to 400° F. A hot oven should be from 400° F. to 
450° F. A very hot oven should be from 450° F. to 550° F. 

Poaching is cooking, for a short time, foods such as eggs or 
fish or mixtures of these foods, in water, milk, or stock, just 
below the boiling temperature. 

Oven Poaching is cooking in the oven in a dish set in hot 
water. The method is used for custards, souffles, and other egg 
mixtures of delicate texture which are cooked in the oven. 

Roasting as now used means the same as baking. Originally 
it meant cooking before an open fire and was similar to broil- 
ing. 

Frying is cooking in hot fat at a temperature of from 
350° F. to 400° F., depending on the nature of the food 
to be cooked. The article to be cooked is immersed in the fat. 

Sauteing is cooking in a small quantity of fat. The article 
to be cooked must be shifted from side to side to come in con- 
tact with the fat. Sauteing is a cross between pan broiling 
and frying. 

Braizing is a combination of stewing or steaming with bak- 
ing. The food to be braized is first stewed or steamed and then 
baked. 

Fricasseeing is a combination of sauteing with stewing or 
steaming. The food to be fricasseed is first sauted, then stewed 
or steamed. 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 

FiRELESS Cooking is cooking by heat that has been retained 
in a fireless cooker or insulated oven. It is accomplished by 
surrounding the thoroughly heated food with some insulating 
material to keep the heat from being lost rapidly. 

Methods of Mixing Food 

Stirring — ^Food is stirred by a rotary motion of the arm. 
The purpose of stirring is to mix thoroughly all ingredients. 

Beating — Food is beaten when the motion in mixing brings 
the contents at the bottom of the bowl to the top and there is 
a continual turning over and over of a considerable part of the 
contents of the bowl. The purpose of beating is to enclose a 
large amount of air. 

Folding In — Two foods are blended by putting the spoon or 
egg- whip vertically down through the foods, turning it under 
the mass, and bringing it vertically up. This process is repeated 
until the mixing is complete. The purpose of folding in is to 
prevent the escape of air or gases that have already been intro- 
duced into the mixture. 

Cutting in — A process used to blend fat with flour. It 
consists of cutting the fat into the flour w'ith a knife or two 
knives until it is distributed in as small particles as desired. 

Creaming — A rubbing together of fat and sugar, or a press- 
ing and beating of fat to soften it. 

Kneading — A stretching motion applied to dough when 
more flour is to be added than can be either stirred or beaten 
into the mixture; or used to make a dough smooth and even in 
consistency. 

Larding — A process of inserting match-like strips of salt 
pork about one-fourth inch in thickness into a dry meat or fish. 
These strips are called lardons, and are inserted either by mak- 
ing an incision in the surface and laying the lardon in the slash- 
ing or by the use of a larding-needle. The pork is clamped into 
one end of the needle and is threaded into the meat, as in any 
sewing process. 

COOKING BY TEMPERATURE 

For best results in cooking, exact temperatures should be 
known and followed. This requires the use of thermometers 



such as an oven thermometer or an oven-heat regulator for all 
sorts of baking, and special thermometers for sugar cookery, 
deep-fat frying, and roasting meats. 

Automatic Mechanical Oven-Heat Regulators which 
control temperature automatically by regulating the supply of 
heat are available in both gas and electric ranges. These are of 
great assistance alike to the experienced cook who would always 
obtain the same results with a given recipe and to the beginner 
w^ho has nothing to guide her in estimating the length of time 
required to get the slow, moderate and hot stages in her oven. 

Heat Regulators or Temperature Controls must al- 
ways be built into a gas range at the factory, and they must 
usually be built into electric ranges. For both types of stove 
they may be set to control a desired temperature automatically. 
Once set, they will maintain the temperature to within a few 
degrees Fahrenheit of that indicated, for an indefinite period. 

Time Controls are now quite common on modern ranges 
and even on fireless cookers, and, in combination with the 
temperature controls, they are almost uncanny, for they will 
turn heat on at a definite time and off again at another speci- 
fied moment. This makes it possible to put a meal in the oven 
or cooker in the morning and leave it with the assurance that 
it will start to cook at five o'clock in the afternoon and that 
the heat will be turned off again at Hye forty-five. As today's 
ovens and cookers are thoroughly insulated, the heat retained 
in the oven wall and in the food will complete the cooking. 
Moreover, since they are cooking on a decreasing heat, there 
is little or no danger of burning food, even if you should be 
delayed beyond the time when you planned to return. 

Thermometers That Can be Set in the Oven may be 
used where an oven heat regulator is not available. A small 
flash light is useful for reading them in a dark oven. 

Other Thermometers may be bought for candy and 
frosting, for deep fat frying, and for roasting meats. The cost 
of these thermometers is not large and they will soon pay for 
themselves in saving of time and food. 

If These Devices Are Not Available the next best thing 
is to seek to develop delicacy of feeling and knowledge of prac- 
tical tests which will detect differences in temperatures. This, 
of course, comes only with experience.

separated by a dash, (e.g. 3 50 — 375 or 30 — 40) it means that the 
temperature of the cooking medium or the length of the cooking 
period may range between these two extremes. 

"When the temperature figures are separated by the word "to" (e.g. 
400 to 350) it means that cooking is to be started at the tempera- 
ture first given and that the heat is afterward to be reduced to the 
second figure.

MEAT, POULTRY AND FISH 

ROASTED 

For table of oven temperatures, see page 5 

The number of minutes per pound which a roast requires for 
cooking at a given temperature is only an approximation. The 
accurate way of determining doneness is by the internal tem- 
perature shown on the meat thermometer inserted into the roast. 

All boned cuts require longer cooking time than those with 
the bones left in. Allow about 10 minutes per pound longer for 
cooking boned cuts. 

Many hams now on the market require shorter cooking time. 
For these hams, follow directions given with them. 

If one wishes to sear meat, the oven may be preheated (450°- 
475° F.) and the meat placed in the hot oven for 10 or 15 min- 
utes, then the temperature reduced quickly to 300° F. for the 
rest of the cooking period. Searing, however, does not keep in 
juices. The constant low temperature method is preferred.

Periods Required for Waterless Cookery of Vegetables 
The time required for waterless cookery varies somewhat with the 
age of the vegetable and the size of the pieces into which it is cut. 
It is generally safe to allow the maximum period given in the preced- 
ing tables, if the vegetables are young. For old, fully matured vege- 
tables, increase the time from ten to twenty minutes.

MEASUREMENTS 

Learn to Measure Accurately — All the measurements in 
this book, and in most modern cook-books and magazines, are 
level. It will not do to use a heaping teaspoon, tablespoon or 
cup when a level one is meant. To change proportions by- 
wrong measuring causes poor results, for example: 

Too much flour will make a cake dry and crumbly, bread 
solid and heavy, sauces thick and pasty. 

Too much fat will make cakes oily and may cause them to 
fall; it will make grease-soaked doughnuts and greasy gravies 
and sauces. 

Too much sugar will make a cake with a hard crust, or a 
sticky cake; it makes a soft, sticky jelly. 

Too much liquid will make a cake that falls easily. 

Too much soda gives a disagreeable taste and bad color to 
breads and cakes. 

Have Accurate Equipment for Measuring, as follows: 

A measuring-cup holding one-fourth quart and divided by 
ridges on one side into thirds and on the other side into fourths. 

A quart measure divided by ridges into fourths. Each fourth 
is a cupful. 

A standard tablespoon that holds one-sixteenth of a cup. 

A standard teaspoon that holds one-third of a tablespoon. 

A tested scale. 

To Measure Dry Material — Fill the cup, spoon or other 
measure to overflowing, then pass a spatula or the straight edge 
of a knife over the top, leveling the material. For an accurate 
half-teaspoon or tablespoon of dry material, fill spoon as above, 
then, owing to the difference in capacity of the tip and bowl 
of the spoon, divide the material in half lengthwise. 

To Measure Fat — An easy and accurate way to measure 
solid fat is by means of water. For instance, to measure ^ cup 
of solid shortening, fill a standard measuring cup % full of cold 
water, then drop in pieces of the shortening, pushing them 
under the water until the water level reaches the one-cupful 
mark. If Yz cup shortening is called for in the recipe, fill the 
cup one-half full of water, and so on for any quantity desired. 



14 



Another accurate method especially recommended for small 
quantities, is to pack the shortening into a standard measur- 
ing spoon and level off evenly with the straight edge of a 
knife. 

To Measure Liquids — ^Fill the measure with all it will hold.

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT STARCH 

Some of the foods which are used most frequently are rich 
in starch; for instance: 

Flour — ^White, whole wheat, graham, buckwheat, rice, corn, 
rye, barley. 

Vegetables — ^Potatoes, sweet potatoes. 

Legumes — ^Dried peas, dried beans, lentils. 

Breakfast Foods — ^Wheat, oat, corn-meal, rice, barley. 

Miscellaneous — Chocolate, cocoa, macaroni, vermicelli, 
spaghetti^ corn-starch, tapioca, sago, chestnuts. 

Starch-rich Foods Must be Cooked Thoroughly if they 
are to have fine flavor and be easily digested. This is because 
starch occurs in foods in the form of tiny, hard, dry grains 
which are not soluble in cold water and which are difficult for 
the digestive juices to act upon. When starch is cooked, it is 
easy to digest and much improved in flavor^ because cooking 
changes the form of the starch. 

"When Starch is Cooked in Liquid, the heat causes the 
starch grain to absorb liquid, swell and soften. When flour or 
corn-starch or any other finely divided meal is cooked in a 
liquid, it thickens the liquid. 

When Starch is Cooked by Dry Heat, that is, with very 



'USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 15 

little moisture, the heat, unless it is great enough to burn the 
starch, breaks down the starch grain and changes the starch to 
a substance called dextrin. Dextrin does not thicken liquid, 
but, like starch cooked in water, it has a better flavor and is 
easier to digest than raw starch. 

The baking of a loaf of bread illustrates both these changes. 
The starch in the dough in the inside of the loaf absorbs the 
water used in making the dough and swells and softens. The 
water in the dough on the outside of the loaf evaporates and 
the starch in the outer layers of dough is partly changed to 
dextrin. As a result, the crust has mpre flavor and is sweeter 
than the crumb, and has a different texture. 

In baking a potato, the water for cooking the starch is sup- 
plied by the potato itself. 

Points to be Observed in Cooking Starch-rich Foods 

1. Use enough water to soften all the starch present. This 
is especially important in cooking breakfast foods. 

2. Cook them for a long enough time to swell and soften the 
starch. A temperature as high as the boiling-point of water, 
212° F., is best for this cooking. 

3. Wlien flour or finely ground meal is to be mixed with a 
hot liquid, separate the particles before they reach the hot liquid, 
or gummy lumps with raw centers will be formed. This separa- 
tion of the particles of flour or meal can be accomplished by 
mixing the flour or meal with enough cold liquid to make a 
mixture as thin as cream, or by combining them with sugar 
or with fat before mixing them with the hot liquid. Lumpy 
gravies, sauces, mushes and puddings are caused by a failure 
to observe these precautions. 

4. A double boiler is the best utensil tb use in cooking cereals, 
mushes and starchy sauces because it does away with the danger 
of sticking and burning. The water in the lower part of the 
boiler should be boiling. 

Thickening Power of Flour or Corn-starch 

This is one of the most important things for a good cook to 
know. If the cook can tell how much flour or corn-starch to 
use to make sauces or pastes of any desired thickness, and knows 
how to mix and cook these sauces and pastes to make them 



i6 



smooth, velvety and fine in flavor, he or she has learned one of 
the hardest cooking lessons and is in possession of information 
that will help in making a great variety of dishes. 



WITH EACH CUP OF LIQUID: 

Yz tablespoon flour or ( 
Yz teaspoon corn-starch ( 

1 tablespoon flour or | 

1 teaspoon corn-starch ) 



2 tablespoons flour or 
2 teaspoons corn-starch 



3 tablespoons flour or 
1 tablespoon corn-starch 



4 tablespoons flour or 
4 teaspoons corn-starch 



Makes a very thin sauce, which may 
be used in making thin cream soups. 
Makes a thin sauce, which may be 
used in making cream soups of aver- 
age' thickness. 

Makes a medium sauce, which may be 
used for creamed meats or vegetables, 
scalloped dishes, gravies or other 
sauces where a medium thickness is 
desired. It has about the thickness 
of heavy cream. 

Makes a thick sauce, which may be 
used for creamed meats or vegetables, 
scalloped dishes, gravies or sauces 
where a thick sauce is desired. A 
sauce containing this amount of flour 
has considerable body and spreads 
rather than runs. 

Makes a paste when cold. This 
sauce may be used in making mixtures 
for croquettes, soufiles, blanc manges 
and similar puddings. 



When the Liquid Used is Milk, use a little more milk or a 
little less starch than for a water sauce, because milk already 
contains about 12 per cent, solids. 

When the Liquid Used is Acid, as vinegar, a fruit- juice or 
tomatoes, the hot acid acts on the starch and gradually changes 
it, just as dry heat does, to dextrin. Dextrin has not the 
thickening power of starch. Therefore, when an acid liquid 
is to be thickened, more of the thickening agent may be needed, 
and the time for cooking may be shortened. No statement can 
be made as to exact differences because acids differ greatly in 
strength. 

■ When the Flour is Browned, the dry heat changes part 
of the starch to dextrin and the flour may lose a considerable 
part of its thickening power. Either more browned flour must 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 17 

be used than uncooked flour or browned flour may be used 
for color and uncooked flour for thickening. 

Corn-starch Requires Longer Cooking Than Flour, 
and a quickly cooked corn-starch mixture always has a raw 
taste. 

If a Sauce is Too Thick, it can be thinned without trouble 
by adding more liquid. 

If a Sauce is Too Thin, it must be thickened by adding 
more of the thickening agent and by recooking it. A starchy 
sauce or a cream ^oup is always thinner when hot than when 
cold. Even the amount of cooling which occurs in transferring 
a starchy sauce, gravy or soup from the cooking utensil to the 
serving dish perceptibly thickens it. This must be taken into 
account in making creamed dishes of various kinds. 

If a Sauce is Lumpy, because proper precautions have not 
been taken in mixing and cooking the thickening agent with 
the liquid, the sauce should be strained; but such a sauce never 
has the creamy, smooth texture of a well-made one. 

Methods of Combining Flour or Corn-starch 

with Liquids 

When Little or No Fat is Used — Heat three-fourths of 
the liquid. Stir the remainder of the liquid gradually into the 
thickening agent. If sugar is used it may be mixed with the 
thickening agent before the liquid is stirred in or added to the 
sauce after the thickening is completed. Stir into the thicken- 
ing agent at first only enough of the cold liquid to make a 
thick batter. Beat this batter until smooth and free from 
lumps, then add the rest of the cold liquid. The mixture should 
be about as thick as medium cream. Beat this gradually into 
the hot liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture 
is thickened. If fat is used, it may be added at this time. After 
thickening, the sauce may be cooked in a covered double boiler 
with occasional stirring. 

When Amount of Fat Equals or Exceeds Amount of 
Thickening Agent — ^Melt the fat, add the flour or corn-starch 
and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly blended. This 
is called a roux. Stir in the liquid, a little at first, then inmie- 
diately enough to thin the roux perceptibly and finally the re- 



i8 

mainder. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick. Complete 
cooking in a double boiler^ stirring occasionally. 

Or 

Heat the liquid; cream together the fat and thickening agent; 
add this modification of roux to the hot liquid and stir con- 
stantly while the fat melts and the particles of flour or corn- 
starch are being spread through the liquid and cooked. Com- 
plete cooking in a double boiler, stirring occasionally. 

Dishes That Have a Sauce Foundation 

A variety of dishes can be made by a person who is familiar 
with the thickening power of flour and corn-starch and with 
methods of combining them into sauces. There are two founda- 
tion sauces: 

A White Sauce is one made from milk or white stock or 
part of each, thickened with plain flour or corn-starch. 

A Brown Sauce is one made from milk or water or brown 
stock and thickened with browned flour or part browned and 
part plain flour or corn-starch. 

The following typical dishes have a sauce foundation: 

Cheese Sauce — ^To each cup white sauce of desired consist- 
ency, add 54 cup shaved, grated or crumbled cheese and stir 
imtil cheese is melted. 

Cream Soups, Purees and Bisques — To each cup of very 
thin or thin white sauce, add 2 cups of vegetable, meat or fish 
pulp. 

Creamed Dishes — ^To each cup of medium or medium to 
thick white sauce, add 1 to 1J4 cups vegetables, meat, fish or 
hard-cooked eggs cut in pieces. 

Scalloped Dishes — ^To each cup of medium to thick white 
sauce, add 1 to 2 cups cooked vegetables, meat, fish, hard-cooked 
eggs, cooked macaroni or rice; put into a baking dish, sprinkle 
w;ith buttered crumbs and bake until brown. 

Croquette Mixtures — ^The foundation of most croquettes 
is white sauce or brown sauce. When this type of croquette 
is made, to each cup of very thick sauce use 1 to 2 cups of finely 
divided cooked meat, fish, hard-cooked eggs or vegetables. 
When the mixture is cold, it will easily shape into croquettes. 

Souffle Mixtures — ^Many souffles are made from a founda- 
tion of thick or very thick white sauce to which is added some 
seasoning or flavor such as cheese, vanilla, sugar, or some chopped 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 19 

food and raw egg-yolk. Beaten egg-white is folded in and the 
mixture is ready to pour into a baking-dish. All souffles are 
baked with the containing dish standing in hot water. With 
a knowledge of white sauce and Qgg cookery, souffles are very 
simple to make. No attempt is being made to give at this point 
complete directions for making souffles, but only to show how a 
knowledge of one part of cooking will help in the making of 
many dishes and will make the whole problem of cooking 
simpler and more interesting. The most common souffles hav- 
ing a white sauce foundation are: 

Cheese Souffle — ^To each cup of thick to very thick white 
sauce, add % cup grated cheese, 2 egg-yolks and seasoning. 
Cook until the cheese is melted. Then fold in the beaten egg- 
whites, and the souffle is ready to bake. 

Meat or Fish Souffle — ^To each cup thick to very thick 
white sauce add 1 cup minced meat or vegetable, 3 egg-yolks, 
and the beaten whites of 3 eggs and bake for thirty minutes at 
375° R 

Chocolate Souffle — ^To each cup thick white sauce, add 
2 ounces grated chocolate, 5/3 cup sugar, and 3 egg-yolks; cook 
until the chocolate is melted. Fold in the beaten whites of 3 
eggs and bake for thirty minutes at 375° F. 

Vanilla Souffle — ^To each cup very thick white sauce, 
add Y;} cup sugar, Yz teaspoon vanilla, 2 to 3 egg-yolks. Fold 
in beaten whites of 2 to 3 eggs and bake for thirty minutes at 
375° F. 

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT SUGAR 

Sugars are useful in cooking (1) because of their flavor, or 
the efiFect they have in modifying or intensifying other flavors; 
(2) because of their texture, or the changes they make in the 
texture of other foods; (3) because they help in preserving 
other foods, especially fruits. 

Use of Sugar in Flavoring Foods 

Sugars Not Equally Sweet — ^Maple sugar, brown sugar 
and molasses, weight for weight with white sugar, are a little 
less sweet than white sugar. Corn sirup or glucose, weight for 
weight with white sugar, is only about three-fifths as sweet as 
white sugar and may be used to reduce the sweetness of white 
sugar. Many persons prefer this modified sweetness. 



20 

Foods Taste Sweeter Hot Than Cold — ^This accounts 
for diflFerences in the amounts of sugar used in making frozen 
desserts and other desserts. 

Some Sugars Contain Special Flavors, for example: 
maple sugar, brown sugar^ molasses, honey. 

Sugar Brings out or Modifies Natural Flavors — ^It 
makes bitter chocolate and fruit acids more mellow and agree- 
able in flavor. It brings out flavor in bland foods like cereals^ 
breads, milk and some mild-flavored vegetables. 

"yC^ays in Which Sugar Affects Texture of Foods 

In CakeSjj used in right proportions, sugar helps to make 
Uiem tender and light. Too much sugar makes cake tough 
and heavy. 

In Breads, used in right proportions^ sugar helps to make 
them light. Too much sugar makes bread coarse in texture. 

With Fruit Juices, used in right proportions, makes fruit- 
juice jelly. Too much sugar makes jelly "wine off" and makes 
it soft and sticky in texture. Too little sugar necessitates over- 
cooking, impairs flavor and gives a tough texture. 

In Beaten Egg White, sugar helps the egg to hold air and 
remain stiflF. Too much sugar makes the egg white flatten out 
and settle. 

Approximate Amounts of Sugar for Various 
Common Dishes 

Ice creams — 2 to 4 tablespoons to 1 cup mixture. 
Custards (not frozen) — 1 to 2 tablespoons to 1 cup milk. 
Cakes — One-half as much sugar as flour. In chocolate cakes, three- 
quarters as much sugar as flour. 
Meiongues — 1 to 5 tablespoons to 1 egg white. 
Frostings — 1 to 3 cups to 1 egg white. 
Breads — 1 tablespoon or less to 1 cup flour, if any is used. 
Muffins — 2 tablespoons or less to 1 cup flour, if any is used. 

CARAMEL 

1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup boiling water 

Put the sugar into a pan and melt slowly over direct heat. 
Cook until dark brown, being careful not to scorch. Add the

sure that the water is hot. Cold water will make the hot sugar 
spatter.) This will keep indefinitely in a covered glass fruit 
jar and is a popular flavoring for desserts, soups, meat sauces 
and confectionery. 

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FATS 

The cooking and table fats available for use in the modern 
household range from liquid oils to hard fats. The source may 
be vegetable, meat, milk or a combination of these. 

Cooking and Table Fats Classified as to Sources 

Oils Solid Fats 

(Vegetable Product) (Milk Product) 

OHve oil Butter 

Cotton seed oil (Animal Product) 

Corn oil L^rd 

Other salad combinations Drippings as from bacon, suet, 

(Milk Product) chicken, beef, etc. 

Cream (Vegetable Product) 

Vegetable shortening compounds

Cooking and Table Fats Classified as to Use 

Fats are often classified as to their use: (1) for table use (2) 
for shortening, and (3) for frying. Many of them belong 
to two or all of these groups, while others are limited to one. 

Oils — Oils are both salad and cooking fats. As salad oils 
they are chosen for their flavor and smoothness in salad dress- 
ings. Those made of cotton seed, corn and peanut oil — alone 
or in combination with olive oils — are less expensive than pure 
olive oil. From the labels, the purchaser will know just which 
type she is buying. 

Oils for shortening are becoming increasingly popular because 
of their convenience. They are easily measured; they do not 
need to be creamed or melted. 

For frying, particularly deep fat frying, cotton seed and corn 
oils are practical and inexpensive. They do not smoke and burn 



22 

easily and, properly cared for, they can be used over and over 
again. 

Solid Shortenings and Cooking Fats — ^Lard and meat 
drippings for shortening and cooking date from the time when, 
all fats were prepared in the home. 

Lard is solid without being hard to handle in doughs, and has 
an established reputation for pastry. 

Fat from chickens and other poultry is highly prized for caKe 
making. 

Bacon, ham and sausage fats are too highly seasoned for any 
but limited use but are excellent for sauteing any food where 
their seasoning is desirable. 

Drippings are not possible for deep fat frying, because they 
burn so easily; unless they are clarified and combined, when they 
become a good mixed fat. They may be used for sauteing or in 
seasoning. 

In the solid vegetable compounds, vegetable oils — cottonseed, 
corn, and sometimes peanut — are solidified by a special process. 
This gives certain characteristics of both the original oil and. 
the solid fat, i.e.: they do not smoke or burn except at a high, 
temperature. This makes them desirable for deep fat frying. 
They do not easily melt which makes pastry making easy in ordi- 
nary temperatures. 

Butter — Probably butter will never lose its place as the 
favorite for eating. Its texture and flavor are particularly 
satisfactory. For certain types of cooking also, it is desirable, 
notably in sauces, and in some baking where its flavor becomes 
a part of the flavor of the dish. 

Margarines — ^The nut and oleo margarines are less expen- 
sive than butter but are nicely flavored and salted for table use. 
They should not be considered a substitute but rather another 
product suitable for the same use as butter. In the manuf act- 
wre of these products, liquid fat, either of animal or vegetable 
source, is churned with milk. The oil may be principally olein 
from meat source, giving the name oleo margarine; or it may 
be derived from peanuts, coconut or other nuts, making a true 
vegetable margarine. They are purchased uncolored to dis- 
tinguish them from butter, but they may be easily colored at 
home for table use. 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 23 



Shortening 

The term sKortening includes fat of any kind that is used 
in pastry, doughs, and batters. Any clean, sweet fat may be 
used. The best known and most commonly used are butter, 
solid vegetable fats, margarine, salad and cooking oil, lard and 
drippings* In general they may be used interchangeably for 
"shortening" in a recipe, remembering the difference in flavor, 
and that since some contain more water than others more fat 
is needed to give the same shortening quality. 

How to Try Out or Render Fat 

Every bit of fat from scraps of meat, bacon drippings, roasts, 
soups and poultry may be made into a mixture useful for gen- 
eral cooking purposes. The scraps should be "tried out" to- 
gether. The proportion of soft fats to hard fats will usually be 
enough to make of the whole a good medium fat. 

Chop the fat into fine pieces or run it through a meat- 
grinder. For each pound of fat allow one-half cup of milk. 
Cook in the top of a double boiler, or in a kettle set over water, 
until the fat is melted. Strain through several thicknesses of 
cheesecloth laid over a strainer. 

Fat may be tried out in exactly the same way without the 
use of the milk, but milk improves the flavor and texture of 
the product. Sweet, sour or buttermilk may be used. 

If the crisp cracklings left after straining are of good flavor 
and color they may be substituted for other fats in various 
dishes, notably in corn-meal and graham-flour mixtures, hashed 
brown potatoes, corn -meal mush that is to be fried, and any 
kind of baked hash. 

How to Clarify Fat 

If fat that has been tried out from scraps and drippings needs 
to be clarified, let it harden, remove it from the container, 
scrape away and discard any sediment that has settled in the 
bottom of the cake and melt it by pouring boiling water over 
it. Boil this mixture thoroughly, strain through several thick- 
nesses of cheesecloth placed over a strainer, and set away to cool. 
When the fat is cold, remove the solid cake from the liquid. 
Discard the impurities in the bottom of the cake. If this 



24 

process is repeated two or three times, a cake of clean fat may be 
obtained. 

If fat acquires, through use, a slightly burned or disagree- 
able flavor, melt it and for each pound or pint add a medium- 
sized potato cut in quarter-inch slices. Heat gradually. When 
the fat ceases to bubble and the potatoes are well browned, 
strain the fat through several thicknesses of cheesecloth placed 
over a strainer, and set away to cool. When ready to use, 
scrape away and discard sediment from bottom of cake. Po- 
tato helps to clarify fat as well as to purify it, for the potato 
is porous and gathers into its pores much of the sediment in 
the used fat. 

How to Care for Fats 

Since the four factors that are instrumental in making fat 
rancid are light, moisture, air and warmth, all fats should be 
kept in a dark, dry, cool place and as far as possible away from 
air. 

Oils, particularly, are affected by air. If oil is bought in 
quantity and used a little at a time, it should be transferred 
from the large container to small ones. Each container should 
be filled completely full to exclude air, and should be sealed or 
stoppered. The containers should be kept in a dry, cool place, 
but not so cold that the contents will congeal. The top shelf 
of the refrigerator is usually satisfactory. 

Deep Fat Frying 

Fats for deep fat frying, should be capable of being heated 
to a high temperature without smoking or burning. Smoking 
impairs the flavor, the digestibility and the durability of fat. 
A fat should be capable of being used over and over again, but 
everytime the fat is used the smoking temperature will become 
lower, because of the amount of crumbs or other foreign matter 
which escapes from the food into the fat, unless the fat is always 
strained carefully after frying and clarified frequently. 

Vegetable Fats and Oils are used increasingly for frying. 
They have high smoking temperatures. They can be used over 
and over again and are not likely to burn. They absorb prac- 
tically no odor from the food so can be used for all sorts of 
foods. They are, perhaps, the best all around fats for general 
use in frying. See photographs opposite.

Olive Oil has a comparatively low smoking temperature. 
This is partly compensated for, however, by the fact that it 
produces smoke slowly and the smoke is non-irritating. It has 
more decided flavor than the other vegetable oils. 

Lard must be used with great care to avoid overheating, and 
must be well clarified after each time of using. It has a rather 
low smoking temperature, smokes rapidly and produces an 
irritating smoke. Like all animal fats, it absorbs strong odors 
from foods. 

Utensils for Frying 

1. A deep iron bowl or scotch kettle. The bowl has one 
advantage over the flat-bottomed kettle; the sediment from 
food sinks into the curve of the bowl and does not adhere to 
food. 

2. A wire basket that fits loosely into the kettle. This is to 
lift food into and out of the kettle. A skimmer will do this 
but it is not so convenient. 

3. A long-handled spoon or fork to hold the basket out of 
the fat while the food is draining. 

4. A pan large enough to hold the basket while it is being 
emptied or filled. 

5. A large pan lined with soft paper on which to drain the 
food that has been fried. 

6. A thermometer for testing the temperature of the fat. 

Directions for Frying 

1. Put enough fat into the kettle to submerge to a depth 
of one or two inches the articles to be fried. Do not fill 
kettle more than three-fourths full of fat. The fat in an 
over-full kettle may bubble over and catch fire. 

2. Heat fat gradually to the desired temperature, which will 
be between 300° and 400° Fahrenheit, always, if possible, below 
the smoking point of the fat. 

3. Put only moderate amounts of food into the fat* at one 
time, because (a) when the very hot fat cooks the food it 
causes the moisture in the food to boil and this vigorous bub- 
bling may cause the fat to bubble over the edge of the kettle, 
with risk of fire; and (b) too much food may so cool the fat 
as to delay the cooking and increase absorption of fat thus 
making a greasy product. 



26 

4. When the food is cooked to the desired brown color, re- 
move at once, drain over the kettle for a few seconds, then 
place on soft paper to finish draining. 

5. After frying is completed, let fat cool until it is safe to 
handle, then strain through several thicknesses of cheesecloth 
placed over a strainer. Clarify it frequently, after each time 
of using, if possible, as it will lengthen the lifetime of the fat. 

If fat used in frying is not overheated, and if it is frequently 
clarified, it may be used over and over again, even if the smok- 
ing temperature is comparatively low. 

If fish is well egged and crumbed before being fried, it will 
not seriously flavor the fat in which it is fried and the fat is 
then useful for frying foods other than fish. 

Testing Fat for Frying 

Fats should never be brought to the smoking point as a test 
of heat. Use a thermometer or drop into the fat a one-inch 
cube of bread from the soft part of the loaf. Judge the heat 
of the fat by the length of time it takes the bread to brown. 

1. If the fat is the right temperature for large pieces of raw 
food — breaded chops, etc., — (3 50°-375° F.) it will take from 
1 to 1 54 minutes, for bread to brown. 

2. If the fat is the right temperature for smaller pieces of 
raw food or raw batters and doughs (360°-390° F.) the piece 
of bread will brown in 50 to 60 seconds. 

3. If the fat is the right temperature for most cooked foods — 
croquettes, fish balls, etc., (375° to 390° F.) the bread will 
brown in 40 to 50 seconds. 

Have the Right Temperature in Frying — ^If fat is too 
hot, it scorches the food, or does not cook it through, or spoils 
the fat. If it is too cool, the food becomes soaked with fat. Fats 
of low smoking temperature will naturally soak into food a 
little more than fats of high smoking temperature, because the 
food must remain longer in the fat. 

Egging and Crumbing Foods for Frying 

Except in the case of foods like doughnuts, fritters, potatoes 
and fried breads, foods are ordinarily either egged and crumbed 
or dipped in an egg batter before being fried. This is because 
the egg or egg batter hardens in the hot fat, making a case 
about the food which keeps it from becoming fat soaked. 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 27 

For crumbing, use dried bread crumbs rolled and sifted or 
soft crumbs forced through a strainer. 

Break an egg into a shallow plate and beat it with a fork 
only enough to mix the yolk and white and not enough to beat 
air into it. Blend into the mixed egg two tablespoons water for 
each egg. 

Place some crumbs on a board. Roll the food to be fried in 
the crumbs, covering all parts with crumbs. 

Dip the crumb-covered food into the egg bath, being careful 
to cover every part with egg. 

Lift food from egg with broad-bladed knife and roll again 
in crumbs. 

Let stand a few moments to dry. The food is then ready 
for frying. Foods may be egged and crumbed several hours 
or even a day before being fried. 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT EGGS 

Eggs Help to Bind Foods Together 

Eggs Bind Fats and Liquids Together — ^Fats and liquids 
mixed together tend to separate very quickly. When egg is 
added to this mixture, it is possible, under right conditions, to 
secure a very intimate mixing of the fat and liquid. The best 
known household illustration of this is the combination of oil, 
vinegar and egg in mayonnaise dressing,- which produces mix- 
ture that will keep for a long time. In the case of French dress- 
ing, the oil and acid can often be held together for an hour 
or longer if a small amount of egg-white is added. 

Eggs Help to Combine Ingredients in Batter and 
Dough — ^Although many batter and dough mixtures, such as 
cakes, muffins, pancakes,^ and breads, may be and often are 
made without eggy the use of egg materially improves them. 
Egg brings about a very intimate mixing of fat and liquid not 
only with each other but also with the other ingredients present. 
This gives the product fineness of grain, particularly in mix- 
tures containing fat, and increases its lightness of texture. Cake, 
fancy yeast breads, such as zwieback, brioche, rusks and fancy 
rolls, and quick breads, such as delicate muffins, owe a part o£ 
their delicacy of texture to the presence of eggs in the mixture. 

Egg Increases Power of Batter or Dough to Hold Fat 
— ^By causing a more intimate mixing of fat with other ingre- 



28 

dients, the egg in a batter and dough mixture will permit the 
addition of more fat. If a cake is so rich that it has a tendency 
to fall, the addition of another egg may cure the difficulty. If 
it is not rich enough, yet falls when more fat is added, putting 
in another egg permits the use of more fat. If richer mufiins 
are desired, the same rule holds good; eggs as well as fat may 
need to be added if the product is to retain its lightness. In 
fancy yeast breads such as zwieback, brioche, rusks and fancy 
rolls, the large amount of fat present does not reduce the light- 
ness of the mixture, in part at least because of the effects of the 
egg present. 

Egg Increases Power of Batter or Dough to Hold 
Liquid — ^Egg causes the liquid to be distributed in smaller 
particles throughout a batter and dough mixture. This makes 
it possible for the mixture to hold more liquid, without inter- 
fering with its lightness, than it could hold if the eggs were 
absent. Therefore, a bread or cake dough made with egg can 
be made softer than one in which egg is not used. This adds 
to the delicacy of the product. The popover is the most in- 
teresting illustration of a batter that is very light in spite of the 
large amount of liquid present. 

Eggs Help to Give Lightness and Looseness of Texture 

This property is due to the presence in egg of a tenacious, 
gluelike or viscous substance called albumin. Albumin has the 
power of holding air beaten into it, or gases formed in the mix- 
ture containing it, and of stretching as a result of this. 

Air-Holding Power of Egg Reduced by Fat — Egg-yolk 
is very rich in fat. This is the reason that egg-white is better 
than the yolk for giving lightness and looseness of texture, and 
accounts for the direction, familiar to every housekeeper, not 
to permit any of the yolk to escape into the white when separat- 
ing eggs, if the white is to be beaten stiff. In cakes in which 
the air-holding quality of egg-white needs to be used to great- 
est advantage, the egg-white is beaten alone and is folded lightly 
into the mixture at the last minute, so that the fat in the mix- 
ture may not reduce its viscosity. 

Air-Holding Power of Egg Increased by Sugar — ^In 
limited amounts sugar increases the tenacity or viscous properties 
of egg. This fact is interestingly illustrated in cakes, where the 
addition of sugar, within limits, increases the lightness of the 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 29 

cake. When sugar is added to beaten egg-white, in limited 
amounts, it increases the air-holding property of the egg, and 
the meringue is lighter than the beaten egg alone. When the 
sugar is added to unbeaten egg-white, in limited amounts, and 
the two are beaten together, not only can the product be made 
very light but a meringue made in this way holds the air for 
a much longer time than when it is made by beating the egg 
first. 

Eggs Thicken Liquids, Making Custards 

The value of eggs in custard making is due to the fact that 
raw eggs are fluid and readily mix with water or milk. When 
the mixture containing the egg is heated, the particles of egg 
become solid and the liquid is thus thickened.

Effects of Temperature on Eggs 

The texture of eggs cooked alone or in custard mixtures is 
directly affected by the temperatures at which they are cooked. 

Cooked at 180° to 200° Fahrenheit (below the boiling-point 
of water) 5 the egg-white is firm but delicate and very tender 
and friable or easily broken apart. The egg-yolk is tender and 
salve-like. 

Cooked at 212° Fahrenheit (at the boiling-point of water), 
the egg-white is firm, but somewhat tough. The egg-yolk is 
mealy. 

Cooked at 3 50° to 400° Fahrenheit (the temperature of fat 



30 

hot enough for frying) , the egg-white is leathery where touched 
by the fat, and the yolk is leathery where touched by the fat. 

Why Custards Whey or Curdle 

Custards usually whey or separate or curdle because they are 
cooked at too high a temperature or too long a time. Milk that 
is a little sour may cause curdling of a custard. 

The best way to prevent wheying, separating or curdling is 
to regulate the temperature and time of cooking all custards by 
cooking them over or surrounded by water slightly below the 
boiling-point, by removing them from the heat when they are 
done, and by being sure that milk uised in making them is en- 
tirely sweet. 

If a soft custard begins to whey, separate, or, as it is usually 
called in this case, curdle, it should be removed immediately 
from the heat. The pan containing it may be set into a pan 
of cold water, and the custard may be beaten vigorously to 
redistribute the particles of egg and milk solids. 

Precautions For Custards Made With Acids — ^If a soft 
custard mixture is to be made with vinegar or acid juices, such 
as lemon-juice or tomato-juice, the custard should be removed 
from the heat the minute the mixture begins to thicken. 
Hot acid coagulates egg and then very soon begins to digest it. 
This process makes it thin instead of thick. If an acid custard 
mixture has become thinned by cooking it for a minute too 
long, it must be thickened by adding more egg or by thicken- 
ing it with flour, following the directions for starchy sauces. 
Custards made with acid require more egg than other custards 
to secure the same degree of thickness. 

DIRECTIONS FOR MIXING AND COOKING CUSTARDS 

Scald the liquid. This saves time in making all custards. 

Thoroughly mix eggs, seasoning (as salt)j and flavoring (as 
sugar) by stirring but not by beating. 

Gradually add hot liquid to egg mixture. 

For Firm Custards, pour custard mixture into baking-dish, 
set baking-dish in pan of hot water and cook in slow oven 
(300°-350° F.) or in a steamer at 180° to 200° F. until firm, 
keeping water in pan constantly below the boiling-point. The 
custard is done when the blade of a knife run into the center 
of the custard comes out clean. 



USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 3I 

For Soft Custards, cook in top of double boiler, keeping 
the water in the lower part constantly at 180° to 200° F. or just 
below the boiling-point. Stir constantly until the mixture 
stops frothing, coats the spoon, and has the thickness of cream. 
Remove at once. 

Always cook custard mixtures over hot water or sur- 
rounded by hot water. 

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT MILK 

The value of milk in the daily meals is so great that every 
effort should be made to extend its use in cooking. 

Whole Fresh or Pasteurized Milk need hardly be dis- 
cussed since all homemakers are familiar with its use. Vitamin 
D Milk is a new form carrying an inci^eased content of this 
vitamin. It is desirable, however, to describe other forms of 
milk which today play a prominent role in up-to-date kitchens. 

Evaporated Milk is the most important of these. It is whole 
milk concentrated to double richness by evaporating part of the 
natural water content. No sugar is added. Evaporated milk has 
all the nutritive value of whole milk. When irradiated it carries 
an increased content of Vitamin D. It is an especially suitable 
food for babies. 

For cooking, where whole milk is called for, an equal amount 
of water should be added to evaporated milk. In place of cream, 
it is used undiluted. Because this milk is homogenized, reducing 
the butterfat globules to tiniest particles, it produces excellent 
results in making cream soups, sauces, and other dishes where a 
fine, smooth consistency is desired. 

Dry Milk made by evaporating all water leaves the milk 
solids in powdered form with the food value of pasteurized milk. 

Condensed Milk, which contains a large amount of added 
sugar, is used for making some desserts. 

Skim Milk may be used in cooking, but the fact must be 
remembered that the fat removed has carried with it important 
vitamins which must be returned as butter and cream. 

Buttermilk, produced when the fat is removed as butter, is 
similarly deficient although valuable for its lactic acid. 

Sour Milk is often needed for the invalid, for cooking or 
baking. It can be made from fresh milk by the addition of 2 



tablespoons white vinegar or lemon juice to each pint of milk. 
Allow to stand in a fairly warm place at room temperature for 
one-half hour, then return to refrigerator. The same propor- 
tions obtain for evaporated or irradiated evaporated milk after 
it has been diluted one -half according to directions. In baking, 
use one-half teaspoon soda for every cup of sour milk or cream. 
For Sour Cream add one tablespoon white vinegar or 
lemon juice to one cup cream or each cup evaporated or irradi- 
ated evaporated milk as it comes from the can. 



TO PASTEURIZE MILK 

If there is any question about the cleanliness of fresh milk 
to be used for drinking, it should be pasteurized or boiled. 
Infants or small children should never be fed any milk about 
which there is the slightest doubt. 

Flash Process — ^Put it into a covered co'ntainer set over hot 
water. Heat until the milk reaches a temperature of 160° to 
165° F. Hold at this temperature for one-half to one minute. 
Cool as quickly as possible and keep in a cold place. 

Holding Process — Heat until milk reaches 140° to 150° F. 
Hold at this temperature for about 30 minutes. 

Pasteurized milk, if kept too long, is apt to putrefy instead 
of becoming sour. If any pasteurized milk is left over and 
there is danger of its spoiling before it can be used, it may be 
mixed with a little sour milk and set in a warm place until 
it all becomes sour. Sour milk may be kept for some days. 



TO BOIL MILK 

Flash Method — Put it into a shallow pan and cook quickly 
over direct heat so that the milk is brought as rapidly as possible 
to the boiling-point. Stir constantly to prevent scorching, 
making the figure eight with the spoon, as this brings the spoon 
the greatest number of times in contact with the part of the 
kettle receiving the most heat. 

When the milk has boiled up once, remove from the fire 
and cool as rapidly as possible.

USEFUL FACTS ABOUT FOOD 33 

Milk boiled by this rapid method is believed to be less affected 
in nutritive value than pasteurized milk. 

Boiled milk, like pasteurized milk, spoils rather than sours. 

TO WHIP CREAM 

To whip easily cream must be thick. This requires that it 
must contain not less than 20 per cent butter fat. Best results 
are obtained when it contains 25 to 40 per cent butter fat. 

Fresh cream does not whip well even when it contains more 
than 20 per cent butter fat. This is because lactic acid is 
produced as cream ages, and the acid thickens the cream. The 
addition of one-half teaspoon commercial lactic acid to each 
pint of cream will do the same thing that is accomplished by 
twelve to twenty-four hours standing. 

Warm cream will not whip well because warmth thins cream. 
As cream is chilled, the fat congeals and the cream thickens. 
Cream set on the ice for two hours will whip easily, if it is rich 
enough and old enough. The best temperature for whipping 
cream is between 3 5° and 50° Fahrenheit. Cream is doubled in 
bulk after whipping. 

TO WHIP EVAPORATED MILK 

Milk, bowl and beater should be thoroughly chilled to about 
40° F. If the milk fails to whip, it is not cold enough. Scalding 
the milk prior to chilling causes it to whip a little more 
readily and somewhat stiffer, but scalding is not absolutely 
necessary. To scald the milk, cover the unopened cans with 
cold water. Bring water to a boil and continue boiling for £.ye 
minutes. 

Lemon juice can be added for even greater and "permanent" 
stiffness, when the lemon flavor is suitable to the food with which 
the whipped milk is to be combined. When lemon juice is used, 
first whip the milk until stiff. Then add two tablespoons of 
lemon juice for every cup of milk. Continue whipping long 
enough to blend in the lemon juice. 

Evaporated milk has only about one -fifth of the amount of 
fat contained in whipping cream. Instead, it has a much greater 
content of whole milk solids. For that reason it is an ideal 
ingredient for a dessert which completes an already rich meal.

A KiTCHEN COLLECTION TO GLADDEN THE HEART OF THE MOST ARDENT GADGETEER 



l%# 



mm 



HOW TO BUY FOOD 



THOUGHT should be given to the expenditure of the money 
allotted to food, as a balanced diet, so necessary to health, 
depends on the wise apportionment of that allowance. The fol- 
lowing rules apply to the average healthy family; they may be 
modified by each housewife to meet her own special needs. 

Milk 

Spend as much for milk as is necessary to secure for each child 
three-quarters of a quart to a quart of milk a day and for every- 
one else in the family from one-third to one-half quart of 
milk a day. If you can not afford whole milk, buy skim milk 
for the children. Cheese may replace a part of the milk for 
adults if they prefer it. Two ounces of cheese may be substi- 
tuted for about one-third of a quart of milk. 

Fruits and Vegetables 

It is desirable to include fruit twice a day. Use fresh fruits 
in the height of their season. When they are cheapest, preserve 
them for winter use. Dried fruits, such as prunes, apricots, 
peaches and raisins, can always be bought in the markets and 
are probably the most inexpensive of all fruits. Oranges are 
particularly wholesome and should be used as often as possible 
unless replaced by tomatoes. 

Women and little children will eat about two average potatoes 
and ^ lb. other vegetables daily. Adolescents and men at hard 
work can eat two to three times that amount. 

Cereals 

Buy cereals in variety. Be sure to include a generous pro- 
portion of cereals made from the whole grain. These contain 
elements of nutrition that are lost when the outer coat is 
removed, and also furnish part of the necessary roughage in the 
diet. Such cereals are especially desirable when it is difficult to 
use as great a quantity of vegetables and fruits as these rules call 
for. 

35 



36 



Fat 



For each grown person, every day, buy at least one and one- 
half ounces of fat (butter, cooking fat, cream, fat from meat, 
etc.). For children buy at least one-half as much, unless the 
chMd is getting a quart of whole milk daily; in that case^ he is 
getting a large part of his fat allowance in the milk. 

Meat and Other Protein Food 

Ordinarily, do not try to serve flesh foods (meat, fish, and 
poultry) more than once a day. Milk, eggs, and cheese supply 
a desirable quality of protein or muscle-building foods and 
may be served instead of meat. The more milk one has, the 
less meat he needs. Peas, beans and cereals can not replace the 
high-quality protein found in meat, eggs, milk and cheese, but 
they have great value in supplementing the animal proteins. If 
they are used instead of meat, some milk, eggs or cheese should 
be included in the meal. The weekly allowance of meat foods 
need not be higher than one and three-quarters pounds for each 
person in the family, in order to furnish appetizing meals. This 
means an average daily portion of not more than a quarter of a 
pound. 

A child under four or five years of age is well off without 
any meat at all. If he has an egg every day in addition to his 
three-fourths of a quart or quart of milk allowance, he will get 
adequate protein food. 

A child four or five years old may have a little meat-food 
in addition to his milk allowance. He should have no more 
than a small serving (an ounce or less) each day of lean beef^ 
mutton, lamb, chicken, lean fish or oysters. 

Sweets 

Buy only moderate amounts of sugar, molasses, honey or 
sirup. 

How to Select Canned and Package Goods 

If the average household is to be supplied with the vegetables 
and fruits needed in the abundance recommended in this book, 
some provision must be made to have a supply on hand during 
the months when fresh products are not available. In some 



HOW TO BUY FOOD 37 

households, these will be stored, canned, or otherwise preserved 
at home. In others, they must be purchased fresh from the 
market or bought in preserved form from the dealer. 

It would be a profitable thing for every housewife to learn 
sizes in canned gpods and demartd certain standards. She should 
keep a record of good and poor grades so that she may ask for 
the quality she prefers. Canned goods that are used frequently 
should be purchased in case lots, as a wholesale or reduced price 
can be obtained in that way. 

The canneries have the sizes of cans well standardized and the 
housewife will find it to her advantage to know the common 
sizes. The following list gives the size of the can by numbei 
together with an approximate estimate of its contents: 

Standard Sizes in Cans and What They Contain 

No. y^. cans — ^sardines, potted meats such as deviled ham, 
condensed milk — contain 4 to 4 J/2 oz.; approximately Yz cup. 

No. Yz cans — ^shrimp, lobster, salmon, pimiento, condensed 
milk — contain 754 to 8 oz.; approximately 1 cup. 

No. 1 cans (short or small)— tunafish, canned soup, milk, 
boned meats such as chicken — contain 10 to 13 oz.; approxi- 
mately 154 cups. 

No. 1 cans (tall or square) — salmon, asparagus tips — contain 
1 lb.; approximately 2 cups. 

No. 2 cans — vegetables such as peas, corn, beans and some 
fruits, such as pineapple and berries — contain 1 lb. 4 oz.; 
approximately 2{/2 to 3 cups. 

No. 2 Yz cans — fruits such as pineapple, peaches, pears, plums, 
berries; also many vegetables, such as beets, asparagus stalks in 
square tins, spinach — contain 1 lb. 14 oz. to 1 lb. 15 oz.; 
approximately 3 54 cups. 

No. 3 cans — tomatoes, beets, sauerkraut, pumpkin and fruits 
— contain 2 lbs. to 2 lbs. 1 oz. ; approximately 4 cups. 

No. 10 cans — mince-meat, apple sauce, marmalades, jamsj^ 
pickles, sauerkraut, baked beans, corn on cob, in fact, nearly 
all canned goods for large quantity use — contain 6 lbs. 8 oz. to 
7 lbs. and over for fruits and vegetables and 7 lbs. 8 oz. to 8 
lbs. 12 oz. for marmalades and jams. Approximately 3^ 
quarts. 

While the size of can is standardized, there is a variation in 
weights of cans put up by different canneries. This difference 



38 

in weight is probably due to a more solid pack or a greater 
density in sirup content in the heavier cans and, this being the 
case, the housewife should know not only the number but also 
the weight she can expect in a can of any given size.

' I ^ODAY the modern woman carefully plans her meals. She 
-*• realizes that meals must appeal to the appetite and to the 
eye, but what is more important, they must be properly bal- 
anced to build healthy bodies, to stimulate vigor and energy, 
and to build up resistance against the elements and disease. The 
modern woman, in preparing a food budget, knows that bulky 
foods are essential, but not any more or less than the powerful, 
natural chemicals which we know today as vitamins. The 
modern woman has learned to distinguish between vitamins and 
calories. She knows that vitamins have to do with the chemical 
properties of many kinds of food, supplying the resistance- 
building and life-giving properties we shall discuss shortly at 
greater length. Calories, on the other hand, are units of heat 
formed during digestion of many foods and varying in a re- 
markable degree with the kinds of food eaten. Fresh vegetables 
and fruits provide little heat when digested and hence are said 
to be "low in calories," while fats, starches and sugars produce a 
high degree of heat and so are called "high calorie foods." When 
more of these are eaten than can be used up as energy, the 
remainder is deposited as fat. That is why we gain weight by 
eating foods of high caloric content and lose when their amount 
is reduced. 

WHAT TO BUY TO BUILD HEALTHFUL MENUS 

The food dollar will be used to advantage and serve all its 
necessary purposes, if it is divided into five, spent and served as 
follows: 

One-Fifth or more for whole milk, cream, cheese and cod-liver oil for growing 
children. Plan to give each child 1 quart and each adult at least 1 pint of 
milk in some form, per day. 

One-Fifth for vegetables and fruit, with emphasis on the green leaf and yellow 
fruits and vegetables. Serve at least 1 cooked vegetable, besides potatoes, 
and 1 fresh vegetable each day. Serve fresh fruit twice a day, with citrus 
fruit at least once. 

One-Fifth or less for meats, fish and eggs, serving liver in some form at least 
once a week. 

One-Fifth for breads and cereals, especially the whole grains. 

One-Fifth for fats, sugar and other groceries.

WHAT FOOD MATERIALS DO FOR THE BODY 

The healthy body is built and maintained by: 
Protein — whelps make flesh and blood 
Calcium — for bone, teeth, glands, nerve and muscle 
Phosphorus — for bones, teeth, glands, muscle and nerve 
Iron — with Copper and Manganese to help make blood 
Iodine — for the funaioning of the thyroid gland 
Fat — heat, energy and padding for nerve and muscle 
Sugars and Starches; — supply heat and energy as well as fat — necessary for 
the proper functioning of the liver and the digestion of fat 

Health can not be maintained nor the body function properly 
without abundant supplies of Vitamins. They are: 
Vitamin A — ^promotes growth, increases resistance to infeaive 

diseases and prevents certain eye diseases 
Vitamin B — ^promotes growth, stimulates appetite, protects nerve 

and brain tissue and function 
Vitamin C — ^promotes growth, protects jawbone and teeth and the 

walls of the blood vessels 
Vitamin D — ^promotes calcification of teeth and bones, hence 

protects against rickets and its deformities 
Vitamin E — ^proteas the growth and funaion of the reproduaive 

glands and organs 
Vitamin F — ^promotes growth and protects skin, hair and kidneys 
Vitamin G — ^promotes growth and normal nutrition and prevents pellagra

MENU MAKING 



ALTHOUGH it is desirable that each meal should be well 
selected, the food for the entire day is the real measure of 
good nutrition. The food -selection chart should be used to de- 
termine the types of food to be selected. The art of combining 
these foods into wholesome and satisfying meals is the art of 
menu making. 

Every meal should be planned to meet first the needs of the 
youngest and weakest member of the family. Foods that are 
good for children are equally good for adults but foods that 
are good for adults may be very bad for children. It is easier 
to suit a child's dietary to the adult than to suit an adult's 
dietary to a child. 

Points to Keep in Mind in Making Menus 

In order to encourage good digestion and to make sure that 
the family enjoys the meal as well as receives benefit from it, 
all of the following factors should be considered: 

The Staying Quality of Food— Does it leave the stomach 
quickly or slowly? For healthy, active adults working out- 
doors, a great deal of food that has considerable staying quality 
may be highly desirable. For indoor workers and for children 
this type of food may be the wrong choice. 

Fats and fat-rich foods all have staying quality. Cream 
sauces, cereals and similar foods have moderate staying qualities. 
Liquid foods, foods containing meat-juices or fruit acids are 
likely to encourage quick passage of food along the digestive 
tract. This is one reason for beginning a meal with meat soup 
or fruit in some form. 

The Most Satisfactory Conditions of digestion and elimi- 
nation are encouraged by use of generous amounts of bulky, 
moist foods, such as fruits, succulent vegetables, whole cereals 
and water. 

Too Much Sweet Food should not be included, since it may 
give rise to excessive fermentation in the digestive tract. 

Too Much Meat and Eggs should not be included, since 

47 



tliey may give rise to excessive putrefaction in the digestive 
tract. 

The Texture of Food plays an important part in its attrac- 
tiveness. Crisp foods should be associated with soft ones. 
Variations in texture, even in a single dish, always appeal: oat- 
meal with cream and a sprinkle of coarse sugar; rice pudding 
with raisins; ice-cream with cake; crackers with cheese; crisp 
salad with soft dressing. 

The Appearance of Food is important to civilized man. 
Beautiful color and dainty, attractive arrangement play a large 
part in a successful meal. 

The Flavor of Food plays an important part. Too often, 
however, food is selected only on the basis of what tastes good. 
The main background of the diet should be made up of bland, 
mild-flavored foods, like milk, bread, cereals, many vegetables. 
The accent should come by the use of the more highly flavored 
foods such as meat, fruit, sugar, condiments and herbs of 
various kinds. 

Suggestions for the General Plan of a Day's Meals 

Breakfast 

Fruit, fresh, canned, dried, or fresh stewed. 

Milk, or cocoa made with milk, for the children. Milk^ 
cocoa, tea, coflFee or other beverage for adults. Milk on cereal 
for all the family. 

Cereal, preferably whole, for all the family. 

Bread, toast or muffins with butter. 

If a heartier meal is needed, it may be desirable to add eggs, 
bacon or other fat meat, and potatoes, adapting the method of 
cooking to the children. 

Doughnuts, cookies, jam, jelly, marmalade, and pancakes 
with sirup should be considered desserts, even at breakfast time,} 
to be eaten only after more wholesome foods have been taken. 

Lunch or Supper 

An egg, cheese or milk dish. 

Succulent vegetable or salad. 

Bread and butter, toast, muffins, or plain sandwiches. 

Milk for children. Any preferred beverage for adults. 



IvlENU MAKING 49 

Sweets in moderation. Only light desserts such as fruit, 
simple pudding, and cookies should be served at supper. 

The meal may be made more elaborate, if desired, but should 
always partake of simplicity. 

Dinner 

Meat or other flesh or an egg or cheese dish. Dried beans 
may be used if milk or eggs are provided in the meal. 

Potatoes, unless the meal includes dried beans, macaroni or 
rice. 

Another vegetable. Two vegetables (not potatoes) should 
be used with dried beans, macaroni or rice. 

Bread and butter. 

Salad may be served in addition to the meal or in the place 
of dessert. Raw vegetables that may be served as salad are 
particularly desirable. 

Sweets in moderation. 

If all the milk that a person requires has not been used, the 
remaining amount may be served as a beverage. 

If a more elaborate dinner is desired, the meal may begin 
with soup or an appetizer, such as a fruit cocktail or grapefruit^ 
oysters in some form, or a canape. The problem of the formal 
meal is discussed in the section that follows the simple menus 
given below.

The Problem of the Formal Meal 

The purpose of food is to satisfy hunger and to give pleasure. 
After hunger is satisfied, more food is a hindrance to health. 
After the appetite has been stimulated by a variety of foods, to 
stimulate it further jades it. 

At one time it was the custom to serve long and elaborate 
dinners having many courses and much repetition of type foods. 
Gradually the realization has grown that elaborate meals are 
not justified from any point of view, social, physiological or 
economic, and that even the most formal meal must follow the 
rules of health. 

Formal meals which conform to laws of health and good taste 
may be arranged according to the following general plan: 



First Course 

The Appetizer — Any one of the following types of dishes, 
with proper accompaniments, serves to whet the appetite: 

Canapes or tiny open sandwiches made with highly flavored 
mixtures. Raw oysters or clams; oyster or clam cocktails. 
Grapefruit or fruit cocktail; avocado served with lemon- juice; 
cantaloup, watermelon or similar fruit. Soup, preferably a 
clear stock soup. 

Second Course 

To Satisfy the Appetite — ^For dinners, the piece de resis- 
tance, or main course, may be any one of the following — roasts 
of meat, poultry, baked fish or game, with the proper accom- 
paniments of vegetables and a starchy food such as rice or 
macaroni. 

For luncheons, the main course may be any one of the fol- 
lowing — a small steak, chops, made dishes or entrees of meat, 
fish, poultry, game, eggs, or cheese, served with a succulent 
vegetable, preferably a green vegetable, and rolls. 

Third Course 

Light, Refreshing and Crisp — The salad course may be 
any simple vegetable salad with a suitable accompaniment of 



MENU MAKING 55 

dressing and breadstuff. Meat salads or heavy mixed or com- 
plicated salads should not be served in this type of meal. 

Fourth Course 

The Sweet or Bonne Bouche — ^This course may consist of 
any frozen dessert, sponge, whip, meringue with fruit, or any 
individual tart or pastry. 

Fifth Course 

To Keep the Sweet from Being Too Well Remembered 
— ^This course includes a demi-tasse of coffee, with sugar, and 
cream if desired. It may include fruit or crackers and a cheese 
with high flavor. 



If the person giving a formal dinner or lunch has not been 
converted to the new idea of simplicity and desires a more 
elaborate meal than the type just outlined, more courses may be 
introduced. An entree may come between the appetizer and 
the main course. Soup may follow fruit or raw oysters. Fish, 
may be served as a separate course, with meat to follow. An 
entree may be introduced between the fish and meat courses. 
All of these procedures are correct by custom. 

Order of Courses 

The courses in a meal are served in the following order: 

1. Appetizer 6. Salad 

2. Soup 7. Dessert 

3. Fish 8. Crackers and Cheese with Coffee 

4. Roast 9. Nuts and Raisins 

5. Game 10. Fruit 

For the place of the entree, see chapter. Entrees and Made- 
Over Dishes.

THE SCHOOL LUNCH 



AS much care is needed in selecting and preparing the food 
for the child's lunch at school as for the other meals 
served to the child. If the lunch is inadequate or lacking in 
food essentials throughout the school year, the child's whole 
nutrition will be seriously affected, and his work at school will 
suffer. The school lunch is one of three meals, not just a 
"snack," and should possess the following characteristics: 

1. It should be abundant in amount for a hungry, healthy 
child. A little too much is better than too little. 

2. It should be chosen with regard to the nutritive needs of 
the child and in relation to the whole day's food. 

3. It should be clean, appetizing, wholesome and attractive. 



FOOD SELECTION CHART FOR CHILDREN 

Select from the following chart and make the school lunch 
bear its full share of responsibility for carrying the foods the 
child needs. 

Milk — ^ to 1 quart daily. 

Vegetables — ^Two servings daily (in addition to potatoes). 
Fruit — Two servings daily (fresh, canned or dried), one of fresh 

fruit or fresh or canned tomatoes if possible. 
Cereals — ^Whole cereal bread, usually. Whole cereal breakfast food, 

usually. 
Water — 1 Yz quarts liquid daily (may be included in other foods) . 



How to Use the Selected Foods 

Foods selected from the above groups may be included in 
the school lunch in the following forms: 

Sandwiches — ^Made as often as possible from whole cereal 
breads^ as graham^ whole wheat, oatmeal. Made to include 
some substantial food which will increase the value of the meal. 
Supplied in sufficient number to satisfy hunger. Made care- 
fully and well. 

Succulent Foods — ^Whole orange, whole tomato, whole 
apples, apple sauce^ peaches (whole or sliced) 2 celery, stewed 

60 



THE SCHOOL LUNCH 6i 

fruit, prunes, baked apple, sliced fruit, dates, berries. Fruits 
and vegetables are especially important in the dietary of the 
growing child and pains must be taken always to include ade- 
quate amounts of them. They are not always easy to include 
in the school lunch, yet if the child is to be well nourished, 
some way must be devised to get them in. 

Milk Always — ^This should never be omitted. It may be 
carried in a special container provided for the purpose or it 
may be included in the hot dish. 

One Hot Dish if Possible — The value of hot food in the 
lunch is now so generally recognized that many country and 
town schools have made provision for serving at least one hot 
dish at the noon hour. If not available at school, hot food may 
be carried in the lunch box. A vacuum container will solve 
the problem satisfactorily.

Preparation of Food 

Sandwiches — Since sandwiches form a main part of the 
school lunch, their preparation is most important. 

Wholesome breads should be used for sandwiches. Graham, 
whole wheat, oatmeal, brown, raisin, and nut bread are ex- 
cellent. Cold bran or whole wheat muffins or filled rolls are 
often tempting. 

Fillings for the sandwiches for the school lunch require some 
special preparation. The filling should be abundant in amount 
and should play an important part in the sandwich. 

Cheese, meat, eggs, nuts, dried fruits or vegetables should be 
put through the food-chopper. Cream cheese, peanut butter 
and other compact substances should be thinned with cream. 
Ground meats, eggs, and vegetables should be moistened with 
a small amount of salad dressing or cream and vinegar. Suc- 
culent vegetables should be provided, if possible. Finely 
chopped celery, lettuce, water cress or sliced tomato may be 
used alone or with cottage cheese. Finely cut pineapple or 
orange may be used in sandwiches. 

Jellies, jams and conserves make sweet sandwiches or a tiny 
jar of the fruited sweet may be tucked into the lunch box. 

Dried figs, dates, raisins, thoroughly washed and steamed in 2 
small sieve or strainer over boiling water for thirty minutes and 
then ground and moistened with a small amount of fruit- juice 
or salad dressing, make excellent sandwiches. 

Pickles, chow-chow and relishes should take a subordinate 
place in the school lunch box. 

The chapter on Sandwiches (See Index) , gives full directions 
and recipes for a variety of sandwiches. 

Hot Dishes — Special vacuum containers make it possible to 
send hot cocoa or hot soup with the lunch, also a creamed 
vegetable, a hot pudding or other hot food. These containers 
should never be filled the night before the lunch is prepared. 
If foods prepared for dinner are to be used for the school 
lunch, these foods should be kept in a cool place, uncovered, 
over night and reheated in the morning. 

Milk — ^If there is any possibility that the milk will not keep 
sweet for three hours, it may be put while cold into the vacuum 
container. Good milk properly kept should be in good con- 
dition if carried in a milk bottle or small glass fruit- jar. 



THE SCHOOL LUNCH 63 

Liquid and Semi-Solid Foods — Stewed prunes and canned 
fruits niay be carried in any small screw-top container. A cold 
rice pudding or other pudding, custards or similar desserts may 
also be carried in this manner. 

Packing the Lunch 

All foods not in containers should be wrapped separately in 
waxed paper before being placed in the box. The neatly 
wrapped articles should be placed, so far as is possible, in the 
order in which the food will be eaten, so that those found first 
may be eaten first without disturbing the remainder. The 
heaviest foods, however, should be placed at the bottom. 

Articles should be packed compactly in order to prevent the 
food from shaking about. Empty space may be filled neatly 
with paper. When space seems lacking, the difficulty may be 
overcome by more careful packing, by resorting to such ex- 
pedients as cutting fruits or cookies in half^ or by packing sand- 
wiches the other way of the box. 

The Lunch Box 

Select a box that can be kept clean. Lunch boxes should 
be washed, scalded and aired daily. Those made of light- 
weight metal are best. Many attractive boxes are now made 
with a vacuum bottle which fits the box. These are highly 
desirable. A lunch box should not be air-tight, as a circulation 
of air prevents the mingling of odors. All food should be pro- 
tected from dirt by wrapping. 

Accessories — ^A small vacuum container of cup-like shape 
for hot foods, a screw-top container for liquid or semi-solid 
food, plenty of waxed paper, and paper napkins are essential 
lunch box accessories. 

"Without the Hot Dish — In many places the school, the 
Parent-Teacher Association or some woman's club provides milk 
and/or prepares one hot dish at school to be sold to children 
for a few cents. In this case the lunch box need contain only 
the sandwiches, vegetables and fruit. The greatest care should 
be exercised that vitamins and minerals are not sacrificed to 
bulk. Carrot sticks, parsley, whole tomatoes, radishes, cabbage 
leaves, oranges or grapefruit will take care of this. 



TABLE SETTING AND 
SERVICE 



THE social life of a household, whether the household is a 
simple one or an elaborate one, centers about its dining- 
table and whether that dining-table is simply or elaborately- 
dressed, it should, by its harmony and unity of setting, indicate 
that it is arranged according to a definite artistic standard. 
Every accessory that builds the table-picture — the silver, china, 
glass, and linen — furthers the art of gracious living in the house- 
hold. 

CHINA 

Perhaps in greater degree than any other domestic appoint- 
ments, does china present an opportunity for indulgence of per- 
sonal whim and the exercise of good taste on the part of the hos- 
tess. Today there are patterns for every occasion. Breakfast 
china is gay, sprightly; color runs rampant upon it; often whole 
gardens shine on its face. But it would not be used for a 
dinner, which demands fine china of exquisitely fine design. 
Luncheon is still another thing. Its china may vary as the 
season — or as the whim of the hostess. 

Modern day impatience with formula and rite is nowhere 
more eloquently expressed than in the growing custom of using 
different patterns for different courses, all related by the thread 
of harmony. The hostess of today considers sameness identical 
with boredom. If she uses a cobalt and gold service plate, she 
may elect to use a simple gold-banded entree plate. The fish 
plate perhaps may have yellow bands to match the flowers in 
the center. The roast plate may present a pattern border, 
touched with gold, and yellow, and blue. Her dessert plate will 
be utterly different from any of the foregoing: it may strike 
an entirely new note; but it will not be discordant or jarring. 
Obviously, all dishes used in one course should match. 

Plates of Various Sizes and How They Are Used 

In the following list the measurements, in inches, are from 
extreme rim to rim. 

64 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 65 

Place Plate (also called cover plate, service plate, lay plate) . 
10 to 11 inches. 

Dinner Plate (roast plate). 10 inches, but seen as large 
as 1 J4 inches. The size of the dinner plate is fairly large, due 
to the current practice of placing attendant vegetables on the 
plate with the meat. The day of side dishes, each bearing a 
particular variety of vegetables, has definitely passed. 

Entree Plate. SYz to 9 Yz inches. A most convenient size, 
for, in addition to its use in serving entrees, it is often employed 
as a salad plate, or a fish plate: even a dessert plate when the 
finger bowl is borne in with the dessert silver on the plate, the 
finger bowl being removed later. 

Dessert Plate. Zj/z to 8 inches. Used for miscellaneous 
desserts, and salads. It becomes the cake plate at tea. 

Bread and Butter Plate. 6 to 6^ inches. Universally 
used now: the butter chip, for individual butter service is 
extinct. 

Soup Plate. 8 to 8 ^ inches at rim, for the usual type o£ 
soup plate with wide, flat rim. There is also a bowl soup plate^ 
or "coup*' soup, which has no rim at all. Soup plates are not 
as commonly used as at one time, due to the spreading favor 
accorded the cream soup cup and the bouillon cup for luncheons 
and informal meals. 

Cups and Bowls 

Cream Soup Cup. This is a low, broad cup, handled on 
both sides. Its width is from 4Y2 to 5 inches, and its depth 
about two. It is tised for the serving of purees, bisques, cream 
soups, and is extremely popular for luncheons. 

Bouillon Cup. A tea cup with two handles. Clear soups, 
consommes, bouillons are served in it. 

Chilled Cocktail Bowl. This is distinctly an innovation 
in china service. It is a low, wide bowl, fitted with a separate 
small container. The space between the bowl proper and the 
inner cup is filled with crushed ice. Used for grapefruit, 
shrimp cocktail, and many other foods best served chilled. 

GLASS 

Of late years, an awakening appreciation of the charm of 
glass has taken place. Perhaps the appeal of glorious color. 



66 

so striking in this substance, accounts for it. Blue in varying 
tones was some years ago in wide favor; then amethyst dis- 
placed it. Rapidly came amber, and green, which maintain a 
deserved respect, because of their adaptability. Rose, canary, 
sapphire, in quick succession — no color today is unrepresented. 

Glass is often selected to "go with" certain tones of china. 
The hostess with a sense of fitness has a glass service for each 
of her dinner services. For her severely formal tables she uses 
glittering crystal, etched or cut, engraved or gold decorated. 

But there is ample opportunity for her to indulge her love 
for color to the full, to arrange tables with an eye to the dining- 
room effects^ or to build them according to her own color 
preferences. 

Kinds of Glasses 

Goblet. The goblet is the aristocrat of table glass. In its 
usual form it is a flaring round bowl resting on a tall slender 
stem. In certain styles, however, the "stem" becomes a mere 
button. Goblets are always provided with a foot, however 
small. The goblet is the dominant member of the "place glass" 
group, and all glasses of a service take their shape from it, fol- 
lowing its contours very closely. 

Other Place Glass. In addition to the goblet, there may 
be placed at each cover at least one other glass for the cup or 
other beverages. At very formal dinners two extra glasses are 
often placed, but never more. 

The shapes and sizes of these supplementary glasses vary as 
their purposes. On the continent, for example, there is a 
definite type of glass placed for certain wines. Thus a glass for 
sherry is differently shaped from one for claret: it is more 
sharply tapered and considerably smaller. 

For the most part the glasses of this type that we see in 
America are either the claret, or the tall shallow champagne 
glass. The claret, whose capacity makes it a fine utility glass, 
is used for almost any kind of cup. On the other hand the tall 
champagne glass is often placed for its high decorative value. 
Few glasses are as graceful as this shallow bowl on its slender 
shaft. 

Sherbet. The sherbet glass is a medium depth broad bowl 
on a short stem. In it are served sherbets, ice-cream, frozen 
(desserts. Much used now, however, for this purpose is the tall 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE ^J 

shallow champagne glass, perhaps because of its more imposing 
height and dignity. 

Hollow Stem Champagne. This glass is similar to the tall 
champagne glass, except that the stem instead of being solid 
is hollow to the very bottom. While its primary use was for 
serving champagne, today we often serve in it ginger ale, and 
other carbonated drinks. The hollow stem releasing a train of 
sparkling bubbles is picturesque indeed. 

Finger Bowl. The finger bowl is a low broad bowl^ vari- 
ously shaped. It is usually seen without a "foot," but certain 
styles have such supports. Finger bowls are fitted with match- 
ing under-plates, but their use is optional. 

Grapefruit Bowl. This is a double bowl for chilled food 
cocktails. It consists of a large bowl on a stem. Within it is 
placed a smaller "cup" or "lining." The grapefruit or other 
cocktail is put in the small cup, and the space between the cups 
is filled with crushed ice. 

Tumbler. In its simplest form, a tumbler is simply a glass 
cylinder with one end closed. But the glass designer does 
wonders with it. He mounts it on a foot: he shapes its sides in 
lovely contours: often he makes it angular instead of round. 

The sizes commonly used are: 

Apollinaris Tumbler, This is a small, narrow tumbler used 
for liquids that are served in small quantities, such as orange 
juice, grape juice, mineral water. It is often used for water 
when space is at a premium, as on breakfast trays, or at bridge 
tables. It holds about £.Ye ounces. 

Table Tumbler, Also called water tumbler. It is a low 
tumbler, containing about ten ounces, and is used to serve water 
informally, at simple meals. 

There is also a water tumbler of about the same capacity, but 
narrower and taller, sometimes called the "Ale tumbler." 

Highball Tumbler, A tall tumbler, used to serve "long 
drinks," or iced tea, iced coffee, iced chocolate, and so forth. It 
holds about 12 ounces. 

Iced Tea Tutnbler, A normal iced tea tumbler, sufficiently 
large to contain plenty of ice. Its capacity runs from 14 to 16 
ounces. 

Besides the Pieces in General Use Described AbovEj; 
there are all manner of articles blown for special uses: trays for 
hors d'oeuvres; salad bowls, salt dips, saucers for berries, and 
plates of various sizes.

SILVER 

The silver on your table is a declaration of your taste. 
Whether it is sterling or plate, there is, in an excellent pattern 
and in the perfect form and proportion of the utensils, an 
unmistakable aristocracy that gives distinction. 

Modern methods of manufacturing silver plate have made 
it not only durable but beautiful as well. Plated silver ranges 
from the very durable triple-plated ware, (heavy weight) which 
lasts a lifetime, through the double plate (medium weight) 
which has good wearing qualities, to the single plate which is 
light weight. 

When you choose a pattern of silver, examine all the pieces^ 
to be sure that you approve of the shapes of all the pieces, 
that the pieces are perfectly balanced, that the handles are 
comfortable to hold, and that the tips of the handles of the 
knives and forks fit perfectly into the center of the palm 
of the hand. Find out how long the pattern has been on the 
market, and, if possible, how long it is to be made, so that you 
will not suddenly discover that the pattern has been "discon- 
tinued." 

Place silver, or flat silver as it is sometimes called, consists of 
the knives, forks, and spoons necessary for general use at table. 

Knives and Forks 

The dinner knife and fork, although imposing members of 
the silver-family, are not the most important members, for 
their use is limited to the main course of dinner. 

The luncheon knife and fork offer the greatest variety of 
uses. They may be used "around the clock," for breakfast, for 
luncheon, for supper, and for certain courses at dinner, such as 
hors d'oeuvres, entree, fish, salad, for dishes served in a rame- 
kin, for dishes served at informal entertaining, and for large 
and small sandwiches. 

Smaller than the luncheon knife and fork are the tea knife 
and fork, with their increasingly-recognized number of uses. 

Butter spreaders are necessary in your first list. 

Later if you are not content to use the medium size knives 
and forks or the tea knives and forks for special courses like 
fishj entree, salad, and fruit, you may buy fish knives and forksj 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE

entree knives and forks, and salad knives and forks (or, if you 
prefer, individual salad forks,) and fruit knives, or preferably, 
fruit knives and forks. 

Spoons 

Accompanying the medium size knife and forkj and of a 
size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, is the dessert spoon, 
the spoon of a variety of uses, from eating soup and cereals, 
to eating desserts such as pudding and compote of fruit. 

Teaspoons have a great variety of uses, and while these are 
the first kind of small spoon to be bought you will want 
to add when you can, orange spoons, bouillon spoons, ice-cream 
spoons, coflfee spoons, £vq o'clock teaspoons, and iced tea spoons.

LINEN 

White linen damask is the classic covering for the dinner- 
table. Linen and lace are often combined and sometimes 



70 

elaborate all-lace table-cloths are used. When a lace cloth is 
used, it is placed on a bare table. 

In the colored damasks every woman will find an opportunity 
to vary her table setting effects occasionally with a harmonious 
combination of pastel shades in table-cloth and glass and china 
and flower-centerpiece. But the conservative woman still vises 
white damask for her formal dinners, and undoubtedly will 
continue to do so. 

Table-cloths 

Before you buy your table-cloths, carefully measure your 
table, and allow a twelve- to fifteen-inch hangover for your 
dinner cloths, and an eight- to twelve-inch hangover for your 
luncheon cloths. 

Table-cloths should be French-hemmed, with the hem three- 
eighths of an inch to one-half an inch wide, and napkins, also 
French-hemmed, have hems of from one-eighth of an inch to 
one-quarter of an inch wide. 

A white linen damask cloth is as appropriate to the formal 
or informal luncheon as to the formal or informal dinner. Gay 
colored sets of damask or of less formal materials are often 
used. Linen runners, with small luncheon napkins to match^ 
are popular, especially on long tables like refectory tables. An 
especially beautiful table is sometimes left bare except for the 
lace rounds under the centerpiece, plates^ and glasses. Damask 
napkins are used with these. 

Luncheon sets are appropriate for use at breakfast, luncheong 
an informal dinner on the porch, or an informal supper. 

For the tea table one may use an embroidered or hemstitched 
teacloth, or a simple or elaborate lace cover^ or a combination 
of linen and lace. 

Napkins 

Table-cloths and napkins should match. For formal dinners 
an unusually large napkin is smart, but nowadays napkins, like 
most other "furnishings," have shrunk, and one rarely en- 
counters dinner napkins larger than twenty-eight inches and 
usually not larger than twenty- four inches. 

Luncheon napkins are from thirteen inches to eighteen inches 
square. White hemstitched luncheon napkins are often used 
with a white linen damask cloth. 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 7% 

Breakfast napkins, often colored or with a colored border to 
match the cloth, are usually a bit smaller than luncheon napkins 
but may be the same size. 

Appropriate to the appointments of the tea table are the 
small tea napkins, sometimes of fine handkerchief linen with 
scalloped edges, sometimes of damask with hemstitched borders, 
and sometimes of heavy linen with drawnwork borders. In 
houses with Early American furnishings — and with excellent 
laundry technic — the old-fashioned damask napkins with 
fringe edges add a charmingly quaint touch. But with uncer- 
tain laundering these are very apt to be unattractive looking. 

Monogramming 

The pattern or design of the cloth and napkins and the type, 
design, and size of the monograms embroidered on them should 
make a perfect unity. 

For table-cloths, the size of the monogram should be from 
two and one-half to five inches. For dinner napkins from one 
to two inches. For luncheon and breakfast napkins and doilies, 
from three-quarters of an inch to an inch and a half. 

When the bride-to-be is marking her trousseau linens, it is 
best form for her to use the initials of her maiden name. How- 
ever, there is no hard and fast rule for this marking, and she 
may if she prefers use the initials of the first and last names of 
her maiden name and the initial letter of the groom's last name. 

If an initial is used instead of a monogram it should be the 
initial of your last name. When only one letter is used, it is 
usually a block letter — sometimes ornate — ^since a single letter 
in script is not very effective-looking. 

How to Measure for the Placing of the Monogram 

Spread the cloth on the table, place the end of your measur- 
ing stick at the corner of the table, and point it in the direction 
of the corner diagonally opposite. Measure from twelve to 
fifteen inches, mark this oflf, and place your monogram there 
unless it will, in this place, interfere with the design in the 
damask. In that event, raise it or lower it to make it artistically 
well-placed. 

On a table-cloth of two yards square or less usually only 



72 

one monogram is placed. Larger sizes usually have two mono- 
grams diagonally opposite each other. 

Dinner napkins should be marked with a smaller monogram 
of the same design as that used on the table-cloth. They are 
now usually embroidered in what is known as the "center of 
the side." Fold the napkin into thirds, and again into thirds 
in the opposite way. On the top of the center square with the 
selvedge toward you, place the monogram in the approximate 
center. 

Tea napkins may be monogrammed with the two or three 
initials used on the other napkins. In very fine linen ones, cut- 
out monograms are often used. 



TABLE DECORATION 

Have in mind a definite plan. 

Consider carefully the artistic height for your table decora- 
tions: table decorations that are too high are awkward, and 
those that are too low become monotonous to the eye. 

No table decorations should obstruct the view of the guests 
(although at large, formal dinners, when the conversation can- 
not be general anyway, they may be tall). 

All tall decorations should be narrow (e. g. candles). 

Avoid over-decoration and inappropriate decorations. Don't 
crowd your table or make it look heavy. 

Discriminate between a formal party and an informal party, 
and adapt your decorations accordingly. 

Keep in mind the color-scheme of your room, and the colors 
of the food in your menu, and harmonize the color of your 
table decorations with these. 

Adapt your flowers to the type and proportions of your 
flower-container. 

Centerpieces 

Centerpieces are of infinite variety, their beauty and dis- 
tinction being limited only by one's imagination and one's 
budget. Flowers are still — and probably always will be — the 
most lovely decoration for the center of the table. The fashion 
of supporting a few flowers in flower-holders in low silver or 
glass bowls makes possible simple and very effective arrange- 
ments. Unusual effects may be obtained with central mirrors 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 73 

and with mirrored tables, with fruits, with formal combinations 
of flowers and fruits, with crystal trees and flowers, with deli- 
cate figurines, and even with amusing accessories of simple or 
elaborate kinds. But one must be careful that the designs 
built with unusual accessories are beautiful and appropriate 
and not simply bizarre. 

Compote Dishes and Candles 

To balance the centerpiece, decorative silver or glass — or 
gold! — compote dishes, two or four in number, are usually 
placed toward the ends of the table. These dishes, containing 
bonbons or mints or nuts, may be low, medium, or high, accord- 
ing to the proportion required by the other table decorations. 

Four candles, or more if the table is very large, are used in 
candlesticks of glass or silver or fine china, and sometimes of 
pottery for an informal dinner on an Italian or Spanish table. 
Instead of candlesticks handsome silver candelabra may be 
placed on each side of the centerpiece. 

The candles should be lighted before the guests enter the 
dining-room, and allowed to burn until they leave the dining- 
room, even if they stay so long in the dining-room that the 
candles burn down to their sockets! 

The height of the candles should, of course, be adapted to 
the height of the candlesticks — very tall candles in low stand- 
ards, and shorter ones in the standard of average height. Low 
candlesticks with tall slender tapers are interesting and effec- 
tive, but their use is more appropriate to informal occasions. 
Formal functions seem to need the dignity of tall candlesticks. 

Candles for formal dinner tables usually are the color of 
natural wax or, if that is not obtainable, of white. As a matter 
of fact, many hostesses use candles of this color on their tables 
for all their parties. Of course colored candles may be used 
to carry out a decorative scheme, and are festive and appro- 
priate for special occasions. 

Candles are now never shaded. 

Service or ^^Cover" Plate 

A service plate (sometimes called a "place plate" or "lay 
plate," and, most appropriately, a "cover plate"), which is 



74 

about one inch larger than a dinner plate, is used in formal 
service. A service plate is a background plate on which other 
plates are placed. Since its function is largely decorative, it 
should be as handsome as your circumstances permit. Service 
plates are usually of beautiful china, though sometimes they 
are of gold or silver or silver plate or even glass. If they are 
of china, they do not match the rest of the china in design^ 
since they are usually far more ornate. In advance of the 
meal, the service plate is set in the center of each cover, one 
inch, or sometimes two inches, from the edge of the table. No 
food is served directly on the service plate. On it are placed 
the plates containing the first courses of the meal, such as fruity 
oysters, and soup. It is not removed until it is exchanged for 
the plate of the first hot course after the soup. 

Large service plates are not used for breakfast, and it is 
usually inconvenient to use them in homes where there is no 
service, or in homes where the food is served at the table by the 
hostess or host or both. 

Place Cards 

Place cards are used at formal dinners and luncheons for con- 
venience in seating the guests. A place card should be simple 
(plain white ones are best) of about the size of a visiting-card. 
It is sometimes engraved with the hostess' monogram or crest 
embossed in plain white. Sometimes at feature parties, such as 
Hallowe'en or Valentine's Day, decorative place cards are used to 
carry out the motif of the entertainment. The name of the 
guest is written on the card, the title — Mrs., Miss, or Mr. — be- 
fore the name. Place cards are usually placed above the cover 
so that they do not conceal the beauty of either the place plate 
or the napkin. 

Salts and Peppers 

Salts and peppers may be tall, gold or silver ones, or they 
may be low silver or crystal ones, or a silver pepper shaker ac- 
companied by a low salt cup lined with old blue glass. For 
breakfast use, they may be of china or pottery, consistent with 
the informality of the breakfast table or tray. 

It is customary to place a set of salts and peppers between 
every two covers if the party is large, or a pair at each corner 
of the table, if few are dining, or at two corners of a small 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 75 

table. Individual sets are sometimes placed. Whether salt 
shakers or salt cups are used is a matter of choice, but with 
salt cups small salt-spoons should be provided. 

Bread and Butter Plates 

These convenient little plates are used at breakfast and 
luncheon, and at family and other informal dinners. Since 
butter is not served at formal dinners, bread and butter platesj 
are not usually placed. However, there is now a tendency to 
place bread and butter plates on the table, except at the most 
formal dinners, many hostesses maintaining, and quite rightly, 
too, that these plates are of great convenience, in affording a 
harbor for the roll or bread and for the celery, radishes, and 
nuts that are passed at dinner. 

Bread and butter plates are removed after the salad course, 
with the salts and peppers. 



The Napkin 

The napkin is usually placed at the left of the forks and 
parallel with them. If the napkin is folded in a square or other- 
wise folded so that the corners are up, it is placed so that the 
open corners are toward the plate. 

Often one sees the napkin placed on the service plate, but 
unless space demands this, it is not to be recommended. Service 
plates are usually of such loveliness that none of their beauty 
should be sacrificed. 

It is no longer good form to put bread or a dinner roll in the 
napkin — too many embarrassing moments resulted from that 
custom, for it was most natural, when one was engrossed in 
conversation, to take up the napkin unthinkingly and discover 
the roll perversely flying for the regions under the table. 

Finger Bowls 

There are three methods of placing finger bowls: 
First, if the finger bowl is needed after fruits at the begin- 
ning of a meal, or after corn on the cob, artichokes, and other 
food that demands the use of the fingers, it may be placed to 
the left of the cover when the table is laid or it may be brought 



in toward the end of the course and placed to the left of the 
cover. 

Second, if the dessert plate and finger bowl are served to- 
gether, the finger bowl is placed on the dessert plate, usually 
with a small fine white or cream doily between it and the plate, 
and the dessert silver placed on the sides of the plate, the fork on 
the left and the knife or spoon (depending on what the dessert 
may be) on the right. The guest removes the silver, placing 
the spoon or knife to the right, and the fork to the left, of the 
cover. Then he removes the finger bowl and doily and places 
them on the left of the cover, leaving the plate ready to receive 
the fruit or dessert. 

Third, if the dessert is served in individual portions, say 
in a sherbet glass or some other container, which precludes the 
placing of the finger bowl on the dessert plate, the finger bowl, 
on a doily on a plate, is placed in front of the guest after the 
last course. 

If especially beautiful glass or silver finger bowls and plates 
are used, many hostesses now omit the doily between, maintain- 
ing that it destroys the harmony between the bowl and the 
plate. 

The bowls, half-filled with tepid water, may be placed on 
the side table before the meal is announced. 



SETTING THE TABLE 

Precision and decision are demanded in table-setting: mathe- 
matical precision in laying the table-covering and in placing 
the silver and other table-appointments, and artistic decision in 
the choice and harmonious arrangement of the table-appoint- 
ments. 

Spreading the Cloth 

"Wlien the table-covering is the conventional table-cloth, first 
place the silence-cloth, of white, thick, doublefaced material, 
which usually extends five inches over each side of the table. 
This is sometimes tied in place to prevent slipping. 

Over this, spread the table cloth, perfectly laundered. There 
should be in the table cloth only one crease, the straight central 
crease, and the cloth should be most carefully adjusted so that 
this fold is placed exactly in the center of the table. The op-

TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE yy 

posite edges of the cloth should fall at equal distances from 
the floor. The cloth should fall from twelve to fifteen inches 
below the edges of the table. 

Placing the Decorations 

Now having placed the background for your table-picture, 
focus your composition by placing the table decorations, the 
centerpiece, candlesticks or candelabra, and compotes. 

For a table of six covers, four candles or two candelabra are 
sufficient. The candlesticks are usually placed about halfway 
between the center of the table and its edge, but their position 
depends on the general form and design of the decorations. 
The candles are unshaded. 

Compotes, filled with bonbons or mints or nuts, are usually 
placed between the candlesticks and the edge of the table — 
their position too, depending on the general structural scheme. 

Setting the Covers 

Now you are ready to set the covers. 

A "cover" is the place set for one person at the beginning of 
a meal. It consists of a service plate (called sometimes a "place 
plate," and most appropriately called, a cover plate) , silver 
utensils, napkin, and water glass. 

In setting a cover allow, if possible, the standard space of 
twenty- four inches, this space being measured from the center 
of one plate to the center of the next one. Allow fifteen inches 
for depth. 

Place the cover plate in the exact center of the place, and 
so that the pattern is up, in other words so that the pattern- 
design is given its full beauty-value. 

All the lines of the cover should go either across the table 
or lengthwise of it. Avoid diagonal lines because they attract 
the attention of the eye and take away from the harmony of 
the design. 

Place the knives in a straight line, on the right of the plate, 
parallel to each other, and the spoons on their right. On the left 
place the forks, also in a careful straight line, and lay the napkin 
at the left of the forks with its edges parallel to the forks and 
knives and spoons. When the cover includes a bread and butter 
plate, lay the butter spreader on the edge of the plate so that 



78 

It is parallel to the edge of the table with the handle toward the 
right. Salt and pepper sets should' follow this rule of placing, 
as should the handles of dishes that are placed on the table, and 
if a piece of silver is placed on a dish at the table (for instance, 
the spoon on the plate under the fruit cocktail) it too should 
be placed parallel to the pieces of silver at the sides of the 
plate. 

There are several other important rules for setting a cover^ 
and the basic idea of these rules applies to informal meals as 
much as it does to formal meals. 

Knives, since they are used in the right hand, are placed at 
the right of the plate, with the cutting edge toward the plate- 

Spoons, with the bowls up, are placed at the right of the 
knives. 

Forks are placed at the left of the plate, with the tines up. 
This is because the fork is held in the left hand when the knife 
is in the right hand. If an oyster fork is necessary, it is placed 
on the right of the knives and spoons — and parallel to them — 
or on the plate on which the oysters are served. 

The Silver should be placed in the correct sequence — so 
that the person eating may use first the utensils farthest from 
the plate and "work toward the plate." Not more than three 
knives and three forks (not counting the butter knife or oyster 
fork) are laid at one cover. If necessary, additional pieces are 
laid just before the course is served. Usually the silver is laid 
for the courses through the salad course, and the dessert silver 
is either placed at the cover before the dessert is served, or 
brought in on the dessert plate. For every item of food in the 
menu the necessary piece of silver should either be placed at 
the cover or brought in before the service of the course. 

The Napkin is placed on the left of the forks. If it is folded 
in a square, the open corner is the lower corner, nearest the 
plate. 

The "Water Glass is placed above the tip of the dinner 
knife. If there is a glass for another beverage, it is placed 
to the right of the water glass or in a line slanting down from 
the goblet to the right. If there are more than two glasses, they 
are grouped artistically. 

The Bread and Butter Plate is placed above the tips of 
the forks so that it will be on a line with the water glass. The 
butter spreader is placed on the bread and butter plate parallel 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 79 

to the edge of the table, the handle toward the right and the 
cutting edge down. 

The Place Card is best placed above the plate. 

The Edge of the Service Plate, the tips of the handles 
of the silver utensils, and the lower edge of the napkin shovild 
be placed in exact alignment, usually one inch from the edge 
of the table. Some hostesses prefer that the silver be placed 
two inches from the edge of the table, so that there is a mini- 
mum of danger of its being brushed off the table. 

Salts and Peppers are usually placed between every two 
covers, or individual sets may be placed, or, if there are only a 
few covers, sets may be placed at the ends of the table. 

Salted Nuts may be placed in small individual dishes above 
the covers, or in silver or glass compotes. 

Covers should be placed directly opposite each other. 

The Chairs are placed so that the line of the table-cloth 
is not broken. 

TABLE SERVICE 

Styles of Service 

There are three styles of service: 

Russian: In this style of service all the food is served from 
the kitchen, by attendants. The host and hostess take no part 
in the service. No food is put on the table except the decorat- 
ing dishes of nuts, candy, and fruits. The food may be placed 
in individual portions before the guest, or may be separated 
into portions and arranged on serving-dishes for each guest to 
help himself. 

English or Family Type: In this service all the food is 
served at the table by the host, hostess, or both. 

Combination or Mixed Service: In this service the main 
course is usually served at the table, while the soup, salad, and 
dessert are served from the kitchen. Sometimes, the salad is 
served from a large salad bowl, and the hostess serves the dessert 
at table. 

Service Suggestions 

Methods — ^There are three methods of table service. Tli« 
one often preferred is the left hand service, that is, the placing^ 
passing, and removing of all dishes at the left. Beverages are, 



8o 

of course, an exception, and these are placed at the right. In 
the left hand service, the waitress uses the hand farthest from 
the guest, that is, the left hand. The left hand service permits 
the guest to use his right hand in helping himself. In the right 
hand service the waitress places and removes all dishes from the 
right, using the right hand, but she passes a dish at the left, 
using her left hand. Often a combination of these two services 
is used: that is, the dishes are placed and passed at the left, and 
plates are removed from the right. A hostess decides which 
method seems to her the easiest and most practical for her 
household, and directs her service accordingly. 

Order of Service — In many houses the hostess is served first. 
This is a relic of the old custom of taking it for granted that 
the giver of the feast prove the absence of poison by first tast- 
ing of the food or drinking of the beverage! Some hostesses too 
justify this custom by maintaining that, when complicated foods 
are served, the hostess indicates to her guests the methods by 
which they can most conveniently serve themselves. 

However, the custom of serving the honor guest first is grow- 
ing, and many hostesses now insist on giving the chief guest 
this additional compliment. 

The former custom of serving all the ladies first and the 
gentlemen afterward is no longer in vogue, for this method 
consumed too much time and delayed the service. Now guests 
are served in the order in which they are seated, usually begin- 
ning with the honor guest or the hostess and proceeding to the 
right. 

The Ever-Present Plate — ^It is an important rule of good 
service that there must be a plate before each guest until the 
salad course is removed. As soon as one plate is removed, an- 
other is put in its place. The first course — if a pre-soup course 
— ^is either served from a large dish, in which case a plate is 
placed for it on the cover plate, or is brought in on a plate which 
is set on the cover plate already on the table. 

When the first course is removed the soup plate is set on the 
cover plate. Then, if the next course — an entree, or fish, or 
the main course — ^is, as usual, to be served on a heated plate, the 
service plate is removed with the soup plate as this heated plate 
is put before the guest. 

The "Service Napkin" — On the palm of her left hand^ 
Tinder the dish that she is passing, the waitress holds a napkin 



TABLE SETTING AND SERVICE 8l 

folded in a square — the so-called "service napkin" or "serving 
napkin." She does not use a tray to bring dishes to the table 
or to remove them from the table. 

Using a Tray — ^When a waitress is passing two or three 
small articles such as the cream-pitcher and sugar-bowl, or extra 
pieces of silver, she uses a serving-tray, with a doily on it to 
keep the articles from slipping. 

Filling Glasses — ^Water glasses are filled three-fourths full. 
The water pitcher should be three-fourths full. When a glass 
is being filled it should not be lifted from the table. If neces- 
sary, the waitress uses a napkin to catch the drip. Beverages 
are placed and glasses are filled at the right. 

Knives and Spoons are placed at the right, and forks are 
placed at the left. 

Bread, in the form of plain or pulled bread, rolls, or toast^ is 
passed after the soup has been served. 

If the First Course of an informal dinner or luncheon is a 
cold course, it may be on the table when the guests enter the 
dining-room. If it is hot, it is served after the guests are seated. 

Before Passing a Dish to a Guest the waitress should 
see that adequate silver is placed on the dish — usually a serv- 
ing-fork on the left and a serving-spoon on the right — ^in a 
convenient position. She should, if necessary, rearrange the 
silver before offering the dish to the guest. 

Food Should be Placed on the Table, passed, and re- 
moved in the order of its importance in the course. 

If a Salad is Served With the Meat Course, it is placed 
on the more convenient side of the plate. If there is no extra 
glass on the right side, it is usually more convenient to the guest 
to have the salad placed on the right. 

Hot Food Should be Served Hot on heated dishes. 

Cold Food Should be Served Cold on cold dishes. 

When the Host and Hostess do the Serving at Table, 
the host serves the meat, and often the vegetables, and the hos- 
tess serves the soup, salad, dessert, and beverage. 

In the Maid-Less Household, the hostess will find great 
convenience in the tea-wagon or any other kind of serving- 
table that may stand at her right, ready to help her. 

Before the Dessert Course, the table should be cleaied 
and crumbed. The salts and peppers, the bread and butter 
plates, and all other accessories or dishes that will not be used 



82 

in the dessert course, are removed on a tray. When the table 
is crumbed a small folded napkin and a plate should be used, 
and the crumb-clearing is done at the left of the guest. 

When the Dessert is Finished, the dessert plate is ex- 
changed for an after-dinner coffee cup, if the coffee is served 
at table. 

At the End of the Coffee Course, the cups are ex- 
changed for finger bowls if these were not placed with the 
dessert. 



There is Increasing Inclination to serve after-dinner 
coflFee in the drawing room, living room or the library. The plan 
has many advantages. The original reason was to give guests 
more freedom and more luxury — dining-room chairs are stiflF 
at best. But in large families, young adults and children are 
eager to be excused — the former for their own plans and the 
latter have school work to do, besides which they do not or 
should not drink coffee. The adults want to continue their dis- 
cussions without interruption, while they have coffee, liqueurs 
and smokes at their leisure. 

Besides, in many American homes, servants come in by the 
day or the hour. Serving coffee in the living room, in addition 
to the comfort it gives host and guests, allows maids to finish 
the cleaning-up process with more speed and care as well as 
more freedom. The coffee service can be done last or even left 
until morning without catastrophe. In the maidless home, the 
dining-room doors can be closed, the lights turned out and both 
hostess and guests forget the work that awaits the former, in 
the glow of the larger, more comfortable and less formal living 
room. Moreover, in many modern homes the dining room has 
disappeared and its function taken over by an enlarged living 
room, with or without a dining alcove or solarium but almost 
always when there is a garden, by the terrace used for meals 
out of doors. In homes with this arrangement there should be 
an appropriate screen to set around the table used for dining, 
when the guests move into the living room proper or onto the 
terrace. Often when there is a dining alcove, these screens are 
attached to opposing walls as permanent fixtures of the room, 
and need only to be swung out to meet around the disheveled 
table. For kss formal entertaining see page 724. 



CARVING 



SKILL in carving depends upon two things: first, a knowl- 
edge of the anatomy of that which is to be carved, and 
second, good tools with which to work. 

EQUIPMENT FOR CARVING 

For the Average Family, two carving knives are desirable; 
one with a long, keen blade for large roasts, and a smaller, 
lighter one for steaks, cutlets and poultry. One two-pronged 
fork can be used with both knives. 

For a Small Family, where large joints are not served, the 
smaller knife will be adequate. 

The Carving Knife Should be Sharp when it is brought 
to the table. It should never be sharpened at the table. 

The Carver Should Remain Seated while carving and 
should carve enough for all who are at the table before he 
begins to serve anyone. 

The Platter Should be Large Enough to give room not 
only for the meat that is to be carved but also for the carved 
portions. 

A Serving Spoon should be provided for the gravy. 

TO CARVE BEEF 

Beefsteak 

First separate the meat from the bone by cutting along the 
edge of the bone with the thin point of the knife. 

Beginning with the wide or bone end of a porterhouse or 
sirloin steak, and following the grain of the meat, divide each 
section into portions an inch or slightly more in width, depend- 
ing on the number to be served. 

In porterhouse and similar steaks, the tenderloin and the 
wider section are more tender and have a finer flavor and text- 
ure than the narrow section. Give a serving of the finer quality 
meat and one of the less choice meat to each person. 

The small or flank end of a porterhouse steak is of poor 

S3 



84 

quality, suited only for stewing or braizing, and should not 
be served with the rest of the steak. 

Add to each portion a bit of garnish, a spoon of dish gravy, 
and if the steak is planked, a serving of vegetables. 

Roast Beef 

Carve all roasts across the grain of the meat. The thickness 
of the slices varies with the kind of roast that is being carved, 
and may be influenced by the personal preferences of the people 
for whom the carving is being done. Generally the slices 
should be thin, but whether thin or thick, they should be even 
and attractive looking. 

Fillet or Tenderloin Roast — Hold the roast firmly with 
the fork and cut the meat squarely across the grain in slices 
slightly less than one-half inch in thickness. Begin with the 
thick or forward portion. Serve one slice to each person. 

Loin, Round or Rump Roast — Cut across the grain, as 
with a tenderloin roast, but carve the slices as thin as possible, 
because the meat is less tender than the fillet. 

Standing Rib Roast — Place the roast cut side up on a platter 
with the ribs to the left. Thrust the fork firmly into the side 
below the upper bone and cut slices Ys to 54 inch thick toward 
the fork, across the grain, until the bone is reached. Cut several 
slices and then separate from the bone by cutting down with the 
point of the knife along the bone. 

Chuck Pot Roast — Place the meat with the rib side toward 
the carver. Insert the fork straddling the narrow strip of 
cartilage running down the center of the meat and cut off the rib 
bone. Cut horizontally across grain into slices ^4 inch thick, 
beginning at the right front corner and cutting up through the 
slice at the center of the roast. When one side is sliced reverse 
and cut other side. 

Short Ribs — Place meat so that ribs are at the back. Thrust 
fork into meat and cut down between the bones. A bone may 
be served with each slice. 

Rolled Roast — A rolled roast should be held together for 
carving by skewers thrust directly through the roll across the 
grain of the meat. Set the roast on end and thrust the fork 
firmly into the side an inch or two from the top. Then, hold- 



CARVING 85 

ing the knife horizontally, cut thin even slices across the entire 
roast. 

Remove the skewers one at a time as you reach them in 
carving, and move the fork downward from time to time as 
necessary. 



TO CARVE LAMB, MUTTON, VEAL 
AND PORK 

Leg of Lamb 

Let the small bone extend toward your left and have the 
curved side of the meat uppermost. Thrust the fork into the 
center muscle and cut thin slices downward, across the grain 
of the meat, till the knife strikes the bone. To release the 
slices, insert the point of the knife beneath them and cut along 
the surface of the bone. 

If the leg of lamb is boned, cut slices straight through, across 
the grain of the meat. 

Loin Roast of Lamb, Veal or Pork 

The backbone should be cut through at each rib before the 
meat is roasted. Let the roast lie on the platter with the bones 
down and the smaller end of the roast at your left. Carve 
down between the ribs and serve one rib to each person. 

Crown of Lamb 

Carve down between the ribs and serve one rib to each per- 
son. 

Saddle of Mutton 

Let the roast rest on the platter with the bone down and 
the end diagonally toward you. Make a cut through the 
center the entire length of the backbone, separating the meat 
into two similar parts. Remove the meat from the bone on 
each side by running the knife point between the meat and 
the bone. Carve the meat into slices slightly less than half 
an inch thick, cutting across the grain.

TO CARVE POULTRY 

Roast Turkey or Chicken 

Let the bird rest on its back on the platter, with the drum- 
sticks pointing toward your left. Grasp the carving-fork 
firmly in the left hand, with the tines pointing toward the 
bird's neck and the tips turned from the bird. Insert it into 
the leg so that one tine goes diagonally through the drumstick 
and the other through the second joint. 

Cut all around the hip joint. Press against the side of the 
bird with the flat of the knife and use the fork as a lever to 
bend the leg back. This will separate the hip joint and the leg 
can be lifted off without diflficulty. 

Without removing the fork, lay the leg down flat, with 
the open end pointing-, toward ^he left, and insert the knife 
from right to left between the tines of the fork. Press the 
knife down and it should go through the joint. At first you 
may have to do a little feeling around to locate the joint, but 
with practice you will learn how to insert the fork so that when 
the knife is placed between the tines it will fall directly over 
the joint. 

Next thrust the fork into the side of the bird, rather low 
down, and cut the breast downward in thin even slices. 

Slice the meat from the second joint and serve a slice of 
white meat and a slice of dark meat to each guest. 

If more portions are needed, turn the bird so that it is 
lying with the carved side down. Separate the second leg in 
the same way you did the first, and slice the breast. 

If the wings are needed they may be cut from the bird and 
divided in the same manner as the legs. 

Ordinarily the tips of the wings and the drumsticks are 
not served with the roasted bird but are reserved for other uses. 

Roast Ducks 

Follow the same method as for turkeys and chickens, but 
keep in mind that a duck's joints are much farther toward the 
back than those of turkeys and chickens. 

With Wild Duck, only the breast is served. Half a breast 
is usually removed in one portion and served to one person. 



CARVING 87 



Broilers 

Arrange the bird on the platter so that the neck is toward 
you. Insert the fork in the second joint; cut the flesh around 
the hip joint; bend the joint over sharply with the knife and 
separate it from the body. Separate the drumstick from the 
second joint or leave them together, as you prefer. Split the 
breast in two. Serve half the breast and a second joint or 
whole leg to each person. 

TO CARVE FISH 

Special carving sets are procurable for fish. If such a set is 
not at hand, the best thing to use is a dinner knife, with silver 
plated or stainless steel blade, and a silver fork^ preferably of 
the type known as a cold meat fork. 

In carving any fish try to serve as little bone as possible and 
avoid breaking the flakes of the fish. 

Baked or Planked Fish 

If the fish has been slashed before baking, cut through these 
slashes, to, but not through, the backbone. If there are no 
slashes, cut the flesh crosswise at intervals of about two inches. 
Slip the knife under each section and lift it from the bone. 
When one side of the fish has been served, lift up the back- 
bone and divide the lower half. 

Middle Cuts or Thick Pieces of Fish 

Middle cuts or thick pieces of large fish, such as salmon and 
cod, are placed on the platter with the skin up. Carve the fish 
in thick slices down to the bone, then slip the knife under the 
portions and remove them from the bone. 

Split Fish 

When fish are split down the back and broiled or sauted, 
divide them through the middle, lengthwise, then divide each 
half into as many portions as are needed. Very small fish are 
served whole. 



GARNISHES 



/^ARNISHES serve two purposes. First, they make food 
^^ more attractive to the eye, thus stimulating the flow of 
digestive juices and aiding digestion; second, they add bulk or 
"roughage" to the diet or increase the nutritive value of the 
dish. 

Garnishes Should be Simple, appropriate and easy to pre- 
pare. They should not be used to disguise deficiencies or poor 
quality of any dish. Edible garnishes are more appropriate 
man those that are used merely for appearance. At least one- 
third of a dish should be left free of garnish and the garnish 
should be so placed that it does not interfere with the service, 

With a Few Exceptionsj such as candied or maraschino 
cherries, sweet picklesj preserved whole currants, strawberries, 
cranberries, etc., sweets are not used to garnish savory dishes. 

Toast or Puff Pastes should not^ as a rule^ be used on the 
same dish with potatoes. 



Garnishes for Soups 

One of the simplest garnishes for soup is a tablespoon of 
salted whipped cream sprinkled with a dash of paprika or a 
little parsley chopped very fine. 

Eggs are used as garnishes of soups in the form of a baked 
custard cut in fancy shapes, or as egg balls. (See Soup Ac- 
cessories.) The whole yolks poached in salted water just bdow 
the boiling-point may be used; one yolk is served with each 
pkte of soup. 

Noodles, tapioca, spaghetti or macaroni cut in fancy shapes^ 
or quenelles (See Soup Accessories) make simple and attrac- 
tive garnishes for soup. 

Cooked vegetables cut in thin strips or in Julienne style or 
in fancy shapes or slices, are often used to add color^ flavor and 
nutritive value to a soup. 

Soups may be garnished also with cubes of bread or puff 
paste buttered and browned in the oven or fried in deep fat. 

88 



GARNISHES 89 



Garnishes for Egg Dishes 

Eggs are often served with toast in some form. They may 
be garnished with crisp slices of bacon and a spray of parsley or 
they may be served on a bed of chopped spinach, mashed potato 
or chopped meat. A sauce or puree is a very attractive garnish 
for poached eggs. Eggs are sometimes garnished with grated 
cheese or cooked egg-yolk put through a sieve. 

Garnishes for Hot Vegetables 

Mashed vegetables are sometimes garnished with bits of but- 
ter and a sprinkling of paprika or chopped parsley. Vegetables 
that are cooked and served whole are often covered with grated 
cheese and put into the oven long enough to brown the cheese. 
Slices of hard-cooked eggs or egg-yolk put through a sieve 
may be used as a garnish for spinach. 

Garnishes for Meat, Fish, Game and Poultry 

Garnishes often used with roasts of beef, lamb or mutton are 
browned potatoes, croquettes of potatoes or rice, mashed potato 
cups filled with green peas or diced vegetables, slices of carrot, 
parsnip or turnip sauted or fried in deep fat, or boiled onions 
and sprays of parsley or cress. 

Roast pork may be garnished with any of the above or with 
baked apple or sauted apple rings filled with jelly. 

Fried bananas make a suitable garnish for roast of mutton. 

Chops and steaks may be served with a simple garnish of 
parsley or cress and a slice of lemon or in a border of French 
fried potatoes, Saratoga chips or lattice potatoes. 

Creamed meat dishes may be served with triangles or rounds 
of toast, in borders of rice or mashed potato, in croustades of 
bread, in timbale cases or patty shells or in cups of rice or 
mashed potato. 

Sausage, meat balls or chops are attractive arranged about a 
mound of rice, mashed potato, macaroni or spinach. 

Roast or fried chicken may be served in a border of celery 
or of fried oysters or with a simple garnish of parsley or cress. 

Roast duck is attractive with endive and slices of orange and 
olives or with rice cups filled with currant jelly; roast goose 
with broiled sausage, gooseberry sauce, apple or barberry jelly 



90 

or cooked rings of apple; roast quail with squares of fried mush 
and cubes of currant jelly. 

Fish steaks, broiled fish or baked fish are usually garnished 
with slices of lemon and parsley or cress. Slices of hard-cooked 
eggs are often used as a garnish for fish. Fat fish such as salmon 
may be garnished with slices of cucumber or of tomato or 
whole tomatoes stuffed. Fish may also be garnished with po- 
tatoes, peas, onions or tomato in any form. 

Other garnishes that may be used are celery curls, olives, 
radishes, mushroom caps, small green pickles, strips of green 
pepper or pimiento. 

Garnishes for Aspics and Salads 

The best and simplest frame for any salad is a bed of lettuce 
leaves or shredded lettuce, cabbage or cress. Many salads are 
made more attractive by a sprinkling of chopped nuts or capers, 
minced green pepper or red pimiento or a grating of cheese. 
A half nut-meat, two or three radishes cut to resemble roses, 
dates or prunes stuffed with nuts or cream cheese, olives whole 
or sliced, tiny new onions or sliced green pickles all add flavor 
and color. 

Truffles are wild, edible, subterranean fungi that are raised 
principally in France. They are too expensive to be used in 
large quantity but are highly prized as a flavorful garnish for 
aspics, salads and sauces. Becaiise of their black color they 
make an effective contrast to the pale or vivid colors of the 
more common foods. 

Very attractive decorations for meat, fish, salads or aspic 
are vegetables cut into simple flower designs. Cucumbers, 
beets, turnips, Russian radishes and carrots with chopped 
greens are the materials to have at hand. For a lily, cut a 
long cucumber in half crosswise. Stand up on this cut surface 
and with a sharp knife cut narrow strips, not too thin, from 
tip to within an inch of the base. Continue until all the white, 
too, is cut into strips resembling petals. Into the center in- 
sert a long narrow carrot, root end up, to simulate the yellow 
stamen. If necessary wrap base with a rubber band to hold 
tightly. Beets and round turnips can be peeled and cut to 
resemble budding roses. The turnips can be stained with vege- 
table coloring if desired. Flat slices of turnip or Russian radish

cut to resemble daisies have a center of carrot and a sprinkle 
of chopped green. Calla lilies may be made of thin slices of 
larger turnips. Roll until the edges meet in cornucopia shape 
and fasten with a toothpick. Insert a long slender carrot or 
carrot strip for the stamen and fasten with another toothpick. 
Broccoli, leek, shallot, or spinach leaves may be attached. Easter 
lilies are made the same way except that the petal is split after 
rolling the calyx.

CEREALS 



CEREALS or grains are tlie seeds of certain grasses, the most 
important of which are wheat, oats, rice, barley, corn, 
rye and buckwheat. To most persons "cereals" designate 
only breakfast cereals; and, while the term "cereal foods" 
actually does include also commercial products made from 
cereals such as macaroni and spaghetti, corn-starch and the 
different flours, the present chapter deals only with cereals in 
the breakfast-cereal sense. There are many kinds of breakfast- 
cereal products on the market. Most of them are made from 
the cereals listed above but they differ because of variety in 
the processes of their manufacture. The so-called breakfast- 
cereals have a wide usefulness in meals other than breakfast. 

Storage of Cereals 

'VTith a suitable storage place, cereals and flour may be kept 
for several months. Unless there is a cool, dry place for storing 
them, they should be purchased only in amounts that can be 
used in a few days. This is especially true in warm weather. 

Cereal products are liable to spoilage for two reasons: they 
may become wormy, or they may become rancid. Products 
made from the whole grain are more subject to spoilage than 
the refined products, because the whole products contain the 
germ, which is high in fat, and it is this that becomes rancid; 
it is this, also, that offers suitable material for the development 
of eggs laid by insects. 

Cereals should be purchased from a merchant whose store is 
known to be kept in a sanitary condition. Closed glass jars 
are excellent for keeping cereals. If package cereal is purchased, 
it should be placed in closed glass jars after it is opened, thus 
insuring against infection by insects. 

Whole or Refined Cereals 

Seeds are made up of starchy material in a network of protein, 
and protected by several coats of fiber generally referred to as 
bran or cellulose. In the process of manufacture a part or all 
of the outer coats may be removed so that the actual composi- 



CEREALS 93 

tion of the cereal is a matter determined by the method of 
manufacture. If a large part is removed, the cereal is called 
highly refined.; if a small part is removed, it becomes less 
highly refined; and if the coats are not at all, or but slightly 
removed, it is called "whole." Therefore, the terms "whole" 
and "refined" refer to the amount of outer coating which the 
cereal contains and not to the size of the particles into which 
the grain is ground. 

One way to determine whether cereals are whole or refined 
is by the color. The less highly refined cereals are apt to be 
dark in color, and the more highly refined cereals are light in 
color. 

Pre-Cooked Cereals 

Cereals were formerly bought uncooked, but by modern 
methods of manufacture they may be partly or entirely cooked. 
Thus we have, in oats or wheat, a partly cooked product; and 
the long list of ready-to-eat cereals or entirely cooked products 
which need only a few minutes of reheating to be ready for the 
table. 

Cooking Cereals 

Two of the important secrets in cooking cereals so that they 
are acceptable are: 

1. To alk)W enough water to swell and soften all the starch. 

2. To cook them long enough to swell the starch and soften 
the cellulose present so that the starch may be exposed to the 
action of heat and water. 

Cereals high in starch and low in cellulose or bran absorb 
more water than do cereals containing proportionately less 
starch and more cellulose or bran. Also, coarsely ground or 
unground cereals require more time to cook than the finely 
ground ones. These facts determine the method used in cook- 
ing. A refined cereal will require a proportionately larger 
amount of water than a whole cereal, though it will require 
less time in the cooking; a coarsely ground cereal will require 
longer time than a finely ground cereal. 

Thorough cooking of cereals is necessary for two reasons: 
first, celliilose requires plenty of time to soften; and second, 
starch gains in flavor by cooking. 

Methods of Cooking — Cereals may be boiled directly over 
the heat; steamed, as in a double boiler; or cooked in a fireless 



cooker. The first is the quickest process but requires attention 
in order to prevent sticking; and, even when stirred frequently, 
some sticking may occur. Since the slower cooking develops 
the flavor and more thoroughly softens the cellulose, the use of 
either double boiler or fireless cooker is recommended. 

Amount of Water Needed — ^Tastes differ greatly con- 
cerning consistency of cereals. Some persons like a thin cereal, 
almost a "gruel"; others prefer a thicker product, or "mush," 
while still others choose a thick "porridge." The following sug- 
gestions are only general. The directions on the packages are 
safe to follow in cooking any uncooked or partly cooked cereal, 
then if a thicker or thinner product is desired it is easy to de- 
termine the proportions that best suit the family and make your 
own rules. 

In General: 

1. Rolled cereals, such as rolled oats or rolled wheat, require about 
two parts of water to one of cereal. 

2. Coarsely ground cereals from the whole grain, and unground 
whole grains require about four parts of water to one of cereal. 

3. Finely ground refined cereals require from five to six parts of 
water to one of cereal. 

Where directions are lacking for any cereal bought in bulk, 
the following table will serve as a fair guide.

Amount of Salt Needed— -Tastes differ again here, but a 
safe rule from which to vary is to use one teaspoonful to each 
quart of water used. 

Swelling of Cereals — ^The amount of swelling is the same 
as the amount of water required; that is, rolled cereals swell 
about twice, coarsely ground or whole cereals swell about four 



CEREALS 95 

times; and finely ground and refined cereals swell from five to 
six times. 

Time Needed For Cooking — Cereal products have a nat- 
urally delicious flavor, although not pronounced, which is 
brought out by long slow cooking, and the right proportion of 
water and salt. 

Long slow cooking used to mean four to six hours, but manu- 
facturing processes have cut the time considerably — ^to fifteen 
or twenty minutes in the case of some of the fine grained wheat 
products, and even three to five minutes for partially cooked 
cereals. However, a longer cooking only improves them. 

In trying a breakfast cereal for the first time, follow the 
directions on the package; then if you wish, adapt them to 
the consistency and saltiness you prefer. 

Some cereals may be boiled — notably rice, and those partially 
cooked products that need only three to five minutes cooking, 
and so demand but little constant attention. The standard ways 
of cooking cereals are steaming in a double boiler or baking 
in a slow oven, as in making creamy rice and Indian puddings. 
The baking method has obvious advantages, and can well be 
extended to include cereals for breakfast or entrees, omitting 
the sugar and flavoring. 

If cereal is cooked in the evening for the following breakfast. 
It may stand in the double boiler all night and be heated in the 
morning. It is well not to stir it in the morning until it is 
thoroughly hot, because stirring when cold is apt to cause 
lumps which resist being made smooth. 

Variations in Use of Cereals 

Cereals may be cooked in milk instead of water, or a part of 
the water may be replaced by milk. This method offers an 
easy way of increasing the milk content of a meal and makes 
the cereal dish more nutritious. Raisins, dried fruit or fresh 
fruit supply a pleasing addition to cooked cereals. Dates or 
figs cut into pieces and stirred into the cereal before serving 
make a very appetizing change. 

To prevent a hardening over of the cereal due to standing, 
two or three tablespoons of water may be poured over the top 
of the cereal after the cooking process at night is finished.

YEAST BREADS 



BREAD as a universal article of food has much in its favor. 
Flour, its chief ingredient, is not quickly perishable and 
is rather easily stored and transported. Bread itself keeps well, 
is mild in flavor, is inexpensive and furnishes material needed 
by the human machine. 

Excellent bread can be made of good bread flour, salt, water 
and yeast. Better bread can be made if sugar and fat are added. 
It is in the handling of the dough, not in the proportions of in- 
gredients, that much bread is ruined. 

Flours and Meals Used in Bread-making 

"While flours and meals made from oats, corn, rice and other 
seeds are used to some extent with wheat flour in making yeast 
breads, by far the larger amount of yeast bread is made from 
wheat flour only and most of it is made from highly refined 
white flour. This is because the gluten of wheat flour possesses 
properties of toughness and elasticity which enable the dough 
containing it to stretch and hold gases produced in it by the 
action of yeast or introduced into it by baking-powder. The 
dough rises and becomes light. 

However, the quality of wheat flour depends upon the season 
in which the wheat is grown. Winter wheat is sown in the 
fall, remains in the ground all winter and is harvested in the 
summer. This grain is generally poor in gluten, but rich in 
starch. "Winter wheat is used largely for pastry flour. Spring 
wheat is sown in the spring and is harvested in the summer at 
about the same time as the winter wheat. The grain is generally 
rich in gluten but poor in starch. Spring wheat flours are best 
for bread making. Standard flours are a mixture of spring and 
winter wheat^ and they vary little in quality. 

In Selecting a Flour For Bread-making every effort 
should be made to secure a flour of good bread-making prop- 
erties. Bread flour, when rubbed between the fingers, has a 
granular feeling. It will not hold its shape when pressed in 
the hand. Bread flour can be xised successfully in making 
cakes and pastries. 

97 



98^ 

A Good Pastry Flour differs from bread flour in contain- 
ing more starch and not only less gluten but a less elastic gluten 
than bread flour. It has an oily feeling when rubbed between 
the fingers, and holds its shape when pressed in the hand. 
Pastry flour can not be used successfully in making bread. 

Whole- Wheat or entire-wheat flour, combined in right 
proportions with white flour, can be made into excellent bread. 

Graham Flour, although coarse, may, rightly combined 
with white flour, be made into excellent bread. 

Proportions of Flour and Liquid in Dough 

For one cup of liquid use approximately three cups of flour. 
This proportion varies widely because of differences in the 
absorptive powers of different flours. A good bread flour will 
take up more water than a poor bread flour. Flour, except 
graham or whole wheat, should always be sifted before being 
measured. 

Yeast 

The most satisfactory temperature for the growth of yeast 
is from 75° to 95° F. It ceases to grow when the temperature 
is below 30° F. and is killed at about 212° F. Yeast should not 
be softened in very cold water if immediate activity is desired. 

Compressed Yeast — A cake of fresh compressed yeast 
breaks with a clean edge and has no odor of putrefaction. It is 
creamy yellow and uniform in color. When old, compressed 
yeast becomes slightly slippery, is streaky, and has an un- 
pleasant odor. Only fresh compressed yeast should be used in 
bread-making. In compressed yeast the yeast plants are alive 
and ready for action, hence bread-making with compressed 
yeast requires less time than with dry yeast. 

Dry Yeast — ^Dry yeast is a mass of yeast plants mixed with 
corn-meal and dried. As yeast will live for some time and yet 
can not grow without moisture, these dry cakes will keep for 
many weeks. The dried plants are inactive and even when 
warmth and moisture, food and air are supplied, they take 
some time to become active again. 

Liquid, Railroad or Starter Yeast — This consists of po- 
tato water, sugar and salt, in which yeast plants are in an active 
condition. The starter must be stored in a cool temperature 
to retard the action of the yeast. The disadvantage of liquid 
yeast lies in the fact that other yeasts than those best suited 



YEAST BREADS 99 

for bread-making may be thriving there also, and soon bread 
made from this perpetual yeast may have a characteristic flavor. 
Starter should be thrown out occasionally and remade with a 
fresh yeast cake. 

Amounts of Yeast 

From one-sixth of a cake to four cakes of compressed yeast 
may be used to one cup of liquid in making bread. The amount 
of yeast within this range does not affect the flavor of the bread 
if the dough is handled properly. With the minimum amount 
of yeast, the process will take six hours or more; with the maxi- 
mum amount of yeast, it may, with skillful handling, be com- 
pleted in one hour and twenty minutes. From two tablespoons 
to one cup liquid yeast may be used for each loaf of bread. 

Methods of Using Yeast 

Compressed or dry yeast should be softened in from one- 
fourth to one-half cup of lukewarm water to which one tea- 
spoon of sugar has been added. The compressed yeast may be 
used immediately. The dry yeast may be set aside in a warm 
place for an hour before it is added to the batter. 

Liquids for Bread-making 

All liquids should be boiled or scalded before being used, 
to kill any organisms which might develop in the dough. 

Milk is the best liquid because of its contribution to the food 
value as well as to the appearance of the loaf. It gives a white 
crumb and a rich golden brown crust. The loaf retains its mois- 
ture better than when no milk is used. 

Water is cheap, but has no food value. It produces a satis- 
factory loaf, however. 

Potato Water produces a characteristic crust excellent in 
flavor and hastens the action of the yeast. It darkens the bread 
slightly but gives a loaf which retains its moisture and does not 
get stale as quickly as when water alone is used. 

Miscellaneous Materials Used in Bread 

Sugar is added to improve flavor, to produce a better bloom 
in the crust and to hasten the activity of the yeast. Too much 
sugar slackens or softens the dough. In making large quantities 



100 

of bread, the liquid is decreased if a large quantity of sugar is 
used. 

Salt is used to improve the flavor of bread. Too much salt 
retards the activity of the yeast. 

Fat is added to give slight tenderness to both crust and crumb 
and to improve the keeping qualities of the loaf. Any soft fat 
of mild flavor may be used as shortening in bread. 

Eggs give a yellow color to the crumb and a brown rich bloom 
to the crust. Because of their leavening power, eggs add to the 
lightness of the loaf. 

Currants, Raisins, Dates and Other Fruit add flavor 
and nutrition but have little effect on the texture of the dough. 

Nuts add shortening in addition to flavor and food value. 

General Directions for Making Bread 

Scald All Liquids to ensure destruction of micro-organisms 
which might interfere with the action of the yeast plant. 

Add Fat, Sugar and Salt to the hot liquid and let it cool 
until it is lukewarm. 

Add the Yeast Cake, softened in a small amount of water 
to which one teaspoon of sugar may be added. 

Add the Flour, sifted before measuring, except graham 
and whole-wheat flours, which are measured before they are 
sifted. There are two methods of mixing flour into dough: 

SPONGE METHOD 

Add one-half of the flour to the liquid-and-yeast mixture 
and beat thoroughly. Set in a warm place. When the batter 
is light, add the remaining flour, or enough to make a dough 
of the desired stiffness, and knead thoroughly until it no 
longer sticks to the board. 

STRAIGHT DOUGH METHOD 

Add to the liquid-and-yeast mixture all the flour to be used 
or enough to make a dough of the desired stiffness and knead 
thoroughly until it no longer sticks to the board. This method 
may always be used with compressed yeast. 

Kneading Bread— Press the dough away with the palms of 
your hands. Stretch the dough from the edge, folding the

back edge over to the center. Press the dough away with the 
palms of your hands, exerting sufficient force to cause the part 
folded over to adhere to the mass under it, and repeat folding. 
Turn dough one-quarter around and repeat kneading. Con- 
tinue turning, folding and kneading until dough is smooth 
and elastic and will not stick to an unfloured board. 

First Rising of Dough — Put the dough into a greased 
receptacle large enough to hold at least three times the bulk of 
the dough. Grease the top of the dough, cover the receptacle 
and set in a warm place. Let the dough rise until it trebles its 
bulk. 

Second Rising of Dough — Remove dough from receptacle, 
bring the top around the under side and fold edges together. 
This leaves a ball-shaped mass, round and smooth on the upper 
surface. Bread carefully shaped in this way seems to give a 
much better product than seamy rough dough. Put back in 
receptacle. Grease the dough, cover the receptacle, return to 
warm place to rise again. This second rising is not essential 
but is worth while because it improves both the texture and 
the flavor of bread. 

Shaping into Loaves — Shape by folding the sides of a piece 
of dough under while pressing the dough so as to lengthen it. 
The top should be kept perfectly smooth and the only crease 
in the dough should be on the under side as the loaf is placed 
in the tin. If a soft crust is desired, grease the dough. To braid, 
cut into three, roll lengthwise, pinch together at one end, and 
proceed. Cover and allow to rise until double its bulk. 

Baking Bread — A loaf of average size should bake from fifty 
to sixty minutes at a beginning temperature of about 400° F. 
After fifteen or twenty minutes, the temperature of the oven 
may be reduced. A moderate heat for sixty minutes produces 
better bread than a hot oven for thirty minutes. 

The baking process may be divided into four periods: 

First 1 5 minutes the dough should continue to rise. 

Second 1 5 minutes the dough should crust over and brown 
slightly. 

Third 1 5 minutes the center of the loaf should bake and the 
crust continue to brown. 

Fourth 15 minutes the loaf should shrink from the sides of 
the tin and should be browned evenly over its entire surface. 
It should have a hollow sound when tapped. 



102 

Bread is baked to complete the rising, kill the yeast plants, 
drive otf the carbon dioxide and alcohol, dextrinize the crust, 
harden the cell walls of the crumb and develop the desired 
flavor. 

Tests for Determining When Bread Is Done 

1. When the color is a rich golden brown. 

2. When the loaf shrinks away from the sides of the pan. 

3. When the sides of the pan sizzle when touched with 

a damp finger. 

4. When a clean toothpick inserted comes out free from 

any particles of the dough. 

5. When the loaf gives a hollow sound on being tapped. 

Characteristics of a Good Loaf of Bread 

Size and Shape — ^A medium-sized loaf made of dough 
weighing from one pound to one and one-quarter pounds costs 
less to bake and is more likely to be thoroughly baked than a 
very large loaf. A moderate-sized loaf is about four or £.ve 
inches deep, eight or nine inches long, and four or five inches 
wide. 

The careful shaping of the dough is the first step necessary 
in making a well-shaped loaf of bread. 

Color — ^Bread should have a good bloom and be golden 
brown in color with a depth of crust on top, bottom and sides. 
The crumb should be cream- white in color with no dark streaks 
through it. A grayish color indicates poor flour or poor 
handling of the dough. 

Texture — ^Nothing is more difficult to describe than texture, 
nothing more indicative of quality. Perfect texture of the 
crumb depends on kneading the dough until it is smooth and 
elastic and until it can be kneaded on an unfloured board with- 
out sticking. It depends on having the dough rise to double 
or treble its size once or twice before it is made into the loaf^ 
and once in the tins. It depends on careful baking. To de- 
termine the texture of the crumb, cut the loaf in two. The 
holes should be small and uniform with no streak near the bot- 
tom of the loaf and no lumps through the loaf. Press the 



YEAST BREADS 103 

center of the loaf with the knuckles; if the elasticity and mois- 
ture are right, the loaf should spring back to shape. 

The crust should be smooth without large holes on the bot- 
tom and without a split on one side of the loaf. If the top 
crust is rough it may be due to insufficient kneading or to 
putting the dough into the tins before it is perfectly smooth. 

Flavor and Odor — A well-made, well-baked loaf will 
taste slightly sweet, neither too fresh nor too salty, and will 
have no suggestion of acidity, rawness or mustiness. 

Common Causes of Inferior Bread 

Poor Flour — A cheap flour is an expensive flour because it 
makes a loaf inferior in texture, color, flavor and volume. 

Old Yeast — ^Dead yeast plants can not leaven bread. Old 
compressed-yeast cakes or dry yeast which has been stored 
away until many of the yeast plants are dead will act very 
slowly if at all and will not give best results. 

Too Much or Too Little Kneading — Over-kneaded 
dough becomes sticky and will not rise well in the oven. Un- 
der-kneaded dough makes streaked bread, poor in texture, 
which sometimes contains lumps that might have been worked 
out in the kneading. 

Too Much Flour — ^Too stiff a dough rises very slowly and 
therefore often is not allowed to rise sufficiently. This is a 
green dough and produces a loaf with poor flavor. 

Over-Rising — ^Too long rising gives a very porous loaf with 
little flavor, a pale crust and a porous crumb with broken, irreg- 
ular cells. This bread crumbles badly. If the rising continues 
too long, the bread is sour. 

Under-Rising — ^This gives a bread of dark crust which has 
blisters just under the crust. The loaf is small and flat. It 
browns easily in the oven. Such dough is said to be green. 

Too Cool an Oven — ^Bread will continue to rise too long 
if the oven temperature is too low. The result is bread that is 
very porous in the center and upper part of the loaf. 

Too Hot an Oven — ^The dough crusts over immediately 
and can not continue to rise the first ten or fifteen minutes it 
is in the oven, or the crust may break as it is forced up — 
usually on one side more than the other. The crust becomes 
very brown while the center is underdone. 

RoPM in Bread— This appears during hot, damp weather. 



104 

It is due to the presence of a bacillus and the ropy, stringy- 
quality does not develop immediately after the bread is baked. 
Rope gives bread a very disagreeable odor and makes it unfit 
for use. 

If rope develops all utensils used in making bread and con- 
tainers in which bread is stored should be sterilized with boil- 
ing water. Vinegar equal to two per cent, of the amount of 
flour used should be added to all bread made until the supply 
of flour is exhausted. This is approximately one-half ounce 
(one tablespoon) of vinegar to one and one-half pounds of 
flour. 

Mold — Bread wrapped while hot molds quickly. Containers 
used for storing bread should be washed and aired frequently, 
and immediately if mold is found. 

Care of Bread After Baking 

Bread should be removed from the tins as soon as it is taken 
from the oven, and placed on racks or crosswise of the tins so 
that air can circulate on all sides of it. Quick cooling prevents 
loss of moisture. 

Varying from Recipes in Making Bread 

Water may be substituted for milk in all bread recipes. This 
is not always desirable, however, as one purpose of milk is to 
increase the nutritive value of bread. 

In recipes using compressed yeast, one cup potato yeast may 
be substituted for one cake compressed or dry yeast. When 
potato yeast is used it is necessary to use a little more flour.

YEAST BREADS 109 



VARIATIONS OF STANDARD ROLL RECIPE 

Plain Rolls — When dough is Hght, cut or tear it into 
pieces about the size of a small eg§ or a walnut. Fold the 
sides under until the top of the roll is perfectly smooth. Brush 
the top with fat. Place in greased bread tin or on bread sheet 
or in individual molds. When light, bake in a hot oven (400°- 
425° F.) 

Cinnamon Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe. When 
dough is light, roll into a sheet about one -fourth inch thick, 
spread liberally with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar and 
cinnamon. Add currants if desired. Roll like jelly-roll. With 
sharp knife or shears cut slices from the roll and place them 
an inch apart on a well-greased sheet. When light, bake in 
hot oven (400° -42 5° F.) about twenty minutes. When baked, 
the tops may be brushed with the yolk of egg diluted with a 
tablespoon of milk and returned to oven to brown. 

Clover-Leaf Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe. When 
light, break dough into small pieces about the size of marbles. 
Brush with fat and place three or four of these tiny balls close 
together in greased muffin rings or pans. When very light, 
bake about fifteen minutes in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.). The 
success of these rolls depends on having the three balls together 
equal only as much dough as an ordinary roll would require 
and letting them rise very light before baking them. 

Crescent Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe, adding flour 
to make a stiffer dough than for most rolls. When light, cut 
the dough into small pieces the shape of triangles. Brush with 
fat. Roll each triangle, beginning at the base. Press dough 
lightly with palm of hand, bringing ends around to form a 
crescent. Place on tins some distance apart. When light, bake 
in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.) fifteen minutes. Brush with egg- 
yolk mixed with milk and return to oven for browning. 

Dinner Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe, using four 
tablespoons shortening, desired amount of sugar and two egg- 
whites. Add one-half the flour, beating until smooth, then 
add the beaten whites of eggs. Add the remainder of the flour, 
knead lightly and let rise. When light, cut or break dough 
into rolls the size of walnuts. Shape, place on well-greased 
pans, one-half to one inch apart, let rise and glaze with white 
of egg diluted with water. Bake in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.). 



no 

Finger Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe and when light 
cut and shape into long pieces about the size and shape of a 
finger. Place on well -greased pan, brush with melted fat or 
egg-white. When light, bake in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.). 

Luncheon Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe using 6 to 
S tablespoons of shortening. Add two well-beaten eggs after 
one-half the flour has been added. Add remaining flour and 
knead. "When light shape into small biscuits. Place one inch 
apart in well-greased pan. When double in bulk, brush with 
egg-yolk diluted with milk and bake in hot oven (400°- 
425° F.). 

Parker House Rolls (Pocket-Book Rolls) — Follow 
standard roll recipe. Four tablespoons each of sugar and short- 
ening give excellent results. When light, roll dough one- 
fourth inch thick. Cut with biscuit-cutter, brush each circle 
with melted fat and crease through the center of each roll with 
the dull edge of a knife. Fold each roll over double. Place 
on well-greased pan one inch apart, brush with melted fat and 
when very light bake in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.). 

Twisted Rolls — ^Follow standard roll recipe. When light, 
break dou^ into small pieces and roll out with palm of hand 
into rolls about seven inches long and one-half inch thick, 
taking an end of each strip between the thumb and forefinger 
of each hand, twist in opposite directions and bring the ends 
together. Shape the two ends alike, place one-half inch apart 
on well-greased pans, brush with melted fat or egg-yolk diluted 
with milk. When light, bake in hot oven (400° -42 5° F.). 

Tea Biscuit — Follow standard roll recipe. When dough is 
light, roll and cut with biscuit-cutter. Place on well-greased 
pans one-half inch apart. When light bake in hot oven (400°- 
42r F.). 

English Muffins — ^Follow standard roll recipe, making a 
very soft dough. Knead lightly until smooth and elastic. Work 
down and when light again roll out with rolling-pin to about 
one-fourth inch in thickness. Cut in circles. When light, bake 
on tmgreased hot griddle. As soon as they are brown on one 
side, turn them over. When both sides are browned, bake 
more slowly until finished. They may be browned on the 
griddle and then put into the oven to finish baking. 

A modification of this recipe may be made by adding only 
enough flour to make a drop batter. Let it rise until light. 
Drop batter into large, greased English muffin rings, arranged 



YEAST BREADS III 

on a greased baking-sheet. Bake in a hot oven (400° -425° 
F.) until nearly done. Turn rings upside down and complete 
baking.

Scald the milk and cool it. Cream the shortening and sugar, 
add the milk and salt. Add the dissolved yeast, the egg-white, 
well beaten, and the flour. Knead and let it rise. Shape into 
sticks about the size of a lead pencil. Put into a floured pan, 
far apart; the sticks must not touch one another after they have 
risen. When light, put into a hot oven (400° *F.) then de- 
crease the heat so that the sticks may become dry and crisp. 

MONTE CARLO BREAD 

2 cups scalded milk 2 yeast cakes softened in

warm, add the yeast. Add one-half the flour and beat well. 
Let rise until very light. Add slightly beaten eggs, currants 
and remaining flour. Knead lightly, let rise and when light 
place in well-oiled bread-pans. Let rise and when light bake in 
moderate oven (400° to 375° F.). When the bread is a fe\v; 
days old, cut in thick slices and toast. 

SWEDISH TEA RING 

1 cup scalded milk 1 yeast cake softened in 
% teaspoon salt Ya cup warm water 

14 cup sugar 3^ cups flour 

6 tablespoons shortening 1 tg^ 
% cup finely chopped nuts 

Add the scalded milk to the salt, sugar and fat. When luke- 
warm add the yeast. Add one-half the flour and beat well. 
Let rise until very light. When light add the Qg% and the re- 
maining flour and beat well. Let rise. Divide the dough into 



112 

two parts and shape each in a long, round piece and form two 
circles, placing the circles on a baking-tin. Brush with white 
of egg and sprinkle with finely chopped nuts. With a large 
pair of scissors cut toward the center of the ring, but not quite 
to the center, at intervals of two inches, placing the cut section 
each time flat on the tin, giving it a petal-like appearance. 
When light, bake in a hot oven (400° F.). 



RUSKS 

1 cup scalded milk ^ teaspoon salt 

Yz to 1 yeast cake softened in 2 tablespoons sugar 

y4 cup warm water Yz cup shortening 

3 Yz to 4 cups flour (enough 1 egg 

to make a soft dough) 

Cool the milk, add the yeast and one-half the flour. When 
light add salt, sugar, shortening, egg and remaining flour. Knead 
lightly on well-floured board. Let rise until double in bulk, 
roll out and cut with biscuit-cutter. Place on well-oiled pans, 
let rise and bake in hot oven (400° F.). 



RAISED BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

2 cups boiling water 1 tablespoon molasses 

Yz cup corn-meal 1 teaspoon salt 

Yz yeast cake 2 cups buckwheat flour 

Y4 cup warm water 1 teaspoon soda 
Yi cup hot milk 

Pour the boiling water over the corn-meal and let stand until 
it swells. Soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. After the 
corn-meal is cool, add the molasses, salt, yeast and flour. Beat 
thoroughly and set in a warm place to rise over night. It 
should rise and fall again by the morning. Then add a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in the hot milk^ stir well^ and bake on a hot 
griddle. 

When the cakes are desired frequently (say, three times a 
week), fresh yeast will not be required after the first making, 
if a little more than a pint of the batter is reserved each time 
and kept in a cool place to be used instead of the yeast. Mo- 
lasses in buckwheat cakes helps to give them a good color in 
frying. Without it, they may be gray and unattractive.

dough, if desired. 

BRIOCHE 

1 cup milk, scalded 2 yeast cakes 

1/^ cup butter % cup lukewarm water 

2 teaspoons salt 4 eggs, well beaten 
y2 cup sugar Melted butter 

A\/2 cups bread flour 

Scald milk and add butter, salt and sugar; stir until butter 
dissolves. When tepid, add yeast previously soaked in water, 
and beaten eggs. Sift flour before measuring, beating well into 
mixture. Allow to rise in warm place six hours. Refrigerate 
over night or until ready to use. Form quickly into small balls 
to J/3 size of mufEn tins or glasses. Brush tops with melted 
butter and let rise until double in bulk. Bake in hot oven 
(400° F.) for 20 minutes. 

For Braids — Dust a bread-board lightly with flour and roll 
brioche dough gently into a sheet about one-half inch thick. 
Cut the dough in strips one-half inch wide, leaving one end 
uncut. Place on greased baking-sheet and brush the cut edges 
with melted fat. Fold the strips over each other to form a 
braid. Pinch both ends of braid together, flatten, and press 
down on pan to prevent strips separating and losing shape.

low the sponge to stand in a warm place until it is so light that 
it will fall at the slightest touch. Add the egg, nutmeg, and 
remainder of the flour and knead. The dough should be softer 
than bread dough. Cover and set in a warm place to rise. Toss 
on a lightly floured board and roll until three-fourths inch 
thick. Cut with a doughnut cutter and let rise. Fry in deep 
fat (3 60° -3 70° F.) two to three minutes. When frying, put 
the raised side of the doughnut down in the fat. The heat 
will cause the top side to rise by the time the doughnut is ready 
to turn. 

SALT RISING BREAD 

1 cup milk 1 tablespoon melted shorten- 

2 tablespoons white corn-meal ing (may be omitted) 
1 teaspoon salt Flour 

1 tablespoon sugar 

Scald the milk. Allow it to cool until it is lukewarm; then 
add the sugar, corn-meal and salt. If shortening is used, add it. 
Place in a fruit can or a heavy crock or pitcher and surround 
by water at about 120° F. Water at this temperature is the hot- 
test in which the hand can be held without inconvenience. 
Approximately this temperature can be secured by mixing equal 
parts of boiling water and cold (not icy) water. Allow the 
mixture to stand for six or seven hours, or until it shows signs 
of fermentation. When it is fermented sufficiently the gas can 
be heard as it escapes. This leaven contains enough liquid for 
one loaf. If more loaves are needed, add 1 cup water, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 tablespoonful shortening 
for each additional loaf to be made. Beat thoroughly and put 
the sponge again at the temperature of about 120° F. When it 
is very light, add more flour gradually until the dough is so stiff 
that it can be kneaded without sticking to the hands or to the 
board. Knead ten or fifteen minutes; put at once into the 
pans; allow to rise until about two and one-half times its 
original bulk, and bake. This bread is never so light as bread 
raised with yeast. A loaf made with one cup of liquid therefore 
will come not quite up to the top of a pan of standard size.

USES FOR STALE BREAD 

Many ways to prepare stale bread for use in canapes are 
found on page 159. Use the cookie cutter freely to produce 
additional designs. For bread croustades see page 329. If a 
lid is wanted, cut slice of stale bread to fit and toast, using an 
olive or radish attached with a toothpick for a knob handle 
(page 314). 

Day-old rolls make excellent quick canapes. Cut off one end, 
scoop out soft center and pack the shell tight with any good 
canape paste: anchovy butter, sardine paste, deviled lobster 
paste, Roquefort cheese, or any other favorite. Wrap in wax 
paper and keep in refrigerator. "When needed slice thin, arrange 
carefully on a tin and brown lightly under the broiler. Garnish 
with olive rings, radish slices or parsley. 



QUICK BREADS 



QUICK breads are those breads or bread-like mixtures which 
, are made up and baked at once. The essentials of quick 
breads are a liquid and flour. When leavening agents are used 
they act quickly and make the mixture light without a long 
period of waiting. 

Quick breads may be improved in flavor and texture by the 
addition of salt, sugar, eggs, shortening, etc., in various com- 
binations and proportions. Shortening and eggs contribute 
liquid to the mixture, which explains apparent discrepancies in 
proportions given in various recipes for quick breads. 

Ready-to-Use Flours — Prepared flours which contain 
leavening and other ingredients require only milk or water to 
make excellent griddle cakes. The addition of eggs and shorten- 
ing produces a batter suitable for mufiins, waffles, and similar 
quick breads. 

Types of Quick Breads 

There are four types of quick breads — the pour batter, the 
drop batter, the soft dough and the stiff dough; the latter is 
seldom used. 

[The Pour or Thin Batter will pour easily from a spoon or 
a pitcher and can vary in degree of thinness. The breakfast 
puflf and the popover mixtures are examples of the thinnest 
batter, while the griddle-cake and the waffle mixtures are ex- 
amples of a thicker pour batter. 

The Drop, or Thick, Batter does not pour readily, but 
drops In a soft moist mass from a spoon or must be shaken or 
helped free from it. Mufflns and fritters are examples of the 
drop batter. 

The Soft Dough can be handled more or less easily. Biscuits 
and some cookie mixtures are examples of the soft dough. 

The Stiff Dough can be handled easily, and some force 
must be used to roll it out. The Southern beaten biscuit and 
noodles are examples of the stiff dough.

Approximate Proportions of Liquid to Flour in Making 
Quick Breads 

Pour or Thin Batter — ^Use 1 cup liquid with I to V/z cups flour 
Drop or Thick Batter — Use 1 cup liquid with 1 ^ to 2 cups flour 
Soft Dough — ^Use 1 cup liquid with 2 to lYz cups flour 
Stiff Dough — ^Use 1 cup liquid with 4 to 5 cups flour 

Methods of Mixing Quick Breads 

Muffin Method — This method is usually used for the 
batter type of quick bread. The dry ingredients are mixed and 
sifted, then the liquid and egg (if used) are added, either 
separately or combined. When well mixed, the melted shorten- 
ing is beaten in. 

Cake Method— This method is used for the richer muffins. 
The shortening is creamed, the sugar stirred in, then the beaten 
egg added. The rest of the dry ingredients are mixed and sifted 
and added gradually to the first mixture alternately with the 
liquid. 

Biscuit Method — ^The dry ingredients are mixed and sifted 
and the shortening cut in with knives or worked in with the 
tips of the fingers, it being necessary to keep the fat hard until 
the dough goes into the oven. If the shortening becomes warm, 
or is melted, the result is not flaky and flakiness should be a 
characteristic of biscuits. 

PopovER Mixtures should be thoroughly beaten with an 
egg-beater for several minutes, in order to introduce as much 
air as possible and to break the liquid present into tiny droplets. 
The mixture, being very thin, will not hold air very long, so 
it should be poured immediately into the baking containers, 
which may be of tin, glass, aluminum, earthenware, iron or 
steel. If metal containers are used, they should be hot when 
the batter is poured into them, so that the baking may begin 
as soon as the pans are put into the oven. A hot oven is needed 
at first and until the batter has risen to full height, then the 
temperature should be reduced in order to prevent burning. 

For Griddle-cakes and Waffles the griddles and irons 
should stand perfectly level; then if the batter is poujred 
steadily from a pitcher or from the tip of a large spoon, it will 
spread itself evenly. 

Muffin Mixtures and Similar Batters should be stirred 



QUICK BREADS 1 19 

and beaten only enough to combine ingredients thoroughly and 
produce smoothness of texture. The muffins should be baked 
at once. 

Soft Doughs should be handled as little as possible and 
kneaded only enough to make a smooth surface, free from dry 
flour. Much kneading develops a stretchiness in the dough 
which detracts from flakiness. The dough should be rolled or 
patted out to one-half inch or more in thickness if thick, soft 
biscuits are desired, or rolled out to one-quarter inch in thick- 
ness if thin, crusty biscuits are desired. The biscuits should 
be baked at once. 

Baking Temperatures For Quick Breads 

All quick breads should be baked in a moderate to hot oven 
(350°-460° F.). 

POPOVERS 

1^ cups flour 1 teaspoon sugar 

% teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 

2 eggs 

Mix the flour, salt and sugar. Gradually add the milk and 
the well-beaten eggs. Beat thoroughly. Have ready some small 
ramekins or muffin-pans, well greased and piping hot. Fill 
them about half full of the batter and bake in a hot oven 
(450° F.) for twenty minutes. Lower to 350° F. and bake 
fifteen to twenty minutes more. 

SWEET MILK GRIDDLE-CAKES 

3 cups flour 1 tablespoon sugar 
2 teaspoons salt 2 cups milk 

lYz tablespoons baking- 1 e%g 

powder 1 tablespoon melted fat 

Mix and sift the dry ingredients and add the milk, gradually, 
beating constantly to make a smooth batter. Add the beaten 
e%% and the fat and bake on a hot griddle. This makes a thick 
bready cake. If a thinner cake is desired, use more milk. 

SOUR MILK GRIDDLE-CAKES 

Use recipe for sweet-milk griddle-cakes, substituting thick 
sour milk for sweet and using one teaspoon of soda instead of 
the baking-powder. If thicker than liked, use water to thin.

QUICK BREADS 121 

in the flour and baking-powder, mixing well, and lastly add 
the eggs, well beaten. Bake on a hot griddle. The cakes should 
be small, well browned and thoroughly cooked; they need a 
little longer cooking than wheat griddle-cakes. 

FLANNEL CAKES 

1 tablespoon shortening 1 teaspoon salt 

2 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking-powder 

2 cups milk 2 eggs 

Rub the shortening into the flour, and add the salt and bak- 
ing-powder. Beat the yolks of the eggs light, add the milk 
to them and beat well. Add the liquid to the flour mixture, 
stirring until quite smooth. Beat the whites light, add them 
to the batter, and bake on a hot greased griddle. 

FRENCH OR JELLY PANCAKES 

3 eggs 1 cup milk 

1 teaspoon sugar Yz cup flour 

Yz teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon shortening 

Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs. To the beaten 
yolks add the sugar, salt and one-half cup of milk. Stir in 
the sifted flour, the other half cup of milk, the melted shorten- 
ing, then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. When 
eggs are high, two eggs and a half teaspoon of baking-powder 
may be used. 

Bake on a hot griddle, making the cakes slightly larger than 
usual. Spread each cake with tart fruit jelly and roll while hot* 
Place all on a platter, side by side, with the lapped edge of the 
roll touching the bottom of the platter to keep the cake from 
spreading. Dredge with sugar and, if desired, burn lines on the 
sugared surface with a red hot wire toaster. This gives an 
attractive appearance and a slight flavor of burnt sugar. 

APPLE FLAPJACKS 

1 tablespoon shortening 1 teaspoon baking-powder 

1 tablespoon sugar 1 cup apples, chopped fine 

2 eggs Cinnamon 
1/4 cups flour Milk

flour sifted with the baking-powder and cinnamon, and the 



122 

chopped apples. Then gradually add milk to make a medium 
batter. Bake on a griddle as for ordinary pancakes and serve 
in an overlapping row around a platter of pork chops, or serve 
separately with roast pork, either hot or cold. Cooked apples 
or a dry apple sauce may be used with batter in the same way. 

POTATO PANCAKES 

2 cups grated potato Salt 



1 ^ss 


Pepper 


2 tablespoons flour

Scrub and pare the potatoes and grate into cold water to 
keep them from discoloring. Drain well and add the egg, well- 
beaten, the flour, and sufficient milk to make a stiff batter. 
Season with salt, pepper and onion-juice. Cook in a frying- 
pan with hot fat to the depth of about one-half inch. A large 
spoonful of batter makes a good-sized cake. Cook until well 
browned and crisp and serve as a vegetable with meat and 
gravy. Especially good with a stew.

SANDWICHES 



AN encyclopedia published about 1900 defines a sandwich 
as "an article of food consisting of a slice of meat, fish, 
fowl or other food placed between two slices of bread, which 
may be plain or buttered." No such simple definition could 
be given today, for from these simple beginnings the sandwich 
has developed in all directions, and has adapted itself to such 
varied needs that it ranges from a fragile morsel served with 
afternoon tea to an elaborate combination of toast, meat, let- 
tuce, tomato, sauce, and any number of other things which 
combine to make it a complete and satisfying meal. 

Even the requirement of two slices of bread with something 
between them is no longer in force. "Open-faced" sandwiches 
offer almost unlimited opportunity for variety in both cold 
and hot meals. In these the slices of bread or toast are laid 
side by side. Sometimes, usually in hot meat sandwiches, both 
slices are covered with beef or chicken, or whatever gives the 
characteristic flavor, and the whole is covered with gravy. 
Often, especially in cold sandwiches, one slice holds its chicken 
or tomato or crab meat, while its companion is covered with 
cole slaw and dill pickles or a lettuce leaf holding a spoonful 
of mayonnaise. The possibilities are endless, and the sug- 
gestions given here can be combined and adapted to almost any 
requirement where a sandwich can be called into service. 

Serving Sandwiches 

Garnishes of fine parsley, cress, celery plumes, stuffed or ripe 
olives, or slices of lemon or pickle are effective on the serving- 
dish. Barberries and leaves, fresh nasturtium leaves and 
blossoms, or something to indicate the kind of sandwich may 
be used as a garnish. 

Making and Keeping Sandwiches 

The bread for flat sandwiches should be a day old because 
it can be cut more easily than fresh bread. For rolled sand- 
wiches fresh bread should be used. Bread baked in special 
tins which provide slices that are perfect squares or circles is 

131 



132 

economical when the crusts are to be cut off, but any loaf of 
comparatively fine grain may be used. 

The Bread 

All Sorts of Breads are made into sandwiches — white, 
brown, rye, graham, whole-wheat, raisin, date, nut, etc. Some- 
times two or more kinds are used together. Long narrow rolls 
are attractive when sliced lengthwise, buttered and filled. For 
picnics, where a substantial filling is desirable, the crumb of the 
roll may be removed and the hollow filled with sandwich ma- 
terial. Thin salt wafers and crackers are often used instead of 
bread for paste sandwiches. 

For Fancy Sandwiches, to be used for tea or receptions,- 
or as an appetizer at the beginning of the meal, or to be served 
with the salad, the bread should be cut into slices as thin as 
possible and the crusts should be removed. Use a sharp knife, 
so that there will be no ragged edges. 

Picnic and Lunch-Box Sandwiches are cut somewhat 
thicker than fancy sandwiches, and the crusts are generally 
left on. 

Butter and Filling 

The filling and butter for sandwiches should be increased m 
proportion to the thickness of the slice of bread. 

Preparing the Butter — The butter should be thoroughly 
creamed before it is used or it will not spread evenly over the 
bread. To cream butter, place it in a warm bowl and mash 
and beat it until it is soft. It will then spread well even on 
fresh bread. Sandwich butters are often made by creaming 
one cup of butter with one-half cup of cream. One-half cup 
of butter, creamed, will spread a two-pound sandwich loaf 
cutting forty to forty-five slices. 

Relishes such as mustard, salt, grated horseradish, chopped 
parsley, chives and curry may be added to creamed butter for 
use in sandwiches of meat, tomato, game, chicken^ fish, cheese 
or eggs. 

> Spreading Butter and Filling — ^A poorly buttered sand- 
wich is very unpalatable. Spread the butter to the very edges 
of the slices^ on the sides that are to be put together, being 
careful, however, not to let the butter spread over the edges 
So that it is untidy. If the slices need not be fitted together, 
it is often easier to spread the bread before cutting it from the 



SANDWICHES 133 

loaf. A pliable knife or small spatula is a help in spreading 
butter or filling. 

Spread the filling on the buttered surface of one slice only 
of each sandwich. Have the filling come to the edge of the 
sandwich, if possible. 

When mayonnaise is used, not combined with a filling, as in 
mayonnaise and lettuce sandwiches, it is more evenly distributed 
if it is spread on one of the slices of bread and the lettuce leaf 
placed upon it. 

Shaping the Sandwiches 

Sandwiches may be cut with a knife into triangles, oblongs 
and similar outlines, or shaped with cutters into hearts, circles, 
crescents or any preferred design. When sandwiches are shaped 
with these fancy cutters, the bread should be shaped before it 
is spread, to avoid waste of butter and filling. Care must be 
taken afterward, however^ not to spoil the shape while spread- 
ing. Heart,^ club, spade and diamond shapes are popular for 
card parties. Heart shapes are attractive for valentine and an- 
nouncement parties and for showers. Strips, triangles, circles, 
crescents and rolled and folded sandwiches are used for teas. 

Rolled Sandwiches — Cut the crusts from a fresh loaf of 
bread (or if a stale loaf of bread is used, cut off the crusts and 
wrap for an hour in a cloth wrung from cold water) . Spread 
a thin layer of butter on one end of the loaf and then cut from 
it as thin a slice as possible. If a filling is used, spread it on the 
buttered slice. Roll this slice with the spread side inward and 
lay it on a napkin, with the edge of the slice downward. When 
all the sandwiches have been prepared, draw the napkin firmly 
around the rolls and put them in a cold place until needed. The 
butter will harden and hold the rolls together. 

Time Savers in Sandwich Making 

In making sandwiches in quantity, route the work so that 
there will be no waste motions. Have a large enough space 
for (1) cutting the bread; (2) spreading the slices with butter 
and filling; (3) shaping and (4) wrapping the sandwiches. 

Keeping Sandwiches 

Sandwiches are best prepared just before serving, especially 
if the filling is of a kind that will become limp or soak into the 



134 

bread. When it is necessary to make sandwiches several hours 
before they are to be used, they may be wrapped in paraffin 
paper or a sHghtly dampened cloth or placed in a stone jar. 

Filling for Meat and Salad Sandwiches 

When sliced meat is used, a sandwich is easier to eat and 
generally more palatable if the meat is cut as thin as a knife- 
blade with several tiny slices instead of one thick one in each 
sandwich. Fancy butters are excellent with sliced meat. 

All kinds of potted and minced meats are used between slices 
of bread with or without mayonnaise. Salted meat and fish 
fillings are improved by lemon- juice, chopped pickles or capers. 
Pastes of fresh fish and meat require high seasoning. 

All forms of meat may be used with lettuce or cress, between 
two slices of buttered bread, with or without salad dressing. 
The slices should be pressed together and the crust trimmed, if 
desired. Lettuce may be used in large, crisp leaves, or in "rib- 
bons," to make the sandwich easier to eat. Where mayonnaise 
dressing is used, the sandwiches should be made at the last 
moment, and served promptly. Tomatoes and cucumbers with 
lettuce and mayonnaise make delicious salad sandwiches. 
Filling for Tea Sandwiches 

The tea sandwich is seldom made of meat, though such things 
as minced chicken, lobster, or crab meat, and sardines beaten 
to a paste, are sometimes used for it. The bread is cut very 
thin and the fillings may be a bit of lettuce spread with mayon- 
naise dressing, chopped olives, nasturtiums, watercress and 
similar morsels. An attractive sandwich is made from diminu- 
tive Vienna rolls split not quite through and spread with vege- 
table filling. Another tea sandwich is made by spreading jelly 
or preserves between two salt crackers. If the crackers are 
spread with a thin film of butter and crisped quickly in a hot 
oven, this form of sandwich is really worth eating. Almond 
sandwiches of all varieties are delicious for the tea-table. 

Filling for Sweet Sandwiches 

Preserves of all kinds, drained from their sirup, marmalade,- 
jam, jelly, crystallized and candied fruits are used for sweet 
sandwiches with graham or salt wafers, as well as with bread or 
sponge cake. The crystallized fruits may be sliced thin and 



SANDWICHES 135 

dipped in cream, chopped fine, moistened in orange- juice, and 
spread between bread or lady-fingers. 

Scraped or grated maple sugar mixed with chopped nuts 
is used with brown bread. Ice-cream is cut in slices and put 
between wafers or layers of sponge cake. 

Tiny tea biscuits make an excellent foundation for sweet 
sandwiches. They are split and buttered while hot and filled 
with honey and almonds, cream cheese and jam, or chopped 
nuts and marmalade. They are best served warm. 

Filling for Nut Sandwiches 

Pignolias or pine nuts, butternuts, walnuts, hickory nuts, 
almonds and pecans may all be put through a meat-chopper, 
mixed, a very little salt added, and spread over thin, buttered 
slices of brown or white bread. Or, to the ground nuts may be 
added a little salt and paprika and either salad oil or creamed 
butter to make a smooth paste. 

The salty taste of peanut butter is good with raisin bread. 
Peanuts may be rubbed to a paste with creamed butter and a 
layer of chopped preserved ginger added. 

Butternuts, walnuts, hickory nuts, almonds, or pecans may 
be used in equal parts, ground fine, with cream cheese moistened 
with sweet thick cream and seasoned with salt. Grated Ameri- 
can cheese may be used instead of cream cheese and melted 
butter instead of cream. 

PETITE MARMITE 

Yeast bouillon, on the market as cubes or paste, makes an 
excellent spread for sandwiches, hors d'oeuvres and appetizers. 
It may be used alone or mixed with butter or other pastes. Its 
strong flavor makes it especially desirable with milder flavored 
fillings.

HOT SANDWICHES 

The hot sandwich is now frequently used as a supper or 
luncheon dish with a salad. It is sometimes served as a break- 
fast dish and even a dessert may now be served in sandwich 
form, as, for instance^ slices of ice-cream between slices of 
sponge cake. 

There are several types of hot sandwiches. Some are made 
from plain bread and served with hot sauce; in others the 
framework of the sandwich is toast, sauted slices of bread, 
French-fried toast or fresh slices of bread baked with the sand- 
wich-filling; and in still others hot baking-powder biscuit or 
crisp toasted crackers are used. 

Then besides the regulation kind of sandwich — a filling be- 
tween two slices of breadstuff — there is the open-faced kind, 
in which the top slice is left oflf and a garnish of cut parsley, 



152 

pickle, olive or grated cheese is used instead of the covering 
slice. 

And, lastly, there is a third and novel type of sandwich in 
which the outer structure is of meat. This is cut in thin slices, 
dipped in fritter batter and fried in fat, and a filling of vege- 
tables is placed between the slices. 

GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES 

Between two slices of medium thick bread, lay slices of cheese 
cut about one-eighth inch thick. Place in oven until cheese 
begins to melt. Then toast on both sides and serve hot. Or

boiled ham. Lay the ham in French dressing for a few minutes. 
Drain and dip in a plain fritter batter. Fry in deep fat and 
drain on soft paper. Place one of the slices of ham on a hot 
plate, add lettuce and cover with another slice of the fried 
ham. Pour orange-raisin sauce over the sandwich and serve 
at once. 

HOT BISCUIT SANDWICH 

Make plain baking-powder biscuits. Bake until the crust Is 
crisp on both top and bottom. Break — do not cut — the biscuits 
apart and butter the halves. On one side place a thick slice 
of tomato, then a layer of mayonnaise dressing and then one of 
minced bacon. Cover with the other half of the biscuit, press 
lightly together and serve at once. 

SAVORY SANDWICHES 

Spread slices of whole-wheat or graham toast with butter. 
Over these place slices of crisply cooked bacon. Sprinkle 
generously with chopped pickle and horseradish. Serve with 
sliced tomatoes.

SARDINE AND TOAST SANDWICHES 

1 cup sardines Mayonnaise 

Lettuce Lemon-juice 

Onlon-julce Graham bread 

Sardines that have been prepared in oil are to be preferred 
for these sandwiches. Drain the sardines, tear them in pieces, 
add a few drops of lemon-juice, onion-juice and enough mayon- 
naise to moisten. Toast medium-thin slices of graham bread, 
and spread with butter creamed with a few drops of lemon- 
juice. Cover with lettuce and add the sardines and another 
slice of toast. Serve with a garnish of lemon. 

CHEESE AND TOMATO SANDWICHES 

6 slices bread 6 slices bacon 

6 slices tomato Grated cheese 

Butter the slices of bread. On each slice, place a slice of to- 
mato, cover with grated cheese, and add a slice of bacon. Toast 
under the flame of a broiler until the bacon is crisp. 

HAM OR BACON AND CHEESE SANDWICHES 

Butter slices of toasted bread. Cover with a thin slice of 
boiled ham or bacon, spread with mustard, and cover with a 
layer of thinly sliced or grated cheese. Place the slices in the 
oven until the cheese is melted. Garnish with minced parsley 
and serve at once. 

PEANUT AND CHILI SANDWICHES 

Mix peanut butter with chili sauce to form a paste. Spread 
slices of hot brown bread or toasted graham bread with butter, 
add the mixture and put the slices together with crisp lettuce 
leaves between. Garnish with slices of dill pickle. 

DEVILED TOMATO SANDWICHES 

6 tomatoes Pepper 

1 cup bread crumbs 1 cup ground boiled ham 

4 slices bacon 1 tablespoon French mustard 

Salt 6 slices bread 

Cut a slice from the stem end of each tomato. Sprinkle with 
salt, pepper and bits of bacon. Bake until the tomatoes are 



SANDWICHES 155 

tender. Serve on slices of hot buttered toast spread with the 
ground ham mixed with the mustard. 

Suggestions for Breakfast Sandwiches 

Poached egg on toast is an open-faced sandwich. Rolls split, 
toasted, and buttered, with broiled tender bacon placed between 
them, or bacon between crisply toasted slices of well buttered 
corn bread are other forms of breakfast sandwiches. 

Creamed oysters on toast, scrambled eggs on buttered toast 
spread with anchovy paste, creamed codfish between two slices 
of buttered toast are all in the breakfast category of sandwiches. 
To make a variation of French toast that takes it out of the 
sweet and puts it into the meat class, spread buttered slices of 
bread with deviled ham, put the slices together in twos, dip them 
into a mixture of egg and milk in proportion of two eggs to one 
cup of milk, and then saute the slices in butter until they are 
nicely brown on both sides. 

Old fashioned country sausage may be cut in thin rounds, 
fried a delicate brown and served between hot, savory pancakes 
of the same size as the sausage slices. 

Suggestions for Hot Sandwiches 

Hot sandwiches should be substantial and filling without 
losing the chief characteristic of all sandwiches — ease in han- 
dling. For this reason rolls and buns are often more satisfactory 
than sliced bread or toast. 

Broiled Hamburger steaks on round rolls are always popular. 
The meat mixture may be varied by rolling a stuffed olive in 
each; by adding strips of bacon crosswise after the first turning, 
or by a slice of Bermuda onion on both sides. Chopped pickles, 
carrots, celery or radishes may be added to the meat before 
broiling. 

1. Broiled pineapple with sliced hot chicken, hot turkey or 
hot duck, on whole wheat bread. 2. Broiled ham with a slice o£ 
pineapple, either fresh or canned, served on white toast. 3 . Sliced 
roast lamb with grilled fresh pineapple on toasted English muf- 
fins. 4. Sliced hard-cooked egg with hot anchovy sauce on Bos- 
ton brown bread. 5. Hot roast veal with anchovy sauce and 
grilled tomato on rye roll. 6. Grilled tomato with Cheddar cheese 
on rye toast. 7. Hot smoked tongue with fried apples on toasted 
English muffins. 8. Hot corned beef with grilled sweet potato 
and endive on finger rolls. 



TOAST 



BREAD for toast should be cut in slices from one -eighth 
to one-half inch thick and toasted over a clear fire or in 
a gas or electric toaster until both sides are an even, rich golden 
brown. Unless a toaster with an automatic timing and turning 
device is used, the slices should be turned two or three times 
to avoid warping. 

CRISP DRY TOAST 

Cut the crust from stale bread. Slice the bread as thin as 
a wafer, dry it on a pan lined with paper, in the oven, leaving 
the door open. When it is entirely dry, close the oven door 
and brown slightly. 

TOAST MELBA 

Cut bread in one-eighth-inch slices and toast until it is crisp. 

BUTTERED TOAST 

Toast bread until crisp and a rich brown on both sides. But- 
ter while hot and serve at once. 

WATER TOAST 

Toast bread until crisp and brown. Pour into a soup-plate 
one cup boiling water and one teaspoon salt. Dip the toast 
into this water and remove at once. Spread lightly with butter 
and serve immediately. 

MILK TOAST 

No. 1 

Toast bread, butter it well, sprinkle with salt and pour scalded 
milk over it. 

No. 2 

6 slices buttered toast 2 tablespoons butter 

2 tablespoons flour 2 cups milk

12 slices bread Yz inch thick Y2 teaspoon salt 

3 eggs 2 cups milk 

Beat the eggs, add the milk and salt. Dip slices of bread into 
the mixture and saute in a little hot fat until a delicate brown 
on both sides. Serve hot. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or 
serve maple sirup with the toast. 

CINNAMON TOAST 

Spread hot toast with butter and sprinkle generously with a 
mixture of sugar and cinnamon. Place on the top shelf of the 
oven or under the broiler just long enough to melt the sugar. 



TOASTED LOAF AND CORNUCOPIA 

Remove all but the bottom crust from loaf of bread. Cut 
through center, lengthwise, then into equal sections crosswise. 
Brush with melted butter and brown in 375° oven. 

Cornucopia — Remove crusts from sliced bread, lay thick 
cheese strip diagonally, fold bread to opposite corners, fasten

APPETIZERS 



STRICT convention in England and America at one time 
decreed that the formal dinner should begin with soup, 
but that custom is no longer binding even in the most formal 
household. Other dishes to introduce the meal have crept in 
and because of their savory qualities have found ready and 
general acceptance. Appetizers, they are usually called. Some- 
times they are referred to as relishes or as hors d'oeuvres, because 
they are often a glorified edition of the old side dish now given 
a conspicuous place as a separate course by itself. 

Characteristics of the Appetizer 

The appetizer must have distinct, piquant flavor and appetite- 
whetting qualities. Pickled and salted foods, acids, pepper and 
paprika play a conspicuous part in their manufacture. Raw 
oysters and clams, grapefruit, melons and fruit cocktails, 
canapes and small sandwiches spread with pastes of sardines, 
anchovies and caviar, lobster and crabmeat, pate de foie gras, 
cheese, olives and other mixtures of high flavor, deviled eggs, 
small succulent salads, may all be included without prejudice 
in the list of appetizers. In parts of the United States, the 
dinner is always begun with the salad as the appetizer. 

Serving the Appetizer 

The appetizer should always be served in small portions be- 
cause the purpose of this course is to whet but not to satisfy 
the appetite. 

At formal dinners and luncheons, the same kind of appetizer 
is generally served to all the guests, but at more informal meals 
the hostess may give her guests an opportunity to choose their 
own appetizers. In that case a number of portions of various 
kinds are arranged on a regulation hors d'oeuvre tray or on a 
chop plate or small platter which is passed to each guest. 

Each portion must be arranged so that it may be lifted from 
the tray by the guest and transferred to his plate without 
trouble. Suitable service silver — usually a tablespoon and large 
folk— must be laid on each tray. 

158 



APPETIZERS 159 

The following combination will serve as a suggestion for the 
arrangement of a tray: 

1. A crab salad. 2. An onion and green pepper salad. 3. Three or 
four olives on a small lettuce leaf. 4. A sandwich made of cress and 
brown bread and butter. 5. An oblong or square of aspic jelly on a 
lettuce leaf with an anchovy or sardine on the jelly. 6. Half of a. 
deviled egg on a lettuce leaf or in a bed of cress. 7. Cream cheese balls 
rolled in chopped chipped beef. 8. Cream cheese balls rolled in caviar. 
9. Large stuffed olives filled with sharp cheese, wrapped in bacon and 
broiled until bacon is crisp. 10. Center celery stalks stuffed with Roque- 
fort cheese paste or anchovy paste. 11. Small sweet pickles rolled in 
cream cheese then in a strip of smoked salmon, fastened with toothpick. 
12. Rolled anchovies in broiled mushrooms. 13- Caviar in broiled 
mushrooms. 14. Tiny meat balls in broiled mushrooms. 15. Chicken 
liver balls rolled in chopped chipped beef. 

Shell Fish 

Oysters or clams on the half-shell, oyster, clam, lobster or 
crab cocktails may be used as the appetizer. The recipes are 
given in the chapter on "Fish." 



Canapes 

PREPARED BREAD FOR ALL CANAPES 

Canapes are made from stale white bread, cut in quarter- 
inch slices and then shaped with a cutter into circles two and 
one-half or three inches in diameter or cut into squares, strips, 
triangles or other fancy shapes. These portions of bread may 
then be fried in deep fat and drained on absorbent paper, or 
sauted in just enough fat to keep them from burning, or toasted 
or set in the oven until they turn a delicate brown. When 
•finished they should be nicely browned on both sides. They are 
then ready to be covered with the mixture preferred. 

ANCHOVY CANAPES 

6 portions prepared bread 3 teaspoons lemon-juice 

3 tablespoons anchovy paste 2 hard-cooked eggs 

Whole anchovies for garnish (may be omitted) 

Anchovy paste, which comes in tubes, jars or bottles, may 
be utilized, or whole anchovies may be reduced to a smooth 



( 



i6o 

paste with a wooden spoon. Season with lemon- juice and 
spread the paste on the prepared pieces of bread. Split anchovy 
lengthwise and lay the halves diagonally across the canape, mark- 
ing the point where they cross by a little pyramid of riced yolk 
of hard-cooked eggs. Petal-shaped pieces of the hard-cooked 
white may radiate from this center pyramid. A large anchovy 
curved around a circle of hard-cooked egg in the center of a 
canape is also effective. The anchovies may be omitted from 
the garnish. 

SARDINE OR LOBSTER OR OTHER SEA FOOD 
CANAPES 

6 portions prepared bread Salt 

6 large sardines or Worcestershire sauce 

6 tablespoons lobster or other Pickled beets 

sea food, chopped fine 6 large olives 

Juice of 1 lemon 24 thin slices lemon 

Remove skin and backbone and flake the sardines with a fork. 
Or chop cooked lobster meat very fine. Season with lemon- 
juice, salt and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Spread 
the prepared bread with the mixture and decorate by placing 
in the center of each canape a small circle of pickled beet. Cut 
a slice from the end of a large olive so that it will stand firmly 
and place this in the center of the beet. A narrow border o£ 
minced beet may be placed around the edge of the canape 
with good effect. Garnish the plate with four thin slices o£ 
lemon placed symmetrically. 

Crab meat, shrimps or any smoked or canned fish, highly 
seasoned and attractively garnished, may be utilized for canapes 
instead of the sardines or lobster meat. 

CAVIAR CANAPES 

6 portions prepared bread 3 tablespoons white onion 

3 tablespoons caviar chopped fine 

Garnish of green pepper or hard-cooked egg 

Caviar, which is the salted roe of the sturgeon, is highly 
esteemed by epicures as an appetizer. It is usually served with 
minced raw onion and decorated with hard-cooked egg and 
minced pickles. A favorite arrangement is to have an oblong 
canape two by four inches, one half covered with the minced 



APPETIZERS i6i 

raw onion and the other half with the caviar. The striking 
difference in the colors is very effective. A sliver of green pep- 
per may lie just where the two mixtures meet and little points 
of the green pepper extend out on each side, or a circle of the 
white of hard-cooked egg may decorate the center of the half 
covered with caviar and a little mound of the riced yolk orna- 
ment the section covered by the chopped onion. 



CHEESE AND OLIVE CANAPES 

6 portions prepared bread Garnish of red pepper or 

3 tablespoons cream cheese pickled beet 

Olives stuffed with pimientos 

Spread on the prepared bread a paste made by mixing equal 
proportions of cream cheese and chopped stuffed olives. Garnish 
with a quarter-inch border of the chopped olives and a star of 
red pepper or pickled beet in the center of each canape. 



PATE DE FOIE GRAS CANAPES 

6 portions prepared bread % cup cream 

3 tablespoons pate de foie Cayenne pepper 

gras paste or imitation pate Salt 

de foie gras Parsley 

Add the cream and seasoning to the paste. Rub through a 
fine sieve and spread on portions of fried bread. Garnish with 
parsley. 

Imitation Pate de Foie Gras 

Yz cup chicken livers ^ onion,* chopped 

2 tablespoons chicken fat or Salt and pepper 

butter Mustard or celery salt 

Carefully clean, cook and chop chicken livers and mash them 
to a paste with a wooden spoon. Chop the onion fine and fry 
in the fat till yellowed. Place the livers, the fat and the onion 
in a cup, mix well and season with pepper and salt, and either 
mustard or celery salt, according to taste. Place at once on ice. 
This preparation makes excellent sandwiches.

Suggestions for Mixtures to Be Used in Making 
Canapes 

1. Anchovy paste mixed with lemon- juice. 

2. Shredded tuna fish mixed with lemon- juice and mayon- 
naise. 

3. Chopped lobster meat mixed with cream and seasoned 
with salt, pepper and lemon-juice. 

4. Cream cheese and chopped stufifed olives. 

5. Minced red and green peppers mixed with mayonnaise 
and seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon-juice. 

6. Sardine paste mixed with lemon- juice, salt and Worcester- 
shire sauce. 

7. A layer of anchovy paste covered with a paste of shredded 
crab meat, cream cheese and butter, seasoned with salt and 
pepper. 

8. Devilled ham mixed with chopped hard-cooked egg and 
horseradish. 

Fruit Appetizers 

Fruit cocktails may be made from mixtures of almost any 
fruits, canned or fresh. As a rule, combinations of a sweet 
and a sour fruit are most piquant in flavor. All fruit appetizers 
should be thoroughly chilled. The trays of the mechanical 
refrigerator are excellent for this purpose. 

GRAPEFRUIT COCKTAILS 

No. 1 — Grapefruit on the Half Shell. 

Cut grapefruit in half, crosswise. With a pair of sharp 
shears or with a grapefruit corer, cut a circular piece from the 
center of each half, being careful not to cut through the skin. 
Then with a sharp knife loosen each section from the mem- 
brane and skin. Sprinkle with sugar and set in the refrigerator 
to chill. Pink the edges of the skin if you prefer, and remove 
the pieces of membrane between the sections of fruit if you 
have time. In this way the shell is left with only edible portions 
of the fruit. In any case each mouthful of fruit should be en- 
tirely detached from the shell. Serve a half grapefruit on a 
plate or in a special grapefruit glass, embedded in ice. 



APPETIZERS 163 

No. 2 — Grapefruit and Orange Cocktail. 
1 cup diced grapefruit pulp Sugar 

1 cup diced orange pulp Lemon-juice or grape-juice 

Maraschino cherries or preserved pineapple 

Mix the orange and grapefruit pulp. Sprinkle with sugar 
and a little lemon-juice or grape-juice. Chill, and have glasses 
chilled so that the whole, when served, may be very cold. At 
the last moment fill the glasses with the fruit mixture, garnish- 
ing with cherries or preserved pineapple. 

No. 3 — Grapefruit and Strawberry Cocktail. 

3 grapefruit 1 pint strawberries 

Sugar 

Cut the grapefruit in half and carefully remove the pulp, 
leaving the inner white skin as lining. Place the shells in cold 
water to keep them firm. Mix the grapefruit pulp with the 
strawberries and sprinkle with sugar. Chill. At serving time, 
fill the shells with the mixture placing large handsome berries 
on top as garnish. The mixed fruit left over may be served 
at breakfast or used as a sauce for pudding or ice-cream. 

STRAWBERRY AND PINEAPPLE COCKTAIL 

1 cup orange-juice Sugar 

y2, cup lemon-juice 1 cup strawberries 

1 cup diced pineapple 

Combine the orange- and lemon- juice sweetened to taste, 
keeping the mixture rather tart. Chill. Wash and drain the 
strawberries and hull them. At serving time cut the berries 
in half (except six large ones), mix with the pineapple, place 
in glasses and cover with the fruit- juice. One large, perfect 
berry set on a tiny circle of pineapple may decorate the top 
of each cocktail. 

ORANGE MINT COCKTAIL 

6 small, rather sour oranges 3 tablespoons lemon-juice or 

Powdered sugar 3 tablespoons pineapple-juice 

Fresh mint 2 tablespoons sugar 

Separate the orange into sections and remove the thin skin 
with a pair of scissors. Chill thoroughly, place in glasses, 
sprinkle with powdered sugar and add the lemon -juice mixed 



1 64 

with pineapple-juice or sugar. Sprinkle with chopped mint 
and garnish with an upright sprig of mint in the center of the 
glass. 

WATERMELON COCKTAIL 

2 cups watermelon balls Powdered sugar 

Fresh mint 2 tablespoons lemon-juice 

(Lemon- juice and sugar may be omitted) 

"With a vegetable-cutter prepare small balls of bright pink 
watermelon. Sprinkle lightly with sugar and add lemon- juice. 
Chill thoroughly. Fill glasses. Garnish with sprigs of fresh 
mint. A pretty fancy is to moisten the edge of each cocktail 
glass and invert in chopped mint before filling. This will leave 
a line of green adhering to the edge of the glass. The glass may 
be lined with sprigs of mint before the watermelon is put in. 

CHERRY COCKTAIL 

1 pound cherries 6 tablespoons strawberry-juice 

Yz cup chopped almonds 6 tablespoons powdered sugar 

3 teaspoons lemon- juice 

Pit the cherries, sprinkle with chopped almonds and pour 
over them a sirup made by mixing strawberry- juice with 
powdered sugar and lemon- juice. Chill and serve ice-cold in 
cocktail glasses. Decorate the plate with two or three whole 
cherries and a leaf or two. 

MIXED FRUIT COCKTAIL 

6 large oranges Juice of 1 lemon 

1 banana Sugar 

2 slices pineapple 

Slice oflF the tops of the oranges and scoop out the inside, 
being careful not to break the inside white skin of the orange- 
peel. Put the orange cups into a bowl of ice-water. Cut in 
small pieces the banana and pineapple, mix these with the 
orange pulp cut in small pieces, add the lemon- juice, sweeten 
to taste, and fill the orange shells. Set each one in a small bowl, 
filled with crushed ice. 

The mixed fruit pulp that remains after the orange skins 
have been filled may be kept in the refrigerator and served as 
sauce with ice-cream or used in any other way that circum- 
stances suggest.

SOUPS 



SOUPS may be roughly divided into two groups. In the 
first group belong the soups that are always made from 
meat stock. These are the various modifications of brown 
and white stocks, bouillons, consommes and broths. In the 
second group belong the soups that may be made either with 
or without meat stock. These are the various modifications of 
cream soups, purees and bisques, of chowders and stews and of 
vegetable soups. 

The Value of Soup in the Dietary 

The purpose of soup in the meal is two-fold ; first, to improve 
digestion and stimulate appetite by introducing at the beginning 
of the meal a highly flavored liquid food which increases the 
flow of digestive juices; second, to increase the variety of nu- 
trients in the meal, or even to furnish the main dish of the meal. 
Stock soups are chiefly valuable for the first purpose. Cream 
soups, purees, bisques, chowders and stews are more valuable 
for the second purpose. 

A heavy meal should begin with an un thickened stock soup; 
a light meal may well begin with one of the cream variety. 

Home Made and Ready to Use Soups 

Not so long ago, all soups were made at home, and the stock 
pot was kept on the stove day in and day out; but with the 
gradual change from coal to gas and electricity as fuels, and 
with the perfecting of modern commercial canning and con- 
densing methods, the long slow process of stock making has 
become less common in home kitchens. 

However, in soup many valuable food materials that would 
otherwise be thrown out may be saved for the nourishment 
of the family, and some knowledge of the principles of soup 
making is worth while for every housekeeper. A home made 
soup which is lacking in strength or flavor may be easily im- 
proved by the addition of a can of soup or some of the various 
meat extracts obtainable. 

165 



i66 

For the small family, the canned soups are almost indispen- 
sable, and in the making of sauces and gravies, where only a 
small amount of stock is required, a can of soup supplies the 
required foundation at a minimum of trouble and expense. 

Making Soup Stock 

Cut Meat in Small Pieces and saw or crack bone. This 
is done to increase the surface exposed to the action of hot 
water. 

Brown From One-fourth to One-half the Meat for 
brown stocks and consommes. This gives added color and im- 
proves flavor. 

Soak the Meat and Bone in Cold Water for thirty 
minutes or more before cooking. This helps to extract the 
juices of the meat. 

Heat Gradually to the Simmering-point (190° -2 10° 
F.). If stock is to be used for bouillon or consomme or any 
clear soup, skim at this time. Continue to simmer for three 
or four hours to insure as complete extraction as possible of 
the juices and flavor of meat. If the mixture boils, it is not 
so fine in flavor. 

Add the Spices, Herbs, and Vegetables, and continue 
simmering from one-half hour to one hour. The seasonings 
are added at this time rather than earlier to prevent the dis- 
agreeable flavor of over-cooked vegetables. 

Strain the Soup Into a Large Bowl or other container. 
If the stock is to be used for clear soups, place several thicknesses 
of cheese-cloth over the strainer before pouring the mixture 
through it. 

Cool the Stock Quickly, because quick cooling improves 
the keeping quality of the soup. Soup should, if possible, al- 
ways be allowed to become thoroughly cold before being 
used, since the fat hardens and collects in a cake on top and can 
be removed easily. Do not remove fat from the top of soup 
stock until the stock is to be used. It protects the stock against 
spoilage. 

Keep Stock in a Cold Place, as it spoils quickly if it is not 
kept chilled. Spoiled stock, like spoiled meat, is dangerous food. 



SOUPS 167 



Using Soup Stock 

Wlien ready to use stock, loosen fat around the edges with 
the thin blade of a knife. Remove the cake of fat. If the 
stock is jellied, wipe off the remaining small pieces of fat and 
the edge of the bowl with a cloth wrung out in hot water. If 
the stock is very soft or liquid, pass small sheets of absorbent 
paper over the top of the stock. 

When Stock Must Be Used Before Cooling, skim off all 
the fat possible. Most of the remainder of the fat may be 
removed in one of two ways. The first way is to pass over the 
top small sheets of absorbent paper or blotting-paper. The 
second way is to cool the soup as much as possible beforehand, 
then to wrap a piece of ice in a cloth and let it down into the 
stock. Move the ice around just below the surface so that the 
fat on the surface is suddenly chilled, and it will gather on the 
cloth around the ice. This must be done quickly to prevent 
unnecessary dilution of the stock. 

For Clear Soups, take the stock from the top of the bowl, 
being careful to avoid any sediment which may have escaped 
through the sieve and settled to the bottom of the bowl. This 
sediment is valuable as a food and should be reserved for gravies 
or soups which are not necessarily clear. Clarify this stock if 
a translucent, sparkling soup is desired. 

To Clarify Soup — Allow one egg-white and shell to one 
quart of stock. Crush the shell into small pieces and mix with 
the slightly beaten egg-white. Heat the stock just enough to 
liquefy it, if it is jellied. Thoroughly stir the egg-white and 
shell into the stock. Heat to the boiling-point, stirring con- 
stantly, then boil without stirring two to five minutes. Add a 
cup of cold water and set on back of stove to settle. Strain 
through two thicknesses of cheese-cloth. The purpose of egg 
in clarifying soup is the same as in coffee. The coagulated egg 
gathers around itself the particles of solid substance in the soup, 
which otherwise would be fine enough to pass through a strainer.

1 tablespoon, each, of carrot, 

onion, celery, turnip 
1 teaspoon salt 



A good stock can be made by using left-over meat scraps 
and bones instead of the beef specified, and by substituting any 
available vegetables, such as the outer leaves of lettuce, celery 
tops, etc., for those given above. After the stock is made, left- 
over vegetables, cereals, hard-cooked eggs, small pieces of meat, 
etc., may be diced or chopped and served in the soup.

2 peppercorns celery, onion 

Fish stock needs to be cooked for only half the time required 
for other stock. 



VARIATIONS OF BROWN OR WHITE SOUP STOCK 

Vegetable Soup — If a clear soup is desired, follow the direc- 
tions for clarifying soup stock, and then add, to each quart of 
brown stock, one cup of diced vegetables, raw or cooked. If 
the vegetables are cooked, the soup needs to be boiled for only 
a few minutes. When raw vegetables are added, simmer until 
the vegetables are all tender, adding boiling water, if necessary, 
to replace any that may have evaporated. Season to taste and 
serve. 

Sago, Rice or Barley Soup — ^For each quart of brown or 
white stock, use two tablespoons sago, rice or barley. Soak sago 
or rice one-half hour in enough stock or water to cover it. 
Barley should be soaked over night. Bring remainder of stock 
to simmering-point. Add soaked sago, barley, or rice and sim- 
mer in closed saucepan one-half hour. 

Macaroni, Vermicelli, Spaghetti, or Noodle Soup — ^For 
each quart brown stock, use 54 cup macaroni, spaghetti, vermi- 
celli or noodles broken into small pieces. Simmer the pastes in 
the stock until tender, adding water if necessary. 

VARIATIONS OF CONSOMME 

Consomme Princesse — Consomme served with shreds or 
small dice of cooked chicken and green peas. 

Consomme a la Royale — Consomme served with tiny 
blocks of royal custard. 

Consomme Julienne or Julienne Soup — Consomme 
served with carrot, onions, turnips and celery cut into shreds 
about as thick as a match. 

The vegetables should be boiled in clear water before being 
added to the consomme.

Unthlckened Soups 

Soups suitable for serving as the first course of a meal with 
a substantial main course are found in this group. Any of the 
variations of soup stock or consomme may be used for this 
purpose. The following recipes give directions for other soups 
of this variety. 

CHICKEN OR TURKEY BONE SOUP 

Never discard the bones of turkey or chicken as they always 
will make a delicious soup. Scrape the meat from the bones, 
break the bones, pack in a kettle, and cover with cold water, 
adding a small onion. Cover closely and simmer very gently 
for three hours. Strain and cool. One-half hour before it is 
to be served, return to the fire and for every quart of stock 
add one cup of the cold meat, season and keep hot till needed. 
This soup may be greatly improved by adding to it, three 
minutes before serving, ten oysters to each quart of soup. 

CLAM BROTH 

12 clams in the shell 2 cups water Paprika 

Purchase large clams in the shells. Scrub them thoroughly 
with a brush, place them in a kettle with cold water, closely 
covered, and bring water to the boiling-point. As soon as the 
shells have opened, remove them from the broth. The clams 
may be served at once, in the half-shell, or taken from the 
shells and kept to be served in any form desired. Let the broth 
settle, strain, being careful not to pour out the sandy sediment, 
reheat, add a little red pepper or paprika, and serve hot. Twelve 
good-sized clams should make enough broth for six persons, 
but if there does not seem to be sufficient, add a little boiling 
water or milk. Clam broth seldom needs added salt. Water 
wafers heated in the oven, or divided crackers toasted on their 
broken surfaces, buttered and heated for a few minutes in the 
oven, are generally served with this broth. 

Clam broth may be served, hot or cold, in cups with a heap- 
ing teaspoon of whipped cream, into which has been beaten a 
little salt and pepper, placed upon the top of each cup. The 
cream adds richness to the flavor of the soup and increases its 
nourishing properties.

for thirty minutes. Add lemon- juice, sugar, and salt. Boil one- 
half hour more. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt. Add the 
hot borscht to this, a little at a time, stirring well to prevent 
the separating of the eggs. This will behave more or less as in 
any soft custard mixture. Serve at once, while very hot. 

BOUILLABAISSE 

This is a famous fish mixture and greatly esteemed by epi- 
cures, but it can not be recommended as economical. It has one 
advantage, however, and that is that if served with celery, 
bread and butter, and a dessert, it would provide the main dish 
for an excellent meal.

CHICKEN SOUP 



This recipe provides a large bowl of substantial soup, as well 
as a cooked fowl, and when the soup is served the rest of the 
dinner should consist of light dishes. For more economical 
recipes see Index for chicken or turkey bone soup, and chicken 
broth for invalids. 

1 fowl (3 to 4 pounds) 1 cup milk 

Yz pound ham 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 

1 onion Salt and pepper 

2 to 3 quarts water 1 tablespoon flour 

54 cup rice . 1 tablespoon chicken fat 

Cut up fowl into quarters, with the ham and onion, and add 
the water. Let this simmer until the meat is very tender, then 
strain, reserving the meat to be used in any way desired. Re- 
move all possible fat, and to one and one-fourth quarts of this 
soup (the remainder can be used for sauce with the meat) add 
well washed rice, chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Simmer

into pieces, and the mint. Stew until the mass is tender. Strain 
through a sieve or coarse cheese-cloth. Thin with stock or 
water, if necessary; bind with a roux of flour and fat and season 
with salt, pepper, and a little sugar. Add the half cup of whole 
peas, stew for a few minutes, and serve, 

SPLIT PEA SOUP 

This recipe provides the main part of a dinner, since the 
ham end will serve as the meat dish. A ham bone, left over 



SOUPS 175

as a piece bought especially for the purpose. 

2 or 3 pounds ham end 3 quarts boiling water 

1 carrot 1 cup split peas 

1 onion Salt and pepper 

2 potatoes 2 tablespoons catchup 

Put the end of a moderately lean smoked ham into a kettle 
with carrot and peeled onion, whole potatoes, and boiling water.

Thick Soups, Chowders and Stews 

Cream Soups 

Cream soups are made by combining a very thin white sauce, 
see page 308, with a suitable quantity of cooked, mashed, 
strained vegetable, fish or meat pulp. Irradiated evaporated milk 
used instead of white sauce will greatly increase the food value 
and when used for making white sauce will increase the flavor. 
Flavor is improved, too, by the use of some highly flavored 
vegetables or the addition of a proportion of soup stock. 

Purees 

Purees are made in the same way as cream soups, but are 
somewhat thicker. They are often served under the name of 
"Cream Soup." 

Bisques 

The name bisque is usually given to a cream soup made from 
fish, and the fish is often diced or mashed through a coarse 
strainer. A familiar example of an exception in the use of 
the word is mock bisque soup, or tomato bisque, as it is often 
called. 

Chowders 

Chowders were probably the common ancestors of the more 
refined cream soups, purees, and bisques. The word chowder 
comes from the French chaudiere, meaning caldron. The 
chowder originated as a community fish stew to which each 
neighbor contributed something; milk, fish, potatoes, crackers, 
pork or some seasoning. These contributions were all cooked 
together in the common caldron, from which chowder derives 
its name, and each contributor withdrew his share of soup when 
it was ready. 

The chowder of today is much the same as the old chowder, 
and consists of pieces of different vegetables or of fish and po- 
tatoes and various seasonings cooked in milk with crackers added 
just before serving. 

Fish Stews 

Fish stews are made of milk and the juice of the fish which 
gives flavor to the soup. They differ from the cream soups in 



SOUPS 177 

that they need not be thickened, though they often are, and 
from the chowders in being less complex in composition. 

Binding Thick Soups 

When a vegetable, meat or fish pulp is combined with milk 
or stock in making soups, they separate and the solid substance 
sinks to the bottom of the liquid. Some flour or corn-starch 
cooked into the mixture will overcome this. With many of 
these soups the reason for using the flour or corn-starch may 
not necessarily be to thicken a soup which the vegetable, meat 
or fish pulp has already made thick enough, but to blend the 
liquid with the solid so that all parts of the soup will have the 
same consistency. 

Flour or corn-starch may be mixed with enough cold liquid 
— ^milk, water, or stock — to make a creamy thickness and added 
carefully to the soup; or it may be combined with the soup 
by means of a roux (see Index) . When a colored roux is de- 
sired the fat is browned before the flour is added and the mix- 
ture is cooked to a reddish brown color. When a roux is made 
in this way, the liquid is usually added to it gradually. 

Preventing Skin on Cream Soups 

A cream or milk soup has a tendency to form a skin on the 
top as it cools. If it is beaten just before it is served, the froth 
protects it against skin formation. 

A spoonful of whipped cream or beaten egg-white served 
on top of each portion of cream soup aids in preventing the skin 
formation and adds to the delicacy and attractiveness of the 
dish.

refrigerator are excellent for this purpose. These fruit purees 
are really as closely related to the appetizers as to the soups.

1 pint oysters Sak, pepper, paprika 

4 tablespoons butter 1 quart rich milk 

Put cleaned oysters, strained oyster liquor, butter and season- 
ing into a saucepan and simmer gently until oysters begin to 
curl at the edges. At the same time, heat the milk, being care- 
ful not to scorch it. Add the hot milk to the oysters and oyster 
liquor and serve at once. 

Thickened — To the ingredients given above, add from four 
to eight tablespoons of flour, and, if desired, a little onion-juice 
and mace. Scald the oysters in their own liquor. Make a white 
sauce of the milk, flour and butter and season as desired. Com- 
bine the scalded oysters and oyster liquor with the white sauce 
and serve at once. 

YEAST BOUILLON 

In recent years several varieties of autolyzed yeast have ap- 
peared on the market to be used as bouillon or in sandwich 
pastes. They have the flavor of strong meat extract but have 
the advantage of being of pure vegetable origin. If purchased 
in jars use according to direction. When in cubes use like any 
other bouillon cube. Of peculiar value for the high content of 
vitamins B and G, it is also called petite marmite. 



SOUP ACCESSORIES 



SOUP may be served with many accompaniments, such as 
crisped crackers, cheese-sticks and pulled bread; and va- 
rieties of croutons, forcemeat balls, noodles, and vegetable 
pastes may be placed in the soup itself. Grated Parmesan 
cheese is passed with many kinds of soup to be sprinkled on 
each portion. 

Recipes for some of the best-liked accompaniments for soup 
are given below. 

CROUTONS 

Cut stale bread into slices about one-third of an inch thick, 
and remove all crust. Spread with butter, cut in cubes and 
bake in the oven until delicately browned. If preferred, these 
cubes of bread may be fried in deep fat or sauted in just enough 
fat to keep them from burning. Put into soup at time of serv- 
ing, or pass in a separate dish, permitting each person to put as 
many croutons as he may wish in his portion of soup. 

MOCK ALMONDS 

These are merely croutons shaped to represent almonds. 

CHEESE STICKS AND ROLLS 

Cut bread in long, narrow strips, spread with butter, then 
with a thick coating of grated cheese. Brown in moderate oven 
(350° F.). Or cut crust from sliced bread, spread thickly with 
paste of grated cheese and butter, roll, fasten with toothpick 
and brown as above. 

HOT CRISPED CRACKERS 

Toast thin wafers or crackers for three minutes in a hot oven 
(400° -42 5° F.). They are better if spread with a thin film 
of butter before being put into the oven. If Boston crackers 
are preferred, split them, arrange the halves, rough side up, on 
a plate, lay a bit of butter on each, and brown them in the 
oven.

VARIATIONS 

Use the cookie cutters in any small design to cut sliced bread 
for toasting on a cookie sheet or large pan. Or use the cutters 
on biscuit dough and bake or fry in deep fat, 

NOODLES 

1 egg Yz teaspoon salt Flour 

Stir sufficient flour into a slightly beaten egg to make a very 
stiff dough. Add salt, knead, and roll as thin as possible. It 
should be of almost paperlike thinness. Cover with a towel 
and let remain untouched for half an hour. Then cut in small 
fancy shapes, and dry them. When needed, place in boiling 
water and cook rapidly for fifteen minutes. This dough may 
also be rolled into threads and used like macaroni in soup. 

Noodle Balls — Roll the noodle paste as directed above, 
fold it double and with a tin cutter make circles about one- 
fourth inch in diameter. Toss these balls into hot fat, (360°- 
370° F.) using a wire frying-basket. In about a minute they 
will turn a delicate brown and puff into balls. Drain on soft 
paper and serve with soup. As these soften quickly, it is better 
not to put them in the tureen, but to pass them after the soup 
has been served. 

EGG BALLS 

No. 1. 

5 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 

Yz teaspoon pepper Flour 

Simmer four of the eggs in the shell twenty minutes and 
mash the yolks to a smooth paste in a bowl; then add the salt 
and pepper and the other egg, well beaten. Shape the mass into 
tiny balls, roll them in flour and saute, tossing them about while 
frying to prevent their sticking to the pan. They may be made 
some time before needed. Use the hard-cooked egg-whites for 
a sandwich or a salad. 

No. 2. 

Mash the four cooked yolks to a paste, season, and mix with 
the uncooked egg-yolk. Form into small balls. Roll them in 
the uncooked egg-white, then in flour, and poach in hot water. 
These are attractive in consomme.

MARROW AND LIVER BALLS 

2 tablespoons melted marrow Salt and pepper 

1 egg Paprika 

y2 cup soft bread-crumbs l/g teaspoon onion juice 

Strain melted marrow through cheese-cloth, beat until creamy 
and then add beaten egg. Season with salt, pepper and paprika, 
add a little moist bread, and form into balls. Poach in boiling 
water. Use 1 cup chopped liver instead of marrow for liver balls. 

PATE A CHOUX 

1 teaspoon butter 1 egg 
lYz teaspoons milk Salt 
^ cup flour 

Heat butter and milk together. When at the boiUng-point, 
add the flour and a pinch of salt, stirring constantly. Remove 
from the fire, beat in the unbeaten egg, and continue beating 
until the egg is well mixed with the other ingredients. When 
cool, drop small pieces from the tip of a teaspoon into deep, 
boiling fat. When brown and crisp, drain on absorbent paper. 
If desired, two tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese may be 
added to this recipe. 

CUSTARD FOR GARNISHING 

Allow two tablespoons of milk, cream, or consomme to each 
egg. Mix well, season with salt and pepper, and pour into a 
buttered mold, making the custard one-half inch thick. Set 
the mold in a pan containing hot water and place in a slow oven 
(300°-350° F.). When the custard is set, remove from the 
oven and cool. Cut it into small pieces or fancy shapes. The 
egg-white, the egg-yolk or the whole egg may be used in mak- 
ing this custard. 

Custard Roy ale. 

2 egg-yolks Salt and pepper 
1 egg Cayenne 

Yz cup beef stock 

Beat the yolks of the eggs slightly and then beat into them 
the one whole egg. Add beef stock, a little salt, pepper and a 



SOUP ACCESSORIES 189 

few grains of cayenne. Pour the mixture into a shallow pan 
or dish, so that the custard will be about one-half inch deep. 
Set this pan into another holding water that is just below the 
boiling-point and place both in a slow oven (300° -3 50° F.). 
The custard should set without bubbling and without forming 
a brown crust on top. When cold, cut in fancy shapes with 
vegetable-cutter. Use care in placing these in the soup, so that 
they may not break. When used in consomme, they give the 
name *'Consomme Royale" to the soup. 

CHICKEN FORCEMEAT 

White — 

2 breasts chicken (uncooked) 1 cup milk 

Yz teaspoon salt Yz blade mace 

1 cup dry bread-crumbs ^ teaspoon pepper 

3 tablespoons butter 2 egg-whites 

Chop, pound and rub through a puree-sieve, the uncooked 
breasts of chicken. There should be a full half-pint of meat. 
Add salt and pepper. Boil together the bread-crumbs (no 
crusts), milk and mace for ten minutes, or until cooked to a 
smooth paste. Remove from the fire, put in butter and then 
add the seasoned meat and the well-beaten whites of eggs. Stir 
until all ingredients are thoroughly blended. 

Dark — Use dark meat instead of light and the yolks of the 
eggs instead of whites. Chicken livers, also, may be used for 
forcemeat. 

FISH FORCEMEAT 

Free any kind of delicate fish from skin, fat and bone. 
Pound, strain, use one-half pint fish and proceed as for chicken 
forcemeat. 

OYSTER FORCEMEAT 

12 oysters Cayenne 

2 cups dry bread-crumbs 1 teaspoon parsley 

3 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon lemon-juice 

2 egg-yolks 3 tablespoons oyster-juice 

1 teaspoon salt Nutmeg 

Chop the oysters fine and add the bread-crumbs, butter, salt, 
cayenne, minced parsley, lemon- juice, oyster- juice,^ the yolks 
of raw eggs and a grating of nutmeg. Pound to a smooth 



190 

paste and rub through a puree-sieve. Add more salt if neces- 
sary. This is a fine forcemeat for timbales, or for stuffing 
poiiltry or fish. For use in soups, it may be made into balls, 
dipped in beaten egg-yolks, then in bread-crumbs and fried, or 
rolled into very small balls, dipped in egg-yolks and browned 
in the oven. 

Quenelles — ^These are shapes made by forcing forcemeat 
through a pastry bag and tube into boiling water or stock. 
They are used to garnish entrees as well as soups. 

COLORING FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES 

To color brown, use browned flour or a little burnt sugar. 
(See Index for caramel recipe) or a few drops of commercial 
vegetable flavoring. 

Spinach leaves give a fine green color. Pound the uncooked 
leaves, and add to soup five minutes before serving.

FISH 



THE main difference between fish from fresh water and 
those from salt water, as food, is that the salt-water fish 
are an important source of bromin and iodin in the diet, 
and are considered desirable because of the value of iodin in 
preventing goiter. Some of the most common salt-water fish 
are cod, haddock, halibut, smelt, mackerel, salmon, shad, 
herring, oysters, clams, scallops, lobsters, crabs, shrimps and 
prawns, and some terrapins. Fish as food may be divided into: 

White Fish — Fish that have less than two per cent fat, 
examples of which are smelt, flounder, yellow perch, pike, 
pickerel, sea bass, cod and haddock. 

Medium Fat Fish — ^Fish that have two to £yq per cent fat, 
examples of which are weakfish, brook trout, mullet, and white 
perch. 

Fat or Oily Fish — ^Fish that contain five per cent or more 
of fat, examples of which are salmon, shad, herring, lake trout, 
bluefish, Spanish mackerel, butterfish, and eels. 

Shellfish — ^Mollusks (oysters, clams, scallops and mussels) ; 
crustaceans (lobsters, crabs, shrimps, prawns, crawfish or cray- 
fish) ; reptiles (frogs, terrapins and turtles. The reptiles really 
belong to a lower order of animal than fish, but as they spend 
some time in the water they are discussed in this chapter.). 

Amount of Fish to Buy 

If the fish bought is solid flesh, one-third of a pound should 
be allowed for each person. If fish is bought in the round 
(with bones, head, tail, etc.) at least one-half pound must be 
bought for each person. 

Selecting and Caring for Fish 

Fresh and Frozen Fish — Fresh fish, or fish that was frozen 
while fresh, has full or bulging bright eyes, bright red gills, 
firm and elastic flesh and fresh odor. Be sure that the flesh 
along the back-bone smells fresh; it spoils there first. Fresh 
fish sinks in fresh water. If it floats, it should not be used. 

191 



192 

As soon as fish comes from the market, clean it and put it 
into the refrigerator or other cool place until it is needed. 

Fish that is frozen immediately after it is caught, and is 
kept frozen until the time for cooking does not lose its flavor. 
It is preferable to clean and draw it without thawing, but if 
it is too hard to handle soak in cold water or allow to thaw in the 
refrigerator overnight until just flexible. Skinning is some- 
times easier than scaling. Then it should be cooked at once with- 
out further thawing. Quick frozen fish on the market today 
is cleaned and ready for use. Cook at once without thawing, 
allowing only slightly more than the usual time allotted to 
broiling or baking as the case may be. 

Cleaning and Dressing Fish 

Although fish may have been cleaned and dressed at the 
market, they are likely to need additional cleaning before they 
are cooked. If any scales have been left on a fish that is to be 
cooked with the skin on, remove them with a dull knife (a 
sharp one might cut the skin) . Draw the knife over the fish, 
from tail to head, slanting it toward the body of the fish at an 
angle of about 45°. If the fish is to be split, remove the head 
and tail. "Wash quickly under cold running water and wipe 
the fish thoroughly, inside as well as outside, with a wet cloth. 
Then wipe with a clean dry cloth and keep on a plate in a cold 
place until ready to use. 

To Skin a Fish 

Remove the fins, cut off a strip of skin along the backbone, 
and cut the skin around the gills. Pull the skin off with the 
hand. If the flesh is soft, work slowly and closely follow the 
skin with the knife, to avoid tearing the flesh. 

To Bone and Fillet a Fish 

Clean and skin the fish. Insert a sharp knife close to the 
backbone at the tail end, and cut the flesh from the bone, work- 
ing toward the head and keeping the knife as close as possible 
to the bone. Small bones that adhere to the flesh or are em- 
bedded in it must be removed with the fingers. 

Large fish, such as cod and halibut, are easily boned; in fact. 



PISH 193 

they are usually purchased in slices. Fish with many bones, 
like shad, can not be boned satisfactorily. 

Flounders are often boned, to form fillets, and are served as 
"fillets of sole." The English sole is seldom imported, and most 
of the **fillet of sole*' that is served in America is made from 
the flounder, which has a white, delicate flesh similar to the 
sole. 

A fillet is merely a piece of fish without skin and bones. 
Fillets look better on the serving platter if they are approxi- 
mately the same size. Rolled fillets are called turbans. They 
are fastened with wooden toothpicks to keep them in shape 
during cooking, but the picks are removed before the fish is 
served. 

Salted, Smoked and Canned Fish 

These may be had the year around. The following varieties 
are likely to be in any market: 

Dried Salt FiSH---Cod, haddock, hake, pollack, and whit- 
ing. 

Brine-salted Fish — Herring, mackerel, mullet, salmon, 
shad. 

Smoked Fish — Carp, catfish, eel, finnan haddie, hake, hali- 
but, lake trout, pollack, salmon, sturgeon, whitefish. 

Canned Fish — Cod, haddock, herring, mackerel, salmon, 
sardines, tunafish, oysters, shrimps, lobsters, clams. 

Pickled Fish — Sardines, eels, sturgeon, oysters, clams, scal- 
lops, lobsters and mussels. 



To Freshen Salt Fish 

Place the fish flesh side down in a large pan of fresh water, set 
the pan in a cool place and let it soak from one to forty-eight 
hours, changing the water several times. If the fish is to be 
cooked in liquid, it will need a shorter time in water than if it is 
to be cooked with very little moisture. 



Boiled Fish 

For boiling a large fish whole, a fish-kettle with strainer, a 
large kettle with a wire frying-basket or a steamer is needed. 
A plate in a piece of coarse muslin or cheese-cloth, kept for 



194 



this purpose, may be used for fish in small pieces. Clean the 
fish, rub a little salt over it, wrap it in a cloth and place it in 
the container in which it is to be boiled or steamed. 

The fish must not be put into cold water, as that extracts 
the flavor, nor into boiling water, as that breaks the skin, but 
should be put into hot water, which may then be quickly 
brought to the boiling-point. After the water boils, decrease 
the heat so that it will simmer. 

Use enough water to cover the fish, add one teaspoon of salt 
and one tablespoon of vinegar or lemon- juice to every two 
quarts of water. These whiten the flesh and make it firm as 
well as season it. After the water begins to simmer, allow five 
to ten minutes to the pound for small thin pieces and ten to 
fifteen minutes to the pound for large thick pieces.

If you wish to serve a whole boiled fish upright, as if swim- 
ming, place a carrot inside the fish to make it retain its form, 
and arrange the garnishings so that it will keep its position on 
the platter. Bind the fish to the strainer with twine when 
cooking. A fish retains shape and flavor better in a steamer 
than when immersed in water. 



FISH 195 

To steam, place the fish on a plate in the upper part of a 
steamer, allowing the same time as for boiling. 

Boiled fish needs a rich sauce, such as egg sauce, Hollandaise, 
Bechamel or drawn butter. 

Fresh-water fish or other fish without much flavor may be 
boiled in court bouillon (See Index). Stock in which fish has 
been cooked may be made into fish chowder (See Index). 

PICKLED SALMON 

4 to 5 pounds salmon 1 grated nutmeg 

2 quarts vinegar 6 blades mace 

1 ounce peppercorns 1 tablespoon salad oil 

Wrap the salmon in a fish-cloth and simmer in salted water 
about three-fourths of an hour. Drain, wrap in a dry cloth 
and set in a cold place till ready to use. For the pickle, use one 
quart of the water in which the salmon was cooked, the vine- 
gar, peppercorns, grated nutmeg and mace. Boil for a few 
minutes, in a kettle closely covered to prevent evaporation of 
the flavor. Cool. When quite cold, pour over the salmon; 
then pour in the oil. Cover closely and place in a dry cool 
place. This pickle will keep many months. 

BONED HERRINGS 

6 large herrings Parsley 

Pepper Vinegar 

Salt 6 slices buttered toast 

Select fish with roes. Split, wash, scrape and remove heads, 
roe, and backbone. Sprinkle generously with pepper, salt, and 
minced parsley, then roll each piece tightly, beginning with the 
neck, and tie with a string. Put into boiling water that is 
seasoned with pepper, salt and vinegar and simmer ten or fifteen 
minutes. Cut the roe in pieces and fry. Place the fish and roe 
on buttered toast, garnish and serve. 

Broiled Fish 

To broil a whole fish, split the fish down the back, dry 
thoroughly, sprinkle with salt, pepper and lemon-juice. Place 
fish, flesh side down, on a well-greased wire broiler. Turn and 
broil on skin side just enough to crisp the skin. Large fish are 
cut into slices one inch thick, and broiled on both sides evenly.

Small smelts are not always split open and cleaned, but the 
entrails are squeezed out carefully so as not to bruise the fish,, 
and the heads are sometimes left on. When the smelts are 
large, however, cutting down the belly to remove entrails is 
more satisfactory. Put butter, lemon-juice, salt and pepper in 
a deep plate on the back of the stove where the fat will slowly 
melt. On another plate, place the flour. Wash and wipe the 
fish and roll it in the melted, seasoned fat, and then lightly in 
the flour. Arrange on a double broiler and cook four or five 
minutes over clear coals. Serve on a warm dish with remoulade 
sauce.

fish is used, cut three or more slits in its sides and insert a strip 
of salt pork in each. Fat fish needs no larding, it has fat enough 
in itself. 

Place a cloth or a rack in the bottom of a baking-pan. Upon 
the cloth place a thin layer of minced salt pork and a few slices 
of onion and tomato. Upon these place the fish itself. Dredge 
with salt, pepper and flour and lay on more salt pork; place in 
a hot oven (425° F.) add a cup of boiling water and cover. 
Cook fifteen to twenty minutes to each pound, basting fre- 
quently, adding water after each basting if necessary. After 
the first fifteen or twenty minutes reduce the heat to 3 50° F. 
Milk may be used instead of water in baking dry fish steaks. If 
a dripping-pan is used, it is not necessary to add water, and fish 
has more flavor if cooked without water. 

Small Fish or Fillets — Follow directions for whole large 
fish, allowing a total baking period of twenty to thirty minutes.

FILLET OF FLOUNDER AU GRATIN 

5 pounds flounder 2 cups chicken stock 

2 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon lemon-juice 

3 tablespoons butter 1 slice onion 

1 cup fine bread-crumbs Salt and pepper 

1 bay-leaf 

Fillet and cut the fish into pieces about four inches long by 
three wide. Oil a baking or gratin dish and lay the fillets in it. 
Sprinkle salt and pepper over them and set in a cool place till 
needed. 

Rub together flour and butter; add onion, bay-leaf, chicken 
stock, and salt and pepper as needed. Simmer gently twenty 
minutes and then add lemon-juice, strain the sauce and pour 
it over the fish. Season lightly with salt and pepper, sprinkle 
bread-crumbs over the sauce and fish. Bake twenty minutes in 
a hot oven (425 ° F.) and serve at once in the same dish. 

HALIBUT CREOLE 

2 pounds halibut 1 slice onion 

2 cups stewed tomatoes 2 tablespoons butter 
1 cup water 1 tablespoon flour 

3 cloves Salt and pepper 

Put the tomatoes, water, cloves and onion on the stove in a 
Stewpan to boil. Mix the butter and flour together, stir them 
into the sauce when it boils and add the salt and pepper. Cook 
ten minutes and strain into a bowl. 



FISH 199 

Pour boiling water into a deep plate to the depth of one- 
half inch, and lay the fish in it for one minute, skin side down; 
when the fish is removed from the water, the black skin can 
be taken off easily. Wash the fish in cold water, season with 
salt and pepper and lay it on the baking sheet in a dripping- 
pan, put sliced lemon on top, then pour half the tomato sauce 
around the fish and bake in a hot to moderate oven (425° to 
350° F.) for thirty to forty minutes, basting three times with 
the remainder of the tomato sauce. Pour the sauce remaining 
in the bottom of the pan around the fish on the serving platter. 

Fried or Panned Fish 

After cleaning, dry the fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
dip in fine bread-crumbs, flour or corn-meal, then in egg, and 
again in crumbs, flour or corn-meal, and fry in deep fat. (See 
Index for directions for deep-fat frying. ) Small fish are cooked 
in this way, with or without head and tail; also fish steaks, 
fillets or turbans. The skin is usually removed. In some cases 
(for example, the perch) if the skin has not been removed by 
the fish dealer, it is very difficult to get it off. In this case, dip 
for a moment into boiling water and remove at once. 

Fried Fish — Small fish are fried whole; for example, smelts, 
small flounders, whitebait, small whitings, small herrings, small 
perch. Larger fish such as eels, halibut, cod, large flounder and 
sole are cut in four-inch lengths or made into fillets or turbans 
before frying. 

Fried fish are usually served with Tartar sauce, anchovy sauce 
or with lemon. 

Panned Fish — Clean, wash and dry fish, rub in flour which 
has been seasoned with salt and pepper or dip in egg and crumbs 
and saute in a saucepan in a small amount of fat. Any fish 
that can be fried can be panned. 

FILLET OF SOLE OR FLOUNDER 

2 pounds fillet of sole or Salt and pepper 
flounder Crumbs, egg 

A large sole or flounder will make four fillets. Roll up each 
fillet, 'or cut into smaller fillets, season with salt and pepper, dip 
in eggy then in crumbs and fry in deep fat (390° F.) four to 



200 

six minutes. For variety, cut the fillets up, simmer half of the 
small fillets in salted water from six to ten minutes and then 
serve with the fried ones, having the boiled ones in the center 
of the dish. Serve with a white sauce, or with Tartar sauce. 

Planked Fish 

Scale the fish. Split it down the back, clean, wash and wipe 
dry as usual. Prepare a plank of oak or hickory, about one and 
one-half inch thick, and put in the oven to heat. If using a 
gas stove, place it directly under the gas in the broiler, having 
the side which is to hold the fish nearest the flame. 

Rub the fish all over with oil, salt and pepper. Lay it skin 
side down on the plank, and put the plank on the upper grate 
of the oven, or under the broiler of a gas stove. Cook about 
one-half hour, spreading melted fat over the fish while it is 
in the oven if there is a tendency to dryness. If the fish has 
roe, the roe may be broiled on the plank beside the fish, or the 
roe may be boiled, mixed with a little white sauce, well seasoned, 
and spread over the thinnest part of the fish, £.ye minutes before 
it is finished, and covered with crumbs. 

Have ready freshly mashed potato and form a border of this 
around the fish by pressing it through a pastry-bag. Set the 
plank in the oven until the potato has browned, then send to 
table garnished with lemon and parsley. 

The size of the plank will depend on the size of the oven, 
but it must be at least three inches wider than the fish. White- 
fish and shad are best for planked fish. 

Fish Roe and Milt 

The roe (eggs) of many fish, which are available during the 
Spring, make excellent and often delicate food. Shad roe are 
most frequently used, but the roe of mackerel and of flounder 
are just as palatable and are usually much cheaper. When small 
fish contain roe, do not cook the roe in the fish; remove it and 
cook it as a separate dish. 

To Prepare Roe for Use 

Parboil it in salted, acidulated water (one tablespoon vinegar 
or legion- juice to one quart water) and simmer eight to ten 
minutes. Drain, cool, and pick out the pieces of membrane; 
the roe is then ready for any recipe. 



FISH 201 



Milt 

The part of the male fish that takes the place of the roe 
of female fish is called the milt, and may be prepared and 
cooked in just the same way. The blue vein that runs through 
the center of salmon milt should be removed before the milt is 
cooked. 

BROILED ROE 

"Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, put on greased wire 
broiler, and broil £.Ye minutes on each side. Serve with maitre 
d*h6tel sauce. 

SHAD ROE CAVIAR 

1 cup shad roe Ys cup salt or ^ cup 

prepared caviar 

Mash the cooked roe very carefully, then mix with the salt. 
Beat thoroughly and let it stand for an hour before serving. If 
preferred, the shad roe may be mixed with prepared caviar 
instead of salt. 

SCALLOPED ROE 

1 to 2 pounds shad roe Bread-crumbs 

1 cup medium white sauce Chopped parsley 

Egg-yolk Salt and pepper 

Lemon-juice 

Parboil roe as directed, drain and break up lightly with a fork. 
Sprinkle a layer of roe in a baking-dish; add one-half the yolk 
of an egg, well beaten, dropping it over the top of the roe, next 
sprinkle lightly with minced parsley, salt and pepper to taste 
and a few drops of lemon -juice; then add a layer of the white 
sauce. Repeat the layers of roe, egg, seasoning and sauce, cover 
with bread-crumbs and bits of butter and bake until brown. If 
a large dish is required, use with the roe any cold flaked fish left 
from a former meal. Any kind of roe may be prepared in this 
way.

Use any delicate fish, such as halibut, whitefish, cusk or sal- 
mon. Remove the bones and skin, and pound the meat very 
fine, so it may be rubbed through a soup-strainer. Mushrooms 
mixed with the fish before it is strained will greatly improve 
its flavor. 

Cook bread-crumbs ten minutes in milk or cream. Remove 
from fire and add melted butter or other fat, salt, pepper or 
paprika and a few gratings of nutmeg. When this is cold, add 
the fish, beat the whole thoroughly, add the eggs, also well 
beaten, and place the mixture in a greased or oiled mold. Cover 
the mold with oiled paper, set it in a deep baking-pan, place it 
in the oven, and pour water into the pan until it is within one 
inch of the top of the mold. Cook for three-quarters of an 
hour at 250° F. Hollandaise and tomato sauce are both ex-

smooth paste is formed, then stir it into the milk. Cook ten 
minutes. Take the dish from the heat, add the beaten egg, stir 
well and serve without further cooking, adding a sprinkling 
of pepper just before dishing. If the sauce is cooked after the 
egg is added, the milk is likely to curdle. The egg may be 
omitted. 

I CODFISH A LA MODE 

1 cup salt codfish 2 eggs 

2 cups mashed potatoes 54 cup butter or other fat 

" 2 cups milk or cream Pepper 

Pick very fine and freshen salt codfish as in preceding recipe;

2 tablespoons milk or cream 1 egg 

Pepper 

If the fish is not already shredded, pick out all the bones and 
shred the flesh. Simmer the fish and the sliced potatoes to- 
gether in plenty of water until the potatoes are soft. Drain, 
mash, and beat until fine and light; then add the pepper, fat 
and milk, and the egg, well beaten. Mix all thoroughly with 
a spoon. Shape into balls. Fry in a frying-basket in deep fat, 
(375°-390° F.) for two to five minutes.

2 cups raw potatoes fat 
2 tablespoons milk or cream Pepper 
2 eggs 

Place the fish and potatoes together in enough boiling water 
to cover them, and let them boil until the potatoes are done. 
Drain thoroughly, mash the potatoes and fish, and beat them 
well with a fork, adding white pepper, butter, milk or cream. 
The mass should be made light with vigorous beating. Then 



206 

beat in the well-stirred yolks of two eggs, and lastly, fold in 
the well-whipped whites. Arrange the soujffle in an oiled bak- 
ing-dish and bake in a moderate oven (375° F. ) about twenty 
mihutes, until it is brown. Serve with cucumber pickles, 
pickled peppers, horseradish or fresh cucumbers. 

SALT FISH WITH EGG GARNISH 

2 cups salt fish 2 cups milk 

4 tablespoons butter or other 4 tablespoons flour 
fat 2 hard-cooked eggs 

Soak fish over night, cook in fresh water, flake. Make a white 
sauce with the fat, flour and milk. Add the flaked fish to the 
white sauce and pour on to a warm platter. Cut the eggs into 
slices and arrange in a circle on top. Serve at once. 

SALT MACKEREL 

Boiled — 

1 salt mackerel 4 tablespoons flour 

2 cups milk 4 tablespoons butter 
Pepper 

Clean the fish by scraping off rusty-looking portions and also 
the thin black membrane found on the inside, and leave it over 
night in plenty of cold water, with the skin side up. In the 
morning, drain the fish and place it in a frying-pan, skin side 
down, cover with fresh water, and slowly heat to the boiling- 
point. Drain off this water, add just enough fresh water to 
cover the fish and simmer until tender. Lift the mackerel out 
carefully (a pancake-turner will be found convenient for such 
work) and place it on the serving-dish in the oven to keep 
hot while the gravy is being prepared. 

To one cup of the water left in the frying-pan after the 
removal of the fish, add the two cups of milk. When the 
liquid boils, add the flour stirred to a paste with the fat, and 
season with salt and pepper. Let the gravy boil slowly three 
or four minutes, stirring constantly until smooth. Pour it 
over the mackerel. 

Baked — Prepare the fish as for boiling but place it in a shal- 
low baking-pan just large enough to hold it, and pour over it 
the milk. Bake twenty minutes in a hot oven (400° -42 5° F.) 
stirring into the milk at the end of fifteen minutes a smooth 



FISH 207 

paste made of two tablespoons of flour and two tablespoons of 
fat, with a sprinkling of pepper. Serve with the thickened milk 
poured around the fish. 

BROILED SALT FISH 

Soak in tepid water twenty-four hours, changing the water 
several times. At the hour wanted, broil, season to taste, dot- 
ting with bits of butter. All kinds of salt fish may be broiled 
in this way. 

BROILED FINNAN HADDIE 

1 finnan haddie Oil Lemon-juice 

Soak the fish in cold water for three-quarters of an hour, 
then lay in boiling water for five minutes. Wipe very dry, 
rub oil and lemon-juice into the fish and broil over a clear fire 
for fifteen minutes. Serve with hot butter sauce. 

CREAMED FINNAN HADDIE 

1 cup flaked finnan haddie, 1 cup medium white sauce 

fresh-cooked or canned Salt, pepper, paprika 

If the whole fish is used, put it in a baking-pan, cover with 
cold water, and after soaking twenty minutes, bring the water 
to a boil. Reduce the heat and allow it to simmer for one-half 
hour. Drain, rinse, and with a fork separate the fish into flakes. 
Canned finnan haddie should be steamed. To one cup of fish, 
add one cup of medium white sauce. Bring to a boil; season 
with salt, pepper and a liberal quantity of paprika. 

Oysters 

Oysters, to be safe and palatable food, must be perfectly 
fresh. Buy them in the shells, if possible, and when purchas- 
ing them without shells be sure that the liquor is clear; if it 
is cloudy, the oysters should not be used. 

Opening and Cleaning Oysters 

To open an oyster, hold it firmly with the thick part of the 
shell toward the palm of the hand. Wash the shell thoroughly. 
Push a strong, thin knife between the shells near the back and 
run it along until it cuts the strong muscle which holds the 



208 

shells together. Drop the oysters into a strainer, set over a 
bowl, and save the liquor that drains through to be used in 
cooking the oysters or making soup or sauce. Then examine 
each oyster and with the fingers remove all particles of shell. 
They are then ready to be used in any way desired. 

OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL 

Raw oysters are served either on the half shell packed in 
crushed ice, on oyster plates, or in a block of ice. Allow to 
each person £ye or six oysters and one-fourth of a lemon, and 
pass with the oysters crackers or thin slices of delicately buttered 
brown or graham bread. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL 

30 medium oysters 1 teaspoon salt 

2 teaspoons prepared horse- 2 tablespoons vinegar 
radish 4 tablespoons lemon-juice 

3 tablespoons tomato catchup J4 teaspoon tabasco sauce 

Where oysters in the shell are obtainable, they are usually 
served on the half shell, on a plate of crushed ice, around a 
small glass holding the cocktail mixture. When it is not pos- 
sible to get the oysters in the shell, cocktails may be served in 
ice shells made for this purpose, or in cases made from green- 
pepper shells, in halves of grapefruit, or in large claret glasses. 
Put five medium oysters into each glass and pour the dressing 
over them. To make the dressing, mix horseradish, tomato 
catchup and vinegar, lemon-juice, tabasco sauce, and salt 
thoroughly. Both oysters and dressing should be very cold. 



PANNED OYSTERS 

1 pint large oysters J4 cup oyster-juice 

6 slices buttered toast 

Lay the oysters in a shallow dripping-pan, and pour over 
them a small quantity of oyster-juice, but not sufficient to raise 
or float them. Place the dish carefully in a hot oven (400°- 
425° F.) and just heat the oysters through. Be careful not 
to bake them. Moisten hot buttered toast with the hot juice 
from the oysters and serve the oysters on the toast. 



FISH 209 



LITTLE PIGS IN BLANKETS OR OYSTER BUNDLES 

24 large oysters Salt and pepper 

24 very thin slices fat bacon Parsley 

Season the oysters with salt and pepper. "Wrap one oyster 
in each slice of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Heat a 
frying pan and put in the oysters. Cook on one side and then 
on the other just long enough to crisp the bacon, about five 
minutes. Cut slices of toast into quarters and place one oyster 
on each small slice of toast. Serve immediately, garnished with 
parsley. 

CREAMED OYSTERS 

1 pint oysters 6 tablespoons flour 

4 tablespoons butter or other 1 pint rich milk

oysters and sauce, add seasoning and serve. 



OYSTERS A LA POULETTE 

1 pint oysters Nutmeg 

1 ^ cups milk or cream 2, egg-yolks or 1 whole egg 

1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons flour 

Salt and pepper Cayenne 

Set the oysters on the stove to heat in their own liquor. As 
soon as they begin to boil, skim carefully and turn them into 
a strainer. Add one-half cup of oyster liquor to one cup of 
milk or cream and make a white sauce with the fat, flour and 
this liquid. Season with salt, pepper, a slight grating of nut- 
meg and a grain of cayenne. Add one-fourth cup of cold 
milk or cream to the well-beaten egg or yolks of eggs. Place the 
oysters in the white sauce and add to the egg mixture. Cook 
over hot water for three minutes, or until the eggs thicken, 
stirring all the time; remove from fire immediately to pre- 
vent separating. Serve with a border of puff-paste cakes, 
buttered toast or baking-powder biscuit. If liked, one-half 
tablespoon of lemon-juice may be added just as the oysters are 
taken from the fire.

FRIED OYSTERS 

1 pint oysters 2 eggs 

1 Yz cups milk 2 cups flour 

1 teaspoon salt 

Scald the oysters in their own liquor, and drain them 
thoroughly on a cloth. Make a batter with the milk, Qgg, flour 
and salt and dip the oysters in it. Fry a light brown, in deep 
fat (375°-390° F., two to five minutes) drain and serve. 
Seasoned bread-crumbs may be used instead of the batter. 

OYSTERS COOKED IN THE SHELL 

30 oysters in the shell Salt 

Butter Pepper 

Wash the shells thoroughly by scrubbing with a brush. Place 
in a baking-pan with the deep shell down. Set into a very 
hot oven (450°-500° F.) and bake until the shells open. Or, 
cover the pan, set it over a pot of boiling water, and steam 
until the shells open. Add a little butter, salt, and pepper to 
each oyster and serve immediately in the shells. 

OYSTERS EN BROCHETTE 

30 large oysters 6 slices toast ^ pound bacon 

Cut the bacon into thin strips and cut the strips into pieces 
an inch or an inch and a half square. String the oysters and 
bacon squares alternately on six long, slender steel skewers, 
being careful to run the skewers through the hard part of 
the oysters. Place the skewers across a narrow, deep baking- 
tin so that the oysters will hang down but not touch the bottom 
of the tin; leave space between the skewers so that the heat will 
pass evenly around them. Cook in a very hot oven (450°- 
475° F.) for five minutes, or long enough to crisp the bacon. 
Place a skewer on each slice of toast. Pour the juice in the 
pan over the toast and serve immediately. 

BROILED OYSTERS 

30 large oysters Salt and pepper 

Butter Bread-crumbs, if desired 

Dry the oysters on a towel; sprinkle them with salt and pep- 
per and lay them in an oyster broiler (a fine-mesh broiler).

1 cup cooked mushrooms fat 

(fresh or canned) 1 teaspoon onion- juice 

lYz cups milk J/2 teaspoon lemon- juice 

3 tablespoons flour 2 egg-yolks or 1 egg 
Yz teaspoon salt 

Drain the oysters and put them into a hot pan. Cook until 
the edges begin to curl, then remove to a hot dish. Make a 
sauce by adding to the oyster liquor the juice from the mush- 
rooms, and enough milk to make a pint. Thicken this with 
the flour blended with the butter or other fat and cook two 
to five minutes. Add chopped mushrooms, onion-juice, lemon- 
juice and a little salt. 

Beat the yolks of the eggs; add a little of the hot mixture, 
slowly, then all of it. Add the oysters, and cook over hot 
water until the sauce thickens, stirring constantly. Remove 
from the fire and serve at once. 

BAKED OYSTERS WITH SPAGHETTI 

^ pound spaghetti lYz cups milk 

1 pint oysters 2 tablespoons flour 

Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons butter or other 

1 cup bread-crumbs fat 

Ys cup melted fat 

Break the spaghetti into small pieces, boil it in plenty of salted 
boiling water until it is quite tender, and then drain. Scald 
the oysters in their own liquor, reserving the liquor. Oil a 
baking-dish, put in a layer of the spaghetti and then a layer of 
the oysters, season with salt and pepper, and repeat the layers 
until all the oysters and spaghetti are used, finishing with a 
layer of spaghetti. To the liquor from the oysters, add enough 
milk to make a pint, reserving a small quantity to mix with the 
flour. Scald the remainder, add the scalded milk to the 
moistened flour, stir well and cook twenty minutes in a double 
boiler. Take from the fire, add the melted fat and pour over 
the layers in the dish. Top with bread-crumbs mixed with 



212 

melted fat (see recipe for buttered crumbs), and bake in a 
quick oven (400° -450° F.) just long enough to brown the 
crumbs, about ten minutes. 

OYSTERS SAUTEED 

30 oysters Salt and pepper 

Bread or cracker-crumbs Fat for sauteing 

Drain the oysters well, season with salt and pepper and roll 
in fine bread or cracker-crumbs. Place two or three tablespoons 
fat in a saucepan and when it becomes very hot drop in enough 
oysters to cover the bottom of the pan. When one side is 
browned, turn the oysters carefully to brown the other side. 
Add more fat as needed. The iron pancake griddle is often 
used for this purpose, when many oysters are to be cooked at 
one time. Serve very hot on toast. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

1 pint oysters 6 tablespoons butter or other 

2 cups soft bread-crumbs fat 

J/4 cup milk Salt and pepper 

Oil a baking-dish; put in a layer of crumbs, then a layer of 
oysters, butter or other fat in little pieces, salt and pepper. 
Repeat, ending with a layer of crumbs, with small pieces of fat 
dotted over them. Do not have more than two layers of oysters. 
Moisten with milk and oyster liquor mixed together. Bake in 
a moderate oven (350°-400° F.) until brown, about half an 
hour, and serve in the same dish. 

OYSTER CASINO 

30 oysters in the shell Pepper and salt 

Lemon-juice 30 one-inch squares sliced 

Buttered crumbs bacon 

"Wash and open the oysters. Into each shell put a half-tea- 
spoon of strained oyster liquor, a few drops of lemon- juice, 
then the oyster sprinkled with pepper and salt and covered with 
buttered crumbs. On each lay an inch square of bacon and set 
in a hot oven (400°-450° F.) for ten or twelve minutes. Shal- 
low ovenware dishes, with the half -shells embedded in coarse 
salt, are excellent for this purpose. The salt keeps the shells 
from tipping during baking. Where shells are not available. 



FISH 213 

arrange the oysters for each portion in a shallow ramekin. 
These are excellent for Sunday-night supper or as a luncheon 
dish. 

DEVILED OYSTERS 

1 pint oysters 1 cup milk or cream 
3 tablespoons butter or other 2 egg-yolks 

fat Salt and pepper 

2 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 

Drain the oysters, chop them, not too fine, and drain again. 
Make a white sauce with two tablespoons of the fat, the flour 
and the milk, remove from the fire and add the beaten yolks, 
the salt, pepper and parsley, and then the oysters. Fill small 
ramekins with the mixture, sprinkle lightly with soft bread 
crumbs, dot with fat, arrange in a baking-pan, and brown in a 
quick oven (400° -42 5° F., about seven minutes). 

Clams 

Clams, like oysters, should be purchased in the shell whenever 
possible. The shell opens when the animal dies, making it easy 
to discard the bad ones. A dead clam is dangerous food. 

If obtained the day before they are to be used, cover the 
clams with cold water and sprinkle corn-meal over the top of 
the water, using about one cup of corn-meal for a peck of 
clams. Let them stand over night. 

To open clams steam in tightly covered vessel and if the 
clams are not to be served at once, remove them from the shells 
and drop them into cold water, to keep them from becoming 
tough. A peck will yield about a quart of clams without the 
shells. 

Cut oflF the siphons of large clams,, as that part is very tough, 
and if the clams have not been treated with corn-meal, open 
the stomachs with a pair of scissors and scrape out the debris. 
Wash the clams well, to remove all sand. 

J CLAMS ON THE HALF SHELL 

Small clams are served raw on the half shell, just as raw; 
oysters are served. (See Index.) 

CLAM COCKTAIL 

Follow recipe for oyster cocktail. (See Index.)

CLAMS COOKED IN THE SHELL 

Steamed — 

30 clams in the shell Juice of Yz lemon 

6 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper 

The hard-shell clam is used for steaming. Scrub the shell 
with a brush and wash free of sand in several waters. Steam 
the clams in a steamer for ten minutes, or until opened. While 
the clams are steaming, melt the butter and mix with the 
lemon-juice, salt and pepper. Lay a napkin on a hot platter 
and place the clams in their shells on this. Cover with a 
second napkin and serve. In eating, remove the clam from 
the shell and dip it into the sauce. The thin, tough part known 
as the neck or siphon is not eaten. 

Roasted in the Oven — Prepare the clams as for steaming, 
put them into a pan, set the pan in a hot oven (400 ° -42 5 ° F.) 
and bake until the shells open. Remove the top shell, being 
careful not to spill the liquor. Arrange the clams in the half- 
shells on plates and on each place a piece of butter and a little 
pepper and salt. Add lemon -juice if desired. Serve imme- 
diately. 

Clam-bake Roast — ^The seashore is the natural place for a 
clam-bake, but it is possible to have one at any place where 
there is a flat open space. Preparations should begin several 
hours before the time set for the meal. 

Make a circle of flat stones — from two to four feet in 
diameter, according to the size of the party — and on this circle 
build a hot fire of wood. Let this burn for two or three hours. 
Then rake off the fire and cover the hot stones with fresh sea- 
weed. On this lay fresh clams in their shells; also, if desired, 
oysters, potatoes in the skins, corn in the husk, and anything 
else that may be steamed. Cover with a thick layer of sea- 
weed^ and over all spread a large piece of sailcloth, fastening 
down the edges with stones. Leave for two or three hours; 
remove the cloth and the top layer of seaweed, and rake out 
the clams and other foods as needed. 

The same materials may be cooked in a large kettle at home 
using cheese-cloth between the layers, but will lack the fine 
flavor of the real clam-bake.

FRIED SOFT CLAMS 

Wash soft clams (fresh or canned) and drain them upon a 
soft cloth, wiping them dry. Then dip each clam first into 
beaten q^^ and next into bread-crumbs, and, if much breading 
is liked, dip them again into the q^^ and crumbs. Have a sauce- 
pan containing hot fat (390° F.) about an inch deep. If you 
have no thermometer, test the fat by dropping in a bit of the 
soft part of bread. It should color to a golden hue in from 
40 to 50 seconds. Lay the clams in the fat, one at a time 
but as quickly as possible, and cook them until brown (about 
one to two minutes) . Serve very hot.

SCALLOPED CLAMS 

18 opened clams 48 very small dice of fat 

6 large clams in shell bacon 

White pepper 4 tablespoons cracker-dust 

2 tablespoons minced celery 2 tablespoons butter or other 

fat 

Have the clams opened carefully, so that the shells will not 
be broken. Clean the shells well with brush and water. Lay- 
two clams in each half shell, dust with white pepper, and one- 
half teaspoon of minced celery, and add four of the bacon 
dice; cover with a very thin layer of cracker-dust, put a half 
teaspoon fat on top and bake in the oven (3 50° -400° F.) fif- 
teen to thirty minutes. 



Scallops 

The nearly round, ribbed shell of the scallop is known to 
many who have never seen the scallop itself. Only those who 
live in seashore towns ever see the whole bivalve, as the non- 
edible portions are discarded before the edible part, the large 
adductor muscle, is sent to market.

Sea Mussels 

Sea mussels are as agreeable to the taste as oysters, and may 
be eaten when oysters are out of season. Canned mussels are 
obtainable nearly everywhere. When fresh mussels are used, 
the shells may be opened by steaming, or with a knife. The 
horny "beard" must be removed and discarded. 

PANNED MUSSELS 

30 mussels in the shell Cayenne 

2 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper 

2 tablespoons flour Lemon-juice 

"Wash the shell with a brush in cold water, and open by steam- 
ing. Remove the mussels from the shells, place them in a 
saucepan, add the butter, salt and pepper, cayenne, and a dash 
of lemon-juice. Mix the flour with an equal quantity of cold 
water and rub out all the lumps, then add more water to make 
it about as thick as rich cream. Pour in a thin stream into the 
hot mixture, stirring constantly. As soon as the boiling- 
point is reached, remove from the fire and serve. Mussels, like 
oysters and clams, are made tough by over-cooking.

Lobster 

Lobsters are in season from June to September, and it is possi- 
ble to obtain them at any time of the year. The shell of a live 



2l8 

lobster is usually a mottled dark green. Boiling makes the shells 
of all lobsters turn bright red. 

Uncooked lobsters should be alive when purchased. In buy- 
ing a boiled lobster, straighten its tail; if it springs back into 
place, the lobster was alive, as it should have been, when boiled. 

To Boil and Dress a Lobster 

Plunge the live lobster into boiling water, head downward. 
Add one tablespoon of salt, cover the kettle and keep it boiling. 
A medium-sized lobster will cook in about twenty minutes. 
Plunge it into cold water when done and when cool enough to 
handle, take the meat from the shell in the following order: 
Chop off the claws. Split the body lengthwise, remove and 
throw away the stomach, a small sac just back of the head. 
Running from the stomach to the base of the tail is the in- 
testinal canal. If this does not pull out with the stomach, it 
must be lifted out with a fork, in pieces, if necessary, and re- 
moved entirely. 

Crack the claws and remove the meat. If the lobster is not 
to be served whole, take out the meat from the body, the 
creamy green fat which constitutes the liver, and the coral or 
spawn found in female lobsters. The spongy particles between 
the meat and shell are not used. 

In cutting up the meat of cooked lobster, always use a silver 
knife or one of stainless steel, if possible, as an ordinary steel 
knife discolors or darkens the meat. 

COLD LOBSTER EN COQUILLES, WITH 

MAYONNAISE 

This is simply cold boiled lobster, served in the shell, a spoon- 
ful of mayonnaise, colored red with the coral of the lobster, 
being laid on top of the lobster meat and the whole served in 
a bed of lettuce leaves. Canned lobster meat also makes a very 
nice dish served with lettuce and mayonnaise. 

BROILED LIVE LOBSTER 

1 lobster Melted butter 

Salt and pepper 

Kill the fish by inserting a sharp knife in its back between 
the body and tail shells, severing the spinal cord. Split length- 



FISH 219 

wise, remove the stomach and intestinal canal, crack the large 
claws and lay the fish as flat as possible. Brush the meat with 
fat; season with salt and pepper, place in a broiler, with the 
shell side down, and broil slowly until of a delicate brown. 
Twenty minutes is usually long enough. Turn the broiler and 
broil for ten minutes longer. Serve hot, with melted butter. 

BAKED LIVE LOBSTER 

Prepare as for broiling. Lay the lobster in a baking-pan, shell 
side down, season with salt, pepper and butter. Bake about 
forty minutes in a hot oven (400° F.), basting it twice with 
melted butter. 

LOBSTER FARCI 

2 lobsters 1 tablespoon parsley 

1 cup milk Salt and pepper 

1 tablespoon butter Nutmeg 

1 tablespoon flour 3 egg-yolks, hard cooked 

2 tablespoons bread-crumbs 

Boil the lobsters and cut the meat into small pieces. In open- 
ing the lobsters be careful not to break the body or tail shells. 
Make a white sauce with the milk, butter and flour. Remove 
from the fire and add the crumbs, parsley, lobster, salt and pep- 
per, a grating of nutmeg and the yolks of the eggs mashed very 
fine. Mix all well together. Wash the shells and wipe them 
dry, and with a pair of scissors cut off the under part of the 
tail shells. Join the large ends of both tail shells to one body 
shell, to form a boat-shaped receptacle. Put the lobster mixture 
into this boat, brush over the top with beaten eg§, sprinkte 
lightly with bread-crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven (3 50°- 
400° F.) fifteen to thirty minutes.

nearly cold, add the beaten eggs, the lobster chopped fine, 
anchovy sauce, salt and pepper, and a large pinch of cayenne. 
Stir well, then add cream. Pour into an oiled mold, cover with 
an oiled paper and steam one hour. Serve with anchovy or 
other fish sauce. 

DEVILED OR SCALLOPED LOBSTER 

2 c«ps fresh or canned lobster Nutmeg 

1 cup soft bread-crumbs 1 tablespoon butter or other 

1 hard-cooked egg fat 

2 teaspoons lemon-juice 1 tablespoon flour 
Salt 1 cup milk 
Cayenne 

Cut the lobster meat into dice. Add one-half cup of bread- 
crumbs, the egg chopped very fine and the lemon-juice, season- 
ing generously with salt and cayenne pepper and a grating of 
nutmeg. Make a white sauce of the fat, flour and milk. Add 
the white sauce to the lobster mixture to make a paste. Fill 
scallop-shells or shallow ramekins with the mixture, smooth 
the tops, sprinkle with remaining bread-crumbs and bake in a 
moderate oven (3 50° -400 F.) from fifteen to thirty minutes. 

LOBSTER WITH CORAL SAUCE 

No. 1. 

1 medium-sized lobster 2 tablespoons flour 

3 tablespoons butter or other 1 pint boiling water 

fat 2 tablespoons lemon-juice 

Cut the meat of the boiled lobster into small pieces and mash 
the coral with a tablespoon of fat. Rub the flour and the rest 
of the fat to a smooth paste. Add boiling water and cook five 
minutes, then add the coral and butter and lemon-juice. Sim- 
mer for four minutes. Strain the sauce over the lobster meatj 
place the whole on the fire and boil up once. 



FISH 221 

No. 2. 

1 medium-sized boiled lobster Yz pint drawn-butter sauce 

Salt and pepper 

Break up the coral and put it on a paper in a slow oven 
(2 50° -3 00° F.) for thirty minutes. Then pound it and set it 
aside. Chop the lobster meat, not too fine, and add it to the 
sauce, also putting in a pinch of the coral and salt and pepper to 
taste. The effect is spoiled if the lobster is cut too fine. The 
sauce should be like a creamy bed for the lobster. Serve in a 
shallow dish with the pounded coral sprinkled over the top. 

Crabs 

The blue crab, found on the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf 
of Mexico, is about two and one-half inches long by five inches 
wide. The Dungeness crab of the Pacific Coast is much larger. 
Crabs go through a molting season, in the Spring and Summer. 
During the few days between the shedding of the old shell and 
the hardening of the new one, they are called soft-shell crabs. 
At other times, they are called hard-shell crabs. 

Oyster crabs are tiny, almost transparent, grayish-white 
crabs found in the shells with oysters. They are often served 
in oyster stews. 

Dressing Crabs 

All uncooked crabs should be vigorously alive when pur- 
chased, or the meat is not good. To prepare them for cooking, 
proceed as follows: 

Soft-shell Crabs — ^The back of the crab tapers to a point 
at each side. Lay the crab on its face, take one of these points 
between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand and pull the 
shell back about half-way. Pull off all the spongy substance 
which is thus exposed. Repeat the operation at the point on 
the opposite side. Pull off the tail (apron) which laps under 
the crab, and the spongy substance under it. "Wash the crabs 
in cold water, and they are ready for cooking. 

Hard-shell Crabs — ^Throw the live crabs head first into 
rapidly boiling water. After ^yq minutes, add one tablespoon 
of salt and boil for thirty minutes. When cold, break off the 
apron, or tail. Take the crab in both hands, with the thumbs 
at the tail end, and pull the upper and lower shells apart. Dis- 



222 

card the material that sticks to the upper shell and pull off 
all the orange waxy material and white spongy substance be- 
tween the halves of the body and at each side. The edible part 
of the crab lies in the two compact masses remaining, and in 
the small flakes that may be extracted from the large claws. 
The latter must be broken with a cleaver or hammer. 

BROILED SOFT-SHELL CRABS 

6 soft-shell crabs Salt and pepper 

Yi cup butter or other fat 54 teaspoon cayenne

Shrimps and Prawns 

Shrimps and prawns are very similar, but the prawn is larger 
than the shrimp; the former is often six or seven inches long, 
while the latter is seldom more than two inches. 

To Prepare Fresh Shrimps, simmer them in salted water, 
wash and drain. Remove the shell carefully, also the black line 
that runs the length of the body. 

CREAMED SHRIMPS 

2 cups cooked shrimps, 4 tablespoons flour 

fresh or canned 2 cups milk 

2 tablespoons butter or other Salt and pepper 

fat 

Make a white sauce with the fat, flour and milk, add shrimps, 
whole or broken into small pieces. When thoroughly heated, 
add seasoning and serve. 

SCALLOPED SHRIMPS 

2 cups cooked shrimps, 1 cup bread-crumbs 

fresh or canned 2 cups boiling water 

4 tablespoons butter or other 1 teaspoon lemon-juice 

fat 1 teaspoon salt 

4 tablespoons flour I/2 teaspoon pepper 

1 teaspoon mustard 

Prepare shrimps as directed. Melt three and one-half table- 
spoons of the fat in a saucepan. Add the flour and mustard and 
beat until light. Gradually pour the hot water on this. Place 
the saucepan on a fire, and stir the contents until they begin to 
boil. Add the lemon-juice, salt and pepper, and cook for six 
minutes, then stir in the shrimps. Turn the mixture into a shal- 



t FISH 225 

low scallop-dish, cover with the bread-crumbs and dot with the 
I half-tablespoon of butter broken into little bits. Bake for 
twenty minutes in a moderate oven (350° F.). 

DEVILED SHRIMPS 

1 cup shrimps, fresh or canned 3 hard-cooked eggs 

3 tablespoons butter or other Paprika 

fat 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 

4 tablespoons flour Few drops onion-juice 

2 cups milk Buttered crumbs 

Prepare shrimps as directed. Melt the fat, add the flour and 
stir until smooth. Add the milk, heat, stirring constantly, and 
when it begins to thicken, add the eggs, which have been put 
through the sieve. Cut the shrimps with a silver knife, and 
add to the sauce; season with the paprika, parsley, and onion- 
juice. Put the mixture in ramekins, cover with seasoned 
crumbs, and brown in a quick oven. 

Fresh- Water Crawfish 

Crawfish, or crayfish, look like lobsters, but are much smaller. 
They may be prepared and served in the same way as lobsters. 

Cook the crawfish in boiling salted water, drain, and remove 
the shell. Take out the intestines by pinching the extreme end 
of the center fin and jerking it suddenly. This removes the 
gall-cyst, which is very bitter. 



Frogs 

Frogs' legs (hindquarters only) are considered quite a deli- 
cacy. The skin can be turned over and slipped off the legs, 
like a glove taken off inside out. 

FRIED FROGS' LEGS 

6 frogs* legs Salt and pepper 

1 egg Fine bread-crumbs 

Lemon-juice 

Skin the legs and wash them in cold water; dry well on a 
towel or napkin. Season with salt, pepper and lemon-juice. 
Beat the egg, and season it with salt and pepper; dip the legs into 



226 

the eggy then into dried bread-crumbs or fine cracker-crumbs, 
plunge them into deep fat (390° F.) and fry two to three 
minutes. Use a wire frying-basket, if possible. Frogs' legs are 
served for breakfast or luncheon and for the latter meal they 
are accompanied by Tartar sauce. 

Turtles and Terrapins 

These animals should be alive when purchased. If the large 
southern variety, the soft-shell or snapping turtles are used, cut 
off the head and let the turtle lie in cold water one-half hour 
or hang on a hook with neck down until blood stops dripping. 
Then wash and drop into boiling water and cook for ten 
minutes. Pour off the water and cover the turtle with cold 
water, letting it stand until cool enough to handle easily; then 
with a towel rub the nails and black skin from the legs. 

"Wash the turtle carefully, place it in a saucepan covered 
with boiling water and simmer until the flesh is tender. This 
will be when the joints of the legs can be broken with a slight 
pressure, and the shells separate easily. It will take from thirty 
to sixty minutes. It should be cooked until the skin is like 
jelly. Remove the turtle from the water, and after it has cooled 
a little, place it on its back with the head away from you, and 
loosen and remove the under shell. 

The liver, gall bladder and sand bag will be found near the 
head end, the gall being attached to the left side of the liver. 
Take out the gall as you would that of a chicken, being care- 
ful not to break it. Remove the entrails and throw them away. 

Take out the eggs, if there are any, remove the slight mem- 
brane and drop them into cold water. Cut all the meat very 
fine, saving any water that may collect in the shells. The turtle 
is now ready to use in a stew or in other ways. 

If terrapin is used, wash and plunge it alive into boiling 
salted water, and cook for about ten minutes. Then plunge 
it into cold water, rub off the toe nails and dark skin, place 
it again in salted boiling water and cook until the legs are 
tender, from thirty to sixty minutes. Clean the terrapin ac- 
cording to directions for turtles, but instead of throwing away 
the small intestines, cut them in very small pieces and use them 
for food. Discard the thick, heavy part of the intestines. 



FISH 227

Add the terrapin or turtle meat cut fine and simmer for ten 
minutes. Serve very hot. Terrapin is very often served in indi- 
vidual metal cups or saucepans with covers.

MEAT 



THE name meat Is given generally to all edible flesh of ani- 
mals used for food. The name beef is used for the flesh 
of adult cattle; veal for the flesh of calves under one year of 
age; pork for the flesh of swine; mutton for the flesh of adult 
sheep and lamb for the flesh of sheep from six weeks to one 
year old. 

SELECTION OF MEAT 

There are certain characteristics of good meat which serve 
as a guide to the purchaser. Flecks of fat all through the fibers 
indicate tenderness and flavor. Thin connecting tissue means 
a tender cut; thick tissue, a tough one. Meat well ripened or 
hung some time after slaughter is more tender than freshly 
killed meat. Meat of any kind should have a fresh odor and 
no dark, dry edges or spots. 



Beef 

Good beef should have a bright red color and a moist juicy 
surface when freshly cut; firm, fine-grained muscle; dry, 
crumbly suet, white in color; and a thick solid edge of straw- 
colored fat. 

Veal 

Veal should be at least six weeks old before slaughter. The 
sale of "bob" veal is prohibited in many states; it is soft and 
of poor flavor. Prime veal should be a faint pink color with 
little or no edge of fat. Flecks of fat in the meat should show 
a pinkish tinge. Milk-fed veal is particularly good. 



Pork 

Pork should have firm white flesh with a faint pink tinge. 
The fat should be clear white. Pork of dull appearance, with 
yellowish lumps through the meat or fat should be avoided. 

228 



MEAT 229 



Lamb and Mutton 

Lamb may be distinguished from mutton by the bones. In 
young lamb, the bones are sHghtly streaked with red and the 
joint is serrated. The joint of mutton is smooth and round. 
Lamb or mutton should have a deep pink flesh, hard white kid- 
ney fat, thin edge fat of a pinkish tinge, and firm, fine-grained 
fibers. The outer skin and fat of mutton should be torn oflf 
before the meat is cooked. 

Glands and Organs 

Liver — Calf's liver is often considered most choice in tender- 
ness and in flavor. Lamb's, however, is equally good and often 
cheaper in price. Pig's liver is good, and even beef liver is 
acceptable if properly prepared. 

Because of its value as an iron-rich food, liver is used exten- 
sively in the prevention and treatment of anemia. 

Kidneys — Calf's kidneys are best. Lamb's kidneys are good 
if the lamb is young. 

Sweetbreads — Sweetbreads from the young calf or lamb 
are used. There are two kinds, those in the throat and those 
near the heart. Those near the heart are round and compact 
and are considered slightly more desirable than those in the 
throat. Sweetbreads spoil quickly, therefore they should not 
be kept very long. 

Heart — Calf's and lamb's hearts are more tender than those 
from beef or mutton. 

Tongue — Calf's and lamb's tongues are most desirable. The 
tongue of older animals may be used in some recipes. 

Brain — Calf's brains are most desirable. Although a deli- 
cacy, there is so little demand for them that in many markets 
they may be purchased cheaply. 

Tripe — A part of the stomach of a ruminant — that from 
the ox is the one usually used for food. 

Amount of Meat to Buy for Each Person 

Meat shrinks from one-third to one-half in cooking. There- 
fore allow one-fourth pound of meat without bone for each 
serving, and one-half pound of meat consisting of lean, fat 
and bone as a minimum for each serving. 



I 



230 



Cuts of Meat 

Animals dressed for market are divided lengthwise through 
the backbone into two parts, each of which is called a side. 
Each side is divided again into two parts, the forequarter and 
the hindquarter. Each quarter is then divided into smaller 
cuts which are sold in the retail market. 



Comparative Cost of Various Cuts 

As a general rule the price of the different cuts of meat is 
determined by considerations such as tenderness, grain, general 
appearance and convenience of cooking rather than by food 
values in terms of fat or protein, or the ease with which they 
are digested. The cheapest cuts for lean meat are the neck and 
the two shanks. The cheapest for general use are the shanks, 
plates and chuck. The cheapest cuts for fat and lean are the 
neck, shank and plate. 

Beefsteaks, in the order of their economy as food, range as 
follows: chuck, round, flank, sirloin, and club or Porterhouse. 
Of the roasts of beef, the cheapest in terms of lean meat is the 
rump and most expensive is the first cut of the prime ribs. For 
stews and boiling, the neck and shank are less expensive than 
the rib ends and the brisket. 



CARE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 

As soon as meat comes from the market, the wrapping-paper 
should be removed, and the meat should be put on a granite 
or porcelain plate and placed in the refrigerator or other cool 
place. 

Before cooking meat, wash quickly under running water, 
remove outer membrane and inspection stamp. In hot weather, 
if meat is to be kept any length of time and there is any danger 
of its spoiling, it may be seared on the outside on a hot griddle 
or may be plunged into boiling water and kept there for Hve 
minutes; lamb, mutton, or veal may be partly cooked. It should 
then be cooled as quickly as possible, uncovered, and put into 
the refrigerator or other cool place. If meat has become slightly 
"strong," it may be rubbed with salt and the salt wiped off

for a few minutes in boiUng water, wiped with a damp cloth 
and then cooked. 

METHODS OF COOKING MEAT 

Meat is cooked to soften connective tissue, to develop flavor, 
to improve appearance and to destroy bacteria or other organ- 
isms. The method of cooking depends on the kind and quality 
of the meat to be cooked. Only tender cuts of meat can be 
cooked successfully by dry heat. Although as desirable in 
nutritive value and flavor, the tough cuts of meat require moist 
heat and long, slow cooking to make them palatable. Since 
meat is largely protein, even the tenderest cuts may be toughened 
and hardened by too high a temperature. 

Searing — Meat is placed in a hot pan containing fat, a hot 
oven or over an open fire and is quickly browned on all sides. 
The temperature is then reduced and the cooking process con- 
tinued. Searing does not keep in the juices as was formerly 
thought but does produce a browner exterior. 

Broiling — Meat is cooked over or under or in front of an 
open fire or other direct heat. The meat is placed so that there 
is a distance of 3 or 4 inches between top of meat and source 
of heat. Broil on one side until nicely browned, turn and finish 
broiling. Season. Chops and tender steaks as porterhouse, sir- 
loin and first or second cut of round are the most desirable for 
broiling. 

Pan Broiling — Meat is placed in a sizzling hot skillet and 
browned on both sides. Reduce temperature and cook until as 
well done as desired, turning from time to time. 

Roasting — Meat is placed on a rack in an uncovered roast- 
ing pan, fat side up and baked in a slow oven, without water 
until as well done as desired. Basting is not necessary. The 
large tender cuts of meat are cooked by this method. 

Cooking in Water — Meat is covered with boiling water, 
then seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked slowly at sim- 
mering temperature, not boiling, until meat is tender. 

Stewing — Meat is cut into cubes. Brown, if desired, 
on all sides in hot fat, cover with boiling water and cook 
at simmering temperature in a covered kettle until meat is 
tender. Less tender cuts containing much connective tissue

are best cooked by this method which softens both tissue and 
fiber. 

The best cuts for stews are those containing both fat and 
lean and some bone. The shank is the most economical of all 
cuts for this purpose. Other cuts used are the neck, plate, flank, 
heel of the round and the short ribs. The brisket and the rump 
are sometimes used. Occasionally a cut like the round is used, 
as in beef a la mode. 

In making stews, one-fourth pound of clear meat or one- 
half pound of meat and bones should be allowed for each 
serving. One to two potatoes, one to two medium-sized car- 
rots, one small onion, one-fourth medium-sized turnip and one 
stalk of celery may be used for each person served. Any or 
all of these may be omitted. 

Braising — ^Use a thick-walled kettle or frying pan. Brown 
sliced onion and snip of garlic in a small amount of fat and sear 
meat thoroughly in this. If cooking is to continue on top of 
stove, leave meat in the kettle. For oven finishing, transfer to 
casserole or baking dish. Season, add a small amount of water 
or tomato juice and simmer. Pot roast is the most familiar 
braised meat. 

Frying and Sauteing — ^Some meats, such as chops and cut- 
lets, may be crumbed and fried in deep fat. Ham, liver and 
some other meats are sometimes sauteed in a small amount of 
fat at low temperature, after the first searing. 

Pressure Cooking — ^utilizes live steam in a special kettle. 

FiRELESS Cooking — continues cooking with no additional 
heat. 

Cooking Glands and Organs — All glandular organs re- 
quire careful cooking at low temperature. Overcooking 
toughens them and destroys their delicate flavor, making them 
almost tasteless. 

Beef 

BROWNED BEEF BRISKET 

6 pounds beef brisket 6 or more medium- sized 

Celery salt boiled potatoes 

Garlic Salt and pepper 

If the piece has much bone, part may be removed for soup, 
stock, or gravy to be used with the meat when warmed over. 
Simmer the solid part of the meat in a little water until tender, 



MEAT 235 

with a dash of celery salt and garlic added, turning it once dur- 
ing the cooking, which will take not less than three hours for 
the amount given. Remove the meat from the liquor; place 
it in a shallow pan with skin side up, and score several times 
across the top. Have boiled potatoes (hot or cold) in readi- 
ness and drop them into the kettle to take up some of the fat; 
then place them around the meat and brown all in a hot oven 
(400° -450° F.) about ten to twenty minutes. Make a gravy 
with the remaining liquor and serve separately. The meat 
should slice as firmly as cheese and be tender and appetizing. 

BRISKET OF BEEF 

3 pounds beef brisket l/^ cup diced celery with 

1/^ cup sliced onions leaves 

1^ cup sliced carrots 1^ teaspoons salt 

Cover beef with hot water, add vegetables and simmer, cov- 
ered, until meat is tender, about 2^ to 3 hours. Do not boil. 
Add salt when half done and more water if necessary. Remove 
meat from broth, slice and serve with Horse-radish Sauce (page 
324) or Onion Sauce (page 315). Allow J/z pound per serving. 

Variations — 1. Brown meat in hot fat before cooking. 

2. With Navy Beans — Soak 1 pound navy beans in water 
overnight. Drain and place in a kettle together with Yz teaspoon 
mustard, Yz cup brown sugar, J/2 cup maple sirup, salt and 
pepper. Place beef brisket on top. Cover with water and cook 
slowly until tender, about 3 hours. 

3. Omit vegetables listed. For the last hour of cooking add 
1 quart sauerkraut, 1 cup vinegar and 3 tablespoons brown 
sugar. Cover and finish cooking. Stir in a grated uncooked 
potato 10 minutes before serving. 

TO CORN BEEF 

Neck, brisket and navel are usually used. Rub the beef with 
salt and pack it in a clean hard wood barrel or crock. Pour 
over it the following picklcj enough for twenty-five pounds. 

2V2 pounds salt J4 ounce saltpeter 

Vz pound sugar 4^4 quarts water 

Mix the pickle thoroughly, boil it, remove the scum, and 
cool the liquid. Place a heavy weight on top of the meat to 



236 

keep it in the brine. The meat may be left in the brine for a 
month, but it is at its best after ten days of curing. 

BOILED CORNED BEEF 

6 pounds corned beef 1 onion 

1 carrot Vinegar 

Butter 

Soak the meat one hour in cold water. Drain, put into a 
kettle with carrot and onion, using enough cold water to cover 
well. Add to each quart of water one teaspoon of vinegar. 
Simmer until tender. Thirty to forty minutes for each pound 
is a fair allowance of time. Let it remain in the liquor twenty 
minutes after it is done. Then drain and serve. Butter rubbed 
over the meat just before serving improves corned beef pre- 
pared in this way. 

OLD-FASHIONED BOILED DINNER 



6 pounds corned-beef 


4 carrots 


brisket 


6 potatoes 


1 cabbage 


6 beets 


3 white turnips 


Vinegar 



Put the meat into the pot over a brisk fire with enough cold 
water to cover it. Bring it rapidly just to the boiling-point, 
then remove the scum, reduce the heat and simmer until tender 
(three to four hours). About three-fourths of an hour before 
it is to be served, skim the liquid free from fat. Put a portion 
of the liquid into another kettle with the cabbage which has 
been cleaned and cut into sections, the turnips, carrots, potatoes 
and beets prepared and cut into uniform pieces, and boil until 
tender. 

BEEF STEW WITH DUMPLINGS 

1/4 pounds shank, neck, 1 small onion 

plate, flank, rump or Y^ cup cubed carrots 

brisket ^ cup cubed turnips 

54 cup flour 4 cups potatoes, cut in 

1 Yz teaspoons salt quarters 

54 teaspoon pepper 

"Wipe meat, remove from bone, cut in cubes of about one and 
one-half inch. Mix flour with salt and pepper and dredge the 



MEAT 237 

cubes of meat with it. Cut some of the fat from the meat 
and heat in a frying-pan. When part of the fat has tried out, 
add the cubes of meat and brown the surface, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent burning. Put this meat, with the melted 
fat in which it was browned, into the stew-kettle. Add enough 
boiling water to cover the meat or a pint of tomatoes, stewed 
and strained, and simmer until the meat is tender (about three 
hours) . 

The carrots and turnips are to be added during the last hour 
of cooking, and the potatoes twenty minutes before serving 
time. Fifteen minutes before serving time, add the dumplings 
to the stew. 

Dumplings — No. 1. 

2 cups sifted flour 1 egg, well beaten 

1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons melted butter 

4 teaspoons baking powder or other shortening 

y^ teaspoon pepper Milk (about % cup) 

Sift dry ingredients together. Add egg, melted shortening 
and enough milk to make a moist, stiff batter. Drop by tea- 
spoons into boiling liquid. Cover very closely and cook for 18 
minutes. Makes 2 dozen dumplings. 

These dumplings may be steamed in another kettle, as in fol- 
lowing recipe. 

No. 2. 

2 cups flour 1 teaspoon salt 

4 teaspoons baking-powder ^ cup milk 

Yz tablespoon fat 

Sift together the dry ingredients and rub in the fat. Add 
enough milk to moisten the flour, but do not make the mixture 
too wet. Roll out the dough on a board, making it about one 
inch thick, and cut with a biscuit cutter. Put the pieces on a 
plate in a steamer and steam twenty to thirty minutes. It is 
better not to steam the dumplings over the stew, as the rapid 
boiling required reduces the gravy too much. These dumplings 
may be cooked on top of the stew, as in the recipe above, but 
they will be lighter if steamed. 



BRAISED SHORT RIBS 

3 pounds short ribs of beef Salt 

Flour Pepper 

1 cup water 

Cut meat into serving portions. Dredge with flour and brown 
in a hot kettle or oven. Season with salt and pepper, add water, 
cover and cook in kettle at simmering temperature or in a slow 
oven (300°F.) until tender, 1 ^ to 2 hours. Allow ^ pound 
per serving. 

Variations — Use Barbecue Sauce (page 253) for water. 

2. Spread prepared mustard over ribs and use tomatoes or 
tomato juice in place of water. 

3. Add sauerkraut during the last 45 minutes of cooking. 

4. Add uncooked pared potatoes, carrots and onions to the 
ribs about 45 minutes before ribs are done. 



BEEF GOULASH 

3 pounds beef chuck 1 teaspoon salt 

Vinegar Yz teaspoon paprika

y^ cup fat 

Cook the onions slowly in the fat. Cut the beef into cubes 
or slices and sprinkle with vinegar and a little savory. Add the 
salt and paprika. Add the cooked onions, cover tightly, and 
simmer for about two hours. The liquid may be increased 
just before serving by the addition of a little beef stock, or 
cream, either sweet or sour. 

SAVORY BEEF 

2 pounds beef, plate, shank, % teaspoon ground cloves and 
rump or round thyme or Summer savory 

3 large onions, sliced 1 ' pint brown stock or boiling

1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon catchup 

54 teaspoon black pepper 

Brown the onions slowly in the fat. Increase the heat. Cut 
meat into sizes desired for serving, add it to the onions, and 
brown. Mix the flour and the dry seasonings. Sprinkle this 



MEAT 239 

mixture over the meat. Add the stock, vinegar and catchup. 
Cover closely. Simmer until meat is tender, allowing at least 
two hours for shank or plate and one and one-half hours for 
rump or round. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF 

4 pounds chuck, round or 3 tablespoons fat 

rump of beef . Salt and pepper 

y^ cup flour 1/2 cup water

meat mallet. Heat the fat and brown the meat in it. Add the 
onions, green pepper, boiling water and tomato. Cover closely. 
Simmer for 2 hours. This may be cooked in a casserole in a 
moderate oven (3 50°F.) about 1 to lYz hours. Vegetables may 
be added as desired. Serves 6. 

STUFFED STEAK 

2 pounds flank or round steak 1 tablespoon chopped onion 

1 cup crumbs 1 small turnip, diced 

Yz cwp stock or water Yz cup chopped celery 

1 teaspoon salt 1 small carrot, diced 

Y4 teaspoon pepper Flour 

The meat should be cut from one-half inch to one inch thick. 
"Wipe the steak, remove the skin and lay the meat out flat on 
a board. Make a dressing of the crumbs, stock or water, salt, 
pepper, chopped onion and a small amount of celery and spread 
it on the meat. Roll the steak with the grain, so that when it 
is cut it may be cut across the grain of the meat. Place the 
diced vegetables in a roasting-pan and on them lay the rolled 
steak. Add two or three cups of water, depending upon the 
size of the pan. Cover and bake in a slow oven (3 50° F.) for 
three hours, or until tender. 

If you prefer to cook this meat on top of the stove, melt one- 
half cup of suet in the bottom of a flat-bottomed iron or 
heavy aluminum kettle, flour the meat thickly and lay the roll 
in the kettle. Turn from side to side until it is well browned, 
then add hot water nearly to cover, and simmer slowly for 
three hours. 

When the meat is cooked, remove it from the kettle or roast- 
ing-pan and thicken the broth, using one to two tablespoons of 
flour to each cup of gravy. 

BRAISED OX-TAIL 

1 ox- tail (cut in two-inch 2 tablespoons flour 
pieces) 1 cup hot water 

2 tablespoons fat 1 cup tomatoes 
2 small onions 3 bay-leaves 

1 carrot 3 whole cloves 

1 tablespoon chopped celery Salt and pepper 

Saute the pieces of ox-tail in the fat. Add the sliced onionj 
and carrot and the chopped celery, and brown all together. 



MEAT 241 

Sprinkle with browned flour. Add the hot water, tomatoes, 
bay-leaves, cloves, salt and pepper. Put into a casserole and 
cook slowly (350° F.) until the meat falls from the bones. 

BRAISED BEEF 

2' to 3 pounds brisket or 1 chopped onion 

round of beef 1 chopped carrot 

Drippings or other fat for 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 

sauteing Yz cup diced celery 

2 tablespoons butter or other 1 cup canned tomatoes 

fat Salt and paprika 

Cut the meat into cubes; brown in hot frying-pan with 
drippings. Stir the meat so it will cook quickly and not lose 
its juices. Tender cuts can be cooked whole. Remove the 
pieces to a closely covered kettle that can be used either on top 
of the range or in the oven. Rinse the pan with a quarter cup 
of boiling water to save all browned bits, and pour this over 
the meat. Cover tightly and cook slowly for two hours. 

For the Sauce, melt butter or other fat and brown the 
onion and carrot in it. Add parsley, celery and tomatoes. 
Heat thoroughly. Add seasonings. Pour the sauce over the 
meat and continue cooking for another hour. 



BEEFSTEAK PIE 

2 pounds rump, flank or Sliced potatoes 

chuck steak Butter or other fat 

Pie paste Flour 

Chopped onion Egg 

Salt and pepper 

Cut the meat into strips two inches long by one inch wide. 
Put them with the bone, just cover them with water and sim- 
mer about an hour. Line the sides of a baking-dish with pie 
paste; put in a layer of meat with a few thin slices of onion, 
and sprinkle with salt and pepper; next add a layer of sliced 
potatoes, with bits of butter dotted over it. Alternate the steak 
and potato layers until the dish is full. Thicken the gravy 
with browned flour and pour in, put on a top crust, brush it 
with beaten egg and bake at 450° F. until quite brown — about 
thirty minutes.

ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING 

In preparing beef for roasting, trim it carefully then skewer 
and tie it into shape. Rub the lean parts with drippings and 
rub the whole with salt, pepper and flour. 

Place the standing or rolled rib roast fat side up in an open 
roasting pan. Then the roast will baste itself. Insert meat 
thermometer so that bulb reaches the center of the largest 
muscle, taking care that it does not rest on the fat or bone. 
Roast in a slow oven (300-3 50° F.) or, if a brov/n crust is 
wanted, start in hot oven (500° F.) for 20 minutes, then reduce 
to 300° F. until done as desired. The thermometer will read 
140° F. for rare, 160° F. for medium, 170° F. for well done. 
The time per pound needed is 18-22 minutes for rare; 22-25 for 
medium and 27-30 for well done. For making gravy, see page 
314. 

Yorkshire Pudding — 

1 cup flour 1 cup milk 

Y2 teaspoon salt 2 t%%s 

Put flour, salt, milk and eggs together in a bowl. Beat well 
with a rotary egg-beater. Pour drippings to the depth of one 
inch into a shallow pan. Have the drippings hot and pour in 
the mixture quickly. Bake for one-half hour in a hot oven 
(400° -42 5° F.). The pudding may then be placed under the 
trivet that holds the roast beef and left for about fifteen min- 
utes to catch the gravy that flows from the roast. If a trivet 
is not used, cut the pudding into squares and lay them around 
the roast in the pan. Serve the pudding with the beef. 

FILLET MIGNON 

Beef fillet Salt and pepper 

Salt pork Flour 

Butter or other fat 

The fillet is the under side of the loin of beef, the tenderloin. 
The skin and fat should be removed with a sharp knife, and 
also every shred of muscle and ligament. If the fillet is not 
then of a good round shape, skewer it until it is so. Lard the 
upper surface with strips of fat salt pork and rub the entire 
surface with soft butter or other fat. Dredge well with salt, 
pepper and flour, and place the fillet, without water, in a small

used. Cut the meat into two-inch cubes and place them in a 
kettle with the onion, salt and pepper, and just enough hot 
water to cover them. Simmer until the meat is tender, about 
an hour usually being sufficient. Strips of salt pork are some- 
times cooked with the veal and add much to the flavor. Half 
an hour before serving, add the potatoes^ cut in halves, and 
cook them with the meat. 

Place dumplings around the edge of a platter and with a 
skimmer lift the meat and potato from the kettle and lay them 
in the center. Thicken the gravy in the kettle with a little

of the d&sh. Put in the meat, dredge it with flour, add fat and 
seasor^ing, and nearly cover with the stock in which the meat 
was cooked. Cover with paste. Bake thirty minutes in a quick 
oven (450° F.). If one-half pound of good salt pork or ham 
is cut in thin slices and parboiled with the veal, a nice flavor is 
added and very little, if any, butter need then be used, nor is 
any other salt necessary. Hard-cooked eggs cut in slices and 
arranged in layers on the veal and ham are an addition to this 
dish. When serving, lift the inverted cup and let the gravy 
flow back into the dish.

MEAT 251 

ROAST VEAL 

4 pounds veal Flour 

Salt and pepper Fat or salt pork or bacon 

A roast may be cut from the leg, the loin, the rack, or the 
shoulder, or the breast may be boned for a roast. A fillet of 
five or six pounds from the heaviest part is the most economical 
for roasting. If the leg is used, it should be boned at the market, 
and the bone should be used for stock. Stuffing improves many 
roasts of veal (see recipes below). 

Wipe the meat, dredge with salt, pepper and flour and place 
it in a pan with some fat. Place in a slow oven (300° F.) and 
roast uncovered and without adding water until tender. Allow 
2 5 to 30 minutes per pound. If desired make an incision in meat 
and insert a roast meat thermometer so that the bulb reaches 
the center of the fleshiest part. When the thermometer registers 
170° F. the veal will be well done. Allow about J/3 pound per 
serving.

into a long shape like a flap. Line it with slices of boiled ham and 
hard-cooked eggs. Remove all the skin and fat from the kidney, 
chop fine and mix with bread crumbs, thyme, parsley, lemon 
rind, salt and pepper. Add beaten egg and blend thoroughly. 
Spread over the veal on top of the sliced ham and eggs. Roll 
the meat and sew or fasten tightly with skewers. Arrange strips 
of salt pork or bacon over roll. Place in a slow oven (300° F.) 
and roast without covering and without adding water until 
tender, 2 5 to 30 minutes per pound. If a meat thermometer is 
used it will register 170° F. when meat is well done. Allow ]/} 
pound per serving. Serve with brown gravy. This is delicious 
served cold. Garnish with spiced peaches or apricot halves in 
pineapple rings.

FRIED HAM WITH CREAM GRAVY 

1 pound ham in slices 1 cup milk 

about Yz inch thick Pepper 

1 tablespoon flour 

If the ham is too salt, place it in a frying-pan, cover with 
cold water and set the pan on a range in mild heat. When the 
steam commences to rise, pour off the water and add more cold 
water. As soon as this water steams, lift out the slices of meat 
and drain well before frying. Place the meat in a hot pan, 
and cook without addition of fat, unless the ham is exception- 
ally lean; in this case, a spoonful of drippings should be used. 
When the ham is nicely browned, place it on a platter, and 
add a cup of milk to the fat in the pan. When this boils, 
thicken it to a cream with one or two tablespoons of flour mixed 
to a smooth paste with a little cold milk, season with pepper, 
then turn the gravy over the ham. A more sim.ple gravy is 
made by adding a little hot water to the fat in the pan and 
pouring this over the meat. 



FRIED HAM AND EGGS 

Fry a slice of ham, browning both sides. Break each eg^ 
separately in a saucer and slip into the hot fat in the frying- 
pan. Lower the heat, and baste with the hot fat. As soon as 
the color changes, they are done. Place them on top of the 
ham and send to the table hot. ^ _ 

SAUSAGES 

1 pound sausage 1 cup milk

When cooking sausage in casings, prick the skins thoroughly 
with a steel fork to prevent their brusting. If cooking in bulk, 
shape the sausage meat into balls with the hands. Place them 
in a hot frying-pan and fry until brown, adding no fat, as 
there will generally be plenty in the meat. When done, re- 
move the sausage to a platter. Pour off all but one tablespoon 
of fat, add one tablespoon of dry flour and cook one minute, 
stirring all the time; then gradually add one cup of milk, still 
stirring. When the gravy is boiling and is of a creamy con-

2 cups boiling water Bit of bay leaf 

Small sprig of thyme 

Buy liver in solid piece, wash thoroughly, dry and lard with 
strips of fat pork (page 3). Cut lean salt pork in pieces and 
try out slightly; add liver and brown on all sides. Add hot 
water, vegetables and seasonings, cover and bake in moderate 
oven (350° F.) until liver is tender, or about 1 hour for veal 
liver and 2 hours for beef liver. Serve on hot platter surrounded 
by vegetables. Approximate yield: 8 portions. 

SAVORY LIVER 

\y2 pounds beef liver, sliced 2 tablespoons flour 

thin % teaspoon salt 

1^ cup chopped onion Dash pepper 

2 teaspoons chopped parsley 3 tablespoons vinegar 

2 tablespoons butter 2]/^ cups bouillon 

Saute onion and parsley in butter in frying pan until lightly 
browned; stir in flour, seasonings and vinegar, and add bouillon 
gradually, stirring and cooking until well mixed. Place liver 
in gravy and cook, covered 1 5 minutes, turning once. 

REINDEER 

Government breeding of reindeer has brought the meat back 
on the market in modern form. It is shipped frozen and may be 
thawed at low temperature or put directly under the broiler or 
in the oven, when additional time for cooking must be allowed. 
It is very much like beef or veal, with less fat, and has a pleas-» 
ant gamy flavor. The round is the desirable cut and steaks, 
pot roast, oven roaet, chops and cutlets are prepared like beef 
or veal except that they need larding more often. 



POULTRY AND GAME 



TJOULTRY includes all the domesticated birds that are used 
-^ for food — chicken and fowl, turkeys, squabs and pigeons, 
geese and ducks. Game includes wild birds — ducks, geese, 
partridge, reed birds, quail, plover, etc., and animals suitable 
for food which are pursued and taken in field or forest, as the 
deer, moose and rabbit. 

The flesh of game, except that of partridge and quail, is dark 
in color and has a fine strong flavor. The flesh of wild birds, 
except that of wild ducks and geese, contains less fat than the 
flesh of poultry. 

Seasons for Fresh Poultry and Game 

Poultry in some form is available in the market at every 
season. Chickens weighing about one and one-half pounds, 
known as Spring chickens or broilers, begin to appear in the 
market during January. The height of the season for broilers, 
however, is May and June. The so-called milk-fed or early 
Spring chickens appear in the market in July and are available 
until August. 

Roasting chickens begin to appear in September, and Phila- 
delphia capons come into the market at about the same time. 
Fowl are in the market now-a-days throughout the year. 

The season for turkey and ducks is the same as for chickens. 

Goose about twelve weeks old, known as green goose, is 
available from May to September. Geese, also, may be found in 
the market throughout the year. 

Fresh quail and partridge are in the market from Oct. 15 to 
Jan. 1. Cold-storage birds may be found much later. Grouse 
is fresh in the Fall. The cold-storage birds are obtainable 
throughout the year. Plover are in season from April to Sep- 
tember. 

Selecting Poultry and Game 

There are a few general rules to be observed in the selection 
of young tender poultry and game. 

They should be plump in appearance, haVe smooth, soft legs 
and feet and smooth, moist skin. 

274 



POULTRY AND GAME 275 

The lower or rear end of the breast-bone should be flexible, 
the skin should be easily broken when twisted between the 
thumb and finger, and the joint of the wing should yield 
readily when turned backward. 

The eyes should be bright, the comb red, and there should 
be an abundance of pin feathers. 

Birds with a yellow skin are likely to be plump, those with 
white skins are likely to be tender. 

Bruised, dry or purplish skin is an indication of careless 
dressing and of age. Hard, dry, scaly legs, hard breast-bone 
and the presence of long hairs are all signs of an old and tough 
bird. 

Avoid birds with a full crop. Buy dry-picked poultry when- 
ever possible. Scalding the bird before plucking it impairs the 
flavor. 

Poultry and game unless they are in cold storage, should not 
be kept long uncooked. They should be drawn as soon as pur- 
chased, and should be kept in a cool place. 

Unless hen turkeys are young, small and plump, cock turkeys 
are more satisfactory. 

Geese should have an abundance of pin-feathers, soft feet 
and pliable bills. 

There is more meat in proportion to the amount of bone in 
fowls weighing five to six pounds than there is in smaller birds. 
Broilers should weigh one to two pounds. 

To Clean and Dress Poultry 

Cut off the head and remove the pin- feathers with a sharp, 
pointed knife. Singe by holding the bird over a flame, turning 
on all sides until all down and hair have been burnt off. 

If the feet and tendons were not removed at the market, cut 
through the skin around the lower joint or "drum-stick," one 
and one-half inches below the joint that connects the foot with 
the leg, but do not cut the tendons. Place the leg with this 
cut at the edge of the table and break the bone by pressing 
downward. Hold the bird in the left hand and with the right 
pull off the foot, and with it the tendons. In an old bird, the 
tendons must be removed one by one with a skewer or trussing 
needle. 



276 



To Prepare Poultry for Cooking Whole 

Make a small incision below the breast-bone. Insert the hand 
and carefully loosen the internal organs, the entrails, the giz- 
zard, the heart and the liver. Reserve the last three; these are 
known as the giblets. Care should be taken not to break the 
gall bladder, which is attached to the liver. The liquid content 
of the gall bladder is very bitter, and makes the flesh unpleasant 
to eat. 

Remove and discard the lungs and the kidneys. Insert two 
fingers under the skin close to the neck and remove the wind- 
pipe and the crop. Pull back the skin of the neck and cut off 
the neck close to the body, leaving enough of the neck skin 
to fold down under the back if the bird is to be roasted. Re- 
move the oil bag from the tail. 

Clean the inside of the bird by running water through it and 
wipe the outside with a damp cloth. 

To Stuff Poultry or Game — ^Fill the opening at the neck 
end with sufficient stuffing to make the bird look plump. Put 
the remaining stuffing in the body. If the body is full, sew 
up the opening; if not full, bring the skin together with a 
skewer. Do not fill the cavity too full. Allowance must be 
made for swelling of the stuffing especially when the stuffing 
is made with cracker-crumbs. 

To Truss Poultry or Game for Roasting — Clean, dress 
and stuff. Tie a piece of twine to the end of the neck -skin and 
pull the neck-skin over the back. Slip the ends of the wings 
over the back and press the wings close to the body. Press the 
thighs close to the body, draw the ends of the twine back on 
each side and up over the thighs. Cross the twine between 
the legs, and tie it down under the tail. 

If the poultry or game has little fat it should be larded with 
thin strips of salt pork or bacon laid across the breast. To pre- 
vent the burning of the legs, wind them with strips of cloth 
which have been dipped in melted fat. 

To Dress Birds for Broiling, Frying, Etc. 

For Broiling — Singe the bird, cut off the head and neck 
close to the breast and the legs at the knee joints. Beginning 
at the neck, make a cut through the back-bone for the entire

length of the bird. Lay the bird open and remove the contents. 
Cut the tendons or break the joints. Cut out the rib-bones and 
remove the breast-bone, to faciUtate carving. 

To Make Fillets — Remove the skin from the breast and 
with a sharp knife make an incision close to the breast-bone, 
beginning at the end next the wish-bone and cutting through 
the entire length. Following the bone closely, remove all the 
meat, cutting it away from the wing joint. This fillet may 
be separated into two parts, the upper or larger muscle making 
the "large fillet" and the smaller *'fillet mignon." 

To Cut Up a Fowl — Remove pin-feathers, singe the fowl, 
cut off the head, tendons and oil-bag. 

Cut off the legs at the thigh joint. Separate the first joint 
or drumstick from the thigh. 

Cut the wings from the body. Cut off the tips of the wings. 

Separate the breast from the back by cutting clear down both 
sides of the bird below the ribs. 

Remove the heart, liver, gizzard, entrails and fat all together. 
Remove windpipe and crop. Carefully remove the lungs and 
kidneys from the back-bone. 

Cut back and breast into two pieces each, cutting crosswise. 
The back is sometimes further divided by cutting lengthwise. 
The wish-bone may be removed by inserting a knife under the 
tip and cutting downward, the knife following the bone. 

To Clean Giblets 

Cut the fat and membrane from the gizzard. Make a gash 
in the thickest part, cutting to, but not through the inner lin- 
ing. Remove the inner sac and throw it away. Carefully 
separate the gall bladder from the liver and cut off any part of 
the liver that has a greenish color. Remove arteries and veins 
from the top of the heart and squeeze out the clot of blood.

stuffing, chestnut stuffing and celery stuffing are particularly 
good. Truss and tie the fowl. Brush skin with melted or soft- 
ened fat. Turn breast side down and cover bird with a cloth 
dipped in fat. Place in a moderate oven (325° to 350° F.). Cook 
uncovered breast side down about one half the total time. Turn 
breast side up. Place any strips of body fat removed in dressing 
over breastbone. Bacon or salt pork strips may be used. Baste 
with extra fat. The cloth may be removed toward the end of 
the cooking if the bird is not well browned. Allow 30 minutes 
per pound for small birds; 22 to 25 minutes per pound for 
larger birds. 

BROILED CHICKEN 

Unless you are quite certain the chickens are tender, it is 
wise to steam them before broiling. This may be done as fol- 
lows: Set the dripping-pan in a moderate oven (3 50°-400° 
F.) and nearly fill it with boiling water. Place two sticks across 
the pan, extending from side to side, and upon them lay the 
chicken. Invert a tin pan over it, shut the oven door and let 
the chicken steam slowly for thirty minutes. This process 
relaxes the muscles and makes the joints supple, besides preserv- 
ing the juices that would be lost in parboiling. 

Transfer the chicken from this vapor bath to a wire broiler, 
turning the inside to the fire first. Broil until the chicken is 
tender and brown, turning it frequently. If the chicken is 
small, it will cook in twenty minutes or less. Do not have too 
hot a fire. Lay the chicken on a warmed platter, spread it with 
butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve. 

PANNED CHICKEN 

1 chicken Salt and pepper 

y^ cup fat 1 tablespoon cracker or 

Flour bread-crumbs 

1 cup hot milk Onion-juice 

Cress Chopped parsley or tarragon 

Prepare a chicken as for broiling and slightly flatten it with a 
rolling-pin. Place in pan, lay bits of fat upon it, and place it 
in a moderate oven (350° F.) allowing 15 to 20 minutes per 
pound. Bake uncovered. Baste with drippings every half 
hour. When it is nearly done, remove from the oven, salt 



POULTRY AND GAME 279 

and pepper both sides, strew once more with bits of fat, dredge 
with flour and return to the oven to brown slightly on both 
sides, the under side first. 

When the chicken is thoroughly done, place it on a hot 
platter with the skin side uppermost, cover, and set it where 
it will be kept warm. Pour hot milk into the pan and add 
cracker or bread-crumbs. Season with salt and pepper, if neces- 
sary, and add a few drops of onion-juice or a teaspoon of 
chopped parsley or tarragon, as preferred. Stir the gravy 
vigorously, let it boil one minute and turn it over the chicken. 
Garnish with cress or parsley and serve. 

CHICKEN, MARYLAND STYLE 

2 chickens 1 cup milk or cream 

Flour Yz cup butter or other mild 
Salt and pepper fat 

Bread-crumbs 2 eggs 

Clean and disjoint young chickens, leaving the breasts whole. 
Put the necks and giblets into cold water and simmer to obtain 
a cup of stock for the gravy. Sprinkle each piece of chicken 
with salt and pepper, dip in flour, beaten q^% and soft crumbs 
and place in a greased pan. Bake in a hot oven (480° F.) 
from thirty to forty minutes, basting frequently with one- 
fourth cup of fat melted in one- fourth cup of hot water. 

When the chicken is done, make a gravy from the fat left 
in the pan, stirring in two tablespoons of flour, one cup of milk 
or cream and the cup of stock made from the giblets. If you 
like, add a few button mushrooms. Serve the chicken with the 
gravy poured around it. 

PLANKED CHICKEN 

2 large broilers 1 teaspoon minced onion 

^ cup fat Salt and pepper 

1 teaspoon minced parsley 1 pint sauted mushrooms 

1 teaspoon minced green 1 quart seasoned mashed 

pepper potato 

1 teaspoon lemon-juice Garnishes for plank 

Make a savory fat by rubbing the minced parsley, green 
pepper and onion into the fat. Flavor with lemon-juice, salt 
and pepper. Split the broilers, sprinkle with salt and pepper 



28o 

and put in a pan. Pour over them a little oil or melted fat and 
bake them (400° F.) until nearly done (about twenty min- 
utes). 

Prepare a plank of proper size, oil it, garnish with a border 
of potatoes forced through pastry-bag and tube, place the 
chicken in the center of the plank, arrange around it sauted 
mushrooms and spread over the chicken the savory fat. Place 
the plank in a very hot oven (500° F.) to brown the potato 
border and to give the chicken the final cooking. Planked 
dishes are invariably served on the plank. They may be 
elaborately garnished with stuffed tomatoes, green peppers and 
fancifully cut vegetables. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

No. 1 — Southern Style 

2 smaH chickens Flour 

Salt and pepper Yi cup fat 

Cut each chicken into four or six pieces, dip each piece 
quickly in cold water, then sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 
roll in plenty of flour. Saute the chicken in a little fat until 
each piece is brown on both sides, and admits a fork easily. Drain 
the pieces well and arrange on a warm platter, setting the dish 
in a hot place to keep the meat from cooling while the gravy 
is being made, as on page 279. 

No. 2— 

Dip the chicken into fritter batter and fry in deep fat 
(375°-390° F.) until brown. Transfer to a casserole or baking 
dish and bake in a moderate oven (250° F.-3 50° F.) for 30-60 
minutes. If the chicken is not young, parboiling before cutting 
will shorten the baking time. 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

2 small chickens or 1 large one 2 or more tablespoons fat 

Salt and pepper Flour 

This is one of the most delicious ways of cooking chicken. 
Take off the neck and split the chicken down the back, wiping 
it with a damp towel. Season inside and out with salt and 
pepper, and dredge on all sides with flour. Lay the chicken, 



POULTRY AND GAME 281 

with the inside down, in a small baking-tin, and add a very- 
little water. The pan should be very little larger than the 
chickens, otherwise the gravy will be too quickly evaporated. 
Set into a rather slow oven (300°-350° F.) and cook for one 
hour in a covered baking-pan or, if baked without a cover, 
baste every ten minutes after the first twenty minutes. 

Should the chicken be decidedly lacking in fat, add fat as 
needed. When done, place the chicken on a hot platter, add 
enough water to make two cups gravy and thicken with two 
tablespoons flour. Should the chicken be quite fat, remove all 
but two tablespoons of the oil from the pan before making the 
gravy. Season with salt and pepper, pour it over the chicken 
and serve at once. 

BOILED CHICKEN 

In Winter there is no better way to prepare chickens than 
to simmer them whole and pour over them oyster or parsley 
sauce. The chicken should be well secured in a wet cloth that 
has been generously sprinkled with flour, then plunged into 
boiling water and simmered (not boiled) gently until the 
chicken is done. Allow twenty to thirty minutes to each pound 
of chicken. A large, tough chicken may be made very palatable 
by preparing it in this way. 

STEAMED CHICKEN OR FOWL 

1 fowl (about 5 pounds) Salt and pepper 

1 onion Flour 

1 bay-leaf 

A chicken is more tender than a fowl and is to be preferred 
for light cooking, but a fat fowl a year or two old has a richer 
and finer flavor, and if steamed properly, will be perfectly 
tender. Singe and wash the fowl, draw and dress it as carefully 
as for roasting and wipe it dry inside and out. Rub it inside 
and out with salt and pepper, place an onion and a bay-leaf 
inside and tie the fowl into shape as for roasting. 

Then flour a cloth and wrap it about the fowl. Lay the 
chicken, back downward, in a steamer and allow it to steam 
continuously for three to four hours, according to its age and 
size. If properly steamed it will be as good as a roasted chicken. 
Serve with celery, oyster or parsley sauce. Steamed chicken 
may subsequently be browned in the oven if desired. 



282 



STEAMED WHOLE SPRING CHICKEN 

1 chicken Salt and pepper 

1 cup oysters Yz cup cream or milk 

1 tablespoon fat 3 hard-cooked eggs 

1 tablespoon flour Minced herbs 

Prepare a full-grown Spring chicken as for roasting, season 
inside and out with salt and pepper, stuff with whole, raw 
oysters and place it in a steamer with a close-fitting cover, and 
steam until the chicken is done, then place the chicken on a 
warm dish and make a gravy as follows: Put the fat into a 
saucepan with the minced herbs and flour and stir until the 
mixture bubbles; add the liquor in the kettle below the steamer, 
the cream or milk, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mix- 
ture boils. Add the eggs, chopped fine, let the whole boil, pour 
it over the chicken and serve at once. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE 

1 chicken 1 teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons flour 1 cup milk 

Salt and pepper 

Clean, singe and cut up the chicken, place it in a pot and 
nearly cover with water. Cover the pot and simmer gently. 
An old fowl will require at least three or four hours' slow cook- 
ing, but a year-old chicken should be done in one and one- 
half hours. Remove the cover during the last half-hour of 
cooking, to reduce the gravy to about one and one-half pints 
when done. 

Three-fourths of an hour before time to serve, make Dump- 
lings No. 2 (see Index). When the dumplings are ready to 
serve, add salt and pepper to the chicken and make the gravy 
by adding to the liquor in the kettle three tablespoons of flour 
stirred to a paste in one cup of milk. Skim out the chicken, 
lay it on a platter, place the dumplings on the top and pour 
over them the gravy.' 

PRESSED CHICKEN 

1 chicken 1 tablespoon gelatin to each 

Salt and pepper pint broth 

Clean, singe and cut up a chicken. Place it in a kettle with 
a little water, cover closely and simmer until the meat will fall 



POULTRY AND GAME 283 

from the bones. Lift the pieces from the kettle with a skimmer 
and scrape all the meat from the bones, separating the white 
meat from the dark and taking out the pieces of skin. Season 
with salt and pepper. 

Soften gelatin in two tablespoons of water for each tablespoon 
of gelatin and add to the boiling chicken broth. Place the meat 
in the dish it is to be pressed in, laying the white and dark in 
alternate layers, and adding from time to time a little of the 
broth to moisten all well. When all the meat is in the dish,^ 
pour over it enough of the broth to cover it; lay a plate on top 
of it; place a heavy weight upon the plate and set away in a 
cool place. This makes an attractive dish for luncheon, sliced 
and garnished with parsley. 

White FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN 

1 chicken 1 egg-yolk 

2 tablespoons fat Salt and pepper 
2 cups chicken stock Herbs 

2 tablespoons flour Salt pork 

1 cup milk or cream Rice or dumplings 

Singe, clean and cup up the chicken. Brown in a pan with 
the fat. Cover with boiling water, add salt, pepper, herbs and 
a few slices of salt pork. Simmer until tender (about an hour) , 
strain and thicken one pint of the liquor with the flour mixed 
to a smooth paste with a little cold water; add the milk or 
cream beaten with the yolk of the egg. Heat again until 
slightly thickened, pour over the chicken and serve with rice 
or dumplings (see Index for recipe). 

Brown 

1 chicken Salt and pepper 

2 or 3 small slices salt pork 1 teaspoon onion-juice, if 
2 tablespoons flour desired 

1 pint boiling water 

Cut in pieces as directed for white fricassee. Place salt pork 
in a frying-pan, and when hot put in the chicken, leaving 
plenty of room to turn the meat; cook until each piece is a 
rich brown. Remove the chicken and keep it warm. Add the 
flour to the fat in the pan, stir well and when it has cooked two 
minutes, add the boifing water. When the gravy is smooth 
and boiling, replace the chicken, season with salt and pepper. 



284 

cover the pan, and simmer gently until the chicken is tender, 
then add a teaspoon of onion-juice, if desired, and serve at 
once. The gravy will be thick enough, and if the pan has a 
tight cover, it will not be diminished, even after long cooking. 

CHICKEN PIE 

1 chicken Salt and pepper 

Pie paste Flour 

Milk 

Clean, singe and cut up chicken as for fricassee. Place in a 
kettle and add enough hot water to cover. Put the cover on 
the kettle, and simmer slowly until the chicken is tender, add- 
ing a little more water if needed. Make a gravy of the stock, 
using two tablespoons flour for each cup of stock. Use for the 
crust puff paste, or a good pie paste, rolled a little thicker 
than for fruit pies. Line the sides of a deep baking-dish with 
crust; invert in the middle of the dish a small cup or ramekin; 
put in part of the chicken and season with salt and pepper, 
then add the rest of the chicken, and season the same way. 

Put in the dish two cups or more of the gravy made from 
broth in which the chicken was cooked and cover the top with 
crust. The cup or ramekin will hold the crust up and will pre- 
vent evaporation. Most chicken pie is too dry; therefore, use 
a generous amount of the broth. Bake in a hot oven (450° F.) 
until crust is done (one-half hour) . "When serving, after cut- 
ting the first slice, carefully slip the knife under the ramekin 
and release the gravy which is held there by suction. Additional 
gravy should be served in a gravy-dish. 

CURRY OF CHICKEN 

1 chicken ( 1 ^ or 2 pounds) 2 tablespoons fat 

1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons 

2 onions curry-powder 

1 egg-yolk 1 tablespoon flour 

Cut up the chicken as for fricassee, put in a saucepan with 
sufficient water to cover it, and simmer until tender, keeping 
the pan closely covered. Remove from the fire, take the chicken 
out and pour the liquor into a bowl. Put the onions into the 
saucepan with the fat and saute until brown, then skim them 
out and put in the chicken ; fry for three or four minutes, then 



POULTRY AND GAME 285 

sprinkle over it the curry-powder. Next pour in the chicken 
liquor, stew five minutes longer and stir in the flour mixed 
until smooth with a little cold water. Stir the mixture until 
it thickens; add the beaten yolk of egg, adding a little of the 
hot mixture to the egg first. Serve with a border of hot boiled 
rice. 

SAVORY CHICKEN 

% cup fat lYz cups strained tomatoes 

1 tablespoon chopped onion Salt, pepper and paprika 

1 chopped carrot 1 chicken 

1 slice turnip Salt-pork fat 

5/4 cup flour 1 cup button mushrooms 

1 cup water 2 tablespoons chopped olives 

Make a savory sauce by melting the fat and cooking in it 
chopped onion, carrot and turnip cut in small pieces. Stir in 
flour and add gradually boiling water and tomato, previously 
stewed and strained. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. 

Cut up a chicken, dredge with flour, and saute in salt-pork 
fat. Remove from the pan, place in a saucepan and cover 
with the savory sauce. Cook until the chicken is tender. At 
the last moment, add the mushrooms and chopped olives. Ar- 
range the pieces of chicken in the center of the platter and pour 
the sauce around them, garnishing with triangles of toast and 
stuffed olives. 



SCALLOPED CHICKEN 

2 cups cooked chicken meat 2 tablespoons flour 

1 pint broth in which chicken Salt and pepper 

was cooked Bread-crumbs 

Fat 2 cups sliced, cooked potatoes 

Cut the cooked chicken meat into dice. Thicken the broth 
with a paste made of the flour and two tablespoons of fat and 
season with salt and pepper. Fill a pudding-dish with alternate 
layers of bread-crumbs, chicken and potatoes. Cover the top 
with crumbs. Pour in the gravy and add a few bits of butter 
or other fat and bake fifteen to thirty minutes in a moderate 
oven (3 50°-400° R). 



286 



CREAMED CHICKEN 

2 cups cooked chicken Salt and pepper 

2 tablespoons fat 1 tablespoon parsley 

2 tablespoons flour 1 egg-yolk 

1 cup milk or cream 

Make a white sauce of the fat, flour and milk. Season with 
salt and pepper. Add the parsley and chicken and cook until 
the sauce is thoroughly hot again. Beat the egg-yolk, adding 
two tablespoons of milk, and pour into the mixture. Cook 
two minutes, stirring constantly, and serve in a border of riced 
potatoes or in croustades. 

Creamed chicken may be varied in a number of ways: by 
substituting mushrooms or chopped cooked eggs for part of 
the chicken or by adding chopped pimientos and olives. 



Capons 

Capons are large, plump young roosters, especially fattened 
for the table. They are prepared for cooking in the same way 
as chickens. For stufl&ng, choose a delicate flavoring such as 
oysters or chestnuts. Mushrooms or truffles are especially good 
with capon. 

Turkeys 

ROAST TURKEY 

Dress as directed for roast chicken and roast in an uncovered 
roaster in a slow oven (300° F.) allowing 15 to 25 minutes per 
pound, depending upon age and size of bird. The larger birds 
require less time per pound than the small birds. Baste the bird 
at half hour intervals. Serve with giblet gravy. 

BRAISED TURKEY 

1 turkey ^ cup onion 

Stuffing Yz cup turnip 

Yz pound salt pork 4 cups water or stock 

Yz cup chopped celery Salt and pepper 
Yz cup chopped carrots 

This is a very satisfactory way of cooking an old turkey that 
is unfit for roasting. StuflF the body and breast with any de- 



POULTRY AND GAME 287 

sired stuffing, and truss. Spread thin slices of salt pork over 
the breast and legs, and cover the turkey with a strong sheet 
of oiled paper, fastening the paper on by passing a string 
around the body. In a double roasting-pan large enough to 
hold the turkey, spread sliced salt pork and the chopped vege- 
tables. Lay the turkey on this mixture, with the breast up, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover the pan tightly, and place 
in a moderate oven (350°-400° F.). Allow twenty-five min- 
utes for each pound. 

At the end of thirty minutes, add water or stock. During 
the last half -hour take the cover from the pan, remove the paper 
and pork from the turkey. This permits the meat to brown 
lightly. Serve with mushroom sauce, or with the gravy in the 
pan, strained and thickened.

Egg and crumbs Salt and pepper 

1 cup white stock 2 teaspoons butter 

1 cup rice 1 tablespoon grated cheese 

6 tablespoons oil 

Skin the breast of a plump turkey, and sKce. The slices 
should be nearly half an inch thick, and as nearly uniform in 
size as possible. Dip in beaten q^^, then in crumbs, again in the 
Qg^, and once more in the crumbs. Set in the refrigerator. Put 
the white stock into a saucepan; add rice, onion-juice and 
one-half teaspoon salt^ and simmer slowly until the liquid is 
absorbed. 

When the rice is tender, add butter and grated cheese,^ and 
season with salt and pepper. Cover and let it stand at the 
side of the fire until the fillets are ready. Heat salad-oil or 
cooking fat slowly in a frying-pan to 375°-390° F., and cook 
the fillets to a nice brown. Mound the rice in the center of a 
hot dish and arrange the fillets about it. 

BROILED YOUNG TURKEY 

Young turkeys may be broiled or panned, like chickens. A 
young turkey is easily distinguished by its smooth, black legs 
and white skin.

TURKEY CURRY 

6 tablespoons fat 3 tablespoons flour 

]/3 cup onion, finely chopped 1/^ teaspoon salt 

1 large apple, peeled, diced 1 to ll/^ teaspoons curry 
1 large can mushrooms or powder 

1 pound fresh mushrooms 1 1/^ cups turkey stock and top 
3 cups turkey, diced milk, or cream 

Cook onion, apple, mushrooms, and turkey in the fat until 
onion and apple begin to be transparent: 10 to 15 minutes. If 
fresh mushrooms are used, saute several minutes before adding 
to other ingredients. Remove from heat, add salt, flour, and 
curry powder and stir thoroughly. Add liquid, and cook until 
thickened throughout. Set over hot water, cover and cook 15 
minutes longer to blend the flavors. Taste and add more 
seasoning if desired. Serve with hot boiled rice. Little or no 
salt is added in cooking rice. 



Goose 
ROAST GOOSE WITH POTATO STUFFING 

1 goose (about 8 pounds) Salt and pepper 

Potato stuffing Flour 

Salt pork if goose is not fat 

Select a goose that is about four months old. An old goose 
is better braised than roasted. Singe the goose, wash it carefully 
in hot water, and wipe it dry on the outside; then draw it and 
clean it thoroughly inside. Flatten the breast-bone by striking 
it with a rolling-pin. Partly fill the cavity with potato stuf- 
fing, stitch up the openings and truss the goose. If it is not 
fat, lay thin slices of pork upon the breast, but if the goose has 
considerable fat, omit the pork. Bake in a hot oven (500° F.) 
for forty-five minutes. Remove it from the oven, pour out 
all the fat, sprinkle the bird all over with salt and pepper, 
dredge with flour, and return it to the oven. Reduce the heat 
but do not let it get below 3 50° F. 

When the flour is a good brown, pour one cup of hot water 
into the pan and baste the goose often, dredging it each time 



POULTRY AND GAME 289 

with a slight sifting of flour to absorb the fat. Allow twenty 
minutes to the pound for a young goose and twenty-five for 
one that is old. Remove the goose from the pan, add a cup 
of hot water to the gravy and thicken it, if necessary, with 
browned flour. Garnish the goose with parsley and serve with 
giblet gravy. 

Apple sauce is often served with roast goose. 

Goslings may be roasted in the same way, allowing, however, 
only fifteen minutes to the pound for cooking. 

ROAST GOOSE WITH BAKED APPLE 

1 eight-pound goose 1 teaspoon salt 

2 cups bread-crumbs Pinch of pepper 

1 chopped onion 6 to 8 apples 

2 tablespoons fat 54 cup brown sugar 
y^ teaspoon sage 3 sweet potatoes 

Cook the giblets until tender, chop and add to stuffing made 
by mixing bread-crumbs, onion, fat, sage, salt and pepper. 
After cleaning and washing the goose thoroughly, stuff, and sew 
the neck and back. Roast for fifteen minutes at 500° F., then 
reduce the heat to 3 50° F. and cook about three hours. Wash 
and core six to eight apples; sprinkle with brown sugar, stuff 
with mashed and seasoned sweet potato; bake until tender and 
serve hot with the goose. 

DEVILED GOOSE 

1 goose 1 teaspoon pepper 

Potato stuffing 2 tablespoons made mustard 

J4 cup vinegar 1 tablespoon salt 

After cleaning the goose and wiping it well with a damp 
cloth, plunge it into a kettle of boiling water, and simmer for 
one hour. Take it from the kettle, drain well, and wipe it dry. 
Partly fill the body and neck with potato stuffing, sew up and 
truss, and roast in a moderately hot oven (3 50° -400° F.), al- 
lowing fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound. Pour over it 
a mixture of the vinegar, pepper, and made mustard, and baste 
frequently. Serve with giblet gravy. 

An old goose that can not be made eatable in any other way 
may be cooked in this way, two hours instead of one hour 
being allowed for the simmering.

Ducks 
ROAST DUCK 

Epicures prefer young ducks rare, and without stuffing. 
Some people consider that ducks have too strong a flavor, and 
to absorb this flavor lay cored and quartered apples inside the 
body. These apples are removed before the duck is sent to the 
table. Celery and onions also may be placed inside the duck to 
season it and improve the flavor, two tablespoons of chopped 
onion being used to every cup of chopped celery, which may 
consist of the green stalks that are not desired for the table. 
This stuffing is also removed from the bird before it is sent to 
the table. Should filling be preferred, use potato stuffing, put- 
ting it in very hot. 

Truss the duck, sprinkle it with salt, pepper and flour, and 
roast in a very hot oven (500° F.) fifteen to thirty minutes, 
provided the duck is young and is desired rare. 

Full-grown domestic ducks are roasted in a moderate oven 
(350° F.) allowing 20 to 25 minutes per pound. Bake uncov- 
ered. Baste every half hour with drippings in pan. Serve with 
giblet gravy and applesauce or grape or currant jelly. Green 
peas should also be served with roast duck. 

BRAISED DUCKS 

1 brace ducks Parsley 

3 slices bacon Salt and pepper 

1 carrot 1 small turnip, diced 

1 onion stuck with cloves Oil or cooking fat 

Thyme Flour 

Prepare ducks as for roasting, put them into a large stew- 
pan with the bacon, carrot, onion and a little thyme and 
parsley; season with salt and pepper and cover with water. 
Simmer over a low fire until the ducks are tender, then remove 
them from the pan. Cook the turnip in the fat until brown, 
then drain and cook in liquor in the stew-pan, until tender. 
Strain the liquor, thicken with flour and pour the gravy thus 
made over the ducks. Garnish with pieces of turnip.

DUCK A LA CREOLE 

2 cups cooked duck Salt and pepper 

2 tablespoons fat Paprika 

1 tablespoon flour lYz cups consomme or 

2 tablespoons chopped ham bouillon 
2 tablespoons onion 1 clove 
Chopped celery %, teaspoon mace 
Chopped pars-ley Chopped sweet pepper 

Melt the fat and add the flour, then stir in the ham. Season 
with salt, pepper, paprika, onion, celery, sweet pepper and 
parsley. Stir for two minutes, add the consomme or bouillon, 
the clove and mace. Simmer one hour. Strain this sauce and 
stir in the cooked duck, cut into cubes. Cook just enough 
longer to heat all thoroughly. Serve with diamonds of fried 
hominy or mush. 

Guinea Fowls 

ROAST GUINEA FOWL 

Roast the guinea fowl either with or without stuffing, keep- 
ing it well basted and the breast covered with a slice of fat 
bacon, which may be removed five minutes before serving. 
Have the oven very hot (500° F.) for the first fifteen minutes; 
then reduce to 3 50° F. Allow thirty-five to forty minutes for 
a medium-sized bird. Serve with currant jelly and giblet sauce. 

FRICASSEE OF GUINEA FOWL 

1 guinea fowl 1 teaspoon salt 

4 slices bacon ^ teaspoon pepper 

2 tablespoons flour 

A guinea fowl makes a delicious fricassee. Clean and cut 
in pieces. Place bacon in pan and when it has fried long enough 
to extract some of the fat, add the pieces of the fowl and brown 
them well. Add the flour, stir until thoroughly mixed, and 
then add two cups hot water, salt and pepper, and stir until 
the gravy boils. Cover well and simmer until the meat is 
tender, which is generally in one and one-half to two hours. 
Serve with the gravy from the bottom of the pan, adding more 
salt and pepper if needed. 



292 



Peafowl 

These fowls are cooked in the same way as turkeys. They 
should be larded with shreds of bacon, trussed and roasted about 
one and one-fourth hours. 



Pheasants, Partridges, Quail and Grouse 

Game should not be kept too long; birds rarely should be 
hung longer than one week. Hang in a cool dry room where 
the air circulates freely. If birds are to be kept many days, 
draw but do not pick them before hanging. Place a piece of 
charcoal in the body and sift powdered charcoal into the 
feathers. A distinction must be made between white meat 
and dark meat in cooking game. Quail and partridges are 
white meat and, like chicken, must be thoroughly cooked but 
not dried. Ducks, pigeons or squabs, grouse (prairie chicken) , 
snipe, and woodcock are dark meat and are preferred by the 
epicure cooked rare and served very hot. 

The methods of cooking all these birds are substantially the 
same, except as to the degree of rareness desired. They should 
never be washed, but simply wiped with a damp towel, all shot 
being carefully picked out of the flesh with a sharp-pointed 
knife. Small birds are often skinned when the birds are 
cleaned. There is a difference of opinion among epicures as to 
the drawing of these birds ; sometimes they are cooked undrawn. 
The English do not draw woodcock, regarding the entrails as 
edible, and some American housekeepers copy them in this 
respect. 

BROILED BIRDS 

Clean the birds and split them down the back. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dust with flour to keep in the juices and broil 
in a wire broiler, laying the inside first to the fire. Allow about 
ten minutes for quail, twenty-five to forty minutes for par- 
tridges and pheasants. When done, lay them on a warm dish 
and butter or oil them plentifully on both sides. During the 
broiling, if the breasts are quite thick, cover the broiler with 
a pan, and see that the fire is not too hot. 



POULTRY AND GAME 293 

PANNED BIRDS 

Clean the birds and split them down the back. Dip them 
quickly into hot water and sprinkle with salt, pepper and flour. 
The water causes the seasoning to adhere more thickly to the 
meat. Place the birds in a small baking-dish with the inside of 
each upward; place a teaspoon of butter or other fat in each 
bird, add a cup of water, and roast in a very hot oven (500° F.) 
allowing fifteen to twenty minutes for quail and proportion- 
ately longer for larger birds. After the first fifteen minutes re- 
duce the heat to 3 50° F. Baste every five minutes after the first 
fifteen. Thicken the gravy, add salt and pepper if necessary, 
and pour over the birds. 

ROASTED BIRDS 

Clean, truss and stuff the birds. Roast in an uncovered 
pan in a moderate oven (350° F.) until meat is tender and bird 
is well browned. Baste every half hour with butter or other 
fat and water. Thicken the gravy and pour it over the birds. 
Serve with bread sauce. 



LARDED GROUSE 

Grouse are rather dry birds and need to be larded to be palat- 
able. Clean and wipe with a damp towel. On each bird lay 
thin slices of bacon, covering the bird entirely and keeping the 
bacon in place with crossings of soft twine. Place in a roasting- 
pan and pour over them boiling water, sufficient to use for bast- 
ing the birds while cooking. Cook in a very hot oven (500° F.) 
fifteen to twenty-five minutes, basting three times. Reduce 
the heat after fifteen minutes. When done, remove the strips 
of bacon, brush the birds with oil, melted butter or other fat, 
dredge with flour and place in the oven again until a rich brown. 
The liquor in the pan may be thickened, seasoned, and used as 
a gravy. Arrange the birds on a platter and garnish with rings 
of sauted green peppers and the strips of bacon used to cover 
the birds while roasting.

ROAST QUAIL 

6 quail Flour 

6 large oysters Salt and pepper 

Strips of bacon Butter or other fat 

Dress, clean and truss the birds. Stuff each with one large 
oyster. Lard breast and legs with strips of bacon. Bake as di- 
rected for larded grouse, allowing fifteen to twenty minutes for 
cooking. 

GAME PIE 

6 birds 2 tablespoons browned flour 

Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons fat 

^ cup minced parsley 2 cups diced potatoes 

Yz chopped onion Rich paste for side and top 

2 whole cloves crust 

54 pound diced salt pork 

Clean the birds thoroughly. Halve them, put them into one 
quart of water and bring to boiling-point. Remove the scum, 
add salt, pepper, parsley, onion, cloves and salt pork. Simmer 
until tender, carefully keeping the birds covered with water. 
When the birds are done, thicken the liquid with the browned 
flour and let the gravy come to a boil. Add the fat, remove 
from the fire and cool. 

Put the paste around the sides of a greased pudding-dish, lay 
In some of the birds, then some potatoes, and repeat until the 
dish is full. Pour in the gravy, put on the top crust, slashed 
in the center, and bake in a hot oven (450° F. to 425° F.) for 
thirty-five to forty-five minutes until done. 

Pigeons and Squabs 

Pigeons need long, slow cooking to make them tender. 
Squabs are tender and are usually broiled. 

BROILED SQUAB 

6 squabs Butter 

Salt and pepper Toast 

Split the birds down the back, flatten the breast, wipe inside 
and out with a damp cloth. Put on a broiler, season with pepper 
and salt, and when nicely browned, pour a generous amount 
of melted butter over them. Serve on toast.

Clean and cut pigeons into small portions and let them cook 
a short time in the fat in a saucepan, being careful not to 
brown them. Next add to the contents of the pan the stock 
or gravy, the mushroom catchup, and salt, pepper and cayenne 
to taste. Simmer an hour, or until tender, add the mushrooms, 
simmer ten minutes more, and then stir in the cream. Arrange 
the mushrooms around the pigeons on a hot platter. 

POTTED PIGEONS 

6 pigeons Chopped parsley

Clean and dress pigeons, stuff, truss, and place them upright 
in a stew-pan on the slices of bacon. Add the carrot, onion, 
and a little parsley, and cover with boiling water or stock 
Cover the pot closely and let simmer from two to three hours, 
or until tender, adding boiling water or stock when necessary. 
Make a sauce of the fat and flour and two cups of the stock 
remaining in the pan. 

Serve each pigeon on a thin piece of moistened toast, and pour 
gravy over all. 

PIGEON PIE 

6 pigeons Flour 

Bread stuffing Rich pie paste 

Salt and pepper 3 hard-cooked eggs 

Fat 

StuflF each pigeon with bread stuffing. Loosen the joints with 
a knife, but do not cut them through. Simmer the birds in 
a stew-pan, with water enough to cover, until nearly tender, 
then season with salt and pepper. Make a medium thick gravy 
with flour, fat and liquor in which pigeons have cooked and 



296 

let it cool. Line the sides of a greased pudding-dish with rich 
paste and cut the hard-cooked eggs in sHces. Put successive 
layers of egg, pigeon and gravy into the dish until it is filled, 
put on a cover of paste and bake (at 450° F.) for one-half 
hour. 

wad Ducks 

Nearly all wild ducks are likely to have a fishy flavor, and 
when dressed by an inexperienced cook are often unfit to eat. 
This flavor may be much lessened by placing in each duck a 
small peeled carrot, plunging the fowls in boiling water and 
simmering them for ten minutes before roasting. The carrot 
will absorb some of the unpleasant taste. An onion will have 
somewhat the same effect, but unless a stuffing with onions is 
used, the carrot is to be preferred. When there is an objection 
to parboiling (as when the ducks are young) rub them lightly 
with an onion cut in two and put three or four uncooked cran- 
berries in each before cooking. 



ROAST WILD DUCK 

Clean, wiping inside and outside with a damp towel. Tuck 
back the wings, and truss. Dust with salt, pepper and flour. 
If not fat, cover the breast with two thin slices of salt pork. 
Place duck in a baking-pan, and add one cup of water, and 
two tablespoons of fat. Bake in a very hot oven (500° F.) 
from fifteen to thirty minutes, according to rareness desired, 
basting frequently. Reduce the heat after fifteen minutes. 
Serve with slices of lemon or orange and a brown gravy or 
with olive sauce. Currant jelly may also be served. Wild 
ducks are served rare and are seldom stuffed when roasted. 
An old saying is that a young wild duck to be well cooked 
should only fly through a very hot oven. 



CANVASBACK DUCK, DELMONICO STYLE 

This bird is in season from the last of November until March. 
As it feeds mainly on wild celery, it requires no spices in cook- 
ing. Its flavor is best preserved by roasting quickly in a very

POULTRY AND GAME 297 

hot oven (500° F.) so that it will be brown on the outside 
and underdone on the inside. Dress it in the usual way and 
wipe with a wet towel. Truss its head under the wing, place in 
a dripping-pan and roast one-half hour, or twenty minutes if 
liked underdone, basting often. Reduce the heat after fifteen 
minutes. Season with salt and pepper and pour over it the 
gravy in the baking-dish. 

MALLARD WILD DUCK 

These ducks, in season during the Fall and Winter, are very 
dry when roasted. They are good if stuffed with bread stuffing-, 
then well sewed up, tied in shape and placed in a large kettle 
with a couple of slices of onion, a little thyme, and a small 
quantity of water and cooked slowly for one hour. Turn the 
bird frequently during the cooking; replenish the water if 
necessary, but use only enough to keep the ducks from burn- 
ing. Make a gravy from the juices in the kettle by adding one 
cup of water and thickening with flour. Pour this gravy over 
the ducks when served. Dressed in this way all parts are 
equally good. 

Venison 

Venison is prepared and cooked in the same way as mutton. 
The roasting pieces are the saddle and the leg. It should be 
served underdone, allowing ten to twelve minutes to the pound, 
for cooking, and served with tart jelly and green salad. 

ROAST LEG OF VENISON 

Leg of venison % cup fat 

Fat salt pork Flour 

Salt and pepper 

Wipe carefully, and draw off the dry skin. Lard the lean 
side of the leg with strips of the pork, then soften the fat, rub 
it over the meat, and dredge with salt, pepper and flour. Lay 
the leg on the rack in a baking-pan, sprinkle the bottom of the 
pan with flour, place it in a very hot oven (500° F.) and 
watch carefully until the flour in the pan is browned, which 
should be in £Lve minutes. Add boiling water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan Baste the venison v/ell every fifteen minutes, 



298 

until the meat is done, renewing the water in the pan as often 
as necessary. Reduce the heat after fifteen minutes. If a double 
roasting-pan is used, basting is not necessary. 

Most tastes require at least an hour and three-quarters for 
cooking a ten-pound roast; but if the meat is liked very rare, 
allow only an hour and a quarter. Serve with a gravy made 
from the juices in the bottom of the pan. Always serve a tart 
jelly like currant or wild grape or plum jelly with venison. 

BROILED VENISON STEAK 

Venison steak Currant jelly 

Salt and paprika Possibly salad oil and

This requires about three minutes more time for broiling 
than beefsteak. If strong, marinate in salad oil and lemon- 
juice for two hours before cooking. Drain without wiping, 
and broil over clear, hot coals, turning often to avoid scorch- 
ing. Serve on a very hot platter, sprinkle with salt and paprika 
and spread both sides with a mixture of butter and currant 
jelly, allowing half as much jelly as butter. 

FRIED VENISON STEAK

warm. Dredge two teaspoons of flour into the fat in the pan 
and stir until brown (but not burned), add a cup of boiling 
water with one tablespoon of currant jelly dissolved in it, stir 
a few minutes, strain the gravy, pour it over the meat and 
serve. 

Rabbits, Hares and Squirrels 

Choose rabbits with soft ears and paws — stiffness is a sign of 
age. Also, be sure that they are fresh and free from any un- 
pleasant odor. Neither hares nor rabbits should be drawn be- 
fore hanging, as they may become musty. In Winter, select a 
dry place for hanging, and they may remain for some time. 



POULTRY AND GAME 299 



Dressing and Trussing 

To skin and dress a rabbit, hare or squirrel, cut off the fore 
feet at the first joint, cut the skin around the first joint of the 
hind leg, loosen it and then with a sharp knife slit the skin on 
the under side of the leg at the tail. Loosen the skin and turn 
it back until it is removed from the hind legs. Tie the hind 
legs together and hang the rabbit to a hook by this fastening. 
Draw the skin over the head, slipping out the fore legs when 
they are reached. Cut off the head and thus remove the entire 
skin. Wipe with a damp cloth. Remove the entrails, saving 
heart and liver, and wipe carefully inside. If it requires wash- 
ing inside, use water acidified with vinegar. 

Before cooking, soak in tepid water for a time. If blood has 
settled in any part, cut with the point of a knife where it is 
black and soak in warm water; this will draw out the blood. 

Skewer firmly between the shoulders, draw the legs close 
to the body and fasten with skewers. 

ROAST HARE OR RABBIT 

Hare or rabbit Salt and pepper 

Forcemeat or stuffing Beef -drippings or other fat 

Wipe the hare or rabbit dry, fill it with good forcemeat or 
stuffing, sew up and firmly truss it. Season well with salt and 
pepper and roast. Baste well with beef-drippings, butter 
or other fat. A thin piece of beef-suet skin may be tied over 
the back for the first three-quarters of an hour and then re- 
moved. One and three-quarters hours is the full time for roast- 
ing a medium-sized hare at 500° F. for the first fifteen minutes 
and 3 50° F. for the rest of the time. Serve with brown gravy 
and currant jelly. 

BROILED HARE OR RABBIT 

Hare or rabbit Butter 

Salt and pepper 

Skin and clean the rabbit or hare, wipe dry, split down the 
back, and pound flat; then wrap in oiled paper. Any tough 
white paper may be oiled. Place on a greased gridiron and 
broil over a clear, brisk fire, turning often. Remove the paper 



300 

and serve on a hot platter, seasoned with plenty of salt, pepper 
and butter, turning over and over so it will take up the fat. j 
The oiled paper is not essential but results in a juicier product. \

STUFFINGS FOR FISH, MEAT. 
POULTRY AND GAME 



QTUFFING does not necessarily have to be baked in the fowl 
^ or meat. If the bird is small or if there is some stuffing left 
over, it may be baked or steamed in a well-greased ring mold, 
loaf pan or individual molds. Fill center of ring with vegetables. 
Croquettes of stuffing, made by the usual method, are served in 
a circle around the bird.

SAUCES FOR FISH, MEAT, 

POULTRY, GAME, AND 

VEGETABLES 



SAUCES add variety to the diet, make foods more attractive 
to the eye and to the palate, and thus stimulate appetite, 
aid digestion and improve nutrition. 



WHITE AND BROWN SAUCES 

Methods of combining flour or corn-starch with liquids are 
given in the front of the book. (See Index.) The simplest 
method of thickening sauces is by means of a roux. Equal parts 
of fat and flour make the best roux. If much more fat than 
flour is used, the fat rises to the top of the mixture. If less fat 
than flour is used, the paste may burn. Therefore, if more fat 
than flour is required in the sauce, it should be beaten in in small 
pieces after the liquid is added and just before the sauce is 
served; if less fat than flour is required, it is better not to make 
it into a roux but to use another method of thickening the 
sauce. 

All sauces thickened with corn-starch should be cooked for at 
least fifteen minutes. Standing over hot water in a double 
boiler for an hour or longer improves the flavor. Sauces 
thickened with flour are better if cooked for at least five minutes 
after thickening. The seasonings should be added just before 
the sauce is served. 

To Make a Roux 

For a White Sauce — The American method of making a 
roux for white sauce is to melt the fat, add the flour and cook 
only until the, mixture bubbles before adding the liquid. This 
saves time, but at the expense of the flavor of the sauce. The 
French method is to melt the fat, add the flour and cook, with 
constant stirring, for £.Ye minutes, before; adding any liquid. 
This removes the raw taste of the flour. 

For a Brown Sauce — Melt the fat and allow it to brown 

307

before adding flour, then stir in the flour and stir constantly, 
until the flour is brown. The color depends on this browning, 
but care must be taken not to scorch This long preliminary 
cooking is the secret of a successful brown sauce. Tomato juice 
or sauce may be used as liquid.

ENTREES AND MADE-OVER 
DISHES 



AN entree is a dish that is served as an independent course 
between two main courses of a meal. In an informal meal, 
an entree of protein food may be served as the main course. 

An entree is usually a "light" dish, small in bulk, and is often 
accompanied by a sauce which may or may not be an integral 
part of the dish. It may be served either hot or cold. Hot 
entrees are often accompanied by a hot sauce, such as Hol- 
landaise or maitre d'hotel; and cold entrees by cold sauces, 
— vinaigrette, tartar, etc. Ordinarily the hot entree precedes 
the roast and the cold entree follows it. 

Entrees may be made of a great number of foods — eggs in 
many attractive forms; fish of all kinds; meat, such as lamb, 
veal and tender cuts of fowl and beef, cooked by some method 
other than roasting; macaroni and spaghetti; some fruits; and 
many kinds of vegetables. 

Increasingly in America today vegetables are served as 
entrees. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the eating 
habits of the nation have changed, because we have a growing 
knowledge of and interest in the food -values of vegetables and 
fruits. For luncheon and dinner now one vegetable is often 
raised to the dignity of becoming a course by itself. 

Hot Entrees 

Creamed Mixtures — These are the most simple and easily 
prepared of the hot entrees. Any well-seasoned creamed mix- 
ture may be use4. It must be kept hot and transferred at the 
last possible moment to the container in which it is to be served. 
This may be merely a slice of toast, an individual case such 
as a ramekin, patty shell or timbale case, or a border formed 
of bread, rice or potato. 

Forcemeats — ^These should have a smooth^ velvety texture. 
They call for more effort in preparation than any other type of 
entree. They are made of cooked or uncooked meat or fish 
in finely divided form, those made of the uncooked material 
being considered the more choice. Such foods as chicken and 

326 



ENTREES AND MADE-OVER DISHES 327 

ham, shell fish and any fine white fish make typical forcemeats. 
Forcemeats may be use,d in combination with other materials 
or cooked alone to form cutlets and timbales. The cutlets are 
cooked in shallow, chop-shaped molds and the timbales in deep, 
straight sided molds. 

Croquettes — Croquettes are made of cooked and chopped 
ingredients held together, usually, by means of a thick sauce. 
When the mixture is cold, it is made into shapes of uniform 
size, which are coated with flour or sifted crumbs, then rolled 
in an egg mixture so that the egg forms a continuous film, then 
rolled in crumbs again. The egg mixture is made by adding 
two tablespoons of water or milk to each egg required, and beat- 
ing just enough to break up the white of the egg. The cro- 
quettes may be allowed to stand until dry or may be fried at 
once in deep hot fat. This is a good way to use left-over cooked 
foods. 

Croquettes are made In the form of balls, rolls, cones, nests 
or cups, cutlets or flat cakes. Whatever shape is desired, it is 
usually easier to attain it by making the mixture into a ball 
first, thus insuring a compact mass from which the chosen 
form may be readily molded. 

Cutlets — ^This word, as used in this chapter refers to the 
form in which the food is cooked rather than to a distinct type 
of food. Sometimes cutlets are made by packing forcemeat 
into shallow, chop-shaped molds, but more often they are cro- 
quettes, cut or shaped to look like breaded chops or cutlets. 
The term may be extended to include boiled cereal, such as 
rice or cornmeal, which has been packed into a shallow dish, 
left until cold, and then cut into pieces, rolled in egg and crumbs 
and fried or sauted. 

Fritters — ^These may be composed of a piece; of fruit en- 
closed in a batter, then fried in deep hot fat and served with 
an appropriate sauce; or chopped fruit, chopped vegetable, or 
other chopped food, such as dams or lobster, stirred into the 
batter and fried by spoonfuls. 

Timbales — ^This term is sometimes used to describe force- 
meat cooked in straight-sided deep molds. More frequently 
perhaps it refers to sugarless custards cooked in timbale molds. 
In timbales of this type, where egg is the thickening agent, 
savory seasonings are used, and the milk which ordinarily forms 
an important component of custard is replaced in part or en- 
tirely by meat stock or vegetable puree. 



( 



328 

All timbales are cooked in molds of some sort; they are 
cooked by oven-poaching and are not browned. They are 
turned out of the molds before they are served. A circle of 
buttered paper laid in the bottom of the mold before it is filled 
insures perfect unmolding. 

Hot Souffles — These are the lightest of the entrees, being 
made' so by well-beaten egg-white folded into the seasoned 
foundation mixture. This may be simply a fruit puree or 
pulp; it may be a white sauce combined with egg-yolks and 
the characterizing ingredient; or it may be a panada made by 
cooking either cracker or bread-crumbs with milk and adding 
the prepared ingredient, this method being best for meat souffles. 
Souffles need the same careful baking given to egg timbales and 
are served in or from the baking-dish. The top should be 
browned. 

Fillets — ^This type of entree is composed of a solid piece of 
meat or fish, and may comprise breasts or joints of poultry, 
chops, large oysters, scallops, crabs, fillets of fish and the first 
three cuts of beef tenderloin. These when used as entrees, 
may be cooked by broiling, sauteing, frying or oven-poaching, 
but never by roasting because the flavor and effect would be 
too much like that of the main course. 

Vegetable Entrees — ^Hot or Cold 

The following vegetables are suggested for service as en- 
trees: asparagus, cauliflower and broccoli, hot with HoUandaise 
or butter sauce, or cold with vinaigrette; tomato surprise, 
stuffed, for instance, with mushrooms; corn on the cob; mush- 
rooms; baked lima beans; long, thin string beans, not cut or 
split; large beets hollowed out and filled with bread crumbs 
and tiny peas or chopped carrots or both; stuffed peppers; 
egg plant; baked Hubbard squash, Brussels sprouts; braized 
celery or endive; cucumbers; and artichoke bottoms stuffed 
with forcemeat and baked. 

Cold Entrees 

Asi'ics — Aspic is a spiced tart jelly made from brown or 
white meat stock alone or in combination with gelatin. It is 
used to enclose a variety of foods in a mold or to give a trans- 
parent coating of shining, sparkling finish. Various foods may 



4.ir 




ENTREES AND MADE-OVER DISHES 329 

be molded in aspic — for instance, stuffed olives, plain or stuffed 
tomatoes, eggs, birds, beef tongue, chicken salad or a mousse. 

Aspics give ample opportunity to show inventiveness in de- 
sign, for they are usually elaborately decorated. Decorative 
shapes may be cut from pimiento, green or red pepper, olives, 
pickles, hard-cooked egg-white, yellow custard, parsley, truffles 
or cooked vegetables. Green peas and capers, alsoj are fre- 
quently used. 

Chaud Froids — ^For these dishes, the sauce is made up hot 
but the finished product is served cold. The sauce, which 
may be white, yellow or brown, and stiffened with gelatin, 
is used to give a smooth, glossy surface to eggs, cutlets, breast 
or other choice pieces of chicken, fish fillets, etc.^ all of which 
must be plainly cooked and well seasoned. A decoration is 
usual, also a final coating of aspic. 

Mousses — ^This term, used in connection with entrees, refers 
to a dish made of a meat, fish or vegetable puree stiffened 
with gelatin and made light by means of beaten cream. It 
is molded to give it shape, chilled^ then unmolded for serving. 

Cold Souffles — ^It is difficult to differentiate these from the 
mousses. About the only difference is the manner of serving. 
The mixture may be put into individual dishes of china, or 
paper cases, having paper bands pinned about the top to give 
greater height. When the mixture is chilled, the bands are 
removed. The mixture, extending above the edge of the, con- 
tainer, gives the effect of great lightness, thus simulating a 
souffle. 

Salads — Salads are not usually thought of as entrees, but 
in a formal menu are so considered. 



Borders and Cases 

BREAD CROUSTADES 

Cut slices of bread from one to two inches thick. Remove 
the brown part of the crust. Cut each trimmed slice into 
two oblongs or two triangles, for large croustades, or into four 
squares or four triangles, for small croustades. Or shape the 
bread with cookie cutters into circles, diamonds, etc. Insert 
the point @f a sharp knife into the top of the shaped piece, one- 
half inch from the edge, and cut around the outline^ running 



330 

the knife down to within one-half inch of the bottom. Insert 
the knife point horizontally through one side of the slice, one- 
half inch from the bottom, and cut out and remove the center^ 
leaving a box with half-inch walls and bottom. Fry these 
cases in deep fat, (375° -390° F.) or, if you prefer, brush 
them over with melted fat and set them in a moderate oven 
(350°-400° F.) to brown. 

RICE CROUSTADES 

Cook one cup of washed rice in white stock instead of in 
water. Drain well, mix with a thick white sauce, and spread 
in a greased pan to the depth of about two inches. Cover 
with oiled paper and place weights on top, so that the mix- 
ture may become very compact when cold. When it is per- 
fectly firm, cut it in circles,- make a cavity in the center of 
each, dip the case thus made in fine bread-crumbs, then in eggy 
and again in crumbs, and fry in deep fat (375°-390° F.). 

POTATO BORDER 

9 medium-sized potatoes 1 tablespoon salt 

2 tablespoons butter 2 eggs 
Yz cup hot milk 

Boil and rice the potatoes. Add remaining ingredients except 
54 teaspoon salt and the egg whites. Beat the mixture until very 
light. Pack into a border mold, well greased, and set in warm 
place eight minutes. Unmold onto an oven-proof platter. Beat 
egg whites, with remaining salt, to a froth, spread over the 
border and brown in a slow oven (300°-350° F.). 

Potato Timbales — Peel potatoes and cut into tiny strips 
lengthwise. Heat in a small amount of fat until slightly soft — 
don't brown. Remove, sprinkle with salt and arrange nests 
inside large deep muflSn tins, pressing firmly against sides and 
bottom. Bake in hot oven (450° F.) for 15 minutes. Use car- 
rots, parsnips, macaroni, spaghetti or fin« noodles instead of 
potatoes. ^j^^ BORDER 

1 cup rice 2 tablespoons butter or other 

3 cups white stock fat 

1 tablespoon salt 3 tablespoons milk or cream 

2 egg-yolks 

Cook washed rice in white stock for one-half hour, then 
add salt and butter or other fat and cook slowly twenty minutes 



ENTREES AND MADE-OVER DISHES 331 

more. Beat the yolks of the eggs with the cream or milk and 
stir in. Grease a border mold, pack the rice firmly into it, let 
it stand eight to ten minutes in a warm (not hot) place and 
turn out on a hot platter. Fill the center with any meat 
preparation warmed in sauce. 



TIMBALE ROSETTES 

1 egg ^2 cup flour 

10 tablespoons irradiated % teaspoon salt 

evaporated milk l^/^ teaspoons sugar 

Beat ^gg slightly. Add milk. Sift flour, then measure. Re- 
sift with salt and sugar into the ^gg and milk mixture. Stir 
until batter is smooth. It should be about the consistency of 
heavy cream. Use a deep, heart-shaped timbale iron. Dip in the 
hot fat to heat, then in the batter, being careful that the batter 
does not come up over the top of the iron. 

Have ready a small, deep kettle of fat, place the iron in it 
and heat until the fat is hot enough to brown a piece of bread 
while counting sixty (370° F.). The fat should be deep 
enough to cover the mold end of the iron. Take out the heated 
iron, remove surplus fat with a piece of absorbent paper and 
lower the iron into the batter until it is covered not more than 
three-fourths its height. This is necessary to allow for the 
rising of the batter during cooking. If only a thin layer of 
batter adheres to the iron, plunge it in again, and repeat if 
necessary until there is a smooth layer of partly cooked batter. 
Plunge it quickly into the hot fat and cook from two to three 
minutes. Remove from the fat, slip the case from the iron 
on to absorbent paper and continue until you have the required 
number of cases. 

A fluted iron is easier to work with than a plain one, be- 
cause the case does not slip off until thoroughly cooked. A 
properly cooked case, however, should slip easily from the 
mold. If the cases are not crisp, the Datter is too thick and 
should be diluted with milk. 

These cases may be filled with a creamed vegetable, creamed 
oysters, chicken or sweetbreads, or with fresh or cooked fruit 
topped with whipped cream or powdered sugar. When sweet 
fillings are used, they are served as a dessert. This recipe makes 
about 20 cases with an iron of average size. 



332 



RISSOLES 

These are practically little turnovers, filled with a highly- 
seasoned mixture of chopped chicken and ham or other deli- 
cate meat moistened with white sauce. Roll puflF-paste very 
thin and cut in circlfe^. Place a teaspoon of the mixture in the 
center of each circle^ moisten half the circumference with cold 
water, and fold the other half over^ pressing the edges closely 
together. Dip in slightly beaten egg mixed with a tablespoon 
of water. Fry in deep fat (3 60° -370° F.) and drain 
thoroughly. 

BOUCHEES 

iSmall pastry shells or cases filled with creamed meat or game 
are called bouchees, and are much in vogue for entrees. They 
provide an excellent way of utilizing left-overs of chicken, 
sweetbreads, fish, etc. Paper cases, bought at the confectioner's^ 
may be used instead of the pastry shells. 

PATTY CASES 

Roll puff -paste to the thickness of one-half inch and with 
a cookie cutter shape circles two and one-half to three inches 
in diameter. With a tiny cutter, remove the centers from half 
of the circles. Brush the edges of the complete circles with 
water and lay the rings on top. Chill thoroughly? then bake 
in a hot oven (400° -450° F.) from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
At the same time, bake the small centers removed from the 
upper layers of the cases, and use them as lids for the filled 
patties. 

VOL AU VENTS 

A vol au vent is a large patty. The French name signifies 
something that will fly away in the wind. Roll out puff -paste 
one and one-half inches in thickness, and cut a circle about 
six inches in diameter, using a cutter or, with a sharp knife, 
cutting around the edge of a plate laid on the paste. Place the 
circle on a baking-tin andy with a sharp pointed knife or a 
snialler cutter, cut a circle around the top about one and one- 
half inches from the edge and about an inch deep. Do not 
remove the center but bake the entire circle in a large, flat pan 
in a hot oven (450°-500° F.) from thirty to fifty minutes.

in any household where the program of using meat only once 
a day is being followed. Dishes containing a large percentage 
of milk, eggs or cheese, together with dried legumes, nuts or 
gelatin, are nutritious and typical vegetarian dishes. 

People not accustomed to meatless menus may experience 
an unsatisfied feeling at the end of a meal that is entirely 
vegetarian. This is largely due to the fact that meat is a highly 
flavored food. The housewife will do well, therefore, to offer 
some well-seasoned dish in a vegetarian menu. 

A ring mold is a decorative way of serving vegetarian dishes 
with no extra labor. The following recipes calling for a loaf 
form may be used for the ring mold. See page 344. 

CHESTNUT CROQUETTES 

2 cups hot mashed chestnuts Few drops of onion-juice or 
4 tablespoons fat 2 tablespoons minced onion 

2 eggs Egg and crumbs 
Salt and pepper 

Mix the chestnuts, fat, slightly beaten eggs and seasonings. 
Shape into croquettes. Roll in crumbs, then in beaten tgg and 
again in crumbs. Fry in deep hot fat (375° -3 90° F.) until 
crumbs are brown (2-5 minutes). 

This dish offers adequate protein and iron and a compara- 
tively highly seasoned dish. The croquettes may be served 
with brown sauce or tomato sauce. 

PEANUT BALLS 

1 tablespoon fat Pepper 

2 tablespoons flour 2 cups cooked rice 

Yz cup milk 54 c^P ground peanuts 

Yz teaspoon salt 1 egg

352 

balls. Saute in a greased frying-pan turning frequently so that 
the balls are browned all over. Or, roll in beaten Qgg, then in 
crumbs and fry in deep fat (375°-390° F.). 

This dish is low in both iron and protein, therefore milk, 
eggs or cheese should appear elsewhere in the menu. These 
balls are good served with cheese sauce. 

PEANUT SCRAPPLE 

1 cup hot milk 1 ^4 teaspoons salt 

1 quart boiling water Yg teaspoon paprika 

1 cup yellow corn-meal 1 Yz cups chopped peanuts 

^ cup hominy grits ^ to 1 cup grated cheese 

Combine hot milk and boiling water, bring to boiling-point 
and add corn-meal, hominy grits and seasoning. Stir constantly 
until the liquid is thickened by the cere;al. Place in a double 
boiler and cook one hour. Ten minutes before taking up, add 
the peanuts and cheese. 

Place in a deep rectangular bread-pan and allow it to cool. 
When ready to use, cut in small slices (roll in egg and crumbs 
if desired) and fry in deep fat (375° -3 90° F.) until brown 
(2-5 minutes) ; or place in a greased baking-pan, sprinkle with 
grated cheese mixed with bread-crumbs and bake in a moderate 
oven (3 50° -400° F.) until brown. 

This makes an excellent luncheon or supper dish. 

PEANUT BUTTER CUTLETS 

1 Yz cups peanut butter Pepper 

1 /4 cups hot milk 6 half -inch slices of bread 

1 teaspoon salt 

Mix peanut butter with hot milk and seasoning, mixing to-

VEGETARIAN DISHES 353 

move from water and dry. Add oil and mix well. Place the 
mixture in a greased baking-dish and bake (400° F.) until the 
peanuts are soft and well browned. 

If extra seasoning is desired, a small quantity of catchup, 
salt, molasses and mustard may be added during the baking, 
as for baked beans. 



PEANUT SOUFFLE 

1 tablespoon fat Few drops lemon-juice 

6 tablespoons flour 1 ^ cups scalded mlik 

^ cup peanut butter 4 eggs 
lYz teaspoons salt

point. Remove from the fire, pour the, hot mixture over the 
well-beaten egg-yolks, mixing thoroughly. Cool, and fold in 
the egg-whites that have been beaten until stiff and dry. When 
the ingredients are thoroughly combined, place in a ring mold, 
set in a pan of water in a slow oven (375° F.) and bake thirty 
minutes. Serve immediately. 

This is a hearty main dish, but, because of its texture, should 
have something crisp or solid served with it. 



MOCK SAUSAGE 

1 cup dried Lima beans or 3 eggs 

3 cups cooked beans of 2 tablespoons fat 

any kind Yz teaspoon sage 

Yi cup bread-crumbs Salt and pepper 

Pick over and wash beans, cover with water and let soak over 
night. Drain, cook in boiling salted water until tender, then 
force through a strainer. Add remaining ingredients, shape 
into the form of sausages, roll in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again. 
Saute until brown. Serve with tomato sauce. 

This recipe makes six to eight sausages, three inches long and 
thre^e-fourths of an inch thick. It should be accompanied by 
some milk, egg or cheese dish.

EGG DISHES 



TO test an egg for freshness, place it in a glass of water. If 
the egg falls to the bottom of the glass and lies on its side, 
it is a fresh egg; if the large end rises slightly, the egg is 
somewhat stale; if it stands on end or floats, it is very stale. 
The shell of a fresh egg has a bloom; that of a stale egg is usually 
shiny. If the contents of an egg rattle when it is shaken, it is 
not fresh. 

EGGS COOKED IN THE SHELL 

Hard-cooked (Coddled) — Place the eggs in a saucepan of 
cold water and heat slowly until the boiling-point is reached. 
Set the container on the back of the stove or reduce the heat so 
that the water will not boil again and let stand twenty to thirty 
minutes before removing the eggs. Another method of regulat- 
ing the 'temperature is to cook them in the double boiler. 

Soft-cooked (Coddled) — Use one pint water for each egg 
up to six eggs, one-half pint for each additional egg, and use a 
small deep saucepan so that the water will cover the eggs. Bring 
the water to the boiling-point in a vessel that can be covered 
closely. Put the eggs in at once, cover, set off the fire and let 
stand in a warm place for four to six minutes, depending on con- 
sistency desired. In this way, the eggs will be cooked equally 
well in every part. 

POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS 

No. 1 — Heat salted water to the boiling-point in a frying-pan 
or other shallow pan. Break an egg into a saucer, then slip it 
gently into the water. Repeat until all the eggs are in. Re- 
move the pan from the fire, cover and keep hot until the eggs 
are set to the desired degree. If the yolk is not entirely covered, 
dip the water over it carefully until it is coated with white. Re- 
move with a skimmer or perforated ladle and slip on to a thin 
piece of buttered toast. Buttered muffin rings may be placed 
in thei water and each egg slipped into a muflSn ring for cookingj^ 
or an egg-poacher may be used. 

360 



EGG DISHES 361 

Poached eggs are often placed in clear soup, one egg being 
prepared for each person to be served. They are served also on 
thin slices of boiled ham, on mounds of corned-beef hash, on 
Welsh rabbit or on cooked spinach. 

No. 2 — Separate the yolk and white. Beat the white until 
stiff and put it in a glass ramekin. Drop the yolk in the center 
of the beaten white. Set the ramekin in hot water until the 
egg sets. Garnish with a bit of butter and sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. Serve in the ramekin. 

FRIED EGGS 

No. 1 — Heat cooking-fat in a frying-pan and slip in the 
eggs. Cook as many eggs at one time as will fill the pan with- 
out touching one another. Baste with some of the fat, to cook 
the yolk. Cook slowly, for if the fat becomes very hot the eggs 
will be tough and hard to digest but if the temperature of the 
fat is kept down, the egg may be made as delicate as if poached 
in water. 

Eggs may be fried very successfully by covering the pan as 
soon as the eggs have been added, and then placing it in the 
oven or over a very slow fire, so that the eggs will cook very 
slowly. 

No. 2 — ^With Brown Butter — 

6 eggs Salt and pepper 

3 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon vinegar 

Saute the eggs in one tablespoon butter until set, season with 
salt and pepper, and place on a platter. Brown two tablespoons 
butter in the pan, add one teaspoon vinegar, and when hot, pour 
over the eggs. 

BAKED EGGS 

No. 1 — Use individual baking-dishes and melt one teaspoon 
of butter in each dish. Break thei eggs into the dishes, allow- 
ing one or two eggs to a dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and place a tiny piece of butter on each. Bake in a slow oven 
(250°-350° F.) until the eggs are set but not hard. Serve in 
the baking-dishes. 

No. 2 — Shirred — ^Use small ramekins or egg-shirrers. Grease 
each dish, put in a layer of buttered crumbs, break an egg over 
the crumbs, season with salt and pepper and cover with buttered 



36: 

crumbs. Bake in a slow oven (250°-350° F.) until the eggs 
are set and the crumbs brown. Serve in the ramekins. 

No. 3 — On Toast — Moisten the edges of the toast with hot 
water and spread with butter. Separate the yolks and whites 
of the eggs. Poach the yolks in salted water until soft cooked, 
and place one on each slice of toast, being careful not to break 
it. Beat the whites very stiff, spread around the yolks, season 
with salt and pepper, and brown in the oven (350° F.). 

No. 4 — In Tomato Sauce — Grease, small ramekins and place 
two tablespoons thick tomato sauce in each. Slip a poached egg 
into each dish, cover with grated cheese, season with salt and 
pepper, and bake in a very hot ovejn (450°-500° F.) two or 
three minutes, to brown the cheese. 

No. 5 — In Bacon Rings — Curl long slices of bacon around 
the inside of muflfin-cups or small ramekins. Break an egg in- 
side each bacon-ring, season with salt and pepper and bake 
(350° F. ) until set, but not hard. Remove carefully from the 
dish so that the egg will remain fastened to the bacon. Ar- 
range on a platter and garnish with parsley. 

No. 6 — ^WiTH Bacon Strips — ^Fry the bacon very crisp, but 
not hard, then arrange the slices in groups of two on a large 
plate or in individual baking-dishes. Break one egg over each 
two slices of bacon, season with salt and pepper and bake slowly 
(300° F.) until set, but not hard. 

BATTERED OR SCRAMBLED EGGS 

No. 1 — In a frying-pan, place one teaspoon of butter for each 
egg. Beat the eggs until the whites and yolks are well mixed. 
Season with salt and pepper and add one to three tablespoons 
of milk or cream for each egg. Pour into the hot fat and 
cook slowly, stirring constantly until the eggs are of the de- 
sired consistency. Serve at once. A little onion -juice or 
chopped parsley may be added to the eggs, if desired. 

No. 2 — With Green Peppers — 

8 eggs 2 sweet peppers 

3 tablespoons cream 3 tablespoons fat 

Salt and pepper 

Beat the eggs slightly, adding the cream, salt and pepper. 
Heat the fat and add the eggs. As the eggs begin to cook, add 



EGG DISHES 363 

the) chopped pepper, from which the seeds have been removed. 
Cook slowly, stirring constantly, until the mass is creamy. Serve 
with toast points. 

One-fourth cup of chopped canned pimientos may be sub- 
stituted for the pepper. It is often desirable to soften fresh 
peppers by placing in hot water for five minutes. 

Eggs scrambled in the top of a double boiler will be more 
creamy than those cooked in a frying-pan. 



PLAIN OMELET 

Puffy — 

4 eggs Salt and pepper 

4 tablespoons hot water Butter or other fat 

Beat the egg-whites until stiflf. Beat the yolks until thick 
and lemon-colored, beat into them the hot water and add salt 
and pepper. Cut and fold together the; yolks and stiffly beaten 
whites. Melt enough fat in an omelet-pan to grease the bottom 
and sides of the pan. Turn the egg mixture into the pan and 
cook ove,r a slow fire until it is puflFy and a light brown under- 
neath, then place in the oven until the top is dry. Touch the 
top of the omelet lightly with the finger and if the egg does 
not stick to the finger the omelet is done. Do not overcook 
it or it will shrink or be tough. 

Loosen the edges of the omelet, cut through the center, slip 
a spatula or flexible knife under the side next to the handle of 
the pan, fold one-half over the other and press slightly to make 
it stay in place, slip on to a hot plate and serve at once. 

French — 

6 eggs 2 tablespoons fat 

Salt and pepper 

Beat the eggs just enough to mix the whites and yolks, and 
add salt and pepper. Heat the fat in an omelet-pan, pour a 
little of it into the beaten eggs and allow the remainder to get 
hot. Turn the eggs into the pan and as the mixture cooks on 
the bottom and sides, prick it with a fork so that the egg on 
top will pene.trate the cooked surface, and run under the sides. 
The work must be done quickly and carefully so that the eggs 
are not all stirred up like scrambled eggs. While the eggs are 
still soft, but slightly thickened, fold ove;r, let stand a few 
minutes to brown, and turn on to a hot dish.

LITTLE OMELETS 

6 eggs 1/4 teaspoon pepper 

Yz teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 

The following is an excellent method of making an omelet 
when different members of the family come irregularly to 
breakfast, as the mixture^ will be perfectly satisfactory after it 
has stood for some time, provided it is again beaten thoroughly 
just before cooking. 

Beat the eggs until light and foamy, then add the other in- 
gredients. Fry a small amount at a time on a hot frying-pan 
or pancake-griddle that has been well greased. When done^ 
roll each omelet quickly, like a French pancake, and serve.

CHEESE 



CHEESE has an important place in the dietary, for it keeps 
well, it is a concentrated food, and ordinarily it is an 
economical one, at least when compared with other animal foods. 

One pound of cheese represents the fat and protein of a gallon 
of milk. It is one form in which a surplus of milk may be 
stored satisfactorily and cheaply. 

In spite of this, many persons do not use cheese as frequently 
as they should. In large measure, this is because the following 
facts about cheese are not generally known: 

That cheese is a very concentrated food and therefore should 
be eaten in small amounts and should be associated at the same 
meal with bulky foods such as fruits and vegetables. 

That whole-milk cheese is very rich in fat and therefore other 
fats at the meal should be limited in amount. 

That cheese is soft in texture and should be associated with 
something having tough, "chewy" or crisp texture. 

That cheese should take the place of meat or eggs and not be 
used merely as an addition to a meal already he^vy with protein 
and fat. 

Varieties of Cheese 

There is a cheese for every taste. The housekeeper should 
know the ways in which various kinds of cheese are used and 
choose the variety best suited to the need of the moment. The 
intensity of flavor desirable in a cheese depends, among other 
things, on the food with which it will be served. Roque- 
fort, Gorgonzola, Limburger and related types will satisfy many 
people better than the milder cheeses. Strong, old Cheddar 
cheese may be served with ginger snaps. From the chemist's 
standpoint, there is no basis for the statement often made that 
the highly flavored cheeses of strong odor have undergone 
putrefactive decomposition. 

Cheddar, American, or Standard Factory Cheese is the most 
common cheese in use. It is a hard cheese and varies greatly in flavor 
and texture. It may be white or yellow, old or fresh. A mild cheese 
is green and not cured; a strong cheese is old and cured. A Cheddar 
cheese should have a smooth texture and be plastic enough to slice

CHEESE 375 

well. Mold on the outside is no indication of the quality of the 
cheese. Cheddar cheese is useful in general cooking. Unless made 
into special dishes like cheese wafers, it is not so good to serve with 
salads as some cheese of more distinaive flavor. In recipes which 
call for cheese, without specifying the kind, Cheddar cheese is the 
variety meant. 

Long Horn, Young America, Daisy and Flat are Cheddar 
cheeses of varying shapes and sizes. 

California Jack is the Cheddar cheese of CaUfornia. 

Brie is a soft cheese, ripened by molds from the outside. The 
cheeses have a red coloration on the surface and vary in size from six 
to fifteen inches in diameter and from two to three inches in height. 
The largest weighs from five to six pounds. The interior varies in 
consistency from waxy to semi-liquid and has a very pronounced odor 
and a sharp characteristic taste. The cheese is dipped out of the 
container with a spoon. It is used as a dessert with coffee and wafers 
or it may be added to salad dressing. 

Caciocavallo is a hard Italian cheese shaped something like a 
gourd and weighing three to five pounds. It is white in color and 
is so hard that it is necessary to grate it. It is served in small dishes 
to be sprinkled in soup, spaghetti, etc. It is also added to these 
dishes, during the cooking. 

Camembert is a soft cheese, ripened by molds from the outside, so 
it belongs to the same group as Brie. It has a felt-like rind, one- 
sixteenth to one-eighth inch in thickness, composed of molds and 
dried cheese. A typical cheese is about four and one-quarter inches 
in diameter and three-quarters to one inch in thickness. It is sold 
wrapped in paper and enclosed in a wooden box of the same shape. 
Well-ripened cheeses vary from nearly fluid to the consistency of 
moderately soft butter. It is dipped out of the container with a 
spoon. It has a strong odor and flavor and is used in the same way as 
Brie. The entire cheese is eaten by those who like a moldy cheese. 

Cheshire Is the English Cheddar cheese. It is yellow, grainy, 
highly colored and highly salted and often more highly flavored than 
American Cheddar. It is used practically in the same ways as Ameri- 
can Cheddar cheese. 

Cream Cheese. See Neufchatel. 

Club Cheese is usually made from strong, well-ripened Cheddar 
cheese which is ground and mixed with butter and condiments. It 
spreads easily, and therefore is often used in sandwiches. 

Edam is a hard cheese. It is put on the market in the form of 
red balls, weighing from three to four-and-one-half pounds, wrapped 
in tin-foil. Its texture is solid, close and free from pores. It is 
rather dry and crumbly. It is mild in flavor and pleasantly saline. 

It is usual in this country to cut off a section of the top to serve 



( 



Z7^ 

as a lid, and to scoop out the inside as it is needed. It is served with 
salads, with crackers, with pie, etc. The cheese may be set in a silver 
holder or wrapped in a folded napkin on a plate. It is seldom cooked 
but often thrifty housewives, after the greater part of the cheese has 
been removed, stuff the hollow shell with cooked and seasoned maca- 
roni, rice, or something similar and bake it. Edam cheese may be used 
in rarebit. 

GoRGONZOLA is a semi-hard cheese, resembling Roquefort in that it 
is streaked throughout with a blue-green mold. The surface is 
heavily coated with a substance resembling clay. The cheeses are 
cylindrical in shape, about twelve inches in diameter and six inches 
in height. It may be crumbly or waxy in texture, and has a flavor 
resembling that of Roquefort. It is usually served uncooked as des- 
sert, with wafers and coffee, or in salads, or it may be added to the 
salad dressing. 

LiEDERKRANZ is a Small Limburger cheese. 

LiMBURGER is a hard cheese. It is wrapped in waxed paper and then 
in tin-foil. Each cheese weighs about two pounds. It has a very 
strong and characteristic odor and taste. The odor, which is disagree- 
able to some people, may be decreased by removing the rind and ex- 
posing the cheese to the air before bringing it to the table. Because of 
its strong flavor, it is always served uncooked, in sandwiches, with pie, 
or with wafers and coffee. 

Neufchatel and cream cheese are very similar, Neufchatei being 
made from milk containing four per cent, fat and cream cheese from 
milk containing six per cent. fat. Neufchatel cheese has a clean, 
sour-milk or lactic-acid flavor. In texture, it is smooth and free from 
holes. It is served with crackers or in salads and in sandwiches. 

Parmesan is a hard cheese, known in Italy as "Grana" because of 
its granular appearance when broken. The hardness of the cheese 
makes cutting it practically impossible. It has small holes or eyes. 
It is used in cooking, principally. It is grated and added to soup, 
macaroni, spaghetti and similar dishes. 

PiMiENTO Cheese is a cream, Neufchatel or ground Cheddar 
cheese to which pimientos have been added. It is used chiefly for 
sandwiches. 

Pineapple Cheese is an old, very hard Cheddar cheese. It gets 
its name from its shape. It is bright yellow and vanished on 
the surface. It is so hard that it is necessary to grate it. It has a 
stronger flavor than ordinary Cheddar cheese but is used in practically 
the same way. 

Provolona is a very hard Italian cheese resembling Caclocavallo, 
the main difference being in the shape. It is used in the same way. 

Roquefort is a semi-hard cheese made from goat's milk. It is 
ripened by a green mold which gives it a mottled appearance through- 



CHEESE 377 

out. It is found on the market In cylindrical form about seven and 
one-quarter Inches in diameter and three and one-quarter inches thick, 
also In rectangular form and In small wedge-shaped portions. The 
pieces are without a definite rind and are wrapped in tin-foil. They 
must be kept cold. Roquefort has a strong odor and taste and is best 
served with highly flavored foods. It may be served in salads or with 
wafers and coffee. 

RicoTTE Is a very hard Italian cheese. It is similar to Caclocavallo 
and Provolona, except in shape and in being made from albumen whey 
instead of milk, and Is served the same way. 

Stilton Is a semi-hard cheese having a very characteristic wrinkled 
or ridged skin or ring. When cut, It shows blue or green portions of 
mold which give it its characteristic piquant flavor. It belongs to the 
Roquefort group. It is served as Roquefort Is, In salads or as dessert 
with wafers and coffee, or with pie. 

Swiss Cheese Is variously known as Gruyere, Emmenthal, Sweitzer 
and true Switzerland. The peculiar Swiss-cheese flavor is often called 
a hazel-nut taste. It is a trifle sweet and very tempting. The typical 
Switzerland cheese has evenly distributed eyes or holes about the size 
of a cherry, with a dull shine on the Inner lining, but the cheese is now 
packed In small cakes without rind and without holes. The imported 
Switzerland Is yellow In color; the American Swiss is white. Switzer- 
land cheese may be cooked, but is often served in sandwiches or as 
dessert with pie or with wafers and coffee.

with soup or salad. 

BAKED RICE AND CHEESE 

3 cups cooked rice 1 cup milk 

2 cups cheese 2 tablespoons butter 
Yz teaspoon salt Crumbs 

Cayenne 

Put a layer of cooked rice in a greased baking-dish, cover 
with a layer of grated cheese, season with salt and cayenne. 
Continue adding layers until the dish is almost full. Add 
enough milk to come half-way to the top of the rice. Cover 
with crumbs, dot with butter and bake in a moderate oven 
(3 50°-400° F.) fifteen to thirty minutes. 

CHEESE WAFERS 

Spread grated cheese on thin crackers, season witli a bit of 
paprika and heat in a quick oven until the cheese is melted. 
Serve with soup or salad. Thin slices of toasted bread may be 
used instead of the crackers. 

CHEESE STICKS OR STRAWS 

Use any left-over plain or puff paste. Roll out to one-quarter 
inch in thickness, sprinkle one-half of it with grated cheese. 



382 

Fold over the other half and roll out again. Sprinkle with 
cheese and proceed as before; repeat three times. Cut into 
very narrow strips and bake for ten minutes on the top shelf 
of a very hot oven (500° F.). 



CHEESE BISCUITS 

% cup grated cheese Cayenne 

% cup flour 1 egg-yolk 

1/^ cup shortening 

Mix the cheese and flour, then cut the shortening into this 
mixture; add a little cayenne pepper and moisten with the yolk 
of the egg. Roll out to one-fourth inch thick, cut into long, 
narrow strips and bake in a very hot oven (500° F.) five to 
seven minutes. 

If you prefer use the ordinary recipe for baking-powder 
biscuits, making the biscuits in two layers and sprinkling grated 
cheese between the layers.

Selection of Vegetables 

Buy vegetables in their season. Many vegetables are in the 
market the year round, and modern agriculture has greatly 
extended the season for many others but some, when out of 
season, lack flavor and freshness. 

Vegetables should be fresh, firm (not hard), and ripe. Do 
not buy vegetables that are old, withered, moldy or bruised, 
underripe or overripe; there is no saving in cost from purchas- 
ing such vegetables. Head vegetables should be solid, with 
few waste leaves. Cauliflower should be white and firm, with 
no blemishes. Leafy vegetables should not be wilted. Peas and 
beans should have crisp pods. Buy vegetables of medium size 
and regular shape. 

383 



384 

Buy only the amount of summer vegetables you can use 
immediately, because they deteriorate in quality very quickly 
and are best when cooked soon after gathering. 

Winter vegetables may be bought in larger amounts If there 
is a suitable dry, cool place for storage. 

Get acquainted with vegetables that you or your family have 
never eaten. For the first time buy only enough for your own 
lunch and cook them after your favorite method. If that is 
successful, try them on the family. If not, try again with an- 
other recipe, until you find one you think they will like. 



Care of Vegetables 

Summer Vegetables — If these are not to be cooked at once, 
they should be put in the refrigerator or some other cool dry 
place. Peas and corn, especially, should be cooked soon after 
they are gathered, because they lose their sweetness on standing. 
Lettuce should be sprinkled and wrapped in a heavy cloth or 
paper, and put into the refrigerator until it is used. Salad 
greens keep a week or more in mechanically cooled refrigerators 
if they are washed and placed in closely covered enamel or 
porcelain containers after being well drained. Cloths or paper 
wrappings dry out too quickly in mechanically cooled 
refrigerators. 

Cut the stems of wilted vegetables and plunge into cold water 
to freshen. 

Winter Vegetables — ^These should be in good condition, 
firm and uninjured and stored in a dry, cool, well ventilated 
place. Most of them keep better if they are piled up so that 
the air is excluded. Squash, however, keep better if they are 
spread out so that they do not touch one another. Squash and 
sweet potatoes require a warmer place than other vegetables. 
Vegetables cannot be kept successfully in an unpartitioned cellar 
containing a furnace. Vegetables should not be overripe when 
stored, but should be nearly mature. Parsnips improve in 
flavor if they are allowed to freeze before they are stored. They 
should be watched carefully and if they show signs of spoiling, 
should be used at once or removed from the other vegetables.

Preparation of Vegetables for Cooking 



Wash all vegetables before cooking, even though they look 
clean. A vegetable brush is almost a necessity. Soak wilted 
vegetables before peeling them. Vegetables that are soaked 
after they are peeled lose some soluble food materials. Dry 
winter vegetables may be improved by soaking them for several 
hours. Scrape thin-skinned vegetables; pare thick-skinned 
vegetables or remove the skin after cooking. Make thin par- 
ings except in the case of turnips, from which a thick layer of 
corky material should be removed. Discard decayed vegetables. 

Many vegetables, particularly of the bud, head and fruit 
groups, need to be immersed for a period in cold salt water. 
This freshens the fiber and drives out any insects that have 
taken refuge in crevices. Leaf vegetables need to be washed 
in several waters, the first of which should be salted for the 
same reason. The leaves should be lifted out of the water rather 
than the water poured off. This permits any sand to sink to 
the bottom of the pan. A tablespoon of liquid ammonia added 
to the last gallon of wash water will remove the last film that 
carries an earthy flavor. 

What Vegetables Provide 

The appreciation of vegetables as food has greatly increased 
in recent years with an extended understanding of their 
peculiar values. The modern woman realizes that these values, 
having been paid for at the market, must be retained in the 
preparation, if her family is to benefit by her intelligent pur- 
chases. Vegetables are one of the three groups of food that 
protect growth and vitality and preserve the characteristics 
of youth, the others being milk and fruits. The importance of 
these protective foods may be realized by the fact that scientists 
have found an astonishing relation between the early onset of 
old age and the food habits of persons involved. The modern 
woman knows that vegetables provide not only starches and 
sugars for energy, as well as several forms of protein, but what 
is most important they provide impressive amounts of Vitamins 
A, B, C, E, and G, in addition to mineral salts. (See pages 39 



to 44.) These mineral salts are especially Calcium, Phosphorus, 
Iron, Copper, Manganese, and Sulphur, as well as Iodine, in 
vegetables grown along the seashore. Besides all this, she knows 
that the generous use of many vegetables helps to keep up the 
body's normal alkaline balance which contributes so very largely 
to sound health and vitality. 

Cooking to Retain These Values 

Many vegetables can be and are eaten uncooked with all 
their values intact. But many more need to be cooked before 
they can be served. Preparation by cooking should result in 
the least possible loss while it enhances values not otherwise 
available. For this reason cooking should: 

1. Swell and burst the starch cell so that the center is softened and made 
digestible. 

2. Sterilize the vegetable thoroughly. 

3. Break up tough fiber so it is edible and digestible. 

4. Release food proteins and minerals from their fiber cells. 

5. Provide hot food. 

6. Inaease many flavors and some colors. 

Baking is the best method to secure all these results and still 
preserve Vitamins and minerals. Dry baking in their skins, 
generally used for potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, turnips, 
carrots, onions, and parsnips, is a simple method whereby the 
vegetable is packed in a pan or laid on the rack of a hot oven 
to remain until just tender when pierced with a sharp fork. 
Baking, however, also includes the roasting of whole vegetables 
with meat, gravy, or fat, especially when potatoes or sweet 
potatoes are scraped, thus preserving mineral values just under 
the skin. 

Au Gratin and Scalloping are other forms of baking, 
especially when fresh vegetables are used. In the latter method, 
layers of the vegetable are alternated in a baking dish or ring 
mold with white sauce, cream or milk, and seasonings, and in 
the former method a covering of buttered bread crumbs or 
buttered crumbs and cheese is added. Leftover cooked 
vegetables may be prepared by these methods also, but the 
Vitamin and mineral value will be determined by the first cook- 
ing. Only baking in the jacket will insure the preservation of 
the Vitamins. 



VEGETABLES 387 

Broiling is the exposure to direct heat and can be used for 
some vegetables. The minerals will be less injured than the 
Vitamins, for the high heat destroys most of the latter. 

Deep Fat Frying, next to baking, is another satisfactory 
way to retain most of the food values. The vegetable is sliced 
or cut into convenient form, dipped in egg and crumbs or 
batter, and immersed in enough very hot fat to cover well. 
This permits quick cooking with little loss. 

In Sauteing, the shredded or broken vegetable is turned 
into a shallow pan or skillet in which a small amount of fat 
has been heated. Cooking takes longer and more fat is absorbed 
by the food, hence, for many persons the process is not 
advisable. 

Boiling does the most damage to fresh vegetables, yet it is 
used most frequently by the largest number of homemakers. 
Although there are methods that reduce the losses to a minimum, 
the modern woman will remember that boiling is to be used 
least often, and always to be overbalanced by the better methods. 
Most of the mineral salts occurring in vegetables are easily dis- 
solved in water and the loss of Vitamins during boiling takes 
place in several ways. They may be destroyed by overheating, 
by prolonged exposure to the air, and by dissolving out in the 
cooking water. When this is drained off and discarded, the 
principal food values gained by the intelligent buying of 
vegetables has been thrown away. In every case only the small- 
est possible amount of water should be used and it should be 
boiling rapidly when the vegetables are dropped in. They 
should be cooked only until just tender, and by this time 
most of the water has been evaporated. Greens such as spinach, 
chard, and dandelions need only the water that clings to the 
leaves. They go into a cold pot with the heat turned on after 
the vegetable is in the kettle. 

To Boil Vegetables the Proper Way, four methods must 
be taken into account: 

1. The green vegetables are best cooked in water that is slightly alkaline. 
If there is any doubt, add a bit of baking soda the size of a pinhead. 
No drinking water would be acid enough to need more. Use an un- 
covered kettle and cook only until tender to the fork. If overcooked, 
green vegetables turn brownish because of chemical changes in the 
coloring matter, the fine flavor is ruined, while food values are lost. 

2. White fresh vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, and onion are 



388 

Strong flavored, due to their special oils. Hard water changes these oils 
so that the white color turns to yellow or brown. To prevent this, add 
1 teaspoon of lemon juice or white vinegar. Drop the vegetable into 
enough rapidly boiling water to cover and cook with the kettle uncovered 
until just tender to the fork. Add the drained water, if any, to your 
soup stock. 

3. The red color in vegetables is produced by acid and needs to be kept 
that way. Tomatoes usually have enough acid of their own to keep the 
color, but beets and red cabbage need a teaspoon of lemon juice or 
white vinegar. Cook in a small amount of water in a covered kettle. 

4. Yellow vegetables are among the most valuable and stable. That rich 
yellow color is not only beauty but actually the foundation of Vitamin 
A. Not much damage can be done to it although the minerals and other 
Vitamins can still be destroyed if the vegetable is carelessly handled. 

Li general, the destruction of Vitamins is reduced when 
vegetables are boiled at high temperatures for the shortest pos- 
sible time, in the smallest possible amount of water. Then the 
minerals, too, will be saved. 

Steaming as a method of cooking vegetables is valuable for 
those that can stand a high temperature for a long period, or 
those that are cooked in the meat pot so that the extracted 
minerals and Vitamins are used in the gravy. It is particularly 
good for dried and starchy ones. The long, slow process gives 
the starch cell time to swell and gelatinize. It is most valuable 
at high altitudes, because the extra pressure keeps the steam at 
212° F. or more, while in the open-air cooking the high altitude 
reduces the boiling point below 212° F. 

"Waterless Cooking of fresh vegetables is any process in 
which no water is added. The water in the vegetable itself does 
the cooking. A thick-walled kettle with a tight-fitting lid isi 
the necessary equipment. Very low heat is used, and the 
vegetable is tender in a very short time because neither heat nor 
steam escapes. No minerals are lost and the loss of Vitamins is 
almost as low as in baking. 

All cooking of vegetables reduces the Vitamin C content, 
although tomatoes and the baked potato manage to retain 
most of theirs. To insure an adequate daily supply of Vitamin 
C, the modern woman never loses sight of the fact that some 
fresh fruits and vegetables must be served every day. 

ARTICHOKES 

The French artichoke is boiled in salted water, served hot 
with brown butter or Hollandaise sauce, or cold with mayon- 



VEGETABLES . 389 

naise. The spiny choke below the leaves and above the heart 
must be discarded. The Jerusalem artichoke is washed, pared, 
I boiled like a potato and dressed with seasoning, melted butter 
and minced parsley. 

ASPARAGUS 

Trim off hard stalks and scales to the head. Tie in bunches, 
stand upright in boiling salted water. After 10 minutes turn 
^ into loaf pan and continue with heat under the stems. Serve 
\ with browned butter or Hollandaise. 

BOSTON BAKED BEANS 

No. 1. 

1 pint pea beans 1^ teaspoon salt 

1 small onion 14 teaspoon dry mustard 

Yq pound salt pork, part fat 2 tablespoons molasses 

Soak beans in cold water overnight. In the morning drain 
and turn into a bean-pot; or simmer until skins begin to burst, 
but not long enough to be mushy, then turn into the bean-pot. 
Pour boiling water over salt pork. Scrape the rind until white, 
score in half-inch strips, and bury meat in beans, leaving only 
the rind exposed. Mix salt, mustard and molasses in a cup, fill 
with hot water, stir until well mixed, and pour over the pork 
and beans. Add water to cover, and bake in a 250°-350° F, 
oven six to eight hours, adding more water to cover until the 
last hour, when pot cover is removed and pork raised to the 
surface to crisp. 

Use corned beef instead of pork, or omit meat and use more 
salt, with one-third cup of fat. 

No. 2 — Quick Method — ^Use same ingredients as in pre- 
vious recipe. Do not soak the beans overnight. Place them 
over the fire, cover them with cold water, and slowly bring 
the water to a boil, then set the kettle where the beans will 
simmer, but will at no time boil vigorously. When they have 
cooked in this way for fifteen minutes, drain and add fresh 
boiling water. Add salt pork to the kettle and simmer until 
the beans may be pierced with a straw. Turn the beans into 
a colander to drain; put into bean-pot, season and bake as di- 
rected above.

SOY-BEANS 

Of the many varieties of soy-beans grown in this country, 
the yellow variety is the most popular for cooking purposes, 
though the black and green beans are used, and are particularly 
good in soup. Soy-beans require longer cooking than white 
beans, but the length of time required is lessened if the beans 
are soaked for twelve hours before cooking. 

BAKED SOY-BEANS 

2 cups yellow soy-beans 2 tablespoons molasses 

1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon mustard 

1 small onion ^ pound fat salt pork 

Soak the beans for twelve hours, then heat to boiling and 
simmer until tender. Unless the beans are tender before they 
are baked, they will not be good. Prepare as directed for 
"Baked Beans." Eight to ten hours will be required to bake 
them. 

BOILED LIMA BEANS 

1 quart green Lima beans or 1 tablespoon fat 

2 cups dried Lima beans 1 cup milk or cream if 

Salt and pepper desired 

If the green beans are used, put them into just enough boil- 
ing water to cover, and boil slowly until tender. Salt the water 
just before cooking is completed. Add fat and salt and pepper 
to taste. If desired, a cup of milk or cream may be added and 
the beans allowed to simmer in it for a moment. 

If dried beans are used they may be soaked twelve hours 
in plenty of cold water, and boiled in the same water with one- 
eighth teaspoon of soda added for each quart of water; or 
the process may be hastened by soaking them for one hour and 
simmering them for two hours. If they are not soaked at all, 
they can be made tender by simmering for two and one-half 
hours. The water should be drained off before the milk or 
cream is added. 

STRING BEANS 

1 quart string beans Salt and pepper Butter 

Wash beans, string and snap or cut into short pieces. Cover 
with least possible amount of boiling water and cook gently

until tender. Salt the water just before cooking is completed. 
"When done, drain and season with butter, salt and pepper. 

If the flavor of salt pork is liked cut slice of salt pork into 
small pieces and fry until brown, then add one tablespoon flour, 
one cup hot water, and the beans. Simmer for a few minutes 
and serve hot. 

BOILED BEETS 

Wash the beets thoroughly and remove the leaves, being very 
careful not to break off the little fibers and rootlets which re- 
tain the juices and coloring matter. Use plenty of water in 
cooking. If the beets are tough and withered, soak them for 
twenty- four hours in plenty of cold water before beginning to 
cook them. 

Try with a fork, and when they are tender drop them into 
a pan of cold water and slip off the skins with the hands. If 
small, serve whole. I'f large, slice those to be used immediately, 
place in a dish and season with salt, pepper, and butter or savory 
fat. A teaspoon of sugar may be added also if the beets are not 
naturally sweet enough. Set them over boiling water to heat 
thoroughly and serve hot, with or without vinegar. Cold beets 
left over may be covered with vinegar and used as pickles. 

BEET GREENS 

Carefully wash and clean young beets, leaving roots and tops 
together. Put them into a kettle with very little boiling water 
and allow them to cook until just tender. Salt the water just 
before cooking is completed. Drain as dry as possible, in a col- 
ander. Chop, if desired. Serve hot with vinegar or with butter, 
salt and pepper. 

BROCCOLI 

Broccoli is a variety of cauliflower that is green instead 
of white. It was very popular in Colonial gardens and con- 
tinued to be grown and sold along the east coast but gained 
popularity very slowly among native Americans. Within the last 
ten years growers on the west coast have promoted it and it is 
now as popular and often more abundant and lower priced than 
cauliflower. Shipped in ice from early cuttings, even the largest 
stalks are often tender. Choose heads and leaves that are bright 
green and crisp. Cut off only such portions of the stalk as are 



39^ 

too hard and tough to admit the knife. Wash under running 
water and refrigerate, if not to be used at once. When ready 
to cook, use a deep kettle just large enough for the head or heads 
and bring salted water to a rapid boil. Insert carefully, stem 
end down, leave uncovered and when the water stops boiling 
add soda the size of a small pea to the water around the stems. 
The heads should not be submerged. When water boils up 
again they will cook more slowly than the stems and both will 
be tender in 15-25 minutes. If the heads are under water, they 
cook so much more rapidly that they will be mushy before the 
stems are tender. Broccoli heads, stems and leaves are valuable 
sources of vitamins A and G, as well as iron and calcium. 

Serve with brown butter sauce, brown butter and crumbs, 
HoUandaise sauce or au gratin. Broccoli can be used instead 
of spinach for cream soup, especially when the green color 
is wanted. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Pick off the dead leaves from the sprouts, soak the sprouts 
in cold salted water for one-half hour, wash them and put 
them on the fire in plenty of boiling water. Boil in an un- 
covered saucepan until tender. Just before they are done, 
salt the water. Drain in a colander. Reheat; season with salt 
and pepper, and serve with cream sauce or melted butter. 

BOILED CABBAGE 

Cut the cabbage into desired shapes. Place it in a kettle with 
a generous amount of water. Cook uncovered until just tender. 
Add salt to the water just before cooking is completed. Drain, 
add butter or bacon fat, salt and pepper. 

A little milk or cream may be added or it may be creamed or 
scalloped or served au gratin. 

SCALLOPED CABBAGE WITH CHEESE 

i small head cabbage 1 ^ cups medium white sauce 

2 cups grated cheese Vz to Y^ cup bread-crumbs 

Cook the cabbage as directed for boiled cabbage. Into a 
greased baking-dish^ put a layer of cabbage, then a layer of 
cheese, then a layer of white sauce, and continue to add layers 



yEGETABLES 393 

until the ingredients are all used. Cover the top of the mixture 
with the crumbs, which may be mixed with a little melted but- 
ter, and bake in a moderate oven (3 50° -400° F.) for about 
twenty minutes, or until the crumbs are brown. 

CARROTS, TOASTED 

To serve carrots as a separate vegetable, scrape and wash; 
leave young carrots whole and cut old carrots in slices length- 
wise or crosswise. Boil them until tender (15-30 minutes) in 
water containing one teaspoon sugar. Just before cooking is 
completed, salt the water. Drain, add butter, and seasoning or 
roll in butter, then in corn flakes and brown in oven at 3 50° F. 

^, , CARROTS AND PEAS 

No. 1. 

2 cups cubed, cooked carrots 3 tablespoons butter or other 

1 cup cooked peas, fresh or fat or 

canned Medium white sauce 

Combine the carrots and peas, reheat and serve with melted 
butter or any savory fat such as bacon fat; or combine with a 
white sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

No. 2 — ^WiTH Green Mint — Combine the carrots and peas, 
as directed above, add one-half cup mint leaves and a little boil- 
ing water and boil for five minutes. Drain, add salt and pepper, 
a generous amount of butter and a sprinkle of sugar. Set in 
the oven until the sugar melts. Serve with a garnish of fresh 
mint leaves. 

CARROT MOLDS 

2 cups grated raw carrot 1 teaspoon salt 

yz cup bread-crumbs 2 tablespoons melted fat 

2 eggs Yz cup milk 

Wash, scrape and grate the carrots and mix with the crumbs. 
Beat the eggs and add to them the salt, fat and milk. Add this 
mixture to the carrot and crumb mixture. Fill a greased ring 
mold or popover cups, set in a pan of hot water and bake in a 
slow oven (250°-325° F.) until firm. 

BOILED CAULIFLOWER 

Remove the green leaves from the cauliflower and cut off 
any bruised or dirty spots. Place it, top downward, in a deep 



394 

bowl of cold, salted water and allow it to stay there about half 
an hoiir to draw out dust and other impurities. Cook it, whole 
or broken into flowerets, in boiling water, uncovered. Just 
before cooking is completed (15-30 minutes) salt the water. 
Lift out the cauliflower carefully and allow it to drain in a 
warm place. Pour medium white sauce over it or send the 
sauce to the table in a sauce-boat, or serve it with melted butter 
and paprika. 

Sometimes hot boiled cauliflower is sprinkled with grated 
cheese and then with buttered crumbs and baked to a light 
brown in a moderate oven (400° F.), or it may be sprinkled 
with the grated cheese and served without baking. 

SCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER 

1 medium cauliflower 1 Yz cups medium white sauce 

2 hard-cooked eggs or Bread-crumbs 
4 tablespoons grated cheese 

Break the cauliflower into flowerets before boiling. Drain. 
Place a layer of the cooked cauliflower in a greased baking- 
dish, then a layer of eg^ slices or of grated cheese, then a layer 
of white sauce. Repeat until all the cauliflower is used. Put 
a layer of crumbs over the top and bake in a moderate oven 
(3 50° -400° F.) from fifteen to thirty minutes. A bit of 
cayenne pepper or paprika may be added for additional season- 
ing. 

CREAMED CELERY 

2 cups celery cut into inch 2 tablespoons flour 

long pieces 2 tablespoons fat 

Yz cup milk Salt and pepper 

"Wash the stalks clean and cut them into pieces. Place the 
celery in a stew-pan, cover with boiling water and boil until 
tender (about half an hour), by which time the water should 
be reduced to about one-half cup. Make a sauce with the 
celery water, milk, flour and butter. Add the cooked celery 
and season with salt and pepper. 

SCALLOPED CELERY 

Stew celery, as directed in the preceding recipe, using all milk 
in the sauce instead of part celery water. Turn the creamed 



VEGETABLES 395 

celery into a greased ramekin, sprinkle with grated cheese and 
buttered crumbs and bake in a moderate oven (3 50° -400° F.) 
until it is a golden brown (15-30 minutes). 



CELERIAC 

Not every housewife knows celeriac, but it is well worth 
adding to her list of vegetable acquaintances. It is a variety of 
celery grown for its turnip -like root instead of for the blanched 
stalks. The flavor is similar to that of celery. 

To prepare celeriac, trim off the tops, wash and pare the bulb^ 
drop it into boiling water and cook about one-half hour, or 
until tender. Add the salt just before cooking is completed. 
It may then be prepared in the same way as creamed or scalloped 
celery, or may be used, cold, in salads. 

BOILED GREEN CORN 

To have this vegetable in perfection, the husks should be left 
on until just before it is to be boiled. Plunge the husked ears 
into boiling water and cook from seven to twelve minutes, 
according to the size of the corn. Do not salt the cooking water, 
as this toughens the corn. 

Lay a napkin on the serving-plate. Pile the corn upon this 
in a pyramid, cover it with the corners of the napkin and send 
It to the table. 

CORN SOUFFLE 

1 tablespoon fat Pepper 

1 tablespoon flour 1 boiled pimiento 

54 cup milk 2 cups corn pulp 

1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 

y4 teaspoon paprika 

Make a white sauce, using the fat, flour, milk and seasoning. 
Rub the pimiento through a sieve and add it to the sauce. 
Add the corn to the mixture. Cool slightly, then add the well- 
beaten egg-yolks and fold in the stiffly beaten egg-whites. Turn 
into a greased baking-dish, set the dish in a pan of hot water, 
and bake in a moderate oven (375° F.) until the egg is set, 
about thirty minutes.

FRIED EGGPLANT 

1 eggplant Cracker-dust or bread-crumbs 

Salt Egg 

Cut the eggplant into one-half -inch slices, pare and sprinkle 
each slice with salt. Lay slice upon slice and place a plate upon 
the top. Let stand two hours. The salt will draw out the dis- 
agreeably bitter flavor. Half an hour before serving, wipe each 
sHce dry, dip in beaten egg, then in cracker dust or fine bread- 
crumbs, and saute in hot fat. Put a pan in the oven or in some 
other place where it can be kept hot; lay a piece of absorbent 
paper in the pan, and upon it place the slices as they come crisp 
and brown from the frying-pan. Serve on a hot platter with 
the slices overlapping. 



STUFFED EGGPLANT 

1 eggplant Yz cup water 

2 tablespoons butter 2 cups crumbs 
Salt and pepper 

Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise and scoop out the center 
pulp, leaving the rind about one-half inch thick so that the 
shape may be firm. Cover the shells with cold water. Chop 
the pulp fine, season it with salt, pepper, and butter, and cook 
in a frying-pan for ten minutes, stirring well, then add water 
and one cup of bread-crumbs. Drain the shells, sprinkle the 
interior of each with salt and pepper and fill them with the 
mixture. Spread the remaining crumbs over the tops. Place 
the halves in a baking-dish or deep pan, and pour enough hot 
water into the pan to come one-third up the sides of the plant. 
Bake in a moderate oven (350°-375° F.) one-half hour, and 
serve hot. 



CREAMED CHICORY OR ENDIVE

milk and seasonings, adding the egg-yolk last, and pour it over 
the vegetable. 

SAUTEED LENTILS 

1 pint lentils Salt and pepper 
Ys teaspoon soda 2 tablespoons fat 

"Wash the lentils and soak over night. In the morning, drain 
them, cover with warm water in which the soda has been dis- 
solved, and bring them quickly to the boiling-point. Boil 
gently for one hour, drain, cover them again with fresh boil- 
ing water, and boil gently until tender; this generally requires 
from two to three hours longer. Test by mashing a lentil 
between the fingers. If it crushes quickly, they are done. 
Drain in a colander. 

Melt fat in a frying-pan ; add the lentils, with salt and pepper 
to season; stir them over the fire for fifteen minutes. Two 
minced onions may be added, if desired.

BOILED MACARONI OR SPAGHETTI 

Break the macaroni or spaghetti into short lengths. Cover 
Vith plenty of boiling water and boil until soft, twenty-five to 
thirty-five minutes generally being required. If a cooker with 
perforated inner container is not available, stir occasionally 
w^ith a fork to prevent sticking to the kettle. Turn into a sieve 
and drain thoroughly. Place in the serving-dish and cover with 
tomato sauce. Serve grated cheese with it or mix the cheese 
with the tomato sauce. Some people prefer spaghetti cooked 
in long pieces. To do this place the ends in boiling water and

^ pound grated cheese lYz cups milk 
Salt and pepper 

Boil and drain the macaroni or spaghetti as directed in the 
preceding recipe. Arrange a layer in the bottom of a pudding- 
dish. Over it sprinkle some of the cheese and scatter over this 
bits of butter or other fat. Add a sprinkling of salt and pepper. 
Fill the dish in this order, having macaroni on top, well oiled 
with fat but without cheese. Add just enough milk to cover 
well and bake in a moderate oven (3 50°-400° F.), about one- 
half hour. Serve in the dish in which it was baked. 

MUSHROOMS 

To Prepare Mushrooms for cooking by any method, cut 
off the stalks, pare the caps, or brush well if they are fresh and 
tender, and drop them into a bowl of water which contains 
the juice of half a lemon or a tablespoon of vinegar if you wish 
to keep them from darkening. If the stalks are solid and tender, 
they may be peeled, cooked and served with the caps, otherwise 
cook them with the peelings in a small amount of water, for 
mushroom stock. 

Too much cooking toughens mushrooms. Three or four 
minutes will heat canned mushrooms, and five or six minutes 
will cook fresh ones, usually.

MUSHROOMS UNDER GLASS 

2 tablespoons butter 1 slice toast 

Yz tablespoon lemon- juice 6 mushroom caps 

Salt and pepper J4 cup heavy cream 

Yz teaspoon minced parsley 

The quantities given allow for service of only one person. 

Baking dishes with bell-shaped glass covers are obtainable at 
most house-furnishing stores. The mushrooms should be served 
with the covers on. 

Cream butter and add lemon -juice, drop by drop, salt, pepper 
and minced parsley. Cover the bottom of an individual bak- 
ing-dish with a circular piece of toast three-eighths of an inch 
thick, wetting the under side with half the sauce already made. 
Pile mushroom caps, cleaned and peeled, on the toast and pour 
over them the remainder of the sauce and the heavy cream. 
Cover with glass and bake in a quick oven (400° -4 50° F.) 
about twenty-five minutes. Save the stalks, if tender, or stew 
with skins in a little water to make stock for seasoning sauces 
and gravies.

own liquor. Serve on toast, very hot. 

^, , BOILED OKRA 

No. 1. 

1 quart tender okra pods 3 tablespoons butter 
Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon vinegar 

Test the okra by breaking off the tips of the pods. If there 
are tough strings that will not break easily the pod is too old to 
be served as a vegetable and should be kept for a soup or sauce 
which is to be strained. The pods of okra are so sticky that 
special care is needed to avoid breaking them during the clean- 
ing. "Wash them well, and remove the stems, place in sufficient 
boiling water to cover them and boil until tender (20-40 min- 
utes) . Add salt just before cooking is completed. Okra should 
boil very slowly, as rapid boiling will break it in pieces. When 
it is tender, turn into a colander to drain, then lay it in a serv- 
ing dish. Melt the butter, add the vinegar and a little salt and 
pepper; mix well, and pour the sauce over the okra. 

No. 2. 

2 cups okra Salt and pepper 

2 tomatoes 1 tablespoon butter 

Test and wash the okra as above; remove stems and cut the 
pods into slices, crosswise. Place in a granite stew-pan, just 
cover with boiling water and simmer until tender (20-40 min- 
utes). Add the tomatoes, peeled and chopped, and stew for 
ten minutes longer. Add butter, salt and pepper, and serve. 

BOILED ONIONS 

Peel the onions. If they are very large cut them in quarters. 
Cook in boiling water, uncovered, until tender (30-60 min- 



VEGETABLES 403 

utes). Just before cooking is completed, add salt to taste. 
When cooked, drain well, season with butter and pepper and 
serve hot. 

CREAMED ONIONS 

In peeling the onions remove all of the green leaves, for they 
should be as white as milk when served. Drop them into boil- 
ing water and boil uncovered for ten minutes. Drain, add 
freshly boiling water and continue cooking until tender (30- 
60 minutes) . Just before cooking is completed, add salt. Drain 
thoroughly, place in a serving-dish and pour medium white 
sauce over them. If the onions are large they may be quartered 
before they are cooked. 



STUFFED ONIONS 

6 medium to large onions Yz cup milk 

Yz cup chopped ham or Pepper 

chopped green pepper Y2 teaspoon salt 

Yz cup soft bread-crumbs 1 tablespoon fat 
Fine dry bread-crumbs 

Remove a slice from the top of each onion and parboil the 
onions until almost tender. Drain and remove the centers, leav- 
ing six little cups. Chop the onion that was scooped out and 
combine with it the ham and soft crumbs. Add seasoning and 
refill the onion cups. Place them in a baking-dish, cover with 
crumbs, add the milk, and bake in a quick oven (400° -450° 
F.) until tender. 



CREAMED PARSNIPS 

12 medium-sized parsnips 2 tablespoons flour 

1 cup milk 2 tablespoons fat 

Salt and pepper 

Young parsnips are most desirable, but old ones may be used 
if the woody center is removed. 

Wash and scrape the parsnips, and boil them until tender. 
Drain and cut them into small pieces. Make a sauce of the 
fat, flour, milk and seasonings. Add the cooked parsnips and 
serve.

FRIED PARSNIPS 

12 medium-sized parsnips Salt and pepper 

Flour or fine crumbs 

Scrape and boil the parsnips until tender. If old, remove the 
woody centers. Drain, and when cold, cut them in long, thin 
slices about one-third of an inch thick, and season each slice 
with salt and pepper. Dip the slices in flour or fine crumbs and 
saute in fat or oil until both sides are thoroughly browned. 
Drain well and serve very hot. 

BOILED PEAS 

2 quarts peas in the shell 2 tablespoons butter 

Salt and pepper 

Fresh peas should not be shelled until just before they are 
needed for cooking. Look them over carefully after shelling, 
taking out any tendrils that may be mixed with them. Wash 
and cook until tender in a covered pan in just enough boiling 
water to prevent scorching. Add salt just before cooking is 
completed. Young peas will cook in ten to twenty minutes 
but those that are more mature require a longer time. Most 
of the water should have cooked away. If any remains, drain 
carefully. Let the peas stand in the drainer over hot water. 
Melt the butter, add salt and pepper and the drained peas. 
Mix well, reheat, and serve. 



CREAMED PEAS 

2 cups cooked peas 1 cup medium white sauce 

Mix peas with white sauce. Reheat and serve. 

BHUGIA 

2 cups peas 2 tablespoons oil or melted fat 

4 medium potatoes Salt 

Chopped green peppers 

This is a popular dish in India and is usually served with the 
dinner roast. Boil the peas and potatoes separately. When the 
potatoes are thoroughly done, drain and let them cool enough 



VEGETABLES 405 

to be easily handled. Drain the peas. Heat the oil in a frying- 
pan. Slice the potatoes and saute potatoes and peas together 
in the oil. Season with salt and sprinkle with chopped green 
peppers. 

RICE AND PEAS 

1 cup rice 2 onions 2 cups green peas 

Boil the rice and peas separately. Chop the onions fine and 
fry them in oil until tender. Add the cooked rice and peas. 

BOILED POTATOES 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, if you wish, 
and drop into cold water. Cook in boiling water until tender 
when pierced with a fork. Just before cooking is completed, 
add the salt. The water should be kept boiling constantly. 
When done, drain and shake the pan over the fire to dry the 
potatoes. Serve in an uncovered dish or cover with a folded 
napkin. Old potatoes should be soaked in cold water for an 
hour or so before boiling. When they are pared, potatoes lose 
much vitamin and mineral content in boiling. It is better, 
therefore, from the nutritional standpoint, to wash them 
thoroughly, scrubbing with a brush, and boil them with the 
skins on. They may be peeled quickly before they are served, 
or served with the skins on. 



RICED POTATOES 

Force hot, freshly boiled potatoes through a ricer or coarse 
strainer. Sprinkle with salt and pile lightly into the serving- 
dish. Serve at once in an uncovered dish. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes, scrub, remove the eyes 
and any blemishes, place in a baking-pan or on the rack in a 
very hot oven (450°-500° F.) and bake until tender (30-60 
minutes). Be sure to have the oven hot before the potatoes 
are put in. To test the potatoes, do not pierce them with a fork, 
but squeeze them with the hand wrapped in a towel. When 
soft, break the skin to keep them from being soggy, and serve. 



4o6 



POTATOES ON THE HALF-SHELL 

Select medium-sized or large potatoes; scrub and bake. Re- 
move a piece of skin from the side of each potato to make it 
boat-shaped, or cut large potatoes in two lengthwise. Scoop 
out the inside, being careful not to break the shell. Mash very 
thoroughly — ^it is advisable to put them through the ricer — 
add butter, salt and milk, and beat well. Pile the mixture 
lightly back in the shells. Do not smooth down the top. Stand 
the filled shells in a shallow pan, return to the oven (400° F.)j 
and brown lightly on top. Tuck in small wieners before serv- 
ing if desired. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Follow directions for potatoes on the half-shell, adding one- 
half cup peanut butter and two egg-whites to the potato mix- 
ture.

most to the top, break an egg into each opening, season with 
pepper and salt and sprinkle with buttered crumbs that have 
been mixed with grated cheese and bake in a slow oven (250°- 
350° F.) long enough to set the egg and brown lightly (about 
six minutes). 

SCALLOPED POTATOES 

6 medium-sized potatoes Milk 

2 tablespoons flour Salt and pepper 

4 tablespoons butter 

Pare raw potatoes and cut them into thin slices. Place in a 
baking-dish a layer of the potato one inch deep, season with 
salt and pepper, sprinkle a portion of the flour over each layer, 
add a part of the butter in bits. Then add another layer of 
the potato and seasoning, as before, and continue until the re- 
quired amount is used. It is advisable not to have more than 



VEGETABLES 40? 

two or three layers because of difficulty in cooking. Add milk 
until it can be seen between the slices of potato, cover and bake 
(350^-400° F.) until potatoes are tender when pierced with a 
fork (1-1/4 hours). Remove the cover during the last fifteen 
minutes to brown the top. Serve from the baking-dish. 

FRANCONIA POTATOES 

Select medium-sized potatoes, pare and place them in the 
baking-pan with the roast, allowing an hour and a quarter for 
their cooking. Turn them often and baste with the gravy from 
the roast. Serve them arranged about the meat on the platter. 
If you wish to shorten the cooking time, parboil them for fifteen 
minutes before putting them into the roasting-pan, and allow 
forty-five minutes for the roasting. 

DUTCH POTATOES 

6 potatoes 6 slices fat salt pork or bacon 

6 frankfurter sausages Pepper 

Scrub medium-sized potatoes; pare or leave the skins on as 
preferred. With an apple-corer cut a tunnel through the center 
of each, lengthwise. Draw through each cavity one of the 
frankfurters. Place in a dripping-pan and lay a blanket of 
fat salt pork or a thick slice of bacon on each potato. Pepper 
lightly and bake in a very hot oven (450°-500° F.) until the 
potatoes are tender, basting occasionally with the drippings and 
a little hot water.

them for one hour in cold water, then drain and dry on a towel. 
Fry in deep fat (395° F.) a few slices at a time until light 
brown, keeping them in motion with a skimmer. Lay them on 
soft paper to drain. Sprinkle lightly with salt, and serve. 

In cool weather, enough potato chips may be cooked at one 
time to last a week or ten days. They should be kept in a cool 
dry place and should always be reheated in the oven until 
crisp, before serving. 

AMERICAN FRIED OR BROWNED POTATOES 

No. 1 — Cut boiled potatoes into slices one-fourth of an inch 
thick. Heat a very little fat in a frying-pan and saute the

potatoes Salt and pepper 

Cut potatoes into small pieces and mix with the white sauce. 
Cook together gently until the potatoes are thoroughly heated 
through. Season to taste. 

No. 2 — Slice boiled potatoes very thin. Turn them into a 
frying-pan with two tablespoons melted butter and pour in 
milk until it almost covers them. Stew, uncovered, over a low 
heat, without stirring, for twenty or twenty-five minutes. Tip 
the pan a little every five minutes and baste the potatoes with 
the milk. If the potatoes are sliced thin enough, the starch in 
them will thicken the milk and the result will be creamy and 
delicious, with all the milk stewed down so that no liquid re- 
mains. Add salt and pepper to taste. If part cream is used^ 
the dish is even more delicious. 

No. 3 — (New Potatoes) 

1 dozen small potatoes 2 tablespoons fat 

2 tablespoons flour Salt Pepper

or red peppers and cooked rice. Fit halves together and truss 
with string or use skewers in opposite directions. Bake or simmer 
in deep pot or baking dish, covered with heavy seasoned tomato 
sauce, until marrow is transparent but not too well done. Serve 
by slicing through so each service is a complete circle. 



SALADS 



FRUITS, nuts, uncooked and cooked vegetables and some 
cooked meats, fish and fowl, served cold and dressed with 
condiments, oils and acids, are known as salads. 



Utensils Needed for Salad Making 

A chilled earthenware bowl is excellent for mixing salad in- 
gredients. Two forks or a fork and a spoon are better to use 
in folding together the ingredients than a spoon alone, because 
they do not crush the materals so much as a single utensil. 

A sharp-edged knife or vegetable cutter is necessary for slic- 
ing vegetables or fruits. Where fruit pulp is to be removed 
from the thin white membrane enclosing it, a thin narrow 
knife slightly curved at the tip is useful. A pair of shears can 
be used for many of the processes of salad making, such as 
shredding lettuce, clipping oflf wilted or discolored edges, etc. 

Various fancy shapes for molding individual salads may be 
bought, or tea-cups or small bowls may be used as molds. 
Gelatin salads may be put into pans and cut in square or fancy 
shapes after they have hardened. The cube trays of mechanical 
refrigerators are excellent for molding gelatin. 

Materials for Salads 

Vegetables — Leaf vegetables, such as head lettuce, curly 
lettuce, endive, chicory, romaine, water cress, celery and cab- 
bage, make very attractive salads served alone with a dressing 
or in combination with other materials. 

Tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, cabbage and ground carrots are 
excellent uncooked materials for salad, as are also Bermuda or 
Spanish onions in thin wafer-like slices or young spring onions 
marinated in French dressing. 

Many cooked vegetables, such as peas, carrots, beans, beets, 
cauliflower, spinach, asparagus and potatoes, are used in salad 
making, alone or in combination. 

Fruits — ^The fruits most commonly used in the preparation 
of salads are oranges, bananas, apples, cherries, grapefruit, 

424 



SALADS 425 

grapes, peacRes, pears and pineapple. "Watermelon or cantaloupe 
adds a delicious flavor to a fruit salad. 

Dried Fruits — ^Dates, figs and raisins give variety to fruit 
salads. 

Meats — Chicken always makes a delicious salad. Veal and 
pork may be combined with chicken and it is difficult to detect 
their use. They may be used alone in salads, also. 

Crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters, salmon, tuna fish and sardines 
are most commonly used in fish salads. Any firm-fleshed cooked 
fish may be diced and combined with other materials. 

Cheese — Cream cheese or cottage cheese, served in mounds 
on lettuce leaves, makes an attractive salad, with bar-le-duc 
or other jelly or jam as a garnish. It can also be mixed with 
green peppers or pimientoes, rolled in nuts, served with pine- 
apple or molded in a loaf and sliced. 

Eggs — ^The most common egg salad is the "deviled egg," or 
salad egg. Hard-cooked eggs can be cut in slices or quarters 
or fancy shapes and served on a bed of lettuce leaves with a 
dressing or used with other ingredients in a vegetable or fish 
salad. 

Herbs — Such herbs as chervil, mint, parsley, peppergrass, 
sorrel and tarragon may be added to salad to give a pungent 
flavor. 

Fennel (finochio) tops, or root and stem of anise flavor, dande- 
lion, chard, escarole, celery cabbage or cooked zucchini are used 
both as body of the salad and as flavoring. Those who have a 
garden will find dill, nasturtium leaves and seeds, catnip and 
rose geranium leaves usable. 

Important Points in Salad Making 

Washing Ingredients — ^Wash salad greens and examine to 
insure the removal of all aphids. Then soak in cold water for 
half an hour to crisp, and dry on a towel or by shaking in a wire 
basket. 

Chilling Ingredients — ^All ingredients, fruits, vegetables, 
and dressing, should be chilled (see directions on next page for 
keeping materials) before being folded together. The bowl 
used should be chilled; also the plates upon which the salad is 
served. 

Frozen Salads — ^This name may seem misleading because 
pieces of fruit or vegetable in salads should never be actually 
frozen. Combined with whipped cream and mayonnaise, the 



426 

mixture is frozen like mousse, but it should not be frozen long 
enough to harden the fruit or vegetable. Salads made of vege- 
table or fruit pulp may be frozen. The freezing can be done 
by packing in ice and salt or by placing the mixture in the 
drawers of a mechanically cooled refrigerator. 

Keeping Materials — ^Lettuce, most vegetables and many 
fruits may be kept for days by wrapping in a damp cloth or 
paper bag and placing on ice. In a mechanically cooled refrig- 
erator, lettuce and other salad greens keep best if they are 
washed and placed in closely covered enamel or porcelain con- 
tainers with a very little water. 

Cutting Materials — Salad materials should be cut in uni- 
form, well-defined pieces small enough so that they will not 
lose their shape in the folding process. If part of the celery to 
be used is tough, cut it in fine pieces and cut the tender parts 
in larger pieces. In this way the toughness will not be detected. 

"When both the dark and light meat of chicken are used, dice 
the dark in small cubes and the light in larger cubes. This gives 
a more pleasing appearance to the salad. If veal or pork is 
used to extend the chicken, dice it finer than the chicken and 
its presence will not be detected. 

Marinating Salads — A marinade is used to give flavor to 
salad materials and is made by mixing oil, salt, and lemon-juice 
or vinegar (sometimes onion-juice) . The vegetables, fish or 
meat may stand an hour or so in the marinade before using. 
"When several vegetables are to be used, each one should be 
marinated separately. For serving, these vegetables may be 
combined, or placed on lettuce leaves in small individual 
mounds, as preferred. 

Addition of Salad Dressing — ^The dressing should never 
be folded into the salad until time for serving, except in the 
case of a salad like potato salad, when it is preferable for the 
dressing to soak in. 

Arrangement of Salad — ^The lettuce leaf should have the 
stem end cut off so that this ragged part does not hang over the 
edge of the plate. Care should be taken that the garnish is 
carefully placed. 

Place the salad o© the lettuce leaf carefully so that it will 
not fall apart and spread ungracefully over the plate. No part 
of the salad should extend beyond the edge of the plate. 



SALADS 427 

Garnishes for Salads 

Chives, mint, chervil, parsley and similar small greens may be 
minced and sprinkled over a green salad. 

Strips of pimiento and green pepper, or a dash of paprika 
may be used to give life to a colorless salad. 

A chapon is a small piece of bread rubbed with garlic. When 
placed in a salad-bowl it gives a delicious flavor to the salad. 

The outside leaves of a head of lettuce may be used as garnish 
for a salad, reserving the heart for heart-of-lettuce salad. 

MOLDED SALADS 

Among the most decorative ways to serve jellied salad are the 
form mold and the ring mold. The latter lends itself to many 
additional touches since the center may be used for decorative 
vegetables, a pile of cut jelly of contrasting color or the bowl 
of salad dressing. Of exact size to fit, the bowl may be of glass, 
china or silver. Be sure the plate onto which the ring is un- 
molded is large enough for all the decoration planned. See page 
344.

Meat and Fish Salads 
CHICKEN SALAD 

2 cups diced chicken Garnish of celery tops, beets 
1 cup diced celery cut into dice, capers, egg- 
Mayonnaise yolks, etc. 
Lettuce 

Left-over chicken makes a very good salad. To prepare a 
chicken especially for salad, rub well with salt and pepper, place 
one small onion and one bay-leaf inside, wrap with a napkin, 
tie securely and steam for three hours, or until a fork can be 
easily turned around in the meat. When the chicken is cold, 
cut the meat into pieces of convenient size for eating. The 
most carefully made salads contain only white meat, but the 
dark meat has a juiciness and flavor not possessed by the breast. 
If dark meat is used, cut it into smaller cubes than the white 
meat and the white will predominate in appearance. Marinate 
the cut up chicken and let it stand. Make a mayonnaise dress- 
ing, stir part of it into the celery, place the celery on a thin 
layer of lettuce or arrange it directly upon the salad-dish and 
garnish the edge with the tips of the celery. Heap the chicken 
mixture in the center, pour over it the remainder of the mayon- 
naise, and garnish with white celery tops, boiled beets cut in 
dice, capers, cold hard-cooked egg-yolks that have been pressed 
through a colander, or any other garnish that pleases the fancy. 

CRAB SALAD 

1 cup crab-meat, fresh or Garnish of crab claws, hard- 
canned cooked eggs, parsley, celery 
French dressing tops, etc. 
Mayonnaise 

If fresh crabs are used, prepare as directed. (See Index.) 
Cut up an amount of celery equal to crab-meat. Marinate 
with French dressing. Place the mixture in the salad-bowl, 
pour over the top a mayonnaise dressing and garnish with crab 
claws and hard -cooked eggs in alternation with bits of green, 
such as parsley, and the leaves of the celery. 

Canned crabs make very good salad. If there is any oil in 
the can, drain it off; sprinkle the crabs well with salt and vine- 
gar, and drain again before adding the dressing. 



SALADS 443 



FISH SALAD 

1 pound flaked, cooked fish 1 cup chopped celery 

2 tablespoons oil Lettuce 

1 tablespoon vinegar Mayonnaise 

The remains of almost any cold fish may be used in salad 
very satisfactorily, but the salad is more successful when made 
of fish that will flake nicely, such as salmon, cod, haddock, or 
halibut. Remove the bones, pick the fish into flakes, turn over 
it oil mixed with vinegar and set away in a cold place. When 
about to serve, chop celery and add to the fish. Arrange crisp 
white leaves of lettuce in cup shapes on a platter, using one or 
two leaves for each, then lay one spoonful of the mixture in 
each cup and pour over it one spoonful of mayonnaise. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

1 Vz cups diced lobster meat Mayonnaise 

Yz cup diced celery Lettuce 

Vinegar 

Prepare lobster as directed (see Index). Remove the meat 
and the coral. Cut the meat into pieces of convenient size for 
eating. Sprinkle a very little vinegar over the lobster, but keep 
the celery crisp until it is time to make the salad. Then mix 
the lobster meat and celery together, stir in enough mayonnaise 
to moisten and flavor the whole. Arrange the salad on the 
center of a bed of crisp white lettuce bordered with green let- 
tuce leaves laid under the outer edges. Pour on the remainder 
of the mayonnaise and sprinkle over it the coral, well pounded, 
and, if liked, a few capers. Garnish with the claws. Some- 
times lettuce leaves are arranged on a platter in cup-like clusters 
of two or three each, and the salad is divided equally among 
the clusters. The salad may be served in the cleaned lobster 
shells. 

OYSTER SALAD 

1 quart oysters 2 tablespoons vinegar 

1 tablespoon oil 1 tablespoon lemon-juice

SALAD DRESSINGS 



THERE are three kinds of salad dressings which are the 
foundation for practically all others used: French dress- 
ing, mayonnaise dressing and boiled dressing. 



French Dressing 

French dressing, made from oil and acid, is the most widely 
used dressing. Vinegar is the acid generally used with the oil 
in vegetable and meat salads, while in fruit salads the juice of 
lemons, grapefruit or oranges is used. 

The choice of oils to be used in dressing is an individual 
matter. Olive oil has the most distinct flavor. With cotton- 
seed or corn oil the amount of condiments used may be slightly 
increased if desired. 

Serve French dressing with chicken, fish, meat, vegetable and 
fruit salads. 



FRENCH DRESSING 



1 clove garlic (optional) 1 tablespoon salt 

1 cup vinegar 1 teaspoon paprika 

2 teaspoons dry mustard ^ teaspoon pepper 
1 tablespoon sugar 2 cups salad oil 

If using garlic, soak it in vinegar Yz hour before mixing 
the dressing. Mix dry ingredients together and place in a covered 
jar or bottle. Remove garlic from vinegar and add vinegar to 
dry ingredients. Pour on the oil slowly. Place in refrigerator 
until ready for use. Just before serving, shake vigorously for 
2 minutes. Makes 3 cups dressing. 

Variations — Tarragon Dressing: Tarragon vinegar may 
be used. Mustard, sugar and paprika may be omitted. 

For Fruit Salads: Use Y^. cup each of lemon or lime and 
orange juice in place of half the vinegar. Reduce mustard to Y2 
teaspoon, salt to 1 teaspoon and paprika to Y2 teaspoon. Increase 
sugar to % cup. Add Y2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce and 
omit pepper and garlic.

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 



No. 1. 



2 uncooked egg yolks I/3 teaspoon mustard 

I/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons vinegar or 
Yi teaspoon pepper lemon juice 

y^ teaspoon paprika 2 cups salad oil 

To yolks, add dry seasonings, beat thoroughly, add vinegar 
or lemon juice and beat again. Add oil gradually (drop by drop 
at first) beating hard between additions. The mixture should 
be thick and creamy. Should mayonnaise curdle, begin with a 
third egg jolk, add a small quantity of oil to the egg, and then 
by very small quantities, add the curdled dressing. At times a 
dressing may be quite firm when left, only to be found curdled 
and disappointing when the time comes to use it. This third 
egg process will, however, usually restore it. Equal proportions 
of vinegar and lemon juice may be used. Tarragon vinegar is 
sometimes used to give an interesting flavor. 

No. 2. 

r egg yolk, hard cooked y^ teaspoon Worcestershire 

1 egg yolk, uncooked sauce 

y2 teaspoon sugar 1 cup salad oil 

y2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons vinegar 

y^ teaspoon pepper or lemon juice 

1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard 

Place hard-cooked egg yolk in a bowl and mash it fine. When 
the yolk is like powder, add uncooked yolk and stir until mix- 
ture is smooth, then add sugar, salt, pepper, mustard and sauce. 
When the whole is well mixed, add oil gradually, stirring con- 
stantly, and thin as necessary with vinegar or lemon juice. Chill 
for 1 hour before using. 

Originally, only a spoon was used in beating this dressing, 
however, now a wire whisk, small wooden spoon, rotary egg 
beater or a four-tined fork may be used. 

Colored Mayonnaise: To color mayonnaise red, add lobster 
paste, raspberry or cooked beet pulp or juice from raspberries 
or beets; for green color add chopped fresh spinach, parsley or 
concentrated liquor from boiled artichokes. 

Dieter's Mayonnaise: Use mineral oil for salad oil.

until needed. 

DRESSING FOR MEAT SALADS 

Tartar, Hollandaise and Vinaigrette sauces (see Index for 
recipes) may be used with meat salads if desired. 



CAKES 



CAKES are of two general types depending upon the basic 
ingredients they contain. In one group are the cakes 
made with fat — the various butter cakes, pound cakes, and 
fruit cakes; and in the other group are those that are made 
without fat — ^sponge and angel cakes. Either kind of cake 
may be baked in many different forms — oblong or round 
loaves, sheets, layers, or individual cakes of various shapes, de- 
pending somewhat upon the kind of cake but also upon the 
way they are to be served. The butter cakes are most fre- 
quently baked in layers, pound cakes in round or oblong loaves, 
and sponge and angel cakes, in sheets or in the tube pans which 
give round loaves with a hole in the center. 

Materials Used in Cake Making 

Sugar — ^Fine grained granulated sugar is the standard sugar 
for cake. A coarse grained sugar may produce a coarse grained 
cake with a hard crust. Light brown or dark brown sugar is 
preferred by most people for fruit cake or any dark cake. 
Brown sugar is lighter and more moist than granulated and 
when it as used instead of granulated sugar the substitution 
should be weight for weight, not measure for measure. 

Shortening — ^Any fat that has a mild flavor may be used 
for the shortening in cake. Butter is the first choice with many 
cooks because of its flavor, but it is the most expensive of fats. 
Tasteless vegetable or animal oils or hardened fats produce per- 
fect results, aside from the flavor. Since these fats are unsalted 
the amount of salt should be increased by one-half. 

Hard fats should be creamed with the sugar. If they are 
melted and added while hot, the cake is likely to be tough. 
If melted fat is called for, it should be cooled before it is added. 

Eggs — ^Eggs for cake need not be newly laid, but they should 
be of good quality, free from taint and fresh enough to beat 
up well. Two yolks or two whites may be used instead of one 
whole eggy or a yolk may be substituted for a white or the other 
way around. The substitution of yolks for whites or vice versa 
makes a difference in the color and to some extent in the tex- 

451 



J5i 

ture of the cake. In recipes calling for egg whites alone or for 
more whites than yolks, the number of whites cannot be reduced 
without changing the texture of the cake. If an egg white is 
used instead of a yolk, one teaspoon of shortening should be 
added. When fewer whole eggs are to be used than a recipe 
calls for, add one-half teaspoon of baking powder instead of 
each egg omitted, after the first one. Eggs improve the quality 
of the texture of batters, and while a fairly good plain cake can 
be made with only one egg, additional eggs give a lighter, more 
delicate texture, improve the flavor and produce a smoother 
crust. 

Flour — In the cake recipes given in this book, cake flour has 
been used. Cake flour has a low gluten content and therefore 
makes a finer textured cake. Although cake flour is preferred 
for cakemaking, successful cakes are made with all-purpose 
flour. If all-purpose flour is used for cake flour, reduce the 
amount of flour used by 2 tablespoons per cup of flour called 
for and do not beat the batter as long as when using cake flour. 
Always sift flour before measuring. Fill cup lightly. Resifting 
with dry ingredients as directed. 

Leavening Agents — The most usual leavening agents in 
cakemaking are eggs and baking powder. When 1 egg is 
omitted from a recipe the baking powder should be increased 
by Yz teaspoon. If the liquid used is sour milk or cream, use Yz 
teaspoon baking soda for each cup of liquid. Then decrease 
baking powder slightly. It is best to sift the baking soda with 
the dry ingredients. If the soda is dissolved in the sour milk 
it must be added to the mixture immediately or some of the 
gas to be used in leavening will be lost. 

No chemical leavening agent is used in true spongecakes. 
The air incorporated by means of the beaten egg whites, and 
the steam generated in cooking make the cake rise as it is baked. 

Flavorings — A cake shortened entirely with good butter 
needs no additional flavoring though most people add some 
flavoring extract. Vanilla and lemon extracts are used more 
commonly than others, but almond, orange, pineapple, and rose 
give a variety in flavors. Very often the juices of fresh fruit 
such as lemon or orange, or the grated peel or rind, are used 
in certain types of cake. Too much flavoring is a common 
mistake. The amount given in recipes is for an extract of 
average strength. Where an extract of greater strength is used 
the amount should be decreased. 



CAKES 453 



Standard Method of Mixing Butter Cakes 

There are several methods of combining ingredients for but- 
ter cakes, but the method described below is considered the 
standard. 

Cream the Butter or Other Shortening by continued 
rubbing against the sides of the bowl until it is soft and light. 
Some people prefer to use a wooden spoon for this, but a fork 
does the work more quickly. If the shortening is too hard to 
cream easily, warm the bowl slightly by setting it in warm 
water, but do not melt the fat. 

Add the Sugar Gradually and work well after each addi- 
tion. 

Separate the Whites From the Yolks of the eggs. Beat 
the yolks until they are thick and lemon-colored, then add them 
to the creamed shortening and sugar. If the egg is not separated, 
beat the whole egg well and add here. 

Sift the Flour, measure it and add to it all other dry 
ingredients, such as baking-powder, salt and spices,^ and then 
sift again. 

Add the Dry Ingredients and Milk to the first mixture, 
alternately, keeping the batter of the same consistency through- 
out the mixing process. Beat just enough to make the mixture 
smooth. 

Add the Flavoring, then fold in the stiffly beaten egg- 
whites, unless the whites were added with the yolks. 

When Fruits or Nuts Are Used, save out a little of the 
flour to sift over them, and add them to the cake mixture just 
before the egg-whites are added. 

Melt Chocolate Over Hot Water and add just after 
the egg-yolks. Add cocoa as one of the dry ingredients. 



Baking Butter Cakes 

For any cake made with fat, grease the pans with a melted, 
unsalted fat, using a pastry brush or a piece of soft paper, then 
dredge the pans with flour, and shake them to distribute the 
flour over the surface. Invert the pans and shake them to re- 
move all surplus flour, leaving only the thin film which adheres 
to the fat. This helps to give the cake a smooth under crust. 

If the oven temperature is difficult to control, if the cake 



454 

pan is not smooth, or if the cake contains only a small amount 
of fat, it is advisable to line the pans with smooth paper. Cut 
the paper to fit the bottom of the pan, plus an allowance to 
cover the sides. For a rectangular pan, cut out the corners of 
the paper so that it will fit against the sides of the pan without 
overlapping or wrinkling. For a round or oval pan, cut gashes 
along the edge of the paper as far as the part which is to cover 
the bottom. The paper will then overlap smoothly on the 
sides of the pan. Grease the paper after it is fitted into the 
pan. The grease will hold the paper against the sides as the 
cake batter is poured in. 

If you want the cake to rise to the top of the pan, fill the 
pan about two-thirds full. Spread the batter well into the 
corners and against the sides of the pan, leaving a slight de- 
pression in the center. As cake tends to rise more in the 
center than at the edges, this will help to make it flat on top 
when it is done. 

Baking Temperatures — Place the pan in the center of the 
lower grate so that the greatest amount of heat will reach it 
from underneath. A moderate temperature, varying from 
350° to 375°, is best for baking a butter cake. If the oven 
is too hot, a thick brown crust will form on the outside before 
the cake has fully risen and before the inside has thoroughly 
baked, resulting in a cracked surface. 

The Time for Baking depends on the thickness of the cake. 
Cup cakes take from twenty to thirty minutes, layer cakes 
about twenty minutes,, and loaf cakes from forty-five to sixty 
minutes. 

Divide the time of baking into quarters: (1) During the 
first quarter, the cake should rise and little bubbles form on the 
top; (2) in the second quarter, it should continue to rise and 
to form the crust; (3) in the third quarter, it should begin to 
brown, and (4) at the end of the fourth quarter it should be 
browned sufficiently and shrink from the tin. 

Testing the Cake — When the cake is fully baked, it will 
shrink from the sides of the pan. When touched lightly with 
the finger it will spring back. If the finger leaves a depression, 
the cake is not done. 

Another test is to insert a clean wooden toothpick into the 
middle of the cake. If no particles of batter adhere to it when 
it is drawn out, the cake is done. 



CAKES 455 

Care After Baking — After removing the cake from the 
oven, allow it to remain in the pan about two minutes. Then, 
with a spatula or knife, loosen the edges. If there is any 
tendency for the cake to stick on the bottom, wring a cloth 
out of water and place it on the bottom of the pan for a few 
seconds. Turn the cake out on a wire cake-cooler and allow it 
to stand until cool. 



Standard Method of Mixing Cakes Without Fat 

Cakes without fat depend for leavening largely upon the air 
beaten into the eggs. The whites and yolks of the eggs may or 
may not be separated, depending upon the kind of cake. If 
using the whole egg, beat it till thick and lemon-colored; if us- 
ing only the yolk, beat till thick and light in color, add the 
sugar gradually and beat after each addition until the sugar 
dissolves. 

Add the flavoring and liquid, if there is any, and fold in the 
sifted dry ingredients. 

When the whites have been beaten separately, they are added 
last, using the folding motion. Do not beat the mixture after 
the whites have been added. Place at once in a moderate oven 
(325°— 350° F.). 



General Directions for Baking Cakes Without Fat 

Use an ungreased pan for sponge or angel cakes. If they are 
greased the batter cannot cling to the sides of the pan as it bakes 
and thus the cake does not reach its full height. Greasing also 
causes the cake to fall out of the pan during cooling, making 
it flat and soggy. 

Baking Temperatures — True sponge and angel food cakes 
in which eggs are the only leavening are baked in a moderate 
oven (325° — 350° F.) to insure the best volume and texture. 
If baked too slow the results will be a coarse uneven cake; if 
oven is too hot the cake will be small in volume, fine grained 
and tough. It can be truly said of such a cake, "half the making 
is the baking." When baking-powder is used, a slightly higher 
temperature is desirable. The division of baking time is the 
same as for butter cakes. 

When the cake is a light brown, and springs back when 



456 

pressed with the finger, it is done. Remove it to a wire cake 
cooler, invert the tin and allow it to stand till the cake is cool. 
Then remove the cake from the tin. When serving, break it 
apart with two forks; cutting with a knife tends to crush the 
cake and make it appear heavy. 

Causes of Failure in Making Cake 

Cracks and Uneven Surfaces are caused by too much flour 
or too hot an oven. 

A Dry Cake (that is, a fresh cake that seems dry or bready 
inside) may be caused by too much flour, too little fat or by 
the kind of sugar used, i.e., powdered sugar is thought by some 
people to give a dryer cake than granulated sugar. 

A Heavy Sticky Cake means too much sugar or too little 
baking. 

A Moist Sticky Crust is caused by an excess of sugar. 

A Macaroon Crust is caused by too much sugar or too slow 
baking. 

Coarse Grained Cakes are caused by insufficient mixing, 
too slow baking, too much baking-powder, or too much fat. 

Falling is caused by insufficient flour, too much fat, under- 
baking, or opening or jarring the oven early in the baking 
period. 

An Uneven Color is caused by too fast baking or insuf- 
ficient mixing.

WEDDING CAKE 



2 pounds butter 


11/^ teaspoons salt 


1 pound granulated sugar 


1 teaspoon cloves 


% pound brown sugar 


2 teaspoons cinnamon 


20 eggs 


2 tablespoons nutmeg 


2 oranges, juice and grated 


2 tablespoons mace 


rind 


1 glass tart jelly 


1 lemon, juice and grated rind 


3 pounds seeded raisins 


1 teaspoon soda 


2 pounds seedless raisins 


1 cup molasses 


5 pounds currants 


1 cup black coffee 


1 pound almonds 


1 cup fruit juice 


2 pounds citron 


2 pounds flour 


2 cups flour (for the fruit) 



Cream the butter till very soft, add the white sugar and the 
sifted brown sugar and mix thoroughly. Add the beaten yolks 
and mix again with the grated rind. Add one half the soda 
to the molasses, stir until foamy and add, with the coffee and 
fruit juices, alternating with the two pounds of flour, the rest 
of soda, the salt and spices sifted together. Break the jelly into 
pieces and stir in. It is not necessary to have the jelly 
thoroughly mixed in. 

Look over the raisins and currants, wash if necessary, drain 
and dry. Blanch the almonds and slice. Save half the nuts to 
sprinkle on the bottom and top of cake. Cut the citron in thin 
strips. Mix the two cups of flour thoroughly with this fruit. 
Candied orange or grapefruit peel may be used for citron. 

Mix the prepared fruit with the batter. This may be added 
from time to time with the flour. When all is thoroughly com- 
bined fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. 

This amount makes about twenty four pounds of cake, and 
can be baked in small loaves or in one large one. Whatever 
size is chosen line the greased pans with three layers of paper 
(bottom and sides) having the top layer well greased. Sprinkle 
the bottom with about one third of the reserved nuts. Put the 
mixture into the pan making sure that the corners are well filled 
and that the top is level and smooth. Sprinkle the remaining 
nuts on the top. If made into one large cake steam four hours 
and then bake one hour in a very slow oven (250° -2 75° F.). If 
made into small cakes they can be baked without steaming first. 
Bake in a slow oven (250° F.) for two hours. Let cool in the 
pan, but have it stand on a rack so as to have a circulation of 
air underneath as well as on the top and sides. 



CAKES 467 

Turn out and remove the paper. Cool and store in a cool dry 
place tightly covered. A few sound apples placed in the con- 
tainer where cake is stored will help keep the cake moist if it 
must be kept long, but they must be watched and replaced if 
they begin to show decay, or if they become^ shrivelled. 

As there is so much preparation involved, the fruits and nuts 
can be gotten ready several days before the cake is to be baked. 
Even after the cake is entirely mixed and in the pan or pans 
it can stand overnight if kept in a cool place.

CAKE HLLINGS AND 
FROSTINGS 



A TABLE giving the temperatures of boiling sugar sirup at 
its various stages will be found on page 12. 

Fillings — A filling is defined as "something that serves to 
fill up a space or cavity." In connection with cakes, the 
word is used to designate a soft, sweetened, cooked or uncooked 
mixture that will spread easily. It is usually put between layers 
to hold them together, or is put into a cavity in a cake; but 
occasionally it is spread over the top and sides of a cake. Some- 
times a frosting is used between the layers instead of a filling. 

Frosting and Icing — ^A frosting is a preparation of sugar 
and a liquid, which may or may not be combined with eggy 
and may be cooked or uncooked. The term is derived from the 
fact that the first sugar decorations of this sort were uncolored 
and gave the effect of hoar-frost. The word is now used to 
mean any sweet covering applied to cakes, whether white or 
colored. 

Icing has been used interchangeably with the word "frost- 
ing" but more often in reference to the uncooked frostings. 
In the beginning the word was probably used because the sub- 
stance looked like ice, being translucently white instead of 
frostily white. Therefore, it may be desirable to use the word 
"icing" to mean a thin mixture of confectioners' sugar and a 
liquid, spread on to give a glazed surface; and to keep the term 
"frosting" for a thicker, more opaque coating. 

Applying Fillings and Frostings 

Cakes should be cooled and the surface should be free from 
loose crumbs before a filling or frosting is applied, and the filling 
or frosting should be cool enough so that it will not soak in. 
Either the top or the bottom crust may be frosted, but the bot- 
tom crust is likely to be softer and more level than the top 
crust. This point should be considered also when fillings are to 
be put between layers. Fillings usually hold layers together 
better when the bottom crusts are placed together. A very 

472 



CAKE FILLINGS AND FROSTINGS 473 

soft filling should not be used for a cake that is to be kept any 
considerable time before it is eaten because the filling will soak 
into the cake and make it soggy. Sometimes the shape of a loaf 
cake makes it desirable to put the frosting on the bottom crust. 
The frosting may extend over the top of a cake only or may 
be spread over the sides. A well-made boiled frosting should 
be soft, but not soft enough to run. A frosting may be put on 
with a very smooth surface, may be left rough, or may be 
scored in ridges or designs.

COOKIES, DOUGHNUTS, 
GINGERBREAD AND 
. SMALL CAKES 

Cookies 

COOKIE doughs range from very soft to very stiff. What- 
ever the degree of stiffness, a cookie dough is always easier 
to handle if it is allowed to stand for a time (ten to thirty 
minutes) in a cold place before it is rolled. This allows the 
moisture to be thoroughly absorbed and hardens the fat, and 
both of these conditions tend to prevent the dough from being 
sticky even though it is soft. 

Materials Used in Cookies — Butter or any other shorten- 
ing preferred may be used in cookies. See Index for materials 
used in cake making. 

Soft Doughs may be dropped from a spoon on to a baking- 
sheet or may be rolled and shaped with a cutter, a knife or a 
pastry wheel. They are more difficult to roll out than stiff 
doughs, and some practise is necessary to obtain perfect results 
in manipulating them in this way. 

Stiff Doughs are usually rolled out and shaped by cutting. 
Sometimes they are made into small balls and flattened by 
pressure from the hand, a broad knife or a rolling-pin. 

Rolling and Cutting Cookies 

In Rolling Any Dough, take out on the lightly floured 
board only as much as can be handled easily. Flour the rolling- 
pin and use only as much pressure as is necessary to spread the 
dough out into a sheet of the desired thickness. If the dough 
is too soft to be rolled, more flour may be worked in, but the 
texture of the finished cookie will be harder in proportion to 
the amount of flour added. 

Dip the Cutter, knife or wheel in flour, and cut the shapes 
as close together as possible. Lift the cookies on a broad knife 
or spatula and lay them on a greased baking-sheet, allowing a 
little space between for possible spreading. 

483 



484 

Save all the Trimmings for the last rolling. The last 
cookies will not be of the same texture as the first because of 
the extra flour which will be worked into the dough in the 
process of mixing the trimmings into a mass to be rolled again.

Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Add sugar^ 
egg-yolks and water. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg-whites and 
the raspberries leaving the fruit as nearly whole as possible. 
The amount of water may vary somewhat. The batter should 
be thin enough to fold in the fruit, but thick enough to hold 
together well; otherwise, the fruit in cooking will soften it 
too much. 

Drop the fritter mixture from a tablespoon into deep fat 
(3 60° -370° F.) and fry until brown, turning once. Serve 
with powdered sugar or foamy sauce.

CANDIES 



"VVTHEN sugar and a liquid are boiled together, a sirup is 
VV formed which grows thicker as the boiling continues. 
The thickness of the sirup determines the general type of candy- 
that will result. 

Testing the Sirup 

The simplest and most accurate method of determining 
whether the sirup is thick enough for your purpose is to measure 
its temperature, because the temperature rises steadily as the 
sirup thickens. 

A Candy Thermometer registering up to 3 50° F. is not 
expensive, and it will not only give you a higher average of 
success in candy making but will save you the time and labor 
that must otherwise be given to testing the sirup. A table 
giving the various stages of sugar cookery will be found on 
page 12. 

If You Are Not Provided With a Thermometer, the 
following test will help you to determine when to take your 
candy from the fire. 

Drop a little sirup into ice-cold water and pinch it between 
the thumb and finger: 

Soft ball stage (for fondant and fudge) the sirup forms a 
soft ball which loses its shape immediately when removed from 
the water. 

Stif ball stage (for caramels and nougat) the sirup forms a 
stiflf ball which retains its shape for a second or two when 
removed from the water and then flattens out. 

Hard ball stage (for molasses taffy and soft candies to be 
pulled) the sirup forms a hard ball which will roll about on a 
cold buttered plate when removed from the water. 

Light to medium crack stage (for toffee and butterscotch and 
hard candies to be pulled) the sirup forms spirals or threads 
which are brittle under water but which soften when removed 
from the water and stick to the teeth when chewed. 

Hard crack stage (for clear brittle candies) the sirup forms 
spirals or threads which are brittle when removed from the 
water and do not stick to the teeth when chewed. 

502 



CANDIES 503 

Creamy Candies — Creaminess is desirable in soft candies. 
**Creamy" means that the texture should be very smooth, not 
grainy at all; soft but not sticky. This means that the sugar 
must not remain as a sirup, but must crystallize. The crystals, 
however, must be very fine, so that they can not be felt by 
the fingers or in the mouth. 

Creamy candy should not be overcooked. If it reaches too 
high a temperature, accidentally, a little water may be added 
and it may be recooked to the correct temperature. This does 
not give as good a result as one cooking to the correct tempera- 
ture, but it improves a poor product. 

Creamy candy should be cooled before it is beaten. Beating 
candy while it is hot causes large crystals to form and grainy 
candy results. If crystals that form on the side of the pan in 
which candy is cooked fall back into the candy, they tend to 
cause large crystals to form and to make grainy candy. 

A small amount of corn sirup tends to prevent grainy candy. 
Creamy candies made with corn sirup will require longer beat- 
ing before crystallization takes place than will candies made 
from all granulated sugar. They also soften more quickly on 
standing. If too much sirup is. used, the candy will not crystal- 
lize at all and the best thing to do with it is to boil it until it 
reaches the proper stage for a pulled or brittle candy. 

One-eighth teaspoon of cream of tartar or one-half teaspoon 
of lemon- juice or acetic acid to two cups of sugar may be used 
instead of corn sirup or glucose. They change part of the gran- 
ulated sugar to glucose during the cooking process. 

Ingredients Used in Candies 

Sugars — Granulated, confectioners', brown and maple sugar, 
corn sirup, molasses, honey and maple and cane sirups are all 
used in candy, according to the flavor and texture desired. The 
light-brown sugar should be chosen rather than the darker 
brown, for a candy of delicate flavor. The same thing is true if 
corn sirup or molasses is used; the lighter color gives the less 
strong flavor. 

Brown sugar and molasses contain an acid, which if used in 
candies with milk causes the milk to curdle. Therefore, candy 
containing these two ingredients should be stirred while it is 
cooking. Crystallization does not readily occur here because 
the milk tends to prevent it. 



504 

Other Ingredients — ^Nuts of all sorts, chocolate or cocoa, 
butter, milk, cream, egg-whites and fruits such as dates, figs, 
raisins and candied cherries, give special flavor or texture. 

Butter is often used because of its flavor and because it tends 
to make a creamy product. Other mild-flavored fats may- 
be used instead of butter, particularly in candies containing 
chocolate, brown sugar or molasses. 

Chocolate contributes flavor and tends to make a smooth 
candy because of the fat it contains. Three tablespoons of cocoa 
and two-thirds of a tablespoon of butter may be used instead 
of one square of chocolate. 

Fresh milk, dried milk or canned milk, sweetened or un- 
sweetened, may be used in candies. 

CHOCOLATE FUDGE 

2 cups sugar 34 cup milk 

1 or 2 squares chocolate 1 teaspoon vanilla 
Ys teaspoon cream of tartar 2 tablespoons butter 

or 2 tablespoons corn sirup 

Mix the sugar, milk, grated chocolate, cream of tartar or corn 
sirup and boil rather slowly, stirring until the ingredients are 
well blended. Boil to the soft-ball stage (238° F.). Remove 
from the stove, add the butter, but do not stir it in. "When 
lukewarm, add the vanilla and beat until it creams; that is, 
until the shiny appearance disappears and the fudge will hold 
its shape when dropped from the spoon. Spread it in a buttered 
pan and when it hardens mark it into squares. 

MARSHMALLOW FUDGE 

To the recipe for chocolate fudge add three tablespoons of 
marshmallow cream just after taking it from the fire. Beat 
well and pour into buttered pans. 

MAPLE FUDGE 

2 54 cups maple sugar Yz cup boiling water 

1 cup cream or milk 1 cup broken nut-meats 

Break the maple sugar into small pieces and heat it in a 
saucepan with the water. When it is dissolved, add the milk. 
Boil to the soft-ball stage (238° F.). Remove from the fire 



CANDIES 505 

and cool. Wlien it is lukewarm, beat until it creams and add 
the nut-meats. Spread it in a buttered pan and when it hardens 
mark it into squares. 

DIVINITY FUDGE 

2 cups sugar 2 egg-whites 

Yz cup corn sirup % cup blanched almonds 

Yz cup water 1 tablespoon almond or 
y^ cup candied cherries lemon extract 

Put the sugar, water and corn sirup into a saucepan. Stir 
it while it dissolves over the fire, then let it boil without stirring 
to the light crack stage (265 ° F.) . While it is cooking, beat the 
whites of eggs stiffly and when the sirup is ready pour it over 
them, beating constantly. Beat until creamy, add nuts, cherries 
and extract, and pour into buttered tins. 

MAPLE DIVINITY FUDGE 

Follow preceding recipe, using in addition one-half cup 
maple sirup. 

OTHER VARIATIONS OF FUDGE 

Brown sugar may be used partly or entirely in place of white 
or maple sugar. If brown sugar is used, the cream of tartar or 
corn sirup should be omitted. 

Condensed milk may be used instead of fresh milk. It should 
have water added according to the directions on the can. 

Peanut butter may be used instead of chocolate, using two 
tablespoons of the butter to each cup of sugar in the recipe. 
Like butter or other fat it should be added after the fudge is 
cooked. 

Marshmallows or marshmallow cream may be added to any 
fudge after it has been taken from the fire. One cup of marsh- 
mallow to two cups of sugar is a good proportion. 

Any kind of broken nuts, including coconut, may be added 
to the fudge just before it is turned into the pan. 

Candied cherries, or other fruits, chopped candied orange- 
peel or citron may be added. Dates and raisins are often used. 

Flavoring may be varied to suit. Orange extract is good with 



5o6 

brown sugar, chocolate or molasses. Lemon extract or lemon- 
juice is good in a white-sugar fudge from which the chocolate is 
omitted. 

FUDGE-COVERED DATES 

Cut dates in half, lengthwise; remove the pits and lay the 
halves at intervals on a greased dish. Make fudge according to 
any fudge recipe and drop a teaspoonf ul on each half date. This 
must be done quickly, to avoid letting the fudge harden in the 
pan. The hardening may be delayed by standing the pan in a 
larger one containing hot water. 

PANOCHA 

3 cups brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 

1 cup milk 1 cup nut-meats 

2 tablespoons butter 

Put the sugar and milk into a saucepan and cook to the soft- 
ball stage, or 238° F. Remove from the fire, add butter and 
vanilla, and cool without stirring. When it is lukewarm, beat 
until it is creamy. Stir in the broken nut-meats. Hickory 
nuts, walnuts or pecans are especially nice. Pour into a buttered 
pan and when it hardens mark into squares. 

MAPLE PRALINES 

2 cups sugar 1 cup maple sirup 

Yi cup milk 2 cups pecan-meats 

Boil the sugar, milk and maple sirup until the mixture 
reaches the soft-ball stage (238° F.). Remove from the fire 
and cool. When it is lukewarm, beat until it is smooth and 
creamy. Add any kind of broken nut-meats and drop on 
buttered paper from the tip of a spoon, making little mounds. 

FONDANT 

2 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons corn sirup or 

1 cup water y^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

1 teaspoon vanilla 

Put the sugar, corn sirup and water in a saucepan and heat 
slowly. Do not let it begin to boil until the sugar is dissolved. 
Wash down the sides of the pan with a fork wrapped in a damp 



CANDIES 507 

cloth or else cover and cook for two or three minutes so that 
the steam will carry down the crystals that have been thrown 
on the side of the pan. Remove the cover and continue to boil 
slowly without stirring to the soft-ball stage (238° F.). While 
cooking, keep the cover on part of the time so the steam can 
help to keep the crystals washed down. 

Remove from the fire and pour at once on large platters or 
slabs which have been dipped into cold water, and let it stand 
until it is lukewarm. Stir with a spatula or a fork till it is 
creamy; then knead with the hands until it is smooth and free 
from lumps. 

Fondant is better if allowed to ripen for several days before 
being used. It may be wrapped in waxed paper and put into a 
tightly covered jar. When it is to be used for centers of dipped 
bonbons the centers should be shaped by hand or in molds and 
allowed to stand in the air until the surface loses all stickiness. 
Then the shapes may be dipped into the coating. 

HONEY FONDANT 

2 cups granulated sugar ^ cup honey 1 cup water 

Proceed as for plain fondant. 

CANDIES MADE FROM FONDANT 

Tutti-Frutti — Knead fondant and flavor with cherry or 
almond extract. Knead into it one-third its amount of a mix- 
ture of raisins, dates, figs, candied cherries, citron, orange-peel 
or other candied fruits, which ha^e been chopped together. 
Shape into a flat cake and cut after it stands for an hour. 

WiNTERGREEN Creams — Melt a portion of fondant in the 
upper part of a double boiler until it is soft enough to drop 
from a spoon. It may be necessary to add a few drops of hot 
water. Color it with red vegetable coloring to a delicate pink. 
Flavor with oil of wintergreen. Stir until it is creamy. Drop 
from a teaspoon on oiled paper. 

Peppermint Creams — ^Follow instructions given for winter- 
green creams, but leave the fondant uncolored and flavor with 
oil of peppermint. 

Nut Creams — ^Knead fondant and flavor with almond or 
coffee extract. Knead into it a mixture of chopped nuts or 



5o8 

moist coconut. Shape into balls, squares or other shapes attrac- 
tive for dipping into chocolate. 

Stuffed Dates, and Prunes — Stone dates or prunes and 
stuflf them with fondant which has been colored pink and 
flavored with rose water. A whole nut-meat should be inserted 
with the fondant. 

Chocolate Bonbons — ^Melt very slowly a good quality o£ 
specially prepared dipping chocolate, sweetened or unsweetened, 
in the top of a double boiler. Do not heat the water under the 
chocolate above 120° F., for overheating spoils chocolate for 
dipping. Stir it constantly while it is melting to keep an even 
temperature, and after it has melted, beat it thoroughly. Keep 
the heat very low during the dipping process. To dip centers, 
use a fork or confectioner's dipper. Drop centers in one at a 
time and when covered place on oiled paper. The room in 
which dipping is done should be cool, so that the chocolate may 
harden quickly. 

MARSHMALLOWS 

2 tablespoons gelatin ^ teaspoon salt 

Yx cup cold water 1 teaspoon vanilla 

% cup boiling water Confectioners' sugar 
2 cups sugar 

Soak the gelatin in the cold water until it has taken up all the 
water. Boil the sugar and water to the soft- ball stage (238° 
F.). Add vanilla and salt to gelatin. Pour the sirup slowly 
over the gelatin, beating constantly with a whisk until cool and 
thick. Butter a shallow pan slightly and dust with confection- 
ers' sugar. Turn the marshmallow mixture into the pan and 
smooth the top evenly. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Let it 
stand over night. In the morning cut it into small squares and 
roll in confectioners' sugar. 

VARIATIONS FOR MARSHMALLOWS 

Chopped nuts, dates, figs, raisins or candied cherries may be 
added to the recipe for marshmallows. Plain marshmallows 
may be rolled in coconut before being rolled in sugar, or they 
may be dipped in melted chocolate. Marshmallows may be 
tinted any desired color.

SALTED ALMONDS OR PEANUTS 

Blanch the almonds or remove the thin brown skin from the 
peanuts. Dry the almonds well. Put a small amount of oil 
into a dripping pan, pour in the nuts and stir them until they 
are well coated. There should be no excess oil in the pan; just 
enough to give an oily surface to each nut. Set the pan in the 
oven, and stir the nuts often until they become light brown. 
Drain them in a colander, spread on a platter and sprinkle with 
salt. 

To Blanch Almonds — Shell the nuts and pour boiling 
water over them. Let them stand from two to five minutes, 
until the brown skin can be slipped off with the fingers. Pour 
off the water and remove the skins. 

GLACE FRUITS OR NUTS 

2 cups sugar Small fruits or sections of 

1 cup water larger fruits or whole nut- 
34 cup light corn sirup meats 

Make a sirup of the sugar, water and corn sirup. Boil, with- 
out stirring, to the hard crack stage (300° F.). Remove the 
saucepan from the fire and put it into an outer pan of boiling 
water to keep the sirup from hardening. Drop in the well 
drained fruit or the nut-meats, a few at a time. Skim out and 
place on heavy waxed paper to dry. 

CANDIED FRUITS 

Sirup for Candied Fruits — 

2 cups sugar ^ cup light corn sirup 
1 cup water 

Boil together until the sirup spins a thread when dropped 
from the spoon (234° F.). 

Candied Pears, Peaches, Plums, and Cherries — Pare, 
core, slice or otherwise prepare the fruits to be candied. Have 
them drained clear of all juice and add them to the boiling 
sirup, being careful not to have them crowded. Simmer until 
the fruits are clear. Skim from the sirup, drain, spread on a 



CANDIES 515 

screen and allow them to dry until they are no longer sticky. 
Pack between sheets of waxed paper and place in a tin box or 
a glass jar. 

Candied Quinces, Pineapples and Figs — Prepare fruits by 
washing, paring or slicing as desired, then simmer in clear water 
until tender. Drain and use the water in which the fruits 
were cooked to make the sirup. Proceed as in the preceding 
recipe. 

Candied Orange, Lemon or Grapefruit Peel— Cut the 
peel into halves or quarters. Let them stand over night in salted 
water (one tablespoon salt to one quart water). Drain and 
wash thoroughly. Simmer in clear water, changing the water 
several times until it has no bitter taste. When the peel is 
tender, drain, cut into strips or add whole to the sirup and sim- 
mer until it is transparent. Drain, roll in granulated sugar, and 
allow the peel to dry well before packing. 



FRUIT PASTE CANDIES 

Fruit Paste — Paste may be made from most kinds of fruit- 
pulp after the juice has been drained off for jelly, or it may be 
made from fresh or canned fruit. A combination of the pulp 
of two or more kinds of fruit gives a delicious result. 

Press the pulp through a rather fine strainer, measure it and 
to one pint of pulp add one and one-third cups of sugar. Cook 
this mixture, stirring it and taking care not to let it scorch. 
When the paste is thick and clear, turn it out on a platter which 
has been brushed with unsalted fat. Let it stand and dry until 
a film forms over the top. Then turn it on to a wire screen 
and dry until it loses its stickiness. To get the best results, dry 
it as quickly as possible in the open air. Roll the dried paste in 
thick paraflfin paper and pack it in tin boxes or glass jars for 
future use. For finish, dip in fondant or chocolate, 

SPUN SUGAR 

2 cups sugar 1 cup water 

I/3 teaspoon cream of tartar 

Dissolve sugar in water, bring slowly to boiling point and 



5il 

boil to 280° F. Add cream of tartar and continue boiling with- 
out stirring until the sirup reaches 310° F. In the mean- 
time, have prepared 2 oiled wooden spoon handles securely 
anchored in kitchen-cabinet drawers, with a clean paper spread 
on the floor below. When the sirup reaches 310° F. remove 
quickly to a pan of cold water to stop the boiling, then to pan 
of hot water. Tint with food colors if desired. Dip the spinner 
(a spoon, large knife or egg whip will serve) into the sirup and 
swing back and forth over the handles. The sugar falls in 
long threads. If the sirup thickens as you work, heat the water 
in the lower pan until the sirup melts and continue spinning. 
Use at once as decorative nests for ice cream, meringue glace. 
Baked Alaska or Easter eggs. 



PULLED SUGAR 

2 pounds loaf sugar 1 teaspoon glucose 

1 cup water 54 teaspoon cream of tartar 

Add water to sugar in a saucepan and when completely dis- 
solved turn on heat, add glucose and cream of tartar and boil 
as quickly as possible to 312° F. Remove at once to pan of 
cold water to stop boiling, then pour sirup onto a lightly oiled 
slab. If diflFerent colors or flavors are wanted, divide the sirup 
as desired. As edges cool, lift with knife and turn in to the 
center. When sugar is cool enough to handle, pull from sides, 
turning in to the center, and roll into a ball. Work in a warm 
place so sugar does not cool too quickly as you work and be 
sure that all parts are pulled equally. When it becomes quite 
satin-white and china-like in appearance, start your design. 
Ribbons are made by pulling a straight piece, cutting the edges 
quickly and then arranging in knots or bows. Set aside to cool 
slowly so they will not crack. 

For flowers and leaves, pull a small end into petal shape, pinch 
off the end, work the edges thin and curve into desired shape. 
Put the petals together as you work to form the flower, then 
pinch the lower ends together and attach to a new tin wire, or 
attach to a green pulled-sugar stem. Detached leaves may be 
mounted on wire and left uncovered. 



FRUIT DESSERTS 



Fresh Fruits 

■pRESH fruits are the simplest and easiest of all desserts to pre- 
-*- pare, and furnish one of the most wholesome sweets. They 
are at their best when served ripe and in season. When fruit 
comes from the market it should be looked over and kept in a 
cooi place. All fruit should be washed before it is served. 

FRESH BERRIES 

Turn the berries out of the container and spread them on a 
platter or board so that they are not piled up on one another. 
If there are any noticeably soft or moldy, remove them and 
set the rest in the refrigerator or other cool place until they 
are to be prepared for serving. Then pi.ck them over carefully, 
wash and drain. Strawberries are usually hulled, but when 
very large and perfect they may be served with the hulls on and 
dipped into powdered sugar when they are eaten. 

MELONS 

All melons should be served very cold. They may be laid 
on chopped ice when served but the ice should never be placed 
in or on the edible parts of the melon. 

Cantaloup — Cut the cantaloup in half and with a spoon 
remove the seeds without injuring the flesh. Each half may be 
served alone or it may be filled with fresh berries or other fruit 
or with ice-cream. When used as an appetizer at the beginning 
of a meal, a quarter of a large cantaloup is enough. Chilled 
melon balls are often served. 

HoNEYPEW AND Casaba Melons — ^These are usually cut 
lengthwise and served in sections two or three inches wide. 

Watermelon — To serve a whole watermelon at the table, 
cut it in half, crosswise, and cut a slice from each end to make 
it stand on a platter. Garnish the platter with green leaves. 

The melon may be served in round slices, or in half or quarter 
slices from which the rind may or may not have been removed; 
the pulp may be shaped in badls or dice and served in glasses^ 

517 



Si8 

or it may be scooped out in large spoonfuls and served in a 
watermelon tub shaped from the rind. 

For other suggestions for serving melons, see Index. 

GRAPEFRUIT 

See Index. 

ORANGES 

Cut oranges in half crosswise. With a sharp knife, loosen 
the pulp from the center and from the dividing fiber. Serve 
two halves to each person. 

An attractive dessert is made by cutting oranges crosswise in 
quarter-inch slices and laying the slices in an overlapping row 
on a glass plate, allowing about four slices to each person. The 
slices may be sprinkled with sugar and moist coconut or served 
plain. 

ICED ORANGE JUICE 

Fill small glass cups with strained orange-juice and set each 
in the center of a plate filled with cracked ice. This makes a 
delicious and beautiful fruit course for breakfast. 

STUFFED PEACHES 

Pare large peaches and cut a slice from the top of each. Re- 
move the pits without breaking the fruit and fill the hollow 
with nuts or with any chopped fruit, such as apples, citron or 
raisins. Sprinkle with sugar and a little cinnamon or nutmeg. 
Pour custard over the peaches and bake. Or serve cold soft 
custard with the uncooked chilled fruit. 

SLICED BANANAS 
Chill and slice well ripened bananas, serve with cream or 
lemon-juice and sugar.

small pieces, mix fruit and sugar, and chill for one hour. Serve 
in glasses, adding one tablespoon whipped cream to each glass 
just before serving. A berry or piece of pineapple placed on 
the cream gives color to the dish. 

VERMONT QUARTERED APPLES 

6 firm, tart apples 3 tablespoons butter 

4 tablespoons shaved maple 1 cup boiling water

cook evenly. Carefully remove the skin, scraping the red pulp 
from it and pasting it back on the sides of the apple. Put the 
apples in a serving dish. Boil the sirup down to one cup and 
add the grated rind and the juice of one orange, the juice of 
one lemon, and, if desired, nuts, candied orange peel or raisins. 
Pour sirup over the apples and serve with whipped cream. 

JELLIED APPLES 

Pare and core the required number of apples and bake, steam 
or boil in sirup until tender. Cool. Cover the bottoms of indi- 
vidual molds with lemon jelly, put in apples and cover with 
jelly. Unmold and serve with meringue or whipped cream.

STEAMED APPLES 

Core the apples, fill cavities with sugar and put in a saucepan 
with hot water about an inch deep. Cover and cook slowly, 
turning the apples over once. This will steam the apples and, 
if they are red, will preserve their color. These resemble baked 
apples and the same variations may be used. 

BAKED STUFFED PEARS 

Pare and core large pears and stuff with seeded dates, raisins 
or chopped nuts with some tart marmalade or shredded coconut. 
Place close together in a baking-dish, cover bottom of pan 
with water and bake slowly until tender. 

MERINGUED PEARS 

6 large pears Candied ginger 

6 tablespoons sugar 3 egg-whites 

Grated lemon-rind 54 cup powdered sugar 

Pare and core the pears, place them in a baking-dish and fill 
the center of each with one tablespoon sugar and a little grated 
lemon-rind or candied ginger. Add three or four tablespoons 
of water and bake until tender. Cover them with a meringue 
made with the stiffly beaten egg-whites and the sugar. Brown 
quickly. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Wash, but do not peel, the rhubarb and cut it in one-inch 
pieces. Add one-half as much sugar as rhubarb, put in a sauce- 
pan with just enough water to keep the fruit from burning. 
Very little water is needed, as rhubarb provides its own moist- 
ure. Cook rapidly until tender. 

BAKED RHUBARB 

Prepare as for stewing, using same proportion of sugar and 
rhubarb, and bake in a moderate oven (350° -3 75° F.). Bake 
until the rhubarb is reduced to a soft, red pulp. 

Dried Fruits 

If prepared carefully, most dried fruits retain their flavor. 
Except for some of the vitamins, none of the food values of

the product are lost in drying, for this method of preservation 
only drives off the moisture of perishable foods through evapora- 
tion. The modern method of drying fruit makes it unnecessary 
to soak the present day product. Dried fruits are edible as they 
come from the package, or may be plumped slightly by immers- 
ing in hot water. 

Quick cooking without soaking saves the sugar of the fruit, 
allows a firmer texture and improves the flavor. Rinse the 
fruit, cover generously with water and boil briskly until very 
tender. Apples and apricots require 40 minutes, figs 20-30, 
peaches 50, pears 40, prunes 45-50 and raisins 10. Add sugar 
to taste during the last 5 minutes of cooking to all fruit except 
figs which must be cooked with sugar for at least 15 minutes. 

Stick cinnamon, cloves or lemon juice may be added for flavor 
variety. 

There are endless ways in which dried fruit may be used for 
garnishes, salads, cakes, cookies, breads and desserts. 

APRICOT OR PRUNE WHIP 

1 5/2 cups sweetened apricot Yg teaspoon salt 

or prune pulp ^ cup sugar 

1 Yz tablespoons lemon juice 3 egg whites, stiffly beaten

whites, fold in fruit mixture and serve garnished with chopped 
nuts. If desired this mixture may be piled lightly into a buttered 
baking dish and baked in a slow oven (275° F.) 30 to 45 
minutes.

cinnamon and dash of salt. Cover apples with Yz the mixture. 
After 5 minutes turn the slices with pancake turner to avoid 
breaking. Cover with remaining sugar mixture. Fry over low 
flame until almost transparent. If too well done, they break 
easily. Serve hot. 



CUSTARDS, GELATIN AND 
CREAM DESSERTS 



MOST desserts made with eggs, cream and gelatin, or with 
any one or two of these ingredients, are best served very- 
cold. The mechanical refrigerator is excellent for chilling such 
desserts. 

Custards 

A custard is a mixture of cooked egg and milk, flavored. 
Starchy material is sometimes used to replace part of the eggs. 
Custards are classified according to the method used in cooking 
them; those cooked over hot water and stirred throughout the 
cooking process are known as soft or stirred custards — erro- 
neously, as boiled custards; those set in hot water and cooked in 
the oven (oven-poaching) are firm or baked custards. 

The firmness of a custard depends on the proportion of eggs 
to milk. (See "Useful Facts about Eggs.") The finest-grained 
custards are those in which the yolks predominate. 

If fresh milk is not available, an unsweetened canned milk or 
milk powder may be used with excellent results. 

No. 1. PLAIN SOFT CUSTARD 

2 cups milk Ys teaspoon salt 

2 whole eggs or 4 tablespoons sugar 

4 egg-yolks Yz teaspoon vanilla 

Scald the milk in the top of the double boiler. Beat together 
slightly the eggs, sugar and salt. Add the hot milk to the 
egg mixture, mix thoroughly and return to the top of the 
double boiler. Cook over hot water, stirring constantly until 
the egg coats the spoon. 

No. 2 — If eggs are expensive^ modify the recipe for soft 
custard by substituting one teaspoon of corn-starch for one 
egg-yolk or two teaspoons for two egg-yolks or one whole 
egg. Make the milk and starch into a sauce and cook over hot 
water twenty to thirty minutes before adding any eggs. 

525 



526 



VARIATIONS OF PLAIN SOFT CUSTARD 

Coffee — Use recipe for soft custard, substituting one cup 
of very strong coflfee for one of the cups of milk. 

Caramel — Caramelize one-fourth cup sugar and add to one 
cup scalded milk. 

Follow recipe for soft custard, using this milk with caramel 
as part of the milk, and using in addition the full amount of 
sugar called for in the recipe. 

Chocolate — ^Melt one ounce of chocolate and add to it 
two tablespoons of sugar dissolved in two tablespoons of boil- 
ing water. Mix thoroughly. Add this chocolate mixture to 
two cups of scalded milk and use as the milk in a plain soft 
custard. 

WAYS OF SERVING SOFT CUSTARD 

Soft custard may be served in sherbet cups, frappe glasses 
or deep sauce dishes, garnished with whipped cream and pieces 
of tart jelly. 

It may be poured over fresh fruit. 

It may be poured over lady fingers or sponge cake and may 
then be garnished with meringue or whipped cream. 

It may be served as a sauce for most gelatin dishes. 

It is an excellent foundation for ice-creams. 



FLOATING ISLAND 

2 cups milk 6 to 8 tablespoons sugar 

3 eggs ^ teaspoon vanilla 
Ys teaspoon salt 

Follow directions for soft custard, using two egg-yolks and 
one whole Qgg, Cool and turn the custard into a glass dish or 
into custard cups. Beat the two egg-whites until stiff and beat 
into them two to four tablespoons of fine granulated or pow- 
dered sugar. Drop this meringue by spoonfuls on the custard 
and chill thoroughly. A candied cherry or a small bit of red 
jelly placed on each spoonful of meringue adds to the attractive 
appearance of the dish. 



CUSTARDS, GELATIN, ETC. 527 



CARAMEL PUDDING 

1 cup brown sugar ^ cup flour 

2 cups milk 2 eggs 

Mix sugar and one and one-half cups of milk. Scald in double 
boiler until sugar is dissolved. Mix flour with beaten egg-yolks 
and the remaining half cup of milk and add to the hot milk, 
stirring constantly until it thickens. Remove from fire and fold 
in stiffly beaten egg-whites. Chill and serve with whipped 
cream. 

ORANGE FOOL 

6 oranges Sugar 

3 eggs Nutmeg 

2 cups cream Cinnamon 

Squeeze and strain the juice from the oranges. Beat the eggs 
and add to them the cream and the orange-juice. Sweeten to 
taste. Add a sprinkle of grated nutmeg and powdered cinna- 
mon, and cook in a double boiler, stirring constantly until the 
mixture coats the spoon. Pour into glass dishes and chill 
thoroughly before serving. 

PLAIN BAKED CUSTARD 

2 cups scalded milk Ys teaspoon salt 

3 eggs Yz teaspoon vanilla 

4 tablespoons sugar 

Scald the milk. Mix sugar, eggs, salt and flavoring and com- 
bine with scalded milk. Pour into custard cups or baking-dish 
set in pan of hot water and poach in a slow oven (300° F.) 
until firm. A knife blade run into the center of the custard 
will come out clean. 

VARIATIONS OF BAKED CUSTARD 

Caramel. 

No. 1 — Caramelize one-fourth cup of sugar and add to two 
cups of scalded milk. Use as the liquid in a plain baked custard. 

No. 2 — Caramelize one-half cup of sugar. Pour into a mold 
or pour a little into each of six custard cups. Before it hardens, 
move the mold about so that the caramel will coat the sides. 
Wlien the caramel is hard, fill the molds with plain baked 



528 

custard mixture and bake as directed for baked custard. These 
custards are unmolded and served either hot or cold. The cara- 
mel melts during the cooking process and when the custard is 
turned into a dish forms a sauce around it. 

Cocoa — Substitute cocoa, made as for drinking, for scalded 
milk in baked custard recipe. 

Chocolate — Melt one and one-half ounces of chocolate and 
add to milk. Use in a plain baked custard. 

Coffee — Substitute one cup of strong coffee for one cup of 
milk in baked custard recipe. 



Gelatin and Cream Desserts 
ONE QUART STANDARD GELATIN JELLY 

1 ounce (2 tablespoons) ^ cup to 1 cup sugar (lemon- 
granulated gelatin juice requires more sugar

Yz cup boiling water orange-juice more than cof- 
3 cups other liquid or fruit- fee or cream) 
juice 

Soak gelatin in cold water until soft. Add to boiling water 
and stir over hot water until thoroughly dissolved. The object 
of heating only part of the water is to hasten the cooling and 
solidifying of the gelatin mixture. Add sugar and stir until 
dissolved. Remove from heat. Add remaining liquids or fruit 
pulp and mix thoroughly. Pour into molds that have been 
dipped into cold water. 

STANDARD FORMULA FOR WHIPS 

Use recipe for standard gelatin jelly but leave the mixture in 
the bowl in which it was mixed until it begins to congeal. Then 
whip until it becomes light and frothy. Fold in 1 J/2 cups fruit 
pulp, as prune or apricot. Turn into molds and chill. 

STANDARD FORMULA FOR SPONGES 

Use recipe for standard gelatin jelly with these exceptions: 
use three-eighths cup instead of one-half cup cold liquid; whip 
the congealing jelly and add beaten whites of two eggs after 
jelly begins to congeal. 

Any Fruit Sponge may be made into a delicious semi- 



CUSTARDS, GELATIN, ETC. 529 

frozen dessert by substituting cream for egg-white and chilling 
two to three hours. Three tablespoons cream should be sub- 
stituted for each egg-white in the recipe, the other quantities 
remaining the same. Whip the cream and fold in, following 
directions given for egg-white. 

STANDARD FORMULA FOR CHARLOTTE OR 
BAVARIAN CREAM 

Use recipe for standard gelatin jelly with these exceptions: 
Use one-quarter cup instead of one-half cup cold liquid and

froth. The jelly may be whipped before adding the cream, if 
desired. It makes a more delicate product. 

FRUIT JELLIES, WHIPS, SPONGES, CHARLOTTES 

OR BAVARIAN CREAMS 

Use recipe for orange jelly, orange sponge, or orange charlotte 
or Bavarian cream, substituting one and one-half cups of any 
other fruit pulp or juice for one and one-half cups of orange- 
juice. If stewed sweetened fruit pulp is used, reduce the amount

HOT AND COLD PUDDINGS 



THE temperature at which a pudding is served depends some- 
what upon the nature of the pudding. However, souffles, 
must be served hot because they begin to fall as soon as they are 
taken from the oven; and certain others, such as the steamed 
puddings and baked batters or doughs, become soggy when cold. 
Some puddings may be chilled almost to the point of freez- 
ing, and for these the mechanical refrigerator is very satisfac- 
tory. Use the ring mold for both hot and cold puddings, unmold 
on the serving plate and serve with the bowl of sauce or cream 
in the center. See page 344.

STEAMED PEACH PUDDING 

3 cups peaches 4 teaspoons baking-powder 

2 cups flour 2 tablespoons shortening 
Y2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 

To be successful with this kind of pudding, the cook must 
see that the water is boiling violently when the pudding is 
placed over it and must not allow it to fall below the boiling- 
point at any time while the pudding is cooking. 

Sift the flour, salt and baking-powder together, rub in the 
shortening and add the milk. The result will be a dough too 
soft to roll out. Peel and stone the peaches and cut them into 
rather thick slices. Place the sliced fruit in a greased pudding- 
dish, spread the dough over the fruit and set the dish in a 
steamer over a kettle of rapidly boiling water, covering the 
steamer tightly. Steam for one hour. Turn the pudding out 
without breaking. This brings the peaches uppermost, when 
the pudding is sent to the table. Serve with hard sauce or any 
liquid sauce.

pear cavities with one-half the fresh raspberries or strawberries, 
crushed and sweetened. Pour the remainder of the crushed^ 
sweetened berries over the rice and pears. A spoonful of 
whipped cream with each serving is a great addition to this 
dish.

tablespoon of cold water. Warm the milk, sugar and vanilla 
slowly, stirring constantly, until lukewarm (110° F.) — not 
hot. A few drops of milk on the inside of your wrist should 
feel only comfortably warm. Remove from stove. If desired, 
add small pinch of salt. Add dissolved rennet tablet and stir 
quickly for a few seconds only. Pour at once, while still liquid, 
into dessert glasses. Let set until it thickens — about 10 minutes. 
Chill rennet-custards in refrigerator. Serve in same glasses. 



HOT AND COLD PUDDINGS 555 

Rennet-custards may be served with a sauce made of a mixture 
of sweetened fruits such as bananas, cooked or canned pine- 
apple, oranges and dates or crushed and sweetened berries. They 
may also be served with chocolate or caramel sauce. 

VARIATIONS OF RENNET-CUSTARDS 

Chocolate — Melt one ounce of chocolate over hot water.

FROZEN DESSERTS 



Ice Creams 

ICE CREAMS are generally classified as cooked or uncooked. 
All ice-creams are stirred or beaten while freezing. 

Plain or Philadelphia Ige Cream — ^This is cream, or 
cream diluted with milk, sweetened, flavored and frozen. Plain 
ice-creams may be flavored with extracts or may have crushed 
nuts or fruits added. Rich, oily nuts do not combine well with 
ice-cream. "Walnuts, almonds, pecans and pistachio nuts are 
most often used, and crushed peaches, pineapple, apricots or 
berries are particularly good for flavoring. 

Bisque Ice Cream — ^This is made by adding to plain ice- 
cream such material as pulverized macaroons, ground nuts and 
stale sponge cake crumbs, to give variety in texture and flavor. 

French and American Ice Creams — ^In these, the founda- 
tion is a custard made with cream, milk, eggs, sugar and flavor- 
ing, cooked, chilled and then frozen. In French ice-cream the 
custard mixture contains many eggs. In American ice-cream a 
plain custard is used. 

Neapolitan Ice Cream — ^This may be made of any variety 
of ice-cream tinted in three colors and variously flavored. It is 
packed in layers after it is frozen. Sometimes it is made of a 
combination of ice-cream and water-ice. 

Frozen Pudding — ^This is plain ice-cream plus a combina- 
tion of fruit and nuts with bread-crumbs, cake-crumbs or 
powdered macaroons. 



Mousses, Parfaits and Biscuits 

Mousses — ^A mousse is whipped cream, sweetened, flavored, 
packed, and frozen without stirring. Gelatin is often used to 
give body to a mousse. In that case it is sometimes spoken of 
as a frozen souffle. Chocolate, coffee, maple and fruit flavors 
of various kinds are used. 

Parfaits — A parfait is made by pouring a hot, thick sirup 
over beaten egg-yolks or beaten egg-whites, adding whipped 
cream, and packing and freezing the mixture without stirring. 

557 



558 

Chocolate, maple and cotfee are the most popular flavors for 
parfaits. 

Biscuits — ^A biscuit is a yellow parfait mixture to which 
beaten egg-whites are added. It is stirred until it is partly 
frozen and then packed in small paper serving cases. The cases 
are laid in the trays of the mechanical refrigerator or in con- 
tainers which are placed in a freezing mixture. 

Water Ices, Sherbets, Bombes and Punches 

All these mixtures are stirred while being frozen. 

Ices — ^A plain ice is a sweetened fruit-juice which may or 
may not be diluted with water. 

Sherbets — A sherbet is a plain ice plus egg-whites. Gela- 
tin is sometimes used in sherbets. In milk sherbets, milk, instead 
of water, is used with the fruit-juice. 

Bombes — A bombe is a combination of two or more frozen 
mixtures, packed in layers in a covered mold. 

Punches — ^A punch is a water-ice frozen to a mush with 
some highly spiced fruit-juice or other flavoring added. 

Sorbets — A sorbet is a sherbet made of several kinds of fruit. 

Equipment for Making Frozen Desserts 
The Crank Freezer 

This type of freezer consists of a bucket of wood or metal 
for holding the freezing mixture, ice and salt, and a non-rust- 
ing metal container with a dosely fitting cover for holding 
the mixture to be frozen. The mixture in the container is 
stirred by a paddle attached through the cover to a crank 
which is operated by hand or which may be attached to a small 
electric motor. 

Ice Crusher — ^A bag of heavy muslin, burlap, canvas or sail- 
cloth is required to hold the ice while it is broken into small 
pieces. Some implement is necessary for pounding the ice in 
the bag. A wooden mallet is generally preferred because it 
crushes the ice more thoroughly and quickly than a smaller im- 
plement. Very satisfactory mallets and bags for breaking ice 
can be bought. 

The Freezing Mixture — One part salt to eight parts 
crushed ice, by measure, is a good proportion for home use. The 
ice should be crushed fine, to expose as much surface as possible 



FROZEN DESSERTS 559 

to the action of the salt. Snow may be used instead of ice, but 
it is advisable to mix a small amount of water with the snow to 
hasten the melting process. Rock salt is best for use in freezing. 
Mix the ice and salt before putting them into the freezer, and 
fill the freezer well above the line of the mixture in the ice- 
cream container. 

The Automatic Freezer 

This variety of freezer requires no turning. The wall of the 
outer compartment is constructed with an air-space which helps 
to keep the warm air from entering and the cold air about the 
ice from escaping. The ice-cream is placed in the smaller con- 
tainer, covered and packed in ice and salt in the larger container. 
At intervals the cover is removed and the contents scraped from 
the side and beaten well with a spoon or paddle. It requires 
the minimum amount of ice and work to do the freezing and 
the frozen product is of a satisfactory quality, although not so 
smooth as that made by the freezer in which the mixture is 
stirred while freezing. 

The Automatic Refrigerator 

For speedy freezing, the temperature in the ice-making 
drawer of the refrigerator must be under twenty degrees. Your 
refrigerator is designed to keep foods at an even low tempera- 
ture, and the freezing of desserts is an extra service. If yours 
will not freeze them, it is possible to have a switch added which 
will keep the motor operating continuously during the freez- 
ing period, or the valves may be readjusted to give the whole 
box a lower temperature. 

No one, however, should be allowed to make adjustments or 
tamper with the valves except the electrician sent out by the 
salesman. 

Preparation of Ingredients 

Use More Flavoring in all mixtures that are to be frozen 
than in mixtures that are to be served unfrozen, because the 
flavor freezes out to some extent. Stir well and thoroughly 
dissolve sugar before freezing. 

Crush Fruit for fruited creams or put it through a food- 
chopper. Large pieces of icy fruit are difficult to eat. Partly 
freeze the mixture before adding the fruit, otherwise the milk 
or cream may curdle and the fruit may settle to the bottom. 



56o 

Scalding (not boiling) at least part of the cream and milk 
will give greater body and finer grain to ice-cream than it will 
have if the cream and milk are used without this preparation. 

Chill the Mixture before beginning to freeze. The best 
temperature is about 40° F. It should never be over 60° F. 
If it is too warm the cream may curdle before freezing. 

Freezing Ice Cream 

To Freeze Ice Cream in a Crank Freezer, have the ice- 
cream container not more than three-fourths full. The turning 
of the crank incorporates air in the mixture and the freezing 
causes expansion, so allow plenty of room for "swell." Place 
the can containing the mixture in the freezer pail. Cover the 
can and adjust the top. Turn the crank to be sure that the 
cover fits tight. Add the ice and salt mixture as directed. Turn 
the freezer slowly until the mixture begins to freeze ; then turn 
it more rapidly. This beats up the cream and produces a swell. 

Ice cream takes from twelve to twenty minutes to freeze in 
a crank freezer. Ices and sherbets take from twenty to thirty 
minutes. 

To Freeze Ice Cream in a Vacuum Freezer, pack in 
the same manner as when a crank freezer is used. Several times 
during the two hours that are necessary for freezing, remove 
enough ice so that you can uncover the can without danger of 
salting the cream; scrape the mixture from the sides of the can 
with a spoon or paddle and beat thoroughly. 

For Quick Results with the Automatic Refrigerator, 
take these precautions: 

1. Chill your mixture well before freezing. 

2. Do not try to freeze pans of water at the same time with des- 
serts. 

3. Do not open and close your refrigerator doors often or place 
warm, steamy foods in the box while you are freezing desserts. 

4. Do not have the mixture too sweet or it will not freeze. 

Ice cream mixtures having a heavy custard base respond very 
well to the automatic refrigerator. It is best to cook only the 
yolks of the eggs, then chill, and finally fold in the beaten 
whites just before freezing. This method not only gives a 
better texture but a greater volume to the finished product. 

Refreshing and palatable sherbets may be frozen in the auto- 



FROZEN DESSERTS 561 

matic refrigerator, but they are likely to be granular even when 
gelatin and beaten egg-whites are added. 

Ice-creams and sherbets, and all other frozen desserts having 
a custard or gelatin foundation should be very vigorously stirred 
one hour after being placed in the refrigerator to freeze, and 
several times subsequently at half to three-quarter-hour in- 
tervals. 

The addition of whipped cream does much to make the tex- 
ture fine and smooth. Crushed fruit, marshmallows, grape nuts 
and crumbled graham crackers will also make desirable textures. 

Recipes which are especially good for refrigerator freezing 
are: rennet-custard ice cream, maple-fruit ice cream, peach ice 
cream — No. 2, prune ice cream, raspberry ice cream, chocolate 
ice cream, frozen pudding, peach meringue, maple mousse, 
strawberry mousse, maple parfait, biscuit glace, charlotte glace 
and marshmallow mousse. 

In all of these recipes, except the rennet-custard ice cream, 
the cream must be whipped. In making chocolate ice cream, add 
the whipped cream when the mixture is half frozen. 

Packing and Molding Frozen Desserts 

Ice-cream is ready for packing when it has a dull appearance, 
adheres to a spoon and retains its shape for some time. By 
thermometer test it should be about 27° F. It should be firm 
and mellow, smooth and velvety, free from grains or lumps 
and neither tough nor mushy. Ice-creams and ices that are 
to be molded should be packed into the molds at this time. 

To Pack Ice Cream in the Freezer, drain off the brine 
and pack the can in coarse cracked ice and salt. Use one part 
salt to four of ice by measure. Cover the top of the can with 
a layer of ice about six inches thick. Cover the top of the 
freezer with newspapers or burlap or any other covering that 
will exclude air. Set the freezer in a cool place and let it stand 
two or three hours, for the ice-cream to ripen. 

When Frozen Mixtures are to be Molded, have the mold 
chilled and ready when the mixture is frozen to the point where 
it is ready for packing. If it is allowed to freeze too hard before 
it is packed into the molds, it is difficult to handle. 

Pack the Mixture Into the Mold Carefully, so that 
all curves and corners are filled compactly without air spaces; 



562 

fill the mold to overflowing with the frozen mixture and cover 
with a sheet of white paper. 

Press the Cover Down Tight and seal the crack with a 
thick layer of some fat that is hard when it is cold. The crack 
must be completely covered. Bury the mold in cracked ice 
and salt, using four parts of ice to one part of salt, by measure. 

In Packing a Mousse or Parfait, use equal measures of 
salt and ice and let the mold stand from three to five hours, 
depending on its size. 

When Using the Automatic Refrigerator, pack the 
mixture into the trays. Allow four hours for freezing, until 
you find that your refrigerator will freeze more quickly. 

Paper Cases May be Filled with chilled or partly frozen 
mixtures. These may be placed in a closely covered receptacle 
and packed in ice and salt or placed in the trays of the auto- 
matic refrigerator. 

Double Molding — Line the mold with a frozen mixture, 
making the layer equally thick in all parts. Fill the center 
with a mixture of contrasting color or texture or both. This 
mixture may or may not have been frozen first. 

Unmolding Frozen Desserts 

To unmold a frozen dessert, remove the mold from the ice 
mixture, rinse off the salt with cold water, break the seal, re- 
move the cover and run a knife around the edge of the mold 
to a depth of not more than one-half inch. Invert the mold 
on a serving-plate. Let it stand for a few minutes and the 
contents will soon slip out. If it does not come out easily, dip 
a cloth into lukewarm (not hot) water wring as dry as possible 
and wipe quickly over the outside of the mold. 

Suggestions Concerning Flavor and Texture 

The Amount and Quality of Flavoring Extracts used 
are very apparent in the finished product. Some of the flavor 
freezes out, so an allowance must be made for this. The flavor 
should be delicately suggested rather than too pronounced. 

The Amount of Fat in the Cream also affects the flavor. 
A rich cream has a better flavor than a 'thin cream. 

Salt Added in Small Quantities — not more than one- 
half teaspoon to a gallon of the cream mixture — ^serves to give 
a "rounded out" or deeper flavor. 



FROZEN DESSERTS 563 

Ice Cream Should Stand Several Hours to ripen or blend 
the many flavors of the eggs, sugar, fruit, nuts, chocolate, and 
other substances found in the product. Each flavor may be 
distinguished in freshly frozen ice-cream. 

If a Colored Product is Desired, only a small amount o£ 
coloring should be used. A delicate tint is all that is desired. 

Texture is Affected by Whole Cream, egg-white, gela« 
tin and cooked combinations such as milk and corn-starch or 
flour, and milk and eggs. A smooth velvety texture is desired. 
Other things being equal, a richer mixture gives a smoother 
product. A thin cream gives a coarse texture. 

Texture is Also Affected by the Manner of Freezing. 
If the mixture is frozen too rapidly, it will be coarse and have 
a rough texture, while a slower freezing tends to improve its 
texture. This smoothness is not entirely due to the rate of freez- 
ing, however, but to the amount of whipping or beating which 
takes place before and during the freezing. If frozen without 
any beating, the product will be coarse even though made from 
a rich cream. The air that is beaten into the mixture in freez- 
ing produces a light smooth consistency. 

A Certain Amount of Expansion is Desirable. If ice- 
cream is properly made, the volume increases at least one-third 
and the product is smoother in texture and richer to the taste 
than in a cream containing no air. Too rapid freezing prevents 
this increase of volume.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING FRESH 
FRUIT ICE CREAM 

Prepare any desired fruit by sprinkling sugar over it. Let it 
stand one hour, press through a coarse sieve and stir into vanilla 
ice-cream, American (page 563), when the cream is frozen to 
a mush. 

If Seed Fruits,^ such as currants or berries are used, strain 
through a fine sieve or a piece of cheese-cloth and use the pulp 
only. This can be put into the freezer with the cream and not 
reserved until later, as in the case of the mashed fruits. 

Crushed Pineapple with the addition of a little lemon- 
juice makes a particularly fine fruit cream.

ICE CREAM SANDWICHES 

Between thin slices of devil's food, angel cake, sponge cake 
or butter cake, or between halves of eclair or cream-puff shells, 
place a serving of ice-cream of a flavor to blend well with the 
cake. Cover with chocolate, butterscotch, marshmallow, maple 
or fruit sauce, either hot or cold, and top with whipped cream 
and nut-meats of various kinds, moist coconut, powdered or 
granulated chocolate or pieces of fresh or canned fruit. 

For example: (1) Between thin slices of gold or white cake, 
place a slice of vanilla ice-cream; over the whole pour plain 
marshmallow sauce or whipped cream and garnish with several 
tablespoons of crushed strawberries. (2) Fill a cream-puff shell 
with peach ice-cream and pour over it a peach sirup, topped 
with whipped cream. (3) Place chocolate or vanilla ice-cream 
between layers of white or angel cake and cover with a thick 
fudge sauce. 

SUNDAES 

Vanilla, chocolate or any other ice-cream served in a low 
glass, with sweetened crushed fruit or any desired sauce poured 
over it, is known as a sundae. Whipped cream, nuts, marsh- 
mallow cream, etc., may be added as a garnish.

PASTRY AND MERINGUES 



PASTRY may be defined as a stiff dough made very short 
by means of some kind of fat. It is iised for pies and tarts 
and for some other dishes. There are two kinds of pastry; 
plain pastry and puff pastry. 

Plain Pastry is usually used for pies. It may be made 
either crisp and crumbly or light and flaky. 

Puff Pastry is not used for under crusts of pies because it 
rises or puffs up too much. It is sometimes used for rims wh^re 
extra height is desirable, or for upper crusts of rich pies. It 
is used for tarts of various kinds, for cases, such as patty shells 
and vol-au-vents, to hold creamed mixtures, and for various 
shapes which are frosted or otherwise decorated for serving with 
afternoon tea or as desserts. It may be cut into points to take 
the place of toast as a garnish. 



General Directions for Making Pie Crust 

Mixing — Pie crust shotild be handled as little as possible. 
Sift together the flour and salt (and baking powder, if used) ; 
work in the shortening according to the directions for the 
different kinds of crust, and add the water gradually, always 
pouring it upon dry flour and working the mixture only enough 
to obtain a paste that will cling together in a mass and leave 
the sides of the bowi clean. 

Amount of Water — ^This cannot be given definitely, be- 
cause it will vary with the dryness of the flour and the amount 
of shortening used. If much shortening is used, less water is 
needed, because fat is liquid at oven temperature and so is 
counted as liquid. The paste should be soft enough to roll out 
smoothly without breaking at the edges. Use cold water, pref- 
erably ice-cold, if you wish a flaky pastry. 

Chilling — If the paste is chilled before it is rolled, it will 
be easier to handle and lighter when baked. Allowing a short 
interval between mixing and rolling the paste permits a more 
complete absorption of water, and this too contributes to ease 
in handling the paste. 

Thickening a Paste That is too Soft — If the paste is 

585 



586 

made too soft to roll, it can be thickened by working into it 
a combination of flour and shortening in the proportion of one 
tablespoon of shortening to four tablespoons of flour. This 
keeps the proportions of shortening, flour and water correct 
and a good result will be obtained. If flour only is added, the 
paste will be tough and hard. 

Rolling — Sprinkle flour over the mixing board and rolling 
pin and rub it into the wood as much as possible. Sometimes 
a stiff, closely woven cloth is used as a cover for the board and 
rolling pin and flour is rubbed into it. The mesh of the cloth 
holds more flour and gives it up more slowly than the bare 
wood, thus making it possible to handle a softer dough upon 
the cloth than upon the board. 

Place the paste upon the floured board and toss it quickly 
over and over to coat the surface with dry flour. Pat into a 
round, flat shape, and roll out with light, quick motions of the 
rolling pin. Heavy pressure makes the paste stick to the board 
and breaks the surface, which should be kept smooth. When 
the rolling pin comes to the edge of the paste, it should roll off 
into space, not on to the board. The edges of the paste should 
not be pinched, but should be of the same thickness as all other 
parts. 

In making a pie crust, keep the paste in circular form. An 
expert pastry maker can roll the paste so that it will exactly 
fit the pie tin without need of trimming. The under crust 
should be thick enough to support the filling when the pie is 
baked; that is, between one-eighth and one-quarter inch thick. 

The Lower Crust — ^When the paste is the right size, place 
the rolling pin across it, fold one-half of the paste over the 
pin, lift the paste over the pan and carefully shift it into posi- 
tion. Or, fold the paste double and lift it on to the pan with 
your hands. Fit it carefully down into the curve, being care- 
ful not to enclose air. If there is too much paste around the 
edge, trim off the excess with a knife or by pressing against 
the edge with your hands. If only one crust is to be used, 
crimp the rim with a pie crust crimper, with the ends of a fork, 
with the side of the thumb, or with thumb and finger. If you 
desire a deeper pie than the pan provides, make the edge stand 
upright by fluting it or make a double rim by adding another 
piece of paste cut to fit the rim.

giness of the under crust of juicy pies are coating the surface 
with egg-white, dusting with dry flour and partly baking the 
crust before putting in the filling. 

The Upper Crust — ^If an upper crust is necessary, roll it as 
directed for the under crust, but make it thinner and smaller. 
Score a design on it. It is not necessary to cut the design clear 
through, as the lines will break sufficiently in baking to allow 
the steam to escape and thus prevent puffing of the upper crust. 
After the filling is put in, moisten the rim of the under crust 
with cold water and lift the upper crust into place. Press the 
crusts carefully together around the rim, trim oflF any excess, 
and, if you wish, mark the rim as suggested for under crusts. 

To Prevent Escape of Juices — ^If the filling is very juicy, 
it is wise to bind the edge of the pie with an inch -wide strip 
of muslin dipped into water or vegetable tape, used as directed. 
A little flour paste will hold ends together. Remove the strip 
after the pie is baked. Or, cut the upper crust one-half inch 
larger in diameter than necessary, and turn the excess under 
the edge of the under crust, previously moistened. Press the 
crusts together and mark them as you wish. 

Pie and Tart Shells — Crusts baked before filling are done 
over the bottom of an inverted pan, between pans, or filled to 
y^ their depth with dry b^ns or rice. When inverted the dough 
should be pricked to allow air bubbles to escape. 

Ready-to-Use Piecrust Mixtures 

Piecrust mixtures containing all the required ingredients 
except cold water, are procurable in several excellent brands. 
These make pie making a simple and quick matter. They are 
particularly valuable for the small family. 

Baking Pastry 

Place pastry in a hot to very hot oven (400°-500° F.) so 
that the shortening will be cooked into the flour without first 
becoming oily. If the shortening becomes warm and oily be- 
fore going into the oven, or after being put into the oven^ 
the pastry will be tough or hard instead of crisp or flaky. When 
the crust begins to brown, the temperature may be reduced. 
(See table of cooking periods and temperatures, page 6.) 

Some fillings, such as lemon, chocolate and cream fillings.

are cooked and put into a baked crust. This insures a dry, 
crisp or flaky under crust. Some custard pies are made in this 
way, but the flavor is not so good as when the uncooked custard 
is put into the uncooked crust and both are cooked at the 
same time. 

General Directions for Making Grainy or Crumbly 

Piecrust 

It is easier to make a good grainy or crumbly piecrust than 
it is to make the flaky crust. It is not so important that in- 
gredients be cold and it makes no particular difference what 
kind of shortening is used ; it may be one of the solid fats or one 
of the vegetable oils; it may be melted before it is used, and 
hot water may be used instead of cold water. The fat is mixed 
quite thoroughly with the flour in making this sort of crust, 
and it need not be cut in with two knives, as with flaky pastry 
— ^in fact, the finger-tips may be used for this mixing. The 
heat of the fingers melts the fat a little, but this is no particular 
disadvantage with this kind of pastry. 

For crumbly piecrust, pastry flour, rather than ordinary 
bread flour, is an advantage and a smaller amount of fat can be 
used with the hot-water method. 

Baking-powder, one-fourth teaspoon to a cup of flour, has a 
tendency to make the crust more tender. 

GRAINY OR CRUMBLY PIECRUST 

Plain — 

iy2 cups flour ^ cup shortening 

14 teaspoon salt 3 to 4 tablespoons cold water 

Sift flour and salt. Mix in fat with fork or finger-tips until 
the mixture has about the consistency of corn-meal. Add water 
gradually, tossing the moistened lumps of dough aside, so that 
the water may reach the dry material. When the dough clings 
together so that the bowl is clean, chill, remove two-thirds of 
it to a slightly floured board and roll out, keeping the paste as 
nearly circular as possible. Use this for the lower crust. For 
the top crust of a two-crust pie, use the remaining paste with 
the trimmings of the lower crust. This amount should make 
two shells of medium size, or one two-crust pie. 

With Vegetable Oil — Use oil in the proportion of Yz cup 



PASTRY AND MERINGUES 



589 



oil to 254 cups flour with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Mix the 
shortening into the sifted dry ingredients with a fork. Less 
water is necessary to make the dough cUng together. Otherwise 
the method is the same. 

With Hot Water— No. 1. 

II/2 cups flour 1/^ cup shortening 

y^ teaspoon baking powder 4 tablespoons boiling water 

1/2 teaspoon salt 

Sift flour, baking powder and salt. Mix in fat with fork or 
finger tips and stir in the boiling water. Cool before rolling. 

No. 2. 

II/2 cups flour 4 tablespoons boiling water 

y^ teaspoon baking powder y^ cup shortening 

Y2 teaspoon salt 

Pour the boiling water over the fat and beat with a fork 
until it becomes a smooth liquid. Sift the flour, baking powder 
and salt into this mixture. Stir together, chill and roll out.^ This 
mixture keeps well in the refrigerator. 

With Cornstarch \ 

% cup cornstarch 1 teaspoon baking powder 

1]^ cups flour 6 tablespoons shortening 

1 tablespoon sugar 1 tgg yolk 

1 teaspoon salt Cold water 

Mix and sift all the dry ingredients. Rub in shortening with 
a fork or finger tips and add beaten tgg yolk while stirring. 
Add water gradually till paste will hold together. Chill and 
roll out. 

With Almonds — 

114 cups flour Yj teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons pulverized 14 cup shortening 

almonds 1 tgg 

3 tablespoons sugar Cold water 

Mix dry ingredients and rub in fat. Add beaten egg and 
water to hold paste together. Cool and roll out. 

Almond crust may be used for custard pie or any of its varia- 
tions, for fresh fruit or dried fruit pies, for lemon pies, or for 



590 

pumpkin, squash or sweet-potato pie. The crust is especially 
good for tarts, which may be filled with jelly, marmalade, 
fruit or whipped-cream mixtures. 

General Directions for Making Flaky Piecrust 

To make a flaky piecrust more pains must be taken than 
in making the crumbly crust. Very soft fats and oils do not 
make as nice a flaky crust as the firmer shortenings. Bread 
flour may be used very satisfactorily. 

In Mixing the Ingredients be sure that they are cold, 
particularly the shortening and water. Do not use the finger- 
tips for mixing. The heat of the fingers softens the fat. Cut 
the shortening into the flour with two knives, rather quickly, 
and do not mix it very thoroughly; leave it in lumps or thin 
slices which will roll out to make layers or flakes. 

There are Three Methods of Making Flaky Crust. 
The third one is particularly good when you want to cut down 
the amount of shortening used. It is harder to mix and of 
course the crust will not be as rich as one in which a larger 
amount of shortening is used, but it is not tough. 

A Hot Oven is Especially Important in baking a flaky 
crust. Layers of cold air have been incorporated into the crust 
and the heat of the oven expands this air quickly, making the 
crust light. 

It is Important to Prick Flaky Crust before baking it. 
Otherwise it may puff too much in one place. 

No. 1. FLAKY PIECRUST 

11/2 cups flour 14 c^P shortening 

14 teaspoon salt 3 to 4 tablespoons cold water 

Sift flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with two knives. 
Do not mix as thoroughly as for crumbly pie cru5t, but leave 
shortening in small lumps or slices. Roll lightly and bake 
quickly in a hot to very hot oven (see table of cooking periods 
and temperatures, page 6) . 

No. 2 — ^Use proportions given in No. 1. Mix as in that 
recipe, reserving one and one-half tablespoons of the shorten- 
ing. Roll the paste out, spread with half the reserved shorten- 
ing, roll up like a jelly roll and roll out with the pin. Spread 



PASTRY AND MERINGUES 591 

with the remaining shortening, roll up and roll out again. If 
necessary sprinkle the board with flour to keep the paste from 
sticking. 

No. 3 — Use same proportions of flour and salt as in preced- 
ing recipes. Reduce the amount of shortening as much as one- 
half , if desired. Mix flour, salt and shortening as directed above. 
Take out one-half of the dry mixture. Add water to the re- 
mainder. Roll out in circular form. Place one-third of dry 
part in a row across the center of the dough and fold over from 
each side to make three layers. Turn half way round and roll 
out. Repeat twice more, until all of the dry mixture is used. 
Bake as usual. 

PUFF PASTE 

1 pound butter or other Ice- water 

shortening 14 ounces bread flour or 

2 teaspoons salt 1 pound pastry flour 

(The usual proportions are a pound of flour to a pound of 
shortening. ) 

If salted butter is used, wash it to remove the salt. To do 
this, wash the hands in water as hot as possible, rinse in cold 
water and knead the butter in ice-water in a scalded bowl until 
all the salt is drawn from it. At first the butter will crumble 
but when free from salt it will cling and mass together. Pat 
and fold till dry and in a compact mass. Reserve two table- 
spoons of it and put the rest in the refrigerator till needed. 

Work the two tablespoons of shortening into the flour with 
the tips of the fingers. Moisten carefully with ice-water, and 
turn the dough out on a slightly floured board. Pat it smooth 
and divide into halves. Roll out each half to the same size and 
thickness. Over one sheet sprinkle a little flour. Take the 
remaining shortening from the refrigerator and make into a 
sausage-like roll, dredge with flour and roll out very thin as 
nearly like the sheets of dough in shape as possible. Flour the 
board and rolling-pin so that shortening will not adhere. Place 
the shortening between the two sheets of dough and roll as thin 
as possible without allowing the fat to break through. When 
the sheet becomes thin, fold in the sides until they meet, turn 
one-half way about and roll out. Fold and roll in this way 
twice and place in the refrigerator for fifteen minutes. Repeat 
rolling and cooling until dough has been rolled and cooled four 



592 

times. If not needed for immediate use, it may be wrapped 
in a towel and left in the refrigerator from twelve to twenty- 
four hours and will be even lighter and more flaky than when 
freshly made. 

Puflf paste may be made without cooling, but it is lighter and 
rises better when the above directions are followed. The layers 
in puff paste are made by folding and rolling, incorporating air 
which, expanding with the heat, makes the paste rise. 

An important factor in the making of puff paste is to have 
the oven at the proper temperature. The paste should be very 
cold when put into the oven, and the oven should be very hot, 
about 500° F. (cooled later to 450° F. or lower). 

For Patty Shells, the oven should have a strong underheat, 
allowing them to rise to their full height before browning. If 
the oven is too hot, so that the paste begins to brown as soon 
as put inj immediately reduce the temperature. 

To Glaze Puff Paste — ^When a brown, polished finish is 
desired, the pastry is brushed with egg mixed with one table- 
spoon of cold water to each egg. The egg must not be beaten 
until frothy, but merely enough to make it mix with the water. 
Where gloss but no color is desired, the white of the egg alone 
may be used; the yolk gives the yellowish brown tinge. 

SUET PASTE 

1 teaspoon baking-powder 1 cup chopped suet 

2 cups flour 1 cup cold water 
Yz teaspoon salt 

This paste is excellent for boiled fruit pudding and dumplings 
or for baked or boiled meat pies. All the ingredients must be 
very cold. Sift the baking-powder with the flour, add the salt, 
suet and water and mix into a smooth, firm dough. Chill and 
roll out. 



APPLE PIE 

4 to 6 tart, juicy apples 1 teaspoon lemon-juice 

1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon or nut- 

1 teaspoon butter meg, if desired 

Line a pie-pan with any plain crust and fill with thinly 
sliced apples. Add the sugar, lemon-juice, and spice, and dot 



PASTRY AND MERINGUES 593 

with the butter. Cover with a top crust, making it a little 
richer than the under one. This is easily done by rolling in 
bits of shortening and folding the paste several times. Cut a 
few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake about 
forty minutes in a hot oven (450° F.) reduced after ten min- 
utes (to 425° F.). 



ENGLISH DEEP-DISH APPLE PIE 

6 to 8 tart, juicy apples ^ cup water 

1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon or nut- 

1 teaspoon butter meg, if desired 

Invert a heavy china cup or a custard cup in the center of 
a baking-dish two to three inches deep. Line the sides of the 
dish with strips of pie paste, letting the paste come a little 
above the edge of the dish. Do not put any paste on the bot- 
tom. Fill with apples, pared, cored and cut in slices. Add 
sugar, spice and water, and dot with bits of butter. Cover the 
dish with pie paste, slashed to allow the steam to escape, and 
pinch its edge to the edge of the paste that lines the sides of 
the dish. Bake for three-quarters of an hour, or imtil the 
apples are thoroughly cooked, in a hot oven (450° F.) for ten 
minutes then 425° F. for thirty minutes). When serving, slip 
the knife under the cup to allow the confined juice to mix with 
the apple. Serve hot with hard sauce. 



APPLE OR PEACH MERINGUE PIE 

1 quart prepared fruit 3 tablespoons powdered sugar 

1 teaspoon nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 

3 egg-whites 

Stew the fruit and sweeten to taste. Mash, and season with 
nutmeg. Line a pie-pan with paste, turn in the filling and bake 
without an upper crust, for forty minutes in a hot to slow oven 
(450° F. for ten minutes, then reduced to 325° F.). Add 
powdered sugar and vanilla to stiffly beaten egg-whites. Spread 
over the pie and put back into the oven till the meringue is 
browned. Serve cold. This amount makes one pie.

The common sour red cherries are the best for pies. Line a 
deep pie-pan with good plain paste, fill nearly full with stoned 
cherries, sprinkle with sugar, sifted with the flour. 

Cover with an upper crust, which should be rolled as thin 
as possible, make a vent in the center, and press the edges to- 
gether so that the juices will not escape during the baking.

Then reduce the heat to 325° F. and bake until a silver knife 
inserted in the center will come out clean (about thirty min- 
utes). These quantities will make one thick pie or two thin 
pies.

PUMPKIN PIE 

1/4 cups prepared pumpkin 1 teaspoon salt 

34 cup brown sugar 2 eggs 

1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups milk 
}4 teaspoon ginger 

Steam or bake fresh pumpkin and put it through a sieve. 
Canned pumpkin is ready to use. Add remaining ingredients 
in the order given. Turn into a crust-lined pan and bake. 
Use a high temperature at first (450° F.) to cook the bottom 
and sides of crust. Reduce the temperature and continue cook- 
ing at 325° F. until a silver knife inserted in the center will 
come out clean. Do not let the pie boil, as that will make it 
watery. 

A delicious addition is one-half cup of fine chopped nut- 
meats. Whipped cream and a tart jelly are also very good with 
pumpkin pie. 

SQUASH PIE 

The yellow, hard-shelled squash makes almost as good pies as 
pumpkin and is often easier to obtain. Use the proportions

given for pumpkin pie, adding two tablespoons of butter, be- 
cause squash is not so oily as pumpkin. Stew, steam or bake the 
squash about one hour and be sure that it is as dry as possible. 
Baking insures this more easily than does any other method of 
cooking. 

SWEET POTATO PIE

Turn into a pan lined with crust. Cover with top crust and 
bake in a very hot oven (450° F.) for ten minutes, then re- 
duce the heat sHghtly (to 425° F.) and continue cooking for 
about thirty minutes longer.

minutes longer. Remove from the oven, cover with a meringue 
made of the egg-whites and powdered sugar, and return to a 
slow oven (300°-350° F.) to brown. 

PASTRY SHELLS 

No. 1 — Roll plain or puff paste thin and cut with a biscuit- 
cutter. With a smaller cutter remove the centers from one- 
half of these circles and lay the rings thus made on the whole 
circles, in this way building a wall around the shell. Bake in a 
quick oven (400°-450° F.). When these shells are used, small 
pans are not required. With puff paste, if a deep shell is de- 
sired, remove the centers from two circles and lay both rings on 
top of the uncut circle. 

No. 2 — Invert patty pans or muffin tins, cover with crust 
and bake in a quick oven (400°-450° F.). Patty cases made 
in this way make very attractive individual pies, a varia- 
tion from the usual large pies. They may be made ahead of 
time and warmed in the oven to freshen them. Any pie mix- 
ture, fresh or canned fruit, jelly, marmalade, or whipped cream 
mixed with nuts and fruits may be used for filling. Do not 
fill the shells until just before they are to be served. The 
moisture in the filling will soften the crust if they stand too 
long. Use the cookie cutter for cover decorations. 

APPLE TARTS 

5 apples y^ cup granulated sugar 

Yz cup cold water 2 tablespoons butter 

^ eggs 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

if desired. Line patty-pans with paste, fill them with the mix- 
ture, dot with butter and bake in a hot oven (400°-450° F.).

Meringues 

A meringue is a very light, delicate preparation made by 
beating white of egg until stiff and fine grained. It is sweetened, 
and may or may not be flavored otherwise. 

Egg Whites for Meringues — Good storage eggs give satis- 
factory results, but if eggs are too stale the whites are somewhat 
liquid and will not beat up well. Such eggs, therefore, are un- 
desirable for meringues, although they may be usable for other 
purposes. 

Varieties of Sugar for Meringues — ^The sugar for me- 
ringues may be powdered, fine granulated or brown. It should 
be sifted to free it from lumps and to keep it from being com- 
pact. 

Proportion of Sugar to Egg White — ^For pie and pud- 
ding meringues, use from one to three tablespoons of sugar to 
each egg-white. For kisses and meringue shells, use from four 
to ^ye tablespoons of sugar to each egg-white. 

Methods of Making Meringues 

No. 1 — ^Beat the egg-whites until stiff, then add the sugar 
gradually, continuing the beating until the mixture is fine 
grained and will hold its shape. 



PASTRY AND MERINGUES 613 

No. 2 — Add the sugar to the unbeaten egg-whites and beat 
both together. 

With Either Method, if more than three tablespoons of 
sugar is to be used for each egg-white, beat two-thirds of it in 
as directed, and fold the last third carefully into the mixture. 
More beating may make the egg-white fall. 

Methods of Using Meringues on Pies, Tarts and 
Puddings 

These may be used in any of the following ways: 

No. 1 — Spread the meringue evenly over the surface, using 
a knife or the back of a spoon. 

No. 2 — ^Make the surface imeven by spreading in ridges or 
by making points. 

No. 3 — Make fancy shapes by using a pastry bag and tube» 

No. A — Put the meringue on by the spoonful. This is de- 
sirable for some puddings, as it is then easy when serving the 
pudding to have a nicely shaped meringue for each serving. 

No. 5 — ^Bake the meringue for puddings by itself. To do 
this, float spoonfuls of the mixture upon hot water in a shal- 
low pan. Set the pan in a slow oven (300°-350° F.) and 
bake until the meringues are lightly browned. Skim them off 
immediately and place upon the prepared pudding. 

In Spreading Meringue over the surface of a pie or pud- 
ing, be sure that it touches the pastry rim or baking-dish all 
around or it will shrink away from it in baking. 

Temperatures — ^All meringues should be baked in a slow 
oven. For meringues baked on pies or puddings, the correct 
temperature is300°-350°F. 

Cooking Periods — Bake pie and pudding meringues from 
dight to ten minutes, depending upon the thickness of the 
meringue. They should rise and be delicately browned.

MERINGUE FOR KISSES 

(Directions for making kisses and larger meringues, baked 
alone, are given on page 499.) 

Creole Kisses — ^Fold 1 cup finely crushed nut brittle into 
meringue mixture; shape in small mounds. 

Meringue Glaces — Shape mixture in large mounds. When 
baked, scoop out centers with spoon and place in oven to dry. 
Just before serving, fill shells with ice cream, crushed fruit or 
cream filling; serve with a dessert sauce (page 579) as desired. 

Nut Glaces or Shells — ^Fold 1 cup finely chopped nut 
meats into mixture before shaping into large mounds. Use Eng- 
lish walnuts, pecans, hickory nuts, toasted blanched almonds, 
pistachio nuts or cashews. 

Date and Walnut Meringues — ^Fold 1 cup each chopped 
dates and broken walnut meats into meringue mixture. With 
teaspoon shape in small mounds. 

Meringue Nests with Peaches — ^Prepare 1^4 times the 
recipe. Cover bottoms of medium-sized muffin pans with un- 
glazed paper; do not grease. Pack with meringue, cutting with 
knife to remove air pockets. Bake for 1 to 1 54 hours. Remove 
while warm and scoop out soft center from underside; then cool. 
Just before serving, fill with fresh peaches, sweetened with pow- 
dered sugar, and top with a hood of whipped cream. Substitute 
other fruits for peaches as desired. Yield: 10 meringues. 



FRENCH RECIPES 



The Institute secured these excellent recipes directly from French 
kitchens. They have been selected for those who are interested in real 
French dishes. The secret of French cooking (except for sweets) is the 
use of a whif of garlic. Even when it does not appear in the recipe, 
bowl, baking dish or food is usually rubbed with it.

HOT AND COLD BEVERAGES 



Coffee 

THE standard kinds of coffee on the market today are Mocha, 
Java, Bogota, Rio and Santos. Although only about three 
per cent of the coffee used in the United States is actually from 
Mocha or Java, these names represent grades that are regularly 
for sale. 

Buying CoflFee 

The size of the coffee bean is not important, since that differs 
with each variety; the color, however, may be, because this indi- 
cates the amount of roasting to which it has been subjected. 
A light-colored bean is likely to be mild in flavor; a medium 
one, somewhat stronger; while a very dark one may be bitten 

If possible, purchase unground coffee and grind it at home 
as it is needed. It is much more economical to use finely 
ground coffee, because more strength can be obtained from a 
given amount than from that which is coarser. If one has 
equipment for using pulverized coffee, that will be the most de- 
sirable. 

Caffein-Free Coffees — Coffees from which most or all 
of the caffein has been extracted are on the market. These are 
sold imder trade names. Together with cereal beverages they 
are used by those who prefer them to coffee or who may find 
coffee too stimulating. 

Instantaneous Coffees consisting of finely pulvferized 
coffee which may be dissolved in boiling water are available 
for campers and those who want a quick cup of coffee. 

Storing Coffee 

As coffee loses its strength when it is exposed to the air, it 
should be kept tightly covered, especially after it has been 
ground. When coffee has lost its flavor from exposure to the 
air, it can be improved by heating the dry coffee in a frying- 
pan, taking care not to let it burn. The flavor, however, will 
not be so good as the original flavor.

Methods of Making CofiFee 

The most delicious cotfee is made with water just below the 
boiling-point. Many of the percolators and drip co£fee-pots on 
the market are planned on this principle. Coffee should be 
served as soon as it is ready; if it has to stand, the pot should be 
tightly covered and the spout should be plugged with cotton 
or tissue, so that none of the aroma will be lost. 

For weak coffee, tise 1 level tablespoon coffee to 1 cup water. 

For medium coffee, use 2 level tablespoons coffee to 1 cup 

water. 

For strong coffee, use 3 level tablespoons coffee to 1 cup water. 

Filtered or Drip Coffee — ^There are many coffee-pots on 
the market for making filtered coffee. They all contain some 
sort of a strainer which allows the water to drip through the 
coffee very slowly. Pulverized coffee should be used for this 
method. Place the coffee in the strainer and pour boiling hot 
water over it. If the infusion is not strong enough, refilter it. 
Serve immediately. Glass tricolators of oven glass ware are 
excellent for making filtered coffee, as they hold the heat well. 

Boiled Coffee — Put the coffee into the pot with the white 
of an egg or some egg-shells and a little cold water and stir all 
together thoroughly. Pour boiling water over it and place on 
the stove. Cover the spout of the coffee-pot or stuff it with 
paper to preserve the aroma. As soon as it boils up, reduce the 
heat and allow it to settle. A quarter of a cup of cold water 
poured in will cause the coffee to settle more quickly. Do not 
allow it to become muddy by careless pouring. To avoid this, 
decant it into a hot serving-pot. 

Percolated Coffee — ^Use the correct size percolator for the 
number to be served. Measure fresh-running cold water into pot 
to same number of cups. Measure coffee, finely ground or pul- 
verized, into the basket, using 1 heaping tablespoonf ul to cup of 
water. Use medium heat or flame until percolating begins, then 
lower flame and continue for 8 to 10 minutes, when the liquid 
in the glass cap is light brown or deep amber. Serve at once. 
Prolonged percolating dissipates the fine aroma and flavor. 

AFTER-DINNER COFFEE 

The best after-dinner coffee is made with a filter. If really 
black coffee is desired, use three tablespoons of finely ground 



HOT AND COLD BEVERAGES 637 

cotfee to each cup of freshly boiled water. Wet the strainer 
in cold water before adding the coffee. Pour the boiling water 
slowly upon the coffee, and leave the pot over the heat while 
the water is finding its way through the fine grains and absorb- 
ing their flavor. When all the liquid has dripped through, the 
coffee is done and should be served at once. 



VIENNA COFFEE 

Make after-dinner coffee and serve in demi-tasses topped with 
stiffly whipped cream. Sugar may be used if desired. This 
style coflfee is best suited to afternoon or evening service, al- 
though it is adapted for after-dinner service as well. Serve 
with small cakes. 

CAFE AU LAIT 

Make medium or strong coffee by the drip or percolator 
method and while it is being prepared scald an equal amount 
of fresh niilk. Pour the coffee and hot milk together into the 
cups in equal amounts, one pot in each hand. 

TURKISH COFFEE 

Use finely pulverized coffee. Mix one tablespoon of coffee 
for each demi-tasse with an equal amount of granulated sugar. 
When the water is boiling briskly, add the coffee, and when it 
looks frothy remove from the fire. In a moment or two, boil 
it up again and repeat a third time. It should be thick and 
foamy. Serve at once, without cream, as the last course at din- 
ner or luncheon or as a refreshment in the evening with small 
cakes. It is too strong to serve in cups any larger than demi- 
tasse. 

ICED COFFEE 

Make coffee of desired strength — it should be fairly strong, 
as the ice dilutes it. Cool it and serve in tall glasses with 
cracked ice; or pour the hot coffee over cracked ice, in glasses, 
adding more ice if needed. Top the glass with whipped cream 
or vanilla ice-cream. Cream may be poured on the ice before 
the coffee is added, and the coflFee may then be topped with 
whipped cream. 



638 



Cereal Beverages 

Grains, roasted so that they produce a brown infusion,- 
similar in appearance to coffee, are obtainable in several brands. 
These furnish a hot beverage for many who do not care for 
or cannot drink coffee or tea. They are excellent breakfast 
beverages for children and young people. Directions for pre- 
paring them are given on the packages. 

Tea 

A cup of tea with its delicately fascinating aroma is one of 
the most delicious beverages, but probably no other is attended 
with such doubtful results, chiefly because the average person 
knows little about the selection of teas, and methods of brewing 
it are uncertain. 

Varieties of Tea 

Teas divide into three groups according to the method used 
in preparing them for market. 

Unoxidized or Unfermented— These include the green 
teas, an example of which would be the Japan pan-dried tea. 
The leaves are greenish and the tea made from them is light 
colored and delicate in flavor. 

Partly Oxidized or Partly Fermented — ^These include 
the Oolong and Ceylon varieties. The leaves are brown and 
the tea made from them is darker in color than that made from 
the unfermented leaves and has a characteristic aromatic flavor. 

Oxidized or Fermented — These are known as black teas, 
such as English Breakfast or China Congou, and India teas such 
as Darjeeling and Pekoe. The leaves are black and the beverage 
has a rich dark color and a fruit flavor. 

During oxidation or fermentation, chemical changes take 
place which improve the flavor and reduce the amount of 
tannin, the substance which gives tea its astringency. As green 
teas are not oxidized, they contain a larger proportion of tannin 
than the others and consequently have a more astringent flavor. 

Buying Tea 

Buy tea that has well-curled leaves and that is free from 
stems or dust. In preparing tea for marketing, the leaves are 
withered or steamed and then rolled by hand or machinery. 



HOT AND COLD BEVERAGES 639 

This extracts some of the juice, which dries on the leaf and 
makes it more easily soluble when the tea is steeped. The twist 
of the leaf due to this rolling helps to secure this dried juice. 
Tea with very large leaves, dusty tea or tea in which stems are 
found in abundance is of poor quality and even though offered 
at a reduced price is bad economy, as a large quantity must be 
used to produce even a fair flavor. 

Storing Tea 

Tea will absorb moisture and odors, and the volatile oil, to 
which it owes much of its flavor, will evaporate. Store tea, 
therefore, in tightly covered cans and in a cool place. 

Best Method of Making Tea 

Glass or earthenware pots are by all means to be preferred 
in making tea; metal is to be avoided if the best flavor is de- 
sired. If two pots are not available, some arrangement by which 
the tea leaves can be removed from the pot is necessary. Some 
pots come equipped with strainers. 

Tea May Be Put in a Tea-Ball or a muslin bag and taken 
out when sufficiently steeped. These containers should be not 
more than half full, to allow the tea leaves room to swell and 
to give off the amount of flavor of which they are capable. 

Making Tea in a Cup with the aid of a tea-ball or strainer 
is not to be encouraged, as the tea does not steep long enough 
and the flavor and aroma are dissipated. 

The Quantity of Dry Tea to Use in proportion to water 
is not fixed; it depends on the grade of tea and the strength 
desired. An old rule reads, "a teaspoon of tea to a cup," and 
it is an excellent one to use when trying a new tea; but most 
people will find that it is not necessary to use as much as this. 
The housewife must experiment with her particular kind, and 
suit it to the tastes of the individuals drinking it. 

The Method of Making is not so variable. Experts insist 
that there is only one way. Freshly boiling water is necessary, 
otherwise the tea is flat and insipid. Pour the boiling water on 
the required amount of leaves in an earthen or glass pot. If an 
infusion is desired with a maximum of aroma and a minimum 
of tannin or astringent flavor, allow it to brew for three min- 
utes, then remove the tea container or pour off the liquor into 
another warm pot and serve at once. More "body" is given by 



640 

longer brewing, due to extraction of more tannin. Five min- 
utes should be sufficient time. 

Tea May Be Served With Sugar, cream or milk, lemon, 
cloves, candied cherries, orange-peel or rose leaves and mint. 
Black teas are best to serve with cream. 

ICED TEA 

Make tea in the usual way. The clearest iced tea is made 
by pouring the hot liquid over cracked ice rather than by cool- 
ing it slowly and chilling in the refrigerator. If it is to be 
poured over cracked ice, it must of course be made doubly 
strong, as the ice dilutes it. 

Chocolate and Cocoa 

Chocolate is made from cocoa beans that are ground under 
pressure. It is sold in the unsweetened form, such as we com- 
monly use for a beverage, and also sweetened and flavored. If 
chocolate is stored in a warm room, the fat known as cocoa 
butter will melt and come to the surface, and when it hardens 
will give the chocolate a gray look, because the fat is prac- 
tically white. The cake of chocolate, however, is as good to 
use as ever. The instantaneous chocolates found on the market 
are combinations of cocoa, flavoring, sugar and often milk 
powder. 

Cocoa is the ground bean from which part of the fat has 
been extracted. It should be a rich reddish brown in color. 
If it is very dark, it is usually because it has been artificially 
colored or made from imperfectly cleansed beans or those of 
a poor quality. 

Cocoa is a valuable food and is an excellent medium by which 
to introduce milk into the diet. Because it contains a stimulant, 
it is best to use a minimum of cocoa and a maximum of milk 
when giving it to children. 

Cocoa preparations, in which cocoa, sugar, powdered milk 
and malt are used, make quickly prepared beverages. 

The method of making all beverages containing cocoa is 
based on the fact that cocoa is rich in starch; therefore cocoa 
boiled for £ve minutes has a much better flavor than that which 
is made by simply adding it to scalded milk, because cooking 
improves the flavor of all starches. 



HOT AND COLD BEVERAGES 641 



COCOA 

2 to 3 tablespoons cocoa 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar 

54 cup water Ys teaspoon salt 

1 quart milk 

Stir cocoa, sugar and either hot or cold water together and 
boil over the fire for five minutes; add salt. Scald the milk in 
a double boiler; add to the cocoa mixture and stir until well 
blended. Or, add cold milk to the cocoa mixture after boiling 
for five minutes and let it stand over hot water until hot and 
well blended. Beat with a rotary egg-beater to make foamy 
before serving. Whipped cream or marshmallows may be served 
with cocoa. 

CHOCOLATE 

2 squares unsweetened 3 tablespoons sugar 
chocolate 3 tablespoons water 

4 cups milk 

Scrape the chocolate fine, mix it with the water and heat 
over hot water until the chocolate is melted. Bring the milk 
to the scalding point (in a double boiler), add the chocolate 
and the sugar, stir untiUissolved and whip with an egg-beater 
until the beverage is light and frothy. 

ICED CHOCOLATE 

Make chocolate or cocoa as usual; cool and serve in tall glasses 
with chopped ice, topped with sweetened whipped cream. 

RECEPTION CHOCOLATE 

1 quart milk Yz cup sugar 

Yz cup cocoa Y2 teaspoon vanilla 

Y4 cup flour Ys teaspoon salt 
1 quart water 

Mix dry ingredients and make a smooth paste with some of 
the water. Pour on the remainder of the water and boil slowly 
for fifteen minutes. Combine with the milk, bring to the boil- 
ing-point. Add vanilla. Serve with whipped cream. This is 
a very thick, rich cocoa which is improved by standing over 
hot water an hour or more. 



642 



Fruit Beverages 

Fruit beverages are particularly valuable in the diet. They 
should be served more frequently than any of the others except 
milk. The time has passed when we think of them as only 
for formal or semi-formal occasions or for the warmest Summer 
days. They offer most desirable minerals, are rich in vitamins, 
and, because of the sugar used to sweeten them, are fairly high 
in fuel value. Most of the fruit-juices have a wholesome laxa- 
tive effect. In the Summer they make refreshing drinks; 
through the "Winter, the juices that have been bottled during 
the warmer months plus the fresh juices available from the 
citrus fruits are a source of vitamins and minerals, which may 
be so lacking in the diet at that time; and in the Spring they 
are most valuable stimulants to the jaded appetite. The tang 
of their acid flavor and their attractive color make them wel- 
come additions to the table. 

Grape-juice, pineapple-juice, tomato-juice concentrated 
grapefruit- juice and orange-juice, etc., for making fruit bever- 
ages, may be bought in bottles or cans. 

Combinations of Fruits — Any combination of fruit-juices 
will make a successful beverage provided some of the more tart 
juices, such as those from lemons, sour oranges, apple cider or 
rhubarb, are present to give the necessary acidity. 

Sugar Sirups — A beverage sweetened with a sugar sirup is 
better than one to which unmelted sugar has been added. The 
sirup gives a smoother texture and is easily mixed through the 
whole drink, while sugar has a tendency to sink to the bottom. 

The amounts of sugar given in the recipes can not be exact, 
as the sugar must vary according to the acidity of the fruit and 
individual taste. 

Utensils — It is best to use silver, glass or stainless steel in 
cutting fruit, or for pressing or stirring the juices. Some metals 
give a metallic flavor to the beverage. Utensils of glass, china, 
enamel or wood are the most desirable to use for holding the 
juices. 

Chilling — ^Fruit beverages may be chilled by putting 
cracked ice into the beverage or into a bowl in which the con- 
tainer holding the beverage is set. Ice cubes made in the trays 
of the mechanical refrigerator are excellent for chilling bever- 
ages.

FOODS AND BEVERAGES 
FOR INVALIDS 



A DOCTOR'S advice is necessary in planning the diet for 
an invalid, as each case must be considered individually. 
The following general suggestions are intended to help the 
housewife who, in addition to her other work, has the duty of 
ministering to the needs of the sick and convalescent. 

The Proper Selection and Preparation of food for an 
invalid is important, but the best cooked and most palatable 
food may be spoiled in the serving. When possible, remove 
all bottles and suggestions of medicine from the room. Use a 
light tray, and serve everything as nicely as possible — the hot 
things really hot; the cold dishes cold, not lukewarm. In ill- 
ness, even more than in health, care in serving is imperative, for 
appetite may be poor. 

Meals Should be Served at Regular Intervals, and al- 
though the patient should not be consulted about the food to 
be brought J:o him, his likes and dislikes should be considered 
as far as possible. 

Before Serving the Meal, be sure that the patient is ready 
for it, with hands and face washed ; and that provision has been 
made for placing the tray where it will be convenient for him 
or his attendant to reach it. Special raised trays or bedside 
tables may be bought; or a rest may be improvised by placing a 
block of wood or a bundle of magazines on each side of the 
patient so that he will not have to bear the weight of the tray 
on his knees. 

The Tray Should be Covered with a clean napkin oi^tray 
cover, and the dishes and serving should be very dainty. A 
flower or sprig of green will often take an invalid's mind from 
the food, and the attractiveness of the whole will tempt him to 
eat what would otherwise remain untouched. Serving the meal 
in courses will add to the interest. Place the courses on the 
tray in the order in which they are to be eaten and within easy 
reach of the patient. Do not serve too much of any one food. 
Invalids will often take liquid diet through a straw and enjoy 
it after the glass has become tiresome. 

650 



FOODS AND BEVERAGES FOR INVALIDS 651 

Remove the Tray and Dishes as soon as the patient has 
finished eating. In contagious diseases, sterilize everything used 
in the sick-room by boiling in water for ten minutes. 



Milk and Egg Dishes 

MILK 

Hot — Heat the milk quickly over direct heat, stirring con- 
stantly, and serve at once. Heat the cup before pouring in 
the milk, and cover it with a saucer for carrying to the sick- 
room. Hot milk is a mild stimulant in cases of extreme fatigue. 
Cooked milk will agree with many persons who cannot take 
raw milk. 

Diluted — ^If milk disagrees with a patient it may sometimes 
be made more digestible by diluting it with barley water, oat- 
meal water or any good carbonated water, in the proportions 
of two tablespoons or more of the water to one cup of milk. 

Albumenized — 

1 egg-white Yz cup cold milk 

2 tablespoons cracked ice Pinch of salt 

Beat the egg-white with a fork or egg-beater, add ice, milk 
and salt. Beat or shake enough to mix well. 

Artificial Buttermilk. 

1 quart skimmed milk 54 cup water 

1 buttermilk tablet 

Pasteurize the milk (See Index) and cool it to body tempera- 
ture. Dissolve the tablet in the water, and add this to the milk. 
Mix thoroughly and stand covered in a warm place for twenty- 
four hours, or until a solid curd is formed. Keep in a cool place 
until needed. Beat smooth with a rotary egg-beater or shake 
thoroughly just before serving. 

Kumiss. 

1 quart milk 1]^ tablespoons sugar 

J4 yeast-cake 

Heat the milk to 75° F., add the sugar and the yeast-cake 
dissolved in lukewarm water. Fill sterilized bottles to within 
one and one-half inches of top, cork tightly and shake. It 



652 

may be necessary to tie the corks on the bottles, as the yeast 
causes the milk to ferment and if gas is produced in considerable 
amounts the corks are forced out. Invert the bottles and place 
where they can remain at a temperature of about 70° F. for 
ten hours. Place in the refrigerator inverted and let stand for 
twenty-four hours, shaking now and then to prevent the cream 
from forming in the mouth of the bottle. If left standing too 
long, it becomes less palatable. It should look like thick foamy 
cream when ready to serve. In opening the bottle care must 
be taken not to let the milk foam over. 

WHEY 

"Whey is the water solution of milk sugar, salts and minerals 
which forms the basis of fresh whole milk and which is sepa- 
rated from the curd and fat as follows: 

^ rennet tablet 1 cup fresh whole milk 

1 tablespoon cold water 

Dissolve rennet tablet in water. Warm milk slowly, stirring 
until lukewarm — not hot (120° F.). A few drops of milk on 
the inside of the wrist should feel comfortably warm. Remove 
milk from stove. Add dissolved rennet tablet and stir quickly 
for a few seconds, then let stand unmoved until firm. While 
warm, cut curd gently into coarse pieces to separate from the 
whey and strain carefully through fine bleached muslin (72 to 
76 mesh). Sweeten and flavor if desired. Serve as the doctor 
orders, 

With Lemon- Juice — 

1 cup hot milk 2 teaspoons sugar 

2 tablespoons lemon-juice 

Add lemon-juice to hot milk and let stand over hot water 
until the milk separates. Strain through a double thickness of 
cheese-cloth and add the sugar to the whey. 

With Orange-Juice — Substitute orange-juice for lemon- 
juice and use one-half the sugar in the recipe for lemon whey. 

EGGS 

Steamed — Put a piece of butter in an oatmeal dish, remove 
the tea-kettle lid and set the dish over the boiling water. When 
the butter is melted, break an Qgg into the dish, and cover with 



FOODS AND BEVERAGES FOR INVALIDS 653 

the tea-kettle cover. The egg will cook in a few minutes, will 
keep hot, and may be served in the same dish. This is also an 
easy way of scrambling eggs without changing the dish. 

For Other Ways of Serving Eggs to Invalids look in the 
index for the following recipes: Coddled Eggs, Poached or 
Dropped Eggs, Battered or Scrambled Eggs, Shirred Eggs, Baked 
Eggs, Egg Timbales, Egg Toast, Scalloped Eggs, Creamed Eggs, 
Eggs a la Goldenrod, Plain Puffy Omelet, Plain French Omelet, 
Cream Omelet, Oyster Omelet, and others, depending on the 
condition of the patient to be served. 

EGG DRINKS 

Albumen Water — No. 1. 

1 egg-white Sugar 

1 cup ice-water 1 tablespoon lemon-juice 

Stir the white of an egg with a sliver fork, and add the water. 
Serve plain or sweeten and flavor with lemon- juice. Mix well. 

No. 2. 

2 teaspoons sugar 1 egg-white 
Yz cup warm water ^ Pinch of salt 

2 tablespoons lemon-juice or Crushed ice 

3 tablespoons orange-juice 

Dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Add lemon-juice. 
Beat egg-white enough so that it will mix; add salt and put 
with remaining ingredients. Shake or beat the mixture. Strain, 
and serve with cracked ice. 

See Index for Egg Lemonade, Egg Orangeade, Eggnog, etc. 



Cereal Dishes 

In preparing any of the grain foods for an invalid, take 
special care to see that they are well cooked. In some cases the 
cereal may be put through a sieve or puree strainer. Wliole- 
grain foods are important laxative articles of diet. 

BANANA GRUEL 
Stir banana meal into hot milk, and add sugar to taste. 



654 



OATMEAL PREPARATIONS 

For oatmeal gruel and oatmeal water when the prepared oat 
flour is used, follow the directions for barley gruel and water. 
They may, however, be made from either coarse oatmeal or 
rolled oats. If the latter are used, they should be prepared as 
described in the chapter on cereals, (See Index) using the fol- 
lowing proportions: 

Oatmeal Gruel — 

y^ cup rolled oats or J/3 cup coarse oatmeal 1 Yz cups water 

Oatmeal Water — 

1 Yz tablespoons rolled oats or 2 tablespoons coarse oatmeal 
2 cups water 

Oatmeal Jelly — 

4 tablespoons rolled oats or 5 Y2 tablespoons coarse oatmeal 
1/4 cups water 

BARLEY PREPARATIONS 

Barley Gruel, No. 1. 

1 tablespoon barley flour 1 Y2 cups boiling water 
IY2 tablespoons cold water Salt 

Mix the flour with the cold water. Add the boiling water 
gradually, stirring constantly, and boil hard for thirty minutes. 
Salt to taste. Strain through a very fine sieve. 

No. 2^Use the same ingredients as for No. 1 but decrease 
the boiling water to one cup and add one-half cup of hot milk 
to the gruel when serving. 

Barley Water, No. 1. 

2 teaspoons barley flour 2 cups boiling water 

1 tablespoon cold water 

Follow directions for barley gruel. 

No. 2. 

2 tablespoons pearl barley 1 quart cold water 

Wash the barley, and soak for five hours or over night in the 
cold water. Cook until it has boiled down to a pint. Strain 
twice. 



FOODS AND BEVERAGES FOR INVALIDS 655 

Barley Jelly — 

2 tablespoons barley flour 2 cups boiling water 

4 tablespoons cold water 

Follow directions for barley gruel. Strain into a mold, chill, 
and serve with sugar and cream. 

INDIAN-MEAL GRUEL 

2 tablespoons corn-meal 1 quart boiling water 

1 tablespoon flour Yz teaspoon salt 
4 tablespoons cold water 

Mix the meal and flour with the cold water, rub smooth, and 
stir the paste into the boiling water. Stir well, and when the 
gruel boils, lower the heat so it will simmer gently for two 
hours. Add the salt, cook for one-half hour longer, and serve 
with cream or milk. 

PANADA 

Boiling water 2 soda or graham crackers 

Place the crackers in a bowl, and add just enough boiling 
water to soak them well. Set the bowl in a vessel of boiling 
water, and let it remain twenty or thirty minutes, until the 
crackers are quite clear, but not broken. Lift them out care- 
fully without breaking and lay them on a hot saucer. Salt if 
necessary. Serve very hot with sugar and cream. 

RICE JELLY 

2 tablespoons rice flour Salt and sugar 

1 cup boiling water Cinnamon or lemon-juice, if 

Cold water desired 

Mix the rice flour with enough cold water to make a thin 
paste, and then add the boiling water. Sweeten and salt to 
taste, and boil until the rice flour is transparent. Add a little 
cinnamon or lemon-juice as flavoring, if desired. 

Wet a mold with cold water, pour in the jelly, and when 
cold serve with milk or cream and sugar. 



656 



FLAXSEED LEMONADE 

4 tablespoons whole flaxseed 4 tablespoons sugar 

1 quart boiling water Juice of 2 lemons 

Simmer the flaxseed in the water for an hour or more. Strain, 
add sugar and lemon- juice, and serve hot. 



CHICKEN BROTH 

1 fowl (3 pounds) 2 tablespoons sago or tapioca 

2 quarts cold water or rice 
1 teaspoon salt 

Wash the chicken and remove all the skin and fat. Cut It 
into small pieces, crack the bones well, and place it in a kettle 
with two quarts of cold water and let stand one-half hour. Set 
the kettle on the fire in a slow heat, add the rice, and gradually 
bring the water to the boiling-point. Keep it simmering for 
three hours, with the kettle tightly covered. Season with salt, 
skim off fat, strain off the broth, and serve. If made the day 
before using, the soup may be allowed to cool, when fat may 
be more easily removed. 

BEEF JUICE 

Broil one-half pound round of beef, cut about four inches 
square and an inch thick, until both sides are browned and the 
meat is well warmed through to start the juices. Two minutes 
should be sufficient. Sprinkle with salt, cut in pieces, place in a 
presser, lemon-squeezer or potato-ricer and squeeze out all the 
juice. One-half pound of beef yields two ounces or four table- 
spoons of juice. 

Sufficient juice for two servings is generally prepared at one 
time. Warm the second serving over boiling water, stirring the 
juice constantly until it is a little more than lukewarm and 
serve at once. 

Beef Tea — Place 1 pound lean, ground beef in a fruit jar. 
Add 1 pint cold water, and let stand 1 hour. Place jar in a 
saucepan of cold water with a cloth on bottom of pan under 
the jar, and heat water slowly to 140° F. Do not let it boil. 
Contint^e two hours, then slowly increase heat until beef tea 
turns a deep chocolate color. Add J/z teaspoon salt. 



HIGH ALTITUDE COOKING 



'T^HE boiling point of water is called 212° F. but actually that 
"*■ temperature is reached only at sea level. For every 500 feet 
ascent tlie boiling point drops one degree. As altitudes rise in 
this country from sea level to 12,000 feet, food boils at 202° F. 
in Denver, and 1 9 8 ° F. in Laramie. 

Simple boiling processes are carried on by the use of a pressure 
cooker or a sealed steamer as indicated under vegetable cookery 
(pages 386 to 388). In the baking of meats and vegetables oven 
heat can be regulated without regard to altitude. Above 7,000 
feet, additional time must be allowed. The little book called 
"Vegetable Cookery at High Altitudes" by Emma J. Thiessen 
of the University of Wyoming will be found valuable. 

Candy and frostings can no longer be tested by temperature 
because the soft-ball stage, which is 236° F. up to 1,000 feet, is 
226° F. at 3,000 feet, 223° F. at 5,000 feet, and 220° F. at 
7,000 feet. The other stages also occur at lower temperatures 
as the altitude rises. Testing consistency of the sirup by the 
finger or the saccharometer is the way out. 

High altitude does the greatest damage to the baking proc- 
esses, particularly to those baked foods containing sugar, non- 
yeast leavening, and shortening. 

Marjorie W. Peterson of Colorado State College has made a 
careful study entitled "Baking Quick Breads and Cakes at High 
Altitudes," giving recipes for sea level with their necessary varia- 
tions for 3,000 to 11,180 feet. Miss Peterson calls attention to 
some general requirements for all high levels. Cake and bread 
flours should be used exactly as indicated and not interchanged. 
Reductions in the amounts of sugar and baking powder as well 
as fat must also be made as the altitude rises, and while these 
bear a certain ratio per thousand feet, they are not regular. 
The modern woman living in high altitudes would do well to 
buy Miss Peterson's booklet.

CANNING, PRESERVING AND 
JELLY MAKING 



TO Preserve Foods by Canning we must do two things. 
First, we must provide sufficient heat to destroy all mi- 
crospic life that will cause spoilage in food; and, second, we 
must provide a perfect seal vhich will prevent the re-entrance 
of micro-organisms. These problems of preventing spoilage 
have been practically solved by the improved methods of 
canning which are explained below. 

METHODS OF CANNING 

The open-kettle or cooked-in-the-kettle and the cold-pack or 
cooked-in-the-can are the two methods of canning now com- 
monly used. 

Description of the Open Kettle Method 

The open-kettle method is so called because the food to be 
canned is completely cooked in a kettle before it is poured into 
the jar. This method involves more risk than the cold-pack, 
because, unless the jar, the cover, the rubber, and all the utensils 
that come in contact with the food have been thoroughly steril- 
ized by being boiled for several minutes before the jars are filled, 
and unless the work is carefully done, there is always the risk 
that the canned food will be infected and that it may spoil 
after the jar has been sealed. For some products, however, 
such as thick preserves and conserves, for which more intense 
heat than that of boiling water is needed, the open-kettle method 
must still be used. Many persons, too, prefer the open-kettle 
method for canning strawberries and tomatoes. It is not ad- 
visable to use it for non-acid vegetables or meats. 

Description of the Cold-Pack Method 

In the cold-pack method the uncooked or partly cooked 
food is packed in the jars, covered with water, sirup, or ice; 
and both the jar and its contents are heated simultaneously by 
boiling water or steam. This method is recommended for most 

658 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY IvIAKING 659 

fruits and all vegetables and meats, because it is not only a safer, 
easier way of canning most foods than the old open-kettle 
method, but also because the product retains much of its natural 
flavor and color and more of its nutritive value. 

Blanching for the Cold-Pack Method 

Blanching is a preliminary step sometimes used in the cold- 
pack method of canning. It is no longer considered necessary 
to blanch all vegetables, and whenever this step can be elimi- 
nated it saves time and a certain loss of food substance. To- 
miatoes and some fruits are blanched to make it easy to remove 
the skins. Blanching may be done with either boiling water or 
steam. 

Vegetables That Should be Blanched 

The following vegetables are the only ones which must be 
blanched before canning: 

Greens — ^All greens should be blanched about five minutes to re- 
duce the bulk. 

Corn — In order to prevent loss of the milk, corn should be 
blanched on the cob until it is firm to the touch and until the milk 
does not ooze out when the corn is pricked with a fork. 

Beets, Carrots, Parsnips — Beets, carrots and parsnips should be 
blanched until the skins will slip off easily. 

When Boiling Water is Used, place the fruit or the vege- 
tables in a piece of cheese-cloth or in a crate; lower this entirely 
under the water, and heat for the required number of minutes. 
Blanch only a small quantity of the product at a time in order 
to keep the water as near the boiling point as possible all during 
the process. 

For Blanching in Steam place the food in some perforated 
utensil or in a piece of cheese-cloth and suspend it in a tightly 
closed steamer. Greens should be blanched until no further 
shrinkage will occur. Blanching in steam generally requires a 
longer time than does blanching in boiling water. The steam 
must penetrate to all parts of the mass. For this reason do not 
crowd the fruits or vegetables, particularly when you are blanch- 
ing greens. 

The Cold Dip Which Follows Blanching rapidly chills 
the outside of the blanched fruit or vegetables and is accom- 
plished by plunging them into cold water. "While the food 
should be cooled sufficiently to make it easy to handle, do not 
allow it to remain in the cold water too long. 



66o 



Cooking or Processing in the Cold-Pack Method 

Food to be canned by the cold-pack method is usually heated 
or, as it is called, processed in one of two ways. 

1 — Continuous boiling in a hot-water bath (at 212° F.). 
a — For a long period of time. 

b — For a shorter period of time, if a small amount of lemon- 
juice or vinegar is used. 

2 — Cooking at a high temperature in steam under pressure. 

"While a continuous period of cooking in boiling water may be 
successful for vegetables and meats, if the period is long enough, 
it is not generally considered as effective in destroying the organ- 
isms that cause spoilage as cooking in steam under pressure. As 
a precaution against botulinus poisoning, vegetables canned in 
the hot-water bath should be boiled after being opened, before 
they are used. 

Acid as an Aid in Canning by the Cold-Pack Method 

If a steam pressure cooker is not available, the use of a food 
acid (lemon- juice or vinegar) with foods processed in a hot- 
water bath increases the certainty of success in canning corn, 
peas, beans, asparagus and greens. The acid flavor is scarcely 
noticeable and to most persons not objectionable. 

Quantity of Acid to Use — For each pint jar of vegetables, 
use one tablespoon of vinegar or lemon-juice and one teaspoon 
of salt. Boil the jars of vegetables in the hot- water bath for 
one and one-half hours, according to the directions given farther 
along in this chapter for each vegetable. 

General Directions for Canning Vegetables by the 
Cold-Pack Method 

1. Choose vegetables that are young and that have made a quick 
growth. 

2. Do not use very dirty vegetables as more micro-organisms are 
present on these than on clean vegetables. 

3. Do not attempt to handle too large a quantity of vegetables at 
once, especially in hot weather. The various steps in the canning 
process must be followed in rapid succession to prevent loss of flavor 
caused by what is known as flat sour, and large quantities can not be 
handled rapidly. 

4. Can vegetables as soon as possible after they have been picked. 
This is particularly necessary with asparagus, peas, beans and corn. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 66i 

5. Clean the vegetables thoroughly and prepare them as for cooking. 

6. If there is much variation in size, grade the vegetables so that 
the contents of each jar will be as nearly uniform as possible. 

7. Blanch the vegetables, if necessary (Page 659). The blanch- 
ing or scalding should be continued just long enough to make the 
vegetables sufficiently flexible to pack easily or to loosen the skins so 
that they can be quickly scraped off. Spinach and certain other deli- 
cately flavored greens should be blanched in steam instead of in boil- 
ing water, until they are thoroughly shrunken. 

8. Chill the outside of the vegetables by immersing them in a 
large receptacle of cold water and removing them immediately. Do 
not attempt to cool the vegetables thoroughly by this cold dip. 

9. Pack the vegetables in clean, tested jars to within one-half inch 
of the top. Corn should be packed only to within one inch of the 
top. Shake the jars to get a good pack, but do not press the vegetables 
down with a spoon. 

10. Add from one-half to one teaspoon of salt to each pint jar. 
Some vegetables, such as peas, corn, beets and pumpkin, are improved 
by the addition of a small amount of sugar as well. 

11. Fill the jars with boiling water to within one-fourth inch of 
the top. Place a new rubber on each jar, adjust the cover, and partly 
seal it by adjusting only the upper clamp or by slightly screwing the 
Hd. 

12-A. If the hot-water bath is used, place the jars on the rack in the 
container and add water. The boiling water should cover the tops 
of the jars to the depth of ~about one inch. 

In using the hot-water bath do not begin to time the heating until 
the water boils over the jars. Keep the water boiling during the entire 
period. (Time-table on page 665.) 

B. If the pressure cooker is used, place the cooker on the stove and 
put in the rack before placing the jars in the cooker. Add sufficient 
water to come up to the rack but not to cover it. Let the water get 
warm. Place the jars in the crate and lower it into the kettle. If 
two tiers of jars are to be put in the cooker, place a rack between 
them. Adjust the cover and place all the bolts in position; then be- 
gin screwing them down by hand, in rotation. Do not finish screw- 
ing down one bolt before starting the others. A better connection is 
obtained by following the right method. Finish tightening the nuts 
with a wrench. 

Open the pet-cock and allow it to stand until a fine stream of 
steam appears; then close it. Shortly after this, the pointer on the 
dial will begin to move or register pressure. As soon as the desired 
pressure is reached, lower the heat and keep the steam at that pressure 
for the required length of time. See table on page 664. 

When the required time is up, turn out the heat or remove the 
cooker from the fire. When the pointer on the dial of the cooker 



662 

registers zero, open the pet-cock gradually and allow the steam to 
escape. If the pet-cock is opened before the pressure is down to zero, 
the liquid escapes from the jars and there is danger of forcing out 
the rubbers. 

13. Remove the jars from the hot-water bath or cooker, seal them, 
and invert while they are cooling, so that if there is a leakage in the 
jar it may appear in time. Avoid a draft on the jars, but cool them 
as quickly as possible, especially if the vegetables are corn, beans, 
asparagus or greens. 

14. Wash the jars, label them, and store in a cool place. 

General Directions for Canning Fruit by the 
Cold-Pack Method 

1. Select firm, well-grown, but not overripe fruit. 

2. If possible, can fruit on the day that it is picked. 

3. Wash, pare, and prepare the fruit, removing all bruised or de- 
cayed parts. 

4. If there is much variation in size, sort the fruit so that the con- 
tents of each jar will be as nearly uniform as possible. 

5. Blanch the fruit if necessary in boiling water, a small quantity 
at a time, until the skin slips off. 

6. Chill the outside of the blanched fruit by immersing it for a 
brief period in a large receptacle of cold water. Do not attempt to 
cool the fruit thoroughly by this cold dip. 

7. Pack the fruit firnily in clean, tested jars to within one-half inch 
of the top. 

8. Fill the jars with boiling sirup or hot water. 

9. Place a new rubber on each jar, adjust the cover of the jar, and 
partly seal it by adjusting only the upper clamp or by slightly screw- 
ing the lid. "^ 

10. Cook for the required length of time in the hot-water bath, or, 
in the case of hard pears, or pineapple, in the pressure cooker. (See 
tables pages 664-665.) Be sure to have the jars completely immersed 
in water. 

General Directions for Canning Meat by the 
Cold-Pack Method 

Continuous heating is necessary in canning meats. Most 
authorities agree that meat should be canned only under steam- 
pressure. 

The various parts of beef, veal, pork and mutton may be 
canned successfully, as may chicken and rabbit. Rabbit is 
canned on the bone. 

1. Select meat in perfect condition. Tough cuts lend themselves 
well to canning. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 663 

2. Trim off dark-colored or strong-smelling portions and siirplus 
fat. If mutton is being canned, be careful to remove the thin outer 
skin, which has a strong flavor. Wipe the meat well with a damp 
cloth. The bones may be used for making soup stock. 

3. Free the meat from bones and cut it into pieces suitable for 
packing in the jars. 

4. Pack the raw meat solidly into clean glass jars, filling them to 
within one inch of the top. 

5. Add from one-half to one teaspoon of salt for each pint of meat, 
and other seasoning, such as chopped onion, celery leaves, or bay- 
leaf, if desired. Add no water. 

6. Adjust the rubbers and the covers, and partly seal the jar. 

7. Heat the jars under ten pounds of pressure for one and three- 
quarters hours. If a water-bath is used, boil for five hours. 

Avoid These Mistakes in Canning Any Food 

If there is an empty space in the jar it may be caused by any 
one of these conditions: 

1. The jar may have been packed too loosely. 

2. The product may not have been blanched enough to cause 
necessary shrinkage. 

3. The pressure may have fluctuated instead of being kept steady. 

4. The pet-cock of the pressure cooker may have opened before 
the pressure dropped to zero. 

To be sure, the empty space will not affect the quality of 
the food, but it does detract from the appearance and wastes 
space. 

Lack of liquid in the jar may also be caused by uneven 
temperature, and when the jar is packed closely there is little 
space left when the water is added. The product will keep 
in this condition, but the flavor seems to be better if the food 
is practically covered with liquid. 

In the canning of greens, asparagus, peas, beans and corn, 
flat sour seems to be responsible for more failures than any 
other one factor. 

This condition is not always apparent until the jar is opened. 
The appearance may be unchanged as to color and texture, but 
when the jar is opened the taste and odor are bad and the prod- 
uct must be destroyed. Occasionally neither odor nor taste is 
detected until the food is heated. Sometimes the presence of 
flat sour is indicated by the slightly clouded color of the liquid 
and a general change in the color of the product itself. 

This condition seems to develop at different stages along the 



664 

route from the garden to the canner. It is imperative then to 
use only fresh sound vegetables, since changes are said to take 
place in vegetables when they are allowed to stand for a time 
in a warm place. Hence it is also necessary to prepare only a 
limited number of jars at one time, so that the product can be 
handled rapidly. 

Caution in Using Home-Canned Foods 

Because of possible danger from botulinus poisoning, it may 
be well to boil all home-canned vegetables for five minutes after 
the can is opened. This should be done even if the food is to be 
served cold in a salad. 

1. When the cover is loosened, if there is an escape of air or liquid, 
it may indicate that gas has been formed by the spoiling of the food. 

2. Smell the contents, but do not taste. A peculiar odor indicates 
spoiled food, and a single taste of food spoiled by botulinus is some- 
times fatal. 

3. The liquid should be clear, free from all clouded appearance. 

4. The food should be firm and free from mold. 

5. Do not take any chances. If there is any doubt as to the con- 
dition of the food discard it. 

6. I£ the food is in good condition, do not pour off the liquid. 
Vegetable juices contain minerals and other valuable food substances 
and may be added to soups, gravies and sauces.

SIRUPS FOR CANNING FRUITS 

The thickness of sirup for canning fruits depends upon the 
kind of fruit with which it is to be used and upon the richness 
of the product desired. 



666 



In order to obtain the grades of sirup ordinarily used in 
canning, sugar and water may be combined in the following 
proportions and boiled five minutes. The quantity of water 
is given as the same in each grade in order to show the variation 
in the quantity of sugar used: 

Thin Sirup — ^Four cups of water, two cups of sugar. This sirup 
may be used for such fruits as apples, pears, raspberries and other 
sweet berries, when a rich product is not desired. 

Medium Sirup — ^Four cups of water, two and one-half cups of 
sugar. This sirup may be used for such fruits as sweet plums, black- 
berries, and sweet cherries. 

Thick Sirup — ^Four cups of water, five cups of sugar. This sirup 
may be used for such fruits as peaches, cherries or pineapples, when 
a sweet product is desired. 

A still thicker sirup may be desired for rhubarb, gooseberries, 
currants, sour cherries, and other very sour fruits. Such a sirup may 
be made by boiling the thick sirup until it begins to spin a thread.

PRESERVES, MARMALADES, JAMS, CON- 
SERVES AND FRUIT BUTTERS 

In making preserves, marmalades, conserves, jams and fruit 
butters, a larger amount of sugar is used than in canning. 
The sugar is cooked into the fruit or condensed with the 
fruit-juice and acts as a natural preservative against yeasts and 
bacteria. These foods must still be protected from molds, and 
this is most satisfactorily accomplished by sealing in clean hot 
jars. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 667 



Preserves 

Preserves are fniits in which the tissues of the fruit have 
absorbed a heavy sugar sirup until they are filled with sirup 
instfead of with water. A good preserved fruit is plump and 
tender in texture and filled with sweetness. It is bright in 
color, clear and sparkling. 

Cook Hard Fruits Before Placing in Sirup — Stew hard 
fruits, such as hard pears, underripe peaches, pineapples, sweet 
apples, quinces, watermelon-rind or citron, until tender before 
placing them in a heavy sirup. This makes the fruit soft, so 
that the sirup can enter the cells of the fruit. If these fruits 
are not treated in this way, the preserves will be hard and tough 
instead of plump and tender. Tender fruits such as berries, 
ripe peaches or cherries may be placed at once in a heavy sirup. 

Cook Rapidly in Sirup — Cook the fruit rapidly in the sirup, 
and only long enough for the sirup to fill the fruit. Too long 
cooking gives a dark, stiflf product. 

When foods have been given a preliminary cooking to make 
them tender, drain them before adding them to the sirup. The 
water in which they were cooked should be used for making 
the sirup. Place the fruit in the sirup and bring it quickly to 
the boiling-point; continue the cooking rapidly until the prod- 
uct has a bright, clear, shiny look, showing that the fruit is 
filled with the clear sirup. 

Plumping — If an extra fine quality of preserve is desired, 
add the fruit to the sirup and heat it only until it bubbles ; then 
set it away in a covered enamel preserving-kettle for several 
hours, or over night. Then continue the cooking. In this way, 
more sirup is absorbed by the fruit. If the amount of extra 
work entailed is not too exacting, the heating and cooling 
process may be repeated several times. Pears, peaches, green 
tomatoes, whole tomatoes, crabapples, citron and melon-rind 
are especially adapted to plumping. Fruit to be candied should 
be plumped. 

Sealing — ^The best method of keeping preserves is to seal 
them in hot clean jars. If trouble has been experienced with 
molds, it may be desirable to hold the jars of preserves in steam 
or boiling water for ten minutes as an extra precaution against 
molds. All jars, rubbers, spoons and utensils that are to be 
used in placing preserves in the jars should be sterilized in boil- 
ing water. 



668 



SIRUP FOR PRESERVES 

The amount of sugar used in making the sirup for preserves 
may vary with the tastes of the individual. About three- 
fourths pound of sugar and three-fourths cup of water to "one 
pound of fruit is used for most fruits. For gooseberries and 
very tart fruits, a pound to pound proportion of sugar is re- 
quired. Dissolve the sugar in the water and boil the sirup for 
five or ten minutes, according to the sweetness desired. If a 
very rich preserve is to be made, boil sirup until it spins a thread 
(230° F.), before adding the fruit. 

BERRY PRESERVES 

Follow recipe for strawberry preserves or sun -cooked pre- 
serves (pp. 671-672) for all berries except blackberries. Black- 
berries do not make satisfactory preserves, on account of the 
large hard seeds. 

CHERRY PRESERVES 
2 pounds sour cherries, lYz pounds sugar 

weighed after stoning 

Add the sugar to the stoned cherries and bring them quickly 
to the boiling-point. Cook rapidly until the fruit is clear, 
skimming as necessary. Pour at once into clean hot jars and 
seal. 

FIG PRESERVES 

4 pounds fresh figs 1 cup water 

2 pounds sugar 1 lemon 

"Wash and peel the figs. Slice the lemon. Boil the sugar and 
water together for ten minutes, then add the figs and lemon. 
Cook rapidly until the fruit is clear. Seal in clean hot jars. 

PRESERVED GINGER 

1 pound fresh ginger roots 1 Yz cups water 1 pound sugar 

Scrub roots of fresh green ginger thoroughly, using a brush. 
Pare with a very sharp knife, and place the roots at once in 
cold water. Rinse well and place in fresh cold water. Let stand 
over night. Drain, weigh the ginger, place it in a preserving- 
kettle, and cover it with cold water. When the water is boil- 
ing, skim out the ginger and place it again in cold water. When 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 669 

quite cool, return to the kettle, add more cold water, and when 
the water is boiling, skim out the ginger and lay in cold water, 
as before. Do this three times, or until the ginger is tender. 

Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes. Drain 
the ginger and add it to the sirup. Bring quickly to the boil- 
ing-point; remove from the heat and let it stand over night. 
Drain off the sirup, let it come to a boil and repeat the first 
process. 

Drain off the sirup again, heat to boiling, add the ginger and 
simmer until clear. Pour into clean hot jars and seal. It will 
be ready to use in two weeks. 

GOOSEBERRY PRESERVES 

1 pound green gooseberries 1J4 pounds sugar 

Stem the berries, remove the blossom end, and wash the fruit 
in cold water. Half cover the gooseberries with water and scald 
the fruit until the skins are soft. Add the sugar to the hot 
mixture. Bring quickly to the boiling-point and cook until 
clear. Seal at once in clean hot jars.

"Wash the grapes and press the pulp from the skins. (They 
are extra nice if seeded.) Boil the sugar and water ten min- 
utes. Add the fruit and cook until the grapes are clear and the 
sirup is thick. Pour into hot clean jars and seal. 

GREEN-GAGE PRESERVES 

% pound sugar to each pound of fruit 

Place the plums in a wire basket, immerse the basket in boil- 
ing water, and when the skins crack and loosen remove the 
plums from the water and peel them. Place a layer of the 
fruit in a large earthen jar, sprinkle it with some of the sugar, 
add another layer of fruit, and one of sugar, and when all is 
used set the jar aside until the next morning. In the morning, 
draw off the juice that has formed. Boil it for ten minutes, 
skimming it as the scum rises. Add the fruit, and cook rapidly 



670 

until the plums are clear and tender. Skim out the fruit, place 
on a large platter, and boil the sirup until it coats a spoon, 
draining into the kettle all that drains from the fruit on the 
platter. When thick enough, return the fruit to the sirup and 
bring to a boil. Pour into clean hot jars and seal. 

PEACH PRESERVES 

y^ pound sugar and % cup of water to each pound of prepared 

fruit 

Cling-stone peaches are better than free-stone, for they keep 
their shape better. Wash, peel, and remove the stones if de- 
sired. If the stones are to be removed, cut the peaches in 
quarters. Boil the sugar and water for ten minutes. Skim, add 
the fruit and cook rapidly until it is transparent. Seal in clean 
hot jars. 

PINEAPPLE PRESERVES 

% pound sugar to each pound of prepared fruit 

Pare the pineapple, and with a sharp, pointed knife extract 
the eyes; then with a silver fork tear the fruit off the core in 
pieces of moderate size. Weigh the pulp, then place it in a 
preserving-kettle and partly cover it with water. Cover the 
kettle closely. Cook until the pineapple is tender. Then drain 
the pineapple from the water and add the sugar to the water, 
and cook together until the sirup is thick enough to coat a 
spoon. Return the fruit to the sirup and cook rapidly until 
clear. Pour into clean hot jars and seal. 

PLUM PRESERVES 

6 pounds fruit 4 Yz pounds sugar 1 cup water 

Select small purple plums and be sure they are sound and not 
overripe. Remove the stems, wash the fruit, and pierce each 
plum with a fork. Place the plums in an earthen bowl or jar, 
cover them with the sugar and add the water. Cover the bowl 
and set in a cool place over night. Drain the plums, and boil 
the juice for five minutes. Add the plums and cook until clear. 
This will take only a few minutes, and care should be taken 
not to overcook, as the sirup thickens or jellies after standing. 
Pour into hot, clean jars and seal. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 671 

QUINCE PRESERVES 

3 quarts sugar 3 cups water 4 quarts prepared fruit 

Never cook quinces in sirup before steaming or boiling them 
in water until tender, as sugar hardens the uncooked fruit. 

Scrub the quinces with a stiff brush, wash, pare, core, and 
quarter, dropping the pieces into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloration. Save all the good parings and cores for jelly. 
Measure the prepared fruit, put it into a preserving-kettle, 
cover with cold water and cook until the fruit is soft, then 
skim out and drain. Save the water to be used with the par- 
ings, cores, and gnarly fruit for jelly. 

Make a sirup of the sugar and water and boil for £.Ye minutes. 
Add the drained quince quarters and cook rapidly until the 
fruit is clear. Pour into clean, hot glasses and seal. 

Many persons prefer quince preserves made with an equal 
measure of sweet apples or firm pears. The method of making 
is the same as for quinces alone. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES 

4 pounds berries 3 pounds sugar 

Pick over, wash, and hull the berries. Add the sugar to the 
strawberries, and heat gently until the sugar dissolves and the 
juice is drawn from the beiyries. Cook rapidly until the fruit 
is plump and transparent and the sirup thick. Pack carefully 
in clean, hot jars and seal. All berries except blackberries may 
be made into preserves by this method. (See also Sun Cooked 
Preserves below.) 

EIGHT-MINUTE STRAWBERRY PRESERVES 

Select large firm berries of deep-red color. Wash and remove 
the hulls. Weigh the berries and add an equal weight of sugar. 
Mix the berries with the sugar, using a wooden spoon and lift- 
ing the berries gently to avoid crushing them. Place the berries 
and sugar at once over the fire. Bring them to the boiling- 
point as soon as possible and boil rapidly for eight minutes. 
Seal in clean hot jars. By this method the berries keep their 
shape and the finished product has a clear, rich color. 



672 



SUN-COOKED PRESERVES 

Small fruits like strawberries, raspberries, and currants can 
be preserved by this process. Wash the fruit, drain thoroughly, 
pick over and stem, then weigh it. For each pound of fruit, 
allow one pound of sugar and one cup of water. Add the water 
to the sugar and cook until the sirup spins a thread. Remove 
the sirup from the fire. Add the fruit and let it remain in the 
sirup over night. With a skimmer remove the fruit from the 
sirup, and lay it on platters or flat dishes. Cook the sirup again 
imtil it threads. Pour the hot sirup over the berries, cover the 
platter with cheese-cloth or glass and place in the direct sun- 
light. A glass cover hastens the process. Allow the fruit to 
stand three or four days in the sunshine, or until the sirup is 
thick and jelly-like in consistency. Pack in clean jars and seal. 

TOMATO PRESERVES 

1 pound small, yellow 1 lemon 

tomatoes % pound sugar 

Select the small yellow tomatoes that are about the size of 
small plums. Pour boiling water over them and cover tightly 
for two minutes, then quickly drain and cover with cold water. 
This will loosen the skins. Peel the tomatoes, being careful not 
to break them. If any are found with the skins still un- 
loosened, treat them again with bofling water. Place the sugar 
and tomatoes in a crock or enamel bowl and let stand over 
night. Drain off the juice and boil rapidly until it threads. 
Add the tomatoes and the thinly sliced lemon. Cook until clear 
and thick. Seal in clean hot jars. 

GREEN TOMATO PRESERVES 

8 pounds green tomatoes 1 tablespoon preserved ginger 

6 pounds sugar 6 lemons 

"Wash the tomatoes, remove any dark parts about the stems, 
and weigh them. Cover them with boiling water, let them 
stand five minutes, drain and slice them into a preserving-kettle, 
placing a layer of the tomatoes, then a layer of sliced lemon, 
then the sugar with the ginger sprinkled over it. Let the mix- 
ture stand over night. Drain and boil the sirup for ten minutes. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 673 

Skim, add the tomatoes and cook rapidly until they are clear. 
Pour into clean, hot jars and seal. 

Jams 

Jam is made from whole small fruits which are either mashed 
or cooked to a pulp with sugar. Good jam is soft, tender and 
jelly-like in texture, bright and sparkling in color and of the 
same consistency throughout the mixture. 

Some Underripe Fruit Desirable — ^Portions of fruit left 
from canning, or broken fruit, may be used for jam, but at 
least a portion of the fruit should be underripe. Overripe fruit 
lacks pectin and some pectin, a jellying substance, is necessary 
for good jam. 

Cook the Fruit Before Adding Sugar — ^In order to de- 
velop the pectin substance, the fruit should be cooked for a few 
minutes before the sugar is added. If the fruit does not have 
sufl&cient juice, add just enough water to keep it from burning 
and cook it in a covered kettle. 

Not too Much Sugar — ^The best jam is made by using not 
more than three-fourths pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Cook Quickly and Not too Long — ^After the sugar is 
added to the fruit, continue the cooking quickly until the jam 
gives a jelly-like appearance. It should hang in sheets from the 
spoon or set quickly if a portion is dropped on a cool plate. It 
should be tender and jelly-like, not thick and tough. Jam 
thickens on cooling, and an allowance must be made for this 
or the jam will be overcooked. Overcooking also darkens the 
product. It is better to make a small amount of jam at a time. 
Use enamel or porcelain cooking utensils, if possible. 

Stir to Prevent Burning — ^Jam is a highly concentrated 
mass and will burn quickly unless it is stirred from the bottom. 
Use a wooden spoon and lift the mass from the bottom. It is 
better to cook jam briskly and watch it carefully for twenty 
or thirty minutes than to let it simmer for hours. 

Seal in Hot, Clean Jars — Jams, like preserves, are safer 
from molds if they are sealed in hot, clean jars. 

BLACKBERRY JAM 

Mash the berries, cook them in their own juice until they are 
thoroughly heated, then press them through a sieve to remove 



674 

the seeds, which are objectionably large. Measure this pulp 
and liquid, and for every pint allow one cup of sugar. Add 
the sugar to the pulp, and cook rapidly until thick, stirring 
frequently. Pack in clean, hot jars and seal. 

FIG JAM 

154 cups sugar to 1 pint of stewed figs 

Select soft, ripe, white figs, remove the stems and peel. 
Mash, add just enough water to prevent scorching and cook 
until they are soft. Add sugar and cook rapidly until the mix- 
ture is thick and amber colored with a shiny surface. 

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT JAM 

1 pound red raspberries 54 cup currant-juice % pound sugar 

Mash the fruit, add the currant- juice, and bring to the boil- 
ing-point, stirring well from the bottom. Add the sugar and 
cook until thick, stirring occasionally. Pack in clean hot jars 
and seal. 

STRAWBERRY JAM 

% pound sugar to 1 pound hulled berries 

Pick over the berries and remove the hulls. Put the fruit on 
the fire alone, mashing it as it heats; a wooden potato-masher 
is best for the purpose. Bring the fruit to a boil, stirring al- 
most constantly and crushing any berries that may remain 
whole. Add the sugar to the fruit and boil together until thick 
(not over twenty minutes), stirring well to prevent burning. 
Pack in clean hot jars and seal. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM 

Follow directions for strawberry jam, but boil the fruit alone 
until the skins are soft, then add the sugar and boil until the 
mixture is thick. Avoid too long cooking, as the juice will 
thicken on standing. 

GRAPE JAM 

Stem the grapes, wash, and press the pulp from the skins. 
Place the pulp in a kettle, cook until soft, then rub through a 
sieve to remove the seeds. Cook the skins until soft in just 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 675 

enough water to cover. Combine the two mixtures and boil for 
five minutes. Measure and allow one cup of sugar to every pint 
of fruit. Cook until thick, which will take but a few minutes. 
Pack in clean hot jars and seal. 

PEACH JAM 

5 pounds peaches 1 cup water 3 pounds sugar 

Choose good peaches that are not firm enough for canning. 
Remove the stones and cut in slices. Put the water in the pre- 
serving-kettle and add the peaches. Cover and cook until soft, 
stirring to prevent sticking. Add the sugar and cook until 
thick and jelly-like. Pack in clean, hot jars and seal. 

RED RASPBERRY JAM 

Pick over the berries and wash them carefully. "Weigh, and 
to each pound of fruit allow three- fourths pound of sugar. 
Heat the berries gently in a preserving-kettle. When the juice 
starts, mash with a wooden potato-masher. Add the sugar and 
cook rapidly until thick and clear. Seal in clean hot jars. 

Marmalades 

Marmalades are usually made from fruits which have some 
jelly-making properties, that is, in which both pectin and acid 
are present. Thin slices of fruit are used and the product shows 
a clear jelly or jelly-like sirup in which the sliced or cut fruit 
is suspended. If a fruit is used which lacks these jellying prop- 
erties, they are often supplied by adding sliced orange or lemon 
or by using some tart apple- juice. 

Marmalades are prepared in the same way as jams, except that 
the fruit remains in thin slices or cut portions and is not mashed. 
They should be clear and sparkling in color. 

ORANGE MARMALADE 

12 thin-skinned oranges 3 lemons 

"Wash the fruit and slice it as thin as paper, or grind it fine. 
For each quart of fruit, add one and one-half quarts of water 
and let the mixture stand over night. In the morning cook it 
slowly until tender, from two to two and one-half hours. 



676 

Measure the cooked fruit and add an equal amount of sugar. 
Cook the mixture until it jellies from a spoon (thirty to sixty- 
minutes) . Pour it into clean, hot jars and when it is cold, cover 
it with hot paraffin. 

CARROT AND ORANGE MARMALADE 

6 carrots 1 lemon 

3 oranges Sugar 

Dice the carrots and cook them until they are tender, in as 
little water as possible. Slice the oranges in thin pieces and 
add the juice and grated rind of the lemon. Measure the carrot 
and fruit, and add two-thirds as much sugar. Simmer the mix- 
ture until it is clear. Turn it into jelly glasses, and when it is 
cold, cover it with hot paraffin. 

AMBER MARMALADE 

1 grapefruit 3 Yz quarts water 

1 orange 5 pounds sugar 

1 lemon 

Wash and wipe the fruit. Cut in paper-thin slices, using a 
very sharp knife. Add the water and let stand over night. 
Cook until the peel is tender and let it stand over night. Add 
the sugar and cook until the sirup thickens slightly on a cold 
dish. Pour into clean jars and seal. 

GRAPEFRUIT MARMALADE 

1 pound peeled grapefruit %. pound sugar 

1 quart water ^ poimd grapefruit peel 

Wash the fruit and remove the peel in uniform sections. 
Choose one- fourth pound of peel that is free from blemishes 
and cut it into thin slices. Cover with water, and boil for ten 
minutes. Drain, cover with boiling water, and repeat the 
process four or five times to remove the bitter flavor. 

Weigh the pulp and slice it. Cover with the water and boil 
until very tender. Pour into a flannel jelly-bag, press until no 
more juice can be obtained, and filter the juice through another 
clean flannel jelly-bag without pressing. Pour the juice into 
the kettle, add the sliced peel, and the sugar, and boil rapidly 
imtil it reaches the jellying point.

sugar as pulp. Cook until it is thick and clear (about twenty- 
five minutes). Turn it into clean, hot glasses and when it is 
cold cover it with hot paraffin. 

RHUBARB MARMALADE 

Rhubarb for marmalade should be young and fresh. Cut it 
into inch lengths without peeling. Weigh it. Allow three- 
fourths pound of sugar to every pound of rhubarb. Place the 
sugar and rhubarb in a preserving-kettle, heat it very slowly 
and boil until thick and clear. Pack in clean hot jars and seal. 

Conserves 

Conserves, like marmalades, may be made of large or small 
fruits. They differ from marmalade in that several fruits may 
be combined and nuts may be added. In this way, it is possible 
to develop pleasing combinations of flavors and to combine 
fruits which have good acid or pectin content with fruits that 
lack these qualities. Conserves are made in the same way as 
marmalades. When nuts are used, they are added after all the 
cooking is done, as heat toughens the nut-meats. 

CHERRY CONSERVE 

3 pints pitted sour cherries 2% cups sugar 

1 pint black raspberries 

Combine all the ingredients, and cook until thick and clear. 

No. 1. CRANBERRY CONSERVE 

1 quart cranberries 2% cups sugar 

1 cup water J4 pound walnut-meats 

Juice of 1 orange 

Wash the cranberries and cook them in the water until the 
berries burst. Add all the remaining ingredients except the 
nuts and cook until the mixture is thick. Break the nuts into

small pieces, add them to the cooked mixture, then pour it into 
hot, clean glasses and seal. 

No. 2. 

2 quarts cranberries 2 lemons 

1 cup raisins 6 cups sugar 

2 oranges 

Combine the grated rind and juice of the oranges and lemons 
with the other ingredients and cook until the mixture is thick 
and clear. Pour into hot, clean glasses and seal. This is an 
excellent relish with game. 



CURRANT CONSERVE

6 5^ cups sugar 1 cup walnut-meats 

Combine the grated rind and juice of the oranges with the 
currants and sugar and cook until the mixture is thick and clear. 
Add the nuts, pour into clean, hot glasses and seal. 



GRAPE CONSERVE 

2 pints grapes lYi cups sugar 

2 oranges 1 cup walnut-meats 

1 cup seeded raisins 

"Wash, stem, and seed the grapes. Slice the oranges very thin, 
and add to the grapes. Add the raisins and sugar and cook 
until the mixture is transparent and thick. Add the chopped 
walnut-meats. Pack while hot in hot, clean jars and seal. 



PINEAPPLE CONSERVE 

1 quart pineapple pulp and 1 lemon 
juice 3 cups sugar 

2 oranges 

Pare the pineapples and put them through the food-chopper. 
Steam until tender. Add the sugar, grated rind and pulp of 
the oranges and lemons and cook the mixture rapidly until it 
is thick. Pour into glasses and seal. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 679 



PINEAPPLE AND RHUBARB CONSERVE 

1 quart shredded pineapple 3 J4 quarts sugar 
4 quarts rhubarb 1 cup nut-meats 

2 oranges 

Cook the pineapple in a covered kettle, with a small amount 
of water, until tender. Add the rhubarb, juice and grated rind 
of the oranges, and the sugar, and cook until thick. Add the 
chopped nuts and seal in clean, hot jars. This makes an ex- 
cellent filling for sandwiches. 

PLUM CONSERVE 

2 quarts plums 5J4 cups sugar 1 lemon 

"Wash and pit the plums. Add a small amount of water and 
cook in a covered kettle until the skins are soft. Add the 
sugar, and grated rind and juice of the lemon, and cook until 
the mixture is thick and clear. Pack into hot, clean glasses and 
seal. 

Fruit Butters 

Fruit butters are among the most wholesome of fruit sweets, 
as they contain a large^^mount of fruit to a small amount of 
sugar. In making butters, the whole fruit is cooked until 
tender and then rubbed through a sieve. Sugar is added, and 
spice if desired, and the mixture is cooked until it is smooth 
and thick. Like jam, it must be carefully watched and should 
not be overcooked. 

GRAPE BUTTER 

4 pounds grapes 1 pound sugar 

"Wash and stem the grapes. Cook in a small amount of 
water until the skins are soft. Press the pulp through a strainer, 
to remove seeds and skins. Add the sugar and cook until thick 
and clear. Pour into hot, clean glasses and seal. 

PEACH BUTTER 

2 quarts peach pulp 4 cups sugar 1 cup water 

Pare, stone, slice and measure the fruit. Place it in the pre- 
serving-kettle with the water and heat it very slowly. When 



68o 

it is soft, pass the peaches through a fine sieve, return the pulp 
to the fire, add the sugar, and cook until thick and clear. Pack 
in hot, clean jars and seal. 



APPLE BUTTER 

Wash the apples, and cut them in eighths. Cook them in a 
small amount of water until they are tender. Put them through 
a sieve. To each cup of pulp add four tablespoons of sugar 
and cook the mixture until it is thick. If the apples lack flavor, 
a small amount of lemon- juice and grated rind may be added. 
Pour into hot, clean glasses and seal. 



APPLE AND PLUM BUTTER 

Wash and cut the apples and the plums. Use about three 
times as many apples as plums. Cook them in a small amount 
of water until they are tender, then put the cooked fruit 
through a sieve. To each cup of fruit pulp, add one-third cup 
of sugar. Cook the butter until it is thick and clear. Pour 
into hot, clean glasses and seal.

CANDIED FRUITS AND FRUIT PASTES 

See chapter on Candies, pages 514-516. 

FRUIT JELLIES 

Fruit-jelly is made by combining fruit-juices and sugar in the 
right proportions and under the right conditions. To be good 
for jelly, a fruit-juice must contain acid and a substance called 
pectin. Pectin is the essential jelly-making substance. Some 
fruits contain acid and pectin in proper proportions for mak- 
ing perfect jelly. With other fruit- juices either acid or pectin 
has to be supplied by some other fruit in order to make good 
jelly. A sour juice makes a more tender jelly than one that 
contains little acid. Without sufficient pectin the mass will not 
jelly. 

The Best Fruits for Jelly Making 

Among the fruit- juices that make good jelly when used alone 
are apple, crabapple, partly ripe grapes, currants, and slightly 
underripe red raspberries. Such fruits as strawberries, peaches, 
pears, pineapples and cherries do not make good jelly when used 
alone. Currant-juice may be used with an equal measure of rhu- 
barb-juice, with good r-esults in color, texture and flavor. The 
table on page 683 suggests good combinations of fruit- juices. 

A perfect jelly is clear, bright and tender. When cut, it has 
a clean surface and does not stick to the knife or spoon. When 
turned from the glass, jelly should hold its shape and should 
quiver but not break. 

How to Make Jelly 
METHOD I 

Look the fruit over carefully, and remove blossom ends or 
decayed parts. It is generally not necessary to remove the skins. 
Most fruits need to be cooked before the juice can be extracted. 
Juicy fruits should be cooked in a small amount of water. Such 
fruits as apples should be covered with water. 

First Extraction of Juice — Cook the fruit until it is 
tender, turn it into a jelly-bag and allow the juice to dnp 
through. If a clear jelly is desired, do not squeeze the bag. 
Squeezing gives a cloudy jelly. 



682 

Second and Third Extractions — ^A second and a third ex- 
traction may be made from such fruits as crabapples, apples, 
grapes, currants and quinces. Return the pulp to the preserv- 
ing-kettle after the juice has dripped from it, cover it with 
water, heat it gradually and allow it to simmer for thirty min- 
utes. At the end of that time, turn it into a jelly-bag and allow 
it to drip without squeezing. This juice is usually kept separate 
from the first extraction and made into jelly by itself. It has 
good taste but is not clear. 

Tests for Pectin 

In making jelly, it is necessary to know in general the pro- 
portion of pectin present, as on this depends not only the 
jellying of the mass but also the amount of sugar that will be 
required. 

Epsom-Salts Test for Pectin — ^To one tablespoon of 
cooked fruit-juice, add one teaspoon sugar and one-half table- 
spoon Epsom salts. Stir the mixture until the salts have dis- 
solved, and let it stand for twenty minutes. If the mixture 
forms a solid mass or large flocculent particles, the juice will 
make a satisfactory jelly without added pectin. 

Quantity of Sugar 

Probably many of the failures in jelly-making are caused by 
the addition of too much sugar. Currants, underripe grapes, 
green gooseberries, barberries, and wild apples are practically 
the only fruit-juices that require an equal measure of sugar. 
Two- thirds as much sugar as juice is a good proportion for 
most fruits; the table on next page gives the proportions of 
juices and sugar for different kinds of jelly. 

FESTIVE FLAVORS 

Apple and crab apple jelly take on a note of gaiety if flavored 
with a spray of the leaves of rose geranium, lemon verbena or 
fresh mint. Drop the sprigs into the boiling jelly just before 
it is finished and allow to cool with the jelly while pouring. The 
jelly glass can also be decorated by enclosing a flower. Use a 
wild rose or other simple flower. "Wash, and with the petals 
damp press it to the bottom of the glass. Add a spoonful of the 
jelly, partly cool and allow it to solidify before filling the re- 
mainder of the glass.

Cooking the Jelly 

In general, not more than two quarts of jelly should be 
cooked at one time. The capacity of the preserving-kettle 
should be four or five times as great as the amount of juice to 
be cooked, as there is a tendency for the juice to boil over.

684 

Measure the juice and boil it rapidly for £^ve minutes, skim- 
ming it if necessary. Add the sugar and stir the juice until the 
sugar is dissolved. Heating the sugar seems to save no time, 
nor does it seem to improve the quality of the jelly. Cook the 
juice very rapidly, to obtain a bright, clear product; long, slow 
cooking gives a dull, dark jelly of inferior texture. 

Jelly Test — ^To test the jelly, take up a small amount of 
the juice in a spoon and allow it to drop from the side of the 
spoon. When the drops flow together and sheet from the 
spoon, the jelly is done and should be removed from the heat 
at once. 

Sealing the Jelly 

Pour the hot juice into clean, hot glasses, filling them to the 
top. The jelly shrinks as it cools and leaves a space for the 
paraffin. When the jelly is cold and has set, cover it with hot 
paraffin. 

When Fruits Lack Sufficient Pectin 

"When a fruit- juice, or a combination of fruit- juices, does not 
contain enough pectin to make jelly, a concentrated form of 
ready-to-use pectin may be used. (See Method II.) 

METHOD II 

The ready-to-use pectins are very helpful in making jelly. 
It does not matter if the fruit is low in natural pectin, the pectin 
extract will jelly any fruit with which it is used. Hence, many 
fruits such as cherry, raspberry, peach, etc., which do not make 
a good jelly alone, can be used with concentrated pectin. This 
assurance of success recommands it to the woman who has never 
been a highly successful jelly-maker. Others prefer to use it 
because it is always ready; and also because the pectin extract 
has been subjected to much heat in preparation and is very 
concentrated, so that it is neither necessary nor wise to heat 
the fruit more than the few moments the directions advise. 
Unfortunately sometimes more heat is used than directed and 
consequently the pectin breaks down and the jelly is unsuc- 
cessful. Much the same thing happens when jelly made by the 
usual method is overcooked. 

Since jellies or jams made with ready-to-use pectins reqxxire 
little cooking, there is little loss from evaporation and so larger 
quantities are obtained than when the natural pectin of the 
fruit is depended upon. 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND JELLY MAKING 685 

Several types of combined fruit- juices and pectin are now 
on the market for use in making quick jellies. 

Directions for Using Concentrated Pectin 

Ready-to-use pectins are highly concentrated. The direc- 
tions given with the package should be carefully followed as 
these have been developed to give the most satisfactory results 
with the product. The proportions for their use are generally 
recommended as follows: 

For Strawberry, Blackberry, Raspberry or Loganberry 
Jelly use 4 cups of fruit juice, 8 cups of sugar and 1 cup of pectin. 

For Cherry, Peach or Pineapple Jelly use 3 cups juice, 6][/2 
cups sugar, and 1 cup pectin. 

For Elderberry Jelly use 3 Y^ cups juice, 8 cups sugar and 1 
cup pectin. 

To make these jellies, follow directions for extracting juice 
given under Method I, add the necessary amount of sugar to 
the juice, stir and bring the mixture to the boiling-point, add 
the pectin and boil vigorously for one minute. Remove the 
jelly from the heat, skim and pour it into hot glasses. 

Special Recipes for Making Jelly 

The directions for making jelly given on the previous pages 
may be used in making all jellies. Special directions are given 
for a few jellies of unusual characteristics. 

In Using Commercial Ready-to-Use Pectin for making 
jellies, follow the directions on the package or those supplied 
by the manufacturer, as these have been developed to give 
satisfactory results. 

BARBERRY JELLY 

Gather the berries just before the first frost. Remove the 
stems, wash and measure the berries, and to every two quarts 
allow one pint of water. Cook until the berries are soft, take 
from the fire, drain, and measure the juice. To each cup of 
juice allow one cup of sugar, for barberries require more sugar 
than most fruits. Boil the juice for five minutes, add the 
sugar and cook until it meets the jelly test; then turn into hot, 
clean glasses. When cool cover with paraffin. 



686 



LOQUAT JELLY 

"Wash the loquats carefully, remove the blossom end, and 
cut the fruit in half. Put the fruit in a preserving-kettle and 
add water to cover. Cook gently till the loquats are tender. 
Strain and measure the juice. Bring to the boiling-point, boil 
five minutes, and add three-fourths of a cup of sugar for each 
cup of juice. Boil until the jelly point is reached, strain, and 
pour into hot clean glasses. When cool, cover with hot 
parafl&n. 

MINT JELLY 

Wash the mint and chop it fine. To each cup of chopped 
mint add one-fourth cup sugar and one-fourth cup water and 
let it stand over night or for several hours. Place it over the 
heat and bring it to the boiling-point. 

Make apple jelly, using two-thirds cup sugar to each cup of 
apple-juice. When the jelly test is observed, add green vegetable 
coloring and one or two tablespoons of the prepared mint for 
each quart of apple-juice. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Quinces require long cooking to become tender. They may 
be cooked in the fireless cooker or under steam pressure ; in both 
cases they acquire a rich, dark red color. Quinces have too little 
acid and too much pectin to make a desirable jelly when the 
juice is used alone. An equal amount or twice as much tart 
apple improves the flavor. Equal parts of cranberry, quince, 
and apple-juice give a jelly of rich red color and delicious flavor. 

Cut the quinces in small pieces, add sufficient water to float 
them and cook them until they are tender. Drain off the juice. 
Use two-thirds as much sugar as fruit-juice. Proceed according 
to the directions for making jelly. The pulp may be used for 
conserve or butter. 

ROSELLE JELLY 

2 cups roselle-juice lYz cups sugar 2 teaspons lemon-juice 

Wash roselles, cover them with water and cook until they 
are tender. Strain, measure the juice, boil it for five minutes, 
and add sugar and lemon-juice in the proportion given above. 
Cook until it sheets from the spoon. Skim, and pour into hot, 
clean glasses. When cool, cover with paraffin. 



PICKLES AND RELISHES 



WHEN foods are preserved with salt water or vinegar, the 
process is called pickling. Sweet pickles, sour pickles, 
and spiced pickles, either sweet or sour, are secured by varying 
the spices and seasoning. 

Both fruits and vegetables may be pickled whole, or in halves, 
quarters, or slices. Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, beets, carrots, 
cauliflower and cabbage, peaches, pears, crabapples and grapes 
are the vegetables and fruits most often preserved by pickling. 

Preparing Food for Pickling 

Clean vegetables carefully by scrubbing them in plenty of 
clear water. Then give them a preliminary soaking in a solu- 
tion of salt and water — (one-eighth to one-fourth cup salt to 
one quart water) — for several hours or over night, or even for 
several days. Some vegetables must be parboiled in salt water 
before they are placed in the pickling solution. The salt draws 
the water from the tissues and makes them crisp and firm and 
better prepared to absorb the pickling solution. 

Fruits need no preliminary treatment with salt and water. 
Prepare them as for canning and place them in the pickling 
solution. 

Important Facts About Pickling 

Use porcelain-lined, graniteware or aluminum kettles for 
cooking pickles. Use a granite or wooden spoon for stirring or 
lifting the pickles. 

Too much salt toughens and shrivels the vegetables to be 
pickled. Too strong vinegar may bleach the vegetable or cause 
it to soften after it is pickled. 

The best results are obtained if pickles are sealed in glass or 
stone jars. 

Varieties of Pickles 

Sweet Pickles — ^Fruits, ripe cucumbers and melon-rinds are 
pickled in a sweet, spiced vinegar solution. 

Mixed Pickles — Various combinations of vegetables may be 
pickled together as mixed pickles. 

687 



688 

Relishes— Vegetables chopped fine and pickled are called 
relishes. 

Chow-Chow, Chili Sauce and Piccalilli are forms of 
relishes. 

Chutney — A sweet pickle highly seasoned, made from a 
variety of chopped vegetables or vegetables and fruits, is called 
a chutney. Chutneys are served with cold meats, sausages or 
stews. 

Catchup and Sauces — ^Many fruits and vegetables, espe- 
cially tomatoes, are chopped fine, cooked in the pickling solu- 
tion and strained to form a thick fluid or sauce. 

Tomatoes, Peppers or other vegetables or fruits stuffed with 
various mixtures and pickled are popular in some sections. 

Dill Pickles and Sauerkraut — In these two forms of 
pickk, vinegar is not used. The vegetable is allowed to fer- 
ment in a salt solution and the only acid present is the lactic 
acid formed by the action of the bacteria upon the sugar in 
the vegetable. In dill pickles, the dill is added for flavor. Plain 
salted cucumbers may be prepared in the same way without 
the dill. They are removed from the brine, soaked over night 
in cold water, and put in a pickling vinegar and prepared as 
needed. 

SPICED VINEGAR 

1 quart vinegar 1 tablespoon white mustard 

1 pint sugar seed 

1 tablespoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon cloves 

1 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon salt 

The spices may be used either whole or ground, as one prefers 
a clear or a dark pickle. If they are ground, they should be 
placed in a muslin bag and removed from the solution before 
the pickles are canned. If the pickle is one that is to be heated 
in the vinegar, the vinegar and spices are not previously heated. 
If the pickle is to be placed in the cans cold and the hot vinegar 
is to be poured over it, the solution is brought slowly to the 
boiling-point and then poured over the pickle. 

PICKLED BEETS 

Cook small beets until they are tender. Plunge them into 
cold water and slip off the skins. Cover them with spiced 
vinegar (recipe above), and simmer them for fifteen minutes. 



PICKLES AND RELISHES 689 

Seal them in clean, hot jars. Golden wax beans, the stems of 
Swiss chard, or very small carrots may be pickled in the same 
way. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES 

100 cucumbers 2 teaspoons salt 

Vinegar . 1 cup sugar 

1 ounce mustard seed 2 red peppers 
1 ounce cloves 

Use the smallest cucumbers you can procure, making two and 
one-half inches the limit of length. Put the spices in thin 
muslin bags, using at least two bags. Place the cucumbers in a 
kettle with enough good vinegar of medium strength to cover 
them. Place the bags of spices in the vinegar, together with 
the salt and sugar, and the peppers cut in rings. Heat the vine- 
gar as slowly as possible ; when it is scalding hot but not boiling, 
the pickles are ready to set away. If this recipe is carefully fol- 
lowed, satisfactory results will be obtained. If the vinegar 
boils, the pickles will soften. 

RIPE CUCUMBER SWEET PICKLES 

8 large ripe cucumbers 3 pounds sugar 

Ys pound stick cinnamon lYz pints vinegar 

1 ounce whole cloves 

Pare the cucumbers, quarter and take out the seeds, then 
cut the quarters into medium-sized pieces. Scald in salted water 
(two tablespoons salt to one quart water) , then drain and sim- 
mer in clear water until they are tender but firm. Drain well. 
Tie the spices in a bag and boil them with the vinegar and the 
sugar for five minutes. Pour this mixture over the cucumbers, 
cover the jar and set away. The next day pour off the sirup, 
boil for ten minutes and pour over the cucumbers again. Flavor 
is improved by repeating this process several times. Place the 
pickles in clean, hot jars and seal. 

GREEN CUCUMBER SWEET PICKLES 

No. 1. 

Sweet cucumber pickles made by the following recipe will 
keep for several years without being sealed. 

Choose very small cucumbers. Soak them in weak brine 
(two tablespoons salt to one quart water) over night. Next 



690 



morning remove the cucumbers, scald the brine and skim it, 
turn it over the pickles again and let them stand for two days. 
Repeat this process on the third morning and let the pickles 
stand two days longer. Then scald the brine each morning 
until the eighth day, removing the pickles and pouring the hot 
brine over them each time. On the eighth day, remove the 
pickles from the brine, cover them with spiced vinegar, heat 
thoroughly, and place them in clean, hot jars. 



No. 2. 

7 pounds cucumbers 



1 ounce cinnamon 

2 ounces cloves 



1 tablespoon allspice 
1 quart vinegar 
3 pounds sugar 

Pare, quarter and seed large cucumbers. Wash thoroughly, 
then soak for four days in salt and water (two tablespoons salt 
to one quart water), changing the brine every day. Put the 
spices in a bag. Boil the cucumbers with the vinegar, sugar and 
spice until the cucumbers are clear. It is best to watch care- 
fully and remove each piece when it is clear. Pack in clean, hot 
jars and seal. 

MUSTARD PICKLES 



1 pint cucumbers, about 2 
inches long 

1 pint large cucumbers, sliced 

1 pint pickling onions 

1 cup string beans, cut di- 
agonally in 1-inch pieces 

1 pint small green tomatoes 

1 pint cauliflower, cut in 
small pieces 

3 red peppers, chopped 



3 green peppers, chopped 

1 cup small carrots, or sliced 
carrots halved or quartered 
1^ cups white sugar 

4 tablespoons flour 

Yz tablespoon turmeric 
1 teaspoon celery salt 
Vinegar 

4 tablespoons powdered 
mustard 



All the vegetables should be tender. Soak all the vegetables 
in brine (one cup salt to one gallon water) over night. Drain 
and soak them in clear water for three hours. Mix a sufficient 
amount of vinegar and water, in equal quantities, to cover the 
vegetables. Allow them to stand in this vinegar for one hour, 
then scald them in this liquid. 

Make a dressing by mixing the sugar, flour, mustard, turmeric 
and celery salt and adding three pints of hot vinegar slowly, 
stirring to make a smooth paste. Cook the mixture over a pan 
of hot water until the sauce thickens. 



PICKLES AND RELISHES 691 

Drain the vegetables thoroughly. Pour the mustard dressing 
over them while they are hot, and simmer them for five min- 
utes. Pack the pickle into hot, clean jars and seal. 

DILL PICKLES 

Choose cucumbers over five inches in length. Wash them 
well and pack them in earthenware jars or wooden casks. On 
each layer of cucumbers place a thin layer of dill, stalks, leaves 
and seed balls included. When all are packed in, cover them 
with a brine solution carrying forty per cent, salt (approxi- 
mately two pounds salt to three quarts water). Place a layer 
of grape or horseradish leaves on top and weigh the whole down 
with a clean plate and stone. Two or three weeks will be re- 
quired for curing. 

SPANISH TOMATOES 

24 green tomatoes, sliced 1 tablespoon peppercorns 

1 large onion 1 tablespoon mustard seed 

2 green peppers 1 cup brown sugar 
54 cup salt 2 quarts vinegar 

Alternate layers of sliced tomatoes with layers of sliced onion 
and chopped green peppers, in a large crock, and sprinkle each 
layer with salt. Let stand twenty-four hours, then drain. Put 
the vegetables in a preserving-kettle, add the spices and sugar 
and cover with the vinegar. Cook gently for forty-five min- 
utes. Pack in clean, hot jars and seal. 

PICKLED ONIONS 

Peel small onions until the white is reached. Scald in strong 
salted water (four tablespoons salt to one quart water), then 
drain. Pack in jars and sprinkle white mustard and pepper 
over the onions. Cover them with a boiling hot solution of 
vinegar. When cold, put in clean, cold jars and seal. One 
tablespoon of salad oil may be added to the top of the mixture. 

PICKLED SWEET RED PEPPERS 

Wash the outside of the peppers thoroughly and wipe them 
dry. Cut a slice from the stem end and remove the seeds. Cut 
into thin strips with the scissors, or into long ribbons, working 



692 

around and around the pepper. Scald well and then drop into 
ice-water to crisp them. Drain well. Make a sirup, using a 
proportion of one cup of sugar to two cups of vinegar. Put the 
peppers into clean, hot jars, fill to overflowing with hot sirup, 
and seal. 

PEPPER MANGOES 

Green peppers 2 tablespoons white mustard 

Brine seed 

1 quart chopped cabbage 1 tablespoon cinnamon 

1 tablespoon salt 1 cup sugar 

1 tablespoon cloves Vinegar 

Remove the stem ends of green peppers, carefully extract the 
seeds and midribs and lay the peppers in strongly salted water 
(one-half cup salt to two quarts water) for twenty-four hours. 
Chop the cabbage fine and add the salt, mustard seed, cloves, 
cinnamon and sugar, mixing them well. Drain the peppers, 
stuff them with the prepared cabbage, replace the pepper caps 
and tie them in position. Pack the peppers in a stone jar and 
cover them with strong cold vinegar. They will be ready to 
use in two or three weeks. 

PICKLED SECKEL PEARS 

7 pounds Seckel pears 1 tablespoon cinnamon 

1 pint vinegar ,1 tablespoon allspice 

1 pint water 1 tablespoon cloves 
3 Yz pounds sugar 

Pare the fruit, remove the blossom end, but leave the stem on. 
Make a sirup of the vinegar, water, sugar and spice, boiled for 
five minutes. Add the fruit and cook until clear. Seal in hot, 
clean jars.

CASSEROLE AND OVEN 
COOKERY 



THE expression "en casserole" Is sometimes misunderstood 
becaiise the word "casserole" is used in two quite different 
ways by writers on domestic subjects. Properly speaking, a 
casserole is the coarse clay saucepan, so common in France, 
in which meats and vegetables are not only cooked but served 
on the table. In its other usage the word is applied to a case 
or mold of potato, rice or fried bread, inside of which is placed 
some preparation of meat or vegetables. The word in this case 
really signifies a border or croustade. Directions for using this 
second form of casserole will be found in the chapter on entrees. 



Varieties of Casseroles 

Casseroles of different sizes, shapes and materials, are con- 
venient additions to the cooking equipment, and should be 
chosen with consideration for the needs of the family. They 
come in many sizes from the individual ramekin up to one 
that will hold two chickens. They may be had in various 
shapes — oval and round, shallow and deep. They are made in 
a variety of materials — glass, vitrified china, earthenware, iron 
and aluminum — and in a color-range that allows one to choose 
according to personal preference — brown, yellow, green, blue 
and mixtures. 

Care of Casseroles 

Casseroles will last indefinitely if properly treated. It is wise 
to avoid a sudden and great change in temperature, such as 
occurs when a casserole is taken from a hot oven and placed in 
a wet sink. It is not advisable to set a glass or earthenware 
casserole over a high flame without an asbestos mat under it. A 
new casserole may be tempered and made more tough by pour- 
ing cold water into and about it, and bringing it gradually to 
the boiling-point.

Advantages of Cooking In a Casserole 

The Casserole Saves Dish-Washing, because it makes it 
possible to bring food to the table in the dish in which it was 
cooked. Frequently, also, it contains a "one-dish meal" which 
eliminates all but the one cooking dish. 

The Casserole Makes it Possible to Use Left-Overs in 
attractive, palatable combinations, to cook tough meats tender, 
and to prepare vegetables in an almost unlimited variety of 
ways. Any vegetable may be boiled, steamed, baked, scalloped 
or creamed, and cabbage, cucumbers, eggplant, onions, peppers, 
potatoes or tomatoes may be stuflFed and cooked in the casserole. 

Food Cooked in this Way Needs Little Watching, it 
may be kept warm and still attractive if the meal is delayed, 
and there is no loss of vegetable or meat juices. These juices con- 
tain a valuable part of the food which is often thrown away, 
especially in the case of vegetables that are boiled. 

A Whole Meal May be Cooking in the Oven in the 
casserole while the oven is being used for some other purpose, 
such as baking cookies. The cover of the casserole should fit 
well into the dish, so that it is practically airtight, a fact that 
should be borne in mind when the casserole is purchased. If 
the oven must be kept very hot for something else, set the 
casserole in a pan of water so that the food within will sim- 
mer, not boil. As the water becomes hot, take out part of it 
and add cool water to keep it at the desired temperature. 

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE 

1 chicken 12 potato balls 

Butter, salad oil, or other fat 1 carrot, sliced 

1 pint rich brown stock 6 small onions

Wash the chicken and cut it up. Saute the pieces in a little 
fat until well browned on all sides. Place in a greased casserole, 
add brown stock, cover and cook in a slow to moderate oven 
(350° F.) for an hour. 

When the chicken has been cooking for an hour, saute the 
carrot slices, the potato balls, the onions and the mushrooms 
in a little fat, stirring them lightly around until they are well 
browned. Put these with the chicken in the casserole, season 
with salt, pepper and paprika, add more salt if needed, cover

other fat in a casserole, slice a mild Spanish onion over the fat, 
arrange the pigeons on the onion in the casserole, cover the 
casserole and set over a low heat with an asbestos mat under 
the casserole to protect it from direct heat and to insure slow 
cooking. Cook on top of the stove for fifteen minutes. Add 
enough veal broth or white stock to half cover the pigeons and 
set in the oven (350° P.) to cook until tender (2-2^ hrs.). 
When nearly done, vegetables may be added. At serving-time

oven (400°-450° F.) until the bananas are tender. The cover 
may be removed at the last moment and the bananas sprinkled 
with granulated sugar and allowed to brown slightly. Serve 
as an entree with game, mutton, or beef. 

AU GRATIN DISHES EN CASSEROLE 

Au gratin dishes, many of which are given in this book, are 
particularly adapted to the casserole. The mixtures of chicken, 
sweetbreads, fish, macaroni and vegetables may be entirely pre- 
pared, then placed in the casserole, topped with buttered 
crumbs and cheese and placed in a hot oven (400° -450° F.) 
to brown. 

Eggs Yorkshire — 

y2 cup fat 1 cup pastry flour 

2 eggs, beaten 1 teaspoon baking powder 

1 cup milk 1/^ teaspoon salt 

4 hard or soft cooked eggs 

Place casserole with fat in oven to melt. Remove fat to use 
in batter, leaving enough to grease casserole thoroughly. Re- 
turn casserole to oven to heat. Beat eggs and milk thoroughly; 
add baking powder, flour, salt and fat and beat mixture until 
smooth. Cover bottom of casserole with layer of eggs (whole, 
halved, quartered or sliced). Pour in batter until casserole is 
about Yi full and place in hot oven (450° F.) for 15 minutes 
until mixture begins to expand and brown slightly, then reduce 
to 350° F. for 25 minutes. The batter should puff nicely during 
baking, making an attractive uneven broken surface. Serve at 
once from baking dish. 

Salmon Casserole — 

1 1 -pound can salmon 2 cups prepared biscuit 

J/3 cup milk flour 

y2 pound American cheese % cup milk 

Flake salmon in casserole. Melt cheese in top of a double 
boiler; add Ys cup milk while stirring. Pour over salmon. Mix 
biscuit flour and % cup milk and make biscuits. Cut each in 
half and place around edge of casserole. Bake in hot oven 
(425° F.) until lightly browned. 



COOKING FOR TWO 



THE problem here is really more one of planning and 
marketing than of actual cooking. No roast leg of lamb 
or baked ham of course, no standing rib roast of beef, not 
often a whole watermelon. But it is possible to buy cuts of 
meat and to plan the other marketing so that to all intents and 
purposes these favorites may form part of the menu even for 
the smallest family. Moreover, many dishes which are too 
expensive to be served to a large and hungry family are often 
possible for a family of two. 

Cooking Equipment for Two 

It is impossible to cook small quantities satisfactorily in large 
dishes; so the first thing to do is to buy dishes and utensils of 
the right size. The following list is given as a suggestion. 

A small casserole or a large ramekin for soiiffles and casserole dishes, 
to be used either for the meat course or for baked puddings. 

Individual ramekins and custard cups. 

A small frying-pan for cooking eggs, bacon, etc. 

A small baking-pan for roasting meat. 

Small saucepans and kettles for vegetables and other boiled foods. 
The saucepans that fit together, two or three on a single burner, are 
especially good for the small family. 

A deep pot of small diameter for deep fat frying and a wire 
strainer that will fit down inside it to be used as a frying basket. 

A double boiler holding one quart. 

MuflSn pans in sets of six. 

Layer cake and pie pans five or six inches in diameter. 

A small square or oblong shallow pan for baking sheets of cake, 
ginger-bread, etc. 

A small loaf pan for breads, loaf cakes and meat loaves. 

A set of skewers for serving "en brochette." 

A cup sized egg beater. 

Small bowls. 

An ice cream freezer either of the crank or vacuum type, holding 
from one pint to one quart. 

The small ovens for use on top of the stove are very convenient 
for baking two or three potatoes or apples or a small dish of rice 
pudding, custard and similar desserts.

COOKING FOR TWO 711 



How to Modify Recipes 

Most of the recipes in the American Woman's Cook Book are 
planned for six j>ersons. Many of them can be cut down to one- 
half or one-third and made exactly as though the entire quantity 
were used. It is often more advantageous to cut the recipe in 
half rather than thirds, since it is sometimes harder to work 
with small amounts and there is relatively greater waste from 
food adhering to pans and spoons. 

In Cooking Over Direct Fire or in the oven, the loss of 
moisture will be comparatively larger than in the larger quan- 
tity recipe, so a little more Hquid may be used. This is true 
particularly in recipes that use cream sauces and in meat casse- 
roles. 

Recipes Including Eggs are more easily made if they can 
be divided to the one or two egg quantity. If less than one 
egg has to be used, there are two ways of doing it: Either use 
a very small egg or beat the egg slightly and divide it, keeping 
the unused portion for some other dish. It might be well to 
say, however, that a little more egg than the recipe calls for 
will not generally do any harm. So if you are not considering 
economy you will be safe in using a whole egg even though the 
rest of the ingredients are cut down. 

With Yeast Dough it is advisable to use a larger quantity 
of yeast, proportionately, than would be used in the full recipe. 
For instance, if the recipe calls for one yeast cake, and you are 
cutting it down to one-third or one-half, it will be wise to use 
the whole yeast cake, or the greater part of it, in order to hasten 
the process. Those recipes which demand no kneading are 
easier than the kneaded ones to handle in small quantities. 

For Soups, allow from one-half cup to one cup for each 
person, the amount depending upon the kind of soup you are 
making and whether you are serving it in cups or plates. 

For Desserts, allow from one-half cup to three-quarters cup 
for each serving. 

Of Creamed Dishes, vegetables, etc., about two-thirds cup 
is served, but an allowance for a second portion should be made. 



712 



To Use One Recipe in Different Ways 

Often a full recipe can be made and used in different ways 
for several occasions. 

The Recipe for Creamed Chicken, for instance, will 
provide enough for an au gratin oven dish. 

A Rich Baking Powder Biscuit Dough will make short- 
cakes for one meal, toasted biscuits for another, and, if baked 
in a sheet and covered with cinnamon and sugar, coffee-cake for 
a third. 

Pie Dough will make pies, tart shells for meat or dessert, 
cheese strips for soup or salad, and tiny jam turnovers for after- 
noon tea. 

Cake Batter may be baked as loaves, layers, sheets or cup 
cakes, as cottage pudding, to be served hot with a sauce, or as 
a ring in which to serve fruit, jelly or a creamed dessert. A 
fruit cake mixture may be baked as fruit cake or steamed in 
small molds and served hot with sauce. 

How to Use Left-Overs 

The problem of cooking for two depends to a great extent 
for its solution upon the ability to use left-overs attractively 
at successive meals. In using this surplus food, it is important 
to supply whatever is lacking. If it is dry it needs to be moist- 
ened; if it is hard it needs to be softened; if it is not of any 
particular flavor it needs to be well seasoned or mixed with some- 
thing that will give it a distinctive and appetizing taste. 

Sometimes it is "Well to Keep Your Left-Overs Un- 
cooked. For instance, if you have a steak that is too large for 
one meal, because in order to have it appetizing you had to 
have it cut fairly thick, cut out the heart or tenderloin and broil 
it, keeping the rest for a fresh-meat casserole the next day. 

Any Small Pieces of Uncooked Meat may be made at- 
tractive by broiling on the skewer or preparing as a mixed grill 
or a mixed fried dish. For any of these there need be only a 
few small pieces of meat with accessories such as half a dozen 
mushrooms, a few slices of potato, an onion or two, small cubes 
^f egg-plant or turnip or other vegetables, a few curls of bacon 
or a tiny sausage or two. To cook "en brochette" dip the small 
pieces of meat and vegetable in melted butter and impale them 
on the skewer. Bacon and sausage of course need no butter. 



COOKING FOR TWO 713 

Put the skewer on the broiling rack and broil, turning oc- 
casionally. For a mixed grill, any meat or vegetable that can 
be put under the broiler may be used. Slices of tomato, egg- 
plant and pineapple give interesting variety. 

Meats for Two 

The following types of meat dishes are as easily served to 
two as to six: 

Hamburg balls or steak Chop suey 

Lamb, mutton, veal or pork Sausages 

chops Scrapple 

Liver Dried beef 

Kidneys Sliced ham 

Sweetbreads Bacon 

Ox tails Salt pork 

Roasts — ^Instead of a large roast of beef, buy a thick steak, 
roll, tie and roast it in a very hot oven (450°-500° F.) for a 
short time. If even this is too large a roast, cut out the heart 
for roasting and keep the rest for a casserole dish. 

For Lamb, Mutton and Veal Roasts, buy loin chops — as 
many as you require. Have the bones separated at the joints 
but do not have the meat cut through. Cook as a standing 
roast. 

For Baked Ham, buy a one- inch thick slice of raw ham. 
Brown it on both sides in the frying-pan, then cover it with 
mustard, flour and sugar and stuff the top with cloves. Add a 
little water and cook, covered, in a moderate oven (350° F.) 
for an hour. 

In Place of Stuffed Shoulder of Lamb, mutton or veal, 
buy a slice of the meat and spread it with any desired stuffing. 
Roll, with the stuffing inside. This may be browned first and 
then baked, or may be put immediately into the oven. 

For Pot Roasts a one pound or two pound piece will be 
quite as satisfactory as a larger one, though it may require a 
little more watching while it is cooking. 

Poultry — A whole turkey, of course, is out of the question, 
but poultry may be enjoyed in the shape of a broiling chicken 
or guinea chick, or squab and the smaller game birds, quail and 
grouse. These can be broiled, fried or baked. The pigeon is 
nice in a pie. 



714 



Fish 

"Whole Fish that will serve six or more persons are not a 
wise purchase for the small family. Either buy small fish, such 
as smelts, perch and butterfish, or a steak or fillet from one of 
the large fish — ^halibut, cod, haddock, salmon and the like. 

Shell Fish are particularly well suited to the needs of the 
small family. It is possible to buy just the right amount of 
clams, oysters, shrimps, hard and soft-shelled crabs, and some- 
times a lobster just large enough for two is procurable. Shad 
roe and frogs' legs are luxuries that are more often possible for 
the small family than for the large family^ 

Vegetables 

The Large Vegetables will give left-overs that can be used 
in many ways. A small cabbage makes one nice salad, and, a 
few days later, one cooked dish. Winter squash can be used 
up in pies and custards. An egg-plant will give one-half for 
stuffing and baking and several slices for frying, with some, 
j>erhaps left to cook in Oriental style. Left-over cooked cauli- 
flower may be served cold as a salad, or scalloped. 

The Smaller Vegetables, fresh peas, beans, carrots, beets, 
potatoes, etc., can be bought and cooked in exactly the quantity 
required, though, as all of these are good for use in salads, it 
is generally wise to cook a little more than you need for one 
meal. 

Spaghetti, Macaroni and Noodles are often served as a 
vegetable. These, of course, are easily managed if there are 
cooking utensils of the right size. 

Soups 

Any Creamed Vegetable Soup can be made in a pint 
quantity. 

A Quart of Meat Stock can be made from the bones and 
trimmings of meat purchased for other cooking, and whatever is 
not needed for soup can be made into gravies and sauces for 
following days. A thickened meat stock containing small pieces 
of meat and plenty of diced vegetables makes a substantial dish. 



COOKING FOR TWO 715 



Breads 

One Loaf of Yeast Bread can be made at a time, and 
quickly, if the proportion of yeast is increased. 

Any Baking Powder Mixture can be mixed in the desired 
quantity, and almost any kind of loaf can be made with it — 
white, whole wheat, graham, oatmeal, bran, nut, raisin, etc. 
Baked in a small pan, these loaves will be used up before they 
are dry. 

Biscuits and Muffins are the ideal home made bread for the 
small family. 

Pancakes and Waffles are always possible, and may be 
served as breakfast or luncheon breads, as accompaniments to 
meat or chicken, or as a dessert, with fruit, honey, maple sirup 
or a sauce. With a table griddle or iron they can be cooked 
in the dining-room and served piping hot. 

Cakes 

A Layer or Loaf Cake which can be consumed in one or 
two meals can be baked in small pans. Half of an average 
recipe will make two of these small layers as well as several cup 
cakes or a sheet which can be cut into squares and frosted or 
not as desired. 

If Rolled Cookies Are Too Much Trouble, use any 
recipe for drop cookies. These can be flattened out with a 
knife and made as thin as you wish. 

Desserts 

Puddings — ^With individual custard cups or ramekins or with 
one large enough to serve two, practically any baked pudding 
is possible, and with these same molds, custards or any of the 
cold puddings are easily molded. The recipes need no change 
other than cutting them to the desired quantity. It is as easy to 
make one cup of custard or gelatin as it is to make a quart. 

Most steamed puddings improve with keeping, so it is quite 
possible to make an entire recipe, steam it in small molds, and 
keep the extra ones for future need. They can be reheated in 
the top of a double boiler or in a pan, surrounded by water, in 
the oven. For strawberry shortcake of the old fashioned va- 
riety, cut the crust with a biscuit cutter and make individual 



7i6 

shortcakes. For a sweet shortcake, bake the batter in muflSn 
pans. Cottage pudding, souffles, and similar desserts may be 
baked in custard cups or ramekins and either turned out or 
served in the dish with or without sauce. 

Pies — A small sized pan will make as good a pie as a large 
one. If an extra shell is baked at the same time as a two-crust 
pie, it can be kept for several days, then reheated to freshen it 
and filled with a custard, cream or lemon filling. Individual 
tart shells made with the muffin tins, or turnovers just large 
enough to serve one person make a variation in form. 

Fruits 

These offer little difficulty, since most of them come in in- 
dividual portions. If you feel impelled to buy the large fruits, 
such as watermelon, honeydew and casaba melons, and pine- 
apple, serve them in different ways so that they do not become 
tiresome before they are eaten up. From the pineapple make 
a fruit cup, a salad, an open tart, frosting for cake or a delicious 
sherbet or ice-cream. After the first slices of melon have been 
used, cut balls and allow them to stand in fruit juice. Serve, 
chilled, as a fruit cup. Watermelon can be used for a cooling 
sherbet or frappe and the other melons make interesting fruit 
salads. 

Nuts 

These should not be' forgotten in planning meals for two. 
Chestnuts, for example, make a delicious vegetable with meat 
when boiled and buttered or creamed. Chestnut puree with 
sweetened whipped cream is an unusual and delicious dessert. 
Blanched walnuts are particularly nice in making many dishes 
and can be roasted with a little oil or butter and served hot and 
crisp with meat. 

Canned and Packaged Goods for Two 

Although it is easy to feed a family of two with home 
cooked fresh foods, as shown by the preceding suggestions, 
an acquaintance with the possibilities of canned and packaged 
goods is important to the manager of a very small household. 
This is particularly so in the case of one who does work outside 
her home, or who makes her home in a kitchenette apartment 
where space-saving is a major consideration. 



COOKING FOR TWO 



717 



Canned Vegetables eliminate the time-consuming opera- 
tions of washing, scraping or paring, and simpUfy the problem 
of garbage disposal, which must always follow the preparation 
of fresh vegetables. 

Fruits, Vegetables, Meats and Fish of many kinds come 
in cans of various sizes, so that it is possible to buy the size that 
best suits your requirements. 

Ready-to-Mix piecrust, pancake, cake and pastry flours 
shorten the time and reduce the number of utensils needed for 
mixing pies, biscuits, pancakes, mufiins and cakes. 

Fruits and Nuts in Cans or Jars of suitable size are always 
ready for salads, desserts, appetizers and garnishes. 

Condensed, Evaporated and Powdered Milk may be kept 
in small space and, if not kept too long before they are opened, 
do not require a refrigerator temperature, as fresh milk does. 

Steamed Puddings, pie-fillings, ready-to-mix pudding in- 
gredients, canned Welsh rarebit, chicken a la king, baked beans, 
spaghetti in savory sauces, soups of all varieties and countless 
other aids are at your service to help you serve varied and appe- 
tizing meals however limited your time or culinary space.

COOKING AT THE TABLE 



THE small table cookers of various kinds — grills, chafing- 
dishes, waffle irons, muffin irons, pancake griddles, toasters 
and coffee percolators — make informal entertaining a pleasure 
to the hostess as well as to the guests. 

Meals cooked at the table must of course be simple. It is 
usually wise to confine a supper to one hot dish, with such 
accessories as bread and butter, toast, crackers or cold sand- 
wiches, a hot drink or a cold drink or both. If something more 
elaborate is desirable, the meal may begin with a fruit cocktail 
or a simple salad and end with a dessert that is easily served. 
Relishes, such as celery and olives, are easily provided. 



Suggestions for Table Cookery 

It will help you to entertain successfully in this manner, if 
you will keep in mind the following suggestions: 

1. Prepare Ahead of Time everything that can be pre- 
pared. Have the table spread with all that is needed in the way 
of china, silver and glass. Arrange the sandwiches, relishes and 
other cold accessories attractively and conveniently. 

2. Have on Hakd Everything That is to be Used in the 
hot dish, and have it prepared as far as it is possible to prepare 
it. Meat or fish or vegetables should be nicely diced, cheese 
grated, oysters drained, and eggs broken into a bowl, unless they 
are to be cooked separately, as in poaching or frying. Lack of 
preparation often results in tiresome delays and unappetizing 
confusion, but with everything in readiness the one hot dish 
is easily put together before the guests become tired of watching 
the process. 

3. Be Sure That Your Equipment is Sufficient to pro- 
vide for the needs of your guests. If you are giving a waffle 
party, do not invite more guests than your waffle iron will 
easily serve, so that no one need wait hungrily while others are 
eating. The same thing holds true with table grills and chafing- 
dishes. There should be enough creamed chicken or Welsh 
rabbit to serve everyone generously at the same time. 

718 



COOKING AT THE TABLE 7\9 

4. If Your Cookers are Electric, be sure that your wires 
are heavy enough to bear the load without blowing out a fuse. 

Unless you have special wiring and sturdy convenience out- 
lets, it is safer not to attempt to use a grill or wafiJe iron plus 
a percolator on the same circuit. Plan to use first cwie and then 
the other, or you may melt a fuse when the meal is but half 
ready, leaving your guests hungry for that always indefinite 
period until it may be replaced,

add the remainder of the milk and stir into the roux. When 
the mass is of the consistency of cream, add the lobster, cut up 
coarsely, and, when thoroughly heated, serve. If using the fresh

THE FRIENDS 
WHO HONOR US 



For many families, the pleasant comings of friends and neigh- 
bors have no further purpose than warm interchange of plans 
and ideas over a cup of tea or coffee. 

But some believe that life is lived with one's associates and 
that learning to know them simplifies business and professional 
as well as personal relationships. This does not mean that social 
life shall be stilted or rigid, even when formal — quite the con- 
trary is usually the sought-after end. Clear thinking, honest 
motives and ease in management can develop a social life that 
is simple and charming. 

The guest list must be carefully considered. "When inviting 
persons for the purpose of introducing them to someone else, 
be sure that as far as can be discovered, there is no third person 
to inject a discordant note. One cannot take full responsibility 
for the emotional responses of all one's friends and acquaintances, 

724

but some caution can and should be exercised. When enter- 
taining a group of professionals it is well to have several pro- 
fessions represented so that conversation will be general and 
pleasant, and not turn to moot professional questions that may 
start a sharp debate. 

Many families, too, see in their social life an opportunity to 
train their children in the social graces and amenities. This, of 
course, can be overdone if not carefully thought out. Many 
guests are not interested in children and some are annoyed by 
them. But family parties are always the logical and pleasant 
opportunity to give the youngsters their chance. In any case, 
children should be prepared for what is ahead of them. Being 
more at ease in their own minds about what may happen and 
what is expected of them, they are much less likely to "show off*' 
or behave like the "enfant terrible." Being reminded of the 
uses of knife, fork, and napkin beforehand, too, and not rep- 
rimanded in the presence of others, will make for better 
behavior. 

ENTERTAINING WITHOUT A MAID 

Many women can manage almost any form of entertainment 
without the help of a maid. For most, however, there are dis- 
tinct limits to what should be attempted for pleasant and digni- 
fied results. The disappearance of the dining room and the 
substitution of a bay or alcove in the living room has increased 
the ease of servantless entertaining at the table. Many small 
pieces of furniture are especially designed to add to the efficiency 
of the hostess and the comfort of her guests, such as the drop- 
leaf, gate-leg and butterfly tables, double-decked tea carts, 
muffin stands and butler's trays. The menu should be planned 
to avoid last minute activities on the part of the hostess. She 
should be free to greet and atten<l her guests. All the extra 
china and glass necessary should be on one of the small tables 
within the hostess' reach and china removed can be placed out of 
sight on the lower shelf of the table or the low butler's tray. 
Extra bread, butter, wafers, sauces and water are also on the 
auxiliary table. If arrangements are well planned, the hostess 
need not leave her chair until it is time to clear, and serve the 
dessert. At that time, too, the coffee can be started. The coffee 
service has previously been placed at a convenient spot in the 
living room, and the screen to be used for enclosing the table 



726 



when it has been left is at an easily accessible place. (See page 
82.) As the guests leave the table for the living room, the hostess 
enters with the coffee while the host attends to placing the 
screen. By the time all have lighted a fresh cigarette, the coffee 
is being poured and the dining table has been forgotten. 

BUFFET SERVICE 

Until very recently the only buffet was an informal type of 
service in which everyone served himself and his partner from a 
refectory table set against one side of the living or dining room. 
The table is spread with the best cloth and laid with the best 
china and silver if the occasion is formal, or with an informal 
cloth and pottery, copper, chrome and wood for a man's buffet 
or a sports party. Decorations are in keeping with the occasion 
and the appointments. Silver is laid in groups, plates are stacked 
and napery is laid in a tilted pile. Only one or two hot dishes 
are served and all the food is brought to the table at the begin- 
ning, except for necessary replenishing. 

The currently popular buffet dinner is another way to manage 
a maidless dinner. Guests are seated at card tables placed in the 
living room or other open space, wherever they can be com- 
fortably seated and served. The extended dining table is set 
much as for the usual buffet, except that it is away from the 
wall so guests may walk around it. The small tables are set 
for the usual four with a complete service at each place. If there 
are flowers or other decorations they should be very small and 
low. Small fruits in low bowls are effective. The large table, 
however, may be very elaborately adorned with both flowers 
and candles. Friends or members of the family may be asked to 
assist and the host should be occupied in seeing that everyone 
is seated comfortably. Sometimes older people, unacquainted 
with this form of service, become confused and need help. Second 
helpings, fresh water and butter are brought to the small tables 
by host, hostess or those assisting. 

For more hilarious parties, still on the grown-up side, there 
are those in which each couple brings one course, the hostess 
providing the hot one and coffee. There is also the dinner at 
which all hands help. This takes some organizing to keep the 
guests from colliding and from clogging the kitchen, but if 
well planned, can be a great source of fun and not much more 
formal than a studio party. 



THE FRIENDS WHO HONOR US 727 

More formal and peculiarly adapted to servantless entertain- 
ing is after-dinner coffee and liqueurs. Invitations are usually 
issued for "9 p. m. to Midnight" and since these parties are 
particularly popular among bachelors and professional people 
— ^physicians, newspaper people and musicians — guests arrive at 
their own convenient time. There is usually music from 10 
to 11, giving the earlier arrivals an opportunity to have their 
coffee and conversation first and the latecomers to have theirs 
afterwards. 

THE "RUMPUS" ROOM 

The retirement of solid fuels from domestic consumption has 
resulted, in recent years, in the rearrangement of basement space 
to provide for the Rumpus room. This room takes many forms 
and is as variously equipped as there are types of basements and 
of household ideas. It ranges from the simple, cleared space al- 
lotted to children's indoor play to the elaborate, professionally 
decorated English Taproom. In many of the simpler types there 
are provisions for some sort of cooking, an electric grill or a 
fireplace before which corn may be popped, or chestnuts, wieners 
and marshmallows roasted. Without cooking equipment, food 
prepared in the kitchen is served here. All Rumpus room parties 
are of the most informal type and the menus planned should 
reflect this spirit. Picnic menus serve best: hamburgs and 
wieners on rolls, small steaks, chops and bacon, sandwiches, whole 
pickles, radishes, tomatoes, olives, deviled eggs, whole fruit, 
doughnuts and cider, beer, lemonade or ginger ale. If there is a 
fireplace, use it for the camp cookery children enjoy on hikes — 
potatoes, sweet potatoes, whole eggs or onions done in the hot 
ashes. Clever boys and their fathers will be able to manage more 
complicated things. The room is, of course, the ideal spot for 
taffy pulls and popcorn-ball parties of the oldsters' childhood. 
Entertainment takes the form of games. 

COCKTAIL PARTIES 

Another form of entertaining that lends itself to the maid- 
less home is the cocktail party. Men and women living alone, 
as well as householders, find this a simple method of bringing 
their friends together in both small and large numbers. The 
larger the party, the more formal it is apt to be but this need not 
necessarily hold. A refectory table against the wall is the usual 



728 



setting but nothing is served that cannot be eaten with the fin- 
gers. No individual silver is necessary and only a tiny napkin is 
used. Drinks are the special province of the host. He will make 
up his own shopping list and often does his own buying. He 
will know the particular tastes and aversions of many of the 
guests (in a small party, of all of them) and guide himself ac- 
cordingly. A woman alone will have a relative or friend act in 
this capacity. Likewise, a man entertaining alone may ask his 
sister or friend to attend to the menu. Served with the drinks 
are tiny and attractive open sandwiches, made of tart, smoked or 
spiced ingredients. Sweets are never used, except that in every 
group there are those who do not use spirituous liquors, for what- 
ever reason. For them, there should be fruit juices, ginger ale, 
f ruitades or whatever taste dictates. Then serve sweets. In addi- 
tion there should be olives, small pickles, stuffed celery, carrot 
strips, potato chips in their various shapes or salted nuts. In 
cold weather hot hors d'oeuvres served with a toothpick are 
especially acceptable: small filled broiled mushrooms, broiled 
cocktail sausages with or without a bacon wrapping, broiled 
olives wrapped in bacon and many others. It is well to remember 
that all varnished furniture needs protection from the occasional 
careless guest. The foot of every stemmed glass should be pro- 
vided with a jacket, and tall glasses equally well protected. 
Have plenty of coasters in addition. 

OUTDOOR PARTIES 

Interest in out-of-doors dining has long been evident in Amer-.- 
ican families, somewhat colored by local facilities. When a lake 
and beach are available, then campfires, beach parties, fish fries 
and clambakes vie with picnics and steak fries. Many com- 
miunities encourage these outdoor activities by providing picnic 
grounds and camp sites, often equipped with open-air fireplaces, 
tables, benches and other necessary facilities. Recently, however, 
many families have discovered that they may serve any meal 
out of doors on their own premises with very little effort and 
much pleasure. A screened-in porch, a level terrace, a planted 
back yard serves admirably or, if very fortunate, a garden 
planted and equipped as an outdoor living room. The handy 
man about the house or the local carpenter can build collapsible 
tables or hinged ones against the house wall, rush or picket 
screens and canvas-covered or wooden chairs, at little expense.

using waterproof materials and finish. Since this is a warm- 
weather arrangement, there need be Uttle concern for hot 
dishes, but it adds to convenience if an electric outlet can be 
available for making coffee and toast and keeping such dishes 
hot while serving. There need be little change in the menu 
when food is served at home. For transporting some distance, 
elaborate menus and complicated dishes should be avoided; steaks, 
chops, wieners, bacon, broilers and hamburgs to broil over an 
open fire if available; rolls of the proper shape; potato, cabbage, 
coleslaw or other small vegetable salad; whole tomatoes, radishes, 
olives, carrots; whole fruits, cookies, cupcakes or doughnuts. 
Beverages such as coffee, milk, or chocolate are carried in thermos 
bottles or in their own containers if beer or canned fruit juices. 
An ample supply of paper plates, cups, napkins, etc., should be 
at hand and used to build the fire that disposes of all refuse at the 
end of the meal. Be very sure the fire is completely extinguished 
before you leave it.

WINE SEASONS FINE FOOD 



WINE seasons fine food and kindles delight in dining adven- 
tures. Until we have ample time in which to train our 
palates, the nice distinctions between the great vintages must 
remain an occtJt problem, but our education and our pleasure 
can be increased immediately by a somewhat cursory survey of 
the accepted laws for the serving of wine and for its use in 
cookery. 

The fermented juice of grapes is the base of all wines. Except 
for the so-called fortified wines, there are two main headings 
for imported and domestics alike — red and white. The white 
types vary from a pale beige to a deep amber; the red ones show 
an even greater color variation. The latter should grow slightly 
light with age. If a red wine does not do so, it has been toned up 
in its youth. White wines, on the contrary, gain body and grow 
more golden with the lapse of years. 

This passage of time affects wine as it does humans, for wine 
is a living thing. It becomes sick; it recovers; it is affected by 
the seasons, by heat and cold; it grows old; it dies — all this even 
after it has been bottled. 

The term "good year" (we quote a chart on the opposite page 
for important French wines) merely means that the balance of 
sun and moisture of that particular year was propitious to super- 
lative wine. In general, it is wiser to buy a fair wine of a good 
year than a famous brand of a poor year. 

For daily use, still wines are suggested. If you are serving a 
single wine, serve a white wine when your main dish is a fish or a 
light type of meat; to accompany beef, lamb, and the like, a red 
wine is advised. Claret is the customary red wine for frequent 
service. 

Claret at its best comes from the Bordeaux district of France. 
In that district the vineyards are large enough to permit the 
owners to carry out all the processes of growing, pressing, 
bottling and storing on their own land. Hence their brand 
names — ^usually the names of their chateaux — are guarantees of 
uniform quality. Red Bordeaux are lighter than most other red 
wines. 

White Bordeaux come from the same district and are, gener- 

737 



7^ 

ally speaking, sweet wines. Sauternes and Graves are two famed 
classifications. 

Burgundies come from a very small district extending south- 
ward from Dijon for some thirty-five miles. The upper portion 
produces the great red Burgundies ; the southern portion supplies 
lighter kinds and the great white Burgundies. Bottling at the 
property is infrequent, for the holdings of a proprietor are small

and scattered. As a result Burgundies are commonly sold under 
the name of a township, and your greatest protection in their 
purchase is the reputation of the purveyor. 

White Burgundies are dry, with one or two exceptions. 
The term "dry" denotes a "less sweet" wine. Rieslings and 
Chablis, for example, are dryer than Barsac or Sauterne. How- 
ever, there is no fixed standard of dryness for all Chablis or all 
Rieslings. It is a relative matter that varies not only with the 
type and brand but with the particular years of growth. De- 
pend on your wine merchant for detailed advice. 

In addition to Bordeaux and Burgundy, Anjou, Alsace, and 
the Rhone valley produce excellent French wines. The best 
German wines are white and should be chilled. Italian wines 
are heavier than either French or German, more heady. Nearly 
every country in Europe grows grapes and makes wine. Though 
France, Germany and Italy are the great wine exporting coun- 
tries, the others ship their choicest varieties to the rest of the 
wine drinking world. Our domestic wines cannot be charted 
reliably as yet. We have some very fine vineyards and need only 
time to ripen our pressings and to establish uniform standards. 
Young wine is suitable for daily use, but fine wines must be 
ripened under expert supervision for eight or more years before 
they attain their full glory. 

Fortified wines include sherry, madeira and port. Brandy has 
been added to the natural wine. This increase in alcoholic con- 
tent prolongs their keeping qualities and permits storage in up- 
right positions. 

Champagne needs no introduction. By complicated processes, 
the wine is aerated and the corking and recorking is a mortien- 
tous and difficult technique. 

Wine Sequence (or Service Sequence) — ^Wines reverse the 
usual order of hospitality. Your most august wine should be 
accorded the last place if you are serving more than one kind. 
The theorists hold that your wine tasting ability is not toned up 
to a proper appreciation of the unrivaled grandeur of a fine wine 
at the beginning of a dinner. 

Englishmen customarily serve sherry with clear soups but 
Frenchmen consider that the sherry is too vivid a wine to precede 
the dry white wine that accompanies the entree or fish. 

Never serve a sweet wine before a dry one, nor a rich, fruity 
Burgundy before a claret. 



740 

In serving two wines, select a rather dry white wine to ac- 
company your fish or entree and a red wine for your meat 
course. 

In serving three wines, the following make the best combi- 
nations: 

A. White, red, Champagne 

B. White, red, white 

C. White, red, red. 

In the case of "B," the second white wine should be sweet. 
In the case of "C," the greater of the red wines comes second. 

Champagne is served with the dessert if several wines are 
provided. 

Liqueurs are served with coffee in the drawing room or in the 
dining room at the close of dinner. Cognac is the most popular. 
However, Benedictine, Cointreau, Chartreuse and Creme de 
Menthe have many devoted admirers. Englishmen often drink 
port at the close of dinner. 

Italians and Frenchmen habitually dilute their ordinary red 
wine with water for a daily beverage. Never add ice or very 
icy water to wine, for the sudden chilling ruins its flavor. 

The Amount to Serve — Wine is best appreciated when it is 
drunk in moderation, as a food, as a pleasure and not as a thirst 
quencher or stimulant. Plan a total allowance of a half bottle 
to each guest. Thus a table of eight will require two bottles of 
each of the principal wines or four bottles if you are serving 
only one variety. However if you are ending dinner with a 
sweet wine, a Chateau d'Yqem, for example, one bottle should 
be ample. 

Though it is sometimes convenient to serve one large and one 
half-size bottle, you will notice that the smaller bottles lack 
some of the fine qualities of the larger ones. 

Try to gage the amount required for your dinner with rather 
nice exactitude, especially in the case of Champagne. Once 
iced, then warmed and re-iced at a later date, Champagne is 
nearly ruined, and other wines suffer to a lesser degree. 

It may be pertinent to add that the larger the group of guests 
the more each one tends to consume. 

Temperature — Broadly speaking, all red wines should be 
served at room temperature and all white wines chilled. The 
change in temperature from that of the storage space should be 



WINE SEASONS FINE FOOD 741 

accomplished gradually, as sudden chilling or warming harms 
all wine. 

Red wines should never be drunk cold. Fine red Bordeaux 
and Burgundies have scarcely any bouquet at a temperature that 
chills the hands. Red Bordeaux, or claret, is best at a tempera- 
ture of 70° -7 5° F., approximately room temperature. If you 
keep your wines in a cool storage place — 5 5 ° F. is ideal for stor- 
ing — bring the claret to the dining room several hours before 
service time so that it may warm gradually. Never insert the 
bottle in hot water or put it near heat to hasten this process. 
Red Burgundy may be served slightly cooler than the other red 
wines. It loses its numbness speedily after it is poured into the 
glasses and by holding the bowl of the glass in the palm of the 
hand, to warm it further, the guest savors its expanding bouquet 
before tasting it. 

Beaujolais, Arbois, Chinon and a few other red wines, with 
much bouquet and little body, are best drunk cool ; they are ex- 
ceptions to the general rule. 

White wines should be drunk cool or chilled. The sweeter the 
wine, the longer it takes to chill it. Dry white wines cool 
quickly and a dry champagne quickest of all. On the other 
hand, a sweet sauterne takes a couple of hours in a mechanical 
refrigerator to reach its ideal temperature of 40° F. A half 
hour to an hour is ample refrigeration storage tO' cool white Bur- 
gundies, Rhone wines and the like. 

All sweet white wines, all sparkling wines and some dry wines 
should be thoroughly chilled. They should approximate 40° F. 
This chilling is best accomplished by the use of an ice bucket, 
at least when the wine reaches the table. The first cooling may be 
done by laying the bottles, horizontally, of course, in the me- 
chanical refrigerator. But wines, once iced, lose their grandeur 
if slightly warmed, and if they are allowed to stand outside a 
casing of ice for even ten minutes, the result may be disastrous. 
You can hasten even icing by turning your bottle in the ice 
bucket, which should be deep enough so that the entire bottle, 
except the very top, may be surrounded by ice. 

Beer should be kept in a cool place so that it may be made 
icy cold quickly when needed. However, it should not be stored 
permanently in the refrigerator. 

Uncorking and Decanting — Careful uncorking is impor- 
tant. One least bit of cork dropped into the bottle will ruin 



742 

great wines and can be detected in every case by the discerning 
palate. 

A lever type corkscrew is ideal; its edges should be rounded 
so that it will not cut the cork. Insert it evenly, straight and 
to the full depth of the cork. Then withdraw it very slowly so 
that your wine will remain still. This prevents the mixing of 
any sediment in the bottom of the bottle with the clear liquid. 

Note the condition of the cork. It should be long, moist and 
tightly inserted in the bottle. Short corks are an indication of 
slip-shod bottling, and dry corks, of poor after care (probably 
the bottle has been stored in an upright position) . If the cork 
smells acid, the wine itself is turned and no longer in good 
drinking condition. 

In recorking, it is usually advisable to cut off a little from the 
upper part of the cork (this obviates any taste of sealing ma- 
terials) and insert this top end in your bottle. The moist end 
expands rapidly on exposure to air and can seldom be reinserted. 

Decanting is the gentle transfer of wine from its bottle to a 
decanter. No two experts agree as to the advisability of doing 
this. However, there is no gainsaying the fact that old red wine 
with considerable sediment must be poured from the bottle by 
a very expert hand, or be decanted to prevent any sediment from 
reaching the wine glass. The simplest methods of decanting are 
to pour the wine slowly into a glass decanter and stop as soon 
as any sediment appears, or to pour the wine through a funnel 
topped with a thin layer of absorbent, not medicated, cotton. 
Decanting should be done just before the meal is served. 

Fine white wines are seldom decanted. However, both white 
and red wines of the ordinary day-by-day sorts are often served 
from a handsome glass decanter. This fashion originated in 
Europe because wines of this grade are often bought in bulk. 
A decanter of white wine and another of red are frequently 
placed on the dinner table. It is a great convenience to own 
several sizes. Ordinary red wines will keep for a considerable 
period if the decanters are airtight. As you drink your wine, 
change it to a smaller decanter ; the ideal is to have the wine and 
the stopper of the decanter meet each other. Liqueurs with high 
alcoholic content keep in partially filled decanters or bottles. 

Sherry, Madeira, Port and Claret are served from the bottle 
or from a decanter with equal correctness.

Care of Wine — ^Wine should be kept at an even temperature 
and in a dark, dry place with some ventilation but no drafts. 
A closet equipped with metal bins is the best solution in city- 
apartments. A cellar is, of course, ideal. Storing vegetables or 
other foods in such a cellar is unwise for they impart a disagree- 
able odor to wines even though they are bottled. 

Fortified wines and brandy may stand upright. Keep all your 
other unopened wines in a horizontal position when stored. 
Upright bottles of natural wines spoil in a few days, because of 
the shrinkage of the corks. Do not disturb your wines by un- 
necessary movement, for if there are any dregs or sediment 
movement tends to cloud the entire bottle. 

The ideal temperature for storing wines is about 55° F, Even 
temperature is important, for sudden changes ruin fine wines. 

Glasses — Sets of glassware make so charming a table decora- 
tion that most women will find it convenient to buy water 
goblets, glasses for red wines, and small ones for white wines 
and sherry in a single pattern. Champagne glasses should match 
the other glasses, for those who plan that luxury. Liqueur and 
cocktail glasses may diflFer, for they seldom appear at the same 
time as the other glassware. So select gay bits of contrast for 
these special services. 

In choosing wine glasses, buy rather large ones and fill them 
partially; one-half to three-quarters is suggested. Since color 
is one of the great fascinations of fine wine, connoisseurs approve 
clear crystal glassware with sparse decoration. A ball or tulip 
shaped bowl atop a long stem conserves the aroma and permits 
swirling. By holding the stem between the thumb and fore- 
finger, the guest may move his glass so that the wine picks up a 
slight motion and licks the sides of the glass. This swirling ex- 
hibits the fine texture of your wine and gathers its bouquet so 
that, when the glass is lifted to the mouth, the nose also gains 
full pleasure from the rich, fruity aroma. Dry wine spreads like 
water, and sweet wine hangs and makes runnels. A Bordeaux 
that does this is called "a fat one." 

The glory of Champagne, its sparkling quality, is best con- 
served by serving it in a glass with a fluted top on a hollow stem. 
The effervescence has a longer road to travel before it is dissi- 
pated in the atmosphere. 

A set of tall glasses suitable for beer, ale, juleps and lemonade 



744^ 

may match your water goblets or differ in pattern. Steins for 
beer are preferred by some hosts. 

Wine in Cookery — ^Wine is friendly to many foods but is 
equally antagonistic to other favorites. Egg is the outstanding 
example of the latter and cheese of the former. White and shell 
fish, poultry, game and meat, except pork, take on added luster 
by the addition of a small quantity of wine. Mushrooms, truf- 
fles and sweet potatoes complement wine flavors. Beware, be- 
ware, the combining of wine with acids in the form of gherkins, 
vinegar and similar condiments. 

For fish or meat sauces, dry wines are the dicta of most ex- 
perts. Riesling and Chablis are typical dry white wines, and 
claret is a typical dry red one. In the case of fish, the wine must 
be white, always, for red wine and fish do not mix. Meats may 
be cooked with either red or white wine. Occasionally a dash of 
a sweet cordial added at the last moment improves a meat. For 
instance, a tablespoon of Benedictine works magic in a pot roast. 

Desserts and fruits combine to best advantage with sweet 
white wines, fortified wines, sweet liqueurs or a little brandy. 

The amount of wine used in cookery is surprisin^y small. 
To benefit by this trifling quantity, the flavor must permeate 
each morsel of food. Several methods aid the cook to this end. 
**To marinate" the food in the wine, for an hour or so, is suitable 
to some recipes. "To burn" is the easy means to benefit from a 
small amount of brandy; simply pour the brandy over the food, 
touch it with a lighted match and shake the food until the 
flame dies out. To cook the food with wine for a considerable 
period of time is the third and usual method. 

Remember, however, that wine should never cook at a high 
temperature. A dozen bubbles spell disaster. This is especially 
true in the case of dishes that combine cream and wine. They 
should be cooked over hot water to prevent curdling. Another 
trick is to heat the fish or meat with the wine and add the cream 
or cream-egg mixture just before serving. If the amount of 
cream is large, heat it separately so that it will not chill the hot 
mixture. Do not heat eggs for sauces; merely add after the 
sauce is removed from the fire, for the heat of the cooked food 
will coagulate the egg. 

When browning the top of a platter filled with a wine sauce 
and fish combination — sole or lobster, for example — ^place it as 
close to the flame as possible and leave only a second or two. 



WINE SEASONS FINE FOOD 745 

Never keep it in the broiler long enough to raise the temperature 
of the entire sauce. In olden days, a red hot poker seared the 
top — a nearly perfect method. 

Never allow the aroma of your wine to escape and be squan- 
dered on the air. This bouquet should be part of the food. So 
cover your cooking utensils closely; cooking parchments may be 
used. Likewise, desserts should be closely covered while they 
chill in the refrigerator. 

Taste your foods as you assemble and cook them. The requi- 
site amount of salt and of wine will vary because of the differ- 
ences in the wines themselves. Some sorts — sherry is one — run 
the gamut from quite sweet to very dry and from a rich, heavy, 
tawny quality to a light, flavorsome one. 

Remember in your tasting adventures that, in the finest cook- 
ing, the wine flavor does not dominate; it merely accents and 
adds subtlety to the basic food flavor. 

Remember, too, that all punches, with or without wine, 
should stand for thirty minutes or more after they are mixed. 
This is called the ripening process. Ice is added at the time of 
service. 



COURT BOUILLON 

1 Yz cups boiling water 1 bay leaf 

Yz cup white wine (dry) 6 peppercorns 

y^ teaspoon salt Y^ teaspoon thyme 

2 slices garlic 6 slices carrot 
2 small onions 3 sprigs parsley 

Cook together for 30 minutes at simmering temperature. 
Strain and use as a substitute for water in poaching fish. If the 
recipe calls for a sauce, use this bouillon for its base. Any fish is 
improved by the added flavor-giving qualities of a court bouil- 
lon. Be sure to poach, not boil, your fish. 



CHILLED TROUT 

Try poaching brook trout in two tablespoons of butter and 
a half cup of court bouillon or of white wine. Turn once and 



746 

cook a very short time. Lift out, chill and serve with tartar 
sauce. It may be covered with an aspic gelatin and garnished 
with shrimps and bits of truffle. 

JELLIED CONSOMME WITH SHERRY 

3 cups seasoned consomme 4 tablespoons sherry wine 

2 tablespoons gelatin 54 cup cold water 

Yz teaspoon lemon juice Minced parsley 

Soften the gelatin in the cold water. Dissolve in the hot con- 
somme. Add the lemon juice and wine, and salt if required. 
Chill in the refrigerator. Chop lightly before putting in service 
cups. Top with minced parsley, a lemon crescent or a bit of 
tx)mato fringed with minced green pepper. 

HALIBUT A LA NEWBURG 

1 lb. halibut 1 cup evaporated milk (un- 

1 tablespoon brandy diluted) 

y^ cup sherry wine 1 teaspoon lemon juice 

2 tablespoons butter 3 t%% yolks 

Dash cayenne — salt to taste 

Cut the halibut in small cubes. Steam over hot water or poach 
in court bouillon for five minutes. Beware of long or swift cook- 
ing as the halibut easily loses its shape. When poached, put the 
fish, butter, wine, brandy, salt and cayenne in a double boiler 
and heat smoking hot. Beat the yolks and combine with the 
evaporated milk (sour cream may be substituted for the milk 
and lemon juice) and cook with the hot fish for one minute. 
Remove from the fire and add the lemon juice. Serve on very 
hot plates. An excellent chafing dish innovation. 

LOBSTER CURRY APPETIZER 

Yz cup fresh or canned lob- y^ teaspoon curry powder 

ster meat 1 teaspoon sherry wine 

2 tablespoons butter % teaspoon dry mustard 

Saute the lobster in the melted fat. Add the seasonings and 
the wine. When very hot serve on small bread croustades or 
packaged appetizer shells.

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG 

Yz lb. butter 3 cups lobster meat (3^^ lb. 

1 cup Madeira wine live lobster) 

2 cups whipping cream Salt and cayenne to taste 
1 small can tru£Qes 

Cut the lobster in small pieces. Chop the truffles fine. Heat 
both the above in melted butter till very hot. Add the wine. 
When hot add the cream and seasoning and let them blend for 
several minutes. Cook over hot water, as a high temperature 
will curdle the cream-wine mixture. 



SOLE THERMIDOR 

1 lb. sole or filet of flounder ^ cup brandy 

1 tablespoon flour 3 tablespoons butter 

Yz cup sour cream 2 cups court bouillon 

1 teaspoon dry mustard 4 tablespoons grated Swiss 

Salt and cayenne to taste or Parmesan cheese 

Neatly trim the fish fillets and poach in court bouillon. 
(See page 745.) Lift onto a hot baking platter. Combine tiie 
flour and melted butter and add the court bouillon in which the 
fish was poached. Add the seasonings, the cream, the brandy 
and 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Do not cook. Pour over the 
fish, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and put close under the 
flame to brown instantly. Serve as an entree. 

HAM PORTE MAILLOT 

54 cup cooking fat Yi clove garlic 

1^ cup dried Lima beans Y2 cup cauliflower 

(cooked) Ya cup celery 

54 cup carrots 2 leaves lettuce 

Ya cup onion Y^ ^^ Va cup dry white wine 

Originated by a restaurant just outside the Porte Maillot, one 
of the gates of Paris, this dish brings a new flavor to a baked 
ham. We have substituted dried Lima beans for the French 
white bean that is infrequently used in America. Cut the car- 
rots, onion, garlic, celery, cauliflower and lettuce in long nar- 
row shreds. Simmer them in the cooking fat but do not brown. 



748 

When cooked add the previously cooked Lima beans and the 
white wine. Cook together one minute and serve around a hot 
baked ham or as a sauce for left-over ham that has been re- 
heated over steam. 



VEAL WITH OLIVES 

1 V2 lbs. veal cutlets J^ cup butter or cooking fat 

J/3 cup Marsala wine 10 green olives 

Salt and pepper to taste 

The secret of the success of this delicious Italian meat is to 
have the veal pounded paper thin. Ask for veal scaloppini at 
markets in the East. Otherwise ask for veal cutlets and ask 
the butcher to pound the meat paper thin after cutting it 
J4 inch thick. Wipe the veal, sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Simmer very quickly in the melted butter, browning lightly on 
both sides, add the wine and the olives cut in narrow strips. 
Heat one minute and serve. The veal should cook in ^yt 
minutes. 



BURGUNDIAN BEEF 



3 lbs. beef, rump or round 2 tablespoons butter 

54 lb. salt pork 3 tablespoons flour 

3 cups minced onion J4 carrot, in circles 

2 small shallots, minced 1 clove garlic 

6 peppercorns 2 tablespoons minced parsley 

2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons minced chervil 

1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar 154 to 2 cups red wine 

or fresh minced tarragon Salt to taste 
% teaspoon thyme 

Dice the salt pork, and saute in the butter. Cut the beef in 
two-inch cubes or leave in one piece as preferred. Sear thor- 
oughly in the hot fat. Lift out. Add the onion, garlic, shallots 
and carrot. Simmer them in the fat till light yellow. Add all 
the other ingredients and the beef. Cook on a very slow fire 
three hours. Remove excess fat and serve. It may be re-heated 
with advantage.

LAMB CHOPS WITH MADEIRA 

6 lamb chops 2 carrots 

3 onions 4 mushrooms 

2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons Madeira 

1 teaspoon tomato paste Yg teaspoon pepper 

Yz clove garlic Yz teaspoon salt 

Cut the vegetables in fine inch-length strips. Simmer them 
in the butter till tender. Cover during this cooking so that the 
zest will be preserved. Season. Add the tomato paste and 
Madeira. Serve on top of broiled lamb chops. Thick lamb 
chops boned and circled with bacon add elegance to this 
Madeira flavored dish. 



CHICKEN BRAISED WITH WINE 

(Coq au Vin) 

1 frying chicken 3 tablespoons butter 

8 small white onions Y4 lb. salt pork diced 

4 small shallots Y4 lt>- mushrooms 

1 tablespoon minced parsley 1 bay leaf 

1 tablespoon minced chervil 1 carrot 

2 tablespoons flour Pinch thyme 

1 tablespoon brandy 1 cup red or white wine 

Salt and pepper to taste 1 clove garlic 

Lightly brown the salt pork in the melted butter, add the 
shallot, onions, garlic and the carrot cut in circles. Simmer till 
golden, but not browned. . Lift out and brown the chicken. 
Sprinkle with the flour, seasoning and herbs. Return the 
sauteed vegetables and add the wine. Cook fifteen to twenty 
minutes on a rather hot fire. During the last £vq minutes add 
the mushrooms. Skim off excess fat and serve. 

Red wine is usual in making this dish, but the white one 
gives a more delicate flavor. 

Make your dinner perfect by serving with this chicken a 
salad of mixed greens with a simple French dressing made with 
lemon juice. The acid of vinegar devitalizes the subtle details 
in flavor of the wine-cooked chicken.

Melt the butter and cook onions in it for five minutes. Do 
not brown. Add the mushrooms that have been washed but not 
peeled. Whole mushrooms make the most attractive service, so 
slice only the stems. When well coated with butter, add the 
minced herbs, the flour, the bouillon and the seasoning. Cook 
until the onions are tender — slowly of course. Add the Madeira

^ cup flour 6 lumps loaf sugar 

2 teaspoons sugar 1 orange 

1 teaspoon salt 6 tablespoons brandy 

^ cup milk 54 cup Grand Marnier Liqueur 

3 eggs Ys lb. sweet butter 

This very famous but really very simple dessert is not dif- 
ficult. A more awe-inspiring recipe for the crepes is common at 



WINE SEASONS FINE FOOD 755 

many great Parisian restaurants, but this is excellent and simple. 
The successful making of crepes depends on the thinness of the 
batter. 

Add sugar and salt to the eggs, beaten slightly, then alter- 
nately the flour and the milk and then beat thoroughly with a 
rotary beater. Lightly grease a small frying pan (7 inches) and 
pour in about two tablespoons of batter. Move the pan so that 
the batter spreads to the outer edge of the pan. Brown on both 
sides and roll. Keep in a warm place until ready to serve. 

The Suzette sauce is made by rubbing the lump sugar with 
the white part of the orange peel, adding one teaspoon of very 
finely minced outer peel and dissolving the sugar in one table- 
spoon brandy. Combine with one-eighth of a pound of sweet 
butter. At service time, in the chafing dish, or Suzette pan pref-

FROZEN PUDDING WITH RUM 

2 eggs 1 cup assorted candied fruit 

1 cup sugar 2^ cups milk 

54 to ^ cup rum 1 cup whipping cream 
Pinch salt 

Cover the chopped candied fruits with rum and cover tightly. 
Stand two or three hours. Make a custard of the eggs, sugar, 
salt and hot milk. Cool. Fold in the whipping cream, beaten 
stiff, and the candied fruits. Pour into a tray of the mechanical 
refrigerator and freeze. Beat at the end of an hour and once 
or twice afterward to assure even textured cream. At the last 
beating, the cream may be placed in small molds or in little in- 
dividual paper containers. 

PINEAPPLE WITH KIRSCH 

Cut a ripe pineapple in slices. Remove the rind and the eyes. 
Restack the slices in their original shape. Pass with the pine- 
apple a bowl of powdered sugar and a bottle of kirsch. 

Canned pineapple is also excellent with kirsch but, when 
using it, you gain in flavor by pouring the kirsch over the fruit 
and chilling in the refrigerator for an hour or more. Be sure to 
cover closely so that all the zest will be part of the fruit. Allow 
one tablespoon of kirsch to two slices of canned pineapple. 

Many other fruits are delicious accompanied by this mild 
liqueur, strawberries, for example. 



SYLLABUB 

2 cups whipping cream i^ cup powdered sugar 

1 tablespoon rum 

A famous English recipe. Whip the cream stiflf, fold in the 
sugar and rum. Ripen in the refrigerator for half an hour, 
covered, of course. Serve in sherbet glasses.

with powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons rum. Chill 3 minutes. 

Whisk two egg whites stiff, beat in gradually 4 tablespoons 
powdered sugar. Fold in the chilled berries. Serve in sherbet 
glasses and top with sweetened whipped cream. 

TIPSY PUDDING 

One of the choice recipes of our Grandmother's era. It ap- 
peared in the place of honor on New Year's Day. The secret for 
a successful outcome is to use a very stale, very porous cake. 
A broken, not cut, sunshine cake at least four days old, should 
be soaked in sherry. Allow about one cup sherry to a quarter of 
a good sized cake. An hour later cover the cake with a soft 
custard flavored with rum. Serve very cold. 

OLD FASHIONED WINE JELLY 

2 tablespoons granulated V2 <=^P ^^^^ ^^^^^ 

gelatin 1 cup boiling water 

1 cup sherry or Madeira wine Grated rind 1 orange 

1 cup sugar ^ |^ cup lemon juice 
Yi cup orange juice 

Soak the gelatin in the cold water until soft. Dissolve in the 
boiling water, add the sugar and other ingredients. Pour into 
molds that have been rinsed in cold water. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

BRANDIED PEACHES 

4 lbs. fruit 4 lbs. sugar 

1 pint best white brandy 1 egg white 

Cloves 3 Yz cups water 

Pare the peaches with a silver knife. Insert 2 cloves in each 
whole peach. Make a syrup of the sugar and water. Add the 
egg white beaten to a froth. Skim. Put in fruit, one layer at 
a time, and boil five minutes or until it may be pierced with a 
straw. Remove the fruit to a platter to partially cool. Then 



75^ 

pack in glass jars. Return any excess juice to the syrup and boil 
about ten minutes more, or till well thickened. Remove from 
the fire, add the brandy and pour over the fruit. Seal at once. 
White cling stone peaches are particularly good. Six pounds of 
fruit will yield about seven pint jars. Improves with age. 

HASTY WINE GELATIN 

2 packages lemon-flavored Yz cup Madeira wine or 
gelatin Y^ cup sherry wine 

3 J/2 cups hot water 

Dissolve the gelatin in the hot water. When perfectly clear 
add the wine. Pour in molds that have been rinsed in cold 
water. Serve with whipped cream. Garnish with grated orange 
peel on top the whipped cream. Orange flavored gelatin com- 
bines well with Madeira. 



CLARET LEMONADE 

12 cubes ice Sugar syrup to taste 

1 bottle claret Orange slices 

Juice 3 lemons 

Half fill a glass pitcher with ice cubes or cracked ice. Add the 
lemon juice and a few slices of orange. Fill the pitcher nearly 
full with claret and add sugar syrup to taste. Stand twenty to 
thirty minutes to blend and ripen. 

MULLED CLARET 

1 qt. hot claret ^ cup sugar 

1 piece stick cinnamon 8 cloves 

Juice 1 lemon Y^ lemon sliced 

Heat the claret and add the other ingredients. Stir till dis- 
solved and serve hot. Doughnuts were served with it in the 
nineties. 

TUTTI FRUTTI 

Into a stone jar put one cup of brandy, the best you own, one 
cup sugar and one cup ripe strawberries. Stir thoroughly. As 
each fruit comes to the height of its perfection, add it, with a 



WINE SEASONS FINE FOOD 



757 



cup of sugar for each cup of fruit. No more brandy is indicated. 
Be sure to stir at each addition. Large fruits like peaches should 
be cut in small pieces. Cherries and plums should be stoned. 
Atop vanilla ice cream this is an epicurean delight. Perhaps you 
will make enough to use it for preserves. 

CHAMPAGNE CUP 

1/^ cup Maraschino 2 qts. Champagne 

y2 cup Vermuth Cucumber rind 

^2 cup Santa Cruz rum Juice 4 oranges 

Sugar to taste Juice 3 lemons 

Sweeten the fruit juices slightly. Combine all the ingredients. 
Let stand ten minutes after mixing with a large piece of ice in 
a punch bowl. It's well to use as large a piece of ice as possible, 
for it melts more slowly and adds less water to the punch. 

EGGNOG, SOUTHERN 

4 eggs 4 tablespoons brandy or 

3^ cup whipping cream whisky 

3 tablespoons powdered sugar 

Beat the yolks till thick and lemon colored. Slowly beat in the 
brandy and sugar. Fold in the stiffly beaten whites and the
