EXPLANATION 



XN this edition of the book it is aimed to feature cookery 
of Hawaiian food products. 
Because there are now so many reliable cookbooks containing 
full lists of reqjpes, these are obviously omitted here, and for the 
same reason some recipes formerly contained here are eliminated. 
Hearty acknowledgment is hereby made for the expert assist- 
ance of Mrs. James Russell, past-mistress in the knowledge and 
use of Hawaiian food products.

soups 

STOCK FOR ALL KINDS OF SOUP.— Mrs. C. D. Miller. 

Take a good sized shin of beef, cut every particle from the 
bone and cut up into inch pieces ; cut or saw the bone into 
pieces as small as convenient and put the whole in a sauce 
pan, cover with cold water and set it aside in a cool place for 
half an hour, or even an hour. This will drain out much of 
the juice of the meat. The bones from roast beef, steak, etc^ 
are good to add to the stock kettle. Set this on the stove and 
let it come to a boil, then remove to the back of the stove and 
keep it simmering all day if convenient, several hours at any 
rate. The next morning remove all the fat. This is a good 
stock for soups, hashes or stews. To make soup, take out the 
required quantity, add vegetables, macaroni, tomatoes, accord- 
ing to fancy. Pea flour soup is delicious made from this stock ; 
onion is an improvement to the soup in moderate quantity. 
Whenever stock is taken out of the kettle or jar, add water 
and let it boil. Chicken bones, scraps of meat, mutton bones, 
can be added, but never any vegetables. It is well to heat 
the stock often to the boiling point. (This recipe comes from 
an excellent housekeeper who lives in the country, where fresh 
meat is only obtainable once a week. It is therefore thoroughly 
reliable. — Ed.) 



POTATO SOUP.— Mrs. Parke. 

Boil together six good sized potatoes and two onions in water 
to cover. Mash down together, add one large tablespoon of 
butter and season with salt, pepper and a little celery salt. 
Boil three pints of milk and add to the other ingredients. Mix 
thoroughly and strain through a fine strainer. Re-heat and 



4 

serve with crackers. Chopped parsley may be added just before 
serving. 



CLEAR SOUP.— (Brown.)— Mrs. Parke. 

Three pounds lean beef cut up in strips put with three 
quarts of cold water. Boil slowly, but steadily for two hours, 
keeping the soup-kettle covered. Slice 3 onions and fry in 
butter till of a light brown color. Put them into the soup-pot, 
also a small teaspoonful of cloves, half as much pepper, a 
little mace, pinch of allspice, teaspoonful essence of celery, or 
celery salt (use fresh celery also if it can be had), a little sum- 
mer savory of sweet marjoram, tied together loosely in a 
cheese cloth, teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Salt to taste. Con- 
tinue to stew all these together for 3 hours more, or till the 
beef is cooked to pieces, then strain and serve. 



TOMATO SOUP.— Mrs. W. W. Hall. 

One quart of canned tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes stewed), 
one tablespoonful of butter mixed with two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one teaspoonful salt mixed with tomatoes, and boil the mix- 
ture. When this is hot, stir in, little by little, a teaspoonful of 
soda. This will cause violent effervescence. When the mixture 
is quiet add a quart of hot milk, strain and serve at once. It is 
well to put the tomatoes in a large container to allow for the 
action of the soda. 



TOMATO BISQUE.— Mrs. J. O. Carter. 

One quart of tomatoes, 1 carrot and 1 onion stewed together 
till soft enough to rub through a colander, season with salt 
and pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar, 1 of Worcestershire 
sauce, butter the size of an tgg. Add about a quart of water 
and boil 20 minutes, thickening with flour. 



FRESH CORN SOUP.— Mrs. Bray. 

Cut, or grate carefully, the corn from one dozen ears. Put 
the cobs into a kettle with 1 quart of water and boil 20 minutes. 



Remove the cobs and add to the water the corn and 1 quart 
of milk, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove from the fire,' 
season with salt and pepper to taste ; also a large piece of 
butter; stir in 2 well beaten eggs. 



WHITE SWISS SOUP.— Mrs. Bray. 

A quart of mutton broth; when it boils add the following 
mixture : Two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed in a little water 
till smooth, a coffee-cup of milk, a small pinch of cayenne 
pepper, nutmeg, 1 beaten egg should be stirred in the soup 
until it boils up. Serve in a hot tureen immediately. 



SAGO SOUP.— Mrs. H. W. Schmidt. 

Boil y 2 cup of sago in about 2 quarts of water. A quarter 
of an hour before serving add y 2 cup raisins, a few pieces 
stick cinnamon and sugar to taste. Just before serving add a 
cup of fruit syrup. 



MULLIGATAWNY SOUP.— (Indian receipt.)— 

Mrs. F. W. Damon. 

One fowl sliced, or rabbit, 4 onions, 6 cloves, 2 tablespoonfuls 
butter. When the butter is melted, and meat and onions 
browned, add 2 tablespoonfuls of curry paste, or 3 of fresh curry 
spices, and 1 teaspoon salt. Stew for 45 minutes, stirring 
occasionally, then add 3 pints of broth, and simmer for twenty 
minutes. Thicken before serving. Add lime juice at pleasure. 



CREAM OF ONION SOUP. 

Peel and slice one dozen small white onions, then fry to a 
light brown in one tablespoonful of butter, add two tablespoons 
of flour and one quart of boiling water, season to taste, and 
add one-half teaspoon of sugar, and a pinch of mace. Cook 
gently for half an hour, strain and add one pint of rich milk, 



and one cupful of cream, and three hard boiled eggs chopped 
fine and serve at once. 



CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

Boil one cupful of rice in three pints of milk until cooked 
enough to pass through a seive. Grate four heads of Hawaiian 
celery and add to the rice and milk, season with salt, pepper and 
two tablespoons of butter, and boil gently until celery is tender. 



GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Wash one quart of peas, shell them, boil the pods in three 
pints of water with a little salt until soft. Rub through a 
seive. Stir the pulp into the water, in which the pods were 
boiled. Add one head of lettuce chopped fine and the peas. 
Boil together for thirty minutes. Melt two tablespoons of 
butter in another pan, stir in two tablespoons of flour, salt 
and pepper. Pour the other mixture on and stir till it thickens. 
Serve with small squares of toasted bread. 



VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Ten cents soup bone, 3 pints water, 10 cents soup vegetables, 
2 tablespoons of salt, y 2 cup Pearl barley, 1 lump of sugar. 

Wash the soup bone and see there are rio small splinters of 
bone to come loose. Put into the water, add the salt and boil up. 
Skim carefully and add the barley. Tilt the cover and turn 
fire low. Wash and cut up all the vegetables into neat dice. 
There should be in the bunch Hawaiian celery, parsley, green 
onions, two carrots and two turnips, two or three small tomatoes 
Leave tomatoes till last, put others in a strainer and pour a little 
boiling water over them, and rinse under the tap. Add to the 
soup when it has been simmering for one hour. Cut up tomatoes, 
and add with one cube of sugar, cook 30 minutes and serve.

HOW TO COOK FISH 

TO BAKE 

Clean the fish, remove its eyes, slit open from the vent, and 
dry with a cloth. Mix thoroughly and place in the vent 1 c. 
soft bread crumbs, 2 T. melted butter substitute, 1 t. chopped 
parsley, y 2 t. finely chopped lemon peel, salt and pepper. Sew 
up, pull fish in form of letter S, place in greased baking pan, 
and put a little grease on top. Bake 20 minutes to the pound 
in moderate oven, basting every 5 to 6 minutes. Place on 
hot dish, remove strings, and serve with brown gravy. 



STUFFING FOR BAKED FISH. 

Fry one T. of chopped onion in a T. of butter substitute. Add 
a c. or more of stale bread, which has been soaked in hot water, 
then pressed dry. Add a T. each of chopped parsley, suet, and 
celery, % T. of salt, and pepper. When it is well mixed, remove 
from the fire and add an egg. 

To make a change in the above dressing, add a tomato and a 
large chili pepper. 



TO BAKE. 

Any white fish is delicious prepared in this way : Cut in two- 
inch squares ; sprinkle a pan with flour, salt and pepper ; lay 
the fish in this ; sprinkle again with salt, pepper, a pinch of 
thyme, and one bay leaf. Pour over this 1 pt. stewed tomatoes, 
1 sliced lemon, a few bits of butter substitute, and let cook in 
a hot oven 20 minutes. 



TO BOIL. 

Place in dish sufficient water to cover the fish entirely; also 
1 T. salt and a slice of lemon 1 inch thick. When water boils, 



11 

drop in fish and cook, allowing 20 minutes for each pound, and 
if fish weighs 6 pounds or more, allowing an additional 20 
minutes. When done, drain, and serve very hot with any good 
fish sauce. 



TO BROIL. 

Clean the fish and dry with a cloth. Rub with a piece of 
lemon, dot with butter substitute with salt and pepper, and 
broil quickly for 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn, dot with butter 
substitute, and repeat broiling until done. 



TO FRY. 

To Fry in Deep Fat : Clean the fish, remove skin and bones, 
and dry with a cloth. On a paper have ready mixture of 1 T. 
flour, 1 t. salt, y 2 t. pepper. On another paper have some bread 
crumbs, and in a bowl a well-beaten tgg. Dip fish first in 
flour, then in egg f then in bread crumbs. Have fat at least 
three inches deep in pan. When it smokes from the center, drop 
in the fish and fry until bijown. Then remove quickly and dry 
on crumpled paper. Serve while hot. Fat may be used re- 
peatedly if it is strained and not allowed to burn. 

To Fry in Steaks: Cut fish into steaks; dry; dip into flour, 
salt and pepper, and place at once in pan containing 3 T. of oil. 
Fry solwly, and turn. Serve with sliced lemon and parsley. 



TO STEAM. 

Clean the fish and dry with a cloth. Cover with salt and 
pepper, and wrap up in a thick piece of paper oiled in the 
center as you would wrap up a parcel. Cook in a steamer, 
allowing 30 minutes to the pound. Remove paper, and serve 
on a hot dish with a separate sauce or gravy. If a steamer is 
not available, take an ordinary covered pan, and place in it an 
inverted fire-proof dish. See that depth of water is only half 
the height of dish, and proceed as with steamer.

liquid for basting ; if not, add very little water. 

Serve with brown sauce ; garnish with lemon and parsley or 
watercress. 



Aku (Portuguese Style) 

Dice the fish, and cover with vinegar. Add a large onion 
(sliced), 2 pieces garlic (mashed), salt, and let stand 6 hours. 
Then fry in hot fat.

Salt them, pour into the stomach and gills cocoanut juice 
secured by grating and squeezing the pulp of a cocoanut ; tie 
up in the ti-leaves and bake in the oven or broil on the coals 
outdoors. The latter method is preferable, for the juices do 
not dry away so much as in an oven, and the leaves do not 
stick to the fish, as they often do in the former case. 



23 

Moi or Mullet Special 

Put 3 fish in saucepan, almost cover with water, add salt, and

the seeds), upon each piece, and sprinkle with salt. Add 3 or 
4 dots of savory fat, and cover it all with browned bread 
crumbs. Put just enough water in the pan to prevent the fish

2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch or flour, 2 tablespoonfuls butter, salt 
and pepper to taste. Boil the milk and add the butter, pepper, 
salt and cornstarch. Remove all bits of bone and skin from 
the salmon, drain off the fluid and mince fine. Put a thin layer 
of crumbs in the bottom of a pudding dish, then a layer of fish, 
then a layer of white sauce. Repeat these layers ending with the 



37 

crumbs. Bal^e till the top crumbs are a handsome brown. This 
is a delicious dish for breakfast or tea, and is served as a fish 
course for dinner. 



HOW TO COOK LOBSTER. 

Have ready a pan of boiling water deep enough to' cover the 
lobster. Drop it in alive, and cover closely. Cook for forty- 
five minutes. Cool and open the lobster. 



CODFISH BALLS.— Butterick's Cook Book. 

One quart of raw potatoes sliced, 1 large cup of salt codfish, 
1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, 2 tablespoons of butter, 
salt and pepper to taste. Boil fish and potatoes together in 
plenty of water until the potatoes are soft. Drain off the water, 
add cream, butter and seasoning and drop from a spoon into 
very hot fat. The mixture should be a moderately stiff batter. 
These fish balls are especially delicious. 



MEATS 



TO PREPARE COCOANUT JUICE FOR GRAVIES. 

Grate the cocoanut and add a very little fresh milk, and let 
it stand on the back of the stove for half an hour, then turn it 
into a clean cloth and wring the juice very dry. 



MOCK DUCK.— Mrs. John Wilder. 

Take a steak, a large one is best, though if you can tie them 
up, pieces will do, even if small. Take out the large bone, and 
pound the beef; make a dressing of bread that has been soaked 
in water and squeezed as dry as possible, 2 pieces of bacon 
fried and chopped fine, with 1 large onion, or a number of small 
ones, sage, summer savory, a little butter, and plenty of salt and 



38 

pepper. Make early in the morning — it is better* for standing. 
Cook it a little, stirring it all the time. Put the dressing in the 
steak, leaving out a little for the gravy. Tie it up tightly, beat 
an egg well, pour it all over the steak, put on 2 tablespoonfuls 
of butter in lumps, put it in a pan with water, but do not let 
the water touch it. Baste often. Cook about an hour. 

Gravy for above. 

Any cold meat gravy is nice with a little of the dressing, 
more onion, sage, savory, and a little bacon or cold beef minced 
very fine, and seasoned highly with salt and pepper. 



BEEFSTEAK PIE.— Mrs. C. D. Miller. 

Take about 2 pounds of steak, slice in pieces about seven inches 
long and %. inch thick; dredge each piece with flour, pepper 
and salt sparingly, add a pinch of celery salt, shred two medium 
sized onions and sprinkle each piece. Ball these strips firmly 
(some tie them as in beef olives), put them in a saucepan, cover 
with boiling water and place on the stove where it will simmer 
(not boil fiercely) for one hour. Place in the middle of a deep 
pie dish an inverted tea-cup and lay the beef rolls around it. 
Prepare this in the morning then set it in the safe. Strain the 
liquor and set it aside to cool, then remove the fat and heat the 
liquor; when near the boiling point stir in one dessert spoonful 
of butter rubbed with two of flour (rub it very smooth), add to 
the liquor and stir till it is smooth and creamy, then pour this 
over the beef in the pie dish and cover with the crust, making 
two incisions to allow the steam to escape. Chicken cut up and 
prepared in the same way is delicious. Use any good pie crust 
being sure to cut incision on top. 



RUTH PINCH'S BEEFSTEAK PUDDING.— Mrs. Kinney. 

Make into a firm smooth paste, 1 pound flour, 1 cup of suet 
chopped fine, a little salt with a little water. Line with this a 
basin which holds V/ 2 pints. Season and cut up a pound of 
tender steak, free from bone and skin, with an ounce of salt and 
^.teaspoonful of pepper. Lay it in the crust, pour in y A pint of 



39 

water, roll out the cover, close the pudding carefully, tie a 
floured cloth over it and boil for 2>y 2 hours. 



HAMBURG CAKES.— Mrs. W. D. Alexander. 

Chop a pound of round steak, add a grated minced onion, 1 
egg, 1 cup rolled crackers and seasoning. Make into balls and 
drop into a hot pan without grease. This keeps in the juice and 
prevents the meat from being greasy. 



BEEFSTEAK ROLLS.— Mrs. Kittredge. 

Cut thin slices of round steak, a little larger than a slice of 
baker's roll, as many slices of bread as of the steak. Butter 
the bread, stick in a few cloves and sprinkle with pepper and 
celery salt. Roll the slice of steak over into the bread with a 
firm roll and tie up well with a string. Dredge each roll with 
flour. Put in a saucepan a tablespoon of butter, and fry the 
rolls till quite brown in the butter. Then remove them to a 
stewpan and add enough water to cover them. Let them simmer 
slowly for a couple of hours. Serve with the gravy. These 
are nice the next day, cold, cut in slices, without the gravy. 



SPANISH FRICEO.— Miss Amelia Hoffman. 

This dish is made from good beef (the same kind as is used 
for beefsteaks), lean pork or young mutton. The best is beef 
and pork in equal quantities. Two pounds of meat is enough 
for six or eight persons. The meat is beaten till soft and then 
cut in thin slices. Cut raw potatoes in thin slices, washing them 
before they are cut, but not after, and take 2 soup plates of them. 
Mix with the potatoes 2 saucersful of onions cut in slices. Take 
a pudding dish and put meat and potatoes in layers. Scatter 
over each layer some pepper and some Jamaica pepper and salt ; 
put on every layer of potatoes a pieces of butter, and ^ table- 
spoonful of thick sour cream. Close the pudding dish well and 
put it in boiling water, and let it boil for V/ 2 hours. 



40 
TO COOK A CALF'S HEAD.— Mrs. W. F. Allen. 

Calf's head, 1 egg, spoonful of flour, a little grated nutmeg, 
3 tablespoonfuls of milk, some slices of bacon, a dozen force- 
meat balls, pepper, salt, mace, an onion, bunch of herbs, 8 mush- 
rooms, pint of gravy. Boil the head three-quarters of an hour; 
let it stand until cold, then slice. Boil the brain, in the cloth, 
chop fine and beat it up with the egg, flour, milk and nutmeg. 
Season the gravy with pepper, mace, cloves, herbs, onion and 
cayenne pepper. Let it simmer 10 minutes, strain, then add the 
mushrooms. Place the sliced head in this, and cook gently 15 
minutes. Serve in the center of the dish, with the brain fritters, 
bacon and force-meat balls round, and the egg sauce over the 
whole. The brain, when prepared, is to be fried like fritters. 



VEAL LOAF FOR LUNCHES.— Mrs. Atherton. 

Three pounds veal chopped fine with a small piece of salt pork, 
1 teacup rolled crackers, 1 cup milk, 1 egg ; season with salt and 
pepper. Bake \y 2 hours, and slice when cold. Bake in a deep 
dish. It is also nice when hot to turn out and serve with thick- 
ened milk. Made thinner with milk and fried like batter cakes, 
it makes a very nice breakfast dish. 



BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON. 

This recipe can be varied either by preparing the leg with 
a stuffing placed in the cavity after having the bone removed, 
or cooking it without. Having lined the bottom of a thick iron 
kettle or stew-pan with a few thin slices of bacon ; put over 
the bacon 4 carrots, 3 onions, a bunch of savory herbs; then 
over these place the leg of mutton. Cover the whole with a 
few more slices of bacon; then pour over half a pint of water.' 
Cover with a tight cover and stew very gently for 4 hours, 
basting the leg occasionally with its own liquor, and. seasoning 
it with salt and pepper as soon as it begins to be tender. When 
cooked, strain the gravy, thicken with a spoonful of flour (quite 
brown) ; pour some of it over the meat and send the remainder 
to the table in a tureen, to be served with the mutton when 



41 

carved. Garnish the dish around the leg with potatoes cut in the 
shape of olives and fried a light brown in butter. 



CANNED SHEEP'S TONGUE WITH TOMATO SAUCE.— 

Mrs. C. H. Judd. 
The skin having been removed from the tongues, fry them in 
butter until quite brown, then place on a platter. Pour into the 
frying pan y 2 a tin of canned tomatoes, or the same quantity of 
fresh ones peeled and chopped fine. To these add a little salt 
and pepper and y 2 a cup of boiling water. When thoroughly 
cooked, pour over the tongues and serve hot. 



COLD MEAT COOKERY

and shape it like croquettes. Roll in the bread crumbs, dip 
in beaten egg and again in crumbs, put in the frying basket 
and plunge into boiling fat. Cook 2 minutes, drain and serve. 
These can be cooked in hot lard in a frying pah. 



CALF'S HEAD CHEESE. 

Boil a calf's head in water enough to cover it, until the meat 
leaves the bones ; then take it with a skimmer into a wooden 



42 

bowl or tray; take from it every particle of bone; chop it 
small; season with pepper and salt, a heaping tablespoonful of 
salt and teaspoonful of pepper, sufficient ; if liked, add a table- 
spoonful of finely chopped sweet herbs; lay in a cloth in a 
colander, put the minced meat into it, then fold the cloth closely 
over it ; lay a plate over it, and put on it a gentle weight. When 
cold it may be sliced thin for supper or lunches. Spread each 
slice with made mustard. 



BAKED HAM.— Mrs. W. L. Whitney. 

Cut the rind from a slice of fat ham about four inches thick ; 
parboil quickly and throw off the water. Place the ham in a 
baking dish, sprinkle with one teaspoonful of sugar and a gen- 
erous amount of black pepper. Dredge thickly with flour, 
cover with one-half a can of tomatoes or slices of fresh ones ; 
dredge again with flour, sprinkle well with black pepper and 
bake for about three hours.

dip each slice into the butter, then into dry breadcrumbs. Put 
the slices in a baking dish, sprinkle salt and pepper and chopped 
pickles between. Pour on half a cup of vinegar from the 
pickles, and add one cupful of gravy or stock, cover and leave 
all day in a slow oven or the fireless cooker. 



A NICE REAKFAST DISH.— Mrs. Bray. 

Mix together one cup of cold cooked rice with one egg, three 
tablespoons of milk, salt and pepper. Line a baking dish with 



43 



this mixture, keeping some for the top. Chop up cold meat, 
season it, and cover with gravy ; place in the baking dish with 
rice on top, and brown in the oven. 



TOAD IN THE HOLE.— Mrs. C. D. Miller. 
Put half a pound of flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. 
beat into it one egg, and three-fourths of a pint of milk. Beat 
well, and pour into a baking dish, and drop balls of sausage 
or cold meat, or cold fish into the batter. Bake for half an 
hour. 



BEEF AND POTATO PIE.— Mrs. C. D. Miller. 
Take cold beef or mutton, pass it through a meat chopper, 
into a buttered baking dish, add seasoning, one grated onion, 
a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, enough gravy to moisten, 
mix together well. Have ready enough mashed potatoes to 
cover thickly, ornament with a fork, and brown in the oven. 



HAM AND TOAST.— Mrs. Charles Dillingham.

in hot fat. 



44 

GAME AND POULTRY 



In all of these recipes rabbit raised on the islands may be 
used with good results. 



HOW TO MAKE POULTRY OR MEAT TENDER 

The day before have the poultry cleaned and dressed. Take 
several large Papaia leaves, bruise them with the handle of a 
knife, wrap them around the fowl or meat with the underside 
next the meat, tie with string and cover with cheese-cloth. 
Keep in the ice-box till ready to cook. Leave no longer than 
twenty-four hours, six is enough for steak. 



STEWED CHICKEN WITH LUAU.— Mrs. A. Jaeger. 

Cut an old hen in small pieces, and put in a saucepan with 
cold water to cover. Cook gently for two hours, now add salt 
and turn fire low. Take one 5c bundle of Luau, and put in 
another saucepan of cold water, boil up quickly, and throw the 
water away. Add boiling water, and cook till tender. Strain 
and put in with the chicken. Boil together for ten minutes, then 
add the juice of one cocoanut, let it heat again but do not boil. 
Season to taste and serve. 



BOILED CHICKEN.— Mrs. James Pratt. 

Stuff the chicken, put it in a closely covered tin pail in a pot 
of boiling water; stew 2 hours or more; mix the gravy left in 
the pail with milk or cream, hard-boiled eggs chopped, a little 
parsley and the giblets previously boiled; add a teaspoonful 
of flour and salt. After boiling, pour some gravy over the 
chicken and put the Test in gravy boat and serve. 



STEWED CHICKEN.— Mrs. Atherton. 

Cut 4 or 5 slices of salt pork, put them in the stewpan and 
fry. Cut up the chicken, put it in and cook a few minutes with 



45 



the pork, then pour on a quart of hot water. Stew till the 
chicken is tender, then add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour salt a 
little mace and a cup of cream. Pour over slices of' toasted 
bread. 



JEWISH DISH.— Miss Teuira Henry. 
Take a chicken and fry it crisp in olive oil, sprinkling it with 
salt as in usual frying, and scattering into it some finely cut 
onion. Then turn the chicken into a saucepan and pour on 
boiling water, just enough to cover it; take the yolks of 2 hen 
eggs, mix them with a tablespoon of flour and water for thick- 
ening; squeeze in the juice of half a good lime, and add some 
pepper and more salt if needed. Add more or less lime also 
according to taste, and let it simmer gently on the fire until nice 
and tender. 



CHICKEN A LA MARINGO.— Mme. Boueilch. 
Cut up a very nice chicken and fry it in sweet oil with just 
a . sus P lcl on of garlic. Then chop some onion, another sus- 
picion of garlic, giblets and a few mushrooms, and fry all with 
the chicken a little while. Put in a piece of fresh lemon or 
hme peel; add soup stock or hot water, the juice of 2 limes 
some whole mushrooms, and cook till done. Throw the lemon 
peel away. After toasting some thin slices of bread, fry a 
golden brown in butter, lay them at the bottom of a dish and 
place the chicken on top with mushrooms around it. Add be- 
fore serving, or while cooking, a large spoonful of "cocoanut 
juice." 



CHICKEN OR TURKEY CROQUETTES. 

Chop the meat fine, chop half a middle-sized onion, fry with 
1 ounce butter, add half a teaspoonful flour, stir for half a 
minute, then add the chopped meat and a little over a gill of 
broth, salt, pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; stir 2 minutes, take 
from the fire, mix 2 yolks of eggs with it, put back on the fire 
for a minute, stirring the while. Lastly, add 4 mushrooms 
chopped, or 2 truffles, or both, according to taste. Turn 



46 

the mixture into a dish, and when cool enough set it on the ice 
for an hour or two. Then shape the croquettes, dip in beaten 
egg, roll in bread crumbs and again set on ice till it is time to 
cook them, then fry in hot fat. 



A GOOD CURRY SAUCE. 

1 tablespoon butter 1 cocoanut 

1 onion A small piece green ginger 

1 T. curry powder li/2 pints sweet milk 

Grate the cocoanut and pour over it the milk, and let it stand 
for twenty minutes. Put into a saucepan the butter, mix into 
it the curry powder, with one tablespoon of flour, the onion 
grated, the gingerroot chopped fine, mix together and add the 
milk with the cocoanut strained out. Cook together until it 
is smooth and thick, stirring all the time. Season with salt 
aiid pepper and a little sugar. This sauce can be used for any 
kind of curry. Cold meat or chicken, shrimps or lobster. It 
is only necessary to heat the sauce with the desired ingredients 
added. 



TO STEW WILD DUCK.— Mrs. C. H. Judd. 

Shred thyme, savory and sage very small (dried thyme, sav- 
ory and sage will do). Put them into some strong broth with 
a little pepper and salt, stew them together for y^ of an hour. 
Nearly roast the ducks ; add the gravy that falls from them to 
the sauce. Quarter the ducks, put them with the strained 
sauce into a stewpan over the stove, and let them stew until 
done. 



PIGEONS WITH PEAS.— Leon Dejean. 

Cut the pigeons in halves, trimming them neatly. Put a 
spoonful or two of butter in a saucepan and when hot add the 
pigeons with i/ 2 dozen cloves and 1 division of garlic. Keep 
the pot closely covered, and shake it frequently to stir pigeons. 
When you think they are done, uncover the pot and try them. 
If done take a can of peas, pour off all the water, and add the 
peas to the pigeons. Have ready on a platter some bread nice- 



47 

ly toasted, and when the peas are heated pour the whole over 
the toast and serve. No water is to be added. The pigeons 
cook in the butter and their own juices. Before serving them 
add salt if the butter and peas do not make the dish salt enough. 
One tin of peas is enough for 4 or 5 squabs. Cook rather 
slowly about 1 hour. 



CHICKEN POT PIE.— Mrs. Van Cleve. 

Cut up the chicken and put into a casserole that will cover 
very closely, layers of fowl and seasoning, salt, pepper, and if 
not -very fat, a little butter ; when full, put in a very little water 
and cover closely with a biscuit crust, not too rich, about 1 inch 
thick, then put on the cover and set in the oven. Bake slowly 
2 or 3 hours, according to toughness and quantity. I have 
found this a good way to treat any meat that is not very tender. 



OYSTER STUFFING FOR FOWLS.— Mrs. W. C. Parke. 

Take a loaf of stale bread, remove all the crust and soften it 
with boiling water. Drain off all the water as soon as it is soft- 
ened, and cover closely. When well softened, break up very 
fine the remainder of the loaf, add four tablespoons melted 
butter (or, if you wish to make it very rich, add eight spoonfuls), 
pepper and salt to season highly. Drain off all the liquor of a 
pint can of oysters, bring the liquor to a boil, skim, pour over 
the bread crumbs and add the soaked crusts. Beat in three eggs, 
mix thoroughly with the hands. If needed, add a little sweet milk. 
Last of all add the oysters, first putting in a spoonful of stuffing, 
then a few oysters, taking care not to break them, then stuffing 
in more oysters till the turkey is full. Stuff the breast first. 



MINCED TURKEY WITH POACHED EGGS. 

A very appetizing dish is made of cold boiled or roast turkey. 
Trim off all skin and most of the fat, especially that on the back ; 
pick out the little tid-bits in the recesses. Cut off all that will 
not look neat when sliced cold. Season with salt and pepper 
and a tablespoonful or two of minced celery, chop up the meat, 



48 

put it in a pan with a little butter or turkey fat to prevent burning, 
and just a suspicion of onion. Moisten with little broth made 
from the turkey bones. Poach one or two eggs for each person ; 
arrange the minced meat neatly on slices of buttered toast, place 
the egg on top and serve. The above mode of preparing a 
breakfast dish is not only economical, but produces one of the 
most delightful dishes that can be made. Almost any kind of 
boiled or roast meats and poultry or game can be utilized in 
this way. 



VEGETABLES 



POTATO PUFFS.— Mrs. Hascall. 

Two cups of mashed potatoes beaten until creamy with 1 
tablesoonful of butter, 1 cup of milk, 1 egg beaten light, salt 
to taste. Beat all thoroughly, pour into a buttered baking 
dish, and bake until brown. What is left from dinner is very 
nice cut in slices and fried for breakfast. 



MASHED KALO.— Miss Sophie Emerson. 

Wash and rub off all the rooty filaments and soil adhering 
to the kalo, and drop the clean root into boiling water. When 
tender, peel and mash with a long-tined fork. Sprinkle with 
salt and serve while steaming hot. 



BAKED TARO.— Mrs. P. C. Jones. 
Scrape all the outside off the taro, wash clean, and bake the 
same as potatoes. If the taro is large, cut in two lengthwise. 
Bake from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. When 
serving, do not cut with a knife, but gently press the taro with 
your hands and break it open. It will be mealy like a potato. 
Eat with salt and butter. 



FRIED TARO.— Mrs. P. C. Jones. 
Boil the taro with the skin on. When done, peel it as you 



49 

would a boiled potato. Cut it in slices, sprinkle with salt and 
fry in hot lard. 



TARO CAKES BAKED.— Mrs. P. C. Jones. 

Boil the taro until done, then when hot pound smooth, using 
as little water as possible. Mould with your hands into small 
cakes, put into a buttered pan and on top of each cake a little 
daub of butter. Bake until brown, and eat with butter. The 
children like them with butter and sugar. 

TARO CAKES.— Mrs. W. H. Rice. 

Pound the taro to the thickness of paiai (the stiffness of thick 
dough), nice and smooth, using as little water in so doing as 
possible, after which drop in a pinch of salt. Roll in flour. Be 
sure of always using the latter freely. Fry in hot fat, as in 
cooking doughnuts. 



LUAU. 

Put the young, tender taro leaves (luau) into hot water, and 
when they have boiled 10 or 15 minutes pour this water off 
through a colander and put in water and milk, and let it boil till 
the leaves lose their form and are very tender. Season with salt 
and butter. 



HA-HA. 



Take the inner stalk from a taro head, peel off the thin skin 
and put on to boil in hot water salted a little, and boil till tender. 
Then drain and lay the stalks on toast and pour over them 
drawn butter, sprinkling chopped hard-boiled egg on top, or 
chill and serve as salad with mayonnaise. 



STEWED BREADFRUIT.— Mrs. Hiram Bingham. 

Take the full-grown fruit before it is so ripe as to be sweet 
and soft; peel and cut into small pieces; boil in just sufficient 
salted water to keep from burning. When the breadfruit is about 



50 

cooked and the water nearly all evaporated, pour in milk made 
from the cocoanut. When thoroughly heated, it is ready for 
the table. Of course, the quantity of breadfruit and milk should 
be regulated by the number of persons for whom it is prepared. 
Breadfruit may be used in every way in which potatoes are used 
in potato-growing countries. 



BAKED BREADFRUIT.— Miss Teuira Henry. 

Pare off the skin of a breadfruit in the same stage as the 
above, cut it in half, lengthwise ; then cut it partially into quarters 
lengthwise, from the outer side, leaving the two halves still 
complete. Wash the breadfruit well in water and place it in a 
baking pan, turning the outer parts upwards, pour in a small 
teacup of water to cause steam, and let it bake in the same manner 
as bread, sprinkling it if need be, after the water dries up, to 
keep it from burning. When a nice, crisp crust has formed, the 
breadfruit is cooked, which can easily be tested by seeing if a 
fork meets with on obstruction in pricking it through. 



STEWED BREADFRUIT. 

Fresh breadfruit is very nice in stews instead of potatoes, but 
it requires more boiling than the latter. Small pieces of it cut 
up into soup are also excellent. In either case the breadfruit 
must not be cooked first, but used raw. 



GREEN PAPAIA WITH ONIONS. 

Take a green papaia that is just maturing but not in the least 
turning yellow, peel it and wash off the milky sap, cut it open 
and scrape out the seeds. Slice up the fruit as thin as shavings 
and boil it in two waters, pouring on boiling water for the second 
time. When cooked, drain off the water, fry some onions, and 
turn the papia into the frying-pan with them. Season with salt 
and pepper and a tablespoon of vinegar, and cover it over, letting 
it remain fifteen or twenty minutes upon the fire, turning it 
over occasionally with a spoon until all be well blended together. 

The papaia will then be ready to serve. 



51 

KOHL-RABI (Chinese Turnip).— Mrs. Spencer. 
This vegetable is found very often here now at the Chinese 
stands. Peel the roots, quarter, and cut them into thin slices. 
Boil in salted water until tender, then remove, and simmer a 
few minutes in the following sauce: a tablespoonful of butter, 
and a tablespoonful of flour cooked together (not browned). 
Add salt, white pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Thin it with boiling 
milk to the consistency of thick cream, and stir constantly until 
very smooth. Beat the yolks of one or two eggs, and whisk 
them into the sauce the last thing before serving. 



EGG PLANT.— Mrs. Spencer. 

Boil whole, then turn out lengthwise into halves, take out the 
meat, and season lightly with salt, pepper, a bit of chopped onion 
add a little very finely minced cooked chicken, tongue, veal or 
ham. Return this mixture to the egg plant shells, and brown 
them in the oven, after sifting a few bread crumbs over them. 



FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Peel and slice the egg-plant into thin slices, sprinkle with salt, 
and put between two plates with a weight on top. Leave for an 
hour or two. Dip in egg and breadcrumbs and fry in deep fat. 



STUFFED EGG PLANT.— Mrs. W. W. Hall. 

One egg plant, 1 teaspoonful salt, 3 good sized tomatoes, 1 
teaspoonful chopped onion, %. teaspoonful nutmeg, *4 teaspoon- 
ful pepper, 1 tablespoonful of butter, bread crumbs. Cut a 
medium sized egg plant into halves and scoop out the center 
leaving a wall y 2 inch thick. Chop the portion taken out, peel 
and chop the tomatoes and mince the two together, add the 
seasoning, return the mixture to the egg plant shells, sprinkle 
with bread crumbs and bake forty minutes in a moderate oven. 
This is excellent. 



52 

BAKED EGG PLANT.— Mrs. W. D. Alexander. 

One pint steamed egg plant, 1 pint bread crumbs, 2 well 
beaten eggs, salt, pepper and butter. Mix and bake in the 
oven. 



CREAMED LETTUCE.— Mrs. Spencer. 

Trim off the outside leaves, cut the heads into two parts (if 
large), boil in slightly salted water, press and drain thoroughly, 
and pour over them a rich, highly seasoned cream sauce. 



CREAMED CABBAGE.— Mrs. H. A. P. Carter. 

Chop the cabbage as for cold slaw, boil it 20 minutes, then 
drain carefully and cover it with milk; cook it until tender, 
season it with salt, pepper, a little buttefr, and just before 
serving add the yolk of an egg beaten with cream. 



COLD CREAMED CABBAGE.— Mrs. Hascall. 

Fill an ordinary vegetable dish with chopped cabbage, sprink- 
ling a little salt and pepper through it. To 1 small cup rich 
milk (cream is better) add 1 tablespoonful butter, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls sugar and boil. Take from the fire and stir into it 2 well 
beaten eggs. Set over the teakettle till it thickens like boiled 
custard. Then taking from the fire, add y 2 cup vinegar and 
quickly pour it over the cabbage. Cover and put in a cool place. 
To be eaten cold. 



BAKED TOMATOES.— Mrs. Hascall. 

Pour boiling water over and pare the tomatoes and slice a 
layer in the bottom of a well buttered baking dish. Sprinkle 
with bread crumbs, a little salt, pepper and sugar. Fill the dish 
with these alternate layers. (Some like a few slices of onion 
mixed with them.) Sift fine bread or cracker crumbs on top 
with some bits of butter. Cover and bake y 2 hour, remove the 
cover, and when a nice brown it is ready for the tab'le.

Four ears of corn, two eggs, 1 pint of milk, butter size of an 
egg, three tablespoonfuls of flour, salt and pepper. Cut the 
lines of corn down with a sharp knife, then with the back of 
the blade scrape from the cob; this leaves the hull of the corn 
on the cob, taking only the inner part. Beat the corn pulp 
thoroughly with the N other ingredients ; pour into a baking dish 
and bake one hour. Serve as a vegetable. 

This same mixture stewed is very good.

and remove stem and seeds. Stuff them with the same kind of 
force-meat that you would use for a turkey, put them into a 
baking dish with a little stock or water, and bake, basting 
occasionally. The peppers must be placed open end up in the 
dish. A simple stuffing of crumbs seasoned with butter, salt, 
pepper, onion and parsley, is also very nice, and so is sausage 
meat, mixed with bread crumbs. 



55

slice quite thin, into a dish, sprinkle a little sugar and grate nut- 
meg over the top. Let this stand half an hour. Just before 
taking to the table add cream or milk. Nice for lunch or tea. 



BANANA SAUCE.— Miss S. E. Emerson. 

A delicious sauce may be made from almost any kind of mellow 
banana by peeling the fruit, and putting over the fire in a porce- 
lain lined saucepan with a cup of sugar to every seven or eight 
bananas, also a cup of water. Lemon, orange or tamarind is 
then to be added to suit the taste.

long and less than two inches wide. Strew each strip with 
grated cheese, season with salt and pepper, fold lengthwise and 
pinch the edges together, bake in a quick oven. Wash over 
with beaten egg and sprinkle powdered cheese upon top, then 
shut the oven door just long enough to glaze them, which 



58 

will only take a minute, then pile them log-cabin fashion on a 
hot napkin laid folded on a hot plate; eat at once as they are 
not good cold, but make a nice relish when well prepared. 



CRACKERS AND CHEESE.— Miss Sara King. 

Take Boston crackers, split them and spread well with butter, 
sprinkled liberally with grated cheese and bake in a quick oven. 



EGGS 



OMELETTE. 

To every egg, add one tablespoon of hot water. Whites and 
yolks should be beaten separately. For a savory omelette add 
salt and pepper, a little onion juice if liked, finely chopped 
parsley or herbs. For a sweet omelette, sugar and flavoring 
as desired. Beat whites till the bowl can be turned upside 
down without them falling out. Beat yolks, and add the desired 
flavoring, mix thoroughly without beating and add the hot water. 
Melt a tablespoon of butter in the omelette pan, pour the mixture 
in, and cook steadily till set. 

Fish, chicken, cheese, oysters or peas may be added. Either 
one should be heated with a little butter and put on the omelette 
before browning the top. 



CODDLED EGGS. 

Put the eggs into a bowl and pour over them boiling water. 
After a minute or two pour the water off, and again pour on 
boiling water. Cover the bowl and in three or four minutes 
they will be soft-boiled, a longer time in the water makes them 
harder. Eggs cooked this way are very delicious. 



DEVILED EGGS.— Mrs. Hascall. 
Boil 6 or 8 eggs hard, lay in cold water until they are cold. 
Take off the shell, cut in halves, slicing a bit off the bottoms 



59 

to make them stand upright; extract the yolks and rub to a 
smooth paste with a little butter, salt, pepper, a very little mustard 
and just a dash of vinegar. Fill the hollowed whites with this, 
and send to table on bed of chopped cresses, seasoned with salt, 
pepper, vinegar, and a little sugar. Lettuce or white cabbage 
may be used instead of the water cresses. 



YEAST AND BREAD 



POTATO YEAST.— Miss Sophie Emerson. 

Grate one good-sized potato, add to it one and a half heaping 
tablespoonfuls salt and three of sugar. On this mixture pour 
one pint of boiling water, stir it up, set it away till lukewarm or 
cool, then add a tablespoonful of yeast. Pour into a large- 
mouthed glass jar. In 24 hours it will have risen and be fit to 
use. In a warm climate this yeast must be made every six or 
seven days. If there is no potato at hand, a small-sized kalo 
will do instead. In this case the grated Kalo, the salt and the 
sugar must be set over the fire in a porcelain-lined saucepan, 
and with the pint of boiling water poured in, allowed to boil 
up gently — just a minute and no more. 



BROWN OR GRAHAM BREAD.— Miss S. E. Emerson. 

To have a loaf risen and ready to bake by the morning fire, 
about 9 o'clock in the evening sift into an earthen bowl one- 
third of a quart of white flour and two-thirds of a quart of 
brown or Graham flour, the latter unsifted. Give the yeast 
jar a shake and pour into this flour 2 large spoonfuls of light 
yeast. Then stir in either milk or water slowly and a little 
at a time, till you have a batter thick enough to knead. If 
you have a sweet tooth, add a little brown sugar or molasses; 
lacking the latter, honey may be used. Now set away your 
stiff batter, well covered up, and attend to it the first thing 
in the morning, when, if it is risen, stir well or cut with a knife 
till the air cells are broken, and drop into a well oiled bread tin. 
Wet a spoon in water and smooth off the top a little and set 



60 

away by the stove to rise. It may take over an hour to rise, but 
often less time will do it. When you see it has risen, and the 
surface is slightly cracked, set the loaf into a slow oven and 
bake steadily. It must be borne in mind that brown bread 
requires a much longer time to bake than does a corresponding 
loaf of white bread. 



PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.— Mrs. Hyde. 
Two quarts of flour; make a hole in the center and put in 1 
tablespoonful sugar, butter size of an tgg, 1 pint of milk (boiled, 
but cold), J / 2 cup yeast. Stir, and let it rise over night. In 
the morning knead 15 minutes. Let it rise till 2 p. m., then 
roll thin and cut round ; put a little butter on one half and 
double over. If made in the morning, let it rise till noon ; 
then knead 15 minutes and let it rise till 2 p. m. 



PENNSYLVANIA RUSK.— Mrs. M. P. Chamberlain. 
Two pounds flour, 1 pint of good new milk, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of good yeast. Set the sponge to rise over night. Early in 
the morning add a little salt, 2 large spoonfuls of sugar (either 
white or brown), 3 large spoonfuls of butter, 2 well beaten 
eggs, and half a nutmeg; add flour till it is of the consistency 
of bread dough. Knead well for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
and set it to rise again. When risen, mould into cakes as large 
as a hen's tgg, place in pans and set to rise again. When well 
raised, beat the white of an egg with a little white sugar and 
brush them over the top. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes in 
a quick oven. 



BROWN BREAD.— Mrs. J. O. Carter. 
Two cups of sour milk, 1 cup molasses, 2 cups of Indian meal, 
1 cup flour (coarse preferred), \ J / 2 teaspoonfuls soda; add a 
little salt, and steam for 3 hours. 



NICE BREAD.— Mrs. J. M. Cooke. 
There must be good yeast. Into 3 quarts of sifted flour 
rub 1 large spoonful of lard, the same of sugar, and a tea- 



61 

spoonful of salt, 1 small cup of yeast in water or milk, and 
water enough to make a stiff batter, cover and let it rise over 
night. In the morning work in flour enough to mould up, 
using as little as possible, and have it free from the hands. 
Allow it to rise in a warm place till it is light, then divide it 
into 3 loaves, handle lightly and put it in pans. When light 
bake 1 hour in a moderate overu When removed from the 
pans stand on the side to cool. 



BREAD FROM WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR.— Mrs. Cornelia 

Damon. 

This is made just like any other bread only for white flour 
is substituted whole wheat flour in proportion of two parts 
whole wheat flour to one of white flour. A little sweetening 
as for Graham bread is liked by most every one, say three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar to a quart of flour. This is a matter 
of taste. 

Bread is delicious baked in cylindrical tins ; it gives a nice 
tender crust all over, and preserves the sweetness of the loaf ; 
the large-sized baking powder tins is a good size. When ready 
to form your loaves put the sponges into the tins, filling them 
about two-thirds or three-fourths full — experience will have to 
teach this — set them aside like loaves till light enough to bake, 
'then put. the covers on and bake, standing the tins in the oven 
three-quarters of an hour. The oven must be steady and mod- 
erate. 



GRIDDLE SCONES.— Mrs. Donald Maclntyre. 

Two breakfast cupsful flour, 3 large teaspoons baking powder 
(Royal), 2 small teaspoons sugar, 1 small teaspoon salt, 1 table-

butter and add it to the milk, mix all together into a soft 
smooth dough, roll out to an equal thickness about V2 inch, 
divide into eight equal parts or any style preferred. Bake on 
a hot plate or griddle, turning them occasionally till ready. Or 
bake them in a very hot oven. An egg added to the milk is an 
improvement.

teaspoonful salt, pepper to taste, and x /2 cup vinegar. Beat the 
mixture a long time, then add a cup of thick cream. If desired, 
add brown sugar and lime juice, about a teaspoonful of sugar. 
Take the small, crisp inside leaves of lettuce that has been kept 
a long time on the ice. Lay a row of them round the salad

shaken through them, a tablespoon of powdered sugar and

over them, dot some bits of butter and a little thinly sliced 
citron over the whole, add a suspicion of nutmeg and a very 
little lemon juice if the apples are not tart enough. Cover with 
puff paste and bake. Especially delicious when eaten with 
cream.

Squeeze the juice from the oranges with a lemon-squeezer, 
getting them as dry as possible. Free the juice from the seeds 
and set aside. Cut the orange skins into very thin strips (scis- 
sors are the best instrument for this). When they are all cut, 
put them into cold water over the fire, and as soon as they 
come to a boil pour the water off through a colander. Do 
this three times. After the water is poured off the last time, 
add the juice of the oranges to the skins, sweeten to taste and

again to boil. In 10 minutes put in the sugar, nearly quantity 
for quantity, and boil 20 minutes or half an hour, till it jells. 
Put the pulp up hot in glass jars (filling them full) without 
adding sugar, and use it for making pies. It will keep, if 
the jars are well filled and sealed, for six months. 



PRESERVED CITRON.— Mrs. F. S. Lyman, Hilo. 

Cut the citron in quarters, remove the center and soak the 
rind in cold water 3 to 5 days, changing the water morning 
and evening; water enough to cover them well. On the sixth 



107 



day put them over the fire in cold water enough to cover them 
and boil hard for 1 hour ; turn off this water, pour on a fresh 
supply and boil again 1 hour. Take the peel out onto a colan- 
der to dram, and prepare a syrup as for any other preserve. 
When the syrup is well boiled down, put the' peel in and boil 
for a good half hour. The next day lift out the citron, boil 
the syrup down once more and pour over the fruit; let this 
stand till next day; then spread the peel on pans in the sun 
to dry. Drying will take 2 or 3 days, when the peel can be 
put into wide-mouthed bottles and tightly corked. The syrup 
is excellent for cakes. 



APPLE MERINGO.— Mrs. T. S. Douglas. 
Peel and slice the fruit, using a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit. Boil the cores and peelings for 15 minutes, and 
strain this water on to the apples and sugar. Let the whole

half an hour. Skim the syrup and put in the fruit, which 
must boil half an hour ; then take it out and lay it on plates in 
the sun to dry. Let the syrup come to a good boil again ; then 
put in the fruit and boil another half hour. Put the preserve 
hot into glass jars ; cover, and tighten the covers when cold. 



ORANGE MARMALADE.— (Dundee).— Mrs. Edwin O. Hall.

large fruit). Cut these in thin slices, rind and all, cover with 
6 quarts of cold water and let it stand for 24 hours, then boil 
hard for 2 hours, add 8 lbs. of sugar, boil 1 hour. Just before 
taking from the fire add the juice of two lemons. 

This is excellent, equal to the best imported Dundee marma- 
lade.

sugar, vinegar and spices boil 10 minutes before adding the 
fruit. Let all boil together until the fruit is tender and well 
seasoned; then remove the fruit and let the syrup boil 5 or 
10 minutes longer. The liquor from this is excellent to add to 
mince meat.

DON'TS FOR MOTHERS. 

Dont try to do two days' work in one ; and, in your home- 
making, beware lest you become a veritable fiend of neatness. 

If work you must, simplify your duties so that they will 
not prove a weariness to the flesh. Never stand when you can 
sit down. When waiting at the counter for change, why neg- 
lect the stool close at hand? It is only a matter of five minutes, 
perhaps, but it may be five minutes too long, and then how 
your poor, tired back rebels !■ 



Ill 

Don't save horse-car fare for the sake of taking home a 
pound box of candy. It is a foolish woman who will squan- 
der her pennies on trash, and then walk her legs nearly off to 
make up the deficit. 

Don't try to do without your roll and coffee or glass* of milk 
when the luncheon hour arrives, no matter how long and dis- 
couraging your shopping list may be. 

In short, strive not to be an amateur in the art of caring for 
yourself, but in the details of life look well to it that they are 
made subservant to your womanly needs. 



SUNDRIES 



PAPAIA COCKTAILS. 

Scrape a ripe papaia, add lemon juice, or the juice of Chin- 
ese oranges, sweeten to taste ; set it in the ice chest till chilled 
then add to each cup of the mixture chopped ice and serve at 
once. (This is a nice appetiser with which to begin lunch or 
dinner. It is also a very refreshing relish to offer a tired 
friend on a hot day.) 



ALLIGATOR PEAR COCKTAIL. 

Cut the pulp of a ripe but firm pear into dice, season with 
cocktail catsup, lemon juice and salt, add a little ice water and 
bits of chopped ice, and serve in small cups or glasses. 



LEMON SQUASH.— Mrs. Donald Maclntyre.

of water. Peel very thinly the rind of the lemons, remove the 
white skin, cut up the lemons, throwing away all seeds, and 
boil with the sugar and water for three hours. It should then 
be thick and clear; strain and when nearly cold add the citric 
acid, stir till dissolved, bottle and cork tightly. A tablespoon 
to a glass of water makes a delicious drink. 



112 



CONFECTIONERY ' 



COCOANUT CANDY.— Mrs. P. C. Jones. 

Take 4 cocoanuts, remove the brown skin and chop the meat 
fine. To 1 bowl of cocoanut add 1 bowl of sugar, (the moist 
brown sugar is best, add a half cup of molasses if this sugar 
cannot be obtained.) Add a little water to the sugar, only 
enough to melt or partially dissolve the sugar, let it boil up 
well then add the cocoanut. Boil slowly until the cocoanut is 
well soaked in the sugar. Take out a little into a bowl, beat it 
a few minutes, and drop on well buttered paper. If it spreads 
out thin and watery it is not done. If it is done, it will keep 
its shape and harden into a cake. Do not try to drop from the 
kettle, but stir a little at a time in a bowl. The kettle should 
be set back on the stove where it can simmer gently while the 
dropping process goes on. The longer it simmers the richer it 
grows. This is an old standard recipe. 



VINEGAR CANDY.— Mrs. Edwin O. Hall. 

Two cups of sugar, ^4 of a cup of vinegar, ^ of a cup of 
water, butter the size of a walnut. Boil till it becomes brittle 
when dropped into cold water, then pour out on a buttered 
platter ; when cool pull it like old-fashioned molasses candy. 



PEPPERMINT DROPS.— Mrs. Edwin O. Hall. 

One-quarter cup of milk heated with a small piece of butter. 
Stir into the milk powdered sugar until the whole is stiff 
enough to knead like dough. Place this mass on a board and 
knead into it a few drops of peppermint oil. Make round flat 
drops and lay them on waxed paper to harden. 

A nice variation of this recipe is made by dipping these drops 
in melted chocolate.

A HAWAIIAN FEAST 



"AHAAINA," OR MORE COMMONLY CALLED "LUAU." 

Mrs. Brickwood and Daughters. 

Preparation. — If out in the yard under trees or under an 
awning, strew the straw or rushes over the place intended for 
the feast; then spread your mats, ti leaves or la'i in the place 
of a tablecloth ; then ferns on top of that, and then plates, cala- 
bashes (wooden bowls) or bowls of poi, and pig, turkey, 
chicken, raw fish, cooked fish, crabs and limu prepared in var- 
ious ways. 

How the Pig is Prepared and Cooked. — Kill and clean as 
usual, cut open, then cut under the fore shoulder. In the 
meantime have your furnace or imu ready and stones heated ; 
take some of the heated stones and put inside the pig (if you 
wish to stuff, put luau inside) ; spread ti leaves on the imu and 
banana leaves on the top of that, and then the pig; cover with 
the same kind of leaves as are under it ; spread over all old mat 
and then soil. Bake about two hours. 

How to Prepare and Cook Salt Pork, Beef, Turkey and 
Chicken, together or separate. — Heat banana leaves and slice 
your meat-and put into the leaves, with a little salt sprinkled 
over it and a little water. If you wish to put luau in with it, 
put a hot stone in the inside and tie up with ti leaves and put 
on the furnace. It can be cooked in the same furnace as the 
pig. Taro can also be cooked in the same place. First scrape 
the outside off, split in two and place on the fire. When cooked 
it is called "Kalo papaa," or baked taro. 

Luau is the taro tops (or leaves) of three kinds of taro — 
the Haokea, Lauloa and Apuwai. The young and new leaves 
are used for eating ; the old leaves are sometimes used for wrap- 
ping in place of ti leaves or banana leaves. 

Cooked or Lawalu Fish.— Take an anae, kuma, weke or any 
other kind of fish ; clean as you would for boiling ; take eight 
or ten ti leaves, sprinkle a little salt, then lay on your fish and 
wrap your leaves well round it, and put on coals to cook, turn- 
ing over now and again till cooked. Salt salmon is sometimes 



114 

cooked in the same way, having first washed off the salt ; or it is 
baked underground. 

Kaihelo, or Fish Sauce. — Grate a cocoanut, then take shrimps, 
sprinkle a little salt on them, pound or bruise them, put in a 
muslin cloth, and squeeze the juice over the grated cocoanut. 

Baked Hee, or Squid. — First pound with a little salt till it 
shrivels, then rinse out in water and put into banana leaves 
with ti leaves outside; then bake as the pig. 

Wana, or Sea Eggs. — Take the tongues of the wana and put 
into a large shell and cook on coals. 

Roast Kukui Nuts. — Roast your nuts on a slow fire or hot 
ashes, then when cooked break the shells and pound the meat 
into small pieces, mixing with a little salt. 

Limu, or Sea-weed. — Huluhuluwaena, Lipoa, Limu, Eleele, 
Limu Kala, Limu Kohu. 



PUDDINGS. 

Kulolo. — Grate cocoanut and strain, mix with grated taro, 
add a little water, about a pint of water to a quart of cocoanut 
juice. A little sugar is sometimes used. Use 2 taro roots to 
5 cocoanuts ; put into ti leaves, banana leaves or tin ; then bake 
underground. 

Koele Palau. — Sweet potatoes, boiled or baked underground, 
pounded or mashed ; then mix while hot with the juice of 
some grated cocoanut, and then it is ready for eating. 

Piepiele. — Grate the raw sweet potato and add the juice of 
grated cocoanut, and put into leaves and cook as "Kulolo." 

Haupia. — Mix pia or arrowroot with the juice of grated 
cocoanut. Heat some of the juice and add to the rest, and stir 
till cooked, as you would "Blanc Mange." 

Papaiee. — Take ripe breadfruit, scrape the inside and mix 
with a little cocoanut juice, or without; stir till well mixed 
and put into ti leaves as "Kulolo." 

Banana Pudding. — Grate the cocoanut as for Kulolo, put in 
the banana and mix, adding a little pia or arrowroot. When 
mixed put into banana leaves and ti leaves and bake. 



KULOLO, SOMETHING GOOD. 

Six cups taro flour, 4 cups cocoanut milk, 4 tablespoonful: 



115 

sugar ; grate fine the meat of 2 cocoanuts and mix all together 
well, put in a deep dish well buttered and bake 1 hour in a 
moderate oven ; eaten warm or cold it is excellent and cannot 
be beat. 



POI LUNCHEON COOKED OVER AN ORDINARY FIRE 
OR WITH A FIRELESS COOKER.— Mrs. Joseph Emerson. 

Table Arrangement. — Cover the tablecloth with ferns. At 
each place put a bowl of poi, salt dish or shell containing 
kukui nut or inamona, a small side plate with native salt, a 
few cooked shrimps, native onions, radishes and chili peppers. 
One can buy the cooked kukui nuts or inamona in the market. 
Crack the shells open and take out the kernel. Pound this 
with Hawaiian salt in a wooden dish or mortar. The Kauai red 
salt can be bought at the market by asking for paakai ulaula o 
Kauai. 

First Course. — Lomi lomi salmon. A salmon belly, toma- 
toes, 1 bunch onions. Soak salmon over night, pick it to 
pieces, removing all the white membrane, cut onion small, slice 
tomatoes (remove skin) add 4 whole chili peppers, mix all 
thoroughly and put on ice. Serve in a large glass dish with a 
lump of ice on top. 

Second Course. — Mullet orkumu, get small ones if possible, 
clean, sprinkle with coarse Hawaiian salt, tie up in ti leaves 
and broil. If not too large serve one to each person. 

Third Course. — Chicken, luau, sweet potatoes. 

For this purpose an old bird is just as good as a young one, 
have it cut in pieces, scald the luau and have the potatoes well 
scrubbed. Take an agate bowl that will fit a steamer or fire- 
less cooker container, and line it with banana leaves, then ti 
leaves, pack tight into the chicken, scalded luau and fill up any 
vacancies with sweet potatoes, scatter in coarse Hawaiian salt, 
cover all well with ti leaves and then with about four thick- 
nesses of banana leaves, over all put a folded cloth then the 
cover of the steamer. Fasten securely so to prevent any 
steam escaping, and do not open until ready to serve. Cook 
for four or five hours. 

Put by each guest a few cooked shrimps, radishes, Hawaiian 



116 

salt, chilis and native onions, poi and inamona, all of which are 
procurable at the fish market. 



PROVISIONS FOR ENTERTAINMENTS 

Allow a pound of butter for every twenty-five people, two 
pounds of boiled ham for sandwiches, one pound of coffee, 
one-half pound of loaf sugar, one quart of cream, and three or 
four cakes. « One quart of ice cream in bulk will serve seven 
or eight, in bricks it may be stretched to ten unless ice cream 
and cake are the only refreshments. Usually a quart of 
pickles and one of olives are sufficient for such a company. 
A quart of salad will serve twelve. 

For punch to serve a reception to fifty persons, use three 
dozen lemons, or two and a half dozen lemons and a dozen 
oranges, three bananas, one can grated pineapple, one can sliced 
pineapple, one quart of blackberry or other fruit juice and five 
pounds of sugar. 

When the refreshments are limited to one or two articles, a 
greater quantity of each must, of course be provided. 



EVENING OR WEDDING SUPPER SERVED BUFFET 

STYLE. 

Menu including a salad. 

One quart of salad should serve five persons, and fifty per- 
sons "will be amply supplied by 10 quarts. 

Allowing two rolls or biscuits for each person provide nine 
dozen for fifty guests, and two pounds of butter to be made into 
small pats. 

To make good coffee allow 2% pounds of ready ground high 
grade coffee. For hot cocoa or chocolate allow one pound of 
cocoa to ten quarts of liquid milk, or milk and water mixed. 
Provide about one-hundred and fifty lumps of sugar for the 
beverage. 

Ice-cream, either brick or bulk, should be ordered or made to 
provide for eight servings .to each quart. About eight quarts 
will be sufficient. If a fresh fruit or syrup sauce is served 
with the cream one quart will make ten servings. 



117 

As for the cakes, four average-sized loaf cakes will usually 
serve fifty, as each cake can be cut in ten or twelve slices. If 
small cakes are served allow two for each guest. 

Punch, to be served from a bowl during a reception should 
be provided in eight or ten quart quantities. 

In serving meats, one-third of a pound per person is allowed 
in purchasing raw meat, and if poultry is to be roasted the al- 
lowance is one-half pound each. If meat or poultry is made 
into a pie the amount for each quest is reduced to one-fourth 
pound. 

In serving canned fruit, two pieces or slices is allowed to 
each serving. 

A pie should furnish eight pieces and a medium-sized cake 
can be counted on for ten slices. 

For baked custards, puddings or molded desserts or salads 
the usual estimate is one-half pint to each serving.

especially appropriate for visitors from the mainland. 

First Course. — Tomato salad. 

Second Course. — Curry, with rice and accompaniments.

The tomatoes should be large red ones. Scald and remove 
skin, scoop out the center and set on ice. Just before serving, 
set on a lettuce leaf and fill with the following mixture: 
Chopped Hawaiian celery, a little sweet pickle, a few walnuts, 
a little onion juice mixed with a good mayonnaise. 

The curry can be fish, lobster, chicken, rabbit, lamb or 
mutton. A good curry sauce will be found on page (?). The 
accompaniments are steamed rice, served in a separate dish, 
and the following five served in the Chinese dish made spe- 
cially for the purpose : Guava jelly or quartered limes, 
chopped hard-boiled eggs, chutney, chopped peanuts, fresh 
grated cocoanut. 

The fruit sherbet should be made from any Hawaiian fruit 
in season : Grape, sour-sop, guava, roselle, papaia, mango, 
orange, fig, strawberry, pineapple or banana.

INVALID COOKERY 



BURNT FLOUR CUSTARD.— Mrs. R. Lewers. 

One pint milk, 1 egg well beaten, 4 lumps of cube sugar, 1 
pinch of salt, 1 tablespoon of burnt flour. Boil the milk; wet 
the flour with cold milk and the egg; stir into the boiling milk 
and strain. Excellent for the sick. 

We have given this to young babies, leaving out the egg and 
using two-thirds water and one-third milk, with excellent re- 
sults in bowel trouble. The flour should be browned in an 
iron pan. — Ed. 



BEEF TEA.— Mrs. W: F. Allen. 

Cut any desired quantity of beef into small slices and put 
(without water) into a double boiler, and let it cook an hour 
and a half, or until juice is extracted, but no longer, as it 
spoils the flavor. When done, strain, add salt and set away to 
cool. When cool so that the pot has hardened, strain through 
a cloth. Keep on ice for use when needed. 

Another. — A quicker way and a more nourishing beef tea is 
made by pressing the meat juice in a press made for that pur- 
pose. Cut from a good steak pieces two or three inches square ; 
put them on a gridiron and partly cook them on both sides. 
Have the press hot (and also a cup to hold the juice), and put 
in what it will hold, turning it until the meat is quite dry ; then 
empty and fill again until you have what is needed to take at 
once. Meat presses for this purpose can be had at Lewers & 
Cooke's and Dimond's. The one with the iron cup preferred. 



CHICKEN BROTH.— Mrs. W. F. Allen. 

Take a plump fowl (not less than a year old), have it dressed 
and divided. Pound it to crush all the bones, put in a sauce- 
pan and cover with cold water. Let it cook very slowly until 
the meat is in shreds, then season with salt (and a few white 
peppers if liked ; peppers if used should be cooked with the 
chicken), and strain. Remove the fat as well as possible, then 



119 

set away to cool. Put on ice until it jellies, when any remain- 
ing fat can be easily removed. When part is needed heat it 
and add a little boiled rice or toasted bread. Some sick people 
like the jelly. 

Raw Beef. — For serious cases of stomach trouble. Take 
a piece of tenderloin or good steak, and with a knife scrape 
the soft meat from the fibre, season with salt and pepper, and 
spread between two very thin slices of bread like a sandwich. 
Meat prepared this way and lightly broiled is very delicate 
for a sick person. 

Sago Gruel. — For a small bowl of gruel take a heaping table- 
spoonful of sago, wash in a little water, but do not let it soak; 
put it into a procelain-lined saucepan with a pint of cold milk 
and let it cook until the milk is thickened and the sago soft, 
perhaps ten or fifteen minutes. Excellent in bowel troubles. 



RAW BEEF TEA. 

To half a pound of raw beef, free from fat, and finely minced, 
add 10 grains of pepsin and 2 drops of hydrochloric acid. Put 
in a large tumbler and cover with cold water. Let it stand for 
2 hours in a temperature of 90°, being frequently stirred. Strain 
and serve in a red glass, ice cold. Peptonized food does not 
keep well, and should never be used more than twelve hours 
old. Preparations of beef which have been peptonized, or par- 
tially digested outside of the body, are far superior to beef 
tea. Beef tea is, however, much used, and would probably 
be preferable where ice is out of the question. 

Peptonized foods can only be used where ice is obtainable. 
Make it only in small quantities. — Ed. 



KOUMYSS. 

Dissolve a third of a cake of compressed yeast, or its equiva- 
lent in fluid yeast, in a little warm, not hot, water ; take a 
quart of milk fresh from the cow ,or warmed to about blood 
heat, and add to it a tablespoonful of sugar and the dissolved 
yeast. Put the mixture in bottles with patent stoppers ; fill 
to the neck and let them stand for twelve hours where you 
would put bread to rise; that is, at a temperature of 68° to 70°. 



120 

Then put the bottles, upside down, on the ice until wanted. 
This is nutritious and somewhat stimulant. It is very valuable 
and will sometimes be assimilated when nothing else can be 
retained. Each quart is said to contain 4 ounces of solid food. 



TOAST WATER. 

Toast 3 slices of stale bread a very dark brown, but do not 
burn. Put into a pitcher and pour over them a quart of boil- 
ing water ; cover closely and let it stand on the ice to cool. 
Strain. It is good for nausea from diarrhoea. 



APPLE WATER. 

Slice into a pitcher half a dozen juicy sour apples. Add a 
tablespoonful of sugar and pour over a quart of boiling water; 
cover closely until cold, then strain. This is slightly laxative. 



FLAXSEED LEMONADE. 

Into a pint of hot water put two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
three of whole flaxseed. Steep for an hour, then strain and 
add the juice of a lemon. Cool on the ice. 



CRUST COFFEE. 

Take a pint of crusts; those from Indian bread are best; 
brown well in a quick oven, but do not let them burn. Pour 
over them three points of boiling water ; steep for ten minutes. 
Serve with cream. 



LEMONADE WITH EGG. 

Beat one egg with two tablespoonfuls of sugar until very 
light; stir in three tablespoonfuls of cold water and the juice 
of a small lemon. Fill the glass with pounded ice and drink 
through a straw. 



EGG BROTH. 

Beat together one egg and half a teaspoonful of sugar till 



121 

very light, and pour on a pint of boiling water, stirring well 
to prevent curdling. Add salt and serve hot. 



HOT MILK AND WATER. 

Boiling water and fresh milk in equal parts compose a drink 
highly recommended in cases of exhaustion, as it is quickly ab- 
sorbed into the system with very little digestive effort. This 
is also true of the egg broth. 



CHICKEN CREAM. 

Take half the breast of a chicken, cut it very fine, then 
pound it in a mortar. Put a small teacupful of milk into a 
saucepan and heat it; then add the pounded chicken by 
degrees, stirring all the time till it is the consistency of thick 
soup. Put in a pinch of salt and pepper, one or two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, according to taste. Serve hot. This may 
be made with beef, mutton or veal, but the meat must always 
be thoroughly pounded first, and any fat removed.
