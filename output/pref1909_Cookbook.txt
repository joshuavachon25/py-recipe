WOMAN'S CLUB HOUSE 



The Sierra Madre Woman's Club was organized in 
March, 1907, with Mrs. J. A. Osgood as President and a 
membership of fifty-three. 

The object of this organization is "to stimulate intel- 
lectual development; to promote unity and good fellowship 
among its members; and to strengthen individual, philan- 
thropic and reformatory effort." At the present time there 
are about one hundred and ten members. The Club meets 
at three p. m. on the second and fourth Mondays of each 
month at the Woman's Club House. 

The Club House was completed July 1st, 1909. The 
auditorium of this building has a seating capacity of three 
hundred and fifty. With the addition of the lobbies, parlor 
and dining room, five hundred guests can easily enjoy 
any entertainment that can be put upon this stage. 

MRS. GEORGE H. LETTEAU, 
Dec. 11, 1909. President.

During the thirty-three months next following the incor- 



m 



poration of Sierra Madre as a city of the sixth class, there 
have been over 42,000 feet of streets improved with petro- 
lithic paving, which is at the rate of nearly fifty feet per 
day for the entire period. Added to this, 84,000 feet of 
curbing and 325,000 square feet of gutter, makes as fine a 
system of streets as any city of its class in Southern Cali- 
fornia can boast. 

All this has had no small influence, together with the 
score of other unparalleled points of advantage, in in- 
creasing the population of our city fourfold in this same 
short interval. 

C. W. JONES, 
President Board of Trustees.

I Sierra Madre Public Library | 



The Sierra Madre Public Library has been in existence 
more than twenty years. It was founded, and has been 
supported, by citizens of Sierra Madre, and not by Andrew 
Carnegie; a fact of some distinction in these days. 

The Library has spacious grounds and an attractive 
building. Three thousand volumes of choice literature are 
upon its shelves. The reading-room receives the principal 
magazines and periodicals of the day; and the reference 
room is equipped with cyclopaedias and other reference 
works. All these are accessible to anyone who chooses to 
consult them. A beginning has been made toward a section 
devoted to works referring to California and the Pacific 
Coast. It is hoped in time to make this an important de- 
partment. 

The Library is open during the afternoon or evening of 
each dav and a competent librarian is always in attendance. 

HENRY J. POTTER, 
President of Library Board.

The City of Sierra Madre is supplied with an abundance 
of the best mountain water taken from tunnels in the solid 
rock and conveyed by pipes into covered reservoirs and from 
thence distributed through twelve miles of pipe to its con- 
sumers. This supply is augmented by a complete pumping 
plant which is always available. The company being 
mutual and not for profit, all property owners are interested 
for its best welfare, and its board of directors are ever on 
the alert to see that all residents have an ample supply of 
pure water. 

Under a recent analysis by our State Chemist at Berkeley 
the water was pronounced free from all impurities.

LOOKING TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS 



Knights of King Arthur 



This boys' club was organized a little over two years 
ago and now has an active membership of twenty members, 
boys of twelve years and over being eligible. The growth 
and work of the club was hampered by not having a suitable 
meeting place, but last spring, sufficient money having 
been raised by subscription and entertainments, a frame 
building was erected on East Central Avenue on land 
loaned by Mrs. J. H. Wright. This is intended to serve as 
a club room and gymnasium, and will be more completely 
fitted up for the latter purpose as soon as the small out- 
standing debt against the building is paid. The club is 
not allied with any church or other organization, but is 
controlled entirely by the boys themselves under the super- 
vision of Mrs. Wright.

and sides. Will set quickly, if enough sugar is used.

Postal Receipts Growing 






The figures showing business done by postoffices are be- 
coming accepted more and more as a reliable source of 
information as to the growth and cities and smaller com- 
munities. It is therefore of interest to note the increase 
in the business done by the Sierra Madre Postoffice as set 
forth in the following statment: 

costal receipts for quarter ending Jan., '07, were $575.10 
Postal receipts for quarter ending Jan., '09, were $917.62 

Sierra Madre being a residential community, the increase 
in postal receipts indicates a rapid growth in the number 
of patrons of the office.

Bank Reflects Prosperity 

3Wi><i<t*i'^^ 

The First National Bank of Sierra Madre received its 
charter from the Comptroller of the U. S. Government May 
25th, 1907, and opened for business June 17th, 1907. It 
is said that the growth of a city is shown by the increase 
in the bank deposits, and such being the case the officers 
take pleasure in submitting the following: 

At the close of business August 22nd, 1907, the first re- 
port to the Comptroller, the Loans and Discounts were 
$23,560.55; Deposits $23,155.61; Total Assets $55,092.61. 

At the close of business Dec. 2nd, 1909, the assets 
were $127,728, an increase of 130 per cent; Deposits $75,- 
681.20, an increase of 226 per cent; Loans and Discounts 
$58,883.62. This showing is the more gratifying when we 
consider the fact that the recent financial stringency oc- 
curred during the past two years. 

On July 1st, 1909, this bank declared its first semi- 
annual dividend and also set aside a substantial amount 
to its Surplus Fund. Careful management and satisfied 
depositors are shown by the above figures. On Dec. 1st, 
1909, the bank announced the opening of its new Interest 
Department, in which Department sums of one dollar and 
upwards are received, not subject to check, and on which 
4 per cent interest is paid semi-annually.

Grape Fruit Marmalade 

Take three good-sized grape fruit and with a sharp knife (after 
washing the fruit) slice fine all .the out and inner skin to the soft 
part, which you slice, removing the seeds as you come to them; slice 
to the center, which you will find pithy and dry, and throw that 
part away; the seeds put in a bowl by themselves. Three good- 
sized grape fruit with the juice of two oranges will make two quarts. 
Put this in your kettle with three quarts of cold water; put some 
of this water, about half a pint, on the seeds. After it has stood for 
twenty-four hours, strain the water and seeds through a bowl strainer 
into the kettle; put kettle on the stove and boil nearly or quite two 
hours, then add five pounds of cane sugar, stirring until dissolved,
