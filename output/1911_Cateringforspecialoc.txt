" You must come home with me and be 

my guest; 
You will give joy to me, and I will do 
All that is in my power to honour you." 

Shelley 




A FOREWORD 



Americans of to-day are accused, somewhat 
unjustly, it seems to me, of being inhospitable. 
Because we do not, in the manner of a genera- 
tion or two ago, lay aside all our duties at the 
visit of friends and welcome them ungrudgingly 
to our ordinary meal we expose ourselves to 
this charge; but, in truth, it is a higher concep- 
tion of hospitality that has brought about this 
change. In these days of rapid transit, by sea 
as well as by land, the markets of the world are 
brought almost to our very doors, and we have 
a hundred combinations to our grandmother's 
one. We, therefore, receive our guests more 
formally; we make preparations for their coming, 
and take pleasure in giving them a meal which 
shall vary from the humdrum order of culinary 
production. The fashion in entertaining, as 
in so many other things, has changed, and con- 
sciously or unconsciously we conform to the 
new standards. And why, on the whole, is 




Vlll 



A Foreword 




not the new hospitality more satisfying, both 
to the host and guest, than the old? It seems to 
me that housekeepers are enjoying as never 
before the days set apart for their friends, and 
have learned to appreciate the saying of Brillat- 
Savarin, "He who receives friends, without 
himself bestowing some pains upon the repast 
prepared for them, does not deserve to have 
friends." And certainly there is none of us so 
regardless of the delights of the table that he 
does not respond to the warming influences of a 
meal prepared by a thoughtful hostess as a trib- 
ute to him as a guest. 

The difficulty for the housekeeper lies in the 
selection of an appropriate menu. This little 
book is intended to meet this difficulty. May it 
be a help to many! 

Let me ask you to remember that all the recipes 
have been thoroughly tested, and not found 
wanting. You should have in mind, too, that 
in all these rules of mine the measurements are 
made level. Measuring cups, divided into thirds 
and quarters, are used; also tea and tablespoons. 

With these words let me leave you to the 
enjoyment of the new hospitality! 

Fannie Merritt Farmer.

fourth inch slices. Spread sparingly with butter 
and then with orange marmalade. Put together

8 lbs. sugar 
4 quarts water 




Wipe fruit and cut crosswise in as thin slices as 
possible, removing seeds. Put into preserving 
kettle, add water, cover, and let stand thirty- 
six hours. Place on range, bring to boiling- 
point, and let simmer two hours. Add sugar and 
let simmer one hour. Turn into sterilized jelly 
tumblers and cover each glass with a circular 
piece of paraffine paper, then with a large cir- 
cular piece of letter paper, fastening paper securely 
over edge of glass with mucilage. 

BUTTERED EDUCATORS

time, using the hands. Press evenly into a 
buttered dripping pan and prick with a fork.

bake in a slow oven. As soon as taken from oven, 
turn from pan, remove paper, and cut cake in

one slice onion, one slice carrot, one sprig parsley,

Melt three tablespoons butter, add three table-

one cup thin cream and one-half cup heavy cream. 
Bring to the boiling-point, add sweetbreads, 
drained from sherry and cut in small cubes, and

St. Valentine's Spreads 



Mix dry ingredients, add milk gradually, and 
beaten egg; then add olive oil. Shape, using a 
hot, heart-shaped timbale iron, fry in deep fat 
until crisp and brown; take from iron and invert 
■ n brown paper to drain. 

To 11 ml Timbale Iron. — Heat fat until nearly 
hot enough to fry unccol ed mixtures. Put iron 
into hot fat, having fat deep enough to more than 
cover it, and let stand until heated. The only 
way of knowing when Iron is of right temperature- 
is to take it from fat. shake what fat may drip 
from it. lower in batter to three-fourths its 
depth, raise from batter, then immerse in hot fat. 
If batter does not cling to iron, or drop, from iron 
as soon as immersed in fat, it is either too hot or 
r.ot sufficiently heated. 

To Form Timbales. Turn timbale batter into 
a cup. bower hot iron into cup, taking care that 
batter com r- iron to only three-fourths its depth. 
When immersed in fat, mixture will rise to to]) 
of iron, and when crisp and brown may be easily 
slipped off. If too much batter i- used, in cooking 
it will rise over top of iron, and in order to remove 
timbale it must be cut around with a sharp knife 
close to top of iron. If the cases are soft rather 
than crisp, batter is too thick and must be diluted 
with milk.

Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water

shape remainder into a circular piece one-half 
inch thick, and put on floured board. Work 
two tablespoons of butter into flour with the tips 
of fingers of the right hand. Moisten to a dough 
with cold water, turn on slightly floured board, 
and knead one minute. Cover with towel and 
let stand five minutes. 

Pat and roll one-fourth inch thick, keeping 
paste a little wider than long, and corners square. 
If this cannot be accomplished with rolling-pin, 
draw into shape with fingers. Place butter on 
centre of lower half of paste. Cover butter by 
folding upper half of paste over it. Press edges 
firmly, to enclose as much air as possible. 

Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, 
the left side under enclosed butter. Turn paste 
half-way round, cover, and let stand five minutes. 
Pat, and roll one-fourth inch thick, having paste 
longer than wide, lifting often to prevent paste 
from sticking, and dredging board slightly with 
flour Avhen necessary. Fold from ends toward 
centre, making three layers. Cover, and let 
stand five minutes. Repeat twice, turning paste 
half-way round each time before rolling. After 
fourth rolling, fold from ends to centre, and double, 
making four layers. Put in cold place to chill;

if outside temperature is not sufficiently cold, fold 
paste in a towel, put in a dripping-pan, and place 
between dripping-pans of crushed ice. If paste 
is to be kept for several days, wrap in a napkin, 
put in tin pail and cover tightly, then put in cold 
place; if in ice-box, do not allow pail to come in 
direct contact with ice. 

Baking of puff paste requires as much care and 
judgment as making. After shaping, chill thor- 
oughly before baking. Puff paste requires hot 
oven, greatest heat coming from the bottom, that 
the paste may properly rise. While rising it is 
often necessary to decrease the heat by lifting 
covers or opening the check to stove. Turn fre- 
quently that it may rise evenly. 

Rules for Washing Butter. — Scald and chill an 
earthen bowl. Heat palms of hands in hot water 
and chill in cold water. By following these direc- 
tions, butter will not adhere to bowl nor hands. 
Wash butter in bowl by squeezing with hands until 
soft and waxy, placing bowl under a cold-water 
faucet and allowing water to run. A small 
amount of butter may be washed by using a 
wooden spoon in place of the hands.

cake of fat, which may be easily removed. Finely 
chop meat, and add it to twice the amount of 
finely chopped apples. The apples should be 
quartered, cored, and pared previous to chopping, 
or skins may be left on, which is not an objection 
if apples are finely chopped. Add sugar, molasses,
