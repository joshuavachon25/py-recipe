DELICIOUS SWANS DOWN CAKE 

1 2 cupful butter, or substitute 3 teaspoonfuls baking powder 

1 cupful sugar Vi teaspoonful salt 

2 3 cupful milk 1 teaspoonful vanilla 
2 cupfuls SWANS DOWN CAKE FLOUR 3 egg whites 

Cream butter, gradually add sugar, creaming mixture well. Sift flour once, measure, add 
baking powder and salt and sift three times. Add the flour and milk alternately to the creamed 
butter and sugar, beating batter hard between each addition of flour and milk. Add vanilla 
extract. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites and bake in a loaf or two layers in a moderate 
oven. Ice as desired. 

Before attempting to make any cakes in this book, read this article. It may prevent a cake 
failure, thereby saving the waste of ingredients. These are the four most important steps 
in cake-making, and if followed carefully will help you to make really, good cake. 

SELECTING INGREDIENTS 

A good cake cannot be made with poor ingredients. For the best results choose only the 
purest materials obtainable. Cake is a food that contains the most nutritive elements, such 
as eggs, butter, milk, sugar, flour, etc. Cake is more delicate than bread and needs a more 
delicate flour. This flour is Swans Down Cake Flour, soft, white, and velvety, made especially 
for cake and pastry making. Swans Down costs but a few cents more per cake and yet it 
insures against disappointment and costly cake failures. Lighter, whiter, finer, better cakes 
if you use Swans Down. 

MEASURING 

All ingredients called for in any good recipe must be accurately mixed and all measure- 
ments should be level. This is necessary in order to obtain the same results in each baking. 
The standard one-half pint measuring cup should be used and the recipe followed exactly. 

CAREFUL MIXING 

It is necessary in successful cake making that all ingredients be perfectly measured and 
utensils and cake tins be ready before beginning to mix the cake. Always beat the shortening 
to a cream before adding any sugar. Add sugar gradually, creaming the mixture meanwhile. 
Add a little sifted Swans Down Cake Flour, with baking powder added, then a little milk and 
so on alternately until all the flour and milk are used, beat the batter, never stirring, after each 
addition of flour and milk. Add flavoring. lhe stiffly-beaten egg-whites should be next 
folded in very carefully if recipe calls for same. Work quickly, but carefully, in mixing 
your cake. 

CORRECT OVEN HEAT 

The heat of oven for cake making is of very great importance. There are some general 
guides for temperature which may be profitably observed. All thin layer, small cakes and 
cookies require a hot oven (350-400°F). Thick layer and cakes baked in a loaf require a mo- 
derate oven (325-375°F) while sponge cakes and angel cakes require a slow oven (250-300°F). 
Fruit cakes require even a slower oven (200-250°F). 

The helpful hints above are taken from "Cake Secrets," an authoritative booklet on cake 
making by Janet McKenzie Hill, editor of American Cookery Magazine. You are welcome 
to a copy full of original recipes, directions, illustrations — for 10c sent to Igleheart Brothers, 
Evansville, Indiana, Department C. I. Best grocers everywhere have Swans Down Cake 
Flour. If you cannot get it, write us. Use it in your cake and pastry making. 

Always use Swans Down Cake Flour in all cake recipes given injhis book and elsewhere. 
It insures lighter, whiter, finer cakes.

KELLOGG'S BRAN 

MAKES the best bran muffiins you ever ate — 
and they help keep you healthy 

Kellogg 's Bran is not only ready to eat — a brand- 
new cereal food made of bran — but because of its 
unusual goodness and choice flavor it is away ahead 
of ordinary brans for making 
bread, muffins, gems, pancakes, 
etc. 

Muffins made with Kellogg's Bran 
— whether you use your own recipe 
or follow the one on the package — 
are not only light and tempting, but 
they have a rich, palatable taste. This 
is because we keep the nutlike flavor 
in the bran as we krumble it, and 
bring out a sweet, pleasing flavor 
besides. 

Millions of people have welcomed 
Kellogg's Bran. For them it makes a 
pleasure instead* of a distasteful task 
of eating bran in some form every day 
to avoid constipation. 

CAUTION— Be sure to get the 
genuine. Ask your grocer for Kel- 
logg's Bran. Bemember the name 
KELLOGG'S. You only get the wax- 
tite package bearing the signature of 




Kellogg' s Bran 
, Muffins 

Cream 34 c. sugar, 
and shortening size 
of an egg, together. 
Add to this one egg, 
1 c. sour milk (or 
sweet milk), 1 c. 
Kellogg's Bran, \]/i 
c. flour, 1 level tsp. 
soda (or 2 tsp. bak- 
ing powder if sweet 
milk is used), Pinch 
Salt. Mix well. 

This will make 
twelve large deli- 
cious muffins.

SOUPS 



"Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli; 

For love must be sustained like flesh and blood; 
While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly; 
Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food." 

Stock For Soups 

Stock for soups is made from meat or bones, or of 
cooked joints of meat (omitting the fat — this would 
give a tallowy flavor to the soup), to which may be 
added chicken, turkey, beef, or mutton bones, well broken 
up. Put all this in cold water without salt; let it come 
slowly to boiling point, then skim well; set it back and 
let it simmer gently for six hours, until the meat is in 
shreds. Rapid boiling hardens the fiber of the meat, and 
the savory flavor escapes with the steam. Add a little 
pepper and salt, strain into a stone jar, let it cool, and 
remove all the grease. This stock will keep for many 
days in cold weather, and from it can be made all the 
various kinds of soups. 

White Soup 

A knuckle of veal, 2 turnips, 1 carrot, 2 tablespoons of 
whole pepper, 2 tablespoons of ground rice or farina. 
Boil and strain through a sieve. Beat the yolks of three

eggs; put in a very little of the whites, add a pint of 
cream. Do not boil the eggs and cream, but put them 
in a tureen and stir as you pour the soup upon them. 

Mrs. Anna Scott. 

Oyster Soup 

Drain 1 can of oysters. Boil the liquor and 1 pint of 
water; skim well. Season with butter, pepper, and salt. 
Add oysters and let come to a boil, then add 1 cup milk 
or cream, heated separately. 

Miss Cora C. Leon. 

Tomato Soup 

One quart canned tomatoes, 2 heaping tablespoons of 
flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 of sugar, and 1 pint of hot 
water. Let tomatoes and water come to a boil. Rub 
flour, butter, and a little tomato juice together, stir into 
boiling mixture. Boil 15 minutes. Strain through a sieve 
and serve with dice of toasted bread. 

Mrs. Walter Clark. 

Tomato Soup 

One quart of tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 quart of hot 
water, 1 teaspoon sugar, pepper to taste, 4 cloves, 1 table- 
spoon of butter, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, 1 tablespoon 
chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon corn-starch. Add cloves, 
salt and pepper to tomatoes and boil in a porcelain kettle. 
Put the butter in a saucepan and when it bubbles, put in 
the onion and parsley. Fry five minutes, being careful 
not to burn it; let it simmer ten minutes; add more salt

in a little water. Serve with boiled rice or toasted crackers 

Mrs. Sallie Palmer.

Pea Soup 

Soak 1 quart split peas over night. Next morning boil 
with 2 carrots, 2 onions, 1 stalk celery and a little piece 
of salt pork. Boil all the morning, being careful not to 
scorch; strain, and serve hot. 

Mrs. Arthur Smith. 

Green Pea Soup 

Cover a quart of green peas with hot water, and boil 
until they mash easily. Mash, and add 1 pint of stock or 
water. Cook together 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 of 
flour, until smooth, but not brown; add to the peas and 
then add 1 cup of milk and 1 of cream. Season with salt 
and pepper, and boil once; strain and serve. A cup of 
whipped cream added at the last moment is an improve- 
ment. Canned peas may be used if desired.

Suggestions For Baking Meat or Tame Fowl 

Do not season, or put water in the dripper for 30 min- 
utes, after placing in a very hot oven. Then season well, 
add hot water, and bake slowly, basting often. Meats 
baked in this manner retain all their juices, instead of 
being drawn out by steam and salt.

TO RE SERVED WITH ROAST MEAT. 

Four eggs beaten very light, a pinch of salt, 12 heaping 
tablespoons of flour, 1 pint of milk; beat part of the flour 
with the eggs, and add the rest of the flour and milk 
gradually. Bake with the meat three quarters of an hour 
before the roast is done. May be baked without meat by 
putting 2 or 3 tablespoons of the drippings from the meat 
in a pan, and when hot pour in the batter, basting oc- 
casionally. Cut in squares and serve on the platter with 
the roast.

JELLIES AND CONSERVES 



Jellies of Any Kind 

To each pint of juice allow 1 lb. of sugar; set the juice 
on to boil, and while it is boiling, divide the sugar in 
shallow pans, and heat in the oven, stirring occasionally 
to prevent burning. Boil the juice 20 minutes from the 
moment it begins to bubble. By this time the sugar 
should be too hot for the finger to bear. Should it melt 
around the edges, do not be alarmed; the burnt part 
can be easily taken out. Throw the sugar into the boil- 
ing juice, stirring it rapidly all the while. Withdraw as 
soon as the sugar is dissolved. Let it come to a boil, and 
take instantly from the fire. Will certainly jelly. 

Mrs. I. L. Stone. 

Pine-Apple Marmalade 

Pare the pine-apples, and pick out all the little eyes; 
then weigh, and to every lb. of ungrated fruit, take f lb.

White Fondant 

Two and one-half pounds sugar, If cups hot water, 
\ teaspoon cream of tartar. Put ingredients into a 
smooth granite stewpan. Stir, and then heat gradually 
to boiling point. Boil without stirring until, when 
tried in cold water, a soft ball may be formed that will 
just keep in shape. After a few minutes' boiling sugar 
will adhere to sides of kettle. This should be washed 
off with the hand first dipped in cold water. Have a 
pan of cold water near at hand, dip hand in cold water, 
then quickly wash off a small part of the sugar with 
tips of fingers, and repeat until all sugar adhering to 
side of sauce pan is removed. If this is done quickly 
there is no danger of burning the fingers. Pour slowly 
on a slightly oiled marble slab or platter. Let stand a 
few minutes to cool, but not long enough to become hard 
around the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping knife 
to one end of marble, and work with a wooden spatula 
or spoon until white and creamy. It will quickly change 
from this consistency and begin to lump, when it should 
be kneaded with the hands until perfectly smooth.

Salted Almonds 

Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over 
them, and let them stand until the water is cool. Then 
slip off the skins. Butter very freely a frying-pan or 
dripper, put the almonds in it, and bake in the oven, 
stirring frequently, until they are well browned. Take 
from the oven and salt while hot, that the salt may 
adhere to the buttered nuts.

Candied Grape Fruit Peel 

Save grape fruit rinds, the thicker the better. Cut 
in quarters and then in strips. Put on fire in cold 
water. When it comes to a boil, drain and repeat 
three times. Make a heavy syrup, allowing 1 cup 
sugar to each grape fruit. Add peel and cook, stirring 
constantly till syrup is all absorbed. Lay on brown

Read The Good Health 
Magazine 

IT was the pioneer magazine in teaching biologic living, and 
it stands alone. When the magazine (under another name) 
was established in 1866, the Editors adopted a policy 
which has been maintained at the same high standard 
throughout the years. 

When you select a magazine, you want one that is worth 
while. The majority of thinking people will at once admit that 
health is the most important and valuable of a man's assets. 
Without it, one is crippled in every line of endeavor. GOOD 
HEALTH tells you how to keep well. 

There is no periodical in the world that contains such a 
wealth of general health information, dietetics and all that 
pertains to the art and science of health and longevity, as the 
GOOD HEALTH magazine. John Harvey Kellogg, M. D., 
LL. D., is'the Editor-in-chief. Dr. [Kellogg' s work as the 
builder and medical chief of the renowned Battle Creek San- 
itarium is well known. His forceful editorials, as well as 
other articles in GOOD HEALTH, are widely copied and 
commented upon in journals throughout the country. 

One year's subscription to GOOD HEALTH costs only 
$2. SO. Mail your subscription remittance today. Send 
a postal card request for a sample copy of GOOD HEALTH.

WHAT WOULD A GOOD RECEIPT BE 
WITHOUT GOOD MATERIALS 

The most skillful chef in the world, working with 
a tried and tested recipe would achieve poor 
success unless his ingredients were exactly what 
he knew them to be. 

But with the ingredients of known quality and 
merit his simplest dishes would be fit to set be- 
fore a king. 

For years, this store has been dealing in groceries 
and supplies of known quality and established 
merit — on that basis the reputation of this store 
has been built. 
Just as the excellence of the recipes in this book 
has been established by test, so has the reputa- 
tion of this store.

^ttar of roses is distilled from the crushed petals

beauty, the rose withers and is gone — but lives 
for ages as an essence, inexpressibly sweet.

tills the perfection of the character. - And, ill for- 
tune brings out a sweet nobility.
