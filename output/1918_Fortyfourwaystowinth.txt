FORTY- FOUR WAYS 

TO 

WIN THE WAR 



Wars are not won by battles alone. 
The big drives of the Allies, 
are not achieved by momentary 
inspiration, but by weeks of 
careful, calculating preparation 
behind the lines. Just so, every 
ounce of meat or wheat or sweet 
that we save in our kitchens is 
careful, calculating conservation 
of the war's most vital and impor- 
tant necessity — FOOD. 




In this little book we have com- 
piled forty-four wartime recipes 
that commend themselves to 
popular favor by reason of their 
nutritive and palatable qualities. 







Our normal export of 88,000,000 bushels of loheo.L 
must he increased to 220,000,000 bushels. It caiij.e. 
done in only one way: Econo?nizing and subst-Uuting 



BREADS THAT AID IN CONSERVING WHEAT 



Old Glory Bread' 



1 cup rye flour 
8 cups white flour 
1 teaspoonful salt 
3 tablespoonfuls shortening 
(may be omitted). 



3 cups whole wheat flour 

4 cups water 

1 yeast cake or more, accord- 
ing to the length of time 
allowed for rising. 



Add salt and shortening to boiling water. Cool to lukewarm.. Add 
yeast cake, dissolved in a little of the cool water. Add flours, sifted together, 
and knead until smooth and soft. Let rise in warm room until double its 
size. Knead and divide into loaves. Let rise as before and bake one hour. 
This recipe makes four medium sized loaves. 



Rolled Oat Bread 

Scald one cup rolled oats in one cup boiling water and allow to stand one 
hour. Make a sponge of 



1 cup water 

1 cake compressed yeast 

1 teaspoonful salt 



2 tablespoonfuls molasses 
2 teaspoonfcils shortening 
^ cup flour 



Add rolled-oat mixture to sponge, and then flour to make medium soft 
dough. Form into loaf and let rise to double its bulk and bake. 




A Bread Mixer that only asks 
to have all necessary ingredients 
placed inside and its handle 
turned^ guarantees that the dough 
shall come out properly kneaded 
and blended. Of stamped steel, 
heavily tin plated, they range in 
price, according to size, from $2 
to $4. The one shown is four-loaf 
size. Price $3.

We have plenty of corn lo send our Allies, but except 
in Italy there are feiv corn mills, and corn meal is 
not durable enough to ship in large quantities 



BREADS THAT AID IN CONSERVING WHEAT 

Rye Bread 

Use any method for white bread, but be careful to use two cups of rye 
flour for each cup of wheat flour mentioned in the recipe. Rye bread should 
be softer than white bread, but wefl kneaded. When light, form into loaves 
and allow to rise to double their size. Brush over with water and egg and 
bake in a slower oven than for white bread. Many people like the flavor 
of caraway seeds in rye bread. These may be put into the sponge. 



Barley Bread 



2 cups whole wheat flour 
4 cups barley meal or barley 

flour 
1 cup water 
1 cup milk 



2 tablespoons molasses 

^ yeast cake (compressed) 

1 teaspoon salt 



Boil milk and water, and cool. Add molasses, salt and yeast mixed 
with a little cold water. Stir in flour and barley meal (or barley flour) which 
have been sifted together. Knead to a soft dough, adding more flour if 
necessary. Cover and let rise until the mixture is double its bulk. Knead 
a second time, form into loaves, place in well greased pans and let rise a second 
time until the dough has doubled its bulk. Bake in a hot oven from one-half 
to one hour, the time depending on the size of the loaves. 



To start the day aright toast is an 
important factor. If cold and 
moist one's spirits descend. If 
hot and crisp one's spirits buoy- 
antly arise. To assure freshness 
the Electric Toaster is essential. 
The one shown is iiJtproved with a 
rack for keeping the toast hot. 
Price $6.

flour for one pound of wheat flour weekly per

BREADS THAT AID IN CONSERVING WHEAT 
Steamed Brown Bread 



1 cup corn meal 
1 cup barley flour 
1 cup rye flour 
^ cup molasses 



2 cups sour milk 

1 teaspoon soda 

2 teaspoons baking powder 



X^ teaspoon ginger 
}i teaspoon salt 



Sift corn meal, barley flour and rye flour, baking powder, salt and ginger. 
Dissolve soda in a little cold water; add the sour milk. Combine the liquid 
with the dry ingredients, beat well, and steam in well greased brown bread 
tin or baking powder cans from five to six hours, depending upon the size of 
the tin. 



Spoon Corn Bread (without Wheat) 



2 cups water 

1 cup milk 

1 cup white corn meal 



1 tablespoon butter 

2 teaspoons salt 
2 eggs 



Mix the water and the corn meal and bring slowly to the boiling point 
and cook five minutes. Add the eggs, well beaten, and the other ingredients. 
Beat thoroughly and bake in a well greased pan for twenty-five minutes in 
a hot oven. Serve from the same dish with a spoon. 

This serves six people. 




Whole wheat, graham flour and 
corn meal may be as impartially 
groimd as bread crumbs and peanuts

hopper, $4.75.

BREADS THAT AID IN CONSERVING WHEAT 
Crackling Bread (without Wheat) 



1 quart corn meal 
1 pint cracklings 



3 teaspoons salt 
Boiling water 



Mix the corn meal and salt; pour over this mixture enough boiling water 
to moisten, but not enough to make a mush. When the meal has cooled, work 
the cracklings into it with the fingers. Form the dough into cakes about 
four inches long, two inches wide, and one inch thick. Bake for thirty minutes. 
This bread, because of its large percentage of fat, is eaten without butter, 
and should be served very hot. 



Apple Corn Bread (without Wheat) 



2 cups white corn meal 
2 tablespoons sugar 
}i teaspoon salt 
1 teaspoon soda 



1 teaspoon cream of tartar 
1 }i cups milk 

3 tart apples, pared and 
sliced 



Mix the dry ingredients, add the milk, and beat thoroughly. Add the 
apples. Pour into a well buttered shallow pan and bake thirty minutes or 
longer in hot oven to soften the apples. 

This could be made with dried apricots, cooked in the usual manner by 
soaking and cooking slowly, and adding a little sugar. The juice may be 
used as sauce. 

This serves six or eight people. 



To the housekeeper who believes in 
conservation of time as well as of food,

nMU DO NOT WASTE FATS NOT EATEN WITH MEAT

The food animals of the Allies have decreased by 
33,000,000 head since the war began; thus the 
source of their meat production is decreasing

2 cups sour milk 
2 tablespoons butter 
2 tablespoons sugar, white w 
brown 



1^ teaspoons salt 

2 eggs 

1 teaspoon soda 

1 tablespoon coM walcr 



The meal, milk, salt, butter and sugar are cooked in a double boiler for 
about ten minutes. When the mixture is cool the eggs are added, well beaten, 
and the soda dissolved in the water. The bread should be baked in a shallow 
iron or granite pan for about thirty minutes. 



Oat Meal and Corn Meal Bread 



IK cups rolled oats 
\% cups corn meal 
y2 cup brown sugar

oyer the rolled oats, salt and sugar, and let stand until lukewarm; add the 
dissolved yeast, corn meal and flour. Let rise until light. Beat well, let rise 
again, and put into pans. Bake when light. 

This combination of oat meal, corn meal au'l wheat makes a palatable 
and economical variation.

Never have we so much needed weights 
and measures in the kitchen as in these 
thrifty war days, when an ounce of waste 
equals a pound of sacrifice, perhaps, on 
the part of some soldier-man. From

the family baby a Set of Scales

itself. One shown is priced at 
$1.65. Others to $7.25.

Prepare chicken as for frying. Melt the fat in a heavy kettle, or a casser- 
ole which can be used on top of the stove. When it is hot put in the chicken, 
salt and pepper, and stir often till the chicken is brown. This will take about 
fifteen to twenty minutes. Then add the garlic and onion, which should be 
chopped together, and the green peppers, which should be sliced. When these 
are cooked add the rice and water, stir well, and when the rice is nearly done 
add the peas and chopped olives. The pimentoes should be cut into strips

Chicken and Corn Meal Croquettes 



1 cup white corn meal mush 
1 cup chopped chicken 
Few drops onion juice 



1 egg 

Salt and pepper 



Combine the ingredients, and drop by spoonfuls into hot fat. White 
corn meal may be combined very satisfactorily with other kinds of cold meat 
to make croquettes. In general, corn meal croquettes need not be egged 
and crumbed like ordinary croquettes, for the hardening of the corn meal 
on the surface of the mixture forms the necessary crust. 

This serves three people.

)4 cup thick white sauce

or shaped. Chill, shape into croquettes, roll in fine bread or cracker crumbs, 
then in egg, then crumbs again, and fry in deep fat till brown.
