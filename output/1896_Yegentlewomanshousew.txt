TO 

MY MOTHER. 



Preface. 



The difcerning Reader will fee at once 
that in this little book it has been my 
Intention to Prefent for the Edification 
of the Amiable Sex, a curfory glance at 
the table plenifhings and Domeftic cuf- 
toms of our Forebears in this country ; 
Not only of thofe whofe Fortune it was 
to partake of the delecflable Repafts ferved 
at the tables of the Opulent, but alfo of 
thofe lefs favored families, whofe homely 
Fare preferved the mean between Prodi- 
gality and Parfimony. 

Some of thefe Recipes have been col- 
ledled from quaint family Manufcripts, 
contributed by ancient Ladies, whofe 
affurances of fupport and teftimonials of 
Approbation have cheered not a little the 

vii tafk 



tafk of Accumulation. Others have been 
gathered from old and efteemed printed 
Works, often so fraught with extrava- 
gant Recipes and full of odd and fantaftic 
Meffes, meant only for the palate of the 
Gourmand, that the tafk of Selection has 
been one of exceeding Perplexity. 

It has not been my Endeavor to write 
thefe Recipes in a high polite Style, but 
rather to keep intact the choice Di6lion 
of thofe with whom they Originated, and 
to prefent thofe which illuftrate in fome 
Falhion or other the Charadleriftics of 
the laft Century, and that part of this 
previous to the general Introdu6lion of 
that Modern Abomination — an iron 
Cook-ftove. 

The Faultfinder — who perchance 
" never fhook hands with a Stewpan " — 
may fay that I have too often trefpaffed 
into Englifh fields. Thofe who have ex- 
ercifed their underftanding know of the 
Paucity of early gaftronomic Literature 
in this Country, and how many a female 
Manager, circumfcribed in her Knowl- 
edge, hailed with joy the reprint of an 

viii Englifh 



Englifti book, adapted to the Wants and 
Requirements of the American Publick. 

If the Skeptic requires further evidence 
of the Efteem in which one of the moft 
popular of Englifh books was held, let me 
quote for his Enlightenment from a Book 
on American Cookery publiftied early in 
the Century. 

" Mrs. Hannah Glafs — who hath 
done more for the happinefs of mankind 
than all the blue ftockings of this or any 
other age. There is fcarcely a civilized 
being who hath not been benefited by 
her labours in the caufe of human happi- 
nefs, and it is one of the indications of a 
bafe ungrateful world that neither ftatue 
nor monument, nay, not even a biogra- 
phy or a pudding hath been confecrated 
to her memory — Mrs. Glafs's unparal- 
leled genius as far outfliines and overtops 
that of Mrs. Hemans and other female 
venders of empty poetry, as doth a white 
fricaffee or a difh of buttered eggs exceed 
the frothy evaporations of a brain moift- 
ened by the dews of Parnaffus. What 
comparifon can there be between the falfe 

ix fentiment 



fentiment and flimfy philofophy of Ma- 
dame de Stael and the folid puddings of 
Mrs. Glafs ? Talk of an Epic poem ! 
Verily, gentle reader, it is little better 
than downright nonfenfe. There are the 
Iliad, the Odyffey, the Aeneid, the Phar- 
falia, the Argonaut, the Jerufalem Deliv- 
ered, the Paradile Loft, the Henriade, 
and the Vifion of Columber. But there 
is only one plum pudding and one Mrs. 
Glafs ! " 

This Excurfion into the "affairs of 
the mouth " of long ago is prefented 
with fome Relu6tancy in the melancholy 
profpecfi: that a Critical Publick may ex- 
pe6l to find an exhauftive Differtation on 
the Culinary art and its Appurtenances, 
where only Houfewifely hints and fome 
curiofities of old time pra6lice have been 
given. 

If perchance fome portions of the Re- 
cipes prove in pra(?i:ice not altogether a 
grievous Penance to modern organs of 
Tafte, and others Contribute fomewhat to 
the entertainment of our fair Patroneffes 
the labour will not have been in Vain.

Rules to be observed in roasting 
Meat, Poultry and Game. 

I fliall give the moft modern Fafliions 
and muft defire the Cook to order her 
Fire according to what flie has to drefs : 
if Anything very little or thin, then a 
pretty little briflc Fire, that it may be 
done quick and nice ; if a very large 
Joint, then be Sure a good Fire be laid 

22 to 



to Cake. Let it be clear at the bottom : 
and when your Meat is half done move 
the Dripping-pan and Spit a little from 
the Fire and Stir up a good brifk Fire : 
for according to the Goodnefs of your 
Fire, your Meat will be done fooner or 
later. Take great Care the Spit be very 
clean, and be fure and clean it with 
nothing but Sand and Water, wafh it 
clean and wipe it with a dry Cloth : for 
Oil, Brick-duft and Such things will 
Spoil your Meat. 



To Roajl Never roafl a Piece 
Beef, of Beef in the Oven. 
No Meat is fo much injured 
as Beef by roafting in an Oven. 
Sprinkle Salt upon the Beef 
when it is put upon the Spit, 
and rub it in with your Hand, 
then dredge it with Flour, put 
Water into the Pan with a 
little Salt, and place the whole 
before a moderate Fire for Fif- 
teen or twenty Minutes, turn- 
ing every Part to the Fire in 

23 




order 



order that the Salt and Flour may be in- 
corporated with the Juices of the Meat ; 
then quicken your Fire and place the 
Beef clofe before it ; as faft as the Beef 
browns, bade and dredge it, turning the 
Spit as often as neceffary until the Meat 
is cooked. 

To broil Take your Beef Steaks and 
Beef beat them with the Back of a 
Steaks. Knife, ftrew them over with a 

little Pepper, 
and Salt, lay 
them on a 
Gridiron over 
a clear Fire, turning them till they are 
enough ; fet your Difh over a Chafing- 
difh of Coals, with a little brown Gravy ; 
chop an Onion fmall and put it among 
the Gravy (if your Steak be not over- 
much done. Gravy will come therefrom), 
put it on a Difh and fhake it together. 
Garnifli your Difh with Shalots and 
Pickles. 

To fry Cut your Tripe in long Pieces 
Tripe, about three inches wide, and 

24 all 




all the Breadth of the Double, put it in 
fome fmall Beer and the Yolks of Eggs ; 
Have a large Pan of good Fat, and fry 
it brown, then take it out and put it to 
drain.

The fire ftiould be kindled 
in the Oven when you make 
up the Dough. There are 
various ways of Knowing 
when the Oven is at the 
right heat. Sprinkle flour 
on the bottom, and if it 
burns quickly it is too hot. 
If you cannot hold your 
hand in to count twenty 
moderately it is hot enough. 
When ready Clear out the 
Afties and wafli the Bottom 
of oven with a wet Mop.

Obfer- Eggs keep very well when 
vations you can exclude Air, which is 
^^ '^ZZ^' beft done by placing a Grate in 
any running Water, and putting Eggs as 
the Hens lay them on the upper Side, 
then let them lie till you want to ufe 
them, when thev will be as if laid that 
Day. In Places where they may be 
ftolen, make a Cheft with Holes for the

Poached The Cook who wifties to dif- 
^ZZ^* play her Skill in poaching muft 
endeavour to procure Eggs that have been 
laid a couple of Days. Thofe that are 

yj new 



new laid are too milky. The Beauty of 
a poached Egg is for the Yolk to be 
feen blufliing through the White, which 
fhould only be juft fufficiently hardened 
to form a Tranfparent Veil for the Egg. 
This is done by carefully flipping the 
Egg into boiling Water until the White 
fets. 

Mar- Take the Yolks of twenty- 

malade four Eggs, beat them fpr an 
V^ZS^i Hour; clarify one Pound of the

Parfley, and feafon them with Pepper, 
Salt and Nutmeg. Fry it brown on the

do not turn it. Hold a hot Salamander 
over it for half a minute, to take ofi^ the 
raw Look of the Eggs. Stick curled 
Parfley in it, and ferve it up. 

Two Roajled Eggs are incomparably 

Truths better than boiled. 
concern- Never eat any Butter with 
S sS • Eggs in the Shell. You cannot 
imagine how much more you will have of

their Flavour and how much Eafier they 
will fit upon your Stomach. 

To fry Having a deep frying Pan 
^gg^ ^^ and three Pints of Clarified 

ters, and Stir it with a Stick 
till it runs round like a Whirlpool. 
Then break your Egg in the Mid- 
dle and turn it round 
with your Stick till 
it be as hard as a 
poached Egg ; the 
whirling around of 
the Butter will make it like a Ball. 
Then take it up with a Slice and fet it 
in a Difh before the Fire. So you may 
do as Many as you pleafe.

other Herbs mingle in full well felecfled

thickly fpread upon

Oil ; then they are 



enclofed in tin Boxes,

ers begin to decay, and lofe their Colour 

176 and 




and Texture. They are then removed, 
frelh flowers are added, and the Macera- 
tion repeated till the oil becomes richly 
Impregnated with the Scent of the 
flower ufed. This oil is then Put into 
a flill with Water, and the Effential oil 
comes over with the Water; or the

208 Cookery 




Cookery A few Hints to enable every 
for the Family to aflift the Poor of their 
Poor. Neighborhood. At the difcretion 
of the Miftrefs they can be varied. 

A jug of Jkimmed Milk is of good 
Value. When the Oven is 
already hot a large pudding 
may be made to be given to 
a fick or young Family 
thus. Into a deep coarfe 
Pan put half a Pound of 
Rice, four Ounces of coarfe 
Sugar or Treacle, two quarts of Milk and 
two Ounces of Scraps or top-pot, fet it 
cold in the oven. It will take a good 
while to be enough. 

A very good Meal may be beftowed 
in a thing called Brewis^ thus made. Cut 
a very thick upper cruft of Bread, and 
put it in the Pot where fait beef is near 
ready : it will attradl fome of the Fat, and 
when fwelled out, will be quite a deledl- 
able Difti to thofe who rarely tafte Meat. 

Soups, The Cook fliould fave the 

boiling of every piece of Meat, Ham and 

Tongue, however fait, and by adding 

14 209 Bones, 




Bones, barley, the Trimmings of the 
Vegetables and the odds and ends other- 
wife wafted, and by putting 
them on as foon as the din- 
ner is ferved, to fave a fecond 
fire, very nutritious Soups for 
the laborious Poor can be ob- 
tained, affording them better 
Nourifliment than they would otherwife 
get. What a Relief to the labouring 
Hufband inftead of Bread and Cheefe, 
to have a warm comfortable Meal ! to 
the fick, aged and infant branches how 
important an advantage ! nor lefs to the 
induftrious Mother, who often forbears 
that others may have a larger Share.

To Dye The Scarlet mufcle found near 
Scarlet. Bofton hath a purple Vein, 
which being prickt with a Needle yieldeth 
a perfedl fcarlet Juice, dying Linnen fo 
that no wafliing will wear it out, but keeps 
its Luftre for many Years. Handker- 
chiefs and Shirts are marked with it.

214 DreJJing 



Dreffing Tie Handsfuls of flax at both 

Flax to Ends to prevent its tangling, but 

,fJ^~ fpread out the middle as much as 
ole iiitk. ~, , , . i^ 1 I 

poflible, place m a Kettle, the 

Bottom of which has been covered with 
Straw ; coyer Flax 
with Cloth, then 
continue, covering 
each Layer of Flax 
with Cloth, until 
the Kettle be nearly 
fiill. Pour over a 
clear Lie of one 
part Lime and two 

parts wood Aihes, with due proportion of 
Water. After boiling fome hours take 
out and throw into cold Water. The 
Flax muft be then dried, hackled, beaten 
and rubbed Fine ; and dreffed firft 
through a large comb, then through a 
fine one. By this procels the Flax ac- 
quires a bright and foft Thread. 

Soap. In the city, I believe, it is bet- 

ter to exchange Alhes and Greafe for 
Soap ; but in the Country, I am certain, 
215 it 




it IS good Economy to make one's own 
Soap. If you burn Wood, you can make 
your own Lye; but the afhes of Coal is 
not worth much. Bore fmall Holes in 
the Bottom of a Barrel, place four Bricks 
around, and fill the Barrel with Afhes. 
Wet the Afhes well, but not enough to 
drop ; let it foak thus three or four Days ; 
then pour a gallon of Water in every 
hour or two, for a Day or more, and let 

it drop into a Pail or 
Tub beneath. Keep 
it dripping till the 
color of the Lye fhows the ftrength is 
exhaufted. If your Lye is not ftrong 
enough, you muft fill your Barrel with 
frefh Afhes and let the Lye run through 
it. Some people take a Barrel without 
any bottom, and lay flicks and flraws 
acrofs to prevent the Afhes from falling 
through. To make a Barrel of Soap, it 
will require about five or fix Bufhels of 
Afhes, with at leafl four quarts of un- 
flacked Stone Lime ; if flacked double 
the quantity. When you draw off a part 
of the Lye, put the Lime (whether flack 

216 or 




or not) into two or three Pails of boil- 
ing Water, and add it to the Afhes, and 
let it drain through. Three pounds of 
Greafe, fhould be put into a pail- 
ful of Lye. The great Diffi- 
culty in making Soap 'come/ 
originates in want of Judgment 
about the Strength of the Lye. 
One Rule may be fafely trufted : 
If your Lye will bear up an Egg, 
or a Potato, so you can fee a piece of the 
Surface as big as ninepence, it is juft 
ftrong enough. If it finks below the top 
of the Lye, it is too weak, and will never 
make foap ; if it is buoyed up half-way, 
the Lye is too ftrong, and that is juft as 
bad. A bit of quick-lime, thrown in 
while the Soap is boiling is of fervice. 
When the Soap becomes ropy, carry it 
down cellar in Pails and empty it into 
a barrel. It takes about twenty-four 
pounds of Greafe for a Barrel of Soap.

Econom- ^^^ ^^n either ftjr 
the purfes and

to carry to market, and they can Drive 
the Cows.

better a great deal for the Boys and Girls 
to be picking Blackberries at fix cents a 
Quart than to be wearing out their 
Clothes in fenfelefs Play. They enjoy

Something to buy Clothes at the lame 
time they are tearing them. 

Knitting. Stockings fhould be knit at 
Home, as they wear 
twice as long as woven 
Ones, and can be done 
at odd Momentswhich 
otherwise would be 
wafted. Where there

recommend Knitting
