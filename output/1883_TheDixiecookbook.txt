PEEFAOE. 



''In a multitude of counsel'' is said to be wisdom. If this be 
true of any thing, it certainly is of cookery. The present candi- 
date for favor has not been made up with the aid of the paste-pot 
and scissors, neither has it been gathered at random from doubt- 
ful sources, but has been culled, without stint of labor, time or 
expense, from the treasure-troves of hundreds of the grand old 
housekeepers of our land who have practically tested what is now 
given to others. A recipe is only valuable firom being tried and 
approved. Blunders iii cookery cost money, and it is a self-evident 
fact that a few spoiled dishes represent the price of a good cook- 
book, — ^to say nothing of the vexation and chagrin, inevitable to 
the conscientious housekeeper, resulting from any culmary failure. 

The "cook-books" and "receipt-books" of the past few years 
have numbered legion; "of making them there has seemed no 
end ;" yet too often their study and practice have proven **a wea- 
riness to the flesh," for while some of their authors were good 
book-makers, they were poor bread-makers; others, though per- 
fectly &imiliar with the subjects treated of, yet &iled to clearly 
and fully describe the processes in detail. A few lines of recipes, 
unattended by any practical instructions or suggestions, may prove 
of little utility to the mass of cooks, since to give a recipe that 
can be intelligibly understood by all b by no means an easy task. 

The lack of ordinary dishes, or those suited to the life of the 
great middle daas, has been another realized want. Fortunately 
it is becoming fashionable to economize, and housekeepers are 
really finding a pleasure and satisfaction in searching out and seek« 
ing to stop the numberless household leaks, and to exercise the 
thousand little economies which thoughtful and careful women un- 
derstand so well and practice so gracefully. 

Some one has assorted that a well-to-do French iamily will live 
on what an American household in the same condition of life throws 
away. Possibly this may not be a very great exaggeration, and 



▼i PREFACE, 

we may learn the fine art of spending money wisely, perhaps, as 
well as that of dress, from our neighbors across the water. It is 
a satis&ction to those housekeepers whose purses are not over- 
plethoric to realize that good cooking is not necessarily the most 
costly; and surely she is an artist in culinary skill who can com- 
pound a good and palatable dish from a limited larder. 

While the present volume contains recipes suited to all grades 
and styles of living, its one aim has been to pack between its covers 
the largest possible amount of practical information of real value 
to all ; and it is believed the recipes will be found to be not only 
practical, but really excellent, yet not tending to extravagance. 

The instructions preceding each department have been carefully 
given, and will be foimd entirely trustworthy; the recipes are all 
well indorsed. 

The suggestive chapters in the latter parf of the book cover a 
wide range of household subjects, and will prove of equal interest 
with the cookery department to the earnest housekeeper who readily 
seizes upon all timely hints and suggestions that may tend to simplify 
and systematize the labor of housekeeping and home-making or in 
any way help to lessen the friction of the domestic machinery. 

There has been no effort at display, the only purpose being to 
express ideas as clearly and concisely as possible, and to make a 
simple and practical work to meet the needs of earnest housekeep- 
ers of all classes. 

The arrangement of subjects treated has been made on the sim- 
ple order of the alphabet so far as practicable, and for more ready 
reference a full alphabetical index has been added — a matter that 
will be appreciated by those whose time is of value. 

It is a woman's book, compiled and sold by women, and in the 
interest of women, and will, it is believed, be fully appreciated by 
all earnest women. 

Possibly, in the effort to avoid the mistakes of otners, greater 
errors may have been committed ; but the book is submitted just 
as it is to the generous judgment and intelligent consideration of 
Southern housekeepers, with the hope that it may in some degree 
lessen their perplexities and aid them in their successful and happy 
reign in "Woman's Kingdom" — the Home.

BREAD-MAKING. 



The old saying, '* bread b the staff of life/' has sound reason in 
it Flour made from wheat, and meal from oats and Indian corn, 
are rich in the waste-repairing elements, starch and albumen, and 
head the list of articles of food for man. Good bread makes the 
homeliest meal acceptable, and the coarsest fare appetizing, while 
the most luxurious table is not even tolerable without it. Light, 
crisp rolls for breakfast, spongy, sweet bread for dinner, and flaky 
biscuit for supper, cover a multitude of culinary sins ; and there is 
no one thing on which the health and comfoi*t of a family so much 
depends as the quality of its home-made loaves. 

Opinions as to what constitutes good bread differ, perhaps, as 
much as t&sles and opinions concerning any thing else, but all will 
agree that bread, to be go#i, ought to be light, sweet — that is, free 
from any perceptible acid or yeasty taste— flaky, granular or not 
liable to become a doughy mass, and as white as the grade of flour 
used will allow. If members of the family have delicate digestive 
powers, they will not use new bread, and therefore must have such 
as will keep with little change of texture and none of quality or 
taste, for several days. To obtain these qualities in bread, use the 
be^t flour, as in families where no bread is wasted, the best is cheap 
est. The good old Genesee Valley white winter wheat, of Western 
New York, makes a flour unsurpassed in quality. The Michigan, 
Ohio, Indiana and Missouri white winter wheat grades are much 
the same, but the Minnesota hard spring wheat '^ new process** 
flour is the equal of the best, and is so much superior in strength 
that one-eighth less is used in all recipes for bread and ca,ke. The 
common or ** straight" brands are used by the great majority of 
families, and from all of them good, uniform and palatable bread 
may be made.

8 BREAD-MAKING. 

HouBekeepers seldom select flour by examination. Tliey usually 
take some tried brand, or select on the recommendation of their fur- 
nisher. No rule can be given by which an inexperienced person can 
determine the grade* of flour with accuracy, but a few hints will 
enable any one to know what not to buy. Good flour adheres to 
the hand, and, when pressed, shows the imprint of the lines of the 
skin. Its tint is cream white. Never buy that which has a blue- 
white tinge. Poor flour is not adhesive, may be blown about easily, 
and sometimes has a dingy look, as though mixed with ashes. 

Flour should be bought in quantities corresponding to the num- 
ber in the family, that it may not become damaged by long keeping. 
In a family of five, a barrel, or even a half-barrel sack of flour, 
excellent when first bought, will become much deteriorated before 
being used up. A small family should always buy in twenty-five 
pound, or at largest, fifty pound sacks. Flour should be kept dry, 
cool and entirely l)eyond the reach of marauders, big or little, 
especially the latter, for the infinitesimal meal moth is &r more to 
be dreaded than rats or mice. Therefore every receptacle of flour 
should be thoroughly and frequently cleansed, to guard against ani- 
mal as well as vegetable parasites. A single speck of mold, coming 
from old or damp flour in an obscure cft-ner of the flour-box, will 
leaven the whole as rapidly and strongly as ten times its weight in 
yeast. In no event should flour be used without being sifted. 

Bread-making seems a simple process enough, but it requires a 
delicate care and watcafulness, and a thorough knowledge of all 
the contingencies of tl e process, dependent on the different qualities 
of flour, and the varying kinds and conditions of yeast, and the 
change of seasons ; the process which raises bread successfully in 
winter making it sour in summer. There are many little things in 
bread-making which require accurate observation, and, while valu- 
able recipes and well-defined methods in detail are. in valuable aids, 
nothing but experience will secure the name merited by so few, 
though earnestly coveted by every practical, sensible housekeeper — 
"an excellent bread-maker." Three things are indispensable to 
success: good flour, good yeast, and watchful care. Never use 
flour withodt sifting ; and a large tin or wooden pail with a tight- 
fitting cover, kept full of sifted flour, will be found a great conven- 



BREAD-MAKING. 9 

fence. All kinds of flour and meal, except buckwheat and Graham — 

and Graham, too, when coarse — ^need sifting, and all, like wheat 

flour, should be bought in small quantities, as they become damp 

and musty by long standing. 

The Yeast. 

After the flour, the yeast or leaven is the next essential element 

in bread. For regular fare most, especially women, prefer "yeast 

bread," but men who can not forget ** how their mother used to 

cook," have a liking for "salt-rising" bread, and the latter deserves 

the acquaintance of the housekeeper and a :&equent welcome on 

the family table. The dry hop yeast, such as Twin Bros. , Stratton's, 

National, Eagle, Gillett's, and many others, are all good, if iresh, 

and always available, for they are found in every grocery. Many 

housekeepers use baker's yeast, and buy for a penny or two what 

will serve each baking of bread. Potato yeast has two advantages 

over other kinds ; bread made from it keeps moist longer, and there 

is no danger that an excess of yeast will injure the flavor of the 

bread. 

The Sponge. 

This is made from warm water or milk, yeast and flour (some add 
mashed potatoes) mixed tqpether in the proportion of one pint wet- 
ting (water or milk) to two pints of sifted flour. If milk is used 
it should be new, and must be first scalded, and then cooled to blood 
neat. The scaiaing lenas lo prevent souring, xii uvixig waier onng 
it to blood heat. If the ** wetting" is too hot, the bread will be 
coarse. When water is used a tablespoon* of lard or butter makes 
the bread more tender. Bread made from milk is, of course, more 
tender and nutritious, but it has not the sweet taste of the wheat, 
and will not keep as long as that made from water. When mixed 
with milk it requires less flour and less kneading. In summer, care 
must be taken not to set sponge too early, at least not before eight 
or nine o'clock in the evening. (Sponge mixed with bran water, 
warm in whiter and cold in summer, makes sweeter bread. Boil 
bran in the proportion of one pint to a quart of water and strain.) 
In very hot weather, sponge may be made with cold water. Is 
winter, mix the batter with water or milk, at blood warmth, testing

it with the finger, and making it as warm as can be borne ; stir in 
the flour, which will cool It sufficiently for the yeast ; cover closely 
and place in a warm and even temperature. A good plan is to fold 
a clean blanket several times, and cover with it, providing the 
sponge is set in a very large crock or jar, so that there is no danger 
of its running over. As a general rule, one small tea-cup of yeast 
and three pints of "wetting" will make sponge enough for four 
ordinary loaves. In all sponges add the yeast last, making sure that 
the sponge is not hot enough to scald it; when placed to rise, 
always cover closely. In cold weather the temperature runs down very 
quickly, in many kitchens, after the fire is out, and the bread should 
be set earlier in the evening, and in a warmer place; a temperature 
of eighty or ninety degrees is right. When it rises well for the first 
two hours, it will go on rising unless the temperature falls below the 
freezing point. It is an improvement to beat the sponge thoroughly, 
like batter for a cake, for fifteen minutes. Never set sponge in tin, 
but always in stoneware, because a more steady and uniform heat 
can be maintained in a stone jar than in tin. 

TO MAKE GOOD BREAD, 

Always be 

" Up in Uie morning early, just atThe peep of day," 

in summer time, to prevent the sponge becoming sour by too long 
standing, and in winter to be getting materials warmed and in readi- 
ness for use. A large, seamless tin dish-pan with handles and a 
tight-fitting cover, kept for this purpose alone, is better than a 
wooden bowl for bread. It should be thoroughly washed and 
scalded every time it is used. Measure and siit the flour. It is 
convenient to keep two quart cups, one for dry and the other for 
liquid measuring. In winter always warm the flour (by placing it in 
a pan in a vHirm oven for a few minutes or by setting it over night 
where it will be kept at the same temperature as the sponge) and also 
the sponge. Put the flour in a bread pan , make a large well in the cen- 
ter, into which pour the sponge, adding two level tea-spoons of salt (this 
is the quantity for four loaves of bread) ; mix well, being careful not 
to get the dough too stiff; turn out on the bread-board, rub the pan 
clean, and add the "rubbings" to the bread. Knead for from 
forty-five minutes to one hour, or until the dough ceases to stick to 



BREAD-MAKINQ, 11 

either the board or hands. Do not stop kneading until done. Any 
pause in the process injures the bread. The process of kneading is 
very important. Use just as little flour in kneading as will prevent 
sticking, and practice will enable one to make a little flour go a 
great way. Some good bread-makers knead with the palm of the 
hands until the dough is a flat cake, then fold once, repeating this 
operation until the dough is perfectly smooth and elastic ; others 
zloae the hands} and press hard and quickly into the dough with the 
fists, dipping them into the flour when the dough sticks; or, after 
kneading, chop with the chopping knife and then knead again; 
others still knead with a potato-masher, thinking it a great saving 
of strength. Another method, used by good bread-makers, is to 
raise the whole mass and drop or dash it with considerable force upon 
the mixing-board or table for several minutes. No exact directions 
can be given, but experience and practice will prove the best guides. 
After the bread is thoroughly kneaded, form into a round mass or 
large loaf, sprinkle the bread-pan well with flour, and, having 
placed the loaf in it, sprinkle flour lightly on the top (some grease 
the top with salted lard or butter instead of sprinkling with flour) ; 
cover closely, and set to rise in a warm temperature ; let it rise to 
twice its original size this time, say firom one to two hours, difi*ering 
in time with the season of the year. Then knead down in the pan, 
cut into equal parts, place one at a time on the board, mold each 
into a smootri, oblong loaf, not too large, ana put one arter anotner 
into a well-greased baking-pan ; grease the tops of the loaves with 
salted lard or butter, and set to rise. Or the loaves may be made 
by buttering the hands, and taking enough from the mass to form 
a loaf, molding it into shape in the hands, without using flour. This 
insures a nice, brown, tender crust Loaves made in the French 
style, long and narrow, are about half crust, and more easily di- 
gested, the action of heat antici})atiug part of the digestive process. 
In molding, do not leave any lumps or loose flour adhering to the 
outside, but mold until the loaves are perfectly Smooth. No par- 
ticular directions can be given in regard to the time bread should 
stand after it is molded and placed in the pans, because here is uie 
point where observation and discretion are so indispensable. In hot 
weather, when the yeast is very good and the bread very light, it 



12 BREAD-MAKING. 

must not stand over fifteen minutes before placing to bake. If it is 
cold weather, and the yeast is less active, or the bread not perfectly 
raised, it may sometimes stand an hour in the pans without injury. 
When it is risen so as to seam or crack, it is ready for the oven ; if 
it stands after this it becomes sour, and even if it does not sour it 
loses its freshness and sweetness, and the bread becomes dry sooner 
after baking. Bread should undergo but two fermentations; the 
saccharine or sweet fermentation, and the vinous, when it smells 
something like foaming beer. The housewife who would have good, 
sweet bread, must never let it pass this change, because the third 
or acetous fermentation then takes place. This last can be remedied 
by adding soda m the proportion of one tea-spoon to each quart of 
wetting ; or, which is the same thing, a tea-spoon to four quarts of 
flour; but the bread will be much less nutritious and healthful, and 
some of the best elements of the flour will be lost. Always add 
salt to all bread, biscuit, griddle-cakes, etc., but never salt sponge. 
A small quantity of white sugar is an improvement to all bread 
dough. Bread should always be mixed as soft as it can he handled^ 
but in using the "new process*' flour, made from spring wheat, the 
dough requires to be much harder than is necessary when using that 
made from winter wheat 

To Bake Bread. 

Here is the important point, for the bread may be perfect thus 
far and then be spoiled in baking. No definite rules can be i^ven 
that apply equally well to every stove and range ; but one general 
rule must be observed, which is, to have a steady, moderate heat, 
such as is more minutely described in the directions for baking large 
cakes. The oven must be just hot enough ; if too hot, a firm crust 
is formed before the bread has expanded enough, and it will be 
heavy. To test the heat, place a teaspoon of flour on an old piece 
of crockery (to secure an even heat), and set in middle of the oven ; 
if it browns in one minute the heat is right. An oven in which the 
bare hand and arm can not be held longer than to count twenty 
moderately, is hot enough. The attention of stove-makers seems 
aever to have been directed to the &ct that there is no accurate 
means of testing the heat of ovens, but it is to be hoped that in the 



BREAD-MAKINO. 13 

near ftiture some simple device may be fbuDd which will render 
mmeoessaiy such inaccurate and untrustworthy tests as must now be 
used, and thus reduce baking to a science. To test whether the 
bread is done, break the loaves apart and press gently with 
the finger ; if elastic it is done, but if clammy, not done, and must 
be returned to the oven ; or, if the loaves are single, test with a 
straw plucked from a broom. Break off the branches and thrust 
the larger end into the loaf; if it is sticky when withdrawn, the 
bread is not done, but if free from dough it is ready to be removed 
fi'om the oven. The little projections on the straw, where the 
branches have been broken off, catch and bring out the dough, 
when not thoroughly baked. 

The time required for baking is not less than three-quarters of an 
hour, and bread baked a full hour is more wholesome and is gen- 
erally considered more palatable. ''The little fairy that hovers 
over successful bread-making is heat, not too little nor too much, 
but uniform." 

When removed from the oven, take the loaves out of the pan, 
grease the entire outer crust with melted butter, and tilt them on 
edge, so as to secure a free circulation of air. It is better not to 
cover bread while warm, unless with a Ught cloth to keep off flies. 
Thoroughly exposed to the air thR auvface cooh first, insuring a crisp 
crust and the retention of the moisture in the loaf. There are 
those, however, who follow successftilly the plan of wrapping the 
bread, as soon as it ia removed from the oveu. in a coarse towel or 
bread-cloth. Never put warm bread next to wood, as the part in 
contact will have a bad taste. Spread a cloth over the table before 
placing the bread on it 

Good bread-makers differ widelv as to the number of times bread 
should rise, some insisting that the rgle of our good grandmothers, 
who only allowed it to rise once, insures the sweetest and most nutri- 
ttoos bread, and that in all subsequent fermentations, a decomposi- 
tion takes places that is damaging to the wholesome qualities of the 
"staff of life.'* 

If by accident or neglect the bread is baked too hard, rub the 
baf over with butter, wet a towel and wrap it in it, and cover with 
another dry toweL In winter, bread dough may be kept sweet

wveral days by placing it where it will be eold without freezings or 
by putting it so deep into the flour barrel as to exclude it entirely 
firom the air. When wanted for use, make into bread, or, by add- 
ing the proper ingredients, into cake, rusk, biscuit, apple dump- 
lings, chicken pie, etc. 

When the bread u eold, place in a stone jar or tin box, which 
must be thoroughly washed, scalded and dried each baking day. A 
still better receptacle for bread is a tin wash-boiler with a close 
cover, kept for this pur|)ose alone. When smaU, single loaf pans 
are used, the bread nmy be removed to cool, the pans washed and 
dried, and the loaves afterwards replaced each in its pan, and then 
set away in a box or boiler. The pan helps to keep the bread 
moist and palatable for several days. 

The best pan for bread is made of Russia iron (which is but little 
more costly than tin and will last many times as long), about four 
by ten inches on the bottom, flaring to the top, and about four and 
one-half inches deep. The pan should be greased very lightly for 
bread. 

Attention to neatness, important in all cookery, is doubly im- 
portant in bread-making. Be sure that the hair is neatiy combed 
and put up (which ought to be done before the dress is put on 
every morning), and that the hands, arms and finger-nails are 
scrupulously clean. A neat calico apron with bib, and sleeves of 
dress well-tucked up and lastened so that they wQl not come down, 
add much to the comfort of this the most important task of the 
kitchen queen. 

There are three critical points in the process of bread-making : 
the condition of the yeast, which must never be used if sour ; the 
temperature where the bread b set to rise, which must not be so hot 
as to scald ; and the temperature of the oven, which must be uni- 
form, neither too hot nor too cold. 

In cutting warm bread for the table, heat the knife, and, whether 
hot or cold, cut only as much as will be eaten. It is better to 
replenish the bread-plate once or even twice during a meal than to 
have slices left over to dry up and waste. 

When using coal, put into the fire-box enough to finish the baking; 
adding more during the process is apt to render the oven-heat

irregalar. When wood is used, make a good hoi fire, see that the 
stove has a good, free draft, and let it cool to an even, steady heat 
before putting the bread in the oven. The finest bread may be com- 
pletely spoiled in baking, and a freshly-made fire can not be easily 
l^ulated. 

The patent iron shelves, made to be attached to the pipes of 
stoves and ranges, are very convenient places for placing bread to 
lise. They give the necessary warmth, and the height is conven- 
ient for watching. 

The proportion of gluten in wheat, and consequently in flour, 
varies greatly in different varieties. Flour in which gluten is 
abundant will absorb much more liquid than that which contains a 
greater proportion of starch, and consequently is stronger ; that is, 
will make more bread to a given quantity. Gluten is a flesh-former, 
and starch a heat-giver, in the nutritive processes of the body. 
Flour containing a good proportion of gluten remains a compact 
mass when compressed in the hand, while starchy flour crumbles 
and lacks adhesive properties. Neither gluten or starch dissolve 
m cold water. The gluten is a grayish, tough, elastic substance. 
In yeast-bread, the yeast, in fermenting, combines with the sugar in 
the flour and the sugar which has been added to the flour, and car- 
bonic acid gas and alcohol are produced. The gas tries to escape, 
but is confined by the elastic, strong gluten which forms the walls 
of the cells in which it is held, its expansion changing the solid 
dough into a light, spongy mass. The kneading process distributes 
die yeast thoroughly through the bread, making the grain even. 
The water used in mixing the bread softens the gluten, and cements 
all the particles of flour together, ready for the action of the car- 
bonic acid gas. In baking, the loaf grows larger as the heat ex- 
pands the carbonic acid gas, and converts the water into steam and 
the alcohol into vapor, but it, meantime, loses one-sixth of its weight 
by the escape of these through the pores of the bread. Some of the 
starch changes into gum, the cells of the rest are broken by the 
heat, the gluten is softened and made tender, and the bread is in 
the condition most easily acted upon by the digestive fluids. 

There is a great difierence of opinion as to the comparative mer- 
its of bread made from fine flour, and Graham, or whole wheat 



16 BREAD-MAKII^Q. 

flour. The latter is undoubtedly best for persons who lead seden- 
tary lives, as the coarse particles stimulate the digestive organs, 
causing the fluids to flow more freely ; while for those who follow 
active, out-of-door pursuits, the fine flour bread is probably best, as 
being more nutritious and economical, because wholly digested. 

Th;ere is an old and true saying, that '* she who has baked a good 
batch of bread has done a good days work." Bread-making should 
stand at the head of domestic accomplishments, since the health 
and happiness of the family depends immeasurably upon good 
bread ; and there is certain to come a time in the experience of 
every true, thoughtful woman when she is glad and proud of her 
ability to make nice, sweet loaves, firee from soda, alum, and other 
injurious ingredients, or bitter regret that she neglected to learn, 
or was so unfortunate as not to have been taught, at least the first 
requisites of good bread-making. 

Graham and Cobn Bread. 

It is very desirable that every &mily should have a constant 
supply of bread made of unbolted flour, or rye and Indian com. 
Most persons find it palatable, and it promotes health. For these 
coarse breads, always add a little brown sugar or molasses, and the 
amount given in the recipes may be increased according to taste. 
They rise quicker and in a less warm atmosphere than without 
sweetening. A little lard or butter improves bread or ca&es made 
of Graham or Indian meal, rendering them light and tender. 
Graham rises rather more quickly than fine flour (as the whole 
wheat flour contains a larger proportion of gluten, and fermentation 
is more rapid), and should not be allowed to rise quite as light. 
The pans should be greased more thoroughly for Graham and com 
bread than for that made from fine flour. The fire should be steady 
and sufficient to complete the baking, and the oven hot when the 
bread is put in. A fresh blaze wiU bum the crust, while a steady 
fire will sweeten it. Graham bread bakes more slowly than fine- 
flour bread, and com bread requires mo(e time and a hotter oven 
than either. Use either yellow or white corn, ground coarse, for 
mush, and white, ground fine, for bread, etc. In cutting the latter 
while warm, heat the knife, and hold it perpendicularly. Rye is 



BBEAD'MAKINQ. 17 

said to absorb more moisture from the air than any other grain; 

henoe, all bread from this meal needs a longer application of heat, 

and keeps moister after being baked than that made from other 

grain. 

Sponge for Winter Use. 

Peel and boil four or five medium-sized potatoes in two quarts of 
water (which wiU boil down to one quart by thet ime the potatoes 
are cooked) : when done, take out and press through a colander, or 
mash very fine in the crock in which the sponge is to be made; 
make a well in the center, into which put one cup of flour, and pour 
over tt the boiling water from the potatoes; stir thoroughly, and 
when cool add a pint of tepid water, flour enough to make a Mn 
batter, and a cup of yeast This sponge makes very moist bread. 

Bread Sponge. 

Six potatoes boiled and mashed while hot, two table-spoons of 
white sugar, two of butter, one quart tepid water; into this stir 
three cups flour; beat to a smooth batter, add six table-spoons 
yeast ; set over night, and, in the morning, knead in sufficient flour 
to make a stifi*, spongy dough ; knead vigorously for fifteen min- 
utes, set away to rise, and, when light, knead for ten minutes; mold 
out into moderate^ized loaves, and let rise until they are like deli- 
cate or light sponge-cake. — Mrs. Oeorge H. Ruet 

Bread Sponge and Bread. 

Five pints warm water, five quarts sifted flour, one cofleC'Cup 
yeast ; mix in a two-gallon stone jar, cover closely, and set in a large 
tin pan, so that if the sponge rises over the top of the jar, the 
drippings may fall into the pan. Set to rise the evening before 
baking. In winter be careful to set in a warm place. In the morn* 
ing sift six quarts flour into a pail, pour the sponge into a bread« 
pen or bowl, add two table-spoons of salt, then the flour gradually ; 
mix and knead well, using up nearly all the flour. This first 
kneading is the most important, and should occupy at least twenty 
minutes. Make the bread in one large loaf, set away in a warm 
place, and cover with a cloth. It ought to rise in half an hour, 
when it should be kneaded thoroughly again for ten minutes. Then 



Ai 



18 BREAD-MAKINQ. 

take enough dough for three good-sized loaves (a quart bowl of dough 
to each), give five minutes kneading to eiich loaf, and place to rise 
in a dripping-pan well greased with lard. The loaves will be light 
in five or ten minutes, and wUl bake in a properly heated oven in 
half an hour. Make a well in the center of the remaining dough, 
and into it put a half tea-cup of white sugar, one tea-cup of lard, 
and two eggs, which mix thoroughly with the dough, knead into 
one large loaf, set in a warm place about fifteen minutes to rise, and, 
when light, knead five minutes and let rise again for about ten 
minutes, when it should be light. Take out of pan, and knead on 
bread-board, roll about an inch in thickness, cut out with a biscuit* 
cutter, and place in dripping-pan ; let rise five minutes and bake 
twenty minutes. In winter more time must be allowed for rising. 
This makes three loaves and ninety biscuit. 

Bread with Buttermilk. 

The evening before baking, bring to the boiling point two quarts 
of buttermilk (or boil sour milk and take the same quantity of the 
whey), and pour into a crock in which a scant tea-cup of sifted flour 
has been placed. Let stand till sufficiently cool, then add half a 
cup of yeast, and flour to make a thick batter ; the better and 
longer the sponge is stirred the whiter will be the bread. In the 
morning siffc the flour into the bread-pan, pour the sponge in the 
center, stir in some of the flour, and let stand until after break- 
fast ; then mix, kneading for about half an hour, the longer the 
better ; when light, mold into loaves, this time kneading as little as 
possible. The secret of good bread is having good yeasl^ and not 
baking too hard. This makes four loaves and forty biscuit. — Mn. 
M, G. MooTCy 

Good Bread. 

For four small loaves boil four large potatoes ; when done, pour 
off the water, and when it cools add to it a yeast cake ; mash the 
potato very fine, put through a sieve, pour boiling milk on as much 
flour as i& needed, let stand until cool, add the potato and yeast, a 
large tearspoon of salt and one table-spoon of sugar ; stir very stiff, 
adding flour as is needed. Let stand in a warm place until light, 



BREAD-MAKING, 19 

dissolve one tea-spoon of soda in' a little hot water, mix well through 
with the hands, mold into loaves, and let rise again. When suffi- 
ciently raised place in a moderately hot oven, keeping up a steady 
fire. — Mrs. Ctcvemor Hardin, Missouri. 

Hop- Yeast Bread. 

One tea-cup yeast, three pints warm water; make a thin sponge 
at tea time, cover and let it remain two hours or until very light. 
By adding the water to the dour iirst and having the sponge quite 
warm, it is never necessary to put the sponge over hot water or in 
an oveu to make it rise. Knead into a loaf before going to bed ; in 
the morning mold into three loaves, spreading a little lard between 
as they are put in the pan. When light, bake one hour, having 
oven quite hot when the bread is put in, and very moderate when 
it is done. (Bread made in this way is never sour or heavy.) To 
have fine, light biscuit, add shortening at night, and in the morning 
make into biscuit and bake for breakfast. By this recipe bread is 
baked befoi'e the stove is cold from breakfast, and out of the way 
for other baking. 

To cool bread there should be a board for the purpose. An oaken 
board, covered with heavy white flannel, is the best ; over this spread 
a fresh linen bread-cloth, and lay the bread on it right side up, with 
Bothing over it except a very thin cover to keep off the flies. It 
should be placed immediately in the firesh air or wind to cool ; when 
cool, place immediately in a tin box or stone jar, and cover closely. 
Br^d cooled in this way will have a soft crust, and be filled with 
pure air. — Mrs J. T, Liggett, Detroit, 

Bread with Potato Sponge. 

 

Pare and boil four or five potatoes, mash fine, and add one pint 
of flour; pour on the mixture first boiling water enough to moisten 
well, then about one quart of cold water, after which add flour 
enough to make a stiff batter. When cooled to ** scarcely milk 
warm," put in one-half pint (or more will do no harm) of yeast, 
and let it stand in a warm place over night ; in the morning add to 
this sponge one cup of lard, stir in flour, and knead well. The 
more kneading the finer and whiter the bread will be ; pounding 
also with a potato-masher improves the bread greatly, and is rather 



20 BREAD-MAKINQ, 

easier than so much kneading. When quite stiff and well worked 
and pounded, let it rise again, and when light, nmke into loaves or 
biscuit, adding no more flour except to flour the hands and board — 
merely enough to prevent the bread from sticking. Let it rise 
again, then bake; and immediately after taking from the oven, 
wrap in a wet towel until partly cold, in order to soften the crust. 
If yeast and ^Zour are good (esserUiala in all cases), the above process 
will make good bread. — Mrs. Clara Morey 

Poor-Man's Bread. 

One pint of buttermilk or sour milk, one level tea-spoon soda, a 

pinch of salt, and flour enough to make as stiff as soda-biscuit dough ; 

cut into three pieces, handle as little as possible, roll an inch thick, 

place in dripping-pan, bake twenty or thirty minutes in a hot oven, 

and, when done, wrap in a bread cloth. Eat while warm, breaking 

open like a biscuit. Each cake will be about the size of a pie. — 

Mn, D. B. 

Bread wriH Potatoes. 

To one quart of blood-warm water or milk (if milk is used, it 
must first be scalded and then cooled to blood heat), take two quarts 
sifted flour and one teacup fresh potato yeast. Put the milk or 
water into a one-gallon stone crock and stir the flour gradually into 
it, then add the yeast, beating it vigorously for fift;een minutes ; set 
to rise in a warm place, putting the crock in a pan (to catch the 
drippings if it should run over). If in winter, mix it as early as 
SIX or seven o'clocK in tne evenmg. Cover very closely wfth a 
clean white cloth, with a blanket over it, kept purposely for this 
(the cloths used for bread should not be taken for any thing else). 
In the morning, sift three quarts of flour into the bread-pan, setting 
it in the oven for a few minutes to bring it to the same temperature 
as the sponge. Pare six medium-sized potatoes, and boil them in 
three pints of water ; when thoroughly cooked, remove the potatoes 
and pour the boiling hot water (which will now be about one quart) 
over the flour, stirring it with a spoon. Mash the potatoes very 
fine, and beat them as if for the table; mix them in the flour, and 
when cooled to blood heat, pour in the sponge, and mix well. Add 
more wetting or flour if needed, rub off all that adheres to the sides 



BREAD-MAKINQ. 21 

of the pan, and mix with the dough, kneading it from forty-five 
minutes to one hour ; then place the pan to rise, cover closely with 
the cloth and blanket, setting it where there is no draft (this is im* 
perative). When it has risen to twice its size, knead down in the 
pan, take one quart of dough for each loaf, knead each five min- 
utes with quick, elastic movements, grease tlie sides of the loaves 
with sweet, melted butter if two or more are placed in the same 
pan ; or the loaves may be greased all over lightly before placing in 
the pan, a process which adds much to the sweetness of the crust. 
The pan should be thoroughly but lightly greased. Let rise until 
as large again as when molded, then bake. Have your oven mod- 
erately heated at first, with a fire in the stove that will keep it of a 
uniform temperature. (For manner of testing oven, see general 
instructions for bread-making.) Bake from three-quarters of an 
hour to one hour and a quarter, according to the size of the loaves, 
during which time the bread should be carefully watched to see that 
the proper degree of heat is steadily kept up. Before browning 
they will have risen to double their size when placed in the oven. 
The heat of the oven is all important, for if too hot the loaves will 
not rise sufficiently; if too cold they will rise too much, and the 
bread will be coarse and porous. When done, place on side, and 
oool without covering. Never use flour without sifting, as sifting 
enlivens and serates the flour, and makes both mixing and rising 
easier and quicker. Quick rising makes whiter bread, and it is veiy 
necessary that in all its diflerent risings, bread should be mixed M 
soon as ready. — Auldafi, Siieboygan, Me. 

Bread Raised Once. 

No other yeast is made with so little trouble as potato yeast 
Bread made fr^m it keeps moist longer, and there is no danger of 
injuring the flavor of the bread by using too much. When plen- 
tifully used, a beautiful, light, sweet, fine-grained bread is produced 
by only one rising, thus saving not only time and trouble, but also, 
what is more important, the sweet flavor and nutritious qualities 
which greatly sufler by the second fermentation, almost universally 
practiced. When this fact is thoroughly understood, every one will 
appreciate the importance of checking excessive fermentationy dur- 



22 BREAD-MAKINQ. 

ing which decomposition actually takes place, and the delicate^ 
foamy loaves, *' yeasted to death/' which so many families now use 
and call the '* staff of life/' will give place to the sweet, substantial 
home-made loaves, such as our good mothers and grandmothers 
kneaded with their own skilled hands. 

Take care that the yeast is good and ** lively," for, without this, 
failure is certain. To make three loaves of bread, warm and lightly 
grease the baking-pans, sift three quarts or more of dour into the 
bread-pan, press down the middle, and into it put two small table- 
spoons of fine salt ; pour in slowly one quart of milk-warm water, 
constantly stirring with one hand in the flour, until a thin batter is 
formed; add a pint or more of potato yeast or one tea-cup of hop 
yeast. (If compressed yeast is used, a yeast cake, dissolved in 
warm water, or a piece of compressed yeast as large as a walnut, 
dissolved in the same manner, is sufRciont.) Mix thoroughly, add- 
ing more and more flour, until a stiff dough is formed; place on 
the bread-board, knead vigorously for twenty minutes or more, 
flouring the board frequently to prevent the dough from sticking to 
it, divide into loaves of a size to suit pans, mold into a comely 
shape, place in pans, rub over the top a light coating of sweet, 
drawn butter, set in a warm, not too hot place to rise, cover lightly 
to keep off dust and air, watch and oc^casionally turn the pans 
around when necessary to make the loaves rise evenly ; when risen 
to about double the original size, draw across the top of each length- 
wise with a sharp knife, making a slit half an inch deep, place 
them in a moderately heated oven, and bake one hour, watching 
carefully from time to time to make certain that a proper degree of 
heat is kept up. Before browning they will rise to double the size 
of loaf which was placed in the oven, and pans must' be provided 
deep enough to retain them in shape. Bake until well done and 
nicely browned. Nothing adds morf to the sweetness and digesti' 
bility of wheaten bread than thorough baking. When done, re^ 
move from pans immediately, to prevent the sweating and softening 
of the crust — Mn, L. B, Lyman, Antioch, CaL 



BBEAD-MAKINQ. 23 

Brkad Raised Twice. 

Measure oat four quarts of sifted flour, take out a pint in a cup, 
and place remainder in a bread-pan. Make a well in the middle, 
into which turn one table-spoon sugar, one of salt, and one cup of 
jeast; then mix in one pint of miJk which has been made blood- 
warm by adding one pint of boiling water ; beat well with a strong 
spoon, add one table-spoon lard, knead for twenty to thirty minute?, 
and let rise over night; in the morning knead again, make into 
loaves, let them rise one hour, and bake fifty minutes. Water may 
be used instead of the pint of milk, in which case use twice as much 
lard. 

Bread Raised Three Times. 

Begin about 5 p. m., plan for six loaves, somewhat larger than 
bakers' loaves ; take two little cakes of yeast, put them into a pint 
of tepid water, and, when soft, beat in thoroughly enough flour to 
make a thick batter, and put in a warm place. If the excellent 
"Farmer's Yeast," the recipe for which is given hereafter, is used, 
take half a tea-cup and stir into the batter. A good dish for this 
purpose is a large bowl, a broad open pitcher, or a bright three- 
quart tin pail, and it should be clean in the strictest sense. This 
should rise in about two hours; and when nearly light, take six or 
eight medium-sized potatoes, pare neatly, rinse clean, and boil in 
three pints of water till well done, mash very fine in the water 
while hot. Have ready a bread-pan of sifted flour, into which put 
a tea-spoon of salt, half a cup of white sugar, and a bit of lard as 
large as an egg ; then riddle the potato mash, hot as it is, 'through 
a sieve or fine colander into the flour, and stir with a kitchen spoon 
into a stifl* dough. This scalds about half the flour used in the 
batch of bread. This mass must cool till it wiU not scald ihe yeast, 
which may now be mixed in md put in a warm, not hot, place for 
second rising, which will be accomplished by morning, when the 
kneading may be done. Kneading is the flnest point of bread-mak- 
ing, and contains more of the art than any other; it requires skiU, 
time, patience, and hard work. Work in flour no faster than is re- 
quired to allow thorough kneading, which can not be done in less 
tban forty-five minutes, but should not be worked much over an 



24 BREAD-MAKINO, 

hour; one hour is a good uniform rule. The mechanical bakers 
use sets of rollers driven by steam power, between which the dough 
is passed, coming out a sheet an inch thick; it is folded together 
several times and rolled again and again. This process should be 
imitated somewhat by the hands in the family kitchen. The work- 
ing of the dough gives grain and flakiness to tlie bread. The dough 
when kueaded should be soft, but not sticky — stiff enough to retain 
its roundness on the board. Put back into the pan for the third 
rising, which will require but little time, and when light, cut off 
enough for each loaf by itself. Knead but little, and put into the 
baking-pans. If the first kneading has been well done, no more 
flour will be needed in molding into loaves. These must remain in 
the baking-pans till nearly as large as the loaves ought to be, when 
they may be put into a well-heated oven. If the oven is a trifle 
too hot, or if it tends to bake hard on the top, a piece of brown 
paper may be put over the loaves (save some clean grocer's paper 
for this purpose), and from forty to sixty minutes will cook it thor- 
oughly. After the loaves are put into the baking-pans, avoid jar- 
ring them, as it will make portions of them heavy. 

If the yeast is '* set" at 5 p. M., the bi^ad will be ready for 
dinner next day ; if in the morning, the baking will be done early 
in the evening, or twelve hours after, with fair temperature and 
good yeast. Bread made lu this way will be good for a week,* and, 
with fair weather and careful keeping, even two weeks. When 
dry, a slice toasted will be as crisp, sweet, and granular as Yan- 
kee ginger-bread. — Mrs, H. Young, 
» 

Bread, in Summer or Wintep. 

In summer take three pints of cold or tepid water, four table^ 
spoons of yeast, one tea-spoon of salt ; stir in flour enough to make 
a thick sponge (rather thicker than griddle-cakes). Let stand until 
morning, then add more flour, m\if stiff, and knead ten minutes; 
place in a pan, let rise until light, knead for another ten minutes; 
mold into four loaves, and set to rise, but do not let it get too light; 
bake in a moderate oven one hour. If bread is mixed at six o'clock 
in the morning, the baking ought to be done by ten o'clock. 

In winter take one pint of buttermilk or clabbered milk ; let it 



BREAD-MAKINQ. 25 

ecald (not boil) ; make a well in the center of the flour, into it turn 
the hot milk, add one tea-spoon of salt, enough flour and water to 
make sufficient sponge, and one tea-cup of yeast; let stand until 
morning, and then prepare the bread as in summer. This is more 
convenient to make in winter, since a hot fire is needed to heat the 
milk. — Mrs. £>. Bvxton, 

Salt-Rising Bread. 

The leaven for this bread is prepared thus : Take a pint of warm 
water — about 90° — (if a little too hot defeat is certain) in a per- 
fectly clean bowl and stir up a thick batter, adding only a tea-spoon 
of salt; a thorough beating of the batter is important. Set in a 
pan of warm water to secure uniformity of temperature, and in 
two to four hours it will begin to rise. The rising is much more 
sure if coarse flour or '* shorts" is used instead of fine flour. 

When your '* rising" is nearly light enough, take a pint of milk 
and a pint of boiling water, (a table-spoon of lime water added is 
good, and often prevents souring), mix the sponge in the bread-pan, 
and when cooled to about milk-warm, stir in the rising. The 
sponge thus made will be light in two to four hours, with good 
warmth. The dough requires less kneading than yeast-raised dough. 
The bread is simpler, but not so certain of rising, and you leave 
out all the ingredients save the flour, water (milk is not essential), 
and a pinch of salt. It should be made more frequently as it dries 
&ster than bread containing potatoes. Some object to it because of 
the odor in rising, which is the result of acetous fermentation, but 
the more of that the more sure you are of having sweet bread when 
baked. — Mrs. H, Youngs 

•Another Salt-Risino Bread. 
In summer take at night one (scant) pint of new milk, half as 
much hot water, a teanspoon salt, one of sugar, and a very little soda. 
Mix all in a nice, sweet piich^r (it must be perfectly clean and 
sweet), stir in one table-spoon of corn meal, and add flour enough 
to make a medium batter; stir well, place the pitcher in an iron 
kettle with quite warm water, using so much water that the pitcher 
will barely rest on the bottom of the kettle ; cover closely and leave 
all night (on the stove if the fire is nearly out) where it will be 



26 BBEAD-MAKINQ, 

kept warm, not hot, for an hour or two. If the pitcher is not too 
large, it will probably be full in the morning; if not, add a spoon 
of flour, stir well, warm the water in the kettle, replace the 
pitcher, cover, and keep it vxirm until light Have ready two 
quarts of sifted flour in a pan, make a hole in the center, put in an 
even tea-spoon of salt, a tea-cup of nearly boiling water ; add one 
pint of new milk, and stir a batter there in the center of the flour, 
/iddthe "emptyings" from the pitcher, and stir well (there will be a 
good deal of flour all round the batter ; this is right) ; cover with 
another pan, keep warm until light — ^it will rise in an hour or even 
less — when it is ready to be weO, kneaded, and made directly into 
loaves, which place in the baking-pans, keep well covered and vxirm 
until light, when it is ready to bake. The secret of success is to 
keep it warm but not at all liot. This bread is good if no milk is 
used ; indeed, some prefer it made with water alone instead of milk 
and water. In cold weather, if kitchen is cold at night, do not set 
. "emptyings** over night, but make early in the morning. — JBavillah^

Boston Brown Bread. 
One heaping coffee-cup each of corn, rye and Graham meal. 
The rye meal should be as fine as the Graham, or rye flour may be 
used. Sift the three kinds together as closely as possible, and beat 
together thoroughly with two cups New Orleans or Porto Kico mo- 
lasses, two cups sweet milk, one cup sour milk, one dessert-spoon 
soda, one tea-spoon salt; pour into a tin form, place in a kettle of 
cM water, put on and boil four hours. Put on to cook as soon as 
mixed. It may appear to be too thin, but? it is not, as this recipe 
has never been known to fail. Serve warm, with baked beans or 
Thanksgiving turkey. The bread should not quite fill the form 
(or a tin pail with cover will answer), as it must have room to swell. 
See that the water does not boil up to the top of the form; also 
take care it does not boil entirely away or stop boiling. To serve 
it, remove the lid and set it a few moments into the open oven to 
dry the top, and it will then turn out in perfect shape. This bread 
can be used as a pudding, and served with a sauce made of thick 
nour cream, well sweetened and seasoned with nutmeg; or it is good 
toasted the next day. — Mn. H. S. Stevem, Minneapolis, Minn.

Bread with Mush. 

Four two quarts hot corn-meal mush, made as for eating, over 
two quarts flour (wheat or Graham) ; when cool, add one quart 
sponge, one coflfee-cup molasses, one tearspoon salt, half tearspoon 
soda; mix well together; add more flour if needed, and knead 
thoroughly; mold into small loaves; let rise and bake in small 
dripping pans (a loaf in a pan), or pie-tins, in a moderate oven; 
when done, rub over with butter, place on the side, wrap in a cloth, 
and when cold put in a jar or box. This recipe makes three good- 
sized loaves and keeps moist longer than all Graham bread. — Mn.

Corn Bread. 

Take one quart buttermilk, and one heaping pint corn meal, one 
tea-spoon soda, one of salt, one table-spoon sugar and three eggs ; 
have the stove very hot, and do not bake in too deep a pan. The 
batter seems too thin, but bakes very nicely. — 3frs. J. H. Shearer,

pan, and place in a moderate oven. When nearly done, remove the 

cover, and bake slowly until done. Excellent when cold. 

All baking-pans for bread should be made with covers, made of 

the same material, and high enough to permit the bread to rise to 

its Aill size. If pan is deep enough to permit the bread to rise 

without touching it, a flat piece of tin or sheet-iron will answer for 

the cover, or a cover may be made of paper, or another pan may 

be inverted over the bread. The office of the cover is to prevent 

the crust from browning hard before the expansion of the gases has 

made the bread light and porous. — Mrs. C. V. OoUier, Liidifiddj

BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. 



To make biscuit, take a part of the dough left from bread-making 
when it is ready to mold into loaves, work in the lard and any other 
ingredients desired, such as butter, eggs, sugar, spice, etc., also 
using a little more flour ; let rise once, then mix down and let rise 
again, turn out on "iie bread-board, knead a few minutes, roll, and 
cut out with a biscuit-cutter or mold with the hand. Place in a 
well-greased dripping-pan, and when light bake in a quick oven 
from fifteen to twenty minutes. To make them a nice color, wet 
the top with warm water just before placing in the oven. To glaze, 
brush lightly with milk and sugar, or the well-beaten yolk of an egg 
sweetened, and a little milk added. 

Biscuit may be baked in eight minutes by making the oven as 
hot as can be without burning, and allowing it to cool off gradually 
as they bake ; this makes them very light, but one has to watch 
closely to keep them from being scorched. Any kind of bread or 
pastry mixed with water requires a hotter fire than that mixed \rith 
milk. 

Biscuit and rolls should be allowed to rise one-half longer than 
bread loaves, because the loaves of the former, being smaller, are 
penetrated sooner by the heat, and, of course, the fermentation is 
stopped sooner, and the rolls do not rise so much in the oven. ^ 

Biscuit for tea at six must be molded two hours before, which 
will give ample time for rising and baking. Parker House rolls for 
break&st at eight must be made ready at five. Many think it 



82 BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. 

UDDecessarj to knead dowu either bread or biscuit as often as hero 
directed ; but if attention is given to the dough at the right time, 
and it is not suffered to become too lights it will be much nicer, 
whiter, and of a finer texture if these directions are followed. 

The almost universal custom is to set the sponge at night, but 
many excellent bread-makers differ widely from this in practice, and 
their objections deserve candid consideration in this nineteenth cen- 
tury, when so much is written of dyspepsia and its causes. Some 
medical authorities assert that cancer in the stomach has its origin 
in dyspepsia, which, in the beginning, is caused by the use of indi- 
gestible yeast bread, in which the process of fermentation has been 
allowed to go so far that a certain amount of actual decomposition 
has taken place. This is not the fault of such recipes as are giveu 
in this volume, but from &ilure to mix the bread at each suc- 
cessive rising at ihe proper time. The objection to setting sponge 
at night is, that it stands too long. Bread, to be white, sweet, and . 
digestible, must be mixed immediately after the sponge has risen to 
the proper point, which may be known by Us puffy appearance, usvuiUy 
rising higJier in the middle titan at Hie sides of ihe crock ; if it sinks in 
the center, it has stood too long. 

The process of bread-making discovered by Prof. Horsford, of 
Harvard College, deserves the attention of all housekeepers. It is 
claimed, and with good reason, that the Horsford process prevents 
all decomposition, saves all the nutritious properties of the bread, 
and, by the addition of acid phosphate, renders it more easy of 
digestion. Besides this, the use of Horsford's Bread Preparation 
saves times, simplifies the whole process of bread-making, saves 
labor, and reduces the chances of failure to the minimum. These 
are considerations of great moment, especially to inexperienced 
housekeepers, leaving entirely out of consideration the fact that this 
bread may be eaten with impunity by persons whose delicate di- 
gestive organs are impaired by the use of ordinary yeast bread. It 
is certain that for rolls, biscuits, griddle-cakes, and the whole list 
of "Break&st and Tea Cakes," the ** Bread Preparation" is supe. 
nor to yeast or soda, or any of the baking-powders in common use. 

Soda biscuit must be handled as little and made as rapidly as 
possible ; mix soda and cream tartar or baking-powder in the flour 



BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. »8 

(with sweet milk use baking-powder or soda and cream tartar, with 
iour milk soda alone), so that the effervescence takes place in the 
mixture. One tea-spoon soda and two of cream tartar, or three 
tea-spoons baking-powder, to every two pints of flour, is about the 
right proportion. Bake in a quick oven as soon as made, and they 
rise more quickly if put into hot pans. Gems of all kinds require 
a hot oven, bi)t the fire should be built some time before they ar» 
put into the oven, and allowed to go down by the time they are 
light, as the heat necessary to raise them will bum them in baking 
if kept up. 

All biscuit and bread, except brown and Graham bread, should 
be pricked with a fork before putting them> in the oven. 

Soda and raised biscuit and bread or cake, when stale, can be 
made almost as nice as fresh by plunging for an instant into cold 
water, and then placing in a pan in the oven ten or fifteen minutes; 
thus treated they should be used immediately. 

Waffle-irons should be heated, then buttered or greased with 
lard, and one side filled with batter, closed and laid on the fire or 
placed on the stove, and after a few minutes turned' on the other 
side. They take about twice as long to bake as griddle-o^es, and 
are delicious with a dressing of ground cinnamon. Midfins are 
baked in muffin-rings. In eating them, do not cut but break them 
open. 

The success of these recipes, and all others in this book in which 
soda and cream tartar are used, will depend on the purity of these 
ingredients. Always buy the jmre English bicarbonate of soda, and 
the pare cream tartar. They are higher-priced, but cheaper in the 
end, and are free from injurious substances. When not found at 
the grooer^s, they may generally be had at the druggist's.

Buttered Toast. 

Although toast is commonly used, few know how to prepare it 
nicely. Take bread not too fresh, cut thin and evenly, trim off the 
crust-edges for the crumb-jar; first warm each side of the bread, 
then present the first side again to the fire until it takes on a rich, 
even, brown color ; treat the other side in the same way ; butter 
send serve immediately. The coals should be bright and hot. Toast 
properly made id very digestible, because all the moisture is ex- 
tracted, and the bread has become pure farina of wheat; but when 
it is exposed to a hot fire and the outside charred, the inside remains 
as moist as ever, and butter applied to it while warm does not pene- 
trate, but floats on the surface in the form of rancid oil. Or, beat 
one cup of butter and three table-spoons flour to a cream, pour over 
this one and a half pints bailing water ; place over a kettle of boil' 
ing water for ten minutes, dip into it the toast, and serve hot. 

Or, dip each slice of toast in boiling hot water (slightly salted)^ 
spread with butter, cover and keep hot 



BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. 85 

Excellent Toast. 
Cat slioes of a uniform thicknees, of half an inch ; move aromid 
over a brisk fire, to have all parts toasted alike; keep only so near 
fhe coals that the pieces will be heated through when both sides are 
well browned. If the slightest point is blackened or charred, scrape 
it off, or it will spoil the flavor of the whole. If covered with an 
earthen bowl, i( will keep both warm and moist. A clean towel or 
napkin will answer if it is to go at once to the table. Stale bread 
may be used for milk-toast ; sour bread may be improved by toast- 
ing it through, but sweet, light bread, only a day old or less, makes 

ihe best toast. 

Breakfast Toast. 

Add to one-half pint of sweet milk two tal)le-dpoons sugar, a

it will be a little warm until morning ; cut ofl* pieces, and carefully 
shape them into rolls of the desired size by rolling them between the 
hands, but do not knead them ; dip the sides of each into drawn 
butter when they are shaped, and place them in the baking-pan 
(the butter prevents their sticking together when baked, and they 
will be smooth and perfect when separated). Rub them over the 
top with drawn butter, and dust a litUe fine salt over the top ; set 
b a warm place, and they will quickly rise ready for baking. These 
are delicious. ^

Every-Day Rolus. 

Take a piece of bread dough ou baking day, when molded out 
the last time, about enough for a small loaf, spread out a little, add 
0!ie eggy two table-spoons of sugar, and three-fourths cup of lard ; 
add a little flour and a smaM tea-spoon soda if the least bit sour ; 
mix well, let rise, mold into rolls or biscuits, set to rise again, and 
they will be ready for the oven in twenty or thirty minutes.

into a bread pan, add a tea-spoon salt, half cup lard, and flour 
enough for a sofk dough ; mix up, and set in a warm, even tempera- 
ture; when risen, knead down and place again to rise, repeating 
this process five or six times ; cut in small pieces and mold on the 
bread-board in rolls about one inch thick by five long; roll in 
melted butter or sweet lard, and place in well-greased baking paiis 
(nine inches long by five wide and two and a half in depfli, makes a 
convenien1>sized pan, which holds fifteen of these rolb; or, if twice 
the width, put in two rows); press the rolls closely together, so that 
they will only be about half an inch in width. Let rise a short 
tune and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven ; if the top browns too 
rapidly, cover with paper. These rolls, if properly made, are very 
white, light and tender. 

Or, make rolls larger, and just before putting them in the oven, 
cut deeply across each one with a sharp knife. This will make the 
cleft roll, so famous among French cooks.

Wedding Sandwich Rolls. 

Late in the evening make a rather stifl* potato sponge (see direc- 
tions under ^* Bread-Making"), and in the morning mix in as much 
flour as will make a soft dough, knead well, and place to rise; 
when sufficiently light, knead down again, repeating the operation 
two or three times, remembering not to let the dough become sour 
by rising too light ; mold into common-sized loaves, place in your 
dripping-pan to rise, and bake very carefully, so as to secure the 
veiy slightest brown crust possible. On taking out of the oven, roll 
 in a cloth tightly wrung out of water, with a large bread-blanket 
folded and wrapped around all. Let cool three or four hours, cut 
lengthwise of the loaf (not using the outside piece), first spreading 
lightly with good sweet butter, then cutting in slices not more than 
a quarter of an inch, or jast as thin as possible, using for this pur- 
pose a very thin, sharp knife ; lay on cold boiled ham cut in very 
thin shavings (no matter if in small pieces), roll up very slowly and 
carefully, and place where it will not unroll. Treat each sandwich 
in the same manner, always spreading the bread with butter before 
cutting. If by chance the bread is baked with too hard a crust, cut 
off^a thin shaving of the brownest part very smoothly before making 
into sandwiches. These sandwiches are truly delicious if properly 
made, but they require great care, experience, and good judgment 
Served on an oblong platter, piled in pyramid style, row upon row, 
they will resemble nicely rolled dinner napkins. They must be 
made and served the same day. — Mrs, James W. Robinson.

beatiog it up well ; then add one quart of cold water, stir and add 

one-balf cup of potato yeast, or one cup of brewer's ; beat in well 

and set in a warm place to rise over night. In the morning add 

salt and flour enough to make a moderately stiff dough ; set in a 

warm place to rise, and, when risen, knead down and set to rise 

again. This time knead down and place in a large stone crock or 

bowl, covered tightly with a tin pan to prevent the surface from 

drying, and set away in a cool place. When needed, turn out on a 

bread-board, cut off a piece as large as you wish to use, roll out to 

the thickness of ordinary soda biscuit, cut, and put in the oven to bake 

immediately. Set away the rest of the dough as before, and it will 

keep a week in winter, and is very convenient for hot break&st-rolls. — 

Mrs, D. Buxton, 

Vienna Rolls. 

Have ready in a bowl a table-spoon of butter or lard, made soft 

by warming a little, and stirring with a spoon. Add to one quart 

of unsifted flour two heaping tea-spoons baking powder ; mix and 

sift thoroughly together, and place in a bowl with butter. Take 

more or less sweet milk as may be necessary to form a dough of 

usual sdflhess, according to the flour (about three-fourths of a pint), 

put into the milk half a tea-spoon of salt, and then stir it into the 

flour, etc., with a spoon, forming the dough, which turn out on a 

board and knead sufficiently to make smooth. Boll out half an inch 

tnfck, and cut witn a large rouna cutter ; loia eacn one over to lorm 

a half round, wetting a little between the folds to make them stick 

together ; place on buttered pans, so as not to touch, wash over on 

top with milk to give them a gloss, and bake immediately in a hot 

oven about twenty minutes. It will do them no harm to stand half 

an hour before baking, if it is desired. 

Cracknelus. 
To one pint of rich milk put two ounces butter and spoon of

Wheaten Gemb. 

Mix one tea-spoon baking-powder and a little salt into one pint 
flour ; add to the beaten yolks of two eggs one tea-cup sweet milk 
or cream, a piece of butter (melted) half the size of an egg, the 
flour with baking-powder and salt mixed, and the well-beaten whites 
of the two eggs. Beat well, bake immediately in gem-pans in a hot

Wheat Muffiks. 

Mix one pint milk, two eggs, three table-spoons yeast, and salt- 
spoon of salt, with flour enough to make a stiff batter ; let rise four 
or five hours and bake in muffin-nngs in a hot oven, for about ten 
minutes. This recipe may be made with Graham flour, by adding 
two table-spoons of molasses, and is excellent. — Mn, O, W, MarehanL 

Waffles. 

Take one quart of flour, a tea-spoon of salt, a table-spoon of 
melted butter, and milk enough to make a thick batter. Mix thor- 
oughly. Add two well-beaten eggs, and one measure each of acid 
and soda (or two heaping tea-spoons acid and one moderately heap- 
ing tea-spoon soda) of Horsford's Bread Preparation ; stir well, and 
bake at once in waffle-irons. 

r Quick Waffles. 

Two pints sweet milk, one cup butter (melted), sifted flour to 
make a soft batter ; add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs, then the 
beaten whites, and lastly (just before baking) four tea-spoons baking- 
powder, beating very hard and &st for a few minutes. These are 
very good with four or five eggs, but much better with more. — Mn,

COBV MXTBH. 

Put four quarts fresh water in a kettle to boil, salt to suit the 
taste ; when it begins to boil stir in one and one-half quarts meal, 
letting it sift through the' lingers slowly to prevent lumps, adding 
it a little &ster at the last, until as thick as can be oonvenientlj 
stirred with one hand ; set in the oven in the kettle (or take out into 
a pan), bake an hour, and it will be thoroughly cooked. It takes 
corn-meal so long to cook thoroughly that it is very difficult to boil 
it until done without burning. Excellent for frying when cold. 
Use a hard wood paddle, two feet long, with a blade two inches 
wide and seven inches long, to stir with. The thorough cooking and 
baking in oven afterwards, takes away all the raw taste that mush 
18 apt to have, and adds much to its sweetness and delicious flavor. — 
Mm a. W. 8., NoAviUcy Tenn. 

Alabama ^'Boe Cake." 

One pint corn-meal, one-half tablenspoonful salt, and cold water 
to make a stiff batter; beat well; sprinkle a hot griddle with meal, 
let brown; then spread *'hoe cake" half an inch thick, let brown 
on both sides. Oood for dyspeptics. — Mrs. Sperry, NashviUe^ Tenn. 

Alabama Johnny Cake. 

Cook a pint of rice till tender, add a table-spoon butter; when 
oold add two beaten eggs and one pint meal, and when mixed spread 
on an oaken board and bake by tipping the board up before the fire- 
place. Whenr done on one side turn over. The dough should be 
q>read half an inch thick. — Mrs. Young, Ala. 

Aunt Jennie's Johnny Cake. 
One cup each sweet milk and buttermilk, one tea-spoon each salt 
and soda, one table-spoon melted butter. Mix with enough meal 
to roll into a sheet half an inch thick. Spread on a clean, sweet 
board, set before fire at an angle that will prevent cake slipping off, 
until it hardens, then stand upright. Baste often with butter until 

nicely crisped.

Mrs. Buxton's Gbaham Gems. 
Take one egg and beat well, add pinch of salt, one quart butter- 
milk or sour milk, and Graham flour enough to make a stifi* batter : 
add one heaping tea-spoon soda and stir thoroughly with a spoon ; 
heat and grease gem-irons, and after dipping the spoon in cold 
water, drop a spoonful of batter in each pan, repeating until all

Graham Mush. 
Sift meal slowly into boiling salted water, stirring briskly until 
it is as thick as can be stirred with one hand ; serve with milk or 
cream and sugar, or butter and syrup. It is much improved by 
removing from the kettle to a pan as soon as thoroughly mixed, 
and steaming for three or four hours. It may also be eaten cold. 
or sliced and firied like com mush. 

Oat-Meal Mush. 
To two quarts boiling water, well salted, add one and a half cups 
best oat meal (Irish, Scotch, Canadian or Akron are best) ; stir in

•love. (Cook in a custard-kettle with water in outer kettle). To 
oook for break&st it may be put on over night, allowing it tu boil 
an hour or two in the evening, but it is better when ireshly cooked. 
Serve with cream and sugar. This is unsurpassed as a break&st- 
dishy especially for growing children, who need bone and muscle- 
producing food. To be wholesome it must be weU cooked^ and not 
the pasty, half-cooked mass usually served at boarding-houses. 
There are a fow persons with very delicate digestive powers, who 
should eat oat-meal o\\\y when thoroughly pearled, as the outer 
husks of the grain irritate the coatings of the stomach. In lieu 
of a custard-kettle the mush may be made in a pan or small tin 
bucket, and then placed in a steamer and steamed two hours. 

Steamed Oat-Meal. 

To one tea-cup oat-meal add one quart cold water, teaspoon salt, 
put in steamer over a kettle of cold water, and steam one hour and 
a half after meal begins to cook. 

Cracked Wheat. 

Two quarts salted water to two cups best white winter wheat;

steam four hours : Or, make a strong sack of thick muslin or drilling, 
moisten wneat with cold water, add a little salt, place in sack, leav- 
ing half the space for wheat to swell in. Fit a -round sheet of tin, 
perforated with holes half an inch in diameter, to the inside of 
ordinary kettle, so that it will rest two or three inches from th^ 
bottom; lay sack on the tin, put in water enough to reach tin, and 
boil from three to four hours, supplying water as it evaporates. 
Serve with butter and syrup, or cream and sugar. When cold, slice 
and fry ; or warm with a little milk and salt in a pan greased with 
a little butter; or make in griddle-cakes with a batter of eggs, milk, 
and a little flour, and pinch of salt.

FRITTERS. 49 



FEITTERS. 



Make frittera quickly and beat thoroughly. A good rale for 
them 18 two eggs, one half-pint milk, one tea-spoon salt, and two 
eups flour; have the lard in which to cook them nice and sweet and 
hot. Clarified &t boils at about five hundred degrees — more than 
double the heat of boiling water — and fat actually boiling will burn 
to a cinder any thing that is dropped into it. The proper cooking 
heat is three hundred and seventy-five degrees, and is indicated by 
a Uue smoke arising from the surface of the fat. When this point 
is reached, the fat may be held at that degree of heat, and pre- 
vented from burning by dropping into it a peeled potato or a piece 
of hard bread, which furnishes something for the &,t to act on. 
The heat may also be tested by dropping in a teanspoon of the bat- 
ter ; if the temperature is right it will quickly rise in a light ball 
with a splutter, and soon brown ; take up carefully the moment they 
are done, with a wire spoon ; drain in a hot colander, and sift pow- 
dered sugar over them; serve hot. Pork fritters are made by 
dipping thin bits of breakfast-bacon or fat pork in the batter: fruit 
firitters by chopping any kind of fresh or canned fruit fine and mix- 
ing it with batter, or by dipping quarters or halves in batter. The 
fruit may be improved in flavor by sprinkling sugar and grated 
-lemon peel over it, and allowing it to remain two or three hours, 
after which drain and dip as above. Batters for fritters should be 
made an hour before using, as the grains of flour swell by standing 
after being moistened, and thus become lighter. Add the whites 
of eggs just before frying. It is better not to use sugar in batter, 
as it tends to make it heavy. Sprinkle over them in the dish when 

just ready to serve. 

At.at^ama Rice Fbittebs. 

Four eggs beaten very light, one pint milk, one cup boiled rice, 
three tea-spoons baking-powder in one quart flour; make into a

of sugar, one and a half cups water, stick of cinnamon ; boil until 
clear. — **Riiik Royal" AUaiita, Ga. 



50 FRITTERS. 

Apfle Fritters. 

Make a batter in proportion of one cup sweet milk to two cupe 
flour, a heaping tea-spoon baking powder, two eggs beaten sep- 
arately, one tablespoon sugar, and salt-spoon salt ; heat the milk 
a little more than milk- warm, add slowly to the beaten yolks and 
sugar, then add flour and whites of eggs; stir all together, and 
throw in thin slices of good sour apples, dipping the batter up 
over them; drop in boiling lard in large spoonfuls with piece of 
apple in each, and fry to a light brown. Serve with maple syrup 
or a nice syrup made of sugar. — Mrs. James Henderson, 

Clam Fritters. 
Take raw clams, chopped fine, and make a batter with juice, an 
equal quantity of sweet milk, four eggs to each pint of liquid, and 
flour sufficient to stiflen ; fry like other fritters. — Mrs. H. B. S, 

Corn Oysters. 
To one quart grated com add three eggs and three or four grated 
crackers, beat well and season with pepper and salt; have ready in 
skillet butter and lard or beef-drippings in equal proportions, liot 
but not scorching; drop in little cakes about the size of an oyster 
(for this purpose using a tea-spoon); when brown turn and fry 
on the other side, watx;hing constantly for fear of burning. If the 
flit is just the right heat, the oysters will be light and delicious, 
but if not, heavy and ** soggy." Serve hot and keep dish well cov- 
ered. It is better to beat whites of eggs to a stifl" froth and add 
just before frying. — Mrs. V. G. Husky Afirmeapolis, Minn. 

Cream Fritters. 
One and a half pmts flour, one pint milk, six well-beaten eggs, 
one-half nutmeg,' two tea-spoons salt, one pint cream ; stir the 
whole enough to mix the cream ; fry in small cakes. — Mrs. M. K. P. 

Lemon Fritters. 
One-fourth pound of eggs, one-half pound flour, one-fourth 
pound sugar (pulverized) ; beat the yolks well, add the flour and 
enough fresh mOk to make a stifl* batter (about a gill of milk) ; 
beat the whites stiff* with the sugar, the juice of a lemon and some 
of the yellow peel grated off, or a spoon of extract of lemon. 



OBIDDLE-CAKES, 51 

When ready to cook beat the whites well into the batter and pro- 
ceed to cook. Have plenty of good lard, heated slowly ; just as it 
ieffins to rnnoke, after bubbling, drop in by spoonfuls enough fritters 
to fill the vessel without crowding. The cold batter will lower the 
temperature of the &X sufficiently to keep it at proper cooking 
heat. The fritters will begin to brown very quickly, and should be 
tamed with a wire spoon. If they begin to color dark brown 
check the heat immediately. If these directions are followed ai - 
cnrately, they may be lifted from the fat and laid upon a napkin or 
folded paper comparatively free from grease. Dust the fritters 
well with sugar and nutmeg, if agreeable. For supper eat them so, 
but for dinner some nice sauce should be served. Some persons 
substitute honey or maple syrup for sauce. Fritters bear a bad 
reputation, but when properly made, and eaten occasionally for a 
change, are quite as wholesome as many of the messes recommended 

as food for dyspeptics. 

Vanities. 

Beat two eggs, stir in a pinch of salt and a half tea-spoon 
rose-water, add sifted flour till just thick enough to roll out, cut 
with a cake-cutter, and fry quickly in hot lard. Sift powdered 
sugar on them while hot, and when cool put a tea-spoon of jelly in 
the center of each one. Nice for tea or dessert. — Mrs, D. C. Hat- 
TUkgUnif 



GRIDDLE-CAKES. 



Griddle-cakes should be well beaten when first made, and are 
much lighter when the eggs are separated, whipfMng the yolks to 
a thick cream, and adding the whites beaten to a stifiT froth just 
before baking. Some never stir buckwheat cakes after they have 
risen, but take them out carefully with a large spoon, placing 
the spoon when emptied in a saucer, and not back again into the 
batter. In baking griddle-cakes have the griddle clean, and, if the 
cakes stick, sprinkle on salt and rub with a coarse cloth before 
greasing. Some prefer griddles made of soap-stone, which need no 



62 QBIDDLE-CAKBS. 

greasing, lliej need to be very hot, but greasing spoils theot. 
Thej are more ooetly and more easily broken than iron. Iron 
griddles, if properly cared for, need washing but seldom. Imme- 
diately after use they should be carefully wiped and put away out 
of the dust, never to be used for any other purpose. Never turn 
griddle-cakes the second time while baking, as it makes then 
heavy, and serve the same side up as when taken from griddles. 



Buckwheat Cakes. 

Buckwheat flour, when properly ground, is perfectly free from 
grits. The grain should be run through the smutter with a strong 
blast before grinding, and the greatest care taken through the 
whole process. Adulteration with rye or corn cheapens the flour, 
but injures the quality. The pure buckwheat is best, and is un- 
surpassed for griddle-cakes. To make batter, warm one pint sweet 
milk and one pint water (one may be cold and the other boiling) ; 
put lialf this mixture in a stone crock, add five tea-cups buckwheat 
flour, beat well until smooth, add the rest of the milk and water, 
and last a tearcup of yeast. Or, the same ingredients and propor- 
tions may be used except adding two table-spoons of molasses or 
sugar, and using one quart of water instead of one pint each of 
milk and water. — Miss S. A, Melehing.

baking on the griddle. Sweet milk may be used (with the other 
ingredients in same quantity) with Horsford's Bread Preparation, 
one measure each of soda and acid, which must be thoroughly 
mixed with the flour. These may also be made without ^gs.

TEAST. 



The best is potato yeast, because bread made witk it is moister^ 
and there is no danger of injuring the flavor of the bread by ap 
excess of yeast. Dry yeast should be made in May or June for 
summer use, and in October for winter use. In hot and damp 
weather, dry yeast sometimes loses its vitality ; however, many use 
it on account of its convenience, since there is no danger of it9 
aouring in summer or freezing in winter. Soft hop or potato yeast 



YEAST. 56 

will keep in a cool place one or two weeks in warm weather, and in 
cold weather five or six weeks, care being taken that it does not 
freeise. Never add soda to yeast; if it becomes sour it will do to 
start fresh yeast, but will never make good bread. Make yeast in 
a bright tin pan, kept for this purpose alone. When it is risen 
sufficiently, a thick white scum rises to the top. Keep in a stone 
jar with a close-fitting cover, or in a jug, on the cellar bottom, or 
in ice-chest, or in some other cool place. Always shake the jug 
before taking out yeast for use. Leave cork loose for first twelve 
hours. Extreme heat or freezing kills the plant; which grows while 
fermentation goes on. The jar or jug, when emptied, should be 
washed first in cold water, then in soap and water, and aflerward 
in hot water, which may be allowed to stand a half hour, when 
pour out Let jar cool, and it is ready for use. The cork or cover 
needs the same careful attention. Many times the yeast is spoiled 
by want of care and neatness in washing the yeast jar. Keep hops 
in a paper sack in a dry, cool place. One pint of potato yeast, 
one tea-cup of hop yeast, a piece of compressed yeast size of a 
walnut, and one yeast cake, or two-thirds of a tea-cup of yeast 
crumbs, are equal in strength.

Dry Yeast. 

Boil two large potafees and a handful of hops (the latter in a 
bag) in three pints water ; when done, take out potatoes, mash well, 
add one pint flour, and pour boiling hot water over all; beat well 
together, adding one table-spoon salt, one of ginger, and one-half 
cup sugar ; when luke-warm add one cup good yeast and let stand 
two days (or only one day, if very warm weather), stirring down 
frequently ; add good white corn meal until thick enough to make 
into cakes about half an inch in thickness; place to dry in the 
shade (never expose to the sun or to stove heat) where the air will 
pass freely, so as to dry them as soon as possible, as the fermentation 
goes on as long as there is any moisture ; turn the cakes frequently, 
breaking them up somewhat, or even crumbling, so they will dry 
out evenly and quickly ; when thoroughly dried put in a paper sack, 
and keep in a dry place. A small cake will make a sponge suffi- 
cient to bake five or six ordinary loaves. — Mrs^ E. T. Canon.

A jeast which is especially good for the use of fiurmers, and 
others who use a great deal of bread and bake frequently, is made 
as follows: Take a handful of unpressed or two ounces of pressed 
hops (those showing the pollen dust are best), put them in one quart 
of water, with four ordinary potatoes, and boil till the potatoes are 
well cooked ; mash all together, and strain through a linen strainer, 
add flour enough to make a thick batter ; a tea-spoon salt, a table- 
spoon pulverized ginger and half a cup sugar ; set it back on the 
fire and let it come to a boil, stirring constantly, and set by to cool ; 
when only milk warm add a cup of old yeast, or two cakes grocers' 
dry hop yeast, or half a cup bakers'. This will be light in two or 
three hours. The yeast may be made perpetual, by saving a cup 
when started, but it must be kept from freezing in winter and in a 
cool place in summer. This is a good mode, and acceptable to all 
who prefer yeast bread. — ifr«. H. Young, 

Hop Yeast. 

Place a handful of hops in two quarts of cold water, boil slowly 
for a half- hour, strain boiling hot on one pint flour and one table- 
spoon salt (gradually at first in order to mix smoothly) ; when luke- 
warm add a half pint of yeast, and set in a warm place to rise. 
When light, cover and keep in a cool plac^ — Mn. M. J. TFoocfa. 

Potato Yeast without Hops. 

Four good-sized potatoes peeled, boiled and mashed, four table- 
spoons white sugar, one of ginger, one of salt, two cups flour; pour 
over this a pint of boiling water, and beat till all the lumps disap- 
pear. After it has cooled, add to it one cup good yeast, and set 
away to rise ; when risen put in glass or stone jar, cover and set 
away in a cool place. — Mrs, Oeorge H. Rugt, 

Potato Yeast. 
Boil one cup hops in a sack in two quarts water for fifteen minutes; 
remove sack with hops, add immediately after grating (to prevent 
their darkening) five good-sized Irish potatoes, peeled and grated 
raw, one cup white sugar, one table-spoon salt, and one of ginger ; 
stir occasionally and cook from five to ten minutes, and it will boil

op thick like starch ; turn into a jar, and when just tepid in sum- 
mer, or quite warm in winter, add one-half pint good yeast (always 
save some to start with) ; set jar in a large tin pan, and as often as 
it rises stir down until fermentation ceases, when it will be quite 
thin. Cover closely, and set away in a cool place, and it will keep 
two weeks. When yeast smells sour but does not taste sour it is 
still good ; if it has no smell it is dead. One cup will make six 
good-sized loaves. — Mrs. D. BuxUm. 

Potato Yeabt. 

Take as many hops as can be grasped in the hand twice, put one- 
half gallon water over them in a new coffee-pot kept for that pur- 
pose, boil slowly for one hour. Do not tie them in a cloth to boil, 
as that keeps the pollen (an important rising property) out of the 
yeast Pare and grate half a dozen large potatoes into a two gallon 
stone crock, add a half cup sugar, table-spoon each of salt and 
ginger, pour over this a half gallon of the boiling hop- water, stir- 
ring all the time. When milk-warm, add one cup of good lively 
yeast, set in a warm place until it rises, and remove to the cellar or 
some other cool place. The boiling hop-water must be added to po- 
tatoes imTnediately or they will darken, and darken the yeast. A 
good way to prevent the potatoes from darkening is to grate them 
into a pan half filled witn cold water. As grated the potatoes sink 
to the bottom ; when done grating, pour off the water ai^d add 'the 
boiling hop-water. This is an excellent recipe, and the method 
given for boiling hops is especially recommended. 

• Yeast. 

Pare and boil four ordinary-sized potatoes, boiling at the same 
time in a separate vessel a good handful of hops. When the pota- 
toes are done, mash fine and add, after straining, the water in which 
the hops were boiled ; put into this one cup white sugar and one- 
half cup salt, and add sufficient water to make one gallon ; when 
cold add one cup of good yeast, let stand in a warm place for a few 
hours until it will '' sing" on being stirred, when it is ready for use. 
Keep covered in a cellar or cool place. — Mrs. C. M.

Yeast without Yeabt. 

This requires no yeast to raise it, and has been called the ''best 
yeast in the world/' Monday morning, boil one pint hops in two 
gallons water for half an hour, strain into a crock and let the liquid 
become lukewarm, add two even tea-spoons salt and half a pint 
best brown sugar ; mix half a pint flour smooth with some of the 
liquor, and stir all well together. On Wednesday, add three pounds 
potiitoes boiled and mashed, stir well and let stand till Thursday, 
then straiu and put in stone-jugs, but for the first day or two leave 
the corks quite loose. Stir the yeast occasionally while making, 
and keep near the fire. It should be made two weeks before using, 
aud will keep any length of time, improving with age. Keep it in 
a cool place, and shake the jug before pouring from it, but with 
the cork out, holding the palm of the hand over the mouth to pre- 
vent the escape of the yeast. 

Yahoo Yeast. 

Take a table-spoonful and a half of New Orleans molasses, and 
add to it the same quantity of warm water. Stir in enough flour 
to make a thin batter; set it in a warm place — ^not hot — ^and it will 
soon begin to throw up bubbles on the top, and in a short time fer- 
ment. Meanwhile, have all ready to make the yeast as soon as the 
batter begins to work. Put a tea-cup of hops into a clean porce- 
lain kettle, and add two quarts of boiling water. Set over the fire, 
and boil steadily twenty minutes. Strain it, after boiling, into a 
clean dish. Stir in a pint of flour and a table-spoonful of salt. Be 
sure and stir it free from lumps. Set again over the fire, stirring 
constantly, until it boils up and thickens. If to« thick after it 
boils up, pour in boiling water till it is about the consistency of 
good starch. Then pour back into the bowl, cover over till milk- 
warm, then stir in the '' risings" made of molasses, flour and water. 
Set where it will be kept warm until it has risen and is quite light* 
Then put into a jug, cork, and set in a cool place for use. — Mrs.

CAKE-MAKING. 



" Let all things be done decently and in order/' and the first to 
pat in order when you ace going to bake is yourself. Secure the 
hair in a net or other covering, to prevent any from falling, and 
brush the shoulders and back to be sure none are lodged there that 
might blow off; make the hands and finger nails clean, roll the 
sleeves up above the elbows, and put on a large, clean apron. Clean 
the kitchen table of utensils and every thing not needed, and pro- 
vide every thing that will be needed until the cake is baked, not 
forgetting even the broom-splints previously picked ofi* the new 
broom and laid away carefully in a little box. (A kifitting-needle 
may be kept for testing cake instead of splints.) If it is warm- 
weather, place the eggs in cold water, and let stand a few minutes, 
as they will then make finer froth ; and be sure they are fresh, as 
they will not make a stiff* froth from any amount of beating if old. 
The cake-tin» should be prepared -before the qake^ when baking 
powder is used, as it effervesces but once, and there should be no 
delay in baking, as the mixture should be made firm by the heat, 
while the efervescing process is going on. Grease the pans with 
ftesh lard, which is much better than butter ; line the bottom with 
paper, using six or eight thicknesses if the cake is large, and greas- 
ing the top one well. (In some ovens, however, fewer thicknesses 
of paper would be needed on the bottom, and in some the sides 
ak> should be lined with one or two thicknesses.) Sift flour and sugar 
(if not pulverized), and measure or weigh. Firkin or very salt but* 

IS©) 



60 OAKE-MAKINQ. 

tat should be cut in bits and washed to freshen a little; if verj 
hard, warm carefully, but in no case allow any of it to melt. Good 
butter must be used, as the heat develops any latent bad qualities. 
Use pulverized sugar for all delicate cakes; for rich cakes coffee- 
crushed, powdered and sifted; for dark cakes, the best brown 
sugars are best; for jelly-cakes, light fruitK^akes, etc., granulated 
and coffee ''A" are best and most economical. Beat the yolks of 
eggs thoroughly, and strain ; set the whites away in a cool place 
'Until the cake is ready for them, then beat them vigorously iu a cool 
room, till they will remain ki the dish when turned upside down. 
Sift a part of the measured flour with the baking-powder or soda 
and cream tartar through a hand-sieve (which should be among the 
utensils of every housekeeper), and mix thoroughly with the rest of 
the flour. In using new flour for either bread or cake-making, it 
can be * 'ripened" for use by placing the quantity intended for bak- 
ing in the hot sun for a few hours, or before the kitchen fire. In 
using milk, note this: that sour milk makes a spongy, light cake ; 
sweet milk, one that cuts like pound cake ; remembering that with 
sour milk soda alone is used, while with sweet milk baking powder 
or soda and cream tartar are to be added. 

Having thus gathered the material, cut butter (in cold weather) 
into small pieces, and warm, not melt; beat the butter and sugar to 
a cream, add the milk in smal] quantities (never use fresh and stale 
milk in same cake), next the yolks of eggs, then a part of the flour, 
then a part of the whites, and so on until the whole is used ; lastly, 
add the flavoring. Many good cake-makers first stir the milk and 
flavoring into the creiimed butter and sugar, then the yolks, next 
the whites, and lastly the flour, first taking about two-thirds of it 
and thoroughly niixia*^ the baking powder through it; the re> 
raainder of the flour is then left to be used at discretion. A little 
more or less flour may be needed, according to the climate, or to 
the kind of flour used, as the " New Process" flour requires one* 
eighth less than other brands. There is great " knack" in beating 
cake; don't stir, but beat thoroughly, bringing the batter up from the 
bottom of the dish at every stroke ; in this way the air is driven into 
the cells of the batter, instead of out of them — but the cells will be 
finer if beaten more slowly at the last, remembering that the motion 



CAKE-MAKJNO. 61 

liioiild alivays be upwarcL In winter it is easier to beat with the 
hand, but in summer a wooden spoon is better. An iron spoon 
turns the mixture dark. Never beat a cake in tin, but use earthen 
or stoneware. Unskillful mixing, too rapid or unequal baking, or a 
sudden decrease in heat before it is quite done, will cause streaks in 
the cake. Always bake a small cake first, fill a patty pan, or cover 
to a baking-powder can, one-third full, and bake ; then add more 
or leas flour as required.' If the cake is hard and solid, it needs a 
few tea-spoons of milk; if more flour is Deeded it will &11 in the 
middle and be spongy and crumbly.. Powdered sugar may be 
sifted on the top of any cake while it is a little warm; if it dis- 
solves add more, when it is cold, keep some for that purpose in a 
since box with a perforated top. The white portion of orange or 
lemon-peel should never be used ; grate only the yellow. When 
recipes call for soda and cream of tartar, baking powder may be 
used by taking the same quantity as required of both, or Horsford's 
Bread Preparation will be found excellent *'Milk" always means 
noeet milk. ''A cup" always means a tea cup, not a cofiee cup. 
Sour milk may always be used instead of sweet, by using soda only. 
The proportions of rising-powder to one quart of flour are three tea- 
spoons baking-powder, or one teanspoon soda and two tea-spoons 
cream tartar, or one measure each of Horsford's Bread Preparation, 
or one pint sour milk and one level tea-spoon soda. 

Fruit Cake. 
Most ladies think fruit cake quite incomplete without wine or 
brandy, but it can be made equally good on strictly temperance 
principles, by substituting one-third of a cup of molasses for a wine- 
glass of brandy. The objection to the use of liquor in sauces does 
not, however, hold good against that used in cake-making, as the 
alcohol is converted to vapor by the heat and passes off with the 
other gases. There are many, however, who object to the use of 
. liquors in any way, and to keeping them in the house, and such 
will find the above an excellent and cheap substitute. 

Baisins should never be washed, as it is difi^cult to dry out the 
moisture absorbed by them, and every particle of moisture retained 
tends to make the cake heavy. To remove the stems and ex« 
traneous matter, place the raisins in a coarse towel and rub them in 



62 CAKE-MAKING. 

this untQ as dean as rubbing will make them ; then pick over care- 
fully, remove any stems or other defects which may be left. The 
raisins should be prepared before the cake, and added the last thing 
before putting in the oven, as, being heavy, they sink to the bottom 
if allowed to stand. To seed, clip with the scissors, or cut with a 
sharp knife. Do not chop too fine ; if for light fruit cake, seeding 
is all that is necessary. Slice the citron thin, and do not have the 
pieces too large, or they will cause the cake to break apart in cut- 
ting. Currants should be kept prepared for use as follows : Wash 
in warm water, rubbing well, pour off water, and repeat until the 
water is clear; drain them in a sieve, spread on a cloth and rub 
dry; pick out bad ones, dry carefully in a cool oven or in the 
''heater" (or in the sun and wind, with a thin gauze over them to 
keep off flies, insects and dust), and set away for use. When the 
fruit is all mixed, cream the butter and sugar — this is very im- 
portant in all cakes — ^add the spices, molasses, or liquors, then the 
milk (if any used), next the eggs well beaten, adding whites with 
the flour, as previously directed. Always beat whites and yolks 
separately if many eggs are used, but if only a few, it is just as well 
to beat both together. Next add the flour (which in making black 
fruit cake may be browned), prepared with baking powder or soda 
and cream tartar, then the flavoring (lemon and vanilla, in equal 
parts, make the best flavoring), and lastly the fruit dredged with a 
very little flour. Some prefer to mix the fruit with all the flour. 
When but little fruit is used it may be dropped into the dough after 
it is in the pan, and pushed just beneath the surface, which pre- 
vents it from settling to the bottom. The batter for fruit cake 
should be quite stiff. 

In making very large cakes that require three or four hours to 
Imke, an excellent way for lining the pan is the following: Fit three 
pa|)ers carefully, grease thoroughly, make a paste of equal parts 
Graham and fine flour, wet with water just stiff enough to spread 
easily with a spoon, place the first paper in the pan with the greased 
side down, and spread the paste evenly over the paper about as 
thick as pie-crust. In covering the sides of the pan, use a little 
paste to stick a portion of the paper to the top of the jmn to keep it 
from slipping out of place, press the second paper carefully into ^ts 



CAKE-MAKIXO. 63 

place, with the greased side up, and next put in the third paper as 
jou would into any baking-pan, and pour in the cake. Earthen 
pans are used by some, as they do not heat so quickly and are less 
liable to bum the cake. 

When using a milk -pan or pans, without stems, a glass bottle filled 
with shot to give it weight, and greased, may be placed in the center 
of the pan, or a stem may be made of paste-board, rolled up, but 
the latter is more troublesome to keep in place. The cake is apt to 
bum around the edges before it is done unless there is a tube in the 
center. 

All exoept layer cakes should be covered with a paper cap, (or a 
sheet of brown paper, which the careful housewife will save from 
ber grocers' packages), when first put into the oven. Take a square 
of brown paper large enough to cover well the cake pan, cut off the 
comers, and lay a plait on four sides, fastening each with a pin so 
as to fit nicely over the pan. This will throw it up in the center, 
80 that the cover will not touch the cake. Save the cap, as it can be 
used several times. 

Before commencing, clean out the stove, take off the lids and brush 
inside, rake it out underneath^ get all the ashes out of the comers, 
have the best of fuel at hand. Don't build a baking fire before it 
is needed, have it only moderate, and add the extra fuel in time to 
get it nicely burning. 

THE OVEN. 

Too much care can not be given to the preparation of the oven, 
which is oftener too hot than too cool ; however, an oven too cold 
At first will ruin any cake. Cake should rise and begin to bake 
before browning much, large cakes requiring a good, steady, solid 
heat, about such as for baking bread ; layer cakes, a brisk hot fire, 
M they must be baked quickly. A good plan is to fill the stove 
with hard wood (ash is the best for baking), let it burn until thei'O 
18 a good body of heat, and then turn damper so as to throw the 
beat to the bottom of oven for fully ten minutes before the cake is 
put in. In this way a steady heat to start with is secured. Gener- 
^J it is better to close the hearth when the cake is put in, as this 
stops the draft and makes a more regular heat. Keep adding wood 
in amall quantities, for if the heat becomes slack the cake will be 



64 CAKE-MAKINQ. 

heavy. Great care must be taken, for some stoves need to have the 
dampers changed every now and then, but as a rule more heat ia 
needed at the bottom of the oven than at the top. Many test their 
ovens in this way : if the hand can be held in from twenty to thirty- 
five seconds (or while counting twenty or thirty-five), it is a '* quick * 
oven, from thirty-five to forty-five seconds is '* moderate," and from 
forty-five to sixty seconds is " slow." Sixty seconds is a good oven 
to begin with for large fruit cakes. All systematic housekeepers 
will hail the day when some enterprising, practical ''Dixie" girl 
shall invent a stove or range with a thermometer attached to the 
oven, BO that the heat may be regulated accurately and intelligently. 
If necessary to move the cake while baking, do it very gently. Do 
not open the oven door until the cake has had time to form, and 
do not open it oftener than necessary, then be careful to close it 
quickly and gently, so as not to jar the cake. Be sure the outside 
door of the kitchen is closed so that no cold air may strike it. If 
the oven bakes too hard on the bottom, place the grate under the 
pan ; if too hot on top, set a pie-pan of water on the top grate. If 
one side bakes fester than the other, turn wfry gently. Be careful 
not to remove from the oven until done ; test thorfmghly before re- 
moving, for if the cooler air strikes it before it is done, it is certain 
to fall. Allow about thirty minutes for each inch of thickness in 
a quick oven, and more time in a slow one. Test with a broom- 
. splint or knitting-needle, and if the dough does not adhere, it is 
done. Settling away from the pan a little, and stopping its " sing- 
ing/' are other indications that the cake is ready to leave the oven. 
When removed, set the cake, while in the pan, on an inverted sieve 
to cool ; this secures a free circulation of air all round it, and cools 
it evenly. It should remain in the pan at least fifiieen minutes after 
taking from the oven, and it is better to leave the '*cap" on until 
the cake is carefully removed from the pan and set away, alioa/tfg 
right side up. A tin chest or stone jar is best to keep it in. Cofiee 
cake should be put away before it is cold, and so closely wrapped 
in a large napkin that the aroma will not be lost. 

Sponge aSd White Gak£3. 
The good quality of all delicate cake, and especially of spongi^ 
cake, depends very much upon its being made with fresh eggs. It caiL 



CAKE-MAKINO. 65 

aerer be perfect unless pulverized sugar is used. It must be quickly 

put together^ beaten with rapidity, and baked in a rather quick 

OYen. It is made ''sticky" and less light by being stirred long. 

There is no other cake so dependent upon care and good judgment 

in baking as sponge-cake. In making white cake, if not convenient 

to 096 the yolks that are left, they will keep for several days if 

Aorcvghly beaten and set in a cool place. The whites of eggs, when 

not used, must not be beaten, but will keep for several days if set iu 

a oool place. The white or yolk of a medium-sized egg weighs one 

ounce, a fact that it is convenient to know, as sometimes the white 

or yolk of one or more eggs is wanted from several that have been 

put away together. Whenever it is necessary to cut a cake while 

warm, do it with a toarm knife. To prepare cocoa-nut, cut a hole 

through the meat at one of the holes in the end, draw off the milk, 

pound the nut well on all sides to loosen the meat, crack, take out 

meat, and set the pieces in the heater or in a cool, open oven over 

night, or for a few hours, to dry, then grate ; if all is not used, 

sprinkle with sugar (after grating) and spread out in a cool, dry 

place, and it will keep for weeks. 

Angel's Food. 
Use the whites of eleven eggs, one and a half tumbler of sifted 

granulated sugar, one tumbler sifted flour, one tea-spoon of vanilla, 

one tea-spoon of cream tartar; sift the flour four times, then add 

the cream tartar and sift again — but measure it before putting in the 

cream of tartar — sift the sugar and measure it ; beat the eggs to a . 

stiff froth on a large platter ; on the same platter add the sugar 

lightly, then the flour very gently, then the vanilla; do not stop 

beating until you put it in the pan to bake. Bake forty minutes 

in a moderate oven, try with a straw and if too soft let it remain a 

few minutes longer. Do not open the oven until the cake has been 

in fifteen minutes. Turn the pan upside down to oool, and when 

cold, take out by loosening around the sides with a knife, and then 

ice ; nse a pan that has never been greased. The tumbler for meas*

Black Cake. 
One pound powdered white sugar, three-quarters pound butter, 
pound sifted flour (brown or not as preferred), twelve eggs beaten 
separately, two pounds raisins stoned and part of them chopped, 
two of currants carefully cleaned, half pound citron cut in strips, 
quarter ounce each of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves mixed, wine- 
glass wine and one of brandy ; rub butter and sugar together, add 
yolks of eggs, part of flour, the spice, and whites of eggs wel] 
beat«n ; then add remainder of flour, and wine and brandy ; mix 
all thoroughly together; cover bottom and sides of a four-quart 
milk-pau with buttered white paper, put in a layer of the mixture, 
then a layer of the fruit (first dredging the fruit with flour), until 
pan is filled up three or four inches. A small cup of Orleans mO'

the sugar and butter well beaten together, then the milk and soda, 
and the flour and whites of eggs. This cake is rightly named 
** Perfection."— Jfrg. C. Jones, Bradford, Vt 



LAYER-CAKES. 



In bakmg layer-cakes it is important to thoroughly grease the 
tins — to make it emphatic, we will say thoroughly grease and then 
grease again — and after using rub ofi* with a coarse tomel, taking 
care that they are perfectly free from all small particles of cake, 
grease and All again, thus obviating the necessity of washing every 
time they are filled. If jelly is used to spread between the layers, 
it is a good plan to beat it smoothly and spread it before the cakes 
are quite cool. In ** building," an inverted jelly-tin furnishes a 
perfectly level surface on which to lay and spread the cake, and it 
may be allowed to remain on it until perfectly cold, when it should 
be set away in a tin cake-box, in a cool place. In cutting, it is 
better to first make a round hole in the center, with a knife, or a 
tin tube, about an inch and a quarter in diameter. This prevents 
the edge of the cake from crumbling in cutting. In making the 
custard or "filluig" for layer-cake, place in a custard-kettle or in 
a tin pail. Set in boiling water to cook, to avoid all danger of 
.burning. 

To blanch almonds, pour boiling water over them, let stand a 
moment, drain and throw them into cold water, slip ofi* the skins, 
and pound.

tearepoons cream tartar in the flour, one tea-spoon soda in the milk ; 
cream the butter and sugar, add milk gradually, then the whites of 
^gs together with the flour, and bake in jelly-tins. To put between 
layers, take two pounds almonds, blanch and pound fine in a mor- 
tar (or a cloth will do), beat whites and yolks of two e^s together 
lightly, add a cup and a half sugar, then the almonds, with one 
table-spoon vanilla. — Mn, Harvey Wood, 

Almond Cream Cake. 

On beaten whites of ten eggs, sift one and a half goblets pulver- 
ized sugar, and a goblet flour through which has been stirred a 
heaping tea-spoon cream tartar ; stir very gently and do not heat it ; 
hake in jelly-pans. For cream, take a half pint sweet cream, yolks 
of three eggs, table-spoon pulverized sugar, tea-spoon corn starch ; 
dissolve slarch smoothly with a little milk, beat yolks and sugar 
together with this, boil the cream, and stir these ingredients in as 
for any cream-cake filling, only make a little thicker ; blanch and 
chop fine a half pound almonds and stir into the cream. Put to- 
gether like jelly cake while icing is soft, and stick in a half pound 
of almonds split in two. — Mrs. Paris Gibson, Minneapolis, Minn. 

Boston Cream Puffb. 

Pot half pint hot water and two-thirds cup butter over the fire; 
when boiling, stir in one and a half cups flour, and continue stirring 
until smooth and the mixture leaves the sides of the sauce-pan ; 
remove from fire, cool, and beat thoroughly into it five well-beaten 
eggs. Drop on warm greased tins (or a dripping-pan), a table- 
spoon in a place, leaving space between to prevent touching, brush 
over with the white of an egg, and bake ten or fifteen minutes in a 
quick oven. When cakes are done, they will be hollow. When 
cold, slice off* the top, fill space with the cream, and replace top.

Dixie Cream Puffs. 
Five eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, one and a half 
cups each of white sugar and sifted flour, two tea-spoons baking 
powder in the flour ; bake in tea-cups, filling about half full. The 
cream is prepared by placing a small tin pail containing a* pint sweet 
milk in a kettle of boiling water ; beat the whites and yolks of two 
eggs separately ; stir in the milk while boiling, a half tea-cup 
sugar, a large table-spoon corn starch dissolved in a little sweet 
milk, then the beaten yolks and a piece of butter the size of a large 
walnut ; flavor with lemon or vanilla. When done, cut the cakes 
open, put in a spoonful of the cream, place together again, roll in 
the whites, and then in coarse granulated sugar. — 

French Cream Cake. 

Three eggs, one cup granulated sugar, one and a half cups flour, 
two table-spoons cold water, tea-spoon baking powder. This is 
enough for two cakes baked in pie-pans, to be split while warm, 
spreading the hot custard between them, or for four cakes baked in 
jelly-pans, with the hot custard spread between them, the latter 
being the preferable plan. For custard, boil nearly one pint sweet 
milk ; mix two table-spoons com starch with a half tea-cup sweet 
milk, add two well-beaten eggs : when milk has boiled add nearly a 
cup sugar, and add gradually the com starch and eggs, stirring 
briskly; add a half cup butter, stirring until dissolved, flavor with 
one tearspoon vanilla, and spread between cakes while hot. This 
cake can be used as a pudding by pouring over each piece a spoonAil 
of the custard that is left. — Mrs. Charles Morey. 

Golden Cream Cake.

such tins will make twelve dominoes, and if no mpre are required, 
the rest of the batter may be baked in a loaf). The batter in the 
pie-tins should not be more than one-third of an inch deep ; spread 
it evenly, and bake in a quick oven. Have a brown paper nearly

twice the size of the cake on the table, and the moment one of the 
cakes comes from the oven turn it upside down in the center of the 
paper, spread it with a thin layer of currant jelly, and lay the^ other 
cake on it upside down, cut it with a hot, sharp knife lengthwise, 
directly through the center, then divide it across in six equal parts, 
posh them with the knife about un inch apart, and ice them with 
ordinary white icing, putting a large dessertrspooufiil on every piece; 
the heat of the cake will soften it, and with a little help the edgt s 
and sides will be smoothly covered. All of the icing that runs over 
on the paper may be carefully taken up and used again. It must 
then dry, which it' will do very quickly. Make a horn of stiff white 
paper about five inches long, one and a half inches across the top, 
and one-eighth of an inch at the other end ; put in it a dessertrspoon 
of dark chocolate icing, close the horn at the top, and pressing oiit 
the icing from the small opening, draw a line of it acioes the center 
•of every cake, and then make spots like those on^^^vory- dominoes; 
keep the horn supplied with icing. — In Ihe Kttmbn.

more than one and a half cups flour, yolks o^ seven eggs thoroughly* 
beaten, and one whole egg, one tea-spoon allspice, and cinnamon 
until you can taste it ; bake the white in two long pie-tins. Put 
half the gold in a pie-tin, and lay on one pound halved figs (previ 
ously sifted over with flour), so that they will just touch each other; 
pat on the reS of the gold, and bake. Put the cakes together with 
frosting while warm, the gold between the white ones, and cover

Hickory-nut Custard Cak£. 
Cream one pound sugar and half pound butter ; add five eggs 
beaten separately, one cup sweet milk, one pound flour, three tea- 
spoons baking powder, flavor with lemon, and bake in jelly-pans. 
For custard, place one pint milk in a tin pail and set in boiling 
water ; add a table-spoon of corn starch dissolved in a little milk, 
two eggs, one-half cup sugar, two cups chopped hickory-nut meats, 
well mixed together to the boiling milk ; stir, and put between the 
layers of the cake, while both cake and custard are warm. This is 

excellent. 

Rolled Jelly Cake. 

Beat twelve eggs and one pound pulverized sugar together very 
lightly, then stir in three-fourths pound of flour, making batter as 
light as for sponge-cake, and thin enough to spread nicely when 
poured; make up as quickly as possible. Have shallow tin-pans 
prepared (about twelve by eighteen inches and an inch deep) by^ 
lining with thin brown paper, using no grease on pan or paper ; 
pour in batter, spread out \vith a knife as thin as possible (about 
half an inch thick), and bake in solid oven. When done, remove 
from oven, let cool a few minutes, and while still warm, but not 
hot, turn out of pan upside down. With a brush or soft cloth wet 
in cold water, brush over the paper and pull it off*; spread cake 
thin with jelly and roll it up, being careful to place the outer edge 
of roll against something so tliat it will not unroll until cold. 
Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve. If baked in pans such 
as are described above, the recipe will make two rolls, each twelve 
inches long, which should be cut in two, making four rolls. Use 
no b&king-powder, as it makes the cake too brittle. Many use 
none in' sponge-cake. The paper lining should be larger than pan, 
to lift out the cake by taking hold of the projecting edges. This 
jiever fails. — C. W. Cyphers, Minneapolis.

Lady's Fingers. 
One and one-eighth pound of flour, one of powdered sugar, ten

flour one tea-spoon baking-powder and stir slowly. Make a funnel- 
shaped bag of heavy ticking or strong brown paper ; through the 
hole in the small end push a Amnel-shaped tin tube, one-third inch 
in diameter at small end and provided with a flange at the other to 
prevent it from slipping quite through ; tie the small end of bag 
firmly around the tube, and you have a funnel-shaped sack with a 
firm nozzle projecting slightly from the small end. Into this bag 
pour the batter, over which gather up the bag tightly so that none 
will run out, press and run the dough out quickly through the 
tabe into a pan lined with light brown paper (not buttered), mak- 
ing each about a finger long, and about as thick as a lead-pencil, 
being careful not to get them too wide. Sprinkle with granulated 
Bugar, bake in a quick oven, and, when cool, wet the under side 
of the paper with a brush, remove and stick the Angers together

making macaroons and other small cakes. Unsurpassed. — Charles

DIRECTIONS FOR FROSTING. 91 



DIRECTIONS FOR FROSTING. 



Beat whites of eggs to a stiff froth, add powdered sugar grad-' 
oallj, beating well all i1\e lime. (There are various opinions about the 
length of time frosting should be beaten, some giving half an hour, 
others a much shorter time). Or, break the whites into a broad plat- 
ter, and ai once begin adding powdered and sifted sugar, keep add- 
ing gradually, beating well all the while until the icing is perfectly 
smooth (thirty minutes beating ought to be sufficient) ; lastly, add 
flavoring (n>8e, pineapple or almond for white or delicate cake, and 
lemon or vanilla for dark or fruit cake). Have the frosting ready 
when the cake is baked ; beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, 
then stir in ten heaping tea-spoons pulverized sugar (well heaped, 
hut not all that you can lift on the spoon) and one of corn starch ; 
he sure that it is thoroughly beaten before taking the cake from the 
oven. If possible, have some one beating while you take out the 
cake. Now invert a common tin milk-pan, placing it on a clean 
paper, so if any falls off it can be used again, then place the cake 
on the pan and apply frosting ; it will run over the cake, becoming 
as smooth aa glass, and adhere firmly to it. If but ono person is 
engaged in preparing cake and frosting, and must necessarily stop 
beating while getting the cake in readiness, it will be best to beat 
the frosting a few minutes again before placing on cake. As eggs 
vary in sire, some common sense must be used in the quantity of 
the sugar. Practice only will teach how stiff icing ought to be. In 
preparing for a large party, when it is inconvenient to frost each 
cake as it is taken from the oven, and a number have become cold, 
place them in Hie oven U) heat before frosting. If the cake is rough 
or hrown when baked, dust with a little flour, rub off all loose par- 
ticles with a cloth, put on frosting, pouring it around the center of 
the cake, and smooth off as quickly as pos.sible with a knife. If the 
frosting is lather stiff', dip the knife in cold water. If the flavor is 
leraon juice, allow more sugar for the additional liquid. It is nice, 
vhen the frosting is almost oold, to take a knife and mark the cake 
^ slices. Any ornaments, such as gum drope, candies, orange flowers

or ribbons should be put on while the icing is moist. When diy 

ornament with piping, which is a stiff icing squeezed through a 

paper funnel, and may be tinted with colored sugars. If the above 

directions are followed, the icing will not crumble. The recipe for 

" Centennial Drops'' (see index) is excellent for icing. In frosting 

sponge-cake it is an improvement to grate orange peel over the cake 

before frosting. 

Almond FROsriNa. 

Blanch half pint sweet almonds by putting them in boiling 

water, stripping off the skins, and spreading upon a dry cloth 

until cold; pound a few of them at a time in a mortar till well 

pulverized; mix carefully whites of three eggs and threeK][uarter8 

pint powdered sugar, add almonds, fiavor with a tea-spoon vanilla 

or lemon, and dry in a cool oven or in the open air when weather 

is pleasant. 

Boiled Frosting. 

Whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth, one large cup 
granulated sugar moistened with four table-spoons hot water ; boil 
sugar briskly for five minutes or until it "jingles" on the bottom of 
the cup when dropped into cold water, or " ropes" or threads when 
dropped from the end of the spoon. Then, with lefl hand, pour the 
boiling syrup upon the beaten eggs in a small stream, while beat- 
ing hard with right hand. This is an excellent frosting. If pre- 
ferred, add half pound sweet almonds blanched and pounded to a 
paste, or a cup of hickory-nut meats, chopped fine, and it will be 
perfectly delicious. This amount will frx)st the top of two large 
cakes. — Mrs. A. S, C. 

Chocolate Frosting. 

Six rounded table-spoons grated chocolate, one and a half cups 
powdered sugar, whites of three eggs; beat the whites but very 
little (they must not become white), add the chocolate, stir it in; 
then pour in the sugar gradually, beating to mix it well. — In the 
KUchen. 

Frosting. 

Beat whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, add gradually half 
pound best pulverized sugar, beat well for at least half an hour,

whiten the icing). To color a delicate pink, use strawberry , 
currant or cranberry; or the grated peeling of an orange or lemon 
moistened with the juice and squeezed through a thin doth, will 
color a handsome yellow. This amount will frost one large cake.

Frosting with Gelatine. 

Dissolve large pinch gelatine in six table-spoons boiling water; 
strain and thicken with sugar and flavor with lemon. This is 
enough to frost two cakes. — Mrs, W. A, J". 

Frosting without Eggs. 
To one heaping tea-spoon Poland starch and just enough cold 
water to dissolve it, add a little hot water and cook in a basin set in 
hot water till very thick (or cook in a crock; either will prevent its 
burning or becoming lumpy). Should the sugar be lumpy roll it 
thoroughly, and stir in two and two-thirds cups while the starch is 
hot; flavor to taste, and spread on while the cake is a little warm. 
This should be made the day before using, as it takes longer «to 
harden than when made with eggs, but it will never crumble in 
cutting. This is excellent. — Mrs, Ola Kellogg Wilcox. 

Minnesota Frosting. 

Beat whites of three eggs until frothy, not white, add one and a 

third pints powdered sugar gradually with one hand, beating 

briskly with the other. Flavor with a tea-spoon of vanilla. It is 

better not to beat the whites of the eggs until stiff before adding 

sugar, as it makes the icing very hard to dry. — Mrs, C. J,, Winona,

CRULLERS AND DOUGHNUTS. 



To cook these properly the fat should be of the right heat^ 
When hot enough it will cease to bubble and be perfectly still; 
try with a bit of the batter, and if the heat is right the dough 
will rise in«a few seconds to the top and occasion a bubbling in the 
fat, the cake will swell, and the under side quickly become brown. 
Clarified drippings of roast meat are more wholesome to fry them 
in than lard. A good suet may be prepared as follows for those 
who are sensible enough not to like greasy doughnuts or who He- 
braically oppose lard. Use only beef suet, which is quite as cheap, 
cleanly, and healthy. Buy from the meat markets, speaking before 
hand, and securing nice, whole, clean leaves, which cut up in small 
pieces, put into a dinner-pot, which will hold well about ten pounds. 
Put in a pint of water, and after the first hour stir frequently ; it 
takes about three hours with a good heat to render it. Drain 
through a coarse towel, and if the suet is good it will require but 
little squeezing, and leave but little scrap or cracklings. Put to 
cool in pans or jars, and you have an element into which, when well 
heated, you can drop the twisted goodies, with the assurance that 
they will not only be " done brown,'* but that they will emerge with 
a flavor and grain that will commend them to the fiivor of an epi- 
cure. Doughnuts thus cooked are more digestible and of better 
flavor than if co^ed in lard, and the most fastidious will not need 
to peel them b^ve eating. Make the dough as soft as it can be 
hujidled; if cut about half an inch thick, five to eight minutes will 
be time enough to cook, but it is better to break one open as a test. 
When done, drain well in a skimmer, and place in a colander. The 
use of eggs prevents the doygh from absorbing the fat. Doughnuts 
should be watched closely while frying, and the fire must be regU' 



CRULLERS AND BOUOHNTJT& 95 

'%ted very carefully. When you hav^'finished frying, cut a potato 
in slicee and put in the fitt to clarify .k, place the kettle away until 
the &t " settles/' strain into an earthen pot kept for this purpose, 
and set in a cool place. The sediment remaining in the bottom of 
the kettle may be used for soap-grease. Fry in an iron kettle, the 
common skillet being too shallow for the purpose. Do not eat 
doughnuts between April and November. Crullers are better the 
day after they are made. ' If lard is not fresh and sweet, slice a raw 
potato, and fry before putting in the cakes. 



Crullers. 

Two co£fee-cup6 sugar, one of sweet milk, three eggs, a heaping 

table-spoon butter, three tea-spoons baking-powder mixed with six

another cup flour on molding-board, turn the dough out on it, and 

knead until stifl" enough to roll out to a quarter inch thick ; cut 

in squares, make three or four long incisions in each square, lift 

by taking alternate strips between the finger and tnumb, drop 

into hot lard, and cook like doughnuts. — Mrs. A. F. Zieglety Oh

Raised Doughnuts. 

Peel and boil four good sized potatoes ; mash fine, and pour boil- 
ing water over them until of the consistency of gruel; let cool, add 
a yeast cake, and a little flour; let rise till light, then add one pint 
sweet milk, one and a half cups sugar, one-fourth cup (large meas- 
ure) lard, a salt-spoon salt, a little nutmeg and cinnamon ; stir in 
flour until stifi*, let rise again, then add a half tea-spoon soda dis- 
solved in a little milk, pour out on molding board, mix stifi" enough 
to cut out, and roll to half an inch thickness ; cut in long strips two 
inches wide and divide diagonally into pieces three inches long, set 
where it is warm, let rise on the board until light, and then fry. 
These do not cook through as easily as others, and it is safer to drop 
in one, and, by breaking it open, learn the time required for them 
to fry. A very nice variation of this recipe may be made as follows: 
Boll part of the dough about half an inch thick, cut into small 
biscuit, let rise, and when light, roll down a little, lay a few raisins 
rolled in cinnamon in the center, wet the edges by dipping the finger 
in cold water and passing it over them ; draw them together and 
press fimdy, and dirop them in the hot fat. A tea-spoon of apple- 
butter or any kind of jam may be used instead of the raisins. 
When made with the raisins, they are the real German "Oily 
Koeks,"— M«. Jl L. H., 

Berlin Pancakes. 

Roll out dough sligkUy sweetened and shortened, as if for very 
plain doughnuts ; cut in circles like biscuit, put a tea-spoon currant 
jam or jelly on the center of one, lay another upon it, press the 
edges tightly together with the fingers, and fry quickly in boiling

with them hold the trifles in the fat until a light brown. Only one 
can be fried at a time. — JUiss EUie Dalbey, Harrisburg.

QINGER'BREAD, 99 



GINGER-BEEAD. 



' If in making ginger-bread the dough becomes too stiff before it is 
rolled out, set it before the fire. Snaps will not be crisp if made on 
a rainy day. Ginger-bread and cakes require a moderate oven, 
soaps a quick one. If cookies or snaps become moist in keeping, 
put them in the oven and heat them for a few moments. Always 
use New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses, and never syrups. Soda 
is used to act on the '* spirit" of the molasses. In making the old* 
&sliioned, soft, square cakes of ginger-bread, put a portion of the 
dough on a well-floured tin sheet, roll evenly to each side, trim off 
evenlj around the edges, and mark off in squares with a floured 
knife or wheel cutter. In this way the dough may be softer than 
where it is necessary to pick up to remove from board after rolling 
and cutting. Always have the board well covered with flour before 
roUicg all kinds of soft ginger-breads, as they are liable to stick, and 
should always be mixed as soft as they can be handled. 

Ginger Cake with Spice. 

Three eggs, one cup butter, two of Jour, one of sugar, scant half 
cup molasses, with half a tea-spoon soda stirred in it until it foams, 
half a wine-glass of brandy, half a table-spoon of ginger, a half of 
cinnamon, and a half of cloves and allspice mixed. Mix ingredi- 
ents, leaving whites of eggs until last; next to last, molasses. Fruit 
may be added. 

Training Day Ginger-bread. 

One gallon molasses or strained honey, one and a quarter pounds

it stiff enough to roll out; put the molasses in a very large dish, 
add the soda and butter melted, then all the other ingredients; mix 
in the evening and set in a warm place to rise over night ; in the 
morning kn^ad it a long time like bread, roll into squares half an 
mch thick, and bake in bread-pans in an oven heated about right 
for bread. To make it glossy, rub over the top just before putting

mold with flour and cut in cakes. Care must be taken to follow 
these directions implicitly or the cakes will not be good; remember 
to add the lard or bvUer last, and buttermilk, not sour milk, must be 
used; boil the molasses in a skillet, and after pouring it into the 
pan, put the buttermilk in the same skillet, boil and pour it over

CREAMS AND CUSTARDS. 



For creams and custards eggs should never be beaten in tin, btu 
always in stone or eai*then ware, as there is some chemical influence 
about tin which prevents their attaining that creamy lightness so 
desirable. Beat quickly and sharply right through the eggs, beat- 
ing whites and yolks separately. When gelatine is used for creams, 
it is better to soak it for an hour in a little cold water c»r milk, set 
in a warm place ; (it is convenient to place in a bowl set in the 
top of the boiling tea-kettle to dissolve;) when dissolved, pour into 
the hot custard just after removing from the stove. For custards 
the common rule is four eggs, one cup sugar, and one small half 
tea-spoon salt to each quart of milk. Bake in a b&king-dish until 
firm in the center, taking care that the heat is moderate or tlie 
custard will turn in part to whey. The delicacy of the custtird 
depends on its being baked slowly. It is much nicer to strain the 
yolks, after they are beaten, through a tmall wire strainer kept for 
this purpose by every good housekeeper. For boiled custards or 
floats the yolks alone may be used, or for economy's sake the entire 
(^jrgs. Always place the milk to boil in a custard-kettle (made of 
iron with another iron kettle inside, the latter lined with tin), or, 
in a pan or pail set within a kettle of bailing water; when the milk 
reaches the boiling point, which is shown by a slight foam rising 
on top, add the sugar, which cools it so that the eggs will not curdle 
when added. Or, another convenient way is to mix the beaten 
and strained yolks with the sugar in a bowl, then add gradually 
several spoons of the boiling milk, until the eggs and sugar are 

(102) 



CREAMS AND CUSTARDS. 103 

heated through, when they may be slowly stirred into the boiling 
milk. Let remain a few moments, stirring constantly until it 
thickens a little, but not long enough to curdle, then either set the 
pail immediately in cold water or turn out into a cold dish, as it 
curdles if allowed to remain in a hot basin ; add flavoring extracts 
after removing from the stove. Peach leaves or vanilla beans give 
a fine flavor, but must be boiled in the milk and then taken out 
before the other ingredients are added. Boiled custards are very 
difficult to make, and must have the closest attention until they 
are finished. The custards may be prepared as above, mixing the 
milk, eggs and sugar, and then placing in pan to steam instead of 
boiling. 

In making ckarloUe-rus&e it is not necessary to add gelatine. 
The filling may be made of well- whipped cream, flavored and 
sweetened, using a ** whip-chum " or the " Dover Egg-beater " to 
do the whipping. Fill the mold (which should be first wet with 
cold water for c?iarlotte-ni8se and blane mange^ and all creams) 
and set on ice to harden. If preferred, it may be made up in 
several small molds, one for each person. In the use of spices it 
IB well to remember that allspice and cloves are used with meats, 
and nutmegs and cinnamon in combination with sugar. The white 
part of lemon rind is exceedingly bitter, and the outer peel only 
should be used for grating. A better way is to rub the rind off 
with hard lumps of sugar. The sugar thus saturated with the oil 
of the lemon is called '^ zest," and is used, pounded fine, for creams, 

etc. 

Bohemian Creams. 

One quart cream, two table-spoons sugar, one ounce gelatine 
soaked in water until dissolved ; whip half the cream (rich milk 
may be substituted for cream) to a stiff froth ; boil the other half 
with the sugar and a vanilla bean until a flavor is extracted (or 
vanilla extract may be added just after it is removed from the fire), 
take ofi* the fire, add the gelatine, and when cooled a little stir in 
the weU-beaten yolks of the four eggs. As soon as it begins to 
thicken, stir steadily until smooth, when add the whipped cream, 
beating it in lightly. Mold and set on ice until ready to serve. 

To flavor with strawberries, strain two pounds berries through a

colander, sweeten to taste, add to the dissolved gelatine, set on ioe, 
and when it thickens stir until smooth, add the whipped cream ajs 
above, and mold. 

To flavor with peach, boil a dozen and a half choice fruit, sweeten

To flavor with pine-apple, cut fine, boil with half a pound pul%

stead of fresh. In all these never add whipped cream until the 
mass is cool and begins to thicken. — Mrs. W. B. Jones, PUUburghy Pa. 

Charlottk-Russe. 
Cut stale s]X)nge-cake into slices about half an inch thick and 
line three molds with them, leaving a space of half an inch be- 
tween each slice ; set the molds where they will not be disturbed 
until the filling is ready ; take a deep tin pan and fill about one- 
third full of either snow or pounded ice, and into this set another 
pan that will hold at least four quarts. Into a deep bowl or jmil 
(a whip-churn is better) put one and a half pints of cream (if the 
cream is thick tiike one pint of cream and a half pint of milk), 
whip to a froth, and when the bowl is full, skim the froth into the 
pan which is standing on the ice, and repeat this until the cream is 
all froth ; then with the spoon draw the froth to one side, and you 
will find that some of the cream has gone back to milk ; turn 
this into the bowl again, and whip as before ; when the cream is 
all whipi^ed, stir into it two-thirds cup powdered sugar, one tea- 
spoon vanilla, and half a box gelatine, which has been soaked in 
cold water enough to cover it for one hour and then dissolved in 
boiling water enough to dissolve it (about half a cup), stir from the 
bottom of the pan until it begins to grow stiff; fill the molds and 
set them on the ice in the pan for one hour, or until ihey are sent 
to the table. When ready to dish them, loosen lightly at the sides 
and turn out (Jn a flat dish ; have the cream ice-cold when you be- 
gin to whip it, and it is a good plan to put a lump of ice into the 
cream while whipping it. — M. Parloa.

froth on a sieve, and return to bowl to be re-whipped all that passes 
through. When cream is difficult to whip, add to it and beat with 
it the white of an egg. Sweetened and flavored this is a choice 
dessert alone, but it may be served in various ways. Baked apples, 
and fresh or preserved berries are delicious with it. Jelly-glasses, 
one-third full of jelly and filled up with cream, make a very whole- 
some and delicious dessert. 

Whipped Cream. 

One and one-half pints good rich cream sweetened and flavored 

to taste, three tea-spoons vanilla ; whip to a stiff* froth. Dissolve 

three-fourths ounce best gelatine in a small tea-cup hot water, and 

when cool pour into the cream ; stir thoroughly, pour in molds and 

set on ice, or in very cool place. — Mn. Emma Craig, Wdsking- 

Urn, D. a 

Apple Custard. 

One pint of mashed stewed apples, one pint sweet milk, four eggs, 
one cup sugar and a little nutmeg; bake slowly. — Mrs. O, W. 
Hensd, QuarryviUe Pa, 

Apple 8now. 

Pare, core and bring to boil in as little water as possible six tart 
apple oool, strain, boat well, and add the well-whipped whiter 
of three Qggf^, sweeten to taste, beat well until a dish of snow 
is the result, flavor with lemon or manilla, or add the grated 
rind of a lemon ; serve with sweetened cream. Or, make custard of 
folks, sugar, and a pint milk, place in a dish, and drop the froth 
OD it in large flakes. — Mrs. T. J, BuxUm, Minneapolis, 3finn. 

Blanc-Mange. 
Dissolve three heaping table-spoons com starch and three of sugar 
in one pint of milk ; add to this three eggs well beaten, and pour 
the mixture into one pint of boiling milk, stirring constantly until 
it boils again ; just before taking from the stove flavor to suit the 
taste and pour into cups or small molds ; when cool take out and 
place on a glass dish with a mold of jelly in the center. Serve a 
spoon of jelly and a sauce of sweetened cream with each mold. Or, 
put one quart milk (reserving three table-spoons with which mix 
three heaping table-spoons corn-starch) with a pinch of salt and five

table-spoons sugar. When milk is hot, pour in the mixed corn- 
starch, and stir until it is a thick batter ; pour this on the well- 
beaten whites of four eggs, add two tea-spoons vanilla, pour into 
molds wet in cold water, and set on ice ; when cold, turn from the 
mold, and serve in a custard made as follows : Put one pint milk in 
a basin over boiling water, mix in a tea-cup two even tea-spoons 
corn-starch in two of cold milk, beat in the four yolks of eggs and 
two and a half table-spoons of sugar. When the milk is hot pour 
part of it into the cup and stir well, pour it back into the basin and 
stir until as thick as desired ; put on ice until chilled thoroughly. 
Blanc-mange may be colored green with spinage juice, or pink with 
the juice of strawberry, currant or cranberry, or a handsome yellow 
with the grated peel of an orange or lemon, moistened with the 
juice and strained through a cloth. Very pretty half-pint molds 
may be made as follows : Tilt the mold in a pan of snow or pounded 
ice, color one-fourth the blanc-mange pink, another fourth green ; 
wet the molds and pour into them a little of the colored blanc- 
mange, putting only one color into each mold and filling it so that 
when tilted the blanc-mange reaches nearly to the top and covers 
about two-thirds of the bottom ; when cold set mold level, and fill 
with the white blanc-mange, which has, meantime, been kept in so 
warm a place as not to harden. K .the molds are made to imitate 
roses or fruit, the fruit may be green, and roses pink ; if com, yel- 
low ; and various ways of combining colors and forms will suggest 
themselves to the ingenious housewife. 

Chocolate Blai^c-Manoe. 

Half box gelatine, soaked till dissolved in as much cold water as 
will cover it, four ounces sweet chocolate grated, one quart sweet 
milk, one cup sugar ; boil milk, sugar and chocolate five minutes, 
add gelatine, and boil five minutes more, stirring constantly ; flavor 
with vanilla, put in molds to cool and eat with cream. If wanted 
for tea, make in the morning ; if for dinner, the night before. For 
a plain blanc-mange omit the chocolate. — Mrs. Dr. HougtoUy Urbann. 

Raspberry Blano-Mange. 

Stew nice fiesh raspberries, strain off the juice and sweeten it to 
taste, place over the fire, and when it boils stir in com starch wet

in cold water, allowing two table-spoons of com starch for each pint 

of juice ; continue stirring until sufficiently cooked, pour into molds 

wet in cold water and set away to cool ; eat with cream and sugar. 

Other fruit can be used instead of raspberries. — Mrs. J. P, Rea, 

MinneapoliB, Minn. 

Boiled Custard. 

One quart milk, two table-spoons corn starch, two eggs, one-fourth 
tea-spoon salt, butter size of a hickory-nut ; wet the starch in a litt!") 
of the milk, heat the remainder to near boiling, in a tin pail set in 
a pot of boiling water. The proper heat will be indicated by a froth 
or film rising to the top ; add the starch till it thickens, stirring con- 
stantly, then add the eggs well-beaten with four table-spoons of 
sugar, let it cook, stirring briskly, take off and beat well; flavor; 
served with grated cocoa-nut it is elegant. 

Chocolate Custakd. 
Break two sections chocolate in a half-dozen pieces, put it in a 
pan over boiling water, with milk enough t<> barely cover it ; mash 
and stir perfectly smooth, then add the rest of the milk (one quart 
in all, reserving three table-spoons in which to dissolve the corn 
starch,) one cup sugar, yolks of six eggs, a heaping table-spoon corn 
starch ; beat the yolks, add the sugar and corn starch (dissolved in 
milk), stir all slowly in the boiling milk, in which the chocolate is 
dissolved, add a pinch of salt, and let cook a few minutes, stirring 
constantly ; eat cold with white cake. — Miss Bumie Johnson. 

Floating Island. 
Make a custard of the yolks of six eggs, one quart milk, a small 
pinch of salt, sugar to taste ; beat and strain yolks before adding to 
the milk ; place custard in a large tin pan, and set in stove, stirring 
emwtanily until it boils, then remove, flavor with lemon or rose, and 
pour into a dish (a shallow, wide one is best), spread smoothly over 
the boiling hot custard the well-beaten whites, grating some loaf- 
sugar (some add grated cocoa-nut) on the top. Set the dish in a 
pan of ice- water and serve cold. Some prepare the whites by placing 
a table-epoon at a time on boiling water, liiling them out carefully, 
when cooked, with a skimmer and laying them gently on the float 
This is the " old reliable recipe."— Jlfr». W. W. W. 



110 CREAMS AND CUSTARL& 

Good Baked Custard. 
Eight well-beaten eggs, leaving two whites for the top, three pints 
milk ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; bake for two hours in a slow oven. 
Beat the reserved whites to stiff froth with two table-spoons sugar> 
spread over the top and return to oven to brown. 

Gelatine Custard. 
To one-third package Coxc'-j gelatine, add a little less than one 
pint boiling water ; stir until gelatine is dissolved, add the juice of 
one lemon, and one and a half cups sugar; strain through a jelly- 
strainer into dish for th(» table, and set in a cool place. For custard, 
to one and a half pints milk add the yolks of four eggs (reserving 
the whites), and four table-spoons sugar; cook and flavor when cool. 
When required for the table, cut gelatine into small squares, and 
over them pour the custard. Add four table-spoons powdered sugar 
to the whites of four eggs well beaten, and when ready for the 
table place over the custard with a spoon. — Afr«. W. A, James, 

Lemon Custard. 
Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are white, add pint boiling 
water, the rinds of two lemons grated, and the juice sweetened to 
taste ; stir this on the Are till it thickens, then add a large glass of 
rich wine, and one-half glass brandy ; give the whole a good boil, 
and put in glasses. To be eaten cold. Or, put the thin yellow 
rind of two lemons, with the juice of three, and sugar to taste, into 
one pint of warm water. As lemons vary in size and juiciness, the 
exact quantity of sugar can not be given. Ordinary lemons re- 
quires three gills. It will be safe to begin with that quantity, more 
may be added if required. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, then 
the yolks; then beat both together, pour in gradually while beat- 
ing the other ingredients; put all in a pail, set in a pot of boiling 
water, and stir until thick as boiled custard ; strain it in a deep 
dish ; when cool place on ice. Serve in glasses. — Mr%. Belle J2. 

Liggetty DetraUy MUh. 

Snow Custard. 

Half a package of Coxe's gelatine, three eggs, two cups of sugar, 

juice of one lemon ; soak the gelatine one hour in a tea-cup of cold 

water, add one pint boiling water, stir until thoroughly dissolved. 



€BEA3£S AND CVSTARDS. Ill 

add two-thirds of the sugar and the lemon juice ; beat the whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth, and when the gelatine ia quite cold, whip 
it into the whites, a spoonful at a time, from half an .hour to an 
hour. Whip steadily and evenly, and when all is stiff, pour in a 
mold, or in a dozen egg-glasses previously wet with cold water, and 
set in a cold place. In four or five hours turn into a glass dish. 
Make a custard of one and one-half pints milk, yolks of eggs, and 
remainder of the sugar, ilavor with vanilla, and when the meringue 
or snow-balls are turned out of the mold, pour this around the 
base. — Mn Chv. Thayer, Wyoming TerriJUyry. 

Moonshine. 
This dessert combines a pretty appearance with palatable flavor, 
and is a convenient substitute for ice-cream. Beat the whites of six 
eggs in a broad plate to a very stiff froth, then add gradually six 
table-spoons powdered sugar (to make it thicker use more sugar up 
to a pint), beating for not less than thirty minutes, and then beat 
in about one heaping tablespoon of preserved peaches cut in tiny 
bits (or some use one cup jelly), and set on ice until thoroughly 
chilled. In serving, pour in each saucer some rich cream sweetened 
and flavored with vanilla, and on the cream place a liberal portion 
of the moonshine. This quantity is enough for seven or eight per- 
son^. — Mn, H. C Meredith, 

Orange Float. 

One quart water, the juice and pulp of two lemons, one cofiee- 

cap sugar; when boiling, add four table-spoons com starch, let boil 

fifteen minutes, stirring all the time ; when cold pour it over four 

or five peeled and sliced oranges, and over the top spread the beaten 

whites of three eggs ; sweeten and add a few drops of vanilla. — 

Mn, Wm, Skinner. 

Hidden Mountain. 

Six eggs, a few slices citron, sugar to taste, three-quarters of a 

pint of cream, a layer of any kind of jam ; beat the whites and 

yolks of the eggs separately, then mix and beat again, adding the 

dtron, the cream and sugar; when well beaten put in a buttered 

pan and fry, cover with the jam and garnish with slices of citron ; 

to be eaten cold. — Mr9, J, C, OotUd, 






112 CREAMS AND CUSTARDS, 

Orange Souffle. 
Peel and sliee six oranges, put in a glass dish a layer of oranges, 
then one of sugar, and so on until all the orange is used, and let stand 
two hours ; make a soft boiled custard of yolks of three eggs, pint 
of milk, sugar to taste, with grating of orange peel for flavor, and 
pour over the oranges when cool enough not to break dish ; beat 
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, stir in sugar, and put over the 
pudding. Praised by all. — Mrs. Mary A. lAvermjore^ Melrose, Mas8, 

Prune Whip. 

Sweeten to taste and stew three-quarters of a pound of prunes; 
when perfectly cdd, add the whites of four eggs beaten stiff; stir all 
of this together till light, put in a dish, and bake twenty minutes ; 
when cold, serve in a larger dish, and cover well with good cream. 

Virginia Caramel Custard. 

To make a baked custard, separate the whites and yolks of five 
eggs, beat the yolks well with a quarter of a pound of sugar, add 
the well-beaten whites and mix well with a quart of milk. Flavor 
and then pour into a buttered mold. Set immediately into a pan 
of boiling hot water, in a moderately hot oven. About half an 
hour will be required to set it firmly. When nicely browned and 
pufied up, touch the middle with a knife blade ; if it cuts as smooth 
as around the sides it is done ; take care not to overdo. Let cus- 
tard stand imtil perfectly cold, turn out gently on a plate and dust 
thickly with sugar, place in upper part of a hot oven ; the sugar 
Boon melts and browns. Another way is to butter the mold care^ 
fully, sprinkle sugar over bottom and set on stove to brown (great 
care is necessary to prevent sticking), pour in custard and bake ; 
when turned out the caramel will be on top. 

A thinner custard may be made with a less number of eggs, but 
it can not be carameled unless baked in individual cups. Less 
eggs may also be used by substituting a portion of corn starch, 
boiled rice, gelatine or something else to give firmness, but the 
quality of custard will be impaired. And if more than one or two 
additional eggs are used the custard is spoiled. Baking too rap- 
idly, or too long, injures custard, hence do not scald milk and eggs 
before setting in oven, as many recommend. By baking in boiling 
water the temperature is regular, and scorching prevented. 



CONFECTIONERY. 



There are very few modem kitchens in which some cooking uten- 
sil may not be found convenient for making candy. A sauce-pan 
of tinned iron, with a handle and flaring sides, and a lip to facilitate 
the pouring of the contents, will be found best adapted to such use ; 
or a small iron or brass kettle will do if kept quite dean. 

Dissolve four pounds white sugar in one quart water ; place this 
in a porcelain kettle over a slow fire for half an hour, pour into it 
a small quantity of gelatine and gum-arabic dissolved together ; all 
the impurities which rise to the surface skim off at once. Instead 
of gelatine and gum-arabic, the white of an egg may be used as a 
substitute with good results. To make the clarifying process still 
more perfect, strain through a flannel bag. To make rock candy, 
boil this syrup a few moments, allow to cool, and crystallization 
takes place on the sides of the vessel. To make other candies, 
bring the syrup very carefully to such a degree of heat that the 
"threads," which drop from the spoon when raised into the colder 
air, will snap like glass. When this stage is reached, add a tea- 
spoon of vinegar or cream tartar to prevent "graining," and pour 
into pans as directed in the recipes which follow. To make round 
stick candies, pull, and roll into shape with well-floured hands as 
soon as cool enough to be handled. In pulling candy, some grease 
the hands, others flour them slightly. Colored candies are often 
injurious, and sometimes even poisonous, and should be avoided. 

Id baking macaroons and kisses, use washed butter for greasing 
the tins, as lard or salt butter gives an unpleasant taste. Bake in

a moderate oven, or let dry in a cool oven for two hours. After 
buttering, sprinkling lightly with flour and then shaking it off, is 
an exoellent way to prepare the pan. When powdered almonds 
are to be used, they should be thoroughly dried in an open oven, 
after blanching, and they will pulverize more easily. In niAking 
macaroons or drops, or pulling butter-scotch or taffy, grease hands 
lightly with butter to prevent sticking. Flouring the hands is apt 
to give an unpleasant taste to candy. 



Almond Macaroons. 
Pour boiling water on half a pound almonds, take skins off and 
throw into cold water for a few moments, then take out and pound 
(adding a table-spoon essence lemon) to a smooth paste, add one 
pound of pulverized sugar and whites of three eggs, and work the 
paste well together with back of spoon ; dip the hands in water and 
roll mixture into balls the size of a nutmeg, and lay on buttered 
paper an inch apart ; when done, dip the hands in water and pass 
gently over the macaroons, making the sur&ce smooth and shining; 
set in a cool oven three-quarters of an hour. If this recipe is 
strictly followed, the macaroons will be found equal to any made 
by professional confectioners. — Mrs. L. 8. W. 

BUTTER-SCOTOH. 

Three pounds ''cofiee A" sugar, fourth pound butter, half tear 
spoon cream tartar, eight drops extract of lemon ; add as much 
cold water as will dissolve the sugar ; boil without stirring till it 
will easily break when dropped in cold water, and when done, add 
the lemon; have a dripping-pan well buttered and pour in one- 
fourth inch thick, and when partly cold, mark off in squares. If 
pulled, when partly cold, till very white, it will be like ice-cream 
candy. — Mrs. J. 8. R. 

Baltimore Kisses. 

Beat the whites of four small eggs to a high, firm froth, stir into 
it half a pound pulverized sugar, flavor with essence lemon or rose, 
continue to beat until very light ; then drop half the size of an egg» 
and a little more thdn an inch apart, on well-buttered letter-paper; 
lay the paper on a half-inch board and place in a moderate oven; 
watch, and as soon as they begin to look yellowish take them out;

or, beat to a stiff froth the whites of two eggs, stirring into them 
Tery gradually two tea-cups powdered sugar and two table-spoons 
com starch; bake on buttered tins fifteen minutes in a warm oven, 
or until slightly brown. Chocolate puffs are made by adding two 
ounces grated chocolate mixed with the corn starch. — Mrs. W. W. W. 

Candy of any Flavor. 
Three and a half pounds refined sugar, one and a half pints 
water, one tea-spoon cream tartar ; mix in a vessel large enough to 
hold the candy when expanded by the heat ; boil over a brisk fire, 
taking care that it does not bum. The heat should be applied at 
bottom and not at the sides. After boiling fifteen minutes, remove 
a small portion of the melted sugar with a spoon, and cool by 
placing in a saucer set in cold water. When cool enough, take a 
portion between thumb and finger, and if it forms a "string" or 
"thread" as they are separated, the process is nearly done, and 
great care must be used to control the heat scf that the boiling may 
be kept up without burning. Teat frequently by dropping a bit into 
cold water placed near; if it becomes hard and brittle, snapping 
apart when bent, it is done and must be removed at once, and the 
flavoring stirred in. Then pour into shallow earthen dishes, thor- 
oughly but lightly greased, and cooled until it can be handled ; 
pull, roll into sticks or make into any desired shape. 

Centennial Drops. 
White of one egg beaten to a stiff froth, quarter pound pulver- 
iaed sugar, half tea-spoon baking-powder ; flavor with lemon ; butter 
tins and drop with tea-spoon about three inches apart ; bake in a 
slow oven and serve with ice-cream. This is also a very nice recipe 
for icing. — Mins Alice Trimble, Mt. Gilead 

Chocolate Caramels. 
One cup of chocolate shaved fine, one cup molasses, half cup 
milk, one cup sugar; when nearly done add a piece of butter size 
of a wahiut Stir until perfectly dissolved, but not after it begins 
to boil, as that will make it grain. It is done when it hardens and 
becomes brittle wlien dropped in cold water, but do not make too 
bard. Grease plates with butter, pour it on about half an inch 
tbick, when nearly cool cut with a greased knife into small squares.

Chocolate Caramels. 

One and a half cups grated chocolate, four of brown sugar, one 
and a half of cold water, piece of butter size of an e^^, table-spoon 
of very sharp vinegar ; flavor with two table-spoons vanilla just 
before removing from fire. Do not stir, but shake the vessel gently 
while cooking. Boil on the top of stove over a brisk fire until it 
becomes brittle when tried in water ; pour into a well buttered and 
floured dripping-pan, and check off" in squares while soft. — ^^s» 
Emma Collins, 

Chocolate Drops. 

Two and a half cups pulverized or granulated sugar (or maple 
sugar may be used), one-half cup cold water; boil four minutes, 
place the sauce-pan in cold water, and beat till cold enough to make 
into little balls; take half a cake of Baker's chocolate, shave ofi* 
fine and set it in a bowl set in top of boiling tea-kettle to melt, and 
when balls are cool enough, roll in the chocolate with a fork. This 
makes eighty. Or while making into balls, mold an almond-meat 
into the center of each ball, roll in coarse sugar, and you have deli- 
cious ** cream almonds." Or, mold the unbroken halves of walnut- 
meats into the soft sugar, and when cold, roll in the chocolate. 
When finished, take out and lay on buttered paper until cold. —

Everton Ice-cream Candy. 

Squeeze the juice of one large lemon into a cup. Boil one and 

one-half pounds moist white sugar, two ounces butter, one yid a 

half tea-cups water, together with half the rind of the lemoi][, and 

when done (which may be known by its becoming quite crisp when

dropped into cold water) set aside till the boiling has ceased, and 
then stir in the juice of the lemon, butter a dish and pour in about 
an inch thick. When cool take out peel (which may be dried), 
pull until white, draw out into sticks and check about four inches 
long with a knife. If you have no lemons, take two table-spoons 
vinegar and two tea-spoons lemon extract. The fire must be quick 
and the candy stirred all the time. — J/rs. J. S. R, 

Hickory- NUT Macaroons. 
Take meats of hickory-nuts, pound fine and add mixed ground 
fipice and nutmeg ; make frosting as for cakes, stir meats and spices 
in, puttiug in enough to make it convenient to handle ; flour the 
hands and make the mixture into balls the size of nutmegs, lay them

Horehound Candy. 
Boil two ounces of dried horehound in a pint and a half water for 
about half an hour ; strain and add three and a half pounds bix^wn 
sugar. Boil over a hot fire until it is sufficiently hard, pour out in 
flat, well-greased tin trays, and mark into sticks or small squares 
with a knife, as soon as it is cool enough to retain its shape. 

Lemon Candy. 
Take a pound loafsugar and a large cup water, and after cooking 
over a slow fire half an hour, clear with a little hot vinegar, take 
off the scum as it rises, testing by raising with a spoon, and when 
the '' threads" will snap like glass pour into a tin pan, and when 
nearly cold mark in narrow strips with a knife. Before pouring into 
the pans, chopped cocoa-nut, almonds, hickory-nuts, or Brazil-nuts 
cut in slices, may be stirred into it. — Mrs, F. K, W. 

Meringues. 
Qge pound granulated sugar, whites of nine eggs. Whip eggs 
until dish can be inverted without their fsilling ofi*, and then simply

possible. Prepare boards three-fourths of an inch tliick, to fit oven, 
and cover them with strips of heavy brown paper about two and 
a half inches wide; on these drop the mixture from the end of a 
dessert-spoon (or use the meringue-bag described in recipe for lady's 
fingers), giving the meringue the form of an eggy and dropping them 
about two inches apaH on the p:iper, and bake till a light brown. 
Take up each strip of paper by the two ends, turn it gently on the 
table, and with a small spoon take out the soil part of each me- 
•ringue, strew over them some sifted sugar, and return to oven bot- 
tom side up to brown. These shells may be kept for weeks. When 
wanted for table, fill with whipped cream, place two of them together 
80 as to inclose the cream, and serve. To vary their appearance, 
finely-chopped almonds or currants may be strewn over them before 
the sugar is sprinkled over, and they may be garnished with any 
bright-colored preserve. Great expedition is necessary in making 
them, as, if the meringues are not put into the oven as soon as the 
sugar and eggs are mixed, the former melts, and the mixture runs 
on the paper instead of keeping egg-shape. The sweeter the me- 
ringues are made the crisper will they be ; but if there is not sufiS- 
cient sugar added they will be tough.— 3/wd Sarah OiUy Columbus^ 

Molasses Candy. 

Take equal quantities brown sugar and Orleans molasses (or all 
molasses may be used), and one table-spoon sharp vinegar, and when 
it begins to boil skim well and strain, return to the kettle and con- 
tinue boiling until it becomes brittle if dipped in cold water, then 
pour on a greased platter. When cool enough, begin to throw up 
the edges and work, by pulling until bright and glistening like 
gold ; flour the hands occasionally, draw into stick size, rolling to 
keep round, until pulled out and cold. With a greased knife press 
nearly through them at proper lengths, and they will easily snap ; 
flavor just before pouring out to cool. — Sterling Bolnnson. 

Aunt Top's Nut-Taffy. 

Two pints maple sugar, half pint water, or just enough to difr*

meats, and pour the taffy over them. — EsteUe and Hattie JSusk, 



CANNING FRUITS. 



deanse the cans thoroughly and test to see if any ]eak or are 
cracked. If tin cans leak, send them to the tinner ; if disoolored 
inside they may be lined with writing-paper just before using. In 
buying stoneware for canning purposes, be sure that it is weU glazed, 
as fruits canned in jars or jugs imperfectly glazed sometimes become 
poisonous. Never use defective glass cans, but keep them for storing 
things m the pantry ; and in buying them, take care that they are 
free from flaws and blisters, else the glass will crumble off in small 
particles when subjected to heat. Self-sealers are very convenient, 
bat the heat hardens the rubber rings, which are difficult to re- 
place, so that in a year or two they are unfit for vuse. For this 
reason many prefer those with a groove around the top for sealing 
with wax or putty. The latter is very convenient, as jars sealed 
with it can be opened readily with a strong fork or knife, and are 
much more easily cleaned than when wax-sealed. Putty may be 
bought ready for use, and is soon made soil by molding in the 
hand. In using it should be worked out into a small roll, and 
pressed firmly into the groove with a knife, care being taken to 
keep it well pressed down as the can cools. In canning, provide 
a wide-mouthed ftinnel (made to set into the can), and pour the 
fruit into a funnel from a bright tin dipper (if old or rusty it will 
discolor the fruit) or a small pitcher, heated before^putting in the 
hot firuit to prevent breaking. Pour fi^it as quickly as possible, 
and screw down top immediately. 

Fruit should be selected carefully, and all that is imperfect re- 
jected. Large fruits, such as peaches, pears, etc., are in the best

condition to can when not quite fully ripe, and should be put up 
as soon as possible after picking ; s<mall fruits, such as berries, 
should never stand over night if it is possible to avoid it. The 
highest-flavored and longest-keeping fruits are best put up without 
paring, after having carefully removed the down with a fine but 
stiff brush. Use only the best sugtir in the proportion of half a 
pound of sugar to a pound of good fruit, varying tlie rule, of course, 
with the sweetness of the fruit. Or, in canning for pies omit sugar, 
as the natural flavor is better preserved without it, and some prefer 
this method for all purposes. It is economical, and well worthy of 
experiment. Cans put up in this way should have a special mark so 
as to distinguish them from the rest. When ready to can, first place 
the jars (glass) in a large pan of warm water on the back of the stove, 
make ready the syrup in a nice clean porcelain kettle, add the fruit 
— it is better to prepare only enough fruit or syrup for two or three 
cans at a time — and by the time it is done, the water in the pan 
will be hot and the cans ready for use. Take them out of the 
water and set them on a hot plattex^which answers the double pur- 
pose of preventing their contact with any cold sur&ce like the table, 
and saving any fruit that may be spoiled. Fill as full as possible, 
and set aside where no current of air will strike them ; or, better, 
wring out a towel wet in hot water and set them on it ; let stand a 
moment or two or until wiped ofl*, when the fruit will have shrunk 
away a little; fill up again with hot syrup, or if you have none, 
boiling water from the tea-kettle will do, and then seal. In can- 
ning peaches, the flavor is improved by adding two or three whole 
peaches, or dropping in the ceTiter of the can a few of the stones. 
For peaches, pears and berries, some sweeten as for eating, let 
stand until sugar is dissolved (using no water), place on stove in 
porcelain kettle and keep at Inciting point long enough to heat the 
fruit, and then can in glass jai-s as directed. 

There are several other ways of preparing glass cans for fruit, 
among them the following : Wring a towel from cold water, double 
and wrap closely about and under the can so as to exclude the air, 
and put a cold silver spoon inside and fill ; or, put a towel in a 
steamer, set in the cans, and place over a kettle of cM water, boil 
the water, and when ready to fill, remove the cans and wrap in a 



CANNING FRUITS. 121 

towel wrong from warm water, put a table-spoon rinsed in hot 
water inside, and fill ; or, wash the cans in tepid water, place an 
iron rod ins^ide, and at once pour in the boiling fruit, but not too 
fiist In using gla«s cans with tops which screw on, be sure that 
the rubbers are firm and close-fitting, and throw away all that are 
imperfect. When the can is filled to overflowing, put on the top 
at once and screw down tightly, and &s the fruit and cans cool, 
causing contraction of the glass, turn down again and again until 
perfectly air-tight. Wrap as soon as cold with brown wrapping- 
paper, unless the fruit-cloi^et is very dark. Light injures all 
fruit, but especially tomatoes, in which it causes the formation of 
citric acid, which no amount of sugar will sweeten. The place 
where canned fruits are kept should also be dry and cod, for if 
too warm the fruit will spoil. In canning, use a porcelain-lined 
kettle, silver fork or broom splint and wire spoon or dipper; 
a steel fork discolors the fruit. 

Cans should be examined two or three days after filling, and if 
syrup leaks out from the rim, they should Ije unsealed, the fruit 
thoroughly cooked and kept for jam or jelly, as it will have lost 
the delicacy of color and flavor so desirable in canned fruits. Pint 
cans are better for berries than quart. Strawberries keep their 
color best in stone jars; if glass cans are used for them, they should 
be buried in sand. If syrup is left after canning berries, it may, 
ffhile thin, be flavored with vinegar, boiled a moment, and then 
bottled and corked for a drink mixe<l with ice- water. 

In using self-sealing cans the rubber ring must show an even 
edge all round, for if it slips back out of sight at any point, air 
will be admitted. On opening tin cans, remember to ix)ur aU the 
fruit out into an earthen or glass dish. If any part is not used at* 
the time, re-cook, and return to dish, and it will keep for a day or 
two, many of the loss perishable fruits longer. Wines, cider, shrubs, 
etc., must be bottled, well corked, sealed, and the bottles placed on 
their sides in a box of sand or sawdust. To can maple syrup, pour 
hot into cans or jugs, and seal well. 

The fine du^play of canned fruits at the Centennial Exhibition 
was prepared as follows : The fruits were selected with great care, 
of uniform size and shape, and all perfect. They were carefully 



122 



CANNINO FRUITS, 



peeled with a thin, sharp, silver fruit-knife, which did not dbcdor 
them, and immediately plunged into cold water in an earthen or 
wooden vessel to prevent the air from darkening them. As soon 
as enough for one can was prepared, it was put up bj laying the 
fruit piece by piece in the can, and pouring syrup, clear as crystal, 
over it, and tjien, after subjecting the whole to the usual heat, 
sealing up.

Canned Berries. 

Select those the skins of which have not been broken, or the 

juice will darken the S3rrup; fill cans compactly, set in a kettle of 

oold water, with a cloth beneath them, over an even heat; when 

sufficiently heated, pour over the berries a syrup of white sugar 

dissolved in boiling water (the richer the better for keeping, though 

not for preserving the flavor of the fruit), cover the cans closely to 

retain heat on the top berries. To insure full cans when cold, have 

extra berries heated in like manner to supply the shrinkage. If 

the fruit swims, pour off surplus syrup, fill with hot fruit, and 

itcal up as soon as the fruit at the top is thoroughly scalded. — Iffisft 

L. Southwick. 

Plain Canned Berrebs. ^ 

Pick out stems or hulls if any — ^if gathered carefully the berriea 

will not need washing, put in porcelain kettle on the stove, adding 

a small tea-cup water to prevent burning at first. When they 

come to a boil, skim well, add sugar to taste (for pies it may be 

omitted), let boil five minutes, fill in glass, stone, or tin cans, and 

seal with putty unless self-sealers are used. This rule applies to 



CANIONQ FRUITS, 123 

raspberries, blackberries, currants, gooseberries, or any of the 

small berries. 

Canned Cukrants. 

Look over carefully, stem and weigh, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every one of fruit; put in a kettle, cover, and leave to heat slowly 
and stew gently for twenty or thirty minutes ; then add the sugar, 
and shake kettle occasionally to make it mix with iruit ; do not 
allow to boil, but keep as hot as possible until sugar is dissolved, 
then pour in cans and secure covers at once. White currants are 
beautiful preserved in this way. — Maryland mdhod. 

GSEEN GOOSEBEKEOES. 

Cook the berries in water until white, but not enough to break 
them ; put into cans with as little water as possible, fill up the can 
^ith boiling water and seal ; when opened pour off water and cook 
like fresh berrias. — Mrs, 0. M. 8, 

Canned Grapes. 

Squeeze pulp from grapes, boil skins and pulp in water until each 
seem tender ; then pass pulp through a sieve, add skins and the water in 
^hich they are cooked (only a little water should be used in cook- 
ing them) ; add a large coffee-cup of white sugar to a quart of 
grapes, boil until quite thick, and can in glass according to general 
directions. — Mrs. A. C, B., Jacksonville, 

Canned Quinces and Apples. 

Quarter them, and if large, eighth them; cook separately in 
water to cover till they can be pierced with a (silver) fork ; to a 
quart of the mixed juice take one pint sugar, and when boiling add 
quinces and apples, half and half , or whatever proportion you vish; 
cook until of a clear red look, then place in jars; fill with juice, run 
a silver spoon down the sides of the can to let all air escape ; add 
more juice to overflowing, and seal at once. 

Canned Peaches Steamed. 

To peel, place in a wire basket, to the handle of which a cord 
has been tied, let down into boiling water for a moment, then into 



124 CANNING FR UITS, 

cold water, and strip off the skin (this saves both fruit and labor). 
The fruit must be at a certain stage to be prepared in this way, for 
if too green it will not peel, and if too ripe it will be too much 
softened by the hot water. Afler peeling, seed and place in a 
steamer over a kettle of boiling water, first laying a cloth in bottom 
of steamer ; fill about half full of fruit, cover tightly, make a syrup 
in a porcelain kettle for fruit alone, let the fruit steam until it can 
be easily pierced with a silver fork, drop gently for a moment into 
the hot syrup, place in the cans, fill, cover, and seal. The above 
recipe is for canning a few at a time. This recipe, with the excep- 
tion of mode of peeling, applies equally well to pears. 

Canned Peaches. 
Pare, halve and seed ; make a syrup of a pint granulated sugar 

to a quart water, place on stove in a porcelain kettle (enough for 

two quart cans). When syrup boils, drop in enough fruit for one 

can ; watch closely, testing with a silver fork, so that the moment 

they are done they may be removed. When the peaches are tender, 

lift very gently with a wire spoon, and place in the can previously 

heated, according to instructions for preparing glass cans. When 

full of peaches pour in the hot syrup, place the cover on and seal 

at once ; then add more peaches to the hot syrup tor next can, and 

repeat the o|)eration. If there are more peaches than will fill the 

can, place them in another can and keep hot until more are ready, 

and so on until all are canned. Skim the syrup before adding 

peaches, making only enough syrup at one time for two cans. — • 

Mrs. W. W. W. 

Canned Pears. 

Prepare and can precisely like peaches in preceding recipe, except 
that they require longer cooking. When done they are easily pierced 
with a silver fork. 

Canned Pie Plant. 

Cut the pie plant in pieces, two inches long, put over a slow fire 
with its weight in sugar ; when sugar is dissolved let it boil slowly 
until clear, but do not let it cook long enough to become dark col- 
ored. Put up in air-tight cans. 

Canned Pine- Apple. 
Peel and slice, make syrup in proportion of two and a half pounds 



CANNING FRUITS. 126 

beet white granulated sugar to nearly three pints of water ; boil five 
minates ; skim or strain ; add fruit and let it boil ; have cans hot ; 
fill and seal up as soon as possible. 

Canned Plums. 
Wash and put whole into a syrup made in the proportion of a 
pnt of water and a pound of sugar to every two pounds of fruit ; 
boil for eight minutes, can, and seal immediately. If pricked with 
a fork before placing in syrup, they will be less liable to burst. 
Cherries are canned in the same way. 

Raspberries with Currant Juice. 
Ten pounds of red or black raspberries, twelve pounds of granu* 
lated sugar, one quart currant juice. Make syrup of the sugar and 
juice; when boiling add the fruit, and continue for ten minutes. 
Put in glass cans and &sten immediately. 

Canned Strawberries. 
Fill glass jars with fresh whole strawberries, sprinkled with sugar 
in the proportion of half pound sugar to a pound of berries, lay 
covers on lightly, stand them in a wash boiler filled with water to 
^thin an inch of tops of cans (the water must not be more than 
milk-warm when the cans are placed in it). When it has boiled 
fer fifteen minutes, dpiw to back of stove, let steam pass ofi*, roll 
the hand in a towel, lift out cans, and place on a table. If the 
berries are well covered with their own juice, take a table-spoon and 
fill up the first can to the very top of the rim from the second, wipe 
the^neck, rub dry, and screw the top down firmly, observing care- 
fully the general directions for canning berries. Fill another from 
the second can, and so on until all are finished. Great care must be 
taken to keep the berries whole and round ; as the cans cool invert 
them occasionally, to prevent the fruit from forming in a mass at 

one end. 

Canned Strawberries. 

For every quart of fresh strawberries, take one coffee-cup of white 

sugar; add a table-spoon or two of water to the fruit if there is no * 

juice in the bottom, to prevent burning before the heat brings out 

the juice. As soon aa the fruit boils, add the sugar, and stir 

gently for a few minutes until it boils up again, and can immedi- 



126 CANNING FRUITS, 

ately. It is better not to cook any more fruit than can he put 
into one glass fruit-jar. Usually a few spoonfuls of the syrup will 
be left with which to begin the next can. Strawberries are consid- 
ered difficult to keep, but there need be no trouUe if the fruit is 
fresh and the can is closed air-tight in glass, and kept as directed 
in geueral directions for canning fruits. — Mrs, H. 8. Huntington, 

Galeeburg, 111, 

Canned Corn. 

Dissolve an ounce tartaric acid in half tea-cup water, and take 
one tablespoon to two quarts of sweet corn ; cook, and while boil- 
ing hot, fill the cans, which should be tin. When used turn into a 
colander, rinse with cold water, add a little soda and sugar while 
cooking, and season with butter, pepper and salt — Miss lAda Cart- 

mell. 

Canned Corn and Tomatoes. 

Scald, peel, and slice tomatoes (not too ripe^ in the proportion 

of one-third corn to two-thirds tomatoes ; put on in a porcelain 

kettle, let boil fifteen minutes, and can immediately in tin or glass 

(if glass keep in the dark). Some take equal parts of com and 

tomatoes, preparing them as above. Others, after cutting the com 

from the cob, cook it twenty minutes, adding a little water and 

stirring often, then prepare the tomatoes as above, cooking in a 

separate kettle five minutes, and then adding them to the com in 

the proportion of one-third corn to two-thirds tomatoes, mixing well 

until they boil up once, and then canning immediately. — Mrs, D. 

Buxton, 

String-Beans. 

String fresh string-beans, break in several pieces, cook in boiling 

water ten minutes, and can like tomatoes. — Mrs, L, W. C, Oin- 

c'umati. 

Canned Tomatoes. 

The tomatoes must be entirely fresh and not overripe ; pour over 
them boiling water, let stand a few minutes, drain ofi^, remove the 
skins, and slice crosswise into a stone jar, cutting out all the hard 
or defective portions ; cook for a few minutes in their own juice, 
skimming off the scum which rises, and ^stirring with a wooden 
spoon or paddle ; have the cans on the hearth fille<i with hot water; 



CANNINO FRUITS. 127 

empty, and fill with hot tomatoes; ^vipe moisture from tope with 
soft cloth, put on and secure covers. If tin cans are used, press 
down covers, and pour hot sealing wax into grooves. If put up 
in glass, set away in a dark place. Either tin, glass or stone cans 
may be used, and all may he sealed with putty instead of wax, it 
being more convenient. (See general instructions for canning fruit) 

Canned Watermelon. 

Cut rind of ripe melons (first cutting off all green parts) into 
flmaU pieces two or three inches long, and boil until tender enough 
to pierce with fork ; have a syrup made of white sugar, allowing 
half pound sugar to a pound fruit ; skim out melon and place in 
syrup together with a few pieces of race ginger, let cook a few 
minutes, put in cans and seal hot. 

Warranted Canned Strawberries. 

Pat fi>ur pounds white sugar in a kettle, add a teacup cold 
water, let boil till perfectly clear, then add four quarts nice ber- 
ries. Boil ten minutes, keeping them covered with syrup, but 
avoid stirring in order to preserve their good appearance. Take 
out berries with a small strainer or skimmer, place in a crock and 
let the syrup boil ten minutes longer, then pour it over berries, 
aad, when cool, fill the cans, putting a tablespoon of good brandy 
on top of each can, screw on lid tightly, and put in a dry dark 
place. This method is the only means of preserving the peculiar 
flavor of the strawberries. To prevent the second handling, put 
the hot berries in the cans (instead of the crock) till about three 
quarters frill. When syrup has boiled, fill each can with it, let stand 
till cool, then cover with the tablespoon of brandy (take out a little 
juice if necessary) and screw on the lid. 

If after two or three weeks the least fermentation appears, put 
the cans in a boiler (on a small board to prevent contact with 
bottom), fill with cold water nearly to top of cans, loosen the lids, 
but do not take them off, let water boil for a little while, then take 
oot cans, HglUen the covers and the berries will keep over a year. 
Folly ripe currants and acid cherries canned in same manner, one 
pound of sugar to one of dressed fruit, are delicious. They never 
need a second boiling if carefully prepared. 



CATSUPS AND SAUCES. 



Always select perfect fruit; cook in porcelain, never in metal. 
In making catsup, instead of boiling, some sprinkle the tomatoes 
with salt and let them stand over night, then strain and add spioee, 
etc., and a little sugar. Bottle in glass or stone, and never use tin 
cans ; keep in a cool, dry, dark place. If, on opening, there is a 
leathery mold on top, carefully remove every particle of it, and the 
catsup will not be injured. To prevent this molding, some do not 
fill the bottles quite to the top with catsup, but fill up with hot 
vinegar. If there are white specks of mold all through the catsup 
it is spoiled. If, on opening and using a part, there is danger that 
the rest may sour, scald, and, if too thick, add vinegar. Sauces 
should always be made with great care in a pan set in hot water, 
having the sauce pan dean if a delicate flavor is desired, especially 
if the sauce is drawn butter. Butter and those sauces containing 
eggs should never boil. Wooden spoons must be used for stirring. 
An excellent thickening for soups, sauces and gravies is prepared 
as follows : Bring butter just to the boiling point in a small stew- 
pan, dredge in flour, stirring together until well cooked. This, 
when not cooked brown, is ** White Eoux," and when browned, 
*' Brown Roux." Thin this with a part of the soup, sauce or gravy, 
and add it to the whole, stirring thoroughly. The flour may be 
browned before using if intended for brown gravies or sauces. 
Melted butter may be used in place of oil in all recipes where the 
latter is named. 

Mint, when used in recipes, usually means "spearmint" of 
*^ green mint,** though pennyroyal and peppermint are of the same

fisonily. The young leaves of from one to six inches in length are 
the parts used. It grows on any good garden soil, but comes for- 
ward earlier in a warm, sunny spot. It is propagated by cuttings 
or dividing the roots of old plants in the spring, is very prolific, 
and ought to find a place in eVery garden. Those who have con- 
aervatories should keep a root in pots, to use with spring lamb be^ 
fore the leaves would appear in the open air. Mint leaves for 
drying should be cut irom the stalks just before the plant blossoms, 
and spread out thinly in some dry, shady place, where they can 
dry slowly. When dry, put up in paper bags and keep in a dry 
place until wanted. 

Cucumber Catsup. 

Three dozen cucumbers and eighteen onions peeled and chopped 
very fine ; sprinkle over them three-fourths pint table-salt, put the 
whole in a sieve, and let drain well over night; add a tea-cup mus- 
tard seed, half tea-cup ground black pepper ; mix well, and cover 
with good cider vinegar. — Mrs. Hattie CleinjnoiiSy AsheviUe, N. C 

Currant Catsup. 
Four pounds nice fully-ripe currants, one and a half pounds 
sngar, table-spoon ground cinnamon, a tea-spoon each of salt, 
ground cloves and pepper, pint vinegar ; stew currants and sugar 
antil quite thick, add other ingredients, and bottle for use. 

Gooseberry Catsup. 
Nine pounds gooseberries, h\e pounds sugar, one quart vinegar, 
three table-spoons cinnamon, one and a half each allspice and cloves. 
The gooseberries should he nearly or quite rii)e. Take ofi^blossomsy 
wash and put them into a porcelain kettle, mash thoroughly, scald 
and put through the colander, add sugar and spices, boil fifteen 
mmutes, and add the vinegar cold ; bottle immediately before it 
cools. Ripe grapes prepared by same rule, make an excellent cat- 
sup. — Mrs. Col. W. P. Reid, Delaware^ Ohio. 

Tomato Catsup. 

Half bushel tomatoes, four ounces salt, three ounces ground black 

pepper, one ounce cinnamon, half ounce ground cloves, one drachm

burning; then add the vin^ar with which a small tea-cup sugar and 
Che spices have been mixed, boil up twice, remove from fire, let

half a dozen medium-sized ones, peeled and sliced, fifteen minutes 
before the vinegar and spices are put in. —Mrs. M. M. Mtm8eU» 
DdoMJcaret 

ToBiATO Catsup. 

Take one bushel of firm ripe tomatoes — ^the Feejee Island, known 
by their pink or purple color, and the ''Trophy," are the best and 
richest varieties for catsup and canning. Wipe them ofi* nicely with 
a damp cloth, cut out the cores, and put them in a porcelain-lined 
iron kettle or a genuine bell-metal one. Place over the fire, and 
pour over them about three pints of water, throw in two large 
handfiils of peach leaves, with ten or twelve onions or shallots cut fine. 
Boil until the tomatoes are done, which will take about two hours: 
then strain through a coarse-mesh sieve, pour the liquid back again 
into the boiling kettle and add half a gallon of good strong cider 
vinegar; have ready two ounces ground spice, two ounces ground 
black pepper, two ounces mustard (either ground or in the seed, as 
you prefer), one ounce ground cloves, two grated nutm^, two 
pounds light brown sugar, and one pint of salt ; mix these ingre- 
dients well together before putting in the boiler ; then boil two 
hours, stirring continually to prevent buniing. If you like the 
jcatsup "hot," add cayenne pepper to your taste. When cool, fill 
bottles (reeded bottles are the nicest, they can be procured at the 
house furnisher's, and a set will last some time ; they look better 
than ones of all sizes and styles). Cork and seal with bottle-wax 
so as to exclude the air. Keep in a cool, dry place for future use. 
This recipe is preferred to all others — it has been used for years. 
It keeps well, and has been pronounced by competent judges supe* 
lior to all others. — G. D., BaHimore, Mi.

Bread Sauce. 
Place a diced onion and six pepper-corns in half a pint of milk 
over l)oiling water, until onion is perfectly soft ; pour it on half a 
pint of bread crumbs without cinist, and leave it covered for an 
hour ; beat it smooth, add pinch of salt, and two table-spoons 
butter rubbed in a little flour; add enough sweet cream or milk 
to make it the proper consistency, and boil a few minutes. It, 
must be thin enough to pour. — Mrs. J. L. T., Denver, CoL 

Bread Sauce. 

Half pint grated bread crumbs, one pint sweet milk, and one 
onion; boil until the sauce is smooth, take out onion and stir in 
two spoons butter with salt and pepper; boil once and serve with 
roast duck or any kind of game. — Mrs. H. C. E. 

Cranberry Sauce. 

After removing all soft berries, wash thoroughly, place for about 
two minutes in scalding water, remove, and to every pound fruit 
add three-quarters of a pound granulated sugar and a half pint 
water; stew together over a moderate but steady fire. Be careful 
to cover and not to gtir the fruit, but occasionally shake the vessel, or 
apply a gentler heat if in danger of sticking or burning. If atten- 
tion to these particulars be given, th^ berries will retain their shape 
to a considerable extent, which adds greatly to their appearance on 
the table. Boil from five to seven minutes, remove from fire, turn 
into a deep dish, and set aside to cool. If to be kept, they can be put 
up at once in air-tight j^rs. Or, for strained sauce, one and a half 
pounds of fruit should be stewed in one pint of water for ten or 
twelve minutes, or until quite soft, then strained through a colander 
or fine wire sieve, and three-quarters of a pound of sugar thoroughly 
stiired into the pulp thus obtained; after cooling it is ready for use. 
Serve with roast turkey or game. When to be kept for a long time, 
without sealing, more sugar may be added, but its too free use 
impaurs the peculiar cranberry flavor. For dinner-sauce half a 
pound is more economical, and really preferable to three-quarters, 
as given above. It is better, though not necessary, to use a por- 
celain kettle. Some prefer not to add the sugar till the fruit is 
almost done, thinking this plan makes it more tender, and preserves 
the color better.— 0. O. & E. W. Orane, CMweU, N. J. 



132 CATSUPS AND SA UOES. 

Celery Sauce. 
Scrape the outside stalka of celery and cut in pieces an inch long, 
let stand in cold water half hour, then put in boiling water enough 
to cover, and cook until tender ; drain off water and dress with 
butter, salt, and milk or cream, thickened with a little flour : Or» 
make a dressing by adding to half pint milk or cream, the weU- 
beaten yolks of two eggs, a bit of butter, and a little salt and 
pepper or grated nutmeg; bring just to boiling point, pour over 
6tewed celery, and serve with roast duck. — Mrs. A. WiUon. 

Cream Sauce. 

Heat one table-spoon butter in a skillet, add a tea-spoon flour, 

and stir until perfectly smooth, then add gradually one cup of cold 

milk, let boil up once, season to taste with salt and pepper, and 

serve. This is very nice for v^etables, omelets, fish, or sweet 

breads. 

Curry Powder. 

An ounce of ginger, one of mustard, one of pepper, three of cori- 
ander seed, three of turmeric, one-half ounce cardamom, quarter ounce 
cayenne pepper, quarter ounce cumin seed ; pound all fine, sift and 
cork tight. One tea-spoon of powder is sufficient to season any thing. 
This is nice for boiled meats and stews. — Mrs. C. FvUington. 

Cmu Sauce. 

Twelve large ripe tomatoes, four ripe or three green peppers, two 

onions, two table-spoons salt, two of sugar,, one of cinnamon, three 

cups vinegar ; peel tomatoes and onions, chop (separately) very fine, 

add the peppers (chopped) with the other ingredients, and boil one 

and a half hours. Bottle and it will keep a long time. Stone juga 

are better than glass cans. One quart of canned tomatoes may be 

used instead of the ripe ones. This Chili sauce is excellent and 

much better and more healthful than catsups. — Mrs. E. W. Het' 

rickj 

Caper Sauce. 

To a pint of drawn butter, add three table-spoons of capers* 
Serve with boiled or roast mutton. Another method is the follow- 
ing: Fifteen minutes before the mutton is done, melt two table- 
spoons butter in a sauce-pan, stir into'it one table-spoon flour ; whes 
thoroughly mixed add half a pint of the liquor in which the mui 



CATSUPS AND 8A UCES. 188 

ton is boiling, and half a pint of milk, season with pepper and salt, 
cook a few minutes (to swell the grains of the flour), and just be- 
fore serving (in order that their color may not be lost by standing) 
add two heaped table-spoons capers. 

Caper Butter. 
Chop one table-spoon of capers very fine, rub through a sieve 
with a wooden spoon, and mix them with a salt-spoon of salt, 
quarter of a salt-spoon of peppor, and one ounce of cold butter. 
Put a layer of this butter on a dish, and serve fish on it. 

Drawn Butter. 
Rub a small cup of butter into half a table-spoon flour, beating it 
to a cream, adding, if needed, a little salt; pour on it half a pint 
boiling water, stirring it fast, and taking care not to let it quite boil, 
as boiling makes it oUy and unfit for use. The boiling may be pre- 
vented by placing the sauce-pan containing it in a larger one of boil- 
ing water, covering and shaking frequently until it reaches the 
boiling point. A great variety of sauces which are excellent to eat 
with fish, poultry, or boiled meats, can be made by adding different 
herbs, such as parsley, mint, or sweet marjoram, to drawn butter. 
First throw them into boiling water, cut fine, and they are ready to 
be added, when serve immediately, with two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped fine. This makes a nice sauce to serve with baked fish. 
The chopped inside of a lemon with the seeds out, to which the 
chicken liver has been added, makes a good sauce for boiled chicken. 
For anchovy sauce, add two tea-spoons of anchovy extract or paste 
(kept by all grocers) to a half pint of drawn butter sauce, and 
8tir well. For lobster sauce, chop the meat of the tail and claws 
of a good-sized lobster into pieces (not too small). Half an hour 
before dinner, make half a pint of drawn-butter, add the chopped 
lobster, a pinch of coral, another of cayenne, and a little salt. 
When done it should not be a solid mass, but the pieces of lobster 
should appear distinctly in the thin cream. 

Greek Tomato Sauce. 
Cut up two gallons of green tomatoes; take three gills black 
mustard seed, three table-spoons dry mustard, two and a half of 
Uack pepper, one and a half allspice, four of salt, two of celery

a half quarts good vinegar, a little red pepper to taste. Beat the 
»pices and boil all together until well done. 

HOLLANDAISE SaUCE. 

Beat half a tea-cup butter in a bowl to a cream, add yolkp of two 
eggs, one bj one, then juice of half a lemon, a pinch of cayenne 
pepper, half a tea-spoon salt; place this in a sauce-pan of boiling 
water, beat with an egg l>eater, fbr a minute or two, until it begins 
to thicken, then add one-half cup of boiling water, beating all the 
time. When like soft custard it is done. It will take five minutes 
to cook if the bowl is thin and the water boils all the time. 

Lemon Sauce. 

Cut three slices of lemon into very small dice, and put them into 
drawn butter, let it come just to boiling point, and pour over boiled 
fowls. 

Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Mix in a two-quart bowl one even tea-spoon ground mustard, one 
of salt, and one and a half of vinegar ; beat in the yolk of a raw 
egg, then add very gi'adually half a pint pure olive-oil (or melted 
butter), beating briskly all the time. The mixture will become a 
very thick batter. Flavor with vinegar or fresh lemon-juice. 
Closely covered it will keep for weeks in a cold place, and is 
delicious. 

Mint Sauce. 

Take fresh, young mint, strip leaves from stems, wash, drain on 
a sieve, or dry them on a cloth ; chop very fine, put in a sauce- 
tureen, and to three heaped table-spoons mint add two of pounded 
sugar; let remain a few minutes well mixed together, and pour over 
it gradually six table-spoons of good vinegar. If members of the 
family like the flavor, but not the substance of the mint, the sauce 
may be strained after it has stood for two or three hours, pressing 
it well to extract all the flavor. It is better to make the sauce an 
hour or two before dinner, so that the vinegar may be impregnated 
with the mint. The addition of three or four table-spoons of the 
liquor from the boiling lamb is an improvement.

Oyster Sauce. 
Set a basin on the fire with half pint oysters, from which all bits 
of shell have been picked, and one pint boiling water ; let boil three 
minutes, skim well, and then stir in half a cup butter beaten to a 
cream, with two table-spoons flour ; let this come to a boil, and serve 
with boiled turkey. Or, make drawn butter, add a few drops lemon- 
juice, a tablespoon of capers, or a few drops vinegar, add oysters* 
drained of the liquor, and let come to boiling point. The sauce 
is richer if cream instead of water is used in making the drawn 
butter, but in this case do not add the lemon-juice or vinegar. — 

Onioh Sauce. 
Boil three or four white onions till tender, mince fine ; boil half 
pint milk, add butter half size of an eggy salt and pepper to taste, 
and stir in minced onion and a table-spoon of flour which has been 
moistened with milk. — E, H. W. 

Roman Sauce. 
Put one tea-cup water and one tea-cup milk on fire to scald, and 
when hot stir in a table-spoon flour, previously mixed smooth with a 
very little cold water, add three eggs well beaten and stramed, 
season with salt and pepper, two table-spoons butter and a little 
vinegar ; boil four eggs hard, slice and lay over the dish ; pour over 
sauce, and serve with boiled fish. — Mrs. E. T. E. 

Tartare Sauce. 

Yolks of two eggs, gill of salad-oil (or melted butter), salt-spoon 

salt, half a salt-spoon pepper, a table-spoon good cider vinegar, half 

tea-spoon mustard, a table-spoon of gherkins. Beat together in a 

amall bowl lightly the vinegar and yolks, add to these, drop by drop, 

the salad-oil or melted butter, taking care to stir the same way all - 

the time; when this is done, season the mixture with pepper, salt 

and mustard ; add also the gherkins finely chopped (or capers may 

be substituted), and serve in a gravy boat with boiled salmon or 

cold meats. 

Tomato Sauce. 

Stew ten tomatoes with three cloves, and pepper and salt, for fif-

Prepared Mustard. 

Take three tea-ppoons ground mustard, one of flour (two if the 
mustard seems very strong), half tea-spoon of sugar; pour boiling 
water on these and mix into a smooth, thick paste ; when cold add 
vinegar enough to make ready for use, and serve with salt This 
resembles the French mustard. —ifrs. Mary Herbert Huntington. 

To Prepare Horse-radish for Winter. 

In the fall, mix the quantity wanted in the following proportions: 
A coffee-cup of grated horse-radish, two table-spoons white sugar,

and one of prepared mustard. — From a Sovihem hotLsekeeper. 

Shrimp Sauce. 

Skin a (umbler of shrimps, boil skins in a tumbler of water ; 
strain this water in two-thirds tumbler butter previously rubbed 
into a heaped table-spoon flour, simmer a few minutes, add 
shrimps finely chopped, let stew until done. Little cooking is need-

DRINKS. 



To avoid adulteration, buy coffee in the grain, either raw or in 
nnall quantities freshly roasted. The best kinds are the Mocha and 
Java, and some prefer to mix the two, having roasted them separ 
rately in the proportion of one-third of the former to two-thirds of 
the latter. West India coffee, though of a different flavor, is often 
very good. 

Roast coffee with the greatest care — for here lies the secret of 
success in coffee-making— and in small quantities, for there is a 
peculiar freshness of flavor when newly roasted. Pick over care- 
fully, wash and <lry in :i niodenite oven, increase the heat and roast 
quickly, either in the oven, or on top of the stove or range; in the 
latter case, stir constantly , and i n t he oven stir ofteny with a wooden 
spoon or ladle kept for that pu r pose. The coffee must be thoroughly 
and evenly roasted to a dark rich brown (not black) throughout, and 
must be free from any burnt grains, a few of which will ruin the 
flavor of a large quantity. It must be tender and brittle, to test 
which take a grain, place it on the table, press with the thumb, and 
if it can be crushed, it is done. Stir in a lump of butter while the 
ix>ffee is hot, or wait until about half cold and then stir in a well- 
beaten egg. The latter plan is very economical, as cof!^ so pre- 
pared needs no further clarifying. Keep in a closely-covered tin or 
earthen vessel. Never attempt other work while roasting coffee, 
but give it the entire attention. Do not grind too fine, and only in 
quantities as needed, for the flavor is dissipated if it is long unused 
after grinding, even when under cover. If properly roasted, coffee 
will grind into distinct, hard, and gritty particles, and not into a 
powder.

Physicians say that cofBde without cream is more wholesome, paiv 
ticularly for persons of weak digestion. There seems to be some 
element in the cofiee which, combining with the milk, forms a 
leathery coating on the stomach, and impairs digestion. 

If soft water is used for making tea, tea should be added as soon 
as it boils, as boiling expels all the gases from the water, but if soft 
water can not be had, and hard water is used, boil it from twenty to 
thirty minutes before using. The boiling drives off the gases in 
this case, but it also causes the lime and mineral matters, which 
render the water hard, to settle, thus softening it. 



Making Coffee. 

''One for the pot" and a heaping table-spoon of ground cofiee 
for each person, is the usual allowance. Mix well, either with a 
part or the whole of an egg (or codfish skin, washed, dried, and 
cut in inch pieces, may be used instead of egg)y and enough cold 
water to thoroughly moisten it, place in a well-scalded coffee-boiler^ 
pour in half the quantity of boiling water needed, allowing one 
pint less of water than there are table-spoons of cofiee. Boll a cloth 
tightly and stop up the nose or spout, thus keeping in all the coffee 
flavor. Boil rather fast five minutes, stirrbg down from the top 
and sides as it boils up, and place on back part of stove or range 
where it will only simmer for ten or fifteen minutes longer. When 
ready to serve add the remainder of the boiling water. Or, another 
method of making coffee without clearing, is to stir the cofiee 
directly into the boiling water, boil and simmer as above, then 
pour out a large cupftil, and, holding it high over the pot, pour it 
in again ; repeat this, and set it on stove where it will keep hot, 
without simmering. The coffee will be clear, if instructions are 
carefully followed. Coffee boiled a long time is strong, but not so 
well flavored or agreeable as when prepared as above. 

To keep the coffee-pot or tea-pot thoroughly pure, boil a little 
borax in them, in water enough to touch the whole inside surface, 
once or twice a week, for about fifteen minutes. No dish-water 
should ever touch the inside of either. It is sufiicient to rinse them 
in two or three waters; this should be done as soon after they are 
used as possible ; drun dry, and when ready to use scald out in 



DRINKS. 139 

two waters. These precautions will aid in preserving the flavor of 
the tea and coffee. In selecting coffee, choose that which is dry 
and light ; if it feels dense and heavy it is green. 

Filtered Coffee. 

The French coffee biggin furnishes the easiest means for filtering 
coffee. It consists of two cylindrical tin vessels, one fitting into the 
other ; the bottom of the upper one is a fine strainer, another coarser 
strainer is placed on this with a rod running upwards from its 
center; the finely ground coffee is put in, and then another strainer 
is slipped on the rod, over the coffee, the boiling water is poured 
on the upper sieve and falls in a shower upon the coffee, filtering 
through it to the coarse strainer at the bottom, which prevents the 
coffee from filling up the holes of the finer strainer below it The 
coffee thus made is clear and pure. 

The National Cofl^pot is so widely known as not to need des- 
cription here, but the " gude wife " can improvise one equally as 
desirable and much simpler. Make a sack of fine flannel, or, 
canton flannel, as long as the coffee-pot is deep, and a little larger 
than the top ; stich up the side seam to within an inch and a half 
of the top, bend a piece of small but rather stiff wire in a circle and 
dip it through a. hem made around the top of the sack, bringing 
the ends together at the opening left at the top of the side seam. 
Having put the coffee in the sack, lower it mto tne conee-poi witn 
the ends of the wire next the handle, spread the ends of the wire 
apart slightly, and push it down over the top of the pot. The top 
of the sack will then he turned down a little over the outside of the 
pot, a part of it covering the " nose," and keeping in all the aroma, 
the elasticity of the wire causing it to close tight around the pot, 
holding the sack close to its sides. Instead of a wire (which must 
be removed to wash the sack after using), a tape may be used by 
tying the ends after turning the top of sack down. When the sack, 
with the coffee in it is in its place, pour the boiling water over the 
coffee, close the lid tightly, and let simmer (not boil) fifteen min- 
utes to half an hour. In pouring for the table raise the sack off 
the nose but not out of the pot. This makes good coffee without 
eggg or any thing else to settle it

MAKiya Tea. 

" Polly, put the kettle on, and we II all Uke Tea." 

Of all ''cups that cheer/' there is nothing like the smoking-hot 
cup of tea, made with boUing water, in a tkoroiighiy scalded tea-pot. 
Put into the pot the required amount of tea, pour over it boiling 
water, cover the tea-pot so that no steam may escape, and allow the 
tea to stand and in^se for seven minutes, when it should be poured 
at once into the cups. If allowed to infuse longer than this time, 
which is sufficient to draw out the strength of the leaf, the tannin 
is developed, which gives an acrid, bitter taste, and being a power- 
ful astringent, is destructive to the coating of the stomach. To 
insure "keeping hot" while serving, in a different tea-pot from 
that in which the tea is made, the simple contrivance known as the 
'' bonnet '* is warranted a sure preventive against that most in- 
sipid of all drinks — a warmish cup of tea. It is merely a sack, 
with a loose gathering-tape in the bottom, large enough to cover 
« and encircle the tea-pot, with a small opening to fit the spout, and 
a slit through which the handle will be exposed. IVfake it with odd 
pieces of silk, satin or cashmere, lined, quilted or embroidered ; 
draw this over the tea-pot as soon as the tea is poured into it ; draw 
up the gathering-string tightly at the bottom, and the tea will 
remain piping hot for half an hour. One tea-spoon of tea and one 
tea-cup of hot water is the usual allowance for each person. FteMy 
boiled soft water is the best for either tea or coffee. Always have 
a water-pot of hot water on the waiter with which to weaken each 
cup if desired. Tea should never boil. The most elegant mode of 
serving tea is from the tea-urn, various forms and designs of which 
are made in silver -and plated ware. The best tea-pot is that which 
retains heat longest, and this is a hrigid metal one, as it radiates the 
least heat, but the metal must be kept bright and polished. Serve 
both tea and coffee with the best and richest cream, but in the 
absence of this luxury, a tolerable substitute is prepared as follows : 
Take fresh, new milk, set in a pan or pail in boiling water where it 
will slowly simmer, but not boil or reach the boiling point, stir fre- 
quently to keep the cream from separating and rising to the top, 
and aUow to simmer until it is rich, thick and creamy. In absence

of both cream and milk, the white of an egg beaten to a froth, with 
a small bit of butter well mixed with it, may be used. In pouring 
oofiee, it must be turned on gradually so as not to curdle it. 



Army Coffee. 

Cofiee or tea may be made quickly by placing the required quan- 
tity of cold water in the pot, and adding the coffee, tied up in a^ 
Back of fine gauze, or piece of muslin ; bring to boiling point, boil' 
five minutes and serve. Make tea in the same way, except that 
the tea is put loose in the water, and simply allowed to boil up once. 

Coffee with Whipped Cream. 

For six cups of coffee of fair size, take one cup sweet cream 
whipped light with a little sugar ; put into each cup the desired 
amount of sugar and about a table-spoon boiling milk ; pour the 
coffee over these and lay upon the surface of the hot liquid a large 
spoonful of the frothed cream, giving a gentle stir to each cup be- 
fore serving. This is known to some as meringued coffee, and is an 
elegant IVench preparation of the popular drink. Chocolate served 
m this wav is delicious. — Marion Harland, 

Coffee for One Hundred. 
Take five pounds roasted coffee, grind and mix with six eggs ; 

make small muslin sacks, and in each place a pint of coffee, leaving 

room for it to swell ; put five gallons boiling water in a large cofiee 

urn or boiler having a faucet at the bottom ; put in part of the sacks 

and boil two hours ; five or ten minutes before serving raise the lid 

and add one or two more sacks, and if you continue serving several 

times add fresh sacks at regular intervals, taking out from time to 

time those first put in and filling up with boiling water as needed. 

In this way the full strength of the coffee is secured and the fresh 

supplies impart that delicious flavor consequent on a few momenta 

boiling. 

To make coffee for twenty persons, us6 one and a half pints 
ground cofiee and one gallon of water. — Mrs. C. 8. Ogden. 

Steamed Coffee. , 

Put coffee into the pot, pour the boiling water on it ; place tliis 
pot (which is made to fit) into the top of the tea-kettle, and let 
cook from ten to twenty minutes, while water in kettle is kept 



142 DRINKSL 

boiling all the time. This makes a clear, delicious coffee. Some 
persons hold that by first wetting the coffee with cold water, bring- 
ing it to boiling point, and then pouring in water, more of the strength 
is extracted. 

Vienna Coffee. 

Filter instead of boibng the cofilee, allowing one table-spoon ground 
coffee to each person and '' one for the pot;'* put a quart of cream 
into a custard-kettle or pail set in boiling water, and put it where it 
will keep boiling ; beat the white of an egg to a froth, and mix 
well with three table-spoons cold milk. As soon as the cream is 
hot, remove from fire, add the mixed egg and milk, stir together 
briskly for a minute, and then serve. 

Another method is U) pour boiling water over the coffee, cover 
closely, boil one minute, remove tc the side of the stove a few min* 
utes to settle, and serve. Allow two heaping table-spoons coflee to 
a pint of water. The less time the coffee is cooked the more coffee 
18 required, but the finer the flavor. The late Professor Blot pro- 
tested against boiling the coffee at all, as in his opinion the aroma 
was evaporated, and only the bitter flavor left. 

Chocolate. 

Take six table-spoons scraped chocolate, or three of chocolate and 
three of cocoa, dissolve in a quart of boiling water, boil hard fifteen 
minutes, add one quart of rich milk, let scald and serve hot ; this 
IS enough for six persons. Cocoa can also be made after this recipe. 
Some boil either cocoa or chocolate only one minute and then serve, 
while others make it the day before using, boiling it for one hour, 
and when cool skimming off the oil, and when wanted for use, heat 
it to the boiling point and add the milk. In this way it is equally 
good and much more wholesome. Cocoa is firom the seed of the 
fruit of a small tropical tree. There are several forms in which it 
is sold, the most nutritious and convenient being chocolate, the 
next cocoa, then cocoa nibs, and last cocoa shells. The ground 
bean is simply cocoa; ground fine and mixed with sugar it is choco- 
]ate ; the beans broken into bits are " nibs." The shells are the 
shells of the bean, usually removed before grinding. The beans 
are roasted like coffee, and ground between hot rollers.

Put into a co£fee-pot set in boiling water, one quart of new milk

Bpoons grated chocolate mixed to a paste with cold milk, let it boil 

two or three minutes, and serve at once. To make good chocolate, 

good materials are required. 

Cider. 

Cider should be made from ripe apples only, and for this reason, 
and to prevent fermentation, it is better to make it late in the 
season. Use only the be^t-flavored grafted fruit, rejecting all that 
are decayed or wormy. The best mills crush, not grind, the apples. 
The utmost neatness is necessary throughout the process. Press and 
strain juice as it comes from the press through a woollen cloth into 
a perfectly clean barrel; let stand two or three days if cool, if 
warm not more than a day; rack once a week for four weeks, put 
in bottles and cork tightly. This will make perfect unfermented 
cider. Do not put any thing in it to preserve it, as all so-called 
preservatives are humbugs. Lay the bottles away on their sides in 
sawdust. — C. T. Canon, Ml, Pleasant Farm, 

Bottled Cider. 

Take good sweet cider (if a tart flavor is wished, let it just be- 
g^ to ferment), put on stove, sldm tfumyughly (as the great secret is 
to remove all pumice from the cider), heat to boiling point, but do 
not allow it to boil, and then pour in bottles or jugs and seal while 
hot Some put two or three raisins in each bottle or jug. This 
keeps all winter. It certainly makes a richer drink than when 
fresh, and as cider is pronounced a great remedy for colds, aU 
should know this simple way of keeping it. ^

Lemon Syrup. 
Take the juice of twelve lemons, grate the rind of six in it, let it 

stand over night, then take six pounds of white sugar, and make a 

thick syrup. When it is quite cool, strain the juice into it, and 

SQueeze as much oil from the grated rind as will suit the taste. A 

table-spoonful in a goblet of water will make a delicious drink on a 

hot day, fiir superior to that prepared from the stuff commonly 

sold as lemon syrup. — Miss Abbie O. Backus. 

Iced Tea. 
Prepare tea in the morning, making it stronger and sweeter than 

usual; strain and pour into a clean stone jug or glass bottle, and 
set aside in the ice-chest until ready to use. Drink from goblets 
without cream. Serve ice broken in small pieces on a platter nicely 
garnished with well-washed grape-leaves. Iced tea may be pre- 
pared from either green or black alone, but it is considered an im- 
provement to mix the two. Tea made like that for iced tea (or that 
left in the tea-pot after a meal), with sugar to taste, a slice or two 
of lemon, a little of the juice, and some pieces of cracked ice, 
makes a delightful drink. Serve in {i^lasses. 



EGGS. 



The fresher they are the better and more wholesome, though 
new-laid eggs require to be cooked longer thaa others. Eggs over" 
a week old will do to fry, but not to boil. In boiling, they are less 
likely to crack if dropped in water not quite to the boiling point. 
Eggs will cook soil in three minutes, hard in five, very hard (to 
serve with salads, or to slice thin — seasoned well with pepper and 
salt— and put between thin slices of bread and butter) in ten to 
fifteen minutes. There is an objection to the ordinary way of boil- 
ing eggs not generally understood. The white, under three min- 
utes rapid cooking, is toughened and becomes indigestible, and yet 
the yolk is left uncooked. To be wholesome, eggs should be cooked 
evenly to the center, and this result is best reached by putting the 
eggs into a dish having a tight cover (a tin pail will do), and 
pouring boiling water over them in the proportion of two quarts to 
a dozen eggs ; cover, and set away from the stove ; after cooking 
about seven minutes remove cover, turn the eggs, replace cover, 
and in six or seven minutes they will be done if only two or three 
eggs ; if more, in about ten minutes. The heat of the water cooks 
the eggs slowly to a jelly-like consistency, and leaves the yolk harder 
than the white. The egg thus cooked is very nice and rich. To 
fiy eggs, after fiying ham, drop one by one in the hot fat and dip 
it over them, until the white is set ; dust with pepper and salt, and 
serve hot ; cook from three to five minutes, according to taste. 

Put eggs in water in a vessel with a smooth level bottom, to tell 
good from bad ; those which lie on the side are good, but reject 

10 (146) 



146 EQQ& 

those which stand on end as bad ; or, look through each egg separ 
^ ratelj toward the son, or toward a lamp in a darkened room ; if the 
* white looks dear, and the yolk can be easily distinguished, the egg 
b good ; if a dark spot appears in either white or yolk, it is stale ; 
if they appear heavy and dark, or if they gurgle when shaken 
gently, they are '* totally depraved." The best and safest plan is 
to break each egg in a saucer before using. For preserving eggs 
for winter use, always secure fresh ones ; after packing, cover closely 
and keep in a cool place. 

TO MAKE OMELETS. 

To make an omelet, beat the yolks lightly (twelve beats is said 
to be the magic number), as too much beating makes them thin 
and destroys the appearance of the omelet, then add the milk, the 
salt, pepper, and flour if any is used, and lastly the whites beaten 
to a stiff froth. Have the skillet as hot as it can be without 
scorching the butter ; put in a table-spoon of butter and pour in 
the omelet, which should at once begin to bubble and rise in flakes. 
Slip under it a thin, broad-bladed knife, and every now and then 
raise it up to prevent burning. As soon as the under side is hard 
enough to hold together, and the eggs begin to ''set," fold over, 
shake the skillet so as to entirely free the omelet, carefully slide it 
on a hot platter, and serve at once. It should be cooked in fit>m 
three to five minutes. To bake an omelet, place in the frying-pan 
on top of stove until it begins to *' set" in the middle, then place in 
a rather hot oven ; when slightly browned, fold if you like, or turn 
a hot dish on top of the pan, upset the latter with a quick motion, 
and so dish the omelet with the under side uppermost. It should 
be baked in from five to ten minutes. Where a large quantity of 
eggs are used, instead of making into one large omelet, divide and 
make several, sending each to the table as soon as done. Three 
eggs make a good-sized omelet. Ham, chicken, and all kinds of 
meat omelets, are made by chopping the meat fine and placing 
between the folds before dishing. In making vegetable (asparagus, 
tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.) omelets, cook the vegetables as if for the 
table; place them in the center of the omelet just before folding. 

For a plain, easily-made omelet, take three tsble-spoons milk and

a pioch of salt for eacli egg; beat the eggs lightly for three or four 
minutes, pour them into a hot pan in which a piece of butter the 
aze of a walnut has just been melted, cook three or four minutes, 
fold over and serve at once. Some scald a little parsley, pour off 
the water, chop it, and mix with the omelet just before pouring 
into the pan. Old cheese, grated and added to a plain omelet, is a 
&yorite dish. To make a bread omelet, remove all crust from a 
large slice of light, white bread, moisten with sweet milk, rub 
through a sieve, add to the yolks, beat very thoroughly, and season 
with salt and pepper to taste, adding beaten whites last. 



Boiled Eggs. 

Put them on in cold water, and when it has boiled, the eggs will 

be done, the whites being soft and digestible, as they are not when 

put on in boiling water. 

Baked Eggs. 

Break eight eggs into a well-buttered dish, put in pepper and 
Bah, bits of butter, and three table-spoons cream ; set in oven and 
bake about twenty minutes ; serve very hot. 

Birds' Nest. 

Boil eggs hard, remove shells, surround with force-meat ; fry or 

bake them till nicely browned, cut in halves, and place in the dish

light, one table-spoon of flour mixed into a tea-cup of cream or milk, 
with salt and pepper to taste ; melt a table-spoon butter in a pan, 
pour in the mixture and set the pan into a hot oven; when it 
thickens, pour over it the remaining whites of eggs weU beaten, 
return it to the oven and let it bake a delicate brown. Slip off on 
large plate, and eat as soon as done. — Mrs. W. D. HaUf Hawtey^

Poached Eggs. 

Break and drop them one at a time in salted water, to which 
some add a small lump of butter; some say drop in when simmer- 
ing, others when boiling, not letting it boil again aftier patting in 
the eggs; others have water boiling, salt, then place it where it 
will stop boiling, drop in eggs, and let simmer gently till done. Al- 
ways take great care in keeping the yolk whole. To preserve the 
egg round, muffin rings may be placed in the water, or stir with a 
spoon and drop in the eddy thus made, stirring till egg is cooked. 
To serve them, toast squares of bread three-quarters of an inch 
thick, put a very little melted butter upon each slice, place on a 
heated platter, lay an egg on each square, and sprinkle with pepper 
and salt. Some put a bit of butter on each egg. Serve with Wor* 
eester sauce if desired. Some poach eggs in milk, serving them in

Pickled Egos. 

Pint strong vinegar, half pint cold water, tea-spoon each of cinna^ 
mon, allspice, and mace ; boil the eggs till very hard and take off 
the shell ; put on the spices tied in a white muslin bag, in the cold 
water, boil, and if the water wastes away, add enough so as to leave 
a half pint when done; add tlie vinegar, and pour over the egg^^ 
put in as many eggs as the mixture will cover, and when they are 
used, the same will do for another lot. Or, after boiling (hard) and 
removing shell, place in jar of beet pickles, and the white will be- 
come red ; cut in two in serving. 

Scrambled Egos. 
Li a deep earthen pie-plate, warm sweet milk, allowing two table- 
spoons to each egg (or less, with a large number of eggs), add a bit of 
butter size of a walnut, and a little salt and pepper. When nearly 
to boiling point drop in the eggs, broken one at a time in a saucer ; 
with a spoon or thin-bladed knife gently cut the ^;g8, and scrape 
the mixture up from the bottom of the plate as it cooks. If it begins 
to cook dry and fast at the bottom, move the dish back instantly, for 
success depends wholly on cooking gently and evenly, proportions 
beiog of secondary importance. Take from stove before it has quite 
all thickened, and continue turning it up from bottom of dish a 
moment longer. If served in another dish (it keeps warmer served in 
same) have it well heated. The mixture should jbe in large flakes 
of mingled white and yellow, and as delicate as baked custard. 
Some prefer them scrambled without the milk. — Mrs, L. S. WUlia*

Stuffed Eggs. 

Cut in two, hard-boiled eggs, remove yolks, chop, and mix with 
them chopped cold chicken, lamb, or veal (some add a little minced 
onion or parsley and a few soaked bread-crumbs), season, and add 
gravy or the uncooked yolk of an e^, form, fill in the cavities,

To Keej* Egob. 

Put a two inch layer of salt In bottom of stone jar, then a layev 
of fresh eggs, small end down; then salt, then eggs, and so on till 
jar is full, with a layer of salt at top; cover and put in a cool place, 
but not where they will freeze. This is a simple, easy, and inex- 
pensive way, and has been tested for years. Or, dip the eggs in 
melted wax, or a weak solution of gum, or in flax-seed oil, or rub 
over simply with lard, each of which renders the shell impervious 
to air, and pack away in oats or bran. For one's own use the latter 
is a good method, keeping the eggs perfectly, but it discolors tho 
shells, and renders them unfit for market 

There has always existed a great diflerence of opinion as to which 
end down eggs shoidd be placed in packing for winter use. W. H. 
Todd, the well known Ohio breeder of poultry, gives what seems 
to be a sound reason for packmg them larger end down. He says: 
** The air-chamber is in the larger end, and if that is placed down 
the yolk will not break through and touch the sheU, and thereby 
spoil. Another thing, if the air-chamber is down, the egg is not as 
liable to shrink away. These are two important reasons deducted 
from experiments, and they materially aflect the keeping of eggs." 

Washington Omelet. 
Let one tea-cup milk come to a boil, pour it over one tea-cup 
bread-crumbs and let stand a few minutes. Break six eggs into a 
bowl ; stir (not beat) till well mixed ; then add the milk and bread ;

which a large tablespoon of butter had been melted; fry slowly, 
cut in squares, turn, fry to ajdelicate brown, and serve at once. — 
Mrs, D. Buxton, 

To Preserve Eggs. 

Make a solution of lime in rain-water, and allow the eggs to re- 
main in it for several days. The lime will form a coating over the 
shells and in the pores. Pack the eggs thus prepared in sawdust 
or chopped straw. 



FISH. 



Hah is easier of digestion but less nutritious than meats, if sal- 
mon is excepted, which is extremely hearty food, and should be 
eaten sparingly by children and those whose digestion is not strong. 
Fish must be fresh, the fr^her the better— those being most perfect 
which go straight from their native element into the hands of the 
cook. The white kinds are least nutritious; and the oily, such as 
flalmon, eels, herrings, etc., most difficult of digestion. When fish 
are in season, the muscles are firm and they boil white and curdy; 
when transparent and bluish, though sufficiently bofled, it is a 
sign that they are not in season or not fresh. 

As soon as possible after fish are caught, remove all scales (these 
may be loosened by pouring on hot water), and scrape out entrails 
aDd every particle of blood and the white skin that lies along the 
backbone, being careful not to crush the fish more than is abeo- 
lately necessary in cleaning. Binse thoroughly in cold water, using 
Qoly what is necessary for perfect cleanliness, drain, wipe dry, and 
place on ice until ready to cook. To remove the earthy taste from 
fresh-water fish, sprinkle with salt, and let stand over night, or at 
least a few hours, before cooking; rinse off, wipe dry, and to con> 
pletely absorb all the moisture, place in a folded napkin a short 
time. Fresh-water fish should never be soaked in water except 
when frozen, when they may be placed in ice-cold water to thaw, 
and then cooked immediately. Salt fish may be soaked over night 
in cold water, changing water once or twice if very salt To 
freshen fish, always place it skin-side up, so that the salt may 
have free course to the bottom of pan, where it naturally setties. 



152 FJSK 

Fish should always be well cooked, being both unpalatable and 
unwholesome when underdone. For boiling, a fish-kettle is almost 
indispensable, as it is very difficult to remove a large fish without 
breaking from an ordinary kettle. The fish-kettle is an oblong 
boiler, in which is suspended a perforated tin plate, with a handle at 
each end, on which the fish rests while boiling, and with which it is 
lifted out when done. From this tin it is eiisily slipped off to the 
platter on which it goes to the table. When no fish-kettle is at 
hand, wrap in a cloth, lay in a circle on a plate, and set in the 
kettle. When done the fish may be lifted out gently by the cloth 
and thus removed to the platter. 

In fi-ying by dipping into hot fat or drippings (or olive oil is still 
better), a wire basket in which the fish is placed and lowered into 
the fat, is a great convenience. 

One of the most essential things in serving fish, is to have every 
thing hot, and quickly dished, so that all may go to the table at 
once. Serve fresh fish with squash and green pease, salt fish with 
beets and carrots, salt pork and potatoes and parsnips with either. 

In the East there is a great variety of fish in winter. The 
blue fi{<h is excellent boiled or baked with a stuffing of bread, 
butter and onions. 3ea-bass are boiled with egg-sauce, and gaj> 
nished with parsley. Salmon are baked or boiled, and smelts are 
cooked by dropping into boiling fat. The sheap's-head, which re- 
quires most cooking of all fish, is always stuffed and baked. 

Nearly all the larger fresh fish are boiled, the medium-sized are 
baked or broiled and the small are fried. The verj' large ones are 
cut up and sold in pieces of convenient size. The method of cook- 
ing Avhich retains most nourishment is broiling, baking is next best, 
and boiling poorest of all. Steaming is better than boiling. Li 
baking or boiling place a fish as nearly as possible in the same 
position it occupies in the water. To retain it there, shape like the 
letter "S," pass a long skewer through the head, body, and tail, 
or tie a cord around tail, pass it through body, and tie around the 
head. 

In cooking fish, care must be taken Tiot to use the same knives or 
Bpoons in the preparation of it and other food, or the latter will be 
tainted with the fishy flavor. 



FISH. 153 

In boiling fish, allow five to ten minutes to the pound, according 
to thickness, after putting into the boiling water. To test, pass a 
kuiie along a bone, and if done liie fish will separate easily. Be- 
move the moment it is done,' or it will become '* woolly" and in- 
apid. The addition of salt and vinegar to water in which fish is 
boiled, seasons the fish, and at the same time hardens the water, 
%o that it extracts less of the nutritious part of the fish. In boil- 
iDg fish always plunge it into boiling water, and then set where it 
will simmer gently until done. In case of salmon, put into tepid 
water instead of hot, to preserve the rich color. Garnishes for fish 
are parsley, sliced l)eeU«, fried smelts (for turbot), lobster coral (for 
boiled fish). For hints on buying fij^h, see ** Marketing." 

Baked Fish.

or four pounds* rub the fish inside and out with salt and pepper, fill 
with a stuflSng made like that for poultry, but drier ; sew it up 
and put in a hot pan, with some drij)pings and a lump of butter,

Codfish Balls. 

Soak codfish cut in pieces about an hour in lukewarm water, 
remove skin and bones, pick to small pieces, and return to stove* in

bring to a boil again. Have ready potatoes boiled tender, well 
mashed, and seasoned with butter. Mix thoroughly with the pota- 
toes half the quantity of codfish while both are still hot, form into 
flat, thick cakes or round balls, fry in hot lard or drippings, or dip 
in hot fat, like doughnuts. The addition of a beaten eg'g before 
niaking into balls renders them lighter. Cold potatoes may be used, 
by reheating, adding a little cream and butter, and mixing while 
hot— Jfrj. /. H, Shearer,

Fish Chowder. 
The best fish for chowder are haddock and striped bass, although 
any kind of fresh fish may be used. Cut in pieces over an inch 
thick and two inches square ; place eight good-sized slices of salt pork 
in the bottom of an iron pot and fry till crisp ; remove the pork, 
leaving the fat, chop fine, put in the pot a layer of fish, a layer of 
split crackers, and some of the chopped pork with black and red 
pepper and chopped onions, then another layer of fish, another of 
crackers and seasoning, and so on. Cover with water, and stew 
slowly till the fish is perfectly done ; remove from the pot, put in 
dish in which you serve it and keep hot, thicken the gravy with 
rolled cracker or flour, boil it up once and pour over the chowder. 
Some add a little catsup, port wine and lemon juice to the gravy 
/ just before taking up, but I think it nicer without them. — Mrs,

Fried Fish. 
Clean thoroughly, cut off* the head, and, if large, cut out the 
backbone, and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces ; dip 
in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in a beaten egg, and then in bread 
crumbs (trout and perch should never be dipped in meal), put into 
a thick-bottomed skillet, skin side uppermost, with hot lard or drip- 
pings (never in butter, as it tiikes out the sweetness and gives a bad 
color), fry slowly, and turn when a light brown. The roe and the 
backbone, if previously removed, may be cut up and fried with the 
other pieces. A better way is to dredge the pieces in the flour, 
brush with beaten egg, roll in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard 
or drippings enough to completely cover them. If the fat is very hot^ 
the fish will not absorb it, and will be delicately cooked. When 
brown on one side, turn over in the fat and brown the other, and 
when done let them drain. Slices of large fish may be cooked ua 
the same way. Serve with toinatoe sauce or slices of lemon.

and place in the jar in which it is to be cooked, first a layer offish, 
then the spices, flour and bits of butter sprinkled on, repeating till 
done. Fill the jar with equal parts vinegar and water, cover closely 
with a cloth well floured on top so that no steam can escape, and 
bake six hours. Let it remain in jar until cold, cut in slices, and

Pan-Fish. 

Place in pan with heads together, and fill spaces with smaller fish ; 

when ready to turn, put a plate over, drain off fat, invert pan, and 

the fish will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back in 

the pan, and when hotj slip back the fish, and when the other side is 

brown, drain, turn on plate as before, and slide them on the platter 

to go to the table. This improves the appearance, if not the flavor. 

The heads should be left on, and the shape preserved as ftilly as

FRUITS. 



The arrangement of fresh fruits for the table affords play for the 
most cultivated taste and not a little real inventive genius. Melons, 
oranges, and indeed all kind of fruits, are appropriate breakfast 
dishes; and a raised oenter-piece of mixed fruits furnishes a delicious 
dessert, and is an indispensable ornament to an elegant dinner-table. 
Mek>cs should be kept on ice, so as to be thoroughly chilled when 
served. Clip the ends of water-melons, cut them across in halves, 
set up on the clipped ends on a platter, and serve the pulp only, 
removing it with a spoon ; or, cut across in slices, and serve with 
rind. Nutmeg melons should be set on the blossom end, and cut in 
KvenJ equal pieces from the stem downward, leaving each alternate 
pieoe still attached ; the others may then be loosened, and the seeds 
removed, when the melon is ready to servo- Fruit should be cai^- 
Ailly selected. Havana and Florida oranges are the best, but do not 
l^eep well, and on the whole, the Messina are preferable. A rough 
yeflow skin covers the sweetest oranges, the smooth being more juicy 
Hnd acid ; a greenish tinge indicates that they were picked unripe. 
The Messina lemons, ** November cut," are the best, and come into 
market in the spring. Freestone peaches with yellow meat are the 
bmdsomest, but not always the sweetest. California pears take the 
lead for flavor, the Bartlett being the best. The best winter pear 
is the " Winter Nellis." The " Pound " pear is the largest, but is 
good only for cooking. Fine-grained pears are best for eating. A 
PTramid of grapes made up of Malagas, Dela wares, and Concords, 
makes a showy center-piece and a delicious dessert. The Malaga 
leads all foreign grapes, and comes packed in cork-dust, which is a 
Aon-oonductor of heat and absorbent of moisture, and so is always in

good condition. Of native grapes, the Delaware keeps longest. la 
pine-apples the "Strawberry" is best, while the "Sugar-Loaf 
ranks next, but tliey are so perishable that to keep even for a few 
days they must be cooked. When served fresh they should be cut 
in small squares and sprinkled with sugar. Buy cocoa-nuts cautiously 
in summer, heat being likely to sour th^ milk. In almonds, the 
Princess is the best variety to buy in the shell ; of the shelled, the 
" Jordan " is the finest, though the " Sicily " is good. For cake or 
CDnfecti(mery , the shelled are most economical. In raisins, the * * Seed- 
less "rank first for puddings and fine cakes, but the "Valencia* 
are cheaper, and more commonly used; for table use, loose "Mus- 
catels" and layer raisins (of which the "London Layer" is the 
choicest brand) take the preference. In melons, every section has 
its favorite varieties, any of which make a wholesome and luscious 
dessert dish. Sliced fruits or berries are more attractive and pala- 
table sprinkled with sugar about an hour before serving, and then 
with pounded ice just before sending to the table. An apple-corer, 
a cheap tin tube, made by any tinner, is indispensable in preparing 
apples for cooking. They are made in two sizes, one for crab-apples 
and the other for larger varieties. 

If the market is depended upon select the freshest berries; and 
sometimes it will be found that the largest are not the sweetest. If 
clean, and not gritty, do not wash them, but pick over carefully, 
place first a layer of berries then sprinkle sugar, and so on; set 
away in a cool place, and just before serving sprinkle with pounded 
ice. If they must be washed, take a dish of cold, soft water, pom 
a few in, and with the hand press them down a few times, until 
they look clean, then hull them. Repeat the process till all are 
hulled, sugar and prepare as above. Never drain in a colander. The 
French serve large fine strawberries without being hulled. Pulver- 
ized sugar is passed, the strawberry is taken by the hull with the 
thumb and finger, dipped into the sugar, and eaten. When berries 
are left, scald for a few minutes ; too much cookmg spoils the flavor. 
Some think many of the sour berries are improved by digkUy cook- 
ing them with a little sugar before serving. If a part of the berries 
are badly bruised, gritty, etc. (but not sour or bitter), scald, and 
drain them through a fine sieve without pressing them. Sweeten

Ambbobia, or Fruit Salad. 

Six sweet oranges peeled and sliced (seeds and as much of the 
core as poesible taken out), one pine-apple peeled and sliced (the 
canned is equally good), and one large cocoaruut grated; alter> 
nate the layers of orange and pine-apple with grated cocoa-nut, and 
sprinkle pulverized sugar over each layer. Or, use six oranges, six 
lemons, ajod two cocoa-nuts, or only oranges and cocoa-nuts, pre- 
pared as above. Other fruit salads can be similarly made. 

Apple Compote. 
Pare the apples, cut the core out, leaving them whole. Make a 
syrup, allowing three-fourths pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; 
when it comes to a boil put in the firuit and let cook until clear but 
remains whole. Remove the fruit to a glass bowl, and dissolve one- 
third of a box of gelatine in a half tea-cup of hot water, and stir 
briskly into the syrup, first taking off the fire. Then strain it over 
the apples, and set in a cool place to cool. When cold heap whipped 
cream over it. Some add sliced lemons to the syrup, and serve 
with a slice of the lemon on each apple. — Mrs, A. H, Bhea, NoA'

Apple Sauce. 

Pare, core and cut in quarters apples that do not cut to pieces 

easily, and put on to stew in cold water with plenty of sugar. 

Cover close and stew an hour or more. The addition of the sugar 

at first preserves the pieces whole. If they are preferred finely 

mashed, add sugar after they are done. 

Baked Apples. 

Cut out the blossoms and stems of tart appies, in the stem end 

fxit some sugar ; bake till soft ; serve either warm or cold. Sweet 

apples require a longer time for baking than sour, and are better 

for adding a little water in pan when placed to bake. They require 

several hours, and when done are of a rich, dark brown color. If 

taken out too soon they are insipid. For an extra nice dish, pare 

and core tart apples, place in pan, put butter and sugar in cavity,

and sprinkle cinnamon over them, and serve warm with cream or 
milk. Or, pare and quarter tart apples, put a layer in earthen bak- 
ing-dish, add lumps of butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon, then a 
layer of apples, etc., till dish is full; bake till soft. Or, quarter 
and core sour apples without paring, put in baking-dish, sprinkle 
with sugar and bits of butter, add a little water, and bake until 
tender. The proportion of sugar is a gill, and butter half-size of 
i^n egg, to three pints of apples, and a gill and a half of water. 

Ig£d Apples. 
Pare and core one dozen large apples, fill with sugar and a little 
butter and nutmeg; bake until nearly done, let cool, and remove to 
another plate, if it can be done without breaking them (if not, pouf 
ofT the juice). Ice tops and sides with caking-ice, and brown ligkUy; 
serve with cream. — Mrs. R. C. Canon, Harrisburg. 

Fried Apples. 
Quarter and core apples without paring; prepare firying-pan by 
heating it and putting in beef-drippings, lay the apples in the pan, 
skin side down, sprinkle with a little brown sugar, and when nearly 
done, turn and brown thoroughly. Or, cut in slices across the core, 
and fry like pancakes, turnmg when brown; serve with granulated 
sugar sprinkled over them. 

Black Caps. 
Pare and core tart apples with apple-corer, fill the center with 
sugar, stick four cloves in the top of each, and bake in deep pie- 
plates, with a littie water. 

Fried Bananas. 
Peel and slice lengthwise, fry in butter, sprinkle with sugar, and

must be ripe. 

Iced Currants. 

Wash and drain dry, large bunches of ripe currants, dip into 
beaten whites of eggs, put on sieve so they will not touch each 
other, sift powdered sugar thickly over them, and put in a warm 
place till dry. Cherries and grapes may be prepared in the same way.

Ohanqes in Jelly. 
Boil the smallestrsized oranges in water until a straw will easily 
penetrate them, clarify half a pound of sugar for each pound of 
fiiiit, cut in halves or quarters, and put them to the syrup, set over 
a slow fire until the fruit is clear; then stir into it an ounce or more 
of dissolved isinglass, and let it boil for a short time longer. Be- 
Fore taking it up try the jelly, and if it is not thick enough add 
more isinglass, first taking out the oranges into a deep glass dish, 
and then straining the jelly over them. Lemons may be prepared 

m the same manner. 

Orange Pyramid. 

Gut the peel in six or eight equal pieces, making the incisions 
from the stem downward ; peel each piece down about half way, 
and bend it sharply to the right, leaving the peeled orange appar- 
ently in a cup, from which it is removed without much difficulty. 
Pile the oranges so prepared in a pyramid on a high fruitrdish, and 
you have an elegant center-piece. 

Baked Pears. 
Bake washed, unpeeled pears in pan with only a tea-spoon or 
two of water ; sprinkle with the sugar, and serve with their own 

syrup. 

Baked Pie-plant. 

Cut in pieces about an inch long, put in baking-dish in layers 

with an equal weight of sugar, cover closely and bake. 

Baked Peaches. 
Wash peaches which are nearly or quite ripe, place in a deep 
dish, sprinkle with sugar, cover and bake until tender. 

Stewed Pie-plant. 
Make a rich syrup by adding sugar to water in which long strips 
of orange peel have been boiled until tender, lay into it a single 
layer of pieces of pie-plant three inches long, and stew gently until 
clear. When done remove and cook another layer. This makes a 
handsome dessert-dish, ornamented with puff-paste cut in fimcifu)

Peach Pyramid. 

Cut a dozen peaches in halves, peel and take out stones, crack 
half the seeds, and blanch the kernels ; make a clear boiling syrup 
of one pound of white sugar, and into it put the peaches and ker- 
nels ; boil very gently for ten minutes, take out half the peaches, 
boil the rest for ten minutes longer, and take out all the peaches 
and kernels ; mix with the syrup left in the kettle the strained juice 
of three lemons, and an oimce of isinglass dissolved in a little water

Frozen Peaches. 
Pare and divide large, fresh, ripe and juicy peaches, sprinkle 
over them granulated sugar, freeze them like ice-cream for an hour; 
remove them just before serving, and sprinkle with a little more 
sugar. Canned peaches and all kinds of berries may be prepared 
in the same way. — Mrs. A. O. Wilcox, 

To Keep Pine-apples. 
Pare and cut out the eyes of a ripe pine-apple, strip all the pulp 
from the core with a silver fork ; to a pint of this add a pound of 
granulated sugar, stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved, put in 
glass fruit-cans, and turn down the covers as closely as possible. 
This will keep a long time. 

Baked Quinces.

grated rind of one, and put in the pears ; cook them for a few min- 
utes in this syrup, then remove to the dish in which they are to bft

Mrater to cover it, and stir it into the hot syrup ; let boil up once 
and turn it over fruit through a strainer. The mold should be 
dipped in cold water before putting in firuit. When cold, turn 
jelly into a dish and serve with whipped cream around the base^ or 
pour sweet cream over it in saucers. 

Mock Strawberries. 
Cut ripe peaches and choice well-flavored apples, in proportion 
of three peaches to one apple, into quarters about the size of a 
strawberry, place in alternate layers, sprinkle the top thickly with 
sugar, and add pounded ice; let stand about two hours, mix 
peaches and apples thoroughly, let stand an hour longer, and serve.

Oranged Strawberries. 
Place a layer of strawberries in a deep dish ; cover the same 
thickly with pulverized sugar ; then a layer of berries, and so on, 
until all are used. Pour over them orange juice, in the proportion 
of three oranges to a quart of berries. Let stand for an hour, and 
just before serving sprinkle with pounded ice. Some use claret, 
grape or currant wine instead of orange juice. 

Strawberries with Whipped Cream. 
Prepare in layers as above, cover with one pint of cream, whitee 
of three eggs and a tea-cup of powdered sugar, whipped together 
and flavored with strawberry juice. 

Snow Flakes.

preserves, jeUies or jams. 

Peach Meringue. 
Put on to boil a quart of milk, omitting half a cup with which 
to moisten two table-spoons of com starch ; when the milk boils, 
add the moistened com starch ; stir constantly till thick, then re- 
move from the fire ; add one table-spoon butter, and allow the mix- 
ture to cool ; then beat in the yolks of three eggs till the mixture 
seems light and creamy ; add half a cup of powdered sugar. Cover 
the bottom of a well-buttered baking-dish with two or three layers

Raspberry Float. 

Crush a pint of very ripe red raspberries with a gill of sugar; 
beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth and add gradually a gill 
of powdered sugar ; press the raspberries through a fine strainer to 
avoid the seeds, and by degrees beat in the juice with the egg and 
sugar until so stiif fhat it stands in peaks. 

Flortoa Grape Fruit. 

The fruit stores display a new clear-skinned lemon-colored firuity 
about three times as large as an orange, and bearing a general 
resemblance to that fruit Its flavor is sub-acid, but its juicy pulp 
is inclosed in a tough white membrane of intensely bitter taste ; 
when this membrane is removed, the fruit is delicious. To prepare 
it for the table, cut the skin in sections and peel it off; separate the 
sections as you would those of an orange, and holding each one by 
the ends, break it open from the center, disclosing the pulp; tear 
this out of the bitter white membrane, which covers the sections^ 
carefnlly removing every part of it; k^ep the pulp as unbroken as 
possible, and put it into a deep dish with a plentiful sprinkling 
of fine sugar. Let it stand three or four hours, or over night, and 
tiieu use the fruit. It is refreshing and wholesome^ especially for 
a bilious temperament. 

Fig Sauce. 

Figs are very fine for dessert, stewed slowly until soft. Season with 
two ounces loaf-sugar to a pound of fruit; cook two hours; add a 
gla"53 port or other wine, also lemon-juice if liked. Can be seasoned 
witli a few bitter almonds or orange-peel. — A Georgia hovsekeeper. 



GAME. 



Of game birds the woodcock outranks all in delicate tendemeat 
«nd sweet flavor. The thigh is especially deemed a choice tidbit. 
The leg is the finest part of the ^ snipe, but generally the breast is 
the most juicy and nutritious part of birds. 

White-meated game should be cooked to well-done ; dark-meated 
game rare. The flesh of wild animals is harder and more solid, 
and has a less proportion of fat and juices to the lean, and is there- 
fore less easy of mastication when eaten within a day, and more 
nntritiouB, and the flavor more concentrated. Their decided flavor 
recommends them to invalids or others who are satiated with ordi- 
oary food. Keeping game renders it more tender, and brings out 
its flavor. When birds have become tainted, pick clean as soon as 
pOBBible and immerse in new milk for twenty-four hours, when they 
will be quite sweet and fit for cooking. 

Birds should be carefully dry-picked (removing all feathers that 
oome off easily), plunged in n pan of boiling water and skinned, 
drawn, wiped clean, and all shot removed, Grame should not be 
washed, unless absolutelv necessarv for cleanliness. With care in 
dressing, wiping will render them perfectly clean. If necessary to 
wash, do it quickly and use as little water as possible. The more 
plainly all kinds of game are cooked, the better they retain their 
fine flavor. They require a brisker fire than poultry, but take less 
time to cook. Their color, when done, should be a fine yellowish 
brown. Serve on toast. 

Broiling is a favorite method of cooking game, and all birds are 
exceedingly nice roasted. To broil, split down the back, open and 

(IffT) 



168 . OAMR 

flatten the breast by oovering with a doth and pounding, ^euson 
with pepper, and lay the inside first upon the gridiron ; turn as 
soon as browned, and when almost done take off, place on a pla^ 
ter, sprinkle with salt, and return to the gridiron.. When done, 
place in a hot dish, butter both sides well, and serve at once. The 
time required is usually about twenty minutes. 

To roast, season with salt and pepper, place a lump of butter 
inside, truss, skewer, and place in oven. The flavor is best pre* 
served without stuffing, but a plain bread-dressing, with a piece of 
salt pork or ham skewered on the breast, is very nice. A delicate 
way of dressing is to place an oyster dipped in the well-beaten yolk 
of an egg or in melted butter, and then rolled in bread crumbs, in- 
side each bird. Allow thirty minutes to roast or longer if stufl^ 
Wild ducks, pheasants and grouse are always best roasted. 

To lard game, cut fat salt pork into thin, narrow strips, thread a 
larding-needle with one of the strips, run the needle under the skin 
and a little of the flesh of the bird, and draw the pork half way 
through, so that the ends of the strips exposed will be of equal 
length. The strips should be about one inch apart The larding 
interferes with the natural flavor of the bird, hut renders it more 
juicy. Many prefer tying a piece of bacon on the breast instead. 

Pigeons should be cooked a long time, as they are usually quite 
lean and tough, and they are better to lie in salt water half an hour, 
or to be parboiled in it for a few minutes. They are nice roasted 
or made into a pie. 

If the " wild flavor" of the larger birds, such as pheasants, prairie 
chickens, etc., is disliked, they may be soaked over night in salt 
water, or two or three hours in soda and water, or parboiled with 
an onion or two in the water, and then cooked as desired. The 
:;c)arser kinds of game, such as geese, ducks, etc., may lie in salt 
water for several hours, or be parboiled in it with an onion inside 
each to absorb the rank flavor, and afterwards thoroughly rinsed 
in clear water, stuffed and roasted ; or pare a fresh lemon without 
breaking the thin, white, inside skin, put inside the game for a day 
or two, renewing the lemon every twelve hours. This will absorb 
unpleasant flavors from almost all meat and game. Some lay slices 
of onion over game while cooking, and remove before serving. In 



GAME. 169 

p»!paring txh wild ducks for invalids, it is a good plau to remove 
the skioy and keep a day or two before cooking. Squirrels should 
be carefully bkinned and laid in salt water a short time before cook* 
mg; if old, parboil. They are delicious broiled, and are excellent 
cooked in any way with thin slices of bacon. Venison, as in the 
days of good old Isaac, is still justly considered a " savoury dish.* 
The haunch, neck, shoulder and saddle should be roasted ; roast or 
broil the breast, and fry or broil the steaks with slices of salt pork. 
Venison requires more time for cooking than beefsteak. The hams 
are excellent pickled, smoked and dried, but they will not keep so 
k>ng as other smoked meats. 

The garnishes for game are fresh or preserved barberries, currant 
jelly, sliced oranges, and apple sauce. 



Broiled Pheasant or Prairie Chicken. 
Scald and skin, cut oif the breast and cut the re»t up in joints, 
being careful to remove all shot ; put in hot water all except the 
breast (which will be tender enough without parboiling), and boil 
UQtil it can be pierced with fork, take out, rub over salt, pepper, 
and butter, and broil with breast over brisk fire ; place a lump of 
batter on each piece, and set ail in the oven a few minutes. For 

breakfast, serve on fried mush ; for dinner on toast with a bit 
of current jelly over each piece. It may be served with toast 
cat in pieces about two niches square, over which pour gravy made 
by thickening the liquor in which the birds were boiled, with a 
litde butter and flour rubbed together and stirred in while boiling. 
Squirrels may be prepared the same way. — Mrs. W, W. Woods. 

Broiled Quail. 
Split through the back and broil over a hot fire, basting fre- 
quently with butter. When done place a bit of butter on each piece, 
and set in oven a ffew moments to brown. Serve on pieces of toast 
with currant jelly. Plovers are cooked in the same way. Pigeons 
thould be first parboiled and then broiled.

little chopped parsley, nutmeg, mace, cloves, and grated lemon-peel. 
Put a layer of the p^'eces with the seasoning into a wide-mouthed 
jug or a jar, then a layer of bacon sliced very thin, and so on till 
all is used ; add a scant half pint of water, cover the jug close and 
put in cold water, let boil three or four hours, according to the age 
of the hare; take the jug out of kettle, pick out the unmelted 
bacon and make a gravy of a little butter and flour with a little 
catsup. A tea-spoon of lemon-peel will heighten the flavor. — Mrs. 
Louise M. Lincoln. 

Quail on Toast. 

Dry-pick them, singe them with paper, cut off heads, and legs at 
first joint, draw, split down the back, soak in salt and water for 
five or ten minutes, drain and dry with a doth, lard them with 
bacon or butter, and rub salt over them, place on broiler and turn 
often, dipping two or three times into melted butter ; broil about 
twenty minutes. Have ready as many slices of buttered toast as 
there are birds, and serve a bird, breast upward, on each slice. 
Cook squabs or any small, tender bird by this recipe. 

Pabtridoe Pie. 

Parboil six partridges; line a deep dish or baking-pan with a 
rich biscuit crust, put in partridges, one dozen oysters, one table- 
spoon of butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste, fill up with 
water in which birds were parboiled, cover with paste, and bake 
half an hour. — Mrs. Hal Johnson, JacksonviUe, Fla, 

Boasted Pabtbidges. 

Clean and truss birds, put on spit or in oven to roast; baste with 
a little butter and hot water until a gravy is made, then baste with 
this ; use one tearspoon of butter to each bird. They must not be 
stuffed, as that destroys flavor. Boast thirty minutes. ' There is a 
good deal of conAision regarding the name of these delicious game 
birds, the quail being called a partridge in many localities. The part- 
ridge (ru£^ grouse) is a much larger bird than the quail, much 
shyer, and not often found in large coveys. Both are very delicious 
and always bring high prices in the markets. — Mrs, Mogor Maaon^

BoABT Haunch op Venison. 

Wash in warm water and dry well with a cloth, butter a sheet of 
white paper and put over the fat, lay in a deep baking-dish with 
a very little boiling water, cover with a close-fitting lid or with a 
coarse paste one-half inch thick. If the latter is used, a thickness or 
two of coarse paper should be laid over the paste. Cook in a mod- 
erately hot oven for from three to four hours, according to the size 
of the haunch, and about twenty minutes before nt is done quicken 
the fire, remove the paste and paper or dish-cover, dredge the joint 
with flour and baste well with butter until it is nicely fi*othed and of 
a dolicate brown color ; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white 
paper, and serve with a gravy made from its own dripping, having 
first removed the h.t Have the dishes on which the venison is 
served and the plates very hot Always serve with currant jelly. 

Roast Goose. 

The goose should not be more than eight months old, and the 
&tter the more tender and juicy the meat. A '* green" goose (four 
months old) is the choicest. Kill at least twenty-four hours before 
eooking ; cut the neck close to the back, beat the breast-bone flat 
with a rolling-pin, tie the wings and legs securely, and stuff* with the 
following mixture : three pints bread crumbs, six ounces butter or 
part butter and part salt pork, two choppea onions, one tea-spoon 
each of sage, black pepper and salt. Do not stuff very full, and 
stitch openings firmly together to keep flavor in and fat out If the 
goose is not fat, lard it with salt pork, or tie a slice on the breast 
Place in a baking-pan with a little water, and baste frequently with 
salt and water (some add onion and some vinegar), turning often so 
that the sides and back may all be nicely browned. When nearly 
done baste with butter and a little flour. Bake two hours, or more 
if old ; when done take from the pan, pour off the fet, and to the 
brown gravy left add the chopped giblets which have previously 
been stewed till tender, together with the water they were boiled in ; 
thicken with a little flour and butter rubbed together, bring to a 
boil, and serve with currant jelly. Apple sauce and onion sauce 
are prope? accompaniments to roast goose. — Mrs, J. jET. Shearer.

Roast Duck. 

Ducks are dressed and stuffed in the same manner as above. 
Young ducks should roast ftom twenty-five to thirty minutes ; ftdl- 
grown for an hour or more with frequent basting. Some prefer 
tiiem underdone, served very hot, but thorough cookmg will prove 
more generally palatable. Serve with currant jelly, apple sauce, 
and green pease. If old, parboil before roasting. 

Place the remains of a cold roast duck in a stew-pan with a pint 
of gravy and a little sage, cover closely, and let it simmer for half 
an hour ; add a pint of boiled green pease, stew a few minutes, 
remove to a dish, and pour over it the gravy and pease. 

Boiled Duck. 
Dress and rub well inside with salt and pepper, truss and tie in 
shape, drawing the legs in to the body, in which put one or two sage 
leaves, a little finely-chopped onion, and a little jellied stock or 
gravy; rub over with salt and pepper; make a paste in the propor- 
tion of one-half pound butter to one pound flour, in which inclose 
the duck, tie a cloth around all, and boil two hours or until quite 
tender, keeping it well covered with boiling water. Serve by pour- 
ing round it brown gravy made as follows : Put a lump of butter 
of the si2^ of an egg in a sauce-pan with a little minced onion; cook 
until slightly brown, then adding a small table-spoon of flour, stir 
well, and when quite brown add a half pint stock or water ; let 
cook a few minutes, strain, and add to the chopped giblets, previ- 
ously stewed till tender. — Mn, L, S. WUUston. 

Reed Bibds. 

Boasting by suspending on the little wire which accompanies the 
roaster, is the best method ; turn and baste firequently, or wash and 
peel with as thin a paring as possible large potatoes of equal size, 
cut a deep slice off one end of each, and scoop out a part of the po- 
tato ; drop a piece of butter into each bird, pepper and salt, and put 
it in the hollows made in the potatoes; put on as covers the pieces 
cut off, and clip the other end for them to stand on. Set in a bak- 
ing pan upright, with a Utile water to prevent burning, bake slowly, 
and serve in the dish in which they were baked. 

Or, boil in a crust like dumplings.

Rabbits. 
Rabbits, which are in the beet condition in midwinter, may be 
fricaaseed like chicken in white or brown sauce. To make a pie, first 
stew till tender, and make like chicken-pie. To roast, stuff with a 
dressing made of bread-crumbs, chopped salt pork, thyme, onion, 
and pepper and salt, sew up, rub over with a little butter, or pin on 
it a few slices of salt pork, add a little water in the pan, and baste 
often. Serve with mashed potatoes and currant jelly. 

Snipe. 
Snipe are best roasted with a piece of pork tied to the breast, or 

they may be stuffed and baked. — Mrs, if. R. 

SAiiMi OF Duck. 
Save remnants of cold duck or other game, trim meat off neatly, 

set aside; place all the remains (bones, gravy, etc.) in a sauce-pan 

and. cover with cold-water; bring gently to a boil ; skim, add an 

onion that has been cut up and fried brown (nU burned) ; simmer 

gently for about an hour, then set the sauce-pan in a cool place 

long enough to allow the fat to rise and "settle on top;" skim this 

off carefldly — it will be nice to fry potatoes with. Now return the 

aauce-pan to the fire, and when about to boil strain off the liquid ; 

set on again, add salt and skim. If the liquid looks cloudy, let it 

boil up, throw in a little cold water, and the scum will rise. Now 

put in the pepper and such spice as may be desired, also a bunch 

of herbs tied up in a piece of muslin, or very finely powdered. 

Take a large spoon of flour that h&s been baked in the oven and 

kept for gravy, mix it well with a lump of butter same size, put 

this and the meat all in together and stir well until it is just ready 

to boil again, but see that it does not boil; cover closely and set back 

where it may keep very hot without cooking. The safest plan is to 

put the sauce-pan in a vessel of hot water for ten or fifteen minutes. 

Fried Woodcock. 
Dress, wipe clean, tie the legs, skin the head and neck, turn the 

beak under the wing and tie it ; tie a piece of bacon over it, and im- 
merse m hot &t for two or three minutes. Serve on toast. 

Another fiivorite way is to split them through the back and 
broil, basting with butter, and serving on toast. They may also be 
roasted whole before the fire for fifteen or twenty minutes. 



ICES AND ICE-CREAM. 



Perfectly fresh sweet cream makes the most delicious ice-cream« 
A substitute is a preparation of boiled new milk, etc., made late in 
the evening if for dinner, in the morning if for tea, and placed on ice. 
One mixture is a custard made as follows : Take two quarts new milk, 
put on three pints to boil in a custard-kettle, or a pail set within a 
kettle of boiling water, beat yolks and whites of eight eggs sepa- 
rately, mix the yolks with the remaining pint and stir dofujiy into the 
boiling milk, boil two minutes, remove from the stove, immodiaidg 
add one and a half pounds sugar, let it dissolve, strain while hd 
through a crash towel, cool, add one quart rich cream and two table* 
spoons vanilla (or season to taste, remembering that the strength of 
the flavoring and also the sweetness is very much diminished by 
the freezing). Set the custard and also the whites (not beaten) in a 
30ol place until needed, and about three hours before serving begin 
the preparations for freezing. Put the ice in a coarse coflee-sack, 
pound with an ax or mallet until the lumps are no larger than a 
small hickory-nut ; see that the freezer is properly set in the tub, 
the beater in and the cover secure ; place around it a layer of ice 
about three inches thick, then a layer of coarse salt — rock salt is 
best — then ice again, then salt, and so on until packed full, with a 
layer of ice last. The proportion should be about three-fourths ice 
and one-fourth salt. Pack very solid, pounding with a broom-handle 
or stick, then remove the cover and pour the custard to which you 
have just added the well-whipped whites into the freezer, filling two- 
thirds full to give room for expansion ; replace the cover and begin 
turning the freezer; after ten minutes pack the ice down again, 
drain off most of the water, add more ice and turn again, repeat*

fng this operation several times until the cream is well frozen, and 
you can no longer turn the beater. (The above quantity ought to 
freeze in half an hour,' but the more pure cream used the longer it 
takes to freeze.) Brush the ice and salt from and remove the 
cover, take out the beater, scrape the cream down from the- sides 
of freezer, beat well several minutes with a wooden paddle, replace 
the cover, fill the hole with a cork, pour off all the water, pack 
again with ice (using salt at the bottom, but none at the top of tub), 
heap the ice on the cover, spread over it a piece of carpet or a thick 
woolen blanket, and set away in a cool place untO needed ; or, if 
molds are used, fill them when you remove the beater, packing the 
cream in very tightly, and place in ice and salt for two hours. To 
remove the cream, dip the molds for an instant in warm water. 
When cream is used in making ice-cream, it is better to whip a part 
of it, and add just as the cream is beginning to set. 

Coffee ice-cream should be thickened with arrowroot; the flavor- 
ing for almond cream should be prepared by pounding the kernels 
to a paste with rose-water, using arrowroot for thickening. For 
cocoa-nut cream, grate cocoarnut and add to the cream and sugar 
just before freezing. The milk should never be heated for pine- 
apple, strawberry, or raspberry cream. Berry flavors are made best 
by allowing whole berries to stand for awhile well sprinkled with 
sugar, mashing, straining the juice, adding sugar to it, and stirring 
it into the cream. For a quart of cream, allow a quart of fruit and 
a pound of sugar. In addition to this, add whipped cream and 
sweetened whole berries, just as the cream is beginning to set, in 
the proportion of a cup of berries and a pint of whipped cream to 
three pints of the frozen mixture. Canned berries may be used in 
the same way. A pint of berries or peaches, cut fine, added to a 
quart of ordinary ice^^ream, while in process of freezing, makes a 
delicious fruit ice-cream. 

Freeze ice-cream in a warm place (the more rapid the melting of 
the ice the quicker the cream freezes), always being careful that no 
salt or water gets within the freezer. K cream begins to melt 
while serving, beat up well from the bottom ^Ith a long wooden 
paddle. Water-ices are made from the juices of fruits, mixed with 
water, sweetened, and frx)zen like cream. In making them, if they

are not well mixed before freezing, the sugar will sink to the bot* 
torn, and the mixture will have a sharp, unpleasant taste. It is a 
better plan to make a syrup of the sugar and water, by boiling 
and skimming when necessary, and, when cold, add the juice of the 
fruit.' 

The following directions for making " self-freeziug ice cream** are 
from ** Common Sense in the Household." After preparing the 
freezer as above, but leaving out the beater, remove the lid care- 
fully, and with a long wooden ladle or flat stick beat the custard as 
you would batter steadily lor five or six minutes. Replace the lid, 
pack two inches of pounded ice over it ; spread above all several 
folds of blanket or carpet, and leave it untouched for an hour ; at 
the end of that time remove the ice from above the freezer-lid, wipe 
off carefully and o|)en the freezer. Its sides will be lined with a 
thick layer of frozen cream. Displace this with the ladle or a long 
knife, working every part of it loose ; beat up the custard again 
firmly and vigorously for fifteen or twenty minutes, until it is all 
smooth, half-congealed paste. The perfection of the ice-cream de- 
pends upon the thoroughness of the beating at this point. Put on 
the cover again, pack in more ice and salt, turn off the brine, cover 
the freezer entirely with the ice, and spread over all the carpet. 
At the end of two or three hours more, again turn off the brine and 
add fresh ice and salt, but do not open the freezer for two hours 
more. At thai; time take the freezer from the ice, open it, wrap a 
towel wet in hot water about the lower part, and turn out a solid 
column of ice-cream, close grained, firm, delicious. Any of the 
recipes for custard ice-cream may be frozen in this way. 

Ice-creams may be formed into fanciful shapes by the use of 
molds. After the cream is frozen, place in mold, and set in 
pounded ice and salt until ready to serve. Cream may be frozen 
without a patent freezer, by simply placing it in a covered tin pail, 
and setting the latter in an ordinary wooden bucket, and proceed 
exactly as directed for self-freezing ice-cream,, packing into the space 
between them, very firmly, a mixture of one part salt to two parts 
of snow or pounded ice. When the space is full to within an inch 
of the top, remove cover.

Chocolate Ice-Creah. 

Scald one pint new milk, add by degrees three-quarters of a 
pound sugar, two eggs, and five table-spoons chocolate, rub smooth 
in a little milk. Beat well for a moment or two, place over the 
fire and heat until it thickens well, stirring constantly, set off, add 
ft tablespoon of thin, dissolved gelatine, and when cold, place in 
freezer ; when it begins to set, add a quart of rich cream, half of it 
well whipped. 

To make a mold of chocolate and vanilla, freeze in separate 
freezei*s, divide a mold through the center with card-board, fill each 
division with a difierent cream, and set mold in ice and salt for an 
hour or moi'c. 

To make chocolate fruit ice-cream, when almost frozen, add a 

coffee-cup of preserved peaches, or any other preserves, cut in fine 

XHeces. 

Egoless Ice-cream. 

A scant tea-cup flour to two quarts new milk ; put three pints on 
to boil (in tin pail set in a kettle of boiling water), mix the flour 
with the other pint tiU smooth, then stir it in the boiling milk ; let 
it boil ten or fifteen minutes, and, just before taking it from the fire, 
stir in one and a half pounds pulverized sugar (any good white 
sugar will do). Care must be taken to stir all the time after put- 
ting in the sugar, only letting it remain a moment, or just long 
enough to dissolve it ; take from stove, and strain at once through 
a crash toweL When cold, add one quart cream. Flavor with 
vanilla, in the proportion of one and a fourth table-spoons to a gallon.

Fruit Frapees. 

Line a mold with vanilla ice-weani, fill the center with fresh 
berries, or fruit cut in slices, cover with ice cream, cover closely, 
and set in freezer for half an hour, with salt and ice well packed 
around it. The fruit' must be chilled, but not frozen. Strawber-

One quart new milk, two eggs, two table-spoons com starch; 
heat the milk in a dish set in hot water, then stir in the com starch 
mixed smooth in a little of the milk ; let it boil for one or two 
minutes, then remove from stove and cool, and stir in the egg and 
a half pound sugar. If to be extra nice, add a pint of rich cream, 
and one-fourth pound sugar, strain the mixture, and when cool add 
the flavoring, and freeze as follows: Prepare freezer in the usual 
manner, turn the crank one hundred times, then pour upon the 
ice and salt a quart boiling water from the tea-kettle. Fill up 
again with ice and salt, tum the crank fifty times one way and 
twenty-five the other (which serves to scrape the cream from sides 
of freezer) ; by this time it will turn very hard, indicating that the 
cream is frozen sufficiently. — Mrs. Win, Herricky 

Lemon ics- cream. 
Squeeze a dozen lemons, make the juice quite thick with white 
sugar, stir into it very slowly, three quarts of creanii, and freeze. 
Orange ice-cream is prepared in the same way, using less sugar. 

Pike-apple Ice-cream. 
Three pints cream, two large ripe pine-apples, two pounds pow- 
dered sugar ; slice the pine-apples thin, scatter the sugar between 
the slices, cover and let the fruit stand three hours, cut or chop it 
up in the syrup; and strain through a hair-sieve or double bag of 
coarse lace; beat gradually into the cream, and freeze as rapidly as 
possible ; reserve a few pieces of pine-apple unsugared, cut into 
square bits, and stir through cream when half frozen, first a pint of 
well-whipped cream, and then the fruit. Peach ice-cream may be 
made in the same way. — Mr^, L. M. T., 

Strawberry Ice-cream. 

Sprinkle strawberries with sugar, wash well and rub through a

Washington Fruit Ice-cream. 

Take two dozen sweet and half a dozen bitter almonds; blanch 
in scalding water, throw into a bowl of cold water; pound one at 
a time in a mortar, till they become a smooth paste firee from the 
smallest lumps; add frequently a few drops of rose-water or lemon- 
juice to make them light and prevent ''oiling." Seed and cut a 
quarter pound of the best bloom raisins ; mix with them a quarter 
pound of Zante currants, picked, washed and dried, and three 
ounces of chopped citron ; dredge well with flour. Take a half 
pint of very rich milk, split a vanilla bean, cut it into pieces two 
or three inches long, and boildl' iji the milk till the flavor of the 
vanilla is well extracted, then ^ain it out and mix the vanilla 
milk with a pint of rich cream, and stir in gradually a half pound 
of powdered loaf-sugar and a nutmeg grated. Then add the 
pounded almonds, and a large wine-glass of either marasquino, 
noyau, curacoa or the very best brandy. Beat in a shallow pan 
the yolks of eight eggs till very light, thick and smooth, and stir 
them gradually into the mixture. Simmer over the flre (stirring all 
the time), but take ofi* just before it boils, otherwise it vrill curdle. 
At once stir in the fruit, set to cool, and then add a large tea-cup 
preserved strawberries or raspberries, half a dozen preserved apricots 
or peaches, half a dozen preserved green limes, and any other very 
nice and delicate sweetmeats; add a pint whipped cream lightly to 
the mixture; put the whole into a large melon-mold that opens in 
the middle, and freeze four hours in the usual way. Turn out when 
wanted and serve on a glass dish. — Mn. Chv. Oravery Oregon. 



JELLIES AND JAMS. 



Jellies were formerly reputed nourishing, digestible, and fit food 
for sick and delicate persons, but modern investigation places them 
second to the lean part of animals and birds. When made of gela- 
tine, they have no nutrition, and are simply used to carry a pala- 
table flavor. 

Always make jellies in a porcelain kettle, if possible, but brass 
may be used if scoured very bright and the fruit is removed imme- 
diately on taking from the fire. Use the best refined or granulated 
sugar, and do not have the fruit, especially currants and grapes, 
overripe. 

To extract the juice, place fruit in kettle with just enough water 
to keep from burning, stir often, and let remain on the fire until 
thoroughly scalded ; or a better but rather slower method is to place 
it in a stone jar set within a kettle of tepid water, boil until the 
fiiut is well softened, stirring frequently, and then strain a small 
quantity at a time through a strong coarse flannel or cotton bag 
wrung out of hot water, after which let it drain, and squeeze it with 
the hands as it cools, emptying the bag and rinsing it off* each time 
it is used. The larger fruits, such as apples and quinces, should be 
cut in pieces, cores removed if at all defective, water added to just 
cover them, boiled gently until tender, turned into bag and placed 
to drain for three or four hours, or over night. Make not over two 
or three pints of jelly at a time, as larger quantities require longer 
boiling. As a general rule allow equal measures juice and sugar. 
Boil juice* rapidly ten minutes from the first moment of boiling, 
skim, add sugar, and boil ten minutes longer; or spread the sugar 

(181) 



182 JELLIES AND JAMS. 

in a large dripping-pan, set in the oven, stir often to prevent burn- 
ing, boil the juice just twenty minutes, add the hot sugar, let boil 
up once, and pour into the jelly-glasses immediately, as a thin skin 
forms over the surface which keeps out the air ; cover with brandied 
tissue paper, cut to fit glass closely, cool quickly and set in a dry, 
cool, dark place. Jelly should be examined toward the end of sum- 
mer, and if there are any signs of fermentation, reboiL Jelly needs 
more attention in damp, rainy seasons than in others. To test jelly, 
drop a little in a glass of very cold water, and if it immediately' 
falls to the bottom it is done ; or drop in a saucer, and set on ice or 
in a cool place; if it does not spread, but remains rounded, it is 
finished. Some strain through the bag into the glasses, but this 
involves waste, and if skimming is carefully done is not necessary. 
A little butter or lard, rubbed with a cloth on the outside of glasses 
or cans, will enable one to pour in the boiling fruit or liquid, the 
first spoon or two slowly, without breaking the glass. If jelly is 
not very firm, let it stand in the sun covered with bits of window^ 
glass or pieces of mosquito netting, for a few days. Never attempt 
to make jelly in damp or cloudy weather if firmness and clearness 
are desired. Use a wooden or silver spoon to stir, dip with earthen 
cup, and cook in porcelain -lined kettles. Currants and berries 
should 1)6 made up as soon as picked ; never let them stand over 
night. When ready to put away, cover with pieces of tissue or 
writing-paper cut to fit and pressed closely upon the jelly, and put 
on the lid or cover with thick paper, brushed over on the inside 
with the white of an egg and turned down on the outside of glass. 



Apple or Blackberry Jelly. 
Prepare nice, tart, juicy apples as in general directions, using three 
quarters of a pint of sugar to a pint of juice. Prepare blackberry 
jelly according to general directions for berries. 

Calf's- FOOT Jelly. 
Cut across the first joint, and through the hoof, place in a large 
sauce-pan, cover with cold water, and bring quickly to the boiling

leet> |mt Muc^-pan over fire, and when water boils, set aside to a 

cooler place, where it will simmer very slowly for five hours ; strain 

the liquor through a fine sieve, or a coarse towel, let it stand over 

night to set, remove the fat that has risen to the top, dip a towel in 

boiling water, and wash the surface, which wiU be quite firm. Now 

place in a porcelain-lined sauce-pan, and melt, add juice of two 

lemons, rinds of three cut into strips, one-fourth pound of cut loa^ 

sugar, ten cloves, and one inch of cinnamon stick. Put the whites 

of three eggs, together with the shells (which must first be blanched 

in boiling water), into a bowl, beat them slightly, and pour them 

into the sauce-pan, continuing to use the egg-beater until the whole 

boils, when the pan should be drawn aside where it will simmer 

gently for ten minutes, skimming ofi* all scum as it rises. While 

simmering, prepare a piece of flannel by pouring through it a little 

warm water; and when the jelly has simmered ten minutes, pour 

it through this bag into a bowl, and repeat the process of straining 

until it is perfectly clear, when add a half gill of sherry (or brandy, 

or brandy and sherry mixed in equal proportions)i stir well, pour 

into molds, and place upon ice or in a cool place until jelly sets and 

becomes firm enough to turn out and serve. 

Currant Jelly. 
Do not pick from the stem, but carefully remove all leaves and 
imperfect fruit, place in a stone jar, and follow general directions; 
or place one pint currants, picked off the stem, and one pint sugar, 
in the kettle on the stove, scald well, skim out currants, and dry 
on plates; or make into jam with one-third currants and two-thirds 
raspberries, straining juice after sweetening, and cooking until it 
"jellies.'*' After currants are dried put them in stone jars and 
cover closely. — Mn. A, B. M, \ 

Crakberry Jelly. 
Prepare juice as in general directions, add one pound sugar to 
every pint, boil and skim, test by dropping a little into cold water 
(when it does not mingle with the water it is done), rinse glasses 
in cold water before pouring in the jelly to prevent sticking. The 
pulp may be sweetened and used for sauce. — C O. & E. W.

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Wash and quarter large Siberian crabs, but do not core, ooyer 
to the depth of an inch or two witli cold water, and cook to a 
mush ; pour into a coarse cotton bag or strainer, and when cool 
enough, press or squeeze hard, to extract all the juice. Take a 
piece of fine Swito muslin or crinoline, wring out of water, spread 
over a colander placed over a crock, and with a cup dip the juice 
slowly in, allowing plenty of time to run through ; repeat this pro- 
cess twice, rinsing out the musliu frequently. Allow the strained 
juice of four lemons to a peck of apples, and three quarters of a 
pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil the juice from ten to 
twenty minutes; while boiling sift in the sugar slowly, stirring con- 
stantly, and boil five minutes longer. This is generally sufficient, 
but it is always safer to '* try it," and ascertain whether it will 
"jelly. " This makes a very clear, sparkling jelly. — Mrs, Oarol

Coffee Jelly. 

Half box Coxe's gelatine soaked half an hour in a half tea-cup 

cold water (as little water as possible), one quart strong coffee, 

made as if for the table and sweetened to taste ; add the dissolved 

^latine to the hot coffee, stir well, strain into a mold rinsed with 

cold water just before using, set on ice or in a very cool place, and 

serve with whipped cream. Thb jelly is very pretty, formed in a 

circular mold with tube in center ; when turned out fill the space 

in center with whipped cream heaped up a little. — Mrs. A. Wtlson^

Easter Jelly. 

Color calf s-foot jelly a bright yellow by steeping a small quantity 
of dried saffron leaves in the water. Pare lemons in long strips 
about the width of a straw, boil in water until tender, throw them 
into a rich syrup, and boil until clear. Make a blanc-mange of 
cream, color one-third pink with poke-berry syrup, one-third green 
with spinach, and leave the other white. Pour out egg?, from a hole 
a half inch in diameter in the large end, wash and drain the shells 
carefully, set them in a basin of salt to fill, and pour in the blanc- 
mange slowly through a funnel, and place the dish in a refrigerator 
for several hours. When ready to serve, select a round, shallow

scatter the strips of lemon peel over the edge like straws, remove 
the egg<6hells carefully from the blanc-mange, and fill the nest with 
them. — Mrs. C. M, Coates, PfiUadelphia. 

Four-Fruit Jelly. 

Take equal quantities of ripe strawberries, raspberries, currants, 

and reil cherries, all should be fully ripe, and the cherries must be 

stoned, taking care to preserve the juice that escapes in stoning, and 

add it to the rest. Mix the fruit together, put it into a linen 

bag, and squeeze it thoroughly ; when it has ceased to drip, measure 

the juice, and to every pint allow a pound and two ounces of the 

best loaf-sugar, in large lumps. Mix the juice and sugar together; 

put them in a porcelain-lined preserving kettle, and boil for half an 

hour, skimming frequently. Try the jelly by dipping out a spoon^' 

fid, and holding it in the open air ; if it congeals readily it is suffi* 

dently done. ThisjeUy u very fine, — Mr». E, S, MiUer. 

Grape Jelly. 
Prepare fruit and rub through a sieve; to every pound of pulp 
add a pound of sugar, stir well together, boil slowly twenty minutes, 
then follow general directions; or, prepare the juice, boil twenty 
minutes, and add one pound of sugar to one pound of juice after it 
is reduced by boiling ; then boil ten or fifteen minutes. Or put on 
grapes just beginning to turn, l)oil, place in jelly-bag and let drain; 
to one pint juice add one pint sugar, boil twenty minutes, and just 
before it is done add one tearspoon dissolyed gum-arabic. — Mrs. W. M. 

Lemon Jelly. 
Juice of six lemons, grated peel of two, two targe cups sugar, one 
package Coxe's gelatine soaked in two cups cold water, two glasses 
pale sherry or white wine, one pint boiling water ; stir lemon-juice, 
peel, sugacand soaked gelatine together, and cover for an hour; pour 
the boiling water over them ; stir until all is dissolved perfectly, add 
wine, strain through flannel, and pour in mold. If fruit jdelds less than 
a large co£fee-cup juice, add more water, so the jelly may not be tough. 

Orange Jelly. 
Two quarts water, four ounces gelatine, nine oranges and three 
lemons, a pound sugar, whites of three eggs; soak gelatine in a pint

of water, boil the three pints water and sugar together, skim well, 
add dissolved gelatine, orange and lemon juice, and beaten whites; 
let oome to a boil, skim off carefully all scum, boil until it jeUies^ 
and pour jelly into mold. Strain, scum and add to mold* 

Peach Jellt. 

Crack one-third of the kernels and put them in the jar with the 
peaches, which should be pared, stoned and sliced. Heat in a pot 
of boiling water, stirring occasionally until the fruit is well broken. 
Strain, and to every pint of peach juice add the juice of a lemon.- 
Measure again, and to every pint of peach juice add a pound of 
sugar. Heat the sugar very hot, and add when the juice has boiled 
twenty minutes. Let it come to a boil and take instantly from the 
fire. This is very fine for jelly cake. 

Quince Jellt. 

Rub the quinces with a cloth until perfectly smooth, cut in small 
pieces, pack tight in a kettle, pour on cold water until level with the 
fruit, boil until very soft ; make a three-cornered flannel bag, pour 
in fruit and hang up to drain, occasionally pressing on the top and 
sides to make the juice run more freely, taking care not to press hard 
enough to expel the pulp. There is not much need of pressing a 
bag made in this shape, as the weight of the fruit in the larger part 
causes the juice to flow freely at the point. To a pint of juice add 
Sk pint of sugar and boil fifteen minutes, or until it is jelly; pour 
into tumblers, or bowls, and finish according to general directions. 
If quinces are scarce, the parings and cores of quinces with good 
tart apples, boiled and strained as above, make exceUent jelly, and 
the quinces are saved for preserves. — Mrs. M. J. W. 

Transcendent Crab-apple Jelly. 

Transcendents or any variety of crab-apples, may be prepared as 
cultivated wild plums, adding flavoring of almond, lemon, peachy 
pine-apple or vanilla to the jelly in the proportion of one tea-spoon 
to two pinUi, or more if it is wished stronger, just before it is donOr 

Plum Jelly. 

If plums are wild (not cultivated) put in pan and sprinkle with 
soda and pour hot water over them, let stand a few moments and

cap ; then Btrain the rest through small salt-bags (by the way, keep 

them for jelly-bags as they are just the thing), do not squeeze them. 
Take pound for pound of juice and sugar, or pint for pint, and boil 
for eight or ten minutes. Jelly will be nicer if only one measure or 
a measure and a half is made at one time ; if more, boil longer ; 
some boil juice ten or fifteen minutes, then add sugar and boil five 
minutes longer. It can be tested by dropping in a saucer and 
placing on ice or in a cool place ; if it does not spread but remains 
rounded it is finished. If the plums are the cultivated wild 
plum, make as above without using the soda. Take the plums 
that are left and press through a sieve, then take pint for pint of 
sugar and pulp, boiling the latter half an hour and then adding 
sugar, boiling ten or fifteen minutes more. Half a pint sugar to a 
pint, makes a rich marmalade, and one-third pint to pint, boiling it 
longer, is nice canned, and used for pies, adding milk, eggs and 
sugar as for squash pies. 

Plum-apple jelly may be made by preparing the juice of apples 
and plums as above (a nice proportion is one part plums to two 
parts apples ; for instance, one peck of plums to two pecks apples) ; 
then mixing the juice and finish without flavoring. The marma- 
lade is made in the same way as above. Some add a little ginger 
root to it. One bushel of apples and one peck of plums make forty 
pints of jelly, part crab-apple and part mixed, and sixteen quart 
glass cans of mixed marmalade. In making either kind of jelly the 
fruit may be squeezed and the juice strained twice through swiss 
or crinoline and made into jelly. The pulp can not then be used 
for marmalade. 

Pie-plant Jelly. 
Wash the stalks well, cut into pieces an inch long, put them into 
a preserving-kettle with enough water to cover them, and boil to a 
soft pulp; strain through a jelly-bag. To each pint of this juice 
add a poand of loaf-sugar; boil again, skimming often, and when 
it jellies on the skimmer remove it from the fire and put into jars.

JAMS. 



In making jams, the fruit should be carefully cleaned and thar- 
(mghly bruised, as mashing it before cooking prevents it fix>m becom- 
ing hard. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes before adding the sugar, 
lis the flavor of the fruit is thus better preserved (usually allowing 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit), and then 
boil half an hour longer. Jams require almost constant stirring, 
and every house-keeper should be provided with a small paddle with 
handle at right angles with the blade (similar to an apple-butter 
** stirrer," only smaller), to be used in making jams and marmalades. 
Jams are made from the more juicy berries, such as blackberries, 
currants, raspberries, strawberries, etc.; m^irmalades from the firmei 
fruits, such as pine-apples, peaches and apricots. Both require th% 
closest attention, as the slightest degree of burning ruins the flavor. 
They must be boiled sufficiently, and have plenty of sugar to keep 
well. 

To tell when any jam or marmalade is sufficiently cooked, take 
out some of it on a plate and let it cool. If no juice or moisture 
gathers about it, and it looks dry and glistening, it is done thor- 
oughly. Put up in glass or small stone jars, and seal or secure like 
canned fruits or jellies. Keep jellies and jams in a cool, dry, and 
dark place. 

Currant Jam. 

Pick from stems and wash thoroughly with the hands, put into a 
preserving kettle and boil fifteen or twenty minutes, stirring often, 
and skimming ofi* any scum that may arise ; then add sugar in the 
proportion of three-fourths pound sugar to one pound fruit, or, by 
measure, one coflfee-cup of sugar to one pint mashed fruit ; boil thirty 
minutes longer, stirring almost constantly. When done, pour in 
small jars or glasses, and either seal or secure like jelly, by first 
pressing paper, cut to fit the glasses, down close on the fruit, and 
then larger papers, brushed on the inside with white of eggs, with 
the edges turned down over the outside of the glass.

Gooseberry Jam. 

Stew the berries in a little water, press through a coarse sieve, 
retnm to the kettle, add three-fourths pound sugar to each pound 
of the pulped gooseberry ; boil three-quarters of an hour, stirring 
constantly ; pour in jars or bowls, and cover as directed for cur- 
rant jams. — Mrs. C. Meade, Tenn. 

Grape or Plum Jam. 

Stew in a little water, and press the fruit through a colander or 
coarse sieve, adding a little water to plums to get all the pulp 
through ; add sugar, and finish as in other jams. 

Raspberry Jam. 

Make by itself, or, better, combined with currants in the propor- 
tion of one-third currants to two-thirds raspberries ; mash the fruit 
well, and proceed as in currant jam. 

Make blackberry jam like raspberry, except that it should not be 
mixed with currants. 

Strawberry jam is made exactly like blackberry. 

French Jam. 

The addition of one pound of raisins to each gallon of currant 
jam converts this into very fine French jam. — Mrs. 8. C. , Parity Ky. 

Fruit Jelly. 

Take one box of gelatine, soak it one hour in a pint of cold water ; 
when well soaked pour on a pint of boiling water ; then put in a 
quart of any kind of fruit, strawberries, raspberries or cherries be- 
ing nice; add half cup sugar, one spoonful of extract of lemon; 
pour into a mold, find when cold eat with cream and sugar or 
whipped cream. It is delicious. — Ms8 L. A. C, Ky. 

Wine Jelly. 

One ounce Coxe's gelatine, one pound loaf sugar ; dissolve gela- 
tine in a pint boiling water, add sugar and a quart of white wine ; 
stir mixture very hard and pour in mold ; when congealed, wrap 
mold in a cloth dipped in warm water, turn out jelly and eat with 
cream. — Mn, 8. P. H,^ On, 



MEATS. 



InatteDtion to the temperature of the water and too early ap- 
plication of salt cause great waste in boiling meats. To make fresh 
meat rich and nutritious it should be placed in a kettle of bailing 
water (pure soft water is best), skimmed well as soon as it begins to 
boil again, and placed where it will slowly but constantly boil. The 
meat should be occasionally turned and kept well under the water, 
and iresh hot water supplied as it evaporates in boiling. Plunging 
in hot water hardens the fibrine on the outside, encasing and re- 
taining the rich juices — and the whole theory of correct cooking, in 
a nut-shell, is to retain as much as possible of the nutriment of food. 
No salt should be added until the meat is nearly done, as it extracts 
the juices of the meat if added too soon. Boil gently, as rapid 
boiling hardens the fibrine and renders the meat hard, tasteless, 
and scarcely more nutritious than leather, without really hafitening 
the process of cooking, every degree of heat beyond the boiling 
point being worse than wasted. There is a pithy saying: "The 
pot should only smile, not laugh." The bubbles should appear in 
one part of the surface of the water only, not all over it Thife 
differs from "simmering," as in the latter there is merely a sizzling 
on the side of the pan. Salt meat should be put on in cold water 
80 that it may freshen in cooking. Allow twenty minutes to the 
pound for fresh, and thirty-five for salt meats, the time to be modi- 
fied, of course, by the quality of the meat. A pod of red pepper 
in the water will prevent the unpleasant odor of boiling from filliixg 

the house.

proper is almost unknown in these days of stoves and 
ranges — baking, a much inferior process, having taken its place. In 
roasting the joint is placed close to a brisk fire, turned so as to ex- 
pose ereiy part to the heat, and then moved back to finish in a 
more moderate heat The roast should be basted frequently with 
the drippings, and, when half cooked, with salt and water. 

To roast in oven, the preparations are very simple. The fire 
must be bright and the oven hot. The roast will need no washing 
if it comes from a cleanly butcher ; wiping with a towel dampened 
in cold, water is all that is needed ; if washing is necessary, dash 
over quickly with cold water and wipe dry. If meat has been kept 
a little too long, wash in vinegar, wipe dry, and dust with a very 
Utde floor to absorb the moisture. Place in pan, on a tripod, or two 
or three clean bits of wood laid cross- wise of pan, to keep it out of 
the &t If meat is very lean, add a table-spoon or two of water ; 
if fat, the juices of the meat will be sufiScient, and the addition of 
the water renders it juiceless and tasteless. While the meat is in 
the oven, keep the fire hot and bright, baste several times, and when 
about half done turn it, always keeping the thick part of the meat 
in the hottest, part of the oven. Take care that every part of the 
roast, including the fat of the tenderloin, is cooked so that the text- 
ure is chang^. 

If the fire has been properly made, and the roast is not large, it 
should not require replenishing, but, if necessary, add a little ^ei 
at a time, so as not to check the fire, instead of waiting until a 
great deal must be added to keep up the bright heat. Most 
persons like roast beef and mutton underdone, and less time is re- 
quired to cook them than for pork and veal or lamb, which must be 
very well done. Fifteen minutes to the pound and fifteen minutes 
longer is the rule for beef and mutton, and twenty minutes to 
the pound and twenty minutes longer for pork, veal and lamb. 
The directions for beef apply equally well to pork, veal, mutton 
and lamb. Underdone meat is cooked throughout,, so that the 
bright red juices follow the knife of the carver ; if it is a livid 
purple it is raw, and unfit for food. When done, the roast should 
be a rich brown, and the bottom of the pan covered with a thick 
ghize. Bemove the joint, sift evenly over with fine salt,iand it is 



192 MEATS. 

ready to serve. Never salt before or while cooking, as it draws 
out the juices. To prepare the gravy, pour off the fat gently, 
holding the pan steadily so as not to lose the gravy which underlies 
it; put pan on the stove, pour into it half a cup of boiling water 
(vary the quantity with the size of the roast ; soup of any kind b 
better than water if at hand), add a little salt, stir with a spoon 
until the particles adhering to the sides of the pan are removed and 
dissolved, making a rich, brown gravy (some mix flour and water, 
and add as thickening). 

In roasting all meats, success depends upon basting frequently 
(by dipping the gravy from the pan, over the meat with 'a large 
spoon), turning often so as to prevent burning, and carefully regu- 
lating the heat of the oven. Allow fifteen to twenty-five minutes 
to the pound in roasting, according as it is to be rare or well done, 
taking into consideration the quality of the meat. Eoasts prepared 
with dressing require more time. In roasting meats many think it 
better not to add any water until the meat has been in the oven 
about half an hour, or until it begins to brown. 

Broiling is the most wholesome method of cooking meats, and is 
most acceptable to invalids. Tough steak is made more tender by 
pounding or hacking with a dull knife, but some of -the juices are 
lost by the operation ; cutting it across in small squares with a Aarp 
knife on both sides is better than either. Tough meats are also 
improved by laying for two hours on a dish containing three or 
four table-spoons each of vinegar and salad oil (or butter), a little 
pepper, but no salt ; turn every twenty minutes. The action of the 
oil and vinegar softens the fibers without extracting their juices. 
Trim off all superfluous fat, but never wash a freshly-cut steak. 
Never salt or pepper steak or chops before or while cooking, but if 
very lean, dip in melted butter. Place the steak on a hot, well- 
greased gridiron, turn often so that the outside maybe seared at 
once ; when done, which will require from five to ten minutes, dish 
on a hot platter, season with salt and pepper and bits of butter, 
cover with, a hot platter and serve at once. A small pair of tonga 
are best U turn steaks, as piercing with a fork fi^ees the juices. If 
lat drips on the coals below, the blaze may be extinguished by 
sprinkling with salt, always withdrawing the gridiron to prevent the 



MEATS. 193 

Bteak firom acquiring a smoky flavor. Always have a brisk fire, 
whether you cook in a patent broiler directly over ilie fire, or on a 
gridiron over a bed of live coals. Broiling steak is the very last 
thing to be done in getting breakfast or dinner ; every other dish 
should be ready for the table, so that this may have the cook's un- 
divided attention. A bteel gridiron with slender bars is best, as the 
common broad, flat iron bars fry and scorch the meat, imparting & 
disagreeable flavor. In using the patent broilers, such as the 
*' American" and the later and better '* Dover,'' care must be used 
to keep all doors and lids of stove or range closed during the pro- 
cess. The dampers which shut off the draft to the chimney should 
be thrown open before beginning, to take the flames in that direc- 
tion. Never take the li J from broiler without first removing it from 
over the fire, as the smoke and flames rush out past the meat and 
smoke it 

Frying is properly cooking in fat enough to cover the article, and 
when the fat is hot, and properly managed, the food is crisped at 
the surface, and does not absorb the fat. The process of cooking in 
just enough fat to prevent sticking has not yet been named in Eng- 
lish, and is eatdemg^ but is popularly known as frying, and ought 
to be banished from all civilized kitchens. The secret of success in 
fiying is what the French call the ** surprise." The fire must be 
hot enough to sear the surface and make it impervious to the fat, 
and at the same time seal up the rich juices. As soon as the meat 
is browned by this sudden application of heat, the pan may be 
moved to a cooler place on the stove, that the process may be fin- 
ished more slowly. For instructions as to heating the fat, see what 
is said under head of ** Fritters." When improperly done, frying 
results in an unwholesome and greasy mess, unfit for food, but with 
care, plenty of fat (which may be used again and again), and the 
right degree of heat, nothing is easier than to produce a crisp, de- 
licious, and healthful dish. 

To thaw frozen meat, place in a warm room over night, or lay it 
for a few hours in cold water — the latter plan being the best. The 
ice which forms on the surfisu;e as it thaws is easily removed. If 
cooked before it is entirely thawed, it will be tough. Meat once 

frozen should not be allowed to thaw until just before cooking.

The moBt economical way to cut a ham is to slice, for the same 
meal, from the large end as well as from the thickest part ; in this 
way a part of best and a part of the less desirable is brought on, 
and the waste of the meal is from the poorest, as the best is eaten 
first. After cutting a ham, if not to be cut from again soon, rub 
the cut side with corn meal ; this prevents the ham from becoming 
rancid, and rubs off easily when the ham is needed again. 

Beef in boiling loses rather more than one-quarter ; in roasting it 
loses one-third ; legs of mutton lose one-fifth in boiling, and one- 
third in roasting, and a loin of mutton in roasting loses rather mors 
than a third. 

Beef suet may be kept a long time in a cool place without freez- 
ing, or by burying it deep in the fiour barrel so as to entirely ex- 
clude the air. 

The garnishes for meats are parsley, slices of lemon, sliced carrot, 
sliced beets, and currant jelly.

Broiled Beefsteak. 
Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron well greased with butter 
or beef Muet, over hot coals; when done on one side have ready the 
warmed platter with a little butter on it, lay the steak, without 
pressing it, upon the platter with the cooked side down so that the 
juices which have gathered may run on the platter, quickly place it 
again on gridiron, and cook the other side. When done to liking, 
put on platter again, spread lightly with butter, season with salt 
and pepper, and place where it will keep warm (over boiling steam 
is best) for a few moments, but do not let butter become oily. 
Serve on hot plates. Many prefer to sear on one side, turn imme« 
diately and sear the other, and finish cooking, turning often ; gar- 
nish with fried sliced potatoes, or with browned potato balls the size 
of a marble, piled at each end of platter. — Mrs, W, TT. Tf. 

Fried Beefsteak. 

When the means to broil are not at hand, the next best method 

is to heat the frying pan very hot, put in steak previously hacked, 

let remain a few moments, loosen with a knife and turn quickly 

several times ; repeat thb, and when done transfer to a hot platter.

and place where it ?dll keep hot while making the gravy. Place a 

table-spoon dry flour in the skillet, being sure to have the fat boiling 

hot, stir until brown and free from lumps (the bits of suet may be 

left in, drawing them tvi one side until the flour is browned), pour 

in about half a pint boilhig water (milk or cream is better), stir 

well, season with pepper and suit, and serve in a gravy tureen. 

Spread bits of butter over steak and send to table at once. This is 

more economical, but not so wholesome as broiling. 

Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. 

Slice the onions thin and drop in cold water: put steak in pan 
with a little suet. Skim out onions and add to steak, season with 
pepper and salt, cover tightly, and put over the fire. When the 
juice of the onions has dried up, and the meat has browned on one 
side, remove onions, turn steak, replace onions, and fry till done* 
being careful not to bum. 

Boiled Corned Beef. 

Soak over night if very salt, but if beef is young and properly 
corned this is not necessary; pour over it cold water enough to 
cover it well, after washing off* the salt. The rule for boiling meats 
fo twenty-five minutes to a pound, but corned beef should be placed 
on a part of the stove or range where it will simmer, not boil, un- 
interruptedly from four to six hours, according to the size of the 
piece. If to be served cold, some let the meat remain in the liquor 
until cold, and some let tough beef remain in the liquor until the 
next day, and bring it to the boiling point just before serving. Sim-

pieces of beef; press the meat firmly into a mold, pour over it the 
liquor, and place over it a close cover with a weight upon it. When 
turned iroin the mold, garnish with sprigs of parsley or celery, and 
serve with &ncy pickles or French mustard. — Mrs, S, H. J. 

Beef a La Mode. 
In a piece of the rump, cut deep openings with a sharp knife ; 
put in pieces of pork cut into dice, previously rolled in pepper, salt, 
cloves and nutmeg. Into an iron stew-pan lay pieces of pork, 
sliced onions, slices of lemon, one or two carrots and a bay-leaf; 
lay the meat on and put over it a piece of bread-crust as large as 
the hand, a half-pint wine and a little vinegar, and afterwards an 
equal quantity of water or broth, till the meat is half covered; 
cover the dish close and cook till tender. Then take it out, rub the 
gravy thoroughly through a sieve, skim ofi* the fiit, add some sour 
cream, return to the stew-pan and cook ten minutes. Instead of 
the cream, capers or sliced cucumber pickles can be added to the 
gravy if preferred, or a handful of grated ginger-bread or rye 
bread. The meat can also be laid for some days before in a spiced 
vinegar or wine pickle. — Mrs, L. S. WUlistoriy Heidelberg, Oermany, 

Boiled Beef Tongue. 
Wash clean, put in the pot with water to cover it, a pint of salt, 
and a small pod of red pepper ; if the water boils away, add more 
so as to keep the tongue nearly covered until done ; boil until it 
can be pierced easily with a fork, take out, and if needed for pres- 
ent use, take off the skin and set away to cool ; if to be kept some 
days, do not peel until wanted for table. The same amount of salt 
will do for three tongues if the pot is large enough to hold them, 
always remembering to keep sufficient water in the kettle to cover 
all while boiling. Soak salt tongue over night, and cook in same 
way, omitting the salt. Or, after peeling, place the tongue in sauce* 
pan with one cup water, one-half cup vinegar, four table-spoop« 
sugar, and cook till liquor is evaporated. — M. J. W.

a dozen cloves, a stick of cinnamon, and a little whole black pepper; 
cut gashes iu the meat, and stuff them with half pound of &t salt 
pork, cut into square bits ; place the meat on the other ingredients, 
and pour over them half a cup of vinegar aud a cup of water; 
cover tightly, and bake in a moderate oven ; cook slowly four or five 
hours, and, when about half done, salt to taste. When done, take 
oat the meat, strain the gravy through a colander and thicken with 
flour. — Mrs, D. W. R,, WaahingUm City. 

Roast Beef with Pudding. 
Bake exactly as directed for ordinary roast for the table ; then 
make a Yorkshire pudding, to eat like vegetables with the roost, as 
foUows: For every pint of milk take three eggs, three cups of flour, 
and a pinch of salt ; stir to a smooth batter, and pour into the drip- 
ping-pan under the meat, half an hour before it is done. — Mrs, C 

T, Carson. 

Roast Beef. 

Take a rib-piece or loin-roast of seven to eight pounds. Beat it 
thoroughly all over, lay it in the roasting dish and baste it with 
melted butter. Put it inside the well-heated" oven, and baste fre- 
quently with its own fiit, which will make it brown and tender. If, 
when it is cooking fast, the gravy is growing too brown, turn a 
glass of Grerman cooking wine into the bottom of the pan, and 
repeat this as often as the gravy cooks away. The roast needs 
about two hours time to be done, and must be brown outside but 
inside still a little red. Season with salt and pepper. Squeeze a 
little lemon juice over it, and also turn the gravy upon it, after 
skimming ofi^ all fat. — Mrs. L. S. Willis^, Heidelberg , Germany. 

A Brown Stew. 
Put on stove a rather thick piece of beef with little bone and 
some fet; four hours before needed, pour on just boUing water 
enough to cover, cover with a close-fitting lid, boil gently, and as 
the water boils away add only just enough from time to time to 
keep from burning, so that when the meat is tender, the water may

all be boiled away, as the fat will allow the meat to brown without 
burning ; turn occasionally, brown evenly over a slow fire, and make 
a gravy, by stirring flour and water together and adding to the 
drippings ; season with salt an hour before it is done. — Mrs. Geba 
Hull 

Stewed Beef. 

Take a piece of the rump, pound it till tender, lay in an iron 
ver^sel previously lined with slices of pork and onions, with a few 
pepper-corns, dredge it with salt, and baste with melted butter. 
Cover close, over a good heat, and when it has fried a nice brown, 
add one pint German cooking wine and as much more good soup 
stock, and stew it till soft. Before serving, take out the meat, skim 
off the fat, add a table-8i)Oon of flour mixed smooth with broth, add 
gradually still more broth, strain it through a sieve and turn over the 
previously dished meat. The meat can be laid for some days before 
in vinegar, or in a spiced pickle, or be basted with either occasionally 
instead of lying in it. 

Spiced Beef Tongue. 

Rub into the tongue a mixture of half a pint of sugar, a piece 
of saltpeter the size of a pea, and a table-spcjon of ground cloves ; 
immerse it in a brine made of three-fourths pound salt to two quarts 
water, taking care that it is kept covered ; let lie two weeks, take 
out, wash well, and dry with a cloth ; roll out a thin paste made of 
flour and water, wrap the tongue in it, and put it in pan to bake ; 
bake slowly, basting well with lard and water ; when done, remove 
paste and skin, and serve. 

Fried Liver. 

Cut in thin slices and place on a platter, pour on boiling water 
and immediately pour it off (this seals the outside, takes away the 
unpleasant flavor, and makes it much more palatable) ; have ready 
in skillet on the stove, some hot lard or beef drippings, or both 
together, dredge the liver with rolled crackers or dried bread- 
crumbs rolled fine and nicely seasoned with pepper and salt, put 
in skillet, placing the tin cover on, fry slowly until both sides are 
dark-brown, when the liver will be thoroughly cooked. The tim6 
required is about a quarter of an hour.

Fried Tripe. 

Dredge with flour, or dip in egg and cracker crumbs, fry in hot 
butter, or other fat, until a delicate brown on both sides, ]ay it on a 
dish, add vinegar to the gravy, and pour over the tripe (or the 
vinegar may be omitted, and the gravy added, or the tripe may be 
served without vinegar or gravy). Or make a batter by mixing 
gradually one cup of flour with one of sweet milk, then add an egg 
well beaten and a little salt ; drain the iripe, dip in Imtter, and fry 
in hot drippings or lard. Salt pork and pig's-feet may be cooked 
by the same rule. In buying tripe get the ** honey-combed."

Leg of Mutton a la Venison. 
Remove all rough fat from a leg of mutton, lay in a deep 
earthen dish, and rub into the meat very thoroughly the following 
mixture: One table-sp(X)n salt, one each of celery, salt, brown 
sugar, black pepper, made mustard, allspice, and sweet herbs mixed 
and powdered. After these have been rubl)ed into all parts of 
meat, pour over it slowly a tea-cup good vinegar, cover tightly and 
set in a cool place for four or ^wq days, turning ham, and basting 
it with liquid three or four times a day. To cook, leave in a clean 
kettle a quart boiling water, have in kettle an inverted tin-pan or 
rack made for the purpose ; on it lay ham just as taken out of 
pickle ; cover kettle tightly, and stew for four hours. Do not allow 
water to touch the meat. Add a tea-cup of hot water to the pickle*

and baste the ham mth it. When ready to serve, thicken the 
liquid in the kettle with flour, strain through a fine strainer, and 
serve the meat with it and a relish of currant jelly. 

Frogs. 

Frogs may be broiled, or made into a fricassee seasoned with 

tomato catsup. The hind legs alone are eaten, and are a great 

delicacy. 

Fricatelu. 

Chop raw fresh pork very fine, add a little salt, plenty of pepper, 

and two small onions chopped fine, half as much bread as there is 

meat, soaked until soft, two eggs ; mix well together, make into 

oblong patties, and fry like oysters. These are nice for breakfast; 

if used for supper, serve with sliced lemon. — Mrs. W, F. WUcox. 

Boned Ham. 

Having soaked a well-cured ham in tepid water over night, boil 

it till perfectly tender, putting it on in warm water ; take up in a 

wooden tray, let cool, remove bone carefully, press the ham again 

into shape, return to boiling liquor, remove pot from fire, and let 

the ham remain in it till cold. Cut across and serve cold. — Miss 

L. L, Richmond. 

Boiled Ham. 

Pour boiling water over it and let stand until cool enough to wash, 

scrape clean (some have a coarse hair-brush on purpose for cleaning 

hams), put in a thoroughly cleansed boiler with cold water enougn 

to cover; bring to the boiling point and then place on back part of 

stove to simmer steadily for six or seven hours or till tender when 

pierced with a fork (if the ham weighs twelve pounds) ; be care- 

ful to keep water at boiling point, and not to allow it to go much 

above it Turn the ham once or twice in the water ; when done 

take up and put into a baking-pan to skin ; dip the hands in cold 

water, take the skin between the fingers and peel as you would an 

orange; set in a moderate oven, placing the leab side of the ham 

downward, and if you like, sift over pounded or rolled crackers ; 

bake one hour. The baking brings out a great quantity of fat, 

leaving the meat much more delicate, and in warm weather it will 

keep in a dry, cool place a long time ; if there is a tendency to mold, 

set it a little while into the oven again. Or, after the ham is boiled

and peeled, eover with the white of a raw egg, and sprinkle sugar 
or fine bread-crumrbs over it ; or eover with a regular cake-icing, 
plaee in the oven and brown ; or, quarter two onions, stick whole 
allspioe and black pepper in the quarters, with a knife make slits 
in the outside of the ham in which put the onions, place in dripping- 
pan, lay parsley around, and bake till nicely browned. Or, after 
boiling and peeling, dust with sugar, and pass a hot knife over it 
until it forms a caramel glaze, and serve without baking. A still ' 
nicer way is to glaze with strong meat jelly or any savory jelly at 
hand, boiled down rapidly (taking great care to prevent burning) 
until it is like glue. Brush this jelly over the ham when cool, and 
it makes it an elegant dish. The nicest portion of a boiled ham 
may be served in slices, and the ragged parts and odds and ends 
chopped fine for sandwiches, or by adding three eggs to one pint 
of chopped ham a delicious omelet may be made. If the ham is 
very salt, it should lie in water over night 

Broiled Ham. 
Cut the ham in slices of medium thickness, place on a hot grid- 
iron, and broil until the hX readily flows out and the meat is slightly 
browned, take from the gridiron with a knife and fork, drop into a 
pan of cold water, then return again to the gridiron, repeat several 
times, and the ham is done ; place in a hot platter, add a few lumps 
of butter, and serve at once. If too fiit, trim ofi* a part ; it is almost 
impossible to broil the fat part without burning, but this does not 
impair the taste. Pickled pork and breakilEist bacon may be broiled 
in the same way. — Mrs. A. E. Brand, 

Delicious Pried Ham. 
Place the slices in boiling water and cook till tender; put in fry- 
ing-pan and brown, and dish on a platter; fry some eggs by dripping 
gravy over them until done, instead of turning ; take up careAiUy and 
lay them on the slices of ham. — Mn. J. F. W 

Baked Piq. 
Take a pig about six weeks old, nicely prepared, score in squares, 
and rub lard all over it; make a dressing of two quarts of com 
meal salted as if for bread, and mix to a stiff bread with boiling 
water; make into pans and bake. After this is baked brown, break 
it up, and add to it one-fourth pound of butter, pepper to taste. 



MEATS. 208 

and thyme. Fill the pig till plump, sew it up, and place it on its 

knees in the pan, which fill with as much water as will cook it. 

Baste it very frequently with the gravy, also two red pepper pods. 

Turn while baking same as turkey, and continue to baste till done. 

8ome use turkey-dressing instead of above. — Mn. M, L. Blanton, 

NcuhviUe^ Tenn. 

Spar£>-rib Pot-pie. 

Cut the spare-ribs once across and then in strips three or four 
uiches wide, put on in kettle with hot water enough to cover, stew 
until tender, season with salt and pepper, and turn out of kettle ; 
replace a layer of spare-ribs in the bottom, add a layer of peeled 
potatoes (quartered if large), some bits of butter, some small squares 
of baking-powder dough rolled quite thin, season again, then another 
layer of spare-ribs, and so on until the kettle is two-thirds full, 
leaving the squares of crust for the last layer ; then add the liquor 
in which the spare-ribs were boiled, and hot water if needed, cover, 
boil half to three-quarters of an hour, being careful to add hot water 
BO as not to let it boil dry. The crust can be made of light biscuit 
dough, without egg or sugar, as follows: Boll thin, cut out, let rise, 
and use for pie, remembering to have plenty of water in the kettle, 
80 that when the pie is made and the cover on, it need not be re- 
moved until dished. If, after taking up, there is not sufficient 
gravy, add hot water and flour and butter rubbed together ; season 
to taste, and serve. To warm over pot-pie, sec u in a dnppmg-pan 
in the oven, add lumps of butter with gravy or hot water ; more 
squares of dough may be laid on the top. — Mn, W. W. W. 

PiGS*-PEET Souse. 
Cut off the homy parts of feet and toes, scrape, clean, and wash 
thoroughly, singe off the stray hairs, place in a kettle with plenty 
of water, boil, skim, pour off water and add fresh, and boil until the 
bones will pull out easily ; do not bone, but pack in a stone jar with 
pepper and salt sprinkled between each layer; cover with good 
cider vinegar. When wanted for the table, take out a sufficient 
quantity, put in a hot skillet, add more vinegar, salt, and pepper 
tf needed, boil until thoroughly heated, stir in a smooth thicken- 
ing of flour and water, and boil until flour is cooked ; serve hot as 
a nice breakfast dish. Or, when the feet have boiled until perfectly 



204 MEATS. 

tender, remove the bones and pack in stone jar as above ; slice 
down cold when wanted for use. Let the liquor in which the feet are 
boiled stand over night ; in the morning remove the fat and pre- 
pare and preserve for use as directed in the Medical Department 

Pia's-HEAD Cheese. 
Having thoroughly cleaned a hog's or pig's head, split it in two, 
take out the eyes and the brain; clean the ears, throw scalding 
water over the head and ears, then scrape them well ; when very 
clean, put in a kettle with water to cover it, and set it over a rathei 
quick fire ; skim it as any scum rises ; when boiled so that the flesh 
leaves the bones, take it from the water with a skimmer into a larg6 
wooden bowl or tray ; then take out every particle of bone, chop the 
meat fine, season to taste with salt and pepper (a little pounded 
sage may be added), spread a cloth over the colander, put the meat 
in, fold cloth closely over it, lay a weight on it so that it may press 
the whole surface equally (if it be lean use a heavy weight, if &t, 
a lighter one) ; when cold take off weight, remove from colander, 
and place in crock. Some add vinegar in proportion of one pint to 
a gallon crock. Clarify the &.t from the cloth, colander, and liquor 
of the pot, and use for frying. 

Fried Porkbteaks. 
Fry like beefiteaks, with pepper and salt ; or sprinkle with dry 
powdered sage if the sausage flavor is liked. — Mr%. B. A. Fay. 

Fried Salx* Pork. 
Cut in rather thin slices, and freshen by lettbg lie an hour or two 
in cold water or milk and water, roll in flour and fry till crisp (}f 
in a hurry, pour boiling water on the slices, let stand a few minutes, 
drian, roll in flour and fry as before) ; drain off most of the grease 
from frying-pan, sdr in while hot one or two table-spoons of flour, 
about half a pint new milk, a little pepper, and salt if not salt 
enough already from the meat ; let boil and pour into gravy dish. 
This makes a nice white gravy when properly made. 

BoABT Pork. 
A small loin of pork, three table-spoons bread-crumbs, one onion, 
half a tea-spoob chopped sage, half tea-spoon salt, half tea-spoon 
pepper, one ounce chopped suety one table-spoon drippings. Sepa- 



MEATS. 206 

rate each joint of the loin with the chopper, and then make an in- 
<usion with a knife into the thick part of the pork in which to put 
the stuffing. Prepare the stuffing by mixing the bread-crumbs 
together with the onion, which must have previously been finely 
chopped. Add to this the sage, pepper, salt and suet, and when all 
is thoroughly mixed, press the mixture snugly into the incision 
already made in the pork, and sew together the edges of the meat 
with needle and thread, to confine the stuffing. Grease well a shet t 
of kitchen paper, with drippings, place the loin into this, securing 
it with a wrapping of twine. Put to bake in a dry baking-pan, in 
a brisk oven, basting immediately and constantly as the grease draws 
out, and roast a length of time, allowing twenty minutes to the 
pound and twenty minutes longer. Serve with apple>sauce or apple- 
fritters. — Miss M. L, Dods. 

Roast 8par£-rib. 
Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack the ribs across the middle, 
rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff with turkey- 
dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping-pan with pint of water, 
baste frequently, turning over once so as to bake both sides equaUy 
antil a rich brown. 

Yankee Pork and Beans. 
Pick over carefully a quart of beans and let them soak over 
night ; in the morning wash and drain in another water, put on to 
boil in cold water with half a teaspoon of soda ; boil about thirty 
minutes (when done the skin of a bean will crack if taken out and 
blown upon), drain, and put in an earthen^pot first a slice of pork 
and then the beans, with two or three tablenspoons of molasses. 
When the beans are ip the pot, put in the center half or three, 
fi>urths of a pound of well-washed salt pork with the rind scored in 
slices or squares, and uppermost, season with pepper and salt if 
needed ; cover all with hot water, and bake six hours or longer in 
a moderate oven, adding hot water as needed ; they can not be 
baked too long. Keep covered so that they will not bum on the 
top, but remove cover an hour or two before serving, to brown the 
top and crisp the pork. This is the Yankee dish for Sunday breakiast 
It is often baked the day before, allowed to remain in the oven all 



^ MEATS, 

night, and browned in the morning. Serve in the dish in which 

they are cooked, and always have enough left to know the luxury 

of cold beans, or baked beans warmed over. If salt pork is too 

robust for the appetites to be served, season delicately with salt, 

pepper, and a little butter, and roast a fresh spare-rib to serve with 

them. 

Fried Veal Cutlets. 

Make a batter of half pint of milk, a well-beaten egg, and flour; 
fry the veal brown in sweet lard or beef-drippings, dip it in the 
batter and fry again till brown ; drop some spoonfuls of batter in 
the hot lard after the veal is taken up, and serve them on top of 
the meat ; put a little flour paste in the gravy with salt and pepper^ 
let it come to a boil and pour it over the whole. The veal should 
be cut thin, pounded, and cooked nearly an hour. Cracker crumbs 
and egg may be used instead of batter, but the skillet should then 
be kept covered, and the veal cooked slowly for half lUi hour over 
a moderate fire. If a gravy is wanted sprinkle a little flour in the 
pan, add salt and pepper and a little water, let come to a boil, and 
pour over the cutlets ; or, pound well, squeeze juice of lemon over 
the slices, let stand an hour or two, dip in beaten egg and then in 
fine bread-crumbs (if no stale bread is at hand dry slices in a cool 
oven), plunge at once into hot fat enough to cover. The slices wiU 
brown before they are thoroughly cooked, and the pan should be 
drawn aside to a cooler place to '* finish" more slowly. 

Fish may be fried in the same way; when done the meat will sep- 
arate readily from the bone when a knife is inserted. They may be 
dipped in milk and tlsn in flour, instead of in egg and bread- 
crumbs ; sift salt evenly over the meat or fish just before serving. 
The bread-crumbs should be fine; if coarse, they crumble ofi" with 

the egg in cooking. 

Veal Loaf. 

Chop fine three pounds of leg or loin of veal and three-fourths 
pound salt pork, chopped finely together; roll one dozen crackers, 
put half of them in the veal with two eggs, season with pepper and 
a little salt if needed; mix all together and make into a solid fi^rm; 
then take the crackers that are left and spread smoothly over the 
outside ; bake one hour, and eat cold. — Oov. Tilden, N, Y. 



MEATS. 207 

Boast Loin op Veal. 

Wash and rub thoroughly with salt and pepper, leaving m the 
iddnej, around which put plenty of salt; roll up, let stand two 
hours ; in the meantime make dressing of bread-crumbs, salt, pep- 
per, and chopped parsley or thyme moistened with a little hot 
water and butter — some prefer chopped salt pork — also add an egg. 
Unroll the veal, put the dressing well around the kidney, fold, and 
secure well with several yards white cotton twine, covering the 
meat in all directions; place in the dripping-pan with the thick 
aide down, put to bake in a rather hot oven, graduating it to 
moderate heat afterward ; in half an hour add a little hot water to 
the pan, baste often ; in another half hour turn over the roast, and 
when nearly done, dredge lightly with flour, and baste with melted 
batter. Before serving, carefully remove the twine. A four-pound 
roast thus prepared will bake thoroughly tender in about two hours. 
To make the gravy, skim off fat if there is too much in the drippings, 
dredge some flour in the pan, stir until it browns, add some hot 
water if necessary, boil a few moments and serve in gravy-boat. 
This roast is very nice to slice down cold for Sunday dinners. 
Serve with green pease and lemon jelly. 

Stewed Kidney. 

Boil kidneys the night before till very tender, turn meat and 
gravy into a dish and cover over. In the morning, boil for a few 
moments, thicken with flour and water, add part of an onion chopped 
very fine, pepper, salt, and a lump of butte^and pour over toasted 
broad well buttered. — Mrs. E. L. F. 

Veal Stew. 

Boil two and a half pounds of the breast of veal one hour in 
water enough to cover, add a dozen potatoes, and cook half an hour ; 
before taking off the stove, add one pint of milk and flour enough 
to thicken ; season to taste. If preferred, make a crust as for 
chicken-pie, bake in two pie-pans, place one of the crusts on tlie 
platter, pour over the stew, and place the other on top. — KaJte Thomp- 
Wij JliIiBerAurg, Ky.

Sweet-Bbeadb. 

These are great delicacies. There are two in a calf, one from 
neck called *' throat sweet-bread," the other firom near the heart 
called ''heart sweet-bread." The latter is most delicate. Select 
the largest The color should be clear and a shade darker than the 
&t Before cooking let the sweet- breads lie for half an hour in 
lukewarm water, then throw into boiliiig water to blanch and 
harden, and then into cold water to cool ; after which draw off the 
outer casing, remove the little pipes, and cut into thin slices. Sweet- 
breads do not keep well, and should be fresh, and must be kept in 
a cold, dry place. They should be thoroughly cooked. In lard- 
ing sweet-bread, take deep, long stitches, or they will break out. 

To broil, prepare as above, spread plenty of butter over them» 
and broil on a gridiron over hot coals, turning often. 

To fricassee, cut up the remnant of a cooked sweet-bread in small 
pieces, prepare a gravy by melting two table-spoons butter and 
stirring in a table-spoon flour, and adding a tea-cup of soup stock 
or water; lay pieces of sweet-bread in pan with gravy, season with 
pepper and salt, and boil up once. Garnish with sliced lemon or 
pieces of fried bread. If sweet-breads are fresh, cut into thin slices, 
let simmer slowly in the gravy for three-quarters of an hour, and 
add a well-beaten egg, two table-spoons cream, and a spoonful 
chopped parsley ; stir all together for a few minutes, and serve im- 
mediately. 

To fry, parboil five minutes, wipe dry, lard with narrow stripe of 
salt fat pork with a larding-needle, put a very little butter or lard 
into a frying-pan, lay m the sweet-breads when it is hot, and fry to 
a crisp brown, turning often. Or, slice thin, sprinkle over grated 
nutmeg and chopped parsley, dip into a batter made of one cup 
milk, one egg, one cup of flour, a pinch of salt, and a half tea- 
spoon baking-powder, and fry like fritters. 

To roast, parboil large ones, and, when cold, lard yrith salt pork 
as above. Boast brown in a moderate oven, basting often with 
butter and water. Serve with white sauce or tomato sauce poured 
over them. For sweet-breads with green pease, lard five sweet-breads 
with strips of salt pork (project evenly about half an inch on the 
upper side), put on the fire with a half pint water, and let stew 



MEA!n8. 209 

alowly for half an hour, take out and put in a small dripping-pan 
with a little butter and a sprinkle of flour ; brown slightly, add half 
a gill of mingled milk and water, and sea^n with pepper ; heat a 
half pint of cream, and stir it in the gravy in the pan. Have pease 
ready boiled and seasoned, place the sweet-breads in the center of 
the disb, pour the gravy over them, and put pease around them. 

Veal with Oysters. 

Fry two pounds tender veal cut in thin bits, and dredged witli 

flour, in sufficient hot lard to prevent sticking ; when nearly done 

add one and a half pints of fine oysters, thicken with flour, season 

with salt and pepper, and cook until done. Serve hot in covered dish. 

Stuffed Heart. 

Take a beeFs or sheep's or veal's heart, wash deeply and thoroughly 
80 as to remove all blood, make the two cells into one by cutting 
through the partition with a long, sharp knife, being careful not to 
cut through to the outside ; make a stufling of bread crumbs same 
as for roast turkey, fill the cavity, cover with greased paper or cloth 
to secure stuffing, and bake in a deep pan with plenty of water, for 
two hours or longer, basting and turning often, as the upper part 
particularly is apt to get dry. While heart is roasting, put the valves 
or ^* deaf ears," which must be cut ofl* after washing, into a sauce- 
pan, with pint of cold water and a sliced onion. Let simmer slowly 
one hour ; melt in saucepan tablespoon of butter, add a tablespoon 
flour, then the strained liquor from valves, and serve as gravy. 

Veal or Chicken pot-pie. 

Put two or three pounds veal (a piece widi ribs is .good), cut in a 
dozen pieces, in a quart of cold water ; make a quart of soda-bis- 
cuit dough, take two-thirds of dongh, roll to a fourth of an inch 
thick, cut in strips one inch wide by three long ; pare and slice six 
potatoes ; boil veal till tender, take out all but three or four pieces, 
put in two handfuls of potatoes and several strips of dough, then 
add pieces of veal and dough, seasoning with salt, pepper, and a 
little butter, until all the veal is in pot ; add boiling water enough 
to cover, take rest of dough, roll out to size of ])ot, cut several holes 
to let steam escape, and place over the whole. Put on a tight lid 
and boil (gently) twenty or thirty minutes mthovt uncovering.

PASTRY. 



Butter or lard for pastry should be sweet, fresh and solid. 
When freshly-made butter can not be had, wash well, kneading 
while under cold water, changing the water t\vo or three times, and 
then wiping dry with a napkin. The board on which the butter is 
rolled should be hard and smooth, and never used for any other 
purpose. 

A very nice paste for family use may be made by reducing the 
quantity of shortening to even so little as a half pound to a quart 
of flour, especially when children or dyspeptics are to be considered. 
With the exception of mince-pies, which are warmed over before 
serving, all pies should be eaten the day they are baked. In warm 
weather, when not ready to bake immediately after making up 
paste, keep it in the ice-chest till wanted, several days if necessary, 
and, in any event, it is better to let it thus remain for one or two 
hours. Roll always with a weU-jUmred rolling-pin. 

To prevent the juicf of pies from soaking into the under crust, 
beat an egg well, and with a bit of cloth dipped into the egg, rub 
over the crust before filling the pies. 

For a more wholesome pie-crust shortening, boil beans or potatoes 
until soft, make into a broth, work through a colander, mix as much 
into the flour as can be done and preserve suflicient tenacity in the 
dough. Knead moderately stifl*, and roll a little thicker than crust 
shortened with lard. It is a good plan to make a puif-paste for the 
top crust, and for the under crust use less shortening. 

When using green currants, pie-plant, gooseberries, or other fruitd" 
which require the juice to be thickened, fill the lower crust, sprinkle 



PAJSTRY. 211 

com starch evenly over, and put on the upper crust. This pre- 
vents the juice from running over, and, when cold, forms a nice 
jelly. Do not sprinkle with sugar uutil the fruit is placed in the 
crust, as the sugar sets the juice free. In all pies with top crust, 
make air-holes, or the crust will burst. These may be arranged in 
any fanciful shape, and are best made by the point of the bowl of 
an inverted teanspoon pressed through the crust while on the board, 
and gently drawn apart when taken up to put over the fire. Mer- 
ingue, for pies or puddings, is made in the proportion of one table- 
spoon sugar to white of one egg, with flavoring added. Never fill 
pies until just before putting tliem iu the oven. Always use tin 
pie-pans, since, in earthen pans, the under crust is not likely to be 
well baked. Just before putting on the upper crust, wet the rim 
of the lower with the finger dipped in water, or with a thick paste 
of flour and water, or egg and flour, and press the two crusts firmly 
together; this will prevent that bane of all pastry cooks — a burst 
pie. Bake fruit pies in a moderate oven, having a better heat at 
the bottom than at the top of the oven, or the lower crust will be 
clammy and raw. When done, the crust will separate from the 
pan, so that the pie may be easily removed. Remove at once frx)m 
the tins, or the crust will become ** soggy.** 

The secret of success in making pufl'-paste is to secure the great- 
est possible number of layers of butter and dough (alternately) as 
the result of folding and rolling. This is best accomplished, as will 
readily be perceived, by increasing the quantity of butter; the more 
you use, the greater the number of layers before the butter is ex- 
hausted by absorption into the dough. Ob the other hand, too 
much butter produces equally bad results; a quantity of butter 
equal to the flour is the most, and three-fourths pound of butter 
to a pound of flour the least, that can be used in pufl'-paste with 
good results. For pastry for the family table the proportion of 
butter may be reduced to one-fourth as much butter as flour, and 
lard or suet may be substituted for butter. 

In making pufl-paste, it is a mistake to suppose that lessening the 
quantity of butter is economical. For instance, tartlets cut one- 
fourth of an inch thick from paste made with half a pound of but- 
ter to a pound of flour, will not be any thicker or higher when 



212 PASTRY, 

baked than thoee cut from paste half as thick made with 
three-fourths pound butter to a pound of flour. Thus, bj using one- 
fourth more butter double the bulk results, besides the satisfaction 
of having good light pastry. In washing or egging pastry, be care- 
ful not to allow the egg or milk, or whatever \a used, to run down 
over the edges, or, as it sets by the heat of the oven, it will bind 
the edges and prevent them from opening fully. lu rolling, use 
the rolling-pin as lightly as possible, and take care that the pressure 
is even. The layers will be even or uneven just in proportion as 
the pressure is even or uneven. Be careful not to break the dough, 
or the butter will be forced through, and thus destroy the evenness 
of the layers. K the dough breaks, cover it with a piece of '' plain 
dough," dust it well with flour, and continue rolling. (It is well 
to keep a piece of plain dough in reserve for this purpose.) 

Aunty Phelps' Pie Crust. 
To one pint of sifted flour, add one even tea-spoon baking powder, 
and sweet cream enough to wet the flour, leaving crust a little stiff 
This is enough for two pies. 

Good Common Paste. 
One cofiee-cup lard, three of sifted flour, and a little salt. In 
winter soften the lard a little (but not in summer), cut it well into 
the flour with a knife, then mix' with cold water quickly into a 
moderately stiff dough, handling as little as possible. This makes 
four common-sized covered pies. Take a new slice of paste each 
time for top crust Aft»r rolling spread with a tea-spoon, butter, 
fold and roll again, using the trimmings, etc., for under crust— 
Jlfi88 KaJty Rupp, 

Graham Paste. 

Mix lightly half a pound Graham flour, half a pint sweet cream, 
half a teaspoon salt, roll, and bake like other pastry. 

Puff Paste. 
Take three-fourths pound of butter (be sure that it is of the best 
quality), free it from salt (by working it in water), form it in a 
square lump, and place it in flour for half an hour to harden ; place 
one pound of flour in a bowl, take two ounces of butter and rub it 
''fine" into the flour, wet the flour into dough with cold water. 



PASTRY. 213 

tnaking it a& neai at> po68ible the same consistency as the butter 
(so that ihkj two will roll out evenly together) ; now place the dough 
on the pastry board, dust it under and over with flour, and rdll it 
out in a piece 3ay twelve inches long and six wide ; now flour butter 
well, and roll that out in a sheet about eight inches long and five 
wide, (this will cover about three-fourths of the dough, leaving one- 
fourth of the dough, and about half an inch around the sides and 
top edge, without butter). Place the sheet of butter on the dough 
as described ; take half a ^ea-spoon cream tartar, mix it with twice 
its bulk of flour, and sprinkle it evenly over the butter ; now fold 
the one-fourth not covered with butter, over on the butter, then 
fold the other part with the butter on it over on that, and you will 
then have three layers of dough and two of butter. Boll out to its 
original size, dust with flour, fold it as before, roll out again, dust 
with flour, and fold again ; repeat twice more, giving it four rollings 
and. foldings ; when rolled out for the last time, cut it through in 
two even pieces, and place one on the other, and the paste is ready 
to roll in any shape desired. 

In warm weather it is necessary to place it in a cool place after 
every second rolling ; in very warm weather after each rolling, and 
sometimes on ice. A good, firm, tough butter is best for the pur- 
pose. Take care not to use carbonate of soda or saleratus instead 
of cream tartar ; use a sharp cutter to cut out tartlets ; give a rapid 
downward cut so that it will cut, not drag through, so that the 
layera may not be pressed together, so as to prevent their opening 
leadily when baking, thus preventing the tartlets from raising fully. 
Afker they are cut, place them on the pans or in the patty-pans 
upside down, because the cutter in dividing the paste presses down- 
ward toward the board, closing the layers, and if placed in oven

open fully, consequently do not rise well, but, if inverted, the layers

PuFP Paste. 

One heaping pound superfine sifted flour, one of butter, which 
has first been folded in a napkin and gently pressed to remove all 



214 PASTRY. 

moisture; place the flour on board (or marble slab is better), make 
a well in center, squeeze in juice of half a lemon, and add yolk of 
one egg, beaten with a little ice- water; stir with one hand and drop 
in ice-water with the other, until the paste is as hard as the butter ; 
roll paste out in a smooth square an inch thick, smooth sides with 
a rolling-pin, spread the butter over half the paste; lay the other 
half over like an old-fashioned turn -over, leave it for fifteen min< 
utes in a cold place, then roll out in a long strip, keeping the edges 
smooth, and double it in three parts, as follows: Fold one-third over 
on the middle third, roll it down, then fold over the other outside 
third, roll out in a long strip and repeat the folding process — ^rolling 
across this time so that the butter may not run ''in streaks" by 
being always rolled the same way ; let it lie for fifteen minutes, and 
repeat this six times, allowing fifteen minutes between each rolling 
to cooj, otherwise the butter will " oil," and the paste is ready for 
use. Handle as little as possible through the whole process. All 
the flour used must be of the very best quality, and thoroughly 
sifted. The quantity of water depends on the capacity of the flour 
toabserb it, which is quite- variable. Too little makes the paste 
toug\, and too much makes it thin, and prevents the flakiness so 
desirable. Rich paste requires a quick oven. This may be made 
in one-fourth the quantity given above, and is then much more 
easily handled. — Jlrs. Fl Cr. Hmliy MiiuieapoliSy Minn, 

Paste with Suet. 
Roll a half-pound of the best suet, with very little membrane 
running through it, on a board for several minutes, removing all 
the skin and fibers that appear when rolling ; the suet will be a 
pure and sweet shortening, looking like butter; or the suet may 
be chop})ed fine and the fibers removed. Rub the suet into a 
pouHrd of flour, add a tea-spoon salt,- and mix it with a half 
pint of ice-water ; roll out for the plates, and put on a little butter 
in flakes, rolling it in as usual. Some add a tea-spoon baking- 
powder. 

Apple Meringue Pie. 

Pare, slice, stew and sweeten ripe, tart and juicy apples, mash 
and season with nutmeg, (or stew lemon peel with them for flavor), 
fill crust and bake till done ; spread over the apple a thick meringue

made bj whipping to froth whites of three eggs for each pie, sweet- 
ening with three table-spoons powdered sugar ; flavor with vanilla, 
beat until it will stand alone, and cover pie three-quarters of an 
inch thick. Set back in a quick oven till well '' set/' and eat cold. 
In their season substitute peaches for apples. 

Apple Custard Pie. 
Peel sour apples and stew until soft, and not much water is left 
in them, and rub through a colander. Beat three eggs for each 
pie. Put in in proportion of one cup butter, and one of sugar for 
three pies. Season with nutmeg. — Mrs, D. G, Oroas, 

Dried Apple Pie. 

Very good pies may be made of the ** Alden " dried apples, by 

stewing in a very little water ; sweeten and make like any other. 

The home dried apples are best when stewed very soft, and mashed 

through a colander. When stewing put in two or three small pieces 

of lemon or orange peel (previously dried and saved for cooking 

purposes); flavor with a very little spice of any kind. Sweeten and 

season before putting into the pie-pan. A beaten egg may be stirred 

m. Bake with two crusts, rolled thin, and warm slightly before 

eating. 

Sliced- APPLE Pie. 

Line pie-pan with crust, sprinkle with sugar, fill with tart apples 
sliced very thin, sprinkle sugar and a very little cinnamon over 
them, and add a few small bits of butter, and a table-spoon 
water; dredge in flour, .cover with the top crust, and bake 
half to three-quarters of an hour ; allow four or five table-spoons 
sugar to one pie. Or, line pans with crurt, fill with sliced apples, 
put on top crust and bake ; take ofl* top crust, put in sugar, bits of 
butter and seasoning, replace crust and serve warm. It is delicious 
with sweetened cream. Crab-apple pie, if made of '' Transcend- 
ents," will fully equal those made of larger varieties of the apple. — 

ifrg. D. Buxton. 

Banana Pie. 

Slice raw bananas, add butter, sugar, allspice and vinegar, or 

boiled cider, or diluted jelly; bake with two crusts. Cold boiled 

sweet potatoes may be used instead of bananas, and are very nice.

nutmeg over the mixture, and bake in two pies without upper 

crusts. — Mrs. Henry C. Meredith. 

Whipped Cream Pie. 
Bweeten with white sugar one tea-cup very thick sweet cream, 
made as cold as possible without freezing, and flavor with lemon 
or vanilla to taste; beat until as light as eggs for frosting, and keep 
cool until the crust is ready ; make crust moderately rich, prick well 
with a fork to prevent blistering, bake, spread on the cream, and 
to add finish put bits of jelly over the top. The above will make 
two pies. — Mrs, A. M. Alexander y HarrUburg. 

Crumb Pie.

Custard Pie. 

Heat one quart good rich milk in n tin-pan set in a skillet of hot 

water; take five eggs," four large table-spoons sugar, and a little 

salt, beat sugar and eggs a little, and pour in the milk ; flavor to 

Bnit the taste and have oven hot when put in to bake. Then cook 

bIowIj so as not to boil, as that spoils it ; test with a knife, when 

done it will not stick to blade. Without the crust, this makes a 

delicious baked custard. Bake in a deep tin — Mrs, C. B, Boody, 

JCiMoveny 

Custard Pie. 

For a large pie, take three eggs, one pint of milk, half cup sugar, 

and flavor. The crust for custard pies may be baked (not too hard) 

before putting in the custard ; prick it before putting it in oven to 

prevent blistering. This prevents it from becoming soggy, — Mrs, 

N. S. Long. 

Chess Pie. 

Three ^gs, two-thirds cup sugar, half cup butter (half cup milk 

may be added if not wanted so rich) ; beat butter to a cream, then 

add yolks and si|gar beaten to a froth with the flavoring ; stir all 

together rapidly, and bake in a nice crust. When done, spread 

with the beaten whites, and three table-spoons sugar and a little 

flavoring. Return to oven, and brown slightly. This makes one

Cherry Pie. 
Line a pie-tin with rich crust ; nearly fill with the carefuUj 
seeded finiit, sweeten to taste, and sprinkle evenly with a tea-spoon 
corn-starch or a table-spoon flour, add a table-spoon of butter cut 
into small bits and scattered over the top ; wet edge of crust, put on 
upper crust, and press the edges closely together, taking care to pro- 
vide holes in the center for the escape of the air. Pies from black* 
berries, raspberries, etc., are all made in the same way, regulating 
the quantity of the sugar by the tartness of the fruit. 

Lemon Pie. 
One lemon grated, one cup sugar, the yolks of three eggs, small 
pieces butter, three table-spoons milk, two tea-spoons com starch ; 
beat all together and bake in a rich crust; beat the whites with 
three table-spoons sugar, place on the pie when done, and then 
brown in the oven. — Mrs. W. E. Scobey, 

Lemon Pie. 
Four eggs, one and a half cups sugar, two-thirds cups water, two 
table-spoons flour, one lemon. Beat the yolks of eggs until very 
smooth (beat the yolks a long time and whip the whites well), add 
the grated peel of lemon and the sugar, beat well, stir in the flour, 
and add the lemon juice (if lemons are small two may be necessary), 
and lastly the water; stir well, and pour in pie-pans lined with 
paste. When baked, take from oven, and spread over them the 
whites of the eggs beaten dry and smooth with four table-spoons 
pulverized sugar ; return to oven and brown slightly. The above 
recipe is for two pies. — Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith. 

Appleless Mince-Meat. 
Chop fine eight pounds green tomatoes, add six pounds sugar, one 
ounce each of cloves, cinnamon and allspice, simmer slowly till 
tomatoes are clear, then put away in a covered jar. For pies in 
winter, take in the proportion of two-thirds tomatoes and one-third 
meat, and season with butter, boiled cider, sugar if needed, etc.. ai 
regular mince pies would be seasoned.

Mince-Meat. 

Take five or six pounds scraggy beef — a neck piece will do — and 
put to boil in water enough to cover it; take off the scum that 
rises when it reaches the boUing point, add hot water irom time to 
time until it is tender, then remove the lid from the pot, salt, let 
boil till almost dry, turning the meat over occasionally in the liquor, 
take from the fire, and let stand over night to get thoroughly cold ; 
pick bones, gristle, or stringy bits from the meat, chop very fine, 
mincing at the same time three pounds of nice beef suet ; seed and 
cut four pounds raisins, wash and dry four pounds currants, slice 
thin a pound of citron, chop fine four quarts good-cooking tart ap- 
ples; put into a large pan together, add two ounces cinnamon, one 
of cloves, one of giiiger, four nutmegs, the juice and grated rhids 
of two lemons, one table-spoon salt, oue tea-spoon pepper, and two 
pounds sugar. Put in a porcelain kettle one quart boiled cider, or, 
better still, one quart currant or gmpe juice (canned when grapes 
are turning from green to purple), one quart nice molasses or syrup, 
and, if you have any syrup left from sweet pickles, add some of 
that, also a good lump of butter ; let it come to boiling point, and 
pour over the ingredients in the pan after having first mixed them 
well, then mix again thoroughly. Pack in jars and put in a cool 
place, and, when cold, pour molasses over the top an eighth of an 
inch in thickness, and cover tightly. This will keep two months. 
For baking, take some out of a jar, if not moist enough add a little 
hot water, and strew a few whole raisins over each pie. Instead of 
boiled beef, a beef Vheart or roast meat may be used ; and a good 
proportion for a few pies is one-third chopped meat and two-thirds 
apples, with a little suet, raisins, spices, butter, and salt. 

The above is a good formula to use, but, of course, may be varied 
to suit diflTerent tastes or the material at hand. If too rich, add 
more chopped apples ; in lieu of cider, vinegar and water in equal 
proportions may be used ; good preserves, marmalades, spiced 
pickles, currant or grape jelly, canned fruit, dried cherries, etc., 
may take the place of raisins, currants and citrons. Wine or 
brandy is considered by many a great improvement, but if " it 
causeth thy brother to offend " do not use it. Lemon and vanilla 
extracts are often used, also preserved lemon or orange peel. The 



220 PASTRY. 

minoe-meat is better to stand over night, or several days, before 
baking into pies, as the materials will be more thoroughly incorpo- 
rated. Many prefer to freeze their pies after baking, heating them as 

needed. 

Mince-Meat. 

Two bowls chopped apples, one of chopped meat, with one-fourth 
pound suet, grated rind and juice of one lemon, two tea-cups mo*

Bina's Strawberry Shortcake. 
Two heaping tea-spoons baking powder sifted into one quart flour, 
Bcant half tea-cup butter, two table-spoons sugar, a little salt, 
oiough sweet milk (or water) to make a sofl dough ; roll out almost 
88 thin as pie-crust, place one layer in a baking-pan, and spread 
with a very little butter, upon which sprinkle some flour, then add 
another layer of crust and spread as before, and so on until crust is 
all used. This makes four layei*s in a pan fourteen inches by seven. 
Bake about fifteen minutes in a quick oven, turn out upside down, 
take ofi* the top layer (the bottom when baking), place on a dish, 
spiesid plentifully with strawberries (not mashed) previously sweet- 
ened with pulverized sugar, place layer upon layer, treating each 
one in the same way ; and when done you will have a handsome 
cake, to be served warm with sugar and cream. The secret of 
having light dough is to handle it as little and mix it as quickly as 
possible. Shortcake is delicious served with charlotte-russe or 
whipped cream. Easpberry and peach shortcakes may be made in 

the same way. 

Orange Shortcake. 

One quart flour, two table-spoons butter, two tea-spoons baking 
powder thoroughly mixed with the flour ; mix (not very stifi*) with 
cold water, work as little as possible, bake, split open, and lay 
sliced oranges between ; cut in squares and serve with pudding 
sauce. Berries may be used instead of oranges. — Mr8. Canby, BeUe-

Apple Tarts. 

Pare, quarter, core, and boil in a half tea-cup of water until very 
soft, ten large tart apples ; beat till very smooth, then add the yolks 
of six eggs or three whole eggs, juice and grated rind of two lemons, 
half cup butter, one and a half cups sugar, or more if not sweet 
enough; beat all thoroughly, line little tart-tins with puff*-paste, 
and fill with the mixture, bake five minutes in a hot oven. If 
wanted very nice, take the whites of the six eggs (when the yolks 
of six are used), mix with six table-spoons pulverized sugar, spread 
on the top of the tarts, return to oven and brown slightly. 

For almond tarts, beat to a cream the yolks of three eggs and a

minutes, and when cold, add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs 
and the white of one ; beat all well together, and pour into pattj* 
pans lined with a rich crust ; bake a few minutes. 

When removed from oven, cover the tarts with a meringue made 
01 the whites of the three eggs, mixed with three table-spoons sugar ; 
return to oven, and brown delicately. ' 

Tart Shells. 

Roll out thin a nice puff-paste, cut out with a glass or biscuit 
cutter, with a wine-glass or smaller cup cut out the center of two 
out of three of these, lay the rings thus made on the third, and 
bake immediately ; or shells may be made by lining patty-pans with 
paste. If the paste is light, the shells will be fine, and may be 
used for tarts or oyster patties. Filled with jelly and covered with 
meringue (table-spoon sugar to white of one egg), and browned in 
oven, they are very nice to serve for tea. 

A Kentucky Girl's Pumpkin Pie. 

Gut pumpkin in halves, remove seeds, bake in a dripping-pan 
(skin side of pumpkin downward), with a aUno fire, until pulp can 
readily be scraped from skin ; mash fine, and while hot add to each 
quart pumpkin two table-spoons butter; when cold, sweeten to 
taste ; add one pint cream or new milk, yolks of three eggs, well 
beaten and strained^ cinnamon and allspice to taste (ginger, if pre- 
ferred), one wine-glass of brandy; stir weU, and just at the last 
add whites of eggs, well whipped. The brandy can be omitted 
and not injure recipe. Many like a table-spoon of lemon extract 
and less spice. If lemon is used, omit brandy. Bake in deep pie- 
plates in a quick oven. — L. A* B. (X, LexmgUm, Ky. 



PUDDINGS AND SAUCES. 



No ingredient of doubtful quality should enter into the composi- 
tion of puddings. Suet must be 'perfecdy Sfweet^ and milk should be 
firesh and without the least unpleasant flavor. Suet when over kept 
and milk soured or curdled in the slightest degree, ruins a pudding 
which would otherwise be most delicious. Dried currants, such as 
are sold in the market, need very careful and thorough washing 
(after which they must be dried in a napkin), and raisins should be 
rubbed in a coarse towel to remove stems and all dirt from the out- 
aide, and afterward carefully seeded. Almonds and spices must be 
very finely pounded, and the rinds of oranges or lemons rasped or 
grated lighUy off (the white part of the peel has no flavor and is an 
mjury). 

In making puddings, always beat the eggs separately, straining 
the yolks and adding the whites the last thing. If boiled milk is 
used, let it cool somewhat before adding the eggs; when fruit is 
added, stir it in at the last. Puddings are either baked, boiled or 
steamed; rice, bread, custard, and fruit puddings require a mod- 
erate heat; batter and com starch, a rather quick oven. Always 
bake them as soon as mixed. Add a pinch of salt to any pud- 
dmg. 

Boiled puddings are lighter when boiled in a cloth and allowed 
full room to swell, but many use either a tin mold or bowl with 
cloth tied over it ; grease the former well on the inside with lard or 
butter, and in boiling do not let the water reach quite to the top. 
The pudding-bag should be made of firm drilling, tapering from 
top to bottom, and rounded on the comers; stitch and fell the 

15 (226) 



226 PUDDINGS AND 8A UCES. 

Beams, which should be outside when in use, and sew a tape to flie 
seam, about three inches ^m top. Wring the bag out of hot 
water, flour the inside well, pour in the pudding (which should be 
well beaten the instant before pouring), tie securely, leaving room 
to swell (especially when made of Indian meal, bread, rice, or 
crackers), and place in a kettle with a saucer at the bottom to pre* 
vent burning; immediately pour in enough boiling water to entireljr 
cover the bag, which must be turned several times, keeping it boiling 
constantly, filling up from the tea-kettle when needed. If the pud* 
ding is boiled in a bowl, grease, fill, and cover with a square of 
drilling wrung out of hot water, floured and tied on. To use a pan, 
tie a cloth tightly over the rim, bringing the ends back together, 
and pinning them over the top of the pan ; the puddipg may then 
be lifted out easily by a strong fork put through the ends or cor- 
ners of the cloth. Open bag a little to I6t steam escape, and serve 
immediately, as delay ruins all boiled pudding. For plum pud- 
dings, invert the pan when put in the kettle, and the pudding will 
not become water-soaked. When the pudding is done, give what- 
ever it is boiled in a quick plunge into cold water, and turn out at 
once, serving immediately. As a general rule, boiled puddings re- 
quire double the time required for baked. Steaming is safer than 
either boiling or baking, as the pudding is sure to be light and 
wholesome. Put on over cold water and do not remove cover while 
steaming. In making sauces, do not boil after the butter is added. 
Use brown or powdered sugar for sauces. In place of wine or 
brandy, flavor with juice of the grape, or any other fruit prepared 
for this purpose in its season by boiling and bottling and sealing 
while hot. Pudding cloths, however coarse, should never be 
washed with soap, but in clear, clean water, dried as quickly as 
j> >ssible, and kept dry and out of dust in a drawer or cupboard 
free from smell. Dates are an excellent substitute for sugar in 
Graham or any other pudding. Fruit for preserving should 
always be gathered in perfectly dry weather and be free from dust 
and the morning and evening dew. Never use tin, iron or pevrter 
spoons or skimmers for preserves.

Rapids, la. 



PRESERVES. 



Preserves, to be perfect, must be made with the greatest care. 
Economy of time and trouble is a waste of fruit and sugar. The 
best are made by putting only a small amount of fruit at a time 
in the syrup, after the latter has been carefully prepared and clar- 
ified, and the fruit neatly pared. Peel peaches, pears, quinces and 
apples, and throw into cold water as you peel them to prevent their 
turning dark. It is difficult to watch a large quantity so as to 
insure its being done to a turn. 

The old rule is ** a pouud of sugar to pound of fruit; " but since 
the introduction of cans, three-quarters of a pouud of sugar to a 
pound of fruit is sufficient, and even less is sometimes used, the 
necessity for an excess of sugar having passed away, as preserves 
may be less sweet, with no risk of fermentation, if sealed. Either 
tin or glass cans may be used, care being taken to make the sealing 
perfect. 

Quinces, pears, citrons, watermelon-rinds, and many of the smaller 
fi^ts, such as cherries, currants, etc., harden when put, at first, 
wto a syrup made of their weight of sugar. To prevent this they 
should be cooked till tender in water, or in a weak syrup made 
from a portion only of the sugar, adding the remainder afterward. 
In preserving fruits, such as apples, peaches, tomatoes, plums and 
strawberries, and other fruits, which are likely to become too soft in 
cooking, it is a good plan to pour the hot syrup over the fruit, or to 
^^^ over it a part or all the sugar, and aUow it to stand a few 
bouTB; by either method the juice is extracted, and the fruit hard« 



244 PRESERVES. 

ened. Another approved method of hardening fruit is to skim it 
out of syrup after cooking a few minutes, and lay it in the hot sun 
two or three hours, and then pour over it the boiling syrup. Long 
protracted boiling destroys the pleasant natural flavor of the ^rulty 
and darkens it 

Preserves should boil gently to avoid the danger of burning, and 
in order that the sugar may thoroughly penetrate the fruit A good 
syrup is made iu the proportion of half pint water to a pound of 
sugar. Use loaf or granulated sugar. Put the sugar and water 
over the fire in a porcelain kettle, and, just before it boils, stir in 
the white of an egg beaten lightly with two table-spoons water ; and, 
as it begins to boil, remove the scum with great care ; boil until no 
more scum arises, and then add fruit Or the white of the egg 
may be mixed thoroughly with the dry sugar in the kettle, and the 
boiling water poured over, when all impurities will immediately rise 
to the surface with the egg, then boil slowly, or rather simmer, until 
the preserves are clear. Take out each piece with a skimmer and 
lay on a flat dish to cool, or else put in the jars at once. Stew the 
syrup, skimming ofl* the scum which rises, until it *' ropes'* from the 
spoon. If the preserves are already in the jar pour the syrup over 
them and seal ; if on dishes, return them to the syrup and boil up 
once before putting up. This is merely a matter of choice, and we 
have never found any difl*erence in the results of the two methods. 
Preserves may be made from canned fruit (and some prefer to do 
this rather than* make in the hot season), using less sugar than the 
rule. When preserving canned peaches or apples, it is an improve- 
ment to add a few sliced oranges or lemons. When berries or small 
fruits are done, take up with a little strainer, and place in cans; 
if a cup is used, it is impossible to free them from the syrup. 

Marmalades, or the diflerent butters, will be smoother and bettei 
flavored, and will require less boiling, if the fruit (peaches, quinces, 
oranges and apples make the best) li well cooked and mashed before 
adding either sugar or cider. I£ Is important to stir constantly with 
an apple-butter stirrer. 

In making either preserves or marwlades, follow the directions 
as regards kettle, sugar, and putting uj^, already g^ven for jellies 
and jamsy covering at once, but not putting away tiU cold. When 



PRESER VES, 245 

preeerves are candied, set jar in kettle of cold water, and let 
boil for an hour ; or pat them in a crock kept for that purpose, 
set in oven and boil a few minutes, watching carefully to pre- 
vent burning. When specks of mold appear, take them off 
carefully, and scald preserves as above directed. 

Dried iruits are much better and require less boiling, if clean soft 
water is poured over them and allowed to stand over night. In the 
morning boil until tender in the water, sweetening five minutes 
before removing from the stove. 

To dry corn or fruits nicely, spread in shallow boxes or box cov- 
ers, and cover with mosquito netting to prevent flies reaching them. 
When dry, put up in jura and cover closely, or in paper sacks. 
Dried peaches are better when halved and the cavities sprinkled 
with" sugar in drying. The fruit must be good, however, as poor 
firuit can not be redeemed by any process. Another excellent way 
is to dry them in the oven, and, when about half done, place in a 
crock a layer of peaches alternately with a layer of sugar. Cherries 
and currants are excellent dried ds follows: Put in jars first a layer 
of fruit, then a layer of sugar, in the proportion of half a pound 
sugar to pound of fruit, let stand over night, place them to boil, 
skimming off aU scum, let boil ten or fifteen minutes, skim out and 
spread on dishes to dry in the sun, or by the fire, turning frequently 
nntil dry ; then place on pans in oven, stirring with the hand often 
until the heat is too great to bear. They may then be packed in 
jars with sugar, or put away in paper sacks, or stone crocks with a 
cloth tied dose over the top, and are an excellent substitute for 
raisins in puddings or mince-pies. 

The secret of keeping dried fruit is to exdvde the light, and to keep 
in a dry and cool place. Paper sacks, or a barrel or box lined with 
paper, are secure against moths. Eeheating fruit makes it dark in 
color, and impairs its flavor. Always fill a fruit-can, and keep for 
present use, to avoid opening the large jars often. 



ApfLE Preserves. 

Take threeHjuarters of^ pound sugar to each pound apples; mftke 
A syrup of the sugar and water in which root ginger (bruised and 



246 PEESERVES. 

tied ID a bag) has been boiled until the strength is well extracted, 
add a little lemon-juice or sliced lemon, ski in off all scum, and boil 
in the syrup a few apples at a time, until they are transparent, and 
place in jar. When all are done, boil the syrup until thick, pour, 
boiling hot, over the apples, and cover closely. Well-flavored fruit, 
not easily broken in cooking, should be used. The ginger may be 
omitted if disliked. 

Carrot Sweetmeats. 

Boil small fine-grained carrots in water till tender ; peel and grate, 
add sugar, slips of citron, spices if preferred, and wine ; simmer 
slowly together and put away in jars. Very wholesome for chil- 
dren and very much liked. The juice from any canned fruit sold 
would take the place of the simple wine used here — the alcoholic 
mixtures sold in America being utterly unfit for household con- 
sumption. — Mrs. S. Willifston, Heidelberg, Germany. 

CHERRY Preserves. 
Choose sour ones — the early Richmond is good — seed all very 
carefully, allow an amount of sugar equal to the fruit; take half 
the sugar, sprinkle over the fruit, let stand about an hour, pour into 
a preserving-kettle, boil slowly ten minutes, skim out the cherries, 
add rest of sugar to the syrup, boil, skim and pour over the cher- 
ries ; the next day drain ofi* the syrup, boil, skim if necessary, add 
the cherria«(, boil twenty minutes, and seal up in small jars. — Mrs. 

J. M, Southard. 

Citron Preserves. 

Pare off rind, seed, cut in thin slices two inches long, weigh, and 

put in preserving kettle with water enough to cover ; boil one hour, 

take out the melon, and to the water in kettle add as much sugar 

as there is melon by weight, boil until quite thick, replace melon, 

add two sliced lemons to each pound of fruit, boil twenty minutes, 

take out, boil syrup until it is very thick molasses, and pour it over 

the fruit. — Mrs, J. H: Rcbvnson, 

Fig Preserves. 
Gather fruit when fully ripe, but not cracked open ; place in a 
prorated tin bucket or wire basket, and dip for a moment into a 
deep kettle of hot and moderately strong lye (some prefer letting 



PRESERVES. 247 

them lie an hour in lime-water and afterwards drain) ; make a syrup 
in proportion of one pound sugar to one of fruit, and when the figs 
are well drained, put them in syrup and boil until well cooked ; 
remove, boil syrup down until there is just enough to cover firuit ; 
put firuit back in syrup, let all boil, and seal up while hot in glass 
or porcelain jars. — Ed-Oov. Steams^ Florida. 

Grape Preserves. 
Pick grapes from the stems, pop pulps from the skins, doing U\ * 
at a time, one in each hand between the thumb and forefinger. Put 
pulp in a porcelain kettle and stew gently untU the seeds are loosen- 
ed; then strain and rub it through a sieve, weigh it with the skins, 
and to every pound of this allow one pound of granulated sugar. 
Put skins and juice in kettle, cover closely, and cook slowly until 
the skins are tender ; while still boiling add the sugar, and move the 
kettie back, as it must not boil again ; keep very hot for fifteen 
minutes, then, seeing that the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, pour 
the fruit in cans, and screw down the covers as soon as possible. 

Pear Preserves. 
Pare, cut in halves, core and weigh (if hard, boil in water until 
tender, and use the water for the syrup), allow three-quarters 
pound sugar for each pound fruit, boU a few moments, skim, and 
cool ; when luke-warm add pears, and boil gently until syrup has 
penetrated them and they look clear ; some of the pieces will cook 
before the rest, and must be removed ; when done, take out, boil 
down syrup a little and pour over them ; a few cloves stuck here 
and there in the pears add a pleasant flavor. Put in small jars 
with glass or tin tops, and seal with putty. — Mm Florence WiUiams. 

Peach Preserves. 
Take any fine peaches that do not mash readily in cooking, pare 
carefiilly and remove pits; take sugar equal in weight to fruit, 
(or if to be sealed, three-quarters pound sugar to the pound of fruit), 
and water in proportion of a half pint to each pound of sugar. 
Boil pits in the water, adding more as it evaporates, to keep the 
proportion good, remove pits, add the sugar, clarify, and when the 
scum ceases to rise, add the fruit, a small quantity at a time ; Qpok 
slowly about ten minutes, skim out into a jar, add more, and so on 



248 PRESERVES. 

until all are done, and then pour the boiling syrup over all. The 
next day drain off and boil syrup a few minutes only, and pour back, 
repeating daily until the fruit looks clear. Two or three times ia 
generally sufficient The last time put up the preserves in small jars, 
and secure with paper as directed for jellies. K to be sealed in cans, 
the first boiling is sufficient, af\er which put into cans and seal im- 
mediately. The latter plan is preferable, as it takes less trouble 
and less sugar, while the natural flavor of the fruit is better re* 
tained. Many think peach preserves much nicer if made with 
maple sugar. Clingstone peaches are preserved in the same way 
whole, except that they must be put on in clear water and boiled 
until so tender that they may be pierced with a silver fork before 

adding the sugar. 

Plum Preserves. 

Allow equal weights sugar and plums ; add sufficient water to 

the sugar to make a thick syrup, boil, skim, and pour over the 

plums (previously washed, pricked and placed in a stone jar), and 

cover with a plate. The next day drain off syrup, boil, skim, and 

pour in over plums ; repeat this for three or four days, place pluma 

and syrup in the preserving-kettle, and boil very slowly for half an 

hour. Put up in stone jars, c>over with papers like jellies, or seal 

in cans. — Mn, J, JET. Shearer, 

Plum Sweetmeats. 

When Damson plums are perfectly ripe, peel and divide them, 
taking out the stones ; put them over a gentle heat to cook in their 
own juice ; when soft rub them through a sieve, and return to 
the stove, adding just enough sugar to sweeten, a little cinnamon, 
and, when nearly done, wine in quantity to suit the taste. This is 
done more to keep the sweetmeats than for the flavor, as self-sealing 
cans are not used here, and all preserves are pasted up with the 
white of eggs. The common wine of the country is thin and sour 
and is much used in cookery. — Mrs, L. S, WiUiston, Heiddberg^ 
Oermany. 

Quince and Apple Preserves. 

Take equal weights of quinces and sugar, pare, core, leave whole 
or<;ut up, as preferred, boil till tender in water enough to cover, 
carefully take out and put on a platter, add sugar to the water, 



PRESERVES. 249 

replace finiit and boQ slowly till clear, place in jars and pour syrup 
over them. To increase the quantity without adding sugar, take 
half or two-ihirds in weight as many fair sweet apples as there are 
quinces, pore, quarter, and core ; after removing quinces, put apples 
into the syrup, and boil until they begin to look red and clear, and 
are tender; place quinces and apples in jar in alternate layers, and 
cover with syrup. For the use of parings and cores, see " Quince 
Jelly." Apples alone may be preserved in the same way. 

Strawbekry Preserves. 
Put two pounds of sugar in a bright tin-pan over a kettle of 
boiling water, and pour into it half a pint of boiling water; when 
the sugar is dissolved and hot, put in fruit, and then place the pan 
directly on the stove or range ; let boil ten minutes or longer if the 
fruit is not clear, gently (or the berries will be broken) take up with 
a small strainer, and keep hot while the syrup is boiled down until 
thick and rich; drain off the thin syrup from the cans, and pour 
the rich syrup over the berries to fill, and screw down the tops im« 
mediately. The thin syrup poured off may be brought to boiling, 
and then bottled and sealed, to be used for sauces and drinks. 

Tomato Preserves. 
Scald and peel carefully small perfectly-formed tomatoes, not 
too ripe (yellow pear-shaped are best), prick with a needle to pre- 
vent bursting, add an equal amount of sugar by weight, let lie over 
night, then pour off all juice into a preserving-kettle, and boil until 
it is a thick syrup, clarifying with white of an egg ; add tomatoes 
and boil carefnlly until they look transparent. A piece or two of 
root-gingev, or one lemon to a pound of fruit sliced thin and cooked 
with the fruit, may be added. 

Watermelon Preserves. 
Pare off outside green rind, cut in pieces two inches long, weigh, 
throw into cold water, skim out, add a heaping tea-spoon each of 
salt and pulverized aluin to two gallons of rinds, let stand until salt 
and alum dissolve, fill the kettle with cold water, and place on top 
of stove where it will slowly come to boiling point, covering with a 
l&rge plate so as to keep rinds under ; boil until they can be easily 
pierced with a fork, drain them from the water, and put into a syrup 



250 PRESERVES, 

previoualy prepared as follows : Bruise and tie in a muslin bag feur 
ounces of ginger-root, and boil in two or three pints of water until 
it is strongly flavored. At the same time boil in a little water 
until tender, in another pan, three or four sliced lemons ; make a 
syrup of the sugar and the water in which the lemons and the gin- 
ger-root were boiled, add the rinds and slices of lemon to this and 
boil slowly half to three-quarters of an hour. Citrons may be pre- 
ixired in the same way, by paring, coring and slicing, or cutting 
into fanciful shapes with tin cuttera made for the purpose. 

Apple Butter. 
Boil one barrel of new cider down half, peel and core three 
bushels of good cooking apples ; when the cider has boiled to half 
the quantity, add the apples, and when soft, stir constantly for 
from eight to ten hours. If done it will adhere to an inverted 
plate. Put away in stone jars (not earthen ware), covering first 
with writing-paper cut to fit the jar, and press down closely upon 
the apple butter ; cover the whole with thick brown paper snugly 
tied down. — Mm SaraJi Tlumison, Delaware, 

Egg Butter. 
Boil a pint of molasses slowly about fifleen or twenty minutes, 
stirring to prevent burning, add three eggs well beaten, stirring 
them in as fast as possible, boil a few minutes longer, partially cool, 
and flavor to taste with lemon. — Mrs. Colbert, Broadway. 

Lemon Butter. 
Tea-cup white sugar, three eggs, butter the size of half an egg, 
beat well together; add juice and grated rind of one large lemon, 
place in a pan set in a kettle of hot water, stir well until thick. 
This may be made up in quantity, kept for a long time in bottles 
or jars, and used as needed for filling tarts, etc. 

PuMPkm Butter. 
Take tlie seeds out of one pumpkin, cut in small pieces and boil 
eofl ; take three other pumpkins, cut them in pieces and boil them 
soft, put them in a coarse bag and press out juice; add juice to 
first pumpkin, and let boil ten hours or more, to become of the 
thickness of butter ; stir often. If the pumpkms are frozen, the 
juice will come out much easier. 



PRESERVES. ' 251 

Pie-plant Butter. 
Allow one pound of sugar to each pound of peeled and cut up 
rhubarb ; let the rhubarb and sugar simmer gently for an hour, or 
more if the rhubarb is old and tough. This is a nice preserve, and 
children should be encouraged to eat it during the winter. 

Obange Mabmalade. 
Twelve pounds sour oranges, twelve pounds crushed sugar ; wash 
the oranges and pare them as you would apples ; put the peel in a 
porcelain-lined kettle with twice its bulk or more of cold water; 
keep it covered, and boil until perfectly tender; if the water boila 
away, add more; the peel is generally very hard, and requires 
several hours boiling ; cut the oranges in two crosswise, and squeeze 
out tlie juice and the soft pulp, have a pitcher with a strainer in the 
top, place in a two-quart bowl-, squeeze the thin juice and seeds in 
the strainer and th^ rest with the pulp in the bowl, drawing the 
skin as you squeeze it over the edge of the tin strainer, to scrape off 
the pulp, then pour all the juice and pulp on the sugar ; the white 
Bkins must be covered with three quarts of cold water, and boiled 
half an hour, drain the water on the sugar, put the white skins in 
the colander, four or five together, and pound off the soft part, of 
which there must be in all two pounds and four ounces, put this with 
the sugar and juice ; when the peel is tender drain it from the water, 
ftiid choose either of these three modes : Pound it in a mortar, chop 
it in a bowl, or cut it in delicate shreds with a pair of scissors. There 
is still another way, which saves the necessity of handling the peel 
after it is boiled ; it is to grate the yellow rind from the orange, then 
tie it ill a muslin bag, and boil until soft, which you can tell by 
rubbing a little of it between the thumb and finger ; it is then ready 
for the other ingredients ; put the whole in a porcelain kettle, or in 
a bright tin preserving-pan, and boil about an hour; when it begins 
to thicken it must l)e tried occasionally, by letting a little cool in a 
spoon laid on ice. To prevent its burning, pass the spoon often over 
the bottom of the kettle ; when it is thick as desired put it in tum- 
blers and cover with paper. — Mrs, Elizaheih S. MUler in "In the 

Peach Marmalade.

serves, reserving for marmalade those that are too soft. The flavor 
is improved by first boiling the pits in the water with which the 
syrup is to be made. Quarter the peaches and boil thirty minutes 
before adding sugar, stirring almost constantly from the time the 
peaches begin to be tender; add sugar in the proportion of three- 
fourths pound sugar to one pound fruit, continue to boil and stir 
for an hour longer, and put up in jars, pressing paper over them as 

directed for jellies. 

Quince Mabmalade. 

Pare, quarter and core quinces, cut in little squares, measure 
and allow an equal amount of sugar ; place the fruit in a porcelain 
kettle with just water enough to cover, boil till tender, and skim 
out carefully ; make a syrup of the sugar and the water in which 
the quinces were boiled, let come te boiling point, skim well, and 
drop the quinces gently in ; boil fifteen minutes and dip out care- 
fully into jelly-bowls or molds. The syrup forms a jelly around 
the fruit so that it can be turned out on a dish, and is very palat- 
able as well as ornamental. In this way quinces too defective for 
preserves may be used. — Mrs, Mary A, Cooper, 

Dried Apple Sauce. 
Look over, wash thoroughly and soak fifteen minutes in clean 

warm water ; drain, cover with cold soft water, place on the stove, 
let boil slowly two to four hours, mash fine, sweeten, and season 
with cinnamon very highly. Never add sugar until about five min- 
utes before removing from the stove, otherwise the fruit will be tough- 
ened and hardened. Follow the same directions in preparing dried 
peaches, only do not mash or season so highly. Cook in porcelain, 
without stirring. A few raisins added improve the apple sauce. 

Boiled Cider Apple Sauce. 
Pare, quarter and core applas sufiicient to fill a gallon porcelain 

kettle, put in it a half gallon boiled cider, let it boil. Wash the 

apples and put in kettle, place a plate over them, and boil steadily 

but not rapidly until they are thoroughly cooked, testing by taking 

one from under the edge of the plate with a fork. Do not remove 

the plate until done, or the apples will sink to the bottom and 

burn. Apples may be cooked in sweet cider in the same way.— 

Mrs. W. W. W. 



PRESERVES. 253 

Preserved Citron. 

Boil the citron in water until it is clear and soft enough to be 
easily pierced with a fork ; take out, put into a nice syrup of sugar 
and water, and boil until the sugar has penetrated it. Take out 
and spread on dishes to dry slowly, sprinkling several times with 
powdered sugar, and turning until it is dried enough. Pack in 
jars or boxes with sugar between the layers. — Mrs, I. N. Beem, 
Bourion 0>., Ky. 

Tomato Figs. 

Scald and skin pear-shaped (or any small-sized) tomatoes, and to 
eight pounds of them add three pounds brown sugar ; cook without 
water until the sugar penetrates and they have a clear appearance, 
take out, spread on dishes, and dry in the sun, sprinkling on a little 
syrup while drying ; pack in jars or boxes, in layers with powdered 
sugar between. Thus put up they will keep for any length of time, 
and are nearly equal to figs. Peaches may be preserved in the 
same way. — Mrs. John Samuels, Covington, Ky. 

Dried Currants (or Conserve). 

One pint sugar to a pint of stemmed ripe currants ; put them 
together in a porcelain kettle, a layer of currants at the bottom; 
^\iea the sugar is dissolved, let them boil one or two minutes, skim 
from the syrup, and spread on plates to dry in a partly cooled oven. 
Boil the syrup until thickened, pour it over the currants, and dry 
it with them. Pack in jars and cover closely. Blackberries may 
he dried in the same manner. An economical way of making jelly 
is to boil liquid, skimming well, after currants are taken out, until 
it becomes jelly, and then put away in jelly glasses. — Mrs. H. A., Va. 

Pine-apple Preserves. 

Wash fruit, and boil without paring until tender; take out, pare 
•nd dice lengthwise, leaving out the hard center. Pour a syrup 
(using a pound of sugar to one of fruit), boiling hot, over pine- 
apples, and let stand until the next morning. Pour off syrup^ 
^il until nearly thick enough, then add fruit, and boil fifteen or 
^wienty minutes. 



PICKLES. 



In making pickles use none but the best cider vinegar, and boil 
in a porcelain kettle — ^never in metal. A lump of alum size of a 
small nutmeg, to a gallon of cucumbers, dissolved and added to the 
vinegar when scalding the pickles the first time, renders them crisp 
and tender, but too much is injurious. Keep in a dry, cool cellar, 
in glass or stoneware ; look at them frequently and remove all soft 
ones ; if white specks appear in the vinegar, drain off and scald, 
adding a liberal handful of sugar to each gallon, and pour again 
over the pickles ; bits of horee-radish and a few cloves assist in pre* 
serving the life of the vinegar. If put away in large stone jars, 
invert a saucer over the top of the pickles, so as to keep them well 
under the vinegar. The nicest way to put up pickles is bottling, 
sealing while hot, and keeping in a cool, dark place. Many 
think that mustard-seed improves pickles, especially chopped, 
bottled, and mangoes, but use it, as well as horse-radish and 
cloves, sparingly. Never put up pickles in any thing that 
has held any kind of grease, and never let them freeze. Use 
an oaken tub or cask for pickles in brine, keep them well under, and 
have more salt than will dissolve, so that there will always be plenty 
at the bottom of the cask. The brine for pickles should be strong 
enough to bear an egg ; make it in the proportion of a heaping pint 
of coarse salt to a gallon of water. Use coarse salt, and test pickles 
by tasting before putting on vinegar (they should be of a pleasant 
saltness) ; if not salt enough, add salt to brine and allow them to 
stand until they have acquired the proper flavor ; if too salt, cover 
with weak vinegar, and let stand for two or three days, drain, add- 
ing strong vinegar, cither hot or cold according to recipes, and finish 
as directed. In the case of kegs of cucumbers kept in brine for 
a long time, to be used when needed, it is better to err in using too 
much salt, as this may be corrected by adding the weak vinegar, 
but if not sufficiently salted the pickles will be insipid. In scalding

PICKLES, 255 

eacmnber pickles to green them, some use cabbage leaves, covering 
bottom, sides, and top of kettle. A medium spicing for a quart of 
pickles is a level tea-spoon of peppercorns (whole black peppers), 
the same of allspice, a table-spoon of broken stick cinnamon, half a 
tearspoon of cloves, mustard seed, or horse-radish chopped fine, and 
one piece of ginger root, an inch long. If ground cayenne pepper 
is used instead of whole peppers, an eighth of a tea-spoon is enough. 
A better substitute for peppercorns is garden-peppers cut in rings, 
in proportion of two rings of green and one of red wfthout seeds, or 
a level tea-spoon, when finely chopped, to a quart of pickles. These 
proportions may be increased or decreased to suit the taste, taking 
care not to put in so much of any one as to make its flavor pre- 
dominate. Ginger is the most wholesome of the spices. Cloves are 
the strongest, mace next, then allspice and cinnamon, and, of course, 
less of the stronger should be used. Pickles are not famous for 
wholesome qualities, even when made with the greatest care, but if 
they must be eaten, it is best to make them at home. Those sold 
in market are often colored a beautiful green with sulphate of cop- 
per, which is a deadly poison, or are cooked ih brass or copper ves- 
sels, which produces the same result in an hidirect w^ay. Scalding 
or parboiling articles to be pickled makes them absorb the vinegar 
more easily, but does not add to their crij*pness. Before putting 
ihem in vinegar, after parboiling, they should be cold and 'perfectly 
Jry. Always use strong vinegar, or the pickles will be insipid, and 
it should be scalding hot when poured on, as raw vinegar becomes 
ropy and does not keep well. As heating weakens it, vinegar for 
pickles should be very strong^ and should only be brought to boiling 
^mt, and immediately poured on pickles. Keep pickles from the 
&ir, and see that the vinegar is at least two inches over the top of 
pickles in the jar. A dry wooden spoon or ladle should be used in 
lumdling pickles, and is the only one that should touch pickles in the 
jars. If the vinegar loses its strength it should be replaced by good, 
poured over scalding hot. 

Pickled Artichokes. 
Rub off outer skin with a coarse towel, and lav in salt water for 
A clay, drain and pour over them cold spiced vinegar, adding a tea- 
spoonful of horw-radish to each jar. 



256 PICKLES. 

Bean Pickles. 

Pick green beaus of the best variety, wlien young and tender, 
string, and place in a kettle to boil, with salt to taste, until they 
can be pierced with a fork, drain well through a colander, put in a 
stone jar, sprinkle with cayenne pepper, and cover with strong cider 
vinegar; sugar may be added if desired. 

Bottled Pickles. 

' Wash and wipe a half bushel of medium-sized cucumbers, suit- 
able for pickling, pack close in a stone jar, sprinkle over the top one 
pint of salt, pour over a sufficient quantity of boiling water to cover 
them, place a cloth over the jar, and let stand until cold (if pre- 
pared in the evening, let stand all night), drain off the water, and 
place the pickles on stove in cold vinegar, let them come to a boil, 
take out, place in a stone jar, and cover with either cold or hot 
vinegar. They will be ready for use in a few days, and are excel- 
lent It is an improvement to add a few spices and a small quan- 
tity of sugar. 

To bottle th6m, prepare with salt and boiling water as above, 
drain (when cold), and .place a gallon at a time on a stove in enough 
cold vmegar to cover level (need not be very strong), to which a 
lump of alum about the size of a small hickory-nut (too much is 
injurious) has been added. Have on stove, in another kettle, a 
gallon of the very best cider vinegar, to which add half* a pint of 
brown sugar ; have bottles cleansed and placed to heat on stove in 
a large tin-pan of cold water; also have a tin cup or small pan 
of sealing-wax heated ; on table, have spices prepared in separate 
dishes, as follows: Green and red peppers sliced in rings; horse- 
radish roots washed, scraped, and cut in small pieces, black and 
yellow mustard seed (or this may be left out), each prepared by 
sprinkling with salt and pouring on some boiling water, which let 
stand fifteen minutes and then draw off; stick cinnamon washed free 
from dust, and broken in pieces, and a few cloves. When pickles 
come to boiling point, take out and pack in bottles, mixing with them 
the spices (use the cloves, horse-radish and mustard seed, sparingly); 
put in a layer of pickles, then a layer of spices, shaking the bot- 
tles occasionally so as to pack tightly ; when Aill cover with the

boQing hot yinegar from the other kettle (using a bright ftmnel and 
bright tin cup), going over them a second time and filling up, in 
order to supply shrinkage, for the pickles must be entirely cov- 
ered with the vinegar. Put in the corks, which should fit very 
^ugly^ li^ ^^^^ bottle (wrap a towel around it to prevent burn- 
ing the hands), and dip the corked end into the hot sealing-wax; 
proceed in this manner with each bottle, dipping each a second 
time into the wax so that they may be perfectly secure. If corks 
seem too small, throw them in boiling water ; if too large, pound 
the sides with a hammer. The tighter they fit in the bottles the 
better for the pickles. Glass cans, the tops or covers of which have 
become defective, can be used by supplying them with corks. 
Pickles thus bottled are far more wholesome than, and are really 
superior to, the best brand of imported pickles, and,- by having 
materials in readiness, prepared as directed, the process is neither 
difficult nor tedious. It requires two persons to successfully bot- 
tle pickles. — Mrs. Florence W. Hush, Minneapolis. 

Chow Chow Pickles. 
Let two hundred small cucumbers stand in salt and water closely 
covered for three days. Boil for fifteen minutes in half a gallon 
best cider vinegar, one ounce white mustard seed, one of black 
mustard seed, one of juniper berries, one of celery seed (tying each 
ounce separately in swiss bags), one handful small green peppers, 
two pounds sugar, a few small onions, and a piece alum half the 
size of a nutmeg ; pour the vinegar while hot over the cucumbers, 
let stand a day, repeating the operation three or four mornings. 
Mix one-fourth pound mustard with the vinegar, pour over cucum- 
bers, and seal up in bottles. — 3{rs. Ada Estelle Bever. 

Chow Chow. 

One peck of green tomatoes, half peck string beans, quarter peck 

small white onion?, quarter pint green and red peppers mixed, two 

large heads cabbage, four table-spoons white mustard seed, two of 

white or black cloves, two of celery seed, two of allspice, one small 

box yellow mustard, pound brown sugar, one ounce of turmeric; slice 

the tomatoes and let stand over night in brine that will bear an 

%; then squeeze out brine, chop cabbage, onions and beans, chop

tomatoes separately, mix with the spices, put all in porcelain ktsttle 
cover with vinegar, and boil three hours. 

CaUUPLOWER rtCKLES. 

Choose such as are fine and of full size, cut away all th« leaves, 
and pull away the flowers by bunches; soak ix, brine that will float 
an egg for two days, drain, put in bottles with whole black pepper, 
allspice, and stick cinnamon ; boil vinega*-, and with it mix mustard 
smoothly, a little at a time and just tiiick enough to run into the 
jars, pour over the cold cauliflow^ and seal while hot. An equal 
quantity or less of small white cuions, prepared, as directed in recipe 
for onion pickles, may be ad<Ied before the vinegar is poured over. 

C^hERY Pickles. 

Put together in a powselain-lined kettle two quarts chopped white 
cabbage, two quarts chopped celery, three quarts vinegar, half ounce 
each of crushed waite ginger root and turmeriCj fourth pound white 
mustard seed, two table-spoons salt, five of sugar; cook slowly sev- 
eral hours UKiil cabbage and celery are tender. 

Cucumber Pickles. 
Cover /\iP. bottom of cask with common salt ; gather the cucum- 
bers everr other day, early in the morning or late in the evenings 
as i^ does not injure the vines so much then as in the heat of the 
day ; cut the cucumbers with a short piece of the stem on, carefully 
'laying them in a basket or pail so as not to bruise ; pour cold water 
over and rinse, beuig careful not to rub off* the little black briers, or 
in any way to bruise them, as that is the secret of keeping them 
perfectly sound and good for any length of time. Lay them in a 
^jask three or four inches deep, cover with salt, and repeat the 
operation until all are in ; pour in some water with the first layer— 
ifter this the salt will make sufficient brine. Now spread a doth 
over them, then a board with a stone on.it When a new supply 
of cucumbers is to be added, remove stone, board and cloth, wash 
them very clean, and wipe every particle of scum from the top of 
the pickles and the sides of the cask; throw away any sofl ones, 
as they will spoil the rest; now put in the fresh cucumbers, layer 
by layer, with salt to cover each layer. Wh^ cask is nearly full, 
cover with salt, tuck cloth closely around the edges, placing the 
boai'd and weight on top; cover cask closely, and the pickles will be 



P1CKLE& 259 

perfect for two or three years. Cucumbers must always be put in 
the salt as soon as picked from the vines, for if they lie a day or 
two they will not keep. Do not be alarmed at the heavy scum 
that rises on them, but be careful to wash all off the board and 
cloth. When wanted for pickling, take off weight and board, care- 
iiilly lift cloth with scum on it, wash stone, board and cloth clean, 
and wipe all scum off the cucumbers and sides of cask, take out 
as many as are wanted, return the cloth, board and weight, nnd 
cover closely. Place the cucumbers in a vessel large enough to 
hold two or three times as much water as there are pickles, cover 
with cold water (some use hot), change the water each day for three 
days, place the porcelain kettle on the fire, fiU half full of vine- 
gar (if vinegar is very strong add half water), fill nearly full of 
cucumbers, the largest first and then the smaller ones, put in a 
lump of alum the size of a nutmeg, let come to a boil, stirring with 
a wire or wooden spoon so as not to cut the cucumbers ; after boil- 
ing one minute, take out, place in a stone jar, and continue until 
all are scalded, then pour over them cold vinegar. In two or three 
days, if the pickles are too salt, turn off the vinegar and put on 
fresh, add a pint of brown sugar to each two gallons pickles, a pod 
or two of red pepper, a very few cloves, and some pieces of horse- 
ladish. The horse-radish prevents a white scum from rising. 

Choppkd Pickles. 

Take a peck green ton^atoes, wash clean, cut away a small piece 
from each end, slice inul place in a large wooden bowl, chop fine, 
place in a crock and mix salt with them (half pint to a peck), let 
stand twenty -four hours, and drain thoroughly ; take twice or three 
times ao much cabbage as there is chopped tomatoes, chop fine, mix 
salt in same proportions, add enough water to make moist, and let 
stand same time as tomat>pes; drain, place again in separate jars, 
cover each with cold weak vinegar; after twenty-four hours drain cab- 
bage well, pressing hard to extract all the juice; place tomatoes and 
the vinegar in a porcelain kettle and let them boil for three minutes, 
stirring all the time, pour out, and when cold, place in a towal 
and wring and press until perfectly dry; now mix tomatoes and 
cabbage together, take a double handful at a time, squeeze as tightly 
as pussible, and place in a dry crock ; take the stone jar in which 



260 PICKLES. 

thej are to be pickled, place in it a layer of tomatoes and cab> 
bage, scatter over with chopped peppers, whole mustard seed, and 
horse-radish, then another layer of tx^matoes and cabbage, next spice, 
and so on until jar is almost full, occasionally sprinkling with cay- 
enne pepper; cover with strong cider vinegar, to each gallon of 
which a tea-cup of sugar has been added. Place a saucer or pieces 
of broken china on the pickles to keep them under the vinegar. If 
;i white scum rises, drain off vinegar, boil, skim, and pour hot over 
the pickles. Prepare mustard, peppers, and horse-radish, as follows f 
Take three green or ripe garden peppers (four table-spoons when 
chopped), cut in two, place in salt water over night, the next morn- 
ing drain and chop quite fine ; to two table-spoons mustard-seed add 
salt-spoon salt, pour in boiling water, let stand fifteen minutes and 
drain ; two table-spoons horse-radish chopped fine. Tomatoes and 
onions are excellent prepared in the same way. For sliced pickles, 
take cucumbers and onions, or tomatoes and onions, and slice and 
prepare as above. — Mrs. W. W. W. 

Manoobs. 
Select green or half grown muskmelons; remove a piece the 
length of the melon, an inch and a half wide in the middle and 
tapering to a point at each end ; take out seeds with a tea-spoon, 
secure one end of each piece to its own melon by a stitch made with 
a needle and white thread. Make a brine of salt and cold water 
strong enough to float an eg^, pour it over them, and after twenty- 
four hours take them out. For filling, use chopped tomatoes and 
chopped cabbage prepared as in "Chopped Pickles," small cucum- 
bers, small white onions, and nasturtium pods, each prepared by 
remaining in salt water in separate jars twenty-four hours; add also 
reeii beans boiled in salt water until tender. For spice, use cin- 
namon-bark, whole cloves, chopped horse-radish, cayenne pepper, 
mustard seed, the latter prepared as directed in " Chopped Pickles.* 
Prepare three or four times as much cabbage and tomatoes as of 
other articles, as any part left over may be placed in jar with vin- 
^|;ar poured over, and is ready for the table. Use one, or, if small, 
two cucumbers, two or three onions, and the same quantity of bean 
and nasturtium pods, placing them in mango first, with two or three 



PICKLES. 261 

doves, three or foui: sticks of cinuamou an inch long, and half a 
tea-spoon horse-radish, and filling up afterward with the chopped 
cabbage or tomatoes (mixing, or using them separately in alternate 
melons) pressing down very firmly, so that the mango is filled tight, 
sprinkling on the cayenne pepper last. Sew in the piece all around 
in its proper place with strong white thread; when all are thus 
prepared, place in a stone crock, cover with weak cider-vinegar, let 
remain over night; in the morning place the mangoes, and the 
vinegar in which they were soaked, in a porcelain kettle, boil half 
an hour, place in a jar, cover with good strong cider vinegar, let 
stand all night ; in the morning drain ofi* vinegar and boil it, add- 
ing one pint of sugar to each gallon, and pour boiling hot over the 
mangoes ; drain off and boil the vinegar three or four times, and 
they are done. This is not the usual way of preparing mangoes, 
but it is much the best. To pickle nasturtiums, soak as collected in 
salt and water for twenty-four hours, drain, and put into cold viii* 
egar ; when all the seed is thus prepared, drain, and cover with 
fresh boiling-hot vinegar. 

Peach Mangoes. 

Take un pared, fine, large peaches (free-stones); with a knife 
extract the stone from the side, place in jar, pour over them boiling 
water salted to taste, let sttmd twenty-four hours ; drop into fresh 
cold water and allow to remain ten or fifteen minutes ; wipe very 
dry, fill each cavity with grated horse-radish and white mustard- 
seed (prepared aS' directed in recipe for ** Chopped Pickles), a small 
piece of ginger-root, and one or two cloves; sew up, and place 
in a stone jar as close together as possible. Make a syrup in pro- 
portion of one pint sugar to three pints vinegar; pour, boiling hot, 
over them. They will be ready for use in a week, and are verv 

fine. /-Jf^ 

French Pickles. V 

One peck green tomatoes sliced, six large onions sliced; mix 

these and throw over them one tea-cup of salt, and let them stai I 

over night ; next day drain thoroughly and boil in one quart vij^* * 

gar mixed with two quarts of water, for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Then take four quarts vinegar, two pounds brown sugar, half 

pound white mustard-seed, two table-spoons ground allspice, and the

same of cinnamon, doves, ginger, and ground mustard ; tlirow all to- 
gether and boU fifteen minutes. — Mrs. Wm. Mappirif Mason Co., Ky. 

Pickled Onions. 
Select small silver-skinned onions, remove with a knife all the 
outer-skins, so that each onion will be perfectly white and clean. 
Put them into brine that will float an egg for three days, drain, 
[)lace in jar, first a layer of onions three inches deep, then a sprink- 
ling of horse-radish, cinnamon bark, cloves, and a UiJUe cayenne 
pepper; repeat until jar is filled, in proportion of half a tea-epoon 
cayenne pepper, two tea-spoons each chopped horse-radish and cloves, 
and four table-spoons cinnamon bark, to a gallon of pickles; bring 
vinegar to boiling point; add brown sugar in the proportion of a 
quart to a gallon, and pour hot over the onions. — EsAelk Woods 

Wilcox. 

Piccalilli. 

One large white cabbage, fif^y small cucumbers, five quarts smal> 
string-beans, eight small carrots, one dozen sticks celery, five red 
peppers, three green peppers, two heads cauliflower; chop fine, 
soak over night in salt and water, wash well, drain thoroughly, and 
pour over them hot vinegar spiced with mace, cinnamon and all- 
spice; turn ofl* vinegar and scald until safe to leave like common 
pickles; or seal in can while hot. — Mrs. W. L. 

Pyfer Pickles. 
Salt pickles down dry for ten days, soak in fresh water one day ; 
pour off" watei", place in porcelain kettle, cover with water and vin% 
egar, and ad(^l a tea-spoon pulverized alum (to each gallon) ; set 
over night on a stove which had fire in during the day; wash and 
put in a jar with cloves, allspice, pepper, horse-radish and onions or 
jxarlic ; boil fresh vinegar and pour over all ; in two weeks they will 
*-M)e ready for u?«e. These pickles are always fresh and crisp, and are 
made with much less trouble than in the old-fashioned way by 
keeping in hrm^.— Mrs. E. M. R. 

Pickled Peppers. 
*I'ake large green ones (the best variety is the sweet pepper)^ 
make a small incision at the side, take out all the seeds, being care* 
ful not to mangle the peppers; soak^in brine that will float an egg 



fli 



PICKLES, 263 

for two days, changing water twice ; stuff with chopped cabbage, or 

tomatoes seasoned with spice as for mangoes (omitting the cayenne 

pepper), or a mixture of nasturtiums, chopped onions, red cabbage, 

grapes, and cucumbers, seasoned with mustard-seed and a little 

mace. Sew up incision, place in jar, and cover with cold-spiced 

vinegar. 

Spanish Pickles. 

One dozen cucumbers, four heads of cabbage, one peck green 
tomatoes, one dozen ouions, three ounces white mustard-seed, one 
ounce celery seed, one ounce turmeric, one box Coleman's mustard, 
two and a half pounds brown sugar. Let the cucumbers stand in 
brine that will float an eg'g three days ; slice the onions, and chop 
cabbage and tomatoes, the day before making, and spruikle with 
salt in the proportion of half pint to a peck. When ready to make, 
squeeze brine out of cucumbers, wipe them off, peel and cut them in 
slices, let all simmer slowly in a kettle together for half an hour, 
and then bottle.— 

BiPE Tomato Pickles. 
Pare ripe, sound tomatoes (do not scald), put in a jar; scald 
spices (tied in a bag) in vinegar, and pour while hot over them. 
This recipe is best for persons who prefer raw tomatoes. 

Variety Pickles. 
One peck each of green tomatoes and cucumbers, and one quart 
onions ; pare, slice and salt (using a rounded half pint for all) each 
in separate jars, letting them stand in the salt twenty-four hours, 
and drain well, wringing and pressing in a cloth ; sprinkle fresh 
green radish-pods and nasturtium seeds with salt, and let stand for 
the same length of time ; boil in water salted to taste two quarts of 
half-grown, very tender bean pods, until they can be pierced with a 
silver fork, take out and drain. Now place each in a separate jar, 
cover with cold, weak vinegar for twenty-four hours, drain well, 
pressing hard to get out all the juice, cook tomatoes as in "Chopped 
Pickles," and then mix all well together. In a stone jar place 
first a layer of the mixture, sprinkle with mustard seed (prepared 
as directed in recipe for "Chopped Pickles)," horse-radish chopped 
fine, cinnamon bark, rings of garden peppers, and a few cloves, then 



264 PICKLES. 

another layer of the mixture, then the spice with a light sprink* 
ling of cayenne pepper. The spices used for this amount are 
nine table-spoons stick cinnamon, four and a half tea-spoons each 
of mustard-seed, cloves, and horse-radish, and twenty-seven rings 
of garden peppers. Cover with good cider vinegar, let stand 
over night, drain off vinegar, and boil in a porcelain kettle, add* 
iHg brown sugar in the proportion of one pint to a gallon of vin- 
egar ; skim well, pour hot over the pickles, continue to drain off 
and boil for several days. If not sweet enough, add more sugar^ 
although these are not intended for sweet pickles. The proportion 
of cucumbers may be double or even three times the quantity of 
tomatoes if desired. — Mrs. W, W, Wood^. 

Virginia Mixed Pickle. 
One-half peck green tomatoes, twenty-five medium-sized cucum- 
bers, fifteen large white onions, one-half peck sraafl onions, four 
heads cabbages, one pint grated horse-radish, one-half pound white 
mustard-seed, one-fourth pound ground mustard, one-half tea-cup 
ground black pepper, one-half pint salad oil, one ounce celery seed, 
one-half ounce ground cinnamon, two ounces turmeric. Slice the 
tomatoes and large onions, cut cabbage as for slaw, quarter cucum- 
bers 'engthwise, cut in pieces two inches long, leaving the peel on, 
and add the small onions whole. Mix with salt thoroughly, let 
stand twenty-four hours; drain off the juice, and pour vinegar and 
water over pickles. Let stand a day or two, strain again as dry as 
p<\ssible; mix the spices well except the ground mustard, then boil 
one and one-half gallons fresh apple vinegar and pour boiling hot 
over the pickles; do this three mornings in succession, using the 
same vinegar each time. The third time add one pound of sugar to 
the vinegar and boil, pouring over as above ; also mix the oil and 
ground mustard together with a small portion of the vinegar, and 
add when cold. Oil can be omitted if not relished. —Mn. M. B.

Pickled Walnuts. 

Grather walnuts (or butternuts) when soft enough to be pierced 

by a needle (July), prick each with a large needle well through, 

holding in a cloth to avoid staining the hands, cover with strong 

salt water (a pint and a half salt to a gallon of water), let stand two 



SWEET PICKLES. 265 

or three days, changing the brine every day ; then pour over them 
a brine made by dissolving salt in boiling water (let it get cold be- 
fore using), let stand three days, renew the brine and let it stand 
for three days more. Now drain and expose to the sun for two or 
three days or until they become black, or put in cold water for half 
a day, and pack in jars not quite full. The proportions are a hun- 
dred walnuts to each gallon of vinegar. Boil vinegar eight min- 
utes, with a tea-cup sugar, three dozen each whole cloves and allspice, 
'a dozen and a half pepper-corns, and a dozen blades of mace. Pour 
the vinegar over the walnuts scalding hot. In three days draw 
off the vinegar, boil and pour over the walnuts again iifhile hot, and 
at end of three days repeat the process. They will be fit to eat in 
a month, and will keep for years. — Mrs. C. T. Carson. 



SWEET PICKLES. 



Sweet pickles maybe made of any fruit that can be preserved^ 
including the rinds of ripe melons and cucumbers. The proportion 
of sugar to vinegar for syrup is three pints to a quart. Sweet pick- 
les may be made of any preserve by boiling over the syrup and 
adding spices and vinegar. Examine frequently, and re-scald the 
syrup if there are signs of fermentation. Fiums and other smootb- 
skinned fruits should be well pricked before cooking. The principal 
spices for sweet pickles are cinnamon and cloves. Use *' coffee C,** 
best brown, or good stirred maple sugar. 



Sweet Pickled Beets, 
Boil them in a porcelain kettle till they can be pierced with a 
silver fork ; when cool cut lengthwise to size of a medium cucum- 
ber; boil equal parts vinegar and sugar with half a table-spoon 
ground cloves tied in a cloth to each gallon ; pour boiling hot over 
the beets. — Mh. Samuel Woods 

Pickled Cucumbeks. 
Prepare and quarter ripe cucumbers, take out seeds, clean, lay 
in brine that will float an egg nine days, stirring eveiy day, take

alum size of a medium hulled hickory-nut to a gallon of water) 
over night, make syrup of a pint good cider vinegar, pound brown 
sugar^ two table-spoons each broken cinnamon bark, mace, and 
pepper grains; make sjrrup (three pints of sugar to a quart of vin- 
egar) enough to cover the slices, lay them in, and cook till tender.

Currant Pickles. 

Scald seven pounds ^ipe currants in three pounds sugar and one 

quart vinegar, remove currants to jar, boil for a few moments and 

pour over the fruit. Some add three pounds of raisins and spices. 

If not sweet enough, use only one pint vinegar. 

Pickled Grapes. 
Fill a jar with alternate layers of sugar and bunches of nice 
grapes just ripe and freshly gathered ; fill one-third full of good 
cold vinegar, and cover tightly. — Mrs, C. T Car&m. 

Spiced Grapes. 
Five pounds grapes, three of sugar, two tea-spoons cinnamon and 
allspice, half tea-spoon cloves ; pulp grapes, boil skins until tender, 
cook pulps and strain through a sieve, add it to the skins, put in 
sugar, spices and vinegar to taste ; boil thoroughly and cool.— ;M» 
Mae Stokes, Milord Center, 

Spiced Gooseberries. 
Leave the stem and blossom on ripe gooseberries, wash dean; 
make a syrup of three pints sugar to one of vinegar, skim, if neces- 
sary, add berries and boil down till thick, adding more sugar if 
needed ; when almost done, spice with cinnamon and cloves ; boil 
as thick as apple butter. 

Spiced Nutmeg Melon. 
Select melons not quite ripe, open, scrape out the pulp, peel, and

spice. Scald fruit, vinegar and spices together, and seal up in jars. 
This pickle should stand two or three months before using. Blue 
plums are delicious prepared in this way. — Mrs, Oen. Nayes, 

Peach Pickles. 
Pare freeetone peaches, place in a stone jar, and pour over them 
boiling-hot syrup made in the proportion of one quart best cider 
vinegar to three pints sugar; boil and skim, and pour over the 
fruit boiling hot, repeating each day until the fruit is the same 
color to the center, and the syrup like thin molasses. A few days 
before they are finished, place the fruit, after draining, in the jar to 
the depth of three or four inches, then sprinkle over bits of cinna- 
mon b»rk and a few cloves, add another layer of fruit, then spice, 
and so on until the jar is full; scald the syrup each morning for 
three jr four days after putting in the spice, and pour syrup boiling 
hot over fruit, and, if it is not sufficiently cooked, scald fruit with 
the syrup the last time. The proportion of spices to a gallon of 
fruit is, two tea-spoons whole cloves, four table-spoons cinnamon. 
To pickle clingstones, prepare syrup as for freestones ; pare fruit, 
put in the syrup, boil until they can be pierced through with a 
silver fork ; skim out, place in jar, pour the boiling sjrrup over 
them, and proceed and finish as above. As clings are apt to be« 
come hard when stewed in sweet syrup, it may often be necessary 
Id add a pint of water the first time they are cooked, watching 
carefully until they are tender, or to use only part of the sugar at 
first, adding the rest in a day or two. Use the large White Heath 
lilingstones if they are to be had. All that is necessary to keep 
iweet pickles is to have syrup enough to cover, and to keep the 
fruit well under. Scald with boiling syrup until fruit is of same 
K)lor throughout, and syrup like thin molasses ; watch every week, 
particularly if weather is warm, and if scum rises and syrup assumes 
% whitish appearance, boil, skim, and pour over the fruit. If at 
any time syrup is lacking, prepare more as at first. — Mn. M. J, TFoods. 

Pear Pickles. 
Prepare syrup as for peaches, pare and cut fruit in halves, or 
quarters if very large^i^nd if small leave whole, put syrup in porce- 
lain kettle, and when it boils put in fruit, cook until a silver fork 



268 SWEET PICKLES. 

will easily pierce them ; skim out fruit first apd place in jar, and 

last pour over syrup boiling hot; spice like peach pickles, draining 

them each day, boiling and skimming the syrup, and pouring it 

boiling hot over the fruit until fully done. By cooking pears so 

much longer at first they do not need to be boiled so frequently, 

but they must be watched carefully until finished, and if perfectly 

done, will keep two or more years. Apple pickles may be made in 

the same way, taking care to select such as will not lose shape in 

boiling. 

EucHERED Plumb. 

Nine pounds blue plums, six pounds sugar, two quarts vinegar, 

one ounce cinnamon; boil vinegar, sugar and spice together, pour 

over plums, draw off next morning and boil, pour back on plums, 

repeat the boiling five mornings, the last time boiling the fruit 

about twenty minutes. — Mrs. Capt W. B. Brown, Washington Cfty. 

PiO£LED Raisins. 
Leave two pounds raisins on stem, add one pint vinegar and 
half pound sugar ; simmer over a slow fire half an hour. — Mrs, 
Ji. \j, Jd., 

Strawberry Pickles. 

Place strawberries in bottom of jar, add a layer of cinnamon and 
cloves, then berries, and so on ; pour over it a syrup made of two 
coffee-cups cider vinegar, and three pints sugar, boiled about five 
minutes ; let stand twenty-four hours, pour off syrup, boil, pour 
over berries, and let stand as before, then boil berries and syrup 
slowly for twenty-five minutes ; put in jars and cover. The above 
is for six quarts of berries. Rne apples can be made in same way, 
allowing six and a half pounds of fruit to above proportions. — Mrs. 
T,\ W. Jones, Charleston, 8. C, 

Oreen Tomato Pickle. 
Take eight pounds of green tomatoes and chop fine, add four 
pounds brown sugar and boil down three hours, add a quart of 
vinegar, a teaspoon each of mace, cinnamon and cloves, and boil 
about fifteen minutes ; let cool and put into jars or other vessels. 
Try this recipe once and you will try it again. — Mrs, W. A, Orojffvt, 
New York OUy.

"Ripfi ToBiATO Pickle. 

Pan? And ^eigh i-ipe tomatoes and put into jars and just cover 
vith vinegar; after standing three days pour off the vinegar and 
add five pounds coffee sugar to every seven of fruit ; spice to taste 
and pour over tomatoes and cook slowly all day on the back of the 
stove. Use cinnamon, mace and a little dovea^ or not any, as pre- 
ferred. 

Watermeix)n Pickle. 

Pare off very carefully the green part of the rind of a good, ripe 
watermelon, trim off the red core, cut in pieces one or two inches 
in length, place in a porcelain-lined kettle, in the proportion of one 
gallon rinds to two heaping tea-spoons common salt and water to 
nearly cover, boil until tender enough to pierce with a silver fork, 
pour into a colander to drain, and dry by taking a few pieces at a 
time in the hand, and pressing gently with a crash towel. Make 
fiyrup, and treat rinds exactly as directed for pickled peaches. Con- 
tinue adding rinds, as melons are used at table, preparing them 
first by cooking in salt water as above ; when as many are prepared 
as are wanted, and they are nearly pickled, drain and finish as 
directed in peach pickles, except when the syrup is boiled the last 
time, put in melons and boil fifteen minutes ; set jar near stove, 
skim out melons and put in jar a few at a time, heating gradually 
so as not to break it, then pour in syrup boiling hot. A rind nearly 
an inch thick, crisp and tender, is best, although any may be used. 
If scum rises, and the syrup assumes a whitish appearance, drain, 
boil and skim syrup, add melons, and boil until syrup is like thin 
molasses. 

Clover Vikeoar. 

Put a large bowl of molasses in a crock, and pour over it nine 
bowk of boiling rain-water ; let stand until milk- warm, put in two 
quarts of clover blossoms, and two cups of baker^s yeafit; let this 
stand two weeks, and strain through a towel. Nothing will mold 
bit. — Mn. McAlistery Ghshetiy. 

Mint Vinegar. 
Put into a wide-mouthed bottle enough fresh, clean pepperminti 
spearmint, or garden parsley leaves to fill it loosely ; fill up with

good vinegar, stop closely, leave on for two or three weeks, pour 
off into another bottle, and keep well corked for use. This is ex- 
cellent for cold meats, soups and bread-dressings for roasts ; when 
mints can not be obtained, celery seed is used in the same way. — 
lfr«f J5. A. Fay. 

Spiced Vinegar. 

Put three pounds sugar in a three gallon jar with a small mouth; 
mix two ounces each of mace, cloves, pepper, allspice, turmeric, 
celery seed, white ginger in small bits, and ground mustard ; put in 
six small bags madi' of thin but strong muslin, lay in jar, fill with 
best cider vinegar, and use it in making pickles and sauces. 

Tarragon Vinegar. 

Gather the tarragon just before it blossoms, strip it from the 
larger stalks and put it into small stone jars or wide-necked bottle ; 
and in doing this twist the branches, bruising the leaves. Pour 
over it vinegar enough to cover; let it stand two months or 
longer, pour off, strain, and put into small dry bottles, cork weU 
and use as sauce for meats. 

Cauliflower Pickles. 

To twelve heads of cauliflower, five quarts of vinegar, five cups 
brown sugar, six eggs, one bottle French mustard, two tablespoon- 
ftiU ginger^ a few gs-rliCf two green peppers* one-half teaspoonfiil 
cayenne, butter size of an eigg^ one ounce pulverized turmeric Beat 
well together the eggs, sugar, mustard, ginger, and turmeric, then

flower in salt water until tender, then place carefully in jar, pour 
over the boiling hot mixture. — Mn, W. W. Eagtmatiy Mmneapdu. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles. 

Take twenty-four large cucumbers, ripe and sound, six white 
unions, four large red peppers ; pare and remove the seeds from 
the cucumbers, chop well, not too fine ; then chop fine onions and 
peppers, mix thoroughly with one cup salt, one ounce white mustard ; 
place in a muslin bag ; drain twenty-four hours, remove to glass 
jars, cover with cold vinegar and seal. They will keep a long 
time and are excellent. — Mrs, A. F, Oonkey,

POULTRY. 



Do not feed poultry for twenty-four hours before killing ; catch 
them without frightening or bruising, tie the feet together, hang up ' 
on a horizontal pole, tie the wings together over the back with a 
strip of soil cotton cloth ; let them hang five minutes, then cut the 
throat or cut off the head with a very sharp knife, and allow them 
to hang until the blood has ceased to drip. The thorough bleeding 
renders the meat more white and wholesome. Scald well by dip- 
ping in and out of a pail or tub of boiling water, being careful 
not to scald so much as to set the feathers and make them more 
difficult to pluck ; place the fowl on a board with head towards you, 
poll the feathers away from you, which will be in the direction 
they naturally lie (if pulled in a contrary direction the skin is 
likely to be torn), be careful to remove all the pin-feathers with a 
knife or pair of tweezers ; singe, but not smoke, over blazing paper, 
place on a meat-board, and with a sharp knife cut off the legs a 
litde below the knee, to prevent the muscles from shrinking away 
from the joint, and remove the oil-bag above the tail ; take out the 
crop, either by making a slit at the back of the neck or in front (the 
last is better), taking care that every thing pertaining to the crop 
or windpipe is removed, cut the neck-bone off close to the body, 
leaving the skin a good length if to be stuffed ; cut around the vent, 
cat a slit three inches long from the tail upwards, being careful to 
cat only through the skin, put in the finger at the breast and detach 
aD the intestines, taking care not to burst the gall-bag (situated 
near the upper part of the breast-bone, and attached to the liver; 
if broken, no washing can remove the bitter taint left on every 
spot it touches); put in the hand at the incision near the taO

and draw out careftilly all intestines ; trim off the &t from the 
• breast and at the lower incision ; split the gizzard and take 
out the inside and inner lining (throw liver, heart, and gizzard 
into water, wash well, and lay aside to be cooked and used 
for the gravy) ; wash the fowl thoroughly in cold water twice^ 
(some wipe carefully with a wet cloth, and afterwards with a dry- 
doth to make perfectly clean, instead of washing), hangup to drain, 
and it is ready to be stuffetl, skewered, and placed to roast. To 
make it look plump, before stuffiug, flatten the breast-bone by 
placing several thicknesses of cloth over it and pounding it, being 
careful not to break the skin, and rub the inside well with salt and 
pepper. Stuff the breast first, but not too full or it will burst in 
cooking ; stuff the body rather fuller than the breast, sew up both 
openings with strong thread, and sew the skin of the neck over 
upon the back or down upon the breast (these threads must be care- 
fully removed before sending to the table). Lay the points* of the 
wings under the back, and fasten in that position with a skewer run 
through both wings and held in place with a twine ; press the legs 
as closely towards the breast and side-bones as possible, and fasten 
with a skewer run through the body and both thighs, push a short 
skewer through above the tail, and tie the ends of legs down with a 
twine close upon the skewer (or, if skewers are not used, tie well 
in shape with twine); rub over thoroughly with salt and pepper, 
men lara, m Dne loliowmg manner: Hold the breast over a clear 
fire for a minute or dip it in boiling water. To make the flesh firm, 
cut strips of firm &t bacon, two inches long, and an eighth of an 
inch wide, and make four parallel marks on the breast, put one of 
these strips of bacon-fat (called lardoons) securely into the split end 
of small larding-needle, and insert it at the first mark, bringing it 
out at the second, leaving an equal length of fat protruding at each 
end ; continue inserting these strips, at intervals of half an inch 
down these two lines, and then do the same with the two others. For 
poultry use a small larding-needle ; the large ones are used foi 
larding beef or veal. The process is very simple, and any one who 
likes to bring out dainty dishes, will be more than repaid for the 
little trouble in learning how. All white-fleshed birds are improved 
by larding (as well as veal and sweet-bread). Small birds, such as 



POULTRY, 273 

quails, may be more conveniently ''barded" by placing a ''barde," 
a slice of &t bacon, over tbe breast, and the same plan may be 
adopted in all cases where larding is inconvenient ; or fat from the 
fewl itself may be used instead of bacon. When the flavor of bacon 
is disliked, put a tablespoon of butter in bits over the breast ; never 
dredge with flour in the beginning. Now place to roast in an 
oven rather hot at first, and then graduate the heat to moderate 
until done, to test which insert a fork between the thigh and body; 
if the juice is watery and not bloody it is done. If not served at 
once, the fowl may be kept hot without drying up, by placing over 
a skillet full of boiling water (set on top of stove or range) and 
inverting a dripping-pan over it. Many persons roast fowls upon a 
wire rack or trivet placed inside the dripping-pan, or patty pans 
or muflin-rings may be used as rests. The pan should be three or 
even four inches deep, and measure at the bottom about sixteen by 
twenty inches, with sides somewhat flaring. Some put to roast in 
a dry pan, the larding or butter making sufficient drippings for 
basting; others add a very little water. In roasting a turkey, 
allow twenty minutes time for every pound, and twenty minutes 
longer. Some steam turkey before roasting, and a turkey-steamer 
may be easily improvised by placing the dripping-pan containing 
the turkey on top of two or three pieces of wood (hickory or maple 
is the best) laid in the bottom of a wash-boiler, with just enough 
water to cover the wood ; put on the lid, which should fit tightly 
on the boiler, and as the water boils away add more. Add the 
liquor in the dripping-pan to the turkey when placed in the oven 
to roast (do not use the water from the boiler). In boiling fowl, 
put into hot water (unless soup is wanted, when place in cold); 
skim when it boils up first, and keep it just above the boiling point, 
but it must boil gently, not violently. A little vinegar added to the 
water in which they are boiled makes fowls more tender. For fuller 
directions see *' Meats." Boil the giblets until tender in a sepa- 
rate dish, and add them, well chopped, together with water in 
which they were cooked, to the gravy. 

TO CUT UP A CHICKEN. 

Pick, singe, and draw ; lay the chicken on a board kept for the 

purpose, cut off* the feet at first joint ; cut a slit in the neck, take 
18 



274 POULTRY. 

out the windpipe and crop, cut off the wings and legs at the joint 
which unites them to the body, separate the first joint of the 1^ 
from the second, cut off the oil-bag, make a slit horizontally under 
the tail, cut the end of the entrails hoae, extend the slit on each 
side of the joint where the legs were cut off; then, with the left 
hand, hold the breast of the chicken, and, with the right, bend 
back the rump until the joint in back separates, cut it clear and place 
in water. Take out the entrails, using a sharp knife to separate the 
eggs (if any), and all other particles to be removed, from the back, 
being careful in removmg the heart and liver not to break the gall- 
bag (a small sack of a blue-green color about an inch long attached 
to the liver); separate the back and breast ; commence at the high 
point of the breast and cut downwards tow^ard the head, taking 
off part of the breast with the wish-bone ; cut the neck from that 
part of the back to which the ribs are attached, turn the skin off 
the neck, and take out all lumps and stringy substances ; very care- 
fully remove the gall-bag from the liver, and clean the gizzard by 
making an incision through the thick part and first lining, peeling 
off the fleshy part, leaving the inside whole and ball-shaped ; if the 
lining breaks, open the gizzards, pour out contents, peel off inner 
lining, and wash thoroughly. After washing in second water, the 
chicken is ready to be cooked. When young chickens are to be 
baked, with a sharp knife cut open the back at the side of the 
back-bone, press apart, and dean as above directed, and place in 
dripping-pan, skin side up. 

Chickens are stuffed and roasted in the same way as turkeys, 
and are much better for being first steamed, especially if over a year 
old. Boast for twenty or thirty minutes, or till nicely browned. 
Some prefer to broil or fry old chickens after first steaming until 
tender, but stewing or boiling is better. In broiling chickens the 
danger of under-cooking on the one hand, or burning on the other, 
is avoided by breaking the bones slightly with a rolling-pin so that 
the pieces are flattened. Covering with a sauce-pan will also con- 
centrate the heat, and help cook them thoroughly without burning. 

Some, in making chicken or meat pies, line the bottom of the 
dish with crust, and place in the oven until well ** set,** then line 
the sides, fill, cover, and bake; it is always difficult to bake the 



POULTRY. 275 

crust on the bottom of dish unless this plan is adopted. A still 
better plan is to use no bottom crust, only lining the sides of the 
pan. 

The gariyshes for turkey and chicken are parsley, fried oysters, 
thin slices of ham, slices of lemon, fried sausages or forced-meat 
balls. 

Baked Chickens. 
Dress the chickens and cut them in two, soak for half an hour in 
cold water, wipe perfectly diy and put in a dripping-pan, bone side 
down, without any water ; have a hot oven, and, if the chickens are 
young, half an hour's cooking will be sufficient. Take out, and sea- 
son with butter, salt and pepper ; pack one above another as closely 
as possible, and place in pan over, boiling water^ covering them 
closely — ^this keeps them moist until served — boil the giblets in a 
little water, and, after the chickens are taken from the dripping-pan, 
pat into it the water in which giblets were boiled, thicken it, and add 
the chopped giblets. This manner of baking chickens is fully equal 
to broiling them. — Mr9. E, W. Herrick 

Baked Spring Chickens. 
Cut each of four chickens into seven or nine pieces, wash thor- 
oughly and quickly, and put in a colander to drain ; put a half 
table-spoon each of lard and butter into a dripping-pan, lay in the 
pieces, and add half a pint hot water ; place in oven and bake half 
an hour, turn, taking care that they get only to a light brown, and, 
just before taking up, add salt and pepper to taste ; when done 
take out in a dish and keep hot. To make the gravy, add a half 
pint or more of water, set the dripping-pan on the stove, and add 
one table-spoon flour mixed with half cup of cream or milk, stirring 
dowly, adding a little of 'the mixture at a time. Let cook thor- 
oughly, stirring constantly to prevent burning, and to make the 
gravy nice and smooth ; season more if necessar}'. — Mrs. L, Hvsh. 

Baked Chicken with Parsnips. 
Wash, scrape, and quarter parsnips, and parboil for twenty min- 
utes; prepare a young chicken by splitting open at back, place 
in a dripping-pan, skin side up, lay parsnips i^Tound the chicken, 
q>riDkle ¥riih salt and pepper, and add a lump of butter the size

separately on a platter, pouring the gravy in the pan over the pars* 

nips. 

Chicken Croquettes. 

Boil two fowls weighing five pounds each till very tender, mino« 
fine, add one pint cream, half pound butter, salt and pepper tc 
taste ; shape oval in a jelly glass or mold. Fry in lard like dough- 
nuts until brown. — Mrs. E. L. Fay^ New York (Xty. 

Bbeaded Chicken. 
Gut a tender chicken into seven pieces as if for frying, roll in 
beaten yolks of two eggs, then in finely grated bread crumbs seasoned 
with chopped parsley, pepper and salt ; place in dripping-pan, dot 
the pieces with bits of butter (one table-spoon in all), add a little 
water, bake slowly, basting often. When done, take out chicken 
and make gravy in the pan by adding a mixture of fiour and butter, 
make smooth by stirring. Add either cream or milk to make suffi- 
cient gravy, which season to taste. 

Broiled Chickens or Quails. 
Cut chicken open on the back, lay on the meat-board and pound 
until it will lie flat, lay on gridiron, place over a bed of coals, broil 
until a nice brown, but do not burn. It will take twenty or thirty 
minutes to cook thoroughly, and it will cook much better to cover 
with a pie-tin held down with a weight so that all parts of the 
chicken may lie close to the gridiron. While the chicken is broil- 
ing, put the liver, gizzard and heart in a stew-pan and boil in a 
pint of water until tender, chop fine and add flour, butter, pepper, 
salt, and stir a cup of sweet cream to tRe water in which they were 
boiled ; when the chicken is done, dip it in this gravy while hot, 
lay it back on the gridiron a minute, put it in the gravy and let 
boil for a half minute, and send to the table hot. Cook quails in 
the same way. — Mrs. ,A, 8. Chapman. 

Chili Colorad.

or fifteen minutes ; pour off water, and rub them in a sieve until 
all the juice is f>ut ; add the juice to the chicken ; let it cook for 
half an hour ; add a little butter, flour and salt. Place a border 
of rice around the dish before setting on table. This dish may also 
be made of beef, pork or mutton ; it is to be eaten in cold weather, 
and is a favorite dish' with all people on the Pacific coast. — Mrs. 
Gov. Bradley^ Nevada. 

Chickens for Lunch. 
Split a young chicken down the back, wash and wipe dry, s* ason 
with salt and pepper. Put in a dripping-pan, and place in a mod- 
erate oven ; bake three-quarters of an hour. This is much better 
for traveling lunch than when seasoned with butter. — Jfrs. W. B. 
Broymy Wcukingiony D. C. 

Chicken Pot-pie. 
Cut up a chicken and put on in hot water enough to cover, and 
take care that it does not cook dry ; while boiling cut off a slice 
from bread dough, add a small lump of lard, and mix up like light 
biscuit, roll, cut out with cake-cutter and set by stove to rise ; wash 
and pare potatoes of moderate size, and add them when chicken is 
almost done; when potatoes begin to boil, season with salt and pep- 
per, add dumplings and season again. See that there is water 
enough to keep from burning, cover very tightly, and do not take 
cover off until dumplings are done. They will cook in half an 
hour, and may be tested by lifting one edge of the lid, taking out 
a dumpling and breaking it open. Or, the dumplings may be placed 
in steamer over cold water, taking care to leave some of the holes 
in steamer open, as if all are covered by the dumplings, the steam 
will not be admitted, and they will not cook well. If there arc 
too many dumplings to lie on bottom without covering all holes, 
attach them to the side and upper edge of steamer by wetting 
dough and pressing it to the edge. When done remove to vegetable 
dish and pour hot gravy over them. Dish potatoes by themselves, 
and chickens and dumplings together. Make- gravy by mixing two 
level table-spoons flour and a little butter together, and stir into the 
hroth remaining in pot slowly, add more boiling water if needed and 
season with salt and pepper. Or, make dumplings with one pint 



278 POULTRY, 

gour milky two well-beaten eggs, half tea-spoon soda (mixed in part 

of the flour), and flour enough to make as stiff as can be stirred 

with a spoon ; or baking-powder and sweet milk may be used. Drop 

in by spoonfuls, cover tightly, and boil as above. A pot-pie may 

be made from a good boiling piece of beef; if too much grease 

arises skim off. 

Chicken Pie. 

Cut up two young chickens, place in hot water enough to cover, 
(as it boils away add more so as to have enough for the pie and for 
gravy to serve with it), boil until tender; line the sides of a four or 
six quart pan with a rich baking-powder or soda-biscuit dough quarter 
of an inch thick, put in part of the chicken, season -with salt, pepper 
and butter, lay in a few thin strips or squares of dough, add the lest 
of chicken and season as before; some add five or six fresh eggs or a 
few new potatoes in their season, season liquor in which the chickeii9 
were boiled, with butter, salt and pepper, add a part of it to the pie, 
cover with crust a quarter of an inch thick, with a hole in the 
center the size of a tea-cup. Keep adding the chicken-liquor as 
needed, since the tault of most chicken pies is that they are too dry. 
There can scarcely be too much gravy. Bake one hour in a mod- 
erate oven. 

Veal pias are similarly made, omitting eggs, and using two or 
three pounds veal to a quart of dough. Add to liquor loft in pot 
a table-spoon of butter mixed with flour to a paste, season with pep- 
per and salt, for gravy, adding water if needed. — L, A, C. 

CmcKfa? Pie with Oysters. 
Boil the chicken — a year old is best— until tender, drain ofl* 
liquor from a quart of 03'ster8, boil, skim, line the sides of a dish 
with a rich crust, put in a layer of chicken, then a layer of raw 
oysters, and repeat until dish is filled, seasoning each layer with 
pepper, salt, and bits of butter, and adding the oyster liquor and 
a part of the chicken liquor until the liquid is even with the top 
layer ; now cover loosely with a crust having an opening in the 
center to allow steam to escape. If the liquor cooks away, add 
chicken gravy or hot water. Bake forty minutes in a moderate 
oven. Make gravy hy adding to chicken liquor left in pot (one 
quart or more) two tablespoons flour, rubbed smooth with two 



POULTRY, 279 

tablespoons butter, and seasoned highly with pepper; let cook until 
there is no raw taste of flour and salt to taste and serve. 

Chicken Pudding. 
Dress and cut one chicken into small pieces, put it into a sauce- 
2MUQ or kettle with a little water, season with salt and pepper, let 
boil until it begins to grow tender, then take out and put into i; 
three-quart pudding dish ; have ready one quart green corn giated 
or cut fine, to which add three egg^i l>eaten light and one pint swei > 
milk ; season with salt and pepper, and .pour this mixture over the 
chicken, dredge thickly witli flour, lay on bits of butter and bake 
until done. — Mrs. A. Wikon, Rye, N. Y. 

Dressing for Chicken or Beef. 
Boil potatoes, mash as if for the table, except that they should be 
less moist, stuff* the chicken or roast with this, and bake as ordi- 
narily ; for ducks add onions chopped fine ; if the bread-dressing is 
wanted too, it may be laid in the corner of the pan. — Mn, Carrie 

Bed. 

Fricasseed Chicken. 

Gut up and put on to boil, skin side down, in a small quantity of 
water, season with salt, pepper, and slices of an onion if liked; 
stew gently until tender, remove chicken, add a half pint cream or 
milk to gravy, and thicken with butter and flour rubbed smoothly 
together (adding a little of the gravy to soften and help mix them)» 
let boil two or three minutes, add a little chopped parsley and serve. 
Or, first fiy the chicken brown in a little hot lard, take out chicken, 
add a table-spoon flour, and let cook a minute, stirring constantly; 
add a pint water (or stock if at hand), a little vinegar or Worces- 
tershire sauce, season with salt and pepper; when it has boiled,

Fried Spring Chicken. 

Put skillet on the stove with about half table-spoon each of lard and 
butter; when hot lay in chicken, sprinkle over Avith flour, salt and 
pepper, place lid on skillet, and cook over a moderate fire; when 
a light brown, turn the chicken and sprinkle flour, salt and pepper 
over the top as at first, if necessary add more lard and butter, and 
cook slowly until done ; make gravy just the same as for baked 
chicken. As a general rule half an hour is long enough to fry 
spring chicken. To make rich and nice gravy without cream, take 
the yolk of an egg^ beat up light, strain and stir slowly into the 
gravy after the flour and milk have been stirred in and thoroughly 
oooked; as soon as it boils up the gravy is done, and should be 
removed from the stove. All gravies need to be stirred well and 
thoroughly oooked over a moderate fire. — Mn. L. H. 

Fried Gumbo. 

Cut up two young chickens, and fry in skillet^ when brown but 
not scorched, put in a pot with one quart finely chopped okra, four . 
large tomatoes, and two onions chop{)ed fine; cover with boiling 
water, boil very slowly, and keep the kettle tightly closed; add 
boiling water as it wastes, and simmer slowly three hours ; season 
with salt, pepper, and a little butter and flour rubbed together; 
serve with boiled rice. — Mrs. J. H. S. 

Jelued Chicken. 

Cook six chickens in a small quantity of water, until the meat 
will part from the bone easily ; season to taste with salt and pepper; 
just as soon as cold enough to handle, remove bones and skin ; 
place meat in a deep pan or mold, just as it comes from the bone, 
using gizzard, liver and heart, until the mold is nearly full To 
the water left in the kettle, add three-fourths of a box of Cox's 
gelatine (some add juice of lemon), dissolved in a little warm water» 
and boil until it is reduced to a little less than a quart, pour over 
the chicken in the mold, leave to cool, cut with a very sharp knifii 
and serve. The slices will not easily break up if directiona 
followed. — Jfm Prof. Bobeiis, Cape QirardeaUf Mx

PiCKL£D Chicken. 

dl four chickens till tender enough for meat to fill from bones; 
pat meat in a stone jar, and pour over it three pints of cold vine- 
gar, and a pint and half of the water in which the chickens were 
boiled; add spices if preferred, and it will be ready for use in two 
days. — Emma Chuli Rea, 

Pressed Chickek. 
Take one or two chickens, boil in a small quantity of water with 
a little salt, and when thoroughly done, take all the meat from the 
bones, removing the skin, and keeping the light meat separate irom 
the dark ; chop and season to taste with salt and pepper. If a meat 
preaser is at hand take it, or any other mold such as a crock or 
pan will do ; put in a layer of light and a layer of dark meat till 
all is used, add the liquor it was boiled in, which should be about 
one tea-cupful, and put on a heavy weight ; when cold cut in slices. 
Many chop all the meat together, add one pounded cracker to the 
liquor it was boiled in, and mix all thoroughly before putting in the 
mold ; either way is nice. Boned turkey can be prepared in the 
same way, sUcing instead of chopping.' 

Steamed Chicken. 
Bub the chicken on the inside with pepper and half tea-spoon of 
Bcdt, place in steamer in a kettle that will keep it as near the water 
as possible, cover, and steam an hour and a half; when done keep 
hot while dressing is prepared, then cut them up, arrange on the 
platter, and serve with the dressing over them. The dressmg is 
made as follows : Boil one pint of gravy from the kettle without the 
&t, add cayenne pepper and half a tea-spoon salt; stir six table- 
spoons of flour into a quarter pint of cream until smooth, and add 
to the gravy. Com starch may be used instead of the flour, and 
some add nutm^ or celery salt. 

Boned Turkey. 

With a sharp knife slit the skin down the back, and raising one 
ride at a time with the fingers, separate the flesh from the bones 
with knife, until the wings and legs are reached. These unjoint 
from the body, and cutting through to the bone, turn back the 
flesh and remove the bones. When bones are removed, the fleah

wings, as they are most difficult to remove. Stuff with force-meat, 
made of cold lamb or veal and a little pork, chopped iine and sea- 
soned with salt, pepper, sage or savory, and the juice of one lemon ; 
sew into shape, turn end? of wings under and press the legs close to 
the back, and tie all firmly so that the upper surface may be plump 
and smooth for the carver. Lard with two or three rows on the 
top, and bake until thoroughly done, basting oflen with salt and 
water, and a little butter. This is a difficult dish to attempt. 
Carve across*in slices and serve with tomato-sauce. — Mr%, X Flem"

Boned Turkey. 

Bone and stuff as in preceding recipe, roll tight in a strong, clean 
doth, tie with tape in center and near the ends, and &sten ends 
firmly with strong twine, taking care to make the roll compact and 
perfectly secure; place in a rich stock, prepared by putting the 
bones in cold water with herbs, an onion peeled and stuck with ten 
cloves, and a sliced carrot and turnip, bringing to a boil, and skim- 
ming it until clear (if not enough to cover, add more boiling water), 
and boil four or five hours, take up, remove cloth, wash it in cold 
water, and replace turkey in it as before, place it between two 
platters under a heavy weight, and let stand over night to cool; 
strain the stock in which it was boiled, in the morning remove all 
fat, and put stock over the fire ; add to it two ounces gelatine dis- 
solved in a pint of cold water, and clarify as in general directions for 
"Soups." Stmiii through flannel until perfectly clear, pour it into 
two shallow molds, color one dark brown with caramel, and cool 
until the jelly is firm ; place turkey on a dish and garnish with the

tie the legs and wings close to the body, place in salted boiling 

water with the breast downward, skim often, boil about two houTS, 

but not till the skin breaks ; serve with oyster-sauce. — Mrs. E, L,

Roast Turkey. 

After picking and singeing the turkey, plump it by plunging 
qoickly three times into boiling water and then three times into 
coldy holding it by the legs ; place to drain and dress as in general 
directions; prepare stuffing by taking pieces of dry bread and 
crust (not too brown) cut off a loaf of bread fully three or four 
days old (but not moldy); place crust and pieces in a pan and 
pour on a very little boiling water, cover tightly with a cloth, let 
stand until soft, add a large lump of butter, pepper, salt, one or 
two fresh eggs, and the bread from which the crust was cut, so as 
not to have it too moist. Mix well with the hands and season to 
suit taste ; rub inside of turkey with pepper and salt, stuff it as 
already directed on page 272, and sew up each slit with a strong 
thread ; tie the legs down firmly, and press the wings closely to the 
«de8, securing them with a cord tied around the body (or use 
skewers if at hand), steam (page 273) from one to three hours (or 
ontil easOy pierced with a fork), according to the size, then place 
turkey in pan with water from dripping-pan in which the turkey 
was steamed ; lard the turkey, or place on the breast the pieces of 
&t taken from it before it was stuffed, sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per, dredge well with fiour; if not sufficient water in the pan, keep 
adding boUing water and baste often, as the excellence of the 
turkey depends much on this. Cook until a nice brown and per- 
fectly tender ; remove to a hot platter and serve with cranberry 
sauce and giblet gravy. To make the gravy, after the turkey is 
dished place the dripping-pan on the top of range or stove, skim 
off most of the fat, and add water if necessary ; chop the heart, 
gizzard and liver (previously boiled for two hours in two quarts of 
water), and add to the gravy with the water in which they were 
boiled, season with salt and pepper, add a smooth thickening of 
flour and water, stir constantly until thoroughly mixed with the 
gravy, and boil until the flour is well cooked. Some, in making 
stuffing, try out the fat of the turkey at a low temperature, and use 
instead of butter; others use the fat of sweet-pickled pork chopped 
fine (not tried out), and a small quantity of butter, or none at alL 
-lfr8. Judge J. L. Porter.

ROABT TUKKEY. 

Prepare and stuff as in preceding recipe, and lard as described 
in general directions; place in oven not quite as hot as for roast- 
ing meats (if the fire is very hot, lay a piece of brown paper, well 
greased, over the fowl, to prevent scorching) ; put a table-spoon of 
butter in bits on the breast ; it will melt and run into the dripping- 
pan, and is used to baste the fowl as roasting progresses; ba«te 
often (oiice in ten minutes), watching the turkey as it begins to 
brown, very carefully, and turning it occasionally to expose all parts 
alike to the heat ; it should be moist and tender, not in the least 
scorched, blistered or shriveled, till it is a golden brown all over. 
For the first two-thirds of the time required for cooking (the rule 
is twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes longer) the 
basting should keep the surface moistened so that it will not crisp 
at all ; meantime the oven should be kept as close as possible. In 
basting use the door that opens to the lefl, so that the right hand 
may be used conveniently through a small opening; and a long 
gauntlet glove is a good thing to protect the hand and arm during 
the operation. In turning the pan, do it as quickly as possible ; 
season with two tea-spoons salt when half done. In the last third 
of the time allowed for cooking, withdraw the pan partly from the 
oven (resting the end on a block of wood or a plain stool of the 
proper height kept for the purpose), and dredge the breast, upper 
portion and sides thoroughly, by sifting flour over the fowl from a 
fine sifter, return pan to oven, and let remain until the flour is well 
browned, then baste freely with drippings from the pan, and flour 
again, repeating the flouring and browning, and allowing the crust 
to grow crisixjr each time ; there will probably be time to repeat 
the process three or four times before finishing. Take care not to 
wash off the flour by basting ; give it time to brown on thoroughly, 
and do not take out of oven until all the flour of last dredging 
is thoroughly browned. If it is necessary to turn the turkey in the 
pan, use a towel, and never stick it with a fork, to allow the juice 
to escape. In roasting a large turkey, a liberal allowance of but- 
ter for cooking, including gravy for serving in two successive 
days, is one tea-cupful, but lass may be used, according to taste 
or necessity for economy. When done the entire surface will be a 



POULTRY. 285 

rich, filthy, brown crust, which breaks off in Bhelb in carving, 
and makes the most savory of morsels. Dish the turkey. 

To make the gravy, boil the heart, liver, gizzard and neck in two 
quarts of water for two hours, then take them up, chop gizzard, 
heart and liver, put them back again, thicken with one table-spoon 
of flour wet with cold water; season with salt and pepper ; after the 
turkey has been taken up, pour into dripping-pan, set on the top of 
the stove, and boil five minutes, stirring constantly, scraping the 
rides of the pan until free from the rich, savory particles that ad- 
here. Serve in a gravy-boat. 

RoABT Turkey with Oyster Dressing. 

Dress and rub turkey thoroughly inside and out with salt and 
pepper, steam two hours or until it begins to grow tender, lifting 
the cover occasionally and sprinkling lightly with salt. Then take 
out, loosen the legs, and rub the inside again with salt and pepper, 
and stuff with a dressing prepared as follows : Take a loaf of stale 
bread, cut off crust and soflen by placing in a pan, pouring on 
boiling water, draining off immediately and covering closely; 
crumble the bread fine, add half a pound melted butter, or more 
if to be very rich, and a tea-spoon each of salt and pepper, or 
enough to season rather highly; drain off liquor from a quart 
of oysters, bring to a boil, skim and pour over the bread -crumbs, 
adding the soaked crusts and one or two eggs ; mix all thoroughly 
with the hands, and if rather dry, moisten with a little sweet milk; 
lastly, add the oysters, being careful not to break them ; or first put 
in a spoonful of stufiing, and then three or four oysters, and so on 
until the turkey is filled ; stuff the breast first. Flour a cloth and 
place over the openings, tying it down with a twine ; spread the 
turkey over with butter, salt and pepper, place in a dripping-pan 
in a well-heated oven, add half a pint hot water, and roast two 
hours, basting often with a little water, butter, salt and pepper, 
kept in a tin fi)r this purpose and placed on the back of the 
stove. A swab made of a stick with a cloth tied on the end, is 
better than a spoon to baste with. Turn until nicely browned on 
all sides, and about half an hour before it is done, baste with butter 
and dredge with a little flour—this will give it a frothy appearance. 



286 POULTRY. 

When you dish the turkey if there is much fat in the pan, pour off 
most of it, and add the chopped giblets previously cooked until 
tender, and the water in which they were cooked, now stewed down 
to about one pint ; place one or two heaping table-spoons flour (it is 
better to have half of it browned) in a pint bowl, mix smooth with 
a little cream, flU up bowl with cream or rich milk and add to the 
gravy in the pan; boil several minutes, stirring constantly, and 
pour into the gravy tureen ; serve with currant or apple jelly. A 
turkey steamed in this way does not look so well on the table, but 
is very tender ^nd palatable. It is an .excellent way to cook a 
large turkey. 

English Boast Turkey. 

Kill several days before cooking, prepare in the usual manner, 
stufl* with bread-crumbs (not using the crusts) rubbed fine, moistened 
with butter and two eggs, seasoned with salt, pepper, parsley, sage, 
thyme or sweet marjoram ; sew up, skewer, and place to roast in a 
rack within a dripping-pan ; spread with bits of butter, turn 
and baste frequently with butter, pepper, salt and water; a few 
minutes before it is done glaze with the white of an egg ; dish 
the turkey, pour off most of the fat, add the chopped giblets and 
the water in which they were boiled, thicken with flour and butter 
rubbed together, stir in the dripping-pan, let boil thoroughly and 
serve in a gravy-boat. Grarnish with fried oysters, and serve with 
celery-sauce and stewed gooseberries. Choose a turkey weighing 
from eight to ten pounds. If it becomes too brown, cover with 
buttered paper. — Mrs, C, T, Carson,

Take oil from the water (when cold) in which turkey was boiled, 
strain into a porcelain kettle, add two ounces gelatine, three eggs, 
with shells, a wine-glass sherry or madeira; stir well. Add one 
quart strained liquor, beat rapidly with an egg-beater, put on fire, 
and stir till boils ; simmer ten or fifteen minutes, sprinkle with a 
pinch of turmeric, and strain as other jelly; when cold, break up 
and place over and around turkey. Cut in thick slices and fancifrd

SALADS. 



Vegetables used for salads are: boiled asparagus, cabbage, red 
and white; lettuce, chicory, boiled cauliflower, celery, dandelion, 
purslane, water-cress, etc. Prepare carefully by freshening in cool 
water, cleaning thoroughly of all foreign matters, drying carefully 
in a towel (avoiding as much as possible crushing the leaves, as it 
causes them to wilt), and then shredding with the fingers instead of 
cutting or chopping with a knife. Lettuce is oflen served with the 
leaves entire, reserving the tender inner leaves of lettuce for garnish- 
mg; cover with a "dressing," which consists chiefly of oil, vinegar, 
salt, pepper, and mustard, mixed in various proportions. All the 
ingredients of the dressing should be the very best. 

In preparing the dressing, powder the hard boiled eggs, either in 
a mortar or by mashing with the Imck of a silver spoon (if raw 
eg^ are used I)eat well and strain), add the seasoning, then the oil, 
a few drops at a time, and, lastly and gradually, the vinegar. Al- 
ways use the freshest olive salad oil, not the common sweet oil; if it 
can not be obtained, cream or melted butter is a good substitute and 
by some considered even more palatable, but when used it should be 
added last of all. In making chicken salad use the oil off the 
water in which the chickens were boiled. It is much nicer to pick 
the meat or cut it with a knife instead of chopping, always removing 
hits of gristle, fat and skin. The same is true of celery (in place 
of which celery seed may be used with white cabbage or nice head- 
lettuce, well chopped). To crisp celery, lettuce, cabbage, and all 
vegetables used for salads, put in ice-water for two hours before serv- 

(2»7) 



288 SALADS. 

ing. Pour the dressing over the chicken and celery, mixed and 
slightly salted ; toss up lightly with a silver fork, turn on a platter, 
form into an oval mound, garnish the top with slices of cold boiled 
eggs, and around the bottom with sprigs of celery, and set away in 
a cold place until needed. Salads should be served the day they are 
prep«ared. Vegetable salads should be stirred as little as possible, 
in order that their freshness may be preserved until they are served. 
To fringe celery stalks for use as a garnish for salads, meats, chicken, 
etc., cut the stalks into two-inch pieces ; stick several coarse needles 
into the top of a cork ; draw half of the stalk of each piece of celery 
through the needles several times. When all the fibrous parts are 
separated, lay the celery in some cold place to curl and crisp. Stir 
salads with a wooden fork or spoon. Many think turkey makes a 
nicer salad than chicken. Always make soup of the liquor in whioh 
turkey or chicken was boiled.

Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve. 

Unwonted softness to the salad give ; 

Of mordant mustard add a single spoon — 

Distrust the condiment which bites too soon ; 

But deem it not, though made of herbs, a' fault

And once witli vinegar procured from town. 

True flavor needs it, and your poet begs 

The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs.

And, half-suspected, animate the whole ; 

And lastly, on the favored compound toss 

A magic tea-spoon of anchovy sauce.

beaten into the other, dessertrgpoon of fine sugar. Add very fresh 

Bweet-oil poured in by very small quantities, and beaten as long as 

the mixture continues to thicken, then add vinegar till as thin as 

desired. If not hot enough with mustard, add a little cayenne 

pepper.— 3fr«. Gov. Cheney 

Salad Dressing. 
The yolks of two eggs beaten thoroughly, one level tea-spoon salt, 
one of pepper, two of white sugar, two tea-spoons prepared mustard, 
one table-spoon butter; stir in the mixture four table-spoons best 
vmegar, put dressing into a bowl, set it in a kettle of hot water, and 
stir constantly till it thickens ; set away, and when cool it is ready 
for use. This is sufiScieut for one quart finely-chopped cabbage, and 
should be poured over while hot, and thoroughly mixed with the 
cabbage, which may then be placed upon a platter, formed into an 
oyal mound, and served cold. 

Bottled Salad Dressing. 
Beat yolks of eight eggs, add to them a cup of sugar, one table- 
spoon each of salt, mustard, and black pepper, a little cayenne, and 
half a cup of cream ; mix thoroughly ; bring to a boil a pint and a 
Wf vinegar, add one cup butter, let come to a boil, pour upon the 
mixture, stir well, and when cold put into bottles, and set in a cool 
place. It will keep for weeks in the hottest weather, and is excel- 
lent for cabbage or lettuce. 

Cream Dressing for Cold Slaw. 
Two tablespoons whipped sweet cream, two of sugar, and four 
of vinegar ; beat well and pour over cabbage, previously cut very 
fine and seasoned with salt. — MisB Laura Sfiarp^ Klngeton. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. 
^t a raw egg (some use the yolks only) with a salt-spoon of salt 
(usmg a wooden-spoon) until it is thoroughly smooth, add a tea-spoon

mixed mustard made rather thicker than usual ; when quite smooth 
add by degrees (a few drops only at a time) a half-pint of olive-oil, 
taking care to blend each portion of it with the egg before adding 
more. This ought to be as smooth as honey, and thick enough so 
that a spoon will stand up in it ; dilute with vinegar until it assumes 
the consistency of thick cream. A little anchovy may be added if 
desired. Lemon juice may be used instead of vinegar, or a few 
drops may be added with the vinegar. This is the smoothest and 
richest of salad dressings. The oily flavor is entirely lost in com- 
bination with the raw egg. When you begin to add the oil, drop a 
very little at first as it may curdle the egg. This sauce keeps well, 
if bottled and corked with a glass stopper, and it may be made at 
any time in advance, if only yolks are used, when yolks are lefk 
over from baking. In summer, place oil and eggs in a cold place, 
half an hour before making. 

Salad-Dressino with Potato. 

Peel one large potato, boil, mash until all lumps are out, and add 
the yolk of a raw egg, stir all well t<jgether and season with a tea- 
spoon of mustard and a little salt ; add about half a gill of olive- 
oil and vinegar, putting in only a drop or two at a time, and stir- 
ring constantly, as the succass of the dressing depends on its smooth« 
ness. This dressing is very nice with celery or cabbage chopped 
fine, and seasoned with a little salt and vinegar. — Mrs. E, L, Fay. 

Otsteb Salab. 

Half gallon each fresh oysters and celery cut into dice, yolks of 
four hard-boiled eggs, a raw egg whipped, two large spoons melted 
butter, two tea-spoons each of salt, black pepper and made mustard, 
one tea-cup vinegar, two pickled cucumbers cut fine. Drain liquor 
from oysters, throw in hot vinegar on the fire, let them stay until 
plump, not cooked. Put at once in cold water, drain off, and set in 
cool place ; prepare dressing. Bub salt, pepper and mustard with 
the yolks finely mashed ; add butter, a few drops at a time. When 
smooth, add beaten egg, then vinegar by the spoonful ; set aside. Mix 
oysters, celery and pickle, tossing up well with a silver fork; salt to 
taste. Pour dressing over all. — Mn, OoL O, 8. Park, Parkville, Mo. 



SHELL-FISH. 



There is not a lover of oysters in existence who does not heartily 
sympathize with the boy who wanted to spell August " O-r-g-u-s-t," 
in order to bring it into the list of the months which contain an **r,* 
in all of which oysters are in season. The delicious bivalves furnish 
an important, and, in most localities, a not expensive article of food ; 
and the ease with which they are prepared for the table, and the 
great variety of ways in which they may be cooked and served, 
make them a great favorite with housekeepers. 

Oysters in the shell must be kept in a cool cellar, and occasionally 
sprinkled with salt water. When fresh, the shell is firmly closed; 
if open, the oyster is dead and unfit for use. The small-shelled 
oysters have the finest flavor. For the freshness of canned oysters 
it is necessary to tni^t to the dealer, but never buy cans the sides 
of which are swollen. . In preparing them for cooking or for the 
table, carefully remove all bits of shell. Never salt oysters for 
soups or stews till just before removing them from the fire, or they 
will shrivel up and be hard, and do not add butter. In frying, a 
Uttk bahing-jxywder added to the cracker-dust or corn-meal in which 
they are rolled will greatly improve them. Boasting in the shell 
preserves the natural flavor. Always serve immediately after' cooking^ 
no matter what method is used. 

As to nutritive qualities, oysters rank much below butcher's meats, 
and it is even questioned whether they contain the phosphorus, or 
brain food, which has been credited to them in company with the 
finny tribe in general. But, when properly cooked, they are easy 
of digestion, and very proper food for persons whose occupation is

sedentary, and whose duties do not call for heavy muscular exertion. 
Even for invalids, they are nutritious and wholesome, when deli- 
cately prepared. 

Clam Chowder. 
Chop fifty clan)/B, peel and slice ten raw potatoes, cut into dice six 
oiiions and a half pound fat salt pork, slice six tomatoes (if canned 
use a coffee-cup inll), add a pound i)ilot crackers; first put pork in 
l»ottom of pot and try out, partially cook onions in pork-fat, remove 
ihe mass from pot, and put on a plate bottom side up ; make layers 
of the ingredients, season with pepper and salt, cover with water 
and boil an hour and a half, adding chopped parsley to taste. 

Clam Pie. 
Take three pints of either hard or soft-shell clams (if large, chop 
slightly), put in a sauce-pan and bring to a boil in their own liquor^ 
or add a little water if needed ; have ready four medium-sized po* 
tatoes, boiled till done and cut into small squares ; make a nice pie< 
paste with which line a medium-sized pudding-dish half way down 
the sides ; turn a small tea-cnp bottom up in middle of dish to keep 
up the top crust ; put in first a layer of clams, and then a few po- 
tatoes, season with bits of butter and a little salt and pepper, and 
dredge with fiour; add another layer of clams, and m on till dish 
is filled, adding juice of clams, and a little water if necessary (there 
should be about as much liquid as for chicken-pic). Cover with 
top-crust, cutting several slits for steam to escape, and bake thre» 
quarters of an hour. — Mrs. A. Tf%on, Rye; N. Y, 

Clam Stew. 

Take half peck hard-shell clams, wash shells clean, and put in a 
kettle with about one tea-cup water ; let steam until the shells open, 
when take out of shell, strain juice, and return it with clams to th<^ 
fire ; after they come to a boil, add one pint milk, a piece of butter 
size of an e^g, three crackers rolled fine, pepper, and salt if any is 
needed. — Mrs, A. W. 

Fried Clams. 

Bemove from shell large soft-shell clams; beat an egg well and 
add two table-spoons water ; have the clam? dried in a towel, and 
dip them first in the egg, then in finely-n iled cracker or bread* 



SHELL-FISH. 297 

crombsy and fry (longer than oysters) in sweet lard or butter. Oys* 
ters may be prepared for cooking in same way. — Mrs, A. W, 

Deviled Crabs. 
Pick the meat irom a boiled crab and cut in fine bits, add one* 
third as much bread-crumbs, two or three chopped hard-boiled eggs, 
and lemon juice; season with pepper, salt, and butter or cream. 
Clean tho shells nicely and ^11 with the mixture, sprinkle oyer with 
bread-crumbs and small bits of butter, and brown in oven. Lob- 
sters may be prepared in same way, and served in silver scallop- 
shells. Or, boil one pint milk, and thicken with one table-spoon 
com starch mixed in a little cold milk, season with pepper (cayenne 
may be used) and salt, and pour over the picked-up lobster ; put in 
baking-dish, and cover with bread-crumbs and a few pieces of but- 
ter, and brown in oven. — Mrs, Cd. S., Norfolk, Va, 

Boiled Oysters. 

Wash shell-oysters perfectly clean, place in a small willow basket, 
drop in a kettle of boiling water, and when shells open, lift basket, 
and serve oysters on the half shell. 

Broiled Oysters. 

Dry large, selected oystei-s in a napkin, pepper and salt, and 
broil on a fine folding wire-broiler, turning frequently to keep the 
juice from wasting. Serve immediately in a hot dish with little 
pieces of butter on them. Or, pepper a cup of dry bread-crumbfe, 
dry one quart of oysters in a napkin, dip each in butter previously 
peppered, roll well in the crumbs, and broil over a good fire for 
five to seven minutes. Serve immediately in a hot dish with but- 
ter, pepper and salt. 

Broiled Oysters with Pork. 

String a hair-pin shaped wire, first with an oyster, then with a 
thin slice of pork; and so on until the wire is filled ; fasten ends of 
wire into a long wooden handle, and broil before the fire. Serve, 
with the pork, if you like, seasoning slightly with pepper. 

Oyster Croquettes. 
Scald and chop fine hard part of the oysters (after taking the 
other part and liquor for a soup), add an equal weight of mashed 
potato ; to one pound of this add lump of butter the size of an egg.

tea-spoon salt, half tearspoon of pepper, and quarter of a tea-cup 
cream. Make in small cakes, dip in egg and then in btead-crumbs, 
and fry like doughnuts. 

Broiled Oysters on the Half-shell. 
Select large shells, clean with a brush, open, saving juice ; put 
oysters in boiling water for a few minutes, remove and place each 
oyster in a half-shell| with juice ; place on a gridiron over a brisk 
fire, and when they b^in to boil, season with butter, salt and 
pepper (some add a drop of lemon juice.) Serve on the half-ehelL 

Curried Oysters. 

Put the liquor drained from a quart of oysters into a sauce-pan, 

add a half-cup of butter, two table-spoons flour, and one of curry 

powder, well mixed ; let boil, add oysters, and a little salt; boil up 

once and serve. 

Deviled Oysters. 

Wipe the oysters dry and lay in a flat dish, cover with a mixture 

of melted butter, cayenne pepper (or pepper sauce), and lemon 

juice. Let them lie in this fi>r ten minutes, turning them frequently ; 

take out, roll in cracker crumbs, then in beaten egg, then in 

crumbs, and fry in hot lard and butter, half and half 

EscALOPED Oysters. 
Take crushed crackers, not too fine ; drain liquor from a quart 
of oysters and carefully remove all bits of shell, butter a deep 
dish or pan, cover the bottom with crackers, put in a layer of oys- 
ters seasoned with salt and pepper and bits of butter in plenty, 
then a layer of crackers, then oysters, and so on until dish is full^ 
finishing with the crackers covered with bits of butter ; pour over 
the whole the oyster-liquor added to one pint of boiling water 
(boiled and skimmed), place in a hot oven, bake half an hour, add 
another pint of hot water, or half pint water and half pint of milk, 
in which a small lump of butter has been melted ; bake another 
half hour, and, to prevent browning too much, cover with a tin or 
sheet-iron lid. All bread-crumbs, or a mixture of crackers and 
bread-crumbs may be used when more convenient. As the amount 
of liquor in oysters varies, and the proportion of crackers or bread- 
crumbs to the oysters also varies, the quantity of water must be 



SHELL-FISH. 299 

increased or diminished according to judgment and taste. Some 
prefer to cook half the time given above. Boiled macaroni may be 
used in place of cracker-cmmbs. 

Terrapin. 

Cut off head, put on to boil with shell on ; when done enough, 
remove under shell, and pick terrapin in pieces. Clean top shell 
well; add a few crackers, onions, parsley, allspice, salt, pepper, 
butter, and wine; return to shell, garnish with sliced lemon, and 
bake. Add Cayenne pepper, if liked, in seasoning. Terrapin or 
turtle' steaks are fine smothered in an egg batter before frying. — 
Mrs, J. C. Oioena, Oiarleston, South Carolina. 

Fried Oysters. 

Drain carefnUy, remove all bits of shell, and sprinkle with pepper 
£:nd :^lt, and set in a cool place for ten or fifteen minutes. Then, 
T oysters are small, pour them into a pan of crackers rolled fine, 
add the liquor, mix well, and let stand five minutes, add a little salt 
and pepper, mold into small cakes with two or three oysters in 
each, roll in dry crackers until well encrusted, and fry in hot lard 
and butter, or beef-drippings. Serve hot in a covered dish. 

Or, dip the oysters in the yolk of eggs, well seasoned and beaten, 
then in corn meal with a little baking powder mixed with it, and 
fry in hot lard like doughnuts ; or if you have frying basket, place 
them on that and drop it in the hot lard. Test the heat as for 
doughnuts. 

Or, drain thoroughly, put in a hot frying-pan, turn so as to 
brown on both sides. They cook in this way in a few moments, 
and the peculiar flavor of the oysters is well preserved. Serve on 
a hot covered dish, with butter, pepper and salt, or add a little 
cream just before serving, and sei-ve on toast ; or take two parts 
rolled crackers and one part com meal, mix well, roll the oysters in 
it, and fry in equal parts butter and lard. Season with salt and 
pepper.— ifr». W, W, Wood». 

Fried Oysters. 
To fry oysters, take two dozen large oysters (they are sold under 
different names and brands in different markets), drain off liquor; 



300 



SHELL-FISH. 



have prepared cracker dust (bought of any grocer, or made by 
crushmg with rolling pin), mix well one tea-spoon salt, take one oys- 
ter at a time, roll in cracker dust, and lay on a meat board or plat- 
ter by itself until all are so encased, and laid in rows ; let remain 
fifteen minutes, now take the oyster first rolled in cracker dust and 
dip in beaten eggs (yolk and white beaten together), then the second 
oyster, and so on until all are dipped, then roll in cracker dust, 
following same order as before. Let them remain from half to 
three-quarters of an hour. It is important to follow the same cnrder 
in each operation, to give the liquor of the oyster time to drain 
out and be absorbed by the cracker dust ; now heat in a frying-pan 
one pound of clarified fat or lard ; when the blue smoke arises 
(which indicates a heat of 376°, the proper cooking point), drop 
into it a peeled potato or piece of hard bread, which has the effect 
of preventing the fat growing hotter, drop in the oysters very lightly, 
and when a light brown turn to brown the other side ; and then 
remove to a colander to drain a moment, or lay upon a piece of 
brown paper, which will absorb the superfluous grease. The time 
for cooking is about three minutes. Serve while Jwt on a hot platter. 
Fried oysters, to be at their best, must be eaten as soon as cooked; 
and when a second supply is likely to be needed, it should be cooked 
while the first is being served and eaten. It is better not to touch 
the oysters with the hand, as it tends to make them tough ; all the 
rolling and dipping may be done with a fork, without mangling the 
oyster. 

Fricasseed Oystebs. 

Take a slice of raw ham (corned and not smoked), soak in 
boiling water for half an hour, cut in very small sUces and put 
in a sauce-pan with two-thirds pint of veal or chicken broth well 
strained, the liquor from one quart oysters, one small onion minced 
very fine, a little chopped parsley, sweet marjoram and pepper. 
Let these simmer twenty minutes, boiling rapidly for two or three 
minutes. Then skim well and add one scant table-spoon of com 
starch mixed smoothly in one-third cup of milk, stir constantly, 
and when it boUs add the oysters and one ounce of butter ; just let 
it come to a boil, remove oysters to a deeper dish, then beat one 
egg and add to it gradually some of the hot broth, and when cooked 



8HELL-FISE. 301 

etir it into the pan ; season with salt and pour all over the oysters. 

When placed upon the table some squeeze the juice of a lemon 

over it. 

Oyster Fritters. 

Drain off liquor, boil, skim, and to a cupful add a cup of milk, 

two or three ^gs, salt and pepper, and fiour enough to make a 

rather thick batter. Have hot lard or beef drippings ready in a 

kettle, drop the batter into it with a large spoon, taking up one 

oyster for each spoonful. The oyster must be large and plump. 

Oyster Omelet. 
Add to a half cup of cream six eggs beaten very light, season 
with pepper and salt, and pour into a frying-pan with a table-spoon 
of butter ; drop in a dozen large oysters cut in halves, or chopped 
fine with parsley, and fry until a light brown. Double it over, and 
serve immediately. — Mn, T. B. Johnson, Thiscvmbia. 

Panned Oysters. 
Cut stale bread in thin slices, then round them, removing alt 
crust. Make them to fit patty-pans; toast them, butter, and 
place in pans. Moisten with three or four tea-spoons of oyster 
liquor; then place on the toast a layer of oysters, sprinkle with 
pepper, and put on top a small piece of butter; place pans in a 
baking pan and put in oven, covering with a tin lid, or if not large 
enough, another pan to keep in the steam and flavor ; have a quick 
oven, and when cooked seven or eight minutes, until **ruflied," 
remove cover and sprinkle with salt ; replace cover and cook one 
minute longer. Serve in the patty-pans. This is delicious. 

Oyster Pie. 

Line a deep pie-dish with puff-paste; dredge with flour, pour in 
one pint oysters, season well with bits of butter, salt and pepper, 
and sprinkle flour over; pour on some of the oyster-liquor, and 
cover with a crust having an opening in the center to allow the 
steam to escape. 

Or, line the pie-dish half way up with good pie-crust, fill the dish 
with pieces of stale bread, place a cover of paste over this, and 
bake about twenty minutes in a brisk oven. Take off crust, have 
teady some oysters prepared as for patties, fill the pie with them. 



302 



SHELL-FISH. 



and replace the crust and serve at once*; or line dish with a good 

puff-paste, place an extra layer around the edge, and bake in a brisk 

oven ; fill with oysters, season with pepper, salt, and one table-spoon 

butter, sprinkle slightly with flour, and cover with a thin crust of 

paste ; bake quickly ; when the top crust is done, the pie will be 

ready to take up. Serve promptly, as the crust quickly absorbs the 

gravy. Some like this cold for picnics or traveling. — Mrs, Carrie 

Heck 

Oyster Pickles. 

To every quart of liquor add a teii-spoon of black pepper, a pod 

of red pepper broken in bits, two blades of mace, a tea-spoon salt, 

two dozen cloves, and half a pint of best vinegar, add the oysters 

and simmer gently for a few minutes, take out and put in small 

jars; then boil the pickle, skim it, and pour over them. Keep 

them in a dark, cool place, and when a jar is opened, use up its 

contents as quickly as possible. Oysters pickled thus will keep 

good four or five weeks. 

Oyster Roll. 

Cut a round piece, say six inches across, from the top of a well- 
baked round loaf of bread, remove the inside from the loaf, leaving 
crust half an inch thick; make a rich oyster stew, and put in the 
loaf first a layer of it, then of bread-crumbs, then oysters, and so 
on ; place cover over the top, glaze the loaf with the beaten yolk 
fif sua ftgg, and place in oven for a few moments. Serve very hot. 

Raw Oysters. 

Wash the shells, open, detaching the flat shell, loosen from the 
deep shell, but leave them in it, and serve half dozen on a plate, 
with a quarter of lemon in center. Eat with salt, pepper and lemon 
juice or vinegar. 

In serving them without the shells the most attractive way is in 
H dish of ice, made by freezing water in a tin form shaped like a 
salad bowl, or in a block of ice from which a cavity has been 
melted with a hot flat-iron. They should first be drained well in a 
colander, sprinkled with plenty of pepper and salt, and placed on 
the ice and let remain in a cool place for half an hour or imtil time 
of serving. 

A simpler and equally delicious way is to drain well, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and place the dish on ice or in a dish of cold 



SHELL-FISH. 303 

ivater for half an hour before serving, adding bits of ice. Serve 
with horse'radish, Chili sauce, slices of lemon, or simply vinegar. 

Oysters in the Shell. 
Open the shells, keeping the deepest ones for use. Melt some 
butter, season with minced parsley and pepper. When slightly 
cooled, roll each oyster in it; using care that it drips but little, and 
lay in the shells. Add to each shell a little lemon juice, cover with 
grated bread-crumbs, place in a baking-pan and bake in a quick 
oven ; just before they are done, add a little salt. Serve in tiie 

Oyster Spew. 
Put the liquor from the oysters on the stove, let boil, skim, and 

season with butter and pepper, add oysters, let come to a hoU only, 

eeason with salt and serve. This is pronounced a ** royal stew.** 

Steamed Oysters. 
Lay some oysters in the shell in some air-tight vessel, placing the 
tipper shell downward so the liquor will not run out when they 
open. Set them over a pot of boiling water (where they will get 
the steam), and boil hard for twenty minutes; if the oysters are 
open they are done ; if not, steam till they do open. Serve at once 
and eat hot, with salt and a bit of butter. Or, wash and drain one 
quart select oysters, put in pan and place in steamer over boiling 
water, cover and steam till oysters are plump with edges ruffled; 
place in heated dish with butter, pepper and salt, and serve. 

Walled Oysters. 
Make a wall one and one-half inches high and three-quarters wide 
of one quart nicely mashed and seasoned potatoes, just inside raised 
edge of platter, glaze it by covering with beaten egg and placing in 
oven for a few minutes. Place the liquor from one quart oysters in 
porcelain kettle, let boil, skim well, then^dd oysters seasoned with 
salt, boil up once, skim out oysters (milk or water can be added to 
the liquor, then seasoned with butter and pepper, and served as 
soup), and add them to a cream dressing made by putting a tea-cup 
rich cream, butter size of half an egg, and a little pepper and tea- 
spoon salt in a pan placed within a vessel of boiling water ; when 
hot add two ounces of flour mixed smooth in some cream or milk, 
and let cook till thickened, then place oysters and dressing within 
the potato and serve immediately. 



SOUPS. 



To make Dutritious, healthful and palatable soup, with flavors 
properly commingled, is an art which requires study and practice, 
but it is surprising from what a scant allotment of material a deli- 
cate and appetizing dish may be produced. The best base for soup 
is lean uncooked meat, a pound of meat to a quart of water, to 
which may be added chicken, turkey, beef, or mutton bones well 
broken up; a mixture of beef, mutton and veal, with a bit of ham 
bone, all cut fine, makes a higher flavored soup than any single 
meat ; the legs of all meats are rich in gelatine, an important con- 
stituent of soup. For white stock use veal or fowls instead of beef. 

Soups, which make the principal part of a meal, should be richer 
than those which simply precede a heavier course of meats, etc. 

When remnants of cooked meats are used, chop fine, crush the 
bones, add a ham bone or bit of bam or salt pork (two or three 
cubic inches) and all ends of roasts and fatty parts, and the brown 
&t of the roast ; make the day previous to use ; strain, set away 
over night, skim off* the fat (which clarify and save for drippings), 
and it is ready to heat and serve. 

When soup is desired for a first course, daily, a soup-kettle should 
be especially provided, with a faucet to draw off* the clear soup to 
be seasoned for each day ; and all the bones and bits of meat left 
after dinner can be thrown into the kettle, also bits of vegetables 
and bread, and the gravies that are left from roast meats and cut- 
lets. In this way there will be nothing lost, and the soups can be 
varied by seasonings and thickenings of different kinds. Every 
two or three days, however, the contents of the kettle should be 
turned out, after all the liquid hai« been drawn off, and the kettle 



SOUPS. 306 

irafihed dean and scalded, for if this is not attended to, the fsoups 
will soon lose their piquant flavor and become stale. 

In using fresh meat throw the pieces as cut into the required 
quantity of cold water and let stand until the juices of the meat 
begin to color it, then put on to boil ; in this way the juices of the 
meat are more readily drawn out. The soup is done when the meat 
is juiceless. 

The best herbs are sage, thyme, sweet marjoram, tarragon, mint, 
sweet basil, parsley, bay-leaves, cloves, mace, celery-seed and onions. 
Plant the seed of any of the seven flrst-mentioned in little boxes 
OD the window sill, or in a sunny spot in the yard. Grather and 
dry them as follows: parsley and tarragon should be dried in June 
and July, just before flowering; mint in June and July; thyme, 
marjoram and savory in July and August ; basil and sage in August 
and September ; all herbs should be gathered in the sunshine, and 
dried by artificial heat ; their flavor is best preserved by keeping 
them in air-tight tin cans, or in tightly-corked glass bottles. 

Seasonings for soups may be varied to suit tastes. The simplest 
may have only pepper and salt, while the richest may have a little 
of every savor, so delicately blended that no one is conspicuous. 
The best seasoning is that which is made up of the smallest quan' 
tity from each of many spices. No measure can be given, because 
the good soup-maker must be a skillful taster. There must be a 
flavor of salt; that is, the water must not be insipid (less is needed 
if bits of salt meat are used), there must be a warm tone from the 
pepper, but not the taste of pepper; in short, the spicing should be 
delicate rather than profuse. Those who like rank flavors may add 
them to suit their coarse and uneducated palates. For brown soups 
the dark spices may be used ; for white, mace, aromatic seeds, cream 
and curry. Many herbs, either fresh or dried, are used as seasoning, 
and all the choice catsups and sauces. 

Rice, sago, pearled barley, vermicelli, macaroni, etc., are desir- 
able additions to meat soups. The flrst three are used in the pro- I 
portion of half a tea-cup to three quarts of soup ; wash and soak. ^ 
Rice requires half to three-quarters of an hour, boiling in the soup; 
sago cooks in fifteen minutes ; barley should be soaked over night, 

or for several hours; boil by itself in a little water till tender; add 

20 I 



806 



SOUPS, 



to the soup just before serving. Vermicelli and macaroni should 
be broken up small, and washed thoroughly ; boil in the soup half 
an hour. 

' If a soup is wanted without any addition of vegetables, but thick- 
ened, arrow-root or corn starch is used in the proportion of two 
round tea-spoons of the latter and two scant tea-spoons of the former 
to a quart of soup. Mix with a little water until smooth, and add 
when the soup is nearly done. Wheat flour is also used for thick- 
ening, but it requires three round table-spoons to the quart. If not 
thick enough to suit the taste more may be added. Browned flour 
does not thicken, the starchy property having been removed in the 
browning process. 

Thickened soups require more seasoning than thin soups ; if wanted 
very clear and delicate, strain through a hair sieve. 

Always use cold water in making all soups ; skim well, especially 
during the first hour. There is great necessity for thorough skim- 
ming, and to help the scum rise, pour in a little cold water now and 
then, and as the soup reaches the boiling point, skim it off Use 
salt at first sparingly, and season with salt and pepper ; allow one 
quart soup to three or four persons. 

For a quick soup, crush the bone and cut the meat rather fine ; 
when done, strain and serve. Every kitchen should be provided 
with a soup-kettle (which has a double bottom), or a large iron pot 
with a tight-fitting tin cover with a hole size of a large darning- 
needle in it i^t one side of the handle. Keep kettle covered closely, 
eo that the flavor may not be lost, and simmer slowly, so that the 
quantity may not be much reduced by evaporation, but if it has 
boiled away (which may be the case when the meat is to be uaed 
for the table), pour in as much hot water as is needed, and add 
vegetables, noodles, or any thickening desired. Vegetables should 
be added just long enough before soup is done to allow them to he 
thoroughly cooked. An excellent soup for a small fiimily may he 
made from the bones and trimmings cut from a steak before broil- 
ing. The bones from a rib roast, which are generally cut out and 
thrown away by the butcher, after weighing, should always he 
ordered sent with roast and used for soup. 

For coloring and flavoring soups, use caramel, browned flour.

onions fried brown, meat with cloves in it, or browned with butter. 
Poached eggs are an excellent addition to some soups. They should 
be added just before serving, one for each person. They may be 
poached in water or dropped into the boiling soup, or two or three 
eggs, well-beaten and added just before pouring in tureen, make a 
nice thickening. Cayenne pepper or a bit of red pepper pod, Wor- 
cestershire, Halford, or Chili sauce, and catsups, are considered by 
many an improvement to soup, but must be cautiously used. Force- 
meat balls, made of the meat boiled for the soup, are also used. 

SOUP STOCK. 

To four pounds of lean beef (the inferior parts are quite as good 
for this purpose) put four quarts of cold water (soft is best), wash 
the meat and put it in the water without salt ; let it come slowly to 
boiling point, skim well before the agitation of the water has broken 
the scum, add a little salt, and a dash of cold water, to assist the 
scum to rise, skim again, set back and let it boil gently on one side 
or in one place, and not all over (" the pot should smile, not laugh "), 
for six or eight hours, until the meat is in rags (rapid boiling 
hardens the fiber of the meat and the savory flavor escapes with the 
steam), add a little pepper, strain into a stone jar, let it cool, and re- 
move all the grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold 
weather, and from it can be made all the various kinds of soups b; 
adding onion, macaroni, celery, asparagus, green pease, carrot, 
tomato, okra, parsley, thyme, summer savory, sage, and slices of 
lemon; many of the herbs may be first dried, then pulverized and 
put in cans or jiu*s for winter use. Celery and carrot seed may be 
used in place of the fresh vegetables. Macaroni should be first 
boiled in slightly salted water, cut in pieces one or two inches long, 
and added a short time before serving. To prepare soup for dinner, 
cut off a slice of the jelly, add water, heat and serve. Whatever is 
added to this, such as rice, tapioca, vegetables, etc., may first be 
cooked before being added, as murh boiling injures the flavor of the 
stock. 

A rich stock can also be made from a shank or shin of beef 
(knuckle of veal is next best) ; cut in several pieces, crack the 
bones, add four quarts water, boil up quickly, skim, add salt, skim, 
and let boil gently until the liquor is reduced one-half; strain, cool 



/

and skim, and if boiled praperlj and long enough, an exoeUent jelly 
will result. Too violet boiling makes the stock cloudy and' dark. 
To clarify stock that has been darkened by careless skimming and 
improper boiling, mix one egg and shell in a gill of cold water, add 
a gill of the boiling soup, then stir into the soup until it boils up; re- 
move to back of stove, and let stand until the white and shell of the 
egg have collected the particles that color the soup, and strain once or 
twice until it looks clear. Stock should never be allowed to stand 
and cool in the pot in which it is cooked ; pour into an earthen dish, 
let stand to cool uncovered, when all the &t should be removed and 
saved to clarify for drippings ; the stock is then ready for use as 
wanted for soups or gravies. The flavor of stock may be varied by 
using in it a little ham, anchovy, sausage, sugar, or a calf's foot. 
Sprigs of herbs, and whole spices may be used in seasoning, and 
afterward strained out. Delicate flavors should be added just before 
serving, as boiling evaporates them. Stock made from meat without 
bone or gristle will not jelly, but will taste very like good beef- 
tea. Never boil vegetables with stock, as they will cause it to 
become sour. 

An economical soup-stock may be made of steak or roast-beef 
bones, after cooking, adding a little piece of fresh meat, or none at 
all, and allowing it to simmer at least five hours; strain, remove all 
&t the next day, and it will be ready for use. 

SOUP FROM STOCK. 

To make soup from any stock, put on as much stock as needed 
(if in jelly, scrape the sediment from off* the bottom), add seasoning, 
water and vegetables. The potatoes should be peeled, sliced, and 
laid in salt and water for half an hour, the cabbage parboiled and 
drained, and all others either sliced or cut fine, before adding them 
to the soup; boil until thoroughly dissolved, strain through a 
colander and serve at once. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

When stock is drawn ofi*, season with celery salt. A little vermicelli 
boiled in it for fifteen minutes will give it more body — or some of 
the fancy letters, stars, triangles, etc., that are made particularly 
for soups can be used, or egg-balls can be made by mixing raw egg 
with just enough wheat flour or corn starch to make it into round 



SOUPS, 309 

balls, then drop them into the soup and boil for ten minutes. A 
little milk, a tea-spoon to one egg, is an improvement ; also a 
sprinkle of salt. These balls are sometimes called '* noodles/' If a 
richer soup is needed, take slices of mw veal and a little salt pork, 
and chop very fine with a slice of wheat bread. Season highly with 
pepper, salt, tomato catsup, and chopped lemon peel, moisten with 
two well-beateu eggs, and roll into balls as large as a walnut, with 
floured hands. Fry the balls in butter to a dark brown, and h ". 
them cool; turn into the soup and boil about ten minutes. Cut a 
lemon into very thin bits, slice two hard-boiled eggs, put them into 
the tuieen ; add a glass of claret or port wine to them and turn in 
aoup; it is a very ** dainty dish." 

Clam Soup.*

Take thirty large ones, put a basin under, 

And cleave, with knife, their stony jaws asunder; 

Add water (three quarts) to the native liquor. 

Bring to a boil, (and, by the way, the quicker 

It boils the better, if you'd do it cutely.) 

Kow add the clams, chopped up and minced minutely. 

Allow a longer boil of just three minutes, 

And while it bubbles, quickly stir within its 

Tumultuous depths where still the mollusks mutter, 

Four tablespoons of flour and four of butter, 

A pint of milk, some {>epper to your notion, 

And clams need salting, although born of ocean. 

Remove from fire ; (if much boiled they will sufifer— 

You'll find that India-rubber is n't tougher.) 

After 'tis off, add three fresh eggs, well-beaten, 

Stir once more, and it's ready to be eaten.

SOUPS, 



skim thoroughly and continue to boil slowly from three to six hours, 
accofding to size and quality of meat ; one hour before dinner, put 
in cabbage cut in quarters, sprinkling it with salt; quarter of an 
hour after add turnips halved or quartered according to size; quarter 
of an hour after turnips, add potatoes whole, or cut in two if lai^ge 
(turnips and potatoes should be pared aud laid in cold water half 
an hour before using). When done take out vegetables and meat, 
place in heater, or if you have no heater, place plates over a pot or 
skillet of boiling water. If there is not enough soup, add boilings 
water, stir in a little thickening of flour and water, let it boil thor- 
oughly ; season to the taste with salt anjl pepper and serve at once. 
The soup will be excellent and the vegetables very fine. 

Asparagus Soup. 
Cut the tops from about thirty heads of asparagus, about half an 
inch long, and boil the rest ; cut off all the tender portions and rub 
through a sieve, adding a little salt; warm three pints soup stock, 
add a small lump of butter and a tea-spoon of flour previously 
cooked by heating the butter and slowly stirring in the flour ; then 
add the asparagus pulp. Boil slowly a quarter of an hour, stirring 
in two or three table-spoons cream ; color the soup with a tea-spoon 
of prepared spinach, made by pounding the spinach well, adding a 
few drops of water, squeezing the juice through a cloth and putting 
it over a good fire. As soon as it looks curdy, take it off*, and strain 
the liquor through a sieve. What remains on the sieve is to be used 
for coloring the soup. Just before serving soup, add the asparagus 
tops which have been separately boiled. 

Beef Soup. 
Take the cracked joints of beef, and after putting the meat in the 
pot and covering it well with water, let it come to a boil, when it 
should be well skimmed. Set the pot where the meat will simmer 
slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping it closely covered all the 
time. The next day, or when cold, remove the fat which hardens 
on the top of the doup. Peel, wash and slice three good-sized 
pytatoes and put them into the soup ; cut up half a head of white 
cabbage in shreds, and add to this a pint of Shaker com that has 
been soaked over night, two onions, one head of celery, and tomatoes 



SOUPS. 311 

if desired. When these are done, and they should simmer slowly, 
care being taken that they do not bum, strain (or not as preferred) 
the soup and serve. The different varieties of beef soup are formed 
by this method of seasoning and the different vegetables used in 
preparing it, after the joints have been well boiled. Besides onions, 
celery, cabbages, tomatoes and potatoes, many use a few carrots, 
turnips, beets, and force-meat balls seasoned with spice; rice or bar- 
ley will give the soup consistency, and are to be preferred to flour 
for the purpose. Parsley, thyme and sage are the favorite herbs 
for seasoning, but should be used sparingly. To make force-meat 
balls, add to one pound chopped beef one egg, a small lump butter, 
a cup or less of bread-crumbs ; season with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with the water from stewed meat ; make in balls and fry 
brown, or make egg- balls by boiling eggs, mashing the yolks with 
a silver spoon, and mixing with one raw yolk and one tea-spoon 
flour ; season with salt and pepper, make into balls, drop in soup 
just before serving. — Mrs. H. B. Sherman, 

Beef Soup with Okra. 
Fry one pound ** round" steak cut in bits, two table-spoons 
butter, and one sliced onion, till very brown ; add to three or four 
quarts cold water in soup-kettle, and boil slowly one hour ; then add 
pint sliced okra, and simmer three hours or more ; season with salt 
and pepper, strain and serve. — Mrs. T. B. J., Tuscumbia, Ala. 

Beef Soup. 
Take bones and trimmings from a sirloin steak, put over fire after 
breakfast in three quarts water, boil steadily until about an hour 
before dinner, when add two onions, one carrot, three common-sized 
potatoes, all sliced, some parsley cut fine, a red pepper, and salt to 
taste. This makes a delicious soup, sufficient for three persons. 
All soups are more palatable seasoned with onions and red pepper, 
using the seeds of the latter with care, as they are very strong. 

Bean Soup. 

Boil a small soup-bone in about two quarts water until the meat 

can be separated from the bone, remove bone, add a coffee-cup white 

beans soaked for two hours, boil for an hour and a half, add three 

potatoes, half a turnip and a parsnip, all sliced fine, boil half an

crumbs; season with salt and pepper, and serve with raw onions 
sliced very fine for those who like them. — Mrs. A. B, Morey. 

Turtle Bean Soup. 
Soak one pint black beans over night, then put them into three 
quarts water with beef bones or a smalFpiece of lean saltpork, boil 
three or four hours, strain, season with salt, pepper, cloves and 
lemon juice. Put in a few slices of lemon, and if wLshed add slices 
of hard-boiled eggs. Serve with toasted bread cut into dice and 
placed in the tureen. — Mrs. H. C. Qark, 

Saturday Bean Soup. 
Baked beans and brown bread form a Sunday break&st for so 
many that the following will be a useful and economical soup for 
Saturday dinner. Put on the pot with more beans t!i.;n enough for 
Sunday's breakfast, with water, and slice of salt pork ; parboil till 
beans are ready to be put in oven. Take out' pork and part of 
beans, leaving enough for a bean soup ; place the pot on back of 
stove and keep hot. Three-quarters of an hour before dinner heat 
soup, add more water and vegetables as in " Bean Soup." 

Meatless Bean Soup. 
Parboil one pint beans, drain off the water, add firesh, let boil 
until perfectly tender, season with pepper and salt, add a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, or more if preferred ; when done skim 
out half the boans, leaving the broth with the remaining h^lf in 
the kettle, now add a tea-cup sweet cream or good milk, a dozen or 
more crackers broken up; let it boil up, and serve. 

Carrot Soup. 

Put in soup-kettle a knuckle of veal, three or four quarts cold 
water, a quart finely-sliced carrots, one head celery ; boil two and a 
half hours, add a handful rice, and boil an hour longer; season 
with pepper (or a bit of red pepper pod) and salt, and serve. 

Celery Cream Soup. 

Boil a small cup rice in three pints milk, until it will pass through 
a sieve. Grate the white |jart of two heads of celery (three if 
small) on n brend-gi-ater ; add this to the rice milk after it has been

.; put to it a quart of strong white stock; let boil until cel- 
ery is perfectly tender; season with salt and cayenne, and serve. If 
cream is obtainable, substitute one pint for the same quantity of 
milk. 

Chicken Soup. 

In boiling chickens for salads, etc., the broth (water in which 
they are boiled) may be used for soup. When the chickens are to 
be served whole, stuff and tie in a cloth. To the broth add a dozen 
tomatoes (or a quart can), and one thinly-sliced onion ; boil twenty 
minutes, season with salt and pepper, add two well-beaten eggs, and 
serve. -< 

Clam Soup. 
Wash clams, and place in just sufficient water for the soup, let 
boil, and as soon as they clear from shells, take out and place clams 
in a jar for pickling ; throw into the broth a pint each of sweet 
milk and rolled crackers, add a little salt, boil five Minutes, and 
just before taking from the fire, add one ounce butter beaten with 
two eggs. Serve, and let each person season to taste. 

Green Corn Soup. 

One large fowl, or four pounds veal (the knuckle or neck will do), 
put over fire in one gallon cold water without salt, cover tightly 
and simmer slowly till meat slips from the bones, not allowing it to 
boil to rags, as the meat will make a nice dish for breakfast or 
Innch, or even for dinner. Set aside with the meat a cup of the 
liquor ; strain the soup to remove all bones and rags of meat ; grate 
one dozen ears of green corn, scraping cobs to remove the heart of 
the kernel, add com to soup, with salt, pepper, and a little parsley, 
and simmer slowly half an hour. Just before serving add a table- 
spoon flour beaten very thoroughly with a table-spoon butter. Serve 
hot. To serve chicken or veal, put broth (which was reserved) in 
a clean sauce-pan, beat one egg, a table-spoon butter and a tea- 
spoon flour together very thoroughly, and add to the broth with 
salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. Arrange meat on dish, 
pour over dressing, boiling hot, and serve at once.

Mock Turtle or Calf's-head Soup. 
Lay one large calfs head well cleaned and washed, and four pig^s 
feet, in bottom of a large pot, and cover with a gallon of water ; 
boil three hours, or until flesh will slip from bones ; take out head, 
leaving the feet to be boiled steadily while the meat is cut from the 
head ; select with care enough of the £eitty portions in the top of the 
head and the cheeks to fill a tea-cup, and set aside to cool ; remove 
brains to a saucer, and also set aside ; chop the rest of the meat 
with the tongue very fine, season with salt, pepper, powdered mar- 
joram and thyme, a teaspoon of cloves, one of mace, half as much 
allspice and a grated nutmeg. When the flesh falls from the bones 
of the feet, take out bones, leaving the gelatinous meat ; boil all 
together slowly, without removing the cover, for two hours more ; 
take the soup from the fire and set it away until the next day. An 
hour before dinner set the stock over the fire, and when it boils 
strain carefully and drop in the meat reserved, which should have 
been cut, when cold, into small squares. Have these all ready as 
well as the force-meat balls, to prepare which rub the yolks of five 
hard-boiled eggs to a paste in a wedgewood mortar, or in a bowl 
with the back of a silver spoon, adding gradually the brains to 
moisten them, also a little butter and salt. Mix with these, two 
eggs beaten very light, flour the hands and make this paste into 
balls about the size of a pigeon's egg : throw them into the soup 
five minutes before taking it from the fire ; stir in a large table- 
s|X)on browned flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water, and finish 
• he seasoning by the addition of a glass and a half of sherry or 
Aiaderia wine, and the juice of a lemon. It should not boil more 
than half an hour on the second day. Serve with sliced lemons. 

Mutton Soup. 
Boil a nice leg of mutton, and take the water for the soup, add 

two onions chopped fine, potato, half a cup of barley, and two large 

tomatoes ; season with pepper and salt, boil one hour, stir often (as 

Nurlev is apt to burn), and, before taking from the fire, add one

Noodle Soup. 
Add noodles to beef or any other soup after straining ; they will 
cock in fifteen or twenty minutes, and are prepared in the follow- 
ing manner : To one egg add as much sifted flour as it will absorb, 
with a little salt ; roll out as thin as a wafer^ dredge very lightly 
with flour, mil over and over into a large roll, slice from the ends, 
•hake out the strips loosely and drop into the soup. 

Okra Soup. 
Take a nice joint of beef flUed with marrow, one gallon water, 
one onion cut fine, two sprigs parsley, half a peck of okra, one 
quart tomatoes; boil the meat six hours, add vegetables and boil 
two hours more. — Mrs. E. L. F. 

Oyster Soup with Milk. 
Pour one quart cold water over one quart oysters if solid ; if not 
solid, use one pint of water, drain through a colander into the soup- 
kettle, and when it boils skim ; add pepper, then the oysters ; season 
with butter and salt, then add one quart rich new milk brought to 
boiling point in a tin pail set in a pot of boiling water, let boil up 
and serve at once. Or, instead of adding the milk, place it, boiling 
hot, in tureen, pour the soup over it and then serve. 

Plain Oyster Soup. 

Pour a quart oysters in colander, rinse by pouring over them 

pint cold water, put this in porcelain kettle, add a pint boiling

oven till of a rich-brown color), adding tomatoes or anj other 
vegetables which one may fancy. A leek or a section of garlic 
adds much to the flavor. Rice mav be added, or vermicelli for a 
change. Just before serving, burn a little brown sugar and stir 
through it. This gives a peculiar flavor and rich color to the soup. — 
Mrs. Col. (Jifford ThompBon, New York OUy. 

Green Pea Soup. 

Boil three pints shelled pease in three quarts of water ; when quite 
soft, mash through a colander, adding a little water to free the pulp 
from the skins ; return pulp to the water in which it was boiled, add 
a head of lettuce chopped, and half a pint young pease ; boil half 
an hour, season with salt and pepper, and thicken with two table- 
spoons butter rubbed into a little flour. Serve with bits of toasted 
bread. The soup, when done, should be as thick as cream. Some 
omit the lettuce. 

Potato Soup. 

To one gallon of water add six large potatoes chopped fine, one 
tea-cup rice, a lump of butter size of an egg, one table-spoon flour. 
Work butter and flour together, and add one tea-cup sweet cream 
just before taking from the fire. Boil one hour. — ARss Lida Omby. 

Swiss Soup. 

Five gallons water, six potatoes and three turnips sliced ; boil five 
hours until perfectly dissolved and the consistency of pea soup, fill*

veal or lamb, and an onion, may be added to vary this soup. 

Tomato Soup. 

Skim and strain one gallon of stock made from nice fresh beef; 
take three quarts tomatoes, remove skin and cut out hard center, 
put through a fine sieve, and add to the stock ; make a paste of 
butter and flour, and, when the stock begins to boil, stir in half a 
tearcup, taking care not to have it lumpy; boU twenty minutes, 
seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Two quarts canned 
tomatoes will answer. — Mrs. CoL Reid, Delaware. *

Turkey-Bone Soup. 

After a roasted turkey has been served a portion of the meat still 
adheres to the bones, especiallj about the neck; * drumsticks" are 
left, or parts of the wings, and pieces rarely called for at table. If 
there is three-fourths of a cupful or more left cut off carefully and 
reserve for force-meat balls. Break the bones apart and with stuffing 
still adhering to them, put into a soup-kettle with two quarts water, 
a table-spoon salt, a pod of red pepper broken into pieces, three or 
fi)ur blades of celery cut into half inch pieces, three medium-sized 
potatoes, and two onions all sliced. If the dinner hour is one o'clock 
the kettle should be over fire before eight o'clock in the morning; or 
If the dinner is at six in the evening, it should be on by twelve 
o'clock. Let it boil slowly but constantly until about half an hour 
before dinner ; lift out bones, skim 6ff fat, strain through colander, 
return to soup-kettle. There will now be but little more than a quart 
of the soup. If more than this is desired, add a pint of hot milk 
or milk and cream together; but it will be very nice without this ad- 
dition even though a little more water be added. Prepare the force- 
meat balls by chopping tlie scraps of turkey very fine ; take half a 
teaspoon cracker-crumbs, smoothly rolled, a small salt-spoon of cay- 
enne pepper, about double the quantity of salt, a little grated lemon 
peel and half a teaspoon powdered summer-savory or thyme ; mix 
these together and add a raw beaten egg to bind them. Roll mix- 
ture into balls about the size of a hickory-nut, and drop into the soup 
ten minutes before serving. Have ready in tureen a large table- 
spoon of parsley, cut very fine. Pour in soup, and send to table 
hot. If force-meat balls ai'e not liked, boil two eggs for half an hour, 
cut in slices, put them in tureen with the parsley, and pour the soup 
over them ; or slices of bread (not too thick) can be toasted, but- 
^tt«d on both sides, cut into inch squares, and substituted for the 
weed eggs. — Mrs, JR. K Hcaardy Kxrhwoodj Mo,

SOUPS. 



Vegetable Soup. 
After boiling a soup bone or piece of beef until done, add to the 
broth boiling water to make the amount of soup wanted, and 'when 
boiling again add a large handful of cabbage cut fine as for slaw, 
a half pint of tomatoes, canned or fresh ; peel and slice and add 
three large or four small onions, and two or three potatoes (some 
use a half tea-cup of dried or half pint of green com ; if dried com 
is used, it should be soaked). Let boil from half to three-quarters 
of an hour ; if you like a little thickening, stir an egg or yolk with 
a large spoonful of milk and a tea-spoon of flour, put in five or ten 
minutes before taking off; this makes it very rich. Serve with 
crackers. — Mrs. H. C Voslniry. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Three onions, three carrots, three turnips, one small cabbage, one 
pint tomatoes; chop all the vegetables except the tomatoes verj 
fine, have ready in a porcelain kettle three quarts boiling water, 
put in all except cabbage and tomatoes and simmer for half an hour, 
then add the chopped cabbage and tomatoes (the tomatoes pre- 
viously stewed), also a bunch of sweet herbs. Let soup boil for 
twenty minutes, strain through sieve, rubbing all the vegetables 
through. Take two table-spoons of best butter and one of flour 
and beat to a cream. Now pepper and salt soup to taste, and 
add a tea-spoon of white sugar, a half cup of sweet cream if you 
have it, and last stir in the butter and flour ; let it boil up and it 
is ready for the table. Serve with fried bread-chips, or poached 
eggs one in each dish. — Mrs. U. H. Herbert, Benson, 



Veal Soup. 

To about three pounds of a well-broken joint of veal, add foxn 
quarts water, and set it over to boil; prepare one-fourth pound 
macaroni by boiling it in a dish by itself with enough water to cover 
it ; add a little butter when the macaroni is tender, strain the soup 
and season to taste with salt and pepper, then add the macaroni 
with the water in which it was boiled; onions or celery may be 
added for flavoring. — Mrs. R. M. Nixon, New CasUe, 



SOUPS. 319 

Bread-dice for Soups. 

Take slices of stale bread, cut in small squares, throw in hot lard 
and fry till brown, skim out, drain, and put in the soup-tureen 
before serving the soup. Crackers crisped in the oven are nice to 
serve with oyster soup. — Mrs, V. G. H. 

Caramel for Soups. 

For caramel, put one tea-cup sugar and two teanspoons water in 
a sauce-pan over the fire, stir constantly till it is a dark color, then 
add a half tea-cup water and a pinch of salt, let boil for a few 
moments, take off, and when cold bottle. 

To brown flour, put one pint in a sauce-pan on the stove, and 
when it begins to color, stir constantly till it is a dark brown, being 
careful that it does not burn. When cold put away in a tin can 
or jar covered closely, and keep in a dry place where it is always 
ready for soups or gravies. As it requires more of this for thick- 
ening than of unbrowned flour, it may be well sometimes to take 
half of each. 

A few cloves may be stuck in the meat for soup ; or it may first 
be fried in a sauce-pan with a little butter, turning tOl brown on 
%11 sides ; or sliced onions may be iried brown and added to soup. 

TuBTiiE Soup. 

Boil a turtle very tender in five quarts of water, remove bones, 
<mt meat into small pieces ; season with a table-spoon each of mar- 
joram, sweet basil, thyme and parsley, salt and pepper to taste, 
one nutmeg beaten fine, a dozen cloves, same of allspice. Tie these 
in muslin^ remove before sending soup to table. Stir a large table- 
spoon of browned flour into a quarter pound of fresh butter, add to 
soup. Should be three quarts of soup. Fifteen minutes before 
serving add the green fiit, then add half a pint of wine, a sliced 
lemon, seeds removed, also force-meat balls ; simmer five minutes, 
take out lemon-peel, and serve* This is for a small turtle. Add 
a dioe of good ham if turtle is not fiit.

VEGETABLES. 



All vegetables are better cooked in soft water, provided it is 
dean and pure; if hard water is used, put in a small pinch of soda. 
The water should be freshly drawn, and should only be put over 
fire in time to reach the boiling point before the hour for putting 
in vegetables, as standing and long boiling frees the gases and ren- 
ders the water insipid. The fresher all vegetables are, the mpre 
wholesome. After being washed thoroughly, they should be dropped 
in cold water half an hour before using. Peel old potatoes and let 
them stand in cold water over night, or for several iiours, putting 
them in immediately after being peeled, as exposure to the air 
darkens them. Before putting on to boil, take out and wipe each 
dry with a towel. New potatoes are best baked. Full-grown, fair, 
ripe potatoes may be either boiled or baked. Medium-sized and 
smooth potatoes are best ; the kind varies with the season. Green 
corn and pease should be prepared and cooked at once. Put all 
vegetables into plenty of salted water, boiling hot (excepting egg 
plant and old potatoes, which some put on in salted cold water), and 
boil rapidly, without cover, skimming carefully until ^oroughly 
done, draining well those that require it. Onions should be soaked 
in warm salt water, to remove the rank flavor for one hour before 
cooking. Never split onions, tuniips and carrots, but slice them in 
rings cut across the fiber, as they thus cook tender much quicker. 
If the home garden fiimishes the supply of pease, spinach, green 
beans, asparagus, etc., pick them in the morning early, when th« 
dew is on, and let stand in cold water till ready for use. Some put 
salt in the water, but in that case only let them remain ten or fif«

teen minutes, unless doubts are entertained as to their freshness (if 
from the market), in which case they can remain longer, afterward 
draining them in a colander. Do not allow vegetables to remain 
in the water after they are done, but drain them in a colander and 
dress as directed in the various recipes. In preparing greens, let- 
tuce, etc., first wash them leaf by leaf in warm >vater, rather more 
than tepid, having a dish of cold water to place them in imme- 
diately. The warm water more certainly cleans the leaf and does 
not destroy the crispness if they are placed at once in cold water. 
But whether washed in warm or cold water, take them leaf by leaf, 
breaking the heads off, not cutting them. Horse-radish tops are 
considered choice for greens. Pease should not be shelled until just 
befoi-e the time of cooking. 

The proportion of salt in cooking vegetables is a heaping table- 
spoon of salt to every gallon of water. When water boils, put in 
your vegetables, and press them down with a wooden spoon. Take 
out when tender, as vegetables are spoilt by being either under or 
overdone. 

Always add both salt and a little soda to the water in which 
greens are cooked, as soda preserves color ; for the same purpose 
French cookery books recommend a small pinch of carbonate of 
ammonia. A little sugar added to turnips, beets, pease, corn, 
squash and pumpkin is an improvement, especially when the vege- 
tables are poor in quality. Sweet potatoes require a longer time to 
cook than the common variety. In gathering asparagus, never cut 
it off, but snap or break it ; in this way you do not s:et the white» 
woody part, which no boiling can make tender. Do the same with 
rhubarb, except being careful that it does not split, and take it very 
close to the ground. Put rice on to cook in boiling salted water, 
having first soaked for about an hour and dried off the surplus 
moisture on a large towel; or steam, or cook in custard-kettle. 

A piece of red pepper the size of finger-nail, dropped into meat 
of vegetables when first beginning to cook, will aid greatly in killing 
the unpleasant odor. Remember this for boiled cabbage, green 
beans, onions, mutton and chicken. All vegetables should be thor- 
oughly cooked, and require a longer time late in their season. 

Potatoes, when old, are improved by removing the skin before

baking, and either Irish or sweet potatoes, if frozen, must be puf 
in to bake without thawing. Cabbage, potatoes, carrots, turnips, 
parsnips, onions and beets are injured by being boiled with fresh 
meat, and they also injure the flavor of the meat. When vege- 
tables are to be served with salt meat, the meat should be cooked 
first and then removed, and tlie vegetables cooked in the liquor. 

Small-sized white turnips contain more nutrition than large ones, 
hut in ruta-bagas the largest are best. Potatoes vary greatly in 
quality ; varieties which are excellent early in the season lose their 
good qualities, and others, which are worthless in the fall, are 
excellent late in the spring. Those raised on gravelly or sandy soil, 
not over rich, are best. 

Old potatoes, may be greatly improved by being soaked in cold 
water several hours after peeling, or all night, being particular to 
change the water once or twice. Peel very thinly, as the best part 
of the potato is nearest the skin. Cut large potatoes, if to be steamed, 
or boiled, in four, and small ones in two pieces, and remove the core 
if defective. If to be boiled (steaming is much preferable) put 
them on in clear fresh boiling water. Keep closely covered and at 
a steady boil for at least twenty minutes, five or ten minutes more 
may be requisite, according to the quality of the potato. Watch 
carefully, and the very instant they present a mealy and broken 
surface remove them from the stove, raise the cover just enough to 
admit the draining off" of the water. This may be accomplished 
successfully and quickly, after a little practice, and is fiur better 
than turning them into a colander, thus suddenly chilling them and 
arresting the further development of the starch, which, after all, is 
the main point to be accomplished. Drain the water off thoroughly 
and quickly, sprinkle in sufficient salt for seasoning, cover the vesel 
closely, give it a shake and set back on the stove, being careful not 
to have it too hot. In a minute or so give it another shake to stir 
up the potatoes, throw in a little hot cream or rich milk with a 
lump of butter and a sprinkle of pepper, cover immediately and 
leave on the stove for another minute. This last process adds 
greatly to the good cooking of potatoes. They are ready now to 
be dished whole or mashed. Some skill is required to mash them 
properly, simple as the operation may appear. The old fashioned 



VEGETABLES. 

wood^i masher possesses advantages over the new perforated iron 
plate with handle so nearly representing the old time churn dasher. 
Mashed ^potatoes should be dipped out lightly into a hot covered 
dish and literally coaxed into a delicate mealy heap, instead of being 
stirred and patted and packed and cheesed into a shapely mass. 

If potatoes are very watery and they must be used for food, a 
small lump of lime added to the water while boiling will improv^ 
them. More so than any other vegetable does this one diifer in 
quality, according to variety and manner of culture. However the 
main crop may be raised, every farmer^s wife should secure for late 
ipring use a supply of a choice variety cultivated entirely in rotten 
wood soil, or in soil where wood ashes and gypsum are used as fer- 
tilizers. 

The great point in cooking potatoes is, to take them up as soon 
as they are done. Of course it is important to begin to cook them 
at the proper time. When boiled, baked, fried or steamed, they 
are rendered watery by continuing to cook them after they reach the 
proper point. For this reason, potatoes, to bake or boil, should 
he selected so as to have them nearly the same size. Begin with 
the largest first, and continue to select ^he largest till all are gone. 
Be careful that the water does not stop boiling, as thus the pota- 
toes will be watery. Never boil them very hard, as it breaks them. 
Medium-sized potatoes, when young, will cook in from twenty to 
thirty minutes; when old, it requires double the time. When 
peeled, they boil fifteen minutes quicker. In baking old potatoes 
with meat, now, it is better also to halve them. L^»ve them in 
the water until the meat is within half an hour of being done. See 
that the pan contains plenty of drippings, and with proper heat 
the potatoes will be brown and crisp without and white and mealy 
within. They may be fried in the meat gravy, or warmed up in 
butter for breakfast. The secret of having potatoes mealy and 
palatable is to cook them rapidly. Steam until the skin cracks, 
and a fork easily penetrates the center. If not to be served at 
once, continue steaming, as they become solid sooner than when 
boiled. 

New potatoes should always be boiled in two waters, and old 
ones are better for it. Put on two kettles of water, set potatoes 



324 



VEGETABLES. 



in one, when hot, in a wire basket, and when abont half done 
transfer to the other. 



Asparagus. 

Wash clean ; cat off the white part except a mere end, pat 
into slightly salted boiling water, boil five minntes, ponr off water, 
add more boiling hot; boil ten to fifteen minates, then pnt in a 
hmp of bntter, salt and pepper (some stir in a thickening made 
of one tea-spoon flour mixed np with cold water); cat and toast 
two or three thin slices of bread, spread with batter and pat in a 
dish, and over them tarn asparagus and gravy. The water must 
be boiled down until just enough for the gravy, which is made as 
above. Or, cut the asparagus, when boiled, into little bits, 
leaving out white end, make gravy as above, put the cut aspar- 
agus into a hot dish and turn the gravy over it and serve. 

A simple manner of boiling asparagus is to tie in a bundle, or 
Brst wrap in cotton cloth and then tie, and set upright in a sauce- 
pan containing boiling water enough to reach nearly to the tender 
tips ; boil rapidly till tender ; lay a napkin on a hot platter, take 
out asparagus, drain for a moment, place on napkin, unwrap, and 
ftld over the asparagus the corners of the napkin, and serve in this 
Ihcm, with white sauce in a gravy-boat. 

Or, boiled asparagus may be made cold in ice-box, and served 
with a sauce made of vinegar, pepper, and salt. 

Ambushed Asparagus. 
Cut off the tender tops of fifty heads of asparagus ; boil and 
drain them. Have ready as many stale biscuits or rolls as there 
are persons to be served, from which you have cut a neat top slice 
and scooped out the inside. Set them in the oven to crisp, laying 
the tops beside them, that all may dry together. Meanwhile put 
into a sauce-pan a sugarless custard made as follows: A pint or less 
of milk, and four well-whipped eggs ; boil the milk first, then beat 
in the eggs; set over the fire and stir till it thickens, when add a 
table-spoon of butter, and season with salt and pepper. Into this 
custard put the asparagus, minced fine. Do not let it boil, but 
remove from the fire as soon as the asparagus is fairly in. Fill the 



VEGETABLES. 325 

rolls with the mixture, put on the tops, fitting them carefully ; set 

in the oven three miiiytes, &^r which arrange on a dish. To be 

eaten hot. 

Eggs and Asparagus. 

Cut tender asparagus into pieces half an inch long, and boil 
twenty minutes, then drain till dry, and put into a sauce-pan con- 
taining a cup of rich drawn butter ; heat together to a boil, season 
livdth pepper and salt, and pour into a buttered dish. Break half a 
dozen ?^gs over the surface, put a bit of butter upon each, sprinkle 
with salt :;nd pepper, and put in the oven until the eggs are set. 

Fried Asparagus. 
Blanch the asparagus a couple of minutes, and then drain it; dip 
each piece in batter and fry it in hot fat. When done, sprinkle, 
with salt and serve hot. This is nice and easy to prepare. 

Boiled Dinner. 
Put meat on, after washing well, in enough boiling water to just 
cover the meat; as soo.'x as it boils, set kettle on the stove where it 
will simmer or boil very slowly ; boil until almost tender, put in 
v^etables in the following order : Cabbage cut in quarters, turnips 
of medium size cut in halves, and jx)tatoes whole, or if large cut m 
two ; peel potatoes and turnips, and allow to lie in cold water for 
half an hour before using. The meat should be well skimmed 
before adding vegetables; l)oil together until thoroughly done 
(adding a little salt before taking out of kettle), when there should 
be left only just enough water to prevent burning ; take up vege- 
tables in separate dishes, and lastly the meat ; if there is any juice 
in kettle, pour it over cabbage. Boil cabbage an hour, white tur- 
nips and potatoes half an hour, ruta-baga.s an hour and a half to 
two ^ours. A soup plate or saucer turned upside down, or a few 
iron table-spoons are u.««eful to place in bottom of kettle to keep 
meat fi'om burning. Parsnips may be substituted in place of cab- 
bage and tuniips, cooking them three-quarters of an hour. 

BEFfS. 

Remove leaves, wash clean, being careftil not to break off the 
little fibers and rootlets, a*? the juices would thereby escape and they 
would lose their color ; boil in plenty of water, if young, two hours, 



326 VEGETABLES. 

if old, four or five hours, trying with a fork to see when tender ; 
take out, drop in a pan of cold water, and slip off the skin with the 
hands; slice those needed for immediate use, place in a dish, add 
salt, pepper, hutter, and if not very sweet a tea-spoon sugar, set 
over boiling water to heat thoroughly, and serve hot with or with- 
out vinegar; put those which remain into a stone jar whole, cover 
with vinegar, keep in a cool place, take out as wanted, slice and 
serve. A few pieces of horse-radish put into the jar will prevent 
a white scum on the vinegar. .Or, roast in hot ashes, or bake in 
oven, (turning often in the pan with a knife, as a fork causes the 
juice to flow), and when tender, peel, slice, and dress with salt, 
pepper, butter and vinegar. Or, after beets are boiled and skinned, 
mash together with boiled potatoes, and season to the taste with 
salt ; add a large lump of butter (do not use any milk) ; place in 
a dish, make a hole in center in which put ni a generous lump 
of butter; sprinkle with pepper and serve at once. This is a New 
England dish, and very delicious for harvest time, when beets are 
young and sweet. 

Beet Greens. 

* Wash young beets very clean, cut off tips of leaves, looking over 
carefully to see that no bugs or worms remain, but do not separate 
roots from leaves ; fill dinner-pot half full of salted boiling water, 
add beets, boil from half to three-quarters of an hour ; take out 
and drain in colander, pressing down with a large spoon, so as to 
get out all the water. Dish and dress with butter, pepper, and salt 
if needed. Serve hot with vinegar. 

Butter Beans. 

With a knife cut off the ends of pods and strings from both sides, 
being very careful to remove every shred ; out every bean length- 
wise, in two or thi-ee strips, and leave them for half an hour in 
cold water. Much more than cover them with boiling water; boil 
till perfectly tender. It is well to allow three hours for boiling. 
Drain well, return to kettle, and add a dressing of half a gill cream, 
one and a half ounces butter, one even tea-spoon salt, and half a 
tea-spoon pepper. This is sufficient for a quart of cooked beans. 



VEGETABLES. 327 

Dry Lima Beans. 
Wash one quart of dry lima beans in two warm waters, soak 
three hours, drain, and put on to cook in enough boiling water to 
cover them; cover pot with tin lid, addiug more hot water as it 
boils away, boiling nipicJly for one and a half hours, when there 
should be only water enough to come up to top of the beans— just 
sufficient to make a nice dressing. Five minutes before taking up, 
season with salt and pepper, and stir in a dressing made of one table- 
spoon each of flour and butter, rubbed together until smooth. This 
is a delicious dish. 

String Beans. 

String, snap and wash two quarts beans, boil in plenty of water 
about fifteen minutes, drain off and put on again in about two 
quarts boiling water; boil an hour and a half, and add salt and 
pepper just before taking up, stirring in one and a half table-spoons 
butter rubbed into two table-spoons flour and half pint sweet cream. 
Or, boil a piece of salted pork one hour, then add beans and boil 
an hour and a half. For shelled beans boil half an hour in water 
enough to cover, and dress as above. 

Stp:wed Carrots. 

Take any quantity desired, divide the carrots lengthwise, and boil 
until perfectly tender, which will require from one to two hours. 
When done, have ready a sauco-j)an with one or two table-spoons 
butter, and small cup cream ; slice the carrot,s very thin, and put in 
the sauce-pan ;• add salt and peppei-, and let stew ten or fifteer 
minutes, stirring gently once or twice, and serve in a vegetable 
dish. Some add more milk or cream ; when done, skim out car- 
rots, and to the cream add a little flour thickening, or the beaten 
yolks of one or two eggs. When it boils, pour over the carrots and 
serve. Carrots may also be boiled with meat like turnips or pars* 
nips, but they take longer to cook than either.— ifr«. C T, C. 

Boiled Corn. 

Put the well-cleaned ears in salted boiling water, boil an hour, or 
boil in the husk for the same time, remove husks and serve imme- 
diately. Com thoroughly cooked is a wholesome dish. 



828 VEGETABLES, 

Stowed Corn. 
Cut with a sharp knife through the center of every row of 
grains, and cut off the outer edge ; then with the back of the blade 
push out the yellow eye, with the rich, creamy center of the grain, 
leaving the hull on the cob. To one quart of this add half a pint 
rich milk, and stew until cooked in a covered tin pail, in a kettle 
one-third full of boiling water ; then add salt, white pepper, and two 
or three ounces butter ; allow two hours for cooking; it seems a long 
time, but there is no danger of burning, and it requires no more at- 
tention than to stir it occasionally and to keep good the supply of 
water. If drier than Jiked, add more milk or cream. Or, after 
cutting com from the cob, boil the cobs ten or fifteen minutes and 
take out and put corn in same water ; when tender, add a dressing 
of milk, butter, pepper and salt, and just before serving, stir in 
beaten eggs, allowing three eggs to a dozen ears of corn. 

Bina's Stewed Corn. 
Shave corn off the ear, being careful not to cut into the cob; to 
three pints corn add three table-spoons butter, pepper and salt, and 
just enough water to cover j place in a skillet, cover and cook 
Father slowly with not too hot a fire, from half to three-quarters 
of an hour, stir with a spoon often, and if necessary add more 
water, for the corn must not brown; if desired, a few moments 
before it is done, add half cup sweet cream thickened with tea- 
spoon flour; boil well and serve with roast beef, escaloped toma- 
toes and mashed potatoes. Some stew tomatoes, and just before 
serving mix tiiem with the corn. 

Dried Corn. 
For a family of eii^ht, wash a pint of corn through one water, 
•\'aA put to soak over night in clenn cold water (if impossible to 
soak so long, place over a kettle of hot water for two or three 
hours) ; when softened, cook fiwo^ to ten minutes in water in which 
it was soaked, adding as soon as boiling, two tablo-s|X)ons butter, 
one of flour, and a little salt and pepper. Another good way to 
finish is the following: Take the yolk of one egg, one table-spoon 
milk, pinch of salt, thicken with flour quite stiff so as to take out 
with a tea-spoon, and drop in little dumplings not hirgor than au 



VEGETABLES. .329 

acorn; cover tightly and cook five or ten minutes; have enough 
water in kettle before adding dumplings, as cover should not be re- 
moved until dumplings are done. 

Hominy. 

Soak one quart of ground hominy over night, put over the fire 

in a tin pail, set in boiling water with water enough to cover, boil 

gently for five hours, as it can not be hurried. After the grains 

begin to soften on no account stir it. The water put in at fir.-t 

ought to be enough to finish it, but if it proves too little, add more 

careftilly, as too much makes it sloppy. Salt just before taking 

from the stove, as too early salting makes it dark. If properly 

done, the grains will stand out snowy and well done, but round and 

separate. 

Preserved Corn. 

Scald corn just enough to set the milk, cut from cob, to every 
four pints of corn add one pint salt, mix thoroughly, pack in jars, 
with a cloth and weight over corn ; when wanted for use put in a 
stew-pan or kettle, cover with cold water; as soon as it comes to a 
boil pour ofi* and put on cold again, and repeat until it is fresh 
enough for taste, then add a very little sugar, sweet cream, or but- 
ter, etc., to suit taste. — Mrs, S, M. Guy. 

Green Corn Pudding. 
Draw a sharp knife through each row of corn lengthwise, thea 
scrape out the pulp; to one pint of the corn add one quart of milk, 
three eggs, a little suet, sugar to taste, and a few lumps of butter ; 
stir it occasionally until thick, and bake about two hours. 

Boiled Cauliflower. 
To each half gallon water allow heaped table-spoon salt ; choose 
dose and white cauliflower, trim oflT decayed outside leaves, and cut 
stock off flat at bottom ; open flower a little in places to remove 
insects which generally are found about the stalk, and let cauli- 
flowers lie with heads downward in salt and water for two hours 
previous to dressing them, which will effectually draw out all ver- 
min. Then put into boiling water, adding salt in above propor- 
tion, and boil briskly for fifteen or twenty minutes over a good fire, 
keeping the sauce-pan uncovered. The water should be well

skimmod. When cauliflowers are tender, take up, drain, and if 
large enough, place upright in dish ; serve with plain melted bijtter, 
a little of which may be poured over the flowers, or a white sauce 
may be used made as follows : 

Put butter size of an e^g into the sauce-pan, and when it bubbles 
stir in a scant half tea-cup of flour ; stir well with an egg-whisk 
until cooked ; then add two tea-cups of thin cream, some pepper 
and salt. Stir it over the fire until perfectly smooth. Pour the 
sauce over the cauliflower and serve. Many let the cauliflower 
simmer in the sauce a few moments before serving. Cauliflower is 
delicious served as a garnish around spring chicken^ or with fried 
sweet-breads, when the white sauce should be poured over both. 
In this case it should be made by adding the cream, flour, and sea- 
soning to the little grease (half a tea-spoon) tliat is left after fiy- 
ing the chickens or sweet-breads. — Mn, W. P. Andemm. 

ESCALOPED ("AULIFLOWER. 

Boil till very tender, drain well and cut in small pieces; 
put it in layers with fine chopped egg and this dressing: half 
pint of milk thickened over boiling water, with two table-spoons 
of flour and seasoned with two tea-spoons of salt; one of white 
pepper and two ounces of butter; put grated bread over the 
top, dot it with small bits of butter, and place it in the oven to 
beat thoroughly and brown. Serve in same dish in which it was 
baked. This is a good way to use common heads. A nicer way is 
to boil them, then place them whole in a buttered dish with stems 
down. Make a sauce with a cup of bread-crumbs beaten to froth 
with two table-spoons of melted butter and three of cream or milk, 
one well-beaten egg and salt and pepper to taste. Pour this over 
the cauliflower, cover the dish tightly and bake six minutes in a 
quick oven, browning them nicely. Serve as above. 

HEmELBERG CaBBAGE. 

Select two small, solid heads of hard red cabbage ; divide them 
in halves from crown to stem ; lay the split side down, and cut 
downwards in thin slices. The cabbage will then be in narrow strips 
or shreds. Put into a sauoe-pan a table-spoon of clean drippings, 
batter or any nice &t ; when fat is hot, put in cabbage a tea-spoon 
of adti three tablespoons vin^^ar (if the latter is very strong, use 



VEGETABLES. 331 

but two), and one onion , in which three or four cloves have been 
stuck, buried in the middle ; boil two hours and a haff ; if it 
becomes too dry and is in danger of scorching, add a very little 
water. This is very nice, — Mrs. L, S. WUlisixyn, Heidelberg^ Germany. 

Cr£am£d Cabbage. 
Slice as for cold slaw and stew in a covered sauce-pan till ten- 
der ; drain it, return to sauce-pan, add a gill or more of rich cream, 
one ounce of butter, pepper and salt to taste ; let simmer two or 
three minutes, then serve. Milk may be used by adding a little 
more butter ; or have^a deep spider hot, put in sliced cabbage, pour 
quickly over it a pint of boiling water, cover close and cook for ten 
minutes, then pour off water and add half pint of rich milk. When 
the milk boils, stir in a tea-spoon of flour moistened with a little 
milk, season, cook a moment, serve. 

Delicate Cabbage. 
Remove all defective leaves, quarter and cut as for coarse 

slaw, cover well with cold water, and let remain several hours 

before cooking, then drain and put into pot with enough boiling 

water to cover ; boil until thoroughly cooked (which will generally 

require about forty-five minutes), add salt ten or fifteen minutes 

before removing from fire, and when done, take up into a colander, 

press out the water well, and season with butter and j>epper. This 

is a good dish to serve with corned meats, but should not be cooked 

with 'them; if preferred, however, it may be seasoned by adding 

some of the liquor and fat from the boiling meat to the cabbage 

while cooking. Or, cut the cabbage in two, remove the hard stock, 

let stand in cold water two hours, tie in thin netting or piece of 

muslin, and boil in salted water for a longer time than when it is 

cut finely. Drain, remove, and serve in a dish with drawn butter 

or a cream dres«siug poured over it. — Mrs. E, T. Carson. 

Fried Cabbage. 
Cut the cabbage very fine, on a slaw cutter, if possible ; salt and 
pepper, stir well, and let stand fiwe minutes. Have an iron kettle 
smoking hot, drop one table-spoon lard into it, then the cabbage, 
stirring briskly until quite tender; send to table immediately. 
One half cup sweet cream, and three table-spoons vinegar— the 
vinegar added after the cream has been well stirred, and after taken 



332 VEGETABLES, 

from the stove, is an agreeable change. When properly done an 
invalid can eat it without injury, and there is no offensive odor 
from cooking. — Mrs. J, T, Liggett, Detroit, Mkh. 

Southern Cabbage. 
Chop or slice one medium-sized cabbage fine, put it in a stew' 
pan with boiling water to well cover it, and boil fifleen minutes ; 
drain off all water, and add a dressing made as follows: Half tea- 
cup wine-vinegar, two-thirds as much sugar, salt, pepper, half tea- 
spoon mustard, and two tea-spoons salad oil; when this is boiling 
hot, add one tea-cup cream, and one egg stirred together ; mix 
thoroughly and immediately with the cabbage, and cook a moment. 
Serve hot. — Mrs. P. T. Morey, Charleston, S. G. 

Stuffed Cabbage. 
Take a large, fresh cabbage anl cut out heart ; fill vacancy with 
stuffing made of cooked chicken or veal, chopped very fine and 
highly seasoned and rolled into balls with yolk of egg. Then tie 
cabbage firmly together (some tie a cloth around it), and boil in a 
covered kettle two hours. This is a delicious dish and is useM in 
using up cold meats. — Mrs. W. A. Croffut, New York Oity, 

Dandelions. 
They are fit for use until they blossom. Cut off the leaves, pick 
over carefully, wash in several waters, put into boiling water, boil 
one hour, drain well, add salted boiling water, and boil two hours ; 
when done, turn into a colander and drain, season with butter, and 
more sajt if needed, and cut with a knife ; or boil with a piece of 
salt pork, omitting the butter in the dressing. 

Egg Plant. 
Peel and cut in- slices the purple kind, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and let drain on a tipped plate for three-quarters of an 
hour ; make a light batter with one egg, fiour and a little water, 
dip the slices into it and fry in butter or lard. Eggs and cracker 
may be used instead of the batter. Or, peel the egg-plant, boil till

salt to taste, put in a shallow pudding-pan, and over the top place 
a thick layer of crushed cracker. Bake half an hour in a moder- 
ate oven.

Egg Plant. 
Peel and slice one or two medium-sized egg-p]ants, put on in cold 
water, boil till tender, drain, mash fine, season with salt and pepper, 
and add a beaten egg and a table-spoon of flour ; fry in little cakes 
in. butter or butter and lard in equal parts; or cut in slices, lay in 
cold well-salted water for an hour or two, roll in egg and cracker 
crumbs, and fry with a little butter. Parsnips and salsify or oyster- 
plant may be cooked in the same way, but the oyster-plant is made 
in smaller cakes to imitate oysters. 

Wilted Lettuce. 
Place in a vegetable dish lettuce that has been very carefully 
picked and washed each leaf by itself, to remove all insects. Cut 
across the dish four or five times, nnd sprinkle with salt. Fry a 
small piece of fat ham until brown, cut it in small pieces; when 
very hot add cup of good vinegar, and pour it boiling hot over the 
lettuce; mix it well with a fork, and garnish with slices of hard* 
boiled eggs. Be certain to have the fat so hot that when vinegars is 
poured in, it will boil immediately. Add half a cup or a cup of 
vinegar according to strength of vinegar and quantity of lettuce. 

Baked Macaroni. 

Take about three ounces macaroni and boil till tender in a stew* 

pan with a little water ; take a pudding dish or pan, warm a little 

butter in it, and put in a layer of macaroni, then a layer of cheese 

grated or cut in small bits, and sprinkle over with salt, pepper 

and small pieces of butter, then add another layer of macaroni, 

and so on, finishing off with cheese; pour on rich milk or cream 

enough to just come to the top of the ingredients, and bake from 

one-half to three quarters of an hour. Rice may be used instead 

of macaroni by first cooking as follows : Pick and wash a cup of rice, 

put in a stew-kettle with three cups boiling water, and set over the 

fire^the boiling water makes the kernels retain their shape better 

than when cold water is used. When done put a layer of rice, 

cheese, etc., alternately as you would macaroni, and bake in the 

same way. 

Boiled Macaroni. 

Pour one pint boiling water over five ounces macaroni, let stand 

half an hour, drain and put in a custard-ketde with boiling milk or

milk and water to cover, cook till tender, drain, add a table-spoon 
butter, and a tea-cup cream, and season with salt and pepper ; grate 
cheese over the top and serve. — Mrs. S. B. T. 

Macaroni with Tomatoes. 
Take three pints of beef soup, clear, and put one pound of maca- 
roni in it, boil fifteen minutes, with a little salt ; then take up the 
macaroni — which should have absorbed nearly all the liquid — and 
put it on a flat plate, and sprinkle grated cheese over it thickly, 
and pour over all pleiuifully a sauce made of tomatoes, well boiled, 
strained, and seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Itauan Macaroni. 
Place two pounds of beef, well larded with strips of salt pork, 
and one or two chopped onions, in a covered kettle on the back of 
the stove, until it throws out its juice and is a rich brown ; add a 
quart of tomatoes seasoned with pepper and salt, and allow the 
mixture to simmer for two or three hours. Take the quantity of 
macaroni desired and boil in water for twenty minutes, after which 
put one layer of the boiled macaroni in the bottom of a pudding 
dish, cover with some of the above mixture, then a layer of grated 
cheese, and so on in layers till the dish is filled, having a layer of 
cheese on the top ; place in the oven an hour, or until it is a rich 
browiL Commence early in the morning to prepare this dish. 

Boiled Okra. 
Put the young and tender pods of long, white okra in salted boil 
ing water in a porcelain or tin-lined sauce-pan (as iron discolors it), 
boil fifteen minutes, take off stems, and serve with butter, pepper, 
mlt, and vinegar if preferred ; or, after boiling, slice in rings, sea- 
son with butter, dip in batter and fry ; season and serve, or stew an 
equal quantity of tomatoes, and tender sliced okra, and one or two 
sliced groen peppers; stew in porcelain kettle fifteen or twenty 
minutes, season with butter, pepper and salt, and serve. — Miss M, 
E. W., Selvfuiy Ala. 

Baked Onions. 

The large Spanish or Bermuda onions are best for this purpose. 
Wash the outside clean, put into a sauce-pan with slightly salted 



VEGETABLES, 335 

water, and boil an hour, replenishing the water with more (boiling 
fact J as it boils away. Then turn off watc^r ; take out onions and 
lay upon a cloth that all moisture may be absorl^ed ; roll each in a 
piece of buttered tissue-paper, twisting it at the top to keep it 
closed, and bake in a slow oven nearly an hour, or until tender all 
through. Peel, put in a deep dish, and brown slightly, basting 
freely with butter ; this will take fifteen minutes more. Season with 
pepper and salt, and pour melted butter over the top. 

BoiLKD OR Fried Onions. 
Wash and peel, boil ten minutes, pour off this water, again add 
boiling water, boil a few minutes and drain a second time; pour on 
boiling water, add salt and boil for one hour; place in a colander, turn 
a saucer over them, and press firmly to drive off all the water; place 
in a dish and add butter and pepper. Or, about half an hour before 
they are done, turn a pint of milk into the water in which they are 
boiling, and, when tender, season as above. Old onions require two 
hours to boil. To fry onions, slice and boil ten minutes each time 
in three waters, drain, fry in butter or beef drippings, stir often, 
season, and serve hot. 

Potatoes Boiled or Baked in Jackets. 
Wash clean (a brush is the best implement for cleaning potatoes), 
cut off the ends, let stand in cold water a few hours, put into boil- 
ing water, the larger ones first, and then in a short time adding the 
rest, cover, and keep boiling constantly ; after fifteen minutes throw 
in another handful of salt and boil another fifteen minutes; try with 
a fork, and if it does not quite run through the potato, they are 
done (this is called ** leaving a bone in them"). Drain, take to 
door or window and shake in open air to make them mealy; re- 
turn to stove and allow to stand uncovered for a moment. Or, 
when washed, bake in a moderate oven fifty minutes; or, place in 
a steamer half an hour over water kept constantly boiling, serve 
inmediately ; or, wash and peel medium -sized ones, and bake in 
pan with roast meat, basting oftien with the drippings. 

Breakfast Potatoes. 
Peel, cut in very thin slices into a very little boiling water»

BO little that it will be evaporated when they are cooked, add salt 
to taste, some cream, or a very lUUe milk and a bit of butter. A 
little practice will make this a favorite dish in any family. The 
art is, to cook the potatoes with a very little water, so that it will 
be evaporated at the time the potatoes are done. They must be 
stirred occasionally while cooking. 

POTATOICS AND OnIONS. 

Boil potatoes in skins, peel while hot and slice ; about an hour 
before wanted, slice onions, and let stand in salt and water; while 
peeling potatoes, put. onions in skillet with a little ham gravy or 
butter and a little water, and cook slightly ; take out, put in vege- 
table dish a layer of onions, then potatoes, then onions, etc., with 
potatoes last ; add a cup of vinegar to skillet (with ham gravy or 
butter), warm and .pour over. 

Fried Raw Potatoes. 
Wash, peel, and slice in cold water, drain in a colander, and drop 
in a skillet prepared with two table-spoons melted butter or beef- 
drippings, or one-half of each ; keep closely covered for ten minutes, 
only removing to stir with a knife from the bottom to prevent 
burning ; cook another ten minutes, stirring frequently until done 
and lightly browned. Sweet potatoes are nice prepared in the same 
manner. — Mrs. M. E. Soidhard, 

Fried Whole Potatoes. 

Peel and boil in salted water, remove from the fire as soon as 

done so that they may remain whole ; have ready one beaten egg, 

and some rolled crackers or bread-crumbs ; first roll the potatoes in 

the eggf and then in the crackers, and fry in butter till a light 

brown, or drop in boiling lard. This is a nice way to cook old 

potatoes. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Pare and boil till done, drain, and mash in the kettle until per- 
fectly smooth; add milk or cream, and butter and salt; beat like 
cake with a large spoon, and the more they are beaten the nicer 
they become. Put in a dish, smooth, place a lump of butter in the 
center, sprinkle with pepper ; or add one or two eggs well-beaten, 
pepper, mix thoroughly, put in baking dish, dip a knife in sweet

oveu twenty minutes. To warm over mashed potatoes, season with 
salt and butter, and a little cream or milk, place in a buttered pie- 
pan, smoothing and shaping the top handsomely, and making checks 
with a knife ; brown in a stove or range oven ; place tin on a second 
dish and serve on it. Or, add a little cream or milk to cold mashed 
potatoes, press evenly in a basin, set away, and in the morning slice 
and fiy. 

New Potatoes. 

Wash, scrape, boil ten muiutes, turn off water, and add enough 
m6Te, boiling hot, to cover, also add a little salt; cook a few 
moments, drain, and set again on stove, add butter, salt, and pepper 
and a little thickening made of two table-spoons flour in about a 
pint of milk (a few small ones may be left in the kettle, and 
broken, not mashed with the potato-masher), put on the cover, and, 
when the milk has boiled, pour over potatoes and serve. Or, when 
cooked and drained, put in a skillet with hot drippings, cover, and 
shake till a nice brown. 

Potatoes in Jackets. 

Bake as many potatoes as are needed ; when done, take off a 
little piece from one end to permit them to stand, from the other 
end cut a large piece, remove careinlly the inside, and rub through 
a fine sieve, or mash thoroughly ; put on the fire with half an ounce 
of butter and one ounce of grated cheese to every four fair-sized 
potatoes; and add boiling milk and pepper and salt as for mashed 
potatoes; fill the potato shells, and sprinkle over mixed bread-crumbs 
and grated cheese; and put in hot oven and brown. Many prefer 
to omit cheese and bread-crumbs, filling the shells heaping full and 
then browning. 

Potatoes in Kentucky Style. 

Slice thin as for fiying, let remain in cold water half an hour ; 

put into pudding-dish or dripping-pan, with salt, pepper, and some 

milk — about half a pint to an ordinary dish ; put into oven and 

hake for an hour ; take out and add a lump of butter half the size 

of an eggf cut into small bits and scattered over the top. Blicing

where potatoes are (doubtful, though poor ones are not of necesflily 
required. Soaking in cold water hardens the slices, so that they 
will hold their shape. The milk serves to cook them through, and 
to make a nice brown on the top; the quantity can only b& learned 
by experience ; if just a little is left as a rich gravy, moistening all 
the slices, then it is right. In a year of small and poor potatoes, 
this method of serving them will be very welcome to many a house- 
keeper. — Mrs, G, M. NicIwlSj Springfidil. 

Potatoes a la Parisienne. 
Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse cloth (avoid scraping 
if possible), drop into boiling water, boil briskly until done, taking 
care not to over do (if doubtful on this point. press one of the potatoes 
with a fork against the side of the sauce-pan, if done it will yield 
to a gentle pressure). Have ready, in a sauce-pan, some cream and 
butter hot, but not boiling, a little green parsley, pepper and salt ; 
pour off the water from the potatoes and add the cream and butter, 
let stand a minute or two over hot water, and serve. 

Potato Souffle 

Boil four good-sized mealy potatoes, pass them through a sieve ; 
scald in a clean sauce-pan half tea-cup of sweet milk and table- 
spoon of good butter, add to the potato with' a little salt and pepper, 
and beat to a cream ; add one at a time, the yolks of four eggs, 
beating thoroughly, drop a small pinch of salt into the whites and 
beat them to a stiff froth, add them to the mixture, beating as little 
as possible; have ready a well-buttered baking-dish, large enough 
to permit the souffle to rise without running over; bake twenty 
minutes in a brisk oven, serve at once, and in the same dish in 
which it was baked. It should be eaten with meats that have 
gravies.

Baked Parsnips. 
Put four thin slices salt pork in a kettle with two quarts cold 
water, wash and scrape parsnips, and if large halve or quarter, and 
as soon as water boils place in kettle, boil about half an hour, re- 
move meat, parsnips, and gravy to a dripping-pan, sprinkle with a 
little white sugar, and bake in oven a quarter of an hour, or until 
they are a light brown, and the water is all fried out Add a few 
potatoes if liked. Those left over, fried in a hot skillet, with but- 
ter, ham &t or beef drippings, make a nice breakfast dish. It is 
better to dip each slice in a beaten egg before frying. Parsnips are 
good in March or April, and make an excellent seasoning for soups. 

Stewed Parsnips. 
Wash, scrape, and slice about half, an inch thick; have a skiUet 
prepared with a half pint hot water and a table-spoon butter, add 
the parsnips, season with salt and pepper, cover closely, and stew 
until the water is cooked away, stirring occasionally to prevent burn- 
ing. When done, the parsnips will be of a creamy, light brown 

color. — Mre, D. B. 

Green Pease. 

Wash lightly two quarts shelled pease, put into boiling water

How TO Boil Rice. 
Bice should be carefully picked over, washed in warm water, 

rubbed between the hands, and then rinsed several times in cold 

water till white. Put one tea-cupful in a tin pan or porcelain kettle, 

add one quart boiling water; boil fifteen minutes, not stirring, but 

taking care that it does not burn ; add one tea-spoon salt, pour into 

a dish and send to table, placing a lump of butter in the center. 

Cooked thus the kernels remain whole. 

To boil rice in milk, put a pint rice into nearly two quarts of cold 
milk an hour before dinner, add two tea-spoons salt, boil very slowly 
and stir often ; cook on back part of stove or range so as to avoid 
burning, and take it up into a mold or bowl wet in cold water a short 
time before serving. 

Or, after cooking, drain carefully, stir in two well-beaten eggs, one 

table-spoon grated cheese; half a table-spoon butter, half a tea-spoon 

salt ; bake a few minutes in shallow pans. Some soak rice an hour 

or two before cooking. 

Southern Rice. 

After thoroughly washing and rubbing the rice, put it in salted 
water enough to cover it twice over, in a custard-kettle, or tin pail 
set in a kettle of boiling water ; cover the whole closely for fifteen 
or twenty minutes, until the grains of rice are full and plump but 
not ** mushy;" drain off all the water possible, and replace rice in 
the kettle, allowing it to cook for half an hour longer, when it is 
ready to serve. The grains should be full and soft, and each one 
retain its form perfectly. During the last half hour it should be 
occasionally stirred lightly with a fork, and it is improved by stand- 
ing on the back of the stove a few minutes before serving. — Mrs, P.

with a piece of salt codfish for seasoning. Before sending to table, 
remove codfish, thicken with flour and butter rubbed together, toast 
slices of bread, put in dish, and then add the vegetable oyster. 
This method gives the flavor of oysters to the vegetable, and adds 
much to its delicacy. Or, after stewing until tender in clear water,

half milk and water, season and serve with crackers like oyster 
soup. 

Cym LINGS OR Summer Squash. 

These are better when young and tender, which may be known 
by pressing the nail through the skin ; do not peel or take out 
seeds, but boil whole, or cut across in thick slices ; boil in as little 
water as possible for one-half or three-quarters of an hour, drain 
well, mash and set on back part of stove or range to dry out for 
ten or fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally ; then season with butter 
pepper, salt and a little cream. If old, peel, cut up, take out seeds, 
boil and season as above.

ORNAMENTAL ICING. 



BY PROF. C. H. KING. 

Ornamental icing consists in working two or more colors of icing 
on one surface, — such, for instance, as pink and white, or choco- 
late and white, sometimes with, sometimes without, the addition of 
crystallizing. To ic^ a cake white and pipe or ornament it with 
pink piperj, or ice it with pink or chocolate icing and pipe it with 
white icing, would constitute ornamental icing. But there is 
another method called " inlaid," which consists of having different 
colored icing on the same surface, not simply a different colored 
piping on the icing. The best illustration I can give of this wiU, I 
think, be a chess-board. To do it take a cone, cut a fine point off^ 
fill it as instructed in ** artistic piping," draw fine lines first 
straight down one inch apart, then across at the same distance at 
right angles ; you have then formed squares one inch across. Now 
fill these in alternately with either white or pink and white, and 
then chocolate icing or pink and chocolate. You then have the 
squares in two colors, the same as they would appear on a chess or 
checker-board. The only point to be here observed is to have your 
icing soft enough to just run smooth ; the lines will prevent it from 
running together. You can work any pattern you choose in this 
manner by simply running a line of piping to form the design, then 
tilling in as before described. You can also further vary this by 
marking out any design, and with a small paint-brush washing it 
over with white of egg or gum-water, then covering it with granu- 
lated sugar either plain white or colored ; or you can cover it with 
powdered chocolate or rolled rock candy, either pink or white; shake 
off what will not stick, and you will find the design covered with 
the sugar; now pipe round the edge of the design with a fine cone 
of icing sugar, and it is complete.

Crystallization. 

CrystaUization consists in simply covering the cake while the 
icing is wet with granulated sugar, plain or pink. (For coloring 
sugar pink see ** meringue icing "). Or you can use pink or white 
sugar or rock candy crushed. If you wish to crystallize only a 
portion of the icing, and that in any particular design, first allow 
the icing to dry, then wash the part you wish crystallized with white 
of egg or gum- water, and cover it with the sugar; then shake off 
what will not remain on. 

Artistic Piping, with Diagrams. 

For the benefit of those who wish to excel in the art of orna- 
menting bride or other cakes with icing (technically called '*pip- 
ing,'') I give a sheet of diagrams, which will almost explain them- 
selves, and will require but little study by those having a taste for 
artistic work (which most ladies have) to master it; and I promise 
you that if you will master this sheet of diagrams before attempting 
any thing more elaborate (on the same principle as you first perfect 
yourself in the scales for music before attempting the playing of a 
piece), that you will succeed beyond your expectations, and will 
soon be able to ornament a cake equal to an expert. I would 
here remark that this applies to all kinds of ornamenting, as it is 
all done in the same manner, no matter whether the material used 
be butter, lard, or savory jelly for the decoration of tongues, roast 
chicken, hams, etc. , or sweet jelly, chocolate or sugar for the oma- 
tnentation of all kinds of cakes. Learn one, and you have learned 
all. 

For example, if you wish' to decorate a tongue, ham, or roast 
chicken, use either butter, lard, or savory jelly, instead of sugar, 
and in precisely the same manner as you would icing. This orna- 
mentation, with the addition of a little parsley, and a cut root 
flower or so, completes the operation of decorating the above-named 
articles. They are sometimes further, or even altogether decorated 
or gamishe<l with '^tippets," cut diamond or triangular form, and 
consisting of toasted bread, ** aspic" jelly, etc.; but this style of 
garnishing is usually adopted only by those who are not competent 



348 



ORNAMENTAL ICINO. 



to decorate or giimish with butter, lard, or savory jelly, and who 
are not able to cut their own root flowers. Root flowers are usually 
cut ill the form of roses, tulips, dahlias, et<.\, from white and yellow 
turnips, beets, and carrots, and the edges of the leaves are usually 
tipped with pink color, such as liquid ** cochineal." 

To use jelly for decorating or piping cakes, set it in a place 
where it will get just warm enough to pass through the cone with 
'lit;? aid of a gentle pressure; in cold weather it is well to beat it 
with a t^poon, in addition to warming it. Thi^ makes it one uniform 
consistency. When ready for use fill the cone with it, then pro- 
ceed as directed for piping, using the cone in the same manner as 
if it contained icing. 

To use butter or lard treat it in the same manner as jelly, so as 
to get it just soft enough to pass through the cone. Be very careful 
not to get it too soft or it will not stand. In warm weather you can 
add a little flour to stiflen it, but not too much, or it will not pass 
through the cone; when ready fill cone with it, same as for icing, 
and use the cone in the same manner. 

To cut root flowers, wash the roots, and for say a rose, take a good 
shaped turnip, pare it, cut it the proper shape, then with a sharp 
pocket knife (French root flower cutters may be had of dealers 
in confectioner's supplies,) go all round the bottom edge, so ^^z-n/-^ ; 
then repeat this op)eration, so .-oOs, bringing the second cuts be- 
tween the first, and holding the back of the knife blade from you 
and the edge towards you. This causes the cuts to meet at the 
bottom, and then by holding the knife point down, and running it 
all round inside the cut the piece falls out, leaving the leaves 
separate and distinct. Continue this until you reach the center, 
eo ^-<><>Ck. A little practice will assist you in this particular, and 
>'ou will soon be able to make other flowers, as the principle is the 
same; when the flowers are cut tip the edges with a little -cochineal. 

To ornament a cake with icing, use prepared icing in the manner 
I shall hereafter describe. The icing may be harmlessly colored, 
as follows: for pink, use ** cochineal;" for blue, use indigo; for yel- 
low, use saflron ; for green, use blue and yellow, until you attain 
the required shade of color. 

Although I have given the different colors, should you wish to 



ORNAMENTAL ICING. • 349 

use them, I would not recommend them except in cases where their 
use is required to produce effect, and not to be eaten. Too much 
color, or too great a number of colors, are objectionable and 
not in good taste. I suggest keeping as much as possible to plain 
white, light pink, light ci*eam color, chocolate color, produced by the 
use of chocolate or cocoa, and the natural colors produced by the 
use of the various sweet jellies. By a judicious and artistic arrange- 
ment of the colors the above articles will give, it is possible to 
produce an unlimited variety, and not place any thing before 
guests objectionable in point of color. 

The sugar used for decorating cakes is prepared in the same man- 
ner as that for icing cake (see icing for cakes.) To use it, have 
ready prepared some paper cones, made by folding or rolling up a 
piece of paper in the form of a cornet, and securing the joint with a 
little mucilage or white of eggs (see No. 1, in page of diagrams). 
Now with a sharp knife cut off the point of cone so as to leave hole 
any size needed, from a pin's size to half an inch in diameter (see 
No. 2, for plain round work). If you wish a star (No. 3), cut off 
the point of the cone to form an aperture equal to the center of 
the star you require, then cut out the points, as shown in No. 22. 
If for a leaf, cut as shown in No. 24. Now fill these cones three- 
fourths full with the prepared icing, fold down the top securely, so 
that the sugar will not force back, and all is ready to commence the 
omamentatioi^. (I would here say that it will save the trouble of 
cutting the cones to use little brass tubes, made for the purpose, al 
a cost of from ten to fifteen cents each. In using these you have 
only to cut off the point of the paper cone large enough to allow the 
tube to come through half its length. These tubes will last a life- 
time, and can be procured from almost any confectioner's supply 
store.) 

The cones being filled with the sugar, and the cake ready iced, 
mark out (as lightly as possible) with a lead-pencil the design on the 
cake; then go over the design with the cones of sugar, in the man* 
ner hereafter described, until the design is complete. (I say this^ 
presuming you have mastered the diagrams.) I will now explain 
the diagrams, and in so doing hope I shall succeed in making yoa 
fully understand the use and purposes of the cones, and the varioot 



850 



ORNAMENTAL lOINO. 



yet simple ** means to the end," that you may be able to so 

the various diagrams as to form a harmonious whole, and surprise 

yourself by producing a design beyond your expectations. 

To practice this, I would recommend that you procure a walnut 
board, about twelve inches square, perfectly smooth. This being 
dark and the sugar white you can easily see the work; and if every 
thing is clean the sugar need not be wasted, as it can be scraped off 
and used for some purpose or other. 

The board being ready and a cone filled with sugar, take the cone 
in the left hand, and place the thumb of the right hand on the folded 
part or top ; use the thumb to press on the cone to force out the 
sugar at the point, in just the same manner you would use a syringe. 
Now force out the sugar with a regular and even pressure, and 
draw a number of fine lines, as even and straight as possible, by 
dropping the point of the cone in the left hand corner of the board, 
and with an onward motion, in accordance with the flow of sugar 
(which will be little or much, in proportion to the pressure you give 
the tube); run it straight 'on to the right hand corner (see No. 4). 
Notice that you can make this line larger by pressing harder on the 
cdne. Next repeat this, giving the cone a zigzag motion (No. 5) ; 
then commence light, gradually increasing the pressure, so as to 
produce a line small at one end and large at the other (No. 6) ; 
then reverse it by beginning heavy and finishing light (No. 7). 
When you wish to disconnect the cone from the sugar, do so by 
taking off the pressure from the cone, and giving a quick, sudden, 
upward jerk. Now do some cross stringing (No. 8), then No. 9 to 
17; then with the same cone, held perpendicular (and the sugar 
pushed out until the drop is the required size, then suddenly de- 
tached in the same manner as above mentioned), drop different 
sized drops or dots (No. 18 to 20) ; then with the same cone, by 
commencing at the large end first and gradually drawing it to a fine 
thread do No. 21. Now take the star cut cone (No. 22), and 
drop some star dots, the same as in Nos. 18, 19, and 20; then with 
a circular or rotary motion, make roses (No. 23) ; then repeat with 
this star cone all that you have done with the plain round cone. ^ 
Next take the leaf cone (No. 24), and by beginning at the large 
end of the leaf first, and gradually drawing it to a point, make the 



'OoSo. 1$

a^

352 



ORNAMENTAL ICINO. 



leaf as long as desired (No. 25) ; by giving the cone a wavy motion 
you form the veins in the leaf. Then put two together (No. 26), 
and with the star cone add a rose (No. 27); then three leaves and 
a rose (No. 28); then four, as in No. 29; then five, with a sinnple 
plain dot in the center (No. 30;. Now, with the plain round cone, 
make No. 31, adding to it, for top finish, No. 21; next, with the 
same cone, make the stems of Nos. 32 and 33, and with the leaf 
cone add the leaves. Do the same in No. 34, adding a ring of dots, 
also a ros?, with the star cone; next, with the same plain round 
cone, do No. 35f by giving the cone a wavy motion; also No. 36, 
by giving the cone a sudden jerk, first to the left, then to the right, 
then straight down the middle, as shown in No. 37. 

This appears a good deal on paper, but is really nothing when 
you come to do it, as it can all be done on the board at one lesson, 
and two or three lessons should sufiBce to give you a good insight, 
and each one you do will be better than its predecessor, and you 
will surprise yourself at the ease with which you can produce and 
execute a design, if you only master these diagrams first. 

Having gone this far, you may now form a design for yourself 
by making whatever combination fancy dictates, from the scrolls, 
lines, curves, etc., shown in the diagrams; it may be somewhat 
crude at first, but practice will perfect. As an example, which 
will explain the whole, I will instruct you how to make a simple 
combination, and thereby produce a bunch of grapes. First, with 
the leaf cone make four leaves (No. 38), and with the plain round 
cone add the stem ; also, with the same kind of cone, only cut a little 
larger, to make a larger drop, add grapes by making a succession 
of dots, gradually making them higher in the middle (No. 39) ; then 
n< i\ finish, with the plain small cone, add the scroll as shown run- 
ning over the grapes. I will also give one other illustration. To 
m ike a large leaf, "in imiUition of those used on bride's cake, first 
mark the outline of the leaf (No. 40), then with the plain round 
cone run the cross lines, as shown in No. 8, also in No. 41 ; then 
\vith the plain round cone add the edge in dots, as shown in Nos. 20 
and 42. To illustrate this farther, I furnish a full sketch for the 
top of a wedding or other cake (page 353) made up of the grapes and 
leaves I have described. I must now leave you to the study and 



854 



ORNAMENTAL ICINQ, 



practice of the diagrams, assuring you that you will find it much 
more simple than it here appears, and that the results attained at eacb 
trial will be such as to stimulate you to further efforts and succesa. 
I will here remark that you can do heavy and light work with the 
same cone by adding pressure ; for instance, if you are using a cone 
with a fine point, by drawing that with a regular motion and even 
pressure, you produce a line of sugar the same size as the hole 
through which it comes; but if you draw the cone along slower than 
the sugar comes out, you will readily see that you produce a heavier 
line ; also, if you wish to make a very fine line with the same cone» 
use the even pressure, but draw the cone along very fast; you have 
only to bear in mind that there \a a limit to the size, and when you 
reach that to press harder simply means to burst the cone ; when the 
limit is reached, if you want a larger flow, you must have another 
cone with a larger opening at the point This applies to all shapes, 
whether round, star, or leaf. The cone may be used in the same 
manner you would a pen, pressing heavy and light ; for example, 
if you are making a scroll, like No. 11, with a fine round cone, 
when you come to the bend of the scroll, by giving the cone a little 
more pressure you cause more sugar to flow, thus producing the 
fullness in the curve (see No. 11) ; when you have done that with* 
draw the pressure and continue as before. 

lERINOUE ICINO 

Beat the whites of six eggs to a very stifi* firoth (you can not beat 
them too stifi*; emd if they are not stifl* the meringue will not be 
good.) While beating, add a saltspoonful of salt, also a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar ; when well beaten up add half a pound of sugar, and 
stir it very lightly in, yet be careful to see it is toM stirred in. 
This being ready, take the pie after baking (usually a lemon pie), 
and with a knife spread a thin coating of the meringue all over it; 
then with a cone (the same as used in other icing), filled with the 
meringue icing, proceed to work out some design. When finished re* 
turn it to the oven to take a light brown color. You can work anj 
design in this as well as in icing-sugar, but the patterns for this are 
larger, consequently are done with a cone with a larger portion cut 
oS the point. For centers of meringue pies you can use such designi 



/ 



356 



ORNAMENTAL ICINO. 



as an ear of corn, an anchor, a ** true lover's knot," a Maltese 
a bunch of grapes, or whatever the fancy dictates; you can further 
decorate it with fruit jelly in addition to the meringue piping, put- 
ting on the jelly with a cone, and in the same manner as for piping. 
Chocolate is not used on meringue work, neither is the meringue 
ever colored except in some cases when it is colored a light cream 
color ; pink colored sugar is sometimes sprinkled over it. To color 
this sugar, simply drop a little cochineal color on some granulated 
ftugar, and rub it together until colored, then dry it, then rub it 
apart and keep it in a bottle ready for use. It will keep its color for 
years. I give one design (page 355) for the top of a meringue 
pie just as a guide. 

TO MAKE WATER ICING. 

Take any quantity of powdered sugar you require, add cold 
water enough to it to form a thick paste (remember, it will not take 
much) ; beat well, and if too thin so that it runs too much, add a 
little more sugar. To every pound of sugar, add as much cream 
of tartar as will lie on a twenty-five cent piece (a level teaspoon- 
ful) ; when this icing is prepared, spread it with a knife over the 
cake, and allow it to dry ; you can then ornament or decorate it 
with icing sugar in the same manner as for a bride's cake, or use a 
sweet jelly, such as **red currant" or "quince." 

This water icing may also be colored a light shade of pink with 
" cochmeal," or a light cream color with saffron. For a mauve 
oolor, add a drop of indigo blue to the pink color ; but remember 
none of these colors must be heavy, as they are objectionable and m 
bad taste. Water icing is used for tops of pound, sponge, and 
other cakes, also for tops of jeUy cakes. (See design for jelly cake, 
page 353.) 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Ask any confectioner for a piece of ** Baker's eagle cocoa; " and 
if you can not procure that, ask any grocer for pure cocoa in block, 
or what is called ** Baker's premium cocoa." Place what you need of 
it in a basin, and stand the basin in boiling water until the cocoa 
b dissolved, then add powdered sugar to taste, and beat it 
well in; add also the whites of two eggs (whisked up a little) to 



ORNAMENTAL ICING. 357 

every pound of cocoa used (this gives a gloss); beat the sugar 
in well and the whites of eggs ; now with a knife spread the cocoa 
(or rather the chocolate now that it has the sugar in it, for choco- 
late issinaply cocoa sweetened) evenly on the cake; be as quick as 
possible with it, for as soon as it cools it gets hard* If you wish 
simple cocoa icing, use the cocoa and whites of egg only ; but if 
you wish sweet or chocolate icing, add the sugar. To help you a 
little in the first attempt, add one tablespoonful of hot water to a 
pound of cocoa ; this will keep it moist and liquid a little longer, 
but it will take a little longer to harden. 

CREAM CHOCOLATE ICING. 

What is known as cream chocolate icing is done in the same man- 
ner, using half cocoa and half pure cream, and sweetening it to 
taste. In this case use no whites of eggs, but simply dissolve the 
cocoa as before described, then add the sugar, and afterwards grad- 
ually add and well stir in the cream. It is then ready for use. 
Chocolate icing is also used to ice jelly cakes and other small cakes, 
also chocolate -de-clares ; it may also be used as an icing for any 
thing, and can be piped, ornamented, or decorated with icing sugar 
in the same manner as a bride's cake. 

Cocoa may also be mixed with sugar icing ; add little or much 
cocoa as desired, and either ice a cake with this chocolate icing or 
use it for piping or ornamenting in the same manner as icing sugar 
}s used. 

TO ICE OR FROST A WEDDING OR ANY FLAT TOP CAKE. 

When the cake is baked and cold, cut off all the rough parts and 
brush ofifall crumbs ; then prepare an icing *in the manner described, 
but in this case for first icing use ordinary *' powdered sugar;" give 
the cake a thin covering with this icing, simply to fill up the 
hollows, so that the second coat of icing, made from finer sugar, may 
rest smoother on it. If in a hurry, and you do not care so much 
about the appearance, then give one coat of icing only. In that 
case the sugar must be the kind I have mentioned (the finest). When 
a first coat is used, place it in the oven or in some warm place to 
dry, before adding the second coat. 

^* Please note where the word icing or ice is \Laed it means frosting. 



358 



ORNAMENTAL ICINQ. 



To add the second coat, prepare some icing in the manner de- 
scribed, and make it just soil enough to run smoothly, and yet not 
run off the cake ; better to be a little too stiff than too thin. To 
ice, place the sugar in a lump in the center of the cake, And let it 
run level of its own accord; or if a little stiff, spread it out with a 
knife, taking care not to spread it quite to the edge of the cake 
(within a quarter of an inch), as it will run to the edge of itself: if it 
is not fully smooth, place a knife under the cake and shake it a 
little, that will cause all the rough parts to become smooth. Next, 
if you desire to ice the sides of the cake, add a little more sugar to 
the icing, and beat it well in ; then with your knife place it on the 
sides of the cake until it is fully covered ; then by holding the kni& 
perpendicular, with the edge to the icing, and the back leaning a 
little towards the icing, draw it all round the side of the cake ; 
when it comes round to where you started from, suddenly give the 
knife a twist, and turn the back from the icing, and at the same 
time and by the same motion, remove the edge from contact with 
the icing. If you do this neatly and quickly you will hardly be able . 
to find the place where you left off. You may not succeed either in 
icing the cake or putting on a smooth side the first time, but prac- 
tice will perfect ; and if you note wherein you &iled at first, and 
avoid it the next time, you will soon succeed. The cake now needa 
only to be dried, and it is ready for ornamenting. 

To ornament or decorate it, prepare some icing in the manner 
described, but make it stiff enough to retain its shape, or at least aa 
that it will not run smooth like the icing on the cake. This is to 
be done by the addition of a little more sugar (a teaspoonful per- 
haps), also a little extra beating; when the icing is ready lightly 
mark out the design on the cake ; then fold up a piece of paper in 
t lie form of a cone, and secure the joint with white of egg or mucil- 
age, and cut off the point to form just what size hole you choose. 
Now fill the cone three-fourths full with icing, and fold down the 
end ; place cone in left hand to guide it, and with the thumb of the 
right hand placed on the folded part of the cone, force out the sugar 
in lines or dots to follow out the design on the cake. 

Those wishing further instructions in ornamenting «r^ '^^opectfully 
referred to article on Artistic Piping (with dii>gnrin/»). 



ORNAMENTAL ICING. 359 

TO PREPARE ICING FOR BRIDE OR OTHER CAKES. 

Procure a clean china bowl with a round (not square) bottom in- 
side ; break into it the whites of three eggs, add about half a 
pound of the finest powdered sugar obtainable (ask a confectioner 
for icing sugar, if that is not obtainable procure ** lozenge sugar; ") 
now with a wooden spatula, (which is made of a piece of wood about 
ten inches long and one and one-half inches wide at the thick end, 
and gradually tapering off to fit the hand, and not more than half an 
inch thick at the thick end. See diagram No. 40. I recommend 
wood because it is really better in every respect than any metal in- 
stniment for the purpose, and once made will last a life time) 
beat the sugar and whites vigorously until it begins to thicken, 
then add as much cream of tartar as will lay on a ten-cent piece, 
and one (not more than two) drop of indigo blue ; now add about a 
quarter of a pound more sugar, and continue beating; continue 
beating and adding sugar, a teaspoonful at a time, until the icing 
is as thick as you wish it, and it is ready for use. Be careful m>t to 
get any of the yolk of the eggs in, or you can not beat the icing up. 
Be careful that the bowl, spatula, and all the implements used 
are perfectly free from grease. Remember to beat well, and not 
attempt to get the icing thick by the addition of sugar alone, or 
it will run. Good icing depends up<m good beating as well as 
sugar ; three whites and one pound of sugar is about the propor- 
tion. 

EXPLANATION OP DESIGNS FOR BRIDE OR OTHER CAKES. 

A reference to the design for bride cake top No. 1 (page 369) 
will show that it is a combination of the scrolls, etc., given in the 
diagrams for artistic piping, and is not given as a design or a work 
of art, but is simply arranged (as I direct in my explanation of 
diagrams) to show how those scrolls, etc., can be connected and 
arranged so as to form a design. After you have made this one, 
you will be surprised how easy a task it will be to do a second. 
Please note that this design is made up of Nos. 36, 20, 13, 18, 6, 
8, and 21 of the diagrams ; also note that I have given two leaves 
of one pattern and two of another. When you pipe cake make all 
four leaves of the same pattern, choosing which you prefer. I have 



360 



ORNAMENTAL ICINO, 



given two simply to illustrate the diagrams, or I would have 
sketched them all alike. I also give a sketch for the side of the 
cake if you wish to pipe the side. This you will note is No. 17 
in the diagrams, and the bott<jm is finished off with simple, plain 
round dots (No. 2 in diagrams^, but all of one size. 

My sketch for bride's cake top No. 2 (page 361) is more correct as 
a design, and is to l)e done after you have practiced on No. 1 de- 
sign. I will not refer you to the diagrams for this design, but ask you 
to pick out what numliers of the diagrams are used in making up 
this dasign, as by so doing it will fix it in your memory. These de- 
signs will answer for the top of any cake as well as for bride's cake; 
if you use them for bride's cake, use nothing but w^hite icing, also 
white piping, and in the center where I have marked (**for vase ") 
insert a vase, or bouquet, or spray of flowers, as you see fit. The 
addition of a few sugar ro^^es and silver leaves (procurable at all 
confectioners) will add to the eftect. It is also necessary to place 
the cake on a lace paper, particularly if a bride's or wedding cake; 
and if on a silver or plated salver, so much the better. 

It is not imperative that you a«e orange blossouLs in the decora- 
tion of bride's cake, still it is usually done. It is also admissible to 
use (very sparingly) pink roses or other flowers, or even yellow 
to match with the orange blossoms or in place of them ; but rather 
than use too much or too many, use none. If you do not wish to 
pipe the side of a bride's cake, place a silver band round it. You 
can procure the band of any respectable confectioner or caterer. 



DESSERT CAKE. 

A dessert cake (proper) consists of either a pound or sponge cake 
mixture baked in a high mold ; if you have no other use, an ice 
cream mold as represented in the sketch. Well clean and fully 
dry your mold, then w^arm it and butter it with butter by the aid 
of a brush (by warming it the butter goes in all parts); when 
buttered turn it ])ottom up to drain out all excess of butter; when 
drained dust it out with sifted flour, give it a knock to remove any 
excess of flour; it is now ready; now place it, small end down, in a 
tin or something which will prevent its tailing over; now flll it three- 
fourths full with the cake mixture and bake in a steady heat; when 



^ 



362 



ORNAMENTAL ICING. 






baked remove it from the mold. When cold, if to be ornamented, 
have ready prepared some icing (see ** icing") thin enough to just run 
smooth but not to run off. Place the cake on a plate, and with a 
spoon place the icing on the top of the cake, and allow it to run 
down the sides ; continue this until all parts are covered ; let it drain 
down a minute or so, then place a knife under the bottom of the 
cake, remove *it to another plate, and set it in a warm place to 
dry. This method of icing shows up the pattern of the cake, and 
the prettier the mold the prettier pattern of cake you will have. 
To ornament this cake, simply pipe it (as before described), allow- 
ing the pattern of the cake to be the guide ; if you come to any 
part where there is no pattern, then ornament it as you fancy, but 
usually the pattern of the cake will furnish the design. In an ice- 
cream mold there is not much pattern further than fluting. I give a 
sketch of one baked in a pyramid ice-cream mold, (page 353,) to- 
gether with some idea as to how you are to ornament it. Where the 
dots appear, you can substitute red and yellow gum drops if you so 
desire. When you have piped this cake set it on a plate or sal- 
ver on lace paper, place a bouquet or spray of flowers on top (see 
sketch), add a few silver leaves where you see fit, and it is complete. 
This cake looks very pretty iced a light pink and piped in white; 
you can not well use chocolate ice for this cake (as the chocolate sets 
too soon), unless you are pretty well accustomed to chocolate icing. 

DESSERT RUSSE. 

This may be made of either sponge or pound-cake mixture, and 
baked in a ^cy mold, If the prescribed mold is not available, an 
ordinary two quart ice-cream mold would answer the purpose pretty 
well. After being baked and allowed to completely cool, the cake 
should be iced with thin icing, either pink or white, and piped in 
contrasting colors. Thus, if iced white, it should be piped pink, 
and mce vefna. Further ornamentation can be made by a proper dis- 
tribution of pastilles, crystallized fruits, etc., and the whole sur- 
mounted by a small spray or bouquet of flowers. 

Another way of making it is by use of stale cake. If you have 
stale sponge or pound-cake, first cut from it the base with a sharp 
knife (see figure 1, page 355) ; then the piece as per figure 2, then 
the piece as per figure 3. Place the three, one above the other, 
then ice and ornament it.

ORNAMENTAL ICING. 



Either of the foregoing cakes are left as they come from the 
mold, or in the shape they are cut with the knife. The pieces, 
numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, added, being only for the russe. 

For the russe, produce the cake by either of the alx)ve methods, 
remembering to have as large a hole in it as circumstances will 
allow, (see dotted line in Nos. 1, 2, and 3,) this, of course, is filled 
with cream ; then piece No. 3 is added and secured. Next take a 
thin piece of cake, not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness, 
and cut out the pieces as per Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and set them 
aside for future use. Next, take a pallet-knife, and cover the whole 
russe with red or some other colored jelly. This done, place on the 
pieces Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, in their respective places (the jellj 
will hold them). Leave the cut part outside, so that none of the 
baked parts will show, and the desired effect is produced. The 
pieces being in their places, you next pipe and otherwise ornament ; 
finish the whole by the addition of a spray or bouquet of flowers on 
the top, or with a bouquet of leaves, piped on with a leaf tube. 
Another way to make it, is to cut the base out of a solid piece of 
cake ; make the hole and fill it with cream ; lay on that a thin piece 
of cake. Then with a cone and tube pile up the cream in pyra- 
mid shape. Have ready six strips cut the proper shape, i, e., the 
same width at the bottom as one of the six sections of the base, 
and gradually tapering to the top. Place these pieces in their proper 
position, fasten them with a little icing, cover the whole with jelly, 
as in the other case, or leave plain, as you choose. In either case 
pipe and otherwise ornament it. If preferable, you can place the 
strips to form piece No. 3, securing them 'i^ith icing ; then force 
cream through the opening on the top. By this means you get that 
part better filled with cream than by any other means. 



THE CHANTILLY CUSTARD. 

The plates from 1 to 4, inclusive, show the manner of making 
the Gatian for the custard, which is thus described : First, procure 
a mold for sponge-cake or jelly, about one quart or three pints size, 
with a fancy fi^it or flower top (see plate No. 1). Bake in thb a 
cake or sponge mixture (or plain pound mixture, if you prefer it), 
and when bi^ed and cold — ^it is all the better if kept for a day or 



ORNAMENTAL ICING. 365 

two — cut off the top (see figures 2 and 3), and ice it with thin, 
white icing. When thoroughly dry, lightly color the different fruits 
or flowers with their natural colors. Do not lay on the colors too 
heavily, or they will spoil the eflect 

Next cut out the center of the cake (see figure 4), and fill the 
cavity thus made with a boiled custard, adding chopped almonds to 
the custard according to taste. When the custard is set and cold 
replace the top (as in figure 3), and pipe the outside of the cake in 
any way you may choose, following the design here given, or se- 
lecting from the design ibr dessert cake, or from page of diagrams. 

The light and dark balls at the bottom of the present design are 
intended to represent pink and yellow pastilles placed alternately 
(see figure 6). But a much easier, cheaper, handier, and more effect- 
ive mode of adding these balls, which is simply to stick on gum- 
■drops of Ihe alternate colors. If you can procure a good, clear 
white gumdrop, then use the three colors alternately — red, yellow, 
white — and the effect is capital. 

The beauty of such a piece of work, amply repays any lady 
who has the time and taste, for the trouble of mastering the ac- 
<x>mplishment, and for the small cost of material. The cost of the 
latter, when compared with the prices which would be charged by 
a professional caterer for a similar piece of work, is very small. 

RAISED PIE. 

We here present an original design, composed of five distinct 
plates, arranged and numbered for practical use. The illustration 
(page 367) represents a raised pie. It may be filled to suit the 
taste with either meats or game. 

Figure 1 shows the pie complete, with top of savory or aspic 
jelly, surmounted by a butter lamb on a chopped parsley bed, and 
piped in butter. Cornucopias on each corner are filled with roi>t 
flowers, making a horn of plenty. 

The directions are as follows : Prepare the dough as usual for 
raised pie, and then determine the size. Next cut the base — not 
less than one-half inch in thickness — as per figure 2. Dock with a 
Ibrk to prevent blistering, and lay aside on the pan ready for 



866 ORNAMENTAL IdNQ. 

baking. Then prepare the oval bottom, as per figure 3, wash 
over with egg, and place evenly on center of the base. Now roU 
out dough, half an inch thick, in a narrow strip, long enough to go 
all round the oval bottom (measure outside of oval by passing a 
string around it); cut it straight and even, one inch wide. Wet 
the ends, which should be cut slantiug to make them fit closely, and 
the lower edge, and wrap this around the oval piece which lies on 
the base, joining ends and bottom edge securely. The edge of the 
strip will rest on the base, with the oval piece inside. Now fill 
this case to within half an inch of the top with bran, place over it 
a thin cover of dough (with a small hole in the center) ; wash the 
outside (except the top, which only serves to keep the side in place, 
and is not used) with egg, and bake in a moderate oven until it 
takes on a fine chestnut brown. While cold, cut out top, turn out 
bran, and the shell is ready for filling. It is better to make the 
shell the day before using, so as to fill it at leisure. To make 
the cornucopias, fold up the dough the same as you would in 
making a paper cone, and also fill with bran. Bake them sepa 
lately from the pie. Now fill shell with meat or game, and next 
place the savory jelly (which should be ready cut in pieces 
one-half inch square) on the top, as per figure 6. Now mold 
a butter lamb and place on top of jeUy, as per figure 7. Add 
the chopped parsley, as per figure 8; also place the cornucopia 
in position. Place the cut roots (see figure 4) one in each cor- 
nucopia (see figure 9); place a rim of sliced lemon on the top 
edge, as shown in figure 1, and add the small cut root flowers 
at base of the cornucopias, securing them with butter. Pipe the 
pie any design you choose, or, as in the design, using butter instead 
of sugar. A little parsley under each cut root flower on the com* 
ucopias adds to the effect. Soften the butter by working it with a 
knife, not warming, adding a little yolk of egg to bring it to the 
required softness, and a little flour to toughen it. Figure 5 shows 
one of the cornucopias before it is placed on the shell. Serve cold, 
with a salad, on a large napkin, with a little parsley around it, 
The meat used for filling should always be cold. It is a summer 
dish, and looks well on the table. 

The special directions for making the crust for raised pie are as 



368 ORNAMENTAL ICING, 

follows : Take a quarter of a pound of lard for every pound of flour, 
Bdd half a pint of water, also a pinch of salt; to make it, add the 
]ard to the water, bring it to a boil, then add it to the flour and 
mix as quickly as possible; when mixed wrap it up in a cloth to 
keep warm. Make into the shape or shapes selected as quickly as 
possible, as when it gets cold it hardens; when cold it will i-etain 
any shape given it while warm. You can use pie-molds, in which 
case simply line the mold with tlie paste, when the pie is made it 
is well to allow it to stand all night if possible, to get fully flxed 
before baking. Before adding any leaves or other paste decora- 
tions wash it with yolk of eggs, then add the paste leaves, and do 
not wash them. The pie will then bake a rich brown, while 
the leaves remain a pale color, giving a pretty efiect. 

A very nice meat for filling is made as follows : Bone two calves' 
feet; chop fine boiled chitterlings; cut up and stew over a gentle 
fire for an hour two chickens, and two sweet breads, in a quart of 
veal gravy; season with cayenne pepper and salt; then add six or 
eight force-meat balls (that have been boiled); four boiled eggs 
quartered; and, when stewed enough, let stand until nearly cold, 
and place it in pie, cover with aspic jelly, and ornament as above 
directed. In case you do not wish to use the butter-lamb and 
aspic jelly, afber filling in meat, place four quarters of a hard- 
boiled egg at equal distances apart on the top of the meat, and 
strew a few cold green peas or asparagus tops on it. This gives a 
pretty effect, and saves the trouble of making the aspic jelly. The 
shell may be filled with any cooked cold meat. Rabbits make a 
nice filling, stewed with a nice cut or two of ham or salt pork. 
Make a force-meat out of the livers beaten in a mortar until fine, 
adding freelyof pepper and- salt, a little nutmeg, and a few sweet 
herbs. Partridges, or any game birds, may be used, bearing in 
mmd that the pie is always to be served cold. 

TO ORNAMENT A JELLY CAKE. 

Trim off the edge of the jelly cake, then give it a thin coating of 
water icing (see water icing) ; next have a cone of white icing ready. 
To the more fully illustrate this, I will request you to follow out 
the pattern in my design (Page 353). After you have made that 



PASTRY, 369 

one, you can do any other you choose, as that one explains the 
whole. Now with the cone of white (or pink sugar, if you prefer 
it), pipe on the white lines in the sketch (see sketch) ; now fill in 
between these lines with fruit jelly (use a cone filled with jelly for 
this purpose) ; next, with the leaf cone, pipe on the leaves for the 
grapes (as described in diagrams for Artistic Piping, No. 38) ; then 
with a plain round cone pipe on the grapes, as described in No. 39, 
in diagrams. (See diagrams. The edge is simple plain dots of 
white sugiir. See diagram No. 2.) I would here remark, if you 
so wish it you can pipe on the bunch of grajies with fruit jelly in- 
stead of sugar. You can also use chocolate ice instead of water 
ice for the top. Then pipe it in sugar and jelly as before, or ice it 
with jelly instead of either chocolate or water icing. In that case, 
where before you used jelly between the white lines of sugar, now 
use chocolate or pink icing. Or if you wish, you can dispense with 
the top icing of either jelly, chocolate, or water icing, and simply 
work out the design as shown in the white piping and jelly. But 
the foregoing is the most artistic; and I would here remark that 
what I give here is given simply for the instruction of those who 
w^ish to do artistic work ; to others the instructions will be valueless. 
But my experience teaches me that most ladias have a taste for the 
ornamental, and wish to show it in this particular, as well as in 
others. And what would apix?ar difficult to others will be easy to 
them ; and I promise them they will be rewarded for their pams 
when they see how successful they are. 

Pastry. 

Under the head of pastry is embraced crusts or covering? for meat 
pies. Pastry made from butter, and- in the same manner as for 
fruit pies, patties, etc., is too li<2:ht, brittle and gross for meat pics; 
also too expensive. Paste made for domestic use, of lard, is also 
open to many objections, among which may be mentioned its ten- 
dency to grow soft and flabby : also its cold, sodden nature, which 
renders it extremely unpleavsant to the teeth, also unpleasant to the 
palate ; it also has a tendency to lie heavily and cold on the stom- 
ach, and is altogether undesirable as an ingredient in the man« 

u&cture of pastry. Neither is it any cheaper than suet, and much 
24 



870 PASTRY. 

more difficult to manu&cture into good looking pastry, and impossi' 
ble to make into good eating pastry. For as pastry for meat pies, 
patties, mince pies, etc., nothiug better than suet can possibly be 
found. It is a little troublesome to those who have not been accus- 
tomed to its use, but if you follow my instructions faithfully you 
will succeed better than you expect, and will, I think, be reim* 
bui-sed for your trouble, and have a pastry which will give satisfac- 
tion and credit to you as the maker. 

TO USE SUET. 

Allow three quarters of a pound of beef suet for every pound of 
flour; in this case adding a little salt to the water you mix the 
flour with. First take the suet, divest it of all loose skin and 
blood spots, then with a sharp knife shred it in as fine slices as 
possible, then place it in some place where it will just feel the heat, 
nothiug more (it must not be any thing like melted). While this 
is softening mix the dough; when mixed roll out in a sheet, the 
same as for best pastry, then lay on the suet to cover the dough, 
then fold and roll the same as for best pastry. (See instructions 
for puff pastry.) This paste will require a few more foldings and 
rollings than as if made with butter. When it is rolled enough, 
proceed to cover the pie dish as you woiild with other pastry; 
also for patties, mince pies, etc., use and work it off precisely as 
you would for puff pastry. If you were (after shredding the suet) 
to beat it soft with the rolling-pin on the board, you could roll out 
the paste with more ease, and it would not take more than five 
minutes. 

A very fine butter, called " French butter," for making an extra 
short yet flaky pastry, is made as follows : Take three quarters of a 
pound of beet suet, a quarter of a pound of good butter, and the 
yolk of two eggs, and a half teaspoon of salt; remove the skin and 
blood spots ftt^m the suet, place it in a mortar, pound it soft, then 
add the butter and salt, pound that well in, then add the eggs, work 
the whole into a smooth mass, then use it in the same quantity luid 
in the same manner as for puff pastry. 

This suet crust rolled half an inch thick, and then into cakes with 
a cutter, say two inches in diameter, then washed with eggs and a 



PASTRY. 371 

few cuts given across the top with a sharp knife, and baked a nice 
rich brown in a middling hot even, makes a delicious article for the 
tea-table. It is not as gross as pufT paste. 

I give here the best method of making a few of the hundred and 
one articles to be produced with puff and short pastry, etc. The 
Allowing is the most simple and best method of making short paste. 

SHORT PASTE. 

Take one pound sifted flour, place it in a bowl, add to it half a 
pound good butter. Break the butter up very fine in the flour, 
adding a little salt (according to the saltness of the butter) ; now 
add half a pint of cold water with half a teaspoonful of cream' of 
tartar dissolved in it (this is to toughen it), then mix it into an 
easy dough, adding more water, if required. When mixed, work 
well together, and place it near by ready for use. Keep it covered 
with a damp cloth, or between two plates, and in a cool place. 
Short paste is very useful from the fact that it b easy to make, 
and can be kept in better shape, where the shape of the article you 
wish to make is an object It is also better adapted for lining the 
bottom of paste pans, dishes, etc., as it is firmer than puff paste. 
Consequently it holds together, and when you wish to make a great 
deal of pastry, it is well to make a little short paste for that pur- 
pose, using the short paste for all lining or bottom work, and the 
puff paste for all top work. In using puff paste, when you have 
not made any short paste, cut out all of the tops first, then take 
the scraps and roll them, using them for lining and bottoms. 

Now suppose we wish to make a few open tarts. 

OPEN TARTS. 

Take the puff paste, after it has received its last rolling, roll out 
evenly in a sheet one-fourth of an inch in thickness (you need not 
roll out the whole of the paste, but cut off a piece sufficient to make 
the number of tarts you wish, and roll them out). The sheet being 
ready, cut the number you require with a scalloped round cutter, 
about two and a half inches in diameter. Place them on the 
baking pans, having turned them over, bringing the bottom on the 
top. N^t wash them with ^g, or egg and water, then with a 



372 ' PASTRY. 

flmall, plain rouiid cutter, one inch in diameter, make a mark in 
the center of each, pressing the cutter half through. Then just 
** dock " each in the center with the point of a knife or a fork (this 
is to prevent their blistering), now bake them. You will then find 
that the part marked with the small, round cutter has detached 
itself from the other part ; this you remove with a penknife or a 
fork, and a hole will be left, into which pour what jam or jelly 
you intend using. This plan is far preferable for making the hole 
to receive the jelly than to place, as some recommend, sliced potatoes 
or small yieces of wood in the center, removing them when baked. 
These certainly form the hole, but their weight keeps down the 
pastry, and consequently it is not so light. By the plan I have 
given you obtain a good hole for the jelly without injuring the 
lightness of the pastry. Some add their jelly before baking, but 
that is wrong, as in baking the heat causes the jelly to boil, and 
it spreads itself over the tart and spoils its appearance. 

OYSTER PATE (A LA PYRAMID). 

Take a piece of short paste, or scraps of puff paste, roll it out 
one-fourth of an inch thick, and cut out the number of pieces you 
require with the same cutter as for open tarts, place them in baking 
pan and "dock" them with a fork. Now cut a like number with 
the same cutter, and of the same thickness, but from the best puff 
paste, wash those cut from the scraps, or short paste, and place 
those cut from the puff paste on them, wash with egg, and " dock " 
them in the middle. Next cut a like number, same thickness, with 
the same cutter, and from puff paste, cut the middle right out of 
these with a plain round cutter, one inch and a half in diameter, 
place these rings on the other parts. These are now ready to 
bake. While they are baking take the piece that comes from the 
middle of the ring piece and roll it out a little larger, then cut 
three other pieces with a scalloped round cutter, each a size smaller 
than the others ; place them on baking pans, ** dock" them, wash 
with eggy and bake them. When these parts are all baked, if 
the hole is not deep enough for the purpose, you can, with a 
knife, remove some of the pastry inside the ring. To serve these 
you fill the case, or part with the hole, with chopped oysters, pre- 



PASTRY. 373 

pared in white butter sauce, and then add the other pieces, beginning 
with the largest and finishing with the smallest. You will then 
have a pyniinid about six inches high. Place small sprigs of 
parsley between the part containing the oysters and the others, 
also a piece of parsley on each, then dish them and serve. These 
cases will serve for oysters, lobsters, or chicken. I would here re- 
mark that oyster and other pate^ can be made more simply than th(» 

above, but my idea is not to attempt to teach what I presume \ - 
already known, but to furnish you with some ideas which you may 

use with advantage w^hen you wish to place something more elal)- 

rate before your special guests than ordinarily. A vol au vent is 

made in precisely the same manner as the above oyster pedes, but 

from eight to twelve times larger, and generally oval in shape. It 

is usually filled with cold fricassee of fowl or chicken. The fripassee 

for a vol au vent must be good and well-jellied. Before serving a 

vol au vent, place it on an oval dish and garnish it tastefully with 

aspic jelly, parsley, and cut root flowers. An ordinary size for a 

veil au vent would be a case large enough to hold a fricassee of one 

large fowl or two chickens. 

KASFBERKY PUFF. 

Proceed precisely the same as for open tarts. When you have 
cut the desired number, roll them out thin, about six inches in 
diameter, Now place a teaspoonful of raspberry preserves on it, a 
little from the center, spread it a little, and then bring the back 
part over on the preserve, keeping it back a little from the front 
edge, for if it laps over the bottom edge is prevented from rising. 
It is best to allow the top edge to lie back from the the front edge 
at least one-fourth of an inch. This folding forms a half circle." 
This .being done, wash them with water, or egg and water, and 
dust them with powdered sugar. Also cut a few deep but shorj 
cuts across the top — over where the preserve lays — when baked, 
the preserve shows through. 

COVENTRY PUFF. 

For these take scraps of puff paste and roll out into a sheet 
one-fourth of an inch in thickness. Cut the number of pieces you 
require with a plain round cutter three inches in diameter. Roll 



374 PASTRY. 

these out same as for raspberry puffi; add some iancy preserves, 
theu fold or lap the paste over in three folds, so that wheu it is 
folded it will form a triangle. Then turn the folded part down on 
the baking pans, wash these with water, or e^g and water; dust 
with powdered sugar, and bake. You do not cut these on the top. 

DEEP FRUIT PIEa 

Fruit pies in deep dishes, such as made by the English and 
French, are preferable to ordinary fruit pie, because you obtain 

more juice and fruit. The best method of making these is as fol- 
lows: Take a deep, oval pie dish (china, not tin), line the edge with 
paste, also about half its depth inside. Now invert a small cup in 
center (an egg cup is best), and one that will stand a little above the 
edge of the dish ; next fill the dish with fruit, then add a little water 
if the fruit has not much juice. Some fruits, such as currants 
and raspberries, have enough juice. Also add sugar to taste ; now 
cover this with a crust of short paste, wash it with water, or white 
of an egg, and dust with powdered sugar. Make a few fancy cuts 
on it before baking, and after it is washed and sugared do not cut 
too deep. These cuts give a rich looking appearance. The cup in 
the center collects the juice, and if the whole of the pie is not eaten 
at one meal, what is left can be supplied with juice by simply lift- 
ing up the cup and allowing the juice to escape. The edge of this 
pie, to be artistic, should be pinched with the finger and thumb, 
then notched with a knife. If you use fruit which gives too much 
juice, you can prevent the boiling over by mixing a little flour with 
the sugar, about one teaspoonful of flour to twelve of sugar. 

ECCLES CAKES OR TARTS. 

Take one cupful of clean, well-picked currants, add to them one 
cupful of granulated sugar and one finely chopped lemon peel ; add 
to this a nice flavoring of ground ginger and cinnamon and mix the 
whole well together. Now take what short crust paste or cuttings 
of puff paste you require and roll it out in a short one-fourth of an 
inch thick, then cut it up in square pieces two inches square and 
put a teaspoonfnl of the above preparation of currants, etc. , in the 
center of each piece of pastry ; then pull over the edges allowing 



PASTRY. 375 

them to lap a little in the center ; then flatten them with the hand 
and turn them over (folded part down). Next, with rolling pin, 
roll them out until the currants, peel, etc., breaks through. Then 
place them on the baking pans, give them a few cuts across the top 
with a knife, wash them with milk or milk and egg, dust them with 
sugar and bake them a nice brown in a hot oven. This is a nice 
eating pastry. 

REAL ENGLISH BANBURY CAKE. 

Take an equal quantity of clean, well-picked currants, granu- 
lated sugar and finely chopped lemon peel and mix it all together 
and .then add a nice flavoring of ginger' and cinnamon; now add 
good fresh butter, enough to form the whole into a nice paste. Take 
the best puff* paste, roll it out in a sheet one-fourth of an inch 
thick ; cut this in pieces two inches square and place a piece of the 
prepared butter, currants, etc., in the center of each ; now take the 
two corners, the one nearest to you and the one opposite you, bring 
them up, press them together, and then with the palm of the hand 
press them down flat. This makes the pieces oval in shape and 
leaves two ends which are folded together at liberty to rise ; now 
wash the part that is not folded with water and add as much pow- 
dered sugar as you can get to remain on. Bake these in a slow 
heat. These are a little expensive, but are very fine and are the 
real English Banbury. 

FANCY OR BOOK SAUSAGE ROLL. 

Take a piece of best puff paste, roll it out to an eighth of an inch 
in thickness ; then cut it up in squares four inches square, lay them 

out on board ; then have the sausage meat ready, break it off* in 

pieces the size of a small egg ; roll them out three inches long and 

place one piece in the middle of each square of pastry, Now wet 

the edge of the pastry with water, then bring the part furthest from 

you over on to the part nearest to you, taking care to let it be back 

from the front at least one-fourth of an inch ; now wash these with 

egg, taking care not to allow the egg to run down over the sides 

of the pastry. Next give a few shallow cuts with a sharp knife ; 

then cut a leaf of pastry, place it in the center (do not wash it), 

and bake them a nice brown. If these are made well the edges 

will rise up and the roll will look like a book. 



876 PASTRY, 

RASPBERRY SANDWICHES. 

Take a piece of puff paste, after it is fully rolled and folded, then 
roll it out, one-fourth inch in thickness and fold ifover evenly (like 
a sheet of paper). Now roll this out to an eighth of an inch in 
thickness and about twelve inches in width ; now roll this up in a 
roll the same as you would a sheet of paper ; this sheet of paste 
should be so arranged in size as to form a roll (when rolled up) of 
two inches or two and a half inches in diameter ; when this is rolled 
up wet the edge so that it may not unfold again ; next press it flat 
until you reduce it to about three-fonrths of an inch in thickness; 
now take a sharp knife and cut it off in slices one-fourth of inch in 
thickness, lay these on the pan, cut part down, give them room and 
they will then flow considerably. Now bake them. When baked 
dust them well with powdered sugar and return them to the oven, 
which must, in the mean time, be made very hot so as to melt the 
sugar, this giving them a fine glaze. If you have a salamander to 
hold over them it will glaze tliem quicker than the oven, but if you 
have no siilamander, and can not get the oven hot enough, then 
wash them with the white of an egg, dust them with sugar and re- 
turn tliem to the oven for a few minutes. When all this is done 
spread ra<pl)erry jam or jelly on them and stick two together. You 
can dish them up artistically as fancy directs. They make a pretty 
dish and are all that can he desired in point of eating, and are a 
fiivorite on all French tables. 

GUTTKR TARTS. 

Take small patty pans, line them out with short crust and then 
fill them with red currants, black currants, raspberries or what fruit 
you choose ; heap them up high in the center, add a little powdered 
sugar to each, wet the edge of the paste with water, then lay on a 
top covering about an eighth of inch thick, press the two edges of 
pastry together and then with a sharp knife pare off the excess of 
pastry from the edges of the patty pans, holding the knife in a slant- 
ing position toward the center (^f the tart or patty ; now with the 
thumb press the paste around the base of the fruit, about half an 
inch from the edge of the i)atty pan ; press it hard enough to all 
but break the paste and so as to push the fruit up in a cone in the

center ; now wash them with water and bake them. The object 
of pressing the paste so thin around the base of the fruit, is that 
the juice of the fruit may break through the paste in baking and 
run around the groove or gutter formed by the pressing of the 
paste, and when baked it has a rich and pretty effect. They take 
their name from the peculiar appearance given to them by the fruit 
juice so running in this groove, and are consequently called gutter 
tarts. They look very pretty and give a fine effect. 

CREAPRECIES. 

L#ine out shallow patty pans with scraps of best paste rolled in a 
sheet, place a piece of bread in each and bake them in a cool oven ; 
when baked remove the bread and place in a teaspoonful of red 
currant or some other jellies or jam ; next cover this with some 
cheese cake preparation or with a custard that will set. Next 
have ready a little meringue, made in the usual manner from the 
whites of eggs and sugar, place a tablespoonful on each, bringing it 
up cone form ; sprinkle a little pink sugar on this and return them 
to the oven, just to color them a light brown? 

FONCHONETTS. 

Proceed as for " creaprecies." WJien baked place an almond 
macaroon (procurable at any bakers or grocers if you' have none in 
store) in each, cover the macaroon with half quince and half red 
currant jelly. Next have paper cone, same as used for ornament- 
ing a cake with frosting, fill this cone with meringue, same as used 
for the ** creaprecies;" next drop a spoonful of meringue in the 
center on the jelly, then with the meringue in the paper cone drop 
a small cone shaped pile on the center, on what is already on 
the jelly; then drop five or six around it. This will give you 
a circle of cones with one in the center ; the cones must not be too 
small, as they will not look well ; they should be as large as a 
twenty-five cent piece and at least one inch in height ; now return 
them to the oven just to color them. When cold drop just a little 
red currant jelly on the point of each cone. This makes one of 
the prettiest of fancy pastry dishes, and sets off a table wonder- 
fully well. 

I will give my method of making a beefijteak pie. 



878 PASTRY. 

BEEF STEAK PIE. 

First prepare seasoniDg of three parts salt and one part black 
pepper, with just a dash of grouud nutm^; uext tJike teuder steak, 
enough to fill the disli, cut this up iato thin slices, uow take each 
slice, spriukle it with just enough of the above seasoning to season 
it (not too high), then sprinkle It with chopped parsley; next roll 
it up and pass a small wuodeu skewer through it, to hold it, or you 
can dispeuse with the skewer if you place the fold downward, to 
prevent its unfolding; continue this until the dish is full, then add 
water sufficient to make a good gravy, now lay on the top of this a 
few hard boiled e^s sliced, then put on the crust, previoui-Iy having 
lined the inside edge of the dish with paste ; now wash the top witb 
eggs and bake it in a moderate heat; as soon as it boils, and haa 
boiled about ten minutes, the whole should be cooked. By adopting 
this plan the meat will be tender and the gravy much richer than 
by the plan of par-boiling the meat prior to baking ; the point to ob- 
serve being not to bake it too quick. For a simple beefsteak pie, 
cut the Bleak into strips about half an inch m thickness, season 
them, lay them in the dish, add water for gravy, cover with crust 
and bake.

POPULAR DIXIE DISHES. 



We give in the following pages a number of carefully selected and 
thoroughly tested recipes, furnished us by accomplished mistresses of 
8oathem mansions, in nearly every State in Dixie, always famous for its 
sumptuous tables and generous hospitality. 

These, in addition to the very excellent recipes, distinctively Southern, 
scattered through previous pages, will meet, we hope, every want, in the 
way of cookery rules which is likely to be felt by the Southern Matron. 

BREAKFAST AND TEA CAKES. 

Bakiko Powder Biscuit. — ^Two pounds or quarts of flour, four ounces 
of melted lard or butter, four teaspoonfuls of powder, one tea.spoonful of 
salt, one and one-half pints of tepid water or milk ; mix the powder in the 
floor dry, place the melted lard in a hollow in the middle, the salt and 
water or milk with that, and stir around, drawing the flour in gradually so 
as to make a smooth, soft dough, turn out on the floured table, press the 
dough out flat with the hands, fold it over again and again and press out 
till it is compact, even and smooth, let stand five minutes, roll ofit and cut 
Into biscuits, bake immediately. Biscuit dough sljould be made up soft, 
the shortening should be melted and added to tlie fluid milk-warm, to 
insure thorough incorporation. The common way of kneading the dough 
up into dumpling shape, perpetually breaking the layers and making the 
parted edges take up too much flour, is the way that ruins biscuit — Mrs. S. 
A. Kitchen. 

Beatek Biscnr. — One quart of flour, lard the size of a hen's e^f^, and 
one teaspoonful of salt; mixed with enough sweet milk to make a moder- 
avoly stiff batter. Beat for half an hour ; mould witli the hand or cut with 
biscuit cutter ; prick with a fork, and bake in a quick oven, not hot enough 
to blister. — Mr». 8. T.y in U^usekeeping in Old Virginia. 

Virginia Beaten Biscuit. — There has to be a maul, or Indian club 
over two feet long, and a stout table, for the beating; the biscuit will not be 
light unless you have the maul made of hard maple, squaro-Hhaped at the 
heavy end, but waving, so as to make uneven hollows in the dough and a 
hole in the handle for a string to hang it up by. Three pounds of flour, 
one large teaspoonful sidt, four ounces of butter or lard, three cups milk or 
water. Have the milk tepid, mix the melted butter and salt with it, and 
wet up the flour — ^nearly all — into soft dough, knead it to smoothnesH on 
the table, and then beat It out to a sheet with the maul, fold it over on itself * 
and beat out again. There is no established limit to the times tlie dough 
may be beaten out, but after a few times it l)egins to break instead of 
spread. This injures it, and an interval should be allowed for the dough

to lose its toughness ; the air in the hollows beaten into the dough makes It 
very light, and white and flaky. Modem innovators on the preceding 
practice add a teaspoonf ul of soda sifted into the flour and mix up witli 
buttermilk, beating besides in the regular mminer. There are few thing* 
more generally acceptable in some localities than beaten biscuit rolled out 
very thin and fried. — J/r«. E, T. />., liidnnond^ Va. 

Thin Bis<tit or Ckackeks.- One (juart of flour, one tablespoon of 
lard and butter mixed, and one teas]>o<)n of snlt made into a stiff paste 
with cold water \ beat dough until it blisters roll thin, prick with a fork 
and bake (juickly. 

BnTKH CiiACKKRs.— One quart of flour, one teaspoon of soda, one of 
salt, one tables])<>on of butter mixed into a stiff paste witli sweet milk; 
beat half an Iiour, roll tliin, i)rick and bake in a quick oven. 

CuEAM Crisps.— Put two and a half cups good rich cream, either sweet 
or sour, in a crock and add gradually four cups unsifted best Graham flour 
and half a cup sugar ; then take out on board and knead well, with one 
more cup Graham ; the dough wants to be very stiff and kneaded thorough- 
ly Roll out as tliin as for thin cookies, cut with biscuit^jutter, prick well 
and place in pans sliglitly buttered tlie first time, not greasing afterwards, 
in a rather hot oven, and bake immediately, putting them in bottom of 
oven first, and then in the upi)er oven to brown. If wanted "extra nice," 
sift the flour (using al)out one-eighth more flour). The quantity of sugar 
can l)e increased or diminislied, but for health's sake this is sufficient, or 
even less. Carefully made, they will be crisp and delicious. 

CuuKANT Buns.- Ilot for supper, no eggs required, favorite sort and 
quickly made. This makes forty-five ; four pounds of light bread dough, 
eight ounces each currants, softened butter and sugar. It is soon enough 
to begin these two hours before supper. Take the dough from the rolls at, 
say four o'clock, spread it out, strew the currants over and knead them in, 
roll out the dough to one-fiuarter inch sheet, spread the butter evenly over 
it and the sugar on top of that., cut in bauds about as wide as your hand, 
roll them out like roly-i)oly puddings, bru.sh these rolls all over slightly 
with a little melted lard so that the buns will not stick together in the pans, 
then cut off in pieces about an inch thick, place flat in a buttered pan, 
touching but not crowded, rise nearly an hour, bake fifteen minutes, brush 
over with sugar and water, dredge sugar and cinnamon over. 

Hot Cross Buns.- Place two and a half quarts of flour to warm 
thoroughly, (do not scorcli). When well wiuined, mix with it one tea 
cup of sugar, a scant teacup of butter melted in a pint of milk, half a tea- 
spoon etw'h of powdered cinnamon and coriantler seed ; mix all well togeth- 
er, and add ♦wo tablespoons of yeast ; set to rise, and when light, form the 
dough into buns, handling as little as possible; on each bun cut a cross 
with back of knife. Serve while hot. Made for "Good Friday." 

Kick Muffins. - -Stir into one pint of cooked rice while hot, one table- 
spoon of butter ; let cool and add three well beaten eggs, two pints of milk, 
one and a half pints of flour, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons 
of veast ; beat all well together and set to rise. Bake in muflin rings. 

!N UNS Puffs. — Melt one scant teacup of butter in one pint of hot milk ; 
* stir in this one quart of flour until mixture does not stick to sides of dish; 
let cool, separate four eggs, add yolks well beaten and strained first, lastly 
whites beaten until very light; fill buttered tins or cups half full and bake 
in a quick oven; remove and sprinkle with powdered sugar while hot; 
Nice for breakfast or tea. 



POPULAR DIXIE DISHES. a 

, French Rolls. — Pare and slice one or two potatoes, add half a pint of 
cold water, boil until tender, then rub through a colander with the water ; 
add tablespoon and a half of lard, one teaspoon each sugar and salt, and 
half teacup liquid yeast and tablespoon of liour ; let rise and when liglit 
beat in an egg and add a quarter of a pint warm milk and one quart of 
flour, first having dried it; let rise and when liglit make into oblong rolls, 
and place into buttered plates, let rise again, pric k and bake. An easy way 
to make the rolls of unifonn size if you have no cutter, is to roll out the 
dough half an inch thick, and cut with a round cutter; press the opposite 
sides together and mould into rolls. 

Twist Rolls. — From the douffh of loaf bread or French rolls, reserve 
enough to make two long strips alx)ut fifteen inches in length, and one in 
diameter; rub the hands well with lard or butter before shaping these 
strips; (they can be rolled and cut^ if preferred to moulding with hands, 
into proper shape;) pinch the two ends together so they will stick; twist 
them., pressing tlie other ends together to prevent untwisting; bake, or 
thev can be fried like doughnuts. — Mrs, S, C- Fleming, Ky. 

llrNGS. — Boil one pint of milk and let cool to blood heat, then pour ir 
over two tablespoons butter and half teaspoon salt ; wiien nearly cool add 
one well-beaten ^^'^ and one pint flour and half a yeast cake soaked in a 
tablespoon of tepid water, or a half teacup liquid yeast, leave in a w arm 
place to rise. AVhen light knead in three-quarters of a quart of flour- and 
add a tablespoon of sugar ; let rise and with the hands make into rings ; 
roll on the board a piece of dough to the len.sjrth of eight inches and as 
large around as the little finger, and pinch the ends together, put in but- 
tered pans and when light, prick and bake. 

Rick Crcqt eties. — One cup cold boiled rice, a teaspoon each sugar 
and melted butter, half teaspoon salt, one egg beaten liglit, eight crackers 
rolled fine, and a little sweet milk; mix all well together, mtike into oval 
cakes and fry in butter till a nice yellow brown, serve hot. A royal break- 
fast dish. — Mm. Col, Licjfjeit. 

Butter Rusks. — One pound of good, lively, roll dough, six ounces of 
butter, two ounces of sugar, half cup of milk or cream, ten yolks of eggs^ 
little salt, one and one-quaiter pounds of flour. They require five hours 
time to make, ruise and bake. Wann the butter, supir and cream, with 
the dough, together in a pan, and then mix thoroughly, beat in tlie yolks, 
two at a time, and most of the flour, gradually Lrirging the mixture to a 
smooth 3'ellow dough, then knead it thoroughly and after that set it away 
to rise. In about three hours knead the dough the second time, and an 
hour after knead once more, then make out as directed and notch the edges 
with a knife. They rise and bake in the same time as rolls, brush over 
with butter when done. Butter rusks are eminently French, ar.d e^ery 
French cook makes rusks by a different receipt — usually with more butteV 
than tlie foregoing — as migiit be expected, this unsweetened kind of cake 
figures considerably in French cof^kery. One says it is a^pongy kind of 
cake resembling Bath buns. Another says it should be rich, yellow and 
like a sponge, whence it takes its name. One mixes raisins, currants and 
shred citron in it for lunch and tea bread, ai:d makes it in various fancy 
shapes and tw- ists, also in large cakes. Another bakes tlie dough in form 
of round rolls, cuts off the top, takes out tlje crumb and fills with chicken 
or other meat, or, bakes In little moulds like oval gem pans, removes the 
inside and places in the shell or tliimble thus made a cooked bird with its

slices of brioche in orange syrup and fries them inclosed in batter as fritt- 
ers; and i^t a costly and" elegant dinner given in New York, on a Christ- 
mas, ''brioche crusts, with fruit" appeared among the pastries. But the 
following sweet varieties might be employed for that. Butter rusks of this 
pattern siiould open and curl backwards in baking, therefore should not be 
brushed over with butter when panned as rolls are. Persons in practice 
find it quickest to pull off pieces of dough of right size and mould them 
Instantly. Others cut off strips of dough, roll them in lengths and cut 
these up in roll sizes. Mould them up round with no flour or the board 
and only a dust on the hands, then place them in regular rows on tlie table 
— the smoothest side down. Take a little rolling pin — it looks like a piece 
of new broom handle — and roll a depression across the middle of each. 
Brush tliese over with the l^jast possible melted lard or butter, using a tin- 
bound vainish brush for the purpose. Double the rolls, the two buttered 
sides together as a turnover is made, and place them in the pans diago- 
nally, with plenty of room so they will not touch. Brush over the tops of 
the rolls in the puns with the least possible melted lard again and set them 
to rise about an hour — less or inore according to temperature. Bake in a 
hot oven, about ten minutes, brush over with clear water when done. Keep 
baking at short intervals and keep hot without diying out. 

French Sweet Rusks. — The receipt for making these is inquired for 
at places where tliey are made in perfection, perhaps oftener than any 
other. Tliey are cakes ratlier tlian bread ; very showy, and never fail to 
attract notice, should only be attempted with the strongest yeast or lightest 
dough, as they are otherwise slow to rise. The art to be acquired through 
practice is to make them elastic and pleasant eating, not clammy like half- 
baked bread. One pound of light dough, six ounces of butter, four ounces 
of sugar, six yolks and one whole egg^ half cup of milk, flavoring as indi 
cated below, one and one-quarter poimds of flour. If for afternoon tea,- 
take the dough from the breakfast rolls, and six hours before the rusks are 
wanted, place it in a pan with the butter, sugar and cream, let all get warm- 
ed through and the butter softened, then mix them thoroughly, l^ext add 
the egg and flour by littles, alternately, beating the mixture up against 
the sides of the pan, to make it smooth and elastic, spread the last handful 
of flour on the table, knead the dough as for rolls, pressing and spreading 
it out with the knuckles, and folding it over repeatedly, set it in a warm 
place for two or tliree hours, then knead it the second time. Every time 
the dough is doubled on itself the two edges should be pressed together 
first. "When tlie dough of this and of the brioche receipt is ^ood and fini- 
shed it looks silky, and air will snap from the edge when it is pinched. 
After this second kneading the dough should stand an hour and then be 
kneaded once more and made into shapes. The smaller notched shapes in 
rolls is perhaps the best for these; do not brush over the tops with 
butt«r lest they run out of shape, rise in the pans one and one- 
half hours, bake m a slow oven fifteen minutes, brush over when done with 
sugar, egg and water, mixed and flavored with vanilla, and dredge granu- 
lated sugar over. A little flavoring may be added in the dough ; either 
vanilla extract, vanilla and rose mixed, orange or nutmeg; but for a nice 
variation grate in the rind of one or two lemons and squeeze in some of the 
juice. If to be made over night without light dough for a start, all the in- 
gredients can be mixed at once by taking a pint of yeast and half-pint of 
milk — or nearly all yeast — adding all the other articles and flour to make 
soft dough. A good every day recipe for rusks is two pounds of light

CAKES. 

Geoboia Cocoanut Cake. — Grate a ]K)und of cocoanut and dry, cream,, 
one pound butter, add one of sugar, beaten yolks of two eggs, then the 
beaten whites and one pound of nour alternately, and last the grated nut, 
beat until perfectly light ; bake in a moderate heat for three hours. — L. A,

Drop Cakes. — One cup each sour cream and sugar, one teaspoon soda, 
one-half cup currants, one and a half cups flour ; flavor with nutmeg and 
cinnamon, and drop from spoon into a buttered pan, and bake in quick oven. 
These are delicious if eaten warm, and good cold. 

Kaffee Kuciien. — ^Take one-half cake compressed yeast, or teacup 
home-made, put it in a cup of warm milk, and stir this in the middle of a 
pan of flour ; when light, add one-half pound each butter and sugar, some 
floured raisins, teaspoon lemon essence, nutmeg and cinnamon; put in 
dripping pan, let rise, then with a cake brush rub the top with a beaten eggj. 
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake. — ^To bake fruit cake in paste; 
make it of flour and water, roll out on a board like pie crust, line your 
greased tins all over the inside with it and pour in the cake batter ; do not 
break off the paste till you want to use the cake. This is especially nice 
for sponge and fruit cakes. 

Akother Kaffee Kuchen. — Four pounds of light bread dough, eight 
ounces each sugar and butter or lard, one egg^ (not essential), take the 
dough at noon and mix in the ingredients all slightly warm, knead on the 
table with flour sufficient, set to rise until four o'clock, knead it again by 
spreading it out on the table with the knuckles, folding over and repeating, 
roll it out to sheets scarcely thicker tlian a pencil, place on baking pans» 
brush over with either water or melted lard, or milk, rise about an hour, 
score the cakes with a knife point as you put them in the oven to prevent 
the crust puffing up, bake about fifteen minutes. One of the attractions of 
this plain cake is the powdered cinnamon and sugar sifted on top after 
baking, the cake being first bruslied M'itli sugar and water. Cut in squarea

powder; bake in layers, ('over each layer with a thick icing, then cover 
with grated pine a])ple. Place on next layer and treat as before; or two 
cups sugar, one of milk, tw o-thirds cup butter, three eggs, and tiivo table- 
sp(Kms baking powder. Bake in three layers and make a frosting by boil- 
ing together one tea cup sugar and four tablespoons water, tfil brittle 
when tested in cold water, i)our this at once in a small stream over the

poond of lour, mixing very gently with a knife, add juice of half a lemon, 
poar in pans and bake from twenty to thirty minutes. The syrup is some- 
times left on the range, and when boiling is poured into the eggs which 
are then beaten until cold. The eggs thicken more quickly in this way, 
and the cake is excellent, but perhaps not quite so moist as that made with 
cool s>Tup. This cake has the advantage of keeping much longer than 
oatiinary sponsre cake.

a lemon, one quarter teaspoon soda. Put soda in flour and sift several 
times to mix well, beat butter to a light cream and stir in flour gradually 
"With the tips of fingers until it forms a smooth paste, add well whipped 
whites of eggs to the sugar ; stir these gradually into the flour and butter 
and add lemon juice, beat all smooth with an egg whip. Tliis cake may 
be made ^"ith a teaspoon baking powder or quarter teaspoon of so<la and a 
half teaspoon cream tartar when essence of lemon should be used instead 
of lemon juice. A splendid cake. — Mrs. E. /?., 8t, LouiSy Mo. 

Meringuks with Whipped Cream. — Four whites of eggs, one small 
cupful fine granulated sugar. Vanilla and lemon flavoring ; put the whites 
into a deep bowl, pan or pail, have tliem cold and beat with a bunch of wire 
until the froth is firm enough to hold up an egg, put in the sugar and a 
few drops of flavoring extract, and beat about half a minute longer. These 
meringues are to be hollow, mere shells of pasting, and to make them so 
they are placed on pieces of board that will not let the bottom cook. Cut 
some strips of paper two inches wide, plate them on boards that will go in 
the oven, drop large spoonfuls of tlie meringue paste on the paper and 
form them in egg shapes or round, smoothing tliem with a knife dipped in 
water, sift a litQe sugar over them, and dry, bake in a slack oven about 
twenty minutes. Too mucli heat will cause them to melt and go down. 
When they are cold take them off the paper, and with a knife scoop out 
the soft inside. These meringues can also have a little whipped cream in- 
side and be joined by twos together by the bottom. 

8t.\b Kisses. — A simple form of meringues made of the same paste or 
frosting as the foregoing. Prcxiure a thin star tube from the furnishing 
store, it is about the length of a finger and tlie point cut serrated. This is 
inserted in the point of a f uimol shaped bag, which is then filled with the 
paste, and star-shaped drops are pressed out on to baking pans slightly 
greased. They are baked to a light fa^^■n color and slip off the pans easi- 
ly when cool. No filling required. A sheet of paper can be pinned in 
shape and the point cut so as to do duty temporarily in place of tlie tube. 

Lemon Cheese Cakes. — ^Take one cup sugar, — eight ounces — ^three 
lemons, butter size of an egg, — ^two ounces — four to six yolks or three 
whole eggs. Cut the sugar, butter, grated rinds and juice of lemons into 
a sauce pan and boil, add eggs and stir till it becomes thick. This is best 
made in a custard kettle, — b:ettle within a kettle. This can be kept for 
use and when wanted, make tart shells, fill, cover with a meringue and 
brown delicately in oven; or make the delicious *' linger biscuit'* with 
eight ounces fine granulated sugar, four eggs, four tablespoons water, six 
ounces flour, — a heaping cup ; separate the eggs — white in bowl and yolks 
in mixing pan. Put water and sugar in with yolks and beat them with an 
egg whip ten minutes till a thick light batter, add the flour, then the well 
whipped whites. Fill a stiff paper comet with the point cut ojS (or a lady-

finger sack and tube) with the batter and press out finger lengths on to a 
sheet of manilla paper, sift powdered sugar over, shake off surplus and lay 
the sheet on a biding pan ; bake about six minutes, dampen the paper 
underside, take the cakes off and place by twos together. To make tbe 
"Dixie" cheese cakes, drop the above cake mixture in round cakes rather 
than finger-sha])ed, on sheet of paper, dredge with sugar, place paper in pan^ 
bake, remove as above and spread under side of each cake with lemoix 
mixture and place two together. They are perfectly delicious and served 
with ice cream make an elegant dessert 

Lemon Cheesk Caees-^MIx gently four tablespoons white sugar, odo 
half tablespoon butter, add yokes of two eggs, white of one, grated rind 
of three lemons, juice of one and a half, one small savory or sponge bis- 
cuit, some almonds blanched and pounded, three tablespoons of brandy; 
mix well and bake in tart tins lined with a rich puff paste, then cover 
wiih a meringue made of the well frothed white of one egg mixed 
lightly with one tablespoon sugar; return to oven and brown delicately. 

CREAMS. 

Caledonia Cream. — Beat together in a bowl for three quarters of an 
hour two ounces of rasberry jam, two of currant jelly, two of sifted loaf 
sugar and the whites of two eggs, previously whipped. A very pretty 
cream. — Carrie Wright^ KnoxviUSy Tenn. 

Frozen Whipped Cbeam. — One of the handsomest deserts or for an 
evening party are different creams frozen in glasses.' In winter time 
when cold enough, simply expose them to outer air, or in summer time 
place the glasses in a box or can of pounded ice. In whipping the 
cream it is best to set it on ice. The following recipes are some I have 
used : Coffee Cream : — Mix one quart thick cream, one cup each strong- 
black coffee and sugar in a tin pail or deep pan ; place on ice and whip 
with egg beater to a froth ; pile up in stem glasses, freeze as above and 
serve m same glasses. Chocolate Cream : — ^Put one cup milk over the fire- 
with one cup sugar and four oimces sweet chocolate (a cupful) grated and 
beat till it is all dissolved ; strain into another vessel and let cool ; whip one 
quart thick cream in a pail and add chocolate milk while whipping; flavor 
with vanilla and finish as above. Maraschino Cream : — Mix one quart 
cream, one cup marashino liquor, one-half cup sugar ; whip to a froth and 
finish as above. Vanilla Cream : — One .quart thick cream and three quart- 
ers cup sugar ; flavor with vanilla and whip to a froth ; pile in glasses and 
freeze as directed. — Mrs. L. Edwin Hocket^ New OrleajiSy La. 

Obangb Cream. — Soak half an ounce of Coxe's gelatine in half a gill 
of cold water ; and also the grated rind of one orange in the orange juice 
each half an hour ; then melt the gelatine over boiling water and add 
juice and rind and when quite hot, the yolks of two eggs (use whites for 
lemon ice) beaten with half a pint of sugar, stir till it thickens, add three- 
quarters of a pint of cream, and strain into a mould wet with cold water ; 
when cold serve with whipped cream. — Sadie Brtrunt, Chattanooga^ Tenn. 

Strawberry Cream. — First make small cases with fine bookpaper, like 
writing paper not ruled ; six sheets will make fifty cases by fitting a band 
of paper to the outside of a very small tumbler or wine glass or some 
similar small shape. The band of paper when cut to fit will form a curve. 
Cut as many such pieces as are needed from the sheets and then placing- 
three or four together ; cut both top and bottom edges into fringe a quarter 



POPULAR DIXIE DISHES, 9 

of an Inch or less In depth ; make some corn starch paste very stlfP and 
paste tiie ends of the bands together, forming cup shapes, then cut around 
the edges, press the fringed bottom edges of the cups on the paste, the 
fringe bent outward, and the cups are made. Now make a sponge cake ; 
beat together rapidly for ten minutes the yolks of fifteen eggs, three roun- 
ded cups sugar, {\% pounds) and one half cup water, then add four rounded 
cups flour, (18 ounces) and last, the well-frothed whites of fifteen eggs ; 
spread thickly on sheets of blank paper not greased, and bake in a 
quick oven about six minutes ; careful baking is necessary so it may not 
be dried or burned ; brush paper underside with water and pull it off ; 
should any of the sheets become too dry to roll or bend lay them on top 
of each other after wetting the paper and let lie half an hour ; cut out 
pieces of cake by same paper pattern the cases were cut by, but a trifle 
shorter and line the cases w^ith thejn ; no bottom of cake is needed, but 
little square pieces can be pushed down inside if wished. This recipe 
is for fifty cases, but the best way is to buy sheets of sponge cake at a 
baker^s as it will then be perfect and will roll or bend easily. A short time 
before serving fill the charlottes with the following cream : one quart 
strawberries, three pints thick sweet cream, one cup milk, one pound 
sugar, (two cups) one and a half ounce gelatine ; put fruit and sugar in a 
bowl, mash and rub through a seive ; disolve gelatine in the cup milk 
set where it will warm gradually ; when dissolved put cream in a pail, 
set on ice and with egg beater whip to a froth ; pour in gelatine, continue 
whipping, add strawberry pulp or syrup and when firm enough, befofe 
quite, fiU the charlottes with it. These must be kept in a cold place, 
and this is the case with all whipped cream. A plain cream without 
fruit or gelatine, flavored with strawberry extract can be used. — Mr». 
S. A. r., NaskmUe, Tmn, 

VAirtLUi Cream. — Two and one half cups milk boiled with one cup 
sugar, add one beaten egg, one tablespoon each of butter and com starch, 
the latter disssolved in half cup cold milk ; boil and stir for a few minutes 
and add one teaspoon vanilla. — Carrie E. Wood, KnoxviUe, Tenn.

good brown sugar ; after this has dissolved, strain wine and put into a new 
cask, cover bung with piece of muslin or perforated tin, let stand for a 
week, then cork lightly and let remain two weeks longer, cork tightiy ; the 
vessel must not be filled, leaving at least one-eight of space ; will be good 
in two or three months, when it should be drawn, bottled and sealed. This

when kept long; slice and squeeze lemons upon six tablespoons sugar, add 
a very little water, let stand fifteen minutes, then add two quarts water, ice 
well, stir and serve. 

Mint Cordial. — While dew is on pick mint without bruising, put two 
handfuls in a pitcher with quart French brandy, cover and let stand

gently so as not to break seed; stir occasionally until juice flows freely; 
measure .c:rapes and juice; to each measure of these, add half of pure 
water ; put all in barrrel and cover with false head weiglited down enough 
to keep grapes from rising above juice; let stand three days, remove head 
when hulls will rise and juice settle; on the fourth day draw off juice 
through spile hole into buckets, (covered with flannel to strain) and to each 
gallon of juice add two and a half pounds of fine sugar; pour into casks 
or stone jugs; never demijohns; let ferment in a cool phice ten or twelve 
days; draw off and clean vessel well, then burn a sulpliur match in it and 
return wine while fumes of match are still in vessel ; close mouth, IjBaviug 
only a small gimlet hole covered with netting; after a time net may be re- 
moved and cork put loosely in; do not cork tightly for six months; it may 
then be bottled or kept in cask. For cultivated grape use same recipe, 
using neither sugar nor water, however. For Bcuppernong and Whisca- 
chine use no water, but two and a half pounds of sugar to the gallon. 
Blackberry wine made in the same way. This is the best plan for making 
a large quantity of wine, and is certainly unequalled. — Mrs. Eckfordy At- 
lanta^ Ga. 

ENTREES. 

Brunswick Stew. — Stew one chicken or two squirrels in half gallon 
water until bones can be removed. Cook in separate saucepans six large 
ripe tomatoes, one half pint butter-beans and six ears of corn cut froiil cob,

and salt, split them, take out the white centers, broil them quickly, and put 
them on the hot dish, turning them over to cover tliem equally with the 
seasonings. Serve them hot, with a few sprigs of parsley or slices of lemon. 

To Pry Brains. — Soak several hours in weak brine to extract blood, 
drain and simmer four minutes in very little boiling water; handle lightly 
in forming round cakes; pepper them and use very little salt; have ready 
a beaten eggi with which cover top of cakes, sift over grated crackers, then

Cm c gBN PiLiiAU. — One pint milk, two well beaten eggs, half a pint cold 
minced chicken from which the outer skin has been previously removed, 
and enough cold boiled rice to make a thick batter ; season with salt, pepper 
and butter, and bake in a deep dish for twentnr minutes or until a light 
brown. A piUau of cold meats can be made by adding a little minced ham 
and onion to seasoning. — Mi»s Tyiton, Virginia. 

Daubb Froide. — One beef shin, chopped in several places to break 
bones, cook in just enough water to prevent burning, till it falls to pieces; 
after taking out bones, season with a heaping teaspoon flour rubbed into 
one of butter, red and black pepper, salt and celery seed; stew long 
enough to cook flour, then pour into a deep dish, cover with a plate, placing 
on weights to press it. To be eaten cold as souse. — Mrs. C. M. A. 

Liver Pudding — Clean well two hogs' heads, two livers, two lights, six 
sweet breads, six kidneys split open and all of the good part off six milts; 
soak in tub of soft water over night ; next morning Ijoil until done, adding 
two slices of fat pork, take up, cool slightly and grind in sausage mill; 
while grinding add some of the grease taken off kettle. When ground 
season with black pepper, salt and onions (chopped fine) to taste. If not 
rich enough, boil more middling or pork and add. If stuffed boil again a 
few minutes. 

Meat Puffs. — ^Roll a sheet of good paste and cut into circular shapes by 
pressing a saucer upon it and passing a sharp knife around tlie saucer ; lay 
upon the half of each circle of paste, a tablespoon of any kind of meat, 
poultry, flsh, oysters, etc., minced fine and seasoned to taste ; moisten with 
wine or cati^up ; fold over the other half, crimp the edges and bake or fry. 
Serve hot or cold. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — Pare and rub with a little salt, throw in sauce pan 
without water , let stew until tender ; add a small piece of butter, cream or 
milk, pepper and salt; let tliem l)e rather stiff with gravy, will take three

when thick serve. To dry mushrooms peel and cut from stalks ; dry gently 
in a mcxlerate oven, put them away in a tight can and keep from dampness. 

Potted Rabbits. — Two small rabbits or one large one, one pound fat 
bacon or fresh butter, one of veal, liver of rabbits, salt, pepper and spices ; 
cut rabbit in pieces, put in stone jar, cut veal and bacon in large dice, mix

salt and fill spaces between pieces of rabbit with this mixture, lay a thin 
slice of bacon and one bay leaf on top, cover with a lid of plain paste made 
of flour and water only; set jar in a pan or pot of water; bake in a slow 
oven three or four hours; a greased paper on top will prevent paste 
burning ; when done and cold pick meat from bones of rabbit, and pound 
to a paste with veal and bacon, and if any gravy remains in jar, cook very 
low and mix with meat; taste for seasoning; press firmly into smtdl jars 
or cups, cover top with melted butter, keep well covered in a cool place. 
Potted meats keep for months, and can be used as needed. Potted rabbits 
make delightful sandwiches using split baking powder biscuits buttering 
one half, spreading meat on the other.

ToNOTTE ToAfiT. — ^Take cold well boiled tongue, minced fine, mix well 
with cream or a little milk ; add l)eaten yolk one egg, aimmer slowly; toast 
thin Blices stale bread, butler and spread in a flat, heated dish, cover with 
tOD^e and serve quicklv. — Mitt. S. 

Ragout of Swekt 6rk.vd8 and Mushbooms. — Two or three large 
sweetbreads, or one pound; one-half can of mushrooms; two ounces uf 
butter — aixe of an egi;; one t^iblespoonful of flour; little minced onion and 
ham for seasoning; juice of one lemon; cayenne and salt; fried shapes of 
bread for the border; take the sweetbreads already cooked and cold, and 
cut them into large dice. Make the sauce for them in a deep saucepan, 
first putting in half the butter, a large teaspoonful of minced onion and a 
very thin slice of ham and when these are cooked enough for flavor with- 
out browning put in the flour and stir the mixture over the fire until it 
begins to color. Then add gradually the mushroom liquor and a cupful of 
the liquor the sweetbretids were boiled in ; let it boil up and become thick. 
Add a pinch of cayenne. Next, melt the other piece of butter in a frying 
pan, put in the mushrooms and the cut of sweetbreads and shake them 
about over the fire until they begin to show color ; take it off, squeeze 
in the juice of the lemon and then strain in tiie thick sauce from the other 
vessel. Dish them heaped up in tlie centre of a flat platter, or of small 
dishes for individual orders, and place a border of thin shapes of bread 
fried in lard around the edge. Fried crusts or shapes for garnishing. In 
a case where economy is not in question, the handsomest shape for a border 
can be made by taking a stale, long and narrow loaf of bread and trimming 
down on both sides to some pattern (like a piece of carperter^s mouldings), 
so that when it is sliced up with a sharp knife the slices will be heart- 
shaped, or leaf or club or spade-shaped, etc., and all alike. Simple 
triangles may be set up on edge around a large dish, and fastened to stand 
by dipping the bottoms in ^^q and then making the dish hot enough to dry 
it This makes a raised case, into which a ragout like that of the foregoing 
receipt may be poured. Or a long and slender leaf shape may be laid on 
the small dish, projecting well over the side, and the ragout of fricas.se 
dished upon the end of it. All these shapes are first to be fried, either in 
lard or the clear part of melted butter. They take but about one minute 
in the fat, when it is hot, and need care to have them all of a nice even 
color. Cold rolls and slices can be used in similar ways. 

FISH. 

BoiiiED Fish with Vegetables. — Put a whole fish in kettle, and cover 
with stock made as follows : Fry in a saucepan two onions, a carrot, a piece 
of celery or celery-seed, a tablespoon butter, one of fiour, a sprig of parsley, 
a teaspoon of whole black peppers, and three cloves ; add two and a half 
(marts of water, two teacups vinegar, boil twenty minutes, salt and skim, 
roar this over the fish, and boil gently until done. Serve with egg sauce.

Browt7 Fish Soup. — ^Any kind of fish will answer, cut in small pieces, 
roll in flour, and brown in some olive oil or butter in a saucepan ; cover 
with hot water. Season with salt and pepper, and boil slowly for about 
fifteen minutes. See that there is plenty of water. One pound will make 
a quart of soup. A clove of garlic may be added. — Mrs. F. H. if..

BoiledHaddock WITH Parsley Sauce. — ^Take a threepound haddock 
as soon as it comes from market, wash it tlioroughly, and lay it in a large 
pan containing plenty of cold water and a handful of salt. When it is 
time to cook it, put it into the fish-kettle with cold water enough to cover 
it ; a gill of vinegar ; a tablespoonf ul of salt, the root of the parsle}', six 
cloves, and one sprig each of thyuie and marjoram. Set the kettle over the 
fire and bring it to a lx>il. By the time the kettle boils the fish is usually 
done, but it may ])e tested by pulling out a fin, if the fin comes out easily 
and the flesh of the fish looks clear white, it is done. Lift the kettle oS 
the fire, and let tlie fish stand in tlie water until wanted for use. Make the 
• sauce by stirring together over the fire one ounce or one tablespoonf ul each 
of butter and fiour, until they bubble. Then stir in half a pint of boiling 
water, or a little more, if the fiour tliickeus the sauce. Move the sauce to 
the side of tlie fire, chop the parsley fine and add it to the sauce with a 
saltspoon each of pepper and grated nutmeg ; the sauce will tlien be ready 
to use. To spr\-e tlie fish, take it up carefully without breaking, remove 
the skin by scraping it gently so as to avoid tearing the fish, pour the sauce 
over it, and it will be ready for the table. Haddocks are at their best in 
November, December, June and July. But any fish can be cooked by this 
recipe. — Mrs. L. A.^ TvHUihoma. 

Creoled HALiBirr. — Get a thick square piece of halibut, wash and 
place over a baking dish, season with salt and pepper, chop a clove of 
white garlic about the size of a bean,and strew over the fish, then put on a 
cup of fresh or canned tomatoes. Bake until the flakes separate ; dish up 
witiiout breaking. The combination of garlic and tomatoes gives the 
name of Creole to the dish. 

B-vked Herri>'gs. — Scale and clean two pounds of lierrings carefully 
without washing, unless tliis be absolutely necessary. Sj)lit them do'wn 
the back and remove the backbones. S])rinkle tliem in.'tide witli a little 
pepper, salt and powdered mace mixed together ; if therfe are any roes 
enclose tliem in the flesh, and lay the hitter in layers in a deep baking dish 
with half a dozen whole cloves, the same nnnber of peppercorns and two 
bay leaves between them. Cover with vinegar and water equally mixed, 
Sftlt plentifully, tie a sheet of oil paper over the dish, and 1>ake one hour. 
These are in season in February, March and April. — Mrs. Capt. Howe^ 
Nashville^ Ttnn. 

To PUT UP Herrings for Family Use. — Mix three pecks each of fine 
and rock salt; take one thousand herrings, put them loosely in layers with 
salt between, after four days, drain well and repack in close layers on their 
» backs covering each layer with a mixture of three pecks each of fine and 
rock salt, one and a half pounds brown sugar, one fourth pound of saltpeter. 
Leave several months until salt takes effect.

derilled crabs. 

Otster Salad. — ^Three dozen fresh oysters, two heads of celery with 
part of their green tops, about half as much tender white cabbage ; after 
washing the celery and cabbage tlirow them into boiling salted water, let 
boil five minutes, pour off the hot water and drain and chop them fine. 
Add an equal quantity of vinegar, some broken pepper-corns, pepper-sauce 
and salt ;- put in the oysters and keep shaking tlie pan while they are scald- 
ing that tliey may be set in round and plump shape ; do not let them boil, 
drain and set them away on a dish to become ice cold. When to be served 
season the chopped celery slightly with oil and vinegar ; spread part of it

the rest of the celery on top of them; smooth the top a little and pour 
mayonaise sauce, or a tartare sauce without the minced onion or gherkin, 
over just thin enough to run. Pickled or minced oysters answer well for 
salad as above instead of the fresh. 

Oysters A2n> Macaroni. — A third of a package of macaroni, one cup 
of oysters, one cup milk, one egg, one tablespoon flour, pepper and salt; 
boil macaroni alone in salt water twenty minutes and drain dry, butter the 
bottom of a three pint baking dish or pudding pan, put in half the maca-

salt and pepper and cover with rest of macaroni, moisten the spoonful of 
flour wnth a little milk, beat in the egg, then the rest of milk and oyster 
liquor, if any, pour in the pan and bake about twen^ minutes or until set; 
Uie water should be at boiling point wiien macaroni is first put in. 

A PiLLAU OF Fish. — ^Take two parts of any kind cold cooked fish, one 
part cold mashed potatoes; mince fish very fine and mix with potatoes and 
three hard boiled eggs cut fine. To one quart of this mixture, add table-

Neapolitan Ice Cream. — ^Three different colored Ices placed In layers 
in a brick-shaped mold and frozen solid enough to be cut In ^ces. Nea- 
politan molds can be bought at the house-funiishing stores. They are 
of about the size and shape of a cigar box ; but top and bottom can be 
taken off; some have the top lid stamped in a fruit shape like a jelly mold. 
There Is no particular rule as to what kind of ices shall be used; tliere may be 
caramel ice cream, which Is brown, or chocolate, coffee or burnt almond, or 
white pure cream or yellow custard, with a pink, red or purple fruit ice for 
the middle layer. Make the yellow boiled custard: one quart of thin 
cream, twelve ounces of sugar, twelve yolks of eggs, vanilla l^an or extract 
to flavor. Boll the cream with the sugar and a vanilla bean in it. Beat 
the yolks light and pour the boiling cream to them. Set on tlie fire again 
and boil for a minute. This yellow custard will not become frothy, rich 
and light in tiie freezer if cooked much, but should be taken oft and 
strained as soon as slightly thickened. Set the freezer containing it in its 
tub and pack with ice pounded fine and mixed with one-fifth as much 
coarse salt Turn the freezer and when the contents are nearly frozen; if

X)ound of sugar, one quart of water, juice of one lemon. Mash the grapes 

and sQ^ar together raw, add the lemon juice and water, strain into a freezer 

with all the pulp obtainable and freeze at once. The lemon juice brightens 

the color. Small quantities like the preceeding can be frozen in tin pails 

set in a mixture of finely pound(^d ice and salt in a tub, if kept constantly 

in moticm, though proper freezers, of course, are better. AVlien all three 

are frozen lay a sheet of thi:i paper on the bottom lid of the mold to make 

a tii^ht fit; place the mold, spread in the tliree layers with a spoon evenly, 

put on paper, tlien the lul; till the crevice along the edge of the paper with 

a little melted butter to keep out the salt water, then put the mold down in 

the freezing mixture, cover it well with ice and salt and let it remain two 

or three hours. WHien to be served wash off the mold in cold water and 

wipe dry, take off the lids and paper and place the tri-colored brick of 

cream on a folded napkin on a dish, or a silver dish having a perforated 

bottom drainer. Where a large quantity of this fashionable ice is made to 

serve at dinners that last for hours, tlie bricks are taken out of the molds 

early, wrapped in manilla paper and packed in a large ice cream freezer, 

there to remain frozen until they are taken out one by one as wanted. —

the pulp and use all the water ; sweeten to taste and freeze as other ice. 
If wished very light add well-frothed whites of three eggs, to one gallon

French Candy. — ^This recipe is used by all confectioners. The whites 
of two eggs placed in a tumbler ; measure with your finger how high it 
comes up in the glass, pour it out in a large bowl, pour in the tumbler as 
much cold water as will be equal to amount of the eggs ; mix it with them 
and beat very well ; add a desert spoon of vanilla and about two pounds con- 
fectioners* sugar if you can get it fit has the appearance of flour) --or 
powdered sugar well sifted ; beat well and the foundation of all your candy 
is ready ; take one half pound dates, remove the stones, put in a piece of 
the candy dough, roll each one in granulated sugar ; split one half pound 
figs and place a layer of the dough on a board, sprinkled well with powder- 
ed sugar to prevent its adhereing, and then a layer of figs ; again a layer of 
dough, cut in squares, and that kind is read^. Nuts of any kind may be 
made up into the candy Almonds put inside and then rolled In coarse 
sugar ; set each kind out in a cool place to harden. For chocolate creams, 
roll any number of balls from the dough, and when the^ are hardened, dip 
with a fork into chocolate melted on the stove; be careful not to allow it to 
boil ; use baker's chocolate. Cocoanut can be made by rolling out another 
portion of dough on the board, sprinkle cocoanut over it and roll a few 
times with the roller, then cut in squares. A mixture of cocoanut and ' 
particles of nuts chopped fine makes a very delicious candy. The English 
walnut makes a handsome addition if you are to give boxes of this candy 
as presents to friends. Split the walnuts, shape some of the dough into 
round flat balls, and place a leaf on each side ; press together firmly. This 
candy is now being made in society circles a great deal, as there is no 
cooking to be done and it is very easy and clean work. A dollar's worth 
of all uiese ingredients together, will make many pounds of candy. — 3£n,

carefully; mince and slired a pound of beef suet. Mix with these in a 
large pan a pound of st;ile bread crumbs and half a pound of sifted flour. 
Beat together in another pan the yolk of six eggs, add three quartern pint 
of creain or milk, then the well-frothed wiiites and pour this over the suet, 
flour, etc., and stir and mi.\ t\w wliole well together, adding one gratod 
■utmeg, tablespoonful cinnamon, half toa-spoonful each ginger and ground 
cloves, teaspoonful salt, one pound pulverized sugar. Boil briskly six 
hours in a cloth dipped in boiling water and then flour thickly on tlie inside 
or in an ornamental mold tied up in aclotli. Have a large pot with plenty 
of water. To take out of pot without breaking, dip into cold water for a 
minute or two, then place it in a round, bottomed basin that will just hold

invert the whole so that the paddins: may rest on the dish, lift off basin 
and remove cloth. The use of the cold water is to chill and solidify the 
surface so that it may part from the clotli smoothly. Plum pudding may 
also be baked (two hours) or steamed (three hours), m a well buttered mold 
or pan, but it is then better with ti^'o teaspoonf uls baking powder. 

SOUPS AND VEGETABr.ES. 

Gumbo Fillet. — Joint and dredge well with flour a full ^rown chicken; 
put in a pot witli sufficient lard to fr}' it, adding a sliced onion. B© care- 
ful not to burn it. Wien fried, add two quarts of boiling water, a slic^ of 
■Jiam trimmed free from the coarse fat, salt, black and red pepper, a few 
cloves and grains of allspice if liked; stew until soup is rich with pieces 
of chicken; turn into tureen and add one tablespoon of fillet if fresh, two 
if not fre»sli ; stir well to avoid lumping, and do no.t cover after adding 
fillet; add as many oysters as you please; they must previously be cooked. 
but not more than five minutes. The soup is best made by adding liquor 
of one quart of oysters to two quarts boiling water. Fillet is pulverized 
sassafras leaves dried and sifted; can be made at home readily. — iVrs. S., La. 

To Can Corn. — Put the corn raw into tin cans, then fill with cold water 
even with the top of the com; solder up tlie can, pricking a small hole in 
the cover. Solder that also. Boil the cans and contents in boiling water 
two and a half hours; then with a hot iron open the small hole and let the 
gas blow out, after which solder up and boil again two and a half hours 
and set away for use. Peas, string beans and Lima beans can be put up in 
tlie same way. 

Sweet Potatoes. — Boil or stew large potatoes until nearly done ; take 
out, peel and slice, not quite half an inch thick. Put in baking pan with 
very little water ; sprinkle thickly with white sugar and spread each slice 
with butter ; brown in oven. Carolina style and a favorite dish all over the 
South.— ifVv. EckfcTd, AtlarUa, Go. 



A TEAR'S BILL OF PARE. 



The following airangement of " Bills of Fare" for every day in the year 
was arranged for the latitude of Waahington— aa nearly a medium as could 
be found— by a lady, Southern bom and bred, who now resides in that city. 
Housekeepers, North and South, can easily adapt it to their own peculiar 
wants, and will, we belieye, find it suggestive and helpful. 

The recipes referred to are all contained in this book, and may be quickly 
found by reference to the alphabetical index. The bills of fare are not, of 
course, arbitrary, but are intended to suggest such a variety as will meet the 
wants of the whole family. The arrangement was made for a year beginning 
with Thursday. When the current year begins earlier, the last day or days 
of December may be used to precede those here given for January, and the 
dates changed on the margin with a soft pencil, so that they may be readily 
erased and changed again for subsequent years. A daily reference to these 
pages will, we feel sure, save the housewife much puzzling over the question, 
"What shall we have for dinner?" 

For the sake of brevity, coffee, tea, chocolate, letnonade in hot weather, 
and milk in cold weather, have not been mentioned in the bills of fare. 
They are of course appropriate to any meal, and are to be used according 
to taste. Soup, as a regular dinner course, is always in order, following 
oysters raw when the latter are in season. Soups vary in name far more 
than in quality. Much of the slop served as soup a la this, that and the 
other, would not, except for the name, be recognized as something to be 
taken into the human stomach. This, however, may be a matter of small 
Importance when a bountiful dinner of good things is to follow, but in 
cases where healthy stomachs are demanding supplies, a really good soap, 
with or without name, is heartily relished, and is very wholesome as pre- 
paring the way for more solid food. In any family where soup is relished 
a sufficient supply may be made daily, or as often as desired, with but little 
trouble and trifling addition to the regular expenses. 

Fresh iish, as a separate course, comes next in order. Large fish of some 
sort are usually considered most elegant, either baked or boiled, for dinner, 
and they are really very nice when they can be procured freshly killed and 
dripping with their native waters. 

Bread is always an accompaniment of every course at dinner, bread and 
butter being more properly a part of dessert Cheese is to most persons 
a pleasant titbit at dessert, and pickles, of one or another variety, appro- 
priate to the dishes served, are seen on the table at nearly every meal. 

On Sunday, in most families, the dinner is delayed until two or three 
o'clock and the supper omitted entirely, and in winter when the days are 
abort, especially in the more northern States, two meals a day is the rule 

(879) 



380 A YEARS BILL OF FARE, 

for every day. In large cities, too, where business hours are fewer, and 
the men of the household lunch down town on account of the distance 
residences are from business, the dinner is delayed until later iu the day, 
and the bill of fare varied accordingly. 

Fruits, in their natural state, are too much neglected at the tables of 
people in moderate circumstances. Pies, puddings and other compounds, 
made partly of fruit, are generally less wholesome and really less palata- 
table than the fruit itself iu a natural state or with- some simple dreasing. 
In most localities berries in their season are not costly. Strawberries, 
resh, ri|)e and luscious, for breakfast, dinner and supper, can not be snb- 
.stituted by any thing more agreeable and refreshing, and as the season 
for this fruit is always short it is scarcely possible to weary of them. 
Scarcely less delicious are the raspberries, blackberries and huckleberries 
which follow soon. Then come ripe watermelons, cantelopes, nutmeg and 
musk melons and grapes, peaches and pears. Those who raise their own 
melons will need no instruction on the subject of serving and eating 
them. After the fruit is well grown, a good shotgun and a keen eye on 
the ''patch" is all that is necessary to secure a t\\^ crop. But to the 
dainty housekeeper who must buy her melon after a week or two of 
shipping, reshipping, trans|x)rting and handling, until it has cost nearly 
its weight in gold, the best instructions are: Get your melon as fresh as 
possible; let it remain on ice several hours or all night; if it cute crisp, 
and has ripe seeds and tastes well flavored, cut the ends off and set up 
on a dish ; divide both halves through the middle and serve in long slices 
or cut in rings ; pass a waiter to receive the rinds. But if the meat of 
the melon api)ears wilted or withered, or is not perfectly ripe, pass it to 
the four-footed beasts, where it should have gone in the first place. Thoee 
who can afford the more costly tropical fruit, such as bananas and pine 
apples, should slice them as thin as ]X)ssible, place in the prettiest and 
shallowest glass fruit-stands, and cover well with sugar for some time before 
serving. 

Suggestions for the tasteful decoration of tlie table will be found under 
"The Dining Room."

Note.— Observe that these bills of fare are made with especial reference to the ordixiary 
routine of the week in the kitchen, the meals for each day being planned to save labor 
and fuel, and to interfere as little as possible with the special work of the day. Thus 
Monday's bill of fare will not fit any other day of the week, if Monday is set apart as 
washing day. The housekeeper should aim at variety on successive meals rather 
than in the same meal, rememDering that a few dishes daintiiy cooked and served make 
a far more attractive dinner than many dishes less perfectly cooked and served. 

ADDITIONAL BILLS OF FARE. 

New Year*8 Table. — ^When receiving calls on New Year's day, the table 
should be handsomely arranged and decorated, and provided with rather 
substantial dishes, such as would suit the taste of gentlemen. Too great 
profusion, especially of cakes, confectionery, and ices, is out of taste. Selec- 
tions may be made from the following: Escaloped oysters; cold tongue, 
turkey, chicken, and ham, pressed meats, boned turkey, jellied chicken; 
sandwiches or wedding sandwich rolls ; pickled oysters, chicken and lobster 
salads, cold slaw garnished w^ith fried oysters ; bottled pickles, French or 
Spanish pickles; jellies; charlotte-russe, 'ice-creams, ices; two large hand- 
some cakes for decoration of table, and one or two baskets of mixed cake, 
fruit, layer, and sponge cake predominating ; fruits; nuts; coffee, chocolate 
with whipped cream, lemonade. 

Refreshments. — For small evening parties, sociables, receptions, etc., 
where the refreshments are handed round or are served on a siaeboard, and 
are of a simple character, every thing should be excellent in the highest 
degree, delicately prepared, and attractively served. Sandwiches and coffee, 
chocolate or tea, a variety of nice cake, jellies, ice-cream or ices, and fruits 
are appropriate. For a more pretentious occasion, a simple table prettily 
decorated with flowers, and set with fruit, lobster salad, chicken croquettes, 
pickled oysters, and one or two kinds of ice-cream and cake, and coffee and 
tea is quite enough. 

Refreshments for Twenty. — For a company of twenty allow one gallon 
oysters, four chickens and eight bunches of celery for chicken salad, fifty 
sandwiches, one gallon of ice-cream, two molds charlotte-russe, two quarts 
of lemon jelly, one light and one dark fruit cake, two layer cakes, and one 
white or sponge cake; for coffee use one and a half pints ground coffee and 
one gallon of w^ater; fruit cake especially, and, indeed, all rich cake, should 
be cut in thin slices with a keen-edged knife ; a small piece of each variety is 
always preferred to a plate overloaded with one or two kinds. 

Refreshments for a Hundred. — For a larger company of a hundred the 
refreshments may be more elal)orate: Two gallons of pickled oysters; two 
large dishes of lobster salad; two small haras boiled and sliced cold, five cold 
tongues sliced thin, twelve chickens jellied or pressed, each dish gamish<»d 
with sprigs of jiarsley, slices of lemon and red beets, or curled leaves of 
celery, or the tender center leaves of lettuce; two gallons of bottled pickles 
or a gallon and a half of home-made; twelve dozen biscuit sandwiches ; five 
quarts jelly, four gallons ice-cream ; fifteen large cakes, to be made from 
recipes for rich fruit, delicate, layer, and sponge cakes ; twelve dozen each of 
almond macaroons and variety puffs; four large dishes of mixed fruits; five 
pounds roasted coffee and five gallons water, which should be served at the 
Deginning, and six gallons of iced lemonade to serve at the close. 

Refreshments for One Hundred and Seventy-Five. — Six gallcais oys- 
ters; three small hams, five large turkeys, ten tongues; six chickens and 
twelve bunches of celery for salad; three gallons pickles; seventeen dozen. 



BILLS OF FARE. 405 

buti^, twelve loaves bread made in wedding sandwich rolls or in plain sand- 
wiches; twenty-two large cakes; fifteen dozen large oranges sliced, seventeen 
dozen meringues, tifteeii dozen pears, thirty pounds grapes; seven gallons ice- 
cream and four gallons lemon ice ; coffee made of twelve pints ^ound coffee 
and eight gallons water ; serve colfee at the beginning, and lemonade at the 
close. 

FOR THE PICNIC. 

In the "Sunny South," picnics are in order as early as April, but in the 
more northern latitudes should never be attempted before the latter part of 
May or June, and September and October are the crowning months for them 
around the northern lakes, where hunting ajid fishing give zest to the sports. 
First, he up "at live o'clock in the mornmg," in order to have the chicken, 
biscuit, etc., freshly baked. Provide two baskets, one for the provisions, aiut 
the other for dishes and utensils, which should include the following : Table- 
cloth and an oil-cloth to put under it, napkins, towels, plates, cups, forks, a 
few knives and table-spoons, tea-spoons, sauce dishes, tin cups (or tumblers, if 
the picnickers are of the over-fastidious variety); a tin bucket, for water, in 
which a bottle of cream, lemons, oranges, or other fruit may be carried to the 
scene of action; i^nother with an extra close cover, partly filled with made 
chocolate, wliich may be readily reheated by setting in an old tin pail or pan 
in which water is kept boiling a la custard-kettle; a frying-pan; a coffee-pot, 
with the amount of prepared coffee needed tied in a coarse, white flannel 
bag; a tea-pot, with tea m a neat paj^ier package ; tin boxes of salt, pepper, 
ana sugar; a tin box for butter (if carried) placed next to block of ice, which 
should be well wrapped with a blanket and put in a shady corner of the pic- 
nic wagon. For extra occasions, add a freezer filled with frozen cream, with 
ice well packed around it, and heavily wrapped with carpeting. To pack the 
basket, nrst j>ut in plates, cups, and sauce dishes carefully with the tow- 
els and napkixis, and paper if needed ; then add the rest, fitting them in 
tightly, ana covering all with the table-cloth, and over it the oil-cloth. Tie 
the coffee and tea-pots, well wrapped up, and the frying-pan to the handles. 
Pack provision basKet as full as the law allows, or as the nature of the occa- 
sion and the elasticity of the appetites demand. 

The following bills of fare may be picked to pieces and recombined to suit 
tastes and occasions:

FRAGMENTa 



Mother's hash does n't taste of soap grease, rancid batter, spoiled cheese^ 
raw flour, boarding-house skillets, hotel coffee, garden garlics, bologna sau- 
sage, or cayenne pepper; neither is it stewed and simmered and simmered 
and stewed, but is made so nicely, seasoned so delicately, and heated through 
00 quickly, that the only trouble is, ** there is never enough to go round."' 
Cold meat of any kind will do, but corned beef is best ; always remove all 
surplus fat and bits of gristle, season with salt and pepper, chop fine, and to 
one-third of meat add two-thirds of chopped cold boiled potato, and one 
onion chopped very fine; place in the dripping-pan, dredge with a little 
flour, and pour in at the side of the pan enough water to come up level with 
the hash, place in oven, and do not stir; when the flour is a light-brown, and 
has formed a sort of crust, take out, add a lump of butter, stir it through 
fleveral times, and you will have a delicious hash. Or, by cooking longer, it 
may be made of cold raw potatoes, which peel, slice, and let lie in salt and 
water a half hour before chopping. If of meat and potatoes, always use the 
proportions given above, and before chopping, season with pepper and salt, 
and a chopped onion if you like (if onions are not to be had, take tliem out 
of pickle jar), place in hot skillet with just enough water to moisten, add a 
little butter or some nice beef drippings, stir often until warmed through, 
cover and let stand on a moderately hot part of the stove fifteen minutes. 
When ready to dish, run the knife under and fold as you would an omelet, 
and serve hot with tomato catsup. In making hash meats may be combined 
if there is not enough of a kind. Do not make hash or any other dish greasy. 
It is a mistaken idea to think that fat and butter in large quantities are 
necessary to good cooking. Butter and oils may be melted without changing 
their nature, but when cooked they become much more indigestible and 
injurious to weak stomachs. 



AFTER THANKSGIVING DINNER, 



a most excellent hash may be made thus : Pick meat off turkey bones, shred 
it in small bits, add dressing and pieces of light biscuit cut up fine, mix 
together and put into dripping-pan, pour over any gravy that was left, add 
water to thoroughly moisten, but not enough to make it sloppy; place in a 
hot oven for twenty minutes, and, when eaten, all will agree that the turkey 
is better this time than it was at first; or warm the remnants of the turkey 
over after the style of escaloped oysters (first a layer of bread-crumbs, then 
minced turkey, and so on); or add an egg or two and make nice breakfast 
croquettes. The common error ,^n heating over meats of all kinds is pitting

into a cold skillet, and cooking a long time. This second cooking is more 
properly only heating, and should be quickly done. All such dishes should 
he served hot with some sort of tart jelly. Always save a can of currant 
juice (after filling jelly cups and glasses), from which to make jelly in the 
'Winter, and it will taste as fresh and delicious as when made in its season. 

ALWAYS SAVE 

all the currants, skimmings, pieces, etc., leftafter making jelly, place in astone 
jar, cover with soft water previously boiled to purify it, let stand several 
days ; in the meantime, take your apple peelings, without the cores, and pu r 
on in porcelain kettle, cover with water, boil twenty minutes, drain into a 
large stone jar ; drain currants also into this jar, add all the rinsings from 
your molasses jugs, all dribs of syrups, etc., and when jar is full, drain off 
-all that is clear into vinegar keg (where, of course, you have some good cider 
vinegar to start with). If not sweet enough, add brown sugar or molasses, 
oover the bung-hole with a piece of coarse netting, and set in the sun or by 
the kitchen stove. In making vinegar always remember to give it plenty ol 
air, and it is better to have the cask or barrel (which should be of oak) only 
half full, so that the air may pass over as large a surface as possible. Vine- 
gar must also have plenty of material, such as sugar, molasses, etc., to work 
u}X)n. Never use alum or cream of tartar, as some advise, and never let your 
vinegar freeze. Paint your barrel or cask if you would have it durabla. 
Company, sickness, or other circumstances may prevent making 

SWEBT PICKLES 

in their season, but they can be prepared very nicely at any time, by taking 
pear, peach, plum, or apple preserves, and pouring hot spiced vinegar over 
them ; in a few days they will make a delightful relish. It very often hap- 
pens in putting up cucumber pickles that you can only gather or buy a few 
at a time ; these can be easily pickled in the following manner : Place in a 
|ar, sprinkle with salt, in the proportion of a pint salt to a peck cucumbers, 
cover with boiling water, let stand twenty-four hours, drain, cover with 
fresh hot water; after another twenty-four hours, drain, place in a jar, and 
€over with cold, not very strong vinegar ; continue to treat each mess in this 
manner, using the tyro jars, one for scalding and the other as a final recep- 
tacle for the pickles, until you have enough, when drain and cover with 
boiling cider vinegar, add spices, and in a few days they will be ready for 
use. Never throw away even 

A CRUMB OP BREAD, 

but save it and put with other pieces ; if you have a loaf about to mold, cut 
!n thin slices, place all together in a dripping-pan and set in oven to dry, 
and you will find that when pounded and rolled it will be very nice for 
dressing, staffing, puddings, griddle-cakes, etc. When to be used for bread- 
ing meats, etc., it must be made very fiihc. Keep in a covered box, or in a 
paper bag tied securely and hung in a dry place. It is much more economi- 
cal to prepare meats with a dressing of some kind, since they '*go so much 
further." 



408 FRAGMENTS. 

Sausage Toabt is made by scalding the sausages in boiling water, frying 
to light brown, chop tine, and spread on bits of toast. 

Ham BALLs.^-Chop fine, cold, cooked ham ; add an egg for each person, and 
a little flour; beat together, make into balls, and fry brown in hot Dutter. 

Corn-Meal Cakb. — Two-thirds cup butter^ one cup sugar, three eggs 
beaten separately, two and a half cups corn meal, one and a half of floar, 
two of sweet milk, f^'o tea-spoons cream tartar, oqe of soda. 

Philadelphia Scrapple.— Mix potatoes (or any cold vegetables) and meat, 
turn into a skillet with meat gravy from previous day. Stir up until dry 
and crisp, resembling a very dry luush ; serve in small deep dish. 

To Clarify Molasses. — Heat over the fire and pour in one pint of sweet 
milk to each gallon of molasses. The impurities rise in scum to the top, 
which must be skimmed off before the boiling breaks it. Add the milk as 
soon as placed over the fire, mixing it thoroughly with the molasses. 

Cucumber Relish may be made of the large cucumbersA Pare and cue in 
two, take out seeds, and grate, strain out most of the water, season highly 
with pepper and salt, add a little sugar, and as much vinegar as you hare 
cucumbers ; put in small bottle and seal. 

Beefsteak Toast. — Chop cold steak or tongue very fine, cook in a little 
water, put in cream or milk, thicken, season with butter, salt, and pepper, 
and pour it over slices of toast. Prepare boiled ham in the same way, adcung 
the yolk of an egg. 

Breakfast Puffs may be made on baking day, by taking up a little 
dough, pulling out to thickness of doughnuts, cut two and one-half inches 
in length, drop in boiling lard, and fry like doughnuts; to be eaten with 
butter like biscuit. 

Shelled Almonds are more economical for use in cakes. One pound 
of unshelled almonds only makes six and one-half ounces or one co^-cnp- 
ful when shelled, while the unshelled are generally only double the price, 
and sometimes not that per pound. 

Mixed Sandwiches. — Chop fine, cold ham, tongue and chicken ; mix with 
one pint of the meat half a cup melted butter, one table-spoon salad-oil, one 
of mustard if desired, the yolk of a beaten egg, and a little pepper ; spread 
on bread cut thin and buttered. Ham alone may be prepared in this way. 

Steak Pudding. — Mix one quart flour, one pound suet (shredded fine), a 
little salt, and cold water to make stiff as for pie-crusty roll out half an inch 
thick ; have steak (beef or mutton) well seasoned with pepper and salt^ lay 
them on the paste and roll it up, tie in a cloth, and boil tliree hours. Some 
add a few oysters and a sliced onion to the steak. 

Mutton Pie and Tomatoes. — Spread the bottom of a baking-dish with 
bread-crumbs, and fill with alternate layers of cold roast mutton, cut in thin 
slices, and tomatoes, peeled and sliced; season each layer with pepper, salt 
and bits of butter. The last layer should be of tomatoes spread with bread- 
crumbs. Bake three-quarters of an hour, and serve immeaiately. 

Lancashire Pie. — Take cold beef or veal, chop, and sea.son as for hash; 
have ready hot mashed potatoes seasoned as if tor the table, and put in a 
shallow baking-dish first a layer of meat, then a layer of potatoes, and so on, 
till dish is heaping full ; smooth over top of potatoes, and make little holes 
in- which place bits of butter; bake until a nice brown. 

Bread-crumbs for Pastry. — Many puddings that are commonly baked in 
a crust, such as cocoa-nut, potato, apple, and lemon, are equally as good and 
more wholesome, made by strewing grated bread-crumbs over a buttered 
pie-plate or pudding-dish to the usual depth of crust ; pour in the pudding, 
strew another layer of bread-crumbs over the top, and oake. 

Squab Pie. — Trim a deep dish with paste as for chicken pie, put in a laver 
of sliced sour apples, season with sugar and spice ; add a layer of fresh, rather 
lean pork, sliced thin, seasoned with salt and pepper; and thus place alter- 
nate layers of apple and pork until the dish is nearlv full; put in a little 
water and cover with paste ; bake slowly until thoroughly done. 



FBAGMENTS. 409 

Mabsh Mallow Paste. — ^Dissolve one poand of clean gum arabic in one 
a«art of water ; strain, add one pound ol refined sugai\ and place over the 
nie, stirring continually until the sugar is dissolved ana the mixture has be- 
come the consistency of honey. Next, add gradually the whites of eight 
eggB well beaten, stirring the mixture all the time, until it loses its sticki- 
ness and does not adhere to the finders when touched. The mass may now 
be poured out into a pan or box, slightly dusted with starch, and when cool 
divided into small soiiares. 

Apple Cboutes.— rare, halve and core good smooth apples, cut slices of 
bread; without crust, to fit the fiat side of each half apple ; dust the apple all 
over with sugar, a little nutmeg or cinnamon, arrange these on the slices of 
bread in a pie plate, bake in a moderate oven. The apples will retain their 
shape, and if peeled with care or carved lightly in shells or other fanciful 
designs make a very presentable dish for tea or a hasty lunch, beside being 
simple and healthy. 

Ecokomical Indian Pudding. — Scald one quart of sweet milk, into it stir 
five rounded tablespoons Indian meal, one teacup brown sugar or five table- 
spoons molasses, one teaspoon finger, and a little salt ; put in moderate oven 
to bake, and in half an hour stir in one cup cold rich milk ; bake two hours. 
This is much improved by adding a teacup of raisins when the cold milk is 
added. Serve with cream or hot sauce. 

Soused Bbef left after soup. Cut the meat and bristle off bone in small 
pieces, salt, pepper and spice with mace, and pour over it hot vinegar, or an 
equal quantity of water and strong vinegar will be better. Good for supper; 
may be warmed over for breakfast. 

An Economical Dish. — Season mashed potatoes with salt, pepper, butter 
and cream ; place a layer in a pie dish ; upon this place a layer of cold 
meat or fish, finely chopped, then alternate until dish is full; then strew 
bread crumbs over top and bake brown. 

To Regulate Time in Cookery. — Mutton — A leg of eight pounds will re- 
quire two hours and a half; a chine or saddle of ten or eleven pounds, two 
hours and and a half; a shoulder of seven pounds, one hour and a half; a 
loin of seven pounds, one hour and three-quarters ; a neck and breast, about 
the same time as a loin. 

Be^—The sirloin of fifteen pounds, from three hours and three-quarters to 
four hours ; ribs of beef, from fifteen to twenty pounds, will take three hours 
to three hours and a half. 

FeoZ— A fillet, from twelve to sixteen pounds, will take from four to five 
hours, at a good fire; a loin, upon the average, will take three hours; a 
shoulder, from three hours to three hours and a half; a neck, two hours; a 
breast, from an hour and a half to two liours. 

Lamb — Hind-quarter of eight pounds will take from an hour and three- 
quarters to two hours; fore-quarter of ten pounds, ab(mt two hours; leg of 
five pounds, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half ; shoulder or 
breast, with a quick fire, an hour. 

Pork — A leg of eight pounds will .require about three hours; griskin, an 
hour and a half; a spare-rib of eight or nine pounds will take from two hours 
and a half to three hours to roast it thoroughly; a bald spare-rib of eight 

Eoun<.ls,"an hour and a quarter; a loin of five pounds, if very fat, from two 
ours to two hours and a half ; a sucking pig, of three weeks old, about an 
hour and a half. 

Poitltn/ — A very large turkey will require about three hours; one of ten 
pounds, two hours ; a small one an hour and a half. 

A full-grown fowl, an hour and a half; a moderate sized one, an hour and 
a quarter. 

A pullet, from half an hour to forty minutes- 

A goose full-grown, two hours. 

A duck, full size, from an hour and a quarter to one hour and three 
quarters. 



410 FRAGMENTS. 

Venison — A bnck hannch which weighs from twenty to twenty-five pounds 
will take about four hours and a half roasting; one from twelve to eighteen 
pounds, will take three liours and a quarter. 

A Lunch Dish. — Chop the lean of cold roast beef or steak very fine, sep- 
arating it first from all the fat; nearly fill a pudding dish with cold boiled or 
baked macaroni ; in the center put choj)ped beef, carefully flavored with 
Bait, pepper, thyme, and, if to your taste, a little liquor jibured off from 
canned tomatoes. Pour sour stock or gravy over beef and macaroni, cover 
with bread crumbs, over which pour two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
and bake half an hour. 

Soykr's Receipt for Cookino Ecios. — Take two or three large onions, slice 
til em very thin, and fry till a nice brown. Have ready three or four hard- 
boiled eggs cut in slices, and a cupful of nice gravy, with a little flour of ar- 
rowroot mixed with it; add the eggs to the onions, then pour in the gravy, 
and stir in all till the gravy has thickened, Serve very hot. If a white in- 
stead of a brown dish is wished for, the onions must be stewed in butter, and 
the sauce made of veal broth mixed with a little milk and flour. Pepper 
and salt to taste. 

Aspic Jelly. — To three pints of clear stock (that made from knuckle of 
veal is good) add two ounces of gelatine that has been softened in cold 
water. Beat up the whites and shells of two eges and one yolk ; add them 
to the struck, and put into a saucepan, with a tablespoon ful of catsup, one of 
vinegar, and a teaspoonful each of savory, thyme, marjoram ana parsley, 
and a smaller quantity of mace, cloves, allspice, white pepper and salt, 
and one wineglass of wine. Set it over a slow fire, stirring till it boils ; 
let it cook slowly for a few minutes, giving it constant attention ; then 
set it aside to settle; strain it through a coarse cloth or a fine sieve, and 
set it away to harden. It should be perfectly clear, and may be cut into 
blocks or dice for. garnish, or cut into thin slices and alternated with 
slices of ham or beef, or it may be melted and poured upon chopped chicken 
in a mold. There are many other ways in which it may be useful and orna- 
mental. It is very nourishing, and generally very acceptable to sick per- 
sons, especially if given to them in small quantities ice-cold. 

To Make Kitchen Vegetables Tender. — When peas, beans, etc., do not 
boil easily, it has usually been imputed to the coldness of the season, or 
the rains. This peculiar notion is erroneous. The difficulty of boiling 
them soft arises from an excess of gypsum imbibed during their growUi. To 
correct this, throw a small quantity of carbonate of soda (common baking 
soda) into the pot along with the vegetables. 

To Keep Cheese Moist. — Many housekeepers complain that their cheese 
becomes dry, and some use a kind of bell-glass to put their cheese in. A 
very simple expedient will keep cheese in the best condition. Take a linen 
cloth, or cheese cloth, dip it in white wine, squeeze out excess of wine, and 
wrap up the cheese in it. By doing this the clieese is not only kept moist, 
but its flavor is improved. 

To Clean Vegetables of Insects. -—Make a strong brine of one pound and 
a half of salt to one gallon of water, into this place the vegetables with the 
stalk ends uppermost, for two or three hours ; this will destroy all the in- 
sects which cluster in the leaves, and they will fail out and sink to the bot- 
tom of the water. 

To Dress Salt Mackerel. — Take mackerel from the salt, aiid lay them in- 
side downward in a pan of cold water for two or three days; change the 
water once or twice, and scrape tlie fish clean without breaking it. When 
fresh enough, wipe one dry and hang it in a cool place ; then fry or broil; or 
lay one in a shallow paii, the inside of the fish down; cover it with hot 
water, and set it over a gentle fire or in an oven for twelve or fifteen 
minutes; then pour oft' the water, tuni the fish, put bits of butter in the 
pan, and over the fish sprinkle pepper, then let it fry for five minutes, then- 
dish it. 



FBAQMENTS. 41 1« 

ScBAFPLE. — ^Tt is composed of the head-meat, trimmings of the hams and 
shoulders, flitch, smaller parts of the chine, the heart part of the liver and 
theskin off the parts intended for lard and sausage. The spleen, kidneys and 
cracklings are used hy some and rejected by others. The feet and ears may 
also be used. The head is split between the jaws, and after the tongue is 
taken out it is split through the middle the other way. Cut off one or two 
inches of the snout and take off the jaw-bone and nasal cavities as far as 
the teeth extend, and cut across at the eye and also at the opening of the ear. 
The meat may then be cleaned out evenly. Put the head meat into the boiler 
after putting in water to cover it, add the rest of the meat in a quarter of an 
hour. The meat must be boiled until it will readily separate from the 
bones; (the skins should be boiled separately as they take a long time to 
boil); then taken from the liquid, the bones removed and the meat chopped 
fine. Strain the liquid to get out the small bones, and add to it enough 
water to make five parts liquid to three of meat. Set the liquid to boiling, 
and as soon as it commences stir in meal and boil fifteen or twenty minutes, 
stirring all the time. Make a moderately thick mush, then put in meat, mix- 
ing thoroughly and season to taste. It takes about as much meal as meat, 
but no bucKwheat nor flour. The Indian meal must be ground fine, of new 
corn, well dried before grinding. The meat must be very finely chopped. 
Put away in tin pans or earthern pots in cold place. Unless kept very 
cold, it will not kee^p many weeks, but its popularity generally keeps it from 
spoiling. It is be fned for the table, and eaten hot, of course. Tiiose who 
are unacquainted with this dish, and many of our readers are, should give 
it a trial. 

Dried Pumpkin. — Take ripe pumpkins, cut into small pieces, stew soft, 
mash and strain through a colander, as if for making pies. Spread this 
pulp on plates, in layers some half an inch thick ; dry it in a stove oven, 
which should be kept at so low a temperature as not to scorch it. In about 
a day it will become dry and crisp. The sheets thus made can be stowed 
away in a dry place, and are always ready for use, cither for pies or stew- 
ing. On going to use, soak portions of the article in a little milk over nieht, 
when it will return to as delicious a pulp as if made of a pumpkin when 
fresh. 

Plain Boiled Indian Pudding. — Scald one and a half pints Indian meal 
with half pint boiling water ; add four tablespoons Graham flour, one pint 
milk (either sweet or sour), two tablespoons molasses, half a teaspoon ginger, 
a little salt and one level teaspoon soda (or a little more if sour milk is used) ; 
two tablespoons chopped suet will make it more li^ht and tender, but may 
be omitted. Put into it a well-greased pudding-boiler (two-quart), leaving 
room to swell, and boil throe or four hours in a kettle of water. Or it 
may be tied in a pudding-cloth, leaving room to swell; or steamed in a 
small tin pail for same length of lime. 

Veal and Ham Pie. — Cut the veal and ham into thin slices, lay a slice 
of ham (about one-third the slice of the veal, season it with the season- 
ing as given above, and roll them up and place them in the dish, add 
water and chopped (not sliced) hard-boiled e^frs, place on the crust and 
bake in a moderate heat, the same as for beefsteak pie. If the ham is very 
salt use less salt and more pepper in tlie seasoning. Parsley is a great 
favorite generally with veal. Those wishing it can add it ; also force meat 
balls. Catsup, eUher mushroom or tomato or a little Worcestershire sauce, 
may also be added. Some are verj' fond of savisape meat added to the 
veal pie ; but all tiiese are mere matters of taste. — Prof. C. H. King. 

Potted Beef. — Put the beef in a kettle, with some little slices of salt 
pork at the bottom; sprinkle with salt and a little Cayenne pepper, pour 
over two tablespoon fu Is of vinegar, and set the kettle over the lire, cover- 
ing it closely. When it has fried a little at the bottom, turn the meat, 
and in ten minutes add a half pint of water. Do not lei the meat boil 
drj% but add a little water occasionally, letting it cook slowly, and keep it 
closely covered. 



412 FRAGMENTS. • 

Beep Omelet. — Three pounds beef chopped fine, three eggs beaten 
together, six crackers rolled fine, one table>spoon salt, one tea-spoon pepper, 
one table-spoon melted butter, sage to taste. Mix well and make like a 
loaf of bread; put a little water and bits of butter into the pan, invert a pan 
over it, baste occasionally, bake an hour and a quarter, and when cold 
slice very thin. 

Chicken or Beep CR0QU15TTES.--Take cold chicken, or roast or boiled 
beef or veal, nilnce very tine, moisten with tlie cold gravy if at hand, or 
moisten well, and add one egg, season with pepper, salt and an onion or sage ; 
make into small cakes, cover with egg and oread-crumbs, and fry in lard 
niid butter. One cup fresh boiled rice may be added before making into 
cakes. 

Apple-Butter Custard Pie. — Beat together four eggs, one tea-cup apple> 
butter, one of sugar, one level table-spoon allspice, add one quart sweet milk 
and pinch of salt; bake in three pies with an under-crust; — and, by the way, 
never omit a pinch of salt in custard and lemon pie ; and, in fact, many kinds 
of fruit pies, such a9 green-apple, cur7ant, gooseberry, and pie-plant, are 
improved by it. 

Sweetze^s Favorites. — ^Three eggs, one tea-spoon sugar, one coffee-cup 
sweet milk, one of warm water, four table-spoons potato veast, flour enough 
to make stiff batter; beat yolks and sugar well, stir in milk, water, and yeast, 
and lastly flour, stir well, and set in warm place to rise ; when light, beat 
whites to a stiff froth, and stir into batter with a pinch of salt; bake like 
batter caJces. These are splendid for breakfast if set the night before. 

PoT.\To Cakes. — ^Mix thoroughly with cold, ma.shed potatoes left from 
dinner, the well-beaten yOlk of an e^^\ make into cakes as you would sau- 
sages, place in skillet with a table-siK)on hot ham or beef-drippings, cover 
tightly, and, in five minutes, when lower side is browned, turn, remove rover, 
fry" until the other side is a nice brown ; serve hot. Make up after dinner 
ready for frying for breakfast. 

Potatoes a la Buchesse are now the most fashionable, and, if a really good 
potato is capable of being improved, perhaps this is the best method. Take 
cold, mashed potatoes, roll out and form into little biscuit-shaped cakes (a 
little flour will be required to form them, but do not mix flour with the 
potato), arrange cakes on a pie-plate, glaze them over with beaten egg, and 
oake to a delicate brown. 

EscA LOPED Turkey. — Moisten bread-crumbs with a little milk, butter a pan 
and put in it a layer of crumbs, then a layer of chopped (not very fine) cold 
turkey seasoned with salt and pepper, then a layer of crumbs, and so on un- 
til pan is full. If any dressing or gravy has been left add it. Make a thick- 
ening of one or two eggs, half a cup of milk, and quarter cup butter and 
bread-crumbs ; season and spread it over the top ; cover with a pan, bake 
half an hour and then let it orown. 

Breakpast Stew. — Cut three-fourths of a pound of cold roast beef into 
small pieces, heat slowly with half a pint cold water, one table-spoon Chili- 
sauce, a tea-spoon salt, and half a tea-spoon pepper. Rub two table-spoons 
flour with some butter and a little of the not gravy, add to the beef, let 
cook until the flour is done, and then serve with bits of drj- toast. Slices 
of onions may be first cooked and the meat added to them, with or without 
Chili-sauce. 

Bonny Clabber. — ^This dish is in perfection in the summer, when milk 
sours and thickens very quickly. It should be very cold when served. A 
nice way is to pour the 'milk befose it has thickened into a glass dish, and 
when thick set on ice for an hour or two, and it is ready to serve, and is 
really a very pretty addition to the supper table. Serve in sauce dishes or 
deep dessert plates, sprinkle with sugar (maple is nice), and a little grated 
nutmeg if liked. 

Corn Meal Waffles. — ^To the beaten yolks of three eggs, add one (^uart 
of sour milk or butter-milk, corn meal to make a batter a little thicker 



FRAGMENTS. 413 

than for pan-cakes, one tea-spoon salt, one of soda dissolved in a little warm 
water, then the well-beaten whites; dour may be used instead of corn meal. 
This is also a good rule for pan-cakes, making the batter thinner. For dress- 
ing for waffles, put on the stove a half cup cream, a table-spoon butter, 
and two of su^r; when hot, put two table-spoons on each waffle when 
placed in the dish to serve. 

Egglrss Squash or Pumpkin Pik. — St«w the squash or pumpkin till very- 
dry, and press through a colander; to each pint of this allow one table- 
spoon butter, beat in while warm one cup brown sugar or molasses; a lit- 
tle salt, one table-spoon cinnamon, one tea-spoon ginger, and one half tea- 
spoon soda; a little allspice may be added, but it darkens the pies; roll a 
few crackers very fine, and add a handful to the batter, or thicken with two 
tabtesi>oons flour or one of corn starch. As the thickening property of 
pumpkin varies, some judgment must be used in adding milk. 

SouAPPLK. — Scrape and clean well a pig' s-head as directed in "Pig's-head 
Cheese," put on to boil in plenty of water, and cook four or five hours — 
until the nones will slip easily from the meat; take out, remove bones, and 
chop the meat fine, skim oif the grease from liquor in pot, and return the 
chopped meat to it; season highly with salt and pepper, and a little pow- 
derea sage if liked, and add corn meal till of the consistency of soft mush ; 
cook slowly one hour or more, pour in pans, and set in a cool place. This 
is nice sliced and fried for breakfast in winter, and will answer in place of 
meat on many occasions. 

Fricasseed' AND Fried Potatoes. — Slice cold boiled potatoes, put into a 
dripping-pan, add milk, salt, pepi^cr, and small lump of butter, allowing 
half a i>int of milk to a dozen potatoes, place in oven for about fifteen min- 
utes, stir occasionally with a knife to keep from burning; they should 
brown slightly on the top; or put in sauce-pan lump of butter, when melted 
add a level taole-spoon flour, cook a few minutes and add a tea-cup new milk 
or cream, season with salt and pepper ; when it boils, add sliced potatoes, and 
boil till potatoes are thoroughly neated. To fry, slice and fry in butter or 
ham or beef-drippings, using only enough fat to prevent sticking; sprinkle 
with salt, cover with tin lid so that they may both fry and steam. 

Welsh Rare-bit. — Cut thin slices of bread, remove the crust, and toast 
quickly ; butter it, and cover with thin slices of rather new rich cheese, 
spread over a very little made mustard, and place on a pie-tin or plate in a 
hot oven till the cheese is melted, when cut in square pieces of any size 
•desired, and serve at once on a hot platter, as it is quite spoiled if allowed to 

Set cold. The mustard ma^ be omitted if desired ; and some think it more 
elicate to dip the toast quickly, after buttering, into a shallow pan of boil- 
ing water; have some che^ ready melted in a cup, and pour some over each 
slice. The best way to ser^ is to nave little plates made hot, place a slice on 
each plate, and serve one to each person. 

Yankee Dried Beef.— Slice very thin, put in frying-pan with water to 
cover, let come to boiling point, pour off, and add pint of milk, lump of 
butter, and a thickening of a little flour and milk, stir well, and, just before 
serving, some add an egg, stirring it in quickly; or, chip very fine, freshen, 
add a lump of butter and six or eight eggs, stir well, and serve at onoe. 
Cold boiled or baked beef may be sliced and cooked in the same way. Or, 
after the freshening, first frizzle it in butter, dredge with flour, and add the 
milk. When ends or thin pieces of dried beef become too dry and hard, 
put in cold water and boil slowly six or eight hours, and slice when cold ; or, 
soak over night in cold water, and boil three or four hours. Many think all 
dried beef is improved by this method. 

Curd or Cottage Cheese.— Set a gallon or more of clabbered milk on 
the stove hearth or in the oven after cooking a meal, leaving the door open; 
turn it around frequently, and cut the curd m squares with a knife, stirring 
gently now and then tillabout as warm as the finger will bear, and the whey 
Bhows all around the curd ; pour all into a coarse oag, and hang to drain In

a cool place for three or four hours, or over night if made in the evening. 
When wanted, turn from the bag, chop rather coarse with a knife, and dreas 
with salt, pepper, and sweet cream. Some mash and rub thoroughly with 
the cream; otners dress with sugar, cream, and a little nut-meg, omitting 
the salt and ()epper. Another wav is to cliop fine, add salt to taste, work 
in a very little cream or* butter, and mold into round balls. 

Potatoes a la Lyonnaise are much simpler than the name implies. Rub a 
lump of good butter over the inside of a clean, smooth, slightlv warmed 
skillet, turn in some cold boiled potatoes cut up, add pepper, salt, a little 
chopped parsley, and perhaps the least bit of onion very tine. Shake from 
time to time and see that they do not brown. *' Fried wliite " is the accepted 
slang in fashionable hotels for this very elegant mystification in the art of 
potato cooking. If, for your stomach's sake, you should prefer to have your 
potatoes actually fried a savory crisp brown, drop in smoking hot lard or nice 
drippings (never in butter, as it scorches too quickly; warm up or gauti — fry 
in a well-greased frying-pan — in butter, but fry, or rather boil, in lard or 
drippings). 

Stuffed Beefsteak is as nice for dinner as a much more expensive 
roast, and it can be prepared from a rather poor flunk or round steak ; pound 
well, season with salt and pepper, then spread with a nice dressing — may use 
some of the bread-crumbs — roll up and tie closely with twine (which always 
save from the grocer's parcels), put in a kettle with a quart boiling water, 
boil slowly one hour, take out and place in dripping-pan, adding water in 
which it was boiled, basting frequently until a nice brown, and niaking ^avy 
of the drippings; or you may put it at once into the dripping-pan, omit the 
boiling process, skewer a couple slices salt pork on top, add a very little water, 
baste frequently, and, if it bakes too rapidly, cover with a dripping-pan. It 
is delicious sliced down cold. 

How to make Nice Gravy is a problem many housekeei)ers never solve. 
Remember that grease is not gravy, neither is raw flour. Almost any kind 
of meat-liquor or soup-stock, from which all fat has been removed, may be 
made into nice gravy, by simply adding a little seasoning and some thicken- 
ing; if browned flour is used for the latter, the gravy will require but little 
cooking, but when thickened with raw flour, it must cook until thoroughly 
done, or the gravy will ttiste like so much gummy paste. It is best to brown 
a quart of flour at a time. Put in a skillet, set in the oven or on top of the 
stove, stir often until it is a light-brown, put into a wide-mouthea bottle, 
cork and keep for use. All gravies should be well stirred over a rather hot 
fire, as they must be quickly made, and must boil, not simmer. 

Potato Flour is an addition to many kinds of breads, cakes, and pud- 
dings, making them more light and tender. Wiuii, peel, and grate into an 
earthen pan, filled with pure, soft cold water; when the water begins to 
clear by the settling of the pulp to the bottom, pour off the water aud add 
more, stir pulp w^ith hand, rub through a hair sieve, pour on more water, 
let stand until clear, pour off and renew again, repeating several times until 
the farina is j)erfectly white and the water clear. Tlie air darkens it, and it 
must be kept in the Water as much as possible during the process. Spread 
the prepared farina before the fire, covering with paper to keep it from dust; 
when dry, pulverize it, sift, bottle, and cork tightly. Potato jelly may be 
made by' pouring IndUng water on the flour, and it will soon change into a 
jelly ; flavor and sweeten to taste. 

Stews, if properly prepared, are very palatable. If made from fresh meat, 
they should be immersed in boiling water at first, and then placed where it 
will simmer slowly until done; season, add thickening, and flavor with an 
onion, or a tea-sp>on of curry powder; or prepare a pcxir beefsteak by first 
trimming oft' all the fat and' cutting in convenient pieces, fry in butter or 
drippings to a nice brown on both sides, tnen add a little sliced onion, car- 
rots, or turnips, seasoning, a tea-spoon Chili-sauce, and one pint soup stock, 
or water ; stew gently two or three hours, skim off any grease, and stir in a 



FBAGMEyrS. 415 

little flonr mixed with milk. To make a stew of cold meat, first make the 
gprtLTy of stock, add a fried sliced onion, pepper and salt, and a tea-spoon 
catsup, let it boil, and set aside to cool; when nearly cold, put in thmly- 
cut slices of cold meat, and a few slices cold potatoes, ana let heat grad- 
uailv until it comes to the boiling point ; serve with bread cut in dice and 
Criea. 

Meat Pib. — Put a layer of cold roast beef or other bits of meat, chopped 
very fine, in bottom of dish, and season with pepper and salt, then a layer 
of powdered crackers, with bits 6f butter and a little milk, and thus place 
alternate layers until dish is full ; wet weir with gravy or broth, or a little 
warm water ; spread over all a thick layer of crackers which have been sea- 
soned with salt and mixed with milk and a beaten egg or two; stick bits of 
butter thickly over it, cover with a tin pan, and bake half to three-quarters 
of an hour; remove cover ten minutes before serving, and brown. Make 
moister if of veal. Or, another way of making the pie is to cover any bits or 
bones, rejected in chopping, with nearly a* pint of cold water, and let them 
simmer for an hour or more ; strain and aad a chopped onion, three table- 
spoons Chili-sauce, a level table-spoon of salt, and the chopped meat; let 
simmer a few minutes, thicken with a table-spoon of flour mixed in water, 
let boil once, take off and let cool ; put a layer of this in a pudding-dish, 
then a layer of sliced hard-boiled eggs and a few slices from cold boiled pota- 
toes^ then the rest of the meat, then eggs, etc. ; cover with pie-crust or a 
l^king-powder crust, make an opening in the center, and bake forty min- 
utes. 

To Stuff a Ham, wash and scrape the skin till very white, cut out a piece 
from thick part ^use for frying), leaving the skin on trie ham as far as possible, 
as it makes a casing for the stuffing ; put in a boiler and steam for three hours ; 
take out and score m thin slices all around the skin ; fill the space cut out with 
a stuffing made of bread-crumbs, same as for poultry, only not <^uite so rich, 
seasoned rather highly with pepper and sage ; wrap around a strip of cotton 
cloth to keep in place, and bsuce m the stove one and a half hours, turning so 
as to brown all sides nicely. The last half hour sift lightly with powdered 
sugar and cinnamon. (Some peel off the skin after steaming, stuff and roast 
as Defore.) What remains after once serving is delicious sliced down cold. 
The first we ever ate was at a thanksgiving dinner, cooked in a Southern 
kitchen, by an old-fashioned fire-place, in an iron bake-oven, and the savory 
flavor lingers still in our memory. Nicely cured boiled ham is a never-fail- 
ing source of supply, from which quite a variety of dishes may be prepared. 

Grated Ham is one of the nicest relishes for supper or lunch, or for sand- 
wiches. Cut a good-sized piece from the thickest portion of a boiled ham, 
trim off the fat, grate the lean part, and put in the center of a platter; slice 
some tiny slips of the fat and place around the edge, together with some ten- 
der hearts of lettuce-heads, and serve for supper or lunch. 

To economize the scraps left from boiled ham, chop fine, add some of the 
fat also chopped, and put in a baking-plate, first a la/er of bread-crumbs, 
then a layer of mixed fat and lean, then another layer of crumbs, and so on 
till all is used, putting a few bits of fat over the top; pour over it a little 
water, or a dressing of some kind, and set in oven till a nice brown. This is 
delicious for breakfast, or for a "picked up dinner," after having made a 
soup from the bone, well cracked and simmered for three hours with a few 
sliced potatoes and rice, or dried com and beans which have first been soaked 
and parboiled. In boiling hams, always select an old ham ; for broiling, one 
recently cured. After boiling and skinning a ham, sprinkle well with sugar 
and brown in oven. 

The Care of Fat and Drippings is as necessary in any family as the 
care of last year's garden seeds or the " Family Record." Especially when 
much meat is used, there is a constant accumulation of trimmings of fat, 
drippings from meats, etc., which should be tried out once in two or three 
days in summer— in winter once a week will do. The fat which rises after 



416 FRAGMENTS. 

boiling beef, pork, and poultn', is used for shortening or frying. Cut up in 
small pieces, put in skillet, cover, try out slowly, stir occasionally, and skim 
well ; add the cakes of fat saved from the top of meat liquor, slice a raw 
potato and cook in it to clarity it (some add a pinch of soda), strain all the 
olear part into a tin can or stone jar, or pour over drippings a quart of boil- 
ing water and strain through muslin or a fine sieve, let cool, take out the 
cake which forms on the top, scrape the refuse from the bottom, pour again 
into a skillet and heat until all the water is out, then pour into a jar, and 
you will find it very nice to use either alone or with butter and lard' in fry- 
ing potatoes, doughauts, etc. The leaf fat of mutton should always be tried 
out by it»elf, and used for chapped hands and such purposes. The fat 
which is not nice enough for any of the above uses, should be tried out and 
placed in a jar, kettle, or soft wood cask of strong lye, to which all soap 
grea.^e should be consigned. Remember that the fat from boiling ham or 
from boiling meats with vegetables is never fit for cooking purposes, but 
should be thrown into the soap grease. After skinning and trimming the 
boiled ham, the fat which remains may be tried out and used for drippings, 
and is as sweet as butter. Observe never to use for this soap grease lean 
meat or raw fat Keep a stick with which to stir occasionally, and it will 
need but little boiling to make the best of soft soap. 

Mother has many other valuable ideas on how to stop the nnmberlesB 
little "leaks/' which keep many a family in want, while a little care and 
economy in these minor details would insure a fair competency ; but she 
thinks it better to have the ideas she has already given thoroughly digested 
before clogging them with others. She says a neat clean home, a tidy table, 
and well cooked palatable meals, are safeguards against the evils of the ale- 
house, tlie liquor saloon, and the gambling- table. So that we may, with our 
frying-pans and soup-kettles, wage a mighty war against intemperance, for 
seldom is a well-fed man a drunkard ; and thus our attempts at palatable and 
economical cooking may "kill two birds with one stone." 

By the way, she has just taken up a paper from which she reads tliis item 
by Prot Blot : '* Wasting is carried on so far and so extensively in American 
kitchens that it will soon be one of the common sciences." " Just as I told 
you," says mother, as she folds her hands complacently together, looks down 
at the bright figures of the carpet, and repeats In her slow-measured way: 
'* After all, whether we save or spend, the life is more than meat, and the 
body more than raimeut"

COMPARATIVE VALUE OF FUEL. 



421 



A cord of wood is 128 cubic feet ; the sticks are cut four feet long and piled 
four feet high, and in a pile eight feet long. Wood cut to stove length, 
eighteen to twenty inches, is sometimes sold as a cord, when only eight feet 
long, four feet high, and as wide as the sticks are long, but it is not, of course, 
really a cord. The fair way to sell fuel, however, would be by weight; aiid 
"when weights are equal the wood containing the most hydrogen will pro- 
duce the most heat. Thus, one hundred pounds of dry pine are worth more 
as fuel than the same number of pounds of dry oak. Wood can never bo 
economically used in a green state, as it then contains about twenty-five per 
cent water, which must be evaporated, and all the heat required to evaporate 
this sap is wasted. We give below a table, in which shell-bark hickory is 
made the standard of comparison, rated at 100 in value and 1000 in weight, 
and the weights of other varieties show their comparative value, which may 
be readily estimated in dollars and cents. For instance, if hickory is worth 
$7.00 per cord, the proper value of white-oak would be $4.86, for as lOOJhick* 
ory) is to $6.00, so is .81 to the value of white-oak, $4.86.

The quantity of combustible matter in fuel, if weight and other conditions 
are equal, is indicated by the amount of ashes or non-combustible matter 
remaining. The heating power of fuel is dependent partly on this, but not 
wholly. Fuel is valuable for various purposes in proportion to the flame it 
produces. A blaze is of great service when heat is to be applied to a great 
surface; but where an even or lasting heat is required, a more solid fuel 
is to be preferred. 

The various qualities of bituminous, or soft, and anthracite coals, as sold in 
different markets, makes it impossible to give any accurate comparison of 
values. Measured by pounds, if anthracite is made the standard at 250, sea- 
soned oak ranks 125, or one-half in value; hickory, 137; white pine. 137; 
yellow pine, 145, coke, 285; while the bituminous coals vary from 188 to 248» 



HOUSEKEEPING. 



Housekeeping, whatever may be the opinion of the butt€rflie8 of the period, 
is an accomplishment in comparison to which, in its bearing on woman's rela- 
tion to real life and to the family, all others are trivial. It comprehends 
all that goes to make up a well-ordered home, where the sweetest relations 
of life rest on firm foundations, and the purest sentiments thrive. It is an 
accomplishment that may be acquired by study and experiment, but the 
young and inexperienced housekeeper generally reaches success only through 
great tribulation. It ought to be absorbed in girlhood, by easy lessons taken 
between algebra, music and painting. If girls were taught to take as much 
genuine pride in dustingalx>om well, hanging a curtain gracefully, or broiling 
a steak to a nicety, as they feel when they have mastered one of Mozart's or 
Beethoven's grand symphonies, there would be fewer complaining husbands 
and unhappy wives. The great lesson to learn is that work well-done is 
robbed of its curse. The woman who is satisfied only with the highest per- 
fection in her work, drops the drudge and becomes the artist. There is no 
dignity in slighted work ; but to the artist, no matter how humble his calling, 
belongs the honor which is inseparable from all man's struggles after per- 
fection. No mother, who has the happiness of her daughter at heart, will 
neglect to teach her first the duties of the household; and no daughter who 
aspires to be queen at home and in her circle of friends, can afford to remain 
ignorant of the smallest details that contribute to the cojifort, the peace and 
the attractiveness of home. There is no luck in housekeeping, however it 
may seem. Every thing works by exact rule, and even with thorough knowl- 
edge, eternal vigilance is the price of success. There must be a place for 
every thing and every thing in its place, a time for every thing and every thing 
in its time, and " patience, .patience," must be written in glowing capitals all 
over the walls. The reward is sure. Your husband may admire your grace 
and ea.se in society, your wit, your school-day accomplishments of music and 
pointing, but all in perfection will not atone for an ill-ordered kitchen, sour 
bread, muddy coffee, tough meats, unpalatable vegetables, indigestible pastry, 
and tlie whole train of horrors that result from bad housekeeping; on the 
other hand, success wins gratitude and attachment in the home circle, and 
adds luster to the most brilliant intellectual accomplishments. 

One of the first ideas the young housekeeper should divest herself of is, that 
because she is able, or e.xpecte some time to be able, to keep servants, it is 
therefore unnecessary to understand household duties, and to bear their 
responsibility. *' Girls" are quick to see and note the ignorance or the inca- 
pacity of the mistress of the house, and few are slow to take whatever ad*

HOUSEKEEPING. ^2?> 

vantage it brings them, but the capacity of a mistress at once establishes 
discipline. The model house should not be large, nor too fine and preten- 
tious for daily use. The mistress of many a fine mansion is tiie veriest 
household drudge. A great house, with its necessary retinue of servants, is 
not in keeping with the simplicity of a republic where trained servants are 
not known, and is seldom pleasant for the family or attractive to friends. 
Furniture should be selected for comfort rather than show. Most modem 
chairs put their occupants to torture, and tlirow Uiem into attitudes any thing 
but graceful. Comfortable chairs should have broad seats, and a part at least, 
low seats for women and children. Nothing is more out of taste and ** shoddy" 
tlian to crowd rooms with furniture, no matter how ricli or elegant it may 
be. Nor is it by any mesns necessary to have things in suites; varietj' is pref- 
erable, and each room, especially, should have an individuality of its own. 
Just now the "EasUake " style is in high favor, and perhaps there is danger 
of too strong a reaction from the •* modern styles," most of which, however, 
are a hap-hazard collection of styles, w^ithout any unity of idea in them. 
The " Eastlake " is, in the main, a protest against the falsehoods and shams 
of modern fine furniture, and so far it is a real reform. In a table, for exam- 
ple, we usually have a foundation of pine, put together mostly with glue ; 
this is covered with a veneer of mahogany, walnut, or other wood, and orna- 
mented with carvings, which may mean something or nothing, and which 
are glued to the work. In a few years the pine framework warps and shrinks 
out of shape, the veneer peels, the carving gets chipped, and the whole be- 
comes *' shabby genteel." Eastlake and his followers would have the table 
honest, and be throughout what it appears to be on the surface, hence the 
table is made solid ; and if a costly wood can be afforded — well ; if not, take 
a cheaper wood, but let the table be just what it pretends to be; if braces or 
bars are needed for strength, let them show, and indicate why they are used ; 
and if ornament is desirable, let it be worked in the material, and not glued 
on. A table of this kind will l^xst, and may serve for several generations. 
Finding that our ancestors of a few centuries ago understood the matter of 
furniture better than the cabinet-makers of the present, Eastlake and the 
others reproduced many of the styles of bygone times, and with some dealers 
''Eastlake " is used for antique. But the matter does not depend so much 
upon antiquity of style, as solidity, honesty, and appropriateness. Sets are 
made of plain woods, such as ash and walnut, inlaid with procelain tiles, and 
ornamented with old-fashioned bra.<ts rings and handle*. They are valued at 
from thirty to two hundred and fifty dollars. Bedroom sets of French and 
English walnut, with inlaid w^oods, gilt and bronze ornaments, and varie- 
gated marbles, are sold from thirty-five to fifteen hundred dollars. Parlor 
sets of rich, carved woods, and satin, damask, aishmere, brocade, and tapestry 
coverings, etc., range in price from one hundred to twelve hundred dollars. 
Ebony cabinets inlaid witli ivory and richly ornamented, are worth from 
two to eighteen hundred dollars. Marquetry tables, work tables, library 
tables, Oriental chairs, lounges, easels, music racks, etc., of rich material 
and design, are valued at from ten to one hundred and fifty dollars. Tho 



424 HOUSEKEEPINQ. 

pVincipal woods used are walnuts oC various kinds, ash, bird's-eye maple, 
satin wood and kingwoo<l. Kingwood is almost crimson in color. Book- 
cases are of all prices from twenty to fourteen hundred dollars, and side- 
boards fruiii seventy-live to one thousand dollars. It is a good rule in select- 
ing furniture, not to buy any thing not actually needed, to buy the best of 
its kind, and to pay cash or not buy. Never get any thing because some one 
else has it, and do nut be afraid to wait for bargains. Wise young house- 
keepers buy furniture in single pieces or small lots, as they have means, 
rather than expend more than they can afford in entire sets, which are really 
less attractive. 

Carpets should, as a rule, be of small patterns. The stoves — ^If grates or 
fire-places are not used — should be of the kind that may be thrown open or 
closed at pleasure. If a furnace is used, great care must be taken that the 
rooms are not kept too hot in winter, and that there is most thorough venti- 
lation, as the health of the family depends as much on the quality of the air 
they breathe as the food they eat. To waste heat is not so bad as to waste 
health and rigor, and fuel is always cheaper, on the score of economy, than 
doctors' bills. In furnace-heated houses — ^and the furnace seems to be accepted 
as the best heater, though apparatus for steam and hot water seems likely to 
be so perfected as to supplant it by furnishing a milder and more agreeable 
heat, entirely free from noxious gases — there should always be grates or fire- 
places in living or sleeping rooms; and whenever the furnace heat is turned 
on, there should be a little fire, at least enough to start the column of air in 
the chimney and secure ventilation. It is a common mistake to buy too 
small a furnace or other heating apparatus. This ought to be ample for the 
coldest weather, so that ordinarily it need not be kept up to its full capacity. 
When a furnace is heated too hot, the little particles of dust afloat in the air 
are charred, and the air has a burnt flavor, as unwholesome as it is disagree- 
able. Without fire, chimneys are apt to draw down a current of cold air. 
If there are no grates or fire-places, do not rely on airing rooms from the 
halls, but throw open the windows and take in the outside air. This is 
especially necessary when a room is used as a study, or for an invalid. The 
air from the halls, although cold, is not pure. House-plants will not thrive 
in furnace-heated houses where gas is burned, and human beings, especially 
the young and delicate, need quite as pure air as plants. In a study, or 
other room much occupied, the windows may be dropped during meals, and 
the room warmed anew before it is needed again. There must also be plenty 
of sunlight, floods of it in every room, even if the carpets do fade; and the 
housekeeper must he quick to note any scent of decay from vegetables or 
meats in the cellar, or from slops or refuse carelessly thrown about the prem- 
ises. Many a case of fatal diphtheria or typhoid fever may be traced directly 
to the noxious vapors arising from decaying matter in a cellar, the outside of 
which is fair to look upon, while the parlors and living rooms are kept with 
perfect neatness. Such houses are whited sepulchers, and the inmates are 
doomed to pay the penalty of ignorance or carelessness. Every room must be 
clean and sweet. In sickness, care in all these respects must be doubled. In

damp and chill aatumn and spring days, a little fire is comfortable morning 
and evening. The food for the family must be fresh to be wholesome, and it 
is economy to buy the best as there is less waste in it. No housekeeper ought 
to be satisfied with any but the very best cooking, without which the most 
wholesome food is unpalatable and distressing; and no considerations of 
economy should ever induce her to place on the table bread with the slightest 
aour tinge, cake or pudding in the least heavy or solid, or meat with the 
slightest taint Their use means disease and costly doctor's bills, to say noth- 
ing of her own loss of repute as an accomplished housekeeper. If children 
and servants do work improperly, she should quietly insist on its being done 
correctly, and in self-defense they will soon do it correctly without supervis- 
ion. Order and system mean the stopping of waste, the practice of economy 
and additional means to expend for the table and for the luxuries and ele- 
gancies of life — things for which money is well expended. It requires good 
food to make good muscle and good brain, and the man or woman who 
habitually sits down to badly cooked or scanty dinners, fights the battle of 
life at a great disadvantage. 

8WEBPU?0 AND DUSTING. 

The sweeping and dusting of a room seems simple enough, but is best 
done systematically. ** Dusters," made of old prints, with which to cover 
books, statuettes, and such articles as are difficult to dust, and larger ones 
to cover beds, are indispensable in sweeping and dusting. " Carpet sweepers" 
are only fit for daily use, when thorough work is not required, a thorough 
sweeping once or twice a week sufficing even the tidiest of housekeepers. 
Before sweeping open the blinds and let in the light, and open the windows 
if it is not storming or too windy. Look on the ceiling for cobwebs, and 
sprinkle the carpet over with moistened brun, salt, damp coffee-grounds, or 
tea-leaves. Clean the corners and edges with a sharp-pointed stick and stiff 
whisk-broom. Brush down with the feather-duster all picture-cords, frames, 
and curtains, and remove all cob-webs with a broom about which a towel has 
been pinned, going through all rooms before removing the towel ; then clear 
one corner of furniture and begin sweeping toward the center with a short, 
light stroke, going slowly and carefully so as to raise no dust, and drawing, 
not pushing, the broom. The second time over, increase the length and force 
ol the stroke, and the third, brush with long and vigotevS strokes, using 
care as the dirt at the center of the room is approached. In this way it will 
take twenty minutes to sweep a large room, but it will be clean^ and the car- 
pet will wear, bright and fresh, much longer than if the dirt were allowed to 
grind out the fabric. After the sweeping remove the ''dusters'* carefull;% 
carrying them out of doora to shake, and rub, not simply wipe, off the 
furniture and other articles with a clean, soft, cotton cloth or an old silk 
handkerchief, or, better, a soft dusting-towel witli fleecy surface which is sold 
expressly for this purpose, folding the dust in as it soils the cloth, and when 
it IS filled with dust, shako thoroughly out of doors. Managed in this way, 
curtains, furniture and cajT)eta will never be loaded with dust, but will re* 
main bright, clean and fresh irom one year's house-cleaumg to another's. IC 



426 SO USEKEEPISG, 

any spot of dust is too firmly fixed, wash in luke-warm soap-suds, and izxi' 
mediately rub dry with chamois-skin. If there is open-work carving, draw 
the cloth through, or dust with a paint-brush; and it will be found more con- 
venient to blow out some of the places which are difficult to reach, for which 
purjx>se a small pair of bellows may be used. To clean and dust a piano, 
use half a yard best conton-flaunel with a nap free from all specks and grit, 
brushing lightly over to remove the dust; if there are finger-marks or spot8» 
rub up and down over them, always keeping the nap next to the instrument. 
i >ust under the wires may be blown out with a pair of bellows. Keep the 
]iiano closed at night and in damp weather ; open on bright days, and if pos- 
sible let the sun siiine directly upon the keys, as the light will keep them, 
from turning yellow. Tune every spring and fall. As a last finishing touch 
to the rearranging of the parlor, leave late papers, magazines, a volume of 
poetry, or a stereoaoope and views, where they will be readily picked up bj 
callers. 

THE 8ITTINO-ROOM. 

The sitting-room should be the pleasantest, because most used, of all in tiie 
house. Do not put down a Brussels carpet here, because it is too hard to 
sweep and holds too much dust. To prevent moths under the carpets, grind 
black pepper coarsely, mix with camphor-gum, and strew thickly about the 
edges and wherever they are to be found. To clean the oil-cloth, use warm 
water without soap, or, what is much better, milk and water. By keeping 
mats at the doors it will only be necessary to sweep the sitting-room thoi^ 
oughly once a week, but occasionally, when very dusty, it may be cleaned by 
setting a pail of cold water by the door, wet the broom in it, knock ofiT the 
drops, sweep a yard or so, then wash the broom as before, and sweep again^ 
being careful to shake all the drops off the broom, and not to sweep far at a 
time. If done with care the carpet will be very nicely cleaned, and the 
quantity of dirt in the water will be surprising. The water must be changed 
several times. Snow sprinkled on and swept off before it has had time to 
melt (be careful to have rooms cool), is also nice for renovating a soiled carpet 
A scrap bag hung on the end of the sewing-machine, for storing all bits of 
cloth and ravelings, and ends of thread, will save much sweeping. In sum* 
mer, wire doors and mosquito-nettings in the windows will keep flies out, and 
at the same time admit the air. Washing windows and wiping off doors once a 
week after sweeping, keeps all tidy. To remove finger-marks, which are con- 
.stantly appearing on doors about the nobs, use a damp cloth as soon as they 
are observed. 

THE BED-ROOM. 

The family bed-room should be on the first floor if possible, if the house 
is properly built and there is no dampness. Matting is better for the floor 
than carpet, because freer from dust, and this is the room used in case of 
sickness. If made properly it will wear for several years. Canton mattings 
are made on boats in pieces about two yards long, and afterward joined on 
shore into pieces of fifty yards. It is easy to see where these short piecea 
jure joined ; after cutting into lengths, first sew these places across and across 



HOXJSEKEEPINQ. 427 

on the wrong side, then sew the breadths together and tack down like a 
carpet. Matting should never be washed with any thing except moderately- 
swarmed salt and water, in the proportion of a pint of salt to a half pail of 
aoft water. Dry quickly with a soft cloth. A bed-room matting should be 
^washed twice during the season; a room much used, oftcner. In this room 
there should be a medicine closet, high above the reach of children, where 
axe kept camphor, hot drops, mustard, strips of old linen, etc^-for sudden 
sickness or accident. There should also be a large closet, a part of which is 
especially set apart for children's use, with low hooks where they may hang 
their clothes, a box for stockings, a bag for shoes, and other conveniences, 
which will help to teach them system and order. The bedding should be 
the best that can be afforded. The inner husks of corn make a good under- 
l)ed. Oat straw is also excellent. Hair mattresses are best and, in the end, 
most economical. Mattresses of Spanish moss are cheaper than hair, but 
£Oon mat down. Those made of coarse wool . are objectionable at first on 
account of the odor, but are serviceable and less costly than hair. When 
the woven-wire bed is used, a light mattress is all that is needed ; and this 
<K)mbination makes the healthiest and best bed, because it affords the most 
complete exposure of tlie bedding to air. The best covering is soft woolen 
blankets. Comforters made of cotton should be used with great caution, as 
they need to be frequently exposed to sun and air. The best comforter is 
made of delaines, which may be partly worn, with wool Instead of cotton 
quilted in. Beds are almost always made up too early. The thrifty house- 
keeper likes to have rooms put to rights in the morning, but it brings up the 
old adage of " the white glove " which " hides a dirty hand." The bed should 
lie open for several hours every morning, and at least once a week all the 
bedding should be thoroughly aired. Air pillows in wind, but not in sun. 

THE GUEST-GHAMBEB. 

The bed of the guest-chamber, as well as in all sleeping-rooms, should 
stand so that when one opens the eyes in the morning the light from the 
window will not be directly upon them, as it is trying to weak eyes, and 
unpleasant to strong ones. Keep the bureau where the sun's rays will never 
strike the mirror, and where it will not be heated by the stove, as either will 
granulate the amalgam. Chambers should always be provided with tran- 
soms over the doors, and windows arranged so as to lower easily from the 
top. A light feather-bed, covered with a case like a pillow, may be either 
used over the mattress, or a comfort may be used over it, and the feather- 
beds under it. Tacked on the inside of the washstand-doors, two crotcheted 
pockets are nice for bathing sponges, and there should be plenty of towels, 
•especially of those coarse, rough ones which make a morning bath such a 
luxury. A broad oil-cloth in front of the washstand is also a protection to 
the carpet in bathing, and is needed when there is no bath-room up stairs.

keeper has a feeling of sympatliy, ancT begins to talk of house-cleaning. The 
first bright sunshine of spring reveals unsuspected dust and cobwebs, and u> 
her imagination even the scrubbing-brunlies and brooms seem anxious to 
))egin the campaign. In northern latitudes it is best, however, not to begin 
too soon. Do not trust entirely to appearances, for spring is almost certain 
to break her promises of pleasant weather, and give us a good many da]r» 
when it will be any thing but pleasant to sit shivering in a fireless room, 
while the children become unmanageable and husband growls. So for the 
Kake of health, peace, and comfort^ do uot remove the stoves before the mid- 
dle of May. 

Devote a week, at least, to preparations. See that all needed repairs are 
made about the house, and have all necessary tools on hand and in good 
order. Provide lime for whitewashing, carpet-tacks, good soap, sawdust, 
carbolic acid, copperas, and spirits of ammonia. Have closets, bureau draw- 
ers, etc., all thoroughly renovated. Reorganize sewing table, arrange bags 
for the odds and ends that have accumulated during the winter, having 
different ones for each article, and marking the outside in some way ; for 
instance, for the button-bag, sew one on the outside, and so on. Put 
pieces of ribbon, velvet, lace, flowers, etc., in a box, and have it in readiness 
for the spring ** fixing up." While this renovating is being done, have *Hfae 
boys" cleaning the yard of the winter rubbish and debris, as this is far more 
important in a sanitary point of view than inside house-cleaning. When you 
begin, do not upset all the house at once, driving your husband to distrac- 
-uon, and the children to the neighbors. By cleaning one or two rooms at a 
time, and using a little womanly tact, the whole house may be renovated 
with little inconvenience. • 

If you are a *' lone woman" you will need the help of one stout girl at the 
least, unless you are stouter than the average American woman, or your 
house is very small. Hire her at least the week before, so that she can get 
accustomed to the house and your way of doing work. Be sure you wash and 
iron every thing you can find that is soiled. Then, on Saturday, do an extra 
large baking, so you will have sufficient bread, cakes, etc., to do you the most 
of the next week. (Make Sunday truly a day 9f real.) Then, on Monday, be 
up early ; after breakfast leave the girl to wa.sh the dishes, sweep, and put 
things in order up stairs, and you take a man and go to the cellar ; first have 
every thing taken out of the cellar that«does not actually belong there. The 
reai$on for cleaning the ceWsiT first is, that it is generally left to the last when 
uli are tired and nearly worn out, and is apt to get what is called a " lick and 
a promise." The cellar should be one of the most particular places about the 
house; therefore, do it first while fresh and strong. After all the surplus 
things are taken out, move the rest to one end, then give the end a good 
sweeping overhead, down the sides and under foot Every particle of vege- 
table remnants should be removed, and the spot which may have been moist- 
ened by their presence thoroughly swept, and, if necessary, it should be 
scrubbed or sprinkled over with copperas water to sweeten it and to prevent 
malarial exhalations. Boxes, barrels, etc., should be removed into fresh 



HOUSEKEEPING. 429 

localities in the cellar, so that the places which have gathered dampness 
beneath them may become dry. All the gatherings of earth from stored 
vegetables, and all the bits nnd shreds of things that grow, must be cleared 
away, or they will become dangerous enemies when exhalations that always 
pse from such things upon heated days sliall find their way up into sleeping 
apartments to jwison the family with malarial gases. (The cellar should 
always be aired as early as possible after the intense cold is gone, and all 
summer long too much fresh air can not reach its dim recesses.) 

Now wash the windows, and then whitewash every nook and corner witli 
common whitewash made yellow with copperas. Don't be saving, and nil 
vermin will bid yot/r cellar a long "good-bye." Now move the things back 
to that end and treat the other end the same way ; when all is done, dust or 
wasli out all boxes, barrels, etc., and return to their places, which should be 
arranged as handily as possible. Carry out all trash, wash down the steps, 
and you are ready to leave the door and windows open and go to the garret 
Open the windows, gather up all papers and place in a box ; next, if rags are 
lying around, pick them up and sort them, putting in sacks (paper sacks are 
best for woolen ; if not torn, will keep out moths), tie each sack with a strip 
like the rags it contains, clean up all other trash and take down to bum, if 
of no other account. Now sweep good overhead, hang up sacks and other 
articles, sweep floor, moving all boxes, trunks, and bundles, then wash floor 
up lightly, just to remove the dust If you have seen any signs of moths 
they must be attended'to, as they will be in the cracks of the floor; it is no 
use to try to get rid of them down stairs while the garret is kept for a breed- 
ing house. Benzine is sure death to moths, but do not use it if there is fire 
In the house near, /or it is very dangerous. If no fire, sprinkle the floor freely 
with it. The odor will soon escape at the open windows. Or take common 
lamp-oil and wash the floor all over; it "smells loud," but will all be gone 
in about two days and so will the moths. Now wash down the steps (other 
wood-work and windows should have been washed before the floor was), and 
you are done. The time taken will be in accordance with the size of the 
rooms and number of things to handle. Now for the bed-rooms. If there is 
a hall, move all the furniture out in it from the rooms, and put the bed out 
to sun. (Never clean house except in sunny weather: if cloudy in the morn- 
ing, try to put it off till clear weather. ) 

Take down all pictures, ornaments, etc. ; clean them and put them away 
in the closets. Clothes, carpeting, and "trumpery" stowed away, must h' 
thoroughly dusted and aired in sunshine and wind. Take up carf)et, fold it 
up by lifting one side, carrying it over to the other, and laying it down care- 
fully, thus preventing straw and dust getting on the upper side. Carry it 
out and lay it on the grass or hang it on a clothes-line and beat it on the 
wrong side with canes — taking care that the canes have no sharp points. 
Then spread, the carpet out and sweep well on the ripht side. There is more 
art in sweeping a carpet than a novice is apt to suppose. An old broom 
should never be used, and a new one should be kept especially for the car- 
pets. With Brussels and velvet carpeting there are two ways to the pile, just 



430 ^0 USE-CLEAmNG. 



in velvet, and they shonld always be fiwept with the pile. If a carpet \m 
swept against the grain, it soon looks rough and scratched up. Wash out all 
grease spots with a little gall soap and clean water, after the dust is entirely 
beaten out. Take one or two pails of sawdust, wet thoroughly and scatter 
well over the floor ; a very little dust will arise when you sweep it off, and it 
w^ill not be necessary to clean the floor before washing wood- work and win-* 
dows. If you can not get sawdUst, use moist earth instead. 

Wash and polish the windows, and if the walls are hard-finish, they may 
be washed off lightly with soap-suds, and wiped dry. Wash wood- work and 
doors with hot soap-suds, and rinse with strong, hot brine, or hot water with 
a strong mixture of cayenne pepper in it, to drive out mice, rats, and other 
vermin. Now take some clean old calico and put around a new broom and 
rub down every part of the paper; if it gets dirty, get a clean one, and wash 
that ready for the next room. If well rubbed, will make the paper look 
clean and bright. If new paper is needed or whitewash overhead, it is better 
to hire a man who makes that his daily work. The great secret of good floor- 
washing is never to do the whole room with the same water; change it two 
or three times in a small room, and more frequently in a large room. After 
washing, wipe with a flannel, wringing it frequently. In washing wood- 
work, do not slop water enough about to run a mill, for it can be done just 
as well without making any slop. Do not use soap if the paint is good ; with 
rain-water, a soft rag, and a brush if there are any fancy moldings, give it 
time to aoakj and you will And all dirt comes off, leaving the paint looking 
like new. Glass should be washed, wiped nearly dry, and finished with tissue 
paper. (Always save tissue paper for that purpose.) In washing the floor, 
do not forget the closets. If moths are in them, use benzine on the floor; 
also sprinkle the room floor with benzine, remembering that there must be 
no fire. When floor is dry, blow cayenne pepper into every crack and 
crevice, using a small pair of bellows for the purpose. 

Now we are ready to go to the next room the same way. Then return to 
number one and put the carpet down. A carpet wears better if put down 
well, and it is better to have it done by experienced persons when the expense 
can be afforded and such help can be had. Moth-proof carpet lining is best, 
but several thicknesses of newspaper come next as a carpet preserver. The 
printer's ink is an excellent moth preventive, and the newspapers keep the 
carpet from rubbing on the boards. The good old-fashioned way of putting 
under good clean rye or oat straw is again in favor, for the reason that dust, 
so destructive to them, will pass through both carpet and straw to the floor. 
Begin at one corner, and nail down one of the sides at the cut ends of the 
bread tlis, continuing round the selvage side, and stretching it evenly and 
firmly without straining the fabric. When two sides are nailed, take next 
the other selvage side. The last side will require the most stretching in order 
to get rid of puckers. 

For stair carpets, make a pad of coarse cotton clotli, nearly as wide as the 
carpet, and the full length of the stairs; fill with two or three layers of 
cotton-batting, sewed across to stay it about nine inches between seams. Thia 



HO USE'CLEANINQ. ^^ j 

Is best because not displaced so easily as paper. Have half a yard mora 
<»rpeting than is needed in order to turn the carpet upside down, and 
change the positions of the places where the edge of the steps make a 
mark. When the carpet is new, leave it uncovered, and put down stair 
cloth after it begins to show wear. Linen over-carpet in the summer is 
both cool and pleasant; besides, it helps to keep away moths. After being 
swept and laid down on the tioor, the carpet should be wiped. Have two 
pails, one of clean soaj^suds, the other with lukewarm water, a clean flannel 
doth, and two clean, coarse towels. Take the carpet by breadths, wring ili-; 
flannel out of the lukewarm water and hold it so that you can turn and ii>o 
it up and down three or four times on the same place. Rub both with and 
against the grain as hard as if you were scrubbing the floor, then throw 
the tianuel into soap-suds, and rub the carpet dry with one of the dry 
towels. If you leave the carpet wet, the dust will stick to it and it will 
smell sour and musty. Wash the riannel clean in the 8oai>-sud8, wring it 
out of the warm water and proceed as before. If the carpet is very dirty 
or has much green in it, use fresh ox-gall in the lukewarm water in the 
proportion of a qtiart of gall to three quarts of water, and rub the carpet 
dry as already directed. This rubbing a carpet raises the pile and freshens 
the colors. When the carpet is nicely down and swept the room is ready 
for Its customary furniture, unless the more thorough renovation of kalso* 
mining and painting is to follow the cleaning. Before replacing, every 
article sfliould be thoroughly cleaned, every button and tuft of the uphol- 
stered goods receiving its share of attention from the furniture-brush. 
Sofas and chairs should be turned down and whipped then carefully 
brushed, and all dust wiped off with a clean cloth slightly damped. Clean 
the pictures and hang them back. If photo or. engraving, and dust under 
the glass, take them out and rub off with a clean cloth. Clean the glass by 
washing in weak annnonia water and wiping dry. If gilt frames, wash with 
a little flour of sulphur and rain-water; if rosewood or other dark wood 
and varnished, rub with furniture polish made as follo'.v.s: Alcohol, eight 
ounces, linseed oil (raw) eight ounces, balsiim fir, one-half ounce, acetio 
ether, one-half ounce. Dissolve the fir in the alcohol, then add the others 
and apply with a flannel cloth, and rub until dry. If oiled (not var- 
nished), rub with a cloth wrung out of lamp (kerosene) oil and they will 
look like new. Go over all the furniture with the above polish or oil, accord- 
ing as they are oiled or varnished. If ever troubled with bed bugs, go over 
every part good with lamp-oil. Clean all the other rooms the same way, 
leaving the hall until the last. Wash the oil-cloth with water in which 
some borax is dissolved, and wipe with a cloth wrung out of sweet milk. 
Follow the above directions for the rooms down stairs; do not have more 
than two rooms torn up at once. Clean out all moths as you go, for they 
will soon ruin carpets, chairs, sofas, etc., if not killed. Polish the furniture 
as above, and do not raise any dust where it is for a few days. Ink stains can 
be taken out with oxalic acid. Wash in cold water, then in a solution of 
chloride of lime, than in water again: if white goods, warm them up in

salted milk, let them lie some time, and then wash in water. In cleaniiig 
paint, use water in which ammonia has been added, till it feels slippery, or 
use fine whiting— to be had at the paint or drug-stores. Take a dannel 
dipped in warm water, squeezed nearly dry ; dip this in the whiting, and 
rub the paint with it; then wash off with warm water. For windows, use 
either of the above, or Indexical soap. For the natural wood, or grained 
work, use clear water and wipe off quickly, or cold tea. 

Paint can be taken off where not wanted, with turpentine. Apply with 
a sponge, after a little time it will rub otf ; if cloth, rub between the hands 
and it will crumble off. White spots can be taken off varnished furniture 
by rubbing with, a rag wet with spirits of camphor. 

It should be remembered that ammonia, especially the stronger kinds, is 
dangerous, a few drops being enough to injure a person. When used for 
cleansing purposes is should be handled with great care, that the gas 
which is given off freely in a warm room, be not breathed in large quan- 
tites, and do injury to the delicate lining of the nose and mouth. Benzine 
is a liquid, in the handling of which much caution should be exercised. It 
is very volatile, and its vapor, as well as the liquid itself, inflammable. When 
employed for removing grease, or other stains, from clothing, gloves, etc., 
it should never be used at night, nor at any other time near the fire. 
Alcohol must also be used with great care, especially at night 

When the kitchen is cleaned, all the bake-pans, sauce-pans, tin-kettles, etc., 
should be plunged into a boiler filled with strong soda water; or, add to clear 
hot water some of the following fluid, which you have already prepared, as 
follows : One pound of sal-soda, one-half pound stone lime, five quarts soft 
water ; boil a short time in copper or brass kettle, stirring occasionally ; let 
settle, then pour off the clear fluid into a stone jug, and cork for use. After 
this, they are really purified, oven if they are not scoured with sand, sapolio, 
or whatever burnishing material happens to be a favorite with the housewife. 
This process of cleaning the pots and pans is often performed by the tidy 
housewife, but it is especially appropriate at the time when the whole house 
is being purified of its half year's accumulation of soiling. A kitchen 
should have a painted wall that can be washed with a scrub-brush and 
water, or it should be whitewashed with lime. To clean the kitchen, kettle- 
closets and pantry, is usually the greatest dread of the spring campaign, but 
it need not be if the formalities of boiling the tins is going on while the walls 
and shelves are l>eing scrubbed. Papers should be cut and fitted to the clean 
fclielves. Try to have wire screens at all outside doors and all windows, and 
the one leading from the kitclien to tlie dining room, also the lower half of 
all windows. Keep plenty of husk mats and foot-scrapers at the doors, and 
learn to stop and use them. Have a i>lace for every thing and always put it 
there ; it will save work. Do not work so hard as to make youself sick ; 
better be a little dirty than have a spell of sickness. A kitchen and pantry 
need cleaning several times in a year, being used the most and should be 
kept the cleanest. 

Sinks, drains, and all places that become sour or impure, should bl 



HOUSE-CLEANINO. 433 

cleansed with carbolic acid and water. This, or some other good disinfectant, 
%hould be kept in every house, and used frequently in warm weather. An- 
other 'good disinfectant is copperas; ten cents* wortli, dissolved in water, will 
deodorize your sink and other bad smelling places about the buildings. 
Probably there is nothing better for the purpose than copperas ; it possesses 
no bad odor. Do not place carbolic powder boxes, nor sprinkle chloride of 
lime, etc., where your drain openings exist, merely to distract your nose*s 
attention from the sewer gas, which is issuing from some leaking pipe or 
choked trap; by so doing you but ignore nature's warning, that like the 
premonitory smoke and rumblings of a volcano, advises you of the eruption 
of the disease to come. While house-cleaning, brighten up old furniture by / 

mbbing well with kerosene oil; should it be marred or bruised, use the / 

" Magic Furniture Polish " page 446. Take bedsteads to pieces, and saturate ' 

every crevice with strong brine; nothing is better to purify and cleanse, or 
to destroy bed-bugs. To clean mirrors, take clean warm rain-water, and 
put in just enough spirits of ammonia to make it feel slippery. If very 
dirty, rinse, if not, wipe dry and you will be surprised at the effect. Do 
not polish stoves until fall if you are going to put them away during the 
summer, but to keep them or any iron utensils from rusting, rub over 
with kerosene. When polishing, six or eight drops of turpentine added to 
blacking for one stove, brightens it and makes it easier to polish. To re* 
move mortar and paint from windows, rub spots of mortar with hot, 
sharp vinegar; or, if nearly fresh, cold vinegar will loosen them. Rub the 
paint spots with camphene and sand. To remove spots from gray marble 
hearths rub with linseed oil. 

Fall house-cleaning deserves no less attention, except that white- washing 
and painting can best be done in the mild days of spring, when the house 
may be thrown open to wind and sunshine. The best time is in the 
constant weather of October ; and before beginning, all the dirty and heavy 
work for the winter, such ea getting in coal and wood, should be com- 
pleted, and the cellar made clean and sweet. 

PROTECTION AGAINST MOTHS. 

During the week before the "siege" of house-cleaning in spring or fall, 
look over all garments and articles to be put away, mend, remove all grease 
spots if possible. An effective mode for cleansing is to a table-spoon ammonia 
add a tea-cup boiling water; when cool enough saturate a piece of the goods 
or a sjwnge with it and rub the spot briskly, rinse with a clean cloth and 
fresh water, rubbing as before. Shape the garment with the hands so that 
the wet part will neither be stretched or shrunken; dry in the air or by a 
sunny window. If not out repeat process being careful to rub the goods with 
the nap, then beat with a limber cane and place on the line in the wind and 
sun for a day. Towards evening, before dampness finds its way into them, 
fold them up with pulverized camphor, cut tobacco or cedar chips, lay in 
their wrinkles, wrap them in newspaper, carefully tie and label them, and 
they are ready for the closet .shelves. Or, have fixed a trunk, box, or chest 
that is thoroughly cleaned, and lay an old sheet, that has, however, no holes 
28 



/ 



434 HOUSE-CLEANINQ. 

In it, in this receptacle, so that the middle of the sheet is parallel with the 
bottom of the box. Lay the heaviest garment at the bottom with a plentiful 
supply of gam camphor, in bits the size of a hickory-nut, or cedar shavings, 
strewn upon each garment; when the box is filled strew camphor or cedar 
shavings on top of the last garment, and all around the edges, and fold and 
pin the sheet over so that all of the edges lap over each other. Close the 
box, and set in closet in some part of the house which is frequented often 
during the warm weather, for the presence of any animated object is certain 
to disturb the moth. Alwaj's clear out all closets and trunks early in the 
spring. Wash with a sponge dipped in a mixture of ammonia and alcohoL 
Every thing the closets or trunks contain should be shaken and well aired. 

Sometimes a heavj' carpet, in a room seldom used, is not taken up at house- 
cleaning time. In this case lay a cloth along the edge of the carpet and pass 
slowly over it with a hot flat-iron. This will kill moths and their eggs. If 
moths are discovered in a carpet at a time when it is inconvenient to take it 
up, they may be killed in the same way. A carpet, particularly if turned 
under at edges, should not be left down longer than one year, even if not 
much used. 

All moths work in the dark, hence clothing, furs or carpets exposed to the 
light arc not in so much danger as when put away in the dark. The worms 
are torpid and do not work during the cold of the winter. Early in the 
spring they change into chrysalids, and again in about three weeks they 
transform into winged moths, when they fly about the house during the 
evening until May or June. Then they lay their eggs, always in dark places, 
and immediately after die. The eggs, which are too small to be detected with 
the naked eye, hatch out in about two weeks, and the young worms immedi- 
ately proceed to work. 

Furs should not be worn late in the season. They should be combed care- 
fully with a dressing-comb, beaten and aired (but not in the hot sun), sprink- 
led with camphor gum, and wrapped in linen, sewed up, and then put in a 
paper bag. Newspaper is not strong enough; brown wrapping paper is 
better. Paper boxes may be used, but should be pasted securely so nothing 
can enter. Cedar chests will effectually keep out moths, but few are so fort- 
unate as to possess these. Any article of fur, which has previously been 
troubled with moths, should be opened and examined in July, to make sure 
no moth is harbored in them, despite the precautions taken. This process, 
pursued resolutely year after year, will keep a house almost, if not entirely 
free, from the moth, and save much destruction and annoyance. 

In the country remote from drug-stores, many housekeepers use the dried 
leaves of sage, thyme, spearmint and other highly scented herbs. These are 
gatlicred after the housewife has laid in aM she may require for cooking and 
medicinal purposes, are tied in bunches and dried, and then laid among the 
clothes in the large wooden chest ; or a pole is laid from rafter to rafter, and 
the clothing is hung over this, and casings of calico or old cotton quilts are 
carefully pinned around each garment, the bunches of herbs being also 
pinned at intervals about the clothing.

PAPEEINQ. 435 

KALSOMINING. 

If papering and painting, or kalsominlng are to be done, do the last named 
first. Wash ceiling that has been smoked by the kerosene lamp, with a strong 
solution of soda. Fill all cracks in tiie wall with a cement made of one pai't 
water to one part silicate of potash mixed with common whiting. Put it in 
with, a limber case-knife if you have no trowel. In an hour, after it has set, 
scrape off the rough places, and after kalsomining no trace of the crack will 
appear. For the wash, take eight pounds whiting and one-fourth pound white 
glue; cover glue with cold water over night, and heat gradually in the morn- 
ing until dissolved. Mix whiting with hot water, add the dissolved glue and 
stir together, adding warm water until about the consistency of thick cream. 
Use a kalsomine brush, which is finer than a white-wash brush, and leaves the 
work smoother. Brush in, and finish as you go along. If skim-milk is 
naed instead of water, the glue may be omitted. 

PAINTING. 

If painting has been required, a patient endurance of a sufficient number 
of drying days must be given over to this process. The smell of the turpen- 
tine will be very much diminished, and the unwholesomenessof paint almost 
destroyed, by placing in the apartments, and in the adjoining sleeping-rooms, 
several wash-bowls or pails filled with cold water. In the morning the top 
of the water will exhibit the material which it has absorbed, and which those 
who were breathing the same air would have taken into their systems. If but 
one coat of paint is to be placed upon an apartment, all the wood should be 
carefully washed with strong sal-soda water, and dried before painting it, to re- 
move any oily or dingy spots that would otherwise soon show through a 
eingle layer of either white or color. 

Any woman of a mechanical turn of mind can paint a room, buying the 
l^int ready mixed. While painting keep the room well ventilated and eat 
acid fruits. When done, any spatters on the glass may be removed by the 
application of a mixture of equal parts of ammonia and turpentine, washed 
off with soap-suds. To polish the glass, wash in warm water, wipe with a soft 
cloth, put a Utile whiting on the center of the pane, and rub with chamois* 
4kin or a soft cloth. 

PAPERING. 

In papering a hard-finished wall, a thin solution of white glue should be 
first applied with a white-wash brush. To make the paste, sift the fiour, add 
one ounce pulverized alym to every pound of flour, mix it smoothly with 
cold water, and pour over it gently but quickly boiling water, stirring mean- 
time constantly. When it swells and turns yellow it is done, but is not to be 
used until cool, and may be kept for some time without spoiling. Or, for 
paste, clear corn starch is sometimes used, made precisely as made for starch- 
ing clothes. It is well to use a small quantity of carbolic acid in it, as a pre- 
caution against vermin. A thin paste of wheat, or what is better, rye fiour, 
is, however, very good for any thing except the most delicate papers. The 
wall should be smooth, and if very smoky or greasy in spots, it should be 
washed with weak lye or soap-suds. Trim the paper close to the pattern on 



436 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

one 8ide. A pair of long shears is best for the purpose— allowing the roll to 
lie on the floor, and rolling up again on the lap as fast as trimmed. Provide 
a board wider than the paper, and a little longer than a single breadth when 
cut. Cut all the full breadths that will be required for the room, matching 
as you cut, and saving remnants for door and window spaces. Begin at 
the right hand and work to the left. The breadths may be laid one on 
another on the board, the top one pasted with a good brush, the top 
turned down, bringing the two pasted sides together, a foot or two from 
the other end. Carefully adjust the top to its place, gently pressing it 
with soft towels, first down the middle of the breadth and then to each edge. 
In turning a corner, paste only that part which belongs to one side, fasten 
it in place, and then paste and adjust the rest. The border may be tacked 
on ; No. 4 tacks will not be visible at the top of a room, and it may be re- 
moved when the ceiling needs whitening. In selecting paper avoid contrasts 
in colors and large staring patterns, as they are out of taste and tiresome 
to the eye. Choose rather neutral tints and colors that harmonize and blend 
agreeably together, and with the general tone of carpets and furniture. 
Even with a bare floor and plain wooden chairs, the effect of a soft-tinted 
paper gives a vastly different impression than if the wall is disfigured 
with glaring figures and contrasting colors. If ceilings are low, heighten the 
appearance by a figure which runs perpendicularly through the wall-paper; 
the effect produced is very deceptive — the ceiling appearing much higher 
than it really is. Wall-paper is half a yard wide, and about eight yards to 
the roll, so that it is easy to estimate the quantity needed. It is wise al- 
ways to get one extra roll for repairs. After papering a room build no fire 
in it until dry. 

GENERAL BUGQESTIONS. 

On Monday, wash: Tuesday, iron: Wednesday, bake and scrub kitchen 
and pantry : Thursday, clean the silver- ware, examine the pots and kettles, 
and look after store-room and cellar : Friday, devote to general sweeping 
and dusting : Saturday, bake and scrub kitchen and pantry floors, and pre- 
pare for Sunday. When the clothes are folded off the frame after ironing, 
examine each piece to see that none are laid away that need a button or a 
stitch. Clean all the silver on the last Friday of each month, and go 
through each room and closet to see if things are kept in order and nothing 
going to waste. Have the sitting-room tidied up every night before retir- 
ing. Make the most of your brain and your ey^, and let no one dare tell 
you that you are devoting yourself to a low sphere of action. Keep cool 
and self-possessed. Work done quietly about the house seems easier. A 
slamming of oven doors, and the rattle and clatter of dishes, tire and be- 
wilder every body about the house. Those who accomplish much in house- 
keeping— and the same is true of every other walk in life— are the quiet 
workers. 



Silver-ware, when set away, keeps best wrapped in blue tissue-paper. 
Raiky Days. — Make tlie house as bright ana sunshiny as possible. 



GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 437 

To Preve2»t Hinges Creakino. — Rub with a feather dipped in oil. 

To Drive ofp Fleas.— Sprinkle about bed a few drops of oil of lavender. 

Red Ants. — A small bag of sulphur kept in a drawer or cupboard will 
^rive away red ants. 

Icy Windows. — Windows may be kept free from ice and polished by 
nibbing the glass with a si>onge dipped m alcohol. 

To Destroy Cockroaches, etc.-— Sprinkle the floor with hellebore at 
night. They eat it and are ^^oisoned. 

Lost CniLnREN. — Label children's hats with the name and place of resi- 
dence so that, i* lost, they may be easily restored. 

Parcels. — When parcels are brought to the house, fold paper and put 
away in drawer, and roll the string on a ball kept for the purpose. 

Soap.— It is a great saving to have bars of soap dry. It should be bought 
by the quantity. 

'To Prevent Pails prom Shrinking. — Saturate pails and tubs with gly- 
cerine, and they will not shrink. 

To Keep Flies ofp Gilt Frames. — Boil three or four onions in a pint of 
water and apply with a soft brush. 

To Remove Old Putty from Window-Frames. — Pass a red-hot poker alowly 
over it, and it will come off easily. • 

To Soften Hard Water. — ^Hard water l>ecomes nearly soft by boiling. A. 
piece of chalk will soften hard spring-water. 

Provide on Saturday for Monday, so as not to take up the fire with 
cooking, or time in running errands on washing-day. 

To &)FTEN Cistern-Water. — Cistern-water that has become hard froiki. 
long standing, can be softened by adding a little borax. 

To Destroy the Smell op Fresh Paint. — Sprinkle hay with water in which 
chloride of lime has been mixed, and place on floor. 

Ants and Insects. — Dissolve two pounds alum in three quarts water. Ap- 
plv with a brush while hot to everjr crevice where vermin harbor. 

1*0 Clean Chromos. — Dampen a linen rag slightly and go over them gently. 
If the varnish has become defaced, cover with a thin mastic varnish. 

Coal Ashes make excellent garden walks. They become very hard by use 
and no weeds or grass will grow through them. 

To Cleanse a Sponge.— By rubbing a fresh lemon thoroughly into a 
fionred sponge and rinsing it several times in lukewarm water, it will become 
AS sweet as when new. 

To Remove Grease Spots prom Carpets. — Cover spots with flour and 
then pin a thick paper over ; repeat the process several times, each time 
(irushmg off the old flour into a aust-pan and putting on fresh. 

Mending. — Never put away clean clothes without examining every piece 
to see if they are in any way out of order. Stockings, particularly, should 
be carefully darned. 

HardWhitewash. — Ten cents worth of kalsomine, five cents worth of 
glue dissolved in warm water, two quarts of soft soup, and bluing. This will 
do 'for halls closets, fences, etc. 

Bad Smell.^. — Articles of clothing, or of any other character, which have 
become impregnated with bad-smelling substances, will be freed from ihem 
by burying for a day or two in the ground. Wrap up lightly before burying. 
Cement for China. — To a thick soluticm of gum arable add enough plaster 
of parts to form a sticky paste; apply with a brush, and stick edges to- 
gether. 

Sheets. — ^When sheets arc beginning to wear in the middle, sew the sel- 
yage sides together and rip open the old seam, or tear in two and hem the 
Bides. 

To Make Artificial Coral. — Melt together four parts yellow resin and 
one part vermilion. Dip twigs, cinders, or stones in this, and when dry they 
will look like coral. 
To Sew Carpet-rags on a Machine. — Make the stitch short, run it ob- 



438 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

liqaely across the rags where they are to be joined, and sew a good many 
before cutting the thread. 

A Rustic Frame. — A neat rustic frame for pictures may be made of cat- 
tail rods. Hide the corners where they are joined with ivy, or a vine made 
of leather-leaves or handsome autumn leaves and the berries of bitter-sweet 

To Destroy Weeds in Walks. — Boil ten pounds stone-lime, five gallons 
water and one pound fiour of sulphur, let settle, pour off clear part, and 
sprinkle treely upon the weed^ walks. 

To Mend Tin. --Scrape the tin about the hole free from grease and rust, rub 
on a piece of resin until a powder lies about the hole, over it lay a piece of  
solder, and hold on it a hot poker or soldering iron until it melts. 

To Remove Grease from Wood before Painting. — Whitewash the spots 
over night, and wash it olf in the morning. When dry, the paint will stick. 
Slaked Time laid on the spots and wet a little, will do as well as whitewash. 

To Clean Hearths. — Soapstone or sandistone hearths are cleaned by 
washing in pure water, then sprinkling with powdered marble or soapKstooe, 
and rubbing with a piece of the stone as large as a brick, and having at 
least one tlat surface. 

Lightning Cream for Paint or Plothes. — Four ounces white castile 
soap, four of ammonia, two of ether, two of alcohol, one of glycerine; cut the 
soap fine, dissolve in one quart of soft water over the fire, and when dissolved 
add the other ingredients. 

Kerosene and Carpets. — ^When so unfortunate as to spill kerosene oil or 
other grease on a carpet, sprinkle buckwheat flour (wheat flour will do) 
lightly over it until it is completely covered, and let it lie without disturb- 
ing it for a week ; brush off, and there will be no trace of oil left 

Magic Furniture Polish. — Half pint alcohol, half ounce resin, half 
ounce gum-shellac, a few drops analine brown ; let stand over night and add 
three-fourths pint raw linseed oil and half pint spirits turpentine ; shake well 
before using. Apply with cotton flannel, and rub dry with another cloth. 

To Hang Pictures. — The cheapest and best material with which to 
hang pictures is copper wire, of a size proportioned to the weight of the 

Sicture. When hunz, the wire is scarcely visible, and its strength and 
urability is wonderful. 

Lamp-wicks. — To insure a good light, wicks must be changed often, as 
they soon become clogged, and do not permit the free j^assage of the oiL 
Soaking wicks in vinegar twenty-four hours before placing m lamp insures a 
clear flame. Felt wicks are best. 

To Temper Lamp Chimneys. — Lamp chimneys and glass-ware for hot 
water are made less liable to brake by putting in cold watser, bringing slowly 
to boiling point, boiling for an hour, and allowing to cool before removing 
from water. 

Furniture Polish. — One and a half ounces each alcohol and butter of 
antimony, one-half ounce muriatic acid, eight ounces of linseed-oil, one- 
half pint vinegar. Mix cold. This has been tried for twelve years and has 
been regularly sold for $10. 

A Cheap Carpet. — Make a cover for the floor of the cheapest cotton cloth. 
Tack it down like a carpet, paper it as you would a wail with paper re- 
sembling a carpet in figures, let it dry, varnish with two coats of varnish, and 
with reasonable usage it will last two years. 

Mending Plaster of Paris. — Gum shellac makes an excellent strong 
cement for joining broken pieces together, and is more covenient than glue. 
The shellac should be flowea upon the surfaces to be joined, firmly pressed 
together, and carefully set away for about one hour. 

To Make Rag Rugs. — Cut rags and sew hit and miss, or fancy striped as 
you choose ; use wooden needles, round, smooth, and pointed at one end, of 
any convenient length. The knitting is done back and forth (like old fash- 
ioned suspenders), always take off the first stich. — Anna F. Sisey, 

To Clear Cistern Water. — ^Add two ounces powdered alum and two

^nnces borax to a twenty barrel cistern of rain-water that is blackened or 
oily, and in a few hours the sediment will settle, and the water be clarified 
■and fit for washing and even'for cooking purposes. 

To MAKE Oil-Cloths more Durable. — Before or after putting down new 
oil-cloths, put on one or two coats of linseed-oil with a brush, and when 
thoroughly dry, add one or two coats of varnish. This makes the cloth 
softer and much more duToble. — Miss Eva Evatit^ Delaware. 

To Keep Ice-water. — Make a hat-shaped cover of two thick^nesses of 
43trong brown paper with cotton-batting quilted between, large enough to 
cirop over and completely envelop the pitcher. This prevents the warm air 
from coming in contact with the pitcher, and the ice will last a long time. 

To Sweep a Rag-Carpet. — St?t a pail of water outside the door and dip the 
broom in it, shaking the water otf, so there will be no wet streaks on the car- 
pet ; sweep but a small portion, and then dip the broom again ; in this way 
the dust is taken up in the broom, instead of being sent whirling througn 
the air. 

To Start a Fire in damp, still Weather. — Light a few bits of shavings 
or paper placed upon the top of grate: thus by the heated air's forcing itself 
into the chimney and establishing tnere an upward current, the roOto is 
kept free from the gas and smoke which is so apt to fill it, and the tire can 
then be lighted from below with good success. 

Putting away Clothes. — Before putting away summer or winter clothes, 
mend, clean, brush, shake well, fold smoothly, sprinkle gum-camphor, on 
«very fold, and on the bottom of trunks or closets (unless cedar chests are 
used). Fine dresses, cloaks, etc., should be wrapped in towels or sheets by 
themselves, and placed in the tray or a separate apartment of the trunk. 

Cement for Attaching Metal to Glass. — Mix two ounces of a thick 
■solution of glue with one ounce of linseed-oil varnish, and half an ounce 
of pure spirits of turpentine ; boil the whole together in a close vessel. After 
it has been applied to the glass and metal, clamp together for two or three 
days till dry. 

Cane Chair-Bottoms. — ^To clean and restore the elasticity of cane chair- 
bottoms, turn the chair bottom upward, and with hot water and a sponge 
wash the cane ; work well, so that it is well soaked ; should it be dirty use 
floap, let it dry well in the air, and it will be as tight and firm as new, pro- 
vided none of the canes are broken. 

To Paste Paper on Tin. — Make a thin paste of gum-tragacanth and water, 
to which add a few drops of oil of vitriol. Mix a pound each of transparent 
glue and very strong vinegar, one quart alcohol, a small quantity of alum, 
and dissolve by means of a water-bath. This is useful for uniting horn, 
pearl, shell, and bone. 

To Clean Oil-Cloths.— Take a pail of clean, soft, lukewarm water, a nice, 
soft piece of flannel, wash the oil-cloth and wipe very dry so that no drop of 
water is left to soak in and rot the fabric. After washing and drying, if a 
cloth is rung out of a dish of skim-milk and water, and the oil-cloth is rubbed 
over with this, and then again well dried, the freshness and luster of the 
cloth will well rej)ay the extra labor. 

How to Wash Chamois Leather. — Make a good, tepid suds with hard or* 
soft soap, put in leather, rub it on the wash-board, put soap on skin and rulj 
again on board, and wash in this way through one or two suds, or until per- 
fectly clean; rinse in tepid water without bluing, squeeze dry (do not wring), 
hang in sun and keep snapping and pulling it till perfectly dry. The leather 
will be as soft as new if the snapping and pulling are done thoroughly. 

A Cheap Filter. — The most impure water may be rendered pure* by fil- 
tering through charcoal. Take a large flovver-pot, put a piece of sponge or 
clean moss over the hole in the bottom, fill three-quarters full of equal parts 
clean sand and charcoal, the size of a pea; over this lay a linen or woolen 
cloth large enough to hang over the sides of the pot. Pour the water into 
the cloth, and it will come out pure. 



440 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS, 

To Clean Looking Glasses. — Divide a newspaper in two, fold np one- 
half in a small square, wet in cold water. Rub tiie glass first with tlie wet 
half of the paper, and dry with the other. Fly-specks and all other marks 
will disappear as if by magic. This is only true of the best quality of rag 
paper, sucn as is used by tlie best weekly papers. Paper which has wood or 
straw in it leaves a linty deposit on the glass. 

To Cl^an Silver- ware Easily. — Save water in which potatoes have 
been boiled with a little salt, let it become sour, which it will do in a few 
days; heat and wash the articles with a woolen cloth, rinsing in pure water, 
dry and polish with chamois-leather. Never allow a particle of soap to 
touch silver or plated ware. For wiping silver, an old linen t&ble-cloth cut 
np in pieces of convenient size, hemmed, and marked "silver," is very nicje. 

To Clean Smoke off Marble.— Wet a piece of flannel in strong ammonia 
and rub the marble quickly with it, and then wash off with hot soap-suds ; 
or, make a paste of chloriue of lime and water and brush over the whole 
surface that is smoky. Let it stand a minute, then wash with hot suds. A 
paste of crude potash and whiting brushed over a grease spot on marble will 
cleanse it perfectly. 

Economical Mats for use in front<loors, fire-places^ bureaus, stands, 
etc., may be made of cotfee-sacking, cut to any desired size, and worked in 
bright worsted or Germantown wool. Any simple pattern may be used or 
it may be entirelv filled in with a plain green. The edges of the sacking 
may be fringed oy raveUng. To give it weight, line with an old piece ^ 
carpet or heavy cloth. 

A Good Cement — For mending almost any thin^, may be made by mixing 
litharge and glycerine to the consistency of thick cream or fresn putty. 
This cement is useful for mending stone jars, stopping leaks in seams of tin- 
pans or wash-boilers, cracks and holes in iron kettles, fastening on lamp^tops; 
an all cases the article mended should not be used till the cement has hard- 
<ened. This cement will resist the action of water, hot or cold, acids, and 
•almost any degree of heat. 

To Preserve Books. — Bindings may be preserved from mildew bv brush- 
ing them over with the spirits of wine. A few drops of any perfumed oil will 
secure libraries from the consuming effects of mold and damp. Russia 
leather which is perfumed with the tar of the birch-tree, never molds or sus- 
tains injury from damp. The Romans used oil of cedar to preserve valuable 
manuscripts. Russia-leather covered books, placed in a stationer's window, 
will destroy flies and other insects. 

Badlt Fitting Doors. — When blinds and doors no not close snugly, but 
leave cracks through which drafts enter, the simplest remedy is this: Place a 
strip of putty all along the jambs, cover the edge of the blind or door with 
chalk, and shut it. The putty will then fill all spaces which would remain 
open and be pressed out where it is not needed, while the excess is easily 
removed with a knife. The chalk rubbed on the edges prevents adhesion, 
and the putty is left in place, where it soon dries and leaves a perfectly fit- 
ting jamb. 

Care of Oil Paintings and Frames. — Wash the picture, when neces- 
sary, in sweet milk and warm water, drying carefully. Or, clean the paint- 
ing well with a sponge dipped in warm beer, and when perfectly dry, wash 
with a solution of the finest gum-dragon dissolved in pure water. ' To re- 
touch a gilt frame wet the rubbed spot with isinglass dissolved in weak 
spirits. When about dry. lay on gcjld-leaf, and when quite dry, polish with 
a very hard burnisher. Give the gilt frame when new a ooat of white var- 
nish, and all specks can then be washed off with water or suds without 
harm. 

Finish for Room. — A room with plain white walls is finished beautifully 
by placing a black walnut (or the same wood with which the room is fin- 
ished) molding around the room where the border of paper is usually placed, 
at the junction of wall and ceiling. The molding, finished in oil, costs from 



GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 441 

one to five cents a foot, and is easily put up. The upper edge should be 
rounded, and a space of a quarter inch left between it and ceiling. To hang 
pictures buy an S hook, sofd at all hardware stores, place one hook over the 
molding, hang the picture cord on the other, and slip to the right or left to 
the desired position. This saves the wall from injury from picture-nails. 

Pkbpbtual Pastb. — Dissolve a tea-spoon of alum in a quart of water. 
When cold, stir in as much flour as will give it the consistency of thick 
cream, being particular to beat up all the lumps ; stir in as much powdered 
losin as will lay on a five-cent piece, and throw in half a dozen cloves to give 
it a pleasant odor. Have on the fire a tea- cup of boiling water, pour the 
flour mixture into it, stirring well at the time. In a few minutes it will be 
of the consistency of mush. Pour it into an earthen vessel, let it cool, la^ a 
cover on, and put in a cool place. When needed for use, take out a portion 
and soften it with warm water. Paste made in this way will last a year. It 
is better than gum, as it does not gloss the paper. 

To Clean a Papered Wall. — Cut into eight pieces a large loaf of bread 
two d&ya old, blow dust off wall with a bellows, rub down with a piece of the 
bread, in half yard strokes, beginning at the top of the room, until upper 
part is cleaned, then go round again repeating until all has been gone over. 
Or, better, take about two quarts of wheat bran, tie it in a bundle of coarse 
flannel, and rub i^over the paper. It will clean the paper nicely. If done 
carefully, so that every spot is touched, the paper will look almost like new. 
Dry corn meal may be used instead of bread, applying it with a cloth. If 
^ase spots appear, put blotting paper over spots and press with a hot flat- 
iron. 

Ink Stains on mahogany, rosewood, or black walnut furniture may be 
removed by touching the stain with a feather wet in a spoonful of water in 
which six or eight drops of nitre have been mixed. As soon as the ink dis- 
appears, rub the place immediately with a cloth wet in cold water, or tlie nitre 
will leave a white stain. If the ink stain then remains, make the solution of 
nitre stronger, and repeat. Ink stains on pa})er mav be removed by a solu- 
tion made as follows : Dissolve a half pound chloride of lime in two quarts 
of soft water ; let stand twenty-four hours and strain through a clean cotton 
cloth ; add to an ounce of the lime-watei^a tea-spoon of acetic acid, apply to 
the blot, and the ink will disappear. Dry with blotting paper. Bottle the 
remainder of the lime-water closely, and keep for future use. 

The Cabe of Marble. — Never wash the marble tops of wash-stands, 
bureaus, etc., with soap. Use clean warm water (if very much soiled add a 
little ammonia) and a soft cloth, drying immediately with a soft towel. 
There is nothing that will entirely remove grease spots from marble, hence 
the necessity of avoiding them. To clean marble or marbleized slate man- 
tels, use a soft sponge or chamois-skin, dampened in clean warm water 
without soap, then polish with dry chamois-skin. In dusting, use a feather- 
duster, and never a cloth, as it is likely to scratch the polished surface. 
Slate hearths are preferable to marble, as they are not so easily soiled. To 
wash them, use a clean cloth and warm water. Many oil them thoroughly 
when new with linseed oil ; thus prepared they never show grease spots. 

Indelible Ink. — Two drams lunar caustic, six ounces distilled or rain- 
water ; dissolve, and add two drams gum-water. Wet the linen with the fol- 
lowing preparation : Dissolve one-half an ounce prepared natron, four ounces 
water, add half ounce gum-water, (recii)e below); after smoothing it with a 
warm iron, write with the ink, usjng a gold, quill, or a new steel pen. The 
writing must be exposed to a hot sun for twelve hours; do not wash for one ' 
week, then be particular to get out the stain which the preparation will 
make. If this is followed in every particular, there need never be a failure. 
Oum- water for tlie above is composed of two drams gum-arabic to four 
ounces water. One tea-spoon makes two drams, two taDle-spoons make one 
ounce. If at any time the ink becomes too pale add a little of pure lunar 
caustic. Never write without using the preparation, as it will rot the cloth. 



442 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS, 

To Exterminate BedbuiiS. — In March scald with hoi ling water every crack 
or suspected place where they find refuge, and then touch thoroughly every 
crack and seam where the bugs are likely U) harbor, with kerosene. Great 
care must be taken not to injure fine varnished furniture. If any injury ia 
done to varnish by the hot water, it may be restored by rubbing immedi- 
ately witli a rag wet in turpentine or oil. Beds should be examined again 
for vermin in July and August, and if measures are taken to exterminate 
them, there will be very little trouble. Another death-dealing method is to 
fill crevices with salt, and wash bedstead with .strong brine, or use kerosene 
in the same way. Paris-green and mercurial ointment are deadly poisons to 
the beilbug, but as they are dangerous to have in the house, the first-named 
metlKxls are preferable.* One jjart quicksilver to twenty parts white of an 
egg, applied with a feather to every crack and crevice in bedstead and room, 
will kill them. Most people are unable to console them.selves for sleepless 
nights as did the Irishman, who said : '' Indade, I did auite as well as the 
bugs, for not one of them slept a wink all night," and the above recipes, are 
anv of them certain to remove the pests if pn)perly and faithfully applied. 

Farmer's Door Mat. — Every doorstep should be provided with a foOt- 
scraper and a brush or broom, and every one, as he comes in, should take the 
time to use them before appearing on the carpet or clean Hoor. If a regular 
scraper — one ma<le for the purpose — is not at hand, one can make one from a 
bit of hoop-iron, which is to be placed on a step or edge of the porch in a 
convenient place. It is well to provide a ** mud-mat," which is simply strips 
an inch or so sijuare — fence pickets will answer — screwed to three or four 
cross-pieces an inch apart, or a more elaborate one can be made by stringing 
the .slats upon fence wires. One with muddy boots is very apt to stamp ana 
rub tliem on the strips or floor of the porch f a mud-mat will clean them off 
more effectually, and save the porch hard wear, A very excellent mat may 
be made by boring holes in aboard, and drawing corn husks tlirough the 
lioles. Careful persons change their foot-gear when they enter the house to 
remain any length of time— a custom con<lucive not only to neatness, but so 
greatly to comfort, that it is to be commended. 

Moving. — When about to move to another house, begin packing two weeks 
beforeliand. Carefully inuk small and fragile articles in boxes arid barrels. 
In this way, china and glasswaJ*, and fragile ornaments may be stowed 
away with odd articles of clothing, bedding, etc. Books should be packed 
in boxes, or wrapped several in a package, in several thicknesses of news- 
paper, and tied with strong twine. They can thus be transported with very 
little handling. Larger pictures should be taken down and tied in couples, 
face to face, with rolls of soft paper between the corners to prevent rubbing. 
Small pictures maj' be packed with clothing in bureau-drawers and trunks. 
Take up carpets last. When about ready to move, select one room up-stairs 
into which remove every thing possible from the other rooms, and another 
below for the same purpose. If the occupant of the house into which you 
are to move will do the same, you can easily make some rooms there readv 
for occupancy. Of course each room must be swept down and scrubbed. 
As soon as the floors are dry, carpets may be put down in the more impor- 
tant rooms, and the furniture moved in. On the day the transfer is made, 
see that coal or fuel is provided, so that a fire may be started, and take along 
a basket, with matches, towels, napkins, knives and forks, sugar, tea, bread, 
and other materials for lunching. With all the caution you can exercise, 
you will find Franklin's old saying true, that " three removes are as bad as a 
tire." Houses that have been empty may become fever breeders when they 
•come to be re-occupied. An English sanitary ofl!i(;er alleges that he has 
observed typhoid," diphtheria, or other zymotic affections to arise under these 
circumstances. The cause is supposed to be in the disiL«*e of cisterns, pipes, 
and drains, the process of putrefaction going on in the impure air in them, 
the unobstructed access of this air to the house, while the closure of windows 
and doors effectually shuts out fresh air. Persons moving from the city to 



GENERAL SUQOESTIONS. 443 

their country homes for the summer, should see that the drains and pipes 
are in perfect order, that the cellars and closets are cleared of rubbish, and 
the whole house thoroughly aired before occupying. Copperas used freely 
in the cellar is a good and cheap disinfectant 

Labor-saving Contbivamcbs. — Every good housewife has neatly arranged 
cupboard and dish-closet. Every thing has its appropriate shelf and division. 
But there are other thin^ for which provision should be made. A pile of 
books is sometimes seen in one part of the dining-room, a few newspapers in 
another, and a pair of shoes in a third. The inside of a closet is sometimes 
a mass of confusion — "a place for every thing," and every thing thrown 
promiscuously into it Half a dozen garments are hung upon one nail, to 
crowd each other out of shape ; others are thrown upon the floor amid heaps 
of boots and shoes. And so on to the end of the chapter of careless and slov- 
enly disorder. There is no excuse for such carelessness, and no satisfaction 
in such housekeeping. Want of time is no excuse, for such want of system 
and order is the cause of the most prodigal waste of time. It is only neces- 
sary to use the brain a little to save the hands. Systematic habits, doing 
every thing well, and the hundred little contrivances which will suggest 
themselves to every neat and ingenious housekeeper, will save time, and 
establish order and cleanliness. Have shelves in the closet, and regular rows 
of hooks, and plenty of them; let one side be appropriated to one kind of 
clothing, with a hook for each article. If necessary to preserve the order, 
make a neat label, and paste over each hook. Make shoe-pockets (these 
pockets are made of about two and a half yards of calico ; one yard of which 
makes the back, to be tacked to the door when done. Split tne remaining 
yard and a hali in two, lengthwise, and, placing the strips about one inch 
apart, make, across the back, three rows of pockets, by -stitching first the 
ends of the strips to the sides of the back, and then gather the bottom of each 
strip to fit the back ; then separate each strip into two, three, or four pock- 
ets, according to tlie use for which they are designed, and fasten by stitching 
a narrow " piping '* of calico, from top to bottom of the back, between the 
pockets. All the work may be done on a machine. A border of leather, 
stitched on the edges of the back, and a narrow strif) used instead of the 
calico *' piping," make whole much stronger) on the inside of the doors, and 
never put any thing on the closet floor, where it will be trodden upon in 
entering for other articles. Never stuff any thin^ away out of sight in haste 
and disorder. Hiding dirtiness does not cure it Those who write many 
letters should have a case, with **plgcon-holes" labeled and arranged alphar 
betically — a box for three or four letters is sufficient — in which to keep them, 
with one compartment for unanswered letters. When the case becomes 
crowded, or at the end of the year, wrap in packages, and label with letter 
and the year. Newspapers and magazines, wnen preserved, should be neatly 
filed in order and laid away, or sent away for binding. The work-basket, 
which is in daily use, is often a spectacle for gods and men — ^the very picture 
of confusion and disorder. When it can be afforded, one of the new ladies' 
adjustable work-tables, of which several admirable styles are made and widely 
advertised, will be found a great convenience, especially where there are 
children — whose little fingers delight in tumbling tne contents of the basket 
If a basket is used, it should be divided into compartments. A circular bas- 
ket, with divisions about the edge for smaller articles, and larger spaces in 
the center, is convenient, and easily kept in order. All these, and hundreds 
of other devices like them, are labor-savers, which relieve housekeeping of a 
large share of its burdens. And a calculation of the time spent every year 
in hunting through closets for lost overshoes or slippers, or in cleaning up 
the scattered items in the sitting-room when company is coming in, ana 
searching for missing letters among a miscellaneous pile thrown into a 
drawer, will give a startling result, and convey some {^equate idea of the 
real money and time- value of that love of neatness and order which is one 
of the cardinal virtues in women.

THE DIN^ING-ROOM. 



It may not be amiss to give a page or two to the observances of formal 
dinners in '* society," lest some reader — who may hope, if she becomes the 
rare boasekeeper we expect, to be called to give such dinners as the wife of 
a Congressman, Governor, or even as mistress of the White House itself — 
shonld be taken unawares. In every house, great or small, the Dining 
Room should be as bright, cheerful and cosey as possible, and at the table 
the mistress should wear her brightest smile. If there are trials and troubles, 
do not bring them to the table. They impair digestion, and send husband 
and children out to business or school, glum and gloomy, instead of refreshed 
and strengthened. The plainest room may be made beautiful by taste, and 
the homeliest fare appetizing by neatness and skill. Little attentions to the 
decoration oc pretty arrangement of the table charm the eye and whet the 
appetite, and make the home table powerfully attractive. The every-day 
observance of sensible and simple table manners ought always to be encour- 
aged, because, in the long ri.'n, it promotes the comfort and the cultivation of 
the family, and takes the pain of embarrassment out of state occasions. 
Above all, the room, the table, and its furniture should be scrupulously neat 
and orderly. For formal dinners, a round table, five to seven feet in diam- 
eter, is the best fitted to display the dinner and its fine wares ; but the exten- 
sion table, about four feet wide and of any length desired, is generally used. 
At the round table, conversation is, of course, easily made general, the party 
being small. The table-cloth must be spotless, and an under-oover of white 
cloth or baize gives the linen a heavier and finer appearance. A center-piece 
of flowers is a pretty ornament (some even place upon the table a handsome 
vase filled with growing plants in bloom), but the flowers must be few and 
rare, and of delicate odors. Fruit in variety and tastefully arranged with 
green leaves, and surrounded with choice dessert-dishes, is always attractive 
and elegant. It is also a pretty custom to place a little bouquet by the side 
of each lady's plate, and to fold a bunch of three or four flowers in the 
napkin of each gentleman, to be attached to the left lapel of the coat as soon 
as seats are taken at the table. Napkins, which sliould never be starched, 
are folded and laid upon the plates, with a small piece of bread or a cold 
roll placed on the top, or half concealed by the last ifold. Beside each plate 
are placed as many knives, forks and spoons as will be needed in all the 
courses (unless the lady prefers to have them brought with each new plate, 
which makes more work and confusion), and a glass, to be filled with fresh 
water just before dinner is announced. The plates which will be needed are 
counted out. Such as are to be filled with reculy-prepared dessert-dishes ar« 

(446) 



446 THE DININQ-ROOM, 

filled and set in a convenient place. Dishes that need to be warm, not hot^ 
are left on the top shelf of the range or elsewhere where they will be kept 
warm until needed. When the soup-tureen (with the soup at the boiling 
point) and the soup-plates are placed before the seat of the hostess, dinner 
may be quietly announced. The host or hostess has, of coarse, previously, in^ 
dicated to each gentleman the lady with whose escort he is charged, the 
guest of honor, if a gentleman, escorting the hostess, and taking a seat at 
her right ; if a lady, being escorted by the host to a seat at his right Each 
gentlemap offers the lady assigned to him his right arm, and escorts her to 
a seat at his left, paissing her in front of him to her chair which he has 
gracefully drawn back. The distribution of seats will tax the tact of the 
hostess, as the moment of waiting to be assigned to place Is extremely 
Awkward. Of course, all should have been decided on beforehand, and the 
places should be designated with as little confusion as possible. The suc- 
cess of the dinner will depend largely \x\yo\x the grouping of ag^reeable per- 
Bons. The host leads the way to the dining-room, the hostess follows last, and 
all guests stand until she is seated. (In France, and at large dinner parties 
in this country, a card with the name of each guest is placed on the plate 
which is intended for him.) Once seated the rest is simple routine. Ease 
of manner of the host and hostess, and quiet and systematic movements in 
attendants, who should be well trained, alert and noiseless, but never in a 
hurry, are indispensable. Any betrayal of anxiety or embarrassment on the 
part of the former, or blundering by the latter, is a wet blanket to all enjoy- 
ment. 

The attendant places each dish in succession before the host or hostess 
(the soup, salad and dessert only being served by the hostess) with the pile 
of plates. ESach plate is supplied, taken by the attendant on a small salver, 
and set before the guest from the left. Any second dish which belongs to 
the course is presented at the left of the guest, who helps himself. As a rule 
the lady at the right of the host, or the oldest lady, should be served first 
As soon as any one has finished, his plate is promptly removed, and when 
all are done, the next course is served in the same way. Before the dessert 
is brought on, all crumbs should be brushed from the cloth. The finger- 
bowls, which are brought in on the napkin on the dessert-plate and set off 
to the left of the plate, are used by dipping the fingers in lightly and drying 
them on the napkin. They should be half full of warm water with a bit of 
lemon floating in it When all have finished dessert, the hostess gives the 
signal that dinner is ended by pushing back her chair, and the ladies repair 
to the drawing-room, the oldest leading and the youngest following last^ and 
the gentlemen repairing to the library or smoking-room. In about half an 
hour, tea is served in the drawing-room with a cake-basket of crackers or 
little cakes, the gentlemen join the ladies, and after a little chat over their 
cups, all are at liberty to take leave. 

It is, of course, presupposed that the host carves, and carves well. If he 
does not he should forego the pleasure of inviting his friends to dinner, or tha 
dinner should be from chops, ribs, or birds which do not require carving. 



THE HOST AND HOSTESS. 447 

In making up a dinner party, it is all important to know who will accept ; 
and invitations, which may be written or printed, and should be sent by mes- 
senger and never mailed to persons in the same town, should receive a prompt 
reply, aday's delay being the extreme limit. The simplest form of invitation 
and reply is best, but both must be formal, this being one of the occasions on 
^V'hicli the wings of genius must be promptly clipped. Ten minutes beyond 
the appointed time, is the utmost limit of tardiness admissible in a guest, and 
ten minutes early are quite enough. 

THE HOST ANU HOSTESS. 

Those who entertain should remember it is vulgar hospitality, exceedingly 
annoying to guests, to overload plates, or to insist on a second supply. If 
the guest wants more, he knows that it is a delicate compliment to a dish 
to pass his plate the second time. Too great a variety of dishes is also a 
coarse display. A few cooked to a nicety and served with grace, make the 
most charming dinners. A«sensible bill of fare is soup, fish with one vege- 
table, a roast with one or two vegetables and a salad and cheese, and a dessert. 
Parties should be made up of congenial persons, and the table should never 
he crowded. Novel dishes are great strokes of policy in dinners, but no wise 
housewife will try experiments on new dishes on such an occasion. The 
carver should serve meat as he cuts it, so far as possible, and not fill the 
platter with hacked fragments. It is ill-bred to help too abundantly, or to 
flood food with gravies, which are disliked by many. Above all, the plate 
should be served neatly. Nothing creates such disgust as a plat« bedaubed 
"with gravy or scattered food. It may be taken for granted that every one 
-will take a piece of breast; and after that is served, it is proper to ask, " What 
part do you prefer? " The wings and legs should be placed crisp side upper- 
most, the stuffing should not be scattered, and the brown side or edge of 
elice should be kept from contact with vegetables or gravy, so that its deli- 
cacy maj' be preserved. Water should be poured at the right hand. Every 
thing else is served at the left. The hostess should continue eating until all 
guests have finished. Individual salt'<iishes are used at breakfasts, but not 
at dinners, — a cruet, with salt dish and spoon, at each end of the table, being 
preferred as giving the table less of a hotel air. The salt dishes should be 
neatly filled. Jellies and sauces are helped on the dinner plate and not on 
side dishes. If there are two dishes of dessert, the host may serve the most 
substantial one. Fruit is served after puddings and pies, and cofTee last. 
In pouring coffee, the sugar and cream is placed in the cup first. If milk is 
used, it should be scalding hot. Some prefer to make coffee strong, then 
weaken it with scalding hot milk, and pour into cups in which cream and 
sugar have previously been placed. For t€a it is better to pour first and then 
add cream and sugar. In winter plates should be warmed, not made hot. 

INDIVIDUAL MANNEBS. 

Manners, at table and elsewhere, are made for the convenience and com- 
fort of men, and all social observances have now, or have had at some time, 
a good reason and sound common sense behind them. It must be remem* 



448 INDIVIDUAL MANNERS. 

bered, however, that the source of all good manners is a nice perception of, 
and kind consideration for, not only the rights, but the feelings and even the 
whims of others. The customs of society are adopted and observed to en- 
able us to be more agreeable, or at least not disagreeable, to friends And 
nowhere is the distinction between the gentleman and the boor more marked 
than at the table. Some persons are morbidly sensitive, and even slight im- 
proprieties create disgust ; and every true gentleman is bound to respect their 
sensitiveness and avoid giving pain, whether in sympathy with the feeling 
or not. 

As this is not an etiquette book, we can only give a few hints. Onoe 
seated at table, gloves are drawn off and laid in the lap under the napkin, 
which is spread lightly, not tucked in. Raw oysters are eaten with a fork ; 
soup from the side of a spoon without noise, or tipping the plate. The mouth 
should not go to the food, but food to the mouth. Eat without noise and 
with the lips closed. Friends will not care to see how you masticate your 
food, unless they are of a very investigating turn of mind. Bread should 
be broken, not cut, and should be eaten by morsels, and not broken into soup 
or gravy. It is in bad taste. to mix food on the plate. Fish must be eaten 
with the fork. Macaroni is cut and cheese crumbled on the plate, and 
eaten with a fork. Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never 
cut with a knife. Game and chicken are cut, but never eaten with the bones 
held in the fingers. Oranges are peeled without breaking the inner skin, 
being held meantime on a fork. Pears are pared while held by the stem. 
Cherry-stones, or other substances which are to be removed from thG mouth, 
are passed to the napkin held to the lips, and then returned to the plate. 
Salt must be left on the side of the plate, and never on the table-cloth. Cut 
with the knife, but never put it in the mouth; the fork must convey the 
food, and may be held in either hand as convenient (Of course, when the 
old-fashioned two-tined fork is used, it would be absurd to practice this 
rule. ) Food that can not be held with a fork should be eaten with a spoon. 
Never help yourself to butter or any other food with your own knife or fork. 
Never pick your teeth at table, or make any sound with the mouth in eating. 
Bread eaten with meat should not be buttered. Bread and butter is a dish 
for dessert Eat slowly for both liealth and manners. Do not lean your 
arms on the table, or sit too far back, or lounge. Pay as little attention as 
possible to accidents. When asked " what do you prefer?" name some pan 
at once. When done, lay your knife and fork side by side on the plat«, with 
handles to the right When you rise from your chair leave it where it 
stands. Of course, loud talking or boisterous conduct is entirely out of place 
at table, where each should appear at his best, practicing all he can of the 
amenities of life, and observing all he knows of the forms of good society. 

BREAKFAST PARTIES. 

Breakfast parties are becoming fashionable in cities, because less formal 
and expensive than dinners, and quite &s agreeable to guests. The courses, 
which are usually fewer in number, are served precisely as described for din* 



BREAKFAST PARTIES— TABLE OUTFIT. 449 

ners. Oatmeal porridge is a favorite and healthful first course, and oranges^ 
melons, and all fruits are delicious breakfast dishes. The variety of omelets 
is also a great resource, and hundreds of other delicacies and substantials 
are described elsewhere. But in breakfast— and the same is true of din- 
ners — ^it is better to have a few, a very few, dishes delicately and carefully 
cooked, than to attempt more and have them less perfect. In fact the trouble 
often lies in attempting too many, and the consequent hurry in the kitchen. 
JLt breakfast, the cotfee is set before the mistress, with cups in their saucer* 
in front of it, in one or two rows. The meat with plates is set before the 
master. For an ordinary table one caster in the center is sufficient. Fruit 
is served^rst; then oatmeal or cracked wheat, next meat and vegetables, fol- 
lowed by hot cakes and coffee. Meats are covered, and cakes are brought 
in between two plates. Butter is put on in small pats with lumps of 
ice about it Honey or maple syrup, for cakes or hot biscuits, is served in 
saucers. A breakfast-table may be spread attractively with a white cloth, 
and a scarlet and white napkin under each plate, with white table-mats 
with a scarlet border. 

For evening parties it is often less expense and trouble to place supper in 
the hands of a regular confectioner, but for small card or literary parties the 
trouble need not be great. For regular reception evenings, ices, cakes and 
chocolate are enough. 

In all cases where no " help" is employed it is better to have some one of 
the family wait upon the table, the daughters taking turns in serving, as the 
pleasure of a meal is greatly marred by two or three persons jumping up 
every now and then, for articles needed. 

TABLE OUTFIT. 

In the selection of table-wares, there is a wide field for the exercise of 
taste, and those whose purses permit, need not be at a loss to find the most 
elegant and artistic designs. An admirable table outfit is an elegant dessert- 
set, all the pieces of which, except the plates, may decorate the table during 
the whole dinner, and the rest of white and guilt china. Some have table- 
ware decorated to match the colors of the dining-room, or sets of different 
patterns for each course, or harlequin sets in which each piece may be of dif- 
ferent pattern or even of different ware. Chinese and Japanese sets are also 
fashionable. In every case, ware should be the best of its kind, and for eco- 
nomy's sake should be plain, so that broken pieces may be readily and 
cheaply replaced. Light knives and forks, heavy tea-spoons, and thin glasses 
for water are most elegant. The chairs should have no arms to interfere with 
ladies' dresses, and to prevent noise the legs should be tipped with rubber. 

CLEARING THE TABLE. 

Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost or wasted. When each 
neal is over, if you do not have a crumb-cloth under the table, which, when 
the chairs are removed, can be lifted carefully at the edges and the crumbs 
shaken into the center, it is best to take a broom and sweep the crumbs 
£ghtly under the table until the dishes and victuals are removed, then brush

450 CLEARISO THE TABLE, 



on a dust pan. To clear the table, bring in a dish-pan, gather up all the 
, silver, cups and saucers, butter and sauce plates, and glassware, carry to the 
kitchen, place tliem in the sink and return with the pan. Scrape the plates 
as clean as possible and put in, add platters and vegetable dishes, saving all 
the remnants of food that are to be kept, on smaller dishes, to be taken to 
the cellar or refrigerator. To wash the dishes, have clear hot water in the 
pan, and first wash the silver without soap or cloth, using only the hands; 
if any are greasy, wipe with a soft paper before putting in the water, rinae 
in clear hot water and wipe off immediately on a perfectly dry, soft, clean 
towel ; in this way the silver is kept bright, and does not get scratched. Add 
some soap in the water, make a suds, wash the glassware, rinse and wipe 
dry. Next take cups and saucers and so on, leaving those most greasy till 
the last Always keep a clean dish-cloth. One lady writes, "I have smelt 
a whole houseful of typhoid fever in one sour, dirty dish-rag." Many pre- 
fer the use of three dish-cloths, one for the nicest articles, one for the greasy 
dishes, and one for the pots and kettles, keeping each cloth perfectly sweet 
and clean, and, after using it, washing, rinsing, and hanging to dry on a 
tmall rack kept for this purpose. The towel for wiping dishes may also dry 
here. A dish mop or swab for washing small deep articles is convenient 

Let no one suppose that because she lives in a small bouse, and dines on 
iiomely fare, that the general principles here laid down do not apply to her. 
A small house is more easily kept clean than a palace; taste may be quite 
as well displayed in the arrangement of dishes on a pine table as in 
grouping the silver and china of the rich. Skill in cooking is as readily 
shown in a baked potato or a johnny-cake as in a canvass-back duck. The 
charm of good housekeeping lies in a nice attention to little things, not in a 
superabundance. A dirty kitchen and bad cooking have driven many a hus- 
band and son, and many a daughter too, from a home that should have been 
a refuge from temptation. " Bad dinners go hand in hand with total depiaT* 
ity ; while a properly fed man is already half saved.'

HOW TO GIVE A DINNER 



Ajd oral table, as given in diagram, appears to be the most sociable; and, al- 
though it is against all precedent, the host and hostess should sit at the 
two sides of the table instead of the two ends, although in diagram it is ar- 
rajiged for the two ends. Sitting at the sides of the table the host and hostess 
are nearer their guests, and are better able to enjoy their society and to enter- 
tain them. No pains should be spared to have the most comfortable chairs. 
Under each chair should be placed a stool or hassock for ladies, or for such as 
may require it. The table linen should be nicely laundried. The tiible cloth 
should not overlap the table so much as to be in the way of the guests. If 
napkins are too stiff they cannot be folded well nor used with comfort. Under 
the cloth there should be a thick piece of green baize the exact size of the table. 
Wlien carrins is to be done on the table alarge napkin should be placed before 
the car\'er to be removed in case of accidents. It is also advisable to have a 
supply of napkins at hand to use in case the table cloth is soiled dui-ing dinner. 
The use of mats on the table is to be deprecated, as the thick baize should pro- 
tect the table from the heat of the dishes. Tlie better way is to put dishes on 
the table without covers, and thus avoid a puff of fast condensing vapor in the 
faces of the guests. In first class dinners tiiC soup tureen is not placed on the 
table, but soup is served from it from the sideboard. The soup having been 
dispcraed of, the fish is brought to the table, and sei-ved by host or hostess. On 
the removal of fish, four entrees judiciously selected, and each a complete dish 
in itself, are handed round; or two are placed on the table one at each end, and 
the other two handed round. When guests have nearly finished these, two re^- 
lieves or pieces de resistance are jplaced on the table one at each end, and each 
likewise a complete dish in itsel£ They in turn give place to a couple of roasta 
or roast and boiled, or poultry, or game, and two or more entremets should be 
served with it. Then comes the dessert. A reference to diagrams will further 
illustrate tins. The above bill of fare is only given in the way of suggestion. 
Six courses may be made of it, or four as preferred. It is proper to hand abound 
salad with roasts of all kinds, or with plain boiled or fried fish. If game or 
poultry do not figure in the bill of fare, one of the relieves should be a roast, 
and the entreme^ should be served with iL Cheese sliould not be i>laced on 
the table, but handed around cut in thin slices. It should be eaten before the 
entremets prepared as some fancy dish, or if served in natural state, use Far- 
mescm cream or some first class cheese. The reason of the English custom 
of eating cheese after dessert lies in the declining fashion of wine drinking after 
dinner. In France cheese is always served with the dessert. In hot weather all 
drinks should be cooled; this should be done from without, except water, in 
which a lump of ice is not disagreeable. The lady of the house should see tha& 
the appearance of the dessert is such that each dish, the fruit especially, should, 
with the help of flowers and leaves, be made into an elegant ornament. Fern 
leaves are well adapted for this purpose. It is most artistic to use, when prac- 
ticable, the leaves of the fruit used on the table. Artificial leaves should never 
be employed. No fruits or confectionery, should appear except such as are 
fi^oodtoeat. Canned fruits and the many colored productions of the confec- 
tioner should always be of the best and purest. There is no limit to the num« 
ber of dishes which go to form dessert but it is better to have too little than to 
have inferior kinds or damaged fruit on the table. A dish of diy biscuit and

one of oliyes should never be omitted, bnt the latter should be served in water 
and not in the liquor they were preserved in. The position of each dish is im* 
portant. These should be arranged rightly, both for the effect and appeaiwoe 
and also so as to be aooessible to the guests. The dessert should be kept dished 
up in an adjoining room or if necessary in warm weather in a cool place to be 
brought in when wanted. Except when dessert is to be handed round* gos^is 
prefer to help themselves and to be free from the presence of waiters. Use 
water in thennger ghisses perfumed with a few dropsof rose water or lavender. 
Coffee as bright as well decanted wine is the proper conclusion of every 
dinner. The plate, the dinner, and dessert service, the glass^ etc., go a great 
way towards making the dinner table look pretty and inviting. The most 
fashionable dinner service is of plnin white with a small fillet of gold and the 
^rms or crest and motto of the owner painted on the flat rim of the plates and 
djshes. The glass should also be engraved with the same heraidio device. 
Dessert service made entirely of glass are sometimes used and has a pretty 
effect. One thing not to be forgotten is to be sure and have good bread; if you 
do not, procure rolls from your baker. 

DiSTBUCnONB TO WAITEBS. 

L In the ^'demi-Russe* dinner here given, the ^joints or dishes are to be 
carved before placing before the person serving them. 

2. The person serving fills plates according to the preference of each gaest. 
The waiter then bands the plate, and if vegetables or sauce accompanies the 
dish, will also hand these to the guest at the same time he does the plate, unless 
a second waiter does this. 

3. If waiter is asked for tea, coffee, or chocolate, he will furnish these from 
sideboard. If &>ked for water, he will take it from pitcher on table. 

4. The waiter will S(e that the proper number of plates are placed before 
server for each separate dish of the course. 

6. Ko plates are placed on the table for this styleof dinner. Only a napkin 
^ith a roll or square of bread in it is placed where the plate would be. Also 
two knifes, one large, one small, and two forks and a spoon, also glass for 
water^See diagram.) 

6. Furm»h both ends of the table alike, and, in addition to the servidS 
placed for each guest, furnish a carving knife and fork, a fish slice and prong 
Also furnish a gravy spoon with each fresh dish placed at the ends of the table. 

7. If two kinds of soup or in case where any two dishes are to be served, 
place one at each end of the table. If there are three or four entrees, place the 
two leading ones at ends of the table, and hand around the others. 

8. Always hand the sauce for each particular dish to the guest partaking of 
that dish. 

9. If asked for the pepper or anything else from the cruet or castor, hand the 
cruet or castor entire to toe guests. 

10. If asked for any condynent such as French mustard, olive, chow-chow, 
etc. etc., hand bottle, if in a bottle, or glass, if in a glass, to the guesti with the 
prong or fork, and let the guest serve himself, then i)lace back where it was on 
the table. 

11. Be on the alert, and in case of accident, hand your napkin to the gaest, 
and if neccessarv remove his plate, remedy the trouble as soon as possible, lay 
down a mat on the soiled cloth, and replenish with knives and forks, napkin, 
etc. , and procure the gm st a fresh supply of what he was eating. 

12. When you place dcFs^ert on the table, place a dessert plate, dessert knife 
and fork also spoon, to each plate. Remember also the fin<rer bowL 

13b If ice cream is served, serve it independent of the tiead of the table, as 
his work is through with the first courses. The usual form of ice cream now is 
bricks. 

14. When dessert is half through, hand the menu, or bill of fare, to each 
guest, calling his attention to the ice cream. Take nis order and fill it. 

15. If any guest has already ordered ice cream, do not offer the bill of fare 
to bJTn - 

16. If it is decided to have boquets, called a "boutonniere^" for the guests. 



HOW TO GIVE A DINNER. 463 

then place one in aglBss or silver holder by the plate of each lady and genile- 
znBn, tinlees, as is eometimesthe case, those for the gentlemen are plamd on 
the napkins without a -holder. 

17. if salad accompanies any dish — a salad is always in order — ^hand it 
Around to each gaest 

18. The host sits at the head of the table; the hostess opposite him at the 
the other end of the table. 

19. The soap is always placed before the hostess, and if the salad is placed 
on the table, that is also jilaced before her, and any portion of the dessert she 
may desire to serve, and is handed from her to the gnests. 

20. The waiter will remove each person's plnte as soon as he has finished. 

21. Be quick, yet do not appear iu a hurry. Waiters should not speak to each 
other unless it is positively necessary. • 

22. The proper dress for a waiter is a dark dress coat ondtrowsers, while vest 
and neck-tie. A waitress should wear a dark dress with white apron and cap. 
Both should wear lit?ht slippers or boots, and make as little noise as poi^sible. 

23. If rneniis or bills of f ire are used, i)lace one at each plate. 

24. If you have to lay a table for dinner a la livsse, the dessert is alwnys 
placed on the table first, and should be placed tastefully around the center of 
liowers. Note diajrram for demi-llusse dinner; the dessert is placed round the 
edge of the table, that is if the hostess desires to have it thus placed. In a din- 
ner a la Russp, tae joints or dishes are broujjht in one at a time and carved by 
the host, and as he carves each plate, .the waiter hands it on a silver tray. In 
the denii-Iittsse J the joint? are carved before being placed before the server. 
(See diagrams.) In some dinners the joints or dishes are carved and handed 
to the guests for them to help themselves. In this case each guest must be fur- 
nished with a plate which of course must be placed — with napkin and roll on 
it — when the cloth is laid. The waiters should confer with the cook and the 
cook with the housekeeper or hostess, and have all these points settled before- 
hand. If there is a butler, it devolves on him to see all these points settled and 
to instruct his as^^istants. Sometimes the host or hostess will direct each gueet 
to his seat, sometimes the butler will do it, and sometimes the waiters. 

SITMMlfnt BBEAKFAST FOB TEN. (TWO BE8EBVED PLATES.) 

FinsT Counsjc, Meixjn — ^^Vhen table is laid (see diat^ram) guests enter and lake 
peats. Waiters place tea and coffee urns and bring melon. The gentleman 
serving asks each guest if he will be helped t3 melon. If the answer be yes, wait- 
er receives plate from server and hands to guest, exchanging plat^ and return- 
ing empty plate to sen'er, who places melon on it for another guest and so on. 
As soon as all are served, or have refused a second helping, the waiter removes 
the remains of the melon, and replaces it with dish for second course. The la- 
dy at the head of the table asks each guest to partake of t«a, coffee, or choco- 
late. If any accept, waiter receives it and hands to guest. Asking guests to 
take tea etc., in first course, is a mere matter of form, as it is seldom taken 
until second course. Still the question must be asked, and waiter ready to 
serve it. 

8xx30Ni> CouESB — In the place of melon, a dish of fish — fried perch, smelts, 
trout, or whatever is selected. Scmce Tartare is a proper accompaniment. 
Decorate dish of fish with shrimps or olives cut in half, or with little 
bunches of parsley with shrimp placed on it. Waiters also remove' 
first set of dessert plates used for melon, and replace with a size lar- 
ger, medium breakfast plates. The waiter then receives a supply of 
fish from the person who serves it, hand t& the guests, receiving empty plates, 
and helping guests to what accompaniments they desire. Another waiter asks 
if gnest will take coffee or tea, and supplies it from party serving it. Potatoes 
are handed round (with either meat or fish.) If two kinds, present one in each 
hand for guest to help himself. 

Thibd Goubse — ^Young chicken sauced with cream gravy, surrounded with 
potatoes a laneige. Waiter removes fish of second course, and replaces with 
Tonng chicken, then attends to wants of guests as in second course, remember- 
ing to ask each if he wiU take tea or coffee; also asking each if he will take his

tea or coffee wanner. Glean plates same size as for second course, must be 

■applied to each (meat. 

FouBTH CouBSB — PoEched eggs on toast, or anchovy toast. Waiter removea 
chicken aiid replaces it with di^h of poached eggs, and tarnishes clean plates. 
Party serving asks each gaest if he can help him, and waiters serve sb in the 
other cases. Lady dispensing tea or coffee asks gaests if they will be helped 
to warmer tea or coffee. If any one accer>t», waiter hands clean cap andsanoer. 
from the Bideboaid to lady serving and then hands it to the gaest. If milk ia 
asked for he procures from sideboard and hands to the gaest. Waiter also 
watches the gaests and sapplies them with hot cakes, receiving a dish of hot 
ijones for that purpose every five minutes, handing dish of cakes to gueat who 
'helps himself. 

FinH Ck>UR8B — ^Littl e fillets of porter house steak with tomatoes a la mayon^ 
naiae. Waiter puts on steak in place of plate of poached eggs,* and caters to 
wants of guests as before. Wliile guests are eating this course, the waiters or 
an extra waiter, as quietly as possible relieve the table of the castor, pickles, 
sauces, dressing ana butter. But not till the last moment must this be done, 
at the same time asking theguests if they require more. The dessert or rather 
fruit, sixth course, is then brought in and placed where steak was; arrange 
as quicklv as possible, the service remaining on the table in neat order, re- 
move each guest's plate, aud again furnish dessert plates, At a signal from 
lady at head of ttible, waiter hands around fruit to guests, each guest suppling 
himself, nnlcss the person before serving the other dishes serves this, in which 
case waiter Bui)plie3 each as before. Waiter also sapplies each gnest with tea 
or coffee, and hands around cake, biscuit, etc At this course a finger ^asa 
should be supplied to each guest. 

Sixth GouBSB — Peaches quartered, sweetened or half frozen or any fruit de- 
cided upon. Carry out the instructions given in the fifth course. In some 
breakfasts order is reversed, and fruit is served in first course only. In this 
case various fruits are placed on table, and allowed to remain till end of break- 
fast so that guests may partake at any time. In first cl :fls breakfasts fruit 
forms the first and last course, but waiters should be instru.ted beforehand, 
which plan is to be followed. 

INSTBUOnONS TOWAITPBS. 

First, air breakfast room well. See that everything has been dusted. Next 
lay cloth — white is the fashion now — and see that it is free from wrinkles and 
creases. See that all articles for tablb are perfectly clean. Place craet«, cas- 
tors, sauces, salts, spoon, sugar, syraj), aud everj'tl.ing that will not hurt to 
stand a while, in propt r positions on table. ^See diagram. ) Then a few min- 
utes before calling break fsu^t, add cake, sw.eet biscuit, muffins, etc. Just before 
guests begin to come, add flowers and salad. Note position of tea tray con- 
taining tea cups, also urns. Note also plate at head, which will show yon 
what cutlery and plate to put near that plate. ^ Place a glass for each plate for 
water. Place the ])lates bottom np with napkin on the top of each. At end of 
table where dishes are served, (see diagram for melon,) place ;>late, cutlery 
and glasses for other guests, also carver and carving fork and knife rest, also a 
fish trowel, also a few reserve plates. In event of an accident they are nandy. 
If any guest require bread, supply it from sideboard. A small roll should be 
placed in each guest's napkin. If this is not done, place two plates of roUs on 
table, or puss a dish of rolls. If any one requires a second roll, he asks for it 
In no case place napkins in gla-^ses, but on plates, whether rolls are in them or 
not. As soon as guests are seated, ask if they prefer milk or water. If water, 
fill from the water jug. If milk, fill from the milk pitcher. Both jog and 
pitcher are kepton sideboard. -It is necessary to have a waiter or some one at 
head to see that all table a2>pointments are correct, and that other waiters dis- 
charge their duties. It is also neccessary to have some party outside breakfast 
room, to whom inside waiters may hand removes from table and from whom 
anything may be received for table. Waiters should be as auiet as possible and 
always Uioold go to left of guest There ehoold be an unaerBtanoing bef(»e-

lumd between oook. waiters and lady of the house, bo that each may Imow what 
Sb oominff next, ana how to manage. It Is the head waiter's place to see that salt ' 
Sb dryandfree from lumps, that castors are in good condition, and that oil, 
mustard, and salad dressing are fresh, etc. For further instructions refer to 
diagi'am, and explanation of courses, and articles on dinners and breakfasts. 
It is best to place two or three extra cups and saucers in tray to use in an emerg- 
ency . The sugar, milk and cream should be placed before hostess if she is to 
dispense them, or she may simply dispense tea and coffee, in which case the 
sngar and cream should be passed by waiters, or put within reach so that guests 
may help them»elyes. Chocolate will be served from sideboard, if a> all, and 
BUgar and cream handed with it for those who wish. 

Remember the diagram is given only to show the lay of table, number of ; 
dishes, also their nature, but these may be changed to suit. This does not show 
separate courses, but in case you wish to serve in courses, proceed as for dinner, 
observing the same rules* Lunches are similar to dinners; dishes are less in 
number, and not of a nature to require much carving. It is usual to have a 
larger variety of pastries, fruits, and confections than for dinner. In fact some 
iTmchesoojisist of sweets only. In winter lunch diagram two spaces are l.ft 
(Fig. 2 and 17) to be filled in with anything choice in the way of preserved 
fruits, fruit jelly, etc. In summer lunch No. 13 14, 15, IG, are for same pur- 
pose, fruit being more plentiful then. 

From the others it is easy to make up supper. These differ so, it is difficult 
to lay down a plan, as some make them a late dinner, some dinner and supper. 
To lay supper is an easy thing. The pages of this book tell how to provide a 
good supi)er whether for family or for party. In lunches the plan known as 
demi-Russe has been adopted, a compromise between the entire Russian, and 
the old fashioned English plan of placing every dish upon the table. The dia- 

Sam calls for two carvers as servers, one at head and one at foot end of table, 
at is to say if dishes are carved by per ~ons sitting at these places. Place the 
dishes before them whole, tastefully garnished. If dishes are first carved and 
then placed before them, they will simply serve them. In either case place 

Elates as shown in diagram, and as fast as each plate is suppUed, let waiter 
and to each guest. Carving knife and fork must be place I on table to serve 
with, to Wready in ca>e carving is imperfectly done. In case cook or mistress 
wishes to display her skill in dishing up, garnishing dish, whatever it may be, 
waiter locates it in proper place on table, and while company are engaged in 
talking, quietly removes it to sideboard, and quickly aud deftly carves it, gar- 
nishing as well as time will allow, then replace in its original place. Another 
plan is to carve, arrange nicely on the dish, and then garnish tastefully, and 
place before carver or server. If tea, coffee of chocolate are included in lunch, 
serve from sideboard. Waiters generally have less to do at lunch than at din* 
ner because guests are under less constraint aud of teaer help each other. 

WHAT ABE PBOPEB DISH£S FOB EACH COUBSS. 

I. Five small raw oysters f on the deep shell, so as to retain the liquor) just 
before dinner, and put at each plate before the dining room is opened. A. 
colored doiley may be put under them on each plate. If oysters are not in 
season, substitute small round dams. If weather is quite warm, let them rest 
on eacn plate in a bed of cracked ice. In either case quarter of a lemon, on 
each plate. With clams, red pepper within reach. 

II. After fish, either patties, bits of toast, each supporting a single selected 
mushroom and saturated with brown sauce, or so m 3 similar trifle. Whatever 
is used, let but one be put on each plate, and before the plates are handed. 

in. If you have more than one meat, let the first be relatively substantial, 
and the second of a lighter character. For instance — & filet of beef might be 
followed by chicken croquettes, or a boiled turkey, (which is never really good 
without oyster sauce, ) by mutton chops with almond paste. Other things, even, 
let a roost prec^e a boil, but put the heavier thing first. 

IV. After meats, entrees, such as croquettes, calves' brains, devilled kidneys, 
oysters, fried or boiled, etc. 

y. With game, jelly; though true epicures ddn't take it. The salad is fre-

qvectly Berved with the frame, though for those who wish both jelly and salad, 
thif> ifl awkward, if jelly be served. 

VI. After salad, cheese, either one of medium strength, or two kinds— on© 
pun^nt, one mild. The waiter had best hand both kinds together (previonBly 
cat up) for tite company to choose. With this, hard crackers. 

Vlf. If yon elaborate your dessert let the order be; paltry or pudding, ices, 
fmite, nuts, and raisins, bon-bons. 

X. Black coffee in small cups. Sugar, (in lumps,) to be passed separately. 

This is quite frequently reserved till the ladies have left the table and served 
to them in the parlor, and to the gentlemen in the dining room. 

OENKBAIi HINTP. 

Never let two kinds of animal food or two kinds of pastry be eaten from the 
ftame plate: make a fresh course of each. 

Cards on plates, bearing the names of the company, so as to seat them with 
reference to congeniality, are very important. For host or hostess to 
marshal them after they are in the dining room is not nearly so easy as for 
them to marshal themselves by the cards, and the host and hostess are sure, in 
the confusion of the moment to get people placed exactly as they did not in- 
tend to have them . . , , ^ ., .1 X i^i.- 1 J 

Cut pieces of bread about four mches long, two wide, and two thick, and 
always place a piece beside each plate in setting the table. 

Finger bowls are to be passed after pastry on plates with doileys between 
the plates and the bowls. The plates are to be used for fruits and nuts, if 
there are any. If none are handed, the finger bowl will not be taken from the 
plate. The finger bowl should be filled about one-third, contain a slice of 
lemon, and in very warm weather, a bit of ice. 

It is well to have a dish, atoneside,independent of any that may be on the 
table, with grapes cut into small bunches, and oranges and large fruits halved. 
If fruit decorating the table is to be used, let it be removed and prepared 

before it is passed. ^ * i. • j , i i. 

Avoid cane seat-; in a dining-room. Where fine fabrics and laces ju^ kept on 
them so long a time continously (longer than anywhere else) they play havoc. 

One plate should be at each seat. The raw oysters or clams, on a separate plat^ 
are placed on the first plate. So with the soup. The first plate is exchanged 
for the plate with the fish. Always have a stock of plates m reserve suflacient 
for all the courses and properly warmed. The most decorated plates are best en- 
joyed about the time of salad or cheese and at dessert. ^ . ». 

It saves the waiter's time to start with at least two forks, and two kmves by 
each plate. It is not bad to have three. One knife should be of silver, for the 
flsh. Silver knives are, of course, essential for fruit. 

Napkins are never supposed to appear a second time without washing. 
Hence napkin rings are domestic secrets, and not for compMiy. 

Never let two kinds of animal food or two lands of pastry be eaten from the 
same plate: make a fresh course of each. .^, , ^ * i. * ^ x j •*. 

Always change knives and forks, or spoons with plates. As before stated, it 
is well to start with two or three relays of implements by the plates. 

Don't have over two vegetables with a course. Let them be offered together 
on the same waiter. At a large dinner, you can have two varieties m the same 
course, i. e„ two soups, two fish, two meats, etc., letting thewaiter offer the 
guest a plate of each at the same time, the guest choosing between them. 

Everybody is always out of bread: prevent it if you can. 

One good waiter is worth mwc/i more than two poor ones. 

Two hours is long enough to serve any dinner that Ohnstians ought to eat, 

three hours and a half is too long. ^^ * v s u* mi. x. 2.

Fresh i)ork and veal are seldom seen at the tables of those who know how to 
dine or to digest. Bat a ham, baked with sugari is an very honor- 
able companion af er fish, all the way down to ^.ime. It is ontu an i^coesscry, 
though, never the basis of a decent dinner. It should be liandea aroond sUceu, 
after the regular coarse is served. 

In place of salad some specially nice vegetable, sneh as asparagus, green 
corn, or a well-cooked cauliflower may last .fully be served as a ^eparate course. 
In fact there is much to be said in f .vor of a'way ^ perving separately a vege- 
table which does not, like potatoes, stewed tomatoes, bean:^, pe:is, etc., seem 
the natural ac<;essory of some meat. 

Chesterfield's idea that a dinner party should not include fewer than the 
Crraces or more than the muses, ha<« the approval of later generations. Especi- 
ally commendable is the rule where waiters are scant. A superlatively good 
waiter in a well-ordered house can manipulate eight people.- if he has an as- 
sistant in the pantry to prepare everything for him. If you ask one person 
more, you'll spoil the fun of nine, unless yon get another waiter. 

Liast and not least, dining rooms are alwa-s too hot. 

THE QT7ESTI0N OF WINXS. 

This is best answered by remarking that in first class — and in first class din^ 
ners, breakfast Sj etc. onbjj a profusion of wines is admissable, sometimes as 
many as a dozen different wines being then served. Tiiis does not denote ele- 
gance or good taste, but rather a low taste and depraved appetite, and is more 
suited to wine pui)pers or parties. Three to four wines are suflicient to give the 
host tiiecredit of having treated his guests "right royally." But they should be 
of the choicest kinds. 

Oft .-n times one clioice wine is made to do s.Tvice for all coiirses, such as 
clioice claret or champagne. 

Many first class dinners are given without any wine, at either dinner or des- 
sert, Otliers again are strrved ^ithuut wiue, but wine is served at dessert. 
Sometimes not till after dessert. In which cjlso, either with or after dessert, 
let it be a good champagne. This is nieiitioiu'd to disabuse tho minds of any who 
think it imperative, that wine should be scrvect with all or any M\ri of a conrse 
of a dinner. It is purely a mater of tasio and sensible persons or guests will 
make no comments. Still if yoa decide to have wines, let it be, say three, and let 
it be a choice sherry with tho soup, claret with first course after the fish, and 
champagne with the roa-ts. 

Should you decide to serve a fourth wine, let it be a chateau yquem, to be 
served with an entree. 

It is before stated, if you decide to have one wine only, and that a cham- 
pagne, serve it just after the fish. 

Many serve claret during the entire dinner, it matters not how many other 
kinds are served, in which case claret is on the lahle, so long as the service is 
on it, and other wines are handed round, or waited to be asked for and then 
handed. Some also do this, makingchainpagne the standard wine. Cham- 
pagne is preferable to claret. Wiiere one wine only is served, claret is not 
offered. It is a mistake to serve a strong, high spirit wine at the commeace- 
ment of a dinner. 

To many it will be well to remark that, as a rule white wines, such as 
Sauterne, Rhine, etc are served with raw oystei-s, when raw oysters, as tiiey 
sometimes do, precede soup, or af ler the oy ters, and just before the soup. 

With soup or fish, Stierry or Maderia is most approved; with the meats cham- 
pagne, with game, claret or any red wine. 

Some serve claret after the fish, as it is a light wine, and can be drank instead 
of water. In dessert, let it be superior sherry, Port, or Bur;,nindy, or some 

fine wine. 

Sometimes liquors, such as Maraschino, and Caracoa are served in liquor 
glasses with, or after dessert. Sometimes not served until after coffee. 

From the foregoing it will be conceded there is sufficient license to admit 
of your pleasing yourself somewhat, without fear of displeasing your gu^^ts. 
Anfrthing like an observance of the foregoing rule will sufQ e. 



THE KITCHEN. 



It is almost impossible to give any directions except in a general way re- 
garding the kitclien, as there is an endless variety of plans and arrangement. 
In no other room in the house are sunlight and fresh, jiKre air so indispen- 
sable as in the room where the most important work must be done. A long, 
narrow, dark kitchen is an abomination. Always furnish the kitchen well 
first, and if there is any thing left to spend on the parlor, well ; if not the 
money has been spent wisely. The main point is to systematize every thing, 
grouping such things as belong to any particular kind of work. For instance, 
in baking do not go to the china closet for a bowl, across the kitchen for 
the flour, and to the farther end of the ^mntry or store-room for an egg, when 
they may all just a^ well be within easy reach of each other. Study and 
contrive to bring order out of the natural chaos of the kitchen, and the head 
will save the hands and feet much labor. 

If kitchen floors are made of hard wood and simply oiled two or three 
times a year, no grease si)ot is made when grease drops on them, for it can be 
easily wiped up — carpet or paint is not advisable. Neither paint nor paper 
the walls, but once a year apply a coat of the good old-fashioned whitewash. 
Do not have the wood-work painted; the native wood well oiled and var* 
nished lightly is much the best finish. A wide, roomy dresser is a great 
convenience ; it should have two wide closets below and three narrower ones 
above, with a row of drawers at top of lower closets. Here should be kept 
all pots and kettles, sauce- pans, waffle-irons, kitchen crockery, tins, etc., all 
arranged and grouped together so as to be convenient for use. If possible, 
have good sliding doors, and at top and bottom of same have a narrow sliding 
panel for a ventilator, which should be closed when sweeping. By this ar- 
rangement every article of kitchen ware can be inclosed from the dust and 
flies. A well-appointed sink is a necessity in every kitchen, and should be 
near both window and range, so as to have light, and also be convenient to 
the hot water. It should Im? provided with a "grooved" and movable dish- 
drainer, set so as to drain into the sink. Always have bracket or wall lamps 
placed at each end, or at the sides, so that the room may be well lighted in 
the evening. When possible, a long table at the end of the sink, and so 
close to it that water can not drip between, on which to dress vegetables, 
poultry, game, etc., sivves time and stejis; and the good light, whit;hisa 
necessity in this part of the room, leaves no excuse for slighted or slovenly 
work. Under this table may be two drawers, with compartments in one for 
polishing materials, chamois leather, and articles needed for scouring tin and 
copper ; and in the other, articles for keeping the stove or range in order. 

(450) 



460 THE KITCHEN. 

Back of the table and sink, the wall should be ceiled with wood for three 
feet above them, and here may be put up galvanized iron hooks and nails on 
which to hang basting-spoons, ladles, cooking forks and spoons, the chop- 
ping-knife, cake-turner, etc. A set of drawers close at hand for salt, pepper, 
and spices is also convenient. There should never be bevel, beading, or mold- 
ing on kitchen window or door frames ; and the kitchen door, leading to the 
dining room, should be faced with rubber and closed with a not too strong 
spring. Not less than three large windows are desirable in every kitchen, 
which should be cheerful, pleasant, well ventilated, convenient and clean. 

Ill houses of the old style there was either no pantry at all, the kitohen 
being furnished with a dresser and shelves, or it was merely a small closet to 
hold the articles in less common use. In modem houses the pantry is next 
in importance to the kitchen, and it should be so arranged as to accommo- 
date all the appliances used in cookery, as well as the china, glass-ware, cut- 
lery, and other articles for the table, unless a dresser is used as before sug- 
gested. In a''ranging a plan for building, the pantry should receive careful 
consideration, as next in importance to the kitchen ; it should be sufficiently 
roomy, open into both the dining-room and the kitchen, and, in order to 
'* save steps," should be as convenient to the range or cooking-stove as eir- 
cumstances will allow. The window should be placed so as to give light 
without infringing on the shelving; the shelves should be so arranged as to 
not obstruct the light from it; the lower ones should be two and a half feet 
from the floor, and two feet or more in width, and project about three inches 
beyond the closets and drawers below ; and the part near the window, where 
there is no shelving, may be used for molding and preparing pastry, and 
such other work as may be most conveniently done here. Other shelves, or 
a china closet, should be provided for the china and other table furniture in 
every-day use. The pantry should 'have an abundance of drawers and 
closets, of which it is hardly possible to have too many — the upper closets 
for the nicer china and glass, and the lower ones to hold pans and other 
cooking utensils in less frequent use. The drawers are for table-linen and 
the many uses the housekeeper w^ill find for them. If possible the window 
should be on the north side, but in any case it should have blinds for shade, 
and a wire gauze or other screen to keep out flies. 

Use a cloth to wash potatoes. It is no trouble to keep one for this purpose, 
and it will save hands and time. Some prefer a brush. Tie a strip of muslin 
'11 the end of around stick, and use to grease bread and cake-pans, gem- 
irons, etc. Have two large pockets in your kitchen apron, and in one of 
them always keep a holder. A piece of clam or oyster shell is much better 
than a knife to scrape a kettle, should you be so unfortunate as to bum any 
thing on it. If you use a copper tea-kettle, keep an old dish with sour milk 
and a cloth in it, wash the kettle with this every morning, afterward washing 
off with clear wpter, and it will always look bright and new. Cut a very 
ripe tomato and rub over a kitchen table to remove grease. The juice will 
also remove stains from and whiten the hands. 

xf you use oil, buy the best kerosene. To test it, place a small quantity 



THE KITCHEN. 461 

in a tea-cup, and if it does not easily ignite when brought into contact with 
a lighted taper or match, it i3 good ; poor oil will ignite instantly. Keep 
oil in a ten-gallon can, with a faucet at the lower part, so as to draw off into 
a smaller can or lamp-filler ; set the large can in a cool, dark place ; keep all 
the articles used for cleaning, filling, and trimmiug lamps by themselves. 
For these purposes provide an old waiter (to hold the things), a lamp-filler, 
pair of scissors or a lamp-trimmer, box of wicks, soap, washing soda, and 
several soft cloths and towels, also a wire hairpin with which to keep open 
the vent in the burner. When lamps need an extra cleaning, add one tablo- 
8i)0on soda to a quart of water, being careful that none of the bronze ur 
gilding comes in contact with the soda The wick should touch the bottom 
of the lamp and be trimmed square across. When the wick becomes too 
short to carry up the kerosene, and if you have not timeto put in a new 
wick, a piece of cotton rag pinned on below will prove a good feeder. When 
the burners of lamps become gummy and prevent the wicks moving freely, 
boil them up in suds over the fire a short time, and they will become entirely 
clean and work well. Lamps may become incrusted inside with settlings 
from the oil, and ordinary washing will not remove it. Take soap-suds and 
fill ^e lamp about one-third full, then put in a little sharp sand, and shake 
vigorously. A few minutes will remove every particle of settlings. Always 
fill the lamps every day and in the day-time ; never fill a lamp after dark 
near a lighted lamp. When lighting a lamp turn the wick up slowly so that 
the chimney is gradually heated. When taking a lamp from a warm room 
into a cold one, first turn down the wick ; do not fill too full, as the heat ex- 
pands the oil and drives it out making the lamp dirty and dangerous. Never 
light or burn an almost empty lamp, as the empty space is nearly always 
filled with a very explosive gas. Before putting out a lamp turn it down 
until the wick is below the top of tube ; as if left above it the oil gradually 
works out through the wick and runs down over the burner and lamp. Turn 
the fiame down low, and wave a fan, book, or paper across the top of the 
chimney. Blowing down a chimney is very dangerous when a lamp is nearly 
empty and turned up high. Never start a fire with the oil. Buy the best 
lamp chimneys by the dozen. The best are cheapest, and it is convenient to 
have fresh ones on hand when one is broken at an inopportune time. A piece 
of sponge fastened on the end of a stick or wire is the best thing with which 
to clean lamp chimneys. Or, hold them over the nose of the tea-kettle when 
the kettle is boiling furiously. One or two repetitions of this process will make 
them beautifully clear. Of course they must be wiped upon a clean cloth. 

Fill new tin pans with boiling water (having a little soda in it), let stand 
on a warm part of the range for a while wash in strong soap-suds, rinse, and 
dry well. Scouring tins very often with whiting or ashes wears them out ; 
if properly taken. care of, washed in suds and thoroughly dried, they will 
not need scouring. 

Boil ashes or a bunch of hay or grass in a new iron pot before cooking in 
it; scour well with soap and sand, then fill with clean water, and boil one or 
two hours. To remove the taste of wood, first scald the ve&el well with 



462 THE KITCHEN. 

boiling water, letting the water remain in it till cold; then dissolve 
8aI-8oda or soda, (two pounds to a barrel of water) in lukewarm water, 
adding a little bit of lime to it, and wash the inside of the vessel well 
with this solution; afterward scald it well with plain hot water, and 
rinse it with cold water before you use it Knives for the table should 
never be used to cook with ; those for the former puri)ose may be a 
cheap plated set for every-day use, and should be kept by tliemselves, 
and never allowed to be used in the kitchen. Never place a range or 
cooking stove opposite a door or window if it can be avoided, as any 
draft will prevent the oven from baking well. 

A necessity in the kitchen, because a great protection against clothes 
taking fire, is a large kitchen apron made full length with bib, and sleeves 
if wished, the skirt to button close around the dress-skirt. A wooden mat 
(made by laying down six pieces of lath eleven inches long, one inch wide, 
and an inoh apart, and nailing across these, at right angles, six other similar 
pieces, about the same distance apart) is a great protection to the kitchen 
table, which should be of ash. Hot kettles and pans from the stove may be 
set on this without danger, as the construction of the mat secures a circula- 
tion of air under it. 

It is the "little foxes that spoil the vines'* in the kitchen as well as else- 
where — ^the neglect of little things causes loss of time, patience and 
money. In building fires concentration is the important point: 1st, the fuel 
should be concentrated^ that is, put together in a compact heap ; and 2d, in a 
place on the grating where the draft can be concentrated upon it These two 
points gained it is an easy matter to produce a brisk fire. When the 
kindling, which must be dry and in sufficient quantity, is well started, the 
wood or coal, as the case may be, is so put on that the draft and flame will 
pass directly through the fuel. In starting a fire, all depends upon having 
the conditions right, and great loss of time, and even patience, is incurred 
if they are not provided. Always have wood in the box. This can gener- 
ally be done without taking special time for it, by remembering to bring 
some in when you pass the wood-pile without any thing in the hands. See 
that the wood-box is full at night, and the shavings and kindlings in their 
place. In the morning empty the ash-pan, or, better still, clean your stove 
or range at night. This can always be done, except in case of late suppers. 
When supper is ready, and there is no further use for the fire, open the 
oveu doors, take all the covers partly ofT the holes, and by the time the 
fc'iipper dishes and needful work in the preparation for breakfast is done, if 
the fire has been properly attended to, the stove will be cool enough to clean 
out, which should be thoroughly done, removing all the ashes or cinders 
from every part of it. This is a very particular work, as the comers often 
secrete quite an amount of ashes that must be removed if you would have 
a perfectly cleaned stove. Rap on the sides of the pipes, to dislodge the 
soot and ashes that collect there, sweep all out with a long-handled brush- 
broom and the stove is ready to receive the shavings, kindlings and wood 
for the fire. 



THE KITCHEN. 463 

Where there is a large amount of cooking to be done, the ashes shonid be 
cleared from under the slides of the ovens as often as twice a week in large 
or small families ; this will insure the OTen to bake wellf and always the 
mme, if the fire is properly arranged. 

Never on any account use coal-oil to make the fire burn more quickly. In 
making the fire, as soft wood bums more quickly than hard, it is better to 
have some with which to start it, filling up with hard wood. If the wood 
is good and properly placed you will have a bright clear flame, yielding a 
great amount of heat which should be utilized for cooking purposes, by so 
arranging the draught that none of it is wasted. This can only be done by 
one who so perfectly understands each part of it as to economize in the use 
of fuel. The fire needs constant attention, as it is poor economy to let the 
fire go partially out, as in adding fresh fuel the heat is wasted until the 
stove and oven are again heated to the right temperature for cooking. 

Fill the tea-kettle full of water and place on the stove, and if the fire is 
good it will boil Soon enough for use, and every time water is* used, add 
cold, so as to keep the supply good. The habit is almost universal to put a 
small quantity of water in the tea-kettle, aiming to have just enough for 
certain things, and if an extra demand occurs the kettle is empty, the fire 
is out, and the delay occasions no little trouble to both cook and mistress. 
When water has been made to boil no matter what is cooking in it, the fire 
may be very much lessened, as but little heat is required to keep it boiling. 
Bapid boiling does not hasten cooking, and the articles cooked are much 
better when boiled slowly. 

For general use copper and brass cooking utensils are not the best, be- 
cause of the great care necessary to keep them clean and free from poisonous 
deposits, a work that can ntver he trusted to servants. Care should b€i used in 
cooking in tin vessels, as they are liable to be afffected by acids, oils and salt, 
but not to the same extent as copper. For all ordinary cooking purposes, if 
tin vessels are kept clean and free from rust, no injury will result A little 
whiting or dry flour may be used to polish tin with. If a kettle is to be 
used for cooking fish, heat it first over the fire ; if an odor arises, it needs 
cleaning as above, before using. If the same gridiron has to be used for 
broiling steak, that has been used for fish, in addition to cleaning it as above, 
heat it over the fire, rub well with brown paper, then with an onion. In 
washing tin ware use soft water and soap, and wash well, rinse with hot 
water, wipe well, and put on the Tiearth or stove to dry perfectly ; once a 
week wash tin-ware in water in which a little sal-soda has been dissolved; 
take the suds for the pots and kettles (if not hot add more hot water), and 
wash and rinse thoroughly on the inside. To wash the outside of pots, ket- 
tles and all iron ware, place in a tub or large dish-pan, and with soap on 
cloth, rub them briskly and hard ; if necessary scrape with an iron spoon or 
old knife to get all dirt off, rinse in hot water, wipe, and place on stove to 
dry. If kept scrupulously clean, oysters, tomatoes, and even some delicacies 
that tire usually cooked in porcelain and granite ware, may be cooked nicely 
in iiYfU. 



464 . THE KITCHEN. 

Enameled ware may be cleansed by filling the vessel with hot water, with 
8oda dissolved in it — one ounce to a gallon ; let it boil twenty minutes; then 
if the stftin does not all come off, scour with fine sand or brick dust; rinse 
well with hot water and wipe dry. If by carelessness or accident, while 
making chow-chow, or any thing else, it becomes burned on the porcehun 
kettle, empty immediately, fill with water, put in about pint of wood-ashes 
to two gallons of water, let it boil twenty or thirty minutes; clean with sand 
or brick-dust as above, if it does not all come off. In either case, if unsuc- 
cessful the first time, repeat. To clean a brown porcelain kettle, boil peeJed 
potatoes in it. The porcelain will be rendered nearly as white as when new. 

To clean silver or plated ware, wash in clean hot water or lay in hot soda 
water a few minutes; then wipe dry with a canton flannel cloth, and polish 
with chamois skin. If silver powder is used for cleaning tarnished spots, 
care must be taken to brush out all the dust from the chased work on the 
plate. In the daily use of silver, wash in clean hot water and wipe dry 
with a canton flannel cloth. Never use soap in washing silver. 

Steel knives and forks are best cleaned by being scoured with bath brick, 
but some good "kitchen maids" always use the common brick pulverized, 
with good success. Have a properly made knife-box, with board extending, 
on which to lay the knife to scour, wet a cloth in hot water or soft soap and 
water, dip in the dust which has been previously shaved off; then rub 
briskly and hard until all spots are removed ; wash and rinse in clean, hot 
water and wipe dry. Never put a knife in hot fat, as it destroys the temper, 
and the knife is useless. 

The sink comes in for special .notice. Wash it daily with soap and water, 
rinse with clean boiling water, always rinsing with hot water after pouring sudi 
into it. This can not be insisted on too strongly, because of such great im- 
portance in the cleanliness of the kitchen. The old adage, "A time for 
every thing," applies here. On Mondays and Thursdays, during summer, 
pour hot water, containing a little chloride of lime, into the drains, and 
every Monday in winter. This will prevent all unpleasant or unhealthy 
odors. The use of soda in cleansing our wares greatly diminishes the quan- 
tity of soap needed. As a general thing, too much soap is used in washing 
dishes. Many good housekeepers do not allow soap used in washing dish» 
at all, except to clean tin and iron ware, dish cloths and sink. In cleaning 
an unpainted kitchen floor, if there are spots of grease on it, put some soft- 
snap (or lye, if to be had) in a tin-cup, kept for the purpose ; place on the 
stove until boiling hot; then pour a little on each spot and scour with ashes; 
wash the floor with soft hot water, rinse well, and, if the grease is not out 
the first time, try it again when the floor needs cleaning. Always remem- 
ber to rin.se thoroughly, changing the water when it becomes too dirty. In 
cleaning floors, tables, or wood- work, remember to rub always with, and not 
across, the grain of the wood. 

The breakage of dishes in some houses is fearful. There are very few 
families rich enough to bear it, much less the families of small means or just 
a competence. The mother is sick or wearied with the cares of the nursery,

and can not see to the putting away of the best china, which has been used 
because a friend dined with them. While conversing with her guest, she 
hears a crash in the kit<?hen. It is with difficult}' she remains calm until the 
^uest departs, when she finds a cup has fallen and cracked her nice tureen, 
and broke a nick out of two or three saucers ; or several goblets, set in a care- 
less place, have fallen and are broken. She is sick at heart, for it was but 
a few weeks before she had spent fifteen or twenty dollars to replace her 
broken, cracked, and nicked dishes. Little comfort does she get from 
Bridget, who replies: *'La, madam, it was but a few of your dishesi, and sure 
I could not help it. 1 would not think the likes of ye would make such h 
fuss." Every wise housekeeper will distinguish between carelessness and 
accidents. To correct this evil, and stop this great waste, the only way is to 
have help understand they musft replace each broken or nicked dish (for 
a nick in a dish is as bad as a break), or have the cost of them deducted from 
their wages. This will cause two very valuable results. The servant will 
become more careful, which will add much to the comfort of the mistress^ 
and will also form a habit of earefuljiess that will fit her to become a good 
housekeeper. 

There is an old and true saying, that *'a woman can throw out with a 
spoon faster than a man can throw in with a shovel.". In cooking meats, for 
instance, unless watched, the cook will throw out the water without letting 
it cool to take ofT the fat, or scrape the dripping-pan into the swill-pail. This 
grease is useful in many ways. Bits of meat are thrown out which would 
make good hashed meat or hash ; the flour is sifted in a wasteful manner, or 
the bread-pan left with dough sticking to it; pie-crust is left and laid by to 
sour, instead of making a few tarts for tea; cake-batter is thrown out because 
but little is left; cold puddings are considered good for nothing, when often 
they can be steamed for the next day, or, as in case of rice, made over in 
other forms; vegetables are thrown away that would warm for breakfast 
nicely ; dish-towels are thrown down where mice can destroy them ; soap is 
left in water to dissolve, or more used than is necessary ; the scrub-brush is 
left in the water, pails scorched by the stove, tubs and barrels left in the sun 
to dry and fall apart, chamber-pails allowed to rust, tins not dried, and iron- 
ware rusted; nice knives are used for cooking in the" kitchen, silver spoons 
used to scrape kettles, or forks to toast bread ; cream is allowed to mold and 
spoil, mustard to dry in the pot, and vinegai" to corrode the casters; tea, 
roasted coffee, pepper, and spices to stand open and lose their strength ; the 
molasses-jug loses tlie cork and the flies take possession; vinegar is drawn in 
a basin and allowed to stand until both basin and vinegar are spoiled ; sugar 
is spilled from the barrel, coffee from the sack, and tea from the chest ; dif- 
ferent sauces are made too sweet, and both sauce and sugar are wasted ; dried 
fruit has not been taken care of in season, and becomes wormy; the vinegar 
on pickles loses strength or leaks out, and the pickles become soft ; potatoes 
in the cellar grow, and the sprouts are not removed until they become worth- 
less; apples decay for want of looking over; pork spoils for want of salt, and 
beef because the brine wants scalding; hams become tainted or filled with 



466 THE KITCHEN, 

vermin, for want of the right protection ; dried beef becomes so hard it can*t 
be cut ; cheese molds and is eaten by mice or vermin ; bones are burnt thai 
will make soap; ashes are thrown out carelessly, endangering the premises, 
and wasting them ; servants leave a light and fire burning in the kitchen, 
when they are out all the evening ; clothes are whipped to pieces in the wind ; 
fine cambrics rubbed on the board, and laces torn in starching ; brooms are 
never hung up, and are soon spoiled ; carpets are swept with stubs hardly fit 
to scrub the kitchen, and good new brooms used for scrubbing; towels are 
used in place of holders, and good sheets to iron on, taking a fresh one every 
week; table linen is thrown carelessly down, and is eaten by mice, or put 
away damp and is mildewed ; or the fruit-stains are forgotten, and the stains 
washed in; table-cloths and napkins used as dish-wipers; mats forgotten to 
be put under hot dishes ; t«a-pot8 melted by the stove ; water forgotten in 
pitchers, and allowed to freeze in winter; slops for cows and pigs never 
saved ; china used to feed cats and dogs on ; and in many other ways a care- 
less or inexperienced housekeeper wastes, without heeding, the hard-earned 
wages of her husband. Economy counts nowhere so well as in the kitchen. 



TsA. — Keep tea in a close chest or canister. 

Bread. — Keep bread or cake in a tin box or stone jar. 

Nutmegs. — Always grate nutmegs at the blossom end first. 

Coffee. — Keep coffee by itself, and closely covered. 

Red Ants. — Scatter branches of sweet-fern where they congregate. 

Salt Fish are quickest and best freshened by soaking m sour milk. 

8tain on Spoons from boiled egg is removed by rubbing with a little salt, 
or washing in water in which potatoes have been boiled. 

To Preserve Milk. — A spoonful of grated horse-radish will keep a pan 
of milk sweet for days. 

The Taste of Fish may be removed very efibctively from steel knives and 
forks by rubbing them with fresh orange or lemon peel. * 

Corks. — When corks are too large to go into a bottle, throw them into hot 
water a few moments, and they will soften. 

Charred Casks. — Water and salt meat may be preserved pure a long time 
if put up in casks with the inside charred. 

To Keep Cutlery from Rust. — Wipe dry, and wrap^ in coarse brown 
paper. 

Tin Tea-kettles.— Kerosene oil will make tin tea-kettles as bright as new. 
Saturate a woolen rag and rub with it 

To Beat the Whites of Egos quickly, put in a pinch of salt The coolef 
the eggs, the quicker they will froth. Salt cools and also freshens them. 

Pastry. — Wash the upper crust of pie? with milk just before putting them 
in the oven, and it will be a beautiful brown. 

Corn Starch is a good substitute for eggs in cookies and doughnuts. One 
table-spoonful of the starch is equal to one egg. 

Salt will curdle new milk ; hence, in preparing milk porridge, gravies^ 
etc., the salt should not be added until the disn is prepared. 

Wire Table Ware— should never be scoured; it will remain bright if 
merely washed in clean water with a little soap added. 

To Make Meats Tender. — A spoonful of vinegar put into the water in 
which meats or fowls are boiled makes them tender. 

Oranges. — Oranges and lemons keep best wrapped in soft paper, and laid 
in a drawer. Lemons may be kept in cold water, which should be changed 
twice a week. 

Silver Polish.— To one. quart rain-water add two ounces ammonia and 



THE KITCHEN. 467 

three oaiices of precipitated chalk. Put into a bottle, keep well corked and 
shake before using. 

CsMENT FOR CHINA. — The wMt^s of two eg^ and enough quicklime to 
form a thick paste. The auicklime sliould be hnely powdered ; this makes a 
^ood cement tor mending broken china, marble, or glass-ware. 

Lemons. — Before using lemons for any purpose, always roll them awhile 
with your hand on a table. This will cause them to yield a large quantity 
of juice. 

Covering for Jars. — A good water-proof paper for covering jars used in 
preserving, etc., may be made by brushing over the paper with boiled linseed 
oil ahd suspending it over a line until dry. 

To Remove a Tight Glass Stopper. — Apply a cloth wet in hot water to 
the neck of the bottle; or wind a cord around once, and "saw" back and 
forth a few times. This will heat and expand the neck of the bottle. 

To Clean Knives. — Cut a good-sized, solid, raw potato in two; dip the 
flat surface in powdered brick-dust, and rub the knife-blades ; or, use a cork, 
or a cloth in same way. Stains and rust will disappear. 

Ground Tea. — If tea be ground like coffee, or crushed, immediately before 
hot water is poured upon it, it will yield nearly double the amount of its 
exhilarating qualities. 

To Freshen Walnuts. — When walnuts have been kept until the meat ia 
too much dried to be good, let them stand in milk and water eight hours^ 
and dry them, and they will be as fresh as when new. 

Clinkers may be removed from grates and range back, by throwing half a 
dozen broken oyster shells into the fire, when the coal is aglow, and covering 
them with fresh coal. When red-hot the clinkers become doughy and are 
easily removed. 

A Fire Kindler. — Melt together three pounds resin and a quart of tar, 
and stir in as much saw-dust and pulverized charcoal as possible, spread the 
mass on a board to cool, and break into lumps the size of a walnut. Light 
one with a match, and it burns for some time with a strong blaze. 

To Clean Silver. — "Indexical Soap" is the best thing for the purpose in 
use, not for every day, but when thorough cleaning is required. It is well, 
also, to keep it in a convenient dish, ana rub on with a bit of flannel when- 
ever a spot appears on the silver. 

To Clean Brass Kettle. — ^When much discolored, scour with soap and 
ashes, then put in a half pint vinegar and a handful of salt, put on stove, 
let come to a boil, take cloth, wash thoroughly, and rinse out with water. 
If usin^ every day, the salt and vinegar and rinsing are sufficient. 

To Soften Water. — Hard water is rendered very soft and pure, rivaling 
distilled water, by merely boiling a two-ounce vial, say, in a kettle of water. 
The carbonate of lime and many impurities will be found adhering to the 
bottle. The water boils very much quicker at the same time. 

Rust on Steel Implements or knives.— -Cover the steel with sweet-oil, 
robbing it on well. Let it remain for forty-eight hours, and then, using 
finely powdered unslaked lime, rub the steel until all the rust has disap- 
peared. 

To Preserve Lamp Chimneys from Breakivg. — Place a cloth in the bot- 
tom of a large pan, fill the pan with cold water, and place new chimney in 
it; cover the pan, and let its contents lx>il one hour: take from fire, and let 
chimney remain in the water until it is cold. 

Cement for Knife Handles. — Set handle on end, and partly fill cavity 
with powdered resin, chopped hair or tow, chalk, whiting, orquicklime; 
heat the spike of the knife and force it into its place. Equal parts of sul- 
phur, resin, and brick -dust also make an excellent cement. 

Water boiled in pilvanized iron becomes poisonous, and cold water passed 
through zinc-lined iron pipes should never be used for cooking or drinking. 
Hot water for cooking should never be taken from hot-water pipes ; take 
from cold-water pipes, and keep a supply heated for use in kettles. 



468 THE KITCHES. 

Table Covbb, to be thrown over table after it is set, is best made of calioa. 
Pink mosquito netting is handsomer, bat does not keep off dust when the 
table is set for next meal immediately after the dishes are washed — the moat 
convenient plan where the dining-room is not used for other purposes. 

Vienna Lime. — Vienna lime and alcohol give a beautiful polish to iron 
or steel. Select the soft pieces of lime, such as will be easily crushed by 
the thumb and finger, as tney.are the most free from gritty particles. Ap- 
ply with a cork, piece of soft pine wood, leather, chamois, etc. 

Hot Alum-water is the best insect-destroyer known. Put the alum into 
hot water, and let it boil till it is all dissolved ; then ajpply the solution hot 
with a brush to all cracks, closets, bedsteads, and other places where* any 
insects are found. Ants, bedbugs, cockroaches, and creeping things are killec 
by it, while it has no danger of poisoning. 

To Prevent Kustino of Tin, rub fresli lard over every part of the dish, 
and then put in a hot oven and heat it thoroughly. Thus treated, any tin- 
ware may be used in water constantly, and remain bright and free from rusv 
To clean tin or other metallic vessels which have held petroleum — hot soap 
and water. 

Cabbage Water.— Be careful that no cabbage watei is poured down the 
kitchen-sink, as the smell of it — a singularly unpleasant one — ^is so strong 
that it will penetrate all over the house, and produce the suspicion of a bad 
drain. The water in which any vegetable has been boiled, should be thrown 
away out of doors, in a distant corner of the garden, if possible. 

Pulverized Charcoal— should be kept in every house in a glass iar, 
with a wide mouth, containing a half pint. The coal should be freshly 
burned — the best is not from the hardest or the softest wood, but a me- 
dium—pulverized finely in a mortar while the coals are yet red. Cork 
tight; it is invaluable in preserving meats and poultry, and is sometimes 
even given as a remedy for indigestion. 

The Smell of Onions and other odors can be removed from kettles and 
sauce-pans. Put some wood ashes into the utensil, add boiling water, and let 
it stand a short time on the back part of the stove. Or, if you have no wood- 
ashes, use potash, soda, or concentrated lye with water, then wash in hot 
Buds. All cooking utensils in which onions, cabbage, or turnips have been 
cooked should be thus cleansed. 

Boiled Potatoes, to be at their best, should be served immediately when 
done, but if the ''men folks*' are late to dinner, take them up the moment 
they are done, wrap closely in a towel or cloth and lay them in the heater or 
some warm place, and they will suffer only a little damage. When baked or 
roasted potatoes are done, place in a cloth, and sc)ueeze gently between the 
hands and serve. They will be the mealier for it. If not ready to serve, 
roll in cloth and keep warm until wanted. 

Polishing. — Flour of emery, which is cheap and is kept at all drug-stores, 
is excellent for polishing every thing except silver. Common water-lime, 
such as is used in plastering cisterns, is an excellent material for polishing 
knives, forks, and tin-ware. First rub tins with a damp cloth, then take dry 
flour and rub it on with the hands, and afterward take an old newspaper and 
rub the tin until bright Keep in an old pepper-box, and apply with a damp 
cloth. 

Quick Vinegar.— Fill a jug with cider, and turn into each ^llon of cider 
a pint of molasses and a cupful of lively yeast. Have the jug full of the 
liquid, let it stand uncorked back of the cook-stove where it will keep warm. 
It will commence fermenting in twenty-four hours, and will not take over a 
week to make splendid sharp vinegar. It must be drawn off into another 
jug. leaving the dregs, and kept in a tight-corked jug or bottles, wliere i^ 
will not freeze. 

To Wash Preserve Jars.- Preserve jars or bottles should be carefully 
washed as soon as emptied, taking care that the stoppers and covers have 
their share of attention. It is well to put soda or ammonia into the jars or 



THE KITCHEN. 469 

1>ottIes, fill lip with water, and let stand an hour, putting the stoppers or 
covers into a bowl to soak in the same way. Then pour out and scald nicely, 
but not with boiling water, as that cracks the polished 8urface inside, wipe 
dry, set in the sun or wind to air, and then set away carefully. t 

UOFFEE Syrcp. — Take half a pound of the best ground coffee; put it into 
a sauce-pan containing three pints of water, and ooil it down to one pint: 
boil the liquor, put it into another sauce-pan, well scoured, and boil it asain. 
As it boils add white sugpar enough to give the consistency of syrup; take it 
from the fire, and when it is cool put in a bottle and seal. When traveling, 
if you wish for a cup of good coffee put two tea-spoons of the syrup into an 
orainary cup, and pour ooiling water upon it, and it is ready to use. 

Rhubarb Vinegar. — For ten gallons, take twenty-five ordinary sized stalks 
of rhubarb, pound or crush with a piece of wood in the bottom of a strong; 
tub, add ten gallons water; let stand twenty-four hours; strain off the 
crushed rhubarb, and add eighteen pounds of sugar free from molasses, and 
a teacup best brewer's yeast; raise the temperature to 65 or 68°, and put the 
compound into a twelve*gallon cask ; place it in a position where the temper- 
ature will not fall below 60°. In a month strain it off from the grounds, re- 
taming it to the cask again, and let it stand till it becomes vincjgar 

Washing Dishes. — In washing dishes, in addition to directions given in 
** Dining Room," care must be taken not to put tumblers which have had 
milk in them into hot water, as it drives the milk into the ^lass, whence it 
can never be removed. They should be first rinsed well in tepid water. 
Tumblers and goblets shoula be placed in hot soapy water, dipping the 
sides first, and turning them rapidly, thus heating the outside and inside at 
the same time and preventing breaking ; when wiped, they should not be 
turned down until put away in a china closet. 

To Keep Table Cloths clean— for a long time. After clearing the table, 
place a clean towel under any spots that may have been made during dinner, 
and rub the spot with a fresh clean cloth wet with clean soap-suds, then 
rinse with clean water, dry with a clean dry towel, fold and lay under a 
heavy weight. In changing table cloths during the week, contrive to bring 
the fresh table cloth on first at dinner. Place a large napkin over each end 
of table cloth, to protect it from soiling in the process of serving the plates, 
removing when the crumbs are brushed. 

Waehbivover Coffee. — Save all that is left each meal, drain it off into a jar 
or earthen vessel, and when there is enough for a single meal, turn it into 
the coffee pot, beat an e^ thoroughly and stir well into it on the stove, and 
let it just come to boiling, then take it oft, pour in half a tea-cup of cold 
water, and if your coffee was good when first made, it will be just as good 
the second time. 

When a lar^ ouantity of coffee has been made for a party, the grounds 
should be drainea and put away in a stone jar; make conee as usual except 
using double the quantity. It will keep good for weeks. 

To Clean Coffee or Tea-pots. — Musty coffee-pots and tea-pots may be 
cleaned and sweetened by putting a good quantity of wood ashes into them 
and filling up with cold water. Set on the stove to heat gradually till the- 
water boils. Let it boil a short time, then set aside to cool, when the inside 
should be faithfully wasiied and scrubbed in hot .soap-suds, using a small 
brush that every spot may be reached ; then scald two or three times, and 
wipe till well dried. Pots and pans or plates that have been used for baking 
and grown rancid, may be cleansed In the same way. Put the plates into a 
pan with wood ashes and cold water, and proceed as above stated. If no 
wood ashes can be had, take soda. Pie-plates and baking-dishes cleaned after 
this fashion will keep sweet all the time. 

Beans for Winter. — String fresh green beans, and cut down the sides till 
within an inch of the end, boil in water fifteen minutes, take out and drain; 
when cold, pack in a stone jar, first putting two table-spoons of salt in the bot> 
to'a, then a quart of beans, sprinkle with a table-spoon of salt, put in layer 



470 THE KITCHEN. 

after layer in this way till the crock is full, pour over a pint (if not filled 
the first time, beans may be added until filled, putting in no more water 
after tliis pint) of cold well-water, put on a cloth with a plate and weight, 
»et awav in a cool place, and in about a week take off the cloth, wash it out 
in a little salt water (there will be a scum upon it), put back as before, and 
reneat operation at the end of another week; then pack away, and when 
wanted tor use, take out the quantity wanted and soak for lialf an hour, 
put in pot in cold water with a juece of fresh pork, cook half an Iiour, 
jBeason with pepper and a little salt if needed; or cook without pork, and 
season with butter and pepper. 

Soldering Liquid. — In soldering tin-ware, especially in mending old ware, 
the use of soldering liquids will greatly help. Tliere are several of these. 
Tlie best is made as follows: Get any convenient vial about half full of niii- 
riati(*acid; procure at the tin-shop some scrai^ of sheet zinc; if you have 
no strong shears, let the tinsmith cut the zinc into strips narrow enough to 
enter the vial. Place the vial out-doors, or under a shed, and add a stnp or 
two of zinc. A great bubbling or boiling will take place as the zinc dis- 
solves. As one piece of zinc dissolves add another, and w^hen a piece re- 
mains without any action or bubbling of the liquid, it is done. Fit to the 
lower end of the cork a piece of stick to reach into the liquid; after the 
liquid is perfectly quiet, cork it. In soldering, wet the j)lace where the sol- 
der is to go, with this li(juid; the drop or two that the stick will take up is 
enough. Do not get this liquid on tlie clothing, or on the skin, as it may 
irritate it and make it feel very rough. 

HoRSFORD Biscuit. — One quart flour, pint sweet milk, half toa-cup lard, 
heaping 8alt-sj)Oon salt. Measure each or Horsford's Prei)aration, mixed in 
flour, and sifted twice through a sieve. Divide the flour in halves, add the 
salt; with one hand pour in the milk on the half of the flour, with the other 
mix to a thin paste, then add the lard and the rest of the flour, mixing it 
lightly. The dough will he soft, but can be rolled on a well-floured board, 
and ciit with a common biscuit-cutter, then prick, and bake twenty minutes 
in a quick oven. Make crust as above (u.sing two-thirds cup lard or butter 
instead of half-cup) for chicken-pie with oysters (see recipe in poultry); it Is 
enough for a four-quart pan, whore the sides only are lined. Some prefer 
not to cook the oysters, only boil and skim liquor, adding oysters raw. Re- 
serve pint or pint and a half chicken-liquor ^do not mix the oyster-licjuor 
with that in the pot, but pour it in the pie by itself ) in the kettle, place it on 
tne stove, rub together table-spoon butter, two of flour, season very highly 
with pepper, stir it in the boiling chicken-liquor, salt to taste, cook until 
there is no raw taste to flour, serve in gravy-boat as dressing for pie. 

Drying Corn. — Select good ears of sweet corn, husk, take off silk care- 
fully, but do not wash; shave with a sharp knife, not too close to the 
cob, into a large tin pan or wooden bowl, scrape cob to get all the milk 
of corn; when about three quarts are cut off, line a large dripping-pan 
"with flour-sack paper, being careful to have sides and edges covered, pour 
in corn, si)read, and put at once in moderate oven; stir frequently, and 
•leave in oven fifteen or twenty minutes. Set a table out in the sun, cover 
with a cloth, pour the corn upon it, and spread out evenly and thinly. 
Before sunset nring the corn in and spread on a table in the house; in 
the morning, heat again in oven, and spread in sun as before. If direc- 
tions are closely followed, the corn will be thoroughly dried on the even- 
ing of the second day, and when shaken will rattle; store in paper bag as 
soon as cooled. Prepare in small quantities, because it must not stand 
lon^ after being shaven, but should at once go into oven to heat When 
all is dried, put in oven for final heating; place to cool, pour into the bag, 
tie closely, and hang in a cool, dry, dark place. 

Dish Cloths, Wipers, Table Linens, etc — Roller towels for the hands 
should be marked with the number of each, and also with the whole num- 
ber; as 1-6, 2-6, etc., where the whole number is six. This shows at once 



THE KITCHEN. 471 

the whole n amber to be acoonnted for, and also makes it easy to use them 
in rotation, so that they may be worn equally. Of dish cloths, of \vhich 
there should be six — two for the best dishes, two for greasy, and two for pots 
and kettles, the first two may be marked, "B-1-2 *' and "'B-2-2;" the second 
two, " G-1-2 " and *' G-2-2 ; " the third, " P-1-2 " and P-2-2." Wiping towels, 
of which there should be six, two to be used each week, washing every dav, 
may be marked in a similar way, which is equally good for napkins, table 
cloths, cloths for silver, etc. Never buy new cloth for dish cloths or wipers; 
buy Stevens' crash (or any other line* crash) for towels; when worn soft, 
take for dish-cloths and wipers ; keep whoje for dish wipers, and cut one 
of a yard in length into three, hem and place in kitchen for dish-cloths; jrou 
thus have one for pots and kettles, one for dishes, and one to wipe a kniff\ 
fork or spoon that you may be using while cooking, for the wipers should 
never be used for this purpose. 

How TO KiNDLB A CoAL FiRB. — Hard coal will not imite until it is 
thoroughly heated through and through, and as small coal will not require 
as much wood to heat it up as large, it is important, where the supply of 
kindling wood is limited, that the pieces of coal which touch the wood 
should be small. As wood in cities is more expensive than coal, economy 
suggests the use of as little as practicable. The coal, then, for kindling, 
should not only be as small as a pigeon's egg, called " chestnut coal " by the 
dealers, but to economize the wood, the pieces should not be over four inches 
long, so that they can be laid compactly, and the heat more concentrated 
on a given point of coal, and thus tne sooner heat it through. If the wood 
is thus placed, and is covered with one layer of chestnut coal, it will redden 
with great rapidity and certainty. Now cover the reddened coal with 
another layer or two, and in a minute or two put on the larger size. Put a 
handful of shavings or paper in a grate compactly, then some splinters of 
dry wood, not larger than the little finger, and outside of that a layer of 
pieces an inch or more thick and three or four long ; apply a match to the 
paper, and while it is catching put on small coal as above, and there will 
not be a failure during the winter, nor a growl in the household, for the 
want of a good and timely fire. To lessen a coal fire, press it from the top, 
so as to make the mass more compact, giving less room for air. To revive 
it, lay on small pieces tenderly ; put on the blower, and when red, add larger 
pieces, and riddle out from below. Heaping on more coal, or letting out 
the ashes below, will certaily put out a low coal fire. 

Saubb Kraut. — Slice cabbage fine on a slaw-cutter; line the bottom and 
sides of an oaken barrel or keg with cabbage leaves, put in a layer of the 
sliced cabbage about six inches in depth, sprinkle lightly with salt, and 
pound with a wooden beetle until the cabbage is a compact mass; add 
another layer of cabbage, etc., repeating the operation, pounding well each 
layer, until the barrel is full to within six inches of the top; cover with 
leaves, then a cloth, next a board cut to fit loosely on the inside of bar- 
rel, kept well down with a heavy weight. If the brine has not raised 
within two days, add .enough water, with just salt enough to taste, to 
cover the cabbage; examine every two days, and add water as before, until 
brine raises and scum forms, when lift otf cloth carefully so that the scum 
may adhere, wash well in several cold waters, wring dry and replace, re- 
peating this operation as the scum arises, at first every other day, and then 
once a week, until the aceteous fermentation ceases, which will take from 
three to six weeks. Up to this time keep warm in the kitchen, then re- 
move to a dry, cool cellar, unless made early in the fall, when it may be 
at once set in the pantry or cellar. One pint of salt to a full barrel of 
cabbage is a good proportion; some also sprinkle in whole black pepper. 
Or, to keep until summer: In April squeeze out of brine, and pack tightly 
with the hands, in a stone iar, with the bottom lightly sprinkled with salt; 
make brine enough to well cover the kraut in the pVo(>ortion of a table- 
spoon salt to a ouart of water; boil, skim, cool, and pour over; cover with 



472 



THE KITCHEN, 



cloth, then a plate, weight, and another cloth tied closely down; keep in 
a cool place, and it will be good in June. Neither i)ound nor salt the 
cabbage too much, watch closely, and keep clear from scum for good sauer 
kraut. 

Hulled Corn. — This old-fashioned luxury is really a delicious dish when 
properly prepared. Take a six-quart j)ail full of a'sbes (hanl wood ashes, 
if possible, as t bey are stronger): put them into an iron kettle with three 
cailons of water; let thenx boil alH)ut five minutes, then set off from the 
nre, and turn in a pint of cold watfcr to settle it. Tbe water should then 
feel a little slipj>ery. Turn olf the lye and strain; put it .into an iron 
kettle, and put in six quarts of shelle<l corn ; put it over a brisk fire, and 
let it boil balf an hour, skimming and stirring frequent!}' (the outside 
akin of the kernels will then slip off); strain on the lye, and rinse thor- 
oughly in several clear waters. Wben the lye is thus weakened, turn the 
corn into a large dish-nan, and turn in water enough to cover it; then 
rub thoroughly with the hands, till the black chits come off; rinse and 
strain off till the water looks clear; then put back into a clean kettle, 
with water enough to cover it, and let it boil; then turn off water, put 
on again, and parboil three or four times (it will swell to about douole 
the first quantity); the last time boil till quite soft; it may be necessary 
to add water occasionally; stir often, so as not to burn at the bottom of 
the kettle; when quite soft, put in two large table-sjHx>ns of sidt, and stir 
well; to be eaten with milk, or butter and sugar. It is a wliolesome dish, 
and although there is tn)uble in preparing it, yet it is good enough to 
pay for the labor and trouble. It is good either hot or cold, and was 
considered by our grandparents to be one of the greatest luxuries of the 
table. Wheat hulled in the same way is considered a great delicacy'', and 
a very beneficial diet for invalids, but is not so staple or nutritious as 
Indian corn. Smaller quantities can be prepared by using less lye and 
corn. 

"Water. — Pure water is as necessary to health as pure air. Rain-water, 
filtered to remove any foreign matters caught from the roof or in the smoky . 
atmosphere, is tlic purest attainable. It i.sa debatable question whether the 
mineral mattern lield in solution in hard w^ater are injurious to health, but 
vegetable or animal matters are agreed by all chemists to be iniurious, and, 
in many cases, rank poisons, breeding fatal fevers, and other violent diseases. 
"Water that is at all doubtful, should be boiled before drinking, as the vege- 
table and animal matter:: are thus destroyed, and the mineral deposited on 
the bottom of the kettle. Wells, even "in the country, are very doubtful 
sources from which to i>rocure a supply of pure water. In cities the sources 
of well-supply are almost invariably poisoned by the numerous cesspools, 
vaults ana drains that filter througn the earth until they reach the under- 
ground streams of water, poisoning them as surely as they would a surface 
stream or pond. When it is remembered that all water in wells must come 
first from the surface, and that it dissolves all sorts of filth as it passes 
Into the earth, carrying a j^ood deal with it, particularly if the soil is sandy 
and porous, it will be readily understood that wells are apt to furnish impure 
water. People who throw dirty water or other slops near a well, poison the 
wat<»r as surely as if they .scattered arsenic. Wells should be covered to ex- 
clude all leaves and vegetable matter. Tbe ground should slope away from 
the well so as to carry away surface water, and it sbould l>e located as far as 
possible from barns and out-buildings where filtb accumulates. There are 
various good filters in the market, but one may be easily and cheaply made 
as follows: Take a large flower pot, and insert a sponge in the hoie in the 
bottom, fill the pot with alternate layers of sand, charcoal, and small peb- 
bles. The flower pot thus filled up may then be placed on a jar or other 
convenient vessel, into which the water can be received as it filters through. 
Kever use hot water drawn from a lead pipe, but take the cold and heat it on 
the stove. 



THE KITCHEN. 473 

How TO USE Coal EroxoMiCALLY. — The " Scientific American'' says: There 
Is a ^eat want of intelligence regarding the burning of coal, and it is not to 
be expected that servants should know how to save it. The grate or ran^e 
is stuned so full that the oven-top is loaded with it, so the fire will not die 
out or need looking after ; then the draft is opened, and the money, or what 
is the same, the heat, goes flying up tfie chimney. With a little forethought 
all this could be prevented, and a ton of coal made to last three months 
instead of one. A good bright lire am be stea<]ily maintained with coal, 
with less trouble than with any other kind of fuel, but not by raking, 
poking, and piling in green fuel continually. 

After breaKfast the fire should be cleared of ashes, if there are any, and 
fresh fuel put on to fill the grate moderately. Let the oven damper be 
turned up so as to heat it, and leave the small top door open, more or less, 
according to the intensity of heat required. In this way air entera over the 
top of tiie fire, and maintains a far better combustion, and consequently 
greater heat than when the draft-dampers are thrown down. A wiishing 
can be done, or "ironing" accomplished, with one-third less coal than is 
generally thought necessary to use. 

There is also great waste in throwing away half-burned coal under the 
supposition that it is cinders. One who has experimented with coal for 
twenty years, both in the house and under the boiler, writes; 

In cleaning the grate in the morning, you will find there is a quantity 
of unburned coal, which has been externally subjected to combustion. It 
is covered with ashes, and look.s to the inexperienced eye like cinder. It is 
often relentlesslj' dumped into the ash-box. The fact, in many cases^ is, 
that the lump is only roasted on the outside, not even coked, and is in a 
better condition for igniting than the fresh coal. We have stated that coal 
is a condensed form or carbon. The superficially burned lumps, found in 
our grates or among our ashes, sufficiently prove this. But take a lump of 
anthracite coal from the fire, red-hot and all alive, throw it into the water 
until the ashes are washed from it, and it is black externally and cool. Take 
it out, and break it open with a hammer, and j'ou will find it red-hot and 
glowing inside. This shows that time, and a plentiful supply of air, are 
necessary to burn coal, and that large amounts of what we call ashes and 
cinders are really excellent fuel. 

To prove this fact, let any one carefully sift his ashes, throwing out the 
inevitable slate, which can be readily detected, and start his coal-fire on 
wood or charcoal, kindling his coal-fire with the savings. He will find that 
he can get a good bed of incandescent coal sooner than with green coal on 
the kindlings. 

Never, whether rich or poor, suffer cinders or unburned bits of coal to be 
wasted in the ash-barrel. Measure for measure, they are worth more than 
coal. Save them, soak them, try them. Water vonovates the coke, and 
wet cinders upon a hot coal-fire will make it hotter, and keep it so longer 
than fresh coal. Saving cinders is not meanness, it is economy. 

Flavoring Extracts, Fruit-juices, Etc — The following directions for 
the preparation at home of extracts, etc., are contributed by a trustworthy 
and experienced dealer, and may be relied upon. Of flavoring extracts put 
up for the general market, almond and peach are seldom pure, and are 
sometimes even poisonous. The other kinds are less liable to be adulterated. 
To prepare vanilla, take one ounce of fresh vanilla beans, cut fine, and 
rub thoroughly with two. ounces granulated sugar, put in a pint bottle, and 
pour over it four ounces pure water, and ten ounces of ninety-five per cent, 
aeodorized alcohol. Set in a warm place, and shake occasionally for four- 
teen days. 

To prepare lemon, cut in small pieces the rinds of two lemons, put in a 
four-ounce bottle, and fill with deodorized strong alcohol, set in a warm 

Slace for a week ; then put two drams fresh oil of lemon, four ounces of 
eodorized strong alcohol, and tlie Juice of half a lemon, in a bottle of sui* 
£cient size to hold all ; then strain m the tincture of lemon peel. 

30 



474 THE KITCUES, 

To make orange extract, use the rind and oil of orange, as directed for 
lemon. 

To make rose extract, put one ounce of red rose leaves in one pint of de- 
odorized alcohol, let stand eight days; press out the liquid from the leaves, 
and add it to a half drum of otto of rosei;. 

Oils must be fresh and pure, or the extract will have a turj^entine taste ; 
and always use deodorized alcohol. 

For fruit juices, select clean, ripje fruit, press out juice, and strain it 
through flannel; to each pint of juice, ada six ounces pure granulated 
sugar; put in a porcelain kettle, bring to boiling point, and Bottle while iiot, 
in two or four ounce bottles. 

Canned-fruit juice luay be used in the same way. These juices are a per- 
fect substitute for brandy, wine, etc., in all puddings, and sauces, etc 

For gold coloring, take one ounce turmeric to two ounces alcohol 

To futer water and alcoholic solutions (not syrups), pass through filtering 
paper, folded in conical form, so as to set into a funnel (a half -pint glass fun- 
nel is best). The paper is kept at all drug stores. 

The New " Patent Process Flour.'* — ^In all markets the best and highest- 
priced flour is now known as the Minnesota '*New Process.*' A few years 
ago the process was invented and first used in the young city of MinneapK>lis, 
which now exports nearly a million and a quarter barrelis of flour yearly, and 
finds a market for it in every part of the United States and £urope. The 
wheat from which this fiour is made, is the hard spring wheat, raised in tha 
extreme Nortk^ that raised south of Minnesota and Dakota being inferior, and 
most of it not available for the best grades, while that raised on the line of 
the North Pacific, and in the rich valley of the Red River of the North, 
makes the very highest grades of flour. This hard wheat is first passed 
through rollers and mashed ; then to the stones, which are run at a low rate 
of speed, and so dressed that the grinding is nearly all done near the outer 
edge of the stone, the ** runner'* being set high, so as not to heat the floor, 
but to leave it in hard, sharp globules. From this stone it is conveyed to a 
series of bolts, where the bran is separated, the softer and finer particles 
being passed through and put up as lower grades of flour, known as ** All- 
Wheat Flour." The coarser particles and " middlings *' are separated by this 
process, and conveyed to the purifiers, where they are thoroughly cleaned of 
all bran and impurities ; after which, they go to the stones to be reground 
and rebolted, ana thus made into the *' New Process Flour." These miadlings 
are mainly from the outer portion of the kernel, which lies immediately below 
the flinty and worthless nusk (which goes off in bran), and is rich in the 
nutritious gluten — the nitrogenous principle of wheat which makes it rank 
first as a "force-producing" food. Before the introduction of this process, 
the stones were driven at a high rate of si>eed, and the wheat thoroughly 
ground b^ the first run through the mill, the flour coming out quite hot, and 
much of its strength lost by the heating. The comparative rate of speed may 
be known by the fact that only five bushels are ground per hour by the new 
process; while, with the old, from fifteen to eighteen would have been con- 
sumed. By the old process, the " middlings" made a second rate dark fiour; 
by ti»e new, it is transformed into the best known to the trade. 

That this flour is the most economical for use, there is no doubt among 
those who have tried it. The hard spring wheat makes a much stronger flour 
than any of the soft varieties of spring or winter wheat, because it contains 
a larger portion of gluten and less starch; and a given quantity will make 
from fifteen to twenty per cent, more loaves of bread of the same size and 
weight than the best winter wheat flour. This fact is what has given Minne- 
sota bakers' grades their popularity. Another advantage possessed by this 
fiour, especially for family use, is that bread from it does not become stale 
and dry as soon as that made from winter wheat, but retains its moisture 
and good table qualities much longer. 

The following in regard to the New Process Flour is from George H. 



KITCHEN UTESSILS. 



475 



Christian, Esq., who lias spent years in studying the best methods in use in 
this country and Europe, and* is the largest manufacturer in the United 
States : 

" In regard to the economy of the New Process Flour, made from Min- 
nesota spring wheat, it is clnime<l. and I l>elics'e ]ia.s been established, that 
the best qualities .will make forty or fifty pounds of bread to the barrel more 
than tlour from tlie best quality of winter wheat. This is explained by its 
8Ui>erio^ atiiuity lor water which, being held in that much greater quantity 
in the bread, insures its keeping moist fur a long time. Perfiaps it might 
interest the scrupulous housewife to know that the New Process Flour is 
cleaner, all of the shell or bran being taken away before this kind of Hour is 
made by the mill-stwies. The authorities give the chemical analysis as iM 
parts gfuten, 50 ^wirUs starch, 10 i>art3 dextrine, glucose, etc., 5 parts salts, 
fatty material, etc., and 15 parts water, for flour made from the best Min- 
nesota spring wheat by the new process. The above percentage of gluten is 
nearly double tliat of flour made from the soft varieties of wheat (that of 
Minnesota is of the hard). Gluten is the most im)K)rtant compound of 
flour, and is the substance which renders the dough firm, and gives it sutfl- 
cient consistency to hold the gases, generated by fermentation, long enough 
to make it rise well, and snsure a h^ht palatable bread. It is well known 
also that bread from spring wheat la sweeter. The percentage of gluten 
in New Process Flour is more than In flour made of the same wheat by the 
old process." 

KITCHEN UTENSILS. 

The following is a list of the i\tensils needed in every well -furnished 
kitchen. Of course an ingenious housewife will make fewer do excellent 
service, but all these save time and labor, and make the careful preparation 
of food easier. In buying tinware and kitchen utensils generally, it is econ- 
omy to purchase the best at first. The very best double plate tinware will 
last a lifetime, while the poor cheap kiud will not last a year. The low- 
priced earthenware, particularly that which looks like the substance of a 
common brick when broken, is worthless. The solid, strong stoneware costs 
perhaps a quarter more, but it is worth ten times as much as the other. It 
is also much better for milk than tin.

KITCHEN LUXURIES. 
Of course there are many things to be considered in bnying a kitchen 
ontfit. The size of the family for which the cooking is to be done, the size 
of the kitchen itself, and the amount ot cupboard room, and most of all 
the purse. It will often be easier to do work with fewer utensils than to 
have more than there is room to put away in proper order, and an ingenious 
or thoughtful housekeeper will often manage to make one utensil do the 
work of three or four as used in more liberally supplied kitchens. ''Cii^ 
cumstances alter cases** in supplying kitchens, as well as elsewhere. 



KITCHEN LUXURIES. 

The ntensila listed oil previous pages are moat of tliem necessities in ony 
well-regulated kitchen, but there nre luwiy other" articles that either save 
labor or do the work better tbu» it can be done without their aid. We give 
a few of these, with illustrations that will explain them more fully tlian is 
possible by the simple text. 

Spiral Eoo BKATEJU^Tbis 1b a very useJul imple-

the " Dover," a cut of which appears elsewhere. 
The Bjiiral beater does the work well, but not so 
easily or quickly as the more costly machine. 

Tea-Kkttlb Boi LBK.— It is often convenient to util- 
ize the heat of the tea-kettle for cooking, and a tea-kettle boiler does It to 
perfection. It is Biniply a long, tapering tin dish, with a long handle, large 
enough to Iill tlie opening and long enough to reach within half an inch 
of the bottom. It may have a cover iff its own or the cover of tlie lea-ket- 
tle mav be used. It can be made by any tinner at a small cost, and is just 
the thing for cooking gruels, custards, etc., and serves as a steamer for pud- 
dings, brown bread, etc., for a small family. 

Umbbella Foldiwo Rack.— This verf 
neat and simple contrivance is a great 
convenience il placed on the wall near 
the kitchen stove. When in use it pre- 
sents a goodly numlwrof arms on which 
to hang articles to be dried, and when 
not in use it closes up modestly and oc- 
cupies no useful space. We know of 
nothing BO jUmple and useful for the 
pnr)iose. It is made in the very best 
manner, and with fair ufiagc will laet a

jected t<) great heat without danper of buriiinu'. A Slmut is arranged to 
catch all the juices as they flow, ond ctirrit-s them to a little |>an provided 
for the purpose. Great care must be (akin not to remove a cover or open 
the stove door while the broiling b going on, or the smoke will rush vp 
into the broiler. With care to avoid this, not a particle of smoke reaches

sity in every kitchen. It is used for grating

A COI.AIJDBB in the form given in

prime necessity in every kitchen. 
Every skillful housewife will be 
quick to see the advantages of this

This form is made for service, and will last a long tiiiie. 

Spice Race. — The cut represents a 
neat rack in which is set small cans

again. 

Spick Cabinet. — A little bureau, abont 
a foot high, with each drawer labeled

two dollars, and is a great convenience. 

Spice Box.— The spice boa serves the same 
purpose as the mck and cabinet, but is 
closer than either and equally convenient, 
it has a handle on the top and a clasp 
which fastens the lid in place. For keeping 
spices from waste, and for convenience, one 
of these contrivances is a great addition to 
a kitchen outfit. 

A PAIR OF <iOoi> RCAiJts is a necessity in

KIIVUEH LUXURIES. 491 

" O VBTER- B LOCKS. "~T ilia ia the iiame of the new ice-sets for serving raw 
oysters at fashionable dinners and suppers. There is, first, a tin box. Into 
this is set a larjje square slab of pertecMy pare, clear ice. Around the boi, 
and concealinj^ its edfie, is beautifully arranged, handsome sea-weed of the 
least jagged kind. Wlien tlie lime comes for serving the raw oysters they 
are laid upon the slab of ice, on which they must not remain long enough 
to freeze — in a room of average leiiiperalure this will not happen— and then 
they are served. " Utile Neck" clams are served in the same way. and a 
fancy having demanded the small crabs that are frequently served with oys- 
ters, these are thus brought to tahle also. 

Lid Ij»tkks. — There are a great many forms of 
lifters for siove lids. The two beat we ilhi.simtf 
heri>. In one the handle is of wood, set in an 
1 socket, n I id ill "' '" '"' 



and has a linok for lifting puts and kettles, which

m.—ln cities where gas is used the 

use of jcas stoves for cooking in hot weather Is as 
a rule economical, and adils much to comfort, or rather saves much discom- 
fort. Uas companies usually make a discount for gas consumed in cooking. 
There are many gas stoves in market, any of them eicellent for the 
purpose. 

Ply Trap.— In spite of carefully screened windows, flies 
will make their way into the best kept houses. The trap 
represented here is tlie invention of a lady, and is a per- 
fect success. It will clear a room of flies in a short time, 
if none are allowed to get in fromoutof doors. The tlies 
are attracted insi<le the cage by bait and can't get out, 
and are easily killed and trap set for more. 

KiTc-HF.s WisnowB — Ought to be as cheerful, light and 
bright OS any room in the house. If the sills are extra 
liniad, and a few* choice Howers thrive on them, so much 
the better. The ceilings should be of a cheerful tint, and 
the wood-work, whether oiled or [minted, vamiihtd. This 
protects the wood nud paint, and it iseu-sily cleaned. It i- 
a mistaken idea to neglect the kitchen for the parlor. 



. _ a little liall Is formed, with a pretty n. . 

jurface. These niay be piled on the butter dish, 

or served on individual butter dishes at the plates. 

A Gr.itk Heatkh. — One of the latest cheap conveniences is a neat iron 

Elate, large enough to set a coffee or teapot on. which has appendages be- 
iw which slip over the front bars of a grate, and furnish a place to heat 
cofTee. tea or water by the grate fire. This heater may be ollucbed so as to 
project inside over the fire, or outside when the heat would be less intense. 

A Table He.iteb.— Another ingenious heater Is a round piece of solid 
Iron, as large as the bottom of a coffee-pot This Is placed on the top of 
the stove and heated, and when the cotiee-pot is placed on the table this 
heater, set in a neat cast-iron bnsltet, supported on three neat Ipct. takes 
the place of a table mat and kee|w it steaming hot, as the iron holds heat 
for . lung time. The baNkei is constructed so that air circulates under the 
Wti and prevents injury to table. 



HOUSEHOLD OONVENIENOES. 

There are many inventions, not costly, that are very useful, which do oot 
belong to the kitchen, a few of which are n^entioned below : 

BBt;HH akdComb R.vck.— a very neat 
white wire rack, for hoMioBthe hairbrush 
and comb, vrliich usually lie in the wny in 

the vicinity of the mirror, may now be i 

liud for a few edits, and is a great con- 
vi-nience for the toilet. 

Chbap Toilet Table.— When a wash 
stand can not be afTorded, procure a large 
three-cornered piece of board, large 
«nough to comfortably aceommodate a 
wash l>owl, pitcher, eta., and fasten it in 

a comer of [be room where the light iHBOod. Cover it suitably with col- 
ored cambric, tack on the edge a BliRhtly full flounce of the same, long 
enough to reach the Hoor, Over this place plain book muslin with box 
pleatinga across the edge and along the bottom. The frame of the mirror 
over it may also be draped with book muslin. Neat paper lioies, covered 
with fancy pa(*r or zephyr work niav he added for holding hriiafaes, 
comtB. eli^ A neat drawer may easily be fitted under the hoam, and will 
be found convenient for many purposes. 

Bbubh STANn. — Another toilet convenience is 
a white wire stand for hand and tooth hruBhes. 
It is so contrived that the bruslies are kept in 
place and yet are always within easy and con- 
venient reach. The stand is not expensive, and 
is ornamental as well as useful. 

A HoMBMADB LousoE.— A long packing boi, 
Bucli as may be had for a trifle at almost anv 
dry goods store, of the right height, lined with 
wall-'i-iapcr, the cover put on with hinges, and 
if of more th:<n one Ixurd strengthenetl by 
cleats on the under side, and the whole neatly 
cnshioned and covered with tastefully selected 
calico, makcH a very pretty lounge, and may 
be used also for a receptacle of the best dresses. 
When more than one dress is to he stored in 
It, and it is important to avoiil crtishine. a thin 
board resting on strips nailed on the ends inside 
half way up divides the box into two equal 

Place the dress least iiseil in hottom, drop the dividing board 
•i luir in uHlcf namienls more commonly •"•^ v,.i».,no in. 
oo close |)acking and mui 

represents a very good 
form of smoothing iron. The pccutinr form of the 
handle makes it convenient and easy to the hand, 
while the widtli of the guard wards olF the heat more 
than in the common form. 

Lamp 8a ABES. — A Japanese para'^ol. with the handle 
removed, and a hole cut in the center to admit the 
chimney, makes a pretty lamp shade. This is not es- 
peciallv new, hut is effective always. The ribs of the 
parasol are finished with tassels of tutted crewels.

HOUSEHOLD CONVENIENCES. 

Sfohob Basket. — A sponge, especially 
Vben daiup, ie a nuisance. If hung up it 
uiuisieiis the wall, and i[ laid down it gets 
in every hody's way and ^thets dirt. The 
Bimple, neat and cheap wire basket which 
hani^ oil Ibc wall is a good receptacle for it, 
or a three-curl lered piece of oil-clotli, suit- 
taiued by a Mrinjt fastened nt each corner, 
ia a good makeshift fur the same purpose.

A PoLisHiKC iBON.— Many houHcwives wonder why 

' they can not give to shirt collars, liosonis, and cuflB the 

fine glossy surtace tlial tlie laundress puta on. This 

iwliah is due not ao much to any preparation of the 

starch as vigorous rubbing with an iron made for the 

> purpose and shaped like the one in the cut It is 
somewhat like a common Hat-iron, but has no sharp 
comers or edges, and has a brightly-polished steel face. 
After the bosom or collar lias been starched and ironed 
a damp cloth is paaseri over them and then tlie polisher

Window Hook.— It is often 
difHcuit to' find or contrive ft 
hook on whii^h to fasten th« 
bird-cage or a hanging haakel, 
which needs to be hung oppo-

without marring the casing. The 
cut reprcKcnts a neat hook which 
is perfectly ^apted to the pur- 
pose. The'lwonpperarmsendin 
rings through which screws paaa 
into the upper, edge of the window casing, while tiie end of the third ami 
Bimply rests against the front of the casing. It is firm enough to sustain 
any ordinary weight. 

A Safe and RemerRR.— It sometimes 
hapjiens that houses are so planned that 
a stove-pipe passes through the floor to 
the room in second story before passing 
into llie cliininey, a drum being used for 
heating the up-slairs room. The illustra- 
tion represents the upper end of a safe 
and register tlirough which the pipe 
passes. Tlie length of the sate is e^nal 
to the width of the joists plus the thick- 
ness of the floor and the lath and plas- 
tering. The space between the two walls 
(tin or Russia iron) of the safe is three 
inclies; they are connected toother be- 
low by a perforated cast-iron circle, and 
aijove by the tin'le shown in cut, which 
is fitted with a sliding circle which opens 
or closes the apertures. When open, tha 
warm air from the room below rushes up to the upper room ; when closed 
It is simply a perfect safe, the large air apace between the walls being per-

Scli.tt«.— This U giKxl work for children. Take a ball 
of twine and a lar^' liei'dle. cut pieces of cloth, mua- 
liu. silk, or any thing you have, into squares about an 
inch each way. Thread these on tlie twine until you 
have covered aNiut three yards. Then cut the twine 
and fasten it well to prevent its sliiiping. and roll it 
round and round, taking long stitches tlirou^li ami

take a large pair ol scissors, and. ia^'ing the mat flat. 
cut the rough edges until tlic mat is pared tu ni^arly 
half its former thickness. It should look like a cjiild s 
worsted ball, and is the same on both sides. These 
mats were made during the war by the Sijuthem la- 
dies, and if well done are wanii and pretty. 

A Sapk Ash TIarrei,. — Many a destructive 
lire originates in carelpa.iiip.'vi in the handling 
ot ashes. They are thrown out in improper 
plains or placed in wooden receptacles, and 
a lire breaks out from s)K>ntaneous com- 
bustion or from some "unknown cause." 
A proper asli barrel is made of metal. 
shouhl be heavy enough so as not to tie

MANAGEMENT OF SERVANTS. 



"Since the war," the great problem with the Soathern matron has 
been the Hervant question. Prior to that date, though the miBtrese had manv- 
trials with inefficient, heedless, and frequently dishonest servants, yet, as the»r 
permanent training was in her hands, she, if competent herself, was likely 
to have a few, at least, very capable assistants. 

Indeed, the colored cooks and laundresses of the South were noted for their 
fikill; many of them seeming to " possess a genius" for their work. And if 
the mistress were kind and generous, she readily succeeded in attaching her 
colored dependents to herself and her interests, and had BomefaUhfid as well 
as efficient servants. 

Now at the South {as it has so long been at the North) the ** girls" are 
birds of passage, though less reliable in their migrations, often coming and 
going with the weeks instead of the seasons. The " treasure " of to-day leaves 
at the most inopportune hour to-morrow; or, if by any chance it suits her 
inclination and convenience to "stop," she henceforth becomes the mistress^ 
her employer living in daily dread of offending and losing her. Few have 
any idea of making themselves a necessity to the family, aud sharing its 
joys and sorrows — it is only so much (or so " little "} work for so much pay — 
and no bond of sympathy or attachment is permitted to spring up on either 
side. When we look at the subject in all its bearings we can not wonder 
greatly at the existing state of things, deplorable as it is. 

The fixed wages that prevail in most towns and cities offer little induce- 
ment to girls to bc^conie specially expert in their work. Among men the 
most skillful workman commands the highest salary; and realizing this, 
they fit themselves accordingly; but the superior cook, laundress, or house- 
maid (except in rare cases), gets no more wages than the "raw girl,'' who 
does not earn her board by her bungling and wasteful style of work. Until 
some change is made in this matter, it is not likely that girls (who usually 
do housework as a makeshift until they marry or find better paying employ- 
ment) will care to render themselves more competent than is actually nec- 
essary to insure their pay. A combination among ladies to grade wages and 
protect each other from dishonest, wasteful and incompetent servants would 
be a good thing for employers and employees; it would prove an incentive 
to the latter to fit themselves more carefully for their work. Certain it is 
that it requires no small amount of diplomatic talent to administer the 
household government now.

(jOO MANA GEMENT OF SER VANTS. 

are such diTenities of characten and dispositions to be dealt with ; bat a few 
points are of prime importance in engaging a new servant, and their ob- 
servance will save much after annoyance and vexation. 

She should be fully informed as to her duties, her wages, how paid, and 
what her privileges will be. If she agrees to your terms, well ; if not, let her 
go without regret. If you engage her, let her understand from the first that 
you are the mistress. Firmnesn here will save much future trouble. She 
will be able to gauge pretty accurately your powers of administration, how- 
ever obtuse she may be as to her own duties and her fitness for them. 

The mistress who can " read " character has made a long step toward suc- 
cessful management. All '^girls'' can not be treated alike ; no two, indeed^ 
in all particulars. While every good mistress will desire to show all possi- 
ble kindness to her dependents (for the true lady is ever generous to her in- 
feriors in station, however haughty to her equals), she who understands 
human nature will realize that to some "girls" special favors must be 
sparingly and wisely granted, as they destroy the usefulness of a few. 

Praise, when deserved, is a tonic to most; indeed, some seem to require it 
to keep them up to " concert pitch." Appreeiation is but the just due of every 
faithful and conscientious servant, and will be freely rendered by the wise 
mistress. 

It is difficult to teach domestics to be systematic, yet nothing is more nec- 
essary. This is especially true in the South, where one pair of hands must 
perform often what several pairs once did. The mistress herself must do the 
" head-work," and arrange the work, unless she has an unusually competent 
servant. 

How to be systematic, yet not " fussy," is a difficult lesson for some house- 
keepers, as well as " girls," to learn. The immaculate housekeeper's home 
is not always a happy one; her ** fussiness " destroys the comfort of all about 
her. The most efficient housewives do not make the most talk and parade 
about their neatness. 

It does not at all lubricate the domestic machinery to " scold " any body, 
however great the provocation may be. (Certainly, if it did the housekeep- 
er's excuse for doing so might be a valid one.) A word of reproof, after the 
irritation has passed on both sides, will do wonders sometimes, and bear 
good fruit; but to speak, if the least angered, when theofiense is committed, 
is but adding fuel to the flame already burning too brightly. A very ap- 
propriate motto for kitchen and parlor would be, " He that ruleth his spirit 
is greater than he that taketh a city." The mistress who can no^ rule her 
own temper can not rule others. • <^ 

Never permit family matters of private interest to come to the ears of the 
servant. It will take away half the annoyance of her departure to know 
that she carries nothing with her. The indiscriminate companionship of 
children and servants that is often permitted, may be productive of much 



HINTS TO SERVANTS. 501 

Larm in Reyeral wajs. Children are very communicative naturally, and a 
''tattling'*' girl can get much material from them, out of which to manu- 
facture a great deal of goesip. One girl of this class can mar the peace of 
a whole neighborhood, and make friends enemies for life. 

There are two sides to the servant question, of course, as to most others. 
Your girl has some rights you are bound to respect. She has the inalien- 
able right to cherish what religious opinions she chooses, however misguided 
they may aeem to be. Care for the comfort and neat furnishing of her room 
is what every generous mistress will cheerfully give. The servant will take 
more pride in the care of the rest of the house, if she realizes you are in- 
terested enough in her to see that she has a comfortable chamber for her 
own use. 

But, after all, it will be impossible to secure and ^tain really competent 
girls unless they can be won to attachment to the family and its interests, 
so that they will regard themselves as a part of it, with a future identified 
with its fortunes. If the house can really be made a home for the domestic, 
as well as the family, the mistress may congratulate herself in having es- 
caped the worst and most perplexing ills of the life of the American house- 
wife. In her efforts to accomplish this, she may confidently count on meet- 
ing with many cases of incompetency, stupidity, and even ingratitude; but 
the experiment is in the right direction, and if it fails of complete success 
can not be wholly without good effects. — RiUh Soj/ai^ AUcmtOf Qa, 

HINTS TO SEBYAKTB. 

Be neat in person and dress. 

Keep your hands clean and hair tidy. 

Do not waste time in gadding about and gossip. 

Be quiet, polite and respectful in your manners. 

Tell the truth always, out especially to children. 

Do not spend your money foolishly in gewgaws of dress. 

Always follow your mistress' plan of work, or explain why you do not. 

Keep your room neat and orderly, and make it as attractive as possible. 

Do not waste any thing. To waste carelessly is almost as wrong as to 
steal. 

Never tell tales out of the family, or repeat in one what you have seen in 
another. 

Never break a promise to children, and do not frighten them with stories, 
or help them to conceal wrong-doing. 

Bemember that there is nothing gained by slighting work. Doing every 
thing as well as possible always saves labor in housekeeping. 

Bemember that the best and most faithful girls command the highest 
wases, ge#the easiest and best places, and never are out of employment. 

Learn from books or from those who have had more expen''ni>e, the best 
way of doing work, and plan to do it, with as much system and few steps as 
possible. 

Don't change employers. There are trials in every place, and it is better 
to put up with them, and make them as light as possible, than to change to 
new ones. 



HINTS ABOUT MARKETING. 



Very few housekeepers understand how to select meats wisely or how to 
buy economically. Most trust the butcher, or buy at hap-hazard, with no 
clear understanding of what they want, and no consideration at all for 
economy; and yet a little knowledge of facts, with a moderate amount of 
experience and observation, will enable any one to buy both intelligenfl j 
and economically. It«s best, when possible, to buy for cash, Eeady money 
always commands the best in the market, at the lowest prices. It is also 
better to buy of the most respectable regular dealers in the neighborhood, 
than of transient and irresponsible parties. Apparent " bargains " frequently 
turn out the worst possible investments. If a dealer imposes on you, drop 
him at once. Meat should always be wiped with a dry, clean towel as soon 
as it comes from the butcher's, and in loins the pipe which runs along the 
bone should be removed, as it soon taints. Never buy bruised meat. 

When found necessary to keep meat longer than was expected, sprinkle 
pepper, either black or red, over it. It can be washed off easily when ready 
for cooking. Powdered charcoal is excellent to prevent meat from tainting. 
Meat which has been kept on ice must be cooked immediately, but it is 
much better to place meats, poultry, game, etc., by the side of, not on, ice, 
as it is the cold air, not the ice, which arrests decay. All meats except 
veal, are better when kept a few days in a cool place. 



Buying Beep, select that which is of a clear cherry-red color after a fresh 
cut lias been for a few moments exix>sed to the air. The fat should be of a 
light straw color, and the meat marbled throughout with fat. If the beef is 
immature, the color of the lean part will be pale and dull, the bones small, 
and the fat very white. High-colored, coarse-grained beef, with the fat a 
deep yellow, should be rejected. In corn-fed beef the fat is yellowish, while 
that fattened on grasses is whiter. In cow-beef the fat is also whiter than 
in ox-beef. Inferior meat from old or ill-fed animals has a coarse, skinny 
fat and a dark red lean. Ox-.beef is the sweetest and most juicy, and the 
most economical. When meat pressed by the finger rises up quickly, it is 
prime, but if the dent disappears slowly, or remains, it is inferior ir. 
quality. Any greenish tints alx>ut either fat or lean, or slipperiness of sur- 
face, indicates that the meat has been kept so long that putrefaction has b«- 
gun. and, consequently, is unfit for use, except by those persons who prefer 
what is known as a "high flavor." Tastes diner as to the choice cuts, 
and butchers cut meat differently. The tenderloin, which is t^ choicest 
piece, and is sometimes removed by itself, lies under the short ribs atid clos« 
to the backbone, and is usually rut through with the porterhouse and sir- 
loin stakes. Of these the porterhouse is generally preferred, the part near- 
est the thin bone being the sweetest. If the tenderloin is wanted, it may b* 
secured by buying an edgebone steak, the remainder of which, after the 
removal of the*^ tenderloin, is equal to the sirloin. The small porterhoaae 
(602) 



J37A2S ABOUT 31ARKETINQ. 503 

feteaks are the most economical, but in large steaks, the coarse and ton^h 
tMirts may be used for soup, or, after boiling, for hash, which, in spite of its 
Dad repute, is rchlly a very nice dish wiien well made. A round steak, 
when the leg is not'cut down too far, is sweet and juicy, the objection being 
its toughness, U) cancel which it may be chopped fine, seasoiitiu, and made 
into breakfast croquettes. There is no waste m it, and hence it is the most 
economical to buy. The interior portion of the round is the tenderest and 
best. Porterhouse is cheaper than sirloin, having less bone. Rump steak 
and round, if well poundea to make them tender, have the best flavor. The 
best beef for a la m<xle is the round; have the bone removed and trim 
off all the gristle. For corned beef, the round is also the best The roast- 
ing pieces are the .sirloin and the ribs, the lutter Ix'ing most economical at 
the family table, the bones forming an excellent basis for soup, and the meat, 
when boned and roiled up (which should be done by the butcher), and 
roasted, i)eing in good form for the carver, as it enables him to distribute 
equally the up]»er i>art with the fatter and more skinny portions. A roast 
served in this way, if c<X)ked rare, may be cookotl a second or even a third 
time. The best beef roast is (for three) about two and a half or three 
pounds of porterhouse. Two or three pounds is a great plenty for three. 
TJiere are roasts and other meats ec^ually good in the fore-quarter of beef, 
but the proiK)rtion of bone to meat is greater. 

Veal is l)est from calves not less than four nor more than six weeks old. 
If younger it is unfit for foot!, and if older the mother cow does not furnish 
enough food, and it is apt to fall away; besides, the change to ^rass diet 
changes the character of the flesh, it becoming darker and less juicy. The 
meat should be clear and Arm, and the fat white. If dark and thin, with 
tissues hanging loosely about the bono, it is not good. Veal will not kcc]) so 
long as an older meat, especially in hot or damp weather, and when going 
the fat is soft and moist, the meat flabby and spotted, and inclined to be 

Sorous like a sponge. The hind-<iuarter is the clioicest joint. It is usually 
ivided into two parts, called the *'loin'* and the "leg. When the leg is 
laise, it is divideu into two joints, and the thin end is called the *' kidney 
end," and the other the "thick en<l." From the leg is cut the ** fillet" ana 
"veal cutlets." The "knuckle of veal" is the part left after the "fillets" 
and " cutlets" are removed. Many prefer the " oreast of veal " for roasting, 
stewing, pies, etc. It may be boned so as to roll, or a large hole may be cut 
in it to make room for the stulling. The neck of veal is used for stewin'g, 
fricassee, pies, etc. Veal chops are best for frying; cutlets are more apt to be 
tough. Veal should be avoiued in summer. Though veal and iamb contain 
less nutrition, in proportion to their weight, than beef and mutton, they are 
often preferred to these latter lueats on account of the delicacy of their 
texture and flavor. 

Sweet-breads, if properly cooked, make one of the most delicate dishes 
that can be put upon the table; but some care must be takon in se- 
lecting them, as there are two kinds, and it is only one kind that is very 
good. That one is found in the throat of the calf, and when fresh aiul in 
perfection it is plump, w^hite and fat. The other, which does verv well for 
croquettes, or any dish where it may be chopped, lies below the diaphragm, 
and is really the pancreas. However the sweet-breads may be cooked, they 
should be always first soaked for three hours in cold water, which should be 
two or tlu|^ times changed; then they should be put into boiling water for 
half an ^Pir or longer, if that docs not make them firm ; then they may he 
dried iff a towel, and pressed flat by putting them between two pans or 
boards, with a pressing-iron or other weight on top. 

Mutton should be fat, and the fat clear, hard and white. Beware of buy- 
ing mutton with flabby, lean and yellow fat. An abundance of fat is a 
source of waste, but as the lean part of fat mutton is much more juicy and 
tender than any other, it should be chosen. The longer mutton is hung 
before being cooked, provided it does not become tainted, the better it is. 



504 OAME ASD POULTRY. 

If a saddle or hannch of mutton is washed with vinegar every day, and 
dried thoroughly after each washing, it will keep a gutxi while. In warm 
weather pepper and ground ginger rubbed over it will kefi> off flies. The 
leg has the least fat in projwrtion to weight, next is the shoulder. The least 
pro{K>rtion of bone is in the leg. After the butcher has cut otf all lie can be 
persuaded to remove, y<ju wilt still have to trim it freely before broiling. 
The lean of mutton is quite different from that of beef. " W'liile beef is a 
bright carnation, mutton is a deen, dark red. The hind-quarter of mutton is 
best for roasting. The ribs may l>e used for choi)S, and are the sweeter; but 
the leg chojis are the most economical, as there is much less bone, and no 
hard meat, as on the ribs. For mutton roast, choose the ^^holllde^, the sad- 
tile, or the loin or haunch. The leg should be boiled. Small rib chops are 
best k)r broiling; those cut out from the leg are generally tough. Mutton 
cutlets to bake are taken from the neck. Almost any part will do for broth. 
As much of the fat should be removefl as practicable ; then cut into small 
pieces and simmered slowly until the meat falls to pieces. Drain off and 
skim off any remaining fat, and thicken with rice or vermicelli. Mutton 
is in season at any time, but is not so gootl in autumn. 

ToNtiUE. — Beef s tongue, calf's tongue, lamb's and sheep's tongue, pig*s 
tongue, can all be procured of the butchers, and they are all preparetl iiv tne 
same way. Calf's tongue is considered best, but it is usually sold with tbe 
head; beeve's tongues are what is referred to generally when '* tongue" 
is spoken of. Lamb's tongues are very nice. In purchasnig tongues, choose 
those which are thick, firm, and have plenty of fat on the under side. 

To Select Ha.ms. — The best hams, whether corned or cured and smoked, 
are those from eight to fifteen pounds in weight, having a thin skin, solid fat, 
and a small, short, tapering leg or shank. In selecting them, run a knife 
along the lx)ne on the fleshy side: if it comes out clean the ham is good, but 
if the knife is smeared if is spoiled. Hams may be steamed, bein^ careful 
to keej) the water under the steamer boiling, and allow twenty minutes to 
the pound. When done, brown sligJitly in the oven. 

Pork. — Great care must be taken in selecting pork. If ill-fed or diseased, 
no meat is more injurious to the health. The lean must be fine-grained, and 
both fat and lean very white. The rind should be smooth and cool to the 
touch. If clammy, be sure the pork is stale, and reject it. If the fat is full 
of small kernels, it is an indication of disease. In good bacon the rind is 
thin, the fat firm, and the lean tender. Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in it 
Fresh pork should seldom be eaten, and never except in the fall and winter. 

Lamb is good at a year old, and more digestible than most immature 
meats. "Spring Lamo " is prized because unseasonable. It is much in- 
ferior to the best mutton. The meat should be light red and fat. If not too 
warm weather, it ought to be ke^t a day or two oefore cooking, but it does 
not keep well. It is stringy and indigestible if cooked too soona fter killing. 
The fore-quarter of lamb,'if not fresh, the large vein in the neck, whicn 
should be blue, will be greenish in color. If the hind-quarter is stale, the 
kidney-fat will have a slight smell. 

GAME AND POULTRY. 

To preserve game and poultry in summer, draw as soon as possible after 
they are killed, wash in several waters, have in readiness a kettle of boiling 
water, plunge them in, drawing them up and down by the legs, ^ that the 
water may pass freely through them ; do this for five minutes, arain, wipe 
dry, and hang in a cold place ; when i)erfectly cold, rub the insides and 
necks with pepper ; prepared in this way, they w411 keep two days in warm 
weather; when used wash thoroughly. Or wash well m soda-water, rinse in 
clear water, place inside several pieces of charcoal, cover with a cloth, and 
hang in a dark, cool place. The most delicate birds can be preserved in this 



GAME. AND POULTR Y. 505 

'way. If game or poultry is at all strong, let it stand for several hours in 
"water with either soda or charcoal ; the latter will sweeten them when they 
are apparently spoiled. English or French cooks, however, never wash poul- 
try or game in dressing, unless there is something to wash off. With skill- 
ful dressing, none i.s necessiiry on the score of cleanliness, and much washing 
tends to Impair the fine flavor, especially of game. In all game and poultry 
the female is the choicer. 

Sportsmen who wish to keep prairie-chickens, pheasants, or wild fowl in 
very hot weather, or to shu> long distances, should draw the bird as s(K)n as 
killed, force down the throat two or three whole peppers, tying a string 
around the throat above them, sprinkle inside a little powdered cha'flcoal, 
and fill the cavity of the body with very dry grass. Avoid green or wet 
grass, which " heats" and hastens decay. If birds are to be shipped without 
drawing, force a piece of charcoal into the vent, and tie a string closely 
around the neck, so as to exclude all air, and make a loop in string to hang 
up by. Prepared in this way, they will bear shipment for a long distance. 

Ducks. — Young ducks feel tender under the wings, and the web of the 
foot is transparent; those with thick, hard breasts are best. Tame ducks 
have yellow legs; wild ducks, reddish ones. 

Geese. — In young geese, the bills and feet are yellow and supple, and the 
skin may be easily broken ; the breast is plump, and the fat white; an old 
goose has red and hairy legs, and is unfit for the table. 

Wild Ducks, if fishy and the flavor is disliked, should be scalded for a 
few minutes in salt and water before roasting. If the flavor is very strong, 
the duck may be skinned, as the oil in the skin is the objectionable part. 
After skinning, spread with butter, and thickly dredge with flour, before 
putting in a very quick oven. 

Game. — In pheasants and quails, yellow legs and dark bills are signs of a 
young bird. They are in season in autumn. Pigeons should be fresh, fat 
and tender, and the feet pliant and smooth. In prairie-chickens, when fresh, 
the eyes are full and round, not sunken; and, if young, the breast-bone is 
soft and yields to pressure. The latter test also applies to all fowls and game 
birds. Plover, woodcock, snipe, etc., may be chosen by the same rules. 

Turkeys are in season in fall and winter, but deteriomte in the spring. 
Old turkeys have long hairs, and the flesh is purplish when it shows under 
the skin 6n lesi^s and back; when good, thry are white, plump, with full 
breast and smooth, black legs; and, if male, soft, loose spurs. The eyes 
are bright and full, and the feet are simple, when fresh. The absence of 
these signs denotes age and staleness. Hen turkeys are inferior in flavor, 
but are smaller, fatter and plumper. Full-grown turkeys are best for bon- 
ing or boiling, as tlie flesh does not tear in dres.sing. 

Chickens, when fresh, are known by full, bright eyes, pliable feet, and 
soft, moist skin. Young fowls have a tender skin, .smooth legs and conih, 
and the best have yellow legs. In old fowls, the legs are rou^h and hard. 
The top of the breast-bone of a young fowl is soft, and may be easily bent 
with the ^gers; and the feet and neck are large in proportion to thebody. 
The best pbwls are fat, plump, with skin nearly white, and the grain of 
the flesh fine. Old fowls have long, thin necks and feet, and the flesh on 
the legs and hack has a purplish shade. Fowls are always in season. 

Venison. — The choice of venison should be regulated by the fat, which, 
when the venison is young, should be thick, clear and close, while the meat 
is a reddish brown. As it always begins to taint first near the haunches, 
run a knife into that part; if tainted, a rank smell and a greenish appear- 
ance will be perceptible. It may be kept a long time, however, with careful

506 FISH. 

management and watching, by the following process: Wash it well In milk 
and water, and dry it perfectly with a cloth until there is not the least damp 
remaining; tlien dust ground penuer over every part. Tliis is a good jire- 
servative against the ny. Tiie nesh of a female deer, abort four years old, 
is the sweetest and best of venison. 

FISH. 

When fresh, the eyes of fish are full and bright, and the gills a fine clear 
red, the body stiff and the smell not unpleasant. Mackerel nuist be lately 
caught, or it is very indifferent fish, and the flavor and excellence of salmon 
dejiends entirely on its freshness. Lobsters, when freshly caught, have some 
mus<?ular action in their claws which may be excited by pressing the eyes. 
The heaviest lobsters are the best. The male is thought *o have the highest 
flavor, the fiesli is firmer, and the shell has a brighter red, and is considered 
best during the Fall and Spring ; it may be readily distinguished from the 
female, as the tail is narrower, and the two up{>crmost fins, within the tail, 
are stiff and hard; those of the female are soft, and the tail broader. The 
latter are prepared for sauces on accoimt of their coral, and are preferred 
during the summer, especially in June and July. The head is used in 
garnishing, by twisting it off after the lobster has been boiled and become 
cold. Lobsters ranging from four pounds are most delicate. If crabs are 
fresh, the eyes are bright, the joints of the legs are stiff, and the inside 
has an agreeable smell. The heaviest are the best, the light ones being 
waterj-. Scallops are not much used; when fresh, the shell closes tight; 
hard-shell clams are also closed tight when fresh. Soft-shell clams are good 
only in cold weather, and should be fresh. Oysters, if alive and healthy, 
close tight upon the knife. They are good from September to May. 

In fresh-water fish, the same signs of freshness are good tests. Of course, 
it is impossible to name all the excellent varieties, as they differ with the 
locality'. In the South is the shad, the sheep's-head, the golden mullet and 
the Spanish mackerel, in the North-west the luscious brook trout, and the 
wonderful and choice tribes that people the inland lakes. Among the best 
of the fresh-water fish, sold generally in tlie markets of the interior, are the 
Lake Superior trout and white fish, and, coming from cold waters, they keep 
best of all fresh-water fish ; the latter is the best, most delicate, and ha^ fewer 
bones, greatly resembling shad. The wall-eyed pike, bass and i)ickerel of 
the inland lakes are also excellent fish, and are shipped, packed in ice,- 
reaching market as fresh as when caught, and are sold at moderate prices. 
California salmon is also shipped in the same way, and is sold fresh in ail 
cities, with fresh cod and other choice varieties from the Atlantic coast, but 
the long distance which they must be transported makes the price high. 
The cat-fish is the staple Mississippi River fish, and is cooked in various 
ways. Lake Superior trout are the best fresh fish for baking. All fish 
which have been packed in ice should be cooked immediately after re- 
moval, as they soon grow soft and lose their flavor. Stale fish must never 
be eaten. Fresh fish should be scaled and cleaned properly on a dry table, 
and not in a pan of water. As little water should be used as is compatible 



VEGETABLES. 507 

with perfect cleanliness. When dressed, place near ice until needed, then 
remove and cook immediately. If frozen when brought from market, thaw 
in ice-cold water. Fresh cod, whiting, haddock, and shad are better for 
being salted the night before cooking them, and the muddy smell and taste 
of fresh-water fish is removed by soaking, after cleaning, in strong salt and 
water. 

Eels must be dressed as soon as possible, or they lose their sweetness ; cut 
off the head, skin them, cut them open, and scrape them free from every 
string. They are good except in the hottest summer montlis, the fat ones 
being best. A fine codfish is thick at tlie back of the neck, and is best in 
cold weather. In sturgeon, the fish should be white, the veins blue, the 
grain even and the skin tender. 

The best salt mackerel for general use are "English mess," but ** bloaters'* 
are considered nicer. In selecting always choose those which are thick On 
the belly and fat ; poor mackerel are always dry. The salt California sal- 
mon are excellent, those of a dark rich yellow being best, lb freshen, place 
with scale side up. Salmon boiled and served with egg sauce or butter 
dressing is nice. No. 1 white fish is also a favorite salt fish, and will be 
found in all markets. 

A good deal of sturgeon is put up and sold for smoked halibut. The 
skin of halibut should be white ; if dark it is more likely to be sturgeon. 
Smoked salmon should be firm and dry. Smoked white fish and trout are 
very nice, the former being a favorite in whatever way dressed. Select 
good firm whole fish. White fish is very nice broiled. Each of the above 
is better than herring. 

VEGETABLES. 

All vegetables snap crisply when fresh ; if they bend and present a wilted 
appearance, tliey are stale. If wilted, they can be partly restored by being 
sprinkled with water, and laid in a cool, dark place. 

Potatoes are good with all meats. With poultry they are best mashed. 
Sweet potatoes are most appropriate to roasts, as are onions, winter squash, 
and asparagus. 

Carrots, parsnips, turnips, greens, and cabbage are eaten with boiled meat^ 
and com, beets, pease, and beans are appropriate to either boiled or roasted 
meat. Mashed turnip is good with roasted pork and with boiled meats. 

Tomatoes are good with every kind of meat, but especially so with roasts; 
apple sauce with roast pork, and cranberry sauce with beef, fowls, veal and 
ham. 

Currant jelly is most appropriate with roast mutton and venison, 

Pickles are good with all roast meats, and capers or nasturtiums with 
boiled lamb or mutton. 

Turnips are not nutritious, being ninety per cent, water, but an excellent 
food for those who are disposed to eat too much, as they correct constipation. 

Tomatoes are generally regarded as wholesome. The medium-sized 
smooth ones are best. 

Cauliflowers are best when large, solid and creamy. When stale th# 
leaves are wilted and show dark spots. 



508 GROCERIES, 

Celery stalks sliould be white, solid and clean. Celery begins in August, 
but it is better and sweeier after frost 

E«a-PLANT should be firm but not rii)e. The large purple oral-shaped 
kind, is best. 

Mushrooms are dangerous tilings for the inexperienced to buy, and should 
be let alone. 

Pease should be Imught in pods arid should feel cool and dry. If pods are 
rusty or spotte<l, they are too oltl to be gtKxl. 

Potatoes. — Select thv)heof medium size, smooth, with small eyes. To test, 
cut off a piece of the large end ; if spotted, they are unsound. In the spring, 
when potatoes are lieginning to bprout, place u basket of them in a tub, pour 
boiling water over them ; in a moment or two take out and place in sun to 
dry (on the gra^ is a good place), and then return to cellar. If they have 
sprouted to5 much it i.s best to lirst rub them off. 

Berries. — Morning is the best time to eat fruit, and fresh fruit is then in 
tlie best condition to be eaten. When berries of any kind can be got fresh 
wjth the morning dew, fill the finest glass dish, adding a few fresh leaves, for 
a center-piece, on the breakfast tiible. Serve in saucers accompanied with 
fine white sugar (pulverized is the best and most economical for all purposes) 
and fresh croam if you have it, but never substitute .skim milk. The berries 
will be very ni^e with only sugar. There is a vast difference between fruit 
with cream'and fruit with milk. Cream is easily digested find slow to sour, 
while just tlie cmtrary is true of milk after the cream has been removed. 
Yet we have know.i people to live after* eating strawberries aud buttermilk, 
and wo have also known people to die after eating hot apple dumplings and 
cold milk. If you happen to be the fortunate possessor of a berry patch, 
let the children go out before breakfast and pick and eat. Properly trained 
children will not abuse this privilege. 

GROCERIES 

8aoo. — The small white sago, called ** pearl," is best 

Raisins sliould be bought in small quantities; small boxes are best 

Rice. — The Southern rice cooks much quicker, and is nicer than the 
Indian rice, 

Macaroni. — Good macaroni is of a yellowish color, does not break in cook- 
ing and yields four times its bulk. 

Cheese, which feels soft between the fingers, is richest and best, and should 
be kept in a box in a cool dry place. 

Corn Meal does not keep well and should be bought in small quantities. 
South the w hite meal is used, and North the yellow is the favorite. Com 
is a heat prxiucer and is a useful winter diet. 

Vinegar, which is made of wine or cider, is the best Buy a keg, or half 
barrel of it, and set it in the cellar, and then keep a supply for the casters 
in a junk bottle in the kitchen. If too strong, vinegar will "eat" pickles. 

Hard Soap should be bought in large quantit^r, and laid to harden in bars 
piled on each other. Hard soap is more economical than soft, as it is not so 
easily wasted. 

Spices and Pepper should be ground fine, and put in large-mouthed glass 
bottles, or kept in tin cans, in a dry place. Avoid bright red peppers, spices, 
and saiices. 

Starch may also be bought in large quantities at a considerable discount 
from the retail price, which, in a large family, makes a difference in the 
yearly expenses. The best starch is the most economical. 

Buckwheat Meal, Rice and Hominy should be purchased in small qnan* 
tities, and kept in covered kegs or tubs. Several of these articles are in- 
fested witli black insects, and an examination should be occasionally made 
for them. 

LARD.^Tbe best lard is made from leaf fat which adhered to the ribs and 
belly of the hog. This is known as leaf lard. Most lard is, however, mada 



GROCERIES, 509 

of both leaf fat and meat fat, the latter cut into small pieces and rendered. 
Good lard should be white, solid, and without any disagreeable smell. 

Egos. — To determine the exact age of eggs, dissolve about four ounces of 
common salt in a quart of pure water and tlien immerse the e^. If it be 
only a day or so old, it will sink to the bottom of tlie vessel, out if it bo 
three days old it will float in tlie liquid; if mure than five it comes to the 
surface, and rises above in proportion to its increased age. 

Salt must l)e kept in the dryest place that can be found. The best for 
table use is put up in boxes, but if a quantity bo purchased, it should bo 
stored in a glass jar, and closely covered. When it becomes damp in the 
salt-stands, it should be set by the fire to dry, and afterwards reduced to fino 
])owder again. 

Coffee and Tea can be bought with advantage in considerable quantitic**. 
Coffee improves by age if kept in a dry place, as it loses its rank smell and 
taste. Several cents a pound may be saved by buying a bag of coffee or half 
chest of tea. Tea loses its flavor if i>ut up in pajSer, and should be kept in 
glass or tin, shut tight. Coffee should be kept by itself, as its odor anects 
other articles. 

Arrowroot, Tapioca Sago, Pearl-barley, American Tsinoless, Maca- 
roni, Vermicelli, and Oat-meal, are all articles which help to make an 
agreeable variety, and it is just as cheap to keep a small quantity of each as 
it is to buy a large quantity of two or three articles. Eight or ten pounds 
each of these articles of food can be kept in covered jars or covered wooden 
boxes, and then they are always at hand when wanted. All of them are 
very healthful food, and help to* form many delightful dishes for dess,erts. 

StoARS. — Buy sugars for variou.s purposes as follows: 

For baked custard, mince ))ie, squash pie, fruit cake, gingerbread, most 
Indian puddings, use brown sugar. 

For all light-colored cakes, icing, floating island, blanc-mange, meringues, 
whips, use powdered sugar. 

For pudding sauce, use powdered ^r brown sugar. 

For sweetmeats, j^lly, and raspberry vinegar, u.se granulated sugar. 

Flour should be bought in small quantities, and the best is cheapest. The 
test of quality is given under bread. Flour is peculiarly sensitive to at- 
mospheric influence, hence it should never be stored in a room with sour 
liquids nor where onions or fish are kept, nor any article that taints the air 
of the room in wliich it is stored. Any smell perceptible to the sense will 
be absorbed by flour. Avoid damp cellars or lofts wliere a free circulation 
of air can not be obtained. Keep in a cool, dry, airy room, and not ex- 
posed to a freezing temperature nor to intense summer or to artificial heat 
for any length of time above 70 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit It should not 
come in contact with grain or other substances which are liable to heat. 
Flour should be sifted and the particles thoroughly disintegrated, and then 
warmed before baking. 

Dressing Poultry for Market. — Secure plump, well fattened fowls. 
Do not feed for at least 24 hours before killing. Open the veins of the neck 
and bleed freely— thi.s is the best mode of killing. Scald enough to make the 
feathers come off easily, picking both feathers and pin feathers off nicely. Be 
careful not to bruise or break the skin in any way, because it injures the 
sale. Leave all the entrails in, and head and' feet* on. Immediately after 
they lu-Q dressed, dip once in boiling hot water, letting them rernain in 
about ten seconds; tnen dip into ice-cold water, allowing them to remain in 
the same length of time, then hang in a cool place where they will dry be- 
fore packing. Ducks should he treated same as fowls or chickens. Pack in 
boxes or barrels in nice, clean rye or oat straw. Boxes holding from 100 lbs. 
to 200 lbs. are the most desirable style of packages. Pack with breasts down, 
using straw between each layer. 

Be sure to pack solid, so they will not bruise on the way. Poultry pre- 
pared in this way will meet v/ith a ready sale, while poorly dressed, sweaty

(caused by beiiiR packed while warm) and bruised lots will not sell at any 
time. Large, fat, dry picked turkeys and chickens sell well. They shoula 
be picked at once after killing, and hung up until the animal heat is entirely 
out before packing. Renienil^r, it is the appearance of goods that sells thenu 
Nice, large, fat, plump turkeys, chickens, ducks, or geese, always brin^ out- 
side prices. 

Tfte best time to ship. — Any time after the tenth of November, so as to 
reach market by Weunesday or Thursday of each week. If sent for tlie 
holidays, tliey should arrive at least threedays before Thanksgiving, Christ- 
mas or New Year's. Keep the largest turkeys for New Year's. Geese sell 
best at Christmas. 

FUEL. 

Wood. — A table showing the comparative value of various woods is griven 
with the table of weights and measures. That cut from the body of aiuaturo 
tree is best. 

Soft Coal, — ^The objection to soft coal is the dust that arises from it, and 
the unpleasant smell of the gases of combustion. There is a great difference 
in the quality of soft coals from different mines, and it will be easy to learn 
the best varieties in the local market. 

Hard Coal. — Bad coal has flat, dull pieces in it which remain hard, heavy 
and whitish when burned, called '* bone.'' If in a scuttle full of coal weigh- 
ing twenty-five pounds, a half pound of these white pieces are found, the coal 
is not good. Coal is pronounced good if it breaks at right angles firmly and 
with a bright fracture. If it shatters or is full of dull pieces, it is poor in 
ouality. There is a vast difference in hard coal, a difference which lew on- 
aerstand. 



CARVING. 

It IB no trining accomplishment to carve well, and both ladlea and gentle- 
men oaght to so far make carving a study tliat they may be able to perform 
the task with autficient sicill at ieaat to prevent remark. There are no real 
difficulties in tliB way of mastering the accomplishment; knowledge simply 
is required. .A.I1 displays of exertion are in bad taste, because they inilieate 
a want of ability on tlie purt of tlie carver, or arc a alroiig indication of tJic

jr that he lias Cull control over it; it tar off notliing can prevent an 

tingraceful appearance. In carving a turkey, place the bead lo the ''isht, cut 
off the wing nearest you firat, then the leg and second joint; then slice the 
breast until a rounded, ivory-shaped piece appears; insert the knife between 
that and the huneand separate them; this part is the nicest bit of the breast; 
neit conies the  nierry-tliought" After this, turn over the bird a little, 
and just tielow the breast you will find tlie ''oyster," which you can separata 
u you did the inner breast. The aide bone lies beside the rump, and the 
desired morsel can be taken out without separating the whole bone. Pro- 
ceed in the same waj' upon the other side. The fork need not be removed 
during the whole process. An eicperienced carver will dissect s fowl as 
msily as you can break an egg or cut a potato. He retains his seat, manages 
his handa and elbows artistically, and is perfectly at his ease. There is no 
difficulty in the matter; it only requires knowledge and practice^and these 
■hould be tiiu};Iit in the family, each child taking his turn. Chickens and 
partridges are carved in the same way. The trail of a woodcock o 



lutting a breast of veal, separate the 
u up. 

Sirloin of Bkef.— In carving, 
beef, mutton, lamb, and veal, thin, 
smooth, and neat slices are desira- 
ble — cut OTOM tbr grain, taking care 
to pasa the knife through to the 
bones of the lyeat. There are two 
modes of helping a sirloin of beet; 
either by carving long, thin slices 
from 3 to 4. and helping it with a 
bit ot the fat underneath the riba, 
or by cutting tiiicker slices, from 

SnouLDEB OF Mutton. — A shoulder 
of mutton should he cut down to the 
hone, in the direrlion of the line 1, 
and then thin slices of lean taken from 
each side. The best fat is found at 2 
and should be cut in thin slices in that 
direction. Several temptingsliceecan 
be cut on either aide of the line 3. and 
there are nice bila on the under aida 
near the flap.

CARVING, 




Ham. — A ham may be carved in 
three ways: First, by cutting long, 
delicate slices, through the thick fat 
from 1 to 2, down to the bone ; sec- 
ondly, by running the point of the 
knife in the circle in the middle, 
and cutting thin circular slices, thus 
keeping the ham moist; and last, 
and most economically, by begin- 
ning at the knuckle, 4-5, and slicing 
upward. 

Lk« of Mutton. — In carving a 
lo^ of mutton the best slices are ob- 
tained froiu the center, by cutting 
from 1 to 2; and some very good 
cuts are found on the broad end 
from 5 to 6. Some epicures prefer 
slices nearer the knuckle, but the^ 
are dry. The cramp-bone is a deli- 
cacy, and is obtained by cutting 
down to the bone at 4, ana running 
the knife under it in a semicircular direction to 3. The fat so esteemed by 
many lies on the ridge 5. By turning over the meat some excellent slices 
are found, and can be cut lengthwise. 

Tongue. — A tongue should be 
carved as " thin as a wafer ; " its deli- 
cacy depending in a great degree 
upon that. A well-cut tongue tempts 
the most fastidious; and this applies, 
in fact, to all kinds of roast and 
boiled meats. A chunk of beef we 
turn from with disgust — an artistic 
slice we enjoy. The center slices of 
the tongue are considered the best, 
and should be cut across at the line 1, and the slices taken from each side, 
with a portion of the fat which is at its root, if it is liked. I^he question 
should oe asked. 

Haunch of Venison. — A haunch 
of venison should be cut across to 
the bone on the line 1-3-2, then turn 
the dish a little, and put the point 
of the knife at 3, and cut down as 
deep as possible in the direction of 
S-4, and continue to cut slices on the 
right and left of the line. The fat- 
test parts are found between 4 and 2. A loin of veal or a loin of mutton 
should be jointed by the butcher before it is cooked, and the carver easily 
cuts through the ribs. He should serve a portion of the kidney and the fat 
on each plate. 

In serving fish, some practice is needful, for lightness of touch and dex- 
terity of management are necessary to prevent the flakes from breaking. In 
serving mackerel, shad, etc., a part of the roe should be placed on each plate. 
The fins of the turbot are the most sought for ; the fish is placed underpart 
uppermost on the platter, as there lies the primest part. In carving salmon, 
a portion of the back and belly should be served to each person. The choicest 
morsels are next to the head, the thin part comes next, and the tail is the 
least esteemed. The flavor of the fish nearest the bone is not e<jual to that 
on the upper part. 





HOW TO CUT AND CURE MEATS. 



It is often economical for a family (o buy beef by the quarter, unit 
smaller aniioala whole, eapecially when wunted for winter use, onci every 
faoQBekeeper ought to know bow to cut up meaU and to understand the 
uses and relative value of Che piecex. It 
is not difficult to out up beef, and is very 
easy to reduce any of the smaller anliuals 
to convenient proportions for domestic use ; 
and in order to make the subject clear 
we present the accompanying: engravings, 
the first of which represents (lie half of a 
beef, including, of course, the hind and 
fore-quarters. The letters indicate the 
direction in wliich the cuts should be 
made, beginning in the order of the al- 
phabet, cutting first from A tu B, then 
C to D, etc. In the fore-quarter cut from 
A to B, from B to V, from D to E, etc. 
For cutting, use a sliarp, long, and pointed 
knife, and a saw of the t)e9t steel, slmrp, 
and .wl for butelier's use. The beef siiuiild 
be laid on a bench or table with the inner 
side up. In hind quarter 1 represents the 
"rump," which is bestcornod; 2, "round," 
the under part of which makes steaks, the 
outside good corning pieces, or the whole 
moy be used fur dried beef; 3, "shank" 
for SoUjis; 4. " rump steaks ;" 5, "veiny 
piece" for dried lieef or coming; 6, sirloin, 
tlie best steak ; 7. flank for coming or 
slews; S. ]>orterhouse, the upper part of 
which Is equal to sirloin. Cut in llii.t 
' way a part of the tenderloin, the choicest 

hit of the beef, lies in the sirloin, and 
a smaller part in the upper part of the 
porterhouse steok. In (he fore-quarter I is tlie "rib piece" for lioiling or 
coming; 2, the "plate" piece for corniug; 3, the "fore-shank" for soup; 
0, the "rib roast," first cut; 6, "rib roast," best cut, and the best roast in 
the beef; 7, "chuck rib roast," commonly used for "pot roast;" 8, neck 
piece, (or coming or pie meat; 9, best cut for corn beef.

Spiced Corned Beef. — To ten pounds beef, take two cups salt, two cupa 
tnolHsses, two table-spoons saltpeter, one table-spoon ground pepper, one ta- 
ble-siK)on cloves ; rub well into the beef, turn every day, and rub the mixture 
i:i : will be ready for use in ten days. 

To Keep Hams after Curing. — Cut hams in slices suitable for cooking, 
trim off the rind, and pack as compactly as possible in a stone jar; over tl^ 
toi> pour molted lard, so as to completely exclude the air. When ham is 
wanted for use, scrai)e off the lard, remove a layer of meat, and always he 
particular to melt the lard and return it immediately to the jar. It will keep 
through the season. 

A New Way to Smoke Hams. — Smoke the barrel^ in which the hams are 
to be pickled, bv inverting it over a kettle containing a slow fire of hard 
wood, for eight days (keeping water on the head to prevent shrinking); in 
this barrel pack the hams, and pour over them, after it has cooled, a brine 
made in the profwrtion of four gallons of water, eight pounds of salt, five 
pints of molasse.«>, and four ounces saltpetre, boiled and skimmed in the 



HOW TO CUT AND CURE MEATS. 515 

usaal manner. They will be cured in eight or nine days, and they may be 
kept in the pickle for a year without damage. 

To Keep Lard from Molding. — Use a tub that has had no tainted lard 
or meat in it; scour it out thoroughly with two quarts of wheat bran to four 
of boiling water, but use no lye of soap. Fry the lard until the scraps are 
brown, but not scorched or burned ; remove from the fire, cool until it can 
be handled, and strain into the prepared tub; when cold, set it away in the 
cellar. Lard dipped off as fast tis it melts will look very white, but will not 
keep through the summer. No salt should be added, as it induces moisture 
and invites mold. 

To Keep Meat Fresh in Hot Weather. — For a five-pound piece of meat 
take a three-gallon stone crock ; have some pans of skimmed milk that is 
taming sour, just getting thick; put some of the milk in the crock; then 
put in the meat; then put in milk till it covers the meat; now turn an 
earthen dish or plate bottom-up on the meat to hold it down; fill the crock 
with the milk ; tie a cloth over the top, and set in a cool place ; it will keep 
five or six days in the hottest weather. When wanted for use, wash thor* 
oughly in water, and cook in any manner desired. 

To Keep Hams. — For one hundred ix)unds of meat, take eight pounds of 
salt, two ounces saltpetre, and four gallons water; put hams in this pickle 
in the fall, keeping them well under the brine ; in April, take out, drain three 
or four days, slice as for cooking, fry nearly as much as for table, pack in. 
stone jars, pressing down the slices as fast as they are laid in the jars; whea 
full, put on a weight, and when entirely cold cover with the fat fried out. 
Prepared in this way, they retain the ham flavor without being smoked. The 
gravy left from frying will be found verv useful in cooking. 

To Cure Hams. — In the fall, about tlie first of Novemuer, people in the 
country generally kill a ^ood-sized pig, to last until "butchering time." To 
cure the nams of such, first rub well, es])ecially around the bone on fleshy 
side, with one-half of the salt, sug^r, cavenne and salti)€tre, well pulverized 
(same proportions as for corned-beef ), adding a teasi>oon of allspice to each 
ham ; put a layer of salt in bottom of cask, and pack in hams as closely as 
possible; let stand three or four days, then make a brine of the other half 
of salt, etc., and jwur over meat, putting a good weight on top ; when it has 
lain three or four weeks it is ready for use. 

To Cure and Dry Beep Tongues. — For one dozen tongues make a brine 
of a gallon and a half of water (or enough to cover them well), two pints good 
salt, one of molasses, or one pound brown sugar, and four red peppers ; bring 
to a boil, skin, and set to cool. Pack the tongues in a large jar, and when 
the brine is entirely cold, pour it over them, put on a weignt, let remain 
ten or twelve days, take out, drain, and hang to smoke about two days, then 
dry moderately, and put away in a flour sack in a dry place. When wanted 
for use, boil six or eight hours in a pot filled with water, adding more when 
necessary so as to keep well covered all the time until done ; when done, 
take out' and set away to cool, but do not skin till needed for the table. 

Sausage. — For ten |X)unds meat take five table8j)oons sage, four of salt 
and two of pepper. Some add one tablespoon ginger, and some a little 
summer savory. When nicely minocd, pack in jars, and treat precisely as in 
preceding recipe — **To Keep Hams." If kept in a cool place, and care 
taken to replace the lard, there is no difliculty in keeping sausage perfectly 
fresh almost any length of time. Some persons partially cook meat before 
packing, but this is not necessary. Fresh meat may be kept nicely in the 
same way, being first seasoned with salt and ))e))per. 

Or, one pound salt, one-half pint of sage and three and one-half ounces 
pepper, scattered over forty pounds of meat before grinding. 

£eef-8Teak for Winter Use. — Cut the steak large, and the usual thick- 
ness; have ready a mixture made of salt, sugar and finely powdered salt- 
petre, mixed in the same proportion as for corning beef; sprinkle the bottom 
of a large jar with salt, lay in a piece of steak, and sprinkle over it some of 



516 HOW TO CUT ASD CURE MEATS. 

the mixture, as much or a little more than you would use to season in cook- 
ing, tlien put in another slice, sprinkle, and so on till jar is filled, with a 
sprinkle of the mixture on ton; over all, put a plate, with a wei|?bt on it, 
and set in a cool, airy place, wliere it wiil not freeze. This needs no brine, 
as it makes a brine of its own. Twenty-five or thirty i)Ounds may be kept 
perfectly sweet in this wa}'. Take out to u.se as wanted, and broil or fry as 
usual. * • 

Virginia 8al'.'<a({e Meat. — Pick the sausajre meat to get out all the pieces 
of bones and strinjrs; wa.sh it in lukewarm water, and lay on a table to 
drain ; let it stand uH nijrht. Take oft' .*?oine of the fat from the backbone to 
mix with the lean, if you use ''leaf fat" when you fry the sausage, it will 
Molt away to gravy and leave a little knot of lean, hard'and dry, floating in 
1 sea of melted grease. The fat must be taken ofl' before the chines are 
sahed, and washed, skinned and put to drain with the lean. Next day, choj« 
it fine, picking out all the strings. When fine enough, season it with salt. 
sage, black and red peijper, to taste. Pack it in a close vessel. If you wish 
to stuff them, have some nicely-cleaned chitterlings kept in salt and water 
ten days or a fortnight. Stufi*, hang on sticks and dry. A little smoke im- 
proves them ; too much makes them bitter. 

To Salt Pork. — Allow the meat to stand until the animal heat is entirely 
out of it; cut the sides into strips crosswise; cover the bottom of a barrel 
with salt, and pack in the pork closely edj^ewise, with rind next the barrel: 
cover each layer with salt, and proceed in like manner until all has been put 
in. Make a strong brine sufficient to cover the pork (soft water is best, and 
there is no danger of getting it too salt), boil, SKim and pour into the barrel 
while bailing hot. Have a board cut out round, a little smaller than the bar- 
rel, put over the pork, and on it place a weight heavy enough to keep it 
always under the brine. If at any time the orine froths or looks rea, it 
must be turned ofl^, scalded and returned while hat. Never put cold brine on 
old pork, unless you wish to lose it. In salting down a new supply of pork, 
boil down the old brine, remove the scum, and then pour it over the pork aa 
directed above. 

Trying Lard. — Cut the fat into small pieces, put into kettle, and pour in 
enough water to cover the bottom ; boil gently until the " scraps" settle, or 
until the water has all evaporated, stirring often to prevent burning. Take 
off, strain into stone jars, and set in a coot place. The quality of the lard is 
improved by sprinkling over and slowly stirring in one tablespoon of sods to 
every five gallons of lard, just before removing from the fire. After adding 
soda*, the kettle must be removed from the stove, and watched closely, ana 
stirred constantly, as it foams rapidly, and is very likely to run over, and, 
if on stove, is likely to take fire. The leaf should be tried by itself for the 
nicest cooking. That from the smaller intestines, and the flabby pieces, not 
fit for salting, should be thrown into lukewarm water and allowed to stand 
for twenty-four hours, and then should be tried by itself, and the lard set 
away where it will freeze, and, by spring, the strong taste will be gone. A 
tca-cup.of water prevents burning while trying. 

How TO Cut up Pork.— Split through the spine, cut off each half of head 
behind the ear, remove the pieces in front of the shoulder, for sausaee. 
Take out feaf which lies around kindeys, for lard ; cut out tlie lean meat, ribs, 
etc.. then tne ham and shoulder, and remove the loose pieces directly in 
front of the ham, for lard. Cut off a narrow strip of the belly, for sausage; 
and cut up the remainder, which is clear pork, into five or six strips of 
about equal width, for salting down. Smoke the jowl with hams, ana use 
the upper part of the head for boiling, or baking, or head-cheese. 

Scorch the feet over the fire until the hoofs remove easily, scrape clean, 
place in hot water a few minutes, wash and scrape thoroughly, and they are 
ready for cooking. 

All the flabby pieces shouldTbe tried up for lard. Remove all fat from in- 
testines, saving that which does not easily come off the larger intestines for

soap-grease. The liver, heart, sweet-hreads and kidneys are all used for boil- 
ing or frying, and the smaller intestines are sometimes used for sausage cases. 

The Despabd Red Round. — A round of beef weighing twenty-five pounds, 
one ounce of cloves, three ounces of saltpetre, three ounces of coarse su^r, 
half an ounce of allspice, six ounces of common salt, one nutmeg. The 
beef should hang two or thee days ; then take out the bone, rub the spicks 
and salt thoroughly together, and rub them well into the beef on both sides; 
cover the beef, turn and rub it every day for from two to three weeks. 
When you wish to use it, dip it in cold water to remove the loose spice ; bind 
it closely several times around the sides with a long strip of cotton cloth two 
inches wide; put it in a pan with half a pint of water m the bottom to pre- 
vent burning; cover the top of the meat with shred suet, and cover the pan 
with a crust half an inch thick, made of water and Graham or other flour, 
seeing that it adheres to the edge of the pan. Lay a brown paper over the 
crust; bake it slowly for five or six hours. The gravy, of wnich there will 
be a large quantity, may be used in soup, in beef-pie, or in hash. The place 
from which the bone was taken may be rub)>ed with fine chopped parsley, 
and sweet herbs may be laid between the skin and the meat. 

To Clear Beep Tripe. — Empty the paunch, rinse it thoroughly in cold 
water, being careful not to let any or the contents get on the outside. 
Make strong cleansed water or white lye, let it heat a little, too warm to 
hold the hands in, pour it over tlie tripe in a tub, let it stand two or three 
hours, then tack it up against a board, and with a knife scrape downwards, 
taking off the inner sKin, or rinse it clean in cold water; sprinkle lime over, 
put in a tub, cover with warm water, and let it stand two or three houre, 
then scrape it with a knife ; if the dark does not all come off easil3% sprinkle 
more lime on, and let it lie for an hour longer, then scrape again, and rinse 
in cold water until clean. Place it in water enough to cover with a large 
handful of salt, let it remain in the salt water three days and nights, chang- 
ing it each day, then take it out) cut in pieces about six inches wide and 
twelve long, lay in buttermilk for a few hours to whiten; then rinse it clean 
in cold water, and boil until tender; it will tiike from four to ten hours, aa 
it should be done so that it can be mashed with the fingers. After thus pre* 
pared it can be cooked as preferred. 

To Cure Hams AtND Bacon. — When killed and cool cut up, and begin im- 
mediately to salt them. Rub the outside of each ham witn a teaspoon of 
powdered saltpetre, and the inside with a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Hav- 
ing mixed together two pounds of brown sugar and salt, mixed m tne propor- 
tion of one pound and a half of sugar to a pint of salt, rub the i)ork well 
with it. This qtiantity of sugar and salt will be sufficient for fifty pounds 
of meat. Have ready some large tubs, the bottom sprinkled with salt, and 
lay the meat in the tubs with the skin downward. Put plenty of stilt be- 
tween each laypr of meat. After it has lain eight days, take it out and wipe 
off the salt, and wtush tlie tubs. Make a pickle of soft water, equal quanti- 
ties of salt and molasses and a little .saltpetre ; allowing five ounces of salt|)etre 
to two quarts of molasses and two quarts of salt, which is the proportion for 
fifty pountls of meat. The pickle must he strong enough to hear up an egg. 
Boil and skim it, an<l, when it is cold, pour it over the meat, which must he. 
turneii frequently and basted with the pickle. The hauLs should remain in 
the pickle at least four weeks; the bacon three weeks. They should then 
be taken out and smoked. Having washed off the pickle, before you smoke 
the meat, bury it while wet in a tub of hran. This will form a criist over it, 
and prevent evap)ratk)n of the juices. Let the smoke-house be readv to 
receive the meat immediately. Take it out of the tub after it has lain half 
an hour, and rub the hran evenly over it. Then liang it up to smoke "with 
the small end downwanl. Tongues may be cured in the above manner. 

Brine for Beef, Hams and SiiorLnERs. — To one hundred pounds beef, 
take eight pounds salt, five of sugar or five pints molasses (Orleans best, but 
•ny good will do), two ounces soda, one ounce saltpeter, four gallons soft

water, or enough to cover the meat. Mix part of tlie salt and sugar together^ 
rub each piece and place it in the barrel (oak is best), having covered the bot- 
tom with salt. When the meat is all in, put the remainder of salt and sugar 
in the water. Dissolve the soda and saltpeter in hot water, add it to the brine 
and pour over the meat; place a board on top of meat, with a weight sufii- 
cient to keep it under the hrine. Let the pieces intended for dried beef re- 
main in the brine for three weeks, take out, place in a tub, cover with water, 
let stand over night, string and dry. String it (smoke for a few days, if you 
like), hang it up to ceiling over the kitchen stove, or on a frame set Ijehind 
the st<jve, turn round once a day so as to give all parts an equal exposure, 
and let remain for three or four weeks. Test by cutting a piece, which 
.sliould be well dried on the outsi<ie, and froe from raw^ness to the center. 
When dried, sprinkle with ground black pepper, put in paper sacks, tie up 
lightly, and hang in a C(K)1, dry, dark place, or put, without sacks, in an empty 
flour barrel, and cover closely. Boil hrine, skim well, let cool, and pour orer 
the bonv pieces left. Those are good boiled and eaten either hot or cold, and 
thev will Keep good for several months. Tongue may be pickled with the 
beel. 

Brine made the same way, with the addition of two pounds more of salt, 
is good for hams and shoulders. Take part of the mixture of salt and sugar, 
rub each piece thoroughly on fleshy side, lay in barrel (having first covered 
the bottom with salt) skin side down. When all are in, make a pickle of the 
remainder of the mixture, as directed in "Brine for Beef," pour over the 
meat; have a round board, a little smaller than the barrel, place on the meat 
with a weight (a large stone is good, W'hich may be w^ashed clean and laid 
away to be used year after year), sufficient to keep it under the brine; let 
remain from four to eight weeks, according to size; take out, drain, sprinkle 
with cayenne penper, particularly around the bone. Hang them ready to 
smoke, let them urain for two days, and then smoke with corn cobs or green 
hickory or maple wood, taking care to have smoke, bvt not fire enough to vmke 
heat. Hang up to smoke with hock downwards, as the skin then retains the 
juices of the meat. After smoking four weeks take down, sprinkle with 
ground black pepper, tie tightly, in whole paper sacks, hang in a dry, dark, 
cool place, watching closely for fear of mold. Or, wrap in paper, sew in a. 
coarse, cotton bag, whitewash on the outside and hang near the roof in the 
garret; or, wrap in brown i)aper, and cover with dry ashes {dry leached ashes 
are best); or, pack without sacks, hock end upixM-most, in oats or shelled 
corn, or in clean, sweet hay, before tlics come. Cover box or barrel closely, 
i.nd keep in a dry, cool place. If there is any danger from flies, take direct 
from smoke-house and pack immediately. Brine for pickled pork should 
have all the salt it will dissolve, and a peck or half bushel in bottom oi bar- 
rel. If pork is salted in this manner it will never siwil, but the strength of 
the brine makes it necessary to salt the hams and side meats separately. 
Pork when killed should be tfwroughh/ cooled before salting, but should nf»t re- 
main longer than one or two days. It should never be frozen before .salting, 
!i.s this is as injurious as saltitig before it is cooled. Large Quantities of ix)rk 
.re lost by failing to observe these rules. If pickled pork begins to sour, 
t ike it out of the brine, rinse well in clear, cold water, place a layer in a bar- 
rel, on this place charcoal in lumps tlie size of a hen's egg or smaller, add a 
layer of meat and so on, until all is in the barrel, cover with a weak brine, 
let stand twenty-four hours ; take meat out, rim<e off the charcoal, put it into 
a new strong brine, remembering always to have plenty of salt in the barrel 
(more than the water will dissolve). If the same barrel is used, cleanse it bv 
placing a small quantity of quicklime in it, .slack with hot water, add as much 
salt as the water will "dissolve, and cover tightly to keep the steam in; let 
stand for a few hours or over night, rinse well, and it is ready for use. Thi* 
is an excellent way to cleanse any barrel that has become impure. The pork 
must not be salted in whisky barrels; molasses barrels are the best. The 
whisky is said to injure the baron. — II Biixton. 



HINTS ON BUTTER-MAKING. 



No sloven can make good butter. The one thing to be kept in mindi moni«> 
ing, noon, and night, is neatness, neatness, neatness. The milking should 
be done in the cleanest place that can be found, and the cows should be kept 
as clean as possible. Wash the teats and udden thoroughly with plenty of 
cold water, and wipe with a cloth or towel. Never wash with the hand 
moistened with milk from the cow. The least impurity taints the cream, 
and takes from the sweetness of the butter. Milk perfectly clean (as the 
last quart is twice as rich in butter as the first), and the quicker the milking 
is done the more milk is obtained. The milk-room should be clean and 
sweet, its air pure, and temperature about 62 degreea As soon as a pail is 
filled, take to the milk-room and strain the milk through a fine wire-cloth 
strainer, kept for the purpose, and not attached to the pail (the simple 
strainer being more easily kept clean). Never allow milk to stand in tho 
stable and cool, as it absorbs the foul o<lorsof the place. The pans (flat stone 
crocks with flaring sides are better than tin pans. In winter hot water 
should be poured into them while milking is being done, and poured out 
just before straining the milk into them) should be set on slats, rather than 
shelves, as it is important to have the milk cooled from the animal heat as 
soon as possible. Skim each day. or at longest within twenty-four hours. 
Souring does not injure the quality of the cream, but the milk should not 
be allowed to become watery. Do not use a perforated skimmer, but re- 
move a little of the milk with the cream, as this does not injure the quality 
or lessen the quantity of butter, and gives more well-flavored buttermilk, 
which is a favorite and wholesome drink. If there is cream enough each 
day, it should, of course, be churned, and this plan makes the best butter, 
although it takes longer to chum it. If not, the cream should be set aside 
in a cool place, covered, and stirred thoroughly whenever more is added. It 
ought not to stand more than two days, and mu.st not be allowe<l to become 
bitter and flaky. The best plan is to churn as soon as it becomes slightly 
acid. Scald the churn and dash thoroughly, and put in the cream at a tem- 
perature of !yS degrees. The motion of the churn will soon bring it up to 
about 60 degrees. When the butter comes put a quart or two of cold, soft 
water (or ice is better) into the churn to harden the butter, and make it 
•easier to gather up. After gathering it as well as possible with the dash, it 
should be removed to the table or bowl, and thoroughly worked with a flat 
wooden paddle, (never with the hand, as the insensible perspiration will 
more or less taint the butter), using an abundance of cold goft water to wash 
out the buttermilk and harden the butter. By this process the buttermilk 
is removed quickly, and there is no need of excessive working, which in- 
jures the grain of the butter. This is especially true of that which is to be 

(61Sl> 



520 HINTS ON BUTTER-MAKINO. 

packed, as it keeps longer when well washed. If to be used immediately, 
the washing may be less thorough. Another and better plan is to remove 
the butter to a marble slab and lay on the top of it a piece of ice. As it 
settles down by its own weight, work it up around the edges with the paddle, 
and the water from tlio melting ice will wash out and carry off the butter- 
milk. Before or during the churning, the bowl (which should never be 
used for any thing else) in which the butter is to be salted, should be filled 
with scalding water, which should remain for ten minutes; pour out and 
rub both bowl and paddle with hard coarse salt, which prevents butter from 
sticking. Rinse thoroughly and fill with cold or ice-water to cool. After 
washing butter free from milk, remove to this bowl, having first poured out 
the cold water, and (thq butter-bowl and paddle should occasionally be 
scoured with sand or ashes, washed thoroughly with soap-suds, and rinsed 
until all smell of soap has disappeared) work in gradually salt which has 
been pulverized by rolling, and freed from foreign substances. If wanted 
for use, one-half ounce of salt to the pound of butter is sufficient, but if 
wanted for packing, use three-fourths of an ounce or even an ounce of salt 
Use only the best quality of dairy salt. After salting, cover with cotton 
cloth soaked in brine, and .wt away itt a temperature of about 60 degrees for 
twelve hours. Work the second time just enough to get the remaining but- 
termilk out. This, however, must be done thoroughly, as otherwise the 
acid of the buttermilk will make the butter rancid. At the end of tlie 
second working it is ready for use, and should be kept in a clean, sweet place, 
as it soon absorbs bad odors and becomes tainted. Tlie air of a cellar in 
which are decaying vegetables soon ruins the sweetest butter. In packing for 
market (ash butter tubs are the neatest and best packages) soak the package 
for twelve hours in brine strong enough to float an egg, pack the butter in 
evenly and firmly, having first put in a thin layer of salt. If the tub is not 
filled by the first packing, set away until next churning, in a cool place, 
with a cotton cloth wet in brine spread over the butter, and place cover 
carefully on the tub. When filled lay over the butter a cotton cloth (from 
which the sizing has been washed) soaked in strong brine, nail up the tub, 
and set away in a clean, cool place until ready to sell. 

In packing for family u.se, work into rolls, lay in large stone crocks, cover 
with Drine strong enougli to float an egg (one pint of .salt to a gallon of 
water), in winch a level tea-spoon of saltpetre and a {>ound of white .sugar 
to each two gallons have been added ; over it place a cotton cloth and a 
\v(M"<;}it to keep the butter under the brine, ana tie a paper over the top 
nf crock. Or, pack in a .stone jar, pressing it solid with a wooden pestle, 
I'over with a cloth wet in brine, and .«?prinkle over it salt an inch thick. 
More sugar may be added to the brine without injury; if butter is to be 
kept a long time it is a good rule to always make brine so strong that salt 
will lie at the bottom of the jar. Some boil and skim the brine and when 
ro/<i, pour it over the butter. When ready to pack the next churning, re- 
move the cloth with the salt carefully, rinsing otf" with water any that may 
have been scattered in uncovering it, pack butter as before, replace cloth 
with salt over it, and repeat until jar is filled to within two inches of the 
top, cover all with cloth, add salt to the top of crock, tie paper over the top, 
and .«et in a cool place. In removing for use each churning conies out by 
itself. 



THE LATJNDET. 



When inyitlng friends to vis ts of a week or more, try to fix the time for 
the visit to begin the day after the ironing is done. The girl feels a weight 
off her mind, has time to cook the meals better and is a much more willing 
attendant upon guests. 

Do not have beefsteak for dinner on washing or ironing days — arrange to 
have something roasted in the oven, or else have cold meat also. 

Do not have fried or broiled fish. The smell sticks, and the clothes will not 
be sweet; besides the broiler and frying-pan take longer to clean. 

As for vegetables, do not have spinach, pease, string-beans, or apple-sauce. 
All these good things take time tp prepare, and can be avoided as well as not. 
Have baked white and sweet potatoes, macaroni, boiled rice, parsnips, sweet 
corn, stewed tomatoes, any canned vegetables in winter. For dessert, baked 
apples and cream, bread-pudding, or something easily prepared. 

When removed from the person, clothing, if damp, should be dried to pre- 
vent mildew, and articles which are to be starched should be mended before 
placing in the clothes-baskpt. Monday is the washing day with all good 
housekeepers. The old-fashioned programme for a washing is as follows: 
Use good soft water if it can be had. If not, soften a barrel-full of well-water 
by pouring into it water in which half a peck or more of hard wood ashes 
have been boiled, together with the ashes themselves. When enough has 
been added to produce the desired effect, the water takes on a curdled 
appearance, and soon settles perfectly clear. If milky, more ashes and lye 
must be added as before, care being taken not to add more than is necessary 
to clear the water, or it will affect the hands unpleasantly. On the other 
hand, if too little is put in, the clothes will turn yellow. Gather up all 
clothes which are ready on Saturday night, and the rest as they are taken 
off; separate the fine from the coarse, and the less soiled from the dirtier. 
Scald all table linen and articles which have coffee, fruit, or other stains 
which would be "set" by hot suds, by ^iouring over them hot water froii- 
the tea-kettle and allowing them to stand until cool. Have the water in iho 
tub as warm as the hand will bear, but not too hot. (Dirty oloihes should 
never be put into very hot clear water, as it " sets " the dirt. Hot soap-suds, 
however, has the opposite effect, the wat^r expanding the fiber of the fabric, 
while the alkali of the soap softens and removes the dirt.) Wash first one 
boiler full, taking the cleanest and finest through two suds, then place in a 
boiler of cold water, with soap enough to make a good suds. A handful of 
borax to about ten gallons of water helps to whiten the clothes and is used 
by many, especially by the Germans, who are famous for their snowy linen. 
33 (5^1) 



522 THE LAUNDRY. 

This saves in soap nearly half. For laces, cambrics, etc., an extra quantity of 
the powder is used, and for crinolines (requiring to be made stiff), a strong 
solution is necessary. Borax, being a neutral salt, does not in the slightest 
degree injure the texture of the linen. Its eifect is to soften the hardest water. 
Another way to whiten clothes is to throw a handful of tansy into the boiler 
in which clothes are boiling. It will make the water green, but will whiten 
the clothes. l*et them boil, with cover off boiler, not more than five or ten min- 
uU8, as too long boiling " yellows" the clothes. (Some advocate strongly no 
boiling.) Remove to a tub, pour over them cold water slightly blued, and 
turn all garments, pillow-slips, stockings, etc., wrong-side out. (If there are 
more to boil, take out part of the boiling suds, add cold water, and fill not 
too full with clothes. Repeat until all are boiled. The removal of part of 
the suds, and filling up with cold water, prevents the suds from " yellowing" 
the clothes.) Wash vigorously in this water (this is called "sudsing"), 
wringing very dry by hand, or better with the wringer, as the clear appear- 
ance of the clothes depends largely on thorough wringing. Rinse in another 
tub of soft water, washing with the hands, not simply lifting them out of the 
water and then wringing, as is practiced by some, because all suds must be 
rinsed out to make them clear and white. Wring and shake out well and put 
into water pretty well blued, putting in one article after another until the 
first boilerful is all in. Stir up occasionally, as the blue sometimes settles to 
the bottom, and thus spots the clothes. (This time well-water may be used 
if soft water is difficult to obtain.) Wring out again and for the last time, 
placing the clothes which are to be starched in one basket, and the rest, 
which may be hung out immediately, in another. While the first lot of 
clothes is boiling, prepare the second, take out first, put second in boiler, and 
**8uds" and rinse first In this way the first is finished and hung out while 
the later lots are still under way. Have the starch (see recipes) ready as hot 
as the hand can bear, dip the articles and parts of articles which need to be 
very stiff, first "clapping" the starch well in with the hands, especially in 
shirt-bosoms, wristbands, and collars, and then thin the starch for other arti- 
cles which require less stiffening. When starched, hang out on the line to 
dry, first wiping the line with a cloth to remove all dirt and stains. Shake 
out each article until it is free from wrinkles, and fasten securely on the line 
(with the old-fashioned split clothe.s-pins), being careful to hang sheets and 
table-linen so that the selvage edges will be even. The line should be 
stretched in the airiest place in the yard, or in winter a large attic is a better 
place for the purpose. (Freezing injures starch, and for that reason it is 
better in winter to hang clothes out unstarched until dry, then taking in, 
starching and drying indoors.) When dry, remove from line to clothes- 
basket, place clothes-pins as removed in a basket kept for the purpose, take 
down and roll up the line, remove basket, line, and pins to the house, and 
put the two latter into their proper places. The clothes-line should always 
be carefully put up out of the weather when not in use. Wipe it carefully 
with a clean cloth before hanging out clothes, and always count clothes-pins 
when gathering them up. Every housekeeper ought to provide a pair of 



THE LAUNDRY. 523 

mittens for hanging out clothes, to be used for this purpose and no other. 
Cut them from clean flannel (white seems the most suitable), and line them 
with another thickness of flannel, or make them double, if the flannel is thin. 
These should be kept in a clean place ready for this particular business, and 
nothing else. A good and handy place to keep them is in the clotlies-pia 
bag. Turn all garments right side out, shake out thoroughly, sprinkle 
(re-starching shirt^bosoms, wristbands, and collars if necessary). Shake out 
night-dresses and under-garments so as to free them from creases, and if they 
are ruffled or embroidered, dip them in thin starcli, pull out smoothly, fold 
first, and then, beginning at the top of each garment, roll up, each by itseli", 
in a very tight roll, and place in the basket; fold sheets without sprinkling, 
having first snapped and stretched them, and lay on the rest ; over all spread 
the ironing blanket, and let them stand until next morning. Next day iron, 
beginninj? with the sheets (which, as well as table linen, must be folded 
neatly and carefully, so that the selvago edges will exactly come together. 
Or, another way to fold and iron a sheet is to bring bottom overtop, then 
bring back bottom edge to edge of middle fold, leaving top edge; iron the 
upper surface, then turn the whole sheet over, fold the top edge back to the 
middle edge, and again iron upper surface ; this leaves the sheet folded iu 
four thicknesses; now bring the selvage edges together and iron the upper 
surface, and the sheet is done) , and taking shirts next, cooling the iron when 
too hot on the coarse towels. In ironing shirts a "a bosom-board" is almost 
indispensable, and an ** ironing-board" is a great convenience for all articles. 
The former is a hard wood board an inch thick, eighteen inches long, and 
eight wide, covered with two thicknesses of woolen blanket stuff, overlaid 
with two more of cottton cloth. The cloth is wrapped over the sides and ends 
of the board and tacked on the back side, leaving the face plain and smooth. 
The ironing-board is covered in the same way, but is five feet long, two feet 
wide at one end, and narrowed down with a rounded taper from full width 
at the middle to seven inches at the other end, and the corners rounded. 
This board may be of any well-seasoned wood which will not warp, and 
should be about one inch thick; on this ail the clothes are conveniently 
ironed. Always use cotton holders for the irons. Woolen ones are hot to 
^he hand, and if scorched, as they often are, the smell is disagreeable. In 
Toning a shirt or a dress, turn the sleeves on the wrong side, and leave them 
aniil the rest is done, and then turn and iron them. In this way the bosoms 
ire less likely to become rumpled. Pull muslin and lace out carefully, iron 
it over once, and then pull into shape, pick out the embroidery and proceed 
with greater care than before. Embroideries should be ironed on the wrong 
side over flannel. Always have near a dish of clean cold water, so that any 
?pot which has been im perfectly' ironed may be easily wet with a soft sponge 
jr piece of linen, and ironed over again, or any surplus bit of starch removed. 
As fast as articles are finished, they should be hung on the clothes-dryer 
until thoroughly dry, especial care being taken with those which are starched 
stiff, as they retain the starch much better if dried very quickly. Thorough 
airing is necessary, twenty-four hours being none too much. 



524 THE LAUNDRY. 

If a machine is used in washing, it is better to soak the clothes over night 
in warm soft water, soaping collars and wristbands, and pieces most soiled. 
Have separate tabs for coarse and fine clothes. In soaking clothes for wash- 
ing Monday, the water should be prepared Saturday night, and all clothes 
which are ready thrown in, and the rest added when changed. If washing 
fluids are used, the recipes which follow are the best. 

Another method is to half fill tubs Saturday night with clear, soft water, 
warmed a little if convenient, but not too hot, made into a weak suds ; in one 
put the finer articles, such as muslins, cuffs, collars, and shirts; in another 
put table-linen ; in another bed-linen ; in another the dish-cloths and wiping 
towels, and in still another the coarsest and most soiled articles : always put 
the most ^iled articles of each division at bottom of tub ; cover all well with 
water and press down. Rub no soap on spots or stains, as it will '^ set " them. 
Of course, articles which can not be had on Saturday night are put in the 
next day as they are changed. Monday morning, heat not very hot a boiler 
full of clean soft water, add to it water in which soap waa dissolved Saturday 
night by pouring hot water over it, and stir it thoroughly; drain off the 
water in which the clothes were soaked after shaking them up and down 
vigorously in it, pressing them against the sides of the tub to get out all the 
water possible. Then pour over them tlie warm suds, and wash out as before 
described, washing each class separately. If found impracticable to make 
BO many divisions, separate the coarse and fine, and the least soiled and the 
dirtiest. 

In the summer, clothes may be washed without any fire by soaking over- 
night in soapy soft water, rubbing out in the morning, soaping the dirty 
places, and laying them in the hot sunshine. By the time the last are spread 
out to bleach, the first may be taken up, washed out and rinsed. This, of 
course, requires a clean lawn. 

Before washing flannels shake out dust and lint; use soft, clean^ cold water, 
in winter merely taking the chill off. Let the hard soap lie in the water, but 
do not apply it to the clothes. Wash the whit.e pieces first, throw articles as 
fast as washed into blued cold water, let them stand twenty or thirty min- 
utes, wash them through this water after dissolving a little soap in it. wring 
hard, shake, and hang up. Wash colored flannels in the same way (but not 
In water used for white, or they will gather the lint), and rinse in se\'^ral 
waters if inclined to **run.'* When very dirty, all flannels should soak 
longer, and a little borax well dissolved should be added to the water. This 
process is equally good for washing silk goods and silk embroideries. Cali- 
coes and fancy cotton stockings may be washed in the same way, except that 
no soap should be used in the rinsing, Wash gray and brown linens in cold 
water, with a little black pepper in it, and tliey will not fade. For bluing, 
use the best indigo tied in a strong bag made of drilling. 

To Cleanse Articles made op White Zephyb. — Rub in flour or magnesia, 
changing often. Shake off flour and liang in the open air a short time. 

To Remove Ink-staix.— Immediately saturate with milk, soak it up with 
a rag, apply more, rub well, and in a few minutes the ink will disappear. 



THE LA UNDBY. 525 

To Clean Alpaca. — Sponge with strained coffee. Iron on the wrong side, 
having black cambric under the goods. 

Take out Machine Oil. — Iluu with a little Inrd or butter and wash in 
warm water and sosip, or, simply rub first with a little soap and wash out 
in cold water. 

To Stiffen Linen Cuffs and Collars. — Add a small piece of white wax 
and one tea-spoon brand v to a pint of fine starch. In ironing, if the iron, 
sticks^ soap the bottom of it. 

Is Washing Children's Stockings, wooden stocking forms are a great 
help on wiiich to dry them. Obtain tliem at the furnishing store, or nave 
them made without much expense. 

To Clean Wash Boilers. — Wash, when a little rusty, with sweet milk; 
or grease with lard. A better plan is to prevent rust by thoroughly dry- 
ing boiler, as well as tubs, before putting awajr for the week. 

To Take out Paint. — Equal parts of ammonia and spirits of turpentine 
will take paint out of clothing, no matter how dry or hard it may be. 
Saturate the spot two or three times and then wash out in soap-suds. 

To Restore Velvet. — When velvet gets crushed from pressure, hold the 
parts over a basin of hot water, with the lining of the dress next the water. 
The pile will soon rise and assume its original beauty. 

Spots. — In cloth or calico, produced by an acid, may be removed by touch- 
ing the spot with spirits of hartshorn. Spots produced by an alkali may be 
removed by moistening them witli vinegar or tartaric acid. 

To Prevent Blue from Fading. — To prevent blue from fading, put an 
ounce of sugar of lead into a pail of water, soak tlie material in the solution 
for two hours, and let dry before being washed and ironed; good for all 
shades of blue. 

To Take Out Mildew. — Wet the cloth and rub on soap and chalk, mixed 
together, and lay in tlie sun ; or lay the cloth in buttermilk for a short 
time, take out and place in the hot sun; or put lemon juice on, and treat 
in the same way. 

To Re.move Ink Stains from Clothing. — Dip the spots in pure melted 
tallow ; wash out tlie tallow and the ink will come out If articles are 
rubbed out in cold water while the stain is fresh, the stain will often be 
entirely removed. 

For Washinw Red Table Linen, use tepid water, with a little powdered 
borax, which ser\'es to set the color; wash the linen separately ana quickly, 
using very little soan, rinse in tepid water, containing a little boiled starch; 
hang to dry in the stiade, and iron when almost dry. 

To Clean Alpaca, — Put goods in a boiler half full of cold rain-water, 
and let boil three minutes. Have ready a pail of indigo^water (very dark 
with indigo), place goods in it, after wringing out of boiling water, let re- 
main one-half an hour, then wring out, and iron while damp. 

How to Clean Velvet. — Invert a hot flat-iron, place over it a single 
thickness of wet cotton cloth, lay on this the velvet, wrong side next the 
wet cloth, rub gently with a dry cloth until the pile is well rai.sed; take ofl 
the iron, lay on a table, and brush it with a soft brush or cloth. 

To Take Grease out of Silks, Woolens, Paper, Fix)or8. etc. — Grate 
thick over the spot French (or commcm will do) chalk, cover with brown 
paper, set on it a hot flatiron, and let it remain until cool; repeat if neces- 
sary. The iron must not be .so hot as to burn paper or cloth. 

Substitute for Washino-Soda. — A German scientific journal recommends 
laundresses to use hyi)Osulphite of so<la in place of common washing-soda. 
It does not attack the fabric in any way, and at the same time exerts some 
bleaching actions which greatly improve the appearance of linen and calicoes. 

Silver Polish for Shirts. — One ounce each of isinglass and borax, one 
tea-spoon white glue, two t€a-s|K>ons white of an e^. Cook well in two 

aaarts of fine starch. Starch in this and dry. Before ironing, apply some of 
^ to the bosom and cuffs with a cloth till well dampened. Iron at once with 
a hot glossing iron. 



526 THE LAUSDRY. 

To Clean Black Lace.— Take the lace and wipe off all the dusl care- 
fully, with a cambric handkerchief. Then pin it out on a board, insert- 
ing a pin in each projecting point of the lace. 8(Mit it all over with table- 
beer, and do not remove the pins until it is perfectly dry. It will look 
quite fresh and new. 

To make Soap to do away wfth Ri'bbino. — Dissolve five bars of soap in 
four ^llons soft water, one and three-fourths pounds sal -soda, and three- 
fourths pound borax; stir while cooling. Use one cupful to make suds to 
soak clothes in ; wring out and put into the boiler; use same quantity of 
soap for boiling the same. 

Enamel for Shirt Bosoms. — Melt togetlier with a gentle heat, one ounce 
white wax and two ounces spermaceti ; prepare in the usual way a sufficient 
quantity of starch for a dozen bosoms, put into it a piece of this enamel the 
size of a hazel-nut, and in proportion for a lai*ge number. This will give 
clothes a beautiful ])olish. 

To Remove the Color from Buff Calico. — If some kinds of buff calico 
are dipj>ed in strong soda water, the color will be removed and the figures 
of other colors remain on a white ground. This is valuable sometimes, as 
buff calico spots easily. If pink calico be dipped in vinegar and water 
after rinsing, the color will be brighter. 

To Remove the Stain of Nitrate of Silver — from the flesh, or white 
goods of any kind, dissolve iodine in alcohol, and apply to the stain ; then 
take a piece of cyanide potassium, size of a hickory-nut, wet in water, rub 
on the S])Ot, and the stain will immediately disappear; then wash the goods 
or hands in cold water. — G. W. Collins, Urhnnn. 

Mother's Hard-times Soap. — Take all the bits of soap that are too small 
to be longer used, shave down, and let soak in soft water enough to cover 
them over night; in the morning add more soft water, and boil until 
thoroughly melted and of the consistency of taffy ; pour into molds, and you 
have a nice cake of soap. — Miss Addie Mnnsell. 

Coffee Starch. — Make a paste of two table-spoons best starch and cold 
water; when smooth stir in a pint of perfectly clear coffee (made by pouring 
boiling water on the grounds left from breakfast and straining) boiling 
hot; boil five or ten minutes, stir with a spermaceti or wax candle, strain, 
and use for all dark calicoes, percales, and muslin.s. 

To Remove Iron-Rust. — While rinsing clothes, take .such as have spots 
of rust, wring out, dip a wet finger in oxalic acid, and rub on the spot, then 
dip in salt and rub on, and hold on a warm flatiron, or on the tin or cop- 
per tea- kettle if it have hot water in it, and the spot will immediately dis- 
appear; rinse again, rubbing the place a little with the hands. 

Erasive Fluid. — For the removal of spots on furniture, cloth, silks, and 
other fabrics, when the color is not drawn, without injury: One ounce 
castile soap, four of aqua ammonia, one of glycerine, and one of spirits of 
wine; dissolve the soap in two quarts soft water, add the other ingredients, 
apply with a soft sponge, and rub out. — A. Peabwbj, Cincinnati, 0. 

To Clean White Satin and Flowered Silks. — Mix sifted stale bread- 
crumbs with powder blue, and rub it thoroughly all over, then shake it well 
and dust it well with clean, soft cloths. Afterwards where there are any 
gold or silver flowers, take a piece of crimson ingrain velvet, and rub the 
flowers with it, which will restore them to their original Ulster. 

For Washing Goods that Fade, use crude ammonia instead of soap. 
Soiled neckties may be made to look like new by taking one-half a tea- 
spoon of spirits of hortshom to a tea-cup of water; wash well, and, if veiy 
much soiled, put through a second water, with less ammonia in. Lay it 
on a clean, white cloth, and gently wipe with another until dry. 

To Clean Silk and Woolen Dress Goods. — Any silk or wooled goods 
may be washed in gasoline, rubbing as if in water, without injury. The 
dirt is quickly and easily removed, but no change takes place in tlie color 
of the uibric. Great care must be taken not to use the gajtoline near a store or iightf 



THE LAUNDRY. 527 

as there is a gas arising from it which is very inflammahle, and might take 
fire from a lamp set a foot or two distant. 

In washing the dish-wipkrs, do not boil them with tlie fine white dresses, 
shirts, table-cloths, sheets, piliow-cases, napkins, or fine towels, but be as par- 
ticular to have tlie suds nice and clean. It is better to remove a part of 
the suds, and add clean cold water, so that the wipers will not become 
yellow by boiling in too strong a suds. On each wash-day wash thoroughly 
all that have been used the previous week. . 

Silk and Thread Gloves are best washed by placing them on the hands, 
and washing in borax water or white castile soap-suds, the same &» if wash- 
ing the hands; rinse under a stream of water, and dry with a towel; keep 
the gloves on until they are about lialf dried, take off carefully, and fold 
them up so that they will look as nearly like what they were when new as 
possible, and lay between clean towels under a weight. 

To Clean Ribbons. — Dissolve white soap in boiling water; when cool 
enough to bear the hand, pass the ribbons through it, rubbing gently so as 
not to iniure the texture; rinse through lukewarm water, and pin on a 
board to dry. If the colors are bright yellow, maroon, crimson, or scarlet, 
add a few drops of oil of vitriol to the rinse-water; if the color is bright 
scarlet, add to the rinse-water a few drops of the muriate of tin. 

Brown Linen — May be kept looking new until worn out if always washed 
in starch-water and hay tea. Make nour starch in the ordinary way. For 
one dress put on the stove a common sized milk pan full of timothy hay, 
pour on water, cover, and boil until the water is of a dark green color, then 
turn into the starch, let the goods soak in it a few minutes, and wash with^ 
out soap ; the starch will clean the fabric and no rinsing is necessary. 

To Wash Colored MusLiNS.-^Wash in warm, not hot, suds, made with 
soft water and best white soap, if it is to be had. Do not soak them, and 
wash only one thing at a time. Change the suds as soon as it looks dingy, 
and put the garments at once into fresh suds. Rinse first in clear water, 
then in slightly blued. Squeeze quite dry, but don't wring the dress. Hang 
in a shady place where the sunshine will not strike it, as that fades all colors. 

To Wash Thread Lace. — Cover a bottle with white flannel, baste the lace 
carefully on the flannel, and rub with white soap; place the bottle in a jar 
filled with warm suds, let remain two or three days, changing the water 
several times, and boil with the finest white clothes on washing day ; when 
cooled a little, rinse several times in plenty of cold water, wrap a soft, dry 
towel around it, and place it in the sun; when dry, unwind, but do not 
starch. 

Black Print or Percale Dresses, that have figures of white in them, 
may be washed liicely by putting them in the " boiling suds," after the other 
clothes have all been removed, and boiling for ten minutes; cool the suds, 
rub out quickly, rinse in lukewarm water, then in very blue cold water, and 
starch in coflfee starch. Aftor the dress is dried, it is to be dipped into cold 
water, passed through the wringer, rolled in a coarse towel or sheet and left 
for a couple of hours, then ironed on the wrong side. 

To Wash DELirATE Colored Mislins. — Boil wheat bran (about two quarts 
to a dress) iii soft water half an hour, let it cool, strain the liquor, and use 
it instead of soan-suds; it removes dirt like soap, keeps the color, and the 
clothes only neeci rinsing in one water, and even stiirohing is unnecessary. 
Suds and rinsing water for coIofcmI articles should be used as cold as possible. 
Another way is to make thick corn meal mush, well salted, and use instead 
of soap; rinse in one or two waters, and do not starch. 

To vVash a Silk Dress. — To wash a silk dress with gall soap, rip apart 
and shake off the dust ; have ready two tubs warm soft water, n\ake a suds 
of the soap in one tub, and use the other for rinsing; wash tlie silk, one 
piece at a time, in the suds, wring gently, rinse, again wring, shake out, and 
iron with a hot iron on what you intend to be the wrong side. Thus pro- 
ceed with each piece; and, when about half done, throw out the suda and 
make suds of the rinsing water« using fresh water for rinsing. 



528 THE LAUNDRY. 

A Washing FLrin.— Tho washing fluid made by thev following rule is 
invaluable in cleaning woolen goods, in washing woolen tidies, or worsted 
goods df any kind: One-half bar of Babbitt's or Bell's soap, one ounce salt- 
petre, one ounce borax, four quarts soft water. Dissolve all togetlier over a 
fire; when half cold, add five ounces spirits of ammonia. The compound 
may be bottled and is good for an indefinite length of time. It is used just 
as you would use soft soap. — Mrs. Judge West, Belief ontaiiie, Ohio. 

To "Do Up" Black Silk.— Boil an old kid glove fcut up in small shreds) 
in a pint of water till the water is reduced to a half pint; then sponge the 
silk with it; fold it down tight, and ten minutes after, iron it on the wrong 
side while wet The silk will retain its softness and luster, and, at tJie 
same time, have the "body" of new silk. 

Or, rip up and brush thoroughly, then sponge in ammonia water, and 
pin out perfectly straight, each width or piece where the sun will shine on 
it and let dry. 

To TAKE OUT Scorch.. — If a shirt-bosom, or any other article has been 
scorched in ironing, lay it where bright sunshine will fall directly on it. 
Peel and slice two onions, extract the juice by pounding and squeezing; 
cut up half an ounce of tine white soap, and add to the juice; two ounces 
of fuller's earth and half pint of vinegar. Boil all together. When cool 
spread over the scorched linen, and let dry on : then wash and boil out the 
linen, and the spots will disappear unless burned so badly as to break the 
threads. 

Flour Starch. — Have a clean pan or kettle on stove with one quart boil- 
ing water, into which stir three heaping table-spoons flour, previously mixed 
smooth in little cold water; stir steadily until it boils, and then often 
enough to keep from burning. Boil about five minutes, strain while hot 
through a crash towel. The above quantity is enough for one dress, and 
will make it nice and stiffl Flour starch is considered better for all cali- 
coes than fine starch, since it makes them stiflfer, and the stiflness is longer 
retained. * 

Pocket fob Clothes-Pins. — A great convenience is the apron pocket for 
clothes pins. It takes nearly one yard of calico to make it, the apron or 
pouch l^ing fifteen inches in length, and nearly as wide. Round the cor- 
ner at the bottom. At the top. on each side of the front, two inches 
from the middle, cut out a strip nine inches long, and one and one-half 
inch wide for pocket.s. Bind them with lighter colored fabric than the 
apron, that they may be readily seen. Gather into a band and button at 
the back, or put on strings and tie. 

How TO Wash Blankets. — All that is necessary is abundance of soft water, 
and soap without resin in it. Resin hardens the fibers of wool, and should 
never be used in washing any kind of flannel goods. Blankets treated sb 
above will always come out clean and soft A little bluing may be used in 
washing white blankets. They should be shaken and snapped until almost 
dry; it will require two persons to handle them. Woolen slwwls, and all 
woolen articles, especially men's wear, are much improved by being pressed 
with a hot iron under damp muslin. 

Gall Soap. — For washing woolens, silks, or fine prints liable to fade : One 
pint beefs gall, two pounds common bar soap cut fine, one quart boiling soft 
water ; boil slowly, stirring occasionally until well mixed ; pour into a flat 
vessel, and when cold cut into pieces to dry ; or, a more simple way of using 
gall, is to get a pint lx)ttle fillea with fresh beefs gall at the butchers, cork 
tightly, add to the water when washing any material that is liable to fade; 
using more if articles are very liable to rade, and less if the liability is not 
great. When the bottle is empty or grows stale, get fresh. 

Fruit-Stains — Colored cottons or woolens stained with wine or frnitshould 
be wet in alcohol and ammonia, then sponged off gently (not rubbed) with 
alt!ohol ; after that if the material will warrant it, washed in tepid soap- 
suds. Where white are used the stains may be easily removed oy using 



THE LAUNDRY. 529 

boiling water before the stains are soaped or wetted; pour it on until they 
mostly disappear, and then let goods stand in it covered till cold. Peaches, 
flome kinds of pears, and sweet apples make the worst stains ; and if boil- 
ing water is not sufficient, a little javelle water may be used and, if skill- 
fully managed, will not need to be used often. Silks may be wet with this 
preparation when injured by these stains. 

TOE Use of Turpentine in Washing. — Turpentine should never be used 
when washing is done witli the hands, as it is very injurious to the health ; 
but when the clothes are pounded in a barrel in the old fashioned way, or 
when the rubbing is done by a washing-machine, a table-spoon of turpen- 
tine added to a pint of soft soap, taking enough of the mixture to make a 
good suds for each lot of clothes aids in removing the dirt. Care must be 
taken not to handle the turpentine with the hands, or to breathe the fumes 
of it, as it is very injurious to some persons, and great care should be taken 
to rinse the clothes very thoroughly, or the clothing may retain enough of 
the turpentine to be injuriDUs, when worn next the skin. 

To WASH Flannels in Tepid Water. — The usefulness of liquid ammonia 
is not as universally known among housewives as it deserves to be. If you 
add some of it to a soap-suds maile of a mild soap, it will prevent the flannel 
from becoming yellow or shrinking. It is the potash ana soda contained in 
sharp soap which tends to color animal fibers yellow; the shrinking may 
also be partially due to this agency, but above all to the exposure of the 
fiannel while wet to the extremes of low or high temperatures. Dipping it 
in boiling water or leaving it out in the rain will also cause it to shrink and 
become hard. To preserve their softness, flannels should be washed in tepid 
suds, rinsed in tepid water, and dried rapidly at a moderate heat. 

To Wash Lace Ruchings. — Wash with the hands in warm suds (if much 
soiled, soak in warm water two or three hours), rinse thoroughly, and starch 
in thick starch, dry out doors if the day be clear; if not, place between dry 
cloth, roll tightly and put away till dry; then, with the fingers, open each 
row and pull out smoothly (have a cup of clean water in which to dip the 
fingers or dampen the lace) ; then pull out straight the outer edge of each 
with the thumb and finger, and draw the binding over the point or .side of a 
hot iron. If the ruche is single, or onlv two rows, it can be ironed aftef . 
being smoothed (the first process). Blonde or net, that has become yellow, 
can be bleached by hanging in the sun or laying out over ni^ht in the dew. 

To MAKE Fine Starch. — Wet tlie starch smooth in a little cold water, 
in a large tin pan, pour on a quart boiling water to two or three table-spoons 
starch, stirring rapidly all the while; place on stove, stir until it boils, and 
then occasionally. Boil from five to fifteen minutes, or until the starch is 
perfectly clear. Some add a little salt, or butter or pure lard, or stir with 
a sperm candle; others add a tea-spoon kerosene to one quart starch; this 
prevents the stickiness sometimes so annoying in ironing. Either of the 
above 'ingredients is an improvement to flour starch. Many, just before 
using starch mid a little bluing. Cold starch is made from starch, dissolved 
in cold water, bein^ careful not to have it too thick; since it rots the 
clothes, it is not ailvisahle to use it — the same is true of potato starcli. 

Fob Washing the Lighter Woolen Fabrics that enter into the compo- 
sition of summer dres.ses, borax is one of the most useful articles for soften- 
ing the water and cleansing the material. This is used in the proportion of 
a table-spoon to a gallon of water, and, if dissolved in hot water, it makes a 
better lather. Of cours.e, no thoughtful fterson will attempt to wa.sh a woolen 
dress without first having ripped it apart, picked out all the threads, brushed 
the dust out, and marked t!ie particularly soiled places by running a thread 
around them. Wash one piece at a time, foil up and squeeze, or pass thn^iigh 
a wringer instead of twi.sting through the han<ls. Wash in several changes 
of borax water, and rinse in clear water, in which a well-beaten c^s has been 
mixed; shake thoroughly, and fold in sheets until evenly damp all through, 
then iron the wrong side with an ii-on hot enough to smooth nicely without 
icorchinfr 



530 THE LAUNDRY. 

Wash Silk Handkerchiefs by laving them on a smooth board, and nib- 
bing with the palm of tlie hand. Use either borax or white catstile soap to- 
make the suds; rinse in clear water, shake till nearly dry, fold evenly, 
lay between boards, and put a weight on them. No ironing is required. 
8ilk hose and ribbons may be treated in the same way ; if there are colore 
that run, put as much sugar of lead as will lie on a quarter dollar, into » 
half gallon of water, and soak the goods half an hour, stirring frequently, 
then wash as above, and rinse in several clear waters, using sugar of lead 
in the last. Or, wash in cold rain-water with a little cuni soap ; thei> 
rinse them in rain-water — cold — slifrhtly colored with stone blue ; wring 
well, and stretch them out on a mattress, tacking them out tightly. They 
will look as good ns new if carofully washed. 

Washing Light-Colored Puikts and Cambrics. — Take a table-spoon of 
alum, and dissolve it in enough lukewarm water to rinse a print dress. Dip 
the soiled dress into it, taking care to wet thoroughly every part of it, and then 
wring it out. Have warm, not hot, suds all ready, and 'wash out the dress 
quicklv; then rin?o it in cold water. (White castile soap is the best for 
colored cottons, if it can be conmianded.) Have the starcn ready, but not 
too hot ; rinse the dress in it, wring it out, and hang it wrong side out to dry, 
but not in the sun. Place it where the wind will strike it rather than the 
sijn. When dry, iron directly. Prints should never be sprinkled; but, if 
allowed to become rough dry, they should be ironed under a damp cloth.. It 
is better to wash them some* day by themselves, when washing and ironing 
can be done at once. 

To Wash Flannels in Boiling Water. — Make a strong suds of boiling 
water, and soft soap — hard soap makes flannels stiff and wiry — put them in, 
pressing them down under the water with a clothes-stick; when cool enough 
rub the articles carefully between the hands, then wrinpr — but not through 
the wringer — as dry as possible, shake, snap out, and pull each piece into its 
original size and sliape, then throw immediately into another tub of boiling 
water, in which you have thoroughly mixed some nice bluing. Shake them 
up and down in this last water with a clothes-stick until cool enough for the 
hands, then rinse well, wring, siiake out and pull into sha^)e — the snapping 
and pulling are as necessary as the washing — and hang in a sunny place 
where they will dry quickly. Many nrefer to rinse in two waters with the 
bluing in the last, ana this is always an vi.S4ible when there are many flannels. 

Care of Irons. — When irons iJecome rough or smoky, lay a little fine 
«alt on aflat surface and rub them well; it will prevent them sticking to 
any thing starched, and make them smooth ; or scour with bath-brick before 
heating, and when hot rub well with salt, and then with a small piece of 
beoswax tied up in a rag, after which wipe clean on a dry cloth. A piece 
of fine sandpaper is also a good thing to have near the stove, or a hard, 
smooth board covered with brick dust, to r^ib each iron on when it is put 
back on the stove, so tliat no starch may remain to be burnt on. Put l^ees- 
wax between pieces of paper or cloth and keep on the table close by the 
flat-iron stand. If the irons get coated with scorched starch, rub them over 
the paper that holds the beeswax and it will all come off. Rubbing the iron 
over the waxed paper, even if no starch adheres, adds to the glossiness of the 
linen that is ironed. 

Washing Lace.— To make the starch properly, mix the dry particles with 
enough cold water to make a smooth jtaste, add cold water until it looks 
like milk and water, and boil it in a smoothly glazed earthen vessel until it 
is perfectly transparent. While it is cooling squeeze the laces through a 
soap-snds,* and rinse them in clear water. If you wish them clear white, add 
a little bluing; if ivory white, omit the bluing, and if yellow-tinged add a 
few teaspoons clear coffee to the starch. Run through the starch, saueeLv*, 
roll up in towels, and clap each piece separately until dry: pull gently into 
shape, from time to time, with the finger. •> and pin on the ironing taole or 
bosom-board or upon the pillows in the •' spare " bedroom. When dry. 



THE LAUNDRY. 531 

press between tissue paper with a hot iron, punch the openings with an 
ivory stiletto, and pick each pearl or loop on the edge with a coarse pin 
until it looks like new lace. 

Lawn and Muslin Dresses that have faded may be whitened in the boiling 
suds, and bleached on the grass, and. when done up, are quite as pretty as 
dresses made of new white material. Delicate hued muslin and cambric 
dresses may be washed nicely by the follow^ing process: Shave half a pound 
of common hard soap into a gallon of boiling water; let it melt, turn it into 
a tub of lukewarm water ; stir a quart of wlieat bran into a second tub of 
lukewarm water, and have ready a third tub with clear water; put the dress 
into the first tub of suds, rub gently, or rather "souse" it up and down, and 
squeeze it out; treat it the sanie in the tub of bran water; rinse, dry and dii> 
in starch made the same as for shirts ; dry a^in, and then rinse tlioroughl y 
in clear water; dry again, and sprinkle with a whisk-broom or sprinkler; 
roll up in a thick cloth while the iron gets hot, and iron with them as hot as 
they can be used without scorching the dress. By taking a clear day, it is 
little trouble to do several dresses in a few hours. 

To Remove Grease fi^om Silk, Cotton, Linen or Worsted Goods. — 
Rub magnesia freely on both sides of silk or worsted goods and hang away. 
Benzine, ether or soap will take out spots from silk, but remember the goods 
must not be rubbed. Oil of turpentine or benzine will remove spots of 
paint, varnish or pitch from white or colored cotton or woolen goods. After 
using it, they should be washed in soap-suds. Spots from sperm candles, 
stearine, and the like, should be softened and removed • by ninety-five per 
cent, alcohol, then sponged off with a weak alcohol, and a small quantity of 
ammonia added to it. Holding white cotton or linen over the fumes of 
burniitg sulphur, and wetting in warm chlorine water, will take out wine or 
fruit stains. The sooner the remedy is applied, after any of these spots or 
stains are discovered, the more effectual the restoration. ' From white linen 
or cotton by soap-suds or weak lye, and from calicoes with warm soap-suds. 
From woolens by soap-suds or ammonia. On silks use either yolk of egg 
with water, magnesia, ether, benzine, ammonia, or French chalk.* 

To Press and Clean Silks. — All satin goods should be pressed upon the 
ri^ht side. To press and clean black silk, shake out all the dust, clean well 
with a flannel cloth, rubbing it up and down over the silk : this takes out 
all dust that may be left; take some good lager beer and sponge the silk, 
both on the wrong and right side, sponging across the width of the silk, 
and not down the length, and with a moderately-warm iron, press what is 
intended for the wrong .side. After sponging, it is better to wait a few 
minutes before pressing, as the irons will not be so apt to stick. 

Or, sponge with hot coffee, thoroughly freed from sediment by being 
strained through muslin. The silk is sponged on the side intended to show, 
it is allowed to become partially dry, and then ironed on the wrong side. 
The coffee removes every particle of grease, and restores the brilliancy of 
flilk. without giving it eitncr the shiny appearance or crackly or papery 
stiffness obtained by beer or any other liquid. The silk appears thickened 
bj' the process, and this good effect remains. 

To Make Hard Soap. — Place one gallon of good soft soap in a kettle to 
boil ; when it begins to boil, stir in a pint measure level full of common 
salt, stirring it all the time until the salt is dissolved, then set to cool. 
Next day, cut out the soap in squares, vscrape off the soft, dark part, that 
adheres to the lower side of the cakes, pour out the lye, and wash the ket- 
tle; place the soap, cut in thin slices in the kettle, with more weak !ye. 
If the lye is strong add rain-water, pint for pint; let it boil until the soap 
■is dissolved. While boiling, again stir in a pint measure level full of sail, 
stirring it some as before, and set to cool. When perfectly hanl, cut it in 
cakes tlie size you wish, scraping off the soft lye part that adheres to the 
lower side, and lay on boards, top side down in the sun, turning it each 
day until sufficiently dry. Or, if you wish to make a twelve or four^ 



532 THE LA US DRY. 

teen gallon kettle of soft soap into hard, three quarts of salt, stirred In each 
time, will be suthcicnt. But as soapdiflfers in strength, the quantity of salt 
must also (lifTiT. Tiie stronger the soap the more salt is requinnl. A good 
general rule is our old grandmother's: "When tlie stmp is iMjiling. stir in 
salt until it curdles and becomes whitish in color." It can be tested by 
placing some in a shallow pan to co«j1, as it cools in a few minutes sum- 
ciently to know if enough salt is in. 

To Bleach Mitslin. — For thirty yards of muslin, take one pound of chlo- 
ride of lime, dissolve in two quarts rain-water; let cloth soak over night in 
warm rain-water, or long enough to be thoroughly wet; wring out cloth 
and put in another tub of warm ruin-water in wliich the chloride of lime 
solution has been pourod. Let it remain for alxiut twenty minutes, lifting 
up the cloth and airing evury few minutes, and rinse in clear rain-water. 
This will not injure the vUtih in the least, and is much less troublesome 
than bleaching on the grass. 

Or, scnld in suds and lay them on the clean gra.<5s all night, or if this. 
can not be done, bring in and place in a tub of clean soft water. In the 
morning scald again and put out as before. It will take from one to two 
weeks to bleach white. May be bleached in winter by placing on the snow. 
Mav is the best month for bleaching. To whiten yelfow linens or muslins, 
soak over-night, or longer, in buttermilk ; rinse thoroughly and wash thcF 
same as other clothes. This will also answer for light calicoes, percales, 
lawns, etc., that will not fade. Some use sour milk when not able to pro- 
cure buttermilk. To whiten yellow laces, old collars, etc., put in a glass 
bottle or jar in a' strong suds* let stand in sun for seven days, shaking oc- 
casitmally. 

To Wash Lace Curtains. — Shake the dust well out of the lace, fiut in 
tepid water, in which a little soda has been dissolved, and wash at once care- 
fully with the hands in several waters, or until perfectly clean; rin.se in 
water well blued, also blue, the boiled starch quite deeply and squeeze, but 
do not wring. Pin some sheets down to the carpet in a vacant, airy room, 
then pin on the curtains stretched to exactly the size they were before being 
wet. In a few hours thejr will be drv and ready to put up. The whole pro- 
cess of washing and pinning down should occupy as little time as j)ossiole, 
as lace will shrink more than any other cotton goods when long wet. Above 
all, it should not be allowed to '**soak" from the mistaken idea that it washes 
more ea-sily, nor should it ever be ironed. Another way is to fasten them in 
a pair of frames, which every housekeeper should have, made very like the 
old-fashioned quil ting-frames, thickly studded along the inside with the 
smallest size of galvanized tenter hooks, in which to fasten the lace, and hav- 
ing holes and wooden pins with which to very the length and breadth to suit 
the dilTercnt sizes of curtains. The curtains should always be measured 
before being wet, and stretched in the frames to that size to prevent shrink- 
ing. Five or six curtains of the same size may be j»ut in, one above the 
other, and all dried at once. The frames may rest on four chairs. 

How TO i>o vp Shirt-Bosoms. — To fine starch add a piece of "Enamel" 
the size of a hazel-nut; if this is not at hand use a table-spoon gum-arabic 
solution (made by pouring boiling water ui)()n gum-arabic and standing un- 
til clear and transparent), or a piece of clean mutton-tallow half the size of 
a nutmeg and a tea-spoon of salt will do, but is not as good. Strain the 
starch througli a strainer or a piece of thin muslin. Have the sliirt turned 
wrong side out; dip the bosoms carefully in the fine starch, made according 
to recij>e, and squeeze out, repeating the operation until the bosoms are 
thoroughly and evenly saturated with starcn; proceed to dry. Three hours 
before ironing dip the bosoms in clean water; wring out and roll up tightly. 
First iron the back by folding it lengthwise through the center; next iron the 
wristbands, and both sides of the sleeves; then the collar-band; now place 
the bosom-board under the bosom, and with a dampened napkin rub the 
bosom from the top towards the bottom, smoothing and arranging each plait

neatly. With smooth, moderately hot flat-iron, begin at the top and Iron 
downwards, and continue the operation until the bosom is perfectly dry and 
shining. Remove the bosom-board, and iron the front of the shirt. The 
bosoms and cuffs of shirts, indeed of all nice fine work, will look clearer 
and better if they are first ironed under a piece of thin old muslin. It takes 
off the first heat of the iron, and removes any lumps of starch. 

Washing Fluid. — The very best known, as it saves time, labor, clothes 
and soap : One pound sal-soda, one-half pound stone lime, five quarts soft 
water, (some add one-fifth pound borax); boil a short time in copper or 
brass kettle, stirring occasionally, let settle and pour off the clear tluiu into 
a stone jug, and cork for use ; soak white clothes over night in simple water, 
wring out and soap wristbands, collars, and dirty stained places ; have boiler 
half filled with water, and when at scalding heat put in one common tea- 
cup of fluid, stir and put in clothes, and boil half an hour, rub lightly 
through one suds only, rirysing well in the bluing water as usual, and. all 
is complete. Instead or soaking clothes over night, they may soak in suds 
for a lew hours before beginning washing. For each additional boiler of 
clothes, add half a cup only of the fluid, of course boiling in the same water 
through the whole washing. If more water is needed in the boiler for the 
last clothes, dip it from the sud.sing tub. This fluid brightens instead of 
fading the colors in calico, and is good for colored flannels. It does not rot 
clothes, but they must not lie long in t/ie water; tlie boiling, sudsing^ rinsing and 
bluing mttst follow each other in rapid snxcessiony until clothes are hun^ on the 
line, whichshould be by ten o'clock in the morning. Sonie of this fluid, 
put in hot water, is excellent for removing grease spots from the floor, doors 
and windows; also for cleansing tin- ware, pots, and Kettles. — Mrs. Rose Sharp, 
Kingston, 0. 

To Wash Woolen Goods. — Dissolve a large table-spoon borax in a pint 
boiling water. Mix one-quarter of it in the cold water in which greasy 
woolen goods are to be washed. Put in one piece at a time, using soap, if 
needed; and if necessary add more of the borax -water. Wash and rinse in 
cold water. Shake welland hang where the goods will dry quickly. 

Flannels can be washed in the same way. The important thing in wash- 
ing flannels is to have all waters of the same temperature. If you begin 
with cold, go through with cold ; if with hot, have all waters equally hot. They 
must not be allow^ed to freeze in (frying. Some add a little salt to the last 
rinsing water. In washing flannels be careful that the soap used has no resin 
in it. When flannels are nearly dry, take in, fold carefully, roll up in a 
damp cloth so that they will iron smoothly. 

In ironing heavy woolen goods, especially pants, vests, etc., it is well to 
le*. them get dried, th?n spread them out on an ironing-board (not on a 
table), wring-a cloth out or clear water and lay over the article, tlien iron 
with a hot iron till dry; wet the cloth again and spread it just above the 
part already ironed, but let it come a half inch or so on that which has been 
pressed, so that there will be no line to mark where the cloth was moved, 
continue this till the whole garment lias been thoroughly pressed. Woolen 
garments thus ironed will look like new; but in doing this«care must be 
exercised that every spot that Icjoks at all "fulled" or shrunk should be 
stretched while being pressed under the wet cloth. Bring the outsiilc to fit 
the linings, as when new, but if not (jviite able to do this, rip the lining and 
trim off to match. All the seams, es})orially on pants, must be first pressed 
on a** press board," then fold the pants as they arc found in the tailor's 
shop, and go over them with the wet cloth and hot iron. 

To Dry-starcii, Fold and lRf>x Shirts. — In doing up shirts, wrist- 
bands and collars should be starched first if the collars are sewed on. Dip 
them into the hot starch, and as soon as the hand can bear the heat (and 
dipping the hand in cold water often will expedite the work) rub the starch 
in very thoroughly, taking care that no motes or lumps of starch adhere to 
the linen. Then starch the shirt-bosom the same wa}**, keeping the starch 



534 THE LAUNDRY, 

hot all the time bv setting* the dish in a deep pan of water. Rub it into the 
linen very carefully, puss the finger under the plaits and raise them up so that 
the stiircii slmll i)enetrate all through evenly. Some rub it into the plaits 
with a piece of clean linen, but we think the hand does the work more thor- 
oughly and evenly. When perfectly starched, shake out tlie shirt evenly. 
Cold both sides of the bosom together and bring the shoulders and siae 
seams together evenly ; that will lay tlie sleeves one over the other, and after 
pulling the wristbands into shape smoothly they can thus l)e folded together 
and the wristbands rolled tightlyand, with the sleeves, be folded and laid 
even on the sides of the shirt. Then turn the sides with the sleeves tner 
on the front, and l>eginiung at the neck roll the whole tightly together, 
wrap in u towel and let it remain so several hours before ironing — all night 
if starched and folded in the evening — and in the summer put in a cool 
place where the starch will not sour, and in the winter keep warm enough 
to prevent freezing. To do up shirt-bosoms iif the most perfect wav. one 
must have a " |K>lishin^ iron — a small iron rounded over and high fy pol- 
ished on the ends and sides. Spread the bosom on a hard and very sinoofh 
board, with only one thickness oi cotton cloth sewed tight across it. Spread 
a wet cloth over and iron quickly with a hot iron, tnen remove the cloth 
and with a poli.shing iron as hot as it can be used without scorching, rub 
the bosom quick and hard up and down, not crosswise. Use only the 
rounded part oi* the front of tne iron, that puts all the friction on a small 
part at one time, and gives the full benent of all the gloss in starch or 
linen. — Mrs. Beecher^ in Christian Union. 

iSoAP FOR Family Use. — Much of the toilet and laundry soaps in the 
market are adultenited with injurious, and, to some persons, poisonous sub- 
tances, by which diseases of the skin are occasioned or grcatl3' aggravated, 
and great sutfering results, which is rarely traced to the real cause. The fat 
tried from animals which have died of disease, if not thoroughly saponified, 
is poisonous, and sometimes produces death. If in making soap the mass is 
heated to too high a degree, a lilm of soap forms around the particles of fat; 
if at this stage resin, sal-soda, silicate, and other adulterations are added, the 
fat is not saponified, but filmed, and if poisonous or diseased, it so remains, 
and is dangerous to use. A bar of such soap has an oil^ feeling, and is 
unfit for use. If it feels sticky, it has too much resin in it. The slippery 
feeling which belongs to soap properly made can not be mistaken. Another 
test of pure soft or hard soap is its translucent or semi-transparent appear- 
ance. Soft soap that is cloudy is not thoroughly saponified, or else has oeen 
made of dirty or impure grease. It is not only safer but more economical 
to buy pure soap, as the adulterations increase tlie quantity without adding 
to the erasive ixiwer. Some of the brown soaps sola in the market are sev- 
enty-five percent, resin, and the buyer gets only twenty-five per cent of what 
he wants for his money. Fifteen per cent of resin improves the quality, but 
any excess damages it, and is worse than useless. Almost any ramily may 
make excellent soft soap with very little expense by saving grease,^nd using 
lye from pure hard wood ashes or pure potash. Never use concentrated lye. 

To set the leach^ bore several auger holes in the bottom of a barrel ; or 
use one without a bottom; prepare a board larger than the barrel, set barrel 
on it, and cut a groove arouna just outside the barrel, making one groove 
from this to the edge of the board to carry off the lye as it runs off, with a 

? groove around it, running into one in the center of the board. Place two 
eet from the ground, and tip so that the lye may run easily from the board 
into the vessel below prepared to receive it. Put half-bricks or stones 
around the edge of insine of barrel, place on them one end of sticks one or 
two inches wide, inclining to the center; place straw to the depth of two 
inches, over it scatter two p)unds slacked lime ; put in the ashes aoout a half 
bushel at a time, pack well by using a pounder, spade, or common ax ; con- 
tinue to pack until barrel is full, leaving a funnel-snaped hollow in the center 
large enough to hold several quarts of water. Use soft or rain-water, and 



THE LAUNDRY. 535 

boiling hot. I>et the first water disappear before adding more. If the ashes 
are packed very tightly, it may require two or three days before the lye will 
begin to run» but it is much better as it will be stronger. If a large quantity 
of lye is needed, prepare a board long enough to hold two or more barrels, 
one back of the other, with a groove in the center the entire length of the 
board ; on this place the barrels prepared as above. 

Sun or Cold Soap is made by adding one pound of cleansed grease, 
spoiled lard or butter, to each gallon of lye strong enough to float an egg. 
Set the vessel in the sun and stir thoroughly each day until it is good soap. 
This gives it a golden color, and produces an exceHont soap for washing. It 
inay be used in washing even laces and fine cambrics with perfect safety. 

To cleanse grease. -^Vlace all grease of whatever kind, soup Ixmes, hani- 
rinds, cracklings, or any refuse fat into a kettle, with weak lye enough to 
boil it until all the particles of fat are extracted ; let it cool, then skim off 
the grease, which is now ready to make the *' Sun Soap.'* I would add here 
that no fat should be put away for soap grease until fried thoroughly. 

Boiled Soap. — ^There is no romance or poetry in making boiled soap, only 
patient hard work; yet w^ithout this useful article, what an unpresentable 
people we should be. Place the grease, consisting of soup-bones and all 
Kinds of fat that accumulate in a kitchen, in a kettle, filling it only half full ; 
if there is too much fat, it can be skimmed off after the soap is cold, for 
another kettle of soap. This is the only true test when enough fat is used, 
as the lye will consume all that is needed and no more. Make a fire under 
one side of it. The kettle should be in an out-house or out of doors. Let 
it heat very hot so as to fry, and stir it to prevent burning; now put in the 
lye, a gallon at the time, watch closely until it boils, as it iM^metimes runs 
over at the beginning. Add lye until the kettle is full enough, but not too 
full, to boil well. Soap should boil from the side and not the middle, as 
this would be more likely to cause it to boil over. To test the soap, to one 
spoonful of soap add one of rain-water; if it stirs up very thick, the soap is 
good and will keep; if it becomes thinner, it is unfit for use. 

This is the result of one of three causes: it is too weak, there is a deposit 
of dirt, or it is too strong. Continue to boil for a few hours, when it should 
flow from the stick with which it is stirred, like thick molasses ; but if after 
boiling it remains thin, let it stand over night, removing the fire, then drain 
very carefully into another vessel, being particular to prevent any sediment 
frorn passing. Wash the kettle, return the soap and bring to a boil, and if 
the cause was dirt, it will now be thick and good, otherw^ise it is too strong 
and needs rain-water added. * This can safely be done by jwuring in a small 
quantity at a time, until it becomes thick. These are the usual causes that 
arise to trouble soap-makers. If other difficulties appear, they must use 
good common sen.se to meet and overcome them. 

It might not be amiss to add to this, the most economical way of saving 
soap grease. Have a kettle standing in the yard in summer time (or if there 
is not a yard, in cellar), and as you save a little grease put it in, but do not 
put in raw grease. If there are* any pieces of fat left after using a hnni or 
lumps of suet not used in C(X)king a steak, put them in a skillet and fry them 
brown, then put all into the kettle of lye; thus every particle of fat will be 
saved, and no fear of insects, rats or nlice getting into and destroying the 
grease. Keep the kettle covered during night or when raining, but un- 
covered in the sunshine, stirring occasionally. In the fall, all that is neces- 
sary is to make a fire under the kettle, and' let it boil a short time, adding 
more lye or grease if needed. If there are too many bones in it, or any par- 
ticles that have not become consumed, skim them out and put them in a |)0t 
of weak, hot lye, .stirring them with the skimmer to rinse off all the soap, then 
skim out and throw away, and the pot of lye which has become almost soap, 
may now be added to the kettle of good soap. A few beef bones left ih the 
barrel will sink to the bottom, and are said by some good housewives to 
improve the soap. Soft soap should be kept in a dry place in cellar, and is 
better if allowea to stand three months before using. 



THE CELLAR AND ICE-HOUSE. 



The cellar, when properly constructed and cared for, is the most usefdl 
room in the house, and no dwelling is complete without one. It is economy 
of expense and ground-space to build it under ground, and this plan gives 
the best cellar whenever the site of the house permits thorough drainage. 
The base of the foundation-wall of the house should be laid a little below 
the floor-level of the cellar, and the first layer should be of broad flag-stones, 
80 placed that the edges will project a few inches beyond the outer face of 
the walL This eflectually prevents rats from undermining the cement floor, 
"which they often do when this precaution is neglected, digging away the dirt 
until the floor breaks and gives them access to a new depot of supplies. In 
burrowing downwards, they invariably keep close to the wall, and when they 
reach the projecting flagging, give it up and look for an easier job. To secure 
the cellar from freezing, the wall, above the level of the deepest frost, should 
be double or "hollow^,*' the inner wall being of brick four inches thick, with 
an air-space of two inches between it and the outer wall, which should be of 
stone and twelve or fourteen inches thick. The brick wall should be stiff- 
ened by an occasional ** binder" across to the stone. The hollow space may 
be filled with dry tan-bark or sawdust, or left simply filled with tlie confined 
air, "dead air" being the most perfect non-conductor of heat known. The 
windows, which should be opposite each other when possible, to secure a 
"draft" and more perfect ventilation, should be provided with double sash 
<^one flush with the outer face of the wall, which may be removed in sum- 
mer, and the other flush with the inner face, hung on strong hinges, so that 
It may easily be swung open upward and hooked there. In winter, this 
arrangement lets in light, but with its space of confined air, keeps out the 
frost. A frame covered with wire netting should take the place of the outer 
sash in summer, to keep out every thing but the fresh air and light. The 
walls should be as smooth as possible on the inner side, and neatly plastered; 
also the ceiling overhead. The floor should be first paved w^ith small stones, 
then a coat of water-lime laid on, and over this a second coat, as level as a 
planed floor. Tl\/ere should also be double doors, one flush with each 
face of the wall ; and a wide out-door stairway, through which vegetables, 
coal, etc., may be carried, is indispensable. The depth should be about eight 
feet. 

Such a cellar may always be clean, the air pure, and the temperature 
junder complete control. It will consequently keep apples and pears two or 
threfe months longer than an ordinary cellar, prolonging the fruit season to 
"strawberry- time." If it extends under the whole house — the best plan 
when the state of the purse permits it — it may be divided into apartments, 
(536) 



THi: CELLAR AND ICE-HOUSE, 537 



I 



with brick walls between — one for vegetables, one for fruits, one for provis- 
ions, one for the laundry, and a fifth for coal and the furnace, if one is used. 
In one corner of the cellar, under the kitchen, may also be the cistern, the 
strong cellar wall serving for its outer wall. A pump from the kitchen 
would supply water tliere for domestic uses ; and a pipe with a stop-cock, 
leading through the wall into the cellar, would occasionally be a conven- 
ience and save labor. It is better, however, as a rule, to locate the cistern 
just outside the house, passing a pi|)e from it through the cellar wall below 
the deepest frost level, and thence to the kitchen. If built in the cellar, tlic 
cistern should be square, with heavy walls, plastered inside with three coats 
of water-lime. 

All the apartments of a cellar should be easily accessible {rom the outside 
door and from the kitchen stairway. In the vegetable apartment, the bins 
should be made of dressed luml>er, and painted, and located in the center, 
with a walk around each, so that the contents may easily be examined and 
assorted. The fruit shelves, made of slats two inches wide and placed one 
inch apart, should be put up with equal care and neatness, and with equal 
regard for convenience and easy access. Their plaoe should be the most airy 
part of the cellar ; the proper width is about two feet, and the distance apart 
about one foot, witli the lowest shelf one foot from the floor. Pears will 
ripen nicely on the lower shelves under a cover of woolen blankets. The 
supports should, of course, be firm and strong. The bottom shelf sliouid be 
of one board, on which to scatter fine fresh lime to the depth of an inch, 
changing it two or three times during the winter. A shelf, suspended firmly 
from the ceiling, and located where it will be easy of access from the kitchen, 
on which to place cakes, pies, meats, and any thing that needs to be kept 
cool and safe from cats and mice, is an absolute necessity. Its height pre- 
vents t!ie articles placed on it from becoming damp, and gathering mold, as 
they sometimes do when placed on Uie cellar floor. In planning shelves for 
cans, crocks, casks, etc., regard should be had to economy of space by making 
the distance between the shelves correspond to the articles to stand on them, 
and it is well to so place the lower shelf that the meat barrels, etc., may be 
placed under it. The temperature of a cellar should never be below freezing, 
and if it is raised aljove fifty by a fire, outside air should be admitted to 
lower it. The best time for ventilating the cellar is at noon, taking care in 
hot weather not to admit so much outside air as to render it warm. A sim- 
ple and excellent plan for ventilation, where the location of the kitchen 
chimney admits it, is to pass an ordinary stove-pipe through the floor upward 
beside or behind the pipe of the kitclien stove, and thence by an elbow into 
the chimney. The draft of the cliimney will carry off all the impure air 
that arises in the cellar, and if too great a current is created, it may be brought 
under complete control by a valve at the floor. 

The cellar must be frequently examined and kept perfectly sweet and 
clean. There is no reason why it should not be as neat as the living rooms, 
and as free from cobwebs, decayed fruit and vegetables, and all other forms 
of lilthiness. Whitewashing walls in winter will aid iu giving it tidiness. 
34 



538 THE ICE-HOUSE. 

If the cellar is constructed.abovc ground, the entire walls should be double, 
with air space between, double windows and doors being even more necessary 
than when under-ground. Above all, the lloor should be on a level with 
that of the kitchen, to save the woman-killing stairs. If there are stairs, let 
them be broad, firm, and placed in the light if possible. Of course, every 
cellar should have thorough dniinage. In laying a tile drain, if in the horse- 
shoe form, place the circular side down ; the narrower the channel, the swifter 
the current and more certain to carry off sediment. 

THE STOBE-ROOM. 

A clean, tidy, well-arranged store-room is one sign of a good methodical 
housekeeper. When stores are put away at hap-hazard. and taken out at any 
time and in any quantit}', disorder and extravagance prevail. A store-room 
ought to be large, airy, cool, and dry. Such a room is not always to be had, 
but even if a closet has to be put up with, it may be kept clean. Shelves 
should be ranged around the walls, hooks fastened to the edges of the shelves. 
The driest and coolest part of the rooms should be kept for jams, jellies, and 
pickles. All the jars should be distinctly labeled at the front, so that they 
will not all need to be taken down every time a particular jar is wanted 
Biscuits or cakes should be kept in closely covered tin boxes ; lemons should 
be huug in nets. Soap should be bought in large quantities, and cut up in 
convenient-sized pieces, so that it may be dry before it is used. Coffee, when 
roasted, should b^ kept in small quantities; if unroasted. it will improve 
with keeping. Stores on no account £ihould be left in the papers in which 
they were sent from the grocer's, but should be put \\\U) tin canisters or 
earthenware jars closely covered, and each jar, like tlie jam, should be labeled. 
Stores should be given out regularly, either daily or weekly. In order to 
check their consumption, the housekeeper will do well to keep in the store- 
room a memorandum book, with a pencil fastened to it, and in this book sbe 
should enter the date on which all stores were brought in or taken out. By 
means of the.se memoranda she can compare one week's outgo with another, 
and immediately discover any extravagance. A hammer, a few nails, a little 
gum, a ball of string, a few sheets of foolscap, and a pair of scissors, should 
always be kept in the store-room. 

THE ICE-HOrSE. 

Ice is one of the greatest of summer luxuries, and indeed is almost a nece»- 
Mty. It is so easily put up, even in the country, and so cheaply protected, 
that there is no reason why any one who is able to own or rent a house may 
not have it in liberal supply. A cheap ice-house may be made by parti- 
tioning off a space about twelve feel square in the wood-shed, or even in the 
barn. The roof must be tight over it, but there is no necessity for matched 
or fine lumber for the walls. They should, however, be coated with coal-tar 
inside, as the long-continued moisture puts them to a severe test and brings 
on decay. Ice should be taken from still places in running streams, or from 
clear ponds. It may be cut with half an old cross-cut saw, but there are 
saws and ice-plows made for the purpose to be had in almost ever}' village. 



KEEPING FRUITS AM) VEGETABLES. 539 

In cutting ice, as soon as it is of suffici«it thickness and before much warm 
weather, select a still day, with the thermometer as near zero as may be. Ice 
handles much more comfortably and easily when it is so cold that it imme' 
diately freezes dry, thus preventing the wet clothes and mittens, which are 
the sole cause of any suffering in handling it ; and ice put up in sharp, cold 
weather, before it has been subjected to any thaw, will keep much better and 
be much more useful in the hot days of summer than if its packing had been 
delayed until late winter or early spring, and then the ice put up half melted 
and wet. The l^st simple contrivance for removing blocks of ice from the 
wat^r is a plank with a cleat nailed across one end, which is to be slipped 
under the block, which slides against the eleat, and may then be easily drawn 
out with the plank, without lifting. Cut the ice in large blocks of equal 
size, pack as closely as possible in layers, leaving about a foot space between 
the outside and the wall, and filling all crevices between the blocks with 
pounded ice or sawdust. Under the first layer there should be placed saw- 
dust a foot thick, and arrangements should be made for thorough drainage, as 
water in contact with the ice will melt it rapidly. As the layers are put in 
place, pack sawdust closely between the mass of ice and the wall ; and when 
all is stored, cover with a foot, at least, of sawdust In using ice, be careful 
to cover all crevices with sawdust, as the ice will melt rapidly if exposed to 
the air. The less ventilation and the more completely an ice-house is kept 
closed, the better the ice will keep. The cold air which surrounds the ice, if 
undisturbed by currents, has little effect on it; but if there are openings, cur- 
rents are formed and the warm air is brought in to replace the cold. This is 
especially the case if the openings are low, as the cold air, being the heavier, 
passes out below most readily. For this reason great care must be taken to 
fill in fresh saw-dust between the walls and the mass of ice, as it settles down 
by its own weight, 'and the melting of the ice. There is no advantage in 
having an ice-house wholly or partly under ground, if it is constructed as di- 
rected above. Fine chaff, or straw cut fine, may be substituted for sawdust 
when the latter is difficult to obtain. Of course, the building may be con- 
structed separately, in which case the cost need not be more than twenty-five 
to fifty-dollars. 

Cranberries — will keep all winter in a keg of water. 

Celery — keeps well buried in dry sand. 

Onions — keep best when spread over the floor. 

To KEEP Turnips. — When buried deep in the earth they will keep solid 
until March or April. 

To KEEP Lemons. — Cover with cold water, changing it every week. This 
makes them more juicy. 

Parsnips and salsify should be left in the ground all winter, unless the 
climate is very severe, when they may be buried in a deep pit in the garden, 
and not opened until March or April. 

To keep Parsley fresh and gp.skn. — Put it in a strong boiling hot 
nickle of salt and water, and keep for use. Hang up and dry in bunches, 
Dlossom downward, in a dry attic or store-room, for use in soups, stuffing, etc. 

Whitewash for Cellars. — An ounce of carbolic acid to a gallon of 
whitewash will keep from cellars the disagreeable odor which taints milk 
and meat. Or, add copperas to ordinary whitewash until it is yellow ; the 
copperas is a disinfectant, and drives away vermin. 



540 KEEPING FEUJT8 AND VEGETABLES. 

To KEEP Cellar clean. — Remove |i11 vegetables as soon as they begin 
to decay, and ventilate well so that the walls will not become foul. Use 
chloride of lime as a disinfectant freely, after taking care to make it as neat 
and clean ns iM>ssible. 

All kinds of Hkrbs. — Gather on a dry day, just before or while in 
blossom, tie in bundles, blositoni downward. ^Vhen perftcily dry, wrap the 
medicinal ones in paper, and keep from air. Pick ot!' the leaves' of those to 
be u.sed in cooking, pound, sift them tine, and cork up tijjhlly in l)ottIe8. 

Keepinu Cabbages. — When the weather becomes fio.>iy,' cut tlieni off 
near the head, and carry them, with the leaves on, to a dry cellar, break off 
superHuous leaves, and pack into a light cask or box, stems iipward. and when 
nearly full cover with loose leaves; secure the box with a lid against rats. 

Tot atoes — should be kept in a cool, dark place. When old, and likely to 
sprout, put them in a basket and lower them into boiling water, for a niiihite 
or two, let them dry and put away in sacks. This destroys the germ, and 
the ix)tatoes retain their flavor until late. 

The Temperature^ — Vegetables kivp best at as low a temperature as 
possible without freezing. Apples bear a very low temperature. Sweet po- 
tatoes (which keep well packed in dry forest leaves) require a dry, warm 
atmosphere. S<iuashes should be kept ifl a dry place, as cool as possible 
without freezing. 

Keeping Tease for winter tse. — Shell, throw into boiling water with a 
little salt, boil five or six minutes, drain in a colander and afterwards on a 
cloth, until completely dried, and place in air-tight bottles. Some use wide- 
mouthed bottles, not quite filling them, j)ouring over fried mutton fat so as 
to cover the pease, and cork tightly, securing the cork with resin or sealing- 
wax. When used, boil until tender, and season with butter. 

To KEEP Apples. — Apples are usually kept on oi>en shelves, easily ac- 
cessible, so that the decaying ones may easily be removed. They are .some- 
times packed in layers of dry sand, care beintr taken not to let them touch 
each other, with good results. When they begin to decay, pick out those 
which are speckled, stew them up with cider and supir. and till all empty 
self-sealing truit-cans, and keep the sauce for use hue m the season. Or pack 
in dry saw-dust, or any grain, as oats, barley, etc., so that they will not touch 
each other; or if fruit is tine, wrap each apple in ]iaper and pack in boxes. 

To keep Grapes. — A barrel boon suspended from the ceiling by three 
cords, from which graj)e stems are luuig by means of wire hooks attached to 
the small end. sealing the other with hot sealing-wax, each stem free from 
contact with its neighbors, is said to be the l)est contrivance for keeping 
grapes. The imperfect grapes must l>e removed, and the room must be free 
from frost, and not dry enough to wither them or too moist. The simplest 
way to keep grapes is' to place them in drawers holding about twenty-tive 
pounds each, piling the boxes one over another. 

Packing Vegetables. — For present use they should be laid aw^ay care- 
full v in a bin with a close lid {hung on hinges) so that the light nuiy be ex- 
chided. To keep them for a longer time, the best plan is to pull them on a 
dry day, cut off tlie tops and trim, and pack them in clean barrels or boxes, 
in layers with fnie clean m<)s.s, such as is found in abundance in woods, be- 
tween them. The moss keeps them clean and sufficiently moist, preventing 
shriveling of the roots on the one hand, and absorbing any excels of damp- 
ness on the otlier. 

Keeping. Cabbages in the Country. — Take up the cabbages by the roots, 
set closely together in rows, up to the hea<l in soil, roots down as they 
grew ; drive in posts at the corners of the bed, and at intermediate points if 
necessary, higher on one side than the otlier; nail strips of lioanls on the 
posts and lay upon these old boards, d<x)rs, or if nothing else is at hand, bean- 
poles, and corn fodder, high enough so that the roof wi'.] be clear of the 
cabbages, and allow the air to circulate ; close up the sides with yard or gar- 
den offal of any kind, and the cabbages will keep fresh and green all winter, 
and be accessible at all times. Exclude moisture but never mind the fiost. 



SOMETHING ABOUT BABIES. 



A child's first right rs to be well born, of parents sound in body and mind, 
who can boast a long line of ancestors on both sides; an aristocracy, based 
on the cardinal virtues of purity, chastity, sobriety, and honesty. 

If the thought, the money, the religious enthusiasm, now expended for 
the regeneration of tlie race, were wisely directed to the generation of our 
descendants, to the conditions and environments of parents and children, the 
whole face of society might be changed before we celebrate the next Cen> 
tennial of our national life. 

All religious, educational, benevolent, and industrial societies combined, 
working harmoniously together, can not do as much in a life-time of effort, 
toward the elevation of mankind, as can parents in the nine months of pre* 
natal life. Locke took the ground that the mind of every child born into 
the world is like a piece of blank paper, that you may write thereon what- 
ever you will ; but science proves that such idealists as Descartes were nearer 
right when they declared that each soul comes freighted with its own ideas, 
its individual proclivities; that the pre*natal influences do more in the form- 
ation of character than all tlie education that come after. 

Let the young man, indulging in all manner of excesses, remember that 
in considering the effect of dissipation, wine, and tobacco, on himself and his 
own happiness or misery, he does not begin to measure the evil of his life 
As the Higii Priest at the family altar, his deeds of darkness will entail 
untold suffering on generation after generation. Let the young woman with 
wasp-like waist, who lives on candies, salads, hot brea<l, pastry, und pickles^ 
whose listless brain and idle hands seek no profitable occupation, whose life 
is given to folly, remember that to her ignorance and folly may yet be traced 
the downfall of a nation. 

One of the most difficult lessons to impress on any mind is the power and 
extent of individual influence; and parents above all others, resist the belief 
that their children are exactly what they make them ; no more, no less; like 
producing like. If there is a class of educators who need special prepara- 
tion for their high and holy calling, it is those who assume the responsiiiility 
of parents. Shall we give less thought to the creation of an immortal being 
than the artist devotes to his statue or landscape^ We wander through the 
art galleries in the old world, and linger before the works of the great mas- 
ters, transfixed with the grace and beauty, the glory and grandeur, of the 
ideals that surrriund us; and, with equal preparation, greater than these are 
possible in living, breathing humanity. The same thought and devotion in 
real life would soon give us a generation of saints, scholars, scientists, and

statesmen, of glorified humanity; such as the world has not yet seen. To 
this hour, we have left the greatest event of life to chance, and the result is 
the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idiot, the lunatic, the epileptic, the crim- 
inal, the drunkard, the glutton — thousands of human beings, in our young 
republic, that never should have been born ; a tax on society, a disgrace to 
their parents, and a curse to themselves. 

Well, born — a child's next right is to intelligent care. If we buy a rare 
plant, we ask the florist innumerable questions as to its proper training; but 
the advent of an immortal being seems to suggest no new thought, no 
. iixious investigation into the science of human life. Here we trust every 
iiiing to an ignorant nurse, or a neighbor who knows perchance less than we 
do ourselves. 

Ignorance bandages the new-born child, as tight as a drum, from arm* 
pits to hips, compressing every vital organ. There is a tradition that all 
infants are subject to colic for the first three months of their existence ; at 
the end of which time the bandage is removed, and the colic ceases. Reason 
suggests that the bandage may be the cause of the colic, and queries as to 
the origin of the custom, and its use. She is told, with all seriousness, '* tiiat 
the bones of a new-bom child are like cartilage, that, unless they are pinned 
up snugly, they are in danger of falling to pieces." Reason replies: *' If In- 
finite Wisdom has made kittens and puppies so that their component parts 
remain together, it is marvelous that He should have left the human being 
wholly at the mercy of a bandage ; " and proposes, with her first-born, to dis- 
pense with swaddling bandages, leaving only a slight compress on the navel, 
for a few days, until [)erfectly healed. 

Ignorance, believing that every child comes into the world in a diseased 
and starving condition, begins at once the preparation of a variety of nos- 
trums, chemical and culinary, which she persistently administers to the 
struggling victim. Reason, knowing that after the fatigue of a long and 
perilous march, what the young soldier most needs is absolute rest in some 
warm and cozy tent, shelters him under her wing, and fights off all intruders, 
sure that when he needs his rations the world will hear from him. His first 
hath should be preceded by a generous application of pure, sweet olive-oil, 
from head to foot, in every little corner and crevice of his outer man ; and 
then he should be immersed in warm soap-suds, so nearly the temperature 
of the body as to cause no shock. Great care should be taken that neither 
oiV nor soap touch the eyes. The room should be very warm, all drafts ex- 
cluded ; and on emerging from the tub, a hot soft-fiannel blanket should be 
closely wrapped around him, in which he may rest awhile before dressing. 
The softest garments, simply made, and so cut as to fasten round the throat 
and rest on the shoulders, should constitute his wardrobe ; eschew all bands, 
pins, ligatures, ruffles, embroidery, caps, socks, etc. 

Let the child's first efforts at foraging for an existence be at his mother's 
breast; there he will find the medicine he needs, and just what she needs, 
too, to dispose of. 

The child's mouth and the mother's nipples should be carefully washed

before nursing; thus, much suffering, for both mother and child, will be 
prevented. 

"Give the baby water six times a day/' was one of the most important 
messages ever sent over the telegraph wires to a young mother. 

Ignorance bathes lier baby on a full stomach, because hhe finds it will go 
through the ordeal of dressing more quietly ; Reason bathes hers two hours 
after feeding, knowing that the vital forces needed for digestion should not 
be drawn to the surface. Being constructed on the same general plan with 
its parents, the same principle that makes it dangerous for u man to go 
swimming immediately after eating, makes it equally so to put a baby in its 
tub after nursing. 

Though Ignorance eats her own meals regularly and at stated times, she 
feeds her baby at all times and seasons. If the child has colic from over- 
eating, or the improper diet of its mother, she trys to ally its suffering with 
additional feeding and vigorous trotting; not succeeding, she ends the drama 
with a spoonful of Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup; having drugged the senti- 
nel and silenced his guns, she imagines the citadel safe. Reason feeds her 
baby regularly, by the clock, once in two or three hours, and gives the 
stomach some chance for rest She prevents colic by regulating her own 
diet and habits of life, knowing that improper articles of food, and ill-nature 
or outbursts of passion in the mother, have cost many a baby its life. 

Ignorance, having noticed that her baby sleeps longer with its head cov- 
ered, uniformly excludes the air. Breathing the same air over a dozen 
times, it becomes stupefied with the carbonic-acid gas, is thrown into a pro- 
fuse perspiration, and is sure to catch cold on emerging from the fetid atmos- 
phere. Reason puts her child to sleep, with head uncovered, in a spacious 
chamber, bright with sunlight and fresh air; where, after a long nap, she 
will often find him (as soon as he is old enough to notice objects) looking at 
the shadows on the wall, or studying the anatomical wonders of his own 
hands and feet, the very picture of content. 

Regular feeding, freedom in dress, plenty of sleep, water, sunlight, and 
pure air, will secure to babies that health and happiness that in nature 
should be their inheritance. 

"Seeing that the atmosphere is forty miles deep, all round the globe," 
says Horace Mann, "it is a useless piece of economy to breathe it more than 
once. If we were obliged to trundle it in the wheel-barrows, in order to fill 
our homes, churches, school -houses, railroad-cars, and steamboats, there 
might be s©me excuse for our seeming parsimony. But as it is we are pnxli- 
gals of health, of wliich wo have so little; and nij^jranls of air, of which wo 
have so much." — Mrs. Elizabeth Cady iUiuiton^ New York, 



Great care should be given that children are not fed with milk that has 
been turned by a thunder-storm. The chemical change is rapid, and extra 
caution is necessary. 

GiNQSk-BREAD made from oatmeal instead of flour is a good aperient for 
children.

Parents should teach their children to gargle their throats, for it may 
be the saving of their lives. It is easier to teach them this difficvilt and 
awkward feat in health than when prostrated by disease. 

To PREVENT A CHILD COUGHING AT NIGHT, boil the Strength out of ten cents 
worth of "seneca snake-root" in one quart of soft water; strain through a 
cloth, boil down to a pint, add one cui> powdered sugar made into a thick 
molasses. Give one tea-spoonful on going to bed. 

Children arf often troubled with ulcers in the ears after scarlet fever 
and other childreif s diseases. Roast onions in ashes until done, wrap in a 
strong cloth, and squeeze out juice. To three parts juice, add one part 
laudanum and one part sweet-oil, and bottle for use. Wash ear out with 
warm water, shake bottle well, and drop a few drops into the ear. 

For sore mouth in NuiisiNo babies, take a tea-spoon each of pulverized 
ulum and borax, half a sult-i«poon of pulvl>rized nut-gfiUs, a table-spoon of 
honey; mix, and pour on it half a tea-cup boiling water; let settle, and 
with a clean linen rag wash the mouth four or five times a day, using a 
fresh piece of linen every day ; or simple borax water is equally good. Half 
an even tea-spoon powdered borax in two table-spoons soft water is strong 
enough. 

A LUMP OP SUGAR, Saturated with vinegar, will stop hiccough when drink- 
ing water will not. For babies, a few grains of sugar will often snlfice. 
Care must be taken in giving sugar to nursing babies, as it is constipating! 
Dio Lewis says feather pillows are death to children. Make them oi straw 
or hair, and not too large. 

To cure the EARACHE, take a bit of cotton batting, put ujwn it a pinch 
of black pepper, gather it up and tie it, dip it in sweet-oil, and insert it 
into the ear. Put a flannel nandagc over tne head to keep it warm. 

Probably nine children out op ten who die of croup might be saved by 
the timely application of roast onions, mashed, laid upon a folded napkin, 
and goose-oil, sweet-oil, or even lard, poured on ana applied as warm as 
can be borne comfortably to the throat and upper part of the chest, and 
to the feet and hands, or the onions may be sliced, boiled soft in wate^ 
until almost dry, grease added, and cooked in the grease until browned. 

Let nature wake the children ; she will not do it prematurely.. Take 
care that they go to bed at an early hour — let it be earlier and earlier, until 
it is found that they wake up themselves in full time to dress for breakfast! 

Just bepore each meal let a child have some ripe fruit or some fruit 
eauce. Apples and berries are wholesome. Oranges should never be given 
to children unless the skin and the thick white part underneath the skin 
and between the quarters is all carefully removea. 

While the baby is down for a creep, draw little stocking legs over his 
arms, and secure them by a safetv-pin. 

See that a child's food is well cooked. Never give a child new bread. 
Always insist that a child tlioroughly masticate his food. Avoid too nour- 
ishing a diet for a child of a violent, fretful temper. Give a nourishing 
diet to a pale, white-looking, delicate child. Both under-feeding and over- 
feeking are apt to produce scrofula or consumption. Carefully study a 
child's constitution, digestive powers, teeth, strength, and endeavor to pro- 
portion to these the kind ana the quantitv of its food. Sweetmeats and 
confectionery should only be given to children very sparingly, if at all. 
Never pamper or reward a child with them. A child should never be al- 
lowed to go to sleep with damp, cold feet. Neglect of this has often re- 
sulted in dangerous attacks of croup, diphtheria, or a fatal sore throat 
Always on entering the house in rainy, muddy, or thawy weather, the 
child should remove its shoes, and the mother should herself ascertain 
whether the st/>ckings are the least damp. If they are they should be taken 
off, the feet held before the fire, and rubbed with the hands until perfectly 
dry, and dry stockings and shoes put on. 

'Dr. Osgood recommends as a night suit for children a single garment^ 



SOMETHISQ ABOUT BABIES, 545 

ending in drawers and stockings. Over this, in cold weather, may be worn 
a flannel sack. At severe seasons, instead of putting an extra coverlet on 
the bed, he advisee the use of a large bag, made or a light blanket, in- 
to which the child may be securely placed, and closely buttoned around 
the neck. Light coverings generally are preferable to heavy ones, if the 
night-clothing and the room are sufficiently warm, as they do not induce 
perspiration nor check exhalations. 

Eating snow, except in very limited quantities, is very injurious, produc- 
ing catarrh, congestion and many other troubles. 

Jumping the rope is an injurious and dangerous amusement, often re- 
sulting in disease of the spine and brain. 

For worms, give rue tea; for colic, catnip tea. 

Never let the little children go out of doors in winter without being 
warmly clpd. They lose heat rapidly, and easily contract throat and lung 
affections. Every child should have full suits of underclothing; and espe- 
cially let the legs and ankles be well ' protected with thick stockings and 
lemngs. 

Bathe children in the forenoon when possible, or, if not too tired, an 
hour before the evening meal ; never for at teast an nonr after eaiina. When 
possible bathe before an open fire or in a warm room near, and rub dry 
oefore an open fire. It is injurious to bathe cliildren on rising before break- 
fast, especially in cold weather. Washing the face, neck, and hands, and 
dressing, is enough before refreshing the body by eating. 

Great care must be taken that the navel of infants takes its proper place. 
If not attended to it is likely to puff out and produce a breach. It it shows 
any signs of protruding, round a piece of cork into a ball as large as a 
large marble, cover with linen, and lay over the navel, fastening it to ita 
place by six or ei^ht strips of adhesive plaster. Let it remain for a month 
or six weeks, as it will cause no inconvenience. 

If a scurf or milk-crust appears on the head, do not apply water, but 
brush often gently with a suft baby's brush. 

For constipation, bran water is an excellent remedy. Boil two table- 
spoons bran in a pint of water for two hours, strain and use as food. It 
must be made fresh every day, and the fresher the better. 

No child should go to bed hungry, but food taken near the hours of 
sleeping should be of the simplest nature, — a cracker, a bit of bread, or a 
glass of milk. 

A BABY should SLEEP ON ITS SIDE. When lying on its back the food 
sometimes rises in its throat and chokes it 

Great care should be taken to shade a baby's eyes from the light If 
a strong light shines directly in its face, it often produces ophthalmia, an 
intianiination of the eyelid.^, which is troublesome and dangerous. A few 
drops of breast-milk, applied to the eye and worked under the lid, is very 
healing to sore lids. 

Some babies' skink will not bear flannel. In this case a linen shirt 
should be put on first, and flannel over it. 

When chafed, squeeze cold water over the parts chafed. Dry lightly 
without rubbing, and a]>ply vaseline or cold cream. 

In cleansing the ear, penetrate no deeper than you can clearly see. 
Never scratch or inflame the entrance to the ear. The ear-wax is not dirt, 
and should not be removed, at lea.st only that portion wliich is plainly visi- 
ble should be di.sturbed. Pins and scrapers inserted in the ear are injurious. 
The wax will find its way out when too much is accumulated. Scraping 
produces irritation, discomfort, and calls for a repetition, which, after a 
time, produces disease. Sweet-oil, glycerine, etc., are apt to clog the ear 
and produce inflammation. Syringing the ear with tepid water relieves 
itching. If cold air gives pain a little wool, placed in the ear while out of 
doors, will protect

Always hold a baby with feet next the fire, when sitting in a room with a 
fire in it. The old adage, '* Keep the feet warm and head cool," means a 
good deal. 

If the children who attend school are puny and do not seem to thrive, 
take them away from school. Give the child a robust body, whether he is 
at the head or tail of hi.s cla«*. 

Don't give the babv cordials, soothing syrups, and sleeping-drops. Touch 
lightly uaregoric. All such things injure Ihe constitution of the child. 

The New York Sun say.w : " The pain of teething may be almost done away, 
and the health of the child benefited, by giving it line splinters of ice, 
picked off with a pin, to melt in its moutli. The fragment is so small that 
It is but a drop of warm water before it can be swallowed, and the child 
lias all the coolness for its feverish gums without the slightest injury. 
The avidity with which the little things taste the cooling morsel, the in- 
stant q^uiet which succeeds hours of fretfulness, and the sleep which follows 
the relief, are the best witnesses to this magic remedy. Ice may be fed to 
three months' child this way, each splinter being no longer than a com- 
mon pin, for five or ten minutes, the result being that it has swallowed in 
that time a teaspoonful of warm water, which so far from being a barm, 
is good for it, and the process may be repeated hourly as often as the fret- 
ting fits from teething oegin " 

It is not necessary to w-hoily exclude the light from the room when the 
bal)e is born. The admission of sunlight should be regulated : but a soft 
and pleasant li^ht is a benefit to both mother and child. The oabv should 
not be carried into a glowing sunshine, but should become gradually accus- 
tomed to the light. 

For restlessness or colic in children, give a warm bath at bed-time, dry 
quickly with soft towels, and rub well with the hand ; dress loosely, wrap 
in flannel blanket, warm and lay away to sleep. 

For colic, give three or four swallows of warm water; place one hand on 
8tomacli and one on back, and give a lively trotting. This is better than a 
barrel of soothing syrup. If one ** trip to Boston*' on tlie knee will not 
do, try two, or three even, with a drink of warm water before starting. For 
Bore mouth or constipation, give three or four good swallows of cold water 
the first thing in the morning. This is both a preventive and a cure. 

OxE of the best remedies for chafing is cocoa outter, which may be had 
in cakes, at any drug store. Warm slightly, if necessary, and apply to the 
chafed parts. Cocoa butter is also excellent for greasing in scarlet fever. 
Among the old-fashioned and good remedies for the same purpose is t^e 
fjitty inside of the rind of a piece of smoked ham. 

For colds, hoarseness, or indications of croup, slice raw onions, sprinkle 
with granulated sugar, let stand until the juice is extracted (to hasten the 
flow of the juice, place in heater for a few moments), pour off juice, and 
give a teaspoonful every hour, or oftener if the case is severe. 

Gre\sin({ the navel, bowels, and up and down spine, at night before going 
to bed, promotes regular action of the bowels, and cures constipation. 

If injections are necessary for babies, warm water with a very little pure 
snip dissolved in it is better than inserting a piece of hard soap, as is 
oft'Mi done. Small syringes with flexible tubes, are now made, and are much 
safer than the old form of syringe. 

Sweet flag, which may be obtained in a dried state at any drug store, is 
an excellent remedy for colic in children. Make a mild lea of it, sweeten, 
and give a teas])oonful whenever there are signs of trouble coming on. 

For teething children, an ivory ring, a silver dollar, or some similar 
article should be provided for them to bite on. Give plenty of pure water 
to drink. Or dip the end of the finger in cold water and rub the inflamed 
gums. 

In washing children, do not let the water run into the ears. Children 
should never be washed in a careless, slipsho<l manner. The excretions 



SOMETHING ABOUT BABIES, 547 

and the exhalations of the skin are often acrid enough to produce great 
irritation and suffering, and careful washing, with liberal enough use of 
water to insure cleanhness, and a rapid and thorough drying, removing 
every particle of moisture in all the crevices of the skin, and that with a 

fentle hand. Use as litcie soup us possible, and that the finest kind, and 
e sure to wash it off thoroughly with pure soft water. After the surface is 
well dried, any harmless powder, such as corn starcli, may be used to prevent 
chafing. 

In the case of a sick child, if the skin is tender when there is pressure^ 
wash with diluted camphor water. Sick children should not lie long in one 
position, and the bed should be as smooth as possible. If there is any dis- 
ease in the head, a pillow of finely shredded corn-husks should take the 
place of a feather pillow. Cool, salt-water baths remove the prickly heat 
that is so annoying in summer. 

The warm bath, the water being at about the same heat as the surface 
of the body, is best for young children. As they grow older the bath may 
be made cooler. 

Always be able to have a fire in at least one room in the house, even 
in the warmest setLSon, if there are children in the family. In the Northern 
States there is rarely a month in the vear during which there is not an 
occasional day or evening when fire woul^ be beneficial. 

Children should always play on the sunnj'' side of the yard. or street in 
cold weather. The sun-warmed air is what they need. Children less than 
four years old ought not to play out of doors when the thermometer ranges 
lower than 25° above zero. 

To ventilate apartments without causing a draft, raise the lower sash four 
to six inches, and place vmder it a board perfectly fitted to the casing, so as 
to shut out all air. The cold, outside air then passes upward between the 
sash, to the u]>per part of the room, and is diffused without causing a draft. 
The night air is not objectionable, except in malarious regions. Indeed, 
in cities, tlie night air is i)urer than what is abroad by day. In the hot 
season, children should be kept out of the sun after ten o'clock, and may 
sit up lat€r than usual at night to enjoy the cool evenings. Excessive heat 
is as fatal as excessive cold. Keep the baby cool by baths, but never put it 
to sleep in a room from which the sunshine is constantly kept. No room 
can be wholesome where sunshine is never admitted. 

AUNT Martha's prescriptions. 

Give a babe, one to four weeks old, two teanspoons saffron tea (made by 
simmering a teaspoon dry saffron in half a teacup water), once every other 
day. 

If troubled with colic, give catnip tea (simmering half a tea cup of cat- 
nip in boiling water to cover, strain and sweeten) every night before the 
time for colic to come on. Catnip should always be gatliered when in 
bloom, and before dog-days: then dry in the shade. When dried, place in 
a jiaper sack, and hang in a dry. cool place. 

One tea-spoon of pure castor oil given to a new-born babe is excellent to 
carry off the phiegm that usually troubles it. 

Babes from one to six month's old can safely be given two teaspoons of 
castor oil at a time, when suffering with a cold. Mixing a teaspoon oi Orleans 
molasses with it will prevent jyriping. 

A CHILD ten inoTiths old, if choked with a bad cold, will be speedily re- 
lieved by taking three teaspoons of pure castor oil. Cliildren are differently 
affected by tlie oil, so it is safe to begin with one teaspoon of castor oil, and 
increase if needed. 

In scarlet fever, the first symptoms being like a severe cold, treat it in 
the same way; keep the bowels open with castor oil, grease the throat, breast, 
and back with pig's-feet oil, goose grease, lard, or smoked ham rinds, or the 
fryings of salt pork or bacon. Grease very thoroughly. If the throat is 



548 SOMETHING ABOUT BABIES. 

sore, chop fat salt pork and raw onions tofrether, like hash, put them in a 
sack, warm a little, and* tie round the throat Change this {poultice when 
needed, but keep it on until the throat is entirely well. This poultice is 
much Ijetter than those made of hot water, as there is no danger of taking cold 
in changing it. 

To prevent catching conta^ous diseases, put a small lump each of camphor 
gum, urimstone, and assafetida in a little sack, and tie around the body with 
a tape. 

Ax excellent cough remedy is made as follows: Take enough of horehound 
to 111] u three pint cup, iM)ur soft water over it until full, let it simmer until 
all tlie strength is extracted (keep the tin full), then strain ; to three pints 
of this tea add a pint of pure whisky and enough of loaf sugar to make a 
.yrup ; dose, tablespoon half hour before eating, and the last thing before 
n*tirinp:. This renu'dy and dose is for an adult. 

A (iooD remedy forcohc is tincture of assafetida; take a lump the size of 
a hulled walnut, cover it with an ounce of pure whisky (in fourteen days it 
is tincture, but in a few days it will be strong enough to use). Begin with 
one drop in sweetened water, if the child is very young, and increase as re- 

?uired. Give this U) the child an hour before the time for the colic to begin, 
f a child is given this, as it grows older, each morning a few drops, it will 
not be troubled witii worms. 

In croup, redden tbo throat and chest by rubbing with a mixture of one- 
half tablesptK)n each of camphor and turjKjntine and one tablespoon each 
of coal oil and sweet oil. Wet a warm flannel with this, and apply to the 
throat and neck for a few minutes, watching closely so as to remove it when 
the skin is well reddened. No time can be given, as some skins are more 
sensitive than others. This outward irritation tends to prevent croup. 

For worms in children (these do not appear until after the child begins to 
eat other food than its mother's milk), give one-eighth of a teaspoonful of 
santonin mixed with a little sugar and a drop or two of w^ater, once every 
three hours ; continue for six doses. Follow with a dose of castor oil to 
which has been added five drops of spirit of turpentine. The above is a 
dose for a child of one year old; for older children, Increase the dose some- 
what Pumpkin-seed tea is also a grmd remedy for worms, and entirely 
harmless. All remedies for worms must be taken on an empty stomach. 

LroKiLY for the rising generation, fashion recognizes the necessity for pro- 
tection of the neck and arms of infants, and while the infant wears long 
slips the feet are fairly well p<x>tected in the summer, but if thev seem in 
the least cold to the hand, soft woolen socks should be put on. When short 
clothes are ]»ut on, longer socks should take the place of the short ones. No 
pains should be spared to keep the legs and feet warm in both summer 
and winter. *' Keep the feet warm and head cool," is an old but wise maxim. 
If the oj)posite condition exists, look out for serious illness. In winter let 
the baby wear warmly lined shoes, chosen for comfort and not for show. 
Tlic care of the extremities is very important, and the baby should never 
be allowed to go with cohl hands. The baby creeping alx)ut and the child- 
ren playing on the tltK>r. are ex])r)sed to all the drafts that enter through the 
crevices of the walls. The cold air immediately seeks the floor, and a grown 
person has only to lie <lown on the cariK't in the vicinity of a window or door 
to be convinced of the source of many a cold and sore throat Weather- 
f^trips, in r(H)!iis where children play much, are useful; in their absence, 
paste a strip of paper across where the lower siush tils into the casing, and 
get ventilation by the up]>er8ash. If doors swing inward, a heavy rug may 
be placed against it outside, or an old garment. Add to all these precau- 
tions warm clothing. Wiien children are large enough to play out of doors 
in cold weather, good woolen leggings should be worn. In rainy weather, 
the light gos.samer rubber cloth, winch may be Ixmght by the yard and made 
at home, nitdtes excellent protection from wet, and yet is not a burden. If 
replaced by a woolen garment in dry weather, no harm will result. Every

scb'j^i-girl should have a circular cape of this material. Let no desire to 
have your children in fashion induce you to send them out with less clothing 
for the feet and legs than would be required to make a grown person com- 
fortable. The scanty cjothing of the lower limbs brings on repeated attacks 
of croup and various diseases of the throat and lungs. Not only is this true, 
hut the low temperature and imperfect circulation of the blood prevents the 
development of the parts exposed and brings on a race of fashionable, but 
spindle-shanked, children. Don't be deceived by tlie prevailing idea that 
cnildren of the extremely poor, that are half cared for, and of parents who 
habitually neglect them, are " healthy," Among this very class Death makes 
the heaviest harvest; and those who live are stunted by neglect, in spite of 
extra hardiness of constitution. Of course, to remove the ordinary clothing 
and substitute lighter for a party or a heated audience-room, is the height 
of imprudence. At the close of such an occasion, plenty of wraps should be 
provided against the exposure to the cold air when overheated. Young 
children had best wear nannel underclothing the whole year. When sud- 
den changes take place to colder weather, see tliat the children have addi- 
tional protection before they take cold. 

A warm suit for the first short clothes of the baby during the first winter, 
is made up as follows : A knit flannel shirt, a loo;«e flannel bandage about 
the body, over the bowels (an excellent protection against summer com« 

plaints, if continued through the next 
summer), a skirt of oi)era flannel with 
a muslin waist, with two rows of but- 
tons (four in each row), about an inch 
apart, one to support the skirt and the 
other for the diaper drawers, which 
are made of the same flannel as the 
skirt. The accompanying cuts will ex- 
plain clearly the manner in which these are made. This 
useful garment, either in flannel or muslin, may and should 
be worn from the time short clothes are put on until diapers 
are left off or even longer. The cut on left hand of page gives the form of 
garment, when taken off. The one on the right, the same garment when 
put on and buttoned up. The dress should be of the same material, and 
color as tlie skirt and drawers, and cut in Gabrielle style, with long sleeves. 
Over this wear a white dress of Nainsook, made plain or elaborate, as may 
be desired. In summer, this suit of skirt, drawers, and dress, made in 
Silicia, with the overdress of white, is a safe and cromfortable dress for a 
child, and not easily soiled. 

A proper dress for an infant, the first time it is dressed, is a bandage of 
soft nannel, put on loosely about the body, a knit w(X)len shirt, a pinningf- 
blanket, maae of a piece of soft white flannel, three-fourths of a vara 
square, and taken up about one-fourth of a yard at the top by a single box- 
pleat, three inches wide, and cauglit together on the wrong side for about 
three inches from the toj). On each side of the box-pleat make a small pleat, 
to be let out as tlie infant grows. The flannel should be bound with silk 
binding before pleating, pinned on with safetv pins next the flannel shirt, a 
waist with arm-noles but no sleeves, buttoned t>ehind with a small flat but- 
ton, and having on the bottom one button in front, one on each side, one in 
<'enter of back, and one an inch and a half on each side of the last-named. 
The skirt is fastened to these buttons. The three buttons behind serve this 
purpose. Wlien ciiild i.s small, each end is carried past the center button to 
the ones an inch and a half beyond it, but as the clnld grows and needs more 
room, the ends are brought together at the centt^r button. The skirt is made 
of flannel, seven-eighths of a yard long. The dress, which should be about 
one yard long, may be made of any white material. Add to this a pair of 
soft knit socks, and the dress is complete. A modest wardrobe should com« 
prise: two knit shirts, three pinning blankets, four bandages of different

sizes, three flannel skirts, three waists, six muslin slips, six dresses of differ- 
ent patterns but about the same in regard to warmth, or better, of same 
material, checked or striped goods, and differently trimmed, two finer dresses, 
which may be made a little longer for style, though the weight is objection- 
able as a burden to the child, two pairs of short socks, and as the child 
frows older, two pairs of Ifnit boots, and two dozen diapers (cotton are best, 
aying more ^absorbing capacity than linenV one yard long, and for the first, 
about five-eighths of a yard wide. Fold the inside one once, end to end, 
then again from comer to corner ; the outside, fold once from end to end, 
and pin one side with safety pins to the flannel band, allowing it to hang 
down to protect the legs, wrien short clothes are put on, fold the outside 

diaper as directed above, and use one of lighter ma- 
terial, or an old thin one, for the inside. Fold the 
latter, end to end once, and then once more in the 
same direction. The outside one is now in three-cor- 
nered shape ; lay it down with ^int toward you, lay 
the other over it, as represented in diagram, and they 
are ready to put on. f^or night use, wear a bandage, a 
pinning blanket, and a flannel ni^ht dress, made with 
sleeves long enough to gather in with a gathering-string over the hands. 
Of course, no garment should be worn at night that has oeen worn during- 
the day. 

AUNT EVA'S way. 

This is the idea to start with — that we are dealing with liUk people. To- 
be sure they are fearfully and wonderfully made, but only in the same sense 
as their parents. As many of these same parents do not understand tlie 
first principles of caring for themselves, we are obliged to begin at the be- 
ginning, it is important in the life of a chil() to be^n right. The treats 
ment many a babe receives during the first hours of its life causes it to be 
a puny, su fieri ng infant, giving it a constitution predisposed to disease. 
The first thing is to protect the sensitive darling from exposure. There 
must be absolutely no exposure to chill. Thirf is easily done by plenty of 
soft, warm flannels — a dozen pieces or more, some of which need be quite 
shawls. When needed, they must be full of fire warmth, full as they can 
hold, no matter if it is a warm August night. When the child needs 
attention, make the pliysician take a large piece of this and cover it in- 
stjintly. He can do his whole duty with the child well covered. Never 
use water for the first bath, but sweet-oil; I prefer the oil of sweet cream, 
made by simmering cream in a shallow dish on the stove until the oil 
separates, to be applied with a soft piece of warm flannel. If care is used 
in removing the oil, you will be surprised to see how sweet the little one 
looks; on no account use water on the child until it is well climatized, 
say twenty-four to forty-eight hours. When a babe screams through its 
first toilet operation, it is either cold or frightened. Desist at once, and 
fold it closer in its warm wrappings, making sure that nothing soiled or 
damp is touching it. I^et the little head be cared for first, then one arm, 
and so on, keeping the rest of the body carefully covered. After having 
the oil well applied, I would rather my child would lie a week with only 
its flannel wrappings than be dressed while screaming, but if you go right 
so far you will nave no trouble. 

Its clothing can be any thing that is warm enough and loose enough. 
Don't pin it up as if it was to be used to play ball with, and was in dan- 
ger of getting tumbled to pieces. It is not even to be handled much, but 
laid away to rest as long as it will, and kept Htill ; don't let some loving 
soul keep it swaying around. If it acts like waking up or is uneasj*. pass 
yoxxT hands carefully under it, and gently turn it oh its other side. 

Its food, first and only, at present is that which God has so wisely pro^

Tided; this is all that it needa, even if it gets but a few drops at a time. If 
it can not be satisfied without worrying the mother too muctif a little — a very- 
little — fresh cow's milk can be used with pure sugar and one-third water. 
Always remember this — the milk of a "farrow cow" will kill a young lamb 
just as sure as it enters its stomach. 

I do not think it wise to insist on regular feeding times for nursing infants, 
or as long as milk is the chief sustenance. There are many days when the 
healthiest of children are fretful. Their gums begin to swell younger than 
is generally supposed. There is nothing more soothing than — well, just let 
the little pet have its own way ; it will prove to you when it is most comfort- 
able. A Saby never cries if it is comfortable ; when«4t ciies it asks for some- 
thing; put yourself in itsplace and maybe you can come near to the under- 
standing. Many of its sufierings are caused by unwise changes in its clothing. 
You give it a slight cold by your own thoughtlessness; then for heaven's sake 
don't give it some soothing syrup to weaken its digestion, and render it liable 
to be hurt by all food except the simplest My oldest bov is a victim to sootli- 
ing medicines. He must be so careful througli watermelon and fruit season, 
or he will be sick all the time ; but four others, all past five years old, who 
never took as much as a cup of sage-tea, of medicine, can digest any thing. 
Mv remedy for most of the ailments of children is fire warmth. 

For colic, unpin the little one's clothing so that the fire can shine clear to 
its arm-pits, heating your own hand and passing it gently over the restless 
little squirmer. This will either prevent or cure almost any thing. If it 
seems very sick, its head hot, you must watch that; I ^ever knew a child to 
go into fits unless its head was hot and its hands and feet cold. In this case, 
bathe the little feet in wann water; and, if it is in summer, get the leaves of 
horse-radish, or a plant of that nature, roll and wilt them, and bind on the 
soles of the feet and in the palms of the hands; not to blister, only to keep 
moist and wann. If you can not get the green leaves, ginger on wet warm 
cloths will do. Then keep the head wet, and kee{> ever^ one from the room 
but the one whom the child wishes to take care of it. Give water or milk — 
whichever the child prefers ; or, if not weaned, let it nurse all it wishes, no 
matter if it keeps throwing it up— that is natiire's provision for nursing^ 
babiiis. It is reaa^ now to be soothed to sleep, and will generally waken with 
a gentle perspiration. When you think you must give some kind of warm 
tea, ^ve pure warm water that has been boiled ; it is the best hot drink out 
for either mother or child in pain. 

My mother was once taken three miles on a cold winter's night to see a 
young infant that they feared was going into fits. It screamed and strug- 
gled and fought for breath, while its young mother, pale with fear was 
walking the house crying too. *' Why, said mother, '* the child has only 
got the * snuffles,' bring me a little soft grease." She rubbed the nose 
gently until the child was partially^ relieved. Being cjuite a bad case, she 
advised the mother to milk a strain of breast-milk into the nostril ; she 
did so, the child sneezed three or four times and dropped asleep in two 
minutes. This is also all that is needed for weak or sore eyes in an infant 
— ^breast milk. 

For sore mouth, a weak solution of borax ; but vour child will not have 
a sore mouth or any other disease, if you follow these directions and vour 
own good sense ; and remember that soothing syrups are the lazy mother's 
•cure. It is so much easier to put a child to sleep than to bathe it and 
warm it and nurse it well. 

For croup, take sweet hog's lard and tincture of camphor or camphor 
gum and simmer together a short time ; gum the size of a pea to a table- 
spoon of lard; keep it in the house prepared, and rub on the throat at 
first symptom. This will relieve any hard cough almost instantly ; if it 
does not, mix one teaspoon of it with a tablespoon of molasses, and take in- 
wardly. If you are called to a child too bad — too far gone — for theae 
simple remedies, put it in a warm bath as quick as it can oe prepared. 



552 SOMETHING ABOUT BABIES. 

For whooping-cotigh, encour^ the child to eat sour fniits, either cooked 
or raw, or both, all it wishes. This keeps the system cool, the bowels open, 
and the throat clear. 

In weaning your darling, be sure you have plenty of suitable food in 
the house that' baby is fond of. First teach baby to' go to sleep without 
nursing ; after he has become accustomed to this, teach him to oo without 
it during the dav, and to go to sleep at bed-time ; then let him nurse all 
he wishes through the rest of the night, only being careful to leave the bed 
before he awakens in the morning. Let him nurse this wav for several 
weeks, that the change of living may not be too sudden. I liave weaned 
three children in this way without a single crying spell, and no one about 
the house knew about it. 

The family physician is a great blessing — more so than his medicine. 
Never fail to call him in time, if the disease proves stubborn ; but let him 
understand that you wish advice as to nursing, and not his medicine, un- 
less it is very necessary. Most peojjle -think if a doctor leaves no drugs 
behind his visit is so much lost money ; doctors understand this, and 
leave medicine whether necessary or not. As your child conquers one 
trifling ailment after another and grows in health and beauty, you will grad- 
ually gain a confidence in nature that will be a great rock of defense for 
a parent of a growing family ; if you will obey her laws she will never dis- 
appoint you. 

The regular meals, so necessary to the health and comfort of a family, 
must be regular. If you insist on the children only eating at their meals, 
don't sit and sew, or visit, with hunger gnawing at. their vitals. I think it 
safest to allow growing children to have a piece between meals, if they are 
hungry enough to eat dry, light bread ; no butter to grease things, or molastset 
or milk to tempt them to eat more than they need for necessary sup^Kjrt, 
The only trouble, I find, is they soon get to be too fond of the crusts and '* pud- 
ding pieces." 

The care of the feet is the great picket post after the child begins to run 
alone. Watch, watch the little feet that no damp or chill is creeping up to 
chill the vitals. A pair of warm stockings to each pair of restless feet must 
be kept by the stove in all damp or cold weather, and never let a child 
stop a moment its tictive play until you know whether its feet are warm and 
dry. You had better change feet-covering four or five times a day during 
those delightful, treacheron.s springdays, than towatch a sick-bed and lose your 
darling at last. This i.«« what neglect of the feet often brings the little onet 
to. I know the task 1 am enjoining on mothers and nurses. I have had 
twenty-three pairs of stockings hanging around my cook-stove at once, each 
pair in daily use for exchanges. But I do not know what it is to lose a 
child, or hafdlv a night's rest, and we have raised six from babyhood. Never 
let them go to "bed without having their feet all aglow with warmth to their 
knees from the bright fire shining upon them. This is my hobby; fire- 
warmth. It will cure ear-ache, stomacn-ache, head-ache, le^s-ache ; prevent 
neuralgia, whit^-swellings, rheumatic pains, indigestion. Yes, Pm a "fire 
worshiper," and you will l)e after you have tried its virtues on yourself and 
children faithfully for twenty years. 

In conclusion, my theory is incessant watchfulness of first symptoms — 
prevention rather than cure. But let no untried mother feel discouraged ; the 
care of a babe is no trouble to a true mother. As often as it needs attention, 
so often do her eyes long for a sight of the sweet dimpled flesh, the dainty 
limbs; the loving touch of the little hands upon her face and neck has more 
than mesmeric power. And after all is done for them, if they seem to you 
to be growing coarse and unlovely, smile upon them oftener, kiss them, caress 
them. Don't let the pressing duties of the younger ones lead you to ne- 
glect the older ones. If a child once learns to do without mother's caressses^ 
you can never again make them necessary to that child. 



SOMETHING ABOUT BABIES. 553 



TEETHING. 



When the first signs of the teeth appear, the salivary glands are so fur 
developed that the secretion of saliva is large, and "drooling" is notice<l. 
This saliva moistens the gums and softens them, so that the com^nj^ teotu 
make their way through with -less difficulty. At this time an ivory coral 
or hard rubber ring is useful. There is a sensation in the gums wiiich 
the child tries to relieve by biting. Later, when the gum is inllain»-i 
and sore, a soft substance is better than hard. If the gum is nun li 
swollen, and there are symi)tonis of tliirst and fever and flushed cheeks, tlio 
child should be seen by a physician. There may be something more seriou.-* 
than teething. 

If the case is mild, soothing applications such as honey of roses, borax 
and honey, and syrup of gum araoic will relieve. If bowels are constipated 
an injection may oe given, or even a mild laxative, with a warm foot-bath at 
bed-time. Lancing of the gums is sometimes necessary, and is harmless and 
not painful if done skillfully and at the proper time. Rubbing the gums 
with a thimble is very harsh treatment. « 

When a child falls ill, a good many people charge the trouble to "worms." 
The real cause of the trouble is generally indigestion, which causes an in- 
creased secretion of mucus, and this makes a harbor for worms, which in 
themselves do !»ot produce irritation, unless they exist in great numbers. 
Bottle-fed children oftener suffer from indigestion than others. The indi- 
cations are pining, pevishness, constipation or diarrhea, a sour breatli, etc. 
These may result from overfeeding or from unsuitable food. Overfeeding is 
most frequent. If the stomach is not able to digest the food it will irritate 
the bowels and produce diarrhea. The summer diarrhea of children hegins 
with indigestion, whi(;h weakens the system, and makes it sensitive to hot 
weather. The proi)er color for passages from the bowels in infancy is yel- 
low. In cases of indigestion the color is greenish, or, if yellow when passecl, 
soon becomes green. In diarrhea they are offensive ana greenish, or even a 
bright green. The point is to find out the cause of tiie trouble and cctrcct 
it in the early stages of the disease. 

The daily increase in weight of a healthy infant is from a quarter to 
three-quarters of an ounce. 

Batliing ought not to be neglected for a single day. It ought to be re- 
garded as a sacred maternal duty. 

The hair should be kept short during infancy and childhood. No finer 
heads of hair are ever seen than those on girls whose hair has been crop})cd 
close, boy-fashion, until ten years old. 

No more dangerous humbug was ever taught than that malt liquors o- 
wine was necessary or healthful for a nursing woman. 

Sugar should always be an addition to less palatable food, and never 
given alone. 

A strict observance of the laws of health will strengthen a good const; 
tution and improve a bad one. 

Diarrhea in nursing children is always the result in a change in the 
composition of the milk, from whatever cause. 

The period of weaning should be fixed between twelve and twenty 
months, beginning by ceasing to give the breast at night. 

Children .should not sleep with sickly persons or with those of advanced 
8ge. 

Where an infant sleeps, light and noise should be excluded. 

A young child should not be wakened suddenly, nor by any rude motion 
or loud noise. 

Pulling roughly, trotting, tossing, swinging from side to side, and all rude 
play of this sort does no good and may do great harm. 

A wise mother, who has a cheerful disposition herself and performs well 
her duties as nurse, will have no good rea.son to complain that uer time is all 
occupied by day and her rest disturbed by night.

554 SOMETHINO ABOUT BABIES. 

A YOUNG MOTHER writes: *' I have a little boy seven years old, and a little 
eirl of four. I have never had the trouble of some yoang mothers, simplv 
because I was regular with them from their birth. They never slept with 
me, but in a crib at the side of my bed. I had the crib lined so as to prevent 
a draught, and tucked their covers tightly over their feet and fastened them 
at the top with large safety pins to the pillow — then they can not throw them 
off to take cold. I never nursed my babies more than twice in the night, 
and often but once ; they slept better being alone. In the mornine I nursed 
baby, and once between breakfast and dinner, and again between dinner and 
supper, also right after dinner was over, at regular hours every day. If they 
>rot hungry between times, they were ted bread and milk. After sapper, 
tlie little one was undressed, rubbed well, back and limbs, flannel nightgown 
put on, theu nursed and put to bed, and they seldom awoke before twelve 
o'clock; so I had the evenings for reading and practicing. In the morning 
they were taken up, bathed in warm water, dressed, nursed, and given a nap 
of two hours. In the afternoon they were put to sleep at one o'clock, and 
they would sleep till three. I think no mother should nurse her baby after 
.it is a year old ; it breaks the mother down, and does baby no good. As my 
children grew out of babyhood I still kept them regular in their habits. 
They get up in the morning at seven o'clock, wash, dress, and eat breakfast, 
drinking milk instead of coffee, play all the morning, and eat a hearty din- 
ner. At one o'clock they are put in a bath, their night clothes put on, and 
gut to bed. They sleep till three or half-past, then are dressed cleanly. At 
alf-past five they eat a light supper, and in summer time at eight, and in 
winter time at half-past six, are put to bed. Two healthier children will be 
hard to find ; they never eat between meals, unless it is an apple, and never 
want any thing else, but eat heartily at the table. I think if some voung 
mothers will try my plan they will say there is no need of half-sick ancl cross 
cliildren, caused by eating at all hours and being up late at night'* 

Sudden Checking op Perspiration. — A Boston merchant, m " lending a 
hand," on board one of his own ships on a windy day, found himself, at 
the §ndof an hour and a half, pretty well exhausted and perspiring freely. 
He sat down to rest, and engagm^ in conversation, time passed faster than he 
was aware of. In attempting to rise he found he was unable to do so without 
assistance. He was taken iiome and put to bed, where he remained two 
years ; and for a long time after could only hobble about with the aid of a 
crutch. Less exposures than this have, in constitutions not so vigorous, re- 
sulted in infiammation of the lungs — "pneumonia" — ending in death in 
less than a week, or causing tedious rheumatisms, to be a source of torture 
for a lifetime. Multitudes of lives would be saved everv year^ and an in- 
calculable amount of human suffering would be preventecl if parents would 
begin to explain to their children, at tlie ^e of three or four years, the danger 
which attends cooling off too quickly after exercise, and the importance of 
not standing still after exercise, or work, or play, or of remaining exposed to 
the wind, or of sitting at an open window or door, or of pulling off any gar- 
ment, even the hat or bonnet, while heated. 

The Uses of a Sand-bao. — One of the most convenient articles to be used 
ill a sick-room is a sand-bag. Get some fine sand, dry it thoroughly in a 
kettle on the stove, make a bag about eight inches square of flannel,* fill it 
w^ith the dry sand, sew the opening carefully together, and cover the bag 
with cotton or linen cloth. This will prevent the sand from sifting out, ana 
will also enable you to heat the bag quickly by placing it in the oven, or 
even on the top of the st<^ve. After once using this you will never again 
attempt to warm the feet or hands of a sick person with a bottle of hot 
water or a brick. The sand holds the heat a long time, and the bag can be 
tucked up to the back without hurting the invalid. It is a good plan to 
make two or three of the bags and keep them ready for use. 

Give babies very little sugar, in any form whatevel", as it has a tendency *o 
constipate.

On the first symptoms of cold, such as snuffling, or any slight hoarse- 
ness, give immediately a warm foot bath, and then grease with mutton 
tallow the nose, neck, chest, and feet; warm the feet well at the fire. Sweet- 
oil, pig's-foot oil, or any kind of good grease will answer as well as mutton 
tallow. After warming w^ell put them to bed and wrap up well.

The fbllowlng mles for the munagemeut of infants daring the hotseasoa are from Dr. 
Wilsdo'a " summer and Its Difteoses ** : 

ItrUe t.-> Bathe the child once a day In tepid water. If feeble, sponge all over twice a day 
with tepid water, or tepid water and vinegar. 

Jiule2,—AvolA all tight bandaging. Make clothing light and cool, and so looAe that tbe 
limbs may bave free play. At night undress, sponge, and put on a slip. In the morning 
remove slip, bathe, and dre.ss in clean clothes ir It can be aflforded ; if not, thoroughly air 
elothing by hanging it up during the night. Use clean diapers, and change often. 

JiuU 3.— Let the child sleep by Itself In a cot or cradle. Put to t>ed at regular hours, and 
t«ach to go to sleep wliboui being nursed in the arms. Give no cordUtl, toothing syrup, or 
tUeuing aropt, wUhoxU the advice uf a phytidan. Tfiey kill thousandx of children every year. 
If the chlla frets it is hungry or ill. Never quiet a child by caudy or cake. They are com- 
moD causes of diarrhea and other troubles. 

RuleA.—ia\ve the child plenty of fresh air. Give it plenty of pure cold water. Keep It 
oat of rooms where cooking or washing is going on. Excessive hi-ai kills children. 

Rule b.—Kee^ the liouse sweet and clean, cool, and well aired. In hot weather leave 
windows open day and night. Cook in the yard, in a shed, or in ibe garret. Whitewash 
wails every spring, and keep cellar clear of rubbish. Let no slops collect. Disinfect priviei 
and sinks tty a solution of copperas, and got your neighbors to riean up. 

RuU 6.— Ii tbe supply of breasi-mllk is ample, and the child thrives, gives no other food in 
hot weather. If the supply is short give guai's or cow's milk in addition. Nuise once in 
two or three hours by day, and as seldom as possible at night. Bemove child from breast 
as soon as It falls asleep, and never give tbe breast when overheated or fatigued. 

ifui«7.— if brought up by hand, give soat's milk, or cow's milk, and use no other fbod 
while hot weather lasts. For an infant tnai has not cut its front teeth, no subslUult for miik 
it mfe. Creeping children must not be allowed to pick up unwholesome food. 

J2u/«6.— If^miik is pure add one-third hot water to It until child ia three months old ; af- 
terwards gradually lessen the water. Sweeten each pint with a heaping dessert-spoon ftil 
of sugar of milk, or a teo-spoonfUl crushed sugar. When very hot weather give milk cold. 
It must be unskimmed and as fresh as possible, and brouqM, very early in the morning. Scald 
pans to be used with boiling suds. In very hot weather boil milk assoon as it comes, and 
remove to the coolest place in the house upuu ice or down in a well. In a warm room it 
floon spoils 

HuU 9.— If the milk disagrees add a Uble-spoon of lime-water to each botUeful. If pure 
milk can not be had. try condensed milk, sold at all grocers. Prepare by adding to six 
table-spoons boiling water, without sugar, one table-spoon or more of the milk, accord- 
ing to age of the cnild. If this disagrees, a tea-Kt)oon of arrow-root, of sago, or of corn- 
starch, may be added to a pint of milk, a.>i prepared under Itule 8, and cautiously tried. If 
milk can not be digested try, for a few d.iys. pure creaiii, diluted with three-fourths to 
four-flfths water, returning to milk as soon as poHslbie. 

RtUe 10.— The nursing-bottle mutt be kr^tt yttUctly clean, otherwise the milk will turn sour, 
and the child will be made ill. Empty atlei each meal, rinse tirst in cold water, take apart, 
and place nipple and bottle in clean water, to wliich u little soda has been added. It is bet- 
ter to have two bottles, and use them by turns. The plain bottle with rubber nipples is 
better than the tube, which is difficult to keep clean. 

Rule 11.— Do not wean a child Just before or during hot weather ; nor. as a rule, until after 
Its second summer. If suckling disagrees with the mother she must not wean the child, 
but feed it in part from the nursing bottle as directed. However Amall the supply of breant- 
milk, the mother should keep it upagaiust sickness. Jt will i\;un save l/u life, of a child 
when every thing else faiU. When over six months old the mother may save her strength 
by giving it one or two meals a da}' of stale bread and milk, which should be pressed 
tbrough a sieve, and put into a nursing bottle. When from eiKht months to a year old, it 
may have also one meal a day of the yolk of a fresh, rare boilea egg, or one of beef or mut- 
teu-broth, into which stale bread has been crumbled. When older ft can have a little meat, 
finely minoed ; but even then milk should be its principal food, and not what grown people 
usually eaL 

Jitde 12.— If a child is suddenly taken with vomiting, and purging, and prostration, send 
Ibr the doctor at once. Meantime, put the child fbr a few minutes in a hot bath, then 
carefully wipe dry with a warm towel, and wrap in warm blankets, if hands and teei are 
cold, apply bottles filled with hot water and wrapped in flannel. Place a mush poultice or 
flaxseed poultice to which one quarter part of mustard flour has i>een added, or flannels 
wrung out of hot vinegar and water, over the belly. Give every fifteen minutes, five drops 
braDoy in a teaspoonfiil of water; if vomiting continues, give the brandy in the same 
ttuantlty oi milk and lime-water. If the dlarrhcea has Just beguUi or if caused by improper 
iood, give a teaspoonfUl of castor-oil. or of spioed syrup of rhubarb. If the child has been 
fed partly on breast-milk, mother's milk alone must be used now. If weaned, dilute pure 
milk witn lime-water, or give weak beef-tea or chicken-water. Let child drink cold water 
freely. Bemove soiled diapers at once from the room but save lor the examination of the 
physician.

Jleanliness is next to godliness. 

Always rest before and after a hearty meal. 

Do not eat too much. Do not eat late at night. 

Food, especially bread, should never be eaten hot. 

Children should never be dressed in tight clothes. 

Never sit in a damp or chilly room without a fire. 

Supper just before going to bed is highly injurious. If hungry, a bit of 
bread or cracker will check the craving without spoiling sleep. 

Never enter a room where a person is sick with an infectious disease with 
an empty stomach. 

When really sick, send for a good physician ; and as you value your health 
and life, have Hothing to do wUh quacks or patent medicines. 

The condiments, pepper, ginger, etc., are less injurious in summer. Fat 
beef, bacon, and hearty food may be eaten more freely in winter. 

Let the amount of the meal bear some relation to future needs as well 
as present appetite; but it is better to carry an extra pound in your pocket 
than in your stomach. 

A small quantity of plain, nourishing soup is a wholesome first course at 
dinner. Rich soups are injurious to persons of weak digestion, and a large 
quantity of liquid food is not beneficial to adults. 

Three full meals daily are customary, but the number, the relative quantity 
and quality, and the intervals between them, are largely matters of opinion, 
habit and convenience; regularity is the important thing. 

Exercise before breakfast should be very light ; and it is better to take a 
cracker or some trifle before going out, especially in a miasmatic climate. 
Early breakfasts are a necessity to the young and growing. 

Remember that when the stomach is .sour after eating, the food is actually 
rotting — that is a nauseating word but it expresses the absolute fact in the 
case — and it means that some of the rules above given have been violated. 

Eat in pure air and in pleasant company; light conversation and gentle 
exercise promote digestion, but hard work of any kind retards it. Avoid se- 
vere bodily or mental labor just before and for two hours after a fui^ meaL 

Most people drink too much and too fast. A small quantity of water 
sipped slowly satisfies thirst as well as a pailful swallowed at a draughts 

Drinks at meals should be taken at the close, and not too strong or hot. 
Dyspeptics especially should drink s]>aringly. Children need more thaa 
adults, but too much is injurious. 

Adults need to eat at regular intervals two or three times a day, allowiag

time for each meal to be fully digested before another is taken. It would 
spoil a loaf of bread, half baked, to poke a lump of cold dough into the 
middle of it. 

Use good palatable food, not highly seasoned ; vary in quantity and quality 
according to age, climate, weather and occupation. Unbolted or partially 
bolted grains are good and sutticient food for men; but nature craves variety. 
As a rule, the flesh of meat-eating animals is not wholesome food. Hot 
8oft bread digests slowly. 

Don't eat too fast; the digestive organs are something like a stove, which 
if choked up and out of order, burns slowly, and if you keep piling in fuel, 
grows more and more choked. The wiser course is to let it burn down and 
put in fuel only when needed. It is a foolish notion that food always keeps 
up the strength. Only what we digest helps us; all beyond that is a tax 
upon the system, and exhausts the strength instead of increasing it. 

Masticate well ; five minutes more at dinner may give you better use of an 
hour afterward. At meals never drink a full glass of very hot or very cold 
liquid. Never wash down a mouthful. Avoid waste of saliva. 

Avoid tobacco, alcohol in all forms, and all stimulants. Every healthy 
man is better, stronger, has a clearer head, more endurance, and better 
chances for a long life, if free from the habitual use of stimulants. The 
boy who begins the use of tobacco or liquors early is physically ruined. 

Avoid colds and break up as soon as possible when taken. As soon as 
conscious that the pores are closed, keep warm within doors, drink warm 
ginger tea, relax the bowels, and take a vapor bath. Breaking a cold up 
early, often saves a severe attack of congestion, pneumonia, often even a 
fever. 

Panaceas aro prhiia facie humhnf;s; their makers and takers, their vendors 
and recommenders are knaves or fools, or both. Nature cures most diseases, 
if let alone or aided by diet and proper care. There are no miracles in 
medicine; remember that to keep or to got health generally requires only a 
recognition of Nature's powers, with knowledge of anatomy and physiology, 
experience, and common sense. 

Never sleep in clothing worn during the day. and let that worn at night 
be exposed to the air by day. Three pints of moisture, filled with the waste 
of the body, are given off every^ twenty-four hours, and mostlj' absorbed by 
clothing. Exposure to air and sunlight purifies the clothing and bedding of 
the poisons which nature is trying to get rid of, and which would otherwise 
be brought again into contact with the body. 

The lungs should be trained to free, full, and vigorous action. "The 
breath is the life." A man will exist for days without food, but when the 
breath is cut off life ceases. If breathing is imperfect, all the functions of 
the body work at a disadvantage. It is a common fault to breathe from 
the surface of the lungs only, not bringing into play the abdominal muscles, 
and so not filling the more remote air-cells of the lungs. By this defective 
action the system is deprived of a part of its supply of air, and by inaction 
the air-cells become diseased. 



558 HINTS FOR THE WELL. 

Evacuate the bowels daily, and, above all, regularly ; the best time is after 
breakfast; partly to be rid of a physical burden during the day, but chiefly 
to relieve the bowels. Constipation is safer than diarrhoea. For the former, 
exercise, ride horseback, knead the belly, take a glass of cool water before 
breakfast, eat fruit and laxative food ; for the latter, follow an opposite 
course — toast, crust, crackers and rice are the best food. Pain and uneasi- 
ness of digestive organs are signs of disturbance; keep a clear conscience; 
rest, sleep, eat properly ; avoid strong medicines in ordinary cases. 

Keep the person scrupulously clean ; change the clothing worn next to the 
skin (which should be tlannel) often. Don't economize in washing bills. A 
cold bath every morning for very vigorous persons, or once or twice a week 
and thorough rubbing with a coarse towel or flesh-brush mornings when 
bath is not taken, for the less robust, is necessary to keep the functions of 
the skin in health, and is very invigorating. After warm baths a dash of 
cold water will prevent chill and "taking cold." In bathing in winter, the 
shock from cold water is lessened by standing a minute in the cold air after 
the removal of clothing before applying water. 

A very prolific source of disease is defective drainage. In the country, 
slops and waste water are thrown into the back yard to trickle back into 
the well and pollute it, or to form a reeking cesspool which poisons the air. 
In cities, the sewer-connections with houses allow the foul gases to rush 
back through the waste-pipes to closets or sinks and into the house. Neat- 
ness will cure the first, and a flue connecting each system of drainage-pipes 
with the tallest chimney in the house where a fire is constantly used, will 
draw off and consume the gases in the second. 

It should be remembered that the use of chloride of lime, and other fu- 
migants, does not destroy filthiness, but only renders it less evident. Clean- 
liness, fresh air, and sunlight will purify. Cleanliness is a very strong word. 
Carpets filled with dust or grease, dirty furniture, or walls covered with old 
paper, defile the atmosphere as much as a refuse heap in the cellar or back 
yard. A dark house is generally unwholesome and dirty. The sunlight is 
second only in importance to fresh air. To convince one that light purifies, 
it is only necessary to go into a darkened room and note the corrupt smelL 

Ventilation can not be accomplished by simply letting the pure air in ; 
the bad air must be let out Open a window at top and bottom, hold a 
lighted candle in the draft, and see the flame turn outward at the top and 
inward at the bottom, showing the purifying currents. Windows on opposite 
sides of the room ventilate still more perfectly. In sleeping rooms, avoid 
"drafts'* when possible, but danger of taking cold from them may be 
averted by extra clothing. In living-rooms, an open fire-place or grate in- 
sures ventilation. The tise of close stoves, and close rooms, are the causes 
of the increased prevalence and fatality, in winter, of small pox, scarlet 
fever, and other contagions diseases. 

Colds are often, if not generally, the result of debility, and are preceded 
by disordered digestion. Such cases are prevented by a removal of the cause 
hy diet and pure air. Extreme cold or heat, and sudden exposure to cold 



HINTS FOR THE WELL. 569 

by passing from a heated room to cold outside air, is very injarious to the 
old or iireak. All such should avoid great extremes and sudden changes. 
In passing from heated assemblies to the cold air, the mouth should be kept 
closed, and the breathing done through the nostrils only, so that the cold 
air may be warmed before reaching the lungs, which have just been im- 
mersed in a hot-air bath. The injurious effect of such sudden changes is 
caused by driving the blood from the surface to the internal organs, pro- 
ducing congestions. 

Bad smells mean that decay is going on somewhere. Rotten particles 
are floating in the air, and penetrating the nostrils and lungs. Their ofTen- 
siveness means that they are poison, and will produce sickness and death, ur 
80 reduce the tone of the system that ordinarily luild disorders will prove 
fatal. In all such cases remove the cause when possible. Many of these 
poisons are given off by the body, and are removed by pure air, as dirt is 
washed away by water. Soiled or foul air can not purify any more than 
dirty water will clean dirty clothes. Pure air enters the lungs, becomes 
charged with waste particles, which are poison if taken back again. An 
t^n\t spoils one gallon of pure air every minute^ or twenty-five flour barrelfuls 
in a single night, in breathing alone. A lighted gas-burner consumes eleven 
gallons, and an ordinary stove twenty-five gallons a minute. Think of these 
facts before sealing up the fire-place, or nailing down the windows for 
winter. 

Let the sunshine into every room in the house. The sunlight is a great 
purifier. Keep the cellar not only clean and sweet, but give it fresh air and 
good ventilation, or it will poison the rest of the house. 

Tf one is accustomed to sleeping with windows open, there is no danger of 
taking cold (rom the exposure, winter or summer. People who shut up 
windows to keep out " night air," make a mistake. At night, the only air 
to breathe is ** night air.** A bed that has been made up for a week or longer 
is not fit to sleep in. It has gathered moisture and should be aired. When 
fixed wash-bowls stand in sleeping^rooms, the waste-pipe should be carefully 
dosed, as sewer gases often escape through them into the room. 

Many of the colds which people are said to catch, commence at the feet To 
keep these extremities warm, therefore, is to effect an insurance against the 
almost interminable list of disorders which spring out of a "slight cold.** 
First, never be tightly shod. Boots and shoes, when they fit closely, press 
against the foot and prevent a free circulation of the blood. When, on the 
contrary, they do not embrace the foot too tightly the blood gets fair play, 
and the places left between the leather and the stockings are filled with a 
comfortable supply of warm air. The second rule is, never to sit in damp 
shoes. It is often imagined that unless they are positively wet it is not 
necessary to change them while the feet are at rest This is a fallacy ; for 
when the least dampness is absorbed into the sole, it is attracted nearer to 
the foot itself by its own heat, and thus perspiration is dangerously checked. 
Any person may prove tliis, by trying the experiment of neglecting this rule, 
and his feet will become cold and damp after a few moments, although, 
liking off the shoe and warming it, it will appear quite dry. 



660 HINTS FOR THE WELL, 

Remember that there is no patent medicine or " patent pad," warranted 
to "cure by absorption," that will absorb "disease half as rapidly as a wet 
towel wrapped arolind the body, and covered with a dry flannel. If people 
were required to pay $10 each for this " valuable secret " there would be no 
difficulty in getting millions of testimonials to its efficacy. It is too cheap 
to be popular with people who liked to be humbugged ; but when humbugs 
all fail, try hot and cold water. 

One of the most prominent writers on health topics says: "The great 
practical lesson which I wish to inculcate, to be engraven as on a plate of 
steel, on the memory of diildren and youth, j-oung men and women, the 
mature and the gray -headed: AHcno nothing short of fire or endangered life to 
induce you to resist^ for one single moment, nature^s alvine call. So far from 
refusing a call for any reason short of life and death, you should go at th* 
utual time and solicit, and doing so you will have your reward in a degree 
of health fulness, and in a length of life, which very few are ever i)ermitted 
to enjoy. If the love of health and life, or the fear of inducing painful 
disease can not induce you to adopt the plan I have recommended, there is 
another argument which, to young gentlemen and young ladies, may appear 
more convincing— j?«r«on«^ cleanliness. [If you suffer yourself to become 
and remain costive you will smell badly ; the breath of a costive child even is 
scarcely to be endured.] Cold feet, sick headache, piles, fistulas, these, with 
scores of other diseases, have their first foundations laid in constipation, 
which itself is infallibly induced by resisting nature's first calls. Reader, let 
it be your wisdom never to do it again." 

A Dyspeptic's Fight for Life. 

Judge W. was a depressed, despondent, discouraged, listless, moody, nerv- 
ous, wretched dyspeptic, for five weary years. He tried travel, but neither 
the keen air of the sea-shore nor the bracing breezes of the northern prairies 
brought him relief. He tried all the panaceas and all the doctors at home 
and abroad in vain. Some told him that he had heart-disease, others thought 
it was inflammation of the spleen, gout, Bright's disease, liver complaint, 
lung difficulty, or softening of the brain. Bottle after bottle of nostrums 
went down the unfortunate man's throat, and it was only when physicians 
and friends gave him up, and pronounced him to all intents a dead man, 
that he threw bottles, plasters, powders and pill§ to the four winds, and, with 
the energy of despair, set about disappointing his doctors, and getting ready 
to live despite their ghastly predictions. Then began a fight for life against 
dyspepsia, a fight which many have begun, but few have won. He bathed 
the whole body every morning in cold water, summer and winter, not by a 
shower or a plunge, but by vigorously dashing the water on the body with the 
hands, and afterwards rubbing briskly with a coarse towel. This was con- 
tinued without missing a single morning for years. In the meantime the 
strictest diet was instituted. By experimenting, the patient found what he 
could eat without harm, and ate that only in very small quantities, meas- 
uring his food on his plate before beginning his meal, and limiting himself 
rigidly to that quantity. His principal food for nearly three years was 



HINTS FOR THE WELL. 561 

cracked wheat and Graham mush, and the last meal was taken at two o'clock 
in the afternoon — not a particle of food passed his lips from that time until 
the next morning, thus giving the stomach complete rest and time to begin 
the work of recuperation. Special attention was given to eating slowly and 
thoroughly masticating the food ; and not to eat too much, too fast, or too 
often, were rules strictly and rigidly observed. Bathing, diet, rest, sleep, and 
gentle exercise in the open air did the work. It was a dreadful conflict — 
days of struggle and temptation, requiring more heroism and steady tenacity 
of purpose than would nerve a soldier for battle, for such a battle is for the 
day, but this fight was renewed every morning and continued every day for 
months and years. But patience, courage, intelligent judgment, and a strict 
adherence to the above regimen won the day without a grain or a drop of 
medicine, and Judge W. believes that the good Lord of us all has never per- 
mitted any man to discover or invent medicine that will cure dyspepsia. 
Nature is the only perfect physician. Cold water, fresh air, the natural 
frain (wheat), sleep, rest, and gentle exercise, make up the grand panacea^ 
With these alone, and the self-denial and moral courage to persist in the 
good fight, the confirmed, nervous, miserable dyspeptic, became a well, 
strong, and hearty man — in five days? No. In five months? No. In five 
years? Yes; and after the fight, when contemplating the victory won. he 
could say with the model philanthropist, Amos Lawrence, after his battle 
of fifteen long y^ars with the same disease, ** If men only knew how sweet tlie 
▼ictory is, thev would not hesitate a moment to engage in the conflict.*' 



HINTS FOR THE SICK-ROOM. 



The sick-room should be the lightest, most cheerfal, and best ventilated 
room in the house. Patients in the sunny wards of liospitals recover 
soonest, and the sick, in nearly all cases, lie with their faces to the light. 
Every thing should be kept in perfect neatness and order. Matting i9 
better than a carpet, though, when the latter is used, it may be kept cleao 
by throwing a few damp tea*leaves over only a part of the room at a time^ 
then quietly brushing them up with a hand-broom. A table not liable 
to injury, a small wicker basket with compartments to hold the different 
bottles of medicine and a small book in which to write all the physician*B 
directions, two baskets made on the same plan to hold glasses or cups» 
screens to shade the light from the eyes of the patient, a nursery-lamp 
with which to heat water, beef-tea, etc., a quill tied on the door-handle 
with which the nurse can notify others that the patient is asleep by merely 
passing the feather-end through the key-hole, several "ring cushions** to 
^ve relief to patients compelled to lie continually in one position (these 
cushions are circular pieces of old linen sewed together and stuffed with 
bran ; or pads may be used, made of cotton-batting basted into pieces of 
old muslin of any size required), and a sick couch or chair, are a few of 
the many conveniences which ought to be in every sick-room. 

Pure air in a sick-room is of the utmost importance. In illness, the poi- 
soned body is desperately trying to throw off, through lungs, skin, and in 
every possible way, the noxious materials that have done the mischief. 
Bad air and dirty or saturated bed-clothes, increase the difficulty at the very 
time when the weakened jwwers need all the help they can get Avoid 
air from kitchen or close closeta Outside air is the best, but, if needed, 
there should be jk fire in the room to take off the chill. A cold is rarely 
taken in bed, with the bed-clothes well tucked in, but oftener in getting up 
out of a warm bed when the skin is relaxed. Of course any thing like a 
" chill " should be avoided, and it is not well to allow a draft or current of 
air to pass directly over the bed of the patient 

A good way to secure a supply of fresh air, without a draft, is to have a 
board five or six inches wide, and as long as the width of the window; raise 
the lower sash, place board under it, and the fresh air finds its way in be- 
tween the sash by an upward current 

In disease less heat is produced by the body than in health. This decline 
occurs even in summer, and is usually most evident in the early morning, 
when the vital powers slacken, the food of the previous day having been 
exhausted. The sick should be watched between midnight and ten or 



HINTS FOB THE SICK-ROOM. 563 

« 

eleven in the rooming, and if any decline in heat is noticed, it should he 
flupplied by jugs of hot water. A sick-room should, above all, be quiet. 
Any rustling SQund, such as that of a silk dress or shoes which creak, should 
be entirely avoided. If it is necessary to put coal on the* fire, drop it on 
quietly in small paper sacks, or rolled in paper slightly dampened. Visitors 
should never be admitted to a sick-room. The necessary attendants are usu- 
ally a sufficient annoyance to a weak patient, and many a tombstone might 
truthfully and appropriately be inscribed, "Talked to death by well-meaning 
friends." It is not generally the loudness of a noise that disturbs the sick, 
but the sound that produces expectation of something to happen. Some 
can not bear any noise. Any thing that suddenly awakens is injurious. 
Never awaken a sleeping patient unless ordered to do so by the physician. 
In sickness, the brain is weakened with the rest of the body, and sleep 
strengthens it. If rest is interrupted soon after it is begun, the brain is 
weakened so much the more, and the patient becomes irritable and wake- 
ful. If sleep lasts longer, he falls asleep again more readily. Never speak 
within the hearing of the sick, in tones which can not be fully understood. 
An occasional word, or murmur of conversation, or whisper, is intolerable, 
and occasions needless apprehension. 

Few persons have any idea of the exquisite neatness necessary in a sick- 
room. What a well person might endure with impunity, may prove fatal to 
a weak patient. Especially the bed and bedding should be scrupulously 
clean. In most diseases the functions of the skin are disordered, and the 
clothing becomes saturated with foul perspiration, so that the patient alter- 
nates between a cold damp after the bed is made, and a warm damp before, 
both poison to his system. Sheets which are used should be dried often 
from this poisonous damp, either in the sun or by the fire, and the mattress 
and blanket next the sheets should also be carefully aired as often as pos- 
sible. In changing very sick patients (particularly women after confinement) 
the sheets and wearing-clothes should be well aired by hanging by the fire 
for two days. Move the patient close to one side of the bed, turn the 
under sheet over close to the invalid, then smooth the mattress, removing 
any thing that may be on it. Make ready the clean sheet, by rolling one- 
half into a round roll, lay this close by the invalid, spread the other half 
smoothly over the bed. Now assist the patient on the clean sheet, unroll 
and spread over the other side of the bed. Have the upper sheet ready, 
which must be carefully and gently laid over the invalid, then add the other 
bed-clothes. (In dressing a blister where a bandage has to be placed around 
the body, roll one-half the bandage, place It under the invalid, so that the 
attendant at the other side can reach it, unrolling, and placing it around 
the patient without disturbing him.) Light blankets are best for coverings. 
Never use the impervious cotton counterpanes and comforters. The clothing 
should be as light as possible with the requisite warmth. The bed should 
be low, and placed in the light, and as a rule the pillows should be low, so 
as to give the lungs free play. Scrofula is sometimes caused by children 
sleeping with their heads under the clothing, and patients sometimes ac- 
quire the same injurious habit. 



564 HJ^TS FOR THE SICK-ROOM. 

Bathing should aWays be done under the advice of a physician, but soap 
and water are great restoratives. In most cases, washing an^ properly dry- 
ing the skin gives great relief. Care should be taken, while sponging and 
cleansing, not to expose too great a surface at a time, so as to check per- 
spiration. The physician will regulate the temperature. Sometimes a little 
vinegar, whisky, or alcohol added to the water, makes the bath more re- 
freshing, and bay-rum for the face, neck, and hands is often acceptable. 
Whenever the bath is followed by a sense of oppression, it has done harm. 
Its eti'ect should be comfort and relief. 

Chamber utensils should be emptied and thoroughly cleansed immedi- 
ately after using, and in no case allowed to remain standing in the sick- 
room. Slop-pails, into wliich nothing should be allowed to go except tb© 
waste water from the \va*h j>tand, must be emptied and cleansed thoroughly 
at least twice a day. 

It is well for both nurse and patient to remember that nothing relieves 
nausea or vomiting sooner than drinking hot water in as great quantity and 
as hot as possible. Placing the hands in hot water up to the wrists, a flan- 
nel or other cloth, dipped in hot water and laid five or six folds thick, on 
any pained part, will relieve suffering more promptly tlian all the pain- 
killers in the world. Cover the wet flannel with another dry one, the e<lges 
of which extend over the wet one an inch or more. In about five minutes 
slip the wet flannel out and put in its place another as hot as can be han- 
dled, taking care to let as little cold air as jwssible touch the skin over 
which the hot flannel has been applied. IjVhen pain is relieved, put on 
towels wet in cool water and cover with flannel ; leave for an hour or more, 
remove and wipe dry, rubbing vigorously. These hot applications will often 
relieve a violent, dry cough in a few minutes, and in some forms of croup 
will cure in half an hour. 

Patients are often killed by kindness. A spoonful of improper food, or 
the indulgence of some whim, may prove fatal. A physician's directions 
should always be observed with the strictest fidelity. Medicines and things 
which will be wanted during the night should all be prepared before the 
patient grows sleepy. Every thing should be done quickly but quietly, and 
with precision. In talking, sit where the patient can see you without turn- 
ing his head. Never ask questions when he is doing any thing, and never 
lean or sit upon the bed. Sick persons generally prefer to be told any 
thing rather than to have it read to them. A change in the ornaments of 
the room is a great relief, and the sick especially enjoy bright and beautiful 
things. Flowers, which do not have a pungent odor, are always a great 
delight. 

In convalescence great care is necessary, and the physician's directions 
should be implicitly obeyed, especially in regard to diet; a failure in obedi- 
ence often brings on a fatal relapse, A little food at a time and often re- 
peated, is the general rule for the sick. A table-spoon of beef-tea, every 
half hour, will be digested, when a cupful every three or four hours will bo

fonnd agreat convenience.) The sick can rarely take solid food before eleven in 
the morning, and a spoonful of beef- tea, or whatever stimulant the physician 
has ordered, given every hour or two, relieves exhaustion. Brandy, whisky, 
or other alcoholic stimulants, however, should never be ordered in cases 
where there is a hereditary tendency to use then\, or where they have been 
used as a beverage, or where the associations of the patient in the future 
would be likely to make an acquired taste for them a temptation. In most 
cases substitutes may readily be found. Untouched food should never be 
left at tlie bed-side. Every meal should be a surprise, and the patient should 
be left alone while eating. Food for the sick must be of the best quality, 
and neatly and delicately i)repared. The cook should do half the patients 
digesting. Keep the cup and saucer dry, so that no drops will fall on the 
bed or clothing. 

Beef- tea contains a certain amount of nourishment, and may be given 
in almost any inflammatory disease. Eggs do not agree with all patients, 
but are nourishing food when admissible. Tenderloin of beef, cut ncrosa 
the grain, and broiled on live coals, without smoke, and well cooked or 
rare, as tlie physician may direct, is always relished; and a tender lamb> 
chop, broiled in the same way, with the fat removed before serving, is 
easily digested and nutritious. Roasted potatoes, very mealy, are prefer- 
red to other vegetables. Milk is a representative diet; and, when it agrees 
with the digestion, is probably better adapted to .strengthen the lx)dy in 
sickness than any other one article of food, but it must be fresh and pure. 
The least taint of sourness is injurious. Butter-milk, however, when fresh, 
is useful in fevers, bilious diseases and dyspo j>sia. Cream is even better 
than milk, and is less apt to turn acid in the stomach. Many patients 
thrive on Indian-meal mush and cream, and any preparations of Indian- 
meal are especially good for persons who are suffering from the loss of natural 
warmth (see Bread-making). Oat-meal, Graham and rye mush, and home- 
made brown-bread, are important articles of diet, greatly relished by the 
sick. There are instances of jK^rsons recovering from serious illness where 
a table-spoon of rye mush, and half tea-cup butter-milk, three times a day, 
were all that cculd be taken for two or three weeks. A patient's craving 
for any particular article of food should l>e coniniunicated to the physi- 
cian, as it is often a valuable indication of tlie wants of the sj'stem. These 
cravings should be gratified whenever possible. Melons act on the kidneys, 
and are good in many cases of fever, bowel complaint, etc. Celery also is 
good in some diseases of the kidneys, and in nervousness and rheumatism. 
Fresh, crisp, raw cabbage, sliced fine and eaten with good vinegar, is easily 
digested, and often highly relished by a patient suffering from a "weak 
stomach." New cider is also excellent in many cases of nervous dj'spep- 
sia. Fruits and berries — raw, ripe and perfect — used in moderation, are 
admirable remedies in cases of constipation and its attendant diseases. 
The grape has a wide range of curative qualities. The seeds are excel- 
lent for costiveneas; the pulp is very nutritious and soothing^ to irritated 
bowels, while the skins, if chewed, act as an astringent. Raw beef is ex-

cellent in dysentery; it should be minced very fine, and given in doses 
of a spoonful at a time every four hours, the patient, in the meantime, 
eating nothing else. Bananas or baked apples are good in chronic diai^ 
rhoea. A rind of bacon is good for teething children to chew. Rice-water 
or rice-jelly arc advisable in many cases of convalescence from acute fever, 
summer complaint and like diseases. Fresh {x>p-corn, nicely salted, clam- 
broth, the juice of a roasted oyster in the shell, soda-water and pepper- 
mint-tea are remedies for sick stomach. Vegetable acid drinks, herb-teas, 
toast-water, and all such drinks are often much relished. A custard made 
from a preparation of liquid rennet, as directed on bottle, is a delicate 
dish. Buttered-toast, either dry or dipped, though so generally given, is 
rarely a suitable article for the sick, as melted oils are very difficult of diges- 
tion. In quinsy, diphtheria, inflammation of lungs, typhus and other putrid 
fevers, acids are of very great benefit. Take a handful of dried currants, 
l^bur Over them a pint of boiling water, let them stand half a minute with- 
out stirring, then drain off the water, strain it through a cloth, and set it away 
to cool; when given to the patient, dilute well, so that the acid taste is very 
alight. Acid- fruits should be eaten early in the day. Above all, it should 
be remembered, that it is not the nourishment which food contains, but 
thai which the stomach can assimilate^ that builds up; a sick person will thrive 
on what would not sustain a well man. 

It is of the utmost importance that the food be delicately and carefully 
administered, and this should never be left to servants. It should be made 
as attractive as possible, served in the choicest ware, with the cleanest of 
napkins, and the brightest of silver. If tea is served, it should be freshly 
drawn, in a dainty cup, with a block of white sugar, and a few drops of 
sweet cream. Toast should be thin, symmetrical, well yellowed, free from 
crust, and just from the fire. Steak should be a cut of the best tenderloin, 
delicately broiled, and served with the nicest of roasted potatoes. The atten- 
tion given to these simple matters is, in many cases, worth more than the 
physician's prescriptions. 

The craving for tea and coffee is almost universal with the sick. A moder- 
ate quantity is a great restorative; but an excess, especially of coffee, im- 
pairs digestion. Neither should be given after five in the afternoon, as 
they increase excitement and cause sleeplessness ; but sleeplessness from ex- 
haustion in the early morning is often relieved by a cup of tea or coffee. 
The patient's taste will decide which should be used. In cases of thirst, 
the physician will prescribe what other drink should be given to satisfy it 
Cocoa is not often craved by the sick, and possesses no stimulating qualities. 
Crust-coffee is very nourishing. 

A very simple means of refreshing the nurse, and a valuable disinfectant, 
if the nature of the invalid's complaint does not forbid it — that is seldom 
the case — is to put some pure, fresh-ground coffee on a saucer, or other dish, 
and iix the center place a very small piece of camphor-gum, and touch a 
match to it. As the gum bums, allow sufficient coffee to consume to per« 
vade the atmosphere with the aroma; it is wonderful in its invigorating 
•ffects. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK 567 

The following recipe makes a deliciona, refreshing and cooling wash for 
the sick-room : 

Take of rosenuiry, wormwood, lavender, rue, sage and mint a lai^ hand* 
ful of each. Place in a stone jar, and turn over it one gallon of strong cider 
vinegar, cover closely, and keep near the fire for four days; then strain, and 
add one ounce of pounded camphor-gum. Bottle and keep tightly corked. 

There is a French legend connected with this preparation (called vinaigrt 
a qiuUre voleiirs). Burlng the plague at Marseilles, a band of robben plun- 
dered the dying and the dead without injury to themselves. They were im- 
prisoned, tried and condemned to die, but were pardoned on condition of 
disclosing the secret whereby they could ransack houses infected with the 
terrible scouiige. They gave the above recipe. Another mode of using it, is 
to wash the face and hands with it before exposing one's self to any infec- 
tion. It is very aromatic and refreshing in the sick-room ; so, if it can ac- 
complish nothing more, it is of great value to nurses.

stirred, mix carefully together, and season slightly, and serve. 

To Prevent Wearin(^ Through the Skin when Bed-Ridden. — Apply to 
tender parts of the body with a feather, a mixture made by beating to a 
strong froth, the white of an egg, dropping in while beating two tea-spoons 
spirits of wine. Bottle for use. 

To Drop Medicine. — Shake the bottle so as to moisten the cork. With

animal food is not allowed. 

Currant Shrub. — Make the same as jelly, but boil only ten minutes; 
when cool, bottle and cork tight, (see directions for canned fruits). Raspberry, 
strawberry and blackberry shrubs are made in the same way ; when used, 
put in two-thirds ice-water. 

Oat-meal Blanc-mange. — A delicious blanc-mange is made by stirring

done, remove the burned parts, if any, season slightly with butter, pepper 
and salt, and serve at once. 

Arrowroot Custard. — One table-spoon of arrowroot, one pint of milk. 
one egg, two table-spoons sugar; mix the arrowroot with a little of the cola 
milk ; put the rest of milk on the fire and boil, and stir in the arrowroot 
and egg and sugar, well beaten together; scald and i)Our into cups to cool; 
any flavoring the invalid prefers may be added. 

Cinnamon Tea. — To a half-pint fresh, new milk add stick or ground cin- 
namon enough to tlavor, and white sugar to taste ; bring to boiling point, 
and take either warm or cold. Excellent for diarrhoea in adults or chil- 
dren. A few drops or a tea-spoon of brandy may be added, if the case 
demands. 

Tapioca Jelly. — One half pint tapioca, one quart water, juice and some 
of the grated rind of a lemon ; soak the tapioca for three or four hours in the 
water, sweeten it and boil for one hour in a custard-kettle, or until quite clear, 
stirring it often. When almost done, stir in the lemon, and when sufficiently" 
cooked, pour into molds. Serve with sweetened cream. 

Saoo Jelly-pudding. — Wash thoroughly one tea-cup of sago, cook it in 
three pints of water fifteen or twenty imnutes, till perfectly clear, add a 
very little salt; stir in half a jelly-glass of currant, grape or other jelly 
ancl two spoonfuls sugar. Mold and serve cold with cream and sugar ; or, 
eat warm. 

Graham Gems for Invalids. — Mix Graham flour with half milk and 
half water, add a little salt, beat, making the batter thiti enough to pour; 
have the gera-pan very hot, grease it, fill as quickly as possible and return 
immediately to a hot oven ; bake about thirty minutes. Practice will teach 
just the proper consistency of the batter, and the best temperature of the 
oven. It will not be good unless well beaten. 

Panada. — Take two richest crackers, pour on boiling water, let stand a few 
minutes, beat up an egg, sweeten to taste, and stir all together; grate in 
nutmeg and add brandy or wine to suit the invalid. Or, break in a pint bowl 
toasted bread and pour over boiling water, adding a small lump of butter, 
two table-spoons wine, brandy or whisky; sweeten to taste ana flavor with 
nutmeg or cinnamon. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Pour over two quarts of raspberries in a stone jar, 
one quart of very best vinegar; let stand twenty-four hours, strain, and 
pour liquor over fresh fruit, and let stand in the same way; allow one pound 
sugar to a pint of juice; put into a stone jar and set in pot of boiling wat«r 
one hour; skim well, put into bottles, cork and seal tight. Diluted with 
water this is very nice for the sick. Toasted bread may be eaten with it. 

Rice Jelly. — Mix one heaping table-spoon of rice-flour with cold water 
until it is a smooth paste, add a scant pint of boiling water, sweeten with 
loaf-sugar; boil until quite clear. If the jelly is intended for a patient 
with summer complaint, stir with a stick of cinnamon ; if for one with 
fever, flavor with lemon juice, and mold. Rice-water is made in the same 
manner, by using twice the quantity of boiling water. 

Royal Strawberry Acid. — Take three pounds ripe strawberries, two 
ounces citric acid, and one quart of water ; dissolve the acid in the water, 
and pour it over the berries; let them stand in a cool place twenty-four 
hours, draw off, and pour in three pounds more of berries, and let it stand 
twenty-four hours. Add to the liquor its own weight of sugar, boil three or 
four minutes each day for three days, then cork tightly and seal. Keep In 
a dry and cool place. 

Strawberry Acid. — Dissolve five ounces tartaric acid in two quarts of 
water, and pour it upon twelve pounds of strawberries in a porcelain ket- 
tle; let it simmer forty-eight hours; strain it, taking care not to bruise the 
fruit. To every pint of juice add one and one-half pounds of sugar and stir 
until dissolved, then leave it a few days. Bottle and cork lightly ; if a slight 
fermentation takes place leave the cork out a few days. Then cork, seal 
aud keep bottles in a cold place.

570 FOOD FOR THE SICK, 

Black BBRRT Wine. — ^To every gallon of bruised berries, add half a gal- 
lon of soft cold water; let stand twenty-four hours, then strain. To every 
gallon juice, add three pounds sugar; lili a cask and let it remain witlioat 
n: >ving or shaking until it has fermented, which it will have done in six 
weeks. Put over the mouth of the cask a thin piece of muslin. Wben 
fermentation has ceased, draw off the wine and bottle without shaking the 
cask. Cork and seal. 

Oat-meal Cakes.— Take e<^ual parts fine oat-meal and water; mix and 
pour into a pan about one- third of an incli deep and bake half an hour, or 
until crisp and slightly brown ; or make half an inch thick and bake soft like 
a johnny-cake ; or if the oven is not hot enough to bake, pour it into a fry- 
ing-pan, cover it and bake it on the top of the stove, dishing it when brown 
on tlie bottom. It is not good cold. If any be left, warm it up and it is al- 
most as good as new. 

Oat-meal Pie-crust. —This is made exactly like the dough for crackers; 
it may be rolled a verjr little thinner. It bakes quickly, so that care must 
be taken not to scorch it in cooking the contents of the pie. It is not suited 
for an upper crust, but does admirably for pies that require but one crust. 
It is just the thing for those who do not think shortened pie-crusts whole- 
some, and it is good enough for any one. One can eat it with as much im- 
punity as so much oat-meal mush and fruit sauce. 

Mutton Broth. — Put two pounds of mutton and two quarts cold water to 
boil, add one table-spoon rice washed carefully through several waters. Let 
it boil till the meat will leave the bone, and the rice is cooked to a liquid 
mass. Take from the fire, season with a little salt; skin, if preferred. If 
for a patient w^ith flux leave on all the fat (the more fat the better). 

This is also a nice way to make chicken broth. Take a chicken size of a 
quail and prepare as above. 

Uncooked Kgo. — This is quite palatable, and very strengthening, and 
may be prepared in a variety of ways. Break an egg into a goblet and beat 
thoroughly, add a tea-spoon sugar, and' after beating a moment add a tea- 
spoon or two of brandv or port wtine ; beat well and add as much rich milk, 
or part cream and milk, as there is of the mixture. Or, omit brandy and 
flavor with any kind of spice; or, milk need not be added, or the egg may 
be beaten separately, stirring in lightly the w^ell-whipped whites at the lasL 

Cracked Wheat Pudding. — To one quart new or unskimmed milk add 
one-third cup cracked wheat, same of sugar (or a little more if preferredX a 
little salt and small piece of stick cinnamon. Place in moderate oven and 
bake two hours or longer. When about half done stir in the crust already 
formed, and it will form another sufficiently brown. When done the wheat 
will be very soft, and the pudding of a creamy consistency. It can be eaten 
hot or cold, and is nice for invalids. A handful of raisins added is consid- 
ered an improvement by some. 

Broiled Beefsteak. — Many times a small piece of "tenderloin " or "por- 
terhouse" is more wholesome, for an invalid, than broths and teas; and with 
this may be served a potato, roasted in the ashes, dressed with sweet cream 
(or a little butter) ana salt, or nicely cooked tomatoes. Have the steak from 
half an inch to an inch thick, broil carefully two or three minutes over hot 
coals, turning often with a knife and fork, so as not to pierce it When 
done, put on a small dish, season slightly with salt and pepper, and a smaU 
bit of butter, garnish with the potato, and serve hoi. 

Stewed Oysters. — Remove all bits of shell from a half dozen frtth^ select 
oysters, place in a colander, pour over a tea-cup of water, drain, place liquor, 
drained off in a porcelain-lined sauce-pan, let come to boiling point, skim 
well ; pour off into another heated dish, all except the last spoonful which 
will contain sediment and bits of shell which may have been overlooked, 
wipe out sauce-pan, return liquor, add oysters, let come to the boiling point, 
add a small lump of grK)d butter, a tea-spoon of crackeivdust, a very little 
oayenne pepper and i^t, and a half tea-cup fresh, sweet cream.

To Make Kitmyss. — ^Take three quarts of good, rich, sweet milk; one 
qnart of hot water, in which dissolve one-half pint sugar ; add the hot 
water to the milk; when this mixture is lukewarm add three table-spoons of 
brewer's yeast; set in a moderately warm place, stir often, and, when it 
begins to sparkle (which will be in about one and a half hours J, put it into 
strong bottles and cork tight; put in a cool place and in eight hours it will 
be ready for use. Procure a champagne tap (cost $1), and draw the best 
kumyss ever made. 

Prepared Flour for Summer Complaint. — Take a double handful of 
flour, tie up tightly in cloth and put in a kettle of boiling water, boil from 
three to six hours, take out, remove the cloth, and you will have a hard, 
round ball. Keep in a dry, cool place, and when wanted for use, prepare 
by placing some sweet milk (new always preferred^ to boil, and grating into 
the milk from the ball enough to make it as thick as you desire, stirnng it 
just before removing from the stove with a stick of cinnamon ; this gives it 
A pleasant flavor; put a little salt into the milk. Very good for children 
having summer complaint. 

Milk Porridoe. — Place on stove in skillet one pint new sweet milk and a 
very little pinch of salt; when it boils have ready sifted flour, and sprinkle 
"With one hand into the boiling milk, stirring all the while with a spoon. 
Keep adding Hour until it is about the consistency of thick molasses; eat 
warm with a little butter and su^ar. This is excellent for children suffering 
with summer complaint. Or, mix the flour with a little cold milk until a 
smooth paste, and then stir into the boiled milk. Or, break an egg into the 
dry flour and rub it with the hands until it is all in fine crumbs (size of a 
grain of wheat), then stir this mixture into the boiling milk. 

Bran Biscuits. — ^Take cup bran (as prepared by Davis & Taylor, 24 Canal 
Street, Boston), five cups sifted flour; scald the bran at tea-time with half 

Eint boiling water; when cool, pour it into the middle of the flour, add one- 
alf cup good yeast (or part of a yeast-cake, soaked till light), one tea-spoon 
salt, and two table-spoons sugar ; wet with new milk into soft dough, much 
thicker than batter. Let it stand, covered closely, in a warm place to rise. 
In the' morning, spoon into hot gem or patty-pans, and bake in a quick oven 
to a brown crust. Part of the dough may be baked in a small loaf to be 
eat«n warm. (It can be made with water by using a little butter, but is not 
so good.) Any remaining may be split for ainner or toasted for tea. 

Oat-meal Wafers. — Use equal parts water and oat-meal, make as thin as 
you can shake it out on the bottom of pan, so that when done it will not be 
thicker than a knife-blade anywhere, and in most places you can see day- 
light through it. Bake very slowly until quite dry, watching that it may not 
scorch. In taking out it will probably break into many fragments, but they 
will be delicious ones — not shapely for the table, but so temptingly savored 
that any delicate person who can eat at all will find them satisfying, nour- 
ishing, and easily digested — ^far better than the standard sick dish called 
gruel. As for the well folks, put your wafers out of the way if you expect 
to find any of them for the invalid's next meal. 

Blackberry Cordial. — Put a half bushel of blackberries in a preserv- 
ing-kettle and cook until scalded through well; strain and press out all the 
juice; put juice in kettle With the following spices well broken up and put 
into a bag ; one-quarter pound allspice, two ounces cinnamon-bark, two 
ounces cloves, and two nutmegs ; add loaf-sugar, about one pound to every 
quart of juice or more if preferred, and cook slowly ten or fifteen minutes, 
remove from the fire, let cool a little, and add good pure brandy in the pro- 
portion of one pint to every three pints of juice. A smaller quantity may 
De made, using the same proportions. This is an excellent remedy for di- 
arrhoea and other diseases of the bowels. 

Good Toast. — Toast slices of bread, scrape off any blackened, charred 
portion ; lay on a soup-plate, pour on cold milk enough to wet through, and 
leave half an inch or so in depth of milk in the plate. Good milk, with a 



572 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

little extra cream in it, is all the better, ami a very trirte of salt improves 
it. Put over the toast thus ^)repared, an inverted large earthen bowl, or tin 
basin, large enough to cover it and set down u|>on the plate all round. Put 
this in a warm, not very hot, stove oven, two, three, or more hours in ad- 
vance. The milk will cook an<l evaporate and it.s substance be condensed 
in the toast, while the cover will keep the toai<t moist. It is then very good 
without butler, though a little may be used if desired. 

Beef Bkoth. — Cut in snuill nieces one pound of good lean beef; put on 
in two quarts of cold water and boil slowly, keeping it well covered, one and 
one-halt liours; then add half a tea-cup tapioca, wliich lias been soaked 
three-(iuartcrs of an hour in water enough to cover, and boil half an hour 
long«^r. SSonie add, with the tapi(>ca, a small bit of parsley, and a slice or 
two of (Jiiion. Strain before serving, seasoning sliglitly with pepper and 
salt. It is more strengthening to add, just before serving, a .soft poached 
egg. Kice may Ik? used instead of taiuoca, straining the broth, and adding 
one or two table-spoons rice (soaked for a short time), and then boiling half 
an hour. 

Meat for Ixvalids. — The following /netluxl of rendering raw meat pal- 
atable to invalids is given by good authority. To 8.7 ounces of raw meat, 
from the loin, add 2.() ounces slielled sweet almonds. .17 ounces shelled 
bitter almonds, and 2.8 ounces white sugar — these to \>e beaten together in 
a marble mortar to a uniform pulj), and the fibers separated by a strainer. 
The pulp, wliich has a rosy hue, and a very agreeable tjusie, does not at all 
remind one of meat, and may be kej)! fn-sh for a considerable time, even 
in summer, in a drv, cool place. Yolk (;f egg may he added to it. From 
this pulp, or directly from tlie above substince, an emulsion may be pre- 
pared which will he rendered still more nutritious by adding milk. 

Articles for the Sick-room. — A rubber bag, holding two quarts, to be 
one-half or tlirm;-quarters filled with Iiot water, and placed about the patient 
where needed — under head in neuralgia, around the side in liver-congestion, 
etc.; or can ho filled witli very cold water in cases needing such applications 
— is very tlexihle and agreeable, and can be used where a boap-stone or bottle

yarn, without heels, to draw on towanU morning in fever cases, or to keep 
patient warm when she is up; they might come half way between the 
Knee and thigh. Every housekeeper should have a pair to be used in cases 
of sickness. 

Oat-meal Trackers. — "Wet one pint fine oat-meal with one gill water; 
work it a few minutes with a spoon, until you can make it up into a mass; 
place on a hoard well covered with dry oat-meal; mak(» as comjKict as you 
can, and roll out carefully to one-sixth of an inch thick, and cut into 
squares with a knife. Bake in a very slow oven, or merely scald at first; 
and then let them stand in the oven until they dry out. These are difficult 
to make u)) at first, but you soon learn to handle the dough and to watch 
oven so that they will not scorch. These are excellent for all the purpost»g 
of crackers, and if kept dry, or if packed in oat-meal, they will last good 
for months. This is one form of the Scotch "bannock." A rich addition 
is two heaping spoonsful of ground dessicated ^ocoanut 

Old-time Food for Convalescent.s. — Roast g(»od potatoes in hot ashea 
and coals; when done, put in a coarse doth and s<}ueeze with the hand, and 
take out the inside on a plate. Put a slice of good pickled jwrk on a stick 
three or four feet long, hold before a wood fire until it cooks slightly, then 
dip into a pan of water and let it drip on the potato tosea.son it; repeat until 
the meat is nicely cooked on one side, then turn the other, dip in water, etc. 
Wlien done place on plate beside the potato, serve with a slice of toast dressed 
with hot water and a little vinegar and salt, or use sweet cream instead of 
vinegar. A cup of sage tea, made by pouring boiling water on a few leaves 
of sage and allowing it to stand a few minutes, served with cream and sugar. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK 573 

Is very nice ; or crust coffee, or any herb tea is good. Food prepared in thi» 
way obviates the use of butter. 

Beef-Tea. — Cut pound best lean steak in small pieces, place in glass iruitr 
isLT {a. perfect one), cover tightly and set in a pot of cold water; heat gradu- 
ally to boil, and continue this steadily three or four hours, until the meat is 
like white ra^ and the juice thoroughly extracted ; season with very little 
salt, and stram through a wire strainer. Serve either warm or cold. To 
prevent jar toppling over, tie a string around the top part, and hang over a 
stick laid across the top of pot. When done, set kettle off stove and let cool 
before removing the jar, and in this way prevent breakage. Or, when beef- 
tea is wanted for immediate use, place in a common pint bowl (yellow ware), 
add very little water, cover with saucer, and place in a moderate oven ; if in 
danger of burning add a little more water. To make beef-tea more palatable 
for some patients, freeze it. 

CoRN-MEAL Gruel. — Add to three pints boiling water two table-spoons corn- 
meal, stirred up with a little cold water; add a pinch of saltand cook twenty 
minutes. For very sick persons, let it settle, pour off the top, and ^ive with- 
out other seasoning. For convjilescents, toast a piece of bread nicely, and 
put in the gruel with one or two table-spoons sweet cream, a little sugar and 
ginger, or nutmeg and cinnamon. When a laxative diet is allowed this is very 
nourishing. Or, take a pint of meal, pour over it a quart or more of cold 
water, stir up, let settle a moment,^ and i>our off tlie water; repeat this three 
times, then put the washed meal into three quarts of cold water, and place 
where it will boil; cook tliree hours, and when done add a pinch of salt. 
This is a very delicate way of cooking, and it may be eaten with or without 
other seasonmg. This is an old and very valuable recipe, used thirty years 
ago by Dr. Davenport, of Mi I ford Center, Ohio. 

Boiled Flour or Flour Ball. — Take one quart good flour; tie in a pud- 
ding-bag so tightly as to make a solid mass ; put into a pot of boiling water 
early in ihe mornmg, and let boil until bedtime; take out atid let dry. In 
the morning, peel oti' and throw away the thin rind of dough, and, with a 
nutmeg-grater, grate down the hard dry mass into a powder. Of this from 
one to three tea-spoonfuls may be used, by lirst rubbing it into a paste with 
a little milk, then adding it to about a pint of milk, and, finally, by bringing 
the whole to just the boiling-point. Give through a nursing-bottle. For 
children who. are costive use bran-meal or unbolted tiour instead of white 
flour, preparing as above directed. 

Rice Water. — Wash four table-spoons of rice ; put it into two <iuarts of 
water, wliicli boil down to one quart, and then add sugar and a little nut- 
meg. Tliis makes a pleasant drink. A pint or half a ])int of milk added to 
the rice water, before it is tAken from the fire, gives a nourishing food suita- 
ble for cases of dianhea. Sago, tapioca, barley, or cracked corn can be pre- 
pared in the same manner. 

Oraii'Oeadb. — This is an antiseptic and anti-diarrhea remedy ; try it Take 
of dilute sulphuric acid, concentrated infusion of oranee-peel, each, twelve 
drachms; of syrup of orange-peel, five fluid ounces; add two imperial gal- 
lons of water. Take a draught of a large wine-glassful. It is an excellent 
summer beverage for the South. 

Haw Beef for Children.— Take half a pound of juicy beef, free from any 
fat; mince it very finely; then rub it into a smooth pulp either in a mortar 
or with an ordinary potato-ma.sher, and press it through a fine sieve. Sjjread 
a little out upon a* plate and sprinkle over it some salt, or some sugar jf the 
child prefers it. Give it alone or spread upon a buttered slice of stale bread. 
It makes an excellent food for children with dysentery.

THE ARTS OF THE TOILET, 



Beauty and health constitute a royal inheritance. The child horn with 
such a heritage, and brought up by a mother who has the good sense to 
discard soothing syrups, narcptics and cordials, and carefully trains ap to 
cleanly habits, proper exercise, plenty of air and sunshine, and wholeaome 
food, starts in life with a capital that will in the long run tip the balance 
against the largest fortune in dollars. To keep health and beauty, or to 
restore it when lost, it is necessary to observe the laws of health, discarding 
quackery and panaceas of all kinds as superstitions, and inventions of 
the devil. Pure air and plenty of it, free sunshine and plenty of it, are 
better restoratives than all the jiatent medicines under the sun. Too often 
the doctor brings the medicine only to have the medicine bring the doctor 
again. The sunlight will give a lady's cheek a fresher tinge and a more 
delicate complexion tlian all the French powders and rouge in Paris. 

For thb Haib. — Wash in cold sage-tea. 

Camphor — put in drawers or trunks will keep away mice. 

The Nrck. — ^Too tight collars and neckerchiefe are apt to produce perma» 
nent swelling of the tnroat. 

Cocoa Butter. —Apply, at night, to face and hands, and wash off in thm 
morning. This is excellent for the skin, and keeps it soft and clear. 

To Clean Light Kids. — Put the glove on the nand, and rub thoroughly 
with white corn-meal, using a piece of cotton flannel. 

To KEEP Pearls Brilliant. — Keep in common, dry magnesia, instead of 
the cotton wool used in jewel cases, and they will never lose their brilliancy. 

Tonic for the Hair. — ^Ounce best castor-oil, two ounces each of French 
brandy and bay rum ; scent with rosemary and rose-geranium. 

To (Jure Chilblains.— Soak feet for fifteen minutes in warm water, put 
en a pair of rubbers, without stockings, and go to bed. 

Cement for Jet. — Use shellac to join, and then smoke the joints to mah« 
them black. 

Mother's Marks— should never be interfered with, except by the advic« 
of a physician. 

Tetter or Ringworm — of the face is caused by a disordered stomach, 
and must be cured by proper diet. 

Pimples— are caused by improper diet, and can never be cured except by 
correcting the habits. Cosmetics only injure. 

To Restore Color to Kid Shoes. — Mix a small quantity of good polish 
blacking with the white of an egg. 

Hair Oil. — Two tea-spoons each of castor oil, ammonia and glycerine; 
add alcohol enougli to cut the oil, and put in a four-ounce bottle half full of 
rain-water. Shake before using. 

Black Heads. — To remove ** blrfck heads " in the face, place over the black 
spot the hollow end of a watch-key, and press firmly. This forces the foreign 
substance out. so that It may be brushed off. and is a cure. 
(574) 



THE ARTS OF THE TOILET. 576 

To Keep off Mosquitoes. — Rub exposed parts with kerosene. The odor is 
not noticed after a few minutes, and children especially are much relieved 
by its use. 

The Breath. — ^Nothing makes one so disagreeable to others as a bad breath. 
It is caused by bad teeth, diseased stomach, or disease of the nostrils. 
Neatness and care of the health will prevent and cure it. 

The Skin .4nd Complexion. — Wasliing in cool, but not excessively cold, 
water, and general cleanliness, keeps the skin healthy and the complexion 
clear. 

Ivory Blacking for Shoes. — Four ounces ivory-black, three ounces 
coarsest sugar, one table-spoon sweet-oil, one pint small beer; mix well 
together. 

Castor-oil for Shoes. — Take a tea-spoon of it and rub in thorouglily 
by a fire. Do this when the shoes are new^ and several times afterwards, 
and they will last twice as long. 

Dandruff.— One ounce flour of sulphur to one quart of water. Shake 
well at intervals, for a few hours, and, when settled, saturate the head with 
the clear liquid every morning. 

For Chapped Hands, Face and Lips. — ^Ten drops carbolic acid in one 
ounce glycerine; apply freely at night Pure mutton tallow is also ex- 
cellent. 

Cologne Water. — ^Thirty drops each oil of lavender, cOl of beigamot, oil 
of lemon, and orange-flower water, half pint deodorizea aloohoL Cork and 
shake well. 

Corpulency. — An excess of fat is a disease. To reduce the excess, eat 
little or no butter, fat meat, gravies, sugar, vegetables, or oUier articles 
containing large amounts of starch or sugar. 

Dandruff in the Hair. — There is no simpler nor better remedy for this 
vexatious appearance (caused by a dryness of the skin) than a wash of cam- 
phor and borax — an ounce of each put into a pint and a half of cold water, 
and afterwards rub a little pure oil into the scalp. 

Moth Patches — may be removed from the face bv the following remedy : 
Into a pint bottle of rum put a table-spoon of nourof sulphur. Apply 
this to the patches once a day, and they will disappear in two or three 
weeks. 

Boston Burnett Powder for the Face — Five cents worth of bay rum, 
five cents worth of magnesia snow-flake, five cents worth of bergamoi^ 
five cents worth of oil oi lemon ; mix in a pint bottle and fill up with 
rain-water. 

To Clean Jewelry.— Any gold jewelry that an immersion in water will 
not injure, can be beautifully cleaned by shaking it well in a bottle nearly 
full of warm soap-suds to which a little prepared chalk has been added, and 
afterwards rinsing it in clear, cold water, and wiping it on a towel. 

Moles.— To remove, moisten a stick of nitrate of silver, touch the moles, 
and they will turn black and sore, and soon they will dry up and fall 
off of themselves. If they do not entirely go, repeat. It is better, however, 
never to attempt their removal without consulting a physician. 

Warts. — Wash with water saturated with common washing soda, and let 
dry without wiping: repeat frequently until they disappear. Or pass a pin 
through the wart, and hold one end of it over the flame of a candle or lamp 
until jthe wart fires by the heat, and it ^^ill disappear. 

Stains on the Hands — from nitrate of silver, may be removed by a solu- 
tion of chloride of lime. Fruit st^iins are removed by washing the hands 
without soap, and holding them over the smoke of burning matches or sul- 
phur. 

To Remove Sunburn. — Scrape a cake of brown Windsor soap to a pow- 
der, add one ounce each of eau de Cologne and lemon-juice; mix well and 
form into c^kes. This removes tan, prevents hands from chopping, and 
makes the skin soft and white. 



576 THE ARTS OF THE TOILET. 

Cold Cream fob Chapped Lips. — One-half ounce !»perniaceti, twenty 
grains white wax. two ounces pure oil of sweet almonds, one ounce pure 
glycerine, six drops oil of rose; melt first three ingredients togetlier, and, 
when cooling, add the glycerine and oil of rose, stirring until cold. 

Bad Breath— Bad breath, from catarrh, foul stomach, or bad teeth, may 
be temporarily relieved by diluting a little hromo chlonilum with eight or ten 
parts of water, and using it as a gargle, and swallowing a few drops just 
Defore going out. A ])int of brouio chiomlum costs fifty cents, but a small vjal 
full will last a long time. 

Fri'it Stains — may be removed from the fingers in the following manner: 
Mix together half an ounce of cream tartar and half an ounce of powtiered 
salt of sorrel; apply a solution of this to the fingers, and the stains will dis- 
appear. Diluted sulphuric acid may be used, but care should be taken that 
none of it touches any fabric, as the acid will destroy it. 

Flesh Worms. — Black specks on the nose disfigure the face. Remove by 
washing thorouglily in temd water, rubbing with a towel, and applying with 
a soft fiannel a lotion maue of three ounces of cologne and half an ounce of 
liquor of potash. Or press out by putting the hollow end of a watch-key 
over it. 

Lips or Hands Ghapped by cold weather or wind, should be rubbed with 
glycerine generally when about to be exposed to the air, or rubbed with 
honey after washing. Never kiss the lips of persons not in health, as dis- 
ease is sometimes contracted in this way, as well as by the use of towels, 
cups or tumblers used by unhealthy persons. 

Bay Rum. — Ten cents worth of magnesia, two quarts each of soft water 
and alcohol, one ounce oil of bay. I)isi>olve magnesia in rain-water, tlien 
add other ingredients. Wrap filtering paper in form of a funnel, and filter 
carefully through into a bottle and cork tightly. When used, dilute with 
rain-water to whatever strength desired. 

Leanness — Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive organs 
to digest and assimilate the fat-producing elements of food. First restore 
digestion, take plenty of sleep, drink all the water the stomach will bear in 
the morning on rising, take moderate exercise in the open air, eat oat-meal, 
cracked wheat, Graham mush, baked sweet apples, roasted and broiled 
beef, cultivate jolly i)eople, and bathe daily. 

Superfluous Hairs — Are best left alone. Shaving only increases the 
strength of the hair, and all depilatories are dangerous and sometimes dis- 
figure the face. The only sure plan is to spread on a piece of leather equal 
parts of ^Ibanum and pitch plaster, lay it on the hair as smoothly as pos- 
sible, let it remain three or four minutes, then remove it with the hairs, 
root and branch. This is severe but effective. ' Kerosene will also remove 
them. If sore after using, rub on sweet-oil. 

The Pace. — To wash projKjrly, fill basin two-thirds full with fresh, soft 
water, dip face in the water and then the hands; soap the hands well and 
rub with a gentle friction over the face; dip the face in water the second 
time and rinse oflf thoroughly, wiping with a thick but soft towel. Pure 
Foajis do not irritate the skin. The l>est are castile, curd, glycerine and other 
THHitral soaps. Medicated or highly colored or perfumed soaps should never 
be used. 

Food. — A good complexion never goes with a bad diet. Strong coffee, hot 
bread and butter, heated grea.se, highly sj>iced soups, meats or game, hot 
drinks, alcoholic liquors, fat meats, are all damaging to its beauty. Strong 
tea, used daily, will after a time give the skin the color and appearance c« 
leather. Coffee affects the s^kin less but the nerves more, ana a healthy 
nervous system is neces.sary to beauty. Late suppers, over-eating at meals, 
eating between meals, the use of candies, sweetmeats, preserves, etc., pn> 
duce pimples and blotches. 

The Hands. — The use of gloves, especially kids, help to preserve the soft- 
ness of the hands. Cleanliness and sprinkling with orris-root counteracts 



THE ARTS OF THE TOILET. 577 

excessive perspiration. Warts are removed by steeping the hands in warm 
water for naif an hour, and then paring away the white and insensible sur- 
face. The nails should be cut frequently, always in oval shape. The nail- 
brush should be full and soft. It should be rubbed on a cake of soap and 
then used vigorously. Biting nails is a bad habit. To break it up, in chil- 
dren, dip the ends of the lingers in a solution of aloes. 

The Nose. — Excessive wiping, snufling, and blowing, especially in chil- 
dren, deforms the noae, and should be i)racticed only wlien necessary for 
cleanliness. A nose leaning to one side, caused by wiping in one direction, 
may be cured by using the handkerchief with the other Land, or by wear- 
ing occasionally an instrument surgeons employ for that imrposc. Lar^e, 
fleshy noses are reduced by wearing at night a contrivunc^e which com- 
presses the artery that supplies the nose. Red noses become so by exi)osure 
to heat or the sun, by alcoholic drinks, or by a debility of the blood-vessels 
of the skin. The latter cause is removed by gentle friction and cold bathing 
of the feet. 

The Bath — Not only promotes cleanliness, but is a tonic. The skin does 
one-third of the work or breatliin}2r, and if the myriad of pores are closed, 
the lungs are overburdened, or else the work is left unuone. The tonic 
effect is caused by the contraction of the surface blood-vessels, driving tha 
blood back to the larger blood-vessels and the heart, bringing on a reaction 
which 'rushes the blood back to the skin, causing a glow, freer respiration 
and more vigorous action of the whole muscular system. A sponge or 
hand bath are the simplest forms, and should be taken in a moderately 
warm room. As a rule, the more rapidly a bath is taken the better, and it 
should always be followed by friction with the hand or with a not too rough 
towel. 

The Ear. — ^The outer ear should be well cleansed and the passage wiped 
out daily with a rag on the end of the little linger, but notlnng should be 
inserted* further. The insertion of a pin, orany liard substance, frequently 
ruptures the ear. When cleansing is necessary on account of accumulation 
of wax by cold, or other cause, it should be done by syringing with warm 
water, having dropped in two or three drops of glycerine the night before 
to soften the substance to be removed. This often cures sudden deafness. 
Cotton-wool stuffed into the ear is injurious and is seldom necessary. In 
conversing with deaf persons, it is important to remember that clearness, 
distinctness, and a musical tone of voice is understood much more easily 
than a loud tone. 

Teeth. — Cracking nuts, biting thread, eating hot food, especially bread 
and pastry raised with soda, very cold drinks, alternate contact with cold 
and hot substances, highly sea.'^oned food, alcoholic liquors and tobacco, 
metal toothpicks, and want of cleanliness, are injurious to teeth. After 
eating, the mouth should be rinsed with lukewarm water, and such pieces 
of food as are not thus washed awny removed by a quill toothpick. Tooth- 
brushes should be elastic and moderately hard.* Those with hairs not too 
close together are best and most durable. A brush that is too hard may be 
permanently softened by dipping in hot water. Rub up and down as 
well as across the teeth. Teeth should be often examined oy a com i>e tent 
dentist. 

Collars that do not Fit. — Few gentlemen have philosophy enough to 
endure an ill-fitting collar with patience, but not many understand why Uiey 
do not fit The fact is, the laundress stretches them tlie wrong way. 'l>amp 
linen is very pliable, and a good pull will alter a fourteen-inch into a fift<?en- 
inch collar in the twinkling of an eye. She ought to stretch them crosswise, 
and not lengthwise. Then, in straitrli tuning out shirt-bosoms, she makes 
another mistake of the same sort. They also ought to be pulled crosswise in- 
stead of lengthwi.se, particularly in the neighborhood of the neck. A length- 
wise pull draws the front of the neckband somewhat directly under your 
chin, where it was never meant to go ; and, of course, that spoils the fit of 



578 THE ARTS OF THE TOILET. 

Jrour collar. With the front of the neckband an inch too high, and the col- 
ar an inch too long, you have a most undesirable combination. 

Cutting Teeth. — Tlie time the first teeth make their appearance varieai, 
but the following dates approximate the time: Central incisors from five to 
eight months after birth ; lateral incisors from seven to ten : first molars from 
twelve to sixteen ; cuspids, or eye-teeth, from fourteen to twenty ; second mo- 
lars from twenty to thirty-six. The first teeth should be protected from de- 
cay as far as possible by careful cleaning daily: if decay makes its appear- 
ance, the cavity should be promptly filled, and the tooth saved until dis- 
placed by the permanent teeth. About the sixth year, the first molars of 
the permanent teeth make their appearance. They are generally supposed to 
>)elong to the first or milk-teeth, and are frequently Tost for want of care. 
i little more attention eiven to the first teeth would save parents and chil- 
dren sleepless niglits ana suffering. 

The Eyes.— Damp, foggy weather, the reflection of the bright sunshine, 
intense cold, dusty windTfeadinK on cars in motion, reading by gas or lamp- 
light when the light falls directlv on the e^'es, sitting before a glowing fire, 
wearing of glasses when not needed, wearing veils, and all indulgences that 
weaken the nervous system, injure the eyes. The most pleasing light for 
w^ork is from a northern exposure. A shade that protects the eyes from tho 
light that falls on paper, book or work is an advantage. The liRht should 
not come from different points, but that from behind the worker is best. 
A very weak or very bri^t light should be equally avoided. Diseases of 
the eye are often the -result oi general weakness, and in such cases local 
treatment has little effect In fitting glasses to the eye great care should be 
taken to adjust the lens to the eye with accuracy. Crown glass is preferable 
to fiint, on account of its superior hardness, its entire want of color, and 
its non-decomposition of light. Scotch pebbles are unobjectionable except 
as to cost. 

Dress. — ^The first object of dress is protection of the body, second to en- 
hance and bring out its beauty. Dress which does not enhance the beauty 
of the wearer, or which attracts attention from the wearer to itself, is out 
of taste. To be in correct taste it must be " becoming," and in this sense 
dressing is an art worthy of the attention and «tudy of the most intellec- 
tual and accomplished woman. The beauty of dress, to a cultivated eye, 
does not lie in its money value, but in its perfection in detail and per* 
feet adaptation to the wearer and the occasion for which it is intenaed. 
Any simpleton in petticoats, who has plenty of money, can order her 
clothes from Worth, in the latest Paris styles, but some quiet woman, with 
brains and taste, in simpler costume, will be sure to outshine her in 
•'society." Low-necked dresses, dragging skirts, corsets and stays, p*d«» 
dings, heavy skirts which rest on the hips, heavy veils, high-heeled biooti 
.and every other unphy Biological abomination in dress, mars beauty and de^ 
stroys health. 

Freckles. — Grate horse-radish fine : let it stand a few hours in buttermilk, 
then strain and use the wash night and morning. Or, squeeze the juice of a 
lemon into half a goblet of water and use the same way. Most of the reme- 
dies for freckles are poisonous, and can not be used with safety. Freckles 
indicate a defective digestion, and consist in deposits of some carbonaceous 
or fatty matter beneath the skin. The diet should be of such a nature that 
bowels and kidneys will do their duty. Daily bathing, with much friction, 
should not be neglected, and the Turkish bath taken occasionally, if con- 
venient. The juice of a lemon, in which there is as much sugar dissolved as 
the juice will hold in solution, is an excellent remedy for freckles. This 
sliould be applied with a camel's-hair brush several times daily, until they 
disappear. It mu.st be understood that all acids are astringents in their 
nature, and their too freqtient use is as injurious as many apparently more deleterir 
<ms cosmetics; for, by too frequent and violent contraction of the pores, they 
become overworked, and finally refuse to respond to the action of any apph<* 



THE ARTS OF THE TOILET 57^ 

cation ; wrinkles resnit, and are generally ineradicable, except after a tedi- 
ooa dietetic and medical course of treatment. 

Tbeth. — Many, while attentive to their teeth, do more injury than good 
by two much officiousness, daily applying some dentifrice, or tooth-powder, 
often impure and injurious, and rubbing them so liard as not only to injure 
the enamel by excessive friction, but also to hurt tl^e gums even more than 
by a toothpick. Tooth-powders advertised in new8paj)ers are to be suspected, 
as some of them are not free froiu corrosive ingredients. Cliarcoal (which 
wkitens the teeth very nicely), pumice-stone, cuitle-fisli, and similar sub- 
stances, are unfit for use in tootli-powdcrs, as all are to a certain extent in- 
soluble in the mouth, and are forced between the margin of the gums, form- 
ing a nucleus for a deposit. Below will be found a few good formulas for 
dentifrices: Three and one-half pounds of creta prepnraia, one pound each of 

Sowdered borax, powdered orris-root and white sugar, and two ounces car- 
amom seeds; flavor with wintergrecn, rose or jasmine. If color is desired^ 
use one pound of rose-pink and as much less of o'eta preparata. Tooth- 
powders should be thoroughly triturated in a wedgewood mortar and finely 
Dotted. The following is a simple and cheap preparation, and is pretty good. 
Take of prepared chalk and fine old Windsor soap pulverized well in pro- 
portion of about six parts of the former to one of the latter. Soap is a very 
oeneficial ingredient of tooth-powder. 

The Hair. — Professor Erasmus Wilson, of London, who is authority on 
the subject, condemns the washing of hair; but advises that it should be 
kept clean by brtishing, this being a more effective stimulant than water. 
In cases of ordinary falling out of the hair, he prescribes the following: 
Liquid ammonia, almond oil, and chloroform, of each one part, diluted 
witli five Darts of alcohol or spirits of rosemary, which can be made fragrant 
by the addition of a drachm of the essential oil of lemons. The head should 
undergo a thorough friction with the hair-brush, after which the lotion may 
be applied. It may be diluted, if necessary, and can be applied daily or 
otherwise. 

For removing scurf, he advises a lotion of borax and glycerine, two 
drachms of each to ei^ht ounces of distilled water. This is cooling, and 
allays dryness of the skin. 

In cases of baldness, a lotion of the following can be iised with effect: 
Camphor, ammonia, chloroform and aconite, in equal parts, to be rubbed 
on the bare place daily, or twice a day. 

A barber recommends ladies to have their hair .shampooed once a month. 
This will bring out the natural luster, soften it, clear it of dust, and rob it 
of that musty smell which comes of having long hair wound up closely for 
any length of time. It will also remove that itching of the head which some 
ladies find so troublesome. 

For Complexion.— Blanch one-fourth pound best Jordan almonds, slip off 
the skin, mash in a mortar, and rub together with best white soap, for fifteen 
minutes, adding gradually one quart rose-water, or clean fresh rain-water 
may be used. When the mixture looks like milk, strain through fine mus- 
lin. Apply, after washing, with a soft rag. To whiten the skin, and remove 
freckles and tan, bathe three times a day in a preparation of three (juarts 
water, one quart alcohol, two ounces cologne, and one of borax, in propor- 
tion of two tea-spoons mixture to two table-spoons soft water. Bathing the 
face in pure buttermilk, clear whev. sour milK, new or sweet milk, is sooth- 
ing and healing after walking, riding, driving, rowing or sailing. Do not 
plunge the face into cold water, neither dash tlie water over the face when 
suffering from sunburn or exposure to wind or water; the sudden shock is 
not only injurious to the whole system, but has been known to permanently 
deface the complexion by a species of tanning which left a brown or yellow 
tinge impossible to efface. 

Queen Bess Ooniplerum Wash. — Put in a vial one drachm of benzoin guna 
in powder, one drachm nutmeg-oil, six drops of orange-blossom tea, or 



580 THE ARTS OF THE TOILET, 

• 

apple-blossoms put in lialf pint rain-water and boiled down to one tea- 
spoonful and strained, one pint of sherry wine. Bathe the face morning 
and night: will remove all Hesh-worms and freckles, and give a beautiful 
oomplexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum of henzoin in pint of 
whisKv; to use, put in water in wash-bowl till it is milky, allowing it to 
dry without wiping. This is j^erfcctly harmless. 

•tHE Hair. — (.'ombsof tortoise-sliell, bone, or rubber, with not very sharp 
teeth, should be used. Sharp teeth injure the scalp and produce dandruff 
Two brushes, one hard, to clean the hair and scalp, and the other ssoft, to 
smooth and polish, are best. Clean brushes by rubomg them with bran, or 
wash with one part ammonia and two of water. Combing or brushing should 
be done in the natural direction of the hair, and never against it. In the 
proper way it can not be brushed too much. To keep the scalp clean wash 
m tepid soft water with a little pure soap in it, rinse in pure water, dry ^-ith 
towels and then in the sun or by the fire. Oily hair may be washed once a 
week, light hair less often. Some occuj>ations require that it should be 
washed much oftener. All preparations tor the hair are more or less injuri- 
ous. Healthy hair has enough oil of its own, and the application of foreign 
oil destroys its vitality. Preparations containing alconol fade hair and 
make it brittle. The only time when oil is admissable is after washing. 
The best prei>aration is one part of glycerine to three of rose-water. Pow- 
ders made of starch, when used, must be washed out of the hair to prevent 
injurv. Those made of colored glass are very injurious, cutting ana otJier- 
wise damaging tlie hair. At ni^it, the hair should be loosened and left 
free. Night-caps are a relic of oarbarism. Hair dyes are very injurious, 
as they all contain more or less sugar of lead, nitrate of silver, and other 
ingredients, which affect the brain, produce paralysis, innammation of the 
eyes, and impairment of sight. Gray hairs are an indication that the hair- 

SVoducing organs are weakening, \\hen found they should be cut down to 
le healthy part, and the head should be exposed as much as possible, ex- 
cept in tlie middle of the day, to the sun and air. When hair falls out, it 
indicates a disease of the scalp. To cure, dip the head twice a day in cold 
water and rub with a brush until a glow is produced. In case the hair is too 
long to wet brush until a glow is produced, and then rub into the roots a 
wash made of three drachms of pare glycerine and four ounces of lime- 
water. 

Thk Fekt. — The largest pores of the body are located in the bottom of the 
feet. For this reason the feet should be frequently and thoroughly washed, 
and tlie stockings changed often. If great cleanliness is not observed, these 
great pores become absorbent, and the poisons given off are taken back into 
the system. The nails ought to be cut squarely. Blisters i\jay be prevented 
by rubbing the feet, after washing, with glycerine. Bunions are caused by 
wearing shoes too tight or too short. They are difficult to get rid of, but may 
be riUeviated by wearing easy-fitting shoes, i)oulticing and putting a rub}>er 
rin^ an)und the spot. C-orns, which are caused by a ei)n tinned pressure on 
tlie foot, may be prevented by wearing woolen stockings and shoes that fit 
well. They are known as hard and soft, but their difference is entirely 
owing to locality. If a com is situated between the toes, where it is kept moist 
by perspiration, it is of the soft variety; but, if located on the outside of the 
toe. where it could get no moisture, it would necessarily be hard. They are 
produced by pressure or friction, and are simply a protective growth thrown 
out for tliepurpose of preventing the tissues being injured. They are suffi- 
ciently painful at all times, but they are the most unbearable when an acca- 
mulation of pus takes place beneath them. The escape of this <lrop of pus 
is prevented oy the hardened and thickened cuticle, which must be jmulticed 
or soaked in warm water, and then removed by a sharp-pointed knife. The 
entire com can be taken out with a little care and patient work, without 
drawing a drop of blood. The api)lication of caustics should be avoided in 
the treatment of corns, especially in old people, as fatal gangrenous inflaiu- 



THE AMIS OF THE TOILET. 681 

ination may be the result Temporary relief from a painful sore com may 
readily be obtained by applying strong carbolic add. Take the cork out of 
a small bottle of carbolic, and apply it (the oork^ to the com. Relief wHl 
come at once, and you will be enabled to walk with comparative comfort till 
you can flud time to remove the com with the knife. Hard corns may be 
treated as follows : Take a thick piece of soft leather or felt^ cut a hole in the 
center. Upon going to bed at night, fill the hole in the center of the leather 
with a paste made of soda and soap : wash it off in the morning, and repeat 
the process for several nights, and the com will be removed. Half a cran- 
berry, or a piece of lemon, bound on a com will soon kill it 

SwrrcHES — ^That have lost freshness may be very much improved by dip- 
ping them into common ammonia without dilution. Half a pint is enou^ 
for the purpose. The life and color of the hair is revived as if it were just 
<'ut from the head. This dipping should be repeated once in three months 
to free the switch from dust, as well as to insure safety from parasitic formar 

tiOQS. 

Rowland's Macassab Oil — Is a wonderful stimulant to the growth of 
hair: Tie one-fourth ounce chippinp of alkanet root in a piece of coarse 
muslin, suspend it for a week in a jar containing eight ounces of sweet oil, 
taking care to cover from dirt. Then add sixty drops tincture cantharides, 
ten drops oil of rose, and sixty drops neroli and lemon. Let stand three 
weeks closely corked. 

Ox-MABBow PoMATUK. — ^Takc two ounces of yellow wax and twelve ounces 
of beef marrow. Melt all together, and when sufficiently cool perfume it 
with essential oil of almonds. 

Ebuftions Caused by Hsat. — Nothing is better than bathing irritated 
parts in a solution of one tea-spoonful of the common carbolic acid to a pint 
of rose-water. The acid, as usually sold in solution, is about one-half the 
strength of really pure acid, which is very hard to find. Care must be taken 
not to let the wasn get into the eyes, as it certainly will smart, though it 
may not be strong enough to do further harm. No more purifying, healing 
lotion is known to medi^ skill, and its work is speedy. 

Coabse and Stippled Skin. — Some faces which are neither pimpled nor 
freckled look like a pin-cushion from which the pins have been dnwn out 
The oil-glands, particularly on the nose and cheeks, are coarse and large. 
Wearing at night a mask of quilted cotton wet in cold water will soften and 
renew the skin, and will do more for it than the costly toilet masks and cos- 
nietiques. It requires patience, four to six weeks bein^ required sometimes; 
but it works a cure and repays patience. The new skin is as soft as an in- 
fant's. When oily, bathing in camphor is an aid, but camphor should never 
be used on ^pod complexions, as it parches them. 

Fob the Complexion. — ^If ladies will use any thing, the following are the 
best and most harmless: Blanch one-fourth pound best Jordan almonds, 
slip ofT the skin, mash in a mortar, and rub together with the best white 
soap for fifteen minutes, adding gradually one quart of rose-water ; or cleim, 
fresh rain-water may be used. When the mixture looks like milk, strain 
through fine muslin. Apply after washine with a soft rag^ To whiten the 
skin and remove freckles and tan, bathe three times a da^ in a preparation 
of three quarts of alcohol, two ounces cologne, and one of borax, in propor- 
tion of two tea-spoons mixture to two table-spoons soft water. 

Sallownsss. — A preparation which rids the svstem of the cause of sallow- 
ness, and which is of value in the sprint, is made as follows : Half an ounce 
each of spruce, hemlock and sarsaparilla bark, dandelion, burdock and yel- 
low dock, in one gallon of water; boil half an hour, strain while hot, and 
add ten arops of oil of spruce and sassafras ; mix. When cold, add half a 
pound brown sugar and half a cup yeast Let stand twelve hours in a jar 
covered tight, and bottle. Use freely as an iced drink. It is equal to the 
root beer which New Yorkers drink so generally during warm months. 



ACCIDENTS A2n> SUDDEN SICKNESa 



It is no longer considered a mark of the highest type of the feminine 
mind to faint away at the smallest fHght, and to sink into helplessness at 
the first appearance of danger. Indeed, self-possession in emergencies i» 
evidence of a clear brain, which, at the critical moment, asserts its supremacy' 
over physical weakness, and takes command of the demoralized forces ; be- 
sides, fright and confusion are a confession of ignorance as well as want of 
self-control. Those who know exactly what to do in emergencies rarely be- 
come panic-stricken. And it is particularly important for women, who are^ 
doubtless, constitutionally more timid than men, to fortify themselves against 
danger, by learning what to do in such accidents and emergencies as are 
likely to occur in the life of every one. It would prove a rare case, indeed, 
if such knowledge did not, at least once in a life-time, enable the possessor 
of it to save a valuable life, perhaps one infinitely dearer to her than her 
own. Of course, within the limits of such an article as is permissible here, 
only a few hints can be given, rather to suggest further investigation than to 
be a complete guide. 

A LtFB-PRESERVKR. — A felt or silk hat, held so as to keep the crown fuU 
of air, will sustain a person above water for a great length of time. 

Panics. — If in a public hall in a panic, keep your seat; even in case of 
fire the chance of life is greater if free from tne crowd. 

Stinos of Insects— Are relieved by tlie application of ammonia, or com- 
mon table salt, well rubbed in, or a slice of an onion, to the part 

RuNAWAYB. — In all runaways it is safer to remain in the vehicle, and to 
stop witii it. than to jump while the horse is running. The vehicle helps to 
break the sh<x;k of the final stop. 

PoisoNODs WocNDS. — Wounds by which poison has been carried into the 
system, require instant treatment. The wound must be burned out by a 
stick of lunar caustic, or by inserting a large, red-hot nail. 

Burns by Alkalies, such as lime, caustic potash, soda, ammonia, etc., are 
stopped in their progress by applying vinegar, lemon-juic«, or other dilute 
acid ; they must be then treated like other burns. 

Burns prom Acids, such as oil of vitriol and aqua fortis, may be checked 
by the free application of water or handfuls of moist earth. The first dilutes 
the acid, and the second contains alkali enough to neutralize the acid. 

Chokinc*. — A piece of food lodged in the throat may sometimes be pushed 
down with the finger, or removed with a liair-pin quickly straightened and 
hooked at the end, or by two or three vigorous blows on the back between 
ilie shoulders. 

Fracture.— Send at once for a physician, and simply make the patient as 
comfortable a.s ix)ssible. If he is to be conveyed to some distance, the frac- 
tured part should be siip[>orted in its natural position by handkerchiefs- 
loosely tied. Allow no more handling than is absolute!}' necessary. 

Chilblains — Are the result of a chilling of tlic part. To cure, keep 
(582) 



ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS. 583 

away from the fire, and at night, before going to bed, wash in cold water, op 
rub in snow, and apply the compound resin ointment, made by all druggists, 
with a little oil of turpentine added to it. 

Swallowing Pieces of Broken Glass, Pins, etc. — By no means take a 
pui^ative. Rather partake freely of suet pudding, or any solid farinaceous 
food, and it is possible that both may pass away together without injury 
being done. 

Bites op Serpents. — When bitten by a rattlesnake, or other poisonous 
serpent, pinch the .skin, and, if the wound can be reached, suck out all the 
blood (>ossible ; if the skin of the lips and mouth is sound, no harm will be 
done. Whisky or brandy should, iiowever, be administered freely, to in- 
toxication. 

Fainting. — Debility of the nervous sy.stcni favors fainting. The head 
should be kept low ; and if the patient faint:) in a chair, the simplest treat- 
ment is to grasp the back of it and depress it until the floor is reached, while 
another holds the knees so as to prevent slipping off the side. The patient 
will usually recover bv tlie time the head has reached the floor. 

Shock prom Cold ^ater. — Prostration from drinking or bathing in cold 
water wliile exhausted by heat or exercise should be treated as described for 
shock from other cau.ses. Cold water should be taken in small quantities 
when the body is heated and exhausted, and a cold bath is often fatal under 
such circumstances. 

Epileptic Fits.— In these there is nothing which a by-stander or friend 
can do, except to keep out of reach such articles as may injure the patient 
during the convulsive movements; to loosen the clothing about the neck and 
throat, and to assist to some place of .•safety when the semi-conscious state 
returns. Other convulsions are treated in the same manner. 

Lightning. — If the person shows no si^ns of life, strip and dash the body 
with cold water, dry and place in bed with bottles of hot water at the pit of 
the stomach and extremities, keeping up artificial respiration until the nat- 
ural breathing is restored ; a tca-si)oon of brandy in a table-spoon of water 
may be given every few minutes. Burns from lightning should be treated 
like burns from any other cause. 

Breaking Through Ice. — In assisting persons who have broken through 
ice, get a long pole, or stick, or board, to distribute the weight over a greater 
surface of ice. In attempting to pet out of water upon the ice, after hft/ing 
fallen in, the best way is to approach it sidewise, and roll out rather than 
to attempt to raise the body up by the arms alone, as the weight is more 
widely distrihuted. 

Hangin(4.— Death is from the same cause as in drowning. Cut down the 
bodv without allowing it to fall, place on face, press back tongue with finger 
to allow any accumulation to escape from the mouth, place on the back, and 
treat as directed for the drowned. If body is still warm after the removal 
of clothing, stand off six feet and dash several times with a bowl of cold 
water, the face, neck, and chest. 

BrRX I NG -Houses. — When a house is on fire, close all the doors and pre- 
vent currents of nir. If the fire could be entirely shut in, it would smother 
and die out. The check will give time to get help, or, at least, to remove 
furniture and inakoall lives secure. If up-stairs when the stairway below 
is on fire, tear clothing to maskc cords to let yourself down by. If a room is 
full of smoke and flame, crawl on the floor, as the lower air is the colder and 
more free from .smoke. 

Foreign Bodif.?* in the Ear. — Take the head of the child between the 
knees, face downward, and inject a stream of wjym water into the ear, hold- 
ing the nozzle of tlie .syringe outside, so as to allow the foreign body to come 
out with the water. Probing, with any substance whatever, is very dan- 
gerous, and may inflict permanent injury. When the above plan does not 
succeod, call asnrgeon. Kill insects that get into the ear by pouring ia 
aweet-oil or glycerine, which drowns and brings them to the surface. 



584 ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS. 

Foreign Body in Nostril. — Children often push foreign bodies up the 
nostril. To remove it, make the child draw a full breath, and then, closing 
the other nostril with the finger, and the mouth with the hand, expel the air 
from the lungs by a sharp blow on the back. If it can not be removed in 
this way, compress the nostril above it to prevent its going uj) an^^- further, 
and hook it out with the bent end of a wire or bodkin. If this fails, call a 
surgeon. 

Fkeezino. — Keep the frozen person, or part, away from the heat If the 
person is insensible, take him to a cold room, remove clothing, rub with snow 
or clothes wrung out of ice-water. The cold friction should be kept up for 
some time; and when the frozen parts show signs of life, the uatient should 
be carefully dried and put into a cold bed in a cold room, ana artificial res- 
piration used until the natural is restored; and then brandy, beef-tea. and 
ginger-tea administered. The patient must be brought by degrees into the 
warmer air. Parts frozen should be treated by the same rule. 

Bites of Dogs. — The only safe remedy in case of a bite from a dog sus- 
pected of madness, is to burn out the wound thoroughly witli a red-hot iron» 
or with lunar caustic, for fully eight i^econds, so as to destroy the entire sur> 
face of the wound. Do this as soon as ixjssible, for no time is to be lost. 
Of course it will be ex^>ected that the parts touched with the caustic will 
turn black. If, unfortiumtely, it should chance that any one is bitten by a 
dog that is said to be mad, it is wortli while to chain, the animal up, instead 
of shooting it instantly, for if it should turn out that it is not mad — ^and a 
false alarm is frequently raised — the relief to the minds of all concerned 
is indescribable. 

Foreign Bodies in the Eye. — The particle almost invariably lodges 
under the upper lid, adhering to it If that lid is grasped by the thumb 
and finger, drawn outward and then downward, and then released, the lashes 
of the lower lid act as brush, and sweep off the intruder. If, how^ever, it 
adheres to the eye-ball, it may be removed by rolling the upper lid over a 
knitting-needle, and holding it there in such a position as to expose the sur- 
face, when the particle can be removed by the corner of a handkerchief. 
Sometimes it may become imbedded in the membnine which covers the eye- 
ball, or eye-lid, and require the aid of a surgeon. Never use any of the eye- 
waters, lotions, or salvos, advertised as popular. A particle of lime in the 
eye is very dangerous, and vinegar diluted with water should be applied at 
once; even when done inmiediatcly the eye will be seriously inflamed. 

Shock or Collapse from lightning, sudden and severe injuries, bums 
extending over a large extent of surface, or powerful emotions, producea 
Bometliing analogous to fainting. IMiice the patient flat on the back, with 
the head raised not more than an inch, and give a tea-spoon of brandy in 
a table-spoon of water, every minute for six or eight minutes. If the 
temperature of the body has been raised, and the action of the heart is 
restored, enough has been given. Application of heat to the stomach and 
extremities is useful. The nausea and vomiting that sometimes accompany 
it may be allayed bjj" swallowing whole small chips of ice, split off by stand- 
ing a piece with grain upright and splitting off a thin edge with the point 
of a nin. Ammonia applied to the nostrils is often useful, and cologne on a 
handkerchief is sometimes of service. 

PuNCTrRED Wounds need a pad at the surface. to cause clotting of the blood 
in the wound, but are otherwise treated like cutij. If pain follows and in- 
flammation ensues, the pad must be removed to permit the results of the in- 
flammation to escape. Thorns or splinters, when run into the flesh, shoulil 
be removed by cutting in far enough to get hold of and draw them out. 
Slivers under the nail, when not reached from the end, should be removed 
by scraping the nail thin, and cutting through it to the foreign bo<ly. and so 
withdrawing it; the part should then be tied with a cloth wet with water, in 
which a few drops of laudanum have been mixed. A puncture, by a rusty 
nail or some such substance, of the finger, toe, hand, or foot, fre<]uentl9 



ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS. 585 

caases inflammation, and yet there is not room for the foreign matter left in 
the wound to escape througli the tough skin, and lock-jaw results ; in all such 
cajses the wound should be cut open to provide a way of escape for the blood, 
etc., and a piece of linen wet with laudanum inserted. Wounds from bruises 
and lacerations especially demand careful treatment, on the same general 
principles given above. 

Suffocation. — This often occurs from carbonic acid gas, or *'choke-damp»" 
on entering wells or old cellars; this gas being heavier than air, falls and 
rests at the bottom. Before entering such places, test by lowering a lighted 
candle; if the flame is extinguished it is unsafe to enter until the gas has 
been removed, by throwing down a bundle of lighted shavings or nlazin;» 
paper, suflScient to cause a strong upward current. When a person is over- 
come by this gas, he must be immediately rescued by another, who njusr he 
rapidly lowered and drawn out, as he must do all wliile holding his breatli ; 
a large sack is sometimes thrown over the i)erson who goes to the rescue. As 
soon as brought out, place tlie person on his back, bare the neck and throati 
loosen clothing and strip as quickly as |K)ssible ; if he has not fallen in the 
water, dash cold water freely over head, neck, and shoulders, standing off sev- 
eral feet and throwing it with force ; artificial respiration should be used mean- 
time, as in case of drowning, with as little cessation as possible. If the per- 
son has fallen into the water when overcome by the gas, place in a warm bed, 
and use the means of artiflcial respiration vigorously. 

Suflbcation from burning charcoal, from anthracite or bituminous coal, or 
from common burning gas, or the foul gases from drains and cess-pools, ia 
treated as if from carbonic acid gas. 

Accidents in General. — The first and most important thing, after send- 
ing for a surgeon, when an accident has occurred, is to keep off the crowd. 
No one. except one or two in charge, should be allowed nearer than ten feet; 
and the kinaest thing a by-stander can do is to insist on such a space, and 
to select such persons as are willing to go for whatever is needed by the sur- 
geon or physician, so that there may be no delay, if any thing is needed. If 
there has been a "shock" from a fall or blow, although there may be no 
fracture or external injury, the jwrson is "faint," and should be placed flat 
on the back, with the head, neck, and shoulders alighily raised; the liinbs 
should be straightened out, so that the heart may act as easily as possible; 
the cravat, collar, and clothing, if in the least tijjht, should be loosened. A. 
sup of cold water will bring reaction soon if the injury is slight; a tea-spoon 
of brandy, in a table-sj)oon of water, every two minutes, gentle friction to 
the extremities, a handkerchief wet with cologne-water held to the nostrils, 
a fan, if weather is hot, will all aid in restoring full consciousnes.s. If 
thought best to remove the patient to his residence, or to a more favorable 
place for treatment, place on a stretcher, settee, or shutter, slipping him on 
gently, taking care that the body is supported along its whole length; throw 
a handkerchief over the face to prevent the unpleasant sensation of the 




Burns and Scalds.— First put the fire out. If the clothing is on fire, 
throw the person on the ground and wrap in cari)et, rug, or your coat, if 
nothing else is at hand. B^in wrapping at the neck and shoulders, and 
keep the flames away from the neck and face, so as to i>revent breathing the 
hot air and consequent injury to the lungs. If prostration and shock or 
fainting is produced, a little brandy, repeated often until there is a revival 
of strength, should be given. A sui)erncial burn covering a large surface is 
often more dangerous than a deejier one confined to less surface. If there is 
any cause for apprehension that the hot air has been inhaled, send for a 
physician at once. If the burn is slight in character, apply the water-dress- 
ing, by placing two or more thicknesses of old linen (from table-cloth or 
sheet), slightly dan4)ened over a surface a little larger than the wound; 

37' 



586 ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS. 

fasten on by slips of sticking-plaster, or tie on with bandages, and keep it 
wet by frequent applications of water. When the pain has moderated, a 
dressing of pure hog's-lard is one of the best. It may be purified, when 
doubtful, boiling in water until the salt and impurities have settled, and 
then set away to cool until the floating lard hardens ; this is gathered, placed 
in a bowl, set in hot water, and kept hot until all the water in the lard has 
passed off, when it is ready for use. The common soda used for cooking 
purpKJses may be employed as a dressing. A thick layer should be spread 
over the part and covered with a light wet bandage, keeping it moist and 
renewing it when necessary. A good dressing for a slight burn or scald is 
the white of an egg, applied with a soft rag or brush, applying fresh as the 

; a lather of soap from a shaving-cup of 



lirst layer dries ; a lather of soap from a shaving-cup often allays pain, and 
keeps out the air. If so serious that a physician has been sent for, it is better 
not to apply any thing, as it may interfere w^ith his examination and treat- 
ment of the case. In cases too severe for the mild treatment given above, 
send at once for a physician. 

Drowning. — Death is caused by cutting off the supply of fresh air from 
the lungs, so that the process of purification of the arterial blood ceasea 
Life is rarely restored after an immersion of five or six minutes, but recovery 
has been recorded after twenty minutes. Efforts to restore should be con- 
tinued for at least two hours, or until the arrival of a physician. What is 
done must be done quickly. The body should be recovered without loss of 
time, from the water, and laid face downward for a moment, while the tongue 
is pressed back by the finger to allow the escape of water or any other sub- 
stance from the mouth or throat (no water can ever by any possibility get 
into the lungs). This may be done while the body is being conveyed to the 
nearest house ; on arrival, strip off clothing, place on a warm bed,*with head 
raised very little, if any, apply friction with the dry hands to the extremities, 
and heated flannels to the rest of the body. Now breathing must be artifi- 
cially restored. "Silvester's ready method" is most favored by physicians, 
and consists in pulling the tongue well forward, to favor the passage of air 
to the lungs, and then drawing the arms away from the sides of the body, 
and upward, so that they meet over the head, and then bringing them down 
"until the elbows almost meet over the "pit of the stomach." These move- 
ments must be made, and persisted in, at the rate of sixteen to the minute. 
Another metliod is to place the body flat on the face, press gently on the 
back, turn body on its side or a little beyond, and then, turning bark upon 
face, apply gentle pressure again, repeating at the rate of sixteen times a 
minute. As soon as vitality oegins to return, a few drops of brandv, in a 
little water, may be administered, and, in a few minutes, some bee/-tea or 
light nourishment. Persons at all weakened by debility, especially by any 
thing that affects the nervous system, or those recovering from sickness, or 
in the least indisposed, should never venture into water beyond their depth, 
as such conditions predispose to '* cramp," against which the best swimmers 
are helpless. 

Sunstroke. — ^This is favored by intemperance, and by debility brought on 
by work in a heated atmosphere. Those who sleep in badly ventilated 
apartments are most subject to\t. Most cases are preceded by pain in the 
head, wandering thought and loss of mental cgntrol, disturbetl vision, irri- 
tability, sense of pain, and weight at pit of stomach, and labored breathing. 
The skin is hot and dry, or covered with profuse perspiration; the face 
bluish ; the breath rapid and short; and the action of the heart ** fluttering." 
In manj' instances the patient does not move an eyelid, from the beginning 
of the main attack until death ensues. 

Carry the person attacked at once to a cool, airy spot, in the shadow of a 
wall, or to a large room with a bare floor, remove clothing gently, place 
i^atient on the back, raise head two inches by a folded garment, dash entire 
body with water profusely, supplying basin with cold water from two buck- 
ets, one of which is tilled with water and finely i)ulverized ice while the other 



ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS. 587 

Is supplying the water used by the attendant. Dash on water with force, par- 
ticularly on head and chest. Two persons may also rub the entire body, par- 
ticularly the head, with a towel in which is wrapped pulverized ice. As soon 
as a decline in heat is noticed remove |>ationt to a dry place, and wipe dry. If 
heat comes on again when consciousness is restored, renew cold applications 
As soon as the heat declines, artificial resj^ration must be resortea to, until 
the natural takes its place. There being real asphyxia, as in drowning, no 
medicine is of use, and alcoholic stimulants should be carefully avoided. To 
prevent sunstroke, u.se no malt or alcoholic liquors, avoid overwork and ex- 
haustion, take plenty of sleep in a well-ventilated room, bathe every night, 
avoid drinking large quantities of water, esitecially at meals, wear loose- 
fitting garments, protect the head with a covering that will shelter from the 
sun and yet permit free circulation of air over the scalp; a ^raw hat of loose 
texture, with a lining that may be wet when going out, and a broad brim to 
protect neck ani shoulders, is best. 

Hemjrrhagek. — Bleeding from the nose may be stopped by lying flat on 
the back, with the head raised, and the hands held above it. The nose must 
be covered with a cloth filled with pounded ice, or wrung out of ice-water. 
The head should never be held over a basin, as the position encourages bleed- 
ing. The hlyyd may be received m a wet sponge. 

When any one coughs or spits up blood, the first thought is that it must be 
from the lungs. A slight knowledge of the characteristics of the blood fromi 
dific^rent parts that luuy come through the mouth will sometimes save much 
needless anxiety. 

Bl»d fr)m the lungs is always bright reil in color, because it has ju<st been 
pur:£ed by contact with the air. It is frothy, mixed with mucus, in small 
quantity, and is usually coughed up. 

Blooa from the stomticli is dark red, almost black, is mixed with particles 
of food, comes in large quantities, and is vomited. 

Blood from the mouth and gums is of a red color and usually mixed with 
saliva. Unless it has first been swallowed, it is not vomited or coughed up. 

In hemorrhage from the lungs the head and shoulders must be raised. 
Some physicians recommend a table-spoonful of table salt to be given in a 
tumbler of water. It is always safe to give cracked ice. 

Bleeding from the stomach may be checked bv the application of a mustard 
plaster over the stomach ; cracked ice should be given and the doctor sent 
for. 

In bleeding from wounds or recent amputation there are three things that 
jnav be dcme : 

I^irst, press the finger or the hand ovc r the bloeding point. 

Seccma, press on tlie main artery supplying the wound, or, if this can not 
be found, apply a bandage as tightly as j)ossible above the wcund. An 
excellent tourniquet may be improvised by knotting a handkerchief loosely 
around the limb, thrusting a short stick through it and twisting it tight 

The blood from an artery is bright red and comes in spurts with each beat 
of the heart, while that from the veins is a dark purplish color and flows in 
a steady .stream. When the bleeding is from an artery, the pressure should 
be applied between the wound and the heart; when from a vein, the limb 
must oe compressed beyond the wound. 

Third, raise the part above the rest of the body, that the blood may drain 
out of it, and support it on pillows. It should be bathed in ice-water. and 
have ice wrapped in cotton cloths laid on it. 

If faintness ensues, the sufferer should not be immediately roused, as this 
is nature's reme<ly, and acts by lessening the force and activity of the circula- 
tion. If any part of the body has been cut off, it should be cleaned of for- 
eign matter,' and at once replaced, wrapped in cotton to retain warmth, and 
a gentle pressure kept on it to retain it in place. Circulation is often restored 
and the union made complete.

ANTIDOTES TO POISONS. 



The first thing to do is to cause their rejection b^ vomiting, to do 'whicH 

fAace mustard mixed with salt on the tongue, or give large Quantities of 
okewarm water, or tickle the throat with a feather. These Taihng, instantly 
resort to active emetics, like tartar emetic, sulphate of copper, or sulphjite 
of zinc. After vomiting has taken place with these, continue it if poasibla 
by copious draughts of warm water till the poison is entirely removed. Of 
course, if vomiting can not be induced, the stomach pump must be em* 
ployed, especially if arsenic or narcotics have been taken. A brief tabla^ 
formulated as follows, may be useful for emergencies:

To Kill Earth-worms. — Ten drops of carbolic acid In & pint of water, 
poured over earth in flower-pots will kill all earth-worms. 

Sure Shot for Kosb Slugs. — Make a tea of tobacco-stems and a soap-suds 
of whale-oil or carbolic soap, mix, and apply to the bush with a sprinkler, 
turning the bush so as to wet the under as well as the upper part of the 
leaves; apply before the sun is up three or four times. 

Ivies. — A successful cultivator of ivies feeds them with iron and cod-liver 
oil ; the iron in form of rusty nails, mixed into the earth. Another pro- 
duced a luxurious growth by watering once a week with tobacco-water; 
making a tea of refuse tobacco-leaves and stems, or of coarse tobacco. The 
water from the washing of fresh beef is also of great benefit to ivies. Moisten 
the leaves with a sponge wet in tea, or put t«a-leaves around the plant. 

To Keep Plants Without a Fire at Night. — Have made of wood or ziiu*. 
a tray about four inches deep, with a handle on either end, water-tight — 
paint it outside and in, put in each comer a post as high as the tallest of 
your plants, and it is reaay for use. Arrange your flower-i>ot8 in it, and fill 
between them with sawdust; this absorbs the moisture falling from the 

Slants when you water them, and retains the warmth acquired during the 
ay, keeping the temperature of the roots even. When you retire at night 
spread over the post^s a blanket or shawl, and there is no danger of freezing. 
The tray may be placed on a stand or table and easily moved about. 

Window Gardening. — All the varieties of Englisli ivy, the hoyacamosa, 
the passion flower, the jasmine, tlie pilogyne suavis, and begonias are espe- 
cially suitable for window culture. Very pretty effects may be produced at 
the cost of a few cents, by planting verbenas, morning-glories, cobea scan- 
dens, and the maurandi&s in baskets or flower-pots, which may be' concealed 
behind statuary- or bronzes. The best fertilizer for them or any other house 
plants is that afforded bv the tea-pot ; the cold tea-grounds usually thrown 
away, if poured as a lioation to these household fairies, will produce a 
miracle oi beauty and perfume. 

To Prepare Autumn Leaves and Ferns. — Immediately after gathering, 
take a moderately warm iron, smear it well witli white wax, rub over each 
surface of the leaf once, apply more wax for each leaf; this process causes 
leaves to roll about as when hanging on the tree. If pressed more they be- 
come brittle and remain perfectly flat. Maple and oak are among the most 
desirable, and may be gathered any time after the severe frosts; but the 
sumac and ivy must be secured as soon after the first slight frost, as they be- 
come tinted, or the leaflets will fall from the st«m. Ferns may be selected 
any time during the season. A large book must be used in gathering tliem, 
as they will be spoiled for pressing if carried in the hand. A weight should 
be placed on them until they are perfectly dry ; then, excepting the most 
delicate ones, it -will be well to press them Hke the leaves, as they are liable 
to curl when placed in a warm atmosphere; these will form beautiful com- 
binations with the sumac and ivy. 

Keeping Cut-Flo wers Fresh. — Cut-flowers soon drop and fade. Here are 
some of the ways in which they are preserved: Ada to the water a few 
drops of camphor or ammonia, a little salt, a lump of charcoal ; immersing 
the stems in hot water when a boucjuet is first maae, and then as they com- 
mence to wilt repeating it. first cutting off the ends. Have a skillet or pan ob

the stove with boiling water, in depth from half an inch to an inch, hold the 
stems in the boiling water for a few seconds, make into bouquets and place 
in water; or if you wish to send to a distance, pack in a box, and send by 
mail, or anv way you wish. When placed in the water a little salt or a 
rusty nail dropped in helps to keep them fresh. In making bouquets, be 
careful not to crowd too many flowers into one vase. They will last longer, 
to say nothing about their improved appearance, if the^ stand loosely. 
Never use cold water. Let it be lukewarm, and soft if possible. Sprinkling 
flowers in vases at night will help to keep them fresh, and, better still, lay 
them out on the grass where they will receive the dew, being careful to take 
them in early in the morning in summer, before the hot rays of the sun 
have wilted tliem. 

Flat }x)uquets, made in plates or glass platters, can be built up with a 
foundation of sand. Flowers will last much longer if their stems are thruat 
into wet sand than they will in water. The sand can be covered with nios8» 
the flowers can be arran^d in any fanciful shape that suits, and they will 
not be likely to become disarranged, for the sand holds them in place firmly. 
Instead of moss, leaves can be used to cover the surface and make a ground* 
work for the design, or bits of geranium branches, which often put out roott 
in the damp sand, and most of them grow right alon^ as if nothing had hap- 

Sened to them. Very pretty designs may be made of tin about an inch m 
epth in diamond crosses, and letters, and then filled with sand and flowers. 
In making button-hole bouquets, or arranging flowers such as roses, camels 
lias, etc., for the hair, cut the stems off at right angles and immediately 
apply hot wax to the end of the stock, then wrap in tin-foil, or to keep 
them, after applying the wax : place each one in a paper cone or cap so that 
the leaves do not touch the paper. The cap shoula be sealed up with glue 
to prevent air, dust or moisture from entering. When the glue is dry it 
should be placed in a cool place. W^hen wanted, cut off" the waxed end and 
place in water, where it will bloom in a few hours. 

House Plants. — Plants that require a high or low temperature, or a very 
moist atmosphere, and plants that bloom only in summer are undesirable. 
Procure fresh sandy loam, with an equal mixture of well rotted turf, leaf 
mold and cow-yard manure, with a small quantitj' of soot. In repotting use 
one size larger than they were grown in; hard burned or glazed pots prevent 
the circulation of air. Secure drainage by broken crockery and pebbies laid 
in the bottom of the pot. An abundance of light is imjiortAnt, and when 
this can not be given, it is useless to attempt the culture of flowering plants. 
If possible they should have the morning sun, as one hour of sunshine then 
is worth two in the afternoon. Fresh air is also essential, but cold, chilling 
draughts should be avoided. Water front one to three times a week with 
soft luke-warm water, draining off all not absorbed by the earth. Do not 
permit water to stand in the saucers, as the only plant thriving under such 
treatment are calla lilies, and even for these it is not necessary unless while 
blooming. Dust is a great obstacle to the growth of plants ; a good sliower- 
ini; will generally remove it, but all the smooth-leaved plants, such as 
camellias, ivies, etc., should be occasionally sponged to keep the foliage clean 
and healthy. Plants succeed best in an even temperature ranging from six- 
ty to seventy degrees during the day, with from ten to twelve degrees lower 
at night, ff troubled with insects put them under a box or oarrel and 
smoke from thirty to sixty minutes with tobacco leaves. For the red spider, 
the best remedy is to lay the plants on the side and sprinkle well or shower. 
Repeat if nece^ary. The soil should be frequently stirred to prevent caking. 
If manures are used give in a li(}uid form. Some of the most suitable plants 
for parlor culture are pelargoniums, geraniums, fuchsias, palms, begonias, 
monthly roses, camellias, azaleas, oranges, lemons. Chinese and English 
primroses, abutilons, narcisus, heliotrope, stevias, bouvardias, petunias^ and 
the gorgeous flowering plant poinsettia pulcherritna. Camellias and azaleas 
require a cooler temperature than most plants, and the poinsettia a higher 



FLORAL, . 591 

temperature. Do not sprinkle the foliage of the camellias while the flower* 
bnds are swelling, as it will eause them to droop, nor sprinkle them in the 
sunshine. They should have a temperature of about forty dejjrees and 
more shade. By following these rules, healthy flowering plants will be the 
result. — J. S. Robijisoji. 

Thk Care of House Plants.— When plants are frosted sprinkle with 
fresh cold water, and place under a box or something that will exclude the 
light and prevent too great a change in temperature. Keep them thus for 
two days. After sprinkling, be careful to put them where they will not 
chill again. Horse-manure, two years old, is best for carnations. For bego- 
nias good drainage is indispensable. The whole family thrive in a compost 
of one-half loam and one-half leaf-mold with a slight portion of sand. From 
September to February give pelargoniums only enough water to keep them 
from wilting; then water freely, and when they begin to bud, apply a little 
liquid-manure, or add ammonia to the water twice a week. Double gerani- 
nms should be kept in small pots, as they will not bloom well until the roots 
become compact. They require a higher temperature than the single varie- 
ties. During warm weather, the foliage of fuchsias should be well sprinkled 
every evening to prevent its becoming seared too early. To obtain plants of 
the greatest beauty in form and color, plenty of light and space is essential. Do 
not allow the foliage of one plant to overshadow another. — Mrs. Prof. F. Wood. 

Hints about Plants. — Few things are necessary for the successful culti- 
vation of house plants. A i)atient, untiring spirit is most important. The 
other requisites are plenty of sunlight, fresh air, and water when they need 
it It is better to give a good supply of water when called for by drooping 
leaves, than to give a little at a time often. Never leave pots to set in water 
in saucers except for the calla lily. To repot, turn plants upside down on 
the left hand, rap pots sharply with stick ; this will loosen it from the ball 
of earth ; lift it off, and place the plant in a pot two sizes larger, or in the 
ground. Do not leave the soil too rich with manure but well mixed, and 
composed of sod-soil, wild or leaf-mold, and well-rotted stable manure. Cut 

giants back pretty closely when vou cliange tliem, and they will thrive bet- 
jr afterwards. Water well at first, then only moisten slightly until thejjr 
begin to grow. A good rule for watering plants is once a week in winter if 
the weather is mild, or when it has moderated, have a gallon watering-can 
filled with blood-warm water, stir in a tea-spoonful of aqua ammonia, and 
as you set the plants in a convenient place (I set mine on the kitchen floor), 
pour in pot a plentiful supply of this warm water, and after this, sprinkle 
well with warm water without ammonia. In summer two or three times a 
week is the rule. Ivies need large pots, and should be repotted every year 
in the summer time. 

A good way to start slips is to partly break off the slip, but do not entirely 
0ever it from the parent stock, leaving it hanging for ten or twelve days; 
then remove, and plant in a box of half sand or brick-dust and half leaf- 
mold, and it will oe well rooted in a week. Do not water too freely, or 
the slip will rot This is better for both slip and plant, as the slip will get 
XMurishment from plant while healing over, and its removal will not weak- 
en the plant so much. Hyacinths are very attractive flowers for window- 
gardening, and at the same time require verv little care or trouble. Get 
the bulbs in the fall before frost from any good florist ( Vick is my favorite), 
and keep in a cool place until December, then plant each one in a four- 
inch pot with soil one-fourth sand, one-fourth well-rotted manure, one-fourth 
garden or sod-soil, and one-fourth broken bits of moss and leaf-mold; 
water thoroughly at first, and set in dark closet until the flrst of Janu- 
ary, then bring to light and ^ve plenty of water. A very good way is to 
set half a dozen or more pots m a large dripping-pan, pour hot (not boiling) 
water in pan, and let sat for one hour. After they are done blooming, let 
them dry out gradually. They will not bloom the second season as well 
as the first —JfTJS. G. 



THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD. 



A MAN may eat his fill and yet be liungry. It i? not the' quantity but the 
proper quality in food that satisfies. It is not only true that what is one 
man's food is another's poison ; but it is also true that what is food at one 
season of the year, at one period of life, or in one climate, may be poison 
to the same individual at another season or age. or in another climate. The 
inhabitant of the tropic subsists and thrives on fruits on which the Ice- 
lander would starve ; while the blubber and oil that makes up the diet of 
the inhabitant of the frozen zones would be fatal to those who live under 
the burning sun of the equator. Even the same ]>erson requires a fmit 
diet in the tropics, and one of fats in the north region. The child requires 
food made up of different elements from that which best suits the adult; 
and the diet of a laborer in the open air must differ from that of the brain- 
worker, who takes little exercise, and wiiose work makes heavy draughts 
on the nervous system. 

No one has luastered the art of cooking who does not know something 
of the chemical elements of foods, and the purpose they serve when taken 
into the system. It is particularly important that those who are compelled 
to practice rigid economy should know just what foods w^ill best supply 
the real needs of the family, and how the most real nourishment may be 
had for their money. 

An adult takes into the system daily, through lungs and mouth, eight and 
a quarter pounds of dry food, water, and air necessary for respiration. The 
same amount is given off as waste througli the pores, lungs, kidneys, and 
intestines. Life and activity consume this amount &s fuel just as a lamp con* 
Bumes oil. Every movement, every breath, every heart-beat, every thought 
burns up a certain amount of fuel-material, and if the supply is not forth- 
coming, the machinery stops and death ensues. The better the oil the more 
perfect the light ; and the more perfectly the food is adapted to its wanta^ 
the more vigorous the body, and the more perfect the working of its intri- 
cate machinery of muscle, nerve, and brain. 

Food is first masticated and then digested. In mastication it is not only 
moistened with saliva, but acted upon chemically in preparation for the 
more vigorous and thorough work or the stomach. It is a mistake to sup- 
pose that water or any of the various drinks taken at table are a substitute 
for saliva. They not only do not prepare food for the stomach, but force 
it into the stoniach unprepared, and, oesides, retard digestion by delaying 
tlie process until the water can be absorbed into the blood. For these rea- 
sons drinks should precede or follow a meal. Crusts of. bread and hard and 
firm food is wholesome, principally because it must be tlioroughly masti- 
cated before it can be swallowed. 

When the food reaches the stomach it rouses into action, the gastric juice 
pours from hundreds of little points, the food is diluted and the more solv- 
ent parts dissolved, to be taken up by the thousands of little mouths which 
honeycomb the surface, and earned into the circulation to repair the waste 
of tissues. The oily jwrtions of food, and such as do not yiela to the action 
of the gastric juice, pass on and are subjected to the influence of the bile 
and pancreatic Huid, until all that is of value is absorbed, while the waste 
is rejected and passes off. 
(S92) 



THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD, 593 

This mach of the digestive process needs to be known to make clear the 
Why of certain processes in cookery. As the juices of the stomach only act 
on the mrface of the food which passes into it, it is easy to see why light 
bread is more wholesome than heavy. The gastric and other juices can act 
only on the outside surface of a heavy lump of dough; but when made 
into light and porous bread, the outer surface is not only vastly increased, 
but the juices pour through thousands of avenues, and penetrate and act 
on every part. If the frugal housewife knew this, would she set the heavy, 
soggy loaf of bread before her children '*to save it?" Many a mother ig- 
norantly gives her child a stone when it asks for bread. 
• Fats of all kinds do not digest in tlie stomach. The gastric juice mingles 
with but does not dis.solve them. It is only after they have passed on and 
become subjected to the action of the bile and pancreatic fluid that they 
are taken up and made available as carbon for lung combustion. Fats, un- 
combined with other substances, act as emetics or cathartics and not as food. 
It is only when combined with other food that they are capable of being 
taken up by the absorbing vessels, and made to act as fuel to the system. 
A half pound of crude lard, unmixed with an^ other substance, would be 
rejected, but when thoroughly and skillfully mixed into a flakey crust will 
not derange the stomach, and will be assimilated and utilized. Remember 
that the use of more fat than can be perfectly blenrledy or any carelessness or imper* 
fection in the process, is sure to produce indigestion and work mischief. 

Foods difTer in the time required for digestion. Some fruits refresh in- 
stantly, the juices being at once absorbed into the circulation. Some meats 
and vegetables yield almost immediately to the action of the gastric juice, 
and pass into the circulation. Others require a long time for digestion. 
The more subtle and delicate flavors and parts of food yield first ; then the 
«luten of the flour, the curd of the milk, the fiber of the flesh, reinforce 
the blood and supply muscular waste, while, later, the oily and sugary por- 
tions are worked over to repair waste or furnish fuel to keep up the heat 
of the body. 

Food has chiefly two offices to perform : the repair of muscular waste, 
and the supply of the body with fuel to keep its heat up to 98**. Each of 
these is inaispensable to health and strength. The chief part of what ww 
eat is used by the lungs for fuel ; the rest, excepting small portions of min- 
eral substances, such as lime, potash, sulphur, etc., goes to the production 
of muscular and brain force. The great secret in the preparation of food 
that will prolong life and maintain a high state of health, is to adapt it to 
the peculiar conditions of those to be fed, — ^age, occupation, climate, and sea- 
son to be considered. Variety of food is nearly always at hand ; knowledge 
only is necessiiry to choose tliat best adapted to present needs. 

The heat of the body is produced by the action of the lungs, which uses 
op the heat-producing food, as action of muscle or brain consumes the mus- 
cle-making material. The former is non-nitrogenous; the latter nitrogen- 
ous. Foods may be divided into three groups: the nitrogenous, in which 
nitrogen is the chief element, and which feed muscle oi)ly; the non-nitro- 
genous, chiefly carbon, which produce heat only ; and those in which both 
are united. 

It has been proved by chemical analysis that the body requires four to 
five ounces for heat to one for muscle, and this gives us the key to the 
proper proportion of the elements in food, varying slightly, of course, with 
seasons, climates, occupation, and conditions. 

The substance richest in nitrogen, the muscle-making element, is alba- 
men, found in its most perfect form in the white of an egg. The lean or 
Ted parts of beef, mutton, venis<m^ and chicken contain nearly as great a 
percentage^about fifteen per cent. The curd of milk, also, contains a largo 
percentage, as well as gram, pease, and beans. If muscles only were to be 
fed, these would be nearly perfect foods, but for one ounce that goes to 
tnuiscle, five canoes must go to heat, and this calls for carbon. 



594 THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD, 

The carbon needed to keep up the bodily heat comes chiefly from starch, 
which is abundant in the vegetable kingdom. Grate a potato and wash in 
a succession of waters, allowing the sediment to deposit each time, and a 
floury substance will appear, perfectly white, and dry and crispy to the 
touch. This is starclt, and consists of round grains, too small to*^ be seen 
by the eye. One-half of the bulk of dry starch is cjirbon; the remainder 
is oxygen and hydrogen in exactly the proj>ortion as in water; and in that 
wonderful laboratory, the stomach, the carbon is eliminated from the starch, 
and the oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water. 

The starch made fmm wheat is .seldom used as food. Sago, Tapioca, and 
arrowroot, so much uijcd fur puddings, are almost pure starch, with slight 
coloring matter taken from the niaterial. Corn starch is less agreeable in 
flavor, and makes a less firm jelly when cooked. These dessert dishes are 
eaj«ily digested, and contribute carbon, but do not feed muscle, except as 
thev are combined with milk, eggs, etc., in cooking, which contain a littie 
nitrogen and a good deal of carbon. This food, then, is not adapted to a 
working man or to growing children, who need to have their muscles fed. 
For persons of sedentary habits, especially for the aged, whose feebler res- 
piration needs a large supply of carbon to keep up beat, they are valuable 
oecause easily digested. For others they are of value only to supplement 
muscle-making footl as a dessert. 

The following table (Prof. Yeomans) gives the proportion of starch in coni' 
mon grains: 



Per Cent Starch 
Rice Flour, . . . 84 to a5 
Indian Meal, . . . 77 to 80 



Per Cent Starch. 
Barley Flour, . . . 67 to 70 
^Rye Flour, . . 60 to 61 



Oat Meal, . . . . 70 to 80l Buckwheat, ... 52 

Wheat Flour, . . . 39 to 77 1 Pease and Beans, . . 42 to 43 

Potatoes (75 per cent water) 13 to 15. 

The large variation in wheat flour is due to processes of grinding. Va- 
rieties of wheat only vary about five per cent, but the old process of mak- 
ing fine white flour, used only the middle or starchy parts of the kernel, 
rejecting the gluten (nitrogenous and muscle-feeding). The whitest and 
highest-priced flour was, therefore, least nourishing, containing the largest 
per cent of starch. Modern invention has, however, reversed this, and the 
best "new process" flour contains the largest proportion of gluten. The 
old argument in favor of Graham, that it contained a larger proportion of 
nitrogen, and better supplied the body with muscle-making material, no 
longer holds good. Analysis shows that the best "new process" flour and 
Graham are almost identical in these elements. The only advantage left for 
Graham is the action of the coarser particles of bran (the outer shell and 
indigestible} on the coatings of the stomach, which is often salutary, but 
^metimes injurious to the delicate membranes. When flour and bread 
made from it contains one part nitrogen to four of carbon, it is nearly per- 
fect food, and will sustain li/e. 

The substance which is of next importance in supplying carbon to the 
body is oil (which is chiefly carbon). The oils used for food are butter, 
lard, and fat of beef. Other oils, used sometimes in cooking, are nearly iden- 
tical with these. Thev contain about eighty per cent of carbon, butter hav- 
ing the least. In grains, oil varies, being nine per cent in corn meal, six 
in oatmeal, three and a half in rye, and one to two in wl-.eat. Oils and 
starch serve the same purjjose in the digestive process; both are useful to 
supply carbon; neither nourish muscle. Starch is easy of digestion, requir- 
ing one hour, while butter is converted into chvme in three and one-half, 
mutton-fat in four and a half, and beef-fat in five and a half hours. This 
furnishes the best of reasons why fats should be sparingly used, especially 
in warm and moderate weather, when asuflicient supplv of carbon is easily 
Becured from vegetable foods. Besides, it is a well established fact that ex- 
cessive use of fats in cooking cause an excessive secretion of bile, ar4 this^ 



THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD. 595 

In tarn, canses a sensation like hnnser and an increase of saliva. This is 
mistaken for real hunger. More food is taken, and indigestion and, later, 
dyspepsia result. An eminent authority says : **I believe it will be foupd 
the offending ingredient in nine-tenths of the dishes that disturb weak stem* 
achs." Dyspeptics need to reject not only foods in which fats are mixed, 
but those in which they are a natural element, such as the yolk of eggs, 
liver, milk, rich cheese, etc. Yolks contain twenty-eight per cent of ml, 
and milk over three per cent. One condition only calls for the use of fats 
in daily diet: Long-continued exposure to excessive cold. One pound of 
fat furnishes as much carbon as two and four-tenths pounds of starch, or 
seven and seven-tenths pounds lean meat. When the moisture of the breatb 
is converted to ice and freezes on the beard, the air has no watery vapor 
and is nearly |)ure, containing a large per cent of oxygen. To meet this in 
the lungs requires abundant carbon, and oils furnish this most readily. 

The best bread for cold weather is that containing most oil. Corn bread 
ranks first, oatmeal next, rye third, and w^heat last. Of course compara- 
tively few are exposed to the rigors of winter in civilized life, and Ibrief 
exposure to cold is off-set by an increase of clothing, and ordinary diet fur- 
nishes a plentiful supply of carbon. For woodmen, soldiers, sailors, pilots, 
travelers, railroad men, and others exposed to long cold storms, especially 
when they can not exercise freely, should eat liberally of fat beef, yolks of 
<eggs, and butter. Butter is the least objectionable oi fats. Fat from salt 
pork and smoked bacon is less injurious than that from fresh pork. Beef fat 
IS also much more w^holesome than lard. Above all, let the cook remember 
that oils are physic, and next to poison, if not blended with substances which 
contain large quantities of starcn, such as rice, mealy potatoes, and bread 
made of fine wheat flour. An ounce of lard and a pound of flour thoroughly 
blended in a loaf of bread is digestible, but the same amount added to com 
meal (already rich in oil) would be fit food onl^ for a Greenlander. The 
proper proportion of oil in food in ordinary circumstances is illustrated 
in milk, which contains three and one-half parts oil in one hundred. 

The next important element which supplies carbon is sugar, which is con- 
tained in greater or less quantity in aU vegetable' substances, and largely 
(five to six and one-half per cent) in milk. Sugar contains forty per cent 
carbon, the rest water. It seems to be first converted into fat, and then 
used in respiration. In moderate quantities it has no injurious effects. A 
part of sugar as ordinarily eaten passes into lactic acid, and aids digestion, 
but if too much is produced digestion is retarded. 

There are two kinds of sugars in commerce, — cane and grape. The former 
is made from cane, maple sap, beets, corn-stalks, etc.; the other from plants 
which have an acid juice. Cane sugar contains twelve parts carbon to eleven 
of water; grape sugar twelve of carbon to fourteen of water. Sugars are 
changed by fermentation into carbonic acid and alcohol, but grape sugar is 
most liable to such fermentation, — cane sugar first becoming grape sugar by 
chemical combination with water. Pure cane sugar remains perfectly dry 
and unchanged in the air, while grape sugar attracts moisture, and becomes 
mealv and damp. Cane sugar dissolves more readily in water than grape, 
and hence tastes sweeter. Two jKJunds of cane sugar sweeten as much as 
five of grape. These facts give a hint to housekeepers of great value. Grape 
eugar, which is worth only two-fifths as much as cane, is used largely to 
adulterate the latter. The fine, floury "powdered" sugar is largely grape 
sugar, and is not only of much less value, but deteriorates more rapidly than 
pure cane sugar. Brown sugar, after standing for some time, absorbs water 
from the air, and becomes grape sugar. It is, therefore, the best economy 
to buy the best white granulated sugar. 

There is another element of food wliich does not feed muscle, vegetable 
jelly called pectine. This and pectine acid particularly abounds in fruits 
and bernes. By the processes of ri5>enmg. tht\ vegetable'acids which aro en- 
closed in little c^lls, Xur^t ont, are diffused through the mass of fruit| and 



596 THE OHEMISTBY OF FOOD. 

manufacture pectine or jelly. Heat produces the same effect as ripening^ 
and cooking is, in fact, only a rapid process of ripening. This jelly, when 
combined with sugar, goes to make up a variety ot delicate articles, such as 
jellies and marmalades. They are nourishing, principally, on account of the 
sugar they contain, but are easily digested, cooling, and uelicious. It should 
be mentioned that nearly all fruits are rich in sugar, — a ripe peach contain- 
ing as much as an equal quantity of cane juice. 

There are some other suhstances which a]ipear in less quantity in foods 
which seem none the less essential to huulth and life. One of these is phos- 
phorus, which is an element of brain and nerves, and is wasted by mental 
activity and nervous excitement. The brain-worker demands a diet rich in 
phosphorus, and in such a form us to be easily assimilated. The food that 
best sustains a laborer in the open air is not the best for those who live 
among the excitements and exhausting demands on the brain, that are the 
rule in city life. For the latter, eggs, most kinds of fish, oysters, lobsters, 
crabs, game, cheese, niul, among vegetables the potato; and these foods are 
just what are craved l»y city people. 

Another element is sulphur, which is required in the growth of bone and 
cartilage, the hair and nails. Of this there is so much in the yolk of an egg^ 
that silver is blackened by contact with it. Curd of milk and cheese are also 
rich in sulphur. 

Iron is alwavs present in healthy bipod, and its absence — paleness — is an 
indication of illness. Most articles of food contain iron ; in the juice of flesh, 
in eggs, and in milk it is abundant. Lime and salt arealso ingredients in all 
foooTthe fornier making bone, and the latter playing an important part in 
the creation of the digestive juices. Linui is found in all grains, particularly 
in wheat and in milk, in form of subphosphates. Bread and milk are for this 
reason an excellent diet for growing children, as they supply not only heat 
and nmscle, but lime that goes to supply the growth of bone. Salt also ex- 
ists in many articles of food. 

Men and races grow in proportion to their skill in combining heat and 
muscle-producing foods. The hardy Scotch use oatmeal largely, which is 
rich in nitrogen. The Irish, who endure a large amount of hard labor on 
chea^ fare, eat potatoes, oatmeal, cabbage, and milk, while the lime and 
phosphates are said to be derived from the " hard" water impregnated with 
lime. The English add bacon (heat-producing) to beans, rich in nitrogen, 
and to rice, which abounds in starch (carbon), add milk and eggs, which feed 
muscle. The Italian eats macaroni, which is principally starch, with cheese, 
rich in nitrogen. The use of chemistry in cooking is to t«ach how to wpple- 
ment one kind of food by another which contains the essential elements 
which the first lacks. For Instance, venison contains fifteen per cent nitro- 
gen to fifty-two carbon, or as one to three and a half, while the ratio should 
be one to four or five. To make it perfect and satisfying food, we have 
only to supplement it with something rich in carbon, as wheat bread, oat- 
meal, potatoes, or rice. A farmer's dinner of salt pork and boiled cabbage 
is nearly perfect for an out-of-door laborer in cold weather. The cabbage is 
rich in nitrogen and the pork in carbon. It is a proper dinner dish, because 
it requires four and a half hours to digest, while a supper may be made on 
Tenison, which is digested in an hour. Beef has fifteen per cent of nitrogen, 
but is not so easily digested as venison, and is fit only for a breakfast or din- 
ner dish. Wheat bread does not contain nitrogen enough for a working- 
man's diet, and butter eaten with it does not supply the lack. Some kind of 
Jean meat is needed to make perfect food. The more active the life out of 
doors the nearer can health be sustained on a diet of lean meat only. Beans 
contain, next to meats, the most nitrogen, and are excellent food for laborers. 
The cabbage ranks next, and afterward come oats, wheat, and barley. The 
potato contains seventy-five per cent, water. An analysis of the dry mat- 
ter shows one- tenth of it to be uitrc^en, so that its nutritive value is nearly 
equal to wheat, while its great productiveness recommends it particulaTl^ 



THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD. 597 

to denseljMDOpulated coantries. A dozen large potatoes are equal to a pound 
of flour. Tne onion is very rich in nitrogen, — one onion being equal to three 
potatoes of ec^ual size in nutritive value. 

Milk contains all the important elements of foo<l; yet adults need solid 
food. Add to milk eggs, rich in nitrogen, rice and sugar, rich in carbon, and 
you have a nutritiousdish, easily digested. 

Butter-milk is a wholesome drink, particularly in summer, as the nutritive 
power of the milk is but little reduced by the removal of the butter, while 
the sourness, due to the formation of lactic acid, aids digestion. 

Eggs contain a great deal of carbon, and are, for that reason, good food for 
cold weather. They are too concentrated for exclusive diet, and should be 
eaten with coarse food, or tliat which is composed largely of starch. 

In making cakes, the oil of the yolks of eggs used makes the perfect bleni - 
ing of lard or butter imi>ossible, and hence unwholesome. For this reason 
aponge cake, which contains no butter, is' less objectionable. 

Breads differ but little in these elements. Corn meal contains more oil 
and less nitrogen than others, and oatmeal is richest in nitrogen. The 
easy blending of the elements, and the tough gluten of wheat, make it tlie 
most available grain for bread. Wheat bread alone will support life longer 
than any other food except animal flesh. The proportion of nitrogen to car- 
bon is one to five, which is nearly correct for a sedentary person. For active, 
out-door life more nitrogen is needed, and is best supplied by lean meats. 

The nutritive qualities of animals differ but little. Wild meats digest 
more easily than tame, though the time re<juired varies with the age and 
condition of the animal. Flesh is a stimulating diet because it is force-giv- 
ing and muscle-feeding. The animal has gathered from various sources and 
concentrated in its flesh the constituents which best meet the wants of our 
bodies in the most available form. 

Applying the knowledge of the wants of the body, and of the elements 
of food to a bill of fare, and a wholesome breakfast aemands strength-giving 
and muscle-making food. Nothing is more quickly available than oee^teak, 
and it is most digestible broiled. It is a diet for real workers. Eggs are 
nutritive, but less stimulating. These provide for the muscles. For heat, 
starchy food is demanded, but bulk is not desirable for breakfast after a long 
fast. Bread and cakes of wheat flour are best for the purpose, and fruits, 
raw or cooked, furnish the mild vegetable acid, which aios digestion. If cof- 
fee is taken at all, breakfast is the time, so that the stimulating effect may 
pass away before the hour of rest comes. An infusion of genuine coffee, not 
a decoction, is not injurious in the morning to most persons, and is beneficial 
to those exposed to changes of temperature. 

Nothing appeases the appetite sooner than the juice of flesh. The barley 
gives a color and flavor. Following soup is roast beef, which feeds the 
muscles, and after it come the puddings, which abound in carbon, to give 
the fuel necessary to keep up the animal heat. Last comes fruit to aid 
digestion, with its agreeable acids. In summer less carbon should appear 
on the bills of fare, and blanc manges, creams, fruit puddings and piej, 
berries, and ripe fruits should make up the desserts. 

In making a feast, the wise hostess would consider well what has been 
the employment of the guests. A party of fox-hunters, or wood-choppers, 
or surveyors, would require an abundance of meats, but a collection of art- 
ists and scholars would relLsh better a variety of delicacies and novelties. A 
sleighing party will devour carbon, but those who have sweltered under a 
July sun long for cooline fruits and the leanest of meats. The time when 
a feast is given should decide whether food, easy or difficult of digestion, 
should appear on a bill of fare, though such consideration for the health 
of gueste 13 hardly to be expected of the average hostess. 



DRESS MAEING AT HOME. 



There are many women who spend but a small sum yearly on dresa. but 
only a few on that little contrive to dress neatly, and closely enough to the 
prevailing fashion to make a ladylike appearance. Some are so mistaken as 
not to care how they look. This is a serious mistake, for a well-dressed 
person not only commands respect and consideration from others, but, from 
the consciousness of being becomingly dressed, feels better, has better com- 
mand of all her faculties, and makes a much better appearance in any circle. 
It is worth while for a man even to take special note of his dress when he 
has any important business on hand, and a thousand times more so for 
women whose success depends in a larger degree on an attractive exterior. 
In a man, genius may cause slovenly garments and habits to be overlooked, 
but no genius can make a slovenly or even carelessly attired woman attract 
ive or successful. There is, among people of small means, too much neglect 
of personal appearance. The happiest people are those who make the best 
of adverse circumstances, instead of magnifying trouble and brooding over 
small miseries until they become mountains of tribulation. Because one 
can not afford the richest fabrics is no reason for dressing shabbily, or even 
out of taste. Taste costs no money, only a little study, a little exercise of 
the brain. 

It is a great mistake to suppose that economy in dress means shabbiness; 
the one is commendable, the other odious. It is unpleasant to see elegant 
dresses worn after they have reached a point beyond neatness, but it is posi- 
tively disgusting to see dresses which were poor in the beginning continued 
in service after they have become ragged and dirty. Ra^ed is a hard word 
to use in connection with ladies' apparel, but it is unfortunately true, that 
with some the dresses worn in home-life are far from neat and whole. 
Worn sleeves, torn breadtlis, and a frin^ of ragged braid upon the bottom 
ought to condemn a dre&s. But when it readies thaf state, some women 
think it is in just the condition to wear when there is no risk of its been seen 
by any other than the members of the family. Wise matrons, it is said, 
advise their sons to select rainy evenings for calling upon their young lady 
frien<lj3, so that they may find out who are fit to be seen when not expecting 
visits. The visitors who find a charmer who is, on state occasions, beautifully 
clothed, wearing a slouchy, dirty wrapper, with trimmings half torn off ana 
ninned up in places, no collar or rufne, but a tumbled lace handkerchief 
knotted around the throat, and hair still in the torture of crimping-pins, and 
slipshod boots, with missing buttons, may be excused if they make a short 
call and never repeat it. Many a slatternly girl has lost a lover by allowing 
careless habits to fasten upon her. The time spent in keeping garments in 
perfect order, and thus preventing shabbines& is well bestowed, for besides 
the comfortable self-respect conferred upon toe wearer, the clothes reward 
the effort by lasting twice as long. 

Gratifying good taste in dress does not necessarily involve a great expend! 
ture of monev, for good effects depends less upon costliness of materials than 
iJSM) 



DRESS MAKING AT HOME. 599 

cm the graceful and becoming designs into which they are wrought and the 
pleasing way in which colors are combined. 

Women sliould make a study of the art of dress. Instead of extravagance 
it would promote economy. If each would study her individual style she 
would make few mistakes in buying, and find less temptation in the passing 
novelties and Heeting fashions that constantly ensnare shoppers with whom 
dress is a matter of experiment rather than a science. MistaKes in dress con- 
sume a great deal of money, and purchases made without careful study are 
seldom satisfactory, and are sooner thrown aside than an article of dress 
which graiities the sense of Htness in both wearer and beholder. 

Fitness is the foundation of correct taste, and dress should always be in 
harmony with its surroundings and with the age and condition of the wearer. 
A velvet dress with rich lace trimmings might be elegant and becoming upon 
a wealthy young lady at a reception, but a dre&s of the same kind would look 
strangely out or place at a country sewing society, worn by a young lady 
whose ordinary dresses were of calico. Its inconsistency at such a time ana 
upon such a person, would be striking enough to hinder its exciting ad- 
miration. 

Poverty has no more galling sting than the fancied necessity for keeping 
mp appearances ; in other words, for sailing under false colors, and present- 
ing an appearance which imitates that of richer acquaintances. It is pitiful 
to see women, whase good sense in other matters is unquestionable, wearing 
out brain and muscle in the agonizing struggle to give themselves and their 
families a look of ease and style that comes naturall}^ to their richer neigh- 
bors. It takes not a little courage to say, "I can not afford it;'* but it Is 
Bobler and truer to .•jay ii than to hide behind subterfuges, or more cowardly 
still, to incur unwarrantable expense rather than confess to poverty. 

*' Put the best foot foremost.^' but never do it at the cost of self-respect. 
One who is poor should not degenerate into carelessness and shiftless ways; 
for if ever thrift and good management is needed, it is where money is 
scarce. There are some people who can make a dollar go twice as far as 
others, and this faculty, though natural to many, is as often an accjuirement 
as a gift. It is the result of care, though tfulness, and an unceasing watch- 
fulness, which is irksome enough until it is looked at in its right light and 
Bet down as a duty. Economy is not parsimony, although it has fallen into 
disrepute by being falsely so called. That there is no disgrace in savins 
and no merit in wastefulness is a fact that should never be forgotten, ana 
wise mothers who wi.sh to fit their daugliters for any sphere shouUl care- 
fully inculcate that idea. In older countries economy is a most commend- 
able virtue. It is only here, where large fortunes are won with such magical 
rapidity, that a few weak-minded people pretend to despise it 

There is a bald economy which shows its pitiful bareness in every point 
•f dress, and there is an econoaiy which struggles to conceal its devices and 
makeshifts by making everything appear to the be.vt advantage. No one 
can dispute the fact that of the two the latter is far the most graceful and 
praiseworthy. It costs more thought and effort to make garments stylis^h 
and pretty, but the well-dressed woman has her reward in increased self- 
respect. One woman will make over a hard worn dress into a dreary gored 
wrapjier unrelieved by trimming. Another will convert the same material 
Into a jaunty skirt and basque, and from the apjMirently unusable portions 
decorate them in some tasteful way. Ortainly the lady who wears the latter 
costume will be better plejused with herself, aiid grace the family table more 
satisfactorily to her friends than the other. 

There are |^oi)Ie who pretend to be too good to care for dress, and despise 
others for being fond of what they please to call frivolity. A close analysis 
of the character of such people would often bring to li^ht far graver faults 
and weaknesses than a love for dress, which, kept within proper bounds, is 
not reprehensible, but rather commendable. 

It can hardly be repeated too often that quiet dressing should be the role 



600 DRESS MAKING AT HOME. 

for those who are unable to procure a variety of clothes. The wearer of a 
ahowy dress is so soon recognized by it, and she, as well as her frienda, 
ffpows sick of it long .before ita term of usefulness is over. A plain black or 
dark dress can be made stylishly and will be as dressy as a figured one, and 
will not be remembered from time to time, even if it is worn on every occasion 
for a long while. Briglir ribbons and fresh rutfles and laces will change and 
beautify the plain quiet dress, and ^ive one a reputation for becoming and 
tastefuf toilettes without its occurring to any one that the same old dress 
forms the basis of all the prettv changes. It is in making over an old dress 
that fancy material can be u.*jed to g<KMi advantage to freshen and piece out, 
but in buying and making a new dress, when iho event is a rare one, it is 
infinitely wiser to buy it of a solid color and make it in an inconspicuous 
manner, not forgetting to get a sufficiently ample pattern to allow of a large 
piece to lay a.side for future alterations and improvements. 

Even a very poor lady may dress with taste, and a working-girl may show 
more of it in her simple dress than an extravagant and weiUthy lady will in 
hers. In fact the ability to buy finery of all sort«, and gratify a strong fancy 
for decoration often leads to bizarre effects, which destroy the beauty of ei^. 

Sensive costumes. One need hardly be afraid of offending good taste by 
ressing too plainly, provided the plainness is the perfection of neatness. 
That, indeed, should belong to all styles of dress; for nothing so entirely 
takes away one's reputaticm for being well-dressed, as torn, soiled or shabby 
apparel or trimmings Not only that, but other unfavorable deductions aa 
to character and habits are apt to be drawn of those whose habitual appear- 
ance is other than neat. 

People who are not rich can not afford to be carele.ss, because clothes that 
are not taken care of will not last as long as those which are kept in order. 
A small outlay of money and a liberal expenditure of time and patience will 
keep even a meager wardrobe in good order, and will forestall the outlay 
of considerable sums, Et(»rnal vigilance is the price of decency for jKwr 
folks. Garments often wear out faster when not being worn than when they 
are in use. Dresses crowded into a closet, and allowed to hang for days 
under the weight of a cloak or two or three other dresses, will not pa.ss the 
ordeal without injury. Lingerie carelessly tossed into a drawer, where there 
is a confused assortment of other articles, will not come 9Ut in good order 
for wearing again ; and tojn flounces, mended with pins, do not add to the 
durability of a dress any more than does putting it away with an accumula- 
tion of street dust on the bottom. 

I iHandsome dresses that are not often worn should be folded with extreme 
care, with every ruffle and plaiting in place. This plan is supposed to pre- 
vent the sagging of the drapery that is sometimes given oy constant hanging. 
Another way to prevent this is to hang it upside down occasionally by tapes 
pinned upoii the bottom of the skirt; this reverses all the customary folds, 
and freshens the general appearance. Of course every bit of dust should have 
been previously wiped off, and for this purpose nothing is better than an old 
silk handerchief. The dress should be pinned up in towels or pices of old 
muslin, and laid away upon a shelf, or in a drawer, if an emptv one suffi- 
ciently large is available. The importance of keeping dresses in shape when 
they are oft the person is so well understood in France that many ladies who 
do not Iiave maids of their own hire a profes.sional expert to fold away their 
more elegant dresses. When, unfortunately, the closets of a house are not 
roomy enough to contain good dresses without folding too much, large paste- 
board boxes may be ordered from any box maker or book bindery, which 
will soon save their cost by preventing injury to costly garments. As a rule, 
put away every article of apparel as soon as it is taken off. Dresses must be 
shaken and brushed, and if they have been worn in the street, thoroughly 
cleaned upon the bottom, then they should be hung up by loops sewed on 
the back of each armhole, and if possible allowed the full possession of the 
hook or nail, as hanging under or against other garments is no advantage to 



DRESS MAKING AT HOME, 601 

% dress. Shawls should be carefully folded in the original creases and pinned 
ap in a square of clean linen before laying away in a drawer. Cloaks must 
be brushed, and either laid in a long drawer or trunk and subjected to no 
pressure from other gannents, or hung up by a loop on the back of the neck ; 
or better still, cut a piece of wood something in the shape of a wooden yoke, 
such as is sometimeH used across men's shoulders to suspend milk pails to, 
and fasten it up by a string tied in the middle and hang the cloak upon that. 
It will keep the back and shoulders in good shape. It is a good plan, in a 
lar^ closet that is often opened, to have a calico curtain to protect that part 
of It devoted to cloth and woolen goods, as by contact witn dust they soon 
grow grajr and dingy. 

Throwing a dre«s carelessly upon a chair with other clothes taken off at 
night, because it is only a common one is a very bad habit. Ordinary dreisses 
are worthy of care, and pay for it by presenting a better appearance to the 
end. They should be brushed, shaken, turned wrong side out, and hung up 
in a closetwhich has a door to shut out dust, and above all they should be 
kept in good repair. Every rip and rent should receive attention as soon as 
it occurs, or a condition of shaobiness will ensue that will be a great obstacle 
to making the dress over when the time comes. 

A clothes brush, a wisp broom, a bottle of ammonia, a sponge, a hand 
brush, a cake of erasive soap, and a vial of alcohol should form a jmrt of the 
furnishings of every toilet. After all dust has been removed from clothing, 
spots may be taken out of black cloth with the hand brush, dipped in a mix- 
ture of equal parts of ammonia, alcohol and water. This will brighten as 
well as cleanse. Benzine is useful in removing grease spots. Spots of grease 
may be removed from colored silks by putting on them raw starch made 
into a paste with water. Dust is best removed from silk by a soft flannel, 
from velvet with a brush made specially for the purpose, or a piece of crape. 
Shawls and all articles that may be u)lded, shoula be folded when taken 
from the person in their original creases and laid away. Cloaks should be 
hung up in place, gloves pulled out lengthwise, wrapped in tissue paper and 
laid away, laces smoothed out nicely and ff)ldcd, ir recjuisite, so that they 
will come out of the box new and fresh when needed again. A strip of old 
black broadcloth four or five inches wide, rolled un tightly and sewed to 
keep the roll in place, is bettor than a sponge or a cloth in cleansing black 
and dark colored clothes. Whatever lint comes from it in rubbing is black 
and does not show. When black cloths are wajflied, as they may often be 
previous to making over, fresh clean water should be used, and they should 
De pressed on the wrong side before being quite dry. If wa.shed in water 
previously used for white clothing they will be covered with lint. In secur- 
ing clothing against moths, if linen is used for wrappings no moth will 
molest. Paper bags are equally good if they are perfectly tight, and so are 
trunks and boxes closed so tightly that no crevice is loft open for the en- 
trance of the moth fly. As the moth loves darkness, it will not molest even 
furs hung up in light rooms open to air and sunshine. 

Bonnets and hats also merit tender care, and should not be allowed to 
lie about and gather dust; but, after being taken from the head, should be 
dusted, the bows and trimmings straightened, and laid away in boxes. If 
the feathers seem limp and slightly uncurled, sometimes holding them over 
the hot air of an open register will restore them. Veils, neck-ribbons, and 
cravats will also keep fresh much longer if carefully folded up and laid 
away under a weight sufficient to keep them in place. Soiled ribbons, in 
most colors, can be restored by washing in alcohol and water, and, instead 
of being ironed, smoothed by being stretched tightly upon a board, held in 
place by pins, and wiped gently with a soft handkerchief once or twice in 
the drying. 

Shoes even pay for good care. On taking them off do not leave them in 
the shape of tne foot, out smoofh them bv stretching out the wrinkles and 
bending the soles straight. If buttons are lacking, iew them on immediately, 

38 



602 DEESS MAKING AT HOME. 

and if other repairs are needed, have them attended to at once. Jfever wear 
a shoe with a single button uti*, a.s it destroys the shape. On old shoes the 
fit is greatly improved by setting over the buttons as far as comfortable for 
the foot If the heels become worn down on one side, straighten them with- 
out delay, or the shoe will take a {>ermanent twist. 

Gloves with many are greatly abused, which is a mistake, because to be 
well gloved contributes very much toward a lady like appearance, and unless 
one can afford a constant procession of new gloves it is desirable to keep the 
old ones in order. When taken off they should not be rolled together in a 
lump, as is tlie custom with many, but pulled and stretolied lengthwise, and 
laid away in a box, like new gloves, without any folding. They shouhl also 
be kept repaired, for if rips on the linger ends are neglected they soon get so 
large that in mending theiu it is impossible to restore the proper shape of 
the lingers. Kid gloves should be turned and the tears mended upon the 
wrong side; they can be sewed more neatly than U|X)n the other side. "When 
gloves are of poor kid, or where there is a weak portion which parts 
easily, it is well, instead of darning them, to work in an elastic lace stitch, 
with silk of the same color. This is done by making a succession of button- 
hole stitches, catching one to the other till the rent is filled up. When soiled 
they can be cleaned at home as well as at a professional cleaners. Wash 
them in benzine, using (juite a quantity, as it is cheap when bought by the 
quart or half gallon, being very careful to keep a good distance from the 
nre or any lamp, as benzine is very infiammable and dangerous. The com- 
mon benzine is best Perhaps the best plan is to let them soak for ten min- 
utes in the benzine, then scjueeze out tne gloves, wash them out in a fresh 
cupful until the dirt has made the liquid quite dark, then rinse in a clean 
cupful. This last may be put away in a clo.ve bottle to use for soaking the 
next pair that is to be cleaned. Now pull them straight and rub with a soft 
handkerchief until dry. Place over them thin, soft white paper and iron 
them hard with an iron not hot enough to draw them. This puts a polish 
on them and makes them look like new. If too large they mav be shrunk a 
little by using a hotter iron. Now place them in a towel and lay near the 
stove for two or three hours to remove all smell of benzine, and then place 
in the glove box with sachets of violet between them. 

It is an excellent plan, when one glove of a pair has unfortunately been 
lost, to preserve the odd one to mend with. It is not usual to patch gloves, 
but it often happens that% misfit can be remedied by inserting a V. shaped 
piece in the palm; for this and other contingencies a supply of odd gloves 
often proves valuable. 

One of the most important things is economy in the manner in which 
money is spent for wort. Many an overtiisked woman, feeling it impossible 
to accomplish all her sewing without assistance, will employ a dressmaker 
to make and make over dresses, and herself wrestle with the weary, never 
ending accumulation of plain family sewing and repairing which could be 
done by cheap help. This is not good management, for professional skill is 
always expensive to procure, and the price paid for making one dress would 
be enough to hire a large amount of plain sewing done. Gutting and fitting 
dresses is not difficult with good patterns at command, and there is no rea- 
son why any one should hesitate to undertake her own dressmaking. It is 
an art one soon actjuires and becomes very expert in after a little practice. 
Let a woman feel herself capable of making a dress faiily well, and what a 
vista of possibilities opens oefore her. Old garments that are not worth 
spending a penny upon can be put to goo<l use if the owner knows how to 
fashion them herself. It is commendable to work over old clothes, and 
make them look as new and stylish as taste and industry' can contrive. 
ITever be contented with a simply decent old dress; but, if you can not 
afford a new one, take the time to make the old one tasteful and as near 
the fashion as can be. Perhaps some one will say you are foolish to spend 
time and strength on old material, but judge for yourself if it is not .ludj-

DRESS MAKING AT HOME. 603 

clonsly roent when it brings as a result a costame which gives yon that com- 
fortable feeling of self-respect that a nretty and becomine dress does not fail 
to confer upon the wearer. Even tne most showy fashions of the present 
time favor remodeling and making over dresses. Two or three materials still 
enter into the composition of street and house dresses, and the greatest 
liberty of taste is allowed in the shape of overskirts and the modes of trim- 
ming. Basques, round waists, jackets and polonaises, all are seen upon new 
dresses. No one style seems to reign in any department of dress cutting, 
which is a great blessing to those who make their new dresses out of old 
ones. Another point which is of especial advantage to those who have 
real 'genius and skill in making over dresses is the fancy for individual 
novelties in costume. Ladies of fashion boast of having designed a dress 
which is unique and unlikely to meet its counterpart. Dressmakers rack 
their brains to invent styles which they can assure favorite patrons shall be 
repeated upon no other dress. 

If abandoned ganuents, for which there is no immediate use in any form, 
were always wholly, or partially taken apart and laid away carefully, instead 
of being tucked away at random, they would moke a better appearance 
when their opportunity for usefulness occurs. 

In these days of mixtures and combinations there are few thin^ which 
can not be made serviceable as trimmings or to assist in composing some 
of the costumes expert economists make up out of odds and ends. Every 
thing of the sort in a family should be savea with a view to usefulness in the 
future. There should be a receptacle in garret or store-room where large 
'and small pieces may quietly bide tlieir time out of every one's way. It Is 
quite a treat to visit such a rece{)tacle when the dressmaking time of each 
season draws near, and look over its resources. Many hidden and forgotten 
bundles will come to light, and be greeted as so much saving of money. 
Some old breadths may make a sham skirt to build a new dress upon, an- 
other fragment will perhaps make a facing or waist lining. A great deal of 
money is spent for such minor details of a dress, which might be saved and 
spent in a more showy manner, if strict attention were paid to treasuring up 
old passessions. Every thing of the kind should not only be saved but put 
awaj' in good order. If an old dress is abandoned, do not hang it up in its 
worn out condition, but rip it all to pieces, clean the breadths, for if they are 
worth using at all, they are worth cleaning, and4bld them neatly. Select all 
the best i)ortions of other parts of the dress and serve in the same way. It 
is very disheartening to find material in a dirty condition wlien the occa- 
sion comes to use it, and if it is needed in a hurry, the chances are that 
something new will have to be bought to take its place. The best parts 
of old cotton underclothes may be dyed with family dye, and u.sea for 
linings for dresses and children's clothes. For waist linings cotton cloth 
had better be left undyed. White linings are not in the least objection- 
able where corset covers are worn; on the contrary, they are Uie choice 
of many dressmakers. 

In altering over old black silk dresses do not use a hot iron on them ; 
sponge tlie pieces with a large sponge dipped in clear coffee, and then fold 
and lay away under a pressure as heavy as possible. The silk will come out 
looking almost like new. 

An independent i)olonaise, for wearing with different skirts, is not an arti- 
cle of dress much advised now bv dressmakers, because a certain uniformity 
is considered desirable in dress, t>ut economical people can not afford to give 
up the useful garment which creates such a pleasing variety in a slender 
wardrobe. A black cashmere polonaise, for instance, or even a gray flannel 
one, can be worn over several skirts, and thus supply street and house cos- 
tumes at little cost. 

Black is handsome, lady-like and irreproachable ; and she who is not the 
fortunate possessor of one good black dress is really worthy of pity. The 
black dresses of to-day are frequently gay with colored trimmings, and the 



604 DRESS MAKING AT HOME. 

Persian cashraeres and brocades that are used in decoration really li^ht them 
up wonderfully well ; hut if the purse allows but one nice dress, tliat one 
should, by all means, be all black, and depend for illununation upon tlie 
little accessories of ribbons, tichus, etc., which will make it more or less 
dressy as required. Every woman who cares for appearance — ^and everv one 
ought to do that — ought, if she can possibly affora it, to own a good black 
silk dress. Alpaca is good; cashmere is better; other black materials are 
very satisfactory ; but nothing ^ives one such a comfortable feeling of self- 
respect as black silk. Silk is still very cheap, the fancy makes particularly 
so. It would cost a good deal to get a really rich plain black silk, for such :i 
dress requires to be richer than one with a stripe, dot or figure, and will aI.S(.> 
need richer trimmings. Better no silk than a p(X)r, flimsy, plain one, which 
soon turns shabby and betraj's the purchaser's trust. 

Patience and practice work miritcies in dressmaking, and the amateur will, 
in cultivating both, learn to study her own figure and brjng out its gootl 
points in a way that no professor of the art will oe likely to do. 

INTEIXIGENT SHOPPING. 

There are a few things that every shopiier ought to know. She should, 
for one thing, know exc^tly how much money it is proper or expedient 
to spend for a certain article. Of course, she is not ooliged to expend 
the entire sum, if she has the good fortune to find what she wants at 
a lower price, but, the limit being fixed, she should have resolution 
enough not to be tempted to exceed it. In all probability the sum has 
been determined with reference to other needs, and if one purchase is al- 
lowed to overstep the margin, there will be inconvenient curtailing in oilier 
directions. With the stern fact of a slender purse to be kept in mind, 
it is weak in the shopper to spend her own time, and the salesman's, look- 
ing at expensive goods which are beyond her reach. The sight of such 
fabrics, contrasting with the more humble ones which must of necessity 
be her choice, will be apt to produce dissatisfaction. 

Quite important it is. also, for the economical shopper to be aware of 
the quantity of material she will need. Rapid calculations made at tlie 
time of purchasing are very unreliable, and an ap])eal to the salesman will 
do little good, because the desire to make a sale will oft«n prompt that 
person to suggest a smaller quantity than is needful. On the paper pat- 
terns sold by dealers the quantity of goods required is usually set down, 
but an economical cutter can often make the garment from a smaller num- 
ber of yards than tliat given. A liberal quantity is mentioned, to allow for 
inexperience and more or less wastefulness upon the cutter's part It 
would be wise, after selecting a pattern, to measure it, and decide by turn- 
ing the pieces about till every advantage gained by dovetailing them in 
and out may be taken note oi. There are many ladies who manage to re- 
duce the amount of cloth usually required for a dress, so greatly, that the 
saving thus made is quite a consideration. In expensive goods the saving 
of a yard or two will go a long way toward the purchase of another dress. 

Very excellent managers have been known to cut all the required parts 
of a polonaise, jacket, or whatever form the pattern is in, from paper, (in 
cases where the pattern does not give duplicate sections), to better enable 
them to make the closest calculation as to the amount required. Such 
painstaking is sometimes laughed at and termed fiissiness, but, depend 
\l\^o\\ it, any method which enables a woman in narrow circumstances to 
save a dollar, even, should be above derision. To show that the sum thus 
saved may be of some magnitude, the case of two ladies in New York 
may be named, who bought silk dresses from the same piece. The silk 
was four dollais a yard, and the dresses were to be made in the same style. 
One lady referred to her dressmaker for the amount of yards necessary, 
the other made her own calculation in the manner just spoken of, and 



DRESS MAKING AT HOMR 605 

bought two yards less. Her dress appeared, after being made, to be as am- 
ple as her fnend*s, and she had the reward of her deliberate forethought 
m the saving of eight dollars. Probal^Jy, the other dress was honestly made, 
for the quantity supplied was far from exorbitant, but less careful cutting 
made the diti'ereuce. 

How much, or, rather, how little, material will it be safe to purchase for 
making into a silk dress, is a question often asked by ladies who are obliged 
to count the cosh of every thing very narrowly. It is a question that could 
be answered more accurately regarding a single individual than in the ab- 
stract, but it is safe to say that, with careful cutting, a polonaise and sim- 
ply-trimmed skirt can be made from thirteen or fourteen yanls of silk, 
according to the height of the lady. The upper part of the skirt can he 
of black lawn, or, instead of continuing the silk to the bottom of the skirt, 
it may be pieced down with lining, beginning where the ruffle is put on. 
Even if more material is purchased, it is more prudent to piece out the 
skirt with other goods, and save some of the silk to use when the time for 
making over comes. 

For ladies who live out of town, the present facilities for selecting from 
samples sent by mail simplify shopping greatly. Almost all merchants in 
large cities are very obliging about sending samples, and, even if the ex- 
press charges on the goods ordered adds something to the cost, it is a trifle 
compared to the expense of visiting the city. \Vith the samples before 
one at home, one can make a cooler choice aiid use better judgment than 
when in a store, and country buyers have, on this score, a great advantage 
over town shoppers. 

Among the many points to be considered in the selection of a winter 
dress, is its possibility for turning upside down and wron^de out, when 
its future destiny may demand such transformation. It is also desirable 
to have goods that can be dyed, and, on that account, mixtures of silk and 
wool should be avoided. There are also other objections to this class of 
goods. They are liable to change color when exposed to dampness, and will 
sometimes shrink and ** cockle up" in a way tnat makes them unsightly, 
and often useless. All-wool materials, such as serge, cashmere, flannels and 
debeges, and all the goods of similar nature sold under various names, are 
far more satisfaclory, and are often cheaper, even at the first cost, than 
the fancy mixtures. 

For those ladies who are obliged to follow some out-of-door avocation, 
such as carrying a .^subscription hook, selling some articles from house to 
house, or any pursuit which requires them to brave all weathers, the most 
serviceable winter dress will be one of camlet, linsey or frieze-cloth. Kither 
of these will be very satisfactory, if a grade is selected which is woven of 
pui*e worsted, with no mixture of cotton or any other fabric. If the mate- 
rial is bougiit at a reliable place, the dealer will be willing to point out 
the difference between the mixed and unmixed worsted material, but (the 
former not always beinc etisy to find) irresponsible persons will sometimes 
attempt to |)alm off" the latter ui)on the inexperienced. A jacket or snct^ue 
like the dress can be wadded and lined, and, if neatly made after a stylish 
pattern, will complete a walking costume that any lady might l>e willing to 
wear. ^ Such a suit in dark grav, or " pepper and salt,"* made with emigrant 
skirt bordered with three or live rows of black braid, and easj' fitting coat 
of the same, similarly trimmed, will be more stylish, and command more 
resi>ect for the wearer than a half- worn silk or cashmere whose trimming 
show stains of travel and dust, whose draperies have the dejected look 
common to long worn ornamentation. It is not to be supposed that the 
economist must never take advantage of a special bargain ; but she must 
be wary, lest she is dazzled by cheapness ana tempted into buying some- 
thing that she could have gone without, and saved the money for a beti- 
ter use. 

The habit of making a list, every season, of the things absolutely needed* 

39 



"606 DBESS MAKING AT HOME. 

with their probable cost, will assist an economical shopper very mncli In 
making her purchases, and dispose her to shun showy so-called bargains, 
unless she sees one that will supply spme item set down in iier list, or can 
be profitably substituted for something therein. Even then she should use 
very deliberate judgment, and carefully refrain from buying in baste to 
regret at leisure. 

Merchants in cities are, at certain times, in the habit of offering, as bar* 
gains, the fragments of Uie last season's stock to clear them out before new 
goods are exhibited. These bargains are sold (very often) for any thing 
that they will bring. Experienced economists find this their golden oppor* 
tunity, and rarely fail to take advantage of its coming. Remnants of sum- 
mer goods are to be found often at a quarter of the price asked for them 
on their tirst appearance, and, with a little taste and a clever knack at 
securing an imitation of some of the many fashions of the day, it is an 
easy thing to effect an ingenious arrangement of a few yards of new goods 
upon an old dress that will delude the public into tlie belief that the 
whole costume is as new as it is elegant The point having been thor- 
oughly settled, ttiat close following of passing styles is incompatible with 
systematic economy, the woman of small means will not hesitate to make 
her dollar do double dutv by spending it for some of these kept-over 
goods without troubling herself with anxious doubts and fears lest they 
should not be in the latest of the ruling modes. Her choice among them, 
if her taste and judgment are good, will be those that are ouiet and in- 
conspicuous in color and pattern. Such dresses, be the fashion what it 
may, are always ladylike and in good style. There are some standard 
goods that are never obsolete; but because each season brinss its own 
trivial variation in the shade of a color, the thickness of a twill, or some 
such unimportant feature, the infinitesimal change depreciates, in the eyes 
of large dealers, the materials of lost year. Narrow stripes, fine checks and 
small dots are all unremarkable, and, not coming within the range of ar* 
bitrary fashions, are never out of date, and no one need ever be ashamed 
of wearing them. Prints, cambrics, calicoes, ginghams, and all the great 
varieties of the previous year's supply of cotton goods, are generally to be 
found among the bargains shown at such times; and there is no better 
opportunity for laying in a stock for children's summer dresses, or for their 
mothers and older sisters. Alwavs make up cotton dresses without lining. 
They can be washed and ironed easily, and look almost as well as new 
after each time of laundrying. With a waist lining there is apt to be a 
shrinkage and drawing out of place in either the lining or outside that 
hinders the iron from doing its work nicely. For those who have to do 
actual hard work, such as washing, scrubbing, etc., it may be well, now tliat 
the material is so much thinner than of old to make dark calico working 
dresses with waist linings of unbleached muslin to help to resist the strain 

J>roduced by consttyit motion of the arms; but for ordinary housework a 
oosely-fitting unlined waist with simply a stay or facing under the arms, is 
Suite strong enough. It would also be sufficiently so for the hardest work 
peoi)le were in the habit of making the calicoes worn for such use, 
simply with a skirt and half-fitting sacque. Many ladies make the calico 
skirts of working dresses of straight !)readths and no gores in order that, 
when partially worn out, the front may he turned around to the back, thus 
bringing stronger breadths into the place of those which are thin and faded. 
The gathers are ripped from the wai.stband and the skirt turned upside 
down. After a new lease of life has in this way been secured to the skirt, 
there should be some way of renovating the upper portion, perhaps new 
sleeves, and, possibly, a renewal of the lower portions of the front if the 
waist is in sacque form. 

The most economical and convenient time for making common dresses 
is at a season when more elalx)rate dresses are not in preparation. For 
calicoes and ginghams it will be safe to select any of the simpler styles o(

CUTTING. 

In catting goods, economy of material is a consideration never to l»e lost 
Bight of. Make a close calculation before using the scissors at all, and do not 
cut any part out until you have discovered the very best way of using tlie 
cloth to advantage. It will pay one to be very deliberate and take no stei> 
without due consideration. Of course, professional hands become so en- 
tirely familiar with their occupation that it does not demand much thought, 
but beginners will do well to ponder and plan and calculate closely the very 
best and most econonomical way of getting a garment out of a given quan- 
tity of cloth. Large patterns are desirable for dresses and some other things* 
but for most garments just enough is the best quantity to have. The extra 
half yard, or whatever portion is found to he in excess of the right length, is 
often useless, and with cloth, or other costly material, adds j[>rovokingly to 
the exjjense of a cloak, sacque, or whatever the garment may be. 

People who economize very rigidly sometimes argue that buying paj^er pat- 
terns adds too much to the cost of garments to be prudent purchases; out 
that seems like faulty reasoning in most cases, tor the time, strenj^^h £ nd 
lalx)r spent in experimenting, to say notliing oi the eventual iKisc'.o't wast- 
ing of material, would more than cover the cost of tne model, -t is an ex- 
cellent idea for two or three friends to unite and purc*iase paper patterns 
together, dividing the expense between them, and selectnig medium sizes, 
which would be readily adapted to their diflerent degrees of sleuderness or 
breadth. 

If the dress is being made by a person of no experience, it will be well to 
cut the pattern out of old material, baste it together and.trv it on ; this not 
so much to correct possible defects in the pattern as to guard against the mis- 
takes of inexperience, though even these need not be made if accurate care 
is used in following the i)atterns. 

In regard to cutting-out to the best advantage, imagine that the reader of 
this, having, fortunately for herself, finished making her own clothes, is 
about to make a polonaise for her small daughter or sister. Let her select the 
pattern she wishes, and, if it is a new one, cut &fac-simiU of it in old cloth, 
Dast^ together and try on, making any slight alteration in waist or shoulder 
seams that may be needed. Then let her ascertain the width of the material 
decided on, and calculate as nearly as possible the quantity needed — say it is 
three yards and a half of twenty-seven inch goods. With a piece of chalk 
let her mark off in>on the car|H't a section of that length and width, and lay 
the different fwirts of tlie pattern within it« linnts. turning and replacing 
them again and again till they are assuredly arranged to tne l>est jwssible ad- 
vantage, and the whole garment made to absorb the smallest amount of clotli 
that is practicable. Of course the idea must be kept in view of a right and 
wrong side to the cloth, or an up-and-down to the figure, it there is one ; l>ut 
a little study and thought, after the pieces are placed, will correct any mis- 
take of that kind. Then it is well, before talking up the i>nttern and brush- 
ing the chalk-line from the carpet, to make a rough sketch or outline of the 
position it occupied u\yon the floor, and not trust altogether to memory to 
re-arrange it uiH)n cloth. All this performance seems rather formidable, but 
if a beginner will take the trouble to go through with it for a few times, she 
will find it like learning a trade, and a little experience will make her so 
thoroughly mistress of it that she will no longer need to be subject to such 
prelimmaries, but will, almost by intuition, lay the pieces of the pattern to 



608 DBESS MAKING AT HOME. 

the best ad*'antage, and acquire the very desirable accomplishment of ont^ 
ting well and economically. To possess such an art one should be willingf 
to take a little trouble and make some exertion. 

In cutting a dress leave the sleeves and trimming till the last, then par- 
ings of gores and other pieces can be used up. Don't be afraid of piecing. 
The sleeves should be whole, if possible, upon the upper parts, but the un- 
der parts may be made of patcnwork, if necessary, .especially where the 
upper part is wide. Even where both parts are of equal width care, inge- 
nuity, and a little practice, make it possibb to use up very small pieces 
when material is scant. The waist also may be piecea more than an ordi- 
nary dressmaker, whose time is money, can afford ; but if you make your 
nwn drevsses you can sometimes get one out of a surprisingly scant pattern,. 
if you are patient and ingenious about piecing. The fropts may be faced 
instead of hemmed, and narrow pieces may be put under the arms with- 
out being noticed. If necessary, in a basque or polonaise, all the parts may 
be joined at the waist. In making over a dress quite short pieces may l>e 
used to advantage in this way. It is also possible, when sorely driven by 
necessity, to piece the fronts from the armsize across, and craftily coveV 
the seam by arranging the trimming to represent a square neek. Not more 
than an inch, if any, of the seam need be visible between the trimming and 
the armsize, and that will hardly be observed. 

In cutting a basque or waist from an untried pattern, cut the lining first, 
baste it up and try it on ; then, if any trifling alterations are necessary, 
they can be made, and the goods cut accordins; to the improvements. Cut 
it as long as the basque is to be, but if it is for a polonaise or re^lingote, 
it need be only five or six inches below the wsustline. Soft twilled iiiuslia 
makes the best lining ; that which is stiff and unpliable is very objection- 
able, as it is not only hard to fit, but soon stretches out of shape and 
leaves the dress goods over it without proper support. Dark linings, even 
foV dark dresses, are now less in use than light White is much used by 
dressmakers, but it soils too easily to be altogether unobjectionable. The 
best color is a pearl, or very light gray. For calico dresses, even for win- 
ter, the waist lining shoulcf always be white, as, in washing, the color of a 
dark lining will run into and cloud th« colors of the calico. Both lining 
and outside of the waist should be cut the straight way of the cloth, ana 
the seams and darts must be creased on the lining exactly by the pattern, 
which must be pinned evenly upon it Lay^ the lining upon the length 
of the goods, being very j)articular to have it perfectly straight, and ar- 
range the different pieces in a manner to save as much cloth as possible. 
If saving is a great object, facings can be sewed on the edges of botn fronts^ 
and no hems turned. By moving the pieces about it will be easy, where 
there is no up and down, to get the side pieces out between some of the 
lar^r parts. In basting the pieces together, after they are secured to the 
lining, be very particular to match them as the paper pattern indicates, 
following the creases exactly. To secure greater precision, it is best to 
mark the creases with a lead {)encil. One can not.oe too particular about 
hese darts, as they have much to do with the fit of the dress. Having 
i>asted the side-bodies evenly to the back, tack the fronts and back toother 
upon the shoulders and under the arms, the darts having been previously 
basted up by the marks on the pattern. Try on the w^aist, and, if it ie 
right, sew up the seams on the sewing maehine and work the button-hole- 
Before cutting these (if the goods ravel very easy) outline each one by a 
row of machine stitching, leaving only room to cut the button-hole between 
the lines of stitching, and, in working it, take the stitches deep enough to 
cover the line, the same as when it is run around by hand. If it does not 
fit, the amateur dressmaker need not fall into despair, for, probably, a 
judicious taking in of the seams will make it all right If the dress is for 
a person with some peculiarities of figure it will be necessary to study 
that in fitting; if, for instance^ the waist is very tapering, the seams wiU 



DBESS MAKING AT HOME. 609 

liave to be more deeply sloped than the paper pattern being cut for the 
iiverage figure will indicate. If the person being fitted has a hoUowine 
K»ack, a plait or dart laid in the middle of th^ back of the lining will 
lecure a oetter fit. 

Long seams in the back, extending to the shoulder, are more becoming 
k> stout people than side bodies ending at the tirmsize. If the 8houlder» 
project, an allowance can be made by leaving the back longer than the 
tides. If one shoulder is more prominent than the other, the defect should 
be skillfully disguised by putting a layer of cotton upon the other side, 
lo that the difference need not be noticed. If the arms are very thin, a 
sheet of cotton may be put between the outside and the lining of the 
upper part. Many dressmakers follow this plan, wherever the arm is not 
too large to admit admit of it, to secure a well -fitting slee^'e, the short 
shoulders now worn to dresses requiring some adroitness in putting them 
in nicely, unless the material is thicK like velvet, or is made so by- 
wadding 

The next step in making the dress is to finish the sleeves. They should 
be slipped on the arm while the waist is on, and pinned to the sKoulders. 
Very much depends upon the fit of the sleeves, and, even if cut from the 
best of patterns, they may wrinkle and set awry unless put into the arm- 
hole properly. The latter must not be too tight or cut out too much in 
the back. 

After a basque or polonaise is finished, it should have a strong belt 
sewed to the back and side seams, upon the inside, to fasten the front, for 
the double purpose of keeping the waist in place and relieving the strain 
upon the buttons. 

Putting a garment together when it is carefully cut is a much easier task 
than when the separate pieces are not accurate, and require much measur- 
ing and trimming before they can be nicely adjusted to each other. If 
lining is put into either a part or the whole of an article it must be tacked 
upon the back of the pieces before they are basted together. Care must be 
taken in basting not to stretch the seams out of shape. In making up cloth. 
the seams, after being stitched upon a sewing machine, should l:)e laid 
upon and pressed down with a heavy hot iron. Each raw edge may then 
be bound with a narrow ribbon or galloon. This will give a neat finish 
to the wrong side and and keep the threads from raveling. In very thick 
cloth the seams, after pressing, should have a galloon laid over them, and 
hemmed dow*n slightly, not letting the stitches show upon the right side ; 
or, with a cloth with a shaggy face, the seam may be sewed up and fin- 
ished at the back with a wide fell, which must be pressed flat. Thin ma- 
terials, such as mohairs, grenadines, etc., if made up without lining, are 
most neatly finished if the pieces are stitched together on the right side 
and then turned and sewed again upon the wrong side. This keeps the 
garment in better shape than the usual running and felling. 

The next thing upon the programme after putting on whalebone casings, 
is to face the bottom of the basque. It is then ready for the trimming, 
which can be put on in accordance with the taste of "the designer. Many 
ladies wear adjustable waist trimmings. A bias band of the material, foV 
instance, with both edges trimmed with gimi) or tiny side- plai tings, which 
goes around the neck and meets or crosses in front, half-way between the 
fchroat and belt. This is left off at pleasure, to make room for a dainty- 
fichu of mull or colored silk, or for a becoming little slioulder cape of 
beads. These very expensive-looking little adjuncts to a dressy toilet can 
be made at home by ladies who have any leisure to spend in fancv work. 
Almost everj' young person has some nnddle-aged friend who will teach 
her how to make the bead fringes which, in former days, decorated the 
square ends of crotcheted silk purses. Those fringes were made of fin© 
steel beads, and the netted heading done with an ordinary sewing needle. 
The beads now used are cut-jets of a much larger size, and three rows of 



610 DRESS MAKING A T HOME. 

the fringe are set upon a lace foundation, or even sewed together over » 
paper pattern, without other foundation than a row of gimp between each 
fringe, which is concealed 4y the falling strands of beads. Trimmings for 
the tahliers of rich dresses are made in a similar manner by some ladies, 
who also imitate wi til their own ingenious tineers the gor^ous seventy-five 
and fifty -dollar fabricrs which are sold in modest quantities for trimming. 

In cutting a dress from plaid goods, if the check is at all conspicuous, it 
must be arranged with care, or very ugly effects will be produced. On the 
waist, particularly, the plaids should match exactly where the fronts meet. 
In cutting out gixids that are striped, have a whole stripe appear in the cen- 
ter of tl»e front, and have the side-forms in the back present a perfectly- 
mntched appearance. The same attention should be paid to the sleeves, hav- 
iii.^ a care, as in all materials, tjiat the parts above the elbows run with the 
threaci lenjjthwavs of the cloth. If the sleeve pattern is too short, len^hen 
it equally at both ends; unless this is observed, the set of it will changed. 

A round skirt is easily made with an old, well-fitting skirt, or a paper pat^ 
tern as a guide. The .straight side of each eore must be toward the fronts 
The seam in the front is not to be endured, and one in the back is to be 
avoided, if possible, u)M)n any skirt which is not to be worn beneath a polo- 
naisfc or overskirt: but for an underskirt all things are possible in the way of 
piocingH and joinings. In making a trained or demi-trained skirt, if it should 
api)ear scjinty and hoop in the back, make a cut in the edge deep enough to 
relieve it, and set in a V-shaped gore, which may be concealed oy the trim- 
ming, or cut shorter slits upon each side and set in gores. 

Machine stitching is used upon dresses and trimmings. Even cashmere 
and silk ruffles are hemmed on the machine instead of being laboriously 
blind-stitehed, although the latter mode is not out of date with those who do 
not mind trouble. It is now acknowledged by the best dressmakers that 
nothing equals coarse alpaca or brilliantine for a skirt facing. Nearly every 
color can be matched in it. and it looks well, wears well and sheds the dirt 
admirablv. Braid is now usually put on the back of the skirt and not felled 
down as formerly. About a third of its width is allowed to project below 
the Hkirt. which is thought to hang better than when bound with the braid. 
It should be sewed on by hand after the dress is finished, not set in between 
the facing and outside, as is s^imetimes done. When it becomes ragged it ia 
a simple matter to rip it ofif and put on a fresh one. 

RENOVATING. 

If the silk is very dirty, spread each breadth on a large table, and sponge 
it ui)on both sides with warm water mixed with ox gall. — Rinse the silk sev- 
eral times in clear cold water, changing the water each time. Then sponge 
it upon the wrong side with a very weak solution of glue. Try the experi- 
ment first on a scrap of the goods till you find it as stiff as new silk should 
be. Dry the silk, and then roll it up in a damp towel and after two or three 
hours iron it upon the wrong side with a moderately hot iron. 

Black, and some dark shades of cashmere, may be cleaned by the same 
]>rf)ce.ss. 

Where a black silk has a shiny, greasy look, its freshness can frequently be 
restored by sponging it with anmionia without ripping up the dress. Where 
a silk of any color becomes more defaced with spots than actually soiled, the 
spots can be removed by rubbing them with a mixture made by putting h^f 
an oinice of camphor and an ounce of borax in boiling water, and adding to 
it when cool a teacup of alcohol and half that quantity of ammonia. 

A favorite way of cleaning and restoring silk, is by sponging it with a prep- 
aration made by boiling a large, unpeeled potato and a kid glove together for 
a longtime. The glove should of the color of the silk, and if the shade ia 
very Tight, the im)UiIo must have the skin removed before boiling. After th* 
mixture is cool add a small qiumtity of ammonia if the silk is very dirty* 



DBES8 MAKING AT HOME. 611 

Noglue or gnm will be needed, as the glove furnishes the proper degree of 
stlfiSning. After sponging and wiping, with a dry cloth, fold the silk in as 
nearly as possible the form of new silK, or rollo^ upon a rod covered with 
tiiick cloth. Avoid ironing it if possible, as the Texture of the silk is better 

S reserved without the application of heat; but if the wrinkles do not 
isappear, press it on the wrong side with as cool an iron as can be efficiently 
used. The glove and potato treatment is excellent for restoring black of afl 
kinds, even veils and shawls. 

Another way of cleaning black silk is first to thoroughly brush and wipe 
with a cloth, then lay flat on a board or table and sponge well with hot coflfee 
thoroughly freed from sediment by being strained through muslin. iSponge 
on the side intended to show, allow to become partially dry and then iron on 
the wrong side. The coffee removes every particle of grease and restores the 
brilliancy of silk without imparting to it either the shiny appearance or 
cracklv and papery stififhess obtained by beer or, indeed, any otlier liquid. 
The silk really appears thickened by the process, and this good effect is per- 
manent 

The following method of 'cleaning silks has many advocates, and is said 
to be admirably adapted for delicate evening shades: To a quarter of & 
pound of soft soap put a teaspoonful of sugar and a large cofieecupful ol 
alcohol. Wet the silk all over with the mixture, then rinse it in several 
waters, being careful not to crease it Let it dry partially, and iron it 
upon the wrong side, unless it is smooth enough after rubbing with a soft 
towel. There is a great difference in silks in this respect Some that are 
very soft and of rich equality will be smooth and unwrinkled after cleaning, 
if simply smoothed with the hands and carefully folded ; others need thor- 
ough pressing with an iron to put them in good shaj^. Heat takes the- 
stiffening from silk, and, if it is found necessary to iron it, it is well to 
dry it and then dampen with water in which a little gum or glue has been 
dissolved. The wisest way, as suggested above, Is, in any of the methods 

S'ven to try the whole process upon a small piece of the silk to be cleaned, 
bservation will then indicate*!! any change is needed in the operation. 
All of these receipts have been tried with very good results; but to get a 
good result in cleaning silk takes time, patience and backache. 

If silk, after having been done over, or refinished, as it is called, looks 
well enough to make up again as a dress, it is very important that new 
linings should be used. Save the old ones to line every-day dresses, but be- 
sure to buy new waist and sleeve linings for the silk, or it will fall into 
the creases and folds that wearing has produced in the muslin, and have an 
old expression in spite of all the trouble that it has cost If the silk is to 
be cut up for trimmings it will pay to line them. Bias frilLs and side^ 
plaited ruffles can be lined with coarse Swiss and folds and bias bands in- 
terlined with old thin muslin which has been nicely starched and ironed. 
Attention to these small details will do much toward giving a new look to 
the material. 

Grease spots in any goods should be taken off as soon as they appear, aa 
they yield to treatment much more readily before dirt finds a lodgment in 
them. Benzine is one of the best a^jcmcies in use for removing grease from 
woolen dresses. Some people consider it best to wet the spot first with 
cold water, and apply the benzine within the circumference of the water- 
mark, asserting that eVen upon colored silk fabrics no trace of the benzine 
will be left after exposure to the air. 

Taking out spots which have destroyed or impaired the original color is 
a 'difficult matter and one that will need experimenting upon in each ca.se. 
Sometimes a mixture of camphor iand borax is efficacious, and in others 
strong beer is a beneficial application. If acids have caused the trouble, a 
weak solution of ammonia will often have a good effect. Sometimes au 
application of liquid blacking upon the faded or discolored spot mends the 
matter, but that succeeds best on material that has a nap or rough surface. 



612 DBESS MAKING AT HOMK 

A solution made l>y boiling log^i'ood chips in a little water is said to be 
very good for restoring tiie color of black castimere and tbe other smooth 
woolen goods. It sliould b^ applied to the spot with a sponge, and the op- 
eration should be repeated several times, drying the goods after each ap- 
plication, and linally pressing it with a warm iron. 

Men have been heard to say that women never brush their dresses. How- 
ever untrue that sweeping assertion may be, it is certain that too little at- 
tention is paid to freeing dresses from the dust of the house and soil of 
the street. It is an excellent plan, upon taking off a dress, to brush it 
carefully all over with a small (not too stiff) wisp broom, giving particular 
care to all trimmings where plaits or gathers make lodgments for the dust. 
If there is much uix)n the dress, rub it off with a coarse towel or a wad 
of worsted goods. An excellent brush for cleaning woolen or silk dresses 
caTi be made by covering a square block of wood with furniture plush. 

Ladies who are in mourning suffer much inconvenience from the injury 
caused by drops of water falling upon their crape, for each drop makes a 
conspicuous white mark. If, while wet, these are clapped between the 
lianas until dry, no spots will appear. If the crape has dried without their 
removal, lay it upon a table and out under spots a piece of old black silk ; 
dip a cameVs hair pencil in black ink and paint the spots lightly; then 
wipe them off with old soft silk^ and the color will be restored. 

rartly worn fabrics may often be profitably renewed by calling in the 
dyer's art Some people have excellent success in usin^ tamily dyes, and 
for them it will be an object to color many useful things, for which it 
would not be worth while to pay a professional dyer's charge. Ribbons, 
neckties, trimmings and many small things which need patience and care- 
ful manipulation can be colored beautifully at home. Stockings, linings, 
and odds and ends that might not otherwise be used, can also be advan- 
tageously subjected to the amateur process, but for material that is to be re- 
made into dresses it would be wisdom to employ the best professional 
skill. Some things, such as merinos and cashmere, are worth dyeing at 
almost any price, and will look like new when they are done. Silk dyes 
well for some purposes, but will never look like new after the process, even 
if the dyer promises that it will; hence it is a mistake to use it conspic- 
uously after dyeing. It can be used as the basis of a costume, where the 
lines are broken by drapery, etc., or it will cut up admirably for trim- 
mings, but large surfaces of it should be avoided, as giving opportunity 
for the eye to catch sundry symptoms, such as streaks and a general limp- 
ness, which at once reveal the secret. 

Irish poplins dye well, but have the one objection of shrinking lament* 
ably. This should be taken into consideration in purchasing one of light 
color, and an extra piece, sufficient for a new waist, should be included 
in the original quantity. 

Velvets can be colored, but although the nap is beautifully raised when 
done by an expert, they lose much in appearance, and a velvet which co«t 
ten dollars a yard will have the general expression of one which costs lesy 
than a quarter of that sum. The cost of dyeing velvet is very great, and 
with such a result to be expected as has just been explained, it would be 
much better to buy good new cotton-back, silk-faced velvet. 

Nearly all wool materials, unless too loo.«?ely woven, color well, but mix- 
tures of cotton and wool will not pay for the cost of dyeing. Japanese 
silks and silk-faced matelasses do not dye satis factorily. 

White woolen goods will not, as jjeople seem to think, take every color; 
on the contrary, there are but few shades that they will become. Light 
and Mexican-blue, nut-brown, slate, stone color, lavender, jacqueminot, scar- 
let, rose \ and several of the very dark new shades are those which can be 
most certainly obtained. The reason for this limitation is because the sul- 
phur with which the wool is whitened in the manufacture prevenis most 
colors from taking hold evenly, to use a technical expression.

AIpacA is an exception to most fabrics composed of two materials. It 
dyes well and does not siirink verj^ much, 

*ln most materials slate color will dye black, ^x>wn, claret, green, purple 
and dark blue. 

Light blue will dye medium and navy-blue, purple, crimson, green, 
prune, claret and black. 

Claret will dye brown, black, crimson and bottle green. 

Brown will dve darker brown, claret, black and green. 

Amber will dye green, scarlet, crimson, black and brown. 

Crimson will dye black, brown, claret and dark green. A lighter shade 
of crimson will dye black, brown, claret, dark green, blue, and a darker 
self -shade. 

Drab will dye scarlet, crimson, green—both light and dark— purple, dark 
blue, and claret 

Light green will dye claret, brown, black and crimson. 

Dark green will dye brown, black and claret. 

Lavender will dye brown, black, garnet, dark blue, green, plum and 
prune. 

Mauve will dye dark blue, black, claret, crimson, green and purple. 

Navy-blue will dye brown, green, claret and black. 

Magenta will dye purple, scarlet, crimson, aznline and navy-blues, black, 
l)rowns and claret. 

Purple will dye black, dark crimson, claret and dark green. 

Pink will dye blue in most shades, all the reddish tones of color, medium 
and dark blues, black and most of the dark colors, including greens. 

Scarlet will dye dark green and blue, black, brown, garnet and crimson 

Straw color will take almost any color except light blue, lavender and 
pink 

Slate will dye green, purple, plum, navy-blue, several shades of brown 
and black. 

Black and all the dark colors, if grown rusty or faded, can be dyed again 
the original color. They may turn out a little darker, but unless the ma- 
terial has ugly spots which require more dye to conceal, the color will be 
nearly the same as when new. 

Plaid goods, if thick and unmixed with cotton, will often take a plain 
ml or, which should be at least as dark as the darkest shade in the pattern. 
Black and white checks prove an exception to this; as, if skillfully done, 
they can be dyed scarlet or light blue, the white blocks taking the color 
and' the black remaining black. 

It is damaging to dresses and other ^rments to lie by in a faded and 
dirty state ; therefore, if coloring them is in anticipation, it is best to pre- 
j»are and send them to the dyers. After they are redressed they can be 
lavd away till required, and will take no harm. 

Velveteen will dye and look very well at first, but being all cotton its 
renewed good looks fade very quickly. For furniture or house decoration 
it might pay to have it done, but otherwise H is hardly to be advocated.

children's CLOTHING. 

Very few grown people understand the hardship it is to little folks to 
wear outgrown or clumsy or ill-fitting garments. Boys are not supposed to 
have their feelings greatlv harrowed at the sight of handsomer clothes 
than their own. but even tYiey are quite alive to the mortification of weaiv 
ing shabby or ill-cut and ill-made coats and trowsers. The trial falls most 
severely upon little girls, and to them it is a bitter one, and just as hard 
to be borne as the afflictions of grown people are. With a keen eye for 
beauty, and often a natural or cultivated taste, a poor child is sometimes 
condemned to wear garments of such a hideous character that she loathes

the very thought of them, and actually suffers the most acute ^aorti- 
fication. 

There are mothers who^evote too much thought and time to dressing 
their children, and who, ^ words and acts, lead them to feel that to be 
fashionably and elegantly dressed is the great good of life. Thiss is a la- 
mentable mistake to make, but it is also a mistake for a mother to attempt 
to imbue her child with an indifference to dress or clieck the love of it by 
depriving her of tasteful clothes. An ugly dress draws the thoughts of the 
wearer to itself far more than a pretty, becoming one will, and a forlorn^ 
ill-dressed little ^irl will grow up with a longing for finery that neat and 
pretty dressing will not often develop. 

Thore is a good deal of work about making a dress, even if it is a small 
one, but it is very little more trouble to make it tasteful and stylish, and it 
ns a pleasanter task to create a pretty thing than an ugly one. Like all other 
arts of the home dressmaker, it takes experience to make a success of chil- 
dren's dresses. Amateurs are apt to take fright at the dressy, elaborate- 
styles now in vogue, but really there is nothing appalling about them with 
a plate or pattern to follow, and the most complicated are frequently the- 
mosteasy to copy in old material, because the elaboration hel^ to di^aiae 
many makeshifts In the way of piecing and eking out scanty trimmings. 

A dainty little miss we know of wears a dress for her ** Sunday De3t" 
that looks 'as if it might have been selected from one of the shop window^ 
No one would suspect its beiiie home-made, much less made mostly of a 
fabric no longer new. The foundation was a plain princesse form, cut from 
a thin lining, which, by the by, was originally a light calico morning drea» 
of one of the older sisters. Among the castH:>ff clothes of the family were 
small portions of two very old silk dresses, one a fine black-and-white check, 
the other a plain dark brown. There was not in either enough in quantity 
to do much with alone, but combined there was sufficient to make a very 
gCKxi result. The silk was poor and thin, but it was carefully cleaned aiib 
stiffened, and wherever used furnished with a thin, coarse Swiss muslin 
lining. Long folds of the two silks alternating were put uix)n the front 
hreaath perpendicularly, reaching from the throat to the bottom of the 
dress in tlie ^center. Across the back were narrow gathered ruffles of check 
silk bound with the plain brown. The upper part of the dress was of 
white Angora gauze flannel skirting, which was out twenty cents a yard, 
and resembled a summer camel's hair. The fronts were made in 'sack 
form, meeting over the long center plaits at one point only, about equi- 
distant between the throat and waist, and cut away abruptly above and 
below. The back was long and looped over the ruflSes witli very graceful 
effect. The cuffs were of check silk, with brown bias binding' upon the 
edge, and tlie deep round collar (almost a cape) was in the same order. 
The upper part of the dress was covered with brown silk that was too old 
and poor to be fit for any other use ; but, under the polonaise, the worn 
places did not appear, and the flannel was so thin that it required a con- 
tinuous color beneath to prevent the ugly variegated appearance that some 
8ilk and bunting toilettes present The polonaise was edged with three 
rows of machine chain-stitch ing, done with coarse brown silk, and was 
not a separate garment, being sewed in with the shoulder and side seams, and 
buttoned in the back with brown buttons. 

Another dress of the same little lady's was made from a pair of old Turkey 
red curtains, of the dark color and heavy quality of former manufacture. 
The dress was made with a full skirt gathered round the waist, with five 
rows of shirring. The blouse-waist was gathered in the same way. The 
deep collar, cuns, wide belt, and the binding to two ruffles on the bottom of 
the skirt, were of Madras gingham in indigo-blue shades. The combination 
made a very quaint and stylish dress, and was modeled from a recently im» 
ported one of much more expensive material. 

Another lady who prides herself on her ingenuity made a very neat cloak 



DRESS MAKING AT HOMR 615 

for her girl from an old pair of pants. The fronts and backs were cut of 
narrow pieces (it could not have been otherwi^), with seams extending to 
the shoulder. The pockets and cuffs were in veTy good style, but not of tho 
same material, whicli was a brown basket pattern. Tbe upper parts of the 
aleeves were very presentable, but the under halves were curious mosaics of 
patchwork, telling something of the difficulty with which they succeeded in 
being sleeves at all ; but n'importe, nobody — not even a child — voluntarily 
oifers the under part of a sleeve for inspection, so its secrets need never be 
revealed. 

In making over children's clothes, or elders' clothes for children, there is 
a double advantage in combining more than one material. Fresher parts 
of both can be used, and harmonious arrangement of colors diverts the eye 
from the want of newness that might be apparent in a plainer dress, in 
making use of diverse fabrics, there is, however, one all-important thing to 
be kept in mind — there must be a certain harmony in color and method 
in arrangement observed, or the effect will be disastrous. There a' 3 people 
with artistic .tastes to whom the knowledge of what is fitting and appropriate 
seems to come instinctively, and they need no advice; but there are many 
busy mothers living so far from our great cities and so off from the line of 
travel that they have but little opportunity for cultivating their tastes or of 
seeing what is fashionable, and often but little time to give the subject much 
thought 

In reading over the ordinary articles upon children's fashions, one is con- 
stantly struck with the similarity of the materials advised for their clothing, 
to those used for grown people! There seem to be no especial fabrics re- 
served' for their use. This fact should be particularly comforting to those 
whose circumstances compel them to prepare their children's clothing from 
their stock on hand, which stock is generally understood to be the worn-out 
dresses of mother and sisters. When there was a marked difference between 
the styles of child and adult, the wearing cast-off dresses of their elders was 
a real and bitter trial to little girls ; but there is no trouble about it now. 
Nearlj' every thing that is wearable can be stylishly used under the present 
laws which govern fashion. Plaids and large figures, which mieht be gro- 
tesque in whole dresses, make very nice vests and trimmings to liglit up dull- 
looking costumes. 

Old brown or black woolen dresses that have grown rusty and faded, but 
liave capabilities of usefulness, can be refreshed by steeping in a weak de- 
<50Ction of logwood. Other colors in all-wool can be re-dyed at home with 
the ordinary family dyes. It should be rememberec' that it is much easier to 
xe-color goods the same shade than it is to make an entire change of hue. 
It is best to match the color that the material was originally, and saturate 
it in the preparation, following the usually accompanying printed direc- 
tions about drying, pressing, etc. It is a pity to spend time and trouble in 
making up dresses which will look foriorn in spite of tlie pains lavished 
upon them, when a previous re-dyeing would have made such a wonderful 
fjhange in their appearance. 

The present very universal fashion of shirring dresses and trimmings is 
admirably adapted to make over old materials into children's clothes. 
Worn-out ruffles can be closely j^therod, or gauged, as the term is, and all 
the holes and thin places made invisible by the process. If, for instance, 
a prudent mother has laid aside the flounces from some old skirt she has 
long ago taken for a petticoat or other use, she will now reap the benefit of 
faer carefulness, and find herself able to make her child a dress at little 
cost. Let her cut a cambric skirt of a proper size, and cover it with the 
flounces, shirred at each edge with two gatherings, and a similar row through 
the middle. The shirrings may run around the skirt, and the lapping of the 
ruffles 'may be concealed by a row of galloon or velvet, or the flounces may 
all be pieced together before the shirrs are made. The gathers should be 
distributed evenly, and sewed firmly down upon tlie cambric. 



616 DBESS MAKING AT HOMK 

Another mode of using the ruffles Ss to set them on the skirt perpendic^ 
ularly ; in this case, the middle shirr may be omitted in each raffle, unless 
they are over five inches wide. If that style does not meet with approval, 
a puff (made of the flounces) mav alternate with a close strip of shirring of 
equal width with the shirring all the way around. Again, if it is desirable 
to piece out a scanty pattern, it will do to make the lower part of the 
skirt of the ruffles closely shirred, and cover the rest of it with ,the dreaa 
material. Both waists and sleeves, or either one alone, or deep yokes and 
cuffs, may be entirely made of fine shirring, which, it will reamly be seen, • 
affords a fine opportnnit^ for using up irregular-shaped pieces of old ma- 
terial, as it is oi very little consequent how many piecmgs are put into 
any thin^ that is so closely gathered up, always supposing that -the Indus* 
trious toiler has time and patience to do the*^ piecing. Unlimited patience 
seems to be the attribute of nearly all mothers, but time, the economical 
ones seem, alas, to have in but a limited supply. 

It is cruel to condemn little girls, with their natuially dainty tastes and 
love for pretty thin^, to wearing ugly, ill-fashioned clothes ; but even made 
out of such matenals as this article treats of, they can be as pretty, if not 
not so durable, as if new material were used. 

The subject of boys* wear needs consideration, for there is no direction 
in which the amateur's failures are so distressingly palpable as in boys' 
clothes. The unfortunate little sons of poor, industrious mothers too often 
are condemned to wear garments that give them a hopelessly awkward ap- 
pearance. Orowing boys, at their best, are not miracles of grace, but well- 
made clothes do wonders for them; and it is worth while for those who 
have the work to do to study to acquire the tailors* style of finishing^ 
garments, without which they are certain to have an uncouth, home- 
made air that condems them at once. It is quite possible to learn thi» 
art by a little practice and cloee imitation of the finish that is found 
on coats and other articles of tailors* workmanship. The secret of style in 
men's clothes is in pressing — not such pressing as people ordinarily do with 
the ^ntle gliding of a warm smoothing-iron over the cloth — ^but a vigorous 
bearing on with a heavy iron that takes all the patience and strength of 
the worker. The iron should be, as the phrase goes, " red-hot,'* and the* 
danger of scorching the goods averted by keeping an old wet linen cloth 
between the garment and the iron. Later, a finishing smooth may be 
given with a cooler iron, through a thin dry cloth, to take out the wrinkles 
tometimes caused by the wetting. 

It is a grreat mistake to suppose that when a boy's garment is made 
from the cast-off one of a man it is not worth while to take much trouble 
with it, for the cloth is generally of a better quality than that commonly 

Surchased for boys, and the worn portions can all be cut away by care in 
isposing the pattern. 

Before appropriating castoff coats or pantaloons of the father's to re- 
plenish the boys' wardrobes, the garments should be brushed well and 
ripped up; then washed through two suds made with warm water and 
very strong soap. For reliable colors, a little lye can be added to the first 
water. Do not twist, but stretch and pull the cloth, and fold up each 
piece tightly, and squeeze out the water by pressure, or put it carefully 
through a wringing-machine. Rinse again tlirough two waters, with a little 
soap in the first, and press out the water as before. After all has been 
squeezed out that can oe, hang the cloth in the air over a line, and when 
perfectly dry roll very tightly in a damp towel, and leave for several hours, 
or till the next day; then iron on the right side, through thin muslin, 
running the iron over till the cloth is entirely drv. If there are any 
prominent grease spots on the garment it is best, before washing, to re- 
move them with turpentine, potter's clay, or benzine. Stains can be treated 
(though not always with success) with a mixture of ammonia, camphor, 
and water. For example — say that a jacket is to be cut from a sack coat; 



DRESS MAKING AT HOME. G17 

haying washed the former as directed, select the simplest jacket pattern 
and lay each piece upon the cloth in a position to make the fronts oui 
of the freshest parts. If the wrong side of the cloth is best worthy to be 
uppermost, that should have been pressed instead of the outside when it 
was washed. Sometimes the sleeves of gentlemen's coats are made in one 
piece, with but one seam, and that upon the outside. Such sleeves can 
often be used for the back of a jacket, while the original backs and parts 
of the skirt can be used for side pieces and sleeves of the jacket. In tail- 
oring work it is necessary to maintain a rigid adherence to the pattern. 
Where two pieces are to be joiped, and one is longer than the other, it 
will never do to snip off the extra length, as some careless people do, but 
the longest side must be held in in sewing till the extra fullness is taken 
up. 

In putting the collar on the jacket, care must be observed not to stretch 
or pull it out of shape ; it should also be held full enough to turn over 
easily, and the seam should be pressed in the manner mentioned above. 
If possible, a jacket that has been made by a tailor should be made the 
model for imitation in making one at home, and, till experience has made 
the details familiar, it should be referred to in putting m pockets, setting 
In sleeves, and at every step of the way. 

Small pantaloons are readily cut from larger ones, and even where the 
latter are seriously impaired, it is still possible to make good new ones out 
of them. If the back is in holes, the thin part can be replaced by long 
BoreHsrhaped pieces, such as are seen in army pantaloons, ana a pattern for 
Boys, called sometimes called the "cadet pants," can be procured, if such 
a device is needful. In cutting the fronts, try not to have the exact spot 
come at the k^ee that came there before, but have it above o^ below, as it 
will not 'only wear out faster, but bulge out in an unsightly fashion. If 
the cloth is tnin and looselv woven, or has had already a great deal of wear, 
It will be well to line the little pantaloons throughout. The fly should be 
lined with strong drilling interlined with canvas to give suQcient sup- 
port for the button-holes. Short knee-breeches are much easier to make 
than long ones, and take such a small .quantity of material that two 
pairs can be cut from one pair of ordinary-sized men's pants; but of 
course, after a certain age, all the king's horses and all the kind's men 
would be a force insufficient to compel a little boy to give up his inalien- 
able right to have his trousers as long as his father's ; and happy the mother 
whose young son does not insist on spring bottoms, for that is a touch very 
difficult of attainment to any but an expert. In ordering a pantaloon pat- 
tern, it is less important to give the age of the boy than the length of hia 
leg (measured upon the outside seam), as height varies much in similar 
ages. 

The Ulster is a form to be recommended for the overcoat, where new 
cloth is used, because it is so long and lar^e that the material can be made 
into other garments when its original form is outgrown. 

ELDERLY LADIES. 

Young people sometimes feel that it makes very little difference how 
mothers and grandmothers dress as long as they themselves can make as 
fair a show as the family circumstances allow — a mistake which is unjust 
and prejudicial to all parties. It is a disgraceful, and in a great measure, 
a purely American notion, happily banished now from large cities, but still 
hanging about the country, that a young lady, even if her parents are not 
rich, must be gaily, and as far as possible, richly clothed, and be able to 
show soft jeweled hands, as white as the piano keys she touches deftly or 
otherwise, as the case may be, while mamma spends her overworked time 
in the meanest of clothes, and by reason of shabbiness is seldom seen by 
her daughter's friends, or by any one else except at church. Too often it u

conscience rather than choice that takes her there, where the comfort of 
the service is swallowed in the consciousness of tlie atter forlomneas and 
awkwardness of her appearance in obsolete dress and antiquated mantilla 
that were bought long before the daughters grew up to monopolize what 
little comfort and luxury life in narrow circumstances can give. The 
mother who allows herself to be set aside in this way, and brings up her 
daughters to feel tiiat hers is the secondary place to theirs, fails dismally 
in her duty to them and reaps her reward in the want of respect rendered to 
her. But if the mother of a famil v is herself to blame for the want of nicety 
in her dress, the same can not always be said of the grandmother, whose 
failing strength takes her iwirtially out of the active cares of life, and 
»vlio ought to be the object of tender consideration from every one in the 
iiousehold; and it should be every one's care to have her comfortable and 
'well-dressed — an object of pride, a sort of show-piece, instead of a poor, 
pushed-aside, forlorn object, lo be kept out of sight. Some clever writer 
says that a highly-presentable and well-appointed grandmother in a family 
is a patent of re8|)ectability. 

There is no arbitrary dictum requiring certain things, but custom restricta 
them to a narrow choice of coior — brown, purple, black, and gi*ay being the 
only ones allowed. Artistically considered, brown should be also excluded, 
on account of its unbecomingncss to the dull tints of hair, eyes, and com- 
plexion. The ideal dress for an old lady — and one may as well know what 
the ideal is, even if there is but small hope of investing it In the real—' 
is severely nlain velvet, with soft tulle handkerchief K>lded across the 
breast, rich lace ruffles at the wrist to shade the withered hands, and a 
decorous cap, which makes no attempt to be a head-dress, hut has protect- 
ing strings of lace or ribbon to tie loosely under the chin. We can not 
all dress our dear old grandmothers thus grandly and picturesquely, but 
we can make them' comfortable, and fashion their clothes as tastefully as 
our means will allow, remembering that the love of pretty things to wear 
begins with a woman's life and generallv lasts as long as she does — perhaps 
she is never too old to be gfratined with a pretty cap or dress. 

A black silk dress is not always a possible thing for an old lady, but if, 
by any economy the purchase can be made, it is a wise one, for it will last 
any length of time as a best dress, and be such a comfort to the owner as 
to repay any sacrifice incurred when it was bought. It should be made 
very plainly. If the lady is very stout, and likes the style, it can be made 
a close-fitting Gabrielle or princesse, but the usual style is preferable. 
The waist should fit comfortably, and, unless the wearer has delicate lungs, 
may be cut with the neck open down to the waist, and filled in with a 
lace or lawn handkerchief. An over-skirt is not too youthful, if it is not 
long and entirely unlooped, but many old ladies prefer single-skirted 
dresses. In that case the breadths are but liltle gored; the one in front 
may be shaped like an apron, and the others left straight and sewed upon 
the waistband in lai^ ])laits, except right in the center of the back, where 
they may be shirred for a short aistance, to the depth of an inch or two. 
"le bottom of the dress may be left plain, or may be bound with velvet 
1 I stead of the usual braid, or may be trimmed with one or more wide 
flat bands or folds of the silk. The sleeves mav be trimmed at the hand 
to correspond with the finish on the skirt ; and if the waist is not open 
as suggested, a small square collar trimmed in the same way can be added. 
If circumstances do not allow the silk, black cashmere is certainly the 
next choice, and will be verv handsome made up in the same way. It 
can be made to look richer by edging the folds and bias pieces with mil- 
liner's folds or narrow pipings of silk. Failing the cashmere, black alpaca 
of the best quality that can be afforded is the best substitute. Silk pipings 
are not so pretty upon this material, but their place may be taken by 
galloon, or the skirt may be set off by two groups, three or four in each, 
of narrow double folds of filpaca. 



DRESS MAKING AT HOME. 619 

» 

A comfortable and welcome fashion for old ladies, which was i)erhap9 
suggested by the rage for iichus of all kinds, is a shoulder cape, in shape 
like a Son tag, except that the fronts fasten like a dress with buttons, in- 
stead of being crossed. This is made of black silk, quilted in tiny diamonds 
over a single thickness of wadding, and edged with a double cord, or with 
a very narrow black lace plaited on. ' It can be worn with any dress, and is 
becoming so much adopted by old ladies in the East that they frequently 
have cloth or crocheted capes of the same shape made to wear in change 
with the more dressy one. 

Circulars are frequently mentioned in fashion journals as being well 
adapted to old ladies, but they are really far from being the best shape for 
their wraps, as, having no sleeves, they drag heavily from the neck, and be- 
come very tiresome. A better style is a loose-fitting double-breastea sacque, 
rather long, but not enough so to be heavy and burdensome. 

Ca^is and bonnets are delicate points, and the old lady whose means are 
too straightened to allow her to call {professional skill to her aid (and even 
that is not always equal to the situation) is fortunate if she has a friendly 
relative with taste and capacity enough to undertake the critical task, 
which, to be successful, should be really a labor of love. The caps should 
be pure white, and th'fe bonnets black. A well-defined border or ruche of 
white is pretty and becoming, but an indefinite mingling of black and white 
in either cap or bonnet is unbecoming. Small bonnets are out of the 
question for old ladies who need a shape that will amply protect the head, 
and even the back of the neck, where so many nerves center that embrace 
the slightest opportunity of exposure to ache remorselessly. Still the bonnet 
roust not be too large, unless to shade a lai^e fat face; a small head and 
delicate features in a great coal-scuttle of a hat look like a caricature, and 
the beauty of a bonnet lies in its fitness. 

They say there are no old women in modern tiines,^so it would not be 
safe to mention an age to which the plainness of attire advocated in this 
article belongs. But it was designed for those who honestly feel themselvee 
beyond the period when

COLORING AND BLEAOHING. 

In coloring always use plenty of water (soft water when obtainable) ; never 
crowd the goods, taking care that they float in the liquid. The rule is four 
gallons of water to one pound of goods. In rinsing alwajrs use plenty of clear 
water ; and in preparing goods for coloring, clean off all dirt and grease 
spots. To test color of dye, pour it from a dish held high, and look through 
it to the light A pound of extract of logwood is equal to four pounds of 
logwood chips. Fustic should be boiled in a sack of open texture. The 
other ingredients are put into the water. All black goods should be washed 
in soap-suds after coloring. Let every implement used about coloring be 
scrupulously clean. In preparing the goods, scour well with soap and water, 
washing the soap well out and dipping in warm water before placing in the 
dye. All goods should be well aired, rinsed, and hung out carefully after 
dyeing. Silks and delicate fabrics must be handled tenderly,- or injury will 
be done. In case a very large quantity of goods are to be dyed, a slightly 
smaller proportion of water than the rule above given may be used. 

The "Family Dyes," lately introduced and now kept for sale by all drug- 
gists, are very convenient and give good results. They are aniline dyes, 
and come in the form of a powder, put up in papers, and labeled with full 
Instructions for using. The preparations for using these dyes are very 
simple, and no experience is required if the instructions are implicitly fol- 
lowed. The color card shows the exact shade of the color you select, and 
there is no trouble in experimenting to get the right shade. Besides, the 
dyes are cheap and the results are equal to those produced by the profes* 
sional dyer. There are several manufacturers of aniline dyes, and inquiry at 
the nearest drug store will secure all the information as to prices, colors, etc. 
that may be desired by any lady. 

Color between Pubplb and Blub fob Wool ob Silk.— For four pounds 
of goods, take bichromate of potash one ounce, and alum one and a quarter 
ounces ; dissolve and bring water to boiling point ; put in goods and boil 
one hour ; then empty dve and make new with one pound logwood (or one- 
fourth pound extract of logwood), and boll goods in this one hour longer. 
Use more logwood to make color darker, or less to make it lighter. 

Blb.\ch for Wool, Silk, or Straw. — Mix one pound oxalic acid, one 
pound table salt, and twelve gallons water ; lay goods in this mixture for 
one hour; remove and thoroughly rinse and work. 

Scarlet fob Wool. — For ten pounds flannel or yarn, take two and a half 
pounds of ground lac dye. one and a half pounds scarlet spirit (see recipeX 
naif pound tartar, one and one-fifth ounces flavine (or according to shade 
(620) 



COLORINO AND BLEACHING, 621 

desired), one and a fifth ounces tin crystals, half pound muriatic acid. Bbil 
all together for fifteen minutes ; cool to 170° Fan. ; put in goods, handling 
quickry^ at first, then boil one hour, rinse while hot, before gum and im- 
purities harden. A miaU Quantity of sulphuric acid may be added to tliia 
recipe, to dissolve gum. Ihis scarlet stands soap better than cochineal. 

Scarlet Spirit. — Two pounds muriatic acid (22° B.), two ounces feathered 
tin, and one-fourth pound water. Place acid in a stoneware jar, add the tin, 
let it dissolve, and keep a few days before using. The tin is feathered by 
melting it ana i)ouriiig it from a heiglit of five or six feet into a pailful of 
water. This spirit is used in certain colors, particularly scarlets, orange, and 
pink. 

Cochineal Scarlet. — For five pounds of wool, yarn, or cloth, take two 
ounces cream' tartar, one and a fourth ounces of pulverized cochineal, (»ne 

gound scarlet spirit; boil. the dye; dip the goods, working them well for 
fteen minutes; then boil one and a half hours, slowly stirring the goods all 
the while ; take out, wash in clear water, and drv in doors or in the shade. 

Purple Dye. — For ten pounds of goods, use alum twelve ounces, muriate 
of tin one teacupful, pulverized cochineal two ounces, cream of tartar eight 
ounces. Boil the alum, tin, and cream of tartar for twenty minutes ; add 
the cochineal, and boil five minutes; inmierse the goods two hours ; remove 
and enter them in a new dye composed of Brazil wood twelve pounds, log- 
wood two pounds, alum one pounu, muriate of tin two cupsful, adding a 
little extract of indigo, made as follows : 

Extract of Indigo. — Take oil of vitriol two pounds, and stir into it finely, 
pulverized indigo eight ounces, stirring briskly for the first half-hour, then 
cover it up, and stir fouV or five times daily for a few days; then add a 
little pulverized chalk, stirring it up, and keep adding it as long as it foams. 
It will neutralize the acid. Keep it closely corked. 

Light Silver Drab. — For ten pounds of goods, use logwood two ounces, 
aluUi about the same quantity ; boil well, enter tlie goods, and dip them 
for one hour. Grade the color to any desired shade by using equal parts 
of logwood and alum. 

Chrome Black for Wool. — For ten pounds of goods, use blue vitriol 
twelve ounces ; boil it a short time, then dip the wool or fabric three- 
quarters of an hour, airing frequently ; take out goods, and make a dye with 
logwood six pounds ; boil half an hour, dip three quarters of an hour ; air 
the goods, and dip quarter of an hour longer ; wash in strong soap suds. A 
good fast color. 

Dark Snuff Brown on Wool. — For ten pounds of goods, take camwood 
two pounds; boil for twenty minutes then dip the goods for three-quarters 
of an hour; then take tbem out, and add to the dye fustic five pounds: 
boil twelve minutes, and dip the goods three-quarters of an hour; tiien add 
blue vitriol two ounces, copperas eight ounces; dip again forty minntes; 
add more copperas, if the shade is required darker. 

Wine Color Dye. — For ten pounds of goods, use camwood two pounds ; 
boi> twenty minutes; dip the goods half an hour; boil again, and aip fortv 
minutes ; then darken with blue vitriol three ounces; and should ,you wish 
It darker, add one pound of copperas. 

Pink Dye for Wool. — For ten pounds of goods, take alum one pound ; 
boil, and immerse the goods fifty minutes ; then add to the dye cochineal 
well pulverized three ounces, cream of tartar twelve ounces ; boil, and enter 
the goods while boiling, until the color is satisfactory. 

Oranoe Dye. — For ten pounds of goods, use areal ten ounces, muriate of 
tin two gills ; boil, and dip one hour ; then aad to the dye, fustic five 
pounds, madder one pint, and dip again forty minutes. If preferred, cochi« 
neal four ounces may be used instead of the madder, as a better color is 
induced by it. 

8kt Blue on Cotton. — ^Ten pounds of poods, blue vitriol one pound ! 
boil a short time, then enter tne goods, dip three hours^ and transfer to a 



622 COLORISG AND BLEACHING, 

bath of strong lime water. A fine broum color will be imparted to the 
goods if they are then put through a solution of prussiate of potash. 

A Brown Dyb on Wool may be induced by a dec(x:tion of whitd oak 
bark, with variety of shade accorc^ng to the quantity employed. If the 
goods be first passed through a solution of alum the color will be brightened. 

Brown on Cotton. — Catecheu, or terra japonica, gives cotton a brown color, 
blue vitriol turns it on the fmmze, green copperas dcurken* it, when applied as 
a mordant and the stuff boiled in tne bath boiling hot. Acetate of alumina, 
as a mordant, brightens it. The French color namcil '^ CarmeliU** is given 
with catechu one pound, verdigris four ounces, and sal ammoniac five 
ounceis. 

Brown on Wool and »Silk. — Infusion or decoction of walnut-peels dyes 
wool and silk brown color, which is briglit«ned by alum. Horse chestnut 
peels also impart a brown color ; a mordant of muriate of tin turns it on 
the bronze ; and sugar of lead the reddish-brown. 

SoLiTAiRB. — Sul[>iiate or muriate of manganese, dissolved in water w^ith a 
little tartaric acid, imparts this l)eautiful bronze tint. The stuff after being 
put througii tlu* solution must be turned through a weak lye of potash, ana 
afterward through another of chloride of lime, to brighten and fix it. Prua- 
state of copper gives a bron::e or yelhwhh-brown color to silk. The piece well- 
mordanted with blue vitriol imiy be passed through a solution o( pnissiaU 
of potash. 

Fuller's Purifier for C'I/OTHs. — Dry, pulverize, and sift the following in- 
gredients: Fuller's earth six pounds, French chalk four ounces, pipeclay one 
pound; make into a paste with rectified oil of turpentine one ounce, alcohol 
two ounces, melted oil soap one and a half pounds. Make up the mixture 
into cakes of any desired size, keeping them in water or small wooden boxes. 
A less quantity can be made by using same proportions. 

Grbrn on Cotton. — For ten pounds of goods, use fustic two and a half 
pounds, blue vitriol two and a half ounces, soft soap one pint, and logwood 
chips four ounces. Soak the logwood over night in a brass vessel ; put it 
on the fire in the morning, adding the other ingredients. When quite hot 
it is ready for dyeing; enter the goods at once, and handle well. Different 
shades may be obtained by letting part of the goods remain longer in the 
dye. 

Pink Dye for Cotton. — For ten pounds of goods, use redwood one pound, 
muriate of tin half a pound ; boil the redwood one hour, turn off into a 
large vessel, add the muriate of tin, and put in the goods ; let it stand a few 
minutes (five or ten), and a nice pink will be produced. It is quite a fast 
color. 

Yellow on Silk. — For ten pounds goods, use sugar of lead seven and a 
half ounces, alum two pounds ; enter the goods, and let them remain twelve 
hours; remove them, drain, and make a new dye with fustic one pounds. 
Immerse until the color suits. 

Red Dye for Wool. — For ten pounds of goods, make a tolerably thick 
l)aste of lac dye and sulphuric acid, and allow it to stand for a day. Now 
take tartar one pound, tin liquor half a pound, and twelve ounces of the 
above paste ; make a hot bath with sufficient water, and enter the goods for 
three-quarters of an hour ; afterwards carefully rinse and dry. 

Yellow on Cotton. — For ten pounds goods, use sugar of lead one pound, 
dip the goods two hours. Make a new dye with bichromate of potash half a 
pound; dip until the color suits; wring out and dry ; if not yellow enough, 
repeat the operation. 

Violet Dye on Silk or Wool. — A good violet dye may be given by pass- 
ing the goods first through a solution of verdigris, then through a decoction 
of logwood, and lastly alum water. Xfast violet may be given by dyeing the 
goods crimson with cochineal, without alum or tartar, and, after rinsing, 
passing them through the indigo vat. Linens' or aottons are first galled with 
eighteen per cent, of gall nuts ; next passed through a mordant of alum, 



COLOHINQ ASD BLEACHING. 623 

iron liquor, and sulphate of copper, working them well ; then worked in a 
madder hath made with an equal weight of root ; and lastly brightened with 
soap pr soda. 

Slat£ Dye on Silk.— For a small quantit3% take a pan of warm water and 
about a teacupful of logwood liquor, pretty strong, and a piece of pearl ash 
the size of a nut; take gray colored goods and handle a little in this liquid, 
and it is finished. If too nmch logwood is used, the color will be too dark! 
For a straw color on silk, use swart weed ; boil in a brass vessel, and set with 
alum. 

L1L.VC Dye on Silk.— For five pounds of silk, use archil seven and a halt 
pound.s ; mix it well with the liquor; make it ooil quarter of an hour; <])[> 
the 8ilk quickly, then let it cool, and wash it in river water, and a fine haii- 
violet, or lilac, more or less full, will be obtained. 

GiiEEN Dye on Silk. — Take green ebony, boil it in water, and let it settle; 
take tlie clear liquor, as hot as you can bear your hands in it, and handle 
your goods in it until of a bright yellow ; then take water and put in a little 
sulphate of indipo ; handle your goods in this till of the shade desired. The 
ebony may previously be boiled in a bag to prevent it sticking to the silk. 

Brown on Silk. — ^Diss^lve annatto one pound, pearl ash four pounds, in 
boiling water, and uass the silk through it for two hours; then take it out, 
squeeze it well ana dry; next give it a mordant of alum, and pass it first 
through a bath of Brazil-wood, and afterward through a bath of logwood to 
which a little ^en copperas has been added ; wring it out and dry ; after- 
ward rinse well. 

Mulberry on Silk. — For five pounds of silk, use alum one poun^ and a 
quarter; dip fifty minutes; wash out, and make a dye with Brazil-wood five 
ouncesand logwood one and a quarter ounces, by boiling together; dip in this 
half an hour ; then add more Brazil-wood and logwood, equal parts, until 
the color suits. 

Grken Dye on Wool and Silk. — Equal quantities of yellow oak and 
hickory bark; make a strong yellow bath by ooiling; shade to the desired 
tint, by adding a small quantity of extract of indigo. 

Orange Dye. — For ten pounds of goods, use sugar of lead half a pound ; 
boil fifteen minutes ; when a little cool, enter tlie goods, and dip lor two 
hours ; wring them out, make a fresh dye with bichromate of potash one 
pound, madder quarter of a pound ; immerse until of the desired color. The 
shade may be varied bv dipping in lime-water. 

Blue on Cotton. — i\)r ten pounds of ^oods, use copperas half a pound ; 
boil, and dip twenty minutes; then dip m soap-suds, and return to the dye 
three or four times; then make a new bath with prussiate of potash two 
ounces, oil of vitriol one- third of a pint ; boil half an hour ; rinse out and 
dry. 

Solverino and Magenta Dyes on White Woolen, Silk, or Cotton and 
Woolen Mixtures. — For one pound of woolen goods, Magenta shade, ninetv- 
six grains, a|»othecarie.s' weight, of aniline red will be required ; dissolve In 
a little warm alculiol, u.sing — say — six fluid ounces of alcohol, or about six 
p:ills alcohol, per ounce of aniline. Many dj'ers use wood spirit, because of 
its cheapness. For a Solferino shade use sixty-four grains aniline red, dis- 
solved in four ounces alcohol, to each pound of goods. Cold water, one 
quart, will dissolve these small quantities of aniline red, but the cleanest and 
quickest way will be found by using the alcohol or wood spirit. Clean the 
cloth and goods by steeping, at a gentle heat, in weak soap suds; rinse in 
several messes of clean water, and lay aside moist. The alcoholic solution 
of aniline is to be added from time to time to the warm or hot dye bath, till 
the color on the goods is of the desired shade. The goods are to be removed 
from the dye bath before each addition of the alcoholic solution, and the 
bath is t<) be well stirred before the goods arc returned. The alcoholic solu- 
tion should be first dropped into a little water, and well mixed, and the 
mixture should then be strained into the dye batn. If the color is not dark 



624 COLORING AND BLEACHJNQ 

enough after workins frum twenty to thirty minutes, repeat the .removal of 
the goods from the oath and the addition of the solution, and the re-im- 
mersion of the goods from fifteen to thirty minutes more, or until suited ; 
then remove from the bath and rinse in several messes of clean water, and 
dry in the shade. Use about four gallons water for dye bath for one pound 
of goods ; less water for larger quantities. 

LiQxnD Dye Colors. — 1. Blue. — Dilute Saxon blue, or sulphate of indigo, 
with water. If required for delicate work, neutralize with chalk.* 2. Purple. 
— Add a little alum to a strained decoction of logwood. .3. Green. — ^Dissolve 
sap green in water, and add a little alum. 4. Yellow. — Dissolve annatto in a 
weak lye of subcarbonate of soda, or potash. 5. Golden cotor.^5teep French 
l)orries in hot water, strain, and add a little gum and alum. 6. Red. — Dis- 
solve carmine in ammonia, or in weak carbonate of potash water; or infuse 
powdered cochineal in water, strain, and add a little gum in water. The 
preceding colors, thickened with a little gum, may be used as inks in writing, 
or as colors to tint maps, foils, artificial tlowers, etc., or to paint on velvet. 

To Cleanse Wool. — Make a hot bath composed of water four parts, urine 
one part; enter the wool, opening it out toadmit the full action otthe liquid ; 
after twenty minutes' immersion, remove from the liquid, and allow it to 
drain; then rinse it in clean running water, and spread out to dry. The 
liquid is good for subsequent operations ; only keep up the propertions, and 
use no soap. 

Violet Dye on Straw Bonnets. — Take alum four pounds, tartaric acid 
one pound, chloride of tin one pound. Dissolve and boil; allow the hats to 
remain in the boiling solution two hours; then add as much of a decoction 
of logwood and carmine of indigo as is requisite to induce the desired shade ; 
and lastly, rinse finally in w^ater in which some alum has been dissolved. 

SiLVEB*^ Gray Dye on Straw. — For five hats — select the whitest hats, and 
soften them in a bath of crystallized soda, to which some clean lime water 
has been added, (See ** Lime water.^') Boil for two hours, in a large vessel, 
using for bath a decoction of the following, viz. : alum one pound, tartaric 
acid one-tenth of a pound, some ammoniacal cochineal, and carmine of in- 
digo ; a little sulphuric acid may be necessary in order to neutralize the 
alkali of the cochineal dye. If the last^mentioned ingredients are used, let 
tlie hats remain- for an hour longer in the boiling bath, then rinse in slightly 
acidulated water. 

Lime Water for Dyers' Use. — Put stone lime one pound, and strong lime- 
water one and a half pounds, into a pail of water; rummage well for seven 
or eight minutes; then let it rest until the lime is precipitated and the water 
clear; add this quantity to a tubful of clear water. 

Aniline Green on Silk. — Iodine green, or night green, dissolves easilv in 
warm water. For a liquid dye, one pound may be dissolved in one gallon 
alcohol, and mixed with two gallons water containing one ounce sulphuric 
acid. 

To Dye Aniline Scarlet. — ^For every ten pounds of goods dissolve half 
a pound white vitriol (sulphate of zinc), at 180® Fall. ; place the goods into 
tins bath for ten minutes; then add the color, prepared by boiling for a few 
minutes, quarter of a pound aniline scarlet in tnree-quarters of a gallon 
water, stirring the same continually. This solution has to be filtered before 
being added to the bath. The goods remain in the latter for fifteen minutes, 
when they have become browned, and must be boiled for another half hour 
in the same bath after the addition of sal-ammoniac. The more of this is 
added the deeper will be the shade. 

Bismarck Brown for Dyeing. — Mix together one pound Bismarck, five 

Sallons water, and three-quarters of a pound sulphuric acid. This paste 
issolves easily in hot water, and may be used directly for dyeing. A liquid 
dye may be prepared by making the oulk of the above mixture to two gal- 
lons, wfth afcohol. To dye with the above mixture, sour with sulphurio 
acid ; add a quantity of sulphate of soda, immerse the wool, and aad the 



COLORING AND BLEACHING. 625 

color by small portions, keeping the temperature under 212** Fah. Very in- 
teresting shades may be developed by combining the color with indigo paste 
or picric acid. 

To Dye Wool with Aniune Green. — For wool, prepare two baths— one 
containing the dissolved dye and a quantity of carbonate of soda or borax. 
In this the wool is placed, and the temperature is raised to 212^ Fah. A 

f ravish green is produced, which must be Drightened and fixed in a second 
ath of water 100^ Fah., to which some acetic acid has been added. Cotton 
requires preparation by sumac. 

Aniline Blub. — To ten pounds of fabric, dissolve two ounces aniline blue 
in three-tenths of a quart hot alcohol ; strain through a filter, and add it to 
a bath of 130° Fah. ; also one pound glauber stilts, and half a pound acetic 
acid : enter the goods, and handle them well for twenty minutes ; next heat 
it slowly to 200° Fah. ; then add half a pound sulphuric acid diluted with 
water ; let the whole boil twenty minutes longer ; then rinse and dry. If the 
aniline be added in two or three proportions during the process of coloring, 
it will facilitate the evenness of the color. 

Aniline Bed. — Inclose the aniline in a small muslin bag; have a kettle 
<tin or brass) tilled with moderately hot water, and rub the substance out; 
tlien immerse the goods to be colored, and in a short time they are done. It 
improves the color to wring the goods out of strong soap-suds before putting 
them in the dye. This is a permanent color on wool or silk. 

Aniline Violet and Purple. — Acidulate the bath by sulphuric acid, or 
use sulphate of soda— both those substances render the shade bluish. Dye 
at 212° Fah. To give a fair middle shade to ten pounds of wool, a quantity 
of solution equal to one-half to three-quarters of an ounce of the solid dye 
will be required. The color of the dyed fabric is improved by washing in 
soap and water, and then passing through a bath soured by sulphuric acid. 

Aniline Black for Dyking.— Water twenty to thirty parts, chlorate of 
potassa one part^ sal-ammoniac one part, chloride of copper one part, aniline 
hydrochloric acid one part, previously mixed together. It is essential that 
the preparation should be acid, and the more acid it is the more rapid will 
be the production of the blacks; if too much so, it may injure the fabric 

Aniline Brown Dye. — Dissolve one pound of the browni in two gallons 
of spirit, specific gravity 8200 ; add a sufficient quantity to the dye bath, and 
immerse the fabric. Wool possesses a very strong affinity foi this color, and 
no mordant is required. 

To Bleach Feat hkrs.— Place the feathers from three to four hours in 
a tepid dilute solution of bichromate of potassa, to which, cautiously, some 
nitric acid has been added (a small quantity only). To remove a greenish 
bue induced by this solution, place them in a dilute solution of sulphuric 
acid, in water, whereby the feathers become perfectly white and bleached. 

To Clean Straw Bonnets. — First brush tnem with soap and water, then 
with a solution of oxalic acid. 

Crimson for Silk. — For one pound of silk, alum three ounces; dip, at 
hand-heat, one hour; take out, and drain, while making a new dye, by 
boiling ten minutes, c<ichineal three ounces, bruised gall-puts two ounces, 
and cream of tartar half an ounce, in one pail of water; when a little cool, 
beKin to dip, raising the heat to a boil, continuing to dip one hour; wash 
and dry. 

Cinnamon or Brown on Cotton and Silk.— Give' the goods as much color 
from a solution of blue vitriol (two ouces to water one ^Uon) as it will take 
up in dipping fifteen minutes; then run it through lime-water; this will 
make a beautiful sky-blue of much durability; it has now to be run through 
a solution of prussiate of pota.*«h, one ounce to water one gallon. 

To Color Straw H.\ts or Bonnets a Beautiful Slate.— First soak the 
bonnet in rather stwng warm suds for fifteen minutes, to remove sizing 
or stiffening ; then rinse in warm water, to get out the soap ; now scald cnd- 
he&T one ounce in sufficient water to cover the hat or bonnet; work the

hat or bonnet ki this dye, at 180° of heat, until you get a light-purpLe ; now 
have a bucket of cold water^ blued with the extract of indigo half an ounce, 
and work or stir the bonnet in this until the tint pleases ; dry, then rinse out 
with cold water, and dry aeain in the shade. If you get the purple too deep 
in shade, the final slate will be too dark. 

To Clean Ostrich Feathers. — Cut some white curd soap in small pieces; 
pour boiling water on them, and add a litUe pearl ash. When the soap is 
quite dissolved and the mixture cool enuugh for the hand to bear, phin^ 
tne feathers into it, and draw them tlirough the hand till the dirt ai^iears 
squeezed out of them; pass them tli%>ugh a clean lather with some blue in 
it ; then rinse them in cold water with blue, to give them a good color. 
Beat them against the hand, to siiake off the water, and dry by shaking them 
near a fire. When i>erfectly dry, coil each fiber separately with a blunt knife 
or ivory folder. 

To Clean Furs. — For dark furs, warm a quantity of new bran in a pan, 
taking care that it does not burn, to prevent which it must be briskly stirred. 
When well warmed, rub it thoroughly into the fur with the hand. Repeat 
this two or three times; then shake the fur, and give it another sharp brush- 
ing, until free from dust. For white furs, lay them on a table, and rub well 
with bran made moist with wami water; rub until quit« dry, and afterward 
with dry bran. The wet bran should be put on with flannel; then dry with 
book muslin. Light furs, in addition to the above, sh*ould be well rubbed 
witli magnesia, or a piece of book muslin, after the bran process, against the 
way of the fur. 

(/HIP OR Straw Hats or Bon.vkts may be dyed black by boiling them 
three or four hoars in a strong liquor of logwood, adding a' little copperas 
occasionally. Let the bonnets remain in the liquor all night; then take out 
to dry in the air ; if the black is not satisfactory, dye again after drjing. 
Kub inside and out with a spon^ moistened in fine oil; then block. Red 
Dye. — Boil ground Brazil-wood in a lye of pota.sh, and boil your straw hats, 
etc., in it. Blue Dye. — Take a sufficient quantity of potash lye, one pound 
of litmus, or lacmus, ground ; make a decoction, and then put in the straw, 
and boil it. « 

Method op Bleaching Straw. — Dip the straw in a .solution of oxygenated 
muriatic acid saturated with i)Otash. (Oxygenated muriate of lime is much 
cheaper.) The straw is thus rendered very white, and its flexibility is in- 
crease<i. 

Bleaching Straw Goods. — Straw is bleached by simplv exposing it in a 
closed chamber to the fumes of burning sulphur — an old flour barrel is the 
apparatus most*used for the purpose by milliners, a flat stone being laid on 
the ground, the sulphur ignited thereon, and the barrel, containing the goods 
to be bleached, turned over it. The goods should be previouslj washed hi 
pure water. 

Varnish for Faded Rubber Qoods. — Black Japan vaniish diluted -with a 
little linseed oil. 

To Bleach Linen. — Mix common bleaching powder in the proportion of 
one pound to a gallon of water ; stir it occasionally for three davs ; let it 
settle, and p^jur it off clear Then make a lye of one pound of soda to one 
gallon of boiling soft water, ir which soak the linen for twelve hours, and 
Doil it half an hour. Next soak it in the bleaching lic^uor, made as above; 
and, lastly, wash it in the usual manner. Discolored linen or muslin may 
be restored by putting a portion of bleaching liquor into (he tub wherein 
the articles are soaking. 

Dye for Feathers. — Black — Immerse for two or three days in a bath, at 
first hot, of logwood eight parts, and copperas, or acetate of iron, one part. 
Blue — with the indigo vat Brown — by using any of the brown dyes for silk 
or woolen. Crimson — a mordant of alum, followed by a hot bath of Brazil- 
wood, afterward by a weak dye of cudbear. Pirik or Rose — with safflower or 
lemon juice. Flumr-vfith the red dye, followed by an alkaline bath. Red 



COLORING AND BLEACHING. • 627 

mordant of alum, followed by a bath of Brazil-wood. YeUow — a mordant 
of alum, followed by a bath of turmeric or weld. Oreen Dye — take of verdigris 
and verditer,of each one ounce, gum water one pint; mix them well, and dip 
the feathers, they having been first soaked in hot water, into the said mix- 
ture. For Purple, use lake and indigo. For Carnation, Vermillion and 
smalt. Thin gum or starch water should be used in dyeing feathers. 

Colors for Artificial Flowers. — The French employ velvet, fine cambric, 
And kid for the petals, and talfeta for the leaves. Very recently thin plates 
of bleached whalebone have been used for some portions of the artificial 
flowers. Colors and Stains : — Blue — Incngo, dissolved in oil of vitriol, and 
the acid partly neutralized with salt of tartar or whiting. Green — a solution? 
of distilled verdigris. Lilac — liquid archil. iJ<J(i— carmine dissolved in a 
solution of salt oi tartar, or in spirits of hartshorn. Violet— rliquid archil, 
mixed with a little salt of tartar. Yellow — tincture of turmeric. The colors 
are generally applied with the fingers. 

Black Varnish for Chip and Straw Hats. — Best alcohol four ounces, 
pulverized black sealing-wax one ounce ; ^ut them into a phial, and put the 

Shial into a warm place, stirring or shaking occasionally until the wax is 
isHolved. Apply it, when warm, before the fire or in the sun. This makes 
a beautiful gloss. 

Dyf^ for Furs. — Brown — use tincture "of logwood. lUd — ground Brazil- 
wood half a pound, water one and a half quarts, cochineal half an ounce ; 
boil the Brazil-wood in the water one hour ; strain and add the cochineal ; 
boil fifteen minutes. Scarlet color — boil lialf an ounce saffron in half a 
pint of water, and pass o\^r the work before applying the red. Blue — 
logwood seven ounces, blue vitriol one ounce, water twenty-two ounces; 
boil. Purpfc— logwood eleven ounces, alum six ounces, water twenty-nine 
ounces. Green — strong vinegar one and a half pints, best verdigris twa 
ounces (ground fine), sap green one-quarter of an ounce ; mix all together, 
and beil. 

To Raise a Nap on Cioth, — Clean the article well ; soak it in cold water 
for half an hour ; put it on a board, and rub the thread-bare parts with a 
balf-worn hatter^s card filled with flocks, or with a teazle, or a prickly tbistilir 
\iiitil a nap is raised ; then lay the nap the right way with a hatter's brush, 
and hang up to dry. 

Fine Claret for Wool. — Boil thirteen pounds of goods two hours with 
seven pounds of camwood, one-tenth pound logwood, and one fourth pound 
of copperas to darken. 

Russian Brown for Wool. — For thirteen pounds goods, boil two pounds 
fustic and four pounds camwood an hour, and if too light color, add one- 
tenth pound each copperas and alum to darken. 

Bottlf^oreen for vV ool. — Boil ten pounds wool with one-tenth pound 
chrome and one-fifth pound alum ; take out, put in a vessel of clean water 
tliree pounds fustic and one and a half pounds logwood, and boil another 
hour, 

Bu\CK for Wool. — For twenty-five pounds of goods, boil g(X)ds in a solu- 
tion of five-eights pounds each bichromate potash and blue vitriol, and 
one-half pound argol, one hour; take out, re-fill kettle with clean water, 
and add three pounds dissolved extract of logwood ; i>ut in goods, and 
simmer one hour and a half; take out, rinse, scour with soap, and dry. 
This makes a blue-black. To make a jet-black, add tliree pounds fustio 
with the logwood. 

Blue for Cotton. — Put ten 'po^r^ds cotton, two and a half pounds cop- 
peras, in ti/teen to twenty gallons water, and boil two hours ; after boiling, 
take out, rinse in clear water, re-fill kettle with water, and add one-half 
pound prussiate of potash. Boil goods in this half an hour, lift out goods, 
and slowly add one half pound oil of vitriol; return goods, and boil half an 
hour. Rfnse in clear water, and dry.

628 . COLORING ASD BLEACHING, 

to the blue mixture of the preceding rule, put in goods, and simmer until 
the required shade of green is obtained. 

Chromjb- YELLOW FOR CoTTON.— For fifteen pounds cotton goods or yarns, 
dissolve eight ounces of white sugar of lead in one tub, and eight ounces 
of chrome in another. Put goods first in with sugar of lead, wring out 
ffoods well, and shake bark into the liquid again, repeating tlie operation 
fire times (in onler to make the goods absorb as much color as posaible); 
then put them through the chrome tub in the same wav ; tlien return 
again to the sugar of lead tub ; treat as Xyiiore ; rinse off well, and dry. To 
make a dark shade, use brown sugi^ of lead, repeating three times in the 
sugar of lead and twice in the chrome. 

A Good Black fob Cotton. — To a tub of cold water add, for twenty 
pounds goods, five pounds sumac ; wring and shake out goods, and returii 
to liquid a few times; let stand all niglit in sumac: then to another tub 
of water add a few pails of lime-water; put in goods, wring out, and put 
into another tub of coid water iu which is two pounds of dissolved cop* 
peras and a pailful of old 8umac liquor; wring out six times; wring out* 
and put into the lime-tub again, adding two more pails of lime-water. 
Prepare another tub of water, and adding to it six pounds of logwood and 
one pound of fustic previously scalded ; put in the cotton, and wring out 
and return ten times; lift out, darken liquid with a little copperas, and re- 
turn the goods. The omission of the sumac gives a purplish black, while 
the recipe as above gives a jet black. 

To Dye Blue. — A very beautiful biue may be produced in an hour by the 
following process: " For each pound of material* take two and a half ounces 
of alum and one and a half of cream tartar. Boil them together in a bra^s 
or copper kettle for about an hour. Take sufficient warm water to cover the' 
floods, and color it to the shade you Tiiay desire with chemic blue. Put all 
mto the copper kettle, and boil it a short time, taking care to keep it stirred 
all the time ; remove the cloth, wash in clear cold water, and hang up to 
dry." 

Royal Blub fob Silk.— Take ten pounds of silk, make up a tub of nitrate 
of iron at six decrees, to which add one pint of good muriate of tin and four 
ounces of tartaric acid ; wring out and return, repeating for about an hour; 
in another tub, add one and a half ;)ounds of dissolved prussiate and one 
gill of oil of vitriol. Wash goods out of iron tub, and put into prussiate 
tub ; repeat in iron twice and once in prussiate ; wash out of the iron, and 
put in a tub in which oil of vitriol, until it tastes sour, has been dissolved; 
jrive six wrings to clear of any rust that may adhere to it. More prussiate 
will produce a darker, and a less a lighter color, but the same quantity of 
iron and tin must be used. 

Yellow-bbown for Woolen YABN.—For ten bunches, dye with tw^o 
pounds of camwood, five pounds fustic, and one each of logwood and cop- 
peras. 

ScABLET FOB Woolen Yabn.— Boil eight pounds yarn one hour with one-

half hours with ten pounds of alum, two pounds of argol, and one-fourth of 
a quart nitrate of tin; wash well, and finish with seven and a half pounds 
logwood and one pound of peach-wood in a clean vessel. Put in oool in 
fimshmg, and heat to boiling-point 



MEDICAL. 



When people fall 9ick they seem to lose what little common sense they 
poesessed when well. Men and women who are reasonably wise aiKl rea- 
sonable in other matters, cherish the most absurd superstitions, and follow 
the advice of the most transparent quacks when it comes to disease and 
medicine. A little reflection will convince any reasonable person that no 
single medicine will cure all diseases, indeed no medicine will cure the 
same disease in different persons, and in different stages. Any candid 
physician will admit that the use of medicines by the most skillful and ex- 
perienced practitioner, is, to a great extent, an experiment. What is "one 
man's meat is another*8 poison,'* and even the best physician needs to know 
the constitution of the patient, and to study the symptoms of disease before 
he can prescribe safely, to say nothixu; of curing the disease. And yet 
there are intelligent men and women who buy patent nostrums, and pour 
them down their throats, knowing nothing of the disease, or of the prob- 
able effect of the alleged remedy. For instance, a child has a cough and a 
** cough remedy" is purchased and dealt out. Now, there are many kinds 
of coughs. The cough may be "dry," or it may be "loose;" the symptoms 
may differ in various ways, and yet the " cough remedy " given for a " dry" 
cough may be intended for a "loose" one, and so all the symptoms may 
be aggravated, perhaps, with a fatal result. The physician's advice and ex- 
perience is chiefly valuable to tell us what the disease is and the best pos- 
sible treatment for it It is dangerous in the extreme to administer any 
powerful remedy, or any medicine the noiure and effect of which are not knotvnf 
without the advice of some one who knows the disease and its probable effect, 
The household medicine chest should contain only simple remedies, the 
effect of which, at worst, can not be very injurious; and in all dangerous 
or violent diseases a physician should be promptly called. 



For Colds, drink hot pennyroyal tea. 

Glycerine is excellent to rub on chafes, bums, or chapped hands or sun 
scalds. 

For Burns.— Lime-water, olive-oil, and glycerine, equal parts; applied 
on lint 

Liniment. — Three ounces each of tincture of opium, camphorated oil, and 
soap liniment. 

For Jaundice. — The yolk of an egg, raw or slightly cooked, is excellent 
food in jaundice. 

For Quinsy, gargle with water as hot as can be borne. This gives great 
relief, even in severe cases. 

Liniment. — The common May-weed blossoms put in alcohol are much 
floperior to arnica for the same use. 

TO Check Vomiting — Give a tea-spoon of whole black mustard seed. A 
table-spoon may be given in severe cases.

ounce of manna; drinking this quantity cool, in small draughts, at intervals 
during the day, is go(xi for consumptives. 

To Prevent Skin from Discoloring after a Bruise. — Apply immedi- 
ately, or as soon as possible, a little dry starch or arrow-root, moistened with 
cold' water, or rub over with common table butter. 

Sick Headache. — Elixir of guarana, prepared by Brewer & Co., Spring-

For Ivy Poisoning.— A simple and effectual remedy for ivy poisoning, is 
said to be sweet spirils of nitre. Buthc the affected parts two or three times 
during the day, and the next morning scarcely any trace of the poison - 
will remain. 

For the Lungs.— A quart (or less if too strong) of tar, stirred six min- 
utes in a gallon of water, and one-fourth, or a tumbler, taken four times a 
day, an hour or two after meals, is said to clear the lungs, and give greater 
ease in public speaking. 

SLEKPLES.<<Ness. — Wet a cloth in cold water, and lay it on the back of the 
neck. Fold a towel smoothly over it, and very often it will soothe the "weary 
brain, and quiet the nerves better than an opiate. It is particularly useful 
in case of a dull headache. 

Bee Stings. — Anv atsorbent will giv^ relief from bee stings, but perhaps 
nothing is more effectual than lean raw meat. The sting of a bee or wasp 
may be almost instantly relieved by it. It is said to cure the bite of a 
rattlesnake, and relieve erysipelas. 

For a Cold. — Cayenne pepper-tea for a cold. Put a quarter of a tea- 
spoon of cayenne pepper in a tea-cup; pour over hot water and sweeten 
with sugar. Or, steep horseradish in a gill of vinegar, add a gill of honey, 
and take a tea-spoon every twenty minutes. 

Paste for Sckap-Books. — Corn-flour makes the best ptiste for scrap-b<x)ks. 
Dissolve a small qiiautity in cold water, then cocjk it thoroughly. Be careful 
not to get it too tliick. When cold, it should be thin enough to apply witU 
a brush. It will not mould or stain the paper. 

Blackened Eye.— Should the eye or any other part be blackened by a fall 
or blow, apply a cloth wrung out of very vvarm water, and renew it until the 
pain ceases. The moLsture and heat liquefy the blood, and send it back to its 
proper channel. Never use cold water to a brui?*.'. 

For Erysipelas. — A simple jwultice made' from cranberries pounded

buttermilk; drink and auply to the parts affected. 

For Sorb Throat. — Take five cents worth of chlorate of potash, dissolve, 
and take a tea-spoon every hour, and also gargle with it. Or, to a tea-cup 
vinegar add salt and cayenne jiepper, making it as strong as can be taken 
(some add a little pulverized alum), and gargle often with it. 

Burns. — Common baking soda — the bicarbonate — has been found to cure 
burns or scalds, affording immediate relief when it is promptly applied. For 
a dry burn, the soda should be made into paste with water. For a scald or 
wet burned surface, the powdered soda (or borax will do as well) should be 
dusted on. 

To Relieve Toothache. — Apply powdered alum, or fill mouth with warm 
water, and immediately after with cold ; or saturate a piece of cotton with 
a strong .solution of ammonia, and apply to the tooth. For toothache and 
inflamed face caused by it, apply a poultice of pounded slippery-elm bark 
and cold water. 

A Good Cure for Colds is to boil two ounces of flaxseed in one quart of 
water; strain and add two ounces of rock candy, one-half pint of honey, 



632 MEDICAL. 

Juice of three lemons; mix, and let all boil well ; let cool, and bottle. Dose 
— One cupful before bed, one-half cupful before meals. The hotter you 
drink it the better. 

Tapb Worms are said to be removed by refraining from supper and break- 
fast, and at eight o*clock taking one-third part of two hundred minoed 
pumpkin seeds, the shells of which have been removed by hot water; at 
nine take another third, at ten the remainder, and follow it at eleven vdth 
strong dose of castor-oil. 

For Cold in the Head. — As soon as you feel that you have a cold in the 
head, put a tea-spoonful of sugar in a goblet, and on it put six drops of cam- 
phor, stir it, and fill the glass half full of water; stir, till the sugar is dis- 
solved, then take a dessert-spoonful every twenty minutes. This is a sure 
cure if taken as directed. 

To Prevent Takincj Cold.— If out in cold weather with insufficient 
clothing or wrappings, fold a newspaper and spread across the chest. Per- 
sons having weak lungs can in this way make for themselves a very cheap 
and perfect lung protector. Large papers spread between quilts at night, 
add much to the warmth. 

Salve. — The following is an excellent salve for burns, cuts, or sores of long 
standing: Take equal parts of melted beeswax, mutton suet, pulverized resin, 
burnt alum, honey, Venice of turpentine, sweet-oil. C<X)k over a slow fire 
all together. Stir till it commences to thicken; then strain through a cloth 
and pour in earthen boxes. 

Catarrh Cold. — ^Ten drops carbolic acid, and seven and a half each of 
iodine and chloroform ; heat a few drops over a spirit lamp in a test tube, 
holding the mouth of the tube to the nostrils as soon a^ volatization is ef- 
fected. Repeat every two minutes, until the patient sneezes a number of 
times, when the troublesoiup symptoms will disappear. 

Neuralgia. — One- half drachm sal-ammonia in one ounce of camphor- 
water. Take a tea-spoon several times, five minu*es apart, until relieved. 
Another simple remedy is horseradish. Grate, and mix it in vinegar, the 
same as for table purposes, and apply to the temple when the face or head 
is affected, or the wrist, when the pain is in the arm or shoulder. 

Whooping Cough. — Mix one lemon sliced, half pint flax-seed, two ounces 
honey, and one quart water, and simmer, not boil, four hours; strain when 
cool, and if there is less than a pint of the mixture, ad<^ water. Dose: 




gives the following: **Once a week invariaWy- 
^enerally when we had cold meat minced — I gave the children a dinner which 
IS hailed with delight, and looked forward to; this is a dish of boiled onions. 
The little things knew that they were taking the best of medicine for expel- 
ling what most children suffer from — worms. Mine were kept free by this 
remedy alone.'* 

Fob Sore Throat use as a remedy one ounce of camphorated oil and 
five cents worth of chlorate of potash. Whenever anj' soreness appears in 
the throat, put the potash in half a tumbler of water, and with it gargle the 
throat thoroughly, then rub the neck thoroughly with the camphorated oil 
at night before going to bed, and also pin around the throat a small strip of 
woolen flannel. 

Eye Wash. — Sulphate of zinc two grains, sulphate of mornhine one-half 
prain, distilled water one ounce ; mix, and bottle. Drop in tne eye (a drop 
or two at once,) then wink the eye several times, so that the wash may reacn 
all the parts; and keep quiet and do not use the eyes for about an hour. 
This wash is for blood-shot eyes, and when used it will produce quite a 
smarting sensation. 

Coxklin's Salve. — One pound of resin, two ounces mutton tallow, one of 
beeswax, one-half gill alcoholic spirits, add a little of the gum of balsam; 
boil all together slowly, until it has done rising or foaming, or until it begins

to appear clear. Pour the mixture into a pail of cold water, and when it 

f others, take it oat, roll on boards and cut it off. Care must be taken not to 
urn it. Moisten the hands in brandy while working. 

Mustard Plaster. — Mix with boiling water, vinegar, or white of an egg 
(the latter is best when a blister is not wanted) to consistency the same as if 
for the table. Some add a little flour when not wanted so strong. Spread 
on half a thin muslin cloth, cover with the other half, or put on cloth, and 
put over it a thin piece of gauze ; apply, and when removed, wash the skin 
with a soft sponge, and apply a little sweet cream or oil. 

Sprains.— -If a sprain is nothing more than a sprain — that is, if no bonea 
are broken or put out — wrap the part in several folds of flannel which has 
been wrung out of hot water, and cover it with a dry bandage, and rest it 
for some days, or even weeks. Entire rest at first, and- moderate rest after- 
ward, are absolutely necessary after a sprain. If it is in the ankle, the foot 
should be raised as nigh as may be comfortable; if in the wrist, it should be 
carried in a sling. 

French Remedy for Consumption. — One-half pound finely cut up fresh 
beefsteak; one drachm pulverized charcoal; four ounces pulverized sugar; 
four ounces rye whisky; one pint boiling water. Mix all together, let it 
stand in a cool place over night, and give from one to two tea-spoons liquid 
and meat before each meal. The dose should be small at first, until the 
stomach becomes used to it, and then gradually increased. This remedy has 
the merit of simplicity. 

Cough Mixture.— Dissolve one-fourth pound gum-arabic in half-pint boil- 
ing water, add a half tea-cup sugar and honey, and two table-spoons lemon 
juice, steep for five or ten minutes; bottle and cork, add water, and take; 
or boil one ounce each of licorice-stick and anise-seed, and half ounce senna 
in one ouart of water, ten minutes; strain, add two tea-cups molasses or 
honey, ooil down to a pint and then bottle ; or, to one pint whisky add 
one-half pound rock candy and two ounces glycerine. 

Drunkenness. — There is a prescription in use in England for the cure of 
drunkenness, by which thousands are said to have been assisted in recovering 
themselves. It is as follows: Sulphate of iron, five grains; peppermint 
water, eleven drachms; spirit of nutmeg, one drachm; twice a day. This 
preparation acts as a stimulant and tonic, and partially supplies the place of 
the accustomed liquor, and prevents that absolute physical and moral pros- 
tration that follows a sudden cessation from the use of stimulating dnnks. 

Catarrh. — ^Wet and cold at the surface of the body is a cause of catarrh, 
but the most fruitful source is wet and cold feet, and yet there is nothing 
more easy to avoid. Warm socks, horse-hair soles, and goloshes will always 
keep the feet dry and warm. It does not seem to be understood that although 
a boot or shoe may not leak, yet if the sole is damp, it by evaporation con- 
ducts away the heat from the foot, and ought never to be worn when not 
exercising. The neck should be covered lightly, but too much covering pre- 
disposes to catarrhal troubles by causing congestion of the membrane anected 
in this disease. Bed-rooms ought to be well aired, and warmed if possible, 
by an open fire, in damp, chilly weather. 

Bllsters for Diphtheria. — The method of treating that form of pul- 
monary consumption which consists in ulceration in the substance of the 
lungs, by means of blisters on the chest, and thus giving an artificial outlet 
to the humors which otherwise dischar^ from the lungs, has been succes-s- 
fully applied to various other diseases in which vital or^ns were attacked. 
Even various forms of internal inflammation may in tlus way be drawn to 
the exterior, and the latest auplication of this method has been made with 
diphtheria. The new method is to blister the chest of the patient suffering 
from diphtheria, and the ulceration which otherwise takes place in the 
throat, will appear on the chest, while the throat becomes free. 

Healixg Salve for Wounds. — Pint olive-oil, half ounce common resin, 
half ounce beeswax ; melt well together, and bring oil to boiling heat ; add

use a tnfle more lead); in a short time after it is taken up by the oil, and 
the mixture l)ecome» brown or w shining black, ruinovc from the fire, and 
when nearly cold add two scruples pulverized cinnplior. It should remain 
on the fire until it attains a pro|)er consistency for spreading, wiiich may be 
known b^^ dipping a splint or knife in the mixture from time to time, and 
allowing it to cool. When used spread thinly on a piece of tissuc-|>aper or 
old, fine linen. Excellent for frost sores or any kind that are hard to heal. 

How TO Distinguish Rashbs. — Measles appear as a number oi dull red 
spots, in many places running into each other, and is usually first seen 
aoout the face and on the forehead, near the roots of the hair, and is often 
precedod by running of the eyes and nose, and all the signs of severe cold. 
Scarlet fever appears first about the neck and chest, but not unfrequeiitly at 
the bend of the elbow or under the knee, and is usually preceded by sore 
throat. It can be distinguished from roseola — a mild disease, which is some- 
times mistaken for it — by the bright red color of the skin, which appears 
not unlike a boiled lobster. In chicken-pox the symptom is attenaw by 
fever, the spots are smaH, separate pimples, and come generally over the 
whole body. 

CuBKB Brrries for Catarrh. — A new remedv for catarrh is crushed cubeb 
berries smoked in a pipe, emitting the smoke through the nose; after a few 
trials this will be easy to do. If the nose is stopped up so that it is almost 
impossible to breathe, one pipeful will make the head as clear as a bell. 
For sore throat, asthma, and bronchitis, swallowing the smoke effects imme- 
diate relief. It is the best remedy in the world for offensive breath, and will 
make the most foul breath pure and sweet. Sufferers from that horrid dis- 
ease, ulcerated catarrh, will find this remedy unequaled, and a month's use 
will cure the most obstinate case. A single trial will convince any one. 
Eating the uncrushed berries is also good for sore throat and all bronchial 
complaints. After smoking, do not expose yourself to cold air for at least 
fifteen minutes. 

Sure Cure for Croup. — Boil pigs' feet in water, without salt, and let it 
stand over night ; in the morning skim off the fat (which will be formed in 
a cake on top), put in a tin pan, boil until all water is evaporated; bottle, 
and keep for use. Give a tea-spoon every fifteen minutes on the appearance 



of the first symptoms, and apply freely to chest and throat, rubbing well.

oil is administered at the first symptoms. Or, warm a tea-spoon w^ith a little

membrane that is forming. Apply lard' or goose grease to throat and chest, 
with raw cotton or flannel. Care' should be taken, removing only a small 
piece at a time of these extra wraps to prevent taking cold. 

For Rheu.matism. ^Internal remedy.) — Three drams iodide of potash, dis- 
solved in one-half pint of hot water. Take a table-spoonful three times a 
day, and drink lemonade at intervals between. 

(External remedy. > Liniment — ^Two ounces tincture arnica, one ounce 
canii)hor, one ounce belladonna, one ounce cannabis indica, one-half onnce 
aconite (if neuralgia), one-half oiince oil hemlock, one-half ounce worm- 
wood, one-half ounce sassafras (if there are humors), one-fourth ounce or- 
iganum, one-fourth ounce tar (if there are sores), one-fourth ounce cajeput, 
one-eighth ounce peppermint, one^fourth ounce chloroform, six ounces aqua 
ammonia. Wet a flannel with this liniment, and rub the parts affected ; or 
place the flannel over the rheumatic part, and cover it with thick paper, and 
place near it a warm brick. Immediate relief will be obtained. 

Cure for Felon. — When a felon first makes its appearancej take the inside 
skin of an egg-shell, and wrap it around the part affected. When the press- 
ure becomes too painful, wet it with water, and keep it on twelve hours. 

Roast or bake /lioroughly a large onion ; mix the soft inner pulp with twc

heaping table-spoons of table salt, and apply the mixture to the affected 
part as a poultice, keeping the parts well covered. Make fresh applications 
at least twice a day, morning and evening, and a cure will follow m at least 
a week. 

Or, one 'tea-spoon of scorched salt, one tea-spoon of corn meal, one tea- 
spoon of scraped hard soap, one tea-spoon of beet leaves pounded up, twelve 
drops of turpentine, and the yolk of one egg. Mix all ingredients toge^he^ 
in tne form of a poultice, in which bind closely the swollen finger. 

Or, procure five or six lemons, cut oflf the end of one, thrust the sore finger 
Into the lemon, and let it stay till the lemoh is warm ; proceed in the same 
way till all the six are used. Or, put a piece of Spanish-fly plaster over tluj 
spot affected, and that will draw tne trouble to the surface ; or, on the first 
appearance, apply a poultice of the common Fleur de Lis root well mashed. 
It will cure in a short time. 

For Constipation. — ^The same remedies will not affect all persons. One 
or two figs eaten fasting is sufficient for some, and they are especially good 
in the case of children, as there is no trouble in getting them to take them. 
A spoon of wheaten bran in a glass of water is a simple remedy and quite 
effective. One or two tumblers of hot water will move almost every one^ 
but is difficult to take. In chronic cases^t faithful manipulation and mov- 
ing of bowels and limbs with gentle rotary movement with the open palm, 
*nd giving all natural motions to the parts, with proper diet, will almost 
invariably secure the desired result. It has been Known to cure a case of 
life-long habit, where inherited, too, and although it involves patience and 
perseverance, it is certainly better than to suffer the ills that result from so 
many patent medicines and ouack nostrums. " An ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure," ana regularity of habit in this matter is the great 
thing to oe impressed on people generally. 

Or, three tea-cups each of coarse, clean wheat-bran and sifted flour, one 
heaping measure each of Horsford*s bread preparation (soda and acid), seven 
teaspoons good butter and one of salt. Mix with cold sweet milk; roll 
third of an inch thick, cut with a biscuit cutter and bake tlioroughly in a 
moderate oven ; or, pour hot water on one table-spoon flax seed, pour off and 
at once add three or four table-spoons of cold water, and drink. This is per- 
fectly harmless and may be taken once, twice, or thrice a day if necessary ; 
or, a teasiwon black mustard-seed taken every morning ; or a glass of cold 
water taken at night and first thing in the morning. 

Scarlet Fever, or Scarlatina.— When to the feeling of general illness 
which accompanies all fevers is added a very rapid pulse, 120-130, and a tem- 
perature of 100®-104°-105°, and there is a dry, hot feeling in the throat, with 
tonsils red and swollen, and distress on trj^ng to swallow, it is jwife to suspect 
an infectious disease, and probably scarlet fever. The sick person shoulu be 
isolated at once in a room as much apart from the other members as possible, 
the higher up in the house the better, and a good" physician sent for. 

The rash generally appears about the second dav, beginning on the neck 
and chest, and extending over the whole bodv, the deepest color being on the 
neck, the outer side of the limbs, the joints, hands ana feet. The cheeks are 
a bright, deep red. The case having been declared to be scarlet fever, all pre- 
cautions given for infectious diseases, as regards isolation and disinfection, 
must be observed. 

The room should be kept at an even temperature of 65°; light a fire, if 
possible, and leave the window down an inch at the top. Throw the window 
open and change the air entirely twice a day, covering the patient head and 
all at the time and until the room is again warm. Do not be afraid uf fresh, 
dry outside air, but be sure that the patient is covered head and all, so tliat 
no cold air is breathed, while you are airing and warming the room. 

Give the patient once or twice daily, a warm sponge or plunge bath, as 
directed by the physician, being careful that he is covered with a blanket 
during the bathnig, thrown over the bed or tub; dry quickly with wario. 



^36 MEDICAL, 

soft towels, and as the patient lies in ]>e(l, rub the entire surface of the bodv 
with vaseline, cocoa-oil, or whatever oil the pliysician orders. The beet- 
clothing should be wanu, but never heavy; keep the feet and legs warm. 

Gruels, milk, simple broth, etc., are generally enough. When there is 
exhaustion from fever, the d(x;tor will give ordei^ as to stimulating nourish-! 
ment. Cold wuter or weak lemonade may be given freely, imless the doctor 
orders differently. 

Keep the patient strictly in bed; make use of the bed-pan and urinal to 
prevent getting up. Guard in every way a check of perspiration. If the 
patient is propped up in bed, see that a sliort jacket or small i^hawl is put 
over the niglit-aress, but use nothing that can not be washed. 

Notice the breathing at night or in sleep, whether it is even and deep, or 
short and labored, as if there were trouble with the air-passages. Be jxir- 
ticularly watchful of the condition of the excretions, especially of the urine; 
should rt become scanty or smoky -colored, report it at once to the physician. 
Observe whether there is a free though seemingly harmless discharge from 
the nose; this may indicate diphtheritic trouble. See whether there is any 
swelling of limbs. In short, there is nothing which must not be observed 
with care, and reported accurately to the doctor. 

The skin becomes dry, and generally begins to scale off about the fith day 
after the rash appears. No patient should be allowed to leave his bed until 
this process is completed. The warm baths should be kept up, the least chilli- 
ness guanled against, and the temperature of the room allowed now to be 70^. 
After the peeling is over the patient should still remain in his r<x)m for two 
weeks, and should be separate from otiier members of the family not less 
than a month from the commencement of the disease. Severe cases of scarlet 
fever may follow from exposure to light ones. See that the patient is well 
wrapped, with hands and feet protecteid, on first going into the open air. 

The troubles wliich may arise out of an attack are frequently the result 
of carelessness on the part of the nurse, neglect of orders, exposure to cold, 
etc. There can not be tf30 much care taken of the lightest case. A bad 
attack will compel attention, but " slight cases," so-called, are often neglected 
with fatal results, or life-long deafness or other disability. Dropsy, malignant 
8ore throat, disease of the kidneys, weakness of the lungs, pleurisy, and 
manv otlier maladies, lie in wait for the scarlet fever patient. — Hand-Book 
of I^arsiiig. 

The Treatment of Diphtheria.— Tiie symptoms of diphtheria are much 
like a common sore throat accompanied by a severe cold. The sore throat is 
accoiupanied with more fever than an ordinary cold, and there is an in- 
describable sickish feeling, which is easily recognized by those who have 
once experienced it. Later, white patches appear in the throat, on the ton- 
sils, the back of the throat, and on the arches of the palate. The throat is 
generally but little swollen on the outside, but in all cases when there is 
a suspicion of diplitheria, it is not safe to delay sending for a physician, a$ the 
disease does its work quickly, and miist be dealt with in time or it is fatal. There 
are really three varieties of the disease. The first is characterized by fever, 
severe pains in back and limbs, and very great prostration. There niay be 
wo soreness of the throat, but small white specks will be noticed on the ton- 
sils. In the second, large patches of false membrane appear on the tonsils 
and back of the tiiroat ; but the glands of the neck do not become swollen. 
In the third, wliich is the true malignant diphtheria, there is swelling of thn 
glands of the neck and under jaw, profuse and offefisive discharges from the 
mouth and throat, and more or less discharge from the nostrils. In the first 
two varieties, the disease generally yields to simple treatment, hut the disease 
is too subtle and dangerous to be trijled withy ana a physician should be sum- 
vioned. One of the best remedies for domestic use in the early stages of the 
disease, is, probably, chlorate of patash, put into a tumbler of water until 
no more will dissolve, and used as a gargle. If swallowed it is harmless. It 
is cheap— five to ten cents worth being sufficient for almost any case, and It

nuiy be k6pt in the house for emergencies. It is also an excellent remedy, 
used as above described, for ordinary sore throat In the case of children too 
young to use the gargle, make a swab on the end of a firm round stick, by 
binding on a small piece of linen or cotton cloth ; use only once and burn it, 
X. e.y the rag. Take the handle of a teaspoon and press the tongue down so 
as to see plainly the condition of the throat; swao quickly and draw out. 
Do not worry the child by poking the stick down iti* throat a half dozen 
times, make a sure thing the first time, for if you touch the affected parts, 
well; better do it again in two hours. Dip swab in a preparation (which 
may also be used a^ a gargle) of alcohol, diluted with water, biU as strong as 
the patient can bear. The alcohol acts quickly upon the poison of the disease, 
end is a remedy easily obtained and kept at hand. When atfjicked with 
diphtheria, the patient should be kept in bed with suflflcient clothing over 
the body for comfort, and no more. The room should be kept well supplied 
with pure air, and nourishment should he given in the shape of well-pre- 
pared beef-tea every two hours. Cut fresh beef into pieces, put into a bottle 
without water, and boil in a pot of water. To an adult give a great spoonful 
of the beef-tea tlius made, every two hours, and less in proportion to age. 
If this does not agree with the patient, or there is any difficuly in the 
patient's sw^allowing it, substitute the white of an egg; beat till smooth, mix 
with half a tumbler of water, and give a table-spoon at a time. This is very 
nourishing, and is often taken more readily than beef-tea. It is particularly 
important to nourish Vie patient with proper supplies of J'ood in the^arly stages 
of the disease, as there is danger that the supply of vitalized blood will not 
be sufficient to meet the demand made by the disease. 

• The homeopathic treatment is to begiryat once with aconite and belladonna, 
alternately every hour. If after four hours there is no improvement, and 
the characteristic prostration, and the patches on the tonsils are increasing, 
stop the aconite, and supply its place with the proto-iodide of niercurius. 
Let these two remedies be continued until there is a marked change for 
better or worse. If for the former, let the intervals be increased to one and 
a half or two hours; for the latter, and there is approaching unconscious- 
ness, with frequent arousing to cough up or hawk uj) the detached fragments 
of the deposits, that brings up tough, ropy, yellowish mucus, give kali bi- 
chromicum alone every hour. When the patient becomes really better, stop 
and give no more medicine while the improvement goes on satisfactorily. 

One reason why it is important to summon a physician as soon as the 
Bvraptoms of the' disease appear, is that many cases which appear slight^ at 
first, are really most serious and fataly. while a common sore throat excites the 
greatest alarm, the judgment of the physician being necessary to decide the 
amount of danger in the case. 

In some cases dry sulphur, applied to the tonsils and throat, gives relief, 
and in violent cases the fumes of sulphur, burned in the close room, have 
been used witli good effect. An outward application to the throat, of lard 
as hot as it can be b<irno, is an aid to the other remedies mentioned. 

To avmd all cansei of diphtheria^ keep (he house free from dirt and filth of 
every kind from cellar to garret. See tnat no sewers give off gases, no drains 
are left filthy, and no out-house uncleaned, and bear in mind that it is not 
enougli to destroy bad smells by disinfectants— the cause of the smells must 
be removed. 

A lady who had the courage and coolness to treat herself, through a severe 
case of diphtheria, when no physician was at hand, describes her case thus: 
*' I first noticed siwres (the characteristic white patches which appear on the 
throat) on my right tonsil at 9 a. m. By noon they had spread over the entire 
arch of the palate, and the back of the throat. Several or these were loosened 
before night, but during the night they had spread up the nose and down the 
bronchial tube. My palate and tonsils were so swollen that I could scarcely 
speak, and with difficulty swallow. The gland on the right side of neck was 
much swollen, and uched, cuusing a dull pain in the car. The breath had

that offensive odor peculiar to tlie disease, and I had an intense^ burning 
fever. I began my remedies <u sotm <u I dUcoaered the n)oref. I took a clay pipe, 
fille<l the bowl one-eighth full uf dry sulphur, powoered very fine, and sfiook 
it down into the stem. I then placed the end of tlie stem in my throat, and 
held it there in front of the spores, while an attendant blew in'to the bowl, 
atid repeated this until the whole discftned surface of tfie throat ^vas covered with dry 
3ul;>hur. taking care to hold my breath while the sulphur was being blown 
in. In half an hour this was repeated. I tlien made a strong gai^gle of chlo- 
rate of potash, and half an hour after using the last sulphur, gargled my 
throat thoroughly. I then alternated the sulphur with the gargle of dilorata 
^ of potash every liour. At niglit I mixed a tea-spoon of sulphur with water, 
and swallowed it slowly, and continued taking it in tliis way three times a 
day. Blowing sulnhur into the throat, and gargling with chlorate of potash 
was kept up regularly for four days, until every spore had disappeared, ex< 
actly as at first, except making the intervals longer as the disease abated. 
Whenever I felt them getting oown the bronchial tube, I drew breatli gentJy 
when the sulphur was being blown into my tliroat. It almost choked me to 
death, but I persevered. For my nose I snuffed up sulphur, just as old 
ladies take snuff, until satisfied that everv part was reached. When the 
spores came off I watched for new ones, and aid not relax my attention for 
one moment for five days. When better, I made a gargle of honey, sage and 
water, to heal and remove the swelUiv; in the throat I afterward treated 
xuy husbai^ successfully Cor the same disease, in the same way." 

Diphtheria is a disease which springs from the growth of a real fungus on 
some of the mucous surfaces of tne system, more generally of the throat It 
may spread by contact of the mucous surfaces of a diseased with those of a 
healthy person, as in kissing, and is, to a limited degree, epidemic 

From the local parts affected it si)reads to the whole body, affecting the 
muscular and nervous systems, vitiating the lymph and nutrient fluids, and 
producing paralysis. 

As soon as the bacterium or fungus appears on the white patches on the 
throat, it should no more be neglected than a bleeding gash or a broken amL 
and there is almost as little need of a fatal termination of one incident as or 
the other. 

Mother Kroh*8 Felon Salve. — Take two pounds of fat from the outside 
of ham or smoked meat, six onions, resin and beeswax, each the size of an 
egg (use tlie common dark resin and wax, and for summer use increase the 
proportion of both). Fry ham fat until partly done, add onions sliced, tij 
to a light brown, skim out onions, press through a colander, and add this to 
lard in skillet; add resiu and wax, heat' and stir until thoroughly dissolved, 
and pour into a pan to cool. Like all salves, it must be kept closely covered 
or it will lose its strength, but if well covered will keep a year. A mother 
writes, "I never feel safe without a supply of it in the house, and have 
found that my children seldom need any other medicine. I use it in croup, 
whooping cough, diphtheria, colds, scarlet fever, lung fever, asthma, felons, 
boils, beaiiugs of all kinds, burns, and sore and inflamed breasts. For the 
first seven, it is spread on a fine ])iece of Canton flannel and placed over the 
entire chest, and in severe Ciises over the back also, joining them on the 
.shoulders and under tiie arms. It should be put on thick and covered with 
flannel or cotton batting. Keep on until it gives relief, or if it becomes 
uncomfortable or rough, remove, and apply a fresh poultice if necessary. 
It is cooling in its nature and very quieting. For bums and healing It 
sliould be used in the form of a poultice, also Tor sore throat. My physicians 
have always encouraged its use for the above complaints. For breasts, cut a 
piece of cloth round with a hole in the center for the infant, then cover the 
breast entirely over with the cloth on which the salve has been spread.

Allopathic Trkatmxnt of Diphtheria. — One of the most successful phy- 
•icians in treating this dreaded disease gives the following directions for 
dealing with it. Mothers should accustom themselves and their children 

when young to examine the throat for indications of diph- 

^^ theria, and for this purjKwe a ** tongue depresser," repre- 

/1^'^\^ sen ted in aoconipanvinpj cut is much more convenient 

nf ^^k than a sjkmju, especially in the case of babies who are apt to 

/ft ^^^ resist having any thing thrust into their mouths. With 
mi ^^L this the tongue is easily drawn down, and does not slip 

%r ^^ from under it as it does from a sj^oon. It may be had 

^ from any druggist or dealer in surgical implements. The 
first yellowish white patches that indicate diphtheria ap- 
bear on the tonsils on either side of palate, and mean danger and demand 
tTMnediaU and unremitted attention. If toithin reajch tend for a physician. 
The attack is almost as varied as is the temperament and constitution 
of the patient. Sometimes a slight feeling of illness is prevalent for a 
few days before the most serious attack. During this period drowsiness 
and chilliness appear, followed by fevcrishness, sometimes headache and 
aching of tlie limos; at other times the attack comes on with a sudden 
faintness or an almost absolute prostration ; while an almost universal symp- 
tom, and a very characteristic one, is a slightly swollen and tender condition 
of the glands at the angle of the lower jaw. The tonsils, one or both, are red 
and swollen; sometimes they are swollen but are not red. In younger chil- 
dren an almost unmistakable sign, which is very general, is that "the redness is 
of a rose color, while in older children or adults the color is a deep crimson 
or bright scarlet, over the whole throat as seen by opening the mouth, the 
throat being attacked with inflammation so that it snows it. These symp- 
toms may be more or less general, or to a great extent mixed or varfable, 
according to the physical condition and temperament of the patient. After 
the appearance of this peculiar redness there is more or less swelling of the 
tonsils, at which time the false membrane first forms, and is semi-trans- 
^larent. It can readily be seen by careful observation. As the disease wears 
on. this membrane, which is at first visible and semi-transparent, changes its 
color and becomes partially opaque, finally becomes thick, dark, and if blood 
is drawn into it turns almost black. When the change from a darkened 
Opaque membrane commences to turn black it is one of the first symptoms 
of a putrid stage of the disease, and when this change takes place tliere is 
little or no help and decomposition en.sues. At this sta^e even all hope 
must not be abandoned, because sometimes bloo<iy matter is vomited, which 
to a great extent influences the color of the membrane. According to the 
strength of the patient this membrane is sooner or later thrown on. This 
exfoliation or peeling off" of the membrane sometimes takes place in every 
fortj'-eight to seventy-two hours, or about three days. At other times the 
progress of the disease is impeded by proper treatment. The life of the 
membrane is lengthy, and it may be from five to fifteen, and it has been 
known not to peel off under twenty days. Sometimes the membrane peels 
off in a few hours, forms again, each time going deeper into the tissues. In 
mild cases the disease shows itself in the fauces alone. Whatever may be 
the cause of diphtheria, most medical men agree ui)on an important point: 
That it conies from a poison in the blood ; and that thorough cleanliness will 
not propagate it — we don't mean in the u.««e of soap or water — but of proper 
diet, so that the stomach as well as the gkin of the body shall be clean. 

The time to begin fighting this disease is as soon as its nature is recog- 
nized. When the patches of false membrane first make their appearance on 
the tonsils, give as a cathartic, to a child of one year, a tea-spoon of Epsom 
salts; for five or .six years old, double above quantity. Next, mix thoroughly 

One dram chlorate of potash, 

One and a half ounces of lime water, and • 

One ounce of distilled water, and rub in a mortar until the chlorate of 



640 MEDICAL. 

potash is perfectly dissolved ; then add half an ounce j^nre glycerine. Give 
to a child one vear old one tea-spoonful every hour m a little sweetened 
water. For a cnild live or six years old, or an adult, use two and a half 
ounces of liiuc water, and omit the distilled water, and give as a dose a tea- 
spoonful and a half for the child and two tea-spoonfuls for an adult. Do 
not wait for the cathartic to act before beginning with this remedy, but 
when it acts give the following every hour, also alternating with the above 
(with intervals of half un hour between doses of one or the other): 

One dram chloride ferri (iron). 

One and a half ounces distilled water, 

One and a half ounces pure glycerine. 

Mix thoroughly and give in sweetened water, and give as a dose the same 
onantity as of the first prescription, keeping up the treatment for two days. 
During the night, if the case is severe, the patient should be wakened to 
administer the medicine, particularly if the sleep is at all restless or un- 
natural. 

For the first two days the disease may show no signs of abatement, but 
under this treatment, at the end of thirtjr-six hours, ttiere ought to be ini« 
provemenL The tendency of the fever is to return on the third day, and 
if the disease is not checked and the fever returns, it will be a fight for 
life, but if at the end of thirty -six hours there is evident improvement, 
give the medicines everv two hours (alternately giving one or the other 
every hour) for several aays. For a child old enough to use it, or for an 
adult, gargle well, before taking medicine or nourishment, with the follow- 
ing, well mixed: 

Fifteen drops carbolic acid. 

Six ounces lime water. 

These remedies m^y be made up, corked securely, and kept in a dark 
place, ready for use, in cases where a family lives remote from a drug 
store, as time is an important element in treating this disease. For an out- 
ward application apply a mixture made of 

A tablespoonful of camphor, 

A half spoonful of turpentine, 

A half spoonful of coal-oil. 

(For a child add a tablespoon of sweet-oil.) 

Apply this to the throat, high up under the ears and down to the chest; 
cover with dry liannels for a few minutes; remove, and if not red, apply 
mixture again, and repeat until the skin is well reddened. Then apply 
slices of fat salt pork (sewed on a piece of cloth), letting them cover well the 
front part of neck and extend up under the ears. The glycerine arresti 
putrefaction, while the lime-water dissolves the false membrane. 

Hot Wateb as Medicine. — Consumptives and dyspeptics find great relief 
in drinking, or rather slowly sipping, hot water an nour before eating. It 
should be as tiot as it can be taken. Sips of hot water are also good where 
the stomach is weak, as in convalescence after illness. In a severe case of 
dyspe()sia. the patient began by taking six teaspoons of hot water thres 
tiiiie» a day, and has graduallv increased the amount with the greatest 
henetit. Hot water is also excellent in cases of sick stomach, and may be 
taken when no nourishment of any kind can be retained in the stomach. 

M L'LLEiN FOR CONSUMPTION. — ^Thc leaves and flowers of the common mul- 
lein have cured consumption. Make a strong tea of the fresh or dried 
leaves (best when gathered from plants in blossom) and drink freely. Con- 
tinue from three to six months, according to the severity of the disease. 
This remedy is "good for the blood" also, building up the system, making 
good blood, and taking away the inflammation from the lungs. 

Fob a Cough. — Simmer together one ounce pressed mullein and one-half 
ounce hoarh^nd in a quart soft water till strength is extracted (add more 
water if necessary); strain and add one pint Orleans molasses. Dose— one 
tablespoonful three times a day.

Soft Wateb axd Cholb.ra.— A disUnguished physician gives it as his 
opinion that the hahitual use of pure soft water, or from wells in a locality 
where the rocks are freestone, will prevent the cholera. He states that 
cholera has always prevailed in a limestone region, among families using 
hard water, while those using soft water in same neighborhoods escaped, 
and tliose living in freestone regions only a few miles away were also ex- 
empt from attacks. Soft water from cisterns should be filtered before 
using. 

Cloveb Tea. — Gather the blossoms of red clover, when beginning to 
bloom, and dry for u-se, putting away in tight paper sacks. A tea made 
from these blossoms is excellent for "hives,"' cancer, or any^ disease of a 
scrofulous nature. The essence of clover is sometimes used instead of the 
tea, and is kept at drug stores. It is also good for sickness at the stomach. 
The tea may be made of the fresh blossoms also. For cancer the tea is 
^ven in large quantities, some patients drinking a gallon a day every day 
for a jrear before feeling certain of cure. This is largely prescribed by 
physicians. 

Taper Lights.— The best light for a sick room is furniahed by the tapers 
which come in boxes (bought at any dru^-store) in a vase or a tumbler 
of lard-oil. The taper is simply a small wick set in a tiny piece of wood. 
In the box of tapers is a float — a three-cornered frame of tin with a bit 
of cork on each corner. This is placed on the surface of the oil, and the 
taper set on it, the bottom of the wood resting in the oil. It mav then 
be lig;hted, and produces an a|preeable light, without smoke or smell, and 
Buificient for the purposes of the sick-room or nursery, and yet not sa 
glaring as to be oisagreeable. All persons accustomed to light in the 
sleeping-room will find this much better than a lamp turned low. The 
tunibler may be half full of water, with oil on top. 

To Promote or Restore Menstruation. — Put a small teacup of logwood 
chips into a pint of soft water, simmer for fifteen minutes, then add one 
half pint of whisky. Dose, one tablespoon half an hour before each meal, 
and just before going to bed. 

Another excellent prescription for the same purpose is made as follows: 
Two drams of prepared citrate of iron and quinine, one pint cherry wine^ 
one-half ounce chamomile flowers. 

Raw Linseed Oil is one of the best applications for burns, wounds, or 
cuts. It excludes the air and heals rapidly. Dip a cloth in it, and apply, 
covering with a second cloth. For flux or diarrhea in children, give a tea- 
spoonful three times a day until the disease has abated. Be careful not 
to use boiled linseed oil as a remedy in cases of men or animals. When 
boiled it is only used for painting. 

Cure for Couqh or Hoarseness. — One of the best remedies for coughs, 
colds, and particularly for hoarseness, is made as follows ; Wet a piece of 
ootton-battmg on the inside, wrap it around a lemon, and cover with ashes 
and coals to roast as you would roast a potato; let it roast from fifteen to 
twenty minutes ; take out, clip off one end, squeeze out the juice, and 
strain it through a thin cloth to remove any seeds or particles of pulp. 
There will be from four to five teaspoonfuls of juice, wnich mix with an 
equal quantity of strained honey (to strain warm and strain through a 
thin cloth) ; or, instead of honey, add three teaspoons of granulated sugar^ 
place the cup in a pan of hot water, set on stove until sugar is dissolved. 
Take one or two teaspoonfuls every hour, or after a spell of coughing. 
For a child add a larger proportion of honey and «ugar, and give a quar- 
ter teaspoonful every two hours. 

Bright's Disease. — Dr. Arthur Scott Dorkin extols a skim-milk diet in 
this disease. "The first appreciable action,'*, he says, "of skim-milk taken to 
the extent of six or Heven pints daily, is that of a most energetic diuretic, . 
a profuse flow of urine being rapidly produced. The effect of this in 
Bnght's disease, is to flush tlie uriniferous tubules, and to dislodge and 



642 MEDICAL. 

wash out the concrete casts of diseased epithelial cells bv which they are 
blocked up and distended. The emptying of the tubules relieves their 
pre:stfure on the surrounding secondary capillaries, the blood begins to flow 
more freely through them, the distension of the primary malpighian ca- 
pillaries is relieved ; less and less albumen escapes through their walls^ 
until the renal circulation is gradually restored, ^'hen it finally disappears 
from the urine. While this beneficial change is progressing, healthy epi- 
thelium is developed in the tubules, and the urinary excrement is withdrawn 
from the blood. In short, a healthy nutrition becomes re-established in 
the kidneys through the agency of milk, which, above all other substances^ 
seems to exercise a controlling influence over this process. 

IXHAL.VTIOX OF Tar FOR CONSUMPTION: — Mix together sixteen ounces of 
liquid tar and one fluid ounce liquor of potassa, boil them for a few min- 
'utes in the open air, then let it simmer in an iron vessel over a spirit or 
other lamp in the chamber of the patient. This may at first excite a aisposi- 
tion to cough, but in a short time it allays it» and removes any tendency 
to it 

French Remedy for Chronic Rheumatism. — Dr. Bonnet, of Graulbet, 
France, states, in a letter to the '*Abeille Medieale,'* that he has been long 
in the habit of prescribing " the essential oil of turpentine by friction for 
rheumatism ; and that he lias used it himself with perfect success, having 
almost instantaneously got rid of rheumatic pains in both knees and in the 
left shoulder." 

Magnetic Ointment Equal to Trask's. — Hard raisins cut in pieces, and 
fine-cut tobacco, equal weights; simmer well together, then strain, and 
press out all from the dregs. This is excellent for external applications, 
for cold in the head, api)lying it to the temples, outside and inside of nose, 
and forehead. Applied inside of nose it clears the head bv sneezing. It 
is also good for croup if applied first to the throat and afterward to the 
chest. 

Wens. — Dissolve copperas in water to make it very strong; now take a 
pin, needle, or sharp knife, and prick or cut the wen in about a dozen 
places, ju.st sufiftcient to cause it to bleed-, then wet it well with the cop- 
penis water, once daily. 

To Cure a Cold. — A bad cold should be "nipped in the bud." To do 
this no medicine is required. A person who finds he has taken cold should 
bundle up unusually warm in bed with a bottle of hot water at his feet. 
The object is to create a mild perspiration the entire night. Before dressing 
in the morning take a sponge bath in cool water and apply friction to the 
skin until it is in a glow. The cold, probably will then have disappeared, 
but If not follow the same course another night. But this remedy must 
be applied promptly after noting the first indications — ^such as sneezing or 
running at the noze ; if left a day or two, the cold will be sure to run its 
course. Often toasting the feet the whole evening by the fire will answer 
the purpose. 

Sleeplessness. — The loss of power to cast off the burden of the day, and 
find rest at night, is one of tne greatest of personal afflictions; vet, it is 
.^tte to say that wakefulness at night is an acquired habit, which can be 
overcome, like other bad habits, if not too long indulged. Let any adult 
person awake, say at midnight, and "get to thinking" for an hour oi two; 
do this the following three or four nights; he will find that it will then re- 
quire a powerful effort of the will to resist doing the .same thing for several 
nights thereafter. A person should never give way to the dangerous habit of 
lying awake at nights ; for that is exactly what it is, a dangerous habit, 
and nothing else. 

Trichin Jt. — Don't eat raw hog meat of any sort. It may contain trichiniB, 
and if it does, the undertaker may as well be sent for. 

Limb in the Eye. — When lime, soda, potash, or ammonia, gets in the eyi^ 
wash out with water containing a little vinegar.

Light Suppebs. — Give the whole family light suppers and send the children 
early to bed, 

Curb for Lock-jaw, said to be positive,— Let any one wUo has an attack 
of lock-jaw take a small quantity of spirits of turpentine, warm it, and 
pour it on the wound — no matter where the wound is, or what its nature 
IS — and relief will follow in less than a minute. ^Turpentine is also a sov- 
ereign remedy for croup. Saturate a piece of flannel witli it, and place the 
flannel on the throat and chest — and in very severe cases three to five drops 
on a lump of sugar may \ye taken internafly. 

Remedy for Consumption. — ^The following is said to be an efiectual 
remedy, and will in time completely cure the disorder. Live temperately, 
avoid spirituous liquors, wear flannel next the skin, and take, every morn- 
ing, half a pint of new milk, mixed with a wine glassful of the expressed 
juice of green hoarhound. One who has tried it, says, "Four weeks' use 
of the hoarhound and milk relieved the pains of my breast, rave mo nl)ility 
to breathe deep, long and free, strengthened and harmonized my voire anil 
restored me to a better state of health than I had enjoyed for years." 

Chapped Hands. — When the hands show signs of cracking wash them 
elean with mild soap and soft warm water. Rinse in borux water and 
thoroughly dry them. Then anoint them with vaseline or petroleum 
jelly, which can be ^ocured at any drug store. Dry it by the fire and a 
cure is sure to follow. This vaseline never fails. With it the skin can be 
kept soft and velvety all the time. 

Relief for Burning Feet. — To relieve burning feet, first discard tight 
boots ; then take one pint of bran and one ounce of bicarbonate of soda, put 
in a foot-bath, add one gallon of hot water; when cool enough, soak your 
feet in this mixture for fifteen minutes. The relief is instantaneous. This 
must be repeated every night for a week or perhaps more. The bran and 
bicarbonate should be made fresh after a week's u.se. Bicarbonate of soda 
can be purchased for a small price per pound from wholesale druggists. 
The burning sensation is produced b}' the pores of the skin being closea, so 
that the feet do not perspire. 

Croup can be cured in one minute, and the remedy is simply alum and 
molasses. The way to accomplish the deed is to take a knife or ^rate and 
shave off in small particles about a teaspoonful of alum ; then mix it with 
twice its quantity of mol&sses, to make it palatable, and administer it as 
quick as possible. Almost instantaneous relief will follow by vomiting. 

Cure of Croup. — A lady writer of professed experience gives the follow- 
ing advice to mothers whose children have the croup : First get a piece of 
chamois skin, make a little bib, cut out the neck and sew on ta^>es to tie it on ; 
then melt together some tallow and pine tar ; rub some of this in the chamois 
and let the child wear it all the time. My baby had the croup whenever she 
took cold, and since I put on the chamois I have had no more trouble. Re- 
new with tar occasionally. 

To Cure a Felon. — Take a pint of common soft soap and stir in air slacked 
lime till it is of the consistency of glazier's putty. Make a leather thimble, 
fill it with this compasition and insert the finger therein, and the cure is 
certain. 

Poison by Ivy. — An infallible remedy for poisoning by ivy, poison oak 
and other iX)ison vines and plants, is good rich butter milk in which you 
have beaten some green tansy leaves until the milk is thoroughly tinct- 
ured. Bathe the parts often (indeed, you could not do it too often,) until 
relieved. Wet a cloth with the mixture at night, and lay on, wetting as often 
as it feels dry. 

Alger Liniment. — Alcohol, one gallon; cagiput oil, one ounce; monard 
o^l, one ounce; thymes oil, one ounce; i)epi>ermintoil, half ounce; camphor 
gum, one ounce. Shake well and let stand twenty-four nours. It is good 
for rheumatism and for anv purpo.se for which liniment is used for man or 
beast. This is aVery valuable recipe and has been sold at a vpry high price. 



644 MEDICAL, 

Water Treatment at Home. — ^The following methods of treatment with 
water, etc., have been tested, and we know whereof we speak when we say 
tliey work like a cliarm. A thermometer is needed to test the temperature, 
as the terms hot, cold, warm and tepid are so indefinite ; what is hot to one 
person is cold to another, in the morbid states through which sick people 
pass, and the sensations of healthy persons are so variable that they can not 
be relied upon to temper baths by the touch, for those with whom a slight 
change is of consequence. Generally 70° Fahrenheit would be considered a 
cold oath, 85° tepid, 95° warm, and 105° hot. The time of taking baths ia 
from an hour to two hours after, and never within half an hour before, eat- 
ing; and those who are taking treatment for chronic ailments, or for cleanli- 
ness, should not bathe when tired ; but when one is suffering from acute 
diseases, and becomes restless and nervous, a sponge-bath or, if able to bear 
it, a pack or a sitz or foot-bath will greatly refresh and soothe. From ten to 
twelve in the morning generally finds the bod^ at its highest point of vigor, 
and as treatments are most beneficial then, this proves the best time; but if 
this can not be, take just before retiring. In all baths a cold wet cloth should 
be kept on head and jug of hot water, with rubber cork, at feet (except in 
foot-baths), keeping head cool and feet warm. When baths are to be reduced, 
add cold water till right temperature is reached ; but after foot-baths the better 
way is to have a pail ot cold water and take what is tailed a foot-plunge, im- 
mersing the feet one at a time, for a moment, in this pail; or the cold water 
may be poured right over the feet. The theory is this : wherever water is 
applied to any part or the whole of the body, at so high a temperature as to 
relax the coats of the capillaries and distend them with blood, it must be 
followed by an application at so low a temperature as to constringe the ves- 
sels and restore their tone. When bath is completed wrap at once in a dry- 
sheet and rub vigorously with a crash towel, as the patient must not have any 
chilly sensations, and the skin should be left all aglow. A strong person 
may now take anv exercise wished, so as to establish thorough and perma- 
nent reaction, but delicate persons had better rest for an hour or two. 

The Sitz-Bath. — ^This is a very pleasant remedy for a great many ills. To 
take, have a sitz-bath tub, which is either of tin or wood, something the shape 
of a chair, the seat being the tub, and the back is hollowed out to fit the back 
of person; or one can be improvised by taking a large wash-tub and placing 
something under at back, so as to incline it. Patient undresses and sits in 
tub, with water enough to nearly fill it when he sits down, with a foot-tub 
of water for his feet; place blanket around him from the front, so as to well 
cover him, and tack in carefully at the back ; place a cold wet cloth on head. 
The general temperature for a sitz is 92° for ten minutes; 88°, five minutes; 
and for foot water 100°. Now have a pail of cold water, and plunge feet one 
at a time in it, then throw a dry sheet around him, and rub dry quickly and 
vigorously with a crash towel. These site-baths are ^ood for colds, diarrhea^ 
piles, female weakness, urinary trouble, bilious colic, and, in fact, almost 
every ill that flesh is heir to. 

For colds — a sitz-bath as warm as can be borne (106° is good), adding hot 
water as it cools, so as to keep it at that temperature for fifteen minutes ; 
with foot-bath hot, hotter, hottest. Keep well wrapped up, a cold wet cloth 
on head, rub thoroughly dry, and go right to bed. Or some follow with a 
dripping sheet; and others who are robust, and wish to break up a severe 
cola, take this hot sitz, then a pack at about 85°, then a dripping sheet, and 
diet carefullv for two or three days, remaining in bed if possible. Where it 
is only a slight cold a hot foot-bath, as described elsewhere, suffices ; and this 
is also better for children under six or seven years of age, as you can not 
easily give them a sitz. 

The temperature of a sitz-bath, in different diseases, is about as follows: 
Colds — hot as can be borne. Diarrhea— cool, about 90° for ten minutes, and 
84°, five minutes. Piles — 96°, ten minutes; 90°, five minutes. • Female weak- 
ness— 94°, ten minutes; 88°, ten minutes. Profuse menstruation — 84° -five 



MEDICAL, 645 

tnfnutes; 78®, five roinntes, and 72®, five minutes. Urinary troubles— 92®, 
ten minutes, and 88®, tive minutes. Bilious colic and for all acute pains — 
102®, rapidly raised to as hot as can be borne, but take out patient before 
])er8piring. Chronic pains — 104®, three minutes; 90®, five minutes, and 86®, 
live minutes. For malaria— 104® at first, adding hot water till the person per- 
flpires. For retention of urine, with a desire to urinate — a sitz-bath at lUO®, 
ten minutes, and 90®, five minutes, with foot-bath as hot as can be borne, 
with cold plunge and a vigorous rubbing with damp salt, repeated for two or 
three days, will give perfect relief. 

The sitz-bath is of great importance in drawing the blood from the brain, 
and also relieves congestion of the abdominal structures. The usual length 
is from fifteen to thirty minutes, according to strength of patient, if an in- 
valid, or as it feels comfortable. 

The Foot- Bath. — ^This good old remedy for colds, etc., as given, was always 
attended with the risk of taking more cold. This is easily overcome by the 
very simple adjunct of a pail of cold water in which to plunge the feet, and 
give bath in this way for a cold : At night have a foot-tub of hot w^ater — UO®, 
or hotter if patient vnU bear it; and he can be dressed or undressed, but must, 
in either case, be well wrapped with a blanket, a cold wet cloth on head, and 
as water cools add hot. In ten or fifteen minutes take out feet and plunge 
for a moment in pail of cold water, then wipe dry and rub to a glow, retire 
at once, and in the morning all traces of the cold, such as head stopped up, 
aore throat, etc., will have disappeared. For a little child, where ne can 
not take the plunge, wet a towel in cold water, and take his feet on your lap 
and rub with the wet towel, and then wipe dry. The plunge or cooling of 
the water ought to follow all foot-baths, whether for colds, a tired feeling, 
headache, cleanliness, etc. Where one has had a hard day's work nothing is 
more restful than a foot-bath as hot as can be borne. The usual foot-bath is 
104®, and hot water added to keep it at this point for ten or fifteen minutes ; 
but where it is given with sitz, no more hot water is added. For chronic 
cold feet have water as hot as can be borne one minute, then plunge feet in 
cold, then in the hot a minute, and repeat this from six to a dozen times, 
ending with the cold plunge, and then rub vigorously. For a child, need not 
make so many changes. Take this three times a week. For a sprain, this 
treatment is one of the best ; or a spray of hot a minute, and then a cold spray, 
then hot, and so on for half a dozen times. 

What is called by some a deep leg-bath is only an '* extension foot-bath,** 
and is of prime importance in congestion of the brain, catarrh, and, in fact, 
any head trouble, as it is purely a derivative bath. It is given best in a tub 
twenty-eight inches high, top diameter twenty inches, and bottom seventeen 
inches. Have patient stand in this with water to his hips, of the tempera- 
ture of 108® or 110®, for ten minutes, cold wet cloth on his head, and a sheet 
wrapped around him ; step out and spray the legs, or even the whole body, 
with water of the temperature of 86®, and gradually reduced to as cool as 
can be borne; or a bucket of water 85® can be thrown over legs, and then 
one at 75®. Where there is severe congestion of the brain, have two pails 
of water, same temperature as tub, placed on each side. Iiigli enough to c<mic 
np even with top of tub, and have patient immerse his arms in these. The 
deep leg-bath can not be taken till two hours after eating, but the ordinary 
foot-bath in an hour or an hour and a half. A foot-batn may be given in 
bed by placing a rubber cloth under the foot^tub, and it gives great relief 
ofttimes. 

Fomentations. — The method of giving this treatment is very simple, and 
yet very few give them correctly. First, have flannel cloths, made of four 
thicknesses white shaker-flannel (or pieces of a blanket), sewed across the 
center from corner to comer, and also all around the udpes. Different sizes 
are needed : one, 10 by 13 inches, for across iimall of back ; one, 12 by 17 
inches, for, over chest, stomach and bowels; and one, 5 by 18 inches, for 
down the spine ; then one for the throat. And of course one can make any 



646 MEDICAL. 

shapes wished ; and, where there are children, many different sizes must be 
in readiness in the bath-room cupboard. Fomentations are good for all 
pains, aches, inflammations, inactivity of stomach and liver, and are always 
a success, giving relief to pain at once. Where the case is acute they should 
be given daily, and in severe cases oftener — if necessary, continuing for 
two hours at a time. (Have known them to be given for five consecutive 
hours.) The usual length of time is twenty or twenty-five minutes, giving 
four or five changes of five minutes each. For a child, if rather wcaJ^ give 
only two or three changes, and repeat oftener. if for pain, whenever it re- 
turns. The manner of treatment is this : Place on a bed or cot a comforter 
and blanket. Let patient undress entirely, as he does for a pack, and lie 
ui)on the blanket, with a jug of hot water at his feet; then wrin^ the flannel 
out of boiling water — and there are different ways of doing this — as, to be 
eflicacious, the cloth must be very hot — as hot as patient can bear, and he can 
bear it a great deal hotter than he thinks. Of course, for children, the one 
who gives treatment must be the judge. One rule is, what you can bear to 
your face ; or some put one thickness of dry flannel next skin, and then the 
hot fomentation ; or wring flannel with your hands, or have water at 150°. 
But, for adults, the best way is to immerse flannel in boiling water and 
wring with a wringer — a small one, fastened to a wooden pail, being very 
convenient; or, if one has a bath-room, have a sink in tnat, and fastea 
wringer to it; or a small tub can be arranged with feet, so it can be moved 
into any room necessary. The next best way is to place in a foot^tub a 
cloth of two thicknesses of heavy muslin (flour sack will do), extending over 
the ends of tub ; place flannel folded in center of it, and have two square 
sticks (two feet long and inch and a half square) ready to place at each end, 
resting on top of flannel; pour on the boiling water, put in sticks, and let 
one person take hold of each, turning sticks, bringing up the muslin around 
it, and then wring in opposite directions; or, if only one person prepares 
cloths, have another dry muslin cloth, and, aft«jr boiling water is poured on 
flannel, lift all into this dry cloth, and then wring. This is rather severe on 
the hands, but can be done. Now put flannel on part to be fomented, and 
bring up one side of blanket, then the other, and then comforter, placing a 
cold wet cloth on head. (If patient is sick in bed, a piece of dry flannel oin be 
placed under him, if back is to be fomented or if the upper paVt of body, over 
the fomentation cloths, and then, in either case, tuck bed clothes w^ell around 
him.) Let flannel remain five minutes, wring again; or, if you have two 
cloths, have second one ready, and let it remain on five minutes, and so on 
for twenty or thirty minutes. In chronic diseases repeat this three or four 
times a week, and it will prove to be one of the best treatments to reduce 
chronic inflamnjation and congestion of the stomach, liver, bowels, spleen, 
and kidneys. After the fomentations, sponge off part fomented with tepid 
water, rub dry with a towel, and oil witn sweet or cocoanut oil ; and if for 
pain or soreness, use sweet oil and ammonia, prepared by dropping ammonia 
into sweet oil till it becomes white (to a two-ounce bottle of oil, three or four 
drops). This rubbing with oil prevents taking cold. In pneumonia nothing 
is better than hot fomentations given as described. In rheumatic fever, add 
cooking-soda to the water, in proportion of table-spoon to a quart of water, 
and foment right over the heart. In rheumatism, neuralgia^ bilious colic, 
et(\, etc., fomentations avail much, giving instantaneous relief sometimes. 
Sickness at the stomach, a dizzy, heavy feeling, and severe pain in head, 
will all be relieved at once by fomenting the stomach. For a bal)e who 
has severe colic, when fomentations are applied with two thicknesses of flan-r 
nel next skin, and with care, they are just the thing. In any bronchial or 
lung trouble, these given over the lungs, chest and throat, extending half 
way around neck, have been known to in time effect a cure where the voice 
had been almost lost. The effect of fomentations is to bri?ig the bl<3od to the 
surface, and thus prevent inflammation and congestion. Tliey can be taken 
any time, except half an before or an hour and a half after eating. 



MEDICAL. 647 

Female Weaknesses. — One of the best treatments for leucorrhea, ulcera- 
tion, and, in fact, any female weakness, is the hot vaginal enema. The best 
syringe to use is one that has only side openings in the metal tube, and this 
is an easy way to give it: Place a blanket in the long bath-tub, letting it 
reach down to the hips when you lie down on your back. The temperature 
most often used is 110° for ten minutes, and 100® for five minutes; but it can 
be as hot as can be borne, as what is unpleasant to the surface is hardly felt in 
the interior; and by placing a folded olanket under the hips, so as to raise 
them quite high, ana closing the opening around the tube of the syringe 
when inserted, a pint of water may be retained for several minutes, acting 
AS a fomentation to the inner surface ; then eject this and inject more, and 
fio continue for ten to twenty minutes. Repeat this three times a week, and 
wear all the time, day and niglit, a compress made of three thicknesses of 
linen, long enough to pass well around the abdomen, wet in tepid water, 
with a dry flannel (about two thicknesses) over it; re-wet the compress 
whenever it becomes drjr. Then there are the fomentations and sitz-baths, 
described elsewhere, which are invaluable. Another special treatment is 
the pelvic compress : Take two or three thicknesses of linen, about 12 by 10 
inches, and have bed or cot arranged as for a pack ; have patient lie down 
upon the blanket, with jug of hot water at feet, and cool cloth on head; 
then wet compress in water at 80° and place over abdomen, extending well 
over the affected parts; bring up blanket and comforter, and in five minutes 
wet cloth in water at 74°, in three minutes 70°, in five minutes G4°, in three 
minutes 60°, in five minutes cold, and after five minutes take towel and rub 
•dry. This, repeated three times a week, is very strengthening. In preg- 
nancy, tepid sitz-baths, the wearing of the compress around abdomen, and a 
diet of fruit, grains and vegetables, with oil-baths occasionally, if one is not 
fleshy, keep the svstem in a healthy state. 

Compresses. — The use of compresses is good for so many ailments that one 
should know how to apply them. Compress cloths are made of two or three 
thicknesses of old linen (crash toweling is good), and can be of whatever 
shapes wished. The difference between compresses and fomentations are, 
the first is wet, and wrung so it will not drip, in tepid or cold water, — hence 
linen is best; while the latter is wet in hot water. A dry flannel of two 
thicknesses, a little wider and longer, is put on over theMinen compress, 
which is re- wet three times a day in chronic cases, or when it feels un- 
comfortable. The throat compress, for chronic trouble, is wet in tepid water, 
and is worn day-time in summer, and at night in winter; and when taken 
off, the throat is bathed in cold water and rubbed till red with a cra.sh towel. 
The chest comi)ress, in acute cases— such as pneumonia — should bo re-wet 
every three hours in water at 90°; for chronic lung trouble, re- wet whenever 
it feels unpleasant. The abdominal compress is one of great value in fevers, 
kidney trouble, indigestion, weak back (for thi?, use salt in water), female 
weaknesses, and is aiwavs a relief when one is tired and restless. For acute 
or clironic cases, wear till the disease is conquered. The spinal compress is 
used where there is pain in the spine, with sense of heat, and is given like a 
fomentation, only with the linen compreas: 70° for five minutes; (U°, five min- 
utes; 60°, five minutes; 54°, five minutes; 50°, five minutes; and sometimes 
the last changes are ice-cold. For weak back caused by a .sore f>lare, use a 
hot flannel compress five minutes across small of back, then a r<»ld linen 
one, then hot, and so on for half an hour, with cold last, rubbinj; dry with 
ijrash towel. Another remedy for simply a weak back, is to first sjMingV with 
hot water one minute, then cold one minute, for two or three times, rub- 
bing dry, and then use oil and ammonia. Compresses are very much used 
after giving fomentations, and, in that case, no si)onging off in cool water 
or oiling is necessary, but immediately put on tlie wet girdle and cover with 
dry flannel. 

Facks. — First, it is much more convenient if you can have what is called 
a '* packing cot" made. A good proportion for the frame- work is thirty 



648 MEDICAL. 

inches wide, twenty-five inches high, with the slate placed on a slight ele- 
vation, about three and a half inches, at head. Then a mattreaa, made to lit 
(it can be of straw or whatever ^ou wish); on that place an oil-cloth, then 
a comforter, then a blanket, stripes at side, and a jug of hot water, with 
a rubber cork, at foot. Now have the patient undress. Take a sheet, and 
with one hand pleat up the side of it, and with the other double it at mid* 
die seam and dip it in a pail of water of the temperature of 96^ or 100° (jroa 
must allow five or six degrees for cooling ofT in wringing out sheet), wrine 
and spread over the blanket. Have patient lie on his back in center, with 
hands over head ; bring one side of sheet over the body, tucking it under the 
near shoulder and up close to the neck, and then between the legs; put arms 
down at side of body, and bring other side of sheet over the patient and tuck 
in closely under the side of the body down to the feet, then one side of blanket, 
then the other, then comforter in same way. In folding the blanket and com- 
forter around neck bring it with one hand, in shape of a V, over the breast, 
and then fold corner up to the shoulder and tuck in. This saves so much bulk 
close up to the neck. Now fold a dry sheet across the middle and put over 
the patient, tucking it in well around the neck, so that no air can get in. The 
reason of using this extra sheet is, it is so much easier tucked closely around 
tlie neck and less bungling than the comforter. It it of gnat impofiance thai 
all air be exchuUd and the work done quickiy. Place a cloth wet in cold water 
on the head, extending over the eyes. If the patient does not warm up 
quickly, put an extra comforter or blankets over him, and, if necessary, jugs 
of hot water at the side ; for unless he becomes warm soon, the pack will do 
no good, and he should be taken out The usual length of a pack is from 
forty minutes to an hour, for an adult; for a child, from ten minutes to 
half an hour — according to age and strength. There must be perfect qniet 
in the room, for much Detter results are obtained if the patient will sleep: 
he certainly niu.st not talk. In taking him out unloose comforters and 
blankets, aiid pull the wet sheet out quickly and throw over the dry sheet, 
or, in winter, bring up the blanket There are several different treatments 
that follow a i>ack. If convenient to a bath-room, one can slip in and take 
a wasli-off, or a spray, or a pail-pour. The latter is given by having four 
pails of water — two of one temperature, 90®, poured over first, and then two 
of 8()°; then wrap around him a dry sheet and take a crash towel and wipe 
dry, taking, in rotation, arms, breast back, and legs. Or a dripping sheet 
caii be given right in the room by putting an oil-cloth on the carpet: oit 
that put a foot-tub of water at 104° ; the patient stands in this, and a sheet 
is dipped in a nail half full of water at 90°, or less, tal.en up by two comers, 
s<iueezed slightly, and put around him from the front lapping behind, and 
then rub him (over the 8heet) vigorously for a minute; re-dip the sheet 
(water will be cooler, or some cold may be added to make it aboat (>° or 8° 
less thini at first), and put it around from behind, and rub again; then re- 
move, and cover with a dry sheet and rub vigorously. This bath is a good 
treatment taken alone as well as after a pack. It arts as a tonic, and a well 
person can take it himself. Or, if an oil-bath, sponge or dry rub is given, 
let him remain on the cot and, for an oil-bath, rub an arm dry with a crash 
towel, then rub with oil, and so on ; for a sponge-bath, take a sponge (or a 
towel) and topid water, and sponge off, rubbing dry with a crash towel : for 
a dry rub, sim])ly rub dry with a crash towel, rubbing hard to create good 
cinnilaticm. The temperature of the room should be about 75°; and whi-n 
the patient is taken out of the pack, let no cold air come on him. The tem- 
perature of the wat4>r in which sheet is dippe<i, for adults generally, is not 
so imiM)rtant, fus within two or three minutes it becomes of the same tem- 
perature as the body ; from 90° to 100° is a good range, but for children and 
delicate jHTsons it sliould be from 100° to 110°, so as not to shock them. 
Packs are of great value in reducing: fever, in breaking up a cold, in malarial 
diseases, such as fever and ague, etc. ; and also in poor circulation and where 
the .system is weakened and run down it acts as a tonic. In the spring, when 



MEDICAL, 649 

the system needs bnilding up, just try a few packs instead of the sulphur 
and molasses of old times. 

Oil-rubs. — This treatment is one tliat elves perfect satisfaction to all who 
try it ; indeed, too much praise can not be given to it. To see the effects of 
oil-rubs, one would say as did the Queen of Sheba, "The half has not been 
told." To give it, have the patient imdressed, with a sheet or blanket around 
him, sitting up or lying down; take either cocoanut, pure olive, or sweet 
oil, whichever can be obtained the purest; pour some in palm of hand, rub 
hands together, then take aTi arm and rub in the oil thoroughly, rubbing up 
and down, using more oil if necessary (as much as. skin will absorb) ; cover 
this arm ; take more oil and rub the other arm, then breast, back and legs; 
cover each part when finished. Repeat from three to six times a week, as 
the case may demand. One who is greatly reduced can take with benefit 
six a week. ' Once a week take a wash-offi or an acid sponge, by putting 
a scant tea-cup vinegar in a ^llon of warm water, and using a sponge or 
towel, then ruobing dry. This is esj)ecially good for consumptives, dyspep- 
tics, and persons who, from any cause, have been reduced in flesh and 
stren^li. It acts as a tonic, — thus it is of twofold value where one is re- 
covering from sickness, as it is also nutritive to them, and to those who 
are cold-blooded it warms up the system. So for children it is especially 
good in winter, as an oil-rub at night will assist in keeping them warm ; 
80 in the day-time, if going on a long drive, or to be exposed to the cold 
/or awhile, it is a good "send-off." For colds it works to a charm, for 
young or old, acting as a preventive, as it builds up the system, and renders 
it less liable to disease. Or, when a cold is taken, it is easily broken up 
by a pack, followed immediately by an oil-rub, and the next two nights 
simply oil-rubs, a hot foot-bath, 108®, then cooled down, and followed by 
a complete oil-rub. Where adults or children are delicate, the oil-rub 
gives good, healthy flesh ; and where it is given as described, the result 
18 perfect. For constipation it is invaluable, working a perfect cure after 
a month or two. It can be given at any time, without reference to eat- 
ing, as it is a nutritive bath. The following description — given by Dr. 
James H. Jackson of "Our Home on the Hillside," at Dansville, N. Y., 
where these rubs have been used for many years — tells in forcible lan- 
guage their use and value: 

"Oil-baths are given by rubbing the body all over with some kind of 
oil. It is not necessary to use more than two or three table-spoonfuls at 
one bath, but it should be rubbed in thoroughly, especially over the ab- 
domen, inside the arms and thighs, where it can be absorl)€d to tlie best 
advantage. They may be taken at any time during the day. It is as well, 
perhaps, to take them before going to bed as at any other time. They may 
oe given to meet any one of three conditions: 

" 1st. To .*«upply waste of tissue and to introduce a very important ele- 
ment of nutrition into the body. Manv persons will absorb oil to advan- 
tage nutritively, who can neither take it nor fats by the stomach without 
great distre.«^s or disturbance. 

"2d. To improve the functions of the skin, which has become dry and 
hard, and lacks prox)er circulation in its capillaries. 

"3d. To allay nervous irritation and reduce fever. Persons in parox- 
ysms of fever, in typhoid, measles and scarlatina esjiecially, may be freely 
anointed with oil U) great advantage. In my practice I have often seen 
the temperature of the body, when in a febrile state, reduced from one 
to three decrees by the administration of an oil-bath. 

"I like the cocoanut oil better than the olive, as it is more likely to be 
genuine; it f»enetrates better, it does not turn rancid on the body, and I 
think it furnishes more nutriment U) the body. Olive oils, as a general 
thing, are impure." 

From the above you can see it is "multum in parvo," as it can really 
be depended upon for use in almost every thing the flesh is heir to ; and 

40

the ^reat beauty rtf it is, any one can give it without feeling fear as to the 
results. It can not do hami unless the patient is very fleshy; then it is not 
needed. It is .so easily given that a child can give it to younger children. 
Its use in reducing fever is of untold value. A lady, who had had ex- 
tended experience in using it, says: *'I have known an oil-bath given a 
patient, in scarlet fever, with fever raging, and in a little while the tempera- 
ture was reduced, and he was quietly sleeping." 

For little babies it is really a blessing, as it nourishes and strengthens 
them; and given every other day, with a sponge-off in warm water the 
intervening day, an infant will do much better than when bathed daily. 

It is also a great help in supplying nourishment where the mother has 
not sufficient nurse, and aiils, too, in preventing the little colds, snuffles, 
colic, etc., that hover around the little one tlie first two or three months, 
neiHiing our most watchful care to ward them oft Then, where there is 
any constipation, it is a perfect panacea — ^so much better than physic or 
enemas. It act.s as a preventive to croup; and when a child is weakened 
by that dread disease, cholera infantum, nothing so helps to give tone to 
the system as the oil-rub. It certainly is the best of baby medicines, and 
a baby can "grow up" without any other remedy. 

Diphtheria. — This dreaded disease needs all the knowledge one can pos- 
sibly obtain, so we give below the hygienic treatment as prescribed by 
Dr. J. H. Jackson, of "Our Home," Dansville, N. Y. First, he says, to 
tell a genuine case, make a swab and apply to the patches on throat; 
common ulcers will rub off, but diphtheritic patches will not A good 
gargle is to make a solution, as strong as will aissolve, of chlorate of po- 
tassa, and bottle for use. When needed, take in proportion of one-half 
solution and one-half {)ure soft water, and one-hali grain permanganate 
of potash to ounce of mixture. For a still stronger gargle, take two-thirds 
solution to one-third water, and one-half grain permanganate of potash 
to ounce of mixture. In a case of diphtheria, keep the room at 80°. and 
have boiler of water on stove, or hang wet sheets in room, in order to 
keep the room saturated with warm vapor, and also have fresh air in the 
room. His treatment is as follows: 

" When the person is attacked, in cases where the epidemic is present 
in the vicinity, with a sore throat, pain in the head, in limbs, in back- 
in other words, the symptoms being very -much like those of a hard cold — 
I begin by putting the person at once into a hot bath, covering him up 
and giving him warm water to drink, so as to produce a thorough sweat- 
ing, the object being to fight febrile conditions and establish and aid proc- 
esses for throwing oflF the disease by means of the skin, bowels, etc. This 
sweating is all the more necessary, in most cases, because of the inatten- 
tion which is usually given to keeping the pores of the skin open, and 
it will relieve the fever, if not at once, as a secondary result. After the 
person has been in a state of perspiration for some time, I take him im- 
mediately from the hot bath and give him a thorough washing with a 
sheet wet in water at 80 degrees, in a warm room, and after wiping see 
that he is sent to bed with a cool cloth upon the head, and in many 
cases an abdominal compress wet in cool watt^r, which shall cover entirely 
the abdomen, with a dry flannel cloth over it. In all febrile conditions of 
the body this application of the cool abdominal compress is of great value, 
because it is in the alxlomen that the vital processes are carried on to 
large extent, the amount of blood existing there being much larger in 
proportion to the surface of the body than in any other portion of the 
frame except the brain. In order to keep the temperature of the body 
down' below fever heat, that the fermentative processes may not go on, 
or be held in check as far as possible, it is necessary to u.se with caution 
all the best means for the purpose, and among them I certainly esteem 
the abdominal compress as of great use. After this, and in addition to 
it, the febrile conditions may be met by means of wet sheet packing or 



MEDICAL. 651 

spongring as frequently as may be necessary, to keep the temperature to 
its normal standard. Of course, if the fever is not high, it will not be 
necessary to make strenuous elforts in this respect; but if it is, it should 
be fought sharuly. The great need is to make the applications early and 
vigorously in the outset of the disease, because the enects to be produced 
are needed then more than at any other time, and because in the later 
days or stages of the disease attention must be directed to measures which 
support the strength of the body rather than those which, while reducing 
fever, tax its vitality to some degree. At any rate watch the tempera- 
ture carefully, and keep it down. Great attention should be paid to nour- 
ishing tlie patient, ana the best article for this pur{)Ose, both for adults 
and children, is milk, taken cool or warm, as the patient may fancy, and 
at as frequent tinies and in as large (quantities as can be borne. To tlii's nuty 
be added, later in the disease, nutritious soups or the juice of meats; but 
under no circumstances, except toward the very last stages and in the sep- 
tic form, are alcoholic stimulants admissible, in my judgment. The bow- 
els should be kept open and the kidneys active, and for this purpose 
enemas should be given to effect the former if sluggish, and sitz-baths 
occasionally — perhaps one each day — for fifteen minutes, at a temperature 
of 85 or 90 degrees, to stimulate the latter. The feet must always be kept 
warm and the head cool, and in case there is any tendency to collapse or 
lowering of the temperature below the normal standard, heat must be 
applied to the body by means of warm blankets and hot water bags and 
Jugs. 

" In addition to this general treatment, treat the throat direct with moist 
heat, as that is the great promoter of suppuration. Hence, us soon as the 
membranes are formed, or as soon as it is known that the disease is diph- 
theria, the patient should be put upon the inhalation of steam as hot as 
can be borne, and as often as may be wise, considering the strength of the 
patient and the severity of the disease. The inhalations ordinarily should 
be pursued for the first twenty-four or forty-eight liours, as often as once 
in each half hour, and continued for fifteen minutes, and the patient 
should be allowed only three to four hours of sleep each day during tins 
period, because the constant presence of the vapor is necessarj' to hurry up 
the suppurative process, and the earlier tliis can be produced the sooner 
the case will recover. These inhalations may be made by means of the 
common steam atomizer, now sold by all dealers in surgical and medical 
instruments, and which may be used without filling the njedicine cup ordi- 
narily, the steam being taken direot from the boiler through the mouth- 
piece. If this is not convenient, a tea-kettle with a long conducting spout, 
which shall carry the steam to the mouth of the patient, or any apparatus 
which shall answer this same purpose, can be used. The^ air of the room 
may be saturate<l with warm vapor by dropping hot stones in a pail of water 
or of lime water. Care must be taken in any event to see that the steam 
is not too hot, and at the same time that the heat is as great as can be well 
borne. This process mav be aided by application of warn) poultices to the 
neck. A long, narrow bag may be' filled with any substance which will 
retain moisture and heat well, and the neck enveloped in it, a dry flannel 
being put over it, and this changed as often as is necessary in order to 
maintain the warmth. Thus moist heat on the inside and moist heat on 
the outside, aids to establish the necessary process of suppuration. This 
con.stant inhalation should be kept up until the membranes cease to spread, 
and those wliich are formed become well marked in outline, and grow yel- 
lowish or a dirty pray in color, and seem to be shriveled or wrinkled, after 
which, generally about the third day, the inhalations mav be decreased in 
frequency, but still should be kept up as often as every liour in the day- 
time, the patient being allowed six or eiiEjht hours' sleep at night, until the 
membranes are thrown off and the secretion of pus ujx)n the mucous mem- 
brane of the mouth entirely stopped. The constant inhalation of steam

through the atomizer, which generates it with some force, furnishes a means 
of washing the parts pretty thoroughly." 

The Vapor-Batu is one of the most efficacious remedies if taken when a cold 
is first realized. It is given by seatine the patient, undressed, in a flag or cane 
seat chair under which is a saucer of alcohol burning, both chair and patient 
being perfectly enveloped in a blanket reaching to the floor. In a few min- 
utes profuse perspiration sets in, which should he kept up ten or fifteen min- 
utes. After rubbing dry, the patient, still wrapped xn the blanket, gets into 
bed, and remains there for an hour or two at feast. It is better to take the 
bath just before retiring. This remedy is better than all drugs, nostrums, eta, 
for a cold, but vshould be taken at the outset, to do the most good. 

For Diarrhea.— Stir lightly into a tea-cupful cold water the white of one 
egi?, not beaten. This forms a coating on the stomach, and is also nourish- 
ing, and is good in any disease where patient can not eat. Another delicate 
S reparation for a weak stomach is slipi)ery«elm gruel : Mix fine slippery-elm 
our with cold water, then stir into boiling till tnickness of gruel. Charcoal 
crackers are of great value in assisting digestion. 

In this disease, the most important item is absolute quiet on a bed. Bits of 
ice may be eaten and swallowed at will, but drink little liquid of any kind. 
If compelled to be on the feet, bind a strong piece of woolen flannel tightly 
around the abdomen, having it doubled in front For diet, use rice parched 
like cofiee, boiled and eaten with a little salt and butter. Some advise mak- 
ing a tea of it, and also u.sing boiled milk and mutton broth, with crisped 
white crackers, for children. 

For Dysentery and Diarrhea. — ^Use ice-cold enemas after each movement 
of the bowels — a tea-spoon for a babe, increasing in that proportion tUl, for 
an adult, a bulbful is given. 

For Sore Throat. — Rub on the outside, and wet cloth in Pond's Extract, 
and gargle with it also, taking from one to ten drops four times a day. An- 
other excellent remedy is camphor diluted with water till it can be used as a 
gargle. 

Another remedy for sore throat is to put on a strip of flannel thin slices of 
fat pork, and snnnkle very thick witli black pepper and place around throat; 
or chop fat pork and onions together, about half and half, and put in sack 
and put on ; or bathe throat with coal oil. And some have advised taking 
some of the latter internally in cases of diphtheria; also, in diphtheria, some 
have used with benefit bits of ice kept constantly in the mouth for as long 
as seven hours; or gai^^le with lemon-juice, occasionally swallowing some. 

Whooping-cough. — Children do not " whoop" for two or three weeks after 
taking this disease. The most reliable symntoms are, eyes red and watery 
when they cough, and the cough clinging to tne patient with a firm grasp. It 
lasts from six weeks to three months, according to season when taken, and can 
be given during the first two months. It is not carried in clothes, but when 
a child gets the breath of a whooping-cough patient then he will take it 
Some of the remedies are, to give drinks of water as hot as they can be taken, 
in the evening and with first symptoms of a cougliing s])ell — this makes the 
couf?h easier; another is, to take scant t^a-cup whole flax-seed, wash it thor- 
oughly, add one lemon sliced and quart of water, simmer gently two hours, 
add two table-spoons of honey, then strain when hot. It should be like thick 
molasses; if too thick, add water. Give one table-six)onful four times a day, 
and one after each severe fit of coughing. (This is also good for an ordi- 
nary cold and cough.) The system of the patient needs to be built up, and 
for that purpose give two oil-baths a week ; also good, nourishing food, such 
as Graham or oatmeal mush, coarse bread, milk, etc. ; and keep child out- 
doors as much as possible, using great care no cold is taken. Some, when 
the breathing is very bad, put a hot mustard and oatmeal i)oultice on the 
chest. In cities, a daily visit to the gas works has been said to abate the vio- 
lence of the disease. 

Fob Croup. — To one-half cup N. O. molasses add a tea-spoon soda, beat to 



MEDICAL, 653 

a white froth, and give a tea-spoon every few minutes till relieved by vomit- 
ing; or one port pulverized alum to two parts white sugar, and s^ve in same 
way; or grease a cloth (made in the shape of a bib) thorougliTy and dust 
thicklv witli nutmeg, and put on over throat and chest, kec])ing it on for 
several days after the child is well, and when taken oif put on a tlannel cloth 
for a few days, and then some morning take this off and bathe well in cold 
water and rub dry; or take four or five hollyhock blossoms, boil, and apply 
wet around the throat; or apply hot fomentations to the throat and cnest, 
sponge off with tepid water, rub dry, and apply oil and ammonia ; or some' 
apply cold wet cloths over throat and chest, covering well with flannel, 
changing often, until inflammation is subdued. From two years to eight is 
the croupy period ; and when a cold assumes croupy symp'toins great care 
should be taken to keep the child indoors, in a warm, well-ventilated room, 
giving Hght food, no meats, hot bread, or berries. (Raw or cooked onions 
are good as a preventive to either worms or croup.) A remedy, said to give 
relief where other means fail, is to let a healthy person fill his lungs with pure 
air, then slowly breathe upon the patient's throat and chest, commencing at 
the point of the chin and moving slowly down to bottom of windpipe. 

Fob Weak Eyes. — Bathe in hot water, never using cold ; and neither chil- 
dren nor adults should use water below 50° temperature in washing, as cold 
water is very injurious to the eyes. 

Fob Sobeness aitd Pains. — Bathe with hot alcohol ; and salt is often added. 
The use of alcohol sponge-baths after confinement is almost a necessity. 

To Habden Nipples. — Bathe with a preparation of one-half ounce liauid 
tannin and two ounces glycerine, for three or four months before connne- 
ment, once or twice a day. 

* Fob Sobe Nipplbb.— Bathe in Pond's Extract. The nipple need not be 
washed off before nursing. Or to the well-beaten white of an egg add a few 
drops of tannin, mix thoroughly, and bathe. Make fresh every day or two. 

Fob Vabicose Veins. — Wear a silk elastic stocking. 

Fob Cold in the Head.— Dilute camphor with water one-half and snuff it 
np the nose. 

Fob Chilblains. — ^Heat lard till it boils, pour it on ice (it turns yellow), 
then rub it on the feet and heat it in. Another for broken chilblains: Melt 
together one ounce resin, one and a half ounces beeswax, and three ounces 
sweet oil ; take off, and stir in gradually one-half ounce prepared carbonate 
of lead till it cools. 

Fob Toothache ob Neubalqia. — Thicken the yolk of an egg with common 
salt and apply as a poultice; or slice raw onions, and scatter shaved hard 
soap over them and apply. 

cThapped Hands and Lips.— Four parts glycerine to one part simple tinct- 
ure of benzoin. The latter is very healing. 

SuBE Cube fob Cobns.— Take one-fourth cup of strong vinegar, crumb 
finely into it some bread. Let stand half an hour, or until it softens into a 
good poultice. Then apply, on retiring at night. In the morning the sore- 
ness will be gone, and the com can be picked out. If the corn is a very ob- 
stinate one, it may require two or more applications to effect a cure. 

Itch Ointment. — ^Two table-spoons lard, one of black pepper, one of ground 
mustard; boil all together, and when taken off and nearly cold add one table- 
spoon sulphur. Anoint with this three evenings successively just before go- 
ing to bea. Do not change bed clothes or wearing clothes during the time. 
After this, wash with castile soap suds, and change all the clothing that has 
been worn or touched. 

Choleba Mixtube.— Take one ounce each of the following ingredients: 
tincture opium, capsicum or red pepper, rhubarb, peppermint and camphor; 
put in large bottle, with a pint best orandy. Dose is ten to twenty drops in 
two or three tea-spoons water. Good in any case of diarrhea. 

Constipation.— Two ounces of senna, simmer the strength out m one quart 
of water, strain the tea ; one pound of prunes, cooked soft, with half tea-cup 



654 MEDICAL, 

of white sugar. Several times a day take, first, one table-spoon of the senna 
tea, then eut one prune, fasting as much as poMsible. 

Sure Cire for Cholera Infantum. — One ounce pulverized rhubarb, one 
ounce peppermint herb, one ounce soda. Pour one pint of lx>ilinp water on 
tliese three and let stand on the hearth two hours. Strain, and add one pint 
best brandy, one-half pound best white sugar, and one ounce paregoric. 
Dose — one tea-sjxion every half hour until the discharge shows the color of 
the medicine ; then only every three or four hours. Good also for adults, in 
diarrliea. Tiiis is the allopathic treatment. 

(lOLDEN O1NT.MENT. — One pound lard, eight ounces beeswax, one ounce cam- 
phor gum in five ounces alcohol, one ounce origanum, one ounce laudanum; 
let all tlissolve while melting tiie lard and beeswax, then stir together until 
cold, or the camphor will go off in a steam. Do not mix too hot. This will 
cure pain in the side by a]>plying as a plaster. For enlarged neck or goitre, 
dilute with one-fourth i(Khn'e. For salt-rheum, apply externally, and take 
cathartics to cleanse the blood. For scald-head, rub together one ounce golden 
ointment and three drachms of red precipitate; remove the hair and rub with 
this twice a day, each day washing with castile soap suds. For catarrh, rub 
the ointment up in the nose profusely, and let it remain all night. In the 
morning draw cold water up the nose and throw it back two or three times 
to clean tlie tubernated bones. Also bathe the face and ears with cold water. 

Chronic Infl.vmmation of the Stomach. — This is known by a pain in the 
stomach, increased by the presence of food, by belching up gas, by vomiting, 
fickle appetite, seasons of thirst, tongue white in the center and red at tip, 
or sometmies red and smooth — is a di.scase which soon ends in ulceration 
of stomach, and death. Counter-irritants over the stomach, such as mustard 
draughts, followed by hot fomentations of hops; frequent warm or cool baths, 
according to patient's constitution ; a tepid compress worn over the stdTnach 
at night; and the most careful diet, consisting mostly of gum water, rice 
water, slippery-elm water and gruel, arrowroot gruel, toast without butter, 
gluten mush, etc, and in two or three weeks the disease will yield under 
this persistent starving and cooling system. 

Blistered Feet. — To cure blistered feet from long walking, rub the feet* 
at going to bed, with spirits mixed with tallow. 

Frosted Feet. — To relieve the intense itching of frosted feet, dissolve a 
lump of alum in a little water and bathe the part with it, warming it before 
the fire. One or two applications are sure to give relief. 

For a Felon. — Take equal parts of gum camphor, opium, castile soap, brown 
sugar; wet to a paste with spirits of turpentine, and apply like a salve. Those 
who have tried it say it is an invaluable remedy. Or take common rock-salt, 
such as is used in salting down beef or pork, and mix with spirits of turpen- 
tine in equal parts, and as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours 
you are cured. Or, when you fear afelon is coming, put a pint tin of boiling 
water on the stove ; then add to that a tea-spoonful of saleratus and a wine- 
glass of vinegar; heat this every little while, say from half an hour to an 
hour, and hold your finger in it till the pain sui)sides; repeat this till you 
see all the matter drawn to one place; then have it opened, and your finger 
will heal. After a felon has been lanced, apply a poultice of equal parts of 
flaxseed and slippery -elm flour to take out inflammation. 

Fever and Ague. — This, the true intermittent fever, comes on with an 
ague-fit, which has three stages — the cold, the hot, and the sweating. In 
the first stage, the patient yawns, stretches, feels weak, has no appetite, and 
does not wish to move. The face and extremities become pale, the skin 
shrinks, and is covered with gobse-flesh; the patient shakes, and his teeth 
chatter. Then, after a time, these symptoms decline, and the patient's fev^er 
comes on very violently, and with various uncomfortable sensations. As the 
fever passes off, the sweating stage comes on, when the perspiration is gen- 
erally profuse; the body returns to its natural temperature, the pains and 
aches vanish, and a feeling of health comes back, and generally a voracious 



MEDICAL. 655 

appetite. There is not much regularity in the time of coming on or going 
off of the ague-fits, though usually they are a little later each day in appear- 
ing. J'l this disease the spleen is very much oppressed with olood driven in 
from the surface, and often becomes so much enlarged as to be plainly felt 
by the hand. This is a malarious disease. The bowels may be opened with 
a gentle physic, such as salts and senna. In the cold stage, give hot and 
stimulating drinks, use foot-baths, hot bottles, etc., and try every expedient 
to promote warmth. In the hot stage, give cooling drinks, and administer qui- 
nine mixture, as the following: quinine, one scruple; alcohol, four ounces; 
sulphuric acid, five drops. Mix. Give a tea-spoonful every half hour dur- 
ing the fever, at the same time giving five-drop doses of veratrum veride 
every hour. When the sweating stage comes on, stop the veratrum, and rub 
the patient with dry towels. In the intermission give quinine. In mild 
cases, other tonics than (quinine often effect a cure. The nursin(^ of the pa- 
tient, and bathing, sweating and rubbing are the most important part of the 
treatment, in this, as in most other diseases. In ague districts, the hot sun 
and evening air are to be avoided. 

Or take two ounces of gum camphor and inclose it in a flannel bag about 
four or five inches square. Suspend the bag over the pit of the stomach by 
the means of a cord around the neck, and a speedy cure will be effected. 
When the camphor is dissolved the ague is gone. German physicians, as 
appears from medical journals, have found a tincture of the leaves of the 
Eucalyptus globulus, or Australian gum-tree, to be a remedy for intermit- 
tent fever, Dr. Lorimer gave it to fifty-three patients, of whom forty-three 
were completely cured. The ordinary sunflower, if planted around a house, 
will free the atmosphere from the animal and vegetable germs supposed to 
contain the miasma productive of fever and ague. 

Bilious Remfttent Fever. — This makes its attack in a sudden and marked 
manner. There are no premonitory symptoms except, perhaps, a little lan- 
guor and debility, slight headache, and a oad taste in the mouth, sometimes 
some {)ain in the joints. Its commencement is with a chill, sometimes slight, 
sometimes severe and prolonged. The chill may begin in the feet, or shoul- 
ders, or back, running thence like streams of cold water. There is seldom 
more than this one chill, the fever coming on afterward without the cold 
stage. At certain periods of the day there is greater intensity of the symp- 
toms, and possibly the chill, though probably not. Between these periods of 
increased fever the disease seems to decrease, though there is still some fever. 
TTnlike fever and ague, it does not go entirely off. During the hot stage the 
pulse is up to 120, or still higher, and there are pains in tlie head, back and 
limbs, of the most distressing kind. The tongue is covered with a yellowish 
fur, and, in bad ca^es, is parched, brown or almost black in the center, and 
red at the edges. The appetite is gone, and there. is generally nausea and 
vomiting, and pain or tenderness in the upper part of the bowels. At first 
there is costiveness, but afterward the bowels become loose, and the evacua- 
tions are dark and offensive. This disease is produced by malaria, and pre- 
vails in hot climates, and in our summer and autumn. In the verv beginning 
the disease may be arrested by an emetic of lobelia or Ipecac, follow^ed by a 
mild cathartic. But if the disease is fully developed, sj)0nge the body all 
over several times a day with water, and give cooling drinks, such as cream 
<artar, two scruples, in a quart of water, lemonade, etc. To allay the fever, 
give tincture of veratrum viride in ten-drop doses. Cold water and ice may 
oe given the ]>atient, if desired. Cool the head, when it aches, with cold ap- 
plications, and put a mustard poultice on the stomach if tender. During 
the remi.ssiolis between the fever, quinine and other tonics must be given, as 
in fever and ague. 

Congestive Fever. — Another form of malarious fever is the congestive. 
It may be either remittent — that is, abating considerably; or intermittent — 
that is' having intervals of entire freedom from fever. It may have intervals bf 
twenty-four or of forty-eight hours. The first attack does not differ from that 



656 MEDICAL. 

of a simple intermittent, and may excite but little attention ; but the second is 
always severe, producing great coldness, and a death-like hue of the face and 
extremities. The advancement of the disease brings dry, husky, parclied, 
and pungently hot skin, followed after a time by a cold,' clammy sensation. 
The eyes are dull, watery, and sometiiues glassy; the countenance dull, 
sleepy, distressed ; the tongue, at first white, <*hanges to brown or black, and 
is usually tremulous ; theoreathing is hurried and diflficult. Pressure over 
the liver, stomach or bowels, produces pain. The mind is often dL«turl>ed, 
and falls into lethargy and stupor, or is delirious. The treatment should be 
nearly the same as in bilious remittent. While convalescing, the diet must 
be light and nutritious at first, increasing in quantity as the strength returns. 
Use a mild tonic if the patient is weak. Exercise out of doors must not be 
neglected. 

Hay Pkveb (or Asthma). — This very peculiar dise^e api>ears ccnerally as 
a severe attack of catarrh, with asthmatic svmptoms superadded. The lin- 
ing membrane of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs is all more or less atTecte*!. 
The i)atient suffers from headache, sometimes severe, sneezinj?, irritation of 
the nose and throat, with a dry, harassing cough. The asthmatic attacks come 
on generallv towards evening, and last from one to three hours, cau.sing great 
distress. liay fever is not a very common complaint, and only attacks tiiose 
persons who, from some peculiarity of constitution, are susceptible to tlie 
causes producing it. It is supixised to be caus<Hi by the inhalation of the 
pungent aroma of spring grass and hay; but the inhalation of the |)Owder of 
ipccacuanlia will ah^o produce it in certain individuals. In the United States, 
where the rose is largely cultivated, similar attacks sometimes occur; it is 
then called rose fever or rose catarrh. The best treatment is change of air — 
to the sea-side, if }K)ssible. During the attacks antispasmodics, such as sal 
volatile, ether, or an emetic if the i)atient is able to bear it, inhalations of hot 
steam meilicated with oret^sote, carbolic acid, or turpentine, will be found 
useful. When the attack passes off, the general health should be improved 
by tonics, diet, etc. 

TvPHOin Fkver. — Typhoid fever is generally preceded by several days of 
languor, low spirits, and indisixwition to exertion. There is also, usually, 
some i»iun in tne back and heaa, loss of appetite, and drowsiness, thotigli not 
rest. The di>e}ise ^hows it.'^elf by a chill. During the first week there is in- 
iTea^ed heat of the surfai^e. frequent pulse, furrtnl tongue, restlessness and 
>leeplt»ssness, headache ami pain in the back ; sometimes diarrhea and swell- 
ing of the belly, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. The second week is 
bitten distinguished by small, ra'<e-ct>lore<l si>«>ts on tne belly, and a crop of 
little watery pimples on the neck and chest, having the appearance of mi- 
nute dri>ps'of Mweat ; the tongue is drv and black, or red and sore; the teeth 
ari» foul ; there may be delirium and (dullness of hearing: and the symptoms 
every way are more serious than during the first week. Occasionally the 
bowels are at this peri<-Hl perforatetl or ate thnmgh by ulceration, and the 
(mtient ^uddenly sinks. If the disease proceeds unfavorably into the third 
week, there is low, muttering delirium, great exhaustion, sliding down of 
the patient lowanl the f<x>t of the bed, twitching of the muscles, bleeding 
from the bowels, and re<l or purple spots upon the skin. If, on the other 
Iiand, the i>a»ient impn>ves, the countenance origb tens up, the pulse moder- 
ates, the ttmgue deans, and the dist^harges look healthy. Give the patient 
go<Hl air, and frequeiU siK>ngings with water, cold or tepid, as roost agree- 
able. Keep the Newels in order, and be more afraid of diarrhea than cost- 
ive ne;«i. Diarrhea should be re5«trained by injection of cold water. For 
o»stiveness» give mild injections, made slightly loosening by castor oil or 
tN^nimon molassea To keep down the fever and produce perspiration, give 
tincture of veratrum viride. ten drops every hour. If the bowels are swelled, 
rolieve them by liot fomentation of hops and vinegar. If the pain in the 
head is verv severe and ct"»nstant, let tne hair be cut short and the head 
UiiluHi frequent I V with cold water. Give light nourishment, such as milk 



MEDICAL. 657 

«t<^. ; and if the debility is great, broth will be needed. Cleanse the mouth 
with very weak tea— old hyson. If the fever runs a low course, and the pa- 
tient is very weak, quinine may be g^ven from the beginning. Constant care 
And good nursing are very important. 

Typhus fever is distinguished from typhoid by there being no marked dis- 
ecuse of the bowels in typhus. The patient must be placed in a large, well- 
ventilated room, where drafts may oe avoided ; he should have his bed so 
situated that the light from a window will not fall upon his face, as this 
is annoying; all curtains, carpets, and bed-hangings should be at once re- 
moved; the bed should not be too soft, and a mackintosh or india-rubber 
sheet should be placed under the patient. He should not be allowed to ex- 
ert himself in any way, as it is absolutely necestiary that he husband all his 
strength. The greatest cleanliness must be observed, and all excreta removed 
at once, and carbolic acid or chloride of lime should be mixed with them ; soiled 
linen should be put into a tub containing some carbolic acid. Bed-sores are 
very liable to form on the back, and so the nurse must always be on the look- 
out and try to prevent them by smoothing the sheets, drying the patient, and 
rubbing brandy and balsam of Peru over the part ; better still to have a wa- 
ter cushion or water bed. The skin may be S{ionged down with tepid water, 
one part being sponged at a time, so as to prevent any undue chill of the 
surface from exposure ; this relieves the patient and partly counteracts that 
disagreeable smell which the skin gives off in typhus cases. None but the 
nurse and doctor should see the patient; all noises must be stopped, and 
jierfect quiet enjoined ; at night there may be a small light in the room, but 
so placed as not to disturb the patient Milk must be the chief article of diet, 
and is best given cold ; an eg^ or two may be beaten up in it, and three or four 
pints of milk may be given m the twenty-four hours; this must be done at 
regular intervals of two hours, in equal quantities, special care being taken 
that it is given at night and in the early morning, when prostration is great- 
est. Beef-tea and broths, jellies, extract of beef, custards, etc., may be given 
if the patient can take them and wants them. For drinks in the early stage, 
lemonade, cold tea, or soda-water may be given, but do not let him have too 
much effervescent drinks ; in bad cases the nurse will have plenty to do to 
get the milk down. Stimulants are very useful, but the quantity must vary 
with each case, and be left to the doctor's judgment. Brandy is the best 
stimulant, and may be given with iced milk ; too much must not be g^iven at 
first, as it causes oppression and inability to take nutrient food; but after- 
wards, in the stage of great prostration, its proper and careful administration 
tnay save the patient's life. 

Yeli/>w Fever. — This disease is most prevalent in hot climates, and south- 
em cities of our country. It comes in the latter part of summer, and lasts 
till fro.sty weather. The disease begins with a chill, generally not very se- 
vere. Following the chill, there is moderate fever, and some heat of the 
surface; but this rarelv rises to any great height, and only continues to the 
second or third day, when, in fatal cases, it gives place to coldness of surface, 
etc. In many cases there is sweating. The pulse is peculiar, not often over 
a hundred, but feeling like a bubble under the finger, which breaks and van- 
ishes before it can be fairly felt. The tongue is moist and white in the first 
and second days; but red, smooth, shining and dry as the disease advances 
toward the close, having a dry, black streak in (he middle. The most strik- 
ing symptoms are nausea and vomiting, which, in fatal cases, is very per- 
sistent ; and toward the last a yellowish or greenish matter is thrown up, 
followed by a discharge of thin black fluid, which is called the black vdinit. 
The lK)wels are generally costive, with tenderness in the upper bowels or 
iJtoniarh. There is generally severe headache, and a peculiar expression of 
face, in which the lips smile, while the rest of the face is fixed and sad, 
sometimes wild. The patient continues wakeful night and day. There are 
discharges of blood, often from the nose, the gums, the ears, the stomach, 
tlie bowels, and the urinary passages. First move the bowels with some 



658 MEDICAL, 

mild physic, such as sweet tincture of rhubarb, four ounces; bicarbonate of 
8oda, two drachms. Mix. Give a table-8{K)onfuI once in three lionrs until it 
operates. During the chill, use all tlie usual means of warming the bo<Iy — by 
hot bottles, mustard foot-bath, warm drinks, draughts, etc. A warm poultice 
on the stomach is useful — some would advise cupping. During the Siecond, 
or rnlm stage, give gentle stimulants, warm drinks, and tiveMlrop doses of 
veratrum viride, also quinine. In the third stage, brandy, t|uinine, and all 
stimulants freely. To quiet the vomiting, give of this preparation: creo- 
sote, twenty drops; spirits of mindererus, six oimces; and alcohol enough 
to dissolve the creosote. Do^e — half an ounce, every two hours. 

Temperance, cleanliness, and all good habits, do much to i>revent this dis- 
ease. A French physician asserts that liahilitv to yellow fever is prevented 
by drinking onlv lx)lle<l water. He believes that the fever is the exclusive 
result of using corrupted water, and that, if one is attacked by it, he may be 
cured in a few hours bv drinking large quantities of boiled water. Many of 
our best authorities believe that infusoria is the cause of the disease. 

Food por Babies.— Mix a babe's food milk with its due proportion of sugar, 
and place the pitcher holding it in a deep plate— a soup-plate or pie-dish will 
do— and fill the plate with cold water. Take a piece of thin muslin, lai^ge 
enough to cover wie whole pitcher and reach down all sides into the water. 
Have no cover on the pitcher, wet the cloth and cover the pitcher with it; 
put its ends into the water, and set the whole into a place where a draft of 
air will pass over it. A mother tried the plan, and during an exceedingly 
hot summer, through the most sultry days and nights of a long season, the 
milk never turned at all. The rationale of the thing is easy. The milk is 
not confined in a close vessel, or in danger of being tainted by nearness to 
other, perhaps not wholesome food ; the thin gauze protects it,"^ yet leaves it 
open ; the draft of air keeps the temperature down by the constant evapora- 
tion, while the water is constantly sucked up by the cloth, acting like a wick 
in a lamp, to supply the moisture. 

Headaches. — ^Headaches are always symptoms of some derangement of the 
system in some of its parts, and should not be neglected. In cliildren, they 
generally indicate the approach of some disease. In adults, they are occa- 
sioned frequently by a bad circulation, impaired digestion, and by affections 
of the nerves. For the first, active exercise and a slight physic are only nec- 
essary; for the second, light diet, with exercise and a dose of some bitter 
alkali after meals; and for the third, the same treatment as for neuralgia, 
being careful about the diet. Sometimes a patient is subject to rheumatic 
headache, which may be treated with warm fomentations, stimulating lini- 
ment, and a gentle physic. The patient should dress warmly, and avoid ex- 
posure to cold and wet feet. 

A doctor in Paris has published a new remedy for headaches. He uses a 
mixture of ice and salt, m proportion of one to one-half, as a cold mixture, 
and this he applies by means of a little purse of silk gauze, \*ith a rim of 
gutta j>ercha, to limited spots on the head when rheumatic headaches are 
lelt. It gives instantaneous relief. The skin is subjected to the process from 
half a minute to one and a half minutes, and is rpndered hard and white by 
the application. — 2. Put a handful of salt into a quart of water, add one 
ounce of .spirits of hartshorn and half an ounce of camphorated spirits of 
wine. Put them quickly into a bottle, and cork tightly to prevent the esca|ie 
of the Hi>irit 8oaK a piece of rag with the mixture, and apply it to the head; 
wet the rag afresh as soon as it gets heated. — 3. It is stated that two tea-spoons 
of finely-powdered charcoal, drank in half a tumbler of water, will, in less 
than fifteen minutes, give relief to the sick headache when cau.sed, as in most 
cases it is, by superabundance of acid on the stomach. We have tried this 
remedy time ana again, and its efficacy in every instance has been signally 
satisfactory. 

Palpitation of Heart. — Palpitation and irregular action of the heart are 
often experienced in persons between the ages of sixteen and twenty years; 



MEDICAL. 659 

they are, or have generally been, growing rapidly, are of delicate appearance, 
.and frequently are addicted to some vicions habits. In such persons the 
blood is thin and poor, and the heart and nerves fail to perforin their proper 
function for want of support. Derangement of the stomach often gives rise 
4o these svmptoms, and they may persist for a long period from this cause. 
A lady who for years suffered from violent paroxysms of palpitation, which 
many physicians attributed to organic disease of the heart, happened on one 
<K-casion to take some medicine which induced vomiting, ana this act was 
followed by immediate recovery. Subsequently, whenever she had the symp- 
toms of an approaching attack of palpitation, she resorted to an emetic, which 
not only gave relief to the paroxysm, but finally relieved her altogether. In 
another case, a patient entered a hospital, suffering severely from violent ac- 
tion of the heart ; he was bled and blistered and purged, without benefit ; 
having taken a large dose of medicine, vomiting ensued, with immediate and 
permanent relief. 

Tea, and especially green tea, is very liable to disturb the heart's action 
•when used by susceptible persons. Aiid there is no doubt that an immense 
number of persons m every community suffer from minor forms of heart 
•derangement, due to the use of tea. 

Tobacco, either smoked or chewed, invariably affects the heart's action, and 
produces irregularity and palpitation. 

Jaundice. — A disease characterized by yellowness of the skin and eyes and 
urine, the discharges from the bowels being of a whitish or clay color. It is 
caused hy the excretion of bile being prevented and retained in the blood, or 
reabsorbed and diffused through the system. It depends upon various and 
-different internal causes. Pregnant women frequently suffer from it. Any 
kind of pressure upon the excretory ducts, such as by tumors, etc., or the ducts 
being filled up with mucus, inspissated bile, or biliary calculus will occasion 
it. It may also occur as a symptom of chronic or acute inflammation of the 
liver. Fits of anger, fear or alarm have sometimes been directly followed by 
an attack of jaundice. And, lastly, certain forms of it are produced occa- 
fiionally by long-continued hot weather. An attack of the jaundice is usu- 
ally preceded by symptoms of a disordered state of the liver and digestive 
organs, loss of appetite, irregular or constipated bowels, colic, nausea, head- 
ache, languor, etc. Sooner or later the yellow color begins to appear, usually 
first in the eye, then in the face, then on the chest, and finally covering the 
■whole body. Sometimes the yellowness is the first symptom ; and again, as 
noon as the yellow stage is reached many of the prelimmary symptoms di- 
minish. The shades of yellowness are various— from a light j^elfow to a deep 
orange hue, and, in some cases, of a greenish or even a blackish color. In 
the latter cases it is known as "black jaundice." The greenish or darkish 
varieties are considered most dangerous. 

Sonio kinds of jaundice are absolutely irremediable, while others will pass 
off without any treatment. If the patient be young, and the disease compli- 
cated with no other malady, it is seldom dangerous; but in old people, where 
it continues long, returns frequently, or is complicated with dropsy or other 
dweases, the condition upon which it depends generally leads to a fatal re- 
sult. In general, the obvious treatment is to promote secretion of the bile 
and to favor its removal. In ordinary cases, a strong infusion of rhubarb 
root taken freely, so as to keep up a laxative action, without active nurging 
or vomiting; a cool, light, ana laxative diet (such as T\\yQ fruits, mild vege- 
tables, chicken and veal broth, new eggs, stewed prunes, and buttermilk); 
free ventilation, and hot fomentations twice a dav, for half an hour, over 
the liver, in case of torj>or and obstruction ; or Qo\h cloths, in case of exces- 
sive production of bile, will usually effect a cure. Some prescribed an infu- 
sion of thoroughwort, drank freely every day. Cold water should be the 
onlv drink ; no coffee, tea, etc. As much exercise should be taken as the 
patient can stand ; and if there be any spasmodic pain in the right side, the 
patient should sit frequently in a warm bath up to his shoulders. Any sX- 



660 MEDICAL, 

tack of janndice may turn out seriously, and therefore as soon as the symp- 
toms develop themselves a physician should be sent for. Persons subject to 
jaundice ought to take as much active exercise as possible, and should avoid 
all exhausting food and stimulating drinks. 

Diet in Disease and Health. — Of the grains for mushes, rye is most flesh> 
making, oatmeal second, and Graham third. For laxativcness — rye first, 
Graham second, oatmeal third. Graham builds up nerves, bones, and sin- 
ews ; dark gluten the same ; light gluten is more fattening than the dark. 

Changing Clothing. — People often take cold by removing heavy under- 
clothing too early in the spring. This should never be done until weather is 
settled. When about to make the change, take a cold hand-bath or sponge- 
bath and rub briskly, in the morning, and there is no danger of taking cold. 

Cutting the Hair. — Many children and men take cold after having the 
hair cut. This may be prevented by a quick dash of cold water on the head 
immediately after cutting, and before going out, and a brisk nibbing after- 
ward. 

A Simple Remedy for Catabrh. — Place alum on the stove and let it melt 
and burn until it becomes a dry powder. Then use it as snuff. 

Change of Climate. — A change of climate is nearly always beneficial t» 
health for a time, and sometimes effects a complete cure in disease. It is still 
more likely to do good if a chan^ of habits and diet goes with it 

Children's Beds. — No two children should sleep m the same bed. Tbey 
will have better health and thrive better to sleep by themselves.

Move and let it boil, ixnd it i.s said you will smell no uisaj^reeable odor. 

To Softkv Levther.— The best oil for making boot.s and harness leather 
soft and pliable, is rastor-oil. It is also exeellent for greasing vehicles. 

Color of Paint for Tools. — Tools expose«l to the sun sliould be painted 
witn light-colored paints, as they reflect instead of absorbing the heat. 

Gluk. — PowdenMi chalk added to glue strengthens it. Boil one pound 
glue with two quarts skimmed milk, and it will re.sist the action of water. 

To KEEP Pearls Brilliant. — Keep in common, dry magnesia, instead of 
the cotton wool used in jewel cases, and they will never lose their brilliancy. 

To MAKE Boots and iiwoEs DraABLE.-- Apply to the soles four or five 
successive coats of gum-coi)al varnish; and, to the uppers, a mixture of 
four parts of lard to one of rosin. Apply while warm. 

To OET Light in a Well or Cistern.— Reflect it in by a looking-glass. 
Any steel or metal lost in a cistern may be drawn out by lowering a strong 
magnet.

pepner in their holes. 

fepors ON Varnished Furniture are readilv removed by rubbing them 
witli essence of peppermint or spirits of caniplior, and afterwards with "fur- 
niture polish" or oil. 

To Keep Seeds from the depredations of mice, mix some pieces of cam- 
phor with them. Camphor placed in trunks or drawers will prevent mice 
iroin doing them injury.

car. ile higher than the mouth in blowing it out. 

liME TO Cut Timber. — Hard wood for timber or tire-wood should be cut 
in August, September or October. Hoop-jwles should be cut before frost 
cotues: cut at other times, there is danger of worms. 

A Wet Silk Hat. — Shake off the water, rub the way the nap lies with 
a clean linen cloth or silk handkerchief, and hang some distance from the 
fire to dry; a few hours after, brush with a soft brush. 

To .MAKE Old Varnish Dry.— "Sticky " varnish may be dried by apply- 
ing a coat of benzine, and, after two or three days, apply a coat of good 
vaniish, and let dry thoroughly before using the furniture. 

DiscoLORATioNs ON CusTARD Cups.— To take the brown discolcratloiis off ot 



MISCELLAyEOUS. 663 

cups In whicli custards are baked : Rub with damp flannel dipped in best 
whiting. Scouring sand or sand soap will answer tlie purpose. 

To Preserve Steel Pens. — Steel pens are destroyed by corrosion from 
acid in the ink. Put in the ink some nails or old stvel i>ens, and the acid 
will exhaust itself on them, and the })ens in use will not corrode. 

To KEEP Russia Iron Pipe or Stoves during the summer: Give them a 
good coat of coal-oil all over, and put away m a dry place. In the fall 
givi' it a fresh coat of oil or benzine, and rub it all of! clean and dry. 

Buckeye Polish.— Take one ounce each shellac and coal -oil, half an 
ounce each linseed oil and turpentine, bottle and keep well corked, shake 
well before using and apply witn a sponge. Good for marred furniture. 

Fob Poultry.— Fish are an excellent food for poultry; largely increas- 
ing the production of eggs. Those who have tried the experiment have 
discarded all the patent egg-producing foods in the market, and feed iish. 

Wood — may be fastenea to stone with a cement made of four parts of 
pitch, four parts of pounded brick-dust or chalk, and one part of beeswax. 
Warm it before using, and apply a thin coating to the surfaces to be joined. 

Outbids Garments. — Bonnets, cloaks, hata, shawls, scarfs, and the like, 
will last clean and fresh much longer if the dust is carefully removed 
from them by brushing and shaking after returning from a ride or walk. 

New Rope may be made pliable by boiling it in water for a couple of 
hours. Its strength is not aiminished, but its stiffness is gone. It must 
hang in a warm room until thoroughly dried, and must not be allowed to 
kink. 

Razor Straps-— are kept in order by applying a few drops of sweet-oil. 
After nsing a strap, the razor takes a keen edge by passing it over the 
palm of the warm liand; dipping it in warm water also makes it cut more 
ieenly. 

Mica Windows in stoves (often wrongly called "isinglass"), when 
smoked, are readily cleaned by taking out and thoroughly washing with 
Tinegar a little diluted. If the black does not come olT at once, let it soak 
a little. 

Arrange Flat-irons on the stove in two rows, "heel and toe," or so 
that when ready for a hot flat you can take the next one in order without 
lc«s of time in trying or "sissing" them, being sure of getting the one that 
has been heated the longest. 

Chapped Hands.— Grind one side of a pumice stone ; wet, and, with the 
smooth side, rub the hands. If badly chapped, oil them at night, and dry 
in by the fire; or, at night, wet the hands, and rub a little honey over 
them, drying it in before the fire. 

Chickadees in Winter.— A cup of pumpkin-seeds, set on the window- 
rill, will attract chickadees, and they will become quite tame, and are very 
amusing with their antics. They may be kept about the house from Decem- 
ber to May by fee<ling and kind treatment. 

Shellac Varnish.— Put shellac in a bottle, pour 90 per cent, alcohol to 
cover, cork tight and put in a warm room, shake occasionally, and if not all 
dissolved in Uiree or four days, add more alcohol. This is good to varnisli 
almost any thing, and will dry in half an hour. 

Friction Matches— should never be left where the mice will get them, 
as they carry them to their nests, and sometimes ignite them. They are 
poison to children, and are dangerous to women, who ignite them by step- 
ping on them, and endangering their clothing from fire. 

To Prevent Pumps from Freezing. — Take out the lower valve in the 
iall, and drive a tack under it, projecting in such a way that it can not 

Suite close. The water will then leak back into the well or cistern, while 
le working qualities of the pump will not be damaged. 
Valuable Cement.— Two parts, by weiglit, of common pitch and one 
part gutta percha, melted together in an iron vessel, makes a cement that 
bolds together, with wonderful tenacity, wood, stone, ivory, leather, porc*- 
kln, silk, woolen or cotton. It is well adapted to aquariuma* 



664 MISCELLANEOUS, 

CncKifT FOR RuBBRR OR T<BATRER.— T)iSj)o1ve one ounc5e of ^utta percha 
in one-half pound chloroform. Clean the parts to be cemented ; cover each 
with solution, and let thcni dry twenty or thirty minutes; warm each part 
in the Hame of the candle, and press very firmly together ti.ll dry. 

Insurance. — Supixuje your Iwirn or house should take fire to-night and be 
burned down, would you know, witiiout investipatinp, that it was fully 
insured and that the pcilioy wius good and tight? S<jme insurance companies 
have a keen scent for flaws in {Hjliciesand oft4in find them. Don't let them 
ever find one in yours. Alwav-s insure in companies known to be sound. 

To MAKE OLD Paint dry. — Old paint which is "sticky" may be made 
hard and dry by applying a coat of l)cnzine, then after a day or two, if the 
coat of paint is good, go over it with a tliin coat of laquer mixed with one 
third of its bulk of l)oilcd oil. If paint is thin apply a second coat in which 
more laquer is used. 

To Re.vovate Hat-bands when Stained by Sweat. — Dissolve one and a 
half ounces white c&stite soap in four ounces alajhol and one ounc^. each of 
sulphuric ether and aqua ammonia, ap{>ly with a sponge or toothbrush, rub 
smartly, rinse out with clear rain-water. This is equally good to renovate 
anv cloth with fast color. 

To Thaw Out a PrMP. — Pour hot water directly on the ice, through a 
tin tube, lowering it as fast as the ice thaws. Ice may l)e thawed in this 
way at the rate of a foot a minute; while, by pouring hot water into the 

f>ump, the ice would hardly he affected, tlie hot water being lighter than 
he cold, and rising to the top. 

Water-proof Shoes. — To make slioes water-prr>of and make them last a 
long time, dissolve beeswax and add a little sweet-oil to thin it Before the 
shoes are w»orn, warm tlie soles and pour the melted wax on with a tea- 
spoon; and then hold it cl<»se to the fire till it soaks into the leather; then 
add more till the leather ceases to absorb it. 

Diamond Cement. — Dissolve thirteen ounces of white glue in a tin dish 
containing a pint and a half soft water (set in a kettle containing boiling 
water); when the glue is dissolve*!, stir in three ounces of white lead, and 
boil till well mixed; remove from fire, and, when cool, add half pint alco- 
hol ; bottle immediately, and keep well corked. 

A Good Paste. — To one pint cold water add two heaping table-spoons 
flour. Put the flour in a pan, add a little of the water, stirring until 
smooth; then add the rest of the water,* stir thoroughly, place on the 
stove and stir constantly until it Iwils. After taking fr6m' the stove, add 
one-fourth teaspoon ground cloves to keep it sweet. 

Piece- Baos. — While cotton piece-bags hung in the linen closet are a ^reat 
convenience; have them made with a string to draw from both sides: 
mark in large letters in indelible inki *' Merino and Cloth," "Cotton and 
Linen Sundries," *' Dress Pieces," "Old Linen," "Worsted and Yam," 
** Old Silk," "Thread and Tape," "Old Gloves," etc. 

To Remove White Spots on Fitrniturr, caused by a hot iron or hot 
water, or to rest-ore blistered furniture. — Rub with a No. 1 sand-paper some- 
what worn, or apply pulverized pumice stone mixed with a few drc^ of 
linseed oil, then with a cotton cloth rub on some shellac varnish thinned 
well with turpentine. Or. rub with spirits of camphor. 

Weight op Grain. — Wheat 60 pounds in all states except Connecticat, 
where it is 50; corn 56, except in New York, where it is .')8 ; oats 32; barley 
48; buckwheat 46 to 50, but generally 48; clover seed 60, but 64 in Ohio ana 
New Jersey; timothy 44; flaxseed 56; potatoes 60; beans 60, but in Ohio 
66, and New York 62; dried peaches 28 to .'i'i; drie<l apples 22 to 28. 

Unfermented Wink for CoM.MrNioN. — Weigh the grapes, pick from the 
stems, put in a i)orcelain kettle, add very little wat-er, and cook till stones 
and pulp separate; press and strain through a thick cloth, return juice 
to kettle, ana add three pounds sugar to every ten pounds grapes; heatta 
simmering, bottle hot, and seal. This makes one gallon, and is good. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 665 

To Soften Sponqes. — A sponge when first purchased is frequently hard, 
stiff and gritty. To soften it, and dislodge the particles of sea-sand from its 
crevices, having first soaked and squeezed it through several cold waters, put 
the sponge into a clean tin sauce-pan, set it over the fire, and boil it a quar- 
ter 01 an hour. Then take it out into a bowl of cold water, and squeeze it 
well. Wash out the sauce-pan, and return the sponge to it, filling up with 
clean, cold water, and boil it another quarter of an hour. Repeat the pro- 
cess, giving it three boils in fresh water, or more than three if you find it 
still gritty. Take care not to let it boil too long, or it will become tender 
and arop to pieces. 

Extras Thrown in. — To purify a room of unpleasant odors, bum vinegar, 
resin, or sugar; to make chicken gravy richer, add eggs found in chicken, or, 
if none, yolk of an egg; soak garden seeds in hot water a few seconds before 
planting ; to prevent cholera in chickens, put assafoetida in water they drink, 
and let them pick at coal ashes ; in using hard water for di.sh-water add a 
little milk ; to clean paint, add to two quarts hot water, two table-spoons tur* 
pentine and one of skimmed milk, and only soap enough to make suds, and 
It will clean and give luster ; iron rust on marble can generally be removed 
with lemon-juice ; a thin, coat of varnish applied to straw-matting makes it 
more durable and adds to' its beauty. 

Bologna Sausage. — ^Take equal portions of fresh pork, veal, and ham 
or salt pork, chop them fine or grind, and mix together thoroughly ; to nine 
pounds of the meat allow ten tea-spoons powderea sage, two each of ca3'enne 
and black pepper, one grated nutmeg, one teaspoon cloves, one minced 
onion, and sweet herbs to taste; mix well and stuff into beef intestines. 
(Wash tlie intestines thoroughly and cut them into lengths of two yards 
each ; turn inside out, and again wash thoroughly in warm water, scraping 
with a scraper made for this purpose ; throw into salt water to soak till used. 
Great care will be necessary in cleaning cases to avoid tearing them.) Tie 
up both ends of the bag tightly, prick in several places, and boil slowly 
for an hour ; then dry them m the sun, and hang them in a cool dry cellar, 
after rubbing the outside of the skins with melted butter. These are eaten 
without further cooking, and are very nice. 

614ACK FOR Woolens. — ^One ounce vitriol, one ounce extract logwood to 
two pounds goods ; color in iron. Di-ssolve the extract over night in warm 
water; pulverize the vitriol, put it into boiling water sufficient to cover the 
goods; wash the goods well, rinse in warm water, then simmer a few min- 
utes in vitriol wat^r ;' take out, wash thoroughly in clear water, then dip in 
boiling logwood dye till the color is good, stirring often and lifting u]) so it 
will get tlie air; dry, then wa'^h in a suds and rinse. In renovating black 
alpaca that has become rusty, di.ssolve the logwood onljr, as nothing is needed 
to set the color. Wash the goods well in suds, rinse, dip in logwood dye, boil 
a few minutes, stirring and lifting to air. When dry, wash again in sud.sand 
rinse in water in which a little gum arable has been dissolved, and press 
smoothly on the wrong side while damp. Dyed in this way the color will 
not rub off more tlian from new goods, and looks as good as new. When 
extract of logwood is used, it is only needful to boil enough to dissolve be- 
fore putting in the goods. 

The Cistern. — An abundant supply of good water is a necessity for every 
house, and capacious cisterns are a necessity. Two essential requisites are 
^ood hydraulic lime and clean pure sand. The hydraulic cement becomes 
ma few months as hard as sandstone, but the sand must never exceed two 
parts to one of lime. The cheapest form of cistern is simply a hole dugin 
the ground with sides sloping like those of a narrow bottomed tub. The 
water lime mortar is applied directly to these sides, the shape of the sides 
sustaining the mortar until it hardens. The breadth of such a cistern, if 
large, makes it difficult to cover, but this may be done with a plank sup- 
ported by strong scantling, over which should be placed earth to the depth 
of the lowest frost. There must be a hole through the covering, left for 



666 MISCELLANEOUS. 

cleaning, which should be curbed, and may admit the pump if the locality 
is right, or a pipe may go from cistern into cellar below the frost line, 
and thence to the kitchen. The mortar on the walls should never be leas 
than an inch thick, and they should have at least two coats, and three are 
better. As the mortar begins to dry in a very short time after qiixin^, it 
is best to mix the lime and sand dr^*, and apply water to small quantities 
at a time as needed. A mure capacious cistern may be made at a greater 
expense by digging a hole with per|>endicular walls, and laying walls of 
bnck in the form of the upper half of a barrel, on which to lay the mor- 
tar. This form has a smaller top, and is much more easily covered than 
the other. The wall should be laid as well as plastered with water-lime. 
A filtering attachment is made by building a small receiving cistern beside 
the larger one, with filtering apparatus between them, or a strong wall 
mav be built through the middle of the cistern, receiving the water in one 
division and filtering it through into the other. 

Limb-water and its Uses.— -rlace a piece of unslaked lime (size is imma- 
terial, as the water will take up only a certain quantity) in a perfectly clean 
bottle, and fill with cold water; keep corked in a cellar or cool dark place: 
it is ready for use in a few minutes, and the clear lime-water may be used 
whenever it is needed. When the water is poured off, add more; this may 
be done three or four times, after which some new lime must be used as 
at first A tea-spoon in a cup of milk is a remedy for children*s summer 
complaint; also for acidity of the stomach; when added to milk it has no 
unpleasant taste. When put into milk that would otherwise curdle when 
heated, it prevents its curlding, so that it can then be used for puddings 
and pies. A small quantity of it will prevent the *' turning" of cream and 
milk. It also sweetens and purifies bottles which have contained milk. 
Some add a cupful to a sponge of bread to prevent it from souring. 

The Lightning Rod. — When properly put up, the lightning rod is a per- 
fect protection ; but, when not seientificallv constructed, is only a source 
of danger. Tlie following are essentials: L It must extend seversil feet into 
the ground so as always to be in contact with rnoist earth, or into a never-failing 
supply of water; 2. It must be sfuirp at tlie top, and, if there are sevenu 
points, all the better; 3. It must be half as liigh above the top of the build- 
ing as the distance horizon ti« 11 y to ths most remote part of the roof of the 
building; 4. It should be large enough to convey off every discharge with- 
out being melted or broken ; 5. The best material is iron with copper 
below the surface of the ground, as iron ru.sts away rapidly in the moist 
earth. CopT)er is the best conductor, but costs more* and is not as stiff to 
withstand the wind. One-half to five-eighths of an inch in diameter is large 
enough. Bright points are not essential, and glass insulators are of no use 
whatever, as when wet they are good conductors, and, even if they were 
not a small charge even would leap across the short distance from the rod 
to the iron staple. The best way to fasten the joints, is to weld them, 
which any blacksmith can do, passing the rod through opposite doors of 
his shop, afterwards dragging it home. If the building is so high that it 
can not be readily put up in one piece, the best joint is made by screwing 
the two ends firmly into one nut The points are easily made by welding 
several smaller wires to the large one, and filing them sharp. A rod will 
protect a space the distance of which is four times the heignt of the rod. 
The cheapest and best support is wood. The only point to be considered is 
to secure the rod firmly. The round rods are the best If there are iron 
water-pipes or steam-pipes in the building, they should all be connected 
with tne liglitning rod, or directly with the moist earth, eight or ten feet 
below the surface. 

Canary Birds. — Do not keep in a room that is being painted or has odor 
of new paint Do not hang over a stove or grate which contains fire. Do 
not set the cage in a window, and shut it down upon it; the draft is injuri- 
oos. Do not wash cage bottom, but scrape clean with a knife, and then put 



MISCELLANEOUS. 667 

on some fresh gravel ; the moisture breeds red mites, and is injurious to the 
bird. Do not keep the birds you intend to breed in the spring together 
during the winter. Do not keep single birds in a room where others are 
breeding, or males and females in mating season in the same room in sepa- 
rate cages, as it is likely to cause mating fever. Feed canary on rape seed, 
but no lierap. For diarrhoea put a rusty piece of iron in dish water, changing 
water not ottener than twice a week, and oread boiled in milk as for asthma; 
boil well in this case, so tliat when cold it will cut like cheese; give freely 
with plenty of vegetables. 

Moulting is not a disease, yet during this season all birds are more or less 
aick. and some suffer severely. They require plenty of nourishing food. 
Worms, insects, and fruits to those which eat them ; and to those which 
live upon dry seeds, bread dipped in milk, fruit and vegetables. 

The German metallic-enameled cages are the best — white and green (a 
combination of) or a light chocolate are the best colors; they are not painted 
as are the cages made here in America, but the color is burnt into the wires. 
Avoid wooden or brass cages, also conical ** fountains " for food and drink ; 
for the latter, square or round cups of china or glass are the best. The 
perches should be plain, round, unvarnished sticks, and no two of the same 
size. Clean the cage thoroughly every morning. Prepare fresh, clean bath- 
ing and drinking water, and If sand is used on the bottom of cage, clean it 
(the sand) by boiling in water. Scrape the perches well, and twice a week 

f»lunge them in boiling water to kill any red mites that may have lodged 
here. Give plenty of seed, also green parts of manjr plants, such as poppy, 
rape, hemp, etc. ; also the seeds of weeas like the chickweed, plantain, etc., 
and the fresh, tender leaves of beets, cabbage and lettuce. Avoid fruits con- 
taining a large percentage of acid, but give occasionally a hard-boiled egg. 
Never give them sugar, but all the red pepper they will eat. It is the best 
thing for them. And if your bird feels hoarse at any time, put a piece of fct 
salt pork in the cage and see how the little follow will enjoy it. Give him 
flax-.seed once in a while, and if he appears dumpy occasionally give him a 
diet of bread and water, with red i>epper sprinkled in. 

For lice, cleanliness is the best preventive, l)ut not always .<»ure. For cure 
you have simply to cover your cage at night with a white cloth, rise early in 
the morning, remove the cloth and dip in scalding hot water. 

Bkd-Bugs. — To banish bed-bugs after they have grjt into the walls and 
ceilings of a house, close all doors and windows and burn brimstone, ly 
throwing it upon red hot coals in an irtju kettle set in the nii<ldle (»f tlio 
room. Or heat a })ie(e of iron red hot, plaer in a kettle, throw in tl'*' 
l)rinistone, and leave room closed for twenty-four h<ours. It is death to 
the vermin. 

To Cure a Burn. — Wot a cloth and sprinkle it with carbonate of .H)d;i 
(common cooking soda) and bind it on the burn. It quickly stops the i>ain, 
and is a harmless and thorough remedy. If no clotli is at hand, wet the 
part burned and sprinkle dry soda on it. 

Use of Borax. — Borax water will instantlv remove all soils and stains 
Irom the hands, and heal all scmtches and cliafes. To make it, put crudti 
borax into a large bottle and fill with water. When the borax is dissolved 
add more to the water, until at last the water can absorb no njore, and a 
residuum remains at the bottom of the bottle. To the water in which the 
hands are to be washed pour from this bottle enough to make it very 
soft. It is very cleansing and healthy. By its use the hands will be kept 
in excellent condition — soft, smooth and white. 

Uses of Charcokl. — Charcoal laid flat while cold on a bum, cause the 
pain to abate immediately ; by leaving it on for an hour the burn seems 
almost healed when the wound is superficial. Tainted meat surrounded 
with it, is sweetened. Strewn over heaps of decomposed pelts, or over dead 
animals, charcoal prevents any unpleasant odor. Foul water is purified 
by it. It is a great disinfectant, and sweetens offensive air if placed in 
BfiaUow trays around apartments. It is so very porous that it absorbs and 



668 MISCELLANEOUS. 

condenses gasses rapidh'. One cubic inch of fresh charcoal will abaorb one 
hundred inches of gaseous aninionia. Charcoal forms an excellent poultice 
for malignant wounds and st)rca. In cases of what is called proud flesh 
it is invaluable. It gives no disagreeable o<lor, cornnles no metal, Jiurts no 
texture, injures no color, is a simple and safe sweetener and disinfectant, 
A teaspoonful of charcoal, in half a glass of water, often relieves a sick 
headache. It absorbs the ^cs and relieves the distended stomach press- 
ing iigainst the nerves, which extend from the stomach to the heaa. It 
often relieves constipation, pain or heart disease. 

Lime in Ca.ns. — Lime ground and pulverize<i for white-washing pur- 
poses is put in cans and sold by druggists. It is convenient in form and 
excellent. 

To cLE.v.\ A BROWN poKCELAi.v KETTLE^ boil i)eoled potatocs in it. The 
porcelain will lie rendered nearly as white as wnen new. 

To Make Shoes Durable.— A coat of ^um copal varnish applied to the 
soles of boots and shoes, and re])eated as it dries until the pores are titled 
and the surface shines like polished mahogony, will make tlie soles water- 
proof, and make them last three times as Ion;;. 

Ebonizinu Wood. — Wash any close-grained wood with a strong boiling 
decoction of logwood two or three times, allowing the wood to dry between 
the api)lications. Then wash with a solution of acetrate of iron (made by 
dissolving iron tilings in strong vinegar). 

To Remove Rust keom a Stovepipe. — Rub with linseed oil (a little goes 
a great way); build a slow fire till it is dry. Oil in the Spring to prevent 
it from rusting. 

To C'uRB A RicKiNO Cow. — Take a strap an inch wide and buckle tight 
around each hind leg, just above the hock, tight enough to slightly compress 
tiie ham-string. Then she can not kick. In fly time take in the tail with the 
leg and you will not swear. 

Handles. — Knife and fork handles that have become loosened may be fast- 
ened by taking a piece of quill, putting it into the handle, and pushing the 
knife or fork in firmly, after first heating it. 

How TO Detect Poison Ivy. — The poison ivv and the innocuous kind differ 
in one particular which is too easy of remembrance to be overlooked by any 
•ne who is interested enough in the brilliant-hued leaves of autumn to care 
lor gathering them ; the leaves of the former grow in clusters of threes, and 
those of the latter in fives. As somebody has suggested in a juvenile stoiy 
book, every child should be taught to associate the five leaves in a cluster 
with tlie fingers on the human hand, and given to understand that when 
these numbers agree they can be brought into contact with perfect safety. It 
■lay spare our readers no little suffering to bear this point in mind during 
their October rambles in the fields. 

To Cure Worms in Horses. — Put a handful of sifted wood ashes in a quart 
bottle, and fill the bottle with cider vinegar. It will foam like soda water. It 
should be given to the horse the moment it foams. Two bottles will cure the 
worst case of worms. Forty years' experience attests the efficiency of this. 
Never known to fail. 

Harmonious Color' Contrasts. — The following list of harmonizing colors 
will be found very useful in selecting wall decorations or colors for any pur- 
pose : Red with green, blue with orange, yellow with violet, black with wami- 
orown, violet with pale-green, violet with light-rose, deep blue with golden- 
brown, chocolate with light blue, deep red with gray, maroon with wami- 
green, deep blue with pink, chocolate with pea-green, maroon with deep bine, 
olaret with buff, black with warm-green. 

Branches of the elder-bush hung in the dining-room of a house, will clear 
the room of flies. There is an odor which the insects detest. 

To Clean Loo king -r* lasses. — Keep for this purpose a piece of sponge, a 
cloth, and a silk handkerchief, all entirely free from dirt, as the least grit will 
scratch the flne surface of the glass. First sponge it with a little spirits of 



MISCELLANEOUS. 669 

v:ine, ^n-and- water, so as to clean off all spots; then dust over it powder 
blue, tied in muslin, rub it liehtly and quickly off with the cloth, and 
finish by rubbing it with the silk handkerchief. Be careful not to rub Uie 
edges or the frame. 

An Easy Way to Clean Silver Articles. — Set fire to some wheat-straw, 
collect the ashes, and, after powdering it, sift it through muslin. Polish 
the silver plate witli a little of it applied to some soft leather. 

Freckle Cure. — Take 2 oz. lemon juice, or half a dram of powdered borax, 
and one dram of sugar ; mix together, and let them stand in a glass bottle for 
a few days, then rub on the face occasionally. 

Yankee Shavino Soap. — ^Take 3 lbs. white bar soap; 1 lb. Castile soap; 

1 quart rain water; % qt. beef's ^11 ; 1 gill spirits of turpentine. Cut the soap 
into thin slices, and boil five minutes after the soap is dissolved, stir while 
boiling; scent with oil of rose or almonds. If wished to color it, use ]^ oz. 
vermilion. 

Bloom of Youth. — Boil 1 ounce of Brazil wood in 3 pints of water for 1$ 
minutes ; strain. Add % oz. isinglass % oz. cochineal, 1 oz. alum, }4 oz. 
borax. Dissolve by heat, and strain. 

Cologne Water. — Oils of rosemary and lemon, of each % oz.; oils of ber- 
gamotand lavender, each H oz.; oil cinnamon, 8 drops; oils of cloves and 
rose, each 15 drops; best deodorized alcohol, 2 qts.; shake two or three times 
per day for a we^. 

To Clean Old Marble. — Take a bullock's gall, 1 gill soap lees, half a gill 
of turi>entine ; make into a paste with pipeclay, apply it to the marble ; let 
it dry a day or two, and then rub it off, and it will appear equal to new ; if 
very dirty, repeat the application. 

To EXTRACT Oil from Marble or Stone. — Soft soap, 1 part ; fullers' -earth, 

2 parts ; potasli, 1 part ; boiling water to mix. Lay it on the spots of grease, 
and let it remain for a few hours. 

The best Kat Trap. — Rats are very sharp to spy out traps. Any trap that 
has caught one without being deodorized is not likely to catch another, and 
old ones are hard to catch by any sort of trap. The best method, however, 
is to till a common wash boiler one-third full of water, and sprinkle over the 
surface a few handfuls of oats. These will float on the surface and look 
like a tempting feast, but the rat that ventures in is drowned. By placing a 
block of wood 111 the center large enough to fioat.one rat, its cries will often 
call more in. This trap will prove effective when others fail. 

To Renew Stained Fix)ors— that have ^rown a little dull, rub thoroughly 
with beeswax and turi)entine. Rei>cat this whenever they need it. 

To Clean Varnished Furniture, there is nothing so good as a woolen rag 
dampened in spirits of turpentine. This takes all the dust and cloud from 
carvings and panels. When they have been thoroughlv cleaned with the 
turpentine, go over the surface again with a bit of flannel dipped in linseed 
oil, rubbing it well into the wooci. 

Cows and Turnips. — To prevent the odor and flavor of turnips from ap- 
pearing in the milk, feed while milking, and the flavor will have disappejired 
before the next milking. With this precaution, feeding turnips will increase 
the flow without injuring the quality or flavor of milk. 

Care of a Carriage. — A carnage should be kept in a dry coach-house, with 
a moderate amount of light, otherwise the colors will be destroyed. There 
should be no comniunication between the stables and the coach-house. 
The manure heap or pit should ahso be kept as far away as possible. Am- 
monia cracks varnish and fades the colors noth of painting and lining. In 
washing a carriage, keep out of the sun and u.*<e plenty of water which 
apply with a large, soft sponge. This, when saturated, squeeze over the 

{)anels, and by the flow down of the water the dirt will soften and harm- 
esslv run off, then finish with a soft chamois leather and old silk hand- 
kerchief. Never ase a brush, which, in conjunction with the grit from the

road, acts like sand-paper on the varnish, scratching it, and of course 
effectually removing all gloss. Never allow water to dry itself on the car- 
riage as it invariably leaves stains. 

The F.\mily Cow.— The best cows are usually the thinnest ones and the 
largest eaters. The wanner the stable is kept the less food will she require. 
Linseed oil-cake meal gives a greasy, unpleasant flavor, and light color to 
butter. Winter and Sj)ring butter is often injured in flavor by allowing 
cows Ui out the litter from horse stables. 

To Frkshen Old Hickory Nuts for Cake Making.— -Put large ones in 
Ixiiling water for half an hour and small ones for a quarter hour, crack, 
pick out meats being careful not to mix in any pieces of shell or the fihn 
iliat divides the two halves, If the meats seem damp, place for a few 
momenta in the oven to dry out. Now place in a sieve and rub gently to 
remove all the dark portions that adhere to the meat«, and they are ready 
to be chopped for the cake. Chop very fine for icings, but only moder- 
utely flne tor cake. 

To Ascertain Amount or 
Gas Used.— Read from left- 
hand dial, always taking the 
figures which the index hands 
have paffled, viz.: By these 
dials, register 436 adding two 
ciphers for the hundredths, 
making 43,60) feet registered.

Hydrophobia and rrs Symptoms. — The following valuable hints regarding 
the symptoms of that terrible disease, hydrophobia, are from a lecture de- 
livered in St. Paul, by the Rev. E. C. Mitchell, of that city : 

" The |>eriod of actual danger begins before it is generally suspected. 
Hydrophobia is contagious, but it is communicated by actual contact 
only. The saliva of the rabid animal must enter the aW)rbent8 of the 
body of the victim. Any living l>eing which has the hydrophobia can 
communicate it to others. Carniverous animals are most liable to hj'dro- 
phobia. Herbivorous animals are less dangerous, because they do not gen- 
erally attack with their teeth. We will consider the disease as it develops 
in the dog. The dog does not at once become furious. The disease is grad- 
\ial. At first the dog feels uneasy and likes to be petted. It is an im- 
portant i)oint that, from the verv beginning of the disease, the saliva of 
the animal is a deadly poison, ftis caresses are as dangerous as his bite. 
If tiie siiliva of tiie animal comes in contact with anv broken place on the 
skin, death may result to the victim. Symptoms o? hydrophobia: 1. In 
the outward appearance: the dog becomes sad, dull and retired. He crawls 
into a corner, or hides. He is uneasy. He arouses with a start, changes 
position, and lies down, but he can not rest. He is agitated, yet sad. 
There is a marked change in his disposition. He is already dangerous, 
but he is not dis|K)sed to bite. His unea-siness increases. He scratches 
his bed, turns it over, smells about the room, under the doors, etc., as 
though looking for something. He is a victim of hallucination. He snaps 
at imaginary things in the air. As he ^rows worse, he runs furiously 
against a wall, or fence, and howls. He is not yet quarrelsome toward 



MISCELLANEOUS, 671 

the family. A. familiar voice will often restore him to his senses. He is 
still affectionate. Th^ more he suffers, the more he seeks relief in his 
master's caresses. The family, thinking the poor dog is sick, caress him. 
But this saliva is now fatal to human life if it enters the absorbents. Only 
in the last stages of the disease does the dog become furious and aggress- 
ive. 2. Symptoms affecting the digestive organs : Mad dogs do not always 
avoid water; many will drink water eagerly. In late stages of the disease 
a contraction of the throat renders them unable to drink. Even then they 
will often try to drink. Some rabid dogs lose their appetite, but others 
€at as usual' or even more than usual. Many rabid dogs will tear and 
swallow every thing thry can get into their mouths. We ought to suspect a 
dog that persistently bites at and swallows things unfit for food ; except in 
case of pups, which playfully bite every thing. It is supposed that mad 
dogs always ' froth at the mouth.' This is a mistake. They ' froth ' during 
the paroxysms only. But they are equally dangerous at other times. 
Sometimes the lower jaw is paralyzed an4 hangs oj^en ; the mouth 
becomes dry, dark red, and covered with brown spots; the eyes are 
dull and gloomy ; the dog can not bite, but his saliva may fall upon 
persons. The master may think the dog has a bone in his throat and 
may try to extricate it. But this is highly dangerous. The dog often vom- 
its blood from wounds in the stomach, made by swallowing* various sharp 
articles. The master may incautiouslv try to help the dog, and may be bit- 
ten, or may come in contact with the ^og's saliva, which may enter some cut 
or scrat^'h on the hand. 3. Symptoms in the voice: The bark of a mad-dog 
is peculiar. The voice is generally weaker than usual, and hoarse and sad. 
The dog does not fully close his jaws after each bark. In 'dumb madness.* 
the dog loses his voice. 4. Symptoms as to nervous sensibility : A mad-dog 
is much less sensitive to pain, often even indifferent to severe burning or 
cutting. We ought to suspect every dog that is unnaturally insensible Ut 
pain, especially if he bites him.self severely. A mad-<log, however quiet, will 
suddenly grow fierce when he sees another dog. The rabid animal is reck- 
lessly brave. Chain a suspected dog and show him another dog; if he be- 
comes furious, kill him. Mad-dogs often run away from home, at a late stage 
of the disease, and go to some lonely place, to die. But if chased they will 
return home. Then there is great danger that the unsuspecting family will, 
from sympathy, receive their lost dog with open arms, to learn, too late, that 
he is rabia. Suspect every such dog, and close the doors against him ; and, 
if possible, shoot him. It is important to discover hydrophobia during its 
early stages, before it is too late. Watch the habits of animals, esj>ecially 
dogs, and chain them securely when showing unusual symptoms. 

"Symptoms of confirmed rabies, or madness; The eyes have a sad, dull, 
yet fierce expression. Periods of excitement and of stupor alternate. Par- 
oxysms generallj' follow some exciting cause. Every healthy dog has an in- 
stinctive dread of a rabid dog. Powerful and fierce dogs will flee from very 
small rabid dogs; they seem to instinctively know their danger. This is a 
good test of a (log's condition. Bring other dogs into his presence, and if 
they all avoid him his ca.*<(' is very suspicious. After the di.^-case has herome 
confirmed, the dog runs along at first, in a natural gait, attacking every thing 
he meets, especially dogs. But he becomes exhausted, and runs slowly, and 
staggers. His head and tail hang down. Tliis is the generallv recognized 
condition of mad-dogs, but it is only the last stage. The dog falKs, and appa- 
rently sleeps. But after rest, if aroused, he will run again, and will attack. 
But if not disturbed he will die from paralysis and asphyxitu 

"The cat sometimes has hydrophonia; and then she is a perfect fury. 
Her feline nature shows itself:* She is so quick she is very dangerous. Her 
eyes are wild ; her hair stands up, and her jaws are open. In later stages she 
will crawl under .«<omething and die. Whenever a cat grows restless, without 
apparent cause, or is sad and stupid, biting at her bed, and at other things, 
it IS time to put her out of the way. 



672 MISCELLANEOUS. 

** Animals do not 00 mad any more in Sommer than in Winter. There are 
as many road animalB in cold ooantriea as in warm conntries. HnzzHn^ 
4og8 in Summer is unnecessary ; in fact it la a damage to them, by prevent- 
ing free perspiration through the tongue. 

" In human beings less than half of those who are bitten by mad-dogs ever 
have hydrophobia. But very few, if any, in whom the disease is actually 
developed ever recover. In most cases the disease is manifested within two 
months itfter the bite, and nearly aU the cases have come within three 
roonthfi, but there are a few cases recorded which developed much longer 
after the bite. The disease, when developed, generally lasts from one to fouf 
days. Bites on the unprotected parts of the body are naturally more daii' 
^reroiis. as, on the covered parts, the clothing may absorb the saliva of the 
r ibid animal." 

To MAKE HsN8 Lay IN W INTER. — Keep them warm; keep corn con- 
stantly by them, but do not (eed it to them. Feed tlietti with meat scraps 
when lanl or taliow lias iK'en tried, or fresh meat. SSoiiie chop preen pep- 
pers tinely, or mix cayenne pepi)er with corn-meal, to feed them. Let 
them have a frequent taste of green food, a little gravel and lime, or clam- 
shells. 

To Remove Oil Marks from wall paper where inconsiderate people rest 
their heada Take pipe-clay or fiiller*s earth, and make into a paste, about 
as thick as ice-cream, with cold water; Ia>r it on the stain gently without 
rubbing it in ; leave it on all night. It will be dry by morning, when it 
•an be brushed otf, and unless an old stain, the grease spot will have dis- 
appeared. If old, renew the application. 

Contexts op (.'iktern. — The lol lowing gives the contents of a cistern for 
each f(K»t in depth. If the diameter at to^ and bottom differ, strike the

Stove Polish. — Add to one pint benzine, one ounce pulverised resin; 
when dissolved, mix any grxxl and Hn^iy ground black lead, using the above 
just the same as you would water for mixing stove polish. Applj' with a 
small paint brush, and rub it smooth, as it dries rapidly; when dry, polish 
with a soft stove brush; very little rubbing is required. For sheet-iron 
«se the benzine and resin alone, apply with soft rags, and rub rapidly until 
dry and shining. 

To Keep Silk. — Silk goods should not be folded in white paper, as the 
chloride of lime used in bleaching the paper will impair the color of the 
silk. Brown or blue paper is better; yellow India paper is better still. 
Silk intended for dress snould not be kept in the house long, as lying 
In folds cau.ses it to crack or split, particularly if thickened with gum. 
White satin dresses should be pinned up in blue paper, with coarse brown 
pa]>er on the outside, sewed together on the edge. 

To KEEP PAiNT-BRUSHfcB. — TuHi a ucw brusli bristlcs up, open, pour in a 
spoonful of good varnish, and keep in that ])osition until dry, and the bris- 
tles will never " shed" in painting. The varnish also keeps it from shrinking 
niul falling to pieces. As soon as a job is finished, wipe brush dean, wrap 
in piece of paper, and hang it in a small deep vessel containing oil, letting 
the brush de.scend into the oil up to the wrapping cord. This will keep 
painting and varnish bruslies clean and ready for use. 

Stammering. — If not caused by malformation of organs, reading aloud, 
with the teeth closed, for at least two liours u day for three or four months 
will cure stammering.

▼aluable points embodied in this b(K)k, to " Care of the ^ick ; " " Accidents and Emer- 
gencies; •' " Health Hints," published by Cowan & Co., New York; ''In the Kitchen***

Wliat Well Known Iiadies of the Sonth Think 

of ''Dixie Cook Book/' 



State of Alabama, > 

Executive Office, Montgomery. ) , September 1, 1888. 

I have carefully perused the *'Dbde Gook Book** and And it to ba 
more entertaining, useful and instructiye than any work of the kind I 
have ever read. I have examined many books of this kind, and have no 
hesitation in saying this is the best I have ever seen, and I am sure that 
every woman who has used it will concur with me in this opinion. 

Very Respectfully, Omvia M. O'Neal. 

(Wife of Gov. O'Neal, of Alabama.) 



I would certainly advise all young housekeepers to give the ''Dixie 
Cook Book" a trial, and older ones will find many valuable lessons in it. 

Very Respectfully, Mrs. Joseph E. Bbown. 
Atlanta, Ga., April 11, 1888. 



Nashville, May 29, 1888. 
X. A CloTkMThy AtlarUa^ Oa.: 

Your valuable and interesting "Dixie Cook Book" has afforded me 
much pleasure and profit I would commend it to every new housekeeper 
as a 49uitable text book and may it cause many happy hours, (as it will if 
its precepts are followed,) is the wish of 

Mbb. W. B. Bates. 
(Wife of Gov. Bates, of Tennesee.) 



The '^Dixie Cook Book*' is a new compilation on domestic economy 
which is enough to make the heart of every good housekeeper glad ; and 
the housekeeper who is not good, thankful. It is far more than its name 
indicates and should rather have been called "A Cyclopedia of Domestic 
Economy,** for it does a great deal more than confine itself to the mere 
matter of food and its preparation. It has reference to the proper man- 
agement of the entire household, the drawing room, library and bedroom 
as well as dining room, kitchen and cellar. It has regulations for the san^ 
itary welfare of the family, and wise counsel for the treatment of disease 



— 3 — 

and accident In short, as we said, it treats of the circuit of domestic lir- 

ing, and therefore is entitled to the larger and more dignified name 

which we have suggested for it Any housekeeper who 'will stady this 

book thoroughly, practice its recipes, and be governed by its hundreds of 

reliable maxims, wil '• be better fortified to meet all the demands exacted 

by a well ordered jnenage than if the concentrated wisdom of a ^eneratlaa 

of grandmothers, mothers and aunts of housekeeping celebrity, irere st 

her side to direct her. 

Maboabet J. Pbestox. 
Lexington, Virginia, August 1, 1883. 



Some four months ago I received the "Dixie CSook Book" * * 

I examined the work very carefully and was delighted with it. I then 
turned it over to Miss Linton, who has charge of our cooking department 
She was charmed with the b<x)k and has used it constantly. * * Every 
pupil in that department expresses a desire to have the book for herself. 

Yours Respectfully, M. Rutherford. 
Sept 26, 1883. Principal of '*Lucy Cobb Institute, Athens, Oa. 



This is to certify that I have used the 'Dixie Cook Book" in the cook* 
ing department of the *'Lucy Cobb" Institute,and it has been entirely satia- 
factory. * * You will see by date of foregoing testimonial that 
It was T^Titten some time ago, and I t bought had been sent I regret the 
delay as it gives me much pleasure to bear testimony to so excellent a 
publication. 

Respectfully, AmaB E. Linton. 
Superintendent of Cooking Department in "Lucy Cobb" Institute. 
Athens, Ga., October 80, 1883. 



It affords me sincere pleasure to commend most earnestly and cordially 
the contents of a volume which I hope will find a niche in every Ameri* 
can library. Judicious eclecticism has arranged in this book all that 
housekeepers could desire or require, and it constitutes a valuable Domestic 
Thesaurtu, which all women, especially wives and mothers, should possess. 
With best wishes for Its circulation and success, I am 

Respectfully, Augusta E. Wiuon. 

Mobile, Alabama, May 17, 1883. 



After using the "Dixie Cook Book" for several months, I most cor> 

dially and heartily recommend it to all housekeepers. It Is full of all 

kinds of Information, not only in the culinary department, but in house- 

eeplng^ and even in fine suggestions for decorating and furnishing. I 

find it to be the housekeeper's encyclopedia, giving varied and valuable 



— 8 — 

Inf onnation on all subjects from the culinaiy department to the parlor, nol 
omitting the "apothecary's shop" which is alone worth the price of the book.

Thb DmB Cook Book. 

Having given this book a thorough examination for several months 
and a full trial of many of its recipes, I do not hesitate to pronounce it the 
most complete and perfect book of the kind I have ever seen. I have id- 
lowed some time to elapse since receiving it, that a careful examination 
and trial of its contents would enable me to i^Tite intelligently of its value. 
Every housekeeper should have a copy, as they will find invaluable infor- 
mation in every department Tiie suggestions and instructions ^ven in 
Che arrangement of the kitchen and dining room are a great addition to 
the recipes which are all good and have the great advantage of being sim- 
ple and economical. Indeed I find it impossible to express my full appre- 
ciation of this book, which, in all its departments, seems to me to be inde- 
spensable to every housekeeper. Respectfully, 

Mrs. Henby W. Grady.

• * * I have used the "Dixie" for about one year and take pleas- 
Tire in testifying to its merits. I have "Marion Harland's Common Sense 
in the Household," Housekeeping in the Blue Grass," "Mrs. Hill's," and 
others too numerous to mention, but I use none but the "Dixie," as I have 
found it unfailing and It has everything a housekeeper needs. Indeed, I 
rarely go to my kitchen without it, as I find it not only reliable but eco- 
nomical. Mrs. J. G. Earnest.

I have very carefully examined and am very much pleased \Fitii jovr 
"Dixie Cook Book." Even for those already expert in the art of excellent 
and healthful cooking in all its many secrete of success, tlie "Dixie Cook 
Book" will prove to be the most valuable guide, reminder and referee. 
To the inexp<»rt it will become the most copiously informed and speediest 
teacher "love or money" can procure, for I find that its handsome pages 
contain and combine tlie cream of the culinary knowledge and experience 
of a thousand veterans of the pantry, the kitchen and the household. I 
hope it will have a great sale among our Southern homes. It decidedly 
deserves a gilded niche in every well ordered kitchen. I find it also a 
very valuable guide and adviser in social, domestic, medical and house- 
hold affairs. Replete with rare and reliable recipes, it covers a wide field of 
study and practical experience. Its medical part, well studied, will often 
save great pain as well as tlie physician's fee. I heartily conunend the 
"Dixie Cook Book" to every Southern household, for though I have kept 
house for nearly thirty years and used many cook books, I have never 
used one that pleased me as much in all respects as the ''Dixie Cook 
Book." Mbs. Wm. Henry Peck.

I have used this book about one year and consider it the very best 
and most economical of all cook books I have ever examined, and I think 
I have tried almost every one that was worth it.

I have used this book for almost two years and I unhesitatingly pnv 
nomice it the best I have ever seen. Not a single failure have I known 
to be made from any recipe, if carefully followed.

I have three or four cook books, but find the "Dixie** the best of all, 
and would advise all who care for a good work on cookery to get this 
^Dixie.** LOUT Habbibob.
