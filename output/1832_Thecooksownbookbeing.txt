PREFACE. 



THE cook exercises a greater power over the public health and 
welfare than the physician, and if he should be a charlatan in his art, 
alas ! for his employers. Hitherto, or until of late years, the cook 
has had to educate himself, while the physician appropriates all the 
knowledge of antiquity, and of every succeeding age; his individual 
cases are all classed according to general principles, while the rules 
that have regulated the preparation of our food, have been discordant 
and unnatural. In the present age, indeed, cookery has been raised 
to the dignity of an art, and sages have given their treatises to the 
world. Very has a monument in the cemetery of Pre La Chaise, 
among the tombs of warriors, poets, and philosophers, recording of 
his life that 'it was consecrated to the useful arts.' Virgil however, 
writes that the best delights of Elysium were showered upon those 
who received wounds for their country, who lived unspotted priests, 
who uttered verses worthy of Apollo, or who, like V3ry, consecrated 
their lives to the useful arts. On the utilitarian principle the cook 
should be much elevated in public estimation, and were he to form a 
strict alliance with the physician, the patriarchal ages would return, 
and men would die of nothing but sheer old age. 

After insanity, the most grievous affliction of Providence, or rather 
of improvidence and imprudence, is Dyspepsy : a malady that under 
different names has decimated the inhabitants of civilized countries, 
and of almost all countries, in which man is a 'cooking dnimal.' To 
the dyspeptic, the sun has no cheering ray, the air no elasticity or 
balm ; the flowers are without fragrance, music is without melody, 
and beauty without charms. Life is a blank ; affection has lost its 
power to soothe, and the blessings scattered by Providence, are con- 
verted into ministers of torment. Food becomes a bane ; the very 
staff that supports life, gives the flagellation that renders life a curse. 
All that can delight is lost, but all that can depress and sting, has a 
tenfold activity and power. 



IV PREFACE. 

\ 

The dyspeptic's ' May of life, has fallen into the sear, the yellow 
leaf.' Sleep that should visit every pillow but that of guilt, is to him 
no friend ; if he slumbers, it is to dream, like Clarence, of hideous 
forms of suffering, and to wake to their reality. This is but a faint 
picture of Dyspepsy. 

' Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene, 
Shades every flower and darkens every green, 
Deepens the murmur of the falling floods, 
And breathes a browner horror on the woods.' 

This malady is beyond the science of the physician, but within the 
art of the cook ; in the proverb, Doctor Diet is ranked above Doctor 
Quiet and Doctor Merryman ; though all are good. 

The late Mr. Abernethy referred almost all maladies to the stom- 
ach, and seldom prescribed any remedy but a proper diet. This it is 
the province of the cook to provide ; and the design of this book to 
indicate. The work is not designed to spread a taste for pernicious 
luxuries: and every recipe has been sanctioned by custom. The 
responsibility of the cook is lightened, and his duty facilitated. He 
has here a dictionary of reference, an encyclopedia of his art. The 
details are full, and the authority is perfect. There were various 
works of merit that it was useful for the cook to study, but here are 
collected ihe best parts of all, with the convenience of alphabetical 
arrangement, and in the compass of a moderate volume. If it is a 
sin to waste the best gifts of Providence, it should be little less than 
a felony to spoil them. When we have collected the materials for a 
house, we never trust the building to an unskilful architect: yet we 
are often obliged to commit the preparation of our feasts as well as 
of our common food, to agents without knowledge. This knowledge 
is now supplied. 

More than health depends on the proper preparation of food : our 
very virtues are the creatures of circumstances, and many a man has 
hardened his heart, or given up a good resolution, under the operation 
of indigestion. Who that knows the world, ever solicits with confi- 
dence a friendly or charitable act of another before dinner. 

The natural and moral world are reciprocally dependent ; soul and 
body are so linked, that when one loses its tone the other is deprived 
of its equanimity. The system of morals therefore becomes identi- 
fied with that of cookery, and the great English moralist, who was 
learned in both systems, thus spoke of the connexion ; ' Some peo- 
ple ' said Doctor Johnson, ' have a foolish way of not minding, or of 
pretending not to mind, what they eat. I for my part mind my belly 
very studiously, and very carefully, and I look upon it that he who 
does not mind his belly will hardly mind any thing else.' 



PREFACE. V 

It has been the study of the author, to make every recipe plain, 
and the proportions certain ; little is left to discretion, that could be 
reduced to measure. The system of confectionery is perfect ; and if 
strictly followed every cook may become a first rate confectioner. 
Labor, care, and expense have been bestowed upon the work, and the 
publishers feel so secure of its merit, and of the public want of such a 
took, that they have caused it to be stereotyped. This would have 
been hazardous with a novel or almost any literary work ; but the 
n umber of those who eat is far greater than of those who read. A 
good book few can estimate; all can enjoy a good dinner, and the 
publishers anticipate a proportionate encouragement. 

Having devised this work for families, we hope that it may offend 
no one, that we give a word of counsel to domestics: our book may 
be every way good, yet will its usefulness be much impaired if do- 
mestics are not docile and faithful. 

We have fortunately, in this country, but one class of people : all 
are free, and all are politically equal. Our domestics are in New 
England designated as help, to indicate that they are the equals, and 
assistants, rather than the inferiors of their employers. Yet the 
feeling of independence may be carried too far, and it may be ungra- 
ciously expressed. There is no disgrace, and there should be no 
shame in filling well a subordinate station; the hired ploughman, 
maid, or cook are not, in an offensive sense, any more the servants of 
their employers, than the merchant and the lawyer. All these engage 
to perform certain services for an equivalent, and it is the duty of all 
to do them faithfully. 

The number of domestics is very large perhaps the average is 
five to four families and it may be even greater. Yet, unfortunate- 
ly for their welfare, interest, or character, they are almost constantly 
shifting, and in few families do they remain long. In England, a 
good domestic is often provided for during life, and it is a desirable 
situation. It might be so here, if our domestics would strive to ac- 
commodate themselves to their situation. There is hardly a family, 
in which a kind, respectful, and faithful domestic might not be retained 
for years, and at the best wages. Here then is a home, comfort, and 
friends. Yet the greater number are contented to live a few month.* 
in a place, till the best years of life have slipped away, without pro- 
vision for age, and without friends, or home. The proverb of the 
rolling stone contains the best lesson for domestics. 

Service in any department is no sacrifice of independence. A 
domestic is in all things as free as any other class, but it is ,. 
bad kind of independence that would lead one, when desired to do .

thing in the line of a common employment, to do it ungraciously, 
and rather as an irksome or unjust task, than as a duty. 

Minor vexations, frequently repeated, are equal to greater individ- 
ual calamities ; as many small enjoyments constitute much of the 
pleasures of life. Around the social board every member of the fam- 
ily is collected thrice at least in twenty-four hours. Thither the 
head of the family returns from the labors or cares of his business to 
recruit his strength and to relax his mind. If he return to a table 
constantly and invariably ill spread ; to a dinner to which he could 
invite no friend, and in which he can have no enjoyment; a cloud 
will gather on the calmest brow, and a feeling of dissatisfaction may 
be extended to other things. It is not beneath the solicitude of a 
good wife, who would not suffer any abatement in the affection of 
which she is the object, diligently to study this book, and constantly 
to provide a neat and well dressed repast.

MANAGEMENT OF FAMILIES. 



IN* domestic arrangement the table is entitled to no small share 
of attention, as a well r.in<lurt<'tl <v-tem of domestic management 
is the foundation of ev< r\- comfort; and the respectability and 
welfare of families depend in a great measure on the prudent 
conduct of the female, whose province it is to manage the domes- 
tic concerns. 

Hmvever the fortunes of individuals may support a large expen- 
diture, it will be deficient in all that can benefit or grace society, 
and in every thing essential to moral order and rational happiness, 
if not conducted on a regular system, embracing all the objects 
of such a situation. 

In domestic management, as in education, so much must depend 
on the particular circumstances of every case, that it is impossibly 
to lay d )\> 11 a svstem which can be generally applicable. 

The immediate plan of every family must be adapted to its own 
peculiar situation, and can only result from the good sense and 
early good habits of the parties, acting upon general rational 
principles. 

What one family is to do, must never be measured by what 
another family does. Each one knows its own resources, and 
should consult them alone. What might be meanness in one, 
might be extravagance in another, and therefore there can be no 
standard of reference but that of individual prudence. The most 
fatal of all things to private families, is to indulge an ambition to 
make an appearance above their fortunes, professions, or business, 
whatever these may be. 

The next point, both for comfort and respectability, is, that all 
the household economy should be uniform, not displav ing a parade 
of show in one thing, and a total want of comfort in another. Be- 
sides the contemptible appearance that this must have to every 
person of good sense, it is productive of consequences, not only of 
present, but future injury to a family, that are too often irreparable. 

In urea! cities in particular, how common is it that for the vani- 
ty of having a showy drawing-room to receive company, the family 
are confined to aclose'back room, where they have scarcely either 
air or light, the want of which must materially prejudice their 
health. 

To keep rooms for show, where the fortune is equal to having 
a hou~e that will accommodate the family properly, and admit of 
this also, belongs to the 'ni^ln^t sphere of life; but in private fam- 
ilies, to shut up the only room perhaps in the house which is really 
wholesome for the family to live in, is inflicting a kind of lingering 



Vlll FAMILY MANAGEMENT. 

murder upon the inmates; and yet how frequently this considera- 
tion escapes persons who mean well by their family, but who still 
have a grate, a carpet, and chairs, too fine for every day's use. 

Another fruit of this evil is, seeing more company, and in a 
more expensive manner than is compatible with the general con- 
venience of the family, introducing with it an expense in dress, 
and a dissipation of time, from which it suffers in various ways. 

Social intercourse is not improved by parade, but quite the 
contrary; real friends, and the pleasantest kind of acquaintance, 
those who like to be sociable, are repulsed by it. It is a failure 
therefore every way the loss of what is really valuable, and an 
abortive attempt to be fashionable. 

A fundamental error in domestic life of very serious extent, 
involving no less the comfort than the health of the family, arises 
from the ignorance or mistaken notions of the mistress of the house 
upon the subjects of diet and cookery. 

The subject of cookery is thought by too many women to be 
below their attention, or, when practically engaged in, it is with 
no other consideration about it than, in the good housewife's 
phrase, to make the most of every thing, whether good, bad, or 
indifferent; or to contrive a thousand mischievous compositions, 
both savory and sweet, to recommend their own ingenuity. 

If cookery is worth studying, as a sensual gratification, it is 
surely much more so as a means of securing one of the greatest of 
human blessings good health; and we cannot quit this part of the 
subject of domestic management without observing, that one cause 
of a great deal of injurious cookery originates in the same vanity 
of show that is productive of so many other evils. In order to 
set out a table with a greater number of dishes than the situation 
of the family requires, more cookery is often undertaken than 
there are servants to do it well, or conveniences in the kitchen for 
the purpose. Thus some viands are done before they are wanted 
for serving up, and stand by spoiling, to make room for others; 
these are again perhaps to be succeeded by something else; and 
too often are things served up that had better be thrown away, 
than to be used for food. 

The leading consideration about food ought always to be its 
wholesomeness. Cookery may produce savory and pretty looking 
dishes without their possessing any of the qualities of food. It is 
at the same time both a serious and ludicrous reflection that it 
should be thought to do honor to our friends and ourselves to set 
out a table where indigestion and all its train of evils, such as 
fever, rheumatism, gout, and the whole catalogue of human dis- 
eases lie lurking in almost every dish. Yet this is both done, and 
taken as a compliment. We have indeed the " unbought grace 
of polished society, where gluttony loses half its vice by being 
stripped of its grossness." When a man at a public house dies of 
a surfeit of beef steak and porter, who does not exclaim, what a 
beast! 



COOKING UTENSILS. IX 

How infinitely preferable is a dinner of far less show where 
nobody need be afraid of what they are eating! and such a one 
will be genteel and respectable. If a person can give his friend 
only a leg of mutton, there is nothing to be ashamed of in it, pro- 
vided it is a good one, and well dressed. 

A house fitted up with plain good furniture, the kitchen fur- 
nished with clean wholesome-looking cooking utensils, good fires, 
in grates that give no anxiety lest a good fire should spoil them, 
clean good table linen, the furniture of the table and sideboard 
good of the kind, without ostentation, and a well-dressed plain 
dinner, bespeak a sound judgment and correct taste in a private 
family, that place it on a footing of respectability with the first 
characters in the country. It is only the conforming to our sphere, 
not the vainly attempting to be above it, that can command true 
respect. 

COOKING UTENSILS. 

The various utensils used for the preparation and keeping of 
food are made either of metal, glass, pottery ware, or wood; each 
of which is better suited to some particular purposes than the 
others. Metallic utensils are quite unfit for many uses, and the 
knowledge of this is necessary to the preservation of health in 
general, and sometimes to the prevention of immediate dangerous 
consequences. 

The metals commonly used in the construction of these vessels 
are silver, copper, brass, tin, iron, and lead. Silver is prefera- 
ble to all the others, because it cannot be dissolved by any of the 
substances used as food. Brimstone unites with silver, and forms 
a thin brittle crust over it, that gives it the appearance of being 
tarnished, which may be accidentally taken with food; but this 
is not particularly unwholesome, nor is it liable to be taken often, 
nor in large quantities. The discoloring of silver spoons used 
with eggs arises from the brimstone contained in eggs. Nitre or 
saltpetre has also a slight effect upon silver, but nitre and silver 
seldom remain long enough together in domestic uses to require 
any particular caution. 

Copper and brass are both liable to be dissolved by vinegar, 
acid fruits, and pearl-ash. Such solutions are highly poisonous, 
and great caution should be used to prevent accidents of the kind. 
Vessels made of these metals are generally tinned, that is, lined 
with a thin coating of a mixed metal, containing both tin and lead. 
Neither acids, nor any thing containing pearl-ash, should ever be 
suffered to remain above an hour in vessels of this kind, as the 
tinning is dissolvable by acids, and the coating is seldom perfect 
over the surface of the copper or brass. 

The utensils made of what is called block tin are constructed 
of iron plates coated with tin. This is equally to be dissolved as 
the tinning of copper or brass vessels, but iron is not an unwhole- 



X DIET. 

some substance, if even a portion of it should be dissolved and 
mixed in the food. Iron is therefore one of the safest metals for 
the construction of culinary utensils; and the objection to its more 
extensive use only rests upon its liability to rust, so that it requires 
more cleaning and soon decays. Some articles of food, such as 
quinces, orange peel, artichokes, &.c. are blackened by remaining 
in iron vessels, which therefore must not be used for them. 

Leaden vessels are very unwholesome, and should never be 
used for milk and cream, if it be ever likely to stand till it become 
sour. They are unsafe also for the purpose of keeping salted 
meats. 

The best kind of pottery ware is oriental china, because the 
glazing is a perfect glass, which cannot be dissolved, and the 
whole substance is so compact that liquid cannot penetrate it. 
Many of the English pottery wares are badly glazed, and as the 
glazing is made principally of lead, it is necessary to avoid put- 
ting vinegar, and other acids into them. Acids and greasy sub- 
stances penetrate into unglazed wares, excepting the strong stone 
ware; or into those of which the glazing is cracked, and hence 
give a bad flavor to any thing they are used for afterwards. They 
are quite unfit therefore for keeping pickles or salted meats. 
Glass vessels are infinitely preferable to any pottery ware but 
oriental china, and should be used whenever the occasion admits 
of it. 

Wooden vessels are very proper for the keeping many articles 
of food, and should always be preferred to those lined with lead. 
If any substance has fermented or become putrid in a wooden 
cask or tub, it is sure to taint the vessel so as to make it liable to 
produce a similar effect upon any thing that may be put into it in 
future. It is useful to char the insides of these wooden vessels 
before they are used, by burning wood shavings in them, so as to 
coat the insides with a crust of charcoal. 

As whatever contaminates food in any way must be sure, from 
the repetition of its baneful effects, to injure the health, a due 
precaution with respect to all culinary vessels is necessary for its 
more certain preservation. There is a kind of hollow iron ware 
lined with enamel, which is superior to every other utensil for 
sauces or preserves: indeed it is preferable for every purpose. 



DIET. 

That we require food, as vegetables require water, to support 
our existence, is the primary consideration upon which we should 
take it. But in our general practice of eating, it cannot be said, 
"we eat to live," but are living passages or channels, through 
which we are constantly propelling both solids and fluids, for the 
sake of pleasing our palates, at the severe cost often of our whole 
system. 



DIET. XI 

A reasonable indulgence in the abundant supplies of nature, 
converted by art to the purposes of wholesome food, is one of the 
comforts added to the maintenance of life. It is an indiscriminate 
gratification of our tastes, regardless of the consequences that 
may ensue from it, that is alone blamable. But so great is our 
general apathy in these respects, .that even on the occurrence of 
diseases, from which we are all more or less sufferers, we scarce- 
ly ever reflect on our diet, as the principal, if not the sole cause 
of them. We assign them to weather, to infection, to hereditary 
descent, to spontaneous breeding, as if a disease could originate 
without a cause; or to any frivolous imaginary source, without 
suspecting, or being willing to own, mismanagement of ourselves. 

We derive the renewal of our blood and juices, which are con- 
stantly exhausting, from the substances we take as food. As our 
food, therefore, is proper or improper, too much or too little, so 
will our blood and juices be good or bad, overcharged or deficient, 
and our state of health accordingly good or diseased. 

By aliment, or food, is to be understood whatever we eat or 
drink, including seasonings; such as salt, sugar, spices, vinegar, 
&c. Stc. Every thing, in short, which we receive into our sto- 
machs. Our food, therefore, consists not only of such particles 
as are proper for the nourishment and support of the human body, 
but likewise contains certain active principles, viz. salts, oils, and 
spirits, which have the properties of stimulating the solids, quick- 
ening the circulation, and making the fluids thinner; thus render- 
ing them more suited to undergo the necessary secretions of the 
body. 

The art of preserving health, and obtaining long life, therefore 
consists in the use of a moderate quantity of such diet as shall 
neither increase the salts and oils, so as to produce disease, nor 
diminish them, so as to suffer the solids to become relaxed. 

It is very difficult, almost impossible, to ascertain exactly what 
are the predominant qualities either in our bodies or in the food 
we eat. In practice, therefore, we can have no other rule but 
observing by experience what it is that hurts or does us good; 
and what it is our stomach can digest with facility, or the contrary. 
But then we must keep our judgment unbiassed, and not suffer it 
to become a pander to the appetite, and thus betray the stomach 
and health, to indulge our sensuality. 

The eating too little is hurtful, as well as eating too much. 
Neither excess, nor hunger, nor any thing else that passes the 
bounds of nature, can be good to man. 

By loading tli<> stomach, fermentation is checked, and of course 
dii_" <ti-tn iinjpadcd; for the natural juice of the stomach has not 
mom to exert it-i !!', and it therefore nauseates its contents, is 
! v ' i:ition<, the spirits are oppressed, obstructions 
ensue, and flier is the consequence. Besides, that when thus 
overfilled, tlV stomach pre<se< on the diaphragm, prevents tho 
proper plajf^the lungs, and occasions uneasiness in our breath- 



Xll DIET. 

ing. Hence arise various ill symptoms and depraved effects 
throughout the body, enervating the strength, decaying the senses, 
hastening old age, and shortening life. Though these effects are 
not immediately perceived, yet they are certain attendants of 
intemperance; for it has been generally observed in great eaters, 
that, though from custom, a state of youth, and a strong constitu- 
tion, they have no present inconvenience, but have digested their 
food, suffered surfeit, and borne their immoderate diet well ; if they 
have not been unexpectedly cut off, they have found the symptoms 
of old age come on early in life, attended with pains and innume- 
rable disorders. 

If we value our health, we must ever make it a rule not to eat 
to satiety or fulness, but desist while the stomach feels quite easy. 
Thus we shall be refreshed, light, and cheerful; not dull, heavy, 
or indisposed. Should we ever be tempted to eat too much at one 
time, we should eat the less at another. Thus, if our dinner has 
been larger than usual, let our supper be less, or rather quite 
omitted; for there is no man, however careful of his health, who 
does not occasionally transgress in this way. 

With regard to the times of eating, they must to a certain degree 
be conformed to family convenience, but ought to be quite inde- 
pendent of the caprices of fashion. The great things to be guard- 
ed against are, either eating too soon after a former meal, or 
fasting too long. The stomach should always have time to empty 
itself before it is filled again. 

Some stomachs digest their contents sooner than others, and if 
long empty it may destroy the appetite, and greatly disturb both 
the head and animal spirits; for, from the great profusion of nerves 
spread upon the stomach, there is an immediate sympathy between 
that and the head. Hence the head is sure to be affected by 
whatever disorders the stomach, whether from any particular ali- 
ment that disagrees with it, or being overfilled, or too long empty. 
Such as feel a gnawing in the stomach, as it is called, should not 
wait till the stated time of the next meal, but take a small quanti- 
ty of light, easily digested food, that the stomach may have some- 
thing to work on. 

Young persons in health, who use much exercise, may eat three 
times a day. But such as are in years, such as are weak, as do 
no work, use no exercise, or lead a sedentary life, eating twice in 
the day is sufficient ; or, as in the present habits of society, it might 
be difficult to arrange the taking only two meals, let them take 
three very moderate ones. Old and weak persons may eat often, 
but then it should be very little at a time. 

The quality of our food is a subject of greater difficulty than 
the quantity; moderation is an invariably safe guide in the latter 
instance; but though always favorable to prevent ill effects from 
any error in quality, it will not always be effectual. 

To a person in good health, with a strong stomach, and whose 
constant beverage is water, cold or tepid, according to the sea- 



DIET. Xlll 

son, or some aqueous liquor, the niceties of choice in food or 
cookery are less material than to persons with naturally weak sto- 
machs, or to those in sickness, or for children. But all persons 
who would to a certainty preserve their health and faculties, and 
live out the natural term of life, should use plain food, as all high 
seasonings and compound mixtures have an injurious effect, soon- 
er or later, on the strongest constitutions. If a few instances can 
be quoted to the contrary, these, like other anomalies in nature, 
cannot constitute an exception to a well established fact. 

.No part of our aliment is more important than our beverage. 
It is essential to moisten and convey our more solid food into the 
stomach, and from thence to the respective parts of the body. To 
allay thirst, to dilute the blood, that it may circulate through the 
minutest vessels, to dissolve and carry off by the watery secre- 
tions the superfluous salts we take in our food; to answer these 
purposes no liquid is so effectual as pure water, with the exception 
of some few cases. No other liquid circulates so well, or mixes so 
immediately with our fluids. All other liquors are impregnated 
\\itli particles which act strongly upon the solids or fluids, or both; 
but water being simple, operates only by diluting, moistening, and 
cooling, which are the great uses of drink pointed out to us by 
nature. Hence it is evident that water is in general the best and 
most wholesome drink; but some constitutions require something 
to warm and stimulate the stomach, and then fermented liquors 
taken in moderation are proper; such as beer, ale, cider, wine, 
&.c. the choice and quantity of which depend on the age, consti- 
tution, and manner of living of the drinker; and to have them 
pun- is above. .all things essential; as otherwise, instead of being 
of any benefit, they will be highly detrimental. 

Drams, or (iisrilled spirituous liquors, the use of which is unhap- 
pily very prevalent, are of the most poisonous qualities; and from 
their direful effects are the destruction of thousands. From the 
decree of heat they have undergone in distillation they acquire a 
corrosive and burning qualij, which makes them as certain to 
kill as laudanum |r arsenicjf hough not so soon. They contract 
the fibres and oCThe body, especially where they are 

the tenderest, as in fhe brain, and thus destroy the intellectual 
faculties. They injure the coat of the stomach, and thus expose 
tin- nerves and weaken the fibres till the whole stomach becomes 
at last soft, flabby, and relaxed. From whence ensues loss of 
appetite, indigestion, and diseases that generally terminate in 
premature death. Spirituous liquors in any way, whether alone, 
mixed with water, in punch, shrub, noyau, or other liqueurs, are 
all slow poisons. 

It would be endless to enter on an account of the different quali- 
ties of all sorts of wines, but it may be said in general, that all 
the light wines of a moderate strength, due age and maturity, are 
more wholesome for the constitution than the rich, hot strong 

B 



XIV BOILING. 

heavy wines; for the light wines inflame the juices of the body 
less and go off the stomach with less difficulty. 

The last thing to be said concerning liquors is, that wine and 
all other strong liquors, are as hard to digest as solid strong food. 
This is not only evident with respect to persons of weak stomachs 
and digestion, but also from strong healthy people, who only 
drink either water or small beer at their meals, and are able to 
eat and digest almost double the quantity of what they could if 
they drank strong liquors. It appears very plain, therefore, that 
we should not drink strong liquors at our meals, as by their heat 
and activity they hurry the food undigested into the habit of the 
body, and by that means lay a foundation for various distempers. 
An abstinence, in short, from fermented liquors would preserve 
our mental faculties in vigor, and our bodies from many painful 
disorders that afflict mankind, as there is no doubt that we may 
principally ascribe to them the gout, rheumatism, stone, cancer, 
fevers, hysterics, lunacy, apoplexy, and palsy. 



BOILING. 

This most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in 
perfection. It does not require quite so much nicety and atten- 
dance as roasting ; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiling 
(the slower the better) all the while, to know how long is required 
for doing the joint, &c., and to take it up at the critical moment 
when it is done enough, comprehends almost the whole art and 
mystery. This, however, demands a patient and perpetual vigi- 
lance, of which few persons are capable. 

The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all 
the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time ; and 
make up a sufficient fire at first, to last all the time, without much 
mending or stirring. A frugal cook will manage with much less 
fire for boiling than she uses for roasting. 

^When the pot is coming to a boil there will always, from the 
cleanest meat and clearest water, rise a' scum to the top of it, pro- 
ceeding partly from the water ; this must be carefully taken off as 
soon as it rises. 

On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When 
you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw 
up the rest of the scum. 

The oilener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water 
is kept, the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat. 
- If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat, which, 
instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse 
and filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the 
butcher and poulterer be blamed for the carelessness of the cook 
in not skimming her pot. 



BOILING. XV 

Many put in milk, to make what they boil look white ; but this 
does more harm than good : others wrap it up in a cloth ; but 
these are needless precautions : if the scum be attentively removed, 
meat will have a much more delicate color and finer flavor than it 
has when muffled up. This may give rather more trouble, but 
those who wish to excel in their art must only consider how the 
processes of it can be most perfectly performed : a cook, who has 
a proper pride and pleasure in her business, will make this her 
maxim on all occasions. 

It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickness, or, 
before thicker parts are done enough, the thinner will be done too 
much. 

Put your meat into cold water, in the proportion of about a quart 
of water to a pound of meat : it should be covered with water during 
the whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it ; the less 
water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savory will 
be the meat, and the better will be the broth. 

The water should be heated gradually, according to the thick- 
ness, &c. of the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of 
ten pounds weight should be placed over a moderate fire, which 
will gradually make the water hot, without causing it to boil for 
about forty minutes ; if the water boils much sooner, the meat will 
be hardened, and shrink up as if it was scorched : by keeping the 
water a certain time heating without boiling, the fibres of the meat 
are dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken 
off as soon as it rises. 

The editor placed a thermometer in water in that state which 
cooks call gentle simmering ; the heat was 212, i. e. the same 
degree as the strongest boiling. 

Two mutton chops were covered with cold water; one boiled a 
gallop, while the other simmered very gently for three-quarters of 
an hour* the chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly su- 
perior to that which was boiled ; it was much tenderer, more juicy, 
and much higher flavored. The liquor which boiled fast was in 
like proportion more savory, and when cold had much more fat 
on its surface. This explains why quick boiling renders meat - 
hard, &.c., because its juices are extracted in a greater degree. 

Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil. 

The old rule of 15 minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather 
too little : the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter 
it will be. 

For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all 
will who have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a 
pound for fresh, and rather more for salted meat, will not be found 
too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing 
more or less time, according to the thickness of the joint, and the 
coldness of the weather : to know the state of which, let a ther- 
mometer be placed in the pantry ; and when it falls below 40 , tell 



XVI BAKING. 

your cook to give rather more time in both roasting and boiling, 
always remembering, the slower it boils the better. 

Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art ; and cooks 
seem to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, 
and set it over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance 
whether it simmers without a bubble or boils a gallop. 

Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that 
which has been kept till it is what the butchers call ripe; and long- 
er in cold than in warm weather : if it be frozen, it must be thawed 
before boiling as before roasting ; if it be fresh-killed, it will be 
tough and hard, if you stew it ever so long, and ever so gently. 
In cold weather, the night before the day you dress it, bring it into 
a place of which the temperature is not less than 45 degrees of 
Fahrenheit's thermometer. 

The size of the boiling-pots should be adapted to what they are 
to contain : the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon 
the fire, and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate 
increase of fire to boil it. 

In small families we recommend block-tin saucepans, Sec. as 
lightest and safest. If proper care is taken of them, and they are 
well dried after they are cleaned, they are by far the cheapest ; 
the purchase of a new tin saucepan being little more than the ex- 
pense of tinning a copper one. 

Let the covers of your boiling-pots fit close, not only to prevent 
unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape 
of the nutritive matter, which must then remain either in the meat 
or in the broth ; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself 
under the edge of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste. 

If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done 
enough, it will become sodden, and lose its flavor. 

Beef and mutton a little wider-done (especially very larg,e joints, 
which will make the better hash or broil,) is not a great fault ; by 
some people it is preferred ; but lamb, pork, and veal are uneata- 
ble if not thoroughly boiled ; but do not over-do them. 

A trivet or fish-drainer put on the bottom of the boiling-pot, rais- 
ing the contents -about an inch and a half from the bottom, will 
prevent that side of the meat which comes next the bottom from 
being done too much, and the lower part of the meat will be as 
delicately done as the other part ; and this will enable you to take 
out the contents of the pot, without sticking a fork, &.c. into it. 
If you have not a trivet, use four skewers, or a soup-plate laid the 
wrong side upwards. 

BAKING. 

Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of 
dressing a dinner in small families; and, I may say, that the oven 
is often the only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a 
joint of meat. 



BAKING. XV11 

I do not mean to deny the superior excellence of roasting to 
baking; but some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the 
same when roasted, that I have known them to be carried to the 
table, and eaten as such with great satisfaction. 

Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many 
other joints, will bake to great advantage, if the meat be good; 
I mean well-fed, rather inclined to be fat: if the meat be poor, no 
baker can give satisfaction. 

When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been half 
baked I have seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarcely 
to be believed. 

Besides those joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate a few 
baked dishes which I can particularly recommend. 

A pig, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have 
its ears and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, 
and a bit of butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back 
with, otherwise it will be apt to blister: with a proper share of 
attention from the baker, I consider this way equal to a roasted 
one. 

A goose prepa'red the same as for roasting, taking care to have 
it on a stand, and when half done to turn the other side upwards. 
A duck the same. 

A buttock of beef the following way is particularly fine. After 
it has been in salt about a week, to be well washed, and put into 
a brown earthen pan with a pint of water; cover the pan tight 
with two or three thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper: never 
cover anything that is to be baked with brown paper, the pitch 
and tar that is in brown paper will give the meat a smoky, bad 
taste: give it four or five hours in a moderately heated oven. 

A ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out and 
wiped, a crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and baked in 
a moderately heated oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer 
flavor, than a boiled one. I have been in the habit of baking 
small cod-fish, haddock, and mackerel, with a dust of flour, and 
some bits of butter put on them; eels, when large and stuffed; 
herrings and sprats, in a brown pan, with vinegar and a little 
spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared, the same as 
for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, and a little drop of milk 
put into the dish, and basted several times, will be found nearly 
equal to roasting ; or cut it up, season it properly, put it into a 
jar or pan, and cover it over and bake it in a moderate oven for 
about three hours. In the same manner, I have been in the hab- 
it of baking legs and shins of beef, ox cheeks, &c. prepared with 
a seasoning of onions, turnips, &.c.:jthey will take about four 
hours: let them stand till cold, to skim off the fat; then wa'rm it 
up all together^ or part, as you may want it. 

All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first families. 

The time each of the above articles should take depends much 
upon the state of the oven, and I do consider the baker a suf-

ROASTING. 



ficient judge; if they are sent to him in time, he must be very 
neglectful if they are not ready at the time they are ordered. 



ROASTING. 

Let the young cook never forget that cleanliness is the chief 
cardinal virtue of the kitchen; the first preparation for roasting 
is to take care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand and 
water; nothing else. When it has been well scoured with this, 
dry it with a clean cloth. If spits are wiped clean as soon as the 
meat is drawn from them, and while they are hot, a very little 
cleaning will be required. The less the spit is passed through 
the meat the better; and, before you spit it, joint it properly, es- 

Recially necks and loins, that the carver may separate them easi- 
/ and neatly, and take especial care it be evenly balanced on 
the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the fire operate 
equally on each part of it; therefore, be provided with balancing- 
skewers and cookholds, and see it is properly jointed. 

Make up the fire in time; let it be proportioned to the dinner 
to be dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end 
than the thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be 
done nice and brown. 

A cook must be as particular to proportion her fire to the busi- 
ness she has to do, as a chemist: the degree of heat most desira- 
ble for dressing the different sorts of food ought to be attended 
to with the utmost precision. 

The fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble sirloin 
will parch up a lighter joint. 

Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly 
avoid it; but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a 
considerable distance, and allow a little more lime. 

Preserve the fat, by covering it with paper, for this purpose 
called. " kitchen-paper," and tie it on with fine twine; pins and 
skewers can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to 
let out the gravy: besides, the paper often starts from them and 
catches fire, to the great injury of the meat. 

If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should 
be little and brisk: when you have a large joint to roast, make up 
a sound, strong fire, equally good in every part, or your meat 
cannot be equally roasted, nor have that uniform color which 
constitutes the beauty of good roasting. 

Give the fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down; 
examine it from time to time while the spit is going round ; keep 
it clear at the bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in 
the front, which will spoil the look and taste of the meat, and 
hinder it from roasting evenly. 

When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end than the 
other, place th^ qpit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the fire. 



ROASTING. XIX 

Do not put meat too near the fire at first; the larger the joint, * 
the farther it must be kept from the h're: if once it gets scorched, 
the outside will become hard, and acquire a disagreeable, empyr- 
eumatic taste ; and the fire being prevented from penetrating into 
it, the meat will appear done before it is little more than half 
done, besides losing the pale brown color, which it is the beauty 
of roasted meat to have. 

Be very careful to place the dripping-pan at such a distance 
from the fire as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near, the 
ashes will fall into it, and spoil the drippings. 

If it is too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose 
your drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by 
the fetid smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live 
cinders. , 

A large dripping-pan is convenient for several purposes. It 
should not be less than twenty-eight inches long and twenty inch- 
es wide, and have a covered well on the side from the fire, to 
collect the drippings; this will preserve them in the most delicate 
state : in a pan of the above size you may set fried fish, and vari- 
ous dishes, to keep hot. 

The time meat will take roasting will vary according to the 
time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather; the 
same weight will be twenty minutes or half an hour longer in 
cold weather, than it will be in warm; and if fresh killed, than if 
it 1ms been kept till it is tender. 

Everybody knows the advantage of slow boiling. Slow roasting 
is equally important. 

It is difficult to give any specific rule for time; but if your fire 
is made as before directed, your meat-screen sufficiently large to 
guard what you are dressing from currents of air, and the meat 
is not frosted, you cannot do better than follow the old general 
rule of allowing rather more than a quarter of an hour to the 
pound; a little more or less, according to the temperature of the 
weather, in proportion as the piece is thick or thin, the strength 
of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and the frequency with 
which you baste it; the more it is basted the less time it will take, 
as it keeps the meat soft and mellow on the outside, and the fire 
acts with more force upon it. 

Reckon the time, not to the hour when dinner is ordered, but 
to the moment the roasts will be wanted. Supposing there are a 
dozen people to sip soup and eat fish first, you may allow them 
ten or fifteen minutes for the former, and about as long for the 
latter, more or less, according to the temptations the " BON GOUT" 
of these preceding courses has to attract their attention. 

When the joint is half done, remove the spit and dripping-pan- 
back, and stir tip your fire thoroughly, that it may burn clear and 
bright lor the browning; when the steam from the meat draws to- 
wards the fire, it is a sifrn of its bcinir dom- -M ii^h; but you will 
be the best judge of that, from the time it ha.s been down, the 



XX FRYING. 

strength of the fire you have used, and the distance your spit has 
been from it. 

Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy, and 
just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire to brown it. If 
you wish to froth it, baste it, and dredge it with flour carefully: 
you cannot do this delicately nice without a very good light. 
The common fault seems to be using too much flour. The meat 
should have a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of 
being covered with a paste. Those who are particular about the 
froth use butter instead of drippings. 

A good cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance and 
color of her roasts, as a young beauty is to her complexion at a 
birthday ball. If your meat does not brown so much, or so even- 
ly as you wish, take two ounces of glaze, i. e. portable soup, put 
four table-spoonfuls of water, and let it warm and dissolve gradu- 
ally by the side of the fire. This will be done in about a quarter 
of an hour; put it on the meat equally all over with a paste-brush 
the last thing before it goes to table. 

Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally 
considered one of the most easy and simple processes of cook- 
ery, it requires more unremitting attention to perform it perfect- 
ly well than it does to make most made dishes. 

That made dishes are the most difficult preparations, deserves 
to be reckoned among the culinary vulgar errors; in plain roast- 
ing and boiling it is not easy to repair a mistake once made; and 
all the discretion and attention of a steady, careful cook, must 
be unremittingly upon the alert. 



FRYING. 

Frying is often a convenient mode of cookery; it may be per- 
formed by a fire which will not do for roasting or boiling; and by 
the introduction of the pan between the meat and the fire, things 
get more equally dressed. 

The Dutch oven or bonnet is a very convenient utensil for small 
things, and a very useful substitute for the jack, the gridiron, or 
frying-pan. 

A frying-pan should be about four inches deep, with a perfectly 
flat and thick bottom, twelve inches long and nine broad, with 
perpendicular sides, and must be half filled with fat: good frying 
is, in fact, boiling in fat. To make sure that the pan is quite 
clean, rub a little fat over it, and then make it warm, and wipe it 
out with a clean cloth. 

Be very particular in fryiug, never to use any oil, butter, lard, 
or drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and tree from salt. 
Any thing dirty spoils the look; any thing bad-tasted or stale, 
spoils the flavor; and salt prevents its browning. 

Fine olive oil is the most delicate for frying; but the best oil is 
expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it. 
. 



PRYING. XXI 

For general purposes, and especially for fish, clean fresh lard 
is not near so expensive as oil or clarified butter, and does almost 
as well. Butter often burns before you are aware of it; and what 
you fry will get a dark and dirty appearance. 

Dripping, if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as any 
thing; if not clean, it may be easily clarified. Whatever fat you 
use, after you have done frying, let it remain in the pan for a few 
minutes, and then pour it through a sieve into a clean basin; it 
will do three or four times as well as it did at first, t. e. if it has not 
burned: but, the fat you have fried fish in must not be used for 
any other purpose. 

To know when the fat is of a proper heat, according to what 
you are to fry, is the great secret in frying. 

To fry fish, parsley, potatoes, or any thing that is watery, your 
fire must be very clear, and the fat quite hot; which you may be 
pretty sure of, when it has done hissing, and is still. We cannot 
insist too strongly on this point: if the fat is not very hot, you 
cannot fry fish either to a good color, or firm and crisp. 

To be quite certain, throw a little bit of bread into the pan; if it 
fries crisp, the fat is ready; if it burns the bread, it is too hot. 

The fire under the pan must be clear and sharp, otherwise the 
$ fat is so long before it becomes ready, and demands such attend- 
ance to prevent the accident of its catching fire, that the patience 
of cooks is exhausted, and they frequently, from ignorance or im- 
patience, throw in what they are going to fry before the fat is half 
hot enough. Whatever is so fried will be pale and sodden, and 
offend the palate and stomachflfet less than the eye. 

Have a good light to fry by, that you may see when you have 
got the right color: a lamp fixed on a stem, with a loaded foot, 
which has an arm that lengthens out, and slides up and down like 
a reading candlestick, is a most useful appendage to kitchen fire- 
places, which are very seldom light enough for the nicer opera- 
tions of cookery. 

After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the fat from what you 
have fried, especially from those things that are full dressed in 
bread crumbs, or biscuit powder, Stc., your cooking will do you 
no credit. 

The dryness of fish depends much upon its having been fried in 
fat of a due degree of heat; it is then crisp and dry^in a few min- 
utes alter it is taken out of the pan: when it is not, lay it on a soft 
cloth before the fire, turning it occasionally, till it is. This will 
sometimes take fifteen minutes: therefore, always fry fish as long 
as this before you want them, for fear you may find this necessary. 

To fry fish, see receipt to fry soles, which is the only circum- 
stantial account of the process that has yet been printed. If the 
cook will study it with a little attention, she must soon become an 
accomplished frier. 

Frying, though one of the most common of culinary operations, 
is one that is least commonly performed perfectly well. 



XX11 BROILING. 



BROILING. 

Cleanliness is extremely essential in this mode of cookery. 

Keep your gridiron quite clean between the bars, and bright on 
the top: when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen cloth: just before 
you use it, rub the bars with clean mutton-suet, to prevent the 
meat from being marked by the gridiron. 

Take care to prepare your fire in time, so that it may burn 
quite clear: a brisk and clear fire is indispensable, or you cannot 
give your meat that browning which constitutes the perfection of 
this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to food it cannot receive 
any other way. 

The chops or slices should be from half to three-quarters of an 
inch in thickness; if thicker, they will be done too much on the 
outside before the inside is done enough. 

Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing is 
done: never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you make 
smoke and spoil it. 

Let the bars of the gridiron be all hot through, but yet not 
burning hot upon the surface: this is the perfect and fine condition 
of the gridiron. 

As the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers, it 
is absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly hot before the 
thing to be cooked be laid on them. 

The bars of gridirons should be made concave, and terminate in 
a trough to catch the gravy and keep the fat from dropping into 
the fire and making a smoke, which will spoil the broil. 

Upright gridirons are the best, as they can be used at any fire 
without fear of smoke; and the gravy is preserved in the trough 
under them. 

N. B. Broils must be brought to table as hot as possible ; set a 
dish to heat when you put your chops on the gridiron, from whence 
to the mouth their progress must be as quick as possible. 

When the fire is not clear, the business of the gridiron may be 
done by the Dutch oven or bonnet. 

Take care to have a very clear, brisk fire; throw a little salt on 
it; make the gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to prevent the fat 
from dropping into the fire, and making a smoke. It requires 
more practice and care than is generally supposed to do steaks to 
a nicety; and for want of these little attentions, this very common 
dish, which every body is supposed capable of dressing, seldom 
comes to table in perfection. 

Ask those you cook for, if they like it under, or thoroughly 
done; and what accompaniments they like best; it is usual to put 
a table-spoonful of ketchup, or a little minced eschalot, into a dish 
before the fire; while you are broiling, turn the steak, &c. with a 
pair of steak-tongs, it will be done in about tenor fifteen minutes; 
rub a bit of butter over it, and send it up garnished with pickles 
and finely-scraped horse-radish. 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. XX111 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

, The cook must pay continual attention to the condition of her 
stew-pans, soup-kettles, &.c. which should be examined every time 
they are used. The prudent housewife will carefully examine the 
condition of them herself at least once a month. Their covers 
also must be kept perfectly clean and well tinned, and the stew- 
pans not only on the inside, but abotit a couple of inches on the 
outside: many mischiefs arise from their getting out of repair; 
and if not kept nicely tinned, all your good work will be in vain; 
the broths and soups will look green and dirty, taste bitter and 
poisonous, and will be spoiled both for the eye and palate, and 
your credit will be lost. 

The health, and even life of the family, depends upon this, and 
the cook may be sure her employers had rather pay the tinman's 
bill than the doctor's; therefore, attention to this cannot fail to 
engage the regard of the mistress, between whom and the cook it 
will be my utmost endeavor to promote perfect harmony. 

If she has the misfortune to scorch or blister the tinning of her 
pan, which will happen sometimes to the most careful cook, I ad- 
vise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint her employers, 
who will thank her for candidly mentioning an accident; and cen- 
sure her deservedly if she conceal it. 

Take care to be properly provided with sieves and tammy cloths, 
spoons and ladles. Make it a rule without an exception, never to 
use them till they are well cleaned and thoroughly dried, nor any 
stew-pans, &c. without first washing them out with boiling water, 
and rubbing them well with a dry cloth and a little bran, to clean 
them from grease, sand, &LC., or any bad smell they may have got 
since they were last used: never neglect this. 

Though we do not suppose our cook to be such a naughty slut 
as to wilfully neglect her broth-pots, &c., yet we may recommend 
her to wash them immediately, and take care they are thoroughly 
dried at the fire, before they are put by, and to keep them in a dry 
place, for damp will rust and destroy them very soon: attend to 
this the first moment you can spare after the dinner is sent up. 

Never put by any soup, gravy, &c. in metal utensils; in which 
never keep any thing longer than is absolutely necessary for the 
purposes of cookery; the acid, vegetables, fat, &c. employed in 
making soups, &c. are capable of dissolving such utensils: there- 
fore stone or earthern vessels should be used for this purpose. 

Stew-pans, soup-pots, and preserving pans, with thick and round 
bottoms (such as saucepans are made with), will wear twice as 
long, and are cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sides 
are soldered to the bottom, for sand and grease get into the 
joined part, and cookeys say that it is next to an impossibility to 
dislodge it, even if their nails are as long as Nebuchadnezzar's. 

Take care that the lids fit as close as possible, that the broth, 



XXIV BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

soup, and sauces, Stc. may not waste by evaporation. They are 
good for nothing, unless they fit tight enough to keep the steam in 
and the smoke out. 

Stew-pans and saucepans should be always bright on the upper 
rim, where the fire does not burn them; but to scour them all over 
is not only giving the cook needless trouble, but wearing out the 
vessels. 

Lean, juicy beef, mutton, or veal, form the basis of broth; pro- 
cure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and as fresh 
killed as possible. 

Stale meat will make broth grouty and bad tasted, and fat meat 
is wasted. This only applies to those broths which are required 
to be perfectly clear: fat and clarified drippings may be so com- 
bined with vegetable mucilage, as to afford, at the small cost of 
one penny per quart, a nourishing and palatable soup, fully ade- 
quate to satisfy appetite and support strength: this will open a 
new source to those benevolent housekeepers, who are disposed 
to relieve the poor, will show the industrious classes how much 
they have it in their power to assist themselves, and rescue them 
from being objects of charity dependent on the precarious bounty 
of others, by teaching them how they may obtain a cheap, abun- 
dant, salubrious, and agreeable aliment for themselves and fam- 
ilies. 

This soup has the advantage of being very easily and very soon 
made, with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room. Those 
who have not tasted it, cannot imagine what a salubrious, savory, 
and satisfying meal is produced by the judicious combination of 
cheap homely ingredients. 

The general fault of our soups seems to be the employment of 
an excess of spice, and too small a portion of roots and herbs. . 

There is no French dinner without soup, which is regarded as 
an indispensable overture; and believe it an excellent plan to begin 
the banquet with a basin of good soup, which, by moderating the 
appetite for solid animal food, is certainly a salutiferous custom. 

We again caution the cook to avoid over-seasoning, especially 
with predominant flavors, which, however agreeable they may be 
to some, are extremely disagreeable to others. 

Zest, soy, cavice, coratch, anchovy, curry powder, savory ra- 
gout powder, soup herb powder, browning, ketchups, pickle li- 
quor, beer, wine, and sweet herbs, and savory spice, are very 
convenient auxiliaries to finish soups, &.c. 

The proportion of wine should not exceed a large wine-glass- 
ful to a quart of soup. This is as much as can be admitted, 
without the vinous flavor becoming remarkably predominant; 
though not only much larger quantities of wine (of which claret is 
incomparably the best, because it contains less spirit and more 
flavor, and English palates are less acquainted with it), but even 
veritable cau de vie is ordered in many books, and used by many 
(especially tavern cooks). So much are their soups overloaded

with relish, that if you will eat enough of them they will certainly 
make you drunk, if they don't make you sick: all this frequently 
arises from an old cook measuring the excitability of the eaters' 
palates by his own, which may be so blunted by incessant tasting, 
that to awaken it, requires win? instead of water, and cayenne 
and garlic for black pepper and onion. 

The art of composing a rich soup is so to proportion the seve- 
ral ingredients one to another, that no particular taste be strong- 
er than the rest, but to produce such a fine harmonious relish that 
the whole is delightful. This requires that judicious combination 
of the materials which constitutes the "cluf d'ceuvre" of culinary 
science. 

In the first place, take care that the roots and herbs be per- 
fectly well cleaned ; proportion the water to the quantity of meat 
and other ingredients, generally a pound of meat to a quart of 
water for soups, and double that quantity for gravies. If they 
stew gently, little more water need be put in at first than is ex- 
pected at the end; for when the pot is covered quite close, and 
the fire gentle, very little is wasted. 

Gentle stewing is incomparably the best; the meat is more ten- 
der, and the soup better flavored. 

It is of the first importance that the cover of a soup-kettle 
should fit very close, or the broth will evaporate before you are 
aware of it. 

Place your soup-pot over a moderate fire, which will make the 
witter hot without causing it to boil for at least half an hour; if 
the water boils immediately, it will not penetrate the meat, and 
cleanse it from the clotted blood, and other matters which ought to 
go off' in scum; the meat will be hardened all over by violent heat; 
will shrink up as if it was scorched, and give hardly any gravy: 
on the contrary, by keeping the water a certain time heating with- 
out boiling, the meat swells, becomes tender, its fibres arfe dilated, 
and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon 
as it appears. 

It is not till after a good half hour's hot infusion that we may 
mend the fire, and make the pot boil : still continue to remove the 
scum; and when no more appears, put in the vegetables, &c. and 
a little salt. These will cause more scum to rise, which must be 
taken off immediately; then cover the pot very closely, and place 
it at a proper distance from the fire, where it will boil very gently, 
and equally, and by no means fast. 

By quick and strong boiling the volatile and finest parts of tho 
ingredients are evaporated, and fly off with the steam, and the 
coarser parts are rendered soluble ; so you lose the good, and get 
the bad. 

Soups will generally take from three to six hours. 

Prepare your broths and soups the evening before you want 
them. This will give you more time to attend to the rest of your 
dinner the next day; and when the soup is cold, the fat may be 

C 



XXVI BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

much more easily and completely removed from the surface of it. 
When you decant it, take care not to disturb the settlings at the 
bottom of the vessel, which are so tine that they will escape through 
a sieve, or even through a TAMIS, which is the best strainer, the 
soups appear smoother and finer, and it is much easier cleaned 
than any sieve. If you strain it while it is hot, pass it through a 
clean tamis or napkin, previously soaked in cold water ; the cold- 
ness of this will coagulate the fat, and only suffer the pure broth 
to pass through. 

The full flavor of the ingredients can only be extracted by very 
long and slow simmering ; during which take care to prevent 
evaporation, by covering the pot as close as possible: the best 
stew-pot is a digester. 

Clear soups must be perfectly transparent; thickened soups, 
about the consistence of rich cream; and remember that thickened 
soups require nearly double the quantity of seasoning. 

To thicken and give body to soups and sauces, the following 
materials are used: they must be gradually mixed with the soup 
till thoroughly incorporated with it; and it should have at least 
half an hour's gentle simmering after: if it is at all lumpy, pass it 
through a tamis or a fine sieve. Bread raspings, bread, isinglass, 
potato mucilage, flour, or fat skimmings and flour, or flour and 
butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal and water rubbed well together. 

To their very rich gravies, &c. the French add the white meat 
of partridges, pigeons, or fowls, pounded to a pulp, and rubbed 
through a sieve. A piece of beef, which has been boiled to make 
broth, pounded in the like manner with a bit of butter and flour, 
and gradually incorporated with the gravy or soup, will be found 
a satisfactory substitute for these more expensive articles. 

Meat from which broth has been made and all its juice has been 
extracted, is then excellently well prepared for POTTING, and is 
quite as good, or better, than that which has been baked till it is 
dry; indeed, if it be pounded, and seasoned in the usual manner, 
it will be an elegant and savory luncheon, or supper, and costs 
nothing but the trouble of preparing it, which is very little, and a 
relish is procured for sandwiches, &c. of what heretofore has been 
by the poorest housekeeper considered the perquisite of the CAT. 

Keep some spare broth lest your soup-liquor waste in boiling, 
and get too thick, and for gravy for your made dishes, various 
sauces, &c.; for many of which it is a much better basis than 
melted butter. 

T.he soup of mock turtle, and the other thickened soups, will 
supply you with a thick gravy sauce for poultry, fish, ragoutt, &c. ; 
and by a little management of this sort, you may generally con- 
trive to have plenty of good gravies and good sauces with very 
little trouble or expense. 

If soup is (too thin or too weak, take oFthe cover of your soup- 
pot, and let it boil till some of the watery part of it has evaporated, 
or else add some of the thickening materials we have before men- 



OBSERVATIONS. XXVU 

tioned ; and have at hand some plain browning. This simple pre- 
paration is much better than any of the compounds bearing that 
name; as it colors sauce or soup without much interfering with its 
flavor, and is a much better way of coloring them than burning 
the surface of the meat. 

When soups and gravies are kept from day to day, in hot weather, 
they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded 
tureens or pans, and placed in a cool cellar; in temperate weather 
every other day may be enough. 

We hope we have now put the common cook into possession of 
the whole arcana of soup-making, without much trouble to herself, 
or expense to her employers. It would greatly diminish the ex- 
pense, and improve soups, if th agents employed to give them a 
zest were not put in above fifteen minutes before the finish, and 
half the quantity of spice, &c. would do. A strong heat soon dis- 
sipates the spirit of the wine, and evaporates the aroma and flavor 
of the spices and herbs, which are volatile in the heat of boiling 
water. 

Warm fluids, in the form of soup, unite with our juices much 
sooner and better than those that are cold and raw : on this ac- 
count, RESTORATIVE SOUP is the best food for those who are en- 
feebled by disease or dissipation, and for old people, whose teeth 
and digestive organs are impaired. 

After catching cold, in nervous headaches, cholics, indigestions, 
and different kinds of cramp and spasms in the stomach, warm 
broth is of excellent service. 

After intemperate feasting, to give the stomach a holyday for a 
day or two by a diet on mutton broth, or vegetable soup, Stc. is the 
best way to restore its tone. " The stretching any power to its 
utmost extent weakens it. If the stomach be every day obliged to 
do as much as it can, it will every day be able to do less. A wise 
traveller will never force his horse to perform as much as he can 
in one day upon a long journey." 



OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN ARTICLES. 

We shall conclude these Introductory Observations, with a few 
remarks on the qualities of certain Articles in common use. 

Butler. 

Well made pure butter is lenient and nourishing, eaten cold, 
in moderation, with bread. But upon hot new bread, or hot 
toast, or used as sauce to animal food, it is not wholesome. In 
the two first instances it is very apt to turn acid in the stomach; 
and in the latter, to float uppermost in the stomach, and disturb 
the digestion. If melted thick and carefully, and eaten with 
vegetable food and bread only, it is not so liable to this objection. 

Butter is good for dry, constipated habits, but not for such as 
are bilious, asthmatic, or corpulent. 



OBSERVATIONS. 

Honey. 

Honey is nourishing and wholesome, particularly for persons 
with coughs, weak lungs, and short breath. It is balsamic, 
cleansing, and makes the body soluble. 

Great care should be taken to get it fresh and pure; it is apt 
to turn sour by long keeping. 

Sugar. 

Sugar used in moderation is nourishing and good, but much 
of it destroys the appetite, and injures the digestion. Moist 
sugar is the sweetest, and most opening; refined sugar, of a bind- 
ing nature. The preparations made of sugar, such as barley- 
sugar, sugar-candy, &c. are all indigestible and bad, as the good 
properties of the sugar are destroyed by the process it undergoes 
in the making them. They are particularly injurious to children, 
from cloying their delicate stomachs. Young children are in 
general better without sugar, as it is very apt to turn acid and 
disagree with weak stomachs; and the kind of food they take 
has natural sweetness enough in it not at all to require it. 

Salt. 

Salt, moderately used, especially with flesh, fish, butter, and 
cheese, is very beneficial, as it naturally stimulates weak or dis- 
ordered stomachs, and checks fermentations. But if it be im- 
moderately used it has a contrary effect. Very little salt should 
be used with vegetable food of the grain or seed kind; for the 
less salt that is put to it the milder, cooler, pleasanter, and easier 
or' digestion it will be. Salt excites the appetite, assists the 
stomach in digesting crude phlegmatic substances, is cleansing, 
and prevents putrefaction; but if too much used, it heats and dries 
the blood and natural moisture. It is best for phlegmatic, cold, 
and moist stomachs; and most injurious to hot, lean bodies. 

Salt-petre is particularly bad for bilious persons. 

Vinegar. 

Vinegar is cooling, opening, excites the appetite, assists diges- 
tion, is good for hot stomachs, resists putrefaction, and there- 
fore very good against pestilential diseases. Too much use of it 
injures the nerves, emaciates some constitutions, is hurtful to the 
breast, and makes people look old and withered, with pale lips. 

The best vinegar is that which is made of the best wines. 
Lemon-juice and verjuice have much the same qualities and ef- 
fects as vinegar. 

The commonest vinegar is least adulterated. 

Mustard. 

Mustard quickens the appetite, warms the stomach, assists in 
digesting hard meats, and dries up surperfluous moisture. It sel* 
dom agrees with weak stomachs.. 



OBSERVATIONS. XXIX 

Spices. 

Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and ginger, may be esteemed 
the best of spices. 

Nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, and allspice, are generally 
productive of indigestion and headache to weak persons. 

Garlic, (fc. 

Garlic, onions, rocambole, shallots, leeks, and horse-radish, 
are occasionally good for strong stomachs, but generally disa- 
gree with weak stomachs. 

Tea. 

The frequent drinking of a quantity of strong tea, as is the 
general practice, relaxes and weakens the tone of the stomach, 
whence proceeds nausea and indigestion, with a weakness of the 
nerves, and flabbiness of the flesh, and very often a pale wan 
complexion. Milk, when mixed with it in some quantity, lessens 
its bad qualities, by rendering it softer, and nutritious; and, with 
a moderate quantity of sugar, it may then be a proper breakfast, 
as a diluent, to those who are strong, and live freely, in order to 
cleanse the alimentary passages, and wash off the salts from the 
kidneys and bladder. But persons of weak nerves ought to ab- 
stain from it as carefully as from drams and cordial drops; as it 
causes the same kind of irritation on the tender delicate fibres of 
the stomach, which ends in low-ness, trembling and vapors. 

It should never be drank hot by any body. Green tea is less 
wholesome than black or bohea. 

Coffee. 

Coffee affords very little nourishment, and is apt to occasion 
heat, dryness, stimulation and tremors of the nerves, and for 
these reasons is thought to occasion palsies, watchfulness, and 
leanness. Hence it is very plain that it must be pernicious to hot, 
dry, and bilious constitutions. If moderately used it may be 
beneficial to phlegmatic persons, but, if drank very strong, or in 
grejit quantities, it will prove injurious even to them. 

The following remarks on Coffee, were published in London, 
by a physician. 1st. The raw coffee should be round and small 
grained, free from dirt and of a light color. It should have no 
appearance of mouldiness, and be kept quite free from any strong 
smell. It should not be long kept in sacks with other provisions, 
as there is no substance more apt to obtain strong and disagree- 
able odors from the presence of its neighbors. Rum injures it; 
and Miller even goes so far as to state that a few bags of pepper 
on board a ship from India upon one occasion spoiled the whole 
cargo. 

C2 



XXX OBSEHVATIONS. 

2nd. When the grains are large, flat, and of a green color, 
they should be kept on hand, in a dry situation, a long time before 
use. Every West India planter knows this fact, although his 
interest often induces him to send the article to market before it 
is old and dry enough. 

3d. Roasting coffee is by far the most difficult operation of the 
housekeeper; when carried far enough, an aromatic oil is formed 
by the heat and forces itself out upon the surface of the grains, 
giving them a glossy appearance, and an odor which is consider- 
ed their perfection; yet too little roasting prevents the aroma 
from appearing, and too much completely volatilizes it. leaving 
nothing but a flat bitter taste. The heat should be strong and 
the operation shortened as much as possible without burning the 
grains. The roaster should be close or well covered all the time, 
and in order to improve the looks and flavor, a small piece of 
butter may be added to the coffee, while parching. 

4th. When thus prepared, coffee may be preserved for use in 
large quantities, without losing niuch of its freshness, provided 
the vessels containing it be well covered. 

5th. An infusion of coffee is better than a decoction, simply 
because the heat, in the last case, b(-ing stronger and more last- 
ing, drives off more of the aromatic oil. It is better, therefore, 
to grind the coffee very fine, and then to expose it, by means of 
a bag or strainer, to the action of boiling water, than to boil it 
any length of time. Heat, though unavoidable, injures the flavor, 
and the best coffee I remember to have tasted was made by ex- 
posing the powder to a pressure of cold water; a^ea-spoonful of 
this extract, thrown into a cup of hot water, was sufficient. It is 
not a bad method to allow the ground coffee to lie in cold water 
between meals, and then prepare it by adding hot water. Just in 
proportion to the continuance of heat, in this and in the last 
operation, the fragrance disappears, and is replaced by a strong 
bitter taste, which, according to the experiments of Chenevix, de- 
pends upon the presence of tannin (resembling that in tan bark). 
Roasting, besides forming this bitter substance, deprives the cof- 
fee of its nutritious qualities. 

Chocolate. 

Is rich, nutritious, and soothing, saponaceous, and cleansing; 
from which quality it often helps digestion, and excites the appe- 
tite. It as only proper for some of the leaner and stronger sort of 
phlegmatic constitutions, and some old people who are healthy, 
and accustomed to bodily exercise. 

Cocoa. 

Is of the same nature as chocolate, but not so rich; and there- 
fore lighter upon the stomach. 



OBSERVATIONS. XXXI 

Fruit. 

Fruits are of different degrees of digestibility. Those of a hard 
texture, as some kinds of apples, melons, apricots, several sorts 
of fleshy plums, and all immature fruits, are difficult of digestion. 

Strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, cherries, 
green-gages, peaches, nectarines, melting pears, mulberries, figs, 
grapes, medlars, when all quite ripe, are more easily dissolved in 
the stomach. 

Fruit, moderately eaten, is wholesome, particularly as correct- 
ing the grossness of animal food. But an excess of it, and es- 
pecially of unripe fruit, is productive of many diseases; amongst 
children in particular, it often occasions such as the nettle rash 
and St. Anthony's fire. 

Fruit invariably disagrees with bilious persons; but is a sover- 
eign remedy for the sea scurvy, and for diseases arising from an 
excess of animal food. 

JVu/s and Mmonda. 

Most kinds of nuts, and almonds, from their milky or oily na- 
ture, contain a good deal of nourishment; but they require to be 
well chewed, as they are difficult of digestion. Persons with 
weak stomachs should not eat them. The worst time at which 
they can be eaten is after a meal. 

Olives. 

Olives that have been gathered immature or unripe, and put into 
a pickle to keep them sound, are apt, especially if frequently eaten, 
to obstruct the stomach and passages. The best way of eating 
them is with good bread, when the stomach is properly empty. To 
eat them upon a full stomach is very bad. 



NOTE. 

Receipts for making all kinds of Bread, Biscuits, Blancmange, 
Buns, Broth, Cakes, Creams, Custards, Jams, Jellies, Paste, Pies, 
Puddings, Soups, Sauces, &c., will be found under these general 
beads ; the method of cooking the several meats are arranged under 
the name of each meat. Still there are interspersed throughout the

supply at market, and the demand for it. 

It is generally dearest from March to July, and cheapest about Sep- 
tember, when the Game season commences, and the weather being colder, 
allows of its being brought from more distant parts. 



MARKETING. XXXV 

The above information will, we trust, lie very acceptable to Economi- 
cal Families, who, from hearing the very high price Poultry sometimes 
costs, are deterred from ever inquiring about it. In the cheap seasons 
we have noted, it is sometimes as cheap as Butcher-meat. 

Those who pay the highest, do not always pay the dearest, price. In 
fact, the Best Meat is the cheapest ; and those who treat a tradesman 
liberally, have a much better chance of being well served, than those who 
are forever bargaining for the Market Penny. In dividing the Joints, 
there is always an opportunity of apportioning the Bones, Fat, Flaps, 
Sfc. so as to make up a variation of much more than a penny per pound 
in most pieces ; and a Butcher will be happy to give the turn of his knife 
in favor of that Customer icho cheerfully pays the fair price of the arti- 
cle he purchases ; have those who are unwilling to do so any reason to 
complain "? Have they not invited such conduct. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CURING AND COOKING PICKLED FISH. 

The use of Pickled Fish, such as Mackerel, Salmon, Shad, &c. 
is becoming more general than formerly, and would be still more 
extensive if the proper mode of preparing them for the table was 
better understood. These fish constitute not only a salutary diet, 
but in many cases makes a very beneficial change in our food. 

Whoever will give the following directions a fair trial will be- 
come sensible of their value: 

First. The fish should be kept covered by the pickle by means 
of a flat stone or slate, laid on them. The oil, or animal fat, 
which floats on the top of the cask, should not be removed, as it 
prevents the fish from rusting; but in taking the fish from the 
barrel or keg, this oil ought to be put aside, care being taken not 
to let the fish touch it. Secondly The fish should be washed 
clean, then put to soak in a large quantity of water for eight or 
ten hours, with the flesh side down. The time of soaking may be 
varied to suit the palate. It must again be washed clean, put it 
to soak six or eight hours in milk, (if you have it) then dry it by 
the fire. Thirdly When dry lay it on the gridiron, with the flesh 
side downward, over pretty lively coals, for five minutes, or till it 
is moderately browned, then turn it with a plate, or some flat in- 
strument that will not break the skin, and let it remain over the 
coals ten or fifteen minutes, or till it is cocked sufficiently. Slide 
it off the gridiron into the dish, and strip off the backbone with a 
broad knife: pat the fish, to cause the thick part of the fish to 
absorb the fat from the belly part; use no butter then you will 
enjoy all the flavor and juices of the fish. 

If a Mackerel or Shad so prepared does not relish, it must be 
more the fault of the palate, than of the food. How many arti- 
cles, capable of being made into excellent dishes, are lost or 
spoiled from want of care and skill in dressing them.

ANCHOVY BUTTER. Wash your 
anchovies carefully, take out the lames, and 
dry them; then pound them in a mortar 
until they are reduced to a paste; and mix 
this paste with double the quantity of fresh 
butter. 

ANCHOVIES, BUTTER OF. Wash

in a mortar xvitli fresh butteY till quite smooth, 
and rub it through a sieve. 

ANCHOVY PASTE. Pound them in a 
mortar, then rub it through a line sieve; pot 
it, cover it xvith clarified butter, and keep it 
in a cool place. If you hax e essence of ancho- 
vy, you may make anchovy paste extempore, 
by rubbing the essence xvith as much llour as 
will make a paste. Mem. This is merely 
mentioned as the means of making it imme- 
diately ; it xv ill uot- keep. 

AN CHO VY POWDER. Pound the fish 
in a mortar, nib them through a sieve, and

powder, and put into a well-stopped bottle, it 
will keep for years; it is a very savoury 
relish, sprinkled on bread and butter for a 
sandwich, &c. See Oyster Powder. 

ANCHOVY TOAST. (1) Cut some 

thin slices of bread about the length and 
breadth of a linger; fry them in oil. Place

add, while pounding the anchovies, a little 
iiuide mn.-tard and curry [xnvder, or a few 
grains of ( 'aycnne, or a little mace or oilier 
.-pic.-, li ma;. In- made still moi e savoury, by 
frying the toast in clariiied butter. N.B. 
Keep your aiichoxies xxell covered; first tie 
doxvn your jar xvith bladder moistened xvith 
vinegar, and then xvi|xd dry; tie leather 
over that: when you ojx-.i a jar, moisten the 
bladder, and it will come oil easily; as soon

large apples into slices, put them into a jug, 
and pom' a quart of boiling water over them ; 
cover the jug. When quite cold, strain and 
sweeten it, and add a little lemon-juice. 

APRICOTS IN BRANDY. Weigh 
equal quantities of loaf sugar and of apricots ; 
scald them, and take off the skins. Clarify 
and boil the sugar, put the huh into it, arid 
let it remain for two or three days; put the 
apricots into glasses. Mix with the sirup 
the best pale brandy, half and half, and pour 
it over the apricots and keep them closely 
covered. Peaches' 'and nectarines may Iv 
done iu the same wa\ . 



APRICOTS, CHARLOTTE OF. 

Choose twenty-four fine, plump, but not too 
ripe, apricots, pare and divide them into 
eight parts, toss them up in a quarter of a 
pound of fine sugar, and two ounces of warm 
butter; in the meantime line a mould as di- 
rected (see Charlotte) ; pour in the apri- 
cots, and finish as usual. When turned on 
your dish, cover it lightly with apricot mar- 
malade, and serve it immediately. 

APRICOTS TO DRY. Pare die apri- 
cots, and carefully take out the st< >nes ; blanch 
the kernels, and put them into the apricots; 
strew over a pound of fruit the same quantity 
of finely-pounded loaf sugar, and let them 
stand till the sugar has extracted the juice, 
then boil all together gently; when the fruit 
is tender, take it out with care, and boil the 
sirup till very rich ; pour it over tlie fruit, 
and in three days put it upon dishes, and dry 
them in the sun under garden glasses, turning 
them once or twice a-day, to keep the shape 
as round as possible. Any inferior apricots 
may be cut down and boiled in the sirup, for 
tarts. 

APRICOT MARMALADE. Take 
some fine apricots, and choose from amongst 
diem those which are of the deepest yellow 
and the ripest, (they must not Ix: too ripe.) 
Peel them, take out the stones, and chop them 
up; weigh twelve pounds of them and put 
them into a preserving-pan, with nine pounds 
of powder sugar ; place your pan over a quick 
fire, and keep your preparation constantly 
stirring with a long wooden spoon. To find 
out when tlie marmalade is sufficiently done, 
let a few drops fall into a glass of cold water, 
and if they do not spread in tlie water your 
marmalade is ready to put into pots. An- 
other method of ascertaining when your mar- 
malade is done is by taking some on die end of 
your finger and thumb, and just rub them to- 
gether, and if on separating them you find the 
marmalade forms a thread, it is sufficiently 
done. 

APRICOTS A LA PORTUGAISE. 

Take a dozen of ripe apricots, cut them in 
half, and take out tlie stones ; place them on 
a silver plate, and pour over some, clarified 
sugar, with a little water; put them on a 
stove without covering them; when suffi- 
ciently done, take them from the fire, and 
strew sus-ar over; then put on the lid of the 
baking-pan under the (ire, to make them of a 
good color. 

APRICOTS, WHOLE. Choose tlie fin- 
est yellow, but not too ripe, apricots; take 
off the stalks, prick them on each side \vitl> 
a pin, make an incision with the point of 
a knife, tlmnigh which extract die stone.

Then put them on tin; fire with as much wa- 
ter as will cover them, until near boiling, 
when, if soft, the apricots should 1 thrown 
into cold water ; take care tliev are all equal- 
ly tender. Drain them on a hurdle, and in 
the meantime clarify and boil some sugar 
to the degree you require; put in a little 
water, and when it boils remove it from tin; 
fire, and add to it the fruit, and having given 
them a few boilings together, let them cool, 
then drain and place them in your compotiers. 

ARTICHOKES AND ALMONDS. 

Take half a pound of sweet almonds blanch- 
ed and beat fine, will) two tea spoonfuls 
of orange-flower or rose water; then take 
a quart of cream, and boil it with a small 
quantity of cinnamon and mace; sweeten it 
with fine sugar, and mix it with the almonds ; 
stir them together, and strain it through a 
sieve. Let the cream cool, and thicken il 
with the yolks of six eggs; then !^iniish a 
deep dish, and lay paste at die bottom ; then 
put in shred artichoke bottoms, IM-IIII; tilst 
boiled ; uini ii|x>n these a little melted butter. 
shred citron, and candied orange; repeating 
the same until the dish is nearly full, then 
pour in the cream, and bake it without a lid. 
When it is baked, grate sugar over it, and 
serve it hot. Half an hour will serve to 
bake it. 

ARTICHOKES BOILED. Soak them 
in cold water, wash them well, then put them 
into plenty of boiling water, with a handful 
of salt, and let them Ixiil gently till they are 
tender, which will take an hour and a half, 
or two hours: the surest way to know when 
they are done enough, is to draw out a leaf; 
trim them and drain them on a sieve; and 
send up melted butter with them, which some 
put into small cups, so that each guest may 
have one. 

ARTICHOKES TO BOIL. Cut off the 

euilks cI'Mse to the bottom, wash them well, 
and let tliem lie for some hours in cold wa- 
ter; put them on in liling water with a 
little salt in it, cover the pan closely, and 
boil them an hour and a half. If they are 
old, and have not been fresh gathered, they 
will take a longer time to boil. Melted but- 
ed with them in a sauce-tureen. 

ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS, TO DRY 

AND I'ICKI.K. Half boil the artichokes, 
strip off the leaves, and pull out the i-lmke; 
put the bottoms into small jars, and cover 
them with a cold boiled brine of salt and 
water ; put melted mutton suet on the top to 
exclude the air, and tie bladder over them. 
To dry tliem, they are U.iled as for eating, 
the leaves and choke pulled out , and the bot- 
toms dried upon dishes in an oven, and then 



kept in paper bags. When to be dressed, 
tliey must be laid into warm water, and soak- 
ed for two or three hours ; they may then be 
plain boiled, and eaten with melted butter, 
or stewed in gravy with a little mushroom 
catsup, pepper, and salt, and thickened with 
a bit of butter rolled in flour. They are a 
great improvement to all made dishes and 
meat pies. 

ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS, PICKLED. 

Boil the artichokes till the leaves can be pull- 
ed off without breaking the bottoms; leave 
on the part called the choke, set them aside 
till cold, then put tliem into wide-mouthed 
bottles. Boil, in vinegar, some salt, pepper, 
mace, and sliced nutmeg, and, when cold, 
pour it over the artichokes ; tie bladder over 
the bottles. 

ARTICHOKES, JERUSALEM. (1) 

Are boiled and dressed in the various ways di- 
rected for potatoes. N. B They should be 
covered with thick melted butter, or nice 
white or brown sauce. 

ARTICHOKES, JERUSALEM. (2) 
They must be neatly peeled, and boiled very 
gently by the side of the stove, with a little 
salt in the water ; when done (but not too 
much, or they will not look well) place them 
on the dish, and serve with plain butter, or 
any other sauce you please. 

ARTICHOKES, JERUSALEM, TO 
FRICASSEE. Wash and scrape or pare 
them ; boil tliem in milk and water till they 
are soft, which will be from a quarter to half 
an hour. Take them out and stew them a 
f(*w minutes in the following sauce: Roll a 
bit of butter, the size of a walnut, in flour, 
mix it with half a pint of cream or milk ; 
season it with pepper, salt, and grated nut- 
meg. They may be served plain boiled, 
with a little melted Initter poured over 
them. Scorzonera is fricasseed in the same 
manner. 

ARROW -ROOT. Mix with two or 
three tablc-epoonfuls of arrow-root half a 
pint of cold water ; let it stand for nearly a 
quarter of an hour, pour off" the water, and 
stir in some pounded sugar; boil a pint of 
milk, and pour it gradually upon the arrow- 
root, stirring it one way all the time. Or 
it may be made with water in which lemon- 
peel has been boiled, and then a glass of Port 
or white wine and a little nutmeg stirred 
into it. 

ASPARAGUS. Set a stew-pan with 
plenty of water in it on the fire; sprinkle a 
handful of salt in it ; let it boil, and skim it; 
then put in your asparagus, prepared thus: 



ASP

BAC 



'scrape all the stalks till they are perfectly 
clean ; throw tlicm into a pan of cold water as 
you scrape them; when they are all done, tie 
them up in little bundles, of about a quarter 
of a hundred each, with bass, if you can get 
it, or tape (string cuts them to pieces ; ) cut 
off the stalks at the bottom that they may be 
all of a length, leaving only just enough to 
serve as a handle fur the green part ; when 
they are tender at the stalk, which will be 
in from twenty to thirty minutes, they are 
done enough. Great care must be taken to 
watch the exact time, of their becoming ten- 
der ; take them up just, at that instant, and 
they will have their live flavor and color: 
a minute or two mure boiling destroys both. 
While the asparagus is boiling, toast a round 
of a quartern loaf, about half an inch thick; 
brown it delicately on both sides; dip it 
lightly in the liquor the asparagus was boiled 
in, and lay it in the middle of a dish: melt 
some butter, then lay in the asparagus upon 
the toast, which must project beyond the as- 
pari^'V. that the company may see there is 
a teas*. 

ASPARAGUS, BOILED. Scrape and 
lie them in small bundles; cut them even, 
boil them quick in salt and water; lay ti:em 
on a toast dipped in the water the asparagus 
was boiled in ; pour over them melted butter. 

ASPARAGUS AND EGGS. Toast a 
slice of bread, butter it, and lay it on a dish; 
butter some eggs thus : take four eggs, beat 
them well, put them into a sauce pan with 
two ounces of butter, and a little salt, until 
of a sufficient consistence, and lay them on 
the toast; meanwhile boil some asparagus 
tender, cut the ends small, and lay them on 
the eggs. 

ASPARAGUS, FRENCH. Boil it, and 
chop small the heads and tender part of the 
stalks, together with a boiled onion; add a 
little salt and pepper, and the beaten yolk of 
an egg ; beat it up. Serve it on sippets of 
toasted bread, and pour over it a little melt- 
ed butter. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. (See Soupt.) 

ASPICK. Take a knuckle of veal, a 
knuckle of ham, a thick slice of beef, and if 
they will not make your jelly stilf enough, 
add two calf's feet, or some swards of bacon 
rasped ; put them into a sauce-pan with a pint 
of rich stock, and sweat it over a stove till 
reduced to a glaze, then moisten it with stock, 
boil and skim it well. Put to it two onions, 
two carrots, salt, parsley , seal! inns, tour cloves, 
two bay leaves, and a clove of garlick ; let 
the whole stew fur seven hours, then strain off 
the liquor or consomme. Bre;dt (bur eggs 



into a stewpan, and put to them llie consomme 
when cold, the juiee of two lemons, and two 
spoonfuls of tarragon, and beat it with a 
whisk over the lire till near boiling, and when 
it does so, remove \rnir stew-pan to a smaller 
fire, and place fire on the lid fur half an hour; 
then pass it through a wet napkin doubled. 
If the jelly is not sufficiently clear, clarify it 
a second tiiiip. 1'uta layer of this jelly, about 
half an inch thick, at the bottom of an aspick 
mould, garnish it with truffles, whites of eggs, 
sprigs of parsley, &c. according to your taste, 
|K)ur in another half inch of the jelly, while 
liquid, with great care, so as not to discom- 
pose jour garnish, then put either calf's 
brains, breasts of fowl, veal sweetbreads, 
cocks' coiulis. kidneys, fat livers, or game. 
Be sure to lay \\hale\er \ou may use, as equal 
and smooth as possible, then fill up your mould 
with jelly, and let it stand till t-et. When 
wanted, dip the mould in hot water an in- 
stant, place your dish on the top and turn it

BACCHIC CREAM. (See Cream.) 
BACCHIC SAUCE. (See Sauce.) 

BACON . Cover a pound of nice streaked 
bacon or salt pork witli cold water, let it boil 
gently for three-quarters of an hour ; take it 
up, scrape the under side \\cll, and cut off 
the rind: grate a crust (if bread not only on 
the top, but all over it, and put it before the 
fire for a few minutes: it must not be there 
too long, or it will dry it and spoil it. Two 
pounds will require about an hour and a half, 
according to its thickness; the heck or gam- 
mon being very thick, will take more. The 
boiling of bacon is a very simple subject to 
comment u|x>n; but our main object is to 
teach common cooks the art of dressing com- 
mon food in the best manner. Bacon is 
sometimes as salt as salt can make it, there- 
fore Wore it is boiled it must be soaked in 
warm water for an hour or two, changing 
the water mice; then pare oil' the rusty and 
smoked part, trim it nicely on the under side, 
and scr:i|x! the rind as clean as possible. 
Mem. Bacon is an extravagant article in 
housekeeping; there is often twice as much 
dressed as need be: when it is sent to ta- 
ble as an accompaniment to boiled poultry

BAIN MARIE. A flat vessel, contain- 
ing Ixiiling water, meant to hold other sauce- 
pans, either lor purposes of cookery or to keep

the heat of dishes by the bain marie is this, 
that no change is effected in the flavor of 
the ingredients. 

BALM BEER. (See Beer.)

water, and Jet it boil for five minutes; pour 
off this water, and add to it two quarts of 
boiling water: boil it to two pints, and strain 
it. The almve is simple barley water. To 
a quart of this is frequently added two ounces 
.sliced; the same of raisins, stoned ; 
half an ounce of liquorice, sliced and bruised; 
and a pint of water. Boil it till it is re- 
duced to a quart, and strain. Obs. These

BECHAMELLE. Reduce some sauce 
tournee over a good fire, moisten with chick- 
en broth or consomme, constantly stirring to 
prevent its catching ; when of the proper con- 
sistence, add two glasses of boiling cream, 
continue stirring ; pass it through a hair sieve 
and serve. 

BECHAMEL, OR WHITE SAUCE. 
Cut in square pieces, half an inch thick, two 
|X)inids of lean veal, half a pound of lean ham ; 
melt in a steupan two ounces of butter; 
when melted, let the wht le simmer unlil it 
is ready to catch at the bottom (it requires 
great attention, as, if it happen to catch at 
tlie bottom of the stewpan, it will s|xjil the 
look of your sauce) ; then add to it three 
table-spoonfuls of flour; when well mixed, 
add to it tliree pints of broth or water (pour 
a little at a time, that the thickening be 
smooth) ; stir it until it boil ; put the stew- 
pan on the corner of the stove to boil gently 
for two hours ; season it with four cloves, 
one onion, twelve pepper-corns-, a blade of 
mace, a few mushrooms and a fagot made 
of parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf. 
Let the sauce reduce to a quart", skim the fat 
olF, and strain it through a tamis cloth. To 
make a bechamel sauce, add to a quart of 
tlc above a pint of good cream ; stir it until 
it is reduced to a good thickness; a few 
mushrooms give a good flavor to tliat sauce; 
strain it through a tamis cloth. 

BEEF. The names of the various pieces, 
according to the method of dividing the car- 
cass, are as follows: The hind quarter con- 
tains the Sirloin ; Rump; Edge-lxine; But- 
tock, or Round; Mouse Buttock ; Veiny 
Piece; Thick Flank; Thin Flank; Leg 
Ran; Legs; Fore Rib; Fixe [libs. The 
fore quarter contains the Middle Rib of four 
ribs; Chuck of three ribs; Shoulder, or Leg- 
of-Mutton Piece, containing a part of the 
Blade-bone'; Brisket; Clod; Neck End, or 
Sticking Piece; Shin; Check. Besides 
these are thy Tongue and Pa!a:e. 'i he En- 
trails consist of die Heart; Sweetbreads; 
Kidneys; Skirts; and three kinds of Tripe, 
the Double, the Roll, and the Red Tripe. 

Ox beef is considered the bust. The flesh 
should feel tender, be fine in the grain, and 
of a bright red color, nicely marbled or mix- 
ed with fat. The fat should be white, rather 
than of a yellow color. 

Heifer beef is excellent when finely fed, 
and is most suitable for small families. The 
bone should be taken out of a round of beef 
Ijeforc it is salted, and it must be washed, 
skewered, ;uid bound round firmly before be- 
ing l>oiled. Salt beef should !>e put on with

plenty of cold water, and when it boils the 
cum removed. It is then kept simmering 
for (tome hours. A piece weighing fifteen 
pounds will require three hours and a half to 
boil. Carrots and turnips for garnishing 
should be put on to boil with the beef. If 
in the least tainted, a piece of charcoal may 
be boiled with it. 

Wlien beef is to be kept any length of time, 
it should be carefully wi|)ed every day. In 
warm weather, wood vinegar is an excellent 
pivsei \ative: it is put all over the meat with 
a liriu-li. To protect tile meat from flies, it 
max ! .-prinkle/l oxer with pepper. Tainted 
meat may IK- re>t<>rcd by washing in cold 
water, afterwards in strong chamomile tea, 
after which it may IK- sprinkled with salt and 
used thr t'llluu iui: day, first washing it 
in cold water. Roughfy pounded charcoal 
rubbed all over the meat also restores it when 
tainted. In Scotland meat is frequently kept 
a. fortnight smothered in oatmeal, and care- 
fully wi|M>d every day; and if it should be a 
little tainted, it is soaked some hours before 
it is used, in <>;itm-.il and water. 

These directions equally apply to all sorts 
of meat. The sirloin is the prime joint tor 
Whrii to be used, it should be 
washed, then dried with a clean cloth, and 
the fat covered over with a piece of white (Mi- 
ner tied on with thread. Tile spit should be 
kept at all times exceedingly clean: it must 
lie wiped dry immediately after it is drawn 
from tin- meat, and uaslied and scoured every 
time it is used. Care should be taken to bal- 
ance the roast properly upon the spit, l>ut, if 
\ li.'lil. il is better to make it equal 
by fastening on a leaden-headed skew r linn 
it again. Tlie fire slioulil be pre- 
pired by putting on plenty of coals at the 
back. When put down, it should be about 
ten inches from tli- lire, and gradually drawn 
nearer. It is first basted witli a little butter 
or fresh dripping, and then well basted will) 
iis nun fat all the time it is roasting. Ten 
minute- I let' ne >.-i -\ iii_'. it .-houlil lie sprinkled 
with a little salt, then dredged with flour, and 
basted till it is frothed. When it is drawn 
from the spit some jji-avy will run out, to

watcr poured al .>ng (In- hone: the beef is tlien 
ganiished with plenty of finely scraped horse- 
radish. A sirloin, x\i ijiin.; aliout tiltei-n 
pounds, should lie roasted for three hours and 
a half. A thinner piece of the same weight 
requires only three hours. In cold weather 
meat requires longer roast in;: than in warm, 
and if newly killed tlum if it lias been kept.

it into pieces of three or four ounces each ; put 



three or four ounces of beef drippings, and 
mince a couple of large onion?, and put them 
into a large deep stewpan ; as soon as it is 
quite hot. Hour die meat, put it into the stew- 
pan, keep stirring it with a wooden spoon; 
when it h:is been on about ten minutes, dredge 
it with flour, and keep doing so till you have 
stirred in as much as you think will thicken 
it; then cover it with boiling water (it will 
take about a gallon), adding it by degrees, 
and stirring it together ; skim it when it boils, 
and then put in one drachm of ground black 
pepper, two of allspice, and two bay leaves; 
set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a dis- 
tance over it and let it stew very slowly for 
about three hours; when you find the meat 
sufficiently tender, put it into a tureen, and 
it is ready for table. 

BEEF ALAMODE. (2) Take the 
bone out of a small round of fine ox beef, cut 
some fat bacon in long strips, dip them into 
common and shallot vinegar mixed, and roll 
them in the following seasoning: Grated nut- 
meg, black and Jamaica pepper, one or two 
cloves, and some salt, parsley, chives, lemon- 
lliyme, notted marjoram, and savoury, shred 
quite small. Lard the beef very thickly, bind 
it firmly w ilh ta]>e, and rub die outside with 
the seasoning. Put it into a saucepan, with 
iln- rind of a lemon, four large onions, die nil 
part of three or f iir carrots, and two turnips 
cut into dice; add a tea-cupful of strong ale 
and one of vinegar; let it stew -f;r six < r eight 
li.uirs, turning it two or three times. Half 
.in hour U'fore serving, takeout die beef and 
ililes, skim oil' the fat, strain the sauce, 
and thicken it with a little flonr-aud-water 
mixed smooth, add a tea-cupful of 1'ort v. irto, 
return it all into tile pot, and let it boil. 

BEEF ALAMODE. (3) Take a rump 
or piece of beef, bone it, beat it well and lard 
it with tat Ixicon, then \M it into a stewpan 
with some rind of baron, a calf's foot, an 
onion, carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs, a bay 
leaf, thyme, a clove of garlic, some cloves, 
salt, and pepper, pour over tile whole a glass 
of water, let it stew oxer a slow fire for six 
hours at least. A clean cloth should be 
placed over the stew pan before the lid is 
pit on, which must !* carefully closed. 
When it is done, strain the gravy through a 
sieve, clear off the fat, and serve. 

BEEF ALADAUBE. Take a round, 
a lump, or a veiny piece of beef, lard it with 
bacon, half roast it, or fry it brown; put it 
into a .-tr\x|<an or a pot that will just hold 
it ; add some gravy, an onion stuck with 
cloves, half a pint nf white wine, a gill of 
vinegar, a bunch of swoet herbs, pepper, 
cloves, mace, ami salt ; cover it down very 
close, let it hut just simmer till it is tender ;

lake two ox palates, two sweetbreads, truf- 
fles, morels, artichoke bottoms, stew them all 
together in some gravy, atid pour over the 
beef; have ready some forced meat balls fried, 
make some long, others round, dip some sip- 
.pets into baiter, fry and cut them three cor- 
ner ways, and stick them into the meat ; lay 
the balls round the dish. 

BEEF ALABRAISE. (1) Bone a 
rump of beef; lard it very thickly with salt 
pork seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, 
and allspice, and season the beef with pepper 
and salt ; put some slices of bacon into the 
bottom of the pan, with some whole black pep- 
per, a little allspice, one or two bay leaves, two 
onions, a clove of garlic, and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. Put in the beef, and lay over it 
some slices of bacon, two quarts of weak 
stock, and half a pint of white wine. Cover 
it closely, and let it stew between six and 
seven hours. Sauce for the beef is made of 
part of the liquor it has been stewed in, 
strained, and thickened with a little flour and 
butter, adding some green onions cut small, 
and pickled mushrooms. It is poured hot 
over the beef. 

BEEF ALABRAISE. (2) After a 
rump of beef has hung for five or six days, 
bone, and lard it thickly, but so as not to ap- 
pear upon the surface, with bits of salt pork 
or ham cut about half an inch square, and 
rolled in the following seasoning well mixed: 
Finely minced onion, parsley, thyme, a lit- 
tle garlic, pepper, and salt. What is left over 
of the seasoning add to a pint of vinegar, one 
of Port wine, and a tea-cupful of salad oil ; 
steep the beef in this for one night ; the fol- 
lowing day paper it, and roast it in a cradle 
spit. Baste it well, and serve it with a thick 
brown gravy. A little lemon-juice and sliced 
pickled cucumbers may be added. Garnish 
with slices of boiled carrot and scraped horse- 
radish. 

BEEF ALANGLAISE. Take a rump 
of beef, or any piece you like better of the 
same size ; tie it up neatly with packthread, 
and put it into a stewpan with two or three 
carrots, a parsnip, three or four onions, a 
bunch of parsley and green onions, a clove of 
garlic, a bay leaf, thyme, and basil ; moisten 
with some stock or water, season, and let 
the beef stew gently till half done, then put in 
a few small cabbages, prepared in the follow- 
ing manner; boil a large cabbage, and hav- 
ing squeezed it perfectly dry, take off the 
leaves one by one, and put within each leaf 
a little veal or other forcemeat, suirounding 
it with three or four more of tlie leaves, in 
such a manner as to form little cabbages, 
something larger than an egg ; tie these with 
packthread, and let them be stewed with the 



beef. When die whole is done, clean away 
the outside loose fat, and put your beef in a 
dish, cut the little cabbages in half, and place 
them round tile dish, with the cut side out- 
ward. Take a little of the stew, strain it 
through a sieve, and having skimmed off the 
fat, add a little cullis to thicken it. Reduce 
this over the fire to the consistence of a sauce, 
serving it over the meat and cabbages. 

BEEF BALLS. Mince very finely a 
piece of tender beef, fat and lean } mince an 
onion, with some lx>iled parsley; add grated 
bread crumbs, and season with pepper, salt, 
grated nutmeg, and lemon-peel ; mix all to- 
gether, and moisten it with an egg beaten ; 
roll it into balls } flour and fry them in boil- 
ing fresh dripping. Serve them with fried 
bread crumbs, or with a thickened brown 
gravy. 

BEEF BOUILLI. (1) In plain Eng- 
lish, is understood to mean boiled beef ; but 
its culinary acceptation, in die French kitch- 
en, is fresh beef dressed without boiling, and 
only very gently simmered by a slow fire. 
Cooks have seldom any notion, dial good soup 
can be made without destroying a great deal 
of meat ; however, by a judicious regulation 
of die fire, and a vigilant attendance on the 
soup-kettle, this may be accomplished. You 
shall have a tureen of such soup as \\ ill satisfy 
the most fastidious palate, and die meat make 
its appearance at table, at the same time, in 
possession of a full portion of nutritious succu- 
lence. This requires nothing more than to 
stew the meat very slowly (instead of keeping 
die pot boiling a gallop, as common cooks 
too commonly do), and to take it up as soon 
as it is done enough. See " Soup and 
bouilli," " Beef Shin stewed," " Scotch 
barley broth." Meat cooked in this manner 
affords much more nourishment than it does 
dressed in the common way, is easy of diges- 
tion in proportion as it is tender, and an in- 
vigorating, substantial diet, especially valua- 
ble to the poor, whose laborious employments 
require support. 

BEEF BOUILLI. (2) Take a ramp 
of beef, or part of one; bone and tie it togeth- 
er in a neat form, and put it into a pot, with 
any odd bits of butcher's meat you may hap- 
pen to have in die house, eidier beef, veal, or 
mutton; you may add, also, the Ixmes, feet, 
and necks of poultry or game, the meat of 
which has been taken for other dishes ; place 
your pot on a moderate fire, not quite full of 
water, and skim gently. When it has boiled 
a short time, put in some salt, turni) s, six 
carrots, and six onions, into oneof which yon 
should stick three cloves; add a bunch of 
leeks. Let the whole boil gently, till the beef 
is perfectly done ; then take it out, and serve

or with onions or other vegetables. 

BEEF BROSE. After any lar.:- piece 
of beef has been taken out i-l'tltr pot it was 
boiled in, skim off (lie fut with part of the 
liquor, and boil it in a .-:uir,-paM. Have 
ready in a Ixml oatineul that has Uvn toasted 
brown beli.re tlie lire, pour in tlic Ixiiling 
liquor and stir it a little; if too thick, add 
more liquor, and send it to table quite hot. 

BEEF BAKED. Let a buttock of beef 
which has U-t-n in salt about a week, be well 
washed and put into an earthen pan, with a 
pint of water; cover the pan tight w ith two 
or three sheets of foolscap paper let it I take 
four or live hours in a moderately healed

BEEF FILLET IN MADEIRA. Lard 

a good fillet of beef, the same as for roasting, 
join die ends together, and place it in this 
manner in a stew pan, w ith some onions, car- 
rots, and a bouquet garni, some consomme 
and Madeira, cover it with a buttered paper ; 
let i( Ixiil for a moment, and afterwards let 
it boil slowly. Put fire upon tlie top of your 
slew pan. When it is done strain the broth 
through a silk sieve, reduce it, and serve it 
as a sauce to your meat. 

BEEF FILLET ROASTED. This fil- 
let lies only in tlie inside of the sirloin next 

to the chini', and is the tenderest part of the 
<>x ; .-pit this on a small spit, but do not run 
it thnuii','h tlie best pan of the meat: roast i; 
. and Imste it with butter ; catch gravy 
in a dish while the beef is roasting; in tin- 
meantime make a sauce for it with sweet

bit of lean beef, lard it with bacon, seasoned 
widi pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and allspice. 
Put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, 
a glass of white wine, a bundle of parsley, all 
sorts of sweet herbs, a clove of garliek, a 
.-lullot or two, four cloves, pepper and .-alt. 
Wlien the meat is become tender, cover h 
close; skim the sauce well, and strain it. 
Set it on tlie fire, and let it boil till it is re- 
duced to a glaze. Glaze the larded side with 
this, and serve the meat on sorrel sauce.

put in some, cloves, mare, allspice, and whole 
pepper, tied in a muslin, six In 'ads of celery, 
cut an inch long and well washed, a carrot 
or two cut iu slices, two turnips cut in dice, 
a bundle of sweet herbs, some pepper and 
salt, and a crust of bread; stew it till the 
-meat is tender, and then take out the spice, 
herbs, and bread ; have some crusts of French 
roll crisped before the lire, put them in a dish, 
and put the meat, &c. over them. You put 
in two ounces of Scotch barley or rice when 
you put in the herbs;* 

BEEF GRAVY. (See Gravy.) 

BEEF H-BONE. Is to be managed in 
exactly the same manner as the round, but 
will be sooner boiled, as it is not so solid. 
An H-bone of 201bs. will be done enough in 
about four hours ; of lOlbs. in three hours, 
more or less, aa the weather is hotter or 
colder. Be sure the boiler is big enough to 
allow it plenty of water-room: let it be well 
covered with water: set the pot on one side 
of the fire to boil gently : if it boils quick at 
first, no art can make it tender alter. The 
slower it boils, the better it will look, and 
the tenderer it will be. The same accom- 
panying vegetables as in "Beef Salt Round." 
Dress plenty of carrots, as cold carrots are a 
general favorite with cold beef. Mem. 
Epicures say, that the soft, fat-like marrow, 
which lies on the back, is delicious when hot, 
and the hard fat about the upper corner is 
bt-st when cold. 

BEEF HASHED. (1) Take three or 
four on ions, chop them very fine, and put them 
into a stewpan, with a piece of butter and 
a little flour ; stir it over the fire till nearly 
done and well browned; then moisten them 
with a little stock and half a glass of wine, 
adding some salt and coarse pepper ; let them 
stew till they are thoroughly done, and very 
little s:mce remains; then put in the cold 
beef, minced small, and let the whole sim- 
mer till it lias taken the flavor of the onion. 
When yon serve, add a spoonful of mustard 
and a little vinegar. 

BEEF HASHED. (2) Cut some of 
the underdone part of the beef, in slices, 
with some of the fat, put it into a small 
stuwpan, with some onion or shallot, (a 
very little will do), a little water, pep|x-r, 
and salt: boil it till the onion is quite soft, 
tlien put some of the gravy of the meat to it, 
and the hash. , Do not let it boil ; have a 
small hot dish with sippets of bread ready, 
and put the hash into it, but first mix a large 
spoonful of vinegar with it; il'sliallu^vinegar 
is used there will be no need of the onion or 



| raw shallot. You may add a spoonful of 
walnut liquor or catchup. Observe, that it 
is owing to boiling hashes or minces, that 
they get hard. All sort* of stews, or meat 
dressed a second time, should be only sim- 
mered ; and this last only hot through. 

BEEF HAM. Rub a little common salt 
over a piece of beef of about twenty pounds 
weight; take out the bone, and in one or two 
days, rub well into the beef the following in- 
gredients, finely pounded and well mixed: 
two ounces of sal-prunella, four oiuices of 
brown sugar, six ounces of bay salt, one 
ounce of white pepper, and of cloves and nut- 
meg, a quarter of an ounce each ; then strew- 
over it half a pound of common salt. Let it 
lie fifteen days, turning it daily. It i.s then 
hung up; or when taken out of the pickle, it 
may be boiled, and allowed to stand till cold 
in the water in which it was boiled; or it 
may be baked in a deep dish, covered with 
a coarse paste. 

BEEF HEART, TO ROAST. Wash 
it well, and clean all the blood carefully from 
the pipes: parboil it ten or fifteen minutes in 
boiling water; drip the water from it; put 
in a stuffing which has been made of bread 
crumbs, minced suet or butter, sweet marjo- 
ram, lemon thyme, and parsley, season- 
ed with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Put it 
down to roast while hot, baste it well with 
butter, froth it up, and serve it with melted 
butter and vinegar; or with gravy in the 
dish, and current jelly in a sauce-tureen. 
To hash it, follow the directions given fijr 
hare. 

BEEF HUNG, BURGESS'S METH- 
OD OF BOILING. Hung beef for grat- 
ing should be put on in boiling water, and, 
to preserve the color, kept boiling as fast as 

Cible. Allow for six pounds of beef one 
and a half. It will keep good for a 
length of time. 

BEEF, HUNTING. Rub well into a 
round of beef weighing about forty pounds, 
three ounces of saltpetre ; let it stand five or 
six hours; pound three ounces of allspice, 
one of black pepper, and mix them with two 
pounds of salt, and seven ounces of brown su- 
gar. Rub the beef all over with the salt and 
spices, let it remain fourteen days, and every 
other day turn and rub it with the pickle ; 
then wash off the spices, and put it into a 
deep pan. Cut small nearly six pounds of 
beef suet, put some into the bottom of the 
pan, but the greater part upon the top of the 
beef. Cover it with a coarse paste, and 
bake it eight hours. When cold, take off 
the crust, and pour off the gravy. It will 
keep good for three months. Preserve the

gravy, as a little of it improves the flavor of 
nashes, soups, or any made dishes. 

BEEF KIDNEY. Take some kidneys, 
cut them into thin slices, and broil them wiih 
apiece of butter, some salt, pepper, parsley, 
and green onions, and a clove of garlick, the 

whole should Iw shred fine; when they are 
sufficiently done, take them off t lie lire (they 
should not broil too long, or they will become 
tough); add, when you .serve them, a few 
drops of vinegar and a little cullis. Beef 
kidneys may likewise be served, with shallot 
sauce, or sauce piquante. 



BEEF 
Sauce.) 



KIDNEY SAUCE. (See 



BEEF MINCED. (1) Take some cold 
roasted fillet of beef, cut out all the fat and 
suet, then chop the meat as fine as possible, 
and put it into a reduced Spanish sauce made 
txiilinu' hot; when ready to serve, add a bit 
of butter to it. Serve your mince with soft 
boiled egga round it, or with pieces of toast- 
ed bread. 

BEEF MINCED. (2) Mince your 
beef MTV small ; put it into a saucepan with 
a little gravy and a little of the fat of 
fowl or any other fat, moisten it with some 
stock and a little white wine; season accord- 
ing to your taste, then let it simmer over a 
gentle fire till it is sufficiently done. 

BEEF OLIVES. Cut the beef into long 
thin steaks; prepare a forcemeat made of 
bread-crumbs, minced beef suet, chopped 
parsley, a little grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, 
pep|>er, and salt; bind it with the yolks of 
eggs beaten ; put a layer of it over each steak ; 
roll and tie them with thread. Fry them 
lightly in beef dripping; put them in a stew- 
pan with some good brown gravy, a glass of 
while wine, and a little Cayenne; thicken it 
with a little flour and butter; cover the pan 
closely, and let them stew gently an hour. 
Bctiire serving, add a tahle-spnonnil of mush- 
room catchup; garnish with cut pickles. 

BEEF AND OYSTER SAUSAGES. 
Scald three-quarters of a pint of oysters in 
their own liquor; take them out and chop them 
finely ; mince one pound of beef and mutton, 
and three-quarters of a pound of beef suet; 
add the ovstcrs, and season with salt, pepper, 
mace, and two cloxcs |xmuded; Ix-at up tuo 
egifs, and mix them well with the other ingre- 
dients, and (Kirk it closely into ajar. NVheu 
to be used, roll it into the form of small sau- 
sages; dip them into the yolk of .in egg beat- 
en up; strew grated bread crumbs over them, 
or dust with llour, and fry them in fresh 
dripping. Serve themujxm fried bread hot. 



BEEF PRESSED. Salt a piece of bris- 
ket (thin |Kirt of the flank) or the tops of die 
ribs, with salt and s:dl|>cire, five days, then 
lx>il it gently till extremely tender; put it 
under a <>ivat weight, or in a cheese press, 
till peifertK cold. It eats excellently cold, 
and for sandw idles. 

BEEF POTTED. Take three pounds 
of lean beef, salt it two or three days witii 
half a pound of common salt, and half an 
ounce of saltpetre; divide it into pieces of a 
pound each, and put it into an- earthen pan 
just sufficient to contain it; pour in half a 
pint of w;fter ; cover it close with paste, and 
set it in a very slow oven for four hours: when 
taken from the oven pour the gravy from it 
into a basin, shred the meat fine, moisten it 
with tlie gravy poured from the meat, and 
pound it thoroughly in a marble mortar with 
fresh butter, till it beoomei a fine paste, sea- 
son it with black pepper and allspice, or 
cloves pounded/ or grated nutmeg ; put it in 
pots, press it down as close as possible, put 
a weight on it, and let it stand all night; 
ii.-xt day, when it is quite cold, cover it a 
quarter of an inch thick with clarified butter, 
and tie it over with paper. 

BEEF SALT ROUND. As this is 
too large for a moderate family, we shall 
write directions for the dressing half a round. 
Get the tongue side. Skewer it up tight and 
round, and tie a fillet of broad tape round it, 
to keep the skewers in their places. Put it 
into plenty of cold water, and carefully 
catch the scum as soon as it rises : let it boil 
till all the scum is removed, and thru put the 
boiler on one side of the fire, to keep sim- 
mering slowly till it is done. Haifa round 
of 151bs. will take about three hours: ifit 
weighs more, give it more time. When you 
take it up, if any stray scum, &c. sticks to 
it that has escaped the vigilance of your skim- 
mer, wash it off with a paste-brush: garnish 
the dislies with carrots and tuniips. Send 
up carrots, turnips, and parsnips, or gteens 
&c. on separate dishes. Peas pudding, and 
MY PUDDING, are all very proper accom- 
paniments. N.B. The outside slices, 
which are generally too much salted and too 
much 1 mi led, will make a very good relish as 
potted beef. For using up the remains of a 
joint of boiled beef, see also Bubble and 
Squeak. 

BEEF RAGOUT. Take a rump of beef, 
cut the meat from the bone, flour and fry it, 
pour over it a little boiling water, about a 
pint of small beer; add a carrot or two, an 
ouion stuck with cloves, some whole pepper, 
salt, a piece of lemou-|)ccl, a bunch of sweet 
herbs; let it stew an hour, then add some 
good gravy ; when tin- meat is tender take it

out, strain the sauce, thicken it with a little 
flour; add a little celery ready boiled, a little 
catchup, put in the meat, just simmer it up. Or 
the celery may be omitted, and the ragout en- 
riched by adding mushrooms fresh or pickled, 
artichoke-lx>ttoms boiled and quartered, and 
liard yolks of eggs. A piece of Hank, or 
any piece that can Ix; cut free from bone, 
will do instead of the rump. 

BEEF RISSOLES. Chop finely a 
|x>un:l <;f lean tender lieef, and a quarter of a 
pound of beef met; pound them in a marble 
mortar ; mix with it a quarter of a pound of 
grated bread, a little onion, and a head of 
gilt-lick bruised ; season with salt and pepper; 
bind it with three eggs well beaten ; imke it 
up into small cakes, fry them of a light brown, 
then stew them in gravy for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. 

BEEF RIBS BONED AND ROLLED. 
When you have kept two or three ribs of 
beef till quite tender, take out the bones, and 
skewer it as round as possible (like a fillet 
of veal) : before they roll it, some cooks egg 
it, and sprinkle it with veal stuffing. As the 
meat is more in a solid mass, it will require 
more time at the fire ; a piece of tenor twelve 
pounds weight will not be well and thoroughly 
roasted in less than four and a half hours. 
For the first half hour, it should not be less 
than twelve inches from the fire, that it may 
get gradually warm to the centre: the last 
half hour before it will be finished, sprinkle 
a little salt over it; and if you wish to froth 
it, flour it, &c. 

BEEF RUMP BAKED. Take a rump 
of beef, what size you please, bone and lard 
it, season it with salt and fine spices put it 
into a stewpan just large enough to hold it, 
together with half a pint of white wine, some 
green onions, mushrooms, and shallots ; some 
lean bacon is an improvement. Close the 
edges of the pan with a strong paste ; let it 
stew in an oven for five or six hours according 
to the size of your meat, then serve it with 
its own sauce strained. You may dress a sir- 
loin in die same way. 

BEEF RUMP TO STEW. (1) Bind 
the beef tightly, stick in four cloves, and put 
it in a saucepan, with three quarts of water, 
a quarter of an ounce of black pepper half 
beaten, some salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and three anchovies ; turn it often, and when 
lialf done take it out, pour off the liquor ; put 
in the beef again, with a pint of 1'oit wine 
and half a pint of table beer made scalding 
hot, and some of the liquor strained ; stew it 
till tender, clwir off the fat, and if the sauce 
is not strong enough, add well-seasoned beef 
gravy ; thicken it with flour nibbed duwn in 



a little cold water. Dish the beef, and pour 
the gravy round it. 

BEEF RUMP TO STEW. (2) Tie 

up the I icrf, and put it on to stew with nearly 
as much cold water as will cover it; add three 
pounds of fat bacon cut into slices, a handful 
of thyme, eight onions, four small carrots, 
two turnips, two or three bay leaves, nn-.i-- 
black pepper, a little allspice, mace, and 
three cloves, a pint of Port wine and one of 
Sherry. Let it stew gently l>etween seven 
and eight hours. Take out the l>eef, strain 
the liquor, and skim off all the fat ; thicken 
it with a little flour rubbed down in cold 
water, boil it up, and pour it over the beef. 
Have ready carrots and turnips, cut accord- 
ing to fancy, and boiled tender in weak gra- 
vy, and put diem round die beef before serv- 
ing. 

BEEF RUMP-STEAKS STEWED. 

The steaks must be a little thicker than for 
broiling: let diem be all die same diickness, 
or some will be done too little, and odiers too 
much. Put an ounce of butter into a stew- 
pan, widi two onions; when die butter is 
melted, lay in die rump-steaks, Jet diem stand 
over a slow fire for five minutes, dien turn 
diem and let die odier side of diem fry for 
five minutes longer. Have ready boiled a 
pint of button onions; they will take from 
half an hour to an hour ; put die liquor diey 
were boiled in to die steaks; if diere is not 
enough of it to cover diem, add brodi or boil- 
ing water, to make up enough for that purpose, 
widi a dozen corns of black pepper, and a 
little salt, and let diem simmer very gently 
for about an hour and a half , and then strain 
off as much of die liquor (about a pint and 
a half) as you think will make die sauce. 
Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan; 
when it is melted, stir in as much flour tu 
will make it into a stiff paste; some add 
diereto a table-spoonful of claret, or Port 
wine, die same of mushroom catchup half a 
tea-spoonful of salt and a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of ground black pepper: add doe 
liquor by degrees ; let it boil up for fifteen 
minutes; skim it, and strain it; serve up die 
steaks widi die onions round the dish,and pour 
die gravy over. Veal cutlets or mutton chops 
may be done die same way, or as veal olives. 

BEEF RUMP-STEAK BROILED 
WITH ONION GRAVY. Peel and slice 
two large onions, put diem into a quart stew- 
pan, with two table-spoonfuls of water ; cover 
die stew pan close, and set it on a slow fire 
till the water lias INI! led away, and the onions 
have got a little browned ; dien add half a 
pint of good brodi, and boil the onions till 
they are tender ; strain the brodi from diem, 
ami chop diem very fine, and season it with

mushroom catchup, pepper, and salt : put the 
onion into it, and let it boil gently for five 
minutes; pour it into the dial), and lay over it 
a broiled rump steak. If instead of broth 
you use good beef gravy, it will be super- 
lative. 



BEEF SAUSAGES. Take two beef 
steaks alxxit tin- size of two liamls, and the 
thickness ot'u linger; heat them well to make 
them tlat, and pare the edges of them ; then 
mince the parings with beef suet, parsley, 
green onions, mushrooms, two shallots, and 
some basil leave.-:, the whole shred fine, and 
mixed into a f >reem:'at with the yolks of tour 
oil;;*; spread this forcemeat on the slices of 

I roll them up in tin- form <>f sausage-" , 
tie ihem up with jxickthrcad, and slew them 
with a little stork, a ula.-s of wine, si imcsalt, 
pcpjxT, an onion stuck with two or three 

carrot, and a parsnip; when they 
are dune, strain the liquor; and, having 
skimmed off the fat, reduce it over the fire 
to the consistence of a since. Take care 
that the sauce is not loo higly flavored, and 
serve it over your san-au r > : or they may lx- 
served with any ragout of vegetables you 
pleaae. To strve dm sausages cold, to make 
a di.-h tor the second course, leduce the sauce 
by lei I ins it boil \\ilii the sausages till almost 
all the f.rt is consumed; then let ihem stand 
to cool with what remains of the sauce ad- 
hering to them, and serve ujxm a napkin. 

BEEF, SHORT OR SPICED. (To 

Ve eaten cold.) Hang up ten or twelve 

pounds of the middle jxirt of a brisket of 
Out fat three or four days, tln-n nib well into 
it llirtv ounces of finely pnwdeivd saltpetre, 
and, if spice is -ipproied of, one ounce of 
alUpici-, ;id half an mince of black pepper; 

.'id all ni^ht, then silt it with throe 
pounds of well-|x>undcd l>ay salt, and half a 
pound of treacle, in which let it remain ten 

Miing il d.iily. When it is to be 
Ixuled, sew it c|,ely in a cloth, let the water 
only Mnmicr. upon no account allowing it to 
Uiil, for nine hours over a slow fire, or u|x>n a 
slo\e. U'hc i taken out of the water, place 
two sticks across ibc |xil,and let the beef stand 
oier die sleam for half an hour, turning il 
from side to Hide, tlten press it with a lieavy 
weight. It must not be taken out of the 
clodi till perfectly cold. 

I'.l. \:V SOUP. (S#eSoMp.) 

I'. I K T, SPRING GARDEN. Cut a 
piece of Ic in leef into thin slices like Scotch 
collopn, lard it thick with bacon, and put il 
into a pan with salt, pcp|>er, mace, two or 
thre.- bay leaves, and a bunch of sue-t herlis ; 
Itike il ; then clear out all the gravy, and (ill 
it up with clarified butter. 
2* 



BEEF TO SALT FOR IMMEDIATE 
USE. Salt a round of beef moderately up- 
on the tops and sides, put it upon sticks, or 
the IIMI^S of a cheese-tub, over a tub of cold 
water, and the silt will be drawn through it, 
so that it will be fit for boiling next day. 

\\OTHER METHOD IS To rub 

for half an hour into any piece of beef a good 
quantity of salt, and let it lie for tlnee or 
four days without touching it, when it may 
be used. 

BKKF SIRLOIN. The noble sirloin of 

alxmt fifteen |x>und>s (if much thicker, the out- 
side u ill lx? done too much before the inside 
is enou.'h), will require to be before the fire 
about three and a half or four hours ; take 
care to spit it evenly, that it may not be 
heavier on one side than the other ; put a little 
clean dripping into the drippingpan, (tie a 
sheet of pa|XT over it to preserve the fat), 
baste it well as soon as it is pat down, and 
e\ei\ quarter of an hour all the time it is 
roasting, till tin- last half hour; then take 
off the paper, and make some gravy for it ; 
stir tile fire and make it clear: to brown and 
froth it, sprinkle a little sill o-'er it, baste it 
with butter, and dredge it with flour; let it 
go a few minutes longer, till the froth rises, 
take it up, put it on the dish, kc. Garnish it 
with hillocks of horse-radish, scraped as fine 
as possible with a very sharp knife. A York- 
shire pudding is an excellent accompaniment. 

BEEF SHIN STEWED. Desire the 

butcher to saw the bone into three or four 
pieces, put it into a stewpan, and just cover 
it with cold wafer; when it simmers, skim 
it clean ; then put in a bundle of sweet herbs, 
a large onion, a head of celery, a do/*n ber- 
ries of black |K<p|N>r, and the same of allspice: 
stew very gently over a sknv fire till the meat 
is tender; this will take from alxnit three 
Iwurs and a half, to four and a half. Take three 
carrots, |x-el an. I cut ihem into small squares ; 
peel and cut ready in small squares a couple 
of turnips, with a couple of dozen of small 
young round silver bulton onions ; boil them, 
till tender; the tnrni|>s and onions will be 
enough in about tiftce-i minutes; the Carrots 
will require alxmt twice as long: drain them 
dry. When tlie beef is quite tender, lake it 
out carefully with a slice, and put it on a dish 
while you thicken apint and a half of the gra- 
vy: to do this, mix three tahle-sptMinfuls of 
Hour with a tea-cupful of the Ix-ef liquor ; stir 
this ill. ii. Highly together till it boils, skim off 
the fkt, strain it through a sieve, and put your 
vcyij|nh|i's in to warm; season will) pepper, 
Kail, and a wine-gfciss of mushroom catchup, 
or Port wine, or both, anu pour 't over the 
beef. Dr. Kitchener commends this dish as 
one of tin; very liest that can he carried to

and, with meat tongs, keep turning them con- 
stantly, till they are done enough ; throw a 
little salt over them a little before taking them 
oft' the fire. Serve them as hot as possible, 
plain, or with a made gravy and sliced on- 
ion, or rub a bit of butter upon the steaks 
the moment of sen-ing. Mutton chops are 
broiled in the same manner. 

BEEF STEAKS, STEWED. Fry the

BEEF, MUTTON, OR VEAL TEA. 

Cut a pound of lean gravy meat into thin 
slices ; put it into a quart and half a pint of 
cold water ; set it over a very gentle fire, 
where it will become gradually warm ; when 
the scum rises, let it continue simmering 
gently for about an hour ; then strain it 
through a fine sieve or a napkin ; let it stand 
ten minutes to settle, and then pour off the 
clear tea. N. B. An onion, and a few 
grains of black pepper, are sometimes added. 
If the meat is boiled till it is thoroughly 
tender, you may mince it and pound it and 
make potted beef.

of water, six pounds of molasses, and three 
ounces of bruised ginger have boiled togeth- 
er for half an hour, two pounds of the outer 
spriirs i if the spruce fir are to be added, and 
boiled for five minutes; the whole is then to

milk-wann, put into the cask, and a tea- 
cupful of good yeast stirred well into it. 
When it has fermented a day or two, it is to 
be bunged up, and the following day bot- 
tled. It will be fit for use in a week. The 
t;ii:^fi- is sometimes omitted, and instead 
of the spruce fir, three ounces of the essence 
may be used, which is to Ix; well whisked, 
together widi the molasses, and a gallon or

of molasses, a tea-cupful of ginger, the fame 
of allspice, three ounces of hops, diree 
ounces ;ind .i half of the essence nf spruce, 
and half a pint of good yeast. The hops, 
ginger, and allspice, must be boiled togeth- 
er till the hops fall to the tattom ; tlie molas- 
ses and spruce are then to be dissolved in a 
bucket-full of the liquor, the whole strain- 
ed into a cask, and the _xea?t \\ell stirred in ; 
when the fermentationfCeases, the cask is 
to be bunged up. 

BEER, BALM. Eleven gallons of

BEER, GINGER. For a ten-gallon 
cask, eleven gallons of water, fourteen 
pounds of sugar, the. juice of eighteen lem- 
ons, and one pound of ginger are alloxved ; 
tlie sugar and water are tailed with the

%* If beer becomes hard or stale, a few 
grains of carbonate of potash added to it 
at the time it is drunk will correct it, and 
make draught beer as brisk as tattled ale.

them into dice and dry them in the oven. 
Make a glaze with the whites of two new- 
laid eggs ; mix tlie almonds and a pinch of 
crisped orange-flowers into this, and put it 
into very small paper cases; do not fill them 
a! HIVC half full, as they rise considerably in 
the oven, and would otherwise fall over and

about ten minutes; whip the whites to a 
strong froth, and mix them lightly with die 
yolks: add a quarter of a pound of dry sifted 
flour and the anise; pour this paste into a 
paper case, eleven inches long by seven wide. 
Bake it in a slow o\en for afx>ut forty or 
fifty minutes, when, if firm, take it out. As

minutes longer, put the flour, and continue 
beating ten minutes more. Butter vour bak- 
ing plates and bake. Caraway or aniseed 
may be added, if you please. 

BISCUITS, BUTTER. Make a paste 
as for sweet biscuits, and when you have 
put in the flour, pour over it eight ounces of 
melted butter, alter it has cooled a little; 
mix them together a short time with a wood- 
en spoon, and put into battered moulds, 
which must only be filled three parts, as the 
paste pulfc up considerably, and would rise 
from the moulds, without care.

the snow of tlie whites should fall. With 
this fill some small buttered moulds, or pa- 
per cases, and bake them in a quick oven to 
a deep yellow, first sprinkling them with su- 
gar. If they are in moulds, turn them out 
when baked; but tley may remain in the

BREAD CRUMBS, FRIED. Rub bread 
that has been baked two days, through an 
iron sieve or cullender ; put them into a stew- 
pan with two ounces of butter ; place it over 
a moderate fire, and stir them with a wooden 
spoon till of a fine gold color; spread them 
on a sieve, and let them stand ten minute* 
to drain, turning them often. 

BREAD, FRENCH. Take half a bushel 
(or six pounds) of flour, put it on the slab, 
make a hole in the centre, in which put two 
ounces of yeast ; make your dough with warm 
water, to about the consistence of briocht; 
work it up well, adding two ounces of salt, 
dissolved in a little warm water; cover, and 
set it in a warm place to rise ; on this part 
of the operation depends the quality of the 
bread. Having left the dough one or two 
hours, (according to the season), knead h 
ayain, and leave it as before, for two hours. 
In the meanwhile, heat the oven, divide the 
dough into eight equal parts, of which form 
as many loaves, into any shape you please; 
put them into the oven as quickly as possible. 
As goon as they are done, rub the crusts with 
a little butter, which will give it a fine yellow 
color. 

BREAD, FRENCH, OR ROLLS. 
Take half a bushel or six pounds of sifted 
flour, knead it into dough, with two quart* 
of milk, three-quarters of a pound of warm 
Ixitter. half a pound of yeast, and two ounces 
of salt ; when the whole is well worked up, 
cover, and leave it to rise. In two hours 
time, form it into rolls, and lay them on 
tinned plates. Place them in a slow oven. 
When they have been in an hour, put them 
into a very hot oven for twenty minute?. 
Rjtsp them as soon as they are baked. 

BREAD FRITTERS. Boil half a pint 
of milk till reduced to half, with a little 
sugar, salt, half a spoonful of orange-flower 
w.iter, and a little lemon-peel shred fine; 
have ready some pieces of crumb of bread, 
cut about the size of half-crowns, but thicker; 
put tin-in into ilu- milk to soak a little, then 
drain, flour, and fry them. Glaze them with 
sugar, and pass the salamander over them. 

BREAD, LONDON. To make London 
bread, put a bushel of good flour which has 
been ground a mondi or six weeks, in one 
end of the trough, and make a hole in the 
middle i.f it. Take nine quarts of warm 
wiiter, and mix it with one quart of good 
yeast; put it into tin; flour, and stir it well 
with your hands; let it remain until it rises 
as high as it will go, which will take about 
an hour and a quarter. Watch it carefully 
to its ultimate height, and do not suffer it to

fall; then make up the dough with eight 
quart.- more of warm water and one pound 
of salt; work it well with vour hands, and 
then cover it over with a sack or other coarse 
cloth. Put the fire into the oven; heat it 
thoroughly, and by the time it is hot, the 
dougli \\iil Ix; ready. Next make the dough 
into loaves, not exceeding four or five pounds 
each, sweep out the oven clean, and put in 
the loaves. Shut the oven close, and they 
will be baked in about two hours anda half; 
then <>|K'ii llie oven, and draw the bread. In 
summer the water need not be more than 
blood warm, but in winter it must be a few 
degrees higher in heat. During a hard 
frost, however, the water should be as hot as 
the hand could bear it, though not sufficiently- 
hot to .scald the yeast, as that would spoil 
the whole batch of bread. Oilier quantities 
of bread are made in the same proportion. 

BREAD, PLAIN SHORT. The same 
proportions of flour and butter must be used 
as in the receipt for short bread ; tin's must 
be mixed together, rolled out, but not made 
quite so thick as in the rich kind; but in the 
same form, pricked with a fork, and pinch- 
ed all round. A little sugar may be added. 

BREAD, RICE. Take a pound of rice, 
and let it simmer in two quarts of water till 
it is quite tender; when it is of a proper 
warmth mix it thoroughly with four pounds 
of flour, adding yeast and salt, the same as 
for other bread ; the proper quantity of yeast 
to be used, is about four spoonfuls; knead it 
well ; then set it to rise before the fire. A 
portion of the flour should be reserved to 
make up the loaves. If the rice should re- 
quire more water, it must be added, as some 
rice swells more than other. 

BREAD, SPICED, COMMON. (1) 
Boil .three pounds of honey in a gallon of 
water fdr a quarter of an hour; then pour it 
on the flour in the trough ; mix them together 
well, until the flour will imbibe no more li- 
quid; when a little cooled, add three ounces 
of potash, infused the night before in half a 
pint of milk, knead the whole well, putting 
to it some pounded anise. Roll out the 
paste, and with paste-cutters of various forms, 
cut it into little figures, lay them on a well- 
oiled tin, and bake them; when done, wash 
them over with milk. With this paste 
spiced nuts are made ; when formed, lay them 
on tins, and leave jn a warm place for two 
or three days before they are baked. 

BREAD, SPICED, (2) FLEMISH. 

The evening before you wish to make 
your spiced bread, dissolve three ounces of 
white potash in halt' a pint of milk, and set 
it aside. The next morning put a consider- 



able quantity of sifted flour into a trough, 
make a hole in the heap, into which pour six 
pounds of clarified honey ; whilst lx>iling,stir 
it well with a strong spatula, until the honey, 
reduced to a firm paste, will imbibe no more 
j flour, then spread it all over the bottom of 
the trough, and leave it for alxnit ten or fif- 
leen minutes; a! the end of that time, i r the 
paste be sufficiently cool for you tolx-ar your 
hand on it, rub its surface with the infusion 
of]X)tash; then let a strong ix.Tson knead it, 
in the same manner as the bakers knead 
bread. Have readv a number of different- 
sized moulds of |iear tree wood, on which 
are cut (pretty deep) octagons of various di- 
mensions; then cut your paste into as many 
pieces as you have moulds, in the following 
proportions: for the mould containing a 
pound, take eighteen ounces of paste ; for a 
half pound, fourteen ounces; a quarter of 
a pound seven ounces of paste, and so on ; 
knead each piece separately on the slab, rub 
them with flour to prevent their adhering, and 
then put them into the respective moulds; 
press it down tight; in a minute or two turn 
them over, place them on a tin plate (pre- 
viously rubbed with olive oil), and with a 
soft brush take off what flour, may remain 
on the surface of die spiced bread, and bake 
them in a moderate oven. Whilst they are 
baking, dissolve some isinglass in a sufficient 
quantity of beer, with which, by means of 
a hair pencil, wash the outside of the spiced 
bread as soon as it is done; and then, while 
it is moist and warm, decorate it with 
blanched almonds, candied lemon and orange 
peel, cut into dice. You may, if you think 
proper, cut these sort of sweet meats into 
very small pieces, and knead them into your 
paste at first. When they are nearly cold, 
separate the pieces with a knife. 

BREAD, SHORT. For two poundsof 
sifted flour allow one pound of butter, salt or 
fresh ; a quarter of a pound of candied orange 
and lemon peel, of pounded loaf sugar, 
blanched sweet almonds, and carraway com- 
fits, a quarter of a pound each ; cut the lem- 
on, the orange peel, and almonds into small 
thin bits, and mix them with a pound and a 
half of the flour, a few of the caraway com- 
fits, and the sugar; melt die butter, and when 
cool, pour it clear from the sediment into the 
flour, at the same time mixing it quickly. 
With the hands, form it into a large round 
of nearly an inch thick, using the remainder 
of the flour to make it up with ; cut it in- 
to four, and with the finger and thumb pinch 
each bit neatly all round the edge ; prick them 
with a fork, and strew the rest of the carra- 
way comfits over the top. Put the pieces 
upon white paper dusted with flour, and 
then upon tins. Bake them in a moderate 
oven.

BREAD, TIPSY. Pare off the cnist, 
and cut into thin round slices of four or five 
inches, the crumb of a Uvo|>enny or three- 
penny roll; spread over eacli bit raspberry 
or strawlxTry jam, and place die slices one 
over the other pretty high in :i glass dish, 
and pour over them as miichshcm, .-weelen- 
ed with sugar, as the bread will soak in; 
stick round llic side-:, and over the top, 
blanched sweet almonds, cut like straws, and 
pour a custard round it. It may IN; made 
the day before, or two or three hours la-lore 
dinner, and with tlie crumb of loaf bread. 

BREAD SAUCE. See SCMCU. 

BRENTFORD ROLLS. Mix widi 
two pounds of flour a little silt, two ounces 
of sifted sugar, four ounces of butter, and 
two eggs beaten with two spoonfuls of yeast, 
and about a pint of milk ; knead the dough 
well, and set it to rise liefore the fire. Make 
twelve rolls, butter tin plates, and set them 
before the fire again to rise. When of a 
proper size, bake them for half an hour. 

BRIOCHE. Divide half a quartern of 
flour into three parts, and knead into one of 
them half an ounce of yeast and a little warm 
water, wrap it in a cloth and set it by, in 
summer time for a quarter of an hour, and 
in winter tor u whole hour. Wlien it has 
risen, put it to the remainder of the flour, 
with a pound and a half of butter, ten eggs, 
half a glass of water, and nearly an ounce 
of salt ; knead them together with your hand 
thoroughly, and then wrap it in a clean nap- 
kin and leave it nine or ten hours. Cut 
the paste into the size you wish to make the 
cakes, moisten, and roll diem in the hand, 
flatten the top, and gild diem with the 
yolk of an egg. Half an hour will be 
sufficient to bake the small ones; large 
cakes will require an hour and a half. 

BROILING. See directions at begin- 
ning of the book. 

BROCCOLI. Set a pan of clean cold 
water on the table, and a saucepan on the 
fire with plenty of water, and a handful of 
salt in it. Broccoli is prepared by stripping 
off all the side shoots, leaving the top; peel 
off the skin of the stalk H itli a knife; cut it 
close off at die bottom, and put it into the 
pan of cold water. When tlie water in the 
yiewjkui boils, and die broccoli is ready, 
put it in; let il boil In i-Uy till the stalks 

feel t lei, from leu to twenty minutes; take 

it up with a slice, that you may not break it; 
let it drain, and serve up. If some of the 
heads of broccoli are much bitter than tlie 
others, put them on to boil first, so that they 
may get ail done together. 06*. It makes 



a nice supper-dish served upon a toast, like 
asparagus. It is a very delicate vegetable, 
and \MI must take it up the moment it is 
done, and send it to table hot. 

BROTH, BARLEY. Chop a leg of 

beef in pieces, boil it in three gallons of 
water, with a carrot and a crn.-t of bread, 
till reduced to half; then strain it oft" and 
put it into the pot again with half a pound 
of barley, (bur or five heads of celery cut 
small, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, a 
little chopped parsley, and a few marigolds. 
Let it boil an hour. Take an old cock or 
large fowl and put it into the pot, boil till 
the broth is quite good. Season with salt, 
take out the onion and herbs, and serve it. 
The fowl may be omitted. 

BROTH, OF BEEF. Wash a leg or 
shin of beef very clean, crack die bone in 
two or three places, add to it any trim- 
mings you have of meat, game, or poultry 
(beads, necks, gizzards or feet) and cover 
them with cold water. Watch and stir it 
up well from die bottom, and die moment it 
begins to simmer, skim it carefully. Your 
brodi must be perfecdy clear and limpid 
for on this depends die goodness of the 
soups, sauces, and gravies, of which it is 
die basis. Then add some cold water to 
make die remaining scum rise, and skim 
it again. When die scum has done rising, 
and die surface of die brodi is quite clear, 
put in one carrot, a head of celery, two 
turnips, and two onions. It should not 
have any taste of sweet herbs, spice or gar- 
lic; either of these flavors may be added 
afterward, if desired. Cover it close, set it 
by die side of die fire, and let it simmer 
very gently, so as not to waste die brodi, 
for four or five hours or more, according to 
die weight of die meat. Strain it dirough 
a sieve into a clean and dry stone pan, and 
set it in the coldest place you have. 

dF* This is die foundation of all sorts 
of soups and sauces, brown and white. 

BROTH, CHICKEN. Take the re- 
maining parts of a chicken from which 
panada has been made, all but die rump; 
skin, and put them into die water it was' 
first boiled in, widi die addition of a little 
mace, onion, and a few pepper-corns, and 
simmer it. When of a good flavor, put to 
it a quarter of an ounce of sweet almonds 
beaten with a spoonful of water; boil it 
a little while, and when cold, take off die 
fat. 

BROTH, CHICKEN PECTORAL. 

Prepare a chicken in the usual way, and 
put it into a saucepan with two pints and a 
half of wnler, two ouncp of pearl barley,

the same of rice, and two ounces of the best 
honey; boil all together, skimming well for 
three hours, until it be reduced to two-thirds. 

BROTH, JELLY. Take a joint of mut- 
ton, a capon, a fillet of veal, and three quarts 
of water ; put these into an earthen pan, and 
boil them over a gentle fire till reduced to 
half; then squeeze all together, and strain 
the liquor through a napkin. 

BROTH, MUTTON. Take two pounds 
of scrag of mutton; to take the blood out, 
put it into a stewpan, and cover it with 
cold water; when the water becomes milk- 
warm, pour it off; then put it in four or five 
pints of water, with a tea-spoonful of salt, a 
table-spoonful of best grits, and an onion ; set 
it on a slow fire, and when you have taken 
all the scum off, put in two or three turnips ; 
let it simmer very slowly for two hours, and 
strain it through a clean sieve. 

BROTH, MUTTON, FOR THE SICK. 
Have a pound and a half of a neck or loin 
of mutton ; take off the skin and the fat, and 
put it into a saucepan ; cover it with cold 
water, (it will take about a quart to a pound 
of meat), let it simmer very gently, and 
skim it well ; cover it up, and set it over a 
moderate fire, where it may stand gently 
stewing for about an hour ; then strain it off. 
It should be allowed to become cold, when 
all the greasy particles will float'on the sur- 
face, and becoming hard, can..jbe easily 
taken off, and the settlings wilF?emain at 
the bottom. N. B. We direct the meat to 
be done no more than just sufficiently to be 
eaten ; so a sick man may have ple'nty of 
good broth for nothing; as by this manner 
of producing it, the meat furnishes also a 
good family meal. This is an inoffensive 
nourishment for sick persons, and the only 
mutton broth that should be given to conva- 
lescents, whose constitutions require replen- 
ishing with restorative aliment of easy di- 
gestion. The common way of making it 
with roots, onions, sweet herbs, &c. &c. is 
too strong for weak stomachs. Plain broth 
will agree with a delicate stomach, when 
the least addition of other ingredients would 
immediately offend it. 

BROTH, MEAGRE, OR SOUP WITH 
HERBS. Set on a kettle of water, put in 
two or three crusts of bread, and all sorts of 
good herbs ; season with salt ; put in butter, 
and a bunch of sweet herbs ; boil it for an 
hour and a half: then strain it through a 
sieve, or napkin. This will serve to make 
lettuce soup, asparagus soup, soup de aante, 
&c. with herbs. 

BROTH, MULLAGATAWNY, OR 



CURRY. Make about two quarts of strong 
veal broth, seasoned with two onions, a 
bunch of parsley, salt and pepper ; strain it, 
and have ready a chicken, cut in joints and 
skinned; put it into the broth, with a table- 
spoonful of currv -powder ; boil the chicken 
till quite tender, and a little l>efore serving, 
add the juice of a lemon, and stir in a tea- 
cupful of cream. Serve boiled rice to eat 
\vith this broth. 

BROTH, RICE VEAL. Wash clean 
six pounds of a knuckle of veal, and cut it 
in two, put it in a saucepan with four quarts 
of boiling water, half a pound of rice well 
washed, a little mace, white pepper, and 
salt, and a handful of chopped parsley; let 
it boil for two hours. Serve part of the 
meat in the tureen with the broth. The 
thick part of the knuckle may be sent up 
as a separate dish, with parsley and butter 
poured over it. 

BRpTH, WHITE. Boil a fowl, and 
when it is enough, take it up, and put it into 
a dish ; then boil your cream with a blade of 
mace, and thicken it with eggs ; then put in 
the marrow of one lieef bone, and take some 
of the broth, and mingle them togetlier ; put to 
it a spoonful of white wine, and let it thick- 
en on the fire ; then put the fowl hot out of 
the broth, set it on a chafing-dish of coals, 
and serve it. 

BROWN ROUX, OR THICKENING. 

Put into a nicely tinned saucepan alwut a 
pound of fresh butter, melt it slowly, and 
dredge in flour till it becomes like a paste, 
carefully stirring it all the time, put it for 
a ffw minutes ii]xin a quick fire, and then 
return it to where there is less heat, and 
stir it till it assumes a light brown color, 
when it may be put into a jar. These 
thickenings keep for sometime. 

BROWNING, Is a convenient article 
to color those soups or sauces of which it is 
supposed their deep brown complexion de- 
notes the strength and savo'.iriness of the 
composition. Burned sugar is also a fa- 
vorite ingredient with the brewers, who use 
it under the name of " essontia bina" to col- 
or tlieir beer : it is also employed by the bran- 
dy makers, in considerable quantity, to color 
brandy; to which, besides enriching its com- 
plexion, it gives that sweetish taste, and ful- 
ness in the mouth, which custom has taught 
brandy drinkers to admire, and prefer to 
the finest Cognac in its genuine state. When 
employed for culinary purposes, this is some- 
times made with strong gravy, or walnut 
catchup. Those who like a gout of acid 
may add a little walnut pickle. Put half 
a pound of pounded lump sugar, and. a table*

used as sauce for boiled fish or poached 
eggs. 

BURNET VINEGAR. See Vinegar. 
BUTTER BISCUITS. See Biscuits. 
BUTTER CAKES. See Cakes. 

BUTTER, CLARIFIED. Put the butter 
in a nice, clean stewpan, over a very clear, 
slow lire; watch it, and when it is melted, 
carefully skim off the buttermilk, &c. which 
will swim on the top; let it stand a minute 
or two for the impurities to sink to the bot- 
tom; then pour the clear butter through a 
sieve into a clean basin, leaving the sediment 
at the bottom of the stewpan. Obs. But- 
ter thus purified will be as sweet as marrow, 
a very useful covering for otted meats, &c. 
and for frying fish equal to the finest Florence 
oil; for which purpose it is commonly used 
by Catholics, and those whose reli<(iniis ten- 
ets will not allow them to eat viands fried in 
animal oil. 

BUTTER, FRENCH MELTED. Mix, 

in a stewpan, with a quarter of a |xnmd of 
fresh bulter, a table-s|x>oi>ful of Hour, a little 
salt, half a gill of water, lialf a spoonful c.f 



white vinegar, and a little grated nutmeg. 
Put it on the fire, stir it, and let it thicken, 
but do not allow it to boil, lest it should taste 
of tlie flour. 

BUTTER, MELTED. (1) Dust a little 
flour over a quarter of a pound of butter, put 
it into a saucepan, with about a wine-glass 
of water ; stir it one way constantly till it be 
melted, and let it just boil: a round wooden 
stick, is the best thing to stir butter with in 
melting. If the butter is to l)e melted with 
cream, use the same proportion as of water, 
but no flour j stir it constantly, and heat it 
thoroughly, but do not let it boil. To oil 
butter, cut about a quarter of a pound into 
slices, put it into a small jar, and place it in 
a pan of boiling water. When oiled, pour 
it off clear from the sediment. 

BUTTER, MELTED, (2) Is so simple 
and easv to prepare, that it is a matter of 
general surprise, that what is done so often, 
is so seldom done right. It is spoiled nine 
times out of ten, more from idleness than from 
ignorance, and rather because the cook won't 
than because she can't do it; which can on- 
ly be the case when housekeepers will not 
allow butter to do it with. Good melted 
butter cannot be made with mere flour and 
water ; there must be a full and proper pro- 
portion of butter. As it must be always on 
the table, and is the foundation of almost all 
our sauces, we have, 

Melted butter and oysters, 

parsley, 

-^ ^ anchovies, 



shrimps, 

lobsters, 

capers, &c. &c. &c. 

I have tried every way of making it; and I 
trust, that I have written a receipt, (3) 
which, if the cook will carefully observe, 
she will constantly succeed in ifivinij satis- 
faclion. In the quantities of the various 
sauces I have ordered. 1 have had in view 
the providing for a family of half a dozen 
moderate people. Never [xmrsance o\er meat 
or even put it into the di.-h; however well 
made, some of the companx may have an 
antipathy to it; tas'.cs iin- as dillerent as 
fiiees: moreover, if it is sent up separate in a 
boat, it will keep hot longer, iiiid what is left 
may be put by for another time, or used for 
another purpo.-c. 

BUTTER, MELTED. (3) Keep a pint 
stew pan; (in- this purpose only. Cut two 
ounces of bulter into little bir^-, that it may 
mi-It more easily, and mix uii-iv readiK ; put 
it into the sk'wpan with a lai ,'; tea-spoon- 
ful (t. e. alxnit three drachms) of flour, 
(some ['refer arrow-root, or potato starch)

and two table-spoonfuls of milk. When 
thoroughly mixed, add six table-spoonfuls 
of water; hold it over the fire, and shake it 
round every minute (all the while the same 
way), till it just Ix-s^ins to simmer; then let 
it stand quietly and boil up. It should ) of 
the thickness of good cream. N. B. Two 
table-spoonfuls of mushroom catchup, instead 
of the milk, will make as good mushroom 
sauce as need be, and is a sii|x-rlativc accom- 
jKiiiinu-nt to either fish, tle.-h, or fowl. 
Obi. This is the best way of preparing 
melted butter; milk mixes with the butter 
much more easily and more int mutely than 
water alone can be made to do. This is 
of proper thickness to be mixed at table 
with flavouring essences, anchovy, mush- 
room, or cavice, &c. If in: li- i.ic.cly t.i

to it. X. 1$. If the butter oils, put a

tance from th<- lire, so that it may melt grad- 
ually, till it comes to an oil; and pour it od

supply the place of olive oil ; and by some is 
preferred to it either for salads or frying.

CAKES. PREPARATORY REMARKS. 

The currants and raisins should be prepared 
as directed under the article headed, Pud- 
dings and I'i-s, and tlie flour dried before 
the fire on a large sheet of white paper, then 
sifted and weighed. Almonds should be 
blanched by pouring hot water over them, 
and, after standing some minutes, taking off 
th. 1 .-kin, then throwing them into rose or 
c >ld xvat.T. When not pounded, they should 
be. cut lengthwise into thin bits. Sugar 
should be roughly pounded, rolled with a 
bottle ii|n white paper,and then sifted. All 
spices, after beinj well dried at tlie fire, should 
li.- finely (xiunded and sifted. Lemon and 
orange-|>eel must be pared very thin, and 
pounded with a little sugar. The butter, 
after being weighed, should be laid into cold 
water, or washed in rose water, and if salt, 
be well washed in several waters. The 
yolks and whites, of eggs should lie separately 
and long beaten, then strained; two whisks 
should be kept exclusively for that pur- 
pose, as tlie whites especially require to be 
managed with tlie greatest care. A horn 
spoon should be used for mixing those cakes 
which are not directed to be beaten with the 
hand. To make cakes light, salvolatile, or 
smelling salts, may be added immediately 
before putting them into the oven, allowing, 
to a sponge cake, made of one pound of flour, 
one tca-epoonfnl ; and two or three to a large 
plum cake. Cheese cakes, queen cakes, 
sponge biscuits, and small sponge cakes, re- 
quire a quick oven till they have risen ; after- 
wards tlie beat should be more moderate. 
Plum, seed cakes, and all large kinds, must be 
well soaked, and therefore do not require a 
brisk oven. To preserve their color, a sheet of 
white piper is put over them, and after they 
have risen and become firm, they are turned 
round. To ascertain if a large cake be 
sufficiently done, a broad bladed knife is 
plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and 
clean when drawn out, file cake is baked; 
1 jut if anything adheres to tlie blade, it must 
in -taut ly lie returned to the oven, and the 
door closed. When the oven is too hot, it 
is better to lessen tlie fire than to open the 
door. 

C VK*K. Take two pounds and a half of 
dried and sifted flour, tlie same of well clean- 
ed and dried currants, two |xmnds of fresh 
butter, two of finely -|x>unded and silted loaf

pounded cinnamon, one ounce of citron and

CM'ONS OR FOWLS, Must be kill- 
ed a coaple of days in moderate, and more 
in col. I wiMlh'T, before they are dressed, or 
tli v will eat tonsil: a good criterion of the 
ripeness of p-uiltry f"r the spit, is the ease 
with which you can then pull out the feathers ; 
when a fowl is plucked, leave a few to help 
you to ascertain this. They are managed 
exact l\ in tin- same manner, ami sent up 
with tin- same Alices as a turkey, niiK they 
require proportionabU 1. -- time at the fire. 
A full-growl live-toed fowl, alniut an hour 
and a quarter. A noderate-Maod one, an 
hour A chicken, from thirty to foru min- 
Here, also, |rk sausages I'ried are 
in general a favorite accoiii] aniiuctit, or 
turkey sliiltin^: sir forcemeats; put in plen- 
ty of it, so as to plump out the lowl, which 



mu>t be tied closely (t*>th at the neck and 
rump), to keep in the stuffing. Some cooks 
put the li\er of ill;- fowl into this forcemeat, 
and others mince it and (Kiunil it, and nib it 
up with flour and melted butter. When 
the bird is stuffed and trussed, score the 
gizzard nicely, dip it into melted butter, let 
il drain, and then season it with < 
and salt; put it under one pinion, and the 
liver under the other; to prevent their get- 
ting hardened or scorched, cover them with 
double paper twittered. Take care that 
your roasted poultry l>e well browned ; it is 
as indispensable that roasted poultry should 
have a rich brown complexion, ai boiled 
poultry should have a delicate white one. 

CAPON, TO CHOOSE. If it is young, 
his spurs arc short and his legs smooth ; if 
a true capon, a fat vein on the side of his 
breast, the comb pale, and a thick Ix-lly and 
rump; if fresh, he will have a close hard 
vent ; if stale, a loose open vent. 

CAPON, THE FRENCH WAY. Take 
a quart of white wine, season the capon 
with salt, cloves, and whole pepper, a few 
shallots ; and then put the capon in an earth- 
en pan ; you must take care it has not room 
to shake ; it must be covered close, and done 
over a slow charcoal fire. 

CAPON PASTY. Roast a capon, let 
it be cold, take the flesh from the bones and 
slice it, but keep the thighs and pinions 
whole. Add to the flesh of the capon, four 
sweetbreads and half a pint of oysters, sea- 
son them with salt, cloves, nutmeg, and 
mace, sweet marjoram, pennyroyal, and 
thyme, minced ; lay a sheet of paper or 
paste in \our pasty-pan, and lay the thighs 
and pinions on the Ixittom, and strew them 
over with sliced onions, then put in the 
flesh of the capon, the sweetbreads, and die 
oysters, cut in halves ; over these strew a 
handful of chestnuts, boiled and blanclied, 
then put butter over them, close up your pan 
and bake it ; when done, add gravy, good 
stock, draw n butter, anchovies, and" grated 
nninie,'; '.furnish with slices of lemon, and 
serve. Turkey may be done in the same 
manner. 

CAPONS A LA TURQUE. I'ick, 

and clean very nicely, two tine cajHiiis : wash 
the inside |x-rfectlv clean with warm water, 
and let them soak in warm water for a 
quarter of an hour; dry them well, and put

which was prepared for the stuffing, and 
pour over the fowls a veloute sauce. One 
fine large fowl may be dressed in this 
manner. 

CAPSICUMS, TO PICKLE. Gather 
the pods, witli the stalks on, before they turn 
red; cut a slit down the side with a pen- 
knife, and take out all the seeds, but as lit- 
tle of the meat as possible; lay them in a 
strong brine for three days, changing it eve- 
ry day ; then take them out, lay them on a 
cloth, and lay another over them till they 
are quite dry ; boil vinegar enough to cover 
them, put in some mace and nutmeg beat 
small; put the pods into a glass>or jar, and 
when the liquor is cold, pour it over, then 
tie a bladder and leather over them. 

CARDOONS, WITH CHEESE. String 
and cut them an inch long, put them into a 
saucepan with red wine, seasoned with pep- 
per and salt, stew them till they are tender, 
put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, and 
when of a proper thickness pour them into 
a dish, squeeze the juice of an orange into 
the sauce, and scrajx; over them some Par- 
mesan or Cheshire cheese, and then brown 
them with a cheese-iron, but not of too high 
a color. 

CARDOONS, TO DRESS. Cut them 
in pieces six inches lung, and put them on a 
string ; boil till tender, have ready a piece 
of butter in a pan, (lour and fry them. They 
may also be tied in bundles, and served as 
asparagus boiled on a toast, and pour but- 
ter over. 

CARDOONS, SPANISH. Cut them 
into lengdis of three inches, be careful not 
to use those which are hollow and green; 
boil tlic-in for half an hour, then put them 
into lukewarm writer to cleanse them from 
their slime; then dress them in some stock, 
with a spoo.iful of flour, some salt, onions, 
roots, a bunrh of sueet herbs, a little ver- 
juice, and a little butter; when done, put 
them into a cullis with sonic stock; cook 
them for an hour in this sauce, and serve. 

CARROTS. Let them be well washed 
and brushed, not scraped. An hour is 
enough for young spring carrots ; grown car- 
rots must be cut in half, and will take from 
an hour and a hall" to two hours and a half. 
When done, rub off the peels with a clean 
coarse cloth, and slice them in two or four, 
.-according to their size. The best way to 
try if they are done enough, is to pierce them 
with a fork. Many |x?t>ple are fond of cold 
carrot with cold beef; ask if you shall cook 
enough for some to Ix; left to send up v\ ith 
the cold meat. 



CARAMEL, OR BOILED SUGAR. 

Break into a small copper or brass pan, one 
pound of refined sugar, put in a gill of 
spring water ; set if on a fire, and when 
it boils, skim it quite clean, and let it boil 
quick, till it comes to the degree called 
Crack, which may be known by dipping a 
teaspoon or skew er into the sugar, and let 
it drop to the bottom of a pan of cold water; 
and if it remains hard, it has attained that 
decree; squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, 
and let it remain one minute longer on the 
fire, then set the pan into anotlier of cold 
water: have ready moulds of any shape, 

rub them over with sweet oil, dip a spoon 
or (I irk into the sugar, and throw it over the 
mould in line threads, till it is quite covered: 

nfRke a small handle of caramel, or stick

with the roe fried, cut lemon and parsley. 

CARP, STEWED. Scale and clean 
a brace of carp, reserving the liver and 
roe; pour over the fish in a deep pan a pint 
of vinegar, which may IK- elder vinegar, if

two onions sliced, a faggot of parsley, basil, 
thyme, and marjoram: let them soak an 
hour, then put them in a stewpan with the 
vinegar, and otln-r things, the liver chopped, 
a pint of .Madeira, and three pints of veal 
stock ; steu them an hour or two accord- 
ing to their siae; takeout the fish and put 
them over a |>an of hot water to keep warm 
while the following sauce is made: Strain 
the liquor, and add the yolks of three eggs 
beaten, half a pint of cream, a large spoon- 
ful of flour, and a quarter of a pound of 
butter, stir it constantly, and just before 
putting it over the carp, squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon, lioil or fry the roe.

pint and a half of flour; lay it on the board, 
make a hole in die middle, into which put 
three quarters of a pound of butter, and work 
it in well ; add to it a litde Gruyere cheese 



grated, and six eggs. Knead these all to- 
gether well ; mould it up, and let it stand 
for half an hour ; then roll it out, and make 
it into a cake of about three inches; mark 
it widi a knife on one side in chequers, and 
on die odier in rays ; dcr~ez, and bake it in 
a moderate oven. 

CHEESE CREAM. Warm three hall 
pints of cream with one half pint of milk, 
or according to die same proportion, and 
put a little rennet to it ; keep it covered in 
a warm place till it is curdled; have a pro- 
per mould with holes, either of China or any 
other; put the curds into it to drain, about 
an hour, or less : serve widi a good plain 
cream, and pounded sugar over it. 

CHEESECAKES. (1) Put two quarts 
of new milk into a stowpan, set it near the 
fire, and stir in two table-spoonfuls of ren- 
net: let it stand till it is set (this will take 
alxwt an hour) ; break it well widi your 
hand, ajd let it'remain half an hour longer; 
then poVyftjff thje whey^and put die curd into 
a lokyider-to, drain ; '.vjjLien quite dry, put it 
in a mortar', aml^wmjuBk quite, .smooth;

your tins ready lined with puft' paste about 
a quarter of an inch thick, notch diem all

Bake them twenty minutes. When you 
have company, and want a variety, you can 
make a mould of curd and cream, by put- 
ting die curd in a mould full of holes, instead 
of the colander: let it stand for six hours, 
dien turn it out very carefully on a dish, and 
pour over it half a pint of good cream sweet-

use tin patties lo bake in, butter them, or 
you will not be able to take them out; but 
if you bake them in glass or china, only an 
upper crust will be necessary, as you will 
not want to take them out when you send 
them to table. 

CHEESECAKES. (*} Take one pound 
of loaf sugar jxiundcd, six yolks, and four 
whites of eggs beaten, the juice of three fine 
lemon-, the united rind of two, and a quar-

of good mellow cheese into thin bits; add 
to it two, and if the cheese is dry, three 
ounces of fresh butter; (xmnd, and rub them 
well together in a mortar till it is quite 
smooth. When cheese is dry, and for those 
whom digestion is feeble, this is the best 
way of eating it; and spread on bread, it 
makes an excellent luncheon or siipjier. 
Tin- pir/uance of this is sometime- inm-as- 
cd by |>!iiidii>!( with it curry powder, ground 
spire, black |x-p|x-r, ('avenue, and a little

put them into a Dutch oven covered with a 
dish, till hot through, n-ni' \e the di.-h, and 
let tin- cheese brown a little. Se.

Clll. I AKH. M.-lt three- 

quarters of an ounce of butler in a tea-cup- 
am, mix with it a quarter of a 



pound of good clieese finely grated, beat it 
well together ; put a slice of toasted bread 
into a dish, and pour the mixture over it, 
and brown it with a salamander. 

CHEESE TOASTED, OR RABBIT. 

Cut a slice of bread, toast it, and soak it 
in red wine, put it before the fire; cut some 
cheese in very thin slices, and nib some but- 
ter over tin- 1 >! torn of a plate, lay the cheese 
upon it, and pour in two or three spoonfuls 
of white wine, and a little mustard; cover 
it with another plate, and set it on a chafing- 
dish ot "coals two or three minutes, then stir 
it till it is well mixed ; when it is mixed 
enough, lay it upon die bread, and brown it 
with a salamander. 

CHEESE TOASTED. Cut a slice of 
bread alx >nt half an inch thick ; pare off die 
crust, and toast it very slightly on one side 
so as just to brown it, without making it 
hard or burning it. Cut a slice of good 
fat mellow cheese, a quarter of an inch 
thick, not so big as the bread by half an 
inch -in each aide: pare off the rind, cut out 
all the species and rotten parts, and lay it 
on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; 
carefully \\atch it tliat it does not bum, and 
stir it \\ith a spoon to prevent a pellicle 
lorming on the surface. Have ready good 
mustard, pepper and salt. If you observe 
the directions here given, the cheese will 
eat mellow, and will be uniformly done, 
and the bread crisp and soft, and will well 
deserve its ancient appellation of a " rare 
bit." This Receipt, as well as every other 
worth extracting, is from the Cook's Oracle. 
The Editor goes on to say. We have noth- 
ing to add lo the directions given for toa-t- 
ini; the chi-esc iii tlie last receipt, except that 
in sending it up, it will save much time in 
|xirt ioniii^ jt out at table, if you have half a 
dozen small silver or tin pan* to fit into the 
clieese-toaster, and do the clieese in these: 
each person may then be helped to a sepa- 
rate pun, and it will keep the clieese much 
liolter than the usual way of eating it on a 
cold plate. Obs. Ceremony seldom tri- 
umphs more completely o\er comfort than in 
the serving out of this dish; which, to be 
presented to the palate in perfection, it is 
imperainely incli-|-nsal)le tli.it it be intro- 
duced to the mouth as soon as it appears on 

the t.dile.

CHERRY BRANDY. (2) Choose 
fine sound morella cherries, and having 
taken off the stalks, place them in layers 
in glass jars ; strew powder-sugar between 
each layer, and cover them with brandy. 
As soon as the cherries have imbibed the 
brandy, pour in more, so as to keep them 
constantly covered. 

CHERRIES, DRIED. Take large 
cherries, not too ripe ; pick off the stalks, 
and take out the stones with a quill cut 
nearly as for a pen: to three pounds of which 
take three pounds or pints of clarified sugar ; 
boil it to the degree of blown ; put in the 
cherries, give them a boil, and set them by 
in an earthen pan till the next day; then 
strain the sirup, add more sugar, and boil 
it of a good consistence; put the cherries in, 
and boil them five minutes, and set them by 
another day: repeat the boiling two more 
days, and when wanted, drain them some- 
time, and lay them on wire sieves to diy in 
a stove, or nearly cold oven. 

CHERRY PUDDING. See Puddings. 

CHERVIL, Is principally used in soups 
and stuffing, and is generally preserved with 
other herbs as follow s : take of sorrel, chervil, 
beet, purslain, and cucumbers, if in season, 
quantities according to your liking; wash 
them well; mince and press them in your 
hand, to squeeze out all the water. Put 
them into a kettle with water, some butter 
and salt, and boil them until the water is 
entirely consumed. Then take them out, 
and when cold, put them into pots; cover 
them with warmed butter. When you 
want to use these herbs, put them into some 
stock that has very little salt in it. If tliey 
are required for a farce or garnish, boil them 
a minute or two in some butter; thicken 
with the yolks of eggs and milk; when so 
prepared, they may be served under hard 
eggs or broiled fish. For sauce, it must be 
chopped small, boiled in salt and water, and 
mixed with melted butter. 

CHESTNUTS, Should be placed on the 
fire in a pan with holes to roast ; first slitting 
or cutting a notch in the skins, to pi-event 
their flying off. When done, serve them in 
dessert on a napkin, as hot as possible. 
Some boil the chestnuts instead of roasting 
them, as the skins are then cleaner, but the 
nuts not quite so mealy; the better way 
is to boil them in plenty of water, and 
when nearly done, take them out and roast 
them. 

CHICKENS. Having picked the chick- 
ens, singe them well to remove all the hairs, 
'&c., which may remain on the skin; then 



bruise the bone close to the foot, and draw 
the strings from the thigh. Take out the 
crop by a slit cut in the back of the neck; 
then cut off the neck, leaving skin enough Jo 
turn over the back. Cut off the vent, and 
take out the inside, l>eing careful not to break 
the gall ; break the hack-bone and the two 
bones leading to the pinions ; wi)>e the chick- 
en with a cloth, and put in a little pepper 
and salt. If the chicken is to l)e trussed lor 
roasting, proceed as follows: Turn the legs 
close down to the apron and run a skewer 
through ; run another skewer in the joint of 
one wing through the liody to (he other wing ; 
and Inning washed the liver and <ri/,/.ard, 
place them in the pinions. For boiling, the 
under part of the thigh must he cut, and the 
legs placed under the apron, only letting die 
ends be seen. Be sure to preserve the breast 
very full. 

CHICKEN BROTH. See Broth. 

CHICKENS, BROILED OR GRILL- 
ED. Pick and singe them nicely, wash 
them clean, and dry them in a cloth ; cut them 
down the hack, truss the legs and wings, as 
for boiling; flatten them, and put them upon 
a cold gridiron; when they become a little 
dry, put them upon a plate, baste them with 
butter, and strew a little salt and pepper 
over the inside, which part is laid first upon 
the gridiron; baste them frequently, and let 
them broil slowly for alxnit half an hour. 
Serve them very hot, with melted butter 
poured over them, or plenty of stewed mush- 
rooms. The livers and gizzards may be 
broiled with them, fastened into the wings, 
or well seasoned, broiled, and served with 
the chickens.

Ijutcher to cut them of even thickness; if he 
does not, divide the thicker from tlie thinner 
pieces, and give them time accordingly. 

CHOWDER. I,ay some slices cut from 
the fat part of a Ix-llv-piece of pork, in a 
deep stewpan, mix sliced onions with a 
variety of sweet herbs, and lay them on the 
|>ork. Bone and cut a fresh cod into thin 
.-liees, and place them on the pork ; then put 
a layer of pork, on that a layer of biscuit, 
then alternately the other materials until tlie 
pan is' nearly full, season with pepper and 
salt, put in about a pint and a lialf of water, 
lay a paste over the whole, cover tlie stewpan 
very close, and let it stand, with fire above 
as well as below, for four hours; then skim 
it well, and put it in a dish, pour a glass of 
.Madeira made hot over it, also some Jamaica 
pepper, stewed mushrooms, truffles, and 
oysters; brown the paste slightly, and lay it 
over tlie whole. 

CHOWDER FOR TEN OR TWELVE. 

Take of salt |x>rk cut in thin slices, as much 
as will make half a pint of fat, when tried, 
which will do for two good sized cod or 
haddock. Be careful not to burn the fat 
First, put your fat in the pot. Secondly, 
cut your fish in as large pieces as will go 
into the pot ; then put a layer of fish on the 
fat ; pepper, salt and a few cloves, then a 
layer of the slices of pork, strewed over with 
onions cut fine ; then a layer of shiphread 
or hard crackers dipped in water ; then your 
thickening. Go on again with fish, &c. &c. 
as above, till your |xit is nearly full, then put 
in water until you can just see it, an 1 let it 
stew slowly, so as not to break tlie fish. 
After coming to a boil, it will be done in 
twenty-five or thirty minutes. N. B. Some 
like |x>latocs cut in slices, which may l in- 
troduced between each layer. Likewise 
wine or cider, as you fancy. QCJ- This 
Receipt is according to the most approved 
method, practised by fishing parties in Bos- 
ton harbor. 

CHOWDER, CL \ M , May Iw made in 
the same way, substituting a sufficient 
quantity of clams instead of cod, the heads 
or hard leathery |>art being first cat off. 
.Many prefer clam chowder, nicely cooked, 
to chowder made of cod, had. lock. &C. 
The pilgrim! to Plymouth, it is said, could 
cook this shell lisli and lolisters i.. nearly 
fifty dilli-icnt wa\s, anil even as puddings, 
pancakes, &c. 

C1IOUX. Put a pint of water into a 
slew pan, with half a pound of fresh butler, 
the rim!- of twu lemons grated, a quarter 
of a pound of sugar, and a very little salt;

as sxm as the water begins to boil, add as 
much flour as the liquor will imbibe; when 
the paste becomes very thick, keep stirring 
with a spoon until quite done, then let it 
cool. After that, break into it a sufficient 
(after of egg! to make the paste soft ; taking 
rare that it he firm enough to allow you to 
work it up with the hand ; when it may In-

be glazed and garnished either with almonds 
or pistachio nuts; when baking the chour, 
be careful to keep the oven tightly closed. 

CITRON CHEESECAKES. Boil a 
pint of cream, and when cold, mix with it 
two eggs well-beaten ; then boil them togeth- 
er until they become a curd. Beat a feu 
blanched almonds in a mortar, with a little 
orange-flower water; put them to the curd, 
and add some Naples biscuits and green cit- 
ron, chopped very small. Sweeten, and bake 
in tins. 

CITRON PUDDING. See Puddings. 

CLARET PUFFS. Mix together, and 
sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, a pint of 
claret, and rather more than one of rich 
cream; let it stand a night, and then whisk 
it to a froth, which take oft" as it rises, and 
put upon the back of a sieve to drain ; heap 
it upon a dish, sweeten some rich cream, 
and pour it round the froth, to make it float. 

CLOVE, ESSENCE OF. Infuse a 
drachm of oil of cloves in two ounces of

COCHINEAL PREPARED. Pound 
an ounce of cochineal to a very fine powder, 
pound also an ounce of cream of tartar, and 
two drachms of alum; put these ingredients 
into a saucepan with half. a pint of water; 
when it boils take it from the lire, and let 
it cool ; pour it oft' into a bottle, as free from 
sediment as possible, and set it by for use. 

COCOA. Put into a saucepan one ounce 
of good cocoa and one quart of water; cover 
it, and when it boils, set it In the side of the 
fire to simmer for two hours. It is some- 
times made in a larger quantity, poured 



from the sediment, and boiled up as it IB re-

COCOA-NUT SWEETMEAT. (1) 

Cut the nut out of the shell, jvire it carefully, 
and throw it into cold water; then grate it, 
andlxiil it in clarified sugar, (a pound to each 
jxjund of the cocoa-nut; until quite thick; 
stir it frequently to prevent its burning. 
Then pour it on a well buttered dish or mar-

COD. A cod-fish should be firm and 
white, the gills red, and the eye lively; a 
fine fish is \ery thick alxmt the neck; if the 
flesh is at all flabby it is nut good. Cod la 
in its prime during the months of October 
and November, if the weather be cold; from 
the latter end of March to May, cod is also 
very fine. The length of time it requires 
for boiling depends on the si/.e of the fish, 
which varies from one pound to twenty; a 
small fish, about two or three pounds weight 
will Ix? stitlicientlv boiled in a quarter of an 
hour or twenty minutes after the water boils. 
Prepare a cod for dressing in the following 
manner: empty and wash it thoroughly, 
scrape ofTall the scales, cut open the Ix-lK*, 
and wash and dry it well, rub a little salt 
inside, or lay it for an hour in strong brine. 
The simple way of dressing is i>a.~ follows: 
Tic up the head, and put it into a fish-kettle, 
with plenty of water and salt in it ; boil it 
gently, and serve it with oyster sauce. Lay 
a napkin under the fish, and garnish with 
slices of lemon, horse-radish, &c. 



COD BAKED. (1) Soak a fine piece 
of the middle of fresh cod in melted butter, 
with parsley and sweet herbs shred very fine; 
let it stand over the lire lor sometime, and 
then bake it. I*et it be of a good color. 

COD BAKED. (2) Choose a fine large 
cod, clean it well, and open the under part 
to the bone, and put in a stulYing made with 
i i :ii>!cy, .-wi'd hcibs sliced fine', an 
egg, and seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg,

ia to be added a spoonful at a time, and well 
stirred between each ; then boil gently, still 
stirring to prevent the mixture from boiling 
over as the coffee swells, and to force it into 
combination with tile water, this will be ef- 
fected in a few minutes, after which, the 
most gentle boiling must IK- kept up during 
an hour. The coffee must then be i-cmn\ed 
from the fire to settle, one or two spoonfuls 
of cold water thrown in assists the. clarifica- 
tion, and precipitates die grounds. In about 
an hour, or as soon as the liquor has become 
clear, it is to be poured into another vessel, 
taking care not to disturb the sediment. 
Coffee made in this manner will be of the 
finest flavor, and may tie kept three day* 
in summer, and four or five in winter; when 
ordered for use, it only requires heating in 
die coffee-pot, and may be served up at two 
minutes' notice. Coffee should never be 
roasted but at the precise time of its being 
used, and then it should be watched with 
the greatest care, and made of a gold color 
rather than a brown one ; above all, take care 
not to burn it, for a very few grains burnt 
will be sufficient to communicate a bitter 
and rancid taste to several pounds of coffee. 
Jt is the best way to roast it in a roaster, 
(over a charcoal fire), which turns with tlie 
hand, as by that means it is not forgot, which 
often is the case when on a spit before die 
fire. 

COFFEE, FRENCH METHOD OF 
PREPARING. 1st. Let your coffee be dry, 
not in the least mouldy or damaged. 2d. 
Divide the quantity lhat is to be roasted into 
two parts. 3d. Roast the first part in a 
coder- roaster, the handle of which must be 
kept constantly turning until the coffee be- 
comes tile color of dried almonds or bread - 
raspings, and has lost one eighth of its 
weight. llh. I toast the second |>art until 
it assumes the fine br\\n color of clu.-tniits, 
and has lost OIK- tilth of its \\cight. 5th. 
Mix the two parts together, and grind them 
in a coffee mill. 6th. Do not roast or make 
your collee until the day it is u anted. 7th. 
To two ounces of ground coffee, jwit four 
cups of cold water. Draw off this infusion, 
and put it aside. Sth. Put to tlie coffee 
which remains in the biggin, three cups of 
lioilini: water, (hen drain it oil' and add this 
inl'n.-i'/'i to that which has Ix-cii put aside. 
By thi.- method you obtain three cups more. 
When your coffee is wanted, In-at it (|iiickly 
in a silver coffee-pot, taking care not to let 
it boil, that tlie perfume may not U.- lost by 
undergoing any evaporation. Then pour it 
into cu|M, which each person may sweeten 
according to his taste. Particular care 
shoulil be taken not to make roflit- in a tin 
vessel; it should be made either in a China 
vessel, or one of Delft ware, or in one of

silver. For a long time, the tin bigjins, in- 
vented by .Monsieur de Belloy, were made 
use of; but some person has since improved 
upon Ins plan, by making them of silver or 
porcelain, which are found to lie much tetter. 

COFFEE CREAM. (1) Mix three 
cups of good coffee with one pint of cream, 
and sugar according to taste; boil them to- 
gether, and reduce them about one-third ; 
observe that the codec must be done as- if it 
was for drinking alone, and settled very clear, 
before you mix it with the cream. 

COFFEE CREAM. (2) Boil a calf's 
foot in water till it wastes to a pint of jellv; 
clear oil' the sediment ami lilt. .Make a tea- 
cup of eery strong coffee; clear it with a 
bit of isinglass, to Ix: perfectly bright; pour 
it to the jellv, and add a pint of very good 
cream, and as much fine Lislxi'i sugar as is 
pleasant; give one boil up, and pour into 
tile dish. It should jelly, but not l;e still'. 
Observe that your coffee be fresh. 

COLLOPS. Cut some veal cutlets; fry

1 iling it with a Ix-ater till of a nL-e 

brown color. Have ready some highly-sea- 
soned !>(!' gravy, which, with the minced 
c::!l'>]'s, put into a saucepan, and let it stew 
half a\> h -nr ; and just l>eforc serving, put a 
titble-sjXKunful of mushroom catchup, and, if 
liked, some green pickles. Beef suet is as 
ofieii used as butter to fry the collops in. 

COLLOPS, RUSSIAN. Break four eggs 
, into a stewpan, and mix with them two 
S]X>onfuls of /lour, then half a glass of good 
Cieam, a spoonful of warm butter, and a 
grain of salt ; when these are well mixed to- 
gether, |H)ur some of it into a large frying-pan, 
and fry it of a light color on both sides; 
then take it out, and fry more in the same 
way, like pancakes, until you have a dozen 
very thin, cut each in half, and trim them 
into oblong pieces all the same size: lay on 
each some quenelle, minced fowl or game, 



as if for croquettes; wrap the fried batter 
round it, wetting the edges, that (hey may 
adhere properly, with a little of the batter, 
having reserved some for the purpose; ihen 
have ready beaten, six eggs and a little salt, 
mask till-in with brcad-<Tiiii]l>s, fry them of a

ras!i;Ts of broiled bacon round them. 

COLD MEAT BROILED, WITH 
POACHED EGGS. The inside of a sirloin 
of Iv;.'/' is best tiir this di^h, or a leg of mut- 
ton. Cut the .-licesof even and equal thick- 
ness, and broil and brown them tarofiilly 
ant! slightly over a clear smart (ire, or in a 
Dutch oven; give those slices most fire that 
are least done; la\ them in a dish Ix-fore the 
(ire to keep hot, while you |x>ach the eggs, 
and mash potatoes. 

COLORING FOR JELLIES, CAKES, 
&c. For a beautiful red. boil fifteen grains 
of cochineal in the (ine.-t powder, with a 
drachm and a half of cream of tartar, in 
half a pint of water very slowly, half an 
hour. Add, in boiling, a bit of alum the 
size of a pea. Or use Ix-ct-root sliced, and 
some liquor poured over. For white, use 
almonds finely powdered with a little drop 
of water ; or us; 1 IT. am. For ycllw-. y .!!- -

ter: when they are dry, flour and fry them 
in fresh butter; let the butter be quite hot 
before you put in the cucumbers ; fry them 
till they are brown, then take them out with 
an egg-slice, and lay them on a sieve to 
drain the fat. from diem (some cooks fry 
sliced onions, or some small button onions, 
with them, till they are a delicate light 
brown color, drain them from the fat, and 
then put them into a stewpan with as much 
gravy as will cover them): stew slowly till 
they are tender; take out the cucumbers 
with a slice, thicken the gravy with flour 
and butter, give it a boil up, season it with 



pepper and salt, and put in the cucumbers; 
as soon as they are warm, they are ready. 
Tlie above, nibt>ed through a tamis, or fine

pan, and leave it by the side of the fire to 
simmer for half an hour longer, that the 
thickening may thoroughly incorporate with 
the gravy, the stewpan being only half cov- 
ered, stirring it every now and then ; a sort 
of scum will gather on the top, which it is 
best not to take off till you are ready to 
strain it through a tamis. Tuke care it is 
neither of too pale nor too dark a color; if 
it is not thick enough, let it stew longer, till 
it is reduced to die desired thickness; or 
add a bit of glaze, or portable soup to it, 
if it is too thick, you can easily diin it with 
a spoonful or two of warm broth, or water 
When your sauce is done, stir it in the ba- 
sin you" put it into once or twice, while it is 
cooling.

stuffing, take an ounce of onion and half an 
ounce of green sage; chop tliein very fine, 
and mix them with two ounces, i. e. about 
a breakfast-cupful, of bread crumbs, a bit 
of butter about as big as a walnut, a very 
little black pepper and salt, and the yolk of 
an egg to bind it; mix these thoroughly to- 
getlier, and put into the duck. From half 
to three-quarters of an hour will lie enough 
t.i rast it, uncording to the size: contrive 
to have the feet delicately crisp, as some 
people are very fond of them ; to do this 
nicely you must have a sharp fire. 

DUCK, TO P.OIL. Make a paste, al- 
lowing half a pound of butter to a pound of 
fl-iur. Truss a duck as for l>oiliiig; put in- 
to the inside a little pcp|x>r and sill, one or 
two sage leaves, and a little onion finely 
minced; enclose the duck in the paste, with 
a little jellied gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and 
serve it with brown gravy poured round it. 

DUCKS, TO CHOOSE. Tlrcir feet 



should be supple, and they should 1* hard 
and thick on the breast and belly. The feet 
of a taine duck are thick, and inclining to a 
dusky \cllo\\. The feet of a wild duck are 
reddi.-h, and smaller than the tame ; they 
should lie picked dry. Ducklings should be 
scalded. 

DUCK, DRESSED IN DIFFER KM' 
\\"A VS. Take either a large duck, or two 
ducklings, which truss like a fowl lor boil- 
ing ; put it into a ]xit (just alxmt lar<Te 
enough to hold the duck) with thin slices of 
Uicon, a little stock, a glass of wine, pepper, 
salt, onions, carrots, a head of celery sliced, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, two cloves, and a 
ba\-leaf ; when done, take out the duck, 
wipe the fat off very clean, and serve with 
what sauce or ragout \ou choose, such as 
sweetbreads, green-peas, turnips, chestnuts, 
olives, cucumbers, or any sort of .-tewed 
greens, according to the season. 

DUCKS, GEESE, DRESSED, OR 
HASHKD. Cut an onion into small dice; 
put it into a stewpan with a bit of butter; 
fry it, but do not let it get any color; put 
as much boiling water into the stewpan as 
will make sauce for the hash; thicken it 
with a little flour; cut up the duck, and put 
it into the sauce to warm; do not let it 
boil; season it with pepper and salt, and 
catchup. Divide the duck into joints; lay 
it by ready; put the trimmings and stuffing 
into a stewpan, with a pint and a half of 
broth or water; let it lil half an hour, and 
then rub it through a sieve; put half -an 
ounce of butter into a stew pan; as it melts, 
mix a table-s|y.unful of flour with it; stir it 
over the fire a few minutes, tlien mix the 
gravy with it by decrees ; as scion as it boils, 
take oft the scum, and strain through a sieve 
into a stewpan; put in the duck, and let it 
stew very gently for ten or fil'i' en minutes, 
if the duck IB rather under-roasted: if there 
is any flit, skim it oil': line the dish you 
serve it up in with sippets of bread either 
fried or toasted. 

DUCK OR GOOSE FORCED. Cut 

the ifin.se o|X'ii at the back, and farefullv 
take out the lx>nes, excepting those of tlie 
legs and wiu^s. Take out all the meat from 
tile l>ody, leaving the skin perfectly whole. 
With tile meat |xHind three-<|uai leis of a 
pound of lean and tender beef, add three 
handfuls of grated bread, f-\\r well-beaten 
e:;gs, and half a pint of rich .-ueet cream; 
season with pepper, mace, and salt; mix it 
all well together; let it Maud for half an 
hour, and then put it into the ii'xise, which 
sew up, and make it of as natural a form as 
|X)ssible; but take care that it Ix; not t<x> 
much stufied. Boil it for half an hour in

water, and having cut your paste into small 
pieces, about an inch square, and having 
floured each, put them into hot but not boil- 
ing water, shake the kettle the instant after 
you have thrown them in, and as they rise. 
if they are firm to the touch, they are suf- 
ficiently done, and must be taken out of the

EELS AND SOLES, STEWED Wio- 
GY'S WAY. Take two pounds of fine sil- 



ver eels: the l>est are those that are rather 
more than a half-crown piece in circumfer- 
ence, quite fresh, full of life, and " as brisk 
AS an eel:" wash them in several different 
waters, and divide them into pieces alwiit 
four inches long. Some cooks, dredge them 
with a little flour, wipe them dry, and then 
egg and crumb them, and fry them in drip- 
pings till they are brown, and lay tliem to 
dry on a hair sieve. Have ready a qirart 
of good beef gravy; it must be cold when 
you put tlie eels into it : set tliem on a slow- 
fire to simmer very gently for about a quar-

over a very clear fire, and broil your eels of 
a line crisp brown. Dish them with crisp 
parsley, and send up with plain butter in a 
boat, and anchovy and butter. , 

EGGS. (1) Eggs may be preserved for 
twelve month-, in a sweet and palatable state 
for eating in the shell, or using for salads, by 
Ixiiling them for one minute; and when 
wanted for use let tliem be boiled in the 
usual manner: tha white may be a little 
toucher than a new-laid egg, but the yolk 
will show no difference. 

EGGS. (2) Pour a gallon of water 
over a pound of unslacked lime, stir it well; 
tlw following day, pour off the clear water 
into a jar, and put in the eggs as they are 
laid. In this manner they will continue 
perfectly good for six months or more. 

There are so many different ways of 
dressing eggs, that the recipes would almost 
till a volume; we have, therefore, given such 
as we esteem the best, and the most adapted 
to the English taste. 

EGGS AND BACON RAGOUT. 

Boil half a dozen eggs for ten minutes; 
throw them into cold water; peel them and 
cut them into hahes; pound the yolks in a 
marble mortar, with about an equal quantity 
of the white mi-.it of dressed fowl, or \eal, a 
little clio|i|x-d parsley, an anchovy, an escha- 
lot, a quarter of an ounce of butter, a table- 
spoonful of mushroom catchup, a little Cay- 
enne, some bread-cmnibi, and a very little 
Ix-atcu mace, or allspice; incorporate them 
well togetlier, and till the halves of the 
whites with this mixture ; do them over 
witli (he yolk of an egg, and brown tliem in 
a Dutch oven, and serve them on relishing . 
rashers of bacon or ham. 

,/EGGS AND BREAD. Put half a hand- 
ful of bread crumbs into a saucepan, with a 
small quantity of cream, Kilt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and let it stand till die bread has 
i ml n! -d all the cream ; then break ten egge 
into it, and having Ix-aten them up together, 
fry it like an omelet. , 

EGGS AND CREAM. Boil half a pint 
of cream till reduced to half the quantity; 
then add eight eggs, season them with salt

and pepper, toil them together, till the eggs 
are partly hard ; pass ;i salamander over tlie 
top, and serve. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. Cut into thick 
round slices a dozen of hard-lx>iled eggs, 
and put them into the following sauce: cut 
three large white onions into dice, fry tliem 
white in butter, and when nearly done, dust 
them with flour, and moisten them with some 
milk and a few spoonfuls of cream; keep 
stirring with a wooden spoon, to prevent 
their burning. When the sauce is done, 
grate in a little nutmeg, season with a little 
salt and pepper, and put iu the eggs. 

EGG BALLS. Boil four eggs for ten 
minutes, and put diem into cold water; when 
they are quite cold, put the yolks into a 
mortar with the yolk of a raw egg, a tea- 
spoonful of flour, same of chopped parsley, 
ns much salt as will lie on a shilling, and a 
little black pepper, or Cayenne; rub them 
well together, roll them into small balls (as 
the\ suell in boiling); boil them a couple 
of minutes. 

EGGS BOILED, TO EAT IN THE 

SHKLI., OR FOR SALADS. The fresher 
laid the better: put them into boiling water; 
if you like the white just set, about two 
minutes boiling is enough; a new-laid egg 
will take a little more; if you wish the yolk 
to l set, it will take three, and to boil it 
hard for a salad, ten minutes. A new-laid 
egg will require boiling longer than a stale 
one, by half a minute. 

EGGS BOURGEOISE. Spread some 
butter over the bottom of a dish, cover it 
entirely with thin slices of crumb of bread, 
on that lay thin slices of cheese, then eight 
or ten eggs, season them with salt, pepper 
and nutmeg, set the dish over a stove to cook 
gently till done. 

EGGS, BUTTERED. Beat and strain 

ten or twelve egffs ; nut a piece of butter into 

i i 

a saucepan and keep turning it one way 

till melted ; put in the beaten eggs, and stir 
them round with a silver spoon till they be- 
come quite thick. Serve them in a dish 
upon buttered toast. They may be eaten 
with fish, fowl, or sausages. 

EGGS EN SURPRISE. Take a dozen 
eggs, and make a small hole at each end of 
every egg, through which pass a straw and 
break the yolk ; then blow out the yolk care- 
fully. Wash the shells, and having drained, 
dry them in the open air ; mix the yolk of 
an egg with a little flour to close one of the 
holes of the shells, and when dry, fill half the 
Dumber by means of a small funnel, with 



chocolate cream, and the remaining six with 
coffee or orange-cream ; close the other end 
of your eggs, and put them into a saucepan 
of hot water; set them on the fire, taking 
care they do not boil ; when done, remove 
ilie cement from the ends; dry, and serve 
them on a folded napkin. 

EGGS, FRIED. Eggs boiled hard, cut 
into slices, and fried, may be served as a 
second course dish, to eat with roasted 
chickens. 

EGGS FRIED WITH BACON. Lay 

some slices of fine streaked bacon (not more 
than a quarter of an inch thick) in a clean 
dish, and toast them before the fire in a 
cheese-toaster, turning diem when the upper 
side is browned ; first ask those who are to 
eat the bacon, if they wish it much or little 
done, f. e. curled and crisped, or mellow 
and soft: if the latter, parboil it first. Well- 
cleansed dripping, or lard, or fresh butter, 
are the best fats for frying eggs. Be sure 
the frying-pan is quite clean ; when the fat 
is hot, break two or three eggs into it ; do 
not turn them, but, while they are frying, 
keep pouring some of the fat over them with 
a spoon ; when the yolk just begins to look 
white, which it will in about a couple of 
minutes, they are done enough; the white 
must nut Inse its transparency, but, the yolk 
be seen blushing through it: if they are 
done nicely, they will look as white and 
delicate as if they had been poached ; take 
them up with a tin slice, drain the fat from 
them, trim them neatly, and send them up 
with the bacon round them. 

EGGS FRIED, AND MINCED HAM 

OR BACON. Choose some fine salt pork, 
streaked with a good deal of lean ; cut this 
into very thin slices, and afterward into 
small square pieces; throw them into a 
stewpan, and set it ever a gentle fire, that 
they may lose some of their fat. When as 
much as will freely come is thus melted from 
them, lay them on a warm dish. Put into 
;i sieupan a ladle-full of melted bacon or 
lard ; set it on a stove ; put in about a dozen 
of the small pieces of bacon, then stoop the 
stewpan and break in an egg. Manage this 
carefully, and the egg will presently be done: 
it will l>e very round, and the little dice of 
bacon will stick to it all over, so that it will 
make a very pretty appearance. Take care 
the yolks do not harden ; when the egg is 
thus done, lay it carefully in a warm dish, 
and do i he others. 

EGG FRITTERS. Pound a dozen 
hard boiled eggs with a little cream, and a 
quarter of a pound of beef marrow; then 
pound half a dozen macaroons, some bitter

almond*, a little sugar, and lemon-peel ; 
mix these with the |x>unded e:. r gs, and form 
them into fritters, dip them into a tauter 
made with Huur, butter, salt, and lemon- 
peel; fry them in very liot hird, sprinkle su- 
g-ar oxer, and serve. 

K< ;< iS FROTHED. Beat up the yolks 
of einht eims ami tile whites of four (set 
aside thr reiiiai'iiiii; whites) with a spoonful 
of water, smile salt, sugar, and tile juice ofa 
leui'in; fry this, and then put it on a dish;

K(iiS. TO I'OACH. The cook who

when the water boib, remove the stewpan 
from the stove, and gently slip the egg into 
it ; it must stand till the xvhite is set ; then 
put it oxer a very moderate fire, and as soon 
a* the water boils, the egg is ready; take it 
up with a slice, and neatly round off the 
ragged edges of the xvhite; send them up on 
bread to;isted on one side only, with or xvith- 
out butter; or without a toast, garnished 
with streaked bacon nicely fried, or j-lices 
of broiled beef or mutton, anchoxii >. |n,rk 
sausages, or spinage. The bread should 1 
a little larger than the egg, and aliout a 
quarter of an inch thick; only just u'ixc it a 
yellow color: if you toast it brown, it will 
get a bitter flavour; or moisten it by |xmr- 
mg a little hot water upon it: some sprinkle 
it with a few drops of vinegar, or of essence 
of anchovy. 

K(i(;s POACHED, WITH SAUCE OF 
MINCED HAM. I'oach the eggs as before 
directed, and take two or three slices of 
lx>ilcd ham; mince it fine with a gherkin, a 
morsel of onion, a little parsley, and |>epper 
and salt ; stew all together a quarter of ail 
hour; serve up your saiieealxiul half boiling; 
put the e|,'<;s in a dish, squeeze over the juice 
of half a .Seville orange, or lemon, and JXHIT 
the sauce over them. 

EGG PUNCH. Take a punch--la>.<, 
and put into it a xvinc-gla.-s (if sirup of punch 
(see that article), and the yolk of an egg; 
Ix-at them together xvith a spoon, and then 
fill up the glass with boiling water, stirring 
a little as xou pour it in. 

EGG TOAST. Put a glass of thick 
cream, some sugar, two or three macaroons 
|xinnded, w itli a fexv almonds, a little grated 
lemon, give them a boil; then add the yolks 
of eight and whites of three eggs, Ix-at the 
whole up over a slow fire; and lay on very 
thin slices of fried bread ; sprinkle sugar 
over, and serve. 

EGG WINE. Beat up an egg, mix with 
it a spoonful of cold water ; set on the fire a 

glass of xvhite wine, half a l:tss of water, 
.-ii'/ar, and nutmeg. When it Ixiils, |x>ur a 
little of it to the p^g by degree--, till the 
whole is in, stirring it well; then return the 
wliole into the saucepan, set it over a uentle 
fire, stir it one way for a minute, not longer, 
1 for if it boil, or the egg is stale, it will cm .lie ; 
SWlll with toast. You may make it as above, 
without xvarmiir^ the (_",'. and it xvill be 
lighter on the stomach, though not so agree-

or four hours in brandy, sugar, orange-flower 
water, and lemon-peel; when drained, dip 
them in a good thick batter to fry, and serve 
with rasped sugar, as in general. 

ELDER ROB. Gather the elderberries 
when quite ripe, put them into a stone jar, 
tie a bladder or paper over the top, and 
plan- the jar in a pan of water ; let it boil 
till the berries are very soft; strain them 
through a coarse cloth, and to every pint of 
juice allow half a pound of good brown su- 
gar; put it into a preserving-pan, stir it, and 
when it boils, take off the scum, and let it 
boil for one hour. 

ELDER VINEGAR. Choose the elder- 
flowers when just blown, lake away all the 
stalks, and when the flowers are alx>ut 
half dry, put them into a jar, and fill the jar 
with \inegar, close it tight, and let it stand 
in die sun for twenty days ; then draw it off, 
press the flowers, and having filtered the 
whole, bottle it; take care to keep the bot- 
tles closely corked. 

ELDERBERRIES. Can be made to 
produce excellent wine, allowing to a ten- 
gallon cask forty pounds of fruit, forty pounds 
of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar. 
When elderberry wine is desired for a warm 
cordial, it is made in the following manner: 
Twenty-five pounds of fruit are to be boil- 
ed for an hour, in eleven gallons of watci , 
and along with it, tied in a piece of linen, 
one ounce of allspice, and two of ginger; 
forty pounds of sugar being put into a tub, 
die boiling liquor is strained over it, pressing 
the fruit quite dry ; a quarter of a pound of 
crude tartar, or cream of tartar, is dieu 
added to the liquid. When it has stood two 
days in the tub, it may lie removed to the 
cask, treated, as for sweet wuie, in the usual 
manner, and bottled in March following. 
When to be drank, a portion of it is heated 
with some sugar, two or three cloves, and a 
little nutmeg. 

EM POT AGE. Put into a large sauce- 
pan, three or four pounds of beef-steaks, a 
knuckle of veal, and four old liens ; moisten 
this quantity of meat with two ladlcsful of 
broth ; set it on a stove, and let it boil till 
properly reduced, taking care that none of 
the meat burns, which would make the 
empotage of too high a color ; fill up your 
saucepan with broth, adding carrots, turnips, 
and onions; let all lliese ingredients stand 
over the fire for three hours and a half; then 
strain the whole tlirough a silk sieve, that 
it may be perfectly clear. 

ENDIVE IN VELOUTE. Take off 
all the outer leaves of your endive, and having 



opened tlie hearts, put tliem into cold water 
to wa>h them. In the meanwhile heat a 
kettle of water, put in it a handful of salt, 
then throw in the endive ; keep it constantly 
under the water, to prevent their turning 
black. As soon as the endive is tender, 
drain, and then put it into cold water, and 
when quite cold, drain it again ; press the 
water out with your hands ; then chop it 
small, and put it into a saucepan, with some 
butler, sail, and pepper, stir it well, and 
then add five spoonfuls of veloute, the same 
of consomme; reduce it till pretty thick, and 
then put it in a dish, with fried bread round 
it. Endive may also be dressed with cream, 
in which case, put two spoonfuls of flour into 
it, and moisten it with cream. 

ENDIVE IN GRAVY OF VEAL. 

Wash and clean thoroughly ten or twelve 
heads of fine endive, take off the outer leaves, 
and blanch the heads in hot w ater ; throw 
them into cold water, and then squeeze them 
as dry as possible. Stew them in as much 
gravy as will cover them; add a tea-spoon- 
ful of pounded sugar, and a little silt . Wlien 
perfectly tender, put in a little veloute sauce, 
and serve quite hot. 

ENTREE. There is no word precisely 
equivalent to this in English. Any dish of 
butcher 's meat, fowl, game, or fish, dressed 
for the first course, is called an entree. 

ENTREMET. There is no word equiv- 
alent to this in English. All dishes of veg- 
etables, jellies, pastries, salad, prawns, lob- 
sterV, and, in general, everything that appears 
iu the second course, except the roast, is 
called an entremet. 

ESCHALOT WINE. Peel, mince, and 
pound in a mortar, three ounces of eschalots, 
and infuse them in a pint of Sherry for ten 
days; then pour off the clear liquor on three 
ounces more eschalots, and let the wine 
stand on them ten days longer. This is 
rather the most expensive, but infinitely 
the most elegant preparation of eschalot, 
and imparts the onion flavour to soups and 
sauces, for chops, steaks, or broiled meats, 
hashes, &c. more agreeably than any : 
it does not leave any unpleasant taste in 
die moudi, or to die breath ; nor repeat, 
as almost all odier preparations of garlic, 
onion, &c. do. N. B. An ounce of scraped 
horseradish may be added to die above, and 
a little thin-cut lemon-peel. 

ESPAGNOLE. Take an old fowl, and 
about fourteen pounds of leg or shoulder of 
veal ; chop the latter into pieces, and put it, 
with very little water, into a large saucepan, 
widi two carrots, three onions, a pound of

wheat, or anything else, with the point of a

baking, that they may be crisp. Coarse 
powder sugar may also be strewed over, be- 
fore they are put in the oven. 

FISH. We intert all the beat remark* 
that various culinary authors have made 
on FISH. 

There is a general rule in choosing 
most kinds of fish; if their gills are red, 
their eyes plump, and the whole fi.-h stiff, 
they are good; if, on the contrary, the gills 
are pale, the eyes sunk, and the ti.sh flabby, 
they are stale. The greatest care should 
Ix' taken that the fish is properlv clean-Jtd 
Ix-fore Ix-iiig dressed, but not washed be- 
yond what is absolutely neces>arv for clean- 
ing, as by perpetual watering, the flavour 
is diminished. When clean, if the fish is 
to be boiled, some salt, and a little vinegar 
should be put into the water, to give it 
firmness. Care should lie taken to ln.il the 
fish well, but not to let it break. Cod, 
whiting, and haddock are much Ix-tter fur 
little salted, and kept fur a day. 

There is "!':en a muddy smell and ta.-ie at- 
tached to iVesh-water li.-h, which may Ixj 
got rid of I iy soaking it, after it has been 
thoroughly cleaned in strong salt and wa- 
ter; or, if the fish is not too lai\'e, scald it 
in the same; then dry, and die-:, it. 

< 'are should l<e taken that the li.-h is put into 
cold nater, anil allowed to do \er\ gently, 
otherwise the outside will break before the 
hi.-ide is done. 

( 'i imp lirh must be put into Ixtilii 
and as soon as it boils up, a little cold 
water should Ix. 1 put in, to check lhe<xr<-s- 
si\e heat, and simmer il for a few minute!. 

If the fish is not taken out of (In 1 water 
the instant it is done, it will become wixil- 
Iv; to ascertain when it is midy, the fish 
plate on which it is drtwed may Ixj drawn 
up, and if s'lilicientiv done, it will leau- the 
bone. To keep hot . ajid to 

prevent it from losing its color, the full 
plate should be plan over the 

lish-kettle, and a clean cloth put over the fish. 

Small fish may be either nicely fried 
plain, or done over with egg and bread 
crumbs, and tlien fried. I'pon the di-n in 
which the fish ie to be served, should be

placwl a folded damask napkin, and upon 
this put the fish, with the liver and roe; 
then garnish tle dish with horse-radish, 
parsley, and leinon. Fish is a dish which 
is almost more attended to titan any other. 

To fry or broil fish properly, after it 
is well cleaned and washed, it should be 
wrapped in a nice soft cloth, and when 
perfectly dry, wetted with egg, and sprink- 
led all over with very fine bread crumbs; it 
will look still better to be done over with 
egg and crumbs a second time. Then hav- 
ing on the fire a thick-bottomed frying-pan, 
with plenty of lard or dripping, boiling hot ; 
put the fish into it, and let it fry tolerably 
quick till it is done, and of a nice brown 
yellow. If it is done before it has obtained 
a nice brown color, the pan should be drawn 
to the side of the fire, the fish carefully 
taken up, and placed either upon a sieve 
turned upwards, or on the under side of 
a dish, and placed before the fire to drain, 
and finish browning; if wanted particularly 
nice, a sheet of cap paper must be put to 
receive the fish. I-'ish fried in oil obtains a 
much finer color than when done in lard or 
dripping. Butter should never be used, as 
it gives a bad color. Garnish your dish 
with a fringe of curled raw parsley, or with 
fried parsley. 

When fish is to be broQed, it must be 
seasoned, floured, and done on a very clean 
gridiron; which, when hot, should be rub- 
bed over with suet, to hinder the fish from 
sticking. It should be broiled over a very 
clear fire, to prevent its tasting sjnoky, and 
great care must be taken not to scorch it. 

FISH. This department of the busi- 
ness of the kitchen requires considerable ex- 
perience, and depends more upon practice 
than any other. A very few moments, more j 
or less, will thoroughly spall fish ; which, to 
be eaten in perfection, must never be put j 
on the table till the soup is taken off. 

So many circumstances operate on this 
occasion, that it is almost impossible to 
write general rules. 

There are decidedly different opinions, 
whether (Lsh should be put into cold, tepid, 
or boiling water. 

Fish must by no means be allowed to re- 
main in the water after it is boiled ; if 
therefore it should be ready before it can be 
gent to table, it must be dished, the cover 
put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish 
is then to be set across the fish-kettle. 

Fish should be fried over a clear quick 
fire ; and with dripping, or hog's lard in 
preference to butler. The pan should be 
deep; and to ascertain that it is clean, a 
little fat is first fried in it, poured out, and 
the pan wiped with a clean cloth; as much , 
dripping or lard is then put in as will en- 



tirely cover the fish. When it is boiling 
hot, and begins to smoke, the fish is put in ; 
if small, they may be turned in three or four 
minutes, by sticking in a fork near the head 
with one hand, and with the other support- 
ing die tail with a fish-slice. When they 
arc done, they should be laid before the 
fire upon an old soft towel, and turned now 
and then till they are dry upon both sides ; 
or they may be put upon a large sieve, 
turned upwards, and which is kept for the 
purpose, or put on the under side of a dish. 

The fire for broiling fish must be very 
clear, and the gridiron perfectly clean, 
which, when hot, should be rubbed with a 
bit of suet. The fish, while broiling, must 
be often turned. 

Several respectable fishmongers and ex- 
perienced cooks have assured the editor, 
that they are often in danger of losing dieir 
credit by fish too fresh, and especially tur- 
bot ami cod, which, like meat, require a 
certain time before they are in the best con- 
dition to be dressed. They recommend 
them to be put into cold water, salted in 
proportion of about a quarter of a pound of 
salt to a gallon of water. Sea-water is 
best to boil sea-fish in. It not only saves the 
expense of salt, but the flavor is better. Let 
them boil slowly till done; the sign of which 
is, that the skin of the fish rises up, and 
tin- e\es turn white. 

It is die business of the fishmonger to 
clean them, &c. but the careful cook will 
always wash them again. 

(iiunish with slices of lemon, finely scrap- 
ed horseradish, fried oysters, smelts, whit- 
iiiljs or strips of soles. 

The liver, roe, and chitterlings should be 
placed so that the carver may observe them, 
and invite the guest to partake of them. 

Fish, like meat, requires more cooking 
in cold than in warm weather. If it be- 
comes FROZEN, it must be thawed by the 
means we have directed for meat. 

Fish are plenty and good, and in great 
variety, in all tlie towns and cities on the 
extensive coast of the United States. Some 
of the interior towns are also supplied with 
fish peculiar to the lakes and rivers of this 
country. 

All "kinds of fish are best sometime before 
they begin to spawn ; and are unfit for food 
for sometime after they have spawned. 

Fish, like animals, are fittest for the ta- 
ble when they are just full grown ; and what 
has been said i-especting vegetables, applies 
equally well to fish. 

The most convenient utensil to boil fish 
in, is a turbot-kettle. This should be 
twenty-four inches long, twenty-two wide, 
and nine deep. It is an excellent Tessel to 
boil a ham in, &c. &c. 

N. B. The liver of the fish pounded and

FLE 



mixed with batter, with a little lemon-juice, 
&c. is an elegant and inoffensive relish to 
fish. Mushroom sauce extempore or tile 
soup of mock turtle, will make an excellent 
fish gauce. 

For liquids, you have meat gravy, lemon- 
juice, sirup of lemons, essence of anehovy, 
the various vegetable essences, uiuslirixmi 
catchup, and the whites and yolks of eggs, 
win. -, and the essence of spices. 

I'lSH, NBW METHOD OF DRESSING. 
Take any sort of fish you think prujxir, l>e- 
ing very careful that it is (juitc fresh; clean 
it Thoroughly, dry, and season it to your 
taste; then put it (without any moisture), 
into a [Ktn, which may be closely covered, 
with the exception of a small hole, to allow 
uioii. 1'ut it into an oven as soon 
as the bread is drawn, and let it stand until 
the whole is so completely cliss. 

BJ are not perceptible. When cold, 
this makes a very transparent, well-flavored 
jelly. 

F I S 1 1 < '( ).\ s >.M M E. Take carp, tench, 

I--, pike, and other fre.-h-watcr lish 

of the same kind; clean them well, and cut 

them into pieces, as near of a size as may 

be; lay them in a stewpan, on a la\rr of 

as soon as they 

lieu'in d> sweat, put in a bit of butter, and 
leave tlicm lor a quarter of an hour; mois- 
ten them with lish broth, and let them boil 
gently for an hour; keep the pan closely 
. this will afford a very nourishing 
broth. 

FISH KETCHUP. Take rather more 
:<hit of vinegar, three pints of red 
Port, two table-spoonfuls of pepper, pound- 
ed very fine, plenty of shallots and Imise- 
radi.-h, the IMI-I of hall" a lemon, and two or 
three bay-leaves, and a pound of anchovies; 
Jet the whole Imil together until the ancho- 
vies are dissolved, then strain, and when 
cold, put it into bottles. Two or three 
FjyxHifuls are sufficient lor a jyjund of 

batter. 



FISH FOiUT.MF.AT. Take two oun- 
ces of either turUit. . siirim|k<, 
-; free from ski.i, put it in a mor- 
tar with two minces of I', !i butler, one 
.iiini-e of bread-crumbs, the volk of

Inou-peel, and parslev, min.-ed very line; 
then jKiiind it well till it is thoroughly mixed 
and quite smooth; season it with ~.i\i and 
Cayenne to your taste ; break in the volk 

IM white of one egg, rob it well toother, 

and it is readv lor use. Ovsfers parboiled 
Uiid minced line, and an anchovy, may Ix; 
added. 



PISH GRAVY. (1) Cut two or three 

little lull of any kind into small pieces; put 
them into a saucepan, with rather more 
water than will cover them, a bit of toasted 
bread, a blade of mace, some lemon-prel, 
whole jM-pper, and a bunch of sweet herbs; 
let it simmer gently till ii is rich and good; 
brown a little bit of Imtter in a stew pan, 
and when it is browned, strain the uravy in- 
to it, and let it boil for a few minutes. 

FISH (Ill.VVV. (2) Put some slices 
of onion into a .-tevtpan, and set them on 
the lire; when they an- completely dissolved, 
add a piece of butter, and some small lish, 
or pieces of carp, tench, perch, or any other 
you linil convenient. As soon as they begin 
to dissolve, and give out their moisture, put 
a ylas.-|iil of root broth to them, and boil 
them for half an hour; then add a glass of 
white wine, and a little lemon-juice, and 
boil it another half hour, wlien it may be 
pressed through a sieve, with great force. 

FISH RECHAUFFE. (1) After pike, 
cod, skate, tin I .1, soli>. or any other white 
fish has Ix^en dressed, pick it from the bones 
into small bits ; add to a pound of fish, or 
in the same proportion, half a pint of good 
cream, one table-spoonful of mustard, the 
same of anchovy essence, the same of ketch- 
up, and of Harvey sauce, a little flour, some 
salt, pepper, and butter; make it all hot in 
the xiuce|xui, then put it into the dish in 
which it is to be served up, strew crumbs 
of bread over it, and baste it with butter till 
it is a little moist, then brown it with a 
salamander, or in a Dutch oven. A wall 
ot ma.-hed potatoes roiuld the dish is an im- 
provement. 

FISH RECHAUFFE. (2) Pick from 
the bone in large flakes about two pounds 
of cold salmon, codfish, or soles; melt a 
quarter of a |>ound of butter in half a pint of 
cream, with a little flour and salt; add the 
fish and heat it thoroughly.

which should be square, with a little butter ; 
fill one side with the mixture, and close 
them ; when one side is done turn the oth- 
er, and when of a fine color, take out the 
wafers ; put them upon a plate, and whilst 
hot, sift over this quantity a quarter of a 
pound of grated loaf sugar. 

FLIP. To make a quart of flip: Put 
the ale on the fire to warm, and beat up 
three or four eggs, with four ounces of moist 
sugar, a tea-spoonful of grated nutmeg or 
ginger, and a quartern of good old ruin or 
brandy. When the ale nearly boils put it 
into one pitcher, and the rum, eggs, &c. in- 
to another ; turn it from one to another till 
it is a smooth as cream. This is called a 
Yard of Flannel. 

FLOATING ISLAND. Boil, with a 
pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, and half the 
peel of a lemon; when almost cold, strain it, 
and mix with it the beaten white of one, and 
the yolks of three eggs ; stir itover die fire till 
thick, pour it into a dish, and stir it now 
and then till cold. Whisk the whites of 
two eggs, and half a pint of Guava, quince, 
or red currant jelly, till it be a very stiff". 

FLOUNDERS BOILED. (1) Put on a 
stewpan with a sufficient quantity of water 
to cover the flounders which are to be dres- 
sed ; put in some vinegar and horse-radish ; 
when the water boils put in the fish, having 
lieen first well cleaned, and their fins cut off; 
they must not boil too fast for fear they should 
break; when they are sufficiently done, lay 
them on a fish plate, the tails in the middle. 
Serve them with parsley and butter. 

FLOUNDERS BOILED. (2) Wash and 
clean them well, cut the black side of them 
the same as you do turbot, then put them in- 
to a (i.-li-kettle, with plenty of cold water 
and a handful of salt ; when they come to a 
boil, skim them clean, and let them stand 
by the side-of die fire for five minutes, and 
diey are ready. Obs. Eaten with plain 
melted butter and a little salt, you have the 
sweet delicate flavor of die flounder, which 
is overpowered by any sauce. 

FLOUNDERS OR PLAICE, FRIED OR 
BOILED. Flounders are perhaps the most 
(iiiiirult fish to fry very nicely. (.'Iran them 
well, flour them, and wi| them widi a dry 
cloth to absorb all die water from diem; 
flour or egg and bread-crumb them. 

FLUMMERY. Steep three large hand- 

fuls of very small white oatmeal 4 day and 
night in cold water; then pour it oft' clear; 
then add as much more water, and let h 
stand anodier dav and a night. Then 



strain it through a fine hair sieve, and boil 
it till it is of the conMstence of hasty pud- 
ding, keeping it well stirred all die time it 
is boiling. When first strained, put to it 
one large s|xniful of white sugar, and two 
of orange-flower water. Pour it into shal- 
low dishes, and scrxe to eat with wine, ci- 
der, milk or ccpam, and sugar. 

FLUMMERY DUTCH. Boil very 

irenlly for half an hour, two ounces of isin- 
;:!a.-.- in three half pints of water; add a pint 
of white wine, the juice of three lemons and 
the thin rind of one, and nib a few lumps 
of sugar on another to obtain the essence, 
and with them add as much more sugar as 
will make it sufficiently sweot ; and having 
beaten up the yolks of se\en eggs, give diem 
and the above, when mixed, one scald; stir 
all the time, and pour the whole into a ba- 
sin; stir it till it is half cold; then let it 
settle, and put it into a melon shape. 

FLUMMERY FRENCH. Beat an 
ounce of isinglass line, put it into a quart of 
cream, and boil it gently for a quarter of an 
hour, keeping it stirring all the time. Then 
take it off, sweeten it ith tine powder su- 
gar, put in a s|Mxinfiil of rose and another 
of orange-dower water, strain it through a 
sieve, and stir it till half cold. Put it into 
a mould or basin, and when cold, turn it in- 
to a dish, and garnish with currant jelly. 

FONDUS. Put some grated cheese into 
a basin, with pepper and a little melted liut- 
ter, and the yolks of eggs; stir them togeth- 
er; whip the whites of the eggs to a firm 
froth, and add them, a little at a time, to 
the cheese, stirring lightly with a wooden 
spoon; half till as many paper OUtt 
can, and bake them, like biscuits, in a 
| moderate oven. Serve them as quickly as 
possible after they are done. 

FORCEMEAT STUFFING. Force- 
meat is now considered an indispensable 
accompaniment to most made dishes, and 
when composed \\illi good taste, gives ad- 
ditional spirit and relish to even that " sove- 
! reign of savouriness," turtle soup. 

It is also sent up in patties, and for stuf- 
fing of veal, game, pnultn 

The ingredients should t>e so proportion- 
ed, that no one flavor pred in 

To give the same stuffing for veal, hare, 
&c. argues a poverty of inu-ntinn; with a 
little contrivance, jou may make as great 
a variety as you have dishes. 

The poignancy of forcemeat should be 
proportioned to the savonriness of the \ iandri, 
to which it is intended to give OS additional 
est. Some dishes require a very delicate- 
ly flavored forcemeat, for others, it must

For boiling, choose those that are not 
black-legged; pick them carefully, singe. 
wash, and truss them. Flour them, and 
put them in boiling water; a good-sized 
one will be done in half an hour. 

Serve with parsley and butter; oyster, 
lemon, liver, or celery sauce. If for dinner, 
ham, tongue, or bacon, is commonly served 
with them. 

Fowls are trussed in the same manner as 
chickens. (See Chickens). 

Chickens or fowls should be killed at 
least one or two days before they are to he 



Turkeys (especially large ones) should 
not be dressed till they have been killed 
three or four days at least, in cold weather 
six or eight, or they will neither look white 
nor eat tender. 

Turkeys, and large fowls, should have 
the strings or sinews of the thighs drawn 
out. 

Truss them with the legs outward, they 
are much easier carved. 

FOWL A LA HOLANDAISE. Make 

a forcemeat of grated bread, half its quantity 
of minced suet, an onion, or a few oysters, 
and some boiled parsley, season with pepper, 
salt, and grated lemon-peel, and an egg 
lieaten up to bind it. Bone the breast of a 
good-sized young fowl, put in the forcemeat, 
rover the fowl with a piece of white paper 
Iwttered, and roast it rather more than half 
an hour; have ready a thick batter made of 
flour, milk, and eggs, take off the paper, and 
|xnir some of the batter over the fowl; as 
soon as it becomes dry add more, and do 
this till it is all enisled over, and of a nice 
brown color ; serve it with melted butter and 
lemon pickle, or a thickened brown gravy. 

FOWL BOILED WITH RICE. Stew 
a fowl in some well-skimmed clear mutton 
broth, and seasoned with onion, mace, pep- 
per, and salt. About half an hour before it 
is ready, put in a quarter of a pint of rice 
well washed and soaked. Simmer till ten- 
der ; then strain it from the broth, and put 
the rice on a sieve before tile tire. Keep the 
fowl hot, lay it in the middle of a dish, and 
the rice round it without the broth. The 
less liquor the fowl is done with, the better. 
Serve with gravy, or parsley and butter for 



FOWL BROILED. Split diem down 
the back, well salt and pepper them; then 
broil them. Serve with mushroom sauce. 

FOWL CAPILOTADE. Take the re- 
mains of a ready dressed fowl, and put 
them into a slewpan; then do up some 
parsley, shallots, and four mushrooms, all 



slued small, in a little letter; as soon as the 
latter Incomes liquid, add four ladk-fuls of 
espagnole, and two of consomme, reduce, 
and skim it ; pour it on your fowl, set it on 
the fire to simmer for a quarter of an hour, 
l>efore you send it to table. 

FOWL CURRY. See Curry. 

FOWLS DRESSED TO DRESS 

AGAIN. Cut them in quarters, beat up an 
egg or two (according to die quantity you 
dress) with a little grated nutmeg, and pep- 
per and salt, some parsley minced fine, and 
a few crumbs of bread; mix these well to- 
gether, and cover the fowl, &c. with this 
batter; broil them, or put them in a Dutch 
oven, or have n-ady some dripping hot in a 
pan, in which fry them a light brown color; 
thicken a little gravy with some flour, put 
a large spoonful of catchup to it, lay the 
fry in a dish, and pour the sauce round it. 
You may garnish with slices of lemon and 
toasted bread. 



Turkey, Goose, Duck, Rabbit, 
Pigeon, are all dressed same way. 

FOWL, GAME, OR RABBIT HASH- 
F.D. Cut them into joints, put the trim- 
mings into a stewpan with a quart of 
the broth thev were boiled in, and a large 
onion cut in tour; let it boil half an hour; 
strain it through a sieve: then put two table- 
spoonfuls of flour in a basin, and mix it 
well by degrees with the hot broth; set it 
on the fire to Iwil up, then strain it through a 
fine sieve: wash out the stewpan, lay the poul- 
try in it, and pour the gravy on it (through 
a sieve) ; set it by tlie side of the fire to 
simmer very gently (it must not Ixiil) for 
fifteen minutes; live minutes before you 
serve it up, cut the stufliii<; in slices, and 
put it in to warm, then take it out, and lay 
it round the edge of the dish, and put the 
poultry in the middle; carefully skim the 
(at off the gravy, then shake it round well 
in the stewpan, and pour it to the; hash.

sippets lightly toasted. 

FOWL HASHED. Cut a cold roasted 
fowl into pieces as for a fricassee, |it the 
trimmings into a saucepan with two or three 
shallots, a little lemon-|>eel, a blade ol'mace, 
a quarter of a pound of lean ham, and a pint 
of stock; simmer it for half an hour, strain 
it, put a bit of butter into a saucepan, and 
when melted, dredge in as much flour as will 
dry it up, stirring it all the time; then add 
the gravy, let it boil a minute, and put in the 
fowl, also a little pepper, salt, and a dust of 
sugar. Before serving, squeeze in a little 
lemon-juice.

FOWL ROASTED WITH CHEST- 
NUTS. Roast some cliestnuts, very care- 
fiilly, so that they may not be burnt, then 
lake oil' the skins, and peel them. Take 
alxiut a dozen of them, cut them small, and 
bruise them in a mortar. 1'arlxiil the liver 
of a fowl ; brui.se it, and cut about a quarter 
of a |xiiiiid of ham or bacon, and pound it. 
Then mix them all together, with a good 
quantity of chopped parsley, sweet herbs, 
some mace, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. When 
these are are all well mixed togetlier,. put it 
into your fowl, and roast it. The Ix'st way 
of doing this is to tie the neck, and hang it 
up I iv the legs to roast, witli a string, and 
then baste it with butter. For sauce, take 
the rest of the che.-tnnts, peel and skin them, 
put them into some good gravy, with a little 
white wine; and thicken it with a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Then place your fowl 
in the dish; pour in the sauce; garnish with 
lemon, and serve.

sweet herbs, three cloves, sliced onions, 
carrot.-, pepper, salt, a little stock, and a 
gla.-s of white wine; stew them gently till 
they are done ; skim and strain the sauce, 
and serve il with the fowl. 

FOWL, WILD. Tle flavor of wild 
fowl is preserved better bv not stuffing them ; 
put into each, peppT, salt, and a bit of but- 
ter. Wild fowl do not require so much 
dressing as tame ; tliey should be done of a 
line color, and nicely frothed. A rich brown 
niavy sjionld ! served ill the dish, and when 
the breast is cut into slices, bcfiuv it is taken 
from the Ixine, it will lie much improved by

Until it lias l>ilcd ten minutes, taking great 
care that il does nut burn; then |xjur it into 
a basi.i. and let it cool. Take a few al- 
monds, (to every six sweet put one bitter), 
bruise them, and some macaroons, and when 
reduced to powder, mix them with a little 
cris|>ed orange-Hour (also in powder), and a 
suiiieieiit quantity of pq wder-0ugar to BweeteH 
il : add these to the above preparation, and 
stir them in well with a wooden spoon. If 
your frangipane be too thick, add anotlior 
etrg or two, and then make whatever use of 
il yon may desire. You may, if you think 
proper, substitute pistachios for the sweet 
almonds, in which case a little spinach es- 
sence must IK- added to color it, tile maca- 
roons and orange-flowers omitted, and three 
bitter almonds only used. 

FRE.\CH BEANS. Cut off the stalk 
end first, and then turn to the point and 
strip off the strings. If not quite fresh, have 
a bowl of spring-water, with a little salt 
dissolved in it, standing before yon, and as 
the beans are cleaned and stringed, throw 
them in. When all are done, put them on 
the fire in boiling water, with some sail in 
it; after they have boiled fifteen or twenty 
minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon 
as they are tender take them up; throw 
them into a colander or sieve to drain. To 
.Bend up the beans whole is much the l>e.-t 
method when they are thus young, and their 
delicate flavor and color are much tetter 
preserved. When a little more grown, they 
must Ix: cut across in two after stringing; 
and for common tables they are split, and 
divided across ; cut them all the same length ; 
but those who are nice never have them at 
such a growth as to require splitting. When 
they are very large tliey look pretty cut into 
kr/enges.

when the chickens are boiled tender, have 
ready six or seven well-leaten e 
them quickly into the broth one way, imme- 
diately before taking it olV the fire. This 
broth may be made entirely of veal instead

being put on the cream, &c, with a spoon, 



it will take any form ; it should be rough, 
to imitate a rock. 

FRUIT, CANDIED. (1) It must first be 
preserved, then dipped in warm water, dried 
with a cloth, and strewed all over with sift- 
ed sugar, and dried in a stove or oven, turn- 
ing as occasion requires. 

FRUIT, CANDIED. (2) When the 
fmit is preserved, dry it in a stove till the 
sirup is quite out, dip it into sirup boiled to 
randy height, and dry it again. All dried 
and candied fruit must lie kept in a very 
dry place. 

FRUIT IN JELLY. Have in read mess 
a plain mould, either long or round, about 
three inches deep; then have ready some 
mould jelly, and spread it at the Ixjltom 
of the mould, about a quarter of an inch 
thick ; let it be cold ; then put in ripe peach- 
es, grapes, or any sort of ripe fruit you 
please, preserved fruit, or China oranges 
cut into quarters, or whatever sha|>e. you 
choose; put in a little warm jelly, and let it 
stand till it is, cold, to fasten the fruit in its 
place, otherwise it will rise up; then fill the 
mould up with warm jelly, let it stand till it 
is quite cold, then turn it into a dish, and 
garnish it according to your own taste. 

FRUIT, PRESERVED, REMARKS 
ON USING. Preserved fruits should not be 
baked long; those that have l>een preserved 
with their full proportion of sugar, require 
no baking; the crust should be baked in a 
tin shape, and the fruit be ^afterward.- added; 
or it may be put into a small dish or tart- 
pans, and the covers be baked on a tin cut 
out according to your taste. 

FRUIT, TO PREPARE FOR BRANDY. 

Take the proposed quantity of fruit, gather- 
ed before they are perfectly ripe ; dry them 
carefullv, prick and put them into cold water ; 
when all in, set the vessel over a moderate 
fire, keeping the water, however, constantly 
nearly boiling, until die fruit will give to the 
touch; then throw them, with great care, 
into cold water again; drain away this wa- 
ter, and add fresh; change the water t uice 
more within a quarter of an hour, after 
which, drain them for the last time, and |iut 
them in bottles; if any of the fruit is the 
least broken or bruised, it must be put aside, 
as it would spoil the rest. In the mean- 
while, take a proper quantity of sugar (as a 
pound and a half for twenty-live peache*)j 
clarify and boil it to la nappe; measure, 
and put double its quantity of good brandy; 
mix and jiour them into a glazed pan; let 
them stand awhile, and then pour the mix- 
ture on the fruit.

G. 



< i \ M T. In choosing venison, the fat of 
that which is good is thick , clear, and bright ; 
the clift part smooth and close. When the 
veni- ia is |x'ifecily fresh, it is hung in a cool 
place, ami carefully wiped dry every day. 
When extreme tenderness is required from 
long keeping. Ixit without its having a high 
flavor, it is well rubbed over with powdered 
charcoal. 

Tlie haunch is the prime joint, and when 

.aired to be roasted, it is lirst well 
washed in lukewarm milk-and-water, and 
then made i|iiile dry l>ef >re it is spitted. It 
is then co\ered with a slieet of well-buttered 
white pajxT, over which is laiii 
paste of tloiir-and- water, about a quarter of 
an inch thick; thin is again covered with 
buttered white |xi|x-r, and tied on with pack- 
thread. A substantial fire being made, the 
haunch is put d.iwn, and constantly basted 
with freijh beef dripping, till nearly done, 
when the IM.-IC is taken oil", the meat well 
basted with butter, ami lightly dredged with 
flour, till it froths anil becomes of a line lijiht 
brown color. It i> signed with its own gra- 
vy in the dish, if there be enough of it; also 
a sauce tureen of good brown gravy, and 
one of currant jelly sauce beat up, and melt- 
ed with a little I'ort wine and sugar. 

\ : haunch takes about four hours to 
roast. 

A neck and shoulder, when roasted, is 
managed in the tame wav as the haunch, 
omitting the (Kiste; but it is more frequently 
used tin soups, pasties, and colloji-. 

-When fresh, the body is stiff; 
ami if \"iin_', the claws are smooth and 
sharp, the ears tender and easily torn. 
Hares arc kept from a week to a fortnight 
for roasting; but for soup, they cannot have 
been too recently killed. 

Rabbits are chosen by the same rules as 

Wild fowl, in general, is chosen 1>\ tlie 
same rules as tame poultry. Tlie binls 
should In- plump and fat, and hard in tlie 
vent. If the skin comes o(V wlien ruldied 
hard with the linger, they are stale. Old 
birds improve by keeping for sometime; 



young birds are best if dressed soon; and 
small birds, of all descriptions, should be 
immediately dressed. In warm -weather, a 
stop|x-r of charcoal should be put into the 
vent of all game, and a string tied tightly 
round the neck. 

To roast pheasants and partridge.-, they 
are picked, cleaned, and nicely singed; a 
slit is made in the back part of tlie neck, and 
the craw taken out, leaving on the head, tlie 
feet twisted closely to the body, the claws 
cut off, and tlie head turned under the wing. 
Both sorts are roasted by the directions for 
roasting a turkey or a fowl. A pheasant is 
served with gravy in the dih ; partridges 
with a gravy, or laid upon buttered toast, 
and melted Uitter poured round them. Bread 
sauce is served with both. A pheasant will 
require nearly an hour to roast ; partridges 
half an hour. Guinea and pea-tow I arc 
roasted in the same way as pheasants. 

To roast black-cock, follow the directions 
for roast ing pheasants and partri 
will require an hour, and is served with gra- 
vy in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce 
tureen. 

Moorfowl are roasted in the same manner, 
and require three-quarters of an hour. They 
may be served upon buttered toast, or with 
ura\y in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce 
tureen. 

To restore tainted game or poultry, pick 
it carefully, clean, and wash it, then put into 
each bird a little newly-made pounded char- 
coal, tied in a bit of muslin. Before sen ing, 
take out the bag, which will have a most 
olVen.-.ive smell, while tlie bird will be left 
(HTtectly sweet. 

To roast u ild duck. It should he roasted 
by a ((nick lire, well basted with butter, and 
browned. It will require miirly three-quar- 
ters of an hour, and when to be served, some 
beef gravy is poured through the duck into 
the dish, and in a sauce tureen some hot 
Port wine is served. The carver makes 
four cuts along the breast, it is then sprin- 
kled with salt and a little Cayenne, tlie juice 
of half a lemon is squeezed over it, and the 
Port wine is then poured all over. 

To roast a- wild goose, the same directions 
are followed as for wild duck, allowing 
more time to roast it, according to tlie size 
of the bird. 

Widgeons and teal are dressed in the 
same manner as the wild duck, and are 
roasted in ten minutes, and may be serrod 
upon fried bread crumbs. 

Woodcocks and snipes are roasted with* 
out bein<f drawn ; a piece of toasted bread 
buttered is put under each bird, to catch the 
trail; they are well booted with butter, and 
served upon the hot toast over which they 
were roasted ; a rich brown- gravy, or melt- 
ed butter, is poured round them. Wood- 



G A M

GAT 



cocks will require half an hour, snipes and 
quails fifteen or twenty minutes to roast. 

Ortolans and green plovers are not drawn, 
and are roasted and served in the same 
manner as woodcocks. f 

To roast larks, wheatears, and other 
small birds, tliey are nicely picked, gutted, 
cleaned, and trussed; brushed over with 
melted butter, and rolled in grated bread, 
then spitted on a bird spit, which is fastened 
upon a. larger one. They are basted with 
butter, and sprinkled with some bread 
crumbs. They will require nearly fifteen 
minutes to roast, and are served upon fried 
bread crumbs, and brown gravy in a sauce 
tureen. 

Wild pigeons may be roasted, or made 
into a pie. 

Plovers' eggs are boiled hard, and served 
in a napkin, or with green moss put round 
each in the dish. 

GAME, ESSENCE OF. Take four 
rabbits, four partridges, two pounds of veal, 
two pounds of steaks; put them into a 
stewpan, with a bottle of white wine; boil 
them until the whole is entirely reduced to 
a jelly ; then add to it broth, and consomme, 
(equal quantities of each), eight carrots, ten 
onions, three cloves, a little thyme and ba- 
sil; let the whole boil very gently, until the 
meat is quite done ; then strain it through a 
napkin. No salt need be put into it, as the 
broth and consomme are sufficiently season- 
ed to flavor the essence of game. 

GAME FRITTERS. Take any of 
those parts of cold roasted game, which can 
be cut into thin slices, dip them into good 
batter, and fry them in olive oil, or lard. 
Sprinkle the fritters when done, with salt 
and spices, pounded very fine. 

GAME HASHED. See Fowl. 

GARLIC BUTTER SAUCE. Pound 
half a dozen cloves of garlic; rub them 
through a silk sieve, with a wooden spoon ; 
put this into a mortar with some butter, and 
beat it until thoroughly incorporated; then 
put this butter into any sauce you please. 

GARLIC, ESSENCE OF. Take an 

earthen skillet, place it on the fire, and put 
into it a bottle of white wine, half a glass of 
vinegar, the juice of two lemons, six cloves 
of garlic, the same number of cloves, the 
quarter of a nutmeg, and two bay-leaves: 
when near boiling, reduce the fire, and let it 
stand on hot ashes for seven or eight hours ; 
strain it through a coarse sieve, and then 
filter it. Keep it in very closely corked 
bottles. A very small quantity ot this es- 
sence is requisite to impart its flavor to a dish. 



GARLIC GRAVY. Slice a pound and 
a h.ilf nf veal, or U (('; season it with j)op- 
|>er and salt; put it into a stewpan, with 
two carrots split, and four dines of Bailie 
sliced, a quarter of a pound of sliced ham, 
and a large spoonful of water; put the stew- 
pan over a gentle fire, ant) watch when the 
meat begins to stick to the pan; when it 
does, turn it, and let it U' very well browned, 
(but take care that it is not in the least 
burnt) ; then dredge it with flour, and pour 
in a quart of broth, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
a couple of cloves bnii>ed, and slice in a 
lemon; set it on the fire again, then let it 
simmer gently for an hour and a half longer; 
then skim oft' the fat, and strain off the gra- 
vy, by pouring it through a napkin, strain- 
ing and pressing it very hard. 

GATEAU DE COMPIEGXE. Take 

three pounds of flour, two pounds of butter, 
an ounce and four drachms of yeast, an 
ounce of silt, a quarter of a pound of sugar, 
a glass of cream, twelve yolks and twelve 
whole eggs, and five or six spoonfuls of 
whipped cream. 

With these ingredients proceed as follows: 
sift the flour, of which put a fourth part on 
the slab, make a hole in the middle, put into 
it a glass of warm water and the \east ; mix 
them together as lightly, and with as much 
despatch as possible, adding more warm 
water if necessary ; when well worked up 
for some minutes, gather it together, (it 
ought to leave the slab and the hand lively) , 
put it into a saucepan ; cover it, and place 
it in a tolerably warm situation to rise. 
Take the rest of the flour, lay it on the slab 
make a hole in the middle of it, in which 
put the salt, sugar, and cream ; stir these 
together well, and then put in the eggs, one 
at a time, (break them into a basin, incase 
all should not be good) ; the eg^s lx?ing put 
in, add by decrees the butter, stirring them 
well; then mix the flour, a little at a time, 
with the alxivc, until the wholo is formed 
into a smooth paste; more ei^s must be 
added if it be too stiff; work it up a little, 
and then add the leaven ; work that in; and 
lastly, put in the whipped cream. The 
whole operation being thus [x-rfonned, have 
ready a cylindrical fluted mould, (about 
eight inches in diameter, and nine in height) ; 
butter it by means of a gponge, being care- 
fill that it is done in all parts, otherwise the 
gateau will adhere to it ; place the mould 
in a moderately warm place, but wtere 
there is a free current of air. When the ga- 
teau has risen so as to fill the mould, and 
the surface is a little inflated, it should be 
put into the oven instantly, if not, it falls and 
becomes heavy. The oven must be of a 
moderate heat, and kept closed while the 
gateau is baking ; take it out in about an 



GHE 



85 



hour, and if it be flexible and light colored, 
replace it for thirty or forty minutes; but 
if, on die contrary, it is red, and firm to the 
touch, place a tin plate on the top, and put 
it in the oven till dune; reiimxe the mould 
with care, and the gateau is lini-'ued. If 
die mould does not come away quite so well 
as it ought, strike it gently with a spatula. 
When taken out, put it in the oven for a few 
minutes tu dry. 

This gateau is sometimes varied by the 
addition of six omi'-es of sugared anise, and 
the same quantity of dry currants. 

GATEAU DE POMMES. Boil in a 
pint of water one pound and a half of loaf 
sugar till it become a rich sirup ; weigh

ange, lemon, citron, and candied ginger, 
each four ounces, all thinly sliced ; one ounce 
of coriander-seeds, one ounce of canlways, 
and one ounce of beaten ginger, in as much 
paste as will make a soft paste; lay it in 
cakes or tin plates, and bake it in a quick 
ox in. Keep it dry in a covered earthen 
vessel, and it will be good for some months.

twelve ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a quar- 
ter of a pound of fresh batter, one pound of 
dried flour, two ounces of pounded ginger, 
and of cloves and cinnamon a quarter of an 
ounce each. Mix the ginger and the spice 
with the .flour; put the sugar and a small 
tea-cupful of water into a saucepan ; when 
it is dissolved, add the butter, and as soon 
as it is melted, mix it with the flour and 
other things; work it up, and form the 
paste into cakes or nuts, and bake them 
upon tins. 

GINGERBREAD, LAFAYETTE. 

Five eggs ; half a pound of brown sugar ; half 
a pound of fresh butter ; a pint of sugar-house 
molasses ; a pound and a half of flour ; four 
table-spoonfuls of ginger; two large sticks of 
cinnamon; three dozen grains of allspice; 
three dozen of cloves ; the juice and grated 
peel of two lemons. Stir the butter and su- 
gar to a cream ; beat the eggs very well ; 
pour the molasses at once, into the butter 
and sugar. Add the ginger and other spice, 
and stir all well together. Put in the egg 
and Hour alternately, stirring all the time. 
Stir the whole very hard, and put in the 
lemon at the last. When the whole is mix- 
ed, stir it till very light. Butter an earthen 
pan, or a thick tin or iron one, and put the 
gingerbread in it. Bake it in a moderate 
oven, an hour or more, according to its 
thickness. Take care that it do not burn. 
Or you may bake it in small cakes, or lit- 
tle tins. Its lightness will be much improv- 
ed by a small tea-spoonful of pear lash dis- 
solved in a lea-spoonful of vinegar, and stir- 
red lightly in at the last. Too much pearl- 
ash will give it an unpleasant taste. If you 
use pearlash, you must omit the lemon, as 
its taste will Ix; entirely destroyed by the 
pearlash. You may substitute for the lem- 
on some raisins and currants, well floured 
to prevent their sinking. 

GINGERBREAD NUTS. (1) Take four 

pounds of flour, half a pound of sifted sugar, 
an iiunct! of caraway-seeds, half an ounce 
of ginger pounded and sifted, six ounces of 
fresh butter, and two ounces of candied or- 
ange-peel cut into small slices ; then take a 
pound of treacle or honey, and a gill of 
cream, make them warm together; mix it, 
with all the ingredients, into a paste, and j 
let it lay six hours; then roll it out, make it 
into nuts, and kike them in a moderate oven. 

GINGERBREAD NUTS. (2) Take 
one pound of dried and sifted flour, one 
pound of treacle, three ounces of brown su- 
gar, four ounces of fresh butter, one ounce 
and a half of pounded and sifted giner, <>f 
candied orange-peel and citron, cut small, 
three-quarters of an ounce each ; melt the 



butter with the treacle, and when it is about 
milk-wann, add it to the flour and other 
ingredients, and then mix all well together; 
with a spoon drop the nuts upon buttered 
tins, and bake them. 

GINGERBREAD NUTS. (3) Dis- 
solve a quarter of a pound of butter in three- 
quarters of a pound of treacle, put it into a 
pan large enough to contain the rest of the 
ingredients, and when almost cold, stir in 
one pound of dried and sifted flour, half a 
pound of coarse brown sugar, half an ounce 
of caraway seeds, three-quarters of an ounce 
of pounded ginger, and the grated peel of a 
lemon ; mix all these well together, and let 
it stand till it be stiff, or till the following 
day, then make it into nuts, by pinching it 
into pieces with the finger and thumb. 
Bake them upon buttered tins in a quick 
oven. Half an ounce of coriander seeds 
may be added. 

GINGERBREAD NUTS. (4) Rub 
half a pound of butter into two pounds of 
flour; add one pound of coarse sugar, and 
one ounce of pounded ginger; mix all well 
together with one pound and two ounces of 
treacle; form it into nuts, or roll it out, and 
cut it into round cakes; bake them upon 
tins. 

GINGERBREAD, OATMEAL. Sift 
four pounds of oatmeal, and mix with it four 
pounds of treacle, half a pound of brown su- 
gar, tlie same quantity of melted butter, and 
three-quarters of an ounce of powdered gin- 
ger. Work it all well together, let it re- 
main for twenty-four hours, and then make 
it into cakes. 

GINGER BEER. See Beer. 

GINGER CAKES. Put four pounds of 
flour upon the dresser; then take a copper 
saucepan, and break into it six eggs, and 
mix them well with a spoon; add one pint 
of cream to them, and beat them well; put 
the saucepan over the fire, stir till your mix- 
ture is warm ; put two pounds of butter into 
the cream and eggs, and one pound of sugar, 
and keep stirring it over a very slow fire, 
just to melt all the butler; put in four ounces 
of pounded ginger, and as soon as all the 
butter is melted, pour it all into the middle 
of the flour; mix it as well as you possibly 
can, till it becomes a fine paste; then roll it 
out with flour under it on your dresser; cut 
them to the size of the top of a tea-cup, a 
quarter of an inch in thickness; and before 
you put them into die oven (which should be 
very hot), place three papers under them.

lemons. 

GLACE, ROYAL. Put the white of a 
new-laid egg into a pan, and mix with it a 
sufficient quantity of white powder-sugar to 
make a glace or icing, neither too dry nor 
too liquid; beat it well, and add a little 
lemon-juice to whiten it. By mixing with

GLAZE. (1) Take the remains of 
any liquor in which meat has been cooked, 
and .-train it through a silk sieve until quite 
clear; then put it into a saucepan and re- 
duce it over a brisk fire: as soon as it is 
sufficiently done, that is, when it sticks to 
the spoon, put it into a smaller saucepan, 
and set it in the bain-marie; when wanted, 
add a small piece of fresh butter to it, to 
correct iln saJtness. 

GLAZE. (2) Make a consomme with 
whatever remnants of fowls or meat that may 
be in the home; strain it, and then put it on 
the lire with two or three whites of eggs 
beaten to a snow; stir till it boils, and then 
set on tin- side of the stove, and place fire 
on the saucepan lid ; as soon as the eggs are 
set, (KISS the glaze through a wet cloth ; re- 
duce this OUT a lari, r i' lire, stirring it con-

to a sanri-|>an, and make it hot over a slow 
fire; and, in this state, lay it gently over 
such articles as may require glazing, In' 
means of a feather. 

(il.A/K. (3) Desire the butcher to break 
the Ixines of a leg or a shin of Iwef, of ten 
pounds weight (tin; fresher killed the better) ; 
put it into a s<Hip-|x>t (a digester is the best 
nten-il lor (his |>irjx.se) that will well hold

on the fire to heat gradually till it nearly 



boils (this should U- at least an hour); skim 
it attentnely while any scum rises; |xmr in 
a little cold water, to throw up the scum 
that may remain ; let it come to a boil again, 
and again skim it carefully: when no more 
scum rises, and the broth appears clear (put 
ill neither roots, nor ln-rlis, nor salt), let it 
boil {or eight or ten hours, and then strain 
it through a hair sieve into a l>ro\\n stone 
pan ; set tlie broth where it will cool quicklv ; 
put the meat into a sieve, let it drain, make 
potted beef, or it will be very acceptable to 
many poor families. Next day remove 
every particle of fat from the top of it, and 
pour it through a tamis, or fine sieve, as 
quietly as possible, into a stewpan, taking 
care not to let any of the settlings at the 
bottom of the stone pan go into the stewpan, 
which should be of thick copper, perfectly 
well tinned ; add a quarter of an ounce of 
whole black |x-p|r to it; let it boil briskly, 
with the stewpan uncovered, on a quick 
fire ; if any scum rises, take it off with a 
skimmer : when it begins to thicken, and is 
reduced to about a quart, put it into a smal- 
ler stewpan ; set it over a gentler fire, till k 
is reduced. 

GODIVEAU. Take fillet of veal or 
breasts of fowl or game, fresh pork or 
sausage meat, beef-marrow or suet, equal 
quantities of each, veal sweetbreads, truf- 
fles, and mushrooms; season these articles 
with pepper, cloves, and nutmeg, all in 
powder; pound them all together, and 
put in (one at a time) the yolks of eggs; 
pour in also a little water, pounding con- 
tinually, until it is reduced to a sort of paste. 
Make a small ball of it, which Ixiil in a 
little water to ascertain wliethcr it lie suf- 
ficiently salt; sweet lierbs may be added 
when you are about to use it. Tlie gottiveau 
is used as a farce for lourles and hot pie*. 

GOOSE, TO CHOOSE. Be careful 
in choosing a goose, that tlie bill and feet 
are yellow, as it will be young: when old 
the feet and bill are red. When they are 
fresh the feet are pliable; if stale they are 
dry and stiff. Green geese are in < 
from May or June, till they are three montltt 
old; they should Ix' scalded. A stubble 
gootte is good till it is five or six months 
old, and should be picked dry. 

GOOSE ROASTED. A stubble goose 

should lie smiled with sage and onions, 
chopped small, and mixed with |icp|>er and 
salt ; boil the sage and onion in a little w- 
ter before they are chopped, or mix a few 
bread cmmlis with them wlien cho|>ped ; 
either will render them less strong. 1'ut it 
fir.-t at a distaee iVom tlie fire, and by de- 
grees draw it nearer. A slip of paper

should be skewered on the breast bone. 
Baste it very well. When the breast is 
rising, take off the paper, and be careful to 
serve it before die breast falls, it will be 
spoiled by coming to table flattened. Serve 
it with good gravy and apple sauce, in 
boats. It will take about an hour and a 
half to roast. 

GOOSE TO TRUSS. The goose must 
be first well picked and stubbed, then cut 
off the pinions at the first joint, and the 
feet also. Make a slit in the liack of the 
neck, and take out the throat, cut off die 
neck close to the l>aek and the skin, but 
leave enough to turn over the back ; make a 
slit between the vent and the rump, through 
which draw out the entrails, then wipe it 
clean. Draw the legs up, keeping them 
close to the side, then put a skewer into 
die wing, through the middle of the leg, 
body, and die leg and wing on die odier 
side ; put another skewer dirough the small 
of the leg, which keep close to die sidesmen ; 
nm it dirough, and do the same on die oth- 
er side. Cut through die end of die vent, 
dirough which put die rump, to prevent the 
stuffing from falling out. 

GOOSEBERRY CREAM. Boil one 
quart of gooseberries very quick, in as much 
water as will covet diem: stir in about half 
an ounce of good butter; when they are 
soft, pulp them dirough a sieve; sweeten 
die pulp while it is hot, with sugar, dien 
beat it up widi die yolks of four eggs ; serve 
in a dish, cups, or glasses. 

GOOSEBERRY FOOL. Put goose- 
berries into a stone jar, with some fine su- 
gar; put the jar either in a stove, or in a 
saucepan of water, over the fire; if in a 
stove, a large spoonful of water should be 
added to the fruit. When it is done to pulp, 
press it through a colander ; have ready a 
sufficient quantity of new milk, and a tea- 
cupful of raw cream', boiled togedier, or 
you may use an egg instead of the cream ; 
leave it to get cold, then sweeten well with 
fine sugar, and mix die pulp by degrees 
with it. 

GOOSEBERRY MARMALADE. Boil 
diem a moment, or only scald them in boil- 
ing water, sift diem dirough a sieve ; reduce 
them ova- die fire to half, then mix diem 
with sugar prepared to the nindi degree (a 
la grande plume), half a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM. See Jam. 

GOOSEBERRY PASTE. Gather, 
when quite ripe, die rough red gooseberries ; 



top and tail them ; put them into a jar, tie 
it over with bladder, and boil it in a pot 
of water till the fruit lie perfectly soft; pour 
off the thin juice, and with a wooden s|K>on 
nib the Kooeeberriea through a fine hair 
sis \e ; allow rather more than half the 
weight of the pulp of pounded loaf sugar, 
mix it together, and boil it till it will jelly, 
which will take almost two hours; stir, and 
skim it, then put it into a dish, and serve 
when cold, to be eaten with cream. The 
thin juice may be Ixjiled with its weight x of 
good brown sugar, and used as gooseberry 
jelly. 

GOURDS FRIED. (1) Cut five or six 
gourds in quarters; take off die skin and 
pulp; stew them in the same manner as for 
table: when done, drain them quite dry; 
beat up an egg, and dip the gourds in it, 
and cover diem well over with bread-numbs ; 
make some hog's-lard hot, and fry them a 
nice light color; dirow a little salt and 
pepper over them, and serve up quite dry. 

GOURDS FRIED. (2) Take six or 

eight small gourds, as near of a size as pos- 
sible ; slice them widi a cucumber-ehce; 
dry them in a cloth, and then fry them in 
very hot lard; throw over a little pepper and 
salt, and serve up on a napkin. Great at- 
tention is requisite to do diese well ; if the 
fat is quite hot diey are done in a minute, 
and will soon spoil ; if not hot enough, diey 
will eat greasy and tough. 

GOURDS STEWED. Take off all 

the skin of six or eight gourds, put them in- 
to a stewpan, widi water, saU, lemon-juice, 
and a bit of butter, or fat bacon, and let 
them stew gently till quite tender, and serve 
up with a rich Dutch sauce, or any odier 
sauce you please dial is piquante.

give diem a boil two or three tin. 
then place them in a dessert diMi: if there is- 
any scum IIJKJII them, carefully wi|>e it off

GRAPES, PICKLED. The ra|x* 
must be at dieir full growth, but not ripe, 
cut diem in small bunches ; put them in a 
stone jar, with vine leave.- Ix-tween each 
layer of grapes, till the jar is full; then take 
as much spring-water as will cover the 
grapes and die leaves ; as it heats put in ;is 
much salt ag will make a brine sufficiently 
strong to l>ear an egg ; you must use half 
bay salt and half common salt; when it

GRAVIES, DIRECTIONS RESPECT- 
ING. The skirts of beef and the kidney, 
will make quite as good gravy as any other 
meat . it' prepared in the same manner. 

The kidney <>f an ox, or the milt, makes 

excellent gravy, cut all to pieces, and pre- 

ther meat; and so will the shank 

end of mutton that has been dressed, if much 

gravy is not required. 

Tiie shank-bones of mutton add greatly to 
the richness of gravy; hut they should be 
first w.-ll soaked, and scoured clean. 

To ohtain the flavor of French cookery, 
and to improve tlie taste of the gravies, tar- 
s' 



ragoo should be used; but it must not be 
added till a short time before serving. 

GRAVY. (1) Take three pounds of beef 
steaks, two rabbits, (excepting the head* 
and breasts), a knuckle of veal, five carrots, 
>i\ onions, two cloves, two bay leaves, a 
hunch of par.- ley and scallious ; put all these 
into a stewpan, with two ladlesful of broth, 
and set tliem over a good fire to reduce; 
then cover the stove, and let the stewpan 
stand over it, until the meat begins to give 
out tlie gravy, and adheres slightly ; the jel- 
ly at the liotiom of the stewpan ought to be 
nearly black, and when that is the case, 
take it from the stove, and let it stand for 
ten minutes; then fill up the stewpan with 
good broth, or water, (if the latter, not so 
large a quantity) ; let this simmer for thre* 
hours; skim and season it well. If water 
is used instead of broth, the gravy must lie 
strained before it is used. Gravy may also 
be made of any pieces of ready dressed 
meat, in die following manner: cut some 
onions into slices, lay them at the bottom of 
the stewpan, and the meat on them, with 
the game ingredients as above, and two or 
three glasses of water; then proceed in the 
same manner as the other, until the bottom 
of the stewpan is nearly black, when add 
water according to die quantity of meat; 
(Hit salt if necessary, and simmer the whole 
for two hours; then strain it through a 
sieve. 

GRAVY. (2) Cut down into slices four 
pounds of lean beef, rub the bottom of the 
pot with Initter, and put in the- meat ; turn it 
frequently till it Ix' well browned, and do it 
slowly, tiieu add four quirts of cold water; 
when it lias boiled two hours, put in two 
dessert-spoonfuls of whole pepper, one car- 
rot, and three onions; let it stew gently for 
four hours longer, strain it, and when it in 
required tor use, take off the fat. This gra- 
vy answer* for all made dishes when brown 
gravy sauce is used. 

GRAVY AND STUFFING FOR 
DUCKS. Boil all the giblets excepting tht 
liver for an hour in a pint of water with a 
chopped on ion, some salt and pepper; strain, 
and add a very little browning, with a tea- 
spoonful of coratch, and one of mushroom 
ketchup; for the stuffing, mince the raw 
liver with two sage leaves, a small onion, 
some pepper and salt, a bit of butter, and 
grated bread crumbs. 

Send your sauces to table as hot as po- 
sible. 

Nothing can be more unsightly than the 
surface of a sauce in a frozen state, or gar- 
nished with grease on the top. Tlie best 
way to get rid of this, Is to pass it through 



GRA

4 tatnis or napkin previous!}' soaked in cold 
water; the coldness of the napkin will coag- 
ulate the fat, and only suffer the pure gravy 
to pass through: if any particles of fat re- 
main, take them off by applying filtering pa- 
per, as blotting paper is applied to writing. 
Let your sauces boil up after you put in 
wine, anchovy, or thickening, that their fla- 
vors may be well blended with the other in- 
gredients; and keep in mind that the 
top- knot of COOKERY is, to entertain the 
mouth without offending the stomach. 

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. It is of 
as much importance that the cook should 
know how to make a boat of good gravy for 
poultry, &c. as that it should be sent up of 
proper complexion, and nicely frothed. 

We shall endeavor to introduce to her all 
the materials which give flavor in sauce 
which is the essence of soup, and intended j 
to contain more relish in a tea-spoonful 
than the former does in a table-spoonful. 

We hope to deserve as much praise from I 
the economist as we do from the ban vivant; 
as we have taken great pains to'introduce to 
him the methods of making substitutes for 
those ingredients, which are always expen- 
sive, and often not to be had at all. Many 
of these cheap articles are as savory and 
as salutary as the dearer ones, and those who 
have large families and limited incomes, will, 
no doubtj be glad to avail themselves of 
them. 

The reader may rest assured, that wheth- 
er he consults this book to diminish the ex- 
pense or increase the pleasures of hospitality, 
he will find all the information that was to 
be obtained up to 1832, communicated in 
the most unreserved and intelligible manner. 

A great deal of the elegance of cookery 
depends upon the accompaniments to each 
dish being appropriate and well adapted 
to it. 

We can assure our readers, no attention 
has been wanting on our part to render this 
department of the work worthy of their pe- 
rusal ; each receipt is the faithful narrative 
of actual and repeated experiments, and has 
received die most deliberate consideration 
before it was here presented to them. It is 
given in the most circumstantial manner, 
and not in the technical and mysterious lan- 
guage former writers on these subjects seem 
to have preferred ; by which their directions 
are useless and unintelligible to all who have 
not regularly served an apprenticeship at the 
stove. 

It will be to very little purpose that I 
have taken so much pains to teach how to 
manage roasts and boils, if a cook cannot or 
will not make the several sauces that are 
usually sent up with them. 

We have, therefore, endeavored to give 



tlie plainest directions how to produce, with 
the least trouble and ex|iense possible, all 
the unions compositions the English kitchen 
atlords; and lii>|K- to present such a whole- 
some and palatable variety as will suit all 
tastes and all |x>ckets, so that a cook may 
give satisfaction in all families. The more 
combinations of this sort she is acquainted 
with, the better she will comprehend tin; 
management of every one of them. 

Let your sauces each display a decided 
character; send up your plain sauces (oys- 
ter, lobster, &c.) as pure as |x>ssible: they 
should only taste of the materials from which 
they take their name. 

The imagination of most cooks is so in- 
cessantly on the hunt for a relish, that they 
seem to think they cannot make sauce snf'li- 
cii-ntlv .-avory without putting into it every- 
thing that ever was eaten; and supposing 
every addition must bean improvement, they 
frequently overpower the natural flavor of 
their PLAIN SAUCES, by overloading them 
with salt and spices, &c.: but, remember, 
these will be deteriorated by any addition, 
save only just salt enough to awaken the 
palate. 

On the contrary, of COMPOUND SAUCES ; 
the ingredients should be so nicely propor- 
tioned, that no one be predominant; so that 
from the equal union of the combined fla- 
vors such a fine mellow mixture is produced, 
whose very novelty cannot fail of being ac- 
ceptable to the persevering gourmand, if it 
lias not pretensions to a permanent place at 
his table. 

An ingenious cook will form as endless a 
variety of these compositions as a musician 
with his seven notes, or a painter with his 
colors; no part of her business oilers so fair 
and frequent an opportunity to display her 
abilities: SPICKS, HERBS, &c. are c.flen 
very absurdly and injudiciously jumbled to- 
gether. 

Why have clove and allspice, or mace and 
nutmeg, in the same sauce ; or marjoram, 
thyme, and savory; or onions, leeks, es- 
chalots, and garlic'! one will very well sup- 
ply the place of the other, and the frugal 
cook may save something considerable l>? 
attending to this, to the advantage of her 
employers, and her own time and trouble.

ham-bone, pound them, break the bone, and 
put all into a saucepan, together with nearly 
half a pint of water, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs; simmer gently for sometime, stirring 
it occasionally ; then add a pint of gocd beef 
gravy, and some pepper, and continue to

GRAVV FOR BOILED MEAT, .May 

be made with (tarings and Irimmin 1 .;*; nr 
pour fnini :i quarter to half a jiint of the li- 
quor in which the meat was Ixiiled, into tlie 
tii.-h willi it, and pierce the inferior jxirt of 
Uie joint with a sharp skewer. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT. (1) 

Most joint* will afford sufficient trimmings, 
&.<. to make half a pint of plain jjravy, which 
you may color with a few drops of In-owning: 
for those that do not, about half an hour be- 
fore you think the meat will Itc done, mix a 
salt->|xioiifnl of <alt, with a lull quarter-put 

of Ixiiliug water; drop this by degrees on 
the brown parts of the joint; set a dish un- 
der to catch it (the meat will soon brown 
a<;aiii); srt it li\ ; as it cools, the fat will 
float on thr sin lace; when tlie meat is ready, 
carefully remove the fat, and warm up the 
gravy, a.i.l |x>nr it into the dish. 

The common method is, when the meal 
is in the ii:>!i yon intend to .-mi! it up in, 
to mix half a tca-s|x>onful of salt Ji a quarter 
pint of boiling walur, and to drop some of 
this ovi-i tin- corners and underside of tlie 
meat, and to pour i he rest through the hole 
\he spit came out of: some pierce the infe- 
rior parts of the joints with a sharp skewer. 

The following receipt was given us by a 
very ood COOK: You may make good 
brnwnia:: lor roast meat and poultry-, by 
saving the brown bits of roast meat or broil- 
ed ; cm them small, put tliem into a basin, 
cover them with boiling water, and put them 
away till next day ; tlwn put il into a sauoe- 
jian. let it boil two or three inimili--. -tiain 
it tliroiiu'h a sieve into a basin, and put it 
use. When you want gravy for 
roast meat, put two tahle-|K>onfnls into half 
a pint of Ixn'ling water with a little sail: if 
for rousted veal, put three tahlc-Kpooniul* 
into half a pint of thin melted butter. 

The gravy which comes down in the dish, 
tlie cook (if she is a good hoii>ewife) will 
prir-eive to enrich hashes or little made 
dislie- , xi . 

(iUAVV FOR ROAST MEAT. (2) 

About a ijnartrr of :ui hour before llie meat

with a tea-sjxxmnil of salt in it under the 
meal; when it lias all run into the di.-li, re- 
move il, baste and froth the meat, and pour 
the gravy into the dish on which tlie roast is

water, and after it boils, let it simmer for 
nearly tluree hours : boil with it a couple of 
onions, a Inim-h of sweet herbs, some salt 
and pepper; strain, and keep it for making 
gravy or sauces. Tile bones of broiled and 
roasted meat being scraped, washed clean, 
and Ixiiled in lees water, answer equally well

GRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT. 

(1) Slice three onions, and fry them brown 
in a little butter; add them to half a pint 
of water, and tlie same of .beer, put in some 
peppercorns, salt, a little lemon peel, three 
cloves, a little mace or pepper, a spoonful 
of wall ml pickle, and one of mushroom 
ketchup, of soy and essence of anchovy a 
dessert-spoonful each, a small bunch of sweet 
herbs, and a quarter of a slice of bread 
toasted brown on bodi sides; simmer all to- 
gether in a closely covered saucepan for 
twenty minutes, then strain it for use, and 
when cold take off the fat. It w ill taste 
exactly like a gravy made with meat. 

GRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT. 

(2) Knead a good deal of flour into a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, fry it in a fry- 
ing-pan over a clear fire, stir it constantly 
with a wooden spoon till it become a nice 
brown color, taking particular care that it 
lie made perfectly smooth; pour in some 
boiling water, add a little finely-minced on- 
ion, some whole pepper and a little salt, put 
it into a small saucepan, cover it closely, 
and simmer it for a short time ; strain, and 
mix with it a little mushroom ketchup, and 
IWt wine. 

GRAVY OR Rial CULLIS. Cut 

into slices gome lean beef, veal, and mutton, 
cover the ItoHoiu of die saucepan with the 
veal, then put in a few slices of salt pork, 
next a lav er of l>eef, add a few onions sliced, 
and the red |>art of one or two carrots, u 
little mace, two or three cloves, some whole 
pepper, and two or three bay-leaves, above 
that the mutton; cover tlie pan closely, MJ| it 
on a slow (ire, and when the meat is a fin* 
brown, mix quite smooth a small quantity 
of Hour in water, stir it in, and then add an 
much Ixiiling water as will cover the inc::t 
well, and a little salt ; cover tlie pan closely, 
and let it stew an hour and a half; strain, 
and keep it for use; it will continue good for 
eight or ten days. 

GRAVY DRAWN. Put a few pound, 
of gravy-beef sliced, and a liltle whole- 
pepper, into ajar with a cover to til closely; 
set the jar into a pot of cold water, and wheu 
it Ixiils, add ;ir il wastes more hot wa!.-i, 
and keep it boiling gently for six 
hours, when the richest gravy in. 



OR A 



HAM 



will be obtained. It may be used in that 
state, or reduced with water. 

GRAVY, TO MAKE A PINT OF 
RICH. Brown a quarter of a |x>n>iil of 
butter, dredging in two lable-spoonfuls of 
flour, and stirring it constantly; add a pound 
of yr.ivy-beef cut into small bits, and two or 
three onions chopped. When it becomes 
brown, add some whole pepper, one carrot, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, and three pints of 
water ; let it boil gently till reduced to one, 
then strain it. This gravy may be served 
with roasted turkey or fowl. 

GRAVY, TO CLARIFY. Clarify gra- 
vy, drawn from beef or veal, with the beaten 
whites of eggs, allowing one white to a 
quart. Gravies and soups which are to be 
clarified should be made very strong, and be 
highly seasoned. 

GRAVY AND SAUCE INGREDI- 
ENTS. Browning for made dishes. Put into 
a saucepan one pound of good brown sugar, 
stir it constantly over a slow fire, boil it 
till it is as thick as treacle, and resembles 
it in color; take the pan off the fire, stir it 
for a minute or two, and pour in very slowlv 
a quart of boiling water, stirring constantly ; 
put it again on the fire, and boil it for a 
little; pour it into a bowl, and when cold, 
bottle it. This browning will keep good 
for a year, and very little of it serves for 
coloring soups, gravies, or sauces. 

To clarify butter. Put the butter cut into 
slices into a nicely-cleaned brass pan, stir it 
gently till dissolved: when it boils, draw the 
pan to the side of the fire, skim it, and let 
it boil gently a second time, and if any scum 
again rises, take it off; let it settle for two 
or three minutes, and strain it gently through 
a sieve which has a piece of muslin laid 
into it. 

Fresh beef suet, picked free from skin 
and sinews, is dissolved in the same way; 
it is then strained through muslin into small 
jars, and when cold, covered with bladder, 
or it may be strained into cold water ; and 
tin; cake when cold, wiped dry, folded in 
white paper, and kept in a linen bag. 

Beef suet will keep fresh for sometime 
if finely chopped and dredged with flour, 
and kept in white paper bags in a cool place. 

Beef and mutton drippings are clarified 
exactly in the manner butter is done, and 
each kept in a separate jar. 

To melt hog's-lard, put it into a jar plac- 
ed in a pot of water or water bath, strain it 
into clean bladders or small jars, and cover 
them wilh paper. Thus prepared, it will 
keep good a length of time, and is the best 
tiling for fiying fish in. 

To fry parsley, wash it, pick it clean, 



and put it into fresh cold water; take it out 
and then throw it into boiling lard or drip- 
ping, when it will instantly become crisp; 
it is then taken out with a slice. 

GRUEL. DR. KITCHENER'S. Ask 

those who are to eat it, if they like it 
thick or thin; if the latter, mix well togeth- 
er by degrees, in a pint basin, one table- 
spoonful of oatmeal, with three of cold wa- 
ter; if the former, use two spoonfuls. 

Have ready in a steupan, a pint of boil- 
ing water or milk ; pour this by degrees to i 
the oatmeal you have mixed ; return it into 
the stewpan ; set it on the fire, and let it 
boil for five minutes; stirring it all the time 
to prevent the oatmeal from burning at tlie 
Ixrtioin of the stewpan ; skim and strain it 
through a hair sieve. 

2d. To convert this into caudle, add a 
little ale, wine, or brandy, with sugar; and 
if the bowels are disordered, a little nutmeg 
or ginger, grated. 

4Jbs. Gruel may be made with broth in- 
stead cf water; and may be flavored with 
sweet hoilis, soup roots, and savory spices, 
by boiling them for a few minutes in the 
water you are going to make the gruel with. 



H. 

HAM. If it is a very dry Westphalia 
ham, it must be soaked, according to its age 
and thickness, from twelve to twenty-four 
hours ; for a green ham, from four to eight 
hours will Insufficient. Lukewarm water will 
soften it much sooner than cold, when suffi- 
ciently soaked, trim it nicely on the under- 
side, and pare off all the rusty ami smoked 
parts till it looks delicately clean. 

Give it plenty of water-room, and put it 
in while the water is cold; let it heat very 
gradually, and let it l)e on the fire an hour 
and a half before it comes to a boil; let it 
be well skimmed, and keep it simmering 
very gently: a middling-sized ham of fifteen 
pounds will be done enough in about four or 
five hours, according to its thickness. 

If not to be cut till cold, it will cut the 
shorter and tenderer for being boiled ubout 
half an hour longer. In a very small family, 
where a ham will last a week or ten days, 
it is best economy not to cut it till it is cold, 
it will be infinitely more juicy. 

Pull off the skin carefully, and preserve it 
as whole as possible; it will fonn an excel- 
lent covering to keep the ham moist; lien 
you have removed the skin, nib some bread 
raspings through a hair sieve, or grate a 
crust of bread; put it into the perforated 
cover of tlie dredging-lwx, and shake it over

ness) in the usual manner. 

HAM, OR TONGUE POTTED. Cut 

a pound of the lean of cold boiled ham or 
tongue, and pound it in a mortar with a 
quarter of a pound of the fat, or with fresh 
butter (in the proportion of about two ounces 
to a. |xmnd). till it is a line paste (some sea- 
sou it by degrees with a little pounded mace 
or allspice) : put it close down in pots for 
that purpose, and cover it with clarified 
butter, a quarter of an inch thick; let it 
stand one night in a cool place. Send it 
up in the pot, or cut out in thin slices. 

HAM ROASTED WITH MADEIRA.* 
Take a fine Westphalia or Hayonne ham, 
pare and trim it of as round a form its possi- 
ble, take off the end bone, and remove 
the rind from the knuckle; then lay the ham 
on a gridiron over the lire, till you can take 
it up with ease; soak it, if neccs,:u v, and 
put it in a pan, with slices of carrots and 
onions, tin me, bay-leaf, and coriander; pour 
a bottle of Madeira ti|>on it, cover it with a 
clean cloth, and close the pan as tight as 
possible, and let it remain twenty-four hours; 
then wrap the liam in very thick (viper, fas- 
ten it with paste, so that it may be com- 
pletely enclosed, tie it on a spit, and put 
it to roast for three hours; tlien make a 
small hole in the paper, and pour in, by 
means of a funnel, {lie .Madeira wine, paste 
paper over the hole, and let it roast anotlier 
hour. When done, take off the paper care- 
: it none of the gravy may escape, 
mix it with some reduced espagnole, glaze 
the ham, and serve it. 

HAM TOAST. Cut some crumb of 
bread into thin slices; then take- an equal

over them. Take particular care to cot 
die ham as nearly as possible die size and 
shape of die bread. 

HAM TO STEW. Soak die ham in 

lukewarm water tor twelve hours, drain it, 
Aid scrape die rind ; put it into a stewpan

94 



H AR 



parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs, six large 
onions, four carrots, a little allspice :uul 
pep|)er, a pint of Madeira, and one of Port 
wine. Cover the ham with slices of fat ba- 
con, and put over it a sheet of white paper; 
stew it eight hours, or ten if it IK: a very 
large ham. Before serving, take off the 
rind, strain the sauce, skim it well, and 
boil it till reduced to a glaze, and pour it 
round the ham, or serve it with any other 
sauce tliat may be preferred. 

HAM WITH MADEIRA. Soak in

which, with the ham, must be served quite 
hot. 

HARE. As soon as the cook receives a 
hare, she should take out the liver, &c., wipe 
it well, put in a little pepper, and hang it 
up. When wanted for dressing, cut off 
the four legs at the first joint, raise the 
skin of the back, and draw it over the 
hind legs ; leave the tail whole, then draw 
the skin over the back, and slip out the four 
legs; cut it from the neck and head; skin 
the ears, and leave them on. Clean the 
vent. Cut the sinews under the hind legs ; 
bring them forward ; run a skewer through 
one hind leg, the body, and another hind 
leg; do the same with die fore legs; lay the 
head rather back ; put a skewer in at the 
mouth, through the back of the -head and 
between the shoulders ; put in the stuffing, 
and tie it round with a string, passing it 
over the legs to keep them in their places: 
the hare is then ready for roasting. See 
Hare Roasted. 

HARE, JUGGED. Having skinned a 
hare, cut off the shoulders and legs, and di- 
vide the back into three pieces; nib them 
well with fat bacon, and put them into a 
stewpan with the trimmings, allspice, mace, 
whole pepper, a small clove of garlic, two 
bay-leaves, three onions, parsley, thyme, 
sweet marjoram, a quart of veal stock, and 
three gills of Port wine; simmer die whole 
till three parts done ; then take out the shoul- 
ders, legs, and back ; put them into another 
stewpan, strain (lie liquor to them, add a 
little flour and butter, stew them till quite 
done; take off the fat, season widi cayenne, 
valt, and lemon-juice, and serve die whole 
in a deep dish. 

HARE ROASTED. Cut die skin from 



a hare that has been well soaked ; put it on 
the spit and rub it well with Madeira, prick- 
ing it in various places that it may iinlulie 
plenty of wine; cover it entirely with a 
]iaste, and roast it. When done, take away 
the paste, rub it quickly over with egg, 
sprinkle bread-cminbs, and baste it gently 
with butter (still keeping it turning before 
the fire) until a mist is formed o\cr it and 
it is of a nice brown color; dish it over 
some espagitole with Madeira wine boiled 
in it ; two or three cloves may be stuck into 
the knuckles if you think proper. 

HASHED HARE. Cut up the hare 
into pieces fit to help at table, and divide 
die joints of die legs and shoulders, and set 
them by ready. Put the trimmings and 
gravy you have left, with half a pint of wa- 
ter (there should be a pint of liquor), and a 
table-spoon fill of currant jelly, into a clean 
stewpan, and let it boil gently for a quarter 
of an hour: dien strain it through a sieve 
into a basin, and pour it back into the stew- 
pan; now flour the hare, put it into die 
gravy, and let it simmer very gently till die 
hare is warm (about twenty minutes) ; cut 
the stuffing into slices, and put it into die 
hash to get warm, about five minutes before 
you serve it; divide the head, and lay one 
half on each side the dish. 



HARICOT BY WAY OF SOUP. 

Cut a large neck of mutton into two pieces, 
put die scrag into a Mew pan with a quart 
of water, four large carrots, and turnips; 
boil it gently over a slow fire till nil the 
goodness be out of die meat; then bruise 
die vegetables into die soup to diicken it. 
Fry six onions (sliced) in butler, and put 
die other part of die meat to the soup, and 
stew till the latter is tender; season with 
pepper and salt, and serve it very hot in a 
tureen. 

HARICOT MUTTON. Cut die best 
end of a neck or loin of mutton, that 
has been kept till tender, into chops of 
equal thickness, one rib to each ; trim off 
some of the fat, and die lower end of the 
chine bone, and scrape it clean, and lay 
them in a stewpan, with an ounce of butter; 
set it o\er a smart fire; if your fire is not 
sharp, the chops will be done before they 
are colored; die intention of frying them 19 
merely to give them a very light browning. 

While die chops are browning, jx.t-1 and 
boil a couple of dozen of young button onions 
in about diree pints of water for about fifteen 
or twenty minutes, set them by, and pour off 
the liquor they were boiled in into the stew- 
pan with die chops: if that is not sufficient 
to cover diem, add as much boiling water a* 
will remove die .-cum as it rises, and be

of blanched almonds, cut lengthwise, into 
slips, and place it in a dish ; beat up the 
yolks of four eggs, put them to a pint of 
cream (sweetened to the taste) ; stir them 
over a slow fire till hot, then pour it round 
the hedgehog and let it stand; when cold, 
serve it. A good calf's-foot jelly may be 
poured round, instead of the cream, if pre- 
ferred. 

HERBS, A BUNCH OF SWEET, Is 

made up of parsley, sweet marjoram, winter 
savory, orange and lemon thyme ; the great-

HERBS, SWEET. These in cookery 
are parsley, chil>hol, rocambole, winter sa- 
vory, thyme, Ixu-leal", liasil, mint, borage, 
rosemary, cress, marigold, marjoram, &c. 
The relishing licrlis or Ravigotte are tar- 
ragon, garden-cress, cliervil, buniet, civet, 
and green mustard. 

HERBS TO DRY, SWEET AND

the greater part of die crop of each species 
is ripe. 

Take care they are gathered on a dry 
day, by which means they will have a bet- 
ter color when dried. Cleanse your herbs 
well from dirt and dust ; cut off the roots ; 
separate the hunches into smaller ones, and 
dry them by the heat of a stove, or in a 
Dutch oven before a common fire, in such 
quantities at a time, tlrat the process may be 
speedily finished ; i. e. ' Kill 'em quick,' 
says a great botanist; by this means their 
flavor will behest preserved: there can be 
no doubt of the propriety of drying herbs, 
&c. hastily by the aid of artificial heat, 
rather than by the heat of the sun. In the 
application of artificial heat, the only cau- 
tion requisite is t<> avoid burning ; and of 
this a sufficient test is afforded by the pres- 
ervation of the color. The common cus- 
tom is, when they are perfectly dried to put 
them in bags, and lay them in a dry place; 
but the best way to preserve the flavor of 
aromatic plants is to pick off the leaves as 
soon as they are dried, and to pound them, 
and put them through a hair sieve, and keep 
them in Irell-atopped lx>!tles. The common 
custom is to put them into paper bags, and 
lay them on a shelf in the kitchen, exposed 
to all the fumes, steam, and smoke, &c.: 
thus they soon lose their flavor. 

N. B. Herbs nicely dried are a very ac- 
ceptable substitute when fresh ones cannot 
be got; but, however carefully dried, the 
flavor and fragrance of the fresh herbs are 
incomparably finer. 

HERRINGS. There are three sorts of 
herrings, fresh, salted, and dried or red her- 
rings. They are emptied and cleaned like 
any other li/li ; when fresh, they are broiled, 
and served with melted butler, white sauce, 
&c. 

The salted herring should lie soaked in 
cold water before it is cooked ; this is also 
broiled ; sometimes, however, it is cut in 
pieces, and eaten raw. 

The red hen-ing is split down the back, 
the head and tail are cut off, and the fish 
broiled like the others. 

They may also be dressed as follows: 
when they have lain in cold water a suffi- 
cient time, soak them for two hours in milk, 
then split them down the back ; then have 
ready some melted batter, in which has been 
mixed basil and bay-leaf, minced small, the 
yolks of two eggs, pepper and nutmeg ; nib 
the herrings well with this, bread them; 
broil them over a gentle fire, and serve with 
lemon-juice. 

The best red herrings are full of roe, 
are firm and large, and have a yellow- 
cast. 

Of the fresh herring the scales are bright 



if good, the eyes are full, and the gills red, 
the fish also should I* stiff. 

HERRINGS, FOILED. Scale, and 
otherwise prepare the hen-ings in the usual 
way ; dry them well, and rub them over with 
a little salt and vinegar; skewer their tails 
in their mouths, lay them on a fL-h-plate, and 
put them into boiling water; in ten or 
twelve minutes take them out, drain them, 
lay them on the dish, the heads towards the 
middle; serve them with melted butter and 
parsley, and garnish with bonetaduh. 

HERRINGS, RED. Plain broil them, 
or pour over some Ix-er made hot, and when 
it is cold drain and wipe them dry ; heat 
them thoroughly, and rub over a little butter, 
and sprinkle them with pepper. 

HERRINGS TO BAKE. They must 
be perfectly fresh, and well cleaned, but not 
washed ; the heads and fins cut off, and the 
bones cut out; strew over them pepper, salt, 
and a slice of onion minced \eiy finely, to 
each; roll them up tight; pack them into a 
jar, and pour over in the proportion of a 
pint of vinegar to two of water, with half 
an ounce of whole black pepper; tic over 
the jar a piece of bladder or paper, and 
bake them in an oven for an hour. Takti 
off the cover when they are cold, and pom 
over a little cold vinegar, and tie them up. 

HERRINGS TO FRY. Scrape off 
the scales; cut off the lias; draw out the 
gut, keeping in the roes and melts; wipe 
them in a clean cloth; dredge them with 
flour, and fry them in boiling dripping; put 
them before the fire to drain and keep hot. 
Sauces; melted butter, and parsley and 
butter. When herrings are to be broiled, 
they are prepared in the same manner, and 
done upon the gridiron. They must not be 
washed. 

HIPPOCRAS. Take one ounce of 
cinnamon, two drachms of ginger, two pen- 
ny-weights of cloves, nutmeg, and galangal 
a penny-weight of each. Pound these to- 
gether well, and infuse them in a pint of red 
or white wine, and a pint of malmsey; to 
this, add a pound of, the best loaf sugar. 
These proportions will make a quart of 
the liquor. 

HOG'S HEAD. Put a head into some 
pickle, and when it has lain sufficiently long, 
take it out and boil it till the bones will 
come out with ease; then skin, bone, and 
chop the meat, whilst hot; season it with 
pepper (black and while), nutmeg, and salt, 
if necessary ; lay part of the skin at the 
bottom of a potting pan, press in the meat,

cover it with the remainder of the skin, put >

Then tuni it out. I'.oil the li(|iior it was 
dressed in with some vinegar, skim it well, 
and when oil, I put the head into it. 

1I()\EY TO CLARIFY. M. Fou- 
<lUE's METHOD. Take six |x>unds of 
honex , :i pi mud and three-quarters of wafer, 
two onuc. s and a quarter of [xiunded chalk, 
five oniH-es ufroal, (pulverised, washed, and 
well dried), the whites of three eggs beaten 
in three ounces of water, for eacli pound of 
honey. 

Put die honey, water, chalk, and eggs, 
into a cop|x-r vessel, capable of holding 
about one-third more than the above quanti- 
ties ; let them lx>il for two minutes, throw 
in the coal, mixing it with a spoon, and 
continue the boiling two minutes longer; 
then take the saucepan from the fire, and 
let it stand nearly a (purler of an hour, that 
the liquor mav cool ; then take a neu sieve 
(which must ix- well u ashed, or it will im- 
part a disa'jree-iMe taste), pass the honey 
through it, taking ft ire to filter the first 
drops twice, ;ts they generally cany with 
them some portion of the i 

ii|> which still adheres to the coal, 
and other materials, may be separated as 
follows: pour boiling water on them until 
they no longer retain any sweetness; then 

put these dilVereiit waters together, set them 
over a large lire to eva|>orate, till the sirup 
only remains. This sirup contracts the fla- 
vor of Inn ley sugar, and must not be added 
to the clarified honey. 

IIOKsr.KADISH POWDER. The 

time to make this is during \ovemtxT and 
December; .-lice it the thickness of a shil- 
ling, and lay it to dn very gradually in a 
Dnii li o\en (a strong heat soon eva[xirates 
its tla\or); when dry enough, pound it and 
bottle it. 

HOI' PICKLE. Boil, in two quarts of 
vinegar, a quarter of a |>oimd of salt, two 
ounces of shallots or garlic, and two of gin- 
ger, one ounce of pepper, one of yellow mus- 
i, and a (|itarter of an ounce of 
|Xit into a jar that will hold tour 
two ounces of allspice, and pour on 
it the hot pickle. Whrn cold, put in am 
ildes or fruit, such as

ICE. Sorbetieres or moulds for cream 
or fniit-ices, are made of two sorts of ma- 
terials, Mock-tin and |>ewter; of these, the 
latter is the l>est, the substance to be iced 
congealing more gradually in it than in the 
former; an object much to be desired, as 
when the ice is formed too quickly, it is very 
apt to be rough, and full of lumps like hail, 
especially if it be not well worked with the 
spatula ; the other utensils necessary for this 
operation, are, a deep pail, with a cork at 
the bottom, and a wooden spatula about 
nine inches long; being so far provided, fill 
the pail with pounded ice, over which spread 
four handfuls of salt; then having filled the 
sorbetiere, or mould, with cream, &c. ; put 
on the cover, and immerse it in the centre 
of the ice-pail; taking care the ice touches 
the mould in all parts; throw in two more 
handfuls of salt, and leave it a quarter of an 
hour; then take the cover from the mould, 
and with the spatula stir the contents up to- 
gether, so that those parts which touch the 
sides of the mould, and consequently congeal 
first, may be mixed w ith the liquid in the 
middle; work this alxnit for seven or eigh'. 
minutes; cover the mould, take the pail by 
tire ears, and shake it round and round for 
a quarter of an hour; o|>eii the mould a sec- 
ond time, and stir as Ix-lore; continue these 
operations alternately, until the en-am, or 
whatever it may l>e, is entirely congealed, 
and |x-rfe<-lly smooth, and free from lumps. 
Take care to let out the water, which will 
collect at the bottom of the pail, by means 
of the cork, and press the ice close to the 
sorlx'ticre with the spatula. 

When the cream is iced, take it from the 
|>ail, dip the mould in warm water, but not 
to let it remain an instant; dry it quickly, 
turn it out, and serve it as soon as possible. 

All sorts of ices are finished in this man- 
ner ; the preparation of the articles of which 
they are composed, constitutes the only dif- 
ference between them.

peel; do not use more of the orange-flower 
water than is just sufficient to flavor it.

bit of board, spread it all over the top and 
sides, and set it in a cool oven, and an hour 
wiU harden it. 

ICE FOR ICING (HOW TO PRE- 
PARE). Take a few pounds of ice, break 
it almost to powder, and tlirow in among it 
a large handful and a half of salt ; you must 
prepare in the coolest part of the house, that 
as little of the warm air as possible may 
come. The ice and salt lacing in a bucket, 
put your cream into an ice-pot, and cover it ; 
immerse it in the ice, and draw that round 
the |x>t, so that it may touch every part. In 
a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and 
stir it well, removing the parts that ice round 
the edges to the centre. If the ice-cream or 
water, be in a form, shut the bottom close, 
and move the whole in the ice, as you can- 
not use a spoon to that without danger of 
waste. There should be holes in the buck- 
et, to let the ice off as it thaws. 

ICING FOR CAKES. For a large 
cake, teat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar, 
put it into a mortar, with four spoonfuls of 
rose water, and the whites of two eggs, 
beaten and strained, whisk it well, and 
when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather 
in the icing, and cover the cake well; set it 
in the oven to harden, but do not let it re- 
main long enough to discolor. Keep the 
cake in a drv place. 

ICING FOR TARTS. Beat the yolk 
of an egg and some melted butter well toge- 
ther; wash the tarts with a feather, and 
sift sugar over as you put them into the 
oven ; or beat white of egg, wash the paste, 
and sift white sugar. 

ICING, FOR TWELFTH OR BRIDE 

CAKE. Take one pound of double-refined 
sugar, pounded and sifted through a lawn 
sieve; put into a pan quite free from grease; 
break in the whites of six eggs, and as much 
powder bine as will lie on a sixpence; beat 
it well with a spattle for ten minutes? thru 
squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and beat it 
till it becomes thick and trans|>areut. Set 
the cake you intend to ice in an oven or 
warm place five minutes ; then spread over 
the top and sides with the mixture as smooth 
as possible. If for a wedding cake only, 
plain ice it ; if for a twelfth cake, ornament 
it with gum paste, or fancy articles of any 
description. A good twelfth cake, not bak- 
ed two much, and kept in a cool dry place, 
will retain its moisture and eat well, if 
twelve montlis old. 

ICING FOR FRUIT TARTS, PDFFS, 
OR PASTRY. Beat up in a half-pint mug 
the white of two eggs to a solid froth; lay 



some on the middle of the pie with a paste- 
brush ; sift over plenty of pounded sugar, and 
press ii down with the hand, wash out the 
brush, and splash by degrees with water till 
the sugar is dissolved, and put it in the oven 
for ten minutes, and serve it up cold. 

IMPERIAL. Put two ounces of cream 
of tartar, and the juice and peel of two lem- 
ons, into a stone jar, pour on them seven 
quarts of boiling water, stir, and cover close. 
When cold, sweeten it with loaf sugar, strain 
it, bottle and cork it tight. Add in buttling, 
half u pint to the whole quantity. 

INDIA PICKLE. (1) Take one pound of 
ginger, put it into a pan with salt and wa- 
ter, and let it lay all night, then scrape it, 
and cut it into thin slices; put it into a jjan 
with half a pound of bay salt, and let it lay 
till all the following ingredients are prepar- 
ed; a pound of garlic peeled, and laid in 
salt for three days, then take it out, wash it, 
then let it lay in salt for another three days, 
then take it out and let it lay in the sun for 
another, till half dry; an ounce of long pep- 
per, an ounce of capsicum, salted and laid 
in the sun for three days, a pint of black 
mustard-seed bruised, half an ounce of tur- 
meric, beat very small ; put all these ingre- 
dients together in a jar, then put in as much 
vinegar, as, when tin: cabbage, or whatever 
yon intend to pickle, is put into it, the vine- 
gar will rise to the top of the jar. Then 
t;ike cablwgf, cauliflower, or whatever you 
choose to pickle, and cut them into small 
pieces, throw a good handful of salt over 
them, and set them in the sun (when it is 
very hot) for three days, drain the water 
from them every day, and fresh salt them 
again, turning the leaves till they are dry, 
then put them into the pickle, Ix'ing partic- 
ular that they are completely covered with 
the vinegar; tie it up close, let it stand a 
fortnight, lill it airain with more vinegar, 
carefully watch it from time to time, to fill 
it up with vinegar, ;is it will waste very fast. 

INDIA PICKLE. (2) One gallon of vin- 
egar, one pound of garlic, a quarter of a 
pound of long pepper split, half a pound of 
flour of mustard, one pound of ginger scrap- 
ed, and split, and two ounces of turmeric. 
When you have prepared the spice, and put 
it into the jar, pour the vinegar boiling hot 
over it, and stir it every day for a week. 
Then put in your cabbage, cauliflower, or 
whatever you intend to pickle.

into a preserving pan, with five glasses of 
filtered water, .-.-I it on tin- lire, and, as goon 
as it boils, place it at the side of the stove, 

so as to keep up the boiling ; take off the 



scum directly it rises ; and when the whole 
is reduced to three-quarters, strain it through 
a cloth into a basin for use. Some add, in 
clarifying BWglsjBjj, lemon-peel, to remove 
its disagreeable taste; but as good isinglass 
ought to have no flavor, and as the luinon- 
peel is certain to give a yellow tinge to that, 
it is much better left out.

ten or eleven more whites, working them 
well as you put them in ; but the best, crite- 
rion to go by in trying their lightness is to 
bake one or two, and if you find them heavy, 
put one or two more whites ; put the mix- 
ture into a biscuit-funnel, and lay them out

stone them, and cut them in pieces into some 
sirup, (usually made with twelve ounces of

when the liquor boils, skim it well, and let 
it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may 
be reduced to about two quarts; then strain 
it through a sieve, and skim off all the oily 
substance which is on the surface of the 
liquor. 

If you are not in a hurry, it is better to 
boil the calf's feet the day before you make 
the jelly; as when the liquor is cold, the 
oily part being at the top, and the other be- 
ing firm, with pieces of kitchen pa[>er appli- 
ed to it, you may remove every particle of 
the oily substance, without wasting any of 
the liquor. 

Put the liquor in a stewpan to melt, with 
a pound of lump sugar, the peel of two lem- 
ons, the juice of six, six whites and shells of 
eggs beat together, and a bottle of Sherry or 
Madeira; whisk the whole together until it is 
on the boil; then put it by the side of the 
stove, and let it simmer a quarter of an 
hour; strain it through a jelly-bag: what is 
strained first must be poured into the bag 
again, until it is as bright and as clear as 
rock-water; then put the jelly in moulds, to 
be cold and firm : if the weather is too warm, 
it requires some ice. 

When it is wished to be very stiff, half an 
ounce of isinglass, may be added when die 
wine is put in. 

It may be flavored by the juice of various 
fruits, spices, &c. and colored widi saf- 
fron, cochineal, red beet juice, spinage juice, 
claret, &c. ; and it is sometimes made with 
cherry brandy, or noyeau rouge, or Curacoa, 
or essence of punch, instead of wine. 

JELLY, CALF'S FEET. (2) Take 

the fiit and bones from eight feet, and soak 
them in water for tliree or four hours; 
then boil them in six quarts of water, skim- 
ming often ; when reduced to a third, strain 
and set it by to cool ; when cold, take every 
particle of fat from the top, and remove 
whatever may have settled at the bottom. 
Dissolve it in an earthen pan, adding to it 
two quarts of white wine, mace, cinnamon, 
and ginger, or not, as you please. Beat up 
the whites of twelve eggs with three pounds 
of fine sugar, mix these with the jelly, boil it 
gently, adding the juice of two lemons, and 
thru strain it for use. 

JELLY, CHERRY. Take the stones 
and stalks from two pounds of fine clear 
ripe cherries ; mix them with a quarter of 
a pound of red currants, from which the 
seeds have been extracted; express the 
juice from these fruits, filter and mix it with 
three-quarters of a pound of" clarified sugar, 
and one ounce of isinglass. Finish the .sum- 
as Barberry jelly. 

JELLY OF CURRANTS, GRAPE, 



RASPBERRY, Are all made precisely 
in the same manner. When the fruit is full 
ripe, gather it on a dry day: as soon as it 
is nicely picked, put it into a jar, and covw 
it down very close. 

Set tlie jar in a saucepan alxnit tliree 
parts filled with cold water; put it on a gen- 
tle fire, and let it simmer for about half an 
hour. Take the pan from the fire, and (xnir 
the contents of the jar into a jelly-bag: pass 
the juice through a second time; do not 
squeeze the bag. 

To each pint of juice add a pound and a 
half of very {food lump sugar pounded ; when 
it is dissolved, put it. into a preserving-pan; 
set it on the fire, and boil gently; stirring 
and skimming it the whole time (about thir- 
ty or forty minutes), i. e. till no more scum 
rises, and it is perfectly clear anil line: 
pour it while warm into pots; and when 
cold, cover them with paper welted in 
brandy. 

Half a pint of this jelly, dissolved in a 
pint of brandy or vinegar, will give you ex- 
cellent currant or raspberry brandy or vine- 
gar. 

Obs. Jellies from other fruits are made 
in the same way, and cannot 1*5 preserved 
in perfection without plentv of good sujjav. 

Those who wish jelly to turn out MTV stiff, 
dissolve isinglass in a little water, strain 
through a sieve, and add it in the proportion 
of half :iii ounce to a pint of juice. ajid jnit 
it in widi the sugar. 

The l>est way is the clM-apest. Jellies 
made with two small a proportion of susrar. 
require boiling so long; there is much more 
waste of juice and flavor by e\a|x>ration thau 
the due quantity of sugar costs; and they 
neither look nor taste half so well. 

JELLY, DAMSON. To eight (winds 
of damsons, put eight pounds of fine sugar, 
and half a pint of water; boil them for half 
an hour over a gentle fire, till the skins 
break ; then take them off, and set them by 
for an hour; set diem on the fire again, for 
half an hour more; set them by airain for 
the same time; do so the third time; while 
they stand nt}' the fire, put a weight upon 
them to keep them under the sirup. The 
last time, \on must Ixiil them till you per- 
ceiu 1 the\ are of a very high color in the 
part where the skin is broken; then take 
tliem off, set them by to cool, and when they 
arc coli!, drain off the simp, and make the 
jelly in the following manner: Boil a quan- 
tity of green apples, green goost-U-rries, and 
quince cores, lo a nia.-h ; then strain them 
through a hair sieve. Take an equal quan- 
tity of this jelly and the former sirup, and 
boil them over a gentle fire together till they 
|t ll\ : skim it well, and while it is hot, put 
it into glasses or pots.

JELLY FOR ENTREMETS. Harts- 
horn, calf's feet, and isiiiglas*, are the usual 
materials used to coagulate sweet jellies; of 
tliese three, tlie latter is the best, as. when 
properly clarified, (for which see isinglass), 
it is the clearest, and Ir.w no unpleasant 
flavor. 

JELLY FKflT. Clarify half a pound 
of sugar, but the instant before it is quite 
clear, put in a small quantity of cochineal; 
then strain, and mix with it an ounce of 
clarified isinglass, and the juice of two lem- 
oiis; add to this the fruit of which your jel- 
ly is to be roni|x>sed; stir them together 
lightly, |x>nr the jelly into a mould quickly, 
and |>iit the mould on ice. Observe I hat the 
sugar and isinglass should tx 1 no more than 
lukewarm when mixed together. These 
jellies may lie made of any kind of fruit, or 
the grated rinds of lemon, orange, or ce- 
drats. 

JELLY, GLOUCESTER. Take an

hartshoi n-> h;i\ ings, and eringo root; sim- 
mer with ihree pints of water, till reduced 
to oiid |, int. .-train it. When cold it will be 
a jelly ; win n you use it, serve dissolved in 
wine, milk, or broth. 

JELLY. <;ilAPE. Take out the stone?, 
tlwn mash the gra|x-s with your hands, (tliey 
must IK- i i|x-) ^le.n squeeze tliem through a 
cloth to extract all the juice from them, and 
Ixiil and linish the same 98 currant jelK. 
I'se half a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit. 

JELL'S . II \KTSHOK.N. lioil half a 
pound of hart-horn .-haunts lor three hours

JELLY, ORANGE. (OSqueezethc juice 

of eight orange- .mil ,-ix lemons, grate the 

peel of half the fruit, and steep it in a pint

JELLY, ORANGE. (2) Boil in a 

pint of water one ounce and a quarter of 
picked isinglass, the rind of an orange cut 
thin, a stick of cinnamon, a lew coriaiiders, 
and three ounces of loaf su;;ar, till the isin- 
glass is dissolved; then sque<-y.e two Seville 
oranges or lemons, and enough oranges to 
make a pint of juice: mix all together, and 
strain it through a (amis or lawn sieve into 
a basin ; H it in a cold place for half an 
hour ; pour it into another basin free from 
.-edimcut ; and \vlieu it begins to congeal, 
till your mould : when wanted, dip the 
mould into lukewarm water ; turn it out on 
a dish, and garnish with orange or lemon 
cut in slices, and placed round. N. B. A 
few grains of saftron put in the water will 
add much to Its appearance. 

JEIXY, OX-HEEL. Slit them in two. 
and take away the fat between the claws. 
The proportion of water to each heel is 
aljout a quart : let it simmer gently for eight 
hours (keeping it clean skimmed); it will 
make a pint and a half of strong jelly, which 
is fre |iieiitly used to make calf's feet jelly, 
or to add to mock turtle and otlier soups. 

JELLY, PEACH. Cut ten or twelve 
peaches in halves, take out the stones and 
peel them ; set a pint of smooth clarified su- 
gar, diluted with water, on the fire; when 
it has boiled and been skimmed, put in the 
peaches, the kernels should be broken and 
put in with them; let them boil, very gently 
for ten minutes, then take out four or five 
i if i lie halves, and lay them on a plate to be 
in readiness for garnishing the jelly; let 
the remainder of the peaches boil for ten 
minutes longer; while they are Ixiiling take 
three lemons, cut off the rind, squeeze the 
juice through a silk sieve in a basin, pas 
i he liquor of the |x-arlivs into it, and then 
the isinglass, running it through the sieve 
two or three times, in order to mix it well; 
fill the mould half full of jelly, and v. lieu set. 
put in llie peaches and a little more jelly, 
and when tli.it is set, (ill up the mould. 
The reason why the lemons are |xvlni lx>- 
lore the\ are sqnee/.ed li>r this jelly is, that 
the oil in the rind would rather sfxiil tile fla- 
vor of the jelly, than be any addition. 

JELLY, QUINCE. Quinces for jelly 
ought not to be quid* ripe, they should, how- 
ever, be of a fine yellow color; take off the

when mixed, put it on the fire, still stirring; 
a^ si inn as the jelly spreads over the spoon, 
and tails from it like treacle ; take it from 
the fire, and when cold, pour it into pots. 

JELLY, RASPBERRY. Take two 
thirds of nisberries, and one third red cur- 
rants; pick them, press the juioe through a 
sieve into a pan, cover, and place it in a 
cellar, or any other cool place for three days ; 
at the end of that time r.iise the thick skin 
formed at the top, and pour the juice into 
another vessel: weigh it, and put it, with 
half the quantity of sugar, into a preserving 
pan, set it oil the fire; a great deal of scum 
will rise at first, which must all be taken oft ; 
leave it on the fire for an hour ; then pour a 
few drops on a cold plate, if it cools of the 
proper consistence for jellies, take it from 
the fire and whilst hot pour it into pots ; 
Let the jelly be quite cold before the pots are 
covered. 

JELLY, RUM. Clarify, and boil to a 
sirup, a pound of loaf sugar ; dissolve one 
ounce of isinglass in half a pint of water, 
strain it through a sieve into the sirup when 
it is half warm, and when nearly cold, stir 
in a quart of white wine; mix it well, and 
add one or two table-spoonfujs of old Ja- 
maica rum, stir it for a few minutes, and 
pour it into a mould, or into glasses. 

JELLY, STRAWBERRY. Put some 
fresh-gathered straw lierries into an earthen 
pan, bruise them with a wooden spoon, add 
a little cold water, and some finely-pounded 
loaf sugar. In an hour or two, strain it 
through a jelly-bag, and to a quart of the 
juice a-ld one ounce of isinglass, which has 
been dissolved in half a pint of water, weil- 
skiimned, strained, and allowed to cool; mix 
all well, and pour it into an earthen mould. 

Rasplx'irv jelly, red currant jelly, and red 
currants mixed with raspberries, may be 
ii-tly in the same manner; and the 
bi i^ht red color may lx; improved by mixing 
in a litile carmine or lake. When this kind 
of jelly is to l)e made with cherries, the fruit 
should l>e boiled a few minutes in clarified 
sn'_;>ir, and when cold, tile juice of one or two 
lemons may be added with the isinglass. 

A little lemon juice may be added to any 
of the other jellies, in proportion to the acid- 
ity of the fruit. 

Tliey may be iced by covering and sur- 
rounding tlie mould with ice, without any salt. 

JUICE. The proportion of oranges 
should be double that of lemons; the fruit 
beini: selected free from decay, and wiped 
dry, they are to be squeezed, and the juice 
strained through a sie\e into an earthen pan ; 
to each pint, according to the acidity of the 



fruit, a pound and a half, or a pound and 
three-quarters, of double-refined sugar, bro- 
ken small, is to l>e added. It must Ix- stirred 
and skimmed daily, till the sugar is well in- 
corporated, or as long as the scum rises; 
and when it has been a month in the pan, it 
may be boiled. 

JUICE OF FRESH FRUIT ICED. 

Press through a sieve the juice of a pint of 
pickled currants or raspberries, add to it 
four or five ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a 
little lemon juice, and a pint of cream. It 
may be whisked previous to freezing, and a 
mixture of the juice may be used. 

JULIENNE. This soup is composed 
of carrots, turnips, leeks, onions, celery, let- 
tuce, sorrel and chervil ; the roots are cut in 
thin slips, about an inch long, the onions are 
halved and then sliced ; the lettuce and sor- 
rel chopped small; toss lip the roots in a 
little butter, when they are done, add the 
lettuces, &c. moisten them with broth, and 
boil the whole over a slow fire for an hour or 
more, if necessary; prepare some bread in 
the usual way, and pour the julienne over it. 

JUMBLES. Mix one pound of fine 
flour with one pound of fine powder sugar, 
make them into a light paste with whites of 
eggs well beaten ; add half a pint of cream, 
half a pound of fresh butter, melted, and a 
pound of blanched almonds, pounded ; knead 
them all together, thoroughly, with a little 
rose water, and cut out the jumbles into 
whatever forma you think proper; and eith- 
er bake them in a gentle oven, or fry tliein 
in fresh butter; serve them in a dish, melt 
fresh butter with a spoonful of mountain, and 
Miew line sugar over the dish. 

JUSTICE'S ORAJVGE SIRUP FOR 
PUNCH OR PUDDINGS. Squeeze the or- 
anges, and strain the juice from the pulp 
into a large pot; boil it up with a pound and 
a half of fine sugar to each pint of juice; 
skim it well; let it stand till cold; then 
bottle it, and cork it well. Obs. This 
makes a fine, soft, mellow-flavored punch; 
and, added to melted butter, is a good lelish 
to puddings.

KIDNEYS. Cut them through the long 
way, score them, and sprinkle them over 
with a little jtcpjxT and salt; in order to 
broil all over alike, and to keep them from 
curling on the gridiron, run a wire skewer 
riijht through them. They must lie broiled 
OM-I- a clear fire, being careful to turn them 
frequently till they are done; they will take 
alxnit ten or twelve minutes broiling, provi- 
ded they are done over a brisk fire ; or, if 
MJII choose, you may fry them in butter, and 
make gravy for them in the [Kin (after the 
kidm-vsare taken out), by putting in a tea- 
spoonful of flour; as soon as it looks brown, 
put in a sufficient quantity of water as will 
make gravy ; they will take five minutes 
longer frying than broiling. Garnish with 
fried parsley: you may improve them if you

KISSES. (1) Put the whites of ei-ht 
eggs, and two spoonfuls of orange-flower 
water, into a China basin, and whisk till 
they become a firm froth, then add half a 
IHiiiiid of sifted sugar, stir it in with 
care by means of a spatula: that done, lay 
small pieces of this mixture on white |>aper; 
make each drop about the size of a ratafia, 
rather conical than flat; place the paper 
which contains them on a piece of wood 
about an inch thick, and put them in a very 
hot oven: watch them, and as soon as you 
\e they begin to look yellowish, take 
tliem out, and detach them MB tin; |>aper 
with a knife as cautiously as possible, fo 
lliey are very tender. Take a small s[x>on, 
and with die end of it remove tlie moist part, 
which is at the bottom, so as to make tliem 
a little hollow, and as you do tic 
on the paper, the hollow side upwards; put 
them on tin; wood into the ou-n again for a 
few minutes to dry; when done, I. iy tliem 
in boxes, and keep them in a dry and warm 
place. If they are for table, fill the hollow

the mixture as evenly as possible, so ;LS to 
make tin: kisses of a round smooth shape. 
Set thciii in a cool oven, and as soon as 
they are colored, they are done. Then take 
them out and place them two bottoms to- 
gether. Lay them lightly on a sieve, and 
dry them in a cool oven, till the two bot- 
toms stick fast together, so as to form one 
ball or oval. 

KNUCKLES. See the several meats 
to which they belong. 



LAMB. The fore quarter of lamb con- 
sists of the shoulder, the neck, and the 
breast together; the hind quarter is the leg 
and loin. There are also the head and 
pluck, the fry or sweetbreads, skirts, lamb- 
stones, and liver. In choosing the fore 
quarter, the vein in the neck should be rud- 
dy, or of a bluish color. In the hind quar- 
ter, the knuckle should feel stiff, the kidney 
small, and perfectly fresh. To keep it, the 
joints should be carefully wiped every day, 
and in warm weather, sprinkled with a lit- 
tle pepper. The fore quarter is the prime 
joint, and should be roasted and basted 
with butter ; the gravy is made as for beef 
or mutton. Mint sauce is served in a sauce 
tureen, and half a lemon is sent to table 
with it, the juice of which is squeezed upon 
the ribs after die shoulder is cut off, and 
thoj have been sprinkled with salt. If the 
jeunt weighs five pounds, it will require to 
be rVoasted one hour; if ten pounds, one hour 
and three-quarters. The hind quarter may 
be roasted, or the leg of it boiled. The 
loin is then cut into steaks, fried, and serv- 
ed round it ; the outside bones being cover- 
ed with a fringe of fried parsley. A dish 
of spinach is generally served with the 
lamb. 

LAMB, Is a delicate, and commonly 
considered tender meat ; but those who talk 
of tender lamb, while they are thinking of 
the age of the animal, forget that even a 
chicken must be kept a proper time after it 
has been killed, or it will be tough picking. 
To the usual accompaniments of roasted 
meat, green mint sauce, and a salad, is com- 
monly added; and some cooks, about five 
minutes before it is done, sprinkle it with a 
little fresh gathered and finely minced pars- 
ley. - Lamb, and all young meats, ought to be 
thoroughly done; therefore do not take either 
lamb or veal off the spit till you see it drop 
white gravy. When green mint cannot be 



got, mint vinegar is an acceptable substitute 
for it ; and crisp parsley on a side plate, is 
an admirable accompaniment. 

Hind-Quarter, Of eight pounds, will 
take from an hour and three-quarters to two 
hours: baste and froth it. The li-<r and 
the loin of lamb, when little, should be 
roasted together ; the former being lean, the 
latter fat, and the gravy is better prr.-ir\Ml. 

Fare-Quarter, Often pounds, about two 
hours. It is a pretty general custom, when 
you take off the shoulder from the ribs, to 
squeeze a Seville orange over them, and 
sprinkle them with a little pepper and salt. 
This may as well be done by the cook be- 
fore it comes to table; some people are not 
remarkably ex|>ert at dividing these joints 
nicely. 

Leg, Of five pounds, from an hour to an 
hour and a half. 

Shoulder, With a quick fire, an hour. 

Ribs, About an hour to an hour and a 
quarter: joint it nicely, crack the ribs across, 
and divide them from the briskut after it ia 
roasted. 

Loin, An hour and a quarter. 

Neck, An hour. QQ 

Breast, Three-quarters of an hour. 

LAMB BREAST. Cut it into pieces, 
and stew it in a weak stock, with a ^lass 
of Port wine; add pepper and salt. \\ hen 
it is perfectly tender, thicken the sauce 
with butter and flour. Have ready cucum- 
bers stewed in gravy, put them over the 
lamb before serving. A bre:ist of mutton 
may be served in the same way. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED. Cut a 

loin or best end of the neck into chops, flat- 
ten them, and cut off the fat and skin; rub 
the gridiron with a little fat, and broil them 
on a clear fire. Turn them with steak tongs, 
till quite done. Serve them hot. 

LAMB CHOPS. Cut a neck or loin of 
lamb into chops; rub them over with the 
beaten yolk of an egg; dip them into Crated 
bread, mixed with plenty of chopped pars- 
ley, and season with lemon-peel, pepper, 
and salt; fry them alight brown in good 
dripping; make a sauce with the trimming*, 
and thicken the sauce with butter rolled in 
flour; add a little lemon pickle and mush- 
room ketchup. Garnish with fried parsley. 
They may be served with or without the 
gravy. 

LAMB CUTLETS. Cut the cutlets off 
the loin, into round bits ; trim off the fat and 
skin ; dip them into the beaten yolk of an 
egg, and then into bread crumbs, mixed 
with minced parsley, grated nutmeg, and 
lemon-peel, pepper, and salt. Fry them a

light brown in clarified beef suet; drain 
them on the bark of a sieve before the fire. 
Serve llx-m with melted butter with a little 
lemon pickle in it, or a brown sauce thick- 
ened. Garnish with cut lemon. 

LAMB DRESSED WITH RICE. 

Half roast a small lore quarter of lamb; cut 
it into steaks, season thorn with a little salt 
and pepper; lay them into a dish, and pour 
in a little- water. Boil a pound of rice 
with a blade or two of mace; strain it, and 
stir in a good piece of fresh butter, and a 
little salt, add also the greater part of the 
yolk* i if four eggs beaten; cover the lamb 
with the rice, and with a feather put over 
it the remainder of the beaten egifs. Bake 
it in an men till it has acquired a light 
brown color. 

LAMB FEET. Clean, well wash, and 
blanch six lamb's feet; stew them, till they 
'iider, in some white stock, with a 
Klice dt lean ham, one onion, some parsley, 
1 ! \vo blades of mace, a little whole 

pepper, and a few mushrooms. Before 
serving, strain die sauce ; thicken it with 
flour a|d butter, and half a pint of crram; 
boil it a quarter of an hour, add the feet 
and the juice of half a small lemon. Gar- 
nish with sip|N-U< of thin toasted bread, cut 
into a three-cornered shape. 

LAMB FRY. Fry it plain, or dip it 
: well beaten on a plate, and strew 
some line -t:i!e bread-crumbs over it; gar- 
nish with crisp parsley. 

LAMB, LEG OF, BOILED. It should 

in a cluth, that it may look as 
l>ossible. Cut the loin in steaks, 
dip them in egg, strew them over with 
bread-numbs, and fry them a nice brown, 
serve theai round the di.-h, and garnish with 
dried or fried parsley ; serve with spinach 
to eat with it. 

LAMB PIE, THE GERMAN' WAY. 
Cut a quarter of lamb into pieces, and lard 
MB With small lardons of IKICO;.. 
ed with salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a 
Ixiy-li-af; add fat bacon pounded, small on- 
ious, iiutiiie^. and sweet herbs; put these 
into the pie, and let it bake for three hours ; 
when l>aki-d, cut it open, skim oft' all tin- 
fat, |x)iir in a ragout of oysters, and serve 
hot. 

LA M B PIE, A SAVORY ONE. Cut 

the meat into pieces, and season it with 

pep|-r. salt, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, 

' . M ike a good puff paste 

..it., it, with a few 

.no and sweetbreads, seasoned 



the same as the meat. Then put in gome 
oysters and forcemeat balls, the yolks of 
hard e^<;s, and the tops of asparagus, about 
two inches long, first boiled green. Put 
Ixittor all over the pie, put on the lid, and 
let it bake tor an hour and a half in a quick 
oven. In the meantime, take a pint of gra- 
vy, the oyster liquor, a gill of red wine, and 
a little grated nutmeg. Mix all together 
with the yolks of two or three eggs, finely 
beaten, and keep stirring it tlie same way 
all the time. When it boils, pour it into 
the pie, put on die lid again, and serve it to 
table. 

LAMB, TO ROAST OR BOIL. A 

quarter of an hour is generally allowed to 
each pound of meat ; a leg of lamb of five 
pounds will therefore take an hour and a 
quarter to roast or boil, the other joints in 
the same proportion ; serve either with sa- 
lad, pickles, brocoli, cauliflowers, string 
beans, pease, potatoes, or cucumbers, raw 
or stewed. 

LAMB SHOULDER, GRILLED. Boil 
it ; score it in chequers about in inch square, 
nib it over with die yolk of an egg, pepper 
and salt it, strew it with bread-cnimbs and 
dried par.-ley, or sweet lierlw, and carbo- 
nado, i. e. grill, i. e. broil it over a clear 
fire, or put it in a Dutch oven till it is a 
nice light brown ; send up some graw with 
it, or make a sauce for it of flour and water 
well mixed together with an ounce of fresh 
butter, a table-spoonful of mushroom or 
walnut ketchup, and die juice of half a lem- 
on. See Grill sauce. Breasts of lamb 
are often done in the same way, and with 
mushroom or mutton sauce. 

LAMB STEAKS FRIED. Fry them 
of the nicest brown; when served, throw 
over them a good quantity of crumbs of 
bread fried, and crisped parsley. Or you 

may season them and broil tlu'in in buttered 
papers, either with crumbs and herbs, or 
without, according to ta.-te. 

LARD, HOG'S. The lard should be 
carefully niched in a jar, put into a kettle 
qfMter, and boiled; nm it into bladders 
IM: brt-u particularly well cleaned. 
Ivv best to have tlie bladders small, as toe 
lard will keep better, for, after the air 
reaches it, it becomes rank. Whilst it is 
melting, put in a sprig of rosemary. This 
being a very useful article in frying fish, it 
should lie prepared with great care. Mix- 
ed with baiter, it makes a fine crust. 

LARKS. These delicate little birds are 
in high season in November. Wtan they 
arc thoroughly picked, gutted, and cleansed,

truss them; do diem over with the yolk of 
egg, and then roll them in bread-crumbs ; 
8j>it them on a lark spit, and fasten that on 
to a larger spit, ten or fifteen minutes will 
lx> sufficient time to roast them in before a 
quick lire; whilst they are roasting, baste 
them with fresh butter, and sprinkle them 
with bread-crumbs till they are well cover- 
ed with them. Fry some grated bread in 
butter, set it to drain before the fire, that it 
may harden. Serve the crumbs in the dish 
under the larks, and garnish with slices of 
lemon. 

LAVENDER DROPS. Fill a quart 
bottle with the blossoms of lavender, and 
pour on it as much brandy as it will contain ; 
let it stand ten days, then strain it, and add 
of nutmeg bruised, cloves, mace, and cochi- 
neal, a quarter of an ounce each, and bot- 
tle it for use. In nervous cases, a little may- 
be taken dropped on a bit of sugar; and in 
the beginning of a bowel complaint, a tea- 
spoonful, taken in half a glass of pepper- 
mint water, will often prove efficacious. 

LAVENDER WATER. Put into a 
large bottle, eight ounces of the best recti- 
fied spirits of wine, three drachms of oil of 
lavender, one drachm of essence of ainlier- 
gris, and threepence-worth of musk ; cork 
it tightly, and shake it well every day, for 
a fortnight or three weeks. 

LEAVES, TO GREEN, FOR ORNA- 
MENTING FRUIT. Take small leaves 
of a pear-tree, keep them close stopped in 
a pan of verjuice and water, give them a 
boil in some sirup of apricots; put them l>e- 
tween two pieces of glass to dry; smooth 
and cut them into the shape of apricot- 
leaves (the leaves should be procured with 
stalks) ; stick them alwut the apricots or 
any other preserved fruit; but the leaves 
must be cut in the shape of the leaf which 
belongs to the fruit you ornament. 

LEEKS. Leeks are most generally used 
for soups, ragouts, and other made dishes, 
they are very rarely brought to table ; in 
which case dress them as follows: Put 
tin-in into the stock-pot till about three parts 
done; then take them out, drain, and soak 
them in vinegar seasoned with pepper, salt, 
and cloves; drain them again, stuff the 
hearts with afarce, dip them in batter, and 
fry them. 

LEIPZEGER PANCAKES. Beat well 
the whites of four, and the yolks of eight 
fresh eggs, and add, by degrees, half a 
pound of pounded loaf sugar, a pint and a 
half of sweet cream just warmed, half a 
pound of clarified fresh butter, two table- 



spoonfhls of fresh yeast, and a wine-glass fall 
nt spirits i >f wine ; then mix in as much sifted 
(lour as- will make it into a thick butter; 
let it rise for half an hour ; roll it out thin ; 
cut it into rounds or oblong pieces, and lay 
on them jam or marmalade; double them, 
and let them stand again to rise, and fry 
them in boiling fresh lard or butter. 

LEMONADE. To a gallon of spring 
water add some cinnamon and cloves, plen- 
ty of orange and plenty of lemon-juice, and 
a bit of the peel of each ; sweeten well with 
loaf sugar, and whisk it with the whites of 
six eggs, and the yolk of one; give it a boil, 
and then let it simmer for ten minutes ; then 
run it through a jelly-bag, and let it stand 
till cold, before it is drank. 

LEMONADE TRANSPARENT. The 

peel of fourteen lemons having been soaked 
in two quarts of water for two hours, their 
juice, one pound and a half of sugar, and a 
quart of white wine, are to be added ; a 
quart of new milk, made boiling hot, is then 
to be mixed with it, and when it has stood 
an hour, it is to be strained through a jelly- 
bag till it rung clear. 

LEMON BONBONS. Take two pounds 
of the best lump sugar, clarify and boil it to 
caramel; but just Ix'fore it reaches that 
point, grate the rind of a lemon and put in 
it; in the meanwhile molt a little butter; 
skim, and pour it off clear; take a spoonful 
of this butter, and nib it with your hand over 
a copperplate or marble slab, on which pour 
the caramel sugar: then have a sword blade, 
take an end in each hand, and impress lines 
in the sugar about an inch apart ; then im- 
press similar lines across tile first, so as to 
form small cakes ; this operation should be 
performed as quicklv as possible, lest the 
sugar should cool before the whole is mark- 
ed ; when however all is done, pass the 
blade carefully between the sugar and the 
slab, lay it on sheets of white paper, and 
when perfectly cold, separate the bonbons, 
and wrap each in paper; keep them in a 
dry place. 

LEMON BRANDY. Three quarts of 
brandy being put into an earthen jar that is 
fitted with a cover, a pound and three-quar- 
ters of fine loaf sugar, the thin parings of 
six lemons, and the juice of twelve, are to 
be added ; one quart of boiling milk is to be 
poured over the mixture, which must be 
stirred daily for eight days; it is then to be 
run through a jelly-bag and bottled. 

LEMON CHEESECAKES. Boil the 
peel of two large lemons till they are quite 
tender, and then pound it well in a mortar,

LEMON-PEEL TINCTURE. A very 
easy and economical way of obtaining, and 
preserving the flavor of lemon-peel, h to fill 
a wide-mouthed pint bottle half full of bran- 
dy, or proof spirit ; and when you use a 
lemon, pare the rind off very thin, and put 
it into the brandy, &c.: in a fortnight it 
will impregnate tlie spirit with the flavor 
very strongly. 

LEMON PICKLE. (1) Grate off a 
little of the outer rind of two dozen of lem- 
ons; divide them into four rather more than 
half way down, leaving the bottom part 
whole; rub on them equally half a ]xnnid 
of finely-beaten salt, spread them upon a 
large dish, and put them into a cool oven. 
When the juice has dried up, put them into 
a stone jar, with an ounce of cloves and one 
of mace finely Ijeaten, one ounce of nutmeg 
cut into thin slices, a quarter of an ounce of 
cayenne, and four ounces of garlic peeled, 
also half a pint of white mustard-seed bruis- 
ed and tied in a bit of muslin. Pour over 
the whole two quarts of boiling vinegar, 
stop the jar closely, and let it stand for three 
months; then strain it through a hair sieve, 
pressing it well through ; let it stand till die 
next day, pour off the clear, and put it into 
small Iwttles. Ix>t the dregs stand covered 
somC days, when it will become tine. It 
will keep good for years. When the lem- 
ons are to be used as pickle, no straining is 
necessary. 

LEMON PICKLE. (2) Cut into quar- 
ters, and pick out all the seeds of six mid- 
dling sized lemons; put them into a jar, 
strew over them two ounces of well beaten 
salt; cover the jar with a cloth and plate, 
and let it stand three days ; then put to them 
cloves and a quarter of an ounce of mace 
beaten fine, one ounce of garlic or shallot, 
two of mustard-seed bruised, and one nut- 
meg sliced. JIake a quart of vinegar tail- 
ing hot, and pour it over the ingredients; 
cover the jar, and in three or four days close 
it with a bung, and tie leather over it. It 
will be fit for use in a week, and is an im- 
provement to most sauces, ;md particularly 
to fish sauce. 

LEMON POSSET. Squeeze the jnice 
of two lemons into a China bowl, or small 
deep dish, that will hold a quart; sweeten 
it like sirup, add a little brandy ; boil one 
pint of cream with a bit of orange-peel ; 
take out the peel ; when cold, put the cream 
into a teapot, pour it to the sirup, holding 
it high. Make it the day before it is want- 
ed. 

LEMON PUDDING. See Pudding. 



LEMON RINDS MARMALADE. 

Having squeezed tlie juice from your lemons, 
cut out all tlie white part, and put the rinds 
into boiling water: as soon as they begin to 
soften, take them from the fire, and throw 
them into cold water ; then lay them on a 
sieve to drain, and make diem into marma- 
lade, in the same manner as apricots. Or- 
ange rinds are done this way. 

LEMON SPONGE. Boil half an ounce 
of isinglass in a pint of water till dissolved; 
strain it, and the following day add the 
juice of two lemons, and the grated peel of 
one; rub through a hair sieve, into the isin- 
glass a uood quantity of rasplxrry jam, that 
has stood Ix'fore the fire some time, and 
whisk it all together till like a sponge; put 
it into an earthen mould, set it in a cold 
I lace lor some hours, and turn it out. Any 
other sort of preserve may be used, and if 
made with only orange or lemon-juice, 
sweeten it with sugar, or make it with 
orange jelly which may have been left the 
day before. 

LEMON SYLLABUBS. Take a pint 

of cream, a pint of white wine, the peel of 
two lemons grated, and the juice; sugar ac-

they are wanted. If you should wish them 
to taste ver\ stront; of the lemon, you must 
make use of the juice of six lemons, and 
nearly a pound of sugar; they will keep 
four or five days. 

LKMONS, SIRUP OF. Put a pint of 
fresh lemon-juice to a pound and three- 
quarters of lump sugar; dissolve it by a 
gentle heat ; skim it till the surface is quite 
clear; add an ounce of thin-rut lemon-]>eel; 
let them simmer (very gently) together for a 
feu minutes, and run it through a flannel. 
When cold, Ixitilc and cork it closely, and 
keep it in a cool place. Or, Dissolve a 
quarter of an ounce (avoirdupois) of citric, 
i. e. crystallized lemon acid, in a pint of 
clarified sirup; flavor it with tlie peel, or 
dissolve the acid in equal parts of simple 
sirup, and sirup of lemon-peel. 

LEMON WATER. Put two slices of 
thinly pared lemon into a teapot, a little bit 
of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large 
spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint of boil- 
ing water, and stop it close for two hours. 

LEMON CONSERVE, WHITE. Boil 
a pound of tlie finest sugar, take it off the 
fire, and squeeze into it the juice of one 
lemon at different times, stirring continually;

it will make the sugar as white ad milk if 
properly done; take care not to drop any 
of the seeds into it ; work it well together, 
and when it is of an equal substance (which 
prove in the same manner as any other jelly), 
pour it into a mould. Lemon conserve Is 
made in the same manner, only that the .su- 
gar must he boiled to a greater height than 
lor white lemon conserve. 

LOBSTER. Buy these alive; the lob- 
ster merchant* sometimes keep them till 
they are starved, before they lil them; 
they are then watery, have not half their 
flavor, and like otlier persons that die of a 
consumption, have lost the calf of their legs.

ster. Pound the sjiawn and red part, and 
spread it over it; bake it a quarter of an 
hour, and just before serving, lay over it die 
tail and Ixxly shell, with the small claws put 
underneath to resemble a lobster. 

LOBSTERS OR CRABS, BUTTKRKU. 
Pick all the meat from tlie bodies of either, 
mince it small, put it into a saucepan with 
two or three table-spoonfuls of white wine, 
one of lemon-pickle, and three or four of 
rich gravy, a bit of butter, some silt, pep- 
per, and grated nutmeg; thicken it with 
tlie yolks of two ei^s leal up, and when 
quite hot, put it into the lar^e shells,; gar- 
nish them with an edging of bread toasted. 

LOBSTER FRICASSEE. Break tlie 
stalls, and take out die meat carefully, cut 
it and the red part, or coral, into pieces, 
adding the spawn; thicken with flour and 
butter some white .-lock, with which the 
shells have been boiled; season it with 
white pepper, mace, and salt, put in the 
lob.-tcr and heat it tip; just Ix-fore serving, 
add a little lemon-juice, or lemon pickle. 
Tlie stock may be made with the shells, only 
boiled in a pint of water, with some white 
pepper, .-all. and a little mace, thickened 
with cream, flour, and butter. 

LOBSTER KETCHUP. Choose a

paste, and cover it with another bit; with 
the paste-cutter mark it all round the rim, 
and pare off the paste round the edge of the 
patty-pan. When baked, take off the top, 
and with a knife take out the bread and a 
little of the inside paste, put in the prcjKir- 
ed lobster, lay on the top paste, and serve 
them in a napkin. Another way to pre- 
pare the paste. Roll it out nearly half an 
inch thick, and cut it into rounds with a 
tin cutter, and, with one or two sizes less, 
mark it in the middle about half through. 
When they are baked, carefully cut out die 
inner top of the paste, and scoop out the in- 
side, so as to make room for the mince, which 
put in, and place on the top. 

LOBSTER PATTIES. (2) Prepare the 
patties as in the last receipt. Take a hen 
lobster already boiled ; pick the meat from 
the tail and claws, and chop it fine ; put it 
into a stewpan, with a little of the inside 
spawn pounded in a mortar till quite smooth, 
an ounce of fresh butter, half a gill of cream, 
and half a gill of veal consomme, cayenne 
pepper, and salt, a tea-spoonful of essence 
faBcfeovy, the same of lemon-juice, and a 
table-spoonful of flour and water: stew it 
five minutes. 

LOBSTER PIE. (1) Boil the lobsters, 
and cut the meat of the tail into four bits ; take 
out the meat from the claws and bodies, 
pound it in a mortar, add the soft part of 
one lobster, and season with pepper, salt, 
and nutmeg, add three table-spoonfuls of 
vinegar; melt half a pound of butter, and 
mix it with the pounded meat and the crumb 
of a slice of grated bread. Put puff paste 
round the edge and side of the dish ; put in 
the tail of the lobster, then a layer of oys- 
ters with their liquor, and next the pounded 
meat ; cover it with a puff paste, and bake 
it till the paste be done. Before serving, 
pour in some rich gravy, made of a little 
weak stock in which the lobster shells have 
been boiled, with an onion, |>epper, and 
salt, and which has been strained and thick- 
ened with a bit of butter rolled in flour. 

LOBSTER PIE. (2) Take out, as 
whole as possible, the meat from the tail 
and claws of two or three boiled lobsters ; 
cut them into slices, and season them with 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Make a force- 
meat of the soft part of the bodies, together 
with grated bread, some parsley, ..and one 
anchovy minced, grated lemon-peel, mace, 
salt, and pep|>er, tle yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs bruised, Bad a bit of butter; mix 
it all together with the well-l>eaten yolk of 
an egg, and make it up into Miiall balls. 
Put the lobster into the pie-dish, and cover 
it with the forcemeat ball.", ami hard-boiled 



yolks of eggs; add more than lialf a pint of 
rich white stock, a glass of white wine, and 
a table-spoonful of lemon-juice or vinegar. 
Cover it with puff paste, and bake it only 
till the paste be done. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. Choose a fine 
spawny hen lol>ster ; 1* sure it ig fresh, pick 
out the spawn and the red coral into a mor- 
tar, add to it half an ounce of butter, pound 
it quite smooth, and rub it through a hair- 
sieve with the bark of a wooden spoon; cut 
the meat of the lobster into small squares, or 
'pull it to pieces with a fork ; put the pound- 
ed spawn into as much melted buttec as you 
think will do, and stir it together till it is 
thoroughly mixed ; now put to it the meat 
of the lobster, and warm it on the fire; take 
care it does not boil, which will spoil its 
complexion, and its brilliant red color will 
immediately fade. The above is a very easy 
and excellent manner of making this sauce. 
Some use strong beef or veal gravy instead 
of melted butter, adding anchovy, cayenne, 
ketchup, cavice, lemon-juice, or pickle, or 
wine, &c. 

LUNCHEON FOR AN INVALID. 

Put bread crumbs and red currant, or any other 
jelly, alternately into a tumbler, and when 
nearly half full, till it up with milk.

MACARONI, TO MAKE. Beat four 
eggs for eight or ten minutes, strain them, 
and stir in flour till stiff enough to work into 
a paste upon a marble, or stone slab ; add 
flour till it be a stiff paste, and work it well ; 
cut off a small bit at a time, roll it out as 
thin as paper, and cut it with a paste-cut- 
ter or knife into very narrow strips ; twist, 
and lay them upon a clean cloth, in a dry, 
warm place; in a few hours it will be per- 
fectly hard; put it into a box, with white 
paper under and over it. It may be cut in- 
to small stars, or circles, to be used for soup, 
and does not require so much tailing as the 
Italian Macaroni. 

MACARONI. The usual mode of dress- 
ing it in England is by adding a white 
sauce, and Parmesan or Cheshire cheeso, 
and burning it ; but this makes a dish which 
is proverbially unwholesome: 'tis bad quali- 
ties arise from t'ie oiled and burnt did M-. 
and the half-dressed flour and butter put into 
the white sauce. Macaroni plain boiled, 
and some rich stock or poitable soup added 
to it quite hot, will be found a delicious dish 
and \ery wholesome. Or, boil macaroni aa 
' directed in the receipt for the pudding, and

serve it quite hot in a deep tureen, and let 
each guest add grated Parmesan and cold 
butter, or oiled butter served hot, and it is 
excellent ; this ia the most common Italian 
mode of dressing it. Macaroni with cream, 
sugar, and cinnamon, or a little varicelli 
added to the cream, makes a very nice sweet 
dish. See Macaroni Pudding for the 
Boiling of it. 

MACARONI DRESSED SWEET. 

Boil two ounces of macaroni in a pint of 
milk, \vitJi a bit of lemon-peel, and a good 
bit of cinnamon, till the pipes are swelled to 
their utmost size without breaking. Lay 
them on a custard-dish, and pour a custard 
over them hot. Serve cold. 

MACARONI GRATIN. Lay fried 
bread pretty closely round a dish, boil your 
macaroni in tin- usual way, and pour it into 
the dish ; smooth it all over, and strew bread- 
crumbs on it, tlten a pretty thick layer of 
grated Parmesan cheese; drop a little melt- 
ed butter on it, and color it with a saJaman- 



MACAROM NAPOLITAINE. Boil 

two pounds of macaroni for half an hour, in 
suit anil water; thru put it into a cullender 
to drain. Take three-quarters of a pound 
of cheese grated; put a layer of macaroni, 
in a deep dish or tureen, and on it a layer 
of macaroni, the cheese, and so on, alter- 
nately, till both are used up, making the 
cheese the top; pour over it some gravy, 
melt lull' a pound of fresh butter, and put on 
the whole. Serve it very hot. 

MACARONI TO SERVE. (1) Sim- 
mer it in a little stock, \\iili pounded mace 
and salt. When qai i- M-.ider, take it out 
of the liquor, lay it in a ili.-li, grate over it a 
good deal of cheese, then over that put bread 
grated very (inc. Warm some butter with- 
out oiling, and pour it from a boat through 
a little earthen cullender all o\er tlie crums, 
then put the ilisli in a Dutch oven to roast 
he cheese, and brown tin- hivad of a fine 
color. The bread should be in separate 
crums, and look light. 

M V i ' \ K< ).\ I TO SERVE. (2) Wash 

it well, and simmer it in half milk, and 
half of veal or mutton stock, till tile 
macaroni is tender; then take a spoonful

nearly done; then strain it, and add a gill 
of cream, two ounces of butter, a table spoon- 
ful of the essence of ham, three ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese, and a little cayenne 
pepper and salt ; mix them over a fire for 
five minutes, then put it on a dish, strew 
grated Pai mesan cheese over it, smooth it 
over widi a knife, and color it with a very 
hot salamander. 

, MACARONI TIMBALE. Take some 
puff paste, roll it thin, and cut it into narrow 
bands; twist each into a kind of cord, 
which place round the ins ides of buttered 
moulds, snail fashion; fill each mould with 
macaroni, cover the tops with grated bread, 
and Parmesan cheese (equal quantities of 
each) ; put the Timbales into a warm oven, 
and bake diem three-quarters of an hour ; 
then turn them 91 a dish, and serve. 

MACAROONS. Take a pound of sweet 
almonds blanched, and nicely pounded, add a 
little rose-water to pi-event their oiling ; add 
a pound of sifted sugar, then whisk the whites 
of ten eggs to a solid froth, and add to 
the above; beat all togedier for some time. 
Have ready wafer paper on tin plates, drop 
the mixture over it separately, the size of a 
shilling, or smaller; sift over them a little 
sugar, and bake them. 

MACAROONS, SWEET. Blanch a 
pound of sweet almonds, throw them into 
cold water for a few minutes, lay them in a 
napkin to dry, and leave them for twenty- 
four hours ; at t lie end of that time, pound 
them, a handful at a time, adding occasion- 
ally some white of egg, till the whole is re- 
duced to a fine paste; then take two pounds 
of tlie best lump sugar, pound and sift it, 
then put it to the almonds, with the grated 
rinds of two lemons; beat these ingredients 
together in tlie mortar, adding one at a time, 
as many eggs as you find necessary to moist- 
en the paste, which should lie thin, Ixit not 
too much so, as in that case it would run; 
your |>aste licing ready, take out a little in a 
s|NX)ii,and l.u the macaroons on sheets of 
white pa|r eilltcr round or oval, as you 
please ; lay them at least an inch apart, be- 
cause t In A .-pread in baking, and if (Hit near- 
er would touch. Tlie whole of your paste 
being used, place tlie sheets of paper on 
tins in a moderate oven for three-quarters of 
an hour. ., 

This kind of cake requires great care and 
attention; it will be well therefore to take 
notice of the following rules: 1. To mind 
that the almonds are |>ciTectly dry Ulbre 
you begin to pound them. 2. Take great 
care ill, it not a particle of the yolk is mixed 
with the while of egg, which would entirely 



MAC 



114 



MAI 



spoil the color of die macaroons, and prevent 
their rising in the oven ; to avoid this, open 
each separately, and if perfectly fresh, divide 
the yolk and white with great care. 3. The 
oven must be no more than moderately heat- 
ed, nothing being more liable to burn than 
almonds and sugar; by the least negligence 
in tliis res|x>ct, the surface would be burned, 
whilst the inside would remain unl>aked. 
The best method to obviate any mischief of 
this sort: put two or three macaroons into 
the even to try it ; leave them in tlie usual 
time; and if, when you take them out, they 
are of a clear yellow, the oven is properly 
heated, and the whole of the macaroons may 
then be put in. 

MACKEREL, TO CHOOSE. Their 
gills should be of a fine red, their eyes full, 
and the whole fish stiff and bright; if the 
gills are of a faint color, the fish limber and 
wrinkled, they are not fresh. 

MACKEREL BAKED. Cut off their 
heads, open them, and take out the roes and 
clean them thoroughly ; rub them on the in- 
side with a little pepper and salt, put the 
roes in again, season them (with a mixture 
of powdered allspice, black pepper, and 
salt, well nibbed together), and lay them 
close in a baking-pan, cover them with equal 
quantities of cold vinegar and water, tie 
diem down with strong white paper doubled, 
and hake them for an hour in a slow oven. 
They will keep for a fortnight. 

MACKEREL BOILED. This fish 
loses its life as soon as it leaves the sea, and 
the fresher it is the better. Wash and clean 
them thoroughly (tlie fishmongers seldom do 
this sufficiently), put them into cold water 
with a handful of salt in it; let them rather 
simmer than boil; a small mackerel will be 
done enough in about a quarter of an hour; 
when the eye starts and the tail splits, they 
are done; do not let them stand in the wa- 
ter a moment after; they are so delicate 
that the heat of tlie water will break them. 

MACKEREL BROILED. Clean a fine 
large mackerel, wipe it on a dry cloth, and 
cut a long slit down tlie back ; lay it on a 
clean gridiron, over a very clear, slow fire; 
when it is done on one side, turn it; be 
careful that it does not burn; send it up 
with fennel sauce; mix well together a 
little finely minced fennel and parsley, sea- 
soned with a little |x-pper and salt, a bit of 
froh 1 Hitter, and when the mackerel are 
reads l">r the table, put some of this into 
each fi.-li. 

MACKEREL, THE GERMAN WAY. 

Split tin-in down tlie back, and season them 



with pepper and salt ; broil them, and serve 
with tlie following sauce; pick and wash 
some fennel, | sirs ley, mint, thyme, and green 
onions ; but use only a small quantity of each. 
Boil them tender in a little veal stock ; then 
chop them up, and add to them some fresh 
butter, the liquor they were boiled in, some 
grated nutmeg, the juice of half a lemon, a 
little cayenne |>cp|>er, and salt. Ix?t it boil, 
thicken it with Hour, and serve in a sauce 
boat. 

MADE DISHES. Be careful to trim 
off all the skin, gristle, &c. that will not be 
eaten ; and sh;i])e handsomely, and of even 
thickness, the, various articles which compose 
your made dishes: this is sadly neglected by 
common cooks. Only stew them till they 
are just tender, and do not stew them to 
rags; therefore, what you prepare tlie day 
before it is to be eaten, do not dress quite 
enough the first day. We have given re- 
ceipts for the most easy and simple way to 
make HASHES, &c. Those who are well 
skilled in culinary aits can dress up things 
in this way, so as to be as agreeable as they 
were the first time they were cooked. 

MADELAINES. Take nine ounces of 
powder-sugar, eight of flour, the yolks of 
four and six whole eggs, two spoonfuls of 
brandy, and a grain of salt ; put these into 
a saucepan, stirring continually, until the 
paste thickens; after which, stir only one 
minute; clarify ten ounces of good fresh but- 
ter, with which, butter about two and thirty 
madelaine moulds, pour the remainder of tlie 
butter into your preparation; set it on a 
gentle stove, stir till it begins to become li- 
quid, take it off before it has time to get too 
hot, put a little of this into each mould, and 
bake them in a moderate oven. 

M A D E L A I N E S IN SURPRISE. 

Make them in the usual way; when cold, 
cut a thin slice from the bottom, take out 
nearly all the inside; pound four ounces 
of blanched lillxTts, mix them with eight 
spoonfuls of apricot marmalade, which 
mixture put into the madclaincs, and place 
the slice taken from the bottom, and serve 
diem. 

MAITRE D'HOTEL, COLD. Put a

with some parsley and shallots, minced small, 
salt, whole pepper, and lemon-juice; mix 
the whole together with a wooden spoon.

MARCHPANE ROYAL. Take a

moistening with orange-flower and plain 
water, but take care not to put too much at

them mi tin- sjr.itirii; as above, glaze and co- 
lor them i:i a quick oven. 

MMMORVM, SWEET, TO PRE- 
SERVE. Beat up very well the white of 
an egg, then lieat very fine and sift some

MEAD. (1) To every gallon of water 
put four pounds of honey, boil it an hour. 
Then put it into a tub with some \ea.-t on a 
toast ; cover it over. If it ferments well af- 
ter three or four days, draw it off" clear, and 
put it into a cask, with one lemon sliced to 
every gallon ; add a bottle of brandy to eve- 
ry ten gallons. The rind of Seville oranges, 
cut very thin, suspended in the barrel, is a 
great improvement to the flavor. It is best 
to wash the cask round with part of the 
brandy, before the liquor is put in. 

MEAD. (2) One part of honey is dissolv- 
ed in three parts of water, and boiled over a 
moderate fire till it is reduced to two-thirds 
of the quantity. It is then skimmed, and 
pit into a barrel, which must be quite full; 
it is allowed to subside for three or four 
days, and then drawn off" for use. To make 
it from the combs from which honey has been 
drained, they are to be beaten in warm wa- 
ter, and after the liquor lias sulisided, it is 
to be strained. The cottagers in Scotland 
make an excellent beer by adding a little 
yeast to the strained liquor, and allowing it 
to ferment, for a few days, in a cask, and 
then bottling it. 

MEAT CAKES. Take whatever meat, 
game, or (xniltry, you may chance to have, 
(it !s the better for being under-done) ; mince 
it fine, adding a little fat bacon or ham, or 
anchovy; season with a little pepper and 
salt ; mix the whole well together, and make 
it into small cakes, about three inches in 
length, an inch and a half in width, and half 
an inch thick ; fry them of a light brown, 
and serve thr-m with good gravy; or put it 
into a mould, ami boil or Like it. 

MEAT, TO KEEP HOT. If your 
!.'.- u i- o M beftn ;."ii are ready to serve, 
take it iij), sol tlic di.-h over a pan of boiling 
water, put a dei^i cover over it, so as not to 
touch the meat, and then put a cloth over 
that. Thi.-i way will nut dry up the gravy.

fined sugar are to be dissolved in the strain- 
ed juice of three dozen lemons, and, when 
quite settled, two gallons of brandy, and two 
gallons and a half of cold water, are to be 
added, and also the lemon-peel ; one gallon 
of boiling milk being then poured over the 
ingredients, they are to stand closely covered 
for twenty-four hours ; when, being skimmed 
and run through a very thick jelly-bag, it 
may be quickly bottled, and will be fit for 
immediate use ; but it improves by keeping. 

MINCED COLLOPS. This is a fe- 
vorite Scotch dish; few families are with- 
out it: it keeps well, and is always ready to 
make an extra dish. Take beef, and chop 
and mince it very small; to which add some 
salt and pepper. Put this, in its raw state, 
into small jars, and pour on the top some clar- 
ified butter. When intended for use, put the 
clarified butter into a frying-pan, and slice 
some onions into the pan, and fry them. Add 
a little water to it, and then put in the minced 
meat. Stew it well, and in a few minutes 
it will be fit to serve up. See Collops. 

MINCE MEAT. Two pounds of beef 
suet, picked and chopped fine; two pounds 
of apple, pared, cored, and minced ; three 
pounds of currants, washed and picked ; one 
pound of raisins, stoned and chopped fine; 
one pound of good moist sugar; half a pound 
of citron, and one pound of candied lemon 
and orange-peel, cut into thin slices; two 
pounds of ready-dressed roast beef, free from 
skin and gristle, and chopped fine ; two nut- 
megs, graled; one ounce of salt, one of 
ground ginger, lialf an ounce of coriander 
seeds, half an ounce of allspice, half an ounce 
of cloves, all ground fine ; the juice of six 
lemons, and their rinds grated; half a pint 
of brandy, and a pint of sweet wine. Mix 
the suet, apples, currants, meat-plums, and 
sweetmeats, well together in a large pan, 
and strew in the spice by degrees; mix the 
sugar, lemon-juice, wine, and brandy, and 
];our it to the other ingredients, and stir it 
well together ; set it by in close-covered pans 
in a cold place: when wanted, stir it up from 
the bottom, and'add half a glass of brandy 
to the quantity you require. N. B. The same 
weight of tripe is frequently substituted for 
the meat, and sometimes the yolks of eggs 
boiled hard. Obs. The lean side of a but- 
tock, thoroughly roasted, is genera Uy chosen 
for mince meat. 

MI.NUTEN FLEISH. Cut from off a 
leg of veal some slices as thin as the blade 
pf a knife, and about four inches long; sea- 
son them with pepper and salt, lay them in- 
to a deep dish, pour over them nearly half 
a pint of while wine, let it stand for three 
hours. Cover the liottom of u stcwpan with 



butter, dredge each slice of the veaJ on both 
sides with flour; add a little more wine, 
and as much good white stock as will cover 
it, and the juice of a lemon. Cover tlie pan 
closely, and let it simmer five minutes, and 
serve it instantly, otlierwise it will become 
hard.

Ml SIIUOOMS, TO CHOOSE. The 

mushrooms projxT to Ix? used in cookery 
grow in the o|>cii justure land, for tlioee that 



grow near or under trees, are poisonous. 
The eatable mushrooms first appear very 
small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. 
They UTOW very rapidly, and the up|r part 
and slalk are white. As they increase in 
size, the under part gradually opens, and 
shows a fringed fur of a very fine salmon co- 
lor, which continues more or less till the 
mushroom has gained some size, and then 
turns to a dark brown. The.-c marks should 
be attended to, and likewise whether the 
skin can be easily parted from tlie edge 
and middle, and whether they have a pleas- 
ant smell. Those which are poisonous have 
a yellow skin, and tlie under part has not the 
clear flesh color of the real mushroom ; be- 
sides which, they smell rank and disagreea- 
ble, and the for is white or yellow. 

MUSHROOM KETCHUP. If you 

love good ketchup, gentle reader, make it 
yourself, after the following directions, and 
you will have a delicious relish for made- 
dishes, ragouts, soups, sauces, or hashes. 

Mushroom gravy approaches tlie nature 
and flavor of meat gravy, more than any 
table juice, and is the" superlative siilwtitute 
for it: in meagre soups and extempore gra- 
vies, the chemistry of the kitchen has yet 
contrived to agreeably awaken the palate, 
and encourage the appetite. 

A couple of quarts of double ketchup, 
made according to the following receipt, 
will save you some score pounds of meat, 
lie-ides a vast deal of time and trouble; as it 
will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce 
as can be made for either fish, flesh, or fowl. 

I believe the following is the best way of 

ting and preparing the essence of 

mn-hroom-, so as to procure and present 

their flavor liir a considerable length of lime. 

Look out tin- mushrooms from tlie lieu'in- 
nini; of Septcnilier. 

Take care they are the right sort, and 
fre-li gathered. Full-grown tla|)s are tone 
preferred: put a layer of these at the bottom 
of a deep earthen pan, and sprinkle them 
with salt; then another layer of mushrooms, 
and some more salt on them ; and so on al- 
ternately, s;(lt and mushrooms: let tin-in re- 
main two or three hours, by which time tlie 
salt will have penetrated the muslin 
rendered them easy to break ; then |xiund 
them in a mortar, or mash them well with 
your hands, and let tlicm remain f!>r a coiipl,: 
of dajs, not longer, stirring them rp, and 
mashing them well each day ; then |x>nr them 
.ne jar. and to each quart add an 
ounce and a half of whole black |-pper, and 
half an ounce of allspice; stop tin- jar very 
close, and s< t it in a stewpan of Uiilins wa- 
ter and keep it lx)ilin^' for two hours at least. 
Take out tlie jar, and pour tlie juice clear 



MUS

MUT 



from the settlings through a hair sieve (without 
squeezing the mushrooms) into a clean stew- 
pan; let it boil very gently for half an hour: 
those who are for superlative ketchup, will 
continue the boiling till the mushroom-juice 
is reduced to half the quantity ; it may then 
be called double cat-sup or dog-sup. 

There are several advantages attending 
tills concentration; it will keep much better, 
and only half the quantity lie required; so 
you can flavor sauce, &c. without thinning 
it: neither is this an extravagant way of 
making it, for merely the aqueous part is 
evaporated ; skim it well, and pour it into a 
clean dry jar, or jug; cover it close, and let 
it stand in a cool place till next da\ ; then 
pour it off as gently as |x>ssible (so as not to 
disturb the settlings at the bottom of the 
jug,) through a tamis, or thick flannel bag, 
till it is perfectly clear; add a table-spoon- 
fill of good brandy to each pint of ketchup, 
and let it stand as before; a fresh sediment 
will be deposited, from which the ketchup is 
to be quietly poured off, and bottled in pints 
or half pints (which have been washed with 
brandy or spirit): it is best to keep it in 
such quantities as are soon used. 

Take especial care that it is closely cork- 
ed, and sealed down, or dipped in bottle ce- 
ment. 

If kept in a cool, dry place, it may be 
preserved for a long time ; but if it be badly 
corked, and kept in a damp place, it will 
soon spoil. 

Examine it from time to time, by plac- ! 
ing a strong light behind the neck of tin- 
bottle, and if any pellicle appears alx>ut it, I 
boil it up again with a few peppercorns. 

MUSHROOMS TO PICKLE. Cut 

off the stalks, and wash clean, in cold wa- 
ter, some small button mushrooms ; nib them 
with a bit of flannel, then throw them into 
fresh water, and when perfectly clean, put 
them into a saucepan with fresh cold water, 
and let them boil eight or ten minutes; strain 
off the water, lay them into the folds of a 
cloth. Boil, in a quart of vinegar, a quarter 
of an ounce of pepper, the same of allspice, 
and two or three blades of mace, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; put the mushrooms into a 
jar, and when the vinegar is cold, pour it, 
with the spices, over them. 

MUSHROOMS TO STEW. Fora 
good-sized dish, take a pint of white stock, 
season it with salt, pepper, and a little lemon 
pickle, thicken it with a bit of butter rolled 
in flour; cleanse and peel the mushrooms, 
sprinkle them with a very little salt, boil 
them for three or four minutes, put them into 
the gravy when it is hot, and stew them for 
fifteen minutes. 



MUSTARD. Mix (by degrees, by rub- 
bing together in a mortar) the best floor of 
mustard, with vinegar, white wine, or cold 
water, in which scraped horseradish has 
been boiled ; rub it well together for at least 
ten minutes, till it is perfectly smooth; it 
will keep in a stone jar closely stopped, fora 
fortnight : onlv put as much into the mustard- 
pot as will be used in a day or two. Obs. 
Mustard is the best of all the stimulants that 
are employed to give energy to the digestive 
organs. Some opulent epicures mix it with 
Sherry or Madeira wine, or distilled or fla- 
vored vinegar, instead of horseradish water. 
The French flavor their mustard with Cham- 
]>aigne and other wines, or with vinegar fla- 
vored with capers, anchovies, tarragon, elder, 
basil, burnet, garlic, eschalot, or celery, 
wanning it with cayenne, or the various 
spices; sweet, savory, fine herbs, truffles, 
ketchup, &c. &c., and seem to consider 
mustard merely as a vehicle of flavors. 

MUSTARD IN A MIM'Tll. Mix 
very gradually, and nib together in a mortar, 
an ounce of flour of mustard, with three ta- 
ble-spoonfuls of milk (cream is better), half 
a tea-spoonful of salt, and the same of sugar; 
nib them well together till quite smooth. 
Obs. Mustard made in this manner is riot 
at all bitter, and is therefore instantly ready 
for the table. 

MUTTON. (1) The pipe that runs along 
the bone of die inside of a chine of mutton 
ought to be taken away ; and if it is to be 
kept any length of time, the part close round 
tlie tail should be rubbed with salt, previously 
cutting out the kernel. 

It is IK-SI for the butcher to take out the 
kernel in the fat on the thick part of tlie leg, 
as that is the part most likely to become 
tainted. The chine and rib-bones should be 
wiped every day ; and the bloody part of tlie 
neck be cut off, in order to preserve it. The 
brisket changes tirst in the breast; therefore, 
if it is to IK- kepi, it is Ix-st, should the 
weather be hot, to nib it with a little salt. 

When intended tor roasting, it should hang 
as Ion*,' as it will keep, tlie hind quarter 
particularly ; but not so long as to become 
tainted. 

Mutton for boiling ought not to hang 
long, as it will prevent its looking of a good 
color. 

The greatest care should be taken to pre- 
serve, by paper, the fat of what is roasted. 

MUTTON. (2) As beef requires a large, 
sound fire, mutton must have a brisk and 
sharp one. If you wish to have mutton 
tender, it should be hung almost as long as 
it will keep; and then good eight-tooth, t. e.

fcur yean old mutton, is aa good eating as 

venison. 

The teg, haunch, and saddle will ! the 
better tor being hung up in a cool airy place 
for four or five days at least; in temperate 
weather, a week ; in cold weather, ten days. 

A Leg, of eight [XMinds, will take alx>ut 
two hours: let it U; MB boated, and frothed. 

A Chine or Saddle, ('. e. the two loins) 
of ten or eleven pounds, two hours and a 
half: it is the business of the butcher to lake 
olf the .-kin and skoxvcr it on again, to defend 
tin.- incut from extreme heat, and preserve its 
succulence; if this is Baghdad, tie a sheet 
of pajx-r oxer it (baste tlie strings you tie it 
on with directly, or they will burn): about a 
quarter of an hour before you think it will 
lie done, take oft' tile skin or paper, that it 
,i pale brown color, then l>aste it and 
flour it lightly to froth it. N. B. Desire 
the butcher to cut oft' the fla|>s and the tail 
and chump end, and trim away ever)' jwrt 
that lias not indisputable pretensions to !

pounds weight to alxnit six or seven |x>unds.

bone, and mi 1 it along die blade-lx>ne. 
N. B. The blade-lxnic is a favorite luncheon 
or supper relish, scored, pep|x-red and salt- 
ed, and broiled, or done in a Dutch oven. 

A Loin, of mutton, from an hour and a 
half to an hour and three-quarters. The 
most elegant way of carving this, is to cut it 
lengthwise, as yon do a saddle. N. B. Spit 
il on a skewer or lark spit, and tie that on 
the common spit, and do not spoil the meat 
by running the spit through the prime part 
of it. 

A Neck, alxMit the sairx- time as a loin. 
It inn-it ! carefully jointed, or it is xeix 
difficult to cane. The m-ck and breast are,

Cut a neck of mutton into chops ; beat them 
flat with a rolling-pin. Bruise the yolk of 
a hard-boiled egg, and mix with it chopped 
sweet herbs, grated bread, nutmeg, salt, and 
pepper. Cover the steaks witli It, and put 
each into a piece of well-buttered paper; 
broil them over a clear fire, turning them of- 
ten. Serve them in die paper, 6r with a 
browned gravy. 

MUTTON CUTLETS. Cut into cut- 
lets a pound and a half of the thick part of 
a leg of mutton, and beat them; mix with 
grated bread crumbs, some pepper, salt, and 
finely chopped parsley, lemon thyme, and 
sweet marjoram. Rub die cutlets with nielt- 
cd butter, and cover them thickly with the 
prepared bread; fry them for ten minutes in 
butter, then put them into a saucepan with 
some good gravy diickened with flour and 
butter, and simmer diem for ten or fifteen 
minutes. 

MUTTON FILLET, STEWED. Put 

a fillet of mutton or a piece of beef, weigh- 
ing about seven pounds, into a stewpan, with 
a carrot, a turnip, an onion stuck with two 
or du-ee cloves, and a pint of water. Put 
round the edge of the stewpan, a rim of 
coarse paste, that the cover may be kept 
very close, and let it stew gently, three hours 
and a half; take out the meat, skim oft" the 
fat, strain and thicken the gravy, have ready 
some boiled carrots and turnips cut to fancy, 
add them to the gravy, make all hot, and 
serve with a garnish of sliced gherkins. 

MUTTON CUTLETS BREADED AND 
BROILED. Trim and season your cutlets 
with pepper and salt, put them into some 
melted butter, and when diey have imbibed 
a sufficient quantity of it, take them out, and 
cover them completely with bread crumbs; 
give die cutlets a good shape, and broil them 
over a clear fire ; take care not to do die cut- 
lets too much, to burn the bread. 

MUTTON GRAVY FOR VENISON 
OR HARE. The best gravy for venison is 
that made with the trimmings of the, joint: 
if dlis is all used, and you have no undressed 
venison, cut a scrag of mutton in pieces; 
broil it a little brown; dien put it into a 
clean stewpan, with a quart of boiling wa- 
ter ; cover il close, and let it simmer gently 
for an hour: now uncover die stewpan, and 
let it reduce to diree-quarters of a pint ; pour 
it through a hair-sieve ; take the fat off, and 
send it up in a boat. It is only to be sea- 
soned widi a little salt, that it may not over- 
power die natural flavor of die meat. 

MUTTON, TO HASH. Cut the meat 
into thin slices, trim off all die sinews, skin, 



gristle, &c. ; put in nothing l*it what is to 
lie eaten, lay them on a plate, ready; pre- 
pare your sauce to warm it in, put in die 
meat, and let it simmer gently till it is thor- 
oughly warm: do not let it boil, us that will 
make die meat tough and hard, and it will 
be a harsh, instead of a hash. Select for 
your hash those parts of die joint diat are 
least done. Hashing is a mode of cookery 
by no means suited to delicate stomachs: 
unless the meat, be considerably under-done 
die first time, a second dressinu must spoil 
it, tor what is done enough the first time, 
must be done too much die second. 

MUTTON HAM, TO CURE. Cut a 

hind quarter of IM >d mutton into the sliaj>e of 
a ham, pound one ounce of salt]>etre, with 
one pound of coarse salt and a quarter of a 
pound of brown sugar, rub die ham \\ ell with 
this mixture, taking care to stutV the hole of 
the shank well with salt and sugar, and let 
it lie a fortnight, nibbing it well \\ ith the 
pickle every two or three days ; then take 
it out and press it with a weight for one 
day; smoke it with saw-dust for ten or fif- 
teen days, or hang it to dry in the kitchen. 
If die ham is to be boiled soon after it has 
lieen smoked, soak it one hour, and if it has 
been smoked any length of time il will re- 
quire to be soaked several hours. Put it on 
in cold water, and boil it gently two hours. 
It is eaten cold at breakfast, luncheon, or 
supper. A mutton ham is sometimes cured 
with the above quantity of salt and sugar, 
with the addition of half an ounce of pepper, 
a quarter of an ounce of cloves, and one nut- 
meg. 

MUTTON HAUNCH, LIKE VENI- 
SON. Take a fat haunch of large fine 
mutton, let it hang a week, then pound 
one ounce of black, and one ounce of Jamai- 
ca pepper, and rub them over the mutton, 
pour a bottle of Port wine over it, and let it 
remain in this five days, basting it frequent- 
ly every day with the liquor, take it out and 
hang it up four or five days more, or as long 
as die weather favors its keeping; wipe it 
three or four times a day with a clean cloth. 
While it is roasting haste it with the liquor 
it was steeped in, adding a little more Port 
wine ; a quarter of an hour before taking it 
from die fire, baste it well with butter, and 
dredge flour over it to froth it up. Serve it 
widi sauces as for venison. 

MUTTON HAUNCH. It should 
be kept as long as you can possibly keep it 
sweet by the different modes ; and if neces- 
sary, wash it with warm milk and water, 
or vinegar, and when going to be dressed, be 
careftil to wash it well, to prevent die out- 
side from having a bad flavor from keeping ;

before you put the haunch to the fire, fold it 
in a paste of coarse flour, or strong pa|>er; 
then set it a good distance from the tire, and 
allow proportionable time for the paste; do 
not take it off, till about thirty-five or forty 
minutes before serving the inntton, and then 
baste continually; bring the liauneh nearer 
before taking oil' the paste, and tVntli it up 
in the same manner as venison. For gravy, 
take a pound and a half of loin of mutton, 
and simmer it in a pint of water till reduced 
to half, use no seasoning l>m salt: lirown it 
with a little Ixirnt sii!*ar, and serve it up in 
the dish; Inn there should lie a good deal of 
gravy in tile meat, for thu<;h long at the fire, 
the covering and distance \\ill pi-event its 
roasting out. .Serve with currant-jelly sauce. 

MUTTON LEG. (1) If your leg 
of mutton is roasted, serve with onion or 
currant-jelly sauce ; if it is boiled, serve with 
ca|>er-saiice and vegetables, In roasting or 
boiling, a quarter of an hour is usually alloxv- 
ich |xiimd of me.il. 

MI T TON LEG. (2) Cut off (he shank 
!*>ne, and trim die knuckle, put it into luke- 
warm water for ten minutes, wash it clean, 
cover it xvith cold water, and let it simmer 
very gently, and skim it carefully. A leg 
of nine pounds \xill take two and a half or 
three hours, if yon like it thoroughly done, 
es|'ciall\ in very cold weather. 

The tit-bits with an epicure are the 
" knuckle," ti>e kernel, railed the "pope's 
eye," and the " gentleman's" or " cramp 
bone." 

When mutton is very large, you may di- 
vide it, and roast thf fillet, i. e. the laiire 
end, and boil the knuckle end; von may 
also cut some fine cutlets oft" the thick end 
of the. !!{, and so have two or three good 
hot dinners. 

The liquor the mutton it boiled in, you 
may convert into uo i soup in five minutes. 
' -arley bn .th. Thug managed, a 
leg of mutton is a most economical joint. 

MITTON LEG STUFFED. Make 

a stuffing xvith a little Uvf-s.net chopped, 
some parsley, thyme, marjoram, a little 
grated lemon, miimc<r grated, pepper, salt, 

and a few bread cnnnl*, mix all together 
with the yolk of an e_ r i:. put this under the

s e oyster-liquor, a little red wine, an an- 
chovy, and some more oysters stewed, and 
served under the mutton. 

MUTTON LOIN. Roast it; some 
people think it cats much better if cut length- 
ways like a saddle. It may also be used 
for steaks, pies, or broth, only taking care 
to cut off as much fat as possible. 

MUTTON LOIN, STEWED. Bone 
and skin the loin; stew it in a pint of 
water, turning it frequently; when tlie li- 
quor is half wasted, take out the loin and 
strain it, and when cold take off the fat; 
make a rich highly-seasoned gravy of the 
bones; strain and mix it with the liquor the 
loin was stewed in; add a tea-cupful of 
Port wine, and some small mushrooms; 
thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour; 
put in the mutton, and heat it thoroughly; 
garnish with pickles. 

MUTTON NECK. (1) This joint is 
[Kirticularly useful, as so many dislies may 
Ix: made of it. The bone ought to be cut 
short. 

The best end of the neck may be boiled, 

and served with turnips; or if" you think 

proper, it may be roasted, or dressed in 

steaks, or made into pies, or used for harrico. 

) You may stew the scrags in broth ; or in 

a little wafer, with small onions, some pep- 

[MTcorns, and a small quantity of rice, all 

; served together. 

When you wish that a neck which is to 

U- Uiiled should look particularly xvell, saw 

doxxn the chine bone, strip the ribs half 

I way down, and chop off the ends of the 

| bones, about four inches. 

To make the fat look particularly white, 
i the skin should not be taken off till it is 
i boiled. 

The fat belonging to the neck or loin of 
mutton, if chopped very fine, makes a most 
excellent suet-pudding, or crust for a meat 
pie. 

MUTTON NECK. (2) Put four or 
fixe pounds of the best end of a neck (that 
has been kept a few days) into as much cold 
j soft water as will cover it, and about two 
inches over; let it simmer very slowly for 
two hours: it will look most delicate if you 
do not take off the skin till it has been boil- 
ed. 

MUTTON PASTY, TO IAT AS iiicz 



MUT 



122 



MUT 



AS VENISON. Take a fat loin of mutton, 
and let it hang for several days, then bone it. 
Beat it well with a rolling pin; then rub 
ten pounds of meat with a quarter of a pound 
of sugar, and pour over it one glass of Port, 
and one glass of vinegar. Let it lie for five 
days and five nights ; after which, wash and 
wipe the meat very dry, and season it highly 
with Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. 
Lay it in your dish, and to ten pounds put 
one pound of butter, spreading it over the 
meat. Put a crust round the edge of the 
dish, and cover with a thick crust, otherwise 
it will be over-done before the meat is soak- 
ed; it must be b:iked in a slow oven. 

Put the bones in a pan in the oven, with 
just sufficient water to cover them, and one 
glass of Port, a small quantity of pepper and 
salt; by this means you will have a little rich 
gravy to add to the pasty when drawn. 

Sugar gives a greater shortness to meat, 
and a tetter flavor than salt, too great a 
quantity of which hardens the meat. Sugar 
is quite as great a preservative. 

MUTTON POLPETTES. Take the 
lean of any joint of cold roasted mutton, pare 
off fhe skin, and mince the meat with a little 
grated bacon and calf's udder ; season with 
salt, pepper, nutmeg, a few mushrooms and 
parsley, shred small; unite them together 
with the yolks of tliree eggs, and make twelve 
or fifteen balls of it, dip them in beaten egg, 
and bread them twice. Flatten these balls 
a little, and fry them in clarified butter; 
when done, drain and place them on the 
dish. Serve them with tomato sauce or 
glaze. 

MUTTON, ROLLED. Bone a shoulder 
of mutton carefully, so as not to injure the 
skin, cut all the meat from the skin, mince 
it small, and season it highly with pepper, 
nutmeg, and a clove, some parsley, lemon 
thyme, sweet marjoram chopped, and a 
pounded onion, all well mixed, together with 
a well-beaten yolk of an egg; roll it up very 
tightly in the skin, tie it round, and bake it 
in an oven two or three hours, according to 
the size of the mutton. Make a gravy of tle 
bones and parings, season with an onion, 
popper and salt, strain and thicken it with 
flour and butter; add vinegar, mushroom 
ketchup, soy, and lemon pickle, a table- 
spoonful of each, and a tea-cupful of Port 
wine; garnish with forcemeat balls, made 
of grated bread, and part of the mince. 

MUTTON, COLD SHOULDER BROIL- 
ED. A cold shoulder of roast mutton having 
only a little meat upon the blade bone, may 
be scored, sprinkled with pepper and salt, 
then broiled and served with caper sauce 



poured over it, or melted butter, in -which 
should be mixed of mushroom ketchup, lemon 
pickle, and Harvey sauce, a table-spoonful 
each. 

MUTTON SHOULDER, BAKED. 

Lard a shoulder of mutton with streaked 
bacon, put it into an earthen stewpan pro- 
portioned to the size of the joint of meat, 
with two or tliree sliced onions, a parsnip 
and carrot sliced, one clove of garlic, two 
cloves, half a bay-leaf and some basil ; add 
about a quarter of a pint of water or stock 
(stock is the best), some salt and pepper; 
put the meat into the sauce, and set it in an 
oven. When the meat is done, strain the 
sauce through a sieve, and skim it, squeezing 
the vegetables so as to make a thickening for 
your sauce: serve the sauce with the meat. 

MUTTON SHOULDER, STEWED. 
(1) Bone a shoulder of mutton with a 
sharp knife, and fill the space with the fol- 
lowing stuffing: grated bread, minced suet, 
parsley, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; bind 
with the yolks of two eggs well beaten. 
Sew or fasten it with small skewers; brown 
it in a frying-pan with a bit of butter. Break 
the bone, put it into a saucepan, with some 
water, an onion, pepper, salt, and a bunch 
of parsley; let it stew till the strength be 
extracted ; strain, and thicken it with butter 
rolled in flour; put it, with the mutton, and 
a glass of Port wine, into the saucepan ; cover 
it closely, and let it stew gently for two 
I lours. Before serving, add two table-spoon- 
fuls of mushroom ketchup. Garnish with 
pickles. 

MUTTON SHOULDER, STEW- 
ED. (2) Bone and flatten a shoulder 
of mutton, sprinkle over it pepper and 
salt, roll it up tightly, bind it with tape, and 
put it into a stewpan that will just hold it, 
pour over it a well-seasoned gravy made with 
the bones, cover the pan closely, and let it 
stew till tender; before serving, take oft" lie 
tape, thicken the gravy, and garnish with 
cut pickles. 

MUITON STEAKS, BROILED. Cut 

some mutton steaks from the loin, about 
half an inch thick, take off the skin, and part 
of the fat. As soon as the gridiron is hot, 
rub it with a little suet, lay on the steaks 
(place the gridiron over the fire aslant), turn 
the steaks frequently ; when they are done, 
put them into a hot dish, rub them with 
a little butter; slice a shallot very thin into 
a s|joonful of water, and pour it on them ; 
add a little ketchup ; garnish with scraped 
horse-radish, and pickles, and send them up 
hot to table.

NAPLES CURD. Put into a quart of 
new milk a stick of cinnamon, boil it a few 
mini:'' -, take out the cinnamon, and stir in 
eight well-beaten eggs, and a table-spoonful 
of white wine ; when it boils again, strain 
it through a sieve ; beat the curd in a basin, 
together with about half an ounce of butter, 
two table-spoonfuls of orange-flower water, 
and pounded sugar sufficient to sweeten it. 
Put it into a mould fur two hours before it 
is sent to table. White wine, sugar, and 
cream, may be mixed together, and poured 
round the curd ; or it may be served in a 
sauce tureen. 

NASTURTIUMS PICKLED. As soon 
as the blossoms are off, gather the little 
knobs; put them into cold water with some 
salt; shift them once a day for three suc- 
cessive days ; make a cold pickle of white 
wine vinegar, a little white wine, shallot, 
pepper, cloves, mace, nutmeg, cut in quar- 
horse-radish ; and put your nastur- 
tium buik into this pickle. 

NEAT'S TONGUE FRESH, IK A 
PLAIN WAY. Lard a tongue with tolera- 
ble-sized lardons, and boil it in broth, or in 
water, with a few onions and roots; when 
it is done, peel it, and serve it with broth, 
sprinkling it over with a little pepper and 
salt; it is also used without larding, and 
being boiled fresh in this manner, is consid- 
ered very good for mince-pie meat. 

NEAT'S TONGUE, ROASTED, A LA 
FRASCAISE. Boil a neat's tongue, and 
Lhnrh it ; set it by til! it is cold, then cut a 
hole in ill-- under part, and take out the 
meat, mince it with two or three hard eggs, 
an apple, beef-suet, and bacon; season with 
salt, Ix-aten ginger, and sweet herbs, shred 
\cry fine; stuff the tongue with this force- 
meat ; then cover the end with a veal caul, 
lard it with bacon, and roast it ; serve with 
a sauce made of gravy, butter, and the juice 
of oranges, garnish the dish with sliced Jem- 
on-peel and barberries. 

NOUGAT. Blanch and wash a pound 
of sweet almond.*, and ha\ ing drained them 
well, cut each into five slips, which place in 
a gentle oven to dry ; let them be all equally 
colored of a clear yellow ; in the meantime, 
put three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar 
into a preserving pan, set it on a stove, stir- 
ring with a wooden spoon until completely 
dissolved ; then take the almonds out of the 
oven, and whil.it hot throw them into the li- 
quid sugar; mix them together well. I In, 
lady a mould well oiled, of any hhape you 



think proper, in the interior of which place 
the slips of almonds, by means of lemon-juice, 
when the whole is covered, remove the mould 
carefully, and serve the Nougat. 

NOYAU. (1) Peaches and nectarines, 
in equal quantities, are to be bruised, die 
stones broken, and the kernels blanched and 
bruised ; they are then to be put into a jar 
in layers, one of fruit, one of kernels, and 
one of pounded loaf sugar, and so on until 
the jar is full; as much white brandy is 
then to be added as the jar will hold; and 
when it has stood for five or six montlis, it 
is to be filtered and bottled for use. 

NOYAU. (2) One pound of bitter al- 
monds, blanched, is to be steeped three 
months in four quarts of large-still proof 
whisky, or pale brandy, four pounds of loaf 
sugar are then to be clarified and added to 
the strained or filtered spirits, together with 
half a pint of pure honey. It is sometimes 
colored with a little cochineal; and may 
also be made, allowing three parts of sweet, 
and one of bitter almond*. 

NOYAU. (3) The rinds of three large 
lemons, half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, 
one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and 
|x>undfid, are to be mixed into a quart of the 
best Hollands gin, three table-spoonfuls of 
tailing milk being added. It is to be put 
into a bottle or jar, and shaken every day 
for three weeks, and then filtered through 
chamois leather or blotting paper, when it 
will be fit for use. 



O. 



OAT CAKES are made in the same 
manner as muffins, using sifted oatmeal in- 
stead of flour, and three gallons of water in- 
stead of two: pull the dough into pieces, 
roll and finish the cakes as directed for muf- 
fins. When wanted, pull the edges apart, 
toast them nicely on both sides, and dien 
open them completely; lay in small piece* 
of butter, until you have as much as}ou may 
want; close them again, set them before 
die fire, and cut each in halves or quarters. 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. Boil some 
\\.id r iii' a saucepan with a little salt, and 
stir oatmeal into it with a thevil; when of 
a proper thickness, let it boil for four or 
five minutes, stirring it all the time; then 
pour it into a dish, and serve widi it cream 
or milk. It is sometimes eaten with porter 
and sugar, or ale and sugar. If made with 
milk instead of water, less meal is requisite, 
and it is then eaten with cold milk. 



OME

OLIVE ROYALS. Boil one pound of 
potatoes, and when nearly cold rub them 
perfectly smooth with four ounces of flour 
and one ounce of butter, and knead it to- 
gether till it become a paste; roll it out 
about a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into 
rounds, and lay upon one side any sort of 
cold roasted meat cut into thin small bits, 
and reasoned with pepper and salt ; put a 
very small bit of butter over it, wet the 
edges, and close the paste in the form of a 
half circle. Fry them in boiling fresh drip- 
ping of a light brown color ; lay them be- 
fore the fire, on the back of a sieve, to drain. 
Serve them with or without gravy in the 
dish. For a change, mince the meat, and 
season it as before directed. The potatoes 
should be very mealy. 

OLIVES. There are three sorts, the 
Italian, Spanish, and French; they may 
be had of various sizes and flavors, some 
prefer one sort, and some another. 

The fine salad oil is made from this fruit, 
for which pui-|x>se they are gathered ripe; 
for pickling they are gathered when only 
half ripe, at the latter end of June ; they are 
put into fresh water to soak for a couple of 
days ; after this they are thrown into lime- 
water, in which some pearl-ashes have been 
dissolved ; in this liquor they lie for six and 
thirty hours ; they are then put into water 
which has had bay-salt dissolved in it; this 
is die last preparation, and they are sent 
over to us in this liquor; they are naturally, 
as they grow on the tree, extremely bitter, 
and therefore all these preparations are nec- 
essary to bring them to their fine flavor. To 
some olives they add a small quantity of es- 
sence of spices, which is an oil drawn from 
cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and 
sweet fennel-seed distilled together for that 
purpose ; twelve drops are sufficient for a 
bushel of olives ; some prefer them flavored 
with this essence. 

OMELETS AND VARIOUS WATS 

OF DRESSING EGGS. There is no dish 
which may be considered as coming under 
the denomination of a made dish of die sec- 
ond order, which is so generally eaten, if 
good, as an omelet; and no one is so often 
badly dressed : it is a very faithful assistant 
in the construction of a dinner. 

When you are taken by surprise^nd wish 
to make an appearance beyond what is pro- 
vided for the every-day dinner, a little port- 
able soup melted down, and some zest and a 
few vegetables, will make a good broth ; a 
pot of stewed veal warmed up ; an omelet ; 
and some apple or lemon fritters, can all be 
got ready at ten minutes notice, ami with 
the original foundation of a leg of mutton, or 
a piece of beef, will make up a very good 



dinner when company unexpectedly arrives, 
in the country. 

The great merit of an omelet is, that it 
should not be- greasy, burnt, nor too much 
done: if too much of the white of the eggs is 
left in, no ait can prevent its l>eing hard, if 
it is done: to dress the omelet, the fire 
should not be too hot, as it is an object to 
have the whole substance heated, without 
much browning the outside. 

One of the great errors in cooking an om- 
elet is, that it is too thin; consequently, in- 
stead of feeling full and moist in the mouth, 
the substance presented is little better than 
a piece of fried leather: to get the omelet 
thick is one of the great objects. With re- 
spect to the flavors to be introduced, these 
are infinite; that which is most common, 
however, is the best, viz. finely chopped 
parsley, and chives or onions, or eschalots: 
however, one made of a mixture of tarragon, 
chervil, and parsley, is a very delicate va- 
riety, omitting or adding the onion or chives. 
Of the meat flavors, the veal kidney is the 
most delicate, and is the most admired by 
the French: this should be cut in dice, and 
should be dressed (boiled) before it is added; 
in the same manner, ham and anchovies, 
shred small, or tongue, will make a *ery 
delicately flavored dish. 

The objection to an omelet is, that it is 
too rich, which makes it advisable to eat 
but a small quantity. An addition of some 
finely mashed potatoes, about two table- 
spoonfuls, to an omelet of six eggs, will 
much lighten it. 

Omelets are often served with rich gra- 
vy ; but, as a general principle, no substance 
which has been fried should be served in gra- 
w, but accompanied by it, or what ou^ht to 
eat dry and crisp, becomes soddened and 
flat. 

In the compounding die gravy, great care 
should be taken dial the flavor does not over- 
come that of the omelet, a thing too little 
attended to: a fine gravy, with a honoring 
of sweet herbs and onions, we think the l>est ; 
some add a few drops of tarragon vinegar; 
but this is to be done only with great care: 
gravies to omelets are in general thicken- 
ed: diis should never be done with (lour; 
potato starch, or arrow-root, is the best. 

Omelets should be fried in a small fry- 
ing-pan made for dial purpose, with a small 
quantity of butter. The omelet' 
merit is to be diick, so as not to taste of the 
outside; therefore use only half die number 
of whites that you do yolks of eggs : every 
care must be taken in frying, even at the 
risk of not having it ([iiite set in die middle: 
an omelet, which has so much vogue 
abroad, is here, in general, a dlin doubled- 
up piece of leadier, and harder dian soft 
leadier sometimes. The fact is, diat as much

care murt be bestowed on the frying, as 
should be taken in poaching an egg. A 
salamander is necessary to those who will 
have the lop brown ; lx.it the- kitchen shovel 

may be MI!M itnted for it. 

The followim: receipt is tlie basis of all 
omelets, of which you may make an end- 
less variety, by taking, instead of the pars- 
ley and eschalot, a portion of sweet herbs, 
or any of the articles used for making force- 
meats, or any of the forcemeats. 

- are callml by the name of what 
is added to flavor them: a ham or tongue 
onii-let ; an anchovy, or veal kidney ome- 
let, Sic.: the* 1 are prepared exactly in the 
sunn- way a. in the first receipt, leaving out 
the pai>le\ ami eschalot, and mincing the 
ham in- kidnev very tine, See., and adding 
that in the place of them, and then pour over 
them all sorts of thickened gravies, sauces, 
&c. 

OMKLET. (1) Five or six eggs will 
make a good-sized omelet; break them 
into a li.i-ni. and Beat them well with a fork ; 
and add a salt-s|xMinful of salt; have ready 
two drachms of onion, or three 
drachms of parsley, a good clove of e-chalot 
miiired very line; beat it well up with the 
eg>; then take four ounces of fresh butter, 
and lireak half of it into large bits, and put 
it into tin- omelet, and the other half into 
a very clean fi s ing-pan ; when it is melted, 
pour in die omelet, and stir it with a spoon 
till it begins to set, then turn it up all round 
the edges, and when it is of a nice brown it 
is done: the safest way to take it out is to 
put a plait: on tin- omelet, and turn the pan 
ii|i:-ide-d'iwii: serve it on a hot dish; it 
should never t>e dune till just wanted. If 
maigre, grated cheese, shrimps, m 
If oy-lers, lx.il them tour minutes, and take 
awav tin- lieard ami nri.-ily part; tliey may 
cither be put in whole, or cut in bits. 

OMKLET. (2) Beard and parboil twelve 
or sixteen oysters, seasoning them with a few 

|n-p|H i corns, .-.train and chop them; beat 
well >ix eggs; (Kirlxjil and mince a little 
par.- lex ; mix all together, and season with a 
little nutmeg, salt, and a (able-spoonful of 
iiiu>hi-iHim ketchup; fry il lightly in three 
i I Miller, and hold it for a minute or 
two U't'ore the fire. 

OMKLET. (S) Beat well and nti.im-i\ 

"Id them to three ounces of butter 

made hot ; mix in s iim- sjrale.l ham, pepper, 

sail, and nutmeg, some chopped chives and 

]vir>le\. l-'iy it of a light brown color. 



some salt and chopped parsley; then beat 
them well, and season them according to 
taste, then have ready some onion chopped 
small ; put some butter into a fry inn-pan, and 
when it is hot (but not to burn) put in your 
chopped onion, giving them two or three 
turns ; then add your eggs to it, and fry the 
whole of a nice brown, you must only fry 
one side. When done, turn it into a dish, 
the fried side uppermost, and serve. 

OMELET FRITTERS. Make two or 
three thin omelets, adding a little sweet ba- 
sil to the usual ingredients; cut them into 
small pieces and roll them into the form of 
olives; when cold, dip them into batter, or 
enclose them in puff paste; fry, and serve 
them with fried parsley. 

OMELET WITH KIDNEY OF 
VEAL. To eight well-beaten eggs, add a 
litile salt, and part of a cold roasted kidney 
of veal, finely minced; season with pepper, 
and a little more salt ; melt in a fryinu-pan 
one ounce and a half of butter, and pour in 
the omelet ; fry it gently, and keep the mid- 
dle |>art moist ; when done, roll it equally 
u|Kiii a knife, and serve it very hot. 

OMELET AU NATUREL. Break 
eight or ten eggs into a pan, add pepper, 
salt, and a spoonful of cold water, beat them 
up with a whisk; in the meantime put some 
fresh butter into a frying-pan, when it is quite 
melted and nearly boiling, put in the eggs,

up the edges, that they may be properly 
done; when cooked, double it; serve \.rv 
hot. 

ONIONS. The small round silver button 
onions, about as big as a nutme<;. make a 
very nice pickle. Take off their topcoats, 
have n adv a stew pan, three pails tilled w ith 
boiling water, into which put as many on- 
ions as will cover the (op: as soon as they 
look clear, immc-diately take them up with 
| a spoon full of holes, and lay them on a cloth 
i three times folded, and cover them with 
another till \oii have ready as many as, you 
wish: when they are quite dry, put them into 
I jars, and cover them with hot pickle, made 
i by infixing an ounce of horseradish, same of 
allspire, and same of lilack [x-pppr, and same 
of salt, in a quart of best white-wine vinegar, 
in a stone jar, on a trivet by the side of tlic 
I fire for three days, keeping it well closed ; 
when cold, bun;; them down tight, and cover 
them with bladder wetted with the pickle 
and lea I her. 



OMKLKT. (4) Take as many eggs as OMONS STKXVKI). The large Por- 
you think prnjier (according to the size of tuiral onions are the U-st: take oft the top- 
vour omrlet) break them into a basin with ' coats of half a dozen of these (taking care

not to cut off the tops or tails too near, or 
the onions will go to pieces), and put them 
into a ste\v|n broad enough to hold them 
without laying them atop of one another, 
and just cover diem with good broth. Put 
them over a slow fire, and let them simmer 
about two hours; when yon dish them, turn 
them upside down, and pour the sauce over. 

ONIONS TO PICKLE. Peel the onions 
till they look white; boil some strong salt 
and water, and pour it over them ; let them 
stand in this twenty-four hours, keep die 
vessel closely covered to retain die steam: 
after that time wipe die onions quite dry, 

and when they are cold, pour boiling vinegar, 

. . . * . i. 
with singer and white pepper over them. 

Take care the vinegar always covers the 
onions. 

ONION SAUCE, YOUNG. Peel a 

pint of button onions, and put diem in water 
till you want to put diem on to boil; put 
them into a stewpan, with a quart of cold 
water; let them boil till tender; diey will 
take (according to their size and age) from 
half an hour to an hour. 

ONION SAUCE. Those who like the 
full flavor of onions only cut off die strings 
and tops (without peeling off any of the 
skins), put diem into salt and water, and let 
diem lie an hour; then wash them, put them 
into a kettle with plenty of water, and boil 
them till diey are tender: now skin them, 

!>ass them through a colander, and mix a 
ittle melted butter widi diem. N. B. Some 
mix the pulp of apples, or turnips, widi die 
onions, others add mustard to diem. 

ONIONS, TO PREPARE FOR SEA- 
SONING. Peel and mince three or four 
onions, put them into a saucepan with a lit- 
tle cold water. Let diem lil till (|iiite 
tender, and then pulp diem with the liquor 
through a hair sieve, when it may be mixed 
widi any made dishes or sauces. 

ONIONS YOUNG, TO PICKLE. 

Choose some of the small silver onions, put 
them on in cold water, and when it is scald- 
ing hot, take them out with an egg slice; 
peel off die skins till they look white and 
clear; lay them into the folds of a cloth. 
Boil, in a quart of vinegar, half an ounce of 
pepper, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, die 
same of garlic, and one sliced nutmeg; put 
tin- onions into a jar, and pour over them 
the boiling vinegar and spices. When cold, 
tie leather over die jar. 

ONIONS, PLAIN BOILED. Peel 
them, and let them lie an hour in fold water, 
put them on in bo i I'm!; milk and water; 



boil diem till tender, and cerve diem with

ONIONS, ROAST. Roast them with 
the skins on in a Dutch oven, that they may- 
brown equally. They are eaten with cold 
fresh butter, pep|>er, and salt. 

ONIONS STEWED. (1) Take a dozen 

of good-sized onions, |>eel and put them on 
in the following sauce : A pint of veal si< n-k , 
a bit of butler rolled in flour, a little pep|ier, 
and salt. Stew them gently for an hour, 
and, just before serving, mix in three table- 
spoonfnls of cream. To stew them in a 
brown sauce, take die same quantity of good 
gravy. In a stewpan brown, of a li . 
lor, a little butter and flour, add tin- ui,i\y 
and onions, with a little pepper and salt, anil 
stew diem gendy one hour. 

ONIONS STEWED. (2) Peel five or

ORANGE SIRUP, FOR PUNCH OR 
PUDDING. See Juttict. 



ORANGEADE. (1) Squeeze the juice; 
pour some lx>iling water on the peel, and 
cover it closely ; Ixiil water and sugar to a 
thin simp, and skim it ; when all are cold, 
mix the juice, tin: infusion, and tlie sirup, 
with as much water as will make a rich 
sherlx-t ; strain it through a jelly-bag. 

ORANGEADE. (2) This refreshing 
beverage is made precisely in the same man- 
ner as lemonade, only substituting oranges 
for lemons. 

ORANGE PEEL RATAFIA. Put 

the peels of a dozen thick-skinned oranges 
into a gallon of brandy ; dissolve two pounds 
of sugar in the juice of the oranges, add to it 
the brandy, and having stirred them togeth- 
er well, close the vessel tightly, and leave it 
for a month ; then strain it off, and bottle it. 

ORGEAT. (1) Pound very fine one 
pound of Jordan, and one ounce of bitter, 
almonds, in a marble mortar, with halt" a gill 
of oranu'e-tlower water to keep them from 
oiling; then mix with ihein one pint of 
rose and one pint of spring-water ; rub it 
through a tamis cloth or lawn sieve, till the 
almonds are quite dry, which will reduce the 
quantity to about a quart : have ready three 
pints of clarified sugar or water, and boil it 
to a iT.ick (which' may be known by dipping 
your fingers into tlie sugar, and then into 
cold water ; and if you find the sugar to crack 
in moving your finger, it has boiled enough) ; 
put in the almonds; boil it one minute, and 
when cold put it into small bottles close 
corked; a table-spoonful of which will be 
sufficient for a tumbler of water: shake the 
Ix.ttk- Ix-lore using. If the orgeat is for 
present use, the almonds may l)e [xiunded as

or short crust, requires a slower oven; pe- 
tits-bhoux, one still slower; hut for raised 
pies, let it be as hot as for puff-paste at first, 
and well closed, so that the pies may not fall. 
Therefore, when you give a dinner where 
pnste is necessary, endeavor to make it in 
the morning; heat your oven first for the 
puff-paste, which must be baked the first; 
then let the oven go gradually down, and 
bake your pastes in rotation, as the heat 
falls. Savoy biscuits require a cool oven, 
and, by degrees, raise the heal as die biscuits 
are baking. For souffles or light puddings, 
have a gentle oven, and contrive BO as to have 
them ready by the time they are wanted, or 
they will fall. The greatest attention should 
also be paid in heating the oven for baking 



cakes, particularly for those that are large. 
If not pretty quick, die batter will not rise. 
Should you fear its catching by being too 
quick, put paper over the cake to prevent its 
being burnt. If not long enough lighted to 
have a body of heat, or if it has become 
slack, the cake will be heavy. To know 
when it is soaked, take a broad bladed 
knife that is very bright, and plunge it into 
the centre ; draw it instantly out, and if the 
least stickiness adheres, put the cake imme- 
diately in, and shut up the oven. Il'ihe heat 
was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, fresh 
fuel must be quickly put in, and the cakes 
kept hot until die oven is fit to finish the 
soaking, but this must only be done in a ease 
of great emergency; for those who are em- 
ployed ought to be particularly careful dial 
no mistake occur from negligence. 

OX-CHEEK STEWED. Prepare this 
the day before it is to be eaten ; clean it, and 
put it into soft water just warm; let it lie 
dirce or four haul's, then put it into cold wa- 
ter, and let it soak all night; next day wipe 
it clean, put it into a stewpan, and just cover 
it with water; skim it well when it is com- 
ing to a boil, then put two whole onions, 
stick two or diree cloves into each, three 
turnips quartered, a couple of carrots sliced, 
two bay-leaves, and twenty-four corns of all- 
spice, a head of celery, and a bundle of 
sweet-herbs, pepper, and salt ; to these, 
those who are for a " haut gout " may add 
cayenne and garlic, in such proportion as 
tiii palate that requires them may desire. 
Let it stew gently till perfectly tender, t. e. 
about three hom-s; then take out die cheek, 
divide it into handsome pieces, fit to Help at 
table; skim, and strain the gravy; melt an 
ounce and a half of butter in a slew pan ; M ir 
into it as much flour as it will take up; mix 
with it by degrees a pint and a half of the 
gravy ; add to it a table-spoonful of basil, 
tarragon, or elder vinegar, or die like quan- 
tity of mushroom or walnut ketchup, or cav- 
ice, or Port wine, and give it a boil. 



OX CHEEK, TO BOIL. Wash very 
clean, half a head; let it lie in cold water 
all night; break the bone in two, taking care 
not to break the flesh. Put it on in a pot 
of boiling water, and let it l>oil from two to 
three hours; take out the bone. Serve it 
widi boiled carrots and turnips, or savoys. 
The liquor the head has been boiled in may 
be strained and made into Scots barley broth, 
or Scots kale. 

OX FEET JELLY. Put a little hot 
water over the top of the stock, pour it off, 
and wi|>e it dry with a clean cloth ; put a 
quart of it into a saucepan with the beaten 
whites of five or six eggs, the juice of five 
lemons made very sweet with good brown 
sugar, a clove or two, and a little cinna- 
mon pounded; let it boil twenty minutes, 
stirring it all the time ; take it off the fire, 
and add a pint, or half a pint of white 
\vine, and run it through a jelly-bag till 
clear. 

OX-TAILS STEWED. Divide them 
into joints; wash them; parboil them; set 
them on to stew in just water enough to 
cover them, and dress them in the same 
manner as we have directed in Stewed Gib- 
lets, for which diey are an excellent substi- 
tute. 

OYSTERS. Some piscivorous gour- 
mands diink that oysters are not best when 
quite fresh from their l>eds, and that their 
flavor is too brack isli and harsh, and is much 
ameliorated by giving diem a feed. 

To FEED oysters. diver them with 
clean water, with a pint of salt to alxnit two 
gallons (nothing else, no oatmeal, flour, nor 
any other trumpery); this will cleanse them 
from the mud and sand, &c. of the bed ; af- 
ter they have lain in it twelve hours, change 
it for fresh salt and water, and in twelve 
hours more they will be in prime order for 
the mouth, and remain so two or three days: 
at the time of hi<jh water you may see them 
open their shells, in expectation of receiving 
their usual food. This process of li cding 
oysters is only employed when a gn-a! many 
come up together. 

Common |>eople are indifferent about the 
manner of opening oysters, and the time of 
eating them after they are opened ; nothing, 
however, is more important in the enlight- 
ened eyes of die experienced oyster-eater. 

Those who wish to enjoy this delicious 
restorative in its utmost perfection, must 
eat it the moment it is opened, with its own 
gravy in the under shell ; if not eaten while 
absolutely alive, its flavor and spirit are lost. 

Shell-iish have' long held a high rank in 
the catalogue of easily digestible and sjieedi- 
ly restorative foods; of these the oy=ter cer-

tainly deserves the best character, but we 
think it has acquired not a little more repu- 
tation for th<M- qualities than it de^ 
well-die-* '1 chop or sneak, will imigorate 
the heart in a much higher ratio; to recruit 
the animal spirits, and sup|>ort 
there is nothing equal to animal tood; when 
kept till pnnx'iK tender, none will give so 
little trouble to flic- digestive organs, .mil s.i 
much ;iibs.tantial excitement to the constitu- 
tion. 

< IYSTKU ATTELETS. Cut into small 
pieces a sweetbread and a slice or two of 
bacon, U-ard some large oysters, and season 
all liighlv with chopped parsley, shallot, a 
little tin me, [vp[-r and salt. Then fasten 
them alternately upon wire skewers; put 
sifted bread crumbs over them, and broil or 
fry them of a light brown color. Take them 
oft' tint skewers, and serve them with some 
rich gravy, to which add a little ketchup and 
lemon pickle. 

OYSTERS, BAKED. Grate a small 

loaf of ,-tal'- In. -ad. Butteradeep dish well, 
and i "\' r the sides and bottom with bread 
crumbs. 1'ut in half the oysters with a lit- 
and pepper. Cover tliem with 
nl small bits of butter strewed over 
tJicm. Then put in the remainder of the 
oysters. Season them. Cover them as 
U-f ire with crumbs and butter. If the oys- 
ters are fresh pour in tlie liquor. If they 
are salt, substitute a little water. Bake it a 
ver\ short time. 

OYSTERS, FRIED. (1) Make a batter 

as fur pancakes, seasoned with grit. ! nut- 
meg, white pepper, and salt, and add sonic 
finely grati-d bread crnmlis; dip in the oys- 
ters, and fry them of a light brown in beef 
jrippi 

Another way is, to dip them into the white 
of an egg beat up, and roll diem in finely 
grated bread crumbs, seasoned with grated 
nutmeg, [>epix.-r ami salt, and fry them as 
directed. 

<nsTERS, FRIED. (2) The largest 
and Hnest oysters are to be chosen for this 
: -imnier them ill their own liquor 
l : i a couple of minutes, take them out and 
lay them on a cloth to drain, beard them and 
dien flour them, egg and bread-crumb them, 
put them into boiling fat, and fry them a 
delicate brown. Ob*. An elegant garnish 
for made dishes, stewed rump-steaks, boiled 
or fried li.-h, Sic.; but they are too hard and 
dry to be eaten. 

OY-TI'KS, FRIED. (3) For frying, 
choose the largest and finest oysters. Beat 
ome yolki of eggs, and mix. with them grat- 



ed bread, and a small quantity of beaten 
nnt:n.-_' and mace, and a little salt. Hav- 
ing t-tirred this batter well, dip your oys- 
ters into it, and fry them in lard, till they 
are of a light brown color. Take- 
to do them too much. Serve them up hot. 
For grated bread, some substitute ei ackers 
|xnim!ed to a powder, and mixed with yolk 
of egg and spice. 

OYSTERS, TO KEEP AND FAT- 
TEN. Put them into water, and wa-h and 
clean them with a birch broom ; lav ing diem 
with the deep shell downwards into a tub or 
broad platter, and then .-prink le them o\ei w ith 
salt. The follow-in;; day pour over them and 
fill the vessel widi clean cold water, in which 
they must remain an hour, then pour it off 
again; sprinkle them with salt, and let this 
be repeated every day. This method will 
keep them good for a fortnight. 

OYSTER KETCHUP. (1) Take 

line frc.-h o\strrs; wash them in -their own 
liquor; skim it; pound them in a marble 
mortar; to a pint of o\sters add a pint of 
Sherry; boil them up, ami add an ounce of 
silt, two drachms of ponded mace, and one 
of cayenne; k-t it just boil up again; skim 
it, and nib it through a sieve, and when cold, 
bottle it, cork it well, and seal it down. 

.\. 15. It is the l>esi way to pound the salt 
and spices, Jkc. with the oysters. 

Obs. This composition very agreeably 
heightens the flavor of white sauces, and 
white made-dishes; and if you add a glass 
of brandy to it, it will keep good for a consi- 
derable time longer than oysters are out of 
season. 

OYSTER KETCHUP. (2) Boil one 
hundred oysters with tlieir liquor, till the 
strength be extracted from them; strain them 
well, and add to the liquor an equal quanti- 
ty of wine, one half Port and the other 
Sherry, also a quarter of an ounce of mace, 
die same of white pepper and of allspice, a 
dr.icliiu or lea-spoonful of ginger, and six 
- ; boil all together about fifteen 
minute-*. Put into ajar twelve shallots, tlie 
l-i I oi'a lemon, and a piece of horse-radish 
cut small; pour upon diem the boiling li- 
quor, and when cold, bottle it, together with 
die spices. 

OYSTER LOAVES. Cut off the top 
of some small French rolls, take out the 
crumb, and fry them brown and crisp with 
clarified Imlter, tln-n fry some bread crumbs; 
stew tin; requisite quantity of oysters, beard- 
ed and cut in two, in their fiquor, with a 
littli- white wine, some gravy, and seasoned 
with grated lemon-peel, pounded mace, pep- 
per, and salt ; add a bit of butter ; fill the

rolls with the oysters, and serve them with 
the fried bread crumbs in the dish. 

OYSTER PATTIES. (1) Roll out puff 
paste a quarter of an incli thick, cut it into 
squares with a knife, sheet eight or ten patty 
pans, put upon each a bit of bread die size 
of half a walnut ; roll out another layer of 
paste of the same thickness, cut it as above, 
wet die edge of die bottom paste, and put 
on die top, pare diem round to die pan, and 
notch them about a dozen times with die 
back of the knife, rub them lightly with yolk 
of egg, bake them in a hot oven about a 
quarter of an hour: when done, take a thin 
slice off the top, dien, with a small knife or 
spoon, take out die bread and the inside 
paste, leaving die outside quite entire ; then 
parboil two dozen of large oysters, strain 
them from their liquor, wash, beard, and cut 
them into four, put them into a stewpan 
with an ounce of butter rolled in flour, half 
a gill of good cream, a little grated lemon- 
peel, die oyster liquor, free from sediment, 
reduced by boiling to one half, some cayenne 
pepper, salt, and a tea-spoonfiil of lemon- 
juice ; stir it over a fire five .minutes, and 
fill die patties. 

OYSTER PATTIES. (2) Make some 
rich puff paste, and bake it in very small tin 
patty-pans. When cool, turn diem out upon 
a large i^ish. Stew some large fresh oysters 
widi a few cloves, a little mace and nutmeg, 
some yolk of egg boiled hard and grated, a 
little butter, and as much of the oyster liquor 
as will cover them. When they have stew- 
ed a little while, take diem out of die pan, 
arid set diem away to cool. When quite 
cold, lay two or three oysters in each shell 
of puff-paste. 

OYSTER PIE. Beard a quart of fine 
oysters, strain die liquor, and add diem to 
it. Cut into thin slices the kidney fat of a 
loin of veal; season diem with while pep- 
per, salt, mace, and grated lemon-peel ; lay 
diem on the bottom of a pie dish, put in die 
oysters and liquor, with a little more season- 
ing ; put over diem die marrow of two bones. 
Lay a border of puff paste round die edge of 
die dish ; cover it with paste, and bake it 
pearly three-quarters of an hour. 

OYSTERS, PRESERVED. Open 

the oysters carefully, so as not to cut diem 
except in dividing the gristle which attaches 
the shells; put diem into a mortar, anc 
when you have got as many as you can con- 
veniently pound at once, add about two 
drachms of salt to a dozen oysters ; pounc 
diem, and jrub diem through die back of a 
hair sieve, and put diem into a mortar again 
with as much flour (which has been pre- 



viously thoroughly dried) as will make diem 
into a paste ; roll it out several times, and, 
lastly, flour it, and roll it out die thickness 
of a half-crown, and divide it into pieces 
about an inch square; lay them in a Dutch 
oven, where diey will dry so gently as not to 
get burnt: turn them every half hour, and 
when they begin to dry, crumble diem ; diey 
will take about four hours to dry; dien 
pound them fine, sift them, and put diem 
into bottles and seal diera over. 

N. B. Three dozen required seven and a 
half ounces of dried flour to make them into 
a paste which then weighed eleven ounces; 
when dried and powdered, six and a quar- 
ter ounces. 

To make half a pint of sauce, put one 
ounce of butter into a stewpan with three 
drachms of oyster powder, and six table- 
spoonfuls of milk ; set it on a slow fire; stir 
it till it boils, and season it with salt. 

This powder, if made with plump, juicy 
oysters, will abound with the flavor of die 
fish; and if closely corked, and kept in a 
dry place, will remain good for sometime. 

This extract is a welcome succedaneum 
while oysters are out of season, and in such 
inland paits as seldom have anv, is a valua- 
ble addition to die list of fish sauces: it is 
equally good widi boiled fowl, or rump steak, 
and sprinkled on bread and butter makes a 
very good sandwich, and is especially wor- 
thy the notice of country housekeepers, and 
as a store sauce for die army and navy. 

OYSTERS, TO PICKLE. Open diem 
carefully, preserving all their liquor; put 
them into a saucepan over die fire, stirring 
them now and then, and when die liquor 
boils take diem off, skim die surface, and 
put die oysters into a bowl ; let die liquor 
settle, pour off die clear part, and put it on

an ounce of whole black pepper, a litde 
mace and allspice ; boil it ten minutes, dien 
add die oysters, and let diem boil two min- 
utes ; put diem into a jar, and when diey 
are cold, tie a paper over it. 

' OYSTER SAUCE. When your oys- 
ters are opened, take care of all the liquor 
and give diem one boil in it. Then take 
die oysters out, and put to die liquor diree 
or four blades of mace. Add to it some 
melted butter, and some thick cream or 
rich milk. Put in your oysters and give 
diem a boil.

marjoram and other pot-herbs. Wbeo ii 
boili add a quart of rich milk and as soon 
as it boils again take out the herl*-, and 
put in die oysters just before you send it to 
table. 

OYSTER SOUP. (2) Boil in water the 
crumb of two twopenny roll-*, with a few blades 
of mure, a tea-spoonful of whole while pop- 
per, and lour onions cut small. Pick out 
the spice, and nib the bread and unions

tal>le->|xioutul of Hour, and. mix it gradually 
with half a pint of the soup, and then stir all 
well together. When it has boiled a short 
time, add with the liquor half a hundred or 
more of fine oysters, and let the whole sim- 
mer for ten or fifteen minutes. If the soup 
is not quite salt enough with the liquor of 
the "\-iii-, a little salt may be added. 

OYSTERS SCALLOPED. (1) Put 
them, with their liquor strained, two or three 
blades of m i< e. a lew peppercorns, a little 
cayenne, and a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, kneaded with Hour, into a stewpan.

or three minutes, take them out with a spoon, 
lieard them, ami -kim the liquor, put. a bit 
of butter into a slew|>an; when it is melted, 
add as much fine bread-crumbs as will dry

more oysters; moisten it with die oyster li- 



quor, cover them with bread-crumbs, put 
about half a dozen little bits of butter on the 
top of each, and brown them in a Dutch ov- 
en. Essence of anchovy, ketchup, cayenne, 
grated lemon-peel, mace, and other spices, 
&c. are added by those who prefer piquance 
to the genuine flavor of the oyster. 

Cold fish may be re-dressed the same way 
N. B. Small scallop-shells, or saucers that 
hold about half a dozen oysters, are the most 
convenient. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (1) Stew with 
a quart of oysters, and their liquor strained, 
a glass of white wine, one anchovy bruised, 
seasoned with white pepper, salt, a little 
mace, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; let all 
Blew gently a quarter of an hour. Pick out 
the bunch of herbs, and add a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter kneaded in a large ta- 
ble-spoonful of flour, and stew them ten or 
twelve minutes. Serve them garnished with 
bread-sippets and cut lemon. They may be 
stewed simply in their own liquor, seasoned 
with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, and 
thickened with cream, flour, and butter. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (2) Open the 
oysters and strain the liquor. Put to them 
some grated stale bread, and a little pepper 
and nutmeg. Throw them into the liquor, 
and add a glass of white wine. Let them 
stew but a very short time, or thev will I*- 
hard. Have ready some slices of buttered 
toast with tlie crust off. When the oysters 
are done, dip the toast in die liquor, and 
lay the pieces round the sides and in the 
bottom of a deep dish. Pour the oysters and 
liquor upon the toast and send them to ta- 
ble hot. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (3) Large oys- 
ters will do for stewing, and by some are pre- 
ferred. Stew a couple of dozen of these in 
their own liquor; when they are coming to a 
I xiil,.. kim well, take them up and beard them; 
strain the liquor through a tamis-sieve, and 
lay the oysters on a dish. Put an ounce of 
butter into a stewpan ; when it is melted, 
pit to it as, much Hour as will dry it up, the 
liquor of the oysters, and three table-spoon- 
fuls of milk or cream, and a little white pep- 
per and salt ; to this some cooks add a little 
ketchup, or finely-chopped parsley, grated 
lemon-peel, and juice; let it boil up for a 
couple of minutes, till it is smooth, tlien take 
it off tlie fire, put in the oysters, and let them 
get warm (iliey must not tliemselves be boil- 
ed, or they will become hard) ; line the bot- 
tom and sides of a lia.-h-di-h with bread- 
sippets, and |xmr your oysters and sauce 
into it.

PALATES AND SWEETBREADS. 

Boil the palates till the black skin can be 
easily peeled off; parboil the sweetbreads 
with tlirin ; skin and cut the palates into 
pieces, and if the sweetbreads are large, cut 
them in two the long way ; dust them with 
flour, and fry them of a light brown, in but- 
ter; then stew them in rather more than a 
pint of the liquor in which they were boiled. 
Brown a piece of butter with flour; add 
it, with a little cayenne, salt, pep|>er, grated 
lemon-peel, and nutmeg, and a glass of white 
wine. A little before serving, stir in a 
spoonful of vinegar, or die squeeze of a lem- 



PANADA. (1) Boil some pieces of stale | 
bread in a sufficient quantity of cold water 
to cover them, with a little cinnamon, lemon- 
peel, and caraways; when the bread is quite 
soft, press out all the water, and beat up die 
bread widi a small piece of butter, a little 
milk, and sugar to die taste; a little spice 
may be added. 

PANADA. (2) Set a little water on 
the fire wid) a glass of white wine, some su- 
gar, a very little nutmeg, and lemon-peel ; 
meanwhile grate seme crumbs of bread: die 
moment die water boils up, put in the bread- 
crumbs (without taking it off die fire), and 
let it boil as fast as it can. When of a 
proper consistence, that is, when just of a 
sufficient thickness to drink, take it off die 
fire. 

PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. Break 
three eggs in a basin ; beat diem up widi a 
little nutmeg and salt ; then put to them four 
ounces and a half of flour, and a little milk ; 
beat it of a smooth batter ; dien add by de- 
grees as much milk as will make it of die 
thickness of good cream: the frying-pan muse 
be about die size of a pudding plate, and 
very clean, or diey will stick ; make it hot, 
and to each pancake put in a bit of butter 
about as big as a walnut: when it is melted, 
pour in the batter to cover the bottom of die 
pan; make diem die diickness, of half a 
crown; fry diem of a light brown on both 
sides. The above will do for apple fritteis, 
by adding one spoonful more of flour; peel 
your apples, and cut diem in thick slices ; 
take out die core, dip diem in die batter, 
and fry diem in hot lard; put diem on a 
sieve to drain ; dish them neatly, and grate 
some loaf-sugar over diem. 



PANCAKES IN APPLES. Cut some 
apples very small, stew them with a litde 
white wine, grated lemon-peel, pounded cin- 
namon, and brown eugar ; mash them, and

on-peel, nutmeg, jjepper, salt, and a little 
lemon pickle; warm it up with some good 
gravy, and a small bit of butter rolled in 
flour. Have i-eady a batter as for pancakes, 
seasoned widi a little salt and grated nutmeg. 
Fry a thin pancake, turn it, and put into 
the middle two table-spoonfuls of die minced 
veal ; fold it in at each side and at the ends 
in an oblong form, and fry them of a light 
brown color ; lay tliem upon the back of a 
sieve to drain before die fire. Four or six

corner or top dish. 

PANCAKES, SCOTCH. Mix with 
six table-spoonfuls of flour a little cream, add 
die beaten yolks of six cu'irs, and then mix in

P \IISl.r.Y. To preserve parsley through 
the winter: in May, June, or July, take, 
line fresh-gathered sprigs: pick, and wash 
them clean ; set on a stew pan half full of wa- 
ter; put a little salt in it; Ixiil, and skim it 
1. 1 then |>ut in the panley, and let it

PARSLEY, CRISP. Pick and wash 
young parsley, shake it in a dry cloth to 
drain the water from it ; spread it oir a sheet 
nf clean pa|xT in a I Hitch oven !> 
fire, and turn it frequently until it is quite 
crisp. This is a much more easy way of 
prepariiiii it than frying it, which is not sel- 
dom ill done. 

PARSNIPS, TO BOIL. Scrape and 

wash them nicely ; when large, divide them ; 
boil them in milk and water till quite tender; 
tliey will take nearly as long to boil as car- 
rots. They may also be mashed like tur- 
nips. 

PARTRIDGES, TO CHOOSE. When 
they are young the bill is of a dark color, 
and their legs are of a yellowish color; and 
when fresh, the vent is firm, but this part 
will look greenish when stale. The plumage 
on tlie breast of the hen la light, that on the 
cock is tinged with red. 

PARTRIDGES BROILED. Take 
five partridges, cut them in halves, trim and 
dip them in melted butter, and bread them 
twice ; a quarter of an hour before dinner 
broil them. 

PARTRIDGES MINCED. Take the 

fillets from eight roasted partridges, minre, 
and put them into a sattcepan ; make a light 
roux, in which put the livers and lights of 
the birds, a bay-leaf, a clove, three shallots, 
and a little sage, give them a few turns, anil 
tlien add two large glasses of stock, reduce 
the saire t.i half, strain and put it to the 
mince, stirring till it is thick and smooth; 
make it hot, but not boiling; serve it over 
fried bread, and garnish your dish, with 
either poached or hard eggs. 

PARTRIDGE IN BREAD. Take a 

nice shaped loaf, of about a pound weight ; 
make a hole at one end, through which lake 
out all ilie crumbs, rub the crust over with a 
little butter or lard, and set it in th 
a lew minutes to dry: till this with minced 
partridge (see that article), and put the loaf, 
bottom upwards, into a slew pan; add two 
spoonfuls of veal blond, with any oilier gar- 
nish you plea.se; let it remain on the fire till 
the bread is soft enough to allow a straw to 
it, liien take it out and dish it with 
the sauce round.

four partridges, pick and singe them; cut 
off their legs at the knee; season with pep- 
per, salt, chopped pander, tbvme, and muso*

at the bottom of the dish; put in tin- par- 
tridges with half a pint of good consomme. 
Line ilic edges of the dish with pull' paste, 
and rover with the same; do it over with 
egg, and let it bake tor an hour. 

PARTRIDGE TO ROAST. Take 
out the entrails, and singe the partridge over 
die s-tove, then roll a hit of butter in pepper 
anil salt, and put it into the inside of tin- 
bird; truss it neatly with the head turned on 
one side, keeping the breast as full as possi- 
ble; over which should lx? laid slices of fat 
bacon tied on with pack-thread; before it is 
put on the spit, break the back-bode, that it 
may lay the Ix-lter on the dish. A good 
si/.eii partridge will take half an hour; when 
nearly done, lake away the bacon, brown 
die partridge well ; sprinkle it with flour and 
salt, and froth it with butter; serve it with 
water-cresses, a good gravy under it, and 
bread sauce in a boat. 

PARTRIDGE: TO TRUSS. Let it be 

well picked and singed, then cut a slit in 
the back of the nek, and carefully take the 
crop out without breaking it; then cut off 
the vent, and draw out th-.- inside; after this, 
well wi|w the inside, and then put in a little 
pepper and salt, mixed with a bit of butter. 
Having cleansed it, proceed to truss the 
bird, by first cutting off the pinion at the first 
joint, so that the feathers netvl not be picked 
off that part ; break the back-bone, and truss 
it in the same manner as a fowl, bv pressing 
die legs close to the apron, then turn the bird 
on the breast, and run a skewer through the 
end of the pinion, the leg, the body, and the 
leg and pinion on the other side, with the 
head fixed on the end of the skewer, and 
over the breast lay a sliee of fat bacon, and 
tie it on with pack-thread. If for boiling or 
stewing, truss them the same as a fowl for 
boiling. 

PARTRIDGES TO -STEW. Truss 
the partridges as fowls are done for boiling; 
pound the livers with double the quantity of 
fat bacon and bread-crumbs boiled in milk; 
and some chopped parsley, thyme, shallots, 
and mushrooms; season with |x-p|XT, salt, 
grated leinou-|>cel, and mace. Stitlf the in- 
side of the bird*, tie them at lx>th ends, and 
put them into a stewpan lined with slices of 
bacon ; add a quart of good stock, half a pint 
of white wine, two onions, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and a few blades of mace; let them 
stew gently till tender; take them out, strain 
and thicken the sauce with tlour and butter, 
make it hot, and pour it over the partridges. 



PASTE. Be very particular that your 
slab or paste table, rolling-pin and cutters 
are clean, and free from all old paste, and be 
very careful that both the flour and butter 
are extremely ;n>od. Have a dry sieve al- 
ways in readiness, in or by the tlour tub, 
so as to use none without sifting it; for, 
though it may appear pure and fine, bran, or 
small particles of old paste may ha\e fallen 
into it ; sifting is, therefore, always neces- 
sarv. Weigh one |xmnd of flour, lay it in a 
circle on the slab: break one egg in the cen- 
tre, put a small quantity of salt, and a little 
bit of butter; mix all these together lightly, 
adil a little water, mix them again, then add 
more water, and so proceed until it binds 
into paste; but take rare that yon do not 
make it too still', nor si|ucc/e it much to- 
gether, till yon find there is sufficient water; 
then work it well together, and roll it out on 
the slab, but do not roll it too thin; work -a 
jxxind of butter on the slab, spread it out to 
i the paste, with a knife cut it off 
altogether, and lay it on the paste; then 
double the ends of the paste together, to in- 
close the butter; then give it one turn, dins: 
roll it out till von just perceive the butter 
through the paste; turn the end which is 
next to you half way over, and the oilier end 
over that, roll it once or twice with the roll- 
ing-pin; then let it rfand, this is called one 
turn; then, in three minutes time, turn it 
again, and so proceed until you have given 
it six turns; then roll it out, and cut it for 
patties or any shape you please ; but observe 
not to put over them too much egg, as that 
will prevent their rising; as soon as diey 
are baked, take them oil' the sheet, lay them 
on paper, and when cold, scra|x' the bottoms, 
nealK cut out the insides ready for what- 
ever you mean to put into them. For bak-

ter, and roll it out two or three times. This 
paste answers Aery well for common pies, but 
must Iw u'd when hot and fresh baked. 

PASTE FOR BOILED PUDDINGS. 
Pick and chop very fine half a |x>und of beef 
suet, add to it one pound and a quarter of

ami mix it up with tlie yolk of three eggs, 
beat together with a sjxxjn; and nearly a 
pint of spring-water; roll it out, and double 
it in folds three times, and it is rcadv. 

PASTE FOR RAISED PIES. Take 

four pounds of flour, one pound of butter, 
and a little silt, mix tlie.se together, adding 
water, a little at a time, taking care not to 
put too much, as this paste must Ijo made as 
stiff as |x*sible; when thoroughly mixed, 
give it two or three turn.", roll it and cut it 
out to die slui|>e you want for your pie. 
Sometimes the butter is melted in warm wa- 
ter, and so mixed with the flour; tin u 
will not require so much wah-r, and the 
paste will stand better; but as yo > work 
your )>usle, when yon lind it get too cold, 
warm it a little; the lii-st method of doing 
it is the best, if intended to be eaten. 

PASTE, RICE. (1) Mix together half 
a |xjimd of filled ground rice and a quarter 
of a pound of lic.-h butter, work it into a 
paste with cold water, diedge flour over the

PASTE, RICH SHORT. Weigh 
equal quantities of flour, of butter, and of 
pounded and sifted loaf-sugar ; rub the but- 
ter with the flour, then mix in the sugar, 
and rub it together till it will roll out; put 
it about half an inch thick over the tart, 
which may be of cherries, raspberries, or 
currants. 

PASTE, SHORT, FOR TARTS. 
Take one pound of flour, lay it on the slab, 
and in the centre put half a pound of butter,, 
two eggs, a very little salt, and a little wa- 
ter, mix tliem lightly together, and continue 
adding more water, till you find it bind ; mix 
it on the slab a little, and give it two turns, 
it is then ready for use. 

PASTE, SUET. Rub well with half a 
|x>und of fresh beef suet, chopped as finely as 
possible, three-quarters of a pound of flour, 
and half a tea-spoonful of salt ; make it into 
a stiff" paste with cold water, work it well, 
beat it with the rolling-pin, and roll it out 
two or three times. This paste answers for 
any kind of boiled fruit pudding. 

PASTE, SWEET. Rub into half a 
pound of flour three ounces of butter and tile 
same of pounded loaf-sugar, add one beaten 
egg, and as much warm water as will make 
it into a paste ; roll it thin for any kind of 
fruit tart, nib it over with tl>e beaten white 
of an egg, and sift sugar over h. 

PASTE FOR STRINGING TART- 
LETS. Mix with your hands a quarter 
of a pound of flour, an ounce of fresh butler, 
and a little cold water; nib it well between 
die board and your hand till it begins to 
string; cut it into small pieces, roll it out, 
and draw it into fine strings, lay them across 
your tartlets in any device you please, and 
bake them immediately. 

PATTIES FOR FRIED BREAD. Cut 

the crumb of a loaf of bread into square or 
round pieces nearly three inches high, and 
cut bits the same width for tops ; mark tlwin 
neatly with a knife ; fry tlie bread of a light 
brown color in clarified beef-dripping or fine 
lard. Scoop out the inside crumb, take 
care not to go too near to the bottom ; fill 
them wilh mince meat, prepared as for pat- 
ties, with stewed oysters, or with sausage 
meat ; put on the tops, and serve them upon 
a napkin. 

PATTIES, LOBSTER. See Lobsters. 

PEACHES, CHARLOTTE OF. Take 
twenty tolerably ripe peaches, cut tluan in 
halves, and scafd them in a light simp ; then 
drain and cut each half into three pieces 



(lengthwise) of equal thickness ; pot these 
into a pan with a quarter of a pound of pow- 
der-sugar, and half the quantity of warm 
butter; fry them lightly, and having prepar- 
ed your Charlotte in the usual way, pour in 
the peaches and finish it (see Charlotte). 
When in the dish for table, cover it com- 
pletely with the sirup, and serve immedi- 
ately. 

PEARS BAKED. (1) Take twelve large 

baking pears ; pare and cut them into halves, 
leaving the stem about half an inch long; 
take out the core with the point of a knife, 
and place them close together in a block-tin 
saucepan, the inside of which is quite bright, 
with the cover to lit quite close; put to them 
the rind of a lemon cut thin, with half its 
juice, a small stick of cinnamon, and twenty 
grains of allspice; cover them with spring- 
water, and allow one pound of loaf-suyar to 
a pint and a half of water: cover them up 
close, and bake them for six hours in a very 
slow oven : they will be quite tender, and of a 
bright color. Obs. Prepared cochineal is 
generally used for coloring the pears; but 
if the above is strictly attended to, it will be 
found to answer best. 

PEARS BAKED. (2) Take half a 
dozen fine pears, peel, cut them in halves, 
and take out the cores; put them into a pan 
with a little red wine, a few cloves, half a 
pound of sugar, and some water. Set them 
in a moderate oven till tender, then put them 
on a slow fire to stew gentlv ; add grated 
lemon-peel, and more sugar if in 
They will be sufficiently red. 

PEARS COMPOTE. Choose your 
fruit carefully, take oft" the tops, .and trim 
the tails, wash and drain them well ; then 
put them into a skillet with sugar, cinna- 
mon, two or three cloves, a little red wine, 
and some water. Set them on a slow fire, 
taking care to skin them. When sufficiently 
done, they will look wrinkled. Peel your 
fruit, and put it into a well glazed pipkin, 
with a glass of wine, a little cinnamon, 
sugar to the taste, and a little water ; put in 
also a pewter spoon; cover the pipkin close, 
and set it on hot ashes. When done, the 
pears will be of a fine red color. 

PEARS TO COMPOUND. Take a 
dozen large pears, coddle them ; when ten- 
der, take them out and l.w them in cold wa- 
ter, pare and cut them in halves; take out 
the cores, put them in sirup made thus: 
Two pounds and a half of sugar to fhree 
pints of water, a little lemon-peel pared very 
thin, boiled in them, and a little cochineal 
bruised and put into a muslin log: cover 
them, boil them quick till they are tender

and of a good color ; when cold, squeeze in 
the juice of two or three lemons. 

PEARS PRESERVED. Take care 
in making this preserve that the fruit be not 
too ripe ; tiny are in a fit state as soon as 
the pips are Llack. Set (lie pears on the 
fire in a sufficient quantity of water to cover 
them; take them off when quite soft, and 
throw them into cold w:iti:r; pare them 
lightly, rut oil the stalks, prick each with a 
pin sufficiently long to reach the cere, and 
put tliein again into cold water, with a 
handful of alum; sei them on the fire to boil 
until tlie pears are tender, then take them out, 
and |xit thyin into cold water for the third 
time. Clarifv and Ixiil some su^ar. [iiit .-.>me 
water to it, and when it boils, add (lie |x-ais, 
cover the |ian, and give the whole a boil; j 
fkim and |xmr it into an earthen pan and 
leave it. The next day, drain the sirup 
from tin- pears, add a little more clarified | 
sugar to it, and Ixiil it again; |x>ur it over 
the fruit, and leave it .is before; the next 
and two succf.-.-ive day.-, proceed in the same 
way, each time incieaMng the degree of ' 
boiling, then add tin- p<-ai.-, give the pre- 
serve a boil (covered), .-kirn and pour it into 
a pan, and place it in a stove for two days, 
then drain die fruit, and put it by for use. 

PEARS STEWED. (1) Wash and prick 

some large stewing |x-ars. and set them on 
the fire in a large stewing-pan of water to 
scald ; when scalded, take them out, and 
put them on the lire in a pan w illi a .-miicicnt 
quantity of thin clarified .-ngar to cover them, 
a -ink of cinnamon, a little mace, and two 
or three cloves; let them stew gently till 
they begin to soften and look rather red, 
then pin in a little of 1'ort wine, and let 
them continue .-ten ing until |-it.-|ly done, 
and lo<>k very rich and red; then put them 
in a basin or jar, with the liuuor over them; 
they will be all the better for keeping four or 
five days. 

PEARS STEWED. (2) Pare, cut into 

quarters, and take out the core of six good 
baking [tears; throw them aa they are done 
into water. To a pound of fruit allow a 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and three 
I ml them into a saucepan, cover 
them with cold water, keep the pan closely 
covered, and stew them gentry, till red and 
tender ; add, just before serving, a glass of 
Port wine. They may be eaten hot or cold, 
with cream, after dinner or at supper. 

IT. \<. i.KKFA. Young green peas, 

well dressed, are among the most delicious 

delicacie- i.f th. vegetable kingdom. They 

must be young; it is equallv indispensable 

12* 



that they be fresh gathered, and cooked as 
soon as they are stalled (or tley soon lose 
both their color and sweetness. After U-ing 
shelled, wash them, drain them in a cullen- 
der, put them on in plenty of boiling water, 
w itli a tea-spoonful of salt, and one of |xnmd- 
ed loaf sugar; boil them till they become 
tender, which, if young, will be in less AM 
halt' an hour; if old, they will require more 
than an hour; drain diem in a cullender, 
and put them immediately into a dish with 
a slice of fresh butter in it; some people 
think it an improvement to boil a small liuiich 
of mint with die. peas; it is then minced 
finely, and laid in small heaps at the end or 
>idcs of [he dish. If peas are allowed to 
stand in the water after being boiled they 
lose their color. 

PEAS FOR A SECOND COl'USE. 
Put a quart of tine green peas, 'ogether with 
a bit of butter the size of a walnut, into as 
much warm water as will cover them, in 
which let tliem stand for eight or ten min- 
utes. Strain off the water, put them into a 
saucepan, cover it, stir them frequently, and 
wlicn a little tender, add a bunch of parsley, 
and a young onion, nearly a dessert-spoonful 
of loaf-sugar, and an ounce of butter mixed 
with a tea-spoonful of flour; keep stirring 
tlii-iii now and then till the peas be tender, 
and add, if tliey become too thick, a table- 
spoonful of hot water. Before serving, take 
out the onion and parsley. 

PEAS PUDDING. Take a pint of 

good split peas, and having waslied, soak 
tliem well in warm water; then lie them in 
a cloth, put the (Kidding into a >auccpan of 
hot water, and l>oil it until quite soft. When 
done, beat it up with a little butter and salt; 
serve it with boiled pork or beef. 

PEAS POWDER. Pound together 
in a marble mortar half an ounce each of 
dried mint and sage, a drachm of celery- 
seed, and a quarter of a drachm of cayenne 
pepper ; rub them through a fine sieve. Thia 
gives a very savory relish to peas soup, and 
to water gruel, which, by its help, if the 
eater of it has not die most lively imagina- 
tion, lie may fancy he is sipping good peas 
soup. Obs. A drachm of allspice, or black 
pfp|M-i , may be (xmnded with die alxivc as 
an addition, or instead of the cayenne. 

PEPPER POT. Take as much spinach 
as will fill a good sized dish, put it in a 
saucepan without any water, set it on the 
fire, and let it boil ; then drain off all the li- 
quor, chop the spinach very fine, and return 
it to the saucepan, with die water ju>t drain- 
ed from it, more water, onions, three or four 



PER

potatoes, a lettuce or head of endive cut 
small, the bones of any cold roast meat, if 
you have them, and half a pound of bacon ; 
put the whole on the fire, and when it has 
boiled for about an hour, put in a few suet 
dumplings; leave it twenty or thirty min- 
utes longer ; season it well with cayenne, and 
serve. 

PEPPER POT IN A TUREEN. Stew 
gently in four quarts of water, till reduced to 
three, three pounds of beef, half a pound of 
lean ham, a bunch of dried thyme, two on- 
ions, two large potatoes pared and sliced; 
then strain it through a cullender, and add 
a large fowl, cut into joints and skinned, 
half a pound of pickled pork sliced, the 
meat of one lobster minced, and some small 
suet dumplings, the size of a walnut. When 
the fowl is well boiled, add half a peck of 

r'nach, that has been boiled and rubbed 
ough a cullender; season with salt and 
cayenne. It is very good without the lean 
ham and fowl. 

PERCH BOILED. Put them into cold 
water, and let them boil carefully ; serve with 
melted butter and soy. 

PERCH BROILED. Scrape, gut, and 
wash them ; dry them in a cloth, dust them 
with flour, and broil them. Sauce ; melted 
butter. Or they may be broiled without 
gutting them. They may also be stewed as 
carp are done. 

PERCH WITH WINE. Having scal- 
ed and taken out the gills, put the perch into 
a stewpan, with equal quantities of stock 
and white wine, a bay-leaf, a clove of gar- 
lic, a bunch of parsley and scallions, two 
cloves, and some salt. When done, take 
out the fish, strain off the liquor, the dregs 
of which mix with some butter and a little 
flour; teat these up, set them on the fire, 
stirring till quite done, adding pepper, grated 
nutmeg, and a ball of anchovy butter. Drain 
the perch well, and dish them with the above 
sauce. 

PERLINGO. Take a pound and a half 
of sifted flour, and having placed it on your 
slab, make a hole in the middle of it, into 
which put three-quarters of a pound of brown 
sugar, half a pound of fresh butter, the rind 
of two lemons grated, and ten eggs ; knead 
all these ingredients together well, until you 
have a pretty firm paste ; if it should l too 
thin, add a handful more flour. Then rut 
the paste into small pieces, each of which 
roll in the palms of your hands, till they are 
the length and thickness of your finger ; take 
a round stick (about half the diameter of your 



paste), press this down on each of the 
pieces, so that they may be their original 
thickness on one side, and thin on the other ; 
when all are thus pressed, form them into 
little crowns (the flat side inwards, and the 
thin end uppermost), lay them on white pa- 
per, and bake them in a moderate oven ; in 
the meanwhile, make some white sugar var- 
nish or icing, and when the perlingos are 
sufficiently done, dip them carefully in the 
varnish, one by one; then replace them hi 
the oven, a minute or two, to dry. 

PERRY. Perry is a pleasant and whole- 
some liquor, made from the juice of peal's, 
by means of fermentation, somewhat in the 
same manner as cider is made from apples. 

PETTITOES. Boil the feet, the liver, 
and the heart, of a sucking pig, in a little 
water, very gently, then split the feet, and 
cut the meat very small, and simmer it with 
a little of the water till the feet are perfectly 
tender; thicken with a bit of butter, a little 
flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little pepper 
and salt ; give it a boil up, pour it over a few 
sippets of bread, put the feet on die mince. 

PICKLE FOR 3IEAT. Six pounds 
of salt, one pound of sugar, and four ounces 
of saltpetre, boiled with four gallons of water, 
skimmed, and allowed to cool, forms a very 
strong pickle, which will preserve any meat 
completely immersed in it. To effect this, 
which is essential, either a heavy board or a 
flat stone must be laid upon the meat. The 
same pickle may be used repeatedly, provided 
it be boiled up occasionally with additional 
salt to restore its strength, diminished by the 
combination of part of the salt with the 
meat, and by the dilution of the pickle by 
the juices of the meat extracted. By bulling, 
the albumen, which would cause the pickle 
to spoil, is coagulated, and rises in the form 
of scum, which must be carefully removed. 

An H-bone, of ten or twelve pounds, 
weight will require about tlirce-quarters of a 
pound of salt, and an ounce of moist sugar, 
to be well rubbed into it. It will be ready 
in four or five days, if turned and rubbed 
every dav. 

The lime meat require? .-:illiiiL r depends 
upon the weight of it, and how much salt is 
used: and if it be rubbed in with a heavy 
hand, it will be ready much sooner than if 
only lightly rubbed. 

N. B. Dry the salt, and rub it with the 
sugar in a mortar. 

PORK requires a longer time to cure (in 

proportion to its weight) than beef. A leg 

of pork should be in salt eight or ten days; 

turn it and rub it every day. 

! Salt meat should be well washed before it

ra )x)iled, especially if it has been in salt ; 
long, that the liquor in which the meat is 
boiled, may not be too salt to make soup of. 
If it h;is IH-CII in salt a long time, and yon 
fear that it will lie too salt, wash it well in 
cold water, and *>ak it in luke-warm water 
for a couple of hours. If it is very tall, 
by it in water the night before you intend to 
dress it. 

PICKLE FOR TONGUES. To four 
gallon* of water, add two [xnmds and a 
naif of treacle, eight pounds of silt, two 
ounces of *all|x'tre; boil it, and skim it un- 
til cli-.ir, sprinkle salt over the tongue, and 
let it stand two davs, wipe it clean before 
Jim put it into tlie pickle, which must l>e quite 
cold; boil the pickle, every two or mm 
months, adding two or three handfuLs of salt, 
skimming it well. Half the (Hiantity is suf- 
ficient for two tongues. 

PICKLE FOR BEEF. Allow to four 
gallons of wati-r two pounds of brown sn^ar 
and six (xmnds of salt, boil it alxjnt twenty 
minutes, taking off the scum as it rises; the 
following dav |xuir it over the meat which 
has l;eeii | icked into tin 1 pick I ing-tub. Boil 
it every two months, adding three ounces of 
brown suirar and half a pound of common 
salt. P>\ this means it will keep good a 
y-;ir. The meat must be sprinkled with 
salt, and the next day wiped dry, before 
pouring the pickle over it, with which it 
should always U- coaipletely covered. With 
the addition of two ounces of saltpetre and 
one pound of salt, this pickle answer* t-'i

PIE, A.NGLO-FRANCAIS. Take a 



deep dish, line the edge with puff paste like 
a common pie ; stew a quarter of a pound 
of rice with some sugar until quite soft and 
sweet ; take a pound of ripe juicy cherries, 
which pick and roll in a quarter of .a pound 
of powder-sugar, and lay about a quarter of 
them at the Ixrttom of the dish ; cover these 
with a fourth part of the rice, tiien the cher- 
ries again, and so on till your materials are 
need, taking care to keep the pie high in the 
middle; cover it with a layer of puff paste, 
which wash over lightly with some white of 
egg, and strew a little powder-sugar over; 
put it in a moderate oven for an hour and a 
quarter; then take it out, mask the crust 
with apricot marmalade, and a few maca- 
roons crushed. Serve it either hot or cold. 

PIE, APPLE. (1) Take eight russe- 
tines, or lemon pippin apples; pare, core, 
ana cut not smaller than quarters; place 
them as close as possible together into a pie- 
di.-h, with four clove*; rub together in a 
mortar some lenion-|x-cl, wilh lour ounces 
of good moist sugar, and, if agreeable, add 
some quince jam ; cover it with puff paste; 
bake it an hour and a quarter. (Generally 
eaten warm).

s|xM,nl'ul of brown sugar, with a tea-spoon- 
ful of grated ginger and lemon-] >ecl, then 
a layer of apples, and so on alternately, 
till the dish is piled as full as it will hold. 
The next day wet the rim of tlie dish, line 
it with puff or tart paste, brush it with wa- 
ter, and rover it with paste; press the edge 
all round, notch it with a |>astc-cuticr, and

with liiur ounces of sugar in powder, and 
four ounces of butter lukewarm. Then lay 
on the upper crust, glaze with the white of 
egg, and strew sifted sugar all over. Let it 
bake in a moderate oven to a nice light col- 
or. Serve it hot. When you wish to serve 
it cold, you must leave out die butter. 

PIE, BEEF KIDNEY. Cut some kid- 
neys into thin slices, and place them in 
the bottom of your pie-dish, then sweet 
herbs chopped, such as parsley, thyme, shal- 
lots, mushrooms, pepper, and salt; con- 
tinue this till the dish is full, then cover the 
whole with slices of bacon, then finish your 
pie; bake it in the oven; when done, take 
out the bacon, and skim off the fat ; make a 
sauce with a glass of while wine, a tolerable 
quantity of cullis, and reduce it to the con- 
sistence of a good sauce, then squeeze an 
orange in it. Serve your pie hot. 

PIE, BEEF-STEAK. Cut the steaks off 
a rump, or any nice piece of beef, fat and 
lean together, about half an inch thick ; beat 
them a little with a rolling-pin, put over 
them some pepper, salt, and parboiled onion 
minced; roll them up, and pack them neatly 
into the dish, or lay the beef in slices; add 
some spoonfuls of gravy, and a tea-spoonful 
of vinegar. Cover tlie pie with a puff paste, 
and bake it for an hour. It is a common 
but mistaken opinion, that it is necessary 
to put stock or water into meat pies. Beef, 
mutton, veal, and pork, if not previously 
dressed, will be found to yield a sufficiency 
of gravy, and the pie will be better without 
any additional liquid. N. B. Large oys- 
ters, parboiled, bearded, and laid alternately 
with the steaks, their liquor reduced and 
substituted instead of the ketchup and wine, 
will be a variety. 

PIE, CHICKEN. Parboil, and then 
cut up neatly two young chickens ; dry them ; 
set them over a slow fire for a few minutes; 
have ready some veal stuffing or forcemeat, 
lay it at the 'bottom of the dish, and place in 
die chickens upon it, and with it some pie- 
ces of dressed ham ; cover it with |>aste. 
Bake it from an hour and a half to two 
hours ; when sent to table, add some good 
gravy, well seasoned, and not too thick. 
Duck pie is made in like manner, only sub- 
stituting die duck stuffing instead of the veal. 
N. B. The above may be put into a raised 
French crust and baked ; when done, take 
off the top, and put a ragout of sweetbread 
to tlie chicken. 

PIE, COD. Lay a fine piece of fresh 
cod in salt for several hours, dicn wash it 



well, season it with pepper, salt, nut meg and 
mace; place it in a dish, with a little but- 
ter and some good stock. Lay a crust over, 
and Ijake it; when done, pour in a <;mce, 
made as follows: a spoonful of stock, a 
quarter of a pint of cream, flour fcnd butter, 
grate in a little nutmeg and lemon-peel, and 
a few oysters, boil die whole once. 

PIE, COLD BEEF, VEAL, OR MUT- 
TON. Pound in a mortar some boiled po- 
tatoes; boil a cupful of milk, and while hot, 
mix it with die potatoes, and beat them till 
they become like a light paste ; roll it out, 
cut it with a flat dish, the size of a pie dish, 
so as it may be laid from off it upon the 
pie; cut die meat into slices, season it widi

hours \vidi a paper over it, to prevent the 



ciust from burning. When done, pour in 
some good gravy, with a little ready-mixed

lent repast for a journey, and will keep for 
several days. 

PIE, POTATO. Peel and slice your 
potatoes very thin into a pie-dish; between 
each layer of potatoes put a little chopped 
onion (three-quarters of an ounce of onion is

to bake it. N. 15. The yolks of tour eggs 
(boiled hard) may lie added; and when 
baked, a table-spoonful of good mushroom 
ketchup |)Oiired in throuuh a funnel. Obs. 
Cauliflowers divided into inouthfuls, and

PIG, Is in prime order for the spit when 
alxnit three weeks old. 

It loses |>art of it* goodness every hour af- 
ter it is killed ; if not quite fresh, no art can 
make the crackling crisp. 

To be in perfection, it should be killed in 
the morning to be eaten at dinner: it requires 
very careful toasting. A sucking-pig, like 
a young child, must not be left for an in- 
stant. 

The ends must have much more fire than 
the middle: for this pur|>osc is contrived an 
iron to hang before the middle pait, called a 
pig-iron. If you have not this, use a com- 
mon flat iron, or keep the fire fiercest at the 
two ends. 

For tlie stuffing, take of the crumb of a 
stale loaf about five ounces; rub it through a 
colander; mince fine a handful of sage (t. e. 
about two ounces), and a large onion (about 
an ounce and a half). Mix these together 
with an egg, some pepper and salt, and a bit 
of butter as big as an egg. Fill the belly of 
tlie pig with this, and sew it up: lay it to 
the tire, and Uiste it with salad oil till it is 



PIG 



144 



PIG 



quite done. Do not leave it a moment: it 
requires the mos* vigilant attendance. 

Roast it at a clear, brisk fire at some dis- 
tance. To gain the praise of epicurean pig- 
eaters, the crackling must be nicely crisped 
and delicately lightly browned, without be- 
ing either blistered or burnt. 

A small, three weeks old pig will be done 
enough in about an hour and a half. 

Before you take it from the fire, cut off the 
head, and part that and the body down the 
middle: chop the brains \fcry fine, with some 
boiled sage leaves, and mix them with good 
veal gravy, or beef gravy, or what runs from 
the pig when ^-ou cut its head off. Send up 
a tureenful of gravy besides. Currant sauce 
is still a favorite with some of the old school. 

Lay your pig Ijack to l>ack in the dish, 
with one half of the head on each side, and 
die ears one at each end, which you must 
take care to make nice and crisp; or you 
will get scolded, and deservedly, as the silly 
fellow was who Ixnight his wife a pig with 
only one ear. 

When you cut off the pettitoes, leave the 
skin long round the ends of the legs. When 
you first lay the pig before the fire, rub it all 
over with fresh butter or salad oil: ten 
minutes after, and the skin looks dry; 
dredge it well with flour all over, let it re- 
main on an hour, then rub it off with a soft 
cloth. 

N. B. A pig is a very troublesome subject 
to roast; most persons have them baked. 
Send a quarter of a pound of butter, and beg 
the baker to baste it well. 

PIG, BAKED. Lay your pig in a dish, 
flour it well all over, then rub it over with 
butter; butter the dish you lay it in, and put 
it into die oven. When done enough, take 
it out, and rub it over with a butter cloth ; 
dien put it again into the oven till it is dry, 
then take it out and lay it in a dish; cut it 
up, take a little veal gravv, and take off die 
fat in the dish it was baked in, and there 
will lie some good gravy at the bottom; put 
that to the veal gravy, with a little bit of but- 
ter, rolled in flour; lx>il it up, and put it in 
a dish in which the pig has been laid, and 
put the brains with some sage into the belly. 
Some persons like a pig to be brought to 
table whole, in which case you are only to 
put what sauce you like into the dish. 

PIG, BARBICUED. Scald, &c., a pig, 
of about nine or ten weeks old, the same as 
for roasting; make a stuffing widi a few 
eage-leaves, the liver of the pig, and two an- 
chovies boned, washed, and cut extremely 
small ; put them into a mortar, with some 
bread-Crumby a quarter of a pound of butter, 
a very little cayenne pepper, and half a pint 
of Madeira wine; beat diem to a paste, and 



sew it up in the pig ; lay it at a good distance 
before a large brisk fin;; sin^c it well; put 
two bottles of Madeira wine into die drip- 
ping-pan, and keep testing it all the time it 
is roasting; when half done, put two French 
rolls into die drippingpan ; and if there is not 
wine enough in the drippugpon, add more: 
when the pig is nearly done, take the rolls 
and sauce, and put them into a saucepan, 
with an anchovy cut small, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and die juice of a lemon ; take up die 
pig, send it to table with an apple in its 
mouth, and a roll on each side ; then strain 
the sauce over it. 

Some barbicue a pig of six or seven weeks 
old, and stick it all over with blanched al- 
monds, and baste it in the same manner widi 
Madeira wine. 

PIG, TO COLLAR. Cut off the feet, 
head, and tail; bone and wash it well, and 
dry it in a cloth. Season it highly with a 
quantity of pepper and sail ; roll it up firmly, 
and bind it with a piece of linen; sew it 
tightly. Put it on in boiling water, with the 
bones, let it boil for an hour, dien put it un- 
der a weight to press till it be cold, and take 
off the cloth. 

PIG'S CHEEK, TO COLLAR. Strew 

over a pig's face, and a neat's or pii's tongue, 
a little salt and saltpetre; let it stand eight 
or nine days, then Iwil them with two cow- 
heels, till all be sufficiently tender to admit 
of the bones being taken out ; lay upon a 
dish a piece of strong cloth, put the cheek 
upon it with die rind downwards ; season it 
highly with pepper, cloves, and a little salt; 
add the tongue and cow-heels, with more 
seasoning; roll and sew it up firmly, (Hit it 
into a jar and boil it for two hours, then 
press it widi a homy weight, and when cold 
take off the cloth. The cow-had may be 
omitted, and bodi cheeks used. 

PIG'S CHEEK, TO CURE. Strew 

salt over it, and let it lie two or three days, 
then pour over it die following mixture when 
it is cold; half a pound of ba\ salt, half an 
ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of a \tound of 
coarse brown sugar, one handful of common 
salt, and a penny-worth of cochineal, boiled 
in a pint of strong beer or porter; let it lie 
in die pickle a fortnight, turning it daily, 
dien hang it to smoke for a week. Wlien 
to be dressed, put it into lukewarm water to 
soak for a night, and in dressing it, follow 
the directions given for boiling hams. 

PIG'S FEET AND EARS PICKLED. 
Wash the feet and ears \ery clean, and be- 
tween every foot put a bay-leaf; when diey 
arc well soaked, add some cloves, mace, co- 
riander-seed, and ginger; put a botde of

them with melted butter and parsley, or a 
thickened brown gravy. 

PIGEON PIE. Chop some parsley and 
lemon thyme, with a few mushrooms; stew 
these in a little butler, into which put half a 
dozen young pigeons, with pepper and salt 
in their insides, and their legs turned in; 
stew them for a few minutes and turn them; 
when they begin to fry, put in sufficient con- 
somme to cover them, in which let them stew 
till they are well done; take them from the 
fire to cool ; in the meantime make a good 
puff paste, part of which roll out, and place 
round the edge of a dish; lay the pigeons in 
with the yolks of four eggs, boiled hard, and 
pour over them half of llie liquor lliev were 
stewed in; add a little pepper and salt, then 
lay on the top paste, trimming it neatly 
round, the same as you would any other pie ; 
on the top form a star of leaves, with a hole 
in the centre ; eg, r it lightly over, and put it 
to bake in a moderate oven, taking care that 
it has not too much color ; when done, add 
to the liquor that remained from the pigeons, 
a little butter sauce, make it very hot, and 
[xwr it on the pie. Serve it hot, either for 
a remove or side dish. 

PIGEONS WITH RICE AND PAR- 

M F.SAN CHEESE. Pick and wash clean 
half a dozen nice pigeons, cut them into quar- 
ters; brown some butter with flour, add to 
it a pint of good stock, with three grated 
onions, some pepper and salt, stew the pig- 
eons in this till tender, take them out and 
mix in the juice of one lemon, Ixiii and strain 
the sauce over the pigeons. Boil about three- 
quarters of a pound of whole rice in a pint 
and a half of stock, with half a pound of fresh 
butler, some graled nutmeg anil salt; when 
it is lender, add two liandfuls of grated 1'ar- 
incsan cheese. Put more than Irilf of the 
vice equally round the dish in \\ hich the pig- 
eons are placed, and cover them with what 
remains, brush it over with a well-beaten 
egg, and then strew it thickly with more 
I'anuesan ; <o\er a flat baking-tin with salt, 
place the dish upon this, and bake it for nearly 
three-quarters of an hour in a slow oven ; ii 
should be of a fine gold color. 

PIGEONS, TO ROAST. Pick, clean, 



singe, and wash them well ; truss them with 
three feet on, and put into them some pepper 
and salt. While roasting, baste them with 
butter. A litlle before serving, dust them 
with flour, and froth them with butter. 
Roast them for half an hour. Serve them 
with parsley and butter in the dish, or make 
a gravy of die giblets, some minced parsley, 
seasoned with |>ep|>cr and salt. Thicken 
with a little flou;- and butter; pour it with 
the giblets into the dish, and then put in the 
pigeons. 

PIGEONS, STEW. (1) Clean them nice- 
ly, truss them as for lulling, put into their in- 
side some pepper and salt ; brown in a sauce- 
pan three ounces of butter with u table-spoon- 
ful of (lour, add as much gravy or water as will 
nearly cover the pigeons, put them in with 
the livers, gizzards, and pinions, salt, and 
some minced par.-lev, spinach may also be 
added; let them stew for three-quarter* of 
an hour; add, a few minutes before serving, 
the yolks of Jour or six hard-boiled eggs. 

PIGEONS, STEW. (2) Wash and clean 
six pigeons, cut them into quarters, and put 
all their giblets with tliem into a stewpan, a 
piece of butter, a litlle water, a bit of lemon- 
|K j el, two blades of mace, some chopped pars- 
ley, salt, and pepper; cover tlie pan closely, 
and stew them till they lie tender; thicken 
the sauce with the yolk of an egg beaten up 
with three table-spoonfuls of cream and a bit 
of butter dusted with (lour; let them slew 
ten minutes lunger before serving. 

PIKE, BAKED. Scrape the scales off 
a large pike, take out the gills, and clean it, 
without breaking die skin; stuff llie tish 
with a forcemeat made of two liandfuls of 
grated bread, one of finely-minced suet, some 
chop|>ed parslev, and a little fresh Initter, 
sc-asoued uitli j.epper, sail, mace, grated 
lemon-peel and a nutmeg, pounded all togeth- 
er m a mortar, with two whole r jgg. Fasten 
llie tail of tlie |>ikc into its month with a 
skewer, then dip it, first into a well-beaten 
egg, and then into grated Ixvad, which repeat 
twice; baste it over with butter, and bake 
it in an o\eu. 

If two <>f them are to l>e served, make one 
of them of a green color, by mixing a quan- 
tity of finely-minced parsley with the grated 
bread. When the fish is of a fine brown 
color, cover it with paper until it is done. 
Serve with a Dutch sauce in a sauce-tureeu. 

PIKE, BOILED. Wash clean, and 
takeout the gills; stuff them with the follow-

PORK. DAIRY-FED pork is the !x-<: ; 
the flesh should look white and smooth, and 
the fat IK- while and line. In preparing a 
hog for bacon, the rilis are cut, with a very 
little flesh on them, from die side, which 
has the fore and hind leg attached to it; 
the bind leg is tlx-n called a gammon of ba- 
con, but il is generally reserved for a ham. 
On each side there is a la rife spare rib, 
which is usually divided into two, one call- 
ed the sweet bone, the oilier the blade Ume. 
There are also grukins, chine, or back 
bone. 

Hog's lard is the inner fat of the bacon 
hog. 

Porkers are not s-) old a? hogs; they 
make excellent pickled pork, but are cho- 
sen more particularly lor roasting. 

To roa-it a le^r, a saiall onion is minced 
together with three sage leaves, - 
with |X'p|K!r and salt, and put under the 
skin at the knuckle Ixmc; the skin is cut 
into stri| nearly half an inch apart, and 
rubbed over with a bit of butter. If weigh- 
ing seven or eight pounds, it will require 
nearly three hours to roast. 

A spare rib should be roasted, is basted 
with butter, and baa sage leaves dried, nib- 
bed to a powder, and mixed with salt and 
pepper, sprinkled over it. 

Both a loin and neck are jointed, the 
skin scored in narrow strips, and inhbed 
with butter. If wei^him; HX - 
fxmnds, it will require rather more than two 
hours to ron.->t. 

A griskin may be either broiled 
ed. 

A chine is smiled here and there ni;h 
bread crumbs, mixed UH|I a liltlc butter, 
and Masoned with some linely shred ML'C, 
jKir.-ley, and lh\me, >..me j-epper and salt. 
The skin is cut into strips and nibbed with 
butter; it is then roasted, and served with 
apple sauce, as are also the preceding 
roaaU. 

A porker's head H ctitfled like a sticking 
pig, sewed (irmly, and huntf on a string to 

Tte shoulder may be roasted, but, being 

very lal, it is generally preferred pickled. 

The breast may 1; made into a pi", or 
broiled. 

To l>oil hams, they should be put on in 
water, the chill taken off, and simmered for 
four or live hours, taking care not to allow 
them lo boil. 

The prime season for pork is from No- 
vemU r to .March. 

Take particular care it be done enough: 



P OR 



148 



FOR 



other meats under-done are unpleasant, but 
pork is absolutely uneatable; the sight of it 
is enough to appal the sharpest appetite, if 
its gravy has the least tint of redness. 

Be careful of the crackling; if this be 
not crisp, or if it l>e burned, you will Ite 
scolded. Pickled Pork, takes Ynore time 
than any other meat. If you buy your pork 
ready salted, ask how many days it lias 
been in salt; if m:Mi\, it will require to be 
soaked in water for six hours before you 
dress it. When you cook it, wash ami 
scrape it as clean as possible; when deli- 
cately dressed, it is a favorite dish with al- 
most everylx>dy. Take care it does not 
boil fast ; "if it does, the knuckle will break 
to pieces, before the thick part of the meat 
is warm through; a \t~ of seven pounds 
lakes three hours and a half Aery slow sim- 
mering. Skim your pot very carefully, and 
when you take the meat out of the boiler, 
scrape it clean. 

\ leg of nice jxirk, nicely salted, and 
nicely boiled, is as fine a cold relish as cold 
ham; esjiecially if, instead of cutting into 
the middle when hot, and so letting out 
it* juices, you cut it at the knuckle: slices 
broiled are a good luncheon, or supper. 

Mem. Some |x?rsoMs who sell pork ready 
sailed have a sillv trick of cutting the knuc- 
kle in two; we sup|xise that this is done to 
s.i.'e their salt; brt it lets all the gravy out 
of the leg; and unless you boil your pork 
iMorely for the sake of the pot-liquor, which 
in this case receives all the goodness and 
strength of the meat, friendly reader, your 
oracle cautions you to buy no leg of pork 
v.-hich is slit at the knuckle. 

1 1" pork is not done enough, nothing is more 
disagreeable; if too much, it not only loses 
'us color and flavor, but its substance be- 
comes soft like a jelly. 

It must never apjx-arat table without pars- 
nips; they are an excellent vegetable, and 
deserve to be much more popular; or carrots, 
turnips, and greens, or mashed potatoes, &c. 

Obs. Remember not to forget the mus- 
t,ird-|x>t. 

PORK, LEG, Of eight pounds, will re- 
quire about three hours : score tlie sk ins across 
in narrow stri|>cs (some score it in dia- 
monds), about a quarter of an inch apart; 
stuff the knuckle with sage and onion, minced 
fine, and a little grated bread, seasoned with 
pepper, salt, and the yolk of an egg. 

Do not put it too near the fire : rub a little 
sweet oil on the skin with a paste-brush, or 
a goose-feather: this makes the crackling 
crisper and browner than basting it with 
dripping; and it will be a better color than 
all the art of cookery can make it in any 
other way ; mid this is die best way of pre- i 



venting the skin from blistering, which is 
principally occasioned by its being put too 
near the fire. 

PORK Spare Rib, Usually weighs about 
eight or nine pounds, and will take from two 
to three hours to roast it thoroughly ; not ex- 
actly according to its weight, but the thick- 
ness of the meat upon it which varies very 
much. Lay the thick end nearest to the 
fire. 

A. proper bald spare rib of eight pounds 
weight (so called because almost all the meat 
is pared off), with a steady fire, will be done 
in an hour and a quarter. There is so little 
meat on a bald spare rib, that if yon have a 
large, fierce fire, it will be burned Itelorc it 
is warm through. Joint it nicely, and crack 
the ribs across as you do ribs of lamb. 

When you put it down to roast, dust on 
some flour, and baste it with a little butter ; 
dry a dozen sage leaves, and rub them thr< >u;;li 
a hair-sieve, and put them into the t<>|> of a 
dredging-box ; and about a quarter of an hour 
before die meat is done, baste it with butter ; 
dust with the pulverized sage. 

Obs. Make it a general rule never to 
pour gravy over any thing that is roasted; 
1;>y so doing, the dredging, &c. is wasljcd off, 
and it eats insipid. 

Some jx-ople cane a spare rib by cutting 
out in slices the thick part at the bottom of 
the bones. When this meat is cut away, 
tlie bones may be easily separated, and are 
esteemed verv sweet picking. 

Apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and good 
mustard are indispensable. 

PORK CHEESE. Choose tlie head of 
a small pig which may weiijli about twelv 
pounds the quarter. Sprinkle over it and 
the tongues of four pigs, a little common salt 
and a very little saltpetre. Let them lie 
linn- days, wash them, and tie them in a clean 
cloth; boil them until the bones will come 
easily out of the head, take off the .-kin as 
\\liole as possible, place a bowl in hot water 
and put in the licad, cutting it into small 
pieces. In the bottom of a round tin, shaped 
like a small cheese, lay two strips of cloth 
across each other, they must be loiiif eiiouuli 
to fold over the top when tlie shape is full, 
place the skin round the tin, and nearly half 
fill it with the meat, which has Ixt-n highly 
seasoned with pepper, cayenne and salt ; put 
in some tongue cut into slices, then the rest of 
the meat and the remainder of the tongue, 
draw the cloth tightly across the top; put on 
it a board or a plate that will lit into the sha|x>, 
and place on it a heavy weight, which must 
not be taken off till it be quite cold. It is 
eaten with vinegar and mustard, and served 
for luncheon or supper.

POT 



POTATOES. The vegetable kingdom 
affords no food more wholesome, more easily 
procured, easily prepared, or less ex|xMisive, 
than the potato : yet. although this most useful 
vegetable is dressed almost every day, in 
almost . \crv family, for one plate of |>otat<x-s 
that c< Hues' to table as it should come, ten are 
spoiled. 

Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, 

unles.- they are very large. Fill a saucepan 

half full of potatoes of equal size (or make 

them so bv dividin? the laix'er ones), put to 

them as much colil water as will cover them 

abonl an inch: they are sooner lioiled, ami 

cy, than when drowned in water. 

I spoiled bv hav MIL; too

too iiincli : they inn-it merely bft Covered, and 
a Mill'- alloweil t : -r waste in Ixiilinu, so thai 
they may be jn<t c,,\ered at the finish. 

Set them on a mrlenite lire till they Ixiil ; 
then take them off, and |Mit them by the side 
of the lire to simmer sl.iwly till they are soft 
enough to admit a fork (place no de|>endence 
Oil tin- usual test of their skins' clacking, 
which, if they are liled fast, will happen to 
some (totatoes when they are if it half done, and 
the insides quite hard). Then jxmr tlt<' wa- 
ter off (if you let the potatoes remain in the 
water a moment after they are done eimiiuli, 
they will become waxy ami watery), uncover 
the saucepan, and set it at such a distance 
from the fire as will secure it from taming; 
tlioir su|x'rt]uous moisture will evaporate, and 
the potatoes will be perfectly dry and mealy. 

You may afterward place a napkin, folded 
op to the size of the saucepan's diameter, 
over the imtators, to keep them hot and 
mealy till wanted. 

This method of managing potatoes is in 
every respect equal to steaming them ; and 
dressed in half the time. 

There is such an inlinite variety of sorts 
and -i/es ofpOtlkMj thai it is ini[is.-il>le to 
nay how Ions; tliey will take duini;: the best 
way i- t try them with a link. Moderate- 
Fixed (xttaUtes will generally ' done enough 
in liftecn or twenty minutes. 

POTATOES, NEW. The best way to 
clean new potatoes is to nib them with a 
i'lth or tlaimel, or scruhhin<;-hru.li. 

.\> w |x>tatocs are poor, watery, and insip- 
id, till they are full two inches in diameter: 
they are not worth tlx* trouble of boiling be- 
fore midsummer day. 

Ob*. Some cooks prepare sauces to pour 

over |>tatocs, made with l)ittter, sail, and 
ppp|n-r, or uravy, or melted tatter and ketch- 
Op; or stew the potatoes in ale, or water 
Reasoned with pepper and -all ; i liake them 
with hen inu- <>i sprat*, mixed with layers 
Of potatoes, sea-oned with pcp|>ei , salt, sweet 
n cut mutton or

beef into slices, and lay them in a stewpan, 
and on them potatoes and spices, then anoth- 
er layer of the meat alternately, pouring in 
a little water, covering it up very close, and 
boiling it slowly. 

POTATO BALLS. Mix mashed pota- 
toes with the yolk of an egg ; roll them into 
balls; dour them, or egg and bread-crumb 
them ; and fry them in clean drippings, or 
brown them in a Dutch oven. 

POTATO BALLS RAGOUT, Are 
made by adding to a pound of potatoes a 
i|itarter of a |x>und of grated ham, or some 
sweet herbs, or chopped pareley, an onion or 
eschalot, sail, pep|x-r, and a little grated 
nutmeg, or other spice, with the yolk of a 
couple of cijus : they are then to be dressed 
as Potato Halls. 

Obs. An agreeable vegetable relish, and 
a good .upper-dish. 

POTATOES BOILED, TO BROIL. 

After tailing potatoes not quite sufficiently to 
send to table, put them on a gridiron over a 
clear lire, and turn them frequently till they are 
of a nice brown color all over; serve them 
hot ; take care they do not become too hard, 
as that spoils the flavor. 

POTATOES, CASSEROLE. Boil and 
peel some good mealy potatoes, pound them, 
and mix with them some butler, cream, and 
a little salt, put them atant an inch and a 
half high upon a flat dish, and leave an open- 
ing in the centre ; bake them of a light brown 
color, and take out as much from the ceiitrt; 
as will admit of a ragout, fricassee, or mac- 
aroni, being put into it. 

POTATOES, COLCANNON. Boil 
potatoes and greens, or spinage, separately ; 
mash the potatoes ; squeeze the greens dry ; 
chop them quite line atxl mix them wilh the 
potatoes, with a little butter, pepper, and 
salt; put it into a mould, buttering it well 
first ; let it stand in a hot oven for ten min- 
utes. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. When 

boiled and peeled, allow four large mealy 
potato's, half tlieir weight of butter and of 
(XHinded loaf sugai', two eggs beaten, half 
the grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt; 
pound tlie potatoes in a mortar with die 
other ingredients; beat the yolks of four 
eggs ; roll up the croquettes ; dip them into 
the U-aieii eggs, and roll them in sifted bread 
cmnib-i; in an hour, roll them again as be- 
iry them in Uilter; put tU'in upon

eggs or pears, roll them into a well-beaten 
egg, and then into grated bread crammed, 
with pepper and salt ; fry them in plenty of 
lard or dripping till they are of a fine brown 
color, lay them before the fire to drain ; 
serve them with a fringe of fried parsley. 

POTATOES FRIED* IN SLICES 
OR RIBBONS. Peel large potatoes; slice 
them about a quarter of an inch thick, or 
cut them in shavings round and round, as 
you would peel a lemon ; dry them well in a 
clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping. 
Take care that your fat and frying-pan are 
quite clean; put it on a quick fire, watch it, 
and as soon as the lard boils, and is still, 
put in the slices of potato, and keep moving 
them till they are crisp. Take them up, 
and lay them to drain on a sieve : send them 
up with a very little salt sprinkled over them. 

POTATOES FRIED WHOLE. When 
nearly boiled enough, put them into a stew- 
pan with a bit of butter, or some nice clean 
beef-drippings; shake them about often (for 
fear of burning them), till they are brown 
and crisp; drain them from the fat. Obs. 
It will be an elegant improvement previous 
to frying or broiling the potatoes, to flour 
them and dip them in the yolk of an eg*;, 
and then roll them in fine-sifted bread- 
crumbs; they will then deserve to be called 

POTATOES FOLL DRESSED. 

POTATOES RAW OR COLD, TO 
FRY. Wash, peel, and put them into cold 
water for one or two hours, cut them into 
slices about half an inch thick, and fry them 
a light brown in boiling clarified beef suet. 
Cold boiled potatoes, cut in slices, may be 
done in the same manner. 

POTATO FRITTERS. Peel, and 
pound in a mortar, six mealy potatoes, with 
a little salt, a glass of white wine, some 
pounded sugar, cinnamon, and an ounce of 
butter ; roll it out with a little flour, cut 
them the size of a wine glass, and fry tliem 
in Ixiiling clarified dripping. Serve them 
with sifted loaf sugar over them. 

POTATOES, MASHED. (1) When, 
your potatoes are thoroughly boiled, drain 
them quite dry, pick out every s|x-ck, &c. and 
while hot, rub them through a colander into 
a clean stewpan. To a |xmnd of potatoes 
put alxuit half an ounce of butter, and a t.i- 
ble-spoontiil of milk : do not spake them too 
moist; mix them w<ll together. Obs. 



When the potatoes are getting old and 
specky, and in frosty weather, this is the 
!> t way of dressing them. You may put 
them into shapes or small tea-cups; egg 
them with yolk of egg, and brown them very 
slightly before a slow fire. 

POTATOES, MASHED. (2) Boil the 
potatoes, peel and mash them very smoothly ; 
put for a large dish four ounces of butter, 
two eggs beat up in half a pint of good milk, 
and some salt ; mix them well together, 
heap it upon a dish with a table-spoon to 
give it a rough and rocky appearance, or 
put it on a dish and score it with a knife, 
dip a brush or feather into melted butter, 
and brush over the lop lightly ; put it into 
a Dutch oven, and let it brown gradually 
for an hour or more. To mash potatoes in 
a plain way, mix with them two ounces of 
butter, half a pint of milk, and a little salt. 
When mashed potatoes are not browned, it 
is a great improvement to add pepper, salt, 
and one onion minced as finely as possible; 
heat the potatoes in a saucepan, and serve 
them hot. 

POTATOES, ROASTED. Wash and 
dry your potatoes, (all of a size), and put 
them in a tin Dutch oven, or cheese-toaster: 
take care not to put tliem too near the fire, 
or they will get burned on the outside before 
they are warmed through. Large potatoes 
will require two hours to roast them. 
N. B. To save time and trouble, some 
cooks half boil them first. This is one of 
the l>est opportunities the BAKER has to 
rival the cook. 

POTATOES ROASTED UNDER 
MEAT. Half Ixiil larsfe potatoes, drain the. 
water from them, and put them into an earth- 
en dish, or small tin (KIM, under meat that is 
roasting, and baste them with some of the 
dripping: when they are browned on one 
side, turn them and brown th:- other; si-mi 
tliem up round the meat, or in a small dish. 

POTATOES SCALLOPED. Mash ,*,. 
tatoes as directed, then butter some nice 
clean scollop-shells, patty-|Kins, or te,i-cii|,s 
or saucers; put in your |x>tatocs; make 
tlwm smooth at the top; cross a knife over 
i them; strew a lew tine bread-crumbs on 
them: sprinkle them with a paste-brush 
with a few drops of melted butter, and then 
set them in a Dutch o\en; when they are 
browned on tlie top, take them carefully out 
of the shells, and brown the other side. 

POTATO SNOW. The potatoes must 

I):' lire from sjwiN. and tile whitest you can 
pick out ; put them on in cold water; when 
they Ix'gin to crack, strain the water from

of the fire till they are quite dry, 
and fall to pieces ; rub them through a wire 
sieve on the dish they are to lie sent up in, 
and do not disturb them afterward. 

POT POURRI. Gather, when perfect- 
ly dry, a peck of roses; pick off the leaves, 
and strew over them three-qtiarters of a 
pound of << numon salt; let them remain 
two or three days, and if any fresh flowers 
are added, some more salt should be sprin- 
tliem. Mix with the roses half a 
pound of tinely-pounded bay silt, the same 
quantity of allspice, of cloves, and of brown 
i|iiarter of a pound of zuin-henju- 
miu, and two ounces of orris-root ; add a 
glare of brandy, and any sort of fragrant 
flown. Mich as orange and lemon (lowers 
rosemary, and a threat quantity of lavender 
flowers also white lilies: a green orange 
stuck with cloves may be added. All the 
flowers must be gathered perfectly dry. 

l'i I I I Mi BEEF, VEAL, GAME, or 
POULTRY. Take three pound* of lean 
gravy beef, nil) it well with an ounce of 
salt|-tre. and tncn a hanilful of common 
salt ; let it lie in salt for a couple of days, 
rubbing it well each day; then put it into

considered the perquisite of the cat) and ia 
completely drained of all its succulence, beat 
in a mortar with salt and a little ground 
black [x'pper and allspice, as directed in 
the fore-joing receipt, and it will make as 
good potted beef as meat that hag been 
baked till its moisture is entirely extracted, 
which it must be, or it will not keep two 
days.

POULTRY. In choosing a turkey, the 
youn<r cock bird is to be preferred ; tlie best 
have black legs, and if young, the toes and 
bill are pliable and feel soft. A hen turkey 
is chi-sen by the same rules. 

l-'owls with black legs are the l>est; if 
fresh, the vent is close and dark ; if young, 
the coml)s are bright in the color, and die 
legs smooth tlie spurs of a young cock are 
short. 

A goose, if young and fine, is plump in 
the breast, the fat white and soft, the feet 
yellow, and but few hairs upon them. 

Ducks may be chosen by the same rules, 
and are hard and thick on the breast and 
belly. 

- should be quite fresh, the breast 
plump and fat, the feet elastic, and neither 
flabby nor discolored at tlie vent. 

To prepare a turkey for dressing, every 
|)|HL' is carefully picked out; and in drawing 
tnrkevs and fowls, care must be taken not 
to break llie gall bair, nor the -,'iit which 
joins tlie gizzard, as it is impossible to re- 
move the bitterness of tin- one, or the gritti- 
ii' of the other. Tlie hairs are si 
with white paper; tlie leg-bone is broken 
close to tlie foot, an<i the sinews drawn on: 
a cloth is then p-.it over the bi> 
tin- Ix.ne flattened with a rolling-pin, the 
liver and gizzard, made delicately < 
f.i-!cned into each pinion. A stnin 
.i'ii sausage meat, adding some grated 
bread, and mixing it with the l>ea;ea yolks 
_'*, or a shilling as for a fillet of 
\i-al. i- tlicn put into the btvast, and the 
turkey, well nibbed over with lloiir, is put 
down to roast. It is basted constantly with 
lMter, and when the steam draws towards 
tile lire, it is nearly done; it is tlicn dredg- 
ed with Hour, and basted -.lith more Uitter, 
served with j;ra\y in the dish, and mi niched 
with sausages, or with f-rcenieat balls if 
veal -tiiMini.' is used, and bread .-auce in a 
sauce tiirtvn. 

To boil a turkey. After being nicely

PRESERVES 



cleaned, it is trussed with the legs drawn in 
under the skin, stuffed with a forcemeat, as 
(or veal, adding a few chopped oysters; 
then boiled in a well-floured cloth, and serv- 
ed with oyster, white or celery sauce, poured 
over it, and alto some in a sauce tureen. 
Boiled ham, tongue, or pickled pork, is eat- 
en with it. A large-sized turkey will require 
more than two hours to boil. Turkey, with 
celery sauce, is stuffed and trussed neatly, 
laid all over with slices of bacon, tied in a 
cloth, and boiled in water, with a little salt, 
butter, and lemon-juice added. It is served 
thickly covered with celery sauce. 

Turkey poults are stuffed and roasted in 
the same manner as a full-grown turkey. 
They will require rather more than an hour 
to roast. They are dressed with the heads 
t\\ -istcd under the wing, as are also turkeys 
sometimes, but it seems an injudicious cus- 
tom, as the side on which the head is cannot 
Ix? nicely browned, and in carving, the blood 
from the neck is apt to mingle with the 
gravy. 

To roost a fowl. It is picked, nicely 
cleaned, and singed; the neck is cut off 
close by the hick ; the fowl is then washed, 
and if a large one, stuffed with forcemeat. 
It is trussed and dredged with flour; and 
when put down to roast, basted well with 
butter, and frothed up. When the steam is 
observed to draw towards the fire, it is 
sufficiently done ; served with gravy in the 
dish, and bread sauce in a butter tureen. 
A good-sized fowl will require above an hour 
to roast. 

Chickens are roasted as the above, and 
served with gravy in the dish, which is 
garnished with fried eggs, and bread sauce 
in a sauce tureen ; they will require from 
half an hour to three-quarters to roast. 

To boil a fowl. When nicely singed, 
washed, and trussed, it is well dredged with 
flour, and put nit in boiling water, and if a 
large one, boiled nearly an hour. It is 
served with parsley and butter, white, or 
Jiver sauce. 

Two boiled fowls, served with a tongue 
between them, make a handsome top dish. 

Boiled chickens are improved by being 
stuffed, and will require nearly half an hour 
to boil. 

To roast a goose. After being well 
cleaned, picked, and singed, it is washed, 
made jjcrfectly dry, and stuffed with about 
four table-spoonfuls of grated bread, an on- 
ion finely minced, together with three sage- 
loaves, seasoned with salt and |X'p|>er, and 
mixed with a well-beaten egg; or, the j 
stuffing is made of boiled mashed potatoes, 
seasoned in the same way as the other-, and 
mixed with a Ix-aten rj<j. If roasted on a 
spit, each end is tied on tightly; it is basted 
at first with a little bit of butter, after which 



the fat that drops from it is used. It is 
served with tjravy in the dish, and apple 
sauce in a sauce tureen. A large goose will 
require an hour and a half to roast. At ta- 
ble, an opening is cut in the apron, and a 
glass of Port wine, with which is mixed a 
large tea-spoonful of made mustard, is pour- 
ed into the body of the goose. This is also 
an improvement to ducks. 

A green goose, atjout two or three months 
old, is seasoned with pepper and salt only, 
and requires to be basted with butter. It 
requires about an hour to roast. 

To roast ducks. They are nicely 'picked, 
cleaned, singed, and washed, seasoned with 
pepper and salt; or stufled, and served with 
gravy, as directed in pp. 66, 67. A duck 
may be boiled for nearly an hour, and served 
with onion sauce poured over it. 

PRESERVES, SWEETMEATS. &c. 

All sweetmeats should be preserved in a 
brass pan, which must 1x3 well scoured with 
sand and vinegar, washed with hot water, 
and wiped perfectly dry before it is used. 

An iron plate or stove is preferable to a 
fire for preserving on; and by Ixiiling the 
fruit quickly, the form, color, and flavor, 
will be belter preserved, and there will be 
less waste than* in slow boiling. A round 
wooiien stick, smaller at one end than at 
the other, in Scotland called a thevil, is 
lietter adapted for stirring sugar or preserves 
with than a silver spoon, which last is only 
used for skimming. That there may lie no 
waste in taking off the scum, it is put through 
a line silk sieve, or through a hair sieve, 
with a l)it of muslin laid into it; the clear 
part will run into the vessel placed lx j low, 
and may be returned to the preserving- 
pan. 

A silver soup ladle is used for putting pre- 
serves into the jars, which should l)e of 
brown stone, or of white wedtjewood ware. 
After the jellies or preserves are put in, they 
must not be moved till quite cold, when they 
are covered with a piece of white paper, cut 
so as to fit into the jar, and dipped into brandy 
or rum. They are then stored in a cool dry 
place, and should be looked at occaMon.dlv. 
If in a few weeks they be observed to fer- 
ment, the sirup should be first strained from 
the fruit, then boiled till it is thick, and 
again poured over the fruit, previously put 
into clean jars. 

Sugar, low in price, and consequently 
coarse in quality, is far from lx?ing rlieapest 
in the end ; while that which is most refin- 
ed is always the best. White sugars should 
Ix; chosen as shining and as close in texture 
as possible. 

The best sort of brown sugar has a bright 
and gravelly appearance. 

A jellv-bag is made of half a square of

BLACK CURRANTS. Gather 

the currants upon a dry day; to every 
pound allow half a pint of red currant 
juice, and a pound and a half of finely- 
pounded loaf sugar. With scissors clip off 
the heads and stalks ; put the juice, sugar, 
and currants into a preserving pan; shake 
it frequently till it boils; carefully remove 
the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take 
off the scum as it ri^es ; let it boil for ten or 
fifteen minutes. This preserve may be eat- 
en with cream, and made into tarts. 



CHERRIES. To a pound of 

cherries allow three-quarters of a pound 
of pounded loaf sugar; carefully stone them, 
and as they are done, strew part of the su- 
gar over them; boil them fast, with the re- 
mainder of the sugar, till the fruit is clear 
and the sirup thick ; take off the scum as it 
rises. Or they may be boiled ten minutes 
in an equal quantity of sugar, which has 
been previously clarified and boiled candy 
high. Part of the kernels may be added. 

CUCUMBERS. Take large 

and fresh-gathered cucumbers; 'split them 
down and take out all the seeds ; lay them 
in salt and water that will bear an egg, 
three days; set them on a fire with cold 
water, and a small lump of alum, and boil 
them a few minutes, or till tender; drain 
them, and pour on them a thin sirup; let

are carefully ( .-leaned, by putting them into 
a cullender, and pouring warm water over 
them; if very dirty, this is to be repeated 
two or three times, and after being dried in 
a dish IK -to re the fire, tliey are nibbed in a 
clean coarse cloth, all tin- stalks and stones 
picked (ut, and then a little flour dredged 
over them. The raisins are stoned with a 
small sharp-jxiinted knife ; it is cleansed in 
a basin of water, which also receives the 
seed. Tlie pudding cloth must be kept es- 
pecially clean, or it will impart an unpleas- 
io anything that is boiled in it; 
and when taken off" a pudding, it ouiiht im- 
mediately to 1x3 laid in cold water, and af- 
terwaids well washed with soda or pearl- 
ashes in hot water. Just before lieing used 
for a rice, bread, or batter pudding, it 
should be dipped into hot water, wrung, 
shaken, and well dredged with flour ; and 
for a plum, suet pudding, or any sort of 
fruit pudding in paste, it must be buttered 
Ix-tore being floured. 

The water should Ixiil quick when the 
pudding is [Hit in; and it should lx- moved 
about lor a minute, lor fear the ingredients 
should not mix. 

When the |Mi<ldiiu i* done, a pan of cold 
water should lie ready, and the podding 
dip|x-d into it as soon as it comes out of the 
pot, which will prevent its adhering to the 
cloth. 

A bread pudding should be tied loose; 
if batter, it must be tied tight over, and a 
liatter pudding should be strained through a 
vc when all is mixed. In others, 
the eggs only. If you Ixiil the pudding in 
a basin or |,'in, take care that it is always 
well buttered. 

When you make your puddings without 
e^'s, they nrist have ar- little milk as will 
mix, and must Ixiil lor three or four hour?. 
A few s|XHinlnls of small Ix-er, or one of

ding is to be boiled, it must be put on in a 
covered pot, in plenty of boiling water, and 
never for a moment be allowed to be off the 
boil until ready to be served. As the water 
wastes, more, and always boiling, must be 
added. A plum pudding is the better for 
bein;; mixed the day before it is to 1 boiled. 
It may be useful to observe that this pudding 
will keep for months after it is dressed, if 
the cloth be allowed to remain upon it, and 
if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet of 
foolscap paper, and then hung up in a cool 
place. When about to be used, it must l>e 
put into a clean cloth, and again boiled for 
an hour; or it may be cut into pliers, and 
broiled as wanted. If in breaking eggs a 
bad one should accidentally drop into the 
basin amongst the rest, the whole will be 
spoiled ; and therefore they should be broken 
one by one into a tea-cup. When the 
whites only of eggs are required for a jelly, 
or other things, the yolks, if not broken, will 
keep good for three days, if the basin they 
are in be covered. 

A slab of marble, stone, or slate, is pref- 
erable to wood for rolling out paste on. 
The rolling-pin, cutters, and every other im- 
plement used in these processes, must he 
kept particularly clean; thev should alvvavs 
l>e washed immediately alter Iteing used, 
and then well dried. Before using butter 
for (Kiste, it is laid for some time into cold 
water, which is changed once or twiec. 
When salt butter is used, it is well worked 
in two or three waters. If it should not be 
convenient to make the paste immediately 
liefore it. is baked, it will not suffer from 
standing, if made eaily in the morning, and 
the air excluded from it, by putting first a 
tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and 
above that a folded table-cloth. To ascer- 
tain if the oven be of a proper heat, a little 
bit of paste may be baked in it, before any 
tiling else be put in. Puff paste requires 
rather a brisk oven. If too hot it binds the 
surface and prevents the steam from rising, 
and if too slow it becomes sodden and flat. 
Raised crusts require a quick oven; puffs 
and tartlets, which are filled with preserved 
fruit, are sufficiently done when the paste is 
liaked. When large pies have been in the 
oven for a few minutes, a paper is put over 
them to prevent their being burned. 

PUDDING. Sweeten a pint and a half 
of cream, and boil it with the peel of a small 
lemon; cut the crumb of a twopenny roll, 
and put it into the cream, and boil it for 
eight minutes, stirring constantly ; when 
thick add a quarter of a pound of fresh but- 
ter beaten to a cream, a tea-spoonful of gra- 
ted nutmeg, and four well-lieaten eggs; beat

sugar. Prepare your crust, line votu- mould 
with it, put in your apricots, and finish the 
same as in the receipt for Apple Pudding a 
la Francaise. 



ALMOND, BAKED. Steep 

four ounces of crumbs of bread sliced 
in a pint and half of cream, or grate the 
bread; then beat half a pound of blanched 
almonds very fine, till they Ijecome a paste, 
with two tea-sp<xmfnls of orange-flower wa- 
ter; beat up the yolks of eight eirgs, and the 
whites of four; mix all well together; put in 
a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, and stir 
in three or four ounces of melted butter; 
put it over the fire, and keep stirring until 
it is thick ; lay a sheet of paper at the bottom 
of a dish, and" pour in the ingredients. To 
bake half an hour.

lored with a very litl!<- saffron, add it to tile 
eggs and a little flour, knead it well, and 
then put in the almonds, Ix-alini: it up till 
all is mixed together. Boil it for half an 
hour in a buttered cloth. 



AMBER. Put a pound of 

butter into a saucepan, with three-quarters 
of a pound of powder-sugar ; when melted 
and well mixed together, add the yolks of 
fifteen eggs beaten, ami as much candied or- 
ange beaten to a paste as will give color and 
flavor to it. Line the dish with paste for 
turning out, and when lilled \\ith the above, 
lay a crust over, as u>u would a pie, and 
bake in a slow oven. It may be eaten hot 
or cold. 



APPLE. (1) Weigh one 

pound and three-quarters of apples, pan . 
core, and cut them into thin bits; weigh 
also ten ounces of brown sugar; make a 
suet paste, rolled thinner towards the edges 
than in the middle, and Mjtiieiently large to 
lay into a two-quart Ijasin, previously but- 
tered; put in die apple and sugar alternate- 
ly, wet die edges of the pai-te, and lold it 
closely over; dredge it with llour, and tie a 
pudding cloth over the top of a basin; boil 
it for three hours. A li^hl paste may be 
made with flour, half ii.- quantity in bulk of 
grated bread and suei. mixing it with milk 
or water, and, instead of apples, currants, 
damsons, or any otli.-i Ii nil, may be enclos- 
ed in it.

APPLE. (2) Peel and core 

ix very large apples, stew tliem in six ta- 
We-spoonfuls nl" water, with the riml of it 
lemon; wlien sift, Ix-at them to ;i pulp, add 
six ounces <(' melted iVoli butter, the same 
Of good brown j-u^.ir, six well-beaten eggs, 
half :i \\HK-jli-- of l>ntinly, anil a tea-

place them whole in die baiter and bake it. 

APPLE, BOILED. Gimp four 

ounces of beef suet very fine, or two ounces 
of butter, lard, or dripping ; but the suet 
makes the best and lightest crust ; put it 
on the paste-board, with ei^ht ounces of 
flour, and a salt-s|>o<>uful of Kilt, mix it well 
together with your hands, and then put it all 
of a heap, ami make a hole in the middle; 
break one egg in it, stir it well together 
with your finger, and by degrees infuse as 
much water as will make it of a still paste: 
roll it out two or three time*, with the roll- 
ing-pin, and tlien roll it large enough to re- 
ceive thirteen ounces of apples. It will look 
neater if boiled in a basin, well buttered, 
than wlx'n Ixiiled in a pudding-cloth, well 
floured; boil it an hour and three-quarters: 
but tile surest way is to stew tl)e apples first 
in a .-tew pan, with a wine-glassful of water, 
and then one hour ill Uiil it. Some people 
like it flavored with cloves and lemon-peel, 
and sweeten il with two ounces of sugar.

re done, pour them into a dish. 
WUhtthej are cooling inix up three-quar- 
ters of a pound of stiff paste ; then roll out 
14 



half of it to the thickness of die eighth of an 
inch. With Uiis crust line die inside of 
your mould, which must be previously well 
battered. Be careful that tlie paste lays 
i|iiite flat, leaving a piece all round de edge 
of tlie mould, then put in die best quarters 
of die apples, and fill up die mould with the 
rest of the apples and their liquor, then roll 
out die rest of tlie paste very thin, into two 
parts, cut in rounds. Slightly moisten the 
paste which you have left round tlie edge of 
die mould, and place upon it one of the 
rounds of paste, pinching die edges carefully 
together, then slighdy moisten, and place 
upon it your other round piece of paste, 
pinching the edge of this widi the others to 
make it quite close, then cover diem widi 
die lid of die mould well buttered. 

Now, turn your mould over into die mid- 
dle of a napkin, and tie up the corners of it 
close over die top of the dome, and put it

PUDDINGS 



G9OSEBERRY, BOILED. 

This pudding is made in the same manner 
as Apple pudding. 

1M>I\\. (1) It i? a good plan 

to make this pudding the night before. It 
requires a great deal of boiling, say four 
or five hours. Sifted meal and warm milk 
stirred together pretty stiff; salt and suffi- 
cient molasses added. Boil in a stout bag, 
or tiu'litly covered pan; let not the water 
get in, and be careful in tyinu' to leave room 
for the meal to swell. Ix;t the milk you use 
be warm, not scalding. \ou may add 
chop|x,'d suet, which is. very much liked by 
some, and likewise ginger, if preferred. If 
you have not milk, water will answer. 

INDIAN. (2) Boil in a quart of 

good milk a tea-cupfiil of Indian meal, stir 
it constantly till thick, sweeten it with trea- 
cle or brown Miuar, and stir in two well- 
beaten eirus, and an ounce of butter; bake 
it in a Dutch oven for half an hour. Haifa 
grated nutmeg may be added, and it may be 
{8. A boiled Indian meal 
puddinir is made in the same way, and after 
Deng mixed wi;h or without eggs in it, it is 
tied in a buttered and floured cloth, and boil- 
ed for two hours. It is eaten with cold or 
melted butter. 



JELLY. Beat to a light cream 

ten ounces of fresh butter, then add by de- 
grees six well-beaten yolks of eggs, and half 
a pound of loaf sugar pounded ; stir in two 
or three table-spoonfuls of rose water; beat 
to a stiff froth the whites of six eggs, mix 
them in lightly ; bake it five-and-twenty min- 
utes in a dish lined with puff paste. 

JENETON. Butter a mould, 

and ornament it with raisins in festoons, or 
in any other form; line it with sponge bis- 
cuit, and fill it up with a mixture of ratafia 
and sponge biscuit, then pour a rich custard 
over the whole, and let it stand tor two 
hours, adding more custard as it soaks into 
the biscuit. The mould being quite full, tie 
a cloth over it, and boil it for about an hour. 

LEMON. (1) Peel four lemons 

thin; boil them till they are tender; rub 
them through a hair sieve, and preserve the 
fine pulp. Take a pound of \aples biscuits, 
a little grated nutmeg, and two ounces of 
fresh I Hitler, and pour over them some boil- 
in.: milk or cream in whir-h a stick of cin- 
naiii'xi In- lieen Ixiiled. Whi-n cold, mix 
with tin-in lh- |Milp of the Ic-in ms, and eight 
eggs well Ix-ateu; sweeten an-..rding to 

ami it" you choose, add brandy. Edge 
a dish with yood puff paste, put in the mix- 
tine; garnish the top with MI in;:- f paste, 
14* 



as for tartlets, and bake it ia a moderately 
heated oven. 



LEMON. (2) Put half a pound 

of fresh Imtter with half a pound of loaf su- 
gar, into a saucepan, and keep it stirring 
over the fire till it boils; put it into an 
earthen pan, and grate the rind of a large 
lemon into it, and let it stand till cold ; beat 
eight eggs, and squeeze the juice of the lemon 
on them; mix the sugar and butter with 
them ; put some rich puff paste at the bottom 
of a dish, then put in the preparation, and 
add bits of candied lemon-peel when you 
have put in the preparation. Bake with 
great care. 

LEMON. (3) Boil in water, 

in a closely covered saucepan, two large 
lemons till quite tender; take out the seeds, 
and pound the lemons to a paste ; add a 
quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, 
the same of fresh butter ! ream, 

and the yolks of three well-l)eateii e^'.s; mix 
all together, and kike it in a tin lined with 
puff paste; take it out, strew over the top 
grated loaf sugar, and serve it upon a napkin. 

MACARONI. (1) Simmer half a 

pound of macaroni in plenty of water, and a 
table-spoonful of salt, till it is tender; but 
take care not to have it too soft ; though ten- 
der, it should be firm, and the form entirely 
preserved, and no part beginning to melt (this 
caution will serve for tlie preparation of all 
macaroni). Strain the water from it; beat 
up five yolks and the whites of two eg!*s ; take 
half a pint of the best cream, and the < 
of a iowl, and some thin slice- of ham. 
Mince the breast of the fowl with the ham; 
add them with from two to three table- 
spoonfuls of finely-grated cheese, and sea- 
son with pep|>er and salt. Mix all these 
with tlie macaroni, anil put into a pudding- 
mould well buttered, and then let it steam in 
a stewpan of boiling water for about an 
hour, and serve quite hot, with rich gravy 
(as in Omelet). 



MACARONI. (2) Take an ounce 

or two of the pipe sort of macaroni, and 
simmer it in a pint of milk, and a bit of 
lemon-peel and cinnamon, till tender; put it 
into a dish, with milk, three eggs, but only 
one white, some sugar, nutmeg, a spoonful 
of almond-water, and half a glass of raisin 
wine; lay a nice paste round the edge of the 
dish, and jxit it in the oven to bake. If 
you choose you may put in a layer of orange- 
marmaLtde", or raspberry-jam : in this case 
you must not |xit in the almond-water or 
ratafia. 



MARROW. Put into a 



mug 



PUDDINGS 



162 



PUDDINGS 



the crumb of a pound loaf, and pour over it 
a pint and a half of boiling milk ; cover it 
closely for an hour ; cut into small bits half 
a pound of marrow, stone and cut a quarter 
of a pound of raisins, take the same quantity 
of nicely-cleaned currants, beat well six eggs, 
a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, and the 
same of nutmeg/; mix all thoroughly with the 
bread and milk, sweeten it well with brown 
sugar, and bake it, with or without a bor- 
der of puff paste round the dish, three-quar- 
ters of an hour. It may be baked in a 
Dutch oven, and after baking it for three- 
quarters of an hour, put a tin cover over 
the top, and place the dish upon a gridiron, 
over a slow fire, and let it remain for fifteen 
minutes. 



. MILLET. Wash four table- 
spoonfuls of the eed, tisil it in a quart of 
milk with grated nutmeg and lemon-peel, 
and stir in, when a little cooled, an ounce of 
fresh butter; sweeten with brown sugar, 
and add the well-beaten yolks of four, and 
the whites of two eggs, and a glass of wine 
or spirits. Bake it in a buttered dish. 

MY. Beat up the yolks and 

whites of three eggs ; strain them through a 
sieve (to keep out the treddles), and gradu- 
ally add to them about a quarter pint of milk ; 
stir these well together. Rub together in a 
mortar two ounces of moist sugar and as 
much grated nutmeg as will lie on a shilling; 
stir them into die eggs and milk ; then put 
in four ounces of flour, and beat it into a 
smooth batter ; by degrees stir into it seven 
ounces of suet (minced as fine as possible) 
and three ounces of bread crumbs. Mix all 
thoroughly together at least half an hour be- 
fore you put the pudding into the pot. Put it 
into an earthen pudding mould, that is well 
buttered. Tie a cloth over it very tight; 
put it into boiling water, and boil it three 
hours. Half a pound of raisins cut in half 
added to the above, will make a most admi- 
rable plum pudding. Grated lemon-peel is 
also fine. 

Don't let the water cease to boil : it will 
spoil the pudding. And it is always best 
that puddings be mixed an hour or two be- 
fore put into the pot, the ingredients get 
amalgamated, and the whole becomes richer 
and fuller of flavor. 

The above pudding may be baked in an 
oven, or under meat, as \orkshire pudding, 
only add half pint more milk. Should it be 
above an inch and quarter in thickness, it 
will take full two hours; and requires care- 
ful watching; for if die top gets burned, a 
bad flavor will pervade the whole pudding. 
Or, butter some tin patty-pans or saucers, 
fill diem with pudding, and bake alxuit an 
hour in a Dutch oven. 



NASSAU. Put into a sauce- 
pan die whole yolks of eight, and the whites 
of four eggs, half a pound of pounded loaf 
sugar, and one pound of fresh butter; stir it 
over a slow fire for nearly half an hour; line 
a dish with thin puff paste and lay over die 
bottom a diick layer of orange marmalade, 
and then put in the pudding. Bake it for 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

NEW COLLEGE. Haifa pound 

of fresh beef suet, finely minced, the same of 
currants, a quarter of a pound of grated 
bread, and of pounded sweet biscuit, half a 
teal-spoonful of salt, a small nutmeg grated, 
an ounce of candied orange-peel minced; 
mix fill together with two or three well- 
beaten eggs, and fry them in butter till of a 
light brown; shake the pan, and turn them 
frequently till done enough. Serve widl 
pounded loaf sugar strewed thickly over 
diem. 



NEWMARKET. Put on to 

boil a pint of good milk, with half a lemon- 
peel, a little cinnamon, and a bay leaf; boil 
gently for five or ten minutes; sweeten widl 
loaf sugar ; break the yolks of five, and die 
whites of three eggs, into a basin ; beat diem 
well, and add the milk: beat all well togeth- 
er, and strain through a fine hair sieve, or 
tamis : have some bread and butter cut very 
thin; lay a layer of it in a pie-dish, and then 
a layer of currants, and so on till the dish is 
nearly full; then pour the custard over it, 
and bake half an hour. 

NEWCASTLE, OR CABI- 
NET. Butter a half melon mould, or quart 
basin, and stick all round with dried cher- 
ries, or fine raisins, and fill up with bread 
and butter, &c. as in the above ; and steam 
it an hour and a half. 



NOTTINGHAM. Peel six 

good apples; take out the core with the 
point of a small knife, or an apple corer, 
if you have one ; but be sure to leave die 
apples whole; fill up where you took the 
core from with sugar; place them in a pie- 
dish, and pour over them a nice light batter, 
prepared as for batter pudding, and bake 
an hour in a moderate oven. 

OATMEAL. Sift a pound 

of oatmeal, chop three-quarters of a pound 
of suet, mince some onions, and mince all 
together; season well with pcp|>er and salt; 
half fill the skins, and boil and dress diem 
as directed in die receipt for ox-blood pud- 
dings. Some people think a little sugar an 
improvement.

PUDDINGS 



or circles. Cut some thin slices of bread 
without the crust, dry them awhile before 
the fire, butter, and cut them into strips 
about an inch and a quarter wide ; line the 
mould with part of the bread, then put a 
layer of raisins, and strew over a table- 
spoonful of pounded loaf sugar; add a layer 
of the bread and butter; fill the shape nearly 
full, putting bread and butter on the top. 
Mix with a pint of good milk, the well-bea- 
ten yolks of four eggs, a table-spoouful of 
sugar, one and a half of rose-water, and a 
glass of brandy ; pour this over the pudding, 
and let it soak one or two hours. Bake it 
three-quarters of an hour. It may be boiled 
by steam for an hour and a half. 

SQUASH. One good squash 

stewed and well bruised; six large apples 
stewed tender; mix them well together; 
add seven spoonfuls of bread crumbs; half 
pint of milk ; two spoonfuls of rose-water, 
two of wine ; six eggs ; one grated nutmeg ; 
salt and sugar to taste. Beat all together till 
smooth, and put in^a dish lined with puff 
paste. Bake three-quarters of an hour. 

SUET, WIGGY'S WAY. 

Suet, a quarter of a pound; flour, three table- 
spoonfuls; eggs, two; and a little grated 
ginger; milk, half a pint. Mince the suet 
as fine as possible, roll it with the rolling- 
pin so as to mix it well with the flour; beat 
up the eggs, mix them with the milk, and 
then mix all together; wet your cloth well 
in boiling water, flour it, tie it loose, put it 
into boiling water, and boil it an hour and a 
quarter. Mrs. Glasse has it, " when you 
have made your water boil, then put your 
pudding into your pot." 

SUET. Mix six table-spoonfuls of 

grated bread with a pound of finely-minced 
fresh beef suet, or that of a loin of mutton, 
one pound of flour, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, 
six well-beaten eggs, and nearly a pint of 
milk. Boil it in a cloth four or five hours. 
Serve it plain, or with a sweet sauce. 

APPLE SUET. Of finely minc- 
ed fresh mutton suet, grated apples, flour, and 
brown sugar, six ounces each, half a grated 
nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of salt, and four well- 
beaten eggs, all well mixed together; boil- 
ed for two hours, and served with a sweet 
sauce. 

SUET, OR DUMPLINGS. 

Chop six ounces of suet very fine; put it in 
a basin with six ounces of flour, two ounces 
of bread crumbs, and a tea-spoonful of salt; 
stir it all well together: beat two eggs on a 
plate, add to them six table-spoonfuls of 
milk, put it by degrees into the basin, and 



stir it all well together ; divide it into six 
dumplings, and tie them separate, previously 
dredging the cloth lightly with flour. Boil 
them one hour. This is very good the next 
day fried in a little butter. The above will 
make a good pudding, boiled in an earthen 
ware mould, with die addition of one more 
egg, a little more milk, and two ounces of 
suet. Boil it two hours. 

N. B. The most economical way of mak- 
ing suet dumplings, is to boil them without a 
cloth in a pot with beef or mutton ; no eggs 
are then wanted, and the dumplings -are quite 
as light without: roll I hem in (lour Ixioreyou 
put them into the pot ; add six ounces of 
currants washed and picked, and you have 
currant pudding: or divided into six parts, 
currant dumplings; a little sugar will im- 
prove them. 

SWEETMEAT. Slice thin, 

of orange, lemon-peel, and citron, an ounce 
each ; lay them at the bottom of a dish, lin- 
ed with a light puff paste; mix with half a 
pound of butter melted, the yolks of seven 
eggs and the whites of two, and five ounces 
of sugar ; pour this over the sweetmeats, and 
set it in the oven ; it will take rather more 
than half an hour baking. 



TANSY. Pour over a thick 

slice of the crumb of bread a quart of boiling 
milk; cover it till cold. Beat the yolks oi 
four and the whites of two eggs. Pound 
some tansy with two or three leaves of 
spinach; squeeze the juice, and put as 
much of it as will make the pudding a good 
green color, a glass of brandy, half a grat- 
ed nutmeg, and four ounces of fresh butter; 
mix all the ingredients, sweete:i, and put it 
into a saucepan, and stir it over the fire till 
it l>e hot. Bake it iu a buttered dish for 
half an hour. Before serving, strew grated 
loaf sugar over the top. 

TRA.NSl'AUENT. Put eight 

eggs wfll-beaten i;ito a stcwpan with half 
a (xjund of sugar, pounded fine, half a pound 
of butler, and some nutmeg grated. Set it 
on the fire, ami keep constantly stirring till 
it thickens. Ti;e:i set it into a basin to 
cool; put a rich puff paste round the edge 
of the dish; pour in die pudding, and bake 
it in a moderate oven. It will cut light 
and clear. Candied orange and citron may 
be added, if you think proper. 

TAPIOCA. Put four table- 
spoonfuls of tapioca into a quart of milk, 
and let it remain all night, then put a spoon- 
ful of brandy, some lemon-peel, and a little 
spice; let mom boil gently, add four eggs,

over the other side, and press it round with 
the linger and thumb. Or cut the paste into 
tlie form of a diamond, lay on the fruit, and 
fold over the paste, so as to give it a trian- 
gular shape. See Paste.

which in the tine anchovy is mellow, red, 
and liiuli-tl.iMiivd, and the bone in 
oily. Make only as much as will soon be 
used, the ire- her it is the better. 

Put ten or twelve anchovies into a mortar, 
and pound them to a pulp; put this into a 
very clean iron, or silver, or very well 
tinned saucepan; then put a large table- 
spoonful of cold spring-water (we prefer 
good vinegar) into the mortar; shake it 
round, and pour it to die pounded andioviec,

set them by the side of a slow fire, very fre- 
quently stirring them together till they are 
melted, which they will be in the course of 
five minutes. Now stir in a quarter of a 
drachm of good cayenne pepper, and let it 
remain by the side of the fire for a few min- 
utes longer; then, while it is warm, rub it 
through a hair sieve, with the back of a 
wooden spoon. 

, The essence of anchovy, is made with 
double the al>ove quantity of water, as they 
are of opinion that it ought to be so thin as 
not to hang about the sides of the bottle; 
when it does, the large surface of it is soon 
acted upon by the air, and becomes rancid 
and spoils all the rest of it. 

A roll of thin-cut lemon-peel infused with 
the anchovy, imparts a fine, fresh, delicate, 
aromatic flavor, which is very grateful ; this 
is only recommended when you make sauce 
for immediate use; it will keep much better 
without: if you wish to acidulute it, instead 
of water make it with artificial lemon-juice.

RABBITS. (1) Truss your rabbits short, 
lay them in a basin of warm water for ten 
minutes, then put them into plenty of water, 
and boil them about half an hour; if large 
ones, throe-quartan; if very old, an hour: 
smother them with plenty of white onion 
sauce, mince the liver, and lay it round the 
dish, 01 
a boat. 



dish, or make liver sauce, and send it up in 



id lay 
, and 



Obs. Ask those you are going to make 
liver sauce for, if they like plain liver sauce, 
or liver and parsley, or liver and lemon sauce. 

N. B. It will save much trouble to the 
carver, if the rabbits be cut up in the kitchen 
into pieces fit to help at table, and the head 
divided, one-half laid at each end, and slices 
of lemon and the liver, choppa-1 very finely, 
laid on the sides of the dish. 

At all events, cut off the head before you 
send it to table, we hardly remember that 
the thing ever lived if we don't see the head, 
while it may excite ugly idens to see it cut 
up in an attitude imitative of life; ta.-ides, 
for the preservation of the head, the poor an- 
imal sometimes suffers a slower death. 

RABBITS. (2) If your fire is clear 
and sharp, thirty minutes will roast a young, 
and forty a full grown rabbit. When you 
lay it down, baste it with butter, and dredge 
it lightly and carefully with (lour, that yon 
may have it frothy, and of a fine light brown. 
While the rabbit is roasting, boil its liver 
with some pai sley ; when tender, chop them 
together, and put half the mixture into some 
melted butter, reserving the other half for 



garnish, divided into little hillocks. Cat 
off the bead, and lay half on each side of 
the dish. 

Obs. A fine, well-grown (but young) 
warren rabbit, kept sometime after it has 
Ijeen killed, and roasted with a stuffing in 
its tally, eats very like a hare, to the nature 
of which it approaches. It is nice, nourishing 
food when young, but hard and unwholesome 
when old. 

RABBIT, BROILED. Take a couple of 
young rabbits, cut them up, and put them to 
steep for a few hours in a little oil, mixed 
with parsley, leeks, a few mushrooms, and a 
clove of garlic, all shred line, salt and pepper; 
roll eaeli piece of rabbit in a rasher Of bacon, 
and put them, with a part of the seasoning, 
into pieces of white paper; butter the papers 
inside; broil upon a gridiron over a very 
slow fire, and serve hot in the papers. 

RABBITS, IN A FRICASSEE. Take 

two fine white rabbitr, and cut them in 
pieces, by cutting off the legs, shoulders, and 
back; blanch them in boiling water, and 
skim them for one minute; stir a few trim- 
mings of mushrooms in a stewpan over the 
fire, with a bit of butter, till it begins to fry, 
then stir in a spoonful of flour; mix into the 
flour, a little at a time, nearly a quart of 
good consomme, which set on the fire, and 
when it boils, put the rabbits in, and let them 
boil gently till done, then put them into 
another stewpan, and reduce the sauce till 
nearly as thick as paste; mix in about half 
a pint of good boiling cream, and when it 
becomes the thickness of bechamelle sauce 
in general, squeeze it through I ho tammy 
to the rabbits; make it very hot, shake in a 
few mushrooms, the yolk of an egg, and a 
little cream, then serve it to table. Rabbits 
]>IH\ also be preserved, white or brown, in 
the same manner as chickens. 

RABBIT, MINCED. Take the re- 
mains of a roasted rabbit, cut off all the 
meat, and mince it with a little roast mutton. 
Then break the Ixjucs of the rabbit into 
small pieces, and put them into a stewpan, 
with a slice of butter, some shallots, half a 
clove of garlic, thyme, a bay-leaf, and basil; 
give these a few turns over the fire, then shake 
in a little Hour; moisten with a glass of red 
wine, and the same quantity of stock, and 
let it boil over a slow fire for half an hour; 
strain it off, and put in the minced meat, 
adding salt and coarse pepper; heat the 
whole, without boiling, and serve hot: gar- 
nish with fried bread. 

RABBITS IN A MINUTE. Cut your 
rabbits into pieces, wipe them- perfectly dry; 
put a quarter of a pound of butter into a

stewpan, set it on the fire, and when warm, 
put in the rabbit with a little pounded .-pice, 
salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; let the fire 
! brisk, and as goon as toe pieces are 
browned, ;idd a little shred parsley und shal- 
lots, leave it three or four minutes lunger on 
the fire, and then serve. Ten or fifteen min- 
utes are sufficient to cook this dish. 

RABBIT PIE. Git a couple of young 
rabbits into quarters, and bruise a quarter 
of a pound of bacon in a mortal', with the 
livers, some pepper, salt, a little mace, pars- 
ley, cut small, and a few leaves of sweet ba- 
sil ; when these are all beaten fine, line your 
pie-dish with a nice crust, then put a layer 
of the seasoning at die bottom of the dish, 
and put in the rabbits; pound some more 
bacon in a inortur, mix with it some fresh 
butter, -and cover the rabbits with it, and 
over that lay thin si ices of bacon ; put mi the 
cover, and place it in the oven; it will l>e 
done in about two hours ; when baked, take 
off the cover, take out the bacon and skim 
off the fat, and if there is not a sufficient 
quantity of gravy, add some rich mutton or 
veal gravy. 

KAl'.RIT PIE, RAISED. Cut your 
rabbits in pieces, and put them into a stew- 
pan, with a bit of fresh butter, lemon-juice, 

pep|T, salt, [Kirsley, thyme, shallots, chopped 
very line, and a little pounded mace. When 
the pieces of rabbit are alxjut half done, lay 
them on a dish, and when cold, raise the

the rabbit u|>ii it, and more forcemeat ii|xm 
Cover it, and put it in a moderate 
oven to l/ake gently; when done, take oil'

cock's combs, &c., and serve. 

RABBITS, PORTUGUESE. Cutoff 
the heads of a couple of rabbits, turn the 

I tack* upward.", tlie two legs stri|>|xil lit tlie 
end, anil tiu.-.-cd with a couple of skewer.* 
in the same manner as chickens, the u 'up- 
turned like the pinions of a chicken; lard 
and n>a.-t them with good gravy ; if they are 
intended for boiling, they should not !* lard- 
ed, but be served with bacon, and greens, 
or celery sauce. 

RABBITS, POTTED. Take two or 

'ing, but full-grown rabbits, cut them 
up, and take off die leg bones at the thigh, 
season them well with pepprr, mace, cav- 
enne, Kilt, and allspice, all in \er\ lih<-p..w- 

: [Kit them into a .-mall pin, placing 
tin-in as closely together us possible. Make 
the top as smooth a you can. Keep out the 
heads and carcawe*, but take off the meat 
abmit the neck. Put plenty of butler, and 
let tlie whole lake gently. 1-et it n-m.iin in 



the pan for two days, then put it into small 
pots, adding butter. The livers should also 
be put in. 

RABBIT PRESERVED. Having 
boned a rabbit, lard it with bacon and ham; 
season it well inside and out, roll it up, be- 
ginning with tlie legs, make it tight, and 
tie it. Put it into a stew-pan, with some 
oil, thyme, bay-leaf, and basil; set these 
on die fire till done enough (but without 
boiling). When sufficiently cooked, take 
out the rabbit, drain, let it cool, and then 
cut it into small pieces, which put into bot- 
ties; fill them with oil and cover with wet 
bladders. When required for table, take 
them out, cut them into fillets, and place 
on a dish with shred parsley and oil. 

RABBITS PULLED. Half boil your 
rabbits, with an onion, a little whole |XJD- 
per, a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of 
lernon-peel; pull the flesh into flakes; put 
to it a little of the liquor, a bit of butter roll- 
ed in Hour, pepper, salt, nutmeg, chopped 
parsley, and the liver boiled and bruised; 
lx>il this up, shaking it round, and serve. 

RABBITS, ROASTED. Truss them 

lor roasting, and stull them with the liver 
minced raw, grated bread, and ham, butter 
or suet, and chopped parsley, seasoned with 
a little lemon thyme, grated nutmeg, salt, and 
pep|KT,and bound with aliens l alen. Sew 
them up, and roast them Ix-lore a quick fire, 
and baste them with butter. Serve them 
with gravy, or melted butter with lemon 
pickle in "it. Two will take an hour to

and served with a sauce made of die liver 
and some parsley chop|x-d, and mixed in 
melted butter, with a little |>ep|xT and salt, 
or made into a pie tlie same as chickens. 

RABBIT SOUP. Cut an old rabbit 

s, put thnii into a quart of water; 
boil it well, take out all the bones, and beat 
die meat in a marble mortar, as for potting; 
add a little salt, mace, and white pepper, to 
your ta.-ie; stir it into the liquor tlie rabbit 
was boiled in, \\ ith die addition of a very 
little cream. 

.\. B. The meat of die whole rabbit is 
too much for one quart; query, would it 
not be enough for two! 

RABBITS STEWED, WITH A 

BROWN SAUCE, OR WITH A WHITE 
SAUCE. Wash and clean tlie rabbits well, 
let them lie for two or three liours in cold 
water, cut them into joints, wash and dry 
tliem in a cloth, dust them with flour, and 
fry them of a light brown w ith butter, and

stew them in the following sance : Brown 
three ounces of butter in a stewpan, with a 
table-spoonful of flour, a minced onion, some 
pepper and salt ; add a pint of gravy and 
the rabbits, stew them till they are tender, 
and a little before serving, stir in a table- 
spoonfiil of ketchup. When it is wished to 
dress with a white sauce, the rabbits are not 
fried, but stewed in while stock, which is 
seasoned with white pepper, and salt, and 
thickened with a piece of butter mixed with 
flour. A few minutes before serving, a little 
cream is added, and a table-spoonlul of lemon 
pickle. 

RADISHES IN BROTH. Take some 
young radishes, pick and scald them, cut 
them into halves or quarters according to 
their size, and boil them with a slice of ba- 
con in some stock. In a little time take 
them out, drain, and put them into another 
stew-pan, with consomme, or veal gravy, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Let them 
stew gently in this till they are flavored, of 
a good color, and the sauce pretty thick ; 
then serve them. 

RAGOUT POWDER. Two ounces 
of truffles, two of dried mushrooms, the 
peel of a lemon, and the same of a Seville 
orange grated, half a grated nutmeg, half an 
ounce of mace, the same of pepper, and one 
drachm of cayenne, dry them all well before 
the fire, pound tliem to a fine [\vder, add 
one ounce of salt, sift the powder through a 
sieve, and keep it it in a bottle for use. 

RAGOUT OF SNIPES. Pick six or 
eight snipes very nicely, but do not wash 
them ; take out the inside. Roast the birds, 
and cut off all the meat from the breasts, in 
thin slices; pound the bones, legs, and 
backs, in a mortar, and put them into a 
stew-pan, with the juice of a lemon, a little 
flour, and some well-seasoned gravy; boil it 
till it be thick, and well flavored with the 
game, then strain it. Cut half a pound of 
ham into thin long slices, and heat it in a 
little butter, with two minced shallots; put 
it, with the breasts of the snipes, into the 
strained sauce, and let it boil. Pound the 
inside, or trail, with a little salt, spread it 
over thin bite of toasted bread, and hold 
over it a hot salamander. Put the ragout 
upon this, and place the ham round it. 

RAGOUT OF COLD VEAL. Either 
a neck, loin, or fillet of veal, will furnish 
thisexcellent ragout with a very little expense 
or trouble. Cut the veal into handsome cut- 
lets ; put a piece of butter or clean dripping 
into a frying-pan; as soon as it is hot, flour 
and fry the veal of a light brown : take it 
out, and if you have no gravy ready, make 



some as follows: put a pint of boiling water 
into the frying-pan, give it a boil up for a 
minute, and strain it into a basin while yon 
make some thickening in the following man- 
ner: put about an ounce of butter into a 
stewpan ; as soon as it melts, mix with it aa 
much flour as will dry it up; stir it over the 
fire for a few minute? and gradually add to it 
the gravy you made in the frying-pan; let 
them simmer together for ten minutes (till 
thoroughly incorporated) ; season it with pep- 
per, salt, a little mace, and a wine-glassful of 
mushroom ketchup or wine; strain it through 
a tamis to the meat, and stew very gently 
till the meat is thoroughly warmed. If you 
have any ready boiled bacon, cut it in slices, 
and put it in to warm with the meat. 

RAMEQUINS. Take a quarter of a 
pound of Cheshire cheese, scraped, tlie same 
quantity of Gloucester cheese, and beat them 
in a mortar, with a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, the yolks of four eggs, and the 
inside of a French roll, boiled in cream till 
soft; when all i.s lx>aten to a paste, mix it 
with the whites of the eggs, previously beat- 
en, and put tlie paste into small paper cases, 
made rather long than square, and put them 
to bake in a Dutch oven, till of a fine brown, 
They should IK: served quite hot. You mav, 
if you think projjer, add a glass of white wine. 

RASPBERRY CREAM. See Cream. 

RASPBERRY DUMPLINGS. Take 

some good puff paste, roll it out, and spread 
raspberry jam over it ; roll it up, and boil it 
rattier more than an hour; cut it into five 
slices ; pour melted butter into tlie dish, grate 
sugar round, and serve. 

RASPBERRY FRITTERS. Grate 

two \aplcs, biscuits, or the crumb of a French 
roll ; put to either a pint of boiling cream. 
When this is cold, add to it the yolks of four 
eggs, well beaten; beat all well together 
with some raspl>erry juice; drop this in very 
small quantities, into a pan of boiling lard; 
stick them with blanched almonds, sliced. 

RASPBERRY FLUMMERY. Mix 
with half a pint of white wine vinegar one 
pound of raspberries, or one pound of pre- 
served i-asplxTries, let it boil for three or 
four minutes, stirring it ronstanly; s-train 
it through a hair sieve; dissolve one ounce 
of isinglass in half a pint of water; mix 
with it three-quarters of a pound of pounded 
sugar, add it to the strained raspberries 
stir it all well together; boil, and strain it 
through a bit of muslin, and put it into a 
shape. Turn it out when cold.

RICE 



RASPBERRY ICE. Press the juice 
from as many raspberrries as will yield a 
pound and a half; put it into a glazed pan, 
and leave it for four days. Then carefully 
raise the skin that has formed on the top of 
it, pour off the juice into another vessel; 
clarify a |xun<! and a half of sugar, with a 
pint and a half of water, add the juice, and 
give them half a dozen boils; if not suffi- 
ciently red, put in a root of orkanet, which 
leave in till of the proper color; strain the 
preparation through a sieve ; when cold, put 
it into the sabotiere, and freeze it. See Ice. 

I: \SPBERRY SPONGE. Dissolve 
in a little water three-quarters of an ounce 
of isinglass, add to it three-quarters of a 
pint of cream, and the same proportion of 
new milk, nearly half a pint of raspl>erry 
jelly, and the juice of a lemon. Whisk it 
well one wav till ii becomes thick, and looks 
like sponge, then put it into an earthenware 
mould, and turn it out the next day. 

RASPBERRY TART. Line your 
dish with a nice puff paste, lay 
and fruit, put bars across, and bake. 

RASPBERRY TART WITH CREAM. 
Line a patty-pan with thin puff paste, lay 
in some raspberries, and strew sonic very 
finely sifted sugar over them; cover them 
with puff paste, and bake it; when done, 
cut it open, and put in half a pint of cream, 
in which has been previously beaten the \ulks 
of two or three eggs, and sweetened with a 
little wgar; when this is added to the tart, 
return it to the oven five or six minutes. 

RED CABBAGE. Get a fine purple 
cabbage, lake off the outside leaves, quarter 
it, take out the stalk, shred the leaves into 
a colander, s|>rinkle them ith salt, let them 
remain till the morrow, drain them dry, put 
them into a jar, and cover them with the 
pickle for beet roots. 

RED MULLET. Scrape and wash 
them, fold them in buttered paper, lay them 
into a dish, and bake them gently. The 
liquor that comes from them, boil with a 
piece of butter, dusted with flour, a tea- 
spoonful of s<>y, two of essence of anchovy, 
and a little white wine. Serve the sauce in 
:i butler-tureen. This M\ is called the sea 
woodcock, from being dressed with the 



RELISH FOR CHOPS, &c. Pound 
fine an ounce of black |>epper, and half an 
ounce of ;dl.-|>iee, with an ounce of salt, and 
half an ounre of scraped horseradish, and 
the same of eschalots., peeled and quartered; 
put these ingredients into a pint of inusliroom

ketchup, or walnut pickle, and let them steep 
for a fortnight, and then strain it. 

Obs. A tea-spoonful or two of this is 
generally an acceptable addition, mixed 
with the gravy usually sent up for chops and 
steaks, or added to thick melted butter. 

REMOULADE, INDIAN. Pound the 
yolks often hard eggs to a paste, dilute it 
with eight spoonfuls of oil, put in one at a 
time, and continue pounding all the time; 
then add about a dozen allspice, a tea-spoon- 
ful of saffron, four or five spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, salt, and pepper; amalgamate the whole 
perfectly, strain it through a bolting-cloth, 
and sei;\ e it in a sauce tureen. This sauce 
should be rather thick. 

RENNET. (1) As soon as the catf 
is killed, take out the stomach, and scour it 
inside and out with salt, after it is cleared 
of the curd always found in it. Let it drain 
for a few hours, after which sew it up with 
two large handfuls of salt in it, or stretch it 
on a stick well salted; or keep it in the 
salt, wet, and soak a bit, which will do over 
and over by fresh water. 

RENNET. (2) Prepare the maw the 
same as in the above receipt: on the follow- 
ing day, put a handful of hawthorn-tops, a 
handful of sweet briar, a handful of rose- 
leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, 
four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted mar- 
joram, and two large spoonfuls of -alt, into 
two quarts of fresh spring water; let them 
tx.il uiTitly till the water is reduced to three 
pints, then strain it off, and when only milk 
warm, |H>ur it on the maw. Slice a lemon, 
and add to it; in two days, strain it again, 
and put into bottles. Aromatic herbs may 
be put in also; take care that it is sufficient- 
ly salt. If the maw be again salted for a 
few days, and dried as above, it will be 
quite as fit for use as before; it should be 
kept in a cool, dry place. A small quantity 
of the liquid is sufficient for turning. 

RHUBARB TART. Let the stalks be 
of a good size, take off the thin skin, and 
cut them into lengths of four or five inches; 
lay them in a dish, and put over a thin 
sirup of sugar and water; cover with another 
dish, and let it simmer slowly for an boor 
upon a hot hearth, or do them in a block- 
tin saucepan. As soon as cold, make it 
into a tart; wlien tender, the baking the 
crust will l<e sufficient; or you may cut the 
stalks into little hits, the size of gooseberries, 
and make your tart the same as gooseberry 
tart.

possible, till it almost bursts ; tlien add half 
a pint of good milk or thin cream, and boil 
it till it is quite a mash, stirring it the whole 
time it is on the fire, that it may not burn ; 
dip a shape in cold water, and do not dry 
it; put in the rice, and let it stand until 
quite cold, when it will come easily out of 
die shape. This dish is much approved of; 
it is eaten with cream or custard, and pre- 
served fruits ; raspberries are best. It should 
be made the day before it is wanted, that it 
may get firm. This blancmange will eat 
much nicer, flavored with spices, lemon-peel, 
&c., and sweetened with a little loaf sugar, 
add it with the milk, and take outthelemon- 
-peel before you put in the mould. 

RICE, TO BOIL. Wash the rice per- 
fectly clean, and put on one pound in two 
quarts of cold water ; let it boil twenty min- 
utes, strain it through a sieve, and put it be- 
fore the fire; shake it up with a fork every 
now and then, to separate the grains, and 
make it quite dry. Serve it hot. 

RICE CASSEROLE. Take a pound 
and a half of rice, wash it thoroughly in 
several waters (warm), and then put it 
into a saucepan, at least eight inches in 
diameter; moisten it with stock, in this pro- 
portion ; if tlie rice lies an inch thick, let 
the stock come two inches above it, and 
four ladlefuls of fowl skimmings; place the 
eaucepan on a hot stove; when the rice 
boils, set it on the side, and skim it; then 
put it on hot ashes, cover, and let it boil 
slowly lor fifteen to twenty minutes; stir it, 
let it boil as before; in twenty or twenty- 
five minutes, stir it again ; if by this time 
the rice is perfectly soft, take it off, but if 
not, add a little more liquid, and continue 
boiling until it ia so; place the saucepan 
aslant on the side of the stove that the tilt 
may drain awav and be taken off easily. 
As soon as the rice is lukewarm, work it 
into a firm, smooth, paste, with a spatula; 
it can hardly be worked up too much, as 
every grain of rice ought to pass under pres- 
sure (if necessary, add more stuck, a very 
little at a time). When the paste is thus 
thoroughly worked up, form your casserole 
of it, first laving it in a heap, four or five 
inches high, and seven in diameter; do it 
with the hand as you would a raised crust; 
make the ornaments of the outer surface with 
the point of "a knife, or by carrots cut for 
the purpose, taking care that the decorations 
Iv detached from the mass of rice, at least 
nn inch; attention to this particular \\ill 
uot only add to the beauty of the form, Ixit 
t ilie color also, as the raised parts ill be 
lightly colored, while the ground ^ill be 
quite white. When properly formed, mask 
the whole surface with clarified butter, and 



place it in a hot oven for an hour and a half, 
by which time it will Iw of a fine clear yel- 
low. Take oil the top of your casserole, 
clear away all the rice from the inside that 
dues not adhere to the crust (which ought to 
be very thin), ami mix it with bechameHe, 
espagnole, or whatever other sauce may be 
proper, put it in again, and then fill your 
casserole, with such ragouts as your fancy 
may dictate; glaze the surface of the outer 
ornaments, and serve it. Water, with but- 
ter and salt, is frequently thought preferable 
to the stock, Sic., as the rice is thereby 
rendered much whiter. 

RICE CASSOLETTES. The rice 
prepared as above may Iv put into smaller 
moulds, those called dariole moulds, and 
it should be quite cold before it is turned out, 
the mince or whatever is put inside being 
also cold ; it must be put in carefully, that 
none of it may mix with the rice, otherwise 
the cassolettes >vould break in the process 
of frying; for the same reason, the dripping 
must l)e very hot. Frying is the best and 
quickest method of doing them, but they may 
also lie browned in the oven as the casserole 
of rice. 

RICE CHEESE. Boil an ounce of 
rice, thick as hasty pudding, in rather less 
than half a pint of milk (new); pour it hot 
on an ounce and a half of butter, the same 
weight of sugar, mixing it well together; let 
it stand till cold; then add one egg, and the 
yolk of another, and a little white wine. 

RICE CREAM. Mix some rice flour 

with half a glass of cold milk; then by de- 
grees, add a pint more, also cold, and put 
it with a bay-leaf into a saucepan, set it on 
a slow fire for an hour and a half, then strain 
and flavor it with orange-flower water, 
sweeten to your taste, and serve it hot. It 
should he stirred frequently whilst boiling; 
eggs may be added if you think proper. 

RICE CROQUETTES. Wash and 
scald a quarter of a pound of rice, put it 
into a saucepan, with the rind of a lemon, 
shred small, a quarter of a pound of powder- 
sugar, a pinch of salt, a little cris|x-d orange- 
llowei-s, an ounce of butter, and half a pint 
of milk; set these on the fire, and when the 
rice is quite soft, add the yolks of four eggs, 
stir them in over the fire, but do not let them 
Ixiil; pour the preparation on a large tin or 
slab, spread it equally; let it cool, and then 
divide it into small equal parts; roll these 
into balls, dip them into an omelet, roll 
them in bread-crumbs, and fry them in a 
very hot pan. As soon as the croquettes 
are of a nice color, drain, sprinkle them 
with powder-sugar, and serve them.

like other souffles, in this case it should he 
served in a silver dish. In putting the 
preparation into the mould, be careful not 
to fill it, as the rice would swell and run 
over the edge. 

RICE MILK. Allow an ounce of rice 
for each person, wash it thoroughly in warm 
water; set some milk on the fire, and when

not let it boil; when the rice has imbibed 
all the stock, add a sufficient quantity to 
cover the rice, cover, and boil it slowly for 
two hours; in the meantime broil two or 
three slices of beef, and pepper and salt them 
well; when of a nice dark color, throw 
them into the rice soup, to which they will 
impart a rich flavor and a fine color. 

RICE, WHOLE IN A SHAPE. 

Wash a large tea-cupful of rice in .several 
waters, put it into a saucepan with cold 
water to cover it, and when it boils, add 
two cupfuls of rich milk, and boil it till it

The niuiust care is necessary in distilling this 



and all other odoriferous substances. A still 
more powerful essence than the above may be 
procured by tlte following method: Gather 
as many n >M- as will afford thirty pounds of 
leaves, pound these with four pounds of salt; 
when pounded, place the paste in a vessel in 
layers with salt U-tween each, press them 
closely, cork them tight, leave the vessel 
twelve days, and then di-til as usual. 

ROSE-WATER, SINGLE. Put four 
pounds of rose-leaves into a pan, with three 
quarts of river water, and leave it tour-and- 
tvventy lionrs ; then (Mil it into a metal alem- 
bic, and distil from it as much odoriferous 
water as you can, being sure to stop the mo-

SAGE GARGLE. Boil quickly in a 
pint of water, a large handful of sage leave* ;

cover the pan closely, and when reduced to 
one-half, strain it; when cold, mix it with 
the same quantity of Port wine and of vine- 
gar ; sweeten it with honey, or with brown 
sugar. The decoction of sage may be used 
alone as a gargle, or with vinegar and hon- 
ey, without the Port wine; or gargle with 
vinegar and water. 

SAGO. Let it soak for an hour in cold 
water, to take off the earthy taste; pour 
that off, and wash it well ; then add more 
water, and simmer gently until the berries 
are clear, with lemon-peel and spice. Add 
wine and sugar according to taste, and boil 
all up together. 

SAGO MILK. When well cleansed, 
boil it slowly with new milk. A small 
quantity will be sufficient for a quart of milk, 
it swells so much, and when done, it should 
Be reduced to about a pint. It requires 
neither sugar nor flavoring. 

SALAD MIXTURE. Endeavor to have 
your salad herbs as fresh as |xissiblc; if you 
suspect they are not "morning gathered," 
they will be much refreshed by lying an hour 
or two in spring water; then fan-fully wash 
and pick them, and trim off all the worm- 
eaten, slimy, cankered, dry leaves; and, 
after washing, let them remain awhile in 
the colander to drain : lastly, swing them 
gently in a clean napkin: when properly 
picked and cut, arrange them in the salad 
dish, mix the sauce in a soup-plate, and put 
it into an ingredient bottle, or pour it down 
the side of the salad dish, and don't stir it 
up till the mouths are ready for it. 

If the herbs be young, fresh gathered, trim- 
med neatly, and drained dry, and the sauce- 
maker ponders patiently over the follow ing 
directions, he cannot fail obtaining the fame 
of being a very accomplished salad-dresser. 

Boil a couple of eggs for twelve minutes, 
and put them in a basin of cold water for a 
few minutes; the yolks must be quite cold 
and hard, or they will not incorporate with 
the ingredients. Rub them through a sieve 
with a wooden sjnion, and mix them with a 
table-spoonful of water, or line double cream ; 
llie.ii adil two table-spoonfuls, of oil or melted 
butter; when these are well mixed, add, .by 
degrees, a tea-spoonful of salt, or powdered 
lump sugar, and die same of made mustard : 
when these are smoothly united, add very 
gradually three table-spoonfuls of vinegar; 
rub it with the other ingredients till thor- 
oughly incorporated with them; cut up the 
white of the egg, and garnish the top of the 
naiad with it. Let the sauce remain at the 
bottom of the bowl, and do not stir up ihc 
salad till it is to be eaten: we recommend 
the eaters to be mindful of the duty of masti- 



cation, without the due performance of 
which, all undressed vegetables are trouble- 
some company for the principal viscera, and 
some are even dangerously indigestible. 

SALAD, WINTER. Wash very clean 
one or two heads of endive, some heads of 
celery, gome mustard and cresses; cut them 
all small, add a little shredded red cabbage, 
some slices of boiled Iwet-root, an onion, if 
the flavor is not disliked ; mix them together 
with salad sauce. In spring, add radishes, 
and also garnish die disli with them. 

SALINE DRAUGHT. Salt of worm- 
wood, twenty grains; lemon-juice, a table- 
spoonful; water, two table-spoonfuls; mag- 
nesia, twenty grains ; mix it in a tumbler, 
together with a little pounded sugar, and take 
two or three of these in the day. 

SALLY LUNNS. Take three quarts 
of dried flour, half a cupful of yeast, a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter, melted in a sufficient 
quantity of milk to dissolve it, the yolks of 
three eggs, and a little salt: make these in- 
gredients into a light dough, let it stand be- 
fore the fire (covered), for an hour to rise, 
and bake in a quick oven. The above may 
be made into small cakes. 

SALMON. When salmon is fresh and 
good, the gills and flesh are of a bright red, 
tl>< .-rales clear, and the whole fish is stiff. 
Wlien just killed, there is a whiteness be- 
tween the flakes, which gives great firmness; 
by keeping, this melts down, and the fish 
becomes richer. 

SALMON, BAKED. Qean and cut 
the fish into slices, put it in a dish, and make 
the following sauce: Melt an ounce of but- 
ter, kneaded in (lour, in a pint and a half 
of <jra\y, with tun glasses 01 Port wine, two 
table-s|>oonfuls of ketchup, two anchovies, 
and a little cavenne. When the anchovies 
are dissolved, strain and pour the sauce over 
the fish, tie a sheet of buttered paper over 
the dish, and send it to the oven. 

SM.MON, BOILED. Put on a fish- 
kettle, with spring water enough to well 
<-over i he salmon you are going to dress, or 
the salmon will neither look nor taste well: 
(Ixiil the liver in a separate saucepan). 
When the water boils, put in a handful of 
salt; take off the scum as soon as it rises; 
have the fish well washed ; put it in, and if 
it is thick, let it boil very gently. Salmon 
requires almost as much boiling as meat; 
about a quarter of an hour to a pound of 
fish : but practice only can perfect the cpok 
in dressing salmon. A quarter of a salmon 
will take almost as long boiling as half a

Obs. The thinnest part of the fish is 
the fattest ; and if sou have a " grand gour- 
mand" at table, ask him if he is for thick 
or thin. 

N. B. If you have any left, put it into 
a pie-dish, and cover it with an equal por- 
tion of vinegar and pump. water, and a little 
salt: it will be ready in three days. 

SALMON, BOILED I.\ WINE. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt, some slices of ba- 
con, fat and lean together, a pound of veal 
cut thin, and a |xiund and a half of beef; put 
these into a deep stewpan, then a fine piece 
of fresh salmon cut out of the middle, then 
pour in just as much water as will cover it, 
and let it simmer over a gentle fire till the 
salmon is almost done, then |xmr the water 
away, and put in two quarts of white wine, 

with an onion cut in slices, some thy , and 

sweet maijoram, picked from the stalks; let 
them stew sjeiuly, and while they are doing, 
cut a sweetbread into thin slices, then cut the 
slices across, and slew them in a -

just warmed through; e'_ r ^' s-iticc and mashed 
potatoes iitc usually served with it; or it 
may be boiled, especially the bit next the 
liead. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (1) Cut a 

.-almoii into two or three pieces, put it in 
a li-li-kettle, and set it on the fire with a 
Mifticient quantity of water to cover it, am: 
plenty of salt; as soon as it begins to boil, 
set it aside to simmer very gently until done; 
then take it oil' the fire, 'and let it stand in 
the liquor until cold, take it out, lay the 
pieces close together in a tub to pickle, and 
M-.IT them live anchovies, a small quantity 
of pounded saltpetre, and a quarter of a

pint of sweet oil; being thus prepared, put 
the (op of tlie salmon liquor into a stewpan, 
to which add the same quantity of white 
wine vinegar; put it on the fire to skim, 
and boil ii for two or three minutes ; take it 
off, and let it cool. When cold, pour it 
over the salmon and 'tie it down ; in three 
days turn it, and in a week's time it will 
be fit for use ; this is merely in a small way ; 
a great quantity being done at once, requires 
neither oil nor anchovies. Serve garnished 
with fennel. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (2) Cut the sal- 
mon into pieces ; boil it as for eating, and lay 
it on a dry cloth till the following day; boil 
two quarts of good vinegar with one of the li- 
quor the fish was boiled in, one ounce of whole 
black pepper, half an ounce of allspice, and 
four blades of mace. Put the salmon into 
something deep, and pour over it the prepar- 
ed vinegar when cold. A little sweet oil 
put upon tlie top will make it keep a . twelve- 
month. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (3) To a quart 
of liquor the fish has been boiled in, put rath- 
er more than half a pint of good vinegar, and 
half an ounce of whole black pepper; boil 
it, and when it is cold pour it over the fish, 
previously laid in a deep dish. 

SALMON, PICKLED, TO DRESS. 
Soak a piece of pickled salmon all night 
in pump-water; then lay it on a fish-plate, 
and put it in a stewpan, with three spoon- 
fuls of vinegar, a little mace, some whole 
pejjpcr in a bit of muslin, an onion, a nut- 
meg bruised, a pint of white wine, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, some parsley, lemon-peel, 
and a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in 
flour; cover the stewpan very close, and let 
it simmer over a gentle fire for a quarter of 
an hour; then lake up the salmon, lay it in 
a dish, keep it hot liefore the fire; let the 
sauce boil till it is of a proper consistence; 
take out tlie spice, onion, and sweet herbs, 
and serve tlie sauce over die fish. 

SALMON, POTTED. Take off the 
head; cut the salmon in thick slices; wipe it 
dry, but do not wash it; pound half an ounce of 
nutmeg, mace, and cloves, the least part of 
cloves, half an ounce of white pepper, and 
some salt; chop fine one onion, six bay- 
leaves, and six anchovies ; season each slice ; 
put it into a pan, with very thin slices of 
butter between each layer; bake it, when 
well done ; drain off the butter, and, when 
cold, pour over some clarified butler. 

SALMON, TO SALT. Cut the fish up 
the back, and cut out llie bone ; wipe il 
clean, and sprinkle il with salt; let it lay a 



night to drain off the liquor ; wipe it dry ; 
rub on it two or three ounces of pounded 
saltpetre; cut it into pieces; pack it close in 
a pot with a thick layer of salt between each 
layer of fish. If the brine does not rise in 
a few days, boil a strong one, and pour it, 
when cold, upon the salmon, which must 
always be covered with it. 

SALMON, STEW. Clean and scrape 
the fish; cut it into slices, and stew it in a 
rich white gravy. A little before serving, 
add two table-spoonfuls of soy, one of es- 
sence of anchovy, and a little salt, some 
chopped parsley and chives. 

SALMON, SPICED. Mix together, in 
the proportion of one third of salt-and-water to 
one pint of vinegar, one ounce of whole black 
pepper, and one ounce of cinnamon. Cut 
the salmon into slices, and Ixiil it in this; 
when cold, pack it close in a pan, and pour 
over it the liquor it was boiled in, with the 
spices, so as to cover il completely; cover 
tlie pan closely, to exclude tlie air. 

SALMON, MACKEREL, SPRATS, 
HERRINGS, &c. PICKI.KD. Cut tlie fish 
into proper pieces; do not take oil the scales 
make a brine strong enough to lirar an egg, 
in which boil the fish ; it must lie boiled in 
only just liquor enough to cmer it; do not 
overboil it. When the fish is boiled, lay it 
slant iuj;ly to drain off all the liquor; when 
cold, [Kick it eluse in the kits, and till them 
up with equal parts of the liquor the salmon 
was boiled in (having first well skimmed it), 
and best vinegar ; let them rest for a day; 
fill up again, striking the sides <>f the kit with 
a cooper's adz, until the kit will receive no 
more ; then head them down as close as pos- 
sible. 

Obs. This is in the finest condition 
\\lien fresh. Some sprigs of fresh-gathered 
young fennel are the accompaniment*. 

N. 13. The three indispensable marks 
of tlie goodness of pickled s:ilmon are, 1st, 
The brightness of the scales, and their stick- 
ing fast to the skin ; 2dly, The firmness of 
tlie flesh ; and, 3dly, Its fine, pale-red rose 
color. Without these it is not fit to eat, 
and was either stale before ii was pickled, 
or has been kept too long after. 

Tlie above was given us as the actual 
practice of those who pickle it for the Lon- 
don market. 

N. B. Pickled salmon warmed by steam, 
or in its pickle liquor, is a favorite dish at 
Newcastle. 

SALOOP. Boil a little water, wine, 
lemon-peel, and sugar, together; then mix 
with a small quantity of ihe powder, pre- 
viously rubbed smooth, in a little cold water;

tlie fat in the middle of the round, those 
a 1 mut the thick cud of ilw- Hank, &c.: if 
tlieK are not taken out, all the salt in the 
world will not keep the meat. 

Tlie art of salting meat is to rub in tlie 
salt thoroughly and e\enlv into every part, 
and to till all ibe holes full of salt whi-n- llie 
kernel- were taken out, and wliere tlie butch- 

ucrs were. 

A round nf la-el" of 25 |x>unds will take a 

pound and a half of salt to be rubtx-d in all 

In- turned and nibbed 

every day witli die brine; it will be ready 
16 



for dressing in four or five days, if you do 
not wish it very salt. 

In summer, the sooner meat is salted after 
it is killed, the better; and care must be 
taken to defend it from the flies. 

In winter, it will eat the shorter and 
tenderer, if kept a few days (according to 
the temperature of the weather) until its 
fibre lias become short and tender, as these 
changes do not take place after it has been 
acted upon by the salt. 

In frosty weather, take care the meat is 
not frozen, and warm tlie salt in a frying- 
pan. The extremes of lieat and cold are 
equally unfavorable for the process of salting. 
In tlie former, tlie meat changes before the 
salt can ailed it: in the latter, it. is so har- 
dened, and its juices are so congealed, that 
the salt cannot penetrate it. 

If you wish it red, rub it first with salt- 
petre, in tlie proportion of half an ounce, and 
tlie like quantity of moist sugar, to a pound 
of common salt. 

Von may impregnate meat with a very 
agreeable vegetable flavor, by pounding some 
sweet herbs, and an onion with the salt. 
You mav make it still more relishing by ad- 
ding a little ZEST or savory spice. 

SALT PORK, BOILED. See Bacon. 

SAMPHIRE, TO DRY, OR PRE- 
SERVE. Take it in bunches :is it grows ; 
set a large deep stewpan full of water on the 
fire; as soon as it boils, throw in a little 
.-alt, and put in the samphire; when it looks 
of a fine green, remove tlie pan directly from 
die fne, and take out llie samphire with a 
lork; lay it on sieves to drain ; w lien cold, 
lay it on earthen plates, strew sugar well 
over it, next day turn them on a sieve, and 
strew it ajain with su^ar, keep turning dai- 
ly until it is dry; take care tlie stove is not 
too hot. 

SAMPHIRE, TO PICKLE. Lay some 
samphire that is green in a pan, sprinkle 
over it two or three handfuls of salt, and 
cover it with spring water, and let it lay for 
twenty-four hours; then put it into a large 
brass saucepan ; throw in a handful of salt ; 
cover the pan close, and set it over a Tery 
slow fire; let it stand till it is quite green, 
and crisp ; then take it off, for if it becomes 
soft it is spoiled; put it into a jar, cover it 
close, and when it U cold, tie it down. 

S\M)\\ ICIIES FOR TRAVEL- 
LERS. Spread butter, very thinly, upon 
die upper part of a stale loaf of liread cut 

very smooth, and then cut oil die slice; now 
cut oflTanoihrr thin slice, but spread it with 
butter on die under side, without which pre- 
caution tlie two slices of bread will not fit

one another. Next take some cold beet, or 
ham, and cut it into very minute particles. 
Sprinkle these thickly over the butter, and, 
having added a little mustard, put the slices 
face to face, and press them together. Last- 
ly, cot the whole into four equal portions, 
each of which is to lie wrap|)ed'in a separate 
piece of paper. 

SANDWICHES. (1) Cat some bread 
into thin slices, pare off the crust, and spread 
a little butter on them ; cut them nicely into 
oblong pieces, put between each gome bits 
of fowl, and then thin bits of ham, both nice- 
ly trimmed; add a little mustard and .-alt. 
Any cold roasted or potted meat may be used. 
Serve them for luncheon, garnished with 
curled parsley. 

SANDWICHES, (2) Properly prepar- 
ed, are an elegant and convenient luncheon 
or supper, but have got out of fashion, from 
the bad manner in which they are common- 
ly made : to cut die bread neatly with a 
sharp knife seems to be considered the only 
essential, and the lining is composed of any 
offal odds and ends, that cannot be sent to 
table in any other form. Whatever is used 
must be carefully trimmed from every bit of 
skin, gristle, &e. and nothing introduced 
but what you are alisolntely certain will be 
acceptable to the mouth. 

SANDWICHES, CAKE. Cut a sponge 
cake, a few days old, as for bread sand- 
w iches, and spread strawberry jam or cur- 
rant jelly over them. 

SAUCE. (1) Few things require more 
care than making sauce?, as most of tlieui 
should be stirred constantly, the whole atten- 
tion should be directed to them ; the better 
way therefore, is to prepare the sauces before 
cooking those articles which demand equal 
care; they may be kept hot in the bain- 
marie. 

Butler, and those sauces containing eggs, 
ought never to boil. 

The thickest stewpans should be used for 
making sauces, and wooden-spoons used 
for stirring them. 

SAUCE. (2) Mix together a pint of 
vinegar, two shallots or heads of garlic, a 
teu-spoouful of cayenne, three large table- 
spoonfuls of Indian soy or mushroom ketch- 
up, and two of walnut pickle. Let it stand 
a week, shaking it daily; strain, and bottle 
it for use. 



FOR ANY SORT OF MEAT. 

Boil and strain three table-spoonfuls of gra- 
vy, two of vinegar, a blade of mace, a little 
pepper, salt, and a large sliced onion. 



ANCHOVY. Pound three an- 
chovies in a mortar with a little bit of but- 
ter; nib it through a double hair sieve with 
the back of a wooden spoon, and stir it into 
almost half a pint of melted butter ; or stir 
in a table-spoonful of essence of anchovy. 
To the above, many cooks add lemon-juice 
and cayenne. 

APPLE. (1) Pare, core, and 

slice some apples; boil them in water, with 
a bit of lemon-peel; when tender, mash them; 
add to them a bit of butter die size of a 
walnut, and some brown sugar. Heat, and 
serve in a sauce-tureen. 



APPLE. (2) Pare and core 

three good->iwd baking apples; put them 
into a well-tinned pint saucepan, with two 
table-spoonfuls of cold water; cover the 
saucepan close, and set it on a trivet over a 
slow fire a couple of hours before dinner 
(some apples will take a long time slewing, 
others will be ready in a quarter of an hour): 
when the apples are done enough, pour off 
the water, let them stand a few minutes to 
get dry ; then beat them up \\ ith a fork, 
with a bit of butter about as biff ns a nut- 
meg, and a tea-spoonful of powdered sugar. 
N. B. Some add lemon-peel, grated, or 
minced fine, or Ixiil a bit with the apples. 

ATTELETS. Take of finely- 
minced jwrsley, mushrooms, and shallots, a 
table-spoonful each ; fry them with a little but- 
ter, and then dredge in a little flour; moisten 
the mixture with some good stock, season 
it with |X'|>per and salt, and boil it till it 
begins to thicken ; then take it off the tire, 
and add the welUjeaten yolks of two or 

. Stir it well all the time it is 
making. 



BEEF-GRAVY, or Brotcn 

Sauce for Ragout, Game, Poultry, 
Fish, 4'C. If you want gravy immediately, 
see Potato Soup, or (ilaze. If yon have 
time enough, furnish a thick and well-tinned 
stewpan with a thin slice of sail |x>rk, or an 
ounce of butter, and a middling-sized onion; 
on this lay a pound uf nice, juicy gravy 
beef, (as the object in making gravy is to 
extract the nutritious succulence of the meat, 
it must lx: beaten to comminute the contain- 
ing vessels, and scored to augment the sur- 
face to the action of the water) ; cover the 
stewpan, and set it on a slow fire; when 
the meat begins to brown, turn it about, 
and let it get slightly browned (but take 
care it is not at all burned): then pour in a 
pint and a half of lioiliiig water; set the 
pan on the fire; whin it boils, carefully 
catch tlie scum, and then put in a crust of 
bread toasted brown (don't burn it) a

BREAD. (1) Boil, in a pint of 

water, the crumb of a French roll or of a 
slice of bread, a minced onion, a 
whole pepper. When the onion is tender, 
drain off the water, pick out the jiepper- 
corns, and nib the bread through a sieve; 
then put it into a .saucepan, with a gill of

as you did the melted butter, or it will oil. 
Some boil, and mince fine a few leaves of 
parsley, or chervil, or tarragon, and add 
these to the sauce ; others tlie juice of half 
a Seville orange, or lemon. 

Keep the caper bottle \c\y closely corked, 
and do not use any of the caper liquor: if 
tjie capers are not well covered with it, they 
will immediately spoil; and it is an excel- 
lent ingredient in hashes, &c. The Dutch 
use it as a fish sauce, mixing it with melted 
butter. 

CARRIER. Scrape a small 

stick of horse-radish, cut an onion or two 
in thin slices, put these into a sauce-tureen 
with a little vinegar and whole pepper; set 
the tureen in die dripping-pan under a 
shoulder of mutton whilst roasting ; serve 
this sauce quite hot with die meat. 

CELERY, WHITE. Pick and 

wash two heads of nice white celery; cut it 
iuto pieces about an inch long; stew it in a 
pint of water, and a tea-spoonful of salt, till 
the celery is tender ; roll an ounce of butter 
with a table-spoonful of flour; add this to 
half a pint of cream, and give it a boil up. 

CELERY PUREE, for boiled 

Turkey, Veal, Fowls, fyc. Cut small 
half a dozen heads of nice white celery dial 
is quite clean, and two onions sliced; put 
in a two-quart stewpan, with a small lump 
of butter : sweat them over a slow fire till 
quite tender, then put in two spoonfuls of 
nour, half a pint of water (or beef or veal 
broth), salt and pepper, and a little cream or 
milk ; boil it a quarter of an hour, and pass 
through a fine hair sieve with the back of a 
spoon. If you wish for celery sauce when 
celery is not in season, a quarter of a drachm 
of celery seed, or a little essence of celery, 
will impregnate half a pint of sauce with a 
sufficient portion of die flavor of the vege- 
table. 

CHESTNUT, FOR ROAST 

TURKEY. Scald a pound of good chest- 
nuts in hot water for five minutes, skin diem, 
and stew them slowly for two hours in white 
stock, seasoned and diickened with butter 
and flour. Cut a pound of pork sausages 
into bits alxmt an inch long, dust them with 
flour, and fry them a light brown ; lay diem 
into the dish on which die turkey is to be 
served, and pour the chestnuts and sauce 
over them. Some people prefer die fried 
sausages stewed a little with the chestnuts ; 
but diis mediod makes die sauce of a darker 
color. 

CURRANT, FOR VENISON. 

Boil in water for a few minutes an ounce of 



nicely-cleaned currants, add direc table* 
s|xx>nfuls of grated bread, a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, four cloves, and a glass 
of Port wine; stir it till it boil, and serve it 
hot. 

CURRY, Is made by stirring a 

sufficient quantity of curry powder, into gra- 
vy or melted butter, or onion sauce, or onion 
gravy. The compositions of curry powder, 
and the palates of those who eat it, vary so 
much, that we cannot recommend any spe- 
cific quantity. The cook must add it by 
degrees, tasting as she proceeds, and take 
care not to put in too much. 

DUTCH. (1) Beat up the yolks 

cf six rii3, mix in a little flour, cream, salt, 
and lemon vinegar. Strain it through a 
sieve, add a small piece of fresh Ixitter, two 
blades of pounded mace, and a little pepper. 
Put it into a saucepan, and stir it till it 
is almost boiling. 



DUTCH. (2) Put into a stewpan 

a tea-spoonful of flour, four table-spoonfuls of 
elder vinegar, a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, the yolks of five eggs, and a little 
salt ; keep stirring it over die fire, and work 
it well till thick. If it be not curdled, it 
will not require to be strained. Season 
with pepper. 

DUTCH, FOR FISH OR BOIL- 
ED FOWLS. Mix, with two ounces of 
fresh butter, one tea-spoonful of flour, two 
table-spoonfuls of cold water, tlio same 
quantity of vinegar, and one well-beaten 
egg; put it into a saucepan, and stir it over 
the fire till it be quite hot, but do not allow 
it to boil. 



EGG. (1) This agreeable accom- 
paniment to roasted poultry, or salted fish, 
is made by putting three eggs into boiling 
water, and boiling diem for alx>ut twelve 
minutes, when they will be hard; put them 
into cold water till you want them. This 
will make the yolks firmer, and prevent 
their surface turning black, and yon can rut 
diem much neater: use only two of the 
whites, cut the whiles into small dice, tlie 
yolk? into bits aliout a quarter of an inch 
square; put them into a sauce-boat ; pour 
to them half a pint of melted butter, and 
stir them together. 

If you are for superlative egg sauce, 
pound the yolks of a couple of eggs, and rub 
them with the melted butter to thicken it. 

N. B. Some cooks garnish salt fish with 
hard-boiled eggs cut in half.

pieces, mix them with melted butler, and 
heat it well. 



ESCHALOT. Take fmr es- 
chalots. ;uiil make it in the same manner as 
garlir since. Or, you may make this sauce 
more e\lem|x>raiieoiisly by putting: two table- 
spoonl'uls of eschalot wine, ami a sprinkling 
of |x-p|x-r ami nail, into (almost) half a pint 
of thick melted butter. This is .m excellent 
sauce for chops or steaks; many are very 
fond of it with roasted or boiled meat, 
poultry, &c.

of a lemon, cut very thin. When cold, put 
the whole into a bottle, cork it tightly, and 
shake it well before using. 



FOR FISH. (1) The melted 

r lish. should l- thick enough to ad- 
bere to llie fish, and, therefore, must be of the 
thickness of light batter, at it is to be dilut- 
ed with essence of ancho\y, soy, mushroom 
ketchup, cayenne, or Chili vinegar, lemons 
or lemon-juice, or artificial lemon-juice, &c. j 
which are e\|>ected al all well-served tables, j 
Cooks, who are jealous of the reputation of : 
their i.i-ie, and housekeepers who value their

there are qnin- as many reasons why they 
nhould, as UH-I-C are for the preference usually 
l_'H'"i in home-baked bread. and home-brew- 
fd lx-T. The liver of tin- lish pounded and 
mixed with parsley and butter, with a little 
lemon-juice, ike. is an elegant and inoffensive 
relish to lish. 



!'< )R FISH. (2) Two wine-gbss- 

i, and two of walnut pickle, four of 
mushroom ketchup, half a dozen anchovies, 
|v>uiidcd, the like number of eschalots sliced 



and pounded, a table-spoonful of *oy, and 
half a drachm of cayenne pepper ; let them 
simmer gently for ten minutes ; strain it, and 
when cold, put it into bottles, well corked, 
and sealed over, it will keep for a considera- 
ble time. 

Obs. This is commonly called Quin's 
sauce.

bruised, and one table-spoonful of floor of 
mustard. Boil these togetlier about fifteen 
or twenty minutes; when cold, strain and 
bottle it, waxing the corks. It will keep

lemon thyme, or sweet marjoram ; cover up, 
and let it simmer gently for half an hour. 

Slice half an ounce of onion, and put it 
into a stewpan with an ounce of butter ; fry 
it over a sharp fire for about a couple of 
minutes, till it take* a little color; then stir 
in as much flour as will make it a stiff

vy), which some toast and cut into triangles. 
Vmi may garnish it with fried bread sippets. 

N. B. To hash meat in perfection, it 
should be laid in this gravy only just long 
enough to get properly warm through. 

O6t. If any of the gravy that was sent 
up with, or ran from the joint when it was 
roa.-ied, l>e left, it will be a great improve- 
ment to the hash. 

If you wish to make mock venison, instead 
of the onion, put in two or three cloves, a 
table-spoonful of currant jelly, and the same 
quantity of claret or Port wine, instead of 

the ketchup. 

You may make a curry hash by adding 
some curry jam.

ped parsley, grated horseradish, or young 
onions minced, or burnet, horseradish or 
tarragon, or elder vinegar, &c., and cay- 
enne or minced pickles, capers, &c. This 
is a piquante relish for lobsters, crabs, cold 
lush, &c. 

SALAD OR PIQUANT, FOR 

COLD MEAT, FISH, &c. Pound together 
an ounce of scraped horseradish, half an 
ounce of salt, a table-spoonful of made mus- 
tard, four drachms of minced eschalots, 
half a draclun of celery seed, and half ditto 
of cayenne, adding gradually a pint of bur- 
net, or tarragon vinegar, and let it stand in 
a jar a week, and then pass it through a 
sieve. 



POIVRADE, FOR COLD 

MEAT. (1) Chop finely six shallots and a 
handful of picked and washed parsley ; mix 
with it a little vinegar, mustard, cayenne 
some cold gravy, and salt.

MEAT. (2) Bruise the yolk of a hard- 
boiled egg with a little salt and mustard, 
oil, soy, chopped parsley, and chives, and 
pour it over slices of any cold meat. 

PUDDING. Mix with half a 

pint of melted butter two wine-glasses of 
sherry, and a table-spoonful of pounded 
loaf sugar; make it quite hot, and serve in 
a sauce-tureen, with grated nutmeg on the 
top. 

QUIN'S. (1) Half a pint of 

mushroom pickle, the same of walnut pickle, 
three whole and three pounded cloves of 
garlic, six anchovies bruised, and a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne. Mix all together in a 
large bottle, shake it daily lor three weeks, 
then strain, and bottle it for use. 



QUIN'S. (2) One pint of 

Port wine, one of mushroom ketchup, one 
of walnut liquor, one of essence of ancho- 
vies, and a tea-spoonful of cayenne; mix 
all together, and boil it for a quarter of an 
hour. If essence of anchovies, i.s not to be 
had, boil half a pound of anchovies in a 
quart of water till reduced to a pint. Strain, 
and use it. 



REVEREND. Chop up some 

lemon-peel, and two or three piokled cu- 
cumbers; put them into a stewpan with 
two spoonfuls of cullis, a little butter rolled 



in flour, season with salt and pepper, put 
it on the fire, and make it quite hot without 
boiling, stirring all the time, make a liaison 
with yolks of eggs, and serve. 

RICE. Steep a quarter of a 

pound of rice in a pint of milk, with uiion, 
pepper, &c. as in the last receipt; when 
the rice is quite tender (take out the spice), 
rub it through a sieve into a clean stcwpan: 
if too thick, put a little milk or cream to it. 

Obs. This is a very delicate white 
sauce; and at elegant tables is frequently 
served instead of bread sauce. 



FOR ROAST BEEF. (1) Mix 

well together a large table-spoonful of 
finely-grated horseradish, a dessert-spoon- 
ful of made mustard, and half a one of 
brown sugar, then add vinegar till it I e as 
dn'ck as made mustard. Serve in a sauce- 
tureen. 

FOR ROAST BEEF. (2) Put 

into a stone jar one gill of soy, two of vine- 
gar, two of water, a good-sized stick of 
horseradish, and two sliced onions. Cover 
the jar closely, and set it into a pan of cold 
water ; when it boils, let it simmer for two 
or three hours. 



ROBART, FOR BEEF STEAKS 

OR MUTTON CHOPS. Put into a saucepan 
a little gravy, two ounces of butter dredged 
with flour, a small slice of raw ham, and 
two or three minced onions ; when the on- 
ions are browned, dust in a little more 
flour, and add nearly a pint of gravy, a lit-

of a hard-boiled egg with a small tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, then add a dessert-spoonful of 
mustard, and stir in gradually a large table- 
spoonful of olive oil, oiled butter, or cream, 
then by degrees mix in two or three table- 
tpoonUiU of vinegar; serve it in a sauce- 
tureen, or mix it with the salad. Instead 
of the hard eijij, sonic persons prefer the 
fuuce made with the yolk raw.

SALAD. (2) Rub smooth a 

hard-boiled egg, beat well a ra\* egg, and 
mix them together with a little water, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, one of cayenne, one of

Peeled and sliced eschalots, the same. 
Scraped horseradish, ditto. Allspice, and ' 
black |iepper powdered, half an ounce each.

these into a wide-mouthed bottle, stop it 
clo-e, shake it up every day for a fortnight, 
and strain it (when some think it improved 
by the addition of a quarter of a pint of sov, 
or thick browning), and you will have a 
"delicious double relish." Dr. Kitchinrr 
says, this coni|Hisition is one of the " chels 
d'n-uvrc " of iiianv experiment! he has made, 
lor tic- purpose of enabling the good house- 
wives of Great Britain to prepare their own

iramr-, poultry, or ragouts, &c., and as a 
lair lady may make it herself, its relish will 
Ix; not a little augmented, by the certainty 
that all the ingredients are good and whole- 

Obs. Under an infinity of circumstances, 
a cook may Ix- in want of" the substances ne- 
cessary to make sauce: the above composi- 
tion of tlie several articles from which tiic 
jiavies derive their flavor, will br 
found a vei-y admirable extemporaneous sub- 
stitute. By mixing a large table-spoonful 
with a quarter of a pint of thickened melted 
. broth, five minutes will finish a 
luat of very relishing .-ance, nearly equal to 
drawn gravy, and as likely to put your lin- 
gual nerves into good humor as any thing 1 
know. 

To make a boat of sauce for poultry, &c. 
put a piece of butter about as big as an egg 
into a stewpan, set It on the fire; when it 
is in. -lied, jit to it a table-sixionful of flour; 
stir it thoroughly together, and add to it 
two table-spoonfufs of sauce, and by degrees 
almut half a pint of broth, or boiling water, 
let it simmer gently over a slow fire for a

few minutes, skim it and strain it through a 
sieve, and it is ready. 

FOR STEAKS, CHOPS, OR 

CUTLETS. Take your chops out of the 
frying-pan; for a pound of meat keep a ta- 
ble-spoonful of the fat in the pan, or put in 
about an ounce of butter; put to it as much 
limn as will make it a paste; rub it well 
together over the fire till they are a little 
brown ; then add as much boiling water as 
will reduce it to the thickness of good cream, 
and a table-spoonful of mushroom or walnut 
ketchup, or pickle, or browning; let it boil 
together a few minutes, and pour it through 
a sieve to the steaks, &c. 

Obs. To the above is sometimes added 
a sliced onion, or a minced eschalot, with 
a table-s|x>onful of Port wine, or a little 
eschalot wine. Garnish with finely-scraped 
horseradish, or pickled walnuts, gherkins, 
&c. Some beef-eaters like chopped escha- 
lots in one saucer, and horseradish grated 
in vinegar, in another. Broiled mushrooms 
are favorite relishes to beef steaks. 



SWEET, FOR VENISON OR 

HARE. Put some currant jelly into a 
stewpan ; when it is melted, pour it into a 
sauce-boat. 

N. B. Many send it to table without 
melting. 

Tliis is a more salubrious relish than 
either spice or salt, when the palate pro- 
tests against animal food unless its flavor be 
masked. Currant jelly is a good accom- 
paniment to roasted or hashed meats. 



SWEET. Put some cinnamon 

into a saucepan, with as much water as 
will cover it ; set it on the fire, and when it 
has boiled up once or twice, add two 
spoonfuls of powder sugar, a quarter of a pint 
of white wine, and two bay -leaves; give 
the whole one boil, and then strain it for 
table. 



TART ARE. Pound in a mor- 
tar three hard yolks of eggs ; put them into 
a basin, and add half a table-spoonful of 
made mustard, and a little pepper and salt; 
pour to it by degrees, stirring it fast all the 
while, about two wine-glassfuls of salad oil; 
stir it together till it comes to a good thick- 
ness. 

N. B. A little tarragon or chervil minc- 
ed very fine, and a little vinegar, may be 
added. 



TOMATA. See Tomata. 

TOURNEE. To a little white 

thickening add some stock drawn from the 
trimmings of veal, poultry, and ham; do 



not make it too thick. Boil it slowly with 
a few mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, and 
some green onions; strain and skim it well, 
and use it as required. German sauce is 
made as the saure tournee, adding the beat-- 
en yolks of two or mure eggs, and is used 
fi>r ragouts, fricassees, and any made dish 
which may require a rich white sauce. 

WHITE. Thicken half a pint 

of cream with a little Hour and butter, four 
shallots minced, a little mace and lemon- 
peel; let it boil, and a little before serving, 
add a spoonful of white wine, the well-beaten 
yolk of an egg, the squeeze of a lemon, and 
a tea-spoonful of anchovy liquor. This sauce 
will answer for boiled fowls, or for a fricas- 
see. 



WHITE, FOR FOWLS OR 

TURKEY. Put on, in a quart of water, 
the necks of fowls, a piece of the scrag-end 
of a neck of mutton, two blades of mace, 
twelve peppercorns, one anchovy, a small 
head of celery, a slice from oft" the end of a 
lemon, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; cover it 
closely, and let it boil till reduced to nearly 
half a pint; strain, and put to it a quarter 
of a pound of butter divided with flour; let 
it boil for five minutes, and then add two 
spoonfuls of pickled mushrooms. Mix with 
a tea-cupful of cream, the well-beaten yolks 
of two eggs, and some grated nutmeg; stir 
this in gradually, ami shake the pan over 
the fire till it is all quite hot, but do not al- 
low it to boil. 



WHITE ITALIAN. Peel 

some mushrooms, and throw them into a 
little water and lemon-juice, to keep them 
white. Put into a stewjian two-thirds of 
sauce tournee, ami one-third of good veal 
stock, two lable-spoonfula of finely-chopped 
mushrooms, and half a table-spoonful of 
washed and chopped shallots; let it boil till 
well flavored, ami then serve it. The 
mushrooms should be as white as possible. 



WHITE SHARP. Boil with 

a little tarragon, or tarragon vinegar, if the 
tarragon is not to be had, four table-spoon- 
fuls of white wine vinegar, and about twen- 
ty peppercorns ; reduce this to one-fourth, 
and add it to six table-spoonfuls of sauce- 
tournee, and two of good stock; boil and 
strain it; put it again on the fire, and thick- 
en it with the beaten yolks of two eggs, a 
small bit of butter, a little salt and cayenne. 
Just before serving, stir in a spoonful of

mix the fat and lean together, and put it in- 
to ox-guts, tie up the ends, and lay the 
sausages in a pan of water, with salt, and 
saltpetre ; cover the pan close, and leave it. 
In a week's time take out the sausages 
and drain them. Tie them between two 
pieces of wood, hang them up to dry, and 
smoke. When dry, untie them, and rub 
each over with oil, and the ashes of vine- 
twigs, mixed together. Keep them in a 
dry place. 

SAUSAGES, ROYAL. Mince small 
the meat of a partridge, a capon, or pullet, 
a piece of gammon, and other bacon, and 
a bit of leg of veal ; shred also some parsley, 
chives, truffles, and mushrooms; mix these 
all together, and season with pepper, salt, 
beaten spice, and garlic; bind the whole 
with the yolks of six, the whites of two eggs, 
and a little cream ; when thoroughly mixed, j 
roll the preparation into thick pieces, which 
wrap in very thin slices of fillet of veal, well 
beaten with a rolling-pin; each sausage 
should be about the thickness of a man's 
wrist, and of proportionate length. Line an 
oval stewpan with slices of bacon and thin 
beef steaks, put in the sausages, cover them 
with beefsteaks and bacon, shut the stew- 
pan very close, and set it on a moderate 
fire, put hot embers on the lid, and let it 
stand ten or twelve hours ; then take it off, 
and when cold, take out tlie sausages care- 
fully, remove the veal, and all the fat, with 
a sharp knife cut them into slices, and serve 
cold. 

SAUSAGES, SPREADBURY'S. Cut 
from the leg or griskin one pound of nice 
lean pork, free from sinews and skin, mince 
it very finely : mince one pound of the best 
beef suet, mix it with the pork, and pound 
it as finely as possible in a marble mortar; 
add two large table-spoonfuls of stale bread 
rnbted through a sieve, also a good deal of 
pepper, salt, and a little finely-chopped sage, 
mix all together with the yolks of two eg^s 
beaten up. It will keep for sometime, if 
put into an earthen jar and pressed closely 
down. When it is to be used, make it into 
rolls, and as thick as common sausages, and 
three or four inches long: dust them with a 
little flour; have ready a frying-pan made 
very hot, and fry them without any thing 
but their own fat, till they are done quite 
through, taking care not to make them too 
dry. By breaking one of them, the cook 
will know whether they are sufiiciently 
done. They may be fried in lard or fresh 
Iwef dripping.

Scotch barley in a little cold water; put it 
in a soup-pot with a shin or teg of beef, of 
about ten pounds weight, sawed into four 
pieces (tell the butcher to do this (or you) ; 
cover it well with cold water; set it on the 
fire: when it boils skim it very clean, and 
put in two onions of about three ounces 
weight each ; set it by the side of the fire to 
simmer very gently about two hours ; then 
skim all the fat clean ofl", and put in two lieads 
of celery, and a large turnip cut into small 
squares; season it with salt, and let it boil 
an hour and a half longer, and it is ready: 
take out the meat (carefully with a slice, 
and cover it up, and set it by the fire to keep 
warm), and skim the broth well before you 
put it in the tureen. 

SCOTCH BROSE. This favorite Scotch 
dish is generally made with the liquor meat 
has been boiled in. Put half a pint of oat- 
meal into a porringer with a little salt, if 
there be not enough in the broth, of which 
add as much as will mix it to the consistence 
of hasty pudding, or a little thicker; lastly, 
take a little of the fat that swims on tlie 
broth, and put it on the crowdie, and eat it 
in the same way as hasty-pudding. 

Obs. This Scotsman's dish is easilv pre- 
pared at very little expense, and is pleasant- 
tasted and nutritious.

milk ; much used by those patterns of com- 
bined industry, frugality, and temperance, 
the Scottish peasantry; and diis, among 
other examples of the economical Scotch, is 
well worthy of being occasionally adopted 
1>\ all who have large families and small in- 
comes. It is made in the following easy and 
expeditious manner : To a quart of oatmeal

add gradually two quarts of water, so that 
the whole may smoothly mix : then stirring 
it continually over the fire, boil it together for 
n quarter of an hour ; alter which, tike it up, 
and stir in a little salt and butter, with or 
without pep|X.-r. This quantity will serve a 
family of five or six persons for a moderate 
meal. 

SCOTS COLLOPS. Cut some very 
thin slices of beef; rub with butter die bot- 
tom of an iron stewpan that h,i- a cover to 
fit quite closely; put in tlie meat, some pep- 
per, and a little silt, a large onion, and an 
apple minced very small. Cover the stew- 
)an, and let it .-immer till the meat is very 
tender. Serve it hot. 

SCOTCH DIMPLING. Make a paste 

with some iiatmcal and butter, form it into 
a dimpling, anil place a haddock's liver 
in tlie middle, well seasoned with pepper 
and salt; it should be boiled in a cloth. 

SCOTCH HAGGIS. Make the ha-is-

boil the liter very well, so as it will :.'i,iie; 
dry the meal before tlie fire; mince the 
draught and a pretty large piece of beef very

SCOTCH SHORT BREAD. Take; 
two pounds of Hour, dry, and sift it well; 



then mix with it a pound of powder-sugar, 
three ounces of candied citron and orange- 
peel cut into dice, and half a pound of cara- 
way comfits ; put half a |K>und of butter into a 
saucepan, set it on the fire, and when quite 
melted, mix it with the (lour, &c. ; i 
Ix'iug nicely made, roll it out to the thickness 
of half an inch, cut it into cakes, lay them 
on white paper, prick and bake them ; they 
should be of a pale color. 

SEA CALE, BOILED. Let it liesome- 
time in cold water, dien clean and trim it 
nicely, cutting off any part that may be at 
all green, and parting it as little as possi- 
ble. Put it on in boiling water, with a lit- 
ii.- -.di. Let it boil half an hour ; drain off 
tlie water. Pare die crust off a slice of 
t. >asted bread, lay it in tlie dish, pour over 
it a little melted butter, and serve the cule 
upon it. 

SEED CAKE. Sift two and a half 
pounds of Hour, with half a pound of good 
white or loaf sugar, pounded into a pan or 

Ixiwl ; make a ca\ ity in the centre, and [xiur 
in half a pint of lukewarm milk, and a ta- 
ble-poonful of thick yeast; mix, tlie milk 
with enough (lour to make it as 
thick as cream (this is called setting a 
swinge); set it by in a warm place for one 
hour; in the meantime, melt to an oil half a 
pound of fresh butter, and add it to die other 
ingredients, with one ounce of caraway- 
seeds, and enough of milk to make it of a 
middling stillness ; line a hoop with paper, 
well rubbed over with butter; put in the

fried quite plain, and when cut into slices, 
should be washed in milk and water. 

SHEEP'S MINCE. Wash the heart 
and lights very clean ; tail them alxiiit half 
an hour; mince them finely ; mix a piece of 
butter with Hour, brown it in a stewpan, and 
add some of the liquor the heart and limits 
were boiled in. Put in the mince with some 
chopped onion ; season with salt and pepper, 
cover it closely, and let it stew half an boor. 
Before serving, add a table-spoonful of mush- 
room ketchup. 

SHEEP'S TONGUES, BROILED. 

Having parboiled the tongues in a little 
stock, split each, give them a few turns in 
some melted bacon, strewing over them salt, 
pepper, shred parsley, and bread crumbs; 
when well covered with the latter, lay diem 
oil a gridiron, and broil Uiein slowly. 

SHEEP'S TONGUES PIE. Line a 
dish with some good puff paste, and lay at 
tile bottom of the dish some good forcemeat, 
made of rousted poultry, suet, parsley chop- 
|K-d, mushroom?, |>epper and salt, and a few 
line spices; upon this place the tongues cut 
in two, and upon them a good slice of ham, 
a little butter, and a few slices of bacon; 
put on the cover and bake it; when done, 
take out the bacon and ham, skim off all the 
fat, and pour on it what sauce you please. 

SHEEP'S TONGUES ROASTED. 
Take half a dozen sheep's tongues, and hav- 
ing properly prepared them, lard them with 
small lardons, tie them to a skewer, wrap 
a buttered paper round, and fasten them on 
a spit, and roast them before a moderate 
fire; a little before they are done, take off 
die paper, baste the tongues with butter, 
and make them of a nice color. Serve with 
whatever sauce you may prefer. 

SHEEP'S TROTTERS STUFFED. 
Boil the feet in good stock till die bones 
will come out with ease ; fill tlie space left 
by them with a good fowl or chicken farce; 
dip them in lard, bread them well, and bake 
in a moderate oven. The space left by die 
bones is sometimes filled up with a bit of 
fried bread ; in this case die feet are only 
previously boiled, and then served with 
cream sauce. 

SHEEP'S TROTTERS FRIED. Clean 
some sheep's trotters nicely, scald and wash 
them in hot water; stew them in that sauce 
in which CALF'S HEAD PLAI.N is boiled, 
and bone them. Fry, but not till brown, 
iu a little butter, some carrots, onions, a 
Hide parsley roots, all cut small, thyme, a 
shallot, a small bay leaf, and a clove. When 



they begin to color, moisten them with wa- 
ter ;md viwgar mixed in equal parts, and let 
it all stew till the vegetables are quite ten- 
-"ii with pepper and salt, and strain 
it through a silk sieve over the sheep's trot- 
t MS, then fry the- trotters in this batter; put 
nearly four table-spoonful:; of flour into aft 
earthen pan, with a little salt, a little olive 
oil, and as much good brer or water as will 
moisten the paste ; when well mixed, add 
(he beaten whites of two eggs, dip the trot- 
ters into this, and fry them instantly. The 
marinade cuite, or pickle, into which the 
trotters are laid, and the paste in which they 
are fried, may be used for beef, and other 
meats. The same receipt may be followed 
exactly for calf's feet. 

SHERBET. Tliis is a delicious bever- 
age, composed of cream, mixed with various 
articles, such as almonds, tea, pistachios, 
coffee, chocolate, &c., and snsrar, and then 
iced. Sherbet may also be made with the 
juice of various fruits, sweetened to the 
taste. When the liquid is sufficiently lim- 
pid and cold, pour it into a silver, or tin 
sorbetiere, and ice it as usual. 

SHERBET, TURKISH. Wash a small 
fore quarter of veal, put it on the fire with 
nine pints of water; skim it well, and let it 
boil till reduced to two pints ; nin it through 
UK! when cold, add to it a pint and 
a half of clear lemon-juice, and two pounds 
<'f loaf MI gar which has been made into a 
sirup widi a pint and a half of water, and 
cleared with the white of an egg. It is 
served in glass mugs for a dessert table, or 
offered at any oUier time as a refreshment. 

SHRUB. (1) One measure of lemon- 
: juice is allowed to five of mm, and to every 
gallon of the mixture, six pounds of loaf su- 
gar, which is to l>e melted in water, and the 
whole strained through flannel. 

SHRUB. (2) To one part of lemon- 
juice, three of good orange are allowed, 
and, to every pint of juice, a pound and a 
half of very finely-pounded loaf sugar ; these 
being well mixed, it is put into a cask, and 
one quart of the best rum added to each pint 
of the juice; the whole to be shaken three 
times a-day for a fortnight, or longer, if the 
cask IK: large. It is then allowed to stand 

1 to fine for a month, or till it be sufficiently 
clear to Ixittle. The dregs may be made 
into excellent milk punch, by pouring warm, 
but not boiling, milk on them, allowing diree 

', parts of milk to one of dregs; after being 
well mixed, it is fit for use. 

SHRI'B. (3) Put a quart of Seville 
orange-juice to a gallon of rum, with three 



SIR

SKA 



pounds of lump sugar, and a handful of the 
peel pored extremely thin ; let it stand in the 
cask for three months, then filter it through 
a cloth, and bottle it. 

SHRUB. (4) Take a quart of orange- 
juice, strain it, put to it two pounds of lump 
sugar, four quarts and one pint of nun ; put 
half the peels of the oranges into the rum, 
ami let it stand one night, then mix the rum 
with the orange-juice and sugar, put it into 
a vessel which ha- a spirit, shake it four or 
live times daily till the sugar be all dissolved ; 
when it is clear, whirl) may lie in about a 
fortnight, Ijottle it off for use. If the or- 
anges are very ripe, a pound and a half of 
sugar is snlliciont. 

SHRUB, LEMON OR ORANGE. The 

rind of tlie lemons or oranges being grated 
off, ilicy are to be squeezed, and two |x<unds 
of finefy-pouoded loaf sugar is to be added 
to every pint of the strained juice; when the 
sugar is quite dissolved, two pints of rum 
;ne allowed to every pint of sirup; tlie whole 
is to be well mixed in a cask, and allowed 
to stand five or six weeks, and then drawn 
off. 

SHRUB, WHITE CURRANT. The 

currants are to be bruised and put into a 
Lag to drip; three-quarters of a pound of 
loaf sugar is to be dissolved in two quarts 
of juice, and a quart of rum being added, it 
is to be bottled for use. 

SUM IMIK CURRANTS, RASPBER- 
R1K.S, OR MULBERRIES. Pick the fruit 
from the stalks; squeeze the juice, and let it 
Main! ten days or a fortnight, or till the fer- 
inentali.il) ceax-s, which may lx- known liy

scum, and (Hiiir the juice gently into a fresh 
vessel; let it stand twenty-four hours, and 
again pour it off, to one pound of pounded 
loaf sugar allow thirteen ounces of the juice, 
(nit it into a preserving-pan, and when it lie- 
gins to lx>il, strain it through a jelly-ling, 
and Ixittlc it when cold. Burie pears boiled, 
in a little of the sirup, are beautiful. 

SIRUP OF ORANGE OR LEMON 

IT.r.l.. Offresh outer rind of Seville orange 
or lemon |>eel, three ounces, apothecaries' 
weight; boiling water a pint and a half ; in- 
fuse them for a night in a close vessel; then 
strain the liquor: let it stand to settle; and 
having [xmrcd it off clear from the sediment, 
dissolve in it two pounds uf donhle-refined 
k>af siii;:o , and make it into a sirup with a 
gentle he.it. 

Obs. In making this sirup, if the sugar 
be dissolved in the infusion with as gentle a 
heat as possible, to prevent tin; exhalation 
17* 



of the volatile parts of the peel, this sirup 
will possess a great share of the fine flavor 
of the orange or lemon peel. 

SIRUP, CLARIFIED. Break into bits 
two pounds (avoirdupois) of double-refined 
lump sugar, and put it into a clean stcwpan 
(that is well tinned), with a pint of cold 
spring water; when the sugar is dissolved, 
set it over a moderate fire: beat aljout half 
the white of an egg, put it to the sugar be- 
fore it gets warm, and stir it well together. 
Watch it ; and when it boils take off the 
scum ; keep it boiling till no scum rises, and 
it is perfectly clear; then run it through a 
clean napkin: put it into a close-stopped 
bottle; it will keep for months, and is an 
elegant article on the sideboard for sweet- 
ening. 

Oo*. Tle proportion of sugar ordered in 
the alxive sirup is a quarter pound more than 
that directed in the Pharmacopeia of the 
London College of Physicians. The quanti- 
ty of sugar must be as much as the liquor is 
capable of keeping dissolved when cold, or 
it will ferment, and quickly spoil: if kept in 
a teni|xTaie degree of heat, the above pro- 
portion of sugar may be considered the basis 
of all sirups. 

SKATE, FRIED. After you have 
cleaned the fish, divide it into fillets; dry 
them on a clean cloth ; Ix-at the yolk and 
white of an egg thoroughly together, dip the 
fish in this, and then in line bread-crumbs; 
fry it in hot lard or drippings till it is of a 
delicate brown color ; lay it on a hair sieve 
to drain; garnish with crisp parsley, and 
some like caper sauce, with an anchovy 
in it. 

SKATE, TO CRIMP. Skin the skate 
on both sides, cut it an inch and a half 
broad, and as long as tin- skate, roll up each 
piece and tie it with a thread ; lay them for 
three hours in salt and water, and a little 
vinegar; boil them fifteen minutes in boiling 
salt and water; Ix't'oie serving, cut off the 
threads. Sauces: shrimp, butter and an- 
chovy. When tlie skate are very small, they 
are preferable broiled. 

SKATE, LARGE, DRESSED LIKE 
VEAL CPTLETS. Crimp, or cut the skate 
in square pieces, roll them in beaten eggs, 
and then in grated bread mixed with chop- 
ped | tii .-lev . pepper, and salt ; fry tlmn of a 
nice brown color, and serve with a rich 
brown grav\ . 

SKATE, STEWED. Skin tlie skate, 
art it into square pit-res, ami l>rown it with 
l.iitter in a living-pan; make a rich sauce 
with tlie skin and parings, to be boiled in.

three pints of water, with an oninn, some 
pepper and salt; strain and thicken it with 
a little butter mixed with flour, add some 
very finely chopped parsley, and chives ; of 
hot vinegar, mushroom ketchup, and Harvey 
sauce, a table-spoonful each, and a little 
cayenne ; boil it up and put it in the skate 
five minutes before serving it. 

SKATE, Is very good when in good 
eeason, but no fish so bad when it is other- 
wise: those persons that like it firm and dry, 
should have it crimped ; but those that like 
it tender, should have it plain, and eat it 
not earlier than the second day, and if cold 
weather, three or four days old it is better: 
it cannot be kept too long, if perfectly sweet. 
Young skate eats very tine crimped and 
fried. 

SKATE, SMALL, TO FRY. Clean, 
wash, and lay them one or two hours in vin- 
egar, or vinegar and water, with a sliced 
onion, some chopped parsley, pepper, and 
salt; drain and dry them well, dip them into 
beaten eggs, dredge them with flour, and fry 
them of a fine brown color; garnish them 
with fried parsley. Sauces ; melted butter, 
and shrimp sauce. 

SKIRRETS. Wash and scrape them, 
put them on in boiling water, and boil them 
for ten minutes; dry them in a cullender, 
and fry them brown in a little butter. They 
are sometimes plain boiled, and a little mel- 
ted butter poured over them. 

SMELTS, TO FRY. This delicate lit- 
tle fish, when perfectly fresh, must not be 
washed, but wiped with a clean cloth, and 
dredged with flour, or brushed over with a 
feather, dipped into the yolk of an egg beat- 
en, and rolled in a plate of finely-grated 
bread-crumbs, and fried in boiling dripping, 
or fresh lard. They vary in size, and some 
will be done sooner than others. When of 
a clear yellow brown, take them out careful- 
ly, ;ind lay them before the fire upon the back 
of a sieve to drain and keep hot. Dish 
them, heads and tails alternately; garnish 
with fried parsley. Sauce melted butter. 
They may also te broiled. 

SMELTS, ITALIAN. Boil your smelts 
with a large glass of white wine, half a glass 
of water, two spoonfuls of oil, two slices of 
lemon, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of fennel. 
When sufficiently done, make a liaison with 
yolks of eggs, and shred chervil, and serve 
your fish with its own sauce. 

SNIPES. When the snipes have been 
picked, they must be singed over a charcoal 
fire; in tracing tliem press the legs close to 



the side, and pierce the beak through them ; 
tie a slice of baron over each bird, run a long 
iron skewer through the sides, apd tie them 
to the spit; in the meantime cut two or three 
slices of bread, according to the number of 
the birds, fry them of a tine brown color in 
butter; put the birds to must, and put the 
fried bread in a dish under them, to receive 
the inside, which will drop after they have 
hung a few minutes; just before they are 
roasted sufficiently, cut off the bacon, that 
they may take color. Serve them on the 
dish with the bread under them, and plenty 
of good gravy. Some prefer eating them 
with butter only, considering that gravy 
takes off from the fine flavor of the bird. 
They should be carved [lie same as fowls or 
pigeons, and the head should be opened, as 
some are fond of the brains. Snipes are 
generally dressed in the same manner as 
woodcocks. 

SNOW-BALLS, BOILED IN BUT- 
TER. Mix with six well-beaten eggs one 
pint and a half of sour cream, and add by 
decrees as much (lour as will make the bat- 
ter thick enough for the spoon to stand in 
it; sweeten it with brown sugar, and put 
in a few cardamons; stir into this mixture 
half a pint of beer, beat it all well to- 
gether, and drop it with a dessert-spoon 
into some boiling lard, or butter. Drain 
them upon a towel before the fire, and serve 
them in a napkin, with sugar sifted over 
them. 

SNOW CHEESE. Sweeten, with poun- 
ded loaf sugar, a quart of good cream ; add 
the strained juice of three lemons, and one 
ounce and a half of blanched sweet 
pounded, and two table-spoonfuls of rose- 
water, and one of ratafia. Beat it with a 
whisk till thick, and put it into a shape or 
sieve with a bit of muslin laid into it, ami 
in twelve hours take it out. 

SODA WATER. Tartaric acid half 
an ounce, arated soda, half an ounce. Have 
two tumblers about one-third full of water, 
put a tea-spoonful of the soda into one glass, 
and the same of the acid into the other; 
when dissolved, mix them together, and 
drink it immediately. The two sorts of salts 
must be kept in separate bottles, and should 
be bought ready powdered. 

SOLES OR OTHER FISH, TO FRY. 

An hour before you intend to dress them, 
wash them thoroughly, and wrap them in a 
clean cloth, to make them perfectly dry, or 
the bread-crumbs will not stick to them. 

Prepare some bread-crumbs, by rubbing 
some stale bread through a colander; or, 
if )ou wish the fish to appear very delicate

and highly finished, through a hair sieve; or 
ose biscuit (xiwder. 

Heat the yolk and white of an egg well 
. on a pliitf, with a fork; flour your 
li.-li. to absorb :iny moisture that may remain, 
and wipe it otV with a clean cloth ; dip them 
in tiic CLTU' "ii both sides all over, or, what 
is IM-UIT, c.'ir tin in with a |>aste-lirnsh ; put 
die egg o;i in an even degree over the whole 
fish, or tlie I ii i ad crumbs will not stick 
to it even, and tl>e uneven part will burn 
to the pan. Strew the bread crumbs all 
over tin- ti-h. so that they cover every part, 
take up the fish by the head, and shake off 
the loose crumb-. The fish u now ready 
for the fry ing-pun, into which put a quart 
or more of fre>h sweet olive oil, or clar- 
ified butter, dripping, lard, or clarified drip- 
pings; I*- sine that they are quite sweet 
and perfectly clean (the fat ought to cover 
the fish): what we lien: order is for soles 
about ten inches long; if larger, cut them 
into pieces the proper size to help at table ; 
this will save much time and trouble to the 
carver: when yon send them to table, lay 
them in It:.- - i:;ie firm they were lief.ire they 
were cut, ami you may strew a little curled 
: over them: they are much easier 

managed in the I'.-ying-pan, and require less 
fill: fiy the thick part a few minutes before 
you put in the thin, you can by this means 
only fry the thick part enough, without fry- 
ing till thin too much. Very large soles 
lilionld Ix; Ixiiled, or fried in fillets. Soles 
cut in piece?, crossways, about the size of a 
cinch, make a \eiy pretty garnish for stewed 
fish ami Ixiiled fish. 

Set the fryins-jxin over a sharp and clear 
fire; wati-h it, skim it with an egg-slice, and 
wlietl it Ijoils, t. e. when it lias done bub- 
bling, and the smoke just liegins to rise from 
"e, put in the li.-h: if (lie fat is not 
extremely hot, it la impossible to fry finh 
of a g'xld color, or to keep them firm and 
crisp. 

The liest way to ascertain the heat of tlie 
fat, is to i ry it with a bit of bread as big as 
a nut; it" it i- quite hot enough, the bread 
will brown immediately. Put in tlie fish, 
and it will lie crisp and brown on the side 
next tin- (iie. in about four or live minutes; 
to turn it, suck a two-pronged fork near the 
head, and snp|>ort the tail with a fish-slice, 
and fry the other side nearly the same length 
of time. Fry one sole ;ft a time, except the 
|xm is very large, a ,,,| \,,n have plenty of fat. 

\\ hen the tish are (Vied, lay ilwin on a wilt 
cloth (old table-cloths are best), near enough 
.the fire to keep them warm; turn tliem 
every two or three minutes, till tliey are 
quite dry on Imth sides; this common cooks 
commonly neglect. It u ill take ten or fifteen 
minutes, if the fat you fried tliem in was not 
hot enough; when it is, they want veiv little 



drying. When soles are fried, they will 
keep very good in a dry place for three or 
four days; warm tliem by hanging tliem on 
the hooks in a Dutch oven, letting them heat 
very gradually, by putting it some distance 
from the fire for about twenty minutes, or in 
good gravy, as eels, Wiggy's way. 

Obt. There are several general rules in 
this receipt which apply to all fried fish : 
we have been rery particular and minute in 
our directions; for, although a fried sole is 
io frequent and favorite a dish, it is very 
seldom brought to table in perfection. 

SOLES, TO BOIL. A fine, fresh, thick 
sole is almost as good eating as a turhot. 
Wash and clean it nicely; put it into a fish- 
kettle with a handful of salt, and as much 
cold water as will cover it ; set it on tlie side 
of the fire, take off tlie scum as it rises, and 
let it boil gently; about five minutes (accord- 
ing to its size) will be long enough, unless 
it be very large. Send it up on a fish-drain- 
er, garnished with slices of lemon and sprigs 
of curled parsley, or nicely-fried smelts, or 

oyj-ters. 

" Obs. Slices of lemon are a universally 
acceptable garnish with either fried orbroif- 
ed fish: a few sprigs of crisp parsley may IK: 
added, if yon wish to make it look very 
smart ; and parsley, or fennel and butter, are 
excellent sauces, or chervil sauce, or anchovy. 

SOLES, TO DRESS MAIGRE. Put 
the fish into a stewpan, with a large onion, 
four cloves, fifteen berries of allspice, and the 
same of black pepper ; just cover tliem with 
boiling water, set it where they will simmer 
gently for ten or twenty minutes, according 
to i he si/.c of the tish; strain off the liqnor 
in another :-tew|>an, leaving the fish to keep 
warm till the sauce is ready. Rub together 
on a plate as much flour and butter as will 
make the sauce as thick as a double cream. 
Each pint of sauce season with a .glass of 
wine, half as much mushroom ketchup, a tea- 
spoonful of essence of anchovy, and a few 
grains of cavenne; let it boil a few minutes, 
put the fish on a deep dish, strain the gravy

fltmr, and season it with pepper, salt, essence 
of anchovy, mushroom ketchup, and a little 
Chili vinegar; when it has boiled ten min- 
utes, strain it through a tamis, and pour it 
over the fish: if there is more sauce than 
i In 1 dish will hold, send the rest up in a boat. 
The river trout comes into season in April, 
and continues till July; it is a delicious fish. 

SORREL, TO STEW. Strip the leaves 
from the stalks, wash them well, scald them 
in boiling water in a silver saucepan, or in 
an earthern pipkin ; strain and stew them in

and let it boil slowly; in the meantime make 
an omelet in the u.-ual way, lay it tin a dish, 
thicken the sorrel with the yolks of two egp, 
pour it on the omelet, and serve it very hot. 

SOUFFLEJ, APPLE. Prepare apples 
as for baking in a pudding, put them into a 
deep dish, and lav upon the top, about an 
inch and a half thick, rice boiled in new 
milk with sugar; beat to, a stift" froth the 
whiles gf two or three eggs, with a little 
sifted loaf sugar, lay it upon the rice, and 
bake it in an oven a light brown. Serve it 
instantly when done. 

SOUfFLET, RICH. Soak in white 
wine and a little brandy, sweetened with su- 
gar, some slices of sponge cake ; put them 
into a deep dish, and pour over them a rich 
custard ; beat to a stiff froth the whites of 
three or four eggs, and with a table-spoon 
lay it over the top in heaps to look rough ; 
brown it in a Dutch oven, and serve quickly. 

SOUFFLET, RICE. Soak in half a 
pint of milk, for an hour, one ounce of rice, 
and the peel of a lemon cut thin; put it into 
a saucepan, with a little salt, and add by 
degrees a pint of new milk, and a bit of but- 
ter the size of a walnut; stir it till it boil, 
and for five minutes after. When cool, add 
the yolks of six eggs, beaten with two table- 
spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and stir in 
the well-l>eaten whites of the eggs, and dress 
the soufflet in the dish like a pyramid. 



Bake it in an oven. It may 1 made with 
two table-spoonfuls of potato flour, which 
mix with a little milk, and a little salt, and 
then thicken it over the fire with more milk ; 
put a little orange-flower water, or any other 
perfume; whilst in the oven it may l>e glazed 
with sifted loaf sugar. 

SOUFFLET, ORANGE. Mix with a 
table-spoonful of flour a pint of cream, put 
it into a saucepan, with two spoonfuls of 
rose-water, a little cinnamon and orange- 
peel; stir it till it boil ; strain and sweeten 
it, and when cold, mix in two table-spoon- 
fuls of orange marmalade; teat well six 
eggs with a glass of brandy; mix all togeth- 
er; put it in a buttered shape; place it in 
a saucepan of boiling water, over a stove; 
let it boil one hour and a quarter without a 
cloth or cover over it. 

SOUPS. Everv utensil employed in a 

kitchen must be kept scrupulously clean, 
and a cook ought to take especial care that 
all her saucepans be in good order. Brass 
pans are preferable for preserving in, and 
double biock tin are the best sort in use for 
every other ; .nrpose; their covers, should be 
made to lit elosi-ly, and the tinning always 
renewed as soon as it is observed to be 
wearing oil'. While new, they may be 
easily kept clean liv washing them regularly 
in hot water, and rubbing on them when 
quite dry, a little whiting with leather or 
liamu'l. After lon<: use, they will require 
occasional scouring with fine sand ; and be- 
fore they arc used, they ought always to be 
rinsed out with hot water, and wiped with 
a clean cloth. A landlady will find it good 
economy, and for her advantage in other 
respects, to provide plenty of stone ware and 
earthen vessels, and also common dishes for 
the kitchen, that the table set may not be 
used to keep cold meat on. 

In boiling soup, less water is used in a 
digester than in a common pot, as in a di- 
gester no steam can escape. 

To extract the strength from meat, long 
and slow boiling is necessary, but c::ro must 
be taken that the ]x>t is never off" the boil. 
All soups are better for being made the (lay- 
before they are to be used, and they should 
then be strained into earthen pans. When 
soup has jellied in the pan, it should not be 
removed into another, as breaking it will 
| occasion its becoming sour sooner titan it 
would otherwise do; when in danger of not 
keeping, it should be boiled up. It never 
keeps long with many vegetables in it. The 
nwat used for soups or broths cannot be too 
fresh. When any animal food is plain 
bofled, the liquor, with the addition of the 
trimmings of meat and poultry, make good 
soups and gravies, as do also die bones of

fifteen pounds of u leg or shin of beef, cut off 
the meat in bits, rub the bottom of the pot 
with butter, put in the meat, let it brown 
for nearly an hour, turning it constantly, 
break the bone and take out the marrow, 
which may be kept for a pudding, but it is 
considered better than butter to brown the 
meat with; put to it fourteen quarts of cold 
water, and the bones; when it boils, skim 
it perfectly clean, and add six good-sized 
red onions, one carrot cut in three, one 
head of celery, a good handful of whole 
black and Jamaica pepper mixed; let this 
boil very gently ten or twelve hours closely 
covered, if upon a fire, but if done upon a

or macaroni, in a little salt and water, till 
tender; strain it, and add it to the soup 
just before serving. This soup is quite 
pure, and requires no clearing. It is a 
most convenient thing to have in a house in 
cold weather, as it is always ready for use;

the weak soup they were lioiled in. Half a 
pint of wine may lie added a little before 
serving, but it is very good without. 

GOURD, Should be made of 

full-grown gourds, but not those that have 
hard skins; slice three or four, and put them 
in a stewpan, with two or three onions, and 
a good bit of butter; set them over a slow 
fire till quite tender (be careful not to Jet 
them burn) ; then add two ounces of crust of 
bread, anil two quarts of good consomme; 
season with salt and cayenne pepper: boil 
ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; skim 
off all the fat, and pass it through a tamis ; 
then make it quite hot, and serve up with 
fried bread. 



GRAVY, CLEAR. Cut half a 

pound of ham into slices, and lay them at 
the bottom of a large stewpan or stockpot, 
with two or three pounds of lean l>ccf, and 
as much veal ; break the bones, and lay them 
on the meat; take off the outer skin of two 
large onions and two turnips; wash, clean, 
and cut into pieces a couple of large carrots, 
and two heads of celery; and put in three 
cloves and a large blade of mace. Cover 
the stewpan close, and set it over a smart 
fire. When tlte meat begins to stick to the 
bottom of the stewpan, turn it; and when 
there is a nice brown glaze at the bottom of 
the stewpan, cover the meat with hot water:

table-spoonful of mmhroom ketchup. You 
will have three quarts of soup, as well color- 
ed, and almost as well flavored, as if made 
wilh gravy meat. To make tins it requires 
nearly five hours. To fry the hcilw requires 
twenty-five minutes; to toil all together, one 
hour and a hull ; to settle, at the least, two 
hum's ; when clear, and put on the fire aguHi.

then lay it in a stewpan, and cover it with 
cold water, and half a gallon over; as it be-

which must be immediately removed ; let it 
boil gently lor one hour, take it up, and when 
almost cold, cut the head into pieces about 
an inch and a half by an inch and a quarter, 
and the tongue into mouthful*, or rather 

de-dish of the tongue and brains. 
When the head is taken out, put in the

the trimmings and bones of the head, skim 
it well, and dien cover it close, and let it

ike gravy sauces) ; then strain it off, ! 
and let it stand till the next morning; then 
take off the fat, set a large stewpan on the

twelve ounces of onions sliced, and four oun- 
ces of green sage ; chop it a little; let these

flour, and by degrees add your broth till it in 
the thickness of cream ;' season it with a 
quarter of an ounce of ground allspice and 
half an ounce of black pepper ground very 
fine, salt to your taste, and the rind of one 
lemon peeled very thin; let it simmer very 
gervly fir one hour and a half, then strain it 
through a hair sieve ; do not nib your soup 
to yi il through ihe sieve, or it will make it I 
{,'ioutv ; if it docs not run through easily, ! 



knock your wooden spoon against the aide 
of your sieve; put it in a clean stewpan with 
the head, and season it by adding to each 
gallon of soup half a pint of wiiy this .should 
be Madeira, or, if you wish to duiken the 
color of your soup, claret, and two taUo- 
spoonfuls of lemon-juice ; let it simmer gently 
till the meal is tender; this may lake from 
half an hour to an hour: take care it is not 
over-done ; stir it frequently to prevent the 
meat sticking to the bottom of the Mewpun, 
and when the meat is quite tender the soup 
is ready. 

A head weighing twenty pounds, and ten 
pounds of slock meat, will make ten quarts 
of excellent soup, besides the two quarts of 
stock you have put by for made dishes. 

Obs. If thei e is more meat on the head 
than you wish to put in tlie soup, prepare it 
for a pie, and, with the addition of a calPs 
foot boiled tender, it will make an excellent 
ragout pie; season it with zest, and a little 
minced onion, put in half a tea-cupful of 
stock, cover it with puff paste, and bake it 
one hour : when the soup comes from table, 
if there is a deal of meat and no soup, put il 
into a pie-dish, season it a little, and add 
some little stock to it; then cover it with 
paste, bake it one hour, and you have a 
good mock turtle pie. 

To season it, to each gallon of soup put 
iwo table-spoonfuls of lemon-juice, same of 
mushroom ketchup, and one of essence of 
anchovy, half a pint of wine (this should be 
Madeira, or, if you wish to darken the color 
of your soup, claret), a tea-spoonful of curry 
powder, or a quarter of a drachm of cayenne, 
and the peel of a lemon pared as thin a* 
possible; lei it simmer five minutes more, 
take out the lemon-peel, and the soup is ready 
for the tureen. 

While the soup is doing, prepare for each 
tureen a dozen and a half of mock turtle 
forcemeat balls, and put them into die tureen. 
Brain balls, or cakes, are a very elegant ad- 
dition, and are made by boiling the brain* 
for ten minutes, llien pulling ihem in cold 
water, and cutting them into pieces about a* 
big as a large nutmeg ; take savory, or lemon 
thyme dried and finely powdered, nutmeg 
grated, and pepper and salt, and pound them 
all together; beat up an egg, dip the brains 
in it, and then roll them in this mixture, and 
make as much of it as possible stick to diem ; 
dip them in the egg again, and then in finely- 
grated and sifted bread-crumbs ; fry them la 
hot fat, and send them up as a side dish. 

A veal sweetbread, not too much done of 
il will break, cut into pieces the name size 
as you cut the calf's head, and put in the 
soup, just to get warm before it goes to table,

N. B. In helping this soup, the distri- ] 
l>uler of it should serve out the meat, force- 
meat, and gravy, in equal parts; however , 
trifling or needless this remark may appear, , 
the writer ha* often suffered from the want 
of such a hiut l>eing given to the soup-serr- .

gravy without meat, at others, of meat with- 
out gravy, and sometimes scarcely any thing

the reach of those who "eat to live;" but 
if it had been composed expressly for those 
who only " live to eat," I do not know how 
it could have been made more agreeable: as 
it is, the lover of good eating will " wish his

catch, take off the cover, and watch it ; and 
when it lias got a good brown color, fill up 
tlie stewpan with boiling water, and let it 
simmer very gently for two hours: if you 
wish to have the full benefit of the meat, 
only stew it till it is just tender, cut it into 
mouthfuls, and put it into the soup. To 
thicken it, pour two or three table-spoonfuls 
of flour, a ladleful of tlie gravy, and stir it

Obs. If the meat is rut off the bones, 
yon must have three tails lor a tureen, some 
put an ox-cheek or tails in an earthen 
pan, u ilh all the ingredients as above, and 
send them to a slow oven for five or six 
hours. 



PEAS, GREEN. (1) A peck of 

peas will make you a good tureen of soup. 
In shelling them, put the old ones in one 
basin, and the young ones in another, and 
keep out a pint of them, and boil them 
separately to put into your soup when it is 
finished: put a large saucepan on the fire 
half full of water; when it boils, put the 
peas in, with a handful of salt; let them 
boil till they are done enough, i. e. from 
twenty to thirty minutes, according to their 
age and size; then drain them in a colan- 
der, and put them into a clean gallon stew- 
pan, and three quarts of plain veal or mut- 
ton broth (drawn from meat without any 
spices or herbs, &c. which would overpow- 
er the flavor of the soup) ; cover the stewpun 
close, and set it over a slow fire to stew 
gently for an hour ; add a tea-cupful of bread 
crumbs, and then rub it through a tamis in- 
to another stewpan ; stir it with a wooden 
spoon, and if it is too thick, add a little 
more broth: have ready boiled as for eating, 
a pint of young peas, and put them into the 
soup ; season with a little salt and sugar. 

Some cooks, while this soup is going on, 
slice a couple of cucumbers (as you would 
for eating) ; takeout the seeds; lay them 
on a cloth to drain, and then flour them, 
and fry them a light brown in a little but- 
ter ; put them into the soup the last thing 
before it goes to table. 

If the soup is not green enough, pound a 
handful of pea-hulls or spinage, and squeeze 
the juice through a cloth into the soup: some 
leaves of mint may be added, if approved. 

PEAS, GREEN. (2) Put a 

pint of old green peas into three quarts of 
water, a slice of the crumb of bread, two 
onions, a sprig of mint, some salt and pep- 
|x.-r; Imil them till the peas are perfectly 
soft, then pulp them through a sieve; have 
ready two lettuces stewed tender in butter, 
ami a pint and a half of young green peas 
U)iled; put them into the soup with a little 
spinach juice, and a quarter of a pint of 



the juice of the youngest pea pods, and boil 
it all together lx fore serving. 

1'F.AS, GREEN, WITHOUT 

MEAT. Take a quart of green peas (keep 
out half a pint of the ynui^e>l; l,oil them 
separately, and pit them in the soup when 
it is finished); put them on in hailing \\ater; 
boil them tender, anil t!i"ii pour o:i' the wa- 
ter, and set it by t,. make the .-oiip w itl> : put 
the pens into a mortar, and pound them to 
a ma?h; tlie.i put them into two cjii;ats ( f 
the water you boiled the peas in; stir all 
well together; let it Ixiil up (or about fiu> 
minutes, and then rub it through a hair sieve 
or tiimis. If the peas are good, it will be 
as thick and fine a vegetable soup as need 
he sent tu table 

PEAS, OLD. (1) Put a pound 

and a half of split peas on in four quarts of 
water, with roast beef or mutton lx>nes, and 
a ham bone, two heads of celery, and four 
onions, let them boil till the peas be suffi- 
ciently soft to pulp through a sieve, strain it, 
put it into tiie pot with pepper and salt, and 
boil it nearly an hour. Two or three hand- 
fuls of spinach, well washed and cut a litde, 
added when (lie soup is strained, is a great 
improvement ; and in the summer young 
green peas in place of the spinach. A tea- 
spoonful of celerv seed, or essence of celery, 
if celery is not to be had. 

PEAS, OLD. (2) Boil in five 

quarts of water one quart of split peas, an 
ounce of butter, four pounds of beef, two 
carrots, three turnips, four heads of celery, 
three onions, some salt and black pepper; 
boil them till the |jeas are dissolved and 
will easily pnlp, put it all through a sieve, 
then put the soup over the lire with Uiree 
ounces of butter and a table-spoonful of flour, 
and boil a small bit of lean ham in it, till it 
is time to serve; take it out lie(or<; dishing, 
and have ready some celery stewed in butter, 
and fried bread cut in dice, and dried mint 
rubbed very fine, to send to table with it. 

PEAS, OLD. (3) Boil in four 

quarts of water a shank of ham, or a piece 
of bacon, and almut half a pound of mutton, 
or salt beef, and a pint of split peas; boil 
all together very gently till the peas are 
quite soft, strain them through a hair sieve, 
and bruise them with the back of a spoon till 
all is pulped through, then Ixiil the soup gent- 
ly for one hour belore serving. Thin slices 
of* bread toasted and cut in dice to be served 
with it, either upon a dish or in the soup; 
if in the soup, it should l>e fried in butter, 
and dried mint rublied line and sent to table 
in a small dish. It may lx: also made with 
fourpeiice worth of bones, boiled for some

and salt, strained, anil the next day the fat 
taken of]', :nnl the |x-a.s boiled in (lie liquor 
with a little hit of butter, till sufficiently ten- 
der to pulp through a sieve. 

PEAS, PLAIN. To a quart 

of split peas, and two bead:! of celery (and 
most ciiuks wmilil put a large onion), put 
three quart- of broth or soft water; Irt them 
simmer gently on a trivet over a slow fire 
for three, hum's, stirring up every quarter of 
an hour to prevent the peas burning at the 
bottom of the soii|>-kettle (if the water boils 
away, and the soup gets too thick, add some 
lx)iling water to it) ; when they are well sof- 
tened, work them through a coarse sieve, 
and then through a fine sieve or a tamis; 
wa.-h o'lt your slewpan, and then return the 
Soup into it, and give it a U.il up; take <>']' 
any s-iiin that comes up, and it is ready. 
Piv|>are fri-d bread, and dried mint, as di- 
rected in Old Peas (2) and send them up 
with it on two side dishes. 

Obs. This is an excellent family soup, 
produced with very little tumble or ex|x'iise. 

I'Kil'.ON. (1) Have a strong beef 
stock, highly seasoned, and if for rich soup, 
take six or ei^ht pigeons according to their 
si/j', wa.-h tli'-iu clean, cut off the necks, pin- 
ions, livers and gi/.y.ards, and put them into 
the stock; quarter the pigeons and brown 
them nieelv; after having strained the stock, 

put in the pig is; let them Ixiil till nearly 

readv, which will ! in about half an hour, 
then thi< l.en it with a little flour, robbed 
down in a tea-cupful of the soup, season it 
with half a "rated nuline,r. a t.iblt -s|>oiil'iil 
of lemo'i jmee or of vinegar, and one of 
mushroom ketchup; let it Ixiil a lew minutes 
after all these ingredients are put in, nnd 
serve it with the pig-ons in the tureen; a 
better thickening than Hour is to lioil quite 
tender two of the pigeon-, take off all the. 
meat and pound it in a mortar, rub it through 
a sie\r, and |xit it, with the cm 
into the -trained soup. To make partridge 
soup, partridfM mav IK- substituted for pig- 
eons, when only four birds will be n-<itiiie.| ; 
pound tlte breast of one. 

PIGEON. (2) Take eight pig. 

eons, cut down two of the oldest, anil put 
them, with the necks, pinions, li\ei.-, .ml 
gizzards of tin- oilier.*, into four quar- of 
water; let it boil till the sulistance 
teil, and strain it; .season the pigeons with 
mixed spices and salt, and truss them as for 
tewing; |iick and w>ish clean a handful of 
panley, dims or young onions, a 1 

deal of spinach ; chop them; |HII in a fivmj;- 
;> r: a ijii. uler of a pound of butler, and when 



it boils, mix in a handful of bread crumbs, 
keep stirring them with a knife till of a fine 
brown; boil the whole pigeons till they be- 
come tender in the stock with the herbs, and 
fried bread. If the soup be not sufficiently 
high seasoned, add more mixed spices and 
salt. 



PORTABLE. Put on, in four 

gallons of water, ten pounds of a shin of 
beef, free from fat and skin, six pounds of a 
knuckle of veal, and two fowls, break the 
bones and cut the meat into small pieces, 
seaoii with one ounce of whole black pep- 
per, quarter of an ounce of Jamaica pepper, 
and tlie same of mace, cover the pot very 
closely, and let it simmer for twelve or four- 
ted, hours, and then strain it. The follow- 
ing day, take off the fat, and clear the jelly 
from any sediment adhering to it; boil it 
gently U|x>n a stove, without covering the 
saucepan, and stir it frequently till it be- 
<->!!,,> very thick and in lumps about the pan. 
Put it into saucers alxmt half full, and when 
cold lay the cakes ii|xin llannel to dr\ Ix-lore 
the tire or in the sun ; keep them in a tin 
lx>x, with white pajx.T between each cake. 
About an ounce weight will make a pint of 
rich soup; pour boiling water ii|X)ii it with 
a little salt, and stir it till it dissolves. It 
also answers well for gravies and all brown 
sauces. 



FOR THE POOR. Wash an 

ox-head very clean ; break the bones, and 
cut the meat in pieces; put it on in thirteen 
gallons of water, and a peck and a half of 
potatoes, half a peck of turnips, the same 
quantity of on ions, and some carrots; peel and 
cut them all down. A handful of pot herbe, 
and two quarts of oatmeal ; season with 
pepper ami salt. Cover the pot closely, and 
let it stew till the next morning; add as 
i. inch hot water as ma\ ha\e wasted inboil* 
inn, and let it stew for some hours longer, 
w hen it will be fit for use. This soup will 
be found very good for a family dinner. 

QUEEX. Pound in a marblft 

mortar the white meat of three cold roasted 
low N, and half a pound of sweet almonds 
blanched ; add a little cream whilst pound- 
ing. Boil this with tour quarts of well-sea* 
-oni-il beef stock, then strain it, and just 
before serving stir in a pint of cream. 

SANTE. (1) Peel four larga 

onions, cut them -mall, with lour white let- 
tuces, a handful of spinach, and a slice of 
grated bread. Stew all these ingredient* 
lor an hour in .1 quart of broth ami a quarter

I more of broth, nkirn off all the fat, and boil 
I it a quarter of an hour, season ilh pepper

SOUPS 



and salt. Before serving, add half a pint 
of good cream. A pint of green |>eas, ad- 
ded will) the other vegetables, is a great im- 
provement. 



SANTE. (2) Lay six or eight 

slices of lean ham, with some beef over them, 
at the bottom of a stewpan, then some veal, 
with some partridge-legs, or moor game, or 
chicken, salt, peppercorns, Jamaica pepper, 
three or four cloves, a bay-leaf, and one 
clove of garlic: let the whole stew together 
till it takes a fine brown color, then fill it up 
with half water, and half good beef stock; 
add three heads of celery, two good turnips, 
parsley, lemon thyme, two carrots, three 
large onions, and a small bunch of winter 
savory; whoa the whole is thoroughly well 
done, pass it through a lawn sieve into a ba- 
sin. Cut two good-sized turnips and three j 
large leeks, into pieces, about the thickness 
of a cjuill, and an inch and a half long; fry 
these together of a nice brown color: next, 
shred two cabbage-lettuces, celery, endive, 
sorrel, and chervil ; and stew them down on 
a very slow fire with a small bit of butter. 
When done, put them in a sieve with the 
turnips; then put them into a soup-pot, and 
pour the son)) from the basin over them; set j 
it on a stove, skim it, and as soon as it boils, 
set it on one side, and let it simmer for two 
hours very gently; take the cmmb of a 
couple of French rolls, and cut it into round 
pieces, which brown in the oven, and put 
them into the tureen, and pour the soup upon 
them. If you think proper, it may be clari- 
fied, the same as other clear soups; but the 
ixr.il Soup de Sanfcoi'ght not to be clarified. 

SIMPLE. Cut small one pound 

of carrots, one pound of turnips, half a 
pound of onions, one lettuce, a little celery, 
and a handful of parsley; stew them for 
twenty minutes with a quarter of a pound 
of butter, some salt ami pepper; then put 
them into three quarts of stock, made with 
two pounds of veal, and add one quart of 
green peas, and let it stew for three hours. 
Press it through a sieve, and boil it up before 
sending it to table. 

SPRING. Put on in four quarts 

of water a knuckle of veal cut down, and a 
quarter of a pound of lean ham, or a gam- 
mon of bacon; a quart of green split peas; 
cut small three or four onions, three turnips, 
a little parsley, thyme, celery, and one leek ; 
stew them all together till the jieas are very 
soft ; Like out the meat and press the re- 
mainder through a fine sieve; season the 
soup with pepper and salt. Cut small like 
peas a bunch of the tops of asparagus, the 
licarts of two or three cabbage*, cutting off 
the top part and the outside leaves, and a 



little green mint, stew them till tender, 
keeping them of a good green, and add them 
to the soup a quarter of an hour before serv- 
ing. If it should not be green enough, 
pound some spinach, squeeze the juice 
through a cloth, put about a quarter of a 
pint into the tureen, and pour in the soup. 
This is the best method to make green peas 
soup of a good color. 

STOVE OR SPINACH. Boil 

in two quarts of water three sliced onions. 
Pick and clean as much spinach as will 
make two large dishes, parboil and put it in 
a cullender, to let the bitter water drip from 
it ; let cold water run upon it for a minute 
or two, and then press out the water. Knead 
two ounces of fresh butter, wilh a table- 
spoonful and a half of flour, mix it with the 
spinach, which boil for fifteen minutes in the 
water and onions, then put in half a pint of 
cream or good milk, some salt and pepper, 
boil it for fifteen minutes more. In the 
season of green pens, a quart added with 
the spinach is a great improvement. It is 
common to boil a lamb's head and pluck 
with tin; *'x'\i, and send them to table in the 
tureen. The soup is then called Lamb's 
.Stove; but wilh the peas it is quite as good 
without. 



VEGETABLE. Pare and cut 

small one dozen of common-sized onions, 
five large yellow turnips, two heads of celery, 
and the red part of three large carrots ; wash 
and put them in a stewpan with two ounces 
of butler, cover it closely; and when the 
vegetables are a little soft, add to them four 
quarts of well-seasoned gravy soup ma.-ie of 
roast beef bones, and let it slew four or five 
hours; rub it through a tammy, put it on the 
fire, boil and skim it before serving. 

WINTER VEGETABLE. (1) 

Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, 
and four turnips ; fry them in half a pound of 
butter or very fresh dripping; toast a crust 
of bread brown and hard, put it, with two or 
three heads of celery cut small, some herbs, 
pepper, and salt, with the frhd vc<;ei:ible>-, 
into five pints of water, to stew jiivitiy fa- 
four hours, then strain it through a sieve, 
add a little carrot and celery cut small, and 
some chopped jwrsley, one anchovy or a red 
hen-ing, and a little cayenne; boil it till the 
vegetables are tender.

SOUR KROUT. The best cabbage for 
this purpose is the drum, or while Stras- 
burgli, and it should not be used till it has 
endured some severe frost ; the stocks are 
then cut into halves, and shred down as fine 
as possible with a knife, or more properly 
with a plane maiie in the fi inn of a cucumber 
slice. Hum :i little juniper in a cask or tub 
which is perfectly sound and clean, and put 
a little leaven into the seam round the bot- 
tom, flour and vinegar may lie substituted 
for ftie leaven; then put in three or four 
bandittis of cabbage, a good sprinkling of 
salt, and a tea -spoonful of caraway seed, and 
press (his hard with a wooden mallet; next 
add another layer of cabbage, with salt and 
caraway seed, as at first; and soon in the 
same manner until the cask be full, pressing 
down each layer (irmly as, you advance. A 
good deal of water will come to the top, of 
which a part may be taken off. The cask 
being full, put on the head so as to press 
ujion the cabbage, and place it in a warm 
cellar to ferment; when it has worked well 
for three weeks, take off' the scum which 
will have gathered on the top, and lay a 
clean cloth on the krout ; replace the head, 
and put Iwo or three heavy stones upon it. 
The juice should always Maud upon the top. 
Thus in a good cellar it will keep for years. 
When to l>e dressed, it is boiled for five or 
six hours in water, or stewed with a little 
gravy, and may lx also substituted for a 
crust over a l>eef-steak pie, when cheese is 
grated over it. 

SOUR KROUT WITH PIKE. When 
the krout is boiled, clean a large pike, 
scrape and cut it into neat pieces, dip them 
into the beaten yolk of an egg, then into 
bread crumbs, and fry them of a nice brown ; 
rub some butter upon a dish, and put into 
it a layer of krout, and some grated cheese, 
then a layer of pike, and a little sour cream ; 
then krout, and so on till the dish be full. 
On the top put some bits of butter, and 
some good broth or gravy; strew crumbs 
of bread thickly over it, and bake it half 
an hour. 

SPANISH PUFFS. Put into a sauce- 
pan, half a pint of water and a quarter of 
a pound of butter; stir it till it boils, and 
mix in four table-spoonfuls of Hour; stir it 
well together, and add six yolks and four 
whiles of eggs, two at a time; let it cool, 
and, with a dessert-spoon, drop it into (wil- 
ing clarified dripping or lard. 

To make ginger puffs, a tea-spoonful of 
pounded ginger may be added. 



SPARE RIB ROASTED. Set Pork. 

SPICE FOR WHITE SAUCE. Pound 

two ounces of pepper, a quarter of an ounce 
of mace, grate one nutmeg, and the peel of 
one lemon; mix all together in a bottle. 

SPICE FOR GENERAL USE. One 

ounce and a half of pepper, cinnamon, nut- 
meg, and ginger, half an ounce each, and 
eight cloves; pound and mix all together in 
a bottle. A little of each kind of spice 
should be well dried, pounded, and kept 
separately in small bottles, which should be 
labelled. 

SPINACH, TO DRESS. Pick the 
spinach with great care; strip the leaves 
from the stalks, and wash it in several wa- 
ters, till perfectly clean ; boil the spinach in 
salt and water; drain it well; pound it in 
a mortar, and put it into a slewpan with a 
little butter and broth, and let it stew over 
a slow fire for three-quarters of an hour, till 
it be very dry ; then add a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter, with salt and grated 
nutmeg; work the spinach well, till it is 
thick, but take care the butler does not 
turn to oil. Garnish with fried toasU of 
bread, which may lie cut like cock's combs, 
or in any other form. 

SPINACH, TO BOIL. (1) Pick it very 
carefully, and wash it thoroughly two or 
three times in plenty of cold water, then put 
it on in boiling water with a little salt; let 
it boil nearly twenty minutes, put it into a 
cullender, hold it under the water cock, and 
let the water run on it for a minute ; put it 
into a saucepan, beat it perfectly smooth 
with a beater or with a wooden spoon, add 
a bit of butter, and three table-spoonfuls of 
cream; mix it well together, and make it 
hot liefore sen-ing. When dished, it is 
scored in squares with the back of a knife. 

SPINACH, TO BOIL. (2) After 
being nicely picked and well washed, put it 
into a saucepan, with no more water than 
adheres to it; add a little salt; cover the 
pan closely, and boil it till tender, frequent- 
ly shaking it; beat it quite smooth, adding 
butter and cream, and make it quite hot. 
Spinach may be served with poaclied eggs, 
or fried sausages laid on it. 

When the spinach is bitter, it is prefera- 
ble to boil it in water. 

SPINACH TOASTS. Boil some spi- 
nach for a quarter of an hour ; then squeeze 
out all the water, chop it small, and put it 
into a mortar, with three or four spoonfuls 
of apple marmalade, the yolks of four hard- 
boiled, and three raw eggs, two biscuits

oaked in cream, sugar, and a pinch of salt; 
pound all these together to a paste, put it 
into a dish, an I mix with it a few dry cur- 
rant;", and three or four spoonfuls of melted 
butter. Cut some slices of bread half an 
inch thirk, four indies long, and two broad; 
toast them nicely, and spread the spinach, 
&c. over them, to the tliickiifss of half an 
inch, wash each over with white of egg; 
place the toasts on a baking-tin (well butter- 
ed) and bake them for half an hour. \Vhun 
done, grate nutmeg, and squeeze orange-juice 
over theni, and serve. 

SPRATS, TO BAKE. Clean them; 
take off the heads; put them into a deep 
dish, and oner them with vine-jar and wa- 
ter, equal quantities of each. To a quart of 
liquid, pit half an ounce of whole black pep- 
per, a litileallspire, two or three bay-leaves, 
Borne salt, and an onion. Tie paper over 
the dish, and bake them in a cool oven, or 
do them over a slow lire in a water bath. 
Hermits may IK; done in this way. Both 
will keep good some weeks. 

SPRATS, STEWED. Wash and dry 
your sprats, and lay them as level as you 
can in a Mcwpan, and ln-twcen every layer 
of sprats put three peppercorns, and as many 
allspice, with a few grains of salt; barely 
cover them with vinegar, and stew them one 
hour over a slow fire; they must not boil: 
a bay-leaf is sometimes added. Herrings or 
mackerel may be stewed the same way. 

SPRATS, BROILED. If you have not 
a sprat gridiron, gel a pi<.-ce of pointed iron 
wire as thick as packthread, and as long as 
your gridiron is broad; run this through the 
heads of your sprats, sprinkle a little flour 
and silt over them, put your gridiron over a 
clear, quick lire, turn them in about a couple 
of minutes; when the other side is brown, 
draw out tlie wire, nnd send up the fi.-h v\ ith 
melted butter in a cup. 

Obs. That sprats are young herrings, is 
evident by tlwir anatomy, in which there is 
no perceptible difference. They ap[jear very 
soon after the lien ins are gone, and seem 
to be the spawn jn>t vivified.

of good thick cream; serve up in glasses, or 
in a deep dish. If wanted in a ,-liape, dis- 
MiUe two ounces of isinglass in a little water; 
strain it through a tamis, and when nearly 
cold put it to tlie cream ; pour it into a jelly 
mould, and when set, turn out into a dish, 
and serve up plain. 

SPRING FRUIT SHERBET. Boil 

six or eight sticks of rhubarb (quite clean) 
ten minutes in a quart of water; strain the 
liquor through a tamis into a jug,, with the 
peel of a lemon cut very thin, and two table- 
spoonfuls of clarified sugar; let it stand five 
or six hours, and it is fit to drink. 

SPRUCE BEER. See Beer. 

SPROUTS AND YOUNG GREENS. 

The receipt for cabbages will answer as well 
for sprouts, only they will be boiled enough 
in fifteen or twenty minutes. 

STEAKS OR CHOPS. See Chopt. 

STOCK, FOR BROWN OR WHITE 
SOUPS. Take a pound of scale, five floun- 
ders, and two pounds of eels ; cul them in 
pieces, pul them into a stewpan, with aa 
much water as will cover them, a little mace, 
an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, 
two parsley roots sliced, some pepper and 
salt, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover 
close ; strain it off for use ; if it is for brown 
soup, fry the fish brown iu butter, and then 
put it to stew. 

STOCK, FOR GRAVY SOUP OR 
GRAVY. Cut a knuckle of veal into sli- 
ces, slice also a pound of lean beef, and a 
pound of the lean of gammon of bacon ; pt 
these into a stewpan, with three scraped 
carrots, a couple of onions, a couple of tur- 
nips, two licads of celery, and two quart* 
of water. Let the meat stew till quite ten- 
der, but it must not lie brown. When thus 
prepared it will serve eillicr for soup, or 
brown or white gravy ; if for brown gravy, 
it must be first colored in the usual manner. 

STOMACHIC TINCTURE. Peruvian 
bark, bruised, one ounce and a half, orange- 
peel, do. one ounce, brandy, or proof spirit,

a wine-glass of water, twice a day, when 
you feel languid, i. e. when the stomach is 
empty, about an hour before dinner, and in 
the evening. This agreeable aromatic tonic 
is an effective help to concoction ; and we 
are under personal obligations to it, for fre- 
quently restoring our stomach to good tern- j 
per, and procuring us good appetite and good j 
digestion. In low nervous affections arising 
from a languid circulation, and when the j 
stomach is in a state of debility from age, j 
intemperance, or other causes, this is a most 
acceptable restorative. 

N. B. Tea made with dried and braised 
orange-peel, in the same way as common 
tea, and drank with milk and sugar, has 
been taken by nervous and dyspeptic per- 
sons with great benefit. Sucking a bit of 
dried orange-peel about an hour l>efore din- 
ner, when the stomach is empty, is very 
grateful and strengthening to it. 

STRAWBERRY CREAM. Put six 
ounces of straw tarry jam to a pint of cream, 
pulp it through a sieve; add to it the juice 
of a lemon, whisk it fast at the edge of a 
dish, lay the froth on a sieve, add a little 
more juice of lemon, and when no more froth 
will rise, put the cream into a dish, or into 
glasses; and place the froth upon it, well 
drained. 

STRAWBERRIES AND RASPBER- 
RIES. From either of these fruits agree- 
able wine may be obtained, by following the 
rules given for making currant wine; but it 
will be found a cheaper and a better meth- 
od, to add a little sirup or juice of the fruit 
to any flavorless currant wine; when the 
fermentation begins to decline, currant wine 
may also be flavored with odoriferous flow- 
ers, such aa cowslip, elder, or mignionette. 
The quality of roughness is communicated 
by catechu and keno, chips of oak and of 
beech, and also the sloe; a small quantity 
of these, or of the flowers, is put into the 
cask when the first fermentation is over, and 
as soon a? the wine has acquired the desired 
flavor, it is racked and fined. The flavor- 
ing articles, such as orris-root, cloves, gin- 
ger, sweet and bitter almonds, are put into 
a muslin l>ag, and hung in the cask for a 
few days, during the stage of insensible fer- 
mentation, that is, after the first fermentation 
has ceased; care being taken to tuste the 
liquor frequently, so that the flavoring mat- 
ter may be withdrawn as soon as it has pro- 
duced the desired effect. 

STRAWBERRIES, POUNDED, FOR 
STRAWBERRY CREAM. Take equal 
weight of sugar and of strawberries ; pound 
and sift the sugar, add it to the stra \vU-rries, 
and pound them in a marble mortar till per- 



fectly smooth. Put it into jars, and tie 
them over closely with paper. It will keep 
good for several months. 

STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE. Take 

a basket of very fine strawl>erries, pick, and 
crush them, and then rub them through a 
sieve. Whisk the whites of eighteen eggs 
to a firm froth, to which add a pound and a 
half of powder sugar, stir them together as 
lightly as possible ; then mix them with the 
strawberries. I'our the whole into a crotu- 
tade, and bake it for an hour in a moderate 
oven ; when done, glaze it, and serve. 

STRAWBERRY TART. Pick, and 
put into a basin two quarts of the best scar- 
let strawberries, then add to them half a 
pint of cold thick clarified sugar, and half 
a pint of Madeira, with the juice of two or 
three lemons; mix these \\i-ll together, with- 
out breaking the strawberries, and put them 
into a puff paste, previously baked; lie care- 
ful to keep them very cool. 

STRING BEANS. See French Beans. 

STUFFING WITHOUT MEAT. Sea- 
son a quarter of a pound of finely-minced 
beef suet, and an equal quantity of grated 
bread, with grated nutmeg, lemon-peer, lem- 
on thyme, and parsley, salt, and pepper; 
mix it well together, and bind it with a 
weft-beaten yolk of an e%, when it may be 
used for stuffing veal and fowl. 

STUFFING FOR TURKEY OR 
FOWL. Wash a quart of oysters in their 
own liquor, strain it, and put into it the 
oysters, with a little mace, whole pepper, 
and lemon-peel; when parboiled, chop small 
a dozen and a half, add an equal weight of 
grated bread, twice the quantity of finelv- 
minced beef suet, the yolks of three hard- 
boiled eggs, one anchovy, a little salt, ]>e|>- 
|>er, nutmeg, lemon-peel, and some minced 
parsley; bind it will) the beaten yolks of 
two eggs. For tire sauce, lxil with the 
liquor of the oysters, a pint of white stock, 
half a pint of white wine, one am-hovy, 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg; strain it, and 
add a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in 
flour, beat it up with the remainder of the 
oysters. 

STUFFING FOR A HARE. Parboil 
the liver, and mince it; add an equal quan- 
tity of grated bread, double the quantity of 
fat bacon chopped, a bit of butter the size 
of a walnut. Season with pepper, salt, nut- 
meg, chopped lemon thyme, and parsley; 
bind with an egg beaten.

of dressing this, is to have it cut in thin 

slices like veal cutlets, and broiled, and rob- 
bed over with a bit of iMitter ami a little 
|X'p|jer, and served very hot, and eaten with 
a squeeze of lemon-juice, (ii cat care, how- 
ever, must be taken to cut off the skin be- 
fore it is broiled, as the oil in the skin, if 
burned, imparts a disgusting flavor to the 
fish. The tlesh is very fine, and comets 
nearer to veal, perhaps, than even turtle. 
Siurgeon is frequently plentiful and reason- 
j able in the London shops. We prefer this 
mode of dressing it to llie more savory one 
of .-teiviujf it in rich gravy, like caip, he. 
which overpowers the peculiar flavor of the 
fish. 

STURGEON, ROASTED. Take a 

large piece of sturgeon, or a whole small 
one. clean and skin it projierly; lard it with 
eel and anchovies, and marinade, it in a 
white wine marinade. Fasten it to the 
spit, ami roast it, basting frequently with 
the marinade strained. 1/et the fish be a 
nice color, and serve with a jiepper sauce. 

BUI T TO KEEP FOR A TWELVE-

candy high; in order to ascertain which, 
drop a little from a spoon into a small jar

it is then sufficiently done; or dip (he thevil 
into the sugar, plunge it into cold water, 
draw off the sugar which adheres to the 
stick, and if it be hard and snaps, the fruit 
to be preserved must be instantly put in and 
boiled. 



SUGAR ORNAMENTS.

See Car- 



SUGAR RUFFS. A pound of pounded 
and sifted loaf sugar beaten well with the 
whites of three eggs, and flavored with oil 
of cinnamon, lemons, or orange-flower wa- 
ter, and baked in the same way as the 
meringues, served in a napkin, or used to 
garnish dishes of preserves. 

SUGAR, TO BOIL. To even pound 
of sugar allow half a pint of water; stir it 
over the fire till the sugar be entirely dissolv- 
ed; when it first boils up, pour in a little 
cold water, and when it boils a second lime, 
take it off the fire; let it settle ten minutes, 
carefully scum it, and boil it for half an hour 
or a little longer, and then put in the fruit. 

SWEETBREADS, ITALIAN ATTE- 
LETS. Blanch some nice sweetbreads, and 
stew them in a well-seasoned gravy, made 
of meat, and vegetables; when cold, cut 
them into pieces of nearly an inch square, 
put them into a sauce d'atteleU, and let 
them cool. With silver skewers, skewer 
the sweetbreads, and a bit of ready-dressed 
calf's udder alternately ; make them all as 
much as possible of an equal size, and of a 
square form. Moisten them with the sauce, 
and cover them with grated bread, then 
dip them into four well beaten eggs, strew 
over them some more grated bread, and 
level it with a knife; fry them of a fine 
brown, and serve with an Italian sauce, 
white or brown. 

If the attelets are ready before they are 
required to be fried, strew grated bread 
over the cover of a stewpan, and lay them 
upon it. 

SWEETBREAD, TO BOIL. Parboil 
it, rub it with butter, and broil it over a 
slow fire, turn it frequently, and baste it 
now and then, by putting it upon a plate 
kept warm by the fire with butter in it. 



SWEETBREADS A LA DACPHISK. 

If for a round dish, take four large and fine 
sweetbreads. If for a long dish, three will 
suffice. Pure off the fat and sinews, and 
blanch them in warm water, parboil them, 
and when cold, lard them. Rub a stew- 
I'an with fresh butter, and put into it a few 
sliced carrots and onions, then a layer of 
slices of fat bacon, place the sweetbreads 
upon the bacon, sprinkle a little salt over 
them, and stew them u ill) a great deal of 
fire on the top, and a very slow one be- 
neath ; when thev are nicely browned, cover 
them with a piece of buttered paper, cut 
round, and lessen the fire upon the top. 
They will require to stew for three-quarters 
of an hour, then drain and put them into a 
pan with some glaze, and the bacon under- 
neath. Leave them in the glaze till dinner 
time. 

SWEETBREADS FULL DRESSED. 

Parboil them, and let them get cold; then 
cut them in pieces, about three-quarters of an 
inch thic-k ; dip them in the yolk of an egg, 
then in fine bread crumbs (some add spice, 
lemon-peel, and sweet herbs) ; put some 
clean dripping into a fi vintj-pan: when it 
boils, put in the sweetbreads, and fry them 
a fine brown. For garnish, crisp parsley 
and for sauce, mushroom ketchup and melted 
butter, or anchovy sauce, or bacon or ham. 

SWEETBREADS, SMALL CASES 

OF SCOLLOPS OF. Blanch and parboil 
Mime sweetbreads, cut them into small scol-' 
! -. Then chop separately, and finely, half 
a pint of mushrooms, a little parsley, and 
four or five shallots, add a little fat bacon 
rasped, and a piece of fresh butter; season 
the scollops with pepper, salt, and a little 
marc, strw it all together over a slow fire; 
when done, drain off the fat, place the scol- 
lops in small paper cases, which have been 
fried in olive oil, cover them with plenty of 
finely-chopped herbs, and strew over them 
fried bread crumbs; lay the paper cases for 
a moment into the oven, and before serving, 
pour into each a little rich gravy, and a little 
lemon-juice. 

SWEET HERBS. See Herbs. 

SWEETMEAT FRITTERS. Cut 

small any sort of candied fruit, and heat it 
with a bit of fresh butter, some good milk, 
and a little grated lemon-peel ; when quite 
hot, stir in enough of flour to make it into a 
stiff paste, take it off the fire, and work in 
eight, or ten eggs, two at a time; when 
cold, form the fritters, and fry, and serve 
them with pounded loaf sugar strewed over 
them.

SYLLABUBS. Take the juice of a 
large lemon, the peel (pared very tliin), a 
glass of brandy, two of white wine, and a 
quarter of a pound of pdwdtr-eugar; put 
these ingredients into a pan, and lease them ; 
the next day, add a pint of thick cream, and 
the whites of two eggs; whip the whole 
well, and pour the syllabub into glasses. 
They arc the better for keeping a day or 
two. If the syllabubs are not wanted quite 
so good as the above, raisin or mountain 
wine will do as well as brandy. 

SYLLABUB, SOMERSETSHIRE. Put 
a pint of Port, and a pint of Sherry, or 
any other white wine, into a large bowl, 
sweeten it according to taste ; milk die bowl 
full; in about twenty minutes' time, cover 
it tolerably high with clouted cream; grate 
nutmeg over it ; add pounded cinnamon, and 
nonpareils. 

SYLLABUB, STAFFORDSHIRE. Put

layers, tlie largest about seven inches in 
. the rest, each somewhat smaller 
than the other ; wlien all are cut, place them 
on white pa[>er on tins, and bake them in a 
moderate oven to a clear brown, then take 
them out, and let them cool. As soon a* 
cold, place the largest piece on a China 
di.-h, ol'a sufficient size to let it lay tlat, and 
spread over it equally some preserved fruit; 
cover this with the second sized layer, on 
which also spread preserved fruit; then a 
third layer, and .-> on until all the paste is 
uned, taking care to put each layer in its

candied lemon, ;md orange-peel into the 
form of leaves, which arrange in garlands 
round the tart, putting here and there a 
small preserved fruit; when done, replace it 
in the oven for two or three minutes lo dr,, 
and then serve. 

TARTLETS. (1) Butter some small 
tartlet pans; line them with a nice thin 
puff pas'.i', mark it neatly round the edges, 
bake them ; when they are cold, fill them 
with custard, preserve, or a:iy sweetmeat 
you think proper, and if you choose, pour 
custard over. 

TARTLETS. (2) Roll out the paste 
about a quarter of an inch thick, and lay 
upon it the top part of the patty-pan ; cut it 
round witli the paste cutter. Rub die patty- 
pans with a little butter, and line them with 
the paste, and place in the middle a little bit of 
bread, which take out when they arc baked. 
They may be filled with any preserved fruit, 
and a star or leaf of paste placed on the top. 
To make ornaments of paste, roll it quite 
thin, and as even as possible; cut it with 
tin atars, leaves, or any other form, and 
bake them a light brown color, upon flat 
tins dusted with flour. 

TART, APPLE, CREAMED. Use 

green codlings, in preference to any other 
apple, and proceed as in the last receipt. 
When the pie is done, cut out the whole of 
the centre, leaving the edges; when cold, 
pour on the apple some rich boiled custard, 
and place round it some small leaves of puff 
paste of a light color. 

TART, CHERRY. The cherries may 
be stoned, and a few red currants added; 
sweeten with loaf or brow-n sugar, and put

berries, pick and wash them in several wa- 
ters, put them into a dish, with the juice of 
half a lemon, a quarter of a pound of moist 
or pounded loaf sugar, to a quart of cran- 
berries. Cover it with puff or tart paste 
and bake it three-quarters of an hour ; if 
tart paste is used, draw it from the oven 
five minutes before it is done, and ice it, re- 
turn it to the oven, and send it to table 
cold. 

TART, CURRANT. To a quart of 
red currants add one pint of red raspber- 
ries, strawberries, or cherries ; sweeten them 
well with brown sugar; l>efure putting in

ly allowed to a quart of fruit. 

TART OF PRESERVED FRUIT. 

Cover a flat dish, or tourte pan, with tart 
paste, about an eighth of an inch thick; roll 
out puff paste, half an inch thick, and cut it 
out in strips an inch wide; wet the tart 
paste, and lay it neatly round the pan by 
way of a rim ; fill the centre with jam or 
marmalade of any kind, ornament it with 
small leaves of puff paste, bake it half an 
hour, and send it to table cold. 

The al>ove may be filled before the puff 
paste is laid on, neatly strung with paste, 
and the liui (nit over after. 

Tlie most general way of sending tourtes 
to table, is with a croquante of paste, or a 
caramel of spun sugar put over after it is 
baked. 

TARTS, PRESERVED FRUIT. Rub 

over with a little butter an oval dish, or tin 
shape, line it with (Kiste, and fill it w ith any 
sort of preserved fruit. Roll out a bit of

into narrow strips; brush with water the 
rim of the shape, and lay the bars of paste 
across and across, and then put round a 
border of paste, and mark it with the paste 
cutter. 

TARTS, RIPE FRUIT. Gooseberries, 

damsons, morello cherries, currants mixed 
with raspberries, plums, green gages, white 
plums, &c. should be quite fresh picked, and 
washed: lay them in the dish with the centre 
highest, and about a quarter of a pound of 
moist or loaf sugar pounded to a quart of 
fruit (but if quite ri|>e they will not require 
sn much); add a little water; rub the edges 
of the dish with yolk of egsj; cover it with 
tart paste, about half an inch thick ; press 
\otir thumb round the rim, and close it well; 
pare it round with a knife; make a hole in 
the sides below the rim; bake it in a mode- 
raie-heated oven ; and ten minutes before it 
is done, take it out and ice it, and return it 
to tiie oven to dry. 

TART, RHUBARB. Strip off the peel,

TMK 'HI-AINU. Clarified butter is beat 
lor this purpose; but if you have none ready, 
put s.mie fresh butter into a ftewpan over a

railed roux. Be particularly attentive in 
making it; if it yets any burnt smell or 
taste, it H ill spoil every thing it is (nit into. 
When cold, it should be thick enough to cut 
out with a knife, like a solid paste. 

It is a very essential article in the kitchen, 
and is the Uisis of consistency in most made- 
('i-li'-, soii|Ki, sauces, and ragouts; if the 
^r, nil's, kc. are too thin, add this thicken- 
ing, more or less, according to the consistence 
yon would wish them to have. 

-In making thickening, the lew

gether, and the broth, or soup, cc. you put 
them t ,, addeil by degrees: take especial

a disgusting, jiivasy appearance: therefore, 
after sou have thickened \onr sauce, add to 
it some broth, or warm waits-, in ihe pro-

set it by the side of ihe tin-, to raise any fat, 
Sic. that i.- noi thoroughly incorporated with 
the gravy, which you mu-t carefully reiiKive 
as it come* to the top. This u called 
cleansing, or finishing the sauce. 

1 lalf an ounce of butler, and a table-spoon- 
ful of (lour, are about the proportion for a 
pint oi r-.mee to make it as think as cream.

o 1 the broth-pot are sometimes substituted 
for butler; some cooks merely thicken their 
sotips and sauces with Hour.

plain round moulds, with this paste; let the 
moulds lie well buttered, and the paste come 
about half an inch above the top of the mould ; 
fill your timbale with any farce, or ragout, 
you think proper, cover it with a layer of

tem|K>re, or in gravies, &c. or to flavor and 
preserve potted meats. 

TIPSY CAKE. Pour over a sponge

TONGUE. (1) " A tongue which has 
not been dried will require very little soak- 
ing, but if dried, it should lie soaked in 
water for three or four hours; then put it 
into cold water, and let it boil gently till 
tender. 

TONGUE. (2) A tongue is so hard, 
whether prewired by drying or pickliii',', that 
it requires much more cooking than a ham; 
nothing of its weight takes so long to dress 
it properly. 

A tongue that has lxn salted and dric-d 
should IK; put to soak (if it is old :md very 
hard, 24 hours More it is wanted) in plen- 
ty of water; a urien one fresh from the pic- 
kle reqniies M liking only a few hours: put 
your tongue into plenty of cold water; let 
it be an hour gradually warming; and give 
it from three und -a half to four hours' very 
slow simmering, according to the size, &c. 

Obs. When you choose a tongue, en- 
deavor to learn how long it has been dried 
or pickled, pick out the plumpest, and that 
which has the smoothest skin, which de- 
notes its Ix'ing young and tender. 

The roots, &c. make an excellent relish 
potted, or peas soup. 

TONGUE, TO STEW. Wash it very 
clean, and rub it well with common salt and 
a little salt|X'fre; let it lie tuo or three days, 
and then boil it till the skin will pull off. 
Put it into a saucepan, with part of the li- 
qnor it has l-en Boiled in, and a pint of 
good stock. Season with black and Ja- 
maica pep|>er, and two or three pounded 
i Id a glass of white wine ami a 
(abl.'-s|>oonfnl of mushroom ketchup, and 
one of lemon pickle; thicken the sauce with 
butter rolled in Hour, and pour it over the 
tongue. 

TONGUE, PICKLED, GLAXI'P. 

Boil a large tongue till it be ten.: 
and gla/e it. an. I serve, it with mashed tur- 
nips on one side, and mashed carrots, or 
carrots and spinach on the other.

an ounce of saltpetre; turn them daily, and 
in a fortnight they may IK; used. 

The. IK-SI sort of vessel for salting them 
in is an earthen- ware pan, as wide at top 
as bottom, so that the tongues may lie in it 
long-ways. 

TRIFLE. (1) Add to a pint of rich 
cream a tea-cupful of white wine, sweeten it 
with pounded loaf sugar, whisk it well, and 
as the froth rises lay it n|x>n a sieve placed

cream into the pan in which it is whisked 
till all is done ; dip some sponge biscuit, rata- 
fia cakes, or Savoy biscuit, into sweet wine 
and a little brandy; pour over them a lich 
boiled custard, and when quite cold, lay on 
the whipt cream, piled as high as possible. 
Colored comfits may be strewed over the 
top. 

TRIFLE. (2) Mix three table-spoon- 
fuls of white wine, and one of sugar, with a 
pint and a half of thick cream; whisk it, 
and take oft" as much froth as will heap upon 
the dish, into which lay some pieces of 
sponge cake, or some sponge biscuit, soaked 
with sweet wine, and covered with preserv- 
ed strawberries, or any other fruit; pile the 
froth upon this, and pour the remainder of 
the cream into the bottom of the dish; gar- 
nish with flowers. 

TRIFLE. (3) Cover the bottom of 
the dish with Naples biscuits, and maca- 
roons, broke in halves, wet with brandy and 
white wine, poured over them ; cover them 
with patches of raspberry jam; till the dish 
with a good custard, then wiiip up a sylla- 
bub, drain the froth on a sieve; put it on 
the custard, and strew comfits over all. 

TRIPE. Take care to have fresh tripo; 
cleanse it well from the fat, and cut ii into 
l>ieces about two inches broad and four long,; 
put it into a stewpan, and cover it with 
milk and water, and let it boil gently till it 
is tender. 

If the tripe has been prepared a it usual- 
ly is at the tripe shops, it will be enough in 
about an hour, (this depends upon how long 
it has been previously l>oiled at the tripe 
shop); if entirely undressed, it will require 
two or three hours, according to the age 
and quality of it. 

Make some onion sauce in the same man- 
ner as you do for rabbits, or boil (slowly by 
themselves) some Spanish or the whitest 
common onions you can get ; peel tl>em be- 
fore you boil them; when they are tender, 
which a middling-sized onion will be in 
about three-quarters of an hour, drain them 
in a hair oieve, take off the top skins till 



they look nice and white, and put them 
with the tripe into a tureen or soup-dish, 
and take off the fat if any floats on the 
sill lace. 

Obs. Rashers of bacon, or fried sau- 
sages are a very good accompaniment to 
boiled tripe, cow-heels or calf's feet, see 
Kelly's sauce or paisley and butter, or ea- 
per sauce, with a little \inegar and mus- 
tard added to them, or salad mixture. 

Tripe holds the same rank among solids, 
that water gruel does among soups, and the 
former is desirable at dinner, when the lat- 
ter is welcome at supper. 

TRIPE, TO FRY. Cut it into bit* 
three or four inches square; make a batter 
thicker than fir pancakes, of three eggs 
lieaten up with tlour and milk, a little salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg; dip in the tripe, and 
fry it in butter, or fresh dripping, of a light 
brown color. Swerve it garnished with pars- 
Icy. Sauce; melted butter with lemon 
pickle in it. 

TRIPE PIE. Lay into the bottom of 
a di.-h some thinly-sliced cold or raw ham, 
then put in a layer of tripe with the jelly 
adhering to it, season with [K'pper and salt, 
and add a bit of butler; fill the dish in this 
manner, and put in a few table-spoonfuls 
of brown stork; cover the dish with puff 
paste. A beefsteak may be substituted for 
the ham, laid into the bottom, and the dish 
filled up with tripe. 

TRIPE, TO BOIL. Clean it extreme- 
ly well, and take off the fat; let it lie a 
night in salt-and-water, again wash it well, 
and let it lie in milk-and-water for the same 
length of time; then cut it into small pieces, 
roll and tie them with thread ; put them, 
with a clean-washed marrow-tone, into a 
linen Ixtg; tie it closely, and put it into a 
stewpan lhat has a cover to tit quite close- 
ly, fill it up with water, and let it boil 
"etitly for six hours. Take the tripe out 
if the bag, put it into a jar, and pour over 
it the liquor in which it was boiled. When 
In I*' diesseii. boil some whole small onions 
in a part of the liquor, add a little salt, tlu-n 
put in tin- lri|M' and beat it thoromiliK. 

Or it may be fried in butter fricasseed, or 
stewed in a brown sauce. 

Instead of being boiled in a ba;j, the tripe 
may be put, with some salt and whole pep- 
per, into a stone-ware jar, which must have 
a piece of linen tied over it, and a plate laid 
upon the top. The pot should always be 
kept full of boiling water, taking care that 
it do not boil into the jar. 

TRIPE, TO ROAST. Cut the tripe 
into two oblong pieces, make a forcemeat

of bread cruml* ami chopped paisley, sea- 
soned with [lepper ami will; hind it with

with packthread. Roast, and !>astc it with 
iMitter: il will take one hour, or one hour 
and a hall". Serve it with melted butter, 
into which put a table-spoonful of ketchup 
and one of lemon pickle. 

TRIPE, HREADED. Cut your tripe 
into small square pieces, and give them a 
few turns in some butter, with parsley^ wit, 
and pepper; roll each l)it in grated bread, 
and broil them slowly. When done, serve 
them with slices of lemon. 

TROUT. This fish is held in great 
estimation, it is a fiesli water fish, and 
when food, of a tlesh color, and the spots 
upon it are very bright ; (lie female is con- 
sidered the best, and is known by the head 
lieing smaller, and the body being deeper 
than that of the male. 

TROUT, POTTED. Mix together 

the following quantity of finely-powdered 

spices: On< nee of cloves, half an ounce 

of Jamaica |x>pper, quarter of an ounce of 
black pep[>er, quarter of an ounce of cay- 
enne, two nutmegs, a litlle mare, and two 
tea-npoonfnls of ijinu'er; add the weight of 
the spices, and half as much again of salt, 
and mix all thoroughly. <'le:m the tish,and 
cut off the lie;d-, tin-:, and tails; put a t< a- 
f|iouful of the mixed spices into each fish, 
and lay them into a deep earthen jar, with 
the backs d'.wu wards; co\er them with 
elaritied Initter, tie a paper over the mouth 
of tin; jr, and bake them .-lowly for eiylit 
hnis. When the back bone is tender, the 
lish arc done enou-jh. Take them out of 
the jar, and (Hit them into a milkpan with 
the backs upwards; cover them with a 
Ix.ard, and place upon it a heavy weight. 
When |XTl'eclK cold, remove the fish into 
frcr-h jars, smooth them with a knife, and 
cover them with clarified butter. 

TKOI I. TO COLLAR. Wash them 

. split them down the back bone, and 

dry them well in a cloth; season them well 

with finely-|)oiini!ed black pepper, salt, and 

in. ire; roll them tight, and lay them 

into a dish; |>our over an equal quantity of 

ir and I HIT, with two or three liay- 

leaves, and some whole lilaek pepju-r ; tie 

over ill'- lish i -In -ei of buttered paper, and 

Lake them an hour. 

TROUT, TO P.ROIL. Cut off the tins, 
and CHI the fish down the baek, < I >sc to (In- 
bone, ami split the head in tvv>. Another 



way is, after they have been rut open, to 
rub a little salt over them; let them lie three 
or four hours, and then hang them up in the 
kitchen. They will be ready to broil the 

next morning for breakfast. 

TROUT, TO BOIL. Clean and giit 
them ; make the water as salt as for lx>il- 
ing salmon in, and when it boils put in the 
trout, and let them boil fast from fifteen 
to twenty minutes, according to their size. 
Sauce; melted Itutter. 

TROUT, TO FRY. Cut off the fins, 
clean and gut them; dust them wilh flour, 
and dip diem into the yolk of an egg beaten ; 
strew grated bread crumbs over, and fry them 
in fresh dripping; lay them upon the back 
of a sieve before the fire to drain. Sauce; 
melted butter, with a table-spoonful of 
ketchup, and one of lemon pickle in it. 
When they are email, roll them in oatmeal 
Ix'fore they are fried. 

TRUFFLFS. The truffle, like the mush- 
room, is a species of fungus common in 
France and Italy; it generally grows about 
eight or ten inches lielovv the surface of the 
ground ; as it imparts a most delicious flavor, 
it is much used in cookery. lieing dug out 
of the earth, it requires a great deal of wash- 
ing and brushing, before it can be applied to 
culinary purposes; when washed, the water 
should l>e warm, and changed frequency. Tt 
lo.-es much of its flavor when dried. 

TRUFFLE SAUCE. Mince two or 
three truffles very small, and toss them up 
! ; ,-|illy, in either oil or butter, according to 
%onr taste; then put to them four or five la- 
dlefuls of veloute and a s|xmufiil of con- 
sommt; let it boil for alxiut a quarter 
of an hour over a gentle fire, skim off all 
the fat; keep ymr sauce hot in the bain- 
marie. 

TRUFFLES TOURTE. Take two 
[xiunds of fine truffles, wash and pick them; 
put them into a .-tew pan, with six thin slice* 
of ham, a very little carrot, a sliced onion, 
i Lav, -leaf, sweet herbs in powder, salt, am( 
Champagne; lay rashers of bacon over the 
whole, and stew them to nearly a jelly. 
When cold, put the truffles into a crust wilh 
all ihe sea-oiiing; bake the towtt ,and serve 
as usual. 

TUNRRinC.E CAKES. Rub two. 

ounces of butler into half a |x>uud of dried 
flour; add a few caraway seeds, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of pminded loaf sugar; mix 
it to a -ii!) paste with a little water, toll it 
out v,i\ thin, cut it into mm id cakes with 
a ,!. is- Li the top of a diedging box, prick

them witli a fork, and bake them upon 
floured ling. 

TUNBRIDGE PUFFS. Put into a 
nicely-tinned saucepan a pint of milk, and 
when it b,>ils, stir in as much flour us will 
make it a thick batter; add lliree well- 
beaten eggs, and two or three drops of oil 
of cinnamon, or any other seasoning; dust 
a large tlat plate with (lour, with a spoon 
throw on it the batter, in the form of balls 
or fritters, and drop them into boiling cla- 
rified dripping or lard. Serve them with 
pounded loaf sugar strewed over. 

The batter may be made into a pudding, 
adding with the eggs an ounce of sail but- 
ter. Boil and serve it with a sweet sauce. 

TURBOT. Turbot, when good, should 
be thick and full,' and the belly of a yellow- 
ish while or cream color. 

TURBOT, BAKED. Wash your fish 
in several waters, dry it well, and soak it 
in melted butter, with sweet herbs, parsley, 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg; in half an hour 
put the whole into a baking dish, envelope 
it completely in bread crumbs, and bake it. 

TURBOT, BREADED. Prepare a 
small turbot as usual, slit it across the back, 
and soak it for an hour in melted butter, 
or lemon-juice, with parsley, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. Cover the fish with 
bread crumbs, and broil it; when done, 
squeeze lemon, or Seville orange-juice over 
it, and serve. 

TURBOT, STUFFED AND BAKED. 
Your turbot being properly cleansed, turn 
over the skin of the under side, without cut- 
ting it off; make a farce, with some butter, 
parsley, scallions, morels, sweet herbs, all 
shred, and united together, with yolks of 
eggs, and seasoned with pepper and salt; 
spread this all over the under part of the 
fish, cover it with the skin, and sew it up. 
Dissolve some butter in a saucepan; add to 
it when melted, the yolk of an egg, sweet 
herbs shred, salt, and pepper; rub the fish 
all over with this, then bread, and bake it.' 

TURBOT, TO BOIL. (1) This excellent 
fish is in season the greatest part of the sum- 
mer; when good, it is at once firm and ten- 
der, and abounds with rich gelatinous nu- 
trimenl. 

Being drawn, and washed clean, if it be 
quite fresh, by rubbing it lightly with salt, 
and keeping it in a cold place, you may in 
moderate weather preserve it for a couple 
of days. 

An hour or two before you dress it, soak 
it in spring water with some salt in it, then 



score the skin across the thickest part of 
the back, to prevent its breaking on the 
breast, which will happen from the fish 
swelling, and cracking the skin, if thin pre- 
caution l>e not used. Put a large handful 
of salt into a fish-kettle with cold water, 
lay your fish on a fish-strainer, put it in, 
and when it is coming to a boil, skim it 
well ; then set the kettle on the side of the 
fire, to boil as gently as possible for about 
fifteen or twenty minutes (if it boils fast, 
the fish will break to pieces); supposing it 
a middling-sized turbot, and to weigh eight 
or nine pounds. 

Rub a little of the inside red coral spawn 
of the lobster through a hair sieve, with- 
out butter; and when the turbot is dished, 
sprinkle the spawn over it. Garnish the 
dish with sprigs of curled parsley, sliced 
lemon, and finely-scraped horseradish. 

If you like to send it to table in full dress, 
surround it with nicely-fried smelts, gudg- 
eons are often used for this purpose, and may 
l>e bought very cheap when smelts are very 
dear; lay the largest opposite the broadest 
part of the turbot, so that they may form a 
well-proportioned fringe for it; or oysters; 
or cut a sole in strips, crossways, about the 
size of a smelt ; fry them and lay them 
round. Send up lobster sauce, two boats 
of it, if it is for a large party. 

Obs. The thickest part is the favorite; 
and the carver of this fish must remember 
to ask his friends if they are fin-fanciers. 
It will save a troublesome job to the carver 
if the cook, when the fish is boiled, cuts the 
spine bone across the middle. 

TURBOT, TO BOIL. (2) Put into 
the turbot kettle, with the water, two large 
handfuls of salt, and a tea-cupful of vinegar; 
when it boils very fast, take off the scum; 
put in the turbot, and when it boils again 
keep it boiling fast till the turbot rises from 
the drainer; when it is sufficiently done, 
dish and garnish it with a fringe of curled 
parsley and cut lemon. Sauces; lobster 
and melted butter. 

Cold boiled turbct eats well with salad 
sauce. 

Turbot is generally considered best per- 
fectly fresh ; but some people prefer it kept 
for a few days, hung up by the toil in a 
cool place. 

TURBOT, GRILLED. Split the fish 
down the back, and soak it for sometime, 
with melted butter, parsley, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. Bread the turbot well, 
broil, and serve it with lemon, or Seville 
orange-juice. 

TURBOT, WITH WHITE SAUCE. 

Put a sliced onion, some thyme, basil, and

sweet herbs into a stew-pan, place a small 
turbot on these, strew similar heibs, salt, 
pepper, and a leek, cut in purrs mer it ; 
cover the li.-h wild c<iual quantities of vine- 
gar, and wliilc wine; let it lx>il over a, 
moderate tiie until sufficiently done; in the 
meantime, melt a pound of butter, a. Id ID it 
a couple of boned anchovies, two s|>ooiifuls

TURKEY, BOILED. Make a stuffing 

of bread, herli.. -alt, pepper, nutmeg, lem- 
on-peel, a few oysters, or an anchovy, a bit 
of butter, some suet, and an e^; put this 
into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boil 
the turkey in a floured cloth to make it very- 
while. lla\e ready some oyster sauce 
made rich with butler, a little cream, and a 
spoonful of soy, and serve oxer the turkey, 
or you may serve over it a liver and lemon 
sauce. 

TURKKV, Tl RKEY POULTS, AND 
OTHF.K I'ori.iRY. A fowl and a turkey- 
require the same management at the fire, 
only the latter will take longer time. 

Many a Christina.* dinner has Ixjen spoil-

Turkeys, fowls, and capons have a much 
better apix-arancc, if, instead of trussing 
them with the legs close together, and the 
feet cut off, the legs are extended on each

large lardons in a mixture of salt, pepper, 
four spires, and sweet iK-ibs, and then lard 
tlie turkey with them; lay slices of bacon 
in a hraising-pan, put tlie turkey on them, 
with two small knuckles of veal, tlie feet of 
the bird, four carrots, six onions, three 
cloies, tuo liiy-le.ives, thyme, a bunch of 
:'id young onions; cover the whole 
with bacon and a piece of buttered paper; 
dilute it with four ladleful.s of stock (or 
more if the turkey be very large), put in a 
little salt, and set the pan on the lire to boil 
slowly for three hours and a half; then take 
it off, but do not take the bird out for at 
least half an hour. Strain off the liquor, 
and then reduce it to a fourth, or more if 
cry thin; break an egg into another sauce- 
pan, Ix-at it up well, and then |Mir the li- 
quor on it, whisk them well together, and 
if it wants flavor, add a few sweet herbs, 
parsley leaves, and a young onion or two; 
put it on the I'm-, stirring it violentlv until 
ready to boil; as soon as it has Killed up 
or twice; set it by Uie side of a stove, 
(Hit (ire on the top of the saucepan, and let 
it simmer half an hour; then strain it care- 
fully through a fine cloth, and let it cool to 
serve it with the turkey. 

TURKEY, HASHED. (1) Cut up the 

remains of a roasted turkey, put it into a 
siewpan, with a glass of white wine, chop- 
|H'd parsley, shallots, mushrooms, truffles, 
salt and pepper, two spoonfuls of cullis, and 
a little stock ; lx>il half an hour, and reduce 
I to a thick sauce; when ready, add a pound 
of anchovi, and a squeeze of lemon ; skim 
off all the fat from the sauce, and serve all 
togetlier. 

TURKEY, HASHED. (2) Stir a 
piece of butter rolled in flour into some 
cream, and a little veal gravy, till it boils 
up ; mince some cold roasted or boiled 
turkey, but not tew small; put it into the 
sauce, add grated lemon-peel, while pepper, 
pounded mace, a little mushroom ketchup or 
mushroom powder ; simmer it up, and serve. 
Oysters m^v Ixj added. 

TURKEY, ROASTED. It may be 

either stuffed with sausage meat, or stuffing 
the Rime as for fillet of veal. As this makes 
a large addition to the si/.e of the bird, lake 
care that the heat of the fire is constantly to 
that pait, as it frequently hapfx-ns that the 
breast is not sufficiently done. A strip of 
paper should ! put on the bone t 
Ha scorching, while the other parts are

TUR 



TURKEY, STUFFED WITH SAU- 
SAGES AND CHESTNUTS. Roast 
what quantity f chestnuts you think neces- 
sary, (jeel thorn, and pound a part of them 
to make a farce, with the liver, chopped 
parsley, shallots, a little salt and pe| |,er, a 
bit of (miter, and the yolks of three raw 
eggs, put this farce into the crop, and stmT 
the body with the whole chestnuts, and small 
nausages, first fried in butter till about half 
done ; cover the turkey wild slices ot bacon, 
and put paper over that, then roast it, and 
serve with a chestnut cnllis. 

TURNIPS, TO DRESS YOUNG 
WHITE. Wash, peel, and boil them till 
tender in water with a little salt; serve them 
with melted butter poured over them. Or, 
They may be stewed in a pint of milk thick- 
ened with a bit of butter rolled in flour, and 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and served 
with the sauce. 

TURNIPS. Peel off half an inch of the 
stringy outside. FuH-growo turnips will 
take about an hour and a half gentle boiling; 
if you slice them, which m >sl people do, they 
will be done sooner; try them with a fork; 
when tender, lake them up, and lay them on 
a sieve till the waler is thoroughly drained 
from them. Send them up whole; do not 
(lice them. 

TURNIPS, TO BOIL YEM.OW OR 
LARGE WHITK. Wash, pare, and throw 
them into cold water; put them on in boiling 
water with a little sill, and boil them from 
two hours to Iwo and a half, drain them in 
a cullender, pul them into a saucepan, and 
mixing in a bit of butter, with a beater mash 
them very smoothly, add half a pint of milk, 
mix it well with the turnips, and make them 
quite hot before serving. If they are to Ixj 
served plain, dish them us .soon as the water 
is drained off. 

TURN 7 1 P TOPS, Are the shoots which 
grow out (in the spring) of the old turnip 
roots. Put them into cold w^.er an hour 
before they are to be dressed; the more wa- 
ter they are boiled in, the l>ctter they will 
look; if boiled in a small quantity of water 
they will taste bitter: when the water boils, 
put in a small handful of salt, and then your 
vegetables; if fresh and young, they will Ix- 
done in about twenty minutes; drain them 
on the back of a sieve. 

TURTLE SOUP. (1) To dress a 
Turtle weighing one hundred and twenty 
pounds. Having cut off the head close to 
the shell, hang up the turtle till the next 
day, then open it, bearing the knife heavi- 
ly on the back of the animal in cutting it 



off all round ; turn it on its end, that all 
the blood anil water may run out, then cut 
the llesh off air, n^ the spine, sloping the knife 
towards the bones so as to avoid touching 
the gall, and having also cut the flesh from 
the leys and other meinljcrs, wash the whole 
well and drain it. A large \e.-sel of boil- 
ing water Ix-ing ready on the fire, put in 
the breast shell, and when the flutes will 
separate easily take ihem out of the waler; 
Iwil the back and bellv in water till the softer 
parts can \>e taken off easily ; (nit before they 
are sufficiently done, as they are to be again 
boiled in the sauce, lay them to cool singly 
in earthen vessels that they may not stick 
together, let the bones continue to stew for 
some time, as the lii|uor must be used for 
moistening the since*. 

All the (If-sh cut from the body, the four 
legs and head must be stewed in the following 
manner. Lay a few slices of ham on the 
lx>ttom of a large stewpan, and over the ham 
two or three knuckles of veal, then above the 
veal, the inside flesh of the turtle, and that 
of the members over the whole, adding a 
large bunch of sweet herbs, such as 'Sweet 
basil, sweet marjoram, lemon tin me, a hand- 
ful of parsley, and green onions, and a large 
onion stuck with six cloves, '('hen partly 
moisten it with the water in which the sliell 
is boiling, and when it has stewed some 
time, moisten it again with the liquor in 
which the back and belly have been lx>iled. 
When ihe legs are tender, take them out, 
drain, and put them aside to Ix' afterwards 
added tn the sauce; and when the flesh is 
completely done, drain it through a silk sieve, 
and mix with the . ancc Nimi- very thin white 
roux; then cut all the softer parts, now 
sufficiently cold, into pieces about an inch 
square, add them to the sauce, and let them 
simmer gently till they can beca.-ily pierced; 
skim it well. 

Next chop a small quantity of herbs, and 
boil them with a little sugar in lour Ixmle.-i 
of Madeira till reduced to two, then rub it 
through a tammy, mix it with the turtle 
sauce, and let it boil for a short lime. .Make 
some forcemeat balls as follows: Cut off 
ulxmt a pound of meat from the fleshy part 
of a leg of veal free from sinews or flu, soak 
in milk about the same quantity of crumbs 
of bread; when quite soft, squeeze and put 
it into a mortar, together with the veal, a 
small quantity of calf's udder, a little butter, 
the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, a little 
cayenne, salt and spices; pound the whole 
very finely, then thicken the mixture with 
two whole eggs and the yolk of a third, ihrutw 
a bit into boiling water, and if not sufficiently 
firm, add the yolk of another egg, and for 
variety some chopped parsley may Ix: mixed 
with half of the forcemeat. Let the whole 
cool so that it may be formed into bulls about

the size of the yolk of an egg, poach them in 

boiling water, and add them to the turtle. 
Before serving, mix a little cayenne with 
the juice of two or three lemons, .mil ailil it 
to the soup. It i> nencrtlly preh-rahle to 
prepare the soup (he day before it is required 
for use, and it will be Ijesl henle I in a water

is always kept very hot, l.nt not allowed to 
boil. By the same method, sauces, stews, 
and olher made dishes may ta kept fat.

and thickened with butter and Hour. 

Frirandeaux and BlanqueUM may also be 
made of the flesh of (he turtle, in the same 
way as those of veal.

from the liody. Then, early ill (he morning, 
hauni: vnnr M.IM-, and plenty of hot water 
in readiness, take the turtle, lay it on the 
table on its back, and with a strong |x>iuicd 
knife cut all round the under shell, (which is 
the callipee) ; there are joints at earl) end, 
which must lie carefully found, gently scpi-

VEAL. The names of the joints are m 
follows: Ixiin, Ix-st end Loin, chump end 
Fillet Hind Kmickfe Fore knuckle 
Neck, best end Neck, scrag end Blade 
bone Breast, best end Brisket end. 

Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, 
white, and fat, and the leg bone small. The 
finest calves have the smallest kidney, aiH it* 
being well covered with thick white fat, in- 
dicates good veal. The fillet of a cow calf 
is to be preferred, on account of the udder. 
Tlie prime joints arc tlie fillet, tlie loin, the 



VEAL 



230 



VEAL 



chomp end of the loin, and the best end of 
the neck. To keep it, the same directions 
may be followed, which are given for keeping 
beef. 

When tlie fillet is to be roasted, it should 
be WB*bed, well dried, and the bone taken 
oat, and the space tilled with a fine stuffing, 
part of which should he put under the flap, 
then formed into a round and firmly skew- 
ered. That the fire may he dt-aii and strong, 
it should be made up sometime before putting 
down the roast, which should at first be 
placed at some distance from it, and be fre- 
quently and well basted with butler. When 
about half roasted, a piece of white paper is 
tied over the fat; a little before serving, it 
is remove I, the meat is then sprinkled with 
salt, dredged with flour, and well Uisled to 
froth it. When dished, finely melted butter 
is poured over it, with which mayor may 
not l mixed some lemon pickle or brown 
gravy. It is garnished with cut lemon. 

Veal is expected to come to table looking 
delicately clean; and it is so easily' discol- 
ored, that you must be careful to have clean 
water, a clean vessel, and constantly catch 
the scum as soon and as long as it rises. 
Send up bacon, fried sausages, or pickled 
pork, greens, and ]rsley and butter, and 
onion sauce. 

Veal requires particular care to roast it a 
nice brown. Let the fire IMJ the same as for 
beef; a sound large fire for a large joint, and 
a brisker for a smaller; put it at some dis- 
tance from the fire to soak thoroughly, and 
then draw it near to finish it brown. 

When first laid down, it is to be basted; 
baste it again occasionally. When the veal 
ig on tiie dish, pour over it half a pint of 
melted butter: if you have a little brown 
gravy by you, add that to the butter. With 
those joints which are not stuffed, send up 
forcemeat in balls, or rolled into sausages, as 
garnish to the dish, or fried pork sausages; 
bacon and greens, are also always expected 
with boiled veal. 

Fillet of Veal, Of from twelve to sixteen 
pounds, will require from four to five hours 
at a good fire; make some stuffing or force- 
meat, and put it in under the Hap, that there 
may be some left to eat cold, or to season a 
hash ; brown it, and pour good melted butter 
over it. 

(iarnii-h with thin slices of lemon and 
cakes or balls of stuffing, or duck stuffing, or 
fried pork sausages, curry sauce, bacon and 
greens, &c. 

A bit of the brown outside is a favorite 
with the epicure in roasts. The kidney, cut 
out, sliced, and broiled, is a high relish, 
whicji some bans vivants are fond of. 

A Loin, Is the best part of the calf, and 
will take about three hours roasting. I'a- 
per the kidney fat, and the back: some 



cooks send it up on a toast, which is eaten 
with the kidney and ihe fat of this part, 
which is as delicate as any marrow. If 
there is more of it than you think will be 
eaten with the veal, before you roasl it cut 
it out ; it will make an excellent suet pud- 
ding; take care lo have your fire long 
enough to brown the ends; same accom- 
paniments as above. 

A Shoulder, From three hours to three 
hours nd a half; stuff it with the force- 
meat ordered for the fillet of veal, in the 
under side. 

Neck, best end, Will take two hours; 
same accompaniments as fillet. The scrag 
parl is Ix-st made into a pie, or broth. 

Breast, From an hour and a half to two 
hours. Let the caul remain till it is almost 
done, then take it off to brown it; baste, 
flour, and froth it. 

This makes a savory relish for a luncheon 
or supper: or, instead of roasting, lx>il it 
enough; put it in a cloth between two pew- 
ter dishes, uilh a weight on the upper one, 
and let it remain so till cold; then pare 
and trim, eg-,', and crumb it, and broil, or 
warm it in a Dutch oven; serve with it 
ca|xrs, or wow wow sauce. Breast of 
mutton may I* dressed the same way.

cream; thicken with luitter and flour, and 
season it with salt, a labk--s|x M infill of lemon 
pickle, or Kne\\ wine, or a pinch of curry 
powder. 

If you have no cream, beat up the yolks 
of a couple of e;",-s with a little milk: line 
the dish with sip|<otsof lightly toasted bread.

and sprinkled with a little Imtter, and brown- 
ed in a Duicli ovgn, or a cheese-toaster. 

VEAL, KEBOBBED. Cut into thin 
bits the size of a crown-piece some lean veal ; 
season them with tnmeric, |>epper, and sail. 
Slice onions very thinly, and some garlic: 
put the slices of veal and onion upon a skewer, 
together with thin bits of pickled pork. Fry 
them brown with butler, and garnish with 
plenty of fi ied parsley. 

VEAL, KNUCKLE, RAGOUT. Cut 

a knuckle of veal into slices about half an 
inch thick; pep|>er, .salt, and flour them; 
fry them a light brown ; put the trimmings 
into a stewpan, with the done broke in sev- 
eral places; an onion sliced, a head of cele- 
ry, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two blades 
of bruised mace: pour in warm water enough 
to cover them about an inch; cover the pot 
close, and let it stew very gently for a couple 
of hours; drain it, and then thicken it with 
flour and butter ; put in a spoonful of ketch- 
up, a glass of ( wine, and juice of half a lemon ; 
give it a boil up, and strain into a clean 
stewpan ; put in the meat, make it hot, 
and serve up. 

Obs. If celery is not to be had, use a 
carrot instead or flavor it with celery seed. 

VEAL KNUCKLE, STEWED WITH 
RICE. As boiled knuckle of veal cold is 
not a very favorite relish with the generality, 
cut off some steaks from it, which you may 
dress as in the foregoing receipt, and leave 
the knuckle no larger than will be eaten the 
day it is dressed. Break the shank bone, 
wash it clean, and put it in a large stewpan 
with two quarts of water, an onion, two 
blades of mace, and a tea-s|>oonful of sail : 
set it on a quick fire ; when it boils, take 
off all the scum. Wash and pick a quarter 
of a pound of rice; put it into the slewpan 
with the meat, and let it stew very gently 
for about two hours: put the meat, &c. in a 
deep dish, and the rice round it. Send up 
lcon with it, parsnips, or greens, and finely 
minced parsley and butter. 

VEAL, KNUCKLE, SOUP. A knuckle 
of veal of six pounds, weight, will make a 
large tureen of excellent soup, and is thus 
easily prepared: cut half a pound of bacon 
into slices about half an inch thick, lay it at 
the bottom of a soup-kettle, or deep siewpan, 
and on this place the knuckle of veal, having 
first chopped the bone in two or three places 
furnish it with two carrots, two turnips, a 
head of celery, two large onions, with two 
or three cloves stuck in one of tho.:n, :i doy.cn 
corns of black, and the same of Jamaica 
pepper, and a good bundle of lemon thyme, 
winter savory, and parsley. Just cover the 



meat with cold water, and set it over a quick 
fire till it boils; having skimmed it well, 
remove your soup-kettle to the side of tl>e 
fire ; let il stew very gently till it is quite 
tender, i. e. alxnit four hours ; then take out 
the bacon and veal, strain the soup, and set 
it by in a cool place till yon want it. when 
yon must take off the fat from the surface of 
your liquor, and decant it (keeping back the 
settlings at the bottom) into a clean pan. 

If you like a thickened .soup, put three ta- 
ble-spoonfuls of the fat von have laken off the 
soup into a small steu ( >.tn, and mix it with 
four table-spoonfuls of tlour, pour a ladleful 
of soup to it, and mix it with the rest by de- 
grees, and boil it up till it is smooth. 

Cut the meat and gristle of the knuckle 
and the bacon into mouthftils, and put them 
into the soup, and let them get warm. 

You may make this more savory by ad- 
ding ketchup, &c. Shin of beef may be 
dressed in the same way; see Knuckle of 
Veal stewed with Rice. 

VEAL LEG IN SURPRISE. Lard 
the veal with slips of bacon, and a little 
lemon-peel cut very thin ; make stuffing the 
same as for a fillet of veal, only mix with it 
half a pint of oysters chopped small, and 
.stuff your veal with this, and put it to stew 
with just sufficient water to cover it; let it 
stew very gently till quite tender; then take 
it up; skim off the fat from the liquor, 
and add some lemon-juice, some mushroom 
ketchup, the crumb of a roll grated fine, half 
a pint of oysters, a pint of cream, and a bit 
of butler rolled in Hour; let this sauce thick 
en over the fire, and serve it over the veal ; 
garnish the dish with oysters, dipped in 
butter, and fried, and thin slices of toasted 
bacon. 

VEAL, MINCED. Cut thin slices of 
lean cold veal; mince them verv finely with 
a knife, and season with pepper, salt, grated 
lemon-peel and nutmeg; put it into a sauce- 
pan, with a little while stock or water, a 
table-spoonful of lemon pickle, and a little 
mushroom powder. Simmer, but do not let 
it boil; add a bit of butter rolled in flour, 
and a little milk or cream; put all round 
the dish thin sippets of bread cut into a 
three-cornered shape; or cover the mince 
thickly with grated bread, seasoned with 
pepper, salt, and a little butter, and brown 
it with a salamander; or serve with poached 
eggs laid upon the top. 

VEAL OLIVES. Cut thin slices off a 
fillet, and flatten them with a roller; season 
them highly will) pepper, mace, salt, and 
grated lemon-peel; put a bit of fat into each 
roll, and tie them with a thread. Fry them 
of a light brown, and stew them in some

Beef olives may be dressed in the same 
way. 

VEAL PATTIES. Mince some under- 
ilone veal with a little parsley, one or two 

sai.'f leave-, ;i MTV little onion ; season with 
grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pep|>cr, and salt ; 
add some Dialed lean ham or tongue, moisten 
it with some good gravy, heat it up, and put 
it into the patties. 

VEAL AND HAM PATTIES. Chop 
alxiiit six ounces of ready-dressed lean veal, 
and three ounces of ham very small; put it 
into a stew pan with an ounce of butter roll-

it with minced parsley, pepper, salt, grated 
lemon-|>ecl, and nutmeg; add rather more 
than half a pint of stock made with the 
bones, thickened with a bit of butter rolled 
' in flour, and seasoned with a tea-spoonful

loin, and an e<]iial quantity of tlour, rub it 
together, and mix with it a little cold writer, 
roll it out two or three times, line the sides 
of the dish, put in the meat, and cover it. 

VEAL PIE, SOLID. Stew in veal 
stock, till it be perfectly tender and like a 
jelly, a piece of a knuckle of veal, with the 
gristles adhering to it; let it cool, and then 
pull the meat and gristles into small bita; 
Imttcr a pie dish or shape, and lay at regular 
distances some hard-boiled yolks of eggs,

pep|>er, salt, and grated nutmeg mixed, and 
a little of the gravy, and then more < 
with small bits of beet root, green pkl 
and tl>e red part of a carrot cut to fancy; 
add more meal seasoning, and all tlie gravy; 
when tlie shape is full, put it into an oven 
for twenty minutes, and when quite cold 
turn it out. If rightly done, it will have a 
glazed appearance, and the variety of col- 
ors look well by candle light. 

VEAL, POTTED. Cut slices off a teg 
of veal, and season them with pcp|>er, pound- 
ed mace, cloves, and salt. Lay thin slices 
of fiesh butter l>etween each layer of meat

and liake it with bread. When it is cold, 
|H>nnd the meat in a marble mortar, (Kick it 
into a jar, and pour clarified butter 
over it. 



VEAL, COLD, A\ EXCELLENT 

U \< ;< M'T. Either a neck, loin, or fillet of 
veal, will furnish this excellent ragout with 
a very little expense or trouble. 

Cut the veal into handsome cutlets ; put 
a piece of tauter or clean dripping into a 
i! \ I'M-pan ; as soon as it is hot, Hour and 
Ii v the veal of a light brown: take it out, 
and if you have no i;ia\\ n-ady, make some

boiling water into the frying-pan, give it a 
boil up tor a minute, and strain it into a 
basin while yon make some thickening in 
the follow ing manner: put about an ounce 
of butter into a stew pan; as soon as it nielis, 
mix with it .1- nmrli (lour as will dry it up; 
stir it over the fiie for a few minutes, and 
gradually add to it the gravy yon made in 
tlie living-pan; let them simmer together

for ten minutes (till thoroughly incorjxirat- 
ed) ; season it with pep|>er, salt, a little 
mace, and a wine-glassful of mushroom 
ketchup or wine; strain it through a tarnis 
to the meat, and stew very gently till the 
meat is thoroughly wanned. If you have 
any ready-boiled bacon, cut it in slices, and 
put it in to warm with the meat. 

VEAL ROLL. Bone a small breast of 
veal, and spread over it a rich and highly- 
seasoned forcemeat. Cut four hard-boiled 
eggs the long way into four pieces, and lay 
them in rows, with green pickles between 
each row. Roll up the veal tightly, and 
sew it; then put it into a cloth, and bind it 
with tape. Lay a slice of ham over it, and 
put it into a saucepan, together with some 
strong stock, and a little whole pepper, and 
etew it for three hours. Make a rich gru- 
vy, and boil it up with a little white wine 
and lemon-juice or lemon-pickle; po ir it 
over the veal ; add some egg and forcemeat 
balls, and garnish with cut green pickles. 
Thi- dish is very good when cold. 

VEAL SAUSAGES. Take equal quan- 
tities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful 
of sage, and a few anchovies. Beat all in 
a mortar, and season well with pepper and 
salt ; when wanted for use, roll and fry it, 
and serve either with fried sippets, or on 
stewed vegetables, or white collops. 

VEAL SEMELLES. Cut part of a 
fillet of veal into slices an inch thick, season 
them with salt and pepper, and give them a 
few turns in a little butter, with a bay leaf. 
Lay at the bottom of a deep saucepan a very 
thin slice of bacon, and on it one of the 
slices of veal, and continue to lay them in 
alternately, until the whole are used, then 
add a glass of water and some bay leaves ; 
close the saucejian very tight, first putting 
a sheet of pajier over the meat ; stew it on 
hot ashes for four or five hours; take care 
to keep the fire up to the same point all the 
time. 

VEAL STOCK. Cut a leg of veal and 
some lean ham into pieces, put them into 
a saucepan, with a quart of water, some 
carrots, turnips, onions, Iccks, and celery; 
stew them down till nearly done, but do not 
let it color; then add a sufficient quantity 
of beef stock to cover the ingredients, and 
let it boil for an hour; skim olT all the fat, 
and strain it ; a little game slewed down 
with the above will greatly improve the fla- 
vor; be particularly careful that it does not 
burn. 

VEAL SWEETBREADS ROASTED. 
Trim off the tough part, and blanch for three 



minules in a stevvpan of water, with a little 
salt, three Iwart sweetbreads, then tiikethem 
out, and put them into a basin of cold water 
till cool ; have an egg beat up in a di.-h, some 
bread cruml>s, and clarified butter, run a 
skewer through the sweetbread*, and fasten 
them on the spit; egg them all over, shake 
some bread crumbs over, then sprinkle clari- 
fied butter over, and then bread crumbs 
again; put them down to roast again for a 
quarter of an hour, then take them off the 
skewer, and serve them on a dish over a little 
butter sauce, mixed with a spoonful c.f yravy, 
a small bit of glaze, and a squeeze of lernon- 
juice; let it be hot, but not lx>iling, and 
thin oughly well mixed before it is served 
under the sweetbreads. 

VEGETABLES. There is nothing in 
which the difference between an elegant and 
an ordinary table is more wen than in the 
dressing of vegetables, more especially greens. 
They may be equally as fine at first, at one 
place as at another; but their look and 
taste are afterward very different, entirely 
from the careless way in which they have 
been cooked. 

They are in greatest perfection when in 
greatest plenty, i. e. when in (iill soa.-oti. 

By season, I do not mean those early days, 
that luxury in the buyers, and aval ice in tho 
sellers, force . the vegetables; but that time 
of the year in which by nature and common 
culture, and the mere operation of the sun 
and climate, they are in most plenty and 
perfection. 

As to the quality of vegetables, the middle 
size are preferred to the largest or the small- 
est; they are more tender, juicy, and full 
of flavor, just before thev are quite full-grown. 
Freshness is their chief value and excellence, 
and I should as stwn think of roasting an 
animal alive, as of boiling a vegetable after 
it is dead. 

The eye easily discovers if they have been 
kept too long ; they soon lose their beauty in 
all respects. 

Roots, greens, salads, &c. and the various 
productions of the garden, when first gather- 
ed, are plump and firm, and have a fragrant 
freshness no art can give them again, \\ eu 
thev have lost it by long keeping; ii 
will refresh them a little to put them into 
cold spring water for sometime before they 
are dressed. 

To boil them in soft water will preserve 
the color best of such as are green; if you 
have only hard water, put to it a tea-spoon- 
fnl of carbonate of potash. ' 

Take care to wash and cleanse them 
thoroughly from dust, dirt, and insects: this 
requires great attention. Pick off all the 
outside leaves, trim them nicely, and, if not 
quite fresh gathered and have become flaccid,

it is absolutely necessary to restore their 
- before cooking tlietn, or they will 
be ton^h and unpleasant: l;iy them in a pan 
of clean water. x\illi a handful of salt in it, 
for an hour before \mi dress tlx-ni. 

They should always l*> Ixiiled in a sauce- 
jn by themselves, and have plents <!' water; 
if moat is boiled with them in I hi/ same pot, 
they will spoil ihr look and teate of each other. 

It' you wish to have vegetables delicately 
cli an, put on \our |)ot, make it Ixiil, put a 
little salt in il, anil skim it |x-ileetU clean 
Ijefore you put in the green<, ^r.; which 
should not lie put in till the water Ixiils brisk- 
ly: the quicker they lioil, the livelier they 
will l>c. When thevcgetable< sink, tJley are 
generally done enough, if tin- water lias been 
kept constantly Ixiiliiiij. Take them up im- 
mediately, or liny will lose their color and 
goodness. Drain the water from them 
thoroughly before you send them to table. 

This branch of cookery requires the most 
vigilant alien! ion. 

If vegetables are a minute or two too long 
over the (ire, they lose all their beauty and 
flavor. 

If not thoroughly boiled tender, they are 
tremendously indigestible, and much more 
troublesome diirii.ir their residence in the 
Btomach, than under-done meats. 

Once for all, take care your vegetables 
are fre-h: lor as the fishmonger often suffers 
for the gins of tlie rook, so (he cook often 
gets undeservedly blamed instead of the 
green -grocer. 

Stroii.- _ . tables should be kept 

apart; leeks, or celery, laid among cauli- 
flowers, kc. will quickly s|x>il them. 

Succulent vegetables are best preserved in 
a cool, shady, and damp plape. 

Potatoes, turnijw, carrots, ami similar 
root-;, intended to U: stored up, should never 
l)e cleaned from the earth adhering to them, 
till they are to be dressed. 

They must be protected from the action 
of the air ami frost, by laving them in heaps, 
l)ur\ini; them in -and or earth, &c., or cov- 
ering them with str.iw or mats. 

When vegetable* are quite fresh gathered, 
they will ii"i require so much boiling, by at 
least a third of the time, aa wlien they have 
been gathered the usual time of those that 
arc brought to public markets. 

Vegetables are always best wlien newly 
gathered, and should be brought in from the 
garden early in the morning; they will then 
have a fragrant freshnov, which they lose by 

keeping. 

Tin \ must be cleaned with tlie greatest 
care, tiie outside leaves of ever)- description 
of greens removed, and they, and all* other 
vegetables, more nrtieularK when not re- 
cently gathered, should lie laid for several 
Uotirs in cold water, and well shaken to 



throw out the insects. A ten-spoonful of 
salt should always ! put into the water in 
which they are to be boiled, and if it is hard, 
a tea-spoonful of salt of tartar, or (mtash, 
may be added to preserve tlie green color of 
the vegetables. 

All vegetables should be boiled quickly, 
and, with the exception of spinach, in an 
open vessel, skimming them carefully. 

Kitchen u'nrns should be kept in a cool 
and shady place. Potatoes, carrot?, turnips, 
and beet root should be stored up, without 
being cleaned from the earth adhering to 
them, in layers of sand, or laid in heaps, and 
covered with earth and straw. Parsnips and 
skirrets not being injured by frost, are gen- 
erally left in tlie ground, and taken up aa 
wanted. Onions are stored in a warm, dry 
place, never in a cellar; they are sometimes 
strung in bunches, and suspended from the 
roof, and, more effectually to prevent tlieir 
growing, some people select the finest bulbs, 
and singe tlie roots with a hot iron. 

Herbs of all sorts should be gatliered when 
in flower, ami on a dry day, and being well 
cleaned from dust and dirt, tliey are tied up 
in small bunches, and dried before tlie fire in 
a Dutch oven. They may then be kept in 
paper bags labelled ; or rubbed to a powder, 
sifted, and put into bottles. 

VEGETABLE ESSENCES. The fla- 
vor of tho various sweet and savory herbs 
may be obtained by combining their essen- 
tial oils with rectified spirit of wine, in the 
proportion of one drachm of the former to 
two ounces of the latter, or by picking the 
leaves, and laying them for a couple of 
hoars in a warm place to dry, and then fill-, 
ing a large-mouthed bottle with them, and! 
pouring on them wine, brandy, proof spirit, 
or vinegar, and letting them steep for four- 
teen da\s. 

VEGETABLE MARROW, IB fit for 

use when about the size of a turkey's egg. 
After being washed clean, it is put on in 
boiling water, with a little salt, and when 
tender, it is drained from the water, rut into 
half, and served on toasted bread, over 
which some melted butter has been poured. 
Or, after being boiled in milk and water, 
they may be fricasseed as Jerusalem arti- 
chokes, or stewed like cucumbers. 

VEGETABLES STEW. Pick and 
wash very clean as much spinach as wifl 
make a tlish ; mince finely three small on- 
ions, pick and el nip two handful* of parsley; 
put all into a saucepan, with rather more 
than half a pint of gravy, a bit of butter 
dusted with lloiir, a little salt and pepper. 
< 'i.\rr the pan closely, stir it now and then, 
and when the spinach ' tender, mash it

smooth, serve it with slices of broiled ham, 
or with sausages. 

VELOUTE. Take the cuttings and re- 
mains of any joints of veal and fowl you 
maj have in the house, of which take four 
pounds, and put into a large stewpan, with 
some carrots, onions, parsley, scallions, 
three I>ay-leave8, three cloves, and a ladle- 
fol of stock; put your stewpan on a fierce 
fire, skim it well, and take care that the 
meat docs not stick; when sufficiently re- 
duced, add as much stock as will nearly fill 
the stewpan, salt it well; give it a noil, 
skim it, and then put it on the side of the 
fire to simmer for two hours; after which 
strain it through a tammy. Make a white 
rottx, stir into it for ten minutes a few 
champignons, then pour on it, a little at a 
time, the ubove liquor; let it boil up once, 
skim it, and set it again by the side of the 
fire lor an hour and a half: take off all the 
fat, str.iin it again, and then out it by for 
use. Take care that the veloute is not in 
the least colored, as, the whiter it is the 
better. 

VENISON. The choice of venison 
should be regulated by the appearance of 
the fat, which, when the venison is young, 
looks thick, clear, and close; as it begins 
to change first towards the haunches, run a 
knife into that part; if tainto! \on will 
perceive a rank smell, and it will have a 
green or blackish appearance. 

If you wish to preserve it, you may by 
careful management and watching, keep it 
fora fortnight by the following method: wash 
it well with milk and water very clean, and 
dry it pei fectly with cloths until there is not 
the Ic'a.-t damp remaining, then dust pound- 
ed ginger over every part ; this is a good 
preventive against the fly. When to be 
dressed, wash it with a little lukewarm 
water, and dry it. Pepper should also be 
added to keep it. 

VENISON COLLOPS. These are 

dressed in the same manner as mince col- 
lops of beef, only that, in place of the sea- 
soning of tlie collops of beef, they have a 
little pepper, salt, and some Port wine. 

VENISON, HASHED. (1) If yon have 
enough of its own gravy left, it is preferable 
to any to warm it up in : if not, take some 
of the mutton gravy, or the lx>nes and trim- 
mings of the joint (after you have cut off all 
the handsome slices you can to make the 
hash) ; put these into some water, and stew 
them gently for an hour; then put some but- 
ter into a stewpan; when melted, put to it 
us much flour as will dry up the butter, and 
Btjr it well together; add to it by degrees 



tlie gravy yon have been making of the trim- 
mings, and some red currant jelly ; give k a 
lioil up; skim it; strain it through a sieve, 
and it is ready to receive the venison: put it 
in, and let it just get warm: if you let it 
boil, it will make the meat hard. 

VENISON, HASHED. (2) Warm it 
in its own gravy; if there is no fat left, take 
some slices of mutton fat, set it on the fire 
with a little Port wine and sugar, and let it 
simmer till dry; then add it to the hash. 

VENISON, HASHED. (3) Takesome 

anchovies, boil them till they are dissolved, 
then add some oysters with their liquor, a 
little milk, some red wine, and a little ketch- 
up; put in your venison, let it warm in this, 
but do not let it boil, and serve it with fried 
sippets, and the sauce &c. over it. 

VENISON, MOCK. Hang up, for 
several days, a large fat loin of mutton ; then 
bone it, and take off all the kidney fat, and 
the skin from the upper fat; mix together 
two ounces of brown sugar, and one ounce 
of ground black pepper. Rub it well into 
the mutton ; pour over it two or three wine- 
glasses of Port wine; keep it covered with 
the skin; rub and turn it daily for five days. 
When to be roasted, cover it with the skin, 
and paper it the same way as venison is 
dono Aorvo it u-ith made gravy, and the 
same sauces as for venison. 

VENISON PASTY. (1) Cut a neck or 
breast into small steaks, nib them over with 
a seasoning of sweet herbs, grated nutmeg, 
pepper, and salt; fry them slightly in butter; 
line the sides and edges of a dish with puff 
paste, lay in the steaks, and add half a pint 
of rich gravy made with the trimmings of 
the venison ; add a glass of Port wine, and 
the juice of half a lemon, or tea-spoonful of 
vinegar; cover the dish with puff paste, and 
bake it nearly two hours; some more gravy

VENISON PASTY. (2) Trfke a neck, 
shoulder, or breast of venison, that has not 
hung too long; bone them, trim off all the 
skin, and cut it into pieces two inches square, 
and put them into a stewpan, with three 
gilla of Port wine, two onions, or a few 
eschalots sliced; some pepper, salt, three 
blades of in, ice, about a dozen allspice, and 
enough veal broth to cover it; put it over a 
glow fire, and let it stew till three parts done; 
put the trimmings into another saucepan, 
cover it will) water, and set it on a fire. 
Take ait the pieces yon intend for the pasty, 
ami put them into a deep dish with a little 
of their liquor, and set it by to cool ; then 
add the remainder of the liquor to the bones

ready; then cover (Ire pasty with paste, orna- 
mpnt the top, anil bake it lor two houis in a 
slow oven; and before it is sent to table, 
pour in a ,-ance inadi; with tl>e giavy tlie^ 
venison was slewed in, strained and skimmed 
free from fat; some pepper, salt, half a gill 
of Port, (In- juice oflialf a lemon, and a little 
flour and butler to tliirken it. 

\IMS()\ FIE OR PASTY. All 

kinds of UK MI intended t' pies and pasties 
must lie highly spiced when served hot, and 
still more highly spiced when served cold; | 
but the seasoning must be regulated by judg- 
ment and taste. Take one or two breasts 
of venison, (.iccording to the size you wish 
to make your pie or pa-ty ), bone it thorough- 
ly, l>cai it v- i\ lint, aiul lard it through and 
through with lardona, well seasoned witli all 
sorts of spires, anI svv eet hell is finely chop- 
ped; roll it up as tight as possible, and tie 
it up w ilh strong twine. Put into a stewpan 
the bones and trimmings of the venison, w ith 
can of.-. .-|,,ve of gai li.-, 

thyme, bay -leaf, |jep|'i -corns, and allspice,

then put in the roll i>f vm-i>n ; put paper on 
tlie top, cover veiy clo.-c, and let it Mew 
gently with (ire over and under. When 
sufficiently done, take it off the lire, and lei 
it stand in tlie liquor until neailv cold; then 
pre|>are a plain paste of lour pounds of lloni to 
one pound of butter, the same as for i 
pie, but instead of making it stiff, mix it as 
soft as possible; lay part of this paste as 
thick as yon well can round the edge of the 
dish; cut off the. twine from tlie venison, 
ckin, and lay it in tlie dish, and pour - 
of the gravy it h;ui stewed in; put on the 
cover, trim it very neatly, make a hole in 
the top, do it over with egg, and bake it in 
a moderate oven fir three or four honis; 
reduce tlie remainder of the liquor it waa 
slewed in, and when the pie is baked, |>onr 
it in; serve it cold. The pasty can scarcely 
be made too thick. 

VERMICELLI, QUEEN'S Blanch 
bout a quarter of a pound of vermicelli in 
boiling water, drain it, and throw it into 
Rome rich well-eeaaoncd stock ; when lender,

V HUM l< T.I.LI IN MILK. Boil the 
quantity ol milk yon may require, and put 
into it half a pound of vermicelli peeled, and 
sufficient quantity of sugar ; stir it frequent- 



ly that the vermicelli may not form a paste: 
half an hour will be long enough to boil it. 
A little almond milk may be added when 
ready for table. 

VERMICELLI PUDDING. (1) Boil 

a quarter of a pound of vermicelli with a 
little cinnamon, in a quart of milk; in the 
meantime mix a quarter of a pound of melt- 
ed butter w ith a pint of cream, and the yolks 
of four eggs; pour in the vermicelli when 
quite soft ; add a little flour and lieef mar- 
row, and powder sugar to the taste ; beat alt 
up for half an hour, tie it in a Homed cloth, 
and boil it. 

/VERMICELLI PUDDING. (2) Boil 

four ounces of vermicelli in a pint of new 
milk, until quite tender, with a stick or two 
of cinnamon. Then add half a pint of thick 
cream, a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
quarter ol a pound of sugar, and the yolks 
of four eggs, thoroughly beaten; lay the 
above in a dish and bake. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. Take as much 
good stock as yon require for your tureen, 
strain, and set it on the fire, and when it 
boils, put in the vermicelli, and let it simmer 
for half an hour by a .-low tire, that tlie ver- 
micelli may not IIIIIM; the soup ought not to 
l>e \e. \ iliirk. Half a pound is sufficient 
for eight or ten persons. 

VINEGAR. Thisisan acid liquor.pre- 
pared by a second fermentation from various 
liquois. such as wine, cider, perry, beer, 
mead, skimmed milk, &c. But tin; most 
common method of making it, in England, 
is from malt, and the process is as follows: 
infuse a quantity of malt in hot water for an 
hour and a half, then pour it into a cooler. 
Aa Koon as the infusion is sufficiently cold, 
put it into deep tuns, add yeast to it, and 
leave it to ferment for lour or five days ; after 
which put the liquor into barrels, in a room 
healed w ith stoves, so that a moderate warmth 
may be kept up for six weeks, and the fer- 
mentation continue regularly. By tlie end 
of that time the whole will be completely 
."onred. am! must now be changed into other 
barrels; lay a tile on tlie bung-holes to keep 
out tlie wet, but not so do-e as to prevent a 
free circulation of air, and then place them 
in (he open air for four or five months, ac- 
cording as the weatlieris warmorotlierwise; 
during the whole of this period, the fermenta- 
tion proceeds, and at tlie end, the vinegar is 
nearlv done. The next operation is this: the 
vinegar is poured into large vessels, called 
rapetuns, to which tliere are false bottoms cov- 
ered with rape, that is, the refuse of raisins, 
or oilier fruit, from which wine has been 
made; fill one of these tuns entirely with

the vinegar, and another about tliree-fourtlis 
full, and every day take a portion of the 
liquor out of the fullest barrel, and put it into 
the other, until the vineg:ir is in a lit stale to 
be drawn off; when it must be closely bar- 
relled. 

Vinegar may also he made in much smaller 
quantities for domestic purposes; (lie mate- 
rials of various kinds, with the addition of 
sugar; raisins, currants, and ripe goose- 
berries, however, are the principal ; some- 
times it is made from brown sugar, and wa- 
ter alone. The proportions are the same as 
those necessary for strong wine; make the 
barrel about three-fourths full, add a toast 
covered with yeast, put in the bung very 
loosely, and place the barrel where it will 
be exposed to the sun, or, if it be winter, 
near the fire. The fermentation should be 
moderate and constant till the vinegar is 
complete ; then draw it off clear, give it a 
boil, and when quite cold, strain and bottle 
it. 

Vinegar is obtained from wine, by mixing 
with the latter its own dowers, or ferment, 
and its tartar reduced to powder, and put 
into a vinegar or any other cask ; if the 
latter, it must be placed in a warm situation, 
full (if the steam from vinegar; in either case 
the liquor should lie stirred frequently ; the 
second fermentation will s|>eedily commence; 
it will become heated, and turn acid by de- 
grees, and in a short time the vinegar will 
be produced. 

It is commonly supposed that wine which 
has become acid, will produce excellent vin- 
egar ; this, however, is a mistaken idea, for 
die stronger and better the quality of the 
wine, the stronger and better will be the 
vinegar. 

The French have several methods of mak- 
ing vinegar, which are subjoined. 

Tlie vinegar makers of Orleans pour the 
wine, of which they intend to make their 
vinegar, into casks, at the bottoms of which 
are close gratings of lime twigs; these serve 
to clarify the wine, as the lees adhering to 
the twigs, leave the liquor perfectly clear. 
They then procure a number of casks, each 
containing a hundred gallons, either new or 
which have previously contained vinegar; 
these are set upright, and in the top of every 
one is bored a hole, two inches in diameter, 
these are kept constantly open : tlie last men- 
tioned casks are called Mothers; pour into 
all of them twenty-live gallons of boiling 
vinegar; to this, in a week's time, add 
three gallons of wine, drawn from tlte first 
mentioned casks; continue to add tlsc -.vine, 
at intervals of a week, until the Mothers 
are quite full ; then leave them for a fortnight, 
and at the end of which period they generally 
draw off the vinegar, taking care always to 
leave the Mothers half full, at least, and 



then to fill them with wine as before. The 
method of proving when the vinegar is fit for 
use, is, by plunging a stave into it; if on 
taking it out, a white line is (XTceptible on 
the end of it, the vinegar is quite ready. 
The place where the casks are kept should 
be very airy, and in the winter lime, by 
means of stoves tlie temperature should be 
raised to eighteen degrees of Reaumur. 

Paris vinegar varies from the above, and 
the process is veiy simple. A large quantity 
of wine lees is put into coarse sacks, and 
laid in tubs, which are placed one upon an- 
other to form a kind of press; by means of 
a screw, every drop of wine is gradually 
squeezed from the lees ; thisoperat ion cannot 
U- |XTlormc<l in less time than a \\cck. The 
wine thus extracted is put into casks; in 
the headings a hole is made, as above, which 
holes are left constantly open; in summer 
time the casks so filled are placed in the sun, 
and, generally speaking, the vinegar is fit 
for use in a fortniglrt. In the winter, tlie 
fermentation will last double the time, and 
must be assisted by artificial warmth. It 
sometimes happens that the liquor heats to 
so great a degree that tlie hand cannot be 
borne in it ; in this case, the progress of 
the fermentation must be checked by adding 
more wine, until it proceeds more regularly. 
When the vinegar is made, put it into casks, 
which have the beech twigs at the bottom, 
as above mentioned; let it remain a fort- 
night, by which time it will lie sufficiently 
fermented to draw off into the casks for 
keeping it. 

Another very simple method is also prac- 
tLed in France; a few quarts are drawn 
from a barrel of excellent vinegar, and an 
equal quantity of very clear white wine is 
put into the barrel, close the bung lightly, 
and keep it in a place where the heat is 
moderate and regular. In a month's time 
draw off the same quantity as alxjve, and 
pour in an equal portion of white wine. A 
barrel of good vinegar will thus afford a 
constant supply for a length of time without 
leaving the slightest deposit. 

A cask which has not contained vinegar 
before, should have a quart of boiling hot 
vinegar poured into it, shaken till cold, and 
allowed to stand for some hours. 

VINEGAR, BASIL. Sweet basil is in 
full perfection about the middle of August. 
Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with the fresh 
green leaves of basil (these give much finer 
and more flavor than tlie dried,) and cover 
:!i. .M with vinegar, or wine, and let them 
steep for ten days: if yon wish a very strong 
essence, strain the liquor, put it on some 
fresh leaves, and let them steep fourteen days 
more. 

Obs. This U a very agreeable addition

to sauces, soups, and to die mixture usually 
made fur salads. 

It is a secret the makers of inock turtle 

may tliank us for telling; a table-spoonful 
put" in when the soup is finished will impreg- 
nate a tureen of soup with the basil aod acid 
flavors, at very -mall cost, when fresh basil 
and lemons art: extravagantly dear. 

The flavor of the other sweet and savory 
herbs, celery, &<:. uiay be procured, and pre- 
served in the -a.ne. manner by infusing them 
in wine or \ ine^ar. 

VINEGAR, AMERICAN. Boil six 
gallons of water, and add, while it is hot, 
four quarts of molasses ; put it into a tub to 
cool; when milk warm, stir in a pint of 
i-t ; put it into the cask, and set it 
by the lire lor twenty-fair hours; then put 
it in ilx' sun, uiih a bottle in the bong-hole. 
Botlle it three months afterwards. 

VINEGAR, m'RNET OR CUCUM- 
BER. This is made in precisely lli .-ame 
manner as dint-ted alxive. The flavor of 
buriK-l resembles cucumber so exactly, that 
when infused in vinegar, the nicest palate 

would prom << it to Ix- cucimiljcr. This

TARRAGON. Fill a quart bottle with 
llie flowers of elder, or the leaves of tarragon, 
when it is in flower; pour vinegar upon 
t'eni, and let them infuse for a fortnight; 
then strain it through a flannel bag, and put 
it into small bottles. By the same meaiiv, 
vinegar may be flavored with the fresh gath- 
ered leaves of any sweet herb. 

VINEGAR, GARLIC. Cut small one 

ounce and a half of garlic, bruise one nutmeg 
and diree cloves, steep them in a quart of 
vinegar for a week, shaking it daily ; then 
strain and bottle it. Shallot vinegar is made 
in the same manner. 

VINEGAR, GOOSEBERRY. Gather 
yellow gooseberries when quite ripe, crush 
and mash them well in a tub with a large 
wooden pestle; to every two gallons of 
gooseberries, after being mashed, put two of 
water; mix them well together; let it work 
for three weeks, stirring the ma.-s two or 
three times each day; then strain the liquor 
through a hair sieve, and put to every gallon 
one pound of brown sugar, one pound of 
treacle, and a table-spoonful of fresh yeast; 
let it work lor three or four days in the same 
tub, which has l>een well wasln*! ; then run 
it into iron-hooped casks. Let it stand 
twelve months, and bottle it for use. This 
is a very strong vinegar. 

VINEGAR, HONEY. Half a pound 
of honey must be put to a pint of wa- 
ter, and the honey well dissolved. This 
mixture is then exposed to tlie greatest heat 
of (he Min, without closing wholly tlie bung- 
hole of the c;isk, which must be merely cover- 
ed with coarse linen, to prevent the admission 
of insects. In alxmt six weeks, the liquor 
becomes acid, and changes to a very strong 
vinegar, and of excellent quality. 

VINEGAR, HORSERADISH. Horw- 

radish is in highest perfection about Novem- 
ber. Four a quart of best vinegar on threw 
ounces of sciajx-d horseradish, an ounce of 
rninced eschalot, and one drachm of cay- 
enne; let il stand a week, and vou ill have 
an excellent relish fur cold beef, salads, &c. 
costing scarcely any thing. A portion of 
black pepper and miistaid. celery or crett- 
seed, may be added to the above. 

VINEGAR, RASPBERRY. The best 
way to make this, is to pour three pints of 
the best white wine vinegar on a pint and a 
half uf fresh-gatliered ted rasplierries in a 
stone jar, or china bowl (neither glazed 
earthfimat'e, nor any metallic vessel, must 
lie used ; ) the next day strain the liquor over 
a like q-iantity of fresh raspberries ; and the 
day following do the same. Then drain off

the liquor without pressing, and pass it 
through a jelly-bag (previously wetted with 
plain vinegar) into a stone jar, with a pound 
of pounded lump sugar to e.ieh pint. When 
the sugar is dissolved, stir il up, cover down 
the jar, and set it in a saucepan 1 of water, 
and keep boiling for an hour, taking off the 
scum; add to each pint a glass of brandy, 
and IxUlle it: mixed in about eight parts of 
water, it is a very refreshing and delightful 
summer drink. An excellent cooling bever- 
age to assuage thirst in ardent fevers, colds, 
and inflammatory complaints, &c. and is 
agreeable to most palates. 

VINEGAR FOR SALADS. Take of 

tarragon, savory, chives, eschalots, three 
ounces each; a handt'il of the tops of mint 
and balm, all dry and pounded; put into a 
wide-mouthed liottle, widi a gallon of best 
vinegar; cork it close, set it in the sun, and 
in a fortnight strain off, and squeeze the 
herbs ; let it stand a day to settle, and then 
strain it through a filtering bag. 

VOL-AU-VENT. (1) Cut some cold 
tin-key or veal into small thin slices, season 
it with dried lemon-peel grated, pepper, 
pounded mace, and salt ; add one anchovy, 
some garlic and onion pounded, also a little 
good gravy, a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, 
one of white wine, and an ounce of butter 
rolled in flour; then make it <)uite hot, but 
do not allow it to boil, and serve it in the 
prepared vol-au-vent. The gravy may l>e 
made with the bones, or a little cream, and 
the beaten yolk of an egg may be substituted 
for the cream. 

VOL-AU-VENT. (2) In opening the 
oysters, separate them from the liquor, which 
must be strained ; take off the beards, and 
add to them the liquor, together with some 
white stock, a bit of butter rolled in flour, 
two or three blades of mace, a bit of lemon- 
peel, pepper, and salt ; simmer them for fifteen 
or twenty minutes, and a little before putting 
them into tlie vol-au-vent, pick out the lemon- 
|>eel, add a table-spoonful of white wine, and 
three of good cream, and make it quite hot. 
To make oyster patties, when they are to be 
bearded, cut them into three or four bits, 
and prepare them in the same manner. 

VOL-AU-VENT. (3) Roll off tart paste, 
till about the eighth of an inch thick: then, 
with a tin cutler made for that purpose 
(about the size of the bottom of the did) you 
intend sending to table,) cut out the shape, 
and lay it on a baking-plate with paper; 
rub it over with yolk of egg ; roll out good 
puff paste an inch thick, stamp it with the 
same cutter, and lay il on the tart paste; 
then take a cutter two sizes smaller, and 



press it in the centre nearly through the puff" 
paste; rub the top with yolk ot egg, and 
bake it in a quick oven about twenty minutes, 
of a light brown color: when done, take out 
the paste inside the centre mark, preserving 
the top, put it on a dish in a warm place, 
and when wanted, fill it with a white frica- 
see of chicken, rabbit, ragout of sweetbread, 
or any other entree you wish. 

VOLDRON . Melt eleven ounces of fresh 
butter in a brass pan, and when quite hot, 
add tlie same quantity of pounded loaf sugar, 
and eight well-beaten eggs; stir constantly 
for six or eight minutes, and [Hit it into a 
dish; the following day, mix with it a nine 
glass of orange- flower water; of citron, 
orange, and lemon-peel, cut fine, half a 
pound; butter a pudding dish, and lay into 
the bottom a sheet of white pa|>er buttered, 
then put in the voldron, and bake it for 
twenty minutes; turn it out, ornament it 
with cut citron and orange-peel, and serve 
it in a silver or glass dish. 



W. 

WAFERS. Take a pint of good cream, 
half a pound of sifted flour, half a pound of 
powder sugar, and two drachms of orange- 
flower water. Beat the cream with the 
flour, a little at a time, until both are mixed 
perfectly smooth and free from lumps, tlien 
add the other articles; and as much more 
creain as will make the paste nearly us thin 
as milk ; make the iron hot, dip a leather in 
si line melted butter, and rub the iron over 
with it; put on die iron about a spoonful 
and a half of the paste, press them a little 
gently, and place the iron on a stove; open 
the iron a little frequently, to see if it be 
done; when one side is baked, turn the iron, 
and do the other. The wafers should only 
be lightly colored. Take them from the 
mould carefully with a knife.

WAFERS, GERMAN. Take seven- 
teen ounces of sifted flour, and half a pint of 
good yeast, which make into a paste, with 
as much warm milk as will malic it run from 
the spoon freely, without being too clear; 
then put it into a warm place. When it has 
risen well, add to it the yolks of fourteen 
eggs well beaten, the whites whipped to a 
snow, and the grated rind of two lemons. 
The whole being well mixed, pour over it 
seventeen ounces of fresh butter melted, but 
not too hot; stir it gently with a wooden 
spoon, and put tlie preparation again into a 
warm place to rise a second time; when it 
lias risen sufficiently, and your pan quite hot, 
rub tlie latter with butter, fill it with the

paste, set it over a brisk fire, and fry your 
wafers; make Ixnh sides equally brown; 
when dune, sprinkle them with powder >HL; u 
(and cinnamon, if you like), and serve them 
hot. Be c.irefnl in tuking out the paste to 
fill the |wn, not to disturb, nor to plunge the 
spoon into tlie preparation, when not nsiii^ 
it; the upper jiart nf the pasie should be 
taken off very gently, and the spoon laiil 
across the top of the vessel ; if these precau- 
tions be not attended to, the good appear- 
ance of the wafers will be destroyed. 

\\-\\ T.KS, ITALIAN. Take eight 
eggs, toiirteen ounces of powder sugar, a 
pound of Hour, six ounces of cream, th<- 
of milk, an ounce of oramj- (lowers, and the 
rind of a lemon Dialed. Heat tlie eggs with 
the sugar and (lour first ; then add the cream,

Gather them fcr pickling when tlie head of 
a pin will pierce them easily; run a lat ,.- 
needle through them here and there, or score 

tin-in on one side with a knife; lay them 
into a brine of salt-and-water lor " i 
days, changing the brine twice in that time; 
strain, and put lliem into a jar, and sprinkle 
a little silt over them. Boil four qua 



vinegar for a hundred walnuts, allowing to 
each quart one ounce of whole pepper, and 
one of ginger, half an ounce each of sliced 
nutmeg and whole allspice, a table-spoonful 
of mustard seed, and one of scraped horse- 
radish, one head of garlic, or a small onion; 
|ur it boiling hot over the nuts, and put a 
plate on die jar; when cold, tie it closely 
down. After the nuts are used, the liquor 
may be boiled, strained, and bottled, to use 
as a pickle. 

WALNUT KETCHUP. (1) Thorough- 
ly well bruise one hundred and twenty young 
walnuts; put to them three quarters of a 
pound of salt, and a quart of good wine vin- 
egar; stir them every day for a fortnight; 
then strain and squeeze the liquor from them 
throtiji a cloth, and set it aside; put to the 
husks half a pint of vinegar, and let it stand 
: then strain and squeeze them as

on laie side of the tub, anil at the same liiiiv 
by raising the tub on that side, the liquor 

] will drain clear off to tin- other; then take 
that liquor out: the 'mashing and bunking- 
up may be repeated as often as liquor is 
found. The quantity will be about six 
quarts. When done, let it be simmered in 
an iron boiler as long as any scum arises; 
then Imiise a quarter of a pound of ginger, a 
quarter of a [xnmd of allspice, two ounces of 
long [Helper, two ounces of cloves, with ihe 

; above ingredients; let ii si .wlv boil lor half 
an hour; when bottled, let an equal quantity 

' of tlie spice go into each boltle ; when cork- 
ed, let the bottles I* filk.il quite up: cork 
[ii'-iii tight, seal them over, and put tliem 
into a cool and dry place for one year before 

| they are used. 

WALNUT KETCHUP, FOR FISH 

SAUCE. Take a quart of walnut pickle, 
add to it a quarter of a pound of anchovies 
and ihree-qnaiters of a pint of red Port, and 
let it boil till reduced to one-third; then 
strain it, and when cold, put it into small 
Untie.-, and keep them closely corked.

WHI 



WALN UT PICKLE. Put any quanti- 
ty of the outside shells or green rinds of 
ripe walnuts into a tub in which there is a 
tap-hole; sprinkle them with water, raise 
the tub on one side, that it may stand in a 
sloping direction, place another vessel under 
it to receive the juice as it drops from the 
tap-hole; this it will soon begin to do; and, 
when a sufficient quantity has been obtained, 
to one gallon of this black liquor add two 
large table-spoonfuls of salt, one large onion, 
a stick of horseradish, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two bay leaves, a quarter of an ounce 
of black pepper, the same of allspice and of 
bruised ginger. Boil it slowly for twenty 
minutes; strain it, and, when cold, slir it 
and bottle it for use, putting the spice into 
the bottles. 

WALNUTS, TO PICKLE. Gather 
the nuts before the inside shell is hard, which 
may be known by trying them with a pin; 
Jay them into salt and water nine days, 
changing the liquor every three days; then 
take them out, and dry them in the air on a 
sieve or mat; they should not touch each 
other, and they should be turned, that every 
side may become black alike; then put 
(hem into a jar. When half the nuts are 
in, put in an onion, with about thirty cloves 
stuck into it. and add the rest of the nuts. 
To one hundred walnuts allow half a pint 
of mustard seed, a quarter of an ounce of 
mace, half an ounce of peppercorns, and 
sixty bay leaves; boil all the spice in some 
good common vinegar, and pour it boiling 
upon the nuts, observing that they are en- 
tirely covered ; stop the mouth of the jar 
with a cloth, and when cold, cover it with 
bladder or leather. In about six weeks 
they will be fit for use, when they should lie 
examined, and if they have absorbed the 
vinegar so much as to leave any of the nuts 
dry, more should be added, but it need not 
be boiled. 

WATER SOUCHY. Make a stock 
with three or four flounders, boiled in three 
quarts of water, two onions, and a bunch of 
parsley, till they are soft enough to pulp 
through a sieve with tlie liquor they were 
boiled in; then season it with pepper, salt, 
and some parsley chopped, and boil in it a 
few flounders, with the brown skin taken 
off, some nicely cleaned perch or tench. 
Serve in a tureen, and with slices of bread 
and butter to eat with it. 

\VELSH RABBIT. Pare the crust off 
a slice of bread, toast it nicely, divide it in 
two, butter it, and lay upon each half a thin 
slice of cheese which has been toasted in a 
Dutch oven ; if, when put upon the toast, it 
is not sufficiently browned, hold a salaman- 



der, or hot shovel, over the top. Serve it 
very hot. 

WHEY. (1) Make a pint of milk boil; 
put to it a glass or two of white wine ; put it 
on the fire till it just boils again ; then set it on 
one side till the curd has settled ; pour off 
the clear whey, and sweeten it as you like. 

Cider is often substituted for wine, or 
half the quantity of vinegar that we have 
ordered wine. When there is no fire in 
the sick room, this may be put hot into a 
bottle, and laid between the bed and mat- 
tress; it will keep \varm several hours. 

WHEY. (2) Put a very small portion 
of rennet into a quart of milk, and let it 
stand by the side of the fire until turned; 
then serve it in a dish, with sugar and a 
little nutmeg, grated, and strewed over, or 
strain the liquor carefully from the curd, 
and serve quite clear. 

WHEY, WHITE WINE. Boil a 
pint of milk, and when it rises in the pan, 
pour in one glass of sherry and one of cur- 
rant wine; let it again boil up, take it off 
the fire, and, when it has stood a few min- 
utes, remove the curd, pour off the clear 
whey, and sweeten it. 

WHIM WHAM. Sweeten a quart of 
cream, and mix with it a tea-cujjful of white 
wine, and the grated peel of a lemon ; whisk 
it to a froth, which drain upon the back of a 
sieve, and put part into a deep glass dish; 
cut some Naples biscuit as thin as |x>?sible, 
and put a layer lightly over the froth, and 
one of red currant jelly, then a layer of the 
froth, and one of the biscuit and jelly; finish 
with the froth, and pour the remainder of the 
cream into the dish, and garnish with citron 
and candied orange-peel cut into straws. 

WHITE BEET, LEAVES. Pick and 
wash ilii'rn clean, put them on in lx>iling 
water with a little salt, cover the saucepan, 
and boil them longer than spinach; drain off 
the water, and beat them as spinach, with a 
bit of butter and a little salt. 

WHITINGS. In choosing whitings, be 
careful that the skin has a silvery appear- 
ance, that tlie body is firm, and the fins 
stiff; these are sure proofs of its fresh- 



WHITINGS, ENGLISH WAY. Put 
into a saucepan two spoonfuls of oil, half a 
lemon sliced (tlie pips and rind taken off), 
salt, and pepper, two glasses of white wine, 
the same of water, and let them boil nearly 
a quarter of an hour; then put the whitings, 
properly cleaned, cook them in the above,

WIDGEONS AND TEAL, Addressed 

exactlx as llie wild duck ; only that less time 
is requisite for a widgeon, and still less for 
a teal. 

WILD DUCKS. For roasting a wild 
duck, yon must have a clear, l>ri.-k fire, and 
a hot spit ; it must !* browned upon the out- 
side, without being sodden within. To have 
it well frothed and full of gravy is the nicety. 
Prepare the fire by stirring and raking it 
just U'lore the bird is laid down, and fifteen 
or twenty minutes will do it in the fashion- 
able wi\ ; Uit if you like it a little more 
done, allow it a few minutes longer; if it is 
too much, it will lose its, flavor. t

again on the lire, stirring constantly till the 
butter is melted. 

WINTER HOTCH-POTCH. Take 
the best end of a neck or loin of mutton; 
cut it into neat chops; cut four carrots, and 
as many turnips into slices; put on four 
quarts of water, with half the carrots and 
luriii|>s, and a whole one of each, with a 
[MMiml of' di ted green peas, which must be 
put to soak the night before; let it boil two

these birds, to handle them as little an pos- 
sible, on account of the skin being so par- 
ticularly tender, that wlien broken it spoilt*

WOODCOCKS. (2) Take a pound 
of lean beef, cut it into piece*, and put it

VEA 



into a saucepan, with two quarts of water, 
an onion stuck with clove.*, two blades of 
mace, and some whole pepper, boil all these 
together till reduced to half ; then strain it 
off into another saucepan: draw the wood- 
cocks, and lay the trail in a plate; put tlie 
woodcocks into the gravy, and let them boil 
in it for twelve minutes; while they are 
boiling, mince the trail and liver very small ; 
put them into a small saucepan, with a lit- 
tle mace; add four or five spoonfuls of the 
gravy tlie woodcocks are boiled in ; then 
take the crumb of a stale roll, rub it fine 
into a dish placed before the fire, and put to 
tlie trail, in the small saucepan, half a pint 
of red port, a bit of butter, rolled in finur, 
set it on the fire, and shake it round till the 
butler is melted ; tlien put in the bread- 
crumbs, and shake the saucepan round; lay 
the woodcocks in the dish, pour the sauce 
over them, and serve. 

WOODCOCKS. (3) Woodcocks should 
not be drawn, as the trail is by the lovers 
of " haul gout" considered a " bonne 
bouche;" truss their legs close to the body, 
and run an iron skewer through each thigh, 
close to the body, and tie them on a small 
bird spit; put them to roast at a clear fire; 
cut as many slices of bread as you have 
birds, toast or fry them a delicate brown, 
and lay them in the dripping-pan under the 
birds to catch the trail ; baste them with 
butter, and froth them with flour ; lay the 
toast on a hot dish, and the birds on the 
toa.st ; pour some good beef gravy into tlie 
dish, and send some up in a boat, twenty or 
thirty minutes will roast them. Garnish 
with slices of lemon. Some epicures like 
this bird very much under-done, and direct 
that a woodcock should be just introduced 
to the cook, for her to show it the fire, and 
then send it up to table. 

WOODCOCKS IN A MINUTE. Put 

a brace of woodcocks into a fryingpan, 
with some butler, shred shallots, grated 
nutmeg, salt, and pepper; set the pan on a 
fierce fire, and fry I he woodcocks lightly for 
seven or eight minutes; then add the juice 
of two lemons, half a glass of white wine, 
and some raspings ; and leave them on the 
fire till the sauce has boiled up once; then 
serve altogether. 

WOODCOCK SALMIS. Cut up the 
woodcock on the table, and put tlie pieces 
on a dish, which place on a stand, with a 
lamp under it; add pepper, salt, shred shal- 
lots, nearly a glass of white wine, the juice 
t of three lemons, and a bit of butter; strew 
Taspings over, and boil slowly for ten min- 
frtes, stirring occasionally. Use spirits of 
wine, for your lamp- 



WOODCOCK SAUCE. Pound the 
bones and livers of roasted woodcocks, and 
put them into a stewpan, with two spoon- 
fuls of cullis, and two spoonfuls of red port ; 
reduce it to the consistence of a sauce, and 
then strain it; when strained, add pepper, 
salt, and tlie juice of two oranges. 



Y. 

YEAST. Beer yeast, which is the best 
for bread, should be strained through a hair 
sieve, and two or three quarts of cold spring 
water poured over it; when it has stood for 
twenty-four hours the water should lie poured 
off, the yeast will then be found at the bottom 
of the vessel, quite thick. To preserve that 
which may be left over the baking, it should 
l>e put into a bottle, corked tightly, and kept 
in a cool place. In cold weather it will 
continue good for a fortnight, but fresh yeast 
is always preferable. When it does not ap- 
pear sufficiently strong, honey or brown sugar 
may l>c mixed with it, in the proportion of a 
tea-spoonful to half a pint. 

YEAST, BAKER'S. Boil two ounces 
of hops in four quarts of water one hour, 
adding more water as it decreases, carefully 
stirring it all the time, and taking care that 
it do not boil over; strain the liquor, and 
mix well with it two pounds of malt; cover 
it, and let it stand for eight hours, or until it 
be milk warm, then stir in half a pint of 
good yeast; when mixed well together, let 
it work for ten hours, and then strain it 
through a hair sieve. 

YEAST, BRAN. Boil for ten minutes, 
in two quarts of water, one pint of bran, and 
a small handful of good hops; strain it 
through a sieve, and when milk warm, add 
three or four table-spoonfuls of beer yeast, 
and two of brown sugar or treacle: put it 
into a wooden stoupor jug; cover it, and 
place it before the fire to ferment. It may 
be bottled, tightly corked, and kept in a cool 
place. 

YEAST DUMPLINGS. Make a very 
light dough with yeast, the same as for bread, 
but with milk instead of water, add salt; 
set it by the fire, covered up in a pan, for 
half an hour, or an hour, to rise ; in tlie mean 
lin.e, set on the fire a large saucepan of hot 
water, and as soon as it boils, roll up die 
dough into small balls, and put them into the 
boiling water; keep them continually boiling 
for ten minutes, tlien take them out, and serve 
them immediately, with wine sauce over 
them. To ascertain whether they are suffi- 



YEA

ZES 



ciently boiled, stick a fork into one, and if it 
cornea out clean, it is done enough. Some 
think the l<est manner of eating them is by 
dividing them from the top by two forks, as 
they become heavy by their own steam, and 
eat them immediately with meat, or sugar 
and butter, or salt. 

YELLOW GLAZE. Make a glaze, 
with a quarter of a pound of fine sugar in 

Cowder, the white of an egg, to which add 
y degrees as much lemon-juice as may be 
necessary; when sufficiently beaten up, (and 
the longer it is beaten the whiter it will be), 
add to it a small quantity of infusion of saf- 
fron, strained, and the yellow rind of one or 
two lemons grated on a piece of sugar, scrap- 
ed off and pounded; take care, however, 
not to put too much of the latter, lest the 
glaze should be hitter. 

YEAST, TO MAKE. Boil for half an 
hour two quarts of water, thickened with 
about three spoonfuls of fine flour, and 
sweetened with nearly half a pound of brown 
sugar; when almost cold, put it into a jug, 
adding' four spoonfuls of fresh yeas I ; shake 
it well together, let it stand uncovered near 
the fire for a day, to ferment. There will be 



a thin liquor on the top, pour this off; shake 
the remainder, and cork it up for use. To 
make a half peck loaf you should use a quar- 
ter of a pint of the above. 

YEAST, POTATO. Boil some good 
mealy potatoes ; peel and weigh them ; while 
hot, bruise them finely, and mix them quickly 
with boiling water, allowing one quart to 
each pound ; rub it through a hair sieve, 
then add honey or brown sugar in the pro- 
portion of one ounce to each quart of water ; 
boil it to the consistency of batter, and when 
nearly cold, add a large table-spoonful of 
good yeast to every quart of water ; cover it 
with a cloth to rise, and the following day it 
will be ready for use ; keep a bottle of it, 
which may be used instead of beer yeast for 
the next making, first pouring off the thin 
liquid that is on the top. It must be made 
with fresh beer yeast every two or three 
months. Double the quantity of this, as of 
beer yeast, is required to make bread 
light. ' 

ZESTS. Zest (a term of art, used by 
confectioners) is the peel of oranges, lemons, 
or citrons, cut from top to bottom, in small 
slips or zests, as thin as possible.

FOR MAKING ALL KINDS OF 



CONFECTIONERY. 



CONFECTIONERY 



ALM 

ALMONDS, BLOWN. Scald a few al- 
monds, and pound them to a! unit half as fine 
as for biscuits, beat them with lemon-juice, 
whites of egjjs anil powder-sugar; drop 
them on paper, about tin- size of almond*, 
and dry them in a stove or gentle oven. 

ALMONDS BLOWN ROYAL. 

Choose four ounce.-, of small thick almonds, 
and put them into an oven until they are 
.-lightly colored. Whilst I hey are cooling, 
mix four (Miners df sii^ar with an egg; 
U'ut them up fir ten minutes; add a little 
carmine to make it a fine rose color; dip i 
the almondii into this: take them out; dis- 
njjajM' (hem from the ?%%, so that tliey may 
he only just covered with it; lay them two I 
and two on a sheet of strong paper three- 
quarters of an inch between each pair; 
they may also lie placed in threes to form 
tlu> tre-foil, on w hich may be added a fourth. ; 
Bake Uiein in a cool oven. 

ALMOND BUTTER. To a quarter j 

of a |xiund of blanched almonds, well beat, '; 
put some new milk and rose water; take 
a quart of thick cream, and the yolks of 
twelve eggs beat well with a little of the 
cream ; ilien add the rest of the cream; put 
a quarter of a pint of new milk to the al- 
monds, and .-tiain them into the cream till , 
there is no strength left ; strain all togeth- 
er into a skillet, set it over a charcoal fire, 
and stir it till it cornea to a tender curd; 
put it into a strainer, and hang it up till the 
whey is drained out; then take six ounces 
of fine cificd sugar and a little rose water, 
and beat it all into butter with a spoon. 

ALMOND BITTER CAKE. Pound 
three ounce* (half bitter and half sweet) of 
almonds, put them into an earthen pan with 
six ounces of powder sugar; the same of 
sifted (lour, two whole eggs, and six yolks, 
a spoonful of brandy and a grain or two of 
pall ; work these up together for five min- 
ute* and then add six ounces of fresh but- 
ler which is .-lightly wanned, work that in 
for four minutes longer. Then, having 
whipped the whiles of two eggs, mix them 
into the paste. Butter a well-tinned copper 



ALM 

mould or paper case, ten inches long, five 
wide, and two high; pour in your prepara- 
tion, and bake it in a cool oven. While bak- 
ipg, whip the whites of two eggs, and mix 
two ounces of powder sugar with them, and 
cut four ounces of sweet almonds into slips 
(short wise;) mix them also with two ounce* 
of powder sugar and a spoonful of white of 
PJJ? whipped. In three-quarters of an hour 
take out the cake, and if it be firm and well 
colored, cover it with the whipped egg and 
sugar, and on that strew the almonds equal- 
ly, press ing them in, that all may be colored 
alike. This operation must be performed as 
quick as possible, and when done, turn the 
cake out and cut it in four slips (length- 
wise,) and then divide each into six parts 
lozenge-shaped ; this will give you twenty- 
four cakes, which must be arranged in stars 
on your dish, six to every star. They 
may also be cut in two lengths instead of 
four, and these divided into fifteen small 
pieces, and then, with a paste-cutter, form- 
ed into crescents. The ingredients, and the 
proper quantities for this cake are as follows: 
six ounces of flour, the same of powder 
sugar, three ounces of sweet and bitter al- 
monds, six yolks, and two whole eggs, six 
ounces of butter, two of sugar mixed with 
the w hites of two eggs whipped, four ounces 
of cut almonds added to the sugar and eggs, 
a spoonful of brandy and a grain of salt. 

ALMOND CANDY. Blanch a pound 
of the best almonds, and cut them very 
thin, lengthways, put them into a pound of 
clarified sugar to crisp them, stir them over 
the fire till boiled to souffle; then take 
them off and keep stirring till the sugar is 
dry like sand: then silt it, so that the al- 
monds may be left, divide them into four 
parts to color them differently, one part 
red, the second yellow, the third green, and 
the fourth left white as they come from the 
-u.-ar. To color the first, soak a small 
quantity of carmine in clarified sugar, and 
lay your almonds in it; do the same with a 
little tincture of saffron for the yellow, and 
spinach juice for the green. Place the col- 
ored almonds on a neve in a stove; when 
dry, mix all together, adding the white 



ALM

ALM 



ones. Boil nearly as much sugar as your 
mould will require to souffle, put it in, and 
when the almonds are quite dry, garnish the 
surface of the sugar with them; do not, 
however, lay them too thick, and just pi-ess 
them down with a fork; put the mould in- 
to a moderate oven for five hours, then drain 
it well, and in another two hours it may be 
taken from the mould. 

ALMONDS CINNAMON SPANISH. 

Blanch your almonds, then with a bit of 
butter tied in a piece of ctolli, rub the pan 
and brown them. Have ready some clari- 
fied sugar, with powdered cinnamon stirred 
in it, put in the almonds, and when well cov- 
ered with llie sugar and cinnamon, lay them 
separately on tins, and dry in a slow oven. 

ALMONDS TO COLOR. ALMONDS 
ROSE COLORED. Blanch and cut sweet 
almonds in small pieces, put them on a bak- 
ing plate, and pour on them a link- of any 
vegetable liquid, of an infusion of cochineal, 
or carmine; then rub them in your hands, 
to mix them well with the color; when all 
are so done, dry them in a stove or in die 
oven. 

ALMONDS VIOLET. Are done in the 
same way, the coloring ingredients are 
cochineal, and a little indigo dissolved in 
water, put but a small quantity of die latter 
at a time as it is very powerful. 

ALMONDS GREEN. The same pro- 
ceeding: die color is made with two hand- 
fills of fresh spinach, well washed, drained, 
and then pounded; when very fine, press it 
through a napkin ; let the juice drop on a 
dish, which place on a hot stove; as soon as 
it begins to boil, take it off, stirring it con- 
stantly, till the green curdles, then pour it 
through a horsehair sieve, and when well 
drained strain it through a silk sieve or tam- 
my; the juice thus obtained, will give the 
almonds (which must be put in a lew at a 
time) a clear and even green color. 

ALMONDS BLUE. Dissolve a little in- 
digo in water, strain it through a cloth and 
use it as above mentioned. 



ALMONDS ORANGE 

Mix a little liquid red, and a little infusion 
of saffron togedier, and proceed with die al- 
monds as usual. 

ALMONDS LEMON COLORED. 

Infuse a small quantity of saffron in nearly 
boiling water for a few minutes; strain and 
follow the above direction. 

ALMONDS CHOCOLATE COLOR- 



ED. Are dyed with chocolate dissolved in 
water and strained. 

The almonds may be cut in slips, dice, 
&c. according to fancy. Observe that die 
color of your almond's should be light and 
delicate; when done, place them, eidier 
separately or mixed together, iu papei 
cases. 

ALMOND COUPEAUX. Blanch and 
pound half a pound of sweet almonds with 
die whites of three eggs into a very fine 
paste, add to it six ounces of powdered su- 
gar and the rind of a lemon grated ; when 
thoroughly mixed togedier, pour over it 
about four spoonfuls of orange-flower water: 
stir up the paste (which ought to be rather 
thin,) once more, and then lay it with a 
spoon on a plate of bright copper, in an 
oval form, about three or four inches in 
length. The plate being quite full, take it 
up by Iwth hands, and strike it steadily upon 
a table, so that the paste may be extended, 
but not much ; then bake them until diey be- 
come of a deep yellow. Take them from 
the copper with a knife, and whilst hot put 
them on a wooden roller, about the diick- 
ness of an arm, and press them widi your 
hand, that they may acquire the form of die 
wood, and when cool place in a box, and 
keep them dry. These coupeaux are very 
brittle.

them on the fire, and let them remain; when 
the almonds crackle lake them off and work 
them about until the sugar is detached from 
the almonds, then take away part of the su- 
gar, put the almonds on the fire again, and 
stir them lightly with a spatula, (be careful 
that the fire be not too quick;) and when 
diey have taken the sugar, add that which 
had been removed, and continue to burn 
them till they have unbilled that also. Place 
a sheet of paper on a sieve, throw your al- 
monds on it, separate those which adhere 
together, and let them cool. 

ALMOND DRAGEES. Take of the 
best and largest almonds what quantity you 
please, and having washed them in cold wa- 
ter, let them drain and dry on a sieve for 
twenty-four hours. Tin; next day weigh 
them, and for each pound of almonds lake 
diree pounds of sugar; clarifv the latter and 
boil it to the degree petit lissc; then let it 
cool a little. Hau; \onr tossing pan ready;

shake them again, that the Hour may adliere 
all round the almond*. After this, swing 
the pan backwards and forwards, liy which

die blade of a knife spread it equally over 
the surface for about the eighth of an inch, 
and then let them stand for hall' an hour 
before von put them into the oven, which 
must !* moderate. If you bake them imme- 
diately after putting on the glaze, it wrinkles 
and shrivels up, which spoils their appear- 
ance, as they ought to be quite smooth and 
even ; the cakes also require considerable 
care in the baking ; they should be slightly 
colored on the top and the lower part red- 
dish.

ami a half of water, keep them on the tire, 
stirring (hem continually, until they crackle 
and fly about, and the sugar Ix-gins to color, 
stir them alxuit gently to gather the 
and leave them in the pan to dry about two 
hours, in a stove or any moderate heat. 

ALMONDS, RED CRISPED. Pre- 
pare tliem as alxive until they have taken 
the sugar and are ready to be taken off' the 
fire, put tlie almonds ujwn a sieve with a 
dish under, take the sugar that drops, and 
put it into the same pan, adding a little 
fresh ; refine it till it comes to the twelfth 
degree au caste, then take cochineal, color 
sufficient to tin,-.- the almonds, and put them 
therein ; give them a few turns over the (ire 
jar, ar.it finish as at lir.-t.

meat.- are taken from the stove or oven, wash 
them over w ith a light brush dipped in the 
sirup; this will give them a delicious per- 
fume, and they may then be called it la 
glace. When cohi, take tliem from tlie 
(Kiper and put them into glasses for the table. 

ALMONDS, ROCK OF ALICAN- 
TE, SPANISH. Clarify honey, and 
stir into it as many blanched almonds as 
you can entangle. Leave it to cool. This

spread the paste on wafer pa|x-r with the 
blade of a Knife (tlie wafer paper must be 
rubbed with virgin wax and sweet oil) ; lay 
tlie pi eviration on as thin as possible ; chop 
some sweet almonds very small, mix them 
with sugar, and strew them over the wafers 
and [Hit them into a hot oven ; when about 
half baked, take them out and cut them in 
squares ; replace them a minute in the oven, 
take them out again, and- press Ihem on a 
stick to give them tlie proper form 1 ; as soon 
a- they are cold, put them on a sievo. Just 
liefore they are served they should be Slightly 
wanned. 

ALMOND COMPOTE, GRF'.V.N. 

Take the peel very carefully from you r al- 
monds, and put them with water on tlie >'irc. 
till they are tender ; then take them o(Ta*nd 
add a little more water ; when nearly co Id 
put tliem on tlie fire again, but do not lei* 
them boil ; as soon as you find the head of 
a pin will penetrate easily, they are then 
sufficiently done, and may be thrown into 
cold water; and when tlie fruit is quite cold, 
drain them. In the meantime put some 
clarified sugar on the fire, and when it boils 
put in tlie almonds ; boil them in the sugar 
about twenty times, then remove them, and 
let the almonds stand to take the sugar : in 
about two hours' lime put them on tlie fire 
again, and Ixjil tliem up a dozen times ; after 
which, take them oft, skim, and let. them 
cool. When quite cool drain and put the 
fruit in a compotier. If tlie sugar should 
not he sufficiently done, boil as much more 
a- \oii may think necessary ; squeeze in tlie 
juice of an orange, Ixiil it once again, and 
when nearly cold strain it through a cloth 
into the compotier over tlie almond*. 

ALMOND NONPAREILS, GREEN. 

Drain some green almonds that have been

preserved in brandy ; dip them one by one 
in sugar prepared an casse, and roll them 
in white, or any other colored nonpareils, 
and dry them in a stove, or gentle oven. 

ALMOND (GREEN) PRESERVED. 
Put some water into a saurepan, with two 
liandfuls of bran, and when it has lx>!led up 
twice, throw in some green almonds ; let 
1 them boil up once, then !;ike them out with 
a skimmer, an 1 rub them well in your han.ls 
to take off the down ; as you do this, throw 
them into cold water ; then boil them in 
water till, on pricking them, a pin easily 
enters and they shrink : then clarify some 
svigar, a pound to a pound of fruit ; boil up 
the sirup fjur or five successive days, morn- 
ing and evening, without the fruit, which 
you leave to drain upon a sieve ; lastly, put 
the fruit into a pan, and when rather more 
than lukewarm, pour the sirup over it ; when 
they look very green they are sufficiently 
done. 

ANDAYE BRANDY. An ounce of 
bruised aniseed, an ounce of bruised corian- 
der seed, two ounces of powdered Florence 
iris, the j'.estes of two oranges ; put them 
with thref quarts of dislillc I brandy into the 
alembic bain-marie ; dissolve two poun Is 
and a lialf of sn^ar in two pints and a half 
of clear river water, ad I them to the distilled 
liquejur, pass the whole through a strainer, 
and put into buttles. 

VGELTCA CAKES. Take four oun- 
octs of angelica powder, and two pounds of 
fi/ne sugar. Beat up the white of an egg 
MI i th a little sifted sugar, until it is of the con- 
/sistence of cream cheese ; dissolve the sujjar 
/ in a skillet and skim it ; when it has boiled 
a little, throw in the angelica, and boil the 
sugar to petit cassf, then take it from the 
fire, put in half a spoonful of the twaten e:jg, 
and stir it quickly until the sugar i ises, then 
stop, and when it has fallen again, stir till 
it rises a seron,) time ; it may now be pour- 
ed into moulds or papet cases, well oiled and 
sprinkled with sifted sugar. 

ANGELICA (ESSENCE OF) JELLY. 
Having washed and well dried two ounces of 
angelica-roots ; cut them in pieces and throw 
them into boiling sirup, (three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar,) with an ounce of bruised 
angelica seeds ; cover the mixture close, and 
when cold, add to it half a glass of kirsch- 
laasser, and pass it through a tammy; then 
filter, and afterwards put to it an ounce of 
isinglass : stir it lightly with a silver spoon; 
pound ten pounds of ice, and put it into a 
large sieve or pan, place your mould in the 
middle of the ice, taking care that it touches 
the ice in every part ; pour the jelly into the 



mould, cover it with a saucepan lid, put ice 
on that, and let it stand for three hours ; after 
that time have ready a saucepan large enough 
to take in the moult easily ; fill it with water 
so warm that you can scarcely bear your hand 
in it ; plunge the mould in so as to allow the 
water to pass over the whole, but as quickly 
as possible, anil then turn the jelly into your 
dish for table. This last operation should 
be performed with great agility. Observe, 
in making these kind of jellies, that no tinned 
or pewter vessels or spoons should be used, 
as they impart a violet tinge to your jellies, 
which ought to be of the color of the ingre- 
dients employed, as for instance the, above 
should be a clear light green color. 

ANGELICA LIQUEUR. Wash, 
scrape, and cut in small pieces, twelve ounces 
of fresh, or half the quantity of Bohemian 
angelica roots, and infuse them for a week 
in six pints of brand v and one of water, with 
a drachm of mace, two drachms of cinnamon, 
and twelve cloves ; at the end of that time 
distil it, then dissohe three pounds of sugar 
in three pints of water ; mix it with the 
liqueur, strain it through a jelly-bag, or fil- 
ter it through paper. Observe, that the best 
brandy lor liriuiurs is that which is made 
at Montpelier, EU it yields more in distilla- 
tion than the Cogniac. Take notice also 
that the first drops which Till from the alem- 
bic after it is placed on the stove, must not 
be mixed with the liqueur. A glass should, 
therefore, lie placed under the mouth of the 
alembic to receive them, and when about a 
quarter of it is filled you may remove it, and 
place your bottles or matrass. The phlegm, 
as these droppings are culled, are good for 
nothing. 

ANGELICA PASTE. Take young and 
pithy angelica stalks, boil them till tender, 
drain and press all the water out ; beat them 
in a mortar to a paste, and rub it through a 
sieve. Next day dry it over the lire, and to 
every pound of paste put a pound of powder- 
sugar. When the |>aste is hot add the sugar, 
stirring it till thoroughly mixed, over a gentle 
fire. Drop it on plates, ilnst a little sugar 
over them, and dry them in a stove. 

ANGELICA PRESERVED. Take the 
stalks of angelica when of a good size, but 
before they have run to seed ; clear off the 
leaves, and as you cut (he stalks into proper 
lengths throw them into water, and boil them 
till the stalks are soft; take them from the 
fire, and put them into cold water ; take off" 
the skin, and again put them into 'cold water; 
then drain and put them into an earthen pan, 
and pour over a sufficient quantity of clarified 
sugar to float the angelica. In twenty-four 
hours boil the sugar ten or a dozen times,

and when lukewarm pour it over tlie stalks. 
Proceed in the same way for four succeeding 
dajs ; alter wliidi, drain tlif stalks, and in 
tlie meanwhile boil the sugar (adding more, 
if necessary ) to the degree grande perlt ; 
put tlie angelica to this, cover it close, and 
let it boil five or six times. Take it from 
tile lire, scum, and put it by in pots. 

ANGELICA PRESERVED DRY. 

Proceed as for the liquid, until you have 
jxjnred (lie sujjar aw grand perlt, over the 
angelica ; leave it for a day in tlie sugar, 
then drain and dry it on slates, or iron plalcs, 
in a stove. -

well in, and then put in two more eggs and 
the ztste of a lemon minced fine : when 
ihese are also well incorporated, add another 
egg or two, if tlie puste (which should lie ra- 
her firm,) will bear them. Sprinkle your 
r.iste slab with flour, cut the paste into 
lieees, each the size of a walnut; roll these 
with as little flour as possible, to about three 
incites long, and as you roll them plnce them 
on a baking-tin, two inches apart; dorez 
and bake them in a tolerably warm oven till 
they are firm. Then cut some anise into 
fillets, boil a quarter of a pound of sugar to 
casse, and the moment it re-aches (hat de- 
gree set it by the side of the fire that the 
sugar may not lose its whiteness; dip the 
top and one side of each petit pain in the

put a pint of water into the alembic; take 
care to collect the phlegm Ix-l'.re you draw 
oft'lhe aniseed water. Dissolve three pounds 
of sugar in three pints of water. As the 
anise contains an acid salt, which render* 
this liqueur milky, the following proceeding 
is necessary: Reserve a pint of the water 
from that in which you dissolved the sugar, 
and mix with the white of three or four 
eggs, well whippet], and while the sirup's 
hot put to it this egg-water and the aniseed 
water; stir it over the fire until the whole

BISCUITS, LARGE SAVOY. Take 

fifly-six eggs, four pounds of sugar, the zes- 
tes of four oranges, a pound and three-quar- 
ters of potatoe-flour sifted ; and make your 
biscuit as follows: grate the zestes of the 
oranges on a piece of sugar, and as soon as 
it becomes colored, scrape it off, and grate 
again until all the zeste is done, then dry 
die sugar perfectly, crush and sift it.

that all are perfectly fresh ;) put the yolks 
and whites into separate vessels; mix half 
your sugar with the former, stirring it in 
with a spatula until perfectly smooth, then 
add the remainder, and work it well for 
twenty minutes. Whip the whites till quite

the whisk is taken out; mix a little wilh 
the yolks; still, however, keeping the whites 
stirring; then pour the yolks on them very 
gently mixing them together as you pour, 
with the whisk: sift over the whole a pound 
of potatoe-flour, stirring the mixture all the 
time; when ready to put into the mould, 
your paste should be very smooth, and some- 
what of the consistence of treacle. Butter 
Ule mould, and put in a few spoonfuls of 
your paste at first, to prevent any globules 
of air appearing on the top when baked; 
pour in the remainder carefully. Cover a 
baking-plate with hot ashes, lay the mould 
in the midst of them, and place it in a mod- 
erate oven ; keep it open for an hour, that 
the biscuit mav be watched, and if it takes 
color too quickly, cover it with paper. In 
diree hours time take il from the oven, and 
if it be of a good color, uml linn, turn it on 
a baking-tin, tie round it a band of double 
paper, and replace it in the oven for a quar- 
ter of an hour to dry. 

IBID, WITH ALMONDS. The in- 
gredients for this biscuit are the same as 
above, with the addition of four eggs, and

ter; make the above ingredients into a paste 
with this, and roll it to the size of a large 
rolling-pin ; lay it on a sheet of paper, flat 
it down a little wilh your hand, keeping it

ture into well-buttered tin moulds, sift sugar 
over, and bake them in a moderate oven. 
Take them from the tins while hot. 

BISCUITS, SPOON. Break four eggs, 
put the yolks and whites into separate 
basins; add to the former a quarter of a

whip the whites to a froth, and put about 
half of them to the yolks, and when that is 
well mixed in, add the rest; stir it very 
lightly, and lay them with a spoon on paper, 
make them about three inches long, and the 
breadth of a finger. Glaze them with pow- 
der-sugar, and place them on baking tins, 
add, as the sugar dissolves, and they .-hine, 
put the biscuits into a moderate oven, which 
must be kept open for seven or eight minutes 
then close it until your biscuits are of a pro-

wards, till wanted 

BISCUITS, SWEET. Take half a 
pound of fine pounded sn^ar, and sift it 
through a tammy. Put the whites of twelve 
eggs into a preserving-pan, and the yolks

yolks and sugar; stir them gently; place 
your pan over a chafing-dish; continue 
whipping the whole for a full half hour, and 
then, if the drop which falls from the whisk 
lays a little while without spreading, take it 
from the fire, and whisk again till it is cold; 
then add half a pound of tine sifted flour, stir 
it in gently with a wooden sp ion. Drop 
them on paper, sift sugar OM-I-, and bake

lay the rings on them; wet them also as 
you lay them down, cpi inkle them lightly 
with po'.vdur sugar, ami liuke them in a 
liriik <r.eii. These bouchees require great 
attention in baking, as the sugar is apt to 
dissolve and color too quickly ; when done, 
they should be of a reddish tinge. Fill 
them with swealmeats, | -reserves, or whip- 
ped cream, according to fancy. 

BOUCHEES DE MONSIEUR. Pound

so that they can receive no heat from below, 
then put a stove with hot coals on the top 
of the oven, and let them remain in this 
state for twenty-lour hours; then put them 
for fifteen or twenty minutes into a mode- 
rate oven. Take them from the plates 
whilst hut, and as soon as cold, finish them 
in the same way as bouchees de dames; 
glaze them with chocolate, a la rose, with 
pistachios, orange, cedrat, he. &o. They 
may also be masked with sugar, pistachios, 
currants, &c. 

BOUCHEES PETITES, MERIN-

pieces round the edge of the bouchees like 
a crown; and each piece of the pistachios 
being placed on ilia cut side, they stand out 
from the edge of the bouchee: this process 
being finished, put them in tlie oven again a 
few minutes, to color the egg; and in the 
meantime stir up the white of egg which 
remains, and make with it half as many 
meringuees as you have bouchf.es, sprin- 
kle them witlt sugar, and r..lor lx>:li sides

inch apart, sprinkle them lightly with sugar, 
and dry tlie egg in the oven, taking cate 
they do not lose their whiteness. 

When cold, place between each pearl a 
smViler one of red-currant jelly. Fill your 
bouchees with apricot marmalade, apple-

it is dissipated during the preparation of 
the sirup. To preserve then the odour of 
the capillaire, when your sirup is sufficient- 
ly done, pour it, whilst boiling, upon some 
fresh capillaire coarsely chopped up; then 
cover your vessel, and let it stand until it 
is quite cold, then pass it through a bolting- 
cloth to separate it from the leaves of tlie 
capillaire. 

Take one ounce of the capillaire from 
Canada; put it into a glazed pan, pour upon 
it four pints of boiling water, leave it to in- 
fuse for twelve hours over some warm ashes ; 
strain it and let it run into a vessel, it will 
give you a strong tincture of cupillaire; 
melt in this tincture four pounds of sugar, 
put the whole into a preserving-pan, and 
put it on the fire, and clarify it with the 
white of an egg, continue the cooking ; when 
your sirup is perle, put some fresh capil- 
laire, chopped, into a pan, and pour your 
sirup, whilst boiling, upon it; cover your 
pan carefully, and let it cool; when your 
sirup is cold, you may flavor it if you please. 
Put it into bottles, and cork them hermeti- 
cally. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OF. (2) Take 
some good capillaire, chop it up, not very 
small, put it upon a sieve; pour upon it 
some boiling water, and then let it infuse 
for ten hours in a vessel well covered ; strain 
this infusion, and put into it some sugar 
boiled tt casse; clarify this sirup with the 
whites of eggs whipped; skim it till it is 
very clear ; when it rises, take it off the 
fire, and leave it to cool, then put it into 
bottles. 

Viard and Beauvilliers, whose receipts 
are nearly the same, boil their capillaire for 
a quarter of an hour in river- water; after 
having passed this boiling through a sieve, 
they put int6 it some powder-sugar, and 
clarify their sirup with water, or a whole 
egg beaten up; then skim it, and when it is 
very clear and has boiled an lisse, they 
take it off the fire, and put into it some 
orange-flower water, and strain it through 
a napkin or straining-bag, leaving it to 
cool before putting it into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sirup, you 
must use two good ounces of capillaire, four 
pints of water, and four pounds of sugar, 
powder-sugar is the best, as it prevents sir- 
ups from candying. 

CARAMEL. Break into a small copper 
or brass pan one pound of refined sugar ; 
put in a gill of spring-water ; set it on a 
fire; when it boils skim it quite clean, and 
let it boil quick, till it comes to the degree 
called crack; which may be known by dip- 
ping a tea-spoon or skewer into the sugar, 
and letting it drop to the bottom of a pan 



of cold water; and if it remains hard, it has 
attained that degree : squeeze in the juice 
of half a lemon, and let it remain one min- 
ute longer on the fire; then set the pan into 
another of cold water : have ready moulds 
of any shape; rub them over with sweet 
oil ; dip a spoon or fork into the sugar, and 
throw it over the mould in fine threads, till 
it is quite covered: make a small handle of 
caramel, or stick on two or three small gum 
paste rings, by way of ornament, and place 
it over small pastry of any description. 

CARAMEL CONSERVE. Clarify the 
quantity of sugar you may require, and boil 
f. to caramel; have ready some cases of 
double paper; pour in your sugar to the 
thickness of half an inch, and trace on its 
surface the forms you wish it to have ; when 
cold, break it according to those marks. 
This conserve may be colored and flavored 
according to the fancy. 

CARAMEL COVER FOR SWEET- 
MEATS. DissoUe eight ounces of double- 
refined sugar in three or four spoonfuls of 
water, and three or four drops of lemon- 
juice; then put it into a copper untinned 
skillet; when it boils to be thick, dip the 
handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a 
pint basin of water, squeeze the sugar from 
the spoon into it, and so on till you have all 
the sugar. Take a bit out of the water, 
and if it snaps and is brittle when cold, it is 
done enough ; but only let it be three parts 
cold, then pour the water from the sugar, 
and having a copper mould oiled well, run 
the sugar on it, in the manner of a maze, 
and when cold you may put it on the dish it 
is to cover ; but if, on trial, the sugar is not 
brittle, pour off the water, and return it in- 
to the skillet, and boil it again. It should 
look thick like treacle, but of a bright light 
gold color. It makes a most elegant cover. 

CARDAMUM COMFITS. Procure 
your cardamums at the chemists, and they 
will be in a shell; put them into the oven to 
dry the skins, and they will break; pick all 
the seeds from them, put the seeds into a 
large' comfit-pan, and have a fire under the 
same as for others; mix your gum, starch, 
and sirup, and finish them the same as cara- 
way comfits. 

CARAWAY CAKE. Dry a quarter 
of a peck of fine flour in an oven; rub a 
pound and a half of fresh butter in it, till it 
is crumbled so small that none of it is to be 
seen ; then take six spoonfuls of rose water, 
half a pint of canary, half a pint of cream, 
and three-quarters of a pint of new ale yeast, 
an I hi' whites of two, and yolks of four 
eggs; mix all these well together, let it lie

you can meet with, and take of them double 
the weight of the sugar you intend to use ; 



stone and tail ; and then put them on a 
gentle fire, and keep stirring them till re-

and bottle it ; cork it carefully. 

CHERRIES, SIRUP OF. The l>est 
cherries f<r this purpose are the black sour 
ones; take out the stones and express the 
juice into an earthen pan, where it must

late in a small quantity of claritied sugar; 
boil a pound of sugar to the premiere 
plume, put your chocolate into it, stirring 

\ ..'":. '. 

it well to mix it; serve it whilst it is warm. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. Take one 
pound ami a half of chocolate, put it on a 
pewter sheet or plate, and put it in the 
oven just to warm the chocolate ; then put 
it into a copper stru pan, witli three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar ; 
mix it well over the fire, take it off, and 
roll it in pieces the size of s.uall m.irbles, 
put them on white paper, an, I when they 
are all on, take the slieet of paper by euch 
corner, and lift it up and down so that the 
paper may touch the table earh time, and 
by that means you will see the drops come 
quite fat, about the size of a sixpence ; put 
some stig.tr nonpareils over them, and c.iv< r 
all that are on the paper, lliL-n tli.ike them 
off, and you will see all the chocolate droju 



are covered with the sugar nonpareils; let 
them stand till cold, and they will come off 
well, and then put them in a box paj>ered. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (IX 

Take any quantity of chocolate, melt it over 
the fire in a small pan; uheu melted pour 
it into that in which you are to make your 
cream; break your yolks of eggs into it, 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add some 
pounded loaf sugar to it, keep stirring con- 
tinually; then add your cream by little and 
little, stirring and turning it till the whole 
is mixed properly together; then set your 
pan over the fire, and keep stirring with a 
wooden spoon till you see your composition 
is near boiling, then take it off immediate- 
ly, for, from the moment you set your com- 
position over the *ire 'ill that it offers to 
boil, it has MiHicient time to incorporate 
well and thicken sufficiently, without need 
of boiling; and should you let it boil, you 
would risk the turning your cream into 
whey, on account of the yolks of eggs, which 
would do too much. Take great care 
likewise your cream is fresh and sweet, 
for otherwise as soon as it is warm it will 
turn to curds and whey; therefore, be care- 
ful, stir it Continually, from the time you 
set it on the fire till you take it off; then 
put it in the sabotiere to make it congeal 
after the usual manner. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (2) 

Dissolve the chocolate in a little water on 
a slow fire; when properly done, mix it 
with a pint of cream, three yolks of new 
laid eggs, and about half a pound of sugar. 

CHOCOLATE ICE WATER. Take 
three ounces of chocolate, warm it, and 
mix with it half a gill of sirup, and half a 
pint of water; mix it well, and freeze it 
thick. 

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS. Put 

a quarter of a pound of chocolate on a tin- 
plate over a coal fire, and when it is dis- 
solved pour it on a plate; put to it a sjxx/n- 
ful or two of sweet almond paste, m.ide as 
for macaroons, stir it in well, and then pour 
it upon the remainder of die alm.md paste, 
in which you have mixed a tea-s|x>onful of 
powdered cinnamon or v.mill.i, or both: 
beat them together well in a mnrtar, lay 
them on ptiper, and bake them for three- 
quarters of an hour in a moderate men. 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT AMOUR. 
For four bottles of brandy, take one pound 
of the best chocolate, cut in small bits; a 
little salt, two cloves, and a little cinna- 
mon; you must infuse all in the brandy, with 
two biitlles and half a pint of water, xvidi

whites of eggs, and filler it through the pa- 
per. You inn-i lie careful not to lake more 
than two bottles from every four, except 
from the cinnamon, from which \ou are to 
take as much as \<>u can get. 

CHOCOLATE PASTILS. Take a 
little chocolate, which put in a pan over the 
fire to melt it ; stir it with a spoon ; w hen 
it is melted, take half a pound of loaf su- 
gar, pounded in a mortar and silted, which 
dissolve in a little clear water. When that 
is done, put in \onr chocolate; if you find 
the paste too thick, add a little water, 
enough to bring it to that degree of liquidity 
(ha! \ .ii may take it up on a knife; then 
take half a sheet of pa|Mr, and cover it with 
little round and flat drops, which we call 
pastils, of the si/.e of a sixj>ence; let them 
dry naturally in a cupljoard; and when dry, 
take (hem oil' fiom the paper, and put them

CHOCOLATE PASTIL PASTE. 
Melt half an ounce of gum-dragon in a little 
water till it is quite dissolved and thick ; 
sift it through a linen cloth, jx.und it in a 
mortar with a quarter-part of whites of 

< hocolatc cake bruised, and half a 
pound of fine jxiwder-siigar, mixed by de- 

.1 adding either more or less sugar, 
according a~ die paste is malleable; it must 
be pretty firm; firm it into what flowers or 

- .11 please, as shells, lozenges, any 
kind of corn or hean., &c. 

CHOCOLATE PETIT PAINS. These 

are made ia the same way as 1'etits Pains 
a la Duchtxse (see that article), but with- 
out the dorure. When cold fill them with 
a cream patissiere, mixed with two ounces 
of vanilla chocolate, and sweetened with 
sugar, flavored with vanilla; tlwn put three 
! sugar, the same of choco- 
late, ami half tin- white of an egg into a 
pan; stir these ingredients with a silver 
spoon until you have a smooth transpaient 
glaze, with which mask the top and sides 
of the petit* pains, spreading it equally 
with the blade, of a knife. 

CHOCOLATE SWEETMEATS. 

Take two ounces of chocolate, and break it 
into a little warm water, put it on the fire, 
mid when quite dissolved, mix it with a 
|x inn. 1 of inarch|iane paste, to which may lie 
added vanilla or cinnamon; stir it up well, 
and then spread it on wafer-|Ki|irr in what 
f.n:i- vou please, and bake them in a mod- 
erate o\.-n. If (he :.we tmeats be not snlh- 
ciently dark colored, add a little bnl-ammo- 
niac. 

CINNAMON CAKES. WbUk up 



half a dozen eggs with three table-spoonfuls 
of rose water; add to it a pound of sifted 
sugar, a dessert-spoonful of powdered cinna- 
mon, and a sufficient quantity of flour to 
make it into a paste; roll it on* thin, and 
cut it into whatever forms your fancy may 
dictate, place (hem on paper, and bake 
them. When done, remove them from the 
pa|>er. Keep them dry. 

CINNAMON' CANDIED. (1) Soak cin- 
namon in water for four and twentv hours, 
and then cut it into pieces alxmt an inch 
long ; prepare some sugar to grand lissf, 
und give the cinnamon a Ixiil in it; drain 
and dry it in a stove to the pro|>er consis- 
tence ; then put it in the moulds with sugar 
Ixiiled to sovffli, and when half cold, dry 
it. Before the candy is removed from the 
moulds, they should In- laid on one side for 
some time. Keep them in paper in a dry 



CINNAMON CANDIED. (2) Cut 
some cinnamon into small sticks of alxiut an 
inch or an inch and a half long; then put 
them into thin sugar, and boil ihem as it 
were in a sirup. Then take ofT the pan, 
and set it by for five or six hours to soak, 
lake them out and lay them on a wire-grate, 
dry them thoroughly in the stove; after- 
wards |nit them in order in tin moulds 
upon little grates made for the purpose, and 
set into the moulds, so that there may be 
three rows set one alxive another, se|>arated 
by those grates. In the meantime, ln.il sii- 
. .1 till it is blown, and pour it into your 
mould, so that some of it may lie ii|xjn the 
uppermost grate; then set them in the sine 
with a covered fire, and let them stand all 
night ; the next morning take notice whether 
llie cinnamon IN; well coagulated; turn the 
mould upside down, and set it in the stove 
again, w iih a plate underneath; and when it 
is thoroughly drained, take out your slicks 
of cinnamon, loosening them, by little and 
little, gently ; then lay them upon a sieve, 
set in the stove, and dry them thoroughly. 

CINNAMON, CONSERVE OF. 

Bruise four drachms of cinnamon, dilute it 
with a little clarified sugar, or sirup of mal- 
lows; boil two pounds of sugar to pttit 
castt, throw in the cinnamon, slir it well, 
and tlien take it from the fire, and when the 
sugar begins to whiten, pour tlie conserve 
into cases or moulds, and dry it as usual. 

'CINNAMON, DRAGEES OR SU- 
GARED. Soak a quarter of a pound of 
the best cinnamon in wicks, for twelve houra 
in w atcr to soften it ; at the end of that lime, 
cut it into slips, lay them on a sieve in a 
warm place for some days. Wlien quite

hard and dry, boil some fine sugar to the 
degree grand perle; have ready a quantity 
of fine powder, and proceed in the same 
manner aa in doing Almond Dragees, 
until the cinnamon sticks are of the proper 
thickness; those which are to be twisted or 
curled, shoul I not l>e so thick as the others. 
Be equally particolar in removing the sugar, 
that cakes on the bottom of the pan, as in 
making Almond Dragees. 

CINNAMON DRAGEES, COMMON. 
Infuse a quarter of a pound of gum-dragon, 
in a< i!i:ic:h water ;is will cover it; the next 
day put the infusion into a mortar, and stir 
it well with a pestle, and the longer it is 
stirred the whiter it becomes; in rathor 
more than a quarter of r.n hour, add to it 
the caked si'gar which was remo\ed from 
the preserving-pan, and which must be well 
pounded and sifted, also a pound of powder- 
sugar, :\ S[X>oHiil of cinnamon powder, and, 
by degrees two or three pounds of flow; 
OOKten the whole occasionally wild water; 
when the paste is of a proper consistence, 
place it on the slab or pasteboard, knead it 
well for a short time, roll it out in sheets, 
not thicker than the eighth of an inch, und 
then cut it into slips of the same size as the 
cinnamon (see above,) put them on paper 
or a sieve in a warm place for some days. 
Then buil some common sugar to perle, 
nnd sugar the slips of paste as above direct- 
ed; instead of the fine powder, flour is su!li- 
cient, until the last two layers, when the 
powder may be used to give them whiteness. 
When of the requisite size, lay them on 
sieves to dry. In a few days there may l>e 
curled, and colored, which is done in the 
same manner as coriander seeds. Observe, 
fine sugared cinnamon i.j always white. 

CINNAMON, ESSENCE OF. This 
is mado by infusing oil of cinnamon in 
highly rectified spirits of wine, in the pro- 
portion of half a drachm of the former to an 
ounce of the latter. 

CINNAMON PASTILS. Dissolve 
half an ounce of gum-dragon in a glass of 
water, and strain it through a lawn sieve 
into a mortar, and add to it a tea-spoonful 
of powdered cinnamon, and a sufficient 
quantity of sifted sugar to make the paste of 
a proper consistence; form into such figures 
as you may fancy, and dry them in a stove. 
Keep them in a dry place. 

CINNAMON SWEETMEATS. Take 
a pound of marchpane (taste, and dilute 
it with as many whites of eggs as will 
make it spread easily with a knife; add to 
this, a spoonful or two of prepared bolt-am- 
moniac, which will give it a fine reJ tinge, 



and half an ounce of cinnamon-powder. 
When all these ingredients are well mixed, 
cut some wafer-paper into such forms as you 
may think proper, and lay on them the paste 
alxntt the thickness of the eighth of an inch ; 
place them on paper, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. Wlien done, they may be 
finished in the following manner: Boil 
some sugar in orange-flower water, to la 
plume, and as von take the sweetmeats from 
the oven; dip a h.tir-penril into the sirup, 
and brush thorn over; this dries almost im- 
mediately, and considerably improves the 
look of them. 

CINNAMON WAFERS. Pound and 
sift six ounces of sugar, and put it with an 
equal quantity of melied fresh butter, the 
same of flour, half an ounce of powdered 
cinnamon, and a small egg; stirthc.-e up in 
an eartheiman- v.-sel, with a sufficient 
quantity of milk to make it into a thin, but 
not too clear, jiaste. Make an iron plate 
quite hot, rub it well with butter, then lay 
on it a spoonful of il:o p.iste; fry it, and 
when brown on both sides, roll it, still over 
the hot iron, round a small stick; do this 
until all the paste is ii.-ed. 

CINNAMONUM. Take a quarter of 
a pound of cinnamon, two drachms of mace, 
and one ounce of stick-liquorice; bruise 
heiii well, and then put them into three 
quarts of t!ic he.-t I. randy; let the iut'ision 
stand fur sume da\s l-et">re you distil it; 
dissolve four poun Is i.f sugar III tluee pints 
J'.nd a ha'.f of water; mix this sirup wilh the 
liqueur, and then strain them. This is 
sometimes called Oil of Cinnamon. 

CITRON, CANDIED. Pare the citrons 
very thin and narrow, and throw them into 
water; these are called faggots; then cut 
the citron imo slices of any thickness yon 
think proper; takeout the inner part with 
great care, so as to leave only the white 
ring, an I put them with the faggots into 
boiling water; when tender, drain them. 
Boil a sufficient quantity uf clarified sugar 
to souffle; then put in the rings, and boil 
them ti;g(her. Take it from the fire, and 
when a little cool, rub the sugar against the 
side of the pre erving-pan with the back of 
a spoon; as soon ;is it becomes while, take 
out the rings with a fork very carefully, one 
by one, and lay them on a wire-grate to 
drain: boil and proceed with the faggots in 
a similar way; when taken out, cut them 
into proper lengths with a pair of scissors, 
and lay them also on the wire to drain. 

CITRON PASTE. Cut off the ends 
of the citrons, take out the middle, with all 
the seeds; boil them in some water; and

when quite fender, tal-:e thorn from the firr, 
and ilirnw tlioin info mid water a moment; 
then, having pressed them in a cloth to get 
the water out, pound and sifl them. To 
e\ery quarter itf a |xuind of this marmalade 
put half a |K)iiiid of clarified sii^ir; simmer 
them together, .-lining constantly imlil well 
mixed ; ilHMi|)iit them inlo moulds, and place 
them in a st .\u to dry. 

CITRON WHITE PRESERVED. 

Lay some white citrons, cut into pieces, in 
salt and water for four or five hours; then, 
having washed them in cold water, boil 
Ui em ; when ten ier, drain, and lay ihern 
into as much clarified siv;ar ,i< wilf cover 
them. The next day drain off the simp, 
and boil it; when <|>iire smooth and col:l, 
pour it on the citrons: let them stand twen- 
ty-four hours; then I nil the sirup again, 
and pi:t in the citrons. The third day, 
Kiil Iwth t. Aether, and put them into moulds 
to candv . 

CITRON J'RKSF.UVKJ) LIQUID. 
Cut a slit in the sides of some small citrons, 
so that the inside may lake the sugar as 
well .1- the oiil.-ide, and put them over tin- 
fire in some water; whenever lliey are near 
boiling, put coli) v. ater to them. As soon 
as tin- citrons rie to the top, take them oul, 
and throw tliem into co'.l water. They 
must then I* put on the hre again, in tlie 
same water, and Ixtiled gently until tender; 
tlien take them out. and pnt tliem in Cold 
water. After this, l*>il them seven or eight 
tinifs in clarilird >u;u; |xmr the whole 
into an earthen pan, and let it stand. The 
next day drain the fruit, and boil up the 
sirup twenty or thirty times; add a little, 
more sugar, and (xiiir it over the citrons; 
do this fin' tin. days, increasing 

tlie degree to which yon Ixiil the sugar daily, 
so that at the last U.iling tlie degree may 
he em perle. The fruit may then be put 
into pots. 

To pn-ene them dry, they must be done 
exactly the same; only, instead of putting 
tlie fruit into pot-", they should be dried on | 
sieves in a stove. With the remaining su- | 
gar the cilrmi- may be glazed. 

CITRON RATAFIA. Pare seven or 
eight citrons very thin; cut the peel into 
small pieces, and put them into a jar, with 
three pints of brandy, and let them inf.i.-e 
for three weeks; thdi add to tins a pound 
of sugar, Ixjiled in half a pint of water, and 
well ?kimmrd; let it stand twelve or fifteen 
days Linger, when it may !>e bottled. 

(Tn:<>\. siurp OF. (i) Put into 

a china bowl alternate layers of fine powder- 
eugar, and citron, pare<{, and cut in very 



thin slices, and let them sfand till the next 
day; ilu-n strain off tlie sirup, and clarify it 
over a gentle fire. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (2) Put tlie 
rinds of three citrons into an earthen ves- 
sel, and strain on them the juice; to this 
put a little water; pour the mixture into a 
basin in which is four pounds of clarified 
sugar, boiled to fort boulet. Place this 
basin in a large saucepan, half filled with 
water, over the lire; stir the contents of 
the ha:-m freqaeotl] ; and when the sugar ig 
entirely dissolved, and the sirup quite clear, 
take tlie saucepan fiom the fire, and let it 
cool. As soon as it is cold it may be boi- 
tled. 

CITRON NELLE RATAFIA. For 

two quarts of the best brandy, take tlie 
zestes or rinds of a dozen fine sound lem- 
*ons, two drachms of bruised cinnamon, 'an 
ounce of coriander, and two pounds of su- 
gar, dissolved in a pint and a half of water; 
infuse the whole for a month, then strain 
and bottle it. 

ri.OVF.S, OIL OF. This is made in 
the same manner as cinnamonum ; the quanti- 
ties are, an ounce of cloves to three quarts 
of lirandv , and four pounds of sugar dis- 
solved in fin pints cf water. 

CLOVE PASTILS. Are made like 
those of cinnamon. The proportions are 
six cloves to half an ounce of gum-dragon. 

CLOVES, SIRUP OF. Put a quarter 
of a pound of cloves, and a quart of boiling 
water into a slew-pan, cover it close, and 
l'il them gently for half an hour; drain the 
cloves, and to a pint of the liquor put two 
pounds of sugar ; be-.it up two eggs in a little 
cl I water, add them to the above, and sim- 
mer the win Ic. till it becomes a strong sirup. 
When cold, bottle it. 

COFFEE BONBONS. Take about a 
pint of coffee made wiih water; put in it a 
pound of loaf-sugar ; set it on the fire and 
boil it to a high degree; then add u full pint 
of double cream, and let it lx>il again, keep- 
ing continually stirring till it comes to cara- 
mel height ; to know when it is cnme to 
that point, you must have a basin of water 
by you ; dip your finger in it, and put it 
quickly in your sugar, then in tlie water 
again, to remove the sugar, which will have 
stuck to it ; tak,e a bit of it in your teeth; 
if it is hard in its crackling, take it off, it 
la sufficiently done; pour it ii|>on a tin plate, 
which must be rubbed before with a little 
butter, or it will stick to the plate; then 
spread k with a tolling pin; (observe, the 



CON 



276 



CRE 



rolling pin must likewise be rubbed with 
butter, for fear it should stick;) when it is 
warm, you may cut it into little squares, lo- 
zenges, or any other shaped pastilles, and 
draw a few strokes over them with a knife. 

COFFEE CONSERVES. Clarify and 
boil to the first degree a pound of sugar ; 
take the sugar off the fire, and put into it 
one cup of coffee ; stir it alxmt until it comes 
to the sixth degree, that the conserve may 
take the sugar and dry. 

COFFEE EGGS. Make some good 
strong coffee; let it rest to clear as usual, 
and sweeten it with sugar according to dis- 
cretion ; beat up six yolks of eggs, with 
about four cups of coffee, and sift it; pour 
this into little moulds in the form of eggs, or 
of any other, (do not fill them quite,) and 
bake in a mild oven, or a Dutch one, or 
with a brazing-pan ; cover between twfi 
fires. They are made after this manner, in 
the shape of any fruits or birds, if you have 
proper moulds, either of copper or china, 
&c. 

COLTSFOOT, SIRUP OF. Take of 
coltsfoot six ounces, maidenhair two ounces, 
hyssop one ounce, liquorice-root one ounce; 
boil them in two quarts of spring water till 
one fourth is consumed; then strain it, and 
put to the liquor two pounds of fine powder- 
sugar; clarify it with the whites of eggs, 
and boil it till it is nearly as thick us 
honey. 

CONSERVES, DRIED. For all sorts 
of conserves, the sugar should be prepared 
to the ninth degree, according to the quan- 
tity wanted ; they are all made much after 
the same manner, the only difference being 
in the quantity of fruits proposed. Con- 
serves are made with all sorts of sweetmeat 
marmalade, sifted in a sieve, and soaked 
pretty dry over a slow fire ; use about half 
a pound of the sugar thus prepared, to a 
quarter of a pound of sweetmeat marmalade ; 
take the sugar off the fire to work them 
well together; warm the whole for a mo- 
ment, and pour it into paper cases made for 
the purpose; when it is cool it may be cut 
into cakes of what size you please. 

CONSERVE OF FOUR FRUITS. 

Take strawberries, currants, cherries, and 
raspberries, of each a quarter of a pound, 
and three pounds of sugar. Bruise your 
fruit, and having strained off the juice, put 
it in a saucepan over a gentle fire, stirring 
it till reduced to half. Dissolve the sugar, 
skim, and boil it to cause; take it from the 
fire while you put in the juice, then put it 
on again, and give it one boil, take it off, 



and keep stirring till the sugar bubbles, when 
the conserve may be poured into moulds. 

CONSERVES, HARD IN MOULDS. 
These are made in the same manner aa 
other conserves, except that they are com- 
posed of sugar, and distilled aromatic wa- 
ter; and may be colored like pastils. 

CORIANDER DRAGEES. Take any 

quantity of coriander seeds, put them in the 
tossing-pan over the fire, and let them warm ; 
when they are warm throw in about half a 
glass of vinegar, stir them well till they are 
dry ; have clarified sugar, which boil in an- 
other pan ; then when the corianders are 
dry, add a little gum to them, and do the 
same again till they are dry, and continue 
so doing till you see the corianders are cov- 
ered to the size you want (o have them; 
when that is done, take the corianders out 
from the pan, wash them well, anil put them 
in again, and stir them well till they are all 
warm ; then take your clarified sugar, which 
you have previously boiled to the first de- 
gree ; when this is done, put it in an instru- 
ment of copper, made on purpose for the 
operation, and at the bottom of \\Miich there 
is a little hole; hang it up by a packthread 
string, that the sugar may fall from about a 
yard height into the pan where the corian- 
ders are ; while the sugar falls into your pan 
keep stirring well your dragees till you see 
they are well pearled over, or rough and 
grainy ; when they are sufficiently so, take 
them out, and place them in the stove to 
finish drying. 

CORIANDER SUGARED. These 
seeds are sugared in the same manner as 
sugared almonds. 

CREAM, BAIN-MARIE. Mix up 

whatever ingredient of which the cream 
is to be made, with eggs and sugar ; for the 
proportions, see the respective articles; 
strain them through a fine sieve, and pour 
the preparation into a mould lightly buttered 
within side. Put this mould into a large 
saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of boil- 
ing water to reach within an inch of the 
mould ; place the saucepan on hot ashes, 
cover it, and place hot coals on the lid; 
renew the fire underneath occasionally, so 
as to keep the water at the same tempera- 
ture, that is, nearly, but never quite, boil- 
ing for an hour and a half; then, if the 
cream is properly set, which may be known 
by touching it with your finger, and observ- 
ing whether it may be easily detached from 
the mould, take it from the bain-marie and 
let it stand ; when no more than lukewarm, 
turn it out on your dish. 

It sometimes happens, unavoidably, that 



CRE 



277 



CRO 



bubbles arise on the surface of '.he cream ; 
in such a case, boil a glass of cream, and 

add to it, by degrees, three yolks of eggs; 
stir it constantly with a wooden spoon; mix 
three ounces of line Migar with it, and con- 
tinue stirring it over the lire, till of a proper 
consistence, and on the point of boiling, 
then take it off arid strain it. When the 
cream is ready for table, cover it complete- 
ly with the last made cream, which will 
hide its defects. 

CREAM BISCUITS. Break six eggs, 
separate the volks and whites, beat the 
former with six ounces of powder-sugar, 
and the same of flour; whisk the whites, 
and then mix them together ; add to it 
whip|>od cream, in proportion to the sugar 
and tloiir, stir it carefully, pour this into 
moulds or paper cases, and bake. 

CREAM CARAMEL. Put a pint of 

milk and half a pint of cream, with a bit 
of cinnamon, some coriander-seeds, and 
die peel of a yiuns; lemon, into a saucepan, 
and li"il (hem for a quarter of an hour; 
then take it off the lire; and l>il a quarter 
of a pound of sugar with half a glass of wa- 
ter, until it Ix'comes of a nice dark color; 
take it off the Cue, am I mix with the cream; 
then put it mi the tin- again, until the sugar 
and cream are well mixed together; then 
place a saucepan, with some hot water in 
it, over hot a>hcs ; take a di.-h, in which 
you intend serving, and |x>ur into it your 
cream, then place it in the sauce|xin ; put 
on the lid of the saucepan, with fire atiove, 
and let it boil till the cream Is set. Serve 
hot. 

CREAM, SXOW. Put to a quart of 

cream the whites of three eggs well lieaten, 

four spoonfuls of swi-et wine, sugar to your 

.d a bit of lemon-peel ; whip it to a 

froth ; remove the peel, and serve in a dish. 

CRKAM OF ANY PRESERVED 

FRl'IT. Take half a pound of the pulp 
of any preserved fruit, put it in a large pan, 
put to it the w hites of two or three eggs, beat 
together well for an hour; take it off widi 
a spoon, and lav it heaped on a dish, or 
pla-s s;ihei, with other creams, or put it 
in the middle of a basin. Raspberries will 
not do this way. 

CREAM RHEMSH. Put over the 
fire a pint of Khenish wine, a stick of cin- 
namon, anil half A pound of sugar; while 
this is Iniiling, take w\en \olks and whites 
, lieat them well together with a 
whisk, till your wine is half driven in them, 
and your egjfa 10 a sirup; strike it very 5ut 
with the whi.-k, till it comes to such thick- 
24 



ness that you may lift it on the point of a 
knife, but be sure not to let it curdle; add 
to it the juice of a lemon, and orange-flower 
water; pour it into your dish; garnish it 
with citron, sugar, or biscuit, and serve. 

CREAM, ROYAL ICES. Take any 
quantity of cream, add to it yolks of eggs in 
proportion (that is, four yolks of eggs to 
every pint of cream) put a little half pound- 
ed coriander, cinnamon, orange or lemon- 
peel; add some pounded lump sugar, and 
set it on the fire till it nearly boils; then 
pass it through a sieve, and put it to ice. 

CREAM, WHITE SHERBET. Put 

the yolks of six eggs, and a dessert spoon- 
ful of orange-flower water or crisped orange 
flowers in powder, into two quarts of cream, 
and boil it up once in a covered saucepan; 
then pass it through a sieve, add to it three- 
quarters of a pound of powder-sugar, and 
as soon as it is perfectly dissolved, pour the 
whole into a sorbetiere, which place in an 
ice pail, and proceed to cool it as directed. 
See Sherbet. 

CREAM SNOW. Mix a quart of 
cream with the whites of six eggs, sweeten 
it with sugar and rose water, and strain 
them ; then I, cat up the cream with a bundle 
of reeds tied together, or with a whisk; 
and aa the snow rises take it up with a 
spoon in the cullender, that the liquid part 
may run out: when you have taken off as 
much of the snow as you please, boil the 
rest of the cream, w ith a stick of cinnamon, 
some cloves, and a little bruised ginger; 
boil it till it is thick; strain it, and when 
it is cold, put it into a dish, and lay your 
snow upon it. 

CREAM, CARAMEL WHIPPED. 

Boil six ounces of sugar to caramel, and 
when it has acquired the proper reddish, 
yellow tinge, dissolve it in half a glass 
of boiling water, over hot a.-lirs; after 
which, it must be reduced to a rather thick 
sirup. When cold, mix it with the whip- 
ped cream in the usual way. See Whip- 
ped Cream. 

CROQUETTES OF DESTREES. 

Use the best puff paste ; roll it pretty thin, 
and cut it into different shapes, as fancy 
leads ; bake it, and dress each piece upon 
a dish, in a handsome manner; rub them 
with a little caramel, to make diem stick 
as you place them ; then put some currant 
jelly all over the top, and make what flow- 
er or design you please, with nonpareils of 
different colors, round it. 

CROQUETTES OF PARIS. Tk 



CUR

CUR 



A stick of vanilla, pound it with two 
ounces of sugar, and silt both through a 
silk sieve; mix it with seven ounces of 
sugar, well dried and pounded, and half 
a pound of fine sifted flour; then stir in the 
whites of four eggs, whipped firm, and 
work the whole together for some minutes. 

Heat two large baking-plates of copper, 
rub them over lightly with virgin wax; when 
they are cold, take a spoonful of the prepa- 
ration, and lay it on the plate the same as 
the spoon-biscuit?, taking care to lay them 
three-quarters of an inch apart ; when both 
plates are full, place them on stools, in the 
oven or stove ; close the top, and lay embers 
oVer it, so that the croquettes may be as far 
removed from the fire as possible ; let them 
remain in this state all night; the next 
morning put them into a moderate oven, and 
bake them fifteen or twenty minutes; they 
should then quit the plate easily, and be of 
a clear reddish color; remove them from 
the plates whilst hot. The croquettes 
may be flavored according to your fancy. 

CURACAO. This is a species of bitter 
or wild orange, of which the rind is dried, 
and may be had at the druggists. To make 
the liqueur called by this name, wash a 
pound of curacao several times in warm 
water; then, having well drained, put them 
into a vessel with four quarts of brandy, and 
one of water; let it stand closely covered 
for a fortnight, shaking it frequently; distil 
it after that in the usual way, and drain the 
curacao on a sieve. Sweeten it with five 
pounds and a half of sugar, dissolved in 
three pints of water, mix it with the spirit 
and then filter it. 

CURDS AND WHEY. Take a num- 
ber of the rough coals that line the gizzards 
of turkeys and fowls; clean (hem from the 
pebbles "they contain, rub them well with 
salt, and hang them to dry. This makes a 
more tender and delicate curd than common 
rennet. When to l)e used, break off some 
bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling 
water; in eight or nine hours use the liquor 
ae you do other rennet. 

CURRANT CAKES. Pick and wash 
the currants, either white or red ; to two 
quarts of currants, put one pint of water; 
when boiled, run the juice through a jelly 
bag, do not press the bag ; to one quart of 
juice put three pounds of sugar; boil up the 
juice, and strew in the sugar ; pour it into 
glasses, dry it in a stove till it will turn out, 
then dry the cakes on plates. 

CURRANTS, CONSERVE OF. 
Take tlie seeds from two pounds of red cur- 
rants, and put them on the fire in a silver 



pan, to dry them ; then press them through 
a sieve, and put thorn again on the fire, stir- 
ring constantly until you can see the bottom 
of the pan; then, having dissolved and boil- 
ed three pounds of sugar to casse, pour it on 
the fruit, stirring continually ; in a short 
time take it off, stirring it as before until it 
bubbles ; then pour it into moulds. 

CURRANT ICES. (1) Boil two pounds 
of red currants a moment with a quarter of 
a pound of raspberries ; rub them through a 
sieve, adding a pint of water, and tlien the 

sugar, which must be very well dissolved 
u r 
before icing. 

CURRANT ICES. (2) Pick some cur- 
rants from their stalks, and squeeze them 
through a sieve; then take clarified sugar, 
boil it to a very high degree, add it to your 
currant juice, and, if you choose, squeeze in 
the juice of four lemons, it will make it 
more mellow; strain them through the sieve 
a second time, put them in the icing pot, and 
finish the same as all other ices. 

CURRANT ICE CREAM. Take one 
large spoonful and a half of currant jelly, 
put it into a basin, with half a gill of sirup, 
squeeze in one lemon and a half; add a pint 
of cream and a little cochineal, then pass it 
through a sieve, and freeze it according to 
custom. 

CURRANT WATER ICE. Take a 
large spoonful and a half of currant jelly, put 
it into a basin, and add to it the juice of 
two lemons, half a gill of sirup, and a pint 
of water: then freeze it rich. 

CURRANT JELLY FRAMBOISEE. 
Take seven pounds of fine ripe red currants, 
three of white, and Iwo of white raspber- 
ries, press them through a very cluse horse- 
hair sieve; pour the juice on nine pounds 
of double-refined sugar, broken in small 
pieces, place the whole on a brisk fire, tak- 
ing care to remove the scum as soon as it 
appears. When the boilings follow each 
other very quickly, take out the skimmer, 
(which should be of copper) stir it, and let 
the jelly tall from it ; on quitting the skim- 
mer it ought to fall like treacle. If it does 
so, it is sufficiently done. This jelly should 
be rose-colored; by making it entirely of 
red currants and red rasplwrries, the color 
of the jelly will be red. 

CURRANT PASTE. Pick and take 
the seeds from ten pounds of fine red cur- 
rants, crush them, and having pressed out 
the juice, SUM in it through a silk sieve. 
Clarify and boil to casse an equal quantity 
of sugar, |H)ur the currant juice oil it, set the

whole over a gentle fire, stirring constantly 
until it becomes of a proper consistence, 
which may lie known by observing when the 
bottom of the pan cun be seen clearly; take 
it off from the fire as soon as that is the 
case, and pour the paste into tin moulds, 
which must be placed on slates, or copper 
plates: smooth the tops with the blade of a 
knife, sprinkle sifted sugar over, and pluce 
them in a stove, H here they must remain till 
next day ; when tl>e paste should l>e turned 
in the moulils; sprinkle sifted sugar over 
them again, and set them in the stove a 
second night; on the following day remove 
them from the moulds, lay it in boxes, \vilh 
white paper between each layer, and keep 
thru, in a dry place. A sixth part of the 
quantity of raspberries added to the currants, 
would greatly improve the flavor of this 
paste. 

CURRANT PASTILS. Take half a 
pound of |x>unded loaf sugar on a plate, then 
a quantity of currants, which squeeze through 
a MI-MS when that is done, add the juice to 
the sugar, till it makes a paste as clear and 
thick as you think proper. 

CURRANT SIIRrn. To five pints of 
Currant juice, either red or white, one pound 
and a half of loaf sugar; when dissolved, 
put to it one gallon of rum or brandy ; clear 
it through a flannel bag. 

CURRANT SIRUP. Put five or six 
pounds of red, two of white currants, and 
two Ixittles of raspberries, into a sieve; crush 
tlieni, and press the juice through it into a 
pan, and place it in a cellar to ferment; in a 
week's time, pass the juice through a strain, 
ing bag, and having clarified, and boiled to 
fort souffle four pounds of sugar, put the 
juice to it, and boil them together once; 
skim, and take it from the lire. It is ne- 
cessary that the currant juice should ferment, 
to prevent its becoming a jelly in the bottles. 



D. 

DRAGEES, COMMON. The paste for 
these dragees is made in lire same manner 
as for the better sort, but the materials differ 
a little: thus to a quarter of a pound of the 
gum, take either equal quantities of sugar 
nnd powder, or one-third of the former to 
two-thirds of the latter. VVIicn these and 
the gum art- well mixed, roll out the paste 
until it is as thin as the back of a knife- 
blade; then take a jiaMr-ciitter, shaped like 
a sugar-loaf, with the tup taken off, with ibe 
ml of which, rut as many piece* of 
the paste us will about two-thirds till the 



cutter ; press these through the smaller end 
into paper cases; set them in a warm place 
for several days. These kind of dragees 
may, if liked, "be sugared in die same man- 
ner as almonds. 

DRAGEES EN PASTILLAGE. These 

dragees are made of the same materials as 
the superfine dragees; the only difference 
consists in their forms, which resemble the 
bonbons: to make them, it is necessary to 
have a number of wooden moulds, (pear- 
tree wood is the best), on which must be 
stamped small squares, with various device* 
engraved on them. Cut your paste into 
small pieces; press each piece on a mould; 
take off alj the super-abundant paste ; then 
dip your finger in water, and with it remove 
the paste from the mould; dry them in case* 
like die other drageet. 

DRAGEES, SUPERFINE. Put a 

quarter of a pound of die best gum-dragon 
into a pan, with a pint of cold water, cover, 
and let it stand for twenty-four hours; then 
take a strong close cloth, about two feet 
long, and put a part of your gum into it; 
fold it three times, so as to envelope the gum; 
then wring the cloth, by which means the 
purest gum will be forced through ; scrape 
it off carefully with a knife, and then proceed 
in die same way, until all the gum be train- 
ed ; put it into a marble mortar, and stir it 
about with a pestle for half an hour; then 
add to it a pound of double-refined sifted 
sugar; mix them together well, until it be- 
comes a stiff paste; divide this into five 
parts, four of which must be tinged as fol- 
lows: red, blue, yellow, and green, (the fifth 
left white), with the usual coloring materials. 
Before, however, diey are colored, add to 
each piece, a pound and a half of double- 
refined sugar, sifted, dipping the paste in 
water occasionally, to enable it to receive 
the additional quantity of sugar. When you 
mix in the coloring materials, add also a 
corresponding perfume: as, to die red, rose- 
water, and a few drops of essence of roses ; 
to die blue, oil of violets ; to the yellow, es- 
sence of cedar; to die green, essence of 
bergamot ; and with die white, mix a little 
orauge-tlower water, and some drops of es- 
sence of Neroli. 

Your paste being dius prepared, form it 
of whatever little ornaments you please, such 
as egg?, balls, turnips, (adding green leaves 
to the*-), 8tc. of die white; of the yellow, 
apricot.-!, pears, carrots, &c. ; plums, &c. 
of the blue; and so on; rolling them in your 
hands to smooth diem, and make them all 
quite small; to those which imitate fruits, 
add tails and tops, cut from cherry-stalks, 
and muck on whilst the paste is damp; and 
with u hair-pencil, dipped in powdered cio-

paper cases, and set them in a warm place 
for several days, to dry. 



E. 



EGGS CARAMEL. Take the yolks 
of a dozen hard eggs, bruise them in a sauce- 
pan, with some powder-sugar, three almond 
biscuits, and half a glass of cream; make

dip them in caramel sugar, and brown them. 

EGGS DUCHESSE. Boil a pint and 
a half of cream with some sugar, orange- 
flower, candied lemon-peel, marchpane, and 
burn: almonds, all chopped small or bruised ; 
whip up the whites of eight eggs well, and 
then take two or three spoonfuls of them at 
a time, and poach them in the cream ; drain, 
and lay them on a dish, so as to resemble 
eggs poached without the yolks. When all 
the whites are thus used, put the cream on 
the fire, and reduce it, and as the dish is 
gent to table, add the yolks to the cream, 
and pour die sauce gently over the eggs. 

EGGS FILAGRAMME. Take a pint 
of white wine, half a pound of fine powder- 
sugar, 'and make it into a clear sirup with 
the white of an egg; beat up well eight 
eggs, and pour them through a colander 
into the sirup; a very short time is sufficient 
to cook them. Serve either hot or cold. 

EGGS OF SNOW. Break ten eggs, 
and having separated the yolks and whites, 
whip the latter as for biscuits; then add 
two spoonfuls of powder-sugar, and a little 
dried orange-flower in powder. Pour a 
quart of milk, six ounces of powder-sugar, 
and a little orange-flower, into a saucepan, 
and when it boils put into it, a dessert-s|x>on- 
ful at a time, of the white of egg ; poach ihe 
latter, ami then set them on a sieve to drain. 
Then beat up the yolks, and mix them with 
half the milk, put it on the fire, and stir it 
with a wooden-spoon till it begins to thick- 
en ; then take it off, lay the poached eggs in 
a dish, and cover them with the yolks and 
milk. 

EGGS, WHITE OF. To make a dish 
of these, take the whites of twelve eggs, 
beat them up with four spoonfuls of rose-wa- 
ter, some lemon-peel grated, and a little 
nutmeg; sweeten them with sugar, mix 
them well, and boil them in four bladders; 
tie them in the shape of an egg, and boil 
them hard; they will take half an hour; 



lay them in a dish ; when cold, mix half a 
pint of thick cream, a gill of mountain, and 
the juice of half an orange all together; 
sweeten it with line sugar, and serve it over

FILBERT BISCUITS. Take some 
Barcelona filbert nuts, and put them in a mor- 
tar to break their shells ; pick all the shells 
from them clean, pound them in a mortar 
very fine, and mix whites of eggs with them ; 
take care they do not oil ; mix three pounds 
of powdered-sugar, with the nuts and whites 
of eggs, to a proper thickness ; let your oven 
be of a moderate heat, then with the spaddlc 
and knife, drop small pieces, about half as 
big as a nutmeg; put two or three sheets of 
paper under them, let them bake of a fine 
brown, and all alike; and let them be cold 
before you take them off the paper. 

FILBERT CANNELLONS. Burn 

and pound six ounces of filberts, moist- 
ening them with white of egg; when well 
pounded, add a quarter of a pound of 
fine pounded sugar, and half the white of an 
egg; dry this paste a little, and then press 
it through a syringe, cutting the cannelloni 
about four inches in length ; make the fri- 
ture quite hot, dip the cannellons in batter, 
and fry them. Sprinkle them with sugar, 
and glaze them with a salamander. Take 
particular care to keep the cannellons per- 
fectly straight. 

FILBERT BURNT, ICE CREAM. 

Roast some Barcelona nuts well in the oven, 
and pound them a little with some cream; 
put four eggs into a stewpan, with one pint 
of cream and two gills of sirup; boil it till it 
Incomes thick, pass it through a sieve, and 
freeze it; then mix the filberts with it be- 
fore you put it into your moulds. 

FILBERT MACAROONS. Take a 
pound of filberts, and put a quarter of them 
into a preserving-pan (immediately after you 
have taken them from the shells,) over a 
moderate fire; stir them continually with a 
silver spoon, until they are colored, and the

rub off the skin entirely, and when quite 
cold, pound them with a little white of egg: 
proceed in the same manner with the re- 
maining three-quarters; and when all are 
thus pounded separately, put the whole to- 
gether into the mortar, with a pound of 
sugar, and the whites of two eggs, and beat 
them for ten minutes; after which, add two 
pounds more of sifted sugar, previously beat'

ever, it ! too firm, add to it mure white of 
egg. When you have proceeded so far, wet 
the palms of your hands, and roll a spoonful 
of the preparation to the si/.c and form of a 
miluiei:; when all rlone, dip your hands in 
water, and pass them gently o\er the maca- 
roons, which will make their surface smooth

fine powder-sugar, until it roines to a supple 
paste, not too liquid ; then bike them on 
paper in a moderate oven. 



G. 

GINGER, CANDIED. Put an ounce 
of ginger, grated fine, and a pound of rifted 
migar into a pre-sem-iu-pan with as much 
water as will dissolve it. Stir them well 
together <>\er a slow fire, till the sugar l>e- 
gi'is to boil; then add another pound, stir- 
ring constantly till it thickens. Take it 
from ihe liie, drop it on eailhen i!

the sugar: stir it well; simmer it well till 
the su_r;ir is unhid; pour it into glasses: 
dry it in a stove till it w ill turn out, then 
dry the cakes on plates. 

GOOSEBERRIES, GREEN, COM- 
POTE OF. Give them a little cut on one 
side to squeeze out the seeds, and put them 
in hot water to scald, till they rise to the 
top; then put cold water to them, adding a 
little salt, to bring them to their natural 
green; simmer them in clarified sugar, and 
lei them remain in sometime to imbibe the 
sweet; take them out, and put th. in in the 
eompotier ; reduce the simp to a good con- 
sistence, and pour it over the fruit. This 
is for green gooselxrries ; but if you make 
use of preserved ones, warm diem in their 
own sirup and a little, water, and serve it 
either hot or cold. These will not keep 
long, particularly if they have been wanned 
again: if exposed to the air any time, they 
will lose their color. 

GRAPE ICE. Take ripe grapes, pick 
them from their stalks, pa.-s them through 
a sieve; mix some sugar widi the juice of 
four lemons squeezed upon it ; pass the 
whole together a second time through a 
sieve, then freeze it. 

GRAPES RATAFIA. Take some 
fine muscadine grapes, pick them from the 
stalks; bruise and press (hem, so as to ex- 
tract all their juice ; then dissolve some su- 
gar in the grape juice, adding to it Iwandy 
and cinnamon; let the whole infuse for a 
fortnight ; then strain it through a filtering 
b:n;, and Ixittle it off. The proper propor- 
tions are one pint of brandy, and ten ounces 
of sugar to one pint of grujie juice. 

GREEN-GAGES TO CANDY. When 
finished in the sirup, (see preen-gaget to 
pretfrve,) put a layer into a new sieve, 
and dip it slid lenly into hot water, to take 
off the sirup that hangs about it ; then put 
it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and 
then do some more on the sieve. Have 
ready some silled double-refined sugar, gift 
this all over every part of the fruit, till it IB 
perfectly while. Set it on the shallow end 
of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn 
it two or three times. It must not be cold 
till dry. Watch it carefully. 

GREEN GAGES TO PRESERVE. 

You must choose the largest, when they b*- 
ginto soften; split without paring them, ami 
having previously weighed an equal quant i- 
1 ir, strew a part of it over them; 
blanch the kernels with a small sharp knife ; 
next day, [.our the sirup from the fruit, and 
boil it with the other sugar, very gently, for 



JUN

six or eight minutes; skim, and add the 
plums and kernels. Simmer till clear, 
taking off any scum that rises; put the fruit 
single into small pots, and pour the sirup 
and kernels upon it. 

GUM PASTE. Put a pound of gum- 
dragon in a basin, with warm water enough 
to cover one inch above the gum ; set this in 
a warm closet for four and twenty hours ; 
have a new tammy ready laid over a dish; 
spread it on it, and squeeze through as 
much as you can at first ; then open the 
tammy, spread the gum out again, and then 
squeeze it; repeat this till the whole is 
through ; then lay it on the slab, work it 
well with your hand, put in nearly all the 
juice of one lemon, and a pound of the best 
double refined powder-sugar, by degrees, as 
you work it; but before you have put in the 
whole of the sugar, begin lo add some of 
the best starch powder; blend them thor- 
oughly together, till the paste lgins to 
take an impression ; then roll it in a cloth, 
and let it stand in a damp place for a week 
or ten days, (it is the better for keeping), 
work it will] powder, and it will cut and 
mould to any shape you please, and when 
you want it to harden, set it in a dry place; 
if you wish to color it, to make it red, use 
cochineal or carmine ; fur blue or violet 
color, use indigo; for yellow, saffron; for 
green, the juice of beet leaves, scalded over 
the fire, the thick part mix with the paste. 
When you put in colors, \x careful to blend 
them well, and be particular that the color 
is good. 



H. 

HARTSHORN CREAM. Boil a quar- 
ter of a pound of hartshorn-shavings in three 
pints of water; when reduced to half a pint, 
strain it through a jelly-bag; put it to a 
pint of cream and a quarter of a pound of 
powder-sugar, and give them one boil to- 
gether ; then put it into cii|>s or glasses, and 
let them stand till cold, when turn them out 
on a dish; stick some sliced blanched al- 
monds on the top of each. White wine 
and sugar is. usually eaten with them. 



J. 



JUNIPER BERRIES, ICES OF. In- 
fuse some juniper berries in warm water, 
or take about a handful of the berries, and 
boil them a moment with a pint of water, 
half a pound of sugar, and a bit of cinna- 
mon, and sifc them through a sieve with ex- 
pression, and finish the same as all others. 



JUNIPER RATAFIA. Take three 
ounces of juniper berries, anise, corian- 
der, cinnamon, and cloves, of each eight- 
een grains; bruise all these ingredients, and 
infuse them, for a month, in three pints of 
brandy ; then strain it, add three-QuarUm> 
of a pound of sugar dissolved in half a pint 
of water, stir them together, pass the whole 
through a jelly-bag, and bottle it ; keep it 
well corked. 



L. 



LEMON BRANDY. Put the peel of 
two lemons into a bottle of brandy, let it 
stand for four and twenty hours, then strain 
it; Iwil two ounces of loaf sugar in a quar- 
ter of a pint of water; then skim, and let it 
stand till cold; when cold, mix it with the 
brandy. 

LEMON CAKES. Quarter as many 
lemons as you think proper, they must have 
good rinds, and boil them in two or three 
waters, till they are tender, and have lost 
their bitterness; then skin them, and put 
them in a napkin to fry; with a knife take 
all the skins and seeds out of the pulp, shred 
the peels fine, put them to the pulp, uci^h 
them, and put rather more than their weight 
of fine sugar into a tossing-pan, with just 
sufficient water to dissolve the sugar; boil 
it till it becomes perfectly dissolved, and 
then by degrees put in the peel and pulps; 
stir them well before you set them on the 
fire, boil it very gently till it looks clear and 
thick, and then put it into flat-bottomed 
glasses; set them in a stove, and keep them 
in a continual and moderate heat, and turn 
them out upon glasses, as soon as they arc 
candied. 

LEMON COMPOTE. Cut them in 
small pieces, and boil them in water till 
they are tender, tl>en change them into cold 
water; then make a sirup with a glass of 
water, and a quarter of a pound of sugar, 
and put in the fruit ; let it simmer gently 
over a slow fire for half an hour, and serve 
cold. 

LEMON CONSERVE. Grate the rind 
of a lemon on a piece of sugar (about a 
pound,) scrape off the surface of the sugar 
as the lemon adheres to it, until you have 
rasped the whole of die rind ; squeeze half 
the juice on the scraped sugar, and then 
boil the rest to la grande plume; take it 
from the fire when at this degree, and let it 
stand a little; stir in the lemon gently, and 
when it forms a sort of glace on the top of 
the sugar, pour the conserve into moulds ;

I.r.MONS TO KEEP FOR PUD- 
DINGS. When you squeeze the fruit, 
throw the outside in water, without the 
pulp ; let tin-in remain in the sum- a I'.nt- 
nignt, adding no more; Ixiil them in the 
same til! ii -nder ; strain it from them, and 
when the\ ai-e nearly dry, throw them into 
nny jar of candv you may have remaining 
from iilii sweetmeats; or, if you haxe none, 
boil a small ijiianlily of sirup, of common 
1" il".-i:_;:ir and uater, and (xuir over them ; 
in a week or ten days, lioil them gently in 
it till they look clear; and that they may

LEMON PEEL, TO CANDY. Take 
some lemon-peels, and clean them well from 
i lie pulp, and let them lay txvo days in salt 
and xvater; then scald and drain them dry, 
then boil them in a thin sirup till they look 
<|itile clear. After which, take them out, 
and have ready a thick sirup made xxith fine 
loaf sugar ; put them into it, and simmer 
them till the sugar-candies about the pan and 
peels. Then lay them separately on a hair 
sieve to drain, strew sifted sugar over tliem, 
and eet tliem to dry in a slow oven. 

LEMOiV PEEL, CARAMEL. Take 

some very dry preserved lemon-|>oel, and 
cut it into several small square pieces ; piH 
tltese pieces each on the point of little slick* 
for this purpose, and dip them into caramel 
sugar as directed. See chestnuts au car- 
amel. 

LEMON PEEL SIRUP OF. Take 

five ounces of fresh lemon-peel, put it into a 
ylass cuciirhite, which has been gradually 
heated ; pour on them txvo pounds of nearly 
Ixiilini; xvater; close the vessel very tight, 
and place it on hot ashes for txvelvc hours; 
after which, let the infusion run out gently 
without pressing the peel ; add two pounds 
of poxvder-sugar, and then boil the whole to 
grand perle, when about half cold, put in 
a few drops of spirit of lemon. 

LEMON SWEETMEATS. Take a 
pound of marchpane paste, and mix it with 
as many yolks of eggs as will enable you to 
spread the paste with a knife; add to it a 
sufficient quantity of grated lemon-peel to 
impart the flavor required. The whole 
being well mixed, cut some sheets of wafer 
(taper into such figures as your fancy may 
dictate, and spread tile paste over tliem, 
about a quarter of an inch in thickness; 
place them on paper, and bake tliem in a 
HUH lei ate ox-en. If you xx ish to laze your 
sweetmeats, Ixiil some SUgiir xvilll oranije- 
tlmver water to la plume, and when they 
are taken out of the oven, wash them ox'er 
with the .-irup, which dries almost immedi- 
ately. 

LEMONS, SIRUP OF. Squeeze aa 

many lemons as will yield alxiul three-quar- 
ters of a |xinml of juice, taking particular 
care that tlie peel of every lemon is perfectly 
found, and that they are none of them in the 
least degree bitter. Set your juice in tlie 
cellar tin four days, and then lilicr it through 
blutiiii^-paper. Break u pound and u half 
of double-refined -n^.ir inin pieces alwiut an

pour the lemon-juice over it, dose the mat- 
rass with paper, and place it in a liain ma- 
rie until the sugar is entirely dissolved ; then 
extinguish your fire, and let the matrass cool 
gradually ; when cold, add two spoonfuls of 
spirit of lemons, then bottle it, keep it well 
corked. 

LEMON WAFERS. Squeeze the juice 
of six lemons into a basin ; pound and sift 
some double-refined sugar, and mix it with | 
the lemon-juice ; put the white of one egg 
with it, and mix the whole well together 
with a wooden spoon, to make it of a good 
consistence ; lake some sheets of wafer-pa- 
per, and put one sheet of it on a pewter 
sheet or tin plate; put on it a spoonful of | 
the preparation, and spread it all over the 
paper with a knife ; cut it into twelve pieces, I 
and put them across a stick in a hot stove, 
with that side the paste is on uppermost, 
and you will find they will curl ; when they 
are half curled, take them oft" very care-fully 
and put them up, endways, in a sieve, that 
they may stand up ; let them l>e in the hot 
stove one day, and you will find they will be 
all curled, and then they are done. 

I 

LIQUORICE PASTE. Scrape and j 
bruise a quarter of a pound of liquorice-root, ! 
and boil it in a little water till it is much 
reduced ; let it stand to settle, and pour it I 
clear off, and dissolve in it half an ounce 
of gum-dragon : when thoroughly dissolved, 
sift it in a linen bag, and mix sugar with it 
till it is brought to the consistence of :i paste ; 
then cut it into what flowers or designs you 
think proper. 



M. 

MACAROONS, SPICED. Take a 
pound of sweet almonds, and two pounds of 
sifted sugar; make your paste as usual, to 
which add a spoonful of powdered cinnamon, 
six or eight cloves, also pounded, some pre- 
served lemon and orange-peel (of each a 
spoonful,) chopped small, and the grated 
rind of two lemons; mix them all together 
in the mortar, and then lay your macaroons 
as usual, and bake them with equal care. 

MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. The 

macedoine is an ornamental dish, composed 
of transparent jelly, with various fruits en- 
closed in it; for this purpose it should l>e 
done as follows: Have a dome-shaped mould 
six inches and a half in diameter, and four 
in height, the sides fluted ; the smaller mould 
must be of a similar firm, but only four inrh- 
cs and a half in diameter, and two auJ three- 
quarters high ; to this latter have four bun- 
dles, bent at the end, to hang it exactly in 



the centre of the larger mould. Prepare a 
strawlierry transparent jelly, place the larger 
mould as straight as possible in pounded ice, 
hang the small one in it, and pour the jelly 
into the former; whilst it is congealing, 
pick alxmt twenty fine white strawberries, 
the same numter of very red ones, the same 
of white raspberries, a dozen bunches of red, 
and the same of white currants; wash all 
these well, but touch them as little as possi- 
ble, that they may not lose their freshness; 
when the jelly is perfectly set, pour some 
hot water into the small mould which will 
enable you to remove it with ease; raise it 
with great care, so that the space may be 
found without the slightest flaw; then place 
on the jelly (in thj centre of this spare) two 
hunches of white currants, surround these 
with a ring of white straw-terries, and the 
latter with a crown or ring of white rasp- 
terries; pour over very cart-fully two or 
three spoonfuls of the jelly, and when that is 
eonin-aled, proceed in the same way with 
the red currants, straw terries, and raspber- 
ries, then the jelly, and so on alternately, 
until all the fruit is used ; fill the. mould w ith 
jelly; as soon as ihe whole is congealed, dip 
your mould into a large saucepan of hot 
water, and then turn it into a dish instantly. 
The macedoine may be garnished in this 
manner \\itli any kind of fruit you think 
proper. It may also be filled with two jel- 
lies as follows: white lemon jelly in the 
large mould, and finished with the same 
jelly, tinned with eitlier rose-color or yellow ; 
indeed the moulds may be varied in any way 
your fancy may dictate. 

MALLOWS, SIRUP OF. Take half 
a pound of mallows root, and having scrap- 
ed and washed it wc-ll, cut it into small 
pieces, which set on the fire with three pints 
of water; when sufficiently boiled, the wa- 
ter will te glutinous, strain oft' the decoction, 
and pour into it four pounds of sugar ; clari- 
fy it in the same manner as capillaire; boil 
it to lisse, run it through a jelly-bag, and 
when cold, bottle it. 

MARASCHINO. Take sixteen poun Is 
of fine sharp cherries, stone and take off 
the stalks; put them into five quarts of 
brandy to infuse, covered close for three 
days, then distil the infusion; distil also a 
pound of cherry-leaves in six quarts of filter- 
ed river water, from which you will obtain 
about a gallon; dissolve in this four pounds 
and a half of fine sugar; add it to the li- 
queur, with two pints and a half of kirschen- 
wasser, an ounce and four drachms of spirits 
of rose, the same of orange-flowers, and 
three drachms of spirits of jessamine; mix 
them altogether, run it through a jelly-bag, 
and bottle it; cork them well.

MARASCHINO, CONSERVE OF. 

Pound and sift some of the best lump sugar, 
mix it in a china l>;isin with spirit of maras- 
chino, until it is of the consistence of pastil 
parte; then put it into a skillet over the fire, 
and heat il gently, stirring it constantly (but 
without letting it Ixiil,) till very liquid, when 
it may lx- |X)iired into funnel-shaped tin 
moulds ; put tltese moulds on iron plates, 
and dry the conserve in a stove. 

MARASCHINO ICE CREAM. Take 

two t|iiarl.- nf cream, twelve eggs, a pound 
of double-refined sugar, and three glasses 
of true maraschino ; put the cream on to 
boil, and in the meantime whisk the whites 
of tl>e eggs to a firm snow, then pour in 
eight yolks, and the sugar pounded and 
sifted, stir them together lightlv, and then 
add by degress the boiling cream, whipping 
continually ; set it on the fire, and do not 
cease whipping until it has boiled up three 
or four times; pour it through a sieve into 
a basin, .-.lining a little to enable it to run 
more freely; when cold put it into the sor- 
betiere with the maraschino; cover it in- 
stantly, ami ice it ad usual. 

MARCHPANE. Take four pounds of 
sweet alnn'ii'!?-, throw them into boiling 
water, let them lay till the skin loosens, 
then put them into cold water, after a few 
minutes Uanch anil throw them again into 
cold water to wash them thoroughly. When 
dry, pound them (a handful at a time) to a 
very tine paste, moistening each handful 
with two spoonfuls of water; the whole 
quantity of almonds being pounded, put the 
paste into a large preserving pan, with (our 
pounds of the l>est lump sugar finely |xiuud- 
ed and silled ; set the pan on a coal fire, 
stir and work them up together with a 
idcn spatula, rather sharp at the 
bottom: Ix- very can-fill that none of the 
paste adheres to the pan ; the consequence 
of such neglect would Ix-, that the march- 
pane woiiM lie spotted with yellow, and 
would smell unpleasantly. Whilst winking 
it up, ihc |;:i-tc, which when put in was 
tolerably (inn, will become rather liquid, 
and a great deal of vajior may be olwerved ; 
the tii>i is caused by the sugar dissolved by 
the heat and inoi-ttire, the second by tlie 
eva|x>ration of the water. Continue to stir 
mid work it up in this manner without 
ceasing for two hours, and if at the end of 
that time, \ou can toueh the paste without 
it* adhering to your tiogi-rs, it is .-ufhcicntlv 
dried; in which case lemovc it all to one 
aide of the pan, clean the Ixittom and side 
of the other, sprinkle it well wilh flour, then 
put the pa.-ti- to that pait, clean and .-prin- 
kle that .-!.< also; then lake the pan by 
both cars and move it round and round, so 



that the paste may all unite together; as 
soon as it has done so, put it into a sheet of 
paper, or, if you want to use it immediate- 
ly, on a well (loured table. This paste, if 
the almonds he well pounded and then thor- 
oughly dried, will keep good for six months; 
if these two precautions are. not properly 
attended to, it will become sour in ten days. 

MARIGOLDS, CONSERVE OF. Take 
(bur ounces of marigold-flowers, conserve of 
hyacinth and hermes, of each four drachms, 
the powder of pearl two ounces, and as 
much sirup of citron as will make them into 
a conserve, mixing and bruising them to- 
gether with refined sugar. 

MARJORAM CONSERVE. Take 

the tops and tenderest part of sweet marjo- 
ram, bruise it well in a wooden mortar or 
bowl; take double its weight of fine sugar, 
boil it with marjoram-water till it is as 
thick as sirup, then put in your beaten mar- 
joram. 

MARSEILLES, OR GINGER. Take 

a pound and a half of double-refined sugar, 
and boil it to fort souffle, add to it an 
ounce of ginger in powder, remove the pan 
from the fire, and with a round stick (like 
a plain round rule) stir the sugar, inclining 
the stick towards the sides of the pan, then 
with a spoon take the sugar that sticks to 
the edges and put it amongst the liquid, then 
work it up again with the stick, remove the 
solid sugar as l*fore, and repeat this opera- 
tion tour times,, when it will have become tole- 
rably thick and firm ; pour it into paper cases, 
about half an inch thick, and with a fork 
trace on its surface, whilst warm, lozenges 
of what size you please; afterwards, with 
the point of a knife, mark some of these 
deeper than the others; when quite cold, 
take them out of the papers, and separate 
them, where the lines are deepest. The 
Marseilles, if preserved in a warm or dry 
place, will keep good for a long time. 

MARSEILLES SPICED. Take a 
|xuind and a half of fine sugar, boil it to 
caste; take a quarter of preserved orange- 
peel, the same of candied lcmon-|icel, (or, 
if you like it better, two ounces of blanched 
pistachio nuts), cut them into dice, and put 
them with half an ounce of cloves, the same 
of cinnamon (Ixilh pounded) into the sugar, 
stir them in gently, continue to boil your 
sirup to forte plume; then lx?at it up, pour 
it into i a.-e.-, and finish as the Marseilles. 

MI'.l.o.NS, TO PRESERVE LIKE 
< I V 1 1 .U. Half a |xniinl of ginger to one 
pound of melon; scrape the ginger, and 
save the scraping*; pour a quart of boiling

MYR 



water on the ginger, let it stand two days: 
scald the melon (with the scrapings of the 
ginger in the water), t:iking care not to 
make it too soft: cut it into small pieces 
resembling ginger; then prepare a simp, 
half a pound of sugar to a pint of water; 
boil the ginger in it; when cold, put in the 
melon, and set it over the fire for a short 
time, but not to boil; let the sirup, with 
the ginger, be boiled every day for a fort- 
night, but not poured upon the melon till 
nearly cold; then boil a rich sirup to keep 
it in. 

N. B. Carrot is equally good with melon. 

MERINGUES. (1) Whisk the whites of 
nine eggs to a solid froth; then add the rind 
of six lemons, grated extremely fine, and a 
spoonful of silted sugar; after which, lay a 
sheet of wet paper on a tin, and with a 
spoon drop the mixture in little lumps, 
separately upon it, sift sugar over, and put 
them to "take in a moderately heated oven, 
taking care that they are done of a nice 
color. Then put raspl>erry, apricot, or any 
other kind of jam lietween two of these bot- 
toms, add them together, and lay them in 
a warm place, or before the fire to dry. 

MERINGUES. (2) Take the whites 
of twelve eggs, six ounces of the best lump 
sugar, pounded and sifled, and half a pound 
of pistachios; blanch and beat the latter in 
a mortar, with a little while of egg, to a 
very fine paste. Whl.sk the whites of eggs 
to a snow, then add the sugar, and pista- 
chio paste, mix them well, but very lightly, 
and when they are thoroughly incorporated, 
put some sheets of paper ifn tin plates, lay 
your preparation on the pa|>er, with a spoon, 
lay the meringues, at least an inch apart; 
sprinkle sifted sugar over them, and put 
them into a moderate oven or stove ; when 
done, detach them gently from the paper 
with a knife, and place them on a sieve in 
a dry place. Just before they are sent to 
table, fill each with a little whipped cream, 
to which add a small quantity of either 
orange-flower, rose, or vanilla water. 

MILK PUNCH. Pare six oranges, and 
six lemons, as thin as you possibly can, 
grate them after with sugar to obtain the 
flavor. Steep the peels in a bottle of rum 
or brandy, stopped close for four and twenty 
hours. Squeeze the fruit on two pounds of 
migar, add four quarts of water to it, and 
one quart of new milk, boiling hot; stir the 
rum into the above, and run it through a 
jelly-bag until it is quite clear: bottle and 
cork it close immediately. 

MINT, DISTILLED LIQUEUR OF. 
Take two handfuls of fresh gathered garden 



f mint, and infuse it for some days in a gallon 
and a half of brandy, and a quart of water ; 
then distil it as usual. Dissolve three 
pounds and a half of sugar in seven pints of 
water, mix the sirup with the liqueur, and 
run the whole through a jelly bag. 

MINT WATER. Take four pounds of 
dried mint, two gallons and a half of proof 
spirits, and three gallons of water; distil 
them, and sweeten the water with a pound 
and a half of sugar. 

MIRLITONS. Put into a pan two 
yolks, and two whole eggs, four ounces of 
powder-sugar, three ounces of sweet maca- 
roons crushed, half an ounce of crisped 
orange-flowers in powder, and a grain of 
salt; stir these together a minute, then add 
two ounces of melted butter; whip the two 
whites very firm, and put them also to the 
preparation. Line thirty tartlet moulds with 
puff-paste, into each of which pour an equal 
quantity of the above; cover them with 
sifted sugar, and when that is di.->i>lved, 
strew over a little sugar, a la grele; and 
put them into a moderate oven : serve eithet 
hot or cold. 

MULBERRIES, SIRUP OF. Take 

as many mulberries as will yielil three pints 
of juice, which put into a preserving pan 
with three pints of water; boil until this 
quantity is reduced to one pint; then lay the 
fruit on a sieve to drain. Clarify throe 
pounds of sugar, boil it to bouille; then add 
the mulberry -juice; give them one boil, and 
skim them. Pour the sirup into a pan, and 
let it stand ; when col.l, bottle it. 

MUSK, TO PREPARE FOR LI- 
QUEURS. Take two grains of musk and 
a quarter of a pound of sugar, pound them 
in a mortar and mix them well; keep it in 
a closely stopped bottle. The quantity re- 
quired of this is one pinch to four or five 
quarts of liqueur. Amliergris is prepared 
in a similar manner, but being less powerful 
than the musk, four grains is the proportion 
to a quarter of a pound of sugar. 

MYRTLE, OIL OF. Put two ounces 
of peach leaves, and the half of a nutmeg, 
bruised, into six quarts of brandy; distil 
from this in a bain marie alembic your li- 
queur, in which, infuse half a pound of myr- 
tle flowers for four days. Dissolve five 
pounds of sugar in three quarts of pure river 
water; the moment it begins to boil, take it 
from the fire, and let it cool; take the myr- 
tle flowers from the liqueur, and put in the 
sugar ; mix them well, color it with tincture 
of saffron, strain and bottle it.

troduction of the various coloring materials 
into the sugar with which they are cov- 
ered. 

NOUGAT. Blanch and wash a pound 
.ilinonds, and having drained them 
well, rut each into tive slips, which place in 
a gentle oven to dry ; let them be all equally 
coloii-d of a clear y< How; in tile meantime, 
put three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar 
into a preserving pan, set it on a stove,

days in the gin, (hen filler it through blotting 
paper, and bottle it. 

M T BONBONS. Boil a pound of 
Spani.-h nuts; when they are well boiled, 
rub off their skin with a napkin, if some 
stick too hard, pare it off with a knife; 
nr nuts very fine on a sheet of pa- 
|.er ; then take a pound of powdered sugar 
to a pound of nuts, put it in a pun over a 
slow fire; when your sugar is all melted 
( yii must stir it constantly with a wooden 
E|xx>n) put your nuts in, and work them well 
till all is well mixed, and pour it upon a tin 
plate; then spread it with a rolling pin, this 
must be done very quickly, as it cools very 
fast ; when it is cold, cut it into what form 
you please ; you must take care the sugar is 
not loo much melted, for it is very apt to 
soften when die nuts are added to it. 

N I TS PRALLNED. Take a pound 
of Spanish nuts, take them out of their 
shells, and put them into a pan, with a 
pound of loaf sugar, and a little water; let 
them boil till they begin to sparkle; then 
take them off tlie fire, and stir them well 
with a wooden spoon, till you perceive tlie 
sugar turns gravelly; then set them again 



over a slow fire, to dissolve tlie sugar; keep 
stirring, that the sugar may stick to (he nuts, 
and when you see them turn reddish, and 
are well covered with sugar, take them off, 
pour tin-in into a sieve, cover them with a 
clean cloth, and put them into a stove; this 
will preserve their gloss. 

NUTMEGS TO CANDY. Take a 

pound and a half of double refined sugar, 
half a quarter of a pint of damask rose-wa-

ing articles to an impalpable, powder: an 
ounce of skirrel seeds, an ounce of caraway 
seeds, an ounce of anise seeds, a drachm 
and a half of mace, and the rind of an or- 
.nr..-e; infuse these for five days in a gallon 
of brandy, then distil from it in a bain ma- 
rie, two quarts of liqueur; dissolve over 
tlie fire four pounds of sugar in two quarts 
of pure water; when cold, mix it with the 
distilled liquevr, and color it of a clear yel- 
low, with a little tincture of saffron; filler 
and bottle it ; seal (he corks. 

ORANGES IN BRANDY. Choose 
the oranges very round and smooth, pare, 
prick tin-in in the middle, and put them into 
cold water; then blanch them in boiling 
water; when tliey are tender, throw them 
anain into cold water; in a short time give 
them ne\en or eight boils in sugar, a la pe- 
tite nappe, skim, and let them stand till 
next day, when the same process must be 
gone through; skim them again, then put 
(hem into hollies, pour over them equal 
quantities of sirup and water; lake care to 
cork them well.

ORA 



ORANGE, COMPOTE. Cut them 
in small pieces, and boil them !n wa- 
ter until they are tender, then change them 
into cold water; next make a simp with 
one glass of water and four ounces of sugar, 
and put in the fruit; let it simmer gently 
over a slow fire for half an hour ; serve cold. 

ORANGE, CROQUE EN BOU- 
CHES OF. Pare a dozen fine oranges, 
and divide each into twelve pieces, all of 
the same size ; scrape off every particle of 
the white, without breaking the thin skin 
which contains the juice ; when all are done, 
dip each piece into some sugar boiled to 
casse (and lightly colored,) and place them 
in a plain mould of six inches diameter, and 
five in height ; the first row inclined one way, 
the second the reverse way, and so on ; lay 
them at the bottom in a slar. As soon as 
the mould is full, turn it out, and serve it 
with all possible expedition, as the moisture 
of the fruit dissolves the sugar so rapidly, 
that the croque en bouche is liable to fall 
to pieces. 

ORANGE CAKES. Divide the or- 
anges in half, take out the seeds, and put 
the pulp and juice into a basin ; boil the 
rinds in a saucepan of water, closely cover- 
ed; when very tender take them out, and 
dry them upon a cloth ; allow to a pound of 
orange rinds, two of pounded loaf sugar; 
pound the rinds in a mortar; add by degrees 
the sugar, and then the juice and pulp; mix 
it thoroughly till thick and yellow, drop it 
upon tins in small cakes, and dry them un- 
der garden glasses, or in a cool oven. If 
it be too thick to drop, let it stand a night. 

ORANGE SHERBET. Dissolve a 
pound and half of sugar in a quart of very 
pure water; take nine fine oranges and two 
lemons; wipe them well with a napkin, and 
having grated the most fragrant rinds, squeeze 
on them the juice of these fruits; sweeten 
this juice with the above sirup, run the whole 
through a close hair sieve, and finish in 
the usual way. (See Sherbet.) 

ORANGE SHRUB. Put ten pounds 
of crushed sugar to two gallons of water, 
and boil it until the sugar be dissolved ; skim 
it well, and put it into a tub; when quite 
cold, pour it into a barrel ; add three quarts 
of Jamaica rum, and six quarts of orange- 
juice (take care there are no pips.) Beat 
up the white of an egg, mix it with the 
shrub, and let it stand for a week ; then 
draw it off* and bottle it. 

ORANGE SUGAR. Rasp on a piece 
of sugar the rinds of the l>est oranges, but 
so lightly that not a particle of tlie white is 



mixed with it; scrape off the surface of tlie 
sugar as it Incomes colored, and continue 
this operation until you have as much sugar 
as you require; then lay it in a stove, or at 
tlie mouth of the oven to dry ; when it is 
perfectly so, pass it through a very fine 
sieve. Lemons and cedrats may be grated, 
and the sugar dried in the same manner. 

9RANGES, GREEN. Scrape out the 
insides of the oranges quite clean, then let 
them lie for three days in cold water, chang- 
ing the water daily, then boil them very 
slowly till the water is bitter; then put 
them into other boiling water, set them by; 
repeating this daily till all the bitterness is 
extracted: make a rich sirup of the last 
water they are boiled in, with Lisbon sugar; 
when cold, put them in; the next day boil 
them in the sirup; repeat this till they are 
green and tender; cover with brandy-paper. 

ORANGE, WATER ICE. Take off 
the rind of two Seville oranges, very fine 
and thin ; squeeze the juice into a basin 
with one lemon ; add half a pint of sirup, 
and half a pint of water; pass diem through 
a sieve, and freeze them rich. 

ORANGE-FLOWER CONSERVE. 

Boil half a pound of clarified sugar to grande 
plume, take it from the fire, and pour into 
it a dessert spoonful of orange-Mower water; 
stir them together well, set the mixture on 
the fire, and when warm, pour it into shal- 
low paper-cases; let it cool, and then cut it 
into cakes of any form you please. 

ORANGE-FLOWER PASTILS. Pul- 
verise a good pinch of dried orange-flowers; 
pound them with gum-dragon, previously 
dissolved in one glass of plain, and the 
same quantity of orange-flower water; add 
a sufficient proportion of powder-sugar, to 
make the paste of the requisite consistence, 
which form according to your taste into 
cones, lozenges, &c. 

ORANGE-FLOWER PRALINES. 

Take a pound of very fresh white orange- 
flowers, pick, and throw them into cold 
water; clarify, and boil two pounds of sugar 
to touffle, then put in the flowers; stir 
them with a spatula, until your sugar re- 
gains the degree of souffle; take the pan 
from the fire, and continue stirring till the 
sugar is separated from the (lowers, and be- 
comes a powder; set it in a stove to dry, 
then set the whole on a sieve, that the sugar 
may run through and leave the flowers, 
which put into bottles. If preserved in a 
dry place they will keep for twelve months.

ify and boil four pounds of sugar to perle, 
then add three-<|u;irters of a pound of frcsli 
orange-flowers picked, and lx>il them once; 
then take the pan from the fire, and let it 
eland for two hour.-', after which, replace, it 
on the fire ; when it has had aliout a dozen 
boilings, pour it through a sieve into anoth- 
er saucepan, boil the sirup to line, and 
put it aside; when quite cold, bottle it. 
The flowers may l>e used as follows: put 
ihein into jxiwder-sugar, with which nib 
them well with your hands, till quite dry, 
then sift and put them in a stove. 

<:I:AN<;F.-FLOWER WATER. Pm 

in!.' a still ten pounds of fresh gathered or- 
ange-flouers, and six quarts of pure river 
water; lake particular care to close up all 
the apertures of the still perfectly, and set it 
on a moderate tire, that the ebullition may 
not be too strong ; be particular in cooling 
it fn-qtieiitly, or, at least, whenever the wa- 
ter in the boiler becomes too warm, change 
it, and put in fresh; much depends on the 
attention paid to this part of the operation. 
From the above quantity, three quarts of 
Orange-Bower water may !* drawn. 

ORANGE-FLOWER DOUBLE 
WATER. Draw four quarts of orange- 
flovver water from six quarts distilled as 
above; put to this water the ?ame quantity 
of fresh (lowers, distil it in the same manner, 
and it will yield five pints. 

ORANGE PEEL TO CANDY. Take 

some orange peel, and let it soak in .-ive- 
ral waters till it has lost its bitten 
lioil it in a solution of double-refined su- 
gar in water, till it becomes tender and 

tiansjjarent. 

ORANGE PEEL TO PRESEUVK. 

Cut the oranges in halves, take out the pulp, 
put the peel in strong salt and spring water, 
to soak for three days, repeat this three 
times, then put them on a sieve to dry; 
take one pound of loaf sugar, add to it one 
quart of spring water, lx>il it, skim it until 
quite clear; let tlie peels simmer until they 
are quite trans|Kiivni; dry them before the 
fire; take loaf-sugar, with just sufficient 
water to dissolve it; whilst the sugar is 
boiling, put in the peels, stirring continually 
until all the sugar is candied round them, 
then put them to dry either before the fire 
or in an oven, and when |>crfectly dried, 
put them by for use. 

ORGEAT. Blanch a pound of sweet, 
and twenty-four bitter almonds ; pound them 
to an exceedingly fine paste, adding water 
25 



occasionally to prevent their oiling ; mix a 
gallon of water, two pounds of sugar and 
orange-flower water, with this paste; beat 
them together for some time ; then strain it 
two or three times through a jully-bag, stir- 
ring it with a spatula, and serve it in de- 
canters. 

ORGEAT PASTE. Pound the almonds 
with a little orange-flower water to a fine 
paste, and Uien work up with it an equal 
weight of powder-sugar. This paste uill 
keep a long while, and by dissolving a small 
portion of it in water, and straining it, or- 
geat may be prepared very quickly. An 
ounce of the paste is sufficient for half a 
pint of water. 

ORGEAT SIRUP. Take a pound and 

a half of sweet, and half a pound of bitter 
almonds, throw them into boiling water, and 
leave them till the skins ean be removed 
with ease, then throw them into cold water 
for a minute before you blanch them, after 
which, they must again lie put into cold 
water; then pound them, a few at a time, 
in a marble mortar, adding occasionally 
some water to prevent their oiling ; when 
all are beaten to a very fine paste, dilute this 
with the greater |iarl of a quart of water, 
(of which reserve six ounces) ; put the 
paste into a Strong cloth; squee/.e am! wring 
out all the milk from the almonds, put the 
latter into (he mortar, and pound them 
again, adding by degrees the remainder of 
the water, and then squeeze these also in a 
cloth ; |xmr the whole of this milk into a 
nougli to contain, at least, 
one-third more liquid, add to it two pounds 
of lump-sugar, and a pint of orange-flower 
water; cork the matrass tight, and set it 
on a bain marie; wlien die sugar is com- 
pletely dissolved, (which should be accelera- 
ted b\ .-hakins tht! matrass occasionally), les- 
sen the fire by degrees, and as soon as the 
r <]ite cold, put the sirup into bottles. 

If yon should have no matrass, you may 
make your sirup in the following manner: 
boil the above mentioned quantity of sugar 
to forte plume, then add the milk of al- 
monds, and as soon as it has boiled up twice, 
take it from the fire; when cold, flavor it 
with a pint of orange-flower water. 

Or this sirup may be made in a still more 
simple way, 'as thus: put the milk of al- 
moinis into some pounded sugar, without 
lieing clarified or boiled previously; when 
the simp !>egins to boil, add alxmt a coflfee- 
cupful of orange-flower water, and after it 
has boiled tip two or three times, take it 
from the fire; let it get quite cold before 
you bottle it. Keep it well corked.

PARFAIT AMOUR. Take four very 
fine fresh cedrats, p;ire them very thin, and 
infuse them with half an ounce of fine cinna- 
mon, and four ounces of coriander, in three 
gallons of strong brandy, and a quart of wa- 
ter, for a week or ten days, when distil it 
in the bain marie; this quantity of brandy, 
if good, will yield two gallons and half a 
pint of spirit. Dissolve three pounds and a 
half of sugar in seven pints of river water, 
color it with cochineal, then add it to the 
spirit, filter, and bottle it. 

PASTILLES. To make these articles, 
it is necessary to have a small copper stew- 
pan that will hold about a pint, rather deep 
than wide, with a pointed lip on die right 
side, and a tolerably long handle, also two 
pieces of wood, one about eighteen inches 
long, and four in diameter, called the bois 
a tabeller, the other about half the length, 
one inch in diameter, and the lower emi, 
pointed so that it will exactly fit the lip of 
the pan ; this is called the bois a egoutter; 
six or eight tin plates about the size of a 
sheet of letter-paper. 

For the best pastilles, take a pound of 
double-refined sugar reduced to an impalpa- 
ble powder; sift it through a tammy on a 
sheet of white paper, put four or five spoon- 
fuls of this sugar into your pan, pour on it a 
little orange-flower water, and beat it well 
with the larger stick, until the preparation 
is sufficiently thin to run from the stick 
without being clear; if it be so, more sugar 
must be added. Put the pan over a chafing- 
dish filled with live coals, and let it stand 
(stirring constantly) till it boils; then take 
it off I he chafing-d'ish, add two more spoon- 
fuls of sugar, work it up well, scrape away 
whatever sugar adheres to the stick, set it 
aside, and take the smaller stick in your 
right hand, hold the pan in your left (slant- 
ing) over one of the tin-plates; the sugar 
will, by these means, flow to the lip, then 
strike the point of the stick into the lip of 
the pan, which action will separate the 
liquid, so that each time the stick strikes 
the lip a single drop of the preparation will 
fall on the tin; a little practice will be ne- 
cessarv before this operation can be perform- 
ed neatly. As soon as all your sugar, &c. 
is used," replenish the pan and proceed as 
above directed, until you have as many 
pastilles as you may require. When cold 
and hard, remove them from the tins with 
your hand, and keep them in boxes in a 
dry place. You may, if you please, color 
the pastilles, taking care to perfume them 
with a corresponding odour. 



PASTILLES, COMMON. These are 
made in the same manner as the best sort, 
the difference consists in the materials, 
(which are a quarter of a pound of powder 
to three-quarters of a pound of sugar) and 
the perfumes are omitted . 

PASTILLAGES. Put two ounces of 
well-washed gum dragon into an earthen 
pan, with as much clear hot water as will 
cover it, lay a sheet of paper to keep out 
the dust, and let it stand twenty-four hours ; 
then squeeze it through a coarse cloth into 
a marble mortar, and add to it as much 
starch ;uid sugar (both in powder) as the 
gum water will contain ; |xtmid these ingre- 
dients well, and strain them through a tammy 
into a pan which keep covered with a damp 
cloth. This pastillage is used to form the 
ornamental parts of pastry and confection- 
ary, such as temples, baskets, &c., and may 
be tinged of the requisite shades, by mix- 
ing with it any of the coloring materials. 

PEACHES IN A COMPOTE. Cut 

your peaches in half, t.^ke out the stones, 
peel them, then set them on the fire in a 
sugar-pan, with a sufficient quantity of thick 
clarified sugar to cover them, and let them 
simmer in this gently till done; then take 
them out in a basin, put in the kernels to 
the sugnr, and let it boil until tolerably thick ; 
put in the juice of two or three lemons, and 
pour the sirup over the peaches; serve them 
in a deep hot dish. 

PEARS IN BRANDY. Take some 
beurre pears, not too ripe, put them into a 
saucejxtn with a smTicient quantity of water 
to cover them, set them on the fire, and let 
them .simmer, but not boil, until the pears 
will yield to the pressure of your finger; 
then change them into cold water; pare 
them with the greatest care, so that not a 
single spot may remain ; prick, and put them 
again on the fire in fresh water and the juice 
of a lemon; let them boil very fast. As 
soon as tle pears are soft enough for the 
head of a pin to penetrate them easily, take 
them out carefully with a skimmer, and lay 
them in cold water. In the meantime, hav- 
ing boiled your sugar to lisse, pour the 
boiling sirup on the pears, (previously 
drained from the water,) and leave them. 
The next day drain off the sirup, boil it to 
la nappe, then put in the pears, give them 
a boil also; proceed in die same manner on 
the third day, after which, drain die fruk, 
and put it into bottles. Boil up the sirup a 
few more times, let it cool, and then ^>our 
on it some brandy, (three-fourths of die 
quantity of the sirup;) run die mixture 
through a bag, put it to the pears, and cork 
the bottles well.

lender, U-at it through with a wooden pe.-tle 

into a preMrving-pan, which set on the fire, 

to dry the pulp, -tii riiu i' constantly. In 
the meantime, clarify ;uid IMIJ! the -uyar to 
petit caste, then mix it with the fruit (.-till

be boiled once or twice before they are 
pressed through the cullender. Some of 
the kernels may be added, if approved; 
they should be pounded before putting in the 
marmalade. 

PLUMS PRESERVED, DRY. Gath- 
er die plums when full grown and just turn- 
ing color, pi ick and put them into a saucepan 
of cold water, set them on the fire until the 
water is on the point of boiling; then take 
them out, drain and boil them well in some 
clarified sugar, let them settle, and then boil 
diem again ; if they shrink and will not take 
the sugar, prick them as they lay in the pan, 
and then give them another boil, Siiim and 
set them by: the next day, add some more 
sugar, boiled to souffle, to the fruit, and 
sirup, then do them together; place them 
in a stove till next day, when drain the 
plums from the sirup, sprinkle a little pow- 
der-sugar over, and dry them in a stove. 

PLUMS, PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Gather the plums green, firm, and when the 
etone may be extracted with ease, cut the 
Btalks close, and prick the fruit in several 
places, especially round the stalk ; then 
place them in a saucepan of water over the 
fire, and as soon as the water is ready to 
boil, take the saucepan from the fire ; in 
four-and-twenty hours, replace the plums in 
the same water on a gentle fire, with a small 
quantity of verjuice to preserve their color. 
Keep the water hot, without allowing it to 
boil, for three hours, stirring it occasional- 
ly ; when the fruit is perfectly green, increase 
die heat till the plums rise to the surface, 
when they must be taken out and thrown 
into cold water, which change frequently till 
die plums are perfectly cold, then drain 
diem. Put the fruit in some sugar boiled to 
la nappe, boil them up a few times, adding 
a little water; skim, and dien pour the 
whole into a pan ; the next two days, drain 
off the sirup, and increase the degree of 
boiling each day ; the third and fourth days, 
boil die fruit with the sirup, keeping them 
covered, and increasing the degree, until the 
last time, it reaches to perle. Put the 
preserve into pots, and place them for two 
days in a stove. 

The same fruit may be preserved dry 
also. The operation is die same, but die 
sirup is drained off, and die plums laid on 
tin plates before they are put into die stove. 

POMEGRANATE CLEAR CAKES. 

Pare some good boiling apples, and put them 
into a saucepan with as much water as will 
cover them, set them on the fire, and when 
perfectly soft, press the pulp through a sieve, 
and then strain it. Boil diis jelly with the 



juice of two or diree pomegranates, diat of 
one orange, and one lemon, and the rind of 
each grated; strain it again, and to every 
pound of jelly add a pound and a quarter 
of fine sugar, boiled till it cracks, color it 
with cochineal; pour it into glasses (taking 
off die scum before it becomes cold). Set 
them in a stove, and when the top is dry, 
turn them out, and put them to dry again; 
then cut diem into whatever forms you 
please, put them into the stove or oven to 
harden, then lay them on sieves, and wlien 
thoroughly dry, place diem in boxes widi 
paper between. As they are apt to become 
moist, diey should be looked at frequently. 

POMEGRANATE JELLY, TRANS- 
PARENT. Take the seeds from five 
very fine pomegranates, from which extract 
the juice by pressing it hard through a 
horse-hair sieve ; filter this juice and mix it 
with some sirup tinged of a rose color, will) 
a little cochineal; add the isinglass to this, 
and finish as usual. (See Jelly Fruit.) 

POMEGRANATE SIRUP. Take 

five very ripe large pomegranates, extract 
the seeds (which must be very red) ; crush, 
and put them into a skillet, with half a 
pint of water; set diein on the fire till soft, 
and then squeeze the juice through a new 
coarse cloth ; clarify a pound and half of 
sugar, and boil it to souffle, then add die 
juice, boil them together to the usual con- 
sistence of simps. It must not be bottled 
until quite cold. This number of pome- 
granates will yield a quart of sirup. 

POUPELIN. Put into a saucepan (bur 
glasses of water, a quarter of a pound of 
butter, die zette of a lemon, and a pinch 
of fine salt; set it on the fire, and as soon 
as it begins to boil, take it off, and put in 
as much sifted flour as will make a paste 
the consistence of choux, then replace it 
on the fire, and keep stirring till it dries; 
make a similar mixture, and when that 
also is dry, put both into a mortar, with 
half a pound of powder sugar, an ounce of 
orange-flowers, and two eggs at a time, un- 
til five and twenty or thirty are used, by 
which time the paste will l>e of the proper 
consistence, then pour it into a lightly but-

R AS I'l JERRIES OF M ARCH PANE. 

Take a piiimd of marcli|Kinc, the juice of 
four lemons, a quarter of a pound of rasp- 
berry jellv, and a little cochineal; mix these 

with a strong wooden spatula ; then 
add two handfuls of lloiir, and sonn- powdet 
Fugar: when well worked up, roll them into 

Unit the size of a linger, cut these 
into dice, roll each into a ball, pinch the 
top into a |K)int, so a.s to resemble the firm 

lierry: then put them one by one 
into pa; liich pi ice in a dry 

warm place, for eight or ten days. At the 
end of that time, put a jxnti >n of .sirup of 
rasplxTrics, a little cochineal, and a small 
quantity of powder-sug:ir into a pan; mix 

ether with a s|.-oou, and then throw 
into it a couple of liandfnls of the raspber- 
ries; take the pun in both hands, and shake 
it abniii, so that the rasplx-rrics may Ix- 
equally covered with tiie red simp; then 

r a la grele on a large .-licet of 

..read it out a little, and while the 
raspberries arc wet wiih the sirup, throw

them into the sugar; then take the four 
corners of the paper, shake it about well, 
by which means the sugar will adhere to 
the raspberries in all parts, and give them 
a (xrfect resemblance to the real fruit ; take 
them out carefully one by one, lay them on 
paper, and put them in a warm place for 
some days. These artificial raspberries are 
of a pleasant flavor, and will keep several 
years. 

RASPBERRY MARMALADE. Take 
double tfte weight of raspberriee to that of 
sugar. Rub the fruit through a sieve, and 
put the pulp into a saucepan; set it on die 
fire, and stir till it is reduced to half ; then 
jKiur on the sugar, previously clarified and 
boiled to petit boule, stir it well in, put it 
on the fire, give it a few boils, and then 
pour it into pots. 

RASPP.ERRIES PRESERVED. Take 

(i\e or six pounds of red, but not loo ripe 
rasplierries, pick, and put them into a pre- 
serving pan, with an equal weight of clari- 
fied sugar, Ixiiled to petit boule; when 
they have boiled up about a dozen times, 
skim, and pour the whole into a pan till the 
next day, then drain the fruit, and put it 
int. i jars; put to the sirup about two glass- 
es uf cherry juice, previously strained; boil 
the sugar to la nappt, and then pour it 
over the raspljerries ; add afterwards, about 
a s|x>onful of currant jelly to each pot, and 
when cold, lay on branJy papers, and tie 
them down. 

RATAFIA OF FOUR FRUITS. Tak5 

ten pounds of very ripe cherries, two pounds 
and a half of raspberries, five pounds and a 
half of red and two pounds of black cur- 
rant-; pick, and mix these fruits together, 
press the juice from them, measure it, and 
for every quart of juice, take half a pound 
of sugar, and an equal quantity of brandy; 
dissolve the sugar in the juice, then put in 
the brandy, a drachm of mace, and two 
drachms of cloves. Let the whole stand 
some time, filter, and bottle it. Keep them 
well corked. 

K< )S ES, CANDIED. Crisp two hand- 
fills of rose-lcau-s in some clarified sugar, 
boil them tu fort toitffle, then lake the pan 
from the fire, pour it on a sieve, let tlie sir- 
up run from the leaves, nibbing the latter in 
your hands, then dry them in a sto\e. 15oil 
your sugar again to' souffle, adding a litUe 
carmine to color it, have a pi<|ii mould 
ready, ]M>ur the .-n^ar into it, and put the 
(lowers on il, push them down lightly with 
u fork, that they may Ije compleu 
ed with the sugar; place the mould in a 
moderate glove or oven for five days, then

drain off the sirup ; lay a sheet of paper on 
the table, and turn the candy quickly out 
of the mould. 

ROSES, CONSERVE OF. Boil half 
a pound of sugar to fort souffle, pour into 
this sirup the best double-distilled rose 
water; Iwil it again to fort perle, mix 
with it a little prepared cochineal or car- 
mine to color it, and pour your conserve 
into moulds. 

ROSE RED DROPS. Take a small 
quantity of red bastard saffron, and a little 
calcined alum, boil those in some water until 
it is sufficiently tinged for your purpose ; 
then filter or strain it through a very close 
linen cloth; put five or six spoonfuls of sift- 
ed sugar into the pan, dilute it with the 
colored water, work it well with the bois a 
tabeller, and set it over a chafing-dish ; when 
it begins to boil, add two more spoonfuls 
of sugar, and having worked it well, per- 
fume it with some drops of essence of roses, 
and finish as directed. (See Orange-flow- 
er Drops.) 

ROSSOLS. Take three-quarters of a 
pound of picked orange-flowers, a pound 
of musk roses, six drachms of cinnamon, 
and two of cloves (lx>th bruised); put them 
into a cucurbite with three gallons of pure 
water; on distilling this, it will yield a gal- 
lon and a half, in which dissolve twelve 
pounds of fine sugar broken up; add to it 
an equal quantity of spirit of jessamine, col- 
or it crimson with cochineal, filter and bot- 
tle it. 



S. 



SEEDS, SUGARED. These are done 
in the same manner as sugared almonds. 
The seeds most generally used for this pur- 
pose are anise, cummin, and fennel. 

The l>est method of proceeding is as fol- 
lows: place a small preserving-pan over a 
charcoal fire, on the side of which have a 
chafing dish, on which keep a pan with a 
quantity of sugar boiled to lisse; (this su- 
gar should be kept quite hot, but not boil- 
ing) ; on the other side have some fine pow- 
der. When so far prepared, put your seeds 
into the pan, and as soon as they begin to 
heat, pour over them a large spoonful or 
two of the sirup; stir them alxnit, that all 
may be thoroughly saturated with it; then 
sprinkle over it a handful or two of powder, 
still shaking the pan to make the seeds 
equally white. When dry, pour on some 
more simp, then the powder, and continue 
this alternately until your seeds are suf- 



ficiently largo; thon lay them on a sieve, 
keep them in a warm place for some days, 
after which put them into glass bottles. 

SOUFFLE FRANCAIS. Blake a 
croustade eleven inches in diameter, and 
three and three-quarters in height ; put 
round it three sheets of buttered paper, and 
bake it. 

Take twelve glasses of boiling milk, in 
which infuse whatever ingredients you may 
think pro|x-r, such as vanilla, coffee, orange- 
flowers, kc. (the proportions will be found 
under the different articles). In the mean- 
time, wash a pound of rice thoroughly in 
warm water, then put it into a saucepan 
of cold water, and when it has Ixiilod a few 
minutes, strain the rice, and put it with 
vout infusion into another saucepan, and 
set it again on the fire; as soon as it boils, 
place the saucepan on hot ashes, that the 
rice may burst gradually ; in three-quarters 
of an hour, add a pound of powder-sugar, 
three-quartet's of a pound of fresh butter, 
and a pinch of salt, stir them well in; put 
fresh hot ashes under the saucepan, that the 
rice mav be kept constantly simmering for 
an hour, by which time it ought to be per- 
fectly soft, and should lie nibbed through a 
bolting-cloth quickly, like a puree; put this 
into another saucepan over hot ashes, U> 
keep it warm. Take sixteen fifgs, sepa- 
rate the yolks and whites, lx?at the former 
well, and whisk the latter till nearly firm; 
then mix the yolks with the rice (taking 
off the ashes,) ; the preparation ought to lie 
of the same consistence as a cream palis- 
siere; add, at first, a quarter, and after- 
wards the whole of the whites; stir them in 
as lightly as for biscuit paste; the whole be- 
ing thoroughly amalgamated, pour it into 
the croustade, and place it in a moderate 
oven for two hours and a half; when done, 
cover a baking tin with red cinders, on 
which place the souffle the moment it is 
taken out of the oven; this prevents its 
falling^ whilst you mask it with powder- 
sugar, and glaze with the salamander; car- 
ry it into the* dining-room on a tin, have a 
dish ready with a napkin folded on it; 
place the souffle on the dish, and let it be 
served immediately. Remember that a 
souffle cannot be served too quickly. 

STRAWBERRY, COMPOTE OF. 
This is made in the same manner as Rasp- 
berries, only that the stnuvlxrries do not 
require being mixed with any other fruit. 

STRAWBERRY CONSERVE. Take 
some very ripe fresh strawberries, pick, and 
crush them through a tammy. For every 
dessert spoonful of juice, allow six ounces 
of sugar ; boil this to fort perle, take it

the pin and the skimmer with a 
water, which put to the scum, and set it 
aside lor more common purposes. 

A U, Different Degree* of Pre- 
paring. The various pur|xis<* to which 
applied, require it t<i Ix- in dilTeix-nt 
'hese are called degree*, and are 
thirl' i-ii in luimlx-r, called as follow-: 

Petit Lisse, or First Degree. Re- 
place the clarified -u^ar iii the p:- 
pan, to lx>il gently, take a drop of it on the 
thuml), touch it with the tore linger; if, on 
opening them, it dr.iw.- to a tine tin 
in breaking, forms two drops on each liu_'i r, 
it is at the right point. 



Liise, Second Degree. A little more 
boiling briii.'s it to this |x>int; when the 
thread will draw further N-l'ore it breaks. 

Petit Perle, Third Degree. At thia 
point the thread may lie drawn as far aa the 
spin will open, without hn-akin^. 

Grand Perle, Fourth Degree. Oo 
still increasing the Ixiiling, little raised balls 
an- lormed on tlie surface of the.-! j 

Petit Queue de Cockon, Fifth Degree. 
Take up some of the suijar on a skimmer, 
and drop it on the rest, when it should form 
a slanting streak on the .-nrlace. Boil it a 
little Liimer, and it will reach the 

(trn.ide Queue de Cochon, or Sixth 
Degree. The streak or tail is now larger. 

Souffle, Seventh Degree. Take out a 
skimmeifi'l of the siiiiar, blow through it, 
and small spaiks of sn^-ir will fly from it. 

J'ltit-J'lume, Eighth Degree. The 
same proof as above; the sparks should be 
larger and stronger. 

iiraade Plume, Ninth Degree. Take 
the sugar in the skimmer, as U-tore, give it 
a shake, and if the sparks are large, and 
adhere together on rising, it is at the right 
point. 

Ptlit Botilet, Tenth Degree. Dip 
your lingers in cold water, and tlien into 
instantly, and again into the wa- 
ter, when the sugar will roll into a ball, 
which will IN- supple when cold. 

(Vros Boulet, Eleventh Degree. At 
tin- point, the ball or bullet will be harder 
when cold than at the last. 

Caste, Twelfth Degree. Prove as 
above; the bullet should crumble between 
the fingers, and on biting, will stick to the 
teeth ; at the next [xiint, 

Caramel, Thirteenth Degree, It 
should snap clean. This point is very diffi- 
cult to attain, for in increasing the height, 
the .-ugar is apt to burn; it is better there- 
fore to try tlie proof \ery fiei|tiently. 

Another caramel is frei|iientK used bv the 
confectioner, and is of a deep color; it id 
made by putting a little water to tlie sugar, 
and Ixiiling it without skimai'm^. or other- 
\\i-e touching the sugar, till of the lii;ht 
color, then lake it off and use immediately. 

If, on preparing the sugar, you happen to 
miss the ri^hl point, add a little cold water, 
and Ixiil once more. 

Observations. The skimmer should 

never be left in the pi i-scn ing-pan after the 

i lai ilied, nor after tlie scum is re-

whole of the sugar ; to avoid this, have by 
the side of you. a pan of cold water, and a 
sponge, with which wipe the sides of the 
pan carefully, the instant after the sugar has 
fallen. 

SUGAR LIKE SNOW. Blanch a 
quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, pound 
them to a yery fine paste in a marble mor- 
tar, with the whites of four egg?; when 
perfectly smooth, add a pound of the best 
lump sugar (in powder), and fiye or six 
more whites of eggs; stir all together well, 
until of such consistence that it may be 
kneaded without adhering to the hands. 
Divide this preparation into two parts, one 
of which, tinge of a red color, either with 
bolus armena, or cochineal, and perfume it 
with essential oil of roses or bergamot ; 
leave the other portion of paste white, but 
flavor it as fullows: grate the rind of two 
fine sound lemons on a small piece of sugar, 
scrape off the surface, and when pounded in 
a small mortar, work it into the uncolored 
portion <it sugar-paste, then roll it out to about 
naif an inch in thickness (having previously 
sprinkled the slab with powder-sugar,) cut 
it with a tin-paste cutter about two inches 
diameter; arrange I hem on white paper, 
which place on a baking tin, and put them 
into a moderate oven for about three-quar- 
ters of an hour; proceed in the same manner 
with the colored paste. When cold, detach 
them from the paper. 

SUGAR PASTE. Take a pound of 
flour, a quarter of a pound of sugar, a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter, a little salt, one 
egg; mix all together with a little water. 
This paste may be used for any second- 
course dish. 



T. 



TABLET OF PATIENCE. Take 
eight eggs, and whip the whites to a firm 
snow ; in the meantime have the yolks 
beaten up with six ounces of powder-sugar; 
(both these operations should be performed 
for at least half an hour) ; then mix the two 
together, add six ounces of sifted flour, and 
when well incorporated, pour in half a pint 
of rose or orange-flower water; stir the 
whole together for some time. Have ready 
some tin plates, well rubbed with butter; 
take a funnel that has three or four tubes, 
fill it with the paste, and push out your 
tablets; when ihe tin plates are full, put 
them into a prctly warm oven. When done, 
take them from the tins whilst hot. 

TRIFLE. (1) Sweeten three pints of 



cream ; add to it half a pint of mountain wine, 
grate in the rind of a lemon, squee/e in the 
juice, and grate in half a nutmeg ; whi.-k this 
up, lay the froth on a large sieve, and the sieve 
over a dish that has ratafia cakes, maca- 
roons, sweet almonds, blanched and pound- 
ed, citron, and can. lied orange-peel, cut into 
small pieces, some currant jelly, and rasp- 
berry jam in it, that the liquor may run 
upon them ; when they are soaked, lay them 
in the dish you intend to serve in, put on the 
froth as high as possible, well drained; 
strew over nonpareils, and stick on little 
slices of citron, orange, or lemon-peel. 

TRIFLE. (2) Lay some macaroons 
and ratafia drops over the bottom of your 
dish, and soak them well with raisin wine, 
when soaked, pour on them a very rich cold 
custard. It must stand two or three inches 
thick ; on that put a layer of raspberry jam, 
and cover the whole with a very high whip 
made the preceding day, of rich cream, the 
whites of two eggs, well lieaten, sugar, lem- 
on-|>eel, and raisin wine, well l>eat with a 
whisk. It is best to make it the day before 
it is wanted, being more solid and better 
tasted. 

TRIFLE. (3) Put half a pound of maca- 
roons into a dish, pour over them some white 
wine, and a pint of custard over that, make 
a whip, and put on it; garnish according to 
your fancy. 



V. 



VANILLA CREAM. Take two 
drachms of vanilla, a quart of milk, the 
yolks of three eggs, five ounces of sugar, and 
a pint of cream; teat up the eggs well with 
the milk, and then add the other ingredients; 
set the whole on a moderate fine, and stir it 
constantly with a wooden spoon, till the 
cream will adhere to it; then strain, and 
serve it cold. 

VANILLA CREAM, BOLTED. 

Take as much cream as will fill the mould 
you intend to use, and boil it up a few 
times, with the proportionate quantities of 
vanilla and sugar; then let it cool, and if 
the mould will contain a quart, mix twelve 
yolks and three whole eggs with the cream, 
and run it five times through a bolting cloth. 
Butter the mould, pour the cream into it, 
and place it in the bain marie, but not too 
hot ; when the cream is set, which you may 
know by touching it gently with your finger, 
turn it on a dish; take the remainder of 
the cream, stir it over the fire like white

sautr, and as soon as it sticks to the spoon 
(which must be of wood), take it off, stir it 
an instant. and then |>our it over the other 
cream, and serve cold. 

VA.MLLA CREAM WHIPPED. Put 
a pinch of gum-dragon into a pint of cream, 
add a BBall qnanttty of orange-flower water, 

powder-sugar to the tate, and a little milk, 
in which sonic vanilla has lcn boiled, and 
the milk strained; whip these in 
with a whisk, until the whole is sufficiently 
frothed ; then lay il carefully on a dish, in a 
pyramidal form, and serve it. 

VANILLA CREAM ICE. Whisk the 
- to a firm froth in a 

preserving pan, pour on tliem the yolks of 
eight, and a |w>nnd of sifted sugar, whip the 
whole well with a whisk, and pour in by de- 
grees two quarts of boiling cream; continue 
to whip it f.r sonic little time, anil then put 
it on die lire, with half an ounce of vanilla 
bruised; still whipping, when it has boiled 
up three or four times, strain it, and freeze 
as usual. (See Ice.) 

VANILLA CREAM LIQUEUR. 

Dissolve over the fire two |>oimds ten ounces 
of broken sugar, in three pints of purified 
river water; when it has l>iled up once, 
pour it into a jar, on three drachms of va- 
nilla, cut in pieces, and half a grain of amber. 
When quite cold, add three pints of good 
brandy, co\er the \esnel, and when it has 
i it with a little pre- 
pared cochineal ; filter, and bottle the li- 
queur. Cork the bottles tight, and seal die 
corks. 

VANILLA STICKS. Take some 

marchpane paste, a quarter of a pound of 
chocolate, and the same of vanilla; mix 
;! into the paste, and then form it 
into sticks, like the vanilla in its original 
form; lay them on a sheet of paper, and 
bake in a slow oven. 

VF.I;|)K. Infuse the rind of three lem- 
ons and four oranges in two quarts of rum 
or braixK , fur fun -anil-twenty hours, close- 
KfftOpped; then s<j'.iee/i: llie juice through 
a strainer; if the fruit is good, there will U- 
half a pint, and if there is not so much, make 
it that; add to il a pound and a quarter of 
sugar, pour to it three quarts of water, and 
keep stirring till all the ^u^ar is dissolved; 
when it is dissolved, stir in the peel and 
spirits, and then one pint of en], I new milk; 
pass it through a bag till clear; bottle it. 
It will keep good for twelve mouths. 

VERJl'ICE. (1) Verjuice is the young, 
unripe, and sour grape; it is frequently 



used in French cookery, but yery rarely put 
into English dishes. 

VERJUICE. (2) Take some crab 
apples when the kernels turn black, lay them 
in a heap to sweat; then pick them from 
the stalks and rottenness, beat them to a 
mash, and press the juice through a bag of 
coarse hair cloth into a clean vessel; it will 
be lit for use in a month's time. If inten- 
ded for white pickles, distil it in a cold still. 
It may be put into sauces when lemon is 
wanting. 

VESPETRO. Take half a [xmnd of 
each of die following seeds: angelica, cori- 
ander, fennel, and caraway, the rinds of 
four lemons, and as many oranges, infuse all 
these in two gallons and a half of the best 
brandy, close the vessel hermetically. In 
five days time, distil it in the bain marie 
alembic, and draw from the alxive ciirautity 
five quarts of liqueur. Dissolve seven 
pounds of sugar in a gallon of pure river 
water ; add this sirup to the liqueur, filter, 
and bottle it. 

VIOLETS CANDIED. Pick off die 

green stalks from some double violets; boil 
.-iime sugar to souffle; put in the violets-, 
and Keep diem in till die sugar again boils 
to souffle; then nib the sugar against the 
sides of the pan until it is white; stir all 
together till the sugar leaves the violets, and 
(hen sift and dry them. 

VIOLETS TO ROCK CANDY. 

Pick the leaves off die violets; then boil 
some of the Itest, and finest sugar to souffle, 
pour it into a candying-pan made of tin, in 
the firm ofadri|>ping-|>an,ahout three inches 
deep; then strew die violet leaves as thick 
as possible on the top, and put it into a hot 
stove, in which let it remain for ten days; 
when it is hard candied, break a hole in one 
corner of it, and drain oil' all die sirup; 
break it out, and place it in heaps upon a 
tin to dry in a stove. 

VIOLETS, CONSERVE OF. Take 

a quarter of a |xuind of early violets, picked; 
bruise them in a mortar; boil two pounds 
of sugar to casse, take it off, put in the pulp, 
and mix them togedier over die fire, and 
when the sugar bubbles up, pour die conserve 
into the moulds. 

VIOLET DROPS. (1) Take a cer- 
tain quantity of sirup of violets, which mix 
with an equal portion of water; use this 
mixture, and make your drops precisely as 
directed. You may, if you please, |>erfume 
it widi oil of violets, but that is not neces- 
sary, as die sirup, imparts sufficient odour

VIOLET DROPS. (2) Take the 
juice of six lemons, mix with it some finely 
sifted powdered sugar, and two spoonfuls 
of essence of violets, and color it of a fine 
blue color; mix the whole well together, 
and dry it over the fire, the same as all oth-

usual si/.e of drops ; let them stand till cold, 
be careful that your mixture is not too thin; 
when (lie drops are cold, put them into pa- 
pered boxes. 

VIOLETS, MARMALADE OF. Take 
three pounds of violets, and four pounds of 
suifar, put the former into a mortar and 
bniisc lliem to a pulp; in the meantime boil 
the sugar to souffle, then add (he flowers; 
stir them together, add two pounds of apple 
marmalade, and when it has boiled up a 
few times, put the marmalade into pots. 

VIOLETS, SIRUP OF. Pound very 
lightly in a marble mortar, and with a 
pestle, one pound of picked violets; 
warm gradually n glass, or earlhenware ves- 
sel with a small opening, into which put the 
pounded flowers, and pour over them two 
pounds of boiling water; dose (he ve^el 
hermetically, and place it on hot ashes, re- 
newing them when necessary, to keep up an 



equal temperature for twelve hours; after 
that time pass the whole through a close 
cloth, squeezing it well; let it stand for half 
an hour; then pour it oflFvery carefully, that 
all the sediment may remain at the bottom; 
weigh it, and the above quantities will have 
yielded seventeen ounces; put into a matrass 
two pounds of cruched sugar with the infu- 
sion, close the matrass tight, and set it in 
the bain marie, over a moderate fire ; .-hake 
it occasionally to accelerate the dissolution 
of the sugar, and when perfectly dissolved, 
let the (ire go out and the matrass cool grad- 
ually. When cold, pour the sirup into 
bottles. 



W. 

WORMWOOD CREME LIQUEUR. 

Oislil in the hain-nttirie the zests of two 
oranges, and half a pound of fresh gathered 
wormwood tops, in a gallon of brandy, 
which will produce nearly half the quantity 
of liqueur. Dissolve four pounds of sugar 
in as many pints of filtered river water; mix 
tliis sirup with the liqueur; run it through 
a jelly -bag, and bottle it.

PREFACE. 



The cook exercises a greater power over the public health and 
welfare than the physician, and if he should be a charlatan in his art^ 
alas ! for his employers. Hitherto, or until of late years, the cook 
has had to educate himself, while the physician appropriates all the 
knowledge of antiquity, and of every succeeding age ; his individual 
cases are all classed according to general principles, while the rules 
that have regulated the preparation of our food, have been discordant 
and unnatural. In the present age, indeed, cookery has been raised 
to the dignity of an art, and sages have given their treatises to the 
world. V^ry has a monument in the cemetery of P^re La Chaise, 
among the tombs of warriors, poets, and philosophers, recording of 
his life that *it was consecrated to the useful arts.' Virgil however, 
writes that the best delights of Elysium were showered upon those 
who received wounds for their country, who lived unspotted priests, 
who uttered verses worthy of Apollo, or who, like V^ry, consecrated 
their lives to the useful arts. On the utilitarian principle the cook 
should be much elevated in public estimation, and were he to form a 
strict alliance with the physician, the patriarchal ages would return, 
and men would die of nothing but sheer old age. 

After insanity, the most grievous affliction of Providence, or rather 
of improvidence and imprudence, is Dyspepsy : a malady that under 
different names has decimated the inhabitants of civilized countries, 
and of almost all countries, in which man is a < cooking animal.' To 
the dyspeptic, the sun has no cheering ray, the air no elasticity or 
balm ; the flowers are without fragrance, music is without melody, 
and beauty without charms. Life is a blank ; afiection has lost its 
power to soothe, and the blessings scattered by Providence, are con- 
verted into ministers of torment. Food becomes a bane ; the very 
staff that supports life, gives the flagellation that renders life a curse. 
All that can delight is lost, — but all that can depress and sting, has a 
tenfold activity and power. 



IT nmrAcm. 

The dyspeptic's <May of life, has fallen into the sear, the yellow- 
Sleep that should 'yisit every pillow but that of guilt, is to hlwn 
no friend ; if he slumbers, it is to dream, like Clarence, of hideous 
forms of suffering, and to wake to their reality. This is but a faint 
picture of Dyspepsy. 

' Her gloomy pretenee aaddeM nD tbe aoem, > 
Shades every flower and darkens every graen. 
Deepens tbe nuirninr -of the feUtng floods. 
And breadieA a brownor horror on the woods.* 

This malady is beyond the science of the physician, but within the 
art of the cook ; in the proverb, Doctor Diet is ranked above Doctor 
Quiet and Doctor Merryman ; though all are good. 

The late Mr. Abemetfay referred almost all maladies to the stom- 
ach, and seldom prescribed any remedy but a proper diet. This it is 
the province ef the cook to provide ; and the design of this book to 
indicate. The work is not designed to spread a taste for pernicious 
luxuries: and every recipe has been sanctioned by custom. The 
responsibility of the cook is lightened, and his duty facilitated. He 
has here a dictionary of reference, an encyclopedia of his art. The 
details are full, and the authority is perfect. There were various 
works of merit that it was useful for the cook to study, but here are 
collected the best parts of all, with the convenience of alphabetical 
arrangement, and in the compass of a moderate volume. If it is a 
sin to waste the best gifls of Providence, it should be little less than 
a felony to spoil them. When we have collected the materials for a 
house, we never trust the building to an unskilful architect: yet we 
are oflen obliged to commit the preparation of our feasts as well as 
of our common food, to agents without knowledge. This knowledge 
is now supplied. 

More than health depends on the proper preparation of food : our 
very virtues are the creatures of circumstances, and many a man has 
hardened his heart, or given up a good resolution, under the operation 
of indigestion. Who that knows the world, ever solicits widi confi- 
dence a friendly or charitable act of another before dinner. 

The natural and moral world are reciprocally dependent ; soul and 
body are so linked, that when one loses its tone the other is deprived 
of its equanimity. The system of morals therefore becomes identi- 
fied with that of cookery, and the great English moralist, who was 
learned in both systems, thus spoke of the connexion ; * Some peo- 
ple * said Doctor Johnson, * have a foolish way of not minding, or of 
pretending not to mind, what they eat. I for my part mind my belly 
very studiously, and very carefully, and I look upon it that he who 
does not mind his belly will hardly mind any thing else.* 



It has tMea the study of the author, to make erery l^ipe pMn, 
and the proportioiie eertain ; Uttle is left to discretion, that coold be 
reduced to measure. The system of confectionery is perfect ; and if 
strictly followed eyery cook may become a first rate confectioner. 
Labor, care, and expense have been bestowed upon the work, and the 
publishers feel so secure of its merit, and of the public want of such a 
book, that they have caused it to be stereotyped. This would have 
been hazardous with a novel or almost any literary work; but the 
number of those who eat is fur greater than of those who read. A 
good book few can estimate ; all can enjoy a good dinner, and the 
publishers anticipate a proportionate encouragement. 

Having devised this work for families, we hope that it may offend 
no one, that we give a word of counsel to domestics : o^r book may 
be every way good, yet will its usefulness be much impaired if do- 
mestics are not docile and faithful. 

We have fortunately, in this country, but one class of people : all nj 
are' free, and all are politically equal. Our domestics are in New 
England designated as Ae(p, to indicate tlmt they are the equals, and 
assistants, rather than the inferiors of their employers. Yet the 
feeling of independence may be carried too far, and it may be ungra- 
ciously expressed. There is no disgrace, and there should be no 
shame in filling well a subordinate station; the hired ploughman, 
maid, or cook are not, in an offensive sense, any more the servants of 
their employers, than the. merchant and the lawyer. All these engage 
to perform certain services for an equivalent, and it is the duty of all 
to do them faithfully. 

The number of domestics is very large — perhaps the average is 
five to four families — and it may be even greater. Yet, unfortunate- '^ 
ly for their welfare, interest, or character, they are almost constantly ^ 
shifting, and in few families do they remain long. In England, a 
good domestic is often provided for during life, and it is a desirable 
situation. It might be so here, if our domestics would strive to ac- 
commodate themselves to their situation. There is hardly a family, 
. in which a kind, respectful, and faithful domestic might not be retained 
for years, and at the best wages. Here then is a home, comfort, and 
friends. Yet the greater number are contented to live a few months 
in a place, till the best years of life have slipped away, without pro- 
vision for age, and without friends, or home. The proverb of the 
rolling stone contains the best lesson for domestics. 

Service in any department is no sacrifice of independence. A 
domestic is in all things as free as any other class, but it is a 
bad khid of independence that would lead one, when desired to do a 



thing in the line of a comnaon employment^ to do it ungraeiottsly, 
and rather as an irksome or unjust task, than as a duty. 

Minor vexations, frequently repeated, are equal to greater individ- 
ual calamities; as many small enjoyments constitute much of the 
pleasures of Jife. Around the social board every member of the fam- 
ily is collected • thrice at least in twenty-four hours. Thither the 
head of the family returns from the labors or cares of his business to 
recruit his strength and to relax his mind. If he return to a table 
constantly and invariably ill spread ; to a dinner to which he could 
invite no friend, and in which he can have no enjoyment; a cloud 
will gather on the calmest brow, and a feeling of dissatisfaction may 
be extended to other things. It is not beneath the solicitude of a 
good wife, who would not suffer any abatement in the affection of 
which she is the object, diligently to study this book, and constantly 
to provide a neat and well dressed repast. -

MANAGEMENT OF FAMILIES. 



In domestic arrangement the table is entitled to no small share 
of attention, as a well conducted system of domestic management 
is the foundation of every comfort; and the respectability and 
welfare of families depend in a great measure on the prudent 
conduct of the female, whose province it is to manage the domes* 
tic concerns. 

However the fortunes of individuals may support a large expen* 
diture, it will be deficient in all that can benefit or grace society, 
and in every thing essential to moral order and rational happiness, 
if not conducted on a regular system, embracing all the objects 
of such a situation. 

In domestic management, as in education, so much must depend 
on the particular circumstances of every case, that it is impossible 
to lay down a system which can be generally applicable. 

The inunediate plan of every family must be adapted to its own 
peculiar situation, and can only result from the good sense and 
early good habits of the parties, acting upon general rational 
principles. 

What one family is to do, must never be measured by what 
another family does. Each one knows its own resources, and 
should consult them alone. What might be meanness in one, 
might be extravagance in another, and therefore there can be no 
standard of re.ference but that of individual prudence. The most 
fatal of all things to private families, is to indulge an ambition to 
make an appearance above their fortunes, professions, or business, 
whatever these may be. ' 

The next point, both for comfort and respectability, is, that all 
the household economy should be uniform, not displaying a parade 
of show in one thing, and a total want of comfort in another. Be- 
sides the contemptible appearance that this must have to every 
person of good sense, it is productive of consequences, not only of 
present, but future injury to a family, that are too oflen irreparable. 

In great cities in particular, how common is it that for the vani- 
ty of having a showy drawing-room to receive company, the family 
are confined to a close back room, where they have scarcely either 
air or light, the want of which must materially prejudice their 
health. 

To keep rooms for show, where the fortune is equal to having 
a house that will accommodate the family properly, and admit of 
this also, belongs to the highest sphere of life; but in private fam- 
ilies, to shut up the only room perhaps in the house which is really 
wholesome for the famOy to live in, is inflicting a kind of lingering 



VIU FAMILY MANAOSMBNT. 

murder upon the inmates; and yet how frequently this considera- 
tion escapes persons who mean well by their family, but who still 
have a grate, a carpet, and chairs, too fine £»r every day's use. 

Another fruit of this evil is, seeing more company, and in s 
more expensive manner than is compatible with the general con- 
venience of the family, introducing with it an expense in dress, 
and a dissipation of time, from which it suffers in various ways. 

Social intercourse is not improved by parade, but quite the 
contrary; real friends, and the pleasantest kind of acquaintance, 
those who like to be sociable, are repulsed by it. It is a failure 
therefore every way — the loss of what is really valuable, and an 
abortive attempt to be fashionable. 

A fundamental error in domestic life of very serious extent, 
involving no less the comfort than the health of the family, arised 
from the ignorance or mistaken notions of the mistress of the house 
upon the subjects of diet and cookery. 

The subject of cookery is thought by too many women to be 
below their attention, or, when practically engaged in, it is with 
no other consideration about it than, in the good housewife's 
phrase, to make the most of every thing, whether good, bad, or 
indifferent; or to contrive a thousand mischievous compositions, 
both savory and sweet, to recommend their own ingenuity. 

If cookery is worth studying, as a sensual gratification, it is 
surely much more so as a means of securing one of the greatest of 
human blessings — good health ; ahd we cannot quit this part of the 
subject of domcistic management without observing, that oiie cause 
of a great deal of injurious cookery originates in the same vanity 
of show that is productive of so many other evils. In order to 
set out a table witli a greater number of dishes than the situation 
of the family requires, more cookery is often undertaken than 
there are servants to do it well, or conveniences in the kitchen for 
^e purpose. Thus some viands are done before they are wanted 
for serving up, and stand by spoiling, to make room for others; 
these are again perhaps to be succeeded by something else ; and 
too often are things served up that had better be thrown away, 
than to be used for food. 

The leading consideration about food ought always to be its 
wholesomeness. Cookery may produce savory and pretty looking 
dishes without their possessing any of the qualities of food. It is 
at the same time both a serious and ludicrous reflection that it 
should be thought to do honor to our friends and ourselves to set 
out a table where indigestion and all its train of evils, such as 
fever, rheumatism, gout, and the whole catalogue of human dis- 
eases lie lurking in almost every dish. Yet this is both done, and 
taken as a compliment. IVe have indeed the ** unbought grace 
of polished society, where gluttony loses half its vice by being 
stripped of its grossness." When a man at a public house dies of 
a surfeit of beef steak and porter, who does not exclaim, what a 
beast!

How tnflniCelj preferable is a dinner of far leM show where 
nobody need be afraid of what they are eating! and such a one 
Ivill be genteel and respectable. If a person can give his friend 
only a leg of mutton, there is nothing to be ashamed of in it, pro- 
vided it is a good one, and well dressed. 

A house fitted up with plain good furniture, the kitchen fur- 
nished with clean wholesome-looking cooking utennls, good fires, 
in grates that give no anxiety lest a good fire should spoil them,> 
clean good table linen, the furniture of the table and sideboard 
good of the kind, without ostentation, and a well-dressed plain 
dinner, bespeak a sound judgment and correct taste in a private 
fiimily, that place it on a footing of respectability with the first 
characters in the country. It is only the conforming to our sphere, 
not the vainly attempting to be above it, that can command true 
respect. 

COOKING UTENSILS. 

• 
The various utensils used for the preparation and keeping of 

food are made either of metal, glass, pottery ware, or wood; each 

of which is better suited to some particular purposes than the 

others. Metallic utensils are quite unfit for many uses, and the 

knowledge of this is necessary to the preservation of health in 

general, and sometimes to the prevention of immediate dangerous 

consequences. ^ 

The metals commonly used in the construction of these vessels 
are silver, copper, brass, tin, iron, and lead. Silver is prefera- 
ble to all the others, because it cannot be dissolved by any of the 
substances used as food. Brimstone unites with silver, and forms 
a thin brittle crust over it, that gives it the appearance of being 
tarnished, which may be accidentally taken with food; but this 
is not particularly unwholesome, nor is it liable to be taken often, 
nor in targe quantities. The discoloring of silver spoons used 
with eggs arises from the brimstone contained in eggs. — Nitre or 
saltpetre has also a slight effect upon silver, but nitre and silver 
seldom remain long enough together in domestic uses to require 
any particular caution. 

Copper and brass are both liable to be dissolved by vinegar, 
acid fruits, and pearl-ash. Such solutions are highly poisonous, 
and great caution should be used to prevent accidents of the kind. 
Vessels made of these metals are generally tinnfed, that is, lined 
with a thin coating of a mixed metal, containing both tin and lead. 
Neither acids, nor any thing containing pearl-ash, should ever be 
suffered to remain above an hour in vessels of this kind, as the 
tinning is dissolvable by acids, and the coating is seldom perfect 
over the surface of the copper or brass. 

The utensils made of what is called block tin are constructed 
of iron plates coated with tin. This is equally to be dissolved as 
the tinning of copper or brass vessels, but iron is not an unwhole- 



some substance, if even a portion of it should be diss<^ved and 
mixed in the food. Iron is therefore one of the safest metals for 
the construction of culinary utensils; and the objection to its nKHr9 
extensive use only rests upon its liability to rust, so that it requires 
more cleaning and soon decays. Some articles of food, such as 
quinces, orange peel, artichokes, kc. are blackened by remaining 
in iron vessels, which therefore must not be used for them. 

Leaden vessels are very unwholesome, and should never be 
.used for milk and cream, if it be ever likely to stand till it become 
sour. They are unsafe also for the purpose of keeping salted 
meats. 

The best kind of pottery ware is oriental china, because the 
glazing is a perfect glass, which cannot be dissolved, and the 
whole substance is so compact that liquid cannot penetrate it. 
Many of the English pottery wares are badly glazed, and as the 
glazing is made principally of lead, it is necessary to avoid put- 
ting vinegar, and other acids into them. Acids and greasy sub* 
stances penetrate into unglazed wares, excepting the strong stone 
ware ; or into those of which the glazing is cracked, and hence 
give a bad flavor to any thing they are used for aflerwards. They 
are quite unfit therefor^ for keeping pickles or salted meats. 
Glass vessels are infinitely preferable to any pottery ware but 
oriental china, and should be used whenever the occasion admits 
of it. 

Wooden vessels are very proper for the keeping many articles 
. of food, and should always be preferred to those lined with lead. 
If any substance has fermented or become putrid in a wooden 
cask or tub, it is sure to taint the vessel so as to make it liable to 
produce a similar effect upon any thing that may be put into it in 
future. It is useful to char the insides of these wooden vessels 
before they are used, by burning wood shavings in them, so as to 
coat the insides with a crust of charcoal. 

As whatever contaminates food in any way must be sure, froin 
the repetition of its baneful effects, to injure the health, a due 
precaution with respect to all culinary vessels is necessary for its 
more certain preservation. There is a kind of hollow iron ware 
lined with enamel, which is superior to every other utensil for 
sauces or preserves: indeed it is preferable for every purpose. 



DIET. 

That we require food, as vegetables require water, to support 
our existence, is the primary consideration upon which we should 
take it. But in our general practice of eating, it cannot be said, 
"we eat to live," but are living passages or channels, througk 
which we are constantly propelling both solids and fluids, for the 
sake of pleasing our palates, at the severe cost often of our whole 
system. 



I>IBT. XI 

A reasMiable indulgence in the abundant supplies of nature, 
eonyerted by art to the purposes of wholesome food, is one of the 
comforts added to the maintenance of life. It is an indiscriminate 
grs^ificatioD of our tastes, regardless of the consequences that 
saay ensue from it, that is alone blamable. But so great is our 
general apathy in these respects, that even on the occurrence of 
diseases, from which we are all more or less sufferers, we scarce- 
ly ever reflect on our diet, as the principal, if not the sole cause 
of tbem. We assign them to weather, to infection, to hereditary 
descent, to spontaneous breeding, as if a disease could originate 
without a cause; or to any frivolous imaginary source, without 
suspecting, or being willing to own, mismanagement of ourselves. 

We derive the renewal of our blood and juices, which are con- 
stantly exhausting, from the substances we take as food. As our 
food, therefore, is proper or improper, too much or too little, so 
will our blood and juices be good or bad, overcharged or deficient, 
and our state of health accordingly good or diseased. 

By aliment, or food, is to be understood whatever we eat or 
drink, including seasonings; such as salt, sugar, spices, vinegar, 
&c. &.C. Every thing, in short, which we receive into our sto- 
machs. Our food, therefore, consists not only of such particles 
as are proper for the nourishment and support of the human body, 
but likewise contains certain active principles, viz. salts, oils, and 
spirits, which have the properties of stimulating the solids, quick- 
ening the circulation, and making the fluids thinner; thus render- 
ing them more suited to undergo the necessary secretions of the 
body. 

The art of preserving health, and obtaining long life, therefore 
consists in the use of a moderate quantity of such diet as shall 
neither increase the salts and oils, so as to produce disease, nor 
diminish them, so as to suffer the solids to become relaxed. 

It is very difficult, almost impossible, to ascertain exactly what 
are the predoniinant qualities either in our bodies or in the food 
we eat. In practice, therefore, we can have no other rule but 
observing by experience what it is that hurts or does us good; 
and what it is our stomach can digest with facility, or the contrary. 
But then we must keep our judgment unbiassed, and not suffer it 
to become a pander to the appetite, and thus betray the stomach 
and health, to indulge our sensuality. 

The eating too little is hurtful, as well as eating too much. 
Neither excess, nor hunger, nor any thing else that passes the 
bounds of nature, can be good to man. 

By loading the stomach, fermentation is checked, and of course 
digestion impeded; for the natural juice of the stomach has not 
room to exert itself, and it therefore nauseates its contents, is 
tifoubled with eructations, the spirits are oppressed, obstructions 
ensue, and fever is the consequence. Besides, that when thus 
overfilled, the stomach presses on the diaphragm, prevents the 
proper play of the lungs, and occasions uneasiness in' our breath- 



log. Hence arise various ill symptoms and depraved, effects 
throughout the body, enervating the strength, decaying the senses, 
hastening old age, and shortening life, ^'hough these effects are 
not immediately perceived, yet they are certain attendants of 
intemperance; for it has been generally observed in great eaters, 
that, though from custom, a state of youth, and a strong constitu- 
tion, they have no present inconvenience, but have digested their 
food, suffered surfeit, and borne their immoderate diet well ; if the^ 
have not been unexpectedly cut off, they have found the symptoms 
of old age come on early in life, attended with pains and innume- 
rable disorders. 

If we value our health, we must ever make it a rule not to eat 
to satiety or fulness, but desist while the stomach feels quite easy. 
Thus we shall be refreshed, light, and cheerful; not dull, heavy, 
or indisposed. Should we ever be tempted to eat too much at one 
time, we should eat the less at another. Thus, if our dinner has 
been larger than usual, let our supper be less, or rather quite 
omitted; for there is ^lo man, however careful of his health, who 
does not occasionally transgress in this way. 

With regard to the times of eating, they must to a certain degree 
be conformed to family convenience, but ought to be quite inde-> 
pendent of the caprices of fashion. The great things to be guard- 
ed against are, either eating too soon after a former meal, or 
fasting too long. — The stomach should always have time to empty 
itself before it is filled again. 

Some stomachs digest their contents sooner than others, and if 
long empty it may destroy the appetite, and greatly disturb both 
the head and animal spirits ; for, from the great profusion of nerves 
spread upon the stomach, there is an immediate sympathy between 
that and the head. Hence the head is sure to be affected by 
whatever disorders the stomach, whether from any particular ali- 
ment that disagrees with it, or being overfilled, or too long empty. 
Such as feel a gnawing in the stomach, as it is called, should not 
wait till the stated time of the next meal, but take a small quanti- 
ty of light, easily digested food, that the stomach may have some- 
thing to work on. 

Young persons in health, who use much exercise, may eat three 
times a- day. But such as are in years, such as are weak, as do 
no work, use no exercise, or lead a sedentary life, eating twice in 
the day is suf&cient ; or, as in the present habits of society, it might 
be difficult to arrange the taking only two meals, let them take 
three very moderate ones. Old and weak persons may eat often, 
but then it should be very little at a time. 

The quality of our food is a subject of greater difficulty than 
the quantity ; moderation is an invariably safe guide in the latter 
instance; but though always favorable to prevent ill effects from 
any error in quality, it will not always1)e effectual. 

To a person in good health, with a strong stomach, and whose 
constant beverage is water, cold or tepid, according to the sea- 



WHiy or some aqueoiis li^vor, Ike nieeties of choice in food of 
cookery are leM material than to persons with naturally weak st^y- 
maehs^ or to those in sickness, or for children. Bat all persons 
who would to a certainty preserve their health and faculties, and 
Uye out the natural term of life, should use plain food, as mil high 
seasonings and compound mixtures have an injurious efiect, soon- 
er or later, on the strongest constitutions. If a few instances can 
be quoted to the contrary, these, like other anomalies in nature, 
cannot constitute an exception to a well established fact. 

No part of our aliment is more important than our beverage. 
It is essential to moisten and convey our more solid food into the 
rtomach, and from thence to the respective parts of the body. To 
allay thirst, to dilute the blood, that it may circulate through the 
nnnutest vessels, to dissolve and carry off by the watery secre* 
tions the superfluous salts we take in- our food ; to answer these 
purposes no liquid is so eflectual as pure water, with the exception 
of some few eases. No other liquid circulates so well, or mixes so 
immediately with our fluids. All other liquors are impregnated 
with particles which act strongly upon the solids or fluids, or both; 
but water being simple, operates only by diluting, moistening, and 
cooling, which are the great uses of drink pointed out to us by 
nature. Hence it is evident that water is in general the best and 
most ivholesome drink; but some constitutions require something 
to warm and stimulate the stomach, and then fermented liquors 
taken in moderation are proper; such as beer, ale, cider, wine, 
&c. the choice and quantity of which depend on the age, consti- 
tution, and manner of living of the drinker; and to have them 
pure is above all things essential; as otherwise, instead of being 
of any benefit, they will be highly detrimental. 

Drams, or distilled spirituous liquors, the use of which is unhap-* 
pily very prevalent, are of the most poisonous qualities; and from 
their direful effects are the destruction of thousands. From the 
degree of heat they have undergone in distillation they acquire a 
corrosive and burning quality, which makes them as certain to 
kill as laudanum or arsenic, though not so soon. They contract 
the fibres and vessels of the body, especially where tbey are 
ike tenderest, as in the brain, and thus destroy the intellectual 
faculties. They injure the coat of the stomach, and thus expose 
the nerves and weaken the fibres till the whole stomach becomes 
at last soft, flabby, and relaxed. From whence ensues loss of 
Bppetiie, indigestion, and diseases that generally terminate in 
premature death. Spirituous liquors in any way, whether alone, 
mixed with water, in punch, shrub, noyau, or other liqueurs, are 
all slow poisons. 

It would be endless to enter on an account of the different quali- 
ties of all sorts of wines, but it may be said in general, that all 
the light wines of a moderate strength, due age and maturity, are 
more wholesome for the constitution than the rich, hot, strong,

The \mi tkiiig to be said concerning liquors is, that wine aod 
sU other stsong liquors, are as hard to digest aa solid etrong foodv 
This is not oaHy evident with respect to perseos of weak stomaeha 
and digestion, but also from strong healthy people, who on^ 
drink either water or small beer at their meals, and are able to 
eat and digest almost double the quantity of what they could if 
they drank strong liquors. It appears very plain, thereibre, that 
we should not drink strong liquors at ^our meals, as by their heat 
and activity they hurry the food undigested into the habit of tho 
body, and by that means lay a foundation lor various distempers. 
An abstinence, in short, from fermented liquors would preserve 
our saental faci^ies in vigor, and our bodies from many pain&l 
disorders that afflict mankind, as there is no doubt that we may* 
principally ascribe to them the gout, rheumatism, stone, cancer^ 
fevers, hysterics, lunacy, apoplexy, and palsy. 



BOILING. 

This most simple of culinary processes is not oflen performed i» 
perfection. It does not require quite so much nicety and atten* 
daace as roasting ; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiHnff 
(the slower the better) all the while, to know how long is required 
for doing the joint, &c., and to take it up at the critical moment 
when it is done enough, comprehends almost the whole art and 
niystery. This, however, demands a patient and perpetual vigi- 
lance, of which few persons are capable. 

The cook must take especial care that the water reafiy boils all 
the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time ; and 
make up a sufficient fire at first, to last all the time, without much 
mending or stirring. A frugal cook will manage with much less 
five for boiling than she uses for roasting. 

When the pot is coming to a boil there will always, from ike 
cleanest meat and clearest water, rise a scum to the top of it, pro* 
ceeding partly from the water ; this must be carefully taken off «s 
soon as it rises. 

On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When 
you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw 
up the rest of the scum. 

The oftener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water* 
is kept, the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat. 
, If let « alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat, whiclb, 
instead of k>oking delicately white and nice, will have th-at ooarae 
and ihhy appearance we have too oflen to complain of, and the- 
botoher and poulterer be blamed for the carelessness g£ the eo^ 
lA 90t skimnung her pot.

those who wish to excel in their art must oplv consider liow Iha 
lirocesses of it can he most perfectly performed : a cook, who iiaa 
a proper pride and pleasure in her business^ will make this kar 
maxim on all occasions. 

It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickaesa^ or^ 
before thicker parts are done enough, the thimier wiU be done 4oa 
much. 

Put your meat into cold water, in the proportion of about a quait 
of water to a pound of meat : it should be covered with water during 
the whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it ; the less 
water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savory will 
he the meat, and the better will be the broth. 

The water should be heated gradually, according to the thick- 
aess, &c. of the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of 
ten pounds weight should be placed over a moderate fire, which 
will gradually make the water hot, without causing it to boil for 
about forty minutes ; if the water boils much sooner, the meat will 
be hardened, and shrink up as if it was scorched : by keeping the 
water a certain time heating without boiling, the fibres of the meat 
mre dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken 
.<^as soon as it rises. 

The editor placed a thermometer in water in that state which 
cooks call gentle simmering ; the heat was 212^, i. e. the same 
degree as the strongest boiling. ^ 

Two mutton chops were covered with cold water ; one boiled a 
gallop, while the other simmered very gentl;^ for three^uarters of 
sn hour : the chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly su- 
perior to that which was boiled ; it was much tenderer, more juicy^ 
and much higher flavored. The liquor which boiled fast was in 
like proportion more savory, and when cold had much more fat 
on its surface. This explains why quick boiling renders meat 
hard, Slc, because its juices are e^^tracted in a greater degree. 

Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil. 

The old rule of Id minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather 
too little : the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter 
it will be. 

For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all 
will who have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a 
pound for fresh, and rather more for salted. meat, will not be found 
too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing 
more or less time, according to the thickness of the joint, and the 
coldness of the weather : to know the state of which, let a ther- 
mometer be placed in the pantry ; and when it falls below 40 ^, tell 



xn BAKiire. 

your cods to give rather more time in both roasting* snd boifing, 
always remembering, the slower it boils the better. 

Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art ; and cooka' 
seem to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, 
and set it over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance 
whether it simmers without a bubble or boils a gallop. . 

Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that 
which has been kept till it is what the butchers call ripe ; and long- 
er in cold than in warm weather : if it be frozen, it must be thawed 
before boiling as before roasting ; if it be fresh-killed, it will be 
tough and hard, if you stew it ever so long, and ever so gent}f. 
In cold weather, the night before the day you dress it, bring it inlo 
a place of which the temperature is not less than 45 degrees of 
Fahrenheit's thermometer. 

The size of the boiling-pots should be adapted to what they are 
to contain : the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon 
the (ire, and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate 
increase of fire to boil it. 

In small famihes we recommend block-tin saucepans, &c. as 
lightest and safest. If proper care is taken of them, and they are 
well dried after they are cleaned, they are by far the cheapest ; 
the purchase of a new tin saucepan being little more than the ex- 
pense of tinning a copper one. 

Let the covers of your boiling-pots fit close, not only to prevent 
unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape 
of the nutritive matter, which must then remain either in tlie meat 
or in the broth ; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself 
under the edge of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste. 

If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done 
enough, it will become sodden, and lose its flavor. 

Beef and mutton a little under-done (especially very large joints, 
which will make the better hash or broil,) is not a great fault ; by 
some people it is preferred : but Iamb, pork, and veal are uneata- 
ble if not thoroughly boiled ; but do not over-do them. 

A trivet or fish-drainer put on the bottom of the boiling-pot, rais- 
ing the contents about an inch and a half from the bottom, wiN 
prevent that side of the meat which comes next the bottom from 
being done too much, and the lower part of the meat will he as 
delicately done as the other part ; and this will enable you to take 
out the contents of the pot, without sticking a fork, &c. into it. 
If you have not a trivet, use four skewers, or a soup-plate laid the 
wrong side upwards. 

BAKING. 

Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of 
dressing a dinner in small families; and, I may say, that the oven 
is often the only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a 
joint of meat. 



lAttllG. 

I do not wmn to denj the superior excellence of romstlng to 
baking; but some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the 
same when roasted, that I have known them to be carried to the 
table, and eaten as such with great satisfactioil. 

Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and manj 
other joints, will bake to great advantAge, if the meat be good; 
I mean well-fed, rather inclined to be fat: if the meat be poor, no 
baker can give satisfaction. 

When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been half 
baked I have seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarcely 
to be believed. 

Besides those joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate a few 
baked dishes which I can particularly recommend. 

A pig, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have 
its ears and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, 
and a bit of butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back 
with, otherwise it will be apt to blister: with 'a proper share of 
attention from the baker, I consider this way equal to a roasted 
one. 

A goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care to have 
it on a stand, and when half done to turn the other side upwards. 
A duck the same. 

A buttock of beef the following way is particularly fine. After 
it has been in salt about a week, to be well washed, and put into 
a brown earthen pan with a pint of water ; cover the pan tight 
with two or three thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper: never 
cover anything that is to be baked with brown paper, the pitch 
and tar that is in brown paper will give the meat a smoky, bad 
taste: give it four or five hours in a moderately heated oven. 

A ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out and 
wiped, a crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and baked in 
a moderately heated oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer 
flavor, than a boiled one. I have been in the habit of bakinff 
small cod-fish, haddock, and mackerel, with a dust of flour, and 
some bits of butter put on them; eels, when large and stufied; 
herrings and sprats, in a brown pan, with vinegar and a little 
spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared the same as 
for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, and a little drop of milk 
put into the dish, and basted several times, will be found nearly 
equal to roasting; or cut it up, season it properly, put it into a 
jar or pan, and cover it over and bake it in a moderate oven for 
about three hours. In the same manner, I have been in the hab- 
it of baking legs and shins of beef, ox cheeks, &c. prepared with 
a seasoning of onions, turnips, &c.: they will take about four 
hours: let them stand till cold, to skim oflT the fat; then warm it 
up all together, or part, as you may want it. 

All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first families. 

The time each of the above articles should take depends much 
upon the state of the oven, and I do consider the baker a suf- 

B* 



ficient judge; if ihej are sent to hun ia time, he most be Terjr 
neglectful if they, are not ready at the time they are ordered. 



ROASTING. 

Let the young cook never forget that cleanlinese is the chief 
cardinal virtue of the kitchen; the first preparation for roasting 
is to take care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand and 
water; nothing else. When it has been well scoured with this, 
dry it with a clean cloth. If spits are wiped clean a» soon as the 
meat is drawn from them, and while they are hot, a very little 
cleaning will be required. The less the spit is passed through 
the meat the better; and, before you spit it, joint it properly, es- 
pecially necks and loins, that the carver may separate them easi- 
ly and neatly, and take especial care it be evenly balanced on 
the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the Hre operate 
equally on each part of it; therefore, be provided with balancingf 
skewers and cook holds, and see it is properly jointed. 

Make up the fire in time ; let it be proportioned to the dinner 
to be dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end 
than the thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be 
dqne nice and brown. 

A cook must be as particular to propovtion her fire lo the busi- 
ness she has to do, as a chemist: the degree of heat most desira- 
ble for dressing the different sorts of food ought to be attended 
to with the utmost precision. 

The fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble sirloin 
will parch up a lighter joint. 

Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly 
avoid it; but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a 
considerable distance, and allow a little more time. 

Preserve the fat, by covering it with paper, for this purpose 
called ^^ kitchen-paper,'* and tie it on with fine twine; pins and 
skewers can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to 
let out the gravy: besides, the paper oAen starts from them and 
catches fire, to the great injury of the meet. 

If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should 
be little and brisk: when you have a large joint to roast, make up 
a sound, strong fire, equally good in every part, or your meat 
cannot be equally ^roasted, nor have that uniform color which 
constitutes the beauty of good roasting. 

Give the fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down; 
examine it from time to time while the spit is going round; keep 
it clear at the bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in 
the front, which will spoil the look and taste of the meat, and 
hinder it from roasting evenly. 

When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end than the 
other, place the spit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the fire. 



BOASTfHO. SIX 

•'Do not put meat too near the fire at first; the larger the joint, 
the farther it must be kept from the fire: if once it gets scorched, 
the outside will become hard, and acquire a disagreeable, empjrr- 
eumatic taste ; and the fire being prevented from penetrating into 
it, the meat will appear done before it. is little more than half 
done, besides losing the pale brown color, which it is the beautj 
of roasted meat to have. 

Be very careful to place the dripping-pan at such a distance 
firom the fire as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near, the 
ariies will fall into it, and spoil the drippings. 

If it is too far fi'om the fire to catch them, you will not only lose 
your drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by 
the fcetid smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live 
cinders. 

A large dripping-pan is convenient for several purposes. It 
should not be less than twenty-eight inches long and twenty inch- 
es wide, and have a covered well on the side from the fire, to 
collect the drippings; this will preserve them in the most delicate 
state: in a pan of the above size you may set fried fish, and vari- 
OiQs dishes, to keep hot. 

The time meat will take roasting will vary according to the 
time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather; the 
same weight will be twenty minutes or half an hour longer in 
cold weather, than it Mrill be in warm; and if fresh killed, than if 
it has been kept till it is tender. 

Everybody knows the advantage of slow hoUing. Shw roasting 
is equally important. 

It is difiicult to give any specific rule for time; but if your fire 
is made as before directed, your meat-screen sufficiently large to 
ffuard what you are dressing from currents of air, and the meat 
IS not frosted, you cannot do better than follow the old general 
rule of allowing rather more than a quarter of an hour to the 
pound ; a little more or less, according to the temperature of the 
weather, in proportion as the piece is thick or thin, the strength 
of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and the frequency with 
which you baste it; the more it is basted the less time it will take, 
as it keeps the meat sofl and mellow on the outside, and the fire 
acts with more force upon it. 

Reckon the time, not to the hour when dinner is ordered, but 
to the moment the roasts will be wanted. Supposing there are a 
dozen people to sip soup and eat fish first, you may allow them 
ten or fifteen minutes for the former, and about as long for the 
latter, more or less, according to the temptations the ** bon gout" 
of these preceding courses has to attract their attention. 

When the joint is half done, remove the spit and dripping-pan 
back, and stir up your fire thoroughly, that it may burn clear and 
bright for the browning; when the steam from the meat draws to- 
wards the fire, it is a sign of its being done enough; but you will 
be the best judge of that, from the time it has been down, the 



strength of th# fire you Jiave uaed, and the distance jour spil has 
been from it. 

Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy, and 
Just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire to brown it. If 
you wish to froth it, baste it, and dredge it with flour carefully: 
you cannot do this delicately u^ce without a very good light. 
The common fault seems to be using too much flour. The meat 
ahould have a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of 
being covered with a paste. Those who are particular about the 
froth use butter instead of drippings. 

A gopd cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance and 
color of her roasts, as a young beauty is to her complexion at a 
birthday ball. If your meat does not brown so much, or so even* 
ly as you wish, take two ounces of glaze, i. e. portable soup, put 
four table-spoonfuls of water, and let it warm and dissolve gradu- 
ally by the side of the fire. This will be done in about a quarter 
of an hour; put it on the meat equally all over with a paste-brush 
the last thing before it goes to table. 

Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally 
considered one of the most easy and simple processes of cook- 
ery, it requires more unremitting attention to perform it perfect- 
ly we]l than it does to make most made dishes. 

That made dishes are the most difficult preparations, deserves 
to be reckoned among the culinary vulgar errors; in plain roast- 
ing and boiling it is not easy to repair a mistake once made; and 
all the discretion and attention of a steady, careful cook, must 
be unremittingly upon the alert. 



FRYING. 

Frying is often a convenient mode of cookery; it may be per- 
formed by a fire which will not do for roasting or boiling ; and by 
the introduction of the pan between the meat and the fire, things 
get more equally dressed. 

The Dutch oven or bonnet is a very convenient utensil for small 
things, and a very useful substitute for the jack, the gridiron, ^or 
frying-pan. 

A frying-pan should be about four inches deep, with a perfectly 
flat and thick bottom, twelve inches long .and nine broad, with 
perpendicular sides, and nrast be half filled with fat: good frying 
is, in fact, boiling in fat. To make sure that the pan is quite 
clean, rub a little fat over it, and then make it warm, and wipe it 
out with a clean cloth. 

Be very particular in frying, never to use any oil, butter, lard, 
or drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free from salt 
Any thing dirty spoils the look; any thing bad-tasted or ^ale, 
spoils the flavor; and salt prevents its browning. 

Fine olive oil is the most delicate for frying; but the best oil is 
expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it. 



For general purposes, and especially for fish, clean fresh lard 
is not near so expensive as oil or clarified butter, and does almost 
as well. Butter often burns before you are aware of it ; and what 
jou fry will get a dark and dirty appearance. 

Dripping, if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as any 
thing; if not clean, it may be easily clarified. Whatever fat yon 
use, after you have done frying, let it remain in the pan for a few 
minutes, and then pour it through a sieve into a clean basin; it 
will do three or four times as well as it did at first, t. e, if it has not 
burned: but, the fat you have fried fish in nrast not be used for 
any other purpose. 

To know when the fat is of a proper heat, according to what 
you^are to fry, is the great secret in frying. 

To iry fish, parsley, potatoes, or any thing that is watery, your 
6re must be very clear, and the fat quite hot; which you may bo 
pretty sure of, when it has done hissing, and is still. We cannot 
msiet too strongly on this point: if the fat is not very hot, you 
cannot fry fish either to a good color, or firm and crisp. 

To be quite certain, throw a little bit of bread into the pan ; if it 
fries crisp, the fat is ready; if it burns the bread, it is too hot. 

The fire under the pan must be clear and sharp, otherwise the 
fat is so long before it becomes ready, and demands such attend- 
ance to prevent the accident of its catching fire, that the patience 
of cooks is exhausted, and they frequently, from ignorance or im- 
patience, throw in what they are going to fry before the fat is half 
hot enough. Whatever is so fried will be pale and sodden, and 
offend the palate and stomach not less than the eye. 

Have a good light to fry by, that you may see when you have 
got the right color: a lamp fixed on a stem, with a loaded foot, 
which has an arm that lengthens out, and slides up and down like 
a reading candlestick, is a most usefiil appendage to kitchen fire- 
places, which are very seldom light enough for the nicer opera- 
tions of cookery. 

After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the fat from what you 
have fried, especially from those things that are full dressed in 
bread crumbs, or biscuit powder, &.C., your cooking will^ do you 
no credit. 

The dryness of fish depends much upon its having been fried in 
fat of a due degree of heat ; it is then crisp and dry in a few min- 
utes after it is taken out of the pan: when it is not, lay it on a sofi 
cloth before the fire, turning it occasionally, till it is. This will 
aometimes take fifteen minutes: therefore, always fry fish as long 
as this before you want them, for fear you may find this necessary. 

To fry fish, see receipt to fry soles, which is the only circum- 
stantial account of the process that has yet been printed. If the 
cook will study it with a little attention, she must soon become an 
accomplished frier. 

Frying, though one of the most common of culhiary operations, 
is one that is least commonly performed perfectly well. 



BROILING. 

Cleanliness is extreiaelj emential in this mode of cookery. 

Keep your gridiron quite clean between the bars, and bright on 
the top: when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen cloth: just before 
you use it, rub the bars with clean mutton-suet, to prevent the 
meat from being marked by the gridiron. 

Take care to prepare your fire in time, so that it may bum 
quite clear: a brisk and clear fire is indispensable, or you cannot 
give your meat that browning which constitutes the perfection of 
this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to food it cannot receive 
any other way. 

The chops or slices should be from half to three-quarters of an 
inch in thickness; if thicker, they will be done too much on the 
outside before the inside is done enough. 

Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing is 
done: never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you make 
smoke and spoil it. 

Let the bars of the gridiron be all hot through, but yet not 
burning. hot upon the surface: this is the perfect and fine condition 
<^the gridiron. 

As the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers, it 
is absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly hot before the 
tiling to be cooked be laid on them. 

The bars of gridirons should be made concave, and terminate in 
a trough to catch the gravy and keep the fat from dropping into 
the fire and making a smoke, which will spoil the broil. 

Upright gridirons are the best, as they can be used at any fire 
without fear of smoke ; and the gravy is preserved in the trough 
under them. 

N. B. Broils must be brought to table as hot as possible; set a 
dish to heat when you put your chops on the gridiron, from whence 
to the mouth their progress must be as quick as possible. 

When the fire is not clear, the business of the gridiron may be 
•done by the Dutch oven or bonnet. 

Take care to have a very clear, brisk fire; throw a little salt on 
it; make the gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to prevent the fat 
from dropping into the fire, and making a smoke. It requires 
more practice and care than is generally supposed to do steaks to 
a nicety; and for want of these little attentions, this very common 
dish, which every body is supposed capable of dressing, seldom 
4^ome8 to table in perfection. 

Ask those you cook for, if they like it under, or thoroughly 
done; and what accompaniments they like best; it is usual to put 
a table-'spoonful of ketchup, or a little minced eschalot, into a dish 
before the fire; while you are broiling, turn the steak, &c. with ft 
pair of steak-tongs, it will be done in about tenor fifteen minutes; 
rub a bit of butter ovier it, and umi it up garnished with piekles 
and finely-scraped horse-radish.

BROTHS ANP SOUPS. 



The cook must pay continual attention to the condition of her 
stew-pans, sonp^ketties, &c. which should be examined every time 
they are used. .The prudent houaewife will carefully examine the 
condition of them herself at least once a month. Their covers 
also must be kept perfectly clean and well tinned, and the stew- 
pans not only on the inside, but about a couple of inches on the 
outside: many mischiefs arise from their getting out of repair; 
and if not kept nicely tinned, all your good work will be in vain; 
the broths and soups will look green and dirty, taste bitter and 
poisonous, and will be spoiled both for the eye and palate, and 
your credit will be lost. 

The hesdth, and even life of the family, depends upon this, and 
the cook may be sure her employers had rather pay the tinman's 
hiiJ than the doctor's; therefore, attention to this cannot fail to 
engage the regard of the mistress, between whom and the cook it 
will be my utmost endeavor to promote perfect harmony. 

If she has the misfortune to scorch or blister the tinning of her 
pan, which will happen sometimes to the most careful cook, I ad- 
vise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint her employers, 
who will thank her for candidly mentioning an accident ; and cen- 
sure her deservedly if she conceal it. 

Take care to be properly provided with sieves and tammy cloths, 
spoons and ladles. Make it a rule without an exception, never to 
use them till they are well cleaned and thoroughly dried, nor any 
stew-pans, &c. without first washing them out with boiling water, 
and rubbing them well with a dry cloth and a little bran, to clean 
them from grease, sand, &c., or any bad smell they may have got 
since they were last used : never neglect this. 

Though we do not suppose our cook to be such a naughty slut 
aato wilfully, neglect her broth-pots, &c., yet we may recommend 
her to wafih them immediately, and take care they are thoroughly 
dried at the fire, before they are put by, and to keep them in a dry 
piece, for damp will rust and destroy them very soon: attend to 
this the first moment you can spare after the dinner is sent up. 

Never put by any soup, gravy, &c. in metal utensils; in which 
never keep any thing longer than is absolutely necessary for the 
purposes of cookery; the acid, vegetables, fat, &c. employed in 
making soups, &c. are capable of dissolving such utensils: there- 
fore stone or earth em vessels should be used for this purpose. 

Stew-pans, soup-pots, and preserving pans, with thick and round 
bottems (such as saucepans are made with), will wear twice as 
losg, and are cleaned with half the trotd)le, as those whose sides 
aie soldered to the bottom, for sand and grease get into the 
joined part, and cookeys say that it is next to an impossibility to 
dislodge it, even if their nails are as long as Nebnchadnezzar's. 

XrIka ease that the lids fit as elose as possible, that the broth, 



I 

Boup, and sauces, &c. may not waste by evaporation. They are 
good for nothing,^ unless they fit tight enough to keep the steanoi is 

and the smoke out. 

Stew-pans and saucepans should be always bright on the upper 
rim, where the fire does not burn them; but to scour them all over, 
is not only giving the cook needless trouble, but wearing out the 
vessels. 

Lean, juicy beef, mutton, or veal, form the basis of broth; pro- 
cure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and as fresh 
killed as possible. 

Stale meat will make broth grouty and bad tasted, and fat meat 
is wasted. This only applies to those broths which are required 
to be perfectly clear: fat and clarified drippings may be so com- 
bined with vegetable mucilage, ad to afford, at the small cost of 
one penny per .quart, a nourishing and palatable soup, fully ade*' 
quate to satisfy appetite and support strength: this will open a 
new source to those benevolent housekeepers, who are disposed 
to relieve the poor, will show the industrious classes how much 
they have it in their power to assist themselves, and rescue them 
from being objects of charity d« pendent on the precarious bounty 
of others, by teaching them how they may obtain a cheap, abun- 
dant, salubrious, and agreeable aliment for themselves and fam- 
ilies. 

This soup has tl^e advantage of being very easily and very soon 
made, with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room. Those 
who have not tasted it, cannot imagine what a salubrious, savoiy, 
and satisfying meal is produced by the judicious combination of 
cheap homely ingredients. v 

The general fault of our soups seems to be the employment of 
an excess of spice, and too small a portion of roots and herbs. 

Th^re is no Fjrench dinner without soup, which is regarded as 
an indispensable overture ; and believe it an excellent plan to begin 
the banquet with a basin of good soup, which, by moderating the 
appetite for solid animal food, is certainly a salutiferous custom. 

We again caution the cook to avoid over-seasoning, especially 
with predominant flavors, which, however agreeable they may be 
to some, are extremely disagreeable to others. 

Zest, soy, cavice, coratch, anchovy, curry powder, savory ra- 
gout powder, soup herb powder, browning, ketchups, pickle li- 
quor, beer, wine, and sweet herbs, and savory spice*, are very 
convenient auxiliaries to finish soups, &c. 

The proportion of wine should not exceed a large wine-glass- 
ful to a quart of soup. This is as much as can be admitted, ' 
without the vinous flavor becoming remarkably predominant; 
though not only much larger quantities of wine (of which claret is 
incomparably the best, because it contains less spirit and more 
flavor, and English palates are less acquainted with it), but even 
veritahle eau de tne is ordered in many books, and used by many 
(especially tavern cooks). So much are their soups overloaded 



relish, that if jou will eat enough of them they will certainly 
Bwke JOU drunk, if they don't make you sick: all this frequently 
arises from an old cook measuring the excitability of the eaters* 
pcLlates by his own, which may be so blunted by incessant tasting, 
that to awaken it, requires wine instead of water, and cayenne 
and garlic for black pepper and onion. 

The art of composing a rich soup is so to proportion the seve- 
ral ingredients one to another, that no particular taste be strong- 
er than the rest, but to produce such a fine harmonious relish that 
the whole is delightful. This requifes that judicious combination 
of the materials which constitutes the "chef d*muvre'* of culinary 
science. 

In the first place, take care that the roots and herbs be per- 
fectly well cleaned ; proportion the water to the quantity of meat 
and other ingredients, generally a pound of meat to a quart of 
water for soups, and double that quantity for gravies. If they 
atew gently, little more water need be put in at first than is ex- 
pected at the end ; for when the pot is covered quite close, and 
the fire gentle, very little is wasted. 

Gientle stewing is incomparably the best; the meat is more ten- 
der, and the soup better flavored. 

It is of the first importance that the cover of a soup-kettle 
should fit very close, or the broth will evaporate before you are 
aware of it. 

Place your soup-pot over a moderate fire, which will make the 
water hot without causing it to boil for at least half an hour; if 
the water boils immediately, it will not penetrate the meat, and 
cleanse it from the clotted blood, and other matters which ought to 
go ofi* in scum; the meat will be hardened all over by violent heat; 
wiJi shrink up as if it was scorched, and give hardly any g^avy:. 
on the contrary, by keeping the water a certain time heating with- 
out boiling, the meat swells, becomes tender, its fibres are dilated, 
and it yields a quantity of acum, which must be taken off as soon 
as it appears. 

It is not tiU afler a good half hour's hot infusion that we may 
mend the fire, and make the pot boil : still continue to remove the 
scum; and when no more appears, put in the vegetables, Slc. and 
a little salt. These will cause more 9cum to rise, which must be 
taken ofiT immediately; then cover the pot very closely, and place 
it at a proper distance firom the fire, where it wtfl boil very gently, 
and equally, and by no means fast. 

By quick and strong boiling the volatile and finest parts of the 
ingredients are evaporated, and fiy off with the steam, and the 
coarser parts are rendered soluble ; so you lose the good, and get 
the bad. 

Soups will generally take from three to sist hours. 

Prepare your broths and soups the evening before yon want 
them« This will give you more time to attend to the rest of your 
diaaer the next day; and when the soup is cold, the fai may be 

C 



SXVl BROTHS AHD 0OUP8. 

much more easily and completely removed from the surfoce of it. 
When you decant it» take care not to disturb the settlings at the 
bottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through 
a sieve, or even through a tamis, which is the best strainer, the 
soups appear smoother and finer, and it is much easier cleaned 
than any sieve. If you strain it while it is hot, pass it through a 
clean tamis or napkin, previously soaked in cold water ; the cold- 
ness of this will coagulate the fat, and only suffer the pure broth 
to pass through. 

The full Havor of the ingredients can only be extracted by very 
long and slow simmering ; during which take care to prevent 
evaporation, by covering the pot as close as possible: the best 
stew-pot is a digester. 

Clear soups must be perfectly transparent; thickened soups, 
about the consistence of rich cream; and remember that thickened 
soups require nearly double the quantity of seasoning. 

To thicken and give body to soups and sauces, the following 
materials are used: they must be gradually mixed with the soup 
till thoroughly incorporated with it ; and it should have at least 
half an hour's gentle simmering afler: if it is at ail lumpy, pass it 
through a tamis or a fine sieve. Bread raspings, bread, isinglass, 
potato mucilage, flour, or fat skimmings and flour, or flour and 
butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal and water rubbed well together. 

To their very rich gravies, &c. the French add the white meat 
of partridges, pigeons, or fowls, pounded to a pulp, and rubbed 
through a sieve. A piece of beef, which has been boiled to make 
broth, pounded in the like manner with a bit of butter and flour, 
and gradually incorporated with the gravy or soup, will be found 
a satisfactory substitute for these more expensive articles. 

Meat from which broth has been made and all its juice has been 
extracted, is then excellently well prepared for potting, and is 
quite as good, or better, than that which has been baked till it is 
dry; indeed, if it be pounded, and seasoned in the usual manner, 
it will be an elegant and savory luncheon, or supper, and costs 
nothing but the trouble of preparing it, which is very little, and a 
relish is procured for sandwiches, &c. of what heretofore has been 
by the poorest housekeeper considered the perquisite of the cat. 

JLeep some spare broth lest your soup-liquor waste in boiling, 
and get too thick, and for gravy for your made dishes, various 
sauces, &c. ; for many of which it is a much better basis than 
melted butter. 

The soup of mock turtle, and the other thickened soups, will 
supply you with a thick gravy sauce for poultry yfah, ragouts, &.c.; 
and by a little management of this sort, you may generally con- 
trive to have plenty of good gravies and good sauces with very 
little trouble or expense. 

If soup is too thin or too weak, take ofl*the cover of your soup- 
pot, and let it boil till some of the watery part of it has evaporated, 
or else add some of the thickening materials we have before men- 



OBtBBVATiant. xxfii 

tioned ; and have at hand some {dain browning. This simple pre- 
paration is much better than anj of the compounds bearing that 
name; as it colors sauce or soup without much interfering with its 
flaTOT, and is a much better way of coloring them than burning 
the sar&ce of thp meat. 

When soups and gravies are kept from daj to day, in hoi weather ^ 
they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded 
tureens or pans, and placed in a cool cellar; in temperate weather 
every other day may be enough. 

We hope we have now put the common cook into possession of 
the whole arcana of soup-making, without much trouble to herself, 
or expense to her employers. It would greatly diminish the ex- 
pense, and improve soups, if the agents employed to give them a 
zest were not put in above fifteen minutes before the finish, and 
half the quantity of spice, &c. would do. A strong heat soon dis- 
sipates the spirit of the wine, and evaporates the aroma and flavor 
of the spices and herbs, which are volatile in the heat of boiling 
water. 

Warm fluids, in the form of soup, unite with our juices much 
sooner and better than those that are cold and raw : on this ac- 
<;ount, RESTORATIVE SOUP is the best food for those who are en- 
feebled by disease or dissipation, and for old people, whose teeth 
and digestive organs are impaired. 

After catching cold, in nervous headaches, cholics, indigestions, 
and difiTerent kinds of cramp and spasms in the stomach, warm 
broth is of excellent service. 

After intemperate feasting, to give the stomach a holy day for a 
day or two by a diet on mutton broth, or vegetable soup, &c. is the 
best way to restore its tone. '* The stretching any power to its 
utmost extent weakens it. If the stomach be every day obliged to 
do as much as it can, it will every day be able to do less. A wise 
traveller will never force his horse to perform as much as he can 
in one day upon a long journey." 



OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN ARTICLES. 

We shall conclude these Introductory Observations, with a few 
remarks on the qualities of certain Articles in common use. 

BuUer. 

Well made pure butter is lenient and nourishing, eaten cold, 
in moderation, with bread. But upon hot new bread, or hot 
toast, or used as sauce to animal food, ij. is not wholesome. In 
the two first instances it is very apt to turn acid in the stomach; 
and in the latter, to float uppermost in the stomach, and disturb 
the digestion. If melted thick and carefully, and eaten with 
vegetable food and bread only, it is not so liable to this objection. 

Butter is good for dry, constipated habits, but not for such as 
are bilious, asthmatic, or corpulent. 



ZXnil OnSRVATlOHS. 

Hone J is nourishing and wholesome, particiilarlj for persons 
with coughs, weak lungs, and short breath. It is balsamic, 
cleansing, and makes the bodj soluble. 

Great care should be taken to get it fresh and pure; it is apt 
to turn sour by long keeping. 

Si^ar, 

Sugar used in moderation is nourishing and good, but much 
of it destroys the appetite, and injures the digestion. Moist 
sugar is the sweetest, and most opening; refined sugar, of a bind' 
ing nature. The preparations made of sugar, such as barley- 
sugar, sugar-candy, &c. are all indigestible and bad, as th^ good 
properties of the sugar are destroyed by the process it undergoes 
in the making them. They are particularly injurious to children, 
from cloying their delicate stomachs. Young children are in 

§eneral better without sugar, as it is very apt to turn acid and 
isagree with weak stomachs; and the kind of food they take 
has natural sweetness enough in it not at all to require it. 

Salt 

Salt, moderately used, especially with flesh, fish, butter, and 
cheese, is very beneficial, as it naturally stimulates weak or dis* 
ordered stomachs, and checks fermentations. But if it be im- 
moderately used it has a contrary effect. Very little salt should 
be used with vegetable food of the grain or seed kind; for the 
less salt that is put to it the milder, cooler, pleasanter, and easier 
of digestion it will be. Salt excites the appetite, assists the 
stomach in digesting crude phlegmatic substances, is cleansing, 
and prevents putrefaction; but if too much used, it heats and dries 
the blood and natural moisture. It is best for phlegmatic, cold, 
and moist stomachs; and most injurious to hot, lean bodies. 

Salt-petre is particularly bad for bilious persons. 

Vinegar, 

Vinegar is cooling, opening, excites the appetite, assists diges- 
tion, is good for hot stomachs, resists putrefaction, and there- 
fore very good against pestilential diseases. Too much use of it 
injures the nerves, emaciates some constitutions, is hurtful to the 
breast, and makes people look old and withered, with pale lips. 

The best vinegar is that which is made of the best wines. 
Lemon-juice and verjuice have much the same qualities and ef- 
fects as vinegar. 

The commonest vinegar is least adulterated. 

Mustard, 
Mustard quickens the appetite, warms the stomach, assists- in 
digesting hard meats, and dries up surperfiuous moisture. It sel- 
dom agrees with weak stomachs. 



OSiBftVAtlOlft. SOS 

Spiem. 

Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and ginger, may be esteemed 
the best of spices. 

Nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, and allspice, are generally 
productive of indigestion and headache to weak persons. 

Garlic, onions, rocambole, shallots, leeks, and horse-radish, 
are occasionally good for strong stomachs, but generally disa- 
gree with weak stomachs. 

Tea. 

The frequent drinking of a quantity of strong tea, as is the 
general practice, relaxes and weakens the tone of the stomach, 
whence proceeds nausea and indigestion, with a weakness of the 
nerves, and flabbiness of the flesh, and very oAen a pale wan 
complexion. Milk, when mixed with it in some quantity, lessens 
its bad qualities, by rendering it softer, and nutritious; and, with 
a moderate quantity of sugar, it may then be a proper breakfast, 
as a diluent, to those who are strong, and live freely, in order to 
cleanse the alimentary passages, and wash off the salts from the 
kidneys and bladder. But persons of weak nerves ought to ab- 
stain from it as carefully as from drams and cordial drops; as it 
causes the same kind of irritation on the tender delicate fibres of 
the stomach, which ends in lowness, trembling and vapors. 

It should never be drank hot by any body. Green tea is less 
wholesome than black or bohea. 

Coffee, 

Coffee affords very little nourishment, and is apt to occasion 
heat, dryness, stimulation and tremors of the nerves, and for 
these reasons is thought to occasion palsies, watchfulness, and 
leanness. Hence it is very plain that it must be pernicious to hot, 
dry, and bilious constitutions. If moderately used it may be 
\>enef]cial to phlegmatic persons, but, if drank very strong, or in 
great quantities, it will prove injurious even to them. 

The following remarks on Coffee, were published in London, 
by a physician. Ist. The raw coffee should be round and small 
grained, free from dirt and of a liffht color. It should have no 
appearance of mouldiness, and be kept quite free from any strong 
smell. It should not be long kept in sacks with other provisions, 
as there is no substance more apt to obtain strong and disagree- 
able odors from the presence of its neighbors. Hum injures it; 
and Miller even goes so far as to state that a few bags of pepper 
on board a ship from India upon one occasion spoiled the whole 
cargo. 

C2 



2nd. When the grains are large^ flat, and of a green color, 
they should be kept on hand, in a dry situation,^ a long time before 
use. Every West India planter knows this fact, although his 
interest often induces him to send the article to market before it 
is old and dry enough. 

3d. Roasting coflee is by far the most difficult operation of the 
housekeeper; when carried far enough, an aromatic oil is formeS 
by the heat and forces itself out upon the surface of the grains, 
giving them a glossy appearance, and an odor which is consider- 
ed their perfection; yet too little roasting prevents the aroma 
from appearing, and too much completely volatilizes it, leaving 
nothing but a fiat bitter taste. The heat should be strong and 
the operation shortened as much as possible without burning the 
grains. The roaster should be close or well covered all the time, 
and in order to improve the looks and flavor, a small piece of 
butter may be added to the coffee, while parching. 

4tb, Wnen thus prepared, coffee may be preserved for use in 
large quantities, without losing much of its .freshness, provided 
the vessels containing it be well covered. 

6th. An infusion of cofl^ee is better than a decoction, simply 
because the heat, in the last case, bting stronger and more last- 
ing, drives off* more of the aromatic oil. It is better, therefore, 
to grind the coffee very fine, and then to expose it, by means of 
a bag or strainer, to the action of boiling water, than to boil it 
any length of time. Heat, though unavoidable, injures the flavor, 
and the best coflTee I remember to have tasted was made by ex- 
posing the powder to a pressure of cold water; a tea-spoonful of 
this extract, thrown into a cup of hot water, was sufficient. It is 
not a bad method to allow the ground coflTee to lie in cold water 
between meals, and then prepare it by adding hot water. Just in 
proportion to the continuance of heat, in this and in the last 
operation,' the fragrance disappears, and is replaced by a strong 
bitter taste, which, according to the experiments of Chenevix, de- 
pends upon the presence of tannin (resembling that in tan bark). 
Koasting, besides forming this bitter substance, deprives the co^ 
fee of its nutritious qualities. 

Chocolate, 

Is rich, nutritious, and soothing, saponaceous, and cleansing; 
from which quality it often helps digestion, and excites the appe- 
tite. It is only proper for some of the leaner and stronger sort of 
phlegmatic constitutions, and some old people who are healthy, 
and accustomed to bodily exercise. 

Cocoa, 

Is of the same nature as chocolate, but not so rich; and tli6i^ 
fore lighter upon the stomach. 



OBSBBFATIOKS. jaOBk 

FruU. 

Fruits are bf different degrees of digestibility. Those of a hard 
texture, as some kinds of apples, melons/ apricots, several sorts 
of fleshy plums, and all immature fruits, are difficult of digestion. 

Strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, cherries, 
^tt^n-gages, peaches, nectarines, melting pears, mulberries, figs, 
^Kps, medlars, when all quite ripe, are more easily dissolved in 

Fruit, moderately eaten, is wholesome, particularly as correct- 
ing the grossness of animal food. But an excess of it, and es- 
pecially of unripe fruit, is productive of many diseases; amongst 
children in particular, it often occasions such as the nettle rash 
and St. Anthony's fire. 

Fruit invariably disagrees with bilious persons; but is a sover- 
eign remedy for the sea scurvy, and for diseases arising from an 
excess of animal food. 

JVW« and Almonds, 

i Most kinds of nuts, and almonds, from their milky or oily na- 
jive, contain a good deal of nourishment; but they require to be 
^iBll chewed, as they are difficult of digestion. Persons with 

w^ak stomachs should not eat them. The worst time at which 

they can be eaten is after a meal. 

Olives, 

Olives that have been gathered immature or unripe, and put into 
a pickle to keep them sound, are apt, especially if frequently eaten, 
to obstruct the stomach and passages. The best way of eating 
them is with good bread, when the stomach is properly empty. To 
eat them upon a full stomach is very bad.

Obs, — Poultry is in greatest perfection^ when in greatest plenty. 

The price of it varies as much as the size and quality of it^ and iks 
supply at market J and the demand for it. 

It is generally dearest from March to July^ and cheapest about S^ 
temhery when the Game season commences^ and the weather being eMer^ 
aUows of its being brought from more distant parts. 



MARKETING. XlXf 

2%e ahovt inforwuiii&n imU, we tru$tf he wry &eeepiabU to Eeanomi' 
eal TamUieSf who, from hearing the very high price PouUry sometimes 
costs, are deterred from ever inquiring about it. ht the cheap seoions 
wt have noted, it u som^im/es as cheap as Butcher-'meat. 

Those who pay the highest, do not always pay the dearest, price, Jn 
Jact, the Best Meat is the cheapest ; and those who treat a tradesman 
liberally, have a much heUer chance of being well served, than those who 
are forever bargaining for the Market Penny, In dividing the Joints, 
there is glways an opportunity of apportioning the Bones, Fat, Flaps, 
tfc, so as to make up a variation of much more than a penny per pound 
in most pieces ; and a Buieher will be happy to give the turn of his kntfe 
in favor of that Customer who cheerfully pays the fair price of the arti" 
c2e he purchases ; ha^e those who are unufilling to db so any reason to 
complain ? Have they not invited such conduct, 

DIRECTIONS FOR CURING AND COOKING PICKLED nSH.* 

The use o£ Pickled Fishy such as Mackerel, Salmon, Shad, &c. 
is becoming more general than formerly, and would be still more 
extensive if the proper mode of preparing them for the table was 
better unf^rstood. These fish constitute not only a salutary diet, 
but in many cases makes a very beneficial change in our food. 

Whoever will give the following directions a fair trial will be- 
come sensible of their value: — 

Fh*8t, The fish should be kept covered by the pickle by means 
of a flat stone or slate, laid on' them. The oil, or animal fat, 
which floats on the top of the cask, should not be removed, as it 
prevents the fish from rusting; but in taking the fish from the 
barrel or keg, this oil ought to be put aside, care being taken not 
to let the fish touch it. Secondly — The fish should be washed 
clean, then put to soak in a large quantity of water for eight or 
ten hours, with the flesh side down. The time of soaking may be 
varied to suit the palate. It must again be washed clean, put it 
to soak six or eight hours in milk, (if you have it) then dry it by 
the fire. Thirdly — When dry lay it on the gridiron, with the flesh 
side downward, over pretty lively coals, for five minutes, or till it 
is moderately browned, then turn it with a plate, or some flat in- 
strument that will not break the skin, and let it remain over the 
coals ten or fifteen minutes, or till it is cooked sufliciently. Slide 
it ofiT the gridiron into the dish, and strip ofiT the backbone with a 
broad knife: pat the fish, to cause the thick part of the fish to 
absorb the fat from the belly part; use no butter — ^then you .will 
enjoy all the flavor and juices of the fish. 

If a Mackerel or Shad so prepared does not relish, it must be 
more the fault of the palate, than of the food. How many arti- 
cles, capable of being made into excellent dishes, are lost or 
spoiled from want of care and skill in dressing them. 

* As the whole beauty of pickled Fish depends upon the right method of cooking it, we 
inaert by itself the receipt of Capt. Henry Purkitt, Massachusetts Inspector of Fish, who 
obiigin^j handed it to the Editor.

it, cover it with clarified butter, and keep it 
in a cool {^oe. If you have essence c^ancho-

add, while pounding tlie anchovies, a little 
niade mustaird and cuiry powder, or a few 
grains of Cayenne, or a little mace or other 
q>ioe. It may be made still more savoury, by 
^ring the toast in clarified butt^. — N.B. 
Keep your anchovies well covered; first tie 
down your jar with bladder moisteued with 
vulvar, and then wiped dry; tie leather

amies in half, core them, prick the skins with 
a Knife and throw them into cold water ; 
then put them into a pan with some clarified 
sugar, and stew them gently till tender ; place 
the apples in a dish, and pour the sirup 
through a sieve over them. 

APPLES COMPOTE. (2) Pare and 
cat half a dozen fine apples in half, and put 
^lem into a pan with a little water and lemon- 
juice ; then clarify half a pound of sugai-, and 
when you have skinuned it put iu your apples, 
and the juice of a lemon ; turn the apples 
fi^uently. As soon as you find the fork will 
penetrate them, th^ are sufficiently done, and 
may be taken out; strain and reduce the 
syrup ; strain it again, and then pour it over 
your apples, which may be sei-ved either hot 
or cold. Garnish with tlie peel of a very red 
apple, cut into various devices, and'laid on 
the apples. 

APPLES, WHOLE. The proceeding is 
the same as the last, except that the apples, 
when pared, ai'e not divided, and the cores 
are taken out with a piercer. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS.' Pare and 
Bcoop out the core of six large baking apples, 
put part of a clove, and a little grated lem- 
on-peel, inside of each, and enclose them in 
pieces of puff paste ;^ boil them in nets for 
the purpose, or bits of linen, for an hour. 
Before serving, cut off a small bit from the 
top of each, and put in a tea-spoonfiil of su- 
gar, and a bit of fi-esh butter ; replace the bit 
of paste, and strew over them pounded loaf 
mgar. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS, BAKED. 
Make them in the same way, but instead of 
tieing them in cloths lay them in a buttered 
dish and bake them. 

APPLES, DRIED OR BAKED. Al- 
ways choose the clearest of baking apples, 
prick them rather deep with a pointed knife 
in several places, and put them in a mode- 
rate oven upon a baking plate; when half 
done squeeze them pretty flat with the hands, 
strew them on both sides with powder sugar, 
and put them again into a soaking oven, 
with some more sugar over them. Keep 
tbem in a dry place. 

APPLES festooned; Peel some 
golden pippins, core them whole, and stew 



them to three parts with sugar and a little 
water; make the sirup pretty rich to clog

the juice of a lemon, and the whites of two 
eggs; beat them all together for an hour. 
Serve it upon rich cream, or a boiled cuetard, 
in a glass dish. It may be made in the same 
way as tlie gooseberi-y fool, as may also stew- 
ed rhubarb. 

APPLE FRAZE. Cut apples into thick 
slices, and fry them of a clear light Inrown; 
take them fi-om the pan, and ky them to 
drain ; diey may be pared or not ; then make

whites, beat them up with cream or flour, 
and a little white wine, make it of the con- 
sistence of pancake batter; pour in a little 
melted butter, mixed with nutmeg and sugar. 
Let the batter be hot, and drop in the fiitters, 
laying on every one a slice of apple, and then 
a spoonful of batter on each. Fry them of 
a pale brown, when taken up, strew double- 
refined sugar all over them.

anJes and leave the tails ; gore at the oppo- 
site side not quite through, and boil them 
with half a pint c^ red wine, some sugar, 
and a spoonful of brandy, simmer slowly that 
they may not break ; wnen ntsur\y done, take 
tfaem out, reduce tlie sinip to a caramel, and 
put in the spgiea, rubbing them all over with 
It ; or you may wmp them in a paste, rasp 
sugar over, bake a short time, and glaze with 
a white glaze. 

APPLE MARMALADE. (1) Boil 
some pippins till they begin to get tender, tlien 
put them into cold water; pare and core 
them; squeeze the pulp through a sieve and 
pot it over die fire, letting it i-emain till it be- 
comes very thick ; then weigli an equal quan- 
tity of fine sugar; boil it till the sugar arises in 
sparkles which cluster together; put the mar- 
malade to it, and stir them well with a wood- 
en ^poon till the apple begins to boil ; then 
take it off and when a little cool, put it into 
pots, but do not cover them till quite cold. 

APPLE MARMALADE. (2) Pare, 
ccare, and out your apples into small pieces, 
put them Into water with a litde kmon-iuice 
to keep them white. Take them out aner a 
short time smd drain them. Weigh, and put 
tbem into a stew^ian ; if for present use, half 
a pound of sugar will be sufScient for each 
pound of apples, but if for keeping, double 
that quantity wiU be necessary. Add to it a 
stick of cinnamon and the juice of a lemon.

ture till of the proper consistence: then pot 
the marmalade into pots. 

APPLES IN PANCAKES. Cut some 
apples very small, stew tliem with a littb 
white wine, grated lemon-peel, pounded cin- 
namon, and brown sugar; mash ihem, and

it a band of puff paste three-quarto's of an 
inch high and half an inch thick ; put your 
apples, &c. ill this so as to form a sort of 
dome, cover them with the puff paste, taiaiog 
care that it does nut extend beyond the bant^ 
upon which it must he pressed down ; wash 
it over wiUi white of e§^, and bake it 
in a gentle oven for about an hour. When 
a littHe cooled, take die whites of two ^^,

marmalade with some other apples, adding 
to it apricot marmalade, and four ounces of 
rice previousiv boiled in milk, with sugar and 
butter, and the yollu of two or three ega[s ; 
put them into a dish for table, sm-round it 
with a border of rice, and place the whole ap- 
ples in the rice, and marmalade and bake it. 
When done, put into each of the apples a tea 
spoonful of any kind of sweetmeat you may 
think proper. 

APPLES IN RICE. (2) Pare, core, 
and cut four or five good apples in quarters; 
boil some rice in a cloth, and when soft put 
in the apples, tie it up vei'y loose, and boil 
gently till sufficiently done. 

APPLE SOUFFLET. Prepare apples 
as for baking in a pudding, put them into a 
deep disli, and lay upon tlie top, about an 
inch and a half Uiick, rice boiled in ii^w 
milk with sugar; beat to a stiff froth die 
"Whites of two or three eggs, with a little sift- 
ed loaf sugar, lay it upon the rice, and buke 
it in an oven a light brown. S^'ve it instant- 
ly when done. 

APPLE A LA TURQUE. Neatly pare 
and pierce out the cores of eight or ten ap- 
ples, put them on the fire with a thin sirup 
of clarified sugar, cover them close and let 
them simmer gently ; turn them, that both 
aides may be done. When thoroughly done 
lay them on a dish, with a wet paper over 
them. Put a paste round the dish you serve 
them in, and bedce in a gentle oven to harden 
it, then put in a layer of apple sauce, over 
which put the apples, and fill the holes where 
the cores were with dried ciierries or ap- 
ricot jam, then cover it with the apple sauce ; 
beat up the whites of six eggs to a froth, 
and add powder sugar till tliey appear quite 
nnooth ; make the apples warm, and lay the 
white of egg ovef them, smooth it neatly over, 
and sift some powder sugar over it ; color it 
in a gentle ovod. 

APPLE WATER. Cnt three or four 
large apples mto slices, put them into a jug, 
and pour a quart of boilinp; water over them ; 
cover the jug. When quite cold, strain and 
■weeten it, and add a little lemon-juice. 

APRICOTS IN BRANDY. Weigh 
equal Quantities of loaf sugar and of apricots ; 
Bcald uiem, and take oif the skins. Clarify 
and boil the sugar, put the finit into it, and 
k€ it remain for two or three days ; put the 
apricots into glasi^. Mix with the sirup 
the best pale brandy, half and half, and pour 
it over the apricots and keep them closely 
<X)vered. Peaches and nectaiines may be 
done in the same way. 



APRICOTS, CHARLOTTE OP. 

Choose twenty-four fine, plump, but not too 
ripe, apricotd, pare and divide them into 
eight paits, toss tliem up in a quarter of a 
pound of fine sugar, and two ounces of warm 
butter ; in the meantime line a mould as <li- 
rected (see Charlotte); pour in the apri- 
cots, and finish as usual. When turned oo 
your dish, covei' it lightly with apricot mar- 
malade, and serve it immediately. 

APRICOTS TO DRY. Pare the apri- 
cots, and carefully take out the stones ; blanch 
the kernels, and put thein into the apricob; 
strew over a pound of fiiiit the same quanti^ 
of finely-pounded loaf sugar, and let then 
stand till the sugar Iras exti-acted Jthe juice, 
then boil all together gently ; when the finut 
is tender, take it out with care, and boil the 
sirup till very rich ; pour it over die fini^ 
and in three days put it upon dishes, and diy 
them in the sim under garden glasses, turning 
them once or twice a-day, to Keep thesfaiqie 
as round as possible. Any inferior apricoto 
may be cut down and boiled in the airtqp, tir 
tarts. 

APRICOT MARMALADE. Take 
some fine apricots, and choose firom amongrt 
them those which are of the deepest yeUow 
and the ripest, (they must not be too ripe.) 
Peel them, take out tlie stones, and chop them 
up ; weigh twelve pounds of them and pot 
them into a preserving-pan, with nine ptx^^ 
of powder sugar ; place your, pan over a (fii* 
fire, and keep youi* pi^eparation constanw 
stirring with a long wooden spoon. To find 
out when tlie marmalade is sufficienUy done, 
let a few drops fall into a glass of cold water, 
and if they do not spi-ead in tlie water yoV 
marmalade is ready to put into pots. An- 
other method of ascertaining when your mar- 
malade is done is by taking some on the end of 
your finger and thumb, and just rub th«n to- 
gether, and if on separating them yoQ fi^^^™^ 
marmalade forms a thread, it is sufficfcoBf 
done. 

APRICOTS A LA PORTUGAISE. 
Take a dozen of ripe apricots, cut them Bi 
half, and take out the stones ; place <1>^*^ 
a silver plate, and pour over some ckiiiwd 
sugar, with a little water; put them oo ■ 
stove without covering them; when suffi- 
ciently done, take them fiom the fire, aw 
strew sugar over ; dien put on the lid ofw*

ARTICHOKES AND ALMONDS. 
Take lialf a pound of sweet almonds blancii- 
ed and beat fine, with two tea spoonfuls 
of orange-flower or rose water ; tlieu Ud^e 
a quart of cream, and boil it with a suiail 
quantity of cinnamon and mare ; sweeten it

ARTICHOKES BOILED. Soak diem 
in coki water, wash them well, then put them 
into plenty of boiling water, with a haodlid 
of salt, and let them boil gendy till they are 
tender, which will take an hour and a half, 
or two hours: the surest wav to know wlicn 
dwy aie done «ioii^h, is'to cliiiw out a leaf; 
trim them and drain them on a sieve ; mid 
send up melted butter wiUi Uiem, which some 
put into small cups; so duit each guest may

ARTICHOKES TO BOIL. Cut off die 
stalks ck)ee to the bottom, wasli them well, 
and let them lie for some houis in cold wa-

ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS, to Dry 
AHD Pickle. Half boil the artichokes, 
strip off the leaves, and poll out the choke ; 
put the bottoms into small jai-s, and cover 
them with a cold boiled brine of salt and 
water ; put melted mutton sjet on die top to 
exclude the air, and tie bladder over them. 
To dry them, tliev are boiled as for eating, 
the leaves and cheke puUed out, and the bot- 
toms dried upon diahee in an oven, and then 



kept in paper Imfg^ When lo be dreMed, 
they must be laid uito warm nvater, and soak-

BAC 



■crape all the stallu till they are perfectly 
clean ; throw them into a pan of cold water as 
you scrape them ; when they are all done, tie 
them up in little bundles, of about a quarter 
of a hundred each, with bass, if you can get 
it, or tape (strin? cuts them to pieces ; ) cut 
off the stalks at Uie bottom that they may be 
all of a lenffth, leaving only just enough to 
serve as a handle for the ereen part; when 
they are tender at the sta^, which will be 
in from twenty to thirty minutes, they ai'e 
done enough. Great care must be talcen to 
watch the exact time of their becoming ten- 
der; take them up just at that instant, and 
they will have their true flavor and color: 
a minute or two more boiling destroys both. 
While the asparagus is boiling, toast a round 
of a quaitem loaf, about half an inch thick ; 
brown it delicately on both sides; dip it 
lightly in the liquor the asparagus was boiled 
in, and lay it in the middle of a dish : melt 
aome butter, then lay in the asparagus upon 
the toast, which must project beyond die as- 
paragus, that the company may see there is 
a toast. 

ASPARAGUS, BOILED. Scrape and 
tie them in small bundles;' cut them even, 
boil them quick in salt and water ; lay theui 
on a toast dipped in the water the asparagus 
was boiled in ; poor over them melted butter. 

ASPARAGUS AND EGGS. Toast a 
slice of bread, butter it, and lay it on a dish ; 
butter some eggs thus: take tour eggs, beat 
them well, put them into a sauc^ pan with 
two oimces of butter, and a little salt, until 
of a sufficient consistence, and lay them on 
the toast; meanwhile boil some asparagus 
tender, cut the ends small, and lay them on 
the cg^, 

ASPARAGUS, FRENCH. Boil it, and 
chop small the heads and tender pait of the 
stalks, together with a boiled onion ; add a 
little sak and pepper, and the beaten yolk of 
an egg; beat it up. Serve it on sippets of 
toasted bread, and pour ovor it a little melt- 
ed butter. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. (See Soups.) 

ASPICK. Take a knuckle of veal, a 
knuckle of ham, a thick slice of beef, and if 
diey will not make your jelly stiff enough, 
add two calPs leet, or some swards of bacon 
ra^)ed ; put them into a sauce-pan with a pint 
of rich stock, and sweat it over a stove till 
reduced to a glaze, then moisten it with stock, 
boil and skim it well. Put to it two onions, 
two carrots, salt, parsley, scallions, four cloves, 
two bay leaves, and a clove of garlick ; let 
the whole stew for seven hours, tlien strain off 
the liquor or conaomme. Break four eggs 



into a stewpan, and pot to them the eonsomiM 
wlien cold, the juice of two lemons, and two 
spoonfuls of tarragon, and beat it with a 
whisk over the fu'e till near boiling, and when 
it does so, remove your stew-pan to a smaller 
fire, and place fire on the lid for half an hour; 
then pass it through a wet napkin doubled. 
If the jelly is not sufficiently clear, clarify it 
a second time. Put a layer of this jelly, about 
half an inch tliick, at the bottom of an aspick 
mould, garnish it with truffles, whites of ^[gs, 
sprigs of parsley, &c. according to your taste, 
pour in another half inch of the jelly, while 
liquid, with great cai-e, so as not to discom* 
pose your garnish, then put either calf's 
brains, breasts of fowl, veal sweetlnncads, 
cocks' combs, kidneys, fat livers, or game. 
Be sure to lay whatever vou may use, as equal 
and smootl) as possible, then fill up your mould 
with jelly, and let it sUmd till set. When 
wanted, dip the mould in hot water an in- 
stant, place your dish on the top and turn it

BACCHIC CREAM. (See Cream,) 

BACCHIC SAUCE. (See Sauee.) 

BACON. Cover a pound of nice streaked 
bacon or salt pork with cold water, let it boil 
gently for three-quarters of an hour ; take it 
up, scrape tlie under side well, and cut off 
the rind : grate a crust of bread not only on 
the top, but all over it, and put it before the 
fire for a few minutes: it must not be there 
too k)ng, or it will dry it and spoil it. Two 
pounds will require aSout an hour and a half, 
according to its thickness ; the hock or gam- 
mon being very thick, wiH take more. The 
boiling of bacon is a vei'y simple subject to 
comment upon; but our main object is to 
teach common cooks the art of dressing com- 
mon food in the best manner. Bacon is 
sometimes as salt as salt can make it, tliere- 
fore before it is boiled it must be soaked in 
warm water for an hour or two, changing 
the water once ; then pare off the rusty and. 
smoked part, trim it nicely on tlie under side, 
and scrape the rind as clean as possible. 
3Iem. — Bacon is an extravagant article in 
housekeeping ; there is often twice as much 
di-essed as need be: when it is sent to ta- 
ble as an accompaniment to boiled pouhiy

vary ecoDomical substitnte for bacon ; or fried 
pcnrk sausages. 

Note. — Baeim in England and boU 
pork in America art the tame thing* 
What we name bacon, the EngHeh call 
kam. 

BAOON TO BROIL. Make np a sheet 
<^ paper into the form of a dripping-pan ; cut 
vour bacon into thin slices, cut on the rind, 
by the bacon on the paper, put it upon the 
eridiron, set over a .slow fire, and it will 
broil cleanly. 

BACX)N AND EGGS. Cut a quarter of 
a pound of streaked bacon into thin slices, 
aDd put them into a stewpan over a slow fire, 
taking care to turn tliem frequently; when 
siiffici^itly done, pour tlie melted fat of the 
bacon into a dish, break over it seven or eiglit 
eggs, add two spoonfuls of gravy, a little 
salt and i)epper, and stew the whole over a 
8k>w fire: pass a salamander over it, and 
serve. 

BACON, GAMMON, TO BAKE. Lay 
it to steep all night in water, scrape it clean, 
and stofT it with all manner of sweet herbs, 
as thyme, sage, savory, sweet marjoram, pen- 
Dy-roval, strawberry l^ives, violet leaves, and 
fesnel; chop these small, and mix them with 
the yolks of hard ^gs, peppei* and nutmeg 
beaten, and boil it until teiMier. When it is 
cold pare off tlw under side, pull off the skin, 
season it with pepper and nutmeg, and put it 
in a pie or pasty, with whole cloves and slices 
(^raw bacon laid over it, and butter ; close it, 
and bake it. 

BACON OR HAM SLICES. Ham, or 
bacon, may be fi'ied, or broiled on a gridiron 
over a clear fire, or toasted with a fork : take 
care to slice it of die same thickness in every 
part. If you wish it curled, cut it in slices 
about two inches long (if longer, the outside 
will be done too much before the inside is 
done enough); roll it up, and put a little 
wooden skewer through it: put it m a clieese- 
toaster or Dutch oven, for ei^t or ten minutes, 
turning it as it gets ci'isp. This is considered 
the handsomest way of dressing bacon ; but 
we like it best uncurled, because it is crisper, 
and more equally done. Slices of ham or 
bacon ^ould not be more than half a quarter 
of an inch thick, and will eat much more 
mellow if soaked in hot water for a quarter 
of an hour, and then dried in a cloth before 
th^ are broiled, &c. 

BACON RELISHING RASHERS. 
If yon have any cold bacon, you may make 



a Tery nice dish of it by cnttiiw it intostieea 
aboat a quarter of an inch thick; grate sooib 
crust of bread, as directed for ham and pow- 
der them well with it oo both sides; lay the 
rashers in a cheese-toaster, th^ wiU be 
browned on one side in about three roinutes, 
tm-n them and do tlie other. These are a 
delicious accompaniment to poached or fried 
eggs: the bacon having been boiled first, is 
tender and mellow. They are an excel^nt 
garnish round I'eal cutlets, or sweetlHvads, 
or calTs head had), or green peas or beans, 
&c. 

BAIN MARIE. A flat vessel, contam- 
ing boiling water, meant to hold other sauce- 
pans, either for purposes of cookery or to keep

that no change is effected in the flavor <^

BECHAMELLE. Redooe some 
toumee over a good fire, moisten with chick- 
en broth or eomomme, constantly stirring to 
prevent its catching; idienof the'properooiH 
sistence, add two glasses of boilmg cream, 
continue stirring ; pass it through a hair sieve 
and serve. 

. BECHAMEL, OR WHITE SAUCE. 
Cut in square pieces, half an inch thick, two 
pounds of lean veal, half a pound of lean ham; 
melt in a stewpan two ounces of batter; 
when melted, let the whole simmer until it 
is ready to catch at tlie bottom (it requires 
great attention, as, if it happen to catch at 
the bottom of the stewpan, it will spoil the 
look of your sauce) ; then add to it three 
table-spoonfiils of flour ; when well mixed, 
add to it three pints of broth or water (pour 
a litde at a time, that the thickening be 
smooth) ; stir it until it boil; put the stew- 
pan on the comer of the stove to boil sently 
fiir two hours; seascm it with lour cloves, 
one onion, twelve pepper-corns, a blade of 
mace, a few mushrooms and a fiigot made 
of parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf. 
Let the sauce reduce to a quart, skim the &t 
off, and strain it through a tamis doth. To 
make a bechamel sauce, add to a quart of 
the above a pint of good cream; stir it until 
it is reduced to a good thickness; a few 
mushrooms give a good flavor to that Huioe; 
strain it through a tamis cloth. 

BEEF. The names of the various piece!, 
according to the method of dividing the car- 
case, are as follows:— The hind quarter con- 
tains the Sirloin; Rump; Edge4x>ne; ]^t- 
tock, or Round; Mouse Buttock; Vemy 
Piece; Thick Flank; Thin Flank; L^ 
Ran; Legs; Fore Rib; Five Ribs.— The 
fore quai'ter contains the Middle Rib of four 
ribs ; Chuck of three ribs ; Shouldo*, or Leg- 
of-Mutton Piece, containing a part of the 
Blade-bone ; Brisket ; Clod ; Neck End, or 
Sticking Piece; Shin; Cheek. Besides 
these ai-e the Tongue and Palate. The En* 
trails consist of the Heart; Sweetbreads; 
Kidne}'8; Skirts; and three kinds of Tripe* 
the Double, the Roll, and the Red Tripe. 

Ox beef is considered the best. The fledl 
should feel tender, be fine in the grain, and 
of a bright red color, nicely marblra cr mix* 
ed with fet. The iatshould be white, rather 
than of a yellow color. 

Heifer beef is excellent when finely fed, 
and is most suitaUe for small fiunilies. Hie 
bone should be taken out of a round <^beef 
before it is salted, and it must be washed, 
skewered, and bound round firmly befiire be- 
ing boiled. Salt beef should be put on with

yhiity of oold water, aad when k IxHli the 
■eam removed. It it tiwn kept mmaKriiig 
far Mome hours. A piece weighing fifteen 
pounds will require three hooniandahsJf to 
Doil. OuTots and tnniips for gamishiiiff 
■hoold be fNit on to boil with the beef. If 
in the least tainted, a piece of dianxial nay 
W boiled with it. 

When beef is to be kept any length of time, 
it should be carefiilly wiped every day. In 
warm weathor, wood vinegar is an excellent 
preservative: it is put all over the meat with 
a brudi. To protect the meat fix>m flies, it 
may be sprinkled over with pepper. Tainted 
meat may be restiHed by washing in oold 
water, afterwards in stroi^ chamomile tea, 
after which it ma^ be sprinkled with salt and 
nsed the foUowing day, first washing it 
in cfM water. Roughly pounded charcoal 
rvMaed all over the meat also restores it when 
tainted. In Scotland meat is frequently kept 
a £>rtnigfat smothered in oatmeal, and care- 
fiilly wiped every day ; and if it should be a 
little tainted, it is soaked some hours before 
it is used, in oatmeal amd water. 

These directions equally apply to all sMts 
ef meat. The sirloin is the wime joint ftn* 
roasting. When to be used, it should be 
washed, then dried with a clean ck>th, and 
the £it cov»^ over with a piece of white pa- 
per tied on with thread. The spit should be 
kept at aU times exceedingly clean: it must 
be wiped dry immediately after it is drawn 
from the meat, and washed and scoured evcFv 
time it is used. Care should be taken to bal- 
ance the roast properly upon the spit, but, if 
not exactly right, it is better to make it equal 
by fiistaung on a leaden-headed skewer than 
to pierce it again. The fire should be pre- 
pared by putting on plenty of coals at the 
Dack. When put down, it should be about 
ten iacbea 6rom the fire, and ^'adually drawn 
nearer. It is first basted with a little butter 
or fi^ei^ dripping, and then well basted with 
its own &t all the tiipe it is roasting. Ten 
minutes before serving, it should be sprinkled 
with a little salt, then diedged with flour, and 
basted tiU it is fi-othed. When it is drawn 
finom the spit some gravy will run out, to 
ishkh may be added a little boiling salt^and- 
water poured along the bone: the mef is then 
garnished with plenty of finely scraped horse- 
radisli. A sirloin, weighing about fifteen 
pounds, should be roasted for three hours and 
a half. A thinner piece of the same weight 
tequires only three hours. In cold weather 
meat requires longer roasting than in wsuin, 
and if newty killed than if it has been kept. 

BEEF ALAMODE. (I) Take about 
cfevoi pounds of the mouse buttock, or clod 
qfbeef, or a blade4x>ne, or the sticking-piece, 
or the like weight of the breast of veal ; cut 
it into pieces of three or four ounces each; pai

quite hot, flour the meat, put it into the stew- 
pan, keep stirring it witn a wooden spoon} 
when it tos been on about ten minutes, oredj f B 
it with floor, and keep doing so till you hav« 
stirred in as much as you think will thicken 
it; then cover it with boiling water (it will 
take about a galkm), adding it by degrees, 
and stirring it together ; skim it when it boils, 
and then put in one drachm of ground Mack 
pepper, two of allspice, and two bay leaves; 
set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a dis- 
tance over it and let it stew very slowly for 
about three hours; when you find the meat 
sufficiently tender, put it into a tureen, and 
it is ready S» table. 

BEEF ALAMODE. (2) Take the 
bone out of a small round of fine ox beef, cut 
some fiit bacon in lon^ strips, dip them into 
common and shallot vinegar nuxed, and roQ 
them in the following seasoning: Grated nut- 
m^, black and Jamaica peppo*, one or tvro 
cloves, and some salt, parsl^, chives, lemon- 
thyme, notted manoram, and savoury, shred 
quite small. Lard the beef very thickly, bind 
it firmly with tape, and rub the outside with 
the seasoning. Put it into a saucqian, with 
the rind pf a lemon, four large onions, the red 
part of three or four carrots, and two turnips 
cut into dice ; add a tea-cupfiil of strong ale 
and one of vinegar ; let it stew for six or eight 
hours, turning it two or three times. Half 
an hour before Mrving, take out the beef and 
vegetad)leB, skim off the fot, strain the sauce, 
and thicken it with a little flour-and-water 
mixed smooth, add a tea.«upful of Port wine, 
retmn it all into the pot, and let it boil. 

BEEF ALAMODE. (3) Take a romp 
or piece of beef, bone it, heaX it well and lard 
it with fot baocMi, then put it into a stewpan 
with some rind of bacon, a calf's foot, an 
onion, carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs, a bay 
leaf, thyme, a clove of garlic, some cloves, 
salt, and pepper, pour over the whole a glass 
of water, let it stew over a sbw fire for six 
houra at least. A clean cloth should be 
placed over the stew pan before the lid is 
put on, which must be carefol^y ckwed. 
When it is done, strain the gravy through a 
sieve, clear off the fot, and serve. 

BEEF ALADAUBE. Take a round, 
a rump, or a veiny piece of beef, lard it with 
bacon, half roast it, or firy it brown; put it 
into a stewpan or a pot that will just hold 
it; add some gravy, an onion stix^ widi 
cloves, half a pint of white wine, a gill of 
vinegar, a bunch of sweet horbs, pepper, 
cloves, mace, and salt; cover it down very 
close, let it but just simmer till it is tender';

together in some graw, and pour over the 
Ibeef; have ready some forced meat balls fried, 
make some long, others round, dip some sip- 
pets into batter, fry and cut them three cor- 
ner ways, and stick them into the meat; lay 
the balls round the dish. 

BEEF ALABRAISE. (1) Bone a 
romp of beef; lard it very thickly with salt 
pork seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, 
and allspice, and season the beef with pepper 
and salt; put some slices of bacon into the 
bottom of tlie pan, with some whole black pep- 
per, a litde allspice, one or two bay leaves, two 
onions, a clove of garlic, and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. Put in the beef, and lay over it 
some slices of bacon, two quarts of weak 
stock, and half a pint of white wine. Cover 
it closely, and let it stew between six and 
seven hours. Sauce for the beef is made of 
pait of the liquor it has been stewed in, 
strained, and thickened with a little flour and 
butter, adding some green onions cut small, 
and pickled mushrooms. It is poured hot 
over the beef. 

BEEF ALABRAISE. (2) After a 
rump of beef has hung fur five or six days, 
bone, and lard it thickly, but so as not to ap- 
pear upon tlie surface, with bits of salt pork 
or ham cut about haU* an inch squai'e, and 
rolled in the following seasoning well mixed: 
— ^Finely minced onion, parsley, thyme, a lit- 
tle garlic, pepper, and rait. W hiU is left over 
of the seasoning add to a pint of vinegar, one 
of Port wine, and a tea-cupful of salad oil ; 
steep the beef in this for one night; the fol- 
lowing day paper it, and roast it in a cradle 
spit. Baste it well, and serve it with a thick 
brown gravy. A little lemon-juice and sliced 
pickled cucumbers may be added. Garnish 
with slices of boiled carrot and scraped horse- 
radisli. 

BEEF ALANGLAISE. Take a rump 
of beef, or any piece you like better of the 
same size ; tie it up neatly with packthread, 
and put it into a stewpan with two or three 
carrots, a parsnip, three sr four onions, a 
bunch of pursleyand green onions, a clove of 
garlic, a bay leaf, thyme, and basil ; moisten 
with some stock or water, season, and let 
tfie beef stew gently till half done, then put in 
a few small cwbages, prepared in the follow- 
ing manner; boil a \aScge cabbage, and hav- 
ing squeezed it perfectly dry, take off the 
leaves one by one, and pot within each leaf 
a little veal or other forcemeat, surrounding 
it with three or four more of the leaves, in 
such a manner as to form little cabbages, 
something larger than an egg ; tie these with 
packthread, and let them be stewed with the 



beef. When the wbole is dote, dsaii mtrnf 
the outside loose fat, and put your berf m ft 
dish, cut the little cabbaj^es in lalf, and phofl ' 
them round the dish, with the cut side out* 
ward. Take a little of the stew, strain it 
through a sieve, and having diimmed off die 
&t, add a little cullis to thicken it. Reduce 
this over the fire to the consistence of a sauoSi 
serving it over the meat and cabbages. 

BEEF BALLS. Mince very finely a 
piece of tender beef, fiit and lean ; mince an 
onion, with some boiled parsley ; add grated 
bread crumbs, and season with pepper, salt, 
grated nutmeg, and lemon^eel; mix aU U^ 
getlier, and moisten it with an egg beaten; 
roll it into balls ; flour and firy them in hoit 
ing fresli dripping. Serve them with firied 
bread crumbs, or with a thickooed brown 
gravy. 

BEEF BOUILLI. (1) In plain Engw 
lisfa, is understood to mean boiled beef; but 
its culinary acceptation, in the French kitch- 
en, is freshbeef dressed widiout boiling, and 
only very gently simmered by a slow fire. 
Cooks have seldom any notion, that good soup 
can be made without destroying a great deal 
of meat ; however, by a judicious regulation 
of the fire, and a vigilant attendance on the 
soup-kettle, diis may be accomplished. Yon 
shall have a tureen of such soup as will satisfy 
the most festidious palate, and the meat make 
its appearance at table, at the same time, in 
possession of a full portion of nutritious succu- 
lence. This requires nothing more than to 
stew the meat very slowly (instead of keeping 
Xhe pot boiling a gallop, as common oodts 
too commonly do), and to take it up as soml- 
as it is done enough. See " Soup and 
bouilli," " Beef Shin stewed," « ScotA 
barley broth." Meat cooked in this manner 
affoixis much more nourislunent than it does 
dressed in the common way, is easy of diges- 
tion in proportion as it is tender, and an in- 
vigorating, substantial diet, especially valua- 
ble to the poor, whose laborious employmoiti 
require support. 

BEEF BOUILLI. (2) Take a nmip 
of beef) or part of one ; bone and tie it t(^;etb* 
er in a neat form, and put it into a pot, with 
any odd bits of butcher's meat you may hap- 
pen to have in the house, either beef, veal, or 
mutton ; you may add, also, the bones, feet, 
and necks of poultry or game, the meat of 
which has been taken for other dishes ; place 
your pot on a moderate fire, not quite fUI of 
Mrater, and skim gently. When it has boiled 
a short time, put in some salt, turnips, six 
carrots, and six onions, into one of which yoa 
should stick three cloves; add a bunch of 
leeks. Let the whole boil gently, till the beef 
is perfectly done; then take it out, and i

through a silk siei'e, reduce it, and serve it 
as a sauce to your meat. 

BEEF FILLET ROASTED. This fil- 
let lies only in the inside of the sirloin next 
to the chine, and is die tenderest part of the 
ox ; spit this on a somll spit, but do not ran 
it tlirough the best part of the meat: roast it 
gently, and baste it with butter ; catch ^ravy 
m a dish while the beef is roasting ; in the 
meantime make a sauce for it with sweet 
lierfas and parsley shred fine, the yolks of four 
e^;8, an onion, and some orange-peel cho|^

BEEF GRAVY. {See Gravy.) 

B£EF H-BONE. Is to be managed in 
flOEactly the same manner as the round, but 
will be sooner boiled, as it is not so solid. 
jAjd H-bone of !^bs. will be done enough in 
about four hours; of lOlbs. in three hours, 
more or less, as tlie weatlier is liotter or 
oolder. Be sure the boiler is big enough to 
allow it plenty of water-room: let it be well 
covered with water: set the pot on one side 
of the fire to boil gentl;^: if it boils quick at 
first, no art can miike it tender after. The 
abwer it boils, the better it will look, and 
the tenderer it will be. The same ^uscom- 

Smying vegetables as in "Beef Salt Round." 
ress plenty of carrots, as cold carrots are a 
general favorite with cold beef. Mem, — 
Epicures say, that the so/f , ^-like marrow, 
which lies on the back, is delicious when hot, 
and the hard fat about the ui^per comer is 
best when cold. 

BEEF HASHED. (1) Take three or 
lour onions, chop them very fine, and put them 
into a stewpan, with a piece of butter and 
a little flour; stir it over the fire till nearly 
done and well browned; then moisten them 
with a little stock and half a glass of wine. 
Adding some salt and coarse pe{^r; let them 
stew till they are thorough^ done, and very 
litde sauce remains; then put in the cold 
beef, minced small, and let the whole sim- 
mor till it has taken the flavor of the onion. 
When you serve, add a qx)OQfi]l of mustard 
and a httle vinegar. 

BEEF HASHED. (2) Cut some of 
the underdone part of the beef, in slices, 
with some- of the £aX, put it into a small 
stewpan, with scune onion or diallot, (a 
▼ery little will do), a little water, pepper, 
and salt: boil it till the onion is quite soft, 
then put some of the gravy of the meat to it, 
and the hash. Do not let it boil; have a 
■mall hot dish with sippets of bread ready, 
and put the hash into it, but first mix a large 
i|K>onfiil of vinegar with it ; if sballot vinegar 
is used there will be no need of the onion or

over it half a pound of common salt. Let it 
lie fifteen days, turning it daihr. It is theo 
hang up; <»" when taken out of the pickle, it 
may be boiled, and allowed to stand till cold 
in the water in which it was boiled; qr it 
may be baked in a deep dish, covered wil^ 
a coarse paste. 

BEEF HEART, TO ROAST. Wash 
it well, and clean all the blood carefiilly fitMS 
the pipes: parboil it ten or fifteen minutes in 
boiling water; drip the water finom it; put 
in a eriUifiing which has been made of bre^id 
crumbs, minced suet or, butter, sweet maijc^ 
ram, lemon thyme, and parsley, season- 
ed with salt, pq}par, and nutmeg. Put it 
down to roast while hot, baste it well with 
butter, fix>th it up, and serve it with melted 
butter and vinegar; or with gravy in the 
dish, and oui'rent jelly in a sauce-tureen. 
To hash it, follow the directions given fat 
hare. 

BEEF HUNG, BURGESS'S METH- 
OD OF BOH.ING. Hun^ beef for giat- 
ing should be put on in boiling water, and, 
to preserve the color, kept boiling as fest as 

Cible. Allow for six pounds of beef one 
and a half. It will keep good for a 
length of time.

roasted fiUet of beef, cut out all the fiit and 
suet, then chop the meat as fine as posBible, 
and put it into a redjuotd Spanish sauce mnde 
boiling hot; when ready to serve, add a bit 
of butter to it. Serve your mince with soft 
boiled e^s round it, or widi pieces of toast*

ing to your taste, then let it simmer over a 
gentle fire till it is si]^cient)y done. 

BEEF OLIVES. Qit the beef into long 
thin steaks; prepare a forcemeat made of 
bread-crumbs, mmoed beef suet, chopped 
parsley, a httle grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, 
pepper, and salt; bind it with the volks of 
eggsbeiUen; pot a layer of it over each steak; 
roll and tie them widi thsead. Fry them

paa with some good mx>wn gravy, a glass of 
white wine, and a little Cayenne; thicken it 
with a little flour and butter; cover the pan 
dosely, and let them stew gendv an hour. 
Before servii^, add a table-simonnil of mush- 
room catchup; garnish with cut pickles. 

BEEF AND OYSTER SAUSAGES. 
Scald three-quarters of a pint of oysters in 
their own Kquor; take them out and chop them 
finriy ; minoe one pound of beef and mutton, 
■Dd*tiireeK]tBrten of a ponad of beef suet;

and for sandwiches. 



BEEF POTniD. Take 

of lean beef, salt it two or three days witk 
half a pound of common salt, and half aa 
ounce of saltpetre; divide it into pieces of a 
pound each, and put it into aa earthen mb 
just sufficient to contain it; poor in half a 
pint of water ; cover it close with paste, and 
set it in a very slow oven for four hours: whea 
tak^i fit>m the oven pour the gravy fiiom it 
into a basin, shred the meat fine, moisten it 
with the gravy poured firom the meat, and 
pound it thorougnlv io a marUe mortar with 
fre^ butter, till it l)ecomc8 a fine paste, sea- 
son it widi black pepper and allspice, or 
cloves pounded, or gi-ated notneg ; put it ill 
pots, press it down as close as possible, put 
a weight on it, and let it stand all night; 
next £by, when it is quite cold, cover it a 
quarter of an inch thick with clarified butter, 
and tie it over with paper. 

BEEF SALT ROUND. As this ■ 
too large for a moderate family, we shal 
write directions for the dressing Haifa round. 
Gret the tongue side. Skewer it up tight and 
round, and tie a fillet of hrceA tape round it, 
to keep the skewers in their pbces. Put it 
into plenty of cold water, and carefoDy 
catch the scum as soon as it rises: let it bofl 
till all die scum is removed, and then put the 
boiler on one side of the fire, to keep stn^ 
merir^ slowly till it is done. Hhlf a round 
of 15Ibs. will take about three hours: if it 
weighs more, give it more time. When yoa 
take it up, if any stray scum, Stc. sticks to 
it diat has escaped the vigilance of your skim* 
mer, wash it off with a paste-brush : garnish 
the dishes with carrots and turnips. Send 
up carrots, turaips, and parsnips, or greens 
&c. on separate dishes. Peas pudding, and 
MT PODDING, are all very proper accom^ 
panimentB. N. B. — ^The outside slicei^ 
which are generally too much salted and too 
mudi boiled, will make a very good relish aa 
potted beef. For using up the remains of m 
joint of boiled beef, see also Bubble and 
Squeak. 

BEEF RAGOUT. Take a ramp of brn^ 
cut the meat fi^m the bcMie, flour and fry i^ 
poor over it a little boiling water, about a 
pint of smaU beer; add a carrot or two, aa 
onion stuck with cloves, some whole pepper, 
salt, a piece of lemon-peel, a bunch of sweet 
herbs; let it stew an hour, then add some 
good gravy; when the meat is tender tilwit

flour; add a little odery ready boiled, a little 
catchup, put in the meat, just simmer it up. Or 
the celery may be omitted, and the ragout en- 
riched by addmg mushrooms fresh w pickled, 
artichoke4)ottoms boiled and quartered, and 
hard ^olks of e^s. A piece of flank, or 
any piece that can be cut free fixMn brae, 
wul do instead of the rump. 

BEEF RISSOLES. CSiop finely a 
pound of lean tender beef, and a quarter of a 
pound of beef suet ; pomid them m a marble 
mortar ; mix with it a quarter of a pound of 
grated bread, a little onion, and a head of 
sarlick tnuised ; season with sah and peppor; 
bind it with three ^|gii well beaten ; make it 
np into small cakes, fiy them of a light brown, 
then stew them in gravy for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. 

BEEF RIBS BONED AND ROLLED. 
When you have kept two or three ribs c^ 
beef till quite tender, take out the bones, and 
skewer it as round as possible (like a fillet 
of veal): before they roil it, some cooks egg 
it, and sprinkle it with veal stuffing. As the 
meat is more in a solid mass, it will require 
more time at the fire ; a piece of tenor twelve 
pounds weight will not be well and thoroughly 
roasted in less than four and a half hours. 
For the first half hour, it should not be less 
than twelve inches from the fire, that it may 

St gradually warm to the centre: the last 
If hour before it will be finished, sprinkle 
a little salt over it; and if you wicdi to firoth 
it, flour it, &c» 

BEEF RUMP BAKED. Take a rump 
of beef, what size you please, bone and lard 
it, season it with salt and fine spices put it 
into a stewpan just large enough to hold it, 
together with hafra pint of white wine, some 
ffreen onions, mushrooms, and shallots ; some 
jtean bacon is an improvement. Ckiee the 
edges of the pan with a strong paste ; let it 
■tew in an oven for five or six boin« according 
to the size of your meat, then serve it* with 
its own sauce strained. You may dress a sir- 
loin in the same way. 

BEEF RUMP TO STEW. (1) Bind 
the beef tightly, stick in four cloves, and put 
it in a saucepan, with three quarts of water, 
a quarter of an ounce of black pe|^)er half 
beaten, some sah, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and three anchovies ; turn it often, and when 
half done take it out, pour off the liquor ; put 
in the beef again, with a pint of Port wine 
and half a pint of taUe beer made scalding 
hot, and some of the liquw strained ; stew it 
tin tender, clear off the &t, and if the sauce 
it not strong enough, add well-seasoned beef 
fravy; thicken it with flour nibbed down ta 



a little cold water. Didli the bei^ and poor 
the gravy round it. 

BEEF RUMP TO STEW. (2) Tie 

up the beef, and put it on to stew with nearif 
as mudi cold water as wiU cover it; add three 
pounds of fot bacon cut into slices, a tiafMHiJ 
of thyme, eight onions, four small carrots, 
two turnips, two or tknee bay leaves, aonie 
black peppor, a little aHq)ioe, aiaoe, and 
three cloves, a pint of Port wine and one off 
Sherry. Let it stew gently between eevcB 
and eight hours. Take out the beef, strain 
the liquor, and skim off all the fitt ; diicken 
it with a little flour rubbed ^own in cold 
water, boil it up, and pour it over the beef. 
Have ready carrots and turnips, cut accord- 
ing to foncy, and boiled tender in weak gra^ 
vy, and put them round the beef before serv- 
ing. 

BEEF RUMP-STEAKS STEWED. 
The steaks must be a little thicker than fx 
broiling: let them be all die scune thickness, 
or some will be done too little, and othors too 
much. Put an ounce of butter into a stew- 
pan, with two onions; when the butter is 
melted, lay in the rump<steaks, let them stand 
over a slow fire for five minutes, then tnra 
th»m and let the other side vi them fry for 
five minutes bimo*. Have ready boiled a 
pint of button onions; they will take from 
half an hour to an hour; put the liquor they 
were boiled in to the steaks; if there is not 
enough of it to cover them, add broth or boil- 
ing water, to make up enough for that purpose, 
with a dozen corns of Uack pepper, and a 
little salt, and let them simmer very gently 
for about an hour and a half, and thai strain 
off as much of the liquor (about a pint and 
a half) as yon think will make the sanoe. 
Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan; 
when it is melted, stir in as much flour as 
will make it into a stiff paste; aome add 
thereto a table^pomful of claret, or Port 
wine, tlie same of mushroom catchup half a 
tea'Sporaifiil of salt and a quaiter of a tea- 
spoonful of ground Uack pepper: add the 
licjuor by degrees ; let it boil up for fifteea 
minutes; skim it, and strain it; serve up the 
steaks with tiie onions round the di8h,and pov 
the gravy over. Veal cutlets or mutton <»ops 
may be done the same way, or as vea) oHyes. 

BEEF RUMP-STEAK BROILED 
WITH ONION GRAVY. Peel and slice 
two large onions, put them into a quart stew- 
pan, with two tabte-spopnfiils of wator ; cover 
die stewpan close, oiid set it on a slow fire 
till die water has boiled avray, and the <miani 
have got a little browned ; then add half a 
pint of good broth, and boil the onions til 
they are tender; strain the broth finom them, 
ana chop them vwy fine, and seesoB it

^nntea ; pour it into the dish, and lay over it 
H broiled rump steak. If instead of broth 

Em use good beef gravy, it will be super- 
tive. 

BEEP SAUSAGES. Take two beef 
flteafcs about the size of two hands, and the 
Sickness of a finger ; beat them well to make 
tbem flat, and pare the edges of thein ; then 
mince the perings with beef suet, parsley, 
green onions, mo^vooms, twi) shallots, and 1 
some basil kave.^, the whtile shred fine, and 
mixed into a forcemeat with the yolks of four 
eggs *, sipread this forcemeat on the slices of 
beef, adftd roll them up in the form of saussiges , 
tie them up with paekthread, and stew them 
with a little stock, a glass of wine, some salt, 
pepper, an onion stuck with two or three 
cloves, a carrot, and a parsnip ; wlien they 
are done, strain the liquor; and, having 
skimmed oflT the fot, reduce it over the fire 
to the consifltence of a sauce. Take care 
Aat the sauce ia not too higly flavored, and 
aerve it over your saosages ; or they may be 
' served with any ragout of vegetables you 
please. To serve the sausages cold, to make 
a dish for the second coarse, reduce the sauce 
by letting it boil with the sausages till almost 
aD the fat is consumed ; then let them stand 
to cool with what remains of the sauce ad- 
hering to theift, sCnd serve upon a napkin. 

BEEF, SHCmT OR SPICED. (To 
be eaten cdd.) Hang up ten or twelve 
pounds of the middle part of a brisket of 
beef for three or four dayit, then rub ^vell into 
U three ooooes of finely powdered saltpetre, 
and, if spice is approved of, one ounce of 
allspice, and half an ounce of black pepper; 
let It stand all night, then salt it with three 
pooodsof well-pmindedbay salt, and half a 
pound of treacle, in which let it remain ten 
days, robbing it daily. When it is to be 
boilal, sew it cloeely m a cloth, let the ^^ter 
only simmer, upon no account allowing it to 
boti, for nine hmirs over a slow fire, or upon a 
stove. When taken out of tlie water, place 
two sticks across the pot, and let the beef stand 
ovar the steam icNr half an hour, turning it 
finom side to side, then press it with a h^vy 
weight. It must not be taken out of the 
cloth till perfectly cold. 

BEE^ SOUP. (See Soup.) 

BEEF, SPRING GARDEN. Cut a 
piece of lean beef into thin slices like Seotth 
caUops, lard it thick with bacon, and put it 
into a pan with salt, pepper^ mace, two or 
three bay leaves, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; 
bake it ; tlien clear out all the gravy, and fill 
it im with clarified butter. 

2* 



BEEP TO SALT POR IMMEDUlt 
USE. Salt a round of beef moderately vf- 
on the tops and sides, put it upon sticks, at 
die tonga of a cheese-tub, over a tub of cold 
water, and the salt will be drawn through it, 
so that it will be fit for boiling next day. 

ANOTHER METHOD IS— To rub 
for half an honr into any piece of beef a good 
quantity of salt, and let it lie for thiee or 
hiu- days without touching it, when it may 
be used. ' 

BEEF SIRLOIN. The noble sirloin of 
about fifteen pounds (if much thicker, the out- 
side will l)e done too much before the iaside 
is enough), will require to be before the fire 
about tliree and a half or four hours ; take 
care to spit it evenly, that it may not be 
heavier on one side than the other ; put a little 
clean dripping into the drippingpan, (tie a 
shetit of paper over it to preserve t!ic fat), 
baste it well as soon as it is put down, and 
every quarter of an hour all the time it is 
roasting, till the last half hour ; tlien take 
ofi* the paper, and make some gravy for ft ; 
stir the fire and make it clear: to lirowa and 
fix>th it, sprinkle a little salt over it, baste it 
with butter, and dredge it with flom*; let it 
go a few minutes longer, till the froth rises, 
take it up, put it on tlie dish, &c. Garnish it 
witli hillocks of horse-radish, scraped as fine 
as possible with a very sharp knife. A York- 
shire pudding is an excellent accompaniment. 

BEEF SHIN STEWED. Desire the 

butcher to saw the bone into three or four 
pieces, put it into a stewpan, and Just cover 
it with cold water; when it simmers, skim 
it clean ; then put in a bundle of sweet herbs, 
a large onion, a head of celery, a do7«n ber- 
ries of black pepper, and the same.of allspice: 
stew very gently over a slow fire till the meat 
is tender; tins will take from about three 
hours and a half, to four and a half. Take three 
carrots, ped and Cut them into small squares j 
peel and cut ready in small squares a couple 
of tn^ips, with a couple of dozen of small 
yotmg round silver button onions ; boil them, 
till tender; the turnips and onions will be 
enough in about fifteen minutes ; the carrots 
will iTequrre abotit twice as long: drain them 
dry. When tlie beef is quite tender, lake it 
out carefolly with a slice, and put it on a dish 
while you thicken a pint and a half of the gra- 
vy: to do this, mix three table-epoonfiils d 
fiour with a tea-cupful of tlie beef liquor ; stir 
this dioroughly together till it boils, skim off 
the fat, strain it through a sieve, and put your 
vegetables in to warm; season with pepper, 
sak, and a wine-glass of mushroom catchup, 
or Port wine, or both, and pom' it over me .

txons are ten gallons of water, three quarts 
of molasses, a tea-cupful of ginger, the same 
of allspice, three ounces of hops, three 
ounces and a half of the essence of spruce, 
and half a pint of good yeast. Ilie hope, 
gingei', and allspice, must be boiled togetli- 
er till the hops fall to the bottom ; the molas- 
ses and spruce are then to be dissolved in a 
bucket-full of the liquor, die whole' strain- 
ed into a cask, and the yeast well stirred in ; 
when the fermentation ceases, the cask is 
to be bunged up. 

B^CB, BALM. Eleven gallons of 
water and ten pounds of brown sugar are 
to be clariSed with the whites of twelve 
eggs, ^air^ully skimmed and boiled till 
nearly reduced to ten gallons ; two pounds 
and a half of tfie yellow flower of lemon 
baJm being put into a cask, the liquor, 
when milk-warro, is to be poured over it, 
and fovr or five table-spoonfuls of Uiick 
yeast added* The cask must be filled up 
fnoming and evening with what works over 
it« and bunged up when the fermentation 
ceases. In a mondi the beer may ba bottled, 
and in two or three mondis it will be fit for 
drinking. Half the quantity of the flower 
of lemon balm will probacy be (bund to 
common icate a flavor sufficiently strong, if 
added when the fermentation is nearly over. 

BEER, GINGER. For a ten-gaUon 
cask, eleven galbns of water, fouiteen 
pounds of ,si^gar, the juice of eighteen lem- 
ons^ and one pound of ginger are allowed ; 
the sugar and water are boiled with the 
whites of eight eggs, and well skimmed ; 
jost before coming to tlic boiling point, the 
ginger, which must be bruised, is then ad- 
ded, and boiled for twenty minutes ; when 
cold, the clear part is put into the cask, to- 
gether with the lemon-juice and two spoon- 
fids of yeast; when it has fermented fer 
three or four days, it is fined, bunged up, 
and in a fortnight bottled. It may be made 
without the fruit. 

BEER, GINGER, QUICKLY MADE. 
A gallon of boiling water is poured over 
tfarpe>quart«rB of a pound of loaf sugar, one 
oonoe and a quarter of ginger, and the peel

they are tilted ; let them be bottled. Be 
carnul to use clean and dried bottles i leave 
them unstopped for twelve hours, and then 
cork them as closely as possible with good 
and sound new corks ; put a bit of lump so- 
gar as big as a nutn^g into each bottle: 
the beer will be ripe, t. t. fine and qnrk- 
ling, in about four or five weeks: if the 
weather is cold, to put it up the day before 
it is drunk, place it in a room where there 
is a fire. Remember there is a sediment* 
&c. at the bottom of the bottles, which yoa 
must carefully avoid disturbing ; so pour it 
off at once, leaving a wine-^assful at the 
bottom. 

*«* If beer becomes hard or stale, a few 
grains of carbonate of potash added to it 
at the time it is drunk will correct it, and 
make draught beer as brisk as bottled ale.

large saucepan of clean water on the fire ; 
wtien it boils take off the butter at tlie top, 
then take the fowls out one by one, throw 
tliem into that saucepan of water half a 
minute, whip it out, and dry it in a cloth 
inside and out ; continue till they ^are^ aQ 
done, scald the pot clean; when tlie birds 
are quite cold, season them with mace, 
pepper and salt, according to taste, put 
them down ck>6e in a pot, and pour clari- 
fied butt^ over them.

BRAISING PAN. A deep welUinned 
copper vessel, with two ears, the lid of which 
must close hermetically, and have a ledge 
round so that coals or hot ashes maybe 
placed on the top when necessary. 

BRAISING. Tliis is a method of 
dressing meat, poulti;y, &c. &c. without its 
undergoing any evaporation. It is done by 
lining a braising-pan with thin slices of bacon, 
beef, or veal, upon which place whatever 
you may intend to brtdeet and also add 
carrots, onions, lemons, bay leaf, herbs, 
pepper and salt. 

BRAWN, A COLLAR OF. Wash, 
■crape, and clean very thoroughly a large pig's 
head, feet, and ears; lay them into salt and 
water, with a little saltpetre, for three hours. 
To make the collar lai'ger, boil two ox heels, 
with the head, feet, and ears, till all the 
bones can be taken out easily, then put the 
bead round tiie mould, ai^ tlie feet and small 
pieces into the middle ; put it together while 
not, and press it with a heavy weight till it 
becomes cold. Boil for half an hour, in as 
much of the liquor as will cover the brawn, 
one hsmdful of salt, one ounce of pepper, 
and one or two bay leaves. When cold, 
pour it over the brawn. 

BRAWN, MOCK. Take die blade bone 
out of the shoulder, and boil it gently two 
hours or more, according to the age of the 
boar. When it is cold, season it very hi^ 
ly with pe^^MT, Cayenne, salt, a very little 
lulspice, mmced onion, and thyme. Let it 
lie a night in this seasoning-; the following 
day, make a savoury forcemeat of pounded 
▼eal, ham, beef suet, minced parsley, thyme, 
and an onion, a little lemon^ieel, salt,' nut- 
meg, pq>per, and Cayenne; bind it with an 
eg^ beaten, and stuff where the bone has 
been taken out. Put it into a deep pan with 
the brown side downwards, and lay under it 
twigs or small sticks, to keep it from ftick- 



ii^toiliebottMB; pew innboldeor

take it out and clear off all the &t, add a 
bottle of Madeira and the juice of a lu|p 
lemon, return it to the oven, and bake it til 
it become as tender as a jelW, so that a, 
straw will pierce it easily. If the boar ii 
an old one, it will require to be baked six or 
seven hours. This dish is eaten hot. 



BRAWN, TO BAKE. Take raw 
brawn, and the same quantity of ftit bacon, 
mince them small, tbesn pound them in a 
stone mortar, with a handful of sage, season-

make a hole in the centre, in which put two 
ounces of yeast; make your doug^ with warm 
water, to about the consistence of brioches 
woik it up welt, adding two ounces of sah, 
dissolved in a little warm water; cover, and 
set it in a warm place to rise; on this part 
of the operation depends the quality of^ths 
bread. Having left the dough one or two 
hours, (according to the season), knead it 
again, ajid leave it as before, for two ho«in. 
In the meanwhile, heat the oven, divide the 
dough into eight equal parts, of which form 
as many loaves, into any shape you please; 
put them into the oven as quidily as possible. 
As soon as they are done, rub the crusts with 
a little butter, which will give it a fine yellow 
color. 

BREAD, FRENCH, OR ROLLS. 

Take half a bushel or six pounds of sifted 
flour, knead it into dough, with two quarts 
of milk, three-quarters of a pound of warm 
butter, half a pound of yeast, and two ounces 
of salt ; when die whole is well worked vp, 
cover, and leave it to rise. In two hocn 
time, form it into rolls, and lay them on 
tinned plates. Place them in a slow oven. 
When they have been in an hour, put them 
into a very hot oven for twen^ minutes. 
Rasp them as soon^ they are baked. 

BREAD FRITTERS. BoU half a pint

sugar, and pass the salamander over them. 

BREAD, LONDON. To make London 
bread, put a bushel of good flour which has

yeast; put it into the flour, and stir it well 
with your bainds ; let it remain until it rises 
as high as it will go, which wiH take aboot

&11; then make up the dough with eiglit 
(Jjdarts more of warm water and one pound 
of salt ; work it well with your handi*, and 
then cover it over widi a sack or otlier coarse 
doth. Put the fire into the oven; Iieat it 
thoroughly) £Lud by the time it in hot, the 
dough wiU be ready. Next make die dougli 
into loaves, not exceeding four or five pounds 
each, sweep out the oven clean, and put in 
the loaves. Slmt the oven close, and they 
will be baked in about two hours and a half; 
then o()en tlie oven, and draw the bread. In 
munmcr the water need not be more than 
blood warm, but in winter it must be a few 
degrees higher in heat. During a hard 
frost, however, the water should be as hot as 
the hand could bear it, though not sufficiently 
hot to scald the yeast, as that would spoil 
the whole batch of bread. Odier quantities 
of bread are made in the same proportion. 

BREAD, PLAIN.SHORT. The same 
proportions of flour and butter must be used 
as in the receipt for short bread ; this must 
be mixed top^ether, rolled out, but not made 
quite so thick as in the rich kind ; but in die 
same form, pricked with a fork, and pinch- 
ed all round. A little sugar may be added. 

, BREAD, RICE. Take a pound of rice, 
and let it simmer in two quarts of water till 
it is quite tender; when it is of a proper 
warmtli mix it Uioroughly with four pounds 
of flour, adding yeast and salt, tlie same as 
for otlier bread; the proper quantity of yeast 
to be used» is about foiu* spoonfuls ; kn^ui it 
well ; then set it to rise before the fii'e. A 
portion of the flour should be reserved to 
make up the loaves. If the rice should re- 
quire more water, it must be added, as some 

rice swells more than odier.

BREAD, SPICED, COMMON. (1) 
Boil tliree pounds of honey in a gallon of 
water for a quarter of an hour ; dien pour it 
on the flour in die trough ; mix them togedier 
well, until the flour will imbibe no more li- 
quid ; when a little cooled, add three ounces 
of pota^, infused die night before in half a 
pint of milk, knead the whole well, putting 
to it some pounded anise. Roll out the 
paste, and with paste-cutters of various forms, 
oat it into Utde figures, lay them on a well- 
oiled tin, and bake thcan; when done, wash 
them over with milk. With this paste 
spiced nuts are made ; when formed, lay them 
on tins, and leave in a warm place for two 
or three days before they are baked. 

BREAD, SPICED, (2) FLEMISH. 
The evening- before you wish to make 
your spiced bread, dissolve three ounces of 
^ite potash in half a pint of milk, and set 
it aside. The next morning pot a consider- 



able quantity of sifted flour into a trough 
make a hole in the heap, into which pour at ' 
pounds of clarified honey ; whilst boiling, stir 
it wejl with a strong spatula, until die honey; 
reduced to a firm paste, wMl imbibe no more 
flour, then spread it all over the bottom of 
die ti'ough, and' leave it for about ten or fif 
teen minutes; at the end of that time, if the 
paste be sufficiently cool for you tbbear yoaf 
hand on it, rub its surface with the infieion 
of potash ; dien let a strong person koead it, 
in the same manner as the bakers knead 
bread. Have ready a number of difTereDt- 
sized moulds of pear tree wood, on whidi 
ai-e cut (pretty deep) octagons of various di- 
mensions ; dicn cut your paste into as many 
pieces as you have mouldis, in die followii^ 
proportions; — for die mould containing a 
pound, take eighteen ounces of paste ; for a 
half pound, fourteen ounces; a quarter oS 
a pound seven ounces of paste, and so on; 
knead each piece separately on the slab, rub 
them widi flour to prevent their adhering, and 
then put them into die respective moulds; 
press it down tight ; in a minute or two torn 
them over, place diera on a tin plate (pre- 
viously rubbed widi olive oil), and with a 
soft brush take oflT wliat flour may remain 
on the sm-face of the spiced bread, and bake 
them in a moderate oven. Whilst di^ are 
baking, dissolve some isinglass in a sufficient 
quantity of beer, widi which, by means of 
a hair pencil, wash the outside of the spiced 
bread as soon as it is done ; and dien, nbilo 
it is moist and warm, decorate it widi 
blanciied almonds, candied lemon and orange 
peel, cut into dice. You may, if you think 
proper, cut diese sort of sweet meats into 
very small pieces, and knead them into yow 
paste at first. When they are nearly cold, 
separate the pieces with a Knife. 

BREAD, SHORT. For two poundsof 
sifled flour allow one pouiul of butter, salt or 
fi"esh ; a quarter of a oound of candied orange 
and lemon peel, of^ pounded loaf sugar, 
blanched sweet almonds, and carraway cm- 
fits, a quarter of a pound each ; cut the kb)- 
on, the oranee peel, and ahnonds into sa»Ji 
thin bits, and mix them widi a pound and a j

BROCCX)LI. Set a pan of clean cold 
crater on the table, and a saucepan <mi the 
Are with {denty of water, and a handful of 
flah in it. Broccoli is prepared by stripping 
off all the side shoots, leaving the top; peel 
off the skin of the stalk with a knife; cut it 
cloae off at the bottom, and put it into the 
pan of cold water. When the water in the 
Btewpan boils, and the broccoli is ready, 
pat It in; let it boil briskly till the stalks 
feel tender, firom ten to twenty minutes ; take 
it up wifli a slice, that you may not break it; 
let it drain, and serve up. If some of the 
heads cS broccoli are much bigger than the 
others, put than on to boil first, so that they 
jsay get all dooe together. Ofr*.'— It makes 



a nice supper-dish served opon a toast, likn 
asparagus. It is a very delicate v^etable» 
and you must take it up the moment it k 
done, and send it to table hot. 

BROTH, BARLEY. Chop a leg of 
beef in pieces, boil it in three gallons of 
water, with a carrot and a crust of bread, 
tin reduced to half; then strain it off and 
put it into the pot again with half a pound 
of barley, four or five heads of celery cot 
small, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, a 
little cliopped parsley, and a few marigolds. 
Let it boil an hour. Take an old cock or 
laige fowl and put it into the pot, boil tiQ 
the broth is quite good. Season with sah, 
take out the onion and herbs, and serve it* 
The fowl may be omitted. 

BROTH, OF BEEF. Wash a leg or 
shin of beef very clean, crack the bone in 
two or three places, add to it any trim- 
mings you have of meat, game, or poultry 
(heads, necks, gizzards or feet) ana cover 
them with cold water. Watch and stir it 
up well from the bottom, and the moment it 
begins to simmer, skim it car^lly. Your 
brotli must be perfectly clear and limpid— 
for on this depends the goodness of the 
soups, sauces, and s^ravies, of which it is 
the basis. Then add some cdd water to 
make the remaining scum rise, and skim 
it again. When the scum has done rising, 
and the surface of the broth is quite clear« 
put in one carrot, a head of celery, two 
turnips, and two onions. It should not 
have any taste of sweet herbs, q)ice or gar- 
lic; either of these flavors may be added 
afterward, if desired. Cover it close, set it 
by the side of the fire, and let it simmer 
very gently, so as not to waste the broth, 
for four or five hours or more, according to 
the weight of the meat. Strain it through 
a sieve into a clean and dry stone pan, and 
set it in the coldest place you have. 

ICF* This is the foundation of all sorti 
of soups and sauces, Ixrown and white. 

BROTH, CHICKEN. Take the re- 
maining psuts of a chicken firom which 
panada has been made, all but the rump; 
skin, and put them into the water it waa 
first boiled in, with the addition of a little 
mace, onion, and a few pepper-corns, and 
simmer it. When of a good flavor, pot to 
it a quarter of an ounce of sweet almmidi 
beaten with a spoonful of water; boil it 
a little while, ana when cokl, take off the

BROTH, MUTTON, FOR THE SICK. 
Have a pound and a half of a neck or loin 
of mutton; take off the skin and the fat, and

vrater, (it will take about a quart to a pound 
of meat), let it simmer very gently, and 
skim it well ; cover it up, and set it over a 
moderate fire, where it may stand gently 
stewing for about an hour; then strdin it on. 
It should be allowed to become cold, when 
an the greasy particles will float on the sur- 
fiu%, and becoming 'hard, can be easily 
taken off, and the settlings will remain at 
the bottom. N. B. — ^We direct the meat to 
be done no more than just sufiiciently to be 
eaten ; so a sick man may have plenty of 
good broth for nothing; as by this manner 
of producing it, the meat fiirnishes also a 
good fiunily meal. This is an inoffensive 
nourishmeitf for sick persons, and the only 
mutton broth that should be given to conva- 
lescents, whose constitutions require raplen- 
ishing with restorative aliment of easy di- 
gestion. The common way of making it 
with roots, onions, sweet herbs, &c. &c. is 
too strong for weak stomachs. Plain broth 
will agree with a delicate stomach, when 
the least addition of other ingredients would 
immediately offend it.

thickenings keep for sometime. 

BROWNING, Is a convenient article 
to color those soups or sauces of which it is 
supposed dieir deep brown complexion de- 
notes the strength and savouriness of the 
composition. Burned sugar is also a &• 
vorite ingredient with the brewers, who use 
it under the name of " essentia hina" to col- 
or their beer : it is also employed by tlie bran- 
dy makers, in considerable quantity, to color 
brandy ; to which, besides enriching its com- 
plexion, it gives that sweetish taste, and fiil- 
ness in the mouth, which custom has taught 
brandy drinkers to admire, and prefer to 
the finest Cognac in its genuine state. When 
employed for culinary purposes, this is some- 
times made with strong gravy, or wafaiHt 
catchup. Those who luce a i^tmi of acid

fine flour into a wooden bowl ; set a sponge 
of it with a gill of yeast and a pint of 
warm milk ; wen mix with it one pound of 
sifled sugar, one pound of oiled fivsh butter, 
coriander seeds, cmnamon, and mace, a small

Then rub the Ixitter with the flour, till well 
mixed together; add a little warm water, 
and a quarter of a pint of fi^esh good yeast, 
and work it into a lig^t smooth paste ; cut 
off nearly one-third of the paste, to form the 
sheet or case, and lay it aside ; with the rest 
work up the fiiiit, sweetmeats, and spices ; 
make it into a round form like a thick cheese. 
Roll out the sheet of paste, lay the bun in the 
centre, and gather it all round, closing it at 
the bottom, by wetting the edges of the paste, 
and cutting it so as to lie quite flat. Turn 
it up, and run a wire or small skewer through

BUTTER, CLARIFIED. Put the butter 
in a mce, clean stewpan, over a very clear, 
slow fire ] watch it, and wlien it is melted, 
carefully skim off tlie buttermilk, &c. which 
will swim on the top ; let it stand a minute 
(NT two for the impurities to sink to the bot- 
tom; then pour die clear butter through a 
sieve into a clean basin, leaving die sediment 
at die bottom of die stewpan. Obs. — But- 
ter thus purified will be as sweet as marrow, 
a ver^ useful covering for otted meats, &c. 
and tor frying fish equal to the fiunest Florence 
oil; for whidi purpose it is oommcmly used 
by Catholics, and those whose reliffious ten- 
ets will not 2dl9w them to eat viaiM^ firied in 
animal oil. 

BUTTER, FRENCH MELTED. Mix, 
in a stewpan, wiUi a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, a table-spoonful of flour, a little 
salt, half a gill of water, lialf a spoonful of 



while vmeear, aad a little mtod niitef^* 
Put it (Ml the fire, ttir it, and let it thicken, 
but do noiaUow it to boil, lest k should taste 
of the flour. 

BUTTER, MELTED. (1) Dintalktle 
flour ovor a quarter of a pound of bntfer, pot 
k into a saucepan, with about a win&^law 
of water ; stir it one way constantly till it be 
melted, and let it just boil: a round wooden 
stick, is die best thing to stir butter with In 
melting. If the butter is to be melted with 
cream, use the same proportion as of water, 
but no flour ; stir it constantly, and heat it 
thorou^ly, but do not let it boil. To ofl 
butter, cut about a quai'ter of a pound into 
slices, put it into a small jar, and place it in . 
a pan of boiling water. When oiled, pour 
it off clear from die sediment. 

BUTTER, MELTED, (2) Is so simple 
and easy to prepare, that it is a mattor of 
geneiTtl surprise, that what is done so ofteoy 
IS so seldom done right. It is spoiled nine 
times out of ten, more from idleness dian from 
igiiontnce, and rather because the cook won*t 
than because site can't do it; which can on- 
ly be die case when housekeqwrs will not 
allow butter to do it widi. Good melted 
butter cannot be made with maix) flour and 
water ; there iiAist be a full and proper pro- 
portion of butter. As it must be always on 
the table, and is the foundation of almost all 
our sauces, we have.

I have tried every way of making it; and I 
trust, that I have wntten a receipt, (3) 
which, if the cook .will cai-efiiliy olMsrre, 
she will constantly succeed in giving sutia- 
faction. In the quantities of the various 
sauces I have ordered, I have had in view 
the providing for a £imily of half a dozen 
moderate people. Never pour sauce over meat 
or even put it into die dish; however well 
made, some of the c<Mnpany may have en 
antipathy to it; tastes are as different ai 
faces : moreover, if it is sent up separate m a 
boat, it will keep hot longer, and what is left 
may be put by for another time, or used fcr 
another purpose. 

BUTTER, MELTED, (3) Keep a pint 
stewpan; for this purpose only. Gut two 
ounces of butter into little bits, that it mi^ 
melt more easily, and mix more readily; put 
it into the stewpan with a large teanspoon* 
ful (t. e. about three drachms) of flow, 
(some prefer arrow-root, or potato scardi)

much more easily and more intimately than 
water alone can be made to do. This is 
of proper thickness to he mixed at table 
with flavouring essences, anchovy, mush-

to it. N. B. — If die butter oils, put a

a spoon ; if it is very much oiled, it must 
be poured backwards and Ibrwards fram

CABBAGE AND CHEESE SOUP. 
See Soup. 

CABBAGE, TO STEW. Wash a cab- 
bage well, slice it as for pickling, and pot it 
into a stewpan, with half a tea-cupful of 
Port wine, and a bit of batter kneaded in 
flour, a little salt and pepper; stir it till the 
butter is melted ; cover the pan, and let it stew 
a little, but not to become too soft ; as it eats 
better radier crisp; add a table-spoonful of 
vinegar, give it one boil, and serve it hot. 
Tlie wine may be omitted. 

CABBAGE, TO PICKLE. Choose two 
middling-sized, well-colored, and firm red 
cabbages, shred them very finely, first pulling 
off the outside leaves ; mix witn them nearly 
half a pound of salt, tie it up in a thin cloth, 
and let it bang for twelve hours ; then put it 
into small jars, and pour over it cold vin^ar 



that has been boiled with a frw bMhomM In

the red cabbage. 

CAKES. PRBPAmATOKT mKMAmX0. 

Hie currants and raisins should be prepared 
as directed under the article headed, Pud- 
dings and Pics, and the flour dried befbrs 
the fire on a large slieet of white paper, then 
sifled and weiglied. Almonds should be 
blanched by pouring hot >valer ofver tliem, 
and, after standing some minutes, taking off 
the skin, then thi\>wing them into rose or 
cold water. When not pounded, they should 
be cut lengthwise into thin bits. Sugar 
should be roughly pounded, rolled with a 
bottle upon white pi^oiier, and dien siibd. All 
iqiices, after being well dried at the ire, should 
be finely pound^ and sifted. Lemon and 
orange-peel must be pared very thin, and 
pounded with a little sugar. The butter, 
afler being weighed, should be laid into cold 
water, or washed in rose wator, and if sak, 
be well washed in several waters. The 
yolks and whites of ^gs should be separatriy 
and long beaten, then strained; two whiake 
should be kept exclusively ibr that pur* 
pose, as the whites especially require to be 
mauaged with the greatest care. A horn 
spoon sliould be usecf for mixing those cakes 
which are not directed to be beaten with the 
hand. To make cakes light, salvolatile, or 
smelling salts, may be added immediately 
before putting theiu into the oven, allowing, 
to asponge csdbe, made of oae poimd of flotur, 
one tea-spo(Mifui ; and two or three to a large 
plum cake. Cheese cakes, qoeoi cakes, 
sponge biscuits, and smaU sponge cakes, r&* 
quire a quick oven till thfw have risen ; after* 
wards the heat should be more moderate. 
Plum, seed cakes, and all large kinds, must be 
well soaked, and tlierelbre do not i^uire a 
brisk oven. To preserve their color, a sheet of 
white paper is put over them, and after they 
have risen and become firm, they are turned 
round. To ascertain if a large cake be 
sufficiently done, a broad bbded knife is 
plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and 
clean when drawn out, the eake is baked; 
but if anything adheres to the lilade, it must 
instantly be returned to the oven, and the 
door closed. When the oven is too hot, it 
is better to lessen die fire than to open (he 
door. 

CAKE. Take two pounds and a half of 
dried and sifted flour, the same <^ well clean- 
ed and dried currants, two pounds of fiesh 
batter, two of finely-pounded and sifted loaf 
sngar, a nutmeg grated, a tea-spoonfiil of 
pounded cinnamon, one ounce of citron and

and bake it in a buttered tin, or in small 
tins ; do not more than half fill them.

stood to rise, bake them in a quick oven. 
Care should be taken nevo* to pot yoor 
yeast to water or milk too hot, or too cold, an 
either extreme will destroy the fermentation.

CAPONS OR FOWLS, Must be kill- 
ed a couple of davs in moderate, and more 
in coki weather, before they are dressed, ch* 
they will eat tougli: a good criterion of tbe 
ripeness of poultry for the spit, is the ease 
with which you can then pull out tlie feathers ; 
when a fowl is plucked, leave a few to help 
you to ascertain this. They ai'e managed 
exactly in the same manner, and sent up 
with iLe same sauces as a turkey, only they 
require proportionably less time at the fire. 
A fiill-grown flve-toed fowl, about an hour 
and a quarter. A moderate-sized one, an 
hour. A chicken, from thirty to'forty rain- 
utes. Here, also, pork sausages fried are 
in general a &vorite accompaniment, or 
torkey stuffing ; see forcemeats ; put in plen- 
ty of it, so as to plump out the fowl, which 



nHBt be tied ckiiely (both at the aeck aad 
rump), to keep in tne stuffing. Some cooks 
put the liver cmT the fowl into this fore euica t, 
and otliers mince it and pound it, and nib it 
up with flour and melted butter. When 
the bii'd is stufled and trmied, 'score the 
^inard nicelv, dip it into melted butter, let 
It drain, ana then season it with Cayenne 
and salt ; put it under one pinion, and the 
liver under the other; to prevent their get- 
ting hardened or scorched, cover them with 
double paper buttered. Take care that 
your roasted poultry be well browned ; it is 
as indispensable that roasted poultry riiould 
have a rich lNx>wn complexion, as boiled 
poultry should have a delicate white one. 

CAPOxN, TO CHOOSE. Ifitisyoun^, 
his spurs are short and his legs smooth ; if 
a true capon, a hi vein on the side of his 
breast, the cond> pale, and a thick belly and 
rump; if fi^esh, be will have a dose hard 
vent; if stale, a loose open vent. 

CAPON, THE FRENCH WAY. Take 
a quart of white wine, season die capon 
with salt, cloves, and whole pepper, a few 
shalfots ; and then put the capon m an earth- 
en pan ; you must take care it has not roum 
to shake; it must be covered close, and done 
over a slow charcoal fire. 

CAPON PASTY. Roast a capon, let 
it be cold, take the flesh firom the hemes and 
slice it, but keep the thighs and pinions 
whole. Add to the flesh of the capon, four 
sweetbreads and half a pint of oysters, sea- 
son them with salt, cloves, nutmeg, and 
mace, sweet marjoram, pennyroyal, and 
thyme, minced; ny a sheet of paper or 
paste in your pasty-pan, and lay tlie thighs 
and pinions on the bottom, and strew them 
over with sliced onions, then put in the 
flesh of the capon, tlie sweetbreads, and the 
oysters, cut in halves; over these strew a 
liandfiil of chestnuts, boiled and blandied, 
dien put butter over them, close up your pan 
and l^e it; when done, add gravv, good 
stock, drawn butter, anchovies, ana grafted 
nutmeg ; garnish with slices of lemon, and 
serve. Tiirkey may be done in the same 
manner.

knife, and take out all the seeds, but as lit- 
tle of die meat as possible; lay them in a 
strong brine for three days, changing it eve- 
ry day ; thep take diem out, lay them on a 
cloth, and lay another over them till they 
are quite dry ; boil vinegar enough to cover 
tliem, put in some mace and nutmeg beat 
small ; put the pods into a glass or jar, and 
when die liquor is cold, pour it over, then 
tie a bladder and leather over tiiem.

enough for young spring carf ots ; grown car- 
rots must be cut in half, and will take from 
an hour and a half to two hours and a half. 
When done, rub off the peels with a clean 
coarse clodi, and slice tbem in two or four, 
according to their size. The best way to 
try if they are done enough, is to pierce them 
with a fork. Many people are fond of cold 
carrot with cold beef; ask if you shall cook 
enough for some to be left to send up with 
the cold meat. 



CARAMEL, OR BOILED SUGAR. 

Break into a small copper or brass pan, one 
pound of refined sugar, — ^put in a gill of 
spring water ; — set it on a fire, and when 
it boils, skim it quite clean, and let it boil 
quick, till it comes to the degree called 
Crack, which may be known by dipping a 
teaspoon or skewer into the sugar, and let 
it drop to the bottom of a pan of cold water; 
and if it remains hard, it has attained that 
degree; squeeze in the juice of half a leinon, 
and let it remain one minute longer on the 
fire, then set die pan into another of cold 
water: — ^have ready moulds of any i^pe, 
— ^rab them over with sweet oil, dip a spoon 
or fork into the sugar, and throw it over the 
mould in fine direads, till it is quite covered: 
— make a small handle of caramel, or stick 
on two or three small gum paste rings, by 
way of ornament, and place it over smau 
pastry of any description.

brace of carp, reserving the liver and roe; 
take half a pint of vinegar, or a quart of 
sharp cider, add as much water as will cov- 
er the fish, a piece of horse-radish, an onion 
cut into slices, a little salt, and a faggot of 
sweet herbs ; boil the fish in this liquor, and

the liquor die fish has been boiled in, and 
put to it the liver minced, a pint of Port 
wine, two anchovies, two or three heads of 
shallots chop})ed, some salt and black pep- 
per, a litde Cayenne, a tablenspoonfid of soy;

the flavor is {»«ferred, with a little mace, 
three cloves, some salt and Jamaica pepper, 
two onions sliced, a fa^ot of parsley, basil, 
diyme, and marjomm; let them soak an 
hour, then put them in a stewpan with the 
vin^ar, and other things, die liver chopped, 
a pint of Madeira, and three pints of veal 
stock; stew them sm hour or two accord- 
ing to their size; take out the fish and pot

hot, firy to a rich odor, and nerve it with 
lemon-juice. 

CARROT FRITTERS. Beat two or 
diree boiled carrots to a pulp with a spoon ; 
add to them six ^gs and a handful of flour ; 
moisten them widi either cream, milk, or 
white wine, and sweeten them. Beat all

and cream ; sweeten, and stir it again over 
the fire for three or four minutes; pour it in- 
to a mould ; turn it out when cold. 

CAULIFLOWER. Choose tliose that 
are close and white, and of the middle size ; 
trim off the outside leaves ; cut the stalk off 
flat at the bottom ; let them lie in sak and 
water an hour before you boil them. Put 
them into boiling water with a handful of 
salt in it; skim it well, and let it boil slow- 
)y till done, which a small one will be in fif- 
teen, a large one in about twenty minutes ; 
take it up the moment it is enough, a min- 
ute or two longer boiling will spoil it. 

CAULIFLOWERS OR BROCCOLI, 
PICKLED. Choose those that are hard, 
yet sufficiently ripe, cut away the leaves and 
stalks. Set on a stewpan half full of water, 
salted in proportion of a quarter of a pound 
of salt to a quart of water ; throw in the 
cauliflower, and let it heat gradually; when 
it boils take it up with a spoon full of holes, 
and spread them on a cloth to dry before 
the fire, for twenty-four hours at least ; when 
quite dry, put them, piece by piece, into 
jars or glass tie-overs, and cover than with 
the pickle we have directed for beet roots, 
or make a pickle by infiising three ounces 
of the curry powder for three days in a quart 
of vinegar by the side of the fire. Nastur- 
tioms are exoellait prepared as above. 

CAULIFLOWERS, PICKLED. C^^t 
the cauliflowers in pieces, and throw them 
into boiling water far a quarter of an hour; 
flien lay Hxm on cloths to drain. Put them

ftnd bitfl of botter between. In the mean- 
time, soak 80 many thin slices of bread as 
will cover the whole, in warm milk; over 
which place a plate, and a weiglit, to ke^ 
the bread close upon the aimles; let it bake 
slowly for three hours. For a middling- 
sized dish, you should use half a pound of 
butter for the whole. 

CHARLOTTE. (2) This second course 
may be made of any kind of fruit you please, 
and is eaten hot. If apples are used, pare, 
core, and cut about twenty of them into 
small pieces, and put them into a stewpan 
with some water, a good piece of firesh but^ 
ter, powderHsugar, pounded cinnamon, and 
grated lemon-peel, and stew till the water is 
dried up ; then set them to cool in an earth- 
en ware vessel. Cut some very thin slices 
of crumb of bread, dip them in melted fresh 
butter, and lay them neatly all over the bot- 
tom and round the sides of the stewpan; 
then pour in the apples, leaving a hole in 
the middle, in which put apricot marma- 
lade. Cover the whole with bread, sKced 
thin, and buttered as above. Place it in a 
hot oven, bake it sui hour, and turn it out. 

CHARLOTTE DES POMMES. Pare, 
core, and mince fourteen or fifteen French 
rennet apples; put them into a firying-pan, 
with some pqunded loaf sugar, a little pound- 
ed cinnamon, grated lemon-peel, and two 
ounces and a half of fi-esh butter ; fry them 
a quarter of an hour over a quick fire, stir- 
ring them constantly. Butter a shape of 
the size the charlotte is intended to be; cut 
strips of bread about the width of two fin- 
sers, and long enough to reach from the 
bottom to the rim of the shape, so that the 
whole be lined with bread; dip each bit in- 
to melted butter-, and then put a layer of 
the fried apples, and one of apricot jam or 
marmalade, and then one of bread dipped 
into butter; begin and finish with it. Bake 
it in an oven for nearly an hour; turn it out 
to serve it. It may be boiled, and served 
with a sweet sauce. 

CHEESE, BOILED. Grate a quarter 
of a pound of good cheese, put it into a 
«auce pan, with a bit of butter the size of a 
nutmeg, and half a tea-cupfiil of milk, stir it 
over the fire till it boil, and then add a well- 
beaton eag; mix it all tc^ether, put it into 
a small ifish, and brown it before the fire. 

CHEESE, CAKE OF. Take about the 
fiwrth part of a close, hi Brie cheese, pound 
and rub it through a sieve ; mix with it a 
|Hiit and a half c? flour ; lay it on the boaixl, 
make a hole in the middle, into which put 
three quarters of a pound of butter, and work 
it Ja well; add to it a little Gn^ere cheese 



grated, and six eggs. Knead these all to* 
gether well; mould it up, and let it stand 
for half an hour ; then roll it out, and make 
it into a cake of about three inches; mark 
it with a knife on one side in chequers, and 
on the other in rays; dfr'ez, and bake it ia 
a moderate oven. 

CHEESE CREAM. Warm three half 
pints of cream with one half pint of milk, 
or according to the same proportion, and 
put a little rennet to it; keep it covered in 
a warm place till it is curdled ; have a pro- 
per mould with holes, either of China or any 
other; put the curds into it to drain, about 
an hour, or less: serve with a good plaia 
cream, and pounded sugar over it. 

CHEESECAKES. (1) Put two quarts 
of new milk into a stewpan, set it near the 
fire, and stir in two tal^spoiHifiik of ro^ 
net: let it stand till it is set (this will take 
about an hour); break it well with yoor 
hand, and let it remain half an hour longer; 
then pour ofi'the whey, and put the curd into 
a colander to drain; when quite dry, put it 
in a mortar, and pound it quite smooth; 
then add four ounces of sugar, pounded and 
sifted, and three ounces of fi^sh butter ; oil 
it first by putting it in a little potting-pot, 
and setting it near the fire ; stir it all well 
together: mat the yolks of four eggs in a 
basin, with a little nutmeg grated, lemon- 
peel, and a glass of brandy ; add this to the 
curd, with two ounces of currants, washed 
and picked; stir it all well together; have 
your tins ready lined with pufi* paste about 
a quarter of an inch thick, notch them all 
round the edge, and fill each with the curd. 
Bake them twenty minutes. When yoo 
have company, and want a variety, you can 
make a mould of curd and cream, by put- 
ting the curd in a taiould full of hol^, instead 
of the colander: let it stand for six hours, 
then turn it out very carefiiily on a dish, and 
pour over it half a pint of good cream sweet- 
ened with loaf sugar, and a little nutmqr. 
What there is left, if set in a cool place, 
will make excellent cheesecakes the next 
day. 

CHEESECAKES. (2) Put a spooofiil 
of rennet into a quart of milk ; when Uuned, 
drain the curd thorough a coarse sieve, gent- 
ly break the curd, and rub in a quarter of 
a pound of butter, a quarter ai a peimd of 
sugar, nutmeg, and two Naples biscuits 
grated, the yolks of four eggs, and the white 
of one, half an ounce of almonds, half bitter 
and half sweet, well beaten in a mortar, 
with two spoonfiils of rose water, four oonoes 
of currants; put in the curd, and mix all 
together. One quart oi milk, and three 
deasert spoonfiils of rioe-flour, six eggs, ieavo

CHEESECAKES. (3) Beat 'eight 
tggs well, while a quart c^ milk u on the 
fire, and when it boib, put in the eggs, and 
stir them till they come to a curd ; then pour 
it out, and whe«i it is cold, pot in a little 
Bah, two spooniuLB of rose water, and thi-ee- 
quartons of a pound of currantj well washed ; 
pot it into pufT paste, and bake it. If yoa 
nee tin patties to bake in, butter tliera, or 
^roa will not be able to take them out ; but 
if you bake tliem in glass or china, only an 
■l^ier crust will be necessary, as you will 
not want to take thorn out when you send 
diem to table. 

CHEESECAKES. (4) Take one pound 
of loaf siffiar pounded, six yolks, and four 
whites ofeggs beaten, die juice of three fine 
lemons, the grated rind of two, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of fresh butter ; put these in- 
gredients into a saucepan, and stir die mix- 
ture gently over a slow fire till it be of the 
opneistence of honey; \yoar it into small 
jars, and when cold put paper dipped in 
brandy over tliem. It will keep good (or a 
year. 

CHEESE, POUNDED. Cut a pound 
of good mellow cheese into thin bits; add 
to it two, and if the clieese is dry, three 
ounces of fresh butter ; pound, and rub them 
well together in a mortar till it is quite 
smooth. When cheese is dry, and for those 
whoee digestion is feeble, this is the best 
way <^ eating it ; and spread on bread, it 
makes an excellmt luncheon or supper. 
The piquanee of diis is sometimes increas- 
ed by pounding with it curry powder, ground 
flpice, black pepper, Cayenne, and a little 
made mustard; and some moisten it with a 
glass of Sherry. If pressed down hard in 
a jar, and covered with clarified butter, 
it will keep f<Nr several days in cool weath- 
er. 

CHEESE, ROASTED. Grate three 
ounces of fiit cheese, mix it with the 
Tolks of two ^gs, four ounces of grated 
bread, and three ounces of butter ; b^t the 
whole well in a mortar, with a dessert spoon- 
fol of mustard, and a little salt and pepper. 
Toast some Imad, cut it into proper pieces ; 
lay the paste, as above, diick upon them, 
put them into a Dutch oven covered with a 
dish, tin hot through, remove die didi, and 
1^ the cheedb brown a little. Serve as hot 
as possible. 

CHEESE, STE^VED. Melt du-ee- 
onarters of an ounce of butter in a tea-cup- 
nlof cream, mix with it a quarter of a 



poond of good cheese finely jgpled, beat it 
well together; put a slice « toosted bread 
into a dish, and pour the mixture over it, 
and brown it with a salamander. 

CHEESE TOASTED, OR RABBIT. 

Cut a slice of bread, toast it, and soak it 
in red wine, put it before the fire ; cut some 
cheese in very thin slices, and rub some but- 
ter over die bottom of a plate, lay the cheese 
upon it, and fmur in two at three spoonfiils 
of white wine, and a little mustara; cover 
it with another plate, and set it on a chafing- 
dish of coals two or tliree minutes, then stir 
it till it is well mixed ; wlien it is mixed 
enougli, lay it upon the bread, and brown it 
widi a salamander. 

CHEESE TOASTED. Cut a slice of 
bread about half an inch thick ; pare off the 
crust, and toast it very slightly on one side 
so as just to brown it, without making it 
liard or burning it. Cut a slice of ^tod 
fat mellow dieese, a quarter of an indi 
diick, not so big as the bread by half an 
inch on eacli side: pare off the rind, cut out 
all tlie specks and rotteu parts, and lay it 
on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; 
carefully watch it that it does not burn, and 
stir it with a spoon to prevent a pellicle 
forming on the surface. Have ready good 
mustand, pepper and salt. If you observe 
the directions here given, die cheese will 
eat mellow, and will be uniformly done, 
and the bread crisp and soft, and will well 
desaTe its ancient appellation of a ** rare 
bit." This Receipt, as well as every other 
worth extracting, is fiwn the Cook's Oracle. 
Tlie Editor goes on to say. We have noth- 
ing to add to the directions given for toast- 
ing the cheese in die last receipt, except that 
in sending it up, it will save much time in 
portioning it oat at table, if you have half a 
dozen small silver or tm pans to fit into the 
cheese-toaster, and do the cheese in these: 
each person may then be helped to a sepa- 
rate pan, and it will keep the cheese much 
hott^ than the usual way of eating it on a 
cold plate. Ob». — Ceremony seldom tri- 
umplis more completely over comfprt than in 
the serving out of this dish ; which, to be 
presented to the palate in perfectioir, it is 
imperatively indispensable that it be intro- 
duced to the mouth as soon as it appears on 
the table. 

CHERRY BRANDY. (1) Pick and 
iMtiise eight pounds of black maroons, and the 
same Quantity of small black cherries ; let them 
stand for two months in a cask with six 
gallons of brandy, two pounds of crushed 
sugar, and a quart of sack well stirred to- 
gether. At the end of that time it may be 
dravyn off and botded.

CHERRY BRANDY. (2) aiooec 
fine sound morella chenies, and having 
taken ofT the stalks, place diem in layera 
in glass jars; strew powder-sugar between 
each layer, and cover them with brandy. 
Ab soon aa the cherries have imbibed tlie 
brandy, pour in more, so as to keep them 
constantly covered. 

CHERRIES, DRIED. Take large 
cherries, not too ripe ; pick ofT the stalks, 
and take out the stones with a quill cut 
Dearly as for a pen: to three pounds of which 
take three pounds or pints of clarified sugar ; 
boil it to the degree of blown ; put in the 
cherriesi give them a boil, and set them by 
in an eanhen pan till tiie next day; then 
strain the sirup, add more sugar, and boil 
it of a good consistence ; put tiie cherries in, 
and boil them five minutes, and set tliem by 
anotiier day: repeat the boiling two more 
days, and wlien wanted, drain them some- 
time, and lay them on wire sieves to dry in 
a stove, or neaily cold oven. 

CHERRY PUDDING. See Puddings. 

CHERVIL, Is principally used in soups 
and stuffing, and is generally preserved with 
other herbs as follows: take of sorrel, chen'il, 
beet, purslain, and cucumbers, if in season, 
quantities according to your liking; wash 
them well; mince and press them in your 
hand, to squeeze out all die wrater. Put 
them into a kettle widi water, some butter 
and salt, and boil them until the water is 
entirely consumed. Then take diem out, 
and when cold, put diem into pots; cover 
them with warmed butter. When you 
want to use these herbs, put diem into some 
stock that has very litde salt in it. If they 
are required for a farce or garnish, boil them 
a minute or two in some l^utter; thicken 
with the yolks of eggs and milk ; when so 
prepared, they may be served under hard 
eggs or broiled fish. For sauce, it must be 
chopped small, boiled in salt and water, and 
mixed with melted butter. 

CHESTNUTS, Should be placed on die 
fire in a pan with holes to roast ; first slitting 
or cutting a notch in die skins, to prevent 
their flying off. Wlien done, serve them in 
dessert on a napkin, as hot as possible 
Some boil the chestnuts instead of i^)asting 
them, as die skins are dien cleaner, but the 
Buts not quite so mealy; die better way 
is to boil them in plenty of water, and 
-whea nearly done, take them out and roast 
Ihem. 

CHICKENS. Having picked die chick- 
ens, singe them well to remove all the hairs, 
&c., which may remain on the skin; then 



bruise the bone close to the feot, and dra|r 
the strings from die diigh. Take out thfi 
crq? by a slit cut in the back of the neck; 
then cut off the neck, leaving skin enough to 
turn over die back. Cut off the vent, and 
take out die inside, being careful not to break 
the gall ; break the back-bone and the two 
bones leading to the pinions ; wipe the chick- 
en widi a clod), and put in a litde pepper 
and salt. If die chicken is to be trussed for 
roasting, proceed as follows: — Tm-n the legs 
close down to the apron and run a skewer 
through ; run another skewer in die joint of 
one wing dirough the body to the other wing; 
and having waslied the liver and gizzard, 
place them in die pinions. For boiling, the 
under part of die thigh must be cut, ai^ the 
legs placed under the apron, only letting the 
ends be seen. Be sure to preserve the breast 
very full. 

CHICKEN BROTH. See Broth. 

CHICKENS, BROILED OR GRILL- 
ED. Pick and singe them nicely, wash 
them clean, and dry them in a cloth ; cut them 
down die back, truss the legs and wings, as 
for boiling ; flatten them, and put them upon 
a cold gi'idiron ; when tli^ become a littfe 
dry, put them upon a plate, baste them with 
butter, and strew a litde salt and pepper 
over the inside, which part is laid first upon 
the gridiron ; baste them frequently, and let 
them broil slowly for about half an hour* 
Serve diem vei'y hot, with melted butter 
poured over them, or plenty of stewed miKh- 
rooms. The livers and gizzards may be 
broiled with them, fastened into die wingg, 
or well seasoned, broiled, and served with 
the chickens. 

CinCKEN BAKED IN RICE. Cut 

a chicken into joints as for a fi*icafisee, sea- 
son it well widi pepper and salt, lay it into a 
pudding dish lined widi slices of ham or ba- 
con, add a pint of veal gravy, and an onioB

CHOPS OR STEAKS. Those who 
are nice about steaks, never attempt to have 
them, except in weather which permits the 
meat to be hung till it is tender, and give the 
butcher some days' notice of their wish for 
them. If, fi*iendly reader, you wish to enteLv 
tain your mouth widi a superlative beefwrteak, 
you most have the inside oS the sirloiu cut 
mio steaks. Hie next best steaks are those 
cut from the middle of a rump, thathas beoi 
killed at least four day^in moderate weather, 
and much longer in cold weather, when they 
can be cut about six inches long, four inchoi 
wide, and half an inch thick: do not beat 
tfaeoi, which vulgar trick breaks the cells in 
which the gravy of the meat is contained, 
aad it beoonMs dry and tasteless. N. B. —

taking care not to disturb the sediment. 
Cofiee made in this mknner will he of the

PREPARING. 1st. Let your cofl^ bo dry, 
not in the least mouldy or damaged.— -20* 
Divide Uie quantity that is to be roasted into 
two parts. — 3d. Koa^t the fint part in a 
coffee-roaster, the handle of whicii mi»t be 
kept constantly turning until the cofiee be- 
comes the color of dried almonds or bread- 
raspings, and has lost one eighth of its 
weight.-~4th. Roast the second part until 
it assumes the fine brown color of chestmita, 
and has k)6t one fifth of its weight. — 5ch. 
Mix the two parts togedier, and grind them 
in a cofl^ mill.— 6th. Do not roast or mako 
your coffee until the day it is wanted. — 7th. 
To two ounces of ground coffee, put four 
cups of cold water. Draw off this mfiBion, 
and put it aside. — 8th. Put to the oofliM 
which remains in die Inggin, three cups of 
boiling water, then drain it ds and add Ibis 
infusion to dwt which has beea put aside. 
By this method you obtain three cups more, 
when your co^ is wanted, heat it quickly 
in a silver coffee-pot, taking care not to 1^ 
it boil, that the perfume may not be lost b^ 
undergoing any evaporation. Then pour it 
into cups, which each person may sweeten 
according to his taste. Particular care 
^lould be taken not to make coffee in a tin 
vessel ; it should be made either in a China 
vessel, or one of Delfl ware, or in one of

is a very fiirorite sauce with lamb or muttoi^ 
cutlets, stewed nimp-steoks, &c. &c. : when 
made for die latter, a third part of sliced 
onion is stmietimes fried with the cucundbei. 

COJCUMBERS AND ONIONS, SU&

quick ; add Uie rest by degrees, till it is afl 
well mixed; then poui* it back inio a stew- 
pan, and leave it by the side of the fire to 
simmer for half an hour longer, that tibe 
thickening may thoroughly incoiporate with 
the gravy, die stewpan being only half cov- 
end, stirring it every now and then ; a aoft 
of scum will gatho* on die top, which it is 
best not to take off till you are ready to 
strain it through a tamie. Take care it is 
neither of too pale nor too dark a coIcm*; if 
it is not thick enough, let it stew longer, tiB 
it is reduced to the desired thickness; or 
add a bit of slaze, or portable soup to it, 
if it is too diick, you can easily thin it with 
a spoonful or two of warm broth, or water. 
When your sauce is done, stir it in Ute ba- 
sin you put it iitt6 once <Nr twice, while it is 
cooling.

and pour over half a pint of water, stew 
them gent] V for half an hour, shaking them 
occasionalfy ; befora serving, add a little 
grated nutmeg, and the juice of half a lemon, 

EELS SPITCHCOCKED. This the 
French cooks call the Enfflish wayof dress- 
iog eels. Take two miadling-«ized silver 
e^, scour them with 9^1t, slit them on the 
bdly side, and take oot the bones and wash 
nod wipe than taotty i then cut them into 
pieces dbout tlieee inches long, and wipe 
Ihem quite dry ; put twfi QMoce^ of butter 



Bite a idjwpaa with a littla flriDeed panley» 
thyme, sage, pepper, and salt, and a ¥ecy

stir the ingredients together, and take it off 
the fire, mix the ^^Iks of two eggs with them» 
and dip the eel m, a piece at a time, and 
thai roll them in bread-crumbs, making aa 
much stick to them as you can ; then rub

over a very clear fire, and broil your eels of 
a fine crisp brown. Dish tliem with crisp 
parsley, mid send up with plain butter in a 
boat, and anchovy and butter. 

EGGS. (1) E^s[s may be preserved fi^r 
twelve months, in a sweet and palatable ctote 
for eating in the shell, or using for salads, by 
boiling them for one minute; and when 
wanted for use let them be boiled in the 
usual manner: the white may be a little 
toucher than a new^id egg, but tlie yolk 
will show no difierence. 

EGGS. <2) Pour a ^lon of water 
over a pound of unslacked lime, stir it well; 
the following day» pour off the clear water 
into a jar, and put in the eggB as they are 
laid. In this manner they will continue 
perfectly good for six months <Hr more. 
^ There are so many different ways of 
dressing eg^, that the I'ecipes would almost 
fill a volume ; we have, dierefore, given such 
as we esteem the best, and the most adapted 
to the English taste. 

EGGS AND BACON RAGOUT. 
Boil half a dozen eggs f<Nr ten minutes; 
throw them into cold water; peel diem and 
cut them into halves ; pound the yolks in a 
marble mortar, with almnt an equal quantity 
of the white meat of dressed'fowl, or veal, a 
little diopped parsley, an anchovy, an escha* 
lot, a quarter of an ounce of butter, a table-- 
spoonful of mushroom catchup, a little Cay-^. 
enne, some bread-crumbs, and a very little 
beaten mace, or allspice ; incorporate tliem 
wdl together, and fill the halves of the

a Dutcli oven, and serve them on relishing 
rashers of bacon or ham. 

EGGS AND BREAD. Put half a hand- 
fol of bread crumbs into a saucepan, with a 
small quantity of cream, salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and let it stand till the bread haa 
imbibed all the cream ; then break ten egg«

pepper, boil them togedier, till the c^gs 
are partly hard ; pass a salamander over' the 
top, and serve. 

EGGS A LA TRIPE. Cut into Uiick 
.round slices a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, 
fand piit tliem into the following sauce: cut 
'three ku^ white onions into dice, fry them 
< white in butter, and when nearly done, dust 
•-them with flour, and moisten them with some 

milk and a few spoonfuls of cream; keep 
'Btirring with a wooden spoon, to prevent 
■tlieir burning. When the sauce is done, 

grate in a liltie nutmeg, season with a little 
. salt and pepper, and put in the eggs. 

EGG BALLS. Boil four eggs for ten 
ininutes, and put them into cold water ; when 
jthey ai'e quite cold, put the yolks into a 
-mortar witii the yolk of a raw egg, a tea- 
spoonful of flour, same of chopped parsley, 
.as much salt as will lie on a sliilling, and a 
little black pepper, or Cayenne; rub them 
well together, roll tlicra into small balls (as 
they swell in boiling) ; boil them a couple 
. of minutes. 

EGGS BOILED, to eat in the 
•SHELL, OR FOR SALADS. The fresher 
laid the better: put them into boiling water; 
if you like the white just set, about two ^ 
minutes boiling is enough ; a new-laid egg 
will take a little more; if you wish the yolk 
'to be set, it will take three, and to boil it 
hard for a salad, ten minutes. A new>-laid 
egg will re({uire boiling longer tlian a Stale 
one, by half a minute. 

EGGS BOURGEOISE. Spread some 
'butter over tlie bottom of a dish, cover it 
.entirely with tliin slices of crumb of bread, 
on tliat lay thin 'slices of cheese, tlien eight 
or ten eggs, season them with salt, pepper

a saucepan and keep turning it one way 
till melted; put in the beaten eggs, and stir 
them round with a silver spoon till they bet- 
come quite thick. Serve them in a dish 
upon buttered toast. They may be eaten 
.with fish, fowl, or sausages. 

EGGS EN SURPRISE. Take a dozen 
■eggs J and make a small hole at eacli end of 
■ every esg, through which pass a straw and 
break the yolk ; then blow out the yolk care- 
fully. Wash the sliells, and having drained, 
di-y them in the open air ; mix tlie yolk of 
an egg with a little flour to close one of the 
holes of the shells, and when dry, fill half the 
ejmmber by means of a small frumel, with 



chocolate ci«iim, and the remaining six widi 
cofiee or orange-cream ; ckwe the other end 
of your eggs, and put them into a saucepan 
of liot watery set them on the fire, taki^ 
care tliey do not boil ; when done, remawe 
tlie cement from the eade^ dry, and serte 
them on a folded na[dcin. 

EGGS, FRIED. Eggs boiled hard, cut 
into slices, and fi'ied, may be served as a 
second course didh, to eat with roasted 
chickens. 

EGGS FRIED WITH BACON. Jakj 
some slices of fine streaked bacon (not mors 
than a quarter of an inch thick) in a clean 
dish, and toast tliem before the fire in a 
clieese-tuaster, turning diem when tlie upper 
side is Inrowned; first ask those who are U> 
eat the bacon, if tliey wish it much or littk 
done, t. e. curled and crisped, or mdbw 
and soft: if the latter, parboil it first. WeB- 
cleansed dripping, or lard, or fresh butter, 
are the best ftits for frying eggs. Be sure 
the frying-pan is quite clean ; when tlie &t 
is hot, break two or three eggs into it ; do 
not turn them, but, while tliey are frying, 
keep pouring some of the fat over them with 
a spoon ; when the yolk just begins to look 
white, which it will in about a couple of 
minutes, they are done enough; tlie white 
must not lose its transparency, but the yolk 
be seen blushing dirough it: if they are 
done nicely, th^ will look as white and 
delicate as if tliey 'had been poached; take 
tliem up with a tin slice, drain die fot from 
tliem, trim them neatly, and send them up 
with tlie bacon round them. 

EGGS FRIED, AND MINCED HAM 

OR BACON. Choose some fine salt poik« 
streaked widi a good deal of lean ; cut this 
into very thin slices, and afterward iirte 
small square pieces; tlirow them into a 
stewpan, and set it over a gende fire, diat 
they may lose some of their iat. Wlien as 
much as will freely come is thus melted fixmi 
them, lay diem on a warm dish. Put into 
a stewpan 'a ladle-fiill of melted bacon or 
lard ; set it on a stove ; put in about a dozen 
of the small pieces of bacon, dien stoc^ the 
stewpan and break in an egg. Manage this 
carefully, and die e^ will presently be done: 
it will be very rouiu), and the little dice of 
bacon will stick to it all over, so that it will 
make a very pretty appearance. Take cara 
the yolks do not Wden ; when the ege is 
thus done, lay it car^ully in a warm dish, 
and do the otiiers, 

EGG FRITTERS. Pound a dom 
hard boiled eggs with a little cream, and a 
quarter of a pound of be^ marrow; then 
pound half a aoKco macaroons, some bitler 



£G0

ELD 



afanands, a little aqgar, and lonon-tMiet; 
mix theee with the pounded eggs, and form 
them into fritters, dip them into a batter 
made with flour, butter, salt, and lemon- 
peel ; firy them in very hot lard, sprinkle su- 
gar over, and serve. 

EGGS FROTHED. Beat up the yolks 
of eight eggs and the whites of four (set 
aside the remaining whites) with a spoonful 
of water, some salt, sugar, and the juice of a 
lemon ; fry this, and then put it on a dish ; 
whip the four whites (which were set aside) 
to a froth with sugar, and place it over tlie 
fried eggs ; bake it in a Dutch oven, or with 
a high cover fitted for tlie purpose. 

EGGS, GLASS. Butter a diifh, and 
break into it a piece of butter nearly as large 
as an eg^: add a tea-cupful of cream, and 
drop in ^ur or five eggs; put upon each a 
little pepper and salt, set the dish upon a 
stove, and serve it when the eggs are firm, 
which may be in ten or fifteen minutes. 

EGG MARMALADE. (1) Blancli and 
pound with a little rose wata*, two ounces of 
Sweet almonds, the same of orange marmalade, 
and four of citron ; add two spoonfuls of bran- 
dy, and when quite smooth, the beaten yolks of 
SIX and the whites of two e^gs, with a little 
pounded loaf sugar ; put it into a saucepan, 
and stir it till it becomes thick, tlien pour it 
into a shape. When quite cx)ld, serve it, 
turned out and garnished with flowers. 

EGG MARMALADE. (2) CJlarifVapound 
of sugar, keeping it ratlier thick ; when cool, 
add to it the yulks of twenty e^^, which 
should be perfectly fi-ee firom the whites, and 
well stirred, but not beaten; set these on 
die fire, stirring continually until it boils, and 
then continue to stir until sufficiently thick ; 
if any scum should arise, it need not be taken 
oflf, as the boiling and stirring will eflectually 
remove it. Orange-flower water may be 
added, if approved. 

EGGS, TO POACH. The cook who 
wishes to display her skill in poaching, 
must endeavour to procure eggs that have 
been laid a couple of days — moae that are 
quite new-laid are so milky that, take all 
the care you can, your cooking of them will 
seldom procure you the praise of being a 
prime poacher ; you must have fted^ eggs, 
or it is equally impossible. The beauty of 
a poachea egg is for the yolk to be seen 
bliisbing through the white, which should 
only be just sufficiently hardened, to form a 
trainparent veil for the esg* Have some 
boiling water in a tea-ketulB ; pass as much 
of it through a clean ck>th as will half fill a 
■tewpan; break the egg into a cup, and 



when the water boils, rsmove'the slsmpin 
fit>m the stove, and gratfy slip the egg mlo* 
it; it must stand till the white is set; tbsa 
put it over a very moderate fire, and as soon 
as the water boils, the egg is ready ; take it 
up with a slice, and neatly round off the 
railed edges of the wrhite; send them up on 
iN^d toasted <m one side only, with or witl^- 
out butter; or without a toast, garnished 
with streaked baonn nicely fried, or slices 
of broiled beef or mutton, anchovies, nork 
sausages, or spinage. The bread should be- 
a little largfv than the egg, and about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; only just give it a 
yellow color: if you toast it brown, it wiU 
^t a bitter flavour ; or moisten it by pour- 
ing a little hot water opon it: some sprinkle 
it witli a few drops of vinegar, or of esseooe 
of ancho\y. 

EGGS POACHED, with Sauce or 
MINCED Ham. Poach the eggs as befiwv 
directed, and take two or three slices of 
boiled ham ; mince it fine with a gherkin, a 
morsel of onion, a little parsley, and pepper 
dnd salt ; stew all together a quarter of an 
hour ; seiTe up your sauce about half boiling ; 
put tlie eggs in d dish, squeeze over the juice 
of half a Seville orange, or lemon, and pour- 
the sauce over them. 

EGG PUNCH. Take a punch-glass, 
and put into it a wine-dass of sirup of pimch 
(see tliat article), and the yolk of an egg; 
beat them togetlier with a spoon, and thai 
fill up the glass with boiling water, stirring 
a little as you poiur it in. 

EGG TOAST. Put a. glass of thick 
cream, some sugar, two or tluoe macaroons 
pounded, with a few almonds, a litUe grated 
lemon, give them a boil ; tlien add the yolks 
of eight and whites of tliree eggs, beat the 
whole up over a slow fire ; and lay on very 
thin slices of fried bread; spriiiKle sugar 
over, and serve* 

EGG WINE. Beat up an egg, mix with 
it a spoonful of cold water ; set on the fire a 
glass of white wine,> half a glass of water,, 
sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour a 
litde of it to the egg by degrees, till the 
whole is in, stirring it well } then return the 
whole into the saucepan, set it over a gentle 
fire, stir it one way (or a minute, not lonser, 
for if it boil, or the egg is stale, it will curdle ; 
sei*ve with toast. You may make it as above^ 
without warming the egg, and it will be 
lighter on the stomach, Uiough not so agree* 
able to the palate. 

ELDER FLOWER FRITTERS. 
They are made w;hilst the elder flowers are 
in bloom; and they should marinate three

«r hat hooni in bnndy, sugar »0rai^;e41owier 
water, and lemon-peel; when drained, dip 
them in 'a good think batter to fry, and serve 
with rasped sugar, as in general. 

ELDER ROB. Gather the elderberries 
when quite ripe» put them into a stone jar, 
tie a bladder or paper ow the top, and 
place the jar in a pan of water ; let it boil 
till the berries are very soft; strain them 
through a coarse cloth, and to every pint of 
juice aJSow half a pound of good brown ^• 
gar; pot it into a preserving-pan, stir it, and 
when it boils, take off the scum, and let it 
boil for one hoar. 

ELDER VINEGAR. Choose the elder- 
flowera when just blown, take away all the 
stalks, and when the flowers are about 
half dry, put them into a jar, and fill the jar 
witli vinegar, close it tight, and let it stand 
in the sun for twenty days; tlien draw it off, 
press the flowers, and having filtered the 
whole, bottle it ; take care to keep tlie bot- 
tles closely corked. 

ELDERBERRIES. Oan be made to 
produce excellent wine, allowing to a ten- 
gallon cask forty pounds of fruit, forty pounds 
of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar. 
When elderberry wine is desired for a warm 
cordial, it is made in tlie following manner: 
—Twenty-five pounds of fruit are to be boil- 
ed for an hour, in eleven gallons of water, 
and along with it, tied in a piece of linen, 
one ounce of allspice, and two of ginger; 
forty pounds of sugar being put into a tub, 
the boiling liquor is strained over it, pressing 
the fruit quite dry ; a quarter of a pound of 
crude tartar, or ca^eam of tartar, is dien 
added to the liquid. When it has stood two 
days in the tub, it may be removed to the 
cask, treated, as for sweet wine, in the usual 
manner, and bottled in Msurch following. 
When to be drank, a portion of it is heated 
with some sugar, two or three cloves, and a 
Hide nutm^. 

EMPOTAGE. Put into a large sauce- 
pan, three or four pounds of beef-steaks, a 
knuckle of veal, and four old hens ; moisten 
this quantity of meat with two ladlesful of 
broth; set it on a stove, and let it boil till 
]Hroperly reduced, taking care that none of 
the meat bums, which would make the 
empoU^e of too high a color; fill up your 
siiucepan with broth, adding carrots^ turnips, 
and onions; let all these mgredients stand 
over the fire for three hours smd a half; then 
strain the whole through a siflc sieve, that 
it may be perfectly clear. 

ENDIVE IN VELOUTE. Take off 
all the outer leaves of your endive, aad having 



opened die hearts, put them into coM witer 
to wash them. In the meanwhile heat a 
kettle of water, put in it a handful of salt, 
then throw in the endive ; keep it constandjr 
under the water, to prevent their turning 
black. As soon as the endive is tender, 
drain, and then put it into cold \^'ater, and 
when quite cold, drain it again ; press the 
water out witli your hands ; then chop it 
small, and put it into a saucepan, with some 
butter, salt, and pepper, stir it well, and 
then add five spoonfuls of veioute, the sams 
of eonsomm«; reduce it till pretty thick, and 
then put it in a dish, with fi^ed br^ romd 
it. Endive may also be dressed with cream, 
in which case, pot two spoonfuls of fiour into 
it, and moisten it with cream. 

ENDIVE IN GRAVY OF VEAL 
Wash and clean thorougfaty ten or twehe 
heads of fine endive, take ofif the outer leaver 
and blanch tlie heads in hot virater; throw 
them into cold water, and then squeeze then 
as dry as possibly. Stew them in as modi 
gravy as will cover them ; add a tea-spoon- 
fill of pounded sugar, and a litde salt. When 
perfectly tender, put in a little vebute saocei 
and serve quite fafot. 

ENTREE. There is no word precis^ 
equivalent to this in English. Any dish of 
butcher's meat, fowl, game, or fisli, dresed 
for tttefirat course, is called an entree. 

ENTREMET, There is no word equif- 
alent to this in Englisli. All dishes of vtf- 
etables, jellies, pastries, salad, prawns, lob- 
sters, and, in general, everything that appears 
in tile second course, except the roast, u 
called an eniremet. 

ESCHALOT WINE. Peel, mince, and 
pound in a mortar, three ounces of eschaloti, 
and infuse them in a pint of Slierry for ten 
days ; then pour off the clear liquor on three 
ounces moi'e esdialots, and let the wi» 
stand on them ten days longer. .^'?J'

as almost all other preparations of garh^ 
onion, &c. do. N. B.— An ounce of serapw 
horseradish may be added to the above, ana 
a little thin-cut lemon-peel. 

ESPAGNOLE. Take an old fowl, and 
about fourteen pounds of le| or shoulder « 
veal ; chop the latter into pieces, and put Hi 
widi veiy little water, into a large sauowjan, 
with two carrots, three onions, a p»»no "

over a modRrute fira, shaking it frequently, 
tiH it beoooKs of a brown color, wben you 
may add to it a aufficieat quantity of Imt 
water, to oome about four inches above tha 
meat. Set it by (he side of die stove to boil 
gently, skimming, when neoessai-y, till the 
meat comes from die bones ; then strain it 
dmough a silk sieve, and set it by for use. 

ESSENCE. Take half a bottle of white 
wine, half a gbas of the best vinegar, die 
juice of two lemons, three ounces of salt, 
half an owMSe of whole pepper, a little not- 
m^ and mace, four ck>ves, four bay-leaves, 
, thyme, parsley, one small clove of garlic, ten 
ahalkiiB, pounded, and an ounce of dry mush- 
rooms; pat all these ingredients into an 
earthen pan, over a brisk fire ; when near 
boiling, lessen the fire, and let it stand 
OD hot a^ies lor six or seven hours; then 
strain it through a coarse sieve, and after- 
wards filter it. Keep it in closely corked 
botdes: a small quantity is sufficient to fla- 
vour a dish. 



F. 



FANCHONETTES. Put into a sauce- 
pan, two ounces of flour, three of sugar, one 
of butler, two df pounded almonds, some 
green lemtm-fjeel, two yolks, and one whole 
egg, a little salt, and half a pint of milk ; 
put these ingredients on die fire, and let diem 
set like a cream ; line some tartlet-tins, or 
mouUs, with puff paste, fill them with the 
nreparatiou; place the moulds on a tin, and 
bake the fanchonetUs in a brisk oven ; when 
about three parts done, take them out, put 
firodied eggs on, sprinkle sugar over, and re- 
place thefflu in the oven to finish the baking. 

FAWN, Like a sucking pig, should be 
d r cuaed almost as soon as killed. When 
tery youi^, it is trussed, stuffed, and spit- 
ted the same way as a liare: but diey are 
better eating when of the size of a house 
Samb, and are then roasted in quarters ; the 
hiod-<)uar(er is most esteemed. 

They must be put down to a very quick 
fire, aim either basted all the time they are 
roasting, or be covered with sheets of fat 
bacon; wrhen done, baste it with butter, and 
dredge it with a little salt and flour, till 
yoa make a nice fi'oth on it. 

N. B.—- We advise our friends to half 
roast a &wn as soon as diey receive it, and 
then make a hash of it. 

Send up venison sauce with it. 

FILBERT ROLLS. Having tieekd

half a pcNBd of fiftMi, pttt then iato • 
preserving pan over a moderate fira, wad 
stir them constantly with a motuk ontil 
they become equally coktnd of a light yet 
k»w: then set them to oool. When cold, 
pound them with a little white of egg to a 
paste ; dien mix them with half a pound of 
flour, the same of powder sugar, and the 
yolks of four or five eggs, and then finirii 
die operation as directed for almond roUt, 
Froth, and trace on the surface an ear of 
wheat, 'or anything else, with the point of a 
knife: take care to dry them well in the 
baking, that th^ may be crisp. Coarse 
powdo* sugar may also be strewed over, b^ 
fore they are put m the oven. 

FISH. We insert all the beat remark» 
that variotu culinary authors have made 
on Fish. 

Tliere is a general rule in choosing 
most kinds of fish; if their gills are reo, 
their eyes plump, and the whole fish stiff, 
they are good ; if^ on the contrary, the gills 
are pale, die eyes sunk, and the fish flabby, 
they are stale. The greatest care should 
be taken that the fish is properly cleansed 
before being dressed, but not washed be- 
yond what is absolutely necessary fdr clean- 
ing, as by perpetual watering, the flavour 
is diminished. When clean, if the fish is 
to be boiled, some salt, and a little vin^^ar 
should be put into the water, to give it 
finuncss. Cure should be taken to boil the 
fish well, but not to let it break. Cod, 
whiting, and haddock are much better for 
being a little salted, and kept for a day. 

There is uften a inuddv smell and taste at- 
tached to fresh-water fusb, which may be 
got rid of by soaking it, af^er it has beeo 
dioronghly cleaned in sti'ong salt and wa« 
tcr ; or, if the fish is not too large, scald it 
in the same ; then dry, and dress it. 

Care should be taken diat the fish is put into 
cold water, and allowed to do very gently, 
odierwise the outside will break before Che 
inside is done. 

Crimp fish must be put into boiling water; 
and as soon as it bolls up, a little cold 
water- should be put in, to check die exoes^ 
siv^ heat, and simmer it for a few minutes. 

If the fish b not taken out of the water 
the instant it is done, it will become wool- 
ly; to asceiiain when it is ready, the fish 
plate on which it is dressed may be drawn' 
up, and if sufficiently done, it will leave the 
bone. To keep hot for serving, and to 
prevent it from losing its color, the fish, 
plate should be placed crossways over the 
fish-kettle, and a clean cloth put over the fish. 

Small fish may be either nicely firied' 
plain, or done over with egg and bread' 
crumbs, and then fried. Upon the dish on, 
which the fish is to be served, should' 1m

phoed a folded danMik napkio, and apon 
this put Ibe fivh, with the liver and roe; 
Chen garnkih the dish widi borae-raditih, 
parsley, and kuion. FLih is a di«b which 
IS aloKwt more attended to than any other. 

To £7 or broil fish properly, after it 
is well cleaned and washed, it should be 
wrapped in a nice soft cloth, and when 
fectly dry, wetted with egg, and spriiik- 
all over with very fine bread crumbs ; it 
will look still better to be done over with 
egg and crumbs a second time. ' Then hav- 
ing on the fire a thick-bottomed fi-ying-pan, 
with plenty of lard or dripping, boiling hot ; 
put the fish into it, and let it fry tolerably 
quick till it is done, and of a nice brown 
yellow. If it is done before it has obtained 
a nice brown color, the pan should be drawn 
to the side of the fire, the fish carefully 
taken up, and placed either upon a sieve 
turned upwards, or on the under side of 
a dish, and placed before the tire to dram, 
and finish browning; if wanted particularly 
nice, a sheet of cap paper must be put to 
receive the fish. Fish fi-ied in oil obtains a 
much finer color than when done in lard or 
dripping. Butter should never be used, as 
it give:! a bad color. Garnish your dish 
with a (jringe of curled raw parsley, or with 
fried parsley. 

When fish is to be broQed, it must be 
seasoned, floured, and done on a vei-y clean 

Kidiron; which, when hot, should be rub- 
d over with suet, to hinder the fish firom 
•tickinff. It should be broiled over a very 
dear we, to prevent its tasting smoky, and 
gi^eat care must be taken not to scorch it. 

FISH. This department of the busi- 
ness of the kitchen requires considerable ex- 
perience, and depends more upon practice 
than any other. A very few moments, more 
or less, will thoroughly spoil fish ; which, to 
be eaten in perfection, must never be put 
on the table tdl the soup is taken off. 

80 many circumstances operate on this 
occasion, that it is almost impossible to 
write general rules. 

Th^ are decidedly diflEerent opinions, 
whether fish should be pot into cold, tepid, 
or boiling water. 

Fish must by no means be allowed to re- 
main in the water afler it is boiled; if 
therefore it should be ready before it can be 
sent to table, it must be dished, the cover 
||^ on, and a cloth put over it. The dish 
18 then to be set across the fish-kettle. 

Fish should be firied over a clear quick 
6re ; and with drifting, or bog*s lard in 
preference to butter. The (jan should be 
deep; and to ascertain that it b clean, a 
little £it is first fried in it, poured out, and 
ttie pan wiped with a clean cloth; as much 
dii{]^[Mng or lard is then pat in as will en- 



tirely cover the lish. When it ii boflSag 
hot, and begins to sOHdce, the fish is put in ; 
if small, th^ may be turned in three or four 
minutes, by sticking in a fork near the head 
with one liand, and with the other siqipavt- 
ing the tail with a fish-slice. When they 
are done, they should be laid before the 
fire upon an old soft towel, and turned now 
and tlien till they are dry upon both sides; 
or they may be put upon a lai^ aieve^ 
turned upwards, and which is kept for the 
purpose, or put on the under side of a dish. 

The fire for broiling fish must b» yeij 
clear, and the gridiron perfectly dean, 
which, wlien hot, shodd be nibbed with a 
bit of suet. The fish, while broiling, must 
be often turned. 

Several respectable fishmongers and ex- 
perienced cooks have assurea the editor, 
that they are often in danger of loeinff their 
credit by fish too fresh, and especially tnr* 
bot and cod, which, like meat, require a 
certain time before they are in the best con- 
dition to be dressed. They reoommeod 
them to be pot into cold water, salted in 
proportion of about a quarter of a pound of 
salt to a gallon of water. Sea-water is 
best to boil sea-fish in. It not only saves the 
expense of salt, but the flavor is better. Let 
them boil slowly till done; the sign of which 
is, that the skin of the fi»h rises up, and 
the eyes turn white. 

It is the business of the fishmonger to 
clean them, &c. but the carefiil co<ml wiM 
always wash them again. 

Garnish with slices of lemon, findy scrap- 
ed horseradish, fi-ied oysters, smelts, wfait- 
inss or strips of soles. 

Tlie liver, roe, and chitterliiws should be. 
placed so that the carvor may observe them, 
and invite the guest tp partake of them. 

Fish, like meat, requires more cooking 
in cold than in warm weather. If it b^ 
comes FROZEN, it must be thawed fay the 
means we have directed for meat. 

Fish are plenty and good, and in great 
variety, in all the towns and cities on the 
extensive coast of the United States. Some 
of the interior towns are also sofi^ied wiA 
fish peculiar to the lakes and rivers of this 
country. 

All Kinds of fiflb are best sometime bdbre 
they begin to spawn; and are unfit (or food 
for sometime after they have spawned. 

Fish, like animals, are fittest for the ta- 
ble when they are just full grown ;^and what 
has been said reniecting v^petables, applies 
equally wdl to fish. 

The most convenient utensil to boil iA 
in, is a turbot-kettle. This shouki be 
twenty-four inches long, twenty-two wide, 
and nine deep. It is an excellent vesed to 
boil a ham in, &c. &c.

For liqaids, you have meat gravy, lemon-

the various vegetable esBenoee, mudiroom 
catchup, and the whites and yolks of eggs, 
wines, and the essence of spices. 

TISH, NEW KKTHOD OP DRESSING. 

Take any sort of fidi you think proper, be- 
ing very careful that it is quite freidi ; clean 
it thoroughly, dry, and season it to your 
taste; Xh&a put it (without any moisture), 
into a pan, which may be closely covered, 
with tlie exception ofa small bole, to allow 
of evaporation. Put it into an oven as soon 
as the bread is di'awn, and let it stand until 
the whole is so completely dissolved, that 
the bones are not perceptible. When cold, 
this makes a very tran^iarent, well-flavored 
jelly. 

FISH CX>NSOMME. Take carp, tench, 
perch, e^, pike, and other fresh-water fish 
xyf tiie same kind ; clean them well, and cut 
them into pieces, as near of a size as may 
he ; /ay them in a stewpan, on a layer of 
aliced onions and carrots ; as soon as diey 
begin to sweat, put in a bit of butter, and 
leave them for a quarter of an hour; mois- 
ten them with fish broth, and let them boil 
gently for an hour; keep the pan closely 
covered ; this will aifford a very nourishing 
broth. 

FISH KETCHUP. Take rather more 
than a pint of vinegar, three pints of nod 
Port, two table-spoonfulis of pepper, pound- 
ed very fine, plenty of diallots and horse- 
radish, tlie peel of half a lemon, and two or 
three bay-leaves, and a pound of anchovies; 
let tile whole boil together until the ancho- 
vies are dissolved, dien strain, and when 
cold, put it into bottles. Two or three 
spoonfuls are sufficient for a pound of 
butter. 

FISH FORCEMEAT. Take two oun- 
ees of either turbot, sole, lobster, shrimps, 
or oysters; free from skin, put it in a mor- 
tar with two ounces of fiesh butter, one 
ounce of bread-crumbs, the yolk of two eggs 
boiled hard, and a little eschalot, grated 
lemon-peel, and parslev, minced very fine; 
dien pound it well till it is thoroughly mixed 
and quite smooth; season it wim salt and 
Oavenne to vour taste ; break in the yolk 
and white of one egg, rub it well together, 
and it is ready (at use. Oysters parboiled 
and minced fine, and an anchovy, may be 



FISH GRAVY. (1) -Cbt two or three 

little fish of any kind into small pieces; pal 
them into a s a ucepa n , with rather more 
water than will cover them, a bit of toasted 
bread, a Made of mace, some lemon-peel, 
whole pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs; 
let it simmer gently till it is rich and good; 
brown a little bit of butter in a stewpaa, 
and when it is browned, strain the gravy ii^ 
to it, and let it boil for a few minutes. 

FISH GRAVY. (2) Put some slioee 
of onion into a stewpan, and set them on 
the fire; when th^ are completely dissolved, 
add a piece of butter, and some small fish, 
or pieces of carp, tench, perch, or any other 
you find convenient. As soon as they begin 
to difvolve, and give out their moisture, put 
a glassful of root broth to them, and boil 
diein for half an hour; then add a glass of 
white wine, and a little lemon-juice, and 
boil it another half hour, when it may be 
pressed through a si^ve, with great force. 

FISH RECHAUFFE. (1) After pike, 

cod, skate, tuiiwt, soles, or any other white 
fish has been dressed, pick it (torn the bonee 
into small bits ; add to a pound of fish, or 
in the same proportion, half a pint of good 
cream, one table-spoonful of mustard, the 
same of anchovy essence, the same of ketch- 
up, and of Han'ey sauce, a little flour, some 
salt, pepper, and butter; make it all hot in 
the saucepan, then put it into the dish in 
which it IS to be served up, strew crumfae 
of bread over it, and baste it with butter till 
it is a little moist, then brown it with a 
salamander, or in a Dutch oven. A wall 
of mashed potatoes round the dish is an im- 
provement. 

FISH RECHAUFFE. (2) Pick fiwn 
the bone in large flakes about two pounde 
of cokl salmon, cod fish, or soles; >melt a 
quarter of a pound of butter in half a pint of 
cream, with a little flour and salt; add the 
fish and heat it thoroughly. 

FISH SAUCE. See Saueee, 

FLEMISH WAFERS. Put into a 
deep pan half a pound of flour; strain and 
mix with it half a pint of wanned milk, and 
two table-spoonfiils of fresh yeast; work tlie 
paste till it be soft and smooth, and place it 
m a stove, or ckme to the fire, to rise; then 
add the beaten volks of six eggs, lialf a 
pound of fresh butter beaten to a cream, 
and a lump of sugar which has been rubbed 
upon the peel of a lemon, and then pounded; 
last of alU beat in light ^ the well-whisked 
whites of the eggs ; a^in place the pan in 
a warm place, and it will rise to neariyr 
double its bulk. Heat apd nib the inmf

M one side with the mixture, and close 
them ; when one side is done turn the oth- 
er, and when of a fine color, take out the 
wafers ; put them upon a plate, and whilst 
hot, sift over this Quantity a quarter of a 
pound of grated loai sugar. 

FLIP. To make a quart of flip:— Put 
the ale on the fire to warm, and beat up 
three or four eggs, witli four ounces of moist 
sugar, a tea-spoonfiil of grated nutmeg or 
ginger, and a quartern of good old rum or 
brandy. When the ale nearly boils put it 
into one pitcher, and the rum, eggs, &c. in- 
to another; turn it from one to another till 
it is as smooth as cream. This is called a 
Yard of Flannel. 

FLOATING ISLAND. Boil, with a 
pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, and half the 
peel of a lemon; when almost cold, strain it, 
and mix with it die beaten white of one, and 
the yolks of three eggs ; stir it over the fire till 
thick, poqr it into a dish, and stir it now 
and then till cold. Whisk the whites of 
two eggs, and half a pint of Guava, quince, 
or red cun'aiit jelly, till it be a very stiff. 

FLOUNDERS BOILED. (1) Put on a 
stewpan with a sufficient quantity of waJer 
to cover tlie flounders which are to be dres- 
sed; put in some vinegar and horse-radish; 
when the water boils put in the fish, having 
been first well cleaned, and their fins cut off; 
they must not boil too fast for fear diey should 
brc»k; when they are sufficiently done, lay 
them on a fish plate, the tails in the middle. 
Serve them with parsley and butter. 

FLOUNDERS BOILED. (2) Wash and 
clean them well, cut tlie black side of them 
the same as you do ti.irbot, then put them in- 
to a fish-kettle, with plenty of cold water 
and a handful of salt ; when they come to a 
boil, skim them clean, and let them stand 
by the side of the fire for five minutes, and 
thev are ready. 06«.^Eaten with plain 
melted butter and a lilde salt, you have the 
sweet delicate flavor of tlie flounder, which 
is overpowered by any sauce. 

FLOUNDERS or PLAICE, fried or 
BOILED. Flounders are perhaps the most 
difiicult fish to fry very nicely. Clean them 
well, flour tliem, and wipe them with a di'y 
cloth to absorb all the water from them ; 
flour or egg and bread-«rumb them. 

FLUMMERY. Steep thr«e large hand- 
fids o( very small white oatmeal a day and 
night in cold water; then pour it off clear; 
Uwn odd as much more water, and let it 
«taiid another day and a oi^t, Ttwn 



strain it tbroii^ a fine hair sieve, and bofl 
it till it is of the consistence of hasty, pod- 
ding, keeping it well stirred all tlie time it 
is boiling. Wlien first strained, put to it 
one large spoonful of white sugar, and two 
of orange-flower water. Pour it into shal- 
^low dislies, and serve to eat with wine, ci- 
der, milk or cream, and sugar. 

FLUMMERY DUJCH. Boil very 
gently for half an hour, two ounces of isin- 
glass in three half pints of water ; add a pint 
of white wine, the juice of three lemons and 
the thin rind of one, and rub a few lumps 
of sugar on another to obtain the essence, 
and with them add as mudi more sugar as 
will make it sufficiently sweet; and liaving 
beaten up the yolks of seven eggs, give them 
and the above, when mixed, one scald; stir 
all tlie time, and \yo\ir die whole into a ba- 
sin ; stir it till it is half cold ; (hen let it 
settle, and put it into a melon shape. 

FLUMMERY FRENCH. Beat air 
ounce of isinglass fine, put it into a quart of 
cream, and boil it gently for a quarter of an 
hour, keeping it stnring all die time. Then 
take it ofl', sweeten it widi fine powder su- 
gar, put in a spoonful of rose and another

a mould or liasiii, and when cold, turn it in- 
to a dish, and g.imish with currant jelly. 

FONDUS. Put some grated cheese into 
a basin, with pepper and a little melted but- 
ter, and the yulks of eggs; stir them togeth- 
er ; whip Uie whites of tlie eggs to a firm 
froth, and add them, a little at a time, to 
the ciieese, stirring lightly with a wociden 
spoon ; half fill as many fKiper ca^^s as yov 
can, and bake them, like biscuits, in a 
moderate oven. Serve them as quickly as 
possible after they are done. 

FORCEMEAT STUFFING. " Force- 
meat is now considered an indispensable 
accompaniment to most made dishes, and 
when composed with good taste, gives ad- 
ditional spirit and relish to even that " sove- 
reign of savourincss," turtle soup. 

It is also sent up in patties, and for stuf- 
fing of veal, game, poultry, &c. 

The ingredients ^lould be so proportion- 
ed, that no one flavor predominates. 

To give the same stuffing for veal, hare, 
&c. argues a poverty of invention ; with a 
little contrivance, you may make as great 
a variety as you have dish^. 

The poignancy of forcemeat should be 
proportioned to die savouriness of the viands, 
to which it is intended to give an additional 
zest. Some dishes require a vei^ delicate- 
ly flavo^ foi-ce<peat, foe gdiers^ \\ WW4

pi^lu^mU in a turkey, wodd be unipid with 
tartlet 

Most people have ao acquired and pecu- 
liar taste in stufiingB, tec. and what exactly 
pleaaee one, seldom is precisely wluU an- 
other considerB the most agreeable. 

Custom is all io matters of tasle: it is not 
that one person is naturally fond of this or 
that, and anoUier Raturally averse to it; but 
that one is uaed to it, and anotlier is not. 

The consistency of forcemeats is rather a 
difficult thing to manage i they are almost 
always either too light or too heaiT. 

Take care to pound it till perfectly smooth, 
and that all the ingredients are thoroughly 
incorporated. 

Forcemeat-balls must not be larger than 
^ a small nittroeg. If they are for brown 
sauce, floor and fry them ; if for white, put 
them into boiling water, and boil tliem for 
three minutes: the latter are by far the most 
delicate. 

If not of sufficient stifiness, it &lls to 
pieces, and makes soup, Sec. grouty and 
▼ery unsightly. 

Sweetbreads and tongues are the favorite 
materials for forcemeat. Forcemeat should 
be made snflki^itly consistent to cut with a 
knife, but not di^ or heavy. No one flavor 
iliould predominate greatly; according to 
what it is wanted for, a selection may be^ 
made frcun the following list, being careful 
to use the least of those articles which are 
the most pungent:' 

Cold fowl, or veal, scraped ham, fat ba- 
con, beef suet, crumbs of bread, narsley, 
idiite pepper, salt, nutmeg, yolks and whites 
of ^gs, well beaten, to bind the mixture. 

tSb foroemeat may be made with any 
rf these articles without any striking flavor; 
therefore any of the following difierent ingre- 
dients may be made use of to vary tlie taste. 

Oysters, anchovies, tairagon, savory, pen- 
ny-royal, knotted-marjoram, thyme, basil, 
yolks of hard eggs, cayenne, garlic, shallots, 
diives, Jamaica peppor in fine powder, or 
two or three cloves. 

To force or stuff turkeys, geese, ducks, 
&c., see under the heads of the di&rent 
ways of dressing turkeys, geese, &c. 

FORCEMEAT. Take an equal quantity 
of lean veal scraped, and beef suet shred ; 
beat them in a marble mortar; add pepper, 
salt, cloves, pounded lemon-peel, and nutmee 
grated, parsley and sweet herbs, chopped 
fine, a little shallot and young onion, a few 
bread-crumbs grated fine, ^nd yolk of egg 
sufficient to work it light; roll this into 
balls with a little flour ; if for white sauce, 
boil them ; if for brown sauce, fiy them.

ready, put them in. « 

FOWLS. When a cock is young, his 
spurs are short; take care that you are 'not 
dieceived by their having been cut or pared, 
' a trick that is often practised. If fi'edi 
their vent will be close and dark. Hent 
are best, just before they begin to lay, and 
yet are foil ot egg; if they are old, their 
combs and legs are rough. 

All poultry should be very carefoily pick- 
ed, every plug removed, and: the hair nicely 
sinsed widi pap^. 

The cook should be cai^l in drawiiv 
pooltrv of all sorts, not to break the ^iC 
bag, for no washing will take off the bitter 
where it has touched. 

If for roasting, bladi-legged fowls art 
the most moist. A gpodniized fowl will 
take from three-quarters of an hour to an 
hour in roasting, a middling-eiied one about 
half an hour, and a very small one, or chidcF- 
&k, twenty minutes. 

Tame fowls require more roasting, and 
are longer in heating throueh than others. 
All sorts should be continually basted, that 
they may be served with a firoth, and appear 
of a fine color. The fire must be very quick 
and clear before any fowls are put dowa. 
Serve with egg sauce, bread sance, or gar- 
nished with sausages or scalded parsley. 

A large barn-door fowl, well hung, shookl 
be stuflfed in the crop with sausage-meat, 
and served with gravy in the dish, and with 
bread sauce. 

The head should be turned under th* 
wing, like a turkey.

Fowls are trussed in the same manner as 
chickens. (See Chickens). 

Chickens or fowls should be killed at 
least one or two days before tliey are to be 
dreraed. 

Turkmrs (especially large ones) should 
not be (iressed till they have been killed 
three or four days at least, in cold weather 
six or eight, or they will neither look white 
nor eat tender. 

Turlceys, and large fowls, should have 
the strings or sinews of tlie thighs drawn 
out.

are much easier carved. 

FOWL A LA HOLANDAISE, Make 
a forcemeat of grated bread, half its quantity 
of minced suet, an onion, or a few oysters, 
and some boiled parsley, season with pepper, 
salt, and grated lemon-peel, and an egg 
beaten up to bind it. Bone the breast of a 
good-fiized young ibwl, put in the forcemeat, 
cover the fowl with a piece of white paper 
buttered, and roast it i-ather more tlian half 
an hour; have ready a thick batter made of 
flour, milk, and eggs, take off the paper, and 
pour some of the batter over tlie fowl; as

FOWL MlNCED WITH VEAL. 

Mince the white part of a Culd roasted or 
boiled fowl ; put it^ and some thin slices of 
veal, inti) a saucepan^ also some white stock, 
a squeeze of a lemon, a few drops of sliallol 
viD^ar, and a dust of sugar ; simmer it for 
a short time, and serve it upon bread sippets, 
with the slices of veal laid on the mince. 

FOWL PULLED. Skin a cold chick- 
en, fmv\, or turkey ; take off tlie fillets from 
the breasts, and put tliem into a stewpan 
widi the rest of the white meat and win^s, 
side-bones, and merry-tliougiit, with a puit 
of bi-otli, a large blade of mace jwunded, an 
esclialot minced fine, the juice of half a lem- 
on, and a roll of tiie peel, some salt, and a 
Tew grains of cayenne ; thicken it with fluiu* 
and butter, and let it simmer for two or 
three minutes, till the meat is warm. In the 
meantime score the eggs and rump, powder 
them with pepper and salt, broil them nicely 
lM*own, and lay them on, or round your pulled 
chicken. Three taVle-epoonfuls of good 
cream, or the yolks of as many ^gs, will be 
a great improvement to it. 

FOWL OR RABBIT. We can only 
recommend tiiis method of dressing when tlie 
£re is not good enough for roasting. Pick 
and trnss it the same as for boiling, cut it 
opoi down' tlie back, wipe the inside clean 
with a cloth, seiison it with a littk) pepper 
and salt, have a cleai* fire, and set the grid- 
iron at a good distance over it, lay the 
chicken on with die inside towards the fire 
(you may egg it and strew some grated 
bread over it), and broil it till it is a fine 
lxx>wn: take care tlie fleshy side isnotlxim- 
ed. Lay it on a hot dish; pickled mush- 
rooms, or mushroom sauce thrown over it, 
or parelev and butter, or melted butter fla- 
vored witli mushroom ketchup. Garnish it 
with slices of lemon ; and the liver and giz- 
zard slit and notched, seasoned with pepper 
and salt, and broiled nicely brown^ with 
some slices of lemon. 

,FOWL8 WITH RICE, CALLED 
Pii.LACS. Boil a pint of rice in as much 
wutor as will cover it, with black pepper, a 
few blades of njace, and half a dozen cloves, 
tied up in a bit of ckrth; when the rice is 
toider, take out the spice ; stir in a piece 
of batter ; boil a fi>wl and a piece of bacon ; 
lay them in the dish, cover them with the 
rice: lay round the dish, and upon the rice, 
bard eg^, cut in halves, quarters, and 
lengthways, with onions, first boiled, and 
then fi-ied. 

FOWLS ROASTED. WeU pepper 
and salt the fowls before you spit them; 
roast them before a clear fire; froth them 



up when nearly done, by sprinkling then 
over with flour and salt, and besting dwrn 
with butter. When done, be carefiil in udi- 
ing out tlie skewers. Serve them with very 
good clear gravy in the dish, and brrad or 
egg sauce in a kwat. 

FOWL ROASTED WITH CHEST-- 
NUTS. Roast some chestnuts very care- 
fully, so that they may not be burnt, then 
take ofi* the skins, and peel them. Take 
about a dozen of them, cut them small, and 
bruise diem in a mortar. Parboil the liver 
of a fowl; bruise it, and cut about a quarter 
of a pound of ham or bacon, and pound it. 
Then mix them all together, with a good 
((uantity of chopped parsley, sweet herbs, 
some mace, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. When 
lhe:£e are are all well mixed together, put it 
into your fowl, and roast it. The bn^t wav 
of doing this is to tie tlie neck, and hang it 
up by the logn to roast, with a string, and 
then baste it with butler. For sauce, take 
tiie rest of the chestnuts, peel and skin them, 
put them into some good eravy, with a little 
white wine ; and thicken it widi a piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Then place your fowl 
in the dish ; pour in the sauce ; garnish with 
lemon, and serve. 

FOWL WITH ITS OWN GRAVY. 

Truss a fowl the same as for boiling, lard it 
quite through witli bacon, ham, and pars- 
ley ; put it in a pan with a little butter, two 
or three slices of peeled lemon, a bundle of 
sweet herbs, three cloves, sliced onions, 
can'ots, pepper, salt, a little stock, and a 
glass of white wine; stew them sently till 
diey are done ; skim and strain Uie sanoe, 
and serve it with the fowl. 

FOWL, WILD. The flavor of wiW 
fowl is preserved better by not stuffing them ; 
put into each, pepper, salt, and a bit of but- 
ter. Wild fowl do not require so mudi 
dressing as tame ; they should be dmie of a 
fine color, and nicely fi'othedl A rich browQ 

Sravy should be served in tlie dish, and when 
le breast is cut into slices, before it is taken 
from the bone, it will be much improved by 
a squeeze of lemon, some salt and oe^pper. 
If you wi^ to take off the fishy smell which 
tliese birds fi'equentl^ have, put an onion, 
salt, and hot water into the dripping pan, 
an(f for tiie first ten minutes baste them with 
this ; then remove the pan, and keep con- 
stantly basting with batter. 

FRAISE. See CkUfs CkUterHngM. 

FRANGIPANE. Take a saucepan, and

pint of milk, an onnce of butter and a little 
salt; set it on the fire, stirring constantly

tmSl it hn bofled ten mtnntei, taking great 
care that it does not bum ; then poor it into 
a basin, and let it coo). Take a few al- 
monds, (to every six sweet put one bitter), 
bruise them, and some macaroons, and when 
reduced to powder, mix them with a little 
crisped orange-flour (also in powder), and a 
suflki^fiCquantity (^powdar-sugar to sweeten 
it: add these to the above preparation, and 
stir them in well with a wooden spoon. If 
your fi^angipane be too thick, add another 
egg or two, and then make whatever use of 
it you may desire. You may, if vou think 
proper, substitute pistachios for uie sweet 
almonds, in which case a little spinach es- 
sence must be added to color it, tlie maca- 
roons and orange-flowers omitted, and three 
bitter almonds only used. 

FRENCH BEANS. Cut off the stalk 
end fii-st, and then turn to tlie point and 
strip off the strings. If not quite fresh, have 
a bowl of spring-water, with a little salt 
dissolved in it, standing before you, and as 
the beans are cleaned and stringed, throw 
them in. When all are done, put diem on 
the fire in boiling water, with some salt in 
it; afler they liave boiled fifteen or twenty 
minutes, take one out and taste it ; as soon 
as they are tender take them up; throw 
them into a colsmder or sieve to drain. To 
send up the beans whole is much the best 
method when they are thus young, and their 
delicate flavor and color are much better 
preserved. When a little more grown, they 
most be cut across in two afler stringing ; 
and for common tables they are split, ajid 
divided across ; cut them all the same length ; 
but those who are nice never have them at 
such a growth as to require splitting. When 
they are very large they k>ok pretty cut into 



FRENCH BEANS, NASTURTIUMS.

preserved, then dipped in warm water, dried 
with a cloth, and strewed all over with sift- 
ed sugar, and dried io a stove or oiven, turn- 
ing as occasion requires. 

FRUIT, CANDIED. (2) When the 
fruit is preserved, dry it in a stove till the 
sirup is quite out, dip it into simp boiled to 
candy height, and di^ it again. All dried 
and candied fruit must be kept in a very 
dry place. 

FRUrriN JELLY. Have in readmeae 
a plain mould, either long or round, about 
three inches deep; then have ready some 
mould jelly, and spread it at the IxMtoni 
of the mould, about a quarter of an inch 
thick ; let it be cold ; then put in ripe peach- 
es, grapes, or any sort of ripe fhut yoa 
please, preserved firuit, or China orangee 
cut into quarters, or whatever shape yoa 
clKXMae ; put in a little warm jelly, and let it

place, otherwise it will rise up ; then fill die 
mould up with warm jelly, let it stand tiff ft 
is quite cold, then turn it into a dish, and 
garnish it according to your own taste. 

FRUIT, PRESERVED, REMARKS 
ON USING. Preserved fruits should not be 
baked long ; those that have been preserved 
with their full |»vportion of sugar, require 
no baking; the crust should be baked in a 
tin shape, and the fruit be afterwards added ; 
or it may be put into a small dish or tart- 
pans, and the covers be baked on a tin cot 
out according to your taste. 

FRUIT, TO PREPARE FOR BrANDT. 

Take the proposed quantity of fruit, gather- 
ed before they are perfectly ripe ; dry them 
carefully, prick and put them into cold water ; 
when all in, set the vessel over a moderate 
fire, keeping the water, however, constantly 
nearly boiling, until the firuit will give to the 
touch; then tlirow them, with great care, 
into cold water again ; drain away this wa- 
ter, and add fresh ; change the water twice 
more within a quarter of an hour, after 
which, drain them for the last time, and put 
diem in bottles ; if any of the fruit is 'the 
least broken or bruised, it must be put aside, 
as it would spoil the rest. In the mean- 
while, take a proper quantity of sugar (as a 
pound and a half for twen^-five peaches) ; 
clarify and boil it to fa nappe; measure, 
and put double its quantity of good Ixandy; 
mix and pour them into a glaied pan; wt 
them stand awhile, and then poor ttie mix* 
ture on the fiiiit.

GAME. Id choosing venison, the &t of 
that which iff good is thick, clear, and bright ; 
die clift jiart mnooth and close. When the 
vai'noQ 18 perfectly fresh, it is hung in a cool 
place, and carefiilly wiped dry evefy day. 
When extreme tendemesB is required from 
long^ keeping, but without its having a high 
ftivor, it is well rubbed over with powdered 
charcoal. 

The haunch is the prime joint, and when 
it is required to be roasted, it is first well 
Dvariied in hikewarm milk-and-water, and 
then made quite dry before it is spitted. It 
is then covered with a irfieet of well-buttered 
white paper, ovor which is bid a coarse 
paste of flour-and-water, about a quarter oS 
an inch thick; this is again covered with 
buttered white paper, and tied on with pack- 
thread. A substantial fire being made, the 
haunch is put doMm, and constantly banted 
with fresh beef dripping, till nearly done, 
when the paste is taken off, the meat well 
basied with butter, and lightly dredged with 
floor, till it fi*oth8 smd becomes of a fine light 
brown cok>r. It b served with its own gra- 
vy in the dish, if there be enough of it ; also 
a sance tureen of good brown gravy, and 
one of currant jelly sauce beat up, and meh- 
ed with a little Port wine and sugar. 

A large haunch takes about fiwr hours to 



A neck and dioulder, whoi roasted, is 
manased in the same way as the haunch, 
omitting the paste ; but it is mmie frequently 
■Bed for MMip, pasties, and coUops. 

Hare. — ^Whon fresh, the body is stifl*; 
and if young, the claws are smooth and 
sharp, the ears tender and easily torn. 
Hares are kept from a week to a fortnight 
for roasting; but for soup, they cannot have 
been loo recently killed. 

Rabbits are chosen by the same rules as 



Wild fowl, in general, is diosen by the 
■ame ndes as tame poultry. The birds 
should be plump and &t, and hard in the 
vent. If the skin comes off when rubbed 
hard with the finger, they are stale. Okl 
*^' ' improve by keeping fiir sometime; 






birds are bust if draind soon* aad 
birds, of all descriptions, shouM be 
ionaiedidilely dresivd. In warm weather, a 
stopper of charcoal shouM be put into the 
vent of all game, and a string tied tightly 
round the neck. 

To roast pheasants and partrid^, they 
are picked, cleaned, and nicely singed; a 
slit is made in the back part of the neck, and 
the craw taken out, leaving on the head, the 
feet twisted cbscly to the body, tlie clawa 
cut off, and the heaid turned undier the wii^. 
Both sorts are roasted by the directiom for 
roasting a turkey or a fowl. A pheasant is 
served with gravy in the didi ; partiklgea 
with a gravy, or laid upon buttered toast, 
and melted butter poured round thetu. Bread 
sauce is served with both. A (iheasant wiU 
reouire nearly an hour to roast ; partrklgea 
half an hour. Guinea and pea-fowl are 
roosted in the same %iray as pheasants. 

To roast black-cock, follow the directions 
for roasting pheasants and partridges; it 
will require an hour, and is served with gra- 
vy in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce 
tureen. 

Moorfowl are roasted in the same manner, 
and require three-quarters of an hour. Thej

two pounds of steaks; put them into a 
stewpan, with a bottle of white wine; boil 
tbem until the whole is entirely reduced to 
a jelly ; then add to it broth, and consomme, 
(equal quantities of each), eight carrots, ten 
onions, three cloves, a little Uiyme and ba- 
sil ; let the whole boil very gently, until the 
meat is quite done; then strain it through a 
Bapkiii. No salt need be put into it, as die 
hcoth and consomme ai« sufficiently season- 
ed to flavor the essence*of game.

GATEAU DE COMPIEGNE. TsAe 
three pounds of flour, two pounds of butter, 
an ounce and four drachms of yeast, an 
ounce of salt, a quarter of a pound of sugar, 
a glass of cream, twelve yolks and twdve 
whole eggs, and five or six spoonfiils of 
whipped cream. 

Widi tliese ingredients proceed as fiiliows: 
sift the flour, of which put a fourth psu't on 
the slab, make a hole in the middle, put into 
it a glass of warm water and the yeast ; mix 
them together as lightly, and with as much 
despatch as possible, sidding more waim 
water if necessary ; when well worked im 
for some minutes, gaUier it together, (it 
ought to leave die slab and the hand free^); 
put it into a saucepan ; cover it, and pacs 
it in a tolerably warm situation to rise. 
Take the rest of the flour, lay it on the 8]aA» 
make a hole in the middle of it, in which 
put the salt, sugar, and cream ; stir these 
together well, and then put in the eg;^, one 
at a time, (break them into a basin, m case 
all shoukl not be good) ; the eggs being pot 
in, add by degrees the butter, stirring them 
well; then mix the flour, a little at a time, 
with the above, until tl» whole is formed 
into a smooth paste; more ^gs nuist be 
added if it be too stiff; work it up a iittl^ 
and then add the leaven ; work that in ; and 
lastly, put in the whipped cream. Tha 
whole operation being thus pedbrmed, have 
ready a cylindrical fluted mould, (abont 
eight inches in diameter, and nine in height); 
butter it by means of a sponge, being care* 
fill that it IS done in all parts, otherwise the 
gateau will adhere to it; place the moidd 
in a moderate^ warm place, but whore 
Uiere is a free current of air. When the gth 
teau has risen so as to fill the mould, and 
the sur&ce is a little inflated, it ehoold be 
pit into dbe oven instantly, if not, it &lis and 
becomes heavy. The oven must be of a 
moderate heat, and kept closed while the

GINGERBREAD, LAFAYETTE. 

Five eggs ; ludf a pound of brown sugar ; half 
a pound of fresh butter ; a pint of sngar^house 
molasses; a pound and a half offluur; four 
table-spoonfuls of ginger; two large sticks of 
cinnamon ; three dozen grains of allspice ; 
three dozen of cloves ; the juice and grated 
peel of two lemons. Stir the butter and su- 
gar to a cream ; beat the e^gs very well ; 
pour the molasses at once, into the butter 
and stigai'. Add the ginger and other spice, 
and stir ail well together. Put in the egg 
and flour alternately, stirring all the time. 
Stir the whole very hard, and put in the 
lemon at the last. When the whole is mix- 
ed, stir it till very light. Butter an earthen

gingerbread in it. Bake it in a modei'ate 
oven, an hour or more, according to its 
thickness. Take care that it do not burn.

tle tins. Its lightness will be much improv- 
ed by a small tea-spoonful of pearlash dis- 
solved in a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and stir- 
red lightly in at the last. Too much pearl- 
ash will give it an unpleasant taste. If you 
use pearlash, you must omit the lemon, as 
its taste will be entirelv destroyed by the 
pearlash. You may substitute for the lem- 
on some raisins and currants, well floui^ 
tp prevent their sinking.

fresh the feet are pliable ; if stale they are 
dry and stiff. Green seese are in seaaoii 
fivm May or June, till uiey are three months 
oM; they should be scalded. A stubble 
goose is good till it is five or six months 
old, and should be picked dry. 

GOOSE ROASTED. A stubble ^wm 
should be studfed with sage and onions, 
chopped small, and mixed with pepper and 
salt ; boil the sage and onion in a little wa- 
ter before they are chopped, or mix a few 
bread crumbs with them when chopped;

sieve ; allow rather more dian hidf fks 
weight of the pulp of pounded kMif sngar, 
mix it togetlier, and boil it till it will jdly, 
which will take almost two hoars; stir, and 
skim it, then put it into a disli, and serve 
when cold, to be eaten with cream. The 
thin juice may be boiled widi its weight of 
good brown sugar, and used as goosebeny 
jelly. 

GOURDS FRIED. (1) Cut fiw or ss 
gourds in qusuters ; take off the skin aad 
pulp; stew them in the same manner as fisr 
table: when done, drain them quite dr^; 
beat up 'an e^, and dip the gointls in it, 
and cover them well over with braad-cnmrfis; 
make some hog*s-lard hot, and fry them a 
nice light color; dirow a little sak aad 
pepper over them, and serve up quite dry. 

GOURDS FRIED. (2) Take six er 
eight small gourds, as near of a size as pos- 
sible; slice them with a cucumber-slice; 
dry them in a cloth, and then fry them in 
very hot lard ; dirow over a little pepper and 
salt, and serve up on a napkin. Great at- 
tention is requisite to do these well ; if the 
(at is quite hot they are done in a minute, 
and will soon spoil ; if not hot enough, they 
will eat greasy and tough. 

GOURDS STEWED. Take off dl 
the skin of six or eight gourds, put them in- 
to a stewpan, with water, sah, lemon-juice, 
and a bit of butter, or ^t bacon, and let 
them stew gently till quite tender, and serte 
up with a rich Dutch sauce, or any other 
sauce you please that is piqwtnie. 



GRAPES, COMPOTE. Boil a ( 
of a pound of sugar witli half a glass of wa- 
ter, till it is reduced to a strons simp ; skim, 
and then put into it a pound of grapes, pidt- 
ed from the stalks, and the seeds taken out; 
give them a boil two or three times, and 
then place them in a dessert dish: if thnv is 
any scum upon them, carefiiUy wipe it off 
with white paper. 

GRAPES, PICKLED. The grapes 
must be at their full growth, but not ripe, 
cut them in small bunches ; put them in a 
stone jar, with vine leaves between each 
layer of grapes, till the jar is fiill ; then take 
as* much spnng-water as will cover the 
grapes and the leaves ; as it heats piit in as 
much salt as will make a brine sii^k^iendv

GRAVY. (1) Take dufw pomda of beef 
steaks, two rabbits, (exoepUng the beads 
and breasts), a knuckle of ««al, five carrots, 
six onions, two cbves, two bay leavm, a 
bunch of parsley and scallions; put all tiMM 
into a stewpan, wiUi two kuUesnd of broth, 
and set them over a good fire to reduce; 
dien cover the stove, and let the stewpan 
stand over it, until the meat begins to give 
out the gravy, and adheres sliglitly ; the jel- 
ly at the bottom of the stewpan oucht to be 
nearl;^ black, and when that is the case, 
take it from tbe stove, and let it stand for 
ten minutes; then fill up the stewpan with 
good broth, or water, (if the kuter, not so 
large a Quantity) ; kit this simmer for three 
hours; akim and aeason it well. If water 
is used instead of broth, the gravy must be 
strained before it is uwd. Gravy may also 
be ms^ of any pieces of ready dressed 
meat, in tbe following manner: cut some 
onions into sUoes, lay than at the bottom of 
tlie stewpan, and the meat on them, with 
the same ingredients as above, and two or 
Uiree glasses of water ; then proceed in tha 
same manner as the other, until the bottom 
of the stewpan is nearly black, when add 
water according to the quantity of meat; 
put salt if necessai^, and simmer the whole 
for two hours; then strain it through a 
sieve. 

GRAVY. (2) Cut down into slices foar 
pounds of lean beef, rub the bottom of the 
pot with butter, and put in the meat; turn it 
fraquendv till it be vrall browned, and do it 
sbwly, then add foiir quarts of cold water; 
when it has boiled two hours, put in two 
dessertHspoonfuls of whole pepper, one caiv 
rot, and three onions ; let it stew gentlj^ for 
four hours longer, strain it, and when it is 
required for use, take off the fot. Hiis gra- 
vy answers for all made dishes when brown 
gravy sauce isused. 

GRAVY AND STUFFING FOR 
DUCKS. BoUaU die giblets exoeptinfc die 
liver for an hour in a pint of water with a 
chopgped onion, some sab and pepper; strain, 
and add a very little browning, with a tea- 
spoonfol of ooratch, and one of mushroom 
ketchup; for the stuffing, mince the raw 
liver with two sage leaves, a small onion, 
some pepper and salt, a knt of butter, and 
grated bread crumbs. 

Send your sauces to table aa hot as poa- 
sible. 

Nothinff can be more unsightly than tha 
surfoce of a sauce in a frozen state, or gar- 
nished with grease on the top. The best 
way to get rid of this, is to pass it through

Utp'knot of COOKERY is, to entertain the 
mouth without oflending the stomach. 

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. It is of 
as much importance that die cook shddd 
know how to make a himt of good gravy for 
poultry} &cj as that it shoirid oe sent up of 
proper complexion, and nioriy frothed. 

We shall endeavor to introdnoe lo her all 
the materials which give flavor in »auee 
which is the eatenee ofaoupi and intended 
to contain more relish in a Ua-spoonfiU 
than the former does in a table-apoonfiJ, 

We hope to deserve as mteb praise from 
the 0e<mom«sfa8Wedofromthe6<m«MMm<; 
as we have taken great pains ttf introduce to 
him tlie methods of midiing Sufaetitntes for 
tfaoee ingredients, which are always expen- 
sive, and often not to be had at all. Many 
of these cheap articles are as savory ami 
as salutary as the dearer ones, and those who 
have lai^ fomiliesand limited incomes, will, 
no doubt, be glud to avail themselves of 
them. 

The reader may rest assured, that wlieth- 
er he consults this book to diminish the ex- 
pense or imrease the pleasures of hospitality, 
he will find all the information tliat was to 
be obtained up to 1882, ccMnmunicated in 
the most unreserved and intelligible manner. 

A great deal of the elegance of cookery 
depends upon the accompaniments to each 
diih being appropriate and well adapted 
to it. 

We can ttssure our readers, no attention 
has been wanting on oar part to render this 
department of the woiii worthy of their pe- 
rusal ; each receipt is the fiutraul narrative 
of actual and repeated experiments, and has 
reoeiv^ die most deliberate consideration 
before it was here presented to them. Itis 
given in the most circumstantial manner, 
and not in the technical smd mysterious Ian- 
gimge former writ«« on these subjects seem 
to luive prefened ) by which their directions 
are useless and miintell^ble to all who have 
not regularly serted an apprenticei^ip at the 
stove. 

It win be to very little purpose that I 
have taken so much pains to teach how to 
manage roasts and boils, if a cook cannot or 
will not make die several sauces that are 
lUy sent up with them. 

We have, therefore, endeavored to give 



the plainest directions hovr to produce, imai 
the least trouble and expense possible, all 
the various compositions the English kitdieo 
affords ; and hope to present sodi a whole- 
some and palatable variety as will suit all 
tastes and all pockets, so that a cook may 
give satisfiiction in all fiimiliesi The more 
combinations of this sort she is acquainted 
with, the better she will comprdieDd the 
managemmit of every one of them. 

Let your sauces each display a decided 
character; sand up your plain sauces (oys- 
ter, lobster, &c.) as pure as possible: they 
should only taste of the materials from wliicfa 
th^ take their name. 

The imagination of most cooks is so in- 
cessantly on the hunt for a reKsli, that they 
seem to think they cannot make sauce stiffi- 
ciently savory wittiout putting into it every- 
thing that ever was eaten; and supposing 
every addition must beanimpro^'ement, they 
frequently overpower the natural flavor of 
their plain sauces, by overloading thm 
with salt and spices, &c. : but, remember, 
these will be deteriorated by any addition, 
save only just salt enough to awaken the 
palate. 

On the contrary, of COMPOVKD savcss; 
the ingredients should be so nicf^ly propor- 
tioned, that no one be (Mnedominant ; so thtt 
from the equal union of the combined fit- 
vors such a fine mellow mixture is produced, 
whose very novelty cannot foil of being ac- 
ceptable to the persevering gowrmand, if it 
hais not pretensions to a permanent place at 
his table. 

An ingenious cook will form as endless a 
variety of these compositions us a mtisteum 
with his seven notes, or a petinter with hin 
colors; no part of her business ofliers so fiiir 
and frequent an opportunity to display her 
abilities: spices, herbs, &c. are oAa 
very absurdly and injudiciously jumbled to- 
gether. 

Why have dove and allspice, or mace and 
nutm^, in the same sauce; or marjoram, 
thyme, and savory; or cmions, leeks, es- 
chalots, and garlici one will very well si^ 
ply the place of the other, and die fitigal 
cook mi^ save something considerable by 
attending to this, to the advantage fk her 
employa:^, and her own time and troiMe.

The fiillowinff receipt was given us by a 
very good cook: — ^You may make good 
tNniwniag for roast meat and poultiy, bv 
saving the brown bits of roast meat or nail-

cover them with boiling water, and put them

roast meat, put two table*spo<Nifuls mto half 
a pint of boiling water witli a little salt: if 
for roasted veal, put three tablenEipoonfuls 
into half a pint of thin melted butter.

move it, baste and froth the meat, and pour 
the gravy into the dish on which the roast is 
to be served. 

GRAVY MADE FROM BONES. 

Break into small pieces a pound of beef, 
mutton, or veal bones, if mixed together so 
much the better ; boil them in two quarts of 



it bails, kt K 
nearly three hoars : boil with it a couple «f 
onions, a bunch of tweet herbs, some salt 
and pepper; strain, and keep it for making 
gravy or sauees. The bones of broiled and 
roasted meat being scraped, washed clean, 
and boiled in less waler, wnsaiw equally well 
for this purpose. 

GRAVY MADE WITHOUT MEAT. 

(1) Slice three onaona, and fiy them brown 
in a little butter; add them to half a pint

herbs, and a quarter of a slice of bread 
toasted brown on both sides ; simmer all to- 
gether in a closely covered saucepan for 
twenty minutes, llien strain it for use, and 
when cold take off the fiit. It wiU taste 
exactly like a gravy made with meat.

pan to the side of the firo, skim it, and let 
It boil ^ntly a second time, and if any scum

Have ready in a stewpan, a pint of hHl*

the oatmeal you have mixed ; return it into 
the stewpan ; set it on the fire, and let it 
boil for five minutes; stirring it all the time 
to prevent the oatmeal fix>m burning at the 
bottom of tiie stewpan; skim and strain k 
through a hair sieve.

little ale, wine, or In^ndy, with sugar; and 
if tlie boweb are disordered, a little nutmeg 
or ginger, grated.

stead of water ; and may lie flavored with 
sweet herbs, soup roots, and savory ^ioes, 
by boiling them for a few minutes in tlie 
water you are going to make the gnie] with. 



H. 



HAM. If it is a very diy Westphslis 
ham, it must be soaked, according to its age 
and thickness, from twelve to twenty-te 
hours ; for a green ham, from four to eight 
hours will be sufficient. Lukewarm water will 
soften it much sooner than cold, wlien suffi- 
ciently soaked, trim it nicely on the under- 
side, and pare off all the rusty and smoked 
parts till it kwks delicately clean. 

Give it plenty of water-room, and put k 
in while the water is cold; let it beiU veiy 
gradually, and let it be on the fire an hour 
and a haU* before it comes to a boil ; let it 
be well skimmed, and keep it simmering 
very gently: a middlingHBized ham of fifteen 
pouiiOB will be done enough in about Sum or 
five hours, according to its thickness. 

If not to be cut till cokl, it will cut the 
shorter and tenderer for being boiled aboitf 
half an hour longer. In a vei^ smaH family, 
where a ham will last a week or ten days, 
it is best economy not to cut it till it is cold, 
it will be infinitely more juicy. 

Pull off the skin carefully, and preserve it 
as whole as possible; it will fonn an exod> 
lent covering to keep the ham moist; when 
you have removed tlie skin, rub some bread 
raspings through a hair sieve, or grate a 
crust of bread; put it into tlie perforaied 
cover of the dr^gii^-box, and shake it over

HAM, ESSENCE OF. Take three or 
four pounds of lean ham, cut it into pieces 
dxMit an inch thick, and lay them in a stew- 
pOB, with slices of carrots, parmipe, and 
three or four onions ; let them stew till they 
fldck to the pan, but take care they do not

HAM GRAVY. Take a deep sance- 
pan, put into it a piece of frarii butter, seve- 
ral slices of ham, about six pieces of veal 
the sixe of a walnut, and two or three car- 
rots cat in small pieces; set these over a 
dow fire, and let them stand till they give 
out their juices, and tlie ham and veal be- 
come crisp and stick; then put in a little 
8tc»ck, and let it boil; in an hour's time add 
a glass of white wine, leave it a quarter of 
an hour, when it will be sufficiently done; 
lake off every particle of &t; strain it into 
a pan, and set it by for use. 

HAM LOAF. Soak a fine ham in cold 
water for one or two days, according to its 
age; then put it into a saucepan just big 
enougli to hold it, with no more water than 
will cover it, and a pint of white wine ; let 
it Ixjil, skimming it carefully, till done. 
When cold, take out the hock and under 
bones, and the skin ; pare away some of the 
£it, and trim it to an oval form as much as 
possible. Make a farce with the parmgs of 
the fat, some veal or game, and sweet herbs 
minced and pounded. Take a pan the size 
^rou wish to have your loaf, lay all over the 
inside a pretty firm paste, and then (hav- 
ing cut your ham into thin slices) place al- 
ternate layers of it and the &rce in tlie pan, 
until it be quite foil. Put a cnist over the 
top, which most unite with that in which 
the ham is ; turn it over on a baking plate, 
floor it, and put it into a very hot oven for 
an boor and a half or two hours, according 
to its stzev Serve it cold.

it with adoaen aggs beaten with a little veal 
gravy; fry it (keeping it of an etfval thick- 
») is the vsnal WMoer. 



HAM, OR TONGUE POTTED. Ort 
a pound of the lean of ookl boiled ham or 
tongue, and pound it in a mortar with a 
quarter of a pound of the fat, or with finesh 
butter (in the praportmn of about two ounoea 
to a pound), till it is a fine paste (some sea- 
son it hy d^rees with a little pounded mace 
or allspice): put itckise down ir pots fbr 
that purpose, and cover it with clarified 
butter, a quarter of an inch thick ; let it 
stand one night in a cool place. Send it 
up in the pot, or cut out in &ia slices. 

HAM ROASTED WITH MADEIRA. 

Take a fine Westphalia or Bayonne haa, 
pare and trim it of as round a form tis possi- 
ble, take off the end bone, and remi>ve 
the rind from die knuckle; then lay die ham 
on a gridiron over the fire, till you can take 
it up with ease; soak it, if necessary, and 
pot it in a pan, with slices of carrots and 
onions, thyme, ba^-leaf, and coriander ; pour 
a bottle of Madeira upon it, cover it with a 
clean clofh, and close the pan as tight a« 
possible, and let it remain twvnfy-four hours; 
then wrap the ham in very thick paper, fiis- 
ten it with paste, so that it may be com- 
pletely enclosed, tie it on a spit, ar^i put 
it to roast fur three hours; then make a 
small hole in the paper, and poor in, by 
means of a fimnel, tlie Madeira wine, paste 
paper over the liole, and let it roast another 
hour. When done, take off the paper care- 
fully, so that none of the gravy may escape^ 
mix it with some reduced etpagnole, glaze 
the ham, and ser^'e it. 

HAM TOAST. Cut some crumb of 
bread into thin slices ; then take an equal 
number of thin slices of ham, beat them well 
with a rollins pin, and then soak them in 
warm water for about two hours ; take them 
om, dry them well, and put them into a 
saucepan with a little bacon, a slice of veal^ 
and half a glass of stock ; let them boil for 
half an hour, and then add half a glass of 
veaP blond, Fiy your bi*ead to a nice col- 
or in some lard ; lav it on a dish, and on eadi 
piece lay a slice ot the ham ; pour the sauce 
over them. Take particular care to cut 
the ham as nearly as possible the size and 
shs^of tlie bread. 

HAM TO STEW. Soak the ham m 
lukewarm water fiw twelve hours, drain it, 
and scrape the rind ; put it mto a stewpan

wine. Cover the ham with slioee of fot ba- 
oon, and put over it a eheet of white paper; 
atew it eight hours, or ten if it be a veiy 
large ham. Before flen'iii|^, take off the 
rind, mrain the Buwe, skim it well, and 
boil it till reduced to a ghae, and pour it 
round the ham, or serve it with anjr other 
aauoe that may be preferred. 

HAM WITH MADEIRA. Soak in 
water fw two hours a Bayonne, or any other 
fine ham, boil it for two hours, trim it quick- 
Iv, and tlien put it into a stewpan, with thin 
aiioes of veal at the bottom ; add some car- 
rots and parsley, and season with qiioes. 
Pour over the ham a pint of rich stock and 
a bottle of Madeira ; let it boil for two hours, 
strain and skim the fat off the sauce, 
which, with the ham, must be served quite 
hot. 

HARE. As soon as the otxk receives a 
iiare, she should take out the liver, &c., wipe 
it well, put in a little pepper, and bang it 
up. When wanted (or dressing, cut off 
the four 1^ at the first joint, raise the 
ricin of the back, and draw it over the 
hind legs ; leave the tail whole, then draw 
the dcin ovir the back, and slip out the four 
legs ; cut it fi'om the neck and head ; skin 
the ears, and leave them on. Clean the 
ivent. Cut the unews under the hind legs ; 
iN-ing thfem forward ; ran a skewer through 
jone hind leg, the body, and another hind 
leg ;ylo the same with die fore legs^ lay the 
h^a rather back ; put a' skewer in at the

the paste, rab it quickly over with egg, 
sprinkle bread-crumbs, and baste it gently 
with butler ^still keeping it turning before 
the fire) until a crust is formed over it and 
it is of a nice brown color; dish it over 
some e^pagnole with Madeira wine boiled 
in it ; two or three cloves may be stuck into 
the knuckles if you think proper. 

HASHED HARE. Cut up the hare 
into pieces fit to help at table, and divide 
the jotntB of the 1^ and shoulders, and set 
them by ready, rut the trimmings and 
gravy you have left, with half a pint of wa- 
t«r (there should be a pint of lii^uor), and a 
tabloHspoonfol of ciorant jelhr, uito a clean 
stewpan, and let it boil gently for a quarter 
of an hour: then strain it through a siete 
into a basin, and pour it back into the slew- 
pan; now flour the hare, put it into the 
pfravy, and let it simmer very gently till the 
hare is warm (about twenty minutes) ; cut 
the stuffing into slices, and put it into the 
hash to get warm, about five minutes before 
vou serve it ; divide the head, and lay one 
half on each side the dish. 

HARICJOT BY WAY OF SOUP. 
Cut a large neck of mutton into two pieces, 
put the scrag into a stewpan with a quart 
of water, four large carrotB, and turnips; 
boil it gently over a slow fire tiU all the 
goodness be out of the meat; then bruise 
the vegetables into the soup to thicken it. 
Fry six onions (sliced) in butter, and pot 
the other part of die meat to the soup, and 
stew till the latter is tender; seaacm widi 
pepper and salt, and serve it very hot in a 
tureen. 

HARICOT MUTTON. Cut the best 
end of a neck or loin of noutton, that 
has been kept till tender, into cfac^ of 
equal thickness, one rib to each ; trim off 
some of the fot, and the lower end of the 
chine bone, and scrape it clean, and lay 
them in a stewpan, with an ounce of butter; 
set it over a smart fire; if your fire is not 
sharp, the chops will be done before thqr 
are colored; the intention of firying themv 
merely to give them a very light browning. 

While Uie chops are browning, peel and 
boil a couple of dozen of younz button onioBi 
in about three pints of water for about fiAefli 
or twenty minutes, set them by, and poor off

into halls about as big as a nutmeg; boil 
the carrots about lialf an hour, the turnips 
about a quarter of an Iraur, and put them on 
a sieve to drain, and then put them round 
the dish, the last thing. 

Thicken tlie gravy by putting an ounce of

HASH, COLD. Mince a nice white 
piece of veal, wash and core some anchovies ; 
take some pickled oysters, pickled cucum- 
bers, and a lemon; shred and mix them 
with the veal, and place it in a dish ; lay 
round it slices of veal, fillets of anchovies, 
pickled cucumbers sliced, wliole pickled

then to be filled up with French brandy, 
and albwed to stand two or three nonthsy 
when it must be decanted off, and sweetened 
with clarified sugar, or with capillaire. 
Without the sweetening, it is an excellent 
seasoning fiir puddings and costards. 

HEDGEHOG TO MAKE. Bkncb 
two pounds of sweet almoods, beat them to 
a paste in a mortar, moistening oooasionally 
witli Canary andorange-fiowcr water ; beat 
the yolks of twelve, ami the whites of seven 
eggs with a piht of cream and some powder 
sugar; put this with the ahnond paste and 
half a pound of firesh butter inloa saucepan, 
set it over a stove and keep it constantly 
stiiring till sufficiently firm to be moulded 
into the shape of a hedgehog: stick it full 
of blanched almonds, cut lengthwise, into 
slips, and place it in a dish; beat up the 
yolks of four eggs, put them to a pint of 
cream (sweetened to tlie taste) ; stir then 
over a slow fire till hot, then pour it round 
die hedgehog and let it stand: when cold, 
serve it. A good calf 's-foot jelly may ba 
poured round, instead of the cream, if pre- 
ferred.

who are not in the constant habit of attend- 
ing the markets to know when the various 
seasons commence for purchasing sweet 
herbs. 

All vegetables are m the highest state 
of perfection, and fulkst of juice and flavor,

Take cam they ara gathered oa a diy 
day, by which neaaB th^ will have a bet- 
ter color when dried. CleaDBe your herba 
well fi-om dirt and duat; cut oflf the roots; 
aeparate the bunches into siaaller ones, and 
diy them by the heat of a'llove, or in a 
Dutch ovea before a ooibbmni fire, m such 
quantities at a time, that the prooese may be 
speedity finished; s. e, *Kill *em quick,* 
says a great botanist; by this means their 
flavor wiH be best preserved: there can be 
ao doubt of the propriety of drying herbs, 
&c. hastily by the aid of artificial heat, 
noher than by the heat of the sun. In the 
application of artificial heat, the only cau- 
tion requisite is to avoid btuming ; luid of 
this a sufficient test is albrded l^ the pres- 
ervation of the color. The common cus- 
tom is, when they are perfectly dried to put 
tiiem in bags, ancl lay them in a drv place; 
but the be^ way to preserve the invor of 
aromatic plants is to pick oiF die leaves as 
soon as th^ are dried, and to pound them, 
and pot theui through a hair sieve, and keep 
them in wellnstopped bottles. The common 
csustoifi is to put than into paper bags, and 
lay them oa a shetf in die kitchen, exposed 
to all the fumes, steam, and smdke, &c. : 
thus they soon lose their flavor. 

N. B. Herbs aicely dried are a very ac- 
ceptable si^tiCnte when fierii ones cannot 
be got; but, however carefiitty dried, die

HERRINGS. There are diree sorts of 
herrings, fresh, salted, and dried or red her- 
rings. Tliey are emptied and cleaped like 
any other fish ; when fireih, they are broiled, 
and served with mekad butter, white sauce, 
&c. 

The salted herring should be soaked m 
ookl water befinre it is cooked; thb is also 
broiled; sometimes, however, it is cat in 
pieces, and eaten raw. 

The red herring is split down die back, 
the head and tail are cut off, imd the fish 
broiled like the others. 

They may also be dressed as Ibllows: 
when tliey liave lain in cold water a soffi- 
cieat time, soak them ht two hours in milk, 
then split them down the back ; then have 
nady some melted butter, in which has been 
mixed basil and bay-leaf, minced email, the 
yolks of two ^gs, pepper and nntm^ ; rub 
' the herrings well with this, bread them ; 
broil them over a gentle fire, and serve with 
lemon-juice. 

The best red herrings are fiiU of roe, 
are film and lai^, and have a yellow 



if good, the eves are fcO, and the gifti m^

HERRINGS, BOILED. Scafe, and 
otherwise prepare the herrings in the obbbI 
way ; diy them well, and tub them over with 
a little salt and viaemr; skevrer thrir tafls

the jar a piece of bladder w paper, sad 
bake them in an oven ibr an hour. Take

HERRINGS TO FRY. Scrape off 
die scales; cut off the fins; draw out the 
gut, keeping in the roes and mdls; wipe 
them HI a clean cloth; diedge diem widi 
flour, and fiy them in boiling driming; put 
diem before the fire to drain and keep hoC 
Sauces;— melted butter, and parsl^ and 
butler. When herrii^ are to be broiled, 
they are (Mepared in the same manner, and 
done upon the gridiron. They must not be 
washed. 

HIPPOCRAS. Take one ounce of 
cinnamon, two diwdmis of ginger, two pen- 
ny-weights of cloves, nutmeg, and galragal 
a penny-weight of each. Pound these to- 
gether well, and infine them in a pint of red

Then turn it out. Boil the liquor it was 
dreaeed in with some vinegar, akim it well, 
and when cold put the heM. into it. 

HONEY TO CLARIFY— M, Fou- 
q,ux'8 HXTHOD. Take six pounds of 
hooey, a pound and three-quartera of water, 
two ounces and a quarter of pounded chalk, 
five ounces of coal, (pulverised, washed, and 
well dried)^ the whites of three eggs beaten 
in thfee ounces of water, for each pound of 
honey. 

Put the honey, water, chalk, and egp, 
into a copper vessel, capable of holding 
about (Mie-third more than the above quanti- 
ties ; let than boil for two minutes, throw 
in the coal, mixing it with a spoon, and 
continue the boiling two minutes longer; 
then take the saucepan from the fire, and 
Jet it stand nearly a quarter of an hour, that 
die liquor may cool ; then take a new sieve 
(which must be well washed, or it will un- 
part a disagreeable taste), pass the honey 
tfarou^ it, taking ca^re to filter the first 
drops twice, as they generally carry with 
them some portion of dbe coal. 

The sin^ which still adheres to the coal, 
and other materials, may be separated as 
ioUowa: pour boiling water on th^n until 
diey no longo: retain any sweetness; thai 
put these dioerent waters together, set them 
over a lar&e fire to evaporate, till the sirup 
<mly remams. This sirup contracts the fla- 
vor of barlev sugar, and must not be added 
to the darined honey. 

HORSERADISH POWDER. The 
time to make this is during November and 
December ; slice it the thickness of a shil- 
ling, and lay it to diy very gradually in a 
Dutch oven (a strong beat soon evaporates 
its flavor) ; when dry enough, pound it and 
bottle it. 

HOT PIC^KLE. Boil, m two quarts of 
vinegar, a quarter of a pound of salt, two 
ounces of shallots or garhc, and two of gin- 
^, one ounce of pepper, one c^ yellow mus- 
tard seed, and a quarter of an ounce of 
cayome; put into a jar that will hold four 
quarts, two ounces of allspice, and pour on 
It the hot pickle. When cold, put in any 
frodi-eathered vegetables or fruit, such as 
asparagus, cauliflower, French beains, radish

lOE. SoibetieKs or mooUs for 
or fiiiit-ioes, are made of two sorts of ma- 
terials, block-tin and pewter; of these, the' 
latter is the best, the substenoe to be iced 
congealing OMxre gradually in it than ia the 
former ; an olqect moch to be desired, as 
when the ice is formed too <]piicUy, it is vcrv 
apt to be rough, and fiiU of lumps like hail, 
especialty if it be not well w<Miied with the 
spatula ; the other utensils necessary for this 
operati<Hi, are, a deep pail, with a omrk at 
the bottom, and a wooden spatula aboot 
nine inches long; beii^ so for provided, till 
the pail with powided ice, over which spread 
four handfols of salt; then having filled the 
sorbetiere, or mould, with cream, &c. ; pot 
on the cover, and immerse it in the oentre 
of the ice-fiail; taking care the ice touches 
the mould in all parts ; throw in two more 
liandfuls of salt, and Imve it a quarter of an 
hour; then take the cover firom the mould, 
and with the spatula stir the contmits up to- 
gether, so that those parts which touch the 
sides of the mould, and co n s e qu e ntly coogeal 
first, may be mixed with the liquid in the 
middle; work this about for seven or eiebt 
minutes; cover the modd, take the pail l)y 
the ears, and shake it round and round toe 
a quarter of an hour ; open the mould a sec- 
ond time, and stir as before; continue these 
operations alternately, until the cream, w 
whatever it may be, is entirely oonfleaJed, 
and perfectly smooth, and free finom lumps. 
Take care to let out the water, which will 
collect at the bottom of the pail, by means 
of the cork, and press the ice close to the 
sorbetiere with the spatula. 

When the cream is iced, take it Seom the 
pail, dip the mould in warm water, hot not 
to let it remain an instant; dry it quickly, 
turn it out, and serve it as soon as possibw. 

All sorts of ices are finished in this man- 
ner; the preparation of the articles of which 
they are composed, constitutes the only dif- 
feroioe between them. 

ICX:, A VERY LARGE CAKE. Beat 
the whites of twenty fi«sh eras; then, fay 
degrees, beat a pound <^ doame-refined su- 
gar, sifted through a lawn sieve; mix thsM 
well in a deep earthen pan; add orange- 
flower water, and a piece of finesfa lemon- 
peel; do not use more of the oranse-flower

ICE FOR ICING (HOW to fbk- 
PARE). Take a few poands of ioe, break 
H almost to powder, aod throw in among it 
a large handful and a half of salt; you must 
prepare in the oookat part of the house, that 
as little of the warm air as possible may 
come. The ice and salt being in a bucket, 
nit your cream into an ice-pot, and cover it ; 
immerse it in the ice, and draw that round 
the pot, so that it may touch every part. In 
a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and 
stir it well, removii^ the parts that ice round 
the edges to the centre. If the ice-cream or 
water, be in a (brro, shut the bottom close, 
and move the whole in the ice, as you can- 
not use a spoon to that without danger of 
waste. There shouk) be hokis in the ouck- 
et, to let the ice off as it thaws. 

ICING FOR CAKES. For a kirge 
cake, beat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar, 
pot it into a mortar, with four spoonfuls of 
rose water, and the whites of two e^, 
beaten and strained, whisk it well, and 
when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather 
in the icing, and cover the cake well; set it 
in the oven to harden, but do not let it re- 
main long enough to discolor. Keep the

Joins; two pounds of potatoes; peel them, 
and cot them in halves ; six onions, or half 
a pound of onions ; peel and slice them also :

crayy^and two tea-spoonfiils of mushroom 
ftetcbup; cover all very dose in, so as to 
prevent the steam from getting out, and let 
thorn stew for an hour and a half on a very 
dow fire. A small slice of bam is a great 
addition to this dish. The cook will be the 
best judge when it is done, as a great deal 
depends on the fire you have. Great care 
must be taken not to let it bqm, and that it 
does not do too fest 

ISINGLASS, TO CI.ARIFY. Take 
an ounce and auarter of the best isingfass, 
cut it into small pieces, and wash them sev- 
eral times in warm water. Put the isinglass 
into a preserving pan, with five glasses of 
filtered water, set it on the fire, am, as soon 
as it boils, place it at the side of the stove, 
w Ml to keep up the boiiing; take off the 



scon direetly it rises; and when the wholft 
is lednoed lo thre»4|UBnen, strain it throaiii 
a cloth into a basin for use. Some add, m 
clarifying isinghss, lemon-peel, to remove 
its disagreeable taste; but as good isinglaM 
'ought to have no flavor, and as the lemoii- 
peel is certain to give a yellow tinge to that. 
It is much better wfk out. 

ITALIAN CHEESE. Mn with near- 
ly half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, Ae 
juice of three lonons, two taUe^poonfhlB

pound of Valentia or Jordan almonds, bkmch- 
ed, pound them quite fine with the whites 
of four eggs; add two pounds and a half of 
sifted loaf sugar, and rub them welt togeth- 
er with the pestle; put in by degrees about 
ten or eleven more whites, working thea 
well as you put them in ; but the best crite- 
rion to go by in trying their lightness is to 
bake one or two, and if you find them heavy, 
put one or two more whites ; put the mix- 
ture into a biscuit-funnel, and lay them out 
on wafer-paper, in pieces about the size of a 
' small walnut, having ready about two ounces 
of blanched and dry almonds cut into slips, 
put tlu'ee or four pieces on each, and bake 
tliem on wires, or a baking-plate, in a slow 
oven. Ofrs.— Almonds should be blanched 
and dried gradually two or three days be- 
fore they are used, by which means they 
will work much better, and where large 
Quantities are used, it is advised to grind 
them in a mill provided for that purpose.

iCL 



wbeo the liquor boils, skim it well, and let 
it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may 
be rediKeil to about t«vo quarts ; then strain 
it througli a sieve, and skim off all the oily 
suhstanoe which is on the sur^use of the 
liquor. 

If you are not in a hurry, it b better to 
boil tbe calf *s feet the day before you make 
the jelly; as when the liquor is cold, the 
oily part being at the top, and the other be* 
ing nrm, with pieces (^Kitchen paper appli- 
ed to it, you may remove every particle of 
the oily substance, without wastmg any of 
tbe liquor. 

Put tlie liquor in a stewpan to melt, with 
a pound of lump sugar, the peel of two lem- 
ons, the juice of six, six whites and sliells of 
2g8 beat together, and a bottle of Sherry or 
adeira ; whisk the whole together until it is 
on the boil ; then pot it by the side of the 
stove, and let it simmer a quarter of an 
hour; strain it through a jelly-bag: what is 
strained first must be poured into the bag 
again, until it is as bright and as clear as 
rwk-water; then put the jelly in moulds, to 
be cold smd firm : if the weather is too waim, 
it requires some ice. 

When it is wished to be very stiff, half an 
otmoe of isinglass may be added when tbe 
wine is put in. 

It may be flavored by tlie juice of various 
firuits, spices, &c. and colored witli saf- 
fipoa, cochineal, red beet juice, spinage juice, 
daret, &c. ; and it is sometimes made with 
cherry brandy, w noyeau rouge, or Curacoa, 
or essence of pimch, instead of wine. 

JELLY, CALF'S FEET. (2) Take 
the fiit and bones firom eight feet, and soak 
them in water fer three or four hours; 
then boil tliem in six quarts o{ water, slcim- 
ming often; when reduced to a third, strain 
and set it by to cool ; when cold, take every 
particle of fet from the top, and remove 
whatever may have settled at die bottom. 
dissolve it in an earthen pan, adding to it 
two quarts of white wine, mace, cinnamon, 
and ginger, or not, as you please. Beat up 
the whiles of twelve eggi with three pounds 
of fine ausar, mix these with the jelly, boil it 
mtly, adding the juioe of two lemons, and 
UMB strain it fiNrnse. 

JELLY, CHERRY. Take the stones 
and stalks Grom two pounds of fine clear 
ripe cherries; mix them with a quarter of 
a pound of red currants, from which the 
seeds have been extracted; express the 
juice fitHn these fiuits, filter and mix it with 
tfaieeK)uarterB of a poimd of clarified sugar, 
and one ounce of ismglass. Finish the same 
as Barherry jetty, 

JELLY OF CURRANTS, GRAPE, 



RASPBERRY, Are all made prseiselT 
in the same manner. When the firuit is fin 
ripe, gather it on a dry day: as soon as it 
is nicely picked, put it into a jar, and cover 
it down very close. 

Set the jar in a saucepan alxMit three 
parts filled with cold water ; put it on a gen- 
tle fire, and let it simmer for about half aa 
hour. Take the pan fi*um the fire, and pov 
the contents of the jar into a jelly-bag: pass 
the juice through a second time; do not 
squeeze the liag. 

To each pint of juice add a pound and a 
half of very good lump sugar pounded ; when 
it is dissolved, put it into a preser^'ing-pao ; 
set it on the fire, and boil gently; stirring 
and tdcimming it the whole time (about thir- 
ty or forty minutes), t. c. till no more scum 
rife-es, and it is perfectly clear and fine: 
pour it while warm into pots; and whea 
cold, cover them with papor wetted in 
brandy. 

Half a pint of this jelly, dissolved in a 
pint of brandy or vinegar, will give yon 
cellent cuirant or raspberry brandy or 
gar. 

Oha. — Jellies firom other fimits are made 
in the same way, and cannot be preserved 
in perfection without plenty of goon sugar. 

Those who wish jelly to turn out very stil^ 
dissolve isinglass m a little water, strain 
through a sieve, and add it in the {m^xirtioa 
of liaU* an ounce to a pint of juioe, and p«t 
it in with the sugar. 

Tbe best way is the cheapest. Jdliei 
made with two small a proportion of sugar, 
recfuire boiling so long; there is muc^ mora 
waste of juice and flavor by eva|XMntion than 
the due quantity of sugar costs ; and thq^ 
neither look nor taste luilf so well. 



JELLY, DAMSON. To eigbt 
of damsons, put eight pounds of fine suoar, 
and half a pint of wata*; boil them for naif 
an hour over a gentle fire, till tbe skina 
break ; then take them off, and set them hj 
for an hour; set them on the fire agaio, for 
half an liour mmv; set them by again fer 
tbe same time; do so the third time; while 
they stand off the fire, put a weight upoa 
them to keep them under the simp. The 
last time, you must boil them till yon per- 
ceive they are of a very hisfa oolor in ihft 
part where the skin is brokui; then tska 
them off, set Hbem by to cool, and when tb^ 
are ooki, drain off the sirup, and make the 
jelly in the following manners— Boil a quan- 
tity of green apples, green gooseberries, ani 
quince cores, to a mash ; then strain theei 
tlirough a hair sieve. Take an ec^ual quan- 
tity of this jelly and the former simp, and 
boil them over a sentle fire together till th^ 
jelly; skim it well, and while it is hot, pot 
it into glasses w pots.

sugar and isinglass should be no more than 
lukewarm when mixed together. These 
jeUies may be made of any kind of fruit, or 
the gratea rinds of lemon, cMrange, or ce* 
drats. 

JELLY, GLOUCESTER. Take an 
wmoe of rioe, the same of sago, pearl-barley, 
faartghom.flhavin^, and eringo root; sim- 
mer with three pmts of water, till redticed 
to one pint, strain it. When cold it will be 
a jelly ; when vou use it, serve dissolved in 
wioe, milk, or broth. 

JELLY, GRAPE. Take out the stones, 
tbeai mash the grapes with your hands, (they 
must be ripe) then squeeae them du*ough a 
ciodi to extract all the juice from them, and 
boil and finish the same as currant jelly. 
Use half a pound of sugar to each pound of 
Ihiit. 

JELLY, HARTSHORN. Boil half a 
poimd of hartshorn shavings for three hours 
and a half in four pints and a half of water; 
strain it through a bit of muslin, and stir in- 
to it three ounces of dissolved isinglass ; if 
laife, the peel of one, if small, of two km- 
<MM, and their juice, half the peel of an or- 
anee, three parts of a tea«cupful of brandy, 
and one of white wine ; sweeten with pound- 
ed kmf sugar, and when lukewarm put it 
into a saucepan with the beaten whites of 
six eggs ; stir it, and let it boil for two min- 
Btes ; strain it through a jelly-bag two or 
three times till perfectly clear.

of eight oranges and six lemons, ^^rate the 
peri of half the fruit, and steep it in a pint 
of cold water ; mix it with the juice, three- 
qoarters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce 
auid a quarter of isinglass, and the beaten

minutes, and strain it through a jelly-bag till 
cJesr; put it into a mould or glasses. 



JELLY, ORANGE. (2) Boil in m 
pint of water one oune^^md a quarler of 
pisked isinglasB, the rind of an orange out 
thin, a stick of cinnamon, a few ocMriandera» 
and three ounces of knf sugar, till the isin- 
glass is dissolved ; thai squeeie two Seville 
oranges or lemons, and enoivfa oranges to 
make a pint of juhse : mix all together, and 
strain it through a tamis or lawn sieve into 
a basin ; set it in a cold place for half •■ 
hour ; pour it into another faasm ' free finon 
sediment ; and when it begins to congeal, 
fill vour mouM : when wanted, dip the 
mouki into lukewarm water ; turn it out oa 
a dish, and garnish with orange or lemon 
rut in slices, and placed round. N. B.— >A 
few grains of safiron put in the water will 
add much to its appearance. 

JELLY, OX-HEEL. Slit them in two, 
and take away the £it between the claws. 
The proportMHi of water to each heel is 
about a quart: let it simmer gently for eight 
hours (keeping it clean skimmed); it will 
make a pint and a half of strong jelly, which 
is frequoitly used to make calf's feet Jelfy> 
or to add to mock turtle and other soups. 

JELLY, PEACH. Cut ten or twelve 
peaches in halves, take ouf the stmies and 
peel them ; set a pint of nnooth clarified an* 
|;ar, diluted with water, on the fire ; when 
It has boiled and been skimmed, put in the 
peaches, the kernels should foe bnoken and 
put in with them ; let them boil, very gently 
for ten minutes, then take out four or five 
of the lialves, and lay them aa a plate to be 
in readiness for garnishing the jelly; let 
the remainder of the peaches boil for ten 
minutes longer ; while they are boiling take 
three lemons, cut off the rind, squeeze the 
juice through a silk sieve in a basin, pass 
the liquor of tlie peaches into it, and then 
the isinglass, running it through the sieve 
two or three times, in order to mix it well; 
fill die mould lialf full of jelly, and when set, 
put in the peaches and a little more jelly, 
and when that is set, fill up the mould. 
The reason why the lemons are P^led be> 
fore thev are sciueezed f(H' this jeU^ is, that 
the oil m the rind wouM rather spoil the fla- 
vor of the jelly, than be any addition. 

JELLY, QUINCE. Quhices for jellf 
ought not to be quite ripe, they shodd, bow^ 
ever, be of a fine yellow oofor; take off the

another vessel: weigh it, and put it, with 
half the quantity of sugar, into a preserving 
pan, set it on the fire; a great deal of sciun

sugar, and when cold, the juice of one or two 
lemons mav be added with the isinglass. 

A little iemon juioe may be added to any 
of the other jellies, in pn^rtion to the acid- 
ity of the finjut. 

They may be iced by covering and siur- 
nwnding the mould with ice, without any salt. 

JUICE. The proportion of oranges 
shouM be double that of lemons; the finiit 
being selected free from decay, and wiped 
dry, they are to be squeezed, and the juice

KIDNEYS. OiC tham through the \a^ 
way, score them, and sprinkle them over 
with a little pepper and sah; in order to 
broil all over alike, and to keep them (ran 
curling oo the nridiron, run a wire skewer 
right through diem. Hiey must be broiled 
over a clear fire, being carefiil to turn them 
fi^uently till they are done; thcnr will take 
about ten or twelve minutes broiling, provi- 
ded they are done over a brisk fire ; or, if 
you chooae, you may fry them in butter, and 
make gravy for then in the pan (after the 
kidneys are taken out), by pcrtting m a tea- 
spoonful of flour; as soon as it looks brown, 
pot in a sufficient quantity of water as will 
make gravy; they will take five minutes 
kmger flying than broiling. Garnish with 
friM parsley : you may improve them if yoa 
think proper, by chopping a few paralev 
leaves very fine, mix than with a bit of fresb 
butter, and a little pepper and salt, and thei» 
put some <^ this mixture over each kidney.

small pieces of this mixture on white pa()er^ 
make each drop about tlie size c^ a ratafia, 
rather conical than flat; place the paper 
which contains them on a piece of wood 
about an inch thick, and put them in a very 
hot oven : watch them, and as soon as you 
perceive they begin to look yellowish, take 
them out, and detach them fiiom the paper 
with a knife as cautiously as possible, for 
they are very tender. TaKe a small spoon^ 
and with the end of it remove the moist part^ 
which is at the bottom, so as to make tbeiik 
a little holk>w, and as you do diem, lay eacb

LAMB. Hie ibre quarto' of lamb con- 
sists of (he shoulder, the neck, and the 
lireast together; the hind quarter is thQ W 
and loin. There are also the head and 
pluck, the £7 or sweetbreads, .skirts, lamb- 
Atones, and livei*. In choosing the fore 
Quarter, the vein in the neck shomd be rud- 
y, or of a bluish color. In the hind quar- 
ter, the knuckle should feel jstiff, the kidney 
«mall4 and perfectly fresh. To keep it, the 
joints should be carefully wiped every day, 
and in warm weather, sprinkled witli a lit- 
tle pepper. The fore quarter is the prime 
joint, and should be roasted and basted 
f^ith butter; the gravy is made as for beef 
or mutton. Mint sauce is served in a sauce 
tureen, and half a lemon is sent to table 
with it, the juice of which is squeesEed upon 
Hoe ribs a^fler the should^ b cut off, and 
|hey have been sprinkled with salt. If the 
joint weighs five pounds, it will require to 
qe roasted one hour; if ten pounds^ one hour 
and three-quarters.. The hind quarter may 
1)6 roasted, or the leg of it boiled. The 
Ipin is then ^ut into steaks, frjed, and serv- 
^ round it ; the outside bones being cover- 
ed with 9. Ange of firied parsl^. A dish 
(^ spinach is generally served with the 
lamb. 

LAMB. Is a delicate, and commonly 
considered teqder meat; but diqse vlw talk 
of tender lamb, while they are thinking of 
die age of the ^nimal, forget tk^t even a 
ehicken must ,be kf^pt a proper time afier it 
has been killed, or it will be tough picking. 
To the usual accompaniments of roastra 
meaty green mint sauce, and a salad« is cdm- 
qoonly added; and some cooks, about five 
minutes b^re it is done, sprinkle it with a 
little frcsli gathered and finfely minced pars- 
Ipy, Lamb, and all youqg meats, ought to bis 
Ijiorougbly done ; therefore do not take eitlier 
lamb or veal oflf the spit till you see it drop 



got, mint vinegar is ui aooeplable sdbetitolt 
for it ; and crisp parsley on a side plate, is 
an admirable accompaniment.

you take ofi* the shoulder from the ribs, to 
squeeze a Seville orange over them, and 
NH-inkle them with a little pepper and salt. 
Tliis may as well be done oy the cook b^ 
fore it comes to table ; some people are not 
remarkably expert at dividing tneee joints 
nicely.

LAMB PIE, THE GERMAN WAY. 
Oit a quarts of lamb into pieces, and lard 
them with small lardons cf bacon, season- 
ed with salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a 
bay4eaf ; add fet bacon poimded, small on- 
ioos, nutmeg, and sweet herbs; put these

when baked, cut it open, skim ofi^ all the 
fiit, pour in a ragout of oysters, and serve 
hot. 

LAMB PEE, A SAVORY ONE. Cut 
iSae meat into pieces, and season it with 
pemr, salt, mace, ckves, and nutmeg, 
(ndy beaten. Make a gjood puff paste 
emst, put the meat into it, with a few 
hmb atones and sweetbreads, seaaoned 



the same as the meat. Then pot in 
oysters and forcemeat balk, the yolks of 
hard egn, and the tops of asparagus, aboot 
two indies kmr, first boiled green. Put 
butter all over die pie, put on die lid, and 
let it bake for an hour and a half in a quick 
oven. In the meantime, take a pint of gra- 
vy, die oyster liquor, a gill of reel wine, and 
a little grated nutmeg. M he oil together 
with the yolks of two or three eggs, fin^ 
beaten, and keep stirring it the same way 
all the time. When it boils, poor it into 
the pie, put on the lid again, and serve it to 
table. 

LAMB, TO ROAST OR BOIL. A 

quarter of an hour is generally allowed to 
each pound of meat ; a leg or lamb of five 
pounos will therefore take an hour and a 
quarter to roast or boil, the other joints in 
the same proportion ; serve either with sa- 
lad, pickies, brocoli, caulifiowers, string 
beans, pease, potatoes, or cucundbers, raw 
or stewed. 

LAiflB SHOULDER, GRILLED. Boil 
it ; score it in chequers about in inch square, 
rub it over with the yolk of an ^;g, pepper 
and salt it, strew it with bread-cnimDs and 
dried parsley, or sweet herbs, and earbo- 
nado, i. e. grill, «. e. broil it over a clear 
fire, or put It in a Dutch oven till it is a 
nice light brown ; send up some gravy with 
it, or make a sauce for it of flour and water 
well mixed togedier wiUi an ounce of fresh 
butto*, a table-spoonful of mushroom or 
walnut ketchup, and the juice of half a lem- 
on. See Gnll sauce. Breasts of lamb 
are often done in the same way, and with 
mushroom or mutton sauce. 

LAMB STEAKS FRIED. Fry diem 
of the nicest brown; when sorved, throw 
over them a good quantity of crumbs of 
bread fi^, and cruped parsley. Or yoa 
may season them and broil them in buttered 
papers, either with crumbs and herbs, or 
without, according to taste. 

LARD, HOG*S. The lard should be 
carefiilfy melted in a jar, put into a kettle 
of water, and boiled; run it into bladders 
that have beoi particularly well cleaned. 
It is best to have the bladders small, as the 
lard will keep better, for, after the air 
reaches it, it becomes rank. Whilst it is 
melting, put in a sprig of rosemary. This 
being a very useful article in frying fish, it 
should be prepared with great care. Mix- 
ed with batter, it makes a fine <»ruBt.

be sufficioit time to roast them in before a 
quick fire; whilst they are roastine, baste 
uem with fi:esh butter, and sprinkle than 
with bread-crumbs till they are well cover- 
ed with them. Fr^ some gi-ated bread in 
butter, set it to dram before the fire, that it 
may harden. Serve the crumbs in the dish 
under the larks, and garnish with slices of 
lemon. 

LAVENDER DROPS. Fill a quart 
bottle with the blossoms of lavender, and 
pour on it as much brandy as it will contain ; 
let it stand ten days, theu straui it, and add 
of nutmeg bruised, cloves,' mace, and cochi- 
neal, a quarter of an ounce each, and bot- 
tle it for use. In nervous cases, a little may 
be taken dropped mi a bit of sugar; and in 
the beginning of a bowel compuint, a tea- 
spoonfijl, taken in half a glass of pepper- 
mint water, will oiien prove efiicacious. 

LAVENDER WATER. Put into a 
large bottle, ei^t ounces of the best recti- 
fied spirits of wine, three drachms of oil of 
lavender, one drachm of essence of ambor- 
gris, and threepence-worth of musk ; cork 
It tightly, and shake it well every day, for 
a fi>rtnight or three weeks. 

LEAVES, TO GREEN, FOR ORNA- 
MENTING FRUIT. Take small leaves 
of a pear-tree, keep them close stopped in 
a pan of verjuice and water, give tliem a 
boil in some sirup of apricots ; put them be- 
tween two pieces of glass to dry; smooth 
and cut than into the diape of apricot- 
leaves (the leaves should be procured with 
stalks); stick them about the apricots or 
any other preserved firuit; but the leaves 
must be cut in the shape of the leaf which 
belongs to the firuit you ornament. 

LEEKS. Leeks are most generaDy used 
fiur soups, ragouts, and other made dfishes, 
they are very rarely brought to table ; in 
which case dress them as follows:— Put 
them into the stock-fx>t till about three parts 
done; then take them out, drain, and soak 
them in vinegar seasoned with peppor, salt, 
and cloves; drain them again, stuff the 
hearts with B.faree, dip them in batter, and 
6ry than. 

LEIPZEGER PANCAKES. Beat well 
the whites of four, and the yolks of eight 
fi«sh eggB, and suld, by degrees, l^df a 
pound <u pounded kiaf sugar, a pint and a 
naif of sweet cream just warmed, half a 
poond of clarified finesh batter, two tabfe- 



spoonfiils of fiwh yeatr, and a wine-ffafli tUB 
of spirits of wine ; then mix in as mwli sifted 
flour as will make it into a thick batter; 
let it rise for half an hour; roll it out thia; 
cut it into ixNmds or oblong pieces, and hj 
on them jam or marmalaoe; double them, 
and let them stand again to rise, and fiy 
them in boiling fiivsh lard or butter. 



LEMONADE. To a gallon of 
water add some cinnamon and cloves, plo^ 
ty of orange and plen^ of lemon-juice, and 
a bit of tlie peel of each; sweeten well with 
loaf sugar, and whisk it with the whites of 
six ^gs, and the yolk (^oae; give it a boil, 
and u^n let it simmer for ten minutes; dan 
run it through a jelly-bag, and let it stand 
till cold, before it is drank. 

LEMONADE TRANSPARENT. IT* 
peel erf* fourteen lemons having been soaked 
in two quarts of water (or two hours, their 
juice, one pound and a half of sugar,' and a 
quart of white wine, are to be added; a 
quart of new milk, nuule boiling hot, is dan 
to be mixed with it, and when it has stood 
an hour, it is to be strained through a jdly^ 
bog till it runs clear. 

LEMON BONBONS. Take two poon^ 
of the best lump sugar, clarify and boil it to 
caramel; but just before it reaches dat 
point, grate the rind of a lemon and put in 
It; in the meanwhile melt a little butter; 
skim, and pour it off clear; take a spoonfid 
of this butter, and rub it with your hand over 
a copperplate or marUe slab, on which pov 
the caramel sugar: then have a sword blad^ 
take an end in each hand, and impress linei 
in the sugar about an inch apart ; then im* 
press similar lines across the first, so as to 
form small cakes ; this opnati<m dioiihl be 
performed as quickly as possible, lest the 
sugar shouM cool before the whole is maik* 
ed; when howevor all is done, pass the 
blade carefiilly between the sugar and the 
slab, lay it on sheets of white paper, and 
when perfectly coM, separate the oonftoiM, 
and wrap eaoi in paper; keeip them in a 
dry place. 

LEMON BRANDY. Three qoarts cT 
brandy being put into an earthen jar that ii 
fitted with a cover, a pound and th roe - q u r * 
ters of fine kiaf sugar, the thin paringa at 
six lemons, and the juice of twelve, are ts 
be added; one quart of boiling milk is to ha 
poured over the mixture, vraich must be 
stirred daily for eight di^; it is then to be 
run through a jelly-bag and bottled. 



LEMON CHEESECAKES. Bott 
peel of two laige lemons till they are 
teader, and then poud it 'weU in a 



LEM

LEM 



with fiHBr or five omoes of loaf Mgar, the 
yolks of six eggs, half a poaod oi fi^sh bet- 
ter, and a litde cord beatoi &ie: pound and 
mix altogether, lay a rich puff paste in some 
patty-pans, fill them half full, and bake them 
carefiiUy. 

LEMON CHEESECAKES. Mix four 
ounces of sifted kanp sugar, and four ounces 
of butter together, and gently melt it; then 
add the yolks of two, and the white of one 
■egg, the rind of three lemons shred fine, and 
the juice of one lemon and a half, one sa- 
vory biscuit, some blanched almcHidb, pound- 
ed, three spoonfuls of brandy; mix the 
whole well together,- and pot it to paste 
made with the following ingredients: eight 
ounces of fiour, six ounces of butter, two- 
thirds of which must be mixed with the 
floor first; then wet it with six spoonfuls of 
"water, and roll in the remainder of the but- 
ter. 

LEMON CHIPS. Take large smooth- 
rinded Malaga lemons ; race or cot off their 
peel into chips with a small knife (this will 
require smne practice to do it properly) ; 
throw them into salt and water till next 
day; hare ready a pan of boiling water, 
tlvow than in and boil them tender. Drain 
them well: after havmg lain sometime in 
water to cool, put them in an earthen pan, 
pour over enough boiling clarified sugar to 
taver them, and then let them lie two days ; 
then strain the sirup, put more sugar, and 
reduce it bnr boiling till the sirup is quite 
thick ; pat m the chips, and simmer them a 
few minutes, and set them by for two days : 
repeat it once more ; let them be two days 
logger, and they wiU be fit to candy, which 
must be done as folbws: take four pints of 
clarified sugar, whidi will be sufficient for 
six pounds of chips, boil it to the degree of 
blown (which may be known by dipping the 
skinmier into the sugar, and blowing strong- 
ly throogfa the holes of it; if little bladdera 
appear, it has attained that degree); and 
vvfaen the chips are thorough^ drained and 
wiped on a clean cloth, put them into the 
tirup, stirring them about with the skimmer 
till yoo see the sugar become white; dien 
take them out with two forks; diake them 
lightly into a wire sieve, and set them into 
a stove, CHT in a virarm place to dry. Orange 
chips are done in the same way. 

LEMON ESSENCE. Rasp your lem- 
ons all round, very thin, and for every quar- 
ter of a pound of rind, allow one pound of 
mgar; mix it well with a large spaddle tiU 
yon find it is all of the same color, and that 
the rind is well mixed ; pot it into a stone 
jar, and press it down as hard as you can; 
pot a bladder over the paper yoo cow with, 

10 



and tie it over quite tight; put it by, and m 
a month's time it will be fit for use. 

LEMON JUICE TO PRESERVE. 

Squeexe, and strain a pint of lemon-juioe; 
put into a China basin one pound of double- 
refined sugar finely pounded and sifted, add 
the lemon-juice, and stir it with a silver 
spoon till the sugar be perfectly dissolved. 
£k>ttle it, and cork it tightly ; seal the cork, 
or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry 
cool place. 

LEMON MARMALADE. AUow to a 
pound of lemons eighteen ounces of fine 
loaf sugar ; grate the rind of a few ; cut 
them into half; squeeze and strain the juice ; 
boil the skins in the same way as those 
of the orange skins are done ; scoop out the 
pulp and white part; cot half into thin chips 
or parings, and pound the other half in a 
mortar ; pound tlie sugar, . and pour over it 
the juice ; stir, and let it boil for five min- 
utes; skim it; take it off the fire; put in the 
parings and the pounded skins; boil it for 
five minutes, then add the grated peel, and let 
it boil for five minutes more ; take it off, and 
stir it till half cold, before putting it into jars. 

LEMON MINCE PIES. Squeeze out 
the juice from a large lemon ; boil the out- 
side till sufficiently tender to beat to a mash, 
add to it three large apples chopped, and 
four ounces of suet, half a pound of currants, 
four ounces of sugar ; put the juice of the 
lemon, and add candied fruit, the same as 
for other pies. Make a short crust, and fiQ 
the patty-pans in the usi^al manner. 

LEMON-PEEL ESSENCE. Wash 
and brush clean the lemons ; let them get 
perfectly dry: take a lump of loaf sugar, and 
rub them till all the yellow rind is taken up 
by the sugar: scrape off the surfece of the 
mgar into a preserving pot, and press it 
hard down ; cover it very close, and it will 
keep for sometime. 

LEMON-PEEL QUINTESSENCE. 
Best oil of lemon, one drachm, strongest 
rectified spirit, two ounces, introduced by 
d^reea till the spirit kills, and completely 
mixes with the ofl. This elegant prepara- 
tion possesses all the delightful firagranoe and 
flavor of the freshest lemon-peel. 06a. — ^A 
few drops on the sugar you make punch with 
will instantly impregnate it with as mnch 
fiavor as the tro^lesome and tedious meth- 
od of grating the rind, or mbbme the sugar 
on it. It will be found a superiative sub- 
stitute for firesh lemon-peel for every purpose 
that it is used for: blancmange, jellies, cus- 
tards, ice, negus, lemonade, and pies and pod-^ 
dings, stuffings, soaps, mioes, ragouts, &c.

LEMON-PEEL TINCTURE. A veiy 
easy and economical way of obtaimrif , and 
preserving the flavor of Kmon-peel, is lo fill 
a wideHUouthed pint bottle half full of bi'an- 
dy, or proof spirit; and when you use a 
lemon, pwe the rind off very thjn, and put 
it into the brandy, &c.: in a fortnight it 
will impregnate the spirit with the flavor 
very strongly. 

LEMON PICKLE. (1) Grate off a 

little of tlie outer rind of two dosen of lem- 
ons, divide them into four rather more than 
half wray down, leaving the bottom part 
whole ; rub on them equally half a pound 
of finely-beaten salt, spread them upon a 
lar^ dish, and put them into a cool oven. 
When the juice has dried up, put tliem into 
a stone jar, witii an ounce of cloves and one 
of mace finely beaten, one ounce of nutm^ 
cut into thin slices, a quarter of an ounce of 
cayenne, and four ounces of garlic peeled, 
also half a pint of white mustaird-seed bruis- 
ed and tied in a bit of muslin. Pour over 
the whole two quarts of boiling vinegar, 
stop the jar closely, and let it stand for three 
months ; then strain it through a hair sieve, 
pressing it well through ; let it stand till the 
next day, pour off the clear, and put it into 
small bottles. Let the dregs stand covered 
some days, when it will become fine. It 
will keep good for years. When the lem- 
ons are to be used as pickle, no straining is 
necessary. 

LEMON PICKLE. (2) Cut into quar- 
ters, and pick out all the seeds of six mid- 
dling sized lemons; put them into a jar, 
strew over them two ounces of well beaten 
salt ; cover the jar with a cloth and plate, 
and let it stand three days ; then put to them 
cloves and a quarter of an ounce of mace 
beaten fine, one ounce of garlic or shallot, 
two of mustard-seed bruised, and one nut- 
meg sliced. Make a quart of vinegar boil- 
ing hot, and pom* it over the ingredients ; 
cover the jar, and in tliree or four days close 
it with a bung, and tie leather over it. It 
will be fit for use in a week, and is an im- 
provement to most sauces, and particularly 
to fish sauce. 

LEMON POSSET. Squeeze the juice 
of two lemons into a China bowl, or small 
deep dish, that will hold a quart; sweets 
it like sirup, add a little brandy ; boil one 
pint of cream with a bit of orange-peel; 
take out the peel ; when cold, put tlie cream 
into a teapot, pour it to the sirup, hokling 
it high. Make it the day befote it is want- 
ed. 

LEMON PUDDING. Set Pudding, 



LEMON RINDS MARMALADE. 

Having squeezed the juice fhwn your lemoan, 
cut out all the white part, and pot the rinds 
into boiling water ; as sooa as they begin to 
soften, take them firom the fire, uid throw 
diem into cold water; then lay them on a 
sieve to drain, and make them into marma- 
lade, in the same manner as apricots. Or- 
ange rinds are done this way. 



LEMON SPONGE. Boil half an 
of isinglass in a pint of vrater till dissolved; 
strain it, and the following day a<)d the 
juice of two lemons, and the grated peel ef 
one; rub 'through a hair sieve, into the isia- 
glass a good quantity of raspberry jam, that 
has stood before tne fire some time, and 
whisk it all together till like a sponge; pot 
it into an earthen mould, set it in a ooid 
f.lace for some hours, and turn it out. Any 
< ther sort of preserve may be used, and ■ 
made with only orange or lemon-juice, 
sweeten it with sugar, or make it with 
orange jelly which may have been left the 
day before. 

LEMON SYLLABUBS. Take a pint 
of cream, a pint of white wine, the peel of 
two lemons grated, and tlie juice ; sugar u> 
cording to taste; let it stand some time; 
mill or whip it, lay the fr-oth on a sieve; put 
the remainder into glasses, and lay on the 
froth. Tliey should be made the day befeve 
they are wanted. If you should wuh them 
to taste very strong of the lemon, you mart 
make use of the juice of six lemons, and 
nearly a pound of sugar; they will keep 
four or five days. 

LEMONS, SIRUP OF. Put a pint of 
fresh lemon-juice to a pound and tliree> 
quarters of lump sugar; dissolve it by a 
gentle heat ; skim it till the surfeuse is quite 
clear; add an ounce of thin-cut lemon-pied; 
let them simmer (very ^pntly) together for a 
few minutes, and run it through a fiannd. 
When cold, bottle and cork it cloeely, and 
keep it in a cool pbce^ Or, Diseohre a 
quarter of an ounce (avoirdupois) of ckrie, 
i. e. crystallized lemon acid, in a pint of 
clarified sirup; fiavor it with the ped, w 
dissolve the acid in equal parts of simpk 
sirup, and sirup of lemon-peel. 

LEMON WATER. Put two slKes of 
thinly pared lemon into a teapot, a little bit 
of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a fause 
spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint of bo» 
ing water, and stc^ it close for two hours. 



LEMON CONSERVE, WHITE. 
a pound of the finest sugar, take it off the 
fire, and squeeze into it the jui^e of one 
lemon at diflerent times, atirriagiwtfmiMllyg

it wii) oMke the sugar ai white ai milk if 
|ii m jet'l y done ; take cars not to drop any 
of the feeds into it; wotk it well together, 
SHid when it is of an equal substance (which 
prove inthesamemanoor as any other jelly), 
pour it into a mould. Lemmi conserve is 
made in the same auumer, only that the su- 
gar must be boiled to a greater height than 
far white lemon conserve. 

LOBSTER. Buy these alive; the lob- 
ster merchants sometimes keep them till 
they are starved, before they boil tliem ; 
ihey are then watoy, have not lialf their 
flavor, and like other persons that die of a 
consumptltHi, have lost the calf of their legs. 
Choose those that (as an old cook says, are 
" heavy and lively," and) are fiill of mo- 
tion, which is the index of their freshne^. 
Those of the middle size are the best. Nev- 
er take them when the shell is incrusted, 
which is a sign they are old. Tlie male 
lohster is preferred to eat, and the female 
(on account of the egss) to make sauce of. 
The hen lobster is distinguished by having a 
broader tail than the male, and less claws. 
Set on a pot, with water suited in propor- 
tion of a table-spoonful of salt to a quail of 
water; when tlie water boils, put it in, and 
keep it boiling briskly from half an huur to 
an hour, according to its size; wipe all tlie 
scum off it, and rub tlie shell with a very 
little butter or sweet oil; break off die 
great claws, crack diem carefully in eadi 
joint, so that tliey may not be sliattered, 
and yet come to pieces easily ; cut the tm\ 
down tlie middle, and send up die body 
whole. 

LOBSTERS, to choose, Tlie lieaviest 
are considered the best. When alive, if diey 
are quite fresh, the claws will have a strong 
motimi when you put your finger on the eyes 
and press them. When you buy diem i-eady 
boiled, try whether tiieir tails are stiff and 
puU up with a spring, otlierwise that part 
will be flabby. The cock-lobster may be 
distinguished from the hen by the naii'ow 
back part of the tail, and the two uppermost 
fins within it are stiff and hard ; but diose 
of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. 
The- male, though generally the smallest, has 
the hiffhest flavor, the flesh is firmei*, and 
the color wlien boiled is a deeper red. They 
oonae in about April, and remain in season 
till the oysters return. Hen lobsters are 
preferred for sauces, on account of their 
ooraJ. 

ICJ^ LobHrrs are eoid in Boston, tU- 
ready boiled, and are always fresh and 
gm>d. 

LOBSTER A LA BRAISE. Pound 
the moat of a large lobstar very fine with 



two uu oc M Of bottflTf and nuon it with 
grated nutmeg* salt, anid white pqiper; add 
a little grated bread, beat up two eggs, t^ 
serve part to put over the meat, aiM with 
the rest make it up into the form of a lol> 
ster. Puond the spawn and red part, and 
spread it over it ; bake it a quarter of aa 
hour, and just be^>re sei-ving, lay over it the 
tail and body shell, with the small clani put 
underneath to resemble a lobster. 

LOBSTERS OR CRABS, buttered. 
Pick all the meat from the bodies of either, 
mince it small, put it into a saucepan with 
two 01' three table-spoonfuls of white wine, 
one of lemon-pickle, and three or four of 
rich gravy, a bit of butter, some salt, pep- 
per, and grated nutm^; thicken it with 
the yolks of two eggs beat up, and when 
quite hot, put it into the large sliells; gar- 
nish them with an edguig of bread toasted. 

LOBSTER FRICASSEE. Break dw 
shells, and take out the meat carefully, cut 
it and the red part, or coral, into pieces, 
ad<ling the spawn; thicken with flour and 
butter some white stock, with whicli the 
sliells have beei boiled; sesison it with 
white |)epprr, mace, aiul tmlt, put in the 
lobster and lieat it up ; jiist before serving, 
add a little lemon-juice, or lemon pickle. 
The stock may be made wltli Uie shells, only' 
Uiiled in a pint of water, with some white 
pepper, salt, and a little mace, thickened 
with cream, flour, and butter. 

LOBSTER KETCHUP. Qioose a 
lobster that ia full of spawn, and weighing 
as nearly as possible three pounds ; pick out 
all the meat, iuid pound (be red part or co- 
ral in a marble mortar; wlien completely 
bruised, add the meat ; pound, and moisten 
it with a little shei-ry wine, mix widi it a 
tea-spoonful of cayenne, add die rest of die 
bottle of slierry, and mix it thoroughly ; put 
it into two wide-moutlied bottles, and on 
the top put a small table-spoonful of whole 
[lepper, cork the bottles tightly, and tie 
them over with leather. It ^i\\ keep good 
a twelve-month, and exactly resembles h-esh 
lobster sauce. Four table-spoonfuls heated 
in melted butter ai-e sufficient for a large 
sauoe-Uu-een. 

LOBSTER PATTIES. (1) Pick die 
meat and rad berries out of a lobster, mince 
them finely, add grated bread, cliopped pai's- 
levt aud mitter; season with grated nutmeg, 
white pepper, and salt; add a little white 
stock, cream, and a table-spoonful of while 
wine, with a few chopped oysters ; heat it 
all together. Line the patty-pans with puflT 
paste; put into each a bit of crumb of bread, 
about an inch square, wet the edge of the 



LOB 



112 



Mac 



paste, and cover it with another bit; with 
the paste-cutter mark it all round the rim, 
and pare off the paste round the edge of the 
patty-pan. When baked, take off the top, 
and with a knife take out the bread and a 
little '^of the inside paste, put in the prepar- 
ed lobster, lay on the top paste, and serve 
them in a napkin. Another way to pre- 
pare the paste. — Roll it out nearly half an 
inch thick, and cut it into rounds with a 
tin cutter, and, with one or two sizes less, 
mark it in the middle about half tlirough. 
When they are baked, carefully cut out the 
inner top of the paste, and scoop out the in- 
side, so as to make room for the mince, which 
pot in, and place on the top. 

LOBSTER PATTIES. (2) Prepare the 
patties as in the last receipt. Take a hen 
lobster ah^ady boiled ; pick the meat from 
the tail and ckws, and t;hop it fine ; pit it 
into a stewpan, with a little of the inside 
spawn pounded in a mortar till quite smooth, 
an ounce of fi'esh butter, half a gill of cream, 
and half a gill of veal consomme, cayenne 
pepper, and salt, a tea-spoonful of essence 
of anchovy, the same of lemon-juice, and a 
table-(^x>onfuI of flour and water: stew it 
five minutes. 

LOBSTER PIE. (1) Boil the lobsters, 
and cut the meat of the tail into four bits ; take 
out the meat firom the claws and bodies, 
pound it in a mortal*, add the soft pait of 
one lobster, and season with pepper, salt, 
and nutmeg, add three table-spoonfuls of 
vinegar ; melt half a pound of butter, and 
mix it with the pounded meat and the crumb 
of a slice of grated bread. Put puff paste 
round the edge and side of l!he dish ; put in 
the tail of the lobster, then a layer of oys- 
ters with tlieir liquor, and next the pounded 
meat ; cover it with a puff paste, and bake 
it till the paste be done. Before serving, 
pour in some rich gravy, made of a little 
weak stock in which the lobster shells have 
Been boiled, with an onion, pepper, and. 
salt, and which lias beea strained and thick- 
ened with a bit of butter rolled in flour. 

LOBSTER PIE. (2) Take out, as 
whole as possible, the meat from tlie tail 
and claws of two or three boiled lobsters ; 
cut them into slices, and season tliem with 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Make a force- 
meat of tbe soft part of tlie bodies, together 
with grated bread, some parsley, and one 
anchovy minced, grated lemon-peel, mace, 
salt, and pepper, the yolks of two hard- 
boiled effgs braised, and a bit of butter; mix 
it aU together with the well-beaten yolk of 
an e^, and make it up into small balls. 
'Pot the lobster into the pie-diish, and cover 
,h with the forcemeat baJhi, and hard4x>iled 



yolks of ^gs; add more than half a pint of 
rich white slock, a glass of white wine, and 
a table-spoonful of lemmi-juiee. or vinegar. 
Cover it with puff paste, and bake it osAj 
till the paste be done. 

LOBSTER SAUC£. Choose a fine 
spawny hen lobster; be sure it is finesb, pick 
out the spawn and the red coral into a mor- 
tar, add to it half an ounce of butter, pound 
it quite smooth, and rab it through a hair- 
sieve witli the back of a wooden spoon ; cot 
the meat of the lobster into small squares, w 
pull it to pieces with a fork ; put the poimd- 
ed spawn into as much melted butter as yoa 
think will do, and stir it togeth^ till it is 
thoroughly mixed ; now put to it the meat 
of die lobster, and warm it on tlie fire; take 
care it does not boil, which will spoil its 
complexion, and its brilliant red color will 
immediately fade. The above is a very easy 
and excellent manner of making this sanoe. 
Some use strong beef or veal gravy instead 
of melted butter, adding anchovy, cayenne, 
ketchup, cavice, lemon-juice, or pickle, or 
wine, &c. 

LUNCHEON FOR AN INVALID. 
Put bread crumbs and red currant, or any other 
jelly, alternately into a tumbler, and when 
nearly half full, fill it up with milk.

it quite IkM in a deep tovoB, and let 
«ndi guest add grated Parmesan and cold 
iMrttier, or oiied batter served hot, and it is 
excellent; this is the most common Italian 
mode of dressing it. Macaroni with cream, 
Bogar, and cinnamon, or a little ▼arioelli 
added to thecreafti, maizes a retry nice sweet 
dish. See Macaroni Pudding for the 
JBoiHng of ii. 

MACARONI DRESSED SWEET. 
Boil two ounces of macaroni in a pint of 
milk, with a bit of lemon-peel, and a good 
bit of cinnamon, till the pipes are swelled to 
their utmost size without breaking. Lay 
them on.a costardHlish, and pour a custard 
o?er them hot. Serve cold. 

MACARONI GRATIN. La^ fried 
bread pretty closely round a didi, boil your 
macaroni in the usual way, and pour it into 
the dish ; smooth it all ovor, and strew bread- 
crumbs on it, then a pretty thick layer of 
grated Parmesan cheese; drop a little melt^ 
ed buttor on it, and color it with a salaman- 
der. 

MACARONI NAPOLITAINE. Boil 
two pounds of macaroni for half an hour, in 
salt and water; then put it into a cullender 
to drain. Take three-quarters of a pound 
of cheese erated ; put a layer of macaroni, 
in a deep dish or tureen, and on it a layer 
of macaroni, the cheese, and so on, alter- 
nately, till both are used up, making the 
cheese the top; pour over it some gravy, 
melt half a pound of fresh butter, and put on 
the whole. Serve it very hot. 

MACARONI TO SERVE. (1) Sim- 
mer it in a little stock, with pounded mace 
and salt. When c^uile tender, take it out 
of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate over it a 
good deal.of clieese, then over diat put bread 
grated very fine. Warm some butter with- 
out oiling, and pour it from a boat through 
a little eartliai cullender all over the crums, 
then put tlic dish in a Dutch oven to roast 
the cheese, and twiown the bread of a fine 
ookir. The bread should be in separate 
crums, and look light. 

MACARONI TO SERVE. (2) Wash 
it w<dl, and simmer it in half milk, and 
half of veal or motion stock, till tlie 
macaroni is tender; then take a spoonful 
of the liquor, put to it the yolk of an eg?, 
beaten b a spoonfiil of cream; just make it 
hot to thicken, but do not let it boil ; pour 
it oY&r the macaroni, and then grate fine old 
dieeseall over it, and add bits of butter; 
fanown it nicely with the salamander. 

MACARONI STEWED. Boilaqoar- 
10* 



ter of a pound of aMearooi in beef stock, |9I 
nearly done; then strain it, and add a gil 
of cream, two ounces of batter, a table spoon* 
fill of the eneooe of ham, tinee ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese, and a little cayenne 
pepper and sak; mix them over a fire for 
five mmutes, then put it on a dish, strew 
grated Paimesan cheese over it, smooth it 
over widi a knife, and ookir it- with a verf 
hot salamander. 



MACARONI TIMBALE. Take 

puff paste, roll it thin, and cut it into narrow 
bands; twist each into a kind of cord, 
which place round the insides of buttered 
moulds, snail foshion ; fill each moukl with 
macaroni, cover the tops with grated bread, 
and Parmesan cheese (equal quantities of 
each) ; put the Timbalee into a warm oven, 
and bake them three-quarters of an hour; 
then turn them on a dish, and serve. 

. MACAROONS. Take a pound of sweet 
almonds blanched, and nicely pounded, add a 
little rose-water to prevent Uieir oiling ; add 
a pound of sified sqgar, then whisk the whites 
of ten eggs to a solid finoth, and add to 
the above; beat all together for some time. 
Have ready wafer paper on tin dates, drop 
the mixture over it separately, the siie of a 
shilling, or smaller; sift over them a little 
.sugar, and bake them. 

MACAROONS, SWEET. Blanch a 
pound of sweet almonds, throw them into 
cold water for a few minutes, lay them in a 
napkin to dry, and leave them for twenty^ 
four hours; at the end o( that time, poood 
tliem, a handfiil at a time, adding occasion* 
ally some white of egg, till the Mmole is re* 
duced to a fine paste; then take two pounds 
of the best lump sugar, pound and sift it» 
then put it to the ahnonds, with the grated 
rinds of two lemons; beat these ingredieoli 
together in the mortar, adding one at a time, 
as many eggs as ^ou find necessary to moists 
en the paste, which shouki be thm, but not 
too mulok so, as in that case it would run; 
your paste being ready, take out a little in a 
spooo,and lay Uie macanxMis on sheets of 
white paptar either round or oval, as you 
pksase; ky them at least an inch apart, be* 
cause they spread in baking, and if put near- 
er wodd touch. Tlie whole of your paste 
bein^ used, place the sheets of paper on 
tins m a moderate oven for three^uarters of 
an hour. 

This kind of cake requires great care and 
attention ; it will be well thearefore to take 
notice of the following rules: 1. To mind 
tliat the ahnonds are perfectly dry before 
you begin to pound them. 2. Take great 
care that not a partkile of the yolk is mixed 
with the white of egg, which would entirely

Kfl the color of the macaroonB, and preveat 
ir nsin^ in the oven; to avoid this, open 
each separately, and if perfectly ft^esh, divide 
the yolK and white with great care. 3. The 
oven must be no more than moderately heat- 
ed, nothing being more lidble to born than 
almonds and sugar ; by the least negligence 
in this respect, the eurfyuce would be oumed, 
whilst the ineide would remain unbaked. 
The best method to obviate any mischief of 
this sort: — put two or three macaroons into 
the oven to try it; leave them in tiie usual 
time; and if, when you take them out, they 
are of a cleaur yellow, the oven is property 
heated, and the whole of the macaroons may 
then be put in. 

MACKEREL, TO CHOOSE. Their 
gills should be of a fine red, dieir eyes full, 
and the whole fish stiff and bright ; if the 
gills are of a fiiint cofer, the fish limber and 
wrinkled, they are not fresh. 

MACKEREL BAKED. Qit off their 
heads, open them, and take out the roes and 
elean them thoroughly ; rub them on the in- 
side with a little pepper and salt, put the 
roes in again, season them (with a mixture 
of powdered allspice, black pepper, and 
•alt, well rubbed together), and lay them 
ckNBe in a baking-pan, cover them with equal 
quantities of cokl vinegar and water, tie^ 
them down with strong white paper doubled, 
and bake them for an hour in a slow oven. 
They will keep for a fortnight. 

MACKEREL BOILED. This fish 
kiees its life as soon as it leaves the sea, and 
the fresher it is die better. Wash and clean 
them thoroughly (the fishmongers seldom do 
this sufficiently), put tliem into cold water 
witli a liandfui of salt in it; let them rather 
simmer than boil ; a small mackerePwill be 
done enoc^ in about a quarter of an hour ; 
when the eye starts and the tail splits, they 
are done ; do not let them stand in the wa- 
ter a moment after; they are so delicate 
that the heat of the water will break them. 

MACKEREL BROILED. Oean a fine 
lai^ mackerel, wipe it on a dry cloth, and 
cut a long slit down the back ; lay it on a 
clean ^idiron, over a very clear, slow fire ; 
when It is done on one side, turn it; be 
careful that it does not haAi; send it up 
with fennel sauce; mix well together a 
little finely minced fennel and parsley, sea- 
soned witn a little pepper and salt, a bit of 
fresh butter, and when the mackerel are 
ready for the table, put sbnpe of this into 
each fish. 

MACKEREL, THE GERMAN WAY. 
Split them down the back» and season them 



with pepper and sah; hro3 ibetf^ MhA flen% 
with the following saooe; pick and wash 
some fennel, parsW, mint, thyme, and greoi 
onions; butuseonjy a small quantity of cadi* 
Boil them tender in a little veal stock ; (hen 
chop them up, and add to fhem some finah 
butter, the liquor they weie boiled in,, some 
grated nutmeg, the juice of half a lemon, a 
fittk; cayenne peppo', and salt. Let it boil, 
thicken it with flour, and serve in a sauce 
boat. 

MADE DISHES. Be carefiil to trin 
off all the skin, gristle, &c. that will not be 
eaten ; and shape handsomely, and of evea 
thickness, the various articles which compose 
your made dishes: this is sadly neglected bf 
common cooks. Only stew tiiem till they 
are just tender, and do not stew them to 
rags; therefore, what you prepare the day 
before it is to be eaten, do not dress quite 
enough (he first day. We have given re- 
ceipts fer the most easyand simpte way to 
make hashes, &c. Those who are wett 
skilled in culinary arts can dress up things 
in this way, so as to be as agi-eeable as th^ 
were the first time th^ were cooked. 

MADELAINES. Take nine ouoces of 
powder-sugar, eight of flour, the yolks of 
four and six whole eggs, two spoonfuls of 
brandy, and a grain of salt ; put these into 
a saucepan, stirring continually, mitii the 
paste thickens ; after which, stir only one 
minute ; clari5^ ten ounces of good fresh but- 
ter, wiUi which, buttei* about two and thirty 
madelaine moulds, pour the remainder of the 
butter into your preparation; set it on a 
gentle stove, stir till it begins to become li- 
quid, take it off before it has time to get too 
hot, put a little of this into each mould, and 
bake them in a moderate oven. '' 

MADELAINES IN SURPRISE. 

Make them in the usual way; when cold, 
cut a thin slice from tlie bottom, take out 
nearly all the inside; pound four ounces 
of bbnched filberts, mix them with ei^ht 
spoonfuls of apricot marmalade, which 
mixture put into the raadelaines, and place 
tlie slice taken from the bottom, and aerve 
tliem. 

MAITRE D'HOTEL, (X)LD. Put a 

quaiter of a pound of butter into a saooepan, 
with some parsley and shalbts, minced small, 
salt, whole pepper, and lemon-juice; mix 
ijie whole together with a wooden spocn. 
Pour the Maitre fTHotel either over, un- 
der, or into whatever meat or fish you in* 
tend to serve.

MARCHPANE ROYAL. Take a 
povid of sweet afanonds, blanch and throw 
them into cold wa^r, drain and pound them, 
moistening with orange-flower and plain 
water, hot take care not to put too much at 
once. The ahnonds being reduced to a 
paste, put than into a preserving pan with 
naif a poand of powder susar, set the pan 
on a moderate fire to dry the paste, which 
will be sufficiently so if, wiien you touch it, 
it no longer sticks to your fingn*, then take 
it out and place it on a plate or wafer paper, 
previously Bprinkled witli sugar: as soon as 
It is cold cut it in pieces, which roll in your 
hand to the size of your little finder ; form 
them into rings, and lay them on iron gtut- 
ii^, gfaze and put them into a brisk oven 
to color. The above paste may also be em- 
pkyed as follows: roll it out and cnt it in 
half, spread over one piece apricot manna* 
lade, or any other preserve you please, cover 
it with the other piece, cut it into lozenges, 
crescents, &c., according to yorar fiuicy, lay 
them on the grating as above, glaze and co- 
lor them in a quick oven. 

MARJORAM, SWEET, TO PRE- 
SERVE. Beat np very ^vell the white of 
an egg, then beat very fine and sifl some 
double-refined sugar; take some marjoram 
and rub it on a glass that is quite clean, and 
by it in the form of the gbss ; so do it with 
tlieegg, then sear it with the sugar on it, and 
lay it oo papor to dry. 

MARMALADE. Marmalade may he 
composed of almost any fruits; the best, 
however, for this porpose are, apricots, peach- 
es, oranges, quinces, ec^g-phinis, appl^, &c. 
Tli^ are usually made by Imiling llie fruit 
and sugar together to a kind of pulp, stir- 
ring them constantly whilst on the fire; it is 
kept in pots, which must not be covered till 
the n&rmalade is quite cold. The propor- 
tion of si^ar is half a poand to each pound 
ofiimit.

MARROW BONES. Chop the bones 
at eadi end so as to stand steady, then wash 
tbiem dean, saw them in halves, cover the 
top with a floored cloth: boil them, and serve 
with dry toast. 

MATELOTE MEAT. Take beef, veal, 
matton, and pork, a large slice of each, and 
asmalloneof legof lanril>; cut them in small 
pieces, which put into a saucepan with equal 
quantities of stock and champaign, salt and

MEAD. (1) To every galkm of water 
pot four pounds of. hooey, boil it an boor. 
Then put it into a tub with some yeast on a 
toast ; cover it over. If it ferments well af- 
ter three or four days, draw it oflT clear, and 
pot it into a cask, with one lenvNi sliced to 
every gallon ; add a bottle of brandy to eve- 
ry ten gallons. The rind of Seville orangea 
cut very thin, suspended in the bnrrd, is a 
great improvement to the flavor. It is best 
to wash the cask round with part of tha 
brandy, before the liquor is put in. 

MEAD. (2) Onepartofhonesrisdissolv* 
ed in three parts of water, and boiled over a 
moderate fire till it is reduced to two-thirds 
of the quantity. It is then skimmed, an4 
put into a bairel, which must be quite full; 
It is allowed to subside for three or four 
days, and tlien drawn ofi* for use. To make 
it firom tlie combs fitxn which honey has beea 
drained, they are to be beaten in warm wa- 
ter, and afler the liquor has subsided, it is 
to be strained. The cottagers in Scotland 
make an excellent beer by adding a little 
yeast to the strained liquor, and allowing it 
to ferment, for a few days, in a cask, and 
then bottling it. 

MEAT CAKES. Take whatever meat, 
game, or poultry, you may diance to have, 
(it is tlie better for being under-done) ; mince 
it fine, adding a little mt bacon or ham, or 
anchovy; season with a little peppor and 
salt ; mix the whole well together, and make 
it into small cakes, about three inches iu 
loigth, an inch and a half in width, and half 
an inch thick ; fi^ them of a light brown, 
and serve thorn with good gravy; or put it 
into a mould, and boil or bake tt. 

MEAT, TO KEEP HOT. If your 
meat is done before you are ready to serve, 
take it up, set the dish over a pan of boiling 
water, put a deep cover over it, so as not to 
touch the meat, and then put a cloth over 
that. This way will not diy up the gravy.

MINCED (X)LLOPS. This is a fe- 
vorite Scotch dish ; few families are with' 
out it: it keeps well, and is always ready to 
make an extra dish. Take beef, and chop 
and mince it very small ; to which add some 
salt and pepper. Put this, in its raw state, 
into small jars, and pour on the top some clar- 
ified butter. When intended for use, put the 
clarified butter into a fi-ying-pan, and slice 
some onions into the pan, and fry them. Add 
a little water to it, and then put in the minced 
meat. Stew it well, and in a few minutes 
it will be fit to serve up. See CoUops. 

MINCE MEAT. Two pounds of beef 
suet, picked and chopped fine ; two pounds 
of apple, pared, cored, and minced ; three 
pounds of currants, washed and picked ; cme

pounds of ready-dressed roost beef, fi^ fitHn 
skin and gristle, and chopped fine; two nut- 
megs, grated; one ounce of salt, one of 
ground ginger, half an ounce of coriander 
seeds, half an ounce of albpice, half an ounce

to the quantity you require. N. B.—The same 
weight of tripe is fi^uently substituted for 
the meat, ana sometimes the yolks of eggs 
boiled hard. Ob». — ^The lean side of a Ixit-

MUSHROOMS, TO CHOOSE. The 
muBbroami pn^iwr to be used ia cookery 
grow ia the open pasture lands for thoie that 



grow near or under trees, aro poisonous. 
The eatable mushrooms first appear very 
small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. 
They grow very rapidly, and the upper part 
and stalk are white. As they increase in 
size, die under part gradiully opens, and 
shows a fi'inged fiir of a very fine salmon co- 
lor, which continues more or less till the 
mtishroom has gained some size, and then 
turns to a dark brown. These marks shouki 
be attended to, and likewise wlieUier the 
skin can be easily parted from the edge 
and middle, and wliether they have a pleas- 
ant smell. Those which are poisonous have 
a yellow skin, and the under part has not the 
clear flesh cofor of the iieal mushroom ; be* 
sides which, they smell rank and disagreea- 
ble, and the fiir is white or .yellow. 

MUSHROOM KETCHUP. If you 

love good ketchup, sentle reader, make it 
yoiui«lf,> after the following directions, and 
you will have a delicious relish for made- 
dishes, ragouts, soups, sauces, or hashes. 

Mushroom gravy approaches the nature 
and flavor of meat gravy, more than any vege- 
table juice, and is die superlative substitute 
for it: in mea^ soups and extempore gra- 
vies, the chemistry of^ the kitchen has yet 
contrived to agreeably awaken the palate, 
and encourage the appetite. 

A couple of quarts of double ketchup, 
made according to the following receipt, 
will save you some score pounds of meat, 
besides a vast deal of time and trouble ; as it 
will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce 
as can be made for either fish, flesh, or fowl. 

I believe the following is the best way oT 
extracting and preparing the essence of 
mushrooms, so as to procure and preserve 
their flavor for a considerable length of time.- 

Look out for mushrooms fi'om the begin- 
ning of September. 

Take care they are the right sort, and 
iiesh gathered. Full-grown flaps are to be 
preferred: put a layer of these at the bottom 
of a deep earthen pan, and spi'inkle them 
with salt; then another layer of mushrooms, 
and some more salt on than ; and so on al- 
ternately, salt and mushrooms: let them re« 
main two €x three hours, by which time the 
salt will have penetrated the mushrooms, and 
rendered them easy to break; then pound 
them in a mortar, or mash them well with 
your hands^ and fet them remain for a couple 
of davs, not longer, stirring them up, and 
mashing them well each day ; then pour them 
into a stone jar, and to each quart add aa 
ounce and a half of whole black pepper, and 
half an ounce of allspice; stop the jar veiy 
dose, and set it in a stewpan of boiling wa^ 
ter and keep it boiling for two hours at leasts

squeezing the niiuhrooins) into r clean stew- 
pan; let it boil very gently for half an hour: 
those who are for superlative ketchup, will 
continue the boiling till the mushroom-juice 
it reduced to half the quantity ; it may then 
be called double cat-sup or d(^-sup. 

There are several advantages attending 
this concentration ; it will keep much better, 
and only half the quantity be required; so 
you can flavor sauce, &c. without thinning 
It: iieiilier is this an extravagant way of 
making it, for merely the aqueous part is 
evaporated ; skim it well, and pour it into a 
clean dry jar, or jug ; cover it close, and let 
it stand in a cool place till next day ; i then 
pour it off as gently as possible (so as not to 
disturb the settlings at the bottom of the 
jug,) through a tamis, or thick flannel bag, 
till it is perfectly clear ; add a table-spoon- 
fiil of good brandy to each pint of ketchup, 
and let it stand as before; a fi'esb sediment 
will be deposited, from which the ketchup is 
to be quietly poured off, and bottled in pints 
or half pintH (which have been waslied witii 
brandy or i^irit): it is best to keep it in 
such quantities as are soon used. 

Take especial care that it is closely cork- 
ed, and sealed down, or dipped in bottle ce- 
ment. 

If kept in a cool, dry place, it may Jle 
preserved for a long time ; but if it he Iratdlv 
corked, and kept in a damp place^ it will 
eoon spoiL 

Examine it from time to time, by plac- 
ing a strong light behind the neck of Uie 
bottle, and if any pellicle appears about it, 
boil it up again with a few pepperconis. 

MUSHROOMS TO PICKLE. Cut 
/off the stalks, and wash clean, in cold wa- 
ter, some small button mushrooms ; rub them 
wilii a bit of flannel, tlien throw them into 
fresh water, and when perfectly clean, put 
them into a saucepan with fresh cold water, 
and let them boil eight or ten minutes ; strain 
joff the water, lay them into tlie folds of a 
doth. Boil, in a quart of vinegar, a quaiter 
of an ounce of pepper, the same of allspice, 
fuid two or three blades of mace, and a tea- 
jspoonful of salt ; put the mushrooms into a 
jar, and when the vinegar is cold, pour it, 
with the spices, over them. 

MUSHROOMS TO STEW. For a 
good-sized dish, take a pint of white stock, 
seawMi it witlisalt, pepper, and a little lemon 
pickle, thicken it with a bit of butter rolled 
m flour; cleanse and peel the mushrooms, 
Bprinkle them witli a very little salt, boil 
them for thi^eeor fijur minutes, put them into 
the grav]^ when it is hot, and stew them for 
fifteen mioqies* 



MUSTARD. Mix (by deeraes, by n^ 
bmg toffetlier in a mortar) the best ikiiir of 
mustard, with vinegar, white wine, or cold 
water, in which scraped horwradish has 
been boiled ; nib it well together for at least 
ten minutes, till it is' perfectly smooth; it 
will keep in a stone jar closely stopped, for ft 
fortnigtit : only pot as much into the mnstard* 
pot as will be used in a day or two. 0^,^^ 
Mustard is the best of all the stimolftiitB that 
are employed to give ener^ to the digestive 
organs. Some opulent, epicures mix it with 
Sheny or Madeira wine, or distilled or fla- 
vored vinegar, instead of horseradish water. 
The Fi-ench flavor their mustard with Qiam- 
paigne and other wines, or with vinegar fla* 
vored with capers, anchovies, tarragon, elder, 
basil, hornet, garlic, eschalot, or celery,. 
warming it with cayenne, or the various 
spices; sweet, savory, fine herbs, truffles,, 
ketchup, &c. &c., and seem to ocmsider 
mustard merely as a vehicle of flavors. 

MUSTARD IN A MINUITE. Mfac 

very gradually, and rub together in a mortar, 
an ounce of flour of mustaxd, with three ta* 
ble-spoonfuls of milk (ci'eam is better), half 
a tea-«poonful of salt, and the same of sugar ;- 
rub them well together till quite smooth.. 
Obs. — Mustard made in this manner is not' 
at all bitter, and is therefore instantly readjy 
for the table. 



MUTTON. (1) The pipe that nMwaiong' 
the bone c^ the inside of a chine of mutton- 
ought to be taken away ; and if it is to be- 
kept any length of time, the part close roond 
the tail should be rubbed with salt, previously 
cutting out the kernel. 

It is best for the botcher to take cot the 
kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg,. 
as that is the part most likely to become 
tainted. The chine and rib-bones shoald be 
wiped every day ; and the bloody part of the 
neck be cut off, in order to preserve it. The 
brisket changes first in the breast; therefore,, 
if it is to be kept, it is best, should the 
weather be hot, to rub it with a little Rait 

When intended for roasting, it ^HNild hang: 
as long as it will keep, the hind quarter 
particularly; but not so long as to become 
tainted. 

Mutton for boiling ought not to hang 
long, as it will prevent its looking of a good 
color. 

The greatest care should be taken to pre- 
serve, by paper, the fat of what is roasted. 

MUTTON. (2) As beef requires a large» 
sound fire, mutton must have a brisk wid 
sharp one. If you wish to have muttoa 
tender, it should be hui^ ahnott as long aa 
it will k^ep; and dm ^od eight40otb, t. e.

The leg, baimch, and saddle will be die 
better for beiiig hung up in a cool airy place 
for four or five days at leaAt; in temperate 
weatho', a week ; in eold weather, ten days. 

A Legf of eiffbt pounds, will take about 
two hours: let it be well bairted, and frothed. 

A Chine or Saddle, (u e, the two bins) 
of ten or elevoi pounds,* two hours and a 
half: it is the business of the butcher to Uike 
off the skin and skewer it on again, to defend 
the meat firom extreme heat, and presene its 
succulence; if this is neglected, tie a sheet 
of paper over it (baste the strings you tie it 
on with directly, or they will bum) : about a 
quaiter of an hour before you think it will 
be done, take off the skin or paper, that it 
may get a pale brown color, then baste it and 
flour it lightly to froth it. N. B. Desire 
die butcher to cut off the flaps and the tail 
and chump end, and trim away every part 
that has not indisputable pretensions to be 
eaten. This will reduce a saddle of eleven 
pounds weight to about six or seven pounds. 

A Sktmider, of seven pounds, an hotur and 
a half. Put the spit in close to the eliank- 
bone, and run it along the blade^bone. 
Ji, B. The blade-bone is a &vorite luncheon 
or supper relbh, scored, peppered and salt- 
ed, and broiled, or done in a Dutch oven. 

A Ltoin, of mutton, from an hour and a 
half to an hour and three-quarters. The 
iDoet elegant way of carving this, is to cut it 
lengthwise, as you do a saddle. N. B. Spit 
it on a skewer or lark spit, and tie Uiat on 
the common spit, and do not spoil the meat 
by running the spit tlirough the prime part 
of it. 

A Neck, about the same time as a loin. 
It must be carefully jointed, or it is \ery 
difficult to carve. The neck and breast are, 
in small families, commonly roasted toother ; 
the cook will then crack the IxMies across the 
middle before they are put down to roast: if 
this ia not done carefoUy, they are very 
trouUesome to carve. Tell the cook, when 
she takes it from the spit, to separate them 
before she sends them to table. N. B. The 
best way to spit this is to run iron skewers 
acrosB it, and pot the spit betwera them. 

A Breast, an hour and a quarter.

MUTTON, BREAST, ROASTED 
WITH WiitK. Skin and bone a breast of 
mutton, then roll it op in a collar like a

half a pint of red wine ; when you have used 
up all the wine, finish basting with butter. 
Have a little good gnivy in readiness, and 
wlien the mutton is done, set it upright in a 
dish, pour in the grai^, |H«pare sweet same 
the same as for venison, and send it up to 
table without any garnish. 

MUTTON BROTH. Out a neck of 

matton into pieces, preserving a handsome 
piece to be served up in the tureen ; put all 
into a stewpan with three quarts of cold beef 
stock, or water, with a little oatmeal mixed 
in it ; some turnips, onions, leeks, celery cut 
in pieces, and a small bunch of thyme and 
panley. When it boils, skim it clean, bjoA 
when nearly done, take out the piece you in- 
tend to serve in the toreen, and let the other 
pieces stew till tendor ; then have ready tur- 
nips cut into dice, some leeks, celery, half a 
cabbage, some parsW, all cut small, and 
some marigolds; wash them, strain the li- 
quor off the meat, skim it fi«e from tlie fat, 
add it to the ing^redients with the piece of 
mutton intended for the tiveen, adding a lit- 
tle pearl barley. Season with salt, simmer 
all together till done, and serve with toasted 
bread on a plate. 

MUTTON CHOPS. Cut the chops 
off a loin or the best end of a neck of mutton, 
pare off the fat, dip them into a beaten e%^, 
and strew over them grated bread, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, and some finely minced 
parsley ; fry them in a little butter, and lay 
them upon the back of a sieve to drain be- 
fore the fire. Thicken about half a pint of 
gravy, add a tablenspoonful of ketchup, and 
one of Port wine ; put the gravy into the dish, 
and lay in the chops; garnish with fried 
parslqr or cut lemon. 

MUTTON CHOPS, BAKED. Oit a 
neck of mutton into neat chops, season them 
with salt and pepper, butter a dish, lay in 
the chops and pour over them a batter made 
of a quart of milk, four eggs beaten up, four 
table-spoonfiils of floor, and a little salt. Al

each into a piece of well-buttered paper; 
broil them over a clear fire, turning tliem of-

MUTTON CUTLETS. Cut into cut- 
lets a pound and a half of the thick part of 
m leg of mutton, and beat them ; mix with 
grated bread crumbs, some pepper, salt, and 
nnely chopped parsley, lemon tliyme, and 
sweet marjoram. Rub the cutlets witli melt-

MUTTON FILLET, STEWED. Put 
a fillet of mutton or a piece of beef, weigh- 
ing about seven pounds, into a stewpan, with 
a carrot, a tuniip, an onion stuck with two 
or three cloves, and a pint of water. Put 
round the edge of the stewpan, a rim of 
coarse paste, that the cover may be kept 
v&ry close, and let it stew gently, three hours 
and a half; take out the meat, ekim off the 
&t, 8ti*ain and thicken the gravy, have ready 
some boiled carrots and turnips cut to fancy, 
add tliem to the gravy, make all hot, and

MUTTON CUTLETS Breaped and 
Broiled. Trim and season your cutlets 
with pepper and salt, put them into some 
melted batter, and when they have imbibed 
a sufficient quantity of it, take them out, and 
cover them completely with brrad crumbs ; 
give the cutlets a good shape, and broil them 
over a clear fire ; take care not to do the cut- 
lets too much, to bm'n the bread. 

MUTTON GRAVY FOR VENISON 
OR Hare. The best gravy for venison is 
that made with the trimmings of the joint: 
if this is all used, and you have no undressed 
venison, cut a scrag of mutton in pieces ; 
broil it a little brown ; then put it into a 
clean stewpan, with a quart oi boiling wa- 
ter; cav&c it close, and let it simmer gently 
for an hour: now uncover the stewpan, and 
let it reduce to three-quarters of a pint; pour 
it thrcHugh a hair-sieve ; take the &t off, and 
send it up in a boat. It is only to be sea- 
aoned with a little salt, that it may not over- 
power the natoral flavor of die meat. 

MUTTON, TO HASH. Cut the meat 
into thin stioes, trim off all the aiiiews, skin. 



sristle, &c. ; pat in nothing but what k to 
be eaten, lay them on a plate, ready ; pi^ 
pare your sauce to warm it in, put in flie 
meat, and let it simmer gently till it is tfaor* 
oughly warm: do not let it boil, as that wiQ 
make the meat toog^ and hard, and it wiQ 
be a harsh, instead of a hash. Select lor 
your hash those parts of the joint that are 
least done. Hashing is a mode of cookefy 
by no means suited to delicate stomachs: 
unless the meat, be cfuisiderably under-done 
the first time, a second dressing must spoO 
it, for what is done enough the fiirst tune, 
must be done too much the second. 

MUTTON HAM, TO CURE. Cut a 

hind quarter of good mutton into the shape o[ 
a ham, pound one ounce of saltpetre, with 
one pound of coarse salt and a quarter of a 
pound of brown sugar, rub the ham -well wi^ 
this mixture, taking care to stuff the bole of 
the shank well witli salt and sugar, and let 
it lie a fortnight, rub|)ing it well with the 
pickle every two or three days ; then take 
It out and press it with a weight for one 
day ; smoke it with saw-dust fen* ten <»- fif- 
teen days, or hang it to dry in the kitchen. 
If the iiam is to be boiled soon after it has 
been smoked, soak it one hour, and if it has 
been smoked any length of time it will re- 
quire to be soaked several hours. Put it oo 
in cold water, an'd boil it gendy two hours. 
It is eaten cold at break&st, luncheon, or 
supper. A mutton ham is somedmes cored 
with the above quantity of salt and sugar, 
with the addition of half an ounce of pepper, 
a quarter of an ounce of cloves, and one nut- 
meg. 

MUTTON HAUNCH, LIKE VENI- 
SON. Take a fat haundi of large fine 
mutton, let it hang a week, then pound 
one ounce of black, and one ounce of Jamai- 
ca pepper, and rub them over the mutton, 
pour a bottle of Port wine over it, and let it 
remain in this five days, basting it frequent- 
ly every day with the liquor, talce it oat md 
Dane it up four or five days more, or as kng 
as the weather favors its keying; wipe H 
three or four times a day with a dean clodi. 
While it is roasdng baste it with die liquor 
it was steeped in, adding a little mcnre Port 
wine; a quarter of an hour before taking it 
firom the fire, baste it well widi butter, and 
dredge flour over it to froth it up. Serve it 
with sauces as for venison.

take a pound and a half of k>in of mutton, 
and simmer it in a pint of water till reduced 
tolKilf, use no seasoning but salt: brown it 
with a little burnt sugar, and serve it up in 
tile dish ; but there should be a good deal of 
gravy in the meat, for though long at the fire, 
the covering and distance will prevent its 
roasting oat. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. 

MUTTON LEG. (1) If your leg 
of mutton is roasted, serve with onion ur 
currant-jelly sauce ; if it is boiled, serve with 
eaper-eauoe and vegetables. In roasting or 
boiling, a quarter of an hour is usually allow- 
ed for each pound of meat. 

MUTTON LEG. (2) Cut off the shank 
bone, and trim the knuckle, put it into luke- 
warm water for ten minutes, wash it clean, 
cover it with cold water, and let it simmer 
very geatly, and skim it carefiilly. A leg 
of nine pounds will take two and a half or 
three hours, if you like it thorou^ly done, 
eq^ecially in very cold weather. 

The tU-bitt with an epicure are the 
*' knuckle," tlie kernel, called the 
eye" and the " geniUmanU" or 
b(me." 

When mutton is very large, you may di- 
vide it, and roast the fillet, i. e. the mrge 
emi, and boil the knuckle end; you may 
also cut some fine cutlets off the thick end 
of the leg, and so ha^e two or three good 
hot dinners. 

The liquor the mutton is boiled in, you 
may convert into good soup in five minutes, 
> and Scotch barley broth. Thus managed, a 
I^ of mutton is a most economical joint. 

MUTTON LEG STUFFED. Make 
a stuffing with a little beef-suet chopped, 
Mfne parsley, thyme, marjoram, a utile

some oyster-liquor, a little red wine, an an- 
chovy, and some more oysters stewed, and

MUTTON LOIN. Roast it; some 
people think it eats much better if cut length- 
ways like a saddle. It may also be used 
for steaks, pies, or broth, only taking care 
to cut off as much fat as possible. 

MUTTON LOIN, STEWED. Bone 

and skin the loin; stew it in a pint of 
water, tuiiiing it frequently; when the li- 
quor is half wasted, take out tlie loin and 
strain it, and when cold take off the &t; 
make a rich highly-seasoned gravy of the 
bones; strain and mix it with the liquor the 
loin was stewed in; add a tea-cupful of 
Port wine, and some small mushrooms; 
thicken the sauce witli bolter rolled in flour; 
put in the mutton, and heat it thoroughly; 
garnish with pickles. 

MUTTON NECK. (1) This joint is 
particularly useful, as so many dishes may 
be made of it. The bone ought to be cut 
short. 

The best end of the neck may be boiled, 
and served with turnips; or if you think 
proper, it may be roasted, or dressed in 
steaks, or made into pies, or used for harrico. 

You may stew the sci'agB in broth ; or in 
a litde water, with small onions, some pep- 
percorns, and a small quantity of rice, all 
served together. 

When you wish that a qeck which is to 
be boiled mould look particularly well, saw 
down the chine bone, strip the ribs half 
way down, and chop off the ends of the 
bones, about four inches. 

To make the fat look particularly white, 
the skin should not be taken off till it is 
boiled. 

The &t belonging to the neck or loin of 
mutton, if chopi^d very fine, makes a most 
excellent suet^xiddiog, or crust for a meat 
pie. 

MUTTON NECK. (2) Put four or 
five pounds of the best end of a neck (that 
has beoi kept a few days) mto as much ookr 
sofl water as will cover it, and about two 
inches over; let it simmer very slowly for 
two hours: it will look most delicate ii yoa 
do not take off the skin till it Ium been boil-

AS Vkvisoit. Take a fiit loio of motloii, 
and let it hang for Beveral days, then bone it. 
Beat it well with a rolling pin; then rub 
ten pounds of meat with a quarter of a pound 
of sugar, and pour over it one glass of Port, 
and one glass of vin^ar. Let it lie for five 
days and five nights ; after which, wash and 
wipe the meat very dry, and season it highly 
witli Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. 
Lay it in your dish, and to ten pounds put 
one pound of butter, spreading it over the 
meat. Put a crust round the edge of the 
disl), and cover with a thick crust, otherwise 
it will be over-done before the meat is soak- 
ed; it must be baked in a slow oven. 

Put tlie bones in a pan in the oven, with 
just sufficient water to cover them, and one 
glass of Port, a small quantity of pepper and 
salt ; by this means you will have a little rich 
gravy to add to the pasty when drawn. 

Sugar gives a greater shortness to meat, 
and a better flavor than salt, too great a 
(|uantity of which hardens the meat. Sugar 
is quite as great a preservative*

NOYAU. (1) Peaches and nectarines, 
in equal quantities, are to be bruised, the 
stones broken, and the k^nels bhmched and 
bruised ; they are then to be put into a jar 
in layers, one of fruit, one of kernels, and 
one of pounded loaf sugar, and so on until

OAT CAKES-«re nrnde in the same 
manner as muffins, using sifted oatmeal in- 
stead of flour, and three oallons of water iiw 
stead of two: pull the dou^h into pieces, 
roll and finish the cakes as directed for muf- 
fins. When wanted, pull the edges apart, 
toast them nicely on ooth sides, and then 
open them completely; lay in small pieces 
of butter, until you have as much as you may 
v.-ant; close them again, set them bef(we 
the fire, and cut each in halves or quarters, 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. BoU some 
water in a saucepan with a little salt, and 
stir oatmeal into it with a thevil ; whoi of 
a proper thickness, let it boil for four or 
five minutes, stirring it all the tinie; thai 
pour it into a dish, and serve with it creaai 
or milk. It is sometimes eaten with porter 
and sugar, or ale and sugar. If made with 
milk instoid of water, lees meal is requisite, 
and it is then eaten with oold milk.

OLIVE ROYAI^. Boil one pound of 
potatoes, and when nearly cold rvh than 
perfectly smooth with four oonoes of flour 
and one ounce of butto*, and knead it to- 
gether till it become a paste; roll it out 
about a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into 
rounds, and lay upon one side any sort of 
cold roasted meat cut into thin small bits, 
and seasoned with pei^aer and salt; pot a 
▼ery small bit of batter over it, wet the 
edges, and close the paste in the form of a 
half circle. Fry them in boiling fiesh drip- 
ping of a light brown color ; lay them be- 
fore the fire, cm the back of a sieve, to drain. 
Serve them with 'or without gravy in the 
dish. For a change, mince the meat, and 
season it as before directed. The potatoes 
should be very mealy. 

OLIVES. There are three sort?, the 
Italian, Spanish, and French; they may 
be had of various sizes and flavors, some 
prefer one sort, and some another. 

The fine salad oil is made tram this fruit, 
for which purpose they are gathered ripe; 
for pickling they are gathered when only 
half ripe, at the latter end of June; they are 
put into fresh water to soak for a couple of 
days; after this they are thrown into lime- 
vtrater, in which some pearl-ashes Iiave been 
dissoh'ed ; in this liquor they lie for six and 
thirty hours ; they are then put into w^ter 
which has had bay-salt dissolved in it; this 
is the last preparation, and they are sent 
over to us in this liquor; they are naturally, 
as they grow on the tree, extremely bitter, 
and therefore all these preparations are ntic- 
essai^ to bring them to their fine flavor. To. 
some olives they add a small quantity of es- 
sence of spiced, which is an oil drawn fix>m 
cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and 
sweet fennel-seed distilled together for that 
purpose; twelve di-opp are sufficient for a 
bushel of olives; some prefer them flavored 
with this essence. 

OMELETS AND VARIOUS WATS 

OF DRKSSIN6 Eggs. There is no dish 
which may be considered as coming under 
the denomination of a made dish of the sec- 
ond order, which is so gen«^lly eaten, if 
good, as an omelet; and no one is so oflen 
badly dressed: it is a very faithfol assistant 
in the construction of a dinner. 

When you are taken bj- siu*pri8e, and wisli 
to make an appearance beyond what is pro- 
vided for the every-day dinner, a little port- 
able soup melted down, and some zest and a 
few vegetables, will make a good broth ; a 
pot of stewed veal warmed up ; an omelet ; 
and some apple or lemon firitters, can all be 
got ready at ten minutes notice, and with 
the original foundation of a leg of mutton, or 
a piece of beef, witt make up a very good 



^linner when compuiy ooeipectedl^ aiii^m, 
in the country. 

The great merit of an omelet i8» that it 
should not be greasy, burnt, nor too brkIi 
done: if too nnich of the white of the eggs m 
left in, no art can prevent its being hara, if 
it is done: to dress the omelet, the fire 
should not be too hot, as it is an dbject to 
have the whole substance heated, withoqt 
much bit>wning the outside. 

One of the great errors in cooking an om- 
det is, that it is too thin ; consequently, in> 
stead of feeling fiill and moist in the nxxith, 
the substance presented is little better than 
a piece of firied leadier: to get the omelet 
thick is one of the gi'eat objects. With re- 
spect to the flavors to hA mtroduced, these 
are infinite; that which is most common, 
however, is the best, viz. finely chopped 
parsley, and chives or onions, or eschaJots; 
however, one made of a mixture of tarragon, 
chervil, and parsley, is a very delicate va- 
riety, omitting or adding the onion or chives. 
Of die meat flavors, the veal kidney is the 
most delicate, and is the most admired fay 
the French: this should be cut in *dioe, and 
should be dressed (boiled) before it is added; 
in the same manner, liam and anchovies, 
shred small, or tongue, wiU make a veiy 
delicately flavored dish. 

The objection to an omelet is, that it is 
too rich, which makes it advisable to eat 
but a small quantity. An addition of some 
finely masiied potatoes, about two taUe- 
spoonfuls, to an omelet of six ^;gs, will 
much lighten it. 

Omelets are often served with rich gra- 
vy ; but, as a general principle, no substance 
which has been fi*ied should be served in gra- 
vy, but accompanied by it, or what ought to 
eat dry and crisp, becomes soddened and 
flat. 

In Uie compounding the gravy, great care 
should be taken tliat we flavor does not over- 
come that of the omelet, a thing too little 
attended to : a fine gravy, with a fla vorii^ 
of sweet herbs and onions, we think the best ; 
some add a few drops of tarragon vin^ar; 
but this is to be done only with great core: 
gravies to omelets are in general thicken- 
ed: this should never be done with floor; 
potato starch, or arrow-root, is the best. 

Omelets i^ould be fi-ied in a smaH fty- 
ing-pan made for that purpose, with a smaH 
quantity of butter. Tlie omeletis ^"eat 
merit is to be thick, so as not to taste of the 
outside ; therefore use only half the nrnnber 
of whites that you do yolks of eggs : every 
care must be taken in fiying, even at 1M 
risk of not having it quite set in the middle: 
an omelet, which has so much vogue 
abroad, is here, in general, a thin doubM- 
up piece of leath^ , and harder tlian soft 
let^lther sometimeB. The foct is^ that as mnob

The following receipt ie the baeia o[ all 
CHoelets, of which ^ou may make an end- 
less variety, by taking, instead of the pars- 
ley and eschalot, a portion of. sweet herbs, 
or any of the articles nsed for making foroe- 
meats, or any of the forcemeats. 

Omelets are called by the name of what 
is added to flavor them: a ham or tongue 
omelet; an anchovy, or veal kidney ome- 
let, &c. : these are prepared exactly in the 
same way ba in the first receipt, leaving out 
the parsley and eschalot, and mincinf the 
ham or kidney very fine, &c., and oading 
that in the place of them, and then pour over 
them all sorts of thickened gravies, sauces, 
&c.

drachms of parsley, a good clove of eschalot 
minced very fine ; beat it well up with the 
eggs ; then take four ounces of fresh butter, 
and break half of k into large bits, and put 
it into the omelet, and the other half into 
a very clean fiying«pon ; when it is melted, 
pour in the omelet, and stir it with a spoon 
till it b^ins to set, then turn it up all round 
the edges, and when it is of a nice brown it 
is done: the safest way to take it out is to 
put a plate on the omelet, and turn tlie pan 
ppeide-down: sei've it on a hot dish; it 
should never be done till just vranted. If 
maigre^ grated cheese, shrimps, or oysters. 
If oystera, boil them four minutes, and take 
away the beard and gristly pait ; tli^ may 
eidier be put in whole, or cut in bits.

or sixteen oysters, seasoning them with a few 
peppercorns, strain and chop tliem; beat 
wdi six eggs ; parboil and mince a little 
parsley ; mix all t(^;ether, and season with a 
Uttle nutmeg, salt, and a table-spoonful of 
muduioom ketchup; fry it lightly in three 
ounces of butter, and hold it for a minute or 
two before the fire. 

OMELET. (3) Beat well and sU-ain six 
eggs; add them to three ounces of butter 
made hot ; mix in some grated ham, pepper,

taste, dien have nady mmm onion chopped 
small; put some butler into a fiyii9^)an,and 
whoi it is hot (but not to burn) put in voor 
chopped onkm, giving them two or three 
tivne; then add your eggs to it, and fry the 
whole of a nice brown, you mart only firy 
one side. When done, tnm it into a dish, 
the firied side oppenaost, snd serve. 

OMELET FRITTERS. Make two or 
three thin omelets, addii^ a little sweet ba- 
sil to the usual ^ingredients; cut them into 
small pieces and roll them into the form of 
olives; when cold, dip them into batter, or 
enclose them in puff paste; firy, and serve 
them with firied parsley. 

OMELET WITH KIDNEY OF 
VEAL. To eight welMwatan eggs, add a 
little salt, and part of a cold roasted kidney 
of veal, finely minced ; season with pepper, 
and a little more sah ; melt in a fniug-pan 
one ounce and a half of butter, and pour in 
the omelet ; fry it gently, and keep the mid- 
dle part moist ; wTien done, roll it equally 
upon a knife, and serve it very hot. 

OMELET AU NATUREL. Break 
eight or ten eggs into a pan, add pepper, 
salt, and a spoonful of cola water, bait tnem

fi^esh butter into a fiyinf[-pan, when it is quite 
melted and nearly boilmg, put in the egffs, 
&c. with a skimmer; as it is fi^'ing, take 
up die edges, that tliey ma^ be properly 
done; when cooked, double it; sene very 
hot. 

^ ONIONS. The small round silver button 
onions, about as biff as a nutmeg, make a 
very nice pickle. Take off their top coats, 
liave ready a stewpan, three parts filled wiUt 
boiling water, into which put as many cm- 
ions as will cover the top: as soon as tbev 
look clear, immediately take them up wiUi 
a spoon full of lioles, and lay them on a cloth 
tiiree times folded, and cover them with 
another till you have ready as many as ^•ou 
wisii: when they are quite dry, put tliem into 
jars, and cover them widi hot pickle, made 
by infusing an ounce of horseradish, same of 
allspice, and same of black pepper, and same 
of salt, in a quart of best white-wine vinegar, 
in a stone jar, on a trivet by the side of the 
fii^e for tiiree days, keeping it well closed; 
when cold, buns them down ti^t, and cover 
them with bladder wetted with the pickle 
and leather. 

ONIONS STEWED. The large Por- 
tugal onions are tlie best: take off the top- 
coats of half a dozen of tiiese (taking care

without laying them atop of one another, 
and juat oover them with sood broth. Put 
them over a slow fire, and let them simmer 
about two hoars; when you dish them, turn 
them upside down, and pour the sauce over. 

ONIONS TO PICKLE. Peel the onions 
till they look white; boil aomt strong salt 
and water, and pour it over them; let them 
stand in this twenty-firar hours, keeplhe 
vessel closely oovctm to retain the steam: 
after that time wipe the onions quite dry, 
and when they are cold, pour boiling vinegar, 
with ginger and white pepper over tbmi. 
Take care the vin^;ar always coven the 
onions. 

ONION SAUCE, YOUNG. Peel a 
pint of button onions, and put them in water 
till you want to put them on to boil; put 
them into a stewpan, with a quart of cold 
water; let them boil till tender; they will 
take (according to their sise and age) from 
half an hour to an hour. 

ONION SAUCE. Those who like the 
full flavor of onions onhr cut off the strings 
and tops (without peeling off any of the 
skins), put them into salt and water, and lei 
them lie an hour; tlien wash them, put them 
into a kettle with plenty of water, and boil 
them till they are tender: now skin them, 
pass them through a colander, and mix a 
little melted butt«r with them. N. B. Some 
mix the pulp of apples, or turnips, with the 
onions, others add mustard to them. 

ONIONS, TO PREPARE FOR SEA- 
SONING. Peel and mince three or four 
onions, put them into a saucepan with a lit-

ONIONS YOUNG, TO PICKLE. 
Chooae some oi the small silver onions, put 
them on in oold water, and when it is scald- 
ing hot, take them out with an egg slice ; 
peel off the skins till they kmk white and 
clear; lay them into the ibkb of a clotli. 
Boil, in a quart of vin^ar, half an ounce of 
pepper, a quarter of an ounc^ of allspice, the

finesh butter, pepper, and sak. 



ONIONS STEWED. (1) Taken 
of good<siied onions, peel and put them en 
in the following sauce: — A pint of veal stodL, 
a bit of butter rolled in ilour, a little pepper, 
and salt. Stew them gently for an hosr, 
and, just before serving, mix in three tabie- 
spoonfiils of cream. To stew them in a 
brown sauce, take die same quantity of good 
gravy. In a stewpan brown, of a light co- 
lor, a little butler and flour, add the gravy 
and onions, with a little pepper and salt, and 
stew them gently (me hour. 

ONIONS STEWED. (2) Peel 6ve or

or undressed meat, a slice of bacon, a little 
water, and some pepper. Cover tlie pan 
closely, and stew them till tender. Take 
out the bone and the bacon; thicken the 
sauce with a bit of butter rolled in flour. 

ORANGE BISCUITS. Take die grat- 
ed rind of an orange, six firesh ^gs, a 
quarter of a pound of flour, and three-quar- 
ters of a pound of powder sugar; put these 
into a mortar, beat them to a paste, which 
put into cases, and bake like other bis- 
cuits. 

ORANGE CHEESECAKES. To be 
made in the same way, as lemon cheese- 
cakes. 

ORANGE CREAM, FROTHED. Make 
a pint of cream very sweet, put it over the 
fire, let it just boil, put the juice of a large 
orange into a small deep glass, having pre- 
viously steeped a bit of orange-peel for a 
short time in the juice, when the cream is 
almost cold, pour it out of a tea-pot upon 
the juice, holding it as hi^ as possible. 

ORANGE CUSTARD. Having boiled 
the rind of a Seville orange very tender, beat 
it in a mortar to a fine paste; put to it the 
juice of a Seville orange, a spoonfiil of the 
best brandy, four ounces of loaf-sugar, and 
the yolks of (bur eggs ; beat them all wdl 
together ten minutes, then pour in b^ d ey i pcs

ORANGE FOOL. T^e the jaioe of 
BIX oranges, six ^ss well beaten, a pint of 
oeam, a quarter of a pound of sugar, a IKtle 
cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix all well tc^tli- 
er ; stir it over a slow fire till thick, then put 
io a smaU piece of batter, and keep stimng 
it till cokl. 

ORANGE GINGERBREAD. Sift two 
pounds and a quarter of fine fiour, and odd 
to it a pound and three-quarters of treacle, 
six ounces of candied orange-peel cut small, 
three-quarters of a pound of moist sugar, one 
ounce of ground ginger, and one ounce of 
a&pice: melt to an oil three-qtmrters of a 
potmd of butter; mix the whole well tc^th- 
er, and lay it by for twelve hoora; roll it 
out with as littke flour as possible, about 
half an inch thick; cut it into pieces three 
inches long and two wide; mark them in 
the form of checkers with the back of a 
kaife ; put them on a baking-plate about a 
quarter of an inch apart ; rab them over with 
a brush dipped in the yolk of an eg| beat up 
with a tea-cupful of milk; bake it in a cool 
oven about a quarter of an hour: when done, 
wad tlieitt slightly over again, divide tlie 
|ueces witli a knife (as in baking tiiey will 
run together). 

ORANGE LIQUOR. To each orange, 
oqe quart of strong spirits, and one pound 
and a quarter of loaf sugar are allowea; six 
or eight cloves are to be stuck into each or- 
ange, which, with the spirits and sugar, is 
to be put into a jar. It must be closely cov- 
ered, and stirred occasionally in the course 
of two montlis ; it is then to lie filtered dirough 
blotting paper, and bottled for use. 

Lemon liqucn* is made in tlie same way, 
nd)6tituting lemons for oranges. Instead of 
mixing tlie sugar with the other materials in 
the jar, it may be made into a sirup, and 
added to tlie strained or filtered spirits. 
This, though more troublesome, will be found 
a better method. 

ORANGE OR LEMON-PEEL, TO 
MIX WITH sTifFFiNG. Peel a Seville or- 
ange, or lemon, veiy thin, taking off only die 
fine yellow rind (witliout any of the white) ; 
pound it in a m<Hlar with a bit of lump su- 
gar; rub it well with the peel; by degrees 
add a little of the forcemeat it is to be mixed 
with: when it is well ground and blended 
with this, mix it witli the whole: there is 
no other way of incorporating it so well. 
Forcemeats, &c. are fi'equently spoiled by 
the insufficient mixing of the ingredients.

ORGEAT. (1) Pound very fine one 
pound of Jordan,, and one ounce of bitt^. 
almonds, in a mafi>le mortar, with half a giU 
of orange-fiower water to keep them fi^m 
oiling; then mix with them one pint of 
rose and one pint of spring-water; rub it 
tiirough a tamis ck>tb or lawn sieve, till the 
almonds are quite dry, which will reduce the 
quantity to about a quart : have ready three 
pints of clarified sugar or water, and boil it 
to a crack (which may be known by dipping 
your fingers into tlie sugar, and then into 
cold water ; and if you find the sugar to craok 
in moving your finger, it has boiled enough) ; 
put in the almonds; boil it one minute, and 
when cold put it into small bottles ck)ee 
corked; a table-spoonful of which will be 
sufficient for a tuihbler of water: shake the 
bottle before using. If the oigeat is for 
present use, the almonds may be pounded as 
above, and mixed with one quart of water, 
one quart of milk, a pint of capillaire <Mr 
clarified sugar, rubbed through a tamis or 
fine sieve, and put into decanters Ibr use. 

ORGEAT. (2) A quarter of a pound 
of sweet, and one ounce and a half of bitter 
almonds, are to be blanched, and thrown into 
cold water, tlien beaten in a marble mortar, 
and moistened occasionally with a spoonfiil 
of milk, to prevent their oiling; three pints 
of milk are then to be mixed gradually with, 
them, and after being sweetened, boiled, 
stirred till cold, and strained, a glass of wine 
or brandy is to be added. 

OVEN, DIRECTIONS FOR THE. 

Be very careful to keep your oven clean, and 
that there are no remains of susar or fat that 
may have run over from any thing that has 
been baking. Puff-pastes require a mode- 
rately hut oven, but not too hot, or it will 
spoil the shape and turn it over; tart-paste.

or idiort crust, requires a skiver oren ; pe- 
tits-bhoux, one still slower; Ixit ibr raised 
pies, let it be as hot as for puff-paste at fii^st, 
and well closed, so that tlie pics may not fall. 
Thcrefiire, when you give a dinner where 
paste is necesmi-y, endeavor to niake it in 
the morning; heat your oven first for die 
puff-paste, which must be baked the first; 
tiien let the oven go gradually down, and 
bake your pastes in rotation, as the heat 
fiills. Savoy biscuits require a cool oven, 
and, by degrees, raise the lieat as the biscuits 
are baking. For souffles or light puddings, 
have a gentle oven, and contrive so as to have 
them rea.(\\ by tlie time tliey are wanted, or 
tliey will mil. The gi'eatest attention sliould 
also be paid in lieating the oven for baking 
cakes, particularly for those tliat are large. 
If not prctty quick, tlie batter will not rise. 
Should you fear its catching by being too 
quick, put paper over the aike to prevent its 
being Iximt. If not long euougli liglited to 
have fi body of lieat, or if it has become 
Black, die cake will be bsavy. To know 
when it is soaked, take a broad bladed 
knife tliat is very bright, and plunge it into 
tlie centre ; di-aw it instantly out, and if die 
least stickiness adheres, put the cake imme- 
diately in, and sliut up the oven. If die heat 
ynui sufficient to raise, but not to soak, fresli 
fuel must be quickly fxit in, and the cokes 
kept hot until die oven is fit to finish die 
soaking, but diis must only be done in a case 
of gi^eat emergency ; for tiiose who are era- 
ployed ougtit to \je porticuharly careful diat 
no mistake occur from negligence. 

OX-CHEEK STEWED. Prepare diis 
tlie day before it is to be eaten ; clean it, and 
put it into suft water just warm; let it lie 
three or fcHir hours, Uieii put it into cold wa- 
tei', and let it soak alt night; next day wipe 
it clean, {Hit it into a stcwpan, and just cover 
it widi water ; skim it well when it is com- 
in^ to a boil, dien put two whole onions, 
stick two or diree cloves into each, Uiree 
turaiiM quartered, a couple of carrots sliced, 
two bay-leaves, and twenty-four corns of all- 
spice, a liesid of celery, and a bundle of 
sweet-lierbs, pepper, and salt; to diese, 
those who are for a " liaut gout " may add 
cayenne and garlic, in such proportions as 
tlie ixilute that reqtures -them may desire. 
Let it stew gently tdl perfectly tender, t . e. 
alx)ut three hours ; then take out the cheek, 
divide it into handsome pieces, fit to help at 
table ; skim, and strain die gravy ; melt an 
ounce and a lialf of butter in a stewpan ; stir 
into it as much fiour as it will take up; mix 
ivith it by degrees a pint and a half of the 
gravy; add to it a table-spoonful of basil, 
tarragon, or elder vinegar, or the like quan- 
tity of mushroom or walnut ketchup, or cav- 
ice, or Port wine, and give it a boil. 



OX CHEEK, TO BOIL. Wash very 
clean, half a liead ; let it lie in cold water 
all night ; breiik the lione in two, taking care 
not to break Ihe flesh. Put it on iu a pot 
of boiling water, and bt it boil fi-om two to 
Uiree hours; take out the bone* Serve iC 
with boiled carrots and turnips, or savoys. 
The liquor die head has been boiled in may 
be strained and made^into Scots barley brodi, 
or Scots kale. 

' OX FEET JELLY. Put a little hot 
water over die top of die stock, pour it olS, 
and wipe it dry with a clean cloth; put a 
quart of it into a saucepan with the beaten 
whites of five or six eggs, die juice of five 
lemons made very sweet with good brown 
sugar, a clove or two, and a Tittle cion- 
mon pounded; let it boil twenty miDotn, 
stirring it all the time ; take it off the fire, 
afid add a pint, or half a pint of white 
wine, and nm it through a jelly4]ag tifl 
clear. 



OX-TAILS STEWED. Divide 
into joints; wash them; parboil them; 
tliem on to stew in just water enou^ to 
cover diem, — and dress diem in the sane 
manner as we have directed in Stevied G9»- 
lets, for which they are an excellent suhsti* 
tute. 

OYSTERS. Some piscivorous goor- 
mands diink that oysters are not best w h en 
quite fresh from tlieir beds, and diat their 
flavor is too bi'ackish and liai:sh, and is nmdi 
anicliordted by giving diem a feed. 

To FEED oysters. — Cover them with 
clean water, witli a pint of salt to about two 
gidlons (notliing else, no oatmeal, floor, nor 
any other trumpery) ; this will cleanse them 
from the mud and sand, &c. of the bed; af- 
ter they have lafia in it twelve hours, change 
it for fresh salt and water, and in twelve 
hours more they will be in prime order for 
the moudi, and remain so two or three days: 
at die time of high water you may see them 
open dieir shells, in expectation of receiving 
their usual food. This process of fiseding 
oysters is only employed when a great many 
come up togetbo*. 

Cbmmon people are indifferent about the 
manner of opening oysters, and the time of 
eating them after di^ are opened ; nothing, 
however, is more important in the enlight- 
ened eyes of the experienced oysta*-eater. 

Those who wisn to enjoy this delicioai 
restorative in its utmost perfection, mmt 
eat it die moment it is opened, with its own 
gravy in the under shell ; if not eaten wbfle 
absolutely alive, its flavor and spirit are kwU 

Shell-nsh have long held a high rank in 
the catalogue of easily digestible and speedi- 
ly restorative foods; of these the oyster oer-

Uuoiy dowrves the beit character, bat we 
dunk it has acquired not a little mote repa- 
tatioa for these qiialitiee than it deaerves ; a 
weU-dreaaed chop or steak, will invigorate 
the heart in a miich higher ratio; to recruit 
the animal spirits, and support strenstb, 
ibere is nothing equal to animal food ; wlien 
kept till properly tender, none will give ao 
little trouble to the digestive organs, and so 
much subetantial excitement to the ooostitu- 
tion. 

OYSTER ATTELETS. Cut into smaU 
pieoes a sweetbread and a slice or two of 
jbaoon, beard some large oysters, and season 
all highly with chop{^ parsley, shallot, a 
little thvme, pepper and salt. Thai £uten 
them alternately upon wire skewers; put 
silted bread crumbs over them, and broil or 
fry them of a light brown color. Take them 
off the skewers, and serve them with some 
rich gravy, to which add a little ketchup and 
lemon pickle. 

OYSTERS, BAKED. Grate a small 
loaf of stale bread. Butter a deep dish well, 
and cover the sides and bottom wiib bread 
crumbs. Put in half tlie oysters with a lit- 
tie mace and pepper. Cover them with 
oumbs and small bits of butter strewed over 
them. Then put in the remainder of the 
oysters. Season them. Cover them as 
before with crumbs and butter. If the oys- 
ters are fresh pour in die liquor. If tliey 
are salt, substitute a little water. Bake it a 
very short time. 

OYSTERS, FRIED. (1) Make a batter 
as for pancakes, seasoned witlt grated nut- 
meg, white pepper, and salt, and add some 
finely grated br^d crumbs; dip in the oys- 
ters, and fry tliem of a light brown in beef 
dripping. 

Another way is, to dip tliem into the white 
of an C£g beat up, arid roll them in finely 
grated bread crumbs, seasoned with grated 
nutmeg, pepper and salt, and fiy them as 
directed. 

OYSTERS, FRIED. (2) The largest 
and finest oysters are to be chosen for this 
purpose; simmer them in their own liquor 
for a couple of minutes, take them out and 
lay them on a cloth to drain, beard them and 
then fiour them, egg and bread-crumb them, 
put them into boiling fat, and fry them a 
delicate brown. CX&s.-— An elegant garnish 
for made dishes, slewed rump-steaks, boiled 
or fried fiah, &c. j but they are too hard and 
dry to be eaten. 

OYSTERS, FRIED. (3) For flying, 
cboose the larg^ and finest oysters. Beat 
tone yolks of eggs, and mix ivith them grati 



ed liraad, and a ■nail qouticy ^ beala 
nutaoe^ and maoe, and a little salt. HaT* 
ing surred this batter well, dip your oym 
ters into it, and fry them in lard, till ihef 
are of a liglit brown color. Take care not 
to do them too much. Serve them op boC 
For grated bread, some Mibstituie crackers 
pounded to a powder, and mixed widi yolk 
of egg and spice. 

OYSTERS, TO KEEP AND FAT- 
TEN. Put them into water, and wash and 
clean diem with a birch broom ; layii^ them 
with tlie deep shell downwards into a tub or 
broad p}atter,and then sprinkle them over with 
salt. Tlie following day pour over them ancl 
fill the vessel with clean cold water, in which 
they must remain an hour, then pour it off 
again ; sprinkle them with salt, and let thw 
be rqjealed every day. This method will 
keep them good for a fortnight. 

OYSTER KETCHUP. (1) Take 
fine fredi oysters ; wash them in their own 
liquor; skim it; pound them in a raarUs 
mortar ; to a pint of oysters- add a pint of 
Sherry ; boil th^n up, and add an ounce of 
salt, two dracimis of pounded mace, and one 
of cayenne ; let it just boil up again ; skim 
it, and rub it through a sieve, and when cold, 
bottle it, cork it well, and seal it down. 

N. B. It is the best way to pound thesak 
and spices, &c. with the outers. 

i06«. — This composition very agreeaUy 
hei^iens the flavor of white sauces, ana 
white made-dishes ; and if you add a glass 
of brandy to it, it will keq) good for a 0(msi- 
derable time kmger than oystars are out of 
season. 

OYSTER KETCHUP. (2) Boil one 
hundred oysters with their liquor, till the 
strength be extracted firom them; strain them 
well, and add to the liquor an equal quanti- 
ty of wine, oae half Port and the other 
Sherry, also a quarter of an ounce of mace, 
the same of white pepper and of allspice, a 
drachm or tea-spoonful of ginger, and six 
anchovies; boil all together about fifteen 
minutes. Put into a jar twelve shaUots, the 
peel of a leiiKHi, and a pioc» of horse-radish 
cut small; pour upon them the boiling li- 
quor, and when cokl, bottle it, togedier with 
the spices. 

OYSTER LOAVES. Out off the top 
of some small French rolls, take out mo 
crumb, and firy them brown and crisp with 
clarified butter, then fiy some bread crumbs; 
stew the requisite quantity of oysters, beard- 
ed and cot in two, in their liquor, with a 
little white wine, some gravy, and seasoned 
with grated lemon-peel, pounded mace, pep« 
per, smd eaU} add a Int of butter; fiill tM

the fried bread cnudiw in the diah. 

OYSTER PATTIES. (1) Roll out puff 
fmste a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into 
squares with a knife, sheet eight or ten patty 
pans, put upon each a bit of bread the size 
Gf half a walnut; roll out another layer of 
paste of the same thickness, cut it as above, 
wet the edge of the bottom paste, and put 

^ on the top, pare them round to the pan, and 
notch them about a dozen times with the 
bank of the knife, rub them lightly with yolk 
of ^g, bake them in a hot oven about a 
quarter of an hour: when done, take a thin 
dice off the top, th«fi, with a small knife or 
spoon, take out the bread and the inside 
paste, leaving the outside quite entire ; then 
parboil two dozen of large oysters, strain 
them fi'om their liquor, wash, beard, and cut 
them into four, put them into a stewpan 
with an ounce of butter rolled in flour, half 

. a gill of good cream, a little grated lemon- 
peei, the oyster liquor, free from sediment, 
reduced by boiling to one half, some cayenne 
pepper, salt, and a teanspoonful of lemon- 
juice ; 'stir it over a fire five minutes, and 
fill the patties. 

OYSTER PATTIES. (2) Make some 
rich puff paste, and bake it in very small tin 
patty-pans. When cool, turn them out upon 
a large dish. Stew some large fresh oysters 
with a few cloves, a little mace and nutmeg, 
some yolk of egg boiled hard and grated, a 
little butter, and as much of the oyster liquor 
as will cover thmn. When they have stew- 
^ a little while, tsAie them out of tlie pan, 
and set them away to cool. When quite 
<x>ld, lay two or three oysters in each shell 
o{ puff-paste; 

OYSTER PIE. Beard a quart of fine 
oysters, strain the liquor, and add thsm to 
it. Cut into thin slices the kidney fat of a 
loin of veal; season them with while pep- 
per, salt, mace, and grated lemon-peel; lay 
them (Ml the bottom of a pie dish, put in the 
oystens and liquor, with a little more season- 
ing ; put over them the marrow of two bones. 
Lay a border of puff paste round the edge of 
the dish; cover it with paste, and beJLe it 
nearly tbrae-qunrten of an hour. 

OYSTERS, PRESERVED. Open 
the oysters carefiilly, so as not to cut them 
except in dividing oie gristle which attaches 
the shells; put them imo a mortar, and 
when you have got as many as vou can con- 
veniently pound at onoe, add about two 
drachms of ssdt to a dozen oysters; ponnd 
them, and rub them through the back of a 
hair sieve, and pot them into a mortar again, 
with as much flour (which has been pre- 



▼ioasly thoroughly dried) as will make them 
into a paste ; roll it out several tiroes, and, 
lastly, flour it, and roll it out the thicknes 
of a half-crown, and divide it into pieces 
about an inch square ; lay them in a Dutch 
oven, whore they will dry so gently as not to 
get burnt: turn them every half hour, and 
when they begin to dry, crumble them ; they 
will take about feur hours to dry; then 
pound them fine, sifl tliem, and put them 
into bottles and seal them over. 

N. B. Three dozen required seven and a 
half ounces of dried flour to make them mto 
a paste which then weighed eleven ounces; 
when dried and powdered, six and a quar- 
ter ounces. 

To make half a pint of sauce, put one 
ounce of butter into a stewpan with three 
drachms of oyster powder, and six table- 
spoonfuls of milk; set it on a slow fire; stir 
it till it boils, and season it with salt. 

This powder, if made with plump, juicy 
oysters, will abound with the flavor of the 
fish; and if closely corked, and kept in a 
' dry place, will remain good fur sometime. 

This extract is a welcome succedaneum 
while oysters are out of season, and in such 
inland paits as seldom have any, is a valua- 
ble addition to tlie list of fish sauces: it is 
equally good with boiled fowl, or rump steak, 
and sprinkled on bread and butter makes a 
very good sandwich, and is especially wor- 
thy the notice of country housekeepers, and 
as a store sauce for the army and navy. 

OYSTERS, TO PICKLE. Open them 
carefiilly, preserving all their liquor; put 
them into a saucepan over the fire, stirring 
them now and tlien, and when the liquor 
boils take tliem off, skim the surfece, and 
put the oysters into a bowl ; let the liquor 
settle, pour off the clear part, and put it on 
to boil, with, to three hundred oysters, half 
an ounce of whole black pepper,' a little 
mace and allspice ; boil it Um minutes, thai 
add the oysters, and let them boil two min- 
utes ; put them into a jar, and when they 
are cold, tie a paper over it. 

OYSTER SAUCE. When your oys- 
ters are opened, take care of all the liquor 
and give them one boil in it. Then bike 
the oysters out, and put to the liquor three 
or feur blades of mace. Add to it some 
melted butter, and some thick cream or 
rich milk. Put in your oysters and giv9 
them a boil. 

OYSTERSOUP. (1) ThreepHifsofiargs

upper to yoat taste, two table-cpooufiib of 
batter rolled in flour, and a bunch of sweet 
joarjoram and otiier pot-herbs. When it 
boils add a quart of rich milk— and as soon 
as it boils again take out the herbs, and 
put in the oysters just before you send it to 
table. 

OYSTER SOUP. (2) Boil in water die 
crumb of two twopoiny roUz), with a few blades 
of mace, a tea-spoonfiil of whole white pep- 
per, and four onions cut small. Pick out 
the spice, and rub the bread and onions 
through a liair sieve, then add it to three 
quarts of well-seasoned strong vesil stock. 
Rub down three ounces of butter, with a 
table-^KMinful of flour, and mix it giaduallv 
with Inilf a pint of Uie soup, and then stir all 
well together. Wlien it has boiled a sliort 
time, add with the liquor hal^ a hundred or 
more of fine oysters, and let tlie whole sim- 
mer for ten or fifteen minutes. If the soup 
is not quite salt enough with the liquor of 
the oysters, a little salt may be added. 

OYSTERS SCALLOPED. (1) Put 
diem, with their liquor strained, two or three 
blaules of mace, a few peppercorns, a little 
cayenne, and a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, kneaded with flour, into a stewpan. 
Simmer them very gently for half an hour, 
by no means letting them boil ; pick out the 
mace and pepper ; have ready, finely grated 
iHread-ciiimbs, seasoned with pepper and 
salt; put into the scallop-shells, or into a 
dish, alternately a layer of bread-crumbs, 
then one of oysters and part of their liquor; 
and stick over the last layer of bread<4:nunbB 
a few bits of butter, and brown them in a 
Dutch oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

OYSTERS SCALLOPED. (2) Take 
oflf the beards, stew them in their liquor 
strained, with a little mace, white pepper, 
and salt. Fry in a stewpan, with a bit of 
butter, some grated bread-crumbs, till of a 
nice tn^Mm; put them alternately with the 
oysters into a dish. 

OYSTERS SCALLOPED. (8) A 
good way to toarm up any cold fish. Stew 
the oysters slowly in their own liquor for two 
<»* three minutes, take them out with a spoon, 
beard them, and skim the liquor, put a bit 
of butter into a stewpan ; when it is melted, 
add as miich fine bread-crumbs as will dry 
it up, then put to it the oyster liquor, and 
give it a boil up, put the oysters into scal- 
E>p«hells that you have buttned, and strew- 
ed with bread-crumbs, then a layer of oys- 
ters, then of bread-crumbs, and then some 
more oysters; moisten it with the oyeiar li- 



iftor, cover them with braad-cnmibs, prt 
about half a dooen little bits of butter on the 
top of each, and brown them in a Dutoh ot- 
eo. Essence of anchovy, ketchi^, cayemie, 
grated lemon-peel, mace, and other spicesy 
&c. are added by those who prefer piquanoe 
to the genuine fttvor of the oyster. 

Cold fish may be re-dressed the same way. 
N. B. Small scalk>p-sbells, or saucers that 
hold about half a doien oysters, are the most 
convenient. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (1) Stew with 
a quart of oysters, and their liquor strained, 
a glass of white wine, one anchovy bruised, 
seasoned with white pepper, salt, a little 
mace, and a bunch of sweet herbs; let aU 
stew gently a quarter of an hour. Pick out 
the bunch of lierbe, and add a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter kneaded in a lai^ ta- 
ble-spoonful of flour, and stew lliem ten or 
twelve minutes. Serve them garnished with 
bi^ead-sippets and cut lemon. Tliey may be 
stewed simply in their own liquor, seasoned 
with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, and 
thickened with cream, flour, and butter. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (2) Open die 
oysters and strain the liquor. Put to them 
some grated stale bread, and a little pepper 
and nutmeg. Throw them into the liquor, 
and add a glass of white wine. Let tliem 
stew but a very short time, or diey will be 
hard. Have ready some slices of buttered 
toast wiUi tlie crust oflf. When the oysters 
are done, dip the toast in the liquor, and 
lay the pieces round the sides and in the 
bottom of a deep dish. Pour the oysters and 
liquor upon the toast and send them to ta- 
ble hot. 

OYSTERS STEWED. (8) Large oys- 
ters will do for stewing, and by some are pre- 
ferred. Stew a coopfe of dozen of these in 
their own liquor ; when they are coming to a 
boil, skim well, take them up and beard them ; 
strain die liquor through a tamis-sieve, and 
lay the oysters on a diw. Put an ounce of 
butter into a stewpan; wlien it is melted, 
put to it as much nour as will dry it up, the 
liquor of the oysters, and three table<spoon- 
fids of milk or cream, and a littfe white pep- 
per and salt ; to this some cooks add a little 
Ketchup, or finely-chopped parsley, grated 
lemon-peel, and juice; let it boil up for a 
couple of minutes, till it is smoodi, then take 
it oflf the fire, pot in the oysters, and let them 
get waim (tbcw tanut not themselves be boil- 
ed, or they wiU become hard) ; line die botf 
tom and sides of a hash-dish with bread- 
sippets, and pour your oysten and sawse 
into it.

PALATES AND SWEETBREADS. 
Boil die palates till the black akin can be 
eaiHly peeled off; parboil the sweetbreads 
with them; skin and cut the palates into 
pieces, and if tlie sweetbreads axe large, cut 
them in two the long way ; dust them witii 
flour, and fry them of a light brown, in but- 
ter; then stew them in rather more than a

OB« 

PANADA. (1) Boil SOUK pieces of stale 
bread in a sufficient quantity of cold water 
to cover them, with a Uttle cinnamon, lemon- 
peel, and caraways ; when the bread is quite 
soft, press out all the water, and beat up tlie 
breaid with a small piece of butter, a little 
milk, and susar to the taste; a little spice 
nmy be added. 

PANADA. (2) Set a little water on 
the fire with a glass of white wine, some su- 
gar, a vei^ little nutm^, and lemon-peel ; 
meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread : the 
moment the wat^ boils up, put in the bread- 
crumbs (without taking it off the fire), and 
let it boil as &st as it can. When of a 
proper consistence, that is, when just of a 
sufficient thickness to drink, take it off the 
fire. 

PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. Break 
three eggs in a basin ; beat them up with a 
little nutmeg and salt ; then put to them four 
ounces and a half of flour, and a little milk ; 
beat it of a smooth batter} then add by de- 
grees as much milk as will make it of the 
thidcness of good cream: the frying-pan must 
be about the size of a pudding plate, and 
Yei^ clean, or they will stick ; make it hot, 
and to each pancake put in a bit of butter 
about as big as a walnut: when it is melted, 
pour in the batter to covor the bottom of the 
pan; make them the thickness of half a 
crown; fry them of a light Ixrown on both 
aides. The above will do for ^iple fritters, 
by adding one spoonful nKH« <^ floor; peel 
your a{^e8, and cut them in thick slices; 
take out the core, dip them in the batter, 
imd fry tbefs ui hot isurd; pot them on a

Fry a thin pancake, turn it, and put into 
the middle two table^poonfiils of the minced 
veal ; fold it in at each side and at the endi 
in an oblong#form, and fry them of a li^ 
brovm color ; lav tliem upon the back m a 
sieve to drain before the fire. Four or sis

PANNEQUETS. Pot into a pan, two 
■■ inj i of sifted iloar, four erf* powder«ugar, 
dtt sane of bitter macaroons, and a spoon- 
fiil of dried orange-flowers; break up all 
these articles, and mix widi them the yolks 
often e^gs, four large glasses of double cream, 
and a pinch of sak. Wash the bottom of a 
fiyiog-pan lightly with some warm clarified 
batter, tfaeo put m it a spoonfiil of the above 
pfqMiFatioo, sfN^ead it over the pan, to make 
ibib paste as diin as possible; when die ptm-

roons on that, roll up the pannequet till about 
an inch in diameter ; in the meantime j)ut a 
second spoonfiil of your preparation into the 
pan, and proceed in the above manner, gar- 
■iflbingf one pannequet whilst another is 
oookii^; takinff care, however, to set the 
pan over a gentfe fire. When a\\ are done, 
cat the pamneqneU three inches in length, 
glaae»and dish them. 

PARSLEY. To preserve parsley duxHish 
the winter: — ^in May, June, or July, take 
fine fresh-gathered ^igs; pick, and wash 
diem clean ; set on a stewpan half ftill of wa- 
ter; pot a little salt in it; boil, and skim it 
dean, and then put in the parsley, and let it 
boil for a couple of minutes ; take it out, and 
kgr it on a sieve befiire the fire, that it may 
be dried as quick as possible; put it by in a 
tin box, aad keep it in a dry place: when 
you want it, lay it in a basin, and cover it 
vitb warm water a fiiw minutes before you 
it. 



PARSLEY BUTTER. Wash some 
panley very dean, and pick it carefiilly leaf 
ny leaf; put a tea-spoonfiil of sak into half 
a pint of boiling water: boil the parsley 
about ten minutes; drain it on a sieve; 
aunoe it quite fine, and then bruise it to a 
pulp. The deKcai^ and excdlenoe (^ this

PARSLEY, CRISP. Pick and wash 
yoang parsley, shake it in a dry cloth to 
drain the vmter from it; spread it on a sheet 
oi clean paper in a Dutch oven before the 
fire, and turn it fi^equently until it is quite 
crisp. This is a much more easy way of 
preparing it than firying it, which is not sd- 
dom 111 done. 

PARSNIPS, TO BOIL. Scrape and 
wash them nioelv ; when lai^, divide them ; 
boil them in milk and water till quite tender ; 
they will take nearly as long to boil as car- 
rots. They may also foe mashed like tur- 
nips. 

PARTRIDGES, TO CHOOSE. When 
they are young the bill is of a dark color,, 
and their legs are of a yellowidi color; and 
when fresh, the vent is firm, but this part 
will look greenish when stale. The plumage 
on the breast of the hen is light, that ontne 
cock is tinged with red. 

PARTRIDGES BROILED. Take 
five partridges, cut them in halves, trim and 
dip them in melted butter, and bread them 
twice ; a quarter of an hour before dinner 
broil them. 

PARTRIDGES MINCED. Take die 
filleta from eight roasted partridges, mince, 
and put them into a saucepan ; make a light 
rcuXy in which put the livers and lidits o^ 
the birds, a bay-leaf, a clove, three shallots, 
and a little sage, give them a few turns, and 
then add two large glasses of stock, reduce 
the sauce to half, strain and pnt \t to the 
mince, stirring till it is thick and smooth; 
make it hot, but not boiling; serve it over 
firied bread, and garnish your dish, with 
either poached or hard eg^. 

PARTRIDGE IN BREAD. Take a 
nice shaped loaf, of about a pound weight; 
make a Dole at one end, trough which tdke 
out all the crumbs, rub the crust over with a 
litde butter <x lard, and set it in die oven for 
a few minutes to dry: fill this with minced 
partridge (see that article), and put the loaf, 
bottom upwards, into a stewpan ; add two 
spooofiik of veal blond, with any other gar- 
nish you please ; let it remain on die fire till 
the bread is soft enough to allow a straw to 
penetrate it, then take it oat and dish it with 
the aauoe round.

four partridges, pick and magd them; cut 

otf their less at tne knee; aeason with pep- 
per, salt, chopped parsley, thynie, and inusb- 
rooms. Put a veai steak and a slice of ham 
at the bottom of the dish; put in the par- 
tridges with half a pint of good eoruomme. 
Line the edges of tne dish with puff paste, 
and cover with tlie same; do it over with 
egg, and let it bake for an hour. 

PARTRIDGE TO ROAST. Take 

out tlie entrails, and singe tlie partridge over 
tlie stove, tlien roll a bit of butter in pepper 
and salt, and put it into the inside of the 
bird ; truss it neatly with the head turned on 
cue side, keeping the breast as full as possi- 
ble ; over which should be laid slices of ftit 
bacon tied on with pack-thread ; before it is 
put on tile spit, break the back-bone, that it 
may lay the belter on the dish. A good 
sized partridge will take half an hour ; when 
nearly done, take away the bacon, brown 
the paitridge well ; sprinkle it with flour and 
.salt, and froth it with butter; serve it with 
water-cresses, a good gravy under it, and 
bread sauce in a boat. 

PARTRIDGE TO TRUSS. Let it be 
well picked and singed, then cut a slit in 
the back of the neck, and carefully take the 
erop out witiiout breaking it ; then cut off 
the vent, and draw out the inside; after tliis, 



well wipe tlie inside, abd then put in a little 

Eipper and salt, mixed with a bit of butter, 
aving cleansed it, proceed to truss the 



bird, by 6rBt cutting off the pinion at the 6rBt 
joint, so tliat the feathers need not be picked 
off that part; break the back-bone, and truss 
it in the same manner as a fowl, by pressing 
the legs close to tlie apron, tiien turn the bird 
on the breast, and run a skewer thi*oiigfa the 
end of the pinion, the leg, tlie body, and the 
leg and pinion on the other side, with the 
hNui fixed on the end of the skewer, and 
over the breast lay a slice of fat bacon, and 
tie it on with pack-thread. If for boiling or 
stewing, truss tliem the same as a fowl for 
boiling. 

PARTRIDGES TO STEW. Tmss 
the partridges as fowls are done for boiling; 
pound the fivers widi double the quantity of 
fat bacon and bread-crumbs boiled in milk; 
and some chopped parsley, th}'me, shalbts, 
and mushrooms ; season with pepfier, salt, 
grated lemon-peel, and mace. Stuff the in- 
side of tlie bu^s, tie them at both ends, and 
Kt them into a slewpon lined with slicei of 
oon ; add a quart of good stock, half a pint 
of white wine, two onions, a bunch c^ sweet 
herbs, and a few blades of mace ; let them 
stew gently till tender ; take them out, strain 
and thicken the sauce with flour and butter, 
make it hoC» and pour it over the partridgas. 



PASTE. Be w&ry partiate thai 

slab or paste table, roluitf-pin and 

are clean, and free from alTold paste, and b« 
very careful that both the floor and butler 
are extremely good. Have a dry sieve al* 
ways in reauliness, in or by the floor txAtf 
so as to use none without sifting it; for, 
though it may appear puce and fine, bran, or 
small particles of old paste may have fidlea 
into it; sifting is, therefore, always neces- 
sary. Weigh one pound of flour, lay it in a 
circle aa the slab: break one egg in theeen- 
tre, put a small quantity of sak, and a little 
bit of butter; mix all these together ligfathr, 
add a little water, mix them again, then add 
more water, and so proceed until it binds 
into pajste; but take <!are that you do not 
make it too stiff, nor squeeze it much an 
gether, till you find there is sufficient water; 
then werk it well together, and roll itoutoa 
the slab, but do not roll it t<x> thin ; work a 
pound of butter on ihe slab, spread it out Is 
the size of the paste, with a knife cot it off 
altogether, and lay it on the paste; then 
double the ends of the paste together, to ia- 
ck)ee the butter ; then give it one turn, thos: 
roll it out till you just perceive the butter 
dirough the paste; turn the end whidi is 
next to you half way over, and the other end 
over that, roll it once or twice with the roU* 
ing-pin ; then let it stand, this is called one 
turn; then, in three minutes time, turn it 
again, and so proceed until you have giveo 
it six turns; then roll it out, and cut it for 
patties or any shape you please ; but observe 
not to put over than too much egg, as dat 
will prevent their rising; as soon as thqf 
are baked, take them off the sheet, lay thest 
on paper, and when cold, scrape the bottoms, 
neatly cut out the insides ready for wfaal- 
evor you mean to put into them. For bak- 
ing, see directions for the oven.

must be used -when hot and fiedi baked. 

PASTE FOR BOILED PUDDINGS. 

Pick and chop veiy fine half a pound of beef 
suet, add to it one poond and a quarter of

put too much, as this paste must bo made as 
stiff as poflsiUe; when thoron^ly mixed, 
give it two or three turns, roll it and cut it 
out to the shape you want fer your pie. 
Sometimes the butter is melted in warm wa- 
ter, and so mixed with the flour; then it 
will not require so much water, and the 
paste will stand better; but as you work 
your paste, when you find it get too odd, 
warm it a little ; the first method of doing 
it is the best, if intended to be eaten.

PEARS PRESERVED. Take care 
in making this preeerre that the fruit be not 
too ripe; they are in a fit state as soon as 
tihe pips are black. Set the pears on the 
fire in a sofficient quantity of water to cover 
fhem; take them off when quite soft, and 
throw them into cold water; pare them 
Uffhtfy, cut off the stalks, prick each with a 
pin sufficiently k>n^ to reach the core, and 
pot them again mio cold water, with a 
handfiil of alum; set them on the fire to boil 
until the pearsare tender, then take them out. 
and pot them into cold water for the third 
time. Clarify and boil some sugar, put some 
water to it, and when it boils, suld the pears, 
cover the pan, and give the whole a boil; 
dLim and poor it into an earthen pan and 
leave it. The next day, drain Ihe sirup 
firom the pears, add a little more clarified 
si^ar to It, and boil it again ; poor it over 
thefiruit, and leave it as before; the next 
and two successive days, proceed in the same 
way, each time increasing the degree of 
boiling, then add the peturs, give the pre- 
serve a boil (covered), skim and pour it into 
a pan, and place it in a stove for two days, 
then drain the fruit, and put it by for use. 

PEARS STEWED. (1) Wash and prick 
some large stewing pears, and set them on 
the fire in a large stewing-pan of water to 
scald; when scalded, take them out, and 
pot them on the fire in a pan with a sufficient 
quantity of thin clarified sugar to cover them, 
a stick of cinnamon, a littR mace, and two 
or thre^ cloves; let them stew gently till 
th^ begin to soften and look lather red, 
then put in a bottle of Port wine, and let 
diem coiuinue stewing until 4)erfectly done, 
and look very rich and red ; tjien put them 
in a basin or jar, with the liqnKNr over th«n ; 
they will be all the better for Keeping four or 
five days. 

PEARS STEWED. (2) Pare, cut into 
quarters, and take out the core of six good 
baking pears; throw them as they are done 
into water. To a pound of firuit allow a 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and Uiree 
cbves; put them into a saucepan, cover 
them with cold water, keep the pan closely 
covered, and stew them gently, tiU red and 
tender; add, just before serving, a glass of 
Port wine. They may be eaten hot or ccid^ 
with cream, after dinner or at supper. 

PEAS, GREEN. Young green peas, 
well dressed, are among the most delicious 
delicacies of > the vegetable kingdom. They 
must be young; it is equally indispensable 

12* 



that they be fi«ih gathered, and cooked ai 
80(xi as they are shelled for they soon \om 
both their color and sweetness. After being 
shelled, wash them, drain them in a cullen- 
der, put them on in plenty of boiling water, 
with a tea-spoonfiil of salt, and one of pound* 
ed loaf si^ar; boil ihem till they become 
tendor, which, if youne, will be in less than 
half an hour ; if old, they will require mare 
than an hour; drain tHem in a cullender, 
and put them immediately into a dish with 
a slice of fresh butter in it; some people 
think it an improvement to boil a small bunch 
of mint with the peas; it is then minced 
finely, and laid in small heaps at the end or 
sides of the dish. If peas are allowed to 
stand in the water after being boiled they 
lose their color. 

PEAS FOR A SECONd CX)URSE. 
Put a quart of fine green peas, together with 
a bit ot butter tlie size of a walnut, into as 
much warm water as will cover them, in 
which let them stand for eight or ten min- 
utes. Strain off the water, put them into a 
saucepan, cover it„stir thein frequently, and 
when a little tender, add a bunch of parsley, 
and a young ooioo, nearly a dessert-spoonful 
of loafnBugar, and an ounce of butter mixed 
with a tea-spoonfiil of flour; keep stirring 
them now and then till the peas be tender, 
and add, if they become too thick, a iable> 
spoonfiil of hot water. Before serving, take 
out the onion and parsley. 

PEAS PUDDING. Take a pint of 
good q)Ht peas, and having washed, soak

PEAS POWDER. Pound together 
in a marble mortar half an ounce each of 
dried mint and sage, a drachm of celery- 
seed, and a quarter of a drachm of cayenne 
pepper ; rub them through a fine sieve. This 
gives a very savory relish to peas soup, and 
to water gmel, which, by its helf), if the 
eater of it has not the most lively imagina- 
tion, he may foney he is sipping good peas 
soup. Obs.— A cvachm of allspice, or black 
pepper, may be pounded with the above aa 
an addition, or instead of the cayenne. 

PEPPER POT. Take as much spinacli 
as will fill a good sized dish, put it in a

saooe. 

FERLINGO. Take a pound and a half 
of sifted flour, and having placed it on your 
slab, make a hole in the middle of it, into 
which put three-quarters of a pound of Ix-own 
mgar, half a pound of fi-esh butter, the rind 
of two lemons grated, and ten e^ ; knead 
all these ingredients together weU, until you 
have a pretty firm paste ; if it should be too 
thin, add a handfiil oMHpe flour. Then cut 
the paste into small pieces, each of which 
roll ra the palms of your hands, till they are 
die length and thickness of your finger ; take 
a round stick (about half the diameter of your 



paste), press thia down ott each af ik8 

pieces, so that they may be their orinml 
thickness on one side^ and thin on theouier; 
when aU are ihus pressed, form thera into 
little crowns (the flat side inwards, and dw 
thin end uppermost), lay them on white pa- 
per, and biake them in a moderate oven; ii 
the meanwhile, make some white sugar tu^ 
nish or icins, and when the perlingos an 
sufficiently (Lne, dip them carefiiliy in the 
varnish, one by one; then replace them in 
the oven, a minute or two, to dry. 

PERRY. Perry is a pleasant and whole- 
some liquor, made frqm the juice of pears,

PICKLE FOR M£AT« Six poondft 
of salt, one pound of sugar, and four ounces 
of saltpetre, boiled with four gaflnos of water, 
skimmed, and allowed to cool, forma a vary 
strong pickle, which will preserve any meat 
completely immersed in it. To eflect this, 
whi<:h is essential, either a heavy board or a 
flat stone must be laid upon the meat. Tbe 
same pickle may be used repeatedly, provided 
it be boiled up oocasionally witli additional 
salt to restore its strength, diminished by the 
combination of part of the salt with the 
meat, and by the dilution of the pid&le fay 
tlie juices of the meat extracted. By boiline, 
the albumen, which would cause tne pickle 
to spoil, is coagulated, and rises in tbe fonn 
of scum, which must be carefully removed* 

An H4x>ne, of ten or twelve pounds, 
weight will require about three-quartefa of a 
pound of salt, and an ounce of moist sqgnr, 
to be well nibbed into it. It wilt be ready 
in four or five days, if turned and rubbed 
everv day. 

llie time meat requu:es salting depends 
upon the weight of it, and how nmch salt ii 
used : and if it be rubbed in with a hearr 
hand, it will be ready much sooner than il 
only liditly rubbed. 

N. B. D17 the salt, and rub it with the 
sugar in a inortar. 

Pork requires a longer time to cure (■ 
proportion to its weight) than beef. A kg 
of pork should be in salt eight or ten dajfs; 
turn it and rub it every dav. 

Salt meat should be well washed before U

If boifecl» eapeckjly if it has been In wak 
kNv, that die liquor m niiicfa the meat is 
fwiled, may not be too salt to make soup of. 
If it lias been in salt a long time, and vou 
fear that it will be too salt, wadi it well in 
cold water, and soak it in luke-warm water 
for a couple of hours. If it is very tali, 
lay it in water the night before you intend to 
dre9 it. 

PICKLE FOR TONGUES. To foor 
^llons of water, add two pounds and a 
lialf of treacle, eight pounds of sah, two 
cHmcea of saltpetre ; boil it, and skim it un- 
til clear, sprinkle suit over the tongue, and 
let it stand two days, wipe it clean before 
you put it into die pickle, which must be quite 
cold; boil tlie pickle, every two or diree 
inooths, adding two or three handfuls of sah, 
skimming it well. Ilalf the quantity is suf- 
ficient for two tongues. 

PICKLE FOR BEEF. Allow to feur 
gallona of water two pounds of brown sugar 
and six pounds of salt, boil it about twenty 
minutes, taking oflftlie scum as it rises ; tKe 
following day poor it over tlie meat which 
hasbeen packed into Uie pickling-tub. Boil 
-k e^'ery two mondis, adding three ounces ^ 
brown sugar and half a pound of common 
salt. By tliis means it will keep good a 
year. Tlie n>eat must be sprinkl^ with 
ssdt, and the next day wiped dry, before 
pouring the pickle over it, with which it 
should always be completely covered. WiUi 
the addition of two ounces of saltpetre and 
one pound of salt, tliis pickle answers for 
pickled pork, hams, and tongues. The 
tongues sliould be ruUbed with common salt, 
to cleanse them, and afterwards with a little 
saltpetre, and allowed to lie four or five days 
beiore tliey are put into the pickle. Tbe-^ 
meat will be ready for use in eight or ten 
days, and will keep for three months. 

PICKLES. PickloB ought to be stored 
in a dry place and the vessels most approv- 
ed of for keeping them in, are wide-moutl^ 
ed ^lass bottles, or strong stone-ware iars, 
havmg corks or bungs, which must be fitted 
in widi linen, and covered with bladder or 
leather; and for taking the pickles out and 
r^uming Uiem to the jar, a small wooden 
i^won is kept. The strongest vinegar is 
osed for pickling; that of cider more partic- 
ularly recommended, but su^r vinegar will 
generally be found sufficiently strong. It is 
essentia] to llie excellence and beauty of 
pickles, tliat tliey be always completely cov- 
et^ with vinegar.

mortar some lemon-peel, with four ounce* 
of good moist sugar, and, if agreeaMe, add 
some quince jam; cover it wiUi puff paste; 
bake it an hour and a quarter. (Geoenllj 
eaten warm). 

PIE, APPLE. (2) Para, quarter, and 
core die apples; cut them mto ihin bits. 
Put into the bottom of a pie-dish a table- 
spoonful of brown sugar, with a tea-spoon- 
fol of grated ginger and lemon^ieel, then 
a laver of apples, and so on sikemateW, 
till the dish is piled as full as it will bold. 
The next day wet die rim of the didi, line 
it with puflf or tart paste, brush it with wa*» 
ter, and cover it with paste; press the edge 
all round, notch it with a paste-cutter, and 
make a small bole with die point of a knife 
in die middle. It may be seasoned with 
two table-spoonfuls of lemon or orange mar- 
malade, pounded cinnamon, mace, and 
cfoves, in addition to the ginger and lemon- 
peel. 

PIE, APPLE WITH MUSCADEL 
RAISINS. Peel twenty renneting apples, 
cut them in quarters, and then cut Mch quar- 
ter into five or six pieces; toss them in a 
pan with four ounces of sugar in powder, 
(over which should be grated the oeel of a 
lemon), four ounces of butter lukewarm, 
and four ounces of fine muscadel phims.

]|tete, and then pot in eighteen fine apricots, 
(cut in halves and the stones taken oat,) 
with four punces of sugar in powder, and 
^nir ounces of butter lukewarm. Then lay 
on the upper crust, elaze with the white of 
egSy ana strew sifted sugar all over. Let it 
bake in a moderate oven to a nice light col- 
or. Serve it hot. When you wish to serve 
it cold, you must leave out the butter. 

PIE, BEEF KIDNEY. Cut some kid- 
neys into thin slices, and place them in 
the bottom of your pie-dish, then sweet 
herbs chopped, such as parsley, thyme, shal- 
lots, mushrooms, pepper, and Kilt; con-

and bake it for an hour. It is a common 
but mistaken opinion, that it is necessary 
to pot stock or water into meat pies. Beef, 
mutton, veal, and pork, if not previously 
dressed, will be found to yield a sufficiency 
of gravy, and the pie will be better without 
any additional liquid. N. B. — Large oys- 
ters, pai*boiled, bearded, and laid alternately 
with the steaks, their liquor reduced and 
svibstituted instesul of tlie ketchup and wine, 
will be a variety.

side, lay a good puff-paste crust aQ over the 
dish, season the ducks both inside and out, 
with pepper and salt, and lay them in the 
dish, widi the giblets at each end, inropedly 
seasoned. Put in as mudi water as will 
nearly fill the pie, lay on the crust, and let it 
be well baked. 

PIES, EGG MINC^. BoH six eggs

and close it, and pinch it round the edge ; 
rub it over with yolk of eg^, and bake it two 
buufi with a paper over it, to prevent die 



cnist fifom burning. vVhen done, poor ill 
some good gravy, with a little ready-mixed 
nustard (if approved). N. B. — ^As the 
above is generally eaten ookt, it is an exod* 
lent rqpest for a joum^, and w9l keep for 
several days. 

PIE, POTATO. Peel and slice yoor 
potatoes very ihin into a pie-dish ; between 
each layer of potatoes pot a little chopped 
onion (three-quarters of an eonoe of onioo is 
sufficient for a pound of potatoes) ; between 
each layer sprinkle a little pepper and sah; 
put in a little water, and cut abofut two 
ounces of finesh butter into little bits, and Im 
them on the top: cover it cloee with puff* 
paste. It will take about an hour and a half 
to hake it. N. B. The yolks of four eggv 
(boiled hard) may be added; and what 
baked, a table-spoonful of good mushroom 
ketchup poured in through a funnel. 06*.— 
Cauliflowers divided into mouthfals, toad 
button onions, seasoned with eunry-poiftder, 
&c. make a fovorite vegetable pie.

saucepan, three-quarters of a pint of water,, 
and half a pound of good lard ; when the- 
water boils, make a hole in the middle oC 
tlie flour, pour in the water and lard by de> 
grees, gently mixing the flour with it with 
a spoon ; and when it is well mixed, the» 
knead it with your hands till it becomes stiffr 
dredge a little flour to prevent its sticking to 
the board, oryou cannot make it loc^ smoMir 
do not roll it with the rolling-pin, but rell k 
with your bands, about the thickness of a 
quart pot; cut it into six pieces, leaving a 
little for the covers; put one hand in the 
middle, and keep the other close on the out- 
side till you liave worked it either in an oval 
or a ixMind sliape: have your meat ready cut, 
and seasoned with pepper and sak : if poik, 
cut in small slices; the griskin is the best 
for pasties: if you use mutton, cut it in Tsiy 
neat cutlets, and put them in the pies as you 
make them; roll out the covens with the 
rolling-pin just the size of the pie, wet it 
round the ed^, put it on tlie pie, and prai 
it together with your thiunb and finger, and 
then cut it all round with a pair of scisson 
quite even, and pinch tliem inside and oat»

edges quite eveo, and pinch it round with the 
finger and thumb, rub yolk of egg over it with 
a paste-brush, and (Nrnaaient it in any way 
&ncy may direct, with the same kind of 
paste. Bake it of a fine brown color, in a 
8k>w oven; and when done, cut out the top, 
remove the flour or bran, brush it quite 
clean, and fill it up witlia fi-icassee of chick- 
en, rabbit, or any otlier entree most conve- 
nient. Send it to table with a napkin under. 

PIE, HAM RAISED. Soal^ a small 
ham four or five hours ; wash and scrape it 
well ; cut off the knuckle, and boil it for 
half an hour ; then take it up and trim it very 
neatly ; take off the rind and put it into an 
oval stewpan, with a pint of Madeira or 
Sheny, and enough veal stock to cover it. 
Let it stew fijr two hours, or till three parts 
done; take it out and set it in a cokl 
place ; then raise a crust as in the foregoing 
receipt, large enough to receive it; put in 
the ham, and round it the veal forcemeat ; 
cover and ornament; it will take about an 
hour and a half to bake in a slow oven: 
when done, take off the cover, glaze the top, 
and pour round the following sauce, viz. take 
the liquor the ham was stewed in ; skim it 
free froni &t; thicken with a little flour and 
butter mixed together; a few drops of brown- 
ing, and some cayenne pepper. 

PIE, SEA. Skin and cut into joints a 
hi^ge fowl ; wash and lay it into Cold water 
for an hour; cut some salt beef into thin 
slices, and if it is very salt, soak it a short 
time in water; make a paste of flour and 
butter in the proportion of half a pound of 
butter to one of flour, cut it into round pieces 
according to the size of the bottom of the 
pot in whidi the pie is to be stewed; rub 
with butter the bottom of a round iron pot, 
and lay in a layer of the beef, seasoned with 

Eipper, and finely-minced onioo; then pot a 
yer of the paste, and then the fowl, hi^Iy 
seasoned with pepper, onion, and a little 
salt; add another laver of paste, and pour 
is three pints of cola water; cover the pot 
dose^, and let it slew gently for nearly rour 
hours, taking care it does not burn, which, 
if neglected, it is apt to do. It is served in 
a pudding didb, and answers well for a femily 
dinner. 

PIE, SQUAB, OR DEVONSHIRE. 
Take a few good bakii^-af^les, paro, core, 
and slice tnem; chop some onions very 
small ; line a deep dish with paste, put in a

kin ; or baked in a plate. 

PIE, VEGETABLE. Of a variety of 
vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, pota- 
toes, artichoke bottoms, cauliflower, French 
beans, peas, and small button onions, equal 
quantities <^ each ; half boil them in good 
broth for a short time, put them iiUo a pie 
dish, cover it with puff paste, and bake it in 
a slow oven ; make a gravy of a bit of veal, 
a slice of ham , pepper, salt, a bay leaf, mush- 
rooms, shalbts, parsley, and an onion; whoi 
it has boiled thick, strain the liquor, and mix 
in three or four table-spoonfiils of cream, and 
pour it into the pie before being snrved. Tlie 
cream may be <«nitted. 

PIG, Is in prime order for the spit when 
about three weeks old. 

It loses part of its goodness every hour ai^ 
ter it is killed ; if not quite firesh, no art can 
make the crackling crisp. 

To be in perfection, it shouM be killed in 
the mmrning to be eaten at dinner: it requirea 
very carefiil roasting. A sucking-pig, like 
a young child, must not be left for an in- 
stant. 

The ends must have much more fire than 
the middle: for this purpose is contrived an 
iron to hang before the middle part, called a 
pig-iron. If you have not this, use a com- 
mon flat iron, or keep the fire fiercest at the 
two ends. 

For the stuffing, take of the crmnb of a 
stale k)efabout five ounces; rabittfaroq^a 
colander; mince fine a handfiil of nge (t. tf. 
about two ounces), and a large onion (about 
an ounce and a half). Mix these together 
with an egg, some pe|^per and sak, ana a bit 
of butter as big as an egg. Fill the belly of 
the pig with uis, and sew it up: lay it to 
the fire, and baste it with salad oil tUl it ia 



PIO 



144 



Fid 



doM. Do net leave it a moment: it 
nquires the most vigilant attendance. 

Roast it at a clear, brisk fire at some dis- 
tance. To gain the praise of epicurean pig- 
eaters, the cracklinsf must be nice^ crispml 
and (felicately lightly browned, without be- 
ing eidier blistered or burnt. 

A small, Uiree weeks old pig will be done 
enough in about an hour and a half. 

Before you take it from the fire, cut off the 
bead, and part that and the body down the 
middle: chop the brains very fine, with some 
boiled sage leaves, and mix them witli good 
veal gravy, or beef gravy, or what runs from 
the pig when you cut its head off. Send up 
a tureenful of gravy besides. Currant sauce 
is still a favorite with some of the old school. 

Lay your pi| back to back in the dish, 
with one half of tlie head on each side, and 
the ears one at each end, which you must 
take care to make nice and crisp; or you 
will, get scolded, and deservedly, as the silly 
fellow was who houglit his wife a pig witn 
only one ear. 

When you cut off the pettitoes, leave the 
skin long round the ends of the legs. When 
you first lay the pig before the fire, rub it all 
over with fi*esh butter or salad oil: ten 
minutes after, and the skin looks dry; 
dredge it wett with flour all over, let it re- 
main on an hour, then rub it off with a soft 
cloth. 

N. B. A pig is a very troublesome subject 
to roast; most persons have them baked. 
Send a quarter of a pound bf butter, and beg 
the bak^ to baste it well. 

PIG, BAKED. Lay your pig in a dish, 
flour it well all over, then rub it over with 
batter ; butter the dish you lay it in, and put 
it into the oven. When done enough, take 
it out, and rob it over with a butter cloth; 
then put it again into the oven till it is dry, 
then take it out and lay it in a dish ; cut it 
up, take a little veal gravy, and take off the 
fat in the dish it was baked in, and tliere 
will be some good gravy at the bottom ; put 
that to the veal gravy, with a little bit of but- 
ter, rolled in flour; boil it up, and put it in 
a dish in which the pig has been had', and 
pot the brains with some sage into the belly. 
Some persons like a pig to be brought to 
table whole, in which case you are only to 
pat what sauce you like into the dish. 

PIG, BARBICUED. Scald, &c., a pig, 
of about nine or ten weeks old, the same as 
for roasting; make a stuffing with a few 
sageJeaves, the liver of tlie pig, and two an- 
chovies boned, washed, and cut extremely 
small ; put them into a mortar, with some 
bread-crumbs, a quarter of a pound of butter, 
»/«py little cayenne pepper, and haJf a pint 
of Madeira wine; beat them to a paste, and 



■ew it op m the pig; lay it at a good distance 
before a lai^ brisk fire; singe it weH; ^ 
two bottles of Madeus wine into the dnp> 
ping-pan, and keep basting it aH the time it 
18 roasting ; when half done, pat two FrewA 
rolls mto die drippingpan ; and if there is not 
wine enough in the drippingpan, add more: 
when the pig is nearly done, take the rob 
and sauce, and put them into a saucepan, 
with an anchovy cut small, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and the juice of a lemon ; take up dw 
pig, send it to table with an apple in its 
mouth, and a roll on each side ; then, strain 
the sauce over it. 

Some barbicue a pig of six or seven weda 
old, and stick'it all over with blanched al- 
monds, and baste it in the same manner widi 
Madeira wine. 

PIG, TO COLLAR. Cot oflf the feeL 
head, and tail; bone and wash it well, and 
dry it in a clodi. Season it highly with a 
quantity of pepper and salt; roll it up firmly, 
and bind it with a piece of linen ; sew it 
tiglitly. Put it on in boiling water, with the 
bones, let it boil for an hour, then put it im* 
der a weiglit to press till it be cold, and take 
off die cloth. 

PIG'S CHEEK, TO COLLAR. Strew 
over a pig's fece,and a neat's or pig's ton^ui^ 
a little salt and saltpetre ; let it stand ei(^ 
or nine days, then ooil tliem witht two cow- 
heels, till all be sufficiently tender to admU 
of the bones being taken out; lay upon a 
dish a piece of strong cloth, put the cheek 
upon it with tlie rind downwards ; season it 
hidily witli pepper, cloves, and a little sah; 
add the tongue and cow-heels, with more 
seasoning ; roil and sew it up firmly, put it 
into a jar and boil it for two hours, then 
press it with a lieavy weight, and when ooU 
takeoff the cloth. .The cow-heel maybe 
omitted, and both cheeks used. 

PIG'S CHEEK, TO CURE. Strew 
salt over it, and let it lie two or three days, 
then pour over it the following mixture when 
it is cold; half a pound of \^y salt, half an 
ounce of sdltpetre, a quarter of a pound of 
coarse brown sugar, one handfol of common 
salt, and a penny-worth of cochineal, boiled 
in a pint of stron? beer or porter ; let it lie 
in the pickle a fortnight, tumin? it dadj, 
then hang it to smoke for a week. What 
to be dre^ed, put it into lukewarm wa^or to 
soak for a night, and in dressing it, ftdkm 
tlie directions given for boiling hams. 

PIG'S FEET AND EARS PICKLED, 
Wash the feet and ears very clean, and be-

diread, and roast it by a jack, or by a string. 
Or, serve in slices, with parsley, for a firy. 
Serve with a sauce of Port wine and water, 
and mustard, just boiled up, and put it into 
adidi. 

PIG'S HEAD COLLARED. Very 
nicely scour the head and ears ; take off the 
hair and snoot, and take out the eyes and 
brain ; let it lay for one night in water ; then 
drain it; salt it extremely well, with com- 
mon sak and sakpetre^and let it lie for five 
days. Boil it sufficiently to take out the 
bones; then lay it on a duresser, turning the 
thick end of one side of die head towards the 
Aide end of the other, to make the roU of an

of a couple of cow-heels. Put it into a ck>th, 
bind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite 
tender; then put it under a wei^t, and do 
not take off the covering until it is quite cold. 
If you wish it to be more like brawn, salt it 
longer, and let the propiMtion of saltpetre be 
greater, and put in also scmie pieces of lean 
poH(, and then cover it with cow-heel, to 
look like the horn. This may be kept either 
in or out of pickle of salt and water, boiled

pepper, salt, and nutmeg; place pait of the 
skin at the bottom of a potting-pan or bowl, 
lay in tiie chopped meat, and put the 'rest of 
tlie skin over tlie top; press it down hard, 
place a small plate upon it, put on that a 
heavy weight, which must not be taken <^

and let it stew till tender. 

PIGEONS. Pigeons should be extreme- 
ly fi*esh ; wlien so, and in good order, diey 
are plump and fat at the vent, and their feet 
pliable; but when they are stale, the vent is 
open, green, and widiered. Tame pigeons 
are considered preferable to the Wild.

they are limber-footed. In other respects, 
diooee them by the same marks as other 
fewls. There are diree sorts; the gray, 
grena, and bastard plover or lapwing. 

PLOVERS, TO DRESS. Green plov- 
ers should be dressed the same as wood- 
cocks, without drawing, and served on a 
toast. Gray ^Aovens should be stewed.— 
Make a forcemeat with the yolks of two 
hard eggs bruised, some marrow cut fine, 
artichoke botUxns cut small, and sweet 
herbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg: stuff the birds, and put than into a 
saucepan, with just a sufficient quantity of 
good gravy to cover them, one glass of 
white wine, and a blade of mace; cover 
them close, and let them stew vei^ gently 
till they are tender; then take vxp the pk>v- 
eiB, lay them in a dish, keep them hot; pot 
a piece of butter rolled in flour, to Uiicken 
the sauce, let it boil till smooth; squeeze 
into it a little lemon; skim it, and pour it 
over the plovers.. 

POINT DE JOUR FRITTERS. Mi*

two bay-leaves, a little tl^me, a dessert- 
noonfiil of fine white pepper, a glass oi 
vinegar, and a small quantity of butler; set 
the pao on the fire, and reduce the whole 



tin nearly all gone, when add two hdleMi 
of etpagiufk, and one of slock; reduoa 
these again to the proper coosisteooe, and 
strain it for use. ^ 

PORK. Dairt-fkd porit m the bvt; 
the flesh shoukl kmk white and smooth, and 
the fot be white and fine. In preparing a 
bog for baooo, the ribs are cot, with a very 
little flesh on them, from the side, which 
has the fore and hind leg attadied to it; 
the hind leg is then called a gammon of ba- 
con, but it is generally reserved for a ham. 
On each side there is a large spare rib, 
which is usually divided into two, one call- 
ed the sweet bone, the other the blade bone. 
There are also griskins,- chine, or back 
bone. 

Hog*s lard is the inner fiit of the baeoo 
hog. 

rorken are not so old as hogs; they 
make exoeUmi pickled pork, but are cho- 
sen mwe particularly for roasting. 

To roast a leg, a small onion is minoed 
together with three sage leaves, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, and put under the 
skin at the knuckle bone; the skin is cut 
into strips nearly half an inch apart, and 
nibbed over with a bit of butter. If weir- 
ing seven or eight pounds, it will require 
nearly three hoturs to roast. 

A spare nb should be roasted, is basted 
with buttor, and has sage leaves dried, rub- 
bed to a powder, and mixed with salt and 
pepper, sprinkled over it. 

Both a loin and neck are jointed, the 
skin 8C(Nred in narrow strips, and rubbed 
witli butter. If weighing six or seven . 
pounds, it will require rather more than two 
notuvto roast. 

A griskin may be either broiled or roast- 
ed. 

A chine is stufled here and there with 
bread crumbs, mixed with a little butto*, 
and seasoned with some finely shred sage, 
parsley, and thyme, some pqiper and salt. 
The skin is cut into stripe and rubbed with 
butter; it is then roasted, and served with 
apple smice, as ai'e also the preceding 
roasts. 

A porker's head is stufled like a sucking 
pig, sewed firmly, and hung on a string to 
roast. 

The shouMer may be roasted, but, being 
very fot, it is generally preferred pickled. 

The breast may be made into a pie, or 
broiled. 

To boil hams, they should be put on in 
water, the chill taken off, and simmered for 
four or five hours, taking care not to allow 
them to boil. 

The prime season for pork is from No- 
vember to March. 

Take partknilar care it be done enough:

Itssravy has me least tint c^ rediwn. 

Bie carefol of the crackling; if this be 
not carisp, or if it be burned, you will be 
scolded. Pickled Pork, takes Inore time 
than ai^ other meat. If you boy your pork 
ready saltied, ask how many dajrs it has 
been in sak; if many, it will reouire to be 
soaked in water fix* six hours oefore you 
dress it. When you cook it, wa^ and 
scrape it as clean as possible; when deK- 
cately dressed, it is a favorite dish with a^ 
most everybody. Take care it does not 
boil fturt ; if it does, the knuckle will- break 
to pieces, before the thick part of the meat 
is warm through; a leg of seven pounds 
takes three hours and a half very slow sim- 
mering. Skim your pot very careful^, and 
when you take the meat out of the boiler, 
scrape ic clean. 

A leg of nice pork, nicely saked, and 
nicely boiled, is as fine a cold relish as cold 
ham; especially if, instead of cutting into 
the middle wti^ hot, and so letting out 
its juices, you cut it at the knudde: slices 
broiled are a good luncheon, or supper* 

Jllinfi.—<Some persons who sett pork ready 
salted have a siHy trick of cutting the knue- 
kleintwo;we suppose that this is dbne to- 
save their sak; mt it lets all the gravy ont 
of the leg; and unless you boil your pork 
merely for the sake of die pot-liquor, vimich 
in this case receives all the goodness and 
strength of the meat, friendly reader, your 
oracle cautions yon to buy no leg of pork 
which is siit at the knuckle. 

^ If pork is not dooeenough, nothing is more 
disagreeable ; if too much, it not only loses 
its color and flavor, but its sobstaikoe be- 
comes soft like a jelly. 

It must never appear at table without pan- 
nips; tliey are an excdilent v^etable, and 
deserve to be much soore popular; or carrots,

monds), about a quarter of an inch apait; 
sfiuflf the knuckle with sase and onion, minced 
fine, and a little grated bread, seasoned with 
pepper, salt, and the yolk of an egg. 

Do not put it too near the fire : rub a litde 
sweet oil on the skin with a paste-brush, or 
a goose-^ther: this makes the craoklin? 
crisper and browner than basting it with 
dripping; and it will be a better color than

A proper bald spare rib of cfi;riit pomir 
weiglit (so called because almost sul the meat 
is fered oflT), with a steady fire, will be done 
in an hour and a quarter. There is so little 
meat on a bald spare rib, that if you have a 
large, fierce fire-, it will be homed belbre if 
is warm throv^. Joint it nicely, and crack 
the ribs across as you do ribs of kunb.. 

When you put it down to roast, dosC ov 
some flour, and baste it with a little butter; 
dry a dozen sage leaves, and rubtbeas diroiKb

POT 



< POTATOES. The vegetable kingdon 
affiNnds no food more wholeeome, more easily 
procured, easily prepared, or lets expensive, 
tiian the potato : yet, althou^ this most usefiil 
^WgetaUe is dressed almost every day, in 
almost every fiunily, for (xie plate of potatoes 
that comes to tsdble as it should come, ten are 
spoiled. 

Wash them, but do not pare oir cut them, 
mless they are very large. Fill a saucepan 
half foil of potatoes of equal size (or make 
them so by dividing the loiter ones), put to 
them as much cold water as will cover them 
about an Inch: th^ are sooner boiled, and 
more savory, than when drowned in water. 
Most boiled things are spoiled by imviiig too 
little water, but potatoes are often 8|>oiie(i by 
too much : they must merely be covered, and 
a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that 
they may be just covered at the finish. 

Set them on a moderate fire till thev boil ; 
then take them off, and put them by the side 
of the fiire to simmer slowly till they are soft 
enough to admit a fork (place no dependence 
on the usual test of their skins' cracking, 
which, if they ai'e boiled fost, will happen to 
some potatoes when they ore not half done, and 
the insides quite hard), llien pour the wa- 
ter off (if you let the potatoes remain in the 
water a moment after they are done enough, 
tbey will become waxy and watery), uncover 
the saucepan, and set it at such a distance 
from the fire as will secure it from buitiing; 
their superfluous moisture will evaporate, and 
the potatoes will be peifoctly dry and mealy. 

You may afterward place a napkin, folded 
up to the size of tlie saucepan's diameter, 
over the potatoes, to keep them hot and 
mealy till wanted. 

This method of managing potatoes is in 
every respect equal to steaming them ; and 
th^ are dress^ in half the time. 

There is such an infinite variety of sorts 
and sizes of potatoes, that it is impossible to 
say how long they will take doing: the best 
way is to try them with a fork. Moderate- 
sized potatoes will generally be done enough 
ia fifteen or twenty minutes. 

FOTATOES, NEW. The best way to 
dean new potatoes is to rub them with a 
coarse cloth or flannel, or scrubbing-brush. 

New potatoes are poor, watery, and insip- 
id, till tliey are foil two inches in diameter: 
they are not worth the trouble of boiling be- 
fore midsummer day. 

068. Some cooks prepare sauces to pour 
over potatoes, made with butter, salt, and 
pepper, or gravy, or melted butter and ketch- 
up; or stew the potatoes in ale, or water 
fleasoned with pepper and salt ; or bake them 
with herrings or sprats, mixed with layers 
of potatoes, seasoned with pepper, salt, sweet 
herbs, vinegar, and water ; or cut mutton or

POTATO BALLS. Mix mashed pota. 
toes with the yolk of an egg ; roll them into 
balk; flour them, or egg and bread-crumb 
them ; and fry them in clean drippings, or 
brown them in a Dutch oven. 

POTATO BALLS RA(K)UT, Are 

made by adding to a pound of potatoes a 
quarter of a pound of grated ham, or some 
sweet lierbs, or chopped parsley, an onion or 
eschalot, salt, pepper, and a little grated 
noting, or other spice, with the yolk of a 
couple (^ wgs : they are then to be dressed 
as Potato Balls. 

Oba, An agreeable vegetable relish, and 
a good supper-^lish. 

POTATOES BOILED, TO BROIL. 
After boiling potatoes not quite sufficiently to 
send to table, put them on a gridiron over a 
clear fire, and turn them fireqoently till they are 
of a nice brown color all over; serve them 
hot; take care thev do not become too hard, 
as that spoils the flavor. 

POTATOES, CASSEROLE. Boil and 
peel some ^ood mealy potatoes, pound them, 
and mix with them some butter, cream, and 
a little salt, put them about an inch and a 
half hiffh upon a flat dish, and leave an open- 
ing in die centre ; bake them of a light brown 
c(jTor, and take out as much from the centre 
as will admit of a ragout, fi'icassee, or mac- 
aroni, being put into it. 

POTATOES, (X)LCANNON. BoU 
potatoes and greens, or spinage, separately ; 
mash the potatoes; squeeze the greens diy; 
chop them quite fine and mix them with the 
potatoes, with a little butter, pepper, and 
salt; put it into a mould, buttering it well 
first; let it stand in a hot oven for ten min- 
utes. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. When 
boiled and peeled, allow four large mealy 
potatoes, half their weight of butter and of 
pounded loaf sugar, two eggs beaten, half 
the grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt; 
pound the potatoes in a mortar witli the 
other ingnredients; beat the yolks of four 
eggs ; roil up the croquettes ; dip them into 
tlie beaten eggs, and roll them in sifted bread 
crumbs; in an hour, roll them again as be- 
fore, aiid Cry them in butter; put them upon 
the back of a sieve before the fire to drain.

eggs or pears, roU them into a well-beaten 
egg» and then into grated bread seasoned, 
with pepper and salt ; fiy them in plenty of 
lard or dripping till they are of a fine brown 
color, lay them before the fire to drain; 
serve tliem with a fringe of fried parsley. 

POTATOES FRIED IN SLICES 
OR RIBBONS. Peel large potatoes; slice 
them about a quarter of an inch thick, or 
cut them in shavings round and round, as 
you would peel a lemon ; dry them well in a 
clean cloth, and fry tliem in lard or dripping. 
Take care that your fat and frying-pan are 
quite clean ; pdt it on a quick fire, watch it, 
and as soon as the lard boils, and is still, 
put in the slices of potato, and keep moving 
them till they are crisp. Take tliem up, 
and lay them to drain on a sieve : send them 
up with a very little salt sprinkbd over them. 

POTATOES FRIED WHOLE. When 
nearly boiled enou^, put tliem into a stew- 
pan with a bit of butter, or some nice clean 
beef-drippines; shake them about (^n (for 
fear of burnmg tliem), till tliey are brown 
and crisp; drain them from the fat. Obs. — 
It will be an el^ant improvement previous 
to frying or broilin? the potatoes, to flour

and then roll them in finc-siftod bread- 
crumbs ; tliey will then deserve to be called

POTATOES RAW OR COLD, TO 
FRY. Wash, peel, and put them into cold 
water for one or two hours, cut them into 
slices alx>ut half an inch thick, and fry them 
A light brown in boiling clarified beef suet. 
Cold boiled potatoes, cut in slices, may be 
done in the same manner. 

POTATO FRITTERS. Peel, and 
pound in a mortar, six mealy potatoes, with 
a little salt, a glass of white wine, some 
pounded sugar, cninamon, and an otmce of 
butter; roll it out with a little flour, cut 
them the size of a wine glass, and fry tliem 
in boiling clarified dripping. Serve them 
with sifted loaf sugar over tliem. 

POTATOES, MASHED. (1) When 
your potatoes are thoroughly boiled, drain 
them quite dry, pick out every speck, &c. and 
while hot, rub them through a colander into 
a clean stewpan. To a pound of potatoes 
put about half an ounce of butter, and a ta- 
ble-spoonful of milk: do not make them too 
moist; mix them wrll together. Obs. — 



When th6 (Mfatoes ftfe ^ing old and 
specky, and in fiposty weather, diis is dv 
faes^ way of dressing them. Yon may poc 
them into shapes or small tea-cup^; egg 
them with yolk of egg, and brown thiem very 
slightly before a slow fire. 

POTATOES, MASHED. (2) BoiltliB 
potatoes, peel and ma^ them very smoothly; 
put for a lai^ dish four ounces of batter, 
two eggs beat up in half a pint of good miJk, 
and some salt; mix them well togetirer, 
heap it upon a dish with a table-spoon tt> 
give it a rough and rocky appearance, or 
put it on a dish and score it with a knife, 
dip a brush or feather into melted butler, 
and brush over the top lightly ; put it into 
a Dutch oven, and let it brown gradually 
for an hour or more. To mash potatoes in 
a plain wav, mix with them two ounces of 
butter, half a pint of milk, and a little salt. 
When mashed potatoes are not browned, it 
is a gr^t imfn^vement to add pepper, sah, 
and one onion minced as finely as possible; 
lieat tlie potatoes in a saucepan, and serve 
them hot. 

POTATOES, ROASTED. Wash and 

dry your fiotatoes, (all of a size), and pot 
them in a tin Dutch oven, or cheese-toaster: 
take care not to put tliem too near the fire, 
or they will get burned on the outside before 
they ai-e warmed through. Large ]iotatoe3 
will require two hours to roast them. 
N. B. To save time and trouble, soinc 
cooks half boil them first. 'Hiis is one of 
the best opportunities tlie baezr Ikis to 
rival the cook. 

POTATOES ROASTED UNDER 
MEAT. Half boil large potatf les, drain the 
water fi'om them, and |Mtt tliem into an earth- 
en dish, or small tin pan, under meat that is 
roasting, and baste them with some of the 
dripping: when tliey jire browned on one 
side, turn them and bro-\vn the other; send 
them up round tlie meat, or in a small dish. 

POTATOES SCALLOPED. Mfish po- 
tatoes as directed, then butter some nice 
clean scollop-shells, patty-pans, or tea-cni'S 
or saucers; put in your potatoes; make 
tliem smooth at the top; cress a knife over 
them; strew a few fine bread-crumbs on 
them: sprinkle them with a paste-brush 
with a few drops of melted butter, and then 
set them in a Dutch oven ; when they are 
browned on the top, take them carefliHy out 
of the shells, and brown the other side.

POT POURRI. Gather, when perfect- 
ly dryi, a peck of roees; pick off the leaves, 
and strew over them three-quarters of a 
pound of oonmion salt; let them remain 
two or three days, and if any finesh flowers

kled over them. Mix with tiie roses half a 
ponnd of finely-pounded bay salt, the same 
quantity of allspice, of cloves, and of brown 
BO^, a quarter of a pound 6f gum-beiija-

^ass of iH-andy, and any sort of fragrant 
flow^, such as <Hange and lemon flowers, 
rosemary, and a ^reat quantity of lavender 
ftiwers — also white lilies: a green orange 
atuck with cloves may be added. All the 
flowers most Be gathered perfectly dry. 

POTTING BEEF, VEAL, GAME, or 
POULTRY. Take three pounds of lean 
gravy beef, rub it well with an ounce of 
0akpetre, and then a handful of common 
aalt; let it lie in salt for a couple of days, 
nibbing it well each day ; then put it into 
an earthen pan or stone jar that will just 
liold it ; cover it witli die skin and fat diat 
you cut off, and pour in half a pint of wa- 
ter; cover it close with paste, and set it in 
a very slow oven for about four hours. 

When it comes from the oven, drain the 
gravy from it into a basin ; pick out the gris- 
tles and the skins; mince it fine; moisten it 
with a little of the gravy you poured from 
the meat, which is a very strong consomme 
(but rather sak), and it will make excellent 
pease soup, or browning; pound tlie meat 
{xitiently and thoroughly in a mortar with 
some fresh butter, till it is a fine paste (to 
make potted meat smooUi there is nothing 
equal to plenty of elbow-grease) ; seasoning 
it by degrees, as you are lx»ting it, with 
a little black pepper and allspice, or cloves 
pounded, or mace, or grated nutmeg. 

Put it in pots, pi'ess it down as close as 
possible, and cover it a quarter of an inch 
tliick with clarified butter; and if you wish 
to preserve it a long time, over that th a 
bladder. Keep it in a dry place. 

You may mince a little ham or bacon, or 
an anchovy, sweet or savory herbs, or an 
eschalot, and a little tarragon, chervil, or 
bumet, &c., and pound them with the meat, 
with a glass of wine, or some mustard, or 
farcemeaLt. 

It is a very agreeable and economical 
way of using Uie remains of game or poul- 
try, or a large joint of either roasted or 
boiled beef, veal, ham, or tongue, &c. to 



mince it with some of the fat, or moiita 
it with a little butter, and beat it in a mor* 
tar with the seasoning, Bk, 

Meat that has been boiled down for 
gravies, &c. (which has heretofiNre beeo 
considered the perquisite of the cat) and if 
completely drained of all its succulence, beat 
in a mortar with salt and a little ground 
black pepper and allspice, as dire<Sed in 
die foregomg receipt, and it wiD make as 
good potted beef as meat that has been 
baked till its moisture is enturely extracted, 
which it must be, or it will not keep two 
days. 

Mex. — Meat that has not been previous-

which has. 

POULTRY. In choosing a turkey, the 
young cock bird is to be preferred ; the best 
have olack legs, and if young, die toes and 
bill are pliable and foci m(i. A hen turkey 
is chosen by the same roles. 

Fowls witli black legs are the best; if 
fresh, the vent is close and dark; if young, 
the combs are bright in the color, and tbie 
legs smooth — die spurs of a young cock are 
short. 

A goose, if young and fine, is plump in 
the breast, the fat white and soft, the feet 
yellow, and but few hairs upon them. 

Ducks may be chosen by the same rules, 
and are hard and thick on the breast and 
belly. 

* Pigeons diould be quite fresh, the breast 
plump and fat, the feet elastic, and neither 
flabby nor discolored at the vent. 

To projiare a turkey for dressing, every 
plug is carefully picked out ; and in drawing 
turkeys and fowls, care must be taken not 
to break the gall bag, nor the gut which 
joins the gizzard, as it is impossible tp re- 
move the bitteroess of the one, or tlie gritti- 
ness of the other. Tlie hairs are sin^d off 
witli white paper; the Icg-lione is oroken 
close to the foot, and tlie sinews drawn out 
— ^a clodi is then put over the breast, and 
the bone flattened with a rolling-pin, the 
liver and gizzard, made delicately clean, are 
fastened into each pinion. A stuffing made 
with sausage meat, adding some grated 
bread, and mixing it with die beaten yolks 
of two egg*, or a stuffing as for a fillet of 
veal, is tlien put into the breast, and die 
turkey, well robbed over with flour, is i>ut 
down to roast. It is basted constantly with 
butter, and wlicn the steam draws towards 
the fire, it is nearly done ; — it is then dredg- 
ed with flour, and basted with more butter, 
sen'ed with gravy in the disli, and garnislied 
with sausages, or with forcemeat balls if 
veal stuffing is used, and bread sauce in a 
sauce tureen.

cloth, and boiled in water, with a little salt, 
butter, and lemon-juice added. It is served 
thickly covered with celery sauce. 

Turkey poults are stuffecl and roasted in 
the same manner as a full^own turkey. 
Tliey will requii-e rather more than an hour 
to roast. Tliey are dressed widi the heads 
twisted undei' the wing, as are also turkeys 
sometimes, but it seems an injudicious cus- 
tom, as tlie side on which the bead is cannot 
he nicely browned, and in carving, the, blood 
from the nesk is apt to mingle widi llie 
gravv. 

To roast a fowl. It is picked, nicely 
cleaned, and singed; tlie neck is cut off 
close by the back ; tlie fowl is then washed, 
and if a large one, stuffed willi ftMtxmeat. 
It is trussed and dredged with flour ; and 
when put down to roast, basted well witli 
butter, and frothed up. When tlie steam is 
observed to draw towards tlie fire, it is 
sufliciently done ; served with gravy in die 
disli, and bread sauce in a butter tureen. 
A good-sized fowl will require above an hour 
to roast. 

Chickens are roasted as tlie above, and 
served with gravy in tlie dish, which is 
^nished with fried eggs, and bread cauce 
in a sauce tureen; they will require from 
half an hour to three-quarters to roast. 

To boil a fowl. Wlien nicely singed, 
waslidd, and trussed, it is well dredged with 
flour, and put on in boiling water, and if a 
large one, boiknl neai-Iy an liour. It is 
served with parsley and butter, white, or 
liver sauce. 

Two boiled fowls, served with a tongue 
between them, make a handsome top dish. 

Boiled chickens are improved by being 
stuffed, and will require nearly lialf an hour 
to boil. 

To roast a goose. After being well 
cleaned, picked, and singed, it is washed, 
made perfectly drv, and stuffed with about 
four table-spoonfuu of grated bread, an on- 
ion finely minced, together with three sage- 
leaves, seasoned with salt and pepper, and 
mixed witli a well-beaten e^; or, the 
stuffing is made of boiled mashed potatoes, 
seasoned in the same way as tlie other, and 
mixed with a beaten egg. If roasted on a 
spit, each end is tied on tightly ; it is basted 
at first with a little bit of butter, after which 



the fill thftt drapi from it is Med. It h 
served with gravy in the diib, and ap|il» 
sauce in a sauce tureOD. A hurge gooee wifl 
require an hour and a half to roast. At t^ 
ble, an opening Is cut in the apnm, and « 
glass of Port wine, with which is naixed a 
mr^ tea-epoonful oi'made mostard, is poor- 
ed mto tlie body of the goose. .Thie is also 
an improvement to duclu. 

Aereen gooee, about two or three moodit 
old, is seasoned with pepper and salt oiily» 
and requires to be basted with batter. It 
requii«s about an hour to roast. 

To roast ducks. The^ are niody picked, 
cleaned, singed, and washed, seascxied with 
pepper and salt ; or stuffed, and sia*ved with 
gtavy, as directed in pp. 66, 67. A duck 
may be boifed for nearly an hour, and served 
with onion sauce poured over it. 

PRESERVES, SWEETMEATS. «MJ. 
All sweetmeats sbouki be preserved in a 
brass pan, which must be well scoured with 
sand and vin^pu', washed with hot water, 
and wiped perfectly dry bdbre it is need. 

An iron plate or stove is preferable to a 
fire fur preserving on; and by boilmg the 
fruit quickly, the fyrm, cokir, and mnarp 
will be better preserved, wad there will be 
less waste than in sbw boiling. A roood 
wooden stick, smaller at one end than at 
the other^ in Scotland called a thevil, is 
better adapted for stirring su^r or preserves 
witli than a silver spoon, which last is only 
used for skimming. That there may be no 
waste in taking off the scum, it is put ihroqgh 
a fine silk sieve, or tlirougb a hair sieve, 
with a bit of muslin laid into it; the dear 
port will run into the vessel placed bdow» 
and may be i^eturued to the preserving* 
})an.> 

A silver soup kidle is used dor putting pre> 
serves into the jars, which shouki be of 
bi*own stone, or of white wedgewood ware. 
After tlie jellies or preserves are put in, tfaqr 
must not be moved till quite cold, when they 
are covered with a piece of white paper, cut 
so as to fit into the jar, and dipped into brandy 
or nim. They are then stored in a cool dry 

fkce, and sbouki be kxiked at occasionally, 
f in a few weeks thev be observed to fir- 
ment, the sirup should be first strained finom 
the fruit, then boiled till it is tbuk, and 
again poured over the fruit, previously put 
into clean jars. 

Sugar, low in pnob, and consequentFjr 
coarse in quality, is for from being cheapest 
in tlie end ; while that which is most refin* 
ed is always the best. White sugars abould 
be dioeen as shining and as ckise in te&tara 
as possible. 

The best sort of brown sugar has a hrigbt 
and gravelly appearance.

PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. 
Great nicety is to be observed in prepar- 
ing eveiy material used for boiled or baked 
puddings. 

The 9ggB require to be well beaten, iat 
whidi purpose, if many are to be done, a 
whisk 18 used; if few, a three-pronged fork. 
The floor it dried and sifted. The cumnta 



are carefidly cleaned, fay patting them irito 
a cullender, and pouring warm water ow 
them; if very dirty, this is to be repeated 
two or tliree times, and after beinff dried hi 
a dish before the fire, they are nibbed m a 
clean coarse clodi, all the stalks and stones 
picked out, and then a little flour dredssd 
over them. The raisins are stoned with a 
small sharp-pointed knife ; it b cleansed in 
a basin of water, which also receives the 
seed. The pudding cloth must be kept es- 
pecially clean, or it will impart an unpleas- 
ant taste to anything that is boiled in it; 
and wlien taken off a pudding, it ought im- 
mediately to be laid in cold water, and af- 
terwaids well washed with soda «r pearl- 
aslies in hot water. Just before being used 
for a rice, bread, or batter puddii^, it 
should be dipped into hot water. Mining, 
shaken, and well dredged with flour; ami 
for a phim, su^ pudding, or any sort of 
fiuit pudding in paste, it must he buttered 
before being floured. 

The virater should boil quick when the 
pudding is put in ; and it should be moved 
about for a minute, for fear the ingredients 
should not mix. 

When the pudding is done, a pan of cold 
water should be r»dy, and the pudding 
dipped into it as soon as it comes out of the 
pot, which will (H«vent its adhering to the 
cloth. 

A bread podding should be tied loose; 
if batter, it must he tied tight over, and a 
battor pudding should be strained throi^ a 
coarse sieve when all is mixed. In others, 
the esgs only. If you boil the podding ia 
a basin or pan, take care that it is always 
well buttered. 

When you make your puddings wvthoot 
e^, they most have as little milk aa wiH 
mix, and must boii for three or four hours. 
A few spoonfuls of small beer, or one of 
yeast, is the best substitute for eggs. Yoor 
puddings will always be much lighter if yoo 
beat the yolks and whites of the eggs long 
and separately. You may, if you please, 
use snow instead of eggs, either in puddings 
or pancakes. Two large spoonfols will sup- 
ply the place of one esg; tJie snow may be 
taken up (torn any ciran spot before it is 
wanted, and will not lose its virtue, though 
the sooner it is used the better. 

All puddings in paste are tied tightly, but 
other puddings kxMeljr, in the cloth. When 
a pudding is to be boiled in a shape, a piece 
of buttered white paper is put upon the top 
of it, before the tioiired cloth is tied oo. 
The pan, dish, or shape, in which the pod- 
ding is to be either boiled or baked, murt 
always be buttered before it is filled. It is 
an improvement to puddings in general to 
let them stand some time after being prepared 
for boiling or baking. When a pod-

ding i» to be boiled, it imnt be pot on io a 
covered pot, in plenty of boiling water, and 
never for a moment be allowed to be off the 
boil antil ready to be served. Ai the water 
wastes, more, and always boiling, must be 
added. A plum pudding is the better for 
beingnnixed the day before it is to be boiled. 
It may be useful to observe that this pudding 
will keep for months after it is dressed, if 
the cloth be albwed to remain upon it, and 
if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet ot 
foolscap paper, and dien hung up in a cool 
place. Wben about to be used, it must be 
pot into a clean cloth, and again boiled for 
an hour ; or it may be cut inta slices, and 
broiled as wanted. If in Ix'eaking eggs a 
bad one should accidentally drop into the 
basin amongst the rest, the whole will be 
spoiled ; and therefore they should be broken 
one hy one into a tea-cup. When the 
whites only of eggs are required for a jelly, 
or other things, the yolks, if not broken, will 
keep good for tliree days, if the btsln they 
are in be covered. 

A slab of marble, stone, or slate, is pref- 
erable to wood for rollin? out paste on. 
The rolling-pin, cutters, and every other im- 

Element used in these processes, must be 
ept (mrticularly clean ; tliey should always 
be washed immediately after being used, 
and tlien well dried. Before using butter 
for paste, it is laid for some time into cold 
water, which is clianged once or twice. 
When salt butter is used, it is well worked 
in two or tliree waters. If it should not be 
convenient to make the paste immediately 
before it is baked, it will not sufler from 
standing, if made early in the morning, and 
the air excluded from it, by putting lirst a 
tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and 
above tliat a folded taole-clotli. To ascer- 
tain if the oven be of a proper heat, a little 
bit of paste may be bakeld in it, before any 
tiling else be put in. Puff paste requires 
radier a brisk oven. If too hot it binds the 
surface and prevents the steam from rising, 
and if too slow it becomes sodden and flat. 
Raised crusts require a quick oven; pufis 
and tartlets, which are filled with preserved , 
fruit, are sufficiently done when the paste is 
baked. Wlien lai^ pies have been in the 
oven for a few minutes, a paper is put over 
them to prevent their hieing burned. 

PUDDING. Sweeten a pint and a half 
of cream, and boil it with the peel of a small 
lemon ; cut the crumb of a twopenny roll, 
and put it into the cream, and boil it for

APPLE, BOILED. CSiopfour 

Omioes of beef suet very fine, or two ounces 
of batter, lard, or dripping ; but the suet 
makes the best and lightest crust ; put it 
on the paste-board, with eight ounces of 
flour, and a salt-spoonftil of aak, mix it well 
together with vouir hands, and then put it all 
ef a heapj ana make a hole in the middle ;

mgch water as wilt make it of a stiff paste: 
nil it out two or three times, widi the roll- 
in^-pia, aad then roll it larse enough to re- 
oeive thirtem ounces of appws. It will look 
neater if boiled in a basin, well buttered, 
than when boiled in a pudding-cloth, well 
floored; boil it an hour and three-quarters: 
but the sorest way is to stew the apples first 
in a stewpaa, with a wine-glassful c^ water, 
aad then one hour will boil it. Some people 
like it flavored widi cbves and lemon-peel, 
aad sweeten it with two ounces of sugar. 
Gooseberries, currants, raspberries, and cher-

APPLE, A LA FRAN- 

CAISE. To make the entrem^ proper- 
hr, it is neoeasary to liave a mould in the 
torm of a dome four inches deep and six in 
diameter; this mould and its lid should be 
mreed all cfwr, the same as a skimmer. 
Then sfaookl be a rim round the lid of the 
dome that k may cover it so closely that ail 
air may be excluded. 

Feel six and thirty small red apples 
and cut them into quarters; toss them in a 
fltewpan with four ounces of fine sugar 
^ofver which amst be grated the rind of an 
orange), and four oenoes of butler luke- 
warm; then place the stewpan over the 
fltove, with fire on the cover. Wiien your 
apples are done, pour them into a dish. 
Whilst they are cooling mix up three-cniar- 
tenof apoandof stiff paste; then roU out 

14 



half eC it ta the ihiefaHM of ihi «^Mi<rffl| 
inch. With this onist line the uHide ol 
voor mouU, which must .be peevMiasly ml 
buttered. Be carefld that the paste Iqra 
quite flat, leaving a piece aV raond the edge 
of the moakl, then pot ia the best quartan 
of tlie appkis, and fill op the aioaki with the 
rest of the apples and their lainor, then raB 
out the rest of the paste verv tarn, iato two 
parts, cut in rounds. Sligatly moislen the 
paste which you have left round the edoe of 
the mould, and p lace upon it one of the 
rounds of paste, pmching the edges carefii^y 
together, thea aiightly moislen, and plaoa 
upon it your other round piece of paste, 
pinching the edge of this with the others to 
make it quite close^ then cover them with 
the lid of die mouU well buttered. 

Now, turn your mould over into the mid- 
dle of a napkin, and tie up the oomers of it 
ckwe over the top bf the dome, and put it 
into a saucepan (nine inches deep and nine 
wide) foil of boiling water; ana let it be 
kept constantlv boihng for an hour and a 
half; when it has boileid fin* this time, take 
it oitt of the saucepan, untie the napkin, 
take out the mould, remove the lid, phwe 
the mould on a dish, and then oarefoUy take 
it off from the pudduig; strew fine sugar all

a pound of marrow, stone and out a qnarier 
era pound of raisins, take the same cjuantily 
of nicely-cleaned currants, beat well six eggs, 
a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, and the 
same of nntmeg ; mix all dioroughly with the 
bread and milk, sweeten it well witli brown 
Bbgar, and bake it, widi or without a bor- 
der of puff paste round the dish, three-quar- 
ters 01 an hour. It may be baked, in a 
Dutch oven, and after baking it for three- 

3uarters of an hour, put a im cover over 
le top, and place the dish upon a gridiron, 
over a slow fire, and let it remain for fifteen

NASMU. Ptat into a 



^ihites of three eggs ; strain them through a 
sieve (to keep out the treddles), and gradu- 
ally add to them about a quarter pint of milk ; 
stir these well together. Rub togetlier in a 
mortar two ounces of moist sugar and as 
much grated nutmeg as will lie on a shilling; 
stir them into the eg^s and milk ; then put 
in four ounces of ftour, and beat it into a 
smooth batter; by degrees stir into it seven 
ounces of suet (minced as fine as possible) 
and three oimces of bread crumbs. Mix all 
thoroughly together at least half an hour be- 
fore you put the pudding into the pot. Put it 
into an eartlien pudding mould, that is well 
buttered. Tie a cloth over it very tight; 
pot it into boiling water, and boil it thrle^ 
flours. Half a pound of raisins cut in half 
added to the above, will make a most admi- 
rable pkHn pudding. Grated lemon-peel is 
also fine. 

Don't let the water cease to boll : it will 
spoil the pudding. And it is always Ijest 
tpat puddmgs be mixed an lK>ur or two be- 
finre put into the pot, the ingredients get 
amaleamated, and the whole becomes richer 
and fuller of flavor. 

The above pudding may be baked in an 
oven, or under meat, as Yorkshire pudding, 
only add half pint more milk. Should it be 
above an inch and quarter in thickness, it 
will take fiiU two hours; and requires care- 
ful watching ; for if tlie top gets burned, a 
bad flavor will pervade the whole pudding. 
Or, butter some tin patty-pans or saucers, 
fill them with pudding, and bake about an 
hour in a Dutch oven.

QUINCES THE SPANISH WAT. 

Pare and core tm pounds of quinces, pot 
them into a stewpan with a pint and a faaif 
of wato* and two pounds of fine 8i^;ar, set 
them on a sk)w fire, and when th^ begin 
to dry, moisten them with rose-water and 
sack, or white wine; then press the paste 
through a coarse sieve, add two pounds c^ 
siffiar, a little orange-fiower and rose water. 
When sufficiently done, it will come off 
clean, if dropped on a plate; then set it 
aside to cool. Put it into shallow pots, 
strew perfumed comfits over, and cover 
them close. 

QUINCES, SIRUP OF. Pare and 
scrape some very ripe quinces into a linen 
cloth, press out the juice, which put in m 
very warm place, or where it is exposed to 
the sun, until all the fecula folk to the bot- 
tom; then strain it well, and for evfsry 
quarter of a pound of juice, take one pound 
of sugar; mix them tosether, and boil the 
wliole to perle; take it off, and when the 
sirup is nearly cold, it may be bottled. 
Take care to keep the bottles well corked. 

QUINCE TART. Take some preser- 
ved quim^s, make a sirup with some sugar 
and water, of which, and the preserve, take 
an equal weight, and put it into a pr^erving- 
pan; boil, skim, and then put in the fruit; 
when tolerably clear, lay the quinces in a 
tart-dish with puff paste as usual ; cover and 
bake it ; as soon as it is done raise the top 
gently, pour in tlie sirup, ice it, and serve* 

QUIN'S SAUCE. See Sauce, 

QUINTESSENCE OF ANCHOVY. 

The goodness of this preparation depends 
almost entirely on liaving fine melk)w fish, 
that have been in pickle long enough (t. e, 
about twelve months) to dissolve easily, yet 
are not at all rusty. 

Choose those that are in the state they 
come over in, not such as have been put into 
firesh pickle, mixed with red paint, which 
some add to improve the complexion of the 
fish; it has been said, that others have a 
trick of putting anchovy liquor on pickled 
sprats; you will easily discover this by wash- 
ing one of diem, and tasting the flesh of it, 
which in the fine anchovy is mellow, red, 
and hirii-flavored, and the bone moist and 
oily. Make only as much as will soon be 
used, the friraher it is the better. 

Put ten or twelve anchovies into a mortar, 
and pound them to a pulp ; put this into a 
very clean iron, or silver, or very weD 
tinned saucepan; then put a large table- 
spoonfiil of cold spring-water (we prefer 
good vinegar) into the mortar; shake it 
round, and pour it to the pounded anchovies,

of wato* and two pounds of fine sugar, set 
them on a skiw fire, and when th^ begin 
to dry, moisten them with rose-water and 
sack, or white wine; tfien press the paste 
through a coarse sieve, add two poun<u <^ 
sugar, a little orange-flower and rose water. 
When sufficiently done, it will come off 
clean, if dropped on a plate; then set it 
aside to cool. Put it into shallow pots, 
strew perfiimed comfits over, and cover 
them close. 

QUINCES, SIRUP OP. Pare and 
scrape some very ripe quinces into a linen 
cloth, press out the juice, which put in m 
very warm place, or where it is exposed to 
the sun, until all the fecula falls to the bot- 
tom; then strain it well, and for ev««Y 
quarter of a pound of juice, take one pound 
of sugar; mix them tosether, and boil the 
wliole to perle; take it off, and when the 
sirup is nearly cold, it may be bottled. 
I'ake care to keep the bottles well corked. 

QUINCE TART. Take some preser- 
ved quinces, make a sirap widi some sugar 
and water, of which, and the preserve, take 
an equal weight, and put it into a preserving- 
pan; boil, skim, and then put in the fruit; 
when tolerably clear, lay the quinces in a 
tart-dish with puff paste as usual ; cover and 
bake it ; as soon as it is done raise the top 
gently, pour in die simp, ice it, and serve. 

QUIN'S SAUCE. See Sauce. 

QUINTESSENCE OF ANCHOVY. 

The goodness of this preparation depends 
almost entirely on having fine melk)w fish, 
that have been in pickle long enough (t. e. 
about twelve months) to dissolve easily, yet 
are not at all rusty. 

Choose those that are in the state they 
come over in, not such as have been put into 
firesh pickle, mixed with red paint, which 
some add to improve tbe complexion of the 
fish; it has been said, that others have a 
trick of putting ancho\7 liquor on pickled 
sprats; you will easily discover this by wash- 
ing one of them, and tasting the flesn of it, 
which in the fine anchovy is mellow, red, 
and high-flavored, and tHe bone moist and 
oily. Make only as much as will soon be 
used, the fVesher it is the better. 

Put ten or twelve anchovies into a mortar, 
and pound them to a pulp ; put this into a 
very clean iron, or silver, or yery weO 
tinned saucepan ; then put a large table- 
spoonful of cold sfHring-water (we prefer 
good vinegar) into the mortar; shake it 
round, and pour it to the poimded anchoviei.

quenilv sUrring them together till they are 
Melted, which they will be in the courae of 
five minutes. Now stir in a quarter of a 
drachm of oood cayenne pepper, and let it 
temain by the side of the fire for a few min- 
utes longer; then, while it is warm, rub it 
tfiroagh a hair sieve, with the bock of a 
wooden spoon. 

The essence of anchovy, is made with 
double the al>uve quantity of water, as they 
are of opinion that it ouglit to be so thin as 
not to hang about the sides of the bottle; 
when it does, the large surface of it is soon 
acted upon Inr the air, and becomes rancid 
and spoils all the rest of it. 

A roll of thin^cut lemon-peel inftised with 
Uie anchovy, imparts a fine, fresh, delicate, 
aromatic flavor, which is vei^ grateful ; this 
is only recommended when you make sauce 
fix* immediate use ; it will keep much better 
without: if you wish toacidulute it, instead 
of water make it with artificial lemon-juice.

RABBITS. (1) Truss your rabbits short, 
lay them in a bsisin of warm water for ten 
inmutes, titen put them into plenty of water, 
and boil them Bbout half an hour; if large 
ones, three-quarters; if very old, an hour: 
mother them with plenty of white onion 
sauce, mince the liver, and lay it round the 
dish, or make liver sauce, and send it up in 
a boat. 

Obs. — ^Ask those you are goin^ to make 
liver sauce for, if th^ like plain liver sauce, 
or liver and parsley, or liver and lemon sauce. 

N. B. — It will save much trouble to >he 
carver, if the rabbits be cut up in the kitchen 
into pieces fit to help at table, and the head 
* divided, one-half laid at each end, and slices 
of lemon and the liver, chopped very finely, 
laid on the sides of the dish. 

At all events, cut off the head before you 
send it to table, we hardly remember that 
the thing ever lived if we don't see tlie head, 
while it may excite ugly ideas to see it cut 
Vp in an attitude imitative of life; besides, 
for the preservation ai the head, the poor Jem- 
imal sometimes suflfera a slower deatn. 

RABBITS. (2) If your fire is dear 
and sharp, thirty minutes will roast a ^oung, 
and forty a full gromn rabbit. When you 
lay it down, baste it with butter, and dredge 
it li|^tly and oarefolly with floor, that you 
May have it frothy, and of a fine li^t brown. 
While the rabbit is roasting, boil its liver 
with some parsley ; when tender, chop them 
togethor, and put half the mixture into some 
ipahed battier, reasnring the other half for 



9Uiii8h» divided into little bSUocka. C^ 
off the head, and lay half on each ttde of 
the dish. 

06«.— A fine, wdUgrown (but yoiaig) 
warren rabbit, kept sometime after it Ins 
been killed, and roasted with a stufiing ia 
its belly, eats very like a hare, to the natm 
of whicli it approaclies. It is nice, nourishing 
food when young, but hard and unwholesome 
when old. 

RABBIT, BROILED. Take a couple of 
young rabbits, cut them up, and pat then to 
steep for a few hours in a little oil, miiiad 
with parsley, leeks, a few roushrooma, anda 
cbve of garlic, all slired fine, salt and pepper; 
roll each piece of rabbit in a rasher of fancoe, 
and put them, with a part of the seasoDJog, 
into pieces of white paper ; butter tlie papers 
inside ; broil upon a gridiron oTer a vefj 
slow fire, and serve hot in the papers. 

RABBITS, IN A FRICASSEE. Take 
two fine white rabbits, and cut them m 
pieces, by cuttii^ off tlic le^, ahoukierB, and 
back; blanch them in boiling water, and 
skim them for one mimite; stir a fisw trim- 
mings of mushrooms in a stewpan over the 
fire, with a bit of butter, till it begins to fry, 
then stir in a spoonfiil of flour ; mix into the 
flour, a little at a time, nearly a qaart of 
good consommey which set on the fire, and 
when it boils, put the raU)its in, and let them 
boil gently till done, then put tliem into 
another stewpan, and reduce the sauce till 
nearly as thick as paste; mix in about half 
a pint of good boiling cream, and wheo k 
becomes the thickness of beehameiU sasee 
in general, squeeze it through the taBuoy 
to the rabbits; make it very hot, shake iaa 
few mushrooms, the yolk of an ^g, and a 
little cream, then serve it to table. Rabbits 
may also be preserved, white or brows, in 
the same manner as chickens. 

RABBIT, MINCED. Take the le- 
niains of a roasted rabbit, cut otf all the 
meat, and mince it with a little roast mutton. 
Then break the bones of the rabbit into 
small pieces, and pot them into a atewpaa, 
with a slice of buttor, some shallots, half a 
clove of garlic, thyme, a bay-leaf, and baal; 
^ive these a few turns over the fire, then shake 
w a little flour; moisten with a giasa of red 
wine, and the same quantity of stock, and 
let it boil over a dow fire for half an boor; 
strain it off, and put in the minced mea^ 
adding salt and coarse pepper; heat As 
whole, without boiling, aaid aervie hot: ga^ 
nish with fi-ied bread. 

RABBITS IN A MINUTE. CM vmi

browned, add a little shred parsley and shal- 
k>tB, leave it three or four mioutee longer on 
the fire, and then aeafve. Ten or fifteen inin> 
utes are sufi^ient to cook this dish. 

RABBIT PIE. Oit a couple of young 
rabbits into quarters, and bruise a quarter 
of a pound of bacon in a mortar, with the 
fivers, some pepper, salt, a little mace, pars- 
ley, cut small, and a few leaves of uweet ba- 
sil ; wlien diese are all beaten fine, line your 
pie-dish with a nice crust, then pot a layer 
of the seasoning at the liottom of the dish, 
and pot in the rabbits; pound some more 
bacon in a mortar, mix with it some fresh 
butter, and cover the ral)bits with it, and 
over that lay thin slices of bacon ; put on the 
eover, and place it in the oven ; it will be 
done iu about two hours ; when baked, take

quantity of gravy, add some rich mutton or 
veal graTy. 

RABBIT PIE, RAISED. Cut your 
rabbits in pieces, and put them into a stew- 
pan, with a bit of fresh butter, lemon-juice, 
pepper, salt, parsley, thyme, shallots, chopped 
very fine, and a little puunded mace. When 
the pieces of rabbit are about half done, lay 
them on a dish, and when cold, raise tlie 
crust; put light forcemeat at the bottom; 
the rabbit upon it, and more forcemeat upon 
the top. Cover it, and put it in a moderate 
oven to bake gently; when done, take off 
the cover, and add a ragout of sweetbreads 
cock's cx>mb6, &c., and serve. 

RABBITS, PORTUGUESE. Cutoff 
the heads of a couple of rabbits, turn the 
backs upwards, tlie two legs stripped to the 
Old, and trussed with a coiiple of skewers 
in the same manner as chickens, die wings 
turned like the pinions of a chicken ; lard 
and roast them with good gravy ; if they are 
intended for boiling, they should not be lard- 
ed, but be served with bacon, and greens, 
or celery sauce. 

RABBITS, POTTED. Take two or 
three young, but full-grown rabbits, cut them 
up, and cake off the leg bones at the thigli, 
season them well with pepper, mace, cay- 
enne, salt, and allspice, all in very fine pow- 
der, and put them into a small pan, placing 
them as ckwely together as possible. Make 
the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the 
heads and carcasses, but take off the meat 
abunt the neck. Put plenty of butter, and 
Jet tlie whole bake gendy. Let it remain in 



the ptn fiir Iipo dtjn, then put it into hmI 
poto, adding bntttr. The liven should ■!«>

RABBIT PRESERVED. Having 
board e rabbit, lard it with bacon and ham; 
season it well inside and out, roll it up, }»» 
ginning with the legs, make it ti^t, aad 
tie it. Put it into a slew-pan, with some 
oil, thyme, bay-leaf, and basil; set theai 
on the fire till done enough (but withoqt 
boiling). When sufficiently cooked, take 
oat the rabbit, draiu, let it cool, and thea 
cut it into small pieces, which put into bot> 
ties; fill them with oil and cover with wet

minced raw, grated bread, and ham, butter 
or suet, and oiopped parsley, seasoned with 
a little lemon Uiyme, grated nutmeg, salt, and 
pepper, and bound w ith an e|g beaten. Sew 
them up, and roast them before a quick fire, 
and baste tliem with butter. Serve them 
with gravy, or melted butter witli lemon 
pickle in it. Two will take an hour to 
roast. They may also be fricasseed or fried, 
cut into joint's, with plenty of fried pai-sley, 
and served with a ssmce made of tlie Viy&r 
and some parsley chopped, and mixed in

stew them in the followiag sauce: Brown 
Ihree ounces of butter in a stewpan, with a 
table-spoonful of floor, a minced onion, some 
pepper and salt; add a pint of gravy and 
the rabbits, stew them till they are tender, 
aad'k little before serving, stir in a talHe- 
qpoonilil of ketchup. Wli^i it is wished to 
dress with a white sauce, the rabbits are not 
fried, but stewed in while stock, which is 
seasoned with white pepper, and salt, and 
thickened with a piece of butter mixed widi 
flour. A few minutes before serving, a little 
cream is added, and a table-spoonful of leiiion 
pickle. 

RADISHES IN BROTH. Take some 
young radishes, pick and scald them, cut 
them into halves or quarters according to 
their size, and boil diem with a slice of ba- 
eon in some stock. In a little time take 
them out, drain, and put them into another 
stew-pan, with conMmmef or veal gravy, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Let them 
stew gently in this till they are flavcnned, of 
a good -color, and the sauce pretty thick; 
then serve them. ' 

RAGOUT POWDER. Two ounces 
<^ truffles, two of dried mushrooms, the 
peel of a lemon, and the same of a Seville 
orange grated, half a grated nutmeg, half an 
ounce of mace, the same of pepper, and one 
drachm of cayenne, dry them all well before 
the fire, pound them to a fine powder, add 
one ounce of salt, sift the powder through a 
sieve, and keep it it in a bottle for use. 

RAGOUT OF SNIPES. Pick six or 
eight snipas very nicely, but do not wash 
them ; take out the inside. Roast the birris, 
and cut off all the meat from the breasts, in 
thin slices; pound the bones, legs, and 
backs, in a mortar, and put ihem into a 
stew-pan, with the juice of a lemon, a little 
flour, and some welI-sea$*oned gravy ; boil it

RAGOUT OF COLD VEAL. Either 
a neck, loin, or fillet of veal, will furnish 
this excellent ragout with a very little expense 
or trouble. Cut the veal into handsome cut- 
lets; put a piece of butter or clean dripping 
into a frying-pan ; as soon as it is hot, flour 
and fry the veal of a light brown: take it 
out, and if you have no gravy ready, make 



some as follows: put a pint of boiling waller 
into the frying-pan, give it a boil up icH* a 
minute, and strain it into a basin while yoa 
make some thickening in the following man- 
ner: put about an oimoe of butter into a 
stewpan ; as soon as it mehs, mix with it u 
much flour as will dry it up ; stir it over the 
fire for a few minutes and gradually add to it 
the gi'avy you made in the frying-pan; let 
them simmer together for ten minutes (tiS 
thoroij^hly incorporated); season it with pep- 
per, salt, a little mace, and a wine-glassfel of 
mushroom ketchup or wine ; strain it throodi 
a tamis to the meat, and stew very eendy 
till the meat is thorouphty warmed. If yov 
have any ready boiled Bacon, cut it in slices, 
and put it in to warm with the meat. 

RAMEQUINS. Take a quarter of a 
pound of Cheshire cheese, scraped, die samo 
quantity of Gloucester cheese, and beat them 
in a mortar, widi a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, the yolks of four eggs, and tho 
inside of a French roll, boiira in cream till 
soft ; wlien all is beaten to a paste, mix it 
with the whites of the eggs, previously beat- 
en, and put the paste into small paper cases, 
made rather long than square, and put them 
to bake in a Dutch oven, till of a fine brow% 
They should be served quite liot. You may, 
if you diink proper, add a glass of white wine. 

RASPBERRY CREAM. See Cretan 

RASPBERRY DUMPLINGS. Take 
some good puff paste, roll, it out, and spread 
raspberry jam over it; roll it up, and boil it 
rather more than an hour; cut it into five 
slices ; pour melted butter into the dish, grate 
sugar round, and serve. 

RASPBERRY FRITTERS. Grate 
two Naples biscuits, or tlie crumb of a Freoch 
roll; put to either a pint of boiling cream. 
When this is cold, add to it the yolks of four 
^gs, well beaten; beat all well together 
with some raspberry juice; drop this id very 
small quantities, into a pan of boiling Ian}; 
stick them with blanched almonds, sliced. 

RASPBERRY FLUMMERY. Mix

pound of raspberries, or one pound of pre- 
served raspben'ies, let it boil for three or 
four minutes, stirring it constanly; strain 
it through a hair sieve; dissolve one ounce 
of isinglass in half a pint of %vater; mix 
with it three-quarters of a pound of pimnded 
sugar, add it to the strained raspberrief

RICE 



RASPBEBRY ICE. Fran ^ joke 
from 88 maaty raspberrries as will yreld a 
pound and a half; put it into a glazed pan, 
and leave it for four days. Then careffally 
raise the skin that has fanned on the top of 
k, pour off the juice into another vem ; 
cWify a pound and a half of BOfpur, with a 
pint and a half of water, add the juice, and 
give them half a dozen boils; if not ml^ 
cientiy red, put in a root of oi-kanet, which 
leave in till of the proper color; strain the 
preparation throi;^li a sieve ; when cold, put 
It into the H^tiere, and freeze it. See lee. 

RASPBERRY SPONGE. Dissolve 
in a little water three-quarters of an ounce 
of isinglass, add to it three-quarters of a 
pint of cream, and the same pi'oportion of 
new milk, nearly half a pint of raspbernr 
jellv* and the juice of a lemon. Whisk it 
well one way till it becomes thick, and loc^s 
like sponge, then put it into an earthenware 
mould, and ttini it out the next day. 

RASPBERRY TART. Line your 
dish with a nice puff paste, lay in sugar 
and fruit, put bars across, and buie. 

RASPBERRY TART with cream. 
Line a patty-pan with thin puff paste, lay 
in some ra8(werries, and strew some very 
finely sifted si^ar over them; cover them 
witli puff paste, and bake it ; wlien done, 
cut it open, and put in half a pint of cream, 
in which has been inreviously beaten the yolks 
of two or three eggs, and swe^ened with a 
little sugar; when this is added to the tart, 
return it to the oven five or six minutes. 

RED CABBAGE. Get a fine purpks 
cabbage, take oS tlie outside leaves, quarter 
it, take out the stalk, shred the leaves into 
a colander, sprinkle them with salt, let them 
remain till tlie morrow, drain them dry, put 
them into a jai*, and cover them with the 
pickle (or beet roots. 

RED MULLET. Scrape and wash 
them, fold ihem in buttered paper, lay them 
into a ditdi, and bake them gently. The 
liquor that comes from them, boil with a 
piece of butter, dusted with floor, a tea- 
spoonful of soy, two of essence of anchovy, 
and a lilUe white wine. Serve the sauce m 
a butter-tureen. This fish is called the sea 
woodcock, from being dressed with the 
inside. 

RELISH FOR CHOPS, &c. Pound 
fine an ounce of black pepper, and half an 
ounce -of allspice, with an ounce of salt, and 
half an ounce of sci'aped horseradish, and 
the same of eschalots, peeled and quartered ; 
put these ingredients into a pint of mushroom 

15* 



ketchup, or walnut picUe, and let them steep 
for a fortnight, and then strain it. 

06«. — A tea-spoonful or two of this is 
generally an acceptable addition, mixed 
with the gravy usually neat up for chc^ and 
steaks, or added to thkk melted butter. 

REMOULADE, INDIAN. Pound the 
yolks of ten hard eggs to a paste, dilute it 
with eight spoonfuls of oil, put in one at a 
time, and continue pounding all the time; 
then add about a dozen allspice, a tea-spoon- 
fill of saffron, four or five spoonfuls of vine- 
gar, salt, and pepper ; amalgamate the whole 
perfectly, strain it through a bolting-cloth, 
and serve it in a sauce tureen. This sauce 
should be rather thick. 

RENNET. (1) As soon as the calf 
is killed, take out the stomach, and scour it 
inside and out with salt, atler it is cleared 
of the card always found in it. Let it drain 
for a few hours, afbr which sew it up with 
two brge handfols of salt in it, or stretch it 
on a stick well salted; or keep it in the 
salt, wet, and soak a bit, which will do over 
and over by fresh water. 

RENNET. (2) Prepare the maw the 
same as in the above receipt: on the follow- 
ing day, put a handful of hawthorn-tops, a 
handful of sweet briar, a handful of rose- 
leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, 
four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted mar- 
joram, and two large spoonflils of salt, into 
two quarts of fresh sprmg water ; let them 
boil gently till the water is reduced to three 
pints, tlien strain it off, and when only milk 
warm, pour it on the maw. Slice a lemon, 
and add to it; in two days, strain it again, 
and put into bottles. Aromatic herbs may 
be put in also ; take care that it is sufficient- 
ly salt. If the maw be again salted for a 
Kw days, and dried as almve, it will be 
quite as fit for use as before ; it should be 
kept in a cool, dry place. A small quantity 
of the liquid is sufficient for turning. 

RHUBARB TART. Let the stalks be 
of a good size, take off the thin skin, and 
cut them into lengths of four or five inchei^; 
lay them in a dish, and put over a thin 
simp of sugar and water ; cover with another 
dish, and let it simmer slowly for an hour 
upon a hot hearth, or do them in a block- 
tin saucepan. As soon as cold, make it 
into a tart; when tender, the baking the 
cniM will be sufficient; or you may cut the 
stalks into little bits, the size of gooseberries, 
and make your tart the same as gooseberry 
tart. 

RICE BLANCMANGE. Put a tea- 
cupful of whole rice into the least water

possible, till it almost bursts; then add half 
a pint of good milk or thin cream, and boil 
it till it is quite a mash, stirring it the whole 
time it is on the fire, that it may not biim ; 
dip a shape in cold water, and do not dr^ 
it; put in the rice, and let it stand until 
quite cold, when it will come easily out of 
the eAiape. This dish is much approved of; 
it is eaten with cream or custard, and pre- 
served fnilts ; raspberries are best. It should 
be made the day before it is wanted, tliat it 
may get firm. This blancmanee will eat 
much nicer, flavored with spices,Temon-pee], 
&c., and sweetened with a little loaf sugar, 
add it with the milk, and take out the femon- 
peel before you put in the mould. 

RICE, TO BOIL. Wash the rice per- 
fectly clean, and put on one pound in two 
quarts of cold water; let it bou twenty min- 
utes, strain it through a sieve, and put it be- 
fore the fire ; shake it up with a fork every 
DOW and then, to separate the grains, and 
make it quite dry. Serve it hot. 

RICE CASSEROLE. Take a pound 
and a half of rice, wash it thoroughly in 
several waters (worm), and tlien put it 
into a saucepan, at least eidit inches in 
diameter; moisten it with stock, in this pro- 
portion ; if the rice lies an inch tliick, let 
the stock come two inches above it, and 
four ladlefuls of fowl skimmings ; place tlie 
saucepan on a hot stove; when tlie rice 
boils, set it on the side, and skim it; then 
put it on hot ashes, cover, and let it boil 
slowly fi)r fifteen to twenty minutes ; stir it, 
let it boil as before ; in twenty or twenty- 
five minutes, stir it again ; if by this time 
the rice is perfectly sott, take it oflf, but if 
not, add a little more liquid, and continue 
boiling until it is so; place tlie saucepan 
aslant on tlie side of the stove that the &t 
may drain away sgid be taken off easily. 
As soon as the rice is lukewarm, work it 
into a firm, smooth, paste, witli a spatula; 
it can hardly be worked up too much, as 
every grain of rice ought to pass under pres- 
sure (if necessary, add mtjire stock, a very 
little at a time). When the fraste is thus 
thoroughly worked up, form your casserole 
of it, first laying it m a heap, four or five 
incites high, and seven in diameter; do it 
with the band as you would a raised crust; 
make the ornaments of the outer surface with 
the point of a knife, or by carrots cut for 
the purpose, taking care that the decorations 
be detached from the mass of rice, at least 
an inch; attention to this particular will 
not only add to the beauty of the form, but 
to the color also, as the raised parts will be 
lighdy colored, while the ground will be 
quite white. When properly formed, mask 
the whole surface with clarified butt^, and 



pkice it in a hot oven ibr.an bodr sind a foM^ 
by which time it will be of a fine clear jA~ 
low. Take off the top of your easseraU, 
clear a%vay nil the rice firom the inside that 
does not adhere to the crust (which ought t» 
be very thin), and mix it with bechamtihy 
espagJwU, or whatever other sauce may be 
proper, put it in again, and then fill ^ov 
casserole, with such ragouts as your fancy 
may. dictate; glaze the surface of the outer 
ornaments, and serve it. Water, with but- 
ter and salt, is frequently thought preferabfe 
to the stock, &c., as the rice is thereby 
rendered much whiter. 

RICE CASSOLETTES. The riwy 
prepared as above may be put info smaller 
moulds, those called dariole moulds, and 
it should be quite cold before it is turned out, 
the mince or whatever is pat inside being 
also cold ; it must be put m carefully, that 
none of it may mix with the rice, otlierwise 
the cassolettes would tHreak in the process 
of fi'ying; for the same reason, the dripping 
must be very hot. Frying is tlie best and 
quickest method of doing them, but tb^- may 
also be browned in the oven aa the casseroe 
of rice. 

RICE CHEESE. Boil an ounce of 
rice, thick as has^ pudding, in rather less 
than half a pint of milk (new) ; pour it bat 
on an ounce and a half of butter, the same 
weight of sugar, mixing it well together; let 
it stand till cold; then add one egg, and the 
yolk of another, and a little white wine. 

RICE CREAM. Mix some rice flov 
with half a glass of cold milk ; then by de- 
grees, add a pint more, also cold, and pot 
It with a bay-leaf into a sancepan, set it on 
a slow fire for an hour and a half, then strain 
and flavor it with orange-flower water,' 
sweeten to your taste, and serve it hot. It 
should be stirred fi^uently whilst boiling; 
eg^ may be added if you think, proper. 

RICE CROQUETTES. Wash ami 
scald a quarter of a pound of rice, pot it 
into a saucepan, with the rind of a lemon, 
shred small, a qoarter of a pound of powder- 
sugar, a pinch of salt, a little crisped orai^ 
flowers, an ounce of butter, and half a pint 
of milk ; set these on the fife, and when the 
rice is quite soft, add the yolks of four eggs, 
stir tliem in over the fire, liut do not let theoi 
boil ; pour the preparatimi on a large tin or 
slab, spread it equally ; let it cool, and then 
divide it into small equal parts; roll these 
into balls, dip them into an omelet, rdl 
diem in bread-crumbs, and fry them in a 
very hot pan. As soon as the croquettes 
are of a nice color, drain, sprinkle theffl 
with powder-sugar, and serve them.

RIC£ 



fttCE CUPS. Sweeten a pint of milk 
\rith poudded loaf sugar, and boil it with a 
sdck of cinnamon; stir in sifted ground 
rice till thick ; take it off the fire, and add 
the weil-beatm whites of three ^gs ; stir it 
again over the fire for two or three minutes, 
then put it into tea-cups previously dipped in 
cold water; turn them out when cold, and 
pour round them a custard cream made with 
the yolks of the eggs ; place upon the rice a 
little red currant jelly- or raspberry jam. 
This disli may be served warm or cold ; if 
€old, raspberry cream or custard may be 
poured round it. 

RICE CUSTARDS WITHOUT 
CREAM. One tea-spoonful of rice-flour, 
a pint of new milk, the yolks of three eggs, 
a table-spoonful of ratana (or two or three 
laurel leaves boiled in), sugar to your taste; 
mix the rice very smooth, and stir it with 
the ^gs into the boiling milk, until tliick. 
Arrow-root is better tlian rice. 

RICE FLUMMERY. (1) Boil a pint of 
new milk, with a bit of lemun^ieel and cin- 
namon: then mix just sufficient rice-tlour, 
with ai little cold milk as will make tlie

cording to taste, flavor with a little pound- 
ed bitter almond; boil it, taking care not to 
let it bum ; pour it into a sliape or pint ba- 
gin, taking out the spice. When the flum- 
mery is cold, turn it into a dish, and serve 
with cream, milk, or custard, all round, or 
serve with sweet sauce in a boat.

cream, and a little white wine and sugar 
mixed with it. 

RICE FRITTERS. Boil the rice in 
milk with some powder-sugar, orange-flower 
water, a pinch of cinnamon powder, and a 
little butter; when quite soft put to it a 
liaison of volks of eggs, pour it into a pan 
to cool. Make vour preparation into balls, 
stboot the size of an egg, dip them in egg, 
firy them, spriokie them with sugar, and 
serve.

and four whole eggs, more if the rice be 
very thick; butter a mould lightly, put the 
rice into it, place the mould in hot ashes, so 
that it mav be completely enveloped in and 
covered wuh them ; in half an hour the go- 
teau will be done enoovh; then turn it ooty 
and serve. If you wish, von can make a 
touffie, by whipping the whites of six esgs; 
like other iouffles, m this case it should be 
served in a silver dish. In putting the 
preparation into the mould, be careful not 
to fill it, as the rice would swell and run 
over the edge. 

RICE MILK. Allow an ounce of rice 
for eadi person, wa«h it thoroughly in warm 
water ; set some milk on the fine, and when 
it boils, ptit in tlie rice; continue to boil it 
over a slow fire, stiiring often for two or 
three hours; add salt or sugar according 
to taste, and cinnamon. 

RICE AND MILK. To every quart 
of good milk allow two ounces of rice; 
wash it well in several waters ; put it with 
the milk into a closely-covered saucepan^ 
and set it over a slow fire; when it boils 
take it ofl*; let it stand till it be cold, and 
simmer it about an hour and a quarter be- 
fore sending it to table; and serve it in 
a tureen. 

RICE PANCAKES. Boil half a pound 
of rice in a small quanti^ of water, until 
quite a jelly ; as soon as it is cold, mix it

butter well, into half a pound of ground 

rice, moisten it with water, and roll it out 
with a little flour. 

RICE, PYRAMIDS OF. Boil some 
whole rice, make it up into the form of pyr* 
amids about three inches high, or press it 
into small tin frames of that shape; take 
out part of the rice at tlie bottom, and fill the 
space with sausage, or rich forcemeat ; place 
them in a dish, take off the fiame, and pour 
round them some rich brown gravy. 

RICE SAVOURY. Carefully wash 
aiid pick 8i>me rice; set it to stew very 
gently in a little veal or rich mutton broth,

RICE SOUP. (2) Wash your rice 
well in warm water, changing it frequently ; 
tlien put the rice into a saucepan, with 
some good stock; set it on tlie fire, and 
leave it to swell for half an hour, but do 
not let it boil ; wlien the rice has imbibed 
all the stock, add a sufficient (]uantity to 
cover tlie rice, cover, and boil it slowly fur 
two hours; in tlie meantime broil two or 
tliree slices of beef, and pepper and salt diem 
well; when of a nice dark color, throw 
them into the rice soup, to which they will 
impart a rich flavor and a fine color. 

RICE, WHOLE IN A SHAPE.

drippiof , and lay them upon the back of m 
sieve before the fire to drain. Serve then 
in a nai^in. The paste may be cut of the 
size of a large breakfast plate, tlien the 
mince put into the middle of it, the edge* 
wet all round, and gathered up into the

ter in one pint of new milk, and stir it into 
four pounds of flour, as also three table-tpoon- 
fuls of yeast, a tea-spoonful of salt, aiid the 
well-beaten whites of two eg^; cover the 
pan witli a warmed towel, and set it before 
the fire to rise for half an hour, then work it 
one way for fifteen minutes; form it into 
rolls, place them upon tins, and let them 
rise for ten minutes before putting them into 
the oven. 

ROLLS. (2) Warm an ounce of butter b 
half a pint of milk, then add a spoonfol and 
a half of yeast of small beer, and a littlesak. 
Put two pounds of flour into a pen, and put 
In the aliove. Set it to rise for an hour; 
knead it well ; make it into seven rolls, and 
bake tliem in a quick oven. 

ROLLS, FRENCH. (1) Mix rather more 
tlian an ounce of coarse salt with eight 
|)ounds of siAed flour; make a hole in the 
middle, and pour in about half a pint of 
good yeast, tlie well-beateii whites of four 
egffs, and as much new milk warmed at 
will mix it to a middling stiflbess; clap 
and work it down one way for half an hour, 
but do not knead it; cover it with a warm- 
ed towel, and let it rise before the fire for 
half an hour; take off tlie surfoce, which 
soon becomes hard, and put it aside to be 
made into a roll ; work and clap the dough, 
form it into rolls, place them upon tins, and

ROLLS, FRENCH. (3) Warm tbrae 

apooofuls of milk, and the same quantity of 
^water, witb a bit of butter tbe size of a wal- 
nut, put it to two spootifula of thick yeauSL; 
put this into tbe middle of rather more than 
a quart of flour, mix the whole together to 
tJie consistence of a batter-pudding, adding 
more flour if necessary, to make it the propor 
thickness; strew a little flour over it from 
the sides, and if the weather is cold, set it at 
a littJe distance from the fire ; do this thi-ee 
hours before it is put into the oven ; when it 
tveaks h ^ood deal ihrough the flour and ris- 
es, work It into a light paste with more warm 
milk and water ; let it lie till within a quar- 
ter of an hour of setting into the oven, then 
work them lightly into rolls ; flour a tin, and 
drop tliem on, handle them as Utile as possi- 
ble; set them before the fire. About twenty 
minutes will be sufficient time to bake diem ; 
pot a little salt into the flour. Rasp the 
tolls. 

ROLLS, SHORT, HOT. Dry before 
the fire a sufficient quantity of flour to make 
three penny-rolb, or larger if you like; add 
to it an egg well beaten, a little salt, two 
spoonfuls of yeast, and a little warm milk ; 
make it into a light dough, let it stand by 
tbe fire all night. Bake the rolls in a quick 
oven. 

ROSE-WATER, double-distilled. 
Tbe rose generally chosen for this purpose, 
is the common pale (single or double) rose, 
but tbe white rose is best of all. Gather the 
flowers in fine weather, two hours after sun- 
rise ; take out the calix, and separate the 
leaves, pound them in a nuurble nioriar to a 
paste, and leave them five or six hours in the 
mortar; then put them into a large close 
doth, and let two persona wring it with all 
dieir strength. Having by this operation ob- 
tained four pounds of juice, infuse in it an 
equal weight of fresh rose-leaves for (wenty- 
four hours; at the end of that time put the 
whole into the alembic, which place in a 
sand-badi, and distil it according to rule. 
(See DisUlling). When you have collect- 
ed about an ounce of the water, unlute the 
receiver, and if that which issues from the 
still is as odoriferous as that which proceeded 
first, continue the operation ; but if not, col- 
lect it into another vessel, as this seamd 
water is only single, and must be kept sepa- 
rate from the first, which is the EstenHal 
Water. Should the second water have an 
unpleasant smell (caused by the application 
o£ too much heat), expose it to the sun for 
a few days, covered only by a sheet (^ paper. 
The utmost care is necessary in distilling this 



and all other odoriferous substances. A still 
more powerful essence than the above may be 
procured by the following method: — Gather 
as many roses as will aflbrd thirty pounds of 
leaves, pound these with four pounds of salt; 
when pounded, place the paste in a vessel in 
layers with salt between each, press them 
closely, cork them light, leave the vessel 
twelve days, and tlien distil as usual. 

ROSE-WATER, SINGLE. Put four 
pounds of rose-leaves into a pan, wiih three 
quarts of river water, and leave it four-and- 
twenty hours ; then put it into a metal alem- 
bic, and distil fix>m it as much odorifeitMM 
water as you can, being sure to stop the uio* 
ment you observe the phlegm. Take off 
the alembic, throw away its contents, and 
rinse it out well; after this, fill it to two- 
thirds with fresh-gathered rose-leaves, otk 
which pour the ab()ve drawn rose-water; 
distil this, and when you have procured 89" 
much good rose-water as it will yield, let the* 
fire go out gradually. 

ROUX. Put a pound of butter into a 
saucepan, shake it about till dissolved, when 
add a sufficient quantity of sifted flour, to 
make it the consistence of thick bouilUs 
then set it over a fierce stove, and s^r it un- 
til it begins to take color, when make a good 
fire of cinders, place the roux on it, and let 
it stand to increase in color ; it ought to be 
of a cleaur light brown. Set it by, and use it 
as occasion may require. 

ROUX, WHITE. Prepare your butter 
and flour as above, place it on a moderately 
heated stove, stirring it constantKr till very 
hot; be careful that it does not take color at 
ail, for the whiter it is the more desirable. 

RUSKS. To three pounds and a half 
of flour allow half a pound of butter, the 
same quantity of pounded loaf sugar, and 
five spoonfiils of ^ast; mix the flour and 
sugar together; meli the butter in two pinta 
and a half of milk, and mix it with the nour,, 
then add the yeast and one beaten egg; 
work it well together; cover it, and let it 
stand for five or six hours ; take it out of 
the pan, and form it into little rolls; place 
them upon tins, and let them rise for about 
an hour; bake tliera in a quick oven, and 
when they become brown, cut them ihrough 
the middle or into tliree slices; put thaaa^ 
again into the oven to brown and crisp.

sugar. Tlie decoction of sage may be uwd 
mione as a gargle, or with vinegar and hon- 
Wf witlKMit tte Port wine; or gai-gle with 
Tin^gar and water. 

SAGO. Let it soak for an hour in cold 
water, to take off the earthy taste; pour 
that off, and wash ii well ; then add more 
water, and simmer gently until the berries 
are clear, with lemon-peel and spice. Add 
wine and sugar according to taste, and boil 
all up togetlKT. 

SAGO MILK. When well cleansed, 
boil it slowly with new milk. A small 
<]uantity will be sufficioit for a quart of milk, 
it swells so much, and when done, it sliould 
be reduced to about a pint. It requires 
neither sugar nor flavoring. 

SALAD MIXTURE. Endeavor to have 
your sahid herbs as fresh as possible ; if you 
fluspect they are not " morninff gatliered," 
they will be much refineshed by Tying an hour 
or two in spring wato* ; then carefully wash 
and pick them, and trim off all the worm- 
«aten, slim^, cankered, diy leaves; and, 
after washing, let them remain awhile in 
the colander to drain: lastly, swing them 
gently in a cloan napkin: when properly 
picked and cut, arrange them in the salad 
<liBh, mix the sauce in a soup-plate, and put 
it into an ingredient bottle, or pour it down 
the side of tlie salad dish, and don't stir it 
up lill the mouths are ready for it. 

If the herbs be young, fr^ gathered, trim- 
med neatly, and drained dry, and the sauce- 
maker ponders patiently over the following 
directions, he cannot fail obtaining the fame 
of being a very accomplished salad-dresser. 

Boil a couple of eg^ for twelve minutes, 
and put them in a basm of cold water for a 
few minutes; the yolks must be quite cold 
and hard, or tliey will not incorpoiate with 
the ingredients. Rub them through a sieve 
with a wooden spoon, and mix them with a 
table^poonful of water, or fine double cream ; 
then add two table-spoonftils of oil or melted 
butter; when these are well mixed, add, by 
degrees, a tea-spoonful of salt, or powdered 
lump sugar, and the same of made udustard: 
when these are smoothly united, add very 
gradually three tablenspoonfuls of vinegar; 
rub it with the other ingredients till Uior- 
ouglily incorporated with them; cut up the 
white of the egg^ and garnish the top of the 
salad with it. Let the sauce remain at the 
bottom of the bowl, and do not stir up the 
salad till it is to be eaten: we recommend 
the eaters to be mindiiil of the duty of masti- 



lion, without fhe due perionmnoe al

SALAD, WINTER. Wash rery dkm 

one or two heads of endive, some heads flf 
celery, some mustard and cresses ; cot thea 
all small, add a little shredded red cabbigQ^ 
some slices of boiled lieet-root, da ooioa, if 
the flavor is not disliked ; mix them togelher

and also garnish the dish with tbem. 



SALINE DRAUGHT. Salt of 
wood, twenty grains ; lemon-juicse, a tahln- 
spoonful ; wato*, two teUe-^oonluk; mag- 
nesia, twenty grains ; mix ii in a tumbkr, 
tc^ether with a little pounded sugar, and take 
two or three of these in the day. 

SALLY LUNNS. Take thiw quarts 
of dried flour, half a cupful of yeast, a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter, melted in a sufficient 
quantity of milk to dissolve it, the yolks of 
three eggs, and a little salt: make tliese iar 
gredients into a light doti^, let it stand be- 
fore the fire (covered), for an hour to nap, 
and bake in a quick oven. The above may 
be made into small cakes. 

SALMON. When sahnon is fieah and 
good, the gills and flesh are of a bri^ red, 
the scales clear, and the whole fish is sti£ 
When just killed, there is a whiteness be- 
tween the flakes, which gives great firmnem ; 
by keeping, this melts down, and the fidi 
becomes richer. 

SALMON, BAKED. Clean and eat 

the fish into slices, put it in a dish, aod make 
the followinff sauce: — Melt an ounce of but- 
ter, kneaded in flour, in a pint and a half 
of gravy, with two glasses of Port whae, two 
ta0ie.«poonful8 of ketchup, two anchovies^ 
and a little cayenne. When the anchovies 
are dissolved, strain and pour the sauce over 
the fishji tie a sheet of buttered paper 01

SALMON, BOILED. Put on a 
kettle, widh spring water enough to wcil 
cover the salmon you are going to dress, or 
the salmon will neither lode nor taste well:

When the water boils, put ui a liandnil of 
salt; take off die scum as soon as it rises; 
have the fish well washed; put it in, and if 
it is thick, let it boil very gently. SahniNi 
requires almost as much boiling as meat; 
about a quarter of an hour to a pound of 
fish : hue practice only can perieot tke «aok

ter is lioC, put salt into it, and stir it well ; 
taste it; when stroi^ enough to force you to 
eaaH it from ^our mouth, it will do; when 
the water boils put in the fish ; when it boib 
a||ain, give twenty minutes for a salmon, and 
sixteen for a gristle. When salmon is cut 
in slices an inch thick, let them boil ten 
iMMrtes. Serve with it a sauce tureen of 
de liquor the fiah was boiled in. 

SALMON STEAKS BROILED. Cut 



the steaks €nm the thick«t parti of the fiA 
nearly an inch thick ; butter pieces of while 
paper; foki die steaks in them, and broil 
them over a sbw fire for ten or twelve minutes. 
Take off tlie paper; serve and gamirth with 
plenty of firied parsley. Drened in thi» 
way, they may be put round salmon boiled, 
in slices. Sauces;— melted batter, lobster, 
or shrimp sauoe. 

SALMON, FRESH BROILED, dean 

the salmon well, and cut it into slices aboot 
sm inch and a half thick ; dry it thoroughly 
In a clean cloth; rub it over with sweet oil, 
or thwk melted butter, and sprinkle a little 
salt over it: put your gridiron over a clear 
Bve, at some distance ; when it is hot, wipe 
it clean ; rub it witli sweet oil or lard ; lay 
the salmon on, and when it is done on one 
side, turn it gently and broil the other. An- 
chovy sauce, &c. 

OoB. — ^An oven does them best. 

SALMON CAVEACH. Boil in two 
quarts of vin^^ar three heads of shallots, half 
an ounce of whole black pepper, diree cloves, 
two blades of mace, and a little salt. Fry 
the fish, cut in slices, of a li^t brown ool<v 
in fine oil, or clarified dripping; put them, 
when cold, into a pan, pour over the vinegar 
and spices, and put onHbe top eight or ten 
spoonfuls of oil. Solus may be done in this 
way, only lay over them sliced onions instead 
of shallots. 

SALMON, DRIED KIPPER. Cut the 
fish up the back, and take out the bone ; wipe 
it verv clean with a cfoth ; scMne it, and put a 
handuil of salt on each side, and let ii lie 
for three days ; then hang it up to dry, and 
it will be fit for use in two days, and eats 
well with a little pepper put over it, and 
broiled. 

SALMON, DRIED, TO DRESS. Lay 

it in soak for two or three hours, then broil 
it, shaking a little pepper over it. Dried 
salmon is eat«i broiled in paper, and only 
just warmed through ; egg sauce and moahea 
potatoes are usuuiy served with it; or it 
may be boiled, especially the bit next the 
head. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (1) Cut a 

salmon into two or three pieces, put it in 
a fish-kettle, and set it on the fire with a 
suflkient quantity of water to cover it, and 
plenty of salt; as soon as it begins to boil, 
set it aside to simmer very gently until done ; 
then take it off the fire, and let it stand in 
the liquor until cold, take it out, lay the 
pieces dose together in a tub to pickle, and. 
over them five anchovies, a small quantity 
of pounded nltpetre, and a qmrler of a

pint of «w«et oil; beikig tbut pteputed, pot 
the tc^ of the falmon iiqnor into a stewpui, 
to which add the aame qoaottty of white 
wine vinegar; put it on the fire to skim, 
«nd boil ii for two or three niinutes ; take it 
off, and Jet it cool. When cold, pour it 
over the ralmon and tie it down ; in thi«e 
days turn it, and in a week's time it will 
be fit for use ; this is merely in a small way ; 
a ^;reat quantity being done at once, requires 
neither oil nor anchovies. Serve garnished 
with fennel. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (2) Cut the sal- 
mon into pieces ; boil it as for eating, and lay 
it on a dry ck>th till the following day ; boil 
two quarts of good vinegar with one of the li- 
quor the fish was boiled in, one ounce of whole 
black pepper, half an ounce of allspice, and 
four blades of mace. Put tlie salmon into 
sometliing deep, and pour over it tlie prepar- 
ed vinegar when cold. A little sweet oil 
put upon the top will make it keep a twelve- 
month. 

SALMON, PICKLED. (8) To a quait 
of liquor the fish has been boiled in, put rath- 
er more tlian half a pint of good vinegar, and 
half an ounce of whole black pepper ; boil 
it, and when it is cold pour it over tlie^ fish, 
previously laid in aflleep dish. 

SALMON, PICKLED, TO DRESS. 
Soak a piece of pickled salmon all night 
in pump-water; then lay it on a fish-plate, 
apd put it in a stewpan, with threfe spoon- 
fiils of vinegar, a little mace, some whole 
pepper in a bit of muslin, an onion, a nut- 
meg bruised, a pint of white wine, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, some parsley, lemoM-peel, 
and a quarter of a pound of biitter rolled in 
flour ; cover the stewpan very close, and let 
it simmer over a gentle fire for a quarter of 
an hour; then take up the salmon, lav it in 
a dbh, keep it hot before the fire ; let the 
sauce ^tl till it is of a proper consistence ; 
take out the spice, onion, and sweet herbs, 
and serve the sauce over the fish. 

SALMON, POTTED. Take off the 
head ; cut the salmon in thick slices; wipe it 
dry, but do not wash it ; pound half an ounce of 
nutm^, mace, and cloves, tlie least part of 
cloves, half an ounce of white pepper, and 
some salt; chop fine one onion, six bay- 
leaves, and six anchovies ; season each slice ; 
put it into a pan, with very thin slices of 
butter between each layer; bake it, when 
well done; drain off the butter, and, when 
ooM, pour over some chirified butter. 

SALMON, TO SALT. Cut the fish up 
the back, and cut out the bone; wine it 
dean, and sprinkle it with salt; let it lay a 



nioht to drain off the liqpKHr; wipe it Ary; 
rub on it two or three ounces of pomiMl 
saltpetre ; cut it into pieces ; pack it dose in 
a pot with a thick layer of salt between eadi 
layer of fish. If, tlie brine does not rise in 
a few days, boil a stroi^ one, and pour i^ 
when cold, upon the salmon, which mMk 
always be covered witli it. 

SALMON, STEW. Clean and scrape 
the fish ; cut it into slices, and stew it in a 
rich white gravy. A little before serving, 
add two tablcHspoonfuls of sov, one of e»* 
sence of anchovy, and a little salt, some 
cho|^)ed parsley and chives. 

SALMON, SPICED. Mix tontber, in 
the proportion of one third of salt-and-water to 
one pint of vinegar, one ounce of whole black 
pepper, and one ounce of cinnamon. Qit 
the salmon into slices, and boil it in this; 
when oold, pack it cloee in a pan, aixf poor 
over it the liquor it was boiled in, with the 
spices, so as to cover it completely; cover 
tlie pan closely, to exclude tlie air. 

SALMON, MACKEREL, SPRATS, 
HERRINGS, &c. pickled. Cut tlie fieli 
into proper pieces ; do not take off the scales; 
make a brine strong enougb to bear an egg, 
in which boil tlie fish ; it most be boiled m 
only just liquor enough to cover it; do not 
oveiix)II it. When the fish is boiled, lay it 
slantingly to drain off all the liquor ; when 
cold, pack it ckise in llie kits, and fifl them 
up with equal parts of the liquor the salinoa 
was boiled in (having first well skimmed it), 
and liest vinegar; let tliem rest for a daw; 
fill up again, striking the sides of the kit wmh 
a cooper's adz, until the kit will receive no 
more ; then head tliem down as close as pas- 
sible. 

06«. — ^This is in the finest condition 
when fresh. Some sprigs of fresli-gatliered 
young fennel are the accompanimoits. 

N. B. — The three indispensable marks 
of the goodness of pickled ssdmrai are, 1st, 
The brightness of the scales, and their stick- 
ing fast to the skin ; 2dly, The femneas c^ 
the flesh; and, 3dly, Its fine, palenred loae 
color. Without tlieae it is not fit to eat, 
and was either stale before it was pickled, 
or has been kept too long after. 

The above was given us as the adod 
practice of those who pickle it for the Lon- 
don market. 

N. B. — Pickled salmon wanned by'steaa, 
or in its pickle liquor, is a fovorite dish at 
Newcastle.

and cooked in some rich sauce, and seasoned 
with pepftet, salt, nutmeg, cloves, shallots,

that all the articles are sufficiently boiled be- 
Ibre th^ are cut up. Many things, such as 
berf-paute, fowl, cocks'-combs, indeed al> 
Boat any article you please, may be added to 
the above. 

8ALT; Is as Plutarch calls it, sauce 
iir aanoe. 

Common salt is more relishing than bas- 
ket salt; it should be prepared for the table 
by clryii^ it in a Dutch oven before the fire; 
ven put it on a clean paper, and roll it with 
a rolling pin ; if you pound it in a mortar 
till it is quite fine, it will look as well as 
basket (sait. 

**,* Select for table-use the lumps of 
salt. 

Ob». — Your salt-box must have a close 
cover, and be kept in a dry place. 

SALT, SPICED. Take four drachms 
of grated nutmeg, the same of cbves, two 
of white pepper, two of allspice, two of 
mace, two of bay-leaf, two of basil, and 
two of thyme (dieae three latter articles 
ahould he dried in an oven). Pot tliese all 
into a mortar, and pound them to an impal- 
pable powder, and sift it. Take a pound 
of fine while salt, dry it thoroughly in an 
oven, or stove, pound it as fine as possible; 
nft, and mix with it an ounce of the above 
moitioned spices; amalgamate them thor- 
€iig^ly> keq) the spiced salt in a tin box, 
which will shut perfectly close. Use it m 
4he following proportimi: four drachms to a 
pound of boned veal. 

SALTING MEAT. In the $ummer 
■eason, especially, meat is frequently spoiled 
by the cook foi^etting to take dut the ker- 
nels; one in the udder of a round of beef, in 
the fot in the mtddle of the round, those 
about the thick end of the flank, &c.: if 
these are not iakea out, all the sak in the 
world will not keep the meat. 

The art of salting meat is to rub in the 
nit thfMTOOgfafy and evenly into every part, 
and to fill all the holes fiill of sak where the 
kernels were taken out, and where the butch- 
erVi skewers were. 

A round of beef of 25 pounds will take a 
pound and a half of salt to be rubbed in aU 
at first, and requires to be turned and rubbed 
every day with the brine; it will be ready 

16 



for dresm; in four or five days, if you 4b 
not wish it very salt. 

In sufiimer, the sooner meat is salted ate 
it is killed, the better; and care must be 
taken to defend it fitxn dw flies. 

In i0mf«r, it will eat the shorter and 
tenderer, if kept a few days (according to 
the temperature of the weather) until ka 
fibre has become short and tender, as these 
cfaanses do not take place after it has been 
actedf upon by the salt. 

In fi^ty weather, take care the meat is 
not fit>9Ben, and warm the salt in a firing- 
pan. The extremes of heat and cold are 
equally unfavorable for the process of salting. 
In the former, the meat changes before the 
sak can aflect it: in the latter, it is so har- 
dened, and its juices are so congealed, that 
the salt cannot penetrate it. 

If you wish it red, rub it first with sak- 
petre, in the proportion of half an ounce, and 
the like quantity of moist sugar, to a pound 
of common salt. 

You may impregnate meat with a yerf 
agreeable vegetable flavor, by pounding some 
sweet bethe, and an onion with tfae saH. 
You ma^ make it still more relishing by ad- 
ding a little ZE8T or savory tpice. 

SALT PORK, BOILED. See Bacon, 

SAMPHIRE, TO DRY, OR PRE- 
SERVE. Take it in bunches as it grows ; 
set a large deep stewnan full of water on the 
fire; as soon as it boils, throw in a little 
salt, and put in die samphire ; when it looks 
of a fine green, remove the pan directly firmn 
the fire, and take oat the samphire with a 
fork ; lay it on sieves to drain ; when cold, 
lay it on earthen plates, strew sugar well 
over it, next day torn them on a sieve, and 
strew it again with sugar, keep turning dai- 
ly until it is dry; take care the stove is not 
too hot. 

SAMPHIRE, TO PICKLE. Lay some 
samphire that is green in a pan, sprinkle 
over it two or three handfols of salt, and 
cover it with spring water, and let it lay for 
twenty-four hours ; then put it into a large 
hraaa saucepan; throw in a handfiil of salt; 
cover the pan close, and set it over a very 
slow fire; let it stand tiU it is quite green, 
and crisp; theft take it oft", for if it beocMnes 
soft it is spoiled; put it into a jar, cover it 
dose, and when it is cold, tie it down. 

SANDWICHES FOR TRAVEL- 
LERS. Spread butter, very thinly, upon 
the upper part of a stale loaf of bread cut 
very smooth, and then cut off the slice; nojir 
cut ofi* another thin slice, but spread it wira 
butter on the under side, without which pre- 
caution the two slices of bread will not fit

one another. Next take some cold beef, or 
ham, and cot it Into very mimite particles. 
Sprinkle these thickly over the batter, and, 
having added a little mustard, put the sliees 
fiux to fiice, and press them together. Last- 
ly, cut tlie whole into four equal portions, 
each of which is to be vnrapped in a separate 
piece of papa*. 

SANDWICHES. (1) Cut some bread 
into tliin slices, pare off the emit, and spread 
a little butter on them ; cut them nicely into 
oblong pieces, put between each scHue bits 
of fowl, and then thin bits of liam, both nice- 
ly trimmed; add a little mustard and salt. 
Any cold roasted or potted meat may be used. 
Serve thmn for luncheon, gamidied with 
curled parsley. 

SANDWICHES, (2) Properly prepaid 
ed, are an elegant and convenient luncheon 
or supper, but have got out of fashion, from 
the bad manner in which they are common- 
Iv made : to cot the bread neatly with a 
marp knife seems to be considered the only 
essential, and the lining is composed of any 
ofial odds and ends, tliat cannot be sent to 
table in any other form. Whatever is used 
must be carefully trimmed from every bit of 
skin, gristle, &c. and nothing introduced 
but what you are absolutely certain will be 
acceptable to the moutli. 

SANDWICHES, CAKE. Cut a sponge 
cake, a few days old, as for bread sand- 
widies, and spread strawben-y jam or cur- 
rant jelly over them. 

SAUCE. (1) Few things require more 
care than making sauces, as most of tliem 
sliould be stirred constantly, the whole atten- 
tion should be directed to tliem ; tlie better 
way therefore, is to prepare die sauces before 
cooking those articles which demand equal 
care ; they may be kept hot in tlie 6am- 
marie. 

Butler, and those sauces containing egga, 
ought never to boil. 

The thickest stewpans should be used for 
making sauces, and wooden-spoons used 
for stirring them. 

SAUCE. (2) Mix together a pint of 
vinegar, two shailbts or heads of garlic, a 
tea-spoonful of cayenne, three large table- 
qioonfiils of Indian soy or mushroom ketch- 
up, and two of walnut pickle. Let it stand 
a week, shaking it daily; strain, and bottle 
it for use. 

FOR ANY SORT OF MEAT. 



ANCHOVY. Pondthrae m- 

chovieB in a mortar with a little bit of bsl- 
ter ; rub it through a doable hair sieve wkk 
tlie back of a wooden spomi, and sdr it into 
almost lialf a pint of melted butter ; or stir 
in a table-epoonfiil <^ essence of anchofj. 
To the above, many cooks add lemoD-joise 
and cayenne. 



Boil and strain three table-spoonfuls of ^ra- 
▼y, two of vinegar, a blade of mace, a htUe 
pepper, salt, and a lai-ge sliced onion. 



APPLE, (1) Pare, core, and 

slice some aisles ; boil them in water, wilk

add to them a bit of butter the sixe of a 
wahiut, and some brown sugar. Heat, and 
serve in a sauce-turem. 



APPLE. (2) Pare and core 

three good-sized baking apples; put then 
into a well-tinned pint sauoepony with tiro 
table-epoonfiils of cold water; cover lbs 
saucepan close, and set it on a triv^ over a 
slow fire a couple of hours hehre dimter 
(some apples will take a long time slewing, 
others will be ready in a quarter of an hour): 
when tlie apples are done enough, poor off 
the water, let tliem stand a few minotes tD 
get dry ; dien beat them up with a fork, 
with a bit of batter about as big as a not- 
mcs, and a tea-spoonful of powdered smv. 

N. B. — Some add lemon-peel, gratedl or 
minced fine, or boil a bit with the apples. 



ATTELETS. Take of finely- 



minced parsley, mushrooms, and shallots, a 
table-spoonfiil each ; fry them with a little bulp 
ter, and tlien dredge in a little flour ; raoistta 
tlie mixture with some good stock, seasoi

and add the well-beaten yolks of two or 
three eggs. Stir it well aU the time it ii

ounce of butter, and a middling-eized omoa; 
on this lay a pound of nice, ysacj graiy 
beef, (as the object in making gravy is to 
extract the nutritious succuloioe of the meat, 
it must be beaten to comminute the contui^ 
ing vessels, and scored to angmmt the M> 
face to the action of the water) ; cover thi 
stewpan, and set it on a slow fire; wlM 
the meat begins to brovra, torn it aboa^

It stew Tei^ gently fen- about two hours, 
then strain it through a sieve into a basin. 
Now, if you wish to thicken it, set a clean 
stewpan ova: a slow fire, with about an 
ounce of butter in it; when it is melted, 
dredge to it, by degrees, as much fiour as 
will dry it up, stirring ihem well together; 
when thoroughly mixed, pour in a little 
gravy — stir it well togetlier, and add the re- 
mainder by degrees ; set it over the fire, let 
it simmer gently for fifteen minutes longer, 
fllcim off the fat, &c. as it rises ; when it is 
about as thick as cream, squeieze it through 
a tamis or fine sieve — and you will have a 
fine rich Brown Sauce, at a very moderate 
expense, and without much trouble. 



FOR BOILED BEEF. Mince 

a large onion, parboil it, and drain off the 
water; put the onion into a saucepan, witli 
a table-spoonful of finely-chopped pursley, 
some good gravy, and one ounce of butter

two of steaks, two or three pounds of veal, 
some pickings of fowl, carrots, and onions, 
put all these into a saucepan with a glass 
of water, and set it on a brisk fire ; when

slow fire, that the jelly may take color with- 
out burning; and as soon as it is brown, 
moisten it with stock (or water), add a 
bunch of parsley and green onions, two bay- 
leaves, two cloves, and some champignons, 
salt it well, and set it on the fire for three 
hours, then strain ; dilute a little roux with

pany may not like it, stir it into a quarter 
of a pint of thick melted butter, or thicken-

CHESTNUT, FOR ROAST 



TURKEY. Scald a pound of good chest- 
nuts in hot water for five minutes, skin them, 
and stew them slowly for two hours in white 
stack, seasoned amf thickened with batter 
and floor. Cut a pound of pork sausages 
into bits about an inch Ions, dust them with 
flour, and fiy them a li^t nrown; lay them 
into the dish on which the turkey is to be 
served, ai|^ pour the chestnuts and sauce 
over them. Some people prefer the fiied 
sausages stewed a little with the diestnutB; 
bat this method makes the sauce of a darker 
color.

7-; CURRANT, FOR VENISON. 

Boil in water for a few nunutes an ounce of 



sufficient quantity of curry powder, into gi«> 
vy or melted butter, or onion sauce, or otam 
gravy. The compositions of curry powder, 
and the palates ot tlioee who eat it, vaiy so 
much, that we cannot recommend any wpf 
cific quantity. The cook must add it fay 
degrees, tasting as she proceeds, and take 
care'not to put in too miidi. 

DUTCH. (1) Beat op the y«*i 

of six eggs, mix in a little floor, cream, sak. 



and lemon vinegar. Strain it throng a

EGG. (1) This agreeable 



paniment to ittasted poultry, or salted fish, 
IS made by putting three eggs into boiling 
water, and boiling them for about twehe 
minutes, when tliey will be hard ; put than 
into cold water till you want them. This 
will make the yolks firmer, and prevent 
their suHace turning black, and yoo can col 
them much neater: use only two of the 
whites, cut the whiles into snoall dice, the 
yolks into bits about a quarter of an iaeb 
square; put them into a sauce-boat; poor 
to them half a pint of melted butter, and 
•tir them tugeiher. 

If you are for soporlative ^g sauee, 
pound the yolks of a couple of eggs, and rib 
them with the melted butter to tbi<^«Q it

ESCHALOT. Take four 



chalots, and make it in the same manner as 
garlic sauce. Or, you may make this sauce 
more extemporaneously by putting two table- 
qx>onful8 of eschakjt wine, and a sprinkling 
of pepper and salt, into (almost) half a pint 
6i thick melted butter. This is an excellent 
Bailee for chops or steaks; many are very 
fond of it with roasted or boiled meat, 
poultry', &c.

ED MUTTON. This is a very fivquent 
and satisfoctocy substitute for caper sauce.

of the best white wine vinegar ; add the peel 
of a lemon, oA very thin. When cold, pot 
tbe whole into a bottle, cork it tightly, and 
ihake it well before using. 



FOR FISH. (1) The mehed 

batter for fish, should be thick enoush to ad- 
here to the fish, and, therefore, must be of the 
thickness of light batter, as it is to be dilut- 
ed with essence <^ andiovy, soy, mushroom 
ketchup, ca^ne, or Chili vinegar, lemons 
or lemon-joice, or artificial lemon-juice, &c. 
which are expected at all well-served tables. 
Cooks, who are jealous o( the reputation of 
their taste, and housekeepers who value their 
health, will prepare these artwles at home: 
there are ouite as manv reasons why th^ 
ifaoald, as there are for toe prefo«nce usually 
given to home4)aked bread, and home-brew- 
ed beer. The livo: of the fish pounded andi 
nhced with parsley and butter, with a little 
lemon-juice, &c. is an elegant and inofiensive 
relish to fish.

FOR HASHES OF MUTTON 

OR BEEF. Unless you are quite sure you 
perfectly understand the palate of those you 
aia working for, show those who are to 
eat the hash diis receipt, and beg of thenkto 
direct yoo how they wish it seasoned. 

Half the number of the ingredients enu- 
inerated wiQ be more than enough : but as it 
is a receipt so often wanted we have given 
variety.

You may garnish it with firied bread sippetk 

N. B.— To hash meat in perfection, it 
should be laid in this gravy only just long 
enough to get properly warm through. 

0S«.— If any of the gravy that was seal 
ap with, or ran from the joint when it was 
roasted, be left, it will be a great improva- 
ment to the hai^. 

If you wish to make mock venison, instead 
of the onion, put in two or three cloves, a 
table-spoonfiil of currant jelly, and the sama 
quantity of claret or Port wine, instead of

cember) ; peel them and cut them in half, 
and lay them in a pan of spring water for a 
quarter of an hour, and then boil for a quar* 
ter oiaia hour; and then, if you wish them 
to taste very mild, pour oflf tliat water, and 
cover them with fresli boiling water, and let 
them boil till they are tend^, which will 
sometimes take diree-quarlen of an hour 
longer. 



ONION. Boil twelve or more 

onions in water; when it boils, pour it off, 
add more hot water, and when die onions 
are tender, strain and mash tliem in a bowl, 
add a piece of butter, a little salt, and one 
or two spoonfuls of cream. Heat it before 
serving. An ef^le may be boiled with the 
OPions. 



■ ■ ONION, OR ONION GRAVY. 

Peel and slice the onions (aome put in an 
equal quantity of cucumber or celery) into a 
quart stewpan, with an ounce of butter; set 
it on a slow fire, and turn the onim about 
till it is very lightly browned ; now gradually 
0tir in half an ounce of flour; acM a littK 
broth, and a little pepper and salt; boil np 



for a few miiMlia; add a taMe-epaoalhl «# 
claret, or Port wine, and same of mob* 
room ketchup, (you ma^ sharpen it with a 
little lemoQ-joice or vinegar), and rub it 
through a tamia or fine sieve. Ctarry powder 
will convert this into excellent curry sauce. 

N. B. — ^If this sauce is for steaks, shred 
an ounoe of onions, fry them a nice brown, 
and put them to the sauce you have rubbed 
throi^ a tamis; or some vc^ small, round* 
young silver button onions, peeled and boil- 
ed tender, and put in whole when your sauce 
is done, will be an acceptable addition. 

06t.— If yon have no broth, put in half a 
pint of water, and just before you give it the 
last boil up, add to it another tableHspoonfid! 
of mushroom ketchup, or the same quantitf 
of Port wine or good ale. The flavor of 
this saoee may be varied by adding tarragon 
or buniet vinegar.

ORANGE GRAVY, for wili> 

Ducks, Woodcocks, Snipes, WiDe*

al^, or lemon, Iwif a tea-spoonfol of salt, 
the same of pepper, and a glass of red wine ; 
send it up hot. Eschabt and cayenne may 
be added. This is an excellent sauce foir 
all kinds of wild watei^fowl. 

Gravies should adways be sent up in a 
covered boat: they keep hot longer; and it 
leaves it to the dioice of the company to 
partake of than or not.

cessary to make sauce: the above composi- 
tion of the several articles from which the

found a very admirable extemporaneous sub-

thin slices of beef; rub with butter the bot- 
tom of an iron stewpan that has a cover to

plenty of the suet and some onions small : 
mix all these materials very well together, 
with a handfol or two of the dried meal; 
spread them on the table, and season them 
properly with salt and mixed spices; take 
any of the scraps of beef that are left from 
mincing, and some of the water that boiled 
the draught, and make about a choppin («'. e.

If you think the bag is tliin, you may put 
it in a cloth. If it is a large haggis, it will 
take at least two hours boiling.

when it is clear, which may be in about a 
ftHtnight, bottle it off for use. If the or- 
anges are very ripe, a pound and a half of 
sugar is sufficient.

068. — In making this siru]), if the sugar 
be dissolved in the infusion with as gentle a 
heat as possible, to prevent the exhalation 

17* 



of the vohKtile pnlr of the neel, this simp 
will pos w s s a great share or the fine flavor

ening. 

(mu, — The proportion of sugar ordered in 
the above sirup is a quarter prand more than 
that directed in the Phnranoopcsia of the 
Londm College of l^ysicians. The quanU- 
ty of si^r must be as much as the liquor is 
capable of keeping dissolved when cold, or 
it will ferment, and quickly spoil: if kept in 
a temperate degree of heat, the above pro- 
portion of sugar may be considered the basis 
oi all sinqif .

some are fond of the brains. Snipes are 
generally dressed in the same manner as 
woodcocks.

«¥er the iish, so that theiy cover every part, 
take up the fidi by the head, and shake off 
the loose crambs. The fish is now ready 
for the frying-pan, into which put a quart 
or more of IreA sweet olive oil, or clar- 
ified butter, dripping, lard, or clarified drip- 
pings; be sure that they are quite sweet 
and perfectly clean (the fiu oa%ht to oover 
the fish): what we here order is for soles 
about ten inches long; if kirger, cut them 
into pieces the proper size to help at table ; 
this will save much time and trouble to the 
carver: when yon send tliem to table, lay 
ikeva in the same form tli^ were belbre they 
were out, and you may strew a little cm-led 
paraiey over them: they are much easier 
managed in the frying-pan, and require lees 
fiit: fry die thick part a few minutes before 
yon put in the thin, you can by this means 
only fry the tiiick part enot^h, without fry- 
ing the tbin too mudi. Very large soles 
riKHiid be boiled, or fried in fillels. Soles 
cut in pieces, crossways, about the size of a 
smelt, make a very pretty garnish for stewed 
fish and boiled fish. 

Set the frying-pan over a sharp and clear 
fire ; wsoch it, skim il witli an e^^slice, and 
when it boils^ i. e. wlien it has done bi^ 
blingf, and the smoke just be|;ins to rise from 
die sur&ce, put in the fish: if tlie fat is not 
extremely hot, it is impossible to fry fish 
of a good color, or to keep them firm and 
crisp. 

Tlie best way to ascertain die heat of the 
fat, is to tiy it with a bit of bread as big as 
a nut; if it is quite hot enough, the bread 
will brown immediately. Put in the fish, 
and it will be o'isp and brown on the side 
next the fire, in about four or five minutes ; 
to torn it, stick a two'pronged f<Nrk near the 
head, and support the tail with a fish-slice, 
and fiy the other side nearly the same length 
of time. Fry one sole at a time, except the 
pan is very large, and you have plenty of fat. 

When the fish are fried, lay diem on a soft 
cloth (old table-clotfis are best), near enough 
the fire to keep diem warm; turn them 
tivery two or diree minutes, till they are 
quite dry on both sides; this common cooks 
commonly neglect. It will take ten or fifteen 
minutes, if the fat yon fried Uiem in was not 
hot enough ; when it is, they want very Utile 



diyiag. Wkn foies uw Iried, llwy «tt 
keep very good in a drv plaoe for tfaraear 
four davs; warm them by ban^^ing them on 
the hookc in a Dutoh oven, letting them hmt 
very giadually, by putting it some distance 
from the fire fiw aboitt twenty minutes, or io 
good g«a\'y, as eels, Wiggy's way. 

06«.— -There are several general rules io 
this receipt which apply to all fried fish: 
we have been very partknilar and mini^ in 
our directions ; ftir, although a fried sole ia 
so frequent and fiivmrite a dish, it is veiy 
seldom brought to table in perfection. 

SOLES, TO BOIL. A fine, fi«sh, diiek 
sole is almost as good eating as a turbot* 
Wash mid clean it nicely; pot it hito a fish- 
kettle with a handful of salt,* and as much 
cold water as will cover it ; set it on the side 
of the fire, take off the scum as it rises, and 
let it boil gently ; about five minutes (aooord- 
ing to its size) will be long eooiwh, ua]e» 
it he ver^ large. Send it up on a mli-draia* 
er, garnished with slices of lemon and sprigs- 
of curled parsley, or nicely-fried smelts, or 
oysters. 

06s.— Slices of lemon are a universally 
acceptable garnish with either fried or broiJ* 
ed fish: a few sprigs of crisp par8% may be 
added, if you wiidi to make it look very 
smart ; and parsley, or fennel and batter, are- 
excellent sauces, or chervil sauoe, or anchovy. 

SOLES, TO DRESS MAIGRE. Put 
die fish into a stewpan, with a laiige onion, 
four cloves, fifteen berries of allspice, and dte* 
same of black pepper; just cover them with 
boiling water, set it where they will simmer 
gently for ten or twenty minutes, according' 
to tlie size of the fish ; strain off the liquor 
in another stewpan, leaving the fish to kee(> 
warm till the sauce is ready. Rub together 
on a plate as much flour and butter as will 
make the sauce as thick as a double cream.. 
Each pint of sauce season with a gkiss of 
wine, half as much mushroom ketohup, a tea- 
spoonful of essence of anchovy, and a few 
giains of cayenne; let it boil a few minutes^ 
put the fish on a deep dish, strain the gravy 
over it; garnish it widi sippets of bread 
toasted or fried. 

SOLE, Carp, Trout, Perch. Eel,. 
OR Flounder, to stew. When the fish 
has been properly washed, lay it in a stew- 
pan, with lialf a pint of claret or Port wioe» 
and a quart of good eravy, a large onion, a 
dozen berries of black pepper, the same of 
allspice, and a few cloves, or a bit of maoer 
cover die fish-kettle ckiee, and let it stew 
gently for ten or twenty minutes, according 
to the diickness of the fish: take the fish up, 
lay it on a hot di^h, cover it up, and thicken 
the liquor it was stewed in with a litiki

SORREL, TO STEW. Strip the leaves 
from the stalks, wadi them well, scald them 
in boiling water in a silver saucepan, cr in 
an earthon pijAin ; strain and stew them m 
a little gravy till tender. Sen'e with hard- 
boiled e^ cut in quarters. 

SORREL, IN GRAVY. Mince» and 
put it into a saucepan, with butter, bacon, 
parsley, and scallions; add a glass of con- 
somme; set it over a moderate fire, and 
when quite soft, put to it some fowl gi^vy, or 
veal blond. Make the sauce thick, and do 
not let it boil, cover the sorrel when ser^'ed. 

SQRREL OMELET. Pick, wash, and 
blanch some sorrel, cut it in pieces, and 
dry it lightly in a little butter, with shred 
pnrsl^ and scallions; then put tlie sorrel 
into a saucepan, with a little cream ; season, 
and let it boil slowly; in tlie meantime make 
an omelet in the usual way, lay it on a dish, 
thicken the sorrel witli the yolks of two eggs, 
poor it <m the omelet, and ser\'e it very hot. 

SOUFFLET, APPLE. Prepare apples 
as for baking in a pudding, put them into a 
deep dish, and lay upon the top, about an 
inch and a half diick, rice boiled in new 
milk with sugar; beat to a stiff frotli the 
whites of two or three eggs, with a little 
sifted kiaf sugar, by it upon the rice, and 
bake it in an oveifa light brown. Serve it 
instantly when done. 

SOUFFLET, RICH. Soak in white 
wine and a little brandy, sweetened with su- 
|rar, some slices of sponge cake; put tb»n 
into a deep dish, and pour over them a rich 
custard; beat to a stiff froth the whites of 
three or four eggs, and with a table-spoon 
hy it over the top in heaps to look roo^; 
brown it in a Dutch oven, and serve quickly. 

SOUFFLET, RICE. Soak in half a 
pint of milk, for an hour, one ounce of rice, 
and the ped of a lemon cut thin; put it into 
a saucepan, with a little salt, and add by 
degrees a pint of new milk, and a bit of but- 
ter the sise of a walnut; stir it till it boil, 
and for five minutes after. When cool, add 
the yolks of six eggs, beaten with two table- 

rmfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and stir in 
well4)eaten whites of the eggs, and dress 
the soufflet in the dish like a pyramid. 



Bake It hi an oven. It may be nade 
two table-spoonfuls of potato flour, w^idi 
mix with a little milk, and a little salt, and 
then thkiken it over the fire with more i 
put a little orange-fiower water, or any

it, and when cold, mix in two taUe-epoon- 
fuls of orange marmalade; beat well six 
eg^ with a glass of brandy; mix all togeth- 
er; put it in a buttered shape; place it in 
a saucepan of boiling water, over a stove; 
let it boil one hour and a quarter without a 
cloth or cover over it. 

SOUPS. Every utensil employed in a 
kitchen must be kept scrupuloa^ clean, 
and a cook ought to take especial care that 
all her saucepans be in good order. Braaa 
pans are preferaUe for preserving in, and 
double block tin are the best sort in use for 
every other prnTxise ; their covers, dioukl be 
made to fit closely, and the tinning alwam 
renewed as soon as it is observed to tm 
wearing off. While new, they may be 
easily kept clean by washing them regularly . 
in hot water, and ruUl>ing on them vriien > 
quite dry, a little whiting with lettdwr or 
flannel. After long use, they will retfiiire 
occasional scouring with fine sand; and be- 
fore they are used, they ought ahvays to be 
rinsed out with hot water, and wiped with 
■a clean cloth. A landhuly will find it good 
economy, and for her advantage in odier 
respects, to provide plenty of stone ware and 
eaithen vessels, and also common dnfaes for 
the kitchen, that the taUe set may not he 
used to keep cold meat on. 

In boiling soup, less water is used in a 
digester than in a common pot, as in a di- 
gester no steam can escape. 

To extract tlie strength fit>m meat, long 
and slow boiling is necessary, but care must 
be taken that tbe pot is never off the boiL 
All soups are better for being made the day 
before they are to be used, and th^ sbonU 
then be strained into earthen paiis. Whan 
soup has jellied ixt the pan, it should not be 
removed into another, as breakii^ it wiU 
occasion its becoming sour sooner than k 
would otherwise do; when in danger of not 
keeping, it should be boiled up. It newr 
keeps long with many vegetabh^ in it. Us 
meat used for soups or broths cannot be tw 
fresh. Wlien any animal food is |ihii ^ 
boiled, the liquor, willi the addition of tks 
trimmings of meat and poultry, make good 
soups and gravies, as do also the bones of 



sours

mmatad or broiled meat.' The gravief left 
in the diahes aoawer finr haafaee, and the 
Jiqaor in which veal has been boiled, nray 
be Boade iato a glase by boiling it with a 
bam bone till reduced to a thii'd or fourth 
jpartf and aeasoaiog it with the Deceeniry 
Lerbfl and spioeB. 

In boiling weak soups, the pan should be 
tmoovered tlmt the wateiy particles may 
escape. Cow-heel jelly improves eveiy 
flort of rich soup; and for thickening, truf- 
fles, morels, and dried mushrooms, may be 
seed with advantage. 

Directi<»s are given with each of the 
Allowing soups for thickening with flour 
and butter, oream and eggs; after the ci'eam 
and eggs are added, the soup must not be 
•llowed to boil. 

Should brown gravy or mock Unrtle ^oup 
be spoiling, fresh-made charcoal, roughly 
pounded, tied in a little bag and boiled with 
either, will absorb the bad flavor and leave 
k sweet and good. The charcoal may be 
made by simply putting a bit of wood into 
the fire, and pounding the burnt part in a 
mortar. 



ASPARAGUS. This is made 

with the points of asparagus, in the same 
manner as the green pease soup is with 
pease: let half the asparagus be rubbed 
through a sieve, and the otlier cut in pieces 
about an inch long, and boiled till done 
enough, and sent up in tiie soup: to make 
two quarts, there must be a pint of heads 
to thicken it, and half a pint cut in ; take 
care to preserve tliese green and a little 
crisp. This soup is sometimes made by 
adding the asparagus heads to common pease 
•oup. . 



BEEF, THICK. In eight quarts 

of water boil gently for seven hours, skim- 
ming it well, a sliin, or a leg of beef, and a 
bunch of sweet herbs ; strain it the next day, 
take off* the fat, and cut all tlie gristly and 
sinewy parts fix>m the bones, add them to 
the soup with some leeks, onions, celery, 
pepper, salt, and ten or twelve ounces of 
Scotch barley parboiled; boil it gently for 
two or three hours. This stock or jelly will 
keep good for weeks in cold weather. 



BEEF OR MUTTON. Bofl 

nry gently in a closely covered saucepan, 
fimr quarts of water, with two table-«poon* 
fills of sifted bread raspings, three pounds 
of beef cot in small pieces, or tlie same 
quanti^ of muttoa chops takm from the 
middle of the neck; season with pepper 
and salt, add two turnips, two carrots, two 
onions, and one head of celery, all cut small ; 
let it stew with these ingredients four homn, 
vAnBtk it will be ready tQ serve. 



BEET ROOT. Boil tifl tmAtt 

two roots of beet, and mb off* the skin with 
a coarse towel, minoe them finely, as abo' 
two or three onions ; add this to five pinta 
of rich gravy soup, so as to make it rather* 
thick, then stir in three or fijor table-spooa* 
fuls of vinegar and one of brown sugar ; let it 
boil, and throw in some fi-icandnllans made- 
up in the form of corks, and rolled in fk>ur. 



AND BOUILLI. The best 

parts for this pnrpoae, we the hs or shin,, 
or a piece of die middle of a brisket of 
beef, of about iieven or ei^^it pounds' weigtu ; 
lay it on a fish drainer, or when you take it 
up, put a dice under it, which will enable^ 
yuu to place it on the dish entire ; put it in- 
to a souppot or deep stewpan, with cold 
water enough to cover it, and a qoart over^ 
set it on a quidi fire lo get the scorn up, 
which remove as it rises ; then put in twa 
carrots, two turnips, two leeks, or twiv 
large onions, two heads of celery, two or 
tlu-ee cloves, and a feggot of paraley and 
sweet herbs ; set the pot by tlie side of the 
fire to simmer ^-ery gently, till tlie meat is 
just tender enoqgli to eat ; this will require 
aboia four oi* five hours. 

Put a brge carrot, a turnip, a large onion, 
and a head or two of celery, into the soup 
whole,— take them out as soon as they are 
done enough, lay them on a dish till they are 
cold, tlien cut them into small squares:— 
wlien the Beef is done, take it out careful- 
ly, — strain the Soup through a hair sieve 
into a clean stewpan, take off tlie fat, and 
pot the vegetables that are cut into the- 
soup, the flavor of which you may heighten^ 
by adding a table-cpoonful of mushromn 
ketchup. 

If a Thickened Soup is preferred, take- 
four laige tablenspoonfuis of the clear &t 
from the top of tlie pot, and fiair spoonfuk 
of flour; mix it smooth together, then'bv 
degrees stir it well into the soup, which 
simmer for ten minutes longer at least,— ^ 
skim it well and pass it thi-ougb a taniia,, 
or fine sieve, ana add the vegetables and 
seasonii^ the same as directed in the dear 
soup. 

hjeep the beef hot, and send it up (as a. 
remove lo the soup) with finely chopped 
paraley sprinkled on the top, and a sauce* 
boat of Wow Wow sauce. 



BROWN, WITHOUT Meat*. 

Put three quarts or more of water, with a. 
sOfficient quantity of raspings to thicken it;

BROWN GRAVY. (1) Take 



£fteen pounds of a leg or shin of beef, cut off 
tlie meat in bits, rub the bottom of the pot 
■with butter, put in the meat, let it brown 
ibr nearly an hour, turning it constantly, 
hveak the bone and take out tlie marrow, 
which may be kept for a pudding, but it is 
•considered better than butter to brown the 
meat with ; put to it ibuiteen quaits of cold 
water, and the bones ; when it boils, skim 
it perfectly clean, and add six goofi-sized 
red onions, one carrot cut in three, one 
iiead of celery, a good handful of wliole 
black and Jamaica pepper mixed; let this 
boil very gently ten or twelve hours closely 
^»vered, if upon a fire, but if done upon a 
liot plate, not to be covered ; strain it through 
a cullender, and then through a hair sieve, 
into a large pan, to be kept for use. Re- 
turn tlie meat and bones into tlie pot with 
three or four quarts of hot water ; let it boil 
nearly two hours, and strain it off. This 
makes good stock ibr gravies, stews, or 
•any made dishes. 

This gravy soup keeps perfectly good for 
tliree or four weeks. When it is to be 
trailed to send to table, first boil vermicelli, 
or macaroni, in a little salt and water, till 
tender; strain it, and add it to the soup 
just before serving. This soup is quite 
pure, and requires no clearing. It is a 
most convenient thing to have in a house in 
cold weather, as it is always ready for use ; 
and, sen'ed with dry toast to eat with it, 
makes an acceptaUe luncheon. 

The trimmings of meat, giblets, and bones, 
may be boiled with the beef for this soup. 



BROWN GRAVY. (2) Cut 

down three pounds of gravy beef, and put it 
wi in a etewpan with three onions cut small, 
and two ounces of butter; let it brown well, 
Miiring it to orevent the onions from burn- 
ing; then aad four quarts of water, one 
head of celery, of carrots and turnips two 
each, with some whole black pepper and 
gait ; boil it gently for four hours ; strain it ; 
and the next day take off the fot. When 
it is heated, add some vermicelli, previously 
boiled in water, and aerve it after boiling 
fiBQ minutes.

CARROT. Scrape and wash 

half a doaen lar|;e carrots ; peel off the red 
outside (which is the only part used for this 
soap); put it into a gallon stewpan, with 
one head of celery, aiMl an onion, cut into 
thin pieces; take two quarts of beef, veal, 
or mutton broth, or if you have any cold 
roast beef bones (or liquor, in which mutton 
or beef has been boiled), you may make very 
good broth for this soup: when you have 
put the broth to the roots, cover the stewpan 
dose, and set it on a slow stove for two 
bours and a half, when the carrots will be 
soft enough (some coaka put in a feea-cupfol 
of bread-crumbs) K boil for two or three 
minutes; rub it through a tamis, or hair 
neve, with a wooden spoon, and add as much 
broth as will make it a proper thickness, 
u e. almost as thick as pease soup: put it 
into a clean stewpan; make it hot; season 
it with a little salt, and send it up with 
some toasted bread, cut into pieces half an 
inch square. Some put it into the soup; 
but the best way is to send it up on a plate, 
as a aide dish. 



CJELERY. Split half a dozen 

heads <^ celery into dips about two inches 
long; wash them wdl; lay them on a hair 
sieve to drain, and put them into three quarts 
of clear gravy soup in a gallon soup-pot ; set 
it by the side of the fire to stew very gently 
tiA the celery is tender (this will take about 
an hour). If any scum rises, take it off; 
season with a little salt. 

O&t.—- When celery cannot be procured, 
half a drachm of the seed, pounded fine, 
which may be considered as the essence of 
celery, put in a quarter of an hour before the 
soup is done, and a little sugar, will give as 
much flavor to half a gallon of soup as two 
heads of celery w^ighinf seven ounces, oir 
add a little essence of eefery. 



COCKY-LEEKY. Take a 

■erag of mutton, or shank of veal, three 
J qoarts of water (or liquor in which meat has 
J been boiled), and a good sized fowl, with 
I two or three leeks cut in pieces about an 
, inch loi^, P^IV^ '^ ^^ » ^i^ slowly about 



an hour: then pot in as many more leeksy 
and ^ve it three4]uarten of an hour longer; 
this IS very good, made of good beef stock, 
and ledu put in at twice. 



CRAWFISH. This soup i« 



sometimes made with beef, or veal broth, or 
with fifdi, in the following manner: Take 
flounders, eeb, sndgeons, 8ic., and set them 
on to boil in ookl water ; when it is pretty 
nigh boiling, diim it well; and to three 
quarts put in a couple of onions, and as many 
carrots cut to oieoes, some parsley, a doaen 
berries of black and Jamaica pepper, and 
about half a hundred craw>fi^ ; take off the 
small claws and shells of tfie tails; pound 
them fine, and boil them with the broth 
about an hour; strain off, and break in 
some crusts of bread to thicken it, and, if 
you can get it, die spawn (^ a lobster ; pound 
It, and put it to the soup; let it simmer very 
gently for a coa|^ of minutes; put in your 
craw-fish to get hot, and the soup is ready. 



CRESSY. (1) Wash clean, 

and cut small, eight carrots, eight turnips, 
tliree heads of celery, and six onicms ; put 
them in a stewpan with a quarter of a pound 
of butter and a slice of ham, stew diem 
gently for an hour, stirring them constantly: 
when they begin to brown add as much 
gravy soup as will fill the tureen ; let it boil 
till the vegetables are sufficiently tender to 
pulp with a spoon through a sieve, after 
which put it on the fire and boil it half an 
hour, sKin, and season it with pepper and 
salt. This soup should be as thick as melt- 
ed butter. Two pounds of beef boiled in 
four quarts of water till reduced to three, 
will answer for the soup. 



CRESSY. (2) Slice twelve

The broth should be of a fine amber color, 
and as clear as rock water. If it is not 
quite so bright as you wish it, put it into a 
stewpan; break two whites and shells of 
eggs into a basin; beat them well together; 
put them into. the soup: set it on a quick

then set it on one side of tlie fire to settle

into a basin, and it is i^eady* 

However^ if your broth is carefully skim* 
med, &c. according to the directions above 
given, it will be clear enough witliout clari- 
fying; which process impaira the flavor of 
it in a higher proportion than it improves 
its sq)pearanee. This is the basis of almost 
all gravy soaps, which are called by the 
name of the vegetables tiiat are put into tiiem. 
Carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and a few 
leaves of chervil, make what is called spring 
soap, or soup sante ; to this a pint of green

with macaroni or vei'micelli, or celery cut

rouody or young ooions, will give you a clear 
turnip or ooion soup ; and all these vegeta- 
bles mixed together, soup 6 res si. The 
roots and v^^ables you use must be boiled 
first, or they will impr^[nate the soup with 
too strong a flavor. The seasoning for all 
these soups is the same, viz. salt and a very 
little cayeone pepper. 



' GAME. Id the game season, it 
is easy for a 000k to give a very good soup 
at a veiy little expense, by taking all the 
meat off the breasts of any cold binis which 
have been left the pieced ing day, and pound- 
ing it in a mortar, and beating to pieces the

broth for an hour. Boil six turnips; mash

with the meat that has been poimded in a 
mortar; strain ^pour broth, and put a little 
c^ it at a tine mto the tamis to help yon to 
strain all <€ it diroiigh. Put your soup-ket- 
tle near the fire, but do not let it boil: when 
ready to dish voor dinner, have six yoUui of 

18 



eggs roixfid with half a pint of cream; ginlt

and as it is coming to boil, put in the eggs, 
and stir well with a wooden spoon: do not 
k|t it boil, or it will curdle. 



HARE. Cut the hare in joinCa 

as for a fricassee, and put it in a stewpan, 
with a little altsptoe, three blades of mace, 
some salt, and whole black pepper, a bunch

winter savory, four quarts of water, a slice 
of ham, and four pounds of lean beef, twa 
carrots, and four onions cut down; let it

rate the hare, and strain the soup over it, 
and add a pint of Port wine; boil it up be-

half a pound of butter and three carrots cot 
small, some salt and pepper ; let them stew 
cioeely covered for half an hour, shaking 
tliem occasionally to prevent their adhering 
to the pan ; fry in butter six cucumbers cat 
longways in four pieces ; add them with four 
quarts of liot water, half a French roll, and 
a crust of bread toasted upon both sides; 
and let the wliole boil till reduced to three 
quarts, tlien strain it through a sieve; beat 
up the yolks of four eggs with lialf a pint 
of cream, and stir it gently into the soup just 
before serving.

of each. Some add to tlie above bay-leaves 
and celery-seed, a drachm each. Dry them 
in a warm, but not too hot Dutch oven: 
wbea quite dried, pound them in a mortar, 
and pass them throu^ a donUe hair sieve ; 
pat them in a bottle ckisely stopped, they 
will retain their fragrance and flavtur for 
several months. 

Ofrs. — This composition of the fine aro- 
matic herbs is an invaluable acquisition to 
tbe cook in those seasons or situations when 
fresh herbs cannot be had ; and we prefer it 
to the ragout powder. It impregnates saose, 
soop, &c. with as much relish, and renders 
it agreeable to the palate, and refreshes the 
gustatory nerves, without so much risk <tf 
ofliending the stomach.

Elkm of soup half a pint of wine ; mis sboukl 
Madeira, or, if you wish to darken the 
color of your soup, claret, and two taUe- 
spoonfols of lemou-juioe; let it simmer gently 
tdl the meat is tender; this may take from 
half an liour to an hour: take care it is not 
over-done ; stir it frequently to prevoit the 
meat sticking to the bottom of the stewpan, 
and when the meat is quite tender the soup 
is ready. 

A head weisliing twenty pounds, and tea 
pounds of slock meat, will make ten quarts 
of excellent soup, besides the two quarts of 
stock you have put by (or made dishes. 

Obs. — If tb^i e is more meat on tlie head 
than you wish to put in the soup, prepare it 
for a pie, and, with the addition of a calf's 
foot boiled tender, it will make an excellent 
ragout pie; season it with zest, and a little 
minced onion, put in half a tea-cupful of 
stock, cover it with puff paste, and bake it 
one hour: when the soup comes from table, 
if there is a deal of meat and no soup, put it 
into a pie-dish, season it a little, and add 
some little stock to it; then cover it with 
paste, bake il one hour, and you have a 
good mock turtle pie. 

To season it, to each gallon of soup put 
two table-spoonfuls of lemon-juice, same of 
mushroom ketchup, and one of essence of 
anchovy, half a pint of wine (tills ^ould be 
Madeira, or, if you wish to darken the color 
of your soup, claret), a tea-spoonful of ciiny 
powder, or a quarter of a drachm of cayenne, 
and the peel of a lemon pai-ed as thin as 
possible; let it simmer five minutes more, 
take out the lemon-peel, and the soup is ready 
for the tureen. ' 

While the soup is doing, prepare for each 
tureen a dozen ^nd a half of mock turtle 
forcemeat balls, and put them into tlie tureen. 
Brain balls, or cakes, are a very elegant ad- 
dition, and are made by boiling the brains 
for ten minutes, tlien putting them in cold 
water, and cutting them into pieces about as 
big as a large nutmeg ; take savory, or lemon 
thyme dried and finely powdered, nutmeg 
grated, and pepper and salt, and pound them 
all together; beat up an egg, dip the brains 
in it, and then roll them in this mixture, and 
make as much of it as possible stick to them ; 
dip them in the egg again, and then infinely- 
erated and sifted bread-cnimbs; fry them in 
hot fot, and send them up as a side dish. 

A veal sweetbread, not too much done or 
it win break, cut into pieces the same size 
as you cut the calPs head, and put in the

ful of mushroom ketchup, a tea-spoonlul of 
salt, half a tea-spooiiful of ground black 
pepper, as much grated nutmcs as will lie 
on a sixpence, and a slass of Madeira or 
Sherry wine; let it all simmer together for 
five minutes longer. Forcemeat or egg balls 
may be added if you please. 

A pound of veal cutlets, or the belly part 
of pickled pork, or nice double tripe cut in- 
to pieces about an inch square, and half an 
tntii thick, and rounded and trimmed oeat- 
lyfrom all skin, gristle, &c. and stewed till 
they we tander, will be a great addition* 



half a pound of fresh butter, with six large 
onions sliced, three cbves of garlic, soma 
chopped parsley, and sweet mai'joram, into 
a stewpan, let it stew over a sk>w fire till 
of a light brown color; cut in small pieces 
five pounds of lean beef, and let that stew 
till the gravy be extracted, and then put in 
three quarts of boiling water, and iia/f a 
pound of Scotch barley, and let it simmer 
four hours very slowly; mix four table- 
spoonfuls of curry-powder with cold water, 
and add it to the stock ; take out the beef^ 
and rub the barley throush a sieve, to thick- 
en the soup. Cut a fowl in joints, skin it, 
and put it in a stewpan with n piece of but- 
ter, and let it stew till quite tender; the 
stewpan roust be kept closely covered: tarn 
to be added to the soup, the last thing, with 
a pint of boiling milk, and the juice of two

with this soup. 



MULLAGATAWNY. (2) 

Make a strong stock of tlie b(mes of roasted 
beef, mutton, and fowl ; while it is prepar* 
ing, put into a slcMrpan, with eix oanoes of 
butter, three quarts of sliced turnip, t«o 
quaits of carrots, and eight Iat:ge ooioos 
also sliced ; let tliem stew upoo the stote till

strain it through a tammy clotii, with 
two wooden spoons, taking care that m 
bones be left amongst the vegetablea; if toa

it has boiled a little, draw it to the sidv 
of the stove, and let it siamaery tliat ths 
fi;reaae may be taken off. A little good 
beef stock, in addition to that made of tht 
bones will be an improvemuit. It is souif 
times thickened with whdb or ground rice, 
instead of bread, and ought to be 
upon a stove. *

siAed flour of rice, and a little salt ; boil it 
gently for half an hour, stirring it constantly, 
and a little before serving, stir in half a pint 
of rich O'eaib. 



OX-HEAD, Should be pi«- 

pared the day be^Nie it is to be eaten, as you 
cannot rut the meat off the head into neat 
mouthfuls unless it ia cold: therefore, the 
day before you want this soup, put half an 
oxHJieek into a tub of cold water to soak 
for a couple of hours \ then break the bones 
diat have not been iMviken at tite butcher's, 
and wash it very well in %varm water; put 
it into a pot, and cover it with cold water; 
when it boils, skim it very clean, and tliea 
put in one head of celery, a couple of cairots, 
a turnip, two large onions, two doien ber- 
ries of black pepper, same of allspice, and 
a bundle of sweet herbs, such as marjoram, 
lemon thyme, savory, and a handfnl of pars* 
ley ; cover the soup-pot clone, and set it (»n a 
slow fire; take off tlie scum, which will rise 
when it is coming to a boil, and set it by the 
fireside to stew very gently for about tliree 
hours; take out the liead, lay it on a dish, 
pour the soup throi;^h a fine sieve into a 
stone-ware pan, and set it and the head by 
in a cool place till the next day ; then cut 
die meat into neat mouthfuls, skim and stniin 
oflT the broth, put two quarts of it and the 
meat into a clean 8tew|»n, let ir simmer very 
gently for half an hour bnger, and it is 
ready. If you wish it thickened, put two 
ounces of butter into a stewpan ; when it is 
melted, throw in as much flour as will dry it 
up; when tliey are all well mixed toother, 
and lMx>wned by degrees, pour to this your 
soup, and stir it well together ; let it simmer 
for half an hour longer; strain it through a 
hair sieve into a clean stewpan, and put to 
it the meat of the head; let it stew Imlf an 
hoar longer, and season it witli cayenne 
pepper, salt, and a glass of good wine, or a 
tabie-fipoonibl of brandy. If you serve it as 
soup for a dozen people, thicken one tureen, 
and send up the meat in that ; and send up 
the otlier as a clear gravy soup, with some 
of the carrots and turnips shredded, or cut 
into shapes. 

OX-HEEL, Must be made the 

day before it is to be eaten. Procure an 
OK-heel undressed, or only scalded, and two 

18* 



that have beea boiled m they nmlly are at 
the tripe shops. 

Oit the meat off the boiled heehi into neat 
moothfiils, and set it by on a plate; put the 
trimmirits and bmies in a stewpan ^ with threa 
quarts of water, and the unboiled heel cut into 
qoartere } furnish a steH'pan with two onions, 
and two turnips pared and sliced ; pare off 
the red part of a couple of large carrots, add 
a couple of esdialots cut in half, a bunch of 
savory or lemon thyme, and double the quan- 
tity of parsley ; set this over, or by the side 
of a dow, steady fire, and keep it closely 
covered and simmering very gently (or the 
soup liquor will evaporate) for at least seven 
hours: during whidi, take care to remove 
the fot and scum that will rise to tlie surface 
of the soupi which must be kept as clean as 
possible. 

Now strain the liquor through a sieve, 
and put two ounces of butter into a clean 
stewpan ; when it is melted, stir into it as 
much flour as will make it a stiff paste ; add 
to it by dq^rees the soup liquor; give it a 
boil up; strain it througn a sieve, and pu| 
in tlie peel of a lemon pared as thin as pos- 
sible, and a couple ot bov-leaves, and the 
meat of the boiled necis ; let it go on sim- 
mering for half an hour longer, t. e. till the 
meat is tender. Put in the juice of a lemon, 
a glass of wine, and a table-spoonful of mush- 
room ketchup, and the soup is ready for the 
tureen. 

lliose who are disposed to make this a 
more substantial dish, mav introduce a 
couple of sets of goose or auck giblets, or 
ox-tails, or a pound of veal cutlets, cut into 
moutlifuls. 



OX-TAIL. Three tails, ooeting 

about 2d. each, will make a tireen of soup 
(desire the butcher to divide than at the 
joints) ; lay them to soak in warm wateri 
while you get ready the vegetables. 

Put into a gallon .stewpan eiffht ck>ves, 
two or three onions, half a draoim of all- 
spice, and the same of black pepper, ^nd 
tne tails: cove»them with cold water; skim 
it carefully, when and as king as you see 
any scum rise; then covor the pot as close 
as possible, and set it on the side of the 
fire to keep gently simmering till the meat 
becomes tender and will lc»ve the bonet 
easily, beoemse it is to be eaten with a spoon, 
without the assistance of a knife or fork ; this 
will require about two houi-s: mind it is not 
done too much: when perfectly tender, take 
out the meat and cut it off tlie bones, in 
neat mouthfiils ; skim the broth, and 'strain 
it tlirougli a sieve; if you prefer a thicken- 
ed soup, put flour and butter, as directed in 
the preceding receipt; or put two table- 
spoonfuls of the fat you have taken off the 
broth into a clean stewpan, with as mnch

you have well skimmed it, and it is quite 
smooth, then strain it through a tamis into 
a clean stewpan, put in the meat, with a 
table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, a glass

yea must have thi'ee tails for a tureen, some 
put an ox-cheek or tails in an earthen 
pan, with all tlie ingredients as above, and 
send them to a slow oven for five or six 
hours. 



J- PEAS, GREEN. (1) A peck of 

peas will make you a good tureen of soup. 
In shelling them, put the old ones in one 
basin, and tlie young ones in another, and 
keep out a pint of them, and boil them 
separately to put into your soup when it is 
finished: put a large saucepai^ on the fire 
half full of water ; when it boils, put the 
peas in, with a handful of salt; let them 
ix>il till they are done enough, i. e. from 
twenty to thirty minutes, according to their 
age and size; then drain them in a colan- 
der, and put them into a clean gallon stew- 
|)an, and three quarts of plain veal or mut- 
ton brotli (drawn from meat without any 
spices or herbs, &c. which would overpow- 
er the flavor of the soup); cover the stewpan 
close, and set it over a slow fire to stew 
gently for an hour ; add a tea-cnpful of bread 
crumbs, and tlien rub it through a tamis in- 
to another stewpan ; stir it with a wooden 
spoon, and if it is too thick, add a little 
more broth: have ready lx)iled as for eating, 
a pint of young peas, and put tliem into tlie 
soup ; season with a little salt and sugar. 

Some cooks, while this soup is gomg on, 
slice a couple of cucumbera (as you would 
for eating) ; take out the seeds ; lay them 
on a cloth to drain, and then flour tliem, 
and fry them a light brown in a little but- 
ter ; put them into the soup the last thing 
before it goes to table. 

If the soup is not green enough, pound a 
handful of pea-hulls or spinage, and squeeze 
the juice through a cloth into the soup: some 
leaves of mint may be added, if approved. 



. PEAS, GREEN. (2) Put a 

pint of old green peas into three quarts of 
water, a slice of the crumb of bread, two 
onions, a t^prig of mint, some salt and pep- 
per; boil them till the peas are perfectly 
soft, then pulp them through a sieve ; have 
ready two lettuces stewed tender in butter, 
A and a pint and a half of young green peas 
boiled; put tliem into the soup with a little 
spinach juice, and a quarter of a pint of 



the kiioc of the youngest peapodiy

tlie water you boik^d tlie poaa in; stir al 
well together; let it Imil up for about five 
minutes, and then rub it tiiroagh a hair sieve 
or tainis. If the peas are g<M)d, it will be 
as thick and fine a vegetable soup as need 
be sent to table. 



PEAS, OLD. (1) Putaponod 

and a half of split peas on in four qnails of 
water, with roast beef or mutton bones, and 
a ham bone, two lieads of ce)ery, and fom 
onions, let them boil till the pens be soffi* 
ciently soft to pulp through a sieve, strain ic, 
put it into the f>ot witli pe]:^per and saU, and 
boil it nearly an hour. Two or three Imnd- 
fiils of spinach, well washed and cot a little, 
added wlien the sou|) is strained, is a great 
improvement; and in tlie sumnoer young 
green peas in place of the spinach. A tea- 
spoonful of celery seed, or essence of celery^ 
if celery is not to be had. 



PEAS, OLD. (2) Boil io fi%e

and bruise them with tlie back of a spoon till 
all is pulped through, then boil the soup geot* 
ly for one hour belore serving. Thin slioei 
of bread toasted and cut in dice to be serred 
with it, either upon a dish or in the soap;

; — PEAS, PLAIN. To a quart 

of split peas, and two headii of celery (and 
most cooks would put a large onion), put 
three quarts of broth or soft water; let them 
aiuuncr gently on a trivet over a slow fire 
for three hours, stirring up every quarter of 
ao hour to prevent the peas burning at the 
bottom of tlie soup-kettle (if the water boils 
aiva^, and tlie soup gets too thick, add some 
ixkiling water to it) ; when tlicy are well sof> 
tened, work tliem tiiroogh a coarse Meve, 
and then tlirough a fine sieve or a tamis; 
wash out ^our stewpan, and tlien return the 
soup into it, and give it a boil up ; take off 
any scum tliat comes up, and it is ready. 
Prepare fried bread, and dried mint, as di- 
rected in Old Peas (2) and send them up 
with it on two side dislies. 

Obs. — ^This is an excellent family soup, 
produced witii very little trouble or expense. 



PIGEON. (1) Have a strong beef 



stock, highly seasoned, and if for rich soup, 
take six or eight pigeons according to tlieir 
size, wash them clean, cut off the necks, pin-

tlie stock; quarter tlte pigeons and brown 
them nicely; afler having strained the stock, 
put in the pigeons; let them boil till nearly

of lemon juice or of vinegar, and one of 
mushi-oom ketchup; let it boil a few minutes 
after all tliese ingredients are put in, and 
serve it witli the pigeons in tlie tureen; a 
better thickening than fiour is to boil quite 
tender two of the pigeons, take off all the 
meat and pound it in a mortar, rub it tlirough 
a sieve, and put it, witli the cut pigeons, 
into tlie strained soup. To make partridge 
soup, partridges may be substituted for pig-

extremely well. 

SOUR KROUT. The beet cabbage for 
tliis purpose is the dram, or white Straa- 
burgh. and it sliould not be used till it has 
endured some severe frost; the stocks are 
then cut ifito halves, and shred down as fine 
as possible with a knife, or more properly 
witli a plane made in the form oi a cucumber 
slice. Bum a little juniper in a cask or tub 
which is perfectly sound and clean, and put 
a little leaven into the seam round the bot- 
tpm, — flour and vinegar may be substituted 
for the leaven ; then put in three or four 
handfub of cabbage, a good sprinkling of 
salt, and a tea-spoonful of caraway seed, and 
press this hard with a wooden mallet; next 
add another layer of cabbage, with salt and 
caraway seed, as at first ; and so on in the 
same manner until the cask be full, pressing 
down each layer firmly as you advance. A 
good deal of water will come to the tup, of 
which a part may be taken off. The cask 
being full, put on the head so as to press 
npon llie cablnge, and place it in a warm 
cellar to ferment ; wlien it has worked well 
for three weeks, take off the scum which 
will have gathered on the top, and by a 
clean cloth on the krout ; replace the head, 
and put two or three heavy stones upon it. 
The juice should always stand upon tiie top. 
Thus in a good cellar it will keep for years. 
When to be dressed, it is boiled for five or 
six hours in water, or stewed with a little 
gravy, and may be also substituted for a 
crust over a beef-steak pie, when cheese is 
grated over it. 

SOUR KROUT WITH PIKE. When 
tlie krout is boiled, clean a large pike, 
scrape and cut it into neat pieces, dip them 
into. the beaten yolk of an egg, then into 
bread crumbs, and fry them of a nice brown ; 
rub some butter upon a dish, and put into 
it a layer of krout, and some grated cheese, 
then a layer of pike, and a littk sour cream ; 
then krout, and so on till the dish be full. 
On the top put some bits of butter, and 
some good brotli or gravy ; strew crumbs 
of bread thickly over it, and bake it half 
an hour. 

SPANISH PUFFS. Put into a sauce- 
pan, half a pint of water and a quarter of 
a pound of butter ; stir it till it boils, and 
mix in four table-spoonfub of flour; stir it 
well together, and add six yolks and four 
whites of ^gs, two at a time; let it cool, 
and, with a dessert-spoon, drop it into boil- 
ing clarified dripping or lard. 

To make ginger puffs, a tea-spoonfiil of 
pfHinded finger way be added.

pcNRid all tlieae Co^iether to a paste, put it 
mio a didb, and mix with it a few dry cur- 
rants, and three or four spoonfuls of melted 
imtter. Cot some slices of bresid half an 
inch thick, four inches long, and two broad ; 
toast them nicely, and sfwead the spinach, 
•^c. over them, to the thickness of half an 
inch, wash each over with white of egg; 
place the toasts on a baking-tin (well btitter- 
-ed) and bake them for half an hour. When 
done, grate nutmeg, and squeeze orange-juice 
'Over them, and serve. 

SPRATS, TO BAKE. Clean Uiem; 
lake oflf the beads; put them into a deep 
dish, and cover tliem with vin^ar and wa- 
ter, equal quantities of each. To a quart of 
liquid, put half an ounce of whole black pep- 
per, a little allspice, two or three bay-leaves, 
Bonoe salt, and an onion. Tie paper over 
the dish, and bake tliem in a cool oven, or 
do them over a slow fire in a water bath. 
Hen-ings may be done in this way. Both 
will keep good some weeks. 

SPRATS, STEWED. Wash and dry 
yoar sprats, and lay them as level as you 
can in a stewpan, and between every layer 
of sprats put three peppercorns, and as many 
allspice, with a few grains of salt ; barely 
cover them with vinegar, and stew them one 
hour over a slow fire; they must not boil: 
a bay-leaf is sometimes added. Herrings or 
mackerel may be stewed the same way. 

SPRATS, BROILED. If you have not 
a sprat gridiron, gel a piece of pointed iron 
wire as thick as {lacktliread, and as long as 
vour gridiron is broad ; rnn this throi^h the 
heads of your sprats, sprinkle a little flour 
and salt over them, put your gridiron over a 
clear, quick fire, turn tliem in about a couple 
of minutes ; when die other side is brown, 
draw out the wire, and send up the fish with 
aielted butter in a cup. 

O&s. — ^That sprats are 3^oui^ herrings, is 
evident by their anatomy, in which ibae is 
no perceptible di fference. They appear very 
soon after the herrings are gone, and seem 
to be the spawn just vivified.

STEAKS OR CHOPS. See Chops. 

STOCK, FOR BROWN OR WHITE 
SOUPS. Take a pound of scate, five floun- 
ders, and two pounds of eels ; cut them in 
pieces, pot them into a stewpan, with as 
much water as will cover them, a little mace, 
an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, 
two parsley rtmts sliced, some pepper and 
salt, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover 
close ; strain it off for use ; if it is for brown 
soup, fry the fish brown in butter, and then 
put it to stew. 

STOCK, FOR GRAVV SOUP OR 
GRAVY. CXit a knuckfe of veal into sli- 
ces, slice also a pound of lean beef, and a 
pound of the lean of gammon of bacon ; put

carrots, a couple of onions, a couple of tur- 
nips, two heads of celery, and two quarts 
of water. Let the meat stew till quite ten- 
der, but it must not be brown. When thus 
pepared it will serve either for soup, or 
Drown or white gravy ; if for brown gravy, 
it must be first colored in the usual manner.

t.- 



a wine-glaiM of water, twice a day, when 
you feel languid, t. e. when the stomach is 
empty, about an hour before dinner, and in 
the evening. This agreeaUe aromatic tonic 
is an effec^ve help to concoction ; and we 
are under personal obligations to it, for fre- 
quently restoring our stomach to good tem- 
per, and procui'ing us good appetite and pood 
digestion. In low nervous anections arising 
jGrom a languid circulation, and when the 
8tomach is in a stale of debility from age, 
intemperance, or other causes, this is a most 
acceptable restorative. 

N. B. — ^Tea made with dried and bruised 
orange-peel, in the same way as common 
tea, and drank with milk and sugar, has 
been taken by nervous and dyspeptic p^- 
i^nc with great benefit. Sucking a bit of 
dried orange-peel about an hour before din- 
ner, when the stomach is empty, is very 
grateful and strengthening to it. 

STRAWBERRY CREAM. Put six 
ounces of strawberry jam to a pint of cream, 
pulp it through a sieve; add to it the juice 
of a lemon, whisk it fast at the edge of a 
disli, lay the froth on a sieve, add a little 
more juice of lemon, and when no more froth 
will rise, put the cream into a dish, or into 
glasses; aiid place the froth i^n it, well 
drained. 

STRAWBERRIES AND RASPBER- 
RIES. From either of these fruits agree- 
able wine may be obtained, by following the 
rules given for makinig currant wine; but it 
will be found a cheaper and a better meth- 
od, to add a Jittle simp or juice of tlie fruit 
to any flavorless currant wine; when tJie 
fermentation begins to decline, currant wine 
may also be flavored with odorif^ous flow- 
ers, such as cowslip, elder, or mignionette. 
The quality of roughness is communicated 
by catechu and keoo, chips of oak and of 
beech, and also the sloe; a small quantity 
of these, or of the flowers, is put into tbie 
gask when the first fermentation is over, and 
as soon as the wine has acquired the desired 
flavor, it is racked and fined. The flavor- 
ing articles, such as orris-root, cloves, sin- 
ger, sweet and bitter almonds, are put uto 
. a muslin bag, and hung in the cask for a 
few days, during the stage of insensible fer- 
mentation, that IS, after die first fermentation 
has ceased; care being taken to taste the 
liquor frequently, so that the flavoring mat- 
ter may be withdrawn as soon as it has pro- 
duced the desired efEscU

SUO 



TuRKKT, Fowl, fce. Ninoe a (|aaner 
«ra pound of beef suet (beef marrow is bet- 
ter), the same weight of bread crumbs, two 
drachms of parsley leaves, a drachm and a 
half of sweet marjoram or lemon thyme, and 
€he same of gmled letnon«peel and onion 
chopped as fine as poesible, a little pepper 
and salt; pound thoroughly together with the 
yolk and white of two eggs, and secure it 
IB the veal with a skewer, or sew it in with 
a bit of thread. Make some of it into balls 
or sausages; flour them, and boil, or fry 
them, and send them up as a garnish, or in 
a side dish, with roast potthry, veal, or cut- 
lets, &c. 

N. B.-^This is about the quantity (br a 
tiirkey poult: a very lai^ turkey will take 
neai'ly twice as much. To tlie above may 
be added an ounce r)f dressed ham ; or use 
eqiKil |»rt8 of die above stuffin? and pork 
sausage meat pounded well togeUier. 

Ob$. — Good stuffing has always been con- 
sidered a chief thing in cookery: it has given 
immortality to 

** Pi'or Roger FoitUrjWho 'd a generous mind, 
Nor would Bubniit to have his hand confin'd, 
But aimel at hII, — yet never roiild excel 
In any thing but stuffing of bis veal." 

STUFFING FOR HARE. Two oun- 
ces of beef tuet chopped fine; three ounces 
of fine bread crumbs ; parskry, a drachm ; 
CKhalot, half a drachm ; a drachm of mar- 
joram, lemon divme, or wintm* savory; a 
amchm of gratecl lemon^peet, and the same 
oTpeppor and tah: mix these with the white 
ahd yolk of an egg; do not make it thin- 
it must be of cohesive consistence: if your 
stuffing is not stiff enough, it will be good 
lor nothing: put it in the bare, and sew it 
np. If the liver it quite sound, you may 
pirboir.it, and mince it very fine, and add 
It to the above. 

STURGEON, BAKED. Clean, and 
tike the skin firrnn a small stni^geon ; split it 
dong the belly, without separating it. Lay 
it in a large bakinff dish, season it witn 
ak, pepper, pounded sweet herbs; moisten 
with oil, lemon-juioe, and a bottle of white 
wine. Put it in the oven, baste it frequent- 
ly; make it a nice cokNr, and serve it with 
itB own gravy. 

STURGEON, FRESH, TO BROIL. 
Oit it into cutlets; rub them with tfaB yolk 
of an egg beat op; eCrew them over with 
aooie parsley, minced very fine, and mixed 
with grated bread crumbs, pepper, aod saJt; 
pot them into pieces of white paper battered, 
and broil than gently. Sauces ;•— oyster, 
iBehed butter, and anchovy. 

STURGEON, FRESH. The best mode 
19 ' 



of dressing this, is to have it cut in dun 
slices like veal cutlets, and broiled, and rub- 
bed over with a bit of butter and a little 
pepper, and served very hot, aind eaten with 
a squeeze of lemon-juice. Great care, how- 
ever, must be taken to cut off tlie skin be- 
fore it is broiled, as the oil in the skin, if 
burned, imparts a disgusting flavor to the 
fish. The flesh is very fine, and comea 
nearer to veal, perhaps, than even turtle. 
Stur^n is frequently plentifiil and reason- 
able lu tlie London shops. We prefer thig 
mode of dressing it to the more savory one 
of stewing it in rich gravy, like caip, he. 
which overpowers the peculiar flavor of the 
fish. 

STURGEON, ROASTED. Take a 
large piece of sturgeon, or a whole small 
one, clean and skin it properly ; lard it with 
eel and anchovies, and marinade it in a 
white wine marinade. Fasten it to the 
spit, and roast it, l»sting frec|uently with 
the marinade strained. Let the fish be a 
nice color, and serve with a |)epper sauce. 

SUET TO KEEP FOR A TWELVE- 
MONTH. Choose the firmest part, and 
pick it free from skin and veins. Put it 
into a saucepan, and set it at some distance 
from the fire, in order that the suet may 
melt without fi*) ing, or it will taste disagree- 
able. When it is melted, pour it into a pan 
of cold water. When it has caked quite 
hard, wipe it very dry, fold it in fine papor, 
and tlien in a linen bag, ami keep it in a 
dry, but not in a hot place. When you wirii 
to use it, scrape it fine, and it will make a 
nice crust, eitho* with or without butter. 



SUET MILK. Oit into very 
shavings one ounce of fi^esh beef suet; di^ 
solve it slowly over the fire in one pint of 
milk, U^ther widi a bit of lemon-peel and 
cinnamon ; sweeten with pounded feaf sqgar. 



SUET DUMPLINGS. This 

should he made the same as for suet pod- 
ding, (second receipt), but much thicker, let 
your ckHli be wetted, shake it ail over with 
floor, and tie up in several ports ni the cbdi, 
ae much as it will hokl, two or three ■peen- 
fuls of batter. Or you may make the batter 
as usual, and pnt it in tea-cops, well hotter* 
ed; tie them in cfoths, and boil an boor. 



SUGAR, TO CLARIFY. To 

three poonds of k»f sugar, aUow the beatea 
white of one egg, and a pint and a half of 
water ; break the siigsur imafl, pot it BoOe a 
nicely-cleaned brass pan, and pour the water

brandy, and a teanspoonfiil of brown sugar, 
or clarified sirup; a little grated nutmeg or 
gingw may be added, and a roll of very diin- 
cut lemon-peel. 

Obi. — ^Befbre our readers make any re- 
marks on this composition, we bw of than 

IB* 



to tarts it: if the materiab are good, and 
their palate vibrates in unison with our own, 
they will find it (Mie of tbepleasantest bever- 
ages they ever put to their lips; and, as Lord 
luithven says, " this is a nght gossip's cup 
that fiir exceeds all the ale that ever Mother 
Bunch made in her life-time." 

THICKENING. Cbrified butter is beet 
for this purpose; but if you have none readjr, 
put some fresh butter into a stewpan over a 
slow, clear fire; when it is melted, add fine 
flour sufficient to make it the thickness o€ 
paste; stir it well together with a wooden 
spoon for fifteen or twenty minutes, till it is 
quite smooth, and the color of a guinea: this 
roust be done very gradually and patiently; 
if you put it over too fierce a fire to hurry it, 
it will become bitter and empvreumatic : pour 
it into an earthen pan, and keep it for use. 
It wiU keep good a fortnight in summer, and 
longer in winter. 

A brge spoonful will generally be OMMig^ 
to thicken a quart of gravy. 

Obi, — This, in the French kitdien, is 
called rotcr. Be particularly attentive in 
making it; if it gela any burnt smell or 
taste. It will spoil every thing it m put into. 
When cold, it should w thicK enough to cut 
out with a knife, like a solid paste. 

It is a very essential article in the kitdien, 
and is the baisis of consistency in most made* 
dishes, soups, sauces, and ragouts; if the 
|rravies, &c. are too thin, add this thicken- 
mg, more or less, according to the consistence 
you would wish them to have. 

Mem. — In making thickening, the less 
butter, and the more flour you use, the bet- 
ter; they must be thoroughly worked to- 
gether, and the broth, or soup, Sec. yon pot 
them to, added by degrees: take especial 
care to incorporate them well tc^ther, or 
your sauces, &c. will taste floury, and liave 
a disgusting, greasy appearance: therefore, 
aAer you have thickenecl your sauce, add to 
it some broth, or warm wator, in the pro- 
portion of two table-«poonfuls to a pint, and 
set it by the side of the fire, to raise any fat, 
&c. that is not thoroughly incorporated with 
the gravy, which you must carefiill^ remove 
as It comes to the top. This is called 
cleansing, or finishing the sauce. 

Half an ounce of butter, and a table-spoon- 
fiil of flour, are about the proportion for a 
pint of sauce to make it as thick as cream. 

N. B. — ^The fot skimmings off the top 
of the Iroth-pot are sometimes substituted 
for butter ; some cooks merely thicks their 
soups and sauces with flour. 

TIMBALE. Pot a pound of flour on 
the slab, make a hole in the middle of it, 
into which pour a little water, diree or four 
spoonfuls of oil, a quarter of a pound of bat-

red pepper instead of black pepper, and less 
chopped onion.] 

TOMATO KETCHUP. (3) One gal- 
lon skinned tomatas, four tableHspoons of 
•alt, four do. black pepper, two do. allspice, 
eight pods red pepper, eight table-epoons of 
mustard seed. Tliese articles to be bruised 
&ie and simmered sbwiy in a pint of vinegar 
three hours ; tlien strained dirou^h a hair 
sieve. To be stewed down to half a gallon 
of ketchup. 

TOMATAS, METHOD OF PRE- 
SERVING. (1) A sufficient quantity of salt 
is dissolved in spring or river water to make 
it strong enough to bear an eg^ ; select per- 
fectly ripe tomatas, and place them well and 
without pressing them, in a stone or glazened 
earthen pot, with a deep plate in such a 
manner that it presses upon tlie fruit, and by 
this simple process tomatas may be preserved 
more than a year without attention. Before 
cooking them they should be soaked in fresh 
water for several hours. 

TOMATAS, METHOD OF PRE- 
SERVING. (2) Gather them carefully 
without bniising ; put them in a stone jar, 
Imd pour in strong brine, to the top — putting 
on a light weight to keep them gently pressed 
down below tlie suiface of the brine. Soak 
them in fresh water and cook them in the 
nsual way, seasoning to suit the taste, as 
wlien fitsh fix>m the vine. 

TOMATA MARMALADE. Gather 
full-gi'own tomatas while quite green ; take 
oat the stems and stew them till soft; rub 
them through a sieve; put the pulp on the 
fire, seasoned highly with pepper, salt and 
powdered cloves; add some g-arlic, and stew 
all together till thick. It keeps well, and is 



excellent for seafloniiig graviei. Besides tW 
numerous modes of preparing this deJicioui 
vegetable for the table, it may be stewed, 
after being peeled, with sugar, like cranber- 
ries and goosebeiries, (miducing a tart equal 
to either of those fiiiits. Tomataa make 
good pickles, pickled green ; to peel them, 
pour boiling water on them, when the skin 
will come offeaaWy, 

TONGUE. (1) A tongue which has 
not been dried will require very little soak- 
ing, but if dried, it should be soaked in 
water for three or four hours ; then put it 
into cold water, and let it boil gently till 
tender. 

TONGUE. (2) A tongue is so hard, 
whether prepared by di-ying or pickling, that 
it requires much more cooking than a ham; 
nothing of its weight takes so long to dress 
it pro|ierly. 

A tongue diat has been salted and dried 
should be put to soak (if it is old and very 
hard, 24 hours before it is wanted) in plen- 
ty of water ; a green one firesh from the pic- 
kle requires soaking only a few hours: put 
your tongue into plenty of cold water ; let 
it be an hour gradually warming ; and give 
it from three and a half to four hours* very 
slow simmering, according to the size, Sec. 

Oba. — When you choose a tongue, en- 
deavor to learn how long it has been dried 
or pickled, pick out die plumpest, and that 
which has the sni4)0thest skin, which de- 
notes its being young and tender. 

Tlie roots, &c. make an excellent relish 
potted, or peas soup. 

TONGUE, TO STEW. Wash it veiy 
clean, and rub it well with common salt and 
a little saltpetre ; let it lie two or three days, 
and then boil it till 4he skin will pull off. 
Put it into a saucepan, with part of the li- 
quor it has been boiled in, and a pint of 
good stock. Season with black and Ja- 
maica pepper, and two or three pounded 
cloves; add a glass of white wine and a 
table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and 
one of lemon pickle ; thicken the sauce with 
butter rolled in flour, and poui* it over the 
tongue. 

TONGUE, PICKLED, GLAZED. 

Boil a lar^ tongue till it be tender, skin 
and glaze R, and serve it with mashed tur- 
nips on one side, and mashed carrots, or 
carrots and spinach on die other. 

TONGUE, POTTED. See Ham. 

TONGUES, TO SALT. Salt two 
tongues, and turn them every day for four or 
five days; then rub them with two ounces 



TRI 



224 



TRI 



of commoii nk, one f^ brown flugar, and half 
an ounce of saltpetre ; turn them daily, and 
in a fortnight they may be used. 

The be^ sort of vessel for salting them 
in is an earthen-ware pan, as wide at top 
as bottom, so that the tongues may lie in it 
long-ways. 

TRIFLE. (1) Add to a pint of rich 
cream a tea-cupful of white wine, sweeten it 
with pounded loaf sugar, whisk it well, and 
as the froth rises lay it upon a sieve pbced 
over a deep dish; as it drains, pour the 
cream into the pan in which it is whisked 
till all is done ; dip some sponge biscuit, rata- 
fia cakes, or Savoy biscuit, into sweet wine 
and a little brandy; pour over tliem a lich 
boiled custard, and when quite cold, lay on 
the whipt a-eam, piled as high as possible. 
Colored comfits may be sti*ewed over the 
top. 

TRIFLE. (2) Mix three tabte-spoon- 
fuls of white wine, and one of sugar, with a 
pint and a half of thick cream ; whisk it, 
and take off as much fi-oth as will heap upon 
the dish, into which lay some pieces of 
sponge cake, or some sponge biscuit, soaked 
with sweet wine, and covered with preseiT- 
ed strawberries, or any other fruit; pile the 
froth upon this, and pour the remainder of 
the cream into tlie bottom of the dish ; gar- 
nish with flowers. 

TRIFLE. (3) Cover tlie bottom of 
the dish with Naples biscuits, and muca- 
roons, broke in halves, wet with brandy and 
white wine, poured over them ; cover them 
with patches of raspberry jam ; fill the dish 
with a good custard, then whip up a sylla- 
bub, drain the froth on a sieve; put it on 
the custard, and strew comfits over all. 

TRIPE. Take care to have fresh tripe; 
cleanse it well from tlie &t, and cut it into 
pieces about two inches broad and four long; 
put it into a stewpan, and cover it ivith 
milk and water, and let it boil gently till it 
is tender. 

If the tripe has been prepared as it usual- 
ly is at the tripe shops, it will be enough in 
about an hour, (this depends upon how k>ng 
it has been previously boiled at the tripe 
shop) ; if entirely undressed, it will require 
two or three hours, according to the age 
and quality of it. 

Maike some onion sauce in the same man- 
ner as you do for rabbits, or boil (slowly by 
thomselves) some Spanish or the whitest 
common onions you can get ; peel them be- 
fare you boil them ; wlien they are tender, 
which a middling-sized onion will be in 
about three-quartera of an hour, drain them 
in a hair sieve, take off the top skins till 



they look oice and white, and pot 

witn the tripe into a tureeo or aoup-dbl^ 
and take on the &t if any floats on die 
suriace. 

Obi. — ^Rashers c^ bacon, or fried 
saees are a very good accompaninoent to 
boiled tripe, oow-meb or calf's feet, "^ 
Kelly's sauce or parsley and butter, or 
per sauce, with a little vinegar and 
tard added to them, or salad mixture. 

Tripe holds the same rank among aolidn, 
that water gruel does among aoops, and the 
former is desirable at dinner, when the ht* 
ter is welcome at suppei*. 

TRIPE, TO FRY. Cut it into bits 
three or four inches square; make a latter 
thicker than for pancakes, of three eggs 
beaten up with flour and milk, a little nk, 
pepper, and nutmeg; dip in the tripe, and 
fiy it in butter, or firesh dripping, of a li^ 
wown color. Serve it garnished with pan^ 
ley. Sauce; — melted butter with lemoo 
pickle in it. 

TRIPE PIE. Lay into the botmin of 
a dish some thinly-sliced cold or nw ham, 
then put in a layer of tripe with the jelly 
adhering-to it, season with pepper and sal^ 
and add a bit of butler; fill the dish in this 
manner, and put in a few table-epoonlids 
of brown stock; cover the dish with poff 
paste. A beefsteak may be'^substibited lor 
the ham, laid into the bottom, and the dish 
filled up with tripe. 

TRIPE, TO BOIL. Clean it extreme- 
ly well, and take off the lat; let it lie a 
night in salt-and-water, again wash it well, 
and let it lie in milk-and-water for the same 
length of time; then cut it into small pieces, 
• oil and tie tliem widi thread; put then, 
V. <>li a clean-waslied marrow-bone, into a 
liiifii bag; tie it ck)eely, and put it into a 
stewpan that has a cover to fit quite close- 
ly, fill it up with water, and Jet it boil 
gently for six hours. Take the tripe oat 
of tlie bag, put it into a jar, and pour over 
it the liquor in which it was boiled. When 
to be dressed, boil scHne whole small onions 
in a part of the Ik^uor, add a little salt, then 
put in the tripe and heat it thorooglily. 

Or it may be fried in buttor firicasseed, or 
stewed in a brown sauce. 

Instead of being boiled in a bag, the tripe 
may be put, with some 'salt and whole pep> 
per, into a stone-ware jar, which must have 
a piece of linen tied over it, and a plate hid 
upon the top. The pot should always be 
kept full of boiling water, taking care thrt 
it do not boil into the jar. - 

TRIPE, TO ROAST. Cot the tripi 
into two obfong pieces, make a feroemBii

f)f bread cnimfae and chopped parsley, eea- 
Booed with pepper and salt; bind it with 
die yolks of two eggs ; spresid it upon the 
lat side of the tripe, and lay on the otiier 
fiit side ; then roll it very tightly, and tie it 
with packthread. Roast, and baste it with 
butter: it will take one hour, or one hour 
and a half. Serve it with melted butter, 
into which put a table-spoonful of ketchup 
and one of lemou pickle. 

TRIPE, BREADED. Cut your tripe 
into small square pieces, and give them a 
few turns in some butter, .with parsley, salt, 
aod pepper; roll each bit in grated bread, 
and broil tliem slowly. When done, serve 
them with slices of lemon. 

TROUT. This 6sh is held in great 
estimation, it is a fresh water fish, and 
when good, of a flesh cobr, and the spots 
npon it are very bright ; the female is con« 
mdered the best, and is known by tlie head 
being smaller, and the body being deeper 
than that of the male* 

TROUT, POTTED. Mix together 
the following quantity of finely*powdered 
spices: — One ouow of cloves, half an ounce 
cSf Jamaica pepper, quarter of an ounce of 
black pepper, quarter of an ounce of cay- 
enne, two nutmegs, a little mace, and two 
tea-epoonfak of ginger; add tlie weight of 
the spices, and naif as much again of salt, 
and mix all tliorougbly. Clean the fish, and 
eat ofif the lieads, fins, and tails ; put a tea- 
qx>onful of the mixed spices into each fish, 
and lay them into a deep earthen jar, with 
the backs downwards; cover them with 
clarified butter, tie a paper over tlie mouth 
of the jar, and bake them slowly for eight 
hours. Wlien the back bone is tender, the 
'-fish are done enough. Take them out of 
the jar, and put them into a milkpan with 
the backs upwards; cover them with a 
board, and place upon it a heavy weisht. 
When perfectly cold, remove die fish into 
fresh jars, smooth tliem with a knife, and 
cover them with clarified butter. 

TROUT, TO COLLAR. Wash them 
clean, split them down the back bone, and 
t diy them well in a cloth ; season them well 
with finely-pounded black pepper, salt, and 
I nKice; roll them tight, and lay them close 
r into a dish ; pour over an equal quantity of 
i vineigar and heear, with two or three bay- 
t leaves, and some whole black pepper; tie 
i over the dish a sheet of buttered paper, and 
t bake them an hour. 

TROUT, TO BROIL. Cut off the fins, 
I aod cut the fish down the back, close to tlie 
t hooe, and split die head in two. Another 



way is, after they liave been cut open, to 
nib a little sail over them ; let them lie thi-ee 
or four hours, and llien Imng tliem up in the 
kitchen. Thev will be ready to broil the 
next morning for breakfiist. 

TROUT, TO BOIL. Clean and gut 
tiiem; make the water as salt as for boil- 
ing salmon in, and when it lioils put in the 
trout, and let them boil fiist from fifteen 
to twenty minutes, according to tlieir siae. 
Sauce; — melted Imtter. 

TROUT, TO FRY. Cut off the fins, 
clean and gut them ; dust them with flour, 
and dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten ; 
strew grated bread crumbs over, and fry them 
in fresh dripping; lay them upon tlie hack 
of a sieve before die fire to drain. Sauce; 
—melted butter, with a table-spoonful of 
ketchup, and one of lemon pickle in it. 
When iliey are small, roll them in oatmeal 
before tliey are fried. 

TRUFFLES. Tlie trufile, like the mush* 
room, is a species of fungus common in 
France and Italy ;«it generally grows about 
eight or ten inches bebw the surface of the 
ground ; as it imparts a most delicious flavor, 
it is much used in cookery. Being dug out 
of the earth, it requires a great deal of wash- 
inff and brushing, befoi-e it can be applied to 
culinary purposes ; when washed, the water 
should be warm , and changed frequently. It 
loses much of its flavor when dried. 

TRUFFLE SAUCE. Mince two «► 
three truffles very small, and toss them up 
ligtitly, in either oil or butter, according to 
your taste ; then put to them four or five la* 
dieilils of veloute and a.spoonflil of con- 
somme; let it lioil fer about a quarter 
of an hour over a gentle fire, skim off aU 
the fat; keep your sauce hot in tlie 6atn- 
marie, 

TRUFFLES TOURTE. Take two 
pounds of fine trufiles, wash and pick them ; 
put them iiiU) a stewpan, with six thin slices 
of ham, a very little carrot, a sliced miion, 
a bay-leaf, sweet herbs in powder, salt, and 
Champagne ; lay rashers of bacon over the 
wliole, and stew tliem to nearly a jelly. 
When cold, put the truffles into a crust with 
all the seasoning ; bake the tourte,, and serve 
as usual. 

TUNBRIDGE CAKES. Rub two 
ounces of butler into half a pound of dried 
flour; add a few caraway seeds, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar; mix 
it to a stiff paste with u little water, roll it 
' out very thin, cut it into round cakes widi 
a glass or the top of a dredging box» prick

TUNBRIDGE PUFFS. Put into a 
nicely-tinned nucepan a pint of milk, and 
when it boils, stir in as much flour aa will 
make it a thick batter; add three welU 
beaten e^s, and two or three drops of oil 
of cinnamon, or any other seasoning; dust 
a large flat plate with flour, with a spoon 
throw on it Uie batter, in the form of balls 
or fritters, and drop them into boiling cla- 
rified dripping or uird. Serve them with 
pounded loaf sugar strewed over. 

The batter may be made into a podding, 
adding with the '<^g8 an ounce of sak but- 
ter. Boil and serve it with a sweet sauce. 

TURBOT. Turbot, when good, shouM 
be thick and full, and the belly of a yellow- 
ish white or ci^eam color. 

TURBOT, BAKED. Wash vour fish 
ia several waters, dn* it well, and soak it 
in melted butter, with sweet herbs, parsley, 
pepper, salt, and nutme|; in half an horn* 
put the whoke into a barang dish, envelope 
It completely in bread crumbs, and bake it. 

TURBOT, BREADED. Prepare a 
small turbot as usual, slit it across the back, 
and soak it for an hour in melted butter, 
or lemon-juice, with parsley, sweet herbs, 
salt, and pepper. Cover the fish with 
bread crumbs, and broil it; when done, 
squeeze lemon, or Seville orange-juice over 
it, and serve. 

TURBOT, STUFFED AND BAKED. 
Your turbot being properly cleansed, turn 
over the skin of the under side, without cut- 
ting it off; make a/orce, with some butter, 
parsley, scallions, morels, sweet herbs, ail 
shred, and united together, with yolks of 
eggs, and seasoned with pepper and salt; 
spread this all over the under part of the 
lish, cover it with the skin, and sew it up. 
Dissolve some butter in a saucepan ; add to 
it when melted, the yolk of an egg, sweet 
herbs shred, salt, and pepper; rub the fish 
all over with this, then bread, and bake it. 

TURBOT, TO BOIL. (1) This excellent 
&k is in season tlie ^^reatest part of the sum- 
mer; when good, it is at once firm and ten- 
der, and abounds with rich .gelatinous nu- 
triment. 

Being drawo, and washed clean, if it be 
quite fresh, by nibbing it lightly with salt, 
and keeping it in a cold place, you may in 
moderate weather preserve it for a couple 
of days. 

, An hour or two before you dress it, soak 
It in spring water with some salt in it, tbea 



seore the skin across the thickest part of 
the back, to prevent its breakrag oa iIk 
breast, which will happen from die Mi 
swelling, and cracking the skin, if this prs- 
caution be not used. Put a kirge handfal 
of sak into a fish-kettle with cokl waler, 
lay your fish on a fish-strainer, put it ii^ 
and when it is coming to a boil, skim il 
well ; then set the kettle on the side of the 
fire, to boil as gently as possible for aboal 
fifleen or twenty minutes (if it boik ftot, 
the fish will break to pieces) ; supposing k 
a middling<«ized turbot, and to iveigh eight 
or nine pounds. 

Rub a little of the inside red coral spawn 
of the lobster dirongh a hair siex'e, wifln 
out butter; and whoi the turbot is dished, 
sprinkle the spawn over it. Garnish the 
dish with sprigs of curled parsley, sfioed 
lemon, and finely-ecraped honseradish. 

If you like to send it to table in full dresi^ 
surround it with nioely-fried smelts, gndjl- 
eons are often used for this purpose, Rnanaj 
be boueht very cheap when smelte are very 
dear; lay the largest opposite the broadest 
part of tne turbot, so that tliey may form a 
well-pmportioned fringe for it; or oysters; 
or cut a sole in strips, crossways, about the 
size of a smek ; fry them and lay them 
round. Send up lobster sauce, two boato 
of it, if it is for a large party. 

Oba. — The thickest part is the fiivon'te; 
and the carver of this fish most remember 
to ask bis friends if they are fia-fimciers. 
It will save a troublesome job to the carver 
if the cook, when the fish is boiled, cuts ths 
spine bone across the middle. 

TURBOT, TO BOIL. (2) Put into 
the torbot kettle, with the watn*, two isi|^ 
handfuls of salt, and a tea-cupfol of vint^ar; 
when it boils vexy fost, take off the scum; 

Eut in the turhot, and when it boils again

the di'ainer; when it is sufllcientfy done, 
dish and garnish it with a fringe or carted 
parsley and cut lemon. Sauces;— k^irter

Cold boiled turbot eats wdl with sihid 
sauce. 

Turbot is generally considered best per- 
fectly firesh ; but some people prefer it kepi 
for a few days, hung up by the tail ia a 
cool place. 

TURBOT, GRILLED. Split the M 
down the back, and soak it for suiaHiMt 
with mehed butter, parsl^, sweet herH 
salt, and pepper. Bread the tarbot w^

T URKEY, BOILED. Make a stuffing 
of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nutm^, lem- 
on-peel, a few oysters, or an anchovy, a bit 
of butter, some stiet, and an egg; put this) 
into the crop, ^ten up the skin, and boil 
the turkey in a floured cloth to make it very 
white. Have ready some oystef sauce 
made rich with butter, a little cream, and a 
qx>onful of soy, and serve over the turkey, 
or you may serve over it a liver and lemon 
aauce. 

TURKEY, TURKEY POULTS, and 
OTBEB Poultry. A fowl and a turkey 
require the same management at the fire, 
only the latter will take Lnger time. 

Many a Christmas dinner has been spoil- 
ed by the turkey having been hung up in a 
oold larder, and becoming thoroughly fro- 
aen ; Jack Frost has ruined the reputaticm 
of many a turkey roaster. 

Let them be carefully picked, &c. and 
break Uie breast bone (to make them look 
plump), twist up a sheet of clean writing 
paper, light it, and thoroughly singe the 
turkey aU over, tui-ning it about over the 
flaoie. 

Turkeys, fowls, and capons have a much 
better appearance, if, instead of trussing 
them with the legs close together, and the 
feet cut off, the Jegs are extended on each 
■ide of die bird, and the toes only cut off, 
with a skewer thi'oiigh each foot, to keep 
Aem at a proper distance. 

Be careful, when you draw it, to preserve 
ibe liver, and not to break the gall-bag, as 
DO washing will take off the bitter taste it 
gives, wh^ it once touches. 

Prepare a nice, clear, brisk fire fi>r it. 

Make stuffing; stuff it under the breast, 
where the craw was taken out, and make 
some into balls, and boil or firy them, and 
lay them round the dish ; they are handy to 
help, and you can then reserve some of the 
ioBide stumng to eat with the ookl tuikey, 
car to enrich a hash. 

TURKEY EN DAUBE. Tak^anoM 
tmkeyt tnm it in the usoal way; roU ■ome 



large lardona in a mixture of salt, pepper, 
four spices, and sweet herbs, and tlien latd 
the turkey with lliera ; lay slices of bacon 
in a braising-pan, put the turkey on them, 
witli two small knuckles of veal, the fept of 
the bird, four carrots, six (Hiions, three 
cloves, two bay-leaves, thyme, a bunch of 
parsl^, and young onions ; cover the whole 
with bacon ^nd a piece of butterejl paper; 
dilute it with four ladlefuls of stock (or 
more if the turkey be very large), put in a 
little salt, and set the pan on the fire to boil 
slowly for three hours and a half; then take 
it off, but do nut take the bird out fur at 
least half an hour. Strain off the liquor, 
and then reduce it to a fotirth, or more if 
very thin; break an egg into another sauce- 
pan, beat it up well, and then |X)ur the li- 
quor on ii, whisk them well together, and 
if it wants flavor, add a few sweet herfae, 
parsley leaves, and a young onion or two; 
put it on the fire, stirring it violently until 
ready to boil ; as soon as it has boiled up 
once or twice; set it by tlie side of a stove, 
put fire on the top of the saucepan, and let 
it simmer half an hour ; then strain it car^ 
fully through a fine cloth, and let it cool to 
serve it with the turkey. 

TURKEY, HASHED. (1) Out up the 
remains of a roasted turk^, pot it into a 
stewpan, with a glass of white wine, chop- 
ped parsley, shallots, mushrooms, truffles, 
salt and pepper, two spoonfuls of cultis^ and 
a little stock ; boil half an hour, and reduce 
to a thick sauce ; when ready, add a pound 
of ancliovy, and a squeeze of lemon ; skim 
off all the fat from the sauce, and serve aU 
together. 

TURKEY, HASHED. (2) Stir m 
piece of butter rolled in ftom* into some

turk^, but not too small; put it into the 
sauce, add grated lemon-peel, white pepper, 
pounded mace, a little mushroom ketohup or 
mushroom powder ; simmer it up, and serve. 
Oysters may be added. 

TURKEY, ROASTED. It may be 
either stoffed with sausage hieat, or stoffiog 
the enme as fen: fillet of veal. As this makes 
a large addition to the size of the bird, take 
care that the heat of the fire is constantly to 
that part, as it fiieqnently happens tliat the 
breast is not shfficiently done. A strip cf 
paper should be put on the bone to prevent 
its scorching, while the other parts are 
roasting. Bcusto well, and firoth it up. Serve 
with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a 
sauce tureon. A few bread crumba, and a 
beaten egg shonkl be added to the stoflbig

■tringy outside. Full-grown turnips will 
take about an hour and a half gentle boiling; 
if you slice them, which m:i8t people do, they 
will be done sooner; try them with a fork; 
wlien tender, take tliein up, and lay them on 
a' sieve till the water is thoroughly drained 
from them. Send them up whole; do not 
•lice tliem. 

TURNIPS, TO Boil Yellow or 
Large White. Wash, pare, and throw 
them into cold water; put them on in boiling 
water with a little salt, and boil them from 
two hours to two and a half, drain tliem in 
a cullender, put them into a saucepan, and 
mixing in a bit of butter, with a beater mash 
them very smoothly, add half a pint of milk, 
mix it well with the turnips, and make them 
quite hot befofe serving. If they aiie to be 
florved plain, dish them as soon as the water 
utdnmedoff. 

TURNIP TOPS, Are the shoots which 
grow out (in the spring) of the okl tm-nip 
roots. Put them mto cold water an hour 
before they are to be dressed; the more wa- 
ter they are boiled in, the better th^ will 
look ; if boiled in a small quantity <^ water 
they win taste bitter: when the water bnib, 
put in a anmll handful of salt, and then vour 
iregetables ; if fresh and young, they will be 
dme in about twenty mmutes; drain them 
on the back of a sieve. 

TURTLE SOUP. (1) To dre$8 a 
l\tfile weighing one hundred and twenijf 
pounde. Having cut off the head close to 
the shell, hang up the turtle till the next 
^y> then open it, bearing the knife heavi- 
ly on the bock of the aumal in cutting it 




off* all roond ; turn it on its end, tliat iA 
the blood and water nay run otit, then eat 
the flesh off along the spine, sloping the kn% 
towards the hones so as to avoid tourhiag 
the gall, and hnving also cut tlie flesli fnm 
the lege and ntlier memliers, wasli the vMk 
well and drain it. A lai^ ve^i^l of boi> 
ing water being ready on the fire, put m 
the breast shell, and when the plates w3 
separate easily take them out of the water; 
boil the back and belly in water till the softs 
parts can be taken off easily ; but before they 
are siifiiciently done, as they are to be again 
boiled in tlie sauce, lay them to cool ringH 
in earthen veitsels that they may not FtKX 
together, let the bones continue to stew he 
some time, as the liquor muift be used fir 
moistening tlie sauces. 

All the flesh cut from the body, the ibff 
legs and head must be stewed in the luHowing 
manner. Lay a few slices of ham (m the 
liottoiii of a lar^ stewpan, and over the han 
two or threb knuckles of veal, then aljove the 
veal, the inside flesh of the turtle, and that 
of the menibev^B over the whole, adding a 
large bunch of sweet herbs, such as sweet 
basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, a hand- 
ful of parsley, and green onions, and a 
onion stuck with six cbves. T'heo 
moisten it with the water in which the 
is Ixfilins, and wlien it has stewed some 
time, moisten it again with the /iqoor ia 
which the back and belly have been boiled. 
Wlien the legs are tender, take them out, 
drain, and put them aside to he afterwardi 
added to the sauce; and when the flesh ii 
completely done, drain it through a silk sieves 
and mix with the uiuce some very thin whils 
roux; then cut all the softer parts, now 
sufficiently cokl, into pieces about ao iadl 
square, add them to the sauce, and 1^ tfaem 
simmer gently till they can be easily pierced; 
skim it well. 

Next chop a small quantity of heibs, and 
boil them with a little sugar in lour boCtlei 
of I Madeira till reduced to two, then rub it 
through a tammy, mix it with the tortla 
sauce, and let it boil for a short time. Make 
some forcemeat balls as follows:— Cot off 
about a pound of meiU from the fleriiy part 
of a leff tiCyeeA free from sinews or &t, soak 
in milk about the same quantity of cranAi 
of bread; when quite soft, squeeae and pit 
it into a mortar, tiigether with the veal, a 
small Quantity of calrs udder, a little bottori 
the yolks of four hard4x>ifed ens, a fittll 
cayenne, sak and spices; pound the wboll 
very finely, then thicken the mixtnre will 
two whole e^^ and the yolk of a third, tkrot 
a bit ioto boiling water, and if not sofficies^ 
firm, add the yolk of another egg, and w 
variety some chopped parsley may be nun' 
widi half of the forcemeat. Let the wfab 
cool BO that it may be formed into baJlsaM

Ifte site </(lie yolk of an e|^, pcmA dmi in 
iMiling water, and add theai to the turtle. 
BefiNre senring, mix a little cayenne wittf 
liie juiee of two or three lemooB, and add it 
to the loop. It is conerally (Nneferable to 
prepwpe the soap the day before it is required 
lor use, and it will foe best heated in a water 
lieth, or flat vessel containing water, which 
is always kept very hot, but not allowed to 
t»il. By the same method, sauces, stews, 
and other made dishes may be kept hot. 

Wheo the 6ns of the turtle are to te served 
as a side di^, thev must be first parboiled, 
dien skinned, andf stewed in a little turtle 
iaoce, with some Port wine, and seasoned 
with cayenne, salt, and a little lemon-juice, 
and diickened with butter and flour. 

Fricandeaux and Blanquettes may also be 
oiade of the flesh of the turtle, in the same 
way as those of veal. 

TURTLE SOUP. (2) The day before 
you dress a turtle, chop the herbs, and make 
Che forcemeat; then, on the preceding eve- 
ning, suspend the turtle by die two hind fins 
with a cord; and put one round the neck, 
with a heavy weight attached to it to draw 
out the neck, that the head may be cut off 
with more ease ; let the turtle hsuig all night, 
in whicli time the Uood will be well drained 
from the body. Then, early in the morning, 
having your stoves, and plenty of hot water 
in readiness, take, the turtle, lay it on the 
table on its back, and with a strong pointed 
knifis cut all round the under shell, (which is 
ifae callipee) ; there are joints at each end, 
which must be carefully found, gently sepi- 
rating it from the caliipash (which is the 
upper shell) ; be careful tliat in cutting out 
the gut you do not break the gall. When 
the callipee and the caliipash are pei-fectly 
aeparated, take out that part of the gut that 
leads from the throat; tliat, with the three 
hearts, put into a basin of water by them- 
selves; the other interior part put away. 
Take the callipee, and cut off the meat 
which adheres to it in four quarters, laying 
it on a clean dish. Take twenty pounds of 
vead, chop it 'up, and set it in a lai^e pot, as 
directed for espcignole, putting in the flesh 
of the turtle at the same time, with all kinds 
«f turtle herbs, carrots, onions, one pound and 
a half of lean ham, pepper corns, salt, a little 
flpioe, and two bay l^ves, leaving it to stew 
till it takes the color of eapagnoUj put the 
fins (the skin being scalded off) and hearts in, 
half an hour before you fill it, with half wa- 
ter, and half beef stock ; then carefully skim 
it ; put in a bunch of parsley, and let it boil 
genvf , tike cotuomme. While the turtle is 
Btewing, carefiilly scald the head, the calli- 
pee, and all that is soft of the caliipash, at- 
tentively ofaeerving to take off the smallest 
pttrtide of skin that may remain; pot them 
20 



with the gut into a krge pot of water fobo3 
till tender; when so, take them out, and oat 
thein in squares, putting th&n in a basin by 
themselves till wanted for the aoup. The 
next thing is the thickmiing of tne soap, 
which must be prepared in the same manner 
as sauce towmee. The turtle being wdl 
done, take out the fins and hearts, and lay them 
on a dish ; tlie whole of the lk]aor must pass 
throtiffh a sieve into a lai^ pan; then, with 
a ladte, take off all the fat, put it into a ba- 
sin, then mix in the turtle liquor (a smaU 
quantity at a time) with the thickening made 
the same as tauce Ummee; but it does not 
require to, neither must it be, one twentieth 
part so thick ; set it over a brisk fire, and 
continue stirring till it boils; wh«i it has 
boiled two hours, being skimmed all the 
while, squeeze it through the tammy into 
another lai^ stewpan, put it on the fire, and 
stir it as before, till it boils; when it has 
boiled sently for one hour, put in the calli- 
pee and caliipash, with the gut, hearts, and 
some of the best of the meat and head, all 
cut in squares, with the forcemeat halls and 
herbs, which ^ou should have ready chopped 
and stewed in eapagnolej (the herbs are 
parsley, lemon thyme, marjdram, basil, sa- 
vory, and a few chopped mushrooms). It 
must be carefully attended to and skimmed, 
and one hour and a half before dinner, put in 
a buttle of Madeira wine, and nearly half a 
bottle of brandy, keeping it continually boil- 
ing gently, and skimming it; then take a 
basin, put a little cayenne pepper into it, 
with the juice of six lemons squeezed throu^ 
a sieve. When the dinner is wanted, skim 
the turtle, stir it well up, and put in a little 
salt, if necessary; then stir in the cayenne 
and lemon-juice, and ladle it into tlie tureen. 
This receipt will answer for a tortle between 
fifty and sixty poun(&.

VEAL. The names of the joints are as 
follows: Loin, best end — Loin, chump end 
— ^Fillet — Hind Knuckle— Fore knuckle — 
Neck, best end — Neck, scraff end — ^Bbde 
bone — ^Breast, best end — ^Brisket end. 

Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, 
white, and fat, and the leg bone small. The 
finest calves have the smallest kidney, and its 
being well covered with thick white fat, in- 
dicates good veal. The fillet of a cow catf 
is to be preferred, on account of the udder. 
The prime joints are the fillet, the loin, the 



VEAL 



230 



VSAL 



cbamp end of the loin, and the best end of 
the neck. To keep it, the same directions 
may be followed, which are given for keeping 
bief. 

When the fillet is to be roasted, it should 
be waslied, well dried, and the bone taken 
oat, and the space filled with a fine stuffing, 
part of which should be put under the flap, 
dien formed into a round and firmly- skew> 
ered. That the fire may be clean and strong, 
it should be made up sometime before nutting 
down the roast, which should at nrst be 
placed at some distance from it, and be fre- 
quently and well basted with butter. When 
about lialf roasted, a piece of white paper is 
tied over the fat; a little before serving, it 
is removed, the meat is then sprinkled with 
salt, dredged with flour, and well basted to 
firoth it. When dished, finely melted butter 
is poured over it, with which may or may 
not be mixed some lemon pickle or brown 
gravy* It is garnished with cut lemon. 

Veal is expected to come to table looking 
delicately clean ; and it is so easily discol- 
ored, that you must be careful to have clean 
water, a clean vessel, and constantly catch 
the scum as soon and as long as it rises. 
Send up bacon, fried sausages, or pickled 
pork, greens, and parsley and butter, and 
onion sauce. 

Veal requires particular care to roast it a 
nice brown. Let the fire be the same as for 
beef; a sound large fire for a large joint, and 
m' brisker for a smaller; put it at some dis- 
tance from the fife to soak thoroughly, and 
then draw it near to finish it brown. 

When first laid down, it is to be basted; 
baste it again occasionally. When the veal 
is on the dish, pour over it half a pint of 
melted butter: if you have a little brown 
gravy b^ you, add that to the butter. With 
those joints which are not 8tufi*ed, send up 
forcemeat in balls, or rolled into sausages, as 
samish to the dish, or fried potk sausages ; 
bacon and greens, are also always expected 
with boiled veal. 

Fillet of VetU, Of from twelve to sixteen 
pounds, will require from four to five hours 
mt a good fire; make some stuffing or force- 
meat, and put it in under the flap, that there 
may be some left to eat cold, or to season a 
hash ; brown it, and pour good melted buttw 
o?wp it. 

Garnish with thin slicea of lemon and 
cakes or balls of stuffing, or duck stuffing, or 
fried pork sausages, curry sauce, bacoa and 
greens, &c. 

A bit of the brown outside is a fiivorite 
widi the epicm% in roasts. The kidney, cut 
out, slioea, and broiled, is a high relish, 
which some bont vivanU are fond of. 

A JLoin, Is the best part o( the calf, and 
win take about three hours roasting. Pa- 
pw the kidney fiU, and the back: some 



oodu send it up on a tooat, uMA m mtm 
with the kidney and the &t <^ thb pu^ 
which is as delicate as any marrow. If 
there is more of it than you thiok will ha 
eaten with the veal, before joa roaat it est 
it out ; it will make an exoelloit auet pid> 
ding; take care to have your fire kag 
enough to brown the ends; saoK ac co ia 
paniments as above. 

A Shoulder,- From three hours to thnt 
hours and a half; stuff it with the fon» 
meat ordered for the fillet <^ veal, in the 
under side. 

Neck, beat end. Will take two houra; 
same accompaniments as fillet. The scrag 
part is best made into a pie, or broth. 

Breast, From an hour and a half to two 
hours. Let the caul remain till it is almoet 
done, then take it off to brown it ; baate^ 
flour, and froth it. 

This makes a savory relish for a luncbeoB 
or su[)per: or, instead of roasting, boil it 
enough ; put it in a cloth between two pew- 
ter dishes, with a weight on the upper 006, 
and let it remain so till cold; then pare 
and trim, egg, and crumb it, and broil, or 
warm it in a Dutch oven; serve with it 
capers, or wow wow sauce. Breast of 
mutton may be dressed the same way.

be about half an inch thick ; trim thera, and 
flatten them with a cleaver; you may, fry 
tliem in fresh butter, or good drippings ; when 
brown on one side, turn them and do the 
other ; if the fire is very fierce, tliey must 
diange sides oftener. The time they will 
take depends on the thickness of the cutlet 
and the heat of the fire ; half an inch thick 
will take about fifteen minutes. Make some 
gravy, fcyy putting the trimmings into a stew- 
pan with a little soft >vater, an onion, a roll 
of lemon-peel, a blade of mace, a sprig of 
tli^me and parsley, and a bay leaf; stew

minutes, then add the ^vy by degrees till 
it is all mixed, boil it for five minutes, 
and strain it throi^h a tamis sieve, and put 
it to the cutlets; you may add some brown- 
ing, mushroom, or walnut ketchup, or lemon 
pickle, &c. : Or, Cut the veal into pieces 
about aa big as a crowD-piece> beat them

and serve up. 

Ofrs.— If celery is not to be had, use n 
carrot instead or flavor it with celery seed. 

VEAL KNUCKLE, STEWED WITH 
RICE. As boiled knuckle of veal cold is 
not a very fevorite relish with tlie generality, 
cut off some steaks from it, wiiich you may 
draw as in the foregoing receipt, and leave 
the knuekle no larger than will be eaten tlie 
day it is dressed. Break the shank bone, 
wtuh it clean, and put it in a large stewpan 
with two quarts of waUer, an onion, two 
bkdes of mace, and a tea*«|)oooful of salt: 
set it on a quick fire ; wlien it boils, take 
off all the scum. Wash and pick a quarter 
of a pound of rice; put it into the stewpan 
with the meat, and let it stew very gently 
lor about two hours: put the meat, &c. in a 
deep dish, and the rice round it. Send up 
bacon with it, parsnips, or greens, and finely 
minced parsley and butter. 

VEAL, KNUCKLE, SOUP. A knuckle 
of veal f^ six pounds, weight, will make a 
kuve tureen of excellent soup, and is thus 
easily prepared: cot half a pound of baccn 
into slices about half an inch thick, lay it at 
the bottom of a soup-kettle, or deep stewpan, 
and on tliis place the knuckle of veal, having 
first chopped the bone in two or three places ; 
finmish it with two carrots, two turnips, a 
head of celery, two large onions, with two 
or thiiee cloves stuck in one of them, a dozen 
corns of black, and the game of Jamaica 
pepper, and a good bundle of lemon thyme, 
winter savory, and parsley. Just cover the 



meat widi oold water, and set iCo«ers^p&iE 
fire till it boils ; having skitmned it wdl, 
remove your soup-kettle to the side of tl» 
fire ; let ii stew very gently till h is v/am 
tender, t. e. about four hours ; then take Ml 
the bacon and veal, strain the soup, aad set 
it by in a cool place till you want it, whia 
you must take off the Ut trosa tlie sorftce of 
your lk)uor, and decant it (keeping back the 
settlings at the bottom) into a clean pan. 

If you like a thickened soitp* pet three ta* 
ble-spoonfuls of the fiit.voo have taken off thy 
soup into a small steivpan, and mix it with 
four table-spooiifitls of floiir^ pour a fcidiefiif 
of soup to it, and mix it with the rest by de* 
grecs, and boil it np till it is sroootli* 

Cut the meat and gristle of the knodtle 
and tlie bacon into mnuthfiib, and put tfaeas 
into the soup, and let them get waiin«

and Uiree ounces of ham very small ; pot it 
into a stewpon with an oimoe of butter roll- 
ed into flour, half a gill of cream ; half a 
ciU of veal stock ; a little grated nutmeg and 
femon-peel, some cayenne pepper and salt, a 
spoonfiji of essence of ham and lemon-juic;e, 
and stir it over the fire sometime, taking 
care it does not bum. 

VEAL AND HAM PIE. Take two 
pounds of veal cutlets, cirt them in middling- 
siied pieces, season with pepper imd a very 
little salt ; likewise ona- of raw or dressocl 
bam cut in slices, lay it alternately in tlic 
dieh, and put some forced or saiaage meat 
at the top, with some stewed button mush- 
rooms, and the yolks of three eggs boiled 
hard, and a gill of water ; then proceed as 
with rump-stpak pie. 

N. B. — ^The best end of a neck is the fine 
part for a pie, cut into chops, and the chine 
bcme taken away. 

VEAL PIE. (!) Cut a neck of veal into 
Mat steaks, season them well with white 
jitepiper, salt, mace, and grated nutmeg mix- 
ed; pack them ckisely into a dish, and put 
IB half a pint of white stock ; five hard-boil- 
ed yolks of cm may be added ; pot puff 
parte on the edge of toe dish, and cover with 
Iha same. Lambs' tails may be amde into a 
pie, with lamb chops seaaooed in the same 
njamifir as the above. 

VEAL PIE. (2) Cot into steaks a 
lain or hveati (rf" veal, season them highly

than half a pint of stock made with the 
bones, thickened with a bit of butter rolled 
in floor, and seasoned with a tea-epooofol 
of lemon pickle, and a table-spoonfiil of 
white wine ; make a paste of the fat of the 
loin, and an equal quantity of flour, rub it 
togetiier, and mix with it a little cold water, 
roll it out two or three times, line the sides 
of the dish, pot in the meat, and cover it. 

VEAL PIE, SOLID. Stew in veal 
stock, till it be perfectly tender and like a 
jeUy, a piece of a knuckle of veal, with the 
grblies adhering to it ; let it cool, and then 
pull tlie meat and gristles into small bits; 
butter a pie dish or shape, and lay at r^lar 
distances some hard-boiled yolks of eggs, 
and some of die white part cut into rmgt 
or Bti'ips; tlien put over some bits of the 
meat and gristle, ' and strew over it scmie 
pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg mixed, and 
a little of the gravy, and then more ^gs, 
with small bits of beet root, green pickies» 
and the red part of a carrot cut to fiucy; 
add more meal seasoning, and all the gravy ; 
wlien the sliape is full, pot it into an ovee 
for twenty minutes, and when quite cold 
turn it out. If rightly done, it will have a 
glazed appearance, and the variety of cd* 
ors look well by candle light. 

VEAL, POTTED. Cut slices off a W 
of veal, and season then widi pepper, poumC* 
ed mace, cloves, and salt. Lay thin slicet 
of fro^ hqtter between each layw of meat 
into a potting pan or jar; cover it cloedlyy 
and bake it with bread. When it iis cold, 
pound tlie meat in a marble mortar, pack it 
closely into a jar, and poor clarified butter 
over It. 

VEAL, COLD, AN EXCELLENT 
RAGOUT. Either a neck, bin, or fillet of 
veal, will fumisli this excellent ragout with 
a very little expense or trouble. 

Cut the veal into liandsome cutlets ; pot 
a pieoe of butter or clean dripfMng into a 
frying-pan ; as soon as it is hot, mor and 
fry the veal of a light brown: take it out, 
and if you have no gravy ready, make some 
as directed under sauces, or put a pint of 
boiling water into tlie frying-pan, |rive it a 
boil up for a minute, and strain it into a 
basin while you make some thickening is 
the following manner: put about an ounce

ketchup or wine ; atrain it throush a tamis 
to the meat, and ttew very genUy till the 
meat is tboroiifffaly warmed. If you have 
any ready-boiled bacon, cut it in slices, and 
put it in u> warm with the meat. 

VEAL ROLL. Bone a small breast of 
veal, and spread over it a rich and highly- 
eeasoned forcemeat. Cut four hard-boiled 
eggs the long way into four pieces, and lay 
them in rows, with green pickles between 
each row. Roll up the veal tightly, and 
tew it ; then put it into a cloth, and bind it 
with tape. Lay a slice of ham over it, and 
put it into a saucepan, tc^etber with eome 
strong stock, and a little whole pepper, and 
ntew It for three hours. Make a rich gra- 
vy, and boil it up with a little white wine 
and lemon-juice or lemon-pickle; pour it 
over the veal ; add some egg and forcemeat 
balls, and garnish with cut green pickles. 
Thi j dish is very good when cold. 

y£AL SAUSAGES. Take equal quan- 
tities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful 
of sage, and a few anchovies. Beat all in 
a mortar, and season well with pepper and 
Mlt ; when wanted for use, roll and fry it, 
and B&me either with fried sippets, or on 
■tewed vegetables, w white collops. 

VEAL SEMELLES. Cut part of a 
fillet of veal into slices an inch thick, season 
them with salt and pepper, and give them a 
few turns in a little butlei:, with a bay leaf. 
Lay at the bottom of a deep saucepan a very 
thin slice of bacon, and on it one o( the 
alioes of veal, and continue to lay them in 
alternately^ until the whole are used, then 
add a glass of water and some bay leaves ; 
close Uie saucepan very tight, first putting 
a slieet of pap^ over the meat ; stew it on 
hot ashes for four or five hoars; take care 
fo keep the fire up to the same point aJl the 
time. 

VEAL STOCK. Cut a leg of veal and 
some lean ham into pieces, put them into 
a saucepan, with a quart of water, some 
carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celeiy ; 
stew them down till nearly done, but do not 
let it color ; then add a sufficient quantity 
of beef stock to cover the ingi'edients, and 
let it boil for an hour; skim off all the fat, 
and strain it ; a little game slewed down 
with the above will greatly improve the fla- 
yor ; be particularly careful that it does not 
bum. 

VEAL SWEETBREADS ROASTED. 
Trim off tiie tough part, and blanch for diree 



minoleB in a stewpan of water, widi a lit 
salt, three heart sweetbreads, then takedieai

some bread crumbs over, (ben sprinkle clari- 
fied butter over, and then bread crumbs 
again ; put them down to roast again for a 
quarter of an hoar, tiien take them off ths 
skewo*, and serve them on a dish over a littb 
butter sauce, mixed with a spocmfiil of gravy, 
a small bit of glaze, and a squeeze of lemoa- 
jiiice; let it oe hot, but not boiling, and 
thorouglily well mixed before it is served 
under the sweetbreads. 

VEGETABLES. There is nothing ia 
which the diflerance between an elegant and 
an ordinary table is more seen than in ths 
dressing of vegetables, more especially greens. 
They may be equally as fine at first, at one 
place as at another; but their look and 
taste are afterward very difierenl., entirdj 
from the careless way in which they have 
been cooked. 

Tliey are in greatest perfectJon when in 
greatest plenty, t. e. when in fiiU season. 

By season, I do not mean those earty days, 
diat luxury in the buyers, and avarice in the 
sellers, force the vegetables; bat that time 
of die year in whrch by nature 'tend oommon 
culture, and the mere operation of the son 
and climate, they are in most plenty and 
perfection. 

As to the quality of vegetables, the middls 
size are preferred to the mrgest or the smafl- 
est; tliey are more tender, juicy, and fbO 
of flavor, just before tliev are quite fiiU-growa. 
Freshness is their chief value and excellence, 
and I should as soon think of roasting an 
animal alive, as of boiling a v^fetabie after 
it is dead. 

The eye easily discovov if th^ have been 
kept too long; they soon hot their beauty ia 
all respects. 

Roots, greens, salads, &e.> and the varioos 
productions of (be garden, when firrt gather- 
ed, are plump and firm, wad have a firagrant 
freshness no att can give them again, wlien 
they have lost it by k>ng keeping ; though it 
will refresh them a little to put them inte 
cokl ^ring water for sometime before they 
are dressed. 

To boil them in soft water wiH presene 
the color best of such as are green ; if }-<m 
have only hard water, pat to it a tea-spoon- 
ful of cmrbonate ofpotMh. 

Take care to wash and cleanse tlwfl 
thorou^ly from dust, dirt, and insects: (hii 
re(|nire8 great attention. Pick off alt (hs 
outside leaves, trim them nicely, and, if Mt 
quite fi-e«h gatheied and have become flacdd.

it w absolutely iwoeBnry to restore tbeir 

crispness before cooking theoii or they will 
be tough and on pleasant: lav them in a pan 
of clean water, with a handful of salt in it, 
fcr an liour before yon dress tliem. 

They should always be boiled in a sauce- 
pan by themselves, and have plenty of water ; 
if meat is boiled with them in the same pot, 
tfa^ will spoil tlie look and taste of each other. 

If you wish to have vegetables delicately 
clean, put on your pot, make it boil, put a 
little salt in it, and skim it perfectly clean 
before you put in the greens, &c. ; which 
diould not be [Mit in till the water boils brisk- 
ly: the quicker they boil, the greener they 
will be. When the vegetiibles sink, they are 
generally done enough, if the water has oeen 
kept constantly boiling. Take tiiem up im- 
mediately, or they will lose their color and 
goodness. Drain tlie water from them 
thoroughly before you send them to table. 

This branch of cookery requires the most 
vi^lant attention. 

If vegetables are a minute or two too long 
over the fire, they lose all tlieir beauty and 
flavor. 

If not thoroughly boiled tender, tliey are 
tremendously indigestible, and much more 
troublesome during their residence in the 
^omach, than under-done meats. 

Once for all, take care your vegetables 
are fresh : for as die fishmonger often suffers 
for the sins of die cook, so the cook often 
ge& undeservedly blamed instead of the 
green -grocer. 

Strong-scented vegetables should be kept 
apart; leeks, or celery, laid among cauli- 
flowers, &cc. will quickly spoil tliem. 

Succulent vegetables are best preserved in 
a cool, shady, and damp place. 

Potatoes, turnips, carrots, and similar 
roots, intended to ue stored up, should never 
be cleaned from the earth adhering to them, 
tin tliey are to be dressed. 

Tbey must be protected from the action 
of the air and frost, by laying them in heaps, 
borying them in sand or earth, &c., or cov- 
ering them with straw or mats. 

When vegetables are quite fresh gathered, 
they will not require so much boiling, by at 
least a third of the time, as when they have 
been gathered the usual time of those that 
are brought to public markets. 

Vegetables are always best when newly 
gathered, and should be brought in from the 
garden early in tlie morning ; they will then 
have a fragrant fresliness, which they lose by 
i^eeping. 

They must be cleaned with the greatest 
care, tlie outside leaves of every description 
of greens removed, and they, and all otlier 
vegetables, more particularly when not re- 
cently gathered, slioukl be kid for several 
liouFB 10 cold water, and well shakeo to 



throw out tbe imecta. A tea^poonful af 
salt should alwaj-s be put into tbe water in 
which tliey are to be boiled, and if it is hard, 
a tea-spoonful of salt of tartar, or potash, 
may be added to preserve the green oobr of 
the vegetables. 

All vegetables should be boiled quickly, 
and, with tlie exception of spinach, in ao 
open vessel, skimming tliem carefully. 

Kitchen greens should be kept in a cool 
and shady puce. Potatoes, carrots, turnips, 
and beet root sliouki be stored up, without 
being cleaned fi*om the eartii adhering to 
them, in layers of sand, or laid in heaps, and 
covered with earth and straw. Parsnips and 
skirrets not being injured by frost, are gen- 
erally leA in tlie ground, and taken up aa 
wanted. Onions are stored in a warm, dry 
place, never in a cellar; diey are sometimes 
strung in bunches, and suspended from the 
roof, and, more effectually to prevent their 
growing, some people select the finest bulbsy 
and singe the roots with a hot iron. 

Herbs of all sorts sliould be gathered when 
in flower, and on a dry day, and bein^ well 
cleaned from dust and dirt, tliey are tied up 
in small bunches, and dried before the Are in 
a Dutch oven. They may then be kept in 
paper bags labelled ; or rubbed to a powder, 
sifted, and put into bottles. 

VEGETABLE ESSENCES. The fla- 
vor of the various sweet and savory herbs 
may be obtained by combining their essen- 
tial oils with rectined spirit of wine, in the 
proportion of one drachm of the former to 
two ounces of the latter, or by picking the 
leaves, and laying them for a couple of 
hours in a warm place to dry, and then filk

VEGETABLE MARROW, Is fit for 
use when about the size of a turkey's eg^^ 
AAer being waslied clean, it is put on m 
boiling water, with a little salt, and when 
tender, it is drained from tlie water, cut into 
half, and served on toasted bread, over 
which some melted butter has been poured. 
Or, after being boiled in milk and wafio'^ 
tliey may be fricasseed as Jerusalem arti-^ 
chokes, or stewed like cucumbers. 

VEGETABLES STEW. Pick and 
wash very clean as much spinach as will 
make a dish ; mince finely three small on^

VELOUTE. Take the cutting! and re- 
inains of any joints of veal and fowl yoo 
nay have in the house, of which take four 
pounds, and put into a large stewpan, with 
«oiue carrots, onions, parsley, scallions, 
three bay-leaves, three cloves, and « ladle- 
iul of stock; put your stewpan on b fierce 
£re, skim it well, and take care that the 
meal does not stidi; when sufficiently re- 
^luced, add as much stock as will nearly fill 
the stewpan, salt it well; give it a boil, 
«kim it, and then put it on the side <^ the 
fire to simmer for two hours; after wliich 
atrain it through a tammy. Make a white 
roux, stir into it for ten minutes a few 
champignons, then pour on it, a little at a 
time, tte above liquor; let it boil up once, 
«kim it, and set it again by tlie side of die 
fire for an hour and a half: take off all the 
fill, strain it again, and then put it by for 
use. Take care that the veloute is not in 
the least colored, as, the whiter it is the 
Jbetter. 

VENISON. The choice of venison 
should be regulated tw the appearance of 
the &t, which, when the venison is young, 
looks thick, clear, and ckise ; ais it oegins 
to change first towards the haunciies, run a 
knife into that part; if tainted you will 
perceive a rank smell, and it wiu have a 
green or blackish appearance. 

If you wish to preserve it, you may by 
carefiil management and watching, keep it 
for a fortnight by the following method: wash 
it well with milk and water very clean, and 
dry it perfectly with cloths until there is not 
the least damp remaining, then dust pound- 
ed ginger over every part ; this is a good 
preventive afainst the fiy. Wh&a to be 
dressed, warn it with a little lukewarm 
water, and dry it. Pepper should also be 
added to keep it. 

VENISON COLLOPS. These are 
dressed in the same manner as mince col- 
hips of beef, only that, in fdaoe of the sea- 
«Niing of the coUope of beef, they have a 
little pepper, salt, aisd some Port wine. 

VENISON, HASHED. (1) If you have 
enough of its own gravy left, it is preferable 
to any to warm it up m: if not, take some 
of the mutton gravy, or the bones and trim- 
nings o( the joint (after you have cut off all 
die handsome slices you can to make the 
hash) ; put these into some water, and stew 
them gently for an hour ; then put some but- 
ter into a stewpan ; when melted, put to it 
ap much floor as will dry up the butter, and 
<» it well together; add tP it by^^pnae^ 



the gravy yon have been inakin|r of die triui- 
mings, and some red currant jelty ; give it a 
boil up; diim it; strain it throush a sieve, 
md it IB ready to receive the venison: put it 
in, and let it just get warm: if you let it 
boil, it will make the meat hard. 

VENISON, HASHED. (2) Warm it 
in its own gravy ; if there is no lat left, take 
some slices of mutton fet, set it on the fire 
with a little Port wine and ragar, and let it 
sinuner till diy ; then add it to the hash. 

VENISON, HASHED. (3) Take some 

anchovies, boil them till they are dissolved, 
then add some oysters with their liquor, a 
little milk, some red wine, and a little ketch- 
up; put in your venison, let it warm in this, 
but do not let it boil, and serve it with fried 
sippets, and the sauce &c. over it. 

VENISON, MOCK. Hang up, for 
several days, a large fet loin of mutton ; then 
bone it, and take off all tlie kidney fat, and 
the skin from the upper fiit; mix together 
two ounces of brown sugar, and one ounce 
of ground black pepper. Rub it well into 
the mutton ; pour over it two or three wine- 
glasses of Port wine; keep it covered with 
the skin ; rub and tmn it daily for five days. 
When to be roasted, cover it with the skin, 
and paper it the same way as venison is 
done. Serve it with made gravy, and the 
same sauces as for venison. 

VENISON PASTY. (1) Oit a neck or 
breast into small steaks, rub them over with 
a seasoning of sweet herbs, grated nutmeg, 
pepper, and salt; frv them slightly in butter; 
line the sides and e3ees of a dish with puff 
paste, lay in the steaks, and add half a pint 
of rich gravy made with the trimmings of 
the venison ; add a glass of Port wine, and 
the juice of half a lemon, or tea-cpoonful of 
vinegar; cover the dish with pufiT paste, and 
bake it nearly two hours ; some more gravy 
may be poured into the pie before sorving it. 

VENISON PASTY. (2) Take a neck, 
shoukler, or breast of venison, that has not 
hung too lon^ ; bone them, trim off all the 
skin, and cut it into pieces two inches square, 
and put them into a stewpan, with three 
gills of Port wine, two onions, or a few 
eschalots sliced; some pef^ier, salt, dunes 
blades of mace, about a dozen all^ice, and 
enough veal broth to cover it ; put it over a 
sk)w fire, and let it stew till three parts done; 
put the trimmings into another saucepan, 
cover it with water, and s^ it on a fife. 
Take out tlie pieces you intend for theptutr, 
and put tliem into a deep dish with a liltli 
of their liquor, and set it fay to cool; tlM 
add the remainder of the lk|iior lo the boM

Mad trifluniiigs, and \»ii it till the pasty is 
ready ; then cover the pasty witli paste, orna- 
ment the t<^, and bake it for two houiis in a 
alow oven; and before it is sent to table, 
pour in a sauce made with the gravy the 
veuison was stewed in, strained and skimmed 
free from (at; some pepper, salt, half a giii 
of Port, the juice of half a lemon, and a little 
flour and butter to thicken it. 

VENISON PIE OR PASTY. All 
kinds of meat intended for pies and pasties 
mtist be hisfaly spiced when served hot, and 
still more hignly spiced when served cold ; 
but the seasoning must be regulated by judg- 
ment and taste. Take one or two breasts 
of venison, (according to tlie size yoti wish 
to make your pie or pasty), bone it thorough- 
ly, beat it verv flat, and lard it tbrougli and 
through with larduns, well seasoned with all 
sorts of spices, and sweet herbs finely chop- 
ped ; Hill it up as tight as possible, and tie 
It up with strong twine. Put into a stewpan 
the bones and trimmings of the venison, with 
carrots, onions, parsley, one clove of garlic, 
tiiyme, bay-leaf, pepper-corns, and allspice, 
and let all stew till nearly dry ; fill it up with 
equal quantities of beef or mutton braise, and 
water, which let boil very gently till done, 
then put in the roll of venison ; put paper on 
the top, cover very close, and let it stew 
gently with fire over and under. When 
sufficiently done, take it off the fire, and let 
it stand in the liquor until nearly cold ; ,then 
prepare a plain paste of four pounds of flour to 
one pound of Uitter, the same as for raised 
pie, but instead of making it stiff, mix it as 
soft as possible; lay part of tliis paste as 
thick as you well can round the edge of the 
dish; cut off the twine from tlie venison, 
skin, and lay it in the dish, and pour some 
of the gravy it has stewed in ; put on the 
cover, trim it very neatly, make a hole in 
the top, do it over with egg, and bake it in 
a moderate oven for three or four hours; 
reduce the remainder of the liquor it was 
stewed in, and when the pie is baked, pour 
it in ; serve it cold. The pasty can scarcely 
be made too diiok. 

VERMICELLI, QUEEN'S. Blanch 
about a quarter of a pound of vermicelli in 
boiling water, drain it, and throw it into 
some rich well-seasoned stock; when tender, 
take it out of the soup, and put it into the 
tureen; thicken the soup with eight well- 
beaten eggs, mixed with half a pint of cream, 
and pour it, when quite hot, upon the ver- 
micelli. 

VERMICELLI IN MILK. Boil the 
^pianti^ of milk you may require, and put 
into it half a pound of vermicelli peeled, and 
a sufficient quantity of sugar ; stir it frequent- 



ly that the vemioelli may not ibfw a pntm 
half an hour will be long enough to>boil it. 
A little almond milk may be added when 
ready for table#' 

VERMICELLI PUDDING. (1) Boil 
a quarter of a pound of vermicelli with a 
liuie cinnamon, in a quart of milk; in the 
meantime mix a (|uarter of a pound of melt- 
ed butler with a pint of cream, and the yolks 
of four eggs; pour in the venmcelli when 
quite soft ; add a littte flour and beef mar- 
row, and powder sugar to tlie taste; beat all 
up for half an hour, tie it in a floured ckith, 
and boil it. 

VERMICELLI PUDDING, (2) Boil 
four ounces of vermicelli in a pint o( new 
milk, until quite tender, with a stick or two 
of cinnamon. Then add lialf a pint of thkk, 
cream, a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
quarter of a pound of sugar, find the yolks 
of four eggs, thoroughly beaten; lay the 
above in a dish and bake. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. Take as much 
good stoek as you require for your Uireen, 
strain, and set it on die fire, and when it 
boils, put in the va'iuicelli, and let it simmer 
for half an hour by a sk>w fire, that the ver- 
micelli may not Ijurst ; the soup ought not to 
be verv thick. Half a pound is sufficient 
for eight or ten persons. 

VINEGAR. This is an acid liquor, pre- 
pared by a second fermentation from various 
liquors, such as wine, cider, perrv, bear, 
mead*, skimmed milk, &c. But the most 
common method of making it, in England, 
is from malt, and the process is as follows:— 
infuse a quantity of malt in hot water for an 
hour and a half, then pour it into a cooler. 
As soon as the infusion is sufficioitl^ cold, 
put it into deep tuns, add yeast to it, mid 
leave it to ferment for four or five days ; after 
which put the liquor into barrels, in a room 
heated with stoves, so that a moderate warmth 
may be kept up for six weeks, and the fer- 
mentation continue regularly. By the end 
of that time the whote will be completely 
soured, and must now be changed into other 
badrrels ; lay a tile on the Imng-holes to keep 
out the wet, but not so close as to prevent a 
fiiee circulation of air, and then place them 
in the open air for four or five months, ac- 
cording as the weather is warm or otherwise ; 
during the whole of this period, the fermenta* 
tion proceeds, and at the end, the vinegar is 
nearly done. The next operation is this : the 
vinegar is poured into ]ai|;e vessels, called 
rapetuns, to which there are folse bottoms cov- 
ered with rape, that is, the refiise of raisins, 
or other firuit, firom which wine has beeo 
Boade; fill one of these tuns entire^ with 



VIN 



!240 



VI!^ 



tl» mnenr, and another about three-fiNVtln 
foil, and every day take a portion of the 
liqiior ouCof the fuUest barrel, and put it into 
the other, until the vinegar is in a fit state to 
be drawn off; wlien it must be closely bar- 
lellod* 

Vinegar may also be made in much smaller 
quantities for domestic purposes ; the mate- 
rials uf various kinds, with tlie addition of 
sugar; raisins, currants, and ripe goose- 
berries, however, are the principal; some- 
times it is made from brown sugar, and wa- 
ter alone. The proportions are the same as 
thtise necessary for sbnong wine; make the 
barrel about three-fourlhs full, add a toast 
covered sy'iih yeast, put in the bon^ very 
loosely, and place the barrel where it will 
be exposed to the sun, or, if it be winter, 
near the fire. Tlie fermentation should be 
moderate and constant till the vinegar is 
complete ; then draw it off clear, give it a 
boil, and when quite cold, strain and bottle 
it. 

Vinegar is obtained from wine, by mixing 
with tlie latter its own flowers, or ferment, 
and its tartar reduced to powder, and put 
into a vinegar or any other cask; if the 
latter, it must be placed in a warm situation, 
full of the steam from vinegar; in either case 
the liquor should be stirred frequently; the 
eeoond fermentation will speedily commence; 
it will become heated, and turn acid by de- 
grees, and in a short time the vinegar will 
be produced. 

It is commonly supposed that wine which 
has become acid, will produce excellent vin- 
egar ; tliis, however, is a mistaken idea, for 
the stronger and better the quality of the 
wine, the stronger and better will be the 
vinegar. 

The French have several melliods of mak- 
ing vine^r, which are subjoined. 

The vmegar makers of Orleans pour the 
wine, of which they intend to make tlieir 
▼inc^r, into casks, at tlie bottoms of which 
are close grating of lime twigs; these serve 
to clarify the wine, as the lees adhering to 
the twigs, leave the liquor perfectly clear. 
They- then procure a niunber of casks, each 
containing a hundred gallons, either new or 
which have previously contained vinegar; 
these are set upright, and in the top of every 
one is bored a hole, two inches in diameter, 
these are kept constantly open: the last men- 
tioned casks are called Mothers; pour into 
all of them twenty-five gallons of boiling 
▼in^ar; to this, in a week's time, add 
three gallons of wine, drawn fi-om the first 
mentioned casks; continue to add the wine, 
at intervals of a week, until the Mothers 
are quite full ; then leave them for a fortnight, 
and at the end of which period they generally 
draw off the vinegar, taking care always to 
Iqave the Mothers half fJl, at least, and 



then to fill them with wine aa before. He 
method of proving when the vinegar is fit fir 
use, is, by plungmg a stave into it; if ott 
taking it out, a white line iff peroepcibie oo 
the end of it, tlie vinegar is auite readhr. 
'file place where the casks are kept aiioald 
be very airy, and in the winter tinoe, by 
means of stoves' the temperature should be 
raised to eighteen degrees of Reaumar. 

Paris vinegar varies from the abuve, and 
the process is veiy simple. A large quanti^ 
of wine lees is put into coarse sacks, and 
laid in tuljs, which are placed one npon an- 
other to form a kind of press ;. by means of 
a screw, every drop of wine is gradually 
sqiteezed from the lees; this operation cannot 
be performed in less time than a week. Tlie 
wine thus extracted is put into casks; in 
the headings a hole is made, as above, which 
holes are feft constantly open; in sommer 
time the casks so filled are placed in tlie sun, 
and, generally speaking, the vine^r is fit 
for use in a fortnight. In the winter, the 
fei*mentation will last double the time, and 
must be assisted by artificial warmth. It 
sometimes happens that the liquor heats to 
so great a degree that the hand cannot be 
borne in it; in this case, the progress of 
the fermentation must be checked by adding 
more wine, until it proceeds more regulariy. 
When the vinegar is made, put it into casks, 
which have the beech twigs at the botlom, 
as above mentioned ; let it 'remain a fort- 
night, by which time it will be sufficiently 
fermented to draw off into the casks for 
keeping it. 

Another very simple inetbod is also prao- 
ti:.ed in France; a few quarts are drawn 
from a barrel of excellent vinegar, and aa 
equal quantity of very clear wnite wine is 
put into the barrel, close the bang lightly, 
and keep it in a place where the heat is 
moderate and regular. In a month's time 
draw off tlie same quantity as above, and 
pour in an equal portion of white wine. A 
barrel qf good vin^;ar will thus afibrd a 
constant supply for a length of time witboot 
leaving the slightest deposit. 

A cask which has not contained yinenr 
before, should have a quart <^ boiliog not 
vinegar poured into it, shaken till cold, and 
allowed to stand for some hours. 

VINEGAR, BASIL. Sweet basil k m 
full perfection about the middle of Ausoal. 
Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with the rah 
green leaves of basil (these give much finor 
and more flavor than the dried,) and oofver 
them with vinegar, or wine, and let them 
steep for ten days: if yoo wish a very atroqg 
essence, strain the liquor, put it on aooe 
fresh leaves, and let them stoqi fourteen daji 
more.

VINEGAR, AMERICAN. Boil six 

£ lions of water, and add, while it is hot, 
nr quarts of molasses ; put it into a tub to 
cool; when milk warm, stir in a pint of 
firesli yeast; put it into the cask, and set it 
by tUe 6re for twenty-fuur hours ; then put 
it in the sun, with a bottle in the bung-hole. 
Bottle it three months aftei'wards. 

VINEGAR, BURNET OR CUCUM- 
BER. This is made in precisely the same 
manner as directed almve. The flavor of 
bumet resembles cucumber so exactly, that 
when infused in vinegar, the nicest pahite 
would pi-onounce it to be cucumber. This 
is a very favorite relish with cold meat, sal- 
ads, &c 

VINEGAR, CAMP. Cayenne pepper, 
one drachm, avoirdupois Mreigbt. Soy, two 
table-«poonfuis. Walnut ketchup, four d itto. 
Six anchovies chopped. A smaii clove of

va a pint of the best vin^ar, frequently shak- 
ing the bottle: strain through a tamis, and 
keep it m small bottles, corlusd as tightly as 
possible. 

VINEGAR, CHILI. This is commonly 
made with the foreign bird pej^r ; but you 
v^ll obtain a much finer fevor from infusing 
fifty fresh red English Chilies (cut in half, or 
pounded) in a pint of tbe Ijest vinegar for a

them, and let them inflise for a fortnWlit; 
then strain it through a flannel bag, and put 
it into small bottk». By the same means, 
vinegar may be flavored with the fi«sb gath-

VINEGAR, GARLIC. Cut ^mall one 
ounce and a half of garlic, bruise one nutnwff 
and three cbves, kteeo them in a <^art of 
vinej^ for a we^, ahaking it daily; then 
strain and bottle it. Shallot vin^ar is made 
in the same manner. 

VINEGAR, GOOSEBERRY. Gadier 
yellow goosebm-ies wlien quite ripe, crush 
and mash them well in a tub with a lai^ 
wooden pestle; to eveiy two gallons of 
gooseberries, after being mashed, put two of 
water; mix them well together; let it work 
for three weeks, stirring the mass two or 
three times each day; then strain the liquor 
through a hair sieve, and put to every gallon 
one pound of brown sugar, one pound of 
treacle, and a table-spoonful of fresh yeast ; 
let it work for three or four days in the same 
tub, which has been well washed ; then run 
it into iron-hooped casks. Let it stand 
twelve months, and bottle it for use. This 
is a very strong vinegar. 

VINEGAR, HONEY. Half a pound 
of honey must be put to a pint of wa- 
ter, and the honey well dissolved. This 
mixture is then exposed to tlie greatest heat 
of the sun, without cloBing wholly the bung- 
hole of the cask, which must be merely cover- 
ed with coarse linen, to prevent the admission 
of insects. In alK>ut six weeks, the liquor 
becomes acid, and changes to a very strong 
vinegar, and of excellent quality. 

VINEGAR, HORSERADISH. Horse- 
radish is in highest perfection about Novem- 
ber. Pour a quart of best vinegar on three 
ounces of scraped horseradish, an ounce of 
minced eschalot, and one drachm of cay- 
enne ; let it stand a week, and you will have 
an excellent relish for cold beef, salads, &c. 
coeting scarcely any thing. A portion of 
black pepper and mustard, celery or cress- 
seed, may be added to the above. 

VINEGAR, RASPBERRY. The best 
way to make this, is to pour three pints of 
tbe best white wine vinegar on a pint and a 
half of fresh-gathered red raspberries in a 
stone jar, or china bowl (neither glazed 
earthenware, nor any metallic vessel, must 
be used ; ) the next day strain the liquor over 
a like quantity of fresh raspberries; and tha 
day following do the same. Then drain off

VIXEGAIl FOR SALADS. Take of 
tarragnn, Kivory, chives, eschalots, thi-ee 
ounces each ; a handful of the tops of raidt 
and lialm, all dry and pounded; put into a 
wi<)e-mouthe(l bottle, with a gallon of best

VOL-AU-VENT. (1) Cut some coW 
turkey or veal into small thin slices, season 
it with dried lemon-peel grated, pepper, 
pounded mace, stnd salt ; add one anchovy, 
some garlic and onion pounded, also a little 
good gravy, a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, 
one of white wine, and an ounce of butter 
rolled in flour ; then make it quite hot, but 
do not alk>w it to boil, and seiTe it in tlie 
prepared vol-au-vent. The gravy may be 
made with the bones, or a little cream, and 
the beaten yolk of an egg may be substituted 
for tlie cream. 



VOL-AU-VENT. (2) In opening the 
oysters, separate them from the liquor, which 
must be strained ; take off the beards, and 
add to them the liquor, togetlier with some 
white stock, a bit of butter rolled in flour, 
two or three blades of mace, a bit of lemon- 
peel, pepper, and salt ; simmer them for fifteen 
or twenty minutes, and a little before putting 
them into tiie vol-au*vent, pick out the lenKMi- 
|)eel, add atable^spoonfulof white wine, and 
three of good cream, and make it quite hot. 
To make oyster patties, when they are to be 
bearded, cut them into three or four bits, 
aud prepare them in the same manner. 

VOL-AU-VENT. (8) Roll off tart paste, 
tiU about the eighth of an inch thick: then, 
with a tin cutter made for that purpose 
(about the- size of the bottom of the aish you 
intend sending to table,) cot out the shape, 
and lay it on a baking-plate with paper; 
rub it over with yolk of vgg; roll out good 
puff paste an inch thick, stamp it with die

WAFERS. Take a pint of good cream, 
half a pound of sifted flour, half a pound of 
powder sugar, and two drachms of orange- 
flower water. Beat the ci^eam with the 
flour, a little at a time, until both are mixed 
perfclctly smooth and free from lumiis, thea 
add the other articles; and as much vaon 
cream as will make the paste nearly as thin 
as milk ; make the iron hot, dip a feadier in 
some melted butter, and mb the iron over 
with it; put on die iron about a spoonfid 
and a half of the paste, press them a little 
gently, and place the iron on a stove; open 
the iron a little frequently, to see if it be 
done ; when one side is baked, Uim the iron, 
and do the other. The wafers shookl only 
be lightly colored. Take them from tn 
mould carefully with a knife. 



WAFERS, GERMAN. Take 
teen ounces of sifted flour, and half a pint of 
good yeast, which make into a paste, wilk 
as much warm milk as will make it nm iiroB 
the spoon fineely, without being too clear; 
then put it into a warm place. When it fan 
risen well, add to it the yolks <^ fburteei

The whole being well mixed, poor over k 
seventeen ounces of fresh boUer melted, liit

taken off very eently, and the spoon laid 
across the top of the vessel ; if these precau- 
tions be not att^Mled to, the good appear-

WAFERS, ITALIAN. Take eight 
eggs, fourteen ounces of powder sugar, a 
pound of fiour, six ounces of cream, the same 
of milk, an ounce of orange flowers, and the 
rind of a lemon grated. Beat the eggs with 
the sugar and flour first; then add the cream, 
milk, and other materrals, by degrees; mix 
them well, and take care there are not the 
slightest lumps. Make the walors as di- 
rected. 

WALNUTS. Make a brine of salt and 
water, in the proportion of a quarter of a 
pound of salt to a quart of water ; put tlie 
walnuts into this to soak for a week ; or if 
yon wish to soften them so that tliey may 
be soon ready for eating, run a lardii^ 
pin through them in half a dozen places — 
this will allow the pickle to penetrate, and 
they will be much softer, and of better fla- 
Yor, and i-eady much sooner than if not per- 
forated : put them into a stewpan with such 
brine, and give them a gentle simmer ; put 
tfaem on a sieve to drain ; then lay tliem on 
a fish plate, and let thehi stand in the air till 
diey turn black — ^this may take a couple of 
6ay9 ; put them into glass, or unglazed stone 
jars; fill these about tliree parts witli the 
walnuts, and fill them up with the following 
pickle. 

To each quart of the strongest vinegar put 
two ounces of Mack pq>per, one of ginger, 
same of eschalots, same of salt, half an ounce 
of allspice, and half a drachm of cayenne. 
Put these into a stone jar; cover it with a 
bladder, wetted with pickle, tie over that 
some leather, and set the jar on a trivet by 
the side of the fire for three days, shaking it 
up three times a day, and then pour it while 
hot to the walnuts, and cover them down with 
bladder wetted with the pickle, leather, &c. 

WALNUTS AND BUTTERNUTS. 
Gather them for pickHng when the head of 
a pin will pierce them easily ; run a large 
needle diroii^h them here and there, or score 
tbem on one side with a knife; jay them 
into a brine of salt-and-water for twelve 
days, changing the brine twice in that time; 
strain, and put them into a jar, and sprinkle 
a little salt over tbem. Boil lour qinrts of 



Vioegar for a hundred walaatti, alkiwing 1» 
each quart one oanoe of whoks- pepper, aad 
one of ginger, half an ounce each of sliced 
nntooeg and whole allspice, a table-spoiMifid 
of mustard seed, and one of scraped horis- 
radish, one head of garlk, or a small oniod; 
pour it boiling hot over the nuts, and pot a 
plate on the jar; when cold, tie it dbeeif 
down. After tlie nuts are used, the liquor 
may be boiled, strained, and bottled, to uts 
as a pickle. 

WALNUT KETCHUP. (1) Thorougb- 
ly well bruise one hundred and twenty young 
walnuts; put. to them three quarters of a 
pound of salt, and a quart of good wine via* 
egar; stir them every day for a fortnight; 
tlien strain and sqwseze the liquor from them 
through a cloth, and set it aside ; put to tlid 
husks half a pint of vinegar, and let it stand 
all night; then strain and squeeze them as 
before, adding the liquor which is obtained 
from tliem to what was put aside the preced- 
ing day, and add to it one ounce and a 
quarter of whole black pepper, forty cloves, 
half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, or sliced, 
half an ounce of ginger, and five drachms c€ 
mace, and boil it for half an hour; diea 
strain it off'from the spices, and bottle it for 
use. 

WALNUT KETCHUP. (2) Take six 
lialf-sieves of green walnut-shells, put them 
into a tub, mix them up well with coinm<Mi 
salt, (from two to three pounds,) let them 
stand for six days, frequently beating and 
mashing them; by this time the shells be- 
come soft and pulpy ; then by banking it up 
on one side of the tub, and at the same time 
by raising tlie tub on that side, the liquor 
will drain cUsav off to the other; then taka 
chat liquor out: tlie mashing and banking* 
up may be repeated as often as liquor is 
found. The quantity will be about six 
quarts. Wlien done, let it be simmered ia 
an iron boiler as long as any scum arises ; 
then bruise a quarter of a pound of ginger, a 
quarter of a pound of allspice, two ounces of 
long pepper, two ounces of cloves, with the 
above ingredients ; let it slowly boil for half 
an hour; when bottled, let an equal quantity 
(^ the spice go into each bottle; when cork- 
ed, let the bottles be filled quite up: cork 
them tight, ^eal them over, /md put them 
into a cool and dry place for one year beforo 
they are used. 

WALNUT KETCHUP, FOR FISH 
SAUCE. Take a quart of walnut pickle, 
add to it a quarter of a pound of anchovies 
and three-quarters of a pint of red Port, aad 
kt it boil till reduced to one-third; tbaa 
strain it, and when cold, pot it into 
bottles, and keep them closely corked.

WALNUT PICXLE. Ptttanyqauiti- 
f? of the outside sheHi or grMh rinds of 
npe waioots into a tub id which there is m 
tap-hole; sprinkle them with water, raise 
the tub on one side, diat it may stand in a 
ilopii^ direction, phioe another vessel under 
it to receive the jeioe as it drops from the 
tap-hole; this it will soon bi^in to do; and, 
when a sufficient auantity has been obtained, 
to one gallon of this Mack liquor add two 
large table-spoonfiibpf salt, one terge «Miioo, 
a stick of horseradish, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two bay leaves, a quarts <^ an ounce 
of black pepper, the same of allspice and (^ 
braised ginger. Boil it sbwiy for twentj^ 
minutes; strain it, and, when cok), stir it 
and bottfe it for use, puttii^ the spice into 
thebottksB. 

WALNUl'S, TO PICKLE. Gather 
the nuts before the inside shell is hard, whidi 
may be known by trying them with a pin; 
ky Uiem into salt and water nine aays, 
clianging the liquor eveir three days; then 
take them out, and dry liiem in the air on a 
sieve or mat; they should not touch each 
crther, and they should be turned, that every 
side may become black alike; tlieti put 
them into a jar. When half the nuts are 
in, put in an onion, with about thirty cloves 
stuck into it. and add the rest of the nuts. 
To one hundred walnuts allow half a pint 
of mustard seed, a quarter Of an ounce of 
mace, half an ounce of peppercorns, and 
sixty bay leaves ; boil all the spice in some 
good common vin^ar, and pour it boiling 
upon tlie nuts, observing that they are en- 
tirely covered ; stop the mouth of the jar 
with a clotli, and when cold, cover it with 
bladder or leather. In about six weeks 
they will be fit lor use, when they slionid lie 
examined, and if they have ausorbed the 
vinegar so mudi as to leave any of the nuts 
dry, more should be added, but it need not 
be boiled. 

WATER SOUCHY. Make a stock 
with three or four flounders, boiled in three 
quarts of water, two onions, and a bunch of 
parsley, till they are soft enough to pulp 
through a sieve with the li(]Uor they were 
boiled in ; tlien season it with pepper, salt, 
and soite parsley chopped, and boil in it a 
few floundered with tlie brown skin tak«i 
off, some nicely cleaned perch or tench. 
Swve in a tureen, and with slices of bread 
and butter to eat with it« 

WELSH RABBIT. Pare the crust off 
a slice of bread, toast it nicely, divide it in 
two, butter it, ajod lay upon each half a thin 
slice of cheese which has been toasted in a 
Dutch oven; if, when put upon the toast, it'

Mir it over the ire till smooth, then serve. 

WHITINGS, FRIED. (1) Take as many 
whiting as yoa may require; cleanse, scale, 
and wipe them dry ; then run them through 
the eyes with a skewer, soak than well m 
milk ; floiv, and fry them of a nice cobr. 
Serve them on a napkin.

preserve the liver, and fasten their tails to 
their mouths; dip them in egg, then in 
bread-crumbs, and fry them in hot lard, or 
split them, and fry ttuem like Allets of soles. 
A three<qoart stewpsm, half full of fat, is the 
best utensil to fry whitings. They will be 
done eoou^ in about five minutes; but it 
will sometimes require a quarter of an hour, 
to drain the fat from them and dry th^n (if 
the fiit you put them into was not hot enough),

WHITE FISH AND SAUCE. Make 
a rich gravy with a bit of veal, the heads and 
fins of four or five haddocks, three or four 
onions, some parsley, a little cayenne, black 
pepper and salt, tlie juice of a lemon, half 
the peel, a taUe-spoonfiil of ketchup, half a

■imnier them for an hour, strain, and pot to 
it the meat of a lobster or crab minced, and 
forcemeat balls; thicken it with half a pint 
of cream, the yolks of three eggs b«iten, and 
a pint of butter kneaded iu flour. Have 
ready boiled three haddocks skinned and 
witBout their heads, pour the saooe over 
them in a deep dish. Make the forcemeat 
balls of a small boiled haddock finefy minc- 
ed, grated bread crumbs, butt»r, pepper,

with the whites or two eggs beiten, and fry 
them in fresh lard of a light brown. 

WHITE POT. Beat up the yolks of 
eight, and the whites of four eggs, with two 
quarts of new milk, a little rose water, a 
antmeg, grated, and a qoartor of a pound

WHITE SAUCE. See BeehameL 

WIDGEONS AND TEAL, Aiedraesed 
exactly as the wild duck; only that less time 
is reouisite for a widgeon, and still lev for 
a teal. 

WILD DUCKS. For njasting a wiU 
duck, you must have a dear, brisk fire, and 
a hot spit ; it must be browned upon the out- 
side, without being sodden within. To have 
it well frothed and full of ^vy is the nicety. 
Prepare tlie fire Iw rtimng and raking it 
just befcMie the bird is laid down, and fifteen 
or twenty minutes will do it in the fashion- 
able wav; but if you Uke it a little more 
d(Hie, allow it a few minutes longer ; if it is 
too much, it will lose its flavor. 

WINE (MADEIRA) SAUCE. Take a 
tea-spoonful of fk)ur, and a preserved green 
lemon, cut into dice, mix them with a glass 
of Madeira wine, and a little consommef 
add an ounce of butter, some salt and nut- 
meg ; set tliese on a very hot stove to boil 
for a quarter of an hour ; then take it off, 
put in a quarter of 'a pound of butter, set it 
again on the fire, stirring constantly till the 
butter is melted. 

WINTER HOTCH4>OTCH. Take 
the best end oi a neck or loin of mutton } 
cut it into neat chops ; cut four carrots, and 
as many turnips into slices; put on four 
quarts of water, with half the carrots and 
turnips, and a whole one of each, with a ' 
pound of dried green peas, which must be 
put to soak the mght before ; let it boil two 
hours, then take out the whole carrot and 
turnip; bnyse and return them; put in the 
meat, and the rest of tlie carrot and turnip, 
scMne pepper and salt, and boil sfowly three- 
quarteiv of an hour; a diort time before 
serving, add an onion cut small and a head 
ofoeltfy, 

WOODCOCKS. (1) The greatest 
possible care should be taken, in picking of 
these birds, to handle them as little as poe* 
sible, on account of the skin being so par- 
ticularly tender, that when broken it spoilt 
the beautv of the bird. When picked, cut 
off the pinions at the first joint, press the 
legsckise to the side, through which, and 
the body, pierce the beak of the bii-d; then 
cross toe Jeet, and lay a slice of bacon over 
the breast. Woodcocks and snipes may be 
dressed aooording to the same rufes. 

WOODCOCKS. (2) Take a poui^ 
of lean beef, cut it into pieces, and put it 



IVOO

yfiA 



into a nnoepan, with two quarts of water, 
an (Miion stuck with cbves, two blades of 
mace, and some whole pepper, boil all these 
toeisther till reduced to half; then strain it 
off into another saucefmn: draw the wood- 
cocks, and lay the trail in a plate ; put the 
woodcocks into the gravy, and let them boil 
in it for twelve minutes; while they are 
boiling, mince the trail and liver very small ; 
put them into a small saucepan, with a lit- 
tle mace; addft)ur or five spoonfuki of the 
gravy the woodcocks are boiled in ; then 
take the crumb of a stale roll, rub it fine 
into a dish placed before the fire, and put to 
the trait, in the small saucepan, half a pint 
of red port, a bit of butter, rolled in flour, 
set it on the fire, and shake it round till the 
butter is melted; then put in the bread- 
crumbs, and shake the saucepan round ; lay 
the woodcocks in tlie dish, pour the sauce 
ever them, and serve. 

WOODCOCKS. (3) Woodcocks should 
not be drawn, as the trail is by the lovers 
of " haul gout" considered a " bonne 
bouchei" truss their legs close to the body, 
and run an iron skewer through each thigh, 
close to the body, and tie them on a small 
bird spit; put them to roast at a clear fire; 
cut as many slices of bread as you have 
birds, toast or fry them a delicate brown, 
and lay them in tne dripping-pah uud^r the 
birds to catch the trail; baste them with 
butter, and froth them with flour ; lay the 
toast on a hot dish, and the birds on the 
toast ; pour some good beef gravy into the 
dish, and send some up in a boat, twenty or 
thirty minutes will roast them. Garnish 
with slices of lemon. Some epicures like 
this bird very much under-done, and direct 
that a woodcock should be just introduceO 
to the cook, for her to show it the fire, and 
then send it up to table. 

WOODCOCKS IN A MINUTE. Put 

a brace of woodcocks into a fryingpan, 
with some butler, shred shallots, grated, 
nutmeg, salt, and pepper; set the pan on a 
fiei'ce fire, and fry the woodcocks lightly for 
seven or eight minutes ; then add the juice 
of two lemons, half a glass of while wine, 
and some raspings ; and leave them on the 
fire till tlie sauce has boiled ^p once; then 
serve altogether. 

WOODCOCK SALMIS. Out up the 
woodcock, on the table, and put the pieces 
on a dish, which place on a stand, widi a 
lamp under it ; add pepper, salt, shred shal- 
lots, nearly a glass of white wine, the juice 
of three lemons, and a bit of butter; strew 
raspings over, anci boil slowly for ten min- 
utes, stirring occasionally. Use spirits of 
wine for your lamp. 



WOODCOCK SAUCE. Pound ^ 
bones and livers of roasted woodeocka, aad 
put them into a stewpaa, with two spoaa- 
fiiis of cuUis, and two i^joonfuls of ned port; 
reduce it to the consistence of a sauce, vti 
then strain it ; wh«a strained, add pepper, 
salt, and the juice of two oranges. 



Y. 



YEAST. Beer yeast, which is the best 
for bread, slxmld be strained through a hair 
sieve, and two or three quarts of cold spring 
water poured over it; when it has stood for 
twenty-four hours the water should be poianl 
ofi*, the yeast will then be fixindat thebotfeom 
of the vessel, quite tliick. To preserve that 
which may be left over the baking, it ^Kmld 
be put into a bottle, corked tigbtfy, and kept 
in a cool place. In cold weathn- it wiU 
continue good for a fortnight, but fiiesh yeaat 
is always preferable. When it does not ap- 
pear sufficiently strong, honey or brown sug^ 
may be mixed with it, in the proportioiiCtt a 
tea-spoonful to half a pint. 

YEAST, BAKER'S. Boil two oonoee 
of hops in four quarts of water one boor, 
adding more water as it decreases, carefiilly 
stiiTing it all the time, and takii^ care that 
it do not boil over; strain the liquor, and 
mix well with it two pounds of malt; cover 
it, and let it stand for eight hours, or until it 
be milk warm, then stir in half a pint of 
good yeast; when mixed well ti^ether, let 
It work for ten hours, and then strain it 
through a hair sieve. 

YEAST, BRAN. Boil for ten minotes, 
in two quarts of water, one pint of bran, and 
a small handful of good hops; strain it 
through a sieve, and when milk warm, add 
three or four table-spoonfiils of beer yeast, 
and two of brown sugar or treacle: pot it 
into a wooden stoup w jug; cover it, and 
place it before the fire to ferment. It may 
be bottled, tightly corked, and kept in a com 
place. , 

YEAST DUMPLINGS. Make a vert 
light dough with yeast, the same as for breao, 
but with milk instead of water, add salt; 
set it by the fire, covered up in a pan, for 
half an hour, or an honr, to rise ; in the mean 
iiii:e, set on the fire a large saucepan of hot 
water, and as soon as it boils, roll up the 
dough into small balls, and put them into the 
boiling water; keep them o(Mitinually boiling 
for ten minutes, dien take them out, and 8er?8 
them immediately, with wine sauce over 
them. To ascertain whether they are "

^__ Jtly boiled, stick a fork into one, and if it 
cones out clean, it is done enough. Some 
think the best manner of eating them is by 
dividing them from the top by two forks, as 
they lieoome^ heavy bv their own steam, and 
eat tbem immediately widi meat, or sugar 
and butter, or salt. 

YELLOW GLAZE. Make a glase, 
with a quarter of a pound of fine sugar in 
powder, tlie white of an eg^, to which add 
by degrees as much lemon-juioe as may be 
necessary; when sufficiently beaten up, (and 
the longer it is beaten the whiter it will be), 
add to it a small quantity of infusion of saf- 
fron, strained, and the yellow rind of one or 
two lemons grated on a piece of sugar, scrap- 
ed off and' pounded; take care, however, 
not to put too much of the latter, lest the 
glaze should be hitter. 

YEAST, TO MAKE. Boil for half an 
hour two quarts of water, thickened with 
about three spoonfuls of fine Hour, and 
sweetened with nearly half a pound of brown 
sugar ; when almost cold, put it into a jug, 
addii^ four spoonfuls of fresh yeast ; shake 
it weU together, let it stand uncovered near 
the fire for a day, to ferment. There will be 



a tfam lK|nor on the top, poor this off; shake 
the remainder, and cork it op for use. To 
make a half peck loaf yon should use a quur* 
ter of a pint of the above. 

YEAST, POTATO. Boil some good 
mealv potatoes ; peel and weip[h them ; while 
hot, bruise them nnely, and mix than quickly 
with boilinff vrater, albwinff one quart to 
each pound ; rub it throuj^ a hair sieve, 
then add honey or brown sugar in the pro- 
portion of one ounce to each quart of water ; 
noil it to the consistency of batter, wad when 
nearly coM, add a large table^poonfol of 
good yeast lo every quart of water; cover it 
with a cloth to rise, and the following day it 
will be ready for use; keq) a bottle of it, 
which may lie used instead of beer yeast for 
the next making, first pouring off the thin 
liquid that is on tb^ top. It must be made 
with fresh beer yeast every two or tluree 
months. Double the quantity of this, as of 
beer yeast, is required to imke bread 
light. 

ZESTS. Zest (a term of art, used by 
confectioners) is the peel of oranges, lemons, 
or citrons, cut from top to bottom, in mall 
slips or xests, as thin as poBsibie.

6ake litem in a cool oven. 

ALMOND BUTTER. To a auarter 
of a pound of blanched almonds, weU beat, 
pat some new milk and rose water ; take 
a quart of thick cream, and the yolks of 
twelve eggs beat well with a littte of the 
cream ; then add the rest of the cream ; put 
a quarter of a pint of new milk to the al- 
monds, and stram them into the cream till 
there is do strengtli left ; sti^in all togeth- 
er into a skillet, set it over a -charcoal fire, 
and stir it till it comes to a tender curd ; 
put it into a strainer, and hang it up till the 
whey is drained out; then take six ounces 
of fine sifted sugar and a little rose water, 
and beat it all into butter with a spoon. 

ALMOND BITTER CAKE. Pound 
diree ounces (half bitter and half sweet) of 
abnonds, put them into an eartlien pan with 
six ounces of powder sugar; the same of 
■ifted fiour, two whole eggs, and six yolks, 
a spoonfiil of brandy and a grain or two of 
■alt ; work these up together for five min- 
utes and then add six ounces of fresh but- 
ter which is slightly warmed, work that in 
for four minutes longer. Then, having 
whipped the whites of two ^gs, mix them 
Into the paste. Butter a well-tinDed^eopper 



ALM 

mould or paper case, ten inches long, five 
wide, and two high ; pour in your prepara- 
tion, and bake it in a cool oven. While bak- 
ing, whip tlie whites of two e^, and mix 
two ounces of powder sugar with them, and 
cut four ounces of sweet almonds into slips 
(shortwise ; ) mix tliem also with two ounces 
of powder sugar and a spoonful of white of 
egg whipped. In three-quarters of an hour 
take out the cake, and if it be firm and well 
colored, cover it with the whipped egg and 
sugar, and on tliat strew the almonds equal- 
ly, pressing them in, that all may be colored 
alike. This operation must be performed as 
quick as post^.ble, and when done, turn the 
cake out and cut it in four slips (length- 
wise,) and then divide each into six parts 
lozenge-shaped ; this will give you twenty- 
four cakes, which must be ari'anged in stars 
on your dish, six to every star. ThOT 
may also be cut in two lengths instead of 
four, and these divided into fifteen small 
pieces, and then, with a paste-cutter, form- 
ed into ci^escents. The ingredients, and the 
proper quantities for this cake are as follows: 
— SIX ounces of flour, the same of powder 
sugar, three ounces of sweet and bitter al- 
monds, six yolks, and two whole e^, six 
ounces of butter, two of sugar mixed with 
the whites of two eges whipped, four ounces 
of cut almonds added to the sugar and eggs, 
a spoonful of brandy and a grain of salt, 

ALMOND CANDY. Blanch a pound 
of the best almonds, and cut tliem very 
thin, lengthways, put them into a pound of 
clarified sugar to crisp them, stir them over 
the fire till boiled to ioujffle; dien take 
them off and keep stirring till the sugar is 
dry like sand: then sift it, so that the al- 
monds may be lefl, divide them into four 
parts to cobr them differently, one part 
red, the second yellow, the third green, and 
the fourth left white as they come from the 
sugar. To color the first, soak a small 
mntity of carmine in clarified sugar, and 
Ky your almonds in it ; do the same with a 
little tincture of saffron for the yellow, and 
spinach juice for the ^reen. Place the col- 
ored almonds on a sieve in a stove; wheo 
dry, muE all together, adding the while

Boil nearly «§ muoh fogmr at yo«r 
■KNiid will require to towffUt pot it io, and 
when the almonds are quite dry, garnish the 
■urfiioe of the sufgar with tfalem; do not, 
however, lay them too tiiick, and just press 
them down with a fork ; put the mould in- 
to a moderate oven for five hours, tlien drain 
it well, and in another two hours it may be 
taken firom the mould. 

ALMONDS aNNAMON-SPANISH. 

Blanch your almonds, then with a bit of 
butter tied in a piece of cloUi, rub the pan 
and brown them. Have ready some clari- 
fied sngar, with powdered cinnamon stirred 
in it, put in the ulmonds, and when well cov- 
ered with the sugar and cinnamon, lay tliem 
separately on tins, and diy in a slow oven. 

ALMONDS TO COLOR. Almonds 
ROSE COLORED. Blanch and cut sweet 
almonds in small pieces, put them on a bak- 
ing plate, and pour on them a little of any 
Tegetable liquia, of an infusion of cochineal, 
or carmine ; then rub them in your hands, 
to mix them well with tiie color; when all 
are so done, dry them in a stove or in the 
oven. 

ALMONDS VIOLET. Are done in the 
same way, the coloring ingredients are 
cochineal, and a little indigo dissolved in 
water, put but a small quantity of die latter 
at a time as it is very powerful^ 

ALMONDS GREEN. The same pro- 
ceeding: the color is made with two hand- 
fuls of fresh spinach, well washed, drained, 
and then pounded; when very fine, press it 
• through a napkin ; let the juice drop on a 
dish, which place on a hot stove ; as soon as 
it begins to boil, take it off, stirring it con- 
stantly, till the green curdles, then pour it 
through a horsehair sieve, and when well 
drained strain it through a silk sieve or tam- 
my ; the juice tlius obtained, will give the 
almonds (which must be put in a tew at a 
time) a clear and even green color. 

ALMONDS BLUE. Dissolve a little in- 
digo in water, strain it through a cloth and 
use it as above mentioned. 

ALM9NDS ORANGE COLORED. 

Mix a titde liquid red, and a little infusion 
of saffron together, and proceed with.the al- 
monds as usual. 

ALMONDS LEMON COLORED. 

Infiise a small quantity of sa(&on in nearly 
boiling water for a few minutes'; strain and 
follow the above direction. 

ALMONDS CHOCOLATE COLOR. 



ED. Are dyed with cfaoeohte dianlfid m 
water and strained. 

The aJmonde may be cot in dipe, dioe» 
&c. according to wej. Observe that the 
color of your almoida should be light and 
delicate; when done, plaoe (hem, eitiier 
separately or mixed together, in paper 
cases. 

ALMOND COUPEAUX. Blanch and 
pound half a pound of sweet almonds with 
die whites of three eggs into a very fiae 
paste, add to it six ounces of powdered aii- 
gar and tiie rind of a lemon grated; ¥dien 
thoroughly mixed together, pour over it 
about lour spoonfuls of orange-flower water: 
stii up tiie paste (which on^t to be rather ' 
thin,) once more, and then lay it with a 
spoon on a plate of bright copper, in an 
oval form, about three or four inches io 
length. The plate being quite fidl, take it 
up by lioth hands, and strike it steadily upon 
a table, so that the paste may be extended, 
but not much ; then bake tbem until ih^ be- 
come of a deep yellow. Take them firom 
the copper with a knife, and whilst liot pot 
them on a wooden roller, about the thick- 
ness of an arm, and press them with your 
hand, that tliey may acquire the form of the 
wood, and when cool place in a box, and 
keep tbem diy. These coupeaux are veiy 
brittle. 

ALMONDS CRISPED. Rnbaponnd 
of the best sweet almonds in a cloth to take 
off all die dust, and then put them, with 
a pound of sugar, lialf a glass of water and 
a little carmine, into a preserving pan; put 
them on the fire, and let Uiem remain; when 
the almonds crackle take them ofl[ and work 
them about until the sugar is detached fixim 
the almonds, then take away part of the su- 
gar, put the almonds on tiie fire again, and 
stir them lightly with a spatula, (be carefid 
that tiie fire be not too quick;) and whea 
tliey have taken the sugar, add that which 
had been removed, and continue to bum 
them till diey have imbibed that also. Place 
a sheet of papei* on a sieve, throw your alt 
monds on it, sepai'ate those which adhere 
together, and let them cool. 

ALMOND DRAGEES. Take of the 
best and largest almonds what quantity yoa 
please, and having washed them in cold war 
ter, let them dmin and dry <mi a sieve fiic 
twenty-four hours. Tlie n«Lt day weigh 
them, and for each pound of almonds take 
three pounds of sugar ; clarify the latt^ and 
boil it to the degree petit line; then let it 
cool a little. Have your tossing pan reaify; 
on your right hand, a cliafing diisli to kem 
your pan containing the sirup constaotnr 
warm ; and on your led hand, a table witk' 



ALU

ALM 



a nxture of powder and flour (of each half 
a pound to a pound of almonds). All bein? 
Rady, put the almonds into the pan, ana 
pour o^'er them one or two large spoonfuls 
of the sirup, and ^ake them so that all the 
almonds may be wetted with sirup; then 
take « handful or two of the flour and pow- 
der, and strew it ova* the wet almonds; 
ekake them again, that the flour may adhere 
all round tiie almonds. After this, swing 
the pan backwards and frirwards, by which | 
meana. the almonds roll about in every direc- 
tion; coiHinue this motion until thev become 
dry ; ilien moisten and powder them as be- 
fyre; swing the pan a^in, and when dry, 
repeat the process a Uiird, fourth, and fifth 
time, or roone, until they are of a proper 
size; then pour over them the sirup for the 
last time, without the powder, and, having 
ewung and dried lliem, take them out and 
place tliem on sieves in a warm place, that 
they may dry perfectly before you put them 
by for use. 

Observe, that afler a few layers of the 
sirup, tlie superabundant parts of that and 
the powder form a white crust at the bottom 
of the pan; as soon as it acquires any de- 
gree of thickness, the pan must be taken 
from the fire, the almomls carefully removed 
with an iron spatula, and the crust broken 
off; when the pan lias been well waslied and 
dried, replace the almonds and proceed with 
yoor worle. This must be strictly attended 
to, not only with this, but in making all 
kinds (^sweetmeats. The sugar thus clear, 
ed away may be made useful for many pur- 
poses* 

Comiixtn Almond Dragees are made in 
the same manner; the only difference con- 
sists in having ingredients of an inferior 
iqpiaiity. 

ALMONDS (MILK OF) FANCHON- 
NETTES. Blanch and pound eight ounces 
o€ sweet and one of bitter almonds, and

ring it constant^. Line about thirty tartlet 
moulds with thin puff paste, and put on them 
a little of the above preparation, and bake 
tiiem in a moiderate ov^. When properly 
done, take them out and let them oool. Mix 
'with the whites of three hard eggs, four 
oonoes of powder-sugar, stir it well to soften 
the egg, and make it work easily; put some 
of toe remainder of your preparation on 
each of the fanehormetteBy and cover them 
lightly with the egg ; put isoine white of egg 



on the bMe of a large knife, and whh a 
small one as quick as possible take off sev- 
en meringuea about the size of a filbert, 
and arrange them in the form of a crown on 
each fanckonnette; when you have done 
five or six, cover diem with powder-sugar 
very equally^ and then bake them in a cool 
oven. When of a reddish brown they are 
done and may be served. 

ALMOND CHEESE, BITTER. Peel, 

wash, and drain, three ounces of sweet, and 
one ounce of bitter almonds, pound them to

water. Put them into an earthen pan, with 
two glasses of nearly boiling milk, in which 
eight ounces of sugar have been dissolved ; 
let this stand an hour, Uien strain it through 
a fine sieve, and put to it six drachms of 
isinglass lukewarm ; place the whole in ice 
and when ii begins to set, add some whipped

two or three eggs, some powdered cinnamon 
and a little flour, knead them into a paste, 
and roll them into the form of sausages with 
your hand on the table, first strewing the 
table with almonds qainced, but not very fine ; 
so that they may adhere to the sausages, 
which ought to be aix)ut the size of yoor 
finger ; then form them into rings or gar- 
lands of what size you please, fixing the ends 
together with water : place them on paper, 
and bake them in a quick oven until they are 
of a clear brown color.

of a ■poonfiil of the almond ghie, ao«t with 
the blade of a knife spread it equally over 
the surface for about die eigbth of an inch, 
and tlien let tliein stand for half an huur 
before you put them into the oven, which 
mi«t \ie moderate. If you bake them imme- 
diately aAer putting on die^laze, it wrinkles 
and slirivels up, which spoils their nppear- 
ance, as they ought to be quite smooth and 
even ; the cakes also require considerable 
care in the baking ; they sliould be slightlv 
cobred on the top and the k>wer part red- 
dish.

to buke in a moderate oven, first strewing 
on tiiem four ounces of sweet almonds minced 
and mixed with two ounces of powder-sugar, 
and a little white of egg. When done, cut 
them into all possible forms, then replace 
tliem in the oven to dry ; when brittle, take 
tliem out, let tliem cool, and decorate them 
to your fiiincy.

tlie same time have the almonds scakling 
hot in another pan ; dien mix them togedier 
with the whites of three eggs beaten to frotii, 
and let it stand until it is cold ; then roll it 
with aome of the sugar left out for tliat 



narpose, and by them in pbtters of paper.

stirring (liem continually, until lliey crackle 
and fly about, and the sugar begins to color, 
stir them about gently lb gatlier the sugar, 
and leave them in the pan to dry about two 
hours, in a stove or any moderate heat. 

ALMONDS, RED CRISPED. Pre- 
pare them as abiive until they have taken 
the sugar and are ready to be taken off tiie 
fire, put the almonds upon a sieve with a 
dish under, take the sugar that drops, and 
put it into the same pan, adding a little 
fresh ; refine it till it comes to tlie twelfth 
d^ree au caa^e, then take cochineal, color

weight of a macaroon. Place them on white 
paper and on an iron plate, fry them in a mo- 
derately hot stove. If they are of a deep 
yellow, tlicy are sufficiently done. — ^Tliese 
Bweetmeats may be still further ornamented 
in the following manner: — Boil some sugar 
in orange-flower water to the degree called 



grande pbumeit and as soon as the 
meats are taken from tlie stove or oven, wash 
ihem over with a light bnish dipped in the 
sirup ; this will give tliem a delicious per- 
fume, and they may then be called d la 
giaee. Whoi cold, take tliem fi-om the 
paper and put them into glasses for the taUe. 

ALMONDS, ROCK OF AUCAN- 
TE, SPANISH. Clarify honey, and 
stir into it as many blanched almonds as

spread the paste on wafer paper with the 
blade of a knife (tlie wafer paper must be 
rubbed with virgin wax and sweet oil) \ lay 
tlie preparation on as thin as possible ; chop 
some sweet almonds very small, mix tliem 
with sugar, and strew tliem over the wafers 
and put them into a hot oven ; wlien about 
half baked, take them out and cut tliem in 
squares ; replace them a minute in the oven, 
lake Uiem out again, and press them on a 
stick to give them the proper form ; as soon 
as they are cold, put them on a sieve. Just 
liefore they are served they should be slightly 
warmed. 

ALMOND COMPOTE, GREEN. 
Take tlie peel very carefully from your al« 
roonds, and put them with water on llie fire 
till they are tender ; tlien take them oflf and 
add a little more water ; when nearly cold 
put them on tlie fire again, but do not let 
them boil ; as soon as you find the liead of 
a pin will penetrate easily, they are then 
sufficiently done, and may be Uirown into 
cold water ; and when the fruit is quite cold, 
drain them. In the meantime put some 
clarified sugar on tlie fire, and when it boils 
put in the almonds ; boil them in the sugar 
about twenty times, tlien remove tliem, and 
let the almonds stand to take die sugar : in 
about two hours' time put them on tlie fire 
again, and boil them up a dozen times ; afler 
which, tiike them ofll, skim, and let them 
cool. When quite cool drain and put the 
fruit in a compotier. If the sugar shoukl 
not be sufficiently done, boil as much more 
as you may tliink necessary ; squeeze in the 
juice of all orange, boil it once again, and 
when nearly cold strain it througli a cloth 
into the cotnpotier over the almonds. 

ALMOND NONPAREILS, GREEN.

and dry them in a stove, or gentle oven. 

ALMOND (GREEN) PRESERVED. 
Put some water into a aauoepan, wiib two 
haodfub of bran, and when it has boiled up 
twice, throw in some green alioonds ; let 
them boil up once, tlien take them out with 
a skimmer, and rub them well in your hands 
to take off the down ; as voo do this, throw 
them into coki water ; then boil them in 
water tiH, on pricking them, a pin easily 
enters and they shrink : then clarify some 
n^r, a pound to a pound of fniit ; boil up 
the sirup four or five successive da^s, morn- 
ing and evening, without the fruit, which 
you leave to drain npon a sieve ; lastly, put 
the fruit into a pan, and when ratlier more 
than lukewarm, pour the sirup over it ; when 
diey kx^ very green they are sufficiently 
done*

liqueur, pass tlie whole through a strainer, 
and put into bottles. 

ANGELICA CAKES. Take four oun- 
oes of angelica powder, and two pounds of 
fine su^r. Beat up the white of an egg 
with a liltle sifted sugar, until it is of tiie con- 
sistence of cream clieese ; dissolve llie sugar 
in a skillet and skim it ; when it lias boiled 
a little, throw in the angelica, and boil tlie

fire, put in half a spoonful of the beaten ^g, 
and stir it quickly until the sugar rises, tlien 
stop, and when it has fallen again, stir till 
it rises a second time ; it may now be pour- 
ed into moulds or paper cases, well oiled and 
sprinkled with sifted sugar. 

ANGELICA (ESSENCE of) JELLY. 

Having washed and well dried two ounces of 
angelica-roots ; cut tliem in pieces and tlirow 
them into boiling sirup, (three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar,) with an ounce of bruised 
angelica seeds ; cover the mixture close, and 
when cold, add to it half a glass of kirtch- 
toasser, and pass it through a tammy ; then 
filter, and afterwards put to it an ounce of 
isinglass : stir it lightly with a silver spoon ; 
pound ten pqpnds of ice, and put it into a 
nree sieve or pan, place your mould in the 
middle of the ice, uking care that it touches 
the ioe in every part; poor the jelly into the 



mould, oofer it with a sauoepMi lid, prt fav 
on that, and let it stand for three boors ; after 
that time have rently a saucepan forge enough 
to take in the RKNild easily ; fill it with water 
80 warm that you can scarcely bmr your hmd 
in it); plunge the moofcT in 00 as to 9linw die 
water to paaa over t*» iirfit»te,THit aa cpiicUy 
as possible. And then turn the jelljr into yoor 
di«b for table. This last operation should 
be performed with ereat agility. Ofanerve, 
in making these kind of jellies, that no lioaed 
or pewter vessels or spoons sliould be used, 
as diey impart a violet tinge to your jellies, 
which ought to be of the cok>r of the ingre- 
dients employed, as for instance tiie abover 
should be a dear light green cobr. 

ANGELICA LIQUEUR. Wadi, 

scrape, and cut in small pieces, twelve ounces 
of fresh, or half the quanti^ of Bohemian 
angelica roots, and infiue them for a week 
in six pints of brandy and one of wafer,, with 
a drachm of mace, two drachms of cinnanKMi, 
and twelve cloves ; at the end of diat itine 
distil it, then dissolve three pounds of sugar 
in three pints of water ; mix it with tiie 
liqueur, strain it through a jelly-bag, or fil- 
ter it through paper. Obeo-ve, that the best 
brandy for liqueurs is that which is made 
at Montpelier, as it yiekls more in distiila' 
tion than the Ct^iac. Take notice also, 
diat Che first drops which fall from the alem- 
bic after it is placed on the stove, must noC 
be mixed with tlie liquem*. A glass should, 
therefore, be placed under the mouth of the 
alembic to receive them, and whoi about a 
quarter of it is filled you may remove it, uid 
place your bottles or matrass. Tlie plilegm, 
as th^ droppings are caltiody are good for 
notliing.

pithy angelica stalks, boil them till tender, 
drain and press all the water out ; beat them 
in a mortar to a paste, and rub li through a 
sieve. Next day dry it over the fire, and to 
every pound of paste put a pound of powder- 
sugar. When the paste is hot add the sugar, 
stirring it till thorouglily mixed, over a goitle 
fire. Drop it on plates, dust a little sugar 
over them, and dry them in a stove. 

ANGELICA PRESERVED. Taketfae 
stalks of angelica when of a good siie, hut 
before they have run to seed ; clear off the 
leaves, and as voo cut the stalks into proptf 
lengths throw tliem into water, and boil tiieni 
till the stalks are soft ; take them from the 
fire, and put them into cold water ; take off 
the skin, and again put them into cold water; 
tlien drain and put them into an earllmi ntf, 
and pour over a sofiicient quantity of clarifaii 
sugar to float the angelica. In tweaty-Ciar 
hoNin boil the wgar tea or a doiea tiae*,

Proceed in the same way fcnr four suooeeding 
days ; after which, drain die stalkB, and in 
the nieanwbife boil the sugar (adding more, 
if neoeaaary) to the degree grande ptrU } 

Eit the angelica to tliis, cover it close, and 
t it boil five or six times. Take it from 
the fire, scum, and put it by in pots. 

ANGELICA PRESERVED DRY. 
Proceed as for the liquid, until yrm have 
poured tlie sugar au grand perU over the 
angelica ; leave it for a day in tlie sugar, 
then drain and dry it on slates, or iron plates, 
in a stove. 

ANGELICA RATAFIA. Take six 
pints of brandy, a pint of river water, three 
pounds of sugar, two mmces of fresh gathered 
angelica-roots, the same quantity of angelica 
seed ; mace and clove, a drachm of each.

to the same quantity ; add cloves and cinna- 
mon ; let it stand six weeks, then filter and 
bottle it. 

ANGELICA WATER. Wash eight 
handfuls of angelica leaves, cut, and lay them 
on a table to dry. When quite dry, put 
them in an eartlien pot with a gallon of strong 
fvine lees. Let it stand' tweniy-four hours, 
stir it twice in that tifne, tlien put it into a 
warm still or alembic ; draw off into bottles, 
covered widi paper pricked in holes, and let 
them stand thus two or three days. Sweeten 
it, and when it is settled, bottle, and stop it 
close. 

ANISEED, OIL OF. Is made like ani- 
seed water, the only difference is, that an 
additional pound of sugar is necessary to 
make the sirup. 

ANISE PETIT PAINS. Put two 
glasses of water and two ounces of fresh but- 
ter into a stewpan, and when the liquid boils 
take it from the fire, and mix with it six 
ounces of sifted flour ; amalgamate it Uior- 
ouglily, so that it may be quite free from 
lamps ; tlien dry it over the fire. Take it 
out of the .saucepan, and .add to it two eggs, 
9Dd two ounces of powder-sugar; mix tliem 

22* 



wen in, and then pot in two move eggs and 
the xesU of a lemon minced fine : when 
these are also well incorporated, add another 
egg or two, if the paste (which should be ra- 
tlier firm,) will bear them. Sprinkle your 
paste slab with flour, cut the paste into 
pieces, each tlie size of a vralnut ; roll Uiese 
widi as little flour as possible, to about three 
incites long, and as you roll them place tliem 
on a hnking-tin, two inches apart; dorez 
and bake tliem in a tolerably warm oven till ' 
they ai'e firm. Then cut some anise into 
fillets, boil a .quarter of a pound of sugar to 
ettss^y and the moment it reaches that de- 
gree set it by the side of the fire that tlie 
sugar may not lose its' whiteness; dip the 
top and one side of etich petit pain m tlie 
sugar as quick as possible, and as you take 
them out, strew the anise over them lightly, 
lied anise is also used for tliese petit 
pains, 

ANISEED RATAFIA. To make a 
quart of this li({ueur, l)oil a pound of sugar 
with a demisetier of water, until the sugar 
is (]uite clear ; then heat another demisetier 
of water, and put in it three ounces of anise ; 
take it from the fire before it boils ; let it 
stand a quarter of an hour, and then pour it 
with three pints of brandy into tlie sugar; 
mix all well together, and then pour into a 
vessel, which must be closed tight, and 
placed in the sun. Let it stand three weeks, 
and then bottle it. 

ANISEED WATER. Qioose eight 
ounces of new green anise, sift it well to 
free it from the dust, and then infuse in six 
pints of brandy, wiUi the zcstes of three 
lemons, and half an ounce of cinnamon ; in 
a week's time distil it over a moderate fire, 
put a pint of water into die alembic; take 
care to collect the phlegm before you draw 
ofi* the an iseed water. Dissolve three pounds 
of sugar in dirce pints of water. As the 
anise contains an acid salt, which renders 
this liqueur milky, die following proceeding 
is necessary :-^Reserve a pint of the water 
from that in which you dissolved the suffar, 
and mix with the white of three or four 
eggs, well whipped, and while the sirup is 
hot put to it this egg-water and ,the aniseed 
water; stir it over the fire until the whole 
is hot without boiling; then put it into a 
glass jar, cork it well, and let it stand ; the 
next day bottle and filter it. 

ANISETTE DE BORDEAUX. Take 
two ounces of green aniseed, half a pound 
of aniseed, two ounces of coriander, and the

BOUCHEES PETITES, PEIO^EES. 

Your bouehieB heme made and baked a 
above, whip the whites of two eggs to t 
firm froth, and mix them with four spooo^ 
fuls of sifted sugar, and when very smooth, 
mask your boucheet with it: then take 
some while of egg, and wi^ the point of a 
knife, drop ihem in peaHs about the shte of 
a grape*«tone, round each bowchety half aa 
indi apart, spi-inkle them lightly with s^gfar, 
and dry the egg in the oven, takii^ care 
they do not lose their whiteness. 

When cold, place between each pearl a 
smaHer one of red-currant jefly. Fill yoor 
boueheea with apricot roannalade, appl^ 
jelly, &c. ; if, however, the jelly, or whato 
ever else you may use, be c^ a red cdor, 
your intermediate pearls should be composed 
of light-colored preserve, such as apricot 
marmalade, &c. lliese shoirid be pearled 
a few at a titne only. 

BOUCHEES PETITES, PRALJ- 

NEES. Hnvingf prepared die bmiekeeaBB 
nsuul, dorez and hake them in a moderate 
oven ; when they are of the proper color, 
ma^k them with whites of eggs mixed with 
sugar, and almonds minced very smal/; re- 
place them in ^ oven a mioote or two, 
and then strew red, or any othor colored 
sugar on tbem, but not so thick as to cover 
the almonds entirely. Fill the boucheet 
as usual. 

BOUCHEES PETITES, a la 
Reine. The same as aboTe, only the 
paste must be cut thicker, and before yoa 
dorez, let diem stand a few minutes. Bake 
in a brisk oven. 

BUCKTHORN, SIRUP OF. (1) Gath- 
er the berries in the heat of the day, and set 
in an earthen vessel in the oven; aqaeeaeoot 
the jnice, and for each peck of berries pM 
two pounds of white sugar, and boil tfwm 
together a quarter of an hour; let it co(^ 
and then bottle it. 

BUCKTHORN, SIRUP OF. (2) Take 
three quarts of the juice of clarified bock- 
thorn berries, end four pouads of farvwn 
sugar ; make them into a airap over a gende 
fire, and while warm, nux with it a drada 
of the distilled oil of ck>ves, ilisaolved on a 
lump of sugar. The true buckthorn may Ik

CAKES MADE OF FLOWERS. Boil 
double refined sugar to a candy height^ and 
strew in your flowers and let tliem boil 
once up; then, with your hand, lightly 
strew in a little double refined sugar sifted, 
and put it directly into little pans made of 
card, and pricked full of holes at the bot- 
tom ; you must set tlie pans on a cushion, 
and when they are cold, take them out. 

CAKES, HONEYCOMB. Boil your 
£Ugar to a candy height ; tlien put in your 
flowers, which must l)e cut; have little pa- 
pers with four corners ready ; drop some of 
your candy on the {tapers^ take them off 
when ready, and if tliey are rightly done, 
they will look full of holes like honeycombs. 

CAKES, LIQUORICE. Take hyssop 
and red rose water, of each half a pint, half 
a pound of green liquorice, tiie outside 
scraped off, and then beat with a jjcstle; 
put to it half a pound of aniseed?, and steep 
it all night in the water; boil it with a 
gentle fire till the taste is well out of the 
liquorice ; stJ-ain it, put to it three pounds 
of liquorice powder, and set it on a gentle 
fire till ii is come to the thickness of cream ; 
take it off, and put to it half a pound of 
white sugar candy seeied very fine; beat 
this well together for at least three Itours, 
and never suffer it to stand still; as you 
beat it, you must sti'ew in double-refined 
sugar finely seered, at least three pounds; 
half an hour before it is finished, put in lialf 
a spoonful of gum dragon, steeped in or- 
ange-flower water: when it is very white 
then it is beat enough ; roll it up with white 
sugar; and if you want it perfumed, put in 
Si pastil or two. 

. CANDYING. Fruit intended for can- 
d^^'ing must be first preserved, and dried in 
a stove before the fire, that none of the sir- 
up may remain in it. Sugar intended for 
toe use of candying must be thus prepared : 
put into a tossing-pan a pound of sugar, 
with half a pint of water, and set it over a 
Tery clear fire. Take oflf the scum as it 
rises; boil it till it looks clear and fine, and 
take out a little in a silver spoon. When 
it is cold, if it will draw a thread from 
your spoon, it is boiled enough for any kind 
of sweetmeat. Then boil your sirup, and 
irhea it b^ios to candy round the edge of 



yoor- jmh U ia candy lieigiit, It isiii _. „ 
qaistaKe to put a^y kind of sneetpieftl vmf 
too thick a simp, specially at th#- first, m 
it withers the fpait^ aod both tlie.beauty'4M4 
^vor are thereby destroyed. 

CANDY FLOWERS. Take thf 
best trebiexrefiiied sttgar, bi^eak it mM9 
lumps, and dip it piece by piece iqto wilep ; 
put them into a vessel of silver, aad ipelt 
them over the fire; when it just boik» 
strain it, and set it on the fire agaiv, ani} 
lei it boil till it draws in hairs, which yen 
may perceive by holding up your spoon;, 
tlien put in llie flowers, and set them in eupt 
or glasses. Wl)en it is of a hard candy, 
breiik it in lumps, and lay it as high as yew 
please. Dry it in a stove, or in the suo^ 
and it will look like sugar-caody. 

CANDY, ALL SORTS OF FRUIT. 
When finished in the sirup, put a layer into 
a new sauce, and dip ii suddenly into hot 
water, to take off the sirup that hangs aboot 
it; put it on a napkin l)efore the fire to 
drain, and then do some more on the sieve. 
Have rpady-sifted double-refined sugar, 
which sifl over the fi'uit on all sides, till 
(|uitc white. Set it on the shallow end oi 
ti)c sieves in a lightly-warm oven, and turn 
it two or three times. It must not be cold 
till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will lie 
beautiful. 

CANELLONS. Make a stiff paste, 
with a little melted butter, a spoonful or 
two of water, some rasped lemon-|)eel, aa 
egg, a quarter of a pound of flour, and half 
that quantity of sugar; roll it very thin; 
make a little cane of card-paper, butter it 
well on the outside, and wrap it in some of 
the paste; bake it a few minutes; take out 
the card, and fill the paste with currant jel- 
ly, or any other jelly or sweetmeat you 
please. 

CANNELLONS MERINGUES. Whip 
tlie whites of two eggs, and having mixed 
tliem with two spoonfuls of powder-sugar, 
then mask the cannellons; when baked, 
cnjsh a quarter of a pound of fine sugar, 
and roll the cannellons in it; replace them 
a few minutes in the oven, and then finish. 
The^miisking of these cannellons may be 
varied according to t:\6te, with pistacliioe, 
dried currants, &c. the fonner cut in pieces, 
the latter well washed, dried and mixed 
with an equal quantity of sugar. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OF. T^ 

capillaire of Canada, although tliat of Montr 
peiier is equally good, is a very odori£b- 
rous vegetable, light and agreeable, but 00 
extremely volatile,^ that the greatest part pf

k if diiBipBted daring the preparation of 
tiM simp. To prea er r c then the odoor of 
Ikt capillaire, when ^roor sirap w snfficient- 
W done, pour it, whibt boiling, upon some 
mA capiUaire ooaraely chopped up; then 
cover your venel, and let it etsuad until it 
It quite cold, then pass it through a bolting- 
dodi to separate it from the leaves of i^ 
camlhire. 

Take one ounce of the capillaire from 
Oanada; put it into u glazed pan, pour upon 
it fbu#pintB of boiling watcr^ leave it to in- 
fbse for twelve hoiini over some warm ashes ; 
strain it and let it run into a vessel, it will 
give you a strong tincture of capillaire; 
meh in tliis tincture four pounds of sugar, 
put the whole into a preservine-pan, and 
put it on the fire, and clarify ii with the 
while of an egg, continue the cooking ; when 
your sirup is perfe, put some fresh capil- 
laire, chopped, into a pan, and pour your 
sirup, whilst boiling, upon it; cover your 
pan carefully, and let it cool; when your 
sirup is cold, you may flavor il if you please. 
Put it into bottles, and cork diem hermeti- 
cally. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OF. (2) Take 
|H)me good capillaire, chop it up, not \ety 
small, put it upon a sieve; pour upon it 
some boiling water, and then let it infuse 
for ten hours in a vessel well covered ; strain 
this infusion, and put into it some sugar 
boiled au casse; clarify this sirup with the 
whites of ^gs whipped; skim it till it is 
very clear ; wlien it rises, take it off the 
fire, and leave it to cool, then put it into 
bottles. 

Viard and Beauvilliers, whose receipts 
ai'e nearly the same, boil tlieir capillairc for 
a quarter of an hour in river- water; after 
having passed this boiling through a sieve, 
they put into it some powder-sugar, and 
clarify tlieir sirup with water, or a whole 
q^g beaten up; then skim it, and when it is 
veiy clear and has boiled au lisse, they 
take it off the fire, and put into it some 
orange-flower water, and strain it through 
a napkin or straining-bag, leaving it to 
cool before putting it into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sirup, you 
must use two good ounces of capillaire, four 
pints of water, and fow pounds of sugar, 
powder-sugar is the best, as it prevents sir- 
ups from candying. 

CARAMEL. Break into a small copper 
or brass pan one pound of refined sugar ; 
put in a gill of spring-water ; set it on a 
fine; when it boils skim it quite clean, and 
let it boil ouick, till it cxymea to the degree 
called cracK ; which may be known by dip- 
piuff a tea-spoon or skewer into the sugar, 
fuia letting it drop to the bottom of a pan 



of cold water; and if it remains bard, kham 
attained that degree : squeeze in the joSoe 
of half a lemon, and let it remain one mbk- 
ute longer on the fire ; then set the 'pan into 
another of cold water : have ready mooUi 
of any diape; rub them over with sweet 
oil ; dip a spoon or fork into the sugar, and 
throw It over the mould in fine tlu-eads, till 
it is quite covered: make a small handle of 
caramel, or stick on two or three small gun 
paste rings, by way of ornament, and {wioe 
it over small pastry of any description. 

CARAMEL CONSERVE. Clarify the 
quantity of sugar you may require, and boil 
K. to cai-amel; have ready some cases of 
double paper; pour in your sugar to the 
thickness of half an inch, and truce on its 
surface the forms you wish it to have ; when 
cold, break it accordincr to tlioae marks. 
This conserve may be colored* and flavored 
according to the fancy. 

CARAMEL COVER FOR SWEET- 
MEATS. Dissolve eight ounces of double- 
refined sugar in tliree or ibur spoonfuls of 
water, and three or four drops of lemon- 
juice; then put it into a copper untimied 
skillet; when it boils to be thick, dip the 
handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a 
pint basin of water, squeeze the sugar from 
die spoon into it, and so on till you have all 
the sugar. Take a bit out of the water, 
and if it snaps and is brittle when cold, it is 
done enough ; but only let it be thi'ee parts 
cold, then pour the water from the sugar, 
and having a copper mould oiled well, ran 
the sugar on it, in the manner of a maze, 
and when cold you may put it on the dish it 
is to cover ; but if, on trial, tlie sugar is not 
brittle, pour off the water, and return it in- 
to the skillet, and boil it again. It should 
look tiiick like treacle, but of a bright light 
gold color. It makes a most elegant cover. 

CARDAMUM COMFITS. Procure 

your cardamums at the chemists, and they 
will be in a shell; put tliem into the oven to 
dry the skins, and (liey will break; pick all 
the seeds fi*om them, put the seeds into a 
large comfit-pan, and have a fire under die 
same as for otliers ; mix your gum, stoicb, 
and sirup, and finish them the same as caflu 
way comfits. 

CARAWAY CAKE. Dry a quarter 
of a peck of fine flour in an oven ; rub a 
pound .and a half of fresh butter in it, till it 
is crumbled so small that none of it is to be 
seen ; then take six spoonfuls <^ rose water, 
half a pint of canarv, half a pint of creaa, 
and tliree-quarters ol a pint of new ale veait, 
an 1 the whites of two, and yolks oi to 
^gs; mix all these weU togetber, let k lit

before ^ fire, and when you make it up 
put in a pound and a half of Naples biscuitB, 
and three-quarters of a pound of caraway- 
oomfitB. Bake it. 

CARAWAY COMFITS. Take some 
fine caraway seeds, sift all die dust from 
tfaem, and have a large copper preserving- 
pan, about two feet wide, and with two 
handles and two pieces of iron made as a 
ring on each side ; then you must have a 
pulley fixed to the beam, and a cord with a 
book to ^ich end, so as to fix it at each 
side of the pan to let it sling; then have 
some fine starch as white as you can get, 
and just soften it, boil some simp a quarter 
of an hour, and mix it with the starch; 
take some gtim arabic, put it into some 
water, then put that into anollier pan, and 
make it just warm ; have an iron-pot with 
charcoal fire under the large pan, but not 
too hot, only just to keep the yxm warm ; 
have a large tub to put your pot of fire at 
bottom, and your large pan must Ire on the 
top; put the caraway seeds into your pan; 
add a large ladleful of gum arabic, rub them 
with your hands until you find they are all 
dry, then put a ladleful of starch and sirup, 
and do tlie same over your pan of fire, until 
you find tliey are all dry ; put the gum only 
three or ibur times to them at first, tiien the 
starch and Hugar, but boil your sirup more 
as you find they come to coat with it, and 
not so much starch ; when you have dried 
tliem seven or eight times, put them into 
your sieve; put them into the stove, do 
tbem the next day, and so, successively, fur 
six or seven days. 

CARAWAY DRAGEES. Take any 
quantity of -caraway seeds you think proper, 
put them into a pieserving-pan, and when 
quite warm, put in clarified sugar, a little 
at a time, stirring it occasionally, till of the 
size you wish; then proceed as directed for 
Almond Drageea, 

CASSIA CANDIED. Pound a little 
musk and ambergris with as much of the 
powder of cassia as will lie on two shil- 
lings. Having pounded them well together, 
take a quarter of a pound of fine sugar, and 
aa much water as will wet it, and boil it to 
a candy lieiglit, then put in your powder 
and mix well together. Butter some pew- 
ier saucers, and when it is cold turn it out. 

CASSIA RATAFIA OF. Take a 
pound of cassia, half a pound of bitter 
cherries, a quarter of a pound of cassia 
leaves, and half a drachm of cinnamon; 
bruise the two first, cut up the leaves, and 
pound the cinnamon, infuse these ingredi- 
ents in three qeart^ of brandy for three

CEDRATS, BLANCMANGE OF, 

Grate the rind of a cedrat upon some sugar 
in the usual way, until six ounces of sugar 
have been used ; blanch and pound a poand 
of sweet almonds, moistening them with 
water; when perfectly smooth, dilute them 
with five glasses of water put in by degrees ; 
then pour them in a napkin, and squeezing 
it, express the milk of almonds from them; 
divide this into two equal parts, with one 
of which mix the six ounces of su^r widi 
the cedrat, and with the other portion, mix 
the same quantity of plain sugar; as soon 
as both are dissoIve<l, strain them, and pat 
in each half an ounce of isii^lass: your 
mould being placed in ice, pour into it the 
white blancmange to three-quarters of an 
inch in depth ; as soon as that is set, poor 
in an equal quantity of the other, which 
ought to be of a clear yellow; when that 
also is set, pour in some white, and so on 
alternately, till the mould is full. Turn oat 
tlie blancmange as directed in BUmcmangt 
French, 

CEDRAT, CONSERVE OF. Grate 
the rind of a cedrat all round, until the juice 
is ready to ooze out ; diis must be done by 
rubbing it against a large piece of sugar, 
(about a pound;) remove the surfec^ ot 
this sugar, to which the grated rind adheres, 
with a knife, and squeeze to it half the juice 
of the cedrat. Dissolve the remainder oi 
the sugar to the degree grande phime, 
then take it from the fire, and when it has 
«tood a little while, put in your cedrat, stir- 
ring it with a spoon, until a sort of ice 
forms on the top ; you may then pour your 
conserve into moulds. Be careful not to 
put it in too hot. 

CEDRAT ZESTES, JELLY OF. 
Take three-quarters of a pound of lump su- 
gar, grate on it the ze9te» of two cedrats, 
and, as the sugar becomes colored, scrape 
it off with a knife, and grate again, and so 
on until all the zette is gone; dissolve the 
scraped sugar in two glasses of water, and, 
with the juice of four lemons, pass it throueh 
a jelly bag. Clarify the remainder of the 
sugai', and then put a fourth of it into a 
small preserving pan; boil it to caramel 
height, to color the jelly; mix this, the 
fi-uit, the sirup, and an ounce of isinglass 
together, apd finish in the usual way. 

CHANTILLY BASKET. Dip some 
ratafia cakes into clarified sugar boiled to 
caramel height ; place them round the in- 



CHE 



370 



OHfi 



side of ft dish; tben cut more mtafia cakes 
into squares, dip theoi also into sugar, and 
pile them tomer-ways on the row, aod so 
oo for two or three stories high. Line the 
inside with wafer-paper, and fill it with 
sfKMtge biscuit, sweetmeats, blanched al- 
monds, or some made cream; put trifle 
over that, and garnish the froth witii rose- 
leaves, colored comfits, or caramel sugar 
thrown lightly over tlie top. 

CHERRIES IN BRANDY. Choose 
the finest and ripest cherries, leave on half 
tlie stalks, and put them into very cold wa- 
ter. Ill about iialf an hour take them out, 
and drain tliem on a sieve; weigh them, 
and to every pound of fruit, allow a quarter 
of a pound of sugar ; when you have clarified 
and boiled it to grand perUy put in the 
fruit, boil them up two or three times, stir- 
ring them gently witK a skimmer; then take 
them from the fire carefully, and put the 
clierries into bottles or gbss jars; when 
filled, add to each twelve cloves and lialf an 
oum« ol* cinnamon tied in a linen bag. Put 
to tlie sugar, when nearly colrl, brandy (in 
the proportion of a pint and a Imlf to a 
pound of fruit); mix them together well, 
and pour them on the cherries. In two 
monthd time taste them, and if sufficiently 
flavored, take out the cloves and cinnamon. 
Cover the jars or bottles close. 

CHERRIES, TO CANDY. The fruit 
must be gathered before it is ripe; prick 
and stone them; boil clarified sugar, and' 
pour it over them. 

CHERRY ICE. Take the stones and 
stalks from two pounds of ripe cherries, 
bruise, and set them on ihe fire with a little 
water, and half a pound of sugar. When 
the}' have boiled, pass them through a hair 
sieve into an earthen pan. Pound a handful 
of tlie kernels, put them in a basin with the 
juice of two lemons. Add to the cherries a 
pound of sugar cm petit luse, and strain on 
them the louon-juice and kernels ; mix the 
whole tc^iether, and put it in a tabotieret 
with pounded ice. Work the cherries up 
with it well, until it has set, then place it in 



CHERRY ICE CREAM. Take half a 
pound of preserved clierries, pound them, 
stones and all ; put them into a basin, with 
one gill of sirup, the juice of a lemon, and a 
pint of cream, pass it through a sieve, and 
freeze it according to custom. 

CHERRY MARMALADE. Choose 
the ri|ie8t, largest, best red colored cherries, 
you can meet with, and take of them double 
the weight of the sugar you intend to use; 



stone aod tail ; and then pot them m ^ 
gentle fire, and keep stirring theui till re- 
duced to half. Clarify and boil your sifjar 
to petti ceu$e, then add the fruit to it, uid 
stir it until you can see the bottom of the 
pan ; the marmalade is then sufficiently done, 
and may be put into pots. 

CHERRY MARCHPANE. Take three 
pounds of sweet almonds, two and a half 
of sugar, and a pound of cherries ; pound 
tlie almonds to a paste, and mix it with the 
sugar, boiled to petit boule; then havii^ 
stoned, well bruised, and squeezed out the 
juice of the clierries, add it to the rest, sthr 
it well, place it on liot aslies, stirring con- 
stantly until the paste is properly done; 
then finish, it in the usual way, (See 
Marchpane.) Strawberries, raspber- 
ries, currants, or any other fruit may be 
used in the same way. 

CHERRY RATAFIA. Crush ten 
pounds of cherries, and pot them into a jar 
witli a quart of brandy ; cover Uie jar close, 
and infuse the cherries for five or six days; 
at the end of that time put the. fruit into a 
cloth, arid press the juice oat through. Boil 
five pounds of fine currants, with three pounds 
of sugar, and press out the juice as you did 
that of the cherries; mix the two juices, 
measure them, and for every pint allow a 
pint of brandy. Add a pound of the kernel 
of the cherry-stones, half a poond of corian- 
der, a little mace, some cloves and cinna- 
mon, all well pounded, put them into a jar, 
and poor the liquor over tlicm ; cover it 
close and let it infuse for six weeks,' after 
which, pass the whole through a jelly-bag, 
and bottle it ; cork it carefully. 

CHERRIES, SIRUP OF. The best 
cherries for this purpose are tlie black sour 
ones ; take out ttie stones and express Ae 
juice into an earthen pan, where it must 
stand in a cool place for twenty-foiv hours 
to clear: at the end of that time poor the 
juice gentlv into a pan, and add to it, for 
each pound of juice, two pounds of crushed 
sugar, and two diuchms of cinnamon, pit- 
viously infused in a glass of water, wrap tfie 
cinnamon in a piece of linen, and pot it with 
the water into your pan ; boif all together 
for half an hour, skimming it carefii%. 
When sufficiently done take out the ciimfe- 
mon; strain the sirup till quite clear, and 
when cold bottle it. 

CHESTNUTS IN CARAMEL. (1) 

Roast chestnuts as for the table ; take off 
the skins ; dip each in the whites of egp 
beaten, and then roll them in powder-euear; 
lay iliein separately on paper to dry, is s 
moderate oven ; they may be cut into (fi^

fferent Shim if you think fwoper, and glawd 
either white or brown. 

CHESTNUTS IN CARAMEL. (2) 
Cut some osier rodw or reeds into pieces 
about two or three inclies long, and on the 
point of each put a roasted and skinned 
chestnut. Take a piece of very fresh but- 
ter, (alwut tlie size of a nut), and rub it 
wiUi the palm of the hand, on an iron plate 
or marble slab, taking care to rub every 
part well. Then having boiled some clari- 
fied sugar to caramel height; take a piece 
of the osier, with a chestnut on the end, in 
oach hand, and dip them in the sugar, twist- 
ing them round repeatedly, that the sugar 
may adhere equally about tlie chestnut till 
it oeffins to cool, then lay them on the but- 
tered slab, and dip in two more, proceed- 
ing as above ; when ail are done and cold, 
taxe out the osier twigs, and wrap each 
chestnut in paper, with a device if you 
think proper. Tbnie cliestnuts make a de- 
licious sweetmeat, but they sliould be eaten 
the day on which they are made. 

CHESTNUT COMPOTE. (1) Take 
the outer skin from about a hundred 
chestnuts, and tlien put them into a sauce- 
pan with water, a lemon cut in pieces, and 
three handfuls of bran ; put them on the Hre 
and blanch them: as soon as a pin will go 
into them easily, they are sufficiently done ; 
rub off the second skin, and throw them 
into cold water, with tlie juice of a lemon. 
Clarify and boil a pounfl and a half of sugar 
to petit /tsse, and having drained your 
cbeslnots, put them into the sugar with tiie 
joice of a lemon, tlie quarter of a glass of 
orange-flower water; put these on the fire 
hr a short time, hut not to let them boil : 
then take tliem off and set them by. Tiie 
next day drain the chestnuts, and boil up 
the sirup four times; then add more sugar, 
and having boiled it to sovfflB, put in the 
chestnuts ; blanch tliem instantly afterwards, 
and put them into compotiers. 

CHESTNUT COMPOTE. (2) Roast 
jour chestnuts as for the dessert, and 
when they are peeled and skinned, put them 
into a saooepan, with a quarter of a pound 
of sugar, and half a gnss of water ; let 
them simmer for a quarter of an hour; 
squeeze in a little lemon-juioe, and when 
ready to serve, strew powder-sugar over 
them.

tlicn pound a quailer of a hundred of chest* 
nuts, with a small quantity of milk ; to thie 
add tlie yolks of two eggs, a pint of milky 
a quarter of a pound of powder-sugar, and 
about an ounce of butter. Boil these to- 
gether for some minutes, then strain it, and 
set it by to cool. 

CHESTNUT CUSTARD. Take three 
pounds of well roasted chestnuts, removine 
such parts as were colored by the fire, and 
pound tliem with a pound of fresh butter; 
when a smooth pa»te, add three-<]uarters of 
a pound of powder-sugar, the yolks of 
twelve egg5i, a pinch of salt, and a few

rected. 

CHESTNUT PASTE. Make a mar- 
malade hsf boiling chestnuts in water, and 
rubbing tliem through a sieve, then pound 
them, and to three-quarters of a pound of 
til is, add a quarter of a pound of any other 
fruit marmalade ; mix tliem well up with an 
equal weiglit of sugar boiled to grand 
piume; put it into your moulds and bake it 
as cheiTy, or any other paste. 

CHINESE TEMPLE. Having boiled 
an ounce of double-refined sugar, with half 
an ounce of butter, and a little water, set it 
by till cold, nnd tlieii add to it an egg wdl 
beaten. With this, make fiNir onnces of 
flour into a very stiff paste ; roll it out as 
thin ns possible, and lay it in a set of tins 
the form of a temple, and bake them in a 
slow oven. When cold, take the paste 
from the tins, nnd join each |Meoe together 
according to the proper forms, with isin* 
glass and water. Tlie kiwer part, of 
course, ought to be stron^r than the top, 
in order that it may sustain the weight of 
the whole. The pieces also must oe cut 
as exact as possible to the shape of the 
tins. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. Take a 
pound of chocolate finely grated, and a « 
pound and a half of the best si^r, finely 
sifled ; soak some gum-dragon in orangO' 
flower water, and work them into what 
form you please; the paste must be stiff; 
dry them in a stove. You may write de* 
vices on paper, roll them up, and put them 
in the middle. 

CHOCOLATE BONBONS. Put a 
quarter of a pound of chocolajte over a fire, 
to dissolve it; and having boiled two pounds

thin paste, and then pcnir it on the su^r, 
iBDd boil both together to earanuL In the 
meantime dnelt a little butter, skim, and 
IXMir it off clear into a basin ; take a spoon- 
fiil of it, and rub it with your liand over a 
marble slab or table: on tliie poor the choco- 
late and sugar ; then take two ends of a 
sword-blade, (one in each hand), and press 
lines an inch apart all down it j cross them 
in like manner, so as to mark the su^ar in 
amali squares all over ; doing it as quick as 
possible, lest the sugar should cool before 
you have done ; then pass the sword-blade 
between the marble and the sugar ; lay un- 
der tlie latter sheets of paper ; and when 
cold, break it into pieces according to the 
marks, and wrap each square in paper. 

CHOCOLATE COMFITS. Take two 
ounces of chocolate, beat it small with a 
little warm water over the fire ; when it is 
dissolved and reduced to a paste, pour it 
upon a pound of nuuse pain or sweet 
paste, to which add some cinnamon or va- 
nilla at discretion ; mix the whole well to- 
gether; then spread it over some wafer 
shapes, and bake it in a moderate oven. 
If the paste does not appear deep colored 
enough, you may color it with bohu Ar- 
menicutn. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (1) Dis- 
■olve two ounc^ of good chocolate in a 
little water, put it into a skillet with half a 
pound of sugar boiled to perU ; keep the 
sugar stirring, and when it boils put tlie 
conserve into moulds. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (2) Dis- 
•olve a quarter of a pound of grated choco- 
late in a small quantity of clarified sugar ; 
boil a pound of sugar to the premiere 
plumet pot your chocolate into it, stin*ing 
it well to mix it; serve it whilst it is warm. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. Take one 
pound and a half of chocolate, put it on a 
pewter sheet or plate, and put it in the 
oven just to warm the chocolate ; then put 
it into a copper stewpauj with three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar; 
mix it well over the fire, take it off, and 
roll it in pieces the size of small marbles, 
pat them on white paper, and when they 
are all on, take the sheet of paper by each 
corner, and lift it up and down so tliat the 
paper may touch the table each time, and 
Dy that means you will see the drops come 
quite fat, about the size of a sixpence ; put 
some sugar nonpareils over them, and cover 
all that are on the paper, then shake them 
tuff, and you will see all the chocolate drops 



wt9 oofHcd with the sugar ■o ppar ei i ; ht 
them stand till cold, and they will camt oflf 
well, and then put them in a box piq)and. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (1) 
Take any quantity of chocolate, melt it ovtf 
the fire in a small pan ; when melted poof 
it into that in which you are to make joat 
ci^eamj break your yolks of eggs into it| 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add some 
pounded loaf sugstr to it, keep stirring ooa- 
tinualiy ; then add your cream by little and 
little, stirring and turning it till the whole 
is mixed properly togetlier ; then s^ yoor 
pan over the fire, and keep stirring with a 
wooden spoon till you see your composition 
is near boiling, tlien take it off immediate- 
ly, for, from the moment you set your gom- 
position over the fire till that it ofiers to 
boil, it has sufficient time to iocorporale 
well and thicken sufficiently, without need 
of boiling; and should you let it boil, yoa 
would risk the turning your cream into 
whev, on account of the yolks of eggs, whi(^ 
would do too much. Take great cave 
likewise your cream is fresh and sweet, 
for otherwise as soon as it is warm it wiO 
turn to curds and whey ; therefore, be cara- 
fiil, stir it continually, from the time yoa 
set it on tlie fire till you take it off; then 
put it in the sabot iere to make it congeal 
after tlie usual manner. ^ 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (4) 
Dissolve the chocolate in a little water on 
a slow fire; when properly done, mix it 
witli a pint of cream, three yolks of new 
kiid eggs, and about half a pound of ai^gar. 

CHOCOLATE ICE WATER, Take 
three ounces of chocolate, warm it, and 
mix with it half a gill of sirup, and half a 
pint of water ; mix it well, and freeie it 
thick. 

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS. Pol 

a quarter of a pound of chocolate on a tia- 
plate over a coal fire, and when it is di^ 
solved pour it on a plate ; put to it a spoon- 
fijl or two of sweet almond paste, made m 
for macaroons, stir it jn well, and tlien pour 
it upon the remainder of the almond oaste, 
in which you have mixed a tea-«poonral of 
powdered cinnamon or vanilla, or both: 
beat them tc^ether well in a mortar, kmf 
them on paper, and bake them for threo- 
quarters of an hour in a moderate ov«>. > 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT AMOUR. 
For four bottles of brandy, take one pound 
of the best chocolate, cut in small bit^; a 
little salt, two cloves, and a little cinn^ 
mon ; you must infuse all in the brandy, witi 
two bottles and half a pint of water, with 



CIN

OIH 



wkim of cfgB, and filter k tfaroug^ the pa- 
per. Yoo mivt be careful not to take more 
Aan two bottles from every (bar, except 
from the cinnamon, from which you are to 
take as much as you can get. 

CHOCOLATE PASTILS. Take a 
little chocolate, which put in a pan over the 
fire to melt it ; 9tir it with a gpoon ; when 
it is melted, take half a pound of lonf bu- 

SEtr, pounded in a mortar and silied, which 
issolve in a little clear water. When that 
is done, put in your chocolate ; if you find 
the paste too thick, add a little water, 
enougli to bring it to that degree of liquidity 
that you may take it up on a knife ; Uien 
take half a sheet of pnper, and cover it with 
little round Rnd flat drops, which we call 
paaHlSy of the size of a sixpence ; let tliem 
dry naturally in a cupboard ; and when dry, 
taxe them off from the paper, and put tbeiu 
in boxes. 

CHOCOLATE PASTIL PASTE. 

Melt half an ounce of gum-dragon in a little 
water till it is quite dissolved and thick; 
sift it through a linen cloth, pound it in a 
mortar with a quarter-part of whites of 
eggB, a choc4>late cake bruised, and half a 
pound of fine powder-sugar, mixed by de- 
grees, and adding either more or less sugar, 
according as the paste is malleable ; it must 
be pretty firm ; form it into what flowers or 
designs you please, as shells, lozenges, any 
kind of corn or beans, &c. 

CHOCOLATE PETIT PAINS. These 
are made in tlie same way as Petita Paine 
a la Duchesse (see that article), but with- 
out the dorure. When cold fill them with 
a cream patianere, mixed witli two ounces 
of Tanilla chocolate, and sweetened with 
sugar, flavored with vanilla ; then put three 
ounces of sifted sugar, the same of choco- 
late, and half the white of an e^ into a 
pan; stir these ingredients with a silver 
spoon until you have a smooth transparent 
glaze, with which mask the top and sides 
of the petits pains, spreading it equally 
with the blade of a knife. 

CpOCOLATE SWEETMEATS. 
Take two ounces of chocolate, and break it 
into a little warm water, put it on the fire, 
and when quite dissolved, mix it with a 
pound of marchpane paste, to which may be 
added vanilla or cinnamon ; stir it op well, 
and then spread it on wafer-paiier in what 
Ibrms you please, and bake them in a mod- 
erate oven. If the sweetmeats be not suffix 
cieotly dark colpred,, add a little bol-^mmo- 
Diac. 

CINNAMON Q^XSBk Yikkk. ^ 



half a down eggs with three table*frpnonMi 
of rose water ; add to it a pound of sifted 
mtgBtr, a dessert-spoonful of powdered cinna- 
mon, and a snfllcient qoanlit}' of flour to 
make it into a paste ; roll it ou^ thin, and 
cut it into whatever forms your Ikncy mtiy 
dictate, place them on paper, and bake 
them. Wbeo done, remove them from the 
paper. Keep them dry. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (1) Soak cin- 
namon in water for four and twenty hours, 
and dien cot it into pieces about an inch 
k>ng ; prepare some sugar to grand liaa^^ 
and give the einnannon a boil in it; drain 
and dry it in a stove to the proper consis- 
tence ; then put it in the moulds with sugar 
boiled to amffi^y and when half cold, dry 
it. Before the candy is removed from the 
moulds, they should be laid on one side for 
some time. Keep them in paper in a dry 
place. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (2) Cot 

some cinnamon into small sticks of about an 
inch or an inch and a half long; tliep put 
them into thin sugar, and boil them as it 
were in a sirup. Then take off the pan, 
and set it by for five or six hours to soak, 
take them out and lay them on a wire-grate, 
dry tliem thoroughly in the stove; after- 
wards put them in order in tin moulds 
upon little grates made for the purpose, and 
set into the moulds, so that there may be 
tliree rows set one alx>ve another, separated 
by those grates. In the meantime, boil su» 
gar till it is 6/oton, and pour it into your 
mould, so tliat some of it may lie upon the 
uppermost grate ; then set them in die stove 
with a covered fire, and let them stand all 
night ; the next morning take notice vvhether 
tlie cinnamon be well coagulated ; turn the 
mould upside down, and set it in the stove 
again, with a plate underneath; and when it 
is thoroughly drained, take out your sticks 
of cinnamon, loosening them, by little and 
little, gently; then lay them upon a sieve, 
set in the stove, and dry them thoroughly. 

CINNAMON, CONSERVE OR 

Bruise four drachms of cinnamon, dilute it 
with a little clarified sugar, or sirup of mal- 
lows; boil two pounds of sugar to petit 
casai, tlirow in the cinnamon, stir it well,, 
and then take it from the fire, and when the 
sugar heg\nB to whiten, pour the conserve 
into, cases or moulds, and dry it as usual. 

CINNAMON, DRAGEES OR SU- 
GARED. Soak a quarter of a pound of 
the best cinnamon in sticks, for twelve houm 
in water to soften it ; at the end of that time, 
cut it into slips, by them on a sieve in a 
wttjnn pkiice ^r 9ome. da^. When qai^

Iwd and div, boS ■mm fine Mgar to the 
degree grmuipmrlt; have ready a quantity 
of fine powder, and proceed in die same 
Manner as in doinjf Almond Drageet, 
tmtii die cinnamoo eltclu are of the proper 
ikicknees; diofle which are to be twisted or 
euried, tbouAd not be so thick ae the others. 
Be equally particalar in removing the sugar, 
that cakes on the bottom of the pan, as in 
making Almond Dragees. 

CINNAMON DRAGEES, COMMON. 
Infuse a quarter of a pound of gum-dragon, 
in as much watnr as will cover it; the next 
day put the infusion into a mortar, and stir 
it well with a pestle, and the longer it is 
etirred the whiter it becomes; in ratlier 
more tlian a quarter of an hour, add to it 
tbe caked sugar which was removed from 
the preserving-pan, and which must be well 
pounded and sifted, also a pound of powder- 
sugar, a spoonAil of cinnamon powder, and 
tiy degrees two or three pounds of flour; 
moisten the whole occasionally with water ; 
when tiie paste is of a proper consistence, 
place it on the slab or pasteboard, knead it 
well fur a short time, roll it out in sheets, 
not thicker than the eighth of an incli, and 
then cut it into slips of the same size as the 
.-cinnamon (see above,) put them on paper 
fxr a sieve in a warm place for some days. 
Then boil some common sugar to p£rle, 
and sugar tl«e slips of paste ag above direct- 
•ed ; instead of the fine powder, flour is suifi- 
•cient, until the last two layers, when tiie 
powder may be used to give them whiteness. 
Wlien of the requisite size, lay them on 
sieves to dry. In a few days there may be 
curled, and colored, which is done in the 
•ame manner as coriander seeds. Observe, 
fine sugared cinnamon is always white. 

CINNAMON, ESSENCE OF. This 
is made by infusing oil of cinnamon in 
highly rectified spirits of wine, in the pro- 
portion of half a drachm of the former to an 
ounce of the latter. 



CINNAMON PASTILS. Dissolve 
half an ounce of gum-dragon in a glass of 
water, and strain it through a lawn sieve 
into a lUQttar, and add to it a tea'«poonful 
jOf powdered ciaaaBM>H, and a suiiicient 
quantity of sifted sugar to make the paste of 
« proper coesistenee; form into such figures 
•8 you may fancy, and dry them in a stove. 
Keep them in a dry place. 

CINNAMON SWEETMEATS. Take 
A pound of marchpoxie paste^ and dilute 
It with as many whites of eggs as will 
m»k» it tfufead easily with aJ^uife; add to 
lbis« a spoonful or two of prepared iole-^m^ 
iP«ni9c» tiH<bich will^ive m a fine nd tin^^ 



and half an oiiaoe of ejanapien^wwdtft 
When all theee ingredients are weU mimd* 
cut some wafer-paper into such forma aa ym 
may think proper, and lay on them the paelr 
about the thickness of the eighth of an incbf 
place them on paper, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. When done, th^ may be 
finished in tlte ibiluwing manner :"-*Boil 
some sugar in orange-fiower water, to ib 
plume f and as you take the sweeUneats from 
the oven; dip a hair-pencil into the sirup, 
and brush them over; this dries almost im- 
mediately, and considerably improves tb« 
look of them. 

CINNAMON WAFERS. Pound and 
sift six ounces of sugar, and put it with an 
equal quantity of melted fresh butter, the 
same of flour, half an ounce of powdered 
cinnamon, and a small egg; stirtliese up ia 
an earthenware vessel, witli a suflScient 
quantity of milk to make it into a tliin, but 
not too clear, paste. Make an iron plate 
quite hut, rub it well with butter, then lay 
on it a spoonful of the paste; fry it, and 
when l^own on both sides, roll it, still over 
the hot iron, round a small stick; do this 
until all the paste is used. 

CINNAMONUM. Take a quarter of 
a pound of cinnamon, two draclims of mace, 
and one ounce of stick-liquorice; bruise 
them well, and then put them into three 
quarts of the best brandy ; let the infusion 
stand for some .days befois you distil it; 
dissolve four pounds of sugar m three pints 
and a half of water; mix this sirup with the 
liqueur, and then strain them. This is 
sometimes called Oil of Cinnamon. 

CITRON , CANDIED. Pare tlie citrons 
very thin and narrow, and tlurow them into 
water; these are called faggots; then ciU 
the citron into slices of any diickness yo^ 
think proper ; take out the inner part with 
great care, so as to lea\-e only the white 
ring, and put them with tlie fiiggots into 
boiling water; when tender, drain then. 
Boil a suflicient quantity of clarified aigar 
to souffle; then put in the rings, and boi) 
them together. Take it from the fire, and 
when a little cool, rub tlie sugar against the 
side of die pre:«rving-pan with the back of 
a spoon; as soon as it becomes while, take 
out the rings with a fork very carefully, one 
by one, and lay them on a wire-grate te 
drain : boil and proceed with the faggots in 
a similar. way; when taken out, oit them 
into prcfiec lengths with a pair of sciasQO, 
and lay tliem also on the wire to drain. 

CITRON PASTE. Cut off the ewb 
of the citrons, take out the middle, with al 
the sfods; boil thpai in so^ wntmr^ nei 



CIt 



276 



COF 



wlien quite tender, take th«n (t-ora the fire, 
iukI throw th^n into coM water a moment ; 
dicii, havHig fireseed them in a obtb to eet 
the H'ater out, pound and sifl them. To 
every quarter of a pound of this marmalade 
put half a pound of clarified sugsir; simmer 
them together, stirring constantly until well 
mixed ; then put them into moulds, and place 
tiiem in a stove to dry. 

CITRON WHITE PRESERVED. 
Lay some white citrons, cut into pieces, in 
salt and water for four or five hours; then, 
having waslied them in cold water, boil 
them; when tender, drain, and lay them 
into as much clarified sugar as will cover 
them. The next day drain off" the sirup, 
and boil it; when quite smooth and coli), 
pour It on the citrons; let them stand twen- 
^'-four hours; then boil the sirup again, 
and put in the citrons. The tinrd day, 
boil both together, and put them into moulds 
to candy. 

CITRON PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Cut a slit in the sides of some small citrons, 
60 that the inside may take the sugar as 
well as the outside, and put them over the 
fire in some water; whenever tliey are near 
boiling, put cold water to them. As soon 
as the citrons rise to the top, take them out, 
and throw them into cold water. They 
must then be put on the fire again, in the 
same water, ax\d boiled gently until tender; 
then take them out, and pat them in cold 
water. After this, boil them seven or eight 
times in clarified sugar; pour the whole 
into an earthen pan, and let it stand. The 
next day drain the fruit, and boil up the 
sirup twenty or thirty times; add a little 
more sugar, and pour it over the citrons; 
do this-ior three successive days, increasing 
the degree to which you boil the sugar daily, 
so that at the last boiling the degree may 
be au perle. The fruit may then be put 
faito pots. ' 

To preserve them dry, they must be done 
exactly the same ; only, instead of putting 
the fruit into pots, they should be dried on 
flieyes in a stove. With the reinaining su- 
gar the citrons may be glazed. 

CITRON RATAFIA. Pare seven or 
eight citrons very thin; cut the peel into 
small pieces, and put them into a Jar, with 
three pints of brandy, and let them infuse 
£>r three weeks; then add to this a pound 
of sugar, boiled in half a pint of water, and 
well skimmed; let it stand twelve or fifteen 
ilays longer, 4vhen it may be bottled. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (1) Put into 
9 china bowl alternate layers of fine powder- 
sogar, and citron, pared, and cut in very 



thin slices, and let them stand till the ntxt 
day; then strara off the sirup, and clarify it 
over a gentle fire. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (2) Put tlie 
rinds of three citrons into an earthen ves- 
sel, and strain on them the juice; to this 
put a little water; poor the mixture into a 
basin in which is four pounds of clarified 
sugar, boiled to fort bouUt. Place this 
basin in a large saucepan, half filled with 
water, over the fire ; stir the contents of 
the basin frequently; and when the sugar is 
entirely dist<olved, and the sirup quite clear, 
take the saucepan from the fire, and let it 
cool. As soon as it is cold it may be bot- 
tled. 

CITRONNELLE RATAFIA. For 

two quarts of the best brandy, take the 
zestes or rinds of a- dozen fine sound lem- 
ons, two drachms of bruised cinnamon, an 
ounce of coriander, and two pounds of sii- 
^ar, dissolved in a pint and a half of water; 
mfuse the whole for a month, then strain 
and bottle it. 

CLOVES, OIL OF. This is made in 
the same manner as cinnamonum ; the quanti- 
ties are, an ounce of cloves to tlu'ee quarts 
of brandy, and four pounds of sugar dis- 
solved in four pints of water. 

CLOVE PASTILS. Are made like 
those of cinnamon. The proportions are 
six cloves to half an ounce of gum-dragon. 

CLOVES, SIRUP OF. Put a quarter 
of a pound of cloves, and a quart of boiling 
water into a stewpan, cover it close, and 
boil them gently for half an honr; drain the 
cloves, and to' a pint of the liquor put two 
pounds of sugar; beat up two eggs in a little 
cold water, add them to the above, and sim- 
mer the whole t ill it becomes a strong sirup. 
When cold, bottle it. 

COFFEE BONBONS. Take about a 
pint of coffee made with water ; put in it a 
pound of loaf-suear ; set it on tlie fire and 
boil it to a high degree; then add a full pint 
of double cream, and let it lioil again, keep- 
ing continually stirring till it comes to cara- 
mel height; to know wlien it is come to 
that point, you must have a basin of watw 
by you ; dip your finger in it, and put it 
quickly in your sugar, then in the water 
again, to remove the sugar, which will have 
stuck to it j; take a bit of it in your' teeth ; 
if it is hard in its crackling, take it off, it 
is sufficiently done; pour it upon a tin plate, 
which must be rubbed before with a little 
butter, or it will stick to the plate; then 
spread it with a rolling pin ; (observe, the 



CQN 



^76 



ORE 



.roHing pin must likewise be rubbed with 
"biitter, for fear it should stick;) when it is 
warm, you inay cut it into little sqntn es, lo- 
zenges, or any other shaped pastilles, and 
draw a few strokes over them with a knife. 

COFFEE CONSERVES. Clarify and 
boll to the first degree a pound of sugar; 
take the sugar off the fire, and put into it 
one cup of coffee ; stir it al)out until it comes 
to the sixUi degree, that the conserve may 
take the sugar and di*y. 

COFFEE EGGS. Make some good 
4Strong coffee ; let it rest to clear as usual, 
and sweeten it with sugar according to dis- 
cretion; beat up six yolks of eggs, with 
about four cups of coffee, and sift it; pour 
tliis into little moulds in the form of eggs, or 
of any other, (do not fill them quite,) and 
liaUe in a mild oven, or a Dutch one, or 
with a brazing-pan; cover between two 
fires. They are made after this manner, in 
tlie sliape of any fruits or birds, if you have 
proper moulds, either of copper or china, 
&c. 

COLTSFOOT, SIRUP OF. Take of 
coltsfoot six ounces, maidenhair two ounces, 
hyssop one ounce, liquorice-root one ounce; 
boil them in two quarts of spring water till 
one fourth is consumed ; then strain it, and 
put to the liquor two pounds of fine powder- 
sugar; clarify it with the whites of eggs, 
and boil it till it is nearly as thick as 
honey. 

CONSERVES, DRIED. For all Ports 
of conserves, the sugar should be prepared 
to the ninth degree, according to the quan- 
tity wanted; they are all made much after 
the same manner, the only difference being 
in the quantity of fruits proposed. Con- 
serves are made with all sorts of sweetmeat 
marmalade, sifted in a sieve, and soaked 
pretty dry over a slow fire ; use about half 
a pound of the sugar thus prepared, to a 
quarter of a pound of sweetnoeat marmalade; 
take the sugar off the fire to work them 
well together; warm the whole for a mo- 
ment, and pour it into paper cases made for 
the purpose; when it is cool it may be cut 
into cakes of what size you please. 

CONSERVE OF FOUR FRUITS. 

Take strawberries, currants^ cherries, and 
raspberries, of each a quarter of a pound, 
and three pounds of sugar. Bruise your 
fruit, and having strained off the juice, pot 
it in a saucepan over a gentle fire, stirring 
it till reduced to half. Dissolve the sugar, 
fikim, and boil it to caste; take it from the 
fire while you put in the juice, then put it 
(» again, and give it one boil, take it ofi*. 



and keep stirring till tlie mgnr bubblesyiirheo 
the conserve may be poured into inoukk. 

CONSERVES, HARD IN MOULDS. 
Tliese ai-e made in the same manner as 
other conserves, except that they are com- 
posed of sugar, and distilled aromatic wa- 
ter ; and may be colored like pastils. 

CORIANDER DRAGEES. Take any 
quantity of coriander seeds, put them in the 
tossing-pan over the fire, and let them warm; 
when they are warm throw in about hajfa 
glass of vinegar, stir them well till they are 
dry ; have clarified sugar, which boil in ail- 
bother pan; then when the corianders are 
dry, add a little gum to them, and do the 
same again till they are dry, and continue 
so doing till you see the corianders are cov- 
ered to the size you want to have them; 
when that is done, take the corianders oat 
from the pan, wasii them well, and put theon 
in again, and stir them well till they are all 
warm ; then take your clarified sugar, which 
you have previously boiled to the first de« 
gree; when this is done, put it in an iostm- 
ment of copper, made on purpose lor the 
operation, and at the bottom of which there 
is a little hole ; hang it up by a packthread 
string, that tlie sugar may fsA\ from about a 
yard height into the pan where tlie coriajh- 
ders are ; while the sugar falls into your pan 
keep stirring well your dragees till you see 
they are well pearled over, or rough and 
grainy ; when they are sufficiently so, take 
them out, and place them in the stove to 
finish drying.

the preparation into a mould lighdy buttered 
within side. Put this mould into a brgs 
saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of boil- 
ing water to reach within an inch €^ the 
mould; place the saucepan on hot adies, 
cover it, and place hot coals on the lid; 
renew the fire underneath occasionally, so 
as to keep tlie water at the same tempera- 
ture, that is, nearly, but never quite, boil- 
ing for an hour and a half; then, if the 
cream is properly set, which may be knows 
by touching it with vour finger, and obsor- 
ing whether it may be easily detached from 
tlie mould, take it from the hain-marit and 
let it stand ; when no more than lukewanBf 
turn it out on your dish.

it H dinipated during the preparation of 
IIr mnm. To preserve then the odour of 
#w capilhnre, when voor sirup is sufficient- 
hr done, pour it^ whiht boiling, upon some 
rah capillaire coarsely chopped up; then 
cover your vessel, and let it Ftand until it 
fe quite cold, then pass it throtish a bolting- 
dodi to separate it from the leaves of the 
capillaire. 

Take .one ounce of the capillaire from 
Canada ; put it into a glazed pan, pour upon 
it fbur*^int8 of boiling watcr^ leave it to in- 
ftne for twdve houre over some warm ashes ; 
strain it and let it run into a vessel, it will 
give you a strong tincture of capillaire; 
melt in tliis tincture four pounds of sugar, 
put the whole into a preserving-pan, and 
pot it on the fire, and clarify ii with the 
white of an egg, continue the cooking; when 
your simp is per/e, put some fresh capil- 
laire, chopped, into a pan, and pour your 
sirup, whilst boiling, upon it; cover your 
pan carefully, and let it cool; when your 
sirup is cold, you may flavor it if you please. 
Put it into bottles, and cork them hermeti- 
cally. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OP. (2) Take 
0ome good capillaire, chop it up, not very 
small, put it upon a sieve; pour upon it 
some boiling water, and then let it infuse 
for ten hours in a vessel well covered ; strain 
this infusion, and put into it some sugar 
boiled au casse; clarify this sirup with the 
whites of eggs whipped; skim it till it is 
very clear ; wlien it rises, fake it off the 
fire, and leave it to cool, then put it into 
bottles. 

Viard and Beauvilliers, whose receipts 
are nearly the same, boil theii- capillaire for 
a quarter of an hour in river- water; after 
having passed this boiling through a sieve, 
they put into it some powder-sugar, and 
clarify their sirup with water, or a whole 
egg beaten up; then skim it, and when it is 
very clear and has boiled au liase^ they 
take it off the fire, and put into it some 
orange-flower water, and strain it tlirough 
a napkin or straining-bag, leaving it to 
cool before putting it into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sirup, vou 
must use two good ounces of capillaire, louv 
pints of water, and four pounds of sugar, 
powder-sugar is the best, as it prevents sir- 
ups from candying. 

CARAMEL. Break into a small copper 
or brass pan one pound of refined sugar; 
put in a gill of spring-water ; set it on a 
fire; when it boils skim it quite clean, and 
let it boil Quick, till it comes to llie degree 
called cracK ; which may be known by dip- 
ping a tea-spoon or skewer into tlie sugar, 
and letting it drop to Uie bottom of a pan 



of cold water; and if it remaina hard, it ham 
attained that degree : squeeze in the juice 
of half a lemon, and let it remain one min- 
ute longer on the fire ; then set tJie pan koto 
another of cold water : have ready mooldi 
of any shape; rub them over with sweet 
oil ; dip a spoon or fork into the sugar, and 
throw It over the mould in fine thi'eada, till 
it is quite covered: make a small handle of 
caramel, or stick on two or three small gam 
paste rings, by way of ornament, and pLoe 
it over small pastry of any description. 

CARAMEL CONSERVE. Clarify the 
quantity of sugar you may require, and boil 
R to caramel; have ready some cases of 
double paper; pour in your sugar to the 
thickness of half an inch, and truce oo its 
surface tlie forms you wish it to have ; when 
cold, break it according to tliose marks. 
This conserve may be colored* aDd flavored 
according to the fancy. 

CARAMEL COVER FOR SWEET- 
MEATS. Dissolve eight ounces of double- 
refined sugar in diree or four spoonfuls <^ 
water, and thi-ee or four drops of lemon- 
juice; then put it into a copper untinoed 
gkillet; when it boils to be thick, dip the 
handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a 
pint basin of water, squeeze tlie sugar fixMn 
tlie spoon into it, and so on till you have aO 
the suj^ar. Take a bit out of tlie water, 
and if it snaps and is brittle when cold, it is 
done enough ; but only let it be tliree parts 
cold, then poar the water from the sugar, 
and having a co|)per mould oiled well, mo 
the sugar on it, in the manner of a maae, 
and when cold you may put it on the dish it 
is to cover ; but if, on trial, tlie sugar is not 
brittle, pour off the water, and return it in- 
to the skillet, and boil it again. It should 
look tliick like treacle, but of a bright light 
gold color. It makes a most elegant cover. 

CARDAMUM COMFITS. Procure 

your cardamums at the chemisUi, and they 
will be in a shell; put tliem into the oven to 
dry the skins, and they will break; pick aO 
the seeds from tliera, put the seeds iota a 
large comfit-pan, and have a fire under die 
same as for others ; mix your gum, starch* 
and sirup, and finish them the same as cara- 
way comfits. 

CARAWAY CAKE. Diy a qoaittr 
of a peck of fine flour in an oven ; rub a 
pound .and a half of fresh butter in it, till it 
is crumbled so small that none of it is to be 
seen ; then take six spoonfuls of rose wafeOi 
half a pint of canarvt half a pint of creatti 
and three-quarters of a pint of new ale yeait, 
an 1 the whites of two, and yolks of linr

fine caraway seeds, sift all the dust from 
tfaem, and have a large copper preserving- 
pan, about two feet wide, and with two 
nandles and two pieces of iron made as a 
ring on each side ; then you must have a 
piliey fixed to the beam, and a cord with a 
hook' to each end, so as to fix it at each 
side of the pan to let it sling; then have 
Bome fine starch as white as you can get, 
and just soften it, boil some sirup a quarter 
of an hour, and mix it with the starch; 
take some gum arabic, put it into some 
water, then put that into anoiiier pan, and 
Boake it just Warm ; have an iron-pot with 
charcoal fire under the large pan, but not 
too hot, only just to keep the fKin warm ; 
have a large tub to put your pot of fire at 
bottom, and your large pan must \ie on the 
top ; put the caraway seeds into your pan ; 
add a large ladleful of gum arabic, mb them 
with your hands until you find they are all 
dty, then put a ladleful of starch and sirup, 
and do the same over ymir pan of fire, until 
you find tliey are all dry ; put the gum only 
three or ibur times to them at first, tlien the 
starch and sugar, but boil your sirup more 
as you find they come to coat with it, and 
not so much starch ; when you have dried 
them seven or eight times, put them into 
your sieve; put them into the stove, do 
them the next day, and so, successively, for 
six. or seven days. 

CARAWAY DRAGEES. Take any 
quantity of'Caraway seeds you think proper,

Grate the rind of a (»drat upon some sugar 
in the usual way, until six ounces of sugar 
have been used ; blanch and pound a pound 
of sweet almonds, moistening them with 
water ; when perfectly smooth, dilute them 
with five glasses of water put in by d^rees ; 
then pour them in a napkin, and squeezing 
it, express the milk of almonds from them; 
divide this into two equal parts, with one 
of which mix the six ounces of sugar widi 
the cedi'at, and with the other portion, mix 
the same quantity of plain sugar ; as soon 
as both are dissolved, strain them, and put 
in each half an ounce of isinglass: yoor 
mould being placed in ice, pour into it the 
white blancmange to three-quarters of an 
inch in depth; as soon as that is set, pour

CHESTNUTS IN CARAMEL. (2) 
Cut some osier rodit or reeds into pieces 
about two or three inches long, and on the 
point of each put a roasted and skinned 
chestnut. Take a piece of very fresh but- 
ter, (about tlie size of a nut), and rob it 
wiUi the palm of the hand, on an iron plate 
or marble slab, taking care to rub every 
part well. Then having boiled some clari- 
fied sugar to caramel height ; take a piece 
of the osier, with a chestnut on the end, in 
each hand, and dip them in the sugar, twist- 
ing them round repeatedly, that the sugar 
may adliere equally about tlie chestnut till 
it begins to cool, then lay them on the but- 
terea slab, and dip in two more, proceed- 
ing as above; when all are done and cold, 
take out the osier twigs, and wrap each 
chestnut in paper, with a device if you

about an ounce of butter. Boil these to- 
gether for some minutes, then strain it, and 
set it by to cool. 

CHESTNUT CUSTARD. Takethiee 
pounds of well roasted chestnuts, removing 
such parts as were colored by the fire, and 
pound them with a ponnd of fresh butt^; 
when a smooth paste, add three-quarters of 
a pound of powder-sugar, the yolks of 
twelve e^s, a pinch of salt, and a few 
spoonfuls uf^ whipped cream, the whites 
whipped firm, and finish the custard as di- 
rected, 

CHESTNUT PASTE. Make a mar- 
malade hf boiling chestnuts in water, and 
rubbing them through a sieve, then pound 
them, and to three-quarters of a pound of 
tliis, add a quarter of a pound of any other 
fruit marmalade ; mix tliem well up with an 
equal weiglit of sugar boiled to grand 
plume; put it into your moulds and bake it 
as cheiTy, or any other paste. 

CHINESE TEMPLE. Havin» boiled 
an ounce of double-refined sugar, with half 
an ounce of butter, and a little water, set it 
by till colrl, ami then add to it an egg wdl 
beaten. With this, make four onnoes of 
flour into a very stiff paste ; roll it out as 
thin ns possible, and lay it in a set of tins 
the form of a temple, and bake them in a 
slow oven. When cold, take die paste 
from the tins, and join each piece togedier 
accordir^ to the proper forms, with isin- 
glass and water. Tlie lower part, of 
course, ought to be stronger than the top, 
in order that it may sustain the weight of 
the whole. The pieces also must oe cut 
as exact as possible to the shape of the 
tins. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. Take a 
pound of chocolate finely grated, and a « 
pound and a half of the best su^ar, finely 
sifted ; soak some gum-dragon in orange* 
flower water, and work them into what 
form you please; the paste must be stiff; 
dry tliem in a stove. You may write de- 
vices on paper, roll them up, and put them 
in the middle. 

CHOCOLATE BONBONS. Put a 
quarter of a pound of chocolajte over a fire, 
to dissolve it; and having boiled two pounds

lines an inch apart all down it $ cross them 
in tike manner, so as to mark the su^r in

you have done ; then pass the sword-blade 
between the marble and the sugar ; lay un- 
der tlie latter sheets of paper ; and when 
cold, break it into pieces according to tlie 
marks, and wrap each square in paper. 

CHOCOLATE COMFITS. Take two 
ounces of chocolate, beat it small with a 
little warm water over tlie fire ; when it is 
dissolved and reduced to a paste, pour it 
upon a pound of nuuse pain or sweet 
paste, to which add some cinnamon or va- 
nilla at discretion ; mix the whole well to- 
gether; then spread it over some wafer 
shapes, and bake it in a moderate ovm. 
If the paste does not appear deep colored 
enough, you may color it with 6o/us Ar- 
menieum, 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (1) Dis- 
solve two ounces of good chocx>late in a 
little water, put it into a skillet with half a 
pound of sugar boiled to perle ; keep tlie 
sugar stirring, and when it boib put tlie 
conserve into moulds. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (2) Dis- 

oolve a quarter of a pound of grated choco- 
late in a small quantity of clarified sugar ; 
boil a pound of sug:ir to the premiere 
piumet put ^'oor chocolate into it, stirring 
it well to mix it; serve it whilst it is warm. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. Take one 
pound and a half of chocolate, put it on a 
pewter sheet or plate, and put it in the 
oven just to warm the chocolate ; then put 
it into a copper stewpan, with three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar; 
mix it well over the lire, take it off, and 
roll it in pieces the size of small marbles, 
put them on white paper, and when they 
are all on, take the sheet of paper by each 
comer, and lift it up and down so that the 
paper may touch the table each time, and 
by tliat means you will see the drops come 
quite fat, about the size of a sixpence; put 
■oroe sugar nonpareils over them, and cover 
alt tliat are on the paper, then shake them 
€ff, and you will see all tlie chocolate dro^w 



are eofered with the sqgar aonpareii; kt 
them stand till cold, and th^ will come otf 
well, and then put them in a box papersd. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (1) 
Take any quanti^ of chocolate, melt it ovtf 
the fire in a small pan ; when m^tod poof 
it into that in which you are to nmke yoar 
ci^eam; break your yolks of e^i into it, 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add some 
pounded loaf sug^tr to it, keep stirrine ooa- 
tinually ; then add your cream by littfe and 
little, stirring and turning it till the whole 
is mixed properly togedier; then aei your 
pan over the fire, and keep stirring with a 
wooden spoon till you see your composition 
is near boiling, tlien take it off iramedtaite- 
ly, for, from the moment you set your coB- 
position over the fire till that it ofiers to 
ooil, it lias sufficient time to incorporate 
well and tliicken sufficiently, without need 
of boiling ; and should you let it boil, yoa 
would risk the turning your cream into 
whev, on account of the yolks of eggs, which 
would do too much. Take great caie 
likewise your cream is fresh and sweet, 
for otherwise as soon as it is warm it will 
turn to curds and whey ; therefore, be care- 
ful, stir it continually, from the time yoa 
set it on the fire till you take it off; then 
put it in the sabotiere to make it ooi^geai 
afler tlie usual manner. ^ 

CHO(X)LATE ICE CREAM. (4) 

Dissolve the chocohite in a little water oo 
a slow fire; when properly done, mix it 
widi a pint of cream, three yolks of new 
laid eggs, and about half a pound ofsi^gar.

plate over a coal fire, and when it is dis- 
solved pour it on a plate ; put to it a spoon. 
fill or two of sweet almona paste, naade as 
for macaroons, stir it Jn well, and tlien pour 
it upon the remainder of the almond paste, 
in which you have mixed a tea-spoonful of 
powdered cinnamon or vanilla, or both: 
beat them together well in a mmtar, Isy 
them on paper, and bake them for three- 
quartera of an hour in a moderate oven. • 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT AMOUR. 
For four bottles of brandy, take one pomd 
of the best chocolate, cut in small bit*; a 
little salt, two cloves, and a little cinna* 
men ; you must infuse all in the Ijrandy, witi 
two bottles and half a pint of water, with

wkHn of cfgB, and filter it through the pa- 
|ier. YoQ mupt be careful not to take moi'e 
timD two botties fit>in every four, except 
firom the cinnamon, froin which you are to 
take as much as you can get. 

CHOCOLATE PASTILS. Take a 
little chocolate, which put in a pan over the 
fire to melt it ; 8tir it with a spoon ; when 
k is melted, take half a pound of loaf m- 

SEir, pounded in a mortar and nified, which 
isBOive in a little clear water. When that 
IB d<Hie, put in your chocolate ; if you find 
the paste too thick, add a little watm*, 
enougti to bring it to that degree of liquidity 
that you may take it up on a knife ; tlien 
take half a sheet of pnper, and cover it with 
little roimd Rnd flat drops, which we call 
paaHiay of the size of a sixpence ; let tliem 
diT naturally in a cupboard; and when dry, 
take them off from the paper, and put tbeiu 
in boxes. 

CHOCOLATE PASTIL PASTE. 

Melt half an ounce of gum-dragon in a little 
water till it is quite dissolved and thick; 
sift it through a linen cloth, pound it in a 
mortar with a quarter-part of whites of 
^gs, a chocolate cake bruised, and half a 
pound of fine powder-sugar, mixed by de- 
grees, and adding either more or less sugar, 
according as the paste is malleable ; it must 
be pretty firm ; form it into what flowers or 
designs you please, as shells, lozenges, any 
kind of corn or beans, &c. 

CHOCOLATE PETIT PAINS. These 
are made in tlie same way as PetiU Pains 
a la Duchesse (see that article), but with- 
out the dorure. When cold fill them with 
a cream paiitnere, mixed witli two ounces 
of vanilla chocolate, and sweetened with 
sugar, flavored with vanilla ; then put three 
ounces of sifted sugar, the same of choco- 
late, and half the white of an e^ into a 
pan; stir these ingredients with a silver 
spoon until you have a smooth transparent 
glaze, with which mask the top and sides 
of the petits pains, spreading it equally 
with the blade of a knife. 

CpOCOLATE SWEETMEATS. 
Take two ounces of chocolate, and break it 
bito a little warm water, put it on the fire, 
and when quite dissolved, mix it with a 
pound of marchpane paste, to which may be 
added vanilla or cinnamon ; stir it op well, 
and then spread it on wafer-paiier in what 
Ibrfds yon please, and bake them in a mod- 
erate oven. If the sweetmeats be not suffi»> 
ciently dark colpred,, add a little boliQkmmo- 
Diae. 

CINNAMON OAVUSa. Whiik ^ 



half a doKB eggs with three tabkHfrpnonMi 
of rose water; add to it a pound of sifted 
sugar, a dessert-spoonful of powdered cinna- 
mon, and a sufficient qoanlit}' of flour to 
, make it into a paste ; roll it out thin, and 
cut it into whatever forms your fimcy may 
dictate, place them on paper, and bake 
them. When done, remove them from the 
paper. Keep tliem dry. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (1) Soak cin- 
namon in water for four and twenty hours, 
and then cut it into pieces about an inch 
k>ng ; pi-epere some sugar to grand liss^, 
and give the cinnamon a boil in it; drain 
and dry it in a stove to the proper consis- 
tence ; tlien put it in the moulds with sugar 
boiled to smtffU, and when half cold, dry 
it. Before the candy is removed from the 
moulds, they should be laid on one side for 
some time. Keep them in paper in a dry 
place. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (2) Cut 
some cinnamon into small sticks of about an 
inch or an inch and a half long; tliep put 
them into thin sugar, and boil iliem as it 
were in a sirup. Then take off the pan, 
and set it by for five or six hours to soak, 
take them out and lay them on a wire-grate, 
dry tliem tlioroughly in the stove; after- 
wards put them in order in tin moukls 
upon little grates made for the purpose, and 
set into the moulds, so that there may be 
tliree rows set one above another, separated 
by those grates. In the meantime, boil su- 
gar till it is hlovm, and pour it into your 
mould, so that some of it may lie upon the 
uppermost grate ; then set them in die stove 
with a covered fire, and let them stand all 
night ; the next morning take notice whether 
tlie cinnamon be well coagulated ; turn the 
mould upside down, and set it in the stove 
again, with a plate underneath ; and when it 
is thoroughly drained, take out your sticks 
of cinnamon, loosening them, \^ little and 
little, gently; then lay them upon a sieve, 
set in the stove, and dry tliem thoroughly. 

CINNAMON, CONSERVE OF. 
Bruise four drachms of cinnamon, dilute it 
with a little clarified sugar, or sirup of mal- 
lows; boil two pounds of sugar to peti^ 
cass^i tlirow in the cinnamon, stir it well,, 
and then take it from the fire, and when the 
sugar begins to whiten, pour the conserve 
into cases or moulds, and. dry it as teaal. 

CINNAMON, DRAGEES OR SU- 
GARED. Soak a quarter of a pound of 
the best cinnamon in sticks, for twelve houm 
in water to soften it ; at the end of that tiiae^ 
cut it into slips, by them on a sieve in a 
warui p^jce ^r some da^. Whqa qiiifii

Manner aa in doing Almond J)ragee», 
until the cinnamon slicks are of the proper 
ihickneea; those which are to be twisted or 
curled, sboukl not be so thick as the others. 
Be equally particular in removing the sugar, 
that cakes on the bottom of the pan, as in 
making Almond Dragees. 

CINNAMON DRAGEES, COMMON. 
Infuse a quarter of a pound of gum-dragon, 
in as much water as will cover it; the next 
day put the ii^fusion into a mortar, and stir 
it well with a pestle, and the longer it is 
stiired the whiter it becomes; in rather 
more tlian a quarter of un hour, add to it 
the caked sugar which was removed from 
the preserving'pan, and which must be well 
pounded and sifted, also a pound of powder- 
sugar, a spoonful of cinnamon ^mwder, and 
tiy degrees two or three pounds of flour; 
moisten the whole occasionally with water ; 
when the paste is of a proper consistence, 
place it on the slab or pasteboard, knead it 
well fur a short time, roll it out in sheets, 
Dot thicker tlian the eighth of an inch, and 
then cut it into slips of the same size as the 
(Cinnamon (see above,) put them on paper 
'or a s^ieve in a warm place for some days. 
Then boil some eonnnon sugar to perle, 
■and sugar the slips of paKte as above direct- 
•ed ; instead of the fine powder, flour is suffi- 
■cient, until the last two layers, when tlie 
powd^ may be used to give them whiteness. 
\Vhen of tlie requisite size, lay them on 
Aleves to dry. In a few days there may be 
curled, and colored, which is done in the 
•ame manner as coriander seeds. Observe, 
fine sugared cinnamon is always white. 

CINNAMON, ESSENCE OF. This 
is made by infusing oil of cinnamon in 
Jhi^ly rectified spirits of wine, in the pro- 
portion of half a drachm of the former to an 
ounce of the latter. 

CINNAMON PASTILS. Dissolve 
half an ounce of gum-dragon in a glass of 
water, and strain it through a lawn sieve 
into a mortar, and add to it a tea-spoonful 
jOf powdered ciQDaBK>a, and a sufficient 
quantity of sifled sugar to make the paste of 
« proper consistence; form into such figures 
•8 you may fancy, and dry them in a stove. 
Keep them in a dry place. 

CINNAMON SWEETMEATS. Take 
A pound of marchpane paste* and dilute 
It with as many whites of eggs as will 
m»ke it spread eaeily with aJiuife; add to 
Ibis, a spoonful or two <^ prepai'ed lfole*am-

oit some wafer-paper into such forma aa ym 
may think proper, and lay on thera the paalr 
about the thickness of the eiehth of an iochi 
place them on paper, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. When dime, they may be 
finished in the Iblluwing manner :-^JBoil 
some sugar in orange-flower water, to la 
plume, and as you take the sweetmeats from 
the oven ; dip a hair-pencil into the sinxp^ 
and brush them over ; this dries almost im- 
mediately, and considerably improves the 
look of them. 

CINNAMON WAFERS. Pound and 
sift six ounces of sugar, and put it with an 
equal quantity of melted fresh butter, the 
same of flour, half an ounce of powdered 
cinnamon, and a small egg; stir tliese up in 
an earthenware vessel, with a sufficient 
quantity of milk to make it into a tliin, but 
not too clear, paste. Make an iron plate 
quite hut, rub it well with butter, then lay 
on it a spoonful of the paste; fry U, and 
when brown on both sides, roll it, sliU over 
the hot iron, round a small stick; do this 
until all tlie paste is used. 

CINNAMONUM. Take a quarter of 
a pound of cinnamon, two draclims of mace^ 
and one ounce of stick-liquorice; bruise 
them well, and then put them into threo 
quarts of the best brandy ; let the infusion 
stand fur some .days before you distil it; 
dissolve four pounds of sugar m three pints 
and a half of water ; mix this sirup with the 
liqueur, and then strain them. This is 
sometimes called Oil of Cinnamon. 

CITRON , CAN DIED. Pare the citrons 
very thin and narrow, and throw them into 
water; these are called faggots; then cut 
the citron into slices of any tliickness you 
think proper ; take out tlie inner part with 
great care, so as to leave only the white 
ring, and put thein with tlie faggots into 
boiling water; when tender, drain them* 
Boil a sufficient quantity of clarified sugar 
to souffle; then put in the rings« and boil 
them together. Take it from the fire, and 
when a little cool, rub tl>e sugar against the 
side of tlie pre.^erving-pan with the back of 
a spoon; as soon as it becomes white, tako 
out the rings with a fork very carefully, ono 
by one, and lay them on a wire-grate to 
drain: boil and proceed with the faggots in 
a similar. way; when taken out, cut them 
into prqpe^ lengths with a pair of scissors, 
and lay tliem also on the wire to draiou 

CITRON PASTE. Cut off the ewb 
of the citrons, take out the middle, with aS 
the s^eds; boil th(»iii n^ aoffofi watmr^ jisd

everv quarter of a pound of this marmalade 
put naif a pound of clarified sugar; simmer 
them together, stirring constantly until well 
nixed ; then put them mto moulds, and place 
ihem in a stove to dry. 

CITRON WHITE PRESERVED. 
Lay some white citrons, cut into pieces, in 
salt and water for four or five hours; then, 
having wasiied them in cold water, boil 
them; when tender, drain, and lay them 
into as much clarified sugar as wilt cover 
them. Tlie next day drain off the simp, 
and boil it; when quite smooth and cold, 
pour It on the ci Irons; let them stand twen- 
ty-four hours; tlien boil the sirup again, 
and put in the citrons. The third day, 
boil both together, and put them into moulds 
to candy. 

CITRON PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Cut a slit in the sides of some small citrons, 
so that the inside may take the sugar as 
well as the outside, and put them over the 
jfii'e in some water; whenever they are near 
boiling, put cold water to them. As soon 
as the citrons rise to the top, take them out, 
and throw them into cold water. They 
inust then be pnt on the lire again, in tlie 
eame water, and boiled gently until tender; 
then take them out, and pot them in cold 
-water. After this, boil them seven or eight 
times in clarified sugar; pour the whole 
' into en earthen pan, and let it stand. The 
next day drain the frait, and boil up the 
sirup twenty or thirty times; add a little 
more sugar, and pour it over the citrons; 
do this- for three successive days, increasing 
Hie degree to which you boil the sugar daily, 
so that at the last boiling the degree may 
be au perle. The fruit may then be put 
hato pots. 

To preserve them dry, they must be done 
exactly the same; only, instead of putting 
the fruit into pots, they should be dried on 
sieves in a stove. With the remaining su- 
gar the citrons may be glazed. 

CITRON RATAFIA. Pare seven or 
eight citrons very thin ; cut the peel into 
small pieces, and put them into a jar, with 
three pints of brandy, and let them infuse 
fi>r three weeks ; then add to this a pound 
of sugar, boiled in half a pint of water, and 
well skimmed; let it stand twelve or fifteen 
days longer, Ivhen it may be bottled. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (1) Put into 
9 china bowl alternate layers of fine powder- 
sugar, and citron, pared, and cut in very 



thin slices, and let them stand till the next 
day; then stram off the sirup, and clarify U 
over a gentle fire. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (2) Put die 
rinds of three citix>n8 into an earthen ves- 
sel, and strain on them the juice; to this 
put a little water; poor the mixture into a 
basin in which is four pounds of clarified 
sugar, boiled to fort houlet. Place this 
basin in a large saucepan, half filled with 
water, over the fire ; stir the contents of 
the basin frequently; and wlien the sugar is 
entirely dissolved, and the sirup quite clear, 
take the saucepan from tlie fire, and let it 
cool. As soon as it is cold it may be bot- 
tled. 

CITRONNELLE RATAFIA. For 

two quarts of the best brandy, take the 
zesies or rinds of a- dozen fine sound lem- 
ons, two drachms of bruised cinnamon, an 
ounce of coriander, and two pounds of su- 
^r, dissolved in a pint and a half of water; 
mfiise the whole for a month, then strain 
and bottle it. 

CLOVES, OIL OF. This is made in 
the same manner as cinnamonum ; the quanti- 
ties are, an ounce of cloves to three quarts 
of brandy, and four pounds of sugar dis- 
solved in four pints of water. 

CLOVE PASTILS. Are made like 
thoFe of cinnamon. The proportions are 
six cloves to half an ounce of gum-dragon. 

CLOVES, SIRUP OF. Put a quarter 
of a pound of cloves, and a quart of boiling 
water into a stewpan, coN^er it close, and 
boil them gently for half an honr; drain the 
cloves, and to a pint of the liquor put two 
pounds of sugar ; beat up two eggs in a little 
cold water, add them to the above, and sim- 
mer the whole I ill it becomes a strong sirup. 
When cold, bottle it. 

COFFEE BONBONS. Take about a 
pint of coffee made wiUi water; put in it a 
pound of loaf-sugar; set it on tlie fire and 
txtil it to a high degree ; then add a full pint 
of double cream, and let it l)oil again, keep- 
ing continually stirring till it comes to cara- 
mel hei^t; to know when it is come to 
that point, you must have a basin of water 
by you ; dip your finger in it, and put it 
quickly in your sugar, then in the water 
again, to remove the sugar, which will have 
stuck to it ; take a bit of it in your teeth ; 
if it is hard in its crackling, take it off, it 
is sufficiently done; pour it upon a tin plate, 
which must be rubbed before with a little 
butter, or it will stick to the plate; then 
spread it with a rolling pin ; (observe, the 



CQN 



276 



CRE 



roRing pin must likewise be rubbed widt 
TlMitter, tor fear it should stick;) when it is 
warm, you may cut it into little squares, lo- 
zenges, or any other shaped pastilles, and 
draw a few strokes over them with a knife. 

COFFEE CONSERVES. Clarify and 
boll to the first degree a pound of sugar; 
take the sugar off the fire, and put into it 
one cup of coffee ; stir it al)out until it comes 
to the sixth degree, that the conserve may 
take the sugar and diy. 

COFFEE EGGS. Make some good 
strong coffee ; let it rest to clear as usual, 
and sweeten it with sugar according to dis- 
cretion; beat up six yolks of eggs, witji 
about four cups of coffee, and sift it; pour 
idih into little moulds in the form of eggs, or 
of any other, (do not fill tliem quite,) and 
bake in a mild oven, or a Dutch one, or 
"with a brazing-pan; cover between two 
fires. They are made after this manner, in 
Hie shape of any fruits or birds, if you have 
proper moulds, either of copper or china, 
&c. 

COLTSFOOT, SIRUP OF. Take of 
coltsfoot six ounces, maidenliair two ounces, 
hyssop one ounce, liquorice-root one ounce; 
boil them in two quarts of spring water till 
one fiiurth is consumed ; then strain it, and 
put to the liquor two pounds of fine powder- 
sag-Ar; clarify it with the whites of eggs, 
and boil it till it is nearly as thick as 
honey. 

CONSERVES, DRIED. For all Ports 
of conserves, the sugar should be prepared 
to the ninth degree, according to the quan- 
tity wanted ; they are all made much after 
the same manner, the only difference being 
ID the quantity of fruits proposed. Con- 
serves are made with all sorts of sweetmeat 
marmalade, sifted in a sieve, and soaked 
pretty dry over a slow fire ; use about half 
a pound of the sugar thus prepared, to a 
quarter of a pound of sweetmeat marmalade; 
take the sugar off the fire to work them 
well together; warm the whole for a mo- 
ment, and pour it into paper cases made for 
, the purpose; when it is cool it may be cut 
into cakes of what size you please. 

CONSERVE OF FOUR FRUITS. 

Take strawberries, currants, cherries, and 
raspberries, of each a quarter of a pound, 
and three pounds of sugar. Bruise your 
fruit, and having strained off the juice, put 
it in a saucepan over a gentle fire, stirring 
it till reduced to half. Dissolve the sugar, 
skim, and boil it to casses take it from the 
fire while you put in the juice, then put it 
OD again, and give it one boil, take it off. 



and keep stirring till the siunr babbles, 
the conserve may be poured into iDoulds. 

CONSERVES, HARD IN MOULDS. 

These are made in the same naanner as 
other conserves, except that diey are com- 
posed of sugar, and distilled aromatic wai- 
ter ; and may be colored like pastils. 

CORIANDER DRAGEES. Take any 

quantity of coriander seeds, put them in the 
tossing-pan over tlie fire, aud let them warm; 
when they are warm throw in about half a 
glass of vinegar, stir them well till they are 
dry ; have clarified sugar, which boil in an- 
-other pan; then when the corianders are 
dry, add a little gum to them, and do the 
same again till they are dry, and continoe 
so doing till you see the corianders are cov- 
ered to the size you want to have them; 
when that is done, take the corianders out 
from the pan, wash them well, and put them 
in again, and stir them well till they are all 
warm ; then take your clarified sugar, which 
you have previously boiled to the first de« 
gree; when this is done, put it in an instru- 
ment of copper, made on pm*pose for the 
operation, and at the bottom of which there 
is a little hole; hang it up by a packthread 
string, that the sugar may fall from about a 
yard height into the pan where tiie corian- 
ders are ; while the st^ar falls into your pan 
keep stirring well your dragees till you see 
they are well pearled over, or roi^ and 
grainy ; when they are sufficiently so, take 
them out, and place them in the stove to 
finish drying. 

CORIANDER SUGARED. These

the preparation into a mould lighdy buttered 
within side. Put this mould into a large 
saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of boil- 
ing water to reach within an inch of the 
mould; place the saucepan on hot adies* 
cover it, and place hot coals on the lid; 
renew the fire underneath occasionally, so 
as to keep tlie water at the same tempera- 
ture, that is, nearly, but never quite, boil- 
ing for an hour and a half; then, if the 
cream is properly set, which may be known 
by touching it with your finger, and observ- 
ing whether it may be easily detached fixm 
the mould, take it from the bain-marie and 
let it stand; when no more than iukewana, 
turn it out on your dish.

W done, pour it, whihc boiling, upon stHoe 
mh eapiUure ooandy diopped up; then 
cover your vessd, and let it Ftand until it 
is qoite ooM, then pass it through a boking- 
cklb to separate it from the feaves of the 
capi Haire. 

Take one ounce of the capilhire from 
Canada; put it into a glazed pan, poor upon 
it Ibuf^ints of boiling watcr^ leare it to in- 
fese ibr twdre hours over some warm ashes ; 
strain it and let it run into a vessel, it will 
give you a strong tincture of capillaire; 
mek in this tincture four pounds of sugar, 
put the whole into a preser%'ing.pan, and 
put it on tlie fire, and clarify ii with the 
white of an egg, continue the cooking ; when 
your sirup is perUy put some fresh capil- 
uiire, chopped, into a pan, and pour your 
sirup, whilst boiling, upon it; cover yotir 
pan CHrefiillV) and let it cool; when your 
simp is cold, you may flavor it if you please. 
Put it into bottles, and cork them heiTneti- 
cally. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OF. (2) Take 
0ome good capillaire, chop it up, not very 
small, put it upon a sieve; pour upon it 
some boiling water, and then let it infuse 
for ten hours in a vessel well covered ; strain 
this infusion, and put into it some sugar 
boiled au ceuse; clarify tliis sirup with tlie 
whites of eggs whipped; skim it till it is 
Tery clear ; when it rises, take it off the 
fire, and leave it to cool, then put it into 
Imttles. 

Viard and Beauvilliers, whose receipts 
are nearly the same, boil their capillaire for 
a quaiter of an hour in river- water; after 
having passed this boiling througli a sieve, 
they put into it some |x>wder-6ugar, and 
clarify their simp with water, or a whole 
e^ beaten up; then skim it, and when it is 
very clear and has boiled au lisBe, they 
take it off the fire, and put into it some 
orange-flower water, and strain it through 
a napkin or straining-bag, leaving it to 
cool before putting it into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sirup, yon 
must use two good ounces of capillaire, k)ur 
pmts of water, and foui* pounds of sugar, 
powder-sugar is the best, as it prevents sir- 
ups from candying.

or brass pan one pound of refined sugar ; 
put in a gill of sprina;-water ; set it on a 
fire; when it boils skira it quite clean, and

called crack ; which may be known by dip- 
piuff a tea-spoon ac skewer into tlie sugar, 
and letting it drop to the bottom of a pan 



of cold water; and if it remainB bard, it Inv 
attained that degree : squeeze in the jmce 
of half a lemon, and let it remain one min- 
ute longer on the fire ; then set tlie pan into 
another of cold water : have ready moulds 
of any diape; rub them over with sweet 
oil ; dip a spoon or fork into the sugar, and 
throw it over the mould in fine threads, tiB 
it is quite covered: make a small handle of 
caramel, or stick on two or three small gmn 
paste rings, by way of ornament, and {race 
it over small pastry of any description. 

CARAMEL CONSERVE. Clarify the 
quantity of sugar you may require, and boil 
R to caramel; have ready some cases of 
double paper; pour in your sugar to the 
thickness of half an inch, and truce on ito 
surface tlie forms you wish it to have ; wfaoi 
cold, break it according to diose marks. 
This conserve may be coTnned^aDd fiavored 
according to the foocy. 

CARAMEL COVER FOR SWEET- 
MEATS. Dissolve eight ounces of double- 
refined sugar in three or four spoonfuls of 
water, and three or four drops of lemon- 
juice; then put it into a copper untinned 
i^kiliet; when it boils to be thick, dip the 
handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a 
pint basin of water, squeeze tlie st^r from 
tlie spoon into it, and so on till you fiave all 
the sugai-. Take a bit out of the water, 
and if it snafts and is brittle wlien cold, it is 
done enougl) ; but only let it be three parts 
cold, then poar the water from the sugar, 
and having a copper mould oiled well, run 
Uie sugar on it, in the manner of a maae, 
and wlien cold you may put it on the dish it 
is to cover ; but if, on trial, the sugar is not 
brittle, pour off the water, and return it in- 
to tl)e skillet, and boil it again. It should 
look tliick like treacle, but of a bright light 
gold cok>r. It makes a most elegant cover. 

CARDAMUM COMFITS. Procure 

your cardamums at the cliemists, and they 
will be in a shell; put them into the oven to

and do the same over your pan of fire, until 
you find they are all dry ; put the gum only 
three or four times to them at first, tlien the 
starch and <*ugar, but boil your sirup more 
aa you find they come to coat with it, and 
not so much starch ; when you have dried 
tliem seven or eight times, put them into 
your sieve; put them into the stove, do 
tfaem die next day, and so, successively, for 
six or seven days.

in the usual way, until six ounces of sugar 
have been used ; blanch and pound a pound 
of sweet almonds, moistening them with 
water ; when perfectly smooth, dilute them 
with five glasses of water put in by d^rees ; 
then pour them in a napkin, and squeezir^

rubbing them through a sieve, then poond 
them, and to three-quarters of a pound of 
this, add a quarter of a pound of any other 
fruit marmalade ; mix tliem well up with an 
equal weiglit of si^r boiled to grand 
plume; put it into your moulds and bake it 
as cherry, or any other paste. 

CHINESE TEMPLE. Having boiled 
an ounce of double-refined sugar, with half 
an ounce of butter, and a little water, set it 
by till colrl, and then add to it an egg well 
beaten. With tliis, make four ounces of 
flour into a very stiff paste ; roll it out as 
thin ns po^ible, and lay it in a set of tins 
the form of a temple, and bake them in a 
slow oven. When cold, take the paste 
from the tins, and join each piece together 
accoi-dii^ to the proper forms, with isin- 
glass and water. Tbe lower part, of 
course, ought to be strong than the top, 
in order that it may sustain the weight of 
the whole. The pieces also must be cut 
as exact as possible to the shape of the 
tind. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. Take a 
pound of chocolate finely grated, and a « 
pound and a half of the best su^ar, finely 
sifted ; soak some gum-dragon in oransO' 
flower water, and work them into what 
form you please ; the paste must be stiff; 
dry them in a stove. You may write de- 
vices on paper, roll them up, and put them 
in the middle. 

CHOCOLATE BONBONS. Put a 
quarter of a pound of chocolajte over a fire, 
to dissolve it; and having boiled two pounds

marble slab or table : on this pour the choco- 
late and sugar ; then take two ends of a 
flword-blade, (one in each hand), and press 
lines an inch apart all down it ; cross them 
in like manner, so as to mark the su^^r in 
small squares aU over ; doing it as quick as

vou have done ; then pass the sword-blade 
between the marble and the sugar ; lay un- 
der the latter sheets of paper ; and when 
cold, break it into pieces according to tlie 
marks, and wrap each square in paper. 

CHOCOLATE COMFITS. Take two 
ounces of chocolate, beat it small with a 
little warm water over the fire ; when it is 
dissolved and reduced to a paste, pour it 
«pon a pound of masse pain or sweet 
paste, to which add some cinnamon or va- 
nilla at discretion; mix the whole well to- 
gether; then spread it over some wafer 
shapes, and bake it in a moderate oven. 
If the paste does not appear deep colored 
enough, you may color it with bolus Ar- 
fnenieufn. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (1) Dis- 
solve two ounces of good chocolate in a 
little wat^, put it into a skillet with half a 
pound of sugar boiled to perle ; keep the 
sugar stirrii^, and when it boils put tlie 
conserve into moulds. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (2) Dis- 
solve a quarter of a pound of grated choco- 
late in a small quantity of clarified sugar ; 
boil a pound of sug»r to the premiere 
plumey put your chocolate into it, stirring 
it well to mix it; serve it whilst it is warm. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. Take one 
pound and a half of chocolate, put it on a 
pewter sheet or plate, and put it in the 
oven just to warm the chocolate ; then put 
it into a copper stewpaoj with three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar; 
mix it well ov&r the fire, take it off, and 
roll it in pieces the size of small marbles, 
put them on while paper, and when they | 
are all on, take the sheet of paper by each ' 
corner, and lift it up and down so that the 
paper may touch the table each time, and 
Dy tliat means you will see the drops come 
quite fat, about the size of a sixpence ; put 
some sugar nonpareils over them, and cover 
aH that are on the paper, then shake them 
off, and you will see all the chocolate drops 



are covered with the sqgar BODpareli; kt 

them stand till cold, and they will cone atBt 
well, and then pat them in a box papereit 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (1) 
Take any quantity of chocolate, melt it ofcf 
the fire in a small pan ; when melted poof 
it into that in which you are to make yoof 
ci^eam; break your yolks of eggs into it^ 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add sobk 
pounded loaf sugar to it> keep stirring ooa- 
tinually ; then add your cream l^ little and 
little, stirring and turning it till the whole 
is mixed properly together; then set vonr 
pan over the fire, and keep stirring with a 
woodm spoon till you see your compositioD 
is near boiling, tlien take it off immediate- 
ly, for, from the moment you set your coot- 
position over the fire till that it offers to 
boil, it lias sufficient time to incorporate 
well and thicken sufiiciently, without oeed 
of boiling; and should you let it boil, yea 
would risk the turning your cream into 
whey, on account of tlie yolks of eggs, whidi 
would do too much. Take great care 
likewise your cream is fresh and sweet, 
for otherwise as soon as it is warm it will 
turn to curds and whey ; therefore, be care- 
ful, stir it continually, frcHn the time yoo 
set it on the fire till you take it off; then 
put it in the sabotiere to make it congeal 
after tlie usual manner. ^ 

CHO(X)LATE ICE CREAM. (2> 
Dissolve the chocolate in a little water on 
a slow fire; when properly done, mix it 
with a pint of cream, tiiree yolks of new 
laid eggs, and about half a pound of sqgar.

beat them together well in a mortar, htf 
them on paper, and bake them for tfara^ 
quarters of an hour in a moderate oveo. • 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT AMOUR. 

For four bottles of brandy, take one pound

CHOCOLATE PASTILS. Take a 
little cbo(M>bite, which put in a pan over the 
fire to melt it ; stir it with a spoon ; when 
it ifl melted, take half a pound of loaf mi- 
gar, pounded in a mortar and silted, which 
aiasolve in a little clear water. When that 
k done, put in your chocolate; if you find 
die paste too thick, add a little water,

mortar with a quarter-part of whites of 
eggs, a chocolate cake bruised, and half a 
pound of fine powder-sugar, mixed by de- 
grees, and adding either more or less sugar, 
according' as the paste is malleable ; it must 
be pretty firm ; form it into what flowers or 
designs you please, as shells, lozenges, any 
kind of corn or beans, &c. 

CHOCOLATE PETIT PAINS. These 
aie made in die same way as PetiU Paina 
a la Duchesse (see that article), but with- 
out the dorure. When cold fill th«m with 
a cream patisaiere, mixed witli two ounces

and give the cinnamon a boil in it; drain 
and dry it in a stove to the proper consis- 
tence; tlien put it in the moiikls with sugar 
boiled to aauffU, and when half cold, dry 
it. Before the candv is removed from the 
moulds, they should be laid on one side for 
some time. Keep them in paper in a diy 
place. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (2) Cot 
some cinnamon into small sticks of about tm 
inch or an inch and a half long; tlien pot 
them into thin sugar, and boil them as it 
were in a sirup. Then take ofl^ the pan, 
and set it by fur five or six hours to soak, 
take them out and lay tliem on a wire-grate, 
dry diem thoroughly in the stove; after- 
wards put diem ill order in tin moulds 
upon little grates made for the purpose, and 
set into the moulds, so that there may be 
three rows set one almve another, separated 
by those grates. In the meantime, boil su- 
gar till it is blown, and pour it into your 
mould, so that some of it may lie upon the 
uppermost grate ; then set them in die stove 
with a covered fire, and let them stand all 
night ; tlie next morning take notice whether 
the cinnamon be well coagulated ; turn the 
mould upside down, and set it in the stove 
again, with a plate underneath; and when it 
is thoroughly drained, take out your sticks 
of cinnamon, loosening ihem, by little and 
litde, gently ; then lay tliem upon a sieve, 
set in the stove, and dry them thoroughly. 

CINNAMON, CONSERVE OP.

CINNAMON DRAGEES, CX)MMON. 
Infuse a quarter of a pound of gum-dragon, 
in as much water as will cover it; the next 
day put the infusion into a mortar, and stir 
it well with a pestle, and the longer it is 
stirred the whiter it becomes; in ratlier 
more tlian a quarter of ao hour, add to it 
the caked sugar which was removed from 
the preserving-pan, and which must be well 
pounded and sifted, also a pound of powder- 
sugar, a spoonful of cinnamon powder, and 
by degrees two or three pounds of flour; 
moisten the whole occasionally with water ; 
when tlie paste is of a proper consistence, 
place it on the slab or pasteboard, knead it 
well for a short time, roll it out in sheets, 
not thicker tlian tlie eighth of an inch, and 
then cut it into slips of the same size as the 
cinnamon (see above,) put tliem on paper 
or a neve in a warm place for some days. 
Then boil some eonjmon sugar to perle, 
■and sugar the sliiis of paste as above direct- 
•ed ; instead of the 6ne powder, flour is suffi- 
cient, until the last two layera, when tlie 
powder may be used to give them whiteness. 
When of die requisite size, lay them <m 
sieves to dry. In a few days there may be

tame manner as coriander seeds. Observe, 
fine sugared cinnamon is always white. 

CINNAMON. ESSENCE OF. This 
k made by infusing oil of cinnamon in 
highly rectified spirits of wine, in the pro- 
portion of half a drachm of the former to an 
ounce of the latter. 

CINNAMON PASTILS. Dissolve 
half an ounce of gum-dragon in a glass of 
water, and strain it through a lawn sieve 
into a inoitar, and add to it a tea-spoonful 
jOf powdered cianaBK>n, and a sufficient 
qoaatily of sifted sugar to make the paste of 
A proper coasistencet form into such figures 
M you may fancy, and dry tliem in a stove. 
Keep them in a dry place.

finished in tiie following manoer: — ^Boil 
some sugar in oranfio-flower water, to la 
plume, and as you talte the sweetmeats fn» 
the oven; dip a hair-pencil into the sirup, 
and brush them over ; this dries almost im- 
mediately, and considerably improves the 
look of them. 

CINNAMON WAFERS. Pound and 
sift six ounces of sugar, and put it with an 
equal quantity of melted fresh butter, the 
same of flour, lialf an ounce of powdered 
cinnamon, and a small egg; stir these up in 
an earthenware vessel, with a siifficieitf 
quantity of milk to make it into a tliin, but 
not too clear, paste. Make an iron plate 
quite hot, rub it well with butter, then lay 
on it a spoonful of the paste; fry U, and 
when brown on both sides, roll it, still over 
the hot iron, round a small itick; do this 
until all the paste is used. 

CINNAMON UM. Take a quarter of 
a pound of cinnamon, two dradinis of inace, 
and one ounce of stick-liquorice; bruise 
tliem well, and then put them into three 
quarts of the best brandy ; let the infusion 
stand for some .days befui« you distil it; 
dissolve four pounds of sugar in three pints 
and a half of water; mix this sirup with the 
liqueur, and tlien strain them. This ut 
sometimes culled Oil of CLnnauion. 

CITRON, CANDIED. Pare the citrous 
very thiu and narrow, and tlirow them into 
water; these are called faggots; then cut 
the citi*on into slices of any thickness yoi| 
think proper; take out the inner ytart with 
great care, so as to leave only the white 
ring, and put them \vilh die faggots into 
boiling water; when tender, dram them. 
Boil a sufficient quantity of clarified sugac 
to souffle; then put in the rinss, and boil 
them together. Take it from the fire, and 
when a Ihtle cool, rub tlie sugar against the 
side of tlie pre.<erving>pan with the back of 
a spoon; as soon as it becomes white, take 
out the rings with a fork very carefully, one 
by one, and lay them on a wire-grate (0 
drain : boil and proceed with the fiiggots ie 
a similar way; when taken out, cut them 
into propel* lengths with a pair of scit 
and lay tliem also on the wire to dnUo. 

CITRON PASTE. Cut off the ends 
of the citrons, take out the middle, with afl 
the B^oda; boil thpm m eppoe welvri . md

wlien quite tender, take them from the fire, 
and throw them into cold water a moment ; 
liien,- having pressed them in a olotb to get 
the water out, pound and sift them. To 
6verT quarter of a pound of this marmalade 
put naif a pound of clRrified sugar; simmer 
them together, stirring constantly until well 
mixed ; then put them into moulds, and place 
^m in a stove to dry. 

CITRON WHITE PRESERVED. 
Lay some white citrons, cut into pieces, in 
salt and water for four or five hours; then, 
having waslied them in cold water, boil 
them; when tender, drain, and lay them 
into as much clarified sugar as will cover 
them. The next day drain off the simp, 
and boil it; when quite smooth and cold, 
pour It on the citrons; let them stand twen- 
ty-four houre; then boil the sirup again, 
and put in the citrons. The tliird day, 
boil both together, and put them into moulds 
to candy. 

CITRON PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Cut a slit in the sides of some small citrons, 
so that the inside may take the sugar as 
well as the outside, and put them over the 
fire in some water; whenever they are near 
boiling, put cold water to them. As soon 
as the citrons rise to the top, take them out, 
and throw them into cold water. They 
must then be put on the fire again, in tiie 
same water, and boiled gently until tender; 
(ben take them out, and put them in cold 
■water. After this, boil them seven or eight 
times in clarified sugar; pour the whole 
into -en earthen pan, and let it stand. The 
next day drain the fruit, and boil up the 
sirup twenty or thirty times; add a little 
more sugar, and pour it over the citrons; 
do this- for three successive days, increasing 
tbe degree to which you boil the sugar daily, 
so that at tlie last boiling the degree may 
be au perle. The fruit may then be put 
into pots. 

To preserve them dry, they must be done 
exactly the same; only, instead of putting 
the fruit into pots, they should be dried on 
sieves in a stove. With the remaining sn- 
gar the citrons may be glazed. 

CITRON RATAFIA. Pare seven or 
ei^t citrons very thin; cut the peel into 
small pieces, and put them into a jar, with 
three pints of brandy, and let them infuse 
for three weeks; then add to this a pound 
of sugar, boiled in half a pint of water, and 
well skimmed; let it stand twelve or fifteen 
days longer, Ivhen it may be bottled. 

CTTRON, SIRUP OF. (1) Put into 
^ china bowl alternate layers of fine powder- 
sugar, and citron, pared, and cut in very- 



thin slices, and let them stand till the ntXL 
day; then stram off the sirup, and clarify U 
over a gentle fire. 

CITRON, SIRUP OP. (2) Put the 

rinds of three cibx)na into an earthen ves- 
sel, and strain on them the juice ; to this 
put a little water ; poor the mixture into a 
nasin in which is four pounds of clarified 
sugar, boiled to fort boulet. Place this 
basin in a large saucepan, half filled with 
water, over the fire ; stir the contents of 
the basin frequently ; -and wlien the sugar is 
entirely dissolved, and the sirup quite clear, 
take the saucepan from the fire, and let it 
cool. As soon as it is cold it may be bot- 
tled. 

CITRONNELLE RATAFIA. For 

two quarts of the best brandy, take the 
zesteB or rinds of a- dozen fine sound lem- 
ons, two drachms of bruised cinnamon, an 
ounce of coriander, and two pounds of so- 
^ar, dissolved in a pint and a half of water; 
nifiise the whole for a month, then strain 
and bottle it. 

CLOVES, OIL OF. This is made in 
the same manner as cinnamonum ; the quanti- 
ties are, an ounce of cloves to tln*ee quarts 
of brandy, and four pounds of sugar dis- 
solved in four pints of water. 

CLOVE PASTILS. Are made like 
thoee of cinnamon. The proportions are 
six cloves to half an ounce of gum-dragon. 

CLOVES, SIRUP OF. Put a quarter 
of a pound of cloves, and a quart of boiling 
water into a stewpan, cover it close, aad 
boil tliem gently for half an honr; drain the 
cloves, and to' a pint of the liquor put two 
pounds of sugcir ; beat up two eggs in a little 
cold water, add them to the above, and sim- 
mer the whole till it becomes a strong sirup. 
When cold, bottle it. 

COFFEE BONBONS. Take about a 
pint of coffee made with water; put in it a 
pound of loaf-susar; set it on tlie fire and 
boil it to a high degree ; then add a full pint 
of double cream, and let it boil again, keep- 
ing continually stirring till it comes to cara- 
mel height; to know when it is come to 
that point, you must have a basin of watw 
by you ; dip your finger in it, and put it 
quickly in your st^r, then in the water 
again, to remove the sugar, which will have 
stuck to it I take a bit of it in your' teeth ; 
if it is hard in its crackling, take it off, it 
is sufficiently done ; pour it upon a tin plate^ 
which must be nibbed before with a little 
butter, or it will stick to the plate; then 
spread it with a rolling pin ; (observe, the 



CQN 



276 



CR£ 



roHing pin muBt likewise be nibbed with 
Dutter, for fear it should stick;) when it is 
warm, you may cut it into little w^utues, lo- 
zenges, or any other shaped paslilles, and 
draw a few strokes over tliem with a knife. 

COFFEE CONSERVES. Clarify and 
boil to the first degree a pound of sugar ; 
take the sugar off the fire, and put into it 
one cup of coffee ; stir it al)out until it comes 
to the sixU) degree, that the conserve may 
■taike tlie sugar and dry. 

COFFEE EGGS. Make some good 
strong coffee ; let it rest to clear as usual, 
and sweeten it with sugar according to dis- 
cretion; beat up six yolks of eggs, witJi 
about four cups of coffee, and sift it; pour 
tliiA into little moulds in the form of eggs, or 
of any other, (do not fill them quite,) and 
bake in a mild oven, or a Dutch one, or 
with a brazing-pan; cover between two 
fires. They are made after this manner, in 
tlie shape of any fruits or birds, if you have 
proper moulds, either of copper or china, 
&c. 

COLTSFOOT, SIRUP OF. Take of 
coltsfoot six ounces, maidenhair two ounces, 
hyssop one ounce, liquorice-root one ounce; 
boil (hem in two quarts of spring water till 
one fijurth is consumed ; then strain it, and 
put to the liquor two pounds of fine powder- 
augar; clarify it with the whites of eggs, 
and boil it till it is nearly as thick as 
honey. 

CONSERVES, DRIED. For all Ports 
of conserves, the sugar should be prepared 
to the ninth degree, according to the quan- 
tity wanted ; tliey are all made much after 
the same manner, the only difference being 
in the quantity of fruits (M*oposed. Con- 
serves are made with all sorts of sweetmeat 
marmalade, sifted in a sieve, and soaked 
pretty dry over a slow fire ; use about half 
a pound of the sugar thus prepared, to a 
quarter of a pound of sweetmeat marmalade ; 
take the sugar off the fire to work them 
well together; warm the whole for a mo- 
ment, and pour it into paper cases made for 
the purpose ; when it is cool it may be cut 
into cakes of what size you please. 

CONSERVE OF FOUR FRUITS. 

Take sti'awberries, currants, clierries, and 
raspberries, of each a quarter of a pound, 
and three pounds of sugar. Bruise your 
fruit, and having strained off the juice, put 
it in a saucepan over a gentle fire, stirring 
it till reduced to half. Dissolve the sugar, 
ekim, and boil it to cassej take it from the 
fire while you put in the juice, then put it 
on again, and give it one boil, take it off. 



and keep stirring till Uie sugar babbles, wben 
the conserve may be poured into mouldi. 

CONSERVES, HARD IN MOULDS. 

These are made in the same manner m 
otlier conserves, except that they are com- 
posed of sugar, and distilled aromatic wa- 
ter ; and may be colored like pastils. 

CORIANDER DRAGEES. Take any 

quantity of coriander seeds, put them in the 
tossing-pan over the fire, and let tliem warm; 
when they are warm throw in about Haifa 
glass of vinegar, stir them well till they are 
dry ; have clarified sugar, which boil in ail- 
bother pan; then when the corianders are 
dry, add a little gum to them, and do the 
same again till they are dry, and continue 
so doing till you see the coriandei-s are cov- 
ered to the size you want to have them; 
when that is done, take the corianders out 
from the pan, wash them well, and put them 
in again, and stir them well till they are all 
warm ; then take your clarified sugar, which 
you have previously boiled to the first de« 
gree; when this is done, put it in an instru- 
ment of copper, made on pui'pose for the 
operation, and at tlie bottom of which there 
is a little hole; hang it up by a packthread 
string, that the sugar may fall from about a 
yard height into the pan where tlie corian-

keep stirring well your dragees till you see 
they are well pearled over, or roi^ and 
grainy ; when they are sufficiently so, take 
them out, and place them in the stove to 
finish drying.

strain them through a fine sieve, and poor 
the preparation into a mould lighdy buttered 
within side. Put tliis mould into a laroe 
saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of boil- 
ing water to reach within an inch of die 
mould; place the saucepan on hot adiesy 
cover it, and place hot coals on the lid; 
renew the fire underneath occasional fy, so 
as to keep the water at the same tonpera- 
ture, that is, nearly, but never quite, boil- 
ing for an hour and a half; then, if the 
cream is properly set, which may be known 
by touching it with your finger, and obserf- 
ing whetlier it may be easily detached from 
the mould, take it from the bain-marie and 
let it stand ; when no more than lukewaoB, 
turn it out on your dish. 
It sometimes happens, unavoidaUy^ that

stir it constantly with a wooden spoon ; mix 
three ounces of fine si^r with it, and con- 
tinue stirring it over tlie fire, till of a proper 
consistence, and on ihe point of boiling, 
then take it off and strain it. When tlie 
cream is ready for table, cover it complete-

it m diwipated daring the preparation of 
the sirup. To prcacrv e then the odour of 
the capillaire, when ^our sirup is sufficient- 
hf done, pour it, whilM boiling, upon some 
rah capillaire coariely chopped up; then 
cover your Tessel, and let it rtand until it 
is quite cold, then pass it through a bolting- 
cklb to separate it lW>m the feaves of the 
camliaire. 

Take .one ounce of the capillaire from 
Canada; put it into a glazed pan, pour upon 
it fouf*^ints of boiling water, leave it to in- 
fese for twelve hours over some warm ashes ; 
strain it and let it run into a vessel, it will 
give you a strong tincture of capillaire; 
meh in tliis tincture four pounds of sugar, 
put the whole into a preserving-pan, and 
put it on the fire, and clarify ii with tlie 
white of an egg, continue the cooking ; when 
your sirup is perle^ put some fresh capil- 
Uire, chopped, into a pan, and pour your 
sirup, whilst boiling, upon it; cover your 
pan carefully, and let it cool; when your 
sirup is cold, you may flavor it if you please. 
Put it into bottles, and cork tliem hermeti- 
cally. 

CAPILLAIRE, SIRUP OF. (2) Take 
0ome good capillaii*e, chop it up, not very 
small, put it upon a sieve; pour upon it 
some boiling water, and then let it infuse 
for ten hours in a vessel well covered ; strain 
this infusion, and put into it some sugar 
boiled au cassej clarify this sirup with the 
whites of ^gs whipped; skim it till it is 
very clear ; when it rises, take it ofl^ the 
fire, and leave it to cool, then put it into 
l)ottles. 

Viard and Beauvilliers, whose receipts 
are nearly the same, boil their capillaire for 
a quarter of an hour in river- water; after 
having passed this boiling tlirougii a sieve, 
they put into it some jwwder-sugar, and 
clarify their sirup with water, or a whole 
^g beaten up; then skim it, and when it is 
very clear and has boiled au /t«««, they 
take it oflf the fire, and put into it some 
orange-flower water, and strain it tlirough 
a napkin or straining-bag, leaving it to 
cool before putting it into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sirup, you 
must use two good ounces of capillaire, k>ur 
pints of water, and four pounds of sugar, 
powder-sugar is the best, as it prevents sir- 
ups from candying. 

CARAMEL. Break into a small copper 
or brass pan one pound of refined sugar; 

git in a gill of spring-water ; set it on a 
%; when it boils skira it quite clean, and 
let it boil Quick, till it comes to the degree 
called crack ; which may be known by dip- 
piiy a tea-spoon or skewer into the sugar, 
Hod letting it drop to tlie bottom of a pan 



of cold water; and if it remain bard, it kv 
attained that degree : squeeze in the joke 
of half a lemon, and let it remain one nuft' 
ute longer on the fire; then set die pan ata 
another of cokl water : have ready idqoUi 
of any shape; rub them over with sweet 
oil ; dip a spoon or fork into the sugar, and 
throw it over the mould in fine thi*eads, tiB 
it is quite covered: make a small handle of 
caramel, or stick on two or three small gam 
paste rings, by way of ornament, and plaoe 
it over small pastry of any description. 

CARAMEL CONSERVE. Clarify the 
quantity of sugar you may require, and boil 
¥^ to caramel; have ready sonie cases of 
double paper; pour in your sugar to the 
thickness of half an inch, and truce <» ib 
surface tlie forms you wish it to have ; when 
cold, break it according to diose maiks. 
This conserve may be colored* a;id &rored 
according to the fancy. 

CARAMEL COVER FOR SWEET- 
MEATS. Dissolve eight ounces of douiiile- 
refined sugar in Uiree or four spoonfuls of 
water, and thi*ee or four drops of lemon- 
juice; then put it into a copper untiimed 
skillet; when it boils to be thick, dip the 
handle of a spoon in it, and put tliat into a 
pint basin of water, squeeze the si^r from 
tlie spoon into it, and so on till you hare all 
tlie sugar. Take a bit out of tlie water, 
and if it snaps and is brittle when cold, it is 
done enough ; but only let it be three parts 
cold, then pour the water from the sugar, 
and having a copper mould oiied well, run 
the sugar on it, in the manner of a maae, 
and when cold you may put it on the dish it 
is to cover ; but if, on trial, tlie sugar is not 
brittle, pour oflf the water, and return it in- 
to the skillet, and boil it again. It shonkl 
look tliick like treacle, but of a bright light 
gold cok>r. It makes a most elegant cover. 

CARDAMUM COMFITS. Procure 

your cardamums at the chemists^ and they 
will be in a shell ; put them into the o\ea to

Eulley fixed to the beam, and a cord with a 
ook to eau:h end, so as to fix it at each 
side of the pan to let it sling; then have 
flome fine starch as white as you can get, 
and just soften it, boil some sirup a quarter 
of an hour, and mix it with the starch ; 
take some gum arabic, put it into some 
water, then put that into anollier pan, and 
make it just warm ; have an iron-pot with 
cfaaixM)al fire imder the large pan, but not 
too hot, only just to keep the pan warm ; 
have a large tub to put your pot of fire at 
bottom, and your large pan must lie on the 
top; put the caraway seeds into your pan; 
add a large ladleful of gum arabic, rub them 
with your hands until you find they are all 
dry, then put a ladleful of starch and sirup, 
and do the same over your pan of fire, until 
you find Uiey are all dry ; put the gum only 
three ot four limes to them at first, tlien the 
starch and pugai*, but boiJ your sirup more 
as you find they come to coat with it, and 
not so much starch ; when you have dried 
tbem seven or eight times, put them into 
your sieve; put tbem into the stove, do 
them the next day, and so, successively, for 
six or seven days.

of sweet almonds, moistening them with 
water ; when perfectly smooth, dilute them 
with five glasses of water put in by degrees; 
then pour them in a napkin, and squeezir^

the form of a temple, and bake them in a 
slow oven. When cold, take tlie paste 
from the tins, and join each piece together 
accordii^ to the proper forms, with isin- 
glass and water. The lower part, of 
course, ought to be stron^r than the top, 
in order that it may sustain the weight of 
the whole. The pieces also must be cut 
as exact as possible to the shape of the 
tins. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS. Taken 
pound of chocolate finely grated, and a « 
pound and a half of the best sugar, finely 
sifted ; soak some gum-dragon in orange- 
flower water, and work them into what 
form you please ; the paste must be stiff; 
dry them in a stove. You may write de- 
vices on paper, roll them up, and put them 
in the middle. 

CHOCOLATE BONBONS. Put a 
quarter of a pound of chocola^ over a fire, 
to dissolve it; and having boiled two pounds

«f ngar to forit perit, pot a tpoonM or 
ttro into the chocolate ; stir it till it forms a 
thin paste, and then pour it on the migar, 
sand boil both together to caramel. In the 
meantime 'melt a little butter, skim, and 
pour it off clear into a basin ; take a spoon- 
fiil of it, and rub it with yonr hand over a 
marble slab or table: ob this pour the choco- 
late and sugar ; then take two ends of a 
sword-blade, (one in each hand), and press 
lines an inch apart all down it ; cross them 
in like manner, so as to mark the su^r in 
email squares all over ; doing it as quick as 
possible, lest the sugar should cool before 
vou have done ; then pass the sword-blade 
between the marble and the sugar $ lay un- 
der tlie latter sheets of paper ; and when 
cold, break it into pieces according to the 
marks, and wrap each square in paper. 

CHOCOLATE COMFITS. Take two 
ounces of chocolate, beat it small with a 
little warm water over the fire ; when it is 
dissolved and reduced to a paste, pour it 
upon a pound of masse pain or sweet 
paste, to which add some cinnamon or va- 
nilla at discretion ; mix the whole well to- 
gether; then spread it over some wafer 
^apes, and bake it in a moderate oven. 
If the paste does not appear deep colored 
enough, you may color it with bolus Ar- 
menicum. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (1) Dis- 
solve two ounces of good chocolate in a 
little water, put it into a skillet with half a 
pound of sugar boiled to perle s keep tlie 
sugar stirring, and wlien it boils put the 
conserve into moulds. 

CHOCOLATE CONSERVE. (2) Dis- 
solve a quarter of a pound of grated choco- 
late in a small quantity of clarified sugar ; 
boil a pound of sugar to the premiere 
plumey put your chocolate into it, stin-ing 
• it well to mix it; serve it whilst it is warm. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. Take one 
pound and a half of chocolate, put it on a 
pewter sheet or plate, and put it in the 
oven just to warm the chocolate ; then put 
it into a copper stewpan, with three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar; 
nix it well ov«* the fire, take it off, and 
roll it in pieces the size of small marbles, 
pot them on white paper, and when they 
are all on, take the sheet of paper by each 
oomer, and lift it up and down so that the 
paper may touch the table each time, and 
Dy that means you will see the drops come 
quite fat, about the size of a sixpence ; put 
some sugar nonpareils over them, and cover 
all that are on the paper, then shake them 
off, and yoq will see all the chocolate drops 



lire oovered with the sufsr uanpmsf^% let 
them stand till cold, and they will come otf 
well, and then pot them in a box papered. 

CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM. (I) 
Take any quantity of chocolate, melt it ottf 
the fire in a small pan ; when melted poof 
it into that in which you are to make yosf 
cream; break your yolks of eggs into it, 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add soae 
pounded loaf sugar to it, keep stirrii^ ooa> 
tinually ; then add your cream 1^ little and 
little, stirring and turning it till the ivhole 
is mixed properly togetlier; then set ^oar 
pun over the fire, and keep stirring with a 
wooden spoon till you see your composition 
is near boiling, then take it off inunediate* 
ly, for, from the moro^t you set your coa- 
position over the fire till that it oSkn to 
boil, it has sufficient time to incorporate 
well auid thicken sufficiently, wichoot need 
of boiling ; and should you let it boiJ, yon 
would risk the turning your cream into 
whev, on account of the yolks of eggs, which 
would do too much. Take great can 
likewise your cream is fresh and sweet, 
for otherwise as soon as it is warm it will 
turn to curds and whey ; therefore, be care- 
ful, stir it continually, from the time von 
set it (Ml the fire till you take it off; then 
put it in the sabotiere to make it cof^geal 
after tlie usual manner. % 

CHOCOLATE ICHE CREAM. (2)

ful or two of sweet almond paste, made m 
fur macaroons, stir it In well, and then poor 
it upon the remainder of the almond paste, 
in which you have mixed a tea-spoonnil of 
powdered cinnamon or vanilla, or both: 
beat them together well in a mortar, farf 
them on paper, and bake them ibr tbre^ 
quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. 

CHOCOLATE PARFAIT AMOUR. 
For four bottles of brandy, take one pouad 
of the best chocolate, cut in small bits; a 
little salt, two cloves, and a little cioas* 
mon ; you must inflise all in the lirandy, witk 
two bottles and half a pint of water, with

tfoui two bottlee from eveqr four, except 
frmi the cinnamon, from which you are to 
take as much as you can get. 

CHOCOLATE PASTILS. Take a 
little chocokite, which put in a pan over the 
fire to melt it ; mir it with a spoon ; when 
it ifl melted, take half a pound of kxif mi- 

Sr, pounded in a mortar and »illed, which 
iBolve in a little clear water. When that 
is done, put in your chocolate; if you find 
the paste too thick, add a little water, 
enough to bring it to that degree of liquidity 
that you may take it up on a knife ; tlien 
take half a sheet of pnper, and cover it with 
little roiHid and flat drops, which we call 
paHUsy of the size of a sixpence ; let tliem 
dry naturally in a cupboard ; and when dry, 
taKe them off from the paper, and put them 
in boxes. 

CHOCOLATE PASTIL PASTE.

pound of fine powder-sugar, mixed by de- 
grees, and adding either more or less sugar, 
according as the paste is malleable ; it must 
be pretty firm ; form it into what fl<)Wei*s or 
designs you please, as sliells, lozenges, any 
kind of corn or beans, &c. 

CHOCOLATE PETIT PAINS. These 
are made in tlie same way as PetU* Paint 
a la Duchesse (see that article), but with- 
out the dorure. When cold fill them with 
a cream patitnere, mixed witli two ounces 
of vanilla chocolate, and sweetened with 
migar, flavored with vanilla ; then put three 
ounces of sifted sugar, the same of choco- 
late, and half the white of an egg into a

sugar, a dessert-spoonful of powdered cinna- 
mon, and a sufficient quantit}' of flour to 
make it into a paste ; roll it out thin, and 
cut it into whatever forme your fiincy may 
dictate, plaoe them on paper, and bake 
them. When done, remove them from the 
paper. Keep tliem dry. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (1) Soak cin- 
namon in water for four and twenty hours, 
and then cut it into pieces about an inch 
bi^ ; prepare some sugar to grand litti^ 
and give the cinnamon a boil in it ; drain 
and dry it in a stove to the proper consis- 
tence ; tiien put it in the moulds with sugar 
boiled to HmffU^ and when half cold, dry 
it. Before the candy is removed from the 
moulds, they should be laid on one side for 
some time. Keep them in paper in a dry 
place. 

CINNAMON CANDIED. (2) Cut 
some cinnamon into small sticks of about an 
inch or an inch and a half long; tlien put 
them into thin sugar, and boil tliem as it 
were in a sirup. Then take off tlie pan, 
and set it by for five or six hours to soak, 
take them out and lay them on a wire-grate, 
dry tliem thoroughly in the stove; after- 
wards put tliem in order in tin mouMs 
upon little grates made for the purpose, and 
set into the moulds, so that there may be 
tliree rows set one alx>ve another, separated 
by those gi'ates. In the meantime, boil su- 
gar till it is 6^oton, and pour it into your 
mould, so that some of it may lie upon tha 
uppermost grate ; then set them in tlie stove 
witli a covered fire, and let them stand all 
night ; tlie next morning take notice whether 
tlie cinnamon be well coagulated ; turn the 
mould upside down, and set it in the stove 
again, with a plate underneath; and when it 
is thoroughly drained, take out your sticks 
of cionamun, kx>sening them, by little and 
little, gently; then lav tliem upon a sieve, 
set in the stove, and dry them thoroughly. 

CINNAMON, CONSERVE OR

CINNAMON DRAGEES, COMMON. 
Infuse a Quarter of a pound of guro-dragon, 
in aa muck water aa wiU cover it; the next 
day put the infusion into a mortar, and stir 
at well with a peatle, and the longer it ia 
atirred the whiter it becomea; in ratlier 
more tlian a quarter of an hour, add to it 
the caked sugar which was removed from 
the preserving-pan, and which muat be well 
pounded and sifted, also a pound of powder- 
sugar, a spoonful of cinnamon powder, and 
by degrees two or three pounds of flour; 
moisten the whole occasionally with water ; 
when tlie paste is of a proper consistence, 
place it on the slab or pasteboard, knead it 
well fur a short time, roll it out in sheets, 
not tliicker tlian tlie eighth of an indi, and 
then cut it into slips of the same size as the 
<cinnamon (see above,) put tliem on paper 
or a tneve in a warm place for some days. 
Then boil some common sugar to perUt 
and su(;ar the slips of paste as above direct- 
•cd ; instead of the fine powder, flour is suffi- 
cient, until the last two layers, when the 
powder may be used to give them whiteness. 
Wlien of the requisite size, lay them on 
fieves to dry. In a few days there may be 
curled, and colored, which is done in the 
aame manner as cx>ridnder seeds. Observe, 
fine sugared cinnamon is alwaya white. 

CINNAMON, ESSENCE OF. This 
la made by infusing oil of cinnamon in 
highly rectified spirits of wine, in the pro- 
portion of half a drachm of the former to aa 
ounce of the latter.

about the thickneas of the eighth of an iochj 
place them on paper, and bake them in a 
moderate oven* When done, they may be 
finished in the iblluwing manner: — ^Boil 
aome augar in oranse-flower water, to la 
p^me, and as you take the aweetmeata fraaa 
the oven ; dip a hair-pencil into the sirups 
and brush them over ; this driea almost iiQp 
mediately, and oooaiderably improvea tht 
look of Uiem. 

CINNAMON WAFERS. Pound and 
sift six ounces of augar, and put it with an 
equal quantity of melted fresh butter, the 
same of flour, lialf an ouaoe of powdered 
cinnamon, and a small egg; stir these up ia 
an earthenware vessel, with a sufficient 
quantity of milk to make it into a tiiin, but 
not too clear, paste. Make an iron plate 
quite hot, rub it well with butter, then lay 
on it a spoonful of the paste; iry it, and 
when brown on both sides, roll it, still over 
the hot iron, round a small atick; do this 
until all the paste is used. 

CINNAMONUM. Take a quarter of 
a pound of cinnamon, two draclims of maoe, 
and one ounce of stick-liquorice; biuiae 
them well, and tlien put them into three 
quarts of the best bi-andy ; let the infusion 
stand fur some .days befot« you distil it; 
dissolve four pounds of sugar in three pinta 
and a half of ivater; mix Uiis sirup with the 
liqueur, and tlien strain them. Thia ia 
sometimes called Oil of Cinnanooo. 

CITRON, CANDIED. Pare the citrona 
very thiu and uarrnw, and tlu'ow Uiem into 
water; these are called faggots; tlien cut 
the citron into slices of any tiiickiieas yoa 
think proper; take out tlie inner part with 
great care, so as to leave only Uie white 
ring, and put theui with the fii^eots into 
boiling water; when tender, drain themu 
Boil a sufficient quantity of clarified augar 
to souffle; then put in the rings, and boil 
them together. Take it from we fire, and 
when a little cool, rub die augar against the 
side of tlte pre>erving-pan with the back of 
a spoon; aa soon as it becomes while, take 
out the rings with a fork very carefully, one 
by one, and lay them on a wire-grate to 
drain : boil and proceed with tlie faggots ia 
a similar way; wlien taken out, cut them 
iato proper lengths with a pair of aciaaoc^ 
and lay tliem also on the wire to drain. 

CITRON PASTE. Cut off the eodi 
of the citrons, take out the middle, with al 
the Bfeda; boil thpn in aoyne watmr{ iiad 



Clip

wfien quite tender, take them from the fire, 
and throw them into cold water a moment ; 
Aeiiyhnvinf^ prened them in a olotb to get 
ibe water out, pound and sifl them. To 
everv quarter of a pound of this marmalade 
put half a pound of darified sugsir; simmer 
diem together, stirring constantly until well 
mixed ; then put them into moulds, and place 
them in a stove to dry. 



CITRON WHITE PRESERVED. 
Lay some white citrons, cut into pieces, in 
Rait and water for four or 6ve hours; then, 
having waslied them in cold water, boil 
tbem; when tender, drain, and lay them 
into as much clarified sugar as will cover 
them. The next day drain off the simp, 
and boil it; when quite smooth and cold, 
pour It on the citrons; let them stand twen- 
ty-four hours; then boil the sirup again, 
and put in the citrons. The tliird day, 
boil both together, and put diem into moulds 
to candy. 

CITRON PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Cut a slit in the sides of some small citrons, 
so that the inside may take the sugar as 
well as the outside, and put them over the 
fire in some water; whenever they are near 
boiling, put cold water to them. As soon 
as the citi'ons rise to the top, take them out, 
and throw them into cold water. They 
must then be put on the (ire again, in tlie 
same water, and boiled gently until tender; 
then take them out, and pat them in cold 
^ater. Afler this, boil them seven or eight 
times in clarified sugar; pour the whole 
into «n earthen pan, and let it stand. The 
next day drain the fruit, and boil up the 
sirup twenty or thirty times; add a little 
more sugar, and pour it over the citrons; 
do this- for three sucxeasive days, increasing 
Ae degree to which you boil the sugar daily, 
80 that at the last boiling the degree may 
be au perle. The fruit may then be put 
into pots. 

To preserve them dry, they must be done 
exactly the same; only, instead of putting 
the fruit into pots, they sliould be dried on 
sieves in a stove. With the remaining sa- 
gar the citrons may be glazed. 

CITRON RATAFIA. Pare seven or 
eight citrons very thin; cot the peel into 
mall pieces, and put them into a jar, with 
three pints of brandy, and let them infuse 
fi)r three weeks; then add to this a pound 
of sugar, boiled in half a pint of water, and 
well skimmed; let it stand twelve or fifleen 
days longer, Ikhen it may be bottled. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (1) Put into 
9 china bowl alternate layers offline powder- 
Migar, and citron, paredt, and cut in very 



thin slices, and let them eland till the n^tt 
day; then stram ofT the simp, and clarify k 
over a gentle fire. 

CITRON, SIRUP OF. (2) Put the 
rindfl of three citrons into an earthen ves- 
sel, and strain on them the juice; to this 
put a little water; poor the mixture into a 
basin in which is four pounds of clarified 
sugar, boiled to fort boulet. Place this 
basin in a large saucepan, half filled with 
water, over the fire ; stir the contents of 
the basin frequently; and wlieo the sugar is 
entirely disnolved, and the sirup quite clear, 
take the saucepan from the fire, and let it 
cool. As soon as it is cold it may be bot- 
tled. 

CITRONNELLE RATAFIA. For 

two quarts of the best brandy, take the 
zeates or rinds of a> dozen fine sound lem- 
ons, two drachms of bruised cinnamon, an 
ounce of coriander, and two pounds of sn- 
?ar, dissolved in a pint and a half of water; 
mftise the whole for a month, then strain 
and bottle it. 

CLOVES, OIL OF. This is made in 
the same manner as cinnamonum ; the quanti- 
ties are, an ounce of cloves to three quarts 
of brandy, and four pounds of sugar dis- 
solved in four pints of water. 

CLOVE PASTILS. Are made like 
tho$:e of cinnamon. The proportions are 
six cloves to half an ounce of gum-dragon. 

CLOVES, SIRUP OF. Put a quarter 
of a pound of cloves, and a quart of boiling 
water into a stewpan, co\'er it close, and 
boil them gently for half an hour; drain the 
cloves, and to' a pint of the liquor put t^vo 
pounds of sugtir ; beat up two eggs- in a little 
cold water, add them to the above, and sim- 
mer tlie whole \ ill it becomes a fitrong sirup. 
When cold, bottle it. 

COFFEE BONBONS. Take ajxMit a 
pint of coflee made with water; put in it a 
pound of loaf-sugar ; set it on tlie fire and 
l)oil it to a high degree ; then add a full pint 
of double cream, and let it Irail again, keep- 
ing continually stirring till it comes to cara- 
mel height; to know wlian it is come to 
that point, you must have a basin of water 
by you; dip your finger in it, and put it 
quickly in your sugar, then in the water 
again, to remove the sugar, which will have 
stuck to it ; take a bit of it in yom' teeth ; 
if it is hard in its erackling, take it off, it 
is sufficiently done; pour it upon a tin plate, 
which must be nibbed before with a little 
butter, or it will stick to the plate; then 
spread it with a rolling pin; (observe, the

CRE 



roHing pin must likewise be rubbed with 
"biitter, for fear it should stick;) when it is 
warm, you may cut it into little efjunies, lo- 
zenges, or any other shaped pastilles, and 
draw a few strokes over them with a knife. 

COFFEE CONSERVES. Garify and 
boil to tlie first degree a pound of sugar; 
take tlie sugar oflf the fire, and put into it 
one cup of coffee ; stir it al)out until it comes 
to the sixth degree, that the conserve may 
take the sugar and dry. 

COFFEE EGGS. Make some good 
strong coffee; let it rest to clear as usual, 
and sweeten it with sugar according to dis- 
cretion; beat up six yolks of eg^9, with 
about four cups of coflee, and sift it; pour 
tliii« into little moulds in the form of eggs, or 
of any other, (do not fill tliem quite,) and 
bake in a mild oven, or a Dutch one, or 
with a brazing-pan; cover between two 
fires. They are made after this manner, in 
tlie shape of any fruits or birds, if you have 
proper moulds, either of copper or china, 
&c. 

COLTSFOOT, SIRUP OF. Take of 

coltsfoot six ounces, raaidenliair two ounces, 
hyssop one ounce, liquorice-root one ounce; 
boil them in two quarts of spring water till 
one fourth is consumed ; then strain it, and 
put to the liquor two pounds of fine powder- 
«iigar; clarify it with the whites of eg^s, 
and boil it till il is nearly as thick as 
honey. 

CONSERVES, DRIED. For all sorts 
of conserves, the sugar should be prepared 
to the ninth degree, according to the quan- 
tity wanted ; they are all made much after 
the same manner, the only difference being 
in the quantity of fruits proposed. Con- 
serves are made with all sorts of sweetmeat 
marmalade, sifled in a sieve, and soaked 
pretty dry over a slow fire ; use about half 
a pound of the sugar thus prepared, to a 
quarter of a pound of sweetmeat marmalade ; 
take the sugar off the fire to work them 
well together; warm the whole for a mo- 
ment, and pour it into paper cases made for 
the purpose; wheo it is cool it may be cut 
into cakes of what size you please. 

CONSERVE OF FOUR FRUITS. 

Take strawberries, currants, clterries, and 
raspberries, of each a quarter of a pound, 
ana three pounds of sugar. Bruise your 
fruit, and having strained off the juice, put 
it in a saucepan over a gentle fire, stirrup 
it till reduced to half Dissolve the sugar, 
Bkim, and boil it to eaise; take it from the 
fire while you put in the juice, then put it 
on Hgain, and give it one boil, take it off. 



and keep stirring till the ranr babbles, vben 

the conserve may be poured into mouUi. 

CONSERVES, HARD IN MOULDS. 

These are made in the same manner M 
other conserves, except that they are com- 
posed of sugar, and distilled aromatic wa- 
ter; and may be colored like pastils. 

CORIANDER DRAGEES. Take any 
quantity of coriander seeds, put tliem in the 
tossing-pan over the fire, and let tliem warm; 
when they are warm throw in about half a 
glass of vinegar, stir them well till they are 
dry ; have clarified sugar, which boil in an- 
■otlier pan; then when the coriaiiden are 
dry, add a little gum to them, and do the 
same again till they are dry, and continue 
so doing till you see the coriandera are cot- 
ered to the size you want to have them; 
when that is done, take the coriandera out 
from the pan, wash them well, and put them 
in again, and stir them well till they are all 
warm ; then take your clarified sugar, whicb 
you have previously boiled to the first d&< 
gree; when this is done, put it in an instnt- 
ment of copper, made on purpora for the 
operation, and at the bottom of which there 
is a little hole; hang it up by a packthread 
string, that the susar may fall from about a 
yard height into the pan where tlie coriao- 
ders are ; while the sugar (alls into your pan 
keep stirring well your dragees till yon see 
they are well pearled over, or roi^ and 
grainy ; when they are sufilciently so, take 
them out, and place them in the stove to 
finisli drying. 

CORIANDER SUGARED. These 
seeds are sugared in the same manner as 
sugared almonds. 

CREAM, BAIN-MARIE. Mix op 

whatever ingredient of which the cream 
is to be made, with ^gs and sugar ; for the

bobbles arise on the surfaoe of the cream ; 
ID sueh a c&ae, boil a ffiass of cream, and 
add to it, by degrees, three yolks of eggs; 
stir it constantlv with a wooden spoon ; mix 
three ounces of fine sugar with it, and con- 
tinue stirring it over the fire, till of a proper 
consistence, and on the point of boiling, 
theu take it off and strain it. When tlie 
cream is ready for table, cover it complete- 
ly with the last made cream, which will 
hide its defects. 

CREAM BISCUITS. Break six eggs, 
fl^arate the yolks and whites, beat the 
fermer with six ounces of powder-sugar, 
and the same of flour ; whisk the whites, 
find then mix them together ; add to it 
whipped cream, in proportion to the sugar 
and flour, stir it carefully, pour this into 
moulds or paper cases, and bake. 

CREAM CARAMEL. Put a pint of 
milk and half a pint of cream, with a bit 
of cinnamon, some corianderngeeds, and 
tiie peel of a young lemon, into a saucepan, 
and boil them for a quarter of an hour; 
then take it off the fire ; and boil a quarter 
of a pound of sugar with half a glass of wa- 
ter, until it becomes of a nice dark color; 
take it off the fire, and mix with the cream ; 
then put it on the fire again^ until the sugar 
and cream are well mixed together; then 
place a saucepan, with some hot water in 
It, over hot ashes; take a dish, in which 
3^u intend serving, and pour into it your 
cream, then place it in the saucepan ; put 
on tlie lid of the saucepan, wiUi fire almve, 
and let it boil till the cream is set. Serve 
hot. 

CREAM, SNOW. Put to a quart of 
cream the whites of three eggs well beaten, 
foar spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to your 
taste, and a bit of lemon-peel ; whip it to a 
froth ; remove the peel, and serve in a dish. 

CREAM OF ANY PRESERVED 
FRUIT. Take half a pound of the pulp 
of any preserved fruit, put it in a large pan, 
put to it the whites of two or tliree ^gs, beat 
together well for an hour; take it off with 
a spoon, and lay it heaped on a dish, or 
^iam salver, with other creams, or put it 
m the middle of a basin. Raspberries will 
BOt do this way. 

CREAM RHENISH. Put over the 
fire a pint of Rhenish wine, a stick of cin- 
namon, and half a pound of sugar; while 
this is boiling, take seven yolks and whites 
of ems, beat them well together with a 
whisk, till yow wine is half driven in them, 
and your eggs to a suiip ; strike it very fast 
wkh the wmak, till it comes to such thick-

ness diat you may lift it on the point of a 
knife, but be sure not to let it curdle; add 
to it the juice of a lemon, and orange-flower 
water; pour it into your dish; garnish it 
with citron, sugar, or biscuit, and serve. 

CREAM, ROYAL ICES. Take any 
quantity of cream, add to it yolks of eggs in 
proportion (that is, four volks of eggs to 
every pint of cream) put a Tittle half pound- 
ed coriander, cinnamon, orange or lemon- 
peel; add some pounded lump sugar, and 
set it on the fire till it nearly boils; then 
pass it through a sieve, and put it to ice. 

CREAM, WHITE SHERBET. Put 

the yolks of six eggs, and a dessert spoon- 
ful of orange-flower water or crisped orange 
flowers in powder, into two quarts of cream, 
and boil it up once in a covered saucepan ; 
then pass it through a sieve, add to it tliree- 
quarters of a pound of powder-sugar, and 
as soon as it is perfectly dicsolved, pour the 
whole into a aorbetiere, which place in an 
ice pail, and proceed to cool it as directed. 
See Sherbet. 

CREAM SNOW. Mix a quart of 
cream with the whites of six eggs, sweeten 
it with sugar and rose water, and strain 
them; then beat up the cream with a bundle 
of reeds tied together, or with a whisk; 
and as the si^ow rises take it up with a 
spoon m the cullender, that tlie liquid part 
may nm out : when you have taken off as 
much of the snow as you please, boil the 
rest of the cream, with a slick of cinnamon, 
some clovefl, and a little bruised ginger; 
boil it till it is thick; strain it, and whai 
it is cold, put it into a dish, and lay your 
snow upon it. 

CREAM, CARAMEL WHIPPED. 

Boil six ounces of sugar to caramel, and 
wlien it has acquired the proper reddish, 
yellow tinge, dissolve it in half a glass 
of boiling water, over hot ashes; after 
which, it must be reduced to a rather thick 
sirup. When cold, mix it with the whip- 
ped cream in the usual way. See Whip* 
ped Cream, 

CROQUETTES OF DESTREES. 
Use the best puff paste; roll it pretty thin, 
and cut it into different shapes, as &ncy 
leads; bake it, and dress each piece upon 
adiidi, in a handsome manner; rub them 
with a little caramel, to make them stick 
as you place them ; tlien put some currant 
jelly all over the tc^, and make what flow- 
er or design yon pleaise, with nonpareils of 
different colors, round it.

a stick of TaniHa, pmmd it with two 
ottDoes of sugar, and sift both through a 
•ilk sieve; Inix it with seveu ounces of 
sugar, well dried and poiioded, and half 
a pound of fine sifted flour ; then stir in the 
whites of four ^gs, whipped firm, and 
woi'k tlie whole together for soine minutes. 

Heal two large haking-plates of copper, 
rub tliem over lightly with virgin wax ; when 
thev are cold, take a spoonful of the prepa- 
ration, and lay it on the plate the same as 
the «poon-biscuit8, taking care to lay them 
three-quarters of an inch apart ; when both 
plates are full, place tliem on stools, in the 
oven or stove ; close the top, and lay embers 
over it, so that the croquettes may be as far 
removed from the fire as poe^sible ; let them 
reioain in this state all night; the next 
morning put them into a moderate oven, and 
bake them iifleen or twenty minutes; they 
should then quit the plate easily, and be of 
a clear reddish color; remove them from 
the plates whilst hot. The eroquettet 
may be flavored according to your fancy. 

CURACAO. This is a species of bitter 
or wild orange, of which the rind is dried, 
and may be hiid at the druggists. To make 
the liqueur called by this name, wash a 
pound of curacao several times in warm 
water; then, having well drained, put them 
into a vessel with four quarts of brandy, and 
one of water; let it stand closely covered 
for a fortnight, shaking it frequently; distil 
it after that in tlie usual way, and drain tlie 
curacao on a sieve. Sweeten it with Ave 
pounds and a half of sugar, dissolved in 
three pints of water, mix it with the spirit 
and tlien filter it. 

CURDS AND WHEY. Take a nura- 
ber of the rough coats t5at line the gizzards 
of turkeys atid fowls ; clean them irom the 
pebbles Uiey contain, rub them well with 
salt, and hang them to dry. This makes a 
more tender and delicate curd than common 
rennet. When to be used, break off some 
bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling 
water; in eight or nine hours use the liquor 
as you do other rennet. 

CURRANT CAKES. Pick and wash 
the currants, either white or red ; to two 
quarts of aui'ants, put one pint of water; 
when boiled, run the juice thrf>ugh a jelly 
bag, do not press the bag ; to one quart of 
"juice put three pounds of si]^r ; boil up the 
juice, and strew in the sugar ; pour it into 
glasses, dry it in a stove till it will turn out, 
then dry the cakes on plates. 

CURRANTS, CONSERVE OF. 
Take the seeds from two pounds of red cur- 
rants, and put diem on the fire in a silver 



pan, to dry them ; then press diem tfamrik 
a sieve, and pat them again on the fire, stv- 
rilig constantly until you can see the bottoai 
of the pan; then, having dissolved and bs3* 
ed three pounds of sugar to easse, poar it oil 
the fruit, stirring continually; in a short 
time take it off, stirring it as before raitil it 
biibUes ; tliea pour it into monlds. 

CURRANT ICES. (1) Boil two pomids 
of red currants a momrat with a quarter of 
a pound of raspberries; rub tliem through a 
sieve, adding a pint of water, and tlien the 
sugar, which must be very well dissolved 
before icing.^ 

CURRANT ICES. (2) Pidc roroe cur- 
rants from their stalks, and squeeze them 
through a sieve ; then take clarified sugar, 
boil it to a very high d^p^ee, add it to your 
cun-ant juice, and, if you clioose, squeeze in 
the juice of four lemons, it will make it 
more mellow; strain them through the sieve 
a second time, put them in the icing pot, and 
finish the same as all other icea. 

CURRANT ICE CREAM. Take one 

large spoonful and a half of currant jelly, 
put it into a basin, with half a gill of siinip, 
squeeze in one lemon and a half; add a pint 
of cream and a little cochineal, then pass h 
through a sieve, and fi^eeze it aooordiog to 
custom. 

CURRANT WATER ICE. Take a 
large spoonful and a half of currant jelly, put 
it into a basin, and add to it the juice of 
two lemons, half a gill of sirup, and a pint 
of water: then freeze it rich. 

CURRANT JELLY FRABfBOISEE. 

Take seven pounds of fine ripe red carrants, 
three of white, and two of white raspber- 
ries, press them throng a very close horse* 
hair sieve ; pour the juice on nine poun^ 
of double-refined sugar, brokra in smaB 
pieces, place the whole on a brisk fire, tak- 
ing care to remove the scum as soon as it 
appears. When the boilings foJfow each 
other very quickly, take out the skimmer, 
(which should be of copper) stir it, and let 
the jelly fall from if ; on quitting the skim- 
mer it ought to fail like treacle. If it does 
so, it is sufficiently done. This jelly should 
be rose-colored; \>y making it entirely of 
red currants and red raspberries, the ookr 
of die jelly will be red. 

CURRANT PASTE. Pick and take 
die seeds firom ten pounds of fine red cor* 
rants, crush them, and having pressed oat 
the juice, strain it through a silk sievft 
Clarify and boil to eatte an equal qaantJCf 
of sugar, pour the ourraat juioeoo H, aetm

«rfaole over a gentle fire, stirring constantly 
nntil it becomes d* a proper oonsistmioe, 
wfaich may be known by observing when the 
bottom of the pan can be seen clearly ; take 
it off from the fire as soon as that is the 
case, and pour the paste into tin moulds, 
which must be placed on slates, or copper 
plates: smooth the tops with the blade of a 
knife, sprinkle sifted sugar over, «ind place 
diem in a stove, where they must remain till 
next day ; when the paste should be turned 
in the moulds; sprinkle siAed sugar over 
them again, and set them in the stove a 
second night; on the following day remove 
them from the moulds, lay it in boxes, with 
white paper between each layer, and keep 
theoi in a di-y place. A sixth part of the 
quantity of raspberries added to tlie entrants, 
would greatly improve the flavor of this 
paste. 

CURRANT PASTILS. Take half a 
pound of pounded loaf sugar on a plate, then 
a quantity of currants, which squee^ through 
a sieve ; when that is done, add the juice to 
the sugar, till it makes a paste as clear and 
thick as you think proper. 

CURRANT SHRUB. To five pints of 
cnn'ant juice, either red or white, one pound 
and a half of loaf sugar ; when dissolved, 
put to it one ^Ibn of rum or brandy; clear 
It through a flannel bag. 

CURRANT SIRUP. Put five or six 
pounds of red, two of white currants, and 
two bottles of raspberries, into a sieve; crush 
them, and press tlie juice through it into a 
pan, and place it in a cellar to ferment ; in a 
week's lime, pass the juice through a strain- 
ing bag, and having clarified, and boiled to 
Jwt souffie four pounds of sugar, put the 
juice to it, and boil them together once; 
akim, and take it from the fire. It is ne- 
cessary that the currant juice should ferment, 
to prevent its becoming a jelly in the bottles* 



D. 



DRAGEES, COMMON. The paste for 
these drageet is made in the same manner 
as for the better stnt, but the materials difier 
a little: tlius to a quarter of a pound of the 
gum, take either equal quantities of sugar 
and powdw, or one-third of the former to 
two-thirds of the latter. When tliese and 
the gum are well mixed, roll out the paste 
notil it is as thin as the back of a knife- 
blade; then take a paste-cutter, shaped like 
a sugar-loaf, with the top taken off, witb.the 
largest end of which, cut as many pieces of 
the paste aa will about two-tbircb fiU the 



cutter; press these throi^ the smaller end 
into paper cases; set them in a warm place 
for several dnys. These kind of drageet 
may, if liked, be sugared in the same man- 
ner as almonds. 

DRAGEES EN PASTILLAGE. These 
dragees are made of the same materials as 
the superfine drageeas the only difference 
consists in their forms, which resemble the 
bonbont: to make them, it is necessary to 
have a number of wooden moulds, (pear- 
(ree wood is the best), on which must be 
stamped small squares, with various devices 
engraved on tltera. Cut your paste into 
small pieces ; press each piece on a mould ; 
take ofi' all the super-abundant paste; tlien 
dip your finger in water, and with it remove 
the paste from the mould; dry them in cases 
like the other dragte». 

DRAGEES, SUPERFINE. Pot a 

quarter of a pound of the best gum-dragoa 
into a pan, with a pint of cold water, cover, 
and let it stand for twenty-four hours; then 
take a strong close cloth, about two feet 
long, and put a part of your gum into it; 
ibid it three times, so as to envelope the gum; 
then wring the cloth, by which means the 
purest gum will be fcnrced through; scrape 
it off carefully with a knife, and then proceed 
in tlie same way, until all the gum be strain- 
ed ; put it into a marble mortar, and stir it 
about with a pestle for half an hour; th^ 
add to it a pound of doul>le-refined sifted 
sugar; mix them together well, until it be- 
comes a stiff paste; divide this into five 
parts, four of which must be tinged as fol- 
lows: red, blue, yellow, and green, (the fifth 
left white), with the usual coloring materials. 
Before, however, they are colored, add to 
each piece, a pound and a half of double- 
refined su^r, sifted, dipping the paste in 
water occasionally, to enable it to receive 
the additional quantity of su^r. When you 
mix in the coloring materials, add also a 
coiTesponding perfiime: as, to the red, ros^ 
.water, and a few drops of essence of roses; 
to the blue, oil of violets ; to the yelbw, es- 
sence of cedar; to the green, essence' of 
bergamot ; and with the white, mix a little 
orange-flower wata*, and some drops of es- 
sence of Neroli, 

Your paste being thus prepared, form it 
of whatever little ornaments ^ou please, such 
as eggs, balls, turnips, (adding green leavei 
to these), &c. of the white; of the yellow, 
apricots, pears, carrots, &c.; plums, &6. 
of the blue ; and so on ; rolling them in your 
hands to smooth them, and make them all 
quite small; to those which imitate fruits, 
add tails and tops, cut fixMOB cherry-stalks, 
and stuck on whilst the paste is damp ; and 
with a hair«peucil, dipped in powdered cio-

EGGS CARAMEL. Take the yolks 
of a dozen hard eggs, bruise tliem in a sauce- 

Ean, with some powder-sugar, three almond 
iscoits, and half a glass of cream ; make 
these into a paste, of which form little eggs, 
dip them in caramel sugar, and brown diem. 

EGGS DUCHESSE. Boil k pint and 
a half of cream with some sugar, orange- 
flower, candied lemon-peel, marchpane, and 
burnt almonds, all chopped small or bruised ; 
whip up the whites of eight eggs well, and 
liien take two or three spoonfuls of tliem at 
a time, and poach them in the cream ; drain, 
and lay them on a dish, so as to resemble 
eggs poached without the yolks. When all 
the whites are thus used, put the cream on 
the fire, and reduce it, and as the dish is 
•eot to table, add the yolks to die cream, 
and pour the sauce gently over tlie ^gs. 

EGGS FILAGRAMME. Take a pint 
of white wine, half a pound of fine powder- 
aogar, and make it into a clear sinip with 
the white of an e§^; beat up well eifflit 
eggs, and pour them through a cojander 
into the sirup ; a very short time is sufficient 
to cook them. Serve either hot or cold. 

EGGS OP SNOW. Break ten eggs, 
and having separated the yolks and whites, 
^ip the latter as for biscuits; then add 
two spoonfuls of powder'sngar, and a little 
dried orange-fiower in powder. Pour a 
quart of milk, six ounces of powder-sugar, 
and a little orange-flower, into a saucepan, 
and when it boils put into it, a dessert-spoon- 
fiil at a thne, of the while of egg ; poach (he 
latter, and then set them on a sieve to drain. 
Then beat up the yolks, and mix tliem with 
half the milk, put it on the fire, and stir it 
with a wooden-spoon till it begins to thick- 
en ; then take it off, lay the poaciied eggs in 
a dish, and cover them with the yolks and 
milk. 

EGGS, WHITE OF. To make a dish 
of these, take the whites of twelve eggs, 
beat diem up with four spoonfuls of rose-wa- 
ter, some lemon-peel grated, and a little 
nutmeg; sweeten diem with sugar, mix 
them well, and boil them in four bladders; 
tie them in the shape of an en, and boil 
them hard; they will take hau aa hour; 



lay diem in a dish ; when Cold, mf x hrif m 
pint of thick cream, a gill of mountain, and

FILBERT BISCUITS. Take 
Barcelona filbert nuts, and put them in a mor- 
tar to break dieir shells; pick all the sheik 
from them clean, pound them in a mortar 
very fine, and mix whites of eggs with them; 
take care tliey do not oil ; mix three pounds 
of powdered-sugar, with the nuts and whites 
of e^»f to a proper diickness ; let your uvea 
be ofa moderate heat, then with thiespaddle 
and knife, drop small pieces, about half ai 
big as a nutmeg ; put two or three slieets of 
paper und^ them, let them bake of a fine 
brown, and all alike ; and let them be cold 
before you take them off the paper. 

FILBERT CANNELLONS. Bora 
and pound six ounces of filberts, moist- 
ening them with white of egg; wlien weH 
pounded, add a quarter of a pound of 
line pr>unded sugar, and half the white ofao 
egg; dry this paste a little, and then press 
it through a syringe, cutting the eanneliont 
about four inches in length ; make the /H- 
ture quite hot, dip the cannellona in batter, 
and fry them. Sprinkle them with sugar, 
and gjaze them with a salainander. Take 
particular care to keep the cannellona pef- 
fectly straight. 

FILBERT BURNT, ICE CREAM. 
Roast some Barcelona nuts well in tlie oven, 
and pound them a little with some cream; 
put four eggs into a stewpan, with one pint 
of cream and two gills of sirup ; boil it till it 
becomes thick, pass it through a sieve, and 
freeze it ; then mix the filberts with it be- 
fore you |iut it into ycKir moulds. 

FILBERT MACAROONS. Take a 
pound of filberts, and put a quarter of them 
into a preserving-pan (immeuiately after yea 
have taken them from the shells,) over a 
moderate fire; stir them continually with ft 
silver spoon, until the^ are colored, and the 
skin fa^ns to peel on; tlien take them oat; 
rub ofl^the skin entirely, and when qoite 
cold, pound them with a little white of egg: 
proceed in the same manner with the re- 
maining three-quarters; and when all are 
thus puunded separately, put the wlwie ti>- 
gether ' into the mortar, with a pound of 
sugstr, and the wliites of two ^gs, and beat 
them for ten minutes; after which, add two 
pounds more of sifted sugar, previously heat*

en flp wUb itx whites dtfj^ ; ftir aH these 
tc^ther well for five or six minutes, when 
the pmeparatioD should be sufficiently firm, to 
prevent its spreading when laid; if, liow- 
ever, it be too firm, add to it more white of 
egg. When you have proceeded so far, wet 
the palms of your iiands, and roll a spoonful 
of the preparation to the size and form of a 
nutmeg; when all done, dip your bands in 
water, and pass them gently over the maca- 
roons, which will make their surface smooth 
and shining; put them into a nearly cold 
oven ; close it tight, and let them remain in 
it for three-quarters of an hour. Lay the 
macaroons at least an inch apart, and as 
round as possible. 

FLOWERS IN SUGAR. Clarify sn- 
ear to a caramel height, which may be 
knowii by dipping in a fork, and if it throws 
the sugar as fine as threads, put in the flow- 
ers. Have ready some tea-cups, witli the 
insides rubbed with sweet oil ; put into each 
cup four table-spoonfuls of tlie sugar and 
flowers, and when cold turn tliem out of the 
cups, and serve them to table piled one upon 
another. 

FRUIT BISCUITS. To the pulp of 
any scalded fruit, put an equal quantity of 
iugar siAed, beat it two hours ; then put it 
into little white paper forms ; dry them in a 
eool oven, turn them the next day, and in 
two or three days box them. 

FRUIT, PRESERVED, BISCUITS 
OF. Take dried preserved fhiits, such as 
apricots, veijuice, grapes, plums, oranges, 
and a little orange-flower marmalade; 
pound them togetlier, and sift in a sieve ; 
then mix it with yolks of new laid eggs, and 
fine powder-sugar, until it comes to a supple 
paste, not too liquid; then bake them on 
paper in a moderate oven. 



G. 



GINGER, CANDIED. Put an ounce 
of ginger, grated fine, and a pound of sifted 
sugar into a preserving-pan with as much 
water as will dissolve it. Stir them well 
together over a sk>w fire, till the sugar be- 
gins to boil ; then add another pound, stir- 
ring constantly till it thickens. Take it 
from the fire, drop it on eartiien dishes, set 
them in a warm place to dry, 9nd they will 
be hard and brittle and look white. 

GOOSEBERRY CAKES. Bleak the 
gooseberries, press out the juice, and strain 
It through a muslin ; to one pint of juice a 
pound of sugar; boil up the juice; strew in 

16 



the alegar: stir it well; simmer it well tiU 

the su^r is united; pour it into glasses: 
dry it m a stove till it will turn out, then 
dry the cakes on plates. 

GOOSEBERRIES, GREEN, COM- 
POTE OF. Give them a Kttle cut on one 
side to squeeze out the seeds, and put them 
in hot water to scald, till they rise to the 
top; then putcokl water to them, adding a 
little salt, to bring them to their natural 
ereen ; simmer them in clarified sugar, and 
let them remain in sometime to imbilje the 
sweet ; take thehi out, and put them in the 
compotier ; reduce the sirup to a good con- 
sistence, and pour it over the fnut. This 
is for green gooseberries ; but if you make 
use of presented ones, warm Uiera in their 
own sirup and a little water, and serve it 
eitlier hot or cold. These will not keep 
long, particularly if they have been wanned 
again : if exposed to the air any time, thej 
will lose tlieir cok)r. 

GRAPE ICE. Take ripe grapes, pick 
them from their stalks, pass tliem through 
a sieve ; mix some sugar witli the juice of 
four lemons squeezed upon it; pass the 
whole together a second time through a 
sieve, then freeze it. 

GRAPES RATAFIA. Take some 
fine muscadine grapes, pick them from the 
stalks ; hi'uise and press them, so as to ex* 
tract all their juice ; then dissolve some su- 
gar in the grape juice, adding to it brandy ' 
and cinnamon ; let the whole infuse for a 
fortnight ; then strain it through a filtering 
bag, and bottle it ofl*. The proper propor- 
tions are one pint of brandy^ and ten ounces 
of sugar to one pint of grape juice. 

GREEN-GAGES TO CANDY. When 
finished in the sirup, (see green-gages to 
preserve,) put a layer into a new sieve, 
and dip it suddenly into hot water, to take 
ofl* the sirup that hangs about it ; then put 
it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and 
then do some more on the sieve. Have 
ready some sifted doiible-refined sugar, sift 
this all over every part of the fruit, till it is 
perfectly while. Set it on the shallow end 
of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn 
it two or three times. It must not be cold 
till diy. Watch it carefully. 

GREEN GAGES TO PRESERVE. 

You must choose the largest, when tliey be- 
gin to soften ; split witliout paring them, and ^ 
having previously weighed an equal quanti- 
ty of sugar, strew a pait of it over them; 
blanch the kernels with a small nharp knife ; 
next day, \mw the sirup from the fruit, and 
boil it with the other sugar, very gently, for

squeeze it; repeat this till the whole is 
through; then lay it on the slab, work it 
well with your hand, put in nearly all the 
Juice of one lemon, and a pound of the best 
double reftned powder-sugar, by degrees, as 
you work it ; but before ^ou have put in the 
whole of the sugar, begm lo add some of 
the best starch powder; blend them thor- 
oughly together, till the paste begins to 
take an impression ; then roll it in a cloth, 
and let it stand in a damp place for a week 
or ten days, (it is the lietter fcH' keeping), 
work it with powder, and it will cut and 
mould to any shape you please, and when 
you want it to harden, set it in a dry pbce ; 
if you wii<h to color it, to make it red, use 
cochineal or carmine ; for blue or violet

being well mixed, cut some slieets of wafer 
paper into such figures as your fancy may 
dictate, and spread the paste over them» 
about a quarter of an inch in thickness; 
place tliera on paper, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. If you wish to glaze your

• MACAROONS, SPICED. Take a 
pound of sweet almonds, and two pounds of 
sifted sugar ; make your paste as usual, to 
which add a spoonful of powdered cinnamon, 
six or eight cloves, also pounded, some pre-^ 
■erved lemon and oranse-peel (of each a 
spoonful,) chopped small, and the grated 
rind of two lemons; mix them all together 
in tlie mortar,, and' then lay your macaroons 
as usual, and bake them with equal care. 

MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. The 
maeedoine is an ornamental dish, composed 
of transparent jelly, with various fniils tan- 
closed in it; for this purpose it should be 
done as follows: Have a dome-shaped mould 
six inches and a half in diameter, and four 
in height, the sides fluted ; the smaller mould 
must be of a similar form, but only four inch- 
es and a half in diameter, and two and three- 
auarters high ; to this latter have four han- 
les, bent at the end, to hang it exactly in 



tto Matre of the lai^ger nenkl. Pmpanm 
strawlierry transparent jellv, pboe tiw kajpr 
mouM as straight as possiue m poanded ioi^ 
hang the small one in it, and poi|r the jc% 
into the fermer; whilst it is ooiuealia^ 
pick about twoity fine white Btrawberrieik 
the same number of very red ones, the aunt ' 
of white raspberries, a dozeo bunches oi red, 
and the same of white currants ; wash aU 
these well, but touch them as littfe as possi- 
ble, tliat they may not lose their freshness; 
when the jelly is perfectly set, pour some 
hot water into the small mould which wiB 
enable you to remove it with ease ; raise it 
with great care, so that the space may be 
found without the slightest flaw ; then place 
on the jelly (in the centre of this space) two 
bunches of white currants, surround these 
with a ring of white strawberries, and the 
latter with a crown or ring of white rasp- 
berries; pour over very carefiilly two or 
three spoonfuls of the jelly, and when that is 
congealed, procseil in the same way with 
the red cuiranls, strawberries, and raspber- 
ries, tlien tlie jelly, and so on alternately^ 
until all the fruit is used ; fill the mould with 
jelly ; as soon as the whole is congealed, dip 
your mould into a larpe saucepan of hot 
water, and then turn it into a dish instantly. 
The maeedoine may be samished in this 
manner with any kind of fruit you think 
proper. It may also be filled with two jel- 
lies as follows: white lemon jelly in die 
lai^ mould, and finished with the same 
jelly, tinged with either roee-ooloror yellow; 
indeed the moulds may be varied in any way 
your fancy may dictate. 

MALLOWS, SIRUP OF. Take half 
a pound of mallows root, and having scrap- 
ed and washed it well, cut it into smul 
pieces, which set on the fire with three pints 
of water ; when sufficiently boiled, the wa- 
ter will be glutinous, strain off the decoction, 
and pour into it four pounds erf* sugar; clari- 
fy it in the same manner as capiusiie ; boil 
it to /use, run it through « jjelly-beg, and 
when cold, bottle it. 

MARASCHINO. Take sixteen ponndi 
of fine sharp cherries, stone and take off 
the stalks; put them into five quarts sf 
Innndy to infuse, covered close lor thrtt 
days,'tlien distil the infiision; distil also a 
pound of cherry-leaves in six quarts of filto^ 
ed river water, from which you will obtain 
about a gallon ; dissolve in this (bar pounds 
and a half of fine sugar ; add it to the li- 
queur, with two pints and a half (rf* kirschoB- 
wasser, an ounce and four drachms of spirits 
of rose, the same of orange-flowers, and 
three drachms of spirits of jessamine; mil 
them altogether, run it through a jelly4»f, 
and bottle it; cork them well.

MARASCHINO, CONSERVE OF. 

Pocmd and sift some of llie best lump siignr, 
mix it in B china baRin with ppint of maras- 
chino, until it is of the consistence of paiitil 
parte; then put it into a skillet over the fire, 
and heat it ^ntty, stirring it constantly (hut 
without letting it Imil,) till very liquid, when 
it may be poured into funnel-shaped tin 
moQlds; p<it these moulds on iron plates, 
and dry the conserve in a stove. 

MARASCHINO ICE CREAM. Take 

two quaits of cream, twelve eggs, a pound 
of double-i'efined sugar, and three glasses 
of true maraschino ; put the cream on to 
boil, and in the meantime whisk the whites 
of the eggs to a firm snow, then pour in 
eight yolks, and the sugar pnimded and 
sifted, stir them together lightly, and then 
add by degress the boiling cream, whipping 
oontinually ; set it on tlie fire, and do not 
cease whipping until it has boiled up three 
or lour times ; pour it through a sieve into 
a basin, stirring a tittle to enable it to run 
more freely ; when 'cold put it into the sor- 
hetiere with the maraschino ; cover it in- 
ttantly, and ice it as usual. 

MARCHPANE. Take four pounds of 
sweet almonds, throw them into boiling 
water, let them lay till the skin bosens, 
tiicn put them into cold water, after a few 
minutes blanch and throw them again into 
Cold water to wash them thoroughly. When 
dry, pound them (a handful at a time) to a 
Tcry tine paste, moistening each handful 
with two s|)oonfuls of water; the whole 
quantity of almonds being pounded, put the' 
paste into a large preser\'ing pan, with four 
pounds of the best lump sugar finely pound- 
ed and sif\ed ; set the pan on a- coal fire, 
fltir and' work them up together with a 
lai^ wooden spatula, rather sharp at the 
bottom: be very careful that none of the 
paste adheres to the pan ; the consequence 
of such neglect would be, that the maix'h- 
pane would be spotted with yellow, and 
would emell unpleasantly. Whilst working 
it up, the paste, which when put in was 
tolerably firm, will become rather liquid, 
and a gi«at deal of vapor may be obseiTed ; 
die first is caused by the sugar dissolved by 
the heat and moisture, the second by the 
evaporation of the water. Continue to stir 
and work it up in this manner without 
ceasing for two hours, and if at the end of 
that time, you can touch the paste without 
its adhering to your fingei*s, it is uufficiently 
dried; in which case remove it all to one 
aide of the pan, clean ttie bottom and side 
of the other, sprinkle it well with fiour, then 
put the paste to that pait, clean and sprin- 
kle that side also; uien take the pan by 
both ears and move it round and coundt so 



that the paste may .all unite together; atf 
soon as it has done so, put it into a sheet of 
paper, or, if you wanl to use it immediate- 
ly, on a well floured table. This paste, if 
the almonds lie well pounded and then thor- 
oughly dried, will keep good for six months; 
if iliese two precautions are not properly 
attended to, it will become sour in ten days. 

MARIGOLDS, CONSERVE OF. Take 
four ounces of marigold-flowers, conserve of 
hyacinth and liermes, of each four drachmSy 
tlie powder of pearl two ounces, and as 
much sittip of citron as will make tl)em into- 
a conserve, mixing and bruising tliem to-- 
gether with refined sugar. 

MARJORAM CONSERVE. Take 

the tops and tendcrest^ part of sweet marjo-\ 
ram, bruise it well in a wooden mortar or 
liowl ; take double its weight of fine sugar, 
boil it with marjoram-water till it is as 
thick as sirup, then put in your beaten mar- 
joram. 

MARSEILLES, OR GINGER. Take 

a pound and a half of double-refined sugar, 
and boil it to fort touffle, add to it an 
ounce of ginger in powder, remove the paa 
from the fire, and with a round stick (like 
a plain round rule) stir the sugar,, inclining; 
the stick towards the sides of the pan, ihea 
with a spoon take the sugar that sticks to 
the edofes and put it amongst the liquid, then 
work It up again with the stick, remove the 
solid sugar as before, and repeat this opera- 
tion four times, when it will havel>ecouie tole- 
rably thick and firm ; pour it into paper cases, 
alwut half an inch thick, and with a fork 
trace on its surface, whilst warm, lozenges 
of what size you please; aAerwards, with 
the point of a knife, mark some of these 
deeper than the others; when quite cold, 
take them out of the papers, and separate 
them, where the lines are deepest. The 
Marseilles, if preserved in a warm or dry 
place, will keep good for a long time. 

MARSEILLES SPICED. Take a 
pound and a half of fine sugar, boil it to 
ca»»e; take a quarter of preserved orange- 
peel, the same of candled lemon-peel, (or, 
if you like it better, two ounces of blanched 
pistachio nuts), cut them into dice, and put 
them with half an ounce of cloves, the same 
of cinnamon (both pounded) into the sugar, 
stir them in gently, continue to boil your 
sii-up to forte plume; then beat it up, pour 
it into cases, and finish as tlie Marseillet, 

MELONS, TO PRESERVE LIKE 
GINGER. Half a pound of ginger to one 
pound of melon; scrape tlie ginger, and 
save the scrapings ; ^ur a qiiai*t of boiling

water on the gioger, let it ftand two days: 
•cald tlie melon (with the scrapings of the 
ginger in the water), taking care not to 
make it too soft: cut it into sinnil pieces 
resembling ginger; then prepare a sirup, 
half a pound of sugar to a pint of water; 
boil ihe ginger in it; when o«ld, put in tlie 
neion, and set it over the fire for a short 
time, but not to boil ; let the sirup, with 
the ginger, be boiled evMy day for a fort- 
night, but not poured upon the mekNi till 
nearly cold; then boil a rich sirup to keep 
it in. 

N. B. CJarrot is equally good with mebn. 

MERINGUES. (1) Whisk the whites of 
nineeggti to a solid frolh; then add the rind 
of six lemons, grated extremely fine, and a 
spoonful of sifled sugar; after which, lay a 
Bheet of wet paper on a tin, and with a 
spoon drop die mixture in little lumps, 
aeparately upon it, siA sugar over, and put 
them to liake in a moderately heated oven, 
taking care that they are done of a nice 
color. Then put raspberry, apricot, or any

toms, add them together, and lay them in 
a warm place, or before Uie fire to dry. 

MERINGUES. (2) Take the whites 
of twelve eggs, six ounces of tlie best lump 
sugar, pounded and sifled, and half a pound

a mortar, witli a little' white of egg, to a 
very fine paste. Whisk the whites of eggs 
to a 80OW, then add the sugar, and pista- 
chio paste, mix them well, but very lightly, 
and when they are thoroughly incorporated, 
put some sheets of paper on tin plates, lay 
vour prepsiralion on the paper, widi a spoon, 
lay the meringue*, at least an inch apart; 
sprinkle sifted sugar over them, and put 
them into a moderate ,oven or stove ; when 
done, detach them gently from the paper 
with a knife, and place them on a sieve in 
a dry place. Just before they are sent to 
table, £11 each with a little whipped cream, 
to which add a small quantity of either 
orange-flower, rose, or vanilla water. 

MILK PUNCH. Pare six oranges, and 
six lemons, as thin as you possibly can, 
ffrate them after with sugar to obtain tlie 
flavor. Steep the peels in a bottle of rum 
or brandy, stopped close for four and twenty 
hours. Squeeze the fruit on two pounds of 
sugar, add four quarts of water to it, and 
one (^uart of new milk, boiling hot; stir the 
mm into the above, and run it througli a 
jellv-bag until it is quite clear: bottle and 
cork it close immediately. 

MINT, DISTILLED LIQUEUR OF. 
Tal^ two hand^ of fiiesh gathered garden 



mint, and inftwe it for some days in a gaflon 
and a half of brandy, and a quart of water ; 
then distil it as usual. Dissolve three 
pounds and a half of si^ar in seven pints of 
water, mix the sirup with the U^eur, and 
run the whole through a jefly bag. 

MINT WATER. Take firar pounds ai 
dried mint, two gallons and a half of proof 
spirits, and three galbns of water; disdl

and a half of sugar. 

MIRLITONS. Put into a pan two 
yolks, and two whole eggs, four ounces of 
powder-sugar, three ounces of sweet maca* 
roons crushed, half an ounce of crisped 
orange-flowers in powder, and a grain of 
snlt; stir these together a minute, then add 
two ounces of melted botto*; whip the two 
whites very firm, and put them also to the 
preparation. Line thirty tartlet mookis with 
puff- paste, into each of which pour an equal 
quantity of the above; cover them with 
sifted sugar, and when that is dissolved, 
strew over a little sugar, a la grelt; and 
put them into a moderate oven : serve either 
hot or cold. 

MULBERRIES, SIRUP Of, Take 
as many mulberries as will yield three pints 
of juice, which put into a preserving pan 
with three pints of water; boil until this 
quantity is reduce^! to one pint ; then lay dis 
fruit on a sieve to drain. Clarify three 
pounds of sugar, boil it to bouiUes then add

in a similar manner, but being leas powerlsl 
than the musk, four grains is the proportioB 
to a quarter of a pound of sugar. 

MYRTLE, OIL OF. Put two ooncei 

of peach leaves, and tlie half of a notineg^ 
bruised, into six quarts of brandy; disul 
from this in a 6atn marie alembic your li-

colored of a clear yellow ; in the meantime, 
put three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar 
into a preserving pan, set it on a stove, 
stirring with a wooden spoon until com- 
pletely dissolved ; then take the almonds nut 
of the oven, and whilst hot throw them into 
the liquid sugar; mix them together well. 
Have ready a mould well oiled, of any sliape 
you think proper, in the interior of which 
place tlie sljps of almonds, by means of lem- 
on-juice, when the whole is covered, remove 
the mould carefully, and serve the Nougat. 

NOYAU, ENGLISH. Two galbns of 
gin, two pounds of bitter almonds, one pound 
ot sweet almonds, both beaten to a fine paste*; 
six poimds of lump sugar^ pounded (some of 
it with the almonds.) Let these stand ten 
days in the gin, then filter it through blotting 
paper, and bottle it. 

NUT BONBONS. Boil a pound of 
Spanish nuts; when they are well boiled, 
rub off their skin with a napkin, if some 
stick too hard, pare it off with a knife; 
grate your nuts very fine on a sheet of pa- 
per; then take a pound of- powdered sugar 
to a pound of nuts, put it in a pan over a 
slow fire; when your sugar is all melted 
(you must stir it constantly with a wooden 
spoon) put your nuts in, and work them well 
till all is well mixed, and poiu* it upon a tin 
plate; then spread it with a rolling pin, this 
must be done very quiclcly, as it cools very 
iast; when it is cold, cut it into what form 
you please ; you must take care the sugar is 
not too mtidi melted, for it is very apt to 
soften when tlie nuts are added to it. 

NUTS PRALINED. Take a pound 
<^ Spanish nuts, take them out of their 
shells, and put them into a pan, with a 
pound of loaf sugar, and a litile water ; let 
them boil till they begin to sparkle; then 
take them off the fire, and stir them well 
with a wooden spoon, till you perceive the 
sugar turns gravelly; then set them again 



over a slow fire, to dissolve the sugar; keep 
stirring, that the sugar may stick to the nuts, 
and when you see them turn reddish, and 
are well covered with sugar, take them off, 
pour them into a sieve, cover them with a 
clean cloth, and put them into a stove ; this 
will preserve their gloss. 

NUTMEGS TO CANDY. Take a 
pound and a half of double refined sugar, 
half a quarter of a pint of damask rose-wa- 
ter, and a very little gum arabic ; boil these 
to a candy height ; let your nutmegs be first 
soaked in water; then put them into an 
earthen pan, pour your candy to them, keep 
them very close covered, set tliem in a warm 
place for about thi'ee weeks, and they will 
be of a rock caqdy. 



O. 



OIL OF JUPITER. Take three quarts 
of spirits of wine, flavored with essential oil 
of lemon, the same quantity flavored with 
spirit of cedrat; make a sirup with seven 
pounds of sugar, a gallon of water, and two 
twttles of Scubac ; mix the whole together, 
and by stirring, it will become thick; to 
clarify it, take the whites of two eggs in 
about a pint of the liqueur, and afterwards 
put it to the whole ; stir it ; then put it into 
a still in the 6atn marie moderately heated; 
let it remain for twelve hours ; filter the pro- 
duce of your distillation, and bottle it. 

OIL OF VENUS. Reduce the follow- 
ing articles to an impalpable powder: — an 
ounce of skirret seeds, an ounce of caraway 
seeds, an ounce of anise seeds, a drachm 
and a half of mace, and the rind of an or- 
ange; infuse these for five days in a gallon 
of brandy, then distil from it in a hain ma- 
rie, two quarts of liqueur; dissolve over 
tlie fire four pounds of sugar in two quarts 
of pure water; when cold, mix it with the 
distilled liqueur , and color it of a clear yel- 
low, with a little tincture of saffron ; filter 
and bottle it ; seal the corks. 

ORANGES IN BRANDY. Choose 
the oranges very round and smooth, pare, 
prick them in the middle, and put them into 
cold water; then blanch them in boiling 
water; when they are tender, throw them 
again into cold water ; in a short time give 
them seven or eigtit boils in sugar, a la pe- 
tite nappe, Bk'nn,. and let them stand till 
next day, when the same process must be 
gone through; skim them again, then put 
^em into bottles, pour over them equal 
quantities of sirup and water ; take care to 
oorifc them well.

over a slow fire for lialf an hour; serve cold. 

ORANGE, CROQUE EN BOTT- 
CHES OF. Pare a dozen fine oranges, 
and divide each into twelve pieces, alt of , 
the same size ; scrape off every particle of 
the white, without breaking the tliin skin 
which contains the juice ; wlien all are done, 
dip each piece inCo some sugar boiled to 
casse (.ind lightly colored,) and place them 
in a plain rnouM of six indies diameter, and 
five ip height ; the first row inclined one way, 
the f«(x>nd ihe reverse way, and so on ; lay 
them at the bottom in a star. As soon aa 
the mould \s full, turn it out, and serve it 
with all possible expedition, as the moisture 
of the fruit dissolves the sugar so rapidly, 
that the croque en bouche is liiible to fall 
to pieces. 

ORANGE CAKES. Divide the or- 
anges in half, take out the seeds,' and put 
the pulp and juic« into a basin; boil the 
rinds in a saucepan of water, closely coi'er-

dry them upon a cloth ; allow to a pound of 
orange rinds, two of pounded loaf sugar ; 
pound the rinds in a mortar ; add by^egrees 
the sugar, and then the juice and pulp ; mix 
it thoroughly till thick and yellow; drop it 
upon tins in small cakes, and dry them un- 
der garden glasses, or in a cool oven. If 
it be too thias. to drop, let it stand a night. 

ORANGE SHERBET. Dissolve a 
pound and half of sugar in a quart of very 

!)ure water ; take nine fine oranges and two 
emons; wipe them well with a napkin, and 
having grated the most fragrant rinds, squeeze 
on them the juice of these fruits; sweeten 
this juice with tlie above sirup, run the whole 
through a close hair sieve, and finish in 
tlie usual way. (See Sherhet.) 

ORANGE SHRUB. Put ten pounds 
of crushed su^r to two galbns of water, 
and boil it until the sugar be dissolved ; skim 
it well, and put it into a tub ; when quite 
cold, pour it into a barrel ; add three quarts 
of Jamaica rum, and six quarts of orange- 
juice (take care tliere are no pips.) Beat 
up the white of an egg, mix it with tlie 
shrub, and let it stand for a week ; then 
draw it off and bottle it. 

ORANGE SUGAR. Rasp on a piece 
of suear die rinds of the liest oranges, but 
■6 lightly tliat not a parttcls of the white is 1 



mixed with it; enrapeoffthesuriiMtftk

and the sugar dried in the same inaiiaer. 

9RANGES, GREEN. Scrape oat the 
insides of tlie oranges quite clean, dies let 
them lie for three days in cold water, ch»f>

ORG 



itjf and Ir»B font poniMb of ingar to ptrU, 
men add three'qinrteni uf a pound of fresh 
onuige-flowen picked, and boil them once ; 
then take the pan firom the fire, and let it 
«tand for two hours, after which, rq;>lace it 
OD the fire ; when it has had about a dozen 
boilings, pour jt through a sieve into anoth- 
er saucepan, boil the sirup to Haae, and 
pat it aside; when quite cold, hottle it. 
The flowers may be used as follows: put 
them into powder-eugar, with which rub 
them well with your bands, till quite dry, 
then sift and put them in a stove. 

ORANGE-FLOWER WATER. Put 
into a still ten pounds of fresh gathered or- 
ange-flowers, and six quarts of pure river 
-water; take particular care to cloee up all 
the apertures of die still perfectly, and set it 
on a moderate Gre, that the ebullition may 
not be too strong ; be particular in cooling 
it frequently, or, at least, whenever the wa- 
t^ in the boiler becomes loo warm, chnnge 
it, and put in fresh ; much depends on the 
attention paid to this part of tlie operation. 
From the above quantity, three quarts of 
orange-flower water may be drawn. 

ORANGE-FLOWER DOUBLE 
Water. Draw four quarts of orange- 
flower water from six quarts distilled as 
above ; put to this water the same quantity 
of fresh flowers, distil it in the same manner, 
and it will yield five pints. 

ORANGE PEEL TO CANDY. Take 
some ordnge pee), and let it soak in seve- 
ral waters till it has lost its bitterness, then 
boil it in a solution of double-refined su- 
gar in water, till it becomes tender and 
transparent. 

ORANGE PEEL TO PRESERVE. 

Cut the oranges in halves, take out the pulp, 
put the peel in strong salt and sprins water, 
to soak for three days, repeat tins three 
times, then put them on a sieve to dry; 
take one pound of loaf susar, add to it one 
quart of spring water, boil it, skim it until 
quite clear; let the peels simmer until they 
are quite transparent; dry them before the 
fire; take loaf-sugar, with just sufficient 
"water to dissolve it; whilst the sugar is 
boiling, put in the peels, stirring continually 
until all die sugar is candied round them, 
then put them to dry either before the fire 
or in an oven, and when perfectly dried, 
pot them by for use. 

ORGEAT. Blanch a pound of sweet, 
and twenty-four bitter almonds ; pound them 
to an exceedingly fine paste, adding water 

25 



occasionally to prevent tlieir oiling; mhca 
gallon of water, two pounds of sugar and 
orange-flower water, with this paste; beat 
them together for some time ; then strain h 
two or Uiree times through a jelly-bag, etir- 
ring it with a spatula, and ierve it in de- 
canters. 

ORGEAT PASTE. Pound the aknonds 
with a little orange-flower water to a fine 
paste, and then work up with it an equal 
weight of powder-sugar. This paste will 
keep a long while, and by dissolving a small 
portion of it in water, and straining it, or- 
geat may be prepared very quickly. An 
ounce of the paste is sufficient for half a 
pint of water. 

ORGEAT SIRUP. Take a pound and 
a half of sweet, and half a pouud of bitter 
almonds, throw them into boiling water, and 
leave tliem till the skins can be renioved 
with ease, then throw them into cold water 
for a minute before you blanch them, after 
which, they must again be put into cold 
water; then pound tliem, a few at a time, 
in a marble morbu*, adding occasionally 
some water to prevent their oiling; when 
all are beaten to a very fine paste, dilute this 
with the greater part of a quart of water, 
(of which reserve six ounces); put the 
paste into a strong cloth ; squeeze and wrii^ 
out all the milk from the almonds, put the 
latter into the mortar, and pound them 
again, adding by degrees the remainder of 
the water, and then squeeze these also in a 
cloth; pour the whole of this milk into a 
matrass, large enough to contain, at least, 
one-third more liquid, add to it two pounds 
of lump-si^ar, and a pint of oi'ange-flower 
water; cork the matrass tight, and set it 
on a bain marie; when the susar is com- 
pletely dissolved, (which should be accelera- 
ted by shaking the matrass occasionally), les- 
sen tnc fire by degrees, and as soon as the 
vessel is quite cold, put tlie sirup into bottles. 

If you should have no matrass, you may 
make your sirup in the following manner: 
boil the alx>ve mentioned quantity of sugar 
to forte plume, then add the milk of al* 
monds, and as soon as it has boiled up twioe^ 
take it from the fire ; when cold, flavw it 
with a pint of orange-flower water. 

Or this sirup may be made in a still more 
simple way, as thus: put the milk of al- 
monds into some pounded sugar, without 
being clarified or boiled previously; when 
the sirup begins to boil, add about a cofiiee- 
cupful of orange-flower water, and after it 
has boiled up two or three times, take it 
from the fire; let it get quite cokl before 
you bottle it. Keep it well corked.

PARPAIT AMOUR. Take four twy 
fine fresh cedrats, pare than ver^ thin, rim 
infuse tlietn with half an ounce of fine cinna- 
mon, and four ounces of coriander, in three 
gallons of strong brandy, and a quart of wa- 
ter, for a week or ten days, when distil it 
in the bain marie; this quantity of brandy, 
if good, will yield two gallons and half a 

Kint of spirit. Dissolve three pounds and a 
alf of sugar in seven pints of river water, 
color it with cochineal, then add it to the 
spirit, filter, and bottle it. 

PASTILLES. To make these articles, 
it is necessary to have a small cop})er stew- 
pan that will hold about a pint, rather deep 
than wide, with a pointed lip on the right 
side, and a tolerably long handle, also two 
pieces of wood, one about eighteen inches 
long, and four in* diameter, called the bois 
a tabeller, the other about half the length, 
one inch in diameter, and the lower end, 
pointed so Uiat it will exactly fit the lip of 
the pan ; this is called the 6ots a egoutter; 
six or eight tin plates about the size of a 
^eet of fetter-paper. 

For the best paatiileij take a pound of 
double-refined sugar reduced to an impalpa- 
ble powder ; sift it through a tammy on a 
sheet of white paper, put four or five spoon- 
fuls of this sugar into your pan, pour on it a 
little orange-flovver water, and beat it well 
witli the larger stick, until the preparation 
is sufficiently thin to run from the stick 
without being clear ; if it be so, more sugar 
must be added. Put the pan over a chafing- 
dish filled with live coals, and let it stand 
(stirring constantly) till it boils; then take 
it off 1 he chafing-dish, add two more spoon- 
fuls of sugar, work it up well, scrape away 
whatever sugar adheres to the stick, set it 
aside, and take the smaller stick in your 
right hand, bold the pan in your left (slant- 
ing) over one of the tin-plates; the sugar 
will, by these mealis, flow to the lip, then 
strike the point of the strck into the lip of 
the pan, which action will separate the 
liquid, so that each time the stick strikes 
the lip a single drop of the preparation will 
fall on the tin ; a little practice will be ne- 
cessary before this operation can be perform- 
ed neatly. As soon as all your sugar, &c. 
is used, repfenish the pan and proceed as 
above directed, until you have as many 
paBtilles as you may require. When cold 
and hard, remove them from tlie tins witli 
your hand, and keep them in boxes in a 
dry place. You may, if you please, color 
the pattilles, taking care to perfume them 
with a corresponding; odour. 



PASTILLES, OOMMOlf. These are 
made in the same manner as tbe best sod, 
the difference consists in the materiali, 
(wbich are a quarter of a pound of powder 
to three-quarteni of a pound of Bi]^;ar) afll 
tbe perfumes are omitted. 

PASTILLAGES. Pot two omices of 
well-washed gtim dragon into an earthen 
pan, with as much clear hot water as wfll 
cover it, lay a slieet of paper to keep oat 
the dust, and let it stand twenty-fiwr boon; 
then squeeze it through a coarse doth info 
a marbfe mortar, and add to it as much 
starch and sugar (both in powder) as the 
ffum water will contain ; ponnd tliese ingre- 
dients well, and strain them through a tamn^ 
into a pan which keep covered with a damp 
cloth. This pastillage is used to fomi the 
ornamental parts of pastry and confection- 
ary, such as temples, baskets, 8tc., and om^ 
be tinged of the requisite shades, hytabL- 
ing with it any of the colorii^ materials. 

•PEACHES IN A COMPOTE. C* 

your (leaches in half, take out the stones, 
peel them, then set them on the fire in a 
sugar-pan, with a sufficient quantity of thick 
clarified sugar to cover them, and let them 
simmer in this gently till done ; then fake 
them out in a basin, put in tbe kernels to 
the sugar, and let it boil until tolerably thick ; 
put in the juice of two or three lemons, and 
pour the sirup over the peaches; serve them 
in a deep hot dish. 

PEARS IN BRANDY. Take some 
beurre pears, not too ripe, put them into a 
saucepan with a sufficient quantity of water 
to cover them, set them on the fire, and let 
tliem simmer, but not boil, until the pears 
will yield to the pressure of your finger; 
then change them into cold water; pare 
tliem with the greatest care, so that not a 
single spot may remain ; prick, and put them 
again on the fire in fresh water and the joioe 
of a lemon; let them boil verj^ fast. As 
soon as the pears are soft enoogli ibr dK 
head of a pin to penetrate them easily, take 
them out carefully with a skimmer, and hej 
them in cold water. In the meantime, bal- 
ing boiled your sugar to litse, pour the 
boiling sirup on the pears, ([ffeviously 
drained from the water,) and leave tliem. 
The next day drain off the sirup, boil it to 
la nappe, then pot in the pears, give them 
a boil also ; proceed in the same manner on 
the third day, after which, drain tbe frait, 
and put it into botdes. Boil op the sirup a 
few more times, let it cool, and then potf 
on it some brandy, (three-lburths of the 
quantity of the sirup;) ran tbe mixton 
through a bag, put it to the pears, and coik 
the bottles well.

jpounds of small peaiv and four pounds of 
Migar; put the pears into a saucepan with 
a little water, set it on the fire ; when tlie 
limit is soft, take them out, pare, quarter, 
and core them ; as you do this, throw each 
piece into a>ld water, in another saucepan, 
and when all are done, set them on the fire. 
As soon as they are sufficiently soft, rub 
them through a sieve, and havmg in the 
meantime chvified and boiled the sugar to 
petit li$$e, pour the sirup to the pulp, set it

then take it off, put it mto pots, Imd when 
cold, tie them down. 

PERSICA. Cut about one hundred 
peach leaves, put them into a wide-moutlied 
tx>Ule, pour on them a quart of the best 
brandy, cork it close ; in three weeks strain 
it off, and put to it an equal quantity of ca- 
pillaire. It is good in custards, puddings, 
and as a liqueur. 

PINE APPLE CHIPS. Pare and 
trim a pine-apple, divide, and slice each 
half into pieces a quarter of an inch thick ; 
take half the weight of the fruit in powder- 
augar: lay the slices in a basin, with sugar 
«trewed between ; let it stand till tlie sugEU*

to simmer till tlie chips be quite clear, when 
set it fay. The next day remove all the 
sirup from the slices, place them on glasses, 
and dry them in a gentle oven. 

PINE APPLE IN A COMPOTE. 
Turn off the rind of a pine, cut it in slices, 
bat not too thin ; have some sugar on the 
fire in a sugar-pan, into which put the slices 
of pine, and let them boil gently till the sirup

and la^ it on a dish ; mix with the sugar, 
the juice of a couple of lemons, and pour it 
ova* the pine. 

PISTACHIO MARCHPANE. Put a 
pound and a half of pistachios into a mortar, 



pound them, moistening with white of eg/f^ 
to a very fine paste; in the meantime clari* 
fy the same quantity of si^gai*, boil it to petit 
boule; then lake the pan from tlie fire, put 
in the pistachios, stir them together well, 
replace the pan on hot ashes, continually 
stirring, till the paste is of a proper consis- 
tence, then puur it on a slab well sprinkled 
with sugar; as soon as it is cold, cut it into ' 
whatever forms your fancy may dictate. 

PLUMS, IN BRANDY. Take twelve 
poumis of fine magnum bonum plums, and 
three pounds of sugar ; tlie fruit should be 
turned in cuIch*, but not ripe ; prick, and put 
them mto a saucepim with cold water, set 
tliem on the fire; when the water boils and 
the plums rise, take them out carefully with 
a skimmer and put them into a pan of ocUd 
water; clarify and boil the sugar to petit 
liseey put the plums to it, and give them a 
bull; die two succeeding days, drain off 
and boil the sirup, first alone, and aller- 
wards with the fruit; the third day dii^in

boil tlie sirup to la naj^e, and when cold, 
add to it three*fom-tlis of its quantity of the 
best brandy, stir it well, strain and pour the 
mixture over tlie plums. Cork the bottles 
tight. Green-gage plums are done like 
apricots. (See Aprieote in Brandy,) 

PLUMS CANDIED. Choose your 
fruit of a nice shape and good size; cut 
tliem in halves, lay them on a large shallow 
disli, strew powder-sugar over, and put 
them into a moderate oven, tightly closed; 
in half an hour's time, lake them out, and 
place tlie plums one by one on glass plates 
to dry. 

PLUMS, CLEAR CAKES OF. FiU 
ajar with the white pear plums, set it in a^ 
saucepan of boiling water on the fire ; when 
sufficiently done, let the clear juice run 
from it, and to every pint of it, add an equal 
quantity of sugar, boiled to candy height; 
put the juice to the sirup, set it on the fire, 
and keep stirring it till the whole is quite 
hot, but not boiling; then pour it into glass- 
es, and dry the cakes in a stove. 

PLUMS, MARMALADE OF. Take 
six pounds of plums, and four pounds of 
sugar; stone, and put the fiiiit into a cuU 
lender, beat it through with a wooden pestle 
into a piieserving-pan, which set on the fire, 
to dry the pulp, stirring it constantly. In 
the meantime, clari^ and boil the sugar to 
petit caeee, then mix it with the fruit (still 
on tlie fire,) stir it till the whole is of the 
consistence of jelly, then take it off, and 
pour the marmalade into pots. 

If the plums are not quite ripe, they must

marmalade. 

PLUMS PRESERVED, DRY. Gath- 
er the ploms wlien fill) grown and just lum- 
ing color, pi ick and put them into a sancepan 
of cold water, aet them on the fire until the 
water is on the point of boiling; tlien take 
diem out, drain and boil them well in some 
clarified sugar, let them settle, and then boil 
them again ; if diey shrink and will not take 
die sugar, prick them as they lay in tlie pan, 
and tlien give tliem another boil, skim and 
set them nv: the next day, add some more 
sugar, boiled to aoufftty to the fruit, and 
sirup, then do them together; place them 
in a stove till next day, when drain the 
plums from the sirup, sprinkle a little pow- 
der-sugar over, and dry tliem in a stove. 

PJ.UMS, PRESERVED LIQUID. 

Gather the plums green, firm, and when the 
stone m;iy be extracted with ease, cut the 
stalks close, and prick the fruit in several 
places, especially round the stalk; then 
place them in a saucepan of water over the 
fire, and as soon as tlie water is ready to 
boil, take the saucepan from die fire; in 
four-and-twenty hours, replace the plums in 
die same water on a gentle fire, with a small 
quantity of verjuice to preserve their color. 
Keep the water hot, without allowing it to 
boil, for three hours, stfirring it occasional- 
ly ; when the fruit is perfectly green, increase 
the heat till the plums rise to tlie surface, 
when they must be taken out and thrown 
into cold water, which change frequently till 
the plums are perfectly cold, tlien drain 
them. Put the fruit in some susar boiled to 
la nappe, boil them up a few times, adding 
a little water; skim, and then pour the 
whole into a pan ; tlie next two days, drain 
off the sirup, and increase the degree of 
boiling each day ; the third and fourth days, 
boil the fruit with the simp, keeping them 
covered, and increasing the degree, until the 
last time, it reaches to perle. Put the 
preserve into pots, and place them for two 
days in a stove. 

The same fruit may he preserved dry 
also. Tlie operation is the same, hut the 
sirup is drained off, and the plums laid on 
tin plates before they are put into die stove. 

POMEGRANATE CLEAR CAKES. 
Pare some good boiling apples, and put tliem 
into a saucepan with as much water as will 
cover them, set diem on the fire, and when 
perfectly soft, press the pulp through a sieve, 
and then strain it. Boil this jelly witl) the 



juice of two or three p omeg i a nrfici, ttoft tf 
one orange, and one lemon, and the rmdof 
each ff rated; strain it again, and to cfcrf 
pound of jelly add a pound and a quarter 
of fine sugar, boiled till it eracfcs, color it 
with cochineal ; pour it into gliimts (lakng 
off the scum before it becomes cold). Set 
them in a stove, and when tbc top ie dry, 
turn tliem out, and put thenn to dry agam; 
dien cut them into whatever fonm yoa 
please, put them into the stove or ovea to 
harden, then lay them on sieves, and wheo 
thoroughly dry, place them in boxes with 
paper between. As they are apt to beoone 
moist, they sliould be looked at freqaently. 

POMEGRANATE JELLY, TRANS- 
PARENT. Take the seeds from five 
very fine pomegranates, from wfaidi extract 
the juice by pressing it hard through a 
horse-hair sieve; filter this juice and mix it 
with some sirup tinged of a rose color, with 
a little cochineal ; add the isinglass to this, 
and finish as usual. (See JeUy Friut.) 

POMEGRANATE SIRUP. Take 

five very ripe large pomegranates, extract 
the seeds (which must be very red) ; orosby 
and put diem into a skillet, with half a 
pint of water ; set thein on the fire tiH soft, 
and tlieu squeeze tlie juice through a new 
coarse cloth ; clarify a pound and lialf of 
sugar, and boil it to souffle, then add the 
juice, boil tliem together to the iisohI coin 
sistence of sirups. It must not be bottled 
until quite cold. This number of pome- 
granates will yield a quait of simp. 

POUPELIN. Put into a saucepan ibor 
glasses of water, a, quarter of a pound of 
butter, the zeate uf a lemon, and a prach 
of fine salt ; set it on tlie fire, and as soon 
as it begins to boil, take it off, and put m 
as much sifted fiuur as will iimke a paste 
the consistence of choux, then r^ace it 
qn the fire, and keep stirring till it dries ^ 
make* a similar mixture, and wlien that 
also is dry, put both into a mortar, widi 
half a pound of powder sugar, an ounce of 
orange-fiowers, and two e^s at a time, on- 
til five and twenty or thirty are used, by 
which time the paste will lie of die proper 
consistence, then pour it into a lightly but- 
tered tin ; put it into a moderate oven, and 
leave it. In three hours' time, if the 
poupelin is of a nice gold color, take it 
out, cut off tlie top, and widi a spoon re- 
move all the inside, then set it in the 
oven to dry. When cold, spread all over 
the interior apricot marmalade, on whidk 
strew sweet macaroons crushed, then ton 
it on a dish, and serve.

QUINCE CAKES TRANSPARENT. 
Take a quart of sirup of quinces, and half a 
pint of the sirup of barlierries ; set ihem on 
a gentle fire, boi and skim them welt ; then 
aikl two pounds and a half of fine sugar, 
keep stirriag until it renrJies candy height ; 
then take it off, and when nearly cold, lay 
It, in any form you please, on tin plates. 
Dry them in a store.

RASPBERRY CAKES. Gather some 
rasplierries before they are quite ripe, pick, 
and lay them in a stove to dry ; then beat 
ihem in a mortar. Take a pound and 
quarter of fine sugar, clarify and boil it tu 
eaue ; then weiffli half a pound of raspber- 
ries, dried as above; throw them into the 
sirup, with half a spoonfiil of white of c^, 
beaten in cream; stir it carefiiliy, give it a 
boil, and pour it in moulds or paper cases. 

RASPBERRIES OF MARCHPANE. 
Take a pound of marchpane, the juice of 
four lemons, a quarter of a pound of rasp- 
berry jelly, and a little cochineal; mix these 
together with a strong wooden spatula ; then 
ami two handfuls of Hour, and some powder 
sugar; when well worked up, roll them into 
pieces about the size of a finger, cut these 
into dice, roll each into a bull, pinch the 
top into a point, so as to resemble the form 
of a raspberry: then put them one by one 
into paper cases, which place in a dry 
warm place, for eight or ten days. At the 
end of that time, put a portion of sirup of 
raspberries, a little cochineal, and a small 
Quantity of powder-sugar into a pan ; mix 
them together with a spoon, and then tlirow 
into it a couple of handfuls of the raspber- 
ries ; take the pan in both hands, and shake 
it about, so that the raspberries may be 
equally covered with the red sirup; then 
put sugar a la grele on a large sheet of 
paper, spread it out a little, and while the 
raspben'ies are wet with the sirup, throw 

25* 



then into the •ngnr; then take thft fear 
corners of the paper, shake it about well, 
by which means the sugar will adhere to 
the raspberries in ail parts, and give diem 
a p^fect resemblance to' the real fruj*; take 
them out carefully one by one, lay liiem on 
paper, and put them in a warm place for 
some da}'s. 'Hiese artificial raspberries are 
of a pleasant flavor, and will keep several 
yeara. 

RASPBERRY MARMALADE. Take 
double the weight of rasplierries to that of 
sugar. Rub the fruit through a sieve, and 
put the pulp into a saucepan ; set it on the 
fire, and stir till it is reduced to half ; then 
poor on the sugar, previously clarified and 
boiled to petit boule, stir it well in, put it 
on the fire, give it a few boils, and then 
pour it into pots. 

RASPBERRIES PRESERVED. Take 

five or six pounds of red, but not too ripe 
ra^pl)errie8, pick, and put them into a pre- 
serving pan, with an equal weight of clari- 
fied sugar, boiled to petit boulej when 
they have boiled up about a dozen times, 
skim, and pour the whole into a pan till the 
next day, then drain die fruit, and put it 
into jars; put to tlie sirup about two glass- 
es of cherry juice, previously strained ; boil 
the sugar to la nappe^ and then pour it 
over the raspberries ; add afterwards, about 
a spoonful of currant jelly to each pot, and 
when cold, lay on brandy papers, and tie 
them down. 

RATAFIA OF FOUR FRUITS. Taktf 

ten pounds of very ripe cherries, two pounds 
and a half of raspberries, five pounds and a 
half of red and two pounds of black cur- 
rants; pick, and mix these fiiiits toother, 
press the juice from them, measure it, and 
for every quart of juice, take half a pound 
of sugar, and an equal quantity of brandy; 
dissolve the sugar in the juice, then put in 
the brandy, a drachm of mace, and two 
drachms of cloves. Let the whole stand 
some time, filter, and bottle it. Keep them 
well corked. 

RQSES, CANDIED. Crisp two hand- 
fuls of rose-leaves in some clarified sugar, 
boil them to fort souffiey then take the pan 
fi-om the fire, pour it on a sieve, let the sir- 
up run from the leaves, rubbing the latter in 
your hands, then dry them in a stove. Boil 
your sugar again to soti^e, adding a little 
carmine to color it, have a pro|)er mould 
ready, pour the sugiir into it, and put the 
flowers on it, push them down lightly with 
a fork, that they may be completely cover- 
ed with" the sugar; place the mould in a 
moderate stove or oven for fire days, then

ROSES, CONSERVE OF. Boil half 
a pound of sugar to fort touffle, pour into 
this sirup the best doobie-distilled rose 
water; Irnil it again to fort perle, mix 
with it a little preparetl cochiueal or car* 
mine to color it, and pour your conserve 
into moulds. 

ROSE RED DROPS. Take a small 
quantity of red bastard saifroii, and u little 
calcined alum, boil tliese in some water until 
it is sufhciently tini^ed for your purpose; 
then filter or strain it thropgh a very close 
linen cloth ; put five or six spoonfuls of sift- 
ed sugar into the pan, dilute it with the 
colored water, work it well witii the boit a 
iabelleTy and set it over a chafing-dish ; when 
it b^ins to boil, add two more spoonfuls 
<^ sugar, and having worked it well, per- 
fiwie it with some drops of essence of roses, 
and finish as directed. (See Orange'JUnO' 
er Drop*.} 

ROSSOLS. Take three-quarters of a 
pound of picked orange-flowers, a pound 
of musk roses, six drachms of cinnamon, 
and two of cloves (both bruised); put them 
into a cucurbite with three galbns of pure 
water; on distilling this, it will yield a gal- 
km and a half, in which dissolve twelve 
pounds of fine sugar broken up; add to it 
an equal quantity of spirit of jessamine, col- 
or it crimson with cochineal, filter and bot- 
tle it. 



S. 



SEEDS, SUGARED. These are done 
in the same manner as sugared almonds. 
The seeds most generally used for this pur- 
pose are anise, cummin, and fennel. 

Hie best method of proceeding is as fol- 
k>W8: place a small preserving-pan over a 
charcoal fire, on the side of which have a 
chafing dinh, on which keep a pan with a 
qwmtity of sugar boiled to li9»e; (this su- 
ear should be kept quite hot, but not boil- 
ing) ; on the other side have some fine pow- 
der. When so far prepared, put your seeds 
into the pan, and as soon as they begin to 
heat, pour over them a large 8{)oonful or 
two of the sirup; stir them about, that all 
may be thoroughly saturated with it ; then 
sprmkle over it a handfiil or two of powder, 
still shaking the pan to make the seeds 
equally white. When dry, pour on some 
more simp, then the powrler, and continue 
this alternately until your seeds are suf- 



finientfy laf|te; then lay them oh ft meiCf 
keep tliem in a waim place Sat atmtm da^ 
afto* which put them into ^ass bottles. 

SOUFFLE FRANCAIS. MAS a 
ermutade eleven inches in diameter, mnd 
three ami three-quarters in height; pot 
round it tliree sheets of buttered paper, and 
hake it. 

Take twelve glasses of boiling milk, in 
which infuse wliatever ingredients you maf 
think proper, such as vanilla, oofi^, anmgt* 
flowers, &c. (tlie proportions will be fomd 
under tlie different articles). In the mean- 
time, wash a pound of rice thoroi^bly in 
warm water, then put it into a iouce|ni» 
of cold water, and whm it has boiled a few 
minutes, strain the rice, and put h with 
your infiision into another saucepan, and 
set it again on the fire; a» soon aa it boik, 
place the saucepan on hot ashes, that th» 
rice may burst gradually ; io three-^narteiv 
of an hour, add a pound of powder-sugar, 
three-quarters of a pound of fre^b batfter, 
and a pinch of sah, stir them well in; |mt 
fresh hot ashes under the aauoepan, that die 
rioe may be kept constantly eimmering iat 
an hour, by which time it ought to be per- 
fectly sofl, and shoukl be robbed lhroag[b a 
boitmg-cloth quickly, like a puree; put thia 
into anotlier saucepan over hot ashes, to 
keep it warm. Take sixteen eegs, 
rate the yolks and whiles, beat me f 
well, and whisk the latter till nearly firm; 
then mix the yolks with the rice (takmg 
off the ashes) ; the preparation ought to he 
of the same consistence as a creaoi paH9» 
eierei add, at first, a quarter, and after* 
wards the whole of the whitea; stir them m 
as lightly as for biscuit paste; the whole be- 
ing thoron^ly amalgamated, pour it iato 
the erouBtade, and place it in a moderate 
oven for two hours and a half; when dooa^ 
cover a baking tin witli red cinders, om 
which place tlie eouffU the mcHiient h i» 
taken out of tlie oven; this prevents ita 
falling, whilst you mask it witli powder- 
sugar, and glaie with the salamander; car- 
ry it into the dinii^nroom on a tin, Imve a 
dish ready with a napkin ioMed on it; 
place the eovffle on tiie dish, and let it bt 
sen'ed immediately. Remember that a 
eouffle cannot be served too quickly. 

STRAWBERRY, COMPOTE OF. 
This is made in the same manner as Raa|>> 
berries, only that the etrawberrtea do not 
require being mixed with any other firait. 

STRAWBERRY CONSERVE. Tak» 
some very ripe fresh strawberries, pick, aad 
crush them through a tammy. For evoy 
dessert spoonful of juice, allow six oanees 
of sugar; boil thw to fort perU, take k

serve begins to whiteo and dry, then put it 
into moulds or paper cases. If the oonoerve 
lie loo tvhite, add a litde carmine to the 
iirap. 

STRAWBERRY MARCHPANE. 

Take two ponniis of sweet almonds, two 
pounds and a half of sugar, and a pound of 
picked strawberries. Beat the almonds to 
a fine paste, and mix them with tlie sugar 
(boiled to petit bouU;) crush, and strain 
the juice of the fruit, whidi add to the al- 
mond paste and sirup ; stir the mixture well, 
■et it on hot ashes, and continue stirring until 
the paste is sufficiently done; tliis may be 

EDved by laying a piece on die Imck of your 
nd; if it may be removed without its 
sticking, it is eiiiaugh ; when cold, spread it 
over a sbib, and cut it of any sixe and sliape 
yon think proper. 

SUGAR, TO CLARIFY. Take four 
poawk of sugar, and break it into pieces; 
fMt into a preserving-pan the white of an 
eggf and a glass of pure spring water; mix 
tbeaa well widi a whisk, add anotlier glass, 
■till whipping, until two quarts of water 
have been put in ; when the pan is full of 
froth, throw in the suffar, and set it on the 
fire> being carefiil to cSiim it every time the 
■earn rises, which will be the case as the 
sugar boils up. After a few boilings, tlie 
eugarwill rise so high as to run over the 
edges of tlie pan, to prevent which, throw 
OB it a little cold water ; this will lower it 
lastaotly, ahd give time for the skimming, 
Ibr the scum should never be taken off whilst 
the sugar is Iwbbling; the cold water stills 
itf and that is the moment to skim it. Re- 
peat this operation earefiilly three or four 
times, when a whitish light scum only will 
rise; then take the pan off, lay a napkin, 
slightly wetted, over a basin, and pour the 
sQBir through it. 

The scum thus taken off, put into a china 
basin ; and when the sugar is clarified, wash 
the pan and the skimmer with a glass of 
water, which put to the scum, and set it 
aside for more coaunon purposes. 

SUGAR* Different Degrete of Pre^ 
pmring. The various purposes to which 
sugar is applied, require it to be in different 
stales; these are called degreee, and are 
thirteen in numlier, called as fi>llows: 

Petit Lieee, or Firet Degree, Re- 
place the clarified snsar in the preserving- 
pan, to boil gently, take a drop of it on the 
tbnmb, tourh it widi the fore*finser; if, on 
opening iliem, it draws to a fine thread, and 
in breaking, furms two drops oo each finger, 
it is at the rigitt point. 



Ldetet Second Degree, A little room 
Imiling brings it to this point; when the 
dniead will draw fiirther beifore it breaks. 

Petit Perle, 7'hird Degree. At this 
point the thread may be drawn as fitr as the 
span will open, without bi'eaking. 

Grand Perle^ Fourth Degree. On 
still incmising the boiling, little raised baUs 
are funned on tlie surfiice of the sugar. 

Petit Queue de Coehon^ Fifth Degree, 
Take up some of the sugar on a skimmer, 
and drop it on the reiit, when it slioidd form 
a slanting streak on the surfiice. Boil it a 
little longer, and it will reach the 

Chrande Queue de CoeiMn, or Sixth 
Degree. Tlie streak or tail is now larger. 

Souffle y Seventh Degree, Take out a 
skimiiieiftil of the ragnr, blow through it, 
and smalt sparks of sugar will fly from it. 

Petit-Phmey Eighth Degree, The 
same fM-ciof as above ; die sparks should be 
lai^r and stronger. 

Grande Plume, Ninth Degree. Take 
tlie sngar in the skimmer, as before, give it 
a sliake, and if the sparks are large, and 
adhere together on rising, it is at the right 
point. 

Petit Boulety Tenth Degree. Dip 
your fingers in coM Mrater, and then imo 
the sugar instantly, and again into the wa- 
ter, when tlie sugar will roll into a baU, 
which will be supple when cold. 

Groe Boulety Eleventh Degree. At 
tliis point, the ball or bullet will be faardsr 
when cokl than at the last. 

Casee, Twelfth Degree. Prove as 
above; the bullet shouki crumble betweea 
the fingers, and on biting, will stick to the 
teeth ; at the next point, 

Caramel, Thirteenth Degree^ It 
should snap clean. This point is very diffi* 
cuU to attain, for in increasing the height, 
the sugar is apt to bum ; it is better there* 
fore to try the proof very frequently. 

Another caramel is fueqnently used bj^ the 
confectioner, and is of a deep cokir ; it is 
made by putting a little water to the sugar, 
and boiling it without skimming, or other- 
wise touching die sugar, till of the right 
cokn*, then take it off and use immediately. 

If, on preparing the sugar, you happen to 
miss the right pomt, add a little cokl watSTt 
and hoi I once more. 

Obeervatione. — The skimmer shouhl 
never be left in the preservinff-pan after the 
sugar is clarified, nor after the scum is re- 
moved. 

Be very careful not to stir or disturb the 
sugar, as tlmt wouki cause its diminutimi. 

In boiling the sugar (particularly the two 
last degrees), tlie sugar is continually rising 
and fnlling; and on falling, leaves marks oa 
the sides of the pan, which the heat of the 
fire wovkl soon bura, and thereby spoil the

•whole of the ngar; to avoid this, have by 
the side of you a pan of cold water, and a 
■ponge, with which wipe the sides of the 

Sn carefiikiy, the instant after die sugar has 
leo. 

SUGAR LIKE SNOW. Blanch a 
quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, potmd 
tneni to a very fine paste in a marble mor- 
tar, with the whites of four egn; when 
perfectly smooth, add a pound of the best 
lump sugar (in powd^"), and five or six 
more whites of eggs ; stir ail leather well, 
until of such consistence that it may be 
kneaded without adhering to the hands. 
Divide this preparation into two parts, one 
of which, tinge of a reil color, eitlier with 
6o/tts armejui, or cochineal, and perfume it 
with essential oil of roses or her^mot; 
leave tlie other portion of paste white, but 
flavor it as follows: — gi^ate the rind of two 
fine sound lemons on a small piece of sugar, 
•crape off the sur&ce, and when pounded in 
a small mortar, work it into the uncoiored 
portion of 8ugai*-paste, then roll it out to about 
naif an inch in thickness (having previously 
sprinkled the slab widi powder-sugar,) cut 
it with a tin-paste cutter about two inches 
diameter; arrange them on white papa*, 
which place on a baking tin, and put them 
into a moderate oven fur about three-quar- 
ters of an hour ; proceed in the same manner 
with the colored paste. When cold, detach 
tbein from the paper. 

SUGAR PASTE. Take a pound of 
flour, a quarter of a pound of sugai', a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter, a little salt, one 
egg; mix all togetlier with a little water. 
This paste may be used for any second- 
course dish. 



T. 



TABLET OF PATIENCE. Take 
eight eggs, and whip the whites to a firm 
■now; in the meantime have the yolks 
beaten up with six ounces of powder-sugar ; 
(botli these operations should be performed 
for at least half an hour) ; then mix the two 
together, add six ounces of sifted Hour, and 
when well incorporated, pour in half a pint 
of rose or orange-fiower water; stir the 
whole together for some time. Have ready 
some tin plales, well rubbed with butter; 
take a funnel that has three or four tubes, 
fill it with the paste, and push out your 
tablets; when the tin plates are full, put 
them into a prettv warm oven. Wlioi done, 
take them from the tins whilst hot.

sen'e it cold. 

VANILLA CRMM, BOLTED. 
Take as much cream as will fill tlie inoald 
you intend to iifle» and boil it up a few 
times, with the proportionate quantities of 
vanilla and sugar; then let it cool, and if 
the mould will contain a qaart, mix twalwe 
yolks and three whole eggs with the cream, 
and run it five times through a bohin^ cloth. 
Butter the mould, pour the cmun into it,
