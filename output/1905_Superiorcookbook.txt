Beets in Jelly. 

Boil small beets about the size of half an egg, and if none as small are at hand 
cut larger ones into slices after thev are cooked. ^Vhen they rub off easily the beets 
;ire done. After cooling place them in an earth.en mold. 

Make the jelly from o level talilespoons of sngar, o level teaspoons of arrow- 
j'oot. S cup of vinegar and ] vu]) of boiling water. Cook until (dear, which will take 
about o minutes. I'oui' the mixture round rhe beets ami cool. When taken from 
the mold the liects will show through a cidmson jelly. 

If ])referred arrange the heets in a clear glass dish and cool. The sour jelly 
will be found appetizing with the heets. Flour cannot lie used in place of the 
arrowroot, because it would give a cloudy jelly: c«uaistarcli is better, but arrowroot 
makes almost as clear a jelly as gelatine. Mrs. J. S. Wood.

Rules for Making and Baking Cake. 

Have the oven readv to mrivc the cake as soon as it is mixed. Tlie oven can 
wait a few moments for tlie cake: the eake can never wait for tlie oven. The coarse- 
ness of cake is frequentlv due to its standing for a moment before going into the 
oven, or tlie oven not being at the right temperatviro wlien tlie cake goes m. 

Cakes without butter require a quick oven. 

Cakes with butter require a moderate ovt-n. 

Cookies or small cakes reciiiire a inoderatelv (|iiick oven. 

Calces containing molassses recjuire careful watching in a moderate oven, as they 

scorch easilv. . 

If your cake browns as soon as you put it into the oven, the oven is too hot; 
cool it as quickly as possible by lifting tli" lid of the stove, or stand in the oven a 
quart pudding-pan filled with cold water. 

Never move a cake in the oven until the centre is thoroughly '"set.-"' If you jar 
it it will become heavy in the centre and near the bottom. This is due to the break- 
ing of the cells. 

To trv a cake put vour oar down near the pan; if the cake ticks loudly put it 
back, as it is not done.' If the ticking is very faint or absent it is done. Take it 
from the oven. l)ut do not handle it while hot. 

It is always well to line cake-pans with greased paper, to prevent Inirning at the 
bottom. 

Flour should always be sifted three times before using. 

Sift baking powder and cream of tartar with flour three times. 

Bright tins best for baking caki'. Always grease witli butter. 

Cream butter and sugar until very light. If sugar and Inittcr cream slowly, 
add a little of the measured milk. 

Soda should always Ite dissolved in a ver^■ little hot water and stirred thor- 
oughly into the sour cream, milk oi- molasses, and added to mixture before the flour.

Heaps with unsparing hand." 

- ISIii/ros. 



Suggestions. 

'IMuTC is no 'Vfoyal road" to nice {innn's. To liavc tlieiii the housekeeijer must 
take tiuio and tfoiihk'. Tlie rieliest juices of any fruit lie immediately under the 
skin and around tlie core. Here also is tlie o-elatint)US principle without which the 
fruit cannot jelly; and by jjaring your fruit for jelly you lose the best part of it. 

For currant, grape, asti'achan aj)|)le jelly use one cup of sugar to one cup of 
juice, lioil the juice thoroughly, then add the sugar and cook until it jellies from 
the s])oon. 

For all kind-^ of berries that will form their own juice, use one cup sugar to 
1 (piart of fruit. This will fill a pint can. 

Raspberry and Currant Jelly. 

Boil 2 cups ras|)berri(-- and I cup cui-rani^ .^ lioiii-. then strain and take 1 cup 
juice to 1 cu]> sugai' and boil -j-'i minutes: seal when cold. 

Mrs. W. J. Stromvall. 

Raspberry Jelly. 

Boil the berries with ^ cup of water. 20 minutes, pour into coarse linen bag 
and let it drip until cold, then press it liard. .\llow 1 cup sugar to 1 cup juice. 
Then put juice on the stove first until it boils up, then skim it, heat the sugar in a 
dish in the oven and add it as tlie juice boils uj). boil 20 minutes and pour it into 
tumblers. Mrs. Geo. Thonet. 

Crabapple Jelly. 

Wash and f[uai-tcr large crabs, c(M'er to the depth of 1 inch or 3 with cold water, 
and cook to a mu-li : |)our into a coarse cotton bag and when cool enough press and 
extract all the juice. Take a piece of fine muslin, wring out of wafer, place over a 
crock and with a cu]) dip the juice slowly in, allowing time for juice to run 
through; repeat 'this process twice rinsing out the muslin frequently. Allow the 
strained juice of 4 lemons to a peck of fruit and f of a pound of sugar to 1 pint of 
juice. _ Boil the juice 15 to 20 minutes, wliile l)oiling sift the siigar in slowly, stirring 
constantly and boil 5 minutes longer. This is generally sufficient, hut it is always 
safer to try it. This makes- very clear and sparkling jelly. Putting a piece of sliced

How to Make Cranberry Jelly. 

Wash and ])ick one quart of cranberries; j)ut them into a kettle with 1 pint of 
v.'ater. Cover the kettle, bring the cranberries to boiling point, put them through a 
colander, pressing out as much of the flesh as possible. Add to the cranberries 1 
])ound of sugar. Stir over the fire until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture 
reaches the boiling point. Turn at once into moulds and stand away to harden. 

For cranberry sauce simply add another 4 pint of water and boil the mixture 
for about 5 minTites. This boiling will invert tlie sugar and the mixture will re- 
main soft. 

Delicious Rhubarb Jelly. 

Cut rhubarb into pieces an inch in length, and then place it in a dish with 
a cupful of sugar, 1 of water, a little ginger root and lemon peel, and bake until 
the rhubarb is tender. Put some pink gelatine to soak : soften over hot water ; 
strain into the rhubarb; add the juice of a lemon. Pour into a mould and chill.

Take currants freshly picked, stem and wasli. To every cupful of currants

Fruit Canning "California Method." 

To everv j)0und of fruit add a pound of .-ugar, mash line in an earthen jar with 
a wire potato masher, then pack in glass jars; seal up, and wrap each, can in paper 
to exclude the light. Fruit with tliis method is so much more delicious than when 
cooked, as cooking destroys the delicate flavor of many fruits, especially straw- 
berries. I have given this reeijx' a thorough test and it has proven very satisfactory. 
Be sure and trv it. ^Irs. J. S. Wood.

Recipe For a Good Digestion. 

Poor Di<jestion eind Good Humor are seldom fouud in intimate association, 
while Good Digestion and Good Humor usually go hand in hand. To appreciate 
this volume ot substantial and dainty recipes, one should have a good digestion. 
H your's is not g-ood you should entice it by cultivating Good Humor. One of the 
best means of cultivating- Good Humor is to have your photog-raphic work done at 
Childs Art Gallery. This, in itself, is enough to put almost anyone in g-ood 
humor, but if there is anything- still lacking- to complete the metamorphosis, buy 
a Premo Film Pack Camera. We have sold many dozens of these Cameras and 
have yet to see the purchaser whose countenance was not radiant with delight 
when'he saw the result of his first successful effort. The melancholly individual 
whose dig-estion does not brace up under this treatment, is no company for him- 
self or anyone else, and he mig-ht as well get his boots blacked and start on his 
Celestial journey without further delay.

Candies. 



"lIowt'viT full, witli .sonulliing- more. 
We fain till' batr would cram." 



General Directions. 

Use best grainilated sugar lor boiling and Conrcctioncr's XXX for kneading. 
Candy sbonld not Ije stirred Avhile boiling. 

Fondant. 

One cup granulated sugar, i/;. cup boiling water. Put the sugar in a saucepan, 
add the boiling water and stir until dissolved. Place over the lire and with a clean 
damj) cloth wipe the cr_ystals off the sides of the pan so they will not fall into the 
syrup Avhile it is boiling; do not stir it after it commences to boil. Test the candy 
by dropping a little syrup into cold water; if it fornis a soft ball it is cpoked enough ; 
each time when testing remove the saucepan from the fire. Pour it onto a platter 
or marble slab and let it stand until cool, then stir with a spoon until the mass be- 
comes white and creamy. Gather it into a ball, scraping uj) all the crumbs, and 
knead until smooth. Stand away in a cool place until ready to use it. 

Note. — This fondant is the foundation for many different kinds of candy. It 
may be colored and flavored to suit the individual, working both flavoring and color- 
ing in with the hands. It may then be used as a tilling for dates — the seeds having 
been removed — or rolled into various shapes and English walnuts j^laced on top. It 
is better to make a small quantity at a time, as there is less danger of its being 
grainy. Mrs. Graff. 

Oranges Dipped in Fondant. 

Make the fondant as previously directed, flavor with orange extract and color 
a pale yellow. Kemove the skin from a Tangerine or Mandarin orange and care- 
fully divide it into the sections without breaking the membrane. Melt the fondant 
in a bowl over boiling water, and if too thick add a little boiling water until it is the 
consistency of thick cream. Dip the sections of the orange quickly into the fondant, 
covering them well, remove and place on waxed paper to harden. Use white grapes 
or cherries in the same way. These are nice as a sweet for a yellow luncheon. 

Mrs. Graff. 

To Cover Chocolate Drops. 

Place 1/2 pound of fondant in a saucepan; add Vi pound of grated chocolate and 
a teaspoonful of vanilla. Stand this in boiling water and if, when melted, it is too 
thick to use add boiling water, a teasjjoouful at a time, until the consistency of thick 
cream. Mrs. Graff.

Kerosene oil is tlie best of furniture polisbes. It cleanses, makes a fine polisb. 
and ] (reserves from tbe ravages of insects. 

Here is an excellent floor polisb, tbe recipe for wdiicli conies from Japan: To 
1 pt. of linseed oil add a ])t. of strong cold tea, 2 ozs. of spirits of salts and tbe wbite< 
of 2 eggs. Mix tborougbly and ])our into a large bottle. Sbake tbe bottle well be- 
fore applying tbe ])olisb. Pour y-> a teaspoonful on a mo]) or pad of old silk and 
rul) tbe wood witb it. following up tbe grain. Polish with an old silk bandkercbief. 
Tbe result will compensate for tbe tedious and careful labor necessary. 

Use kerosene for blood stains. Wash colored cottons and linens as (juickly as 
possible, dry in tbe sbade and take olf tbe line as soon as dry. 

Xever sun featber beds or 2)ilb>\\s. Air tbem tborougbly on a windy day in a 
cool ]ilace. Tbe sun draws the oil and gives tbe featbers a rancid smell. 

To remove a refractory screw from wood beat a piece of iron red bot and bold 
it on top of the screw for a minute or two; then the screwdriver will easily take 
out tbe screw if used wbile tbe screw is warm. 

The cleanest way to dri\'e water bugs or roac;hes from bureau draM'ers or closed 
shelves is to sprinkle powdered borax over and around tbe shelves and cover witb 
clean paper. 

Keep a boM'l of oatmeal on the wasbstand. and after washing the bands drv 
them in the meal. Tbe skin will be kept MJiitc and smooth, and less lial)le to chap 
by this process. 

Half a teaspoonful of sugar will nearly always revive a dying lire, and it is 
always a safe thing to use for this purpose. 

To destroy ants in pantry or refrigerators: Tjay small pieces (or pulverized) 
(•am])hor around in small quantities. 

To remove paint from glass: llwh with silver dollar. Clean jnarl)le in same 
way. 

To clean combs and brushes: Wash thoroughly in. wai'iu water, to which a 
teaspoonful of cooking soda has been added: dry quickly. 

To clean kettles and frying pans from Imi'iit vt'getahles or meat: Pour in 
water cold, add teaspoon of soda, let i)oil bard. 

Take a newspaper folded and wax thoroughly, use on ironing talde. Will keep 
irons smooth while ironing starched clothes. 

Always soak linen over night to take out coffee or cream stains and to take out 
berry stains pour through boiling water before wetting. 

To wash cambric or ginghams without fading: Take 2 tablespoons of salt, 
the same of turpentine. ]Tut in a ]>ail of cold water. Soak articles 2 hours then wash 
in bot suds.
