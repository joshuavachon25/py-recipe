INTRODUCTION. 



FOR nearly six thousand years, one of the choicest, most 
healthful, and most nutritious articles of food that was 
assigned by the Creator for man's diet, has been but little 
used, at least by the civilized portion of the world. 

This long-neglected article of diet some call " shell fruit," 
but the common name is "nuts." "And God said, Behold, 
I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the 
face of all the earth, and every tree yielding seed ; to you it 
shall be for meat." Nuts, which are only the shelled fruit of 
a tree or seeds of a plant, are certainly included in man's 
original bill of fare. 

It is indeed strange that man should so lightly esteem and 
refuse to partake of these choice, God-given viands, which, 
judiciously used with grains and fruits, would supply all 
nature's requirements, and turn from the healthful diet to 
that which is less wholesome and more liable to disease - 
such as flesh meats of all kinds. The probable reason for 
this is, first, they are usually eaten as desserts after one has 
already eaten a sufficient amount, or they are eaten as titbits 
between meals, and then, if indigestion follows, the nuts get 
the credit. Secondly, they are somewhat hard of mastication, 
and very few people of this generation have teeth sound 
enough to masticate them sufficiently for easy digestion. 

Historians and travelers tell us that the natives of Africa 
and British Guiana, also the North American Indians, use nuts 
as one of the principal articles of their diet. Missionaries 

[5] 



O INTRODUCTION. 

who have lately returned from these lands, inform us that the 
natives still use nuts in the preparation of their foods; and 
that with their crude utensils, they can grind and emulsify 
nuts nearly as well as the more modern perfected machinery. 

A little over fifteen years ago, the German army began 
experimenting quite extensively on the use of peanuts as an 
article of diet for the army, and at the present time, there are 
annually many thousand tons of peanuts exported from this 
country to Germany and France. They extract the oil and 
make the residue into flour or meal, and apportion it to the 
soldiers. It is made into soups and other foods, and con- 
sidered very nutritious. 

In the last few years, there has been a great awakening in 
regard to healthful living, and great strides have been made 
in the methods of emulsifying nuts into a paste or butter, - 
a convenient form for cooking purposes and much easier to 
digest. But the majority of those who have adopted nut 
butter, use it instead of the dairy product only to spread 
on bread. It is the object of the author to place before 
the public a book treating upon the use of nuts as short- 
ening, seasoning, etc., to be used in every way in which milk, 
cream, butter, or lard can be used, and fully to take their 
place. 

To the best of the author's knowledge, there has hitherto 
been no book which treats upon this subject. The recipes 
are those which have been carefully tested by the author or 
some of her friends. 

Perfection is not claimed in this work, but it is sincerely 
hoped that this book is only a forerunner of other and better 
works on this subject, and that further experiments will bring 
out other and more valuable recipes.

NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 



ALMONDS. 

THE name of this nut is supposed to be derived from the 
word ainysso, meaning to lacerate, on account of the 
prominent, sharp, knife-like margin of one edge of the nut. 
The English name is from the Latin amandola and from the 
Greek amaygdale. The almond tree is a tropical evergreen, 
and was originally a native of Barbary and Morocco, but is 
now widely cultivated throughout the warmer temperate 
zones of the Old World, and also in California and in the 
southern United States. 

Botanically it belongs to the Rose family, Rosacece. In 
most of our modern botanical works, it is classed as a sub- 
section of Prunus, the plum. The plum, peach, and almond 
are generally considered to be only varieties of one species. 
Our cultivated peaches and nectarines are undoubtedly de- 
scendants of the wild almond tree. However, they differ 
greatly in the size and color of the blossoms as well as the 
shape and size of the leaf. The almond blossoms are usually 
somewhat larger than the blossoms of the peach, and of a 
pale rose color, appearing in early spring before or with the 
unfolding leaves. The leaves are three or four inches long, 
tapering and finely serrate. The fruit of the almond, like the 
peach, is covered with a soft, velvety down; but the pulpy 
envelope becomes dry and fibrous at maturity, cracking open 
and allowing the rough, deeply pitted, and wrinkled nut to 
drop out, while in the peach, the pulpy envelope becomes 
soft, juicy, and edible. The plum is only a peach with a 
smooth skin.

GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

" As with most of the long-cultivated fruit and nut trees, 
very little is known of the early history or origin of the 
almond, and even its native country has not been positively 
determined, although it is supposed to be indigenous to north- 
ern Africa, and the mountainous regions of Asia. Theo- 
phrastus, who wrote the history of plants three centuries 
before the Christian era, mentions the almond as the only 
tree in Greece that produces blossoms before the leaves." 

The almond thrives throughout the Mediterranean coun- 
tries both in Europe and Africa, and has long been exten- 
sively cultivated. It forms an important article of commerce, 
immense quantities being exported from Spain, mostly from 
Valencia, while the so-called Jordan almond comes from 
Malaga, as very few are raised in the valley of the Jordan. 

The almond ranks high in nutritive value, and is highly 
esteemed for culinary purposes, being employed in the prepa- 
ration of numerous dainty and appetizing dishes for the table. 
In the countries where the almond is grown, it is considered 
a dainty dish to serve in the half-open green husks ; in this 
state, the kernels are just passing from the milky stage, and 
are more easily digested than they are when fully ripe. But 
those found in the markets are fully matured, and have been 
thoroughly dried before shipping ; most of them are already 
shelled, as labor is much cheaper in those countries where 
they grow, and the shipping expense to this country is less. 

The sweet almond contains fifty-three per cent, of fats, 
twenty-three and five-tenths per cent, of albuminous elements, 
seven and eight-tenths per cent, of starch, and three per cent, 
of salts, making a total nutritive value of eighty-seven and 
three-tenths per cent. 

The rough brown skin which covers the kernel of the 
almond is bitter, and somewhat irritating to the stomach. 
This should be removed by blanching.

When formed into an emulsion, they are considered an 
excellent medicine for persons suffering with diabetes and pul- 
monary disorders. Almond oil is a standard article in the 
stock of druggists, entering into the composition of various 
kinds of powders, paste, syrups, and cosmetics. But the 
most important use is to take the place of dairy milk and 
butter. 

Almonds are usually divided into three groups ; the soft, 
or paper-shelled, the hard-shelled, and the bitter. There are 
many varieties of each group, although they are generally 
called by the name of the group to which they belong. 

Soft, or Papcr-slicllcd Almonds.-- In this group there are 
many varieties, the most common being the widely known 
sweet-kerneled, thin-shelled nut. It is one of the oldest in 
cultivation in European countries. The blossoms are pale 
rose in color and very large. 

Hard-shelled Almonds.- - This variety differs from the pre- 
ceding only in the hardness of its shell and its hardiness to 
endure the cold. It can be grown where the peach can, and 
is very productive. Its shell is quite firm and smooth, but 
deeply pitted. The kernels are fully as large as the paper- 
shelled, and equally valuable for food. 

Most of the names of the different varieties are the names 
of the country or city from which they were exported. The 
Sicily almond from Sicily, Valencia almond from Valencia, 
while the Jordan almond comes from Malaga, a very few 
being raised in the valley of the Jordan. 

Bitter Almonds.-- As regards the shell, this class is not 
distinct from the other two, as some have soft and some have 
hard shells ; but the kernels are very bitter, and contain a 
poisonous acid, known as hydrocyanic, or Prussia, acid. 
Although it is often used as flavoring in confectionery and 
cake, it is unsafe to do so. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY.

The kernel of the sweet almond varieties does not contain 
this poison, but it is found in their leaves and bark. 

BEECHNUT. 

The Latin and bo- 
tanical name for the tree 
is feigns, and was de- 
rived from the Greek 
word p k ago , which 
means to eat, alluding 
to the fact that the nuts 
have been considered 
good eating by the in- 
habitants of the coun- 
tries where the beechnut 
grows. Botanically, it 
belongs to the Cupnlif- 
erce, or Oak family. 
The flowers appear in 
the spring, with the 
straight-veined and ser- 
rate leaves. The calyx 
of the sterile flowers are 
bell shaped and five 
cleft, containing many 
stamens. 

The fertile flowers 
appear in pairs on the 
summit of a scaly bracted 
peduncle. The seed- BEECHNUT LEAF, BUR, AND NUT.

very similar to the American beech, excepting its leaves are 
broader, but not so long and pointed. The trees are usu- 
ally large, with smooth ash-gray bark. 

The early writers of Greece and Rome frequently refer to 
this nut. Vergil and Pliny speak highly of the beechnut as an 
article of food. Pliny informs us that at the siege of Chios, 
the besieged inhabitants lived upon the beechnut alone for 
some time. 

There are many species of the bee' u , but thev are all 
similar, some having larger leaves and nuts +hat others. 
Among them are the following : the Americai :h, the 

European beech, and the Evergreen beech. Th- 1 -hnut is 

quite small, and hard to gather, making it unproi 1 ~ to 
gather them for sale. For this reason very few of +b?n re 
sold in the markets. 

The beech-wheat, more commonly Ji buckwh 

so named on account of its kernels ha' ^ Tie shape of the 
beechnut. The kernels are small ai d ^A-k-brown color, 
on the outside, and three-sided, but in ^ ^tion it is more 
like ordinary wheat. Q^' . 

In the forests, the beechnut affords tc jr many wild 
animals and birds. The nut contains considerable oil, and 
i y have experimented on extracting it for salads and cook- 
in , purposes. Formerly beechnut oil was made in France in 
c :isiderable quantities and used for frying fish and as a 
urvssing on salads. The country people of Silesia use it 
i- ;tead of butter, and that which remains after the oil is 
.ken out, they feed to swine, poultry, and cattle. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 



BRAZIL-NUT. 

Brazil-nuts are also called Para-nuts and cream nuts. They 
are the triangular edible seeds of a South American tree, 
belonging to the Myrtle family (Berthollctin c.rccssa). 

The tree attains a height of one hundred to one hundred 
and fifty feet, and the trunks are three to four feet in diam- 
eter. The leaves are broad, smooth, and about two feet long, 
thick and leathery : The fruit is 
globula a form and from four to 
six inch. aa^ieior, with a brit-

The Brazil-nut is indigenous to 
Brazil, Guiana, and Venezuela, 
and southward to Rio Janeiro. 
They form immense forests in the 
valley of the Orinoco and Ama- 
zon. There is an inexhaustible 
supply, the only difficulty is in getting them to the seapoipj 
towns. They are principally exported from Para. They ar 
rich in fats, having fifty-seven per cent. 

A very superior oil can be obtained from these nuts b\ 
pressure, but at the present, their principal use is in dessertr 
and confectionery.

CASHEW NUT. 

This is a tropical American shrub or small tree, belonging 
to the Cashew family, or Anacardium occidental. It is now 
naturalized in Africa and Asia. 

The tree is an evergreen, 
with entire, feather-veined 
leaves. The flowers are small, 
sweet scented, and of a reddish 
color. The fleshy pear-shaped 
receptacle in which the ca- 
shew nuts are borne, is some- 
times called the cashew apple. 
The fruit is kid- 
ney shaped. The 
nut proper is en- 
closed in a leath-

consisting of two 
layers, between 
which is a caus-

this is eliminated 
by heat, so that 
when the kernels are roasted they have a pleasant flavor, 
and are highly esteemed for desserts. Care must be taken 
in roasting the nuts, as the fumes given off during this opera- 
tion cause inflammation of the eyes. The nuts also yield 
an excellent oil. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 



CASTANOPSIS, 

The name of this tree was derived from Castanca, the 
chestnut. It is an evergreen tree intermediate between the 
oak and the chestnut. There are several varieties in the Old 
World and in 
the islands of the 
sea, but only one 
in this country, 
and that is on 
the Pacific Coast. 

W here the 
climate is moist, 
the castanopsis 
becomes a large 
tree from fifty to 
one hundred feet 
high, with a 
trunk from two 
to three feet in 
diameter, but in 
the dry regions 
of California, it 
is a mere shrub. CASTANOPSIS BUR AND KERNEL. 

C. S. Sargent, in his work entitled " Woods of the United 
States," says as follows : " This handsome broad-leaved ever- 
green tree is indigenous to the elevated regions, 
from Monterey, Cal., northward to the Col- 
umbia River in Oregon. 

" It is also common in the Sierra Nevadas 
at elevations of six thousand feet, but in its 
southern limits rarely below ten thousand feet 
elevation." 





CASTANOPSIS

I 8 <U T IDK FOR NTT COOKERY. 

The leaves are oblong-lanceolate, growing from one to 
four inches long. The fruit is enclosed in an involucre, or 
bur, covered with stout, divergent spines from one-half inch 
to one inch in length. There is usually only one nut in a 
bur, but several burs grow on one twig. 

The nut is small, conical in form, slightly triangular, 
with a firm, brittle shell, not fibrous like the chestnut or 
acorn. The kernels are sweet and the flavor excellent. 
They are greedily eaten by birds as well as squirrels. The 
nuts do not ripen the first season, but stay on the trees 
through the winter, and become fully matured about the 
middle of the next summer. 

CHESTNUT. 

The chestnut belongs to the Oak family and to the group 
C 'nsfanca. The sterile flowers cluster in long catkins, and 
appear in the axils of the leaves. The fertile flowers are 
near the base of the last sessile catkin, from one to seven in 
3. cluster, having a calyx from four to six lobed, crowning 
the three- to seven-celled ovary, which becomes a scaly, 
prickly bur. 

The chestnut is a tall-growing tree. Travelers describe 
the monarchs of Etna as being trees of immense size The 
Roman writers who have written on rural affairs, mention the 
chestnut as a valuable food-producing tree, but Piiny, who 
describes several varieties of the chestnut, seems to place 
more value upon the timber than on the nut. There are 
three principal subdivisions : the European chestnut, the 
American, and the Chinkapin. 

The European variety has long, lanceolate, pointed eaves, 
smooth on both sides, and much thicker than the leaves of 
any other variety. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. I 9 

The burs are very large, covered with long, branching 
spines. The nut shell is thick and tough, and of a dark, 
mahogany-brown color. This variety is characterized by the 
kernels being wrapped in a tough skin that is intensely bitter. 

There are many varieties of this group, among them the 
Japan chestnut, the Numbo, the Paragon, Ridgely, Comfort, 
Cooper, Carson, and many others. 




OPEN BUR OF THE RIDGELY CHESTNUT. 

The European chestnut has been so frequently and ex- 
tensively referred to by ancient and modern authors that it 
would not be at all difficult to fill a large volume with brief 
extracts from their works. All who have had any experience 
with it admit its value as food for many wild and domestic 
animals, as well as for the human race. 

The European chestnut is much larger than those indige-

nous to America, and many have tried growing them here ; 
but only a few have succeeded in making them grow, though 
after they are once started they are quite hardy. There are 
a few nice groves of the Japan, Numbo, and Paragon chest- 
nuts, species of the European variety, growing on Long 
Island and in New Jersey. 

The American chestnut has oblong-lanceolate serrate 
leaves, smooth on both sides. The bur, which usually con- 
tains three nuts, is thickly covered with long, branching 
spines, becoming woody, and opening by four valves. 

The nuts have a dark-brown shell, which is tough and 
leathery. The kernels are fine grained and sweet. The 
trees are common in the Middle and Northern States ; they 
grow very large and live to a great age. Some of the varie- 
ties of this group are the Burless and the Hathaway. 

The Chinkapin is the smallest of the chestnut family ; 
its leaves are broadly oval, coarsely serrate, pale green 
above, and silvery white below. The burs are in long 
racemes, covered with long, branching, sharp spines, contain- 
ing only one, top-shaped, glossy-black nut in each bur. The 
kernels are sweet. Fuller's Chinkapin, common Chinka- 
pin, and the Bush Chinkapin, are in this group. 

The chestnut ranks high in nutritive value, containing 
eighty-nine per cent, of nutrition, fourteen and six-tenths 
per cent, of albuminous element, sixty-nine per cent, of 
starch, two and four-tenthsper_cent._of fats, and three and 
three-tenths per cent, of salts. 

As they contain so much starch, they are more easily 
digested if cooked before being eaten. For more than a 
thousand years, this nut has been an important article of diet 
for the poorer class of Southern Europe. In some of the 
mountain districts, it is almost the staff of life. Chestnuts 
are not only used in their raw state, but are boiled, roasted,

and even dried and ground into flour, which is made into a 
coarse but nutritious kind of bread. 



CHUFA (EARTH ALMOND). 

Chufa is a grass-like plant, indigenous to the countries 
bordering on the Mediterranean Sea, and cultivated for its 

nut-like, sweet tu- 
bers, called Chufa 
or Earth Alrn- 
onds. 

It belongs to 
the Sedge family 
(Cypcracenc), and 
botanically is 
called C y p c r jt s 
Escutciitus. The 
leaves resemble 
coarse marsh 
grass. The plant 
produces small , 
oblong tubers in 
abundance, which 
are rich in fats 
and very sweet, 
tasting like the 
almond, but hav- 
ing a better flavor. An excellent milk may be made from 
them, which can be used for shortening. 

They can be easily grown, by planting them in drills like 
peas. Seed Chufa can be obtained at Ruckbee's seed store, 
Rockford, 111. These nuts generally go by the name of 
Chufus, or Earth Almonds. 




CHUTA NUT. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 23 

COCOANUT. 

The cocoanut is the largest edible nut in our markets, and 
is very widely known. It is sold in the markets with the 
outer husk removed, but with long, bristly fibers adhering to 
the very hard, thick shell lined by the white meat, which sur- 
rounds the watery fluid called cocoanut milk. They a.e large 
in size, ranging from six to twelve inches long, and three to 
six inches in diameter. They are borne on lofty tree-like 
palms (Pahiuc or Palinacac), which are natives of Africa, 
India, and the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 
They grow sixty to ninety feet high, and have pinnate leaves 
from ten to twenty feet long. The nuts hang at the base of 
the leaves, in clusters of from eighteen to twenty. This tree 
yields cocoanuts, drink, fuel, and clothing, and is the most 
useful of all trees, thriving only near the seacoast, or where 
the sea breezes reach it. 

The natives eat this nut in its immature state, when the 
flesh is soft and very much like a delicious custard. It can 
be eaten from the shell with a spoon. In this stage it is very 
easy of digestion ; but when it becomes mature, it is quite 
woody, and hard of digestion. In this country it is princi- 
pally used for flavoring, and for its oil, in which it is very 
rich, containing thirty-six per cent, of fats, eight per cent, of 
albuminous material, and one per cent, of salts. 

The oil consists of a peculiar substance called cocinin, a 
combination of fatty acids and a very small quantity of olein. 
The cocoanut-oil is liquid at eighty degrees ; below this tem- 
perature, down to fifty degrees, it is of the consistency of 
lard ; and below that temperature it is quite hard. Under 
pressure, the oil separates, forming not only a liquid but a 
solid substance. The solid portion, called "cocoa stearin," 
is manufactured into a butter called "cocoanut stearin," and 




COCOANUT.

NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 

used for lubricating the skin in giving massages, etc. The 
stearin is also used for making candles. The cocoanut-oil is 
utilized in manufacturing toilet and fullers' soaps. 

There is a company in the United States that manufac- 
tures a butter from the cocoanut which they call " Nutcoa. " 
It is of a clear, whitish color, and is composed wholly of fats. 
It is better for cooking purposes than for table use, although 
it is finding its way to the tables of the poorer classes as a 
substitute for oleomargarin. It is, of course, free from tuber- 
cular germs, by which so many of the cattle of this country 
are afflicted. 

In countries where they are indigenous, cocoanuts are 
used in many ways. The young and tender sprouts are 
cooked as we would prepare asparagus. A cream is made 
by grating the cocoanut fine, and rubbing it well with the 
hands in as warm water as possible. The oily part, perfectly 
emulsified, rises to the surface, and is poured off, leaving the 
coarser part to settle to the bottom. Cocoanut cream is 
excellent on grains, or for seasoning other foods. The oil 
can be made by grating and rubbing like the above, and then 
boiling for an hour or more in plenty of water. When cold, 
the oil will rise and the woody portion will settle to the bottom. 

The husk, or fibrous pericarp of the cocoanut, is termed 
"coir," and is used in various ways. Coir is prepared by 
soaking the husks for several months in water, and then beat- 
ing with heavy weights. Coir yarn is imported into America, 
and is preferable to horse hair for stuffing mattresses, cush- 
ions, chairs, and saddles, as it is indestructible and never 
harbors vermin. It may also be made into very strong, light 
rope, formerly of great value to seamen, as it floats in water 
and is unaffected by it. Coir is also made into mats ; and 
the twisted and braided fibers are used by the Polynesians in 
the place of nails in the construction of houses and canoes. 



26 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



The small and immature nuts are grated fine while green, 
and used for medicinal purposes. A healing salve may be 
made from the unripe nuts, by mixing with the oil of the ripe 
nut. The trunks of the trees are used for building purposes. 



FILBERT, OR HAZELNUT. 

The hazelnut is a bush or small tree, belonging to the 
Oak family (Cupulifcne), producing edible nuts of a dark- 
brown color. The staminate flower appears in the autumn, 
in cylindrical catkins, remaining on the plant all winter, and 
becoming fully developed to shed their pollen early in the 
spring. The pistillate flowers appear very early in the spring, 
before the leaves, during the warm days of March or April. 
The bright red stigmas push through the ends of the buds, 
dropping off as soon as fertilized. The tree may then remain 

without leaves for several 
weeks. 

All the varieties which 
have long, fringed husks

The filbert has been celebrated from ancient times, both 
in prose and poetry. Vergil says it has been more honored 
than the vine, the myrtle, or the bay itself. Formerly a 
forked twig of the hazel was used as a divining-rod for finding 
hidden treasures, veins of metals, subterranean streams of 
water, and even pointing out criminals. 

There are many varieties ; the two principal ones being 





the American and European filberts.

GROUNDNUT. 

The groundnut is a tuber of a widely distributed climb- 
ing plant, common in low, wet grounds, almost everywhere, 
from Canada to Florida, and westward to the Mississippi. 
This plant is described in most of the botanical works of the 
present day under the name of Apios Tnbcrosa, and belongs 
to the Pulse family (Lcgntninoscic). It is a perennial twining 
vine, with pinnate leaves and dense racemes ot small, brown- 
ish-purple, pea-shaped flowers. The subterranean rootstocks 
bear long strings of edible tubers, which are round, some as 
large as walnuts, and some a great deal larger. They are 
dark-brown on the outside, but white within. When boiled 
or roasted, they have a rich, farinaceous, nutty flavor. 

HICKORY-NUT. 

The hickory-nut belongs to the Juglandacctf, or Walnut 
family, and to the group Carya. Of this there are several 
varieties: The Carya Oliru'fonnis, (pecan-nut), Alba (shell- 
bark or shagbark), Sulcata, (Western shellbark), Tomcntosa 
(mockernut, or white heart hickory-nut), Amara (bitter- 
nut), Poreina (or pignut), and the Aquatica, or water hick- 
ory. Among these, the first two are the most valuable for 
the nuts, although the other varieties are quite as good for 
timber. 

The sterile flowers are in long, cylindrical catkins, three 
in a cluster, on a common peduncle ; the leaflets are sessile or 
nearly so, of from five to thirteen leaflets. The nuts are 
globular, or short oval, sweet, edible, and enclosed in a husk 
which opens by four valves. The shellbark, or shagbark, is 
considered the best variety for eating purposes; it is so called 
on account of the bark of the trunk being shaggy and sepa-

rating in rough strips. The nuts are variable in size, mainly 
thin-shelled and white ; the kernels are large, sweet, and 
excellent ; it is one of the most popular of nuts, the demand 
being almost unlimited. 

The Western shellbark differs from the preceding, in 
having a lighter-colored wood, the leaves more downy, and 

the nuts larger, measuring two 
inches long, and pointed at 
both ends. The kernels are 
smaller in proportion to the 
size of the nut than in the pre- 
ceding, but are easily removed 
from the shell. 

The variety known as the 
Hales hickory has the thin- 
nest shell and plumpest kernels 
of any of the hickories. The 
shell is not much thicker than 
a pecan shell, and has no sharp 
ridges running from the base to 
Wi STERN SHELLBARK HICKORY. tne po i nt as [ n ot h er varieties. 

The mocker hickory-nut and others of similar kinds, have 
smaller nuts, with thick, hard, shells ; though sweet, they 
are small, and very difficult to remove from the shell, and on 
this account, they are of little value. 

The bitter-nut is similar to those of the above variety, but 
the kernels are intensely bitter, but when in the milky state 
are greedily eaten by the squirrels. 

The pignut and water hickory also have bitter kernels. 

The hickory-nut is strictly an American nut, being found 
only on the Western continent. The early white settlers 
found the Indians using the hickory-nut in many ways and 
storing large quantities of them for winter food, sometimes

one family having one hundred bushels. They had no mills 
in which to grind them, but they made them fine by pound- 
ing and putting them into boiling water, working them well 
with a wooden paddle. The oily part of the liquid was pre- 
served and called by a name which signifies "hickory milk." 
It is rich, sweet, and delicious, the fat being in the form of 
an emulsion, like cream. The Indians used it in cooking, 
especially in hominy and corn cakes. As nut foods are com- 
ing into such general use, there may come a day in the future 
when hickory milk will be again in vogue, and be more 
highly esteemed by the civilized people than it was by the 
aborigines. 

LITCHI (LEECHEE NUT). 

The Litchi nut is more of a fruit than a nut. The tree 
grows in southern China and the Philippine Islands, and be- 
longs to the Soapberry family (Sapindaccce). 

The tree grows about 
twenty-five feet high with 
sturdy twigs and branches ; 
the leaves are composed of 
seven oblong, pointed leaf- 
lets. It is said to be one of 
the most popular of Oriental 
fruits. These trees are now 
on trial in Florida, being 

introduced in 1886. 
LITCHI NUT. ,, , 

In the last few years, this 

fruit has appeared in the markets of our large cities, in con- 
sequence of the increased trade w^ith Oriental countries and 
facilities for rapid transit across the continent. 

The fruit is globular in form about one inch in diameter, 
with. a thin, chocolate-brown colored shell covered with wart- 




NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 37 

like protuberances. When fresh, the shell is filled with a 
jelly-like pulp of a most delicious sub-acid flavor, but is 
often rather dry and stale in the nuts before it reaches our 
markets. It has one smooth, brown seed in the center of the 
fruit. 

PEANUT. 

The peanut is the fruit of a trailing plant, botanically 
called Arachis Jiypogcea, which belongs to the bean family 
(Le-guminosce). It is known in different localities as the 
earthnut, groundnut, ground-pea, goober, pindar, jar-nut, 
and Manila-nut. Strictly speaking, it is not a nut at all, 
and should more properly be called the ground-pea. The 
plants are annuals, growing from one to two feet high, with 
thick, pale-green, hairy stems ; some varieties have long, 
spreading branches. The blossom is at the end of a long, 
pedicel-like calyx tube, the ovary being at the base ; after the 
blossom drops off, the peduncle or "spike" with the ovary 
on the end elongates and bends downward, pushing several 
inches into the ground, where the ovaries develop into a pale 
yellowish, wrinkled, and slightly curved pod, often contracted 
in the middle, and containing from one to three seeds. 
Should the spike not be able to thrust itself into the 
ground within a few r hours after the fall of the flower, it 
withers and dies. It is therefore very necessary that the 
ground should be kept as light and porous as possible to. 
insure a good crop. 

The "Farmers' Bulletin No. 25," published by the Agri- 
cultural Department of the United States, treats upon the 
culture of peanuts, and names the following varieties : - 

"The Virginia running variety of the peanut, being most 
widely known and most popular with the trade, may be taken 
as the typical American peanut. Its vines are large, with

spreading branches, growing flat on the ground and bearing 
pods over almost their entire length. The pods are large 
and white, weighing about twenty-two pounds to the bushel. 










I i \.NTT PLANT ('VIRGINIA RUNNING VARIETY). 

"The Virginia bunch variety grows erect and fruits near 
the tap-root, but produces pods very closely resembling those 
above described. 

"There are two varieties in Tennessee, the white and red, 
the white closely resembling the Virginia running variety, and 

the red producing somewhat 
smaller pods with kernels hav- 
ing a dark red skin. This vari- 
ety matures earlier than the 
white, yields fewer pops, or im- 
perfect pods, has a less spread- 
ing habit, and on account of this 
difference in growth is perhaps 
somewhat more easily cultivated. 
KERNELS OF VIRGINIA PEANUT. -The North Carolina (or 

African) variety grown in Wilmington section of the State 
has much smaller pods than those just described, weighing 
twenty-eight pounds to the bushel ; the kernels contain more 
oil than those of other varieties. 




POD OF THE VIRGINIA PEANUT. 




NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 39 

" The Spanish variety has a relatively small, upright vine, 
forms small pods near the tap-root, and can be planted much 
closer together than any of the others, thus producing a very 
heavy crop to the acre. The North Louisiana Station found 
the Spanish a desirable variety, easily harvested, all of the 
pods adhering to the vine. It required a much shorter period 
to mature, and planted as late as July i, matured a full crop 
in that latitude before frost. The pods filled out well, form- 
ing few if any pops. 

"The Georgia red-nut, like the similar variety in Ten- 
nessee, has medium-sized vines growing up from the ground 
and fruiting principally near the tap root, with three or four 
kernels to the pod. 

"These comprise all the varieties cultivated in this 
country, but in Costa Rica there is a variety with long pods, 
without divisions, containing four or rive seeds, and in the 
Argentine Republic a large-sized variety with a deep, orange- 
colored shell. In the Malay Archipelago there are two 
varieties, called the white and brown, resembling probably 
the white and red Tennessee varieties, excepting as to size. 

"The peanut of India and Africa 
resembles the North Carolina variety 
in size, and is raised principally for 
the oil which is contained in its ker- 
nels." The varieties which are usu- POD OF SPANISH PEANUT.

the following names : Spanish (shelled)

sold in the pod, as they are so tight to the peanut that they 
are hard to break open. This variety is considered the best 
for butter-making, although some prefer the Virginia. 

"The Virgina (shelled) peanut is larger than the Spanish

nut, having a stronger peanut flavor, but equally rich in oil. 
These are usually assorted into three grades, the Nos. I and 2, 
and the Extra Large, Hand-picked. The No. 2 nuts are 
small, shrivelled, and split ; they are therefore difficult to 
roast and blanch, and make an inferior grade of butter. 

"Statistics tell us that there are 4,000,000 bushels of 
nuts used yearly by Americans, which cost the consumers 
$10,000,000, and that fully three fourths of this amount was 
sold to venders of the roasted peanut, either directly or 
through jobbing houses, and the remainder and poorer grade 
of the peanuts are sold to confectioners, to be used in the 
manufacture of peanut candy and cheaper grades of choco- 
lates. A small amount is also sold to be made into oil. Thus, 
it will be seen that the greatest part of the peanuts that have 
been used by Americans, has not formed a part of the regular 
articles of food, but are eaten at odd times. 

"The peanut planter makes use of the vine, under the 
name of peanut hay, which is carefully saved and fed to all 
kinds of live stock. They also use the thin skins enclosing 
the kernel, as a fodder. The vines, when plowed under just 
before blossoming, are an excellent fertilizer, and are con- 
sidered better than clover to enrich the soil. The peanut has 
been valued most for the oil which it contains. In the Old 
World millions of bushels of peanuts are being used annually 
for the production of oil, which is considered equal to olive- 
oil, and may be used in every way in which that is em- 
ployed. This oil forms from thirty to fifty per cent, (by 
weight) of the shelled nut. It has an agreeable taste and 
smell and very much resembles the olive-oil, so much so 
that a great deal of the olive-oil sold in the country is 
nothing but peanut oil. 

"During the years between 1861 and 1865, peanut oil 
was manufactured bv at least four mills in the Southern 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 



States, and used as a lubricant by railroads for locomotives, 
by wool and cotton spinners for their spindles, and by house- 
wives instead of lard as shortening in bread and pastry. The 
cake was eaten by many living in the vicinity of the mills, 
and was very highly spoken of by those who used it, as a 
palatable and nutritious food for man." 

Thus we see that over thirty years ago, peanuts were not 
only used as titbits between meals, but also for culinary pur- 
poses. But since the invention of machinery for family use, 
for grinding the nuts into a butter, their use has spread over a 
greater territory. This is partly due to the fact that the 
expense is thus lessened, and not only this, but because the 
nut as it comes from the mill is in a much healthier condition 
to eat, being easier of digestion than the oil or the raw resi- 
due that remains after the oil is taken out. The nut butter 
can be easily mixed with water, forming an emulsion, and by 
thinning it sufficiently, it makes an excellent substitute for 
cream and milk. It can also be made into various nut foods. 

The following is a comparison made by Professor Konig, 
based on the price in Germany of the following twelve prin- 
cipal foods reduced to units of nutrition:-

valley of the Mississippi River and its tributaries as far north 
as Ohio. It is also found very plentifully in Texas. The

many varieties of the pecan varying in size, form, and thick-

names. 

Among the cultivated sorts, the Stuart, Risien, Van De- 
man, Ladyfinger, Early Texas, Georgia Melon, Longfellow, 
and Ribera are some of the best varieties for eating. The 
pecan is very nutritious and in composition is very nearly the 
same as the walnut, to which family it belongs, and is excel- 
lent for shortening cakes, making roasts, or in mince pies.

SAPUCAIA-NUT. 

This is the Brazilian name of a large forest tree growing 
in the valley of the Amazon. Botanically it is called Lccy- 
f/iis Zabucajo and belongs to the Myrtle family. It is closely 
allied to the Brazil-nut, but is superior to that in flavor and 
digestibility. The nuts are produced 
in an urn-shaped capsule about six 
inches in diameter, having a circular 
lid about two inches across, which, 
when the nut-like seeds inside are 
ripe, separates from the fruit with a 
sharp sound giving signal to the mon- 
keys to scramble after the falling nuts. 
For this reason, they are sometimes 
called Monkey-pots. The empty seed- 
vessel is often used for a pot or vase. 

The nuts are packed very closely in 
the shell and are about one inch in di- 
ameter and two or three inches long, 
with a thin, brown, wrinkled, and 
twisted shell. The kernel is white, 
sweet, oily, and has a very nice 
flavor. 

In New York these nuts are sold 
under the name of Paradise nuts, but this is probably a local 
name. These nuts are not shipped in very large quantities. 

SOUARI-NUT. , 

This nut is a native of British Guiana, and is the fruit of 
the Coryocar Nucifcnun, a magnificent tree growing one hun- 
dred feet high, with a trunk two or three feet in diameter. 
Botanically it belongs to the Tea family, but the nut is very

similar to our butternut, which belongs to the Walnut family. 
They are sometimes called butternuts. 

The leaves resemble those of the horse chestnut. The 
flowers are very large, and have a tube fully a foot long, of a 
deep purple on the outside and yellow within. It is com- 
posed of five thick, fleshy petals and is as showy as our 
brightest-colored magnolias. 




SOl'ARI Nl'T. 

The flowers arc produced in terminal clusters succeeded 
by a fleshy fruit five or six inches in diameter. The nuts arc 
affixed to a central axis and are of a round subreniform shape, 
and even flattened to an almost sharp edge on one side. The 
shell is of a deep brown color, embossed, as it were, with 
smooth tubercles. They are from two to two and one-half 
inches in diameter. The kernels are pure white, soft, rich, 
and oily, with a pleasant flavor. This nut is rarely seen 
in our market excepting those brought by sailors to our 
seaport towns. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTnKN. 47 

PINE-NUT. 

The botanical name for the pine is J^iinis, and is derived 
from the Latin word pix picis, which means the tree that 
produces pitch. The nut-pines are those trees which produce 
seed large enough to be conveniently used for food. Of these 
there are many varieties in this country, as well as in Europe. 
In Southern Europe and especially in Italy and France, the 
seeds of the stone-pine (Pinns Pinca] have been extensively 
used as food from the earliest times down to the present day. 
Nearly all of the ancient authors refer to them as among the 
valuable products of the country. 

Macrobins, in his story of the Saturnalia, speaks of the 
cones as Nnccs I'd Poina Pinca. These pine-nuts are called 
Pinoechi in Italy and Sicily, and occasionally a few reach 
this country, but the Italian name has been corrupted into 
Pinolas. 

There are several species in this country bearing large, 
edible seeds. Of the twenty-four species of pine found on 
the Pacific slope and in Arizona, half of them afford seeds 
that are used for food by the Indians. 

The Pinns cdnlis is considered the best flavored of the 
pine-nuts, so named by the late Dr. Kngelmann, because of 
its large, sweet, and edible seeds. It is a small tree, growing 
on dry hills in Colorado and southward through New Mexico 
and western Texas. 

In Arizona and Lower California there are two species- 
Pinns Parryana and Pinus cembroidcs, also called Pifions, 
which bear large nuts. And farther east and north are found 
the one leaf pine (Pinns inonopJiylla), and although the seeds 
are much smaller than those of Pinus cdulis, they were 
formerly gathered in immense quantities by the Indians, to 
help eke out their often scanty winter store of food.

NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 49 

Occasionally a small quantity of pine-nuts are sent to 
Eastern markets, but they are not often sent unless ordered 
early in the season. 

The pine-trees Finns cditlis and J^itins Monophylla are 
perfectly hardy, and worth cultivating for ointment as well as 
for their nuts. 

The pine-nut has a rich, marrowy kernel in a shell that 
varies in thickness from that of a chestnut to that of a hard- 
shelled hazelnut. The form and size of the nuts vary greatly 
in different species, as may be seen on the plate. Pine-nuts 
are but little known to a majority of the people of the United 
States, though they are marketed in large quantities in some 
of the cities of California. Some of them are of good size for 
confectionary and cooking purposes, and in quality and flavor 
are so superior that their general introduction will doubtless 
make them very popular. Pine-nuts are generally harvested 
by Indians, whose method is to heat the cones until they 
open, when the nuts are easily rattled out, having been partly 
roasted in the process. 

The nuts are smooth and white, and unlike most nuts 
there is no skin to remove. They are excellent for shorten- 
ing, as they are very easy to prepare, perfectly white, almost 
tasteless, and very rich in fats. 

WALNUT. 

Juglans is a Latin name contracted from Jovis glans, 
meaning the " nut of Jupiter." It is said that the name was 
first used by Pliny, a Roman writer of the time of Pompeii. 

They are medium-sized deciduous trees, having alternate 
pinnate leaves of from fifteen to twenty-one leaflets. The 
seed-pod is two to four celled, but has only one ovule 
or nut. 




I'.i ARING BRANCH OF ENGLISH WALNUT. 



[So] 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 5 I 

The nuts are round or oblong, with thin husks, which dry 
up without opening ; the shell is either rough and deeply cor- 
rugated, or quite smooth ; in some specie^ quite thick, and in 
others quite thin. The kernel is two lobed and united at the 
apex ; it is sweet, rich, and oily. 




CHILE WALNUT. 

The walnut of commerce is known by various names : 
English, French, Persian, European, and Italian ; also there 
are the Madeira walnut, Chile walnut, and California walnut, 
named from the country in which they grow. 

There are many species and varieties of walnuts. The 
principal ones that are natives of the United States are the 
butternut and the black walnut. Although butternuts differ 
in many respects,-- in the tree, shell of the nut, and even in 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



the flavor of the kernel, --yet it is placed by botanists with the 
walnuts. The nut is covered with a husk which it does not 
shed, but dries upon the deeply corrugated and very thick 
shell. The kernels are sweet and very tender, and oily, but 
are difficult to remove from the shell. For this reason, they 
are not highly esteemed. In composition, they are similar to 

the walnut, but contain rather more 
fat, and are quite as valuable for 
food when once removed from the 
shell. 

The black walnut, botanically 
called Juglans Nigra, grows wild. 
The trees in many parts of the United 
States are large, with smooth leaf- 
lets, which are ovate, lanceolate, and 
serrate. The fruit is spherical in 
form, with hard, thick shells, deeply 
corrugated. The kernels come out 
quite hard, but in some varieties are 
much easier to remove than others. 
When removed from the shell, they 
sfll in market for rather more than 
the English walnut. 

Among the Oriental walnuts, or 
those indigenous to the Old World, 
there are also many varieties, as they have been cultivated 
and improved for so many hundred years. Many of them 
have been planted in the United States, especially in Cali- 
fornia, where they will soon be a paying business. The fol- 
lowing are some of the best-known varieties : - 

The BartJicrc Walnut. - -This is a long nut, pointed at 
both ends, with a thin shell. The kernel is large and the 
flavor excellent. 




BARTHERE WALNUT. 



NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 53 

The Chabcrtc. - -This is an old standard French variety, 
of oval shape, medium sized, and kernels very full and rich 
flavored. 

The Chile Walnut. --This name is given in a general way 
to all walnuts coming from South America. The nuts are 
good sized, thin, but firm shells, with plump kernels, having 
an excellent flavor. Many of the Chile walnuts have three 
valves instead of two. 

The Gant Walnut.- -This is a variety of remarkable size, 
but the kernel does not correspond to the size of the shell. 

The Gibbons Walnut.- -This is a 
very large variety raised in France 
many years ago, but it is of little 
value, as the shell is very thick and 
the kernel small. 

The Mayettc Walnut. A very 
large variety, with a light-colored shell 
of moderate thickness. The kernels 
are plump, readily extracted whole, 

and very sweet, with a rich, nutty flavor. This is an old 
standard French variety. 

TJic Mesangc or Paper-shelled Walnut.- - This nut has the 
thinnest shell of any variety known. The kernels are plump 
and quite rich and oily, but they are more apt to be bad, as 
the shells are so easily broken ; and when the kernel is 
exposed to the air, it readily spoils. 

The Pariscnnc Walnut.- -This variety originated in 
Southern France, but grows well in California. It is a large 
and broad variety and has a thin, but firm shell ; the kernels 
have an excellent flavor. 

The Serotina Walnut.- -This is a very popular variety, as 
it buds late in the spring, escaping the late frosts, and grows 
so rapidly that it is ripe in the fall, with the other varieties.

NUTS AND THEIR HISTORY. 57 

It is medium sized, the shell rather hard, but the kernel is 
plump and well flavored. 

Walnuts have been raised and highly valued from very 
early times. Pliny informs us that the Greeks called the tree 
Caryon, on account of the strong scent of the foliage. It is 
claimed by the early writers of Europe that the emperor 
Vitellius introduced the walnut into Italy. When the plant- 
ing of walnuts was extended into Gaul (Ancient France), they 
were called " Gaul nuts," which the English-speaking people 
corrupted into "walnuts." Walnuts in this age were highly 
prized and considered appropriate only for the table of the 
king. They believed that they possessed powerful medical 
properties, even curing hydrophobia ; but the medical fra- 
ternity of to-day are of a different opinion. The walnut is 
very nutritious, both in fats and albumen, making them an 
excellent nut to use in the preparation of foods. They con- 
tain fifteen and eight-tenths per cent, of albuminous ele- 
ments, thirteen per cent, of starch, fifty-seven and four-tenths 
per cent, of fats, and two per cent, of salts ; making a total 
nutritive value of eighty-eight and two-tenths per cent. 

WATER CHESTNUT. 

These are also known as Water Caltrops. They are the 
seeds of several species of water plants of the genus Trapa, 
of the Evening Primrose family (Onagraceee). 

There are several species of these nuts. In Southern 
Europe there is a species called Jesuit nut. In China, they 
are called Ling, and are extensively used as an article of 
food. In India and Ceylon there is a nut called " Singhara- 
nut," which is closely allied to the water chestnut, and is 
probably a variety of the same species. Occasionally some 
have been imported and sold, but more for curiosities than 
for eating.

The seeds arc of a dark-brown color, and of the form and 
size shown in the cut, resembling in miniature the skull of 
an ox, with abbreviated horns. When fresh, the kernels 
have an agreeable, nutty flavor.

FOODS. 



T^OOD is that which taken into the body forms blood, 
1 muscles, and brain. 

It naturally follows that in order to have good blood and 
strong muscles, one must partake of good, nutritious food. 
That which is not converted into blood is not food, and 
should be left out of the bill of fare. 

Pepper and spices, whisky, tobacco, and coffee are not 
foods, they can not be made into blood, and therefore 
should never enter the stomach. 

With respect to their use in the body, foods are classified 
into carbonaceous and nitrogenous elements. The carbona- 
ceous elements are those which furnish heat and force, while 
the nitrogenous elements produce muscle and brain. 

The carbonaceous foods are the starches, sugars, and 
fats. The system requires six or seven times as much of the 
carbonaceous as of the nitrogenous element. If more is 
taken than the system can use at the time, the surplus is 
stored away in the body in the form of fat. 

The nitrogenous foods are first, albumen, of which the 
white of an egg is the best example,-- secondly, the casein 
found in milk and legumes, and thirdly, the gluten found in 
grains. Only about three ounces of nitrogenous material can 
be used by the system in one day, and if more is eaten, it 
can not, like the carbonaceous, be laid up in the system for 
future use, but must be disposed of in the same manner as 
poison, which puts extra work upon the internal organs. 

[59] 



60 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

It is therefore necessary that the housewife and mother 
should be careful that the meal contains both elements in as 
nearly the right proportion as possible. Too much food of 
either element is harmful. People are more likely to overeat 
than to eat too little. I have no doubt but that the majority 
of people would be healthier, fleshier, and have a clearer 
brain if they would take only two thirds of the amount which 
they are in the habit of eating. Rapid eating is one of the 
chief causes of overeating. This evil habit is so customary 
among Ameiicans that it has become a proverb. The food 
is not masticated thoroughly, and of course can not be mixed 
with the saliva, and the starch, instead of being digested by 
the saliva, is left to ferment in the stomach. The use of 
condiments is another cause for overeating. The highly 
spiced foods so please the palate and at the same time 
dt aden the nerves of the stomach, that they can not cry 
"Enough!' Plain and simple foods, prepared without 
spices or grease will seldom cause one to overeat. It is' 1 not 
the amount of food we eat that gives us strength and flesh, 
but the amount we digest, and a moderate meal is much 
easier for the stomach to digest than an immoderate one. 



COMBINATIONS OF FOODS. 



A PERFECT DIET. 

A PERFECT diet is one which gives the most strength 
with the least taxation on the vital forces, and the least 
encouragement to intemperance. 

In the beginning God gave to man a perfect diet - - fruits 
(including nuts), grains, and vegetables. Gen. I : 29. And 
the Lord intends to bring his people back to live upon this 
original diet. 

' ' We advise you to change your habit of living ; but 
while you do this, we caution you to move understandingly. 
I am acquainted with families who have changed from a meat 
diet to one that is impoverished. Their food is so poorly pre- 
pared that the stomach loathes it. Here is one reason why 
some have not been successful in their efforts to simplify 
their food." -" Hca Itlifnl Living," par. ,77. 

In making a change from a meat to a vegetarian diet, 
great care should be taken to supply the table with well- 
cooked articles of food, that the appetite, when not per- 
verted, may relish it. "There should not be many kinds of 
food at any one meal, but all meals should not be composed 
of the same kinds of food without variation." -Ibid., 
par. 367. 

The best combinations of foods are the following : Fruits 
and grains ; grains, vegetables, and nuts. 

It is best to have fruits and grains for breakfast, and 
grains, vegetables, and nuts for dinner. Grains would include 
not only all kinds of mushes and gruels made from grains, but 

[6, j 



62 GUIDE FOR NUT COoKKKY. 

all kinds of breads, -rolls, sticks, gems, crackers, raised bread 
and buns, zwieback, granola, and granose. Fruits can be 
served in a variety of ways, fresh, stewed, on toasts, fruit 
juice, and fruit sauces. Nuts may also .be used with the 
breakfast if desired, as nuts combine- very well with fruits. 
Then for dinner, the grains prepared in any of the various 
ways, with vegetables and nuts, which can be prepared in a 
hundred different ways, are variety enough. 

The supper, if any is taken, should be very light, a raw 
apple or some other fruit, or a little hot gruel or rice, some- 
thing that will digest quickly. 

The general rules for food combinations are the fol- 
lowing : - 

I. Do not combine fruits with nitrogenous foods. 

II. Never combine foods where the time of digestion 
greatly differs, for example : apples digest in two hours, 
boiled beets in three hours and forty-five minutes, and 
potatoes in three hours and thirty minutes. If these 
were eaten at the same meal, the apple would have to 
remain in the stomach for one hour and forty-five minutes 
after it was digested before it could leave the stomach, with 
the other food ; and during that time, if the stomach was 
weak, fermentation might set in. If the stomach is healthy, 
the gastric juice will be strong enough to destroy all fermen- 
tation germs. For this reason, nothing seems to hurt a 
healthy stomach, but continued ill treatment will cause it 
to weaken. 

BAD COMBINATIONS. 

Milk and sugar, fruits and vegetables, and fruits and 
nitrogenous foods. "Some use milk and a large amount 
of sugar on mush, thinking they are carrying out health 
reform ; but the sugar and milk combined are liable to cause 



COMBINATIONS OF FOODS. 63 

fermentation in the stomach, and are thus harmful. The free 
use of sugar in any form tends to clog the system and is not 
unfrequently a cause of disease." -"Healthful Living" 
par. 3 J 9 . 

" Mixed and complicated dishes are injurious to the health 
of human beings. If we would preserve the best health, we 
should avoid eating vegetables and fruit at the same meal." 
-"Healthful Living," par. ij6.

NUTS: THEIR PROPERTIES AND 
FOOD VALUES. 



NUT foods are practically a new thing among the civilized 
people of the world. Only a few years have elapsed 
since they have been used at all ; but so well are they being 
received by all classes of people, that the time promises to be 
near at hand when those who desire to live healthfully, and 
avoid the diseases caused by meat-eating, can do so by sub- 
stituting in its place pure, nutritious, and healthful nuts. 

That nuts can fully take the place of meat can be proved 
by analysis, which shows that they actually contain more of 
the nutritious elements of beefsteak than beefsteak itself. 
The following is a comparison between the two : 

Albuminous Carbona Total 

Elements. ceous. Nutriment.

"When we feed on flesh, the juices of what we eat pass 
into the circulation, a feverish condition is created, because 
the animals are diseased, and by partaking of their flesh, we 
plant the seeds of disease in our own tissue and blood. Then 
when exposed to the changes in a malarious atmosphere, to 
prevailing epidemics, and contagious diseases, these are more 
sensibly felt, for the system is not in a condition to resist 
disease. The practise of eating largely of meat is causing 
diseases of all kinds, cancers, tumors, scrofula, tuberculosis, 
and other like affections." - "Healthful Living." 
[64] 



NUTS I THEIR PROPERTIES AND FOOD VALUES. 65 

Eminent physicians are being aroused by the increase of 
disease in the land, and health boards have been established 
which are doing all they can in the line of educating and 
enlightening the people upon these subjects, and warning 
them to be careful in contagious diseases that they destroy 
all germs by thorough disinfection. They are also more than 
ever cautioning the people about their water and milk supply. 
So much has been said about the diseases of animals in the 
last few years that a great many people would be glad to give 
up eating the flesh and using the products of animals if they 
could get something to fill their place. Some who have con- 
scientiously entered into a reform on diet, rejecting flesh, 
animal fats, and butter, have sat down to a table so impover- 
ished that the food upon it is scarcely sufficient in nutrition to 
hold the body and soul together ; so they finally lose their 
conscientiousness in the matter and go back to meat-eating, 
because the old adage is true which says, "The conscience 
is never strengthened by an empty stomach." "Something 
must be prepared to take the place of meat, and these foods 
must be well-prepared so that meat will not be desired." 
"Healthful Living," par. j.j.o. 

And this is just what nut foods will do, not only as far as 
nutrition is concerned, but they will also render food more 
palatable, much like the taste of meats, without having their 
injurious effects. 

A meal composed of potatoes, beans, and rolled oats, with 
no other seasoning than a little salt, although it be thoroughly 
cooked and perfectly hygienic, and having all the elements 
that the body needs, would not be a palatable meal for one 
who has been in the habit of living upon a highly seasoned 
meat diet, and accustomed to having vegetables served drip- 
ping with grease, and full of pepper and salt ; and there are 
very few who have the moral backbone to live upon a plain 
5 



66 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

diet. But if they will persevere, the appetite, which has 
been perverted, will become so changed that they will relish 
the very foods which they once loathed. This would cer- 
tainly be the case if the healthful diet was persisted in long 
enough. But the majority must be educated away from meat, 
by preparing dishes that so closely resemble the taste of meat 
dishes that the meat will not be missed. By using nuts for 
seasonings, we have the fats, and to some extent the flavor, of 
meat, and there is no harm in using a little of the more sim- 
ple seasoning, as a little salt, sage, celery, parsley, onion, 
vanilla, and rose-water. 

A roast made of walnut or butternut meal, bread-crumbs, 
water, a little salt, sage, and onion juice, with perhaps the 
addition of some beans, peas, or lentils, would be far superior 
to roast beef ; and a mince pie made of pecan meal, apples, 
citron, raisins, and a little sugar, would fully take the place 
of, and be far more healthful than, a pie made of stale meats, 
black with spices, and seasoned with wine or brandy. A 
cake raised with air, shortened with nuts, and flavored with 
vanilla, would be better than one raised with baking-powder 
or soda, and oily with animal fats. 

Thus one might go through the whole catalogue of foods, 
and make a substitute for nearly every hurtful dish, that 
would be healthful and at the same time palatable, by the 
use of nuts in some form. 

It is not necessary to be confined to one kind of nut ; all 
of them are useful in some form. The pinon, or pine-nut, is 
excellent for seasoning foods, and would probably be much 
cheaper than peanuts in Arizona, New Mexico, southern 
California, and other countries where the pine-nut grows. In 
countries where the pecan and hickory-nut are plentiful, these 
can be used. They do not make quite so nice a butter to 
spread on the bread as the peanut or almond, but they are 



NUTS : THEIR PROPERTIES AND FOOD VALUES. 67 

equally as good in seasoning and shortening, and in cake 
making are far superior. 

Nuts are usually described as a fruit, consisting of a 
kernel, or seed, enclosed in a hard, woody, or leathery shell 
that does not open when ripe. They are usually the fruit of 
shrubs or trees, but the tubers of some plants are also called 
nuts, on account of their resemblance to the nuts in taste, 
and their richness in fats. 

Of all the foods which nature gives to man, the nut con- 
tains the most fats, and that in a form which is much easier 
of digestion than animal fats, such as lard, tallow, and butter. 
The reason for this is that the fats of animals are free fats, 
and will not mix with water, while the fats of nuts freely mix 
with water and form an emulsion very much resembling 
'cream. 

Fats are very essential in the system to give the body its 
beautiful form by rilling up unsightly cavities and forming 
cushions. 

Nuts also contain other nutritious elements, such as albu- 
men, sugar, and salts. In fact they are one of the most 
nutritious foods, and the one that most fully takes the place 
of meat in the system. When the legumes and grains are 
used quite extensively, there is no lack in the system ; but if 
the diet is white bread, vegetables, and fruits, there is a lack 
of the nitrogenous elements ; and nuts, instead of meat, 
should be used to make up this deficiency. That the Creator 
never intended man to eat meat is clear from the fact that it 
was not mentioned in the original bill of fare (Gen. I : 29); and 
not until after the flood was he permitted to partake of flesh, 
and then, that only of certain kinds of animals. Fats and 
blood were strictly forbidden. ' ' But the flesh with the life 
thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." Gen. 
9 : 40. ."It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor 
blood." Lev. 3: 17. "And the Lord spake unto Moses, 
saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat 
no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat." Lev. 

7 i-y 1-1 
/ - - > - j- 

The Lord did not lay down these rules for ancient Israel 
and all succeeding generations to be arbitrary or to show his 
authority, but for the reasons given in Deut. 12 : 25 : "Thou 
shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee, and with thy 
children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in 
the sight of the Lord." 

The fat of animals is more likely to be diseased than 
other portions of the body ; for it is not used in exercise as 
are the muscles. But the blood, which passes through the 
body, washing out all its poison, is undoubtedly itself the 
most poisonous part, and to use these poisonous substances 
as articles of food could work nothing but disease. The 
Lord, who saw all things from the beginning, foresaw the 
result of using such articles of food, and would save man 
from the consequences. 

It was only on account of the hardness of men's hearts 
that God permitted them to eat flesh ; but in the beginning 
it was not so. God designed that man should live only upon 
the pure, healthful things of earth, that which would best 
sustain and build up the brain and body of man. 

The purest and most easily digested of all meats is the 
meat of nuts. In nutritive value, they far exceed all flesh- 
meats. Beefsteak, for example, has 19 per cent, of nitroge- 
nous material and 4 per cent, of carbonaceous, total, 28 
per cent. ; while the peanut has 28 per cent, of nitrogenous 
and 46 per cent, of carbonaceous, total 79 per cent, nutri- 
tive. That is, one pound of peanuts is equal in nutritive 
value to more than two and one-half pounds of beefsteak. 



NUTS : THEIR PROPERTIES AND FOOD VALUES. 69 

Nuts contain but little starch, excepting the chestnut, 
which has 70 per cent., and the walnut, which has 14 per 
cent, of starch ; but the other kinds of nuts have very little. 
For this reason, they are adapted to people that are suffering 
from hyperpepsia, who are usually unable to digest starch. 
For such persons a diet of nuts with, digested starch, as is 
found in malt extract, is very beneficial. Malt can be com- 
bined with any of the nuts, either after they are made into 
butter or in the meal. 

Nuts are more digestible if they are first emulsified, as 
very few can masticate them fine enough to be acted upon by 
the digestive juices. The question of emulsifying nuts has 
been practically settled in the last few years by the invention 
of machinery for that purpose, both for family and factory 
use. It is sincerely hoped and believed that the time is not 
far distant when nuts will fully take the place of animal flesh, 
fats, and products. 



NUT BUTTER. 



THE production of nut butter is a very simple process. 
The peanut and almond are the nuts that are chiefly 
used for this purpose ; but the Brazil-nuts make a very fine 
butter. All of the nuts can be ground, but as they can not be 
blanched, they do not make a nice looking butter. The 
Spanish peanut has proved the most satisfactory for butter 
making, although some people prefer the Virginia variety. 
The first essential thing is to have a nut-grinding mill. 

PEANUT BUTTER. 

The first step is to roast the peanuts to a nice brown, 
being careful not to over-brown or scorch them, as too much 
cooking spoils the flavor. They can be roasted in an 
ordinary oven, but can be better done in a peanut roaster 
made especially for this purpose. As soon as they are 
roasted and cool, the skins or bran should be removed by 
rubbing them in the hands, or what is better, a coarse bag ; 
or take a square piece of cloth and fold the edges together, 
forming a bag of it. The chaff can then be removed by the 
use of an ordinary fan, or by pouring from one dish to an- 
other where the wind is blowing. The process of removing 
the skins is called blanching. Next look them over carefully, 
remove all defective nuts and foreign substances, and they 
are ready for grinding. If a fine, oily butter is desired, 
adjust the mill quite closely, and place in the oven to warm. 
Feed the mill slowly, turn rapidly, and always use freshly 
roasted nuts ; after they have stood a day or two they will 
( 70} 



NUT BUTTER. /I 

not grind well nor make oily butter. If the butter is kept in 
a cool place in a covered dish, and no moisture allowed to 
come in contact with it, it will keep several weeks ; and if put 
in sealed jars or cans, will keep indefinitely. 

RAW PEANUT BUTTER. 

Heat the peanuts just sufficiently to remove the skins, 
but do not allow them to get brown ; prepare them as de- 
scribed in a former recipe, and grind in a nut mill. Although 
the raw peanut butter is not as palatable as the roasted but- 
ter, it is considered more healthful and easier of digestion. 
It is also preferable to use in making soups and puddings, in 
cooking grains, and in seasoning vegetables. Food seasoned 
with this butter does not have that objectionable taste that 
the roasted peanut butter imparts ; and if it is properly used, 
the peanut taste is almost entirely eliminated. 

ALMOND BUTTER. 

Almond butter is more difficult to make than peanut but- 
ter because the skins can not be so easily removed. Roasting 
does not loosen the skins of the almond as it does of the 
peanut. They have to be soaked in boiling water from two 
to five minutes ; then the skins become loose and can be 
pinched off by pressing on the nut with the thumb and fin- 
ger ; the skin will crack and the kernel pop out. But by 
this process the nuts have soaked up some water and become 
tough. They must then be dried in the oven until quite crisp, 
but the oven must not be hot, or they will brown. Then run 
them through a loosely adjusted mill or a sausage grinder, 
and place on a cloth stretched over the stove until perfectly 
dry ; then grind them in the nut-butter mill, quite tightly 
adjusted. This makes excellent butter if the almonds are 
first-class, and sweet. 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



/ " 



BRAZIL-NUT BUTTER. 

It is cheapest and best to buy the nuts already shelled, 
then with a sharp knife cut off all the brown, woody skin that 
adheres to them, and grind them through the mill. They 
may have to be broken up before putting in the mill. This 
butter is very good, but not so cheap as peanut butter, except- 
ing in the countries where this nut grows. 

PEANUT CREAM. 

For making cream, the peanuts should not be roasted so 
much as for making butter. They should have a light straw 
color. Then grind them very fine, and to a tablespoonful of 
nut butter add I \ cups of water, adding a little at a time, 
and beating until it is smooth. 

PEANUT MILK. 

Make like the peanut cream, only add more water. The 
amount of nut butter to be used depends upon the richness of 
the rnilk desired. 

RAW PEANUT MILK AND CREAM. 

Put the peanuts in the oven or peanut roaster, and let 
them stay until they are hot, but not the least browned ; the 
skins will then be loose enough to blanch quite easily. Pick 
out those that will not blanch without extra effort, and save 
them to roast. They can be put with raw nuts, as it will 
take just as long to roast them after they have been once 
cooled, as it will to roast those that have not been heated. 
Look the raw nuts over carefully, as every speck or dark spot 
will show in the unroasted nuts. Grind them to a meal ; i-f 
they are ground until buttery and oily, it is hard to get 
the milk out. Then to 2 cups of the meal add 3 cups of 



NUT BUTTER. 73 

lukewarm or cold water ; beat well with a spoon for four or 
five minutes, then line an earthen pan or bowl with two 
thicknesses of cheese-cloth, and pour in the mixture ; fold the 
edges of the cloth together, and squeeze out the milk. It 
will look like dairy milk. The last will look quite thick, and 
some of the finest part of the pulp wall go through, but that 
will do no harm as it will settle to the bottom when left to 
stand. The cream will also rise to the top. If the nuts are 
properly ground, the cream should be from one half to three 
fourths of an inch thick on a dish where the milk was three 
inches deep. It is richer than dairy cream, and can be used 
for all purposes for which dairy cream is used in seasonings 
and shortenings. 

This cream diluted with water to the consistency of milk, 
and a very little salt and sugar added, makes a milk which 
tastes like, and closely resembles, dairy milk. The residue 
can be made into nut meal by steaming and then drying, or 
made into nutmeatose, sausages, etc. Raw peanuts are 
considered beneficial in some forms of dyspepsia. The milk, 
if cooked in a double boiler for two or three hours, has none 
of the raw taste left ; but the cream, if cooked for any length 
of time, becomes oily. The raw taste is not noticeable 
when used in cake, crisps, rolls, or pie crust. The house- 
wife will find this recipe invaluable. 

ALMOND MILK. 

Dissolve i tablespoonful of almond butter in I pint of 
warm water, adding a little at a time. 

HICKORY MILK. 

Crack the hickory-nuts and pick out the kernels ; grind 
them through the mill, being careful not to grind them too 
fine or they will be oily. Then to each heaping cupful 



74 ( 11' IDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

of the nut meal add i \ cups of lukewarm water and 
beat thoroughly, rubbing the mixture against the side of the 
dish with the back of the spoon. Then line a large bowl 
with two thicknesses of clean, strong cheese-cloth, pour in 
the nuts, and squeeze out the milk. After the milk is taken 
out, the remainder can be made into sausages or gravy. 

PINE-NUT MILK. 

Grind the pine-nuts through the mill, and then add about 
i.^ cups of water to i cup of the butter or meal; beat 
well and press all the milk through a cloth. The remain- 
der- -that is, the part that is left in the cloth --can be 
used in making sausages, soups, or in roasts. The milk can 
be used in vegetables or in making gravies, while the cream 
that rises on top is excellent for making crisps, rolls, cakes, 
and pie crust. 

CHUFAS MILK. 

Select good, fresh chufas, wash them well in several waters, 
and grind quite fine; then pour over them hot water enough 
to wet well, but not to make them too watery; rub well, 
pressing them against the dish, with the spoon, and pour into 
a jelly-bag made of two thicknesses of cheese-cloth. Then 
press with the hands to squeeze out the milk. 

COCOANUT MILK. 

Select a cocoanut that has milk in it, cut a hole in the 
eye of the nut, and let out the milk. Then break the nut 
with a hammer, remove the meat, and with a sharp knife 
peel off the hard, brown, woody coat, being careful to take 
as thin a peeling as possible, as the most of the oil is next to 
the skin. Then grate through a cocoanut-shredder, or on 
any grater, or grind through the mill, then for each cocoanut. 



NUT BUTTER. 75 

add 2 cups of boiling water, and with a tablespoon beat 
and work for ten or fifteen minutes. Place a clean new 
cheese-cloth over a large bowl, and pour the cocoanut into it. 
\York well with the hands, and squeeze out all the milk 
possible, then empty the cloth into a stew-pan, pour boiling 
water over it the same as before, work well again, and squeeze 
through the cloth the second time. You will then have all 
the milk that can be taken out, but the cocoanut can be 
cooked in water for twenty or thirty minutes and then 
strained, and the water used for making pie, the same as in 
cocoanut-pie recipe. 



NUT MEAL 



PEANUT MEAL. 

HEAT the nuts sufficiently to remove the skins ; but do 
not brown them. Blanch and look over. Boil until 
real tender, taking 1 care to have them quite dry when done. 
Drain off all the water possible, and put them through a 
vegetable press, or colander. Put on tins suspended over 
the stove, or in a very slow oven with the door open. Do 
not brown the nuts-- only dry them. When perfectly dry, 
i^rind through the mill loosely adjusted. If it is not fine 
enough, let it dry out some more, tighten the mill a little, 
and grind again ; and if it is desired very fine, rub through 
a flour sieve. 

PEANUT MEAL NO. 2. 

A very rich meal can be made by grinding the raw peanuts 
after the hulls have been removed, being careful not to get it 
too fine, or it will be oily. Then steam the raw meal in a 
steam-cooker for three or four hours. Remove from the 
steamer, and spread on tins to dry. When perfectly dry, 
grind through the mill. It will not be so light a meal as that 
made from boiled peanuts, but seems to be richer in fats. If 
this meal is ground through a tightly adjusted mill, it makes 
an excellent butter, and can be eaten by those who can not 
assimilate the roasted peanut butter. 
[76] 



NUT MEAL. 77 

ALMOND MEAL. 

Blanch the almonds the same as directed for making alm- 
ond butter. Then dry them in the oven or where it is real 
warm, taking care not to scorch. When very dry, chop fine 
by putting through a meat-chopper or mill ; return to the 
oven, and dry very slowly and thoroughly. When cold, 
grind through the meat-chopper again or through a loosely 
adjusted nut-butter mill. 

PINE-NUT MEAL. 

This is the easiest of all meals to make, as the nuts need 
no hulling or drying before grinding. All that is necessary is 
to grind them through the nut-butter mill, being careful not 
to grind fine enough to make them oily ; or they may be 
crushed with a bottle on a plate or platter. They are very 
tender, and can be easily crushed between the fingers. 

WALNUT MEAL. 

The walnut is rather oily, and if ground through the nut- 
butter mill is likely to become oily, unless the mill is quite 
loosely adjusted. They make better meal if run through a 
meat-chopper. For ordinary purposes they can be chopped 
with the skins on ; but if desired, the skins may be removed 
by placing the walnut kernels in the oven for a few minutes 
until they become hot. When cold, the skins may be easily 
rubbed off, and then chopped or ground. 

FILBERT MEAL. 

The filbert kernel is quite hard, and can be reduced to a 
meal only by grinding through a nut-butter mill, or a meat- 
chopper that cuts very fine. The skins may be removed by 
heating the kernels in the oven until they are very hot but 



78 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

not roasted. Remove from the oven, and when cool, rub 
between the hands or on a blanching sieve, and the skins will 
come off. Grind through the nut-butter mill. 

/ 

BUTTERNUT MEAL. 

Crack the nuts on the end, and remove as whole as pos- 
sible. Place in a hot oven for a few minutes until they 
become hot, then cool them, and the skins will rub off easily. 
Chop through a meat-chopper or crush fine with a glass 
rolling-pin on a marble slab. If a marble slab and glass 
rolling-pin are not at hand, use a large plate or platter and a 
round bottle. They may be used without removing the skins, 
and are just as well for cake, as the skins give it a spicy flavor. 

HICKORY, PECAN, AND OTHER NUTS 

Can be made into meal the same as walnuts. They are 
usually used with the skins on, as they are quite difficult to 
remove. 



SAUSAGES. 



HICKORY-NUT SAUSAGE. 

TO i cup of hickory-nut meal, add i egg, a pinch each of 
salt and sage, and 2 teaspoonfuls of gluten. Mix well, 
adding the well-beaten egg the last, form into round cakes 
with the hands, and bake until brown. Serve hot on a plat- 
ter, with a hickory-nut gravy poured over. This can be made 
from what is left after the milk has been extracted, but less 
gluten will be required. 

PEANUT SAUSAGES. 

Take i tablespoonful peanut butter, 3 tablespoonfuls glu- 
ten or dry bread-crumbs, a little salt, sage, and parsley. The 
parsley should be minced very fine. Dissolve the nut butter 
in 2 tablespoonfuls of water, add the gluten, sage, salt, and 
parsley, mix well together, and form into small cakes with 
the hands. Place on an oiled tin, and bake in the oven, or 
cook on top of the stove ; cook on both sides. When done, 
place in a platter and pour over them Peanut Gravy No. i. 
(See Index.) 

PINE-NUT SAUSAGES. 

Take 4 tablespoonfuls of finely ground zwieola, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of pine-nut meal, } 3 cup water, a little sage, celery, 
and salt. Pour the water on the zwieola, and let it soak for 
ten or fifteen minutes ; then add the other ingredients and 
mix well ; if too dry, add more water, but be careful and 
have it as dry as can be handled well ; form with the hands 

[79] 



8O GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

into small cakes, and bake on oiled tins. When done, place 
in a platter, and pour over them the following gravy : 

Take I cup boiling water, I tablespoonful pine-nut meal, 
and I tablespoonful white flour rubbed smooth in a little cold 
water. 

Stir the flour into the hot water, add the meal and salt, 
and a little grated onion, let it boil for a few minutes, and 
pour over the sausage. 

FILBERT SAUSAGE. 

Take 4 tablespoonfuls zwieola and soak in | cup of cold 
water for a few minutes, then add 2 tablespoonfuls of filbert 
meal, a pinch of sifted sage, I teaspoonful of grated onion, 
salt to taste ; mix well, and if too dry, add a little more 
water, but as little as possible and have it stick together. 
Make into small cakes with the hands, place on an oiled tin, 
and bake in the oven or cook on top of the stove, and turn 
over when brown on one side. When done, place on a 
platter, and pour over them a gravy made of filbert meal as 
follows : - 

Take I cup water, I heaping tablespoonful filbert meal, 
and I tablespoonful white flour, a little grated onion, and a 
little salt. 

Heat the water to boiling ; dissolve the meal in a little 
warm water, put in the flour and salt, and rub it smooth, 
then stir all into the boiling water, and cook for a few 
minutes. 

PECAN SAUSAGE. 

Take 3 tablespoonfuls of finely ground zwieola and soak in 
^ cup water until quite soft, but not mushy ; then add 2 
small tablespoonfuls of pecan meal, a pinch of sage, and a 
little grated onion ; salt to taste. Mix all together and form 



SAUSAGES. 8 1 



into round pancakes about one-half inch thick. The mixture 
should be as thick as can be handled conveniently. Put 
them on oiled tins, and bake in the oven or on top of the 
stove until nicely browned on both sides. Place in a platter 
and pour over them a gravy made of pecans. (See Pecan 
Gravy. ) 



NUT OIL 



NUT OIL NO. I. 

T)REPARE cocoanut the same as for making cocoanut 
1 cream ; then grind it through a nut-butter mill until it 
is quite fine. To i cup of this add 5 or 6 cups of water, and 
boil in a kettle for an hour ; then set in a cool place, and the 
oil will rise to the top, and will become hard like tallow if 
the temperature is not higher than fifty degrees above zero. 
The sediment will settle to the bottom, leaving the oil white 
and clear, retaining a delicate cocoanut flavor. 

NUT OIL NO. 2. 

Take 2 cups of medium-brown peanut butter ; add to it I 
scant cup of malt extract ; mix well, and knead like bread 
until it is very oily ; then grind it through the nut-butter mill, 
and squeeze out what oil you can with the hands, and grind 
it through the mill the second time. Squeeze again thor- 
oughly. This ought easily to make one cup of oil. 

The remainder can be used in making malt food. (See 
directions for making malt food.) 

Oil can be extracted from butter made from other nuts by 
the foregoing method. 

If there is any sediment or particles of the nuts in the 
oil, let it stand, and they will settle, when the top can be 
poured off, and will be clear, nice oil. 
[82] 



NUT OIL. 83 

NUT OIL NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of peanut butter, or the butter made from 
any nuts ; add to it I cup of scrghum (or an}- thick) molassej ; 
mix and knead until it is very oily, and finish the same as 
Nut Oil No. 2. 

NUT OIL NO. i. 

When making fruitosia, the sweetness of the fruit will start 
the oil, and after it is ground through the mill, some of the 
oil may be pressed out, and the food will then be rich enough. 
In an ordinary family this will furnish oil enough for oiling 
pans, etc. 



NUTMEATOSE, NUTORA, ETC. 



IX order to have these foods a perfect success, care must be 
taken to have them well cooked. They are better if cooked 
in sealed cans, and under a high pressure of steam, as they 
will then be quite solid, and can be stewed without crumbling. 
The higher temperature used, and the longer they are cooked, 
the more solid the foods will be, and less starch and other 
ingredients will be required with the nuts. When it can be 
afforded, we advise getting a good steam-cooker, as better 
results can be obtained. The Ideal steam-cooker can not be 
too highly recommended. But they are very good if cooked 
in a common baking-powder can ; or any can or pail will do 
which has straight sides and a tight cover, with an opening the 
full size of the can, so when the food is cold it can be easily 
taken out of the can. These foods may be cooked in a bag 
made of thick, firm white muslin, which should be well 
scalded before using, and when filled, tied with a stout twine. 

An economical way of obtaining sealed cans is to unsolder 
all the fruit and vegetable cans which you may purchase of 
your grocer, - unsoldering the little cap which covers the 
opening. This can be done with any hot iron. After the 
cans are cleansed, and filled with the nut mixture, the little 
cap can be soldered on again. Cans can not be used but 
once this way ; but the contents will keep well if thoroughly 
cooked. 

If an ordinary steamer is used, more time will be required 
for cooking, as it is not possible to get the ordinary steamer 
[84] 



NUTMEATOSE, NUTORA, ETC. 8$ 

so tight but that some of the steam will escape. If these 
foods are to be kept for any length of time, they must be put 
into sealed cans, and cooked for about five hours. 

They can be cooked in a double boiler, also in a covered 
kettle of water ; if the can or pail is not sealed, too much 
water should not be used. The cover of the dish should be 
tied on or weighted, and the water should not be deep enough 
to cover the dish. 

For those who desire a change, there is a wide field open 
before them ; by using different kinds of nuts, and combining 
them with all the different kinds of grains, vegetables, and 
seasonings, hundreds of various foods can be made. A little 
effort and experience is all that is necessary. 

NUTORA OF PEANUTS. 

Take 2 cups of raw nut butter or nut meal, add i cup 
of water, and salt to taste ; beat with an egg beater for five 
minutes or more, then put into cans, and cook three or four 
hours. If i cup more of water and I cup of corn-starch are 
added, it will not be so rich and oily. 

PEANUTS AND STARCH NUTORA. 

Take 2 cups of raw nut butter, i cup of water, salt to 
taste ; add 4 heaping tablespoonfuls of corn-starch. Dis- 
solve the starch in the water, and add the other ingredients ; 
mix thoroughly, and beat well with a spoon for several min- 
utes, then place in cans, and cook in a steam-cooker or 
steamer for three or four hours. 

The corn-starch makes it more solid. 



86 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



NUTORA WITH PEANUTS AND EGGS. 

Take 2 cups of raw peanut butter, i cup of water, the 
white of i egg, and salt to taste. Add the water to the 
butter, a little at a time, until it is smooth. It should be 
thin enough to beat with an egg beater ; if it is not, add 
more water, and beat for five minutes. Then take the white 
of i egg, and beat to a stiff froth ; add it to the nut but- 
ter, and beat again for a few minutes ; put it in cans, and 
cook for three hours. 



PEANUT AND ALMOND NUTORA. 

Take i cup of almond butter, made from good, sweet 
almonds, 2 cups of raw peanut butter, salt to taste, and i^ 
cups of water, or enough so it can be beaten, but it must be 
as stiff as possible. When thoroughly mixed, beat with an 
egg beater for five minutes or longer, and cook in cans for 
three hours or longer. This makes it very rich ; if it is not 
desired so rich, add i^ cups more of water and i } 2 cups of 
corn-starch. 

PEANUT AND PINE-NUT NUTORA. 

Take 2 cups of raw peanut butter, i cup of pine-nut but- 
ter, 3 cups of water, and salt to taste. Dissolve the butter 
with the water, adding a little at a time; then add salt to 
suit the taste, and beat with an egg beater for a few min- 
utes; place in cans, and cook in the steamer for three or 
four hours. If the cans are sealed, they can be cooked in a 
kettle of water. If you desire it to be thick and firm like 
cheese, a little corn-starch or flour can be added --about 6 
tablespoonfuls. 



NUTMEATOSE, NUTORA, ETC. 87 

PINE-NUT NUTORA NO. J. 

Take i cup of ground pine-nuts, i cup of beans or peas, i 
cup of water, salt to taste. Add the water, nut meal, and salt, 
and beat with an egg beater for five minutes or longer. Then 
add the peas or beans, mix thoroughly, put into cans, and cook 
for two hours or longer. 

PINE-NUT NUTORA NO. 2. 

Take i cup of roasted pine-nut butter, i cup of raw pea- 
nut butter, 2 cups of water, i cup of corn-starch, or white 
Hour. Dissolve the starch in a little of the water, pour it on 
the butter, and as soon as it is worked in, add the rest of the 
water, a little at a time, until all is smooth; add the salt, 
beat for a few minutes, and put into cans; this can be cooked 
in common baking-powder cans, but it will keep only a few 
days. If cooked in sealed cans for five hours, it will keep for 
any length of time before it is opened; after opening, it will 
spoil in a few days, unless kept very cold. This is a very 
good substitute for meat; the roasted pine-nuts give it a meaty 
flavor. 

PINE-NUT NUTORA NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of roasted pine-nut butter, 2 cups of water, 
i cup of corn-starch or white flour, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 
Add the corn-starch and salt to the butter, and dissolve in a 
little water, adding a little at a time; beat for five minutes, 
and cook in cans, or it may be cooked in a bag made of good, 
thick muslin. If the nutora is for making hash, or cooking, 
it is best to be made real solid, then do not give much room 
for swelling. Tie the bag tight, and steam, or it may be 
boiled if desired. It will not need to cook more than an 
hour. When done, rip the bag open, roll the contents, 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

which should be solid, on a tin, brush with nut cream, and 
set in the oven to brown; serve hot or cold. This tastes 
almost like meat. 

ALMOND NUTORA NO. J. 

Take some good sweet almonds, --if any bitter almonds 
are used, it spoils the flavor,-- blanch them, and put them 
in the oven to roast to a nice straw color. When perfectly 
cold, grind through a nut-butter mill. Take I cup of this 
roasted almond butter, 2 cups of water, I cup of raw peanut 
butter, i cup of corn-starch or white flour, and 2 teaspoonfuls 
of salt. Dissolve the butter and starch in the water, and 
add the other ingredients; then beat for five minutes, pour 
into cans, and steam for four hours. This has a nice meaty 
flavor. 

ALMOND NUTORA NO. 2. 

Take 2 cups of almond butter made from the roasted 
almonds, 2 cups of water, 2\ teaspoonfuls of salt, I cup of 
corn-starch. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly, and cook in 
cans or in a bag for two hours. The roasting of the nuts 
gives it a more meaty flavor, and is very good. 

ONION NUTORA. 

Take 2 cups of raw peanut butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of grated 
onions, 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and i cup of 
corn-starch. Dissolve the butter and starch with the water, 
add the other ingredients, and beat thoroughly. Pour into 
tin cans, and cook for three hours. 

TOMATO NUTORA. 

Take 2 cups of raw peanut butter, i cup of corn-starch or 
flour, 2 cups of tomato juice, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. Dis- 
solve the butter and starch in the tomato juice, add the salt, 



NUTMEATOSE, NUTORA, ETC. 89 

and beat for five minutes. Then pour into cans, and steam 
for four or five hours. 

The tomato gives the nutora a nice salmon color, as well 
as an excellent flavor. It is very good to use in making mock 
salmon salad, etc. 

PECAN NUTORA. 

Take I cup of pecan butter, i^ cups of raw peanut but- 
ter, 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, i cup of corn- 
starch or flour. Add the salt to the water, and dissolve the 
starch and butter in the water, adding a little water at a 
time to keep it from getting lumpy. Beat for five minutes, 
and pour into cans. Steam for four or five minutes. 

PRUNE NUTORA. 

Cook the prunes until they are tender and quite dry. 
Rub them through a colander ; to i cup of sifted prunes add 
i cup of raw peanut butter, ii cups of water, i cup of corn- 
starch, a little salt and sugar to suit the taste. Mix the in- 
gredients by first dissolving the butter and starch in the 
water, and adding the rest. Beat for five minutes, and 
steam in cans for three hours. 

BANANA NUTORA. 

Take good, ripe bananas, peel them, and mash with a sil- 
ver fork. Then to 2 cups of the mashed bananas, add i cup 
of raw peanut butter, i cup of water, ^ cup of sugar, ^ cup 
of corn-starch, and a little salt. Mix all together well, and 
beat for five or ten minutes. Pour into cans, and steam for 
three hours. 

This changes its color if exposed to the air for any great 
length of time. Therefore keep it well covered until needed, 



90 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

NUT CHEESE. 

Take i cup of nut butter, 2 cups of water, ^ cup of flour 
(Pillsbury's or Gold Medal). Rub the butter perfectly smooth 
by adding the water slowly, then add the flour, and lastly the 
salt. Pour into tin cans with a tight-fitting cover, and steam 
in a steam-cooker or in a kettle of water with something in 
the bottom of the kettle to set them on. Cook from two to 
three hours. This can be varied by adding sage, celery salt, 
or caraway seed ground fine. 



NUTMEATO. 



NUTMEATO NO. J. 

TAKE 2\ cups jf strong coffee made from cereal coffee, 2 
cups of nut butter, i cup of corn-starch, and I teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Combine the ingredients by mixing the corn- 
starch, butter, and salt first ; then put in the coffee by adding 
a little at a time, and mixing until smooth. Put into a can 
or dish with tight-fitting cover, and cook in a closed steamer 
or kettle for from three to five hours. Sealed cans give better 
results, and may be used if desired. The contents of the 
cans will be firm, and when cool, may be cut into slices and 
served as cheese or meat. Use lentil dressing as a gravy with 
the nutmeato. 

NUTMEATO NO. 2. 

Take i cup of nut butter, i cup of strained stewed toma- 
toes, \ cup of water, i cup of corn-starch or browned flour, 
and salt to suit the taste. Proceed as in No. i. 

NUTMEATO NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of nut butter, i \ cups of water, 3 tablespoon- 
fuls of corn-starch, | teaspoonful of sage, and i teaspoonful 
of salt. Prepare the same as the other recipes. 

NUTMEATO NO. 4. 

Take 2 cups of butter, 2 cups of water, i cup of cooked 
navy or lima beans, rubbed through a colander, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of corn-starch, and i level teaspoonful of salt. Cook as 
directed in the above recipes. 

[91] 



92 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

NUTMEATO NO. 5. 

Take 2 cups of nut butter, 2 cups of water, whites of 4 
eggs, and I teaspoonful of salt. Cook as in the former 
recipes. 

NUTMEATO NO. 6. 

It is a recognized fact that nut butter when once emulsified 
for the table will not "keep over," but is likely to ferment 
unless the temperature is low. However, no waste need 
occur, for it may be so preserved as to be ready for use in the 
preparation of palatable dishes by the following methods : 
Add to it three times as much water as has already been 
used, and stir in enough white flour to make it of the con- 
sistency of rich cream. Put in a baking dish broad enough 
so the cream will not be more than two inches deep, and 
bake until quite firm. It is good to use for sandwiches, 
sliced as cold meat, and in other recipes. 

NUTMEATO ROAST NO I. 

Take I pint of zwieola or toasted bread-crumbs, I pint of 
water, ^ pint of strained tomatoes, and ^ pound of nutmeato, 
made fine by being put through a colander or meat-chopper. 
Flavor with finely sifted sage. Mix all thoroughly together, 
add salt to taste, and bake in shallow pans until brown. 

NUTMEATO ROAST NO. 2. 

Cut i pound of nutmeatose into pieces, and boil until very 
tender ; then drain and mash. To 2 cups of zwieola, add 
the water in which the nutmeatose has been boiled, and 
enough more hot water to make the zwieola of the consistency 
of mush. Season to suit taste with salt and sage. Add this 
to the mashed nutmeatose, mixing well ; put into an oiled 



NUTMEATO. 93 

pudding dish and bake for about an hour. Slice and serve 
either warm or cold. Toasted bread-crumbs may be used 
instead of zwieola. 

MOCK NUTMEATO ROAST. 

Boil 2 cups of lentils for several hours. Run through a 
colander. Grind i cup of roasted peanuts, and add them to 
the lentils. To 2 cups zwieola or toasted bread-crumbs, add 
sufficient hot water to make it of the consistency of mush. 
Season to suit taste with salt and sage. Mix all the ingredi- 
ents, place in an oiled pudding dish, bake, and serve same as 
nutmeato roast. Beans may be substituted for lentils if the 
latter can not be obtained. 

NUTMEATO HASH. 

Chop together 3 parts cold baked potatoes, i part nut- 
meato, and i part tomatoes until thoroughly mixed. Flavor 
with finely sifted sage, if desired, and season with salt. Bake 
till brown. Leave out tomatoes if preferred. 

NUTMEATO STEW. 

Cut nutmeato into small cubes, place in the inner part of 
a double cooker, cover well with water, and cook two or three 
hours. Just before serving, thicken the liquid with browned 
flour, and season with salt. Strained tomatoes may be used 
instead of water, and are preferred by many. Prolonged 
cooking produces the best results. 

NUTMEATO AND POTATO STEW. 

Stew together 2 parts potatoes, coarsely and irregularly 
cut, and i part nutmeato cut into cubes, until potatoes are 
done. It may be flavored with celery or onions, which 



94 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

should be added just long enough before the stew is cooked 
to extract the flavor. Salt just before it is done. Strained 
tomatoes may be used instead of water if preferred. 

NUTMEATO GRAVY. 

In I quart of boiling salted water put nearly i pint of 
cubes cut from nutmeato. In fifteen or twenty minutes 
thicken with browned or plain flour. 

RICE WITH NUTMEATO. 

Cook rice in boiling salted water, having it of the consist- 
ency desired. Cut a portion of nutmeato into cubes, and 
distribute it evenly through the rice. Cook slowly and stew 
without stirring again. 

MACARONI WITH NUTMEATO. 

Break macaroni into inch lengths and drop gradually into 
just enough boiling salted water so that it will be of the right 
consistency to serve. Cut nutmeato into cubes or slices and 
stir them in when the macaroni begins to be tender. Care 
must be taken that the macaroni does not burn or fasten to 
the bottom. 

BAKED NUTMEATO HASH. 

Take 2 cups of chopped cold boiled potatoes, i of chopped 
nutmeato, and i grated onion ; salt to taste. Put in an oiled 
baking dish, and add i tablespoonful of water, and bake one- 
half hour in moderate oven. The above may be flavored 
with celery salt if desired. 

NUTMEATO STEAK. 

Take nutmeato that has been cooked in cans about three 
inches in diameter. Remove from can by cutting around edge 
of the can, and pressing on the bottom, cut off into slices 



NUTMKATO. 95 

one-half inch thick, being careful not to break in pieces. 
Place on tins and toast in the oven. \\'hen toasted, place 
on meat platter, and pour over it a nut gravy made accord- 
ing to recipe No. i. 

NUTGRANO NO. J. 

Take 2 cups of oatmeal, or chopped oats, I cup of raw 
peanut butter, salt to suit the taste, and 3 cups of hot water. 
Mix well, adding a little water at a time, until it is all smooth. 
Beat for a few minutes, and cook in cans the same as nut- 
meatose for four or five hours. 

This can be spread on the bread, and makes a fine substi- 
tute for butter. 

If the water is set on the stove and the grains stirred in 
and allowed to thicken some before the other ingredients are 
added, it will not be so liable to settle to the bottom in 



cooking. 



NUTGRANO NO. 2. 



Take 3 cups of pearl barley, i cup of roasted pine-nut 
butter, 8 cups of water, and 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. Roast 
the pine-nuts by baking them in the oven until they are of a 
light-brown color. When they are cold, grind them to a but- 
ter, using i cupful of it. Add the other ingredients ; mix and 
cook in cans in a steam-cooker for five hours. 

It is best to cook the barley in the water for a few min- 
utes before adding the other ingredients. This will prevent 
it from settling to the bottom. 



NUTGRANO NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of white corn-meal (the yellow will do), i 
cup of roasted almond butter, made by roasting the blanched 
almonds in the oven until they are of a straw color, and when

cold, grinding them to a butter, adding 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 
Mix all thoroughly with 5 cups of water, and cook like the 
foregoing recipe. 

NUTGRANO NO. 4. 

Make like the above, only use 2 cups of wheaten grits in- 
stead of corn-meal, and use only 4.\ cups of hot water. 
Cook the grits in the water for a few minutes before add- 
ing the rest. 

NUTGRANO NO. 5. 

Take 2 cups of crystal wheat, i cup of roasted pine-nut 
butter, 8 cups of water, and salt to taste. Mix, and cook in 
cans for four or Jive hours. First cook the grain with the 
water for a few minutes. 

NUTGRANO NO. 6. 

Take 3 cups of rolled oats, I cup of almond meal. 3? 
cups of water, and i teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, and 
cook like the preceding recipes. 

NUTGRANO NO. 7. 

Take 2 cups of farina, i 1 2 cups of pecan meal, 8 A cups of 
water, and 2 teaspoonfuls of salt. Mix well, and cook like 
preceding recipes. 

NUTGRANO NO. 8. 

Take 2 cups of wheaten grits, i cup of raw peanut but- 
ter, 4 cups of water, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook 
like the above. 

NUTGRANO NO. 9. 

Take 2 cups of zwieola, 2 cups of roasted peanut butter, 
6 cups of water, and salt to taste. Mix all well and cook like 
the other recipes. 



NUTMEATO. 97 

By combining different nuts with different grains man\ 
kinds of nutgrano may be made. 

NUTGRANO NO. JO. 

Take i cup of roasted peanut butter, i^ cups of granose, 
and 1 1 cups of water, salt to taste. Take granose flakes, and 
heat them in the oven, and rub with the hands until quite 
fine. Stir i^ cups of this into the butter, which has been

NUTMEATOSE NO. 4. 

Take I cup of nut butter, I cup of sifted Scotch peas, 
i \ cups of water, two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, and 
i teaspoonful of salt. 

First cook the peas as directed elsewhere, then sift through 
a colander, and use i cup after they are sifted ; add the other 
ingredients, and cook the same as in Nutmeatose No. i . 

NUTMEATOSE NO. 5.

NUTMEATOSE NO, 6. 

Make like recipe No. 4, only use i cup of cooked split 
peas in the place of the Scotch peas, and leave out the 
starch. 

NUTMEATOSE NO. 7. 

Take 2 cups of chestnut meal, made by first removing 
them from the shell, then blanching them by pouring on boil- 
ing water and letting them stand a few minutes in it, and 
then grinding in a meat-chopper, or they may be dried and 
ground in a hand grist-mill or coffee-mill. To this add i cup 
of raw peanut butter, 2 cups of water, and salt to taste. 
Mix well, and cook as in Nutmeatose No. i. 

FRUTOSE. 

Take .^ cup peanut butter, .\ cup of almond butter, and 
i dozen medium-sized bananas. Peel the bananas, and mash 
them through a vegetable press, or mash with a silver fork. 
Then add the nut butter, and beat until well mixed and 
smooth. Pour into cans with tight cover, or what is better,

into tin cans and seal them; then cook in steam-cooker for 
two or three hours. When done, it will be thick, so it can 
be cut into slices like nutmeato or cheese. If desired, a little 
sugar may be added, but it is very palatable without it. 

FRUITOSIA. 

Take ^ cup peanut butter, \ cup of almond meal, | cup 
of walnut meal, or the same of filbert meal, i cup of ground 
figs, i cup of chopped dates, ^ cup of white seedless raisins, 
ground. Look over the raisins, wash and dry again, then 
grind them through the nut mill or meat-chopper, or chop in 
a bowl. Do the same with the dates. Wash the figs; then 
dry, and grind through the nut mill. Have the mill quite 
tightly adjusted and it will grind the seeds up fine. Then 
add the nut butter and nut meal, which should be made first. 
Mix all together thoroughly, and grind through the mill a 
second time. 

FRUITOSIA NO. 2. 

Take i cup of peanut meal, and add \ cup of ground 
prunes. Mix very thoroughly, and grind through the mill. 
Press into a square tin, and cut into caramels; if desired, 
they may be wrapped in oiled paper. 

FRUITOSIA NO. 3. 

Take i pound of dried pears, and A pound of fine nut 
meal of any nut, or a mixture of the meal of different nuts; 
\ pound of almond meal and \ pound of pine-nut meal makes 
a very nice compound. 

Select nice dried pears; wash, and dry by placing in a 
warm place. When perfectly dry, grind them through the 
mill, mix with the nut-meal, and grind again. It is then 
ready to press into square tins, and cut into caramels.

IOO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

FRUITOSIA NO. 4. 

Select good evaporated peaches or apricots, wash well, 
and place on tins in a warm oven until perfectly dry. Then 
grind through a nut mill, mix with the fruit an equal quan- 
tity of peanut rneal, and grind through the mill a second time. 
Press into square tins and cut into caramels. 

Other dried fruit may be used in the same way, but fresh 
fruits can not be used, as the water in the fruit will cause the 
nuts to spoil in a very few days. 

BUTTER FOR TABLE. 

Put one half the amount of butter required for a meal 
into a bowl, and dilute with an equal quantity of water, add- 
ing a little at a time, and beating it thoroughly with a fork 
until it is perfectly smooth and light. An egg beater, wire 
potato-masher, or whip are excellent utensils for this purpose. 
Enough water should be used to make it of the proper con- 
sistency to spread nicely. A little salt can be added if de- 
sired, or the salt may be sprinkled on after it is spread upon 
the bread. 

Some prefer to use it without the addition of water ; but 
in this form it is quite sticky, and adheres to the mouth, and 
has a strong peanut taste. 

By using the water these objections are removed, and a 
sweet, savory taste is imparted. 

If any is left, it should be kept in a cool place, as it 
spoils easily after water has been added.

ROAST GOOSE. 

Take 6 tablespoonfuls of zwieola, pour over it 2\ cups 
of water, and let it soak for fifteen minutes. Then add 4 
hard-boiled eggs, which have been sifted through a fine sieve, 
and the yolks of 3 eggs, and the white of i. Save the whites 
of the other 2 eggs for the basting. Mix well; take out about

one third of the mixture and put in another bowl, and to the 
remaining two thirds, add 4 tablespoonfuls of pecan meal, 2 
tablespoonfuls of roasted pine-nut butter, I heaping teaspoon- 
ful sage, and 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of grated onion, and salt 
to suit the taste. Mix well. Use this mixture for making 
the back and legs of the goose. Then to the one third that 
was taken out, add 2 tablespoonfuls of nut meal made from 
toasted almonds, I tablespoonful of blanched filbert meal, 



I.O2 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

and I tablespoonful roasted pine-nut meal, a little salt, a lit- 
tle sage, and I teaspoonful of onion juice; this mixture is to 
make the breast and wings of the goose. Take some good, 
strong macaroni, break it into desired lengths for the bones. 
Place some of the pecan mixture on a well-oiled tin or sheet 
of iron, on which you wish to bake it, and shape it into the 
form of a goose lying on its back. Press into it a stick of 
macaroni running the whole length, for the backbone. Then 
build it up with the mixture, pressing it down well. Oil the 
hands, and form the legs, pressing a stick of macaroni into 
the center, and have it long enough to reach the whole length 
of the leg, covering it up at the upper end, but letting it stick 
out about an inch at the other to represent the drumstick of 
a goose leg. Then with the almond mixture form the breast 
of the goose, making it quite high, but not so high and full as 
that of a chicken. The neck and lower part of the body 
should be made of the pecan mixture, to represent the dark 
meat of the fowl. Press the legs on to the body, using a lit- 
tle of the white of an egg to stick them on with. It is also 
best to insert some pieces of macaroni, running it through the 
leg just below the leg bone, and into the body, covering up 
the end of it with a little of the dark mixture. This will help 
to hold the legs in position while it is baking. Make the 
wings of the almond mixture, fastening them to the body in 
the same way that the legs were. Then with a knife, smooth 
the surface of the goose, and brush it over with a soft cloth 
wet in peanut oil, and place it in the oven to bake. The 
oven should be of a moderate temperature, and it should bake 
for one hour; then remove from the oven, and spread with a 
mixture of I egg well beaten and I tablespoonful of almond 
butter. Return to the oven, and let it bake until it is nicely 
browned. Take from the oven, and slide it carefully on to 
the platter on which it is to be served. Garnish to suit the

taste and convenience; the one in the accompanying cut is 
garnished with parsley and sliced yolks of hard-boiled eggs. 
A gravy should be served with it made of i heaping table- 
spoonful of roasted pine-nut butter, i heaping tablespoonful 
of white flour, i pint of water, and a little salt. 

TURKEY LEGS. 

Take 5 cup of water, 2 hard-boiled eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of pecan meal, i teaspoonful peanut butter, a little sage and 
salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of zwieola, and 2 tablespoonfuls of glu- 
ten. Boil the eggs until the yolks are dry and mealy, and 
then rub both the whites and yolks through a fine wire sieve. 
Mix with it the nut meal and butter, rubbing until smooth; 
then add a very little water. Pour ^ cup of water over the 
zwieola, let it soak for a few minutes; add the other mixture, 
beating well, and lastly add the gluten. It should be stiff 
enough to handle well. Take a large, heaping tablespoonful, 
press it around the piece of macaroni, which should be four 
or five inches long, forming it in the shape of a turkey leg, 
leaving an inch or more of the macaroni to stick out to rep- 
resent the bone. Roll in beaten egg, and bake on an oiled 
tin until a nice brown. This makes a pretty dish, and is 
very palatable. Serve with a pecan gravy with egg. 

CHICKEN LEGS. 

First prepare the meat of the mock chicken by mixing 2 
tablespoonfuls of pecan meal, i tablespoonful nut butter, and 
^ cup of hickory cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of zwieola, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of gluten, i cup of water. Put the water on the 
zwieola, and let it soak a few minutes, then add the other 
ingredients. It should be just moist enough to form well. 
Then take i large tablespoonful, and roll it in the hands; 



IO4 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

have ready some pieces of macaroni about live inches long, 
and press one into the mixture, leaving out an inch or more 
to represent the bone of the chicken leg, having the macaroni 
in the center for the bone. Roll in beaten egg, place on an 
oiled tin, and bake in a moderate oven until nicely browned, 
which will take about one hour. If a little sage or onion is 
added, it improves the taste very much. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

To make a good-sized turkey, take 20 heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of zwieola, 20 tablespoonfuls of No. 3 gluten, 8 table- 
spoonfuls of pecan meal, 8 tablespoonfuls of roasted almond 
meal, 8 tablespoonfuls of black walnut meal, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of peanut butter, 3 heaping teaspoonfuls of ground sage, 2 
tablespoonfuls of grated onion, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, 6 hard- 
boiled eggs, and 3 raw eggs. Put the zwieola in a large 
pan and pour over it 5 cups of hot water, and let it soak 
for fifteen minutes ; then put the hard-boiled eggs through a 
sieve and add them to the zwieola ; add also the nut butter 
dissolved in water, beat the eggs and add them to the mix- 
ture with the other ingredients. Mix all very thoroughly ; if 
it is so dry_that it is crumbly, add more water, being careful 
not to get it too soft or it will not hold in shape well. A 
piece of sheet iron is nice to bake it on, as it can be more 
easily slipped off. Oil it with nut oil, and place on top of it 
a thick piece of muslin saturated with oil ; upon this cloth 
form a turkey, making the breast full and high, and leaving a 
little piece for the neck. Press it together with the hands, 
oiling them with nut oil to keep them from sticking. Then 
take a large tablespoonful of the mixture into one hand, and 
press into the center of it a large-sized stick of macaroni, 
which is long enough to protrude about two inches, after run-

ning the length of the leg ; with the hands oiled, shape it into 
the form of a turkey leg, using the white of an egg to make 
it stick to the body, and secure it by sticking pieces of 
macaroni through the leg, just below the bone, into the body, 
carefully covering the end of the macaroni with a little of the 
mixture. Form the wings and attach them to the body in 
the same way in which the legs were secured. When the 
fowl is all formed and smooth, brush it over with a cloth 
dipped in nut oil, then bring up the cloth around the turkey 
and pin it together tight enough to hold the wings and legs 
in position. Then place in the oven and bake for an hour 
and a half. Remove from the oven, unpin the cloth, and 
with the shears cut off as much of it as possible without mov- 
ing the turkey ; spread the turkey with a mixture of beaten 
egg and roasted almond butter with a little salt added. Re- 
turn to the oven and bake to a nice brown. Again remove 
from the oven and slide it into the platter on which it is to 
be served. The garnishing, in the cut, is cubes of cranberry 
jelly and parsley. 

NUT LOBSTER. - 

Take i pound of pine-nuts, wash and put them in the 
oven, and roast to a light-brown color; then grind or mash 
them to a butter. To 1.1 cups of this butter take i.i cups 
of water, i cup of corn-starch, i heaping teaspoonful of salt, 
and i heaping tablespoonful of granola ; mix all together 
thoroughly, put into a basin and steam for one hour, then 
bake until nicely browned on top. Cut in slices and serve.

oughly and beat for five minutes. Make a bag of thick mus- 
lin, cutting it out the shape of a fish, and sew it up on a 
machine, having the stitch quite short, so the mixture will not 
work through. Leave a hole in the end of the tail large 
enough to insert a small funnel, and pour the mixture into 
the funnel, letting it run down into the bag. The above 
mixture is sufficient to make a trout eight inches long. When 
full, tie it with a stout twine, lay it on a tin so the back will 
be up, and steam in a steam-cooker for one hour. Remove 
from the cooker, and with the shears or sharp knife rip the 
bag open from the head to the tail, and carefully pull it off 
from the fish. Take a raw potato and cut it into quite thin 
slices lengthwise ; cut one of the slices in the shape of a 
fish's tail-fin, cutting ridges in it to represent the bones, and 
slightly notch it on the end. Cut a slash in the tail of the 
fish and insert the fin, using a little of the white of an egg, and 
fastening it with two pins, which, after the fish is baked, 
should be removed. With another slice of potato form the 
back fin, and cut a slash in the back long enough to insert 
the potato fin ; also insert small slices of potato made to 
represent the gills and the fins near the gills. Then with a 
little charcoal and water (part of a charcoal tablet will do) 
rub the head and back with it, making the head almost black, 
and the back quite a dark drab, but growing lighter down on 
the sides. With a sharp knife cut a mouth and some small 
round holes for the eyes, filling the cavities of the eyes with 
cranberry jelly cut round ; also stick some small round pieces 
of the jelly on -the sides of the fish to represent the red spots 
of a trout. Then beat the white of an egg just enough to 
break it, but not enough to make it frothy ; baste the fish 
with this, being careful not to move the jelly, but be sure and 
cover each piece with egg, so it will not melt when heated in 
the oven. Place in the oven for the egg to set and the

potato fins to slightly brown. When done, put on a platter, 
garnish with parsley, and serve with mashed potatoes. 

MOCK FISH STUFFED AND BAKED. 

Take 6 cups of water ; I } 2 cups of white corn grits or white 
corn-meal ; I teaspoonful of salt. 

When the water boils, add the salt and stir in the grits, 
continuing to stir until it boils ; let it boil gently for a few 
minutes, and then place in a steam-cooker, and steam for 
three or four hours. Make a stuffing of 2 tablespoonfuls of 
zwieola, I tablespoonful gluten No 3, 2 tablespoonfuls pecan 
meal, and I tablespoonful peanut butter, I tablespoonful 
almond butter, I hard-boiled egg, ^ teaspoonful sage, I tea- 
spoonful grated onion, ^ teaspoonful salt ; add just a little 
water until the mixture makes a stiff batter. Mix thoroughly. 
When the corn grits are done, oil a bake tin and put some of 
the cooked grits on it, spreading them in the form of a fish, 
making it as long as can be easily served on the platter you 
intend to serve it on. Then put some of the dressing the 
whole length of the fish. Make a little trough in the dressing, 
and put in the yolks of two eggs, chopped and seasoned with 
celery salt, then cover the egg with the dressing paste, and 
cover that with the cooked grits. Form more perfectly into 
the shape of a fish, and spread with a diluted nut butter, 
using the slices of the white of egg for the gills and mouth, 
and filberts for the eyes. Press in a row of blanched Jordan 
almonds down the center of the back to represent the dorsal 
fins, also use the almonds to make the tail. Lard it across 
the back (see cut) by sticking in pine-nuts. Bake in a moder- 
ate oven for half an hour ; if it browns too fast on top, cover 
with a brown paper, until ten minutes before taking from the 
oven. Garnish with parsley and curled celery, bank the sides

with potato balls made by cutting them from raw potatoes 
with a scoop made for the purpose, or make balls of mashed 
potatoes. Roll them in pine-nut butter and bake in the oven 
until nicely browned. To make the curled celery, take some 
nice crisp celery, split it into four parts from both ends, leaving 
about one inch in the center to hold it. Place it into ice-cold 
water for twenty minutes and it will be curled nicely. If the 
water is not very cold, leave it in longer. 

SAUCE FOR BAKED FISH.. 

Take I cup of raw nut milk, i level tablespoonful of white 
flour, i egg, a little celery, and a pinch of salt. Heat the 
milk in a double boiler, when boiling, stir in the flour, which 
should be rubbed smooth in a little cold water, and let it 
cook for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then add the well-beaten 
egg, the celery, and the salt ; stir until the egg is set, but not 
curdled. If desired, a hard-boiled egg cut into small pieces 
may be added just before serving. Serve a ladleful on one 
side of each portion of fish. Lemon or tomato juice may be 
added if a sour gravy is desired. 

MOCK TURKEY. 

Take 3 cups of sifted lentils, i cup of walnut butter, i 
pound of zwieback moistened with water, 3 heaping teaspoon- 
fuls of powdered sage, i cup of gluten, and 2 teaspoonfuls 
of salt. Add 2 eggs. Form into loaf or turkey. The wal- 
nuts should be the black walnuts, as they give it more of a 
turkey flavor. The whole-wheat zwieback is best, but the 
white will do. Beat the eggs well, and mix all the ingre- 
dients together, adding enough water to the zwieback to 
moisten it before adding the other ingredients. If formed 
into a turkey, it should be real stiff, but it does not require 
to be so stiff when cooked in a loaf.

them dry with a cloth, being careful not to bruise them, 
arrange on a plate, and pile the balls upon them, as is shown 
in the cut. In serving, put a lettuce leaf on an individual 
dish, and place a ball upon it. If a gravy is served with it, 
it should be a white gravy made of almond nut or raw peanut 
milk, flavored with celery or onion.

which have been pressed through a sieve. Mix all together 
thoroughly; and if there is not enough water to mix well, add 
cold water, being careful that you do not get it too moist. 
Have ready a bag made of thick muslin cut and sewed so it 
will be round on the bottom end of the bag, and round out 
through the middle, so that the roast, after being cooked in it, 
will be the shape of a nice ham. Pour boiling water over the 
bag and wring out; then fill with the mixture; tie with stout 
twine, leaving only a little room for swelling, as the more 
room that is left for swelling, the less firm the roast will be, 
and it wants to be firm enough to slice well. Then place it 
in the top of a steam-cooker, or it can be laid in an ordinary 
steamer, and cook for three hours. Then remove from the 
steamer, and with a sharp knife or the shears, rip down one 
side of the roast, pull back the bag, and let the roast roll out 
on an oiled tin or dripping-pan; then with some peanut oil 
and a piece of clean muslin, brush the roast over the top with 
the oil and set in the oven until it has a beautiful brown 
crust. Then carefully remove to a platter and garnish as 
desired. In the accompanying cut it is garnished with vege- 
tables which can be prepared the day before. The round 
balls at the ends are made of potatoes and beets, the beets 
being at one end and the potatoes at the other end of the 
roast. Next to them are cups cut out of cooked turnips. 
They are filled with canned peas, and the central garnish is 
made from cooked carrots cut into cylindrical shapes of even 
lengths. The ornamental skewer or hatclet in the center of 
the roast is made by running a knitting-needle through a 
beet ball, then through a slice of turnip which has had a 
square piece cut out from the center, and four half square 
pieces around that, with pieces of beet inserted in their 
places, then a potato ball, and lastly a small piece of maca- 
roni in which are 2 leaves of parsley. 



Il8 GUIDE FOR NUT <<>(>KKRY. 

The skewer must not be made until just before serving, 
but the other garnish may be fixed the day before and then 
placed in the steamer in time to get warm before arranging 
on the platter; a part of the garnish may be served with a 
slice of the roast if desired, or it can be left undisturbed. A 
gravy should accompany the roast to the table; it may be 
made in the following manner : 2 tablespoonfuls of filbert 
meal, I of peanut butter, i teaspoonful of onion juice, salt to 
taste, and a heaping tablespoonful of white flour. Mix all 
well together with \ cup of water, and stir into 3 cups of 
boiling water. Cook for three minutes, pour into a gravy-boat, 
and place on one side of the carver's plate. This will make 
;i good-sized roast, sufficient for twelve people.

RED BEAN ROAST. 

Take i can or 2 cups of red kidney bean pulp, A cup of 
liquid (milk or water), i cup of rolled English walnuts, or | 
cup of black walnuts, i teaspoonful of sage, I of salt. Mix 
together thoroughly, and bake. 

CRYSTAL WHEAT ROAST. 

Take I cup of crystal wheat, I cup of boiling water ; steam 
fifteen minutes ; then stir into it i cup of nut butter after moist- 
ening it with enough water to make it creamy ; salt, and bake 
in moderate oven twenty minutes, or steam twenty minutes. 
Then cool, and turn out of the pan, basting it with nut but- 
ter, and brown it in the oven. 

A sauce to be served with it is made of i pint of strained 
tomatoes, -J tablespoonful of nut butter, juice of half a lemon, 
and a little salt. 

Sift the hard-boiled yolks in with the bread-crumbs and 
nut meal, add salt and onion, then the raw yolk of an egg, 
and enough nut cream to make it somewhat mushy. 

ESCALLOPED MOCK SALMON. 

Steam i cup of browned rice twenty minutes. Place in a 
baking pan a layer of the mock salmon cut in small pieces, 
then a layer of the browned rice, and so on, until the pan is 
filled. Cover the top with a generous sprinkling of pine-nut 
meal, after pouring in a little boiling water to moisten it. 
Bake in a moderate oven.

sage and salt to make desirable seasoning, and pour over the 
bread. Bake in a shallow pan until well done and brown. 

SAVORY LENTILS, 

Soak a portion of lentils overnight, skirn them from .this 
water, and put in cold water, raising gradually to boiling-point. 
\V hen thoroughly tender, pass them through a reasonably fine 
colander. To one part of this add an equal measure of fine, 
toasted bread-crumbs, also salt and sage, onion or some other 
herb as taste may dictate. Moisten the whole with a quan- 
tity of very thin emulsified butter. When all are combined, 
the consistency should be such that if left to stand a few min- 
utes, it will become even over the top. Bake until quite firm 
and brown. 

A NUT CHEESE NEST. 

Take i ^ cups of raw peanut butter, i cup of corn-meal 
(white), 3.^ cups of water, and i cup of lemon-juice. Mix 
all the ingredients thoroughly and cook the same as nutmeato. 
When thoroughly cold, crumble into very fine pieces and heap 
upon a large, round plate. Make a cavity in the top of the 
mock cottage cheese, and place in it the yolks of 4 hard- 
boiled eggs. Around the edge of the cheese, put a row of 
parsley as shown in the accompanying cut, or some may pre- 
fer watercress.

thoroughly. Take a large tablespoonful, and work in the 
hands quickly, handling with care, and form into cylinder- 
shaped croquettes, making the ends as square across as pos-

sible ; then roll them in a beaten egg and then in gluten, or 
what is better, fine cracker-crumbs ; crisps or rolls that are 
perfectly dry and ground fine are also nice, and give them 
more of a meaty flavor. Bake on well-oiled tins for an hour 
or more. The above amount will make twenty good-sized 
croquettes. In serving, they can be arranged as in the 
accompanying cut, which represents them garnished with 
sprigs of parsley, or if a smaller quantity is desired, they may

be made into funnel shapes by molding in an ice-cream mold 
or a small funnel with the hole stopped up with a piece of 
raw turnip or potato. Then when baked, they are nice 
served on a plate covered with curly lettuce leaves ; serve a 
lettuce leaf with each croquette, placing the croquette upon 
the leaf. 

MOCK FRIED OYSTERS. 

Scrape some parsnips and cut slantwise to get the oval- 
shaped slice. Let them stand in cold water for half an hour. 
Then put into a saucepan, putting on plenty of cold water, 
and let it get boiling hot, and drain. Cover them with boil- 
ing water, and add i teaspoortful of salt, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
nut meal, cook until tender, and drain. When cold, dip the 
slices into a mixture of egg and nut cream whipped together, 
and then in roasted pine-nut butter, rubbed with an equal 
quantity of corn-meal. Place on oiled tins and bake in a 
quirk oven. 

EGG BUTTER. 

Take I pint of raw nut milk, and cook it for three hours 
in a double boiler,, stirring it quite often to keep it from get- 
ting lumpy. Then to i cup of the cooked milk to which has 
been added i teaspoonful of salt, add i level tablespoonful of 
white flour, which has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
water, and let it cook in the double boiler for fifteen or 
twenty minutes, that the flour may be well cooked ; then add 
the well-beaten yolk of i egg, and if desired, a little thick, 
raw peanut cream may also be added to give it more rich- 
ness. Do not cook but a minute after the egg and cream are 
added, and stir it constantly or the egg will curdle. Pour 
while hot into a mold (a wooden butter-mold will do if it is 
tight). Wet the mold with cold water, and set in a cool 
place until perfectly cold clear through ; then turn it upon the

butter-dish, and it is ready for use. Some prefer it rather 
than the diluted nut butter. It very much resembles butter, 
and slices and spreads easily. Try it. 

CUTLETS OF POTATO. 

Take a can of nutmeato, one that is about four inches in 
diameter makes the best size ; slice it crosswise into slices 
about half an inch thick. Cut the slices into halves, and then

with a sharp knife trim them to the shape of a meat cutlet. 
Macaroni is used in this instance for the rib bones, pressing 
it into the nutmeato. Dip first in a batter of egg, water, and 
flour, and then lay it in a platter of meal, made by rubbing 
together pine-nut butter and corn-meal, half and half, turning 
it until enough adheres to coat it over thoroughly. Place on

.1 baking pan and brown in the oven. Have ready some 
nicely boiled potatoes, mashed and beaten to a foam, adding 
a little salt and nut cream, if desired. Heap them upon the 
center of a large platter, leaving them in a loose fluffy way. 
Then take the cutlets from the oven and set them up around 
the potatoes, as shown in the accompanying cut. Serve 
very hot. 

MOCK OYSTER PATTIES. 

Make a pastry dough by using i cup of fine almond meal 
or pine-nut meal, i cup of white flour, and enough cold water 
to mix. Mix the meal and flour, pour on the water a little at 
a time, and stir into crumbs, removing them to the board as 
fast as they form, and then press together and roll out half an 
inch thick. Cut out the patties with a scalloped cooky-cutter, 
and with a small round cutter placed in the center of the 
patty, cut half-way through the dough. Place on oiled tins, 
and bake in the oven the same as biscuits. \Yhen taken 
from the oven, remove the crust on the central part of the 
patty with a fork, saving it as a cover. Then with a fork 
remove all the inside, leaving only a good thick crust. 

Have ready some vegetable oysters which have been well 
prepared and sliced slantwise, so as to give them more of an 
oyster shape. To 4 medium-sized oysters cut in this way, add 
i heaping tablespoonful of rolled oats, a pinch of salt, and 
enough water to cover them. Put into a basin, and cook in 
a steamer for two hours. The oatmeal will give them the 
slimy appearance of real oysters. When done, take out the 
nicest looking oysters on a plate, and put the rest through a 
wire sieve for the gravy. Partly fill the patties with the 
j^ravy, and then finish filling with the oysters. The gravy 
may be seasoned with roasted almond or pine-nut butter ; 
then place the piece of round crust that was taken off, back

on for a lid, and serve hot. The crumbs taken from the inside 
may be used to thicken the soup or gravy if it is too thin. 

GREEN PEA PATTIES. 

Take green peas, or canned peas will do. Make the 
patties the same as for oyster patties. After removing the 
inside of the patties, fill with the peas about two-thirds full, 
and pour over them the juice of the peas thickened with the 
crumbs ; put on the lid, and serve hot. 

NUTMEATO PATTIES. 

Make a puff-paste and cut into patties as directed for 
mock oyster patties. Cut some nutmeato into small cubes, 
cover with water, and cook for two hours in a double boiler ; 
then thicken the juice with a little white flour, add the nut- 
meato and fill the patties ; put on the lid, heat in the oven, 
and serve hot in individual dishes. 

MOCK CHIP BEEF. 

Take plain nutmeato, slice it (or chip it) quite thin, let it 
stand overnight in an open dish covered with a cheese-cloth 
to keep off the dust. The outside will become somewhat dry 
and oily. In the morning broil on toasters or a toasting fork. 
Place in a dish of hot water, and gently simmer for half an 
hour ; then drain off the water, turn the nutmeato upon a hot 
platter, return the water to the stove, and thicken with a 
little white flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water ; add 
salt to suit the taste, and pour over the meat. This may be 
served as chip beef, or it may be placed upon toast.

MALT EXTRACT. 



MALT is any grain artificially germinated, so as to induce 
certain changes in the construction of the seed. Barley 
is the variety of grain usually employed for making malt. 
The barley is first screened, and then poured into a large vat ; 
after which it is covered with six inches of water, the blasted 
kernels and foreign substance being skimmed off. It is left 
in this water from forty to fifty hours, taking less time in sum- 
mer than in winter. The barley is then taken from the vat 
and thickly spread upon a floor where it is left to continue 
sprouting until it reaches a certain point, where the maltser 
knows from experience that the starch of the grain has been 
changed to soluble sugar and dextrin. These changes are 
effected by a peculiar nitrogenous ferment called "diastase," 
which exists in the grain, but is increased in amount during 
the sprouting process. The barley is then kiln-dried and 
ground to a flour. Diastase is obtained by making a paste 
of the malted grain and water, and kept at a temperature of 
76" for a few minutes, when the water is then pressed out, 
filtered, and placed in a warm bath at 170 . At this tem- 
perature the foreign nitrogenous matter coagulates, which is 
afterward separated by filtration. The filtered liquid is 
quite pure diastase, and is evaporated at a low temperature, 
until it is dry. Diastase is not only soluble itself, but it has 
the power of dissolving starch, and is converted into soluble 
gum, to which is given the name "dextrin," and finally into 
grape-sugar, so called because, on analysis, it closely resem- 
bles the sugar which naturally exists in the grape. 
t'34] 



MALT EXTRACT. I 3 5 

Diastase is so powerful that i part of it will convert 2,000 
parts of starch to grape-sugar. For this reason it is exten- 
sively used in the preparation of farinaceous foods for infants, 
and in the form of ma]X extract it possesses considerable repji-^ 
tation in pharmacy, being recommended by physicians for 
patients who have lost the power of digesting starch, as the 
digestion of starch changes it to sugar or dextrin, and the 
malt extract produces the same result. Malt extract is very 
sweet, and has the consistency of honey ; it blends nicely 
with nuts, and may also be eaten on grains and bread. It is 
one of the greatest fat-producing food elements made, and is 
especially recommended to persons who find themselves los- 
ing in flesh from any cause, and is equally well adapted to 
persons of all ages. It is, however, a very concentrated 
food, and care should be taken not to eat of it too freely. 

MALTED BUTTER. 

Take 2 cups of butter, I cup of malt, and mix thoroughly. 
When desired to be used on bread, mix in water till of the 
consistency to spread. A little salt may be added to suit 
taste. 

MALTED NUT CARAMELS NO. I. 

Take 2 cups of nut butter, I cup of malt extract, ' cup of 
No. 3 gluten. A little salt may be added if desired. Thor- 
oughly mix ingredients, and mold into squares or any desired 
shape. Let it stand twenty-four hours. This preparation 
will keep well if each piece is wrapped in oiled paper. 
Where the gluten can not be easily procured, browned flour 
may be substituted. The caramels, if dissolved in hot water, 
make a palatable and nutritious drink, and many prefer to 
take them in this way.

will produce the same as the above: 17 ounces of peanut 
mral, 19 ounces of malt extract, 3 ounces of almond meal, 
i ounce of salt.

MALTED NUT CARAMELS NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of pecan meal, i scant cup of malt extract, 
and \ cup of No. 3 gluten meal. Mix well together, and 
press into a square tin. After it has stood twenty-four hours, 
it can be cut into squares, and wrapped in tissue paper if 
desired. 

MALTED NUT CARAMELS NO. 4. 

Take I cup of ground pine-nuts, a little salt, ) 2 cup of malt 
extract, and ? 2 cup of No. 3 gluten. (See index for directions. ) 
Mix all together but do not work more than is necessary, 
or the oil will start. Press it into square tins, and when it 
has stood twenty-four hours, cut into one-inch squares. If 
preferred, it can be wrapped in tissue paper. 

MALTED NUT CARAMELS NO. 5. 

Take I cup of filbert meal, } 2 cup of malt, i tablespoonful 
of gluten, and a little salt. Mix all together thoroughly and 
press in a square tin. Cut in squares after it has stood for 
twenty-four hours, and if it is desired, it can be wrapped in 
tissue paper. This is very good, and is relished by those who 
do not like peanuts. 



MALT EXTRACT. 137 

MALTED NUT CARAMELS NO. 6. 

Take 3 cups of peanut meal No. 2, i cup of malt extract, 
a pinch of salt ; mix well, and mold in square tins. After 
they have stood for several hours, they can be cut into cara- 
mels, and if desired, wrapped in oiled paper. 

NUT FLAKES. 

Take any of the malted caramels, Nos. I, 2, and 6 are 
very nice. Roll them out very thin, as thin as paper if 
possible. A clean clothes-wringer will roll them thinner than 
they can be rolled with a rolling-pin. Then place in a warm 
oven and dry, being careful not to scorch them, as the malt 
scorches easily. 

MALTED PEANUTS. 

Take i.^ cups of peanut meal, ) 2 cup of malt extract, a 
small pinch of salt; rub all together, and dry in the oven or 
where it is warm, being careful not to scorch it. The malt 
scorches very easily. When perfectly dry, grind through the 
mill to a meal, and it is ready to eat. When mixed with 
malt the peanut dries more easily than any other nut. 

MALTED ALMONDS. 

Take i J, cups of almond meal and ^ cup of malt; rub 
together thoroughly, and dry on tins in a warm oven or sus- 
pended over the stove. When very dry, grind to a meal. 

MALTED BRAZIL-NUTS. 

The Brazil-nuts may be blanched first by heating in the 
oven, when the skins will rub off. Then grind them to a 
meal. To i.\ cups of the meal add .> cup of malt extract; 
mix well and dry. When thoroughly dried, grind to a meal. 



(,11I>E 1-OK MT .COOKERY. 



MALTED PINE-NUTS. 

Take i\ cups of pine-nut meal, \ cup of malt extract, and 
mix together very thoroughly. Put in a warm place, and let 
it get perfectly dry. It will take longer to dry than it does 
the peanut. Then grind through the mill to a meal. 

MALTED FILBERTS. 

Blanch the filberts by heating in the oven, and rubbing off 
the skin; then grind to a meal. To i A cups of the meal add 
.', cup of malt extract; mix well, let it dry in a warm place, 
and when well dried, grind to a meal. 

MALTED WALNUTS. 

Take walnut meal that has been made from the blanched 
walnuts, using i }, cups of the meal to \ cup of malt extract; 
a very little salt improves the taste. Mix well, and dry in 
tins in a warm oven. When perfectly dry, grind to a meal. 

The pecan, hickory, and butternut may be malted in the 
same way. 

MALTED CREAM. 

Take I cup of cocoanut (-ream and i cup of malt extract; 
mix very thoroughly, and it is ready to serve. It is excellent 
to eat on bread, granose, or grains, and also serves as a sauce 
for puddings. 

Raw peanut cream or the cream of any nuts may be sub- 
stituted for the cocoanut if desired. The nut butter diluted 
to the consistency of cream and mixed with equal quantity of 
malt also makes a very nice dressing

Warm the oil and malt on the stove and work well, until 
thoroughly blended; or eighty per cent, malt, twenty per 
cent, nut oil, and a little sugar of milk may be added to give 
a pleasant grainy flavor. 

MALT FOOD. 

Take equal parts of malt extract and water, mix well, and 
let boil; stir in a little gluten to thicken. 

MALT GEMS. 

Take 2 cups of water, 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of nut but- 
ter, i tablespoonful of malt extract, 2 eggs well beaten, } 2 
cup of corn-meal, 2 cups of white flour, \ cup of graham 
flour, and a little salt. Have the water very cold, and dis- 
solve the butter with the water, adding a little at a time; 
then add the malt. Beat in the flour until it is smooth, and 
lastly add the eggs, which should be very well beaten. Bake 
in hot gem irons for nearly an hour, the oven being quite hot. 

MALTED SWEET POTATOES. 

Bake the sweet potatoes as usual; then peel and cut into 
slices or into any shapes desired, and dip into a solution of 
\ cup malt, i teaspoonful nut butter, and salt to taste; mix 
well, and when the pieces of potato are dipped into it, place 
them on oiled tins, and bake in the oven. When nicely 
browned, serve hot.

GRAINS. 



/DRAINS are the most nutritious of all foods, and if properly 
vJ cooked and masticated, they are easily digested. The 
grains are all similar in composition, varying in the relative 
amounts of the various elements, such as gluten, albumen, 
casein, and fibrin. They also contain a certain amount of 
starch, which is converted into dextrin, or sugar, fatty mat- 
ters, and also mineral matter and cellulose. The total nutri- 
tive value of the grain foods is nearly three times that of 
meat. Grains approach more closely than other foods the 
proper standard of proportion of the food elements. We are 
told that the system requires six parts of carbonaceous to one 
part of nitrogenous material. Wheat contains exactly the cor- 
rect proportion of the food elements. Bread made from the 
ground whole-wheat kernel is rightly called ' ' the staff of life ; " 
for one could live upon it without other foods, for an indefi- 
nite length of time, without injury to the body, as it contains 
all the elements needed in the body and that, too, in the 
right proportion. 

But even these most nutritious of foods can be cooked 
and eaten in such a way as to be wholly unfit for the 
stomach. 

The following are some of the errors made in cooking and 
eating grains :- 

First. Not cooking them long enough. Many people 
think grains can be cooked in twenty or thirty minutes. This 
is a fatal mistake, and one that has ruined many a stomach. 
Grains consist largely of starch in the form of little cells ; 
each cell is enclosed in a tough, fibrous coat, which the saliva 

I '43 J 



144 r.UIOK FOR XUT COOKERY. 

or the gastric juice does not affect. By prolonged cooking, 
the starch in the cells expands and bursts the cells ; then it 
can be acted upon by the saliva, which changes it to dextrin, 
or sugar. The gastric juice digests only the nitrogenous 
material, so when the starch is __npt digested by the saliva, it 
is apt to ferment in the stomach. 

Second. Not masticating them thoroughly. 1'.. 'cause the 
grains are softened by cooking and do not need to be masti- 
cated in order to render them fine, they are often swallowed 
without being thoroughly mixed with the saliva. This is a 
verv injurious habit. When we consider the fact that masti- 
cation is the only step in the whole process of digestion and 
assimilation given by the all-wise Creator to man to perform, 
it seems that it ought to be given more time than many give 
to it in this age of hurry. 

Third. Grains are often put in bad company. The cus- 
tom of eating sugar and cream or milk on grains is a very 
injurious one, for the sugar combined with milk very readily 
ferments and causes a sour stomach. Either milk or sugar 
would not be so bad alone, but a dressing of nut cream, fruit- 
juice, or some sauces such as fig sauce, would be much more 
wholesome. 

RECIPES FOR THE COOKING OF GRAINS. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 

Put I quart of water in the inner cup of a double boiler. 
When hot, stir into it i cup of cracked wheat, adding a little 
salt if desired. Let it cook rapidly until the kernels cease to 
settle when lifted from the stove ; then place in the outer 
boiler, in which the water should be boiling. Cook four or 
five hours or longer. Serve hot with nut cream or any fruit 
sauce desired. 



GRAINS. 145 

CRACKED WHEAT AND NUTS. 

When i quart of cracked wheat is nearly done and a little 
moist (add water if too dry), sprinkle i cup of chopped nuts 
over it, and close the kettle carefully, and let it steam for 
twenty or thirty minutes. 

Mix the chopped nuts with the wheat as you pour it out 
into the dish. Pecans or walnuts are particularly good in 
this dish. 

ROLLED WHEAT. 

Have boiling 3 cups of water in the inner part of the 
double boiler. Salt to taste, and stir in i cup of rolled 
wheat. \Yhen thickened, place in the outer boiler, in which 
the water should be boiling, and cook three hours. The 
addition of raisins is very good. The raisins should be well 
steamed, and added just before serving. Stewed apples or 
other fruits, either fresh or stewed, may be added in the 
same way. 

GRAHAM MUSH. 

Heat i quart of water in the inner cup of a double boiler. 
When boiling, stir in 2 cups of graham flour which has been 
moistened with i pint of warm water, stirring in slowly. 
When thickened, put in the outer boiler, and cook one hour. 
The above may be varied by adding stoned dates just before 
serving, or steamed raisins or figs chopped in small pieces ; 
or fruit may be added, such as baked sour apples with the 
skins and core removed, peaches, huckleberries, etc. 

GRAHAM GRITS. 

This is a product of the wheat kernel, in which the germ 
of the wheat and the outer layer of the wheat kernel are 
ground into a granular form. As this preparation takes the 

10 



146 GUI UK FOR NUT COOKERY. 

most nutritious part of the wheat kernel, it is an excellent 
food, having the elements in good proportion. 

TO COOK GRAHAM GRITS. 

Heat ^.\ cups of water in the inner part of the double 
boiler. When boiling, salt to taste, and stir in slowly i cup 
of graham or wheaten grits. Let boil for a few minutes until 
thickened, and place in the outer boiler, partly filled with 
boiling water. Cook for three hours or longer. It does not 
hurt it to cook all night. 

FARINA. 

Heat i quart of nut milk, or water if preferred, in the 
inner cup of the double boiler. When boiling, stir in 5 table- 
spoonfuls of farina, moistened with a little cold water. Let 
it boil until it thickens, then place in the outer boiler, and 
cook for one hour. If cooked in water, it should be served 
with nut cream or something which contains nitrogenous ma- 
terial as the farina is made from the central part of the wheat 
kernel, and consists principally of starch. 

OATS. 

In nutritive value, the oat ranks next to wheat. It is 
rich in fats as well as bone- and muscle-making material. It 
is therefore an excellent article for food if properly prepared ; 
but, like other grains, it has too often been served in an under- 
done state. It is somewhat harder of digestion than wheat, 
but is considered by some as excellent for some forms of 

dyspepsia. 

OATMEAL MUSH. 

Pour into the inner part of the double boiler I quart of 
water. When hot, stir into it i cup of rolled oats, and let it 
boil rapidly until it thickens ; then set in the outer part of the 



GRAINS. 147 

double boiler ; the water in it should be boiling. Cook three 
hours or more. It will not hurt them to cook all night, and 
may be cooked on a coal stove all night, and be ready for 
breakfast. If desired, salt may be added to the water before 
adding the rolled oats. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

An excellent gruel may be made by sifting the cooked 
rolled oats through a sieve and adding water to make of the 
right consistency. A little salt and nut butter may be added 
if desired, or a little dairy cream or milk. This gruel is 
excellent for children and invalids. 

BARLEY. 

Barley is not so nutritious as wheat, and is more difficult 
to digest. Pearl barley is the most common form in which it 
is used. 

To COOK PEARL BARLEY.- -Take i quart of cold water 
in the inner part of a double boiler, salt to taste, and add 
i cup of pearl barley. Place in the outer boiler, and let 
come to the boiling-point slowly. Cook for four or five 
hours, and serve the same as cracked wheat. 

PEARL BARLEY AND NUTS. 

Soak i cup of pearl barley, and i cup of blanched raw 
peanuts overnight. In the morning cook the barley in a 
double boiler and the peanuts in a kettle. (See directions for 
cooking peanuts, i When the peanuts are done, and have 
only a little water, pour them in with the barley, carefully 
fold them in, and let them continue to cook for an hour 
or more. 



148 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

RICE. 

Rice is a grain very easy of digestion. It is very rich in 
starch, but lacking in the nitrogenous elements, therefore it 
should be eaten with some foods that have an excess of that 
element, as nuts, legumes, eggs, or milk. 

STEAMED RICE. 

Look over and thoroughly wash the rice. To i cup of 
rice add 2 cups of water, and 2 cups of nut milk; salt to 
taste. Place in a steamer, and steam one hour, stirring occa- 
sionally with a fork, lifting it up to keep it from being soggy. 
Serve hot with cream or any sauce desired. 

BROWNED RICE. 

Put a quantity of rice in the Family Peanut Roaster 14 or 
5 pounds can be roasted at a time if desired), and place over 
a wood- or gas-stove. If the latter is used, it will take con- 
stant but slow turning ; it is not necessary that it should be 
turned fast. Watch closely. When done, it should be of 
a yellowish-brown color. Use i cup of rice to 2 cups of 
water. Add a little salt. Steam the same as the above 
recipe. When done, each kernel should be separate, dry, 
and mealy. It is very palatable eaten without a dressing, 
but can be eaten with nut cream or with a fruit sauce if 
desired. 

BROWNED RICE SOUFFLE. 

Take i cup of browned rice, steam it in 3 cups of water 
for twenty-five minutes. When cold, add i cup of sifted to- 
mato pulp. Beat 4 eggs, the whites and yolks separately, 
add the yolks first, and fold in the stiffly beaten whites last, 
turn into an oiled pan, and bake in a quick oven for twenty 
minutes. Serve immediately. 



GRAINS. 149 

GOLDEN RICE. 

Take i cup of rice, 2\ cups water, and \ cup nut cream; 
mix well, and steam for forty-five minutes. Then add i egg, 
which should be well beaten, and steam just long enough to 
set the egg. Serve on a flaring platter or large plate with 
poached egg on top. 

RYE. 

In nutritive value, rye is nearly equal to wheat, but has a 
taste not relished by some. 

ROLLED RYE. Put 3 cups of water in the inner cup of a 
double boiler. When boiling, add salt to taste, and stir in 
slowly i cup of rolled rye. Let it boil until it thickens, and 
then place in the outer boiler, and cook for three hours or 
more. 

RYE MUSH. 

Heat 3 cups of water to boiling in the inner dish of a 
double boiler, add salt to taste, and stir into it i cup of rye 
graham flour moistened with i cup of warm water. Stir until 
thickened, then place in the outer boiler, the water in which 
should be boiling. Cook for one hour or more. 

MACARONI. 

This is a wheat product ; the outer skin or bran is rejected, 
but the glutinous part of the wheat is saved. When properly 
cooked, it is nutritious and palatable ; it serves as a basis for 
a variety of soups as well as other dishes. 

To BOIL MACARONI. --Take i cupful of macaroni which 
has been broken into pieces one inch in length. Drop them 
into boiling hot, salted water, and cook until tender, which 
will take from thirty to forty-five minutes. When tender,

drain off the water in which it was cooked, and serve with 
almond cream and sugar. A little vanilla may be added to 
the cream if desired. 

MACARONI WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

Cook the macaroni as in the preceding recipe, and cover 
with the following gravy : Heat I pint of nut milk to boiling. 
Salt to taste, and thirkrn with I level tablespoonful of white 
flour. Lastly add ^ cup of strained tomatoes. Pour over 
the macaroni and serve hot. Less nut milk and more tomato 
may be added if desired. 

MACARONI WITH ZWIEOLA. 

Boil the macaroni in salted water until tender; drain, and 
place a layer of it in a pudding dish. Sprinkle over it a little 
xwieola, and add another layer of macaroni, and so on, 
having a sprinkling of zwieola on top. Cover it with nut 
cream and, if desired, i egg may be added to the cream. 
Place in the oven, and bake. 

MACARONI WITH EGG SAUCE. 

Cook the macaroni as in the recipe for boiled macaroni; 
drain, and pour over it the following sauce : Heat i pint of 
nut milk to boiling. Take i teaspoonful of white flour, and 
dissolve in a little cold water, add the yolk of i egg and 
a little salt. Beat well, and stir into the nut milk, which 
should be boiling gently. Pour over the macaroni, mix, 
and serve hot. 

MACARONI WITH CORN. 

Boil i cup of macaroni which has been broken into inch 
lengths, in boiling, salted water until tender. Drain and 
add to it i cup of corn cut from the cob or i cup of canned 



(.KAixs. 151 

corn, a little salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of zwieola, i egg well 
beaten, and i .1 cups of nut milk. Mix thoroughly, and bake 
in a granite pudding dish. 

MACARONI WITH NUTMEATO. 

Boil the macaroni as in the recipe for boiled macaroni, 
then drain and put a layer of it in the bottom of a pudding 
dish, then put over it a layer of nutmeato which has been 
grated or put through a sieve or vegetable press, then a 
sprinkle of minced parsley leaves, then another layer of 
macaroni, and so on, finishing with nutmeato on top. Pour 
over it enough nut milk to moisten it, and bake in the oven. 

CORN. 

Corn contains about three times as much fatty matter as 
the other grains. It is not so easily digested as wheat, and 
is not a suitable diet for some stomachs. Corn contains 9.7 
per cent, of albuminous elements, 69. 5 per cent, of starch, 
3.8 per cent, of free fats, and 1.3 per cent, of salts, making 
a total nutritive value of 84.3 per cent. Corn should be 
cooked a long time in order to make it more digestible. 

CORN MUSH. 

Mix thoroughly together 2 cups of corn-meal, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of white flour, and i pint of warm water. Turn 
this mixture very slowly into i quart of boiling water, stirring 
constantly, and being careful that it does not cease boiling. 
Cook in a double boiler three or four hours. The common 
idea that corn-meal mush can be made in a few minutes is 
what has ruined many a stomach, and made many life-long 
dyspeptics. 



15- GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

CORN-MEAL AND WALNUTS. 

Into 4 cups of boiling water stir i cup of corn-meal; con- 
tinue stirring until it is smooth and quite thick. Then add i 
cup of walnut meal, and pour it into a well-oiled bake-pan, 
and steam it for six hours. Then place in the oven a few 
minutes to brown on top. Cut it in slices, and serve with a 
nut gravy. 

POP-CORN. 

Pop-corn is the smallest of the maize family, and contains 
more oil than the other varieties. When oils are heated to a 
certain degree of temperature, they turn into gas, which, 
although very light, occupies a great deal more space than 
the oil. As it can not escape through the hull of the kernel, 
the pressure finally becomes so great that it bursts the kernel, 
and the explosion also bursts the starch cells, and makes it 
easy of digestion. For this reason, pop-corn forms an excel- 
lent food. Ground pop-corn is excellent eaten with nut milk, 
and can be used in making mushes and puddings. 

POP-CORN POPPED. 

Shell the corn from the cob, and remove the chaff in the 
wind by pouring from one dish to another. Then place in 
Family Peanut Roaster, and set over a gasoline burner or 
gas-stove, and turn the crank until the corn is popped. 

HOMINY AND NUTS. 

When hulled corn or hominy is nearly done, stir into it i 
cup of nut meal to each quart of the hominy. The meal 
made from any nuts may be used, or a mixture of several 
kinds of nuts. 



GRAINS. 153 

PEANUTS AND HOMINY. 

Soak together equal quantities of hominy and blanched 
peanuts in water overnight. Put on the stove early in the 
morning in the same water, and when they have boiled an 
hour or two, or until the water begins to thicken, put them 
in a double boiler, and let them cook eight or nine hours. 

BROWNED MUSH. 

Take mush that is left from the previous day and cut into 
slices about one-half inch thick ; dip first in a beaten egg to 
which has been added i tablespoonful of nut milk, then roll 
in a mixture of corn-meal, pine-nut butter, and a little salt, 
thoroughly mixed. Place on a tin, and bake in a quick oven. 

NUT HASH. 

Any cold cereal, as rice, barley, hominy, grits, etc., chopped 
with an equal quantity of hazelnut meal, and a little water 
added, cooked in the oven for an hour, makes a good change. 
Use Brazil-nuts with rice or sago, almonds with tapioca or 
pearl barley, pecans with hominy or grits.

UNLEAVENED BREADS. 



TTNLEAVENED breads are those made light without the 
U use of yeast, baking-powder, or soda. Since they are 
the most healthful of all breads, it would be of benefit to 
mankind if they were in more general use. 

The principle in making these breads is to incorporate as 
much air as possible into the dough, that when it is baking 
the air may be expanded by the heat, and- cause the bread to 
be light and porous. 

Bread which is raised with baking-powder or soda should 
never be eaten, as it is alkali, and destroys the effect of the 
gastric juice, thus preventing it from doing its work of digest- 
ing the food. Unleavened breads are better than breads 
raised by yeast ; for they contain no yeast germs. The 
strong stomach can destroy these germs, but in the weak 
stomach there is danger of their increasing, and causing 
fermentation. 

THE NUT-BUTTER MILL AS A KNEADER. 

In making the unfermented breads, it will be found of 
great advantage to run the dough through the nut-butter mill 
twice or more, instead of kneading by hand as directed in the 
recipes. At first thought, it may seem that it would be a 
more tedious process ; but experience will demonstrate that a 
half-hour with the mill will produce a much finer-grained and 
a more tender bread than the same time spent in kneading 
by hand. 

For this work, adjust the mill more loosely than for grind- 
ing nuts. 



UNLEAVENED BREADS. 157 

WATER GEMS. 

Take i cup of nut meal, i cup of ice-cold water, and 
whole-wheat or graham flour sufficient to make a batter. 
Beat thoroughly for from five to ten minutes. Bake in hot 
gem irons in a quick oven. 

GRAHAM GEMS. 

Beat together very thoroughly i pint of any kind of nut 
milk, the yolk of i egg, and a pinch of salt. Then add 2\ 
cups of graham flour, adding a little at a time, and beating 
in order to incorporate as much air as possible into the mix- 
ture. When light and foamy, fold in the well-beaten white 
of the egg. Turn into gem irons which have been heated, 
and bake in a rather quick oven for from forty to sixty min- 
utes. Part whole-wheat or white flour may be used instead 
of all graham if preferred. 

RAW PEANUT-BUTTER GEMS, 

Take \ cup of raw peanut butter, i \ cups of cold water, 
2 entire eggs, enough whole-wheat flour to make batter that 
will just pour readily. Dissolve the butter in the water, and 
place in a round-bottomed dish. Add to it the yolks of the 
eggs. Then beat the whites of the eggs until they are very 
stiff, and set in a cool place until the rest is ready. With an 
egg beater beat the milk and yolks until frothy ; then add the 
flour a little at a time, beating continuously with a spoon or 
the egg beater used like a spoon, until the mixture is of the 
desired thickness. Then fold in the whites of the eggs. Do 
not beat, as that will allow the air to escape from the whites; 
but put the spoon down by the edge of the dish, and bring it 
up through the center. Pour into warm and well-oiled gem 



I5<^ GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

irons, and bake in a hot oven. The oven should bake well 
from the top, so that a slight crust will form to keep in the 
air. Bake three fourths of an hour. 

CORN GEMS. 

Take i egg, i), cups of any kind of nut milk, ] cup of 
sugar, i cup of white flour, and \ cup of yellow corn-meal. 
Beat the yolk of the egg, the sugar, and nut milk together, 
Mix the corn-meal and flour, and add a little at a time, 
beating constantly for five or ten minutes. The colder the 
material, the more foamy and light it will become. Then 
add the stiffly beaten white of the egg, and bake in gem 
irons in a moderately hot oven. 

SALLY LUNN. 

Take 2 eggs, 2 cups of cold nut cream (the colder the 
materials, the lighter the gems will be), to which add | cup 
of sugar and 2\ cups of graham flour. Beat yolks of eggs, 
cream, sugar, and salt together ; add the flour slowly, beat- 
ing continuously. Then beat vigorously for five or ten min- 
utes, until it becomes real light and full of air bubbles. Then 
add the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and bake as other 
gems. 

WHOLE- WHEAT GEMS. 

Put the yolk of i egg into a large bowl or round-bottomed 
pan. Add to it i ^ cups of any kind of nut milk, beating 
thoroughly until foamy with air bubbles, after which add a 
small quantity at a time, of whole-wheat flour, beating con- 
tinuously, until 2 cups have been put in. Continue the beat- 
ing for ten minutes more after the last of the flour has been 
added. After it has been beaten as directed, add the stiffly 



UNLEAVENED BREADS. I 59 

beaten white of the egg. Do not beat after egg has been 
added, but turn at once into heated gem irons, and bake in a 
moderate oven for one hour. If properly made, they will be 
as light as bread made with yeast. 

FILBERT GEMS. 

Take i pound of filberts in the shell, remove kernels from 
shells, and grind to a meal. Beat 3 eggs thoroughly, add 3 
cups of water, and beat in 3 cups of whole-wheat or graham 
flour, after which fold in the filbert meal, and bake in very 
hot gem irons in a quick oven. 

CREAM PUFFS. 

Take I cup of raw peanut cream, i cup of very cold water, 
2 eggs, 2\ cups of whole- wheat flour, and a little salt. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs, the water, cream, and salt together ; 
then add the flour, slowly beating for about ten minutes ; 
then add the stiffly beaten whites of the 2 eggs, folding them 
in, and bake in gem irons in a quick oven for nearly an hour. 
The cream from any nuts may be used. 

DELICATE PUFFS. 

Take i cup of very thick hickory-nut cream and i cup ol 
real cold water, or two cups of thin crearn; also 2 eggs, \ cup 
of sugar, 2.t cups of whole-wheat flour, and a little salt. 
Beat the liquid, sugar, salt, and the yolks of the eggs together; 
then add the flour slowly, beating all the time. After the 
flour is in, continue beating for five or ten minutes, until it 
becomes light, and full of air bubbles. Then fold in the whites 
of the eggs, which should be beaten to a very stiff froth. 
Bake in hot gem irons for forty-five minutes. 



l6o GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



CORN PUFFS. 

Take \ cup of yellow corn-meal, I cup of fresh mashed 
potatoes, } 2 cup of nut milk, i egg-, and a little salt. Pour 
the milk over the corn-meal. Add the potatoes, and mix 
thoroughly. Fold in the egg, which has been well beaten 
beforehand. Bake in gem irons in a quick oven. 

CORN-MEAL MUFFINS. 

Take I pint of warm nut milk, i teaspoonful of salt, I cup 
of white flour, i heaping tablespoonful of sugar, and \ cake 
of yeast. Grate or break the yeast-cake up fine. Mix it 
with the other ingredients, and add enough Indian meal to 
make a thick batter. Let rise overnight. In the morning 
add a little peanut oil; let rise again, and pour into gem irons 
only half full. Let rise a few minutes and bake. 

RAISED WAFFLE BATTER. 

Take i quart of sifted flour, i.\ pints of warm nut milk, \ 
yeast-cake, i teaspoonful of salt, ^ tablespoonful of nutcoa. 
Mix all together, and let rise overnight. In the morning add 
2 or 3 well-beaten eggs, and beat into the batter. Let stand 
a short time, and pour into well-oiled, hot gem irons, and 
bake. 

WHOLE-WHEAT PUFFS. 

Take 2 cups of whole-wheat flour, i \ cups of nut milk 
(very cold), 2 eggs, ^ teaspoonful of salt. Make a batter of 
the flour, milk, and salt, and beat for ten minutes. Then 
beat the eggs, the whites and yolks separately, and fold in. 
Pour into well-oiled, warm gem irons, and bake one hour. 



UNLEAVENED I'.KKADS. l6l 

GRAHAM PUFFS. 

Take I .\ cups of graham flour, I cup of white flour, 
2 teaspoonfuls of sugar, i teaspoonful of salt, i large cup of 
nut milk, and 3 eggs. Make a batter with the flour, milk 
(cold), salt, and sugar. Beat the yolks until thick and 
creamy, and beat the whites until stiff and crumbly. Fold 
the yolks into the batter ; then fold in the whites. Pour into 
warm, well-oiled gem irons, and bake one hour. 

MILK GEMS. 

Cook some raw peanut milk in a double boiler for two 
hours, and then set it in a cool place until morning. Then 
take i\ cups of the milk, i egg, a little salt, and enough flour 
to make a gem batter ; put the yolk of the egg in the milk, 
beat well, and add the flour (whole-wheat preferable), beat- 
ing it thoroughly for five or ten minutes ; then add the stiffly 
beaten white. Pour into hot gem irons and bake nearly 
an hour. 

SWEET POTATO GEMS. 

Take i.i cups of mashed sweet potato, sift thoroughly 
through a sieve or colander, add 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, a 
little salt, i tablespoonful of nut cream, and i tablespoonful 
of malt or sugar; mix well, and add 2 cups of nut milk; 
beat, pour into gem irons, and bake. If the gem irons are 
not available, bake in the form of cakes on a griddle. 

BEATEN BISCUIT. 

Take i cup of water, i cup of raw peanut cream, .\ tea- 
spoonful of salt, and as much flour (whole-wheat) as can be 
kneaded in. Mix all together well, knead it very stiff, roll it 
out a little, sprinkle with flour, fold over, and beat with a 



1 62 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

wooden potato masher or hammer, beating around the edges 
first, so as to keep in all the air possible. Continue this proc- 
ess until the dough is very elastic, and will give a sharp sound 
if a piece is broken off quickly. The same result will be 
obtained if the dough is pulled like taffy candy, instead of 
beating it, and it makes much less noise. When the dough 
is elastic, cut into small pieces about the size of a walnut, 
and roll into a round biscuit, then with the thumb and finger 
press a hole through the center of the biscuit ; this will give 
it a chance to expand more, making the biscuit light. Place 
on perforated tins, and bake in a moderate oven for one hour. 

RAW-BUTTER ROLLS NO. J. 

Take 2.\ cups of flour (seconds), i cup of raw nut butter, 
'I cup of water, and a pinch of salt. Sift and measure the 
flour. Dissolve the butter in the water, working until it is 
smooth and creamy. Add the salt, and pour into the flour a 
little at a time, working it with a spoon or the hand as in 
making a suds of water and soap. This will make it foamy, 
and introduce more air into the mixture. When part of the 
cream has been wet with the flour, remove to the cake-board, 
and pour in more cream on the flour, and " suds '' as before. 
When all the cream has been used, put the pieces together 
and knead thoroughly for ten minutes, after which roll it out 
into a roll as smooth as possible, and about an inch in diame- 
ter. Cut into any lengths desired, and bake in a moderately 
hot oven until thoroughly baked, which may require nearly 

an hour. 

ROLLS NO. 2. 

The following recipe can be varied by using whole-wheat, 
graham, or pastry flour; also, if preferred, a mixture of differ- 
ent kinds, as half graham and half white flour, which is bet- 
ter than all graham. Whole-wheat is considered the best. 



UNLEAVENED BREADS. 163 

To i cup of best whole-wheat flour, take f of a cup of 
peanut meal, and about } 2 cup of water- -enough to make a 
very stiff dough. Knead for ten or fifteen minutes, until the 
dough will make a snapping sound when a piece is pulled out 
quickly. Then roll with the hands until about three fourths 
of an inch in diameter ; cut into desired lengths, and bake on 
roll bakers in a moderate oven for one hour. 

ROLLS NO. 3. 

To i cup of flour, take .\ cup of almond meal, and nearly 
.', cup of water, which ought to make a very stiff dough. 
Knead for ten or fifteen minutes, form into rolls about of 
an inch in diameter, cut into desired lengths, and bake on 
roll bakers, in an oven moderately heated, until thoroughly 
baked. Nearly an hour will be required. 

Almond butter or peanut butter may be used, if desired, 
in place of almond meal. 

ROLLS NO. 4. 

To i cup of raw peanut cream (use care not to have it too 
thick ; and if it should be too rich, add an equal quantity of 
water), add a pinch of salt, and enough whole-wheat flour to 
make a very stiff dough. Knead until the dough becomes 
quite elastic, and will make a snapping sound when a piece 
of dough is quickly pulled off. The more stiffly the dough is 
kneaded and worked, the better the quality of the rolls 
will be. 

ROLLS NO. 5. 

Take \ cup of cocoanut cream, i cup of cold water, a 
pinch of salt, and sufficient whole-wheat flour to make a very 
stiff dough. Whole-wheat flour is more nutritious than the 
white, as it contains more gluten, salts, and phosphate. 



164 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

Lighter and crisper rolls can be made by its use. Knead the 
mixture until it becomes very elastic, and make into rolls 
about three fourths of an inch thick, and cut two inches long. 
They are better if baked on roll bakers, as the heat can 
reach them equally from all sides. 

ROLLS NO. 6. 

To .\ cup of cream taken from chufa milk, add \ a ciij> 
of water, and a quantity of whole-wheat flour sufficient to 
make a stiff dough. Make the same as Rolls No. 4. 

These are delicious, and also inexpensive, as chufas may 
be raised in nearly all sections of this country. See article 
on "Chufa." 

ROLLS NO. 7. 

Take | cup of pine-nut meal, i cup of white or whole- 
wheat flour, a little salt, and enough cold water to make a 
very stiff dough. For further directions, see Rolls No. i . 

*/ o 

ROLLS NO. 8. 

Any shortening most convenient and cheap may be used. 
Where pecans and hickory-nuts are plentiful, they may be 
used in the form of meal or milk and cream. 

Take i cup of rich hickory-nut or pecan milk, i cup of 
flour, and a small amount of salt. Knead thoroughly. If 
the dough does not become real stiff, add more flour. 

NUT ROLLS. 

Take 2 cups of any cold cooked cereals, and add f cup of 
nut meal. Mix thoroughly, and knead on aboard until smooth 
and firm, using white or whole-wheat flour. Form into rolls 
about the si/e of the finger and bake on roll bakers in a mod- 
erately hot oven.

NUT CRISPS NO. J. 

Make dough as for Rolls No. 2 or No. 3. Roll out as thin 
as brown paper, cut into squares, and bake on perforated 
tins or roll baker until done. 

CRISPS NO. 2. 

'Any dough used in the various kinds of rolls is suitable for 
making crisps. The dough made from the cream is excellent. 

HICKORY-NUT CRISPS. 

Take i^ cups of whole-wheat or graham flour, and thor- 
oughly mix into it A cup of hickory-nut meal. Add salt, and 
sufficient water to knead easily. Roll out as thin as brown 
paper, perforate the dough by means of a fork, in order to 
avoid blistering, and bake in a quick oven. Watch them 
closely to prevent burning. 

NUT STICKS. 

Make a dough similar to that for Rolls No. 2 or No. 3, and 
roll with the hands until it is about the size of a lead-pencil. 
Cut in lengths six inches long, and bake in the oven until a 
light brown. 

STICKS. 

Any dough made for rolls will be equally good for sticks. 
The cream dough is especially good. 

ZWIEBACK. 

To make good zwieback, the bread from which it is made 
should be very light and porous. It should not be new bread 
or bread that is moist, as that kind of bread makes very hard 
and tough zwieback. Bread that is several days old, and that 



1 66 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

has been in a place where it will dry out is the best for 
zwieola. Either graham or white can be used. Cut into 
slices about one half or two thirds of an inch thick ; place in 
a warming oven on a roll baker, or in the oven with the door 
open, so that it will thoroughly dry out before toasting. 
Then the doors may be closed. It should be toasted to a 
light brown. The slices can be cut one inch thick if desired, 
but the thinner it is the more brittle it will be. 

UNLEAVENED BISCUIT. 

Take 4 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of nut butter, 4 cups of 
granose flakes, salt to taste. Beat whites and yolks separ- 
ately, and to the yolks add the nut butter and salt ; beat to 
cream, fold in the stiffly beaten whites ; last of all, quickly 
fold in the granose flakes, not waiting for every flake to be 
moistened. Drop in spoonfuls on oiled tins ; bake fifteen 
minutes, or until lightly brown ; - cup of sugar may be used 
if desired. 

NO. J GLUTEN. 

Take 5 cups of water, 13 cups white flour (Pillsbury's 
Best is one of the best grades of flour to make this, as it con- 
tains more gluten than some grades.) Mix the water and the 
flour into a loaf, knead for ten minutes, and then put in a 
pan and cover with water. Let it stand an hour or more, 
then begin to work with the hands, washing out the starch. 
Wash thoroughly through several waters until the water is 
clear; then wiping the gluten with a clean, dry cloth, cut into 
pieces like small biscuit, and bake in a moderately hot oven, 
being careful not to brown them too much, as that will make 
the gluten dark. Keep it where it is warm until it is thor- 
oughly dried through, and grind through the mill. This will 



UNLEAVENED BREADS. I 67 

be No. i Gluten, and usually costs fifty cents a pound. The 
water in which it was washed can be left in a pan (earthen) 
overnight ; then turn off the water, and the starch which is in 
the bottom can be dried and used in making nutmeato, and 
for other purposes, instead of corn-starch. 

NO. 3 GLUTEN. 

Take i cup of No. i Gluten, 2 cups white flour, enough cold 
water to make a very stiff dough, and as little water as pos- 
sible. Roll into thin crackers, bake in a moderate oven (but 
not brown), break into pieces, and grind in the mill. A grain 
mill is best, as it will make it finer. 



YEAST BREADS. 



HOP YEAST. 

i handful of hops in a cheese-cloth bag, and boil 
in 2 quarts of water for fifteen minutes; then remove the 
bag, and pour the boiling tea over I pint of white flour, 
to which has been added I tablespoonful of salt, pouring 
slowly at first in order to have it smooth and free from lumps. 
If at all lumpy, strain, and when lukewarm, add I cup of 
liquid yeast or i cake of compressed yeast, and set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, put in glass cans, and keep in a 
cool place. 

FRUIT YEAST. 

Take i cup of raisins, wash them well, and put them to 
soak in i ,\ pints of warm water, keeping them in a warm 
place for two or three days, or until fermentation takes place, 
which can be told by the bubbles on top of the water. Then 
make a potato yeast by boiling 4 good-sized potatoes until 
tender; mash fine, or sift through a colander or vegetable 
press. Add i teaspoonful of salt, i tablespoonful of sugar, 
and when cooled to blood-heat, add enough of the raisin 
water to make of the right consistency, which will be about 
2 cupfuls. Let it rise until light, and then put in clean glass 
cans, and keep in a cool place. It is better to be a few days 
old before using. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Peel 4 good-sized potatoes, boil, and mash them. Add 
to them 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, J tablespoonful of salt, i \ 
cups of water, and sift through a sieve to remove all lumps. 
[168] 



YEAST BREADS. 169 

When lukewarm, add A cup of good yeast, and let stand until 
well risen; then put into sterilized glass cans, and keep in a 
cool place. 

QUICK YEAST BREAD. 

The potato yeast is the best for bread making, as the 
bread keeps moist longer, and there is no danger of injuring 
the flavor of the bread by using too much. A fine-grained 
and very sweet bread may be made by raising the dough only 
once, thereby saving time, trouble, and what is far better, the 
sweet flavor and nutrition of the bread. But in order to have 
this bread successful, the yeast must be good and lively. 

To make 3 loaves, take 3 quarts of flour, i small table- 
spoonful of salt, i quart of milk-warm water, I pint of potato 
yeast or i cake of compressed yeast. Sift the flour into the 
bread pan, and form a hollow in the center; put in the salt 
and pour in the water, constantly, stirring with one hand until 
a thin batter is formed; then add the yeast, and mix thoroughly 
until a stiff dough is formed. Then take out on the bread 
board, and knead thoroughly for twenty minutes or more, 
flouring the board to keep it from sticking. Form into loaves, 
put into well-oiled pans, rub over the top a little peanut oil, 
and let it rise until about twice its first size. Then put in a 
moderate oven and bake one hour. The loaves should not 
crust over for the first twenty minutes, and during this time 
they should rise to double the size of the loaf that was put in 
the oven. The pan should be deep enough to retain them in 
shape; then the temperature of the oven should be raised to 
six hundred degrees for about twenty minutes; but the last 
twenty minutes should be quite moderate. 



I"O GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



YEAST BREAD NO. \. 

Dissolve i cake of compressed yeast in i pint of warm 
water, or i cup of good liquid yeast ; and thicken with white 
flour (like Pillsbury's Best) to make a medium stiff batter. Set 
this sponge at nine o'clock in the evening, in a dish large 
enough to have plenty of room to rise. It should be kept at 
a temperature of about sixty degrees. If kept too warm, it 
will be apt to fall before morning. In the morning add i 
pint of warm water in which has been dissolved i heaping 
tablespoonful of nut butter. Almond butter is preferable, as 
it will not make the bread yellow ; if peanut butter is used, 
the peanuts of which it is made should not be roasted very 
brown, only a straw color. Add also i tablespoonful of 
sugar and i teaspoonful of salt. Mix thoroughly with the 
sponge, and lift it up, working in the flour and pulling it at 
the same time. Do not add enough flour to make it very 
stiff ; but pull it until it is very elastic and the hand becomes 
clean of the dough. Then set it to rise the second time. 
When light, mold into loaves, kneading as little as possible. 
Flour them, and put into oiled tins. The loaves should be 
as soft as can be lifted into the tins. Let stand in a warm 
place until twice their original size, and bake in a moderate 
oven. The loaves should not crust over for the first twenty 
minutes ; then it should have a hotter fire for twenty minutes ; 
and then a more moderate fire for the last twenty minutes. 
It should bake one hour. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

It is always best to set the sponge with white flour, for 
the graham flour is more likely to sour, as it contains more 
gluten. When both kinds of bread are to be made, some of 
the white sponge may be taken for making the graham bread.

To I pint of the sponge, add I pint of warm water, i tea- 
spoonful of salt, and I of malt extract. Add enough graham 
flour to make a rather stiff dough. Pull or knead for half an 
hour. Form into loaves, oil with nut oil, and when they 
have risen to twice their original size, place in the oven and 
bake for one hour. The oven should be moderate for the 
first twenty minutes, to give the bread a chance to rise before 
a crust forms ; then the oven should be hot for twenty 
minutes, that all the yeast germs may be killed ; and then 
moderated at the last, so to not burn the crust. When done, 
remove from the tins, and set in a draft, on a tin or a plate, 
until cool. 

STEAMED GRAHAM BREAD. 

Take 3^ cups of graham flour, 2 cups of corn-meal, 3 cups 
of nut milk, I cup of malt extract, I teaspoonful of salt. Mix 
the nut milk, salt, and malt together ; then mix the corn- 
meal and flour, and stir into the liquid. Put into basins or 
baking-powder cans, and steam for two and one-half hours. 
Then brown in the oven for fifteen minutes. 

SALT-RISING BREAD. 

Take a perfectly clean bowl, and one that has not had any 
acid substance like cooked fruit in it. Put in it i cup of 
warm water, \ teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of corn- 
meal, i drop of ginger extract, and enough white flour to 
make a medium thick batter. Beat it very thoroughly, and 
set the bowl in a pan of warm water to secure a uniformity 
of temperature. It will rise in about five hours, sometimes 
more quickly. Much depends upon the flour. When it is 
light, take a pint of quite warm water, and add enough flour 
to make a rather stiff sponge. When lukewarm, add the 
rising, stirring it in well. If kept in a warm place, it ought 



17- r.riDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

to be light in one or two hours. When light, knead into 
loaves. It requires much less kneading than yeast bread. 
When the loaves have risen to twice their original size, bake 
in a moderate oven for nearly an hour. 

BROWN BREAD. 

Select good wheat from the granary or grist-mill, wash it, 
and remove all foreign substances. Soak it overnight. Put 
it in a cloth sack, and steam it until plump, but not soft. 
Spread thin on tins, and roast in the oven until well dried, 
and somewhat brown. Grind through the mill, not making 
an effort to have it very fine. It should be rather coarse. 

To i quart of caramel-cereal coffee, add 2 level table- 
spoonfuls of nut butter. When boiling, stir into it \ cup of 
rye flour, .\ cup of corn-meal, i cup of sugar, and a pinch of 
salt, all of which have been well sifted together. When 
again boiling, remove from the fire, and stir into it enough of 
the prepared wheat to make a very stiff substance. Com- 
pactly press into an oiled pan, cover, and steam three hours. 
Dry in the oven a few minutes, and serve hot. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 

Take I cup of malt extract, i pint (2 cups) of nut cream 
(raw peanut). This must be quite thin cream. If thick 
cream is used, use half water. Take i cup of white flour, 
2 cups of corn-meal. Heat the thin cream in the double 
boiler until it is hot ; but it is not necessary to cook it. 
Then add the corn-meal and malt, and lastly mix in the 
white flour. Steam for three hours, and then place in the 
oven to brown for a little while. The cream of any nuts 
may be used, or the cream made from the diluted nut butter. 
Sugar may be used instead of malt if desired. 



YEAST BREADS. 173 



STEAMED YEAST BREAD. 

The great objection to yeast bread is the yeast germ 
which it contains. In baking, the cooking process can not 
be continued long enough to kill all the germs ; but by steam- 
ing the bread instead of baking it, the cooking can be con- 
tinued for two or three hours, or even longer. Any yeast 
breads may be steamed. After removing from the steamer, 
place in the oven to brown. 

Breads cooked in this way are very light, and much 
sweeter than when baked. 

MUSH BREAD. 

Take 4 cups of hot water, put in the inner cup of a double 
boiler, and set on the stove until it boils. Then stir in i cup 
of corn-meal, adding a little salt if desired. Let it boil until 
it thickens, and then place in the outer part of a double 
boiler, 'and cook for two hours. Pour the mush while hot 
over i quart of graham flour, and mix well. When cool, add 
i pint of sponge, ^ cup of malt extract, and i teaspoonful of 
salt. Mix thoroughly, adding more flour if needed, and knead 
ten or fifteen minutes. Make into loaves, having only one 
loaf in a pan, and let rise. Bake in a moderate oven. This 
recipe will make two loaves. 

CHESTNUT BREAD. 

Make a sponge as for white bread, using good white flour. 
When perfectly light, add a little salt and enough of chestnut 
flour to knead well. After kneading it thoroughly, form into 
loaves, put into well-oiled tins, and let it rise until twice its 
first size, and bake in a moderate oven for one hour. 



174 'GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

RAISED BISCUITS (LIGHT). 

Take I quart of sifted flour, i pint of warm nut milk, i cake 
of yeast, I teaspoonful of salt. Set at nine o'clock at night. 
In the morning push it down with a spoon. When light 
again, pull for ten minutes, using as little flour as possible. 
Make it into small biscuits ; place on an oiled pan a little 
distance apart. When very light, bake fifteen or twenty 
minutes. 

PARKER-HOUSE BISCUIT. 

Take I quart of sifted flour, I pint of warm nut milk, 
] tablespoonful of white sugar, i teaspoonful of salt, nutcoa 
one half the size of an egg, and ^ cake of yeast. Sift the 
flour in the bread pan, add the sugar, and peanut oil which 
has been beaten together to a cream ; then add the warm nut 
milk and the yeast dissolved in the milk. Add salt. Do 
not stir, but let rise until evening, then mix all together, 
and knead for twenty or twenty-five minutes. Let rise over- 
night. In the morning form into biscuits, and when per- 
fectly light, bake fifteen or twenty minutes. 

RAISED BISCUIT. 

Take 1 of a compressed yeast-cake, and dissolve in i pint 
of warm (but not hot) water. Add a pinch of salt, and 
white flour enough to make a stiff batter. Put in a warm 
place to rise. When light, add more flour to make a stiff 
dough, and a little sugar if desired, and let rise again. When 
light the second time, work in i cup of peanut oil. Make 
into biscuits of desired size, and let rise until very light ; then 
bake in a moderate oven. Seedless raisins may be added 
if desired. 



YEAST BREADS. I 75 

BREAKFAST BUNS, 

Take 3 cups of nut milk, \ cup of sugar, I teaspoonful of 
salt, i cake of yeast, and flour sufficient to make a stiff bat- 
ter. Let it rise overnight. In the morning take .| cup of 
almond or peanut meal, or \ cup of peanut oil ; mix thor- 
oughly with the batter, pulling it for ten minutes. Beat 
2 eggs, the whites and yolks separately. Add them to the 
batter. Finish like preceding recipe. 

STEAMED BUNS. 

Make the buns the same as other buns for baking, but 
steam them in the steam-cooker for two hours. The long 
cooking kills the yeast germ, and makes them easier of diges- 
tion. They should be put in an oven and browned after 
being taken from the steamer. They are most excellent if 
the sponge is set with thin raw peanut cream ; and when 
made into buns, knead in some whole nuts, such as hickory- 
nuts, pecans, walnuts, butternuts, or any kind of fruit desired, 
as raisins or currants. 

RAISED POTATO ROLLS. 

Take i pint of mashed potatoes, i pint of nut cream, 
i compressed yeast-cake (i ounce), i teaspoonful of salt, and 
flour enough to make a moderately stiff batter. Mix the pota- 
toes, cream, yeast, and salt, and then add the flour. Cover 
the bread pan, and put in a warm place to rise. If too hot, 
the sponge will scald ; therefore the pan should never be put 
where the hand can not be held with comfort. When the 
sponge is light, add more flour to make it stiff enough to 
knead without sticking to the hands and board. Knead for 
ten or fifteen minutes, then roll it out about half an inch 
thick, and cut with a biscuit cutter. Lay two together, and 



1/ GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

put them in an oiled baking pan, and let them rise to twice 
their height. Then brush the tops with peanut oil, and bake 
in a moderate oven about twenty minutes. 

Sweet potatoes mashed may be substituted for the Irish 
potatoes if desired. 

VERY FINE BUNS. 

Take 4 cups of white flour, i cup of sugar, i cup of nut 
cream made from almond butter or cocoanut cream, 2 eggs, 
| cake of compressed yeast, and \ pound of seedless raisins. 
Make a batter of the milk, yeast, and enough of the flour to 
make it quite thick. Set it in a warm place, and when 
perfectly light, add the salt, sugar, and the eggs, which 
should be well beaten. Flour the raisins before adding, and 
knead in the flour. More flour may have to be added, unless 
the Minnesota spring-wheat flour is used. Knead well, and 
form into small buns. Set in a warm place to rise. When 
very light, brush the top with a little nut milk to give it a 
glossy appearance, or sprinkle sugar over the top ; and bake 
in a moderate oven. 

RAISED CORN-MEAL CAKE. 

Take 2 cupfuls of corn-meal; 2 cupfuls of flour, \ cake of 
dry yeast or i gill of liquid yeast, i tablespoonful of flour, i 
teaspoonful of salt, and warm water enough to make a thick 
batter. Rise overnight, and bake in shallow pans. 

SHORTCAKES. 

To i pint of warm -water, add from * to i cake of com- 
pressed yeast or its equivalent in some other kind. Use 
sifted flour sufficient to make a stiff sponge. It will rise in 
three or four hours if kept at a temperature of eighty-five 
degrees. When it is well risen, add i tablespoonful of nut 



YEAST BREADS. I 77 

butter, a little sugar, and enough more flour to make a dough 
as soft as can be conveniently handled and rolled. It should 
be rolled in layers not more than one half an inch thick, two of 
which may be baked on the same tin, if a trifle of fat of some 
kind be applied to the top of the lower one to prevent their 
sticking together. Let them rise until very light, and bake 
until well done. If the top crust seems rather hard, moisten 
it with a wet cloth in milk or a thin emulsion of nut butter. 
Turn the upper one over on to a plate, and spread it with the 
prepared fruit, which may be berries of any kind, sweetened 
to suit the taste. Put the other crust on top, covering it 
with a layer of the fruit. It may be served hot or cold. If 
plenty of fruit be used, there will be no need of cream or any 
other dressing. 

Shortcakes may be prepared the year round by using 
canned fruit or stewed dried fruit. If this be in large form 
like plums, peaches, etc., it is better to put it through a 
colander before using. It will many times be found advan- 
tageous to combine acid fruit with one naturally sweet, thus 
saving the use of dyspepsia-producing cane-sugar. 

APPLE SHORTCAKE. 

Take i cup of some good white bread sponge, add the 
yolk of i egg and \ cup of thick raw peanut cream. Mix 
well together, and add enough flour to roll out well. Roll 
out a little less than one half an inch thick, and place on an 
oiled tin. Put on the top some tart apples which have been 
pared, cored, and cut into eighths. Set in a warm place, 
and let it rise. When light, cook in the steam-cooker for 
one hour ; then remove, sprinkle with sugar, or cover with 
a meringue made of the white of i egg, i tablespoonful of 
sugar, and beaten to a stiff froth. Put it on roughly, so it

\vill be in little piles and bare places where the apple will 
show through. Place in the oven, and brown slightly. Serve 
with a cream made from cocoanut. 

RAISED CANNELONS. 

Take I cup of bread sponge, and add \ cup of thick raw 
nut cream and i egg. Work well together, and add flour to 
roll out well until about one fourth of an inch thick ; then cut 




RAISKD CANNELON. 

into strips nearly an inch wide. Select a small, round stick 
the size of a small broom handle, wash until clean, dry, and 
wrap it in an oiled paper. Then take the strips of dough and 
wind them around the stick, twisting as you wind them, 
taking pains to have them come close together and uniform 
in size. Make the cannelons from five to seven inches long, 



YEAST BREADS. 179 

leaving enough of the stick exposed so it can be easily pulled 
out when the cannelon is cooked. When all is ready, oil the 
outside, and place them on an oiled tin or tins far enough 
apart so they will not touch ; cover with a clean napkin, and 
let them rise until real light. Then place in a steam-cooker, 
having the water in the cooker cool when the dough is put 
in, so they will cook slowly at first, and give them a chance 
to rise. Steam for one hour or longer if desired. Then 
remove from the steamer, and put in the oven until of a 
nice yellow brown ; remove from the oven, and take out the 
stick while the cannelon is still warm. When cold, wrap the 
cannelons in a bread-cloth, and put in the bread-box or stone 
jar. They should stand twenty-four hours before serving. 
When ready to serve, fill the holes with a cream made from 2 
cups of thin cocoanut cream, the whites of 2 eggs, i cup 
sugar, a pinch of salt, and 2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch. 
Heat the cocoanut milk in a double boiler, stirring it quite 
often to keep it from separating. When hot, add salt, sugar, 
and the corn-starch dissolved in a little thin cream. Let it 
cook for ten minutes, stirring quite often ; then add the eggs, 
which should be beaten well ; stir in well, and let it cook for 
a minute. Remove from the stove. When about cool, or 
before it stiffens, fill the cannelons. Let them get cold, and 
they are ready to serve. 

The cannelons may be filled with jelly or any cream 
desired. 

OYSTER SOUP AND DUMPLINGS. 

Take I pint of raw peanut milk, and cook in a double 
boiler for two hours, stirring occasionally to keep it from 
being lumpy or from separating. At the same time the soup 
is put on, prepare some vegetable oysters by scraping, and 
cutting in diagonal, crosswise slices in such a way that the 



I SO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

slices will be larger and more the shape of an oyster. Place 
them in one side of a granite basin, and put the smaller parts 
of the oysters and the little ones on the other side of the 
dish. Put into a steam-cooker, and cook for one hour. 
When done, drop the large slices into the soup, and the little 
ones and small ends should be sifted through a wire sieve or 
a colander and then added to the soup. Add salt, and more 
water if it is too thick. 

Have ready some raised dumplings. If the sponge is set 
early in the morning, they will be ready to put in the steam- 
cooker about half past ten. Take I cup of any good white 
bread sponge, add i cup of quite thick raw peanut cream, 
and i egg (the egg may be omitted). Work all together, and 
add flour to form into very small biscuits. Place them far 
apart on an oiled tin. Put them in a warm place to rise. 
When more than twice their original size, put in the steam- 
cooker and cook for one and one-half or two hours. Cooking 
does not hurt them. When the soup is ready, put the dump- 
lings into the soup, and let them stew together for ten or 
twenty minutes. The soup should not be too thick. 

This is very nice.

SANDWICHES. 



NUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES. 

OPREAD thin slices of bread, with nut butter. Chop some 
O dates, figs, or seedless raisins into a fine mass, and spread 
upon the buttered bread, placing upon this, buttered side 
down, another slice of bread. Crackers, wafers, or other 
kinds of bread may be substituted. The sandwich would be 
more dainty if the fruit were steamed. 

DATE OR FIG SANDWICHES. 

Steam fruit fifteen minutes after scalding with boiling 
water. Grind into a pulp, or else place them, as they are, 
upon slices of bread generously spread with nut butter. 
These, when laid closely in a baking dish, moistened with 
boiling water, and baked, make an excellent pudding, which 
should be served with cream, grape wine, or a sauce made of 
lemons or oranges. 

ROLLED NUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES. 

Cut lengthwise slices from a loaf of good, fresh bread. 
Spread each slice with peanut butter, or any other kind 
desired ; sprinkle on a little salt, and squeeze upon the slices 
a little lemon-juice. Celery salt may also be added. On 
top of these arrange some very crisp lettuce leaves, allowing 
the curly edges to extend beyond the edges of the bread. 

[183] 



1 34 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



Cut a piece of paper the size of the slice, or slightly larger, 
place the bread upon it, and by the aid of the paper roll the 
slice up, taking care not to roll in the paper, too. After hav- 
ing rolled the bread, encircle it with the paper, and tie it, 
allowing it to stand for a time, until it becomes pressed into 
shape, when the paper may be removed, and the sandwich 
fastened with two wooden toothpicks. Serve upon a plate 
or platter garnished with lettuce leaves. 




ROLLED SANDWICHES. 



ROLLED CABBAGE SANDWICHES. 

Cut bread as directed in previous recipe, and spread with 
nut butter, sprinkling with salt. Take a good, firm head of 
cabbage which is white and tender, shave it off into thin 
slices, and put upon the bread, allowing ends of cabbage to 



SANDWICHES. 185 

project beyond the edges of the bread. Prepare for serving 
in the same manner as in the foregoing recipe, fastening with 
toothpicks. 

ROLLED NUTMEATO SANDWICHES. 

In making these sandwiches, be careful not to have the 
bread too long, or the slices too thick, or the roll may be too 
large. Rolled sandwiches should not be too large to be 
readily eaten by biting through from the end. Cut the nut- 
meato very thin, and place it on top of the bread, already 
spread sparingly with nut butter and sprinkled with salt. 
Carefully roll, and fasten by means of toothpicks. 

SWEET NUT SANDWICHES. 

Take good figs, thoroughly wash, and grind through the 
nut mill, adjusting quite closely. Add enough hot water to 
the ground figs to make them spread easily. Then to i cup 
of this mixture, add i tablespoonful of nut butter made from 
walnuts, hickory-nuts, or pecans. Mix well, and spread upon 
thin slices of brown bread cut into squares. See index for 
Brown Bread. 

NUTMEATO AND EGG SANDWICHES. 

Take i cup of grated nutmeato, 2 hard-boiled eggs, salt, 
and celery salt to suit the taste. Sift the eggs through a fine 
wire sieve, add the grated nutmeato, and rub smooth with 
the back of a spoon. Add salt and celery salt. If too dry, 
moisten with a small quantity of nut milk. Cut the brown 
bread into quite thin slices, and with a cooky-cutter just large 
enough to take in all the slices excepting the crust, cut them 
into round pieces, and spread with the mixture. The slices 
should afterward be put together, two and two, in order to 
complete the sandwiches. 



1 86 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

NUTORA SANDWICHES. 

Cut the bread as directed in the previous recipe, and 
spread with nutora. Silt eelery salt on top. A little lemon- 
juice may be added; but this makes the sandwich more diffi- 
cult to digest. A very thin slice of nutmeato may also be 
put between the slices of bread. 

NUTMEATO SANDWICHES. 

Take suitable pieces of moist bread, or buns cut into thin 
slices, and spread with nut butter diluted with water suffi- 
ciently to spread readily. Sprinkle with salt, and place upon 
the whole a very thin slice of nutmeato. Season well with 
celery salt. Place on the slices some tender pieces of lettuce, 
arranging so that the curly edges of lettuce will extend beyond 
the bread. Butter another slice of bread, and put on top. 
With each sandwich serve a quarter of a lemon. Cut lemons 
into quarters by cutting from stern to blow end. Then, with 
the thumb at one end and the forefinger at the other, squeeze 
the juice out upon the nutmeato after lifting off the top slice 
of bread, just before eating. If preferred, the juice may be 
put upon the nutmeato before serving the sandwiches. 

EGG SANDWICHES. 

Chop together two hard-boiled eggs, i teaspoonful parsley, 
a sprinkle of celery salt, i teaspoonful of fresh almond meal, 
i teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and i teaspoonful of crisp cel- 
ery. Spread on slices of bread, cut any shape desired, and 
serve. If the eggs are sifted through a sieve, instead of 
chopping, the mixture is much easier to spread. 



SANDWICHES. 187 

BUTTERNUT SANDWICHES. 

Spread slices of bread with salad dressing as given below, 
sprinkle with chopped butternuts, place two slices together, 
and cut any shape desired. 

DRESSING.- - Boil together i cup of diluted lemon-juice, 
i teaspoonful sugar, some salt, .\ cup nut cream. Beat sepa- 
rately the white and yolk of i egg; after which mix together 
and pour the boiling mixture over them, whipping them all 
the while. Heat in a double boiler, stirring until it changes 
to a creamy consistency. 

GREEN SANDWICHES. 

Chop parsley very fine, and stir it into the dressing given 
in preceding recipe. Spread upon the slices of bread, and 
lay between each sandwich a crisp lettuce leaf. 

HOT APPLE SANDWICHES. 

Take i cup good apple sauce, salt it slightly, sweeten to 
taste, and add a teaspoonful of raw nut meal which has pre- 
viously been slightly roasted in an oven. Spread upon thin 
slices of graham bread, put the slices together, two and two, 
and serve hot. Other breads may be substituted for the 
graham. 

Experiment on other combinations of nuts, fruits, and 
grains used as fillings for sandwiches. The result may be 
something far surpassing any printed recipes. 



CRACKERS. 



ORACKERS can never be very successfully made in the 
\-J private family, as it requires machinery to knead them 
hard enough, and also to roll them out ; but if one can not 
afford to buy crackers, very good ones can be made by 
following out the recipes here given. 

In making crackers, knead in all the flour possible, and 
knead a long time. A man has better success than a woman, 
in making crackers, as strength is required to knead thoroughly 
and roll out the dough thin. Any shortening desired can be 
used. To make a good white cracker, the almond, pine-nut, 
or some of the cream of nuts, must be used. Raw peanut 
cream or cocoanut cream makes a very excellent cracker. 
Crackers should be thoroughly baked until they are dry all 
through. Allow them to cool before using. 

WHITE CRACKERS. 

Take i pound of white flour (4 cups), ^ cup of almond 
butter, and | of a cup of water. Dissolve almond butter by 
adding a little of the water at a time, and working well until 
all of the water is used. Add a little salt, and all the flour 
that can be kneaded in, about 4 cups, although much 
depends upon the grade of flour used. Roll out until it is 
about an eighth of an inch thick, and then cut into squares, 
rounds, or diamonds, as desired ; bake in a moderate oven 
until thoroughly done through, and slightly browned on top. 

Any nut butter may be used instead of the almond butter. 
These crackers are excellent for soups. 
[188] 



CRACKERS. I Si .) 



WHITE CRACKERS NO. 2. 

Take i pound of white flour (4 cups), i teaspoonful of 
salt, and i cup of raw peanut cream (see index). The cream 
should not be too thick, or the crackers will be too short and 
rich. Knead in all the flour possible, and continue kneading 
for a long time. Roll out to a thickness of about one-eighth 
inch, and cut into any desired shape. 

Other kinds of cream may be substituted for the peanut 
cream,-- as cocoanut cream, hickory cream, chufa cream, or 
pine-nut cream. 

GRAHAM CRACKERS. 

Take i pound (4 cups) graham flour, or, if preferable, 1 1 
cups of graham flour and 2| cups of white flour ; | of a cup 
of water, \ cup sugar, i teaspoonful salt, and \\ cups of nut 
meal. Put together the sugar, salt, nut meal, and water. 
Mix the two kinds of flour well, kneading in all the flour 
possible. Work thoroughly for ten minutes, and roll one 
fifth of an inch thick. Cut into any shape desired, and bake. 

Any nut meal may be used, as almond, peanut, pine-nut, 
or hickory-nut. 

OATMEAL CRACKERS. 

Take i pound of oatmeal (not the rolled oats), i| cups 
of water, \ cup of sugar, i^ cups of nut meal, and i tea- 
spoonful of salt. Mix the water, salt, sugar, and nut meal 
together, and knead in all the oatmeal possible. If desired, 
one-third white flour and two-thirds oatmeal may be used. 
Any nut meal may be utilized, as peanut, almond, pine-nut, 
or Brazil-nut. 



IQO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



OATMEAL CRACKERS NO. 2. 

Take i pound of rolled oats, i cup of white flour, I ] cups 
of cold water, \ cup of sugar, and i\ cups of nut meal. Mix 
the flour, rolled oats, and nut meal together, adding the salt 
and sugar to the water. Knead the water into the Hour, 
working thoroughly, and making the dough very stiff. Finish 
the same as other crackers. 



OATMEAL CRACKERS NO. 3. 

Take 2 cups of rolled oats, i cup of white flour, \ cup of 
raw peanut cream, ^ of a cup of cold water, \ of a cup of 
sugar, and a small quantity of salt. Mix cream, water, sugar, 
and salt together. Mix the flour and rolled oats, and stir 
into the water and cream, kneading in all the flour possible. 
Finish the same as other crackers. 

The cream of other nuts may be substituted for raw pea- 
nut cream, if preferable. 

FRUIT CRACKERS. 

Make a dough as directed for Rolls No. 2 or No. 3 (see in- 
dex). Divide the dough into halves, and roll out each half until 
a little less than a quarter of an inch thick. Spread one half 
of the dough with raisins which have been seeded and ground 
through the mill; then place the corresponding half of the 
dough on top. Press together with a rolling-pin, rolling quite 
hard, and perforate part way through, at frequent intervals, 
with a fork. Cut into squares, or any desired shape, and 
bake in a moderately heated oven until of a light-brown color. 

Ground figs or dates may be used in place of ground 
seeded raisins, if preferred. 



CRACKERS. IQI 

FRUIT CRACKERS NO. 2. 

Make a dough as for white crackers. Cut the dough into 
equal parts, and roll out a little less than a quarter of an 
inch thick. Spread one part with seeded raisins which have 
been ground through the mill, or ground figs or dates, after 
which place the other piece of dough upon the fruit. Press 
together \vith a rolling-pin, and perforate part way through, 
short distances apart, with a fork. Cut into squares, and 
bake in a moderately hot oven. 

CROUTONS. 

Something which requires mastication should always be 
eaten with soup. A very palatable as well as economical 
article is prepared as follows: Cut stale bread into cubes of 
convenient size, place on tins, and toast in the oven until 



light brown. 



CORN BREAD WITH EGGS. 



Chop \ cup of nut butter, either almond or peanut, with 
i quart of corn-meal. Add i teaspoonful of salt, i quart of 
cold nut milk, and the yolks of 4 eggs. Beat all to a smooth 
batter ; then fold in the stiffly beaten whites of 4 eggs, pour 
into an oiled baking pan, and bake in a moderate oven for half 
an hour, or until a knitting-needle run into the thickest part 
can be withdrawn clean. The batter can also be baked in 
gem irons or oiled earthen cups. 

GRANOSE WITH HONEY. 

Take some granose and heat in the oven until nice and 
crisp, then take some honey in a spoon and slowly let it drip 
over the granose, tossing it up at the same time. Serve dry ; 
it has a taste like popcorn balls. 



192 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

Malt extract may be used in this recipe instead of the 
honey, also any kind of fruit juice --cranberry juice being 
especially nice. 

ZWIEOLA AND HOT CREAM. 

Put the ^wieola into individual dishes, and pour over it a 
thin peanut cream with a little sugar and a very little salt 
added. The cream should be hot to make it nice. Serve 
as a breakfast dish. 

RICE CAKES. 

Take i cup of cold cooked rice, ) 2 cup of nut milk, i egg, 
salt to taste. Beat the rice, milk, and yolk of the egg until 
they bubble, then fold in the stiffly-beaten whites, and bake 
immediately in cakes on a soapstone griddle. Serve like any 
griddle-cake. 

The soapstone is the best for those who wish to make 
griddle-cakes without using grease of any kind. 

PANCAKES. 

Take \ cup of corn-meal, i \ cups of white flour, 2 cups 
of nut milk, salt to suit the taste, and 4 eggs. Mix the corn- 
meal and flour, add the salt and water, and beat thoroughly. 
Separate the eggs, bc.it the yolks until thick, beat the whites 
to a stiff froth, and fold into the batter. Drop a spoonful on 
a very hot soapstone, and spread it around with the spoon ; 
when browned on one side, turn. Serve hot with maple 
syrup. Cakes can be baked on a common cake griddle with- 
out grease by rubbing the griddle each time with salt. It 
will give a nice brown coat without the objectionable grease 
and smoke, which is so annoying. 



CRACKERS. 193 

YEAST PANCAKES. 

Set a sponge at night of i pint of water, | cake of com- 
pressed yeast, or } 2 cup of liquid yeast, and white or buck- 
wheat flour enough to make a thick batter. Cover, and put 
it where it will keep warm. In the morning it will be light 
and foamy ; add salt, and if too thick, add warm water 
enough to make it of the right consistency ; beat it in well, 
and set where it will have a temperature of eighty degrees. 
In an hour they will be ready to bake. Bake on a soapstone, 
or they can be baked on an ordinary pancake griddle by rub- 
bing the griddle, after each baking, with salt and then brush- 
in- ;ill the salt to one end. When baked in this way, there 
is no smoke, and the cakes arc not greasy, but they have a 
nice brown coat. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Take cold mashed potatoes left over from the previous 
day, form into small cakes with the hands, roll in nut meal, 
and brown on the soapstone. 

POPOVERS. 

Take 2 cups of nut milk, 2 cups of whole-wheat flour, 
i teaspoonful of salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs. Beat the 
yolks until they are thick ; stir the flour into the milk, and 
then add the beaten yolks of the eggs. Lastly add the whites 
of the eggs, which have been beaten to a stiff froth. Bake 
in hot, oiled gem irons. If these are not at hand, earthen 
cups set in a pan, and put in the oven until hot, will answer ; 
then remove, oil, pour the batter into the cups, but only 
about one third or one half full, then return to a quick oven, 
and bake. \Ylu-n nicely browned, serve with nut butter or 
some nice malt extract.

FRUIT. 



T^RUITS consist chiefly of water, and for this reason are 
L scarcely ever looked upon as nutrients. They contain a 
small amount of nitrogenous elements and agreeable acids, 
which are very useful in keeping the vital machinery in good 
working order. That they contain more nutriment than is 
generally supposed is proved by the fact that the natives of 
some countries live almost wholly upon fruit. The Arab, as 
well as his camel, lives principally upon dates. In some 
countries the inhabitants live almost exclusively upon bana- 
nas. Undoubtedly fruit was the principal article of food 
eaten by Adam and Eve while they remained in the Garden 
of Eden. 

The large amount of water that fruits contain makes them 
an excellent article of food for summer, when the system 
requires more liquid, especially in dry countries where the 
water supply is scarce or impure. The water of fruits is abso- 
lutely pure, having been distilled by heaven's own process, 
and then canned and sealed by a skin that is impervious to 
germs. There is no danger of contamination from drinking 
it, as long as the skin is not punctured in any way. The 
juices of the watermelon, orange, lemon, and lime are among 
the best for drinking, and can be taken at any time, as they 
contain no nutriment excepting a little sugar; but the juice 
only should be taken, as the pulp, or cellulose, of fruit is 
indigestible. 

But some fruits are very valuable as nutrients, and it is 
possible to live entirely upon them; among these are the 
prune, apple, date, fig, banana, and raisin. 



FRUIT. 195 

Another very important element of fruits is their acids, 
which are valuable on account of their influence upon certain 
functions of the body; for example, upon the kidneys, acting 
as a natural diuretic; and also as a natural laxative, though 
not having the same effect as a laxative medicine, for fruit 
only produces a natural condition, and if the system is already 
in a natural condition, it has no effect. Perhaps the most 
important point in the use of fruits is the effect their acids 
have upon germs. It has been proved by repeated experi- 
ments and analysis that germs will not grow in fruit juice ; 
therefore, the juices of fruits are natural disinfectants. 

This does not apply to the juice of the lernon, lime, and 
orange alone, but the acids of all fruits are disinfectants to a 
certain extent, some more than others. The juice of one 
lemon in two glasses of water, if left standing fifteen or 
twenty minutes, will thoroughly disinfect it. Thus fruit can 
be of great assistance to travelers, as the water on cars and 
in waiting-rooms is often so impure that it would be danger- 
ous to partake of it. 

Three different kinds of acids are found in fruits: citric 
acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid. Citric acid is found in 
lemons, limes, grapes, and oranges; and malic acid is found 
in almost all acid fruits, but more abundantly in apples, cher- 
ries, plums, and pears. Tartaric acid is found in considerable 
quantities in the grape, and is present in small quantities in 
other fruits. In canned grapes, it is often found condensed 
in small chunks in the bottom of the can. In pie-plant, 
there is a poisonous acid called oxalic acid ; for this reason 
pie-plant is unsafe to use; people have been made seriously 
ill by eating its leaves for greens. A very small per cent, 
of oxalic acid is also found in the tomato; for this reason 
it is not so good a food as some fruits, although it contains 
such a small amount that it is not usually felt. 



196 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

The acids of fruits are digestible; that is, they change 
when entering the system, so that they do not have the effect 
that common acids do. Another element of fruits is the 
sugar which they contain. Some fruits contain a great deal 
more than others. Figs, dates, and raisins contain the most; 
but grapes, cherries, currants, and apples contain quite a per- 
centage, although the acid hides it from the taste in some of 
the fruits, as is the case in the cherry and currant. Some 
fruits, as the plum, apricot, and peach, contain very little 
sugar. 

The sugar which is found in fruits is the sweetest of all 
sugars, and in its natural state, when eaten with the fruit, 
is easy of digestion, being just what the system requires. 
Honey, which is nothing but the sugar of fruits, because it is 
taken from the blossoms, would be a much better and sweeter 
sugar than cane-sugar, if it were not adulterated. Sometimes 
bee keepers feed their bees upon a cheap grade of molasses, 
poor sugar, etc. ; and sometimes when the blossoms of whole- 
some plants and trees are scarce, bees will gather honey from 
the flowers of weeds, or tobacco plants, and even collect the 
honey dew from oak leaves, which is only a secretion of an 
insect. If the pure honey from flowers could be obtained, it 
would be better than cane-sugar; but even then it would con- 
tain some of the pollen of the flowers and some germs. 

There is another constituent of fruits, \vhich, although 
it does not add to the nutritive value, holds the juices and 
determines the shape of the fruit, and that is the cellulose or 
woody fiber. In some fruits, this is very thin and easily 
broken up, as in the strawberry, but in others, it is quite 
tough, woody, and indigestible, as in the orange. It is better 
to reject the cellulose of such fruits. For sick people and 
those having weak stomachs, fruit juice is best, and can often 
be eaten where the fruit can not. 



FRUIT. 197 

The use of fruit for curing disease is by no means a new 
idea. Pliny, the Roman naturalist, who perished in the erup- 
tion that destroyed Pompeii, mentions the grape-cure in his 
day. At the present time, the grape-cure is used quite exten- 
sively in France, Switzerland, and Germany, and has been 
tried to some extent in California. But curative properties 
are not peculiar to the grape alone, as there are the -straw- 
berry_-cure, the peach-cure, the cherry-cure, and the apple- 
cure. 

The reasons why fruit is so beneficial in cases of disease, 
are as follows : First, because they are disinfectants, clear- 
ing out the germs from the stomach and alimentary canal ; 
second, the}' break up the waste substances so they can be 
eliminated by the kidneys. 

Fruits are of great value in the treatment of fevers, sick 
headache, nervous headache, biliousness, Bright's disease, 
obesity, consumption, and intestinal disorders. Fruits are 
eaten with greater benefit, if eaten alone. If other foods are 
eaten at the same meal, great care should be taken in the 
combination. Fruit and vegetables do not combine well ; 
fruits and eggs do not unless the eggs are raw ; neither do 
very acid fruits combine well with grains, as the acids, if in 
too great a quantity, hinder the digestion of starch. 

Fruits contain an abundance of water, a meager supply of 
albumen, sugar, acid, and cellulose ; but no fats, except in 
the olive, and only a very small amount of starch, except in 
the green fruit. But fats, while nearly absent in fruits, are 
just what nuts can supply. In cold climates especially, the 
fats are very essential for producing heat in the body. The 
system can get along better without starch than fats. Nuts 
and fruits therefore make an ideal diet.

APPLES. 

The apple is the fleshy fruit of a tree belonging to the 
rose family ( Kosucfic). The calyx of the flower becomes 
thick, pulpy, and edible at maturity, enclosing the seed-pod 
with seeds. 

The apple has been cultivated and highly valued as a food 
from very early times. The Greeks and the Romans used 
the apple very extensively. Apples may be eaten raw, 
stewed, or baked. If they are eaten raw, they should be 
ripe and mellow, and care should be taken to masticate 
them thoroughly. 

BANANAS. 

The banana is the fruit of a large, herbaceous plant, 
closely related to the plantain, and cultivated in most tropical 
countries for its fruit, which grows in clusters of more than a 
hundred finger-shaped berries, upon a very large spike, or 
stem. When ripe, the rind encloses a nutritious and seedless 
pulp, which forms the principal article of diet of the natives, 
and is largely exported to cooler climates. 

The United States imported 15,000,000 bunches during 
the year 1897, valued at $20,000,000. 

Bananas are very nutritious, a pound of good, ripe bananas 
being almost equal in nutriment to a pound of beefsteak. 
Bananas contain about five per cent, of albuminous elements, 
and twenty per cent, of carbonaceous. 

The banana can be dried and made into flour ; in this 
form, it has about twenty per cent, of albumen. The ripe 
banana contains only a small percentage of starch, and that 
is very easy of digestion. The unripe banana contains more 
starch, and should be cooked before being eaten. 



FRUIT. 199 

CHERRIES. 

The cherry is the fruit of a small tree or shrub belonging 
to the genus Primus. The fruit is smooth and bloomless, 
enclosing a small, smooth seed. There are many varieties of 
the cherry, both of the wild and the tame. The sour cherry 
contains about nine per cent, of sugar, but this is almost en- 
tirely disguised by the acid which it contains. The sweet 
cherry contains about eleven per cent, of sugar. An eminent 
physician once cured a patient who had chronic diarrhea, by 
a diet of ripe cherries. This treatment was continued for 
several weeks. 

CRANBERRIES. 

The cranberry is the fruit of a small, slender vine growing 
in marshy places. The fruit is round or oblong and of a 
bright red color. The flesh is quite hard and firm, and is 
covered with a thick, waxy skin, which is germ- and water- 
proof. For this reason, they are long keepers ; freezing 
spoils them if they are allowed to thaw, but if they are kept 
frozen until used, they are just as good. The skin is quite 
hard of digestion, and those having weak stomachs, would 
better reject them. The cranberry is quite acid, containing 
two and three-tenths per cent. It is not a very nutritious 
fruit, having a nutritive value of only four and one-tenth 
per cent. 

The juice of the cranberry is excellent in cases of fever, 
diluted with water and used as a drink. It is also good in 
coloring puddings, frostings, soups, etc. 

CURRANTS. 

This fruit is indigenous to America, Europe, and Asia. 
It probably derives its name from Corinth, where it was 
grown extensively. It is a small, round fruit, red, white, and 



2OO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

sometimes black, growing in long clusters, or racemes, on 
low, thornless, scraggly shrubs. The fruit is quite sour, con- 
taining two and two-tenths per cent, of acid ; but it also con- 
tains six and four-tenths per cent, of sugar, so that it is very 
palatable eaten in the raw state without the addition of sugar. 
The juice of the currant makes a very pleasant drink, when 
diluted with water, and one that is very beneficial in cases 
of fever. It is also excellent for making jelly, as it contains 
considerable pectose. or the jelly-producing element of fruit. 

DATES. 

The date is the fruit of the date-palm ; the name is 
derived from dactyl, so named from its shape. Botanically, 
it is called Pliccnix dactylifcra, and it grows plentifully in 
the dry regions of Asia and Africa. The trees have lofty 
trunks with terminal feathery foliage. The fruit is borne at 
the base of the leaves, each tree yielding from one hundred 
to three hundred pounds. 

What rice is to the inhabitants of some portions of Asia, 
dates are to the people of Africa. It forms the chief article 
of food in nearly all Africa north of the equator, as well 
as in Arabia. The Arab not only eats them himself, but 
feeds them to his camel and his horse. The date-palm not 
only furnishes the fruit, but the tree supplies building mate- 
rial and clothing to the native. The sap of the tree is 
very sweet, and is often made into a sugar ; but it is some- 
times unwisely allowed to ferment, and is then called date 
wine. 

The fruit of the date is very palatable and nutritious. In 
its dried state, as it is obtained in the market of this country, 
it contains a total nutritive value of sixty-seven per cent. ; 
of this fifty-eight per cent, is sugar, and nine per cent, is 



FRUIT. 2O I 

albumen. On account of its sweetness, it is good to use with 
acid fruits, and it may also be used with good effect in sweeten- 
ing cakes and puddings instead of sugar. 

FIGS. 

The fig is the fruit of a tree botanically called Ficus Carica. 
The trees are small, with large, green leaves, and pear-shaped 
fruit, which in color varies from a dark purple to a yellowish 
tinge. When ripe, the cultivated fig has a soft, sweet pulp, 
filled with very small seeds, and is much esteemed for food, 
both when it is fresh and when dried or preserved. It has 
been used for food from very ancient times, perhaps from the 
time of Adam, and is frequently mentioned throughout the 
sacred writings. 

It is also used in the preparation of laxatives. In our 
markets, it is sold only in its dried state ; but even when 
dried, it is excellent for puddings and sauces ; it also com- 
bines well with nuts. It contains fifty per cent, of sugar, 
and four per cent, of albumen. 

GRAPES. 

The grape is the fruit of a vine belonging to the genus 
Vitis, of the Vine family Vitace<z. It has long tendrils that 
aid it in climbing trellises ; its leaves are large and glossy 
green. The flowers are very small and fragrant, appearing in 
the spring before the leaves. The fruit is borne in large clus- 
ters, varying in size and color, as well as in the amount of 
nutritive elements which they contain. Some grapes contain 
as high as twenty-two per cent, of sugar, and others very 
much less. The same is also true of the albuminous ele- 
ments. One pound of the Malaga grapes is said to contain 
as much albumen as an egg, and about fifteen per cent, of 



202 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

sugar. From this we see that the grape is nutritious, although 
the greater part of it is water ; this fact, however, makes it 
better for a summer food and more desirable for fever 
patients. 

The grape-cure has been in use for many hundred years, 
and is considered very beneficial in some forms of dyspepsia. 
When a diet of grapes only is used, three or four meals in a 
day are not too many. The raisin, which is a sweet variety 
of dried grape, is very nutritious and useful in preparing 
many foods. They arc excellent if ground and mixed with 
nut butter. 

GOOSEBERRIES. 

The gooseberry is the fruit of a shrub belonging to the 
same genus as the currant. The bush is a thorny shrub, and 
in its wild state yields a prickly berry ; but the fruit of the 
cultivated sort is smooth and luscious. They are generally 
used in their green state, when they contain malic and citric 
acids, and have a nutritive value of five or six per cent. The 
juice when diluted with water makes an excellent drink for 
summer. 

HUCKLEBERRIES. 

The huckleberry is the fruit of a small bush or shrub be- 
longing to the Heath family (Ericacece). They are also called 
whortleberries and blueberries. There are several species, 
the two principal ones in this country being the high-bush and 
the low-bush huckleberry. There is not much difference 
in the fruit of the two kinds. The berry is almost black, some- 
times covered with a light-blue powder. The inside is light 
colored, and contains many small seeds. It is quite mild in 
flavor, and is excellent for those who can not eat acid 
foods. 



FRUIT. 2O3

LEMONS. 

The lemon is the fruit of a tropical or subtropical tree, 
belonging to the Orange family (Aurantiacece). It is oblong 
in shape, with a protruding point at each end. The fruit is 
from two to four inches long, and when ripe is of a bright 
yellow color, slightly tinged with green. It contains no 
nutriment to speak of ; the juice is very acid, and for this 
reason is highly valued for making drinks in hot weather, 
being especially valuable for fever patients. The citric acid 
which the lemon contains acts as a disinfectant in the stom- 
ach, killing the germs, and doing away with stomach washes. 
Very much lemon-juice should not be taken at meal-time, as 
acids, if taken in any considerable quantity, hinder the diges- 
tion of starch, by changing the saliva, which is alkaline, to 
an acid. For this reason lemon pies, puddings, cakes, and all 
other foods where starch is combined with the lemon, are not 
to be recommended. But egg-nog, made of the white of the 
egg and lemon-juice is all right, as the white of the egg con- 
tains only albumen. 

LIMES. 

The lime is the fruit of a tree belonging to the same 
family as the lemon, and very much resembling it excepting 
it is much smaller. In composition it is very much like the 
lemon, and can be used in the same way. The lime has been 
celebrated in all ages for the fragrance of its flowers and the 
excellence of the honey made from them. British sailors are 
furnished a weekly allowance of the extract of lime or lemon 
as a preventive of scurvy. It is also used as a medicine in 
some forms of dyspepsia. 



204 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

MELONS. 

The melon is not really a fruit, but in composition is as 
nearly allied to fruit as to vegetables. 

It belongs to the Gourd family, and consists principally of 
water, having no nutriment except a little sugar. The pulp, 
or fibrous portion, is indigestible, and should be rejected. 
The juice forms a pure and healthful drink, being free from 
disease germs, if the melon is sound ; but it is better to eat it 
at night or between meals, as any considerable quantity taken 
at meal-time would dilute the gastric juice, the same as would 
other liquids. 

ORANGES. 

The orange is the fruit of a tree very closely allied to the 
lemon and lime, but having a much larger and sweeter fruit. 
In nutritive value it is very low, only having six to eight per 
cent, of sugar ; the remainder is water in a very pure form, 
enclosed in a tough pulp which is wholly indigestible and 
should never be swallowed. Physicians tell us that there is 
no harm in drinking an orange before going to bed. 

t 

PINEAPPLES. 

The pineapple is the fruit of a tropical plant indigenous to 
South America. The plant only grows a few inches high, 
and is surmounted by a densely packed flower pike, which 
becomes the fruit. The leaves of the plant are coarse, 
fibrous, and thick, with prickly edges. The fruit consists of 
the consolidation of the raceme of berries with a bunch of 
leaves at the top, which is called the "crown." 

When left on the plant until it is thoroughly ripe, it is very 
soft, juicy, and of a delicious sweet flavor ; but as they are 
obtained in the markets here, they are too green and woody 



FRUIT. 2O5 

to be easily digested, and only the juice should be used. 
Cooking, however, makes them more digestible. The pine- 
apple is low in nutritive value, but it contains a digestive 
element very similar to pepsin, and is therefore an excellent 
medicine in some forms of dyspepsia. It also contains an 
acid which is a disinfectant, and the juice is considered an 
excellent gargle for the throat in diphtheria. 

PEACHES. 

The peach is the fruit of a tree belonging to the Prunus 
family. It opens its blossoms, which are rose-colored, early 
in the spring before the leaves appear. The trees grow from 
eight to twenty feet high, and have lanceolate leaves. The 
fruit grows from one to three inches in diameter, having a 
yellow, white, or reddish skin covered with a thick woolly 
down. The fruit is juicy and highly flavored. It has seven 
per cent, of albumen, four and five-tenths per cent, of sugar, 
nine per cent, of acids, and seven per cent, of salts ; so it 
has not a very high nutritive value. 

PLUMS. 

The plum belongs to the same family as the peach, and 
resembles it in growth and leaves. The fruit is very similar 
in composition, but it has a smooth skin. The plum tree is 
more hardy than the peach, and will grow and produce fruit 
where the peach will not. 

PRUNES. 

The prune is only a sweet variety of the plum, which has 
been dried. When thoroughly cooked, they are very nice, 
and are sometimes eaten for a laxative. 



2O6 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

PEARS. 

The pear is the fruit of a tree called Pyrus coinniunis, and 
belongs to the Rose family (Rosacece]. The fruit is quite 
large and bell-shaped, being the largest at the blow end, and 
tapering toward the stem. When ripe, it is very juicy and 
delicious, but contains considerable cellulose, or woody matter. 
It contains four per cent, of albumen, eight and two-tenths 
per cent, of malic acid, three and three-tenths per cent, of 
pectose, and three per cent, of salts, making a total nutritive 
value of twelve and four-tenths per cent. 

QUINCES. 

The quince is the fruit of a shrub, or small tree, belonging 
to the Rose family (Rosaccce}. The fruit is from two and one- 
half to three inches in diameter; it is quite hard, acid, pleas- 
ant flavored, and fragrant, and is of a yellowish green color. 
It is never eaten in the uncooked state in this country, 
because the summers are not long enough for it to ripen; but 
in Crete, its native home, it ripens, when it is much easier of 
digestion. 

RASPBERRIES. 

The raspberry is the fruit of a trailing bush that very 
closely resembles the blackberry. There are many varieties 
of the raspberry; among them are the red, the black, and the 
white. They are a thimble-shaped berry, containing many 
seeds, which are surrounded by a juicy pulp that is subacid 
and has a very pleasant flavor. The raspberry is used in 
making jellies, jams, wine, vinegar, and brandy, besides being 
used in its uncooked state. The berries are sometimes given 
for an astringent, and are very beneficial. 



FRUIT. 2O7 

STRAWBERRIES. 

The strawberry is the fruit of a low-growing vine belong- 
ing to the Rose family (Rosacea*}. It is the most widely dis- 
tributed of all the fruit-bearing plants, growing in very cold 
as well as in tropical countries. The fruit is the fleshy recep- 
tacle, which becomes very juicy and edible, and is of a bright 
red color. The fruit contains very little cellulose and is there- 
fore easy of digestion. The strawberry contains the nutritive 
elements in the right proportion, and will therefore sustain life 
without other food, if a sufficient amount is eaten. It con- 
tains eighty-seven per cent, of water, and one and one-tenth 
per cent, of albumen, six and three-tenths per cent, of sugar, 
five-tenths per cent, of fats, nine-tenths per cent, of malic 
acid, five-tenths per cent, of pectose, and eight-tenths per 
cent, of salts, or about ten per cent, of total nutriment. This 
fruit is often used as a medicine. The strawberry-cure is 
quite as beneficial as the grape-cure. 

PIE-PLANT. 

Pie-plant is not a fruit, but is sometimes used in the place 
of it in sauce and pie. It contains water, woody matter or 
cellulose, and oxalic acid; and as the latter is very poisonous, 
pie-plant should not be used. 

TOMATOES. 

Although it is usually classed with vegetables, it more 
closely resembles fruit. It contains malic acid and a very 
little oxalic acid, but not enough to be injurious. It also 
contains one and six-tenths per cent, of albumen, two and 
five-tenths per cent, of sugar, three-tenths per cent, of fats ( 
one and eight-tenths per cent, of acid, and six-tenths per cent, 
of salts, having a total nutritive value of six and five-tenths 
per cent. 



FRESH FRUIT. 



IN serving fresh fruit, it should always be that which is per- 
fectly ripe and sound, and should be thoroughly washed 
and wiped dry. Fruit with decayed spots upon it, is diseased, 
and should not be eaten. It has a circulation similar to that 
of the human body; and when one part becomes diseased, 
the germs are transmitted to all parts, and it quickly decays. 
Fruit is especially desirable in the summer, as it has a 
cooling effect, and supplies the extra demand for water; the 
acids in the fruit are disinfectants, and destroy all the germs 
in the stomach and intestinal canal. Indeed, if fresh fruit 
were more generally eaten during the spring months, there 
would be less sickness, and a much less demand for spring 
medicines. 

There is no food that adds more beauty to the table than 
a nicely arranged dish of fresh fruit. Some bright oranges 
heaped upon a fruit dish which has been trimmed with some 
well-washed orange leaves (other kinds of leaves will do), 
make a very pretty dish. Another very artistic, unique, and 
appetizing way to serve oranges is to cut them in halves, pla- 
cing them on a plate with the cut side up, and decorating the 
plate with leaves and orange blossoms. When served in this 
way, they are to be eaten with a spoon, eating only the juice. 
The woody tissue is indigestible, and should never be eaten. 
Cherries also make an inviting dish, if washed and dried 
well, and heaped upon a plate, with a few clean cherry leaves 
around the edge of the plate. 
[208] 



FRESH FRUIT. 2Og 

STRAWBERRIES. 

These may be served in the following manner : Select 
good, ripe strawberries that are a bright red color; wash well, 
but very carefully, so as not to mash the berries. Remove 
the hulls, and if the berries are the least sandy, wash again. 
Put into individual dishes, and pour over them a nut cream 
made from the cocoanut (see index for cocoanut cream), and 
serve without sugar, leaving each individual to sweeten to 
taste. 

FRESH RASPBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, AND 
HUCKLEBERRIES. 

These may be served with the cocoanut cream the same 
as the strawberries. Any kind of nuts may be used, however, 
for the cream; such as the hickory-nut, peanut, or almond. 
They may be served, too, without any dressing. 

CURRANTS. 

The white currant is the sweeter, but does not make as 
pretty a dish as the red currant. This fruit is quite acid, and 
makes a more palatable sauce, if part of them are mashed 
and sweetened for an hour before serving. Take | of a cup 
of sugar to i quart of currants which have been picked from 
the stems and have been well washed. Mash with a wooden 
potato masher or with the bottom of a tumbler. Let the 
fruit stand, to allow the sugar to dissolve and permeate the 
fruit. Currants may also be served without mashing and 
without sugar. 

PLUMS. 

Select good, ripe plums that are large in size and capable 
of being easily peeled. The peach plum, egg plum, and lum- 
bard are good varieties to choose. With a very sharp, thin-

some varieties quite easily, by cutting the plum into halves. 
If they can be removed, do so; if not, serve whole, sprinkling 
with a very little sugar. 

PEACHES. 

Peaches make a very inviting dish, if, after the fruit has 
been wiped with a damp cloth, it is stacked upon a fruit 
plate, or served with other fresh fruits, as pears, plums, and 
apples. As a sauce, they are good when peeled, sliced, and 
served with nut cream (see index for cocoanut cream). 

PEARS. 

Fresh, ripe pears are an ideal table fruit. They make an 
artistic dish alone, or when served on a fruit plate with mixed 
fruits. Being so rich, juicy, and easily prepared, they are 
usually served in this way. But they are also very good if 
peeled, cored, and sliced, and served in individual sauce 
dishes, without sugar ; or, if desired, they may be served 
with sugar and nut cream (see index for cocoanut cream). 

GRAPES. 

Grapes not only make a very inviting dish alone, and also 
when combined with other fruits, but they are so plentiful 
and cheap in almost all parts of the country, that they can 
be freely used every day during their season. A very artistic 
effect can be made in serving grapes by placing on the same 
dish the three different colors --the purple, the white, and 

the wine. 

APPLES. 

Nothing is more cheering on a cold wintry day than a dish 
of bright red apples. The apple and the banana are the two 
fruits most commonly used on the tables, as they can be

obtained for so many months in the year, in every part of the 
country. Well-matured, mellow, sweet apples make a very 
good sauce when served raw, if peeled, cored, sliced, and 
covered with cocoanut cream (see index). 

BANANAS AND ORANGES. 

Select good, ripe bananas. Peel and slice thin. 
Squeeze over them the juice of an orange, and sprinkle with 
powdered sugar. This dish is usually served cold, but for 
weak persons it is best not to have foods very cold ; as, 
before digestion can take place, they must be warmed by the 
stomach, which of course diminishes the vitality, and is a tax 
upon the system. 

PINEAPPLES. 

The pineapple is a delicious fruit, and is of late years 
becoming so abundant and cheap that it is coming into more 
general use. 

It is generally peeled, sliced, and sugared before it is sent 
to the table ; but by this method the beauty of the fruit as 
well as much of its flavor and juices are lost. In England, 
where pineapples are always the greatest luxuries, they are 
cut in horizontal slices, with a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, 
the slices being kept together, and the crown left on the fruit, 
which is placed in the center of a dish of assorted fruit as the 
chief ornament of the dessert. The pineapple can then be 
served on individual dishes, accompanied with a dish of pow- 
dered sugar. 

A very pretty and unique way of serving pineapples is to 
cut a slice from the top, removing the crown, and then with 
a silver spoon scrape out all the pulp possible, removing the 
core with a sharp knife. Sweeten the pulp to suit the taste, 
and pour back into the pineapple. The juice of another 



212 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

pineapple may also be put in if one will not be sufficient. 
Then place on the crown, and put the filled pineapple on a 
low fruit dish or plate, placing plums or small, curled yellow 
bananas around it. 

In serving, lift off the crown, and dish into individual 
sauce-dishes. 

Select a good, ripe pineapple. With a very sharp knife, 
remove the skin and eyes ; and slice very thin and in small 
shavings. Then take some very sweet Florida oranges, 
remove the outer peeling, separate into the natural divisions, 
and with a very sharp knife cut away the membranous skin 
surrounding the pulp. Place in a fruit dish in alternate layers 
with the sliced pineapples, dusting each layer with pulverized 
sugar. Then pour over all a rich cocoanut cream (see 
index); or, if desired, the freshly grated cocoanut may be 
used, putting it on in layers, as you do the pineapple and 
orange. 



TO CAN FRUIT. 



FRUIT canning is a very simple process, but if it is perfectly 
successful, certain principles must be followed : - 

1. All germs must be killed and excluded. 

2. Only good, sound fruit should be used. 

3. Keep in as natural condition as possible. 

Germs are the cause of decomposition, Then, in order 
that fruit may keep, all the germs which have settled upon it 
from the surrounding air and from the touch of fingers, must 
be destroyed. Fruit does not harbor as many germs as most 
foods ; this is on account of the acids which they contain. 
But in handling the fruit after the skin is removed, germs from 
the air will adhere and prevent its keeping, unless they are 
destroyed. 

Another reason why fruit sometimes spoils, is because the 
germs that are in the empty cans are not all killed. This is 
the only reason why new cans will keep fruit better than old 
ones. When using old cans, they should be thoroughly 
sterilized. As soon as the fruit is taken out, the cans should 
be thoroughly washed, scalded in boiling water, then drained, 
by inverting and resting one edge on something to allow the 
steam to escape, and stored away without the covers on. 
The covers should be well cleansed so that all fruit be removed 
from every crease, and put away in a box in a dry place ; the 
rubbers should be tied with a string and kept where it is 
warm, as freezing injures the rubbers. The practise of put- 
ting the rubber in the can and screwing on the cover is not 

[213] 



2 I 4 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

to be recommended, as the air confined in the can decom- 
poses. When cans are well taken care of, as previously 
described, they need only thorough washing and rinsing when 
they are needed for canning. 

Only the best fruit is good enough to can. Partially 
decayed fruit is expensive at any price, as it is almost sure to 
spoil. Fruit spoils in different ways. Sometimes it ferments, 
becoming foamy, and begins to ooze out. This can be readily 
told by the looks; but again it will look all right, when the 
fruit has changed to vinegar; then sometimes it will have a 
musty taste. In any of these cases, it is unfit to use. Many 
whose sense and taste are not very acute do not detect the 
difference between good and spoiled fruit, and then can not 
understand why their stomachs give them so much trouble. 

In canning fruit, it is usually best to put the fruit in be- 
fore it is cooked. This is especially true of small fruits ; as, 
strawberries, plums, etc. Indeed, all fruit looks a great deal 
better canned in this way. 

Fill the cans full, and shake down as much as possible, 
then fill with a very thin syrup, put on the covers, but 
not the rubbers, and cook in a boiler with enough water 
nearly to cover the cans. Different fruits require differ- 
ent lengths of time for cooking. Strawberries only require 
twenty minutes after the water begins to boil. Pears, if they 
are hard, take two hours. When done, fill up with syrup, 
put on the rubber, and screw down tight. Invert to see if it 
is air-tight, and then set, with the cover down, on the table 
to cool. When cold, turn over, and tighten the covers if 
possible ; and if it is fruit which fades, as strawberries, the 
can should be wrapped with brown paper, and then set 
in a dark, cool place. All fruit is better to be kept in a 
cool place. 



TO CAN FRUIT. 2 I 5 

STRAWBERRIES. 

\ 

The first thing of importance in canning strawberries is 
to select good, sound fruit. Those that have been water- 
soaked by a heavy rain are not good for canning, as they 
will almost always spoil. The dark red strawberry holds its 
color better than the light red one, and is therefore preferable 
for canning. 

Wash the berries by putting them in a wire basket, and 
dipping them into a large pail partly filled with water, lifting 
up and down to rinse off all the sand and dust; then remove 
the hulls, being very careful not to mash the berries. If they 
are still sandy or dirty, they can be rinsed again; but the less, 
the better, after the hulls are removed. 

Fill the cans, and with one hand over the mouth of the 
jar, shake down as much as possible without jamming the 
fruit; then fill the cans with a syrup which is made by boiling 
i cup of sugar in 6 cups of water. Screw on the covers, 
leaving the rubbers off. Cook in a steam-cooker; or boil in 
a wash-boiler, by putting a rack made of lath in the bottom 
of the boiler so the cans will not come too close to the fire. 
Three or four thicknesses of cloth will also prevent the cans 
from breaking. Fill the boiler with cold water until the cans 
are about two thirds covered with it, cover tightly, and after 
the water comes to a boiling-point, let the berries boil twenty 
minutes. Then remove the boiler from the stove, and let 
cool for twenty or thirty minutes. Remove from the cooker 
or boiler, one can at a time. As soon as one is taken out, 
remove cover, fill can with boiling-hot syrup, put on the rub- 
ber, screw the cover down as tightly as possible, and invert 
the can. If the can is not air-tight, the juice will ooze out, 
or there will be a sizzling sound. When this occurs, try 
again, endeavoring to screw down the cover more tightly. If 



2l6 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

this does not help it, the probable cause is in the cover. 
Very often the edges are turned up and made uneven; for the 
.usual way of opening fruit cans is by running a thin-bladed 
knife around the can, between the rubber and the glass. This 
often results in the edge of the cover being bent upward; and 
when the cover is used the next fruit season, it should be 
hammered down. This may be done on the can, hitting the 
edge of the cover with a hammer. There is not much danger 
of breaking the cans, as when filled with fruit, they do not 
easily break. 

When all are filled and tightened, set the cans on their 
covers until cold; then turn over, wrap in brown paper, and 
set away in a cool, dark place. The brown paper helps to 
keep them dark. Light fades all fruit to some extent, and 
strawberries especially are made lighter in color by the light. 

If these directions are strictly followed, the fruit will not 
only keep well, but will be of a natural color and perfectly 
whole, making an attractive and inviting dish for the table. 

RASPBERRIES. 

The raspberry is a seedy fruit, and it is therefore neces- 
sary to select as large, pulpy ones as possible. Look over 
carefully. Wash by putting in a wire basket, and dipping in 
a pail of water. Then put into the cans, shaking down some, 
but being careful not to bruise the berries. Fill with a 
syrup made by boiling i cup of sugar in 7 cups of water. 
Screw on the cover tightly, leaving off the rubber. Cook in 
a steam-cooker, or common boiler, arranging the same as for 
canning strawberries, and cooking about the same length of 
time. Finish the same as strawberries, excepting the wrap- 
ping with brown paper, which may be left off if desired, as 
raspberries will not fade very much, if kept in a dark place. 



TO CAN FRUIT. 217 

CHERRIES. 

Select good, plump fruit, and that which is not wormy. 
Wash well. Cherries can be pitted with a cherry-pitter, but 
they look much nicer if pitted by hand, as the machine lacer- 
ates them somewhat. To pit them by hand, use a common 
steel fork, inserting the tines into the cherry near the stem 
end, holding the fruit with the left hand, and pulling out the 
seed. If this be done carefully, the cherry will be almost as 
it was before, when whole. Some prefer to leave the pits in, 
but it gives them a peculiar " pitty " taste. There are sea- 
sons, too, when the cherries are very wormy, and it is diffi- 
cult to distinguish between the good and the bad ones, unless 
the pit is removed. Put the fruit in the cans, and finish 
like strawberries, with the exception of cooking the cherries 
one hour. Use the same amount of sugar. 

HUCKLEBERRIES. 

Select good, large, fresh berries. Look them over care- 
fully, rejecting all soft and withered ones. Wash well, and 
place in the cans, shaking down as much as possible. Fill 
the cans with a syrup made of i cup of sugar to 12 cups of 
water. Finish the same as strawberries, with the exception 
of cooking the huckleberries for half an hour after they begin 
to boil. When canned in this way, the berries remain whole, 
and look almost like fresh huckleberries. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

The blackberry, like the raspberry, is very seedy. It is 
therefore important that large, pulpy, ripe fruit be selected. 
Can the same as raspberries. 



2l8 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

PEACHES. 

The best peaches for canning, in most sections of the 
country, are the Early Crawford, Barnard, Golden Drop, Hill's 
Chile, and Late Crawford. It is always best to select the larg- 
est fruit; for although there are not so many peaches in a 
bushel, there are also not so many pits, and hence a bushel 
of large fruit will make more quarts than a bushel of small 
ones; and they are usually more juicy and better flavored. 

To prepare for canning, wipe each peach with a dry 
cloth, rubbing off the fuzz as thoroughly as possible. Cut 
into halves, running the knife through the stem and blow end 
of the fruit. Remove the pit, pare each half, and drop into 
a clean can in such a way that the pit side will be downward, 
or toward the center. Drop them all in the same way, so 
that they will pack together closely. Crowd in all you pos- 
sibly can; and as soon as one can is filled, set it in the refrig- 
erator, or some other cool place, while you are peeling the 
rest. This will keep them from turning dark. When enough 
cans have been prepared to fill the boiler, fill up the cans 
with a syrup made by boiling i cup of sugar in 10 cups of 
water. However, if the peaches are very sweet, more water 
may be added. Screw down the covers tightly, leaving off 
the rubbers, and cook for one hour after the water boils. 
Remove, and finish the same as strawberries. Peaches do 
not need to be wrapped with paper. If different kinds are 
put up, it is always best to label them. 

PEARS. 

The Bartlett, Flemish Beauty, and Rostiezer are con- 
sidered by many the best summer pears for canning. They 
should be ripe, but not soft. Wash well, peel, and cut in 
halves lengthwise, and with a sharp knife take out the 



TO CAN FRUIT. 2IQ 

core and blow end. Then, unless they are too large to 
get in, put them in the can in halves, arranging them so that 
the inside is downward or toward the center. Pack closely, 
and fill the can with a syrup made by boiling i cup of 
sugar in 14 cups of water. Cook in a steam-cooker for 
two hours; then remove, fill up with boiling syrup, put on 
the rubber, screw down the cover tightly, and invert can 
to see if it is air-tight. If it is, place on the table, stand- 
ing the can on the cover until it is cold. Then turn right 
side up, tighten the cover, if possible, and set away in a 
cool room. 

PLUMS. 

The best plums for canning, in most sections of the 
country, are the Damask, Green Gage, Lombard Peach 
plum, and Golden Drop. The Golden Drop plums are no 
more acid, when canned, than a peach; but the other kinds 
are quite acid. 

Wash well, pack in the cans whole, and fill with syrup 
made by boiling I cup of sugar to 5 cups of water (the 
Golden Drop requires less sugar). Cook the same as straw- 
berries, letting them cook, however, from forty minutes to 
one hour. If real ripe, they will become well cooked in 
forty minutes. 

GRAPES. 

The Concord is a very good grape for canning; but there 
are others equally as good among the purple varieties. The 
white, or green grapes are not usually so good and rich in 
flavor as the purple grapes. 

Wash well, pick from the stem, and pinch off the skins, 
putting the pulps in one dish and the skins in another. Cook 
the pulps just enough to free the seed, and then sift through 



22O GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

a colander. Boil the skins in water until tender, and add to 
the pulps. Cook all together, and sweeten to taste. Pour 
into well-washed cans, and seal. The sugar may be omitted, 
the fruit being sweetened when the cans are opened for use, 
adding the sugar several hours before using, so it will become 
dissolved in the fruit. 

APPLES. 

The Snow apple is the best for canning ; but all varieties 
can be used. If the Snow apple is used, wash well and peel, 
cooking the peelings in a little water. Steam or boil the 
apples (which should be quartered and cored before cooking) 
until perfectly tender, but not mushy. Squeeze the juice 
from the skins, and add to the apples. Add i cup of sugar 
to each two-quart can of apples, and can while hot. The 
juice from the skins is red, and gives the canned fruit a pink 
color. The small Siberian crab-apples when cooked and sifted 
through a colander, are good canned, or dried on plates. 

SWEET APPLES AND QUINCES. 

The Talman sweet is the best sweet apple for cook- 
ing and canning. Wash, pare, and core the fruit ; prepare 
in the same manner half as many quinces. Place alternate 
layers of apples and quinces in the cans, continuing in this 
manner until the cans are full, having in them about twice as 
many apples as quinces. Fill the cans with syrup made by 
boiling i cup of sugar in about 10 cups of water ; and finish 
the same as strawberries, excepting the time of cooking, 
which should, in this case, be about one and one-half hours, 
or until tender. If desired, the sweet apples may be canned 
alone. They make an excellent sauce for spring, when sweet 
apples are scarce ; or they may be kept for years, and used 
in a year when apples are scarce. 



TO CAN FRUIT. 221 

PUMPKIN. 

Select a good, ripe pumpkin, one which is fine grained. 
Peel, cut out all the stringy portion on the inside, and cut 
into small pieces. Cook in a kettle, adding a very little 
water ; allow it to cook for several hours, and stir occasion- 
ally, to keep from burning. When quite dry, and of a dark 
color, put into cans that have been well sterilized, packing as 
tightly as possible. Put the rubber and cover on, and screw 
down cover tightly. Do not sift the pumpkin, for if it once 
gets cool, it will scorch before it will get hot enough again to 
can. The sifting can be done when the cans are opened. 

SQUASH. 

Select good Hubbard squash, being careful to take those 
having a very hard shell. Wash well, cut in pieces, and 
steam in a steam-cooker. When cooked, remove from the 
shell, and mash, seasoning slightly with salt. If too dry, 
add a little boiling water. Then fill the cans, packing down 
well, and pouring a little boiling water over the top. Put on 
the rubber, screw down the cover, and place in a steam- 
cooker or boiler, and cook for two hours. 



COOKED FRUIT. 



BAKED APPLES. 

O ELECT good, tart apples, wash well, and remove the core 
O by inserting a new clothes-pin into the blow end of the 
apple, pressing the ends of the pin together while inserting, 
but letting them expand afterward; then turn the pin around, 
holding the apple firm; pull out the clothes-pin, and the core 
will come out. Fill the cavity with sugar, place in a granite 
pie tin, putting about 2 tablespoonfuls of water in the tin, and 
place in a moderately hot oven; bake until the apples are 
done, but not mushy. Remove from the oven, fill the cavi- 
ties with the beaten white of i egg which has been sweetened 
with i tablespoonful of granulated sugar, place a blanched 
almond on the top of each, and return to the oven just long 
enough to cook the egg, which will require only two or three 
minutes. Serve hot or cold. 



BAKED SWEET APPLES. 

The Talman sweet apple is the best for baking. Select 
some that are about the same size, and not wormy. Wash 

i J 

well, leaving stem on. Put into a granite pie tin, with 2 
tablespoonfuls of water, and bake in a moderately hot oven 
for three or four hours, until they are very soft clear through. 
They will then be sweet and juicy. 

[222] 



COOKED FRUIT. 223 

BAKED PEARS. 

Select pears that are ripe and quite mellow, and of about 
the same size. \Yash well, and remove cores with a sharp 
knife, cutting in from the blow end. Put in a granite basin 
or pie tin, with a little water added, and bake in a moderately 
heated oven until they are very tender, which will take from 
one to three hours, according to the mellowness of the pears. 
When thoroughly baked, set them upon the stem end, and 
fill the cavity where the core was removed with a meringue 
made of the white of i egg, I tablespoonful of sugar, and | 
teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Then place on the frosting 
two or three pine-nuts, and return to the oven for two or 
three minutes to set the egg. They may be served hot or 
cold, and are far superior to baked apples. 

BAKED BANANAS. 

Select bananas that are not too ripe, strip off the peeling, 
and roll in an egg that has been beaten, afterward rolling in 
finely ground zwieback. Place them on oiled tins, and bake 
in the oven until nicely browned. As soon as removed from 
the oven, roll them in pulverized sugar, and serve hot. 

BAKED PEACHES. 

Select good, fine-grained peaches; peel, cut into halves, 
and remove the pits. Roll in a beaten egg and cracker- 
crumbs, the same as the baked bananas. Bake on an oiled 
tin until nicely browned, and then roll in pulverized sugar. 

APPLE CUTLETS. 

Take six good, tart apples, pare, and slice crosswise, hav- 
ing the slices about one fourth of an inch thick. Dip each 
slice into peanut cream, and roll in finely ground or grated 



224 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

zwieback. Place on oiled tins, and bake in a moderately 
heated oven until nicely browned. If a fried appearance is 
desired, brush the top with peanut cream when they have 
begun to brown, using a piece of thin cloth for a brush. 
When done, sprinkle with pulverized sugar. 

BAKED QUINCES. 

Wash some ripe quinces, and bake until soft. When 
cold, strip off the skins, and roll them in powdered sugar. 
Serve cold, with or without nut cream. 

BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

Pare, quarter, and core some mellow, tart apples. Place 
in a bake dish, and cover them so as to keep in all the steam. 
Let them bake until perfectly tender. Remove from the oven, 
and lay them in a glass fruit dish, dusting them with pulverized 
sugar as they are put in. 



DRIED FRUITS. 



SINCE self-sealing cans have become so cheap, there is 
little demand for dried fruits, although a change is often 
a luxury. In drying fruit or sweet corn, the chief thing is to 
evaporate as quickly as possible the water that they contain, 
and keep them from being exposed to the dust and insects. 
An evaporator is the best for drying fruits; but if that can not 
be obtained, the oven is the next best thing. Care should be 
taken, however, not to get the oven too hot. The doors 
should be left open, to allow the steam to escape. The prac- 
tise of drying fruit in the sun is not to be recommended. The 
sun fades the fruit, and when dried in this way, it has lost its 
peculiar flavor, besides having been exposed to flies and other 
insects, as well as to the germ-laden dust. 

TO COOK DRIED FRUIT. 

Before cooking dried fruit, the process of drying must be 
undone as far as possible, bringing the fruit back to its origi- 
nal condition. This may be done by soaking the fruit in 
water over-night, and then cooking in the same water, letting 
it simmer slowly; or it may be steamed in a steam-cooker 
until it is perfectly tender. Care should be taken to keep 
the fruit in as natural a condition as possible. 

DRIED APPLES. 

Look over and wash well; soak overnight, and cook in the 
same water in which they were soaked. Simmer gently for 
three or four hours. When tender, lift from the stew-pan, 

15 [225] 



226 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

with a silver fork, sifting pulverized sugar over the pieces. 
Put into individual sance-dishes. 



DRIED PRUNES. 

The sweet California prunes arc the best. Wash well, 
and soak in plenty of water overnight. Put them in a granite 
stew-pan, and let simmer gently for half a day. By cooking 
them a long time, the sweetness of the fruit is brought out, 
making sugar unnecessary. 

PRUNE PUREE. 

Cook the prunes as in the preceding recipe, and remove 
the skins and pits by sifting through a colander. The prune' 
juice should be drained off before sifting, as the puree should 
be quite thick. If it is too thin, heat it hot, and then 
pour it over the white of an egg which has been beaten to a 
very stiff froth, beating all the time the puree is being 
poured over it. The hot puree will cook the egg sufficiently. 

PRUNE SOUFFLE. 

Wash in boiling water and then soak in cold water over- 
night i cup of prunes. In the morning cook in a steam-cooker 
two or three hours, when they will be perfectly tender. They 
should have barely enough water to cover them when placed 
in the steamer. When cool, sift through a colander, and put 
where it will get very cold. Beat the whites of three eggs 
very stiff and carefully fold into the sifted prunes, pour into 
a pudding dish, and bake in a very quick oven just long 
enough for the egg to set. This may be served either hot 
or cold. 



DRIED FRUIT. 22/ 

DRIED APPLES AND RAISINS. 

Cook the apples as directed in recipe for dried apples, 
and at the same time cook half as many raisins, letting them 
cook very slowly. When the apples are nearly done, put in 
the raisins, and let them simmer together for half an hour. 
The raisins will sweeten the apples sufficiently. 



FRUIT JUICES. 



juice of fruit is much easier to digest than the fruit in 
1 its entirety ; as the seeds, skins, and woody tissues, 
which are so irritating to the weak stomach, are rejected. 
Fruit juice can be used in many ways : as a beverage ; as a 
substitute for cream, when used with grains ; or in the form 
of jelly (without sugar). 

The juice, or sweet wine, can be obtained from all juicy 
fruits. 

GRAPE WINE. 

Select good, ripe fruit, exercising care not to take any 
which is overripe. Unripe fruit is more acid, and does not 
have the delicate flavors found in the ripe fruit; and overripe 
fruit contains germs of fermentation which, if they are not all 
destroyed during the process of wine making, will cause the 
wine to ferment. 

\Yash the grapes well, and separate from the stems. 
Mash them a little with a wooden potato masher, that there 
may be sufficient juice in which to cook them. Place in a 
granite stew-pan, and cook until the seeds are freed from the 
pulp. Pour into a jelly-bag made of two thicknesses of 
cheese-cloth. A good way to make the bag is to double the 
cloth and cut it square, like Fig. I. Place the edge ab upon 
the edge be, and it will then look like Fig. 2. Then sew 
these edges, ab and be, on the machine with a short stitch, 
so that none of the fruit will ooze through. The line tic is

the opening of the bag. Scald the bag with boiling water; 
when cool, wring out, and place in an earthen or granite 
dish, and pour the fruit into the bag. Tie the mouth of the 
bag with a stout twine, and place over the pan a jelly stand, 
lifting the bag and fastening it to the top; or, if there is no 
stand handy, fasten the bag to a straight stick, letting the 
stick rest upon the backs of two chairs, and allowing the 
point of the bag to hang over the earthen or granite dish. 
Do not squeeze the bag, as that will press out some of the

pulp. Allow it to drain overnight, or for several hours. In 
the morning heat the juice which has accumulated in the ves- 
sel, until the boiling-point is reached; then sweeten with ^ 
cup of sugar to each quart of juice. Pour the hot juice into 
well-sterilized cans, and seal the same as fruit. Beer bottles, 
with rubber, self-sealing corks, are excellent for canning wine. 
The sugar may be omitted if desired. 



STRAWBERRY WINE. 

Take good, ripe strawberries, and wash well, removing all 
sand and dirt. Remove hulls, and rewash very carefully, not 
bruising the berries. Let them drain until dry; then place in 
a granite or earthen dish, and mash with a wooden potato 
masher. A glass bottle, if large enough, will serve as a 
masher. When well mashed, turn into a jelly-bag, made as 



GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

described under Grape Wine, and hang up the bag, allowing 
the juice to drain out. Do not squeeze the bag. In the fun- 
nel-shaped bag, the juice will settle in the lower point, and 
the weight of the fruit above will cause the juice to ooze out. 
The contents of the bag will be quite dry, after standing for a 
few hours. Heat the juice to the boiling-point, turn into 
cans, and seal. 

HUCKLEBERRY WINE. 

Take good, ripe berries, those that are large and juicy. 
Look over, throwing out all green and soft ones. Put in a 
granite stew-pan, adding a very little water (about I cup for 
5 quarts of berries), and set on the stove to cook. Stir them 
frequently, and just as they start to boil, remove from the 
stove, pour into the jelly-bag, and let the juice drain out. 
Heat the juice to the boiling-point and can. It is best not to 
sweeten the juice when canning, as it can be sweetened when 
used; and if it is desired for jelly, it is better without sugar. 

RASPBERRY WINE. 

Select good, plump, ripe raspberries, look over, and wash, 
letting them drain until quite dry ; then mash in an earthen 
or granite dish, and pour into a jelly-bag or two thicknesses 
of cheese-cloth, and squeeze out all the juice. The berries 
may be cooked before getting out the juice ; but the cooked 
seeds give the juice a spicy taste. Some, however, like this 
taste, while others prefer to have the fruit uncooked. Heat 
the juice to the boiling-point, and can without sugar. 

BLACKBERRY WINE. 

Make in the same way as raspberry wine, and can with- 
out sugar. 



FRUIT JUICES. 231 

CURRANT WINE. 

Select good, ripe fruit, wash well, and pick from the 
stems. Place them in an earthen or granite pan, and mash 
the berries. Put into a strong jelly-bag, and squeeze out all 
the juice possible. Then heat the juice, and can the same 
as other wines. 

CHERRY WINE. 

Select the sweet black cherry, pull off the stems, and 
reject all wormy ones. Wash well, and cook in a granite 
stew-pan, adding enough water nearly to cover them, and 
stirring quite often. Allow it to cool, and pour into a jelly- 
bag, squeezing all the juice out. Reheat to the boiling-point, 
and can the same as other wines. 

Other cherries may be used, but the wine will be more 
acid. 

PLUM WINE. 

Most of the plum family are too acid to make palatable 
wine. However, the Goldendrop is an exception. Wash 
well, and remove the stems. Place in a granite stew-pan, 
adding enough water nearly to cover them. Cook slowly for 
an hour or more. Pour into a funnel-shaped bag, and allow 
the fruit to drain, being careful not to squeeze it or the pulp 
may go through the bag, into the juice, causing it to lose its 
clearness. Reheat the juice, and can without sugar the same 
as other wines. After the juice is taken out, the pulp that is 
left in the bag may be sifted through the colander, and used 
for sauce. 

QUINCE WINE. 

Select fruit as nearly ripe as possible, wash well, and cut 
into eighths without paring, but remove the core. Cook 
slowly in a granite stew-pan for two hours. Pour into a jelly- 



232 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

l>ag, and allow it to drain. Do not squeeze. Reheat juice, 
and when boiling hot, seal in glass cans. The quality of the 
wine may be improved by cooking an equal quantity of sweet 
apples with the quinces. 

SWEET-APPLE WINE. 

Select some sweet apples of good flavor, such as the 
Talman sweet, golden sweet, or Bailey's sweet. Wash well, 
cut into pieces, without paring or removing the core, cook 
slowly for two hours, and pour into a jelly-bag, allowing all 
the juice to drain out that will without squeezing the bag. 
Heat the juice to the boiling-point, and can the same as 
other wines. 

MULBERRY WINE. 

Gather the mulberries fresh from the tree, mash well, and 
put into a jelly-bag, squeezing out all the juice possible. 
Sweeten slightly, heat to the boiling-point, and can in the 
same manner as other wines. 



JELLIES. 



ALL fruit juices do not contain sufficient pectose to form 
a jelly, and only a few kinds of fruit will make jelly 
without sugar. Those that are the easiest to jelly, are the 
Siberian crab-apple, Snow apple, quince, currant, gooseberry, 
cranberry, and grape. 

The usual method of making jelly is to use equal quanti- 
ties of juice and sugar. This, however, makes a sauce too 
rich to be healthful. Its transparent beauty as it stands 
upon the plate, pleasing the eye and giving an artistic finish 
to the appearance of the table, is something that the house- 
wife naturally dislikes to banish ; and hence her inventive 
powers are put to work to keep the beauty, and at the same 
time produce a toothsome and harmless dish. 

There is certainly nothing injurious in the pure juice of 
fruit. Indeed, it is less harmful than the fruit in its natural 
state, as the skins, seeds, and fibrous tissue have been 
rejected. If in this state it could be made, without the aid 
of sugar, into jelly, it would be perfectly wholesome. 

This has been found to be possible with some fruits. 
Other fruit juices which will not jelly alone, can be made to 
do so by the use of sago. When sago is used, it is best not 
to keep the jelly long, but make it as it is required for use. 

The juice of the fruits may be extracted in the fruit sea- 
son, and canned, ready to be used at any time. In making 
jelly always use a good granite or porcelain-lined kettle, as 
tin or iron coming in contact with acid fruit not only spoils 
its delicate flavor, but renders it more difficult to digest. 

[233] 



234 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

APPLE JELLY. 

This may be made from almost any apples, although the 
Siberian crab-apple is the best, as it contains more pectose, 
and will jelly more easily. Do not pare, but core the apples, 
after washing well, and cutting into pieces. Slowly boil in a 
porcelain or granite stew-pan for an hour or more, and pour 
into a jelly-bag, allowing all the juice to drain out that will 
without squeezing. Pour juice back into stew-pan, and cook 
until one half of it has evaporated; then add just enough 
sugar to sweeten (about | of a cupful to i quart of juice), and 
allow it to boil for twenty minutes. Pour into glass jelly cups 
or glass pint cans, and seal in the same manner as fruit is 
sealed. It will not keep without sealing, as do jellies which 
are one half sugar. 

CRANBERRY JELLY. 

Examine the cranberries, throwing out all soft ones. Put 
in a granite stew-pan, pouring in sufficient water to cover the 
berries, and cook until the skins burst. Put through a 
colander or fruit press to take out the skins. Boil the pulp .nd 
juice until one third of the quantity has evaporated, after which 
add sufficient sugar to make palatable,-- about i cup of sugar 
to i quart of cranberries before they are cooked. Boil about 
twenty minutes after adding sugar. Can in self-sealing cans; 
or, if for immediate use, pour while hot into the mold, and 
set away to get perfectly cold, when the mixture should be 
very firm,-- sufficiently so to allow slicing with a knife. If 
only the juice of the cranberry is used, a much more clear 
and transparent jelly may be obtained. However, the pulp 
will cause it to become more solid and firm, with less 
boiling. 



JELLIES. 235 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Take the juice from the currant as directed in recipe for 
Currant Wine. Put into a granite stew-pan, and let it boil 
until one half of the quantity has evaporated; then add 
enough sugar to make palatable,-- about i cup to i quart of 
the juice. No sugar need be added, however, unless desired, 
as the juice will jelly without it, but is slightly too acid to be 
relished. Let it boil for twenty minutes after the addition of 
the sugar, and then pour into glass pint cans. Place them on a 
tray or board, cover with a glass, and set them out in the sun- 
shine for several hours. If they are to be sealed, put on 
covers and seal while the jelly is hot, and then put them 
out in the sunshine. The sunlight will materially thicken 
the jelly. 

Sunlight makes better jelly than that made by any other 
process, but it is quite tedious to make in this way. It may 
be done by filling tumblers about two thirds full of fruit juice, 
sweetened to suit the taste. Cover with a pane of glass, and 
set out in the bright sunlight. Three or four days is the time 
required to make a firm jelly in this manner; but it will be 
much lighter colored, and have a much better flavor. This 
method is especially valuable in making grape and huckleberry 
jellies, as boiling makes them almost black in color. If a 
very light-colored jelly is desired, take the juice of the white 
currant or the quince, and make jelly from it by the sunlight 
process. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Use the quince wine, and make it the same as apple 
jelly (see recipes for Quince Wine and Apple Jelly). It can 
be made without sugar, but is better when sweetened a 



236 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

little, as it is quite acid. A less acid jelly and an equally 
well-flavored one can be obtained by using half sweet- 
apple juice. 

SWEET-APPLE JELLY. 

Take the juice of sweet apples, such as Talman Sweets. 
However, any kind will probably do as well, if they are juicy 
and sweet. Put the juice in a stew-pan, and boil until only 
one fourth of the quantity remains. Then add a very little 
sugar for flavoring (about i tablespoonful to i quart), and let 
it boil for twenty minutes. Remove from the stove, cover, 
and allow to stand until the next day. If it is not quite firm 
enough, reheat it, and when it reaches the boiling-point, let 
it cook for ten or fifteen minutes; then seal it in cans. If 
not very firm at first, it may be thickened by placing it in the 
window where the sun may shine upon it. 

RASPBERRY JELLY. 

Take the raspberry wine (see recipe), and boil it until only 
one third of the quantity remains, after which add an amount 
of sugar sufficient to make it palatable, which will perhaps be 
about i cupful for each quart of red raspberries, and a some- 
what smaller quantity for the black ones. Allow it to boil for 
twenty minutes longer, pour into glass pint cans, and seal. 
If not quite the right consistency, it may be made more firm 
by being placed in the sunlight for a day or two. 

BLACKBERRIES AND MULBERRIES. 

The juice of these fruits may be jellied the same as the 
raspberries. However, the mulberry does not. require more 
than a very small quantity of sugar, only i tablespoonful to 
each pint of juice. 



JELLIES. 237 

GRAPE JELLY. 

This is best made just before it is wanted for use. Take 
some of the canned grape wine (see recipe), and add sugar 
to taste. Pour into a glass dish, or more than one dish if 
there should be more than a pint; for it is better not to have 
it too deep in the dish. Cover with a glass, and set in the 
sunlight, allowing it to be in the light for three or four days; 
at the end of which time it will in all probability be an excel- 
lent jelly, more lightly colored and of a better flavor than it 
would have been had it been boiled. However, if desired, it 
may be boiled in the same way as other jellies. Be careful, 
though, not to add sugar until the boiled juice is nearly ready 
to be removed from the stove. 

PEACH JELLY. 

Peach juice will not jelly without the aid of sugar, although 
a very pretty mold jelly can be made of it by the use of sago 
to thicken it. The peach peelings are better than the entire 
peach, as the pectose is nearly all next to the skin. 

Wash the peaches well before paring, and then take the 
parings and cook them for an hour or more. Strain through 
cheese-cloth, and return the juice to the stove, boiling until 
only one third of the quantity remains. Then add a little 
sugar to make it palatable; also add to each quart of the 
juice | cup of sago, which has been prepared by being thor- 
oughly washed, and soaked in cold water for two or three 
hours. Allow this mixture to boil for twenty minutes, watch- 
ing to see that it does not stick on the bottom. Pour into an 
oiled mold, to cool. After becoming cold, it may be loos- 
ened from the edges, and turned upon the dish in which it is 
to be served. 



23$ GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

PEAR JELLY. 

Pears are similar to peaches, in that they will not jelly 
without the addition of sugar or something to thicken the 
juice. Make the same as peach jelly, adding the sugar 
and sago about twenty minutes before juice is taken from 
the stove. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Take the juice of the strawberry (see Strawberry Wine 
recipe), pour into a granite stew-pan, and boil until two 
thirds of it has been evaporated, after which add to the 
remaining third sufficient sugar to suit the taste (about i 
cup to each quart), and boil twenty minutes longer. Try 
a small amount, putting it upon a cold dish. If it jellies, 
remove from the stove; pour into glass pint cans, and seal. 
If a very clear jelly should be desired, beat the white of 
i egg for each quart of juice, and add to the juice before 
heating. When it begins to boil, the egg will come to the 
top, bringing all the small particles of pulp and skin with 
it. It may then be skimmed off, and the jelly will be clear. 
Care should be taken always to remove the scum from the 
jelly as soon as it rises to the surface. 

HUCKLEBERRY JELLY. 

Use the juice of the huckleberry, prepared the same as 
for huckleberry wine. Pour juice into a granite stew-pan, 
and cook it until only one half of the original quantity 
remains. Add ^ cup of sugar to each quart of the juice, 
after which boil for fifteen or twenty minutes more. Try 
a small amount in a saucer; and if it should thicken, it is 
ready to be canned or molded. The huckleberry is not 
very acid, and is therefore quite appetizing when only a 



JELLIES 239 

little sprinkling- of sugar, sufficient to bring out the taste 
of the berry, is added. It makes a very dark jelly; but 
it is nice to use between layers of white cakes, or upon 
puddings, because of the striking contrast in the colors. 
It can be eaten by those who can not eat acid fruits; and 
as the skins have been rejected, it is easy of digestion, be- 
sides being very edible and nutritious. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

Take the gooseberry just before it begins to ripen. 
Cook in a small quantity of water, and pour into a jelly- 
bag, draining overnight or for several hours. Pour the juice 
into a stew-pan, and boil until only one half of it remains, 
after which add sugar to suit the taste,- - about i cup to 
each quart of juice. Boil twenty minutes longer, skimming 
off scum as it rises. Test a small quantity in a saucer. 
If it jellies, remove from stove, and can or mold. Ripe 
gooseberries are much sweeter, but will not jelly without 
the addition of sugar or sago to thicken. 

\ 

PINEAPPLE JELLY. 

Select a good, ripe pineapple, cut off the crown, and 
cut the apple into quarters, cutting from the crown to the 
stem end. Remove the hard, pithy core, and grate the 
rest, grating as closely to the skin as possible. When all 
is grated, put into a granite stew-pan, and boil until nearly 
one half the juice has boiled 'away; then add sugar enough 
to suit the taste,-- perhaps about I cup to each quart of 
juice. Let this mixture boil until it jellies, which can be 
ascertained by testing a little in a saucer. It usually will 
not take over twenty minutes. Can and seal the same 
as fruit. 



24O GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

LEMON JELLY. 

Cook cup of sago in i.\ cups of water, until it be- 
comes a thick jelly, and is of an even consistency. It is best 
to cook it in a double boiler, as it is less liable to become 
lumpy, and will not scorch on the bottom. When done, 
add J cup of lemon-juice, i cup of sugar, and a little 
strong saffron tea, just enough to make it a lemon color. 
Boil for four or five minutes, and turn into molds. When 
cool, turn upon a plate, and decorate with slices of lemon 
around the bottom, and blanched almonds or pine-nuts upon 
the top. 

TOMATO JELLY. 

Stew i quart of tomatoes until they are soft. Strain the 
pulp through a fine wire sieve, or a cheese-cloth bag. To each 
pint of strained tomatoes, add ^ cup of granulated sugar, and 
i tablespoonful of corn-starch which has been dissolved in ^ 
cup of cold water. Put this mixture into a double boiler, and 
cook for twenty minutes, stirring until it begins to thicken. 
Turn into molds, and allow to become cold. 

ORANGE BASKETS. 

A very unique way of serving jelly is in baskets made from 
oranges. Select seven symmetrical oranges of an equal size, 
choosing those having a fresh, bright golden rind. Wash 
thoroughly and wipe dry. With a sharp knife, cut them into 
baskets, letting a part of the rind remain to serve as the han- 
dle. After having removed the two sections, the knife may 
easily be run underneath the rind, on the inside, separating it 
from the pulp of the fruit. Then cut away the top part of 
the orange. The top part of the pulp may be taken out 



JELLIES. 241 

whole, and served with the basket, if desired. With a spoon 
press out the remaining juice in the basket, and with the aid 
of the fingers, loosen the fibrous tissues from the rind, remov- 
ing them and leaving the rind free. 

The baskets are then ready for trimming. Wipe them 
as dry as possible, and trim around the edge with a frosting

made by beating stiff half of the white of I egg, and adding 
enough pulverized sugar to knead well; then take a small 
piece and roll on a marble slab or large platter until it forms 
a smooth roll of the same size in diameter throughout its 
length. The roll should be about as large as a small lead- 
pencil. Put this upon the edges of the basket, and press 
down from the inside. See the accompanying cut, from 
which you can form an idea how to make the baskets, as

well as the manner of putting on the frosting. If desired, 
the frost in,- may bo omitted, and the edge of the cup scalloped 
or notched Just prior to serving, till with any bright red 
jelly. Place a basket at each plate. 

JELLIED ORANGES. 

Delect good, large Florida oranges. Cut a small hole in 
the blow end, and remove the juice and fiber of the orange. 
Then put the orange "shells" on in cold water, and let them 
come to a boil. This will remove the bitter taste from the 
white portion of the orange. Then fill the orange shells with 
some good, stiff jelly. The jelly should be warm when put 
in, and allowed to become cold. When ready to serve, cut 
the orange into quarters, cutting through the jelly. Serve a 
quarter each in individual sauce-dishes. This makes a very 
striking, artistic dish. 

BAKED APPLES AND BUTTER. 

Select good, tart apples, remove the core, and fill the 
cavity with a mixture of peanut butter and sugar, about half 
and half, and a little sprinkling of sassafras. Mix the ingre- 
dients well before filling in. Bake in a moderate oven until 
tender, but do not leave too long as they will fall to pieces. 
Serve cold, with or without cream. 

GRAPE APPLE. 

Select any good, tart apple, pare, quarter, and core. 
Steam in a steam-cooker with a little water until perfectly 
tender, but not until it has fallen to pieces. Take some 
grape juice, dilute it one half, sweeten to taste, put in the 
steamed apples, and let them stand in the hot juice for ten 



JELLIES. 243 

minutes; but the juice must not boil or the apples will become 
mushy. When done, the apples should be of a bright pink 
color. 

STRAWBERRY FRITTERS. 

Take 2 eggs, I cup of almond cream, a pinch of salt, and 
flour enough to make a thin batter. Crush I pint of straw- 
berries, sweeten and spread them between 2 slices of bread, 
cut in any shape desired; press well together, dip in the bat- 
ter, and cook on a soapstone under a cover. Any fruit jams 
or jellies may be used instead of strawberries. Some prefer 
to have the bread buttered with nut butter before putting in 
the fruit.

LEGUMES. 



THE Legume family consists of peas, beans, lentils, and like 
foods. The peanut may be classed with this family also, 
although it is commonly classed with nuts. The peanut 
resembles nuts on account of its richness in fats, but in other 
respects resembles the legume. Legumes are very rich in 
nutritive elements, and are well adapted to take the place of 
meat. They are indeed much richer in muscle-making mate- 
rial, having more than three times the amount of albumen 
contained in meat, but the best of it all is they do not contain 
any poison or decaying tissue as does the meat. Legumes 
require prolonged cooking; three or four hours is not too 
long. The long cooking brings out their richness and flavor, 
and makes them palatable without any seasonings with the 
exception of a little salt. 

STEWED BEANS. 

Select small, white, navy-beans, as they are easier to cook, 
and their skin is thin, tender, and easily masticated. Let 
them soak overnight, and in the morning put them to cook in 
cold water (soft water is best), cooking gently until perfectly 
tender. Add salt to suit the taste, and \ cup of peanut cream 
to each pint of cooked beans. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Look over, wash, and soak overnight i pint of white 
beans. In the morning cook in soft water if possible ; hard 
water will do, but it takes longer to cook them. Cook until 

I -4" 1 



LEGUMES. 247 

tender but not mushy. Season with salt, pour over them nut 
cream made of nut butter until it nearly covers them, and 
bake in the oven three or four hours, stirring occasionally. 
When done, they should be a rich brown color clear through. 
A little sugar or molasses may be added if desired. 

MALT BAKED BEANS. 

Prepare like the preceding recipe; when tender, add salt 
to taste, and for each quart of cooked beans add I tablespoon- 
ful of nut butter and i tablespoonful of malt extract. Bake 
in a bean baker if you have one ; if not, a common bake dish 
will do, but more liquid will be necessary on account of the 
evaporation. They should be covered with nut milk, and 
stirred occasionally to keep the top ones from getting hard. 
Baking for a long time improves them very much. 

BEAN OMELET. 

Take I cup of sifted beans (the small white navy-bean is 
the best), 3 eggs (the whites and yolks beaten separately), 
and A teaspoonful of salt. Fold the well-beaten yolk into the 
beans, which should be put through a colander or sieve. The 
salt should be added to the whites, and they should be beaten 
very stiff, and then carefully folded in. Put in a bake tin, 
and bake in a quick oven until they are a nice brown shade. 

They may be cooked in the frying-pan if desired, and 
one half folded upon the other. The pan must be oiled 
with nut oil. 

NUT MEATOSE BEANS. 

Prepare and cook the beans as for stewed beans, but 
before they are very tender, cut nutmeatose into small 
cubes, using about i cup of the nutmeatose to i pint of the 



248 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

cooked beans, salt to taste, and gently fold them together, 
and pour into a bean baker, allowing plenty of water. Bake 
for three or four hours, or as long as possible to have them 
ready for dinner. A half-hour before serving, remove the 
cover and allow them to brown on top. They should be quite 
dry when done. If a bean baker can not be had, bake in an 
earthen pan, and cover with a kettle cover. 

MASHED BEANS AND POTATOES. 

Take i cup of beans that have been rubbed through a 
colandrr, and add to them i cup of mashed potatoes, and 
salt and nut butter to suit the taste. Mix all very thoroughly 
and heat in a spider, stirring occasionally until they are 
quite dry. Cold left-over potatoes and beans are just as good. 

STEWED LIMA BEANS. 

Look over, wash, and put to cook in cold water on the 
ba< k of the stove or where they will not cook fast. When 
perfectly tender, season with salt and nut butter, and serve. 

BAKED LIMA BEANS. 

When ready to cook, put in cold water and let come to a 
boil. When the skins look puffed and loose from the bean, 
drain off the water and pour over them a little cold water, 
letting it drain off. Then take the beans between the fingers 
and press them, and the beans will slip out from the skins. 
It will not take long to remove the skins from a mess of 
beans. Then put to cook, stirring occasionally, that they do 
not stick to the kettle. When cooked to a mush and per- 
fectly smooth and quite dry, season with salt and nut butter 
to taste, and bake in a pudding dish until of a nice brown. 
Serve hot. 



LEGUMES. 249 

STEWED KIDNEY BEANS. 

Take I cup of dry kidney-beans, wash well, put on in cold 
water, and cook slowly for three hours or more, until perfect ly 
tender. When nearly done, salt to taste, and just before 
serving, flavor with nut butter. 

KIDNEY-BEAN ROAST. 

Cook the beans as in the previous recipe, and sift through 
a colander. Then to I pint of sifted beans use I pint of sifted 
peanuts, \ cup of zwieola (see recipe for making zwieola), 
and i teaspoonful of salt, and if desired a little sage and 
grated onion may be used. Mix all the ingredients together. 
If too dry, a little nut milk may be added. Turn into an 
oiled bake dish, and bake to a nice brown. 

SIFTED PEAS. 

Soak Scotch peas overnight; in the" morning look over, 
discarding all the poor ones, wash, and boil in soft water. 
Let them boil quite hard for the first half-hour, as that will 
remove the skins, and they will come to the top and can be 
skimmed off, making it easier to sift. When perfectly tender, 
put through a colander. Season with salt and nut butter to 
taste, and bake in the oven. Serve hot. 

PEAS BAKED WITH NUTMEATO. 

Take 3 cups of sifted peas (prepared according to preceding 
recipe), i cup of nutmeato grated or mashed. Season with 
sage and salt to taste; lastly add the beaten white of the egg. 
Put in an oiled tin, and bake until nicely browned. Grated 
onion or celery may be added instead of the sage if desired.

CANNED GREEN PEAS WITH NUTMEATO. 

Cut the nutineato into small pieces, about one-third inch 
cubes, and cook in a little water for two hours in a double 
boiler or in a dish set on the back part of the stove where it w r ill 
not boil but gently simmer. Meanwhile cook the peas until 
tender; when done, they should In- quite dry; flavor with salt 
to taste and add the cooked nutineato. Serve while hot. 

VEGETABLE TURKEY. 

To i pint of sifted "peas add about i cup) of water; the 
quantity to be added depends upon the amount of moisture in 
the peas; then add i well-beaten egg, I tablespoonful of nut 
butter dissolved in a little water, 2 tablespoonfuls of granola, 
and sage and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly, and bake in an 
oiled pudding dish until brown; it should be quite dry when 
done. 

STEWED SPLIT PEAS. 

Look over, wash, and put to cook in cold water (soft 
water is preferable); cook very slowly, allowing them to 
swell, being careful that they do not get dry and burn. 
Replenish with hot water if needed; cook until mushy. Sea- 
son with salt to suit the taste, and if desired, add i teaspoonful 
of nut butter to I pint of the stewed peas. 

BAKED SPLIT PEAS. 

Cook like the preceding recipe, letting them boil very dry; 
then add salt to suit the taste, and to each pint of the cooked

SIFTED LENTILS. 

Look over and wash the lentils well and put to soak in 
cold water for at least two hours, longer if possible. Then 
cook slowly until perfectly tender, and rub through a colan- 
der. Season with salt and a little nut butter if desired. 
Lentils, like peas and beans, are so rich in nutrition that they 
need very little seasoning. 

BAKED SIFTED LENTILS. 

Look over, wash, and put to soak overnight, or at least 
for two or three hours; then put into cold soft water and cook 
slowly for two or three hours, or until they are perfectly 
tender. If cooked in hard water, it will take much longer. 
Sift through a colander to remove the skins. Season with a 
pinch of salt, and a very little nut cream if desired. Bake in 
the oven until brown on top. 

SAVORY LENTILS. 

Take I cup of sifted lentils and i cup of bread-crumbs. 
Moisten with rich nut milk, and add \ teaspoonful of sage, i 
teaspoonful of minced parsley, and salt to taste. Bake until 
firm. 

VEGETABLE ROAST. 

Take 2 cups of strained lentils, i cup of strained tomatoes, 
| cup of mashed nutmeato, f cup of mixed granola and glu- 
ten, i egg, and onion and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly, and 
bake in a basin until solid enough to slice when cold. 

BOILED PEANUTS. 

First blanch the peanuts, which can be done by heating

and when nearly cold, the skins can easily be removed by 
rubbing in the sieve or between the hands; or they can be 
blanched by pouring boiling water on them, and letting them 
-land in it until the skins become loosened; then rub off with 
the hands. When blanched, put into cold soft water to cook, 
as they cook quicker in soft water than in hard water --in 
about one half the time. \Vhen perfectly tender, salt and 
let stew until they are well seasoned throughout. Serve hot. 

MASHED PEANUTS WITH TOMATO. 

Boil the peanuts as in the previous recipe. Mash with a 
wooden potato masher or rub through a colander,-- the latter 
is preferable. Then to i\ cups of quite dry sifted peanuts 
add A cup of sifted tomatoes and salt to taste. Reheat, and 
if too thin, let some of the moisture evaporate. Serve hot. 

BAKED PEANUTS. 

Take I pint of sifted peanuts, add \ teaspoonful of salt, i 
well-beaten egg, and 2 tablespoonfuls of granola, or grated 
/wieback will do. Mix all well together and put in an oiled 
tin, and bake until brown in a moderate oven. Serve hot 

PEA AND PECAN PUREE. 

Cook i.\ cups of Scotch peas until tender, being careful 
to have them quite dry when done. Rub through a colander 
and add to them i cup of strained tomatoes, I cup of pecan 
meal, and salt to suit the taste. Reheat and serve. 

PEA PUREE. 

Take 2 cups of sifted peas and 2 teaspoonfuls of white 
flour. Rub the Hour smooth in a little cold water, add to the 
peas, and cook in a double boiler for fifteen minutes. If 
desired, add ^ tablespoonfuls of lemon- or tomato-juice. 



VEGETABLES, 



r PHl vegetables belong to that class of foods of which the 
1 Lord spoke when he said to Adam, "Thou shalt eat the 
herb of the field." Gen. 3:18. They consist of the leaves, 
stalks, and tubers, as well as the seed pods and unripe seeds 
of plants. 

Vegetables are not as nutritious as either the grains or the 
legumes, nor as easily digested, but are useful in the bill of 
fare, as they afford a variety, and can be obtained in all parts 
of the world. They also give bulk to the food so that one is 
not so likely to overeat. They contain salts in a form that 
the system can use, as well as phosphate and other elements 
essential for the blood. 

\Yhen vegetables are properly cooked and are combined 
with the right foods, they are not so hard of digestion, 
and many nutritious and palatable dishes can be made 
from them. 

Great care should be taken to see that they are well 
cooked and yet not overdone. If they are not thoroughly 
done, it makes harder work for the digestive organs, neither 
are they so palatable; and if they are overdone, it renders 
them soggy and tasteless. 

Vegetables should be served as soon as cooked, as standing 
injures their taste more than that of most foods. 

Green vegetables should be used as soon as gathered or as 
soon after as possible. Sweet corn especially looses much of 
its flavor by standing.

Vegetables and fruit should not be eaten at the same 
meal, as they form a bad combination. The Lord has given 
us light upon this subject if we will only look for it. He has 
told us, If we would preserve the best health, we should 
avoid eating vegetables and fruit at the same meal. If the 
stomach is feeble, there will be distress, and the brain will 
be confused, and unable to put forth mental effort. Have 
fruit at one meal and vegetables at the next." The Youth's 
Instructor, May 31, iXyj.. 

But vegetables are classed in with other foods that make 
a healthful diet. "Fruits, -rains, and vegetables prepared 
in a simple way, free from spice and grease of all kinds, make 
with milk and cream the most healthful diet. They impart 
nourishment to the body, and give a power of endurance and 
vigor of intellect that are not produced by a stimulating diet." 
- ' ' Heal tli ful Living* " />(*>'. v/ iS - 

" Meat eating is doing its work, for the meat is diseased. 
We may not long be able to use even milk." -"Healthful 
Li-cing" par. 3+9. 

"The Lord intends to bring his people back to live upon 
simple fruits, vegetables, and grains." 

POTATOES. 

The potato is the tuber of a plant that is a native of the 
Andes from Chile to as far north as New Mexico. It was 
scarcely known until the seventeenth century, but since that 
time has been widely cultivated, and now produces a large 
portion of the food of civilized man. 

There are many varieties of the potato, differing in size, 
color, and quality. The varieties usually cultivated are the 
common white, or Irish, and the sweet, or yellow, potato. 
Ol these the sweet potato contains the more food proper- 



VEGETABLES. 255 

ties, having" a total nutritive value of over twenty-seven 
percent.; while the total nutritive value of the Irish potato 
is about twenty-four per cent. The potato has the high- 
est nutritive value of any of the vegetables. It consists 
principally of starch, but also contains potash, salts, and a 
srhall percentage of albuminous material, which are needed 
in the blood. The potato, when properly cooked, should be 
dry and mealy ; then it is easy of digestion, as the starch cells 
have burst, and can be digested by the saliva ; but if it is 
soggy and heavy, it is hard of digestion. 

The reason why some people think potatoes are hard to 
digest is because they are combined with other foods which 
make it seem so. When eaten with fruits or dairy milk, 
there is a disturbance in the digestive canal, which is laid to 
the potato, but really belongs to the poor combination of 
foods. When eaten with nuts, grains, or other vegetables, 
the difficulty will be obviated. 

The potato should be cooked until it is mealy, and 
this is best done by putting to cook in boiling water, being 
careful not to cook too long, or they will get watery; but they 
should be thoroughly done, or the starch cells will not have 
been bursted, and can not be reached or acted upon by the 
saliva. 

BOILED POTATOES <IN JACKETS). 

Select medium-sized, smooth potatoes, scrub them well 
with a vegetable brush in several waters. Drop them into 
boiling water, and cook until tender; then drain, place back 
on the stove, and let them dry, raising the kettle and shaking 
to let the steam escape until they are mealy and the skins 
crack. Serve at once in their jackets, with nut gravy made 
of raw peanut milk. 



256 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

POTATOES STEWED WITH CELERY. 

Pare and slice 4 medium-sized potatoes, and mix with 
tin-in 2 tablespoonfuls of minced celery, using only the white 
and tender part of the celery. Cover the whole with nut 
milk, made from almond or peanut butter. Season with salt 
to taste and bake or stew until tender. Serve hot. 

ESCALLOPED POTATOES. 

Take 6 medium-sized potatoes, pare and slice them, and 
place a layer in the bottom of an oiled baking dish, sprinkle 
with Hour and salt. Then add another layer of potatoes, etc. 
Pour over all enough nut milk to cover it. Place in the oven 
and bake slowly until tender. A grated onion or celery salt 
may he added if desired. 

POTATO SOUFFLE. 

Take i cupful of mashed potatoes, i egg, i tablespoonful 
of nut cream, and salt to taste. Beat the yolk of the egg 
light, and add to the mashed potatoes with the cream and 
salt. Beat until very smooth and light; add the white of 
ilu- i'gg' whipped to a stiff, dry froth, carefully folding it in; 
turn into a greased baking dish, and brown in a quick oven. 

POTATO PUFFS. 

Take i cup of mashed potatoes, i egg, \ cup of nut cream, 
and salt to taste. Beat the egg light without separating. 
and add to the mashed potatoes with the cream and salt. 
Brat until quite light. Fill oiled gem irons with the mixture, 
and bake in a quick oven. Take out carefully with a limber 
knife, and serve at once on a heated dish. 



VEGETABLES. 257 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Bake 4 large, oval-shaped potatoes; while hot, cut through 
center, crosswise. Dig out inside with a spoon. Season 
with nut cream and salt; whip until snowy white. Fill the 
shells again with this mixture. Stand them upright in a 
baking dish, and return to the oven until they brown over 
the top. If a fancy dish is desired, the potatoes may be 
wrapped in fringed tissue paper, and set with the cut side up 
in the platter in which they are served. 

WARMED-OVER POTATOES. 

Cut the potatoes quite fine or chop them and mix with 
nut butter- - about i tablespoonful of butter to I pint of 
potatoes. When thoroughly mixed, form or press into cakes 
and place in frying-pan or spider, then put on the back part 
of the stove where it will cook slowly. It will not need any 
fat to keep it from sticking, as the nut butter in the potatoes 
will oil the spider. When brown on one side, turn over and 
brown the other side. Serve hot. 

Browned potatoes, browned mush, and all other dishes to 
which you desire to give a fried flavor, such as croquettes, 
nutmeatose, cutlets, etc., should be dipped in very thin nut 
butter, sprinkled generously with parched corn flour, and 
browned in a quick oven. 

MASHED SWEET POTATOES. 

Wash thoroughly, and remove all bad spots; then boil with 
the skins on until tender. Then remove the skins and mash, 
or it is better to put through a colander. Season with peanut 
cream and salt to taste, and bake in a pudding dish until 
nicely browned. Serve warm.

ESCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES. 

i 

Put well-boiled sweet potatoes through a colander, and to 
2 cups of potatoes add 2 cups of peanut cream, 2 eggs well 
beaten, and 2 tablespoonfuls of zwieola. Salt to taste. Bake 
in the oven until nicely browned. 

PINIC POTATOES. 

Bake as many potatoes as desired ; carefully cut cap off the 
ends so that they can be replaced. Then remove the inside 
of the potatoes with a teaspoon, add salt and a little nut milk, 
and whip it light with a fork; then add to it some tender 
cabbage chopped very fine, seasoned with roasted almond 
meal, celery, salt, lemon-juice, a little chopped parsley, and 
a hard-boiled egg; fold into the light potato and fill the shells. 
Replace the lid with a little sprig of parsley peeping from be- 
neath it. For a fancy dish, they are pretty wrapped in 
fringed paper. 

BROWNED POTATOES. 

Take cold boiled potatoes and slice about one eighth to 
one fourth of an inch thick; place them upon an oiled tin, 
brush them over with peanut cream, and sprinkle upon them 
some corn pepper (see directions for making elsewhere) and 
a little salt; then bake in a very quick oven until the potatoes 
are of a nice brown, and serve at once. 

YOUNG POTATOES. 

Boil until tender, slice, add grated onions, salt, and raw 
peanut milk; bake until done. 



VEGETABLES. 259 



POTATO BALLS. 

Mash some nice mealy potatoes, adding a little nut cream, 
the yolk of i egg, and salt to taste. Beat until very light, 
then roll into balls; brush with a cloth dipped in nut cream, 
place on an oiled tin, and bake in a quick oven. Make the 
balls about the size of the yolk of an egg. 

These are nice to serve with mock fish. 

If preferred, the balls may be coated with equal parts of 
pine-nut and corn-meal rubbed together. 



PARSNIPS. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

When cleaned, halve the parsnips, and boil until tender in 
salted water, and then fry in nutcoa or peanut oil. They are 
as nice as those fried in butter, but we do not recommend 
fried food. 

PARSNIPS WITH EGG SAUCE. 

Clean and slice the parsnips, and cook until tender; salt 
while cooking. Drain off the water if any remains, and pour 
over them an egg sauce as directed. (See index.) 

BAKED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape and cut in halves lengthwise. Cook in boiling, 
salted water until tender, then drain or let boil dry. Roll in 
beaten egg and then in finely grated zwieback. Place the 
flat side down on an oiled tin, and bake a nice brown. 
Serve hot. 



260 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

BOILED CARROTS. 

Wash, scrape, and slice crosswise, and drop into boiling, 
salted water. Cook until very tender (they need prolonged 
cooking). When done, they should be nearly dry. If there 
is too much water, drain off some and season with nut cream 
or pour over them an egg gravy, directions for which are given 
elsewhere. Carrots may be cooked in any of the ways that 
parsnips are cooked. 



SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS. 

In nutritive value they are the same as carrots or parsnips. 
In flavor they resemble the oyster, and are excellent for 
making soups. 

SALSIFY WITH EGG SAUCE. 

Select fresh vegetable oysters, and let them stand in cold 
water for one hour or more before scraping. Then remove the 
skins by means of a sharp knife, and drop into a pan with 
enough cold water to cover. The cold water will prevent 
them from turning black. When all are scraped, slice into a 
granite kettle or double boiler of hot water, and let cook until 
tender. They should be quite dry when done. Salt should 
be added a little before they are done. Then put into the 
dish in which they are to be served, and pour over them an 
egg gravy according to the recipe. (See index.) Serve hot. 

ESCALLOPED SALSIFY. 

Prepare the salsify, or vegetable oysters, like the prece- 
ding recipe, and when tender, place a layer of the oysters in 
the bottom of a pudding dish, and sprinkle over the top a 
little zwieola, then another layer of oysters and more zwieola, 



VEGETABLES. 26 1 

letting- the zwieola be on top. Pour over the whole a sauce 
made of nut milk, a little salt, and I egg. Let it stand for a 
while to soak through to the bottom of the dish. There 
should be enough nut milk thoroughly to moisten the whole. 
Bake twenty or thirty minutes. 



TURNIPS AND RUTABAGAS. 

The nutritive value of the turnip is very low, being only 
about five per cent. The rutabaga is more nutritious, arid both 
are quite easy of digestion if thoroughly cooked. Be sure 
and give plenty of time to cook. Peel deep enough to remove 
the tough, white fibers that are under the skin, as they 
are bitter. 

TURNIP WITH EGG SAUCE. 

Select good, crisp turnips, as the withered and pithy ones 
are not good. Pare, and cut in slices about one third of an inch 
thick. Cook in as little water as possible, which should be 
boiling when the turnips are added. Salt in time to have it 
seasoned through, and let them boil until dry, watching 
closely that they do not burn. Then prepare an egg gravy 
as directed (see index), pouring it over the turnips, and 
serve hot. 

MASHED TURNIPS. 

Pare the turnips, and cut them in halves or quarters, drop 
into boiling, salted water, and cook until perfectly tender. The 
length of time will depend upon the size and age of the turnips, 
but be sure and give them plenty of time. When done, drain 
thoroughly, and add enough thick raw peanut cream to season 
well, and more salt if needed. Mash fine and serve hot. 



262 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



COOKED RUTABAGAS. 

The yellow turnip, or rutabaga, takes considerably longer 
for cooking than the white, but otherwise can be cooked the 
same. They are rather strong flavored, and are improved if 
mixed with an equal quantity of mashed potatoes. The 
cold turnip or rutabaga mixed with potato is nice if a well- 
beaten egg is added, and then made into cakes with the hands, 
placed on oiled tins, brushed over with nut cream, and baked 
in the oven until a nice brown. Serve hot. 



ASPARAGUS. 

ASPARAGUS WITH GRAVY. 

Cut the asparagus as far as tender into half-inch pieces, 
and cook until tender in boiling, salted water. Take out 
the asparagus in a dish, and have ready some nice pieces 
of zwieback; dip them in the water in which the asparagus 
was boiled. Lay them in a dish, and the asparagus on 
top, then make a gravy of i pint of almond or raw pea- 
nut milk, thickened with a tablespoonful of white flour. Salt 
to taste, and pour over the asparagus and toast. Serve 
at once. 

ASPARAGUS WITH NUT CREAM. 

Cook finely sliced asparagus in water until very tender, 
salting a few moments before done. Flavor with almond 
cream made by dissolving i teaspoonful of almond or raw pea- 
nut butter to i pint of the asparagus with its juice. Roasted 
peanut butter does not blend so well with asparagus. 



VEGETABLES. 263 



ASPARAGUS WITH EGG SAUCE, 

Select very tender asparagus cut in one-inch lengths, and 
stew until tender. Salt while cooking. Pour over the cooked 
asparagus an egg gravy; serve warm. Make gravy as directed 
elsewhere. (See index, i 

ASPARAGUS SOUPS. 

Take some nicely toasted bread that has been toasted or 
browned clear through, and moisten by dipping into a dish 
of hot water and removing at once. Place on the dish on 
which it is to be served, and spread over the top a few 
spoonfuls of the asparagus with egg gravy. Serve hot. (See 
index for directions for egg gravy.) 



EGGPLANT. 

BAKED EGGPLANT NO \. 

Cut in slices one third of an inch thick without removing the 
skins. Soak in cold, salted water for an hour or more, drain, and 
dip each slice in white flour, then in a beaten egg, and lastly 
into finely grated zwieback. Place on well-oiled tins, and bake 
in a moderate oven until they are very tender. Serve hot. 
They may be served with an egg gravy if desired. 

BAKED EGGPLANT NO. 2. 

Peel, slice, and salt the eggplant, letting it stand in the 
salt for an hour or more. Mix together 4 tablespoonfuls of 
flour, the yolk of i raw egg, i tablespoonful of peanut oil or 
nutcoa, and salt. In another bowl, beat the white of an egg 
to a stiff froth, and put into the batter. Dry the slices of 



264 GL'IUK FOR NUT COOKERY. 

eggplant on a clean cloth, dip them in the batter, and place 
on well-oiled tins. Bake in a moderate oven until tender. 



STUFFED EGGPLANT. 

Parboil in hot water for fifteen or twenty minutes, accord- 
ing to size. Make a hole in one side, and take out the seeds. 
Lay it in enough ice-cold, salted water to cover it, and let 
stand for one hour; then stuff it with a paste made of bread- 
crumbs, grated nutrneato, a little minced parsley, and a little 
salt. When stuffed, cover the hole with an oiled paper, and 
place that side down in an oiled pudding dish. Add a little 
water, and bake in the oven. Baste occasionally with the 
water in the dish, and when it can be easily pierced with a 
straw, it is done. Take up the eggplant, roll it in beaten egg, 
and then in finely grated zwieback. Return to the oven 
again, and let brown. Serve sliced crosswise. 

ESCALLOPED EGGPLANT. 

Peel the eggplant, slice one fourth of an inch thick, salt, 
and let stand in a bowl for one hour; then wash off the salt 
and put it in a granite or porcelain-lined kettle, and let it 
boil until tender ; if boiled in iron or tin it is likely to be 
dark. Place a layer in an oiled pudding dish. Have ready 
some stale bread which has been soaking in cold water for 
an hour, pour off all the water possible, and add to it i cup 
of strained tomatoes, 2 tablespoonfuls of nutcoa or peanut 
or almond oil, and a little salt. Put a layer of this on the 
eggplant, then another layer of eggplant, and so on, placing 
on the top a layer of grated xwieback, sprinkled over with 
a little grated nutmeato. Place in a moderate oven, and 
bake a nice brown.

BEETS. 

Beets contain considerable sugar. The variety known as 
" sugar beet " is cultivated in many countries for the manu- 
facture of sugar. This industry is being introduced into this 
country. The beet is more nutritious than many other 
vegetables, but requires a long time for digestion-- about four 
hours. For this reason it can not be eaten by many who 
have weak stomachs. They have a total nutritive value of 
twelve per cent. 

BOILED BEETS. 

Select fresh and tender beets, because withered or shriveled 
ones will never cook tender. Scrub them with a vegetable 
brush to remove all dirt, but be careful not to break off any 
of the rootlets, as that will cause them to bleed and lose their 
sweet flavor. Put into boiling water, and cook until tender, 
which can be ascertained by pressing upon the beet. Piercing 
with a fork will cause them to bleed. When done, rub off 
the skins, and slice while hot. Pour over them equal parts 
of lemon-juice and water. Let them stand several hours 
before using. 

CHOPPED BEETS. 

Cook as for boiled beets. Peel, chop fine, and pour over 
them a dressing made of lemon-juice and almond cream. 
Sugar may be added if desired. 

BAKED BEETS. 

Cook as in the preceding recipe; when tender, cut into 
dice, place a layer in a pudding dish, and sprinkle with 
bread-crumbs; then add another layer of beets, covering with 



26C GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

the bread-crumbs on the top. Pour over the whole enough 
salted, strained tomatoes to moisten well, and bake in a quick 
oven until brown on top. If desired, a plain nut cream may 
be used instead of the tomatoes. 

BEET GREENS. 

Take one peck of young beets, use the leaves and small 
beets, but reject the stocks, as they will be tough. Wash 
thoroughly, and cook until very tender; then drain, pressing 
out all the water possible; add salt to taste and 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of thick raw peanut cream. Let it stew for a few min- 
utes; then chop quite fine with a sharp knife, and serve hot. 

SPINACH ON TOAST. 

Take 6 slices of bread of the same size and thickness, and 
cut a diamond out of each slice that is five inches the longer 
way from point to point, and three inches across from one 
oblique angle to the other; six of them will make a perfect 
circle. A nice way to cut a diamond any size you wish is to 
take a double string, put a lead-pencil point in the loop, and 
allow as much string as you want the length of the diamond 
from the obtuse to the acute angle. Then holding the string 
fast at one point in the center of a good-sized piece of paper, 
move the lead-pencil round so as to draw a circle, having the 
length of the string for the radius of the circle; make a dot at 
any part of the circle, hold the end of the string upon it, and 
with the lead-pencil in the loop, draw a mark across the circle; 
that is, the distance from the first mark in the circle to the 
second mark drawn in the circle will be just the length of the 
radius, and will also be just one sixth of the circle. Then 
draw a line from each point in the circle to the center, and 
with the shears cut upon these lines. Fold the paper from

one point to the other, v.iiich will be one half of the diamond. 
To make the other half, press it down, and cut the paper just 
the same size as the first half. Then place the paper diamond 
upon the slice of bread, and with a very sharp knife cut it 
like the pattern. Toast these upon a soapstone on top of 
the stove, to a very nice brown; they may be toasted in 
the oven, but the stone gives them more of a fried appear- 
ance and taste. Place them on a platter (a round one is 




SPINACH ON TOAST. 

preferred) in such a way that they will form a star with 
six points. Have ready i peck of spinach which has been 
very thoroughly washed in several waters to remove all the 
sand and dirt. When boiled until perfectly tender, drain off 
all the water possible, and add i teaspoonful of nut butter 
dissolved in a little cool water, and the yolk of i egg. Beat 
the egg, add the diluted butter and salt, and mix very 
thoroughly with the greens, chopping them with a knife; 
put them into a basin that is about six inches across, so 
as to press them into a round shape. When placed upon 



268 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

the toast, it should not cover the points of the toast. 
When it is cold enough to be solid, turn it out upon the 
toast, and garnish with the whites of boiled eggs chopped 
fine placed upon the top, with the chopped yolks in the cen- 
ter, and garnished with sections of lemon cut lengthwise. 
The cut will give an idea of how it is made. It is not very 
much work to make it, and it is not necessary to cut the 
bread into diamonds unless a fancy dish is desired. Slices 
of bread may be cut diagonally so as to make an acute 
b point, as in the accompanying cut. Let a, />, 
c, d represent a slice of bread ; cut it from 
the corner a to c. Then arrange on the plate 
so that the points will stand out. Place the 
plate in the oven to warm just before serving, 
and serve each individual with a piece of toast 
with some of the spinach on it and one or two 
pieces of lemon. 

DANDELION GREENS. 

Take i peck of fresh dandelions, look over and wash well, 
and put on the stove in plenty of cold water. AYhen they 
have boiled for a few minutes, drain off the water, and 
add more. If they are not real young, they will need par- 
boiling again. Then cook until very tender, add i table- 
spoonful of salt, and cook for ten minutes. Drain, and 
press out all the water possible, add 2 tablespoonfuls of 
raw peanut cream, more salt if it is needed, and lastly stir 
in the well-beaten yolk of i egg. Remove from the stove, 
and serve at once. Other greens, as horseradish, mustard, 
etc., may also be seasoned in the same way, adding lemon- 
juice if desired. These are nice if served on toast the same 
as Spinach on Toast. 



VEGETABLES. 269 

RADISHES. 

Radishes do not contain very much nutriment, being about 
the same in composition as the turnip, but their bright color 
adds to the beauty of the table, and if well masticated they 
can be digested by a normal stomach. 

COOKED RADISHES. 

Select crisp, fresh radishes, slice, and cook until tender. 
Salt to taste, then pour over them a ceam gravy made of 
water, peanut or almond butter, and thickened with a little 
white flour. 

BAKED RADISHES. 

Cook like the above until tender, then to 3 cups of 
cooked radishes add i cup of coarsely ground peanuts, \ 
cup of zwieola, and water to moisten. Bake in the oven 
until brown. 



CABBAGE. 

Cabbage is very low in nutritive value, and not very easy 
of digestion. It consists principally of water. The winter 
cabbage contains eighty per cent, water, four per cent, 
albuminous elements, one per cent, sugar, one per cent, fat, 
ten per cent, pectose, and the remainder of cellulose, or 
woody matter. 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

Select a good, solid head, remove the withered leaves, and 
shave fine, rejecting the heart. Put to boil in boiling water, 
and cook rapidly until tender; then add salt, and let stew for

ten minutes. If there is much water, drain it off, and add 
enough almond or peanut cream to season well; serve hot. 
The juice of one lemon may be added if desired. 

BAKED CABBAGE. 

Cook finely sliced or chopped cabbage in boiling water 
until very tender, and until nearly all the water has evap- 
orated, which will take about two hours. Then let it cool. 
To i pint of cooked cabbage, add 2 well-beaten eggs, salt to 
taste, and \ cup of thin nut cream, made by dissolving i 
teaspoonful of almond butter in \ cup of water. Raw pea- 
nut butter may be used, but the roasted butter does not 
blend with cabbage as well as with some of the vegetables. 
Pour this over the cabbage, mix, and bake in a moder- 
ate oven. 

CHOPPED CABBAGE NO. J. 

Select fresh, solid heads, and chop them fine, after the 
outer withered leaves and heart have been removed. Then 
prepare the following sauce: For i pint of chopped cabbage, 
take the yolk of i egg, 2 teaspoonfuls of sugar, i tablespoon- 
ful of nut cream, ^ teaspoonful of salt, the juice and a little

Take a large, solid head of cabbage, and remove the 
heart; then fill the vacancy with a stuffing made of plain 
nutmeatose (that is, without sage), bread-crumbs, and the 
yolk of I egg. When the cavities are filled, place the 
two halves together, and tie firmly, or better still, sew up 
in a clean white cloth, and boil in a kettle or steam in a 
steam-cooker for two hours. Serve hot. 

BAKED CAULIFLOWER. 

Trim off the leaves of a firm head of cauliflower, and 
let stand in salted water one hour. If there are any in- 
sects, they will crawl out. Cook in slightly salted water 
until tender, then drain carefully, re-move from the stock, 
and place in a pudding dish in which it may be served. 
After this has been done, make a sauce of nut cream (al- 
mond or raw peanut preferred) thickened with a little white 
flour and salt to taste. A little grated nutmeato may be 
added if desired. Pour over the cauliflower, then sprinkle 
well with bread-crumbs, and bake in the oven for ten min- 
utes. Remove the cover, and let brown. Serve at once, 
or it may be kept in a cool place and reheated for Sab- 
bath dinner.

ONIONS. 

The principal use to which onions are generally put is 
to season soups, gravies, and other foods. They contain a 
volatile oil that is not digestible, but this evaporates with the 
cooking. For this reason, onions should never be eaten 
paw. The total nutritive value of the onion is thirteen per 
cent. It contains one and seven-tenths per cent, of albu- 
minous elements, two and eight-tenths of sugar, one of fat, 
seven of salt, and eight of carbonaceous elements. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Select good white onions of medium size. Peel and 
soak in cold water for one or two hours, then put on in cold 
water, let boil about five or ten minutes, and drain. Then 
cover with boiling water, and let cook for two or three 
hours or until very tender. Salt should be added a half- 
hour before done to let it penetrate. Flavor with nut but- 
ter, either almond or raw peanut, or a thin nut gravy may 
be used instead. If the gravy is used, it should be thick- 
ened with white flour. 

The reason why they should be soaked in water and par- 
boiled is to remove the acrid oil, or strong taste, of the onion, 
which is irritating to the stomach. Onions should be 
thoroughly cooked; they should not be eaten raw. 

ESCALLOPED ONIONS. 

Cook as directed for stewed onions. When tender, cut 
in halves and place in a pudding dish. Then to one pint 
of nut milk take 2 level tablespoonfuls of zwieola and i well- 
beaten egg; salt to taste. Mix well; pour over the onions, 
and bake. 



VEGETABLES. 2/3 

BAKED ONIONS. 

Peel and boil the onions as in previous recipes, being 
careful not to boil them to pieces. While slightly rare, cut 
in halves and take out the centers. Place them in a pud- 
ding dish with the cup side up, and fill the cups with a 
stuffing made as follows : i egg, i tablespoonful of nut cream, 
i tablespoonful of grated nutmeato, and salt and thyme to 
taste. Mix with enough bread-crumbs to make of the right 
consistency. Moisten the whole with a little nut cream, and 
bake in a quick oven. 



LETTUCE. 

This vegetable, though not very nutritious, is digestible 
unless the dressing with which it is served is unwholesome. 
The practise of serving lettuce with vinegar is not to be coun- 
tenanced by those who wish to be hygienic, as the effect of 
vinegar upon the digestive organs is very bad. It hinders the 
digestion of starch, irritates the stomach, and causes the 
starch to ferment. When lettuce is served with a simple and 
healthful dressing, it is not objectionable. 

LETTUCE WITH CREAM. 

Take very tender lettuce that is perfectly fresh, wash well, 
and tear the leaves into small pieces. Put into a dish and 
pour over it the following : i cup of cold water, i teaspoon- 
ful of peanut butter, i tablespoonful of sugar, and j tea- 
spoonful of vanilla or any seasoning desired. Dissolve the 
butter in the water, adding only a little at a time. - Then add 
the sugar and vanilla. Serve cold.

.274 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

LETTUCE SALAD. 

Select tender, crisp lettuce, tear into pieces, and place on 
a plate or a shallow platter. Pour over the lettuce a dress- 
ing made as follows : 2 tablespoonfuls of nut butter rubbed 
smooth in g- cup of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, i 
teaspoonful of sugar, and .\ teaspoonful of salt. Boil together 
a moment, and cool. 



CELERY. 

CELERY WITH GRAVY. 

Take very brittle celery, wash well, cut in one-half finger 
lengths, and cook until very tender. Then drain, saving the 
water in which it was cooked, and adding enough to it to 
make a cream sauce as follows : To i pint of water dissolve 
i tablespoonful of almond butter or 2 tablespoonfuls of raw 
peanut cream, and when boiling, thicken with i teaspoonful of 
white flour ; salt to taste. Pour over the cooked celery and 
serve hot. A beaten egg may be added if desired. 

TO USE COLD COOKED CELERY. 

When any cooked potatoes and celery is left over from a 
dinner, a very palatable dish may be made by chopping the 
potatoes and cutting the celery up quite fine. Mix thoroughly, 
and warm in the steamer, or double boiler. 

CURLED CELERY. 

Select nice tender celery, clean well, and cut off the stems 
where they begin to branch for the leaves. Slice the stock 
in three or four slits to near the center from both ends, leav- 



VEGETABLES. 275 

ing a piece that is whole in the center about one to two inches 
long. Place them in ice-water, and in twenty minutes the 
slices of stocks will be curled nicely. Serve them stacked 
upon a celery tray. In eating, the little curls are to be broken 
off with the fingers. 



SQUASH. 

SUMMER SQUASH. 

Summer squash is very low in nutritive value, but is easily 
digested, and if properly cooked is palatable, and helps to 
make a variety. The crook-neck are the nicest flavored, but 
the hardest to prepare, on account of the seeds. 

SUMMER SQUASH WITH EGG SAUCE. 

Prepare and steam until tender, then cut into small 
pieces, and serve with egg sauce, (For directions for making 
sauce, see index.) 

WINTER SQUASH. 

The winter squash is more nutritious than the summer 
squash, having a total nutritive value of eighty-five per cent. 
When well ripened, they are very mealy and sweet. The 
Hubbard is considered the best variety, but the Marblehead 
and some others are very good. To test their ripeness, 
stick the thumb-nail into the shell, and if it goes in easily, 
the squash is green. A ripe squash is too hard to be pierced 
with the nail. 

STEAMED SQUASH. 

Select a good, ripe, Hubbard squash. (They are ripe when 
the shell is so hard that it is difficult to pierce with the 
thumb-nail.) Wash, and cut into convenient pieces, remove 



2/6 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

the seeds, and pare away the stringy portion next to the seed 
cavity, but leave the shell on. Place in a steamer or a steam- 
cooker, and cook until it can be pierced to the shell easily with 
a fork. Then scrape from the shell, and mash or press 
through a vegetable press. Season with salt and nut cream. 
Place in a baking dish, and bake a nice brown on top. 

BAKED SQUASH. 

Prepare as for steamed squash, and place in an oven and 
bake until very tender. They can be served in the shell un- 
seasoned, or scraped from the shell and seasoned with salt 
and nut cream before serving. In the fall of the year 
squash is better steamed, as they are apt to be too dry and 
mealy when baked; but in the winter and spring, they are 
better baked. 



CUCUMBERS. 

The cucumber is very low in nutritive value, having only 
four per cent, of nutrition. It is not, however, objectionable 
unless served with vinegar, pepper, and other condiments. It 
is more easily digested if cooked before serving. 

CUCUMBER SALAD. 

Take fresh cucumbers of the right size for table use, and 
place in very cold water for one hour before using. When 
ready to use, pare, slice, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Serve 
at once 

ESCALLOPED CUCUMBERS. 

Take four cucumbers (right size for table use), slice, and 
cook in boiling water until tender. Press through a colander 
or sieve. Add a sufficient amount of white bread-crumbs to

make about the consistency of pudding. Add a pinch of salt, 
a teaspoonful of raw peanut butter dissolved in 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of water, and i well-beaten egg. Pour into a pudding 
dish, and bake until the custard is set, but not browned 
or dry. 



TOMATOES. 

The tomato consists principally of water, and hence is 
very low in nutritive value. As late as the early part of 
this century, the tomato was regarded as poisonous, and 
some now have an idea that they cause cancers. This, 
however, is not the case. It being an acid fruit or vege- 
table, it is excellent served as a relish, and is serviceable 
in making soups and salads, as well as a variety of mixed 
dishes. 

SLICED TOMATOES. 

They should be prepared a half-hour before serving. 
Select good, ripe, sound, tomatoes that are perfectly fresh 
and tender. Peel them very thin without scalding them. 
Slice and put in a refrigerator or in a cool place. Serve as 
a relish, and let each individual season to suit himself. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Pour hot water over the tomatoes, and let them stand 
for one minute, and then plunge them into cold water. 
Peel and slice and put into a granite dish which has been 
oiled with peanut oil. Let them cook until perfectly tender, 
stirring and chopping them with a silver spoon. They will 
not need any water if they are stirred often, as they con- 
tain so much water themselves. Salt may be added if 
desired. Serve hot in a deep dish lined with slices of toast. 



2/8 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



ESCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Take i quart of stewed and sifted tomatoes, and add 
to them 2\ cups of bread-crumbs, or better still, zwieback 
rolled fine with a rolling pin. Add i cup of nut cream, and 
salt to taste. Mix well and bake for twenty minutes. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Select good, solid, ripe tomatoes. Wash well and slice 
crosswise without peeling. Season with salt and sugar if 
desired, and dip each slice in white flour, then into a beaten 
egg, then in finely grated bread-crumbs made from white 
zwieback. Place on an oiled tin, and bake until a nice 
brown. Serve hot. 

STUFFED TOMATOES NO. I. 

Take 6 good-sized ripe tomatoes, but not those that are 
too soft. Wash well, remove the stern, cut a small, round 
hole in the top, and remove the seeds, then fill the cavities 
with the following: 

Take i cup of nutmeato grated very fine, and A cup of 
pulverized white zwieback, made fine with a rolling-pin on 
bread-board. Salt to taste, and add a little chopped parsley 
or celery salt if desired. Mix well together and fill the to- 
matoes. Place stern end down on a graniteware pic-tin, or 
in a pudding dish, and bake thirty minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

STUFFED TOMATOES NO 2. 

Select 12 (or any number desired) solid, smooth, ripe 
tomatoes, and cut a slice off the blossom end of each, and 
with a spoon remove the center part of <:he pulp with the

seeds, leaving the shell unbroken. Select a solid head of 
cabbage (not very large i and i onion; boil together until 
tender, which will take one hour or more. Chop fine, and 
add finely grated bread-crumbs and the pulp of the tomato, 
rejecting the seeds. Add I cup of nut cream. Season with 
salt and sugar to taste. Fill the tomatoes, placing the slice 
back in its place, and lay the tomatoes, stem end down, in a

pudding dish. Pour in a little water to keep from burn- 
ing, and bake for a half-hour, or until thoroughly done. 
Serve hot. 

BAKED TOMATO. 

Take 6 medium-ripe tomatoes of equal size. Cut a piece 
from the blow end, and remove the seed cavity with the flesh 
that is in the center, leaving the flesh next to the skin, then 
sift the tomato that is taken out, removing all the seeds, and 



28O GUIDE FOR NTT COOKERY. 

add a small teaspoonlul of peanut butter to each tomato, 
also one tablespoonful of zwieola or bread-crumbs, and salt to 
taste. Bake in a quick oven until lightly browned, and serve 
on individual dishes on lettuce leaves. 

DRIED TOMATOES. 

Take' good, ripe tomatoes, but not too ripe, as they will 
be too juicy. Peel very thin without scalding, and slice 
crosswise about one fourth of an inch thick. Place a layer of 
them on a plate or a granite pie-tin, then sprinkle with sugar, 
and put in a warm place to dry. When thoroughly dried, 
put in a paper bag in a cool place for winter. They may be 
used instead of raisins for puddings and cakes. 

CANNED TOMATOES. 

Select good, solid, ripe tomatoes. They must not be over- 
ripe or specked ; for if they are, they will not be apt to 
keep well ; indeed, this is the very cause of so many having 
trouble in keeping canned tomatoes. Scald with boiling water 
for one minute and peel. Slice crosswise about one-half inch 
thick, and if the tomatoes are very large, they must be halved 
or quartered to get into the can. Put in a clean, well steril- 
ized can, shake down well, and put on the cover tight. Place 
in a steam-cooker (or a wash boiler will do, with some straw, 
or four or five thicknesses of cloth on the bottom to keep the 
cans from breaking ; but a rack made of narrow slats to fit 
ilu; boiler on purpose for canning fruit, is much better and 
\ery much less work). When the water has boiled fifteen or 
twenty minutes, remove the cans one at a time. Take off 
the cover, put on the rubber, and fill the can with some boil- 
ing tomatoes, which are ready in a stew-kettle, or one can 
may be taken to fill up the others with. Put on the cover, 



VEGETABLES. -< s l 

screw down tight, and place on a table or shelf out of the 
draft, standing the cans bottom side up on their covers. 
When cold, turn over, tighten the covers as much as possi- 
ble, and place in a dark, cool cellar. 



GREEN CORN. 

Green corn does not contain the nutriment that the 
mature grain does, and is therefore more commonly classed 
with the vegetables. The same may be said of green peas 
and beans. They make many palatable and healthful dishes. 

GREEN CORN ON THE COB. 

Select fresh corn, as that which has been standing for 
even a day has lost much of its sweetness. Corn is right for 
use when the milk has begun to thicken, but not enough to 
harden the skin or hull. Remove the husks and silks, and 
steam in a steam-cooker or a common steamer over a kettle 
of boiling water for twenty or thirty minutes, according to 
the size of the kernels and the age of the corn. The corn 
that is left from dinner may be cut from the cob and used 
the next day in macaroni cornlet; or it may be put with an 
equal quantity of chopped potatoes moistened with a little 
nut cream and a well-beaten egg. Drop a tablespoonful at 
a time on oiled tins and bake in the oven. 

STEWED CORN. 

Select tender, fresh corn, and remove all husks and 
silks. With a sharp knife cut the center of each row of 
kernels, and with the back of the knife press out the kernels, 
leaving the hulls on the cob. To i quart of this add I cup of 



282 (IL'IDK FOR NUT COOKERY. 

almond milk or raw peanut milk, and cook in a double boiler 
for one hour or more. Cooking will not hurt it. When done, 
season with salt, and if too thick, add more nut milk. A 
well-beatrn egg may be stirred in if desired just a moment 
before taking up. 

BAKED CORN OYSTERS. 

Prepare the corn and scrape from the cob as in the 
recipe above; then add \ cup white flour, .\ cup nut meal, 
and salt to taste. Mix well, put on oiled tins in drops about 
the size of an oyster, and bake a light brown. 

BAKED CORN NO. J. 

Select fresh, tender, sweet corn; husk and silk. With a 
sharp knife run it down the rows, cutting the kernels in 
the middle. Then with the back of the knife, scrape 
down, and the kernels will jump out of their hulls, leaving 
the hulls on the cob. Add I cup of hot water, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of zwieola, and salt to taste. Bake in a moderate oven 
three fourths of an hour. A little raw peanut butter may be 
added if desired. 

BAKED CORN NO. 2, 

Take as many ears of good, tender, fresh green corn as is 
desired for one meal, and remove the husks and silks; then oil 
them with peanut oil or nutcoa. Sprinkle with salt and 
place in a dripping-pan. Bake in a very hot oven until they 
are quite brown. Serve hot. 

SUCCOTASH. 

The common shelled beans may be used for this purpose, 
but the Lima shelled beans are preferable. Shell, wash, and 
boil. About twenty minutes before serving, add an equal 



VEGETABLES. 283 

amount of sweet corn cut from the cob. Be careful not to cut 
it too close. Season with salt and raw peanut cream, and 
serve hot. 

TO CAN CORN. 

Choose good, tender sweet corn. It should not be any 
riper for canning than for table use. Cut the center of each 
row of kernels, and with the back of the knife scrape out all 
the pulp and chits, leaving only the hulls on the cob, then 
without cooking, pack it in glass jars until they are full; put 
on the rubber and cover, and screw down tight. Do not 
remove the cover after it is once on. Cook in a steam-cooker 
if you have one, if not, put some lath in the bottom of the 
boiler, put in your cans, and put some cloths between the 
cans, so that they will not touch each other, else when boil- 
ing, they may strike together and break. Pour in enough 
cold water -to half cover the jars, and place on the stove. 
Cover with a tight-fitting cover and boil for four or five hours; 
then remove the cans and tighten the covers if you can; let 
cool; when cold, tighten the covers as much as you can, and 
set in a dark, cool cellar. 

DRIED CORN. 

Select good, tender sweet corn, no riper than for table 
use. Husk, and be sure to silk well; then cut the center of 
each row of kernels, and with back of the knife scrape out all 
but the hull. Place on plates or granite pie-tins, and dry in 
a warm oven or near the stove. Corn dried in the sun loses 
its flavor and sweetness, besides being exposed to flies and 
dust. The usual method of cutting the kernels from the 
cob is not so good, as the hulls are left on, and are irrita- 
ting to a weak stomach. When thoroughly dry, put in a 
good paper bag and store in a cool, dry room. 



284 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

TO COOK DRIED CORN. 

Look over and soak all night or for several hours before 
cooking, then cook in the same water in which it was soaked. 
Stew it slowly, and when tender, season with salt and raw 
peanut or almond cream. One third as much strained toma- 
toes may be added if it suits the family. Dried corn is also 
excellent ground through a grain mill and used in soups and 
other dishes. 

SWEET-CORN WITH COCOANUT MILK. 

Take I can of good corn and put in the inner part of a 
double boiler, add i cup of cocoanut milk and a little salt ; 
place in the outer part of the double boiler, the water in 
which should be boiling, and cook for half an hour. Serve 
hot. This is certainly a very delicious dish. 

CORN PEPPER. 

Take some white field corn (the yellow will do if the other 
can not be obtained), and roast it in the oven or peanut roaster 
until it is nicely brownrd. Then grind through a coffee-mill, 
and use to sprinkle over foods which you wish to have a fine 
appearance, and bake in the oven. It may also be used in 
gravy, on eggs, and the like. 

CAPPED CORN. 

Take good, tender sweet corn, and with a sharp knife cut 
the skins, only, from the top of the kernels, leaving the 
remainder on the cob ; salt the ears of corn and then spread 
them with nut butter made from pine-nuts, which may be 
diluted a little to make it more easy to spread ; then put on 
bake tins and bake in a moderate oven until nicely browned. 
Serve very hot. Almond butter or raw peanut cream may be 
used instead of the pine-nut if more convenient 



VEGETABLES. 285 

GREEN PEAS AND BEANS. 

The pea and bean in the mature state belong to the 
Legume family, but in their unripe condition are usually 
classed with the vegetable. In this state, they are not very 
nutritious, but make palatable and healthful dishes for sum- 
mer, when so great a quantity of heat-producing elements are 
not required. 

STRING-BEANS. 

String well, break into inch lengths, wash thoroughly, and 
cook in boiling water until tender (this usually takes about 
two hours). Salt the water about ten minutes before they 
are done, then drain thoroughly, and make a gravy of almond 
or raw peanut milk thickened with a little white flour; salt 
slightly and pour on the beans. Let boil up once and serve. 
If preferred, the flour may be omitted. 

STRING-BEANS WITH EGG. 

Boil in salted water with a bunch of savory or parsley 
leaves; drain, and put them in a stew-pan with 5 tablespoon- 
fuls of raw peanut cream, the yolks of 3 eggs, and a little 
salt. Stir it constantly until of a proper thickness. A little 
grated onion may be added with the beans if desired. 

TO CAN STRING-BEANS. 

Wash thoroughly, string, and cut in inch lengths. Pack 
as tightly as possible in the cins, then fill each can with 
water. Tin cans are best for them, but glass cans may be 
used. If the tin cans are' used, they should be thoroughly 
washed and rinsed in boiling water before the beans are put 
in. After they are filled with beans and water, place on the 



286 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

cover and solder them. Now put in a steam-cooker or a 
wash-boiler, cover with water, and boil for four or five hours. 
If glass cans are used, they should be new ones, or if they 
have been used before, they should be sterili/ed by boiling in 
Milted water for one hour. The rubbers should be new. Fill 
the same as the tin cans, put on the rubber, screw down the 
covers tight, cook in a steam-cooker for four or five hours, or 
e.iokin a wash-boiler by putting four or five thicknesses of 
cloth in the boiler. Wrap each can with a cloth to prevent 
breaking. 

SHELLED BEANS. 

The lima beans are considered the best, but other varie- 
ties are good. Cook in boiling, salted water until they are 
very tender. Season with nut milk and serve hot. 

TO WARM UP SHELLED BEANS. 

Pour off all the milk, sift through a colander, and mix 
with an equal quantity of cold mashed potatoes; add i well- 
beaten egg. Make into small cakes with the hands; place on 
well-oiled tins and bake in the oven. A little thick nut cream 
may be added if desired. 

BOILED GREEN PEAS. 

Select good, sweet peas, shell and wash thoroughly, and 
boil in hot water until tender. About ten minutes before 
they are done, add salt to taste; then drain and pour over 
them thin raw peanut milk which has been cooked. Let 
boil up once and serve. If desired, it may be thickened with 
a little white flour.

Pour in a pudding dish, and bike in the oven until of a nice 
brown on top. 

GREEN PEAS WITH EGG. 

Cook the peas until tender. Rub through a colander, and 
add a little minced celery or parsley, and salt to taste. To i

SOUPS. 



SOUPS are not so nutritious, of course, as more solid foods, 
as they contain so much water; but they are useful at 
the beginning of the meal, to start the flow of the digestive 
llu ids. One is not so apt to overeat when eating soups, as 
the water of the soup is so soon absorbed and passes into the 
s\ stem. 

PLAIN DUMPLINGS. 

Take ^ cup of walnut meal, \ cup of grated zwieback, salt 
to taste, .', cup of Hour, and \ cup of cold water. Mix well; 
form into dumplings as large as a marble. Cook in the soup 
and serve with it. 

NUTMEATOSE BALLS. 

Put \ cup of nut cream over the fire; when boiling, stir in 
quickly j cup of flour and stir for a minute. Then remove 
from the stove and let cool; add i well-beaten egg and 2 
tablespoonfuls of grated nutmeatose. Fold in lightly. Drop 
this paste on well-oiled tins, in pieces not larger than a small 
hickory-nut, and bake. Serve in soup. 

LA ROYAL, SERVED IN SOUPS, 

Take 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of thin nut cream, and a 

little salt. Beat the eggs until well mixed. Add the salt and 

nut cream, and turn into a small basin, well oiled; place in a 

pan of boiling water, and set in the oven or on top of the 

[290] 



sours. 291 

stove until the custard is set. When cold, cut into blocks or 
fancy shapes. Put into the tureen and turn over them the 
soup. A little grated nutmeg may be added to the custard 
if desired. 

EGG BALLS. 

Boil 4 eggs long enough to have the yolks dry and mealy. 
Put into cold water, then mash both whites and yolks through 
a fine sieve, and add the yolk of I raw egg, I teaspoonful 
of flour, and salt and parsley to taste. Make into balls and 
boil four or five minutes. 

WALNUT BALLS FOR SOUPS. 

Mix ^ cup of bread-crumbs, the yolks of 4 hard-boiled 
eggs, and ^ cup of walnut meats ground coarse through 
the mill, or they can be chopped or pounded. Season with 
salt and bind together with 2 tablespoonfuls of nut milk. 
Make into balls the size of a hickory-nut, and cook in the 
soup for twenty minutes, then serve with the soup, hot. 

HYGIENIC DUMPLINGS. 

Put i quart of nut milk into a kettle; when boiling, add j 
teaspoonful of salt, and stir in enough flour to make it quite 
stiff, like hasty pudding. It is nice to whip it in with a batter 
whip. Remove from the stove to let cool. While it is cool- 
ing, separate the whites from the yolks of 3 eggs and beat 
each separately, and then add the beaten yolk to the pud- 
ding, and lastly fold in lightly the well-beaten whites. Dip 
up a spoonful and drop it in a saucer of flour, rolling it over 
to get it all covered, and then drop it in the soup, which 
should be in the inner cup of a double boiler. Continue this 
until all the dumplings are in; then cover, and cook twenty 



2 9 2 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

minutes. The reason for cooking them in a double boiler is 
to keep them at the same temperature of heat and not boil. 
They can be cooked in an ordinary kettle, but the kettle 
must be set on the back part of the stove, where it will keep 
just below the boiling-point. Serve at once. Dumplings 
are spoiled if they have to stand. 

ZWIEOLA DUMPLINGS. 

Take 2 cups of nut milk and heat it to boiling, add | tea- 
spoonful of salt, and then stir in i cup of zwieola and I cup 
of white flour, adding the zwieola first and then the white 
flour. Remove from the stove, and when cool, fold in the 
yolks of 2 eggs beaten to a thick cream, and lastly fold in the 
stiffly beaten whites, drop in tablespoonfuls into boiling hot 
soup, and cook in a double boiler for half an hour. They can 
be cooked in an ordinary kettle, but it must be set on the top 
of the stove in a place where it will not boil after the dump- 
lings have been added, or they will boil to pieces. They 
may be cooked in any soup, but a nut-broth soup or a raw 
peanut milk soup is especially nice for dumplings. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 

Beat i egg, add a little salt, and as much flour as it will 
take up. Roll as thin as brown paper, sprinkle very lightly 
with flour, roll up into a large roll, and slice from the ends, 
into narrow strips. Shake out the strips lightly and drop 
into the soup.

a fine wire sieve (coffee strainer), and serve in hot cups. This 
is rich, and has the taste of beef broth. It is also very good as 
a stock for nearly all kinds of soup. 

BOUILLON NO. 2. 

Take some pine-nuts, wash and salt slightly, about i tea- 
spoonful to i cup of nuts, putting the nuts in a pie-tin, and 
sprinkling the salt over them. Place in the oven and toast to 
a medium brown, but do not burn them; pour into a plate or 
pie-tin, and mash with a cup or tumbler, rolling them as with 
a rolling-pin. They are very tender, and can be crushed be- 
tween the fingers. Take one tablespoonful of the crushed 
pine-nuts to one pint of water, and cook for one hour, simmer- 
ing gently. Salt to taste and strain through a fine sieve. 
Serve hot in hot cups. 

Bouillon is to be served instead of soup with luncheon 
or with a very hearty dinner where the entrees are 
elaborate. 

BOUILLON NO. 3. 

Slice the kernels of Brazil-nuts and place them on a tin in 
the oven to brown a nice straw color. When cold, grind 
them, or they can be easily pulverized by rolling on a platter 
with a glass bottle. A wooden cake board and rolling-pin 
absorbs so much of the oil, it is not a good thing to use. 
But if one has a marble slab and a glass rolling-pin, the nuts 
can be pulverized very quickly and easily. When real fine, 
use i tablespoonful for i cup of bouillon. Let it simmer for 
half an hour or longer. Strain through a coffee strainer. 
Salt to suit the taste, and serve very hot, in cups. 



294 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

BOUILLON NO. 4. 

Crack some butternuts on the end, and pick out as whole 
as possible. Place on a tin, and bake in a moderate oven 
until the inside of the kernels are a dark straw color; then set 
in a cool but dry place. When perfectly cold, the skins will 
be loose, and can be easily blanched by rubbing between 
thumb and finger. Grind or pulverize, and stew gently about 
i teaspoonful for i cup of broth. 

BOUILLON NO. 5. 

Take English walnuts and toast them the same as the 
butternuts in the preceding recipe. When blanched and 
pulverized, use i teaspoonful for i cup of broth, stew 
^riitly a half-hour or longer. Strain through a coffee 
strainer, and salt to suit the taste. Serve very hot. 

Pecans, hickory-nuts, or hazelnuts may be used in the 
same way. 

SOUP STOCK. 

The bouillon made from any of the nuts makes an excel- 
lent stock for soups, and those accustomed to using soup stock 
made from meat, will immediately think it an improvement 
to many of the soups. The bouillon with vermicelli, maca- 
roni, or rice makes a very nice soup with only the addition 
of salt. 

ALMOND SOUP NO. J. 

Take i pound of almond meal or butter, i teaspoonful of 
sugar, one tablespoonful of corn-starch, i quart of hot water, 
and a pinch of salt. First blanch, dry, and grind the almonds

it can be kept smooth ; place in a double boiler and cook for 
one hour. If too thick, it can be thinned with water or nut 
milk made of almonds. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

Take 2 bunches of tender asparagus, cut into pieces, 
put into boiling water, and let simmer until perfectly tender.

hard pieces through the colander. Flavor with salt and nut 
butter (almond butter or raw peanut cream preferred). Re- 
heat and serve with toasted bread or crackers. 

DRIED BEAN SOUP. 

Look over and wash I quart of dry beans and put to soak 
in cold water overnight. The next morning put them in the 
soup kettle with 4 quarts of cold water, add i grated onion, 
peel and slice i turnip and I carrot and add with the rest. 
Boil these ingredients very slowly for three hours, or until 
they are tender enough to rub through a sieve. Then return

water. When tender, rub through a colander, then return to 
the stove. Season with salt and raw peanut cream to suit 
the taste, and thicken by adding finely grated zwieback. 

BEET SOUP. 

Boil ^ small beets. Let them get cold and grate them. 
Add i quart of nut milk, part nut cream if desired. Heat to 
boiling, and salt and thicken with a little white flour. I cup 
of raw peanut cream and 3 cups of water make a nice milk 
for this soup. 



SOUPS. 297 

CARROT SOUP. 

Slice i onion, place on an oiled tin, and bake in the oven 
until of a rich brown color. Place in a stew-pan, add to 
them i sliced carrot and i sliced turnip, and cook for an hour. 
Then add .1 cup of rice, cook one hour more, and press 
through a sieve. After pressing through the sieve, return to 
the stove. Add nut milk enough to make of the right con- 
sistency and salt to taste. Just before serving, burn a little 
brown sugar and stir through it. This gives it a nice flavor 
and a rich color. 

CREAM SOUP. 

Wash thoroughly 1 2 pound of rice after picking out all the 
dark and colored ones. Put into a saucepan, and add 2 
quarts of water. Boil slowly for one hour, then rub through 
a sieve twice. Return to the stove. Season with salt, raw

turn to the stove and add salt and raw peanut cream to taste. 
Thicken with a little white flour to the right thickness for 
soup, and serve hot. 

CHESTNUT SOUP NO. 2. 

Shell, blanch, and boil chestnuts enough to make 2 cup- 
fuls when pressed through a sieve. Add boiling water very 
slowly, stirring all the time, and keeping the mixture smooth,

it thinner, add i cupful more. Add salt if desired. 

CHESTNUT SOUP NO. 3. 

Grind the chestnuts through the mill, not making them 
very fine; for each cup of the ground chestnuts add i cup 
of cold water. Work it well with a spoon or the hand and 
pour into a bowl lined with cheese-cloth, fold the edges of 
the cloth together, and press out the milk. Put this milk in a 
double boiler and let it cook for an hour or more. The starch 
in the milk will thicken it enough. It only needs a little salt 
and then is ready to serve. 

Chestnut milk contains too much raw starch to be eaten 
without cooking. 

CHESTNUT SOUP NO. 4. 

Take equal quantities of mashed chestnuts and well-cooked 
beans. Press them through a sieve, thin with boiling water, 
boil up once, salt to taste, and if desired a little onion juice

for one hour in i pint of cold water; then put in the inner 
cup of a double boiler, and place this in the outer boiler, in 
which the water should be boiling. Cook until the tapioca 
is perfectly clear. Heat the cucumbers, and add i teaspoon- 
ful of onion juice and salt to taste, and turn in the cooked 
tapioca. Have ready in the tureen 2 egg yolks well beaten.

meantime. Dry bread grated fine may be used for thickening 
instead of tapioca, if desired. 

GREEN CORN SOUP. 

Select corn that is tender, it must not be too ripe. Husk 
and remove all silks, and with a sharp knife cut each row of 
kernels through the center, and with the back of the knife 
scrape or press the kernels from the hulls. When the corn 
is removed from the cob, grind it through a loosely adjusted 
nut-butter mill to make it fine and smooth. To i pint of this 
corn pulp, add i pint of boiling water, and cook in a double 
boiler for a half-hour; then season with nut butter (almond 
is better, but the peanut is good), using i level tablespoonful 
dissolved in 2 of hot water; salt to taste. A milk made of 
i tablespoonful of raw peanut butter to i \ pints of water is 
excellent to season corn, but it must be cooked with the corn. 

DRIED CORN SOUP. 

Take nice, dried sweet corn, and grind through a grain or 
coffee mill. Take i cup of the ground sweet corn and cook 
in a double boiler one hour. Add i cup of nut milk; salt

days old is better than fresh bread; cut in even slices about 
two thirds of an inch thick, and place in the warming oven to 
dry, or in the oven if it is not too hot. If it is toasted too 
fast or the bread is moist, it will be hard and tough, but if it 
is dry and toasted slowly, it will be brittle and tender when

their turning black. When all are cleaned, slice as quickly 
as possible and drop into boiling hot water and cook until 
perfectly tender and nearly dry. Then rub through a colan- 
der and thin with nut cream (the raw peanut cream that has

and the water in which it was boiled into a nut gravy made 
like No. i, or if desired only the water may be added to give 
it the parsley taste. 

PARCHED CORN GRAVY. 

Make the corn flour by parching coarse corn thoroughly 
brown in the oven ; grind in coffee-mill to a fine flour. Use 
i tablespoonful of this, i tablespoonful of nut butter, and 
i cup of water. Mix smooth, and add more water while 
cooking to thin it to gravy consistency. Another gravy can 
be made by using gluten meal and ordinary milk, and still 
another by using white flour. 

TOMATO GRAVY NO. J. 

To i cup of strained tomatoes add i cup of water, i tea- 
spoonful of peanut butter, and salt to taste. Thicken with 
white flour. Serve on toast or roasts. 

TOMATO GRAVY NO. 2. 

Take i pint of water and i cup of sifted tomatoes, i tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, and j teaspoonful of salt, and i 
level tablespoonful of white flour. Put the water and sifted 
tomatoes in a saucepan and when boiling, add onion juice ; 
salt and thicken with the flour rubbed smooth in a little cold 
water. 

TOMATO GRAVY NO. 3. 

Make a cream gravy by dissolving i tablespoonful of 
almond butter in i pint of boiling water, and thicken with 
i heaping tablespoonful of white flour, and salt to taste. 
Then add just enough sifted tomatoes to make it a nice pink 
color, and give it a tomato taste. This is excellent on toast, 
boiled macaroni, or vegetables. 



GRAVIES. 315 

TOMATO NUT GRAVY. 

Make a gravy as directed in recipe No. i. Heat to boiling 
one half as much strained tomato, and thicken it as gravies are 
usually thickened. Put the two gravies together, stir well, 
and you have an excellent dressing for potato, rice, or plain 
boiled macaroni. 

MOCK MILK GRAVY. 

Take i large tablespoonful of raw peanut butter, dis- 
solve in i quart of water, and cook it in a double boiler for 
one hour. Then add two tablespoonfuls of white flour which 
has been rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Salt to taste, 
and cook for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

This is almost exactly like dairy milk gravy. 

RAW PEANUT MILK GRAVY. 

Take i pint of raw peanut milk and cook in the inner part 
of the double boiler for an hour or more, then salt to taste 
and add the well-beaten yolk of i egg. If too thick, thin 
with water to the right consistency. Do not cook long after 
the egg is added, as it may form curds. 

PECAN GRAVY WITH EGGS. 

Take i pint of boiling water, 2 level tablespoonfuls 
of pecan meal, i teaspoonful of peanut butter, a little salt, 
the yolk of i egg, and i level tablespoonful of white flour. 

Mix the nut meal, salt, nut butter, and yolk of the egg 
until smooth, then put in a little warm water and rub smooth, 
add the flour, and when evenly mixed, stir into the boiling 
water. This is an excellent substitute for meat gravy.

HICKORY-NUT GRAVY. 

To make i pint of gravy, take i pint of boiling water and 
dissolve in it 2 tablespoonfuls of hickory-nut meal ground quite 
fine, and thicken with i heaping tablespoonful of white flour, 
rubbing smooth in a very little cool water. Season with salt, 
and a very little minced parsley, if the flavor of parsley is 

liked by the family. 

PECAN GRAVY. 

Take i cup of water, i heaping tablespoonful of pecan 
meal, i heaping tablespoonful of white flour, and a little 
salt. 

Dissolve the meal in the boiling hot water, then salt and 
stir in the flour after it has been rubbed smooth in a little cold 
water. Very good. 

ROASTED PINE-NUT GRAVY. 

Wash the pine-nuts and roast them in the oven till of a 
light-brown color. Put them in a cold, dry place to cool; 
when cold, grind to a butter. 

To I heaping tablespoonful of this, use i pint of water, i 
tablespoonful of white flour, and salt to suit the taste. Dis- 
solve the butter and flour with the water, adding a little at a 
time. Let it boil for ten or fifteen minutes, to be sure that 
the flour is thoroughly cooked. 

The roasted pine-nut gives it a very meaty flavor. 

ROASTED ALMOND GRAVY. 

Blanch the almonds and roast them in the oven until they 
are of a straw color. When perfectly cold, grind as fine as 
possible. 



GRAVIES. 3 I 7 

Use i heaping tablespoonful of this butter to I pint of 
water, and thicken with i tablespoonful of white flour which 
has been lightly browned in the oven. Flour that is scorched 
in the least should not be used. Salt the gravy to suit the 
taste. Roasting the almonds gives them more of a meaty 
flavor.

ALMOND MEAL PIE CRUST. 

ONE cup of white flour, | cup of almond meal, ^ cup 
of cold water, and a pinch of salt. Mix the flour 
and almond meal thoroughly together, add water and salt, 
and knead but not long. This is sufficient for one two- 
crusted pie. 

COCOANUT PIE CRUST. 

One cup of white flour, ] cup of cocoanut-oil, pinch of salt, 
and | cup of cold water. Warm the cocoanut-oil, and thor- 
oughly rub it with the flour; then add the water and salt, and 
knead enough to roll out well. 

RAW NUT-BUTTER PIE CRUST. 

One cup of white flour, 2 large tablespoonfuls of raw nut 
butter, ^ cup of cold water, and salt to taste. Rub the but- 
ter with the flour, add salt and water, and knead lightly. 
This is enough for one pie with two crusts. The roasted 
butter can be used in the same way, but it makes a dark crust. 

PEANUT MEAL PIE CRUST. 

One cup of white flour, cup of peanut meal, i cup of 
cold water, and a pinch of salt. Mix the flour and nut meal 
together thoroughly, add water and salt, and knead, but not 
long. This is enough for one two-crusted pie. 
[320]

NUTCOA PIE CRUST. 

Take i tablespoonful of nutcoa and rub it well in I cup of 
white flour, then add 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water. Knead 
as little as possible, and roll out as soft as you can handle. 
More flour may have to be added to keep it from sticking. 

NUTCOA TART PASTE. 

Take i cup of white flour, and mix with it a little salt and 
about i cup of nutcoa and just enough cold water to make it 
stick together; then roll out and cut in any desired shape. A 
nice paste for tarts can be made from almond butter or almond 
meal. If the almond meal is used, use less flour; about | 
cup of flour to i cup of almond meal, and a little water. 

CHUFA CREAM PIE CRUST. 

Let the chufa milk set for several hours, or overnight 
(see index for Chufa Milk), after which skim off the cream. 
Take i cup of the thin cream, i cup flour, a pinch of salt, 
and enough cold water to make a stiff dough. Work as little 
as possible. This makes a sweet, crisp, delicious crust. 

The chufa should be cultivated by every farmer. It is a 
sweet, tuberous nut, rich in fats, and, to my knowledge, may 
be successfully raised as far north as Minnesota. It is quite 
certain that they will grow in Canada. It would be well to 
experiment. (See article on Chufa.) 

PECAN OR HICKORY-NUT PIE CRUST, 

Grind the nuts to a fine meal. To } 2 a cup of the meal, 
i cup flour, and a pinch of salt, add sufficient water to make 
a dough which can be rolled. Work but little. The crust

322 GUIDE FOR NI'T COOKERY. 

\vill be dark colored, on account of the skins of the nuts ; but 
it will be crisp and palatable. Cream obtained from these 
nuts would make a lighter crust. 

PINE-NUT PIE CRUST. 

Grind the pine-nuts to a meal, in a nut-butter mill. Take 
i cup of the meal, I cup of white flour, and a pinch of salt, 
to which add nearly | cup of water, and roll out with as 
little kneading as possible. 

COCOANUT CREAM PIE CRUST. 

If too thick, add a small quantity of water to the cream, 
making, perhaps, twice as much as before thinning. Add a 
pinch of salt, if desired, and enough flour to roll out well. 
Knead as little as possible. The result is an excellent crust, 
with a slight cocoanut flavor. 

RAW PEANUT CREAM PIE CRUST. 

Skim cream from peanut milk after it has set overnight. 
If too thick, use equal parts of water and cream, taking \ 
cup of the cream, and \ cup of water, a pinch of salt, and 
enough flour to knead and roll out. Knead no more than 
necessary. This makes a good, tender crust, having no taste 
of raw peanuts. It is enough for one pic with two crusts. 

ALMOND CREAM PIE. 

Take I pint of almond cream made by dissolving I rounding 
tablespoonful of almond butter in i pint of water, adding but 
a little at a time. Add \ cup of granulated sugar, and let 
stand while beating the whites of 3 eggs to a stiff froth ;

Stew tart apples until soft and dry as possible, put 
through a colander, and add 2 well-beaten eggs, i tablespoon- 
ful of almond butter, ^ cup of sugar, and a little grated nut- 
meg for each pie. Bake with one crust. If a frosting is put 
on top, use less sugar in the pie. 

ONE CRUST APPLE PIE. 

Select nice, ripe apples which are quite tart and will 
cook up white and soft. Cook with as little water as possi- 
ble. When done, put through a sieve, add ^ cup of sugar, 
or more if needed, and the white of i egg. Beat to a 
foam. Pour into a pie-tin lined with a very tender crust. 
Bake until the crust is done, then cover with the beaten 
white of i egg, ^ cup of powdered sugar, and \ teaspoonful 
of vanilla. Return to the oven and brown slightly. 

DRIED APPLE PIE. 

Wash the dried apples thoroughly, cover with cold water, 
and stew gently until tender, then put them through a colan- 
der or vegetable press. Sweeten to taste, add a little grated 
lemon or orange peel, and i well-beaten egg. Bake in two 
crusts, and warm slightly before eating. 

BANANA PIE. 

Mash enough good, ripe bananas to fill a pie crust, add 
sugar and vanilla to taste ; or, if preferred, a very sour apple 
grated fine may be added to each pie instead of the vanilla.

lightly brown. It should be cold before serving. 

CORN-STARCH PIE. 

Take 2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, i quart of raw pea- 
nut milk that has been cooked, i teaspoonful of rose-water

Line a pie-tin with a good paste. Take i quart of cran- 
berries, and put them on the stove in a granite stew basin with 
a little water. Cook until they pop open, then put through a

the top strips of the paste rolled thin. 

CITRON PIE. 

Take a good ripe citron, cut in slices, remove the seeds, 
cut in small pieces, and stew in a granite stew-pan until very 
tender. This will take two or three hours. They should be 
nearly dry when done. At the same time have some very 
sour applies cooking ; cook slowly so that they will not get 
mushy, drain off the juice, and add the juice only to the cit- 
ron ; sweeten to taste, thicken with a very little corn-starch 
or flour, and bake with two crusts. This makes a very nice 
pie. Other fruit juices may be used instead of the apple, 
as the cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, etc. 



PIES. 325 



COCOANUT PIE. 

Shorten the crust with cocoanut oil, and make a filling 
as follows : -

dish, add a very little water, cover, and let bake until tender, 
but not mushy. Then carefully remove to individual glass 
dishes (the dishes should be warmed to prevent them from 
breaking) ; pour over the apple a portion of the cooked tapi- 
oca. Serve just warm. 

GREEN CORN PUDDING. 

Take \ pint sweet corn, cut from the ear, or canned corn 
will do, 2 eggs, i pint of almond milk, and a little salt. 
Beat the eggs, add the milk, salt, and corn, and steam one 
hour. 

BREAD PUDDING. 

Take | cup of toasted bread-crumbs, \ cup of sugar, I 
quart of water or nut milk, the beaten yolks of 4 eggs, 
and i whole egg. Mix thoroughly, and flavor with salt and 
vanilla. Pour into an oiled pudding dish ; set in a pan of 
hot water, and bake until the custard is well set. Remove 
from the oven, and cool. Then cover with i.| cups of prune 
marmalade. Cover the whole with a meringue made of the 
whites of 4 eggs beaten with 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Brown in the oven. Very nice. 

MOTHER'S PUDDING. 

Take i cup of chopped seedless raisins, 2 cups of chopped 
tart apples. Mix together, and fill a granite basin with alter- 
nate layers of the fruit and bread-crumbs, having the bread- 
crumbs on the top. Do not use more bread-crumbs than 
fruit. Moisten the whole with a tablespoonful of lemon-juice 



PUDDINGS 337 

in a cupful of cold water. Let stand for a few minutes, and 
then add enough more water to thoroughly saturate. Place 
in a larger basin of hot water, and bake until the apples are 
perfectly tender. 

STEAMED APPLE PUDDING. 

Take 2 cups of grated bread, A cup seeded raisins, i cup 
of chopped apples, j cup of sugar, and 3 eggs. 

Mix the bread-crumbs, raisins, apples, and sugar thor- 
oughly together, and add the eggs well beaten. A little 
grated nutmeg may be added if desired. 

FIG PUDDING. 

Take 5 eggs, ^ cup of ground figs, 2 cups of bread-crumbs, 
| cup of sugar, i cup of coarsely ground nuts, and i cup 
chopped citron or j pound dried citron ground through the 
mill. Add \ teaspoonful of vanilla, and salt to taste. Beat 
the eggs without separating, and mix with the other ingredi- 
ents. Put in a pudding dish, and steam four hours. 

APPLE DUMPLING, 

Make the dough the same as for roly-poly given on 
next page. Pare as many tart apples as you want dump- 
lings. Take out the core with a sharp knife; or a new 
clothes-pin may be used, by taking hold of the spreading part 
of the pin, and pressing it in at the blow end of the apple; 
then whirl it around a few times, and the core will come out 
nicely, and leave the apple whole. Fill the hole with sugar. 
Roll out the dough about one-half inch thick, or thicker if you 
desire, take enough to cover the apple, and pinch together. 
When all the apples are covered, let it rise until it is light, and 
bake in a moderate oven.

APPLE ROLY-POLY. 

Make a raised biscuit dough as follows: ; \ cake of com- 
pressed yeast or ] cup of hoim'-madr yeast, i cup of nut 
milk. Let rise until very light, then add the following: ] cup 
of sugar, i cup of nut meal, a little salt, and flour enough to 
make a stiff dough. Roll out two thirds of an inch thick. 
Have ready 2 cups of chopped apples, \ cup of raisins, and i 
tablespoonful of walnut meal. Mix, and spread on the dough; 
then beginning at one end, roll up like a jelly roll cake. 
Press edges well together to keep the juice in. Set where 
it will rise, and when light, steam for one hour or more. 

CARROT PUDDING NO. J. 

Take i cup of cooked carrots rubbed through a colander, 
i cup of nut milk made by dissolving i teaspoonful of nut but- 
ter in a cup of water, i cup of sugar, pinch of salt, and i well- 
beaten egg. Flavor with vanilla. Mix thoroughly together, 
and bake like custard. 

CARROT PUDDING NO. 2. 

Take i cup of grated carrots, | cup of coarsely ground 
nuts (walnuts, hickory-nuts, or pecans), i cup of seeded

PUDDINGS. 339 

grated rind of the lemon and strained juice. Moisten this 
mixture with eggs and sufficient water to make a thick batter. 
Put into an oiled pudding dish, and steam three hours. 

This recipe is not good for weak stomachs, as the lemon 
hinders the digestion of starch, and is apt to cause it to fer- 
ment in the stomach. 

ESCALLOPED APPLES. 

Oil a pudding dish, and put a layer of peeled, sliced apples 
in the bottom. Sprinkle with sugar and flour and a very little 
nut meal. Fill the dish in this manner, and bake one hour, 
covering the dish to prevent burning on the top. Serve cold 
or hot. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

Make a custard of the yolks of 4 eggs and 2 whole eggs, 
^ of a quart of water, a pinch of salt, and sugar to taste. 
Cook just enough to let the custard set, but not to get watery. 
Pour into a large dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, flavoring with sugar and vanilla. Take a spoonful at 
a time, and place in gently boiling water; leave a minute and 
turn over, leave another minute and take out, placing on top 
of the custard. Serve as cold as possible. 

APPLE FOAM. 

Peel and grate i large sour apple, sprinkling over it a 
small cupful of powdered sugar as you grate it, to keep it 
from turning dark. Break into this the whites of two eggs, 
and beat it all constantly for one-half hour. Take care to 
have it in a large bowl, as it beats up very light and stiff. 
Heap this in a glass dish, pour a fine, smooth custard around 
it, and serve.

CRANBERRY TAPIOCA. 

Take 3 cups of cranberry juice, the juice of i orange, \ 
cup "minute " tapioca, or sago, and j cup sugar ; boil gently 
for fifteen minutes ; serve with nut cream. 

TAPIOCA AND NUTS. 

Soak i cup of tapioca in i pint of water, add i quart of 
boiling water, and cook in a double boiler until clear; then 
stir in i cup of seedless raisins and i cup chopped almonds 
and cook one hour or longer. Some use stoned or even 
whole raisins, and others a mixture of raisins and currants. 
This can be molded, and used cold with nut meal sprinkled 
over it, or with a nut gravy. 

FAIRY PUDDING. 

Select good tart apples that will cook quickly, put them 
in a bowl or pudding dish, and place in the oven to heat. 
\Yhile it is heating, make a puff paste by mixing i cup of 
flour, i cup of nut milk, i egg well beaten, and a little salt. 

Beat the flour and salt into the milk, then add the well- 
beaten egg by folding it in, and pour this over the apples, 
which should be sprinkled with a little sugar before pouring 
on the batter. Bake in a quick oven. 

SURPRISE PUDDING. 

Cut one-half inch slices of white bread with a cooky cutter, 
and pour over the pieces cranberry juice, or any other fruit 
juice which will color them pink or red; place two together 
on a saucer, and cover with a hot sauce made with i pint of 
cocoanut milk thickened with i tablespoonful of corn-starch, 
and sweetened to taste. Stir until it thickens, and let cook

for about ten or fifteen minutes; then pour this hot over the 
pink rounds of bread, and serve at once. The white sauce 
covers up the pink, and gives a pleasant surprise to the eater.

ground, and stirred to a paste with water. When spread, 
put two of the stars together. If desired, the bread may be 
spread with nut butter before putting on the dates. Put on 
the top of each a little pyramid of jelly cut by turning a tea- 
spoon in the jelly. The accompanying figure will help to get 
the correct idea. This dessert is to be served in individual 
dishes with nut cream; cocoanut cream is very nice with this 
dessert.

ALMOND CREAM SAUCE. 

TAKE i cup of almond cream, A cup of powdered sugar. 
Cream together, and just before serving, add vanilla, and 
2 tablespoonfuls of white currant juice or white grape juice, 
or if desired, the juice of I lemon. 

ALMOND SAUCE. 

Take i cup of almond milk, and when boiling, thicken 
with i teaspoonful of white flour rubbed smooth in a little 
cold water. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, then stir in | cup 
of almond meal, or almonds blanched and dried in the oven 
until crisp and then chopped, and lastly add the well-beaten 
white of an egg, folding it in. Remove from the stove at 
once. Other nuts may be used in the same way. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

Select good tart apples that have a white flesh; peel and 
-rate, adding a little sugar while grating to keep them from 
turning dark. To i grated apple add the white of i egg and 
i tablespoonful of sugar. Beat for twenty or twenty-five 
minutes, and then place on top of a dish of pudding. This is 
especially nice for cold puddings, but the sauce should not be 
made until needed

BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

Quarter and core good tart apples, put them with a table- 
spoonful of water in a pudding dish, and place in the oven. 
Bake until the}' are all of a mush, then beat with a silver or 
wooden spoon until they are foamy. Add sugar and a little 
peanut cream to suit the taste. 

BANANA FOAM. 

Take 2 large ripe bananas or 3 small ones, and mash with 
a fork. Add the whites of 2 eggs and ^ tablespoonful of sugar, 
and beat with an egg beater for from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, or until it is very stiff. The colder the eggs and bana- 
nas are, the quicker it will get stiff. Serve at once. This is 
excellent on grains, toast, or desserts, or as a food for the 
sick, as it is nutritious and very easily digested. 

BOILED SAUCE. 

Melt | pint of sugar in a very little water. Let it boil, 
and then add ^ cup of water, or ^ cup of fruit juice. When 
hot, pour this over the well-beaten whites of 2 eggs, beating 
all the time to get it smooth and evenly cooked. A little 
rose-water or vanilla may be added, if desired. When fruit 
juice is used, this makes a very nice filling for a layer-cake, 
and is also excellent on steamed puddings. 

COCOANUT SAUCE. 

Take i cup of cocoanut cream as directed (see index); 
thicken it with i teaspoonful of white flour, add I tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, and if desired, the beaten yolk of i egg. 



346 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 



CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Stew i quart of dark cranberries in enough water to cover 
them. \Yhen they have burst, put them through a colander 
or sieve, add I pound, which is 2\ cups, of sugar. Let boil a 
few minutes, and then it is ready to serve. This is an excel- 
lent sauce for nearly all kinds of puddings. 

FIG SAUCE. 

Take good figs, remove the stems, wash in warm water, 
and grind in the family nut-butter mill. If adjusted closely, 
it will grind the seeds to a flour. It is not necessary to cut 
the figs in pieces, as they can be pressed in with the fingers 
without it. When ground, thin with hot water to the con- 
sistency of gravy, and if desired, it can be flavored with nut 
butter. 

FRUIT JUICE SAUCE. 

Take A cup of nut butter, i cup of sugar, i tablespoonful 
of corn-starch, i cup of cold water, and ^ cup of fruit juice. 
Cream the butter and sugar together, and stir in the corn- 
starch wet in the water. Cook until thick, and then add the 
fruit juice. The water may be omitted, and i cup of the 
juice used if desired, unless it is quite acid fruit. The juice 
of grapes, strawberries, cranberries, raspberries, etc., may 
be used. 

LEMON SAUCE. 

Take f cup of sugar, J cup of nut butter, i egg, the juice 
and a little of the grated rind of i lemon, i teaspoonful of 
nutmeg, and .\ cup of boiling water. Put into a double boiler, 
and heat until very hot but not boiling. Stir constantly. 



SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS. 347 



LEMON SYRUP. 

Select good, solid, heavy lemons, as the soft, spongy ones 
contain but little juice ; wash and wipe them dry. Roll on a 
plate or platter until the oil starts, then rub with sugar (gran- 
ulated is the best) until all the oil is taken up by the sugar. 
Squeeze out the juice, and strain it through a cloth to remove 
all the seeds and white particles, as they will make it bit- 
ter. Allow about i i pounds of sugar to i pint of juice, 
using the sugar in which the lemons were rubbed. Let it 
boil gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, and strain if it is 
not clear. Reheat, bottle, seal tight, and put in a cool place. 
Lemon syrup, sealed in this way, will keep for any length of 
time, and is always ready for use; it is nice for flavoring pud- 
dings, sauces, cakes, and pies. 

ORANGE SYRUP. 

Select good, fresh oranges, wash and wipe them well, and 
roll them on a platter until the oil starts from the pores, then 
take i pound of sugar, a little in each hand, and rub the 
oranges until all the oil is out, changing the sugar as is 
needed, and do this with all the oranges you wish to make 
into syrup in the same way. Then squeeze out all the juice, 
strain it, put in the pound of sugar saturated with the oil, 
which will be enough for i pint of the syrup. Put on the 
back of the stove, and simmer gently for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Then if it is not perfectly clear, strain through a 
cloth. Reheat, and put it in bottles; cork, and seal tight. 
This syrup is very nice to flavor puddings and pies, and can 
be made when oranges are cheap, and then can be kept the 
year round.

well), leave out j cup, and grind or pound the remainder 
to a paste in a mortar. Beat the whites of four eggs to 
a crumbly stiffness. Add i teaspoonful of rose-water and 
^ pound of powdered sugar. Fold all together. Spread 
in a thin layer on the top of each layer of cake; take the 
almonds that were left out, slice them crosswise quite fine,

walnuts. 



CAKES. 



and pies which are filled with animal fats, irritating 

spices, and are raised with baking-powder or soda, are 
certainly very unwholesome; to use them in our bill of fare 
could work nothing but injury to all who partake. 

Animals are becoming so diseased that it is no longer safe 
to use their flesh as food, and even if they were not diseased, 
free fats are hard of digestion. Neither the saliva nor the 
gastric juice digests fats; therefore if particles of food are 
covered with free fat, the gastric juice can not digest them, 
and they remain in the stomach undigested. 

In weak stomachs, fermentation will set in, and a sour 
stomach and sometimes headache will be the result. Nut 
butter, nut meal, etc., are not free fats, as they can be 
readily dissolved in water, forming an emulsion or cream, 
while free fats will float on top of the water and not mix. 

The spices so commonly used in cakes and pies are not 
foods, and only act as irritants in the stomach. The soda and 
baking-powder, generally used in cake baking, are very 
injurious. Soda is alkaline in its nature. The gastric juice 
is acid. If too much soda is used for the sour milk or cream 
of tartar, the effect will be to sweeten the gastric juice, and 
destroy its digestive properties. Baking-powder which is 
mixed with the proper proportion of alkali and acid elements, 
is not so apt to have that effect, but all baking-powders are 
more or less adulterated with alum and other elements which 
are very injurious to the stomach. 
[354] 



CAKES. 355 

" Saleratus in any form should not be introduced into the 
stomach, for the effect is fearful. It eats the coatings of the 
stomach, causes inflammation, and frequently poisons the 
whole system." 

Spices and condiments, which usually enter into cake ma- 
king, are equally injurious. The effect that they have upon 
the stomach can be illustrated by putting them upon a raw 
surface or in the eye ; inflammation immediately takes place. 
They irritate the nerves, cause irritability and peevishness, 
and create a craving for something more highly spiced, which 
often leads to grosser forms of intemperance. 

Cakes, as usually made, with large quantities of free fats 
and sugar, clog the system, and make a bad quality of blood ; 
they also have a bad effect upon the kidneys. To dispose of 
this kind of food brings a heavy tax upon the whole system. 

The object of the author is to place before the public a 
few recipes for light, appetizing, and beautiful cakes and 
pies, without the use of animal fat, milk, butter, cream, 
soda, baking-powder, or spices. Not that they should be 
recommended as an every-day diet, or to take the place of 
simple foods, but as an occasional luxury, and as a substitute 
for more injurious pastry. 

In order to make nice, light cakes without soda or baking- 
powder, more pains must be taken, and the recipes carefully 
followed. All material must be ready to add, the flour and 
sugar sifted, the eggs broken and separated, if they are to be 
beaten separately, the seasoning and shortening all ready to 
put in, and the cake tins and oven ready. Then much de- 
pends upon the beating of the eggs. The cakes are raised by 
the expansion of the air bubbles that are beaten into the eggs ; 
it is therefore necessary that as much air as possible be beaten 
in and retained. After adding the whites and yolks, they should 
not be beaten or stirred, \a\ti. folded in, and especially after the 



356 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

{lour is added, they should be worked as little as possible or 
the cake will be tough and heavy. A great deal depends 
upon the baking ; if the oven is too hot, the cake will crust 
over before it has time to rise ; if it is too cool, the air will 
escape before the heat is sufficient to expand it, and in either 
case it causes a failure. A moderate and even temperature is 
what is needed. The cooling also has something to do with 
its being a success. Sometimes they look nice and light when 
removed from the oven, and then begin to fall. The best rem- 
rdy for this is to bake in the Misses Lisk's baking tins. They 
do not need oiling ; when the cake is done, turn it bottom side 
up on the legs of the tin until it is cold. If these tins can not 
be had, bake in a common bake tin, lined with oiled paper. 
When done, cover the top with a paper or napkin to prevent 
its cooling too fast. 

The flour for cake making should be granular ground ; 
spring wheat is the best, although all kinds can be used, but 
will not be so light. Gluten can be used instead of flour, but 
requires only two thirds as much. 

Granulated sugar is the best for cake making, and should 
be of fine granules. The coarse granulated sugar ivill not 
make a light cake. 

None need fear that they will not succeed, for persever- 
ance will win the race. If the first cake is not so very light, 
the next one will be better ; for experience will help to make 
it faster, and rapidity is the most essential thing in making 
unleavened cakes. 

ALMOND CAKE. 

Take \ pound of powdered sugar, \ pound of seedless rai- 
sins, 4 eggs, \ pound of rice flour, 6 ounces of flour, i cup of 
almond meal. Mix meal and sifted sugar together, beat the 
yolks and whites separately to a stiff froth, then fold them

together, and fold in the meal and sugar. The raisins should 
be well washed and powdered with flour, and lastly fold in 
the flour. Have ready the following icing: i cup of sifted 
powdered sugar, 2 whites of eggs, | pound of almond but- 
ter. Oil a bake tin, and put in a layer of the cake dough, 
then spread with a thin layer of the icing, and so on, having 
the cake on top. Bake in a moderate oven. 

COCOANUT CAKE NO. J. 

Take 5 eggs, i cup of almond meal, i cup of sugar, salt 
to taste, i tablespoonful of water, i cup of granular white 
flour (Pillsbury's Best). Beat the yolks and whites sepa- 
rately. To the beaten yolks add the sugar a little at a time, 
continually beating. Then add the salt to the whites, and 
beat until quite stiff, then add the water, and beat until it has 
a cooked appearance. Turn the whites into the yolk mix- 
ture, and fold in lightly, so as to not get the air out of the 
whites. Then fold in the nut meal in the same way as the 
whites of the eggs; lastly fold in the sifted flour. Work as 
little as possible after the nuts and flour are added, as it will 
make it heavy and tough. Bake on jelly tins, and when cool, 
use for a filling a cocoanut sauce as directed (see index). 
Sprinkle dessicated cocoanut on top.

spoonful of lemon-juice, and 6 eggs. First beat the yolks of 
the eggs until thick, then add the honey, a little at a time, 
and beat again very thoroughly. Add the caraway seed,

spoonful of lemon-juice, i tablespoonful of ice-water, and a 
pinch of salt. Beat yolks to a cream, add sugar, beat up 
again to a stiff cream, then add them to the whites (previ- 
ously beaten stiff) by pouring over gently, dipping down the 
side t of the bowl and up through the center with as few 
strokes as possible. To avoid toughening, sift over it half 
the flour, folding it in, and add the remainder. Bake in 
unoiled tins, two layers, twenty minutes. Filling : - 

White of i egg, grated rind and juice of i lemon, tea- 
spoonful of lemon essence, and thicken with confectioners' 
sugar. Or use the following : -

fectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of nut butter. Mix thor- 
oughly, and beat to a creamy consistency. 

LADY BISCUITS. 

Sift \ pound of powdered sugar, add | cup of water, place 
in the saucepan on the stove, then add the yolks of 9 eggs, 
and beat until it is warm; then remove from the stove, and 



302 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

beat for ten minutes, or until it is cold. Whip the whites 
with a pinch of salt to a very stiff froth, then fold them with 
the other mixture, and lightly fold in 10 ounces of white 
flour. A little vanilla may be added to the whites while 
beating. Bake in well-oiled gem irons, sifting powdered 
sugar over the top, or a little colored sugar may be used. 
Bake in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. 

MALT CAKE. 

Take I cup of malt, i tablespoonful of sugar, i cup of nut 
meal, | teaspoonful of vanilla, i^ cups of gluten or zwieback, 
i tablespoonful of lemon-juice with a little of the grated rind, 
and 4 eggs. Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks until stiff; 
then add the grated lemon rind and the malt a little at a 
time, beating it vigorously. Then pour it into the whites of 
the eggs, which should be beaten to a very stiff froth. The 
best way is to add the salt to the whites, and beat until 
frothy, but not stiff or white, then add the lemon-juice and 
beat until it is very fine, stiff, and crumbly. Now fold the 
whites and yolks together, fold in the nut meal, and lastly 
the gluten or bread-crumbs as lightly and quickly as possible. 
Bake in the Misses Lisk's bake tins if possible; if not, bake in 
a common cake tin without oiling, and when done, turn bot- 
tom side up across another tin that is right side up, so that the 
air can circulate under the cake. By turning bottom side 
up, it will prevent it from falling while cooling. To prepare 
bread-crumbs, let some white, light, bread dry until is it per- 
fectly dry clear through. The larger the pieces of bread are, 
the easier it is to get hold of it to grate. Then sift through 
a sieve to remove the coarser particles. They can be rolled 
on a bread board and sifted again. When there is danger of 
their being heavy, use the bread-crumbs instead of flour 



CAKES. 363 

in cakes, as the bread-crumbs will help them to be light. 
Gluten has the same effect. This cake should be baked in a 
moderate oven and watched carefully, as it burns very easily. 
When the oven can be easily regulated, have it hot for the 
first ten minutes, then cooler the rest of the time. Do not 
open the oven for ten minutes after the cake has been put in. 

MARBLE CAKE. 

Make the light part of the cake like snow cake, only add 
i cup of almond meal. Make the dark part by beating the 
9 yolks of the eggs to a stiff froth. Add the juice of i lemon 
while beating, then add the sugar, and beat again. Add i cup 
of walnut meal, a little salt, i teaspoonful of caraway seed 
ground fine, i teaspoonful of caramel made by scorching 
brown sugar, this will give it a nice, dark color. Put into 
cake tins by dropping a tablespoonful of the light mixture 
and one of the dark until all is in. Bake as other cakes. 

MERINGUES. 

Take i pound of sugar, i pound of almond meal, the 
yolks of 6 eggs whipped to a cream, 2 teaspoonfuls of rose- 
water, and i pound of sifted flour. Beat the eggs separately, 
and add the sugar and rose-water to the yolks, then add the 
beaten whites of the eggs, almond meal, and the flour. Roll 
out about one-half inch thick, and cut in round cakes. Place 
on oiled tins one inch apart, and bake in a quick oven. 

NUTMEATO CAKE. 

Take \ cup of grated nutmeato, ^ cup of finely grated 
bread-crumbs, \ cup of small, seedless raisins or English cur- 
rants, i cup of fine granulated sugar, the juice of i lemon with 



364 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

a little of the grated rind, \ cup of peanut cream, a pinch of 
salt, 4 eggs, and a little nutmeg if desired. Mix the bread- 
crumbs with the nutosia and the grated lemon peel, beat 
the yolks of the eggs stiff, add the sugar, and beat again, 
then add the nut cream. Beat the whites two minutes in a 
separate dish. Add salt and lemon-juice, and beat until 
very stiff and crumbly. Pour in the yolk mixture and fold 
in carefully; then fold in the mixture of bread-crumbs and 
nutosia and the raisins dried and rolled in flour. Bake in 
well-oiled gem irons for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

COCOANUT OIL CAKE. 

Stir together until very creamy and light i pound, or 2\ 
cups, of sugar, and \ pound, or \ cup, of cocoanut oil. 1 Sepa- 
rate the whites and yolks of 8 eggs, add a pinch of salt to the 
whites, and beat until thick, but not too stiff, then add I 
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and beat until it is very stiff and 
has a cooked appearance; place on the ice while beating the 
yolks; beat the yolks until stiff, and add one half the grated 
rind of i lemon, then pour the yolk mixture with the beaten 
whites. Fold in carefully but quickly, dipping the spoon in at 
the edge of the dish and bringing it up through the middle. 
Beating or stirring causes the air which you have beaten into 
the eggs to escape. Then fold in lightly i pound of flour, 
sifting on about one fifth of it at a time. Work as little as 
possible after adding the flour or it will not be so good. The 
secret of making nice cake without baking-powder is in hav- 
ing all the material ready before beginning the cake, and in 
the rapidity with which it is put together.

COCOANUT OIL COOKIES. 

Take f cup of cocoanut oil, i cup of sugar, and 3 eggs 
beaten together to a cream. Use just enough flour to mix, 
and roll thin. 

NUT CAKE. 

Take 5 eggs, I cup of fine, granulated sugar, | cup of 
gluten No. 3 or I cup of granular white flour, I cup of 
coarsely ground nuts (walnuts, hickory-nuts, pecans, hazel- 
nuts, or almonds, or peanut meal), i tablespoonful of cold 
water, i teaspoonful of vanilla, and A teaspoonful of salt. 
Have all things in readiness. Separate the eggs, and beat 
the yolks until they are thick, then add the sugar a little at a 
time, beating all the time until it is very stiff. Add the salt to 
the whites of the eggs, and beat until thick but not very stiff. 
Add the water and the vanilla, and beat until it has a cooked 
appearance. Then fold the yolk mixture into the whites, put 
in the nuts and fold gently but quickly in, and lastly fold in the 
flour gently but quickly, and just enough to have it even. Too 
much working after the flour and nuts are added makes it 
tough and lets the air out. (The Misses Lisk's cake tins are 
the best. Do not oil them.) Bake in a moderate oven 
forty-five minutes and turn the tins top side down to cool. 

NUT CUP CAKE. 

Take | cup of nut cream made by dissolving i heaping 
teaspoonful of nut butter in cup of cold water, | cup of fine 
granulated sugar, | cup of granular flour (spring wheat is 
best), i tablespoonful of corn-starch sifted with the flour, 2 
eggs, and salt and flavor to taste. 

Put together the same as gems or puffs. Have all the 
material ready before commencing to put the cake together. 



366 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

First, oil the gem irons and put them on the stove to warm. 
Now beat the yolks of the eggs, sugar, salt, and flavoring 
tcigvtlK-r until they are all of a foam, then take the hand and 
add the flour, slowly beating all the time to incorporate as 
much air as possible. When the flour is all in, add lastly the 
whites of the eggs which have previously been beaten very 
stiff. It is best to beat the whites first and place in an ice-chest 
or in a cool place, while you make the rest of the cake. Fold 
or stir the whites in just enough to have it well mixed. Fill the 
gem irons, and bake in a moderately hot oven. 

NUT AND FRUIT CAKE. 

Work together until smooth and creamy A pound (i\ 
cups) of sugar, and i tablespoonful of nutcoa. Add 5 eggs, 
the whites and yolks beaten separately; i pound of almond 
meal, ^ pound of stoned raisins, or seedless, \ pound of finely 
chopped citron, fresh if you have it, if not, use \ pound of the 
dried citron ground through a mill, a little grated orange peel 
or a little nutmeg. Fold well together, but do not stir or 
beat it, and bake in the Misses Lisk's cake tins in a rather 
slow oven. When done, remove from the oven and turn 
bottom side up on the legs. 

RAISED CAKE. 

Take i pound of sugar, i cup of peanut oil, i pint of 
peanut milk, i pint of warm water, flour as required, i cup 
of liquid yeast, A pound of raisins, i teaspoonful of caraway, 
.\- nutmeg grated, and i spoonful of vanilla. Cream the oil 
and sugar together, add the water and milk and enough flour 
to make a stiff dough, add the yeast and set overnight to 
rise ; in the morning add the fruit well washed and dredged 



CAKES. 367 

with flour ; then add the salt and flavoring. Put in oiled 
baking tin's and let rise. Bake forty-five minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

RICE CAKE. 

Take 10 ounces of ground rice, 3 ounces of white flour, 8 
ounces of powdered sugar, sifted, 8 eggs, and I teaspoonful 
of rose-water. Sift the flour, sugar, and rice together into 
the well-beaten yolks of the eggs, add the rose-water and a 
pinch of salt to the whites, beat to a very stiff froth, and 
fold it into the rest. Bake the cake in a deep pan lined with 
an oiled paper. If the oven is the right temperature, the 
cake will bake in twenty minutes. 

RICE CUP CAKE. 

Take 4 eggs, separate the whites and yolks, and beat the 
yolks ten minutes ; then add I cup of sugar and beat again. 
Add a pinch of salt and I tablespoonful of lemon-juice to the 
whites of the eggs, and beat until crumbly ; then fold with 
the yolk mixture ; also fold in 1 cup of ground rice and i cup 
of white flour sifted. Bake in gem irons or patty pans. A 
little ground caraway may be used if desired. 

RAW PEANUT CREAM CAKE. 

Take I cup of sugar, 4 eggs, i cup of white flour, | tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, I small lemon, and a little salt. Add the 
salt to the whites of the eggs, and beat until they are frothy ; 
then add ^ of the lemon-juice, and beat until it is very dry 
and has a cooked appearance. Set them in a cool room while 
beating the yolks. Add the remaining ^ of the lemon-juice 
to the yolks, and beat until stiff, then add the sugar and beat 
again. Add the raw peanut cream and beat very thoroughly, 



368 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

adding the vanilla. Then fold the white and yolk mixture 
together, dipping the spoon down at the edge of the dish and 
bringing it up through the middle ; then add the flour, sifting 
on half at a time and folding it in carefully. Work as little 
as possible, and bake in tins that are not oiled, in a very 
moderate oven for one and one-fourth hours. Try with a 
knitting needle, and when done, turn bottom side up on an- 
other tin so as to let the air circulate under the cake. The 
object in turning it bottom side up is to keep it from falling 
after it is removed from the oven. 

SEA FOAM CAKE. 

Mix together I .\ cups of powdered sugar, i cup of granu- 
lar white flour sifted three or four times. Then beat the 
whites of 8 eggs for two minutes. Add a pinch of salt and I 
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and beat until very stiff and 
crumbly, then fold in carefully, but quickly, the flour and 
sugar mixture, sifting in about one fourth of it at a time. 
Bake the same as snow cake. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

Take 4 eggs, | cup of sugar, i tablespoonful of water, ^ 
spoonful of vanilla or rose-water, and i cup of white flour. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs until very stiff, then add the sugar 
a little at a time until all is in, then add the water and flavor- 
ing and beat again. Add a little salt to the whites of the 
eggs and beat until they have a cooked appearance, and then 
fold them into the yolk mixture. Do not stir, as that will 
let the air out, but put the spoon down at the edge of the 
dish and bring it up though the middle. Sift the flour over 
it a little at a time, and fold in the same way, working as 
little as possible; for too much working will make it tough. 



CAKES. 369 

It should be thick and spongy when ready to put in the 
tins. If it is liquid, it is not a perfect success. The secret 
of making good unleavened cakes is in having everything ready 
before beginning to make the cake, and also in the rapidity 
with which it is put together. 

SNOW CAKE. 

Have all material and dishes ready before beginning the 
cake, and have the oven of the right temperature. Take the 
whites of 9 fresh, cold eggs and beat a few minutes, then add 
a pinch of salt, and I tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and beat 
until it is very stiff and crumbly; then beat in i cup of very 
fine granulated sugar, adding a little at a time, and lastly 
add i cup of white flour which has been sifted three or four 
times before measuring, adding a little at a time, and folding 
it in very carefully. Bake in Misses Lisk's baking tins with- 
out oiling, or in common baking tins lined with an oiled 
paper, being careful not to jar the tins, or the cake will fall. 

SWEATMEET ROLLS. 

Roll out a strip of tart paste about one eighth of an inch 
in thickness. Spread it with jam or ground fruits, such as 
raisins, dates, or figs. Roll it up, and pinch the ends up 
tight to keep the, sweetmeats in; glaze with the white of an 
egg. Bake in a moderate oven. 

WATERMELON CAKE. 

White part: Take the whites of 8 eggs, add a pinch of 
salt and i tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and beat to a stiff 
froth. Add the sugar, a little at a time, and continue beat- 
ing; then add the flour, and fold in carefully.

Pink part: Make this part like the white with the excep- 
tion of adding i tablespoonful of extracted beet juice instead 
of the lemon, and * cup of almond meal before adding the 
flour. Lastly stir in a few dark, seedless raisins as an imi- 
tation of seeds. Put the white part on the bottom and 
sides, then pour the pink in the center and put some of the 
white on top. When done, cover with green icing as 
directed below. 

Coloring Green.-- Look over, wash, and drain well, any 
quantity of spinach, and pound in a mortar to a pulp, wring 
it through a strong muslin cloth as dry as possible; pound the 
pulp again, wring it once more, and then cook the juice in a 
double boiler until it thickens like jelly. Then rub it through 
a fine sieve upon an oiled paper, and let it dry until it is a 
thick paste; add pulverized sugar until it spreads easily, 
spread on the cake, and dry. 

YEAST CAKE. 

To .\ of a compressed yeast-cake take i cup of warm 
water. Dissolve in it i level tablespoonful of nut butter, 
either almond or peanut, but the almond will make the 
whitest cake. Then add enough flour to make a good, stiff 
batter, and let rise until very light. Then add 2 well-beaten 
eggs, i cup of sugar, \ cup of nut meal, and \ spoonful of salt; 
flavor to suit the taste, and add about \ cup of flour. Beat 
thoroughly, and put in three jelly tins to rise again. When 
very light, bake in a moderate oven until done. Cool, and 
cover with a bread cloth, and put in a tight box or can to keep 
it moist for twenty-four hours. Then put any filling between 
the cakes you wish, as follows: Jelly, cocoanut cream sauce, 
or apple or banana foam as directed (see index). 



CAKES. 371 

WASHINGTON WEDDING CAKE. 

Take 2 pounds of raisins, 2 pounds of currants, i pound 
of citron, i pound of almond meal, i pound of sugar, } 2 
pound of almond butter, i pound of flour, i dozen of eggs, i 
tablespoonful of vanilla, I grated nutmeg, .\ cup of water, 
i teaspoonful of salt. The raisins and citron should be both 
cut up and rolled in flour. After the eggs are beaten very 
light, stir the fruit into them. Cream the almond, sugar, 
and water together. After stirring in the other ingredients, 
fold in the flour lastly. Turn into a well-oiled fruit-cake tin, 
and bake slowly for two or three hours. If it bakes too fast 
on top, put over it a piece of tin, a sheet-iron lid, or brown 
paper will do. This makes a very large cake. 

COCOANUT CREAM CAKE. 

Take 4 eggs, i cup of white flour, i cup of white granu- 
lated sugar, ^ cup of cocoanut cream, juice of i small lemon, 
and a pinch of salt. Put the salt and one half of the lemon- 
juice into the whites of the eggs, and beat until it has a 
cooked appearance, and place in a cool room or on ice while 
beating the yolks. Then add the rest of the lemon-juice to 
the yolks of the eggs, and beat until quite thick and creamy; 
then add the sugar and beat again, and lastly add the cream, 
and beat until it is thick. Then fold it into the white mixture, 
but do not beat it, and carefully fold in the flour, sifting a little 
of it, or about one fourth of it, on the top at a time. Work as 
little as possible after the flour is added, as it will make it 
tough. Bake in a moderate oven for i\ hours, being sure 
that it is done before removing. Cakes can not fall after 
they are done, if they are turned bottom side up when taken

from the oven, but the tins must not be oiled, and they 
must rest on something, so that the air can circulate under 
the cake. 

HICKORY CREAM CAKE. 

Take i\ cups of white flour, i small cup of granulated 
sugar, one scant half cup of hickory cream (this should be 
quite thick). Then mix with it the whites of the eggs, which 
should be beaten with the salt and lemon-juice until it has a 
cooked appearance. Fold them together carefully, and then 
fold in the flour, and pour into unoiled tins. Bake in a 
moderate oven for one hour and fifteen minutes. It takes 
longer to bake than cakes shortened with nut meal. It is 
always best to try them with a knitting-needle before remov- 
ing from the oven. This cake has a strong hickory-nut flavor, 
and is moist and tender like a cake made of dairy cream. It 
is very nice for loaf cake or jelly roll. 

NUT CREAM COOKIES. 

Take i cup of thin nut cream, 4 eggs, i^ cups of whites 
flour, i teaspoonful of vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat the 
whites and yolks separately, adding the salt to the whites 
before beating and the sugar to the yolks after they are well 
beaten; then mix them, and add the raw peanut cream, and 
beat again very thoroughly; then pour over the beaten whites, 
and fold carefully in; lastly fold in the white flour; have 
ready some well-oiled tins, and drop on about \ tablespoonful, 
and spread around in the shape of a cook\ It desired, a 
raisin may be put in the middle, or some almonds which have 
been coarsely chopped may be sprinkled over the top. A 
candied cranberry or cherry may be placed in the center, but 
it must be put on after baking.

CHESTNUT CAKE. 

Take 2 cups of chestnut flour, 5 eggs, i scant cup of 
sugar. 2 tablespoonfuls of water, and a pinch of salt. To 
make the chestnut flour, first dry the nuts before shelling, or 
toast them slightly with the shells on. By doing this the 
skins will be loosened and easily rubbed off without blanch- 
ing ; then grind them in a family grist-mill or a coffee-mill to 
a fine flour, or they may be ground through the nut-butter mill. 

When all material and cake tin is ready and the oven hot, 
separate the eggs, and beat the yolks to a thick cream with the 
sugar. Then beat the whites until they are stiff and crumbly, 
adding the water and salt after it begins to get foamy but be- 
fore it is stiff. Then pour in the yolk mixture, and fold it 
carefully in, and lastly fold in the 2 cups of chestnut flour. 
Bake like other cakes. 

CHESTNUT FRUIT CAKE. 

Take i| cups of mashed chestnuts, ii cups of chopped 
figs or dates, and | cup of sifted apples.. Blanch the chest- 
nuts, and boil until tender, rubbing them through a sieve or 
a colander. Cook good, tart apples in as little water as pos- 
sible ; when done, sift through a sieve. Add all the ingredi- 
ents, mixing thoroughly. If desired, add a little salt, and 
bake in an oiled tin until brown on top. Other fruits may be 
used if desired or more convenient. 

CHESTNUT DAINTY. 

Take i cup of cooked and sifted chestnuts and i cup of 
jelly. The chestnut pulp should be quite dry, and the jelly 
added while it is hot, or it may be heated afterward. Pour 
into a dish, and when cold, it is excellent for spreading on 
bread or crackers, or making sandwiches. 



3/4 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

CHESTNUT SWEET SOUFFLE. 

Take 2 cups of sifted stewed chestnuts, 2 eggs, j cup of 
sugar, and a pinch of salt. Separate the eggs, and beat the 
yolks to a stiff cream with the sugar ; then add the sifted 
chestnuts, a little at a time, and beat them in. Add the salt 
to the whites of the eggs, and beat until stiff and crumbly. 
Then fold the two mixtures together, pour into an oiled pie- 
tin, and bake in a quick oven. 

DATE DROP CAKES. 

Take i cup of stoned dates, i ^ cups of nut meal made 
from any kind of nuts, 3 eggs well beaten, \ teaspoonful of 
vanilla, i cup of whole-wheat flour. Grind the dates through 
the mill or chop them very fine, and mix the nut meal with 
them. Then add the vanilla, salt, and the eggs, which should 
be well beaten. Lastly, add the flour. Drop on oiled tins, 
and bake in a moderate oven for ten or fifteen minutes. If 
the dates are not fresh, a little water will have to be added to 
them before adding the butter. 

DATE COOKIES. 

Take 2 cups of nut butter, 3 cups of stoned dates, and 
enough flour to roll out well. Grind the dates through the 
mill or chop them very fine, and mix well with the nut butter, 
then add enough flour to roll out about one-fourth inch thick 
or thinner if desired, and bake in a moderate oven, as they 
scorch easily. 

CREAM PUFFS. 

Put i cup of hot water and ?> cup of nut oil into a stew- 
pan, and set it on the fire. When it begins to boil, pour in i 
pint of sifted flour, and beat and stir until it is smooth and 



CAKES. 375 

does not stick to the pan. Remove from the fire, and when 
cool, add 5 eggs, the yolks and whites of which have been 
beaten separately until very stiff ; add a little salt, and set in 
a warm place for half an hour, stirring frequently. Drop in 
large spoonfuls on oiled tins, about two inches apart, and 
bake in a very quick oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
When done, they should be light and crisp. When cold, cut 
a slit in the side, and put in all the custard possible. 

CREAM FOR FILLING.- -Take | cup of sugar, i cup of corn- 
starch, ij cups of cocoanut milk. Put the milk in a double 
boiler, and when hot, stir into it the corn-starch, which has 
been rubbed smooth, with a little cold water or cocoanut 
milk ; then stir in the sugar and salt, and let it come to a 
boil, stirring constantly ; set it in the outer part of the double 
boiler, and let it cook for half an hour. Add the well-beaten 
whites of 3 eggs, and remove to a cool place. When the 
filling is cool, flavor with vanilla or lemon, and fill the puffs. 
The filling can be varied by using the milk or cream of differ- 
ent nuts. 



ICING. 



ALLOW 10 teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar and \ tea- 
spoonful of lemon-juice to the white of I egg. Beat the 
egg until you can invert a spoonful of it without its falling, 
then beat in the sugar, a spoonful at a time. Add the lemon- 
juice, and spread it upon the warm cake with a broad knife 
dipped occasionally in cold water. Put in a cool, dry place 
to harden. If the cake is rich, dust with flour, then brush 
lightly with a napkin to remove what does not adhere, before 
frosting it. 

HARD OR PLAIN ICING. 

Take the whites of 4 eggs and i pound of powdered 
sugar well sifted, and beat the whites of the eggs with a 
spoon egg beater until frothy but not white; then add the 
sugar a little at a time, and beat from the bottom, so as to 
take up all the egg at each stroke. Continue this beating 
until it can be* cut with a knife clean and smooth like cake. 
This is for a large cake. 

CONFECTIONER'S ICING. 

Take the whites of 2 eggs which are very cold, or place 
them on ice for a few minutes, then beat them, adding a 
little at a time .\ pound of powdered sugar, beating until stiff 
enough to be cut with a knife. 
[376] 



ICING. 377 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Take I cup of nut milk, ^ pound of chocolate, and A pint 
of powdered sugar. Put the chocolate grated fine in a basin 
on the stove, add a little of the milk, and let it melt; then add 
the rest of the milk and the sugar. When this is hot, pour 
over it the white of a well-beaten egg, beating constantly 
while pouring it in. When smooth, spread on the cake 
while it is a little warm, and let dry. 

ORANGE ICING NO. i. 

Select a good, solid orange, wipe clean with a damp cloth, 
then roll it with the hands on a plate until the oil starts from 
the pores; then take a little granulated sugar in each hand and 
rub the orange until the sugar is filled with the oil. Take 
more sugar and so on until all of the oil is taken out of the 
orange. This gives the pure flavor of the orange without the 
bitter part of the rind. Add the sugar and the orange juice 
to the plain icing. 

ORANGE ICING NO. 2. 

When breaking the eggs for the cake, select the egg that 
has a very dark-colored yolk, as some yolks are a great deal 
darker than others. Beat this egg yolk until thick and 
foamy. Have ready I cup of sugar which has been boiled in 
3 tablespoonfuls of water until it will rope when dropped 
from the spoon. Pour it over the egg yolk, and beat it in; 
flavor with i tablespoonful of orange extract, or a little of the 
juice and grated rind of the orange. 

LEMON ICING. 

Take a lemon, and wipe it clean with a damp cloth, then 
roll it on a plate until the oil begins to exude from the pores. 
Now take some sugar in each hand and rub the lemon over 



3/8 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

with it until the flavor is extracted, changing the sugar as 
fast as it seems saturated with the oil. In this way you have 
the pure flavor of the lemon without the bitter white portion 
of the rind. If the color of lemon is desired, add a little of 
the tincture of saffron to the icing. Add the sugar and the 
juice of the lemon to the plain icing. When done, use 
at once. 

PLAIN ICING FOR CAKE. 

Sift 4 ounces of pulverized sugar, beat the white of i egg 
stiff, then gradually beat in the sugar, adding a little at a 
time until it forms a thick and smooth paste; when it is ready 
for use. 

ROSE ICING. 

Make the same as for plain icing, and then add i table- 
spoonful of rose-water. Rose-water harmonizes well with 
the flavor of almonds. If a pink color is desired, a table- 
spoonful of thick cranberry juice may be added; add with it 
more sugar. Confectioners use cochineal and carmine for 
coloring; but they are not to be recommended. 

GREEN ICING. 

Make a boiled frosting, and add enough of the green 
coloring (see index) to make the desired color, any flavoring 
desired may be added. This coloring is simple, and not at 
all injurious. 

YELLOW FROSTING. 

To the yolk of i egg add 9 heaping teaspoonfuls of pulver- 
ized sugar, and flavor with lemon, vanilla, or any flavoring 
desired. This is a nice frosting for a lemon cake, in which 
case it should be flavored with lemon. 



ICING. 379 



ALMOND FROSTING. 

Take ^ pound of almond butter, i tablespoonful of rose- 
water, | pound of pulverized sugar, and the whites of 3 eggs. 
Beat up the whites and sugar as directed for plain icing, 
then work in the almond butter. Spread it on the cake, let 
dry, and cover with a plain icing. 

SOFT ICING, 

Mix i pound of pulverized sugar with i tablespoonful of 
nut milk or any kind of fruit juice desired. Spread on the 
cake while warm about one-eighth of an inch in thickness and 
let dry. This is excellent for sponge cake, snow cake, etc. 

BOILED ICING. 

Take the whites of 3 eggs, and beat to a stiff froth. Place 
in a basin i cup of granulated sugar with 4 tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water. Boil briskly for five minutes or until it drops 
in threads from the spoon, then pour in a small stream on 
the beaten egg, beating constantly in order thoroughly to 
mix and cook all parts of the egg. A little cranberry juice 
may be added if a delicate pink frosting is desired; or if a 
yellow color is desired, grate the rind of an orange or lemon; 
add a very little of the juice, and squeeze through a thin cloth. 
Chopped almonds or hickory-nuts may be added. 

FROSTING WITHOUT EGGS. 

Dissolve i heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch in a very 
little water, placing the dish in a pan of hot water; add a 
little hot water, and let cook until very thick. While the 
starch is hot, stir in if- cups of sifted sugar. Flavor with any 



3<SO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

flavoring desired, and spread on the cake while the cake is 
yet warm. This cake should be made the day before using, 
as it takes longer for the frosting to dry than where eggs 
are used. 

QUICKLY MADE ICING. 

Take i teaspoonful of water or any kind of fruit juice, and 
dissolve in it all the powdered sugar it will take up, or until 
very thick; then spread over the cake. It will not be very 
thick, but it is nice for light cakes, such as sponge cake, etc. 



DRINKS. 



THE system requires from three to four quarts of water 
each day, but this should be taken either one hour before 
meals or three hours after eating. Drinking at meal-time 
dilutes the gastric juice of the stomach, and hinders the proc- 
ess of digestion. A great many people have formed the 
habit of drinking while they eat. Thus the food is moistened 
with drinks, and the saliva almost ceases to flow. It is then 
very difficult to get the salivary glands to secrete enough 
saliva to moisten the food sufficiently for swallowing ; but if 
a dry diet is persisted in long enough, the saliva will flow in 
sufficient quantities, and drinks will not be desired. 

If anything of a liquid nature is taken at meal-time, it 
should be something warm, as cold drinks have to call upon 
the system to warm them, and they stop all digestion until the 
stomach has again reached its normal temperature. People 
who are strong and healthy might not feel the evil effects 
of this at once, but those who are feeble, and those having 
small vitality, will soon weaken under this continual abuse of 
nature. 

Following are a few recipes for beverages to take the 
place of tea, coffee, and other injurious drinks, until the 
system is weaned from their use, and then little by little the 
substitute can be given up, until the salivary glands have 
learned to do their work so well that no drink will be required 
at meal-time.

PEANUT AND CEREAL COFFEE. 

Take i cup of coarsely ground peanuts, 2 cups of wheat 
bran, .\ cup of corn-meal, I cup of malt dissolved in \ cup of 
boiling water. Mix all together, and bake in the oven to a 
nice brown. 

CEREAL COFFEE. 

To 3 cups of wheat bran add i cup of corn-meal. Then 
take \ cup 'of malt extract, and dissolve in \ cup of boiling 
water, and pour over the bran and corn-meal after they have 
been thoroughly mixed. Mix well, and bake in the oven until 
a nice dark brown. Use i level ta.blespoonful to i cup of 
coffee. Cook slowly fifteen minutes. 

PEANUT COFFEE NO. J. 

Look over the peanuts, rejecting all the poor ones and 
foreign substances, and roast in the roaster or oven until they 
are a dark brown, about the color of Java coffee when roasted. 
Remove the skins, as they will make it bitter ; grind, but not 
too fine. Use the same as any coffee. 

PEANUT COFFEE NO. 2. 

Make like the above, and then add i tablespoonful of malt 
extract to ^ cup of water. When thoroughly dissolved, add 
to i quart of ground peanuts, and dry in the oven. 

CHUFA COFFEE. 

Take some good chufas, or earth almonds, wash them 
well, and bake in the oven or roast in a peanut roaster until 
quite brown, but not burned. Grind in a coffee-mill, but not 
very fine, then use the same as any coffee. (See article on 
Chufas.) 



DRINKS. 383 

BRAZIL-NUT COFFEE. 

Roast the kernels of the Brazil-nut to a nice brown ; when 
cold, pound or grind to a coarse meal. Use I heaping table- 
spoonful to i pint of water. Simmer gently for one hour. 

BUTTERNUT COFFEE. 

Put butternut kernels on a pie-tin, and bake in the oven 
until they are nicely browned, but not scorched. When cold, 
mash them to a meal with a cup or glass bottle on the tin, 
and use i tablespoonful for 2 cups of coffee. It is rich, and 
has the best flavor of all coffee substitutes. 

WALNUT COFFEE. 

Roast the walnut kernels in the same way as for but- 
ternut coffee, and use the same quantity for making the 
coffee. 

Pecans and hickory-nuts may be used in the same way, 
and are very nice. 



SALADS 



LETTUCE SALAD. 

STRAIN i pint of tomatoes, and put on stove to heat. 
When boiling, take a little of the hot juice and I 
tablespoonful of nut butter, and work together until creamy. 
Then stir into the tomatoes. Lastly add i heaping table- 
spoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water, with 
salt to taste. Cook in a double boiler. Pour this preparation 
while hot over the lettuce, meanwhile stirring the leaves with 
a fork. 

SALAD DRESSING. 

Take 3 eggs, i cup of nut cream, | cup of lemon-juice, 
\ tablespoonful of sugar, and i teaspoonful of salt. Beat 
the eggs, and put all together in a small double boiler, and 
cook until thickened, stirring continually in order to have it 
smooth. If too thick, thin it with hot water. This dress- 
ing may- be used on lettuce or any salad ; and such additions 
may be made to the body of the salad in the way of chopped 
celery, sliced hard-boiled eggs, or celery salt, as desired. 

NUTMEATOSE SALAD NO. J. 

To each half pound of nutrneatose, cut in small slices, 
add a dressing made of \ cup of nut cream, ^ cup of slightly 
diluted lemon-juice, i egg, i teaspoonful of sugar, and i tea- 
spoonful of salt. Beat the whites and yolks separately, then 

[384] 



SALADS. 385 

mix them. Pour slowly over them the heated mixture of 
sugar, salt, and lemon-juice, stirring rapidly all the time. 
Add lastly the cream, and heat until it thickens. 



NUTMEATOSE SALAD NO. 2. 

Take good firm nutmeatose, cut it in small slices, and 
cook in a double boiler for an hour or more, then drain off the 
liquid, and pour the nutmeatose into the salad dish. 

Make a dressing by rubbing smooth the yolks of 4 hard- 
boiled eggs, with i teaspoonful of peanut oil or any oil 
desired, i teaspoonful of salt, and the juice of i lemon, diluted 
with enough water to make i cupful. It is best to mince 
some celery very fine, and distribute among the pieces of 
nutmeatose without breaking the nutmeatose. Then pour 
over it the dressing. The liquid in which the nutmeatose 
was cooked can be used instead of water if desired. 



MOCK SALMON SALAD. 

Take i cup of nut butter, | cup of strained tomatoes, i 
cup of water, i cup of corn-starch, and salt to suit the taste. 
Cook in a steamer three or four hours. Use the same dress- 
ing over this as for nutmeatose salad. 

**> 

| WATERCRESS SALAD. 

Carefully wash some fresh watercress, break them in about 
one-inch lengths, and dry them with a clean towel; then place 
them in the dish in which they are to be served, and pour 
over them i teaspoonful of peanut oil mixed with lemon- 
juice; then dust with salt. Dandelions and oyster-plant can 

be served in the same way.

ARTICHOKE. 



Slice cold boiled artichoke without breaking the slices; 
arrange them in a dish, and pour over them a plain salad 
dressing made of 2 tablespoonfuls of peanut oil and I table- 
spoonful of lemon-juice, with a little salt. 




MOCK CHICKEN SALAD. 

MOCK CHICKEN SALAD. 

Take 3 cups of nutmcato which has been cut into very 
small cubes, and i .\ cups of celery after it has been chopped 
or cut very fine, using the tender white leaves and only the 
tender part of the stocks. Mix them well together, and keep 
upon the plate or platter on which it is to be served, 
squeezing over it the juice of half a lemon. Then make a 
dressing as follows:- 



SALADS. 



Take i heaping tablespoonful of almond butter (an equal 
amount of pine-nut butter is as good) dissolved in | cup of hot 
water, and \ cup of lemon-juice, place in a basin on the 
stove, and stir until it boils; then add I teaspoonful of corn- 
starch which has been rubbed in a very little water. Let it 
boil a minute, and pour slowly over the whites of 2 eggs 
which have been beaten to a stiff froth; beat while stirring in 
the hot gravy, and it will cook the egg sufficiently. Then 
pour while hot over the salad. In the accompanying cut the 
salad is garnished with celery leaves and slices of lemon. 
Serve cold, sending a piece of lemon with each dish of 
salad. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

Take ripe, solid, meaty tomatoes, cut in slices one-half inch 
thick, and place in the dish in which they are to be served; rub 
the yolk of i hard-boiled egg with i tablespoonful of lemon- 
juice, i of nut butter or nut oil, and i teaspoonful of sugar, 
and salt to suit the taste, until it is smooth; then heat to 
boiling, and pour over i well-beaten egg, stirring well as you 
pour it in. Turn this dressing over the sliced tomatoes. 
Serve cold. 

TURNIP SALAD. 

Select good, crisp turnips, peel, and with a sharp knife 
cut into cubes by cutting first one way a certain distance - 
about one-half inch - - and then across those cuts the same 
distance apart; then slice one-half inch thick, and the little 
cubes will fall on the dish. Stew about an hour, or until 
tender. When cold, pile into a dish garnished with lettuce, 
sprinkle with nut meal, celery salt, and lemon-juice. The 
celery salt may be omitted if desired. 



^SS GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

\J 

BEET SALAD. 

Cook blood beets until perfectly tender, then cut into 
small cubes, and pile them upon a salad dish which has been 
lined with lettuce leaves. Pour over the center a salad 
dressing as given under Butternut Sandwiches; but leave a 
ring of the beets that has no dressing on it, as the red beets 
are so pretty contrasted with the yellow dressing. 

NUTORA SALAD. 

Take some tomato nutora (see page 88), and cut it 
into small cubes. Select some good crisp, white celery, and 
slice the tender part of the stock very thin, having about I 
cup of the sliced celery for 2 cups of the nutora; carefully 
mix them together, and heap upon a salad dish. Then 
make a salad dressing by heating I teaspoonful of nut butter 
dissolved in I cup of water and J cup of lemon-juice to boil- 
ing, and pour while hot over a well-beaten egg. Put it in 
the inner part of a double boiler, and cook it until it is 
creamy, stirring constantly, then pour around the edge of 
the salad, leaving some in the center on which there is no 
dressing, as the cubes of nutora mixed with the white moon- 
shaped pieces of celery are very pretty. Garnish the salad 
with slices of nutora of peanuts (see page 85) which has been 
cooked in small cans. Bank the edge of the plate with 
parsley; and, if desired, a central garnish may be made by 
cutting the ends from a lemon, inserting some parsley leaves, 
and placing it in the center of the dish. (See cut on opposite 
page.)

TOASTS. 



COASTS are foods well calculated for breakfast, as they 
1 can be made in a short time, and the material prepared 
the day before. 

Toasted bread or zwieback should be made of good light 
bread, white, graham, or whole-wheat, cut in slices about two 
thirds of an inch thick. Stale bread is better, as the zwie- 
back made from it will be more brittle and crisp. Sour or 
heavy bread will not make zwieback. Place in a warming 
oven until quite well dried through, and then bake in a 
moderate oven until a nice light brown clear through. New 
or moist bread baked in a hot oven will render it so tough and 
hard that it will be almost impossible to eat it. Bread that 
is toasted only on the surface is as injurious as new bread, 
for the central part of the slice is just like new bread. When 
toasted bread is mentioned in the following recipes, that 
which has been toasted clear through is meant. Most of the 
toasts given under this head are excellent foods for the sick, 
being at the same time something to please the eye, palate, 
and stomach. 

APPLE TOAST. 

Take 6 good-sized tart apples; pare, core, and cook in as 
little water as possible until very tender. Stir often when 
nearly done to keep from burning, and to dry them out. 
Remove from the stove, and sift through a sieve; add sugar 
to taste, and beat until it is light and filled with -air bubbles. 
Reheat, and moisten slices of zwieback by dipping them into 



39 2 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

a dish of hot water and immediately removing them. Place 
the toast on individual pie plates, and cover with the hot 
sifted apple. Serve at once. 

ASPARAGUS TOAST. 

Moisten slices of zwieback in hot nut milk, and put on 
them a sauce made like the recipe for asparagus with egg 
sauce. (See index.) 

APPLE FOAM TOAST. 

Moisten slices of zwieback, and cover with an apple foam 
sauce. (See recipe for Apple Foam 

BANANA TOAST. 

Select nice, ripe bananas, and press through a fruit press 
or mash with a silver fork. Add a very little sugar, and serve 
on moistened zwieback. The bananas can be heated after 
they are mashed, if desired. 

BANANA FOAM TOAST. 

Moisten nicely browned slices of toast, and cover with a 
sauce made like recipe for Banana Foam. (See index.) 

CELERY TOAST. 

Take nicely browned slices of zwieback, and moisten by 
dipping into hot water and removing at once. Place on pie 
plates, and cover with a celery gravy made according to 
recipe. (See index.) 

CRANBERRY TOAST. 

Wash, and cook some cranberries in a very little water ; 
when done, put through a sieve to remove the skins, which 
are hard of digestion. Add enough sugar to sweeten, and 



TOASTS. 393 

heat again to boiling, and pour over slices of white zwieback, 
which have been moistened by dipping into hot water. The 
acid of the cranberry does not seem so sharp if a tablespoon- 
ful of almond butter is added to each pint of the cranberries. 

DATE TOAST. 

Pull the dates apart, and pour over them boiling water, 
shake in the dish for a few minutes to remove the dirt, and 
then drain. Pour on cold water, and when cool, drain again, 
and wipe with a clean towel. Some people are afraid to wash 
dates for fear they will melt or lose some of their goodness, 
but this is a mistake ; though they are soft, they have a tough 
skin that will not admit the water. Then grind them through 
the nut-butter mill. To i cup of the ground dates add 2 cups 
of hot water, and put 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls on well-moistened 
slices of zwieback. 

DRIED APPLE TOAST. 

Wash the dried apples well, and soak in lukewarm water 
for two hours, then stew slowly until very tender, and beat 
smooth or put through a colander. Sweeten to taste, and 
season with the oil and juice of a lemon, or a little grated 
lemon peel. Serve on slices of zwieback dipped into hot 
nut milk. 

EGG TOAST NO. J. 

Pour boiling water into a spider or shallow dish, and place 
it on the stove where it will keep just below the boiling-point. 
Break in a saucer as many eggs as there are pieces of toast, 
slip them into the hot \vater, and let them cook, but not 
boil, until the whites are well set. Have ready some slices of 
zwieback, moisten them in hot nut milk, skim out the eggs, 
and place one on each slice of toast. Salt a little, and serve 
hot. 



394 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

EGG TOAST NO. 2. 

Put some nut milk in a basin on the stove to heat ; take I 
egg for each slice of toast. Separate the whites and yolks, 
and beat the whites to a stiff froth, adding a little salt. Then 
dip nice slices of zwieback into the hot nut milk, which should 
be salted just a little ; place on a pie-tin, place the beaten 
whites on the toast, making a hole in the center, in which 
put the yolk of the egg. Place in a moderate oven until 
slightly brown. Serve at once. 

EGG TOAST NO. 3. 

Beat i egg until smooth, add a pinch of salt, and .j cup 
of nut cream. Dip into it well-toasted bread (zwieback), 
covering all sides with the egg ; then roll them in bread- 
crumbs, grated fine. Place on oiled tins, and bake in a 
moderate oven for ten minutes. Serve dry, or with hot 
nut milk. 

FIG TOAST. 

Look over and wash in hot water enough figs to cover 
toast for the family. For a family of five, take A pound of 
figs, grind them through the nut-butter mill, having it ad- 
justed tight enough to grind the seeds to a flour ; add 2 cups 
of hot nut milk, stirring until it is smooth. Put a spoonful 
or two on nice slices of zwieback which have been moistened 
by dipping into hot nut milk. 

GRAVY TOAST. 

Make a gravy as directed for nut gravy. (See index.) 
To each pint of the gravy add \ cup of sugar and ^ teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla. Place a few spoonfuls of it on well-moistened 
slices of zwieback. 



TOASTS. 395 

FRUIT TOAST. 

Heat i pint of grape juice or juice of other stewed fruit, 
such as strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, etc., until boil- 
ing, and sweeten to taste. Thicken to the desired consistency 
with corn-starch rubbed smooth in a litttle cold water, and 
cook one hour in a double boiler. Have ready some zwieback 
which has been soaked in some hot water or fruit juice, 
place in a saucer, and put on 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of the 
prepared fruit, and serve hot. This is a most desirable and 
wholesome breakfast dish. 

LEMON TOAST. 

Take some nicely toasted zwieback. If you wish it very 
nice, cut light white bread in slices about one-half inch thick, 
and cut them in rounds with a large cooky-cutter, and toast in 
a very slow oven until dry clear through, and of a light brown 
on the outside. Take the oil of a lemon (see directions for 
lemon syrup), and make a thin batter with a little of this 
sugar, i egg, 2 cups of milk, and flour to make of the right 
consistency. Dip each round of toast into this batter, coat- 
ing it on both sides; place on oiled tins, sift over all a little 
pulverized sugar, and bake for ten minutes in a moderate 
oven. This can be served with or without a dressing of 
nut cream. 

LENTIL TOAST. 

Cook lentils until perfectly tender, and rub through a 
colander. To i pint of sifted lentils add } 2 cup of nut cream 
and a little salt. If too thick, add more nut cream; but if 
too thin, thicken with a little flour rubbed smooth in cold 
water. Put a few spoonfuls of this lentil dressing on mois- 
tened slices of zwieback. 



396 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

MALT TOAST. 

Take a nice piece of graham or whole-wheat zwieback, 
dip it into hot nut milk, place it in a warm dish in which it is 
to be served, and spread over it the following: i tablespoon- 
ful of malt extract and i tablespoonful of nut cream, mixed 
thoroughly together. This is enough for only i slice of 
toast. 

NUT-BUTTER TOAST. 

Take some nicely toasted zwieback and place in a moder- 
ate oven to reheat. Have ready some peanut butter which 
has been diluted by adding an equal quantity of slightly 
salted hot water. Spread on the toast while very hot, and 
serve at once. This is excellent for those who desire a 
dry diet. 

PEACH TOAST. 

Take canned peaches, or fresh ones, and stew them. Put 
through a sieve or colander, sweeten to taste, reheat, thicken 
with a little white flour; let boil a few minutes, and serve on 
moistened slices of zwieback. 

NUT FOAM TOAST. 

Make a nut gravy of raw peanut milk, and sweeten to 
taste; then take the whites of two eggs and beat to a stiff 
froth, so that the dish can be inverted without the mixture 
falling out. Pour the hot nut gravy over the beaten whites 
of the eggs, beating all the time to keep it from cooking in 
lumps. If the gravy is boiling hot, it will cook the whites of 
the eggs sufficiently. Then moisten nicely toasted zwieback 
in hot water or hot nut milk, and cover with a gravy. 
Serve at once. 



TOASTS. 397 

PRUNE TOAST. 

Wash the prunes, and cook slowly until tender, then rub 
through a colander. If it is too thin, thicken with a little 
corn-starch or flour. Add I tablespoonful of sugar and ^ 
teaspoonful of vanilla to each pint of sifted prunes. Take 
fresh zwieback, dip the slices into hot water, taking them 
out immediately, place them in the dish in which they are 
to be served, and put 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls on each slice 
of toast. Serve hot. 

RAISIN TOAST. 

Take a little almond meal that has been thoroughly dried, 
and run it through the nut-butter mill, grinding it into butter; 
then look over and wash ^ pound of raisins, seed them, and 
grind through the mill. Add to the raisins I tablespoonful 
of the almond butter and \ cup of hot water. Heat on the 
stove to the boiling-point, and pour this over nice slices of 
zwieback which have been moistened by dipping into hot 
water. 

TOMATO TOAST NO. J. 

Moisten slices of well-toasted bread in hot water, and 
serve with the following dressing: Select good, ripe tomatoes, 
pour over them boiling water, let stand a minute or two, 
then drain, and rub off the skins. Cut a slice from the blow 
end, and with the finger remove all the seeds; then cut in 
small pieces, and cook to a mush. If they do not boil to 
pieces, rub through a sieve or colander. To i pint of the 
stewed tomatoes add \ cup of peanut cream, thicken with I 
tablespoonful of corn-starch or flour, and pour over the 
moistened toast. 



39 1 ^ GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

TOMATO TOAST NO. 2. 

Make a nut gravy according to recipe No I. (See index.) 
For i pint of this gravy, select i medium-sized tomato, 
remove the the skins and seeds, and cut the flesh in very 
small pieces, rejecting any part that may be hard or green, 
and add to the gravy. Let boil slowly for a few minutes, and 
serve on moistened slices of zwieback. For people who do 
not like a strong tomato flavor, this is better than the pre- 
ceding recipe. 

FRENCH TOAST. 

Cut slices of bread, and dip them in a cream made of 3 
eggs, i cup of nut cream, and a little salt. Brown on a soap- 
stone, or roll in meal and pine-nut butter, and brown in the 
oven. 

PARCHED ALMOND BROTH TOAST. 

Blanch some sweet almonds, and put them in the oven to 
toast to a nice light brown. When they get perfectly cool, 
grind them to a butter. Take i heaping teaspoonful to i 
pint of water and a pinch of salt; let it steep for half an hour 
or longer, then pour over slices of zwieback. 

The parched pine-nuts may be used in the same way, and 
make an equally good toast. 

Try other nuts in the same way. 

SUNSHINE TOAST. 

Select some good, ripe yellow tomatoes (the pear tomato is 
very good); heat and sift through a colander to remove the 
skins and seeds. To i pint of the sifted tomato add one 
tablespoonful of white flour and i heaping teaspoonful of 



TOASTS. 399 

peanut butter dissolved in a little water; add salt to suit the 
taste. Pour while hot over slices of zwieback which have 
been moistened with a little hot water. 

DRY BUTTER TOAST. 

Take nicely toasted bread, which has been toasted on the 
soapstone or in the oven. Spread with fresh nut butter that 
has not been diluted, place in the oven for a few minutes, 
and serve very hot. 

ZWIEOLA. 

Take 2\ pounds or 8 cups of white flour, A pound or 2^ 
cups of rolled oats, 2 ounces or \ cup of corn-meal. Mix the in- 
gredients thoroughly, adding a little salt if desired, and wet 
with enough cold water to make a very stiff dough. Roll out 
into crackers about one fourth of an inch thick, score across 
the top into small squares, and bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour, or until dry and crisp clear through. Break the 
crackers into small pieces ; grind in an ordinary grain- or 
coffee-mill, or can be ground in nut-butter mill loosely ad- 
justed. This and the following recipe are splendid health 
foods. Don't fail to try them. 

MALTED NUT ZWIEOLA. 

Take 8 cups of white flour, 2\ cups of rolled oats, \ cup of 
corn-meal, 2 cups of peanut meal, with enough water to make 
a very stiff dough, and proceed as with the above recipe. 
When baked and ground to a coarse meal, add \ cup of malt, 
diluted in \ cup of hot water, to about i quart of the ground 
zwieola ; mix, and dry in a slow oven. When dry, grind 
again. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



OICK people usually have but very little appetite, and all 
O that can be done in presenting the food in a neat and 
dainty way, making it attractive to the eye as well as to the 
smell and taste, will be appreciated. The napkins should be 
of snowy whiteness, the dishes the best the house affords, and 
as neatly arranged as possible. Avoid loading the tray with 
either too great a variety or too much of one thing. It is 
always better to have too little than too much. 



DRINKS. 

A REFRESHING DRINK. 

Take i cup of seeded raisins, i cup of cranberries, and 3 
pints of water. Boil for half an hour. Sweeten to suit the 
taste. Strain and let cool. 

ALMOND MILK. 

Take i tablespoonful of almond butter, and dissolve it in I 
pint of hot water; when boiling, stir in .\ teaspoonful of white 
flour rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Let it boil a 
minute or two, and strain through a fine muslin cloth. Serve 
cold or hot as preferred.

APPLE WATER. 

Take I large, juicy apple (the pippin is the best 
flavored), pare and quarter, but do not core. Put it into a 
stew kettle with 3 cups of cold water, and cook slowly until 
the apple is cooked to pieces, then strain through a coarse 
bag, pressing it some. Strain through a finer bag, sweeten to 
taste, and cool for drinking. This is an excellent drink for 
invalids in hot weather. 

BERRY WATER. 

Take strawberries, or raspberries, or any berries desired; 
put them in a stout but coarse muslin bag, and mash with a 
wooden potato masher, squeezing out all the juice possible. 
Strain through a fine muslin cloth, and dilute with an equal 
quantity of water. A little sugar may be added if desired. 

CHERRY WATER. 

Select good, ripe cherries, the sweet varieties are the 
best; pit them; put them in a stew-pan, and boil a few min- 
utes in a little water, then strain through a muslin jelly-bag, 
and let stand to cool until ready to use; take ^ glass of the 
juice, and fill the glass with cold sterilized water. Canned 
cherries are just as good. 

CURRANT WATER. 

Take some good, ripe currants, pick from the stems, and 
wash well. Put them in a strong muslin bag, and pound 
with a wooden potato masher until all the currants are bro- 
ken, then squeeze out all the juice. For making the currant 
water, take i cup of currant juice and ^ cup of water; add a 
little sugar, and serve cold.

4O2 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

HOT WATER. 

If clean, soft water can be obtained, it is the best; but 
never use cistern water. Put in a graniteware or a porce- 
lain-lined kettle. Let it boil up quickly, and take from the 
stove at once. Too much boiling causes the air in the water 
to escape, and makes it have a flat taste. 

COLD LEMONADE. 

Squeeze the juice from a medium-sized lemon, and add 2 
tablespoonfuls of sugar to the juice; stir until the sugar is 
pretty well dissolved, then add I pint of very cold sterilized 
water. This is excellent to give in cases of fever, but should 
not be given at meal-time, for the acid of the lernon prevents 
the digestion of the starch. 

HOT LEMONADE. 

Take 2 medium-sized lemons, peel just thick enough to 
remove the yellow portion, but not to cause the juice to run 
out. Cut in halves, and squeeze out the juice; strain through 
a fine wire sieve or fine muslin cloth to remove every seed 
and small particles of the white fiber, which would cause it to 
be bitter, then add 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar and I pint of 
boiling water, and serve at once. 

If the lemon is squeezed without the yellow rind being 
pared, some of the oil of the rind may get into the juice, 
and cause it to be bitter. 

This is an excellent drink to break up a cold or fever 
when it first starts. Take a thorough enema, soak the feet 
in hot water for fifteen or twenty minutes, drink 3 glasses of 
hot lemonade, and go to bed. In the morning take a tepid 
bath, and be well. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 403 

RICE WATER. 

Boil ^ cup of rice in 2 quarts of water for one and one- 
half hours. Rice, when boiled for a long time, will become 
a jelly, and is slightly constipating in its nature. To each 
glass of the water, add i teaspoonful of currant jelly, or any 
fruit jelly desired. 

PINEAPPLEADE. 

Take I cup of sugar, put in a granite stew-kettle with I 
pint (2 cups) of water, let it boil until it forms a thin syrup, 
removing the scum as fast as it rises ; meantime, pare a ripe 
pineapple quite thin, and with a sharp-pointed knife remove 
all the eyes, grate into a bowl, add to the syrup, let it boil 
for ten or fifteen minutes, and cool. Add more water, strain 
and use. 

SLIPPERY-ELM TEA. 

Take a few small pieces of slippery-elm bark, and pour 
over them some cold water. Place on the stove, and let them 
cook a few minutes ; then strain and use, hot or cold. Add 
lemon-juice if desired. 



GRUELS. 

CORN-MEAL GRUEL. 

Take I quart of water, 2 tablespoonfuls of corn-meal, I 
tablespoonful of white flour, and a little salt and nut cream. 
Rub the corn-meal and flour smooth in a little cold water, 
and pour it slowly into the boiling water, then add a little salt 
and nut cream. Put into a double boiler, and cook for three 
hours. If too much of the water boils away, more should be 
added. 



44 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

GRAHAM GRUEL. 

Take 4 cups of water, I cup of graham flour, and i table- 
spoonful of almond meal. Rub the flour smooth in i cup of 
the water, and heat the other 3 cups to boiling, stirring in the 
flour slowly; then stir in the almond meal, and cook in a 
double boiler for one hour or more. Salt may be added to 
the water if desired. 

GROUND RICE GRUEL. 

Put into the inner cup of a double boiler 3 cups of water, 
just a little salt, i tablespoonful of almond meal (see index 
for directions), and i tablespoonful of ground rice. Let it 
come to a boil, and then place in the double boiler, the water 
in which should be boiling, and cook for one hour. If de- 
sired, a few raisins may be added ; they give it a flavor which 
improves it. 

PLAIN GLUTEN GRUEL. 

To i pint of boiling water stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of glu- 
ten, boil until it thickens, salt slightly, and serve at once. 
Gluten is already cooked, so it does not need prolonged 
cooking. 

ALMOND GLUTEN GRUEL. 

To the plain gluten gruel add 2 level tablespoonfuls of 
almond meal ; put in a double boiler, and cook for fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Peanuts, hazelnuts, or any nut meal may 
be used instead of the almonds, if desired. 

GLUTEN EGG GRUEL. 

Make a thin, gluten gruel, because the egg will thicken it 

somewhat. Beat the egg smooth, and pour the hot gruel 

over the egg, beating all the time to have it thoroughly 
mixed before cooking. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 405 

GLUTEN GRUEL WITH RAISINS. 

To i pint of water which should be boiling, add 2 level 
tablespoonfuls of gluten rubbed smooth in a little cold water, 
a little salt, and | cup of seedless or seeded raisins which 
have been washed and soaked for one hour or more. Cook 
in a double boiler or on the back part of the stove for ten or 
fifteen minutes. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Into i quart of boiling water stir I cup of rolled oats, let 
it boil until it will not settle when lifted from the stove, then 
place in a double boiler, and cook three hours. When done, 
sift through a sieve. Add a little salt and nut cream, either 
almond or peanut, and serve hot. 

NUT GRUEL. 

Blanch ^ cup of almonds and ^ cup of peanuts, and put 
them to cook in soft water. Let boil slowly until perfectly 
tender, then rub through a sieve. It will take three or four 
hours for them to cook. Add to them \ cup of zwieback, 
grated fine, a very little salt, and enough water to make of 
the consistency of gruel. This is a very palatable and nutri- 
tious dish for the sick. 

WHITE FLOUR GRUEL. 

Take i pint of nut milk, put in an inner cup of a double 
boiler; when boiling, stir in i level tablespoonful of white 
flour, which has been rubbed smooth in a little cold water. 
Season with a little salt and nutmeg or vanilla. ,A very little 
sugar may be added, if desired.

FRUIT. 

Fruits are the most simple and easily digested of all 
foods; they contain a great deal of water, and are therefore 
very useful as food in fever cases. They also contain acids 
that are antiseptic in nature. The raw fruit, if thoroughly 
ripe and perfectly sound, can be eaten with relish and with- 
out injury by most invalids. 

BAKED SWEET APPLES. 

Select good sweet apples (the Talrnan Sweets are the best 
sweet winter apples), wash thoroughly, remove the blow from 
the end, but let the stem remain, place on granite pie-tins, 
pour over them 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water, and bake in a 
moderate oven until very soft clear through. It will take 
one and one-half or two hours according to the size of the 
apple. Serve hot or cold. 

BAKED SOUR APPLES. 

Take good tart apples, but not those that are too acid; 
wash well, pull off the stem, and remove the core from the 
blow end by means of a sharp knife or new clothes-pin, then 
place them stem end down on a granite pie-tin, and bake until 
soft but not mushy. Have ready the white of an egg beaten 
to a stiff froth, and flavor with sugar and vanilla. Fill up the 
cavities in the apple with the frosting, and place the half of a 
walnut kernel on top. Place in the oven to brown lightly. 

BAKED PEARS. 

Select good, ripe pears, wash well, but do not pare, and 
with a sharp knife remove the core from the blow end; place 
in a granite pie-tin with a very little water, and bake in a 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 407 

moderate oven for two hours or until they are very soft clear 
through. If they are quite ripe, it will not take so long. When 
done, set them up on the stem end, and fill the holes with the 
white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth, sweetened with sugar 
and flavored with vanilla; then place a blanched and roasted 
almond upon the top of the frosting, return to the oven and 
let brown a trifle. Serve at once, or serve cold. 

STEWED PRUNES. 

Get good, sweet, California prunes, look over, wash, and 
soak in cool water overnight. In the morning, put into a 
granite stew-pan with enough cool water to cover them. Set 
them on the back part of the stove where they will cook 
gently for three or four hours, or until they are perfectly ten- 
der. They are very good without sugar, but a little may be 
added if desired. An excellent food in case of fevers and 
constipation. 

CRANBERRY AND SAGO JELLY. 

Take I pint of cranberries; wash, and put into a granite 
stew-pan, or cook in something which the acid of the berry 
will not affect, and cause the fruit to taste ; cover with cold 
water, and cook until the skins burst. Mash with a spoon, 
pour into a jelly-bag, and squeeze out the juice. To each 
pint of the juice add f cup of sugar and { cup of sago ; put 
on the stove, and let cook until the sago is transparent, then 
pour into cups to mold, and serve cold. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Take 2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, I pint of water, and 
boil very slowly for one hour, or until it becomes like jelly 
and transparent ; add sugar to suit the taste, and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of any fruit juice desired. Can be eaten hot, or 
molded and served cold.

MISCELLANEOUS. 

CHESTNUTS WITH RAISINS. 

Remove the chestnuts from the shells, and put on the stove 
in hot water, allowing them to boil until the skins are loose 
enough to rub off, which will be in about five minutes; then 
put on to cook in hot water, and when they are about half 
done, or in one hour, put in some well-washed raisins, and 
cook until the chestnuts are mealy; a little salt may also be 
added if desired. 

STEWED CHESTNUTS. 

Prepare the chestnuts as in the preceding recipe, and cook 
until mealy; then add a little vanilla, and to I pint of the 
chestnuts add I tablespoonful of malt ; heat and serve. 

MALT. 

Malt is especially adapted to those stomachs which can 
not digest starch. It is made from barley; the starch has 
been digested by the process through which it has gone. 
Take about i tablespoonful at each meal. It also may be 
mixed with other foods, as malted caramels, malted butter, 
etc. See directions for making elsewhere. 

BREAD FOR THE SICK. 

The unfermented breads and zwieback are the best, as 
they do not contain the yeast germs. Such breads as rolls, 
crisps, sticks, gems, and crackers are excellent. See direc- 
tions for making under Breads. 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 409 

Zwieback which has been thoroughly toasted, so that all 
the yeast germs are destroyed, granola, and granose are 
also good. 

EGG-NOG NO. J. 

Take i tumbler of cocoanut cream, add to it i teaspoon- 
ful of granulated sugar, the yolk of i egg, and beat with a 
fork until creamy. Beat the whites of an egg and a pinch of 
salt to a stiff froth, adding i teaspoonful of granulated sugar. 
Put two thirds of the beaten white in the tumbler with the 
other mixture and work together. Then put the remaining 
one third of the white on top and serve at once. 

EGG-NOG NO. 2. 

Take i medium-sized lemon, i tablespoonful of sugar, i 
perfectly fresh egg, \ glass of nut cream. Wash and scrape 
the lemon with a fork till all the oil cells are broken, then 
rub the sugar into it till it becomes quite yellow. Add half 
of this to the cream, yolk, and tablespoonful of juice, mixed 
together in a glass. Add the remaining of the sugar to the 
stiffly beaten white. Lastly stir two thirds of the white into 
the glass, and pile the remainder on top. 

ORANGE EGG-NOG. 

Beat the yolk of i egg and i tablespoonful of cold orange 
juice until stiff. Beat the white until it is frothy, but not 
stiff, and add the rest of the orange juice, and sugar to suit 
the taste, beating it until it is very stiff and crumbly. Fold 
it with the beaten yolks, put in a tumbler, and serve at once. 
A little of the orange oil may be added if desired. To ob- 
tain the oil, roll the orange on a plate or platter until the oil 
starts from the pores, then take a little granulated sugar in 



4IO GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

each hand, and rub the orange until the sugar is saturated 
with the oil ; then take more sugar and continue until the oil 
is all taken. Use the sugar, or a part of it, in sweetening 
the egg-nog. 

LEMON EGG-NOG. 

Proceed the same as with the orange egg-nog, using the 
juice of the lemon instead of the orange. As the lemon is 
very acid, a less quantity is needed--^ lemon would be suffi- 
cient. These dishes are excellent for the sick, who can not 
take much nourishment, but very little sugar should be used 
in them. 

FRUIT EGG-NOG. 

Beat the egg, without separating, until very stiff, then add 
the sugar, and beat again. Add the fruit juice (cranberry, 
strawberry, or any other kind of fruit desired), adding a little 
at a time, beating vigorously ; 2 tablespoonfuls for one egg is 
sufficient. 

SNOW EGG-NOG. 

Take the white of i egg, and beat until frothy ; then add 
i tablespoonful of sugar and i tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 
beating until it is dry and crumbly. Put in a tumbler, and 
serve at once. Orange juice may be used instead of the 
lemon if desired, or a little fruit juice, or vanilla. 

OTHER FOODS FOR THE SICK. 

Other foods, directions for which are given elsewhere, are 
also good for the sick. Most of the toasts given under that 
head can be used ; also the grains and puddings. 



CREAMS, ICES, ETC. 



ICE-CREAM NO. J. 

r PAKE i quart of nut cream, i cup of sugar, 3 eggs, and 
1 2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Beat the whites and yolks of 
the eggs separately, adding the sugar and yolks; then add the 
vanilla, the beaten whites, and lastly the nut cream. Freeze 
at once. 

ICE-CREAM NO. 2. 

Take i quart of rich nut cream, either almond or peanut. 
If made from peanuts, the nuts should not be roasted very 
brown, only a yellow color. Add i cup of granulated sugar, 
and 2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Turn the cream into a double 
boiler, and cook for twenty or thirty minutes. Add the sugar 
before cooking, then cook, and add the vanilla, and freeze. 

ICE-CREAM NO. 3. 

Take 3 pints of nut cream (made by adding \ cup of light 
nut butter to each pint of water), 3 eggs, 3 teaspoonfuls of 
corn-starch, i^ cups of sugar. Scald cream in a double 
boiler, add corn-starch, cook five minutes, take from the fire, 
add eggs and sugar beaten together, and flavor with i tea- 
spoonful of vanilla or lemon extract; cool and freeze. Add 
i pint of fruit, if desired. 

FRUIT ICE-CREAM. 

Make like recipe No. 3, and add i cup of mashed fruit to 
every quart of cream. If desired, the juice of the fruit only 
need be used. 



412 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

NUT ICE-CREAM. 

Make like recipe No. 3, and add 2 cups of nut meal made 
from walnuts, cocoanuts, or any other nut desired. 

ICE-CREAM MADE OF PEANUT MILK. 

Make the peanut milk by grinding the raw peanuts to a 
meal, but do not grind as fine as peanut butter ; then to 2 
cups of meal add 3 cups of water, and beat very thoroughly. 
Strain through two thicknesses of cheese-cloth, pressing out 
all the milk ; put the contents of the bag into a bowl, and 
pour on i^ cups of water, beat very thoroughly, and strain 
the second time. Take the milk thus obtained, and cook in 
a double boiler for two hours or more, add two well-beaten 
eggs to each quart of milk, 4 cup of sugar, i teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and salt to taste. Stir in the ingredients thoroughly, 
and remove from the stove ; put into a pan of cold water to 
cool. When cool, it is ready to freeze. 

ALMOND ICE-CREAM. 

Take ^ pound or f cup of almond butter, and dissolve in 
i^ quarts of cold water, then add a pinch of salt, 2 beaten 
eggs, and ^ teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat well together and 
freeze. Any flavoring may be added that suits the taste 
of the family, or if preferred, grated pineapple, strawberries, 
or any fruit desired may be added. 

ICE-CREAM OF HICKORY CREAM. 

Make the hickory cream as directed elsewhere, and to I 
quart of this cream add 2 well-beaten eggs, a pinch of salt, 
and sugar to suit the taste. Freeze without cooking. 



CREAMS, ICES, ETC. 413 

ICE-CREAM OF PINE-NUT MILK. 

Grind or mash the pine-nuts to a fine meal, and to each 
cup of the meal add 2 cups of cold or lukewarm water ; beat 
with a spoon, and press through two thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth. To each quart of this milk add 2 well-beaten eggs, a 
pinch of salt, sugar to suit the taste, and I teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Mix well, and freeze. The cream from any other 
nut may be made into ice-cream. 



WATER ICES. 

ORANGE ICE. 

Take 2 quarts of water, i quart of orange juice, and 2 
pounds of sugar. Melt the sugar in the water, letting it boil 
for a few moments, and removing the scum, if any rises. 
Then add the juice, and let it boil up once, again skimming, 
if necessary. When cold, put into a freezer, and turn until 
it is partly frozen. Remove the cover, scrape down the sides, 
and add a meringue made of the white of i egg beaten to 
a stiff froth, with i teaspoonful of finely powdered sugar. 
Work it in as smooth as possible, and then turn until frozen. 
The meringue keeps it from forming into granules, and makes 
it more like ice-cream. 

LEMON ICE. 

Take 3 quarts of water, i pint of lemon-juice, 2 pounds of 
sugar. 

Make the same as orange ice. 



4'4 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

PINEAPPLE ICE. 

Take 3 quarts of water, i\ pints of pineapple juice, and 
2 pounds of sugar. 

Make the same as orange ice. 

If desired, the cream of any nuts may be substituted for 
the water, but it then becomes an ice-cream. 



SHERBETS. 

Sherbets consist of the frozen juices of fruits without the 
addition of water. Usually a combination of fruit juices is 
employed. 

SHERBET NO. J. 

Take 2 quarts of peach pulp, i quart of orange juice, and 
2 pounds of sugar. 

Make the same as water ices, omitting the meringue. 

SHERBET NO. 2. 

Take 2 quarts of apple juice, i quart of orange juice, 2 
pounds of sugar. 

Make the same as orange ice, omitting the meringue. 
The pulp or juice of the strawberry, raspberry, cherry, 
currant, plum, grape, or any other fruit may be used in 
the same way. 



TO BLANCH NUTS. 



PEANUTS. 

T) OASTED peanuts are blanched quite easily. The best 
1 V and quickest method is with a blanching machine made 
for that purpose. But they can be blanched quite rapidly by 
rubbing them upon a sieve made of coarse wire, or they may 
be blanched by putting a few at a time in a coarse cloth or 
bag, and rubbing between the hands. The skins can then 
be removed by pouring from one dish into another and using 
an ordinary fan, or where the wind is blowing. There is a 
fan in the blanching machine, so when it is used the nuts are 
free from chaff as they come from the machine. 

ALMONDS. 

Almonds may be blanched by pouring over them boiling 
water, and letting them stand for a few minutes until the 
skins become loose. Then by pressing the nut between the 
thumb and ringer the kernel will jump out of its jacket. 

Some variety of almonds can be blanched by heating in 
the oven until they are hot, but not browned in the least. 
Set them in a cool, dry place; and when cold, the skins can be 
rubbed off the same as roasted peanuts. 

FILBERTS. 

Put the filberts on a tin in the oven, and let them get hot, 
but do not brown in the least. As soon as they get hot, the 

[415] 



4l GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

skins will begin to crack; then cool, and they will rub off 
easily. 

Do not roast the nuts, as roasting spoils the flavor. 

WALNUTS. 

Put the shelled walnuts on a tin in the oven just long 
enough to get hot. Then remove, and when cool, rub off the 
skins. They may also be blanched by putting in boiling 
water for a few minutes; but they can not be blanched so 
fast in this way. 

BUTTERNUTS. 

Remove from the sheU as whole as possible, and then 
place in the oven until they are heated through. When cool, 
the skins will rub off easily. 

Brazil-nuts can be blanched in the same way. 



TO SALT NUTS. 



PEANUTS NO. J. 

TAKE some peanuts that have been blanched and looked 
over, pour cold water over them, and drain. Tphen. 
place on granite pie-tins, sprinkle generously with fine table _.- 
salt, and bake in a moderate oven until they are perfectly 
dry and crisp. 

Peanuts that are not blanched can be salted in the 
same way. 

Peanuts that are salted in this way do not have the oily 
appearance that those do which have been salted the ordinary 
way, with butter; and they do not become rancid as soon. 

PEANUTS NO. 2. 

If it is desired to salt with the skins on, take them hot 
from the roaster or oven, and for each quart pour over ^ 
tablespoonful of nut oil; mix well that each kernel may be 
oiled on all sides, then sprinkle generously with salt, and 
mix again. 

If it is desired to have the nuts blanched before salting, 
they must be allowed to get cold after roasting, so that the 
skins can be easily removed. After looking over the nuts, 
pour over them i tablespoonful of hot nut oil. Mix well, and 
sprinkle on salt, and mix again. 

Nuts salted in this way, should be eaten as soon after 
salting as possible, or they will become rancid.

ALMONDS NO. J. 

Take some almonds that have been blanched, pour cold 
water over them, and drain. Then sprinkle with fine table 
salt, mix thoroughly, and bake to a nice straw color. 

ALMONDS NO. 2. 

Put blanched almonds in the oven, and toast to a nice 
straw color; remove from the oven, and while hot, pour over 
them i tablespoonful of nut oil for each quart of almonds. 
Mix well, and sprinkle with salt; mix again thoroughly, and 
when cool, serve. 

PINE-NUTS. 

Wash the nuts in water, drain, and sprinkle with salt, 
mixing it in well. Then place in the oven until they are 
toasted to a straw color. Toasting very much improves the 
taste of the pine-nut. 

FILBERTS. 

First blanch the filberts, then pour over them some cold 
water, and drain. Sprinkle generously with fine table salt, 
and after mixing well, place in the oven to dry, but do not 
brown in the least, as it hurts the flavor of the filbert to 
toast it. 

WALNUTS, HICKORY-NUTS, PECANS, 
BUTTERNUT, ETC 

These may be salted in the same way as other nuts, but 
toasting does not improve the taste of these nuts ; they should 
be placed in the oven only long enough to dry. 



CONFECTIONERY. 



TAFFY. 

TAKE 3 cups of very light brown sugar and I cup of water. 
Put into a dish which may be readily handled. A long- 
handled, granite stew-pan is most convenient. Stir until 
sugar is dissolved ; no longer, or it will grain. When nearly 
done, add I teaspoonful of lemon-juice and 2 tablespoonfuls 
of peanut oil. Test by dropping a little into a cup of cold 
water. If it hardens quickly and becomes brittle, it is done, 
and should be removed from the stove at once, lest it should 
become too stiff. Add a teaspoonful of vanilla extract, pour 
the mixture into shallow pans, previously oiled, and take to a 
cool place. When cooled sufficiently to allow handling, be- 
gin pulling. The more it is pulled, the lighter it becomes. 

PEANUT CANDY. 

Take i pound of sugar, and i pound of peanuts. Sugar 
should be granulated, although other kinds may be used. 
Melt the sugar by putting it into a granite or porcelain-lined 
kettle or basin, and heating, using care constantly to stir to 
prevent burning. While melting, it will turn to a brown 
color and then become creamy ; then add the blanched pea- 
nuts. Turn at once into an oiled tin or platter. If made as 
it should be, the candy will be brittle when cold. If the pea- 
nuts are salted before being added, better candy can be made.

42O GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

COCOANUT CREAM CARAMELS. 

Take 4 cups of Coffee A sugar, or light-brown sugar, and 
i cup of thin cocoanut cream. Stir for five minutes. Place 
on stove, and boil, not stirring after sugar has melted. Test 
by dropping a little into a cup of cold water. If it becomes 
thick enough to be worked between the fingers, like caramels, 
it has boiled enough. Just before removing from stove, flavor 
with vanilla, or any other extract desired. Pour into square 
tins, about half an inch in thickness. Cut into squares, and 
wrap in oiled paper. The candy, by being pulled like taffy, 
may be made a much lighter color and better in quality. 

HONEY CARAMELS. 

To 3 cups of light-brown, or 2\ cups of Coffee A sugar, 
add \ cup of cream, \ cup of hot water, and 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of strained honey. Mix well, and allow to boil without 
stirring. Test frequently, until a small amount, dropped into 
ice-water, will make a slight crackling sound by coming in 
contact with the cold water ; then add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and pour the mixture into an oiled pan. Before 
becoming very cool, cut into squares. 

PEANUT CREAM CARAMELS. 

Make like the cocoanut creams, substituting peanut cream 
and water in place of the cocoanut cream. If more water is 
added, and the mixture allowed to cook longer, the raw pea- 
nut taste is avoided. Flavor with vanilla or rose-water, and 
finish the candy the same as above recipe. 

CREAM NUTS. 

Take the white of i egg, i teaspoonful of cocoanut cream, 
i teaspoonful of vanilla, and i pound of pulverized sugar. 



CONFECTIONERY. 42 1 

Beat the white of the egg, add the vanilla, and beat again. 
Pour in the nut cream, and beat in part of the sugar; then 
take out the egg-beater, and knead in sufficient sugar to make 
the mixture mold well, taking care not to put in too much, 
lest it should become crumbly. Make into balls by rolling 
between the hands, and press the half of a walnut or pecan 
kernel into the top. Put into well-oiled tins, place in the 
oven, leaving the door open, and bake very slowly --long 
enough to cook the egg, but not to melt the sugar. 

CHOCOLATE DROPS. 

Shave a sufficient quantity of chocolate to make I cup, 
put in a basin, and set in a warm place until the chocolate 
melts. Add i teaspoonful of vanilla and i teaspoonful of 
water, mix well, and add i^ cups of pulverized sugar and i 
level tablespoonful of almond or pine-nut butter. 

ALMOND CREAMS. 

Work 2 tablespoonfuls of almond butter in pulverized sugar 
until it can be molded with the hands, when the mixture 
should be molded into cone-shaped drops and allowed to dry. 
Rose-water, vanilla, or any flavoring desired, may be added. 

Chocolate creams may be made in this manner by adding 
to the almond creams a coating of chocolate, which can be 
done by melting grated chocolate, and rolling the drops in it, 
after which place on oiled tins, and allow to dry. 

PEPPERMINT LOZENGES. 

Beat the white of i egg with i teaspoonful of water, until 
stiff; then beat in as much pulverized sugar as possible, and 
add 5 or 6 drops of peppermint oil. Sift some powdered 



4 2 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

sugar upon a marble slab or large platter, and knead well, 
adding more sugar, if needed. Roll out with a glass rolling- 
pin. A round glass bottle will do. Cut into small round- or 
square-shaped pieces, or roll into small balls. Place upon 
oiled tins, and set into an oven to dry, leaving the door open. 

WINTERGREEN LOZENGES. 

Make similar to the peppermint lozenges, substituting 
wintergreen for flavoring. The quantity required depends 
upon the strength of the wintergreen used. 

COCOANUT BISCUIT. 

Beat the white of I egg into a stiff froth. Stir in 1.1 
cups of pulverized sugar and all the shredded cocoanut that 
can be worked in. Form into small biscuits, and bake in a 
moderately heated oven until the upper part of the biscuit is 
a light-brown color. 

ALMOND MACAROONS. 

Take 3 eggs, I cup of sugar, i cup of almond or pine-nut 
butter. Beat the whites of the eggs into a froth, and add a 
little sugar, beating again. Add a little more sugar, beating 
continuously, and in this manner put in all the sugar. Then 
beat until the mixture becomes thick enough to allow being 
cut with a knife, like cake, after which gently fold in the 
almond meal, which is better if the almonds are toasted 
slightly before being ground. Then drop on buttered granite 
tins. Place in a moderately hot oven, leave one minute, then 
open door, and let dry. A glazed surface can be secured by 
brushing the macaroons with water. 



CONFECTIONERY. 423 

KISSES. 

Take | pound of sugar, 6 eggs, i pound of flour, i{ cups 
of almond meal, i pound of sifted flour, i grated nutmeg. 
Beat the whites and yolks separately into a stiff froth, add the 
sugar to the yolks, and beat in; then fold in the beaten 
whites, add the aLnond meal, nutmeg, and flour, folding in 
carefully. Drop upon oiled tins, and bake in moderate oven. 

HICKORY-NUT KISSES. 

Take the whites of 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of white flour, 
i cup of granulated sugar, and \ cup of hickory-nut meats. 
Beat the eggs stiff, adding the sugar a little at a time, and 
beating ; then fold in the nuts and flour, and drop in small 
teaspoonfuls on oiled tins, and bake. 

DATE DAINTIES. 

Select good whole dates, pick them apart carefully so as 
not to mash them, then pour boiling water on them, shaking 
for a minute; drain, and pour over them cold water, and drain 
again. Then with a sharp knife cut open one side lengthwise, 
and remove the pit, filling its place with nut butter or any 
kind of nut; close it together, and roll in pulverized sugar. 

SALTED ALMONDS. 

Remove the almonds from the shell, blanch them, and 
place in the oven to get thoroughly dry; then to each pint of 
nuts use i tablespoonful of nut oil of any kind desired, mix 
well with the nuts so that all sides of the almonds may 
become well oiled, then sprinkle with salt, and bake in the 
oven until they are very crisp and slightly browned; then 
they are ready to serve. 



4-4 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

SALTED PINE-NUTS. 

Take 2 cups of pine-nuts, I tablespoonful of pine-nut 
oil ( or any nut oil desired ), mix well, sprinkle with salt, 
and put in the oven to toast slightly. If desired, a little 
sugar may be used instead of the salt. 

ROASTED CHESTNUTS. 

Put some chestnuts on a roll-baker in a hot oven, and 
bake them until the kernels are a light brown. They can be 
roasted on top of a wood stove, if they are carefully watched 
and turned over to keep them from scorching. The raw 
chestnuts contain seventy per cent, of starch, and should be 
cooked in some way before they are eaten. 



MENUS. 



A MISTAKE that is very common among people, espe- 
cially those who are well-to-do, is having too great a 
variety at one meal. "It would be better to eat only three 
or four different kinds of foods at each meal than to load the 
stomach with many varieties. " But there should often be a 
change in the menu. "The cook should tax her inventive 
powers to vary the dishes she prepares for the table, and the 
stomach should not be compelled to take the same kinds of 
food meal after meal." In order to be proficient in her work, 
the cook should understand enough of physiology to be 
informed upon all points that pertain to digestion, as well as 
upon the nutritive value of foods, their digestibility, and the 
time each takes for digestion. If she does not understand 
these, she should consult the Dietetic Table in the back part 
of this book, before making out a menu. 

The system requires from one sixth to one seventh as 
much albuminous elements as carbonaceous, and care should 
be taken to have foods which contain these elements. For 
example : rice is nearly all starch; then when rice is served, 
something that has an abundance of the albuminous element 
should be served at the same meal ; as beans, peas, or some 
form of nuts. 

Wheat, and most of the other grains, contain both ele- 
ments in the right proportion ; also some fruits, as the 
strawberry, etc. 

The combination of foods should also be taken into 
account when preparing the menu ; but in large families 

[425] 



426 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

perhaps a greater variety will need to be prepared, as all 
may not be able to eat certain kinds of food. If there are 
those in the family who can not 'eat vegetables for dinner, 
there should be fruits, and different preparations of grains, to 
enable them to make a selection.

THANKSGIVING DINNER. 

The Thanksgiving dinner has been a great puzzler to the 
vegetarian housewife. " How can we ever celebrate Thanks- 
giving without a turkey ? " has been a question which it has 
been hard to solve. I propose that we do have a turkey for 
Thanksgiving,-- not the corpse of a bird whose life was sac- 
rificed to satisfy our perverted appetites, but something which, 
although it looks like a real turkey, with neck, wings, legs, 
and even the drum-stick bones protruding, is only one made 
of nuts and grains. Then let us have the pumpkin pie, 
chicken croquettes, and fish all stuffed and baked, the salads, 
and lettuce, --in fact, all that Thanksgiving calls for ; but we 
will use only wholesome material. We will substitute nut 
foods for the different meats, lemon-juice will take the place 
of vinegar, and nuts the place of animal fats. With pains- 
taking, we shall have a better dinner than our sisters who 
have their platters ladened with the remains of a barn-yard 
fowl, and with cakes and pies filled with animal fats and 
spices. Besides this, we shall have a clearer mind, as well as 
a clear conscience ; while those who eat meat are taking 
poisons into the system which benumb the brain, cloud the 
conscience, and render man unfit to meet the vesper hour 
and hold communion with his God. 



432 GUIDE FOR NUT COOKERY. 

THANKSGIVING DINNER MENU. 

SOUP. 

Canned-corn soup, canned-pea soup, or vegetable oyster soup, seasoned 

with raw peanut cream. 

FISH. 
A stuffed baked trout. 

ENTREE. 

Mock chicken croquettes. Serve with it mock salmon salad. 
Stewed salsify (vegetable oyster) with cream. 

THANKSGIVING TURKEY. 

With the turkey send a sauce-boat of gravy, sweet potatoes, curled 
celery or lettuce, and cranberry sauce. 

BREADS. 
Nut crisps, nice buns, and cream rolls. 

PIE. 
Pumpkin pie with cocoanut cream crust. 

FRUITS. 
Fresh fruit, red-cheeked apples, oranges, and any other fruits desired. 

NUTS.

CHRISTMAS DINNER. 

Ornament the table with a dish of ferns and carnations. 
The stems should be long and graceful, and carelessly arranged 
in an old-fashioned china bowl, or a glass dish without feet 
or stem. Or a pretty pot-plant in full bloom makes a very 
pretty centerpiece set upon an oval-shaped mat of velvet or 
plush, the color of which will contrast with the color of the 
blossoms.

NOTICE.-- Before attempting to prepare any of the dishes 
described in this book, the reader is requested to study the 
articles on "Foods" and " Combination of Foods," as well as 
the articles on each class of foods, and thus be certain of the 
highest success.

COMPOSITION OF FOODS. 



THE ordinary food material, such as breads, grains, eggs, 
vegetables, fruit, etc. , consists of, first, the refuse, such 
as the shells of eggs and bran of wheat ; and second, the edi- 
ble portion, as the yolk of the egg and the Hour of wheat. 

In the following table only the edible portion is considered. 
This consists of the non-nutrients and nutrients. Water, 
refuse, and the salt of salted meats are called non-nutrients ; 
while protein, fats, carbohydrates, and ash (mineral matter) 
are the nutrients : - 

PROTEIN.-- i. Albuminoids: albumen (white of egg; casein 
(curd of milk); myosin, the basis of muscle (lean meat); gluten 
of wheat, etc. 2. Gelatinoids : as collagen of tendons, ossein 
of bones which yield gelatin, or glue. 

FATS. --Fats of meat, butter, nuts, corn, olive, etc. 

CARBOHYDRATES.-- Sugar, starch, cellulose (woody fiber). 

ASH, OR MINERAL MATTER. Calcium phosphate, or phos- 
phate of lime; sodium chloride (common salt). 

FUEL VALUE.-- Fuel value represents the number of calo- 
ries of heat which one pound of a given material would yield 
upon combustion, allowance being made for the nitrogenous 
products of metabolism of protein compounds, which are not 
consumed in the body. The fuel value, or potential energy, 
is estimated in calories. The calory is the heat which would 
raise a kilogram of water one degree centigrade (or one pound 
of water about four degrees Fahrenheit). A foot-ton is the 
energy (power) which would lift one ton one foot. One calory 
corresponds to 1.53 foot-tons. A gram of protein or carbo- 
hydrates is assumed to yield 4. i calories, and a gram of fats 
[434] 



COMPOSITION OF FOODS. 435 

9.3. A pound of fats is equivalent in fuel value, on the aver- 
age, to a little over two pounds of protein or carbohydrates. 
The figures for fuel value (potential energy) in the table is 
calculated by multiplying the number of grains of protein and 
of carbohydrates in one pound (i Ib. :z 453.6 grains) by 4. i, 
and the number of grains of fat by 9.3, and taking the 
sum of these three products as the number of calories of 
fuel value in a pound of the material. 

The average composition of these compounds is about as 
follows : - 

Protein contains 53 per cent, carbon, 7 per cent, hydro- 
gen, 24 per cent, oxygen, 16 per cent, nitrogen. 

Fats contain 76.5 per cent, carbon, 12 per cent, hydro- 
gen, 11.5 per cent, oxygen, no nitrogen. 

Carbohydrates contain 44 per cent, carbon, 6 per cent. 
hydrogen, 50 per cent, oxygen, no nitrogen. 

It is to be noted that the fats and carbohydrates contain 
no nitrogen, while the protein does. 

The albuminoids and gelatinoids are frequently classed 
together as proteids. The term "proteids' is also used to 
include all the nitrogenous ingredients; i. c., synonomous 
with protein. 

WAYS IN WHICH MATERIALS ARE USED IN THE BODY. 

Proteins form tissue (muscle, tendon, etc.), and serve as 
fuel. 

Fats form fatty tissue (not muscle, etc.), and serve as fuel. 

Carbohydrates are transformed into fat, and serve as fuel. 

Alcohol does not form tissue, but does serve as fuel. 

Tea and coffee (thein, caffein) do not form tissue, and do 
not serve as fuel. 

Extracts (meat extracts, beef tea) do not form tissue, and 
do not serve as fuel.
