THE IDEAL HOUSEWIFE 

1. "Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 
She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She 
looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her 
children arise up, and call her blessed ; her husband also, and he praiseth her." — 
Proverbs xxxi. 25 — a8.

PREFACE 

In preparing this book for the public our object has been 
to fill a long-felt want, namely a book to which perplexed 
and inexperienced housekeepers can go and be sure that they 
will find therein something to tide them over the emergencies 
that occur in every household. In compiling the recipes for 
cooking we have aimed at simplicity and practicability, 
avoiding, as far as possible, all foreign and ambiguous terms ; 
claiming that, as a rule, American names are good and ex- 
plicit enough for American cooking. 

A medical department forms an important feature of this 
work and is designed to help those who, either from neces- 
sity or from choice, do not wish to consult a physician every 
time that nature requires a little assistance to reassert its 
rights. This part of the work has been prepared, with great 
care, by an eminent physician of long experience and who 
thoroughly understands the human system and its needs. 

Trusting that Treasures Old and New may prove an 
"ever present help" we send it forth on, we hope, its wide- 
spread mission.

GOLDEN RULES FOR THE KITCHEN 



Without cleanliness and punctuality good Cooking is 
impossible. 

Leave nothing dirty; clean and clear as you go. 

A time for everything, and everything in time. 

A good Cook wastes nothing. 

An hour lost in the morning has to be run after all day. 

Haste without hurry saves worry, fuss and flurry. 

Stew boiled is Stew spoiled. 

Strong fire for Roasting ; clear fire for Broiling. 

Wash Vegetables in three waters. 

Boil fish quickly, meat slowly. 

: : GARNISHING : : 



There is a congruity in the serving and garnishing of dishes that is 
often lost sight of. To be very neat, very simple, and good of the kind, 
is generally all that is wanted in a moderate household. There never can 
he any excuse for untidy serving, or food set awry, and grease in the 
wrong place, sauce spilt over the edges of the dish, or dirt. Such things 
look worse on an elaborate dinner than a plain one, just as a soiled collar 
and dirty hands look worst of all with a smart dress and gold bracelets. 

One word more: Never attempt to serve a dinner beyond your powers.

SOUPS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM 



Stock. In preparing stock, which is the basis of most 
soups and. meat sauces, it is not necessary to go through the 
tedious processes prescribed by some. It is simply to extract 
the juices of meats and bones by long and gentle simmering. 
A shank or other meat bones, the carcass of a roast turkey 
or chicken, the trimmings of roasts or steaks are all excellent 
to prepare stock from. Put in a pot and cover with cold 
water, add a handful of salt and boil gently for several hours. 
Do not add any vegetables or spices, as all vegetables lose 
their freshness and flavor by long continued cooking and 
the flavor of the spice might conflict with the other in- 
gredients of the soup for which the stock is intended. 

i 



2 Soups and Hoiv to Make Them 

Skim off all scum that may rise and add water from time to 
time as the stock boils away. When you are ready to make 
the soup, take out all the meat and bones and strain the stock 
through a sieve, a hair one if you have it; the stock is now 
ready for use unless you want a perfectly clear soup. In that 
case, after the stock is strained, put it back in the pot and 
stir in one or two beaten eggs; put back on the fire and as 
it boils up the egg will rise; skim off and strain again and 
your stock will be clear. If you have more than you need 
for immediate use, put aside in a stone or earthen jar, it will 
keep for several days in a cold place. 

Consomme Soup. Chop one and a half pound of lean 
beef, one onion and a carrot together; stir in four eggs, 
shells and all, then add three quarts of cold stock, put in a 
granite or porcelain kettle and let it come to a boil. Skim 
thoroughly. Boil slowly for fifteen or twenty minutes then 
strain through a cloth, and your consomme is ready to serve. 
If due attention has been given to this soup, it will be as 
clear as amber. 

Consomme with Egg. Poach as many eggs soft as 
there are people to serve; place an egg in each plate and 
pour over it a ladle full of the hot consomme and serve at 
once. 

Consomme with Egg KTo. 2. Make a oustard of 
three eggs and half a cup of sweet milk. Bake but do not 
brown. When done, cut in half inch cubes, put in the soup; 
let come to a boil and serve. 

Consomme with Tapioca. Boil your tapioca in salt- 
ed water until clear, (for soups, pearled tapioca is prefer- 
able), put in the soup and boil ten minutes before serving. 

Consomme with Vermicelli. Boil the vermicelli in 
salted water until done, add to the soup and boil five minutes 
before serving. A nice seasoning is made by adding a 
small handful of chopped parsley or celery leaves. 



Soups and How to Make Them 3 

Consomme with Macaroni. Parboil the macaroni 
in salted water, when clone, drain and add to the soup; boil 
ten or fifteen minutes and serve. 

Tomato Soup. Take three quarts of 
stock and let it come to a boil; add to it 
one can of tomatoes, or its equivalent in 
fresh tomatoes, a half cupful of rice and 
boil from one and a half to two hours. 
When the rice is thoroughly done, add a 
lump of butter the size of an egg, season 
with pepper and salt and a tablespoonful of 
su^ar. 




Tomato. 



Cream Tomato (Mock Bisque Soup.) Put two 

quarts of milk in a double boiler; let it come to a boil. 
Put in a stew-pan a can of tomatoes, boil until soft, rub 
through a fine sieve, stir in a teaspoonful of soda to neut- 
ralize the acid. Rub a small tablespoonful of flour in a 
lump of butter the size of an egg and stir in the boiling 
water, add the tomato, season with pepper and salt; boil 
three minutes and serve. 

Potato Soup. Shred a large onion in three pints of 
milk, add two stalks of celery, cut fine, put in a double 
boiler and let it come to a boil. In the meantime pare and 
boil six or seven medium sized potatoes; when done, mash 
thoroughly, beat light and add to the boiling milk, put in 
a lump of butter equal to two tablespoonsfuls; when melted, 
season with pepper and salt, put through a seive and serve 
at once. 

Mutton Broth. Take three pounds of lean mutton and 
cut into small pieces. It is a good plan to get your butcher 
to cut the meat and break the bones for you. Put the meat 
in a granite or porcelain kettle, add two quarts of water and 
an even tablespoonful of salt; cover closely and boil slowly 



4 Soups and Hoiv to Make Them 

for two hours. Put through a strainer and skim off the fat. 
Return to the kettle and stir in a well beaten egg; as it 
comes to a boil skim and continue to do so until clear. It 
is now ready for use if only a broth is required. If you wish 
to make it into a soup you can add rice, barley, chopped 
vegetables or anything that your judgment or taste may 
suggest. 

Barley Soup. Take two quarts of stock, and add to it 
one pound of lean beef, chopped fine, one teacupful 
of pearl barley; boil slowly to avoid scorching, 
cook until the barley is thoroughly done, season 
with pepper and salt. A little choped parsley is a 
nice addition. 




Rice Soup. Take either a shin of 
veal, a medium sized chicken or the re- 
mains of two or three roast chickens, boil 
in three quarts of water until the meat is 
Barley, tender. Separate the meat from the bones 
and chop in pieces the size of a kernel of corn, 
strain the liquor through a sieve, put back in the 
kettle, add a teacupful of rice and a head of 
celery, cut fine, boil until the rice is well done 
add the chopped meat, season with pepper and 
salt, boil five minutes longer, and serve. 




Rice. 



Gumbo Soup. Take a chicken (not too young) and 
one half pound of bacon. Chip the bacon in small slices 
and put in a smooth bottom iron kettle. Cut up the chicken, 
put in with the bacon and fry to a nice brown. Be careful 
not to scorch. When brown add three quarts of water, one 
onion cut fine and any sweet herb you like (if the latter is 
used put it in a small bag), boil slowly for three or four 
hours. Strain off the liquor, skim off the fat, cut the chicken 
and bacon in small pieces, put all back in the kettle together 




Soups and Hoiv to Make Tlicm 5 

with a teacupful of boiled rice and a half teacupful of okra, 
boil half an hour longer and just before serving add a dozen 
oysters, cut in halves, with their juice. 

Celery Cream. Take three or four heads of nice white 
celery, cut in small pieces, cover with water 
and boil until tender, which will take from one- 
half to a whole hour. When tender, drain off 
the water and mash fine. Have ready three 
pints of milk boiling hot and add to it the 
washed celery, and the water in which it was 
boiled. Stir a tablespoonful of flour in a 
lump of butter the size of an egg, add to the 
cream, season with pepper and salt, boil three 
minutes and serve. 

Ox Tail Soup. Cut from a ham bone the small bits 
that cannot be saved in slices, put in a pan with an onion 
and a carrot sliced fine and a lump of butter the size of an 
egg and let brown. Put in the pan four tablespoonsfuls of 
flour and let brown again; add two quarts of good stock and 
boil forty minutes. Cut an ox tail in short lengths, put in 
a frying pan with a lump of butter and a very little water, 
cover close and let it boil until the water is all gone, let the 
ox tail fry to a nice even brown all around, strain the stock 
and pour over the ox tail, add a cupful of boiled barley or 
rice, season with pepper and salt, let come to a boil and 
serve. 

Vegetable Soup. Three quarts of stock, quarter of a 
head of cabbage, half a turnip, one carrot, two onions, three 
potatoes; chop all the vegetables together, add to the stock 
and boil one hour, season to taste and serve. 

Noodle Soup. Two quarts of stock, put in a kettle and 
let come to a boil. To make the noodles, break an egg in a 
bowl, put in a pinch of salt and work in as much flour as it 



6 Soups and How to Make TJiem 

will take, put on the pastry-board and mould smooth, roll 
out as thin as possible, rub a little flour over the surface, 
begin at one end and make into a compact roll; cut this into 
very thin slices, sprinkle a little more flour over them and 
shake them loose. Chop fine a handful of green celery leaves, 
put noodles and leaves in the stock and boil fifteen minutes, 
add pepper and salt to taste. 

Mulligatawny. Brown an onion and a turnip with half 
a pound of lean chipped ham in a saucepan; stir in one 
cupful of flour and pour over all three quarts of hot stock, 
add a three-pound can of tomatoes and boil two hours, put 
through a sieve. Have ready the meat of a chicken cut in 
dices and a cupful of boiled rice. Season with a tablespoon- 
ful of curry powder, salt and pepper. 

Pea Soup. Take a can of peas or a quart of fresh peas, 
boil until tender and rub-through a 
sieve, add a quart of milk, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and 
pepper to taste and boil five min- 
utes. Just before serving roll two 
soda crackers into the soup. Serve 
at once. 



Split Pea Soup. Wash two 
pounds of split peas, put in sauce- 
pan with two quarts of water and boil 
for one hour. Drain off the water 
sweeTpea. and add four quarts of good strong 

stock, a ham bone, and an onion and a carrot chopped to- 
gether. Let all boil together slowly for three or four hours, 
put through a sieve, season to taste and serve with sippets 
of bread.

in quarter inch lengths, boil until tender but not soft enough 




Soups and How to Make TJiem 7 

to mash, and drain off the water. Chop an onion very fine, 
put in a stew-pan with a lump of butter, the size of an egg

milk, let it boil up once, season with pepper and salt and 
serve. 

Okra Soup. Cut the okra in half inch pieces, boil tender

carefully remove the fat. Put the stock into a stewpan with 
the remainder of the vegetables, and the meat finely 
shredded. Whisk over the fire until the soup is just on the 
boil. Draw it on one side, and allow it to simmer gently 
for 10 minutes; when clarified, strain through a clean cloth, 
add the stock, some force-meat balls, and pieces of the head 
served in the soup. 

Julienne Soup. Procure % pint of carrots, % pint of 
turnips, % pint of onions, 2 leeks, J /2 head 
of celery, ]/ 2 lettuce, a little sorrel, if 
liked, 1 oz. of butter, 2 quarts of stock. 
Cut the vegetables into strips of 1% inches 
long, and be particular they are all the 
same size, or some will be hard whilst the 
others will be done to a pulp. Cut the let- 
tuce and sorrel into larger pieces; fry the 
strips of Vegetables, carrots in the butter, and pour the stock, 
boiling, to them. When this is done, add all the other 
vegetables and herbs, and stew gently for at least an hour. 
Skim off all the fat, pour the soup over thin slices of bread, 
cut round, about the size of a shilling, and serve. The soup 
has a better appearance if each vegetable is boiled sepa-

rately in water and then added to the clear stock, at the 
moment of serving. 

Carrot and Lentil Soup. Procure 4 carrots, 2 sliced 
onions, 1 cut lettuce and chervil;. 2 oz. butter, 
2 pints of lentils, the crumbs of 2 French rolls, 
half a teacupful of rice, 4 quarts of stock. 
Put the vegetables with the butter in the stew- 
pan, and let them simmer 5 minutes; then add 
the lentils, which should have been soaked all 
night, and 1 pint of the stock, and stew gently 
for half an hour. Now fill it up with the 
The Lenti; remainder of the stock, let it boil another 
hour, and put in the crumbs of the rolls. When well soaked, 
rub all through a tammy. Have ready the rice boiled; pour 
the soup over this and serve. 

Cucumber Soup. Procure 1 large cucumber, a piece 
of butter the size of a walnut, a little sorrel, 
cut in large pieces, salt and pepper to taste, 
the yolks of two eggs, 1 gill of cream, 1 
quart of. stock. Pare the cucumber, quarter 
it, and take out the seeds; cut it in thin 
slices, put these on a plate with a little salt, 
to draw the water from them; drain, and 
put them in your stewpan with the butter. 
1 1, ; , i When they are warmed through, without 
being browned, pour the stock on them. Add the sorrel, 
chervil and seasoning, and boil for forty minutes. Mix the 
well-beaten yolks of the eggs with the cream, which add at 
the moment of serving. 

Hodge-Podge. Procure 1 lb. of shin of beef, 2 quarts 
of water, ^ pint of table-beer, 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 turnip r 
1 head of celery, pepper and salt to taste, thickening of 
butter and flour. Put the meat, beer and water in a stew^ 





Soups and How to Make Them 1 1 

pan; simmer for a few minutes, and skim carefully. Add 
the vegetables and seasoning; stew gently till the meat is 
tender. Thicken with butter and flour, and serve with 
turnips and carrots or spinach and celery. 

Shrimp Soup. You need two quarts of fish stock, two 
pints of shrimp, the crumbs of a French roll, 
anchovy sauce or mushroom ketchup to taste, one 
blade of mace, % pint of vinegar, a little lemon 
juice. Pick out the tails of the shrimps, put the 
bodies in a stewpan, with i blade of mace, % 
pint of vinegar, and the same quantity of water; 
stew them for quarter of an hour, and strain off 
the liquor. Put the fish stock into a stewpan, 
add the strained liquor, pound the shrimps with 
The shrimp. crum b of a roll, moistened with a little of the 
soup; rub them through a tammy, and mix them by degrees 
with the soup; add ketchup or anchovy sauce to taste, with 
a little lemon juice. When it is well cooked, put in a few 
pickled shrimps; let them get thoroughly hot, and serve. 
If not thick enough put in a little butter and flour. 

Note. — This can be thickened with tomatoes and vermicelli served in 
it, which makes it a very tasteful cup. The soup can be made of shrimps 
and garnished with prawns, where economy is an object. 

Onion Soup. Eight middling-sized onions,3 oz. of butter, 
a tablespoonful of rice flour, salt and pepper to taste, i tea- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, thickening of butter and flour, 
2 quarts of water. Cut the onions small, put them in the 
stewpan with the butter, and fry them well; mix the rice 
flour smoothly with the water, add the onions, seasoning and 
sugar, and simmer till tender. Thicken with butter and 
flour and serve. It is better to rub the soup through a sieve. 
Spanish onions make the best soup. 

Spinach Soup. Take as much spinach as, when boiled, 
will half fill a vegetable dish, 2 quarts of very clear stock. 



12 Soups and How to Make Them 

Make the cooked spinach into balls the size of an egg, and 
slip them into the soup-tureen. This is a very elegant soup, 
the green of the spinach forming a pretty contrast to the 
brown gravy. 

White Soup. Procure % lb. of sweet almonds, % lb. of 
cold veal or poultry, a thick slice of stale bread, a piece of 
fresh lemon peel, i blade of mace, pounded ; ^ pint of cream, 
the yolks of 2 eggs, 2 quarts of white stock. Reduce the 
almonds in a mortar to a paste, with a spoonful of water, 
and add to them the meat, which should be previously 
pounded with the bread. Beat all together and add the 
lemon peel, very finely chopped, and the mace. Pour the 
boiling stock on the whole, and simmer for an hour. Rub 
the eggs in the cream, put in the soup, bring it to a boil and 
serve immediately. 

Semolina Soup. You need 5 oz. of semolina, 2 quarts 
of boiling stock. Drop the semolina into the boiling stock, 
and keep stirring, to prevent its burning or going into 
lumps. Simmer gently for half an hour and serve. 

Vegetable Stock. Two quarts of water, 2 oz. of haricot 
beans, 2 oz. of split peas, 1 onion, 1 carrot, }4 stick of 
celery, parsley and herbs, pepper, salt, 5 cloves and a blade 
of mace. Boil in 2 quarts of water for 3 or 4 hours all the 
above vegetables, spice and herbs. Strain it off. It will 
keep for some time if it is let to stand and poured off from 
the sediment. 

Note. — This may serve as the basis of a good many soups and sauces, 
jnst as stock made of meat and bones serves many purposes. All cooks 
may be assured that if gravy has to be made, and no meat 'is at hand to 
make it of, water in which any vegetables have been boiled (except potatoes) 
will be better than water from the tap or kettle. 

White Stock. Four lbs. of knuckle of veal, any poultry 
trimmings or a rabbit, 4 slices of lean ham, 3 carrots, 2 
onions, 1 head of celery, 12 white peppercorns, 2 oz. of salt, 



Soups and Hoiv to Make Them 13 

1 blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, 1 oz. butter, 4 quarts of 
water. Cut up the veal, and put it, with the bones and 
trimmings of poultry and the ham, into the stewpan, which 
has been rubbed with the butter. Moisten with y 2 a pint of 
water, and simmer till the gravy begins to flow. Then add 
the 4 quarts of water and the remainder of the ingredients; 
simmer for 5 hours. After skimming and straining it care- 
fully through a fine hair sieve, it will be ready for use. 

Note. — When stronger stock is desired, double the quantity of veal, 
or put in an old fowl. The liquor in which a young turkey or a fowl has 
been boiled is an excellent addition to all white stock of soups, and the bird 
is better boiled in the stock-pot than in water. Bones that have been boiled 
once for brown stock can be boiled again with fresh vegetables for white. 

Fish Stock. Take two pounds of any kind of fish that 
is cheap, such as shad, flounders or small eels, or the trim- 
ming and heads of uncooked fish, a head of celery, a root of 
parsley, a blade or two of mace, a bay leaf, a few cloves and 
white pepper, and salt to taste; three quarts of water. Put 
the whole into a pan, and let it simmer gently for a couple 
of hours; then strain off the liquor.

FISH AND HOW TO COOK IT 

General Instructions. 

Fish cannot be too fresh. The sooner it is eaten after com- 
ing out of the water the better. In selecting fish for the table 
see that the flesh is firm, the eyes bright, the gills red, and 
the fins stiff. Nothing deteriorates more quickly than fish; 
as soon as it has lost its first freshness it has also lost its 
delicate flavor, and moreover becomes decidedly unwhole- 
some. The principal ways of cooking fish are Frying, Boil- 
ing, Broiling, Baking and Stewing, and with but few except- 
ions all varieties can be rendered palatable by any of the 
above processes. In preparing fish for cooking, cleanse and 
wash thoroughly in cold water, be careful not to bruise or 
break, and do not leave it in the water longer than is 
absolutely necessary, as it destroys the flavor. An exception 
can be made in case of some varieties of fresh water fish 
which have a muddy flavor. These can be dressed,, washed, 
and left in salt and water for two or three hours. Be sure 
and have the water cold. In boiling fish a fish kettle with 
a perforated bottom is a great convenience, but is not 
absolutely indispensable. Fish can be boiled very nicely 
in a deep dripping pan by wrapping it up in thin cloth and 
if the pan is not deep enough to cover the fish it can be 
turned over once or twice. The time required to boil a 
medium sized fish is from twenty to thirty minutes if the 
water is kept bubbling all the time. But the surest test is to 
insert the blade of a knife between the fish and the bone; if 

14 



Fish and How to Cook It

it flakes readily and separates easily it is ready to take 
from the fire. Fish that is to be broiled whole should be 
split down the back. 

With regard to sauces for fish it is difficult to give advice. 
There are many who would consider fish served without 
sauce as utterly flat, stale and unprofitable. And again there 
are others, and they are by no means in the minority, who 
assume that the delicate flavors are disguised if not utterly 
destroyed by the addition of highly flavored sauces. As a 
rule people who live near the seashore, and who can obtain 
fish in the highest state of excellence, seldom use anything 
besides pepper and salt as seasoning. It is therefore a nice 
plan for the cook to study the tastes of those to whom she 
caters. 

Boiled Cod. Take a small cod or as many pounds as

with salt, roll tightly 
in a thin cloth, pin

water, unroll carefully, leaving the cloth under the fish; take 
the skin off the upper side, turn the fish over by slightly 
raising the cloth and skin the other side, transfer to a platter, 
pour over it hot melted butter, garnish with parsley and 
serve. 

These directions will answer for all kinds of boiled fresh 
fish except salmon, which is rich enough without the melted 
butter. An egg dressing or Old Zealand sauce is more suit- 
able for fish that are rich in oils. 




1 6 Fish and How to Cook It 

Salt Cod with Eggs. Pick a pint bowlful of the cod, 
put in a stew pan, cover with water, set on the back of the 
stove and as the water becomes salt, change; two or three 
times will be sufficient. When fresh enough drain off the 
water and add a lump of butter size of an egg and let it melt, 
then stir in a tablespoonful of flour and let cook, but do not 
brown; add three cups of milk and let come to a boil then 
break in carefully as many fresh eggs as there are persons to 
serve. Take the eggs out when the whites are done, place 
on a shallow dish, pour the fish over the eggs and serve. 

Salt Cod with. Eggs No. 2. Prepare the fish as above 
and instead of dropping in the eggs whole, put in two and 
stir in with a fork; cook three minutes and serve. 

Fish Balls. Take one part fish and two parts raw potato, 
about three pints in all. Pare and cut the potatoes in halves, 
pick the fish, freeing it from bones and put in a kettle with 
the potatoes, the fish on top ; cover with water and boil thirty 
minutes, drain and mash potatoes and fish together, season 
with salt and pepper and a lump of butter size of an egg, then 
add two well beaten eggs and mix all thoroughly together. 
Have a kettle half full of hot fat, shape the mixture with 
a spoon and drop into the hot fat and fry to a light brown; 
serve hot. 

Stewed Fish. Any kind of fish are good for stewing 
but catfish and bullhead are particularly suited to this style 
of cooking. Skin and cleanse the fish, and if small leave 
whole but if large cut into pieces suitable for serving. Shred 
an onion into a flat bottomed pan or kettle, add a lump of 
butter size of an egg, let brown slightly, then lay the fish 
side by side in the pan, season with salt and pepper, cover 
with water, put a close cover over the whole and stew thirty 
minutes. Take the fish out of the kettle with a tin shovel, 
put on a hot platter, thicken the liquor with a spoonful of 
flour, pour over the fish and serve. 




Fish and Hoiv to Cook It iy 

Boiled Salt Cod. Soak the fish over night; when fresh 
enough place in a kettle and simmer from twenty to thirty 
minutes, place the pieces carefully on a platter, pour over it 
a cream sauce and serve. 

Boiled Salt White Fish. Salt white fish can be treated 
the same as salt cod, except that it must be pinned in a 
cloth to prevent its breaking while boiling. 

Boiled Flounders. Cleanse, wrap in a cloth and boil 
for twenty-five minutes and serve 
with melted butter or Old Zealand 
sauce. 

Broiled Fish. All small fish, 
that is those weighing from one- 
^rjfe g ^ half to three pounds, are suitable 
Flounders. for broiling. Blue fish, cod, mack- 

erel, trout, whitefish, perch, bass, pike, and pickerel are all 

excellent when broiled. 
Cleanse the fish, split- 
ting down the back, 
wash and wipe dry, cut- 
ting off the fins with a 
pair of shears. Have a 
ThePike wire broiler, rub the 

wires with a piece of bacon or a little fat, to prevent stick- 
ing, put the fish in the broiler, and turn the inside to the 
fire first. As the cooking progresses sprinkle with a little 
salt and if the fish is of a^dry variety put on a little melted 
butter from time to time. If the fish is very thick and there 
is danger of scorching before it is cooked through, place the 
broiler over a dripping pan and put in the oven; the even 
heat of the oven will soon finish cooking the fish, and will 
not destroy that peculiar flavor produced by broiling. 
Broiled fish should be served the instant it is done. Most 
people prefer broiled fish without sauce, but tomato, capers,

Fish and Hotv to Cook It 




anchovy, Old Zealand or Tartare sauce are considered de- 
sirable accessories by some. 

Fried Fish. Frying is one of the simplest methods of 
cooking fish, and therefore easily 
acquired. All small fish should be 
fried whole, while larger fish can be 
split down the back and then cut in 
suitable pieces. Pork fat, lard or' 
TheShaci. drippings are all used, but the first 

is preferable. After the fish is cleaned and washed, sprinkle 
with salt and let it stand for sometime, but be sure and keep 
it in a cold place. Fill the spider or kettle half full of fat, 
roll the fish in flour and put in the hot fat and fry to a nice 
brown. Serve with or without sauce, as desired, but tomato 
sauce forms a particularly fine addition to fried fish. 

All fish steaks, such as cod, halibut, haddock and salmon, 
can be cooked and served in the above manner but you can 
vary the form of cooking by sometimes dipping the steaks 
in beaten egg and then in cracker crumbs and frying to a 
brown, and again there are some kinds of fish that are much 
better by being fried in butter. Brook trout, smelts and 
salmon steak are among the number. 

Fried Smelts. Cut the fish open and cleanse but leave 

the head on. Lay on a plate and 
sprinkle with salt. Have enough 
hot fat in a frying pan to float 
the fish, dip the smelts in flour 
and fry from two to three min-

utes. 

Fried Smelts No. 2. Make a thin batter of one beaten 
egg, half a cup of milk and an even tablespoonful of flour, 
add a pinch of salt. Cleanse the fish removing the heads, 
and sprinkle with salt as above. Put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a frying pan and when hot pour in half the batter 




The Smelt. 




Fish and How to Cook It 19 

and into this lay the smelts side by side as close as they can 
be laid and covering the whole bottom of the pan then over 
the whole pour the rest of the batter and fry to a nice brown, 
turn over as you would a pancake. When both sides are a 
nice brown cut in squares and serve at once. 

Fried Herring. Fried herring is much nicer when 
boned before frying. Scale and wash 
the fish, cutting off the head. Hold 
the fish in the left hand and insert 
the thumb of the right hand at the 
shoulder next the backbone and 
The Herring. work the thumb slowly the whole 

length of the spine, then turn over and do the other side 
in like manner. If this process is gone through carefully 
the whole skeleton can be taken out without losing a bone 
and also without breaking the fish. When loose cut the bone 
close to the tail and trim off the fins with a pair of shears, 
sprinkle the fish with salt, roll in flour, fry in hot fat until 
brown and serve. 

To Cook Eels. Skin and cleanse the eels and cut in two 

inch lengths. 
Slice half a 
pound of fat

to a crisp; take out the pork and put the eel in the pan; if 
small set the lengths up on end, but if large you can put them 
in the pan lengthwise; sprinkle with salt and a very little 
pepper, add half a cup of water, cover lightly so that part of 
the steam can escape, put on the fire and cook until the water 
has all boiled away and one side of the eel is fried to a nice 
brown, then turn over carefully and fry the other side. 

Baked Fish. Only large fish are suitable for baking 
and all varieties are treated in much the same manner. Scale 
and clean the fish, leaving on the head and rub with salt. 





20 Fish and How to Cook It 

Make a dressing of a bowl of bread or cracker crumbs a 
quarter of a pound of salt pork chopped fine, a small onion or 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley; salt and pepper to taste; 
mix thoroughly together and put in the body of the fish. 
Cut gashes along the back of the fish about an inch apart, 
into each gash place a small strip of fat pork securing them 
in place with small skewers; tooth picks will answer nicely, 
put the fish in the pan and dredge with salt, pepper and flour, 
put a cupful of water in the bottom of the pan and bake for 
about an hour, basting frequently. If the water in the pan 
evaporates, add more. 

Fish Chowder. Haddock, cod and striped bass are best 
SI||r for chowder but any kind of fresh 
^ fish can be used. 
"^^^^^ Cut a pound of salt pork in slices 
^a^*~2p§ put in an iron kettle and fry till

thick and two inches square ; sprinkle the fish with salt, pepper 
and a dash of red pepper, put in a layer of broken crackers, 
some of the fried pork chopped fine and a finely sliced'onion, 
then another layer of fish, another of cracker, seasoning and 
so on. Cover with water, and stew until done. Remove the 
fish, thicken the liquor with rolled cracker or flour, pour over 
the fish and serve. Sauce or wine can be added if desired. 

Escalloped Fish. Take any cold fresh fish, as trout or 
whitefish; that left from a previous meal will do nicely; 
pick into flakes and be careful to free from all bones, put in 
the bottom of an earthen pudding dish a layer of cracker 
crumbs then a layer of fish, put in a little pepper, salt if 
necessary, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, then another 
layer of crumbs, then of fish, seasoning and so on until the 
dish is nearly full. Have a layer of cracker on top and over 
the whole pour enough milk to nearly cover, put a small 



Fish and How to Cook It 21 

plate on top and bake for thirty or forty minutes in a brisk 
oven. Ten minutes before serving, take off the plate to let 
it brown. If possible serve out of the dish in which it was 
prepared by placing the dish inside another and putting a 
garnish of parsley around the edge. 

Eel with Tartare Sauce. Take 2 lbs. of eels, 1 carrot, 
1 onion, a little flour, 1 glass of sherry; salt, pepper and 
nutmeg to taste; bread crumbs, 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar. Rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan ; cut 
up the carrot and onion, and stir them over the fire for five 
minutes; dredge in a little flour, add the wine and season- 
ing, and boil for half an hour. Skin and wash the eels, cut 
them into pieces, put them to the other ingredients, and sim- 
mer till tender. When they are done take them out, let them 
get cold, cover them with egg and bread crumbs, and fry 
them a nice brown. Put them on a dish, pour sauce piquante 
over, and serve them hot.- 

Fillets of Mackerel. Procure 2 large mackerel, 1 oz. 

butter, 1 small bunch 01 
^chopped herbs, 3 table- 
spoonfuls of good fish 
stock, 3 tablespoonfuls

salt, cayenne and lemon juice to taste. Clean the fish, 
and fillet it; scald the herbs, chop them fine, and put 
them with the butter and stock into a stewpan. Lay in the 
mackerel, and simmer very gently for 10 minutes; take them 
out, and put them on a hot dish. Dredge in a little flour, 
add the other ingredients, give one boil, and pour it over the 
mackerel. 

Salmon with Caper Sauce. Take 2 slices of salmon, 
% lb. butter, l / 2 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 shalot, 
salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste. Lay the salmon 
in a baking dish, place pieces of butter over it, and add the

other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning into the 
fish; baste it frequently ; when done take it out and drain 
for a minute or two; lay it in a dish,^pour caper sauce over 
it, and serve. Salmon dressed in a similar way, and 
with tomato sauce, is very delicious. 

Stewed Trout. You need 2 good-sized trout, x /z onion, 
cut in thin slices; a little parsley, 2 cloves, 
1 blade of mace, 2 bay leaves, a little thyme, 
salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of stock, 1 
glass of claret or port wine, 1 oz. each of 
butter and flour. Wash the fish very clean, 
and wipe it quite dry. Lay it in a stew- 
pan, with all the ingredients but the butter 
and flour, and simmer gently for half an 
hour, or rather more, should the fish be not

SHELL FISH AND HOW TO PREPARE IT 



Oysters on the Half Shell. Oysters to be eaten on the 
half shell should not be opened un- 
til just before serving. If possible 
get a market man to open your 
oysters for you or at least show you 
how it is done. About six are al- 
lowed for each peison. Put the 
oysters on the half shell on a dinner 
plate, put a slice of lemon in the center and serve. 

Oysters on the Half Shell, No. 2. Place half a dozen 
oysters on the half shell on a dinner plate, and an empty 
shell in the middle to contain the vinegar, etc. If it is not

Shell Fish and Hozv to Prepare It 23 

convenient to obtain shell oysters, very nice ones can be 
obtained in bulk ; these are served on small plates with a 
slice of lemon or on regular oyster plates, which have 
cavities for half a dozen oysters, also extra ones for the 
seasoning. Put both oysters and plates on the ice for an 
hour or two before serving. 

Oysters on a Block of Ice. Saw a block of ice to fit 
a platter, square if you have one. A block twelve or four- 
teen inches square, by eight or nine deep, is a nice size. Into 
the middle of the block make a cavity by placing on it a 
tin basin of hot water; as the ice melts pour off the water 
and keep renewing the water in the tin until the cavity will 
hold as many oysters as you wish to serve. You can judge 
the capacity of the cavity by that of the basin. Drain the 
oysters in a colander, then put them in the ice; garnish or 
trim the dish with parsley, celery, cress or flowers. This is 
not only a nice way to serve oysters, but is also an elegant 
ornament for a table. 

Fried Oysters. Put the oysters in a colander, pour 
water over them, then take out and wipe dry. Have some 
crackers rolled fine, season with pepper and salt and put on 
a platter. Beat an egg and dip the oysters in it, then roll 
in the cracker crumb and lay them on a plate covered with 
the cracker dust. Fry crisp and brown in hot lard or butter, 
or half and half of each. Serve at once. 

Broiled Oysters. Dry large selected oysters, place on 
a fine wire broiler, turning often. Have some toast pre- 
pared, butter the oysters, season with salt and pepper, place 
on the toast, put in the oven for a moment to heat, and 
serve. 

Oysters Roasted in the Shell. Wash the shells and 
wipe them dry, put in a baking pan and bake for twenty or 
twenty-five minutes in a brisk oven. Serve on hot plates as 
soon as taken from the oven. 



24 Shell Fish and How to Prepare It 

Escalloped Oysters. Put a quart of oysters in a col- 
ander, wash thoroughly by pouring cold water over them. 
Reduce eight or ten crackers to dust by rolling them. Butter 
an earthen pudding dish, put a layer of cracker dust in the 
bottom of the dish, then a layer of oysters, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and pour then two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter and three of milk, then another of cracker and so on 
until the dish is nearly full. Have a layer of the cracker 
dust on top with small lumps of butter through it. Bake 
about one half hour. 

Oyster Stew. Let three pints of water come to a boil, put 
in one quart of oysters, half a cup of butter and season with 
salt and pepper, let it boil up once more and serve at once. 

Milk Stew. One quart of milk and one pint of water, 
let them boil together, then add one quart of oysters, a lump 
of butter the size of an egg, season with salt and pepper and 
let come to a boil once more, then add a double handful of 
crushed crackers and serve. 

Pickled Oysters. Put in a porcelain kettle a hundred 
large oysters with the liquor and simmer until the edges curl ; 
take out the oysters and add to the liquor a scant pint of 
vinegar, ten or a dozen blades of mace, a lablespoonful each 
of peppercorn and cloves; let it come to aboil and pour 
over the oysters. 

Oyster Pie. Line a pudding dish with a rich biscuit 
crust and dredge well with flour, put in a quart of washed 
oysters, season with salt and pepper, add two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and half a cup of milk, dredge with flour, put on 
the top crust cutting a small opening for the steam to escape. 
Bake about half an hour. 

Oyster Patties. Boil a quart of oysters with just 
enough liquor to cover them; as soon as they come to a boil, 
season with salt and pepper and three tablespoonfuls of butter. 



Shell Fish and How t-o Prepare It

Line some pattypans with puff paste, fill with the oysters and 
cover then well with rolled cracker. Bake fifteen or twenty 
minutes. 

Frieassed Oysters. Put in a stewpan a pint of drained 
oysters, add a tablespoonful of hot water, salt and pepper, 
and a dash of cayenne pepper. Boil for about three minutes, 
shaking the pan to keep from sticking. Strain out the oysters 
and add to the liquor a gill of cream. Cook, but do not 
brown, a tablespoonful each of butter and flour together. 
Add slowly the oyster liquor and cream; when boiling hot 
stir in one well beaten egg, add the oysters, pour the whole 
over buttered toast, and serve. 

Boiled Lobster. Put in a kettle of water and add a 

good sized hand- 
ful of salt; when 
the water boils 
fast plunge in the 
lobsters alive. 
Boil for about

Lobster Cutlets. Take two cans of lobster or the meat 
of a large fresh one and cut into pieces half an inch square. 




26 Shell Fish and How to Prepare It 

Put in a stewpan a lump of butter the size of an egg and 
cook into it a small tablespoonful of flour and two rolled 
crackers, then add a cupful of milk and a beaten egg; when 
it boils, add the lobster, stir and take off the fire. Butter a 
square tin pan and pour the mixture into it. It should be 
about an inch thick. When cool cut in squares, dip in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs, put in a wire basket, plunge in 
hot fat and fry to a nice brown. Arrange on a hot platter, 
garnish with parsley, and serve. 

Lobster Curry. Put in a frying pan a lump of butter 
size of an egg and shred into it a small onion, and fry brown; 
when brown add a tablespoonful of flour, two small teaspoon- 
fuls of curry powder, a very little cayenne and a pinch of 
salt; then add two cupfuls of milk or water; when it boils up 
add the meat of one large lobster or two cans of lobster, cut 
into small bits, simmer a few minutes; pour on a hot platter, 
border with rice croquettes and serve. 

Soft Shell Crabs. After lifting off the shell, remove 
the spongy substance found on the back, 
pull off the apron, season with salt and 
pepper, and fry in hot fat for about ten 
minutes. 

Clam Chowder. One-half pound

minced fine, fry them together, strain off the grease and put 
in one and one-half gallons of stock; let it boil, add six large 
potatoes, cut in slices or dice, add three dozen clams cut up; 
when potatoes are quite soft add one quart of boiling milk, 
one-half pound good butter, season with salt and pepper; if 
not thick enough dissolve two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, 
and thicken the soup with it. 

Mussels. Take one quart of mussels, one onion, parsley, one 
oz. of butter, one oz. of flour, one or two eggs, vinegar. Clean 
the shell and put the mussels in a pan with a little water and

vinegar, mix parsley, pepper and salt. Set them over a 
small fire; as soon as the shells open they are done. Melt 
the butter in another pan, add the flour and the strained 
liquor, then the yolks of eggs. Pour over the mussels, and 
serve at once. Chopped parsley may be added. 
Lobster Patties. Take minced lobster, four table- 
spoonfuls of French white sauce, six 
drops of anchovy sauce, lemon juice, 
cayenne to taste. Line the patty pans 
Patties. with puff paste, and fill each with flour; 

cover with paste, brush over with egg, and bake of a light 
color. Take as much lobster as is required, mince the meat 
very fine, and add the above ingredients; stir it over the fire 
for five minutes; remove the lids of the patty pans, take out 
the flour, fill with the mixture, and replace the covers. 
Buttered Prawns. Needed one pint of picked prawns, 
three-quarters of a pint of stock; 
thickening of butter and flour; salt, 
'cayenne and nutmeg to taste. Pick 
the prawns and put them into stewpan 
with the stock. Add a thickening of 
The Prawn! ' butter and flour, season, and simmer 

gently for three minutes. Serve on a dish garnished with fried 
bread or toasted sippets. Cream sauce may be substituted 
for the gravy 

To Choose Lobsters. These are chosen more by weight 
than size; the heaviest are best; a good, small-sized one 
will not infrequently be found to weigh as heavily as one 
much larger. If fresh, a lobster will be lively and the 
claws have a strong motion when the eyes are pressed with 
the fingers. 

The male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer, and the 
shell a brighter red; it may be readily distinguished from 
the female; the tail is narrower, and the two uppermost fins 
within the tail are stiff and hard. Those of the hen lobster 
are not so, and the tail is broader.

MEAT AND HOW TO COOK IT 




BEEF 



How to Select Beef. In selecting beef see that the 
grain is smooth and open ; if the fiber parts or breaks readily 
on being pressed by the finger, it will be found to be tender. 
The color should be a deep rose, and the fat a rich cream 
color; if the fat is white it is an indication that the beef is 
young and lacking in flavor, and if of a deep yellow, the 
meat will be apt to be tough and of inferior quality. The 
choicest cuts for roasting are the sixth, seventh and eighth 
ribs, the sirloin and porterhouse cuts. In selecting steak, 
avoid the first three or four cuts, as they are apt to be broken 
and stringy. Sirloin and short cut porterhouse steaks are 
best, although the pinbone steak is considered best by some. 
Round steak is almost invariably tough. Beef tenderloin, 
cut across the grain, makes most delicious steak. 

Roast Beef. After selecting the roast at the market if 

the rib is too long for the roast 
to present a symmetrical appear- 
ance, have the butcher saw off 
about four inches of the rib and 
remove the chine, leaving the 
ribs in the roast. All meats are 

better flavored and more nutritious by being cooked without

Sirloin of Beef. 



30 Meat a?td Hozv to Cook It 

removing at least some of the bones. To prepare for roast- 
ing, wash the meat and wipe dry with a towel, dredge with 
salt and pepper, put in the pan on a rack, if you have one, 
pour a pint of water in the pan, and put in the oven. The 
oven should be very hot for the first ten or fifteen minutes, 
to harden the albumen, after that a more moderate heat will 
answer. The time required to roast beef is from ten to 
twenty minutes to the pound, according as it is to be rare, 
medium, or well done. Baste every ten or fifteen minutes. 
Some cooks dredge the roast with flour to prevent the juices 
from escaping. A few minutes before serving, remove the 
meat from the pan, place in the warming closet and into the 
gravy stir a tablespoonful of flour mixed with half a cup of 
water; if too thick, add more water. If there is too much 
fat it should be skimmed off before thickening the gravy. 
Serve the roast on a hot platter and the gravy in a hot boat. 

Braised Beef. Take four or five pounds of beef, that 
with a little fat on it is best, and have it cut in squares 
about three inches long by two broad, and one and a half or 
two inches thick, dredge with salt and pepper and a little 
flour. Slice half a pound of fat pork into an iron dripper or 
braising pan, fry until crisp, draw to one side and slice in 
two onions and half of a small carrot, fry these until brown 
and then put in the beef, laying the pieces side by side, add 
two tablespoonfuls of water and cover, cook slowly until the 
meat is brown on all sides; it will take from two to three 
hours; when done, take out the meat, add a pint of water, 
stir a tablespoonful of flour mixed smooth with a little water, 
pour around the meat and serve. 

Beef Stew. Take two or three pounds of clean beef or 
the remnants of a roast, cut into small pieces, put in a stew- 
pan, cover with water and boil until tender, add a small 
lump of butter and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour 
mixed smooth with a little cold water. Some prefer a few 



Meat and How to Cook It 



31 




Pimento. (Allspice.) 



vegetables boiled with the meat, or a few dumplings make a 
nice addition. 

Beef a La Mode. You need about 3 lbs. of clod or 
flank of beef, 2 oz. of clarified dripping, 
1 large onion, flour, 2 quarts of water, 12 
berries of allspice, 2 bay-leaves, yz tea- 
spoonful of whole black pepper, salt to 
taste. Cut the beef into small pieces, 
and roll them in flour; put the dripping 
into a stew-pan with the onion, which 
should be sliced thin. Let it get quite 
hot; lay in the pieces of beef, and stir 
them well about. When nicely browned all over, add by degrees 
boiling water in the above proportion, and, as the water is 
added, keep the whole well stirred. Put in the spice, bay- 
leaves, and seasoning, cover the stew-pan closely, and set it 
by the side of the fire to stew very gently, till the meat be- 
comes quite tender, which will be in about three hours, 
when it will be ready to serve. Remove the bay-leaves 
before it is sent to table. 

Scotch Roll. Take four or five pounds of the flank of a 
beef, wash and dry with a towel, spread on the board and 
dredge with salt and pepper. Make a dressing of a quart of 
bread crumbs, moistened with milk or water, and seasoned 
with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a small onion 
chopped fine, a tablespoonful of powdered sage, and pepper 
and salt to taste, mix all well together and spread evenly 
over the meat. Roll up and tie with twine, put in a pan 
with a pint of water and bake for two or three hours, rolling 
over often so as to cook even on all sides. 

Fried Beefsteak. In very hot frying pan put a little 
fat then your steak, season with salt and pepper; fry to a 
nice brown; cover not while cooking. When done, spread 
some o"ood butter over it and serve. 



32 Meat and Hoiv to Cook It 

Broiled Beefsteak. Have your steak from three- 
quarters to an inch in thickness. Never pound steak. 
Butter your steak and broil quickly over a clear fire, season 
with salt and pepper, put a piece of good butter on a hot 
plate and the steak on top. Serve at once. 

Hamburger Steak. Chop a pound of lean beef very 
fine, a small piece of suet makes a good addition; shred an 
onion, mix with the beef, season with salt and pepper, and 

a little savory; fry in butter and serve. 

* 
Corned Beef. It takes a cook to make nice corned 

beef. This meat should be boiled slow and when done take 

pot and all off the fire, leaving the corned beef in its stock 

until wanted to send to the table. Any piece left over to be 

used cold, should be left in the stock until cold and then 

taken out, put on a plate and placed in the refrigerator. 

Filet of Beef Larded. Order the filet from your 
butcher larded. About five pounds will be enough for a 
dinner of eight persons. Cut an onion, a carrot and one- 
fourth of a turnip in slices, and put in the pan intended to 
roast the fiiet; salt the meat, pour a little fat over it and 
put in the oven to roast. Should the top or larding ends 
get too brown, butter a piece of paper on both sides and 
place over the meat. Thirty minutes will be required to 
cook a five pound filet rare. Serve with mushroom sauce. 

Beefsteak Toast. Chop pieces of cold steak very fine, 
put in a stew pan with a small lump of butter and enough 
water to more than cover. Boil twenty minutes, then stir in 
a well beaten egg. Season with salt and pepper, pour over 
toasted bread and serve hot. 

Beef Kidney. Take one kidney, one desertspoonful of 
minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, salt and 
pepper to taste, % pint of gravy, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry. 
Take off a little of the kidney fat, mince it very fine, and 



Meat and How to Cook It 33 

put it in a frying pan; slice the kidney, sprinkle over it 
parsley and shalots in the above proportion, add a seasoning 
of pepper and salt, and fry it of a nice brown. When it is 
done enough, dredge over a little flour, and pour in the 
gravy and sherry. Let it just simmer, but not boil any 
more, or the kidney would harden; serve very hot, and gar- 
nish with croutons. Where the flavor of the shalot is dis- 
liked, it may be omitted, and a small quantity of savory 
herbs substituted for it. 

Beef Kidney, No. 2. (A more simple method.) Cut 
the kidney into thin slices, flour them, and fry of a nice 
brown. When done, make a gravy in the pan by pouring 
away the fat, putting in a small piece of butter, ]^ pint of 
boiling water, pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of mush- 
room ketchup. Let the gravy just boil up, pour over the 
kidney and serve. 

Beefsteak Pie. Take three pounds of steak, seasoning 
to taste, of salt, cayenne and black pepper, 
crust, water and the yolk of an egg. Have 
the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a 
few days, that they may be tender, and be 
particular that every portion is perfectly sweet. Cut the 
steaks into pieces about three inches long and two wide, 
allowing a small piece of fat to each piece of lean, and 
arrange the meat in layers in a pie-dish. Between each 
layer sprinkle a seasoning of salt, pepper and, when liked, a 
few grains of cayenne. Fill the dish sufficiently with meat 
to support the crust, and to give it a nice raised appearance 
when baked, and not to look flat and hollow. Pour in 
sufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with 
paste (see Pastry) ; brush it over with a little water, and 
put on the cover; slightly press down the edges with the 
thumb, and trim off close to the dish. Ornament the pie 
with leaves or pieces of paste, cut in any shape that fancy 




Beefsteak Pie. 



34 Meat and How to Cook It 

may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg; 
make a hole in the top of the crust, and bake in a hot oven 
for about an hour and a half. The addition of some sheep's 
kidneys is an improvement; or, if these cannot be had, some 
bullock's kidney, cut up small, is almost as good, and forms 
an excellent gravy. 

Beef Cake. Take the remains of cold roast beef; to 
each pound of cold meat allow % lb. of bacon or ham; 
seasoning to taste, of pepper and salt, i small bunch of 
minced savory herbs, i or 2 eggs. Mince the beef very 
finely (if under done, it will be better), add to it the bacon, 
which must also be chopped very small, and mix well 
together. Season, stir in the herbs, and bind with an egg, 
or 2 should 1 not be sufficient. Make it into small square 
cakes, about half an inch thick, fry them in hot dripping, and 
serve in a dish with good gravy poured round them. 

Boiled Tongue. You need one tongue, a bunch of savory 

herbs and water. If the tongue is 
salted, it must be soaked in fresh 
water over night if fresh, salt 
must be added to the water in 
which it is boiled; when tender take out of the kettle, put 
in a pan, pour cold water over it, and peel off the skin, trim 
off the roots and tip, and serve. 

Stewed Ox-Tails. Procure 2 ox-tails, 1 onion, 3 cloves, 
1 blade of mace, % teaspoonful of whole black pepper, % 
teaspoonful of allspice, % teaspoonful of salt, a small 
bunch of savory herbs, thickening of butter and flour, 1 
tablespoonful of lemon juice, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom 
ketchup. Divide the tails at the joints, wash and put them 
into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and set 
them on the fire; when the water boils remove the scum, and 
add the onion cut into rings, the spice, seasoning and herbs. 
Cover the stewpan closely, and let the tails simmer very 





Meat and How to Cook It. 35 

gently until tender, which will be in about two and a half 
hours. Take them out, make a thickening of butter and 
flour, add it to the gravy, and let it boil for a quarter of an 
hour. Strain it through a sieve into a saucepan, put back 
the tails, add the lemon juice and ketchup; let the whole 
just boil up, and serve. Garnish with croutons or sippets 
of toasted bread. 

Potted Beef. You need the remains of cold roast or 
boiled beef, %. lb. of butter, cayenne to 
taste, 2 blades of pounded mace. Cut up 
the meat into small pieces and pound 
it well, with a little butter, in a mortar; 
add a seasoning of cayenne and mace, and be very particular 
that the latter ingredient is reduced to the finest powder. 
When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, put it into 
a glass or earthen potting pot, and pour over the top a coat- 
ing of clarified butter. 

Creamed Beef. Put a lump of butter the size of an 
egg in a frying pan, when it is melted add cold roast beef, 
cut in thin slices or chipped dried beef, and fry to a nice 
brown; then add a tablespoonful of flour, and stir well; last 
of all add enough water or milk to make a nice cream. You 
can serve on toast or not, as you please. 

Filet of Beef. A filet of beef is the tenderloin, but, 
as tenderloin is very expensive, a very good filet can be 
made from the "roll," which is simply the thick part of the 
rib separated from the bone. 

Directions for cooking a filet of beef will be found under 
the head of Roast Beef. 

Spiced Beef. Four pounds of round beef chopped fine; 
take from it all fat; add to it three dozen small crackers 
rolled fine, four eggs, one cup of milk, one tablespoonful 
ground mace, two tablespoonfuls of black pepper, one table- 
spoonful melted butter; mix well and put in any tin pan 
that it will just fill, packing it well; baste with butter and 
water, and bake two hours in a slow oven. 




VEAL. 




Filet of Veal 



Roast Veal. A loin of veal roasted makes a splendid 
dinner dish. Roast in a pan with some 
sliced vegetables, put a piece of bread in 
the pan, and it will cook to pieces and 
thicken the gravy; small pared potatoes 
baked with the meat in the same pan make a good vegetable 
to serve with veal ; both should be basted every few min- 
utes. 

Fricassee of Veal. The breast or shoulder of veal cut 
into pieces are the best for fricassee. Wash the veal and 
put on in cold water, let it come to a boil, take out the meat, 
wash again and put in fresh water once more, and let stew 
until done; mix a cupful of flour with half a cup of butter, 
dissolve this in the pan of veal, season with saLt and pepper, 
and serve. 

Breast of Veal Stuffed. Obtain a breast of veal, 
boned and opened; fill your breast 
loosely with a good bread stuffing, 
sew up the open end and braise in a 
pan with vegetables; as for roasting 
Breast of Veal. on b* keep your pan covered ; cook 

well done and make sauce in pan as for roast beef. 

Veal Loaf. Take three or four pounds of cold roast or 
boiled veal, that off the leg or loin is best; chop fine and 
mix in six rolled crackers, two eggs, a lump of butter the 

36 




Veal 37 

size of an egg, season with salt and pepper; mix all well 
together, and shape into a loaf covering the outside with 
cracker dust. Bake forty-five minutes. To be eaten cold. 

Veal Cutlet Broiled. Season the cutlet with salt and 
pepper, put in a double wire broiler and cook over a quick 
fire; baste several times with a little melted butter, and serve 
hot. 

Veal Cutlet Fried. Season the cutlet with salt and 
pepper, and let stand a few minutes before 
frying; then dip in beaten egg and then 
in cracker dust; fry in hot butter or pork 
fat; cook slowly until well done. Serve 
Veal cutiet. with tomato sauce. 

Veal Curry. Cut two pounds of lean veal in pieces, 
put in a pan with a piece of butter, size of an egg, and let it 
fry to a nice brown; then mix in a large tablespoonful of 
flour, a teaspoonf ul of curry powder, salt and pepper; when 
all are well mixed, add a pint of hot water, and let it boil 
about twenty minutes, skimming off all fat. Rice croquettes 
are nice served with this dish. 




Boiled Calf's Head. 




Procure one calf's head, without 
the skin, water, a little salt, 4 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
1 tablespoonful of minced pars- 
ley, pepper and salt to taste, 1 
Calf's Head. tablespoonful of lemon juice. 

After the head has been thoroughly cleaned, and the brains 
removed, soak it in water to blanch it. Lay the brains also 
in warm water to soak, and let them remain for about an 
hour. Put the head into a stewpan with sufficient cold 
water to cover it, and when it boils, add a little salt; take 
off every particle of scum as it rises, and boil the head until 
perfectly tender. Boil the brains, chop them, and mix with 



38 Veal 

them melted butter, minced parsley, pepper, salt and lemon 
juice in the above proportion. Take up the head, skin the 
tongue, and put it on a small dish with the brains round it. 
Have ready some parsley and butter, smother the head with 
it, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Bacon, ham, 
pickled pork, or a pig's cheek are indispensable with calf's 
head. The brains are sometimes chopped with hard-boiled 
eggs, and mixed with a little French white sauce. 

Calfs Liver Sausages. Use ^ lb. of fat bacon, i lb. 
of calf's liver, x /z lb. of bread crumbs, 3 eggs, 1 bay leaf, ^ 
teaspoonful of thyme, % teaspoonful of grated lemon peel, 
% teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful 
of parsley, ^teaspoonful of pepper. Mince the bacon and liver 
finely, then add the remaining ingredients 
and incorporate thoroughly. Beat the 
eggs thoroughly, then moisten the mixture 
with them and encase it in the skins; fry 
them with a little butter or lard in the 
pan, of a nice rich brown, pricking the 
skins with a fork to prevent their burst- 
ing. Serve on toast or with mashed 

The Lemon Thyme. potatoes. 

Broiled Kidneys. Split veal kidneys lengthwise, remov- 
ing all fat, and broil over a clear fire for twelve or fifteen 
minutes; baste with butter while broiling, season with salt, 
pepper, butter and a little chopped parsley. Serve hot. 

Stewed Kidneys. Take beef kidney, remove all fat, 
and wash clean ; put in a stew pan, cover with cold water and 
boil for one hour. Put half a cupful of butter in a frying 
pan with a small onion minced fine; when frying put in the 
kidneys, turning them over until they are a nice brown; then 
add a tablespoonful of flour, stir in thoroughly, and add 
enough of the hot stock to make a thick sauce, add half a 
can of -mushrooms, season with salt, pepper, a tablespoonful 




Veal 39 

of Worcestershire sauce and a glass of sherry. Serve on 
toast. 

Veal and Ham Pie. You need 2 lbs. of cutlets, l /> lb. of 
boiled ham, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced savory herbs, % 
teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 2 blades of pounded mace, 
pepper and salt to taste, a strip of lemon peel finely minced, 
the yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs, % pint of water, nearly % 
pint of good strong gravy, puff-crust. Cut the veal into 
nice square pieces, and put a layer of them at the bottom of 
a pie dish; sprinkle over these a portion of the herbs, 
spices, seasoning, lemon peel, and the yolks of the eggs cut 
in slices; cut the ham very thin, and put a layer of this in. 
Proceed in this manner until the dish is full, so arranging 
it that the ham comes at the top. Lay a puff-paste on the 
edge of the dish, and pour in about half a pint of water; 
cover with crust, ornament it with leaves, brush it over with 
the yolk of an egg, and bake in a well-heated oven for 1 to 
i x /i hour, or longer, should the pie be very large. When it 
is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top through a funnel 
nearly half a pint of strong gravy; this should be made 
sufficiently good that, when cold, it may cut in a firm jelly. 
This pie may be very much enriched by adding a few mush- 
rooms, oysters, or sweet-breads; but it will be found very 
good without any of the last-named additions. 

Fricandeau of Veal. You need a piece of the fat side 
of a leg of veal (about 3 lbs.), lardoons (strips of bacon cut 
for larding), 2 carrots, 2 large onions, 1 faggot of savory 
herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay- 
leaves, pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 pint of 
stock. The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best 
quality, or it will not be good. It may be known by the 
meat being white and not thready. Take off the skin, flat- 
ten the veal on the table, then, at one stroke of the knife, cut 
off as much as is required, for a fricandeau with an uneven 



40 




Veal 

surface never looks well. Trim it, 
and with a sharp knife make two or 
three slits in the middle, that it may 
taste more of the seasoning. Now 
lard it thickly with fat bacon, as 
Fricandeau of Veal. lean gives a red color to the frican- 

deau. Slice the vegetables and put these, with the herbs and 
spices, in the middle of a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon 
at the top ; these should form a sort of mound in the centre 
for the veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau over the 
bacon, etc., without touching the veal. Let it gradually 
come to a boil ; then put it over a slow and equal fire, and 
let it simmer very gently for about 2^ hours, or longer 
should it be very large. Baste it frequently with the liquor, 
and a short time before serving, put it into a brisk oven, to 
make the bacon firm, which otherwise would break when it 
was glazed. Dish the fricandeau, keep it hot, skim off the 
fat from the liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze, with 
which glaze the fricandeau, and serve with. a puree of what- 
ever vegetable happens to be in season — spinach, sorrel, 
asparagus, cucumbers, peas, etc.

PORK 

Roast Pork. Take five or six pounds of the loin, wash 
clean and dredge with salt and pepper, 
fes. a little flour, and a teaspoonful of 
g=^ powdered sage; put in a pan with a 
Roast Pork. teacupful of water and roast two hours. 

Pork Tenderloin Broiled. Have your butcher either 
split the tenderloin lengthwise or cut crosswise and flatten; 
put on a wire-broiler and cook over a clear fire; when done 
put in a pan with a lump of butter and let the juice of the 
meat and the butter come to a boil. This makes a delicious 
sauce; season with salt and pepper and serve hot. 

Salt Pork. Cut into slices, put in a pan, pour on cold 
water and let come to a boil. This, unless the pork is very- 
salt, will freshen sufficiently. Take out the pork, throw 
the water away, roll the pork in flour, and fry to a nice 
brown. Serve with cream gravy. 

Freshen as above, make a batter of 
one beaten egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
milk and one of flour, well beaten 
together, put a little fat in the fry-

Pork and Beans. Soak two pounds of beans in cold 
water over night, wash thoroughly, put in a pot or jar in 
which they are to be baked, cover with clear stock, put a 
piece of freshened salt pork on top and bake in a moderate 
oven for six hours, add water from time to time as the beans 
cook dry. Another way to bake beans is to soak over night, 
put in the pot next morning with a piece of salt pork and 
boil until done, strain the liquor off the beans, stir in two

a dressing with a glass of wine, some of the stuffing, and 
the drippings. When the pig is done, put on a platter, put

a lemon or apple in its mouth, and serve with the sauce. 

Baked Pork Tenderloin. Split the tenderloin through 
lengthwise; make a stuffing of bread, seasoned with salt, 
pepper and some kind of sweet herb, stuff the tenderloin and 
tie a string around it to keep the filling in, add a cupful of 
water and bake some forty to fifty minutes; baste frequently. 

If the ham is quite salt and has been 
cured some time, it will require soak- 
ing from ten to twenty-four hours, 
during which the water should be

has been soaked sufficiently, scrape and clean thoroughly, 
cutting away any part that may be rusty or discolored. Put 
the ham in any vessel suitable for boiling it and cover 
plentifully with water; let it come to a boil very slowly and 
skim off the scum as it rises. When it boils clear, set the 
pot on the back of the stove and let it simmer slowly but 
steadily until done, then take out of the liquor, strip off the 
skin, dust with cracker or bread crumbs and put in the oven 
and brown. 

Pig's Feet Broiled. Pig's feet should be boiled for 
about six hours. When cold, split in two and broil on a 
wire broiler over a clear fire, baste with butter, seam with 
salt and pepper and serve. 

Fried Pig's Feet. Boil the pig's feet and when cold 
split open, dip in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs and fry 
in hot fat and serve with tomato sauce. 

Fried Sausages. Prick the sausages with a fork (this 
prevents them from bursting), and put them into a frying 
pan with a small piece of butter. Keep moving the pan 
about, and turn the sausages three or four times. In from 
10 to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently cooked, unless 
the)- are very large, when a little more time should be 



44 Pork 

allowed for them. Dish them with or without a piece of 
toast under them, and serve very hot. In some countries, 
sausages are boiled and served on toast. They should be 
plunged into boiling water, and simmered for about 10 
or 12 minutes. 

Note. — Sometimes, in close, warm weather, sausages very soon turn 
sour; to prevent this, put them in the oven for a few minutes with a small 
piece of butter to keep them moist. When wanted for table, they will not 
require so long frying as uncooked sausages. 

Hani and Eggs. Have the ham cut in very thin slices, 
cut off rind and any imperfections or discolorations that may 
be in the meat and fry carefully until done, remove to a 
platter and break the eggs one at a time in a saucer and 
then slip it into the hot fat, being careful not to break the 
yolk. Do not turn the eggs over, but baste the hot grease 
over them; to cook the top; when done, lay around the ham, 
pour on the gravy, and serve. 

Breakfast Bacon. Cut nice bacon in thin slices and 
fry to a crisp. This is nice to serve with calf's liver. 

Boiled Bacon. As bacon is frequently excessively salt, 
let it be soaked in warm water for an 
hour or two previous to dressing it ; then 
pare off the rusty parts, and scrape 
Boiled Bacon. under-side and rind, as clean as possible. 
Put it into a saucepan of cold water, let it come gradually to 
a boil, and as fast as the scum rises to the surface of the 
water, remove it. Let it simmer very gently until it is 
thoroughly done; then take it up, strip off the skin, and 
sprinkle over the bacon a few bread-raspings, and garnish 
with tufts of cauliflower or Brussels sprouts. When served 
alone, young and tender broad beans or green peas are the 
usual accompaniments. 

Collared Pig's Face. (A breakfast or luncheon dish.) 
You need one pig's face; salt. For brine, i gallon of spring 





Pork 45 

water, i lb. of common salt, y 2 handful of chopped juniper 
berries, 6 bruised cloves, 2 bay-leaves, a few sprigs of 
thyme, basil, sage, # oz. of saltpeter. For forcemeat, }4 
lb. of ham, x /z lb. of bacon, 1 teaspoonful of mixed spices, 
pepper to taste, % lb. of lard, 1 tablespoonful of minced 
parsley, 6 young onions. Singe the head carefully, bone it 
without breaking the skin, and rub it well with salt. 
Make the brine by boiling the above 
ingredients for a quarter of an hour, 
and letting it stand to cool. When 
cold, pour it over the head, and let it 
Pig'sFace. steep in this for 10 days, turning and 

rubbing it often. Then wipe, drain and dry it. For the 
forcemeat, pound the ham and bacon very finely, and mix 
with these the remaining ingredients, taking care that the 
whole is thoroughly incorporated. Spread this equally over 
the head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind it securely with 
broad tape. Put it into a saucepan with a few meat trim- 
mings, and cover it with stock, let it simmer gently for four 
hours, and be particular that it does not stop boiling the 
whole time. When quite tender, take it up, put it between 
two dishes and a heavy weight on top, and when cold, remove 
the cloth and tape. It should be sent to table on a napkin, 
or garnished with a piece of deep white paper, with a ruche 
at the top. 

Pork Chops. You need a loin or fore-loin of pork, egg 
and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste; to every table- 
spoonful of bread crumbs allow }i teaspoonful of minced 
sage; clarified butter. Cut the cutlets from a loin or fore- 
loin of pork; trim them the same as mutton cutlets, and 
scrape the top part of the bone. Brush them over with egg, 
sprinkle with bread crumbs, with which have been mixed 
minced sage and a seasoning of pepper and salt; drop a 
little clarified butter on them, and press the crumbs well 



46 Pork 

down. Put the frying pan on the fire, put in some lard; 
when, this is hot, lay in the cutlets, and fry them a light 
brown on both sides. Take them out, put them before the 
fire to dry the greasy moisture from them, and dish them on 
mashed potatoes. Serve with them any sauce that may be 
preferred, such as tomato sauce : sauce piquante, or pickled 
gherkins. 

Roast Leg of Pork. Take a leg of pork, a little oil, 
stuffing of sage and onions. Choose a small leg of pork, 
and score the skin across in narrow strips, about a quarter of 
an inch apart. Cut a slit in the knuckle, loosen the skin, 
and fill it with a sage and onion stuffing. Brush the joint 
over with a little salad oil (this makes the crackling crisper, 
and a better color), and put it down to a bright, clear fire, 
not too near, as that would cause the skin to blister. Baste 
it well, and serve with a little gravy made in the dripping 
pan, and do not omit to send to the table with it a tureen of 
well made apple sauce. 

To Bake a Ham. You need a ham ; a common crust. 
As a ham for baking should be well soa'ked, let it remain in 
the water for at least 12 hours. Wipe it dry, trim away any 
rusty places underneath, and cover it with a common crust, 
taking care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep 
the gravy in.- Place it in a moderately-heated oven, and 
bake for nearly 4 hours. Take off the crust, and skin, and 
cover with raspings, the same as for boiled ham, and garnish 
the knuckle with a paper frill. This method of cooking 
ham is, by many persons, considered far superior to boiling 
it, as it cuts fuller of gravy and has a finer flavor, besides 
keeping a much longer time good.

MUTTON AND LAMB 

Roast Mutton. Wash and wipe dry a nice leg of 

mutton ; with salt, pepper and flour, 

put in the dripping pan with a little 

water. Baste frequently with the 

drippings. Cook from an hour and 

Roast Mutton. a quarter to an hour and a half. A 

few vegetables sliced in the pan always improve the flavor 

of the roast. 

Irish Stew. Blanch three pounds of mutton chops by 
dipping alternately in hot and cold water, put in a stewpan 
and barely cover with water; let come to a boil; skim care- 
fully; season with salt, parsley, mace and a few whole pepper 
corns, boil half an hour; then add a quart of small onions, 
boil half an hour longer, and add a quart of small potatoes;

put in the carrots, onions, herbs, parsley, and seasoning, and 
over these place the mutton. Cover the whole with a few 
more slices of bacon and the veal trimmings, pour in the 
gravy or water, and stew very gently for 4 hours. Strain the 
gravy, reduce it to a glaze over a sharp fire, glaze the mutton 
with it, and send it to table; place on a dish of white haricot 
beans boiled tender, or garnished with glazed onions. 

Roast Saddle of Mutton. To insure this joint being 
tender, let it hang for ten days or a 
fortnight, if the weather permits. 
Cut off the tail and flaps, and trim 
away every part that has not in- 
disputable pretensions to be eaten, 
Saddle of Mutton. an d have the skin taken off and 

skewered on again. Put it down to a bright, clear fire, and 
when the joint has been cooking for an hour, remove the 
skin and dredge it with flour. It should not be placed too 
near the fire, as the fat should not be in the slightest degree 
burned, but kept constantly basted, both before and after the 
skin is removed. Sprinkle some salt over the joint; make a 
little gravy in the dripping pan; pour it over the meat, which 
send to table with a tureen of made gravy and red currant 
jelly. 

Haricot of Mutton. The breast or shoulder of mutton 
is generally used for a haricot. 
Put your meat with a lump of butter 
in a roasting pan and put in the 
oven and roast to a nice brown; 
Shoulder of Mutton. transfer to a saucepan, cover with 

stock, and let boil; cut a carrot or nice sweet turnip into 
regular shaped pieces and let them boil with the mutton; 
also prepare a few small onions and put in the stew whole; 
pare and cut some potatoes the same shape as the other 
vegetables, and put in stew ; season with salt and pepper, a

little Worcestershire sauce, and a glass of sherry. This stew 
should have a nice brown color. If the sauce is too thin 
thicken with a little flour. 

Roast Saddle of Lamb. This joint is now very much 
in vogue, and is generally considered a nice one for a small 
party. Have ready a clear, brisk fire, and put down the joint 
at a little distance, to prevent the fat from scorching; keep 
it well basted all the time it is cooking. Serve with mint 
sauce and a fresh salad, and send to table with it either peas, 
cauliflowers, or spinach. 

Breast of Mutton Fried. Cut a two- inch square 
out of the breast and boil until very 
tender; lay the pieces on a platter and 
draw the bones out very carefully; 
Roast Lamb. after boning the pieces lay in a pan, 

cover with a plate, put a weight on top, and press until cold; 
cut into squares suitable for serving, dip in beaten egg, then

sauce and string beans. 

Scotch Haggis. You need a sheep's pluck and stomach, 
}4 lb. of suet, Yz lb. of oatmeal, an onion, pepper and salt. 
Have the stomach bag properly cleaned by the butcher, wash 
it well and put it in a saucepan of cold water and bring to 
the boil, which will make the bag contract. Take it out of 
the water at once, wash and scrape it well and lay it in salt 
and water. Wash the pluck thoroughly and boil it gently 
for one hour and a half with the windpipe hanging out over 
the edge of the pot that all impurities may escape through it. 
Take all gristly parts from the lungs and heart, and mince 
the remainder, grate the best parts of the liver, chop the suet 
and onion fine, toast the oatmeal in the oven and put all in a 
basin, with a dessertspoonful of salt and rather less than half 
the quantity of pepper. Moisten with half a pint of the 
liquor in which the pluck was boiled. Take the stomach

bag from the brine, and keeping the smooth side inside, fill 
it with the mixture (not quite full) and sew it up. Put the 
haggis in a pot of boiling water and boil gently for 3 hours, 
with a plate under to prevent it from sticking, and prick it 
now and then with a needle to prevent its bursting. 

Kidneys on Toast. Procure 2 sheep's kidneys, or 1^ 
lb. of bullock's kidney, 1 oz. of butter, 
cayenne, a squeeze of lemon, salt, 2 slices 
Kidneys on Toast. of hot buttered toast. Stew the kidneys 
with a very little water until tender, remove the skin and 
gristle, and pound smooth in a mortar, with the butter, lemon 
juice, salt and cayenne to taste. Spread the mixture on the 
toast, which should be buttered on both sides, and put in the 
oven to get hot through. 

Breast of Lamb and Green Peas. Remove the skin 
from a breast of lamb, put it into a saucepan of boiling water, 
and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Take it out and lay it in 
cold water. Line the bottom of a stewpan with a few thin 
slices of bacon; lay the lamb on these; peel the lemon, cut it 
into slices, and put these on the meat, to keep it white and 
make it tender; cover 'with 1 or 2 more slices of bacon; add 
a pint of stock, onion, and herbs, and set it on a slow fire to 
simmer very gently until tender. Have ready some green 
peas, put these on a dish, and place the lamb on the top of 
these. The appearance of this dish may be much improved 
by glazing the lamb, and spinach may be substituted for the 
peas when variety is desired. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. Cut the chops from a well- 
hung, tender loin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat, 
and trim them into a nice shape; slightly beat and level 
them; place the gridiron over a bright, clear fire, rub the 
bars with a little fat, and lay on the chops. Whilst broiling 
frequently turn them, and in about 8 minutes they will be 
done. Season with pepper and salt, dish them on a very hot 



Mutton and Lamb 51 

dish, rub a small piece of butter on each chop, and serve very 
hot and expeditiously. 

Lamb Chops Saute with Peas. Trim the lamb 
chops neatly and evenly, place in a frying pan with a 
little butter, season with salt and pepper, and fry to a nice 
brown ; when done arrange on a platter alternating each chop 
with a nicely browned piece of toast ; strain the water off a 
can of French peas, put in a pan with a piece of butter, 
season with salt and pepper, stir until hot, and pour in the 
middle of platter. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. Select a nice leg of mutton, 
cut off the shank bone, wash and put 
in a pot with a handful of salt, cover 
with water and let it come to a boil, 
skim until clear; then set the pot 
on the back part of the stove and let 
boil very slowly until tender; it will take from two to three 
hours. Serve with caper sauce or drawn butter gravy.

Turkey Stuffed with Oysters. Select a nice plump 
turkey, draw and wash thoroughly. Prepare stuffing in the 
following manner: Take a pint of oysters, put in a pan and 
stew in their own liquor, drain off the liquor and cut the 

oysters into bits, 
add half a cup of 
butter, a shred-

three pints of stale bread crumbs with the oyster liquor, add 
the oysters and onion, break in three eggs, season with salt 
and pepper, and mix all thoroughly together; if the stuffing 
is too dry, add some milk; if otherwise, add more bread crumbs; 
stuff the turkey, sew up the openings, take some butter in the 
hand and rub over the outside, dredge with salt, pepper and 
flour, put in a pan with a pint of water, place in the oven 
and wash. No time can be given, as so much depends upon 
the age, size and condition of the fowl. A large turkey a 
year old will take as much, as three and a half, four, or even 
five hours of slow roasting; while a younger and smaller one 
may not require more than half that time. Baste every ten 
or fifteen minutes. 

Stuffed Turkey, Giblet Sauce. Stuff a turkey with 
the following dressing: Take stale bread and cut in pieces,

Smothered Chicken. Cut a young chicken into joints, 
wash, and put in a frying pan, with half a cup of butter and 
the same measure of water; season with salt and cover 
closely; let cook until the water boils dry, let the chicken 
fry brown on both sides, take out and lay on a platter, put a 
tablespoonful of flour in the frying pan, cook till slightly 
brown, then add to it a cupful of milk or water, stir smooth. 
This will make a delicious brown gravy, pour over the 
chicken, set in the oven for a moment and serve. 

Broiled Chicken. Only young chickens are suitable for 
broiling. Draw the chicken and split it down the back, 
wash clean, lay it on the board and break down the breast 
bone by pressing with the rolling pin, put on a double wire 
broiler, season with salt and broil over a clear fire, presenting 
the inside to the fire first. Baste with melted butter while 
broiling, and serve as soon as done. 

Chicken Pie. Cut up two chickens and boil, putting on 
just enough water to cover them, and season with salt and 
pepper, skim carefully; when tender, rub two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour in half a cup of butter and add this to the stew. 
Line an earthen pan with a rich crust, put in the chicken, 
gravy and all, cover with crust, pinching down the sides, 
cut an opening in the center for the steam to escape, and 
bake one hour.

Chicken Pot Pie. Prepare chicken as for pie, but have 
more gravy, put in the crust (see directions for making) and 
boil twenty minutes; when done place the chicken in the 
middle of a platter, place the crust around it, pour some of 
the gravy over all, and serve the rest in a gravy boat. 

Pressed Chicken. Boil nice plump chickens until 
tender; take off the skin ? and pick the meat off the bones; 
pick the meat up fine (do not chop) season with salt and 
pepper, and add a head of celery, cut fine; mix all well to-

cover with a plate, put a weight on top and set away. 
When cold, cut in slices, and garnish with parsley. 

Boiled Fowl and Rice. Take 1 fowl, mutton broth, 

2 onions, 2 small blades of pounded mace, pepper and sak 
to taste, Y\ pint of rice, parsley and butter. Truss the fowl 
as for boiling, and put it into a stewpan with sufficient clear, 
well-skimmed mutton broth to cover it; add the onion, mace, 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt; stew very gently for 
about one hour, should the fowl be large, and about half an 
hour before it is ready put in the rice, which should be well 
washed and soaked. When the latter is tender, strain it 
from the liquor, and put it on a sieve reversed to dry before 
the fire, and in the meantime, keep the fowl hot. Dish it, 
put the rice round as a border, pour a little parsley and 
butter over the fowl, and the remainder send to table in a 
tureen.

butter rolled in flour; puff paste. Mince very small the 
white meat from a cold roast fowl, after removing all the 
skin; weigh it, and to every quarter of a pound of meat 
allow the above proportion of minced ham. Put these into a 
stewpan with the remaining ingredients, stir over the fire for 
to minutes or a quarter of an hour, taking care that the 
mixture does not burn. Roll out some puff paste about a 
quarter of an inch in thickness; line the patty pans with 
this, put upon each a small piece of bread, and cover with 
another layer of paste; brush over with the yolk of an egg, 
and bake in a brisk oven for about a quarter of an hour. 
When done, cut a round piece out of the top, and with a 
small spoon, take out the bread (be particular in not break- 
ing the outside border of the crust), and fill the patties with 
the mixture. 

Roast Pigeons. Clean and stuff the birds, and pack in

birds will roast in from one-half to three-quarters of an hour. 

Note. — Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh (if kept a little, the 
flavor goes off), and they should be drawn as soon as killed. Cut off the 
heads and necks, truss the wings over the back, and cut off the toes at the 
first joint; previous to trussing, they should be carefully cleaned, as no bird 
requires so much washing.

shalots, or a little garlic may be added, if approved. 

Roast Partridge. When the bird is firmly and plumply 

trussed, roast it before a nice bright 

fire; keep it well basted, and a few 

minutes before serving, flour and froth 

Roast Partridge. it well. Dish it, and serve with 

gravy and bread sauce, and send to table hot and quickly. 

\ little of the gravy should be poured over the bird. 

Roast Rabbit. Dress and clean the rabbit thoroughly, 
and soak in salt and water. Put in a dripping pan and 
dredge with salt, pepper and a little flour. Cut salt pork in 
thin strips and fasten on the rabbit with toothpicks, spread 
some butter over all, put a little water in the pan and roast 
in the oven until done, basting often. You can make a 
stuffing as for chicken, fill the rabbit, and then roast as 
above, if you choose. 

Fried Rabbit. Dress and clean the rabbit and cut up 

in pieces suitable to serve, let it 
stand in salt and water until 
white, put in a kettle and boil 
until tender, take out of the 
liquor and let it stand until it 
stops steaming. Have the fry- 
ing pan half full of hot drip- 
pings or lard, dip the rabbit in beaten egg, then in cracker 
dust and fry in the hot fat ; serve at once. 

Stewed Rabbit. Take 1 rabbit, 2 large onions, 6 
cloves, 1 small teaspoonful of chopped lemon peel, a few 
forcemeat balls, thickening of butter and Hour, 1 large 
tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. Cut the rabbit into 
small joints; put them into a stewpan, add the onions sliced, 
the cloves, and minced lemon peel. Pour in sufficient water

to cover the meat, and when the rabbit is nearly done, drop 
in a few forcemeat balls, to which the liver has been added, 
finely chopped. Thicken the gravy with flour and butter, 
put in the ketchup, give one boil, and serve. 

Roast Venison. Either the saddle or leg are fine for 

roasting. Have your 

market man lard the 

venison for you, then put 

in the dripping pan with 

Roast venison. half a pint of water and 

good sized lump of butter; dredge with salt and pepper and 

roast in a hot oven from two to three hours, basting every 

ten or fifteen minutes. 

Broiled Venison. Put the venison steaks in the double 
wire broiler and broil over a clear fire. When done place on 
a hot platter, season with salt and pepper and pour over it 
some hot butter, turn it over and put on more of the butter, 
and serve at once. 

Jugged Hare. Need i hare, 1^2 lb. of gravy beef, % 
lb. of butter, 1 onion, 1 lemon, 6 cloves, pepper, cayenne, 
and salt to taste, % pint of port, good turkey stuffing. Skin, 
paunch and wash the hare, cut it into pieces, dredge them 
with flour, and fry in boiling butter. Have ready 1% pint 
of gravy, made from the above proportion of beef, and 
thickened with a little flour. Put this into a jar; add the 
pieces of fried hare, an onion stuck with six cloves, a lemon 
peeled and cut in half, and a good seasoning of pepper, 
cayenne and salt; cover the jar down tightly, put it up to 
the neck in a stewpan of boiling water, and let it stew until 
the hare is quite tender. When nearly done, pour in the 
wine, and add a few stuffing balls; these must be fried or 
baked in the oven for a few minutes before they are put to 
the gravy. Serve with red currant jelly. 



Poultry and Game 61 

Larded Grouse. Clean and wash the grouse. Lard 
the breast and legs. Put a small skewer into the legs and 
through the tail. Tie firmly with twine. Dredge with 
salt, and rub the breast with soft butter; then dredge thickly 
with flour. Put into a quick oven. If it be very rare, cook 
twenty minutes; if wished better done, thirty minutes. The 
former time, as a general thing, suits gentlemen better, but 
thirty minutes is preferred by ladies. If the birds are 
cooked in a tin kitchen, it should be for thirty or thirty-five 
minutes. When done, place on a hot dish on which has been 
spread bread sauce. Sprinkle fried crumbs over both grouse 
and sauce. Garnish with parsley. The grouse, may, in- 
stead, be served on a hot dish, with the parsley garnish, and 
the sauce and crumbs served in separate dishes. The first 
method is the better, however, as you get in the sauce all the 
gravy that comes from the birds. 

Grand Pacific Game Pie. Take about two dozen of 
woodcock, quail, snipe, or other small birds. Split each one 
in half and put them into a saucepan containing about a 
gallon of cold water, although beef broth or soup stock 
would be preferable. See that the fire is hot, and when the 
boiling point has been reached, carefully skim off all the 
scum from the surface, and put in for seasoning a little pep- 
per and salt with mace, ground cloves and one bay leaf, ad- 
ding half a pound slice of salt pork cut into squares, two 
small carrots and one onion. Boil until tender, being care- 
ful that there is enough broth to cover the game. Into 
another saucepan put four ounces of butter and two table- 
spoonfuls browned flour, mixing well and stirring into it a 
part of the broth or gravy so as to make a thin sauce. Strain 
off what broth remains in the first saucepan, removing there- 
from the vegetables and spices to go with the sauce. Slice, 
and cut into dice shape, potatoes equal in quantity to the 
meat, and put in a deep baking dish; put on the top crust of 



62 Poultry and Game 

dough and bake in an oven that is not too hot. If a separate 
pie is desired for each person the baking may be done in 
small vegetable dishes. 

Pigeon Pie. Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub 
the outside with a mixture o f pepper and salt; rub the 
inside with a bit of butter, and fill it with a bread-and-but- 
ter stuffing, or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, butter the 
sides of a tin basin or pudding-dish, and line (the sides 
only) with pie paste, rolled to quarter of an inch thickness, 
lay the birds in; for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of 
a pound of sweet butter and put it over them, strew over a 
large teaspoonful of salt and a small teaspoonful of pepper, 
with a bunch of finely-cut parsley, if liked; dredge a large 
teaspoonful of wheat flour; put in water to nearly fill the 
pie; lay skewers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust;* 
cut a slit in the middle, ornament the edge with leaves, 
braids, or shells of paste, and put in a moderately hot or 
quick oven for one hour; when nearly done, brush the top 
with the yolk of an egg beaten with a little milk, and finish. 
The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or more pieces, 
jf preferred. 

Any small birds may be done in this manner. 

A Brine for Beef, Bacon, Ham and Venison. For 

each one hundred pounds of meat, use six pounds of salt, six 
pounds of sugar, and four ounces of saltpeter. Dissolve all 
in enough water to cover the meat. Sprinkle a little salt 
over the bottom of the cask before packing the meat. Be 
sure the brine covers the meat for six weeks. Smoke the 
ham and bacon, and if kept in hot weather sew in sacks and 
whitewash.

MISCELLANEOUS DISHES 

Boiled New England Dinner. Take a piece of salt 
pork and another of corned beef, the size must depend on the 
number of persons to be served ; about three pounds of each 
will be sufficient for a family of six. Wash the meat and 
put on fire in separate kettles, boiling slowly for an hour; 
take the meat out and pour the liquor from one kettle into 
the other; put fresh water into the empty kettle, put in both 
pieces of meat and boil for two hours longer. Skim nearly 
all the fat off the liquor in which the meat was first boiled, 
taste it and if too salt to boil vegetables in, pour off some 
and add fresh water. Cut in quarters a small cabbage, one 
large or two small turnips, three or four carrots and peel six 
or eight potatoes, and boil all together in the liquor. In 
winter, all the vegetables except the potatoes, will require 
from one and three-quarters to two hours' boiling; in sum- 
mer about one hour will do; potatoes will boil done in thirty 
or forty minutes. If you wish to add beets to the dinner, 
they must be boiled in a separate vessel. When the dinner 
is done, put the beef and pork on the same platter; drain 
the vegetables in a colander and put on the table in covered 
vegetable dishes. Serve the dinner hot. Prepared mus- 
tard and grated horseradish are indispensable to a boiled 
dinner. 

Tripe. Tripe can be cut in squares and boiled over a 
quick fire, seasoning with butter, salt and pepper; or it can 
be boiled tender and then fried in butter, seasoning with 
salt and pepper. 

Potted Meats. Take nice lean meat, beef or veal is 
the best; cut in small squares, put in a kettle, cover with 
water, add a little salt and boil until tender. When done

64 Miscellaneous Dishes 

take out the meat and put in an earthen or stone dish. 
Season the stock with salt and pepper, a small lump of butter, a 
stick of cinnamon and a dozen peppercorns; add half a box 
gelatine dissolved in a little cold water; boil twenty or 
thirty minutes, strain, and pour over the meat, mix thoroughly, 
cover with a plate, put on a weight and set away. When 
cold cut in slices, garnish with parsley or celery, and serve. 
This is very nice for luncheon or tea. 

Broiled Sweet Breads. Trim and wash the sweet 
breads and broil on a wire broiler 
over a clear fire ; baste with butter and 
season with salt and pepper; serve hot. 

Sweet Breads No. 2. After trimming and washing 
the sweet breads, put in a stew pan, cover with water, add a 
pinch of salt and boil until done. Then take up and set 
aside until they stop steaming, then split, dip in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs and fry in equal parts of butter and 
fat. Serve hot. Tomato sauce is a nice addition. 

Calf's Liver. Cut the liver in slices, season with salt 
and pepper, dip in flour and fry in equal parts of butter and 
drippings. When nicely browned, lay on a platter; put a 
spoonful of flour in the frying pan and brown in the fat in 
which the liver was fried; add a teacupful of water, stir 
smooth and pour over the liver. 

Mock Duck. Take a round of beefsteak, season with 
salt and pepper; prepare a dressing as for turkey, spread over 
the steak, roll and sew it up; fasten three or four slices of 
fat pork on the roll with toothpicks; put in the oven and 
roast. Baste often. This dish is hard to distinguish from 
duck. 

Pot Pie. Take lean veal, beef, chicken, or any meat suita- 
ble for pot pie and cut up in pieces of a size suitable to serve. 
Wash, cover with cold water, and boil until tender. Skim 
when it first begins to boil. When done season with butter, 



Miscellaneous Dishes 65 

pepper and salt. About twenty minutes before serving, add 
the crust. 

Crust for Pot Pie. Take four and one-half cupfuls 
of flour and add to it two even teaspoonsful of cream tartar, and 
two even teaspoonfuls of soda and one teaspoonful of salt. 
Sift twice, then rub in a piece of butter the size of a walnut. 
Mix with two scant cupfuls of buttermilk, work into dough 
with as little handling as possible, roll out and cut as you 
would biscuit; put into the kettle and .boil for twenty 
minutes. 

Crust for Raised Pies. (For all Pies with Jelly.) 
Boil lard, good and fine, in water; add as much excellent 
dripping as there is lard; there must not be much of either. 
When still hot, mix it with as much flour as you have calcu- 
lated will do for your purpose. Make the paste stiff and 
smooth by kneading, and also by beating it with a rolling- 
pin. When perfectly smooth, put a ball of it by in a cloth 
till cold, then use. 

Ham Sandwiches. Chop cold, lean ham very fine; cut 
bread in thin slices and spread with butter; put on a layer 
of the chopped ham, season with prepared mustard, cover 
with another. 

Oyster Sandwiches. Pound the oysters with lemon 
juice and cayenne, lay them between the slices of bread and 
butter and cut into small neat sandwiches, which arrange on 
a silver plate, one over the other in a ring, like cutlets. 

Larding. All dry meats such as venison, a leg of veal, 
fillet of beef, grouse, partridge, etc., 
are much improved by larding. To 
— . some housekeepers this has a formi- 
Lardino- Needle. dable sound, but it is nothing more 

or less than drawing strips of fat salt pork through the sur- 
face of the meat. For this a larding needle is a convenience, 
5 




66 Miscellaneous Dishes 

but very good work can be done with a small, sharp knife. 
For a fillet of beef, cut fat salt pork in strips half an inch 
square by three or four inches long, and put a row on each 
side; take the stitches about half an inch deep and leave 
about half an inch of pork exposed at each end. A leg of 
veal can be larded much the same way, or game, sweetbreads, 
etc. The strips must be only one-quarter the size they are 
for beef, veal, or venison. 

Nudeln. (German Macaroni.) Needed 4 eggs, flour, milk, 
2 oz. of butter, grated rusk. With 4 eggs and 4 dessert- 
spoonfuls of milk, mix sufficient finest flour to make a paste; 
knead on a pasteboard, constantly shaking flour over it, until 
it becomes a stiff dough. Cut into four pieces, roll out as 
-fl^rf^^v thin as paper, and throw over a

hour, cut each piece again in four, 
lay the pieces upon each other, 
Nudein. roll up and cut into strips the 

width of a blade of grass, and shake them apart. They are 
then ready for use, but can be kept for several weeks. When 
required, boil tender in plenty of boiling water with salt, 
turn into a drainer, and pour boiling water quickly over 
them. Serve up either with brown butter, or sauce made 
with milk, salt and 2 oz. of fresh butter, and cover over with 
grated rusk, or a portion of the nudeln fried in butter until 
it has become crisp and brown. Nudeln are eaten with roast 
veal, or fowl, or ham, or as a sweet with stewed prunes or 
apple compote. 

Fried Bananas. Cut the bananas in slices and flour 
each, fry a light brown in a frying pan ; serve with fried 
bread, or with poached eggs, as bacon and eggs are served. 

Hash. Take any kind of meat, corned beef is considered 
the best, and chop very fine; measure with a cup, and to 
every cup of chopped meat add one of chopped potato; mix

well together, and season with salt, pepper and a lump of 
butter; put in a frying pan, pour on enough water to moisten 
it; cook for ten or fifteen minutes, stirring often, then set in 
the oven and brown. 

Apples and Rice. Needed: Eight good sized apples, 
3 oz. of butter, the rind of ^ a lemon minced very fine, 6 
oz. of rice, 1% pint of milk, sugar to taste, ^2 teaspoonful 
of grated nutmeg, 6 tablespoonfuls of apricot jam. Peel the 
apples, halve them and take out the cores; put them into a 
stewpan with the butter, and strew sufficient sifted sugar 
over to sweeten them nicely, and add the minced lemon 
peel. Stew the apples very gently until tender, taking care 
they do not break. Boil the rice, with the milk, sugar and 
nutmeg, until soft, and, when thoroughly done, dish it, 
piled high in the center; arrange the apples on it, warm the 
apricot jam, pour it over the whole, and serve hot. 

Apple Fritters. Needed for the batter, % lb. of flour, 
% oz. of butter, % saltspoonful of salt, 2 eggs, milk, apples, 
hot lard or clarified beef dripping. Break the eggs; separate 
the whites from the yolks, and beat them separately. Put the 
flour into a basin, stir in the butter, which should be melted 
to a cream; add the salt, and moisten with sufficient warm 
milk to make it of a proper consistency, that is to say, a 
batter that will drop from the spoon. Stir this well, rub down 
any lumps that may be seen, and add the whites of the eggs, 
which should have been previously well whisked; beat up the 
batter for a few minutes, and it is ready for use. Now peel 
and cut the apples into rather thick whole slices, without 
dividing them, and stamp out the middle of each slice, where 
the core is, with the cutter. Throw the slices into the batter; 
have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; take 
out the pieces of apple one by one, put them into the hot 
lard, and fry a nice brown, turning them when required. 
When done, lay them on a piece of blotting paper before the 



68 Miscellaneous Dishes 

fire, to absorb the greasy moisture; then dish on a white 
d'oyley, piled one above the other; strew over them some 
pounded sugar, and serve very hot. The flavor of the fritters 
would be very much improved by soaking the pieces of apple 
in a little wine, mixed with sugar and lemon juice, for 3 or 
4 hours before wanted for table; the batter, also, is better 
for being mixed some hours before the fritters are made. 

Rissoles. Make a nice puff paste, and roll out thin ; have 
some meat chopped very fine, and sprinkle on half of the 
paste; cover with the other half and press together with the 
rolling pin; cut in squares, or you can use a biscuit cutter, 
and fry in hot lard to a light brown. 

Almond Paste. Needed: One pound of sweet almonds, 
34 lb. of loaf sugar, gelatine flavoring. Blanch the almonds 
by putting them into boiling water; soak them for four 
hours in cold water and pound them well in a mortar, add- 
ing a few drops of water to take off the oiliness. When 
beaten to a paste, put in three-quarters of a pound of well- 
crushed loaf sugar, and mix all together. When quite fine 
and smooth, put it into a stewpan over a slow fire, and stir 
with a wooden spoon till it is white and dry. Put it again 
in the mortar, and mix with it a little melted and strained 
gelatine. Keep it covered. Flavor with what you like. 
Cover with a damp towel, or it will dry up. 

Trout in Jelly (or Other Fish.) This is a beautiful sup- 
per dish, and may be arranged as follows: Turn the fish into 
rings, with tail in mouth, prepare a seasoned water in which 
to boil the trout; the water should have a little vinegar and 
salt in it, and may be flavored with a shalot or clove or 
garlic. When the water is cold, place the. trout in it, and 
boil them very gently, so as not to mash or break them. 
When done, lift out and drain. Baste with fish jelly, for 
which a recipe is given elsewhere, coat after coat, as each 
coat hardens. Arrange neatly, and serve. 




FISH AND MEAT SAUCES 



Chili Sauce. Take twelve ripe tomatoes, one large 
pepper and two onions; chop all very fine, and put in a 
granite or porcelain kettle; add two cups of vinegar, one of 
brown sugar, one tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful

steak. 

Mint Sauce. Heat a teacupful of vinegar boiling hot; 
if put four tablespoonfuls of chopped green mint 
in a bowl, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
pour over them the hot vinegar. This sauce is

together. Heat three cupfuls of white stock; when boiling 
stir in two well beaten eggs; this will form a thin custard; 
last of all add the butter and other ingredients, and boil for 
three minutes, stirring all the time, Serve at once. The 
butter with its seasoning, but without the stock and eggs, is 
used on fried meats and fish instead of butter, and is much 
relished by some. 

Allemande, or White Sauce. Put in a sauce pan a 
cupful of butter, a sliced onion, and a carrot; when the but- 
ter is melted, add a cupful of flour and stir smooth, then 
pour in two quarts of boiling white stock and let it boil

Grate the horseradish, and mix it well with 
the sugar, salt, pepper and mustard; 
moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give it 
the consistency of cream, and serve in a

bain marie, or a jar, which place in a saucepan of boiling 
water; make it hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will 
curdle. 

Note — This sauce is a great improvement on fhe old fashioned way of 
serving cold scraped horseradish with hot roast beef. The mixing of the 
cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything on the plate. 
Of course, with cold meat, the sauce should be served cold. 

Oyster Sauce. Chop a dozen oysters fine and boil in 
their own liquor, skim and then add a pint of white sauce, 
season with salt and pepper, and the juice of a lemon.

A Good Sauce for Steaks. Take one oz. of whole 
black pepper, half oz. of allspice, i oz. of salt, y 2 oz. of 
grated horseradish, x / 2 oz. of pickled shalots, ' i pint of 
mushroom ketchup or walnut pickle. 

Pound all the ingredients finely in a mortar, and put 
them into the ketchup or walnut liquor. Let them stand 
for a fortnight, when strain off the liquor and bottle for use. 
Either pour a little of the sauce over the steaks, or mix it in 
the gravy. 

Mushroom Sauce. Take one can of mushrooms, strain 

off the liquor, cut the mushrooms 

in slices, and put in a sauce pan, 

with a lump of butter aud a large

ance, and should be for use. A small quantity of wine, or 
any liquor, would very much improve the flavor of this 
sauce. It is usually served with bread, rice, custard, or any 
dry pudding that is not very rich. 

Olive Sauce. Use y z lb. of French olives, % pint of 
stock, i teaspoonful of lemon juice. Care- 
fully stone the olives by paring them round 
in ribbons so that they may recover their

pepper and salt. Pick all the meat from the shells and 
shred it finely. Wash and dry the lettuce and cress, and cut 
it up in a bowl, and mix first with the oil, next the pepper 
and salt, and lastly, the vinegar. Stir all well together, 
then add the crab, mixing it well with the salad. Pile on a 
flat dish and garnish with the egg cut in slices and the beet 
root, or tomato. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. Put in a stew-pan a lump of 
butter the size of an egg and when melted, put in a table- 
spoonful of flour; then add a teacupful of milk or water and 
let it come to a boil; have ready three beaten eggs mixed 
with a tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of dry mustard 
and a teacupful of vinegar; salt and pepper to taste; stir in 
with the other ingredients in the sauce-pan, let come to a 
boil and set away to cool.

Salads 85 

two or three minutes longer. This is a nice dressing for 
vegetables.

Tartare Dressing. For tartare sauce take mayonnaise 
dressing and stir into it half a small bottle of capers, or a 
few cucumber pickles chopped fine. 

Summer Salad. Needed: Three lettuces, 2 handfuls 
of mustard and cress, 10 young radishes, a few slices of 
cucumber. Let the herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad. 
Wash and carefully pick them over, and drain them 
thoroughly by swinging them gently in a clean cloth. Cut 
the lettuces into small pieces, and the radishes and cucumbers 
into thin slices; arrange all these ingredients lightly on a 
dish, with the mustard and cress, and pour under, but not 
over, the salad, either of the dressings above, and do not 
stir it up until it is to be eaten. It shou-ld be garnished 
with hard boiled eggs cut in slices, beet root alternately, or 
sliced cucumbers, nasturtiums, and many other things that 
taste will always suggest. In making a good salad, care 
must be taken to have the herbs freshly gathered, and 
thoroughly drained before the sauce is added to them, or it 
will be watery and thin. Young spring onions, cut small, 
are by many persons considered an improvement to salads; 
but before these are added, the cook should always consult 
the taste of her employer. Slices of cold meat or poultry 
added to a salad make a convenient and quickly-made 
summer luncheon dish; or cold fish, flaked, will also be 
found exceedingly nice, mixed with it. 




EGGS 




Boiled Eggs. Have a sauce pan of boiling water; 
drop the eggs in carefully. To 
have the eggs soft, boil three 
minutes; medium, five minutes; 
hard, fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Hard Boiled Eggs. After boil- 
ing fifteen or twenty minutes, take 
out and put in cold water for a few 
Boiled Eggs=. moments. This will cause the 

shells to come off readily. They may be sent to the table 
in the shell, or served with a hot sauce. They are very 
nice cut in halves and served with a mayonnaise dressing. 

Fried Eggs. Having enough fat in a frying-pan to 
nearly cover the eggs when frying, 
break each egg separately in a saucer, 
then slip into the hot fat. Do not 
turn the eggs over, but cook the top by 
basting the hot fat over the eggs. A good plan is to put 
muffin rings in the frying-pan and drop the eggs in, for 
this gives the eggs a nice shape. The rings can be lifted 
out with a fork as soon as the white is partly cooked. 

Deviled Eggs. Boil a dozen eggs for twenty minutes; 
put in cold water and take off the shell. With a sharp knife 
cut in halves lengthwise, take out the yolks carefully, put in

cayenne, a tablespoonful of prepared mustard, and three 
tablespoonsful of melted butter, mix all thoroughly together 
and fill the eggs with the mixture. Put the halves together 
and tie with thread or skewer together with short toothpicks; 
this is for ordinary use. For picnics, or cold spreads, a 
pleasing effect is produced by tying them with narrow 
colored ribbon, or gilt cord. If it is desirable to serve 
them hot, prepare as above, dip in beaten egg, roll in 
cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

Eggs on a Plate. Put a lump of butter the size of an 
egg in a deep earthen plate, put in the oven, and when the 
butter is melted and the plate hot, break in half a dozen 
eggs, season with salt and pepper, and put back in the oven 
until the whites are set. Serve on the plate on which they 
are cooked. 

Poached Eggs. Have enough boiling hot water in a 

^ggM^^k pan to cover the eggs, but do not let it 
boil while putting in the eggs, as it will 
Poached Eggs. render the whites ragged and broken; 
break each egg separately, and slip carefully into the water, 
and when the whites are beginning to set, bring to a boil 
and begin to dip off the water until the tops are bare; boil 
until the whites are firm, take up carefully, put a small 
lump of butter, a little salt, and one shake of pepper on 
each egg, and serve. 

Egg Baskets. Boil eggs for twenty minutes, take off 
the shells, and with a sharp knife cut in two crosswise; take 
out the yolks, rub fine, season with salt, pepper, melted but- 
ter and a little prepared mustard; put this mixture in the 
whites, cut a small slice from the bottom, so they will stand 
upright, arrange on the dish on which they are to be served 
and pour over them hot Old Zealand sauce (see sauces) as 
a dressing. Serve at once. 



88 Eggs 

Scrambled Eggs. Put in a hot frying pan, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of butter; when hot, break in six or eight

eggs are cooked; turn into a dish, season with salt and pep- 
per, and serve hot. 

Scrambled Eggs No. 2. Have the frying pan hot, 
and put in two tablespoonfuls of butter; beat six eggs with 
half a cupful of milk, just enough to mix them, pour Into the 
pan, commence stirring at once, and when done take up in a 
dish and serve at once. 

Eggs with Creamed Beef or Codfish. Just before 
dishing the beef or fish, poach as many eggs as there are 
persons to be served, and place in the dish, pour the creamed 
meat over them and serve. Another way is to drop the eggs 
into the pan with the meat and let them cook until done; 
care must be used not to break the eggs in transferring from 
the pan in which they are cooked to the dish in which they 
are to be served. 

Omelet. Have a smooth frying pan, heat it, and put in 
a tablespoonful of butter; beat six eggs 
until light, and pour into the frying pan. 
Let it cook until almost done through, 
Omelet. then with a knife, double one-half over 

on the other half, and let cook for a moment longer. In 
transferring from the frying pan to the dish on which it is 
to be served, hold the frying pan in the left hand, slip a knife 
under the lower end of the omelet, lift a little, give the pan 
a little shake, and the omelet will be on the dish in good 
shape. An omelet can be equally well cooked by putting 
in the oven and baking instead of frying. 

Oyster Omelet. Proceed as in plain omelet, and just 
before folding over, cover one-half with well drained oysters, 
season with salt and pepper and pour over them a tablespoon-

Mushroom Omelet; Chop half a can of mushrooms 
that have been thoroughly drained, mix with four well beaten 
eggs and proceed as in plain omelet, putting a little more 
butter in the pan than for plain. 

Omelet Soufflee. Needed: Six eggs, 5 oz. of 
pounded sugar, flavoring of vanilla, orange-flower water, or 
lemon rind; 3 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of rice flour. 
Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, add to the 
former the sugar, the rice flour, and either of the above 
flavorings that may be preferred, and stir these ingredients 
well together. Whip the whites of the eggs, mix them lightly 
with the batter, and put the butter into a small frying pan". 
As soon as it begins to bubble, pour the batter into it, and 
set the pan over a bright but gentle fire; and when the 
omelet is set, turn the edges over to make it an oval shape, 
and slip it onto a silver dish, which has been previously 
well buttered. Put it in the oven, and bake from 12 to 15 
minutes; sprinkle only powdered sugar over the souffle, and 
serve it immediately. 

Hum Omelet. Beat the yolks of six eggs with six table- 
spoonfuls of milk; when well beaten add the whites, which 
must be beaten to a stiff froth, mix well together; put a 
lump of butter the size of an egg in the frying pan, and when

tablespoonfuls of apricot, strawberry, or any jam that may 
be preferred. Make the omelet by receipt No. 1 and leave 
flat in the pan. When quite firm, and nicely browned on one 
side, turn it carefully onto a hot dish, spread over the middle 
of it the jam, and fold the omelet over on each side; sprinkle 
sifted sugar over, and serve very quickly. A pretty dish of 
small omelets may be made by dividing the batter into three 
or four portions, and frying them separately ; they should 
then be spread each one with a different kind of preserve, 
and the omelets rolled over. Always sprinkle sweet omelets 
with sifted sugar before being sent to table. 

French Pancakes. Needed: Two eggs, 2 oz. of 
butter, 2 oz.of sifted sugar, 2 oz.of flour, x / 2 pint of new milk. 
Beat the eggs thoroughly and put them into a basin with the

sugar, or pile the pancakes high on a dish, with a layer of 
preserve or marmalade between each. 

Snow Eggs. Needed: Five eggs, one pint of milk, 
pounded sugar to taste, flavoring of vanilla, lemon rind, or 
orange flower water. Put the milk into a sauce pan with 
sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely, and the rind of half a

or until there is no liquid remaining; bring the milk to the 
boiling point, when drop in the snow a tablespoonful at a 
time, and keep turning the eggs until sufficiently cooked. 
Then place them on a glass dish, beat up the yolks of the 
eggs, stir to them the milk, add a little more sugar, and 
strain this mixture into a jug; place the jug in a sauce pan 
of boiling water, and stir it oneway until the mixture thick- 
ens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Pour this 
custard over the eggs, when they should rise to the surface. 
They make an exceedingly pretty addition to a supper, and 
•should be put in a cold place after being made. When they 
are flavored with vanilla or orange flower water, it is not 
necessary to steep the milk. A few drops of the essence of 
either may be poured in the milk just before the whites are 
poached. In making the custard, a little more flavoring and 
sugar should always be added. 

Scotch Eggs. Needed: Six eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of 
forcemeat, No. 629, hot lard, Yz pint of good brown gravy. 
Boil the eggs for 10 minutes; strip them from the shells, and 
cover them with forcemeat. Fry the eggs a nice brown in 
boiling lard, drain them before the fire from their greasy 
moisture, dish them, and pour round them a quarter to half 
a pint of good brown gravy. To enhance the appearance of 
the eggs, they may be rolled in beaten egg and sprinkled 
with bread crumbs; but this is scarcely necessary if they are 
carefully fried. The flavor of ham or anchovy must pre- 
ponderate in the forcemeat, as it should be very relishing. 

Dutch Omelet. Break eight eggs into a basin, season 
with pepper and salt, add two ounces of butter cut small, 
beat these well together; make an ounce of butter hot in a 
frying pan, put the eggs in it, continue to stir it, drawing it 
away from the sides that it may be evenly done, and shake 
it now and then to free it from the pan; when the under side 
is a little browned, turn the omelet into a dish, and serve. 
This must be done over a moderate fire.

Eggs a La Suisse. Spread the bottom of a dish with 
two ounces of fresh butter; cover this with grated cheese, 
and break eight whole eggs upon the cheese without break- 
ing the yolks. Season with red pepper, and salt if necessary ; 
pour a little cream on the surface, strew about two ounces 
of grated cheese on the top, and set the eggs in a moderate 
oven for about a quarter of an hour. Pass a hot salamander 
over the top to brown it. 

Curried Eggs. Slice two onions and fry in butter; add 
a tablespoonful of curry powder, and one pint of good broth 
or stock; stew till onions are quite tender; add a cup of 
cream thickened with arrowroot or rice flour, simmer a few 
moments, then add eight or ten hard boiled eggs cut in 
slices, and beat them well, but do not boil. 

Creamed Eggs. Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make 
one pint of cream sauce. Have six slices of toast on a not 
dish. Put a layer of sauce on each one, and then part of the 
whites of the eggs ; cut in thin strips, and rub part of the yolks 
through a sieve on the toast. Repeat this, and finish with 
a third layer of sauce. Place in the oven for about three 
minutes. Garnish with parsley, and serve.

also be stewed with button onions, or boiled and served with

They must, however, be sent to table very quickly, as, being 
so very small, this vegetable soon cools. Where the cook is 
very expeditious, this vegetable, when cooked, may be ar- 
ranged on the dish in the form of a pineapple ; and so served, 
has a very pretty appearance. 

Stewed Red Cabbage. Needed, 1 red cabbage, a small 
slice of ham, y 2 oz. of fresh butter, 1 pint of weak stock or 
broth, 1 gill of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 1 table- 
spoonful of pounded sugar. Cut the cabbage into very thin 
slices, put it into a stewpan, with the ham cut in dice, the 
butter, half a pint of stock, and the vinegar; cover the pan 
closely, and let it stew for 1 hour. When it is very tender, 
add the remainder of the stock, a seasoning of salt and pepper, 
and the pounded sugar; mix all well together, stir over the 
fire until nearly all the liquor has dried away, and serve. 
Fried sausages are usually sent to table with this dish; they 
should be laid round and on the cabbage, as a garnish. 

Stewed Carrots. Take 7 or 8 large carrots, 1 teacupful

Baked Mushrooms. For this mode of cooking, the 
mushroom flaps are better than the buttons and should not 
be too large. Cut off a portion of stalk, peel the top, and 
put them at once into a tin baking dish, with a very small 
piece of butter placed on each mushroom; sprinkle over a 
little pepper, and let them bake for about twenty minutes.

Have ready a very hot dish, pile the mushrooms high in the 
center, pour the gravy round, and send them to the table 
quickly on very hot plates. 

Baked Spanish Onions. Put the onions, with their 
skins on, into a saucepan of boiling water, slightly salted, 
and let them boil quickly for an hour. Then take them out, 
wipe them thoroughly, wrap each one in a piece of buttered 
paper, and bake them in a moderate oven for two hours, or 
longer, should the onions be very large. They may be 
served in their skins and eaten with a piece of cold butter 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt; or they may be peeled, 
and a good brown gravy poured over them. 

Stewed Cucumbers. Needed, 3 large cucumbers, flour, 
butter, rather more than % pint of good 
brown gravy. Cut the cucumbers length- 
wise the size of the dish they are intended 
to be served in ; empty them of the seeds, 
and put them into boiling water, with a 
^ little salt, and let them simmer for 5 min- 
jUtes'; then take them out, place them in

A German Method of Cooking Potatoes. Needed : 
Eight to ten middling-sized potatoes, .3 oz. of butter, 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour, ^ pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar. Put the butter and flour in a stewpan; stir over 
the fire until the butter is of a nice brown color, and add the 
broth and vinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into long thin 
slices, lay them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently 
until tender, which will be in from 10 to 15 minutes, and 
serve very hot. A laurel leaf simmered with the potatoes is 
an improvement. 




Vegetables 105 

Stewed Spanish Onions. Peel the onions, taking 
care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails, or they 
would then fall to pieces; put them in a stewpan capable of 
holding them at the bottom without piling them one on the 
top of another; add the broth or gravy, and simmer very 
gently until the onions are perfectly tender. Dish them, pour 
the gravy round, and serve. Instead of using broth, Spanish 
onions may be stewed with a large piece of butter; they 
must be done very gradually over a slow fire or hot plate, 
and will produce plenty of gravy. 

Note. — Stewed Spanish onions are a favorite accompaniment to roast 
shoulder of mutton. 

Spinach Dressed with Cream. Needed: Two pail- 
fuls of spinach, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 2 oz. of butter, 8 
tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 small teaspoonful of pounded 
sugar, a very little grated nutmeg. Boil and drain the 
spinach, chop it finely, and put it into a stewpan with the 
butter; stir over a gentle fire, and when the butter has dried 
away, add the remaining ingredients, and simmer for about 
five minutes. Previously to adding the cream, boil it first, 
in case it should curdle. Serve on a hot dish, and garnish 
either with sippets of toasted bread or leaves of puff paste. 

Baked Tomatoes. You need six tomatoes, some bread 
crumbs, a little butter, onion, cayenne and salt. Scoop out 
a small hole at the top; fry the bread crumbs, onion, etc., 
and fill the holes with this as high up as possible; then bake 
the tomatoes in the oven and take care that the skins do 
not break. 

Boiled Vegetable Marrow. Have ready a saucepan 
of boiling water, properly salted, put in the marrows after 
peeling them, and boil them until quite tender. Take them 
up with a slice; halve, and, should they be very large, quar- 
ter them. Dish them on toast, and send to table with a 
tureen of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of 
salt butter. Large vegetable marrows may be preserved 



106 Vegetables 

throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place; when 
wanted for use, a few slices should be cut and boiled in the 
same manner as above ; but when once begun, the marrow 
must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is 
cut. Vegetable marrows are also very delicious, mashed; 
they should be boiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly 
with a wooden spoon. Heat them in a saucepan, add a sea- 
soning of salt and pepper, and a small piece of butter, and 
dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a 
garnish. 

Vegetable marrows are delightful when sliced, and fried 
for ten minutes in butter. Before being fried they may be 
dipped in a batter of flour and water, seasoned with a little 
salt. Vegetable marrow may also be dressed as follows: 
Boil one, and when it is about ready, cut it in pieces, which 
place in a fresh saucepan, covered with soup stock, either 
white or brown; add a little salt in stewing. Serve in a 
deep dish when thoroughly tender. Vegetable marrows are 
very nice plain boiled, and served upon buttered toast. Peel 
them and cut them so as to be able to remove the seeds. 
Marrows will take from twenty minutes to an hour to boil, 
according to size and age. After being parboiled, they may 
be sliced down, dipped in egg, and then rubbed among bread 
crumbs and fried; serve them as hot as possible. 

Butter Beans. With a knife, cut off the ends of pods 
and strings from both sides, being very careful to remove 
every shred; cut every bean lengthwise, in two or three 
strips, and leave them for half an hour in cold water. Much 
more than cover them with boiling water; boil till perfectly 
tender. It is well to allow three hours for boiling. Drain 
well, return to kettle, and add a dressing of half a gill of 
cream, one and a half ounces of butter, one even teaspoon of 
salt, and half a teaspoon of pepper. This is sufficient for a 
quart of cooked beans.

Mashed Squash. Peel, seed and slice fresh summer 
squashes. Lay in cold water ten minutes; put into boiling 
water, a little salt, and cook tender. Twenty minutes will

out all the water; heap in a deep dish, seasoning with pepper, 
salt and butter. Serve hot. 

Baked Squash. Cut in pieces, scrape well, bake from 
one to one and a half hours, according to the thickness of the 
squash; to be eaten with salt and butter as sweet potatoes. 

Fried Squash. Cut the squash into thin slices, and 
sprinkle with salt; let it stand a few moments; then beat two 
eggs, and dip the squash into the egg; then fry it brown in 
butter. 

Pilaff. Two cups of water, one cup of rice. Put on the 
water with a little salt, and add the juice of one or two 
tomatoes to the water, or sufficient to color it. When the 
water boils, put in the rice, and boil until all the water is 
soaked up. Then add melted butter to taste, stir, cover and 
keep in a warm place, but not on the fire, till dinner is 
served. 

To Preserve Vegetables for Winter Use. Green 
string beans must be picked when young; put a layer three 
inches deep in a small wooden keg or barrel; sprinkle in 
salt an inch deep, then put another layer of beans, then salt, 
and beans and salt in alternate layers, until you have enough ; 
let the last be salt; cover them with a piece of board which 
will fit the inside of the barrel or keg, and place a heavy 
weight upon it; they will make brine. 

When wanted for use, soak them one night or more, in 
plenty of water, changing it once or twice, until the salt is 
out of them ; then cut them, and boil the same as when 
fresh. 

Carrots, beans, beetroots, parsnips and potatoes keep best

in dry sand or earth in a cellar; turnips keep best on a 
cellar bottom, or they may be kept the same as carrots, etc. 
Whatever earth remains about them when taken from the 
ground, should not be taken off. 

When sprouts come on potatoes or other vegetables, they 
should be carefully cut off. The young sprouts from turnips 
are sometimes served as a salad, or boiled tender in salt and 
water, and served with butter and pepper over. 

Celery may be kept all winter by setting it in boxes filled 
with earth; keep it in the cellar; it will grow and whiten in 
the dark. Leeks may also be kept in this way. 

Cabbage set out in earth, in a good cellar, will keep good 
and fresh all winter. Small close heads of cabbage may be 
kept many weeks by taking them before the frost comes, 
and laying them on a stone floor; this will whiten them, and 
make them tender. 

Store onions are to be strung, and hung in a dry, cold 
place.

CAKE 



Rich Bride or Christening Cake. Needed, 5 lbs. 
of the finest flour, 3 lbs. of fresh butter, 5 lbs. of currants, 2 
lbs. of sifted loaf sugar, 2 nutmegs, ^ oz. of mace, % oz. of 
cloves, 16 eggs, 1 lb. of sweet almonds, % lb. of candied 
citron, y 2 lb. each of candied orange and lemon peel, 1 gill 
of wine, 1 gill of brandy. Let the flour be as fine as possible, 
and well dried and sifted; the currants washed, picked and 
dried before the fire; the sugar well pounded and sifted; the 
nutmegs grated; the spices pounded; the eggs thoroughly 

whisked, whites and yolks 
separately; the almonds 
pounded with a little 
orange-flower water; and 
the candied peel cut in 
neat slices. When all 
these ingredients are pre- 
pared, mix them in the 
following manner : Begin 
working the butter with 
the hand till it becomes 
of a cream-like con- 
sistency; stir in the 
sugar, and when the 
whites of the eggs are 
whisked to a solid froth, 
mix them with the butter 
and sugar; next, well 
beat up the yolks for 10 
minutes, and adding them 
to the flour, nutmegs, mace and cloves, continue beating the 
whole toge'ther for half an hour or longer, till wanted for

the oven. Then mix in lightly the currants, almonds and 
candied peel, with the wine and brandy; and having lined 
a hoop with buttered paper, fill it with the mixture, and bake 
the cake in a tolerably quick oven, taking care, however, 
not to burn it; to prevent this, the top of it may be covered 
with a sheet of paper. To ascertain whether the cake is 
done, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it, withdraw 
it directly, and if the blade is not sticky and looks bright, 
the cake is sufficiently baked. These cakes are usually 
spread with a thick layer of almond icing, and over that 
another layer of sugar icing, and afterward ornamented. 
In baking a large cake like this, great attention must be 
paid to the heat of the oven; it should not be too fierce, but 
have moderate heat to bake the cake through.

sugar to a cream, then stir in the milk, lard, jelly and spices, 
then stir in the fruit (the raisins must be stoned and cut in 
two, the currants picked, washed and dried, and the citron 
shaved fine), then the soda dissolved in a little water, next

Creams and Custards 141 

cold water, pour in the blanc mange and when firm turn out 
and serve with cream and sugar. 

Chocolate Blanc Mange No. 2. Put two quarts of 
milk in a double boiler and let come to a boil; grate one- 
half cake of Baker's chocolate and boil for one hour. Take 
one box of Cox's gelatine, dissolve and add to the milk, 
sweeten with two cups of sugar, flavor with vanilla, strain 
and put into a mould. 

Charlotte Russe. Put two cupfuls of milk into a sauce 
pan, and let come to a boil. Take the yolks of four eggs, 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, beat together, stir into the boil- 
ing milk, and when thickened set the custard away to cool. 
Take one-half of a box of gelatine, and add to it one cupful 
of warm water, and set it on the back of the stove, but do 
not let it get hot. Beat the whites of five eggs to a stiff 
froth, add one and one-half cupfuls of pulverized sugar. 
Whip two cupfuls of cream, and add it to the custard; add 
flavoring to the beaten whites of the eggs and mix them 
with the custard, and last of all add the gelatine, and stir in 
thoroughly; take the dish in which the Charlotte russe is to 
be served, line with white sponge cake or lady fingers, pour 
the custard into it and set into the ice chest. This should 
be made two or three hours before serving. 

Spanish Cream. Dissolve one-half of a box of gelatine 
in a little warm water. Put one and one-half pints of milk 
in a double boiler, beat the yolks of three eggs with two- 
thirds of a cup of sugar, add to the milk and boil for a few 
minutes, then add the gelatine. Take from the fire and stir 
in the beaten whites of four eggs, and put into a mould, and 
when cold serve with whipped cream. 

Russian Cream. Jelly: To one package of gelatine 
add one pint of cold water, when dissolved add one pint of 
hot water, two cups of sugar, and the juice of six lemons; 
stir slowly until well dissolved, then strain into moulds. 



I4 2 Creams and Custards 

Cream: Cover one package of gelatine with cold water, 
when dissolved add one cup of new milk, one cup of sugar, 
heat to boiling point, stirring frequently. Then set away to 
cool. Whip one quart of thick cream until light, beat the 
whites of six eggs and add both to the mixture. When cool 
flavor with vanilla. Place the jelly in the bottom of the 
moulds, and when stiff and cold add the cream; turn out of 
the moulds and serve in slices. 

Whipped Cream. Needed: To every pint of cream 
allow 3 oz. of pounded sugar, i glass of sherry, or any kind 
of sweet white wine, the rind of y 2 a lemon, the white of i 
egg. Rub the sugar on the lemon rind and pound it in a 
mortar until quite fine, and beat up the white of the egg 
until quite stiff; put the cream in a large bowl, with the 
sugar, wine, and beaten egg, and whip it to a froth; as fast 
as the froth rises, take it off with a skimmer, and put it on a 
sieve to drain, in a cool place. This should be made the 
day before it is wanted, as the whip is then so much firmer. 
The cream should be whipped in a cool place, and in sum- 
mer, over ice, if it is obtainable. A plain whipped cream 
may be served on a glass dish, and garnished with strips of 
angelica, or pastry leaves, or pieces of bright colored jelly; 
it makes a very pretty addition to the supper table. 

Stewed Apples and Custard. You need seven 
good sized -apples, the rind of j4 a 
lemon or 4 cloves; y lb. of sugar, y 
stewed Apples. P int o( water, y 2 pint of custard. 

Pare and take out the cores of the apples, without dividing 
them, and, if possible, leave the stalks on; boil the sugar 
and water together for 10 minutes; then put in the apples 
with the lemon rind or cloves, whichever flavor may be pre- 
ferred, and simmer gently until they are tender, taking care 
not to let them break. Dish them neatly on a glass dish, 




Creams and Custards 143 

reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly for a few minutes, let 
it cool a little; then pour it over the apples. Have ready 
quite half a pint of custard; pour it round, but not over, the 
apples when they are quite cold, and the dish is ready for 
table. A few almonds, blanched and cut into strips, and 
stuck in the apples, would improve their appearance. 

Stewed Pears. Take six or eight pears, water, sugar, 
two ounces of butter, the yolk of an egg, one-half ounce of 
gelatine. Peel and cut the pears in any form that may be 
preferred, and steep them in cold 
water to prevent their turning black; 
put them into a saucepan with suffi- 
stewed Pears. " cient cold water to cover them, and 
boil them, with the butter and enough sugar to sweeten 
them nicely, until tender; then brush the pears over with 
the yolk of an egg, sprinkle them with sifted sugar, and 
arrange them on a dish. Add the gelatine to the syrup, 
simmer it quickly for about five minutes, strain it over the 
pears, and let it remain until set. The syrup may be 
colored with a little prepared cochineal, which would very 
much improve the appearance of the dish. 

Preserved Quinces. Pare and quarter the fruit; boil 
in enough water to keep them whole; 
when they are tender take them out, and 
to each pound of quinces add one pound 
of white sugar; let them stand with the 
sugar on until the next day, when the 
syrup will be as light and clear as 
amber; put them in the pan and let them 
boil twenty minutes; they never get hard. " The Quince. 
The water they were boiled in may be used to make a jelly 
of the parings; add one pound of white sugar to each pint of 
juice, and boil half an hour. 

Jelly with Oranges. Take one quart of any clear 




144 Creams and Custards 

_^j^ yellow jelly, six oranges, a little syrup, 

zg^^l^^^, preserved cherries, angelica. Peel the 

lllii iii BP oranges and divide them into quarters, 
^^^H^Bsfe taking off all the white; coat a plain 
compote of oranges. mou id w i t h the jelly, then lay in the 
oranges, each piece dipped in clear syrup, in the manner 
shown in the illustration, putting the angelica, cut into 
leaves, in the corners of the mould, and the cherries round 
the top and bottom, and between the pieces of orange; fill up 
with jelly, and set on ice. 

Orange Custards. Needed: The juice of ten large 
oranges, a teacupful of sifted sugar, the yolks of twelve 
eggs, one pint of cream. Sweeten the orange juice with 
the sugar, and set it over the fire; stir constantly till hot, 
when skim it carefully, and set aside to cool. When nearly 
cold add the yolks of eggs beaten very light, and the 
cream. Put all into a saucepan, and stir over a very slow 
fire until thick. Pour into cups, and serve cold. If desired, 
the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff, with a teacupful of 
pounded sugar, may be used, a heaped tablespoonful on the 
top of each cup of the custard. 

Rice Snowballs. Needed: Six ounces of rice, one 
quart of milk, flavoring of essence of almonds, sugar to 
taste, one pint of custard. Boil the rice in the milk, with 
sugar and a flavoring of essence of almonds, until the former 
is tender, adding, if necessary, a little more milk, should it 
dry away too much. When the rice is quite soft, put it into 
teacups, ox small round jars, and let it remain until cold; 
then turn out the rice on a deep glass dish, pour over a 
custard, and on the top of each ball, place a small piece of 
bright colored preserve or jelly. Lemon peel or vanilla 
may be boiled with rice instead of the essence of almonds, 
when either of these is preferred; but the flavoring of the 
custard must correspond with that of the rice.

PASTRY 

General Instructions 

In pastry making, the quality to be desired is lightness, 
and this depends on the amount of air in the pastry before 
and the expansion of the air after it is put in the oven. 
Therefore the best pastry is that which contains the greatest 
quantity of the coldest air before it is baked. The foldings 
and the rollings, with which we are all familiar, has this 
increase of air in view. The difference between flaky and 
short crust is that in one there are thin layers of air and 
pastry alternating, and in the other the air fills small cavi- 
ties all over the pastry. 

To make the air cold, pastry should always be made in a 
cold place, with cold water, on ice if possible, and paste that 
is set aside to wait between rollings or before baking should 
stand on ice or on a cold stone. Cooks with a hot hand 
should mix paste with a knife. Pastry should be rolled 
lightly, the rolling pin often lifted and little pressed upon. 
It should not be turned over or thrown about. Any pieces 
that are left over should be laid on over the other and rolled 
flat, not rolled into a ball as the common practice is. Eggs 
are used to increase the tenacity of the paste, and so hold 
more air, or if, as sometimes happens, the white is whisked 
to a froth, it contains a great deal of air which it carries 
with it into the paste. Baking powder has the same effect 
in pastry and in bread, where its action has been more or less 

154 



Short Cakes 155 

fully described. If it is used, it should be for pastry baked 
at once and little handled — that is for short rather than for 
flaky crust. 

SHORT CAKES 

Crust No. 1. Take one quart of flour, and add to it two 
teaspoonfuls of soda and two of cream tartar, sift two or 
three times, and rub into it a lump of butter the size of an 
egg', add a pint of sour milk, and work smooth with as little 
kneading as possible; roll out to half an inch in thickness, 
place in a shallow square baking pan and bake in a brisk 
oven for twenty minutes. When done, split open, butter, and 
put fruit between the layers and on top. Another nice way 
is to make the crust as above, and divide in two equal parts; 
roll out one-half to fit the baking tin, and spread with but- 
ter, then roll out the other half and put on top of the first 
half, then spread a little butter on top of the last half. This 
will make the crust nice and flaky, and also cause it to come 
apart without splitting with a knife. 

Crust No. 2. Beat together one egg, one-half cupful of 
sugar, a lump of butter the size of an egg, two cupfuls of 
sweet milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and flour 
enough to make a batter as for cake; bake in layers in a 
quick oven for almost twenty minutes. 

Fruit for Short Cake. Strawberries, raspberries, black- 
berries, very ripe peaches and oranges make a nice filling 
for short cake. The fruit should be mashed or sliced, sweet- 
ened and put between the crust, and on top. Jam, mar- 
malade, and almost any kind of preserved fruit can be used, 
if fresh fruit is not obtainable. 

Roll Puddings. Make a crust as for short cake, roll 
out thin, and spread with raspberries, peaches, chopped 
apples, or any fruit that is suitable; sweeten the fruit and 



156 Pies 

roll over and over, pinch the ends and side opening together, 
and either boil or bake. Two hours will be required to boil 
it, while one and one-half hours will be sufficient for baking. 
Serve with sauce. 

PIES 

Pie Crust. Take one quart of flour and rub into it a 
cupful of butter or lard, add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
enough very cold water to make a stiff dough. Mix with as 
little handling as possible, and put on ice or in a cool place, 
an hour or two before using; roll out thin, put in the fill- 
ing, and spread a little butter on the upper crust, before 
baking. , 

Puff Paste. Take one pound of flour, and one pound of 
butter. Rub the flour and one-half the butter together, and 
add enough cold water to make a stiff dough, roll this out 
till one-half inch in thickness, then put on one-half of the 
remainder of the butter in a lump; fold the corners of the 
dough over the butter, and roll out carefully until about a 
quarter of an inch thick, put on the rest of the butter, fold 
the corners over this again, and roll out again in as long 
a strip as possible, fold backward and forward, and roll 
out as before. Do this four or five times, letting rest one- 
half hour between each rolling. 

Tart Paste. Take one-half cupful of water, one-half 
cupful of lard, the beaten white of one egg, three tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, and one teaspoonful of cream tartar, 
and one-half teaspoonful of soda; add flour enough to make 
a. moderately stiff dough. 

Fruit Pies. Rub the plates or tins on which they are 
to be baked with a very little butter; roll the crust out thin, 
line the plate, and put in the fruit, being careful not to put 
in too much, as that would cause the pie to run over. 
Sweeten to taste, and if the fruit is juicy, stir a little flour

gooseberries, rhubarb, plums, etc., do not need any season- 
ing, except sugar. Apple and peach pies are improved by 
placing bits of butter on the fruit before putting on the 
upper crust. The edge of under crust should be wet with a. 
little flour and water before putting on the upper crust. Pies 
should be baked in a moderate oven, the usual time being 
from forty to sixty minutes.

Cucumber Pickles. Take two hundred cucumbers 
rather under medium size; wash and put in a stone jar. Put 
in a porcelain or granite kettle, two gallons of good cider 
vinegar, one cupful of salt, eight ounces of horseradish, 
two ounces of altim, one ounce of mustard, one ounce of 
allspice, and one ounce of cloves; heat all together boiling 
hot, and pour over with green horseradish or cabbage leaves. 
In a week's time drain off the vinegar, scald, and put back 
qn the pickles, then cover with a flannel cloth. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles. Pare and cut the cucumbers, 
and scrape out the seeds. Put the pieces in a stone jar, and 
cover with salt and water, not too strong; let stand for a day 
or two, changing the water once or twice; takeout, and 
drain; then let stand in fresh water for a few hours; then 
boil them in vinegar until tender; skim out carefully, and 
put in a stone jar. Make a syrup of one quart of vinegar, 
four pounds of sugar, one ounce of cassia buds, and a table- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon ; boil until the syrup is clear, and 
pour over the cucumbers. This amount of syrup is enough 
for three quarts of the cucumbers after they are boiled. 

Chow Chow. Chop one peck of green tomatoes fine. 
Sprinkle a large cupful of salt over them, and let stand over 

162

night. In the morning put in a sieve and drain; then take 
six large green peppers, six large onions, six or eight stalks 
of celery, and chop all fine, and put in a porcelain kettle 
with the chopped tomato; put in with them two teaspoonfuls 
each of ground mustard, cinnamon and cloves; add a half 
teaspoonful of mace, two pounds of brown sugar, and enough 
vinegar to cover all. Simmer for two hours, stirring oc- 
casionally. Put up in glass or stone jars. 

Sweet Chow-Chow. One gallon cabbage, two quarts 
green tomatoes, one pint of onions, one-fourth cup green 
peppers; chop all fine and add one and one-half pounds of 
sugar, one tablespoon mustard, one tablespoon ginger, two 
tablespoons cloves, two tablespoons salt, three tablespoons 
cinnamon, or three or four sticks cinnamon. Put all in 
three quarts vinegar and boil until cabbage is tender. 

Mustard Pickles. Take two quarts small green cu- 
cumbers, two quarts of small green tomatoes, cut in halves 
or quarters; one quart of very small onions, two quarts of 
cauliflower, cut in small pieces. Let them stand over night 
in a weak brine, and in the morning cook each. separately 
until tender. Put all together in a stone jar, and pour over 
them a mixture made as follows: Put on the fire one gallon 
of good cider vinegar, and let come to a boil; mix together 
one large cupful of flour, one pound of ground mustard, and 
three cupfuls of sugar; stir into the boiling vinegar, let it 
cook for two or three minutes; then pour the vegetables in 
the jar. These pickles will keep for a year. 

Green Tomato Pickles. Slice one-half bushel of 
green tomatoes as thin as possible, and let stand in strong 
salt and water for twenty-four hours; takeout carefully, and 
put in fresh cold water, and let stand for twelve hours; take 
out and drain; put on more cold water, and let stand for 
twelve hours longer; take out and drain, and boil in fresh 
water until it is tender enough to cut easily with a fork or 



164 Pickles and Preserves 

spoon; take out carefully, and drain once more. Make a 
syrup of one-half gallon of vinegar, eight pounds of nice 
brown sugar, one-half tablespoonful of every kind of spice, 
one tablespoonful of whole mustard seed. Let all boil to- 
gether for ten minutes; then put in the tomatoes about a 
quart at a time, and boil for fifteen minutes; skim out care- 
fully, and put in a stone jar; put more tomatoes in the 
vinegar, and proceed as before until all are cooked; then 
boil clown the syrup a few minutes, and pour over the to- 
matoes. These pickles are delicious, and will keep for 
months. 

Ripe Tomato Pickles. Weigh off seven pounds of 
nice, firm, medium sized tomatoes; take off the skins by 
scalding; stick six or eight whole cloves in each one, and 
place in a jar. Put two quarts of good cider vinegar in a 
preserving kettle, add five pounds of nice brown sugar, 
a few sticks of cinnamon, and a tablespoonful of bruised 
ginger root; let all boil together for fifteen minutes; then 
pour boiling hot over the tomatoes; cover with a plate, and 
put a weight on to keep the fruit under the vinegar. 

Tomato Preserves. Cut six lemons in slices, and boil 
until tender in three pints of water; then skim out, and put 
in ten pounds of sugar, and let it boil until the sugar is all 
dissolved; then put in ten pounds of peeled and sliced to- 
matoes, and boil for one-half hour; put back the lemons, 
and boil for ten or fifteen minutes longer. Put in jars, and 
cover closely. Partly ripe tomatoes are better than ripe 
ones for these preserves. A little ginger root boiled with 
the lemons improves the flavor. 

Sliced Green Tomato Pickle. One-half peck green 
tomatoes (unpeeled), one pint sugar, one and one-half pints 
vinegar, one tablespoon cinnamon; one tablespoon whole 
allspice, handful whole cloves, little nutmeg and dry mus-

Pickles and Preserves 165 

Tomato Chutney. Cut up and peel twelve large 
tomatoes, six onions chopped fine, one cup vinegar, one cup 
sugar, handful of raisins, chopped fine, salt to taste, one-half 
teaspoon of cayenne, one-half teaspoon white pepper. Boil 
one hour and a half, bottle or put in stone jar. 

Spiced Tomatoes. Put in a porcelain kettle one pint 
of good cider vinegar, four pounds of sugar, one-half ounce 
of cloves, and one ounce of cinnamon in a thin muslin bag 
and let boil until clear, then put seven pounds of whole 
tomatoes (peeled) and boil for two hours. Put in a stone 
jar. It will keep for months. 

Tomato Catsup. Scald and peel ripe tomatoes, cook 
until soft, and press through a sieve. To one gallon of the 
tomato add one pint of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
two tablespoonfuls of mustard, one of allspice, one of 
cinnamon, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one of ground 
cloves, and one red pepper pod without seeds. Simmer an 
hour or more, put in jugs and cork tight. 

Chili Sauce. Five large onions, eight green peppers, 
thirty ripe tomatoes, all chopped fine; add to them five 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of salt, and eight cupfuls of 
vinegar; mix all together, and boil two and one-half hours. 
Put in glass jars. 

Pickled Lily. Chop very fine one peck of green tomatoes, 
two small heads of cabbage, three green peppers, four onions, 
six large cucumbers; put all in a large stone jar, and sprinkle 
over it a teacupful of salt and let stand over night. In the

sieve. Make a syrup of three quarts of vinegar and four 
pounds of sugar, and let all boil together for thirty minutes. 
Put up in glass or stone jars. 

Pickled Nasturtiums. (A very Good Substitute for 
Capers.) Use to each pint of vinegar, one ounce of salt, 



1 6.6 



Pickles and Preserves 



six peppercorns, nasturtiums. Gather the nasturtium pods on 
a dry day, and wipe them clean with a cloth; put them in a 
dry glass bottle, with vinegar, salt and pepper, in the 
above proportions. If you cannot find enough ripe to 
fill a bottle, cork up what you have got until you have 
some more fit; they may be added from day to day. Bung 
up the bottles, and seal or rosin the tops. They will be fit 
for use in ten or twelve months; and the best way is to make 
them one season for the next. 

Pickled Gherkins. Let the gherkins remain in salt 
and water for three or four days, when 
take them out, wipe perfectly dry, and 
put them into a stone jar. Boil sufficient 
vinegar to cover them, with spices and 
pepper, etc., in the above proportion, 
for ten minutes; pour it, quite boiling, 
over the gherkins, cover the jar with 
vine leaves, and put over them a plate, 
setting them near the fire, where they 
must remain all night. Next day drain 
off the vinegar, boil it up again, and 
pour it hot over them. Cover up with fresh leaves, and let 
the whole remain till quite cold. Now tie down closely with 
bladder to exclude the air, and in a month or two they will 
be fit for use. 

Citron or Melon Preserves. Take thick watermelon 
or citron rind, and cut in strips about three inches long, 
and one-half inch thick, until you have five pounds, and let 
them stand in cold water for two or three hours. Make a 
syrup of five pounds of best white sugar, and two quarts of 
water, and squeeze in the juice of six lemons, and add the 
grated rind of three; let boil for fifteen minutes, then strain; 
heat again and stir in the beaten white of an egg, and skim 
off as it rises; the syrup should be of a nice lemon color,

and as clear as amber; put in the citron, which should be 
drained and dry, and cook until tender. Skim out the fruit 
carefully, and add to the syrup a pound of best raisins, boil 
for two or three minutes, and pour over the fruit. Great 
care must be taken to remove every particle of stem from the 
raisins and to wash them thoroughly, so that there will be 
no dark specks in the clear syrup. 

Walnut Ketchup. Use one-half a sieve of walnut 
shells, two quarts of water, salt, one-half 
pound of shalots, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of mace, one ounce of whole 
pepper, one ounce of garlic. Put the 
walnut shells into a pan, with the water 
and a large quantity of salt; let them 
stand for ten days, then break the shells 
up in the water, and let it drain through 
a sieve, putting a heavy weight on the 
top to express the juice; place it on the fire, and remove all 
scum that may arise. Now boil the liquor with the shalots, 
cloves, mace, pepper and garlic, and let all simmer till the 
shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan, and, when cold, 
bottle, and cork closely. It should stand six months before 
using; should it ferment during that time, it must be again 
boiled and skimmed. 

Blackberry Pickle. Seven pounds of fruit, five pounds 
white sugar, one pint of best cider vinegar, and cook until 
the berries are done. Skim out the berries, boil the juice 
until thick as good syrup, pour over berries, cover and keep 
in cool, not cold, place. These will keep a long time, and 
need not be sealed up, as they will keep without. Raspberry 
jam will keep, too, if cooked thoroughly in common earthen 
jars, simply covering to keep free from dust. 

Pineapple Preserves. Have your pineapples as ripe 
as they can be procured; pare and cut in thin slices and cut 
each slice in quarters; be very careful to remove every par 



1 68 Pickles and Preserves 

tide of the skin, for if all is not removed it will cause the 
preserves to look specky. Weigh the fruit and allow a 
pound of sugar for every pound of fruit. Put a layer of the 
pineapple in a large earthen dish, then a layer of sugar, and 
so on until all the fruit is in the dish; put a layer of sugar 
on top, and let stand over night. In the morning drain off 
the juice and put in a preserving kettle; stir in the beaten 
white of an egg and skim as it comes to a boil. Let it boil 
for ten minutes, then pour boiling hot over the pineapple, 
and let it stand and grow cold with covering. When 
thoroughly cold put in glass jars and seal. 

Brandied Peaches. Take a peck of nice peaches not 
' too ripe and take off the skins by scald- 
ing with hot water. Weigh the fruit 
and allow a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Make a syrup of the 
sugar, allowing two-thirds of a cupful 
of water to each pound of sugar. Let 
the syrup come to a boil, skim and 
when clear put in the fruit and let them cook until they can 
be pierced with a straw ; then take out one at a time, and 
place carefully in a jar. Let the syrup boil a few minutes, 
then put in two quarts of brandy and boil for a few minutes 
longer, then pour over the peaches. Put up in glass jars, if 
preferred. 

Preserved Fruit. In preserving, those fruits that are 
naturally sweet, require only three-fourths of a pound of 
sugar to one of fruit, while those fruits that are very acid 
require pound for pound. Small fruits are boiled down 
with the syrup until the syrup is thick and clear, then taken 
from the fire and put in jars; while the larger fruits, such as 
pears, quinces, plums, and peaches, are boiled in the syrup 
until they look clear and are tender, then skimmed out care- 
fully and put in a jar. Allow the juice to boil until thick, 





a preserving 



Pickles and Preserves 169 

then pour over the fruit. Cover with paper wet in brandy. 

Pickled Apples. Peel, quarter, and core nice sweet 
apples until you have five pounds; put them 
in a stewpan, cover with water, and cook 
until tender; lift out carefully with a skim- 
mer and put on an earthen dish. Make a 
syrup of three pounds of sugar, and one pint 
of vinegar, add some stick cinnamon, and a 
few cloves; boil until clear, then put in the 
apples and cook slowly for twenty or thirty 
minutes, put in glass cans. 

Plum Catsup. Put in 

kettle six pounds of plums, 
three and one-half pounds of sugar, and one 
quart vinegar; boil until the plums are re- 
duced to a pulp; cool and press through a 
sieve, then add cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg 
and allspice to taste. Put up in glass jelly 
cups. 

Grape Catsup. 

Five pounds of grapes, boiled to 
a pulp and sifted, add two pounds 
of sugar, one pint of vinegar, one 
tablespoonful each of cinnamon, 
cloves, allspice,andone teaspoon- 
r* ful of pepper. Boil two hours 
and put up in glass. 

Canned Fruit. In canning fruit be sure to have it good 
and fresh. If at all decayed or fermented, it will cause the 
fruit to work after it is canned. Allow one cupful of sugar 
to a quart can of peaches, pears, cherries and raspberries, 
and two cupfuls to strawberries, grapes, gooseberries and 
fruit that is very tart. Make a syrup of the sugar and some 
water, and let it boil before putting in the fruit. The more 





170 Pickles and Preserves 

juicy the fruit is, the less water will be required. Boil the 
fruit until cooked through, but not long enough to become 
mussy; have your can full of hot water, and when ready to 
fill with fruit, pour out the water and set it in a basin partly 
filled with hot water, put in the fruit with a fruit tunnel, and 
when filled wipe off the can with a damp cloth, put on the 
rubber and top hot and screw down ; tip the can bottom side 
up and if no juice escapes it is airtight, but if there is a 
flow of juice press down the lower edge of the cover with an 
iron spoon handle; if this is not effectual add another rub- 
ber, or change the cover. In canning strawberries plunge 
them in the hot syrup and boil briskly at least thirty or forty 
minutes; this will prevent them from losing their shape and 
color after they are canned. Pears should be put in cold 
water as soon as peeled, to prevent discoloration. 

Fruit Jellies. Boil the fruit with as little water as 
possible, and squeeze in a jelly bag. 
Allow a pound of sugar to a pint of 
juice, and boil until it jellies, which 
is usually in fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Pour in cans or glasses, and leave un- 
covered until cold. If the jelly fails to thicken as much as 
is desirable when cold, set the glasses in the sun for two 
or three days, leaving off the covers. 

Jams. Crush the fruit with a potato masher, and al- 
low a pound of sugar to a pint of the 
crushed fruit. Bring to a boil slowly to 
prevent scorching, and boil until thick and 
clear. Put up in glass. 

Orange Marmalade. Take two dozen 
sour oranges, and take off the peel, cut in halves across the 
sections, take out the seeds, and weigh. Take as many 
pounds of sugar as you have pounds of fruit, and put in a 
preserving kettle with enough water to dissolve. Bring to a 





Pickles and Preserves 171 

boil slowly, to prevent scorching, and boil for ten or fifteen 
minutes. While the syrup is boiling, grate half a cupful of 
the yellow part of the orange peel, and when the syrup has 
boiled the requisite time, put in the orange and grated peel. 
Boil fifteen minutes longer, and put in glass jars or cups. 

Syrup for Spiced Fruit. One pint of vinegar, three 
and one-half pounds of sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, 
tied in a thin muslin bag and boiled in the syrup. Pears, 
peaches, cherries, plums, grapes, can all be spiced or pickled 
in this syrup; it always gives satisfaction. Allow about 
seven pounds of fruit to the above rule. 

Apple Marmalade. Take green fruit, sour, equal 
quantities of apples and sugar, cook the apples (a peck be- 
fore they are cored) with a little water, and two lemons. 
When thoroughly cooked then sift, add sugar, boil fifteen 
minutes, and can. Much better than the ripe fruit, and it 
looks clearer. Common sour apples that are juicy, or crab 
apples, are the best for this. 

Canning. The proportions of sugar fruit used in canning 
and preserving vary greatly. The amount of sugar given 
below is about an average for canning when a very rich 
preserve is not desired. These canned fruits are excellent 
for pies, etc.

CANDY 

Cream Candy. Take one pound of white sugar, one 
cupful of water, one-half teaspoonful of cream tartar, two 
teaspoonfuls of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla, butter 
the size of an egg; boil until it hardens when dropped into 
water. Pour upon a buttered platter and when nearly cold, 
pull. 

Sugar Candy. Take two cupfuls of " A " coffee sugar, 
one-third cupful of good vinegar, two-thirds of a cupful of 
water; boil without stirring until it crisps in cold water. 
Turn out upon a buttered platter and pour the desired flavor 
over it. When sufficiently cool pull until white and light, 
pulling directly from you without twisting. Have the hands 
clean and dry; do not use butter on them. This rule is 
varied by using different flavorings, and makes excellent 
candy by pouring it over nuts or popcorn. 

French Creams. Take two cupfuls of granulated 
sugar, add to it one-half a cupful of milk, set upon the stove 
and bring slowly to a boil and boil for five minutes; take off 
the fire and set in a pan of cold water, stir rapidly until it 
creams. Shape into balls with the hands and nuts on top of 
some of the creams. ; or it can be arranged in layers and figs 
or dates placed between; then cut in squares. Fine 
chocolate creams can be made of this mixture by dipping 
the balls into melted chocolate, leaving until cold upon but- 
tered white paper. 

French Creams No. 2. Break the white of an egg 
into a glass and add an equal quantity of milk or water; 
then stir in enough XXXX confectioners' sugar to make 
sufficiently stiff to roll into shape; about a pound and a half 
will be needed; use different flavorings to make a variety.

Candy I J^ 

Chocolate Caramels. One cupful of grated chocolate, 
one cupful of brown sugar, one cupful of molasses, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk; boil until it hardens when dropped 
in water. Then add a piece of butter the size of an egg, 
and one cupful of chopped English walnut meats; pour into 
a buttered pan, and when partly cold cut in squares. 

Kisses. Two cupfuls of powdered sugar, the whites of 
three eggs, two cupfuls of cocoanut, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder; mix all together, drop upon buttered paper, 
and bake until slightly brown in a brisk oven. 

Crystalized Popcorn. Put into an iron kettle one 
tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of water and 
one teacupful of white sugar; boil until ready to candy, 
then throw in three quarts of nicely popped corn, stir 
briskly until the candy is evenly distributed over the corn. 
Care should be taken not to have too hot a fire, or the corn 
will be scorched while crystalizing. Nuts of any kind may 
be treated in the same way. 

Molasses Candy. Take four cupfuls of sugar, two 
cupfuls of molasses and one-half cupful of vinegar; boil 
until it crisps in cold water, then stir in one tablespoonful 
of baking soda. Pour into well buttered dishes, leave until 
sufficiently cool, then pull. 

Nougat. Almonds and other nuts for nougat should be 
blanched, drained and skinned some time before they are 
chopped. The nougat is made by melting pounded sugar in 
a copper sugar boiler, putting a dessertspoonful of lemon 
juice to each pound, then adding double the weight of 
sugar in almonds, either colored or white, filberts, or 
pistachios, and a little sweet liquor. The almonds or nuts 
should be hot when put into the syrup. For lining moulds, 
small pieces of the nougat should be pressed in with a lemon 
till the mould is covered, when the nougat should be turned 
out. 




BEVERAGES 

Coffee. In preparing tea and coffee, it is of the first 
importance to begin right. See that the teakettle is clean, 
and the water pure. A teakettle that is filled with lime, or 
other sediment, is unfit for use, and water that has stood in 
the house over night, or for some hours, is impure. To be- 
gin then, rinse the teakettle thoroughly and fill with fresh 
water, put on the fire, and bring to a boil quickly. For 
coffee, procure of a good reliable dealer a mixture of one- 
third Mocha, to two-thirds Java, freshly roasted and ground. 
Allow a tablespoonful of ground coffee for every person to 
be served, and put in an extra spoonful for every five or six 
persons. If an ordinary pot is used, mix the coffee with an 
egg, put it in the coffee pot and add to it about a cupful of 
cold water; set it on the stove and bring to a boil quickly. 
The moment it begins to boil, add boiling water (about two 
quarts to five spoonfuls of ground coffee) and set it on the 
back part of the stove where it will keep hot, but on no 
account allow it to boil, as that destroys the aroma. The 
coffee will be ready to serve in six or eight minutes 
after the hot water has been added. If a drip coffee pot is 
used, the coffee must be ground very fine. Good directions 
usually accompany the different kinds of coffee pots in use.

However, great care must be taken to keep the strainer, 
whether made of cloth or wire, clean and free from all 
obstruction. If made of wire, it should be washed and 
cleaned with a brush, at least once a day. 

Tea. Procure a good quality of tea of whatever kind 
preferred. Scald the teapot (an earthen or 
granite one is the best) and use about a tea- 
spoonful for each person. Use boiling 
water, but do not boil the tea. Steep for a 
few minutes before serving. Black and 
uncolored teas are considered purer and less 
liable to affect the nerves than green teas. 




The Tea Plant. 

Iced Tea. 

before wanted 



Make a pitcherful of tea two or three hours 
It should be made stronger than if it were 
to be served hot, as the melting ice weakens it. About ten 
or fifteen minutes before serving, add to the tea a quantity 
of chopped ice. Put a lump of ice in each cup or glass, and 
serve. ' 

Russian Tea. Russian tea is made by adding a slice 
of lemon to each cup of tea, whether hot or iced. 

Chocolate. Take two quarts of good rich milk, put in a 
double boiler, and let come to a boil. 
Grate fine a little more than a quarter of 
a cake of bitter chocolate, dissolve with 
a little milk, and add to the boiling milk ; 
sweeten to taste; simmer for a few 
minutes after adding the chocolate, and 
serve. 

The Cocoa Bean. 

Broma and Cocoa. Broma and Cocoa can be made 
the same as chocolate. Equal parts of milk and water can 
be used in preparing these drinks, if pure milk is considered 
too rich, but they will be found lacking in flavor, as nothing 
brings out the rich flavors of these compounds like pure 
milk. 




176 Beverages 

Raspberry Shrub. Place red raspberries in a stone 
jar, cover them with good cider vinegar and let stand over 
night. In the morning strain, and to each pint of juice, add 
one pint of sugar; boil for five minutes, skim, and let cool; 
then bottle and cork tightly. 

Hop Beer. Put in a boiler one pound of hops, a hand- 
ful of thoroughwort, and a small bunch of dandelion root; 
add two gallons of water and boil for one hour. Strain and 
cool ; then add four pounds of sugar and one cake of yeast. 
Put in jugs and leave out the corks. When it has stopped 
working, cork, and set in a cool place. This is an excellent 
spring tonic. Drink a small glassful three or four times a 
day. 

Raspberry Vinegar. To every three pints of the 
best vinegar allow four and one-half pints of freshly gath- 
ered raspberries; to each pint of liquor allow one pound of 
pounded loaf sugar, one wineglassful of brandy. Let the 
raspberries be freshly gathered; pick them from the stalks, 
and put one and one-half pint of them into a stone jar, pour 
three pints of the best vinegar over them, and let them re- 
main for twenty-four hours, then strain the liquor over 
another one and one-half pint of fresh raspberries. Let them 
remain another twenty-four hours, and the following day re- 
peat the process for the third time; then drain off the liquor 
without pressing, and pass it through a jelly bag (previously 
wetted with plain vinegar), into a stone jar. Add to every 
pint of the liquor one pound of pounded loaf sugar ; stir 
them together, and when the sugar is dissolved, cover the 
jar; set it upon the fire in a saucepan of boiling water, and 
let it boil for an hour, removing the scum as fast as it rises; 
add to each pint a glass of brandy, bottle it, and seal the 
corks. This is an excellent drink in cases of fevers and 
colds; it should be diluted with cold water, according to the 
taste or requirements of the patient. To be boiled one 
hour. 



Beverages \jj 

Egg Wine. One egg, one tablespoonful and one-half 
glass of cold water, one glass of sherry, sugar, and grated 
nutmeg to taste. Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoon- 
ful of cold water; make the wine and water hot, but not 
boiling; pour on it the egg, stirring all the time. Add suf- 
ficient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture, and a little grated 
nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set it on a gentle 
fire, and stir the contents one way until they thicken, but do not 
allotv them to boil. Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted 
bread or plain crisp biscuits. When the egg is not warmed, 
the mixture will be found easier of digestion, but it is not 
so pleasant a drink. 

Almond Milk. Needed: Two ounces of sweet al- 
monds, one-half ounce of bitter almonds, two ounces of loaf 
sugar, one tablespoonful of orange flower water, one pint of 
spring water. Blanch the almonds and pound them with the 
sugar and orange flower water, in a mortar, adding a few 
drops of water occasionally whilst pounding, to prevent too 
much oiliness. When the mixture looks creamy and smooth, 
pour it into a clean basin, add the cold spring water, and 
stir it with a silver or thin wooden spoon. Leave it for two 
hours, then strain and keep it either on ice or in a very cool 
place, as it is likely otherwise to turn sour. Almond milk 
is served with an equal quantity of water. 

Ching-Ching. A good orange, a few drops of essence 
cloves, ditto peppermint, 3 or 4 lumps of sugar, a tumbler- 
ful of ice. 

Orangeade. Peel of 3, juice of 15 oranges, ^ lb. loaf 
sugar, 2 quarts of water. Peel the three 
oranges thinly and boil the peel with the 
sugar in a pint of water. Press all the 
juice from the oranges through a fine hair 
sieve into a jug. Add the strained syrup and the rest of the 

12 




178 Beverages 

cold water, mix, and stand it on ice for an hour. Serve it 
from cut glass jugs or decanters, and large claret glasses. 

Lemon Syrup. Two lbs. of loaf,sugar,2 pints of water, 
1 oz. of citric acid, Yt. drachm of essence of lemon. Boil the 
sugar and water together for a quarter of an hour, and put it 
into a basin, where let it remain till cold. Beat the citric 
acid to a powder, mix the essence of lemon with it, then 
add these two ingredients to the syrup; mix well, and bottle 
for use. Two tablespoonfuls of the syrup are sufficient for a 
tumbler of cold water, and will be found a very refreshing 
summer drink. Two tablespoonfuls of syrup to a tumblerful 
of cold water. 

Pineapple Water. One large, ripe pineapple, 1 pint 
of boiling syrup, juice of 1 lemon. Peel the pine, slice and 
mash it well in a basin, then pour on the syrup and lemon 
juice; stir well and cover. Let it stand 2 hours, then filter 
through a fine silk sieve and add a quart of spring water. 

Strawberry Water. One lb. of fine strawberries, ^ lb. 
of loaf sugar, juice of 1 lemon. Crush the sugar finely, and 
sift over the strawberries, which should be red and ripe. Add 
half a pint of cold water, filter through a sieve, add a quart 
of spring water, and the strained juice of a lemon. 

Currant Water. One lb. of fine red currants, 5^ lb. of 
raspberries, 1 lb. of crushed loaf sugar water. Pick the 
fruit, add half a pint of water, and crush with a wooden 
spoon, then put the pulp into a preserving pan with half the 
sugar. Stir till it is beginning to simmer, then filter 
through a hair sieve. Make the rest of the sugar into a 
syrup with 3 gills of water, pour it to the fruit syrup, add a 
pint and a half of water. Let it cool, then decant like wine 
for use. 

To Make Essence of Coffee. To every % lb. of 
ground coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of powdered chicory, 



Beverages 1 79 

3 small teacupfuls,or 1 pint of water. Let the coffee be freshly 
ground, and, if possible, freshly roasted; put it into a perco- 
lator, or filter, with the chicory, and pour slowly over it the 
above proportion of bo ; ling water. When it has all filtered 
through, warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the 
simmering point, but do not allow it to boil; then filter it a 
second time, put it into a clean and dry bottle, cork it well, 
and it will remain good for several days. Two tablespoon- 
fuls of this essence are quite sufficient for a breakfastcupful 
of hot milk. This essence will be found particularly use- 
ful to those persons who have to rise extremely early; and 
having only the milk to make boiling, it is very easily and 
quickly prepared. When the essence is bottled, pour 
another >teacupfuls of boiling water slowly on the grounds, 
which, when filtered through, will be a very weak coffee. 
The next time there is essence to be prepared, make this 
weak coffee boiling, and pour it on the ground coffee instead 
of plain water; by this means a better coffee will be 
obtained. Never throw away the grounds without having 
made use of them in this manner; and always cork the bottle 
well that contains this preparation, until the day that it is 
wanted for making the fresh essence. Prepared coffee essence 
can now be bought at a reasonable price, and of good 
quality. It needs to be mixed with boiling water or milk, 
to be filtered once, then brought to the boiling point, and 
allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfastcupful of hot milk. 

Koumiss (sometimes called Milk Beer). Into one quart 
of new milk put one gill of fresh buttermilk and three or 
four lumps of white sugar. Mix well and see that the sugar 
dissolves. Put in warm place to stand ten hours, when it 
will be thick. Pour from one vessel to another until it 
becomes smooth and uniform in consistency. Bottle and 
keep in warm place twenty-four hours; it may take thirty- 
six in winter. The bottles must be tightly corked, and the 
corks tied down. Shake well five minutes before opening. 



180 . Beverages 

It makes a very agreeable drink, which is especially recom- 
mended for persons who do not assimilate their food, and 
young children may drink it as freely as milk. Instead 
of buttermilk, some use a teaspoon of yeast. The richer 
your milk, which should be unskimmed, the better will be 
your koumiss. 

Mulled Buttermilk. The well beaten yelk of an egg 
added to boiling buttermilk and allowed to boil up; or add 
to the boiling buttermilk a little thickening of flour and 
cold buttermilk. 

Baked Milk. Put the milk in a jar, covering the open- 
ing with white paper, and bake in a moderate oven until 
thick as cream. May be taken by the most delicate stomach. 

Elderberry Syrup. Take elderberries perfectly ripe, 
wash and strain them, put a pint of molasses to a pint of 
the juice, boil it twenty minutes, stirring constantly; when 
cold, add to each quart a pint of French brandy; bottle and 
cork it tight. It is an excellent remedy for a cough. 

Strawberry Syrup. Take fine ripe strawberries, crush 
them in a cloth, and press the juice from them; to each pint 
of it put a pint of simple syrup, boil gently for one hour, 
then let it become cold, and bottle it; cork and seal it. 
When served reduce it to taste with water, set it on ice, and 
serve in small tumblers half filled. 

Blackberry Cordial. Secure ripe berries and crush 
them; to each gallon of juice add one quart of boiling 
water; let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring it a few times; 
Strain and add two pounds of sugar to each gallon of liquid; 
put in jugs and cork tightly. It may be used in two months ; is 
excellent for summer complaint, and can be taken by deli- 
cate invalids. 




DISHES FOR INVALIDS 



Beef Tea. Procure two pounds of lean beef, chop into 
small bits and put into'a glass fruit jar; screw on the cover, 
and put the jar in a kettle of cold water; bring to aboil and 
boil for two or three hours; pour off the juice and season to 
taste. 

Beef Broth. Cut some pieces of lean beef into small 
pieces, cover with cold water, and boil until the meat comes 
to pieces; then strain through a colander and let the broth 
stand until cold. Take off any particles of fat that are on 
top, season with salt and pepper, and add small squares of 
toasted bread. Rice, sage, and tapioca, may be used instead 
of toast, if preferred. Other meat broths are made in the 
same manner. 

Rice for Invalids. Take a tablespoonful of rice and 
a pint of milk; put them in an earthen dish and bake in the 
oven for' two hours. Keep the dish covered for the first 
hour, then take off the cover and stir occasionally. Sweeten 
if preferred. This is an excellent diet for persons recover- 
ing from bowel trouble. 

Cornmeal Gruel. Let a pint of water come to a boil; 
then stir in one tablespoonsful of cornmeal, wet with a little 

1S1 



1 82 Dishes for Invalids 

water. Let it boil a few minutes, and season with salt. 
Milk can be added, if preferred. 

Toast Water. Toast a slice of bread very brown, 
break it into pieces, and pour over it a cupful of boiling 
water. When cold it makes a nourishing drink. 

Corn Coffee. Roast an ear of dry corn until the tips 
of the kernels are black. Break the ear in pieces, put in a 
bowl; then pour over it a pint of boiling hot water. Drink 
cold. 

Jelly Water. Put in a tumbler a tablespoonsful of 
currant jelly, and a tablespoonful of wine; mix them 
well together, then fill the glass with ice water. If the 
patient is feverish, leave out the wine. 

Flaxseed Lemonade. Steep two tablespoonfuls of 
flaxseed in one quart of hot water, for ten minutes. Stir in and 
add the juice of three lemons, a large cupful of sugar, and a 
wineglassful of wine. Drink either hot or cold. This is an 
excellent drink for persons suffering with colds or lung 
troubles. 

Appetizers. Patients can often be induced to taste the 
following, when nothing else will tempt them: Scrape raw 
beef very fine and season with salt and pepper. It can be 
made into a sandwich, if preferred. Second: Roast over 
the coals a small slice of salt pork until almost burnt. A 
little taste of this often creates an appetite. 

To Make Gruel for Invalids. Take i tablespoon- 
ful of Robinson's patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls of cold 
water, 1 pint of boiling water. Mix the prepared groats 
smoothly with the cold water in a basin; pour over them the 
boiling water, stirring it all the time. Put it into a very 
clean saucepan; boil the gruel for 10 minutes, keeping it 
well stirred, sweeten to taste, and serve. It may be flavored 
with a small piece of lemon peel, by boiling it in the gruel, 



Dishes for Invalids 183 

or a little grated nutmeg may be put in ; but in these matters 
the taste of the patient should be consulted. Pour the gruel 
in a tumbler, and serve. When wine is allowed to the 
invalid, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make this prep- 
aration very nice. In cases of colds, the same quantity of 
spirits is sometimes added instead of wine. Fine oatmeal 
may be used, but it then requires rather longer boiling. 

The Invalid's Mutton Chop. A well broiled chop 
is a very digestible thing to give to an invalid. It should be 
cut fairly thin and thoroughly well cooked. None of the 
skin should be eaten of this or any meat. A fresh tomato is 
a wholesome and digestible accompaniment. To vary a diet 
of chops, of which most invalids tire, one may be cut from 
the loin, the next day the bone can be taken out and the 
chop rolled up and skewered, and a third, 1 or 2 tiny cutlets 
from the neck might be served. The greatest care must be 
taken that the meat should not have the slightest taint, which 
is most likely to be in the under part or in the marrow. The 
under cut of a loin of mutton is a very good and tender piece 
of meat to serve to an invalid. 

Whey. To a pint of warm new milk add a teaspoonful 
of prepared rennet. Let it stand, and then strain it through 
a piece of muslin. This can sometimes be taken when milk 
cannot. It is a useful drink in feverish complaints. 

White wine whey is made by pouring a wineglassful of 
sherry into a breakfast cupful of boiling milk, and then 
straining through muslin. 

Treacle posset is made of boiling milk, with 1 or 2 table- 
spoonfuls of treacle, in the same way. Alum whey and 
tamarind whey are also occasionally made. 

Irish Moss or Carrageen. This seaweed has a rep- 
utation as a remedy for chest diseases. It should be first 
soaked and washed in cold water, and then boiled for a 
quarter of an hour in fresh water, allowing half an ounce of 



184 Dishes for Invalids 

moss to a pint and a half of water. Strain, and when cold 
it will set to a jelly. If required as a drink, it should have 
double the quantity of water, or milk can be used. 

Iceland Moss. Wash the moss very thoroughly. Put 
it in cold water, and let it nearly boil. Throw this first 
water away, as it will be bitter. Then put the moss on again 
with water, allowing 1 oz. of moss to a pint and a half of 
water. Boil it for 15 or 20 minutes, and strain it while hot. 
It should be sweetened, and flavored with lemon or spice. 
Milk can be used instead of water. It is a slightly bitter drink, 
or if a sufficient quantity of the moss is used it cools into a 
jelly. 

Cream of Tartar Drink. Dissolve half an ounce of 
cream of tartar in half a pint of syrup of sugar and water, 
add 20 drops of essence of lemon, and keep it in a bottle to 
be diluted with water, or soda water, as required. It will 
keep a long time. 

Baked Beef Tea. One pound of fleshy beef, one and 
one-half pints of water, one-half saltspoonful 
of salt. Cut the beef into small square 
pieces, after trimming off all the fat, and 
put it into a baking jar, with the above pro- 
portion of water and salt; cover the jar 
well, place it in a warm, but not hot, oven, 
and bake for three or four hours. When 
the oven is very fierce in the daytime, it is 
The Marjoram, a good plan to put the jar in at night, and 
let it remain till the next morning, when the tea will be 
done. It should be strained, and put by in a cool place until 
wanted. It may also be flavored with an onion, a clove, 
and a few sweet herbs, etc. , when the stomach is sufficiently 
strong to take these. 

Panada for Invalids. These are rather different 
from what is understood by panada in the ordinary routine 




Dishes for Invalids 185 

of cooking. They are useful in invalid cookery because 
whatever they are made of is finely divided. The following 
recipe is given by Dr. F. V. Pavy: Take the white part of 
the breast and wings freed from skin, of either roasted or 
boiled chicken, or the under side of cold sirloin of roasted 
beef; or cold roasted leg of mutton, and pound in a mortar 
with an equal quantity of stale bread. Add either the water 
in which the chicken has been boiled, or beef tea, until the 
whole forms a fluid paste, and then boil for ten minutes, 
stirring all the time. 

Panada. (Another Mode.) Take of pearl barley or 
rice two ounces, wash and put it in a saucepan with half a 
pound of veal or mutton cut in small pieces, and half a pint 
of water. Simmer it all very gently for two hours, or set it 
in the oven all night. Then pound it in a mortar and rub it 
through a fine sieve. Add a little cream to make it as thin 
as desired, with seasoning to taste, and serve it hot or cold; 
or to the meat and barley pounded add a handful of bread 
crumbs and the yolk of one or two eggs. Poach it in 
dessertspoonfuls and serve with any vegetable and a little 
milk sauce. 

Restorative Jelly. Three ounces of isinglass, two ounces 
of gum arabic, two ounces of sugar candy, a bottle of sherry. 
Put them in a jar, cover it closely, and let it stand all night; 
then set it in a saucepan of water, and let it simmer until it 
is dissolved. 

Sago, Cream, and Extract of Beef. Two ounces 
of sago, one-half pint of water, one-half pint of cream, 
yolks of four eggs, one quart of beef tea. Wash the sago 
until the water poured from it is clear. Then stew the sago 
in half a pint of water until it is quite tender and very 
thick; mix with half a pint of good cream and the yolks of 
four eggs, and mingle the whole with one quart of beef tea, 
which should be boiling. Useful in cases of lingering con- 
valescence after acute disease.

The Invalid's Cutlet. One nice cutlet from a loin or 
neck of mutton, two teacupfuls of water, one very small 
stick of celerv, pepper and salt to taste. Have the cutlet 
cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton; take off all the 
fat; put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; stew 
very gently indeed for nearly two hours, and skim off every 
particle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to 
time. The eelery should be cut into thin slices before it is 
added to the meat, and care must be taken not to put in too 
-much of this ingredient, or the dish will not be good. If 
the water is allowed to boil, the cutlet will be hard. It is 
better cooked in a jar set in a saucepan of water, as it must 
then be below boiling point. 

Eel Broth. One-half pound of eels, a small bunch of 
sweet herbs, including parsley; one- 
half onion, ten peppercorns, three 
pints of water, two cloves, salt and 
pepper to taste. After having cleaned 
covered silver Dish. and skinned the eel, cut it into small 
pieces, and put it into a stewpan with the other ingredients; 
simmer gently until the liquid is reduced nearly half, care- 
fully removing the scum as it rises. Strain it through a hair 
sieve; put it by in a cool place, and when wanted, take off 
all the fat from the top, warm up as much as is required, 
and serve with sippets of toasted bread. This is very nutri- 
tious broth, and easy of digestion. 

Calf s Foot Blancmange. One calf's foot, one quart 
of milk, one egg, sugar, nutmeg and lemon, or seasoning to 
taste. Get a calf's foot that has been already cooked, such 
as is sold in first-class markets and put it on the fire with 
milk enough to cover it, a strip of lemon peel, a piece of 
nutmeg, and sugar to taste. Let it cook very slowly for 
three or four hours, and then strain it. While still hot stir 
in the yolk of an egg, and set it in small moulds. This 




Dishes for Invalids 187 

blancmange can be made savory by using a little salt, 
peppercorns, parsley, nutmeg or cloves, onion and celery 
instead of the sugar. The lemon peel may be added in any 
case. The egg may be omitted if not liked; a little cream 
might also be added. It is directed that small moulds shall 
be used. For an invalid, it is better to set just as much as 
is wanted for one meal rather than to cut a piece out of a 
large quantity. 

Arrowroot. Use milk or water as preferred. Put a 
heaping teaspoonful of ground arrowroot into a cup, and mix 
with a little cold milk. Stir into a pan containing a pint of 
either cream or water that has been brought to a boil, adding 
a little salt. Let it simmer for a few minutes, and then pour 
out. May be sweetened or flavored with grated nutmeg if 
desired. Should be made only as it is wanted. 

Herb Teas. Made by infusing the dried or green stalks 
and leaves in boiling water, and letting stand until cold. 
Sweeten to taste. 

Jellied Chicken. Cook six chickens in a small quantity 
of water, until the meat will part from the bone easily; sea- 
son to taste with salt and pepper. Just as soon as cold 
enough to handle, remove bones and skin; place meat in a 
deep pan or mould just as it comes from the bone, using giz- 
zard, liver and heart, until the mould is nearly full. To the 
water left in the kettle add three-fourths of a box of good 
gelatine (some add juice of lemon) dissolved in a little warm 
water, and boil until it is reduced to a little less than a 
quart, pour over the chicken in the mould, leave to cool, cut 
with a very sharp -knife and serve. The slices will not 
easily break up if directions are followed. 

Slippery Elm Bark Tea. Break the bark into bits, pour 
boiling water over it, cover, and let it infuse until cold. 
Sweeten, ice, and take for summer disorders, or add lemon 
juice and drink for a bad cold. 




THE DINNER TABLE 



General Rules. Whether the table is to be covered 
with the most costly viands or the most simple fare, whether 
it be for prince or tradesman, there is yet equal necessity 
that the cloth should be spotless and good, the cutlery well 
cleaned and sharp, the silver polished brightly, and the glass 
clear. These are luxuries within the reach of all. We say 
''luxuries"' because we all know the comfort of a well-laid 
table, and yet there are many who do not trouble themselves 
about the usual everyday laying of the cloth, only making 
a point of this being carefully done when guests are expectd. 
We would venture to suggest that if the mistress of a house- 
hold would see that her table was properly laid every day she 
would find it less trouble than the anxiety of having it so 
only now and then, and much of the annoyance which the 

188 



The Dinner Table 189 

occasional dropping in of a friend at meal time often causes 
could be spared. Beside^, though perhaps this point should 
not be discussed here, why should our ordinary family table 
differ so widely, as we confess it does too often, from the 
table we like our friends to see us preside at? It is because 
we have let "only ourselves" take a broader, wider meaning 
than it should have. "Only ourselves" stands too often as 
the apology for a dirty cloth, unpolished cutlery and silver, 
and smeared glass, to say nothing of perhaps negligent cook- 
ery into the bargain. And is it not a notable fact that when 
we do give a dinner-party, we strive our utmost to carry off 
the affair with ease and nonchalance, and are vexed if the 
secret be discovered — more than vexed — that to do this has 
been a source of worry and hard work ever since we 
projected the scheme? It is seldom, too, that we succeed in 
keeping the secret to ourselves, and our friends sometimes 
maliciously enjoy it. 

The sideboard for all meals should be covered with a 
clean white cloth and all that is wanted for each meal — in 
addition to what is placed upon the table — that can be 
brought into the dining-room, should there be ready for use, 
with the addition of knives, forks, glasses, etc., in case such 
may be required, but as the sideboard will have to be laid 
differently for different meals, it will be best to arrange 
it separately for each. A sideboard should be an orna- 
mental as well as useful piece of furniture, and may be as 
carefully and prettily laid out as the table itself. 

Everything needed in laying a cloth should be 
first brought into the room in which the table is to be laid, 
and what you are about to partake of should be your guide 
as to what you require. For instance if fish is to be served 
then fish-eaters must be placed to each person, or failing 
these, two extra forks may be given. In the same way when 
soup is to be served then put on the necessary spoons at the 



igo The Dinner Table 

right side, while the other courses must determine what 
knives and forks will be needed. The same rule applies to 
the glasses put upon the table, always to the right hand of 
each person. If you give three wines then put three glasses 
of the proper kinds, if only one, then put one glass, and if 
none, only the tumblers which may serve for either water or 
beer. It is only in hotels that everything is laid irrespective 
of what may be ordered. Salt is a necessary accompaniment 
to every meal and it is a great convenience to have plenty of 
small salt-cellars, one to each person, or one between two. 
To avoid the trouble of passing, pepper, mustard, etc., may 
also be placed upon the table or handed round by the ser- 
vants, but as the serving of one meal does not apply to 
another one must prepare differently the different tables — 
Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Tea or Supper. 

Table Cloths and Napkins. Anybody knowing how 
to lay a cloth properly and tastefully, prettily and neatly, knows 
something decidedly worth knowing. The first, or almost the 
first, attention bestowed by a young wife upon her household 
affairs should be directed to the laying of the meal cloth. Just 
as she begins, so, doubtless, she will go on. The laying of 
the cloth is a most important item in household management ; 
it exercises a certain moral influence upon the inmates of the 
house in the degree of care or thought that is bestowed upon 
it. This is a point which, we hope, will not be lost sight 
of by our readers. 

The serviettes or table napkins should be neatly 
and tastefully folded when first put on the table, although 
afterward in ordinary family use they may be put into rings. 
We give instructions and illustrations showing a few ways 
of making these useful articles an ornament to the table, on 
the following pages. It is a good plan to place them upon the 
table first so that one can apportion the space allowed 
for each person and make the napkins equi-distant, and in

A WORD OF ADVICE 

The first thing to be 
thought of is the dinner, and 
varying that very good old 
maxim, "Cut your cloak ac- 
cording to your cloth," we 
should say, choose your dinner 
according to your cook. When 
fortunate enough to possess a 
good one, one need not be 
afraid of trying a few experi- 
ments ; otherwise it is a danger- 
ous thing, and if any contre- 
temps occur, it is the mistress; 
and not the cook, who suffers. 

No hostess is likely to be 
quite happy or at ease, with 
any fear on her mind as to how 
the next course will turn out. 

Far better is it to have a 
simple dinner, which one 
knows will be properly cooked 
and served, than to risk any- 
thing more elaborate, for it is 
almost impossible to appear 
unconcerned when one is har- 
assed by petty cares, and a 
good hostess is one who is 
able herself to enjoy, without 
anxiety, the dinner she is 
giving to her friends.

RULES FOR DINNER GIVING 

Rule i. — Let your family dinner hour be at a given hour, 
and let that hour be the dinner hour. Allow no shirking here 
from any one, unless accident or circumstances render such 
compulsory. Then you stand some chance of being able to 
turn your cookery talents, if you have any, to account. 

Rule 2. — Always arrange your dinner, having a kind of 
mind's-eye menu, satisfactorily beforehand, before you 
attempt either to give directions concerning it or to help, it 
may be, in its preparation. Without this, you may give your 
family or your guests an eatable dinner now and then, but 
as a general rule, it will be a failure. 

Rule 3. — For a "hot dinner" let the plates be hot, not 
warm merely, but hot. The best dinner you can give guests 
will be spoiled if you serve it to them on plates in which 
almost before they begin to eat the gravy floats about in 
small, island-like patches. 

Rule 4. — Give due attention to the customary order of 
courses. You do not want your fish, for instance, ready 
before the soup, causing the former to look flabby, and most 
likely break and lose its trim appearance. 

Rule 5. — Be careful in dishing vegetables, that they are 
perfectly drained from water. Turnips or other edibles of 
the kind swimming about in a sea of dingy water are enough 
to cause the excellence of the cookery or the other viands to 
be put in the shade. 




TABLE ETIQUETTE. 



These very simple and practical rules are especially 
intended for the training of children, and as such, will be 
kindly received by busy parents. They will also be found 
useful as reminders for those grown up people who may have 
forgotten some of the necessary requisites of "Good Table 
Manners" — the infallible touch stone of a lady or a gentle- 
man's breeding. 

Make a point to be on time at family meals. - Exactitude 
is the politeness of kings — and of well bred people. 

Never come to the table in a neglected attire, or in your 
shirt sleeves, or with hair unkempt, or with hands and face of 
doubtful cleanliness. Your home is a temple, not a pig-stye. 

If there are ladies in the party do not sit down before they 
are themselves seated. 

Sit down square to the table, not sideways, or leaning 
back in your chair as if to take a nap instead of a meal. 

Never allow your elbows to rest on the table. Let your 
hands — when not busy — rest on the edge of the table. 

Do not tuck your napkin under your chin, or between the 
buttons of your waistcoat; put it across your lap. 

196 



Table Etiquette . 197 

If you sport a beard or mustache, use your napkin 
frequently to wipe away any unnoticed drop or crumb. 

Never use your napkin to mop your face with. 

Never cut your bread with a knife; bread is made to be 
broken, not cut, when once off the loaf. 

Make no noise with your mouth when eating or drinking, 
especially when eating soup. 

Never attempt to talk with a mouth half full. 

Eat without haste; do not take huge mouthfuls. 

Keep your elbows as close to your side as possible when 
cutting your meat or carrying spoon or fork to your mouth. 

Do not throw your head back when drinking, nor drink a 
full glass at a time without stopping for breath. 

Take care that all the ladies in the party except possibly 
your own daughters — are served before you. 

If you have ladies by your side, attend, unobtrusively, to 
their wants, offering to fill their glasses, pass the bread, the 
salt, etc. 

Never, under any circumstances, use your knife for any other 
purpose except cutting your meat. Knives are not to be put 
in contact with mouths. 

Try your best to eat all vegetables — peas included — with 
the help of your fork. A famous society man who stood as a 
model of good manners, claimed that he could bring every- 
thing to his mouth by means of a fork — except tea, coffee 
and soup 

Bring your spoon to your mouth sideways, not point fore- 
most, and absorb its contents noiselessly. 

Never pour the contents of your cup in your saucer, under 
pretence of cooling the beverage. Be patient awhile and 
drink from the cup direct, or with the help of a spoon. 

When eating meat, hold it down on the plate with your 



198 Table Etiquette 

fork, while cutting it; knife in the right hand, fork in the 
left hand. When one piece is cut off let the knife go noise- 
lessly by the side of the plate, and taking the fork in your 
right — almost horizontally — bring the morsel to your mouth. 

Do not cut all your meat at one and the same time, but 
proceed as above; a little practice will make the task easy 
and graceful. 

The fork is to be held with the handle in the palm of the 
hand and be gently brought from plate to mouth ; the fingers 
stretched along the handle in a natural position. Always 
remember it is a fork, not a pitchfork. 

Do not place a provision of anything (salt or olives or 
almonds) next to you on the tablecloth; nor place there 
fruit or potato peelings. 

If you do not accept of one course, wait until the others 
are through with it before accepting of the next. 

Do not butter a whole slice of bread; butter fragment 
after fragment. 

Never encourage a dog or cat to play with you at the table 

Do not get up from the table before the others do ; your 
home is not a restaurant; the home you are invited to, still 
less. 

Never take any food in your hands, except fruit. Mutton 
chops and fowls' legs and wings are not to be held in the 
fingers while being eaten. Civilized beings do not devour, 
they eat. 

Do not clean your plate, with your bread or otherwise; it 
would look as if you were famished or miserly, which let 
us hope you are not. 

When peeling fruit or potatoes hold them at the end of 
your fork — in the left hand — and peel them with your knife 
— in the right. 



Table Etiquette 199 

It is awful to have to say this, but do not, keep, or bring 
a cuspidor in the dining room. 

When eating grapes or cherries, hold your right hand 
close to your mouth, and discreetly dispose — upon your 
plate — of the stones and skins. 

Never carry fruit, confectionery or anything else from 
the table, except for a sick person and by special permission 
of the hostess. 

Never wear gloves at the table. 

Be careful not to drop or break or spill anything. If some 
such accident happens to you, take it calmly, excusing your- 
self to the hostess. 

When sneezing or coughing, turn your face aside, or better 
hide it behind your handkerchief. 

Avoid stretching your hand over other people's plates to 
reach anything. Rather ask for it, or do without. 

Don't ask for a second service of soup or fish. 

Never leave the spoon in your cup when bringing it to 
your lips. 

When sending your plate for a second service of meat, 
or vegetables, or sweets, take away your fork and knife, 
and lay them on your right, side by side, and perpendicular 
to the table's edge. 

If you are the host (or hostess) do not press any dish 
upon your guests. Out of misjudged courtesy they might 
eat more of it than they care to. 

If finger bowls are brought upon the table at the close of 
a meal, only wet the tip of your fingers, passing them 
slightly over your lips. Remember this little glass vessel 
is not intended as a wash basin. 

In a dinner by invitation, the host leads the way from the 
drawing room to the dining room, having on his arm the 
lady he wishes particularly to honor. Each gentleman then 



200 Table Etiquette 

follows escorting the lady the hostess has requested him to 
"take in." The hostess comes last with the gentleman who 
is entitled to most consideration on this special occasion. 

If the gentlemen do not stay in the dining room after the 
ladies' withdrawal — according to the English custom — the 
party returns to the drawing room in couples, as before, the 
hostess this time leading the way, and the host closing the 
march. 

If the gentlemen are to stay in the dining room, they all 
rise when the hostess gives the signal for the ladies to with- 
draw, and the gentleman nearest to the exit opens the door 
with a bow, closing it after all the ladies have filed out. 

After the lapse of about half an hour the butler, or 
waitress, announces that coffee is served in the drawing 
room, and the gentlemen join the ladies. 

The half hour before dinner has always been considered 
as the great ordeal through which the mistress, in giving a 
dinner party, will either pass with flying colors, or lose many 
of her laurels. The mistress, however, must display no kind 
of agitation, but show her tact in suggesting light and cheer- 
ful subjects of conversation, which will be much aided by 
the introduction of any particularly new book, curiosity of 
art, or article of vertu, which may pleasantly engage the 
attention of the company. "Waiting for Dinner," however, 
is a trying time, and there are few who have not felt — 

" How sad it is to sit and pine, 
The long half hour before we dine, 
Upon our watches oft to look, 
Then wonder at the clock and cook, 
* * * v >(c * * 

And strive to laugh in spite of Fate, 
But laughter forced soon quits the room, 
And leaves it in its former gloom. 
But lo ! the dinner now appears — 
The object of our hopes and fears, 
The end of all our pain !" 




ARTISTIC COOKERY 



There are many occasions — such as gala dinners, ban- 
quets, marriage luncheons, silver weddings, etc., — when 
the mistress of the house is desirous of displaying some 
extra talent and introducing to her delighted guests some 
dish of unusual size or merit, surrounded by those beautiful 
little conceits which have made the reputation of French 
cooks. 

We should have failed in one of our clearest duties in not 
giving a place in Treasures Old and New, to a select 
number of those ornamental and exquisite specimens of 

201 



202 Artistic Cookery 

what ought to be called 

Artistic Cookery ; 

and, although it is going somewhat' out of our original plan 
of treating only of simple and home-made dishes, we insert 
in this volume forty-seven descriptions (with steel plate 
illustrations), of some of the best examples of foreign cook- 
ery, such as is daily presented upon the tables of Europe's 
grandees. 

We may add that both descriptions and designs are the 
work of the famous Chef of the court of Germany, 
Monsieur Urbain Dubois. 

In these descriptions will be found a few, a very few 
technical words, but any hotel cook of average experience 
knows their meaning, and may be easily consulted concern- 
ing it. 

Our purpose, we may add, is to furnish, in this depart- 
ment, some first class information for professional cooks, 
always in quest of something new and unique. 

FISH 

See Plate No. i 

Blue Fish. In form the blue fish resembles the salmon, 
or rather the houchen of Bavaria. Its lower jaw protrudes 
like that of the be'car. The head is very big, its skin bluish, 
and to this tint it owes its name. It is one of the prettiest 
fish in the New World. Its flesh, when cooked, assumes a 
slightly dull blue color, and remains soft. This fish usually 
weighs as muclras ten pounds; from its size it therefore con- 
stitutes a remove, which can be served at a large dinner. If 
cooked whole, the blue fish is usually served broiled; if 
cooked in a court bouillon, it ought to be divided into slices. 
Filets of the blue fish are often served, cut, sautes with but- 
ter, and garnished either a la Normande or a la Joinville. 



Artistic Cookery—Plate No. i 




Blue Fish. Shad, maitre d' hotel. Black Fish. 

Cod Fish with Oyster Sauce. Salmon Trout, a la Chambord. 



Artistic Ctokery 203 

The Shad is very good, broiled "a la maitre-d'hotel;" 
but is also excellent, braised in wine, with little liquid, 
dished up with a "matelote" or a "genoise"-sauce; if the shad 
is to be broiled, it ought previously to be crimped. With 
broiled shad, butter "a la maitre-d'hotel," and a garnish of 
sorrel, are usually served; the latter ought to be served sep- 
arately. If braised, it may be surrounded with any garnish 
applicable to removes of fish. 

Black Fish. The physiognomy of the black fish is indeed 
remarkable. If in the drawing, the body of the fish be 
covered, as far as the lateral fin, with a piece of paper, it 
will be found, that the expression of the head is somewhat 
similar to that of the tiger. Its jaws are very strong, fur- 
nished inside with large teeth, and the surfaces of the pal- 
ate are provided with very hard asperities; which confirms 
the opinion that this fish feeds more particularly on Crustacea. 
The skin of the black fish is black, and very much like that 
of the tench. Its cooked flesh is white and firm, and much 
esteemed by epicures. It possesses a gelatinous principle, 
which renders it suitable to concentrated cooking, that is 
braising. 

This fish attains a weight of from five to six pounds; if 
served whole, it may be surrounded with a fine garnish, and 
accompanied with a brown sauce, Matelote, Bordelaise, or 
Ge'noise. 

The Cod is generally cooked in salted water, and plunged 
in while boiling; but if the fish is entire, it is only neces- 
sary to plunge it into lukewarm water well salted. An entire 
cod takes very long boiling, for it must be cooked without 
ebullition; that is to say, that at the first boiling of the 
liquid, the kettle must be placed on the side of the fire, so 
that the liquid may simmer only, without the ebullition 
making itself evident. With boiled cod nothing but a good 
sauce and boiled potatoes, ought to be served; other gar- 



204 Artistic Cookery 

nishes do not harmonize well with this sort of fish. Oyster 
sauce is most in use; but in Holland it is served simply with 
good melted butter. This dish, so delicate, if the fish is 
quite fresh and properly cooked, is far from possessing the 
same merit, if stale and negligently cooked; these two ob- 
stacles are easily removed, if the cook is intelligent, and is 
aware of the responsibility attached to his or her office. 

The Trout represented in the drawing is stuffed, and 
trussed, then fixed on the drainer of a fish-kettle, taking care 
to place it on its belly; it is covered with a good "court- 
bouillon," and cooked in it; the liquor must be poured out 
cold on the fish; it is afterward brought to ebullition, but 
immisdiately removed from the fire. A salmon-trout of about 
ten pounds must remain an hour and a quarter in its liquor 
kept at the same degree of heat, but without any visible 
ebullition. 

The trout is dished immediately, resting on its belly; but, 
for more safety, it must be kept in equilibrium by means of 
fried bread crusts put on the dish, so as to keep the fish upright; 
this bread must be masked with raw force-meat, and poached 
in the oven. 

The garnish which surrounds the fish, is composed on one 
side of mushroom-heads, whole truffles, small quenelles, 
shaped with a tea-spoon, as well as ornamented quenelles; 
on the other side it is composed of carp-milts, crayfish tails, 
or a whole crayfish with the tails trimmed, and lastly with 
quenelles. All these garnishes are. slightly masked with 
"genevoise" or "matelote"-sauce; the remainder is served up 
in a sauce-boat. 



Artistic Cookery 205 

REMOVES, ENTREES AND ROASTS 

See Plates Nos. 2, 3 and 4. 

Lobster Cutlets a la Victoria. This entree is dished 
up on a croustade, made of fried bread, composed of two 
pieces. When the top of the croustade is fried, the upper 
surface is slightly hollowed out, the empty space masked 
with a coating of force-meat, which afterward is poached in 
the oven, or in the hot closet. The cutlets are composed of 
cooked lobster flesh, cut in small dice, and mixed with an 
equal quantity of blanched oysters, and as many truffles as 
lobsters, cut in the same manner. This salpicon is mixed 
with a £e'c/iamet-sa.uce well reduced, finished with crayfish- 
butter; it is afterward spread on a baking-sheet, the coating 
being about three-quarters of an inch; let it cool there; then 
it is divided into the shape of cutlets, which are immediately 
masked with a thin coat of raw quenelle force-meat, dipped 
in beaten eggs, crumbed, and fried in a saute -pan with 
clarified butter. When well drained, each gets a small frill, 
and they are dressed in a circle, the cavity of which is gar- 
nished with crayfish tails. A matelote or JVo r ma ude -sauce is 
served separately. 

Sheeps' Tongues, a la Dominicaine. This entree 
suits better for a supper, or rather for a ball-buffet, than for 
a dinner; however, it can always be admitted in a dinner, if 
preceded or followed by cold entrees of another kind. 

The sheeps' tongues must be salted a t'e'ear/ate, cooked, 
well trimmed, and well glazed; they are dished on a jelly- 
border. The tongues do not rest on the border, the latter 
having its cavity filled with a circle of wood, on the center 
of which is fixed a support, that is masked with butter, or 
paper. The round, and the support, are covered over with 
salad, composed of vegetabJjs, cut into the form of small 



206 Artistic Cookery 

dice, and mixed with some mayonnaise, prepared with aspic- 
jelly. On the top of the support is fixed a small cup of fat, 
the base of which is sunk into a thick string of chopped 
aspic-jelly. A sauce-boatful of egg-mayonnaise, is sent up 
with this entree. 

Ham "Historie." The sucking-pig represented in the 
plate, which in reality is not a sucking-pig, but only has the 
form of one, is in modeled butter; it is only on the back, 
that the ham is placed. To shape the latter neatly, it should 
first be entirely boned, wrapped round with a napkin, and so 
cooked; when done, it is taken out of the napkin to be 
wrapped up again, and left to cool in the required form; when 
trimmed and neatly carved, the small animal, which must 
bear it, should be carved. The piece is surrounded with 
pretty plaited paper-cases, garnished with glazed truffles; 
the base of the "pain-vert" is surrounded with bold croiUons 
of aspic-jelly, an indispensable garnish to cold pieces. 

Salmis of Woodcocks. This entree is dished up, on 
a border of game force-meat, on the center of which is fixed 
a pyramidal croustade of fried bread. It is against this, that 
the entree is placed; for without this support it would be 
impossible to give it the required height and regularity. 
The legs of the woodcock form the base of the pyramid, the 
filets are placed on the center; the breast-pieces are set 
upright, with a few truffles at their base; and on the top of 
the croustade is inserted a skewer, garnished with a truffle. 
The woodcocks, and the border, are slightly masked with a 
salmis sauce, reduced with an extract of game, and with the 
raw trimmings of truffles; the remainder of the sauce is sent 
up in a sauce-boat. This entree is edged with nom'1/e-pa.ste. 
Salmis sauce is prepared from some Espagnole, well drained, 
thickened on a brisk fire, and stirred continually. A few 
tablespoonfuls of extract of game, a little good cooked 
Madeira sauce, are introduced gradually.

Mayonnaise of Chickens with Jelly. To prepare 
this entree, two good chickens must be trussed, wrapped up 
in slices of bacon, cooked in a good mirepoix, but kept lightly 
cooked. When the chickens have cooled, each of them is 
divided into five parts; these are carefully trimmed, the skin, 
as well as the superfluous bones removed; particularly of the 
pinions, and fat of the thighs. The parts of the chickens 
are put into an earthen basin, marinated for an hour, then 
masked with a layer of mayonnaise sauce with jelly, and 
arranged on a baking sheet. As soon as the sauce has set, 
the pieces are trimmed again, and covered with a layer of 
half-set aspic jelly. They are removed with the aid of a 
fork, but must be touched as little as possible, and dished 
in a pyramid shape, in the hollow of an aspic-jelly border, 
and turned out on a cold dish. Care must be taken, that 
this border be previously filled with a support of bread, 
masked with butter, lest the filling up should injure the aspic- 
jelly. A sauce-boatful of mayonnaise of eggs, is sent up 
with this entree. 

Patties a la Financiere. To render these hot patties 
acceptable to an epicure, they ought to be prepared with a 
good short paste, melting in the mouth, and well baked. The 
outside of the patties ought to be of a nice brown, and 
the inside be filled with a well chosen garnish, mixed 
with a good sauce. These patties are dished in a pyr- 
amid on a napkin; but in order that this pyramid 
may be firm, a foundation of bread should be gummed 
to the dish. The space where the circle of patties rests im- 
mediately on the napkin, ought to be filled up with a bouquet 
of fried parsley. Patties, that is to say, cases of paste, may 
be cooked filled with flour, or with common force-meat. A 
moment before serving, they are emptied and filled anew with 
a ragout composed of fat liver, cocks'-kernels, cocks'-combs, 
and truffles. This ragout is thickened with a good "sauce Es- 



208 Artistic Cookery 

pagnole" reduced with port- wine or madeira. The patties 
are dished up on a folded napkin. 

Filets of Snipes in Cases. Small cases of folded 
paper may be purchased everywhere, either of round or oval 
shape. Paper cases must be oiled previously to being gar- 
nished; if their garnish consists of moist materials, the cases 
can be double. To prepare this dish, the filets of seven or 
eight snipes must be removed, trimmed, and placed in a 
"saute"-pan to be cooked with clarified butter. A puree is 
prepared with cooked legs of snipes, a few poultry-livers, a 
small part of the giblets of game, some boiled rice, a little 
sauce, and a piece of butter. The filets are cooked just be- 
fore sending to table; the puree is warmed without ebulli- 
tion, and the cases filled up with the latter. On the puree, 
a filet of a snipe is placed, then masked immediately with a 
little good brown sauce, reduced with the perfume of game. 
The cases are ranged on a baking-sheet, to be kept a few 
minutes at the mouth of the oven, in order to give brilliance 
to the sauce covering the filets. The cases are afterward 
dished up on a folded napkin. 

Loin ofVeal a La Montglas. A fine loin of veal, 
white and fat, is a remove of the first order, which can be 
admitted in all dinners. The loin must be cut rather long, . 
trimmed, then trussed, roasted or baked in the oven ; if 
baked, care must be taken that no liquid be added; it must 
be cooked in butter and its own fat, without any other liquid, 
but with moderate heat; if roasted on the spit, it must be 
wrapped up in buttered paper, and allowed to remain for two 
hours in front of the fire, not forgetting to unfasten it in 
time to give it a nice color; it is better to cook the kidney 
by itself. 

When the loin is done, the lower and the upper filet must 
be taken out, the latter cut through and put back in its place; 
then the loin is dished on a thick layer of thin mashed pota-

toes, or anything else put on the dish, to keep in the same 
place; on one of the extremities of a dish, or even upon 
both, there is fixed a pretty croustade of rice, or bread, or a 
large white turnip, cut in three parts. The loin is surrounded 
with two bunches of sweetbread croquettes, between these 
some small patties are dished up, garnished with a montglas 
of sweetbread and truffles. On the other side of the dish are 
two heaps of potatoes a la duchesse, divided by the kidney 
cut in slices. The two cups are garnished with a montglas 
prepared with the under filet and truffles, mixed with a 
cream sauce. There must not be any sauce at the bottom of 
the dish; but the loin may be accompanied with a half 
Espagnole, or a light tomato sauce. With veal, some salt 
meat, ham, or tongue a /'ecar/ate, is generally served. 

Piece of Beef a La Jardiniere. This piece is taken 
from the loin of the ox; that is to say, that part which, 
starting at the extremity of the sirloin, stops at the junction 
of the lower part of the thigh; the quarter of beef. The loin 
is the most delicate, savory, and agreeable part of the 
animal, because the fibers and flesh are rich and interlarded. 
Done to the exact point, in a good stock, well glazed and 
garnished, served very hot, the loin of beef can be admitted to 
the most sumptuous dinners, and will always be welcome. The 
loin of beef is a rich showy piece, but costly; as fine an ap- 
pearance as possible must be given to it, in which case it 
is difficult to employ less than about 30 pounds of meat; for 
the most delicate part of the loin, what is called the chubb, 
would not be sufficient to form a remove; a sufficient 
quantity of meat must therefore be left on it, to give a good 
shape. The loin of beef, coming from a fine animal, must 
be covered with a thick coat of fat; after having been boned, 
it is rolled in its natural way lengthwise, then tied firmly 
with a string, put into a long stewpan, in which is laid some 
bacon, cut roots and vegetables; the meat is slightly salted, 

14 



210 Artistic Cookery 

then moistened and covered with light broth; it must remain 
in the liquid from 6 to 7 hours, on a very moderate fire, 
with hot ashes on the lid. When three parts done, it is 
drained, to trim it underneath; then put back into the pan, 
with the stock, strained, skimmed, and mixed, with a little 
white wine; it must be finished thus in the good, succulent, 
richly colored stock. It is dished up on a piece of cooked 
meat ; this must be cooled under a press, trimmed to the re- 
quired size, warmed, and placed at' the bottom of the dish. 
This foundation relieves the aspect of the piece, and facili- 
tates the dishing up of the garnishes. The piece of beef is 
represented, carved in slices, surrounded with a garnish of 
fine, fresh, and tender vegetables, divided into bunches; this 
garnish may also be composed of green peas, French beans, 
cauliflowers, young carrots, glazed turnips; but too many 
kinds should not be used. 

Then the piece is dished up, and glazed with a brush; 
it is ornamented with three different vegetables, and skew- 
ers; the liquid in which it has been cooked is sieved, 
skimmed, thinned, and mixed with a few spoonfuls of 
Espagnole and tomato sauce. This sauce is served in a 
sauce boat, hot. 

Sweet Breads a La Colbert. This is a simple and 
good meat entree, which can very well be served at a din- 
ner, especially if there are several hot entrees. To prepare 
this entree, some large sweetbreads, blanched or cooled 
under press, then cut in two; the two parts are then well 
trimmed, seasoned, floured, dipped in beaten eggs, bread 
crumbed, and fried in a saucepan with clarified butter; they 
must be of a nice color. Just before serving, the scol- 
lops are dished in a circular order, on a coat of forcemeat, 
poached on a dish, the cavity of the circle is garnished with 
green peas, plain boiled after the English fashion, well 
drained and well shaken together, off the fire, with a pat of 



Artistic Cookery 211 

fine butter. The sweetbreads, and the bottom of the dish, 
are mashed with a Colbert sauce, the remainder of which is 
served in a sauce boat. 

Lambs' Brains a L'ltalienne. This is a meat entree 
which is often served in France, Italy, and England. These 
entrees must always be dished with a certain elegance; if 
not, they sink into the order of common entrees. To pre- 
pare this entree, some large and beautiful lamb's brains must 
be chosen, and the skin removed without affecting their 
shape; when well cleaned and blanched, they are cooked in 
a good stock with wine. 

The entree is dished up on a patd-chaud case, well 
pinched, and baked to a nice color; but its interior is filled 
with common force-meat; the force meat is poached in the 
stove, or at the entrance of the oven. The brains are dished 
in a circular order, on the border of the crust, placing alter- 
nately between them a pretty crouton of pickled tongue, cut 
in the shape of a cock's-comb; the cavity of the circle 
is garnished with a puree of artichoke bottoms; over this 
puree is poured a little melted glaze, the croutons are also 
glazed, the brains are mashed with a little good veloute 
sauce, the remainder is served in a sauce boat. 

Filet of Beef a la Godard. This remove is one of 
the most elegant, which can be served at a sumptuous dinner; 
it can be placed on the table on a beautiful hot-water dish; 
but if carved, and the slices not too large, it can be presented 
to the guests. Two good small filets of beef, but not too fat, 
are neatly trimmed, larded, and braised in a good stock; 
when done, glazed, and of a nice color, they are carved in 
slices, that is to say, this carving stops at some distance 
from the extremities, and penetrates no further than three 
parts of the meat; the carved pieces are put back in their 
places. 

These filets are dished up on a bottom of cooked rice, cut 



2\2 Artistic Cookery 

in a long shape, and on an inclined plane on both sides. 
Between the two filets are dished three quenelles with pieces 
of truffles large enough to fill the empty space; under these 
quenelles, at the bottom of the dish, is ranged a beautiful 
ring of slices of sweetbreads, partly crumbed with bread and 
partly with truffles; they are done in clarified butter. Be- 
tween the quenelles, and the chain formed by the sweet- 
breads, are distributed groups of mushrooms; at both ends 
of the dish some fine, whole truffles surround the tops of the 
filets. This garnish is similarly repeated on the other side 
of the dish. Between the two filets, and in the center of the 
dish, a pretty garnished cup is fixed on the foundation; this 
cup may be of metal, masked with English or with nudel 
paste, and ornamented; it may also be made of bread, or 
even cut out of large turnips. With a little skill some very 
elegant cups can be made out of these turnips. With so rich 
and elegant a remove, a good light Espagnole sauce must be 
served, that is, not too thick, but juicy, beaten well and 
thinned with a good stock and some Madeira, as well as with 
the liquor of the truffles. This sauce is sent up separately. 

Saddle of Venison, Larded and Roasted. A 
saddle of venison, not too high, and well roasted, always 
makes a distinguished dish, even in countries abounding 
with this game. Nowhere is venison finer or of a more 
delicate flavor than in England; nowhere either is it more 
esteemed and sought after. However, in England the haunch 
of venison is more generally eaten, that is to say, the leg of 
the animal to which a part of the saddle adheres; but in 
Germany, in Russia, and even in France, the saddle of red 
deer or of fallow deer is very often served, and it is more 
often larded; for, the filets of venison are not always 
covered with fat. In order to eat vension in perfection, it 
must be mortified to a certain degree, for without this morti- 
fication the flesh will be found less delicate. 



Artistic Cookery — Plate No. 4

Saddle of Venison. Veal Nut. girloin of Beef, Ham Print 



Artistic Cookery 213 

If the buck be fat, the saddle should be cooked without 
being larded, and without removing the fat from the filets, 
as this fat is generally much esteemed; but if the filets are 
not covered with a thick coat of fat, the skin is removed, 
and the flesh larded with bacon. In such conditions the 
saddle may either be roasted on the spit, or baked in the 
oven. It must be basted with butter whilst cooking. A 
saddle of venison may be served with a piquant sauce, with 
poivrade or venison sauce, with gravy, or currant jelly; but 
it is often served with gravy in the dish, and some venison 
sauce can be served separately. When a saddle of venison 
is served carved, the filets should first be removed, then cut 
slanting, put back into their places, and glazed with a 
paste-brush. 

A Nice Large Noix of Veal is not one of the least 
estimable dishes, nor one of the least choice, if the meat is 
nice, fat, white, and delicate, cooked to the exact point, and 
well glazed. In England some salt meat is generally served 
with removes of veal. 

The noix represented in the plate is select, voluminous, 
and with all the tetine adhering to it. The meat is larded 
with bacon, the piece secured in an oval shape, with a string, 
cooked with little liquid, and nicely glazed; it is dished up 
on a foundation of cooked meat, cooled under a press, and 
glazed at the entrance of the oven; this foundation is neces- 
sary, to heighten the form and aspect of the piece. It is sur- 
rounded with groups of vegetables, cooked in water, or 
glazed; cauliflowers, carrots, green peas, French beans. 
Two skewers of vegetables are inserted in the meat on each 
side. The bottom of the dish is masked with good gravy, 
the dish itself placed on a hot-water dish. With this remove 
is served a brown sauce, slightly thickened, and worked with 
the residue, freed of the fat, of the noix of veal. 



214 Artistic Cookery 

A Fine Sirloin of Beef, the produce of a young ani- 
mal carefully fattened and just sufficiently developed, is a 
most captivating picture for a connoisseur; but the joint 
must have hung sufficiently long to have acquired the 
wished-for tenderness; and it is of the highest importance 
that it should be roasted on the spit, and attended to with 
the utmost care. Beef, even when taken from a young 
animal, is always tough, dry, and without aroma, if it has 
not hung the proper time. The most perfect beef may be- 
come dry and tasteless, by not observing the proper medium 
between its being too much over, or underdone. The sir- 
loin represented in the plate, is served on the Jilct mignon — 
optical exigencies alone have induced me to present it thus 
— but I have no intention of giving it as a rule. Every 
practitioner knows, that in England sirloins of beef intend- 
ed for great dinners, are always served with the large filet 
underneath. 

Ham a la Printaniere. A fine ham, properly cured, 
boiled with care, prettily ornamented, and trimmed 
with a nice sauce, is certainly a most excellent re- 
move. If a ham is not sufficiently dissalted, it is 
placed in a kettle, and covered with cold water: the 
kettle is set over the fire, where it remains till the 
water boils. When this takes place, the ham is drained, then 
placed back into the kettle, moistened with wine and water, 
set on the fire, and garnished with a few big vegetables. At 
the first boiling of the liquid the kettle is removed 
to the side of the fire thus letting the liquid only 
simmer gently for three hours, and even longer, if the 
ham is large; the kettle must be taken away from the fire; 
half an hour afterward the ham is drained, and trimmed. 

The ham shown in the drawing is placed on a hot-water- 
dish: it is cut flat underneath, so that it lies well on the 
dish; it is then surrounded with small timbales of spinach 



Artistic Cookery 215 

and potatoes, poached in a "bainmarie;" the bottom of the 
dish is masked with a little "Espagnole" sauce, worked with 
Madeira wine, and kept light. The ham is glazed with a 
paste-brush; the remainder of the sauce is sent up in a sauce 
boat, and served at the same time with a dish of green peas. 

POULTRY 

See Plate No. 6 

Turkey "a 1' Imperiale." A nice, fat white hen turkey 
is trussed, singed, its breast and legs larded. It is then placed 
in zbraisicre pan, cooked with a good stock, and glazed to a 
pretty color. When about to be served, the turkey is drained, 
divested of the string, and placed on a long dish, and made 
to lean against a foundation of force meat. Two small 
croustades of bread, or rice, carved with a knife, are stuck on 
each end of the dish, garnished with "montglas" of poultry, 
encircled with small truffles. The turkey is then surrounded, 
on both sides, with a garnish composed of cocks' combs 
and button-mushrooms, piled up in groups. These mush- 
rooms and cocks' combs may be masked with a little "Alle- 
mande" sauce, and the truffles glazed with a paste brush. 
Two boatfuls of "Espagnole" sauce, worked with the gravy 
of the turkey, are served at the same time. This piece is 
dressed, to appear on the table, on a hot-water-dish; 
if the turkey has been previously carved, the dish may 
be handed round to the guests. 

Roasted Capons, with Water Cresses. A nice, 
fat, tender capon constitutes a roast so highly distinguished, 
as to be neither common nor easy to be found everywhere. 
Capons should above all be young: it would be of little use 
to have them well fattened, if they were tough. 

Roasted capons are never larded: they are covered with 
bacon, or wrapped in buttered paper, until three parts 



216 Artistic Cookery 

roasted. The spit is the only method applicable to the 
cooking of roasted capons: if the flesh be basted with good 
butter, it becomes unctuous and succulent. 

The carving of capons is very simple. The legs are first 
slipped off, and divided into two parts. Two small filets, 
with the pinion of the wing adhering, are taken off the 
breast; a nice slice is then cut on each side of the breast, 
and this is divided either lengthwise or transversely. Some 
nice gravy and bread sauce must be served with roasted 
capons. If the gravy is sent up separately, the capons when 
dished up may be garnished with water cresses. The capons 
may be filled with truffles. 

Larded and Roasted Turkey, with Truffles. A fat 

and very tender turkey is an excellent roast; larded, or 
covered with bacon, it is always welcomed; the best way to 
roast a turkey is ou the spit. It should be previously wrapped 
in buttered paper, and basted with butter while cooking. 
One hour and a half, to two hours, is required to roast a 
turkey on the spit; the fire should be moderate and continual. 
When it is three parts done, the paper is taken off, so as 
to facilitate the coloring of the surface. There are two ways 
of serving roasted turkey, with truffles; the first one consists 
in filling the turkey with peeled and seasoned truffles; these 
may be whole or cut up, they are mixed up with rasped bacon. 
The second consists in filling the turkey simply with rasped 
bacon mixed with the raw peel of the truffles; previously 
chopped up; in this case the peeled truffles are cooked at 
the time in a little good wine, then the liquor is reduced 
with good gravy. At the moment the roast is dished, the 
truffles are piled round the turkey, and the gravy sent up in 
a boat. The leg bones of a roasted turkey should be. cut up 
short, and a truffle put thereto. The carving of the turkey 
is very simple; it suffices to slip off entirely the two filets 
of the breast, to cut them in slices and to put them back in 



Artistic Cookery — Plate No. 6

their places. At a select dinner, the legs of a roasted turkey 
should never be carved or served at all. 

Roasted Partridges. Partridges for roasting should be 
young, this is the first point. They do not require to be kept 
long before cooking; they may be stuffed with raw, peeled, 
and seasoned truffles; truffled partridges constitute a very 
distinguished roast. They should be trussed with two strings, 
and may be larded or covered with bacon; they should, in 
preference, be roasted on the spit; twelve minutes suffice to 
roast tender partridges, if the fire is kept alive. While they 
are being cooked, they should be frequently basted with 
butter. Partridges, like nearly all game roasts, should be 
kept underdone. 

When the partidges are taken off the spit, and freed of the 
strings, they are either dished up whole, or carved, accord- 
ing as they are served on the table, or handed. round to the 
guests. The carving of the partridges is done in several 
ways. The most elegant consists in slipping off the breast 
from the back part, to cut it up in three parts, and put it in 
form and in its place again. The partridges may also be 
divided into three parts, by cutting off at once a filet and a 
leg, so as to leave the breast part adhering to the backbone; 
this is afterward done away with, and the partridge is formed 
again. With roasted partridges, some good gravy, bread 
sauce, water cresses, or simply some lemons in quarters, may 
be served. If the partridges are garnished with water cresses 
the gravy must be sent up in a boat: with game roasts, only 
a little gravy is required, but this should be limpid and 
succulent. 

VEGETABLES 

See Plate No. 5 

Boiled Asparagus. White or violet asparagus is one of 
the most distinguished and delicate of vegetables. Large 
sized asparagus is certainly the most highly valued, but 



218 Artistic Cookery 

only of a good sort, freshly gathered, and properly cooked. 

Previous to cooking asparagus, they must be plucked, 
scraped, and cut to equal lengths; then selected and arranged 
according to their different sizes: taking the middle-sized, 
small, and large ones separately. Then they are tied closely 
together with thread, or narrow strips of ribbon, plunged 
into boiling water at a few minutes' interval, the largest 
first, in order that the bundles all may be done at the same 
time. The water, in whieh the asparagus are boiled, must 
be highly salted. 

The right moment for the cooking of asparagus is a con- 
sideration on no account to be overlooked; as, if asparagus 
is too hard, it becomes unpalatable; and if too soft, it loses 
all its good qualities. In short, it is not well done, if when 
held by the thick end in a horizontal position between the 
fingers, it does not bend lightly,, but falls heavily down. If 
the flavor of asparagus is to be well appreciated, it must be 
eaten immediately when boiled. As soon as the asparagus 
are well drained they are dished in a pyramid on a folded 
napkin. Boiled asparagus are generally served with Dutch 
sauce, cream sauce or sauce with bread crumbs fried in butter. 

Fried Salsify, or Oyster-Plant. Although a very 
common vegetable, yet it is to be served at every family 
dinner. Previous to frying the salsify, they must be scraped 
and boiled in white stock. When drained and cooled, they 
are cut to equal lengths (about 2 inches), placed in a dish, 
and left to macerate ; that is, seasoned with salt and pepper, 
moistened with oil and lemon juice. A few minutes previous 
to serving, the salsifies are drained, slightly floured, dipped 
into a light frying paste, and immediately plunged into very 
hot fat. But a small quantity must be cooked at a time, 
lest they should not all of them get a nice color. As soon as 
removed from the fat, and well drained, they are sprinkled 
with a little salt, and dished in two parallel groups on a 
neatly folded napkin, thus to be served without delay. 



Artistic Cookery 219 

Artichokes, with Dutch Sauce. The artichokes, 
intended to be boiled, .must be selected from the largest 
sort; the young ones being not so well adapted for this 
method of cooking. Previous to being boiled, the artichoke 
bottoms must be trimmed, and rubbed with lemon juice; the 
leaves shortened by cutting them straight on the side oppo- 
site the bottom. They are plunged, one by one, into cold 
water, slightly acidulated, either with citric acid, or with 
lemon juice. Then the artichokes are plunged into acidul- 
ous boiling water, and left thus to boil on a moderate fire, 
while the stewpan is kept covered. They are taken out of 
their cooking stock, by the aid of a skimmer, as soon as the 
hay (the center part of the artichoke) falls off, when touched 
and pushed with the fingers. When emptied, and well cleaned, 
they are put back into their own cooking-stock, and kept 
thus a few minutes, previous to being served. They are 
then well drained, and dished in a pyramid on a folded nap- 
kin. Artichokes generally are accompanied by Dutch sauce 
or melted butter; in either case, this sauce must be served 
separately. 

Farced Mushrooms. Mushrooms of couche, or comestible 
mushrooms, and the cepes, can be served farced, if they are 
large, and of an equal shape. Of whatever sort the mush- 
rooms intended to be farced may be, they must always be 
chosen fresh, trimmed, but not turned, emptied and seasoned. 
The force meat which the mushrooms are farced with, is 
generally composed of minced mushrooms, and sweet herbs 
reduced with butter or oil, mixed up with bread crumbs, and 
thickened with raw eggs; this mince, however, may be 
replaced by a quenelle force meat mixed with cooked sweet 
herbs. As soon as the mushrooms are farced, they are bread 
crumbed, placed in a stewpan, or on a baking sheet, then 
moistened with melted butter or oil, and baked in the oven. 
This done, they are dished in a pyramid on a folded napkin. 



220 Artistic Cookery 

Green Peas, with "Croutons." Green peas, and 
asparagus, these are the vegetables preferred by the gourmets 
of all countries. To green peas of truly fine quality all kinds 
of preparation may be applied; all of them will succeed. The 
French species, those sweet, fine, slightly perfumed green 
peas, are spread all over the world. In the middle of Russia, 
in Moskau, at Kiev, at Odessa; as well as in Algiers, Spain, 
Germany, Italy, and all over America, everywhere we have 
found green peas. 

For the preparation of green peas a la Francaise, they must 
be selected very fine, young, tender, and freshly gathered. 
In summer, green peas are soon affected by heat, and thus 
sometimes lose their best qualities in the lapse of but a few 
hours, if kept in a place shut up from the contact of the air. 
They are mixed with a little good butter and cold water 
boiled, with a sprig of parsley, a whole little onion, 
a little salt, a pinch of sugar; and are thickened, at 
the last moment, with butter mixed with flour. But, 
to make them delicate and savory, they must be 
cooked with moderation, and at the last moment be 
copiously enriched with good butter. The only garnish 
agreeing with green peas, is of course the most simple one, 
bread crotitons fried in butter and glazed. 

Spinach, with Eggs Boiled Soft. Spinach, although 
a vegetable common to all countries, is nevertheless highly 
appreciated, and well deserves to be so. The spinach, rep- 
resented by the drawing, is prepared with butter, thickened 
and garnished alternately with eggs boiled soft, and bread 
croutons, cut in a crescent shape, fried in butter, and glazed 
with the paste-brush. But few cooks prepare spinach well; 
and yet there is nothing simpler than the cooking of this 
vegetable. If prepared with cream or gravy, the spinach 
previously must be blanched, but in plenty of liquid, and on 
a very brisk fire; thus it preserves its nice color without

however boiling too long. When well drained, the water 
careful ly pressed out, it is chopped, and plunged' into hot 
melted butter, cooked a la noisette-; which means, giving it a 
fine hazel, light brown color. The dampness of the vege- 
table having dispersed, it is seasoned, and thickened with 
reduced good Bechamel sauce. The sauce. may be short, and 
yet the spinach be reduced again, for a few minutes only, 
with the sauce. Then the spinach is removed from the fire, 
and finished with a piece of good butter. 

If the spinach is prepared with gravy, it is slightly floured, 
after being well warmed in the hazel butter; or else it is thick- 
ened with a brown sauce well reduced, and is boiled for a 
few minutes more, to take consistence by being mixed with 
a little succulent gravy, or rather some good half-glaze; at 
the last moment, it is finished with a piece of good butter. 

Cauliflower, with Dutch Sauce. Previous to cook- 
ing cauliflowers, they are divided, trimmed if large; then 
they are boiled, either in salt water or steam, well drained 
and arranged in a dome-like fashion on a folded napkin. 
To give this dome a more regular shape, the cauliflowers 
can be placed beforehand in a dome-mould, and then turned 
out on the napkin. 

Cauliflowers generally are accompanied with either Dutch 
sauce, or butter sauce, or even with a good cream sauce. In 
Germany cauliflower is served with the same sauce that is 
applied to asparagus ;*some bread crumbs fried in butter. For 
the preparation of this sauce, half a pound of good butter is 
melted; when warm, two handfuls of grated white bread 
crumbs are added to it, and a little salt. The preparation 
is boiled, and for three minutes stirred continually; then the 
stewpan is removed onto a moderate fire. Five minutes 
afterward, the sauce may be served. 

Asparagus Heads, a La Duchesse. In this case, 
the asparagus are selected of equal length, scraped at the 



222 Artistic Cookery 

lower ends; then from the tender part, pieces one to one 
and one-half inches long are cut off. The asparagus is boiled 
in salt water or steam on a brisk fire, and done to the mo- 
ment. When well drained, they are placed in a flat stew- 
pan, with good butter, then seasoned, and moistened with a 
little good sauce, such as Bechamel. Then they are taken 
off the fire, and bound with a preparation of a few yolks of 
eggs, finished with a piece of butter. When dished up, 
they are surrounded with a garnish of Brussels sprouts, baked 
without sugar; which, when taken out of the oven, have to 
be sprinkled with a little Parmesan. 

Truffles in Napkin (a La Serviette). This is a 
dish, simple as well as rich, one of those producing the high- 
est effect imaginable. However indifferent a man may be 
to the charms of gastronomy; yet the beautiful appearance, 
as well as the fine perfume, of a dish of truffles, will always 
rouse his imagination. 

Truffles must be selected fresh, perfumed and aromatic, 
but above all of good origin. Those of Perigord are the 
most valuable, as no other part of the world produces finer 
or better. It is a pity, they are so very scarce; and that 
not everybody is able to distinguish the genuine species 
from those that are brought to market; which for the most 
part are gathered very far indeed from that land so richly 
favored. 

If truffles are to be served whole, it is a matter of course, 
that the finest, and largest must be chosen. When well 
brushed, well cleaned (not peeled), they are placed in a 
stewpan, moistened to half their height with good stock with 
white wine, Madeira, or Champagne; the choice of one of 
these sorts being merely a matter of taste. The great point 
is to cook the truffles at the moment of serving; the stewpan 
must be kept covered, and shut hermetically, so that they be 
cooked judiciously; that is, they must have time enough to 



Artistic Cookery 223 

be just penetrated, without getting dry. The inner pulp of 
the truffle must be tender, soft, and aromatic; if cooked 
too long, all these fine qualities are lost. The largest truffles 
will take eight or nine minutes; for middle-sized, seven 
minutes will do. Truffles cooked to excess not only lose 
their good qualities, but are apt to shrivel up, and get out of 
shape. 

The truffles represented in the drawing are dished in the 
hollow of a folded napkin. The following is the mode of 
proceeding: 

A fine damask napkin is spread entirely unfolded over a 
large table, thus forming an exact square. The four corners 
are taken up, folded over, and brought together in the mid- 
dle; this proceeding is repeated three times more; then the 
left hand first is laid on the center of the napkin, and with 
the right hand the edges are folded over, and kept straight 
upright; the napkin is placed on a dish, and its hollow filled 
with any mould at hand; which later is filled with the 
truffles. 

Cardoons with Marrow. Cardoons are a vegetable 
not produced in the Northern climates, not even in Germany. 
The best cardoons are those produced in Spain; those culti- 
vated in the South of France, however, and in Italy, are also 
superior qualities. They are also grown in the United 
States. 

Nowadays fresh as well as preserved cardoons are almost 
common, everywhere; i. e. in all gastronomic countries; they 
are the subjects of a large trade. If exported fresh in winter 
time, they may be preserved in the best condition for several 
days. If exported in boxes, preserved according to the 
methods applied to other preserved victuals, they will keep 
for years, without their qualities being injured in the least. 

The great point in the preparation of cardoons, the point 
never to be forgotten is, keeping them as white as possible 
in cooking, and cooking them without excess; as cardoons 



224 Artistic Cookery 

having cooked too long, lose a great deal of their fine flavor; 
yet neither dare they be kept too firm, because this would 
render them disagreeable to be eaten. 

Cardoons can be served, either with brown or yellow sauce; 
in either case this sauce must be succulent, well clarified, 
and not too liquid. 

If the cardoons are fresh, they ought to be divided into 
pieces of equal length, then blanched in water moderately 
acid, to get off the outer fibres. They must moderately soak 
in cold water, then be boiled in a white stock, mixed with 
some white wine, and some white broth from which the fat 
has not been skimmed; they are covered over with slices of 
bacon, so as to get very white indeed. When they are boiled 
and drained, they are cut into equal lengths, well sponged, 
dished in a pyramid on a silver vegetable dish, with a 
good espagnole sauce poured over them. The vegetable 
dish is placed on a fiat dish, and surrounded with a chain of 
very small patties garnished with small bits of cooked 
marrow.

Crusts with Cherries. These crusts are made with 
brioche paste, which has been prepared the day before; it is 
then cut into slices of an equal shape and thickness, 
sprinkled with pounded almonds and sugar, and glazed in 
the oven. The centerpiece may be either of punch cake, 
or simply of bread. If required, it may also be of tin, 
masked with office paste (raw paste). If of eatable paste, it 
must be coated with a layer of reduced apricot marmalade, 
with the aid of a pastebrush; if of bread, it is fried; if 
masked with raw paste, it is sufficient to give it a nice 
golden color, and let it dry in the air, previous to setting it 
on the dish. When about to be served, the cup is garnished

with either fresh or preserved cooked cherries; its base is 
surrounded with the crusts, being very hot and dished up in 
pyramids. The bottom of the dish is then slightly masked 
with a little good Madeira sauce, smoothed with some 
apricot marmalade. The remainder of this sauce is sent up 
in a sauceboat, after having introduced into it some pre- 
served cooked cherries. 

Bombe, a La Napolitaine. This bombe is moulded 
in a spherical tin mould, opening in three pieces, and clos- 
ing with hinges, but having on the top-center an aperture. 
The mould is previously spun and cooled, open, on salted 
ice; then the sides are masked with a layer, half an inch 
thick, of well-set chocolate ice; as soon as the mould is 
shut up, the hollow is filled, through the top aperture, with 
a preparation of whipped cream a la vanille. The topmost 
opening is then closed hermetically, the mould wrapped in 
paper, sprinkled with salt and saltpetre, and covered again 
with a thick layer of ice, also salted. The mould should 
remain in the ice for two hours and a half. Some fresh ice 
must then be put over it, and the mould must be kept in the 
same state one hour and a half longer. 

When ready to serve, the mould is washed in cold water, 
and the bombe is dished up on a folded napkin; it is then 
surrounded at the base with a wreath of small cakes. The 
bombe is ornamented on the top with a tuft in white spun- 
sugar, pricked in the opening, in imitation of a flame. 

Plum Pudding, with Punch. This is an entremets 
of English origin, but known and served in all countries; 
the receipt I am about to give here, although not usually 
adopted in England, is nevertheless one producing the best 
results. The English plum pudding is generally too heavy 
and massive; the one I am about to describe, which is often 
served up even at the most sumptuous dinners, is lighter and 
of a fine flavor. 

15 



226 Artistic Cookery 

The composition of plum pudding is: One pound of 
chopped beef kidney-suet, a pound and a quarter of grated 
fresh bread crumb, one pound of mixed dried raisins, half a 
pound of orange peel and citronate, a pound of moist sugar, 
a tablespoonful of powdered ginger, eight whole eggs, three- 
quarters of a glass of brandy, and half a glassful of good 
raw cream. 

The different ingredients are mixed and well worked, then 
put into a buttered and floured dome mould, covered with a 
napkin, likewise buttered and floured; this napkin is tied 
together on the other side of the mould, which is then 
plunged into boiling water. 

The pudding requires to be cooked for four hours, the 
kettle being closed, and without letting the water cease to 
boil. As soon as the pudding is drained, it is turned out of 
the cloth upon a hot dish, then a little cavity is formed on 
its center, to pour into it a few tablespoonfuls of very good 
brandy, previously mixed with a little sugar, then warmed 
and ignited. Plum pudding must be served and eaten while 
very hot. 

Basket of Fruit for Center-Piece. In the center 
of a table laid for dinner, it is usual to place some orna- 
mental piece, such as a surtout or a dormant, a candelabrum, 
or some stand in silver, bronze, or china. This centerpiece 
however, is nothing more than an accessory, which may easily 
be replaced by a simple vase of flowers, or a "corbeille" of fruit. 
The more handsome the dinner-service, the more elegant 
and rich, both in material and workmanship, must be the 
centerpiece. 

A "corbeille" of fruit, rich, abundant, and varied in its 
selection, is in fact only a centerpiece, when placed in the 
middle of the table. The "corbeille" itself may be in rustic 
work, osier, china, or metal. To prevent any chance of the 
fruit falling from its position, a piece of cardboard, in the 



Artistic Cookery 227 

form of a pyramid, surrounded and garnished with moss, 
should be made for the fruit to lean against. 

When arranging a "corbeille" of fruit for a dinner table, 
only the freshest, the rarest, and the most beautiful kinds 
should be selected. The sort and color to be chosen, must 
of course depend on the season; but as great a variety, and 
as diversified in tint, as is possible. If the fruit be large, 
as pears, apples, or pineapples, they must be removed from 
the "corbeille," to be cut up and handed round in plates. 
Pineapples are peeled and sliced, large pears are quartered 
without being peeled. 

Pewter Fruit-Moulds, Imitating Pineapples, 
Small Melons, Pears, Peaches, Etc., are known to 
everybody; it is necessary that each species of mould 
should be filled with ices varied in their nature and 
color. When the moulds are filled up, they are well closed, 
wrapped each in a piece of paper, set afterward on a thick 
layer of pounded ice, strongly salted and saltpetered; they 
are sprinkled with salt, and covered over with a thick layer 
of salted and saltpetred ice. One hour later, the moulds 
must be sufficiently frozen; they are freed of the paper, 
dipped in cold water, then the fruit ices are taken out of the 
mould, piled up symmetrically on the stand, round a small 
pyramid, in plain ice, either moulded or cut out, on which 
is placed the pineapple. The fruits are intermingled with 
natural green leaves. The tuft of the pineapple is imitated 
with angelica. 

Pineapple "a La Creole." Although in itself very 
simple, this dish is nevertheless very elegant and attractive; if 
the fruit be well imitated, the slices of pineapple fine, this 
dish is sure to meet with applause. It is necessary to have 
a pineapple mould, in which good rice a la crime, finished 
with a few yolks of eggs, is moulded. As soon as the rice 
is cooked and firm in the requisite condition, it is turned out 



228 Artistic Cookery 

on a foundation of bread of the same dimension (having about 
two inches of thickness), and fried in butter. If no mould 
be handy, the rice can be raised with the hands on the fried 
foundation, which in this case, is set on a dish. The sur- 
faces of the rice are smoothed, then modeled by the aid of 
a little knife, so as to imitate the asperities of the pineapple. 
In each of the protruding parts is stuck a little bit of 
angelica. The rice is then masked with a paste-brush, with 
a coating of hot, reduced apricot marmalade, to give it a 
higher degree of brilliancy. The crown of the pineapple is 
imitated with cut up angelica; its base is surrounded with 
nice slices of fresh pineapple in compote, cut regularly, but not 
too thin. Above these slices a crown of pointed triangles of 
angelica is stuck into the rice. The bottom of the dish is 
slightly masked with apricot or marasquin sauce, the 
remainder of which is sent up in a sauceboat. 

Apricots, a " la Conde." The apricots being cut in 
two, they are peeled, and cooked with a little butter and 
sugar, or simply in some light syrup; they are kept firm. 
Then they are placed in a sauce pan, thickened with a 
little apricot marmalade, and dished in a dome on a layer 
of rice, spread so as to form a cavity on the bottom of a 
dish. 

The apricots are sprinkled with some chopped almonds, 
mixed with sugar and a little white of eggs, glazed with 
salamander, and at last surrounded with little rice croquettes, 
in the shape of a pear, fried, and rolled in powdered sugar, 
flavored with vanilla. A bit of angelica is stuck to the 
most pointed end of each of the croquettes; halves of apri- 
cot almonds are placed on the fruit. Some apricot syrup with 
maraschino is served in a sauce boat. 

Sultan Cake. This is composed of two cakes with 
vanilla, one baked in a dome-shaped mould, the other baked 
in a square tin, and then cut in the shape of a cushion, iced 
over with a rose-colored tint, decorated with white icing,

with the aid of a cornet. It is placed on a dish, surrounded 
with sweet jelly, minced; the tassels are imitated in spun- 
sugar. The second cake is glazed, emptied, filled with a 
bavaroise preparation with pistachios or strawberries; the 
center of the cushion is surrounded with a turban, imitated 
in fine white spun-sugar, garnished with small red beads. 
The two tufts (pompons) on the top and center, are also 
imitated in spun-sugar. This entremets well executed, has 
always a beautiful effect. 

The King's Meringues. These meringues are the tra- 
ditional and indispensable entremets of the family dinners of 
the Prussian court. For this reason they are called the 
king's meringues. They are made with a very fine merin- 
gue-paste, according to a process specially observed in the 
royal kitchens. 

The preparation for meringue is composed in the propor- 
tions of a pound of sugar to eight whites of eggs, and a 
pinch of salt. The king's meringues are small in size; each 
shell has on the central point a hollow, very difficult to pro- 
duce, but which characterizes them in a peculiar manner. 
They are moulded with the spoon. The mode of proceeding 
deserves to be studied with care. The preparation is taken, 
in equal portions, with a tablespoon; it is then rolled up 
against the sides of the basin. When the preparation is 
quite smooth, it is dropped onto a sheet of paper, while 
holding the spoon perpendicularly, and turning it from left 
to right, as soon as the preparation touches the paper; it is 
by so doing, that it falls in a round form, leaving a hollow 
on the central part. When the shells are all laid on the 
paper, they are sprinkled with icing sugar powder, and sifted 
through a piece of wool. The meringues are baked in the 
usual way, that is, on damp boards in a very moderate oven ; 
then they are allowed to dry completely in a hot closet, and 
then cooled. 



230 Artistic Cookery 

A quarter of an hour before serving them, the meringues 
arc garnished with whipped cream, flavored with sugar and 
vanilla. They are then piled up o\\ a sugar or gum-paste 
stand, light and low in shape, ornamented on the friesewith 
a nice wreath of oak leaves, imitated in gum-paste. 

Muscovite Jelly. It is composed of sweet jelly pre- 
pared with isinglass, juice of fresh pineapple mixed with 
lemon juice, filtered and mixed with a little champagne; the 
jelly is set in an entremets mould, embedded in common ice; 
it must be set, layer by layer; each o( which layers is inter- 
mingled with slices of raw pineapple. The jelly having 
set, the mould is /a ippc with salt, with its lid shut; it 
must be frappi for twenty-live or thirty minutes. 
At serving time, it is washed with cold water, then dipped 
into water not too warm, wiped, and turned out on a bord- 
ered bottom, masked with gum paste, or white paper. This 
Muscovite preparation must be slightly glued (that is, with 
but half the usual quantity) ; for if too much glued, the jelly 
would not be eatable, because the action of the salt hardens 
the glue. This entremets must be served, shortly after 
being turned out of the mould; because, when coming out of 
the mould, it bears quite a particular physiognomy. 

Charlotte Russe, with Pistachios. This charlotte 
is formed with biscuit; half of which is glazed white, half 
light green with pistachios. The biscuit is cut in a slant- 
ing direction, rising to the same height, and the same 
length, as the charlotte mould; against the sides of which 
the pieces of biscuit must be leaned, placing them one beside 
the other, and alternating the shades. The bottom of the 
mould is masked, first with a tlat of paper, then with around 
of plain biscuit. This mould is embedded in ice, an hour 
previous to serving; ten minutes afterward, it is filled with 
some bavaroise preparation; this preparation is composed 
with a puree of pistachios, diluted with plain syrup, per- 



Artistic Cookery 231 

fumed with orange flowers, and glued, slightly thickened on 
ice, by stirring it, then mixed with good whipped-cream — 
three glasses full; the cream must be mixed with the prepa- 
ration by degrees only. The preparation having got firm, 
the charlotte is turned out on a bottom of gum paste, the 
top of which is simply bordered with a circle of white beads 
of icing sugar, squeezed through a cornet. The basis of the 
bottom may be garnished with jelly croutons, or chopped 
jelly. The top of the charlotte is masked with a layer of 
marmalade. The rim is surrounded with little glazed 
biscuit; the center of this circle being garnished with 
whipped cream, or chopped jelly. 

Suedoise of Fruits, with Jelly. This dish is 
formed in a high shaped charlotte mould; this mould is first 
embedded in ice, then garnished along its sides, with little 
balls of white apples and reddened pears, which must be 
moderately boiled in light syrup. First they are left to cool 
well on ice, then they are pricked with a larding needle, 
and dipped in white, half-set jelly; then they are set against 
the sides of the mould, alternating the shades by two and 
two, thus forming diagonal stripes. 

As soon as the fruits are raised, they are supported by a 
coating of orange jelly, one-eighth of an inch thick, 
applied on the bottom, and all round; the hollow is then 
filled by a pineapple bavaroise preparation with pistachios or 
strawberries, mixed up with a salpicon of preserved fruits. 
The preparation must be kept on ice for an hour. At serv- 
ing time, the mould is quickly dipped in warm water, and 
the entremets turned out on a bordered bottom of gum 
paste. The top of the suedoise is then decorated with a 
fine rosace of preserved fruits or of jelly, the center of which 
is garnished with a fine green gage. The bottom of the 
dish may be also garnished ".:th chopped jelly, or with 
jelly croutons. 



232 Artistic Cookery 

Blancmanger Rubane. For this dish, first of all, 
there must be prepared some almond milk, with enough of 
extract, and sufficient in itself to fill a mould with cylinder 
and channelings; it must be well glued and sweetened, 
passed through a sieve, and divided into three parts; one of 
which, having some pounded almonds mixed with a little 
spinach green infused, is then passed through a tammy; the 
second part into which is infused the peel of a good orange, 
is then slightly colored with vegetable red, and likewise 
passed; whilst the third and last part, with a stock of vanilla 
infused, is kept in its natural shade and passed likewise. 
An oiled channeled mould is embedded in ice; a layer of the 
green preparation, one centimeter and a half thick, is 
poured on the bottom of it; as soon as this layer has got 
firm, another layer of the same thickness of white prepara- 
tion, -is poured on; when it has set, it is covered with a 
third layer, always of the same thickness, of red prepara- 
tion , which is left to get firm; then the same operation is 
begun anew. Optical motives have induced me to take only 
two colors. 

An hour afterward, that is to say at serving time, the 
mould is dipped in hot water, wiped, and turned out on a 
bottom of bordered gum paste, bearing a little stem on its 
center. The base of the bottom of gum paste may be 
surrounded with croutons of sweet jelly; the top of the stem 
is decorated with a pompon of spun sugar. 

Note: A few of the cooking utensils mentioned in this Chapter although 
in constant use in Europe have become obsolete in this country, in most 
households; but are still in use in America, in hotels and the kitchens of the 
very rich. .

THE CARE OF THE PERSON 



The employment of baths goes back to the highest 
antiquity, and was indulged in almost to excess by the Greeks 
and Romans. So important are baths in warm countries, 
that the Jewish and Oriental religions enjoin frequent ablut- 
ions as necessary part of the ceremonials of their creeds, 
thus no doubt largely contributing to the health and well- 
being of their devout disciples. 

In order to understand 
the value of bathing, we 
must glance briefly at the 
anatomy and physiology 
of the skin. In the first 
place we have on the en- 
tire outer surface of the 
body, a layer of mem- 

The Toilet Case. brane > like thin leather, 

called the epidermis; this stratum is not supplied with 
nerves, is therefore insensible, and constitutes the portion 
which rises up when the hands are blistered by rowing, for 
example, or when a fly blister is applied. 

Just beneath the epidermis lies the true skin, or corium 
as it is called, a tough, strong membrane, richly supplied 
with bloodvessels and nerves. Hence it bleeds and feels 
pain at the slightest cut or puncture, since even the finest 
needle cannot be thrust into it without wounding some little 
artery or vein, and some tiny filament of nerve. Under the 
true skin again lies the subcutaneous cellular tissue, which 
generally contains a good deal of fat. 

235 




236 The Care of the Person 

The most important constituents of the skin to our present 
inquiry, however, are: 1st, the sweat glands; 2d, the oil 
glands; 3d, the hair and nails, usually spoken of as ap- 
pendages to the skin. 

The sweat glands are twisted and coiled-up tubes, occupy- 
ing the true skin and the layer of tissue beneath. They 
open upon the outside of the epidermis by an immense num- 
ber of minute openings called pores, almost invisible to the 
naked eye. When we are at rest, the flow of the perspirat- 
ion though constant, is seldom so free that it does not 
evaporate almost as rapidly as it exudes, so that the skin is 
only kept pleasantly moist; but during exercise, especially 
in warm weather, the cutaneous surface becomes covered 
with drops of fluid. 

When the pores of the skin are partly choked up, so that 
they cannot do their work properly, some of this duty of 
purifying and regulating the volume of the blood is thrown 
upon certain internal organs, such as the kidneys or intest- 
ines; and should these happen to be weak, diseased, or 
already overtasked, serious disturbance may be quickly 
brought on throughout the whole system. 

Warm Baths. For purposes of cleanliness, the baths 
par excellence are those of warm water, this term being ap- 
plied to those in which water of a temperature from 70 to 
8o° is employed. 

Liquids of this degree of heat usually give a sensation of 
warmth when placed in contact with the human skin, and 
therefore avoid the disadvantage of the shock to our systems 
produced by a cold bath (that is, below 6o°), and the exces- 
sive stimulation resulting from a hot bath, i. e., one of 85° 
and upward. Soap, or alkali in some form, is necessary to 
remove the fatty matter poured out by the oil glands already 
described, and for most people there is nothing better than 
the old-fashioned white castile. Many persons are apt to 



The Care of the Person 237 

remain too long in a warm bath, and care should be taken 
to avoid this mistake, which has a very debilitating effect 
if often indulged in. 

The frequency with which a bath should be repeated 
varies somewhat with different individuals. A safe rule, to 
which of course there are sundry exceptions, would be to 
bathe the body twice a week in winter and every other day 
in summer, gradually increasing the frequency to a tri- 
weekly washing in winter and a daily one in summer, if ex- 
perience proves that better health is secured by such a 
habit. It is very important to avoid being exposed to cool 
air after immersion in a warm bath. 

A Good Bath for Persons Suffering from 
Debility. Take a quart of cheap whiskey and put into it a 
teacupful of rock salt; dip a crash towel in this and let it 
dry; then wet the body all over with the salt and whiskey, 
and rub dry with the towel. The rubbing should be done 
with short, light strokes, and toward the heart; that is, the 
limbs should be rubbed up and the face, neck and upper part 
of the chest down. This bath relieves congestion and facili- 
tates circulation by bringing the blood to the surface of the 
body. Add to the mixture 1 tablespoonful camphor and Yz 
tablespoonful ammonia. 

Alcohol Sweat Bath. Procure a small alcohol lamp 
and after filling it with alcohol, light and place under an 
ordinary cane-seated chair on which several thicknesses of 
paper have been placed. Divest the person of all clothing 
and after being seated in the chair, wrap one or two large 
blankets around the person, chair and all. Be very care- 
ful to have the blankets reach well to the floor and to have no 
openings for the heat to escape. To facilitate perspiration 
wring a thick towel out of hot water and place on the head, 
and over that put a light woolen covering. After perspiring 
freely take a plunge bath in a tub of clear warm water. No 



238 The Care of the Person 

soap should be used. After bathing, rub the surface of the 
body thoroughly dry with a crash towel and retire for at 
least an hour or two. The best time to take this bath is at 
night, when one can remain undisturbed until morning. 
This bath will be found most beneficial when suffering from 
colds, or exhaustion caused by excessive mental or physical 
labor. 

Baths for Children should be given according to age 
and constitution. Some require warm baths, and cannot 
stand the effect of cold water, while with other children it 
agrees perfectly. A tepid bath is the one most generally 
suitable. Young children should have their bath in the 
morning, and if they are under two years may take it after 
their first meal. A child should never be given a hot bath 
in a very cold room, and thorough drying after bathing is of 
great importance. 

The Face. So much that is ill-advised has been writ- 
ten about the means of acquiring a beautiful complexion 
that it seems charitable to warn women against the numer- 
ous so-called skin beautifiers advertised by perfumers and 
druggists. In most cases these preparations are downright 
dangerous and bring on pimples, wrinkles and even serious 
troubles of the dermal tissues. The bleaching fluids destroy 
the epiderm and absorb the oily matter necessary for a 
healthy function of the skin, which soon becomes as dry 
and hard as parchment. The pomades fill up the pores and 
produce blackheads. Of a truth, many of the cosmetics, 
especially those prepared by conscientious chemists, are ab- 
solutely harmless; that is all that can be said of them, 
however, for in no way do they improve a complexion which 
is bad or indifferent by nature. 

Circassian women, who are noted for their velvety skins 
and hedge-rose bloom, never use ointments of any kind. 
They apply to their faces half an hour before their daily 



The Care of the Person 239 

bath, a thorough coating of white of egg. When this has 
completely dried they wash it off with tepid water, and then 
proceed to bathe as usual in soap and water. A spoonful of 
tincture of benzoin is added to the bath, pervading it with 
sweet and invigorating perfume. The white of egg cleanses 
the skin perfectly, freeing it from all impurities and obstruc- 
tions, and leaves it smooth and soft like that of a baby. 

Black Spots on the Face. The black spots on the 
face are not always what are called fleshworms. What are 
mistaken for them are produced in this way: The skin may 
be coarse, and the ducts, being large, collect the perspira- 
tion, which hardens and blackens, and hence the common 
supposition of their being grubs or maggots in the skin. 
The remedy is simple. Clean the part affected by squeezing 
out the substance that is lodged, and then use a lotion of 
diluted spirits of wine several times a day, until the blotches 
have disappeared. If they are really fleshworms, take 
something to purify your blood — sulphur or sarsaparilla. 

To Remove Sunburn and to Prevent the Skin 
from Cracking. Melt two ounces of spermaceti in a pip- 
kin, and add two ounces of oil of almonds. When they are 
well mixed and have begun to cool, st ; r in a tablespoonful 
of fine honey and continue to stir briskly until cool. Put in 
small jars. Apply it on going to bed, after washing the 
face, and allow it to remain on all night. 

It is said that strawberries rubbed over the face at night 
will remove freckles and sunburn. 

Pearl Water for the Complexion. Take castile 
soap, one pound; water, one gallon; dissolve. Then add 
alcohol, one quart; oil of rosemary and oil of lavender, of 
each, two drachms; mix well. 

Freckles No. 1. Take grated horseradish and put in 
very sour milk. Let it stand four hours, then wash the face 
night and morning. 



240 The Care of the Person 

Freckles No. 2. Rectified spirits of wine, one ounce; 
water, eight ounces; half an ounce of orange-flower water, 
or one ounce of rosewater; diluted muriatic acid, one tea- 
spoonful ; mix. To be used after washing. 

Freckles No. 3. Take one ounce lemon juice, one- 
fourth drachm of powdered borax, half drachm sugar. Mix 
and let them stand in a glass bottle for a few days. Then 
rub it on the face and hands night and morning. Two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice equal an ounce. 

Freckles No. 4. Take of sulpho carbolate of zinc, 2 
drachms; glycerine, 3 fluid ounces; alcohol, half a fluid oz. ; 
rose water, enough to make 8 fluid ounces. Apply locally. 

Wash for the Face. Wash the face at night with 
either sour milk or buttermilk, and in, the morning with 
weak bran tea and a little eau de cologne. This will soften 
the skin and remove the redness, and will also make it less 
liable to burn again with exposure to the sun. Bathing the 
face several times in the day with elder flower water and a 
few drops of eau de cologne is very efficacious. 

Calamine Lotion. Take of levigated calamine (white) 
ten grains; oxide of zinc, twenty grains; glycerine, twenty 
drops; rosewater, one ounce. Apply to face. (A favorite 
prescription with ladies who have flushed faces.) 

Cure for Chapped Lips. Dissolve a lump of beeswax 
in a small quantity of sweet oil — over a candle — let it cool, 
and it will be ready for use. Rubbing it warm on the lips 
two or three times will effect a cure. 

Lip Salve. Melt a lump of sugar in one and a half 
tablespoonfuls of rosewater; mix it with two tablespoonfuls 
of sweet oil, a piece of spermaceti half as large as an 
English walnut; simmer the whole and turn it into boxes. 

The Hands. Soap is an indispensable article for 
cleansing hands, but it often leaves the skin rough; cracks 
oh the hands come, and soap is often unpleasant. Use 



The Care of the Person 24 1 

honey, rub it on when the skin is dry; moisten a little, rub 
• harder, use a little more water; finally wash thoroughly and 
your hands will be as clean as though the strongest soap 
were used, and no cracks or roughness will annoy you. 

To Soften the Hands. To soften the hands, fill a 
wash-basin half full of fine white sand and soapsuds as hot 
as can be borne. Wash the hands in this, five minutes at a 
time, washing and rubbing them in the sand. The best is 
the flint sand, or the white, powdered quartz sold for filters. 
It may be used repeatedly by pouring the water away after 
each washing, and adding fresh to keep it from blowing 
about. Rinse in warm lather of fine soap, and, after dry- 
ing, rub them with dry bran or cornmeal. Dust them, and 
finish with rubbing cold cream well into the skin. This 
effectually removes the roughness caused by housework, and 
should be used every day, first removing ink or vegetable 
stains with acid. 

To Soften the Hands, No. 2. Keep a dish of Indian 
meal on the toilet stand near the soap, and rub the meal 
freely on the hands after soaping them for washing. It will 
surprise you, if you have not tried it, to find how it will 
cleanse and soften the skin, and prevent chapping. 

To Soften the Hands, No. 3. Before retiring take a 
large pair of gloves and spread mutton tallow inside, also 
all over the hands. Wear the gloves all night, and wash 
the hands with olive oil and white castile soap the next 
morning. 

After cleansing the hands with soap, rub them well with 
oatmeal while still wet. Honey is also very good, used in 
the same way as lemon juice, well rubbed in at night. 

To Whiten the Hands. (1) Keep some oatmeal on 
the washstand, and, as often as the hands are washed, rub a 
little oatmeal over them; then rinse it off, and when dry, 
put on a little bit of pomade, made as follows: Take about 

16 



242 The Care of the Person 

five cents' worth each of white wax, spermaceti and pow- 
dered camphor and olive oil enough to make it the thickness 
of soap; put it in a gallipot, and let it stand in an oven to 
melt; mix it up, and when cold, it will be found very good 
for the hands. Gloves, worn- either in the day or night, 
will help to keep the hands white. 

(2) Half an ounce of white wax, half an ounce of sper- 
maceti, quarter of an ounce of powdered camphor. Mix 
them with as much olive oil as will form them into a very 
stiff paste, and use as often as you wash your hands. 

(3) Mixtures of two parts of glycerine, one part ammo- 
nia, and a little rosewater, whiten and soften -the hands. 

Almond Paste To Keep the Hands White and 
Soft. Beat four ounces of bitter almonds. Add to them 
three ounces of lemon juice, three ounces of almond oil, 
and enough of weak spirits of wine and ether to make a 
paste. Apply when retiring. 

The Nails. Great attention should be paid to keeping 
the nails in good order. They should be brushed at least 
twice a day, and the skin round the lower part should be 
kept down by rubbing with a soft towel. The sides of the 
nails need clipping about once a week. If they become 
stained, wash them well with soap; and after rinsing off 
the soap well, brush them with lemon juice. 

Cold Cream. This is a simple and cooling ointment, 
exceedingly serviceable for rough or chapped hands, or for 
keeping the skin soft. It is very easily made: Half an 
ounce of white wax, put into a small basin, with two ounces 
of almond oil ; when quite melted add two ounces rosewater. 
This must be done very slowly, little by little; and as you 
pour it in, beat the mixture smartly with a fork to make the 
water incorporate. When all is incorporated the cold cream 
is complete, and you may pour it into jars for future use. 



The Care of the Person 243 

The Teeth need brushing at least before going to bed 
every night, and are better for being cleansed after each 
meal. Tartar can be removed by using pumice stone reduced 
to powder, rubbing it on the teeth with a bit of soft wood 
made into a brush. Where the gums are sensitive, there is 
nothing better than the chalk and myrrh dentifrice. Where 
the top of a tooth is very sensitive, wet a bit of chalk and 
lay it on under the lip. Where the breath is offensive, the 
mouth should be rinsed with water in which an atom of 
permanganate of potash has been dissolved; just enough 
should be used to make the water pink. Take care not to 
swallow any, as it is a poison. Crooked teeth in children can 
often be straightened, without applying to a dentist, if the 
parents watch the teeth when coming through, and several 
times a day press the crooked one into position. Of course, 
where the arch of the mouth is defective, the upper teeth 
protruding over the under lip, or the under jaw projects, the 
services of a skillful dentist will be required. It is only 
after the permanent teeth arrive that such operations are 
performed. 

Tooth Powder. (1) Dissolve two ounces of borax in 
three pints of boiling water, and before it is cold, add 
one teaspoonful of the spirits of camphor, and bottle for use. 
A tablespoonful of this mixture, mixed with an equal 
quantity of tepid water, and applied daily with a soft brush, 
preserves and beautifies the teeth, extirpates all tartarous 
adhesion, arrests decay, induces healthy action of the gums, 
makes the teeth pearly white. 

(2) Ten cents' worth ground chalk, five cents' worth 
orris root, five cents' worth myrrh, one teaspoonful powdered 
castile soap. Mix all well together. 

(3) Prepared chalk, one pound; camphor, one or two 
drachms. The camphor must be finely powdered by moist- 
ening it with a little spirit of wine, and then intimately 
mixed with the chalk. 



244 The Care of the Person 

(4) Ingredients: Powdered charcoal, four ounces; powdered 
yellow bark, two ounces; powdered myrrh, one ounce; orris 
root, half an ounce. 

(5) A mixture of honey with the purest charcoal will 
prove an admirable cleanser. 

(6) A good way to clean teeth is to dip the brush in 
water, rub it over genuine white castile soap, then dip it in 
prepared chalk. A lady says : "I have been complimented 
upon the whiteness of my teeth, which were originally any- 
thing but white. I have used the soap constantly for 
two or three years, and the chalk for the last year. 
There is no danger of scratching the teeth, as the chalk is 
prepared, but with a good stiff brush and the soap is as 
effectual as soap and sand on a floor." 

Violet Mouth Wash. Tincture of orris, half pint; 
esprit de rose, half pint; spirit, half pint; otto of almonds, 
five drops. Shake thoroughly and rinse the mouth after 
eating. 

To Sweeten the Breath. From six to ten drops of 
the concentrated solution of chloride of soda in awineglass- 
ful of spring water, taken immediately after the ablutions of 
the morning are completed, will sweeten the breath by dis- 
infecting the stomach, which, far from being injured, will 
be benefited by the medicine. If necessary this may be 
repeated in the middle of the day. In some cases the odor 
from carious teeth is combined with that of the stomach. If 
the mouth is well rinsed with a teaspoonful of the chloride 
in a tumbler of water, the bad odor of the teeth will be 
removed. 

Care of the Hair. To keep the hair healthy, keep the 
head clean. Brush the scalp well with a stiff brush while 
dry. Then wash with castile soap, and rub into the roots 
bay rum, brandy, or camphor-water. If this is done twice a 
month, it will prove beneficial. Brush the scalp thoroughly 




The Care of the Person 245 

twice a week. Dampen the hair with soft water at the toilet, 
and do not use oil. 

Hair Wash. Take one ounce of borax, half ounce of 
camphor-powder — these ingredients fine — and dissolve them 
in one quart of boiling water. When cool, the solution will 
be ready for use; damp the hair frequently. This wash is 
said not only to cleanse and beautify, but to strengthen the 
hair, preserve the color and prevent baldness. 

Hair Wash. No. 2. The best wash we know for cleans- 
ing and softening the hair is an egg beaten up, and rubbed 
well into the hair, and afterward washed out with several 
washes of warm water. 

To Curl the Hair. There is no 
preparation which will make naturally 
straight hair assume a permanent curl. 
Hair Curler. The following will keep the hair in 

curl for a short time. Take borax, two ounces; gum arabic, 
one drachm; and hot water, not boiling, one quart; stir, 
and, as soon as the ingredients are dissolved, add three 
tablespoonfuls of strong spirits of camphor. On retiring to 
rest, wet the hair with the above liquid, and roll in twists 
of paper as usual. Do not disturb the hair until morning, 
when untwist and form into ringlets. 

Crimping the Hair. To make the hair stay in crimp, 
take five cents' worth of gum arabic, and add to it just 
enough boiling water to dissolve it. When dissolved, add 
enough alcohol to make it rather thin. Let this stand all 
night and then bottle it to prevent the alcohol from evaporat- 
ing. This put on the hair at night after it is done up in 
papers or pins, will make it stay in crimp the hottest day, and 
is perfectly harmless. 

Walnut Hair Dye. The simplest form is the pressed 
juice of the bark or shell of green walnut. To preserve this 
juice, little rectified spirit may be added to it, with a few 



246 The Care of the Person 

bruised cloves, and the whole digested together, with 
occasional agitation, for a week or fortnight, when the clear 
portion is decanted, and, if necessary, filtered. Sometimes 
only a little common salt is added to preserve the juice. It 
should be kept in a cool place. 

Hair Restorative. A good hair restorative may be 
made of boxwood leaves, of which take a handful and put 
into one pint of boiling water; digest for an hour, simmer 
ten minutes, and then strain. In applying it to the hair, 
rub it well into the roots. 

To Wash Brushes. Dissolve a piece of soda in some 

hot water, allowing a piece the 

^i'%. slze °f a wa l nut to a quart of 
water. Put the water into a 
basin, and after combing out the 
hair from the brushes, dip them, 
bristles downward, into the water 
and out again, keeping the backs 
and handles as free from the 
water as possible. Repeat this 
until the bristles look clean; then rinse the brushes in a 
little cold water; shake them well, and wipe the handles 
and backs with a towel, but not the bristles, and set the brushes 
to dry in the sun, or near the fire; but take care not to put 
them too close to it. Wiping the bristles of a brush makes 
them soft, as does also the use of soap. 

To Clean Combs. If it can be avoided', never wash 
combs, as the water often makes the teeth split, and the 
tortoise shell or horn of which they are made, rough. Small 
brushes, manufactured purposely for cleaning combs, may be 
purchased at a trifling cost ; with this the comb should be 
well brushed, and afterward wiped with a cloth or towel. 

To Clean Sponges. The following is a very simple 
and certain way of cleaning sponges from grease or any 




Home-made Perfumery 247 

other impurities: Take some soda and break it up. Measure 
about three tablespoonfuls; put it — as much as you can — 
into the holes of the sponge, and keep the rest. Then fill 
a large jug with boiling water and immediately put in your 
sponge and all your soda. Cover over and leave it standing 
for about twelve hours. After you rinse it well you will see 
the sponge look almost like a new one. 

HOME-MADE PERFUMERY 

Perfume for Handkerchiefs. Oil of lavender, three 
fluid drachms; oil of bergamot, three fluid drachms; extract 
of ambergris, six minims ; camphor, one grain ; spirits of wine, 
one pint. To be well shaken every day for a fortnight, and 
then filtered. 

Essence from Flowers. Procure a quantity of the 
petals of any flowers which have an agreeable fragrance; 
card thin layers of cotton, which dip into the finest Florence 
or Lucca oil; sprinkle a small quantity of fine salt on the 
flowers alternately until an earthen vessel or wide-mouthed 
glass bottle is full. Tie the top close with a bladder, then 
lay the vessel in a south aspect to the heat of the sun, and 
in fifteen days, when uncovered, a fragrant oil may be 
squeezed away, leaving a whole mass quite equal to the high- 
priced essences. 

Otto of Roses. Fill a large glazed earthen jar with 
rose leaves, carefully separated from the cups; pour upon 
them spring water, just sufficient to cover them, and set the 
jar with its contents in the sun for two or three days, taking 
it under cover at night. At the end of the third or fourth 
day, small particles of yellow oil will be seen floating on the 
surface of the water, and which, in the course of a week, 
will have increased to a thin scum. The scum is the otto of 
roses; take it up with a little cotton tied to the end of a 
stick, and squeeze it into a phial. 



248 Home-made Perfumery 

Violet Powder. Wheat starch, six parts by weight; 
orris root powder, two. Having reduced the starch to an 
impalpable powder, mix thoroughly with the orris root, and 
then perfume with otto of lemon, otto of bergamot and otto 
of cloves, using twice as much of the lemon as either of the 
other ottoes. 

Scent Powder. A good recipe for scent powder to be 
used for wardrobes, boxes, etc., far finer than any mixture 
sold at the shops, is the following: Coriander, orris root, 
rose leaves and aromatic calamus, each one ounce ; lavender 
flowers, ten ounces; rhodium, one-quarter drachm; musk, 
five grains. These are to be mixed and reduced to a coarse 
powder. This scents clothes as if fragrant flowers had been 
pressed in their folds. 

Almond Paste. Take of bleached almonds four ounces, 
add the white of one egg. Beat the almonds to a smooth 
paste in a mortar, then add the white of an egg and enough 
rosewater, mixed with its weight of spirits of wine, to give 
the proper consistence. This paste is used as a cosmetic to. 
beautify the complexion, and is also a remedy for chapped 
hands, etc. 

Shampooing Liquid. An excellent shampoo is made 
of salts of tartar, white castile soap, bay rum and lukewarm 
water. The salts will remove all dandruff; the soap will 
soften the hair and clean it thoroughly, and the bay rum will 
prevent taking cold. 

Toilet Soap. Take two pounds of pure beef tallow, two 
pounds of sal soda, one pound of salt, one ounce of gum 
camphor, one ounce of oil of bergamot, one ounce of borax. 
Boil slowly an hour, stir often, let it stand till cold. Then 
warm it over so it will run easily, and turn into cups or 
moulds clipped .in cold water. This is very nice for all toilet 
purposes, and is greatly improved by age.

THE CARE OF THE CLOTHES 

Hints for the Laundry. The laundress will find it 
useful to "paste this in her hat." 
Thirty yards of cotton cloth may be 
bleached in fifteen minutes by one 
large spoonful of sal soda and 
one pound of the chloride of lime 
dissolved in soft water; after taking 
out the cloth rinse it in soft cold 
water so that it may not rot. 
Wringer. The color of French linen maybe 

preserved by a bath of strong tea of common hay. Calicoes 
with pink or green colors will be brightened if vinegar is 
put in the rinsing water, while soda is used for purple and 
blue. If it is desired to set colors previous to washing, put 
a spoonful of ox gall to a gallon of water and soak 
the fabrics in the liquid. Colored napkins are put in lye 
before washing, to set the color. The color of black cloth 
is freshened if it is put in a pail of water containing a tea- 
cupful of lye. 

Washing Fluid. One pound of concentrated lye dis- 
solved in two gallons of hot soft water, and when nearly 
cold, add one ounce of sal ammonia and one ounce of 
tartar. 

Washing Fluid No. 2. Take one pound of sal soda, 
one-half pound of lime, and one gallon of water; boil one- 
half hour, skim, then set off to settle; pour off the clear 
fluid, put on more water and boil again, and so continue 
until you have a gallon of fluid. 

Hard Soap. Three pounds of grease, one pound of 
Babbit's potash, ten quarts of water, one-half pound of borax ; 

249 



250 The Care of the Clothes 

boil four or five hours, pour into a square wooden box, and 
when cold cut into blocks and set away to dry. 

Hard Soap No. 2. Five pounds of grease, one pound 
of concentrated potash and two quarts of water; put the 
potash into the water and when dissolved heat the grease 
and add to it; let it stand over night and in the morning 
add four quarts of water, and boil ; turn into moulds and 
when cold turn out and set aside to dry. 

Good Blueing. One ounce of Prussian blue, one-half 
ounce of oxalic acid; put in a quart jar and fill with boiling 
soft water. Let stand two or three days before using. 

To Glaze Linen. The gloss, or enamel, as it is some- 
times called, is 
produced mainly 
by friction with 
a warm iron, and 
may be put on 
linen by almost 
any person. The 

Irons. linen t0 be 

glazed receives as much strong starch as it is possible to 
charge it with, then it is dried. To each pound of starch a 
piece of sperm or white wax, about the size of a walnut, is 
usually added. When ready to be ironed, the linen is laid 
upon the table and moistened very lightly on the surface 
with a clean wet cloth. It is then ironed in the usual way 
with a flat-iron, and is ready for the glossing operation. 
For this purpose a peculiar heavy flat-iron, rounded at the 
bottom, as bright as a mirror, is used. It is pressed firmly 
upon the linen and rubbed with much force, and this fric- 
tional action puts on the gloss. "Elbow grease" is the 
principal secret connected with the art of glossing linen. 

To Remove Grease from Cloth. Take soap and 
Fuller's earth, of each half a pound; beat them well together 




The Care of the Clothes 251 

in a mortar, and form into cakes. The spot, first moistened 
with water, is rubbed with a cake and allowed to dry, when 
it is well rubbed with a little warm water and afterward 
rinsed or rubbed off clear. 

Wax Stains on Cloth. An old-fashioned way of 
removing wax stains from cloth is the following: Lay over the 
stains two thicknesses of blotting paper, and apply for a 
moment the pressure of a moderately hot iron. The wax 
becoming melted will be absorbed by the two layers of 
paper, and the stains will be instantaneously and entirely 
removed. 

Holes in Stockings. To mend large holes in stock- 
ings or merino underwear, tack a piece of net over the rent 
and darn through it. 

To Take out Spots and Stains from Dresses. To 

remove grease spots from cotton or woolen materials, absor- 
bent pastes, purified bullock's blood, and even common soap, 
are used, applied to the spot when dry. When the colors 
are not fast, use fullers' earth or pulverized potter's clay, laid 
in a layer over the spot, and press it with a very hot iron. For 
silks, moires, and plain or brocaded satins, begin by pouring 
over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine; cover it 
over with a linen cloth instantly. The spot 
will look tarnished, for a portion of the grease 
still remains; this will be removed entirely 
by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the 
spot, and a very little rubbing. If neatly done, 
no perceptible mark or circle will remain; 
nor will the luster of the richest silk be 
Box iron. changed, the union of the two liquids oper

logne will also remove grease from cloth and silk. Fruit- 
spots are removed from white and fast-colored cottons by 




252 The Care of the Clothes 

the use of chloride of soda. Commence by cold-soaping the 
article, then touch the spot with a hair pencil or feather 
dipped in the chloride, dipping it immediately into cold 
water, to prevent the texture of the article being injured. 
Ink spots are removed, when fresh applied to the spot, by a 
few drops of hot water being poured on immediately after- 
ward. By the same process, iron mold in linen or calico 
may be removed, dipping immediately in cold water to pre- 
vent injury to the fabric. Wax dropped on a shawl, table- 
cover, or cloth dress, is easily discharged by applying spirits 
of wine. Syrups or preserved fruits, by washing in luke- 
warm water with a dry cloth, and pressing the spot between 
two folds of clean linen. Essence of lemon will remove 
grease, but will make a spot itself in a few days. 

To "Wash Silk. The idea of washing silk dresses, and 
other articles of wearing apparel or furniture made of silk, 
will be novel to most of our readers. For a dress to be 
washed, the seams of a skirt do not require to be ripped 
apart, though it must be removed from the band at the 
waist, and the lining taken from the bottom. Trimmings 
or drapings, where there are deep folds, the bottom of which 
is very difficult to reach, should be undone so as to remain 
flat. A black silk dress, without being previously washed, 
may be refreshed by being soaked during twenty-four hours 
in soft, clear water; clearness in the water being indispen- 
sable. If dirty, the black dress may be previously washed. 
When very old and rusty, a pint of gin or whisky should 
be mixed with each gallon of water. This addition is an 
improvement under any circumstances, whether the silk be 
previously washed or not. After soaking, the dress should 
be hung up to drain dry without being wrung. The mode of 
washing silk is this: The article should be laid upon a 
clean, smooth table. A flannel should be well soaped, just 
made wet with lukewarm water, and the surface of the silk 



The Care of the Clothes 253 

rubbed oneway with it, care being taken that this rubbing 
is quite even. When the dirt has disappeared, the soap 
must be washed off with a sponge and plenty of cold water, 
of which the sponge must be made to imbibe as much as 
possible. As soon as one side is finished, the other must be 
washed precisely in the same manner. Let it be understood 
that not more of either surface must be done at a time than 
can be spread perfectly flat upon the table, and the hand can 
conveniently reach; likewise the soap must be quite sponged 
off one portion before the soaped flannel is applied to 
another portion. Silks, when washed, should always be 
dried in the shade, on a linen horse, and alone. If black or 
dark blue, they will be improved if, when dry, they are 
placed on a table and well sponged with gin or whisky, and 
again dried. Either of these spirits alone will remove, 
without washing, the dirt and grease from a black necktie or 
handkerchief of the same color, which will be so renovated 
by the application as to appear almost new. 

To Clean Ribbons. Ingredients. — y 2 pint of gin, y 2 
lb. of honey, V 2 lb. soft soap, 1-8 pint of water. 

Mode. — Mix the above ingredients together; then lay 
each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen 
table or dresser, and scrub it well on the 
soiled side with the mixture. Have ready 
three vessels of cold water; take each piece 
of silk at two corners, and dip it up and 
down in each vessel, but do not wring it; 
and take care that each breadth has one 
vessel of quite clean water for the last dip. 
Hang it up dripping for a minute or two, 
then dab it in a cloth, and iron it quickly 
with a very hot iron. 

Cleaning Cream. One-half pound of white castile 
soap, one-half pound of lump ammonia, two ounces of spirits 




The Lady's Maid. 



254 The Care of the Clothes 

of wine, two ounces of ether, cut the soap up fine and dis- 
solve in one quart of hot water, then take off the fire and 
add four quarts of cold water and the other ingredients. 
Bottle at once and cork tightly. This is for cleaning 
wearing apparel, taking out grease spots, etc. 

To Renovate Silk. Sponge faded silks with warm 
water and soap; then rub them with a dry cloth on a fiat 
board ; afterward iron them on the inside with a smoothing iron 
Old black silks may be improved by sponging with spirits. 
In this case, the ironing may be done on the right side, thin 
paper being spread over to prevent glazing. 

To Renew Velvet. Hold the velvet, pile downward, 
over boiling water, in which two pennyworth of stone 
ammonia is dissolved, double the velvet (pile inward) and 
fold it lightly together. 

To Clean Feathers. Cover the feathers with a paste 

made of pipe clay and 
water, rubbing them one 
way only. When quite 
dry, shake off all the 
powder, and curl with 
a knife. Grebe feathers 
Feather cleaning. may be washed with 

white soap in soft water. 

To Clean Cloth. You need dry fullers' earth moistened 
with lemon juice, and a small quantity of pulverized pearl- 
ash. Mix the fullers' earth and pearlash into balls with suffi- 
cient lemon juice to moisten. Scour the cloth with the balls. 

To Make Old Crape Look Nearly Equal to New. 

Place a little water in a tea kettle and let it boil until there 
is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape 
with both hands, pass it to and fro several times through the. 
steam, and it will be clean and look nearly equal to new. 





The Care of the Clothes 255 

Cleaning" Lace. To wash or clean fine linen or cotton 
lace, make a suds with warm water and 
some good white soap and add a few drops 
of ammonia or a little powdered borax. Put 
the lace in this and let stand for half an 
hour, then spat with the hand until the dirt 
is all removed. Be very careful not to rub 
as it destroys the texture. If very much 
soiled use two waters. When clean rinse twice, and in the 
last water put a little clear boiled starch, about a tablespoon- 
ful to two quarts of water. Then squeeze dry. Cover a 
round glass bottle with clean white cloth and over this wind 
the lace, using small pins to keep points or scallops in 
position, set away and when thoroughly dry unwind, taking 
out the pins carefully. If these instructions have been care- 
fully followed, the lace will look as good as new. 

How to Brush Clothes. Brushing clothes is a very 
simple but very necessary operation. Fine clothes require to 
be brushed lightly, and with rather a soft brush, except where 
mud is to be removed, when a hard one is necessary, being 
previously beaten lightly to dislodge the dirt. Lay the 
garment on a table, and brush it in the direction of the nap. 
Having brushed it properly turn the sleeves back to the 
collar, so that the folds may come at the elbow joints; next 
turn the lapels or sides back over the folded sleeves; then 
lay the skirts over level with the collar, so that the crease 
may fall about the center, and double one half over the 
other, so that the fold comes in the center of the back. 

How to Wash Flannels. There are many conflicting 
theories in regard to the proper way to wash flannels, but I 
am convinced, from careful observation, that the true way 
is to wash them in water in which you can comfortably bear 
your hand. Make suds before putting the flannels in, and 
do not rub soap on the flannel. I make it a rule to have only 
one piece of flannel put in the tub at a time. Wash in two 



256 The Care of the Clothes 

suds if much soiled; then rinse thoroughly in clean, weak 
suds, wring, and hang up; but do not take flannels out 
of warm water and hang out in a freezing air, as that cer- 
tainly tends to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the 
house, unless the sun shines. In washing worsted goods, 
such as men's pantaloons, pursue the same course, only do 
not wring them, but hang them up, and let them drain; while 
a little damp bring in and press smoothly with as hot an 
iron as you can use without scorching the goods. The reason 
for not wringing them is to prevent wrinkles. 

How to Clean Corsets. Take out the steels at front 
and sides, then scrub thoroughly with tepid or cold lather of 
white castile soap, using a very small scrubbing brush. Do 
not lay them in water. When quite clean let cold water run 
on them freely from the spigot to rinse out the soap 
thoroughly. Dry without ironing (after pulling lengthwise 
until they are straight and shapely) in a cool place. 

Boot Cleaning. Three good brushes and good blacking 
must be provided; one of the brushes hard, to brush off the 
mud; the other soft, to lay on the blacking; the third of a 
medium hardness, for polishing. The blacking should be 
kept corked up, except when in use, and applied to the 
brush with a sponge tied to a stick. When boots come in 
very muddy, wash off the mud, and wipe them dry with a 
sponge; then leave them to dry gradually on their sides, 
taking care they are not placed near the fire. 

To Clean Patent Leather Boots. They require to be 
wiped with a wet sponge, and afterward with a soft dry cloth, 
and occasionally with a soft cloth and sweet oil, blacking and 
polishing the edge of the soles in the usual way, but so as 
not to cover the patent polish with blacking. A little milk 
may also be used with very good effect for patent leather 
boots.

THE CARE OF THE HOUSE, FURNITURE. 
AND BRIC-A-BRAC. 

To Remove Stains from Boards. Take % lb. of 
fullers' earth and % lb. of pearlash; make them into a 
paste with about a quart of boiling water; spread a thick 
coating of this over the grease stains and leave it for ten or 
twelve hours; then wash it off with clean water, using sand 
if necessary. If the grease stains are very numerous and the 
floor very dirty, a coating may be spread all over the floor, 
and left for 24 hou/s before it is washed off. In washing 
boards never rub crossways, but always up and down with 
the grain. 

To Clean Floor Cloth. Shred half an ounce of good 
beeswax into a saucer, cover it entirely with 
turpentine, and place it in the oven until 
melted. After washing the floor cloth thor- 
oughly with a flannel, rub the whole surface 
lightly with a flannel dipped in the wax 
and turpentine, then rub with a dry cloth. 
Beside the polish produced, the surface is 
lightly coated with the wax, which is washed 
off together with any dust or dirt it may 
The House Maid have contracted, while the floorcloth is pre- 
served. Milk is also very useful for cleaning floor cloth, ap- 
plied after the usual washing with a damp cloth, and it 
should then be rubbed over with a dry one. 

To Clean Marble. Take two parts of soda, one of 

pumice stone, and one of finely powdered chalk. Sift these 

through a fine sieve, and mix them into a paste with water. 

Rub this well all over the marble, and the stains will be re-

258 The Care of the House 

moved: then wash it with soap and water, and a beautiful 
bright polish will be produced. 

To Whiten Stones. Wash the surface with clean 
water, and let it dry; then rub it lightly over with a flannel 
dipped in a mixture of the following materials: Boil 2 
cakes of pipe clay, 2 tablespoonfuls of carbonate of lime, 
Yz pint of size, }4 pint of stone blue water, in 2 quarts of 
water. When the stones are dry, after this mixture has 
been applied, rub them with a dry flannel till they look well. 

To Scour Boards. Mix in a saucer three parts of fine 
sand and one part of lime; dip the scrubbing brush into 
this and use it instead of soap. This will remove grease 
and whiten the boards, while at the same time it will destroy 
all insects. The boards should be well rinsed with clean 
water. If they are very greasy, they should be covered 
over in places with a coating of fullers'earth moistened with 
boiling water, which should be left on 24 hours before they 
are scoured as above directed. 

To Clean Looking Glasses. Remove, with a damp 
sponge, fly stains and other soils (the sponge may be damped 
with water or spirits of wine). After this, dust the surface 
with the finest sifted whiting or powder-blue and polish it 
with a silk handkerchief or soft cloth. Snuff of candle, if 
quite free from grease, is an excellent polish for looking 
glasses. 

To Clean Brass. Dissolve 1 oz. of oxalic acid in one 
pint of soft water. Rub it on the brass with a piece of flan- 
nel, and polish with another dry piece. This solution 
should be kept in a bottle labeled "poison," "and the bottle 
well shaken before it is used, which should be only occa- 
sionally; for in a general way the brass should be cleaned 
with pulverized rottenstone, mixed into a liquid state with 
oil of turpentine. Rub this on with a piece of soft leather, 
leave it for a few minutes, and then wipe it off with a soft 



The Care of the House 259 

cloth. Brass treated generally with the latter, and occa- 
sionally with the former mode of cleaning, will look most 
beautiful; or a very good general polish for brass may be 
made of ]4, lb. of rottenstone and 1 oz. of oxalic acid, with 
as much water as will make it into a stiff paste. Set this 
paste on a plate in a cool oven to dry, pound it very fine, 
and apply a lit'le of the powder, moistened with sweet oil, 
to the brass with a piece of leather, polishing with another 
leather or an old silk handkerchief. This powder should 
also be labeled "poison." 

To Clean and Polish Old Furniture. Make a mix- 
ture of a quart of old beer or vinegar, with a handful of 
common salt and a tablespoonful of muriatic acid, and boil it 
for fifteen minutes; put it in a bottle and warm it when 
wanted for use. Wash the furniture you wish to clean with 
soft hot water, so as to remove all the dirt, then afterward 
wash it with the mixture in the bottle; then polish with a 
soft flannel rag. 

Glue Paint for Kitchen Floors. To three pounds of 
spruce yellow add one pound, or two pounds if desired, of 
dry white lead, and mix well together. Dissolve two ounces 
of glue in one quart of water, stirring often until smooth 
and nearly boiling. Thicken the glue water after the man- 
ner of mush, until it will spread smoothly upon the floor. 
Use a common paintbrush and apply hot. This will fill all 
crevices of a rough floor. It will dry soon, and when dry 
apply boiled linseed oil with a clean brush. In a few hours 
it will be found dry enough to use by laying papers or mats 
to step on for a few days. When it needs cleaning, use hot 
"suds. 

Treasury Department Whitewash. This receipt 
for whitewashing is sent out by the Lighthouse Board of the 
Treasury Department, and will answer on wood, brick, or 
stone nearly as well as oil paint, and is quite cheap: 



260 The Care of the House 

Slack one-half bushel of unslacked lime with boiling water 
keeping it covered during the process; strain it and add a 
peck of salt dissolved in warm water; three pounds ground 
rice, put in boiling water and boiled to a thin paste; one-half 
pound powdered Spanish whiting and a pound of clear glue 
dissolved in hot water; mix these well together and let the 
mixture stand for several days. Keep the wash thus pre- 
pared in a kettle or portable furnace, and when used put it 
on as hot as possible with painter's or whitewash brushes. 

To Paper Whitewashed "Walls. Make a flour starch 
as you would for starching calico clothes, and with a white- 
wash brush wet with the starch the wall you wish to paper. 
Let it dry; then, when it is wanted to apply the paper wet 
both the wall and paper with the starch, and apply the paper 
in the ordinary way. 

To Clean Wall Paper. The following is a most 
excellent and simple method of cleaning wall paper and 
can be used with confidence in every house : Take one 
quart of flour and stir in five cents' worth of ammonia and 
enough water to make a stiff dough; work and knead until 
smooth, then wipe the paper with this batch of dough, work- 
ing it so that a clean surface will be presented with every 
stroke. Go over the paper in this way and your wall paper 
will be clean. 

A Wash for Carpets. Mix together 30 cents' worth 
of ground soap-tree bark (which can be purchased at any 
drugstore), 5 cents' worth of ammonia, one cup of vinegar, 
one and a half pails of water. Boil this mixture one hour 
in a boiler, and use it on the carpet with a sponge. 

To Destroy Carpet Bugs. Make a solution of one 
tablespoonful of corrosive sublimate in a quart of hot water 
and saturate the floors and cracks of walls or closets. A 
weaker solution can be used to sponge the carpets. It is a 
sure cure. 



The Care of the House 261 

To Destroy Cockroaches. Mix together thoroughly 
one pound of powdered sugar, one pound of powdered borax 
and ten cents' worth of Paris green. Put in all places 
where they are seen, with a small bellows or puffer. 

How to Sweep a Carpet. It is an easy matter to 
sweep well, at any rate, if we may judge by experience; for 
when a broom is put into the hands of the uninitiated, more 
harm than good generally results from the use of it. With- 
out the greatest care and some little knowledge, furniture 
and paint, by being knocked about with the broom, may soon 
receive an irreparable amount of damage. Before sweeping 
rooms, the floors should be strewed with a good amount of 
dry tea leaves, which should be saved for the purpose; these 
will attract the dust and save much harm to other furniture, 
which, as far as possible, should be covered up during the 
process. Tea leaves also may be used with advantage upon 
drugget and short-piled carpets. Light sweeping and soft 
brooms are here desirable. Many a carpet is prematurely 
worn out by injudicious sweeping. Stiff carpet brooms and 
the stout arms of inexperienced servants are their destruction. 
In sweeping thick-piled carpets, such as Axminster and 
Turkey carpets, the servant should be instructed to brush 
Always the way of the pile; by so doing they may be kept 
clean for years; but if the broom is used in a different way, 
all the dust will enter the carpet and soon spoil it. 

Furniture Polish. One pint of boiled oil, four ounces 
of vinegar, two ounces of spirits of camphor, one ounce of 
ammonia, one half ounce of antimony. Shake and let stand 
two or three days before using. 

Spots on Furniture. Spirits of camphor or ammonia 
will remove white spots from furniture. 

To Take out Marks from Mahogany. The whitish 
stain left on a mahogany table by a jug of boiling water, or 



262 The Care of the House 

a very hot dish, may be removed by rubbing in oil, and 
afterward pouring a little spirits of wine on the spot and 
rubbing it dry with a soft cloth. 

To Brighten Gilt Frames. Take sufficient flour of 
sulphur to give a golden tinge to about one and one-half 
pint of water, and in this boil four or five bruised 
onions, or garlic, which will answer the same pur- 
pose. Strain off the liquid, and with it, when cold, 
wash, with a soft brush, any gilding which requires 
restoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as new 
work. They may also be brightened in the following 
manner: Beat up the white of eggs with chloride of potass 
or soda, in the proportion of 3 oz. of eggs to 1 oz. of chloride 
of potass or soda. Blow off as much dust as possible from 
the frames, and paint them over with a soft brush dipped in 
the above mixture. They will immediately come out fresh 
and bright. 

To Preserve Cut Flowers. A bouquet of freshly cut 
flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing 
them in a glass or vase with fresh water, in which a little 
charcoal has been steeped, or a small piece of camphor dis- 
solved. The vase should be set upon a plate or dish, and 
covered with a bell glass, around the edges of which, when 
it comes in contact with the plate, a little water should be 
poured to exclude the air. 

To Revive Cut Flowers after Packing. Plunge the 
stems into boiling water, and by the time the water is cold, 
the flowers will have revived. Then cut afresh the ends of 
the stems, and keep them in fresh cold water. 

To Clean Ivory. To clean and preserve the color of 
ivory ornaments, brooches, card cases, bracelets, chains, etc., 
place the articles to be cleansed in a basin of cold water and 
allow them to remain in it twenty-four hours. Take them out 
of the water and lay them on a clean, soft towel, but do not 



The Care of the House 26$ 

wipe them, they must dry by the air, and any water that 
remains in the carving of the ivory should be blown out; if 
allowed to settle on the ivory it would destroy the color. 

To Polish Tortoise Shell. When by wear tortoise 
shell articles have lost their luster, the polished surface may 
be restored to its original conditron by carefully rubbing 
with powdered rottenstone and oil. The rottenstone should 
be very carefully sifted through the finest muslin. When all 
scratches on the surface of the tortoise shell are thus 
removed, a brilliant polish may be given to it by applying 
gentle friction with a piece of soft leather, to which some 
jeweler's rouge has been applied. 

To Clean Lamp Chimneys. Rub lamp chimneys 
with newspaper on which has been poured a little kerosene. 
This will make them much clearer than if soap is used; they 
will also be less liable to crack. 

Stains on Leather. A piece of cloth dipped in spirits 
of wine and rubbed upon soiled leather will remove every 
spot on it. 

Polish for Black Grates. One pound of common 
asphaltum, one-half pint of linseed oil, one quart of oil of 
turpentine. Melt the asphaltum, and add gradually to it 
the other two ingredients. Apply this with a small painter's 
brush, and leave it to become perfectly dry. The grate will 
need no other cleaning, but will merely require dusting every 
day, and occasionally brushing with a dry black lead brush. 
This is, of course, when no fires are used. When they are 
required, the bars, cheeks and back of grate will need black- 
leading in the usual manner. 

How to Dust a Room. Soft cloths make the best of 
dusters. In dusting any piece of furniture begin at the top 
and dust clown, wiping carefully with the cloth, which can 
be frequently shaken. A good many people seem to have no 
idea what dusting is intended to accomplish, and instead of 



264 The Care of the House 

wiping off and removing the dust it is simply flirted off into 
the air and soon settles down upon the articles dusted again. 
If carefully taken up by the cloth it can be shaken off out of 
the window into the open air. If the furniture will permit 
the use of a damp cloth, it will more easily take up the 
dust, and it can be washed out in a pail of soapsuds. It is 
far easier to save work by covering up nice furniture while 
sweeping, than to clean the dust out, besides leaving the 
furniture looking far better in the long run. 

The routine of a general servant's duties depends 
upon the kind of situation she occupies; but a systematic 
servant should so contrive to divide her work, that every 
day in the week may have its proper share. By this means 
she is able to keep the house clean with less fatigue to her- 
self than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the 
week. Supposing there are five bedrooms in the house, two 
sitting rooms, kitchen, laundry, and the usual domestic 
offices; on Monday she might thoroughly clean two of the 
bedrooms; on Tuesday, two more bedrooms; on Wednesday, 
the other bedroom and stairs; on Thursday, the drawing 
room ; on Friday morning she should sweep the dining 
room very thoroughly, clean the hall, and in the after- 
noon her kitchen tins and bright utensils. By arranging her 
work in this manner, no undue proportion will fall to 
Saturday's share, and she will then have this day for clean- 
ing plate, cleaning her kitchen, and arranging everything 
in nice order. The regular work must, of course, be per- 
formed in the usual manner, as we have endeavored to des- 
cribe. Before retiring to bed, she will do well to clean up 
plate, glasses, etc., which have been used for the evening 
meal, and prepare for her morning's work by placing her 
wood in the range, ready to light, taking care there is 
no danger of its igniting, before she leaves the kitchen for 
the night. Before retiring, she will have to lock and bolt 
the doors, unless her employer undertakes this office himself.

THE CARE OF THE PANTRY 




Washing of Glass. Glass is a beautiful and most 

fragile article; hence it requires great 

care in washing. A perfectly clean 

wooden bowl is best for this operation, 

one for moderately hot, and another for 

cold water. Wash the glasses well in 

the first and rinse them in the second, 

and turn them down on a linen cloth 

folded two or three times, to drain for a 

few minutes. When sufficiently drained, 

wipe them with a cloth and polish with a 

The Waitress. finer one, doing so tenderly and carefully. 

Accidents will happen; but nothing discredits a servant in 

the drawing room more than continual reports of breakages, 

which, of course, must reach that region. 

Decanters and water jugs require still more tender treat- 
ment in cleaning, inasmuch as they are more costly to re- 
place, Fill them about two-thirds with hot but not boiling 
water, and put in a few pieces of well soaped brown paper; 
leave them thus for two or three hours; then shake the water 
up and down in the decanters; empty this out, rinse them 
well with clean cold water, and put them in a rack to drain. 
When dry, polish them outside and inside, as far as possible, 
with a fine cloth. To remove the crust of port or other 
wines, add a little muriatic acid to the water and let it re- 
main for some time. Fine pieces of coal placed in a de- 
canter with warm water, and shaken for some time, will also 
remove stains left by wine, etc. 



265 



266 



The Care of the Pantry 




To Cleanse Bottles. Make a lye by boiling equal 
quantities of soda and quicklime, When cold, put this 
in the bottles with some small pebbles, and shake well. 
Set the bottles to drain thoroughly, then warm them, and 
blow inside with a pair of bellows to absorb all moisture. 

To Clean Plate. Mix to a paste % lb. of prepared 
chalk with 2 dr. of spirits of camphor, 1 dr. of ammonia, 1 
oz. of turpentine, and a dessertspoonful of spirits. When 
the silver is clean and dry, dab on the paste with a sponge 
and leave it to dry before brushing off. 

Plate Rags for Daily Use. Boil soft rags (nothing 

is better for the purpose than the 
tops of old cotton stockings) in 
a mixture of new milk and harts- 
horn powder, in the proportion of 
Plate Basket. * oz. of powder to a pint of 

milk; boil them for 5 minutes; wring them, as soon as they 
are taken out, for a moment in cold water, and dry them be- 
fore the fire. With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon 
as it has been well washed and dried after daily use. A most 
beautiful deep polish will be produced, and the plate will 
require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a feather 
or a dry, soft cloth before it is again put on the table. 

Washing of Knives. The handles of knives should 

never be immersed in 
water, as, after a time, if 
treated in this way, the 
blades will loosen and the 
Knife Basket. handles discolor. The 

blades should be put in a jug or vessel kept for this purpose, 
filled with hot soda water. This should be done as soon after 
they are used as possible, as stain and rust so quickly sink 
into steel.

Illness.— Bandaging Taught by Pictures. 

PART II.— In the Sick Room. 



PART III.— The Family Doctor— Allopathic and Homeo- 
pathic Methods. 



WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ACCIDENT OR 
SUDDEN ILLNESS. 

Apoplexy. Treatment. — When a person is in an apoplec- 
tic fit, prevent all unnecessary movement; raise the head and 
remove everything tight from the neck, then apply ice or 
cold water cloths to the head; put the feet in mustard and 
water or apply mustard leaves or poultices to the calves of 
the legs. 

Bruises. These are caused by blows, the skin remain- 
ing unbroken. Treatment. — Apply tincture of arnica, spirit 
and water, vinegar or sal-ammoniac and water. The follow- 
ing is a useful combination: Chloride of ammonium (sal- 
ammoniac), one ounce; rectified spirit, lavender water, or 
eau de cologne, two ounces; vinegar, three ounces; water 
to make sixteen ounces. Rags dipped in this should be laid 
over the bruise and kept constantly wet. 

Choking. Treatment. — If the substance causing choking 
be at the upper part of the throat thrust the finger and thumb 
into the mouth and endeavor to seize it. If this cannot be 
done, take a penholder, a quill, or piece of whalebone — 
anything, in fact, that will do, and endeavor to push it 
down the gullet. A smart blow on the back will sometimes 
dislodge a foreign body from the throat. 

Concussion of the Brain. Treatment. — Move the 
patient as little as possible; remove all tight articles from 
the neck. Apply hot bottles to the feet and sides, or hot 
bricks wrapped in flannel and a mustard poultice or mustard 
leaf over the stomach. 

Dislocations. Treatment. — If medical assistance is at 

269 



270 In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

hand do not touch a dislocation : in any case do not use or 
submit to rough handing. If skilled assistance cannot be 
had, get some one to seize the part of the limb nearest the 
body, and then apply gentle, steady traction upon that 
furthest removed. [See Bandaging faught by pictures.} 

Drowning. Treatment. — Place the patient on the floor 
or ground with the face downward, and one of the arms under 
the forehead. If there be only slight breathing, or no 
breathing, or if the breathing fail, then turn the patient 
instantly on the side, supporting the head, and excite the 
nostrils with snuff, hartshorn and smelling salts, or tickle 
the throat with a feather. Rub the chest and face warm, 
and dash cold water or cold and hot water alternately on 
them. If there be no success, imitate breathing, and in 




Artificial Eespiration. First Position. 

order to do this, place the patient on his back, supporting 
the head and shoulders on a small, firm cushion or folded 
article of dress. Draw the tongue forward and slip an elastic 
band over it and under the chin, or tie a piece of string or 
tape in the same way. Grasp the arms just above the elbows 



In Case of Accident or Sudden Ilhiess 271 

and draw them gently and steadily upward above the head, 
and keep them stretched upward for two seconds; {First 
Position. ) 




Artificial Respiration. Second Position. 

then turn them down and force them gently and firmly for 
two seconds against the sides of the chest; {Second Position.) 

Repeat these measures about fifteen times in a minute. 
When breathing is restored, rub the limbs upward with firm, 
grasping pressure and energy, using handkerchiefs, flannels, 
etc. Apply hot flannels or bottles, bladders of hot water or 
heated bricks to the pit of the stomach, the armpits, between 
the thighs, and to the soles of the feet. On the restoration 
of life a teaspoonful of warm water should be given, and 
then small quantities of warm coffee. 

Epilepsy. Treatment. — At the onset of a fit the patient 
should be caught in the arms of a bystander and laid gently 
down upon his back, with something under his head for a 
pillow, and everything tight should be removed from his 
neck. Insert a cork between the teeth to prevent the tongue 
being bitten, then wait patiently till the fit it is over. 

Fainting. In this affection there is pallor of the face, 
coldness, perspiration, feeble, shallow and irregular breath- 
ing, noises in the ears, indistinctness of vision, and giddiness. 



272 In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

Treatment. — Lay the patient at once upon the back; remove 
all constricting articles of clothing from about the neck, and 
apply strong smelling salts to the nostrils. Sprinkle cold 
water over the face; give half a teaspoonful of spirit of sal 
volatile by the mouth in a little water. 

Foreign Bodies. In the Nose. These are peas, beads, 
sweets, cherry stones and such like. Treatment. — If old 
enough, get the child to forcibly blow down the obstructed 
nostril after taking a deep breath, while the finger is pressed 
tightly against the free nostril. Failing this, grasp the 
nostril behind the seat of obstruction and introduce a small 
fiat article such as the handle of a salt spoon beyond it and 
endeavor to scoop it out. 

In the Ear. Treatment. — If an insect has found its way 
into the ear, fill it with olive oil, when it will generally float 
on the top. If a pea, bead or cherry stone, use the head of 
a hair pin as a snare and with the utmost gentleness endeavor 
to insinuate it beyond the object it is intended to remove. 

In the Eye. Treatment. — If the offending substance is not 
embedded in the globe of the eye it will generally be easily 
removed, either with or without everting the lid, by using 
the corner of a soft pocket handkerchief, or a camel's hair 
pencil moistened with water or olive oil. If the substance 
is embedded in the globe of the eye, a camel's hair pencil 
dipped in water or oil may be passed over it and an effort 
made to dislodge it. Should this fail, and medical assistance 
is not at hand, a blunt-pointed instrument may be carefully 
passed across the surface. Should quicklime get into the 
eye, wash it out as thoroughly as possible with water, then 
bathe with a lotion consisting of a teaspoonful of vinegar to 
a wineglassful of water, or drop a little sweet oil into the 
eye. In case of injury by acid, bathe with milk or one part 
of limewater to three of water. 

Fractures. Treatment. — When a fracture has taken place 



In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 273 

the object is to bring the ends of the bone that has been 
broken as nearly as possible to the condition they were in 
previous to the accident. In order to do this, the part 
nearest the body must be steadied by some one, while that 
furthest removed is gently stretched out, the sound limb 
being uncovered and acting as guide. Having got the limb 
into good position splints must be applied to fix it in the 
position in which it has been placed. {See Bandaging, etc.) 

Hemorrhage or Bleeding. Bleeding from an artery 
is distinguished from that of a vein by being brighter in 
color, and by its coming out of the wound in a saltatory or 
jumping way, Treatment. — If from a vein make a compress 
by folding a piece of lint or a small handkerchief up, and 
apply it to the wound with a bandage over it. This treat- 
ment also generally answers in bleeding from small arteries, 
although the pressure requires to be greater. 

From Varicose Veins. Treatment. — Place the patient on 
his back, and apply a compress and bandage, or put a 
fifty cent piece in a handkerchief, place it over the wound, 
and tie it. „\ 

From the Nose. Treatment. — Apply cold water cloths or 
ice to the forehead; raise the arms above the head; seize the 
nose between the fingers, and squeeze the sides together; 
syringe the nostrils with vinegar or hot water and salt. One 
or other of these methods may be tried, or they may all be 
tried in turn if the bleeding is difficult to check. 

From Leech Bites. Treatment. — Lay a crystal of iron alum 
upon the wound. Dried alum and tannic acid may be used 
in a similar manner. Two strong needles run through the 
skin cross-wise, passing beneath the wound, and a piece of 
linen thread tied round them, frequently answer when the 
simpler means fail. 

After Tooth Extraction. Treatment. — Press a small crystal 
of iron alum into the cavity left by the removal of the tooth, 
and bleeding will generally be checked. 

18 



274 I n Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

After Confinement. Treatment. — Keep the patient at abso- 
lute rest on her back, and remove the pillows so as to keep 
her head low; cover very lightly with bedclothes. Place 
the hands on the lower part of the belly, and press deeply 
clown with a kind of kneading motion. If the womb is felt 
contracting into a hard lump under the hands, grasp it and 
keep it tight till the arrival of the doctor. Give a little 
tepid milk and water. 

From the Umbilical Cord. When bleeding takes place from 
the umbilical cord, the child generally becomes restless, and 
blood may saturate its clothing. Treatment. — Undress the 
child immediately, and tie a ligature of three or four thick- 
nesses of worsted or linen thread behind the other. 

Internal Bleeding. Instances of this form of bleeding are 
seen in hemorrhage from the lungs and stomach. That from 
the lungs is generally bright scarlet in color and frothy in 
appearance, owing to the admixture of air; that from the 
stomach is dark in color, and is not frothy. Treatment. — 
Keep the apartment cool and the patient quiet in the 
recumbent posture. Ice may be given, or cold water when 
ice cannot be had. Five to ten grains of gallic acid may be 
given along with ten or fifteen drops of aromatic sulphuric 
acid every three or four hours. 

Hysteria. This may manifest itself by intense sobbing 
or immoderate laughter, or these may alternate with one 
another. There is frequently wild tossing about of the arms, 
the hair is disheveled, the face is generally pale and com- 
plaint is made of a suffocating feeling in the throat. Treat- 
ment. — The patient must be spoken to kindly, yet firmly, and 
be told to stop any eccentricities. Loosen the dress and 
remove anything tight from the neck. Give a teaspoonful 
of spirit of sal volatile in water. If no heed is taken in 
regard to what is said, dash cold water upon the face. 



In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 275 

Intoxication. Treatment. — When loss of consciousness 
has occurred from this cause, give an emetic of mustard and 
water (a tablespoonful in tepid water) or twenty grains of 
sulphate of zinc or powdered ipecacuanha. Remove to a 
warm atmosphere and give strong tea or coffee. 

Poisons. Treatment. — Many of these give rise to vomit- 
ing and are thus got rid of. In such cases the vomiting 
should be encouraged by giving draughts of tepid water. 
An instrument that may be used with much benefit, if it is 
at hand, is the stomach syphon— easier to use a good deal 
than the stomach pump — by which the poison may be got 
rid of. Care must be taken to pass the tube along the bach 
of the throat, as otherwise harm may result. If the poison 
has not given rise to vomiting, a handful of salt in luke- 
warm water may be given and draughts of tepid water after- 
ward. Mustard is a good emetic when the poison taken is 
not irritant in character. Twenty grains of powdered 
ipecacuanha or the same quantity of sulphate of zinc may be 
used in the same way. 

General Directions. When an alkali is the poison, g'ive 
weak vinegar, chalk and water, whiting, plaster from the 
walls. When an acid, give white of egg or milk; if a 
narcotic, give strong coffee and do everything to keep the 
patient awake. 

Particular Poisons. Aconite, Monkshood or Blue 
Rocket. Treatment. — Give a tablespoonful of mustard in 
water or twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in water; then a 
dose of castor oil. Hot bottles should be applied to the 
feet, and a teaspoonful of spirit of sal volatile in water or 
strong coffee, be given. 

Alkalies, such as potash, soda, ammonia, met with as pearl 
ashes, soap lees, common washing soda and ammonia in 
vapor, solution and solid form. Treatment. — Give drinks 
containing vinegar, or lemon juice or olive oil. 



276 In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

Arsenic. Treatment. — Give large quantities of sugar and 
water or linseed tea. 

Barytes. Treatment. — Give two teaspoonfuls of Epsom or 
Glauber's salts every two hours until the bowels act. 

Belladonna. Treatment. — Give twenty grains of sulphate 
of zinc or a tablespoonful of mustard in water; then drinks 
of tepid water. Afterward give strong coffee. 

Carbolic Acid. Treatment. — Use the stomach syphon if 
at hand, otherwise give large quantities of olive oil or 
melted butter. 

Copper. Treatment. — Give white of egg, afterward, 
enemata to act upon the bowels. 

Corrosive Sublimate. Treatment. — Give white of egg beaten 
up with water. Milk or sugar and water may be given if 
eggs are not at hand. 

Foxglove. Treatment. — Give an emetic of mustard and 
water or twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in water, then 
give a dose of castor oil and a cup of strong tea. 

Fungi. Treatment. — Give an emetic of mustard and water, 
afterward a dose of castor oil. 

Hemlock. Treatment. — Give a tablespoonful of mustard 
and water or twenty grains of sulphate of zinc; afterwards 
a dose of castor oil and strong tea. 

Henbane, Thorn Apple and Tobacco. Treatment. — The 
same as for belladonna. 

Hydrochloric Acid. Treatment. — The same as for sulphuric 
acid poisoning. 

Laburnum. Treatment. — Give a tablespoonful of mustard 
in water; then ten or fifteen drops of spirit of sal volatile in 
a little water. 

Laudanum. Treatment. — Give twenty grains of sulphate 
of zinc or a tablespoonful of mustard in water, then drinks 
of tepid water. Afterward give strong coffee and keep the 



In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 277 
patient constantly in motion till the drowsy feeling wears off. 

Lead. Treatment. — Give an emetic in the first place; then 
two teaspoonfuls of Epsom or Glauber's salts every two 
hours till the bowels act. When this has been accomplished 
continue the salts in smaller doses, after which large doses 
of iodide of potassium may be given. 

Nitric Acid or Aquafortis. Treatment. — Give bicarbonate 
or carbonate of soda or potash; in other respects the treat- 
ment is the same as for poisoning by sulphuric acid. 

Oxalic Acid or Acid of Sugar. Treatment. — Give magnesia 
or chalk mixed with water. 

Phosphorus. Treatment. — Give twenty grains of sulphate 
of zinc in water; then give lime water, barley water, linseed 
tea or white of egg and water. 

Prussic Acid. Treatment. — Dash cold water from a height 
upon the head; apply smelling salts, and employ artificial 
respiration. 

Shell Fish. Treatment. — Give an emetic, then a purga- 
tive, afterward twenty or thirty drops of spirit of sulphuric 
ether on a lump of sugar. 

Sulphuric Acid or Oil of Vitriol. Treatment. — Give bicar- 
bonate or carbonate of soda or potash. If these are not at 
hand, chalk or magnesia will do instead. Olive or almond 
oil may also be given. 

Scalds or Burns. Treatment. — When a part has been 
scalded, immerse it in cold water or pour cold water over it, 
or dust bicarbonate of soda over it and apply a wet cloth 
above this. When blisters have formed, prick them with a 
needle or pair of scissors, and press the cuticle carefully 
down, after which apply the bicarbonate of soda as before, 
or chlorate of potassium ointment (5 grains to the ounce of 
lard) or carron oil; thymol or carbolic oil (1 part to 100 
parts of olive oil) answers well. 



278 In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

Sprains. Treatment. — Foment the part well with warm 
water, then brush tincture of arnica over it several times a 
day. When the more acute symptoms have passed, wrap the 
part in cotton wool and apply a good firm bandage, India- 
rubber if it can be had, so as to diminish the swelling and 
give a feeling of security when the patient comes to move- 
about. Later on, if not quite right, use the cold douche and 
friction with a rough towel. 

Suffocation. Treatment. — If the person is found hanged 
he should be at once cut down, and artificial respiration 
employed. If the suffocation results from articles of food 
blocking up the throat, the treatment recommended in chok- 
ing must be had recourse to. If the suffocation is the result 
of breathing coal gas or sewer gas, or by being in a room in 
which charcoal has been burnt, the first thing to do is to get 
the patient out as speedily as possible. 

Sunstroke. Treatment. — Dash cold water over the 
face and head; apply ice or ice cloths, or cold water to the 
head, and give a teaspoonful of spirit of sal volatile in water. 
Tea or coffee may be given afterward. 

Wounds. The simplest are those in which the tissues 
are clean cut through, and where the edges, when brought 
together, fit accurately the one to the other. Treatment. — 
Remove all dust or dirt, and bring the edges carefully 
together by means of a bandage or strips of plaster. Keep 
at rest a few days. 

Contused or lacerated wounds should be treated by cieansing 
the parts with sanitas and water, carbolic acid and water (a 
teaspoonful to eight or ten ounces of water), or Pond's 
Extract and water, then place a piece of lint, or rag soaked 
in carbolic oil (one part to twenty of olive oil), or boro-gly- 
ceride over the wound, and keep the edges as nearly as 
possible together. 



In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 279 

Perforating wounds are dangerous because of their depth. 
Treatment. — Keep the part at rest, and apply ice-bags or 
cloths soaked in cold water, to which some sanitas or car- 
bolic acid has been added, to the wound. 

Gunshot Wounds. Treatment. — If a stimulant is necessary, 
give a teaspoonful of spirit of sal volatile in water. Remove 
pieces of clothing, wadding, or bits of paper that may be found 
in the wound, then bathe it with sanitas and water, carbolic 
acid and water, or Pond's Extract and water, then soak a piece 
of lint in carbolic oil or sanitas vaseline, and lay it into the 
wound. 

Poisoned wounds may result from a number of causes, such 
as stings of insects, snake bites, the bites of rabid animals, 
etc. 

Dog Bites. When any one is bitten by an animal supposed 
to be mad, unless the actual fact of the animal's madness is 
known, it should be kept and carefully watched, and if it is 
found not to be suffering from rabies, no harm will result to 
the patient. This will soon make itself apparent, for, if 
mad, it will be seen snapping at imaginary objects, with a 
copious flow of saliva from the mouth, and a convulsive 
closing of the jaws. Treatment. — The wound should be at 
once sucked, and a red-hot wire or a cinder laid upon it as a 
cautery, and then some soothing alkaline lotion, as ammonia 
water or lead and opium, applied. Stimulants, such as the 
spirits of sal volatile in" teaspoonful doses, may be given. 
The Pasteur treatment is the only sure cure. 

Snake Bites. Bites from venomous serpents are exceed- 
ingly formidable injuries, and may be followed by death 
within a few hours, so that prompt action is necessary. 
Treatment. — The part should be at once sucked. A tight 
bandage should be applied above the wound, either by 
means of an elastic band, a leather strap, or a handkerchief 
twisted tightly by means of a stick. The wound should 



280 In Case of Accident or Sudden Illness 

then be freely cauterized by means of a red-hot wire, or a 
red-hot cinder; or the part may be cut out with a knife, or 
a caustic, such as nitrate of silver, may be applied to the 
wound; a red-hot wire is, however, the best. Stimulants, 
especially preparations of ammonia, must be freely given. A 
teaspoonful may be put into a wineglassful of water, and the 
patient given a tablespoonful every quarter of an hour. If 
those present are afraid to suck the wound, a wineglass, 
into which a piece of burning paper has been put to exhaust 
the air, should be inverted over it. 

Stings. If the sting still remains in the wound, it must of 
eourse be removed; then some alkaline lotion should be 
applied to the part, such as a little ammonia water or liquor 
potassas and water, or bicarbonate of soda and water. 

Note : A number of the above cases are also mentioned and treated 
more fully in The Family Doctor. The Editor thought, however, that 
the grouping under one hea'ding of all these cases which are generally called 
"Emergencies," would be well received features of TREASURES OLD 
AND NEW.

IN THE SICK ROOM 



Furnishing of the Sick Room. No unnecessary 
article of furniture should be found in the sick room. If 
there is space to accommodate two beds so much the better, 
as the day can be passed in one and the night in the other. 
An iron bedstead is the most convenient, the mattress should 
be of hair, and the pillow the same. All curtains should be 
removed. Light blankets only should be used as a covering 
for the sick. In addition to the bed or beds there should be 
two tables, a wash stand, a chest of drawers, one or two chairs 
and a sofa. The wash stand, should be provided with one or 
two basins and a plentiful supply of water. The room is 
perhaps better uncarpeted; if carpeted, the carpet must be 
removed in cases of infectious disease. If there is a mirror 
in the room it had better be taken away. Flowers may be 
placed about the room, and the walls should be hung with 
pictures. 

Ventilation. One of the foremost subjects to be treated 
of in a chapter on sick nursing is that of ventilation. It is 
impossible to deal successfully with disease if fresh air is 
debarred from entering the sick room; because impure air 
not only depresses those already weakened by disease, but the 
poison in the case of infectious disease becomes concentrated, 
and in consequence more injurious both to patient and nurse. 
In order to ventilate in the true sense of the word, fresh air 
must be admitted without giving rise to draughts, and impure 
air must be got rid of. Perhaps the most efficient means 



283 



284 In the Sick Room 

capable of general employment is by means of a window and 
open fire. The lower sash of the window may be raised an 
inch or two, and boarded up; the fresh air will then enter 
at the center, and be diffused without causing draught. 

Light. An abundant supply of light may, with one or 
two exceptions, be regarded as essential in the sick room. 
The exceptions are cases of eye disease and affections of the 
brain, when it becomes necessary to moderate the light 
admitted to the sick chamber. In most other instances the 
sun's rays must be looked upon as beneficial; they exert a 
great oxidizing power upon organic matters, and render them 
innocuous. The patient's bed should be so placed that he 
can easily see out of window. All lights employed for 
purposes of artificial illumination should be so placed that 
the eye does not suffer. 

Temperature. A good fire in the sick room kept burn- 
ing equally will suffice to maintain a uniform temperature, 
but care must be taken to see that the chimney is acting well. 
The temperature which answers best in the sick room in most 
cases is one about 6o° Fahrenheit. It is well to regulate it 
by means of a thermometer. Should it be necessary to in- 
crease this, it can be done by permitting steam to pass into 
the room from a kettle: or if it is necessary to cool the air 
of the apartment, this can be readily accomplished by plac- 
ing a shallow dish containing pieces of ice in the room or 
by suspending a piece of cloth that has been previously 
moistened with water. 

Food. Food must be properly cooked and given at 
regular intervals to be determined by the nature of the case. 
Everything intended for the invalid's use should be made 
ready out of his sight and be brought on scrupulously clean 
dishes, and not too much at a time. Punctuality must be at- 
tended to, and strict quiet enjoined at meal times. (See 
special chapter on the subject). 



In the Sick Room 285 

Cleanliness. In the treatment of disease attention to 
cleanliness is of the utmost importance. If the sickroom 
is carpeted it should be swept with a soft hair broom; if 
without carpet it can be gone over with sponges wrung out 
of hot water and dried by means of the floor brush. Damp 
cloths may be used instead of sponges. The articles of 
furniture may be dusted by means of damp cloths. The 
walls should be painted or whitewashed with lime. The 
body linen ought to be frequently changed and the hands 
and face washed daily. The hair should also be combed out 
at the same time. The body should also be frequently 
washed with a sponge or flannel and tepid water, only small 
portions being exposed at one time. It should be rapidly 
dried with a heated towel. 

Tranquility. This is most essential to speedy recovery. 
Whispering is objectionable in the sick room; so also is talk- 
ing outside the patient's door. All slamming of doors should 
be avoided. The room immediately over the sick room 
should, if possible, remain unoccupied. The admission of 
too many people into the sick room is another fruitful source 
of harm to a patient. 

Influence of Mind on Body. Anything that weighs 
upon a patient's mind producing care or anxiety, exerts a 
depressing influence upon the nervous system and retards re- 
covery. Everything of this kind should, therefore, be care- 
fully guarded against. It is a part of the duties of those who 
wait upon the sick to cheer them and instil hope into their 
minds; otherwise fear may take possession of them and add 
to their danger. 

Convalescence. This is that condition in which the 
period of active disease being at an end, the powers of nature 
are exerted toward repairing the waste of structure that has 
occurred during disease. During convalescence the greatest 
care is necessary, as relapses may occur and the disease end 



286 In the Sick Room 

fatally, or it may assume a chronic form. It is now that the 
injudiciousness of friends begins to manifest itself, and 
unless firmness be exercised on the part of those in attend- 
ance, the patient may suffer through their mistaken kindness. 
One oi the most frequent signs of returning health is the 
return of the patient's appetite, but it must be remembered 
that his desire for food should never be fully satisfied. The 
time which the patient must remain in bed varies in individual 
cases, and can only be satisfactorily determined by the 
medical attendant. When a person gets out of bed for the 
first time after a severe illness he is generally only allowed 
up for a short time, and the effect produced upon him must 
be carefully watched. The clothing of the patient should be 
warm and comfortable. A change to the seaside will often 
work wonders. During convalescence, if the patient is at 
all intellectually inclined, much pleasure may be given him 
by reading to him or by supplying him with literature of an 
interesting nature. A little more caution during convalescence 
than is usually found, and the chances of relapse occurring 
would be greatly lessened, an otherwise precarious time 
rendered comparatively safe, and the patient's recovery be 
made more permanent and complete. 

Sick Nursing. All women are likely, at some period 
of their lives, to be called on to perform the duties of a sick 
nurse, and should prepare themselves as much as possible, 
by observation and reading, for the occasion when they may 
be required to fulfil the office. The main requirements are 
good temper, compassion for suffering, sympathy with suf- 
ferers, which most women worthy oi the name possess, neat 
handedness, quiet manners, love of order, and cleanliness. 
With these qualifications there will be very little to be 
wished for: the desire to relieve suffering will inspire a 
thousand little attentions, and surmount the disgust which 
some of the offices attending the sick room are apt to create. 



In the Sick Room 287 

Where serious illness visits a household, and protracted nurs- 
ing is likely to become necessary, a professional nurse will 
probably be engaged who has been trained to its duties; but 
in some families, and those not a few, let us hope, the: ladies 
of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure 
of duty on their part. There is, besides, even when a profes- 
sional nurse is ultimately called in, a period of doubt and 
hesitation, while disease has not yet developed itself, when 
the patieni must be attended to; and, in these cases, some 
of the female servants of the establishment must give their 
attendance in the sick room. There are, also, slight attacks 
of cold, influenza, and accidents in a thousand forms, to 
which all are subject, where domestic nursing becomes a 
necessity; where disease, though unattended with danger, 
is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident 
to illness, and when all the attention of the domestic nurse 
becomes necessary. 

Doctor's Orders are never disregarded by a nurse 
worthy of the name. Should she by watching the case think 
any other treatment or diet would be beneficial to the patient, 
she should not act upon her own opinion, but state it to the 
doctor. She should always report to him any change she 
observes in the patient, which she should be watchful to 
detect. The hearty co-operation of a nurse is of incalculable 
help to a doctor. 

Administering Medicine. Although this is given by 
medical advice, and at the time the doctor orders it as a 
rule, it sometimes happens that a bottle sent has only the 
indefinite directions such as "A dessertspoonful twice daily" 
or "A wineglassful every four hours," and in the case of an 
amateur being the nurse it may not be given at the best 
times. 

When medicines have to be taken at intervals during the 
dav, it is best to arive it at first at 10 o'clock in the morn- 



288 In the Sick Room 

ing; if only once during the day, then at nine in the morn- 
ing, or at bedtime; if twice, at 10 and 4 o'clock. 

It is always safest to have a medicine glass marked with 
the different measures, for the size of the spoons may con- 
siderably vary in different households; and it cannot be too 
firmly impressed upon the nurse, whether professional or 
amateur, that regularity and exactitude in the administra- 
tion of medicine are absolutely essential, the only deviation 
from the time fixed for it being made when the patient 
happens to be asleep at the specified hour. 

Professional Nurses need not only the qualifications 
already named in addition to their training, they should be 
physically strong, have good health, nerves well under control, 
and be sure that nursing to them is a congenial occupation. 
What a friend or relative can do for one she holds dear in the 
time of sickness, the taxing of strength, the loss of sleep that 
she makes light of in such a case, is no proof that she is fitted 
for the post of a professional nurse. The very self-sacrifice is 
against this, for a nurse must do what she does in a business 
like way; she must not over-fatigue herself, should eat, 
drink and sleep well, and take regular exercise; while it 
should not be (as it is so often to the amateur) actual suffer- 
ing to see pain inflicted when it is necessary that any opera- 
tion be performed. She should be like the surgeon, able to 
think of the future good instead of the present suffering. 

To some nervous, highly organized persons this would be 
impossible, and they are therefore unsuited for nursing as a 
business, althongh they may be the most devoted and patient 
attendants upon those they love. 

In the First Stage of Sickness, while doubt and a 
little perplexity hang over the household as to the nature of 
the sickness, there are some things about which no doubts 
exist; the patient's room must be kept in a perfectly pure 
state, and arrangements made for proper attendance; for the 



In the Sick Room 289 

first canon of nursing, according to Florence Nightingale, 
its apostle, is to "keep the air the patient breathes as pure 
as the external air, without chilling him." This can be 
done without any preparation which might alarm the patient ; 
with proper windows, open fireplaces, and a supply of fuel, 
the room may be as fresh as it is outside, and kept at a 
temperature suitable for the patient's state. 

Fomentations. Sometimes these are medicated and 
rendered more soothing by the addition of opiates, as in the 
well-known decoction of chamomile flowers and poppy heads, 
but the principal object for which they are employed is to 
convey warmth to a part. The best application of this kind 
is made by wringing flannel — by means of two sticks turned 
in opposite directions — out of boiling water, and then, 
shaking it up, apply it lightly to the part. In this way the 
heat may be retained for a considerable time. In order to 
do this thoroughly, two pieces of flannel should be made 
use of, each of the pieces being about three yards long, and 
having the ends sewn together so as to admit of the boiling 
water being wrung out of them. One of these should always 
be getting ready while the other is being applied. The 
coarser the flannel the more efficiently do^s it act; owing to 
its diminished power of conducting heat, warmth is longer 
retained. 

Poultices. There are few applications more constantly 
in demand in sickness than poultices, and yet few people 
make them well. Poultices, when made well, should be 
sufficiently thick to retain their humidity, but not too thick, 
as they may then press injuriously upon the part to which 
they are applied. They should be of uniform consistence 
throughout, and ought to be applied at a proper temperature. 
This last can generally be ascertained by applying the 
poultice to the back of the hand or to the faci before putting 
it to the part. 

19 



290 In the Sick Room 

Linseed Meal Poultices. That which is of most frequent 
use is a poultice of linseed meal. It should be boiled till it 
is of the consistence of a thick pap, when it will retain heat 
and moisture longer. Instead of using water alone a decoc- 
tion of mallows may be employed, by which the emollient 
properties will be increased. The surface may be smeared 
with olive oil or lard. A piece of gauze may be applied 
over the surface of the poultice, if it is considered necessary 
to interpose anything between it and the skin. 

Besides poultices made from linseed meal, there are others 
in frequent use, such as those made from bread and water, 
oatmeal, arrowroot, bran ; and others, which are much less 
often employed, made from carrots, potatoes, onions, etc. 
In addition to these there are poultices more strictly medi- 
cated, such as those made of foxglove or hemlock. As these 
may prove dangerous if carelessly employed, they ought 
only to be made use of when ordered by the medical 
attendant. 

Mustard Poultice. This is ordinarily made by sprinkling 
the surface of a linseed meal poultice with mustard, and 
covering it with muslin to retain the mustard in its place. 




The Invalid's Air-cushion. 



Ill 

THE FAMILY DOCTOR 

Prescriptions are herein found which apply to some of the cases 
mentioned in a preceding chapter, ' ' What to Do in Case of 
Accident or Sudden Illness." They have been pre- 
served, hozvever, as they are more especially ap- 
plicable to home treatment in general. 



Asthma. The attack most frequently comes on between 
one and three o'clock in the morning. The sufferer sits or 
stands up, leaning forward, and labors to breathe. The 
countenance is anxious, with pallor, coldness, and in severe 
cases, lividness of the face and hands. The attack may pass 
over in a few minutes, or may last for hours; or, with some 
remission, days or weeks. Death almost never occurs during 
the fit of asthma. Those subject to it often live to old age. 
But dilation of the pulmonary air-cells, and enlargement of 
the heart, may follow in protracted cases, breaking down the 
health. Asthma is hereditary in a majority of cases. Males 
have it more often than females. Smoke, fog, fumes of 
various things, ipecac, mustard, new hay may cause it. 
During the attack take the following: Take of wine of 
ipecac and tincture of lobelia, each a half a fluid ounce. 
Mix, and take one-half teaspoonful every half hour until 
expectoration or nausea occurs. Smoking tobacco relieves 
in some instances; smoking cigarettes of stramonium leaves 
in others, as also the inhalation of burning nitre paper. 

As an adjuvant, the warm mustard foot bath may be 
employed, as well as mustard plaster or dry cupping applied 
between the shoulders. Take of nitre, half a drachm, 

291 



292 The Family Doctor 

powdered anise seed, half an ounce, powdered stramonium 
leaves, one ounce; mix, place a thimbleful in a plate, light 
it, and inhale the fumes. Between the attacks, take five 
grains of iodide of potassium three times a day. No disease 
is more curiously capricious in its causation than asthma. 
Some always have an attack if they visit the seashore; 
others are more secure there than elsewhere. Each must 
learn his own peculiarities, and be governed thereby. The 
climate of Colorado is said to possess a remarkable influence 
in promoting the amelioration and cure of asthma. 

Biliousness. Take of ipecac, 3 grains; blue mass, 8 
grains; compound extract of colocynth, 16 grains; mix, and 
divide into eight pills. Take one at night and morning. 
Generally in mild cases, two or three grains of blue mass at 
bedtime, followed in the morning by citrate of magnesia, or 
a seidlitz powder will give relief. The diet should be light, 
and fifteen grain doses of bicarbonate of soda should be taken 
twice a day for several days. 

Bronchitis. It is an inflammation of the membrane lining 
the bronchial tubes. It may be acute or chronic, and affect 
the larger or smaller tubes, or both; or one or both lungs 
throughout, or only a portion of them. The causes are 
usually cold, damp, wet, exposure to vicissitudes of weather, 
inhalation of irritants, etc. Acute bronchitis may be dan- 
gerous in old persons and young children; seldom fatal in 
vigorous middle life. Chronic bronchitis is not often fatal, 
even by exhaustion, but it may last an indefinite time, even 
many months. Abortive treatment of a " cold on the 
chest" may sometimes be effected within the first twenty- 
four hours by taking at bedtime, a glass of hot lemonade, 
six grains of quinine, or ten grains of dover powder, after a 
warm mustard footbath. Should this treatment fail, and 
there be a dry imperspirable skin, afebrile state, cough and 
difficulty in breathing, and breast sore, frequent draughts of 



The Family Doctor 293 

flaxseed tea should be taken, also a brisk saline purgative of 
epsom salt or Rochelle salts, or citrate of magnesia. A large 
mustard plaster should be applied to the chest, or frictions 
made with oil of turpentine. The following prescriptions 
will also give prompt relief : Take of tartar emetic, one grain; 
morphine sulphate, one grain; syrup of wild cherry two 
ounces; mix, take a teaspoonful every two or three hours. 
Syrup of ipecac % or % teaspoonful doses every two or three 
hours, will also act well, and it should be continued until the 
cough softens, and the breathing becomes easier. When the 
expectoration is free, use the following cough mixture: Take 
of muriate of ammonia, 2 drachms; Brown's mixture, 4 
ounces; mix; take a teaspoonful four times a day. Or any 
of the following cough mixtures: Take of syrup of squills, 
5 ounces; paregoric, one ounce; mix; take a teaspoonful 
three or four times a day. Or the following domestic mix- 
ture: Take of molasses, ^ pint; rum, y 2 pint; vinegar of 
squills, y 2 gill; laudanum, 40 drops. Mix and take a des- 
sertspoonful three times a day, half hour before meal. Or, 
carbonate of ammonia, 60 grains; spirits of chloroform 2 
drachms; syrup of snakeroot, 2 ounces; water enough to 
make 6 ounces; mix, take a tablespoonful four times a day. 
If there be a history of gout or rheumatism, iodide of potas- 
sium and balsamic remedies should be taken. If there be 
debility and impoverishment of the blood, iron will assist the 
cure. In many cases, change to a warm climate may be 
distinctly indicated, as cold air is found to keep up and ag- 
gravate the lingering mischief. When bronchitis remains in 
a chronic form from sheer debility in the patient, the cod 
liver oil, syrup hypophosphites compound, and good food, 
are the measures which will be found most satisfactory. 

Bruises. A bruise or contusion is an injury caused by a 
fall, a wrench, or a blow from a blunt instrument, without 
rupture of the skin. It is to be treated by keeping the part 
at rest, and cold or iced water, or a bladder containing ice 



294 The Family Doctor 

should be applied at once. Hamamelis is also a good appli- 
cation. Should there be an inflammatory pain and swelling, 
apply leeches. To produce absorption of the effused fluids 
and restore the use of the parts, use friction with a 
stimulating liniment, and lastly apply a bandage. After 
tenderness has subsided, take of oil of turpentine, spirit of 
camphor, water of ammonia and olive oil, each two table-^ 
spoonfuls; mix well together, and rub externally. 

Burns and Scalds. Collapse comes on from the ter- 
rible shock to the nervous system through the impression on 
the widely distributed cutaneous nerves. The pulse is then 
very low, the body cold, commonly thirst is great. The 
treatment for this prostrated condition must be stimulant as 
well as quieting. Whiskey or wine should be given as freely 
as in any other condition of positive debility or exhaustion. 
The patient's clothes should be gently and carefully removed, 
being cut wherever they are adherent to the body. If blist- 
ers have formed, they should be pricked and the serum let 
out, but the cuticle should on no account be detached. For 
a local application nothing is better than limewater and 
linseed oil, equal parts, well shaken, on cotton wadding, and 
covered with oil silk. When once the dressing has been 
applied, it should be changed as seldom as possible — indeed, 
only where the discharges render such change absolutely 
necessary. In this way, the repair goes on most favorably, 
and the patient is saved from much pain and distress. If 
the burn is deep, this treatment should be followed for a 
few days, and then poultices should be applied. When the 
sloughs have separated, the wound should be treated with a 
weak solution of carbolic acid until cicatrization is complete. 

Catarrh. An inflammation of a mucous membrane, 
especially of the air passages of the head and throat, with 
an exudation on its free surface. 



The Family Doctor 295 

Treatment. — Simple but effective. Take one ounce 
each of fine salt, pulverized borax and baking soda, mix 
theroughly together and dissolve in one-half pint of water. 
To use take one tablespoonful of the solution to two or three 
of warm water, and snuff up the head at bedtime. The salt 
stimulates, the borax cleanses and heals, and the soda 
soothes; use soft water. 

Cholera. (Asiatic or Epidemic Cholera.) This last 
disease seems to have been known in India for centuries, 
and to have its natural home or headquarters in the Delta of 
the Ganges. In this country the disease has almost always 
prevailed in its worst form, in poor, crowded dwellings, 
among those whose food supply was bad and whose hygienic 
conditions were otherwise unfavorable; but especially among 
those who had a tainted supply of water. Very frequently 
when cholera prevails, diarrhoea also does. 

In a case of ordinary intensity, the disease is ushered in 
by an attack of diarrhoea. This may last a longer or shorter 
period, but speedily the matters passed by the bowel assume 
a flocculent or rice-water character. Vomiting, too, comes 
on, the fluid being thin and colorless. Then follow severe 
cramps, especially of the abdominal muscles and legs. The 
flow of urine ceases, the body becomes icy cold on the sur- 
face, the tongue is cold, and so even is the breath. The 
lips are blue and shriveled, the face pinched, the voice is 
hardly audible. This is called the cold or algid state of the 
disease. The condition may go on getting worse till the 
heart stops the patient being quite conscious to the end. 
Frequently it is impossible to tell whether the patient is to 
live or die, when suddenly the sickness lessens, the body 
begins to get warm, the face flushes, and restlessness sub- 
sides. The patient seems on the very verge of getting well. 
But sometimes the urine does not flow, or there may be con- 
gestion of the lungs or brain, and so, though reaction has 



296 The Family Doctor 

set in, the man may yet perish. Thus, in an ordinary mild 
case of cholera, a man will pass through three stages: 
Firstly, that of premonitory diarrhoea; secondly, that of 
collapse; and thirdly, that of reaction, probably in about 
forty-eight hours. 

The disease is produced by some particular poison, which 
may be transmitted through the air, by water, or communi- 
cated by one individual to another. There can be no. doubt 
that the discharges are one main source of this poison, and 
hence should be most carefully disinfected. 

He who would avoid cholera during a cholera season ought 
to live by rule and method. First, see that his water closets 
are in good order, and that every precaution is taken in 
cleansing and disinfecting them. Any good carbolic acid 
powder answers very well for this purpose. See that the 
house is clean, sweet and airy; let no foul and decaying 
matters remain upon the premises. See that the water supply 
is pure. Let no stale meat or vegetables, no sausage, game 
or substances likely to create digestive disturbance be used; 
avoid unripe fruit, prolonged abstinence from food, and ex- 
cessive fatigue. Avoid strong aperient medicines of every 
kind. The astringents to be used should not be powerful ; 
chalk mixture, sulphuric acid, lemonade, or these with a 
little opium added, are best. 

No Diarrhoea in Cholera time is to be Neglected, Try to keep 
up the bodily heat in every way that will not disturb or 
fatigue the patient. The patient is consumed with thirst 
and there is no reason for refusing him drink if it is of a 
wholesome kind. Should reaction occur he must be kept 
quiet. If his head troubles him, and his face is flushed, 
apply cold water to it. If there is much sickness, let him 
have a little ice or ice water. If his lungs get gorged, 
warm poultices or turpentine stupes will be best. But the 
great anxiety is the kidneys. If they do not act, warmth 
must be tried, perhaps as a warm bath, but this requires 



The Family Doctor 297 

caution. If they are acting well and the patient requires 
a stimulant, let him have some sal volatile. The food given 
is of especial importance; broths, soups and jellies maybe 
given, but certainly not meat. Small quantities must be 
given at a time, and repeated as frequently as necessary. 

One of the greatest dangers in the disease is the collapse 
produced by the extraction of the water from the system. 
To counteract this, salt water is sometimes injected into the 
veins. This, of course, should not be done except by a 
physician or surgeon. Almost equally efficient, however, 
are methods which can be used by any one in safety. 

As a result of the extraction of the water the blood flows 
less freely,' the hands and feet and ears first begin to get 
cold and purple, the temperature of the body falls, some- 
times alarmingly. If now the patient is put in a bath tub, 
and kept there with only his head out of the water, and the 
water is kept at a temperature of 100 degrees to 102 degrees 
Fahrenheit, further loss of heat will be prevented, and the 
system will absorb some water from the bath. The tem- 
perature of the patient must be kept up as near normal as 
possible. Perhaps a bath like this is not obtainable. If so, 
the use of a hot pack may be a good substitute, wrapping 
the patient in sheets wrung out of hot water and covering 
him thoroughly with woolen blankets. An old way of using 
the hot pack consisted in boiling a lot of corn on the ear, 
and packing the hot corn all around the patient. Hot 
bottles and water bags are better than nothing, but in this 
case moist heat is better than dry heat. 

The blood must not be allowed to stagnate. To prevent 
this the extremities should be rubbed firmly toward the body. 
Don't simply chafe the skin, but grasp the hand or foot 
firmly and press the blood along toward the heart. 

Asphyxia is often found in the disease, the lungs being 
collapsed and emptied of air. To counteract this condition 



298 The Family Doctor 

prompt and intelligent action, as if to resuscitate a 
drowning person. Place the patient upon his back, with a 
small pillow under the small of the back. Place yourself at 
his head, and grasping both his elbows, raise the arms 
alongside the patient's head. This expands the chest; 
Then force the elbows against the chest and express the air. 
This should be done about fifteen times a minute. The 
action should be strong, regular, and not sudden or jerking. 
At the same time the bodily heat must be preserved. 

The judicious use of alcohol internally is of great assist- 
ance in the collapsed stage, but it is often abused. 

There is relatively little danger of the spread of the 
disease from the exhaled breath or from the urine. The 
danger is great from the discharges from the bowels. It is 
found that the bacteria are less strong and less prolific when 
first discharged. After standing a little time they are very 
prolific and hard to kill. 

Discharges should therefore be passed into a solution of 
corrosive sublimate (proportion 1 to 1,000) or into a 4 per 
cent, solution of carbolic acid, to which has been added a 
little sulphuric acid. Even with these precautions they 
should not be allowed to remain in the room. They should, 
if possible, be burned. Under no condition should they be 
cast into the sewers without previous disinfection. Neither 
should a surface or dry closet be used. 

Absolute rest is demanded to preserve the strength of the 
patient, and prevent the rapid exhaustion. In fact, fatigue 
is one of the strong, predisposing causes of the disease. 
When exhausted by work or worry, and especially when the 
nervous system is exhausted, a person otherwise proof 
against the disease will quickly fall under exposure. 

Cholera. (Asiatica.) Sir Edwin Arnold, who has spent 
much time in India and other countries where cholera is 
more or less prevalent at all times, has this to say of that 



The Family Doctor 299 

dread disease: "No well or prudent man should fear the 
disease;. Just go about as usual, and don't think of it. 
Why, I have seen so much of it, and been so close to it, that 
I have not the slightest fear of it. I'll tell you my own 
preventive, which I have used in India with the very best 
results. The cholera bacillus does not like acid. He can't 
stand it at all. So every other morning, when the cholera 
actually appears, I would take, if I were you, five drops of 
hydrochloric acid in a cup of tea. You will find it excellent 
as a preventive, if you are also careful in your habits of life. 
I don't believe in quarantine." 

Here is another effective cure for cholera, dysentery, flux 
in its worst stages. Some years ago 50,000 people died in 
Constantinople in fifty days. The following receipt is 
taken from the report of our missionaries, who had 200 
cases under their care, and did not lose a single case: One- 
quarter of an ounce of tincture of laudanum, one-quarter of 
an ounce of tincture of camphor, one-quarter of an ounce 
of tincture of capsicum, one-quarter of an ounce of tincture 
of cardamom, one-quarter of an ounce of tincture of ginger, 
one-eighth of an ounce of peppermint. Dose, fifteen drops 
in half tumbler of water; a swallow of this every fifteen or 
twenty minutes until relieved. And now, we add: 

A Few More Words of General Advice. Do not 

unnecessarily visit cholera patients or cholera houses; 
receive no visitors from cholera regions. It is best to avoid 
large gatherings or even schools during cholera times. 

Do not handle or use any food coming from a house where 
cholera exists; in case of any possible doubt whether the 
food comes from where the disease exists, it should be boiled 
or cooked. This applies particularly to milk. As milk can 
but rarely be traced to its source, all milk should be boiled. 
Ten minutes' actual boiling kills the cholera germs without 
fail.

Cholera Morbus. It generally occurs during warm 
weather. The direct causes are indigestible articles of food, 
as unripe fruit, etc., sudden change of temperature, checking 
perspiration, excess of ordinary food. A large mustard 
plaster should be applied over the stomach, and followed by 
a spice poultice, of ginger, cloves, and cinnamon, each a 
full teaspoonful, with a tablespoonful of flour moistened 
with whiskey. Ice is good to relieve thirst. Internally 
give: Take of aromatic spirit of ammonia, one drachm; 
calcined magnesia, one drachm; peppermint water, four 
ounces. Mix; take a teaspoonful every twenty minutes 
until relieved. Should there be much diarrhoea, add to the 
above two drachms of paregoric, and omit the magnesia. 
Give brandy or whiskey if there should be much prostra- 
tion. 

Cholera Infantum, popularly known as " summer 
complaint" is very destructive to children during the hot 
weather. The period of dentition is particularly liable to 
this disorder; it seldom occurs after two or three years of 
age. In the early stage, these powders will be found quite 
useful: Take of calomel, two grains; bicarbonate of sodium, 
one scruple; powder of ginger, twelve grains; mix, and 
divide into twelve powders, and give one three of four times 
a day. Or take of mercury with chalk and powder of cin- 
namon each twelve grains; mix, and divide into twelve 
powders. Give one three times a day. To check diarrhoea, 
give this: Take of tincture of krameria, paregoric, each a 
fluid drachm; sugar and gum arabic, each x /i drachm; cin- 
namon water enough to make two fluid ounces; mix, and 
give a teaspoonful every two, three or four hours. The 
food should be limewater and fresh milk, arrowroot, farina, 
chicken water, and beef tea. So long as vomiting continues, 
keep over the stomach a spice poultice wet with brandy. Ice 
may be given to quench thirst.

Chronic Rheumatism is most common in those ad- 
vanced in age, although any one may have this affection. It 
is a sort of slow inflammation of the fibrous tissues, investing 
the joints and muscles, following exposure to cold and wet. 
The thighs especially exposed to the rain during a stormy 
ride are the common seats of chronic rheumatic pains. If 
the pains are restricted to the collar-bone, humerus, and the 
shin, they suggest the probability of a syphilitic factor. 
One thing pretty certain in cases of chronic rheumatism is 
that they are almost invariably accompanied by an inactive 
condition of the skin. Consequently, a distinct part in the 
treatment is to make use of those remedies which act on the 
skin, and known in medical term as diaphoretics. Guaiac 
is perhaps the most typical of these. Muriate of ammonia 
is another. They form an excellent combination in the 
rheumatism of young men and women : Take of muriate of 
ammonia, two drachms; guaiacum mixture, eight ounces; 
mix, and take a tablespoonful three or four times a day. 
Whenever there is a history of exposure in elderly persons, 
especially associated with florid complexion, the following 
prescription forms a capital remedy: Take of bicarbonate of 
potash, two and one-half drachms; iodide of potassium, four 
scruples; guaiacum mixture, eight ounces. Mix, and take 
a tablespoonful three or four times a day. At the same time, 
the skin must be kept warm and covered with flannel. Warm 
drinks are always indicated, and should largely take the 
place of solid food. Another prescription which is often use- 
ful is the following: Take of nitrate of potassium, an ounce 
and one-half; sulphur an ounce; guaiacum half an ounce; 
add two nutmegs, and a half pint of molasses; mix. Take 
a teaspoonful or two at night. In addition to the general 
measures, it is customary to use local applications; they 
generally do more good than medicine. They consist of hot 
irons, plasters and liniments. Take of oil of sassafras two 
fluid drachms ; water of ammonia, a tablespoonful; camph- 



302 The Family Doctor 

orated soap liniment, three fluid ounces; mix, use as liniment. 
Should the pain be considerable, chloroform or aconite 
liniment may be applied. Blisters are sometimes advisable 
in bad cases. 

Chronic Ulcers. The treatment should consist in tak- 
ing internally a tonic mixture, as this: Take of iodide of 
potassium, three drachms; Fowler solution, one drachm; 
compound syrup of sarsaparilla, four ounces; water enough 
to make eight ounces. Mix; take- a teaspoonful three times 
a day. The ulcer should be treated locally with this oint- 
ment: Iodoform, one drachm; vaseline, one ounce. Mix; 
use in a thin layer every night. A light woolen bandage 
should be applied over it, and the parts cleansed with tar- 
soap, and the sore dressed every night. 

Cold in the Head. Use the following snuff: Muriate 
of morphine, two grains ; powdered gum arabic, two drachms ; 
subnitrate of bismuth, six drachms; mix. 

Colic. There are several varieties of colic. The flatulent, 
the bilious, the spasmodic, gouty or rheumatic, the lead 
colic. The flatulent colic is usually caused by indigestion. 
If the stomach is overloaded, an emetic will be proper; a 
teaspoonful of mustard, or a tablespoonful of salt in a tea- 
cupful of warm water, repeated in ten minutes if necessary; 
then give a teaspoonful of magnesia with twenty drops of 
essence of ginger. Should the stomach be much unsettled 
and the pain violent, warm fomentations should be applied 
over the bowels, a mustard plaster over the pit of the stomach, 
and the following given: Take of bicarbonate of sodium, 
i drachm; aromatic spirit of ammonia, i drachm; paregoric, 
4 drachms; peppermint water, 3^ ounces; mix, take a tea- 
spoonful every twenty minutes until relieved. Infants are 
especially liable to crapulent colic. Very simple treatment 
will often suffice for these. Peppermint water or infusion of 
fennel seed will frequently be enough, with the application 



The Family Doctor 303 

of a warm flannel over the stomach ; wetting it with essence 
of ginger will make it more efficient. The following will 
not fail to give prompt relief in worse cases: Take of bi- 
carbonate of sodium, Yt, drachm; aromatic spirit of ammonia, 
^drachm, syrup of ginger, ^ fluid ounce; camphor water, 
enough to make two fluid ounces, mix. Dose, a teaspoonful, 
repeated if neces'sary. Keeping the bowels regular, never 
allowing a day to pass without an evacuation is most import- 
ant in young children. For this purpose, the simple syrup 
of rhubarb, manna, are the best medicines. Overfeeding an 
infant is a very common cause of colic. In bilious colic, 
the bowels shoud be opened; if the stomach will bear it, 
castor oil is the most effectual cathartic. Magnesia is also 
good. The same line of treatment may be pursued as the 
one given above for flatulent colic. If there is reason to 
believe that the passage of a gall stone is the cause of the 
severe pain, the warm bath will be useful to promote relaxa- 
tion. Phosphate of sodium is a good solvent of biliary 
stones. It can be taken in drachm doses three times a day. 
In gouty, or rather cramps of the stomach, Warner's cordial 
is good, taken in teaspoonful to tablespoonful doses in hot 
water. Essence of ginger, 10 drops, or oil of cajuput, 5 or 
6 drops, on a lump of sugar often gives immediate relief. 

Lead colic must be treated with epsom salts. Castor oil 
as a purgative, the warm bath to relax spasm, and 10 to 20 
drops of laudanum to relieve pain and spasm. A milk diet 
is recommended in this affection. 

Constipation. There is no more frequent source of bodily 
discomfort than constipation of the bowels. The principal 
causes are neglect of timely attendance upon the calls of 
nature, want of exercise, excess of mental strain, and all 
the causes of dyspepsia, of which it is an almost constant 
part. Fresh and stewed fruits are the best natural laxatives. 
Prunes are especially opening. The following prescriptions 
will be found quite useful. In mild forms: Take of rhubarb 



304 The Family Doctor 

root and Castile soap each, half a drachm; oil of anise, four 
drops; mix, and divide into twenty pills. Take one or two 
as required. Or, take of rhubarb, Castile soap and compound 
extract of colocynth, each half a drachm; mix and divide 
into twenty pills. Take one or two as required. In 
obstinate constipation,- take of rhubarb two scruples, aloes, 
one scruple, extract of nux vomica, four grains; mix, and 
divide into twenty pills. Take one as needed. Habitual 
constipation occasions great distress, and produces grave 
morbid changes in the organs of assimilation, lungs, heart 
and nerves. Take of rhubarb and aloes each, one-half 
drachm; extract of belladonna, three grains; oil of cloves, 
three drops; mix, and make twenty pills. Take one twice 
daily. Or, take of aloes and sulphate of iron, of each, one 
scruple; make twenty pills, and take one twice a day. 
Cascara Sagrada lozenges, two at bedtime, are also most 
effectual. Or, take of Epsom salt, four ounces, dilute 
sulphuric acid, four drachms, sulphate of iron, sixty grains, 
water, two pints; mix, and take a tablespoonful before 
breakfast. A most useful prescription for women habitually 
constipated. Oxgall sometimes is invaluable, as follows: 
Oxgall, thirty grains, willow charcoal, pulverized, sixty 
grains, solid extract nux vomica, five grains; mix, make 
thirty-six pills. One at bedtime. But better than to take 
medicines every day or two will be the use of am injection 
of warm water, white soap, salt and molasses; sweet or 
castor oil, or glycerine may be added. A suppository of 
soap is less disagreeable to some persons, and will generally 
act well. It is made by cutting a piece of good yellow soap 
to the shape, and rather less than the size of the last joint 
of the little finger. Dip it in castor oil, or olive oil, or 
lard, and introduce it within the rectum. But after all, 
rational attention should be paid to diet, exercise, bathing, 
massage, accompanied by regularity in going to stool to 
solicit movements.

Consumption. Consumption may begin after a severe 
acute bronchitis or broncho-pneumonia, or more gradually, 
with an apparently slight hacking cough, or with a 
hemorrhage, or with dyspepsia and general debility. In- 
creasing, in most cases slowly, the pectoral and constitu- 
tional disorder becomes developed. We have, then, pains 
in the chest, frequent and severe cough, hemorrhage 
occasionally, and pallor, hectic fever with bright flush of 
cheek, emaciation, arrest of menstruation in the female, 
night sweats and diarrhoea, lastly death, mostly by ex- 
haustion, but sometimes by suffocation. The spirits of the 
patients are apt to be cheerful, even hopeful of life almost 
to the last. In advanced consumption, the cheeks are hol- 
low, the bones prominent, the skin arid, the nose sharpened 
and drawn, the eyes sunken, there is a most afflicting cough, 
sore throat, difficult deglutition, and feeble, whispering 
voice, or entire extinction of the voice. Consumption is 
certainly one of the most destructive of diseases. About 
one-fourth of all deaths occurring in the human family 
during adult life is caused by it, and nearly one-half of 
the entire population at some time in life acquires it. It 
has been proven beyond a doubt that a living germ, called 
the tubercle bacillus, is the cause and the only cause of 
consumption. It does not seem necessary to state the facts 
upon which this assertion is based, for the observation first 
made by Robert Koch in 1882 has been confirmed so often 
and so completely, that it now constitutes one of the most 
absolutely demonstrated facts in medicine. When the living 
germs find their way into the lungs, they multiply there, if 
favorable conditions for their growth exist, and produce 
small new growths or nodules (tubercles) which tend to 
soften. The discharge from these softened tubercles, con- 
taining the living germs, are thrown off from the body. 
These discharges constitute, in part, the expectoration. The 

30 



306 The Family Doctor 

germs thus thrown off do not grow outside the living body, 
except under artificial conditions, although they may retain 
their vitality and virulence for long periods of time, even 
when thoroughly dried. As tuberculosis (or consumption) 
can only result from the action of these germs, it follows 
that when the disease is acquired, it must result from receiv- 
ing into the body the living germs that have come from 
some other human being, or animal affected with the disease. 
It has been abundantly established that the disease may be 
transmitted by meat or milk ftom the tubercular animals. 
The milk glands in milch cows often become affected with 
the disease when their lungs are involved, and the milk 
from such animals may contain the living germs, and is 
capable of producing the disease. Among stall-fed dairy 
cows, twenty or thirty per cent, are sometimes found to be 
'affected with the disease. Tubercular animals are also 
frequently killed for food; their flesh sometimes contains the 
germs, and if not thoroughly cooked, is capable of trans- 
mitting the disease. Boiling the milk, or thoroughly cooking 
the meat destroys the germs. 

Consumption is commonly produced by breathing air in 
which living germs are suspended as dust. The material 
which is coughed up, sometimes in large quantities, by 
persons suffering from consumption, contains these germs 
often in enormous numbers. This material, when expecto- 
rated, frequently lodges where it afterward dries, as on the 
streets, floors, carpets, clothing, handkerchiefs, etc. After 
drying, in one way or another, it is very apt to become 
pulverized and float in the air as dust. The observations 
made by prominent physicians have shown that where there 
are cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, under ordinary con- 
ditions, the dust surrounding them often contains the 
tubercle bacilli and persons inhaling the air in which this 
dust is suspended may be taking in the living germs. How- 



The Family Doctor 307 

ever, the breath of tuberculous persons, and the moist 
sputum, received in proper cups, are not elements of danger, 
but only the dried and pulverized sputum. The breath and 
moist sputum are free from danger, because the germs are 
not dislodged from moist surfaces by currents of air. If all 
discharges were destroyed at the time of exit from the body, 
the greatest danger of communication from man to man 
would be removed. It is a well known fact that some per- 
sons, and especially the members of certain families, are 
particularly liable to consumption, and this liability can be 
transmitted from parents to children. So marked and so 
frequent is this liability, and so frequent is the development 
of the disease in particular families, that the affection has 
long been considered hereditary. We now know that con- 
sumption can only be caused by the entrance of the germ 
into the body, and that this transmitted liability simply 
rendered the individual a more easy prey to the living 
germs when once they had gained entrance. The frequent 
occurrence of several cases of consumption in a family, 
is then to be explained, not on the supposition that the disease 
itself has been inherited, but that it has been produced after 
birth by transmission directly from some affected individual. 
Hygienic management is decidedly more important to 
the consumptive than medicine. An eminent physician has 
well laid down the following precepts: "A supply of pure 
and fresh air for respiration is constantly required by the 
consumptive patient. Daily exercise in the open air is 
imperatively demanded by the tuberculous patient. It is 
important to secure for the patient a uniform, sheltered, 
temperate and mild climate, about 6o° and a range of not 
more than io° or 15 , where, also, the soil is dry and the 
drinking water pure and not hard. The dress of the con- 
sumptive ought to be of such a kind as to equalize and 
retain the temperature of the body. The hours of rest 



308 The Family Doctor 

should extend from sunset to sunrise. Indoor or sedentary 
occupation must be suspended, but outdoor employment in 
the fresh air has been and may be advantageous. Cleanli- 
ness of the body is a special point to be attended to in the 
hygienic treatment of consumption. Marriage of consump- 
tive females for the sake of arresting disease by pregnancy, 
is morally wrong and physically mischievous. If the con- 
sumption is not inherited, the question of prevention 
resolves itself principally, into the avoidance of tubercular 
meat and milk, and the destruction of the discharges, 
especially the sputum of consumptive individuals. Wooden 
or pasteboard cups with covers should always be at hand for 
the reception of the sputum. These cups should be thrown, 
at least once a day, with their contents, into the fire. Or 
the spittle should be caught in earthen or glass dishes con- 
taining a solution of one part of corrosive sublimate and 
.1,000 parts of water. No one should sleep in a room 
occupied by a person suspected of having consumption. 
The living rooms of a consumptive patient should have as 
little furniture as practicable. Hangings should be 
especially avoided. The use of carpets, rugs, etc., ought 
always to be avoided. Rooms in private houses that are 
occupied by phthisical patients should from time to time be 
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and this should always 
be done after they are. vacated, before they are again 
occupied by other individuals. The eating utensils of a 
person suspected of having consumption should be 
thoroughly washed* as soon after eating as possible, using 
boiling water for the purpose. The unwashed clothing of 
consumptive patients should not be mingled with similar 
clothing of other persons. The bowel discharges of a con- 
sumptive patient with diarrhoea should be caught in a vessel 
containing corrosive sublimate one part, water 1,000 parts. 
Mothers suspected of having consumption should not nurse 



The Family Doctor 309 

their offspring. Household pets (animals or birds) are quite 
susceptible to tuberculosis; therefore they should not be ex- 
posed to persons afflicted with consumption. Also, all 
household pets suspected of having consumption should 
not be kept, but destroyed at once, otherwise they 
may' give it to human beings. It is then, very important 
that the people should have a full knowledge of the fact 
that every consumptive person may be a source of actual 
danger to his associates, if the discharges from the lung 
are not immediately destroyed or rendered harmless, and 
also that the rooms that are occupied by phthisical persons 
should be thoroughly disinfected. Although no specific has 
as yet been discovered which will cure consumption, yet 
many cases are on record which have recovered, or at least, 
the disease has been arrested. Cod liver oil, whiskey, 
quinine and iron should never be omitted. They always do 
good. 

When the expectoration is copious and fluid, and there are 
night sweats and general exhaustion, the following pre- 
scription should be taken: Take of beechwood creosote 
one drachm, syrup of hypophosphites compound, three 
ounces; mix, and take a teaspoonful three times a day after 
meals. This prescription, even when taken early, has 
repeatedly arrested the disease. Expectorants and cough 
mixtures require discretion in their use; however, should the 
cough be troublesome, take the following: Syrup of wild 
cherry, and syrup of lactucarium, each two fluid ounces; 
mix; take a dessertspoonful or two at night, or one or two 
teaspoonfuls in the daytime. Should there occur any 
hemorrhage from the lungs \ the patient ought to be kept in 
bed, with the shoulders somewhat raised, and only iced 
milk and beef essence, or beef tea should be given for food. 
The popular remedy of holding salt in the mouth may be of 
some temporary use. Slowly melting and swallowing ice 



310 The Family Doctor 

will probably do more good. Gallic acid in ten grain doses 
every two or three hours is a very effective remedy. Change 
of climate is often proposed for the benefit of the consump- 
tive. In selecting this, equability and dryness are more 
important than warmth. That climate which allows the 
patient the greatest number of days out of doors will be the 
best. Minnesota, and other places near Lake Superior, 
agree extremely well with some, in the early, but not so well 
in the later stages of the disease. Of southern localities, 
Florida (best of all, its central pine lands) presents an 
especially equable, almost maritime, climate. Santa Barbara 
and San Diego in Southern California are also much recom- 
mended for the colder half of the year. 

Diarrhoea. Diarrhoea may be a salutary process, or an 
ailment serious enough to endanger life. Mucous discharges 
occur i«i inflammation of the bowels and in many cases of 
summer diarrhoea. Bilious passages occur in cholera 
morbus, serous or rice water, in Asiatic cholera, bloody 
discharges in dysentery. In its treatment, an important 
point is that in many cases it should not be abruptly checked ; 
in some cases not interfered with at all. When the motion 
is preceded by severe griping pain, ceasing with the 
evacuation of the acrid and offensive matter, take a table- 
spoonful of the following after each motion: Prepared 
chalk, two drachms, tincture of catechu, two drachms, 
laudanum, 40 drops, cinnamon water, four ounces. When 
the motions are loose and copious, take of laudanum, one 
d-achm, dilute sulphuric acid, two drachms, infusion of log- 
wood, four ounces; mix, take a tablespoonful four or six 
times a day. When it is accompanied with cramps, take a 
teaspoonful of the following every hour until relieved: 
Spirits of chloroform, half an ounce, tincture capsicum, one 
drachm, syrup of ginger, two ounces. When the diarrhoea 
is chronic and hemorrhagic, take 'of powdered gum arabic, 



The Family Doctor 3 1 1 

one and one-half ounces, oil of turpentine, two ounces, 
water, three ounces, simple syrup enough to make twelve 
ounces; mix, and take a teaspoonful every three hours.

Dropsy. Take of bruised juniper berries, mustard seed, 
and ginger, each half an ounce, bruised horseradish and 
parsley root, each an ounce, sound old cider, a quart; infuse. 
Dose, a wineglassful three times a day. 

Dysentery. Rest is important. The diet must be bland, 
as ricewater, arrowroot, or other farinacea; beef tea. When 
thirst is intense, iced ice water; infusion of slippery elm bark 
may be used as a drink. At the very start, a dose of castor 



312 The Family Doctor 

oil with 10 or 15 drops of laudanum will do very well, and 
follow with these pills: Blue mass and powder of ipecac of 
each, 12 grains; mix, and divide into 12 pills. Take one 
every three hours. Or, take of camphor, 18 grains; ipecac, 
6 grains; opium, 3 grains; mix, and divide into 12 pills. 
Take one every three or four hours. When astringents are 
needed, a good pill is the following: Acetate of lead, 12 
grains; opium 3 grains. Mix, and make twelve pills, and 
take one every three hours. Or, take of Dover's powder, 1 
drachm; tannin T /z drachm; mix, and divide into twelve 
powders. Take one every four or five hours. Five grains 
of bismuth may also be added to each dose. The tincture 
of witch-hazel in two to five drops, doses every two hours, 
may be taken when the discharges are bloody. Should they 
be bloody and slimy, use the following: Take of corrosive 
sublimate, 1 grain; distilled water, )/ 2 pint. Take a tea- 
spoonful every hour or two. Injections are very important 
in dysentery. Two or four ounces of flaxseed tea with one 
or two ounces of starch,^thin enough to be drawn into a small 
syringe, with 20 drops of laudanum, should be injected into 
the bowel. For children use the following: Take of castor 
oil, 1 drachm; powdered gum arabic, 20 grains; laudanum, 
4. drops; simple syrup, 1 drachm; orange flower water, 6 
drachms ; mix, and give a teaspoonful every three hours. 

Dyspepsia. It is generally caused by too much food or 
too little food; imperfect mastication, and hurry in eating; 
too little exercise; too much fatigue; excessive study or 
emotional excitement ;• inordinate use of ardent spirits, opium, 
tobacco, coffee, or of medicine out of place. The patient 
feels his stomach all the time, though not always in pain. 
The mouth is clammy, or has a sour or bitter taste. The 
complexion is more or less sallow. The bowels are costive. 
There is heartburn, waterbrash, hypochondria, palpitation 
of the heart, etc. 



The Family Doctor 313 

In the treatment of this affection, correct diet is the most 
important. The meals should be regular, and with sufficient 
time allowed. Beef, mutton, chicken, turkey, stale bread, 
crackers. Exercise in the open air is important, as is also 
bathing. The medical treatment needs tonics, laxatives, 
and antacids. The following prescriptions will be found 
quite effective: Take' of compound tincture of gentian, 
tincture of rhubarb, each 2 ounces. Mix; take two tea- 
spoonfuls before meals. 

Or, take of dilute muriatic acid 2 drachms; pepsin, 4 
drachms; syrup of orange peel, 2 ounces; water 6 ounces. 
Mix, and take half tablespoonful with every meal. 

Or, take of elixir quinine, iron and arsenic, 4 ounces; take 
a teaspoonful after each meal. 

Or, take of subnitrate of bismuth, 320 grains; tincture 
of nux vomica, 3 drachms ; mucilage of gum arabic, 4 ounces. 
Mix, and take a teaspoonful three times a day. 

Where there is much nervous debility, anaemia, and partic- 
ularly in cases of long standing, use the following pills.: 
Take of pill of carbonate of iron, 2 scruples; sulphate of 
quinine, 1 scruple; alcoholic extract of nux vomica, 5 grains; 
Mix, and divide into 20 pills, and take one thrice daily. 

Epilepsy. Several great men have suffered from this 
disease: Caesar, Mahomet, Petrarch, Newton, Peter the 
Great, Napoleon, Byron. Hereditary transmission of this 
disease is common. Intemperance, venereal excess and self 
abuse, blows on the head, and fright, are among the most 
frequent exciting causes. During the attack, when habitual, 
little or nothing is to be done. Place the patient so that he 
cannot strike his head or limbs against anything hard, loosen 
the clothing about the neck to favor free respiration and 
circulation, and insure fresh air about the patient; that is 
all. The inhalation of five drops of nitrite of amyl upon a 
cloth is said to ward off an attack. So simple an expedient 



314 The Family Doctor 

as pulling the great toe is also said to often arrest an attack. 
To break up the recurrence of the fits is the problem for 
which a vast number of remedies have been tried. The 
preference, however, is given to the bromide of potassium 
and ammonium, 10 grains of each, three times a day. The 
following is the prescription largely used in his practice by 
the celebrated Brown-Sequard: Take of iodide of potassium, 
1 drachm; bromide of potassium, 1 ounce; bromide of am- 
monium, 2^2 drachms; bicarbonate of potassium, 2 scruples; 
tincture of columbo, 1 fluid ounce; water, 5 fluid ounces; 
dissolve. Dose, a teaspoonful with little water, before each 
meal. If the case is very bad, three teaspoonfuls are also 
taken at bedtime. 

Facial Neuralgia and Hysteria. Take of croton 
chloral hydrate, 2 drachms; glycerine, 2 ounces; water, 2 
ounces. Mix; take a teaspoonful three times a day. If 
symptoms are urgent, take a teaspoonful every two hours 
until pain is relieved. 

Frost Bite : Chilblain. Gangrenous destruction of 
part, especially of toes, not infrequently follows actual 
congealation. When the feet or other parts have been so 
chilled as to be almost frozen, gradual warming — for in- 
stance, at first rubbing them with snow — is proper as a 
prevention of frosting. In its treatment, cooling ointments 
as Goulard's cerate or lotions of lead water, may be first 
indicated, and then astringents, as alum water, infusion of 
oak bark, creosote ointment, etc. Cabbage leaves are a 
popular domestic remedy for chilblains. 

Frost Bitten Fingers and Toes. Take of dilute 
nitric acid and peppermint water, equal parts. Mix; paint 
surface. After three or four days, the skin becomes dark, 
the epidermis is shed, and a healthy skin appears under- 
neath. 

Gout greatly resembles rheumatism. It is caused by 



The Family Doctor 315 

high living, with indolent habits. An excess of animal 
foocf with scanty exercise will produce it. Strong wines 
and malt liquors much increase the tendency. Weak wines 
do not seem to have the same effect. Hereditary transmission 
of the gouty constitution is very common. Premonition of 
a gouty spell is often witnessed for some days, with symptoms 
of indigestion, flatulence, acidity, constipation, and palpita- 
tion of the heart. Then a joint becomes very painful, swol- 
len, red and tender; in the majority of cases, the great toe 
is affected. Other toes, the fingers, ankle, wrist, or knee 
may be attacked; the large joints least often. The suffer- 
ing with the gouty inflammation is often very intense, but 
its duration is not commonly more than a few days at a time. 
In treating this affection, cold locally applied should be ab- 
solutely avoided. More than one death has occurred from 
this, by repulsion of the disorder to the heart, stomach or 
brain. Laudanum may be safely applied to the part, by 
wetting a piece of linen or muslin with it, laying it on the 
painful joint, and covering it with oil silk. Oil of horse- 
chestnut has also been recommended. Either of the follow- 
ing prescriptions will give relief : Take of wine of colchicum 
root, 1 fluid drachm; Husband's magnesia, 1 drachm; pep- 
permint water, 4 fluid ounces. Mix; take a tablespoonful 
thrice daily. Or, take of wine of colchicum root, 1 fluid 
drachm; bicarbonate of potash and Rochelle salts, each 2^ 
drachms; peppermint water, 4 fluid ounces. Mix; take a 
tablespoonful thrice daily. Or, take of carbonate of potash 
and nitrate of potash, each 2^ drachms; water, 8 fluid 
ounces; dissolve. Take a tablespoonful thrice daily. Regula- 
tion of the diet is of primary importance. But it should not 
be too low, especially when the patient's habits have been 
those of a free liver. Exercise in proportion to strength 
should be recommended. The state of the skin, as well as 
of the bowels is important. Change of air, traveling, and 



3 16 The Family Doctor 

mineral waters are generally useful during the intervals 
between the attacks. Alkaline springs and baths, sUth as 
those of Vichy in France, Ems in Germany, or Gettysburg in 
Pennsylvania, have an especial reputation as a prophylactic 
against gout. 

Healing Ointment. Take of vaseline, citrine oint- 
ment, each one ounce, subnitrate of bismuth, one drachm; 
mix, apply. Useful in various ulcers, old sores, etc. 

Heartburn. Calcined magnesia, or bicarbonate of 
sodium will give temporary relief. Steep gentian rcot and 
horseradish in good whisky enough to cover, and use in 
tablespoonful doses; or, take of tincture of nux vomica, two 
drachms, compound tincture of cinchona, two ounces; mix, 
and take a teaspoonful three times a day. 

Heatstroke. It is almost always, in the case of heat 
exhaustion, those who have been fatigued by exertion in the 
sun or shade who are overcome. Drinking largely of cold 
water when thus exhausted, increases the danger. Intem- 
perate persons are particularly liable to heatstroke. 
Genuine sunstroke is commonly sudden. Falling uncon- 
scious, the head is very hot, the temporal arteries distended, 
the breathing is apt to be snoring, the pulse full, generally 
rapid, but in few instances slow. In severe cases, con- 
vulsions may precede death. In heatstroke, almost equal 
suddenness marks the attack. Unconsciousness is less com- 
plete, and without snoring of breathing; the whole condition 
resembles fainting rather than apoplexy. For heat apoplexy 
cupping or leeching the back of the neck or behind the ears 
should generally be the first remedy, after the application of 
ice or iced water freely to the head. The head and 
shoulders should be kept raised. A purgative injection 
should also be administered, and mustard plasters applied to 
the lower limbs. 

Heat exhaustion requires quite different treatment, in 



The Family D oat or 317 

part, at least. Cold water or ice should be applied to the 
head and body, and then mustard plasters to the spine, 
stomach and limbs, in turn. Bleeding should be avoided. 
If syncopal symptoms be decided, ammonia may be for a 
few minutes applied to the nostrils, and if the patient can 
swallow, aromatic spirits of ammonia may be given by the 
mouth, ten drops every fifteen minutes at first, gradually in- 
creasing the interval. 

Hydrophobia. When individuals are bitten by animals, 
such as dogs, cats, wolves and foxes, which are mad, or 
suspected of madness, and the necessary measures are not 
immediately adopted, the patient usually becomes affected 
with that peculiar and terrible disease, known as hydro- 
phobia. The disease, as a rule, occurs oftenest within three 
months after being bitten, rarely after the sixth month. The 
more numerous the bites, and the greater their gravity, the 
earlier do the symptoms appear. They manifest themselves 
earlier in children than in old people. When no preventive 
measures are adopted, at least half, perhaps two-thirds of 
persons bitten, escape. The immunity may be due partly to 
the bites being inflicted through clothes, partly to individual 
insusceptibility, which has been found to exist in animals as 
well as in man. However, the statistics prove that the bites 
on the face give a mortality of 80 per cent, and those in the 
hands of 67 per cent. These parts being uncovered, the 
virus is directly deposited in the tissues, and is quickly 
absorbed. The most cases of hydrophobia occur during the 
spring and fall months. When a person has been bitten by 
a mad animal, he should have his wounds immediately 
attended to. They should be made to bleed as much as pos- 
sible. Forcible suction will aid in removing the poison, 
and ligation with any kind of bandage above the part, will 
retard the absorption of it. Cauterization should never be 
neglected. A red hot iron or caustic potash are the best 



318 The Family Doctor 

caustics. Every portion of the wound should be cauterized, 
and the parts dressed with carbolic acid and iodoform oint- 
ment. Lunar caustic is too light a caustic and is ineffectual. 
The next thing to do is to go to the nearest Pasteur institute 
and take an anti-hydrophobic treatment. This treatment 
was discovered by L. Pasteur of Paris, after five years of 
study and experimentation. It consists in injecting under 
the skin, once or twice a day for fifteen days, a virus 
attenuated and prepared according to the rules and teaching 
of its discoverer. This treatment is only prophylactic, that 
is, it will prevent the patient from having hydrophobia, and 
is powerless when the symptoms of the disease have once 
made their appearance. Hence the necessity of early treat- 
ment. These institutes have been established in every 
part of the world. The principal one, in Paris, has already 
treated eight thousand cases, and all successfully. In this 
country, we have two of these institutes, one in New York, 
directed by Dr. Paul Gibier, and one in Chicago, founded 
and directed by Dr. A. Lagorio. Both men have had a large 
experience in the subject in question, and are highly 
qualified to treat these cases. 

Influenza or " Grippe." It is reported as having been 
quite fatal in France in 131 1 and 1403. In 1570 it also 
prevailed, and in 1557 spread over Europe, and extended to 
America. It occurred again in 1729, 1743, 1775, 1782, 
1833, 1837, with notable violence. In the United States, 
one of the most remarkable epidemics for extent, was that 
of 1843. Another was that of 1872, following nearly the 
course of the epizootic among horses of the latter part of 
that year. The last epidemic (1890) has been a remarkable 
one for its extent, invading all Europe and the United 
States. Mild cases require housing and little more. The 
following prescriptions will be found excellent: Take of 
antipyrin, eighteen grains, Dover's powder," twelve grains, 



The Family Doctor 319 

powdered extract valerian, three grains; mix, and divide 
into six capsules. Take one every two hours. If there be a 
tight cough, take the following: Take of muriate of 
ammonia, thirty grains, deodorized tincture of opium, one 
drachm, syrup of senega snakeroot, one-half ounce, distilled 
water, one ounce, syrup of balsam tolu enough to make three 
fluid ounces; mix, and take a teaspoonful every two hours. 
Great prostration, especially in old people, may call for 
support by quinine and stimulants, as hot whisky punches. 

Ingrowing" Nail. A very common and troublesome 
affection, which most usually occurs by the side of the great 
toe, due to constant pressure from the use of tight shoes. 
The objects for its treatment are to remove the irritation 
caused by the nail, and reduce the swelling of the soft 
parts. In most cases, if the nail, having been well softened 
by soaking in warm water, is shaved as thin as possible with 
a bit of glass, the pain and irritation may easily be allayed 
by rest for a day or two, with fomentations and poultices. 
A good way to remove the nail is to wedge some cotton 
under the free margin of the nail, placing over it a piece of 
adhesive plaster with a hole cut in it the size and shape of 
the nail to be removed, then moisten the end of a pencil 
of lunar caustic and apply it to the part to be removed, 
taking care not to touch any other portion. The next day 
the nail will have assumed a black or brown appearance. 
Upon raising the nail, it will be found to have become 
separated from the subjacent tissue, and all there is required 
to complete the cure is to clip off the dead portion. 

Lumbricoid or Round Worms. These worms are 
from five to fifteen inches in length, tapering to a point at 
each end — very common in children. We infer that a child 
suffers from worms when we hear that it picks its nose, 
grinds its teeth at night, has a voracious and capricious ap- 
petite, looks pinched and thin at the bridge of the nose, and 



320 The Family Doctor 

dark around the mouth, has a tumid belly, dark rings round 
the eyes, is often sick, and complaining of itching at the 
anus. Santonine is the most effectual remedy for these 
worms. It requires care in its use, however, producing 
serious- vomiting, prostration, and nervous symptoms in 
overdoses. A child should take not more than half a grain 
once or twice daily; an adult about three grains. It is best 
given at night, and followed in the morning by a dose of 
castor oil. The process may be repeated for a night or 
two until the canal seems cleaned. 

Mastitis, or commonly known as inflammation of the 
breast, may result from blows or other external injuries, but 
it most often occurs during lactation. The following is said 
to be a successful method of treating it: Take of carbonate 
of ammonia, 2 drachms; boiling water, 8 ounces; saturate 
in this solution a flannel bandage three inches wide and two 
feet long, and apply to breast, covering with oil silk. Use 
hot as can be borne, and renew every two or three hours. 
Relief will be derived from first application, and will prevent 
the formation of matter. 

Nasal Catarrh. The chief characteristics are langour, 
lassitude, debility; headache with a sense of tightness across 
the forehead; excessive purulent discharge from the nostrils, 
or tickling down the throat, which creates hawking, or it 
may dry up and become impacted in the nostrils. Deafness 
may be caused and hoarseness. If it invades the bronchial 
tubes, there is increased hawking, cough, emaciation, and 
discoloration of the skin, due to imperfect oxygenation of 
the blood. It is a loathsome disease, and liable to give rise 
to many other affections, as epilepsy, consumption, etc. 
Predisposition to nasal obstruction appears to have, in some 
persons, an anatomical origin; in a symmetrical growth of 
the bony structure of the nasal cavities. Usually, however, 
chronic nasal catarrh is the result of repeated or prolonged 



The Family Doctor 321 

exposure to changes of temperature, and especially cold and 
damp, such as abound in our American climate. In treat- 
ing this affection, full information must be had about the 
constitutional history of the patient. If there is a syphilitic 
cause, iodide of potassium in five or ten grain doses three 
times a day, or iodide of iron pills must be taken. Scrofulous 
subjects will be benefited by taking the iodide of iron and 
cod liver oil. Local treatment, however, is not to be neg- 
lected. The parts should be cleansed and disinfected. The 
nasal cavities should be douched. For this purpose, many 
sorts of instruments have been invented, which generally 
can be gotten in any drugstore. For simple cleansing, a 
solution of common salt in warm water (a teaspoonful in a 
pint) will be very suitable. Other lotions are employed, 
containing some of the following substances: Alum, borax, 
boracic acid, chloride of ammonium, chlorate of potassium, 
tar water, corrosive sublimate, chlorinated soda, iodoform, 
carbolic acid, glycerine, etc. Another mode of application to 
the nostrils is with the atomizer. Many prefer the insufflation 
of powders, as tannin, bismuth. Excellent snuffs are pul- 
verized horse chestnut, boracic acid, chlorate of potash. In 
obstinate cases, resort may be had to a surgeon for the re- 
moval of some of the obstructive masses. Some of the fol- 
lowing prescriptions may be tried: Carbolic acid, one grain; 
borax and bicarbonate of soda each two grains; glycerine, 
a fluid drachm; water enough to make a fluid ounce. Mix; 
to be sprayed into the nostrils. Or, take of powdered gum 
arabic, myrrh and bloodroot, equal parts, and use as snuff. 
Or, take of powdered golden seal, 40 grains; camphor, 15 
grains; carbolic acid, 15 grains; common salt, 1 ounce. 
Mix; snuff. Or, thymol, 5 grains; alcohol and glycerine, 
each half an ounce. Mix, and apply locally with cotton. 
Or, porphyrized iodoform, 1 drachm; camphor, 1 drachm, 
and gum arabic 2 drachms. Mix, and use locally. Inhala- 
tions of menthol will also afford relief. Take of pure iodine, 

21 



322 The Family Doctor 

5 grains: iodide of potassium, 2 scruples; glycerine, 1% 
ounces. Mix, apply locally with brush twice a day. Solu- 
tions of permanganate of potash are very efficient when the 
nasal secretions are foetid. (See also Catarrh.) 

Nervous Prostration. Take of dilute phosphoric 
acid, 1 ounce; elixir calisaya, 4 ounces; elixir valerianate 
of ammonia, 2 ounces; glycerine, 3 ounces; sherry wine, 6 
ounces. Mix, and take half or one tablespoonful three or 
four times a day. When accompanied with dyspepsia, use 
the following: Saccharated pepsin, 3 drachms; bromide of 
sodium, 1 ounce; fluid extract of coca, 2 ounces; glycerine, 
2 ounces. Take a teaspoonful three or four times a day. In 
overworked, ansemic and broken down persons: Take of 
phosphate of lime, of iron, each one scruple. Divide into 
twenty powders. Take one three times a day. 

Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy. Take of 
spirits of chloroform, 6 drarchms; deodorized tincture of 
opium, % drachm; fluid extract of ginger, one drachm; spirits 
of camphor, ^ drachm; tincture of cardamom comp. , 1 
ounce. Mix; take a teaspoonful as required. 

Night Terrors. A child who has gone to bed apparently 
well, and -who has slept soundly for a short time, awakes 
suddenly in great terror, and with a loud and piercing cry. 
It is a fruitful source of anxiety and distress to parents. 
Fortunately, this condition, alarming and distressing as it 
is, does not prove any disease of the brain. Most frequently 
those children are of a very nervous temperament, and suffer 
more or less with difficult dentition, indigestion, constipa- 
tion, or irritation of the bowels. The treatment of these 
cases comprises in the first place, kindness and forbearance 
toward the little sufferer. These terrors will be but increased 
by harshness, while soothing and gentleness will do much to 
dispel them. During the attack, the child should be at once 
gently lifted up from the bed, and either carried for a few 



The Family Doctor 323 

minutes, or laid down in a different position. Washing the 
face softly with a rag dipped in cool or cold water may 
arouse thoroughly. If any medicine be suitable, it will be 
a teaspoonful or two of camphor water. Care is needed to 
prevent the attacks. Violent exercise and mental excitement 
are almost apt to bring them on, also indigestion or constipa- 
tion. The bowels should, however, be kept open by rhubarb 
or senna, etc. The compound syrup of the phosphate of iron 
given in teaspoonful doses three times a day will do great 
good. To promote tranquil sleep, some one should remain 
with the child, if timid, for awhile after he goes to bed; or 
a light should be kept burning low. A child liable to night 
terrors ought to be allowed to finish its morning sleep un- 
disturbed. Abundance of sleep is a sedative to an over ex- 
cited brain. Neglect of such precautions may convert a 
mere transitory functional disturbance into a serious attack 
of brain disease. 

Piles. The plethoric constitution is the most liable to 
them, especially with sedentary habits. Long standing or 
sitting upon hard seats, over-stimulating diet, misuse of 
purgatives, and the constipation of the bowels, always pre- 
dispose to piles. The bowels must be regulated, neither 
over purged nor allowed to be costive; a soluble state is the 
most desirable. Magnesia is irritant to piles, and so are the 
saline cathartics. Rhubarb, sulphur and senna are the laxa- 
tives most approved for hemorrhoidal cases. A teaspoonful 
of compound licorice powder at bedtime will gently open 
the bowels. On retiring to bed at night, inject the fol- 
lowing into the rectum: Take of fluid extract of hamamelis, 
three drachms, fluid extract of golden seal, two drachms, 
sweet oil, two ounces; mix. The following will also be 
found useful: Powder of galls, two drachms, opium, ten 
grains, lard, one ounce; mix, and apply. Or, take of ex- 
tract of belladonna, one drachm, spermaceti ointment, one 



324 The Family Dodo? 

ounce; mix, use as ointment for painful piles. Or, take of 
extract of belladonna, one drachm, iodoform, one-half 
drachm, sugar of lead, one scruple, vaseline, one ounce; 
mix, and apply to piles three or four times a day. The piles 
should be bathed in cold water just before each application, 
and the bowels kept freely open with a gentle purgative, in 
painful hemorrhoids. For bleeding piles, use the following: 
Take of tannic acid, twenty grains, water, six ounces; dis- 
solve, and inject (cooled with ice) into the rectum. After 
each morning stool, the rectum should be injected with 
warm water, or if great debility exists, with beef tea, and 
permitted to remain half an hour longer. As a palliation 
and often curative remedy for local and internal piles, ham- 
amelis is very superior to all other remedies. 

Rheumatism. There are two forms; first, the acute 
articular rheumatism, or rheumatic fever; second, chronic 
rheumatism. The acute rheumatism is characterized by high 
fever with severe inflammation of several of the larger and 
smaller joints, which mostly, one after another, become 
swollen, red, hot, tender and painful. The shoulders, 
wrists, knees and ankles are most frequently so affected. 
Absolute rest in bed is necessary, and the joints gently 
rubbed with a liniment containing one ounce of laudanum 
and three ounces of camphorated oil, then covered with 
cotton batting. For internal use, five grain doses of salicine 
every three hours is a most valuable remedy. Salicylic acid 
is also a very effective remedy in ten grain doses every two 
hours until five or six doses are taken, and afterward the 
same amount three or four times a day. Salicylate of sodium 
is probably better suited in every case for its being less dis- 
agreeable and more soluble. Its doses must be about two- 
thirds larger than the salicylic acid. A ten grain Dover 
powder at night will help to give great relief. Either of the 
following prescriptions will be found very useful in all acute 



The Family Doctor 325 

cases: Take of salicylic acid, three drachms, bicarbonate 
of potassium, six drachms, water, two fluid ounces; mix; 
dose, a teaspoonful every three hours. Or, take of salicylic 
acid, three drachms, glycerine and water each two fluid 
ounces; mix; dose, a teaspoonful every four hours. Or, 
take of salicylic acid and acetate of potash each 160 
grains, glycerine, ten drachms, sweet spirits of nitre, ten 
drachms, water enough to make four ounces; mix; dose, a 
teaspoonful every two hours. We also recommend: 

The Late Dr. Agnew's Prescription. Take a tea- 
spoonful of common baking soda and dissolve in a tumbler- 
ful of cold water; divide into three equal doses and take a 
dose between meals and on retiring. Do not take im- 
mediately before^ or after meals, as soda interferes with 
digestion. In connection with this, bathe once a day in 
warm water in which sal soda has been dissolved. Begin by 
using a teacupful of sal soda to a tubful of water and in- 
crease the quantity of sal soda as the skin will bear it. 
Should the skin smart on being rubbed dry anoint the body 
with a little cocoanut oil. This process has been known to 
cure some of the most obstinate cases of rheumatism. 

Sciatica Liniment. Take of camphor, chloral and oil 
of cajuput, equal parts. Rub externally, and cover with 
cotton batting. 

Take of aconite liniment, belladonna liniment, each two 
drachms, glycerine, two ounces; mix, spread on lint and 
place on thigh. Cover with oil, silk, and bandage the limb. 

Seat Worms. Sulphate of iron, one grain to four 
ounces of water injected up the bowels, removes the worms, 
and an occasional injection of the same will prevent their 
return. 

Sprains. A sprain consists in the sudden and forcible 
stretching of the tendons or ligaments connected with a 
joint. The accident is followed by severe pain and rapid 



326 The Family Doctor 

swelling. It is always troublesome and tedious, and may 
lead to serious results. The treatment should aim at pre- 
venting inflammation, promoting absorption, and restoring 
healthy action. The part should be kept at rest in an 
elevated position, and cold continuously applied. Some- 
times a poultice or a fomentation will be found to give 
most relief, especially if there be much inflammation; 
leeches may also be required. As soon as the acute 
symptoms have subsided, absorption should be promoted by 
systematic rubbing with or without stimulating liniments, or 
by pressure of a well adjusted bandage. Gradually passive 
motion may be begun in order to restore the part 'to its 
proper functions, and the joint may be moderately used. If 
any stiffness remain, warm salt water douches or a visit to 
a thermal spring is often attended with benefit. 

Sore Nipples. Apply a mixture of tannin and 
glycerine, two drachms to the ounce daily during the last 
month of pregnancy. This renders the nipple tough but 
elastic. 

Stomach-ache. Is common in dyspeptics. Carmina- 
tives are appropriate for it. One of the best of these is oil 
of cajuput, five drops at a dose on a lump of sugar; or take 
of spirits of chloroform, compound tincture of cardamoms, 
of each one ounce; mix, and take a teaspoonful three or 
four times a day. 

Sweating of the Feet. Take of hydrate of chloral, 
twenty grains, alcohol, three ounces; mix, bathe the feet 
thoroughly in castile soapsuds. Apply the solution with 
the sponge, and put on socks while feet are wet. 

Tape Worm. It is formed of flat segments, often 
several hundred in number, connected with the head by a 
slender neck. Each segment has male and female organs; 
as those at the tail mature, they are cast off. Some persons 
thus pass six or eight fragments from the bowels in a day. 



The Family Doctor 327 

The whole length of the parasite is from ten to thirty feet. 
The symptoms caused by tapeworm are uneasy sensations in 
the abdomen, and general nervous irritation, lowness of 
spirits, indigestion, irregularity of appetite, and of the 
action of the bowels; itching of the nose and sometimes of 
the anus. The remedies against tapeworm are many, as: 
Oil of turpentine in half ounce or ounce doses will generally 
purge and bring away the worm. The ethereal extract of 
male fern in the dose of a drachm and a half to two 
drachms, is esteemed highly. Powder Kooso in half ounce 
doses mixed with water, given on an empty stomach, is 
almost certain to destroy or remove the parasite. Pumpkin 
seeds plentifully taken on an empty stomach are also quite 
effectual. As immature tapeworms find residence in the 
bodies of animals used for food, and thus get opportunity to 
enter the human alimentary canal, the avoidance of raw or 
undercooked meat is the precept of prophylaxis suggested, 
and confirmed by experience. This applies not only to the 
prevention of tapeworm, but also to that of other parasites, 
especially trichina. Tapeworms are derivable from infected 
beef, even oftener than from pork. 

To Abort a Felon. Apply the following with cloth 
until pain ceases: Take of tincture of iodine, three 
drachms, tincture of aconite, of arnica, of cantharides, of 
each two drachms; mix, and apply. Another method is the 
following: Take a teaspoonful of common salt, roasted in 
a hot stove until all the chlorine gas is thrown off, or is dry 
as can be made. Also a teaspoonful of powdered castile 
soap, add a teaspoonful of Venice turpentine; mix them into 
a poultice, and apply to the felon. Renew the poultice twice 
a day. 

Tonsillitis. Commonly known as quinsy. The symp- 
toms are soreness of the throat in swallowing, with pain of 
one or both tonsils, and fever. A dofe of citrate of magnesia 



328 The Family Doctor 

should be taken at once. Apply externally a poultice of 
flaxseed meal, to which lard and laudanum have been added, 
bathe, when the poultice is changed, with liniment of 
ammonia or soap liniment. Internally the following mix- 
ture will be found very useful: Take of chlorate of potash, 
sixty grains, sweet spirits of nitre, four drachms, tincture of 
guaiac, twelve drachms; mix. Dose for adults, a teaspoon- 
ful every three hours. Shake well before taking, and follow 
with water. The following gargles will be found excellent: 
Take of ammoniated tincture of guaiac, two drachms, com- 
pound tincture of Peruvian bark, two drachms, clarified 
honey, six drachms; mix well and add slowly while shaking, 
water, three ounces, chlorate of potash, one drachm; mix, 
and use as gargle. Or, take of hydrate of chloral, one 
drachm, glycerine, half an ounce, water, one and one-half 
ounces; mix, gargle when there is ulceration of fauces, with 
great swelling and redness and pain extending from throat 
to ear. Or, mix one ounce of bromo-chloralum in eleven 
ounces of water, and gargle. Alum and chlorate potash 
dissolved in water also make good gargles. In chronic 
cases, use gargles of tannin. If the tonsils will remain 
chronically enlarged, and thereby causing considerable in- 
convenience, have them removed by a surgeon. 

In Low Nervous Affections, with languid circulation, 
debility of stomach, take of muriated tincture of iron, two 
drachms, tincture Peruvian bark, two ounces, tincture of 
orange, one and one-half ounces; mix, and take a teaspoon- 
ful three times a day. 

Toothache. Is sometimes purely neuralgic. More often 
it results from exposure of the nerve by the decay of a tooth. 
Again, it may attend inflammation of the jaw, or abscess at 
the root of the tooth affected. For toothache from exposed 
nerve, creosote i s a certain remedy. Insert carefully into 
the hollow a plug of cotton, wrapped over the end of a 



Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 329 

knitting needle, and dipped in pure creosote. If the rattle 
run out into the mouth (which should be avoided if possible) 
rinse it at once with cold water. Oil of cloves, oil of 
cajeput, and laudanum introduced into the hollow of the 
tooth will also generally give relief. 

Waterbrash. Can be relieved by taking a tablespoonful 
of glycerine to half tumblerful of milk. Bicarbonate of 
sodium in scruple doses is also effective. Astringents have 
also been highly recommended. Take of Ammonio-ferric 
alum two scruples, cinnamon water, four ounces; dissolve, 
and take a tablespoonful every two or three hours. 

DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD 

Chicken Pox. This is a contagious but harmless disease 
of childhood, unattended by any constitutional 
disturbance, as a rule, and after running its 
course for a few days ends incomplete recovery. 
Often several children of the same family have 
1 it, one after the other. It affects both sexes 
alike, and all classes indiscriminately. After 
a period of incubation, the length of which is 
doubtful, a number of little red points suddenly 
>appear on the skin, and in the course of 
The Nurse, twenty-four hours each has become a small 
blister, or vesicle, raised above the surface and surrounded by 
a pink areola or zone. The next day more red spots appear, 
which also form blisters and so on for about three or four 
days fresh crops appear, the previous ones attaining a 
maturer stage. The eruption is most abundant on the back 
and front of the body. In about a week the vesicles begin 
to wither and dry up, and in a week or ten days longer the 
scabs fall off, leaving as a rule no scar. 

Treatment. — As a rule, the child need only be kept in the 




330 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

nursery and not in bed all day long; occasionally the little 
patient is restless and feverish, but in most cases it will play 
about as cheerfully as usual and appear to have nothing the 
matter with it. For a few days the child may be kept indoors 
and the diet should be plain and simple. 

Convulsions. Some children are much more liable to 
suffer from convulsions than others, owing to the more impres- 
sionable nature of the nervous system. 

Causes. — Difficulty in teething is a very frequent cause, the 
irritation of the gums affecting the brain ; and when that ir- 
ritation is removed, the convulsions disappear. Indigestible 
articles of food are another very frequent cause; fright may 
cause convulsions, and anything profoundly affecting the 
mother, such as anger, terror, grief, may so act upon her 
milk as to give rise to convulsions in the infant. 

Symptoms. — -Sometimes the convulsions are partial, thus an 
arm may twitch or certain portions of the face. The writer 
recollects being called to a child suffering from partial con- 
vulsions, whose mother, recognizing, from the inflamed 
condition of the gums, that the teething was at fault, took out 
her penknife and scratched the surface, which was really 
just what was required. Again, the convulsion may be general, 
when the muscles of the face, eyes, eyelids and limbs are in 
a violent state of rapid contraction alternating with relaxa- 
tion. Froth may appear at the mouth, and if the tongue has 
been bitten it will be tinged with blood. The head is 
generally thrown back, and the thumbs pressed in upon the 
palms of the hands. 

Treatment. — If the teeth are plainly at fault, the gums must 
be scarified, and three grains of bromide of potassium may 
be given in a little water. If due to some indigestible article 
of diet, then the best thing to do is to get rid of it as soon 
as possible. The writer gave a child that took a very severe 
fit during or immediately after dinner an emetic of mustard 



Diseases of Infancy and ChildJiood 331 

and water, which answered very well. Perhaps a safer emetic 
would be a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wine in tepid water; 
drinks of tepid water being afterward given. This, of 
course, is only to be given if it is thought that some in- 
digestible article of food has given rise to the convulsions, 
and if too long a time has not elapsed since it was swallowed. 
If some hours have elapsed, it will be better to give a tea- 
spoonful of castor oil. The following mixture will be found 
useful ; it may be given to children from one to three years 
old: Bromide of potassium, two drachms; iodide of potas- 
sium, half a drachm; syrup of orange peel, an ounce; water 
to make four ounces. A teaspoonful every three hours, till 
all tendency to twitching of the muscles has passed away. 
Another very useful item of treatment is a warm bath or a 
pack. A sheet should be wrung out of hot water and wrapped 
round the child from the neck downward, and over this 
one or two blankets. The child should remain in this for an 
hour, after which it may be taken out and dried with warm 
towels. Or the child may be immersed in a warm bath up 
to the neck, or put in a tub or hip-bath with as much water 
as can be got into it, so as to cover as much of the body as 
possible. It should remain in this for about fifteen minutes, 
during which cold cloths may be applied to the head. 

Croup. Croup is an inflammatory disease of the larynx, 
or upper part of the windpipe, and occurs in children, being 
very common between two and five years of age. 

Symptoms. — It is attended by very noisy inspiration on ac- 
count of the narrowed condition of the glottis preventing 
the free entrance of air into the lungs. The child feels as if 
it were going to be choked, and it makes violent efforts 
with the muscles of the chest, so as to increase the supply of 
air within. Croup is a disease in which no delay should take 
place in treatment, as imminent danger may ensue from suf- 
focation. 



332 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

Treatment. — Give the child a warm bath if possible, and 
wring sponges out of hot water, and apply them constantly 
to the throat. Give a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wine every 
fifteen minutes, with drinks of tepid water in between till 
the child vomits. After it has been made sick, or if the 
symptoms appear so mild that an emetic is not given, the 
following mixture will be found Of use: Ipecacuanha wine, 
one drachm; iodide of potassium, one drachm; syrup of 
orange peel, one ounce; water to make four ounces; a tea- 
spoonful to be given every three hours to a child from two 
to five years old. It is not necessary to say that medical aid 
should be sought at once. After an attack, care should be 
taken not to expose the child to draughts; flannel should be 
worn next to the skin, and a comforter wrapped round the 
throat. 

Diarrhoea. The causes of diarrhoea in children being very 
varied, it is necessary, as far as possible, to determine what 
it is in each case; thus, for instance, teething is a very 
frequent cause when it is difficult and accompanied by a 
good deal of irritation. When the tooth is cut, the irritation 
ceases, and the diarrhoea passes away. Again, cold may give 
»rise to diarrhoea, from the impression made upon the nerves 
of the skin. This is frequently seen in children who toss 
the bedclothes off during sleep. Fright may also give rise 
to diarrhoea, and of course, the eating of indigestible articles of 
food will do the same. A frequent cause of diarrhoea in in- 
fants is an overloaded condition of the stomach, or the giving 
of unsuitable articles of diet. 

Treatment. — Diarrhoea in children ought never to be neg- 
lected, as, if allowed to run on from day to day, it weakens 
the child and may pass into inflammation of the bowels, a 
much more serious disorder. If the diet appear to be at fault, 
it must be corrected. Suppose, for instance, that the child, 
previous to the cutting of the teeth, has been given solid 



Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 333 

food, the probability is that it will disagree, and set up ir- 
ritation in the bowels, which will cause diarrhoea. In such 
a case nothing- but milk should be given for food, and a little 
lime water may be added to it with advantage. If the 
diarrhoea has continued for any length of time it is necessary 
to check it at once. For this purpose the compound powder 
of chalk and opium may be given in two grain doses every 
three hours to an infant one year old, or a little chalk mix- 
ture may be given — half to one teaspoonful every four hours 
to a child two or three years old. This may be combined 
with a little opium as follows: Laudanum, four drops; tincture 
of catechu, two drachms; chalk mixture to make two ounces; 
a teaspoonful to be given every four hours. 

Infant's Colic. Take of best magnesia, one drachm, 
aromatic spirit of ammonia, forty drops, tincture of 
assafcetida, a fluid-drachm, essence of peppermint, fifteen 
drops, syrup of gum arabic, a fluid ounce, water enough to 
make four fluid ounces. Dose, teaspoonful. 

Measles. This is a contagious, febrile disorder. It is 
nearly always more or less prevalent in this country, but at 
times it spreads with great rapidity and causes many deaths. 
As a rule, children and young people are attacked, but the 
exemption of adults and older people is probably due to the 
fact that most of them have had the disease in childhood. 
Sometimes people have a second attack. 

Symptoms. — Before the appearance of the rash there are 
some precursory symptoms; the patient feels languid and 
hot, there is shivering, followed by a rise of temperature, a 
quick pulse, thirst, loss of appetite and sickness. The eyes 
become red and watery, and give the patient the appearance 
of having cried; the membrane which lines the nose, throat, 
larynx and trachea is red and swollen, and pours forth a watery 
secretion ; thus the affected person appears to have a severe 
cold, with running from the eyes and nose; hence there is 



334 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

generally much sneezing, with a slightly sore throat and a 
dry, harsh cough. Convulsions occasionally occur in 
children. After these symptoms have lasted three or four 
days the rash appears. It begins in very small papules or 
minute pimples which rapidly multiply, and these run together 
into patches which have a tendency to a horseshoe, or 
crescent shape, while the portions of skin between are of a 
natural color. Commencing on the face and neck, it spreads 
to the arms, then the trunk of the body and gradually reaches 
the lower extremities. When the eruption has disappeared 
the part of the skin affected becomes covered with a dry 
scurf. 

Complications are liable to occur. Convulsions at the com- 
mencement are usually without danger; if they come on at 
the end of the disease they may lead to a fatal issue. In- 
flammation of the lungs is very common in measles, and 
bronchitis, which may prove fatal to young children, adds 
to the danger. 

Treatment. — The child must be kept in bed. The room 
should be airy and well ventilated, but the patient must not 
be exposed to draughts. All offensive excreta and dirty 
linen should be removed and disinfected. A fire should be 
kept burning and the temperature should be about 6o° or 65° 
Fahrenheit. The blinds should be kept down on account of 
the patient's eyes, and he should lie with his back to the 
light. In all cases it is advisable to give the patient a hot 
bath at the very onset of the disease; then dry the surface 
of the body and put the child to bed directly. All sources 
of annoyance and irritation and all noises should be avoided. 
Food of the simplest nature should be given. Milk, milk 
and water, chicken broth, beef tea and toast and water may 
be given. When the fever subsides a small piece of chicken 
or fried sole may be given, toast or bread and butter, with a 
fresh egg may also be given, and, as the tongue cleans and 
the appetite returns, the patient may be allowed to resume 



Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 335 

his ordinary diet. Although children generally recover 
rapidly, yet there are times when much debility ensues and 
the general health becomes impaired, although the fever has 
quite left. Such children as are in bad health are liable to 
lumps or glandular swellings of the neck and under the jaws, 
or they may remain weak for a long time. In these cases 
chemical food may be given with advantage; Parrish's Syrup 
is another name for this. It may be given in doses of five to 
ten drops three times a day in a little water to children two 
or three years old. Fellows' syrup of the hypophosphites is 
a very useful preparation in such cases, and may be given in 
doses of five drops largely diluted with water, three times a 
day, immediately after food. The following mixture is useful: 
Steel drops, one drachm; solution of chloride of calcium, 
three drachms; glycerine, half an ounce; water to make four 
ounces. A teaspoonful for a child from three to five years 
old in water three times a day. A visit to the seaside is 
very beneficial. 

Prickly Heat. — Treatment. Take two teaspoonfuls of 

cream tartar, and pour on it one pint of boiling water, 

sweeten to taste, drink frequently unless it acts upon the 
bowels; in that case take less. 

Ringworm. This disease is caused by the growth in the 
skin of a low form of vegetable life allied to ordinary mold. 
When some of the scales of a hair affected with ringworm are 
placed in liquid, and magnified about 300 times, we can then 
very readily see the spores or seeds, and the mycelium or thread 
of the fungus. 

Ringworm of the scalp shows itself as a dry, scurfy or scaly 
condition of some portion of the scalp, generally in separate 
patches more or less circular, on which the hairs are broken 
off, and the surface presents a dirty appearance, with some 
redness beneath. 

On the face, body or limbs the disease appears in the form of 



336 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

rings of various sizes, generally pretty round, and of a 
reddish color; they commence as minute points, and increase 
in size pretty rapidly, healing in the center as the disease 
progresses centrifugally. As this disease is contagious, 
children suffering from it should not go to school or play 
with others till they are cured. 

Treafoient. — Amongst the popular remedies used in the 
treatment of this disease are ink and vinegar. The strong 
acetic acid is a useful preparation. It should be used once 
and well rubbed in. The liniment of iodine is a most use- 
ful preparation. It should be applied by means of a camel's 
hair brush or feather, and may be repeated in a few days if 
necessary. Great cleanliness is necessary in this affection, 
and if the disease is situated on the scalp, the hair must be 
cut away for some little distance round the diseased patch 
before applying the remedy. 

Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina. This is an acute 
febrile disease, producing a scarlet rash upon the skin, 
attended by a sore throat, and often swelling of various' 
glands, and sometimes followed by dropsy. It is more com- 
mon in childhood than in adult life, and one attack confers 
great, if not complete, immunity from another. This disease 
gives rise to a great deal of mortality, and chiefly in those 
under ten years of age. Contagion is the main, if not only 
cause of scarlet fever; measles and whooping cough are 
more contagious; typhoid fever and diphtheria less conta- 
gious. The poison may be retain in clothes for a year or 
more and then give rise to fever. Both sexes are equally 
liable to an attack; between eighteen months and five years 
is the most common time to have the fever; no season has 
much influence upon it, but in this country it is perhaps most 
common between November and February. Many people 
confuse the terms scarlet fever and scarlatina, and imagine 
the latter is a milder affection; this is a geat mistake, for 
scarlatina is only the Latin name for scarlet fever, and not 



Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 337 

a different form. Scarlet fever may be very mild, or malig- 
nant, or latent. The period of incubation is generally about 
a week, but may be only twenty-four hours. 

The onset is sudden; there is sore throat with tenderness 
at the angles of the lower jaw, and stiffness at the back of 
the neck; vomiting is very common, and chiefly so in 
children; shivering and rigors come on and occasionally con- 
vulsions in young children. The temperature rapidly rises 
and will go up to 104 or 105 ; the pulse is very quick, the 
tongue is covered with a thin, white fur; there is thirst and 
loss of appetite. This stage lasts from twelve to thirty 
hours, and then a rash comes out. Sometimes the earlier 
symptoms are so slight that the rash is the first thing noticed. 
The rash consists of small scarlet dots, almost running 
together so as to give a flush all over the skin ; the color disap- 
pears on pressure, but rapidly re-appears when the pressure is 
removed. It generally appears at first on the sides of the 
neck and upper part of the chest and in the bends of the 
joints; it then spreads downward and is found to come out 
last on the legs; it begins to fade on the fourth or fifth day 
and is generally quite gone within a week. 

Diarrhoea may be profuse, and exhaust the patient. Bleeding 
from the nose may occur, but is not often a bad symptom. 
Perforation of the bowel may occur from an error in diet, and 
is very fatal. Inflammation of the peritoneum adds greatly 
to the danger. Bronchitis and pneumonia may supervene 
and increase the danger. 

Treatment. — Place the patient in a well-ventilated room. 
Remove all curtains, carpets and bed-hangings. Prevent 
exertion on the part of the patient. The greatest cleanliness 
must be observed, and all excreta removed at once, Pond's 
extract, carbolic acid, or chloride of lime being mixed with 
them. The diarrhoea need not be checked unless the 
motions are very frequent, and then a little starch injection 
may be given. The diet must be very light, and no solid 

22 



338 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

food should be taken under six weeks or two months, 
because, in consequence of the-ulceration of the bowels, the 
coats are very thin and liable to burst. Absolutely nothing 
should be given to the patient beyond what has been ordered 
by the medical attendant. Milk must form the main article 
of diet, and then an egg or two may be beaten up in it, or a 
custard may be given, and beef-tea. If there is much dis- 
tension of the bowels, hot flannels sprinkled with turpentine 
will be useful. 

Teething. The period of teething is one which is looked 
upon by many mothers with dread. Owing to the greater 
irritability of the system usually found to exist at this time, 
there are diseases which are more liable to attack the child; 
and in order that everything may be done on the mother's 
part to guard against these, it will be well that she should 
be made familiar- with the usual time of appearance of the 
teeth, andwith a few hints that may be of service in maintain- 
ing the health of the child during this period. 

The first, or temporary, teeth, generally begin to make 
their appearance between the fifth and eighth month, in the 
following order: The two central front teeth of the lower 
jaw, called central incisors; the corresponding teeth in the 
upper jaw, the lateral incisors; the four anterior molars; 
the four canines, the two upper of which are popularly called 
eye teeth; and lastly, the four posterior molars. 

During the cutting of the temporary teeth, the infant's 
head should be kept perfectly cool, and for this purpose all 
caps and wraps of every kind must be removed. The cloth- 
ing should be light and warm. The apartments occupied 
by the child should be kept rather cool at this time. If the 
bowels are confined, the diet should be altered, and a little 
calcined magnesia may be given. 

Thrush. This is a common affection in children. It may 
be seen in the mouth as small white specks on the lining 
membrane, but this may be so also in various parts of the 



Diseases of Infancy and CJiildhooa 1 339 

intestinal canal. It is often due to malnutrition and bad 
feeding, and often when the milk is sour. The swallowing 
of food becomes difficult, there is thirst, and the water is 
scanty and high colored. 

Treatment. — If the infant is bottle fed, have everything 
scrupulously clean. Give a little lime water in the milk, in 
the proportion of one part to four. Paint the mouth frequently 
with glycerine and borax, using a feather or small camel's 
hairbrush; or dissolve some powdered borax in water and 
apply in the same way. Should this fail, thirty grains of 
cholrate of potassium may be mixed with one ounce of 
glycerine, and applied in the same manner as the glycerine 
and borax. Great attention must be paid to the diet, and 
any errors must at once be corrected. If the bowels are 
disordered and the motions offensive, benefit may be derived 
by giving the child one of the following powders twice a 
day: Gray powder, six grains; bicarbonate of soda, eighteen 
grains; powdered rhubarb, eight grains. Mix and divide 
into six powders. One twice a day to a child a year old. 

Whooping Cough. This is a disease of great frequency 
in childhood, and a large proportion of infant mortality is 
due to this cause. 

Symptoms. — The earliest is a common cold or catarrh, ac- 
companied by a cough; there is also a slight amount of fever, 
restlessness, and sometimes running at the eyes and nose. 
The cough in a few days becomes most troublesome, and 
some glairy fluid may be brought up from the chest; in a 
week or ten days, but often later, the child will begin to 
have the characteristic whoop; the cough comes on in 
paroxysms and is more frequent by night than by day, each 
paroxysm begins with a deep and loud inspiration, followed 
by a succession of short and sharp expirations, again followed 
by a deep inspiration, and the repeated expirations; this may 
go on several times, and last one or two minutes, according 



340 Diseases of Infancy and Childhood 

to the severity of the case. Just before each attack comes 
on, the child clings to its nurse or mother; it sits in an erect 
position. During the paroxysm the face is flushed, the veins 
in the head and face prominent, the eyes suffused and watery, 
and generally there is some glairy fluid expelled from the 
mouth, or vomiting may come on. After the paroxysm the 
child will rest for a time, and appear pretty well until the 
next attack comes on. These symptoms last for three or four 
weeks, and then the cough abates in severity and frequency, 
and finally ceases altogether. In most cases there is some 
bronchitis attending this complaint, and this is shown by 
the hurried breathing, rise of temperature, and by hearing 
rattling noises over the chest. The more mischief there is 
in the lungs, the greater is the danger to the child. Con- 
vulsions are a sign of bad import, and are generally the im- 
mediate cause of death in such cases. 

Treatment. — In all cases it is best for the child to be kept 
in the house as soon as the malady has declared itself; in a 
very mild case it need not be kept in bed, but it should be 
in a room of warm and even temperature, and protected from 
draught; it can then be allowed to play about as it likes. If 
there is any lung affection, it must be put to bed and treated 
according to the requirements of the case. Other children 
must not be allowed to come near it, unless they have had an 
attack previously, in order that its spreading may be prevented. 
The child must be fed in the usual way, but solid food should 
be given sparingly. Steel wine is very valuable in cases of 
whooping cough, and more especially when there is no fever 
and during convalescence: it may also stop the diarrhoea, 
which is now and then present. Numberless remedies have 
been tried for whooping cough, but as many of them are 
powerful and require careful watching, they ought only to be 
given under medical direction. Some sweet mucilaginous 
fluid may be given, such as the mucilage of gum acacia mixed 



Diseases of Infancy and CJiildkood 341 

with glycerine in the proportion of a teaspoonful of the latter 
to a tablespoonful of the former; a teaspoonful of this being 
given to a child three or four years old three or four times 
a day. The spine may be advantageously rubbed with a 
mixture of opodeldoc and belladonna liniment, two drachms 
of the latter to an ounce and a half of the former; it may be 
applied night and morning. Warm clothing ought to be 
worn, and during convalescence a nourishing diet, moderate 
exercise in the open air when fine, a tepid bath in the morn- 
ing, and a tonic, as steel wine or cod liver oil, must be 
enjoined. 

LINIMENTS, SYRUPS, TROCHES 

The " Best Liniment." For sprains, bruises, pains, 
colic, etc. Take of chloroform, alcohol, ammonia water, 
spirits of camphor, tincture of aconite root, of each two 
ounces, sweet spirits of nitre, six ounces; mix, apply. 

Stillingia Liniment. Take of oil of stillingia, one 
ounce, oil of cajuput, one-half ounce, oil of lobelia, two 
drachms, alcohol, two ounces; mix. To be used in croup, 
joint or glandular swellings, and in chronic rheumatism. 

Stimulating Balsam. To stimulate ulcers and ab- 
scesses: Take of nitrate of mercury, twenty grains, 
iodoform, thirty grains, camphor, two drachms, balsam 
Peru, two ounces; mix. Apply or inject. 

A Remedy .for Burns. A celebrated German remedy 
for burns consists of fifteen ounces of the best white glue, 
broken in small pieces, into two pints of water, and allowed 
to become soft. Then dissolve, by means of a water-bath 
(an extemporaneous water-bath can be made by putting a 
tin pail into a kettle of boiling water), and two ounces of 
glycerine and six drachms of carbolic acid added, the heat 
being continued until all is thoroughly dissolved. On cooling, 
this hardens to an elastic mass, covered with a shining, 



342 Liniments, Syrups, Troches 

parchment-like skin, and may be kept for any length of time. 

When required for use it is placed for a few minutes in a 
water bath until sufficiently liquid, and applied to the burnt 
surface by means of a broad brush. It forms in about two 
minutes a shining, smooth, flexible, and nearly transparent 
skin, and will cause almost instantaneous relief to the 
sufferer. 

An Excellent Cough Syrup. Take five cents' 
worth each of sweet spirits of nitre, paregoric, syrup of 
squills and sweet oil; put all in a pint of molasses, dose, a 
teaspoonful several times a day. 

Cough Troches. One ounce of powdered licorice-root, 
one ounce of powdered gum-arabic, one ounce of powdered 
cubebs, mix all together with one pound of pulverized 
sugar, add enough water to make a stiff paste like bread 
dough; roll out thin and cut in shape with an open top 
thimble; arrange upon sheets of foolscap, and set away to 
dry. These troches will be found excellent.

HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICINES AND THEIR 
USE IN THE FAMILY 

Homoeopathy Defined. In a work in which it is 
sought to give information on every branch of household 
management, and in which even the treatment of diseases 
and their prevention and cure, must of necessity be briefly 
discussed, it is manifest that the important mode and means 
of medical treatment known as Homoeopathy ought not to 
be ignored. In order to arrive at a correct idea of what 
homoeopathy is, it is necessary first of all to ascertain the 
meaning of the word itself, and to understand why it is used 
to designate that form of medical practice to which it was 
applied by the founder of this system of medicine, Dr. 
Samuel Hahnemann, who first announced his discovery to 
the medical world in 1796. Theory, generally speaking, 
forms the basis of practice in every art and science, and in 
no science is this more perceptible than in the science of 
medicine. Thus in medical practice it has arisen that there 
are two great and opposing schools of medicine, each of 
which is based on a widely different theory; that of the or- 
dinary medical practitioner being Contraria contrariis curaiit/tr, 
a sentence in Latin which means, when rendered as simply 
and concisely as possible, "Opposites are cured by oppo- 
sites;" and that of the homoeopathic practitioner, Similia 
similibus curantur, another sentence in Latin, which means 
"Likes are cured by likes." Going a little deeper into the 
matter, the first of these sentences implies that in the treat- 
ment of any disease, be it what it may, drugs should 
be used which will produce in the body of the patient 
a condition opposite to that, induced by the disease to 

343 



344 The Family Doctor 

be cured, or in other words that it is needful to counteract 
the disease and arrest. its progress by the administra- 
tion of medicines that will produce effects different, 
from those resulting from the disease itself. The second, 
on the contrary, implies that in the treatment of any dis- 
ease, be it what it may, drugs should be used which would 
produce in a healthy person symptoms resembling, or like to, 
those occasioned by the disease by which the patient is 
affected. Hence Hahnemann was led to apply to the gener- 
ally accepted mode of medical treatment the term Allopathy 
from two Greek words, alios, another, and pathos, suffering; 
and to his own method the term Homceopathy, also from 
two Greek words, homoios, similar, or like, and pathos, 
suffering. Thus Allopathy, to be perfectly clear and plain 
even at the risk of repetition, implies that mode of medical 
practice which consists in using drugs to produce in the 
body a condition opposite to the disease to be cured, and 
which has been treated first in this department of Treasures 
Old and New; and Homceopathy a mode of treating 
diseases by the administration of medicines capable of ecxit- 
ing in healthy persons symptoms closely similar to those of 
the disease for which they are given. 

The Principle of Homceopathy. It is possible that 
some persons may entertain an idea that the medicines given 
by the homceopathist would produce in a healthy person 
precisely the same diseases as those which are given to 
counteract in any one suffering from disease. This is 
altogether erroneous for the symptoms produced by any 
particular drug or medicine in a healthy person are only 
similar or: like those resulting from the disease itself, and not 
in any way the same as the symptoms excited by the disease 
or identical with them. It must be noted that the great 
principle of homoeopathy is that Likes cure likes, not that 
Identicals cure identicals, and this must never be lost sight 



The Family Doctor 345 

of. "Homoeopathy," to quote the words of Dr. Richard 
Eppsp "is the practical application of the law, Likes are 
cured by likes, to the cure of disease. This law, as an axiom, 
would read, It is impossible for two similar diseases to exist in 
the same individual and at the same time. ' ' The morbific matter, 
state or condition, call it which you will, which has caused 
the disease, or generated the sickly state into which the 
patient has lapsed, is counteracted and neutralized by the 
action of the drug which, in a healthy person, would pro- 
duce symptoms similar to, but not identical with, those 
which are excited by the disease. 

The Principle Supported. The principle of homoeo- 
pathy having been enunciated, it is now desirable to see if 
any results of general experience can be cited in its sup- 
port. In the case, for example, of a severe burn is it the 
custom to apply cooling lotions or any substance that 
happens to be a good conductor of heat to the part affected ? 
Certainly not, must be the reply; for although cooling ap- 
plications of any kind may be soothing for a time and a 
source of comfort to the sufferer, it is well known that they 
tend to increase inflammation in the long run, and to render 
the pain of the burn more acutely felt. Then the theory that 
"Opposites are cured by opposites" does not hold good in 
this case. No; but the contrary theory that "Likes are 
cured by likes" does most assuredly, for such burns are most 
quickly cured by the application of oil of turpentine or 
heated spirits of wine, both of which, when applied to the 
skin, cause a burning or tingling sensation, and by wrapping 
the part affected with wadding or cotton wool which is a 
good non-conductor of heat, and maintains warmth in the 
part burnt, preventing the atmospheric air from obtaining 
free access to it. Again, in cases of frost-bite the best thing 
to be done is to rub the part that is frost-bitten with snow, 
which is frozen water, and not to hold it to the fire or bathe 



346 The Family Doctor 

it with warm water, which would spoil any chance that 
might otherwise exist of restoring the injured part to its 
former condition. Now what are these but direct evidences 
in favor of the homoeopathic theory, " Likes are cured by 
likes," and in opposition to the allopathic theory that "Op- 
posites are cured by opposites. " 

The Practice of Homoeopathy. At the introduction 
of homoeopathy it was the general practice of medical men 
who favored and adopted the new theory to give medicines 
in the doses usually employed, but it was found that these 
acted too powerfully, and thus did injury, because patients 
who exhibited the morbid symptoms of the disease to 
counteract which the drugs were given, were all the more 
disposed to yield to the medicinal effects of the drugs them- 
selves, which, as experience soon showed, were not required 
in such strong doses. Hence the quantities given were 
gradually reduced until a minimum was attained, which was 
possessed of power sufficient to counteract the morbid symp- 
toms and effect a cure, without causing inconvenience, and 
often suffering, by excess of medicinal action. Thus it is 
that small doses have become the rule in homoeopathic prac- 
tice, not because large doses would fail to effect a cure, but 
because when it was discovered that small doses would do 
the work as well and even better, it Was doing harm to the 
patient and really wasting power to persevere in a course 
which was found to be altogether unnecessary. 

The Practice Supported. Following the course that 
has been adopted in the consideration of the principle of 
homoeopathy, let us now see what reasons can be adduced in 
favor of small does versus large doses in addition to those 
which have just been given. It is a well known fact that 
children have sometimes got hold of a bottle of homoeopathic 
globules or pilules and have swallowed the bottleful without 
inconvenience or any palpable effect, and because no harm 



The Family Doctor 347 

has resulted from this wholesale consumption of medicine 
that is represented to be possessed of great power to cure 
certain ailments it has been argued that because it has done 
no harm in the cases to which reference has been made, it is 
equally impossible for it to do any good. But homoeopathic 
medicine, be it remembered, will only acthomceopathically, 
that is to say it will only produce the desired effect in 
persons who are suffering from any disorder, which may be 
counteracted by its use. The children in question were in 
no way predisposed by morbid symptoms to yield to the 
influence of the medicine, which, if taken even in single glob- 
ules, was of sufficient strength to benefit any one who really 
needed it, but was not sufficiently strong, even collectively, 
to produce any effect on a healthy person, larger doses being 
required to produce medicinal effects than are required to 
counteract and cure morbid symptoms. 

Preparation of Homoeopathic Medicines. These are 
supplied in two forms, namely in globules or pilules and in 
tinctures, the latter form beingconsideredpreferable. Soluble 
drugs are prepared homceopathically by what is termed suc- 
cussion or shaking, that is to say a mode of treatment which 
effects the dispersion of a drug through liquid, generally 
alcohol, until the drug is equally diffused through the whole 
of the liquid; and insoluble drugs by trituration, or rubbing 
up in some vehicle, generally sugar of milk, until the whole 
of the vehicle used is equally and thoroughly permeated by 
it. Thus it is that every individual globule or drop in medi- 
cine homceopathically prepared is of equal strength with its 
fellows. The potency of such minute subdivisions is as- 
cribed to the extension of surface brought about by succus- 
sion or trituration, as the case may be. It is argued that the 
active power of any drug is enormously increased by this so 
called extension of surface, and as a piece of gold leaf one 
inch square may be hammered out into a thinner leaf ten 



348 The Family Doctor 

inches square, its surface being thus increased a hundred- 
fold, so mercury which may be taken in large quantities 
almost with impunity, because in too great bulk to be active 
in proportion to its bulk, has its active properties marvel- 
ously increased by rubbing it up with some vehicle so as to 
procure its equal subdivision, or, in other words, extension 
of surface. It is then from this extension of surface 
that homoeopathic medicines derive their power and 
active properties. Evidence of this is obtained from the 
fact that the nutritive properties of the soil are brought into 
a better condition for their receptive assimilation as plantfood 
by plants, by the action of the frost — God's plow-which breaks 
up the clods into minute pieces, setting free its various con- 
stituents by subdivision of matter. Now what is this but 
increasing the active properties of the soil by extension of 
surface ? 

Advantages of Homoeopathy. Broadly stated, all- 
opathists for the most part give copious doses of nauseous 
drugs which disgust the adult patient and terrify children, 
and by severity of action often tend to reduce bodily strength. 
Homoeopathists, on the contrary, give medicines which, 
although they are sufficiently powerful to produce the effect 
that is desired are in no way calculated to induce weakness 
or interfere with any susceptibility peculiar to the patient, and 
have the merit of being perfectly tasteless. Surely these are 
good points, sufficient to induce every parent who has viewed 
with pain and sorrow the prolonged reluctance of children 
to swallow ordinary medicine, and every one who has any 
respect for his own palate and sense of taste, to give the 
system a fair trial. 

Diet. In homoeopathy strict attention to diet is required, 
and unquestionably this is most helpful in the treatment of 
all diseases, and in some ailments of a minor kind sufficient 
to effect a cure, although this is denied by homoeopathic 



The Family Doctor 349 

practitioners, who assert that attention to diet can never be 
effectual in effecting a cure, but is useful in allowing the 
full curative action of the medicine given. It is almost 
needless to add that close attention to diet is necessary only 
during treatment, though it is at all times desirable for 
everyone, whether man, woman or child, to be temperate 
and prudent both in eating and drinking, if they desire tb 
keep in good health. 

Medicines used in Homoeopathy. For home treat- 
ment medicine chests are supplied by all homoeopathic chem- 
ists, and chemists and druggists in general, with the medi- 
cines that are most commonly used. The following list of 
such medicines is taken from Dr. Epps' " Epitome of the 
Homoeopathic Family Instructor," a most useful manual for 
home use and home practice:

HOMOEOPATHIC TREATMENT OF DISEASES 



In so brief a notice of the principles and practice of homoeopathy it is man- 
ifestly impossible to give even a list of the diseases to which human beings 
are unfortunately subject, and the special remedies that are used for their 
relief. The utmost that can be done under the circumstances, and the 
limited amount of space at command, is to enumerate in alphabetical order 
a few of the most common ailments that man is subject to, and briefly 
indicate the treatment that they require, and the medicines that are em- 
ployed to counteract them. 



Appetite, Failure of. For loss of appetite, accom- 
panied by constipation of the bowels, pain in the stomach, 
especially a feeling of fulness at the pit of the stomach after 
eating, with broken and unrefreshing sleep, Nux vomica is 
needed, which may be taken in alternation with Sulphur in 
doses of one drop of the tinctures in a tablespoonful of water 
every three hours. 

Biliousness. For an ordinary bilious attack, which 
frequently follows indulgence in what is called good eating 
and drinking, and is often the outcome of sedentary occupa- 
tions, the usual remedies are Mercurius and Nux vomica in 
alternation, in doses of one drop of the tinctures in a table- 
spoonful of water every two hours until relief is obtained. 
Pulsatilla is prescribed for persons of fair complexion, 
especially women, instead of Nux vomica. The ordinary 
symptoms of such an attack are a foul tongue with nausea, 
and frequently actual vomiting. 

Bruises. For simple bruises and contusions, make a 
lotion of one teaspoonful of Arnica tincture to four table- 
spoonfuls of water and apply to the part affected by lint 
doubled twice or thrice and soaked in the lotion. Cover 

350 



The Family Doctor 35 r 

with oiled silk, and change the lint or renew the dipping 
as soon as the lint is dry. 

Catarrh, or Cold in the Head. The chief symptoms 
of this disorder are to be found in watering of the eyes, 
which feel hot and inflamed; a general feverishness, espec- 
ially in the head, stoppage of and running from the nose, 
accompanied with sneezing, all these being sometimes fol- 
lowed by a troublesome cough. The principal remedies, in 
conjunction with general abstinence and the promotion of 
perspiration by a warm bath, are Aconitum napellus for symp- 
toms as named above; Belladonna for sore throat and tick- 
ling in the throat, causing cough; Mercicrius for running 
from the nose and frequent sneezing, and Nux vomica for 
stoppage in the nose accompanied by constipated bowels. 
The dose for either remedy is one drop of the tincture in 
one tablespoonful of water every two, three or four hours, 
according to the severity of the attack. 

Camomilla in the same proportions and at the same inter- 
vals of time is a favorite and useful remedy for this com- 
plaint in women and children. 

Colic, or Pain in the Bowels. This is occasioned by 
a variety of causes, which induce severe pain iu the region 
of the bowels, accompanied by vomiting and cold perspira- 
tion all over the body. The sufferer should have a warm 
bath and be well covered up with clothes in bed, and have 
flannels plunged in warm water and wrung out as dry as 
possible, applied to the bowels. If the abdomen be very 
tender when touched and the patient be feverish, Aconitum 
napellus is indicated. For colic, accompanied by severe 
spasmodic pains, Belladonna is required; for colic arising 
from partaking of food too plentifully, accompanied by rest- 
lessness and grinding of the teeth in sleep, Coffaa; for 
intensification of pain at night, with nausea and loose green- 
ish evacuations, Mercurius; for spasms and pain mainly 



352 The Family Doctor 

caused by indigestion, Mercurius; for colic in children, 
Camomilla. Doses for adults, one drop of the tincture in one 
tablespoonful of water every three hours: for children, half 
the quantity; for infants, one-fourth the quantity. 

Constipation. The symptoms of constipation are too 
well known to require mention here. Where the constipa- 
tion is habitual and obstinate, an enema of warm water or 
of warm water gruel is of great assistance. For persons 
who have a bilious temperament and suffer from rheumatism, 
or when the constipation is accompanied by a chilly feeling, 
Bryonia is desirable; for constipation that is occasioned by 
sedentary occupation and accompanied by headache and a 
tendency to piles, Nux vomica is indicated, in alternation 
with Sulphur where constipation is habitual. Pulsatilla is 
better suited for women than Nux vomica, and Opium is 
useful when constipation is the result of lead poisoning, 
with great difficulty of evacuation, or utter inability in this 
direction. The doses in every case and of every remedy are 
one drop of the tincture in one tablespoonful of water, ad- 
ministered every four hours till relief is obtained. 

Cough. For a hard, dry cough Aco?iitum napellus is re- 
quired; for a cough with wheezing, difficulty of expectora- 
tion and need of keeping the head high in bed, Antimonium 
tartariami; for a dry, spasmodic cough, with sore throat and 
thirst, or for a nervous cough, Belladonna; for cough with 
expectoration and pain, especially between the shoulders 
when coughing, Bryonia; for cough accompanied with con- 
stipation and fulness at the pit of the stomach, Nux vomica; 
for cough in children the most suitable remedy is Ipecacu- 
anha. Dose, one drop of the tincture in one tablespoonful 
of water, given every two, three or four hours as needful. 

Diarrhoea. For this disorder, when accompanied by 
great pain in the stomach and bowels, watery stools and 



The Family Doctor 353 

exhaustion, Arsenicum is required; when caused by drinking 
cold water when heated, Bryonia; for griping pains and 
indications of dysentery, Mercurius; when caused by indi- 
gestion and indulgence in rich food and pastry, Pulsatilla. 
For diarrhoea in children Camomilla is a useful remedy. 
Dose. — One drop of the tincture in one tablespoonful of 
water to be given after each evacuation as it occurs. 

Fever. For feverish attacks of a simple character Acon- 
itum napellus is an effectual remedy, given every two, three 
or four hours, in doses of one drop of the tincture to one 
tablespoonful of water. For fever of a dangerous character, 
Bryonia, Rhus toxicodendron and Arsenicum are the remedies, 
with Belladonna, Mercurius and Sulphur in scarlet fever. 

Headache. There are many kinds of headache, excited 
by various causes and presenting various symptoms, but the^ 
most common are headaches proceeding from indigestion, 
nervous headache and sick headache. For the first of these 
the remedy is Nux vomica or Pulsatilla; for the second, Ig- 
natia, and for the third and last, Belladonna and Jgnatia, 
with Ipecacuanha when the headache is accompanied by 
vomiting. Dose. — One drop of the tincture in one table- 
spoonful of water at intervals of six hours. 

Indigestion. For this complaint in nervous and hypo- 
chondriacal patients, Arnica montana is usually prescribed; 
in bilious and rheumatic patients Bryonia; for chronic dys- 
pepsia Hepar Sulphuris; and for indigestion produced by 
over eating or sedentary occupation, Nux vomiea. Dose. — 
One drop of the tincture in one tablespoonful of water 
administered every two, three or four hours, according to 
circumstances.
