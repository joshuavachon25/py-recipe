sideraM:;^ to the vitamin 3i (thiamin) and vitamin G (riooflavin) content 
of the diet, and also provides some of the pellagra-preventing factor 
(nicotinic scid). Most of the vitamin values of whole-rheat (graham) 
flour are due to the presence of the germ and bran portion of the grain. 
'Vliole-'Mieat (graham) flour also contains the iron and phosphoms that 
occur naturally in the outer layers of the t,rsin. Its "bran content 
provides roughage, a certain aiacunt of v,'hich is considered desirable
