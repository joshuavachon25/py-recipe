FOREWORD 

This book stands for economy of foods and sim- 
plicity of thinking and preparation. 

Each group of recipes is built on one foundation 
recipe. 

For this reason this book is invaluable as a text 
book in schools and community classes of house- 
wives who arrange to study together and compare 
notes as they practice with the foundation recipes 
and their variations. 

Such a method of group study will show the un- 
limited number of recipes that can be made from the 
basic recipe. 

Guided by this, dare to make your own combina- 
tions. For example, instead of using a cup of boiled 
rinds in fruit cake, use a cup of stewed rhubarb. 

Should you desire plans for co-operative study, 
write the Author.

INTRODUCTION 



Women! Are you patriotic? To serve your Eat to live, 
country you yourself must have good health ; and _ ^ 
you must help to conserve certain foods for our 
Boys. 

For some years the method of feeding herein ad- Others have 
vocated has been tried by the sick and the well, gained much, 
with the result that the sick became well and the 
strong gained in energy and reserve force. 

On account of satisfactory results, many enthu- 
siasts asked for a book of recipes, and explanations 
of the body's needs. 

The request came again from Mrs. E. A. Miller, 
on the ground that the patriotic were seeking sim- 
pler menus, that would give the maximum of health 
for the minimum of expense and time for prepara- 
tion. 

Help, and certain foods, are scarce, and will be Try to make 

more so should the war continue. There are other J^^u^^hS Sey** 

foods about us in abundance — perfectly adapted to iqqj^ good, 

nourish us — and not adapted to long distance trans- taste good, 

portation — which we will thoroughly enjoy as soon are good, 
as we allow ourselves to become familiar with their 
uses. 

Be encouraged by the fact that these recipes and If you don't

that it takes less coal and less of your energy to 
make your furnace run above par than below par? 
When you run a stove below par (i. e., with the 
drafts choked off) you have to shovel on more coal, 
and shake a heavier fire, and clean out more clinkers

Many intelligent people think that we should eat 
the foods of high nutritive value, regardless of any 
other consideration. The body is not given any 
credit for its ability to manufacture what it needs. 

If the body gets the most nourishment out of the 
highly nutritive foods, why are those people who 
live on eggs, meats, milk, fats, etc., not better nour- 
ished — i. e., in a healthier condition? Are not many 
of the anemic people whom you know fed with the 
so-called "best" foods?

readily be stored up if the excretory channels were

Foods must be chosen which, instead of poisons, will 
supply the body with the material to manufacture 
good red blood to be carried to the various parts of 
the body to replace dead tissues. These wholesome 
activities will help to re-establish proper elimination.

Millions of dollars have been and are being spent 
in Laboratory Research work. And still the so- 
called "incurable" diseases — such as Infantile 
Paralysis, Bright's Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, Loco- 
motor Ataxia, Goitre, Asthma, Hay Fever, etc., etc., 
still baffle the searchers. 

Noting the lack of positive results in regard to 
these and other diseases, you would be only just to

to do BO. in the laboratory or not — should speak for them-

look pasty too. Anemia has been fashionable. But 
we are awaking to our inheritance — "Made in the 
image and likeness of God" ! 

The aesthetic side of our food sense needs training. 
The old chromoes no longer appeal. Liking for 
the pallid loaf is rapidly giving way to appreciation 
of the far more appetizing qualities and value of the 
wholesome-looking crisp brown crust. As we in- 
dividually realize that the brown flour or rye or corn 
meal products are more healthful than the white 
flour residues we have been idealizing, we will each

water between meals. 

3. Breakfast as above. Eat baked, boiled or raw 
onions for both lunch and dinner, with bread (only 
a small amount). 

4. Put a little salt on tongue to make saliva flow, 
and expectorate. Repeat. 

5. Take hot bath for 15 or 20 minutes, or until 
perspiration starts ; then a cold or cool shower or 
spray, quickly. Roll in warm blanket, and retire, 
well covered, but keeping windows open. 

If the cold is very severe, drink hot lemonade after 
bath. 

This bath rnay be taken instead of a meal, or 
THREE HOURS AFTER one. 

In the morning take a cool sponge bath. 

6. ONE HOUR BEFORE a meal, or THREE 
HOURS AFTER one, take a cool or cold SITZ

well covered, and gently lave the abdomen. 

For a severe cold, take two or three times daily. 

If you are constipated, eat fruit, or dried fruit

In severe cases, use Christian's Bran according to 
directions.

LABOR-SAVING SUGGESTIONS 



Think oat an 
easier way than 
you have 
drifted into. 



Plan an energy- 
saving sequence. 



For instance, 

Free yourself 
from unneces- 
sary, time- 
stealing habits. 

Then you can 
practise your 
music or raise 
vegetables (and 
health) in your 
community 
garden. 



See how few dishes and utensils you can manage 
with when baking or cooking. The most efficient 
worker will use the fewest. 

See how clean you can keep yourself and your sur- 
roundings while working. 

See how much you can accomplish by doing only 
a little work. Have a reason for everything you do, 
and for doing it then. 

It is true efficiency to get to the table the most 
nourishing food, with the least expenditure of 
strength, money and time. 

Why grate cheese for a baked dish ? It is unneces- 
sary. Probably it was invented by the man who 
wanted to sell graters ! And women fell for it, and 
it became a habit, and has kept you in the kitchen 
an unnecessary length of time! Crush, break, or 
cut the cheese into small pieces and sprinkle over, 
or mix with, the materials desired. This will save 
your knuckles, and you will avoid cleaning the 
grater. 

Cook the amount of perishable food you need 
from day to day, and save your ice bills and the care 
of a refrigerator. Cooked food deteriorates.

TO THE SUFFERING 



DRINK plenty of water. 

LIVE on orange juice, or pineapple juice (Dole's 
IS good), for a few days, or until you are hungry. 

UNTIL you regain your vitality, eat a fruit meal 
for breakfast; cereal and milk or cream for lunch, 
and one or two vegetables, with potato, rice, or 
bread, for dinner. 

THE LESS you eat, the better chance you give 
your body to right itself. 

SHOULD you find yourself weak after omitting 
a meal or two, remember that it is because your 
mental attitude toward occasional abstinence is 
wrong; or your food for the day before yesterday 
was not nourishing. 

It takes 24 to 48 hours before you get real 
strength from the food you eat, so you cannot miss 
the nourishment until a day or so later. Hence any 
sensation of weakness after omitting a meal is due 
to the lack of "kick" or stimulant in that meal, and 
you have been depending on stimulants, instead of 
nourishing yourself. If your strength is no more 
genuinely supported than that, you are "skating on 
thin ice," and are due for a bad break unless you re- 
establish the reserve.

Normally, the body has nourishment stored up

body has one too, when properly treated. If you

AVOID all stimulating foods and drinks. Meat 
and eggs are stimulating foods. Tea, coffee, and 
alcohoiic beverages are stimulating drinks. 

COCOA, or chocolate, may be used on rare oc- 
casions. 

DO all your mixing outside of your stomach. 
ALL combinations should appeal through the eye, 
and taste good, for ready digestion and assimilation. 

PRACTICE the ABSENCE of VARIETY at a 
meal.

We are under obligation to them to compel the 
millers to turn the grains and cereals over to us with 
their full content of nutriment — with no whit of 
their food value deleted. 

We are under obligation to them to instruct the 
millers that the time is past for separating the grain 
into a major part of food strength to be fed to the 
animals, and a minor part of food strength for the 
people's portion. 

I once heard a woman (whose husband was earn- 
ing $15 a week) say: "I don't care how much more 
nutriment grayish or brownish or yellowish bread 
has. I don't care if there isn't any nutriment in 
white bread. I don't like the idea of eating colored 
stuff, and I shan't eat any but white bread, because 
that is the only kind I like the looks of.^' 

This woman was one of the many victims of the 
then current fallacious idea. Now, she must accept 
the "colored stuff" or go without. Her experiences 
will soon show her that her body is nourished 
through her stomach, not through her eyes, and she 
will realize how inestimably her health is benefited.

the women tilling the fields, the little children, of 
that devastated land — has been reduced — to feed our 
boys who are "over there." 

Will not that shame us all out of our com- 
placency? 

And so I put it to you, is not the woman who goes 
on cooking with the foods which should be shipped 
to France and to Italy and to wherever our "boys" 
are — is not that woman a traitor to them, and to 
herself, and to the cause for which they are giving 
even their lives? 

Let her serve no dish whose preparation is a re- 
flection upon her patriotism. And if her family 
would grumble, being but lukewarm patriots, let 
her silence them with two words : 

EAT WHAT IS HERE, AND GROW Who is not for 
STRONG, AND GIVE THANKS; OR 

SEEK BOARD AND LODGING WHERE "^ '^ *«^"** "'• 
YOU BELONG— IN AN ENEMY ALIEN IN- 
TERNMENT CAMP. 



Woman has filled many roles. Up to this time 
she has "catered" most humbly to the whims and 
fancies of her family. This member would not 
allow anything to appear before him a second time. 
To serve a "left-over" was considered cause for 
divorce. One member wouldn't have this ; another 
member wouldn't have that. So many courses were 
necessary before a meal could be called a meal. 
The family's position in society required this or that. 

Now, mayhap, woman must fill a new role. 

Loyal FOOD TYRANTS, hearts strong with the 
righteousness of the Battle of the Kitchens ; hearts

Every woman can learn to make the new dishes 
palatable and appetizing. But it is true that the 
eye has much to do with the satisfaction of eating, 
so it is equally part of our duty to learn to make 
them attractive. When that is done in any home, 
the battle for that kitchen is largely won. 

Always plan to use all the space in a heated oven. 

WHEN BAKING BREAD: 

Have baked potato, or some other baked dish, for 
lunch. 

Bake some oatmeal or other cookies. 

Bake some vegetable roast (q. v.), or some vege- 
table en casserole. 

Bake your cereal (using a little more water) for 
to-morrow's breakfast, or to be combined (for soup, 
or in some other way) for dinner, or for to-morrow. 

WHEN BOILING SOMETHING: 

Steam your vegetables, rice, hulled corn, pignolia 
nuts, etc. 

Make your gas bills smaller by using your thinker. 
The more you use it the better you'll enjoy your 
job, because the work will be interesting. 

Learn to regulate the gas (in two ways). 

(a) Proportion of air mixed with the gas just 
before it reaches the burner. Many people use a 
mixture much stronger than is necessary. 

(b) Size of flame. Most people use much more 
flame than is necessary for boiling and other cooking 
done on top of the stove. After the boiling once 
becomes active the flame can be considerably low- 
ered (gradually), without loss of cooking power. 
Violent boiling is seldom necessary. 

"Don't let it scorch !" is a false slogan. 

"JUST ENOUGH" to maintain the cooking pro- 
cess required is the real one. 

Whatever is made with baking soda may be put 
into a gas oven just as it is being lighted, to insure 
slow, steady rising. 

When a coal range is used, put things to rise for 
half an hour in a warm place.

FRUITS 



"Dead ripe" is 
too ripe 
for food 



Coarse fibers 
valuable. 



Pineapple eyes. 



Ripen your 
bananas. 



Use the skins 
for cleaning. 



For marmalade. 
For candying 



In cake, etc. 
in syrup. 

Canned. 

To flavor 
fruit drinks. 

Use less sugar 
and less heat. 
Get more flavor 
and more 
mastication. 



The moment after a flower or fruit has reached 
perfection it begins to deteriorate. 

When fruit is over-ripe it is rotting and unfit for 
food. 

For best results eat fruit a trifle under ripe. 

The skins of fruits should be eaten, as chewing, 
them encourages the saliva, and also because all 
coarse fibers in our diet help to keep the intestines 
clean. 

Grind the eyes of pineapples with dried fruits and 
nuts, and make jam. 

Bananas should be bought a week or two (depend- 
ing upon weather conditions) before using. This 
fruit has such a tough skin, and is picked so green, 
that ripening is difficult. Hence : Put away in paper 
bag, in moderately warm place, and use when skin 
is dark. 

Use the skins to clean tan shoes. 

The skins of lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines, 
and grape fruit should be used in different ways. 

They are good in marmalade. 

They may be cut into strips, cooked, and candied, 
to be used as a confection, or with other fruits in 
cakes and puddings. 

They may be run through a meat chopper, and 
cooked in syrup or brown sugar, and then used in 
cakes or puddings — or canned for future use. 

They may be soaked in water, and the liquor used; 
in fruit punch or lemonade. 

In canning fruits use as little sugar as possible, 
and cook for a shorter time. If the fruit seems a 
trifle under-done you will get the flavor, and give 
your teeth a healthy job. 



Cranberries 
and apples. 



For winter use. 



TAKE equal parts of cranberries, and cooking 
apples cut into pieces. Cook with enough water to 
prevent sticking. Sweeten to taste. 

Can for the winter, if desired.

TAKE tender stalks of rhubarb, wash, cut (not Rhubarb sauce,

or lemon juice for fruit punch. *'^"** punch.

Use very little salt. 

Use very little pepper. 

Use very little mustard. (A mustard poultice is 
better when applied externally.) 

Lemon juice is always preferable to vinegar. 

Only the very purest vinegar should enter your 
kitchen at all. 

Use rhubarb juice in season, and make your own 
rhubarb vinegar. 

A little oil (peanut butter may be included) is the 
best dressing for a salad containing an acid fruit. 

Evaporated or condensed milk, or a milk powder, 
may be used instead of milk or cream, provided only 
the plain, unsweetened preparations are used. 

TAKE 2 tablespoons rhubarb or lemon juice. 
Beat in 4 tablespoons oil, and % teaspoon salt. 

TAKE J4 cup sour milk or cream. Beat into it 
2 tablespoons (level) peanut butter, and ^ teaspoon 
salt. (If milk is used, use also 1 tablespoon oil.) 

If you have any left, it may be used in making 
cookies, bread, cake or mufHns. 

Should you wish to keep it a few days, spread a 
little oil over the top to prevent it getting too sour. 

TAKE J4 cup peanut butter or other ground nut 
meats. Beat into this (at first adding only a little 
at a time) 1 cup (or more, if you like) of olive, pea- 
nut, Mazola, or other good oil, and J^ teaspoon salt. 

This keeps indefinitely, and is delicious for salads 
containing acid fruits. 

Take ^ pound sharp cheese, and mash, grate or

HOW TO FEED CHILDREN 



You call the Let us people the world with a new race, by giving 

children *°*° the coming generation the right beginning. 



'Control"' means 
sanity, happiness, 
power, 
"indulgence" 
means 

distorted thiak- 
ing, 

discord, 
impotence. 

Train the bowels 
to function 
regularly. 

Not drug them 
into occasional 
and spasmodic 
action. 

Prevent 
constipatioxi. 



Water is necea- 
sary to health. 
The habit of 
drinking freely 
safeguards the 
health. 



To establish this 
habit is to pro- 
tect the child's 
future. 
If you love 
your child 
enough you will 
be firm. 

Milk should not 
be too rich. 



Let the mothers START THE CHILDREN 
WITH CORRECT HABITS, to make their COR- 
RECT LIVING (as our future men and women) a 
natural desire, and a FIXED HABIT. 

REGULARITY is a fine habit. 

FROM BIRTH, baby's bowels should be regu- 
lated without drugs. 

Would you whip a starved horse up hills? Or 
would you feed him? Drugs merely whip up the 
functions. They need TRAINING, not whipping. 

Often babies are constipated because the milk is 
too rich, or because they swallow it without mixing 
the saliva with it. If your milk runs too freely, 
harden the nipple with lemon juice. (Bottle nipples 
should have small holes.) Dilute the food. Give 
several drinks of warm or cool water daily. 

If baby cries before feeding time, give water or 
juice of sweet oranges greatly diluted. (As child 
grows older, dilute less.) 

If the little one doesn't seem to like water, omit a 
feeding and give water only for that meal. 

A wise and truly loving mother will think of the 
child's FUTURE, and will do those things which 
will train the man or woman of to-morrow. Water 
is necessary for baby's future health (and incident- 
ally for mother's present comfort). 

Bottle-fed babies will thrive on milk from healthy 
Alderney or Holstein cows, or from cross-breeds of 
either of these with either Jersey or Guernsey. The 
milk of either of the latter alone is too rich and 
heavy with fats.

There are many good foods on the market, and After nursing,

give the child some Oatmeal or Vieno Cereal Gruel the gruel, 
three times daily. Barley water is very fine for a 
beginning. Gradually increase the thickness of the 7^^^^^* 
gruel, until the regular porridge is taken easily. 

The juice of prunes, pineapple, or sweet oranges Fruit juices. 

should be given two or three times daily, right
