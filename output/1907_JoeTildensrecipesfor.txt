Introductory Note 



Major Joseph Tilden was in his time one of the most 
famous Bohemians and epicureans of the Pacific Coast. 
Ever since his death his many friends have been trying 
to learn the culinary secrets which made a repast of 
his devising so delicious. He had given his recipes to 
but few, and those few his most intimate friends and 
fellow spirits. One of the most favored of his old 
companions has given this complete collection of his 
recipes for publication. 

San Francisco, May, 1907.

half cups of milk and simmer for a few minutes. 
Have ready a soup tureen. In it beat the yolks

beating until it thickens a little. A slice of 
toasted French bread should be placed in each

Introductory Note 



Major Joseph Tilden was in his time one of the most 
famous Bohemians and epicureans of the Pacific Coast. 
Ever since his death his many friends have been trying 
to learn the culinary secrets which made a repast of 
his devising so delicious. He had given his recipes to 
but few, and those few his most intimate friends and 
fellow spirits. One of the most favored of his old 
companions has given this complete collection of his 
recipes for publication.

SOUPS AND 
CHOWDERS 




_ SOUPS AND CHOWDERS _ 

Onion Soup 

Place six ounces of butter in a large saucepan 
over the fire, and stir into it four large white 
onions cut up, not sliced. Stew this very slowly 
for one hour, stirring frequently to prevent its 
scorching. Add salt, pepper, cayenne, and 
about one quart of stock, and cook one hour 
longer. Then stir into the mixture one and a 
half cups of milk and simmer for a few minutes. 
Have ready a soup tureen. In it beat the yolks- 
of four eggs with two tablespoonfuls of grated 
Parmesan cheese. Stir the hot soup into this,

Introductory Note 



Major Joseph Tilden was in his time one of the most 
famous Bohemians and epicureans of the Pacific Coast. 
Ever since his death his many friends have been trying 
to learn the culinary secrets which made a repast of 
his devising so delicious. He had given his recipes to 
but few, and those few his most intimate friends and 
fellow spirits. One of the most favored of his old 
companions has given this complete collection of his 
recipes for publication. 

San Francisco, May, 1907. 



SOUPS AND 
CHOWDERS 




SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Onion Soup 

Place six ounces of butter in a large saucepan 
over the fire, and stir into it four large white 
onions cut up, not sliced. Stew this very slowly 
for one hour, stirring frequently to prevent its 
scorching. Add salt, pepper, cayenne, and 
about one quart of stock, and cook one hour 
longer. Then stir into the mixture one and a 
half cups of milk and simmer for a few minutes. 
Have ready a soup tureen. In it beat the yolks 
of four eggs with two tablespoonfuls of grated 
Parmesan cheese. Stir the hot soup into this, 
beating until it thickens a little. A slice of 
toasted French bread should be placed in each 
plate, and the soup poured over it. 



Palestine Soup 

Slice two or three Jerusalem artichokes and 
place in two quarts of boiling water. Cook for 
one and one-half hours. Then rub the arti- 
chokes through a colander and add to them one 

3 



JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

pint of the water in which they were boiled. 
Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed into 
the same amount of butter. Add two cups of 
milk and boil for ten minutes. Season with salt 
and pepper and serve with croutons. 



Black Bean Soup 

Soak over night one quart of black turtle 
beans in water to cover them. In the morning 
strain and boil them in four quarts of water for 
one hour, skimming frequently. Then put into 
the liquor two white onions sliced, two stalks of 
celery cut into bits, salt, pepper, cayenne, and 
one teaspoonful each of cloves and allspice. 
Boil for three hours. Remove from the stove 
and add enough stock to thin the mixture to 
the consistency of a cream soup. Pour into it 
nearly a tumbler of sherry and add a thinly sliced 
lime. Place over the fire to boil for five minutes. 
Just before serving stir into the soup three hard- 
boiled eggs, finely chopped. Force meat balls 
may be added.

SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Parker House Tomato Soup 

Put into a saucepan five pounds of tomatoes, 
either fresh or canned, with one quart of water, 
salt, pepper, cayenne, one and one-half table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and three ounces of butter, 
rubbed into one heaping tablespoonful of flour. 
Cook slowly one hour. Remove from the fire 
and rub through a sieve. Place over the fire 
again and add one and one-half tablespoonfuls 
of rice flour which has been dissolved in a little 
water. Let it come to a boil, when it is ready 
to serve. 



Celery Soup 

Boil one small cupful of rice in three pints of 
milk, or two pints of milk and one of cream, 
until it is tender. Then rub it through a sieve 
and add one quart of veal stock, salt, cayenne, 
and three heads of celery (the white stalks only) 
which have been previously grated. Boil until 
the celery is tender. 

5 



JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

Bisque of Prawns or Shrimps 

Boil three dozen prawns twenty minutes in 
salted water to cover them. Meanwhile in two 
small tablespoonfuls of butter, fry an onion and 
a carrot sliced, and a small piece of salt pork 
chopped. Take the prawns out of the boiling 
water and add to it the fried mixture with salt, 
pepper, a bunch of sweet herbs and one-half the 
prawns added again. Simmer one hour. Pound 
the shells of the prawns in a mortar with a little 
butter, to form a smooth paste. Stir this into 
the soup and boil twenty minutes. Strain 
through a sieve. Add one quart of milk and 
one teaspoonful of cornstarch stirred into a 
little of the cold milk. Let it boil up, and serve. 
It should be as thick as rich cream. 



Lobster Soup 

Pick the meat from a five pound lobster and 
pound it in a mortar, adding from time to time a 
little milk or cream. When perfectly smooth, 

6 



SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



add two teaspoonfuls of salt, one tablespoonful 
of chopped parsley (if liked), cayenne and mace. 
Take out enough to make a dozen small balls, 
mix this with the yolk of an egg and fry it in 
butter. Mix the rest of the pounded lobster 
with two quarts of milk and rub through a 
sieve. Put this in a saucepan and simmer ten 
minutes. Add two ounces of butter and stir 
until melted and smooth. Pour over the fried 
balls in the tureen and serve very hot. 

* 
Venison Soup 

Cut six pounds of lean venison into medium 
sized pieces and place in a soup kettle with two 
gallons of cold water, to which add two dozen 
cloves and four blades of mace. Boil slowly 
three hours. Then add two pounds of venison, 
cut into pieces about an inch square and one 
dozen force meat balls. Boil for thirty min- 
utes. Then season with salt, pepper, cayenne, 
and half a glass of lime juice, letting the soup 
cook ten minutes longer. It should be served 

7 



JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

in hot bowls in each of which is poured a half 
glass of port before serving. Crisp croutons 
may be added. 



Puree of Venison 

Cut up the remains of venison that had been 
roasted for a former dinner, put a few slices of 
ham into a stew pan, then the venison, two whole 
onions, a blade of mace, two quarts of stock, 
and a small piece of a sprig of thyme, parsley, 
and two cloves. Set it on the stove to simmer, 
two hours or more. Strain it off, and pull all 
the meat to pieces. Pound it with the lean ham 
that was boiled with it, the crust of two French 
rolls which has been soaked in consomme. 
Rub the whole through a colander with a glass 
of claret or port and enough consomme to bring 
it to the consistency of cream. Put it back on 
the fire in a double boiler. Stir a little butter 
into it, and serve with bread fried in dice. 

8 



SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Clear Soup Stock 

To four pounds of beef add six quarts of cold 
water and place over the fire. Just before it 
boils, skim it carefully. Then add two cups of 
cold water and skim again, repeating this for a 
third skimming. Allow it to simmer slowly for 
three hours. Then add the vegetables; eight 
ounces each of cut up carrots, onions and turnips, 
and three ounces of celery, with salt and pepper. 
Simmer three hours longer. The stock should be 
strained before using, and while cooking it 
should not be allowed to boil. 



Daniel Webster's Chowder 

Fry with some slices of pork, four tablespoon- 
fuls of sliced onions, to a light brown. Put them 
in a deep iron pot with six pounds of cod sliced, 
one quart of boiled mashed potatoes, one pound 
and a half of broken sea biscuit, fifty oysters, 
one teaspoonful of thyme, one teaspoonful of 
summer savory, one-half a bottle of mushroom

JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

catsup, one bottle of port or claret, one-half a 
nutmeg, one dozen cloves, a little mace and all- 
spice, one half a lemon sliced, pepper and salt. 
Cover with one inch of water and cook slowly 
until done. 



Scott's Chowder 

Cover the bottom of a deep pot with slices of 
pork cut very thin. Add a layer of fish sliced 
and seasoned with salt and pepper, a layer of 
onions parboiled and quartered, a layer of toma- 
toes sliced and seasoned, a layer of thickly sliced 
potatoes and a layer of broken sea biscuit. 
Repeat the layers until the pot is filled. Just 
cover the fish with water and cook one hour very 
slowly. Add one pint of claret, cook one-half 
hour longer and serve. 



10 



SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Marblehead Chowder 

Cut half a pound of salt pork into dice and 
place two-thirds of it in a deep saucepan; fry 
a light brown. Remove it and in the fat fry 
two large onions sliced. Cover the bottom of 
the pot with slices of raw cod or bass 
mixed with some of the fried pork and onions. 
On this place another layer of sliced 
fish mixed with a few pieces of raw pork, 
and slices of raw onion, salt and pepper; over 
this a layer of sliced raw potatoes. Repeat 
these layers until the pot is about two-thirds 
full, when the mixture should be covered with 
warm water, or preferably a stock made of the 
heads and tails of the fish. After the chowder 
comes to a boil, let it cook for forty-five minutes. 
Then add some broken sea biscuit, and boil 
fifteen minutes longer. In another saucepan 
place a quart of milk and heat it to the boiling 
point. Then stir into it two ounces of flour 
rubbed into two ounces of butter. When it 
thickens a little, pour it over the chowder and 
serve. 

11 



JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

The recipe will take about four pounds of 
fish, half a pound of pork, six onions, six po- 
tatoes, four sea biscuits, two ounces each of but- 
ter and flour and a quart of milk. 

A* A* 

Clam Chowder I 

Have one hundred clams still in the shell. 
Boil them in a quart of water until the shells 
open. Take the clams out of the kettle, saving 
the water in which they were boiled. Remove 
them from the shells, discarding all but the soft 
part. Take six slices of salt pork and cut into 
dice. Fry until crisp and a light brown. Re- 
move from the saucepan and in the fat fry four 
onions sliced. Then add the water strained 
from the clams and the fried pork. To this add 
six potatoes cut in small pieces and two green 
peppers chopped or finely sliced. Boil the mix- 
ture fifteen minutes before putting in the clams 
and four sea biscuits, broken into pieces. Then 
boil for fifteen minutes longer and add a quart

SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



of milk. Have half a cup of bread crumbs 
rubbed into four ounces of butter. Stir this in 
as the chowder heats after the milk has been 
added. When it boils, it is ready to serve. 
* 

Clam Chowder II 

In a saucepan fry two slices of salt pork and 
when brown, add four potatoes and four onions 
cut up. Fry ten minutes and add three pints 
of water, salt and pepper. Boil for half an hour. 
Then add one quart of clams from which the 
tough portions have been removed. Also two 
sea biscuits which have been soaked until they are 
soft. Cook ten minutes. For this recipe, 
canned clams may be used. 
& & 

Force Meat Balls for Chowder 
Take the meat of a good sized crab, a- tum- 
blerful of shrimps and a clove of garlic. Chop 
all very fine and make into small force meat 
balls with a beaten egg. Fry them a light brown 
in butter, and serve in any fish chowder or soup.

Introductory Note 



Major Joseph Tilden was in his time one of the most 
famous Bohemians and epicureans of the Pacific Coast. 
Ever since his death his many friends have been tr3ring 
to learn the culinary secrets which made a repast of 
his devising so delicious. He had given his recipes to 
but few, and those few his most intimate friends and 
fellow spirits. One of the most favored of his old 
companions has given this complete collection of his 
recipes for publication. 

San Francisco, May, 1907. 



SOUPS AND 
CHOWDERS 



SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Onion Soup 

Place six ounces of butter in a large saucepan 
over the fire, and stir into it four large white 
onions cut up, not sliced. Stew this very slowly 
for one hour, stirring frequently to prevent its 
scorching. Add salt, pepper, cayenne, and 
about one quart of stock, and cook one hour 
longer. Then stir into the mixture one and a 
half cups of milk and simmer for a few minutes. 
Have ready a soup tureen. In it beat the yolks 
of four eggs with two tablespoonfuls of grated 
Parmesan cheese. Stir the hot soup into this^ 
beating until it thickens a little. A slice of 
toasted French bread should be placed in each 
plate, and the soup poured over it. 

Palestine Soup 

Slice two or three Jerusalem artichokes and 
place in two quarts of boiling water. Cook for 
one and one-half hours. Then rub the arti- 
chokes through a colander and add to them one

JOE TILDEN'S RECIPES FOR EPICURES 

pint of the wat^ in whicli they were boiled. 
Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed into 
the same amount of butter. Add two cups of 
milk and boil for ten minutes. Season with salt 
and pepper and serve with croutons. 

Black Bean Soup 

Soak over night one quart of black turtle 
beans in water to cover them. In the morning 
strain and boil them in four quarts of water for 
one hour, skimming frequently. Then put into 
the liquor two white onions sliced, two stalks of 
celery cut into bits, salt, pepper, cayenne, and 
one teaspoonful each of cloves and allspice. 
Boil for three hours. Remove from the stove 
and add enough stock to thin the mixture to 
the consistency of a cream soup. Pour into it 
nearly a tumbler of sherry and add a thinly sliced 
lime. Place over the fire to boil for five minutes. 
Just before serving stir into the soup three hard- 
boiled eggs, finely chopped. Force meat balls 
Lay be added.

SOUPS AND CHOWDERS 



Parker House Tomato Soup 

Put into a saucepan five pounds of tomatoes, 
either fresh or canned, with one quart of water, 
salt, pepper, cayenne, one and one-half table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and three ounces of butter, 
rubbed into one heaping tablespoonful of flour. 
Cook slowly one hour. Remove from the fire 
and rub through a sieve. Place over the fire 
again and add one and one-half tablespoonfuls 
of rice flour which has been dissolved in a little 
water. Let it come to a boil, when it is ready 
to serve. 

Celery Soup 

Boil one small cupful of rice in three pints of 
milk, or two pints of milk and one of cream, 
until it is tender. Then rub it through a sieve

water and add to it the fried mixture with salt, 
pepper, a bunch of sweet herbs and one-half the 
prawns added again. Simmer one hour. Pound 
the shells of the prawns in a mortar with a little 
butter, to form a smooth paste. Stir this into 
the soup and boil twenty nainutes. Strain 
through a sieve. Add one quart of milk and 
one teaspoonful of cornstarch stirred into a 
little of the cold milk. Let it boil up, and serve.

sized pieces and place in a soup kettle with two 
gallons of cold water, to which add two dozen 
cloves and four blades of mace. Boil slowly 
three hours. Then add two pounds of venison, 
cut into pieces about an inch square and one 
dozen force meat balls. Boil for thirty min- 
utes. Then season with salt, pepper, cayenne,

JOE TILDEirS RECIPES FOR EPICURES

glass of port before serving. Crisp croutons 
may be added. 

Puree of Venison 

Cut up the remains of venison that had been 
roasted for a former dinner, put a few slices of 
ham into a stew pan, then the venison, two whole 
onions, a blade of mace, two quarts of stock, 
and a small piece of a sprig of thyme, parsley, 
and two cloves. Set it on the stove to simmer, 
two hours or more. Strain it off, and pull all 
the meat to pieces. Pound it with the lean ham 
that was boiled with it, the crust of two French 
rolls which has been soaked in consomme. 
Rub the whole through a colander with a glass 
of claret or port and enough consomme to bring 
it to the consistency of cream. Put it back on 
the fire in a double boiler. Stir a little butter 
into it, and serve with bread fried in dice.
