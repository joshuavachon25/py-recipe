PREFACE. 



iliU book Is tn many respects a continu- 
ation of the preceding volumes in the series, 
tt fulfills the designs that were intended but 
not finished before, more particularly in the 
second part which deals with the cost of 
keeping up a table. It is not an argument 
either for or against high prices, but it 
embodies in print for the first time the 
methods of close-cutting management 
which a million of successful boarding- 
house and hotel- keepers are already prac- 
tising, in order that another million who 
are not successful may learn, if they will, 
wherein their competitors have the advant- 
age. At the time when the following in- 
troduction was written, which was about 
four years before the finish, I was just 
setting out, while indulging a rambling 
propensity, to find out why it was that my 
hotel books which were proving admirably 
adapted to the use of the ten hotels of a 
resort town were voted "too rich for the 
blood" of the four hundred boarding-houses ; 
also, it was a question how so many of these 
houses running at low prices are enabled 
to make money as easily as the hotels 
which have a much larger income. At the 
same time some statistician published a 
statement that attracted attention showing 
that the vast majority of the people of this 
land have to live on an income of less than 
fifty cents a day. At the same time also an 
English author published a little book, 
which, however, I have not seen and did 
not need, with the title of "How to live on 
sixpence a day,* (twelve cents) which was 

Presumptive evidence that it could be done. 
n quest of information on these points I 
went around considerably and found a good 
many "Mrs. Tingees" who were not keep- 
ing boarding-houses, and I honor them for 
the surpassing skill that makes the fifty 
rents a day do such wonders ; but the right 
rein was not struck until the opportunity 
occurred to do both the buying and using 
of provisions from the very firet meal in a 
Summer Boarding House. 

In reference to unfinished work I take 
the liberty here of saying that the bills of 
fare In this book with the quantities and 
proportions and relative cost from the con- 
tinuation and complete illustration of an 
article entitled "The Art of Catering" in 
Hotel Meat Cookinff. K nowing how much 
to cook, how much to chargi% ho>r to pre- 



vent waste ana an such questions rmitec 
there are carried out to an answer in then 
pages. In regard to the use of French names 
for dishes it is necessary that a statement 
should be made. A great reform has taken 
place in the last ten years in the com- 
position of hotel bills of fare, and the subject 
matter of these books having been widely 
diffused by publication in the hotel news- 
papers, has undoubtedly had much to do 
with the improvement that is now obsenr- 
able. My own design was, however, to ex- 
plain French terms, give their origin and 
proper spelling, and to that end I had a 
mass of anec(k>tes, historical mention and 
other «uch material collected to make the 
explanations interesting. As a preliminary, 
I began exposing the absurdities com- 
mitted by ignorant cooks and others trying 
to write French, and before this had pro- 
ceeded far the newspapers took up and 
advocated the idea that French terms should 
be abolished altogether. If that was to be 
the way the knot of misspelling and mis- 
naming dishes was to be cut, there was no 
use for my dictionary work and the mate- 
rial was thrown away ; I followed the new 
path and it proves a plain and sensible one. 
At the same time there is an aspect of the 
subject which cooks seeking situations 
perceive and editors of newspapers may 
never think of, and that is that there are 
many employers whom the reform has not 
reached who will pay a hundred dollars for 
a cook who can give his dishes imposing 
foreign names more willingly than fifty 
dollars to a better cook who can only write 
United States. First class hotels which 
have all the good things that come to 
market avoid French terms. They that 
have turkey and lamb, chicken, peas and 
asparagus, oysters and turtle and cream 
want them shown up in the plainest read- 
ing; to cover them up with French names 
would be injudicious; but if we have but 
the same beef and mutton every day, the 
aid that a few ornamental terms can give 
is not to be despised. First of all it is 
requisite that those who use such terms 
should know what they are intended tt m- 
dicate and how they should be spelled and 
then they can be taken or left according 
to the intelUgen. judgment of those ca» 
cemed I. W 



COOKINQ KOR PrOKIT. 



INTRODUCTORY. 



The pleasing discovery has recently 
been made by the writer, in the pursuit 
of a new business, that the interest in the 
subject of cookery is universal and only 
wants the proper sort of instructors, the 
right kind of books and some way or 
making it known that they are the right 
kind to set everybody to trying their capa- 
bilities in this at once the most useful and 
most ornamental art. True, there are 
cook books already by the hundreds, but 
that is not all that is required, a greater 
difficulty than to write and compile a 
book 0!i the subject is to get people to 
read it, and certain pages or even cer- 
tain items that might be veritable jewels 
of knowledge at times to the possessors 
of the books lie there undiscovered. 

We have already tried the conversa- 
tional style in writing about cooking, and 
have reason to be satisfied with the re- 
sults of the experiment as far as it has 
gone. We have the satisfaction at least 
of finding that what has been written has 
been read, and what we have learned of 
our subject has in that manner been 
made plain to such readers as had need 
of the knowledge. 



Amongst all the commendations of oof 
published hotel book, the "American 
Pastry Cook," received from the work- 
ers who have tried and know , and some 
of whom have even written gratefully for 
the help ihey found in it, we have met 
no harsher adverse criticism than that of 
a fashionable caterer of prominence in his 
own city, who said that it was too good ; 
that if the author could make the arti- 
cles in it, and as good as described, he 
ought to be in a certain famous hotel, 
"where the best they can get is not good 
enough for them." 

This though not intended for praise, 
certainly was praise of the highest kind, 
for the book having the ambitious title 
of American Pastry Cook, and the vol- 
ume next to come being the American 
Cook, ought not to show American cook- 
ery and the American table to be in any 
repect inferior to that of any other nation 
or people whatsoever. That book does, 
and the whole work will when comple- 
ted contain the cheapest and best articles 
as well as the costlier kinds, but cheap- 
ness is not put in the foreground. 

It is now proposed to run serially in the 
Hotel Gazette a book with some original 
features, having the cost of each article 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



carefully counted ami all superfluities that 
are eet down as optional in other books left 
out of this altogether. It is to be a book 
that will show how to make money by 
cooking; a book suited to the wants of 
an immense number who live by board- 
ing others at the lowest rate compatible 
with respectability of appearances, and 
a book that shall be on the same plane 
of everyday life with the people in the 
smaller hotels and in private houses that 
the writer meets with every day. They 
do not run bills of fare, nor plan nor 
reckon up their- meals at from fifty cents 
to one dollar each person. 

A book of this character must recog- 
nize the great fact that there are infinitely 
more women engaged or interested in 
cooking than men; it is hardly too much 
to say that every woman is interested, 
and they do not need to be told that they 
ought to know how to cook, that ia ac- 
knowledged in advance, but, **oh dear I 
the toil 1 the dry uninteresting study of 
the incomprehensible cook books 1 " 

Said a lady laughingly, the other day 
in a parlor full of friends — a lady of 
wealth and position, the daughter of a 
prominent judge, and the wife of a lead- 
ing lawyer of that section — ' ' When we 
were married my husband said he would 
give me a fifty-dollar bill if I would learn 
tom;ke good bread. Wc have been 
married five years and I have not learned 
yet, but I think I can out of tliis book. 
1 am going to try to secure that green- 
biick yet!" 

Said another one the same day, and 
this one was extremely poor, the only 
worker in the family, having a sick hus- 
band — *'Now I find I can make things 
from my book that sell well in the win- 
dows, we will give up trying to keep 
boarders, that is killing us both and pay- 
ing nothing, almost." 

To meet the wants of thousands such, 
it is necessary to adopt the household 
cup and spoon measures where measures 
are wanted. Curious as it may seem to 
workmen these people in small hotels 
find one of the greatest difficulties of 
life in having to weigh and measure, 



very few possess scales and they do not 
realize generally that absolute success, 
and success every time depends upon 
the exact proportions of their ingredi- 
ents. As it is impossible for us to give 
exact proportions without a better stand- 
ard than the variable size of the cups 
in use we shall have to give a double 
set of measures, one by the cup and the 
other by pint and pound. 

Persons who practice from this book 
can find which cup holds half a pint, 
which is half a pound of water, and the 
standard, and always using the same 
can soon learn to measure as many 
ounces as they want in it by observing 
the difference of the specific gravity of 
each article used. Thus: 



No. 1— Cup and Spoon Measure. 



A CUP means the common size of 
white cup generally used in hotels and 
restaurants that holds -^ pint of liquid. 

Wateb. — A pint is a pound, a cup is 
J pint, therefore a citp of water is 8 oz. 

Milk. — A cup of milk is J pint, or 8 
oz. 

Eggs by Measure. — A cup of yolks 
or whites or of uoth mixed is ^ pound, 
equal in weight to five large eggs. It 
takes 9 whites to till a cup. It takes 
13 yolks to fill a cup. When you have 
yolks left over, it is near enough to count 
2 yolks equal to one egg, or a cup of 
yolks as good as 7 eggs because richer 
than whole ones. Water should be 
added to them to increase the bulk and 
make them capable of being beaten 
light. 

Eggs by Count. — 10 eggs average 
a pound : 5 eggs fill a cup. When there 
are duck, goose, turkey, bantam or 
guinea-fowl eggs to be used, iustead of 
counting they can be measured after 
breaking for cooking purposes by the 
above rule — i e, a cup of eggs is equal to 
5 ordinary hen's eggs. 

Butter. — A cup of cold butter is 7^ 
ounces, if pressed in quite solid. A cup 
of ibelted butter is J oz lighter. It is 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



usually near pnough for cooking to call 
a cup J pound. Butter size of an egg is 
1^ ounces. 

Labd. — Same as butter. 

Sugar. — A level cup of granulated 
sugar is 7 ounces — 2 cups is 2 ounces 
less than a pound. Although sugar by 
the grain is heavier than water, and will 
sink instantly the air spaces between the 
grains make a cupful weigh less than so 
much liquid. ^ pound of granulated 
sugar is a cup rounded up. The pow- 
dered sugar that is known as fine gran- 
ulated weighs the same, icing sugar or 
flomr of sugar is lighter, a cup is but 6 
ounces. All that can be scooped up in 
a cup out of a barrel of any grade weighs 
9 ounces. Brown sugar a level cup is 

6 ounces. Up in the mountains the cake 
receipts people have been used to, fail. 
It is all because of the sugar. So much 
sugar cannot be used at great elevations 
as at sea-level, hence the reason for be- 
ing particular about the weights. 

Molasses. — A cup of thick molasses 
weighs 12 ounces — that is three-quar- 
ters of a pound — half as much as water 
and 5 ounces more than so much sugar. 
Thin syrups, however, do not weigh 
quite so much. 

Flour. — A level cup of flour is 4 
ounces. A cup heaped up with all that 
can be dipped with it out of a barrel is 

7 ounces, nearly twice as much as the 
level. A quart of flour just rounded 
over is a pound. 

Bread-crumbs. — A cup of bread is 4 
ounces pressed in rather solid. A 
pound of bread is a pressed-in quart. 

Corn-meal. — A cup of corn-meal is 5 
ounces, 3 rounded cups are a pound, or 
a pound of corn-meal is a little less than 
a level quart. 

Oatmeal. — A level cup of oatmeal U 
6 ounces. All that can be dipped up 
with a cup weighs 7 ounces — nearly ^ 
pound. 

Corn Starch. — A level cup of starch 
flour or cooking starch is G ounces, the 
same as corn-meal. All that can be 
heaped in a cup weighs 7 ounces. 



Farina. — The same as starch. 

Rice. — A level cup weighs 7 ounces 
All that can be heaped in a cup weighs 
9 ounces. 

Light Bread Dough. — A rounded 
cup is ^ pound. 

A Basting-spoon means the pressed 
iron spoon about half as long as one's 
arm. The bowl of most of them of dif- 
ferent lengths of handle holds the same. 
Six basting-spoons of liquid are -J pint or 
a cup. It is the most useful measure for 
molasses. A full spoon of molasses is 2 
ounces. A basting spoon of melted but- 
ter or lard not quite full is 1 ounce, 6 
spoons brim-full will be -^ pound of 
butter. 



A Table-spoon 14 times full is a cup 
or ^ pint of water,''2 tablespoons of mel- 
ted butter is 1 ounce. It is near enough 
to count a tablespoonful ^ ounce of any 
fluid except molasses of which a table- 
spoon may be made to take, up an ounce. 
A heaping tablespoon of sugar is 1 ounce, 
G or 7 will fill a cup. A heaping table- 
spoon of starch is 1 ounce, 4 will fill a 
cup — starch can be heaped so much 
higher than sugar. A moderately heaped 
tablespoon of flour is 1 ounce, three fully 
heaped will fill a cup — 4 ounces. 

Of eggs broken in a cup, 3 tablespoons 
are equal to 1 qq^. 



A teaspoon is ^ a table spoon. When 
baking powder, cream tartar, sugar, 
starch and the like is to be measured a 
rounded teaspoon is meant. It is near 
enough in most cases to count a tea- 
spoonful ^ ounce. 



In the absence of such a table as the 
foregoing ready prepared we have found 
such questions the most perplexing of 
any that have been given us to an- 
swer. It looks now as if any of those 
who are opposed to scales and weights, 
might so well acquaint themselves with 
the capacities of one cup as to become 
accurate cooks, and safe from the dis- 
couraging effects of culinary failures. 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



SOME ARTICLES FOR THE SHOW 
CASE. 



2— Angel Food or White Sponge Cake 



WHITEST AND FINEST CAKE MADE. 



5 whites of eggs — or six if small. 

5 ounces fine granulated sugar — ^ cup 
large. 

2 J ounces flour — J cup large. 

1 rounded teaspoon cream tartar. 

1 teaspoon vanilla or lemon extract. 

Mix the cream tartar in tte flour by 
sifting them together. Whip the whites 
firm, put in the sugar and beat a few 
seconds, add the flavoring, then stir in 
the flour lightly without beatiug. As 
soon as mixed put the cake in the oven. 
It needs careful baking like a meringue, 
in a slack oven and should stay in from 
20 to 30 minutes. A small, deep, smooth 
mold is the best and should not be 
greased. When the cake is done turn 
it upside down and leave it to get cold 
in the mold before trying to take it out. 

When you have pure cream tartar 
from a drug store use only half as much 
as of the common lest the cake taste 
of it. 



3— Plain Glaze or Icing for the Above. 

4 tablespoons powdered sugar. 

1 white of an egg. 

Put the sugar in a cup and mix it with 
the white ot egg. As soon as the sugar 
is fairly wetted it is ready. It dries 
pearl white; takes but a minute to make. 
Spread it all over the bottom and sides 
of -'angelfood." 

Cost of material 15c., size 1 quart; 
weight 15 oz. 

The rule for the foregoing in large 
quantities is an ounce of sugar to each 
ounce of white of eggs and half as much 
flour. Those who deal in it largely say 
it is, or at least was before they got it 



into a regular routine, the most trouble- 
some cake they made, the tendency be- 
ing always to fall in the middle. They 
now use plain deep molds having centre 
tubes of unusually large size. There i» 
no difficulty with small cakes. But the 
whites must be whiipped quite dry in & 
cold place. 

4— Lady-Fingers. 

7 ounces granulated sugar — 1 cup. 

4 eggs. 

3 tablespoons water. 

6 ounces flour — 1 heaping cup. 

1 ounce sugar to dredge. 

Separate the eggs, the whites in a 
bowl, the yolks in the mixing pan. Put 
the sugar to the yolks and stir up, then 
add the water and beat with a bunch of 
wire 10 minutes. Have the flour ready. 
Whip the whites with the wire g^^ 
whisk till they are firm enough to bear 
up an e^^. Mix the flour in the yolks 
and stir in the white of eggs last. 

Put the batter into a large paper 
comet with the point clipped off", or into 
a lady-finger sack and tube, and press 
out finger lengths in regular order on a 
sheet of maniila paper. When the sheet 
is full dredge fine sugar over, catch up 
two corners of the sheet and shake off 
the surplus, and lay it on a baking-pan. 
Bake a light yellow-brown in about 6 
minutes. Take off by wetting the paper 
under side and stick the two cakes to- 
gether while they are still moist. 

Cost of material 14c.; number of 
cakes 6 dozen pairs, weight 18 oz. 

5— Star Kisses. 



8 ounces fine granulated sugar — round- 
ed cup. 

4 whites of eggs. 

1 teaspoon flavoring. 

Whip the whites with a bunch of wire, 
in a cold place until they are firm enough 
to bear up an egg, add the sugar and 
flavor and beat a few seconds longer. 
Put the meringue paste thus made into 
a sack and star-pointed tube or else into 
a stiff paper comet having the point cut 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



like saw teeth and press ont portions size 
of walnuts on to pans slightly greased 
and then wiped clean. Bake in a very 
slack oven about 10 minutes or till the 
kisses are of a light fawn color and 
swelled partially hollow. They slip off 
€asily whea cold. 

Cost of material 10c; number of cakes 
6 doz. , or according to size. 



6— Fairy Gingerbread, 
Wafers. 



or Ginger 



This appears to have originated in 
Boston where it is held in high favor and 
it is a sort of social duty to know how to 
make it. No eggs needed. 

1 cup butter — 7 oz. 

2 cups light brown sugai — 13 oz. 
' 1 cup milk — }t pint. 

4 cups flour — 1 pound. 

1 teaspoon ground ginger. 

Warm the butter and sugar slightly 
and rub them together to a cream. Add 
the milk, ginger and flour. It makes 
a paste like very ttiick cream. Spread a 
thin coating of butter on the baking pans, 
let it get quite cold and set, then spread 
the paste on it no thicker than a visiting 
card, barely coveriug the pan from sight. 
Bake in a slack oven, and when done 
cut the sheets immediately into the shape 
and size of common cards. This is also 
known as euchre gingerbread. la served 
in packs and eaten between games. 

Do it up in paper packages to prevent 
breakage, with one sheet outside. 

Cost of material 23c; weight 2 J 
pounds* cakes innumerable. 

7— Jelly Roll. 

1 cup sugar — 7 ounces. 
4 eggs. 

1 cup water small. 

2 cups flour — 9 ounces. 

1 large teaspoon baking powder. 

■J cup fruit jelly or thin marmalade. 

Separate the eggs, the whites in a 
good-sized bowl, the yolks in the mixing 
|)an. Put the sugar to the yolks, stir 



up, then add the water and beat up till 
they are light and thick. jNIix the pow- 
der in the flour, whip the whites to a 
very firm froth. Whftn they are ready 
stir the flour into the yolk mixture and 
mix in the whipped whites last. 

Cut sheets of blank paper the size of 
your baking pans, spread the batter on 
them, without previous greasing, as thin 
as can be, and bake in a quick oven 
about 6 minutes. Brush over the un- 
der side of the paper with water, the 
cake laid flat on the table, and take it 
off. Spread the cake with thin jelly 
and roll up. 

It makes it rounder and smoother to 
roll it in a fresh sheet of paper and keep 
it so until wanted, care being taken that 
the cake is sufficiently baked not to 
stick. It shoul I be observed that this 
and number 4 can both be used for the 
same purposes, this is the cheaper.' 

Cost of material 19 or 20c. ; weight 
over 1^ pounds; light and large. 

8— Cocoanut Gems, Cakes or Caramels. 



These very quickly and easily made 
cream candy drops we learned to consid- 
er worth having in our showcase through 
observing how rapidly they sold at two 
rival fruit and confectionary stands in a 
western city. They were freshly stacked 
up hi sight close to the sidewalk every 
morning, aboiit a bushel in each place as 
it seemed, and were all or nearly all sold 
by night. They may be found in most 
confectionaries under different names. 

1 pound granulated sugar — 2 cups. 

8 ounces grated cocoanut 2 cups. 

J cup of water. 

Set the sugar and water over the fire 
in a small, bright kettle and boil about 
five minutes, or till the symp bubbles up 
and ropes from the spoon, and do not 
stir it. Then put in the cocoanut, stir 
to mix, and begin at once and drop the 
candy by tablespoonfuls on a buttered 
baking pan. The dry dessicated cocoa- 
nut is the easier kind to work with. 
With ihe moist, fresh graten more time

shonld be given for the sugar to boil to 
the candy point. 

Leave a little in the kettle and color 
it pink with a iQw drops of cochineal, 
adding water if necessary . Drop a spot 
of the pink on each white cake , 

Cost of material 20 or 22c. Number 
according to size. They sell at 2Jc each. 

9— Pound Fruit Cake. 



Yellow but spotted with fruit. 

The staple every day sort of plum 
cake. The fruit does not sink to the 
bottom in this mixture. 

14 ounces sugar — 2 cups. 

14 ounces butter — 2 cups. 

11 eggs. 

18 ounces flour — 4 rounded cups. 

Mix the above the same as pound 
cake, then add to it, 



1 pound raisins. 
1 pound currants. 
8 ounces citron. 

1 teaspoonful baking powder. 

Use seedless raisins. Nothing is good 
made full of raisin seeds. Mix the fruit 
together and dust it with flour before 
stirring it into the batter. The cakes 
require ^rom 1 to IJ hours to bake. 

2 teaspoonfuls of mixed ground spices, 
cinnamon, mace, and alspice, can be 
added to the above if so desired. It 
changes the appearance of the cake, 
however, and renders it perhaps less 
saleable. But either way it is an excel-

Cost of material — sugar 10, butter

over six pounds, size a five pint cake 
mold full. 



Preserving Corn with Salt 



Cut green corn oflTthe cob and pack 
it in jars in layers with salt enough 
between each layer to form a brine 
that will cover the corn. Place a 
plate or board on top of the corn, 
cover the jar and keep in a cool 
place. 

When to be used soak the required 
quantity in fresh water for 24 hours, 
changing the water once or twice, 
then boil and season with milk and 
butter, or make into corn pudding, or 
fritters. 

The above method used to be uni- 
versally followed before canning, be- 
came 80 common. The corn is not so 
well-flavored, yet serves a purpose in 
some places. 



Kossuth Cakes. 



Make sponge drops large and thick, 
hollow out the bottoms, fill the hollow 
with whipped cream sweetened and 
flavored, and place two together. Dip 
them ill melted sweet chocolate or 
chocolate icin^ and place on an oiled 



dish to dry. They are a Baltimore 
specialty, are generally made to order, 
only for parties; the price about a 
dollar a dozen. 



Cheese Fondue, a la Savarln. 



It is one form of cheese omelet. 
Take equal weights of cheese and eggs 
and one fourth as much butter— that 
would be 3 eggs, 4 ounces cheese, 
butter size of a guinea egg. Grate 
the cheese, mix the butter with it in a 
pan over the fire, break in the eggs, 
season with pepper, scramble all to- 
gether same as scrambled eggs, but 
not' too hard, as the cheese becomes 
tough and ropy if cooked too much. 



Cheese Ramequins. 



Roll out pie paste, cover it with 
grated cheese, fold up and roll out 
twice more. Cutout like thin biscuits, 
wash over with egg and bake. For 
luncheons and teas.

THE LUNCH COUNTER. 



10 — Alamode Beef Soup. 



There is a well established favorite soup 
sold in the large cities under this name; 
whether any relation to beef-a-la-mode 
or not makes no difference whatever. It 
is especially adapted for a lunch, or to 
be made a meal of, being simply made 
thick and of course nutritious with beef 
boiled to shreds in it. 

To make 12 quarts soup take, 

5 gallons water. 

5 pounds soup beef. 

Shanks and bones, all the water will 
cover. 

An onion, a carrot, a turnip. 

12 cloves, 1 bayleaf. 

1 tablespoon salt. 

1 tea spoonful black pepper. 

Break up the shanks and bones, wash 
off in cold water, put them into the boil- 
er with the meat not touching the bot- 
tom, boil gently for 6 hours, then take 
out the piece of beef. Add to the stock 
the cloves and bayleaf and continue 
boiling until the water is reduced to 
three gallons, and the remaining meat is 
well dissolved, which may be three or 
four hours longer. Strain off the stock 
through a gravy strainer, skim free from 
fat, set it on the fire again in the soup 
pot; cut the vegetables or chop them and 
throw them in, and mince the piece of 
beef without any fat and add that like- 
wise. Boil 4 hour, thicken slightl^y with 
flour-and-water, season with the salt and 
pepper and skim off the particles of fat 
that rise from tEe minced beef. It is 
thick with meat and minced vegeta- 
bles. 



It is not much detriment to such a 
soup to have the fat remaining in it, 
exce])t the crumbs of fat meat that rise 
from the mince and spoil its smooth ap- 
pearance, but it is needed for other uses 
in the kicchen. 



To make soup eveiy day as easily as 
possible there must be a regular time 
for setting on the first boiler — the stock 
boiler — and a routine something like this: 

lu the morning when preparing break- 
fast and dinner, get the soup pieces of 
meat together. After dinner as soon as 
possible set the boiler fall of these pieces 
and the complement of water on the 
range and let it slowly simmer as long 
as there is a fire at night. Then the 
last thing at night, if warm weather, 
strain off the stock and set in a cool 
place till morning. But if cold weather 
and the stock cannot spoil in the boiler 
during the night it will be better to leave 
it and draw it off quite clear before the 
morning fire is started undei it. 

Good soup can be made by setting the 
prepared boiler on early in the morning 
and drawing off the stock at about 11 
o'clock, but it is not the best way for 
obvious reasons. 



Cost of material — rough bsef at 5, 
bones at 2, vegetables etc, 5, 12c per 
pound gaU. 

11— Cold Baked Ham. 



Scrape and carefully shave off the 
outside of a ham and saw off the rank 
end of the knuckle bone. It is an im- 
provement to soak the ham in water 12 
hours before cooking. 

Boil it in the salt meat boiler from 2J 
to 3J hours, according to size. Take 
out, remove the rind, trim a little and 
bake it brown and shining — about ^ 
hour. 

12— Roast Ham Bread-crumbed. 



Boil and trim the ham as heretofore 
directed. Mix 3 cupfuls of the sifted 
crumbs of dried and crushed bread with 
1 cupful of grated cheese. Brown the 
ham in the oven only very slightly, 
take it out and press upon it all the 
bread crumb mixture that can be made 
to stick. Put back in the pan and 
brown it in the oven carefully all over

SAN FRANCISGO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



alike, basting the dry places with a little 
clear fat from the pan. The cheese mixed 
with the crumbs acts as a cement for 
the coating, gives a rich color and a good 
flavor. A ham done this way is good 
either for hot or cold. 



Cost — A 16 pound ham at 12Jc 
$2,00. Loss by shrinkage, rind, bone, 
waste 6 pounds, 10 pounds nett salea- 
ble ham for $2,00 costs 20c per pound. 
1 pound of ham makes from 4 to 8 plates, 
or 12 sandwiches. 



13— Fried Oysters. 

1 dozen oysters. 

1 cup cracker-meal or crumbs. 

■J cup milk batter. 

Lard to fry. 

Lemon to garnish. 

Spread the oysters on a clean napkin 
and wipe them dry. 

^iix in a small bowl 2 rounded table- 
spoons flour with 6 tablespoons milk, 
gradually free from lumps and like 
cream. Be particular to measure; and 
use milk because it takes on a finer color 
in frying than if water is used . Dip the 
oysters into the batter then into the 
cracker-meal or bread crumbs and let 
them lie well covered for a while. If so 
preferred double bread them by dipping 
the second time in the batter and then 
in the cracker-meal again. 

Fry in hot lard about 3 or 4 minutes 
or until brown. Drain in a strainer, 
serve heaped in a hot dish and quarters 
of lemon at each end. 



14 — Fried Oysters in Haste. 

Where there is not time to dry the 
oysters take 

6 tablespoons cracker- meal. 

2 large tablespoons flour. 

Some oyster liquor in a small pan. 

Mix the cracker-meal and flour thor- 
oughly together dry. Dip the oysters 
out of their own liquor into the meal, out 
of the meal into the extra pan of oyster 
liquor and out of that into the meal again. 
Do not rub the oysters as the bread- 



ing will not stick a second time, but press 
them in singly. Fiy brown in 3 or 4 
minutes, garnish with parsley and lemon. 

Cost of material — with bulk oysters 
at 60c per quart of 4 doz. oysters 15, 
breading 1, lemon 1, 17c. Lard to fiy, 
2 oz for each dozen oysters either con- 
sumed or damaged 2c — total 19c. 

15 — Oyster Fritters. 



Mix one-fourth flour with three-fourths 
cracker meal dry, and have some oyster 
liquor or milk or both mixed in a pan. 
Put in a good pinch of salt. Dip the 
oysters out of their own liquor into tho 
mixed meal, out of that into the oyster 
liquor then into the meal again, and do 
80 twice more, giving the oysters 4 
coats. Fry in hot lard crisp and brown 
in 5 minutes. Serve in circular order in 
a dish and garnish. These keep the 
perfect shape of the oyster and the oys- 
ter flavor in the crust much better than 
if made by dipping into thick fritter 
batter. 

Cost — the same as fried oysters. 

16— Oysters Sauteed in Butter. 

Mix one-fourth flour with three-fourths 
cracker meal (or sifted crumbs of dried 
breadj dry. Dip the oysters out of their 
own liquor into the meal, press down 
without rubbing and give them a good 
coating. 

Put 1 ounce of butter into a frying- 
pan and melt it. Lay one dozen oysters 
in close enough to stick together by the 
edges. Fry carefully as butter easily 
bums, imtil the under side is nicely 
browned, then lay a plate upside down 
upon them, turn over and slide them 
back into the pan again and brown the 
other side. Serve them still caked to- 
gether on a hot plate. 

Cost of material — oysters 15, bread- 
ing and lemon 1, butter 2, 18c per doz. 

17— Oyster Pies— Individual.. 

These are covered pies of the usual 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



well-known form containing from 12 to 
18 email oysters. They are served in a 
deep plate with a soup ladleful of oyster- 
stew liquor poured around. The pies 
are about the size of a large saucer. 

To make 10 such pies take for the 
crust, 

20 ounces flour — 5 cups. 

8 ounces lard or suet — 1 rounded cup. 

1 cup water. 

1 teaspoon salr. 

Rub the lard into the flour dry, pour 
the water into the middle and stir up to 
soft dough. Spread the flour that re- 
mains un wetted on the table, pat the 
dough smooth in it, roll it out 2 or 3 
times and fold it up and it is ready for 
use. Cut pieces, roll out very thin and 
cover 10 pie pans. 

Then put into each 18 small oysters 
and the liquor belonging. Dredj2:e in a 
little salt and pepper and a little dust of 
flour rubbed through a seive with the 
fingers. Put a top crust on and cut oflF 
the surplus by pressing the hands against 
the edge of the pie pan all around. Bake 
about 10 minutes, serve hot as above 
stated. 



Cost of material — flour 3, lard 7, cost 
of crust 10c. With bulk small oysters 
at 50c per quart of 15 dozen — oysters 
50c. 3 pints milk and oyster liquor sea- 
sonrd 12c — total 10 pies 72c — say, 7Jc 
each. 



18— Oyster Pot-Pie. 



Cells well in the restaurant. — 

2 quarts small oysters. 
1 ounce butter. 

1 cup milk. 
Saltaud pepper. 

Crust made of 
1 pound flour — 4 cups. 

3 teaspoons baking powder, 
1 cup water. 

Drain the oysters pretty well from 
their liquor and put them into a 3-quart 
britjht milk pan. Mix the crust like 
making biscuit, but without shortening, 
and have it as soft as possible to be han- 



dled. Pat it out flat with the hands 
and cover the oysters. Bake 15 min- 
utes and thon introduce at one side a 
seasoning of salt and pepper — ateaspoon- 
ful of each — a small piece of butter, a 
cup of milk and a bastingspoon of flour- 
and-water thickening. Stir about, re- 
place the piece of dough that was raised 
up and bake a short time longer. The 
crust should be as light as a sponge and 
lightly browned, but the oysters not 
cooked hard. 



Cost of material- — with bulk smaU 
oysters at $180 gall. — oysters 90, butter 
2, milk 2, flour 3, powder 2. seasonings 
1, $1,00. Contains about 16 doz oys- 
ters, or according to grade, and crust to 
correspond. 

19— Chow-Chow— Domestic. 



12 large green tomatoes. 

12 cucumbers. 

12 onions. 

1 head cabbage. 

There should be about twice as much 
cabbage when all are chopped as of any 
one of the others. 

Chop them small, mix, sprinkle with 
salt and let stand over night. 

Then drain off and cover with weak 
vinegar and let stand 2 days. Drain 
a£ain and add to it 

3 quarts cider vinegar. 

1 cup grated horseradish. 

4 ounces white mustard seed. 
•J ounce celery seed. 

1^ ounces ground cinnamon. 

2 tablespoons turmeric. 

4 tablespoons dry mustard. 

■J pound sugar. 

4 green peppers minced. 

When well mixed set it on the range 
in a bright kettle and boil up. When 
cold it is ready for use. The above 
makes something over 2 gallons. It is 
a fine relish for the lunch t,able. Keep 
in glass jars. 

Cost — too variable for estimate. To 
people with gardens very little. Prob- 
able average 50c per gall.

20— Plain Pie Paste. 



1 level cup lard — 7 ounces. 

4 level cups flour — 1 pound. 

1 teaspoon Bait. 

Water to mix — % cup. 

•Drop the lard into the flour and rub 
them together until well mixed. Pour a 
•small cup of cold water in the middle and 
stir around gradually. Take the paste 
out while quite soft, pat out smooth on 
the table with plenty of flour under; roll 
it out, fold up in three roll, out and fold 
tip twice more, and it is ready for use. 
The rollinpj and folding makes the paste 
flaky and better than it otherwise would 
be, although this is not intended to be 
red puff paste. 

21— Suet Pie Paste. 



2 pressed in cups minced suet. 

4 cups flour. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Warm water to mix. 

Make the suet as fine as possible by 
first shaving in thin slices and then minc- 
ing very small with a little flour mixed 
in while mincing, to prevent sticking to 
the knife. Rub the suet into the dry 
flour, add salt, mix up gradually from 
the middle with water slightly warm. 
Take the dough out of the pan and roll 
out to a sheet on the table, fold over in 
three and roll out twice more. Pie paste 
made as above, then allowed to become 
very cold and rolled twice again is al- 
most as good as puff paste in flakiness. 

The time may be shortened by having 
the suet, pretty well chopped, in a warm 
room to poften, then pounding it smooth, 
throwing it into the flour and mixing up 
and rolling out without stopping to rub 
it in the flour first, which is a tedious 
operation. 

Cost of material — average for both 
suet and lard 12c; makes 3 or 4 covered 
pies large enough to quarter, if rolled 
tbiD. 



22— The Covered Lemon Pie of the 
Great Bakeries. 



NO EGGS NEEDED. 



8 ounces sugar — 1 large cup. 

3 ounces flour — 1 small cup. 

1 lemon. 

1 pint water — 2 cups. 

Grate rind of lemon into a small sauce- 
pan, using a tin grater and scraping off 
with a fork what adheres. Squeeze in 
the juice, scrape out the pulp, chop it, 
put in the water and boil. Mix the su- 
gar and flour together dry and stir them 
into the boiling liquor. When half thick- 
ened take it off and let finish in the pies. 

The above makes two large pies or 
three small. It is necessary to be par- 
ticular to get the right amount of flour. 
The mixture is pale yellow from the rind 
and sugar. 

Put top crust as well as bottom on 
these pies. 

Cost of material 10c — pies each 8 or 
9 cents. Cut in 4. 



There are some immense bakeries in 
the city of Chicago and one of them is 
peculiar in that it turns out nothing 
but pies. It has grown up to its pres- 
ent dimensions from being a mere corner 
pie shop, and even yet one of the firm, 
the working partner, bakes all the pies 
himself, indeed he says that so close is 
the margin of profit in the business that 
when once he was laid up by a spell of 
sickness the loss during his absence 
amounted to about three hundred dol- 
lars per week. Hotel keepers and oth- 
ers who have to hire mefficient help and 
who see things burnt up and wasted 
will understand how that might be; and 
then there is the important matter of 
Imying cheaply and well. 

The people of the present time are ac- 
tuated by all sorts of queer desires and 
ambitions. Some want to go around 
the world in eighty days, some want to 
walk a thousand miles in so many 
hours, and the grand goal in view that 



COOKING FOB PROFIT.

the owners of this great pie factory have 
set themselves the task of reaching or 
die in the attempt is the production of a 
million pies in a year. Two years ago the 
numoer turned out in the course of 
twelve months had reached to eight 
hundred and thirty thousand, and it did 
seem as though the remaining trifle of 
one hundred and seventy thousand pies 
might be compassed in the succeeding 
year, making it a round million in twelve 
months, however it was not to be. 
Whether somebody had a comer on 
pumpkins that year, or whether apples 
were high through increased shipments 
to Europe where pies cannot go, or 
whether pies had begun to go out of 
fashion, or strong rivalry with this firm 
had sprung up so it was that the sales 
actually fell twenty-five thousand pies 
short of the greatest pie year. Still the 
prospect is good for the firm to achieve 
the object of their ambition. The pop- 
ulation of the city is still increasing and 
no new or alarming accusations against 
pie have been started of late. This es- 
tablishment possesses six carrying vans, 
five of which are of the capacity of om- 
nibasses and are as finely painted. They 
cost five hundred dollars each, have 
horses to match and each van takes out 
five hundred pies at every trip. The 
customers are lunch counter keepers and 
restaurants, hotels and boarding houses, 
bakeries, groceriei? and private houses, 
all over the city. They run five huge 
rotary ovens of which the doors are nev- 
er closed, but the pies put in at the front 
pass around the interior on the revolving 
floor and come to the door again done 
and ready to taken out. Of course 
their pies are good or they could never 
hope to sell a million a year, and the 
sorts they make are quite numerous 
in variety. Still they are cheap.

h cup flour — 2 ounces. 

1 tablepoon butter — 1 ounce. 

Few drops oil lemon, or extract or

Spread thin bottom crusts on 2 large 
pie pans, put iu the sliced apples raw, 
cover with a top crust, bake ^ hour in

A grating of nutmeg can be added if 
desired to improve the flavor, and with 
some kinds of apoles it is an advantage 
to put in a spoonful or two of water and 
dredge a little flour on top of the fruit 
before covering. 

When puting on th'' top crust the 
quickest and best way instead of cutting 
around is to press both hands against 
the edge of the pie pan, turning it around 
on the table and so cutting off the paste. 
It closes the edges together and takes 
off all the surplus.

RESTAURANT BREAKFAST. 



30— Coffee. 



More coffee is consumed in this coun- 
try than in any other under the sun; its 
value is understood, its power as a stim- 
ulant to bodily and mental activity is 
appreciated and no other article of gen- 
eral consumption can be named of which 
the public are so careful to guard against 
adulteration as this. Packages of ready- 
ground articles are generally simnned; 
the merchants must keep the sacks of 
coffee, ready browned but of different 
grades in sight and a mill for it to be 
ground in before the buyer's eyes, and 
these straightforward methods are the 
outgrowth of more than mere personal 
solicitudes or defences against the small 
frauds of imitation or substitution which 
in the case of innumerable other articles 
are submitted to with careless indiffer- 
ence, they result from the feeling that 
the active business of the community 
cannot be carried on in the fast way to 
which the New World cities have be- 
come habituated without the stimulating 
aid of good coffee, that is to say of gen- 
uine coffee. For the potency of the ber- 
ry to refresh and impel to new exertion 
is not to any considerable degree depen- 
dent upon tbe method of prepanng it for 
the table. Coffee causes wakefulness 
when eaten raw, or drawn by long steep- 
ing in cold water, its effects are rather 
deadened than increased wben it is 
made into the pleasant breakfast bever- 
age with cream and sugar. Its energy 
is most expansive in the out door camp 
wbere, boiled in a camp kettle it is 
drunk by the pint or quart witbout milk 
and the drowsy hunters or travelers 
spring up and start off singing. 

There are the best of reasons therefore 
why no great success should be expecterl 
for any eating house that depends npon 
boarders who are free to change, until 
it is made a special matter of care first, 
to provide genuine coffee ofgood qaulity, 
and second, to have it made strong, 
clear, fresh and furnished with cream. 



pleasant to the sight, to the sense of 
cleanliness and purity and to the taste. 
Some drink coffee for the sake of the 
coffee, some. Rip Van Winkle's, for the 
cream and sugar, but the latter, if not 
already past work when they begin, 
come over at last to the ranks of the ac- 
tive multitude. 

The stimulation afforded by the cof- 
fee berry having become an absolute 
necessity it is a question only whether 
the coffee made is to be of such a sort 
that it must be gii^ped down like a medi- 
cine and a second draught avoided if 
possible, or whether sipped with the ut- 
most enjoyment of both its flavor and 
fragrance, and this is a matter that rests 
mostly with the maker who in turn is 
dependent for success upon the vessel 
that keeps it for him after it is made, 
for an improper urn will spoil the best 
coffee ever concocted in the course of an 
hour or two. The most important im- 
provement in coffee urns is that of fitting 
the inside with a stone jar which holds 
the coffee and keeps it free from metallic 
taint. It is practically impossible to 
make coffee to order as wanted, neither 
can coffee bought ofgood quality and made 
strong be thrown away when left over 
from a meal, but if kept in a metal pot 
or urn turns black and bitter, discolors 
milk and cream like a dye and has none 
of the fine aroma it had when first made. 
The substitution of a bright new tin 
vessel for the old and cankerous one will 
remedy the matter for a short time but 
rust spots form inside the new one with- 
in a week and the coffee gradually be- 
comes as bad as before. If the makers 
of stoneware or some harmless unglazed 
pottery would put upon the market coffee 
urns with faucets, and an inner rim to 
hold the hoop of a muslin filtering bag a 
remedy would be furnished for much bad 
coffee within the reach of those who can- 
not buy the costly plated urns with the 
stone- ware linings. When a good way 
of keeping the coffee so that it will not 
change to ink between one meal and the 
next has been adopted it will become 
worth while to lay a stress upon the se-

lection of the best kinds. Good Rio cof- 
fee is the most servicable, the cheapest, 
and in nine cases out of ten is good 
enough if well made, but those who can 
distinguish between the flavors will pre- 
fer Java, and a mixture of Java and Rio 
is generally satisfactory. The fancy 
kinds such as Mocha, African, or what- 
ever new names may be given are gene- 
rally peculiar onl}"^ in being the produce 
of young trees which after awhile bear 
the same old sort of coffee as other plan- 
tations. It is said that tliere is no more 
of what used to be known as Mocha cof- 
fee; nothing remains but a name. 



peated filtering through the coarse coffee

I turbed by boiling, and the coffee will

coffee is often made by careless people by 

this method. 



33— To Make Coffee— Restaurant. 



31— To Make Coffee— Family. 

1 heaping cup ground coffee — 4 
ounces. 

8 cups watei — 2 quarts. 

The most people who do cooking for 
profit cannot afford to make coffee with- 
out boiling, the full strength is not ex- 
tracted until the boiling point is reached 
and to make it otherwise more coffee 
is required or less water. However, it 
need not keep on boiling after the first 
heat. 

Have the coffee ground coarse like 
oatmeal, put it on in cold water and let 
come to a boil, then immediately remove 
it to the stove hearth or some place to 
keep hot without boiling and a few min- 
utes before it is to be poured off add \ 
cup of cold water. Coffee made this 
way half an hour before the meal will 
pour off quite clear without anything 
added to clearify it. 

32— French Coffee. 



Put a large cup of coarsely ground cof- 
fee shaken in and heaped up (4 ounces) 
into the perforated top of a coffee pot and 
pour over it 6 cups of boiling water. 
Kepp the pot at boiling heat without ac- 
tual boiling. When the water has run 
through, pour it off into another vessel and 
pour it through again and then once or 
twice more. Whatever sediment may 
have passed through in spite of the re- 



If there is no properly constructed cof- 
fee urn, pro vide a tin one having a faucet 
near the bottom, and a muslin bag run- 
ning down to a point hanging inside from 
a hoop that rests on the rim of the urn 
and is covered by the lid. Put in the 
coarse ground coffee — J pound to 4 
quarts of water. Keep a coffee pot 
specially to boil the water in, you will 
know how much it holds, and use it for 
nothing else. Pour the boiling water 
upon the coffee in the bag, draw it off at 
the faucet and pour it through again and 
again. Keep the urn where it will be at 
boiling heat almost, yet not boil. This 
is often very hard to manage where 
there is no steam-heated stand, but some 
way must be found if the coffee is to be 
good. 

W^here there is a regular-built coffee 
urn kept hot either by steam or gas that 
can be regulated at will, the way is to 
put into the urn the proper amount of 
water and the coffee tied securely in a 
muslin or canvas sack and there let it 
draw. 

The addition of eggs to the raw coffee 
if not postitively necessary to make the 
coffee clear seems to give it a raild taste 
like the addition of milk. It is most 
useful when the coffee is ground too fine. 

If eggs are to be used put the coffee 
in a pan, mix 1 or 2 eggs with a cup or 
two of cold water, wet the coffee with it, 
then put on in the big coffee pot and 
boil before pouring it into the filtering 
bag in the urn. 

34 — Cream Fop Coffee. 



Use the very small individual cream- 
pitchers that hold only 2 tablespoonfuls 
and serve one with each cup of coffee.

With this careful apportionment it is often 
found practicable to procure cream enough 
for the purpose where otherwise the serv- 
ing of real cream could not be attempted. 

Cost of co£fee with cream and sugar — 
with cofifee at 20c. , and J ounce or a ta- 
blespoon to each cup, and 2 teaspoons or 
1 ounce sugar and 2 tablespoons cream 
to each cup, and cream 90c., gall. — cof- 
fee 5, cream ^ pt, 6., sugar 5; 16c., 
for 8 cups or 2c. a cup for material. 



35— Tea. 



1 teaspoonful makes 1 large cup. 
4 teaspoonfuls make a quart of tea. 

1 heaping cupful is 14 teaspoonfuls, 
and makes 1 gallon of tea if mixed tea is 
used and allowed some time to draw. 

2 heaping cupfuls of tea is a quarter 
of a pound, and makes 2 gallons, or the 
Bame number of cups as a pound of cof- 
fee, or about 30 as cups are filled. 

There are many who claim to make 
2 J gallons of cofifee from a pound, and 
the same will increase the quantity of tea 
to the pound but it must be at a disad- 
vantage to the good quality of the arti- 
cles. It is probable that where a business 
is successful in spite of a poor quality of 
tea and coffee provided, it would be still 
more successful with that point upheld. 

On the other hand a great deal of dis- 
satisfaction is caused in hotels through 
an unsystematic way of making the tea; 
because there is really scarcely anything 
to be done that little is slighted ; a quan- 
tity of tea much too large is thrown into 
water that does not boil, in the hope to ob- 
tain tea the quicker, which is bad at first; 
but afterwards the tea becomes so strong 
that nobody can drink it. There should 
be a measure of some sort always in the 
tea box, that there may be no excuse for 
dipping it up by uncounted handfuls. 

When the tea becomes so that it looks 
like coffee in the cups, yet has neither 
strength nor fragrance and of course is 
unfit to drink» it may be partly due to 
the use of black tea, but it is the certain 
result of allowkig the tea to stand and 



boil too long, no matter what kind of 
tea may be provided. 

The best way to make tea for a lar- 
ger quantity than can be supplied 
from the family tea-pot is to put the 
measured amount required into a box 
made like a quart measure, of perforated 
tin, having a lid to fasten on, and drop 
it into an urn of boiling water, containing 
the right proportion, and then stop the 
boiling and allow -J hour for the tea to 
draw. The box must be large enough 
to allow the tea to swell and the water 
to circulate through it. Before all the 
tea is drawn off add more boiling water — 
a fourth as much as was used at the 
first — for the second drawing. On an 
average each person takes 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of sugar to each cup of tea — that is 
1 ounce. In some good restaurants the 
plan adopted is to give with each cup 
three lumps of sugar in a butter-chip or 
very small saucer; and a correspondingly 
small individual pitcher with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of cream. 

Cost of material — 4 ounces tea 20, 
sugar 20, cream 30; 70c — 35 cups tea 
for 70c, 2c a cup. 



36— Chocolate. 



Common unsweetened chocolate is to 
be used as the sweet chocolate bemg -J 
sugar is not strong^. 

1 ounce common chocolate makes 4 
cups. 

1 heaping cupful of grated common 
chocolate, is 3 ounces and makes 3 
quarts; it contains 7 tablespoonfuls. 

1 heaping tablespoonful of grated com- 
mon makes 2 cups as cups are filled. 

Chocolate must be cold to grate; it 
melts and runs when made hot. The 
eupces are marked on the cakes. 

To make chocolate take: 
3 cups milk. 

1 cup water. 

2 heaping tablespoons grated chocolate. 
Boil the milk and water in a saucepan, 

drop in the chocolate and beat with the 
wire egg- whisk imtil the chocolate is all

made to order whenever practicable, the 
milk and water being kept ready boiling, 
but if made beforehand should be kept 
in a sink of the steam chest or double 
kettle aud not allowed to boil again.

10; 4:1c for 18 cups 2Jc a cup— single 
cups cost 2Jc, 

37— A Restaurant Pot of Coffee, Tea 
or Choclate. 



A pot is a pint silver or crockery-ware 
cofFee pot that a person may order instead 
of 2 cups; the restaurants that charge 
10c per cup furnish a pot of 2 cups for 
15c or a pot for 2 of 4 cups for 25c of 
either coffee or tea, but 5c higher per 
pot for chocolate. 

French coffee, meaning coffee of dou-

French coffee with cognac per pot of 
2 cups, 3-fourths coffee and 1-fourth

Some Necessary Explanations. 



As we are starting out to funiish a 
ready-reckoning book that may in the 
course of time show the average or proba- 
ble cost of everything from a pie to a grand 
banquet and as the selling prices of many 
dishes in the restaurants and elsewhere 
will often have to be quoted, for suffi- 
cient reasons, we wish to caution ail 
readers against forming hasty conclu- 
sions as to the profits made in any case. 
There is not the least intention on our 
part of setting the buying and selling 
prices side by side for comparison, for in 
fact the cost of material is very often a very 
email part of the expenses of serving 
meals. What those expenses are made 
up of beside the cost of material it is 
outside of our present business to in- 
quire and these remarks are made for 
fear of any false ideas being formed by 
some readers who have never been in 



business but think they ought to be, and 
by others who may not know the differ- 
ence between gross receipts and net 
profits. 

As regards the accuracy of our esti- 
mates it is necessary to mention that 
great differences in the prices of raw pro- 
visions will be found to exist in different 
parts of the country, coffee is cheaper in 
San Francisco than in the east, salmon 
is not half the price of halibut, being 
only about 12c per pound when in Chi- 
cago it costs 4:0c and halibut only 20; 
eggs and butter take a wide range in 
prices, and so forth. Still as our prices 
are always stated upon which the esti- 
mates of cost are based .each individual 
can change them and amve at the result 
in his own locality. To cooks in par- 
ticular who seldom trouble themselves 
about the cost of materials and who 
proverbially are sure to fail when they gn 
into business alone through deficiency of 
that kind of knowledge, we hope to be ot 
great use by showing the necessity of 
being exact in weights aud measures if 
they would not double the cost of arti- 
cles made and render profit impossible. 

3&— Tenderloin Steak For One. 



Price in first-class restaurants 55c, 
including bread, butter, potatoes and 
condiments. 

Cut a slice from the filet rather ovei 
than under -J pound, and in thickness 
according to the size of the filet, notch 
through the outside skin with the point 
of the kbife, flatten the steak with a blow 
of the cleaver to rather less than an inch 
thick, lay it on a plate and brush over 
both sides with a slight touch of butter, 
broil over clear coals about 5 minutes, 
or as ordered, and season with a dredg- 
ing of salt and pepper while it is cook- 
ing. Serve in a hot dish ; pour over it 
2 tablespoonfuls of melted fresh butter, 
garnish with a few sprigs of parsley and 
place ^ a lemon at the edges. 

Serve potatoes as ordered ; if chips or 
French-fried they may be in the dish as a 
border, other kinds in a separate dish.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



Cost of material — steak 18, butter to 
sauce 2, potatoes 1, lemon 1, condiments 
2, bread 2, butter 3; 29c. 



39— Double Tenderloin. 



The diflferencfc or deduction commonly 
made when steak for two, of the other 
descriptions is ordered is not observed 
with tenderloins, but when a person re- 
quires a double one it is simply cut accord- 
ingly and so charged for. A steak to 
weigh a pound will take a fourth of the 
entire filet. Having cut it off the requi- 
site length shave off two or three narrow 
strips of the skin that partly encircles it, 
to allow it to spread, and setting it on 
end on the block flatten it with the 
cleaver. Broil and serve as usual. 

The filet consists of a lot of strings of 
meat loosely held together and to be at 
the best the steaks must be cut straight 
up and 'down, as a slanting cut makes 
course meat. At the thin end it is better 
as regards good eating to cut the slices 
not quite through, open and flatten them 
to make the usual size. This however 
does not answer for an unusually large 
or double sized steak, but the fineness of 
texture has to be sacrificed for the di- 
mensions. 



40— Tenderloin or Filet Steaks— Their 
Cost. 



The filet of beef is the long strip of 
solid lean meat that mns along the whole 
length of the loin under the back bone 
and between it and the kidney fat. 
When the loin is cut and sawn straight 
down to make porterhouse and sirloin 
steaks each one of such steaks contains 
a piece of the filet from 2 to 4 ounces iu 
weight, according to where it is cut and 
the thickness. It is the smaller lean 
portion that has the suet upon it. To 
make the tenderloin steaks of the res- 
taurants the filet is taken out aU in one 
piece. This cannot be obtained of all 
butchers but some, having a certain class 
of trade will sell tenderloins at from 25 
to 30c per pound. Those who buy beef j 



by the loin or hind quarter, and having 
sale for all the different grades of meat, 
also take out the filet entir»i should still 
count it at about 30c, per pound as the 
following calculation shows. An even 
weight is taken to make the estimate 
easy to change when the price of beef is 
different. 

300 pounds of loin at 12c costs $36. 
1-third of it is bone; 1-third is coarse 
meat and fat; 1-third is fine clear steak, 
including the tenderloin and the rest 
nearly equal to it. 

The bone is worth 2c per pound for 
soup — $2, 

The coarse meat and fat is worth 8c 
per pound — $8. Take these amounts 
from $36. the first price of the beef, and 
the fine steaks will be found to cost 2.6c 
per pound. As the tenderloin is ac- 
counted a little better than the rest and 
is in greater request it may be properly 
reckoned at 30c per pound cost price 
raw. 

' 41— Filet a la Chateaubriand. 



Price $1,25, or indefinite according to 
style of house. 

It is a large tenderloin steak broiled 
between two thin steaks over a slow char- 
coal fire until done through, with all the 
gravy of the three carefully preserved. 
The outside steaks removed when done 
only their gravy squeezed over the oth- 
er. Common thin steaks answer for the 
outside. Have them wide enough and 
fasten the edges together with small 
skewers before placing on the gridiron. 
Pour sauce of hot butter with salt and 
pepper in it around the steak, add paris- 
ienne potatoes and cut lemon. Truffle 
sauce instead of the butter, if desired. 

42— Potatoes Free With All Meat 
Orders— Their Cost. 



Two average potatoes, or -J pound raw 
make a dish. 

Potatoes at $1,00 per 100 are 60c per 
bushel and 4 middling potatoes cost Ic. 

The cheapest way, as a matter of 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



19 



course, is to serve them with tbeir jack- 
ets on or, as the French say and some- 
times print in their menus, en chemise. 
The next cheapest \? the saute potatoes, 
boiled first, peeled \\ lion cold and sliced 
into a frying pan with a little fat and 
browned more or less. Those pared raw 
and friel by immersion in hot lard cost 
the most. 

In counting the* cost of potatoes as an 
article of food it is necessary to estimate 
that they loose half their weight by 
paring raw, 100 pounds bought for $1 
will be only 50 pounds after pairing — 
that is to say if pared by the help, and 
the potatoes of a rough sort with deep 
eyes. Smooth potato s like the rose or 
snowball, pared by the person who pays 
for them may lose only a third of their 
weight. 

But potatoes boiled or steamed with 
the skins on will only lose 15 pounds 
out of 100 by peeling when done, or 2 
or 3 ounces out of a pound instead of G 
or 8. Where potatoes are used by the 
wagon • load these differences are of great 
consequence. 

Taking the orders at a restaurant as 
they come for plain boiled or baked or 
the forms in which potatoes are boiled 
before paring, and the fried and chips 
and perhaps broiled, and sweet potatoes 
it is a fair average count of ^-c per 
dish for potatoes and ^for lard to 
fiy, or 100 dishes potatoes free with 
meat orders for $1. 



43~Porterhouse Steak For One. 



Price in first-class restaurants G5c, 
including bread, butter, potatoes and 
condiments. 

The porterhouse cut is the middle or 
best part of the loin beginning an inch or 
two from where the filet begins near the 
last rib and extending back till the round 
bone at the pomt of the hip is struck. 
The porterhouse steaks are slices sawn 
clear through, taking both bone, upper loin 
and tenderloin. They cannot well be cut 
weighing lesb than a pound and gene- 



rally run from that to a pound and a half 
accordmg to size of beef. A loin yields 
from 8 to 12 such steaks dependiDg upon 
the thickness. The butchers sell such 
steaks at 25c per pound retail. 

Having cut the steak from the loin 
about an inch thick cut off part of the 
thin strip of the flank so as to leave 
about 3 inches length attached, chop off 
half the depth of the back bone to give 
a neat appearance without taking all the 
bone away, and carefully sever the out- 
side edge to prevent drawing up while 
broiling. Brush over with the butter 
brash and broil from G to 10 minutes or 
as ordered. Serve with a border of chip 
or fried potatoes. 

Cost of material — 1 J lbs meat (by the 
loin) 25c, butter to sauce 2, potatoes 1, 
condiments 2, bread 2, butter, 3; 35 to 
40c as the meat may cut. 



44 — Condiments With Meat Orders- 
Their Cost. 



The greatest expense is for the table 
sauces and ketchups — Worcestershire, 
Halford, London Club sauces and the 
like and tomato ketchup, and the next 
for olive oil, french mustard , and horse- 
radish, while the cost of the fillings of 
the cruet stands is merely nominal. One 
half the expense of the costlier articles 
may be saved by judicious management, 
by keeping the sauces sliaken up, setting 
them out to each order and then moving 
them to a back shelf, not inviting pro- 
miscuous waste. In a business of mod- 
erate dimensions the expense of table 
sauces alone will easily run up to $25, 
per month. Cucumber pickles are gene- 
rally included in the tree list of condi- 
ments but dearer kinds are • charged 
extra. 



45— Butter With Meat Orders— Its 
Cost. 



With fine butter ranging in price from 
30c per pound at the lowest to GOc and 
even to 75c at times, there is no protection 



20 



SAN FEANGL^CO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



against lofS on every meal served except 
in serving the butter in individual allow- 
ances in small butter chips. The neat 
way of doing this is to make the butter 
in individual prints, using for the pur- 
pose a batter stamp precisely like the 
pound size in common use by the far- 
mers only these hold but ^ ounce. They 
are in general use in city restaurants. 
They are like toy butter stamps in 
size and are imported along with other 
wood carvings from Switzerland. To 
make the prints, dip the wooden stamp 
in hot water, press in the tablespoonful 
of butter that fills it, and push it out with 
the moveable inside. 

A person at table who has not enough 
butter will call for more but such requests 
are not very frequent, and the plan ef- 
fectually prevents the eating of slices of 
high-priced butter and slices of bread in 
equal proportions. Fine creamry but- 
ter at 48c per pound is 3c an ounce. We 
calculate at 2 or 3c per order. 

46—Porterhouse Steak fop Two. 



Price in first-class restaurants $1,20, 
mcluding 2 dishes of potatoes, bread, 
butter and condiments. 

This is 2 steaks on one dish and one 
may be cut a little shorter than the other 
80 that with the broad part of the steaks 
at each end the one dish on which they 
are served will have a neat and even ap- 
pearance; the 3 inches of the flank end 
being seldom eaten, but necessa.y to 
make a large dish of a single steak. 



47— Sirloin Steal<. 



Price in first-class restaurants 45c in- 
cluding potatoes, bread, butter and con- 
diments. 

Either '*a steak with a bone in it" cut 
from the end of the rib roast down to 
the first good porteihouse steak, or from 
the loin thick end beyond th« last por- 
terhouse. Cut to weigh nearly a pound. 
Broil and serve with a spoonful of butter 
poured over, ard Twtatoea. 



Cost of material — steak 15, butter to 
sauce 2, potatoes 1, condiments 2, bread 
2, butter 3; 25c. 

48— Mushrooms With Steak Orders. 

Price in first-class restaurants 20 to 
25c additional each person. 

About half a can with each beefsteak. 
Drain the mushrooms from their liquor 
and fry (saute) them in a small frying 
pan with a little butter. Add pepper 
and salt. When they have acquired a 
slight color draw them to one side of the 
pan, put in a heaping teaspoonful of flour 
and rub it smooth in the hot butter, still 
keeping the pan over the fire, and when 
the flour has become slightly browned 
pour in the mushroom liquor gradually 
and a few spoonfuls of water. Shake 
in the mushrooms, let all boil up, squeeze 
in the juice of a quarter of a lemon and 
pour over the beefsteak in the dish. 

Cost of mushrooms. Canned mush- 
rooms are all imported. There are arti- 
ficial caves near Paris where the culti- 
vated mushroom beds are over s«iven 
miles long. Several difierent grades of 
the canned goods are on the market 
ranging in price from about $25 to $33 
per case of 100 cans (tins they are called 
by the English). The low priced article 
is made up largely of mushroom stalks 
and large open mushrooms. These have 
to be cut in pieces to serve with steaks. 
They do well to mince for mushroom 
sauce. The finer goods are mostly small 
buttons and are white, beside being 
more solidly packed. A third of a can of 
the best goods will generally make a 
better dish than half a can of the low 
grade. Retail price from 30c to 40c per 
can. Cost of mushrooms with beefsteak 
a^a above should be 15c, or according to 
buying rate. 

49— Oysters with Steak Orders.

25c, additional each person.

ter Bauce prepared the same as the 
mushrooms in precueding article or in 
detail. 

A heaping tablespoon of flour will thicken 
a cupful of liquor; only 2-thirds of that 
amount is wanted, therefore, put a 
rounded spoonful of flour and the same 
of butter together in a small frying pan 
and stir them over the fire until they are 
light brown and not in the slightest de- 
gree burnt. Then pour in gradually 
nearly a cupful of oyster liquor and 
water, stir to mix and season with salt 
and pepper, then put in the ^ dozen or 
more of oysters and when they are at 
boiling heat pour them over the steak. 

Cost of material — oysters 6, butter 3, 
flour and seasonings 1, 10c. 

50— French Pease with Steak Orders. 



51— Tomato Sauce With Meat Orders. 



10c 



Price in first-class restaurants 20c to 
25c additional each person. 

About J can of nease with each beef- 
steak. Throw away the water and put 
the pease into a small saucepan with an 
ounce* of butter and little salt, shake 
them over the fire until hot and pour over 
and around the steak. 

For pease a la Francaise the difi*erence 
is that a little cream sauce must be made 
first with a spoonful of flour and the 
same of butter stirred together over the 
fire but not browned, and a half cup of 
milk added ; then put in the pease and 
let it get hot. 

Cost of pease — French pease range in 
price from $25 to $33 per case of 100 
cans (tins), the quality varying from 
large mature pease apparently artificfally 
colored, to the **petits pois extra fins,'' 
which are very small and sweet. It 
takes a third of a can for a sirloin steak 
and J can for a porterhouse. Pease re- 
tail at 30c to 4:0c per can. Cost with 
butter average 15c. There are home 
packed pease to be had as good as the 
French at much less cost. The French ar- 
ticles are made green by the addition 
of a little richy salt to the water they 
are canned in. 



Price in first-class restaurants 
additional each person. 

Throw 4 tomatoes into boiling water; 
in three or four minutes take them out 
peel and cut off the green around the 
stem, mash them in a little saucepan 
over the fire and let simmer in their own 
juice. In another pan put an ounce of 
butter with a scrap of raw ham and a 
teaspoon of minced onion and when they 
have fried a minute add a small table- 
spoon of flour and stir until light brown. 
Add ^ cup of water or stock and then 
the stewed tomatoes. Salt and pepper 
slightly. Press the sauce through a 
gravy strainer. Pour it over the meat 
in the dish. 

Cost of material per order 5c — A 
cheaper quality for low-priced dishes can 
be made without butter; and also by 
simply stewing down strained tomatoes^ 
and their liquor until thick enough, and" 
adding salt and pepper. The last is 
probably the best of all but must be pre- 
pared before wanted, needing slow stew- 
ing down at the back of the range. 

52— Onions With Meat Orders. 



Price in first-class restaurants 10c to 
15c additional each person. 

Slice thinly enough onions to fill such 
a dish as is used to serve fried potatoes 
in. Put them into a small fryinjr pan with 
a spoonful of lard or drippings, shut down 
with a plate or good lid and let cook in 
that manner until tender — 5 to 10 min- 
utes — then take off the plate and let the 
onions get light brown. Sprinkle with 
salt. Drain away the grease, if any left, 
and serve the onions on the meat in the 
dish. 

Cost of material — the price of the 
onions and the detriment caused by the 
odor that prevades the establishment.

particular cut. Price in restaurants from

25c down to 15c, including baked, boiled 
or saute potatoes, bread, butter and sea- 
eoningg. 

A pound of round steak as cut by the 
butchers divided in three makes 5-onnce 
steaks, all meat, ot a size sufficient for 
an ordinary meal. Beat them out a 
little with the side of the cleaver and fry 
instead of broiling them with the scraps 
of fat in the same pan. 

Cost of material — with round steak at 
12c — meat 4, 1 potatoe -Jc cruet condi- 
ments -Jc bread 2, butter 2; 9c. With 
rough steak at 8c, Ic per order less, or 
a large steak ot 2 orders to the pound. 

54 — Cheap Beefsteak. 

After purchasers have been found wil- 
ling to pay 25c to 30c per pound for se- 
lected portions there remains a large 
amount of every carcass that will rate 
either at the 12J cent rate of round of 
biicf or as skirt or flank and buttock 
worth about 8c or of a cheaper grade 
yet, the neck and brisket. This may be 



bought at 5c, but it is half bone. If 150 
pounds costs $7,50 at 5c, when the bone 
is taken out it will be 75 pounds of clear 
meat costing 10c per pound. If the bone 
be worth 2c per pound for soup — as doubt- 
less it is, the 75 pounds is worth $1,50, 
making the clear meat coFt only 8c per 
pound. This meat is equally nutritious 
with the selected portions but is not fit 
for broiling, as it takes a longer time to 
make it tender. 

To make it good, slice it and lay it in 
a deep baking pan and fiy it with drip- 
pings or some of the brisket fat pieces in 
the usual manner, with a strong season- 
ing of pepper and salt and a small allow- 
ance of onion and when it is brown on 
both sides fill up the pan with water and 
let it bake in that manner in the oven for 
an hour or two. The water will be re- 
duced to brown gravy by that time. 
Add a teaspoonful of flour thickening. 



Cost of material — | pound of meat 
v/ith gravy and seasonings 3^, 1 large 
boiled potatoe ^, bread 2, the meal 6c. 



Chicken and Rice a la Valenciana. 

Take a fresh killed fowl. Cut in 
small pieces, braise for twenty minutes 
in a saucepan. Chop very fine two 
onions, with two dants garlic and a 
fagot of parsley; add to the chicken 
and braise for five minutes over a slow 
fire Then add one pint of tomato 
sauce and a quar- of soup stock and 
two heads of cloves. When the stock 
conres to boil, add a pound of rice and 
season to taste. Let it cook over a 
slow fire till done. 



Ladies' Lunches. 

For ladies' lunches a truce has been 
sounded to the expensive decorations 
of dinner cards, painted ribbons and 
bags for bonbons, The menu has been 
simplified. Chops with pease, a 
Spanish omelet (a delicious dish this), 



birds broiled, fried potatoes, mnsh- 
rooms on toast, artichokes, salads, 
champagne, cofi'ee and fruit: this is 
now deemed a very stylish lunch for 
ladies, and is not overloaded. Roasted 
almonds, salted, make a very good 
relish afier the sweets. 

Spanish Omelet. 
Place in a saut6-paa one clove of a 
garlic, a quarter of a can of tomato*^ s, 
chopped mushrooms and chopped 
ham; season with salt, pepper and 
cnok. Break three eggs into a bowl 
and beat thoroughly; add a half a 
cup of milk, salt and pepper and make 
an omelette in the usual way and 
place in the middle the thick part of 
the foregoing preparation; roll your 
omelette on a side dish and pour the 
remainder around the omelette and 
serve.

as necessary, with a slice of the breast 
upon each and dressing in the dish. 
This proportion can only be kept up -with 
plump turkeys of medium size large and 
very fat ones having a considerable 
weight about the crop and neck that 
cannot be utilized, and the bone cuts be- 
ing too large and coarse. Young and 
light turkeys, sometimes no larger than 
common hens although not fat are good 
for restaurant use, sometimes admitting 
of being served in 4 or 5 portions only; 
light, but a dishful. 

Pick over and singe the turkey, take 
off the wing pinions if a number are to 
be cooked together as they make a good 
stewed dish and are but little cared for 
when roasted. Wash, and stuff the turkey 
with bread dressing, truss the legs in 
the body. Put it in a baking pan wi h 
i\ handful of salt,the fat from the gizzard 
and some toppings of the slock boiler and 
a cup of water. Roast it in the oven about 
2 hours. At the beginning of the cook- 
ing keep a greased sheet of paper over 
it to prevent blistering the skin and re- 
move it later to baste and brown the tur- 
key. When done take it up, pom off 
the grease and make gravy in the bak-

skin it. '^ut the head into three 
gallons of cold water and boil slowly 
until the flesh is easily removed from

73— Pork Tenderloin Broiled or Fried. 



Price in first-class restaurants 35 cts. 
including the usual accessories. 

Pork tenderloins weigh from 6 ounces 
to a pound each. The large ones should 
be split part way and opened out and 
flattened; the small take two to an or- 
der not split. Season aud broil same as 
beefsteak well done, or saute in a frying 
pan. Serve with a spoonful of butter 
over and a border of fried potatoes. 

Cost of material — pork tenderloin 12, 
potatoes 1, bread and butter 5, condi- 
ments 2; 20c. 

74— Pork Tenderlofn With Fried Ap- 
ples. 

The tenderloin cooked by broiling or 
frying. The apples instead of potatoes. 



Slice two apples across the core with- 
out pairing or coring; dip the slices in 
flour and lay them in a large fryingpan in 
which is a little hot drippings or lard. Fry 
one side brown then turn them over with 
a broad knife. This is one of the things 
that IS done right only in a few places,un- 
skillful hands get the apples "mussed 
up" and greasy. Some kinds of apples 
fry well enough without flour. 

Dish up on the edge of the hot dish 
around the tenderloin, chop or salt pork. 

Cost — apples at .4c pound 2 apples 
weigh ^ pound , frying-fat Ic, 2 or 3 
cents a dish. 



75— Honeycomb Tripe Broiled or Fried. 

Price 35 cents, including bread, but- 
ter, potatoes and condiments. 

Quite a specialty in some restaurants. 
Cut pieces of about 12 ounces, they are 
nearly twice as large as the open hand, 
dip both sides in flour, broil in the hinged 
wire broiler, brush liberally with butter 
and serve the honeycomb side upwards 
with the butter in a froth upon it. Serve 
potatoes either around it or in a separate 
dish, according to kind. Can be fried 
(sawteed) in a frying-pan in a little but- 
ter after flouring in the same way with- 
out breading, but will not brown very 
well without the butter. 



Cost of material — tripe 12, butter to 
sauce 2, extras 6; 20c. 



76— Ham and Eggs— Restaurant. 

First-class price 45 cents, including 
bread, butter, potatoes and condiments. 

Medium-sized hams should be selected, 
the very small ones being too lean, salt 
and hard, and the very large not making 
handsome cuts. Shave off the outside, 
cut slices clear across, very thin, down 
to the bone, drive a skewer into the 
block down by the bone to steady it and 
saw through with a small sharp saw 
kept'for the purpose. This is a difficult 
and trying joo with a soft ham unless 
good tools are kept to work with, and 



COOKING FOR PROFIT,

the ham is very liable to be torn and 
hacked in a very wasteful manner. The 
elices of ham weigh from 5 or 6 ounces 
to 12 ounces according as cut. 

Broil the ham about 6 minutes, lay it 
in a hot dish. Fry 3 eggs, half turned 
over and dish them side by side with 
the ham. 



Cost of material — (allowing for waste, 
butt and^shank) ham 12, eggs 6. pota- 
toes 1, bread and butter 5, condiments 
1; 25c. 



77— Omelet With Jelly. 



First-class price, omelet with 3 eggs 
25 cents. 

Break 3 eggs into a bowl, put in with 
them 3 tablespoons milk. Beat to mix 
but not to make it too light. Put a 
bastingspoonful of the clear part of melted 
butter, into the frying pan, pour in the 
omelet without waiting for the butter to 
^ get hotand discolored, let cook gradually, 
shaking it frequently to the further side 
of the pan until the thin edge, forced up- 
ward, faUs over ioto the middle. When 
it is nicely browned and the upppr side 
just set, put current jelly or other fruit 
jelly in a long line in the middle that is 
made hollow in the further side of the 
pan for the purpose. Roll so as to shut 
in the jelly, slide it smooth side up on to 
a hot dish, dredge powdered sugar on 
ton and mark it with slanting cross-bars 
by touching the sugar with a red-hot 
wire or spoon handle. 

Cost of material— eggs 8, butter to fry 
3, jelly 5, sugar 1; 17c. 

78— Omelet With Oysters. 

Frist-class price 50 cents, made with 

^ dozen large oysters. 

3 eggs. 

Milk, butter, seasonings. 

Cook the oysters rare done in a little 
saucepan separately, with a spoonful of 
milk, scrap of butter aud thickening to 
make white sauce of the liquor. 



Break the eggs in a bowl, put in a 
spoonful of milk and beat with the wire 
e^^ whisk. Add a pinch of salt. 

Shake a tablespoonful of melted lard 
or clear butter about in the omelet frying 
pan and before it gets very hot pour in 
the omelet and let it cook rather slowly. 

Properly made omelets are not exactly 
rolled up, but there is a knack, to be 
learned of shaping them in the pan by 
shaking while cooking into one side of it, 
the side farthest from you, while you 
keep the handle toward you raised high- 
er. Loosen the edges with a knife when 
it is nearly cooked enough to shake. ' 

When the omelet is nearly done to the 
center place the oysters with i spoon in 
the hollow middle and pull over the fur- 
ther edge to cover them in. Slide on to 
the dish, smooth side up. Garnish with 
parsley and lemon. 

One reason of omelets and all fried 
eggs sticking to the frying pan is allow- 
ing the pan to get too hot. They seldom 
stick when poured into a pan that is 
only kept warm till wanted. The pans 
should be kept for no other purpose, and 
be rubbed smooth after using, if not 
bright. 

Cost of material — oysters 10, eggs 8, 
butter, sauce, seasonins^s 4, garnish 2, 
table extras 6; 30c. 

79— Oyster Omelet. 



iilake the omelet according to direc- 
tions preceding and pour over it when 
done and in the dish the oysters cut in 
pieces in a brown sauce as follows. 

Put a large J cup of oysters into a 
frying-pan with their liquor, and salt 
and pepper and keep them in motion by 
shaking over the fire until they are soft- 
cooked. Take up with a skimmer and 
cut them in pieces. 

Stir a heaping teaspoon of sifted flour 
and twice the measure of butfer together 
in a very small saucepan over the fire 
until light brown, add J cup milk aud 
the cooked oyster liquor, if any, and 
when it has boiled up put in the cut oys- 



30 



SAN FBANGISGO HOTEL OAZETTirS 



tere. Add the juice of a quarter of 
lemon. 

The above brown oyster sauce should 
be prepared before the omelet, is cooked 
as omelets are not good unless eaten as 
soon as done. 

Cost, the same as omelet with oysten? 
preceding. J cup oysters is ^ doz large. 

80~Liver and Bacon Broiled.. 

First-class price 35 cents, including 
potatoes, bread, butter and condiments. 

i pound slice of calfs liver. 

3 ounces breakfast bacon. 

Cut the liver broad and thin, pepper 
and salt, dip both sides in flour, broil 
and while it is cooking brush it over 
with soft butter. 

Fry the 2 slices of bacon first, then 
finish on the gridiron. Serve the liver 
with the butter frothing upon it, the ba- 
con on top and potatoes around in the 
dish. 



Coot of material. The supply of call's 
liver is never equal to the demand and 
the butchers easily get 25c per pound. 
Beef liver has to be the main reliance 
for this dish and can be had much 
cheaper. Liver average 10, bacon (al- 
lowing for waste in cutting) 6, butter 1, 
potatoes 1, bread, butter, etc. 5; 23c. 

81— Welsh Rarebit or Canapes au 
Fromage. 

First-class price 40 cents. 

4 to G ounces good cheese. 

Butter size of an egg — 2 ounces. 

J cup of ale. 

2 yolks of eggs. 

Little cayenne and salt. 

4 thin pieces of toast. 

Chop the cheese small, throw it and 
tho butter into a little saucepan and as 
they get warm mash them together. 
When softened add the yolks and ale 
and pinch of cayenne and salt. Stir till 
it is creamy, but do not let it boil, for 
that would spoil it. Place th** pHcpa of 



toast on a dish, pour the creamed cheese 
upon them and set inside the oven about 
two minutes. The ale only heightens 
the flavor, and some prefer to use milk. 

The simplest form of Welsh rarebit is 
a slice of cheese placed on a slice of 
bread and baked in the oven. It de- 
pends upon the quality of the cheese a good 
deal whether it will prove satisfactory. 

And an addition to canapes au from- 
age is sometimes made in the form of a 
nicely-poached eg* on the top of each 
canape, in the hot cheese. This dish 
then goes by the fanciful name of the 
"golden buck" — at least it has been so 
named in a few places where price was 
no object and specialties paid. 

Cost of material — cheese 8, butter 4, 
ale 4, eggs 5, toast 1, table extras 4; 
26c. 

With poached eggs on top, cost 
creased and price indefinite. 

82— Minced Potatoes. 



m- 



This likewise has been a restaurant 
specialty and has been known as of 
great effect in drawing trade. It ought 
to be observed, however, that it takes a 
considerable allowance o^ butter in the 
pan to give the potatoes the fine yellow- 
brown, and appetizing flavor that will 
draw the people from a distance of many 
blocks to breakfast or supper. 

Chop cold boiled potatoes quite fine 
and season with salt. Spread a spoon- 
ful of drippings or butter in an omelet- 
pan or small frying-pan and plac*^ the 
minced potatoes about an inch deep. 
Cook on top of the range like a cake, 
without stirring. Invert a plate that 
just fits the pan over the potatoes. Let 
them brown nicely and slowly, then turn 
over on to the plate. Push in the edge 
a little all around and serve on the same 
plate with the brown on top. There are 
oval shaped pans that make these suita- 
ble for a platter, and even in the round 
frying-pan it can be managed to give the 
cake the platter shape.

83— Corn Meal Mush and Milk. 



One of the floating parag^raphs of the 
day is concerning a noted British journa- 
list who cannot bring himself to like com 
meal and says unfavorable things about it 
Bnch as paying it is nothing but oatmeal 
with a flavor of mice. He has evidently 
been trying yellow meal, and probably 
that not properly cooked. An early 
training "down south" convinced the 
writer of these lines that there is much 
more in com meal than is generally sup- 
posed, and various people who have 
tried his methods have expressed a 
pleased surprise. It is no use, however, 
to try to gain favor tor yellow com meal. 
Its strong flavor may be agreeable to 
such as have been accustomed to it since 
childhood, but their preferences will not 
be shared by many. Always use white 
com meal, coarsely ground and free from 
flour, make the mush with all the water 
it will take up, have it as soft and jelly- 
like to fry as it can well be cut and 
handled when cold; be careful to salt it 
right and fry it handsomely and you will 
find com meal in its different forms of 
mush jnd milk, fried mush, com bread, 
muffins, batter-cakes, com meal pud- 
dings, and others, an article so pleasant 
to the palate that it soon comes to be re- 
garded as one of the indispensibles. 
While it is true the negro cooks of the 
south have had almost the monopoly of 
the art of cooking com meal it will not do 
to admit that what they accomplish 
through the simple habit of doing, cannot 
as well be done by the exercise of intelli- 
gent judgement. Take 



2 heaping cnps white com meal, 

8 cups water. 

1 rounded tablespoon salt. 

Where the mush has to be made on a 
cook stove, a cast pot with feet, to raise 
the bottom an inch from the fire, is the 
best vessel to use. It lessens the ten- 
dency to bum and reduces tlie waste if 
the inside is brushed over with a touch 
of lard or drippings. Put the salt in the 
water, boil, and sprinkle the dry meal 
in with one hand while you beat with an 
egg-beater or spoon in the other. Put 
on the lid, and let simmer with the steam 
shut in for about three hours. 

If carefully cooked wiih a lid on and 
not bumt there will be as much mush as 
there was water put in, that is two 
quarts. 

Double the quantity needed for one 
meal should be made and" half put away 
to become cold to fry. For this purpose 
very slightly grease a pan, press the 
mush in evenly, and slightly brush over 
with melted lard again. No matter how 
little the grease, it prevents the forma- 
tion i»f a crust by drying on top. 

Each quart of cold mush will cut into 
about ten slices or blocks for frying. 



Cost of mush and milk— com meal 4, 
milk 2 quarts 16—20 cents for 8 half 
pmtb milk and 8 half pints mush or 2^ 
each pint bowl. 



Note — mush and milk served as a 
first course for supper or breakfast in 
hotels is but a spoonful in each bowl; 
perhaps a third, or less, of the restau- 
rant bowl above specified. 



Hominy MufRns. 

Pound one pint of cold boiled 
hominy to a smooth paste, add to it 
half a pint of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, a heaping tabl*»spoonful of 
baking powder. Beat the yolks and 
whites of two eggs separately, add to 



the yolks two ounces of butter, same 
of sugar, and a scant pint of luke- 
warm milk. Mix these ingredients 
together and stir into the flour, mix 
quickly, pour the batter into hot, weil- 
buttered muffin rings, and bake in a 
quick oven.

SAN FBANCISGO MOTEL GAZETTES 



HOTEL BRE AKFAS T DISHES. 

84-^'Old-Fashioned" Broiled Beef- 
steak and Gravy. 



Take a whole Birloin or other steak as 
cut by the butcher, notch the edges to 
prevent curling up on the gridiron and 
beat it out on the block more or less ac- 
cording to its thickness or the greater or 
less tenderness of the meat, for the ex- 
perienced cook is ble to imnroye a poor 
steak considerably. 

Put a shovelful of charcoal m the ash 
pan of the range and some live coals from 
the fire on that, cover with a pan or oth- 
er means of making a draft over the 
coals. Rub the bars of the griduron with 
a piece of bacon rind, lay the whole 
steak upon it and cook medium well 
done over the charcoal when it has 
burned clear. Have a piece of butter 
ready in a tin pan with a heaping tea- 
spoon of good black pepper and two cf 
salt, put in the hot steak and press it 
into the butter, making the gravy run 
out, add half a cup of Hot water, set the 
pan and contents over the coals and 
when it begins to simmer the gravy and 
pepper will have thickened the water 
and made a good gravy. 

Dish up on a large hot platter, carve 
in pieces about the size of two or three 
fingers and serve a spoonful of the gravy 
with each cut. 

The next thing to broiling for that kind 
of beefsteak is frying over the fire, but a 
little piece in a pan does not come out 
natural-looking, but bums around the 
edges — it must be a full pan or nothing. 

Good broiling can be done in a hinged 
wire broiler set over the open hole of a 
stove, but forethought is required to let 
the fire bum down to a bed of glowing 
coals in time for it, and to tum the dam- 
per so that the draft will be strong 
enoug,b to carry tbe smoke up the chim- 
ney. Some families and others are 
made miserable by having their so-called 
broiled meats always tasting of smoke 
and coal smoke at that. This is some- 



thing that calls for the exercise of com- 
mon sense. 

Cost of family beefsteak and gravy — 
2 pounds steak at 12c loses one-fourth 
bone, fat and cooking, 24 ounces costs 
24 cents, — butter and seasoninp- 8 — 3 
ounces of meat to each order, 32 cents 
for 8 orders or 4c each person. 

85— Indiv idual Be efsteaks. 

This method practiced by a domestic 
cook has been known to give extreme 
satisfaction to a large houseful of people 
when a so-called first-class cook had ut^ 
terly failed to fill the requirements of the 
place. 

Order the steak from the butcher cut 
thin, and divide it in pieces weighing 2 
ounces — about the size of 4 fingers. Lay 
your steak on a board of hard wood 
and pound it down thin with the hack 
edge of a heavy knife. Fry the steaks 
as wanted in frying pans slightly greased 
and let cook only 2 or 3 minutes and 
send in hot without gravy. All the 
merit of this plan is in the sort of blunt 
chopping with the knife-back, that 
spreads out the meat, gristle and all as 
thin as the edge of a dinner plate, 

86— Minced Beefsteak. 



4J cups lean beef minced 

1^ cnps beef fat minced. 

^ cup cold water. 

1 heaping teaspoon salt. 

Same of black pepper. 

Or, 3 pounds meat, one fourth of it 
tat, chopped and seasoned like sausage 
and a little water added. 

Take the thick part of beef flank or 
any that is tender but that looks too 
stringy and rough for steaks, cut both 
lean and fat clear of such skin and gris- 
tle as will not chop nicely. Mince it in 
a bowl and when finished and seasoned 
press it in a 2 quart pan and when to be 
cooked cut in slices like beefsteaks and 
fry on both sides, and serve with its own 
gravy poured over it. It should be made 
fresh every day. 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



33 



Cost — indefinite. It is an expedient 
for using up the best part of an unhandy 
piece of meat in a way that saves buying 
perhaps a first-class steak, while the 
pieces that cannot be minced are used to 
make soup or stew. 

87— P lain O melet 

Two eggs and one teaspoonful of milk. 
Add a pineh of salt, beat in a bowl 
enough to thoroughly mix but not make 
ir too light, as if the omelet rises like a 
souffle it will go down again, so much 
the worse. 

Pour into a small frying pan, or ome- 
let pan, in which is one tablespoonful of 
the clear part of melted butter, and fry 
like tried eggs. But when partly set 
run a knife point around to loosen it and 
begin to shake the omelet over to the 
farther side of the pan until the thin 
further edge forced upward falls buck 
into the omelet.. When the under side 
has a good color, and the middle is iicar- 
ly set, roll the brown side uppermost, 
with a knife to help, and slide the omelet 
on to a hot dish. Serve immediately 
while it is light and soft. 

88— Omel et wit h Parsley. 

Mix a tablespoonful of minced parsley 
with the omelet mixture while beating it 
up. Make as directed in the preceding 
article. 



89— Omelet with Onions and Parsley. 

Mince two table spoonfuls of onion and 
fry it in a little lard in a frying-pan with 
a plate inverted upon it. In five min- 
utes take up the minced onion without 
grease and add it to the omelet mixture 
made ready with parsley in it; stir up 
and fry as directed in plain omelet. 

90— OmeleTwith Ham. 

Have ready on the table some grated 
or minced lean ham in a dish. Pour a 
plain omelet of two eggs into the frying- 
pan and strew over the surface about 
a tablespoonful of the grated ham. 



91— Omelet with Cheese. 



^lake in the same manner as ham om- 
elet, with grated cheese instead of ham, 

92— Omelet with Tomatoes. 



Stew tomatoes down nearly dry, sea- 
son with butter, pepper and salt. In- 
close a spoonful in the middle of an om- 
elet according to the preceeding exam- 
ples. 

Cost of omelets. Omelets are kept 
off the bill of fare more on account of the 
time and attention required to cook them 
properly than because of their cost whioh 
is only from ^c to Ic more than the eggs 
alone would be. This is speaking of 
hotel and family orders where the added 
seasoning^ is but about a tablespoonful, 
and not of omelets with asparagus, 
points or other rarities. Eggs vary in 
price from 6 cents per dozen in country 
places to 60 cents in the cities at mid- 
winter. 



93— Scrambled Eggs. 

Not to be beaten up like an omelet 
but only stirred about. Put a spoonful 
of melted butter or butter and lard into 
the small frying-pan, and then two eggs, 
sprinkle pepper and salt. Stir the eggs 
about a dozen times around with a fork. 
Pile in the middle of a little flat dish be- 
fore they get cooked too hard. 

Note. The oeufs (eggs) brouilles aux 
truffles y or aux poinies d ^ aspergeSy often 
named in menus are scrambled o^gswith 
truffles and asparagus and similar acces- 
sories, the word brouille being of the 
same derivation as our broil, signifying 
a row, being in a tumult, stirred up, 

94 — Shirred Eggs. 

Some people keep little yellow ware 
dishes for this purpose, or other dishes that 
cannot be damaged by baking. Spread 
with a teaspoon a slight coating of soft 
butter over the inside of the dish, drop 
in two eggs, not beaten, and set them 



84 



SAN FRANCISGO HOTEL QAZETTE8 



inside the oven, or, perliaps, on the top 
of the range on one side. Try by shak- 
ing, and take them from the fire when 
the whites are quite cooked. Send ia 
the same dish set in a flat one. 

95— Fried Eggs. 



These are the most called-for of any 
form in which eggs are cooked and there 
is the widest possible difference between 
the work of a skilful and unskilful cook 
in this particular. The fried eggs that 
are a dis^^iace to any table are broken as 
to the yolks before they go in the pan, 
then they have black grease simmering 
up all around the edges and running 
over their surface, they are cooked near- 
ly as hard as leather, they stick to the 
pan and cannot be turned over and final- 
\y when they are forcibly pushed into a 
dish the same smoky, black grease flows 
around them like gravy. That it should 
happen so sometimes is nothing to be re- 
marked, but these lines are prompted by 
amazement that some will go on frying 
eggs that way always and habitually 
and do not se::m to know that anything 
is wrong. 

To fry the eggs cleanly and hand- 
somely, keep the small frying pans al- 
ways rubbed clean, if not bright, and 
never set them empty upon the range but 
keep them warm on the bar along the 
front of it or on a hot shelf or a row of 
bricks at the back. 



96— Poached Eggs. 

Also called dropped eggs. 

It is no trouble to poach eggs hand- 
fomely if two or three niles are ob- 
served. 

Have a roomy vessel with plenty of 
water, the frying-pan shape is good, but 
it is not deep enough. Have a little salt 
in the water. Never let the water boO 
furiously after the eejgs are in, as that 
breaks them; keep it gently simmering 
at the sides. 

The eggs break and are wasted be- 
causu wLen first dropped they go heavily 



to the hot bottom and there eticft^ to pre- 
vent which set the water in motion by 
stirring it around with a spoon. The 
eggs dropped in are carried around a 
moment and the white cooks sufliciently 
to prevent adhesion. 

Break the eggs carefully into little 
dishes and drop into the water one at a 
time. Take them out with a perforated 
ladle. 

Serve either well drained in a small 
deep dish and a speck of butter on top 
or else laid neatly on a trimmed slice of 
buttered toast. 

97'-Boiled Eggs. 

The best furnished hotel kitchens 
have a kettle much like a long fish ket- 
tle in appearance,and a number of tin has- 
kets,each wiih its handle, that fi tin side by 
side. The kettle is full of boiling water, 
and the baskets with diflerent orders of 
eggs, can be withdrawn without disturb- 
ing the others. One hand is detailed to 
attend to the e^ boiling, and he has 
sand glasses to time them by, or a clock, 
or both. At ordinary levels two or three 
minutes for soft-boiled and four or five 
for hard-boiled is the rule, but at great 
altitudes in the Rocky Mountains as 
much as eight minutes is the least time 
for hard-boiled eggs. The low point 
at which water boils is the reason for the 
difference. 



98— Fried Mush. 



Take the pan of cold mush that was 
set away over night, hold over the fire a 
minute and shake it on the table. Cat 
a quart of mush into 8 pieces. Roll 
them in cracker meal mixed with flour, 
then in milk, then in the cracker meal 
mixture again, let them lie in it to get a 
good coating. Drop into a frying pan 
half full of clear drippings made very 
hot first, and let fry light brown. 

Cost — Mush 3, breading 4, fat or lard 
4; 11 cents, or from 1 to 1^ each per- 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



85 



99— Fried Mush Egged and Breaded. 

1 quart cooked mneh. 

1 pound cracker meal. 

2eggj». 

•J pound fat to fry. 

Mix 3 tablespoonfuls milk or water 
with the egg^ and beat up. Roll the 
pieces of mush in it and then in the crack- 
er meal and fry a handsome brown in hot 
lard in a sauce pan deep enough to im- 
merse them. 



Cost of material — Neither the cracker 
meal nor the lard will be all used but an 
allowance should be made for waste or 
deterioration of what is left over. Mush 
3, eggs 4, cracker-meal 8, lard 8; 23c 
for 8 to 12 orders — say 2Jc each person. 



100— Corned-Beef Hash. 



Some of the worst blunders the half- 
made cooks commit are in making hash. 
Corned-beef hash can be made a real 
^lelicflcy, good to look at with no appear- 
ance of mystery about it, the pink meat 
fair and cleanly in the smooth and clean 
potato, and good to taste being more 
tempting to a fickle appetite than solid 
beefsteak. It is not necessarily a very 
cheap dish although it is convenient as a 
means of using a remainder of corned 
beef to make room for a fresh boiling. 
Th« attempt to make hash very cheap 
by making it the general receptacle for 
all sorts of pieces is a penny wise and 
pound-foolish proceeding, for nobody 
wants it and it is thrown away at last 
and through that and other blunders it 
has come to be at last that hash cannot 
even be given away at a free lunch. The 
writer of these lines has seen the officers 
of the finest vessels afloat send a special 
request to the kitchen for dishes of the 
deck hands' fresh made hot and savory 
comed-bcef hash for their breakfast in 
preference to all that was upon the table, 
and the passengers who had made its 
acquaintance followed up the hint and 
found out the place where hash was good. 



There is no elaborate receipt to follow 
these remarks, the necessity in the case 
is not to put things in, but to keep things 
out. Keep out the cold turnips. Keep 
out the cold mashed potatoes even,if thev 
are not uncommonly good and fresh. It 
has been shown a little way back in regard 
to the cost of potatoes, that two large 
ones are worthless than half a cent, and 
the water added when they are mashed 
cheapens them still more. Mashed tur- 
nip it still more worthless. Keep out 
the black and bard scraps and ends of 
meat, they will give a color and appear- 
ance and stale taste that will cause the 
mess to be thrown out, the good to be 
lost with the bad. Keep out the onions. 
This is the last thing that will be agreed 
to. Cooks of hotels have been known 
to quit the house rather than they would 
leave the onions out of the hash* But 
the people who live in the expensive class 
of hotels will leave the dish alone if you 
do not, and if they despise it who else is 
going to bring hash in fashion again? It 
is in the interest of true economy to 
make hash popular, because it uses up 
corned beef, which is too plentiful. To 
make **dry hash" that will be eatea^nd 
enjoyed, take: 

1 pressed-in cup minced corned beef. 

4 medium potatoes — 1 pound. 

^ a level teaspoon good black pepper. 

1 level teaspoon salt. 

1 ounce fresh butter. 

A spoonful of hot water. 

Shave oflF all discolored outside of 
meat. Chop as fine as pepper-corns or 
wheat in a wooden bowl with a chopping 
knife, add the pepper, salt and butter to 
it. Pare the potatoes raw, steam or boil 
them, put them to the meat boiling hot 
and mash together. It is not of much 
consequence whether it is to be baked or 
not but it looks better browned over and 
can be served hottest that way. Leave 
out the butter when there is plenty of fat 
to the meat. Those who study to make 
this almost forgotten dish good take care 
to com fat pieces of brisket and calves 
udder for the purpose.

Cost of material — J pound selected 
cooked meat equal to IJ pound raw9 , 
potatoes 1, butter 2; 12c a quart or 
8 family or hotel orders. 

101— Pork Brown Stew. 

1 pound coarse cut of fresh pork. 
•4 medium potatoes. 

1 tablespoonful minced onion. 

2 or three leaves green sage or a pinch 
of ground herbs. 

1 level teaspoon minced red pepper. 

2 of salt. 

1 cup fresh roast meat fat for frying. 

3 tablespoons flour. 

The fat to fry in is only used tempo- 
rarily and does not lose anything. Let 
it be especially saved from the roast meat 
pan for the brown breakfast stews, and 
have no unpleasant taste about it. Put 
it on in a small deep pauce pan to get 
hot. Cut the meat in pieces, throw two 
or three at a time into the fat when it is 
hot enough to hiss, let them get the 
sama sort of brown outside that roast 
meat has, but quickly; take out with a 
skimmer. When all the pieces are 
browned in that way, pour the fat back 
in your jar, put the pieces of meat back 
in the same saucepan, add 3 cups of wa- 
ter, the potatoes pared and cut in halves, 
and the seasoning, and stew until the po- 
tatoes are done. Mix the flour in a cup 
with water and thicken the stew with it. 



Cost of material — Pork 10, potatoes

ily portions . 

102— Wheat Muffins— Best. 



2 rounded-up cups light b»-ead dough — 
little over a pound. 

4 tablespoons meltei butter — 2 ounces. 
Same of milk or cream. 
1 teaspoon sugar. 

3 yolks of eggs — or 1 yolk and 1 egg. 
Pinch of salt. 

■J cup of flour. 

Take the piece of dough from your 
light bread or rolls that was set to rise 



over night. Two hours before breakfast 
work the butter, sugar and milk in and 
set in a warm place a few minutes. Then 
beat in eggs and flo'ir and keep beating 
against the side of the pan until the bat- 
ter is very elastic and smooth. Let rise 
in a warm place about an hour. 

The muffin rings should be two inches 
across and one inch deep. Grease them, 
set in a greased pan, half fill with the 
batter, which should be thin enough to 
settle down smooth, but thick enough 
not to run under the rings; let rise half 
an hour, bake ten minutes in a hot oven. 

103— Muffins from the Beginning. 

When there is no dough set for other 
purposes the muffins can be made from 
the beginning with: 

3 level cups flour. 

1 cup warm water and yeast mixed. 

5 tablespoons m«ilted butter. 

I teaspoon sugar. 

Same of salt. * 

3 yolks or 1 yolk and 1 egg. 

Mix up too soft to handle yet not thin 
enough to run; beat well and set in a 
warm corner to rise. Beat extremely 
well in the morning, use in muffin rings 
and bake. 



Cost of material — Flour and yeast 3, 
eggs, sugar and salt 4; 7 cents for 12 
muffins. 



104 — Buckwheat Cakes. 



2 cups buckwheat flour. 

2 cups water and yeast mixed. 

1 level teaspoon salt. 

1 tablespoon golden syrup. 

2 tablespoons melted lard. 

Make a sponge or batter over night of 
the warm water, yeast and flour. In the 
morning add the enriching ingredients; 
beat up well,and bake thin cakes on a 
griddle. 

Most people like buckwheat cakes 
with a little cornmeal mixed in the bat- 
ter. Eggs are not needed except when 
accidentally the batter ferments too much, 
when an egg will bind and make the

cakes easier to bake. Serve with but- 
ter and syrup. 

After the first mixing with yeast some 
of the batter may be saved and used in- 
stead of yeast for several succeeding 
days. A pinch of carbonate of soda 
may then be needed to be mixed in the 
batter in the morning, but cakes made 
that way, for some reason, are more pal- 
atable than with sweet yeast— care being 
taken to proportion the soda to the de- 
gree of slight sourness. 



Cost of material — Buckwheat 2, yeast 
1, syrup 1, lard 1; 5 cents for 1 quart 
batter or 24 cakes or 8 plates. To eat 
with thera, 8 ownces butter 20, J pint 
syrup 6; 28 cents total 33 cents 8 plates. 

Note. — As it is seen the cost of the 
buckwheat is next to nothing, but as the 
butter and syrap is nearly all, it is ob- 
vious that to whatever extent the lavish 



use 0^ butter can be checked, a saving 
will be effected. The alleged indigesti- 
bility of buckwheat should be laid to tlie 
common extravagance in butter and 
syrup. To such as are proof against 
dyspepsia, the poeple who lead active 
out-door lives,the fat from fried sausages 
is more relishing than butter with buck- 
wheat cakes. 

These and all other batter cakes are 
made more costly than they ought to be, 
as well as unhealthy in many places, by 
the wasteful way of ladling great spoon- 
fuls of melted lard on to the griddle to 
bake, or rather fry, the cakes in. A 
pound of lar J does not last long that way 
and it is unnecessary. Cakes can be 
baked on any sort of a griddle if it is on- 
ly rubbed md polished with a cloth every 
baking, but if greased at all a piece of 
bacon or ham rind or of suet answers 
every purpose and the cost is scarcely 
appreciable. 



Sweet Tomato Pickle. 

Seven pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled 
and sliced ; three and one half pounds 
sugar ; one ounce cinnamon and mace 
mixed ; one ounce cloves ; one quart 
of vinegar. Mix all together and 
Btew one hour. 



PIcklette. . 

• Four large crisp cabbages, cut fine ; 
one quart onions, chopped fine; two 
of vinegar, or enough to cover the 
cabbage; two pounds brown sugar, 
two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard, 
two tablespoonfuls of black pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls turmeric, two 
tablespoonsfuls celery seed, one table- 
Spoonful allspice, one tablespoonful of 



mace, one of alum, pulverized. Pack 
the cabbage and onions in alternate 
layers, with a little salt between them. 
Let them stand until next day. Then 
scald the vinegar, sugar, and spice 
together, and pour over the cabbage 
and onions. Do this three mornings 
in succession. On the fourth put all 
together over the fire and heat to a 
boil. Let them boil five minutes. 
When cold pack them in small jars. 
It is fit for use as soon as cool and 
keeps well. 

Turnovers. 

Roll out some puff-paste and cut in 

oblongshaped pieces. Put some finely 

cut cheese on the paste, turn over, 

and pinch down the edges and bake.

HOTEL DINNER. 



105— Ox Tail Soup. 

2 J quarts of soup stock. 

1 ox tail. 

1 small carrot. 

1 turnip. 

1 onion ^ 

Celery, bay leaf, cloves, salt and pep- 
per. 

Make the stock by boiling a beef shank 
in 6 quarts of water several hours, until 
it is reduced one-hal£L 

While the stock is boiling take a car- 
rot, turnip, onion and staUr of celery, 
and, with any kind of a round cutter or 
an apple-corer and knife, cut enough loz- 
enge shapes to fill a cup with the mixed 
sorts. Throw a few of the remaining 
scraps into the boiling stock for season- 
ing, and ^ a bay leaf and 8 cloves. 

Saw or chop the ox tail into thin round 
slices and steep them an hour in cold 
water. The ox tail must stew at least 
2 or 3 hours to be eatable and so far 
dissolved as to enrich the soup, and it 
may be done either in the stock boiler, 
and the pieces picked out afterward to 
go in the soup plates, or may be stewed 
in some of the stock in a separate sauce- 
pan, whichever way may be most con- 
venient. 

At last strain the specified amount of 
stock clear into the soup pot. Boil the 
shapes of vegetables in water by them- 
selves J hour, then drain off and put 
them into the soup, also the ox tail sli- 
ces. Add brown butter and flour thick- 
ening in small quantity, let the poup sim- 
mer slowly until it becomes smooth and 
clear again, and skim until all the fat is 
removed. Season with salt and cayenne. 

Serve a slice or two of the ox tail and 
some of the vegetables in each plate. 

When a soup like the foregoing has 
not a clear symp-like sort of thickness or 
body, but is dull, like flour gravy, it 
may be cleared by longer simmering and 
adding more stock with Pome cold tomato 
juice, or lemon juice or even cold water, 



and skimming from the side 

If not already light brown add a 
spoonful of burnt sugar caramel. 

Cost of material — Beef shank for stock 
10, oxtail 8, vegetables, seasonings, 
thickening 4; 22 cents for 10 half pint 
plates, or say, 2c plate or 4c pint 
bowl. 



106— Fried Bass With Bacon. 



Scale and clean the fish, chop off the 
fins, and if small cook them with- 
out cutting; if large, split them length- 
wise and cut across making four. 

Pepper and salt'the pieces, roll them 
in flour and let lie in it until the last; 
drop them into a pan of hot lard and let 
fry from five minutes upwards according 
to size. 

Fry a slice of breakfast bacon for each 
piece of fish in another pan and send in 
the bacon on the fish and a garnish of 
parsley and plain boiled potatoes. 

NoTB — There are several varieties of 
bass and for some reason hardly to be 
explained hotel stewards seem to be 
proudest of displaying striped bass in 
their best menus. The black bass is, 
however, the favorite with restaurant 
customers and it seems fair to infer that 
it has some good qualities which make it 
so. It is certainly the favorite with an- 
glers. In weight it ranges from one 
pound to five. Only from 2 to 4 ounces 
need to be served as a dinner order of 
the cooked fish, and a spoonful of potat 
toes in some form should go in on the 
same plate. For a restaurant rirder a 
fish weighing just one pound is the most 
satisfactory all around . 

Cost— ^bass 24c for 2 pounds, 8 oun- 
ces bacon 8, potatoes 8 orders 2, lard to 
fry 2; 36c for 8 dishes or 4J cents eachj 
hotel size. 

107— Boiled Be ef wit h Horseradish. 

A fat, unctuous, gristly piece of the 
brisket or "plate" is the best for this, oi

the rib ends that are sawed off a rib roast. 
Boil it slowly for at least three hours; 
have a little salt in the water (which is 
afterwards to be used to make soup.) 
Grate or finely scrape down a stick of 
horseradish, put it in a bowl with vine- 
gar and water enough to cover, and use 
it for sauce. 



Cost of material — vBeef 2 pounds 12, 
one-third — .horseradish 2, mashed 
potatoes 2; 16c for 8 dishes, 2c per dish. 

108— Roast Sucking Pig. 



The pig will be ready trussed when it 
comes from the butcher's, with the toes 
inserted in slits cut in the skin. Lay it 
on its back and drive the point of a sharp 
knife down through the bone of the back, 
dividing it convenient for carving, and 
also detach the ribs along one side, and 
loosen the inner joints of the hijw and 
legs, which can be done without spoiling 
the outside appearance of the pig. Wash 
and wipe it dry, stuff with bread dressing 
containing sage and onions, and sew up 
with twine. Roast about two hour8,cov- 
ered with a sheet of greased paper for part 
of the time, and baste with butter to get a 
fine transparent brown color on the skin 
at last. l^Iake gravy in the pan to pour 
around the pig in the dish. Serve ap- 
ple sauce separately in a sauce dish. It 
is a time honored cuntom to insert a 
small apple in the mouth of the pig be- 
fore sending it to table. 

Note — Pigs weighing from 30 to 40 
pounds are more frequently furnished to 
hotels than the very small ones, and, as 
they are not sent to table whole are con- 
sidered more satisfactory. They are too 
large to be cooked whole but are split in 
halves, carefully hacked through the 
bones inside according to the directions 
for sucking pig, and basted arid crisped 
light brown in the same manner. Serve 
with apple sauce. 



109— Apple Sauce for Meats. 

Pare good ripe apples and slice them 
into a bright saucepan. Add water 
enough to come up level with the apples 
and stew with a lid on till done — about 
thirty minutes. While they are stewing 
throw in a littlte butter. Mash at last 
with the back of a spoon. No sugar. 

Cost of material — 10 pound pig $2,00, 
stuffing 10, apple sauce 7; $2,17 — say 
for 20 to 25 orders not less than lOciper 
dish. 

Note — Pigs often cost a much larger 
amount than their weight at 20c per 
pound would be, five dollars being often 
obtained at Christmas and other holiday 
seasons. The number of dishes is some- 
what dependent upon skill in carving. 
In any case, however, this is an expen- 
sive dish. 

110— Chicken Pie, Plain. 

When chicken pie or any similar dish 
is written in a menu as of some partic- 
ular style, it, of course, carries the im- 
plication that there are more ways than 
one. A very small variation or addi- 
tion of vegetables, mushrooms or eggs 
and wine may suffice to change the 
name. It is only necessary to say here 
that one way by which young chickens, 
squirrels, rabbits etc., are partly fried in 
butter before being covered with a crust, 
and the gravy in the pan is made rich 
and light brown, may be found detailed 
elsewhere for pigeon pie, and the follow- 
ing is the other principal method, or 
country style. 

1 large fowl or 2 chickens. 

1 slice of fat salt pork — 2 ounces. 

1 large potato. 

1 teaspoonful of minced onion* 

1 of black pepper. 

1 of salt. 

1 pound of pie crust. 

2 tablespoonfuls of fiour. 
A little parsely. 

The salt pork is only a seasoning, and 
mav be dispensed with or substituted 
with butter or the fat of the fowls. 



40 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



Cut the fowl in 8 pieces if large, first 
dividing it in half through the back and 
breast, chop each side in 4, taking a 
piece out between the leg and the wing. 
Cook the gizzard and heart with the fowl, 
but leave out the liver, which is apt to 
impart its flavor to the whole dish. Boil 
the meat till tender, which may take 
anywhere from 1 hour to 4, according to 
the kind of fowl. It does not make much 
difference how old the fowl is if it be boil- 
ed accordingly with seasonings added. 
It will make the liquoi rich as jelly after 
a while. 

Half an hour before taking the fowl 
from the fire put in the potato, cut in 
pieces, and afterward thicken the liquor 
with flour and water and mix in some 
chopped parsley. 

Turn it into a baking pan, dredge a little 
more ulack pepper over the top and a lit- 
tle flour over that, aud then cover with 
plain pie paste and bake it ^ hour. 



Cost of material — Fowl 40,

111— Boiled Kale or Seakale. 



Wash free from grit, tie it in bunches, 
taim off the root end and boil it in salted, 
water, like winter spinach, about 
twenty minutes. Drain in a colander. 
Pour a spoonful of butter sauce over 
each bunch in the dish. 



112— Mashed Potatoes. 



Being such a common and easy article 
It is often the most neglected and goes 
to the table dark and full of lumps, 
when it ought to be as smooth as if 
pressed through a sieve. Butter and 
milk to mash with are good additions in 
their way, but vigorous pounding of the 
potatoes with a little salt and hot water 
or perhaps the clear fat from the top of 
the soup will nake very fine mashed po- 
tatoes when neither of those luxuries can 
be afforded. The longer the mashing 
is continued provided the potato is kept 



hot at the same time, the whiter it be- 
comes. It is an improvement, to bake 
the mashed potato in a pie pan, brushing 
the top over with milk to cause it to 
brown easily. 

113— Bread Custard Pudding. 

2 cups-pressed in-fine bread crumbs. 
2 cups milk. 

1 ounce butter — small egg size. 
1 tablespoon sugar. 

Nutmeg or grated or minced lemon 
peel. 

Crumble the bread fine either by 
chopping or grating; grate half of the 
rind of a lemon into it or a little nutmeg. 
Mix the milk with the egg and sugar; 
melt the butter and mix in and pour the 
mixture over the bread crumbs in a but- 
tered pudding-pan or bowl and bake 
about twenty-five minutes. Various 
changes can be made by adding raisins, 
currants or citron to this pudding. The 
fruit must be sprinkled in after the pud- 
ding is in the baking pan. It will sink 
if stirred. Serve a sauce with the pud- 
ding. 

Cost of material — 11 cents for one 
quart or 8 portions. With sauce 2c 
each order. 



114— Rhubarb Pie. 



Rhubarb should be peeled and cut in 
two-inch lengths, and cooked with only 
w^ter enough to cover the bottom of the 
kettle, with half a pound of brown su- 
gar to each pound spread over the top 
and the steam shut in. It burns easily, 
and should be cooked at the side of the 
range or set upon a brick, till the sugar 
dissolves with the juice to form a syrup. 

Line the pie pans with puff paste, made 
not very rich, fill with the stewed rhu- 
barb and place broad strips of paste, cut 
with a paste jagger across and bake; or 
use tbe plain pie paste and bake with a 
top crust.

115— The Stock Boiler. 



Where the best management prevails 
and the work goes on like machinery, 
one wheel within another, there is a reg- 
ular time of day to set the stock boiler 
on, it may be in the evening to simmer 
till the last, and then the liquor strained 
off is set away till the next day, or it 
may be early in the morning. The boil- 
er should be larger than the ordinary 
stove pots. Put into it a gallon of clear 
cold water. 

The meats to be cooked during the 
day are trimmed of all the tough and 
gristley ends, such as are sure to be 
thrown away if fried, broiled or roasted, 
and all the bones are taken from the 
meat that can be without detriment to 
the joint, and these scraps, after washing 
in clear water, are put into the boiler. 
Then, if there is a soup bonft beside, or 
a chicken to be boiled, or a leg of mut- 
ton it will be 80 much the richer stock. 
Some days there will be reason to choose 
which kind of soup to make, according 
to the contents of the stock boiler, which 
is a more economical way to look at it 
than if the boiler was to be furnished to 
suit the soup. A cream soup, for ex- 
ample, may be made when the stock is 
thin, and when it is rich as jelly make 
beef gravy soup or mock turtle. 

The available meat being in next, 
throw in a little vegetable seasoning, 
such as a small onion and piece of tur- 
nip and carrot. But these are not indis- 
pensible, for the soup will be seasoned af- 
terwards. 

Let the boiler heat slowly and when 
at last it boils, skim carefully two or 
three times, put the lid on and let sim- 
mer 4 or 5 hours, when there will prob- 
ably be 2 quarts of rich stock ready 
when strained, to be used in soup or to 
make gravies and sauces. 

The strainer fine enough for ordinary 



use is made of perforated tin, or a pan 
with a perforated t'u bottom. Strike 
the edge of the pan rapidly to make the 
soup go through. 

11&— Celery Cream Soup. 

3 pints soup stock. 

1 pint rich milk. 

Outside stalks of celery, about 4. 

1 small onion, minced. 

Small piece of lean cooked bam. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

Butter size of an egg. 

Salt and white pepper. 

Boil the soup stock with the onion and 
scrap of ham in it for flavor. Cut up the 
celery — about enough to fill a large cup — 
in dice shapes, and boil it ten minutes in 
water; then strain the water away. Mix 
the butter and flour together, and stir 
them into the boiling stock to thicken it 
slighty, then strain it into another sauce- 
pan and put in the parboiled celeiy and 
the pint of milk. Season with pepper 
and salt to taste. Let it simmer ten min- 
utes or more after the celery is in. 

Mince a piece of green leaf of celery 
very fine, and sprinkle it from a knife 
point into the soup. This makes six or 
seven plates. 

Butter and flour for thickening ij the 
orthodox article (roux), but should the 
butter fail to arrive punctually at the 
time the flour can be mixed with a little 
water instead. The stock used should 
have been skimmed free from fat, if not 
the soup must be. 

Cost — 21c for 2 quarts, or 3c per 
plate. 

117— Boiled Red Snapper— Shrimp 
Sauce. 



There should be a proper fish kettle 
for boiling a fish whole, having a p rfor- 
ated false bottom or drainer, that can be 
lifted out with the fish upon it when 
done. Where there is no such article 
the best substitute is a common milk pan 



42 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



of large size. Cover it with auother pan 
that the fish may get steamed if not 
quite covered. 

Choose a small fish, scale it, draw, 
chop ofl^" the fins, wash and wipe it dry on 
a cloth. 

Half fill the pan with water and put 
in a little salt, vinegar, a small onion 
and four cloves stuck in it and half a bay 
leaf. When it boils put in the fish and 
simmer it at the side of the range about 
halt an hour. Then pour off the water, 
take the skin off the upper side, slide ihe 
fish ou to its dish, if to be served whole, 
and pour over it some shrimp sauce. But 
if served individually it may be di- 
vided with a fish slice in the pan and 
sauce poured over in the plates. Small 
and tend r fish, like fresh mackerel, are 
best rolled up in a pudding cloth and 
boiled in pliin salted water, then care- 
fully unrolled onto the dish.

pan and bake a nice color on top. 

Cost of fish with sauce etc. — 2 pounds 
fish 40, seasoning 1, shrimps 15, butter 
eggs and seasonings 3, potatoes 8 por- 
tions 2 — 61 cents for 8 to 12 portions, 
or about 7c an order. 



1 pint of clear broth or water. 

Butter size of an egg. 

1 tablespoonful of flour — rather large. 

Yolk of 1 egg. 

bait and pepper. 

\ can Barataria shrimps. 

Stir the flour and most of the butter 
to&ether over the fire. When they bub- 
ble begin adding the hot broih or water, 
and stir it till cooked and thick — about 
two minutes longer. Then drop in the 
egg yolk and beat, and next the remain- 
ing small piece of butter and beat till it is 
melted. Season slightly and put in the 
shnmps. They are already cooked, 

119— Duchesse Potatoes. 



Usually served with fish, on the same 
plate. They are little cakes of mashed 
potatoes, in fancy ehapes or plain. Take 
four steamed potatoes and mash them 
with an ounce of butter, the yolk of an 
egg and salt. Spread oua pie plate, brush 
over with the yolk of an egg mixed with 
a spoonful of milk, cut in pieces of any 
ehapo, take up the pieces with a knife 



120— Larde d Fil et of Beef. 

This is nothing if not neat, uniform, 
precise and workmanlike in appearance. 
There must be a pound of fat bacon for 
larding, cold and firm, so that it can be 
cut aright. Cut the slices a quarter 
inch thick, cut these in lengths of IJ 
inches and then into strips all precisely 
alike and as thick as a common pencil. 

Procure the filet or tenderloin of beef 
with the fat on it, that is with the coat- 
ing of suet that covers the upper side of 
it, and shave that down until the cover- 
ing of fat is about as thick as a beefsteak 
all over it. Then raise the edge of the 
fat at one side, skinning the filet, so 
to speak, and lay the sheet of fat over 
on the other side without cutting it off. 
This is to have the sheet of fat attached 
ready to cover over the filet again after 
it is larded with strips of bacon. Draw 
the point of a sharp knife across and 
across the skin inside the fat, to score it 
so that it will not draw up in cooking. 
Trim off the thin end of the* filet and 
round off the thick end. C )mmence at 
the thick end with the larding. Insert 
a piece of bacon in the end of the larding 
needle and draw it through the 
top parts of the meat pinched up 
with the left thumb and finger for the 
purpose, one end of the strip of bacon bo 
inserted will be left leaning backward, 
the.ot her forward, on the surface. In- 
sert 6 or more of these strips in a row 
across. Begin the next row so that the 
strips will come alternately between 
those of the first, and the exposed ends 
will cross the others, and so continue, 
with the regularity of stitching cloth, to 
the other end. Cover the larded filet 
with the sheet of fat. Make a long and

narrow baking pan hot in the oven, with a 
tablespoonfal of salt and a cap of drip- 
pings in it, and enough water to keep the 
bottom from burning. Put in also a 
slice of turnip, carrot and onion, and a 
piece of celery. Have the oven hot, 
put in the filet, and roast it with the 
tat, covering it half an hour; then take 
off the fat, baste the filet with the con- 
tents of the pan, and let cook fifteen 
minutes longer, by which time the sur- 
face of the meat should be brown, and 
bacon strips brown too, without being 
burnt at the ends. 

Filets of beef vary in weight and 
thickness, and the time above given is 
only a guide to the average. Unless 
specially ordered otherwise, the thick 
part of the filet should cut slightly rare 
in the middle, while the thinner portion 
is well done. 

In carving, the filet should be sliced 
across vertically because it is a mass of 
strings ot meat lying side by side, and 
if cut slantingly the slices begin to be 
stringy and coarse. A filet that is to 
be braised along with herbs, spices, veg- 
etables, wine, etc., is larded with strips 
of bacon or fat pork that pass clear 
through from one side to the other diag- 
onally, so that the slices cut across when 
done, show the larding all through the 
meat. 



Cost of filet — 4 pounds $1,20, pork 
15 (not all used but culled and spoiled), 
seasonings paid for with drippings; $1.35 
for 3 pounds net, or 15 to 20 slices or 7c 
an order 



121— Mushrooms Stewed in Wine. 



Larded filet of beef with mushrooms 
or, aux champignons, is the almost uni- 
versal dish at small party dinners. The 
common method of preparing the mush- 
rooms has been described at No. 48, but 
if a finished sauce is required use half 
brown beef gravy and half mushroom 
sauce, add a bastingspoon of wine and 
simmer at the side of the range and skim 
until clear, then if not thick enough boil 



it down rapidly, and after that add the 
mushrooms, cayenne, and a spoonful of 
sherry. 

122'-Brown Gravy. 



Before serving the filet, or any roast 
meat let the gravy in the pan dry down 
until the grease can be poured off clear, 
while the glaze remains adhering to the 
pan; pour in water to dissolve it, aod 
when it has boiled add a trifle of brown 
flour thickening if it seems to need 
it; strain through a fine strainer; serve 
some in the dish with the filet, the rest 
in a sauceboat. 



123— Brown Flour for Thicl(ening. 

While butter and flour mixed in equal 
parts and baked brown makes the best 
thickening for gravies, plain browned 
flour does nearly as well and is more de- 
sirable when the butter is not very good. 
Put some sifted flour dry into a frying 
pan and bake deep brown in the oven. 
Use it at the rate of a tablespoonful to 
a cupful of liquid. Wet with water the 
same as raw flour, before stirring it in. 
It may be kept in a can always ready. 

124— Stuffed Tomatoes. 



6 or 8 lai^e tomatoes. 

X cupfol fine bread crumbs. 

1 rounded tablespoonful of minced 
onion. 

1 heaping tablespoonful minced fat 
bacon, or butter in equal amount. 

Slight grating of nutmeg. 

Cayenne and salt. 

Do not peel the tomatoes, but take a 
slice off the rough stem side and scoop 
out the inside with a tablespoon into a 
colander, so that the juice may partly 
drain away. Cut a thin slice or two of 
bread and mince across to make a cup- 
ful. Mix tiie crumbs and tomato pulp 
together, bacon, onion, very little salt, 
if any, pepper, and touch of nutmeg or 
mace. 

Fill the tomatoes with the mixture 
rounded up on top, bake in a small pan 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

well buttered, with a greased sheet of 
paper over, one-half hour. Then mois- 
ten over the tops with the back of a 
epoon dipped in butter, dredge fine 
crumbs on top and bake again without 
cover until they are well browned. 

Cost — 1 to 2 cents each according to 
season. One of the best substitutes for 
mushrooms with filet of beef. 



125— Egg Plant Plain Fried-(Sauteed.) 

Slice the egg plant, without paring, 
into five or six, throwing away only the 
end parings. Boil the slices in salted 
water a few minutes to extract the strong 
taste, drain them, and while still moist 
dip both sides in flour, then fry brown 
in a flying pan with a little drippings 
They are served as a vegetable, like 
fried parsnips, etc. 

Cost — Ic each person. 

126— Chicken Croquettes. 

1 young hen lightly roasted. 

J cup mushrooms. 

1 small cup butter. 

Same of flour. 

1 cup cream. 

Same of broth or water. 

A slight grating of nutmeg. 

A little lemon juice. 

Pepper and salt. 

Cut the meat of the roast fowl mto the 
■smallest possible dice, mince the mush- 
rooms and add, sprinkle with a teas- 
poonful of mixed pepper and salt, grate 
a little nutmeg and squeeze a lemon 
over it. 

Make cream sauce by stirring the but- 
ter and flour together in a sauce pan and 
adding the broth and cream when it be- 
gins to bubble, and when the sauce is 
ready moisten the meat with it, stir it up 
well and set it away to become cold. 
' Then make out in roUs about the size of 
a finger, roll m flour, then egg, then 
in cracker crumbs and fry m hot lard. 
Pile in the dish and garnish with fried 
jparBley. 



Cost of material — fowl 50, butter 8, 
mushrooms 10, cream 6, seasonings 2 
eggs, breading and frying 6, 82; 16 to 
20 croquettes cost 4:C to 5c each. 

>ioTE — The above is the way to make 
croquettes of the best quality, but a 
much cheaper will be found elsewhere 
described, and half the quantity can be 
made with the remains of fowl left over. 



127— Stewed Cucumbers. 

Pare three or four young and good cu- 
cumbers, and cut them in thick slices, 
boil these in water, with a little salt and 
vinegar in it — the same as for egg-plant — 
for about fifteen minutes, then pour away 
the water. Make a cupful of cream 
sauce in another saucepan, and, when 
ready, beat in the yolks of two eggs and 
a tablespoonful of vinegar. Pour this 
yellow sauce over the slices of cucumber, 
after they have been placed neatly in 
their dish. 

128— Angelica Punch. 

2 cups California angelica wine. 

2 cups hot water — a pint. 

1 cup sugar J pound. 

1 cup stemmed raisins — J pound. 

1 lemon. 

2 whites of eggs and 2 tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar to beat in. 

Chop the raisins, grate half the rind 
the lemon, squeeze in all of the juice, 
pour the hot water to them, add the su- 
gar, and stir until it is all dissolved. 
Strain the flavored syrup thus obtained 
into a freezer, and rub the most of the 
raisin pulp through as well. Add the 
wine and freeze. When nearly frozen 
whip the two whites and the powdered 
sugar together till thick, add them to 
the punch and finish freezing. It is like 
cream. Serve in stem glasses. 

Cost of material — wine 25, sugar 5, 
raisins 10, lemon 2, whites and su£ar 3, 
ice and salt 12; 57 cents for 2 quarts 
(when beaten) of punch, or 16 glasses or 
more — 3 cents a glass.

129— Boiled Young Ducks. { 

Having picked and singed them, split 
them down the back and draw them. Cut 
oflf the neck and feet. Wash them quick- 
ly in cold water and wipe dry, and flat- 
ten them slightly to broiling shape with 
a tap of the cleaver. Lay the duck on 
a plate, dredge with salt and pepper and 
brush over both Fides with butter. Broil 
on the gridiron over clear coals, the in- 
side first, about 15 minutes. Serve on 
a hot dish, with a border of small pieces 
of toast or green peas with currant jelly 
or a quartered lemon, or with the foUow- 
sauce. 

130 Orange Sauce For Meats. 

1 orange. 

1 cupful of brown sauce. 

^ cupful of claret. 

A little cayenne. 

Shave oflF very thinly the yellow rind 
of about a quarter ef the orange and 
boil it in the brown sauce about 10 min- 
utes. Gut half the orange into small 
slices and remove the pith and seeds. 

Strain the brown sauce from the peel, 
throw into it the orange slices, squeeze 
in the juice of the remaining half, add 
the claret and cayenne, let it boil up and 
skim off the film that will rise. 

K there is no brown sauce on hand 
soup stock can be used and thickened 
with a ppoonful oi flour worked in a 
small piece of soft butter. Pour the 
sauce under the ducks in the dish and 
dispose the pieces of orange around them. 



Cost. — 4 young ducks, $1 ; 1 can

131— Crab Salad. 

6 boiled crabs, common size. 

1 cup finely minced white cabbage. 

■8^ cup salad dressing. 

Pick the meat out of the crabs, cut 
all that can be cut into pieces of even 
size and rub the rest smootli in salad 
dressing, adding a little mustard . Mix 



Cost. — 6 crabs, 30; dressing, 4; 34 
cents for 8 orders. 



132 Apple Turnovers. 

Sometimes served as a ** sweet en- 
tree; " more suitable to put in place of 
pie; best for luncheon, pic-nic parties, 
and for sale; a favorite form of pastry 
everywhere. 

Make the flaky pie paste with about 
12 ounces of butter to a pound of flour, 
roll it out to a thin sheet and cut out 
flats nearly as large as saucers, with the 
lid of a baking powder can or similar 
cutter. 

Place a good spoonful of dry stewed 
apple in the middle of each piece of paste 
and double over in half-moon shape. 
Press the two edges together and crimp 
them with the thumb and finger. When 
the baking pan is full of the turnovers, 
brush them over with egg-and-water, 
and dredge granulated sugar on top. 
Bake slowly till they are crisp, glazed 
and of a fine reddish brown color. These 
large sizes have generally to be cut in 
two. They contain more fruit and are 
better eating when made small. 



Cost op Mateeial. — Four turnovers 
— crust 4, apple marmalade, 2, e^^ and 
sugar glaze, 2; 8 c. or 1 cent each order. 



133— Puff Paste. 

1 pound of cold flour. 

15 ounces of cold butter. 

1 cupftil of ice water. 

Gei quite ready to make the paste be- 
fore you begin, that it may be done 
quickly. It will not, perhaps, belightand 
good if allowed to stand long in a warm 
room. Leave out a handful of fiour to 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

dust with. Make a hollow in the mid- 
dle of the rest in a pan, ponr in the ice- 
water and mix up gradually with the 
fingers. Turn the paste on the table 
double and press a little to make it, 
smooth. Roll it out to half an inch 
thickness, pound the butter with a potato 
masher to make it pliable, drop half of 
it in lumps all over the sheet of paste, 
flif t a veiy little flour over, press down the 
lumps of butter, fold over in three and 
turn the broad side toward you. Roll 
out agam, drop the rest of the butter as 
before, fold in three and count that one. 
Roll out evenly with plenty of flour to 
prevent sticking, fold over in three and 
count that two. Do the same four times 
more, making six folds (beside the first 
one not counted) and it is ready for use, 
but should be allowed to stand aw;]iile 
in the refrigerator to lose the tendency 
it has when first made to draw up out of 
shape. • 

If you have a good refrigerator at 
hand the puff paste will be the better for 
being set in it after the thkd folding and 
allowed to remain ^ hour and then taken 
out and finished rolling, but, it not, the 
only way to have the paste good is to 
start with cold material and make it and 
bake it so quickly that it has not time to 
warm and melt in the meantime. 



Cost of material — butter 23, flour 3; 
26 cents for 2J pounds. Makes 5 pies 
with single bottom crusts, or 3 covered — 
depending upon the size or 20 turnovers 
or 20 to 25 tarts in patty pans, or 10 to 
16 tartlets like the following. 

Note — Lard of a solid, firm sort will 
make puff paste that is quite as good 
as that made with butter, and that rises 
nearly as high in the baking; and the 
cost is reduced according to the differ- 
ence in price per pound. But soft lard 
cannot be used for this purpose. The 
best common flaky paste is made with 
half lard and half butler, with salt 
sprinkled over the lard, the butter put 
into the dough first, and the whole of 
the ingredients kept as cold as possible. 



134— Cherry Tartlets. 

1 heaping cup ripe cherries. 

1 level cup light brown sugar. 
lJ^X)unds puff paste. 

Set the cherries on to cook in a smalt 
saucepan with a bastingspoon of water, 
and sugar spread over the top. Put on 
the lid and let simmer slowly then set 
them away to become cold. The fruit 
for this purpose should be rich with a 
thick strong syrup, because only a small 
quantity is used and it should not run 
out of the tartlets. 

Roll the puff paste to ^ inch thick, cut 
out with a biscuit cutter, and cut the 
middle of each part way through with a 
smaller cutter. Put them in a hot oven 
and when they are risen open the door 
partly and let them dry well done. Take 
out the middle piece with a knife point 
and fill the tarttets with the stewed fruit. 

Cost — about 2c each, or according to 
whether fresh or cannnd frut is used and 
the price. 

135— Tipsy Pudding. 

Sheets of sponge cake partly saturated 
with rum and set in a pan of cold boiled 
custard, For the cake make this: 

•J cupful of sugar 4 ounces. 

2 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of water. 

1 cup of flour — 4 ounces. 

1 teaspoonful baking powder. 

Separate the eggs— the whites in a 
bowl or dish, the yolks in the mixing 
pan. Put the sugar and water in with 
the yolks, and beat them till they are a 
thick yellow froth. Mix the powder in 
the flour, add that and stir up well. 
Whip the whites firm, add them last. 

Grease and flour 2 jelly cake pans, di- 
vide the mixture into them and bake of 
a very light color. When done place 
the sheets of cake one on the other in a 
pan and pour ^ cup of rum or brandy 
into them with a teaspoon. Have ready 
2 cups of custard and pour around. Cut 
in 8 and serve like pudding and sauce.

eggs 4, powder 1, rum 12, custard 9, 
29c, for 8 dishes 3 or 4 cents an order. 

136— Boiled Custard. 



2 cups milk. 

2 eggs. 

2 heaping tablespoons sugar. 

Flavoring of nutmeg or stick cinna- 
mon. Boil the milk with half the sugar 
in it to prevent burning on the bottom. 
Beat the two eggs in a cup with the rest 
of the sugar and a spoonful of milk 
added. When the milk boils pour a 
little to the eggs, then turn all into the 
saucepan and stir until it thickens and 
shows signs of boiling. Too much cook- 
ing will spoil it. 

137— Caramel Ice Cream. 



3 cups rich milk. 

1 cup cream. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

2 tablespoons sugar forcaramel 
8 tablespoons sugar to sweeten 
J cupcuracoa. 

Set the 2 ounces of sugar over the fire 
in a little saucepan, without water, and 
let it melt and brown to the color of ma- 
ple syrup, then add to it a few spoons- 
tuls of water and set it at the side to 
dissolve and make liquid caramel. 

Boil the 3 cups of milk with half the 
sugar in it, beat the yolks with the rept 
of the sugar and a spoonful of milk added, 
pour them and the milk together and 
cook a minute carefully to make smooth 
yellow custard. Add the caramel to it 
and strain it into the freezer, pour in the 
curacoa when cold and whip the cup of 
cream and add that and freeze with 
rapid beating. 

Cost of material — milk and cream 10, 
eggs 8, sugar 7, curacoa 20, ice and 
salt 10, 55 cents for about 2 quarts af- 
ter freezing. 

138— Clams on the Half Shell. 



The smallest clams are preferred. 
Wash the outride thoroughly before 



opening. Loosen the clams from shell 
they are served in and retain all the 
liquor the shell will hold. Place 4 or 5 
in each plate and half a lemon in the 
middle. 



Cost — depends on locality. The fur- 
ther from the sea shore the more of a 
variety to serve at a fine diner. 



139— Consomme Royal. 

We have no word in English for ron- 
somme but broth, and that is not an 
equivalentjbut only a substitute. French 
cooks understand by consomme a clear 
soup as rich as melted jelly. Consomme 
royal is of the color of brandy, with little 
egg custards floating ic it. 

•Simmer a large fowl and two or 
more shanks of veal in a gallon )f water 
for three or four hours, and while it is 
cooking add the vegetables and seiason- 
ings. These should be the usual soup 
bunch (without parsnips or green onion 
tops, however), together with a stalk of 
celery, half a bay leaf, a teaspoonful of 
bruised pepper-coras and a sprig of 
green thyme or marjoram. 

When it has boiled long enough strain 
the broth into a saucepan. 

To clarify the consomme,chop a pound 
of lean beef fine, mix with it two whites 
of eggs and a cup of cold water. Then 
pour the broth to the be^f, stir up and 
boil again. Strain through a napkin or 
jelly bag, season with salt, color with a 
teaspoonful of dissolved burnt sugar and 
remove every particle of grease. 

To make the floating custards take three 
or four yolks of eggs, raw, and mix 
with them a spoonful of the consomme. 
Poui- into a slightly buttered saucer and 
steam it until done — 10 minutes. Cut 
the custard in diamond shapes and drop 
three or tour in each soup plate. 



Where it is not necessary to be ex- 
tremely particular good clear soup can 
be obtained by letting the soup-stock get 
cold in a jar and after taking off the fat, 
pouring it off without disturbing the

eediment. Strain through a napkin, 
make hot and add the spoonful of coloring 
and Bait as before. 

Cost of material — chicken to be used 
in salad or patties 0, veal 16, vegetables 
5, beef 10, eggs, 6; 37c for 2 quarts, 
or 3c per plate. 

140— Vegetable Soup. 



2 quarts of soup stock — 8 or 10 cups. 

3 cups mixed vegetables. 
Seasonings. 

Take for the stock the liquor in which 
any kind of meat has been boiled — be e 
shank, mutton, heart, tongue, fowl, rab 
bit, etc., and corned beef liquor does 
very well. The richer the stock can be, 
of course the better it is. Strain it into 
the soup pot. Skim off most of the fat 
almost every kind of vegetable can be 
used. Take a piece of each andc ut al 
into dice shapes, or, if to be very nice, 
cut vegetables in slices and stamp out 
little patterns with a tin cutter or the 
point of a tin funnel. There should be 
turnips white and yellow, carrot, pump- 
kin, celery, siring beans, green peas, 
onions, summer squash, cauliflower. If 
vegetables are scarce, a little parsnip 
and cabbage and potatoes can be used, 
but the latter put in late so as not to boil 
away. 

Boil the hard vegetables, such as car- 
rots, turnips, onions, string beans and 
celery, together in a little saucepan first; 
then pour the water away and put the 
vegetables in the boiling stock, and add 
the easy-cooking kinds, such as cauli- 
flower, asparagus heads and peas — 
whatever may be on hand. At last add 
apiece of red tomato, cut small, salt and 
pepper to taste and a tablespoonful of 
com Btarchjnixed in a cup with water. 



Cost — about 10c per quart or 8 plates 
141— Baked Sea Bass. 



Scale and clean the fish; leave the 
bead on if it ii to be sent to table whole. 
Make a stuffing for it of 2 pressed cupfuls 
of bread crumbs, a email cupful of but- ( three hours. 



ter, rind of a quarter of lemon minced 
fine, parsely, green thyme and marjoram, 
and pepper and salt, and two eggs 
mixed with a spoonful of water to mois- 
ten it. Sew up the fish when stuffed, 
lilark it in slices as if to be carved, on 
both sides, by cutting down to the bone, 
and put a thin slice of salt pork in each 
incision. Bake in a long pan, with soup 
stock and salt and pepper in it, 
about 30 or 40 minutes, or according to 
size. Put a little strained tomatoes and 
brown gravy into the fish pan, and water 
if necessary; let boil up, skim and strain 
for sauce. 



Cost of material — 3 lbs fish 36, pork 
slices for insertion and sci-aps in baking 
pan 6, stuffing and sauce 15; 57c for 8 
to 12 orders or 5 or 6c per plate. 

142— Small Potatoes. 



Scoop out balls size of cherries from 
large potatoes with a potato spoon. A 
cupful will make enough for a dozen 
plates of fish. ;A[ake J cup of butter 
and -J cup of lard hot in a very small 
saucepan and drop the potato balk in and 
let them stew slowly. As soon as the 
butter gets down to the frying point and 
the potatoes and sediment begin to 
brown on the bottom pour off all the 
grease and set the potatoes in the oven 
a few minutes to acquire a handsome 
color. Sprinkle salt and chopped pars- 
ley among them. Serve a tablespoon- 
ful with each plate of fish. These are 
not the same as fried potatoes and when 
first put into the boiling butter and lard 
they must be stirred from the bottom 
once or twice lest they scorch and ac- 
quire a bad taste. 

143— Boiled 



Corned Tongue,

Fresh tongues put in a jar and cover- 
ed with the brine or pickel No. 106, will

and pelt off the skin then set in a hot 
place. In carving cut slantingly to 
make long slices that will not ran out 
too small at the thin end . Serve with 
caper sauce, which is butter sauce with 
a little of the caper vinegar mixed in and 
the capers — about a teaspoonful— dashed 
on top of the sauce on the meat. 

Cost of material — tongue 35, sauce 
5; 40c for 8 to 12 orders or 4c per plate. 

144— Roast Rib Ends of Beef. 



Take the ends of the ribs that are. 
eawed off the rib roasts, and put them in 
to cook early, while brealrfast is still 
going on. Let there be in the baking 
pan, which should be a deep one, a hand- 
ful of salt, 2 or 3 ladlefuls of sweet 
fresh drippings from the previous day's 
roasting, and about as much water or 
Boup stock, and let simmer in the oven, 
never getting quite without water in the 
pan till very nearly time to serve dinner. 
K other meats have to be crowded into 
the same pan let these rib ends be at 
the bottom, they will be so much the 
richer and keep on cooking in the gravy 
till tender and glutinous. At last, the 
water being all evaporated out of the pan, 
roll these rib ends over and over in the 
natural glaze that remains on the bottom 
and take them out brown and shining 
before they likewise get dry. Serve 
cuts of 2 or 3 ribs with gravy. 

Cost of material — 3 lbs beef rib ends 
18, seasonings and gravy 2; 20c for 8 or 
10 orders. 



145— The Side of Lamb. 



The dainty dish of spring lamb may 
easily be spoiled, or at least made 
very unsatisfactory by careless cutting. 
K you take off the shoulder it will 
scarcely make two good orders when 
roasted, and the ribs underneath it will 
amount to nothing. Nearly all who 
choose their cuts ask for the ribs and tlie 
carver needs all that the cook can fur- 
nish. 



Instead of taking the shoulder off,bone 
it where it is, beginning at the throat. 
Cut along on both sides of the blade 
bone and pull it out. There will not be 
much time for careful boning, nor is it 
necessary, five minutes or less will do. 
Saw the ribs across the middle, hack 
through the back bone with the point of 
a sharp cleaver at two ribs apart and 
hack the brisket through ready for carv- 
ing in the same manner. Then pull the 
meat of the shoulder well over the bris- 
ket and fasten it with a skewer or two. 
When carved, the ribs will carry a good, 
meaty slice of the shoulder with them, 
and with a little management the brisked 
en Is of the ribs can be equally well por- 
tioned off. 

The side thus prepared should be 
roasted in one piece, loin and flank in- 
cluded, but the leg requiring more time 
to cook, should be made a separate cut. 
The loin should likewise be careftdly 
hacked through the back bone ready for 
carving into slices like loin chops. 

146~Roast Lamb—Mint Sauce. 



It cooks in from 30 to 45 minutes. 
Should be fairly done through and no 
more. Needs to be in a pan by itself. 

Having prepared the meat as directed 
above, wash it in cold water, dredge 
both sides with salt and flour, by pres- 
sing both sides down into a pan of 
flour and shake off the surplus. Place it 
with the outside upwards in a baking 
pan already hot and containing a little 
saltwaterand drippings. Whentheupper 
side has cooked so that the flour will 
not wash off begin to baste it and 
repeat frequently. If a quarter pound 
of quite fresh butter can be had melt it 
and baste the lamb with it at the finish. 
The butter froths upon meat and gives 
it a fine color. 

Cost of material — fore-quarter of lamb, 
or 4 lbs, 60, mint sauce 5; 65c for 12 
dishes or 5 or 6c per order. 



147— ^Mint Sauce for Roast Lamb.

the sugar and a inegar in a bowl. Serve 
cold, a spoonful to each plate. 



148— Roast Green Goose. 



Singe and pick the young goose free 
from pin-feathers and draw it. If to send 
the table whole, the pinions should be 
cut oflF before cooking and the main wing 
joints skewered to the back, and the 
legs held compactly to the side either 
with skewers or twine. Fry a minced 
onion in butter, light yellow, and not 
at all dark and strong, and mix it 
with some dry mashed potatoes; add 
an e^^ and the butter that the onion 
was fried in and a seasoning of white 
pepper. Stuff the goose with the sea- 
soned potato, sew up, bake it in a pan 
for about one hour, or more, if large. 
Dredge the goose over with flour when 
nearly done, and baste it with butter, 
which will pmduce a fine crust and 
brown color. ' 

If to be sent in whole, bake some 
small apples in a pan covered with 
greased paper and place them around 
the goose in a dish. 

Cost of material — the same as spring 
lamb, about 6 or 7c an order, according 
to market price. 

149— Cucumber Salad. 

Slice the cucumbers two hours before 
they are wanted and sprinkle the slices 
plentifully with salt. Set the dish in the 
refrigerator. Just before dinner drain 
away the salt liquor from the cucum- 
bers and shake them about with oil first, 
and then with vinegar and pepper. Serve 
on a very cold dish. 

150-Turkey Salad. 

Take the remamder of a cooked tur- 
key or half a boiled turkey, if cooked 
for the purpose, pick all the meat from 



the bones and remove the thick fat and 
skin, cut the meat into long shreds and 
then across, making the smallest, pos- 
sible dice shapes. Cut celery, if in sea- 
son, the same way, about two-thirds as 
much celery as there is turkey, or if 
that is not in season use crisp lettuce or 
a mixture of lettuce and finely chop* 
ped white cabbage, and add celery salt 
or extract or celery vinegar. Mix meat 
and the vegetables together, season 
slightly with Depper and salt. Pour in 
a little salad oil — say a quarter cupful, 
stir about and then stir in as much vin- 
egar. Heap and smooth over the salad 
in a large platter — it will adhere and 
keep shape well — then pour and spread 
over it a well-seasoned mayonaise. 

After spreading the mayonaise over 
the turkey salad, ornament with quar- 
ters of hard boiled eggs or with chop- 
ped yolks and parsley, olives, cut lem- 
ons or shapes stamped out of cooked 
beets. 



Cost of material — 2 lbs turkey meat 
or chicken 40, oil, vinegar and season- 
ings 10, celery and garnishings 10, may- 
onaise 15; 75c for 2 quarts, or from 8 
to 16 orders; or, 40c per quart or 5c 
per hotel dinner dish. 

151— Mayonaise Salad Dressing. 

2 raw yolks of eggs . 

^ teacup olive oil. 

About half as much vinegar or lemon 
juice. 

A level teaspoon salt. 

Same of made mustard. 

Pinch of cayenne. 

Put the two raw yolks in a pint bowl, 
add two tablespoonfuls of oil, set the 
bowl in ice-water or otherwise make it 
cold, and beat with a Dover egg-beater 
about a half a minute. Then add more 
oil and whip, and then throw in the salt, 
and on whipping again the mixture will 
at once thicken up, looking like softened 
butter. Then add a spoonful of vinegar, 
then oil and so on alternately till all is 
in. Add the mustard and cayenne for 
seasoning. The best mayonaise is

made with lemon juice instead of part 
of the vinegar, and when it will not 
thicken as desired the lemon juice inva- 
riably corrects the trouble and gives the 
dressing the desired consistency. It 
should not be thin enough to run, but 
should coat over the pile of salad mate- 
rial it is spread upon. The foregoing 
shows the quickest method of making 
this important sauce or dressing; the 
egg-beater or the want of it need not, 
however, be an obstacle in the way, for 
simply stirring around in the bowl with 
a wooden spoon is the way most com- 
monly p'-acticed. 

152— Water Cress Salad. 

Cut away the rough stems, pick off 
the root fibers, and wash the cress care- 
fully. Drain, cut it in inch lengths, 
Beason in a bowl with a little salt and 
pepper, and when they are mixed in 
sprinkle with vinegar. Serve in small 
salad dishes individually, 

153— Lambs' Tongues with Artichokes. 

Take for preference, corned lambs* or 
sheeps* tongues of a good pink color, and 
boil them not less than 2 hours, which 
may be done the evening before they 
are served, if more convenient. Put 
them into cold water and peel off the 
outside and split them lengthwise in two. 

Having the halves ready in a dish 
when the roast meat is done, after taking 
it out lay the tongues in the fat and 
glaze in the baking pun for about 5 min- 
utes,then take them out slightly browned 
and glazed and keep hot. 

Cook an artichoke for each dish, as 
directed further on, boiling them, that is 
to say, like summer cabbage or cauli- 
flower, but cut them in halves instead 
of quarters; only scoop out the fibrous 
part before cooking. Drain them well. 
Serve half a tongue in the small dish 
and a half artichoke at each end, and a 
Bpoonful of brown gravy over the vege- 
table without covering the tongue. 
Tongue and spinach may be served the 
same way. 

Cost of material — 4 tongues 20, arti- 



chokes and gravy 10; 30c for 8 dishes or 
about 4 cents per order. 

154— Spaghetti and Cheese— Romaine. 

Spaghetti is maccoroni in another form, 
a solid cord instead of a tube. 

4 ounces spaghetti — 2 cups when 
broken . 

1 cup minced cheese — 2 ounces. 

1 cup milk. 

Butter size of an q^^, 

2 yolks of eggs . 

This dish ought to t)e quite yellow. 
Throw the spaghetti into water that is 
already boiling, and salted. After cook- 
ing 20 minutes drain it dry, and put it 
into the buttered dish it is to be baked 
in. 

Put the cheese and butter and half 
the milk into a saucepan and stir them 
over the fire till the cheese is nearly 
melted, mix the yolks with the rest of 
the milk, pour that into the saucepan, 
then add the whole to the spaghetti in 
the pan, and bake it a yellow brown in 
as short i time as possible. It loses its 
richness if cooked too long, through the 
toughening of the cheese. 

Cost of material — spaghetti 4, cheese 
3, milk 1, butter 3, egg-yolks 3; 14c 
for 8 orders, or about 2c per dish. 

155— Vanilla Puff fritters — Rum 
Sauce. 

1 cup water— ^ pint. 

^ cup butter- -3 ^ ounces. 

2 rounded tablespoons sugar. 

I rounded cup flour^S ounces. 

3 large eggs. 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Boil the water with the sugar and 
butter in it in a deep saucepan. Drop 
in the flour all at once and stir the mix- 
ture over the fire till you have a firm, 
well-cooked paste. Take it from the 
fire and work in the egg« one at a time 
with a spoon, and beat the paste well 
against the side of the sancepan. Add 
the vanilla with the last egg. The more 
the paste is beaten the more the pu£b 
will expand in the frying fat.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETJE'S 



Make some lard hot. It will take 
half a saucepauful. Drop pieces of the 
batter about as large as eggs and watch 
them swell and expand in the hot lard 
and become hollow and light. Only four 
or five at a time can be fried because 
they need lots of room. 

The fritters being slightly sweet will 
be liable to fry too dark if the lard be 
made too hot; and they may be as much 
as five minutes in it before they begin to 
swell and roll over. 



Cost of material — butter 8, sugar 
and vanilla 2, flour 1, eggs 6, lard to 
fry damaged 4 21c for 12 fritters — rum 
sauce 11 — 32 cents for 12 dishes of frit- 
ters with rum sauce or about 3c per 
order. 



156— Rum Sauce for Fritters. 

1 cup water. 

i cup sugar. 

1 rounded tablespoon starch. 

^ a lemon — without the seeds. 

1 ounce butter. 

1 bastingspoon of rum. 

Boil the water. Mix the starch with 
the sugar dry and stir them in. Slice 
the lemon into it and add the butter and 
let the sauce simmer at the side until it 
becomes quite transparent. Then add 
the rum. Pour a spoonful over each 
fritter as they are dished up. 

Cost — 11 or 12 cents. 

1 57— B rowned Potatoes. 



Pare the potatoes and steam them, and 
the broken ones being used to mash, or 
a la duchesse, put the others in a small 
pan with some of the drippings from the 
roast lamb pan and a dredf ing of salt 
and bake them brown. Cold boiled or 
baked potatoea are not fit for this pur- 
pose — they can be used better for break- 
fast dishes. 



158— Cauli flower in Cream. 

Cauliflower takes from half to three- 
quarters of an hour to cook done. It 
should not boil rapidly enough to de- 



stroy the small flowerets. Try the stems 
with a fork and take off when tender. A 
lump of baking soda the size of a 
bean in the water will hasten the cook- 
ing without injuring the vegetable. 

Divide the cauliflower into portions of 
convenient size before cooking, and 
when drained and dished up pour a 
spoonful or two of good strained cream 
sauce over each portion. 



159— Stewe d But ter Bean^. 

Throw Lima or butter beans into a 
sauce-pan of water that is already boil- 
ing and has salt in it, and cook about 
half-hour, if green beans, but if dried 
they will take one and a half hours, be- 
sides a previous soaking in water. Drain 
away tho water, and mix a little cream 
sauce or butter sauce, or add milk, but- 
ter and salt, and thicken when it boils 
up. 

160— Artichok es as a Vegetable. 

Let ihe artichokes lie in a pan of cold 
water,the same as is the rule for cauliflow- 
er,spinach,etc., an hour or two before they 
are to be cooked. Wash well, and if 
the tips of the leaves are discolored, 
clip them; cut the artichokes in 4 and 
remove the stringy core. Have the water 
ready boiling, put in a teaspoonful of 
salt and baking soda the size of a bean, 
boil the artichokes about J hour or until 
the soft end of the leaf when ^julled out 
proves to be tender. Drain and serve 
like cauliflower, 2 pieces in a dish, and 
a spoonful of butter sauce poured over. 

161— Indian Fruit Pudding. 

3 cups milk or water — 1 J pints. 
1 cup yellow corn-meal — 6 ounces.

in for an hour or two. Then mix in all 
the other ingredients, the fruit previously 
dusted with flour, and bake it in a pan 
or mold about an hour. Cover with 
greased paper to keep the fruit from 
blistering. Three heaping cups of com- 
meal mush ready made will do as well. 
The above makes a quart of pudding.

162— Rich Lemon Pie. 



7 ounces sugar — a cupful. 

3 lemons. 

1 cup rich cream. 

6 yolks of eggs and 2 whites. 

Place the sugar in a bowl and grate 
the lemon rinds into it with a tin greater, 
and then squeeze in the juice. Beat the 
yolks of eggs light and mix the cream 
with them; pour this to the lemon and 
sugar, and just before filling the pie 
crusts with the mixture whip the two 
whites to a froth and stir them in. 

Use puff-paste to line the pie pans. 
The mixture will fill two pies, or three if 
small. It is hard to bake without brown- 
ing the top too much, so they should be 
under the shelf of the oven. These rich 
pies do not need frosting,only a dredging 
of powdered sugar. 

Cost of material — sugar 5, lemons 6, 
cream 6, eggs 12, paste 6; 35c for 10 
portions, or 3 or 4 cents each order. 



163— White Cocoanut Pie. 



1 cup milk. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 

1 rounded tablespoon starch. 

2 or 3 ounces grated cocoanut. 

3 or 4 whites of eggs. 
Small piece of butter. 
Pinch of salt. 

Boil the milk alone. Mix the starch 
and sugar together dry and stir them in; 
then the butter and cocoanut. Set it 



away to get cold. Whip the whites to 
a firm froth and mix them with the pie- 
mixture. Bake in thin crusts of puff 
paste. Makes two small pies. 

Cost of material — milk 2, sugar and 
starch 2, cocoanut 5, butter 1, eggs 4, 
crusts for 2 pies 5; 19 cents for 8 por- 
tiaos, or 2 to 3c per order.

1 cupful of sugar — 8 ounce^. 

2 cupfuls of water. 

The kernels of half the apricots. 

2 whites of eggs. 

The ripest and sweetest apricots, if the 
fresh fruit be used, should be kept out, 
one cupful to be mixed in the ice when 
finished. 

Stew the other two cupfuls and the 
peeled kernels in the water and sugar for 
a few minutes, rub the fruit then with 
the back of a spoon, through a strainer 
into the freezer along with the syrup. 
Freeze like ice cream and when it is 
nearly finished whip the two whites to a 
firm froth, mix them in and turn the 
freezer rapidly a short time longer. Stir 
in the cut apricots just before serving. 
Canned apricots can be used as well, and 
if in syrup that can be mixed in also. 

Cost of material — apricots 25, sugar 
5, white of eggs 4, ice and salt 10; 44c 
for 3 pints or 8 to 12 dishes, or 4c per 
order.

Whip the whites to a firm froth and mix 
them and the prepared flour in a portion 
of each alternately. Flavor. Bake as 
soon as mixed ; either in layers for choc- 
olate cake or in mold. If the latter, frost 
over when cold. 

Cost — 50 cents for a 2 quart mold or 
about 3 lbs of cake; with icing 5c more. 

166— Tomato Soup. 



2 quarts soup stock. 

1 cupful stewed tomatoes* 

1 small cupful of minced vegetables. 

6 cloves. 

1 tablespoon minced parsley. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Little flour for thickening. 

Tomatoes stewed down after season- 
ing with salt, pepper and butter, are a 
different article from the freshly pre- 
pared and impart a new richness to soup. 

The soup stock may be the liquor in 
which a piece of beef or mutton is boiled 
for dinner, with the addition of other raw 
scraps and pieces, such as the bones and 
gristly ends of a beefsteak. An hour 
before dinner time take out the meat 
strain the stock through a fine strainer 
and into the soup pot. Cut piece of car- 
rot, turnip and onion into small dice 
and throw in and let cook till done and 
add the cloves and cup of tomatoes, 
pepper and salt, thickening and the pars- 
ley at 1st. 

It is generally considered a reproach 
to say the soup is thin. A proper mtdi- 
um should be observed. A spoonful of 
flour gives the smoothness and substance 
required without destroying the clear- 
ness of the soup. 



Colt of material — stock 4, tomatoes 
6, vegetables and seasonings 2; 12c for 
12 plates. 

167— Middle Cut of Salmon— Boiled. 

Take about three pounds of the mid- 
dle out of a small salmon, and, havmg 
scaled and cleaned it, put it on to cook 
in water that is already boiling and 
strongly salted. The fish should be 
placed on the drainer or false bottom of 
the fish kettle, but where there is no 
such utensil the precaution should be 
taken to wrap and pin it in a buttered 
napkin, that it may come out of the 
water unbroken. Let it cook . very 
gently at the side of the range for three- 
quarters of an hour. Take it up, re- 
move the skin, and place it carefully on 
a hot dish. At the moment that it is 
sent to table pour over it some of the 
fresh butter sauce of the next recipe, fill 
the remaining space around it in the dish 
with a pint of potato bouUeites, and 
send in some more of the sauce in a 
sauce-boat. 

168— Scotch Fish Sauce. 



Set 8 ounces of the best butter, the 
juice of one lemon, a pinch of cayenne 
and a tablesoonful of chopped parsley in 
a bowl in a place warm enough to soften 
the butter, but not to melt it, and when 
the sauce is wanted tor use stir together 
until creamy. 

Cost of material — salmon 1,00, pota- 
toes 2, sauce 20; $1,22 for 12 hotel 
orders or 10c per plate. 

169 — Boiled Bacon and Cabbage. 

(Jut 2 summer cabbages in quarters 
and cut out most of the stem part. Let 
lie in a pan of cold water until wanted 
to cook. Put on sauc ^pan plenty large 
enough with water and salt and a very 
little baking soda in it — about the size 
of a bean for two cabbages — when it 
boils put in the cabbage and let it cook 
half an hour.

of bacon and boil the bacon in a sauce- 
pan by itself for half hour. Then drain 
off both cabbage and bacon and put them 
both together in one pot, pour in boiling 
water just to cover, put on a good-fitting 
lid and let them slowly cook together 
half hour longer. 

The quarters ot cabbage, nice and 
green appearing, should be drained in 
the spoon as they are taken up without 
destroying their shape, and placed in the 
dish with the bacon sliced on top.

170—Roa8t '6eef. 



To roast or bake meat so that, how- 
ever small the piece may be, it will 
be found full of gravy when cut, 
it is necessary to have the pan it is baked 
in hot before the meat goes in, and al- 
though there must be liquor in the pan 
while it is baking, that should be added 
after the meat has become hot enough 
outside for the pores to be closed and 
juices retained inside. 

The choice roasting piece of beef is the 
ribs between the edge of the shoulder- 
blade and the loin — the short ribs. As 
the butchers have to sell everything, as 
a matter of business, they take out the 
ri )s and coil the thin meat of the breast 
around the choice upper portion, and 
make a neat cushion-shaped roast, se- 
cured with twine and skewers. In the 
places where the highest prices are paid, 
however, the breast portion has to be c it 
away altogether and cooked separately, 
as in our example of last week, and the 
choice upper portion or enire-cote only is 
roasted. This is nearly always cooked 
rare done, and the plentiful graTy that 
flows from it when cut is caught in a dish 
and is the only gravy served with it. As 
to time, the old rule is the only ono. 
Allow a quarter of an hour for each 
pound of meat, and less, according to 
judgment, when the roast is of thin shape 
or required to be very rare done.

171— Stuffed Brisket of Veal. 



The breast or brisket of veal is a low- 
priced cut, at least when the veal is 
large, but is most excellmt when cooked 
tender. There is a large proportion of 
gelatinous bone and tendon good for 
soups and stews. Take the entire 
"plate," as the butchers call it, and 
take out the bones by cutting down the 
sides of the ribs and along the brisket 
edge with the point of the knife, without 
cutting down through. Then chop the 
bone in pieces and use them in soup, a* 
directed in a previous receipe. Make 
the bread stuffing the same as for roast 
turkey, lay it on the broad , boneless 
piece of veal — which may be made 
broader and evener by splitting the 
breast edge part way — then roll up and 
tie in good shape with twine. Put the

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZEUES 



rolled veal into a baking pan, with fat 
skimmed from the soup, a little water 
and salt and baked with greased paper 
on top for a time, according to the size 
of the veal — probably an hour and a 
half. Baste it with a little drippings, 
roll it over in the glaze or gravy of the 
pan when that becomes brown at last, 
and make pan gravy when the meat is 
taken out the usual way. 



Cost of material — 3 lbs veal brisket 
at 10c loseo one half in boning, soup 
bones pay for the dressing — 2 lbs stuffed 
veal for 30, or 8 to 10 orders, 3c per 
plate. 



172— Ragout of Sweetbreads and 
Mushrooms. 



2 or 8 large sweetbreads, or 1 pound. 

^ can mushrooms. 

2 ounces butter — size of an q^^, 

1 tablespoon flour. 

Little minced onion and ham for sea- 
soning. 

Juice of 1 lemon. 

Cayenne iind salt. 

Fried shapes of bread for the border. 

Take the sweatbreads already cooked 
and cold, and cut them in large dice. 

Make the sauce for them in a deep 
saucepan, lirst putting in half the butter, 
a large teaspoonful of minced onion and 
a very thin slice of ham, and when these 
are cooked enough for flavor without 
browning put in the flour and stir the 
mixture over the fire until it begins to 
color. Then add gradually the mush- 
room liquor and a cupful of the liquor 
the sweatbreads were boiled in, let it 
boil up aod become thick. Add a pinch 
of cayenne. Next, melt the other piece 
of butter in a frying-pan, put in the 
mushrooms and the cup of sweetbreads 
and shake them about over the fire until 
they begin to show color; tike it off, 
squeeze in the juice of the lemon and 
strain in the thick sauce from the other 
vessel. Dish them heaped up in the 
center of a flat platter, or of small dishes 



for individual ordeis, and place a border 
of thin shapes of bread fried in lard 
around the edge. 

Cost of material — sweetbreads 30, 
mushrooms 15, butter 4, seasonings and 
croutons 4; 53c for 8 orders or 6 or 7c 
per plate. 

173~-Macaroniand Cheese— Bechamel. 



5 ounces Macaroni — J package. 

2 ounces cheese — J cup. 

2 ounces butter. 

1^ pmts milk, or water — 3 cups. 

2 eggs. Salt. 

Parsley and flour thickening. 

BoQ the macaroni by itself first, throw- 
ing it into water that is already boiling 
and salted. Let it cook only 20 minutes. 
Then drain it dry and put it into a pan 
or baking dish holding about three pints. 

Chop the cheese, not very fine, and 
mix it with the macaroni likewise the 
butter. Beat the two eggs and the pint 
of water or milk together, pour them on 
the macaroni and set in the oven to 
bake. While it is getting hot boil a cup 
of milk (the remaining half pint of the 
recipe), and thicken it with a rounded 
tablespoonful of flour mixed up with part 
of it in a cup, add salt and a tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, and when the 
macaroni in the oven is set so that the 
two cannot mix, pour this white cream 
sauce on top of it, shut up the oven, and 
let it bake a yellow brown. This makes 
a very attractive dish, as the yellow 
cheese and custard boils up in spots 
among the white sauce and parsley. 

Cost of material — macaroni 5, cheese 
3, butter 4, milk 2, eggs 4, seasonings 
1; 19c for 8 orders, 2^ per plate.

chopped parsley, and when these have 
boiled up a spoonful of flour thicken- 
ing. Fhake about, without putting a 
spoon in, until it thickens. 

175— Summer Squash. 

This vegetable should always be 
steamed, or at any rate not boiled in 
water, it being an object to get it as dry 
as possible so as to allow the addition 
of milk or cream when it is mashed. 
Shave off the outside thmly with a sharp 
knife; cut each squash in six or eight 
pieces. It depends upon the age and 
distinctness of the seeds whether they 
should be cut out or not if large enough 
to show prominently in the mashed equas-h 
take out the entire core. Squash cooks 
in about half an hour, and may be al- 
lowed to simmer and dry out more after 
mashing and seasoning, in a pan set 
upon a couple of bricks. 

176— Steamed Cherry Pudding. 



1 cup pitted cherries. , 

2 heaping cups flour,

salt, pour in the water and mix up as 
soft as it can be handled. Work the 
dough (m the table slightly by pressing 
in flat with the hands and doublmg over. 
Lay a bottom crust of it in a tin pud- 
ding pan that holds a quart; spread half 
the jjitted cherries on it, lay another 
crust on them, then the remainder of the 
cherries and a third sheet of dough on 
top. Set in a steamer and steam from 
30 to 45 minutes and serve while hot 
and light, with sauce. 



177 — Hard S auce. 

1 large cup powdered sugar, ^ pound. 

1 small cup tresh buttei, J pound. 

Grated nutmeg. 

Soften the butter but not melt it. 
Stir it and the sugar togetlier to a cream 
as in making cake. The more it is 
stirred (if in a bowl or dish and not in 
tin) the whiter it becomes. Spread it on 
a dish and grate nutmeg on top. Keep 
it cold until wanted. 

Good for all kinds of puddings, and 
can be colored pink by. adding while 
steaming a little red fruit ji^ice. . 

Cost — ^butter and sugar I3c. 

J78.— Sliced Apple Pie, Rich. 

Use this way only the best ripe cook- 
ing applies. Pare and core and slice 
them thin across the core hole, making 
rings. Fill paste-lined pie pans about 
two layers deep. Thinly cover the ap- 
ple slices with sugar, and grate nutmeg 
over. Put in each pie, butter about the 
size of a walnut and a large spoonful of 
water. Bake without a top crust slowly 
and dry. The apples become transpar- 
ent and half candied. 



Cost of material — cherries 10, flour 2, 
powder 2; 14 — hard sauce 13--27c for 
8 orders or 3Jc per plate. 



Cost of material — ^for 2 pies, puff 
paste 6, apples 2, sugar 3, butter 2; 
count 2 per plate . 

17&— Lemon Sherbet^ 

1 quart water. 

1 pund sugar. 

2 large lemons. 

3 whites of eggs. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons into a 
bowl and squeeze in the juice. Make a 
boiling syrup of the sugar and half the 
water, and pour it hot to the lemon zest 
and juice and let it remain so till cold, or 
as long as convenient, to draw ♦he flavor. 
Then add the rest of the water, strain 
into a freezer, freeze as usual, and when 
it is pretty well frozen, whip the whites 
to a froth, mix them in, beat up and 
fireeze again.

ISO^Small Cream Cakes. 



8 ounces granulated sugar — 1 cup. 

oeggs. 

4 ounces butter, melted — J cup. 

^ cup milk. 

12 ounces flour — 3 cups. 

1 teahpoonful baking powder. 

Beat the sugar and e^gs together a 
minute or two, add the melted butter, 
the milk, the powder and the flour. 
Slightly grease some baking pans and 
drop the batter by tablespoonfulgi to form 
little round cakes. Sprinkle granulated 
sugar on top of each one. Bake in a 
slack oven. The cakes run out rather 
thin and delicate and should have plenty 
of room. Take off with a knife when 
cold and place two together with pastry 
cream spread between. 



Cost of material — sugar 6 eggs 10, 
butter 8, milk 1, flour 2, powder 1;

cakes. 

181— Pastry Cream. 



1 cup milk — J pint. 

2 tablespoons sugar — 2 ounces. 

1 heaping tablespoon flour — 1 ounce. 

1 e/g. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

Lemon extract to flav,or. 

Boil the milk with a little of the su- 
gar iu it to prevent burning. Mix the 
rest of the sugar and the flour together 
dry, dredge them into the boiling milk, 
beating all the while, and let cook five 
minutes. Throw in the butter and beat 
the egg a little and stir in. Put the lid 
on and let cook at the back of the range 
about ten minutes longer. Plavor when 
nearly cold. 

Cost — 8 cents. 



Compote of Bananas with Rice. 
Peel the bananas and cut them in 
two across. Make a clear syrup like 
pudding sauce, drop in the bananas 
while it is boiling, then remove from 
the fire, as they do not need to cook, 
but. only scald. Stir a little sugar 
and butter into some cooked rice. 
Serve rice smoothed over in the dish, 
and bananas with sauce on top. Kum 
is the flavoring mostly used with 
bananas; it may be added to the 
sauce. A lemon cut up in it does as 
well. 

Banana Ambrosia. 
Cat up bananas and oranges in 
about equal proportions in a glass 
bowl, add grated cocoanut, powdered 



sugar, rock candy and wine to make 
a syrup, and anything else such as 
gum drops, almonds and crystalized 
fruits to make a brimming bowlful 
that may be desired, and mix all 
together. The ladies all know how 
to serve it. 

Macaroon Ice Cream. 
Use the rich kind of macaroons, 
known as soft macaroons; they are 
made like egg kisses with plenty of 
crushed almonds in to make them 
brown. Allow a pound of them to 
three pints of pure cream. Sweeten 
the cream with maraschino, chop the 
macaroons fine and mix them in. 
Freeze ; put it in a brick mould, pack 
and freeze again.

HOTEL DINNER. 



182— Puree of Bean Soup With Crusts. 



The special Beasomngs that make this 
Boup 'good are mnstard, butter and 
minced red pepper, to be added at last. 
A little of tbe liquor from the boiling 
corned beef or a knuckle bone of ham 
will improve the flavor. 

2 quarts of Boup stock. 

1 cupful of navy beans. 

1 tableppoon of minced onion. 

Butter size of an egg (optional). 

1 teaspionful of made mustard. 

Parsley, salt, little minced red pepper. 

Make the soup stock by boiling al- 
most any kind of meat and marrow 
bones in a gallon of water, with the 
usual soup bunch of various vegetables 
in it, until the liquor is reduced nearly 
one-half. Then strain it and skim off 
the fat. 

The trouble with this kind of soup of 
the bean puree settling to the bottom and 
leaving the liquid clear is caused through 
the beans being imperfectly cooked. 
Steep them in water over night and put 
a pinch of soda in the water they are 
cooked in, to help dissolve them, and 
when perfectly soft, mash them through 
a seive or gravy strainer. Have the 
stock boiling; pour it to the puree grad- 
ually and stir to mix; throw in the 
minced onion. Set on the side of the 
range or on bricks on the stove top, and 
let simmer 15 or 20 minutes. Season 
as already indicated. Add a spoonful 
of thickening along with the mustard. 
Sprinkle parsely over the surface. 
Serve with crusts. 



Cost — stock 8, beans 3, seasomngs 
5 crusts 2; 18c for 2 quarts. 



183— Crusts for Soup. 

It is a common fault to make these 
large and unsightly. When, in addition, 
they are burned in the oven, they spoil 
any soup, however well made. 



Shave away the dark crust from cold 
rolls or slices of bread; cut the bread in- 
to neat, dice shapes of even size, 
and toast it in a pan in the oven to a 
light brown color all over. Pour from 
six to twelve in each soup plate before, 
the soup. 

184— Baked Whitefish. 

Split the fish, after cleaning, down 
the back and take out the backbone!. 
Put some good, clear drippings to get 
hot in a baking pan. Wipe the fish, dip 
it in beaten q^^^ then dip it in flour and 
then in egg again, lay it in the pan of fat 
and bake it carefully at moderate heat-per 
haps with the oven door open — for about 
twenty minutes. Baste the exposed 
surface with the fat. Fisli looks ex- 
tremely rich cooked this way, yellow- 
brown and semi-transparent, if not al- 
lowed to get too hot while baking; yet 
the fat must be hissing hot when the fish 
is put in. Serve tomato sauce at the 
side. Garnish the fish with fried par- 
sley. 

Cost of material — fish 2 lbs. 25, 2 
eggs 4, seasonings and frying fat 3, 
sauce 3; 35 cents tor 8 orders or 4 to 5c 
per plate. 

Note — Whitefish does not lose much 
weight in cooking, and for the above 
method it is best if in thin and broad 
pieces — ^it takes less raw weight for a 
given number than most other kinds. 

185— Roast Leg of Mutton. 

For plain roast leg of mutton proceed 
in the same manner as for roast beef. 
Whether the mutton shall be rare done 
or well done must depend upon the 
preferences of those it is cooked for, but 
in either case the method is the same 
and the natural gravy should flow from 
a well-done leg ot mutton as weW as one 
under-done, if not in suchlarge quantity. 
It is best to make it a rule to always put 
a little salt in the pan the meat is roasted 
m, and water enough to cover the bottom, 



60 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



and if a made gravy is wanted some 
Fcraps and trimmings beside. The rea- 
son is that the gravy that oozes from 
these scraps, and that will escape from 
the meat, too, to some extent, will be 
found at the end of the roasting eticking 
to the bottom of the pan, while the 
grease is above it is clear it will dissolve 
as soon as the grease is poured off and 
water reaches it instead, but if there is 
no salt it h slow to dissolve. A spoonful 
of thickening will be needed in it. 

Let the leg of mutton have a good 
brown color on the outside, even if not 
done through. Turn it over by lifting 
the projecting bone, and do not pierce 
the meat with a fork. From 1 hour to 
2 will be required to roast it, according 
to size. 

Cost — per plate the same as roast beef. 



186— Beef Heart, Stuffed and Baked 



Boil the heart tender first, allowing 
about two or three hours, and let the 
water be nearly all boiled away at the 
finish, that the remaining liquor may be 
available for gravy. 

When the heart has boiled long enough 
cut out a portion of the middle and fill 
the cavity with stuffing. Set the heart 
in a pan in the oven with the liquor it 
was boiled in, and salt and pepper and 
bake brown. Cut the piece of heart 
into small pieces, put them to the liquor 
remaining in the pan and stir up with the 
fragments of dressing and a spoonful of 
thickening, making a savory thick sauce 
or ragout. 

Cosi^— heart 10, stuffing 5; 15c for 8 
©r 10 orders, or 2c per plate. 

187— Scrambled Brains in Patties. 



A good way to serve brains where 
there is but a small quantity available. 

1 set of brains or a capful. 

2 eggs. 

1 ounce of butter — small egg size. 
Parsley, pepper and salt. 
Puff paste for 8 shells. 



Simmer the brains in water, with salt 
and a little vinegar in it, about 20 min- 
utes. Take out, pick them over td re- 
move the dark portions, put them into 
a frying-pan with the butter, break in 
the eggs, and a little chopped parsley,^ 
pepper and salt, and stir all together 
over the fire until the eggs in it are soft 
cooked. Then till patty shells made of 
puff paste, put on the lids and ornament 
with a sprig of parsley. 

Scrambled brains as above also make 
a good breakfast dish without the pat- 
ties. It is common to put the brains in 
the pan raw, but not a good way, for it 
is difficult to get them cooked through 
without making them too dry, and almost 
impossible to free them from blood dis* 
colorations. 

The shells are formed in the same 
manner as directed for cherry tartlets, 
but may be oval or any other shape. 

Cost of material — brains 10, eggs 4, 
butter 2, seasonings 1, pastry 8; 25c for 
8 patties or 3c per plat3. 

188— Rice Croquettes with Currant 
Jelly. 

J cup rice, raw, — or 2 cups cooked. 

1^ cup water and milk. 

Butter size of a guinea egg — an ounce. 

1 tablespoon sugar. 

2 yolks, or 1 egg. 
Nutmeg. 

V Put the rice on to boil in a measured 
cupful of water, and when it is half done 
add J cupful of milk. It is an object to 
have the rice dry when done, and yet 
well cooked. Keep the steam shut in 
while it is cooking. When soft eno igh, 
mash it slightly with the back of a spoon, 
work in the other ingredients and a pinch 
of salt. Make it in shapes, with flour 
on the hands, like small biscuits, and 
make it hollow iu the middle to hold a 
spoonful of jelly. Having coated the 
shapes well with flour, fry them in a 
saucepan of hot lard. They will do 
without breading in egg and cracker 
meal. Put currant ielly in the depres- 
sion when dishing up.

12c for 8 croquettes with jelly or Ic 
each with only powdered sugar. 

189— Lobster Salad. 



Take the meat of one large lobster and 
cut it as near as may be in large dice 
shapes, or at least to uniform size, and 
keep the reddest pieces in a dish sepa- 
rate. Chop two heads of celery. Par- 
boil two or three green leaves of celery 
to make them a deeper green, and chop 
them with the celery likewise to color 
the whole. 

Spread a layer of the celery on a flat 
dish or platter, then the lobster on that 
with the red pieces around the edge, 
where they will show among the green, 
another layer of chopped celeiy on top, 
level over the top surface and pour and 
spread upon it some mayonaise dressing 
that is almost thin enough to run. The 
dressing should be suflSciently seasoned 
to season all the rest. 



Cost of material — lobster 20, celery 
5, dressing 9; 34c for from 8 to 12 dish- 
es, or from 3 to 4c per plate. 



190— Browned Sweet Potatoes. 



usually about an hour — then pour away 
the water and add a white sauce instead, 
and a slight sprinkling of minced pars* 
ley for ornament. 

192— Lemo n Cream Pie, Rich. 

2 cups milk — a pint.. 

4 tablespoons sugar — 4 ounces. 

2 heaping tablespoons flour. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

4 eggs — or the yolks only. 

1 small lemon, or some lemon extract 
and cream tartar. 

Mix the sugar and flour together dry 
and grate the rind of the lemon into 
them; boil the milk and stir the dry ar- 
ticles into it with a wire e^^ whisk. Add 
the butter and juice of the lemon and 
then the yolks of the eg2:s well beaten, 
but tako from the fire before they cook. 
Line pie pans with puff paste or tart 
paste. Pour in the cream and bake in a 
slack oven. When done meringue over 
as du*ected in other cases for lemon pies 
and meringues, using the whites of the 
eggs reserved for the purpose. 

Cost of material — milk 4, sugar fo» 
pies and meringue 6, butter and flour 2, 
eggs 9, lemon 2, crusts 6; 28c for 2 
large pies, or 10 portions or 3c per plate. 



If the potatoes are of good size pare 
them before cooking, split lengthwise and 
steam them until done. Turn them into 
a baking pan, sprinkle with salt, moisten 
with spoonfuls of fat from the roast 
meat pan and bake them a handsome 
brown. Sweet potatoes will not bake to 
a rich color and be really good unless 
they are first steamed or boiled thor- 
oughly done. Thin and stringy potatoes 
can be steamed first and peeled after- 
ward 



193— Custard Fritters Glazed. 



Cost — about Ic per plate. 
191— Stewed Turnips. 

Pare turnips deep enough to remove 
the rind that contains the pungent fla- 
vor. Boil in salted water until tender — 



A sort of sliced custard, breaded and 
fried, very rich and very generally liked, 
made of 

1 cup milk. 

2 tablespoons sugar.*

1 heaping tablespoon flour, 

2 yolks of eggs. 
Butter size of a walnut 
Flavoring. Pinch of salt. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it, 
which prevents burning. ]Mix the starch 
and flour in a cup, with a spoonful of

mixing and breading 8, flarvoring extracL 
1, cracker meal 2, lard to fry 4, sauce 
6; 28c for 8 orders or 3 to 4c per plate. 

194— Roman Cream. 



As it is always easier to make an arti- 
cle if it is known what it should be like 
when it is finished this may described as 
a dark yellow boiled custard stiffened 
with gelatine and whipped to a light 
spongy condition while cooling. 

1 pint milk. 

5 ounces sugar. 

1 ounce gelatine — light weight. 
Small piece stick cinnamon . 
J cup thick cream. 

6 yolks eggs. 

■J cup curacoa, or a wine substitute. 

Set the milk over the side of the fire, 
with the sugar, cinnamon and gelatine in 
it, and beat often with the wire egg 
whisk till the gelatine is all dissolved*^ 
which wdl be at about the boiling point! 
Beat the yolks light, mix them in like 
making custard, allow a few moments 
for it lo thicken but not boil, then strain 
into a tin pail or a freezer and set in ice 
water; when nearly cold whip the cream 
to froth and beat it in and add the cura- 
cora or other flavoring. Where there is 
DO cream whatever to be used for the 
purpose after beating up the gelatine 
cream quite light as it cools whip the 
whites of three eggs to froth and m^x in 
by beating. 

When the Roman cream has become 
cold enough in the ice water to be on 
tho point of setting pour it into small in- 
dividual molds if convenient, or it not 



dish up by spoonsful like ice cream out 
of the vessel it is made in. A spoonful 
of whipped cream poured around it like 
a sauce is an improvement. 

•Cost of material — milk 4, sugar 3, 
gelatine 16, cream 2, eggs 10, curacoa, 
rum or wine to flavor 15, ice to set 3; 
53c for 1 quart or 16 individual molds,, 
or about 4c per plate. 

Note — These creams, of which there 
are several kinds to be made, can be 
produced for one-half the above cost by 
the use of sheet gelatine, which is cheap, 
and the omission of the expensive liquor. 

195- Straw berry Meringue. 

This is sold extensively at the fine ba- 
keries under the name, generally, of 
strawberry shortcake. For the cake 
take 

8 ounces granulated sugar — 1 cup. 

5 eggs. 

4 ounces butter, melted — J- cup. 

■J cup of milk. 

12 ounces of flour — 3 cups. 

1 teaspooufill of baking powder. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together a 
minute or two, add the melted butter, 
the milk, the powder and the flour. 
Bake on jelly-cake pans as thin as it can 
be spread, or, if preferred, on a large 
shallow baking pan. The cake is liable 
to rise in the middle and must be spread 
on the pan accordingly. 

When done cover the top of the cake 
with raw strawberries and spread a thick 
covering of meringue on top of them. 
Set the cake in the oven one minute to 
bake a very light color on top, but the 
meringue paste must not be cooked 
through. 

The meringue paste or frosting is made 
by i (eating 5 whites of eggs to a firm 
froth and then mixing in 4 tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar. 

Cut m squares to serve. 

Cost of material— <;ake 27, strawber- 
ries 2 quarts 50, meringue 10; 87c for 
16 plates or 5Jc per plate- -or, according 
to size and the price of berries.

THE ICE CREAM SALOON. 



196— Ice Cream— Best. 



1 quart of good sweet cream. 
10 heaping tablespoons sugar. 

2 tablespoons extract vanilla. 

Put the the sugar and flavor into the 
cream. Set the pan or tin pail contain- 
ing it in ice water and whip with the 
wire egg-beater for about five minutes 
till the cream is half froth. Put it into 
a freezer that will hold twice as much, 
pack with ice and salt and freeze, and 
either by rapid motion of a freezer hav- 
ing an inside beater, or by beating the 
frozen cream with a paddle make it fill 
the freezer before leaving it. Other fla- 
voring extracts can of course be used m 
place of vanilla. 



Cost of material — cream 24, sugar 6, 
vanilla 4, twelve pounds ice 12, three 
pounds salt 3 — 49 cents for 2 quarts of 
ice cream or 12 plates, or 4c per plate. 



197— Cost of Ice Gream. 



There are but few things so uncertain 
as this, so much depending upon the price 
of ice and salt and so much more upon the 
method of proceeding to freeze it We 
have stated a supposable average with 
cream nt 90c per gallon, sugar at lie 
per pound and ice and salt each at Ic 
per pound. But undoubtedly while the 
cream is generally considered the most 
costly item the real expense is the freez- 
ing mixture. Ice at the cheapest is about 
50c per 100 pounds, yet it generally 
rules higher and ice cream often has to 
be made with ice at 3 dollars per hun- 
dred, and salt even of the coarsest, on 
account of the cost of transportation in 
some places runs up to an equal figure. 
It is necessary then to pay particular at- 
tention to the freezing process, for one 
person can freeze the cream as well with 
ten pounds of ice as another may with 
thirty. One will have it done and off 
hand within half an hour and another 



take all the forenoon to accomplish the 
same thing and may have to replenish 
the freezer three or four times over. 

When custards are to be frozen or im- 
itation cream made by enriching milk 
with eggs and starch it is obviously the 
best to let the boiling mixture become 
cold before .putting it into the freezer 
StiU where ice is very plentiful, as in 
winter, some time and trouble may be 
saved by not going through that prepa- 
tion, but the hot custard is strained di- 
rect into the freezer. In summer, how- 
ever much it may be desired to make the 
custard cold beforehand it ought never 
to be made over night without special 
care to make it thoroughly cold at once, 
for otherwise it is almost sure to ac- 
quire a curious sort of fermented taste, 
and will even in large quantities, throw 
up tiny bubbles of fermentation before 
morning, and all the high-priced flavor- 
ing extract that can be added will not 
quite disguise the spoiled taste. The 
proper way to do is to make the custard 
early in the morning, strain it into a 
freezer or tin pail and set it in ice water 
or the cold brine that is left in the freez- 
ing tub from the previous day, and when 
made cold by occasional stirring change 
it into the packed freezer it is to be 
frozen in. 



198— How to Freeze Ice Cream. 



Pound the ice quite fine. It seems to 
take longer at the beginning but it is by 
far the shorter plan in the end, for the 
large lumps that are crowded in to save 
the trouble of crushing do very little 
good and a person may turn a freezer 
packed with such large pieces for three 
hours without accomplishing the freezing. 
The quickest freezing is done with a 
mixture of fine ice and snow and salt. 

The large establishments that have 
the huge cog-wheeled freezers turned 
by steam power have ice crushers, a good 
deal like the rock crushers at the mines. 
A good and neat way on the smallest 
scale is to put ten pounds of ice into a 
burlap sack and pound it fine with a 



f>4 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL OAZETLES 



wooden manl or even with a hammer It 
is soon learned by practice how to do this 
without immediately destroying^ the sack. 

The rough and ready way for ordinary 
hotel work is to throw a fifty pound 
block into a large box and pound it fine 
with the head of an axe. 

Having your ice ready,place the freez- 
er with the cream in it. Put around it 
in the freezing tub about four shovelfuls 
of ice and on top of that one spoonful of 
the coarsest kind of salt you can get — 
bay salt like that seen sometimes in the 
barrels of salted mackerel — then more 
ice and salt till the freezing tub ia full, 
and let there be salt on top. Turn and 
keep the fine ice and the salt well mixed 
with it pressed and packed into close 
contact with the freezer, and in a short 
time, running from 20 to 30 minutes, the 
freezing will be complete. 

There is a hole large enough to admit 
a cork near the top of the freezing tub. 
That is to let the brine run off before it 
rises high enough to flow over the lid of 
the freezer; and another an inch or two 
above the bottom, which is to let out the 
brine when it begins to raise the ice from 
the bottom. But the brine from the 
melting ice and salt should not be kept 
too low, but should fill up all the spacei 
around the freezer which the ice is not 
fine enough to fill The brine in such a 
conditiun is colder than the ice itself, for 
salt water will not freeze until the tem- 
perature is a long way below freezing 
point of fresh water. This accounts for 
the ice cream remaining at the bottom of 
the freezer becoming so hard frozen after 
an hour or two in the brine. But there 
must always be ice present for the brine 
to act upon, consequently there must not 
be enough brine in the freezing tub to lift 
the ice from the bottom while the freezer 
is full. 

One can never calculate the cost of ice 
cream without knowing whether the art 
of freezing it expeditiously with the least 
possible consumption of ice wiU be well 
understood. 

In some hotels where ice cream is made 



every day the brine thus made of clear 
ice and clean salt can be utilized, put in 
barrels in which the cucumbers and man- 
goes as they are gathered daily in the 
garden may be dropped so keep them 
uniil they are eventually made into 
pickles. 

199— Corn Starcft Ice Cream. 



4 cups rich milk. 
10 tablespoons sugar. 

2 rounded tablespooua com starch. 

3 eggs. 

1 tablespoon lemon extract. 

This is the best and closest imitation 
of real cream and is moat generally in 
use wherever real cream cannot be ob- 
tained. But in order to give it the heat' 
ing up quality to increase the bulk and 
make it light and rich eating the eggs 
must be used strictly as directed. 

Separate the eggs and keep the whites 
cold. Beat the yolks with a basting- 
spoon of milk added in a large bowl. 
Boil the quart of milk with the sugar in 
it. ]\Iix the starch in a cup with a little 
cold milk and stir it in, and when it boils 
again pour it to the beaten yolks in the 
bowl. The heat will cook them suffi- 
ciently. Then strain, cool, and freeze in 
a freezer that will bold twice as much. 

When frozen nearly firm enough whip 
the whites to a froth, add them to the 
ice cream and work it either by rapid 
turning or with a wooden paddle until it 
fills the freezer. 



Cost of material — milk 8, sugar 6, 
starch and flour 3, eggs 5; 22c — ice and 
salt 15 — 37c for 2 quarts of ice cream 
or from 12 to 16 plates, according as 
dished up, or 2 to 3c per plate. 

Note — It is very unprofitable to serve 
ice cream in a half frozen state, in which 
condition it is as heavy as water and 
does not go as far. Neither is it good 
or protitable when allowed to stand and 
merely solidify or freeze itself without 
beating. It will seem rich and soflb 
however hard frozen if it is beaten up

although it may bo made only of milk. 
It pays therefore to have a good freez- 
er and sufficient ice to complete the 
freezing. 

200— Frozen Custard— Rich. 



4 cups rich milk. 

12 tablespoons sugar. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

Vanilla or other flavoring. 

Boil the milk with half the sugar iu it— 
which prevents burning. Beat the yolks 
in a large bowl with the rest of the su- 
gar iu and a half of cup of milk to make 
them come up frothing. Pour the boil- 
ing milk to them, then set on the fire for 
not more than a minute, as if too much 
cooked the custard will not come up 
light and rich in the freezer. 

Strain, flavor and freeze. 

Cost of material — milk 8, sugar 7, 
flavor 2, yolks 15; 32 — ice and salt 15 — 
47 cents for something less than 2 quarts. 
About the same cost as pure cream, or 
4c per plate. 

201— New York Ice Cream. 



Known as Delmonico*s ice cream, but 
most people are averse to printing it so in 
every hotel bill of faro. Nearly the 
same as the foregoing with gelatine ad- 
ded to produce extreme lightness. 

3 cups good milk. 

1 cup sweet cream. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

A vanilla bean. 

10 tablespoons sugar. 

J package gelatine or less than -J 
ounce. 

Set the milk on to boil with the sugar, 
gelatine and vanilla bean (or part of one) 
in it The kettle should be set at the 
side of the range where the milk will 
heat up gradually giving the gelatine 
time to dissolve, with frequent stirring 
from tlie bottom- The sheet gelatine can 
be used but is liable to curdle the milk 
if allowed to boil in it, which the pack- 
age kind does not. 



Add a little milk to the yolks in a 
large bowl to make them capable of be- 
ing beaten up light. Whip them light 
as sponge cake. Pour the boiling milk 
to them and strain into the freezer. 
Wipe th« vanilla bean and put away to 
be used the same way again. When the 
custard has become cold and begun to 
freeze whip the cup of cream to froth, 
stir it m and finish the freezing as 
usual, working the ice cream until it is 
twice its original bulk. 

Cost of material — milk and cream 12, 
sugar 6, gelatine 5, vanilla 5, yolks 12; 
40 cents — ice and salt 15 — 55c for over 
2 quarts or, according, to the way of 
dishing up, from 12 to 16 plates or 4c 
per plat& 

Note — ^The genteel way of serving ice 
creams in small individual shapes has in 
it also the purpose of serving as a meas- 
ure of quantity. Where there is an 
abundance of good things served and the 
ice cream is only one among many it may 
be quite suflScient to make twenty-four 
dishes of two quarts of ice cream, while 
on the other hand in a saloon the size of 
the dish is an object with the customer. 
There are ice eream ladles made that 
form the cream in conical and dome 
shapes to go in the saucers, and these 
can be had of different measures to suit 
the particular case. 



202— Corn 



-Starch Ice 
out Eggs. 



Cream With- 



The former corn-starch cream has the 
cream color; this is pure white and while 
it answers to make at times when neither 
eggs nor cream can be obtained it is also 
valuable for fancy ices where different col- 
ors are required, and besides serving for the 
perfectly white it takes a handsomer red 
color from strawberry syrup or other col- 
oring than a yellow cream or custard 
will. ■ . 

4 cups milk. 

12 tablespoons sugar. 

^ ounce butter. 

2 rounded tablespoons com starch.

Fiavorinp^. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. 
Mix the starch in a cup with a little cold 
milk and stir it in while the milk is boil- 
ing. Take it from the tire and throw in 
the small lump of b itter and beat till it 
is dissolved. The butter is not so much 
for flavor as to make the starch cream 
white, opaque and smooth and not semi- 
transparent like milk as it would be 
without that addition. 

Strain, cool, and flavor and freeze as 
usual. 

This kind will not rise and increase in 
bulk much in the freezer as it is, but if 
2 whites of eggs can be had whip them 
light and stir in when the cream is nearly 
frozen and it will make a difierence in 
the quantity provided rapid turning or 
beating is resorted to. 



Cost of material — milk 8, sugar 7, 
butter 1, starch and flavoring 2; — 18 
cents — ice and salt 15 — 33 cents for 
about 3 pints or 12 plates, or 3c per 
plate. 



Note. — As a rule the richer a cream 
may be the more ice and salt it takes to 
freeze it, and the less sugar in the 
cream the sooner it will become solid. 
The plain cream of the foregoing receipt 
will freeze in half the time that may be 
required for a rich yellow custard. 



203— Chocolate Ice Cream. 



It is never very good when made with 
any kind of custard or imitation cream 
and ought to be made only when real 
cream is to be had . 

4 cups cream. 

1 ounce common chocolate. 

1 heaping cup sugar. 

1 tablespoon vanilla. 

Chocolate cream is generally too 
strongly flavored for the majority. The 
imported sweet kinds are made of half 
sugar and more of such chocolate can of 
course be used, but the common unsweet- 
'.ned is the kind generally furnished. 



The ounces are marked on ihe cakes. 
Otherwise use a half cup dry grated. 

Boil a little milk with some sugar in 
it, put in the grated chocolate and beat 
up over the fire until it is melted then 
strain it into the freezer, put in the cream 
and sugar, freeze and beat up well to 
make it a rich bright color. 

The chocolate can also be mixed in the 
cream by only melting it in a saucepan 
set in a rather warm place, with nothing 
added, but it does not do to pour it into 
the cold cream without previously dilut- 
ing it with a little thoroughly beaten in 

Cost — Same as best ico cream. 



204 — Ordinary Frozen Custard. 

1 quart of milk. 

3 eggs. 

1 small cup sugar, 

^ a peach tree leaf for flavor. 

Boil half the milk with the peach leaf 
and the sugar in it; beat the eggs in a 
bowl, pour some boiling milk to them, 
set on the fire again and in one minute, 
or as soon as it shows signs of boiling up 
again take it off and add the cold milk to 
stop the cooking. Strain into the freezer, 
flavor and freeze. 



Note — There is a point in cooking 
custards when they are at the richest and 
that is exactly at the boiling point. The 
custard is then creamy and as thick as it 
will ever be. A few seconds more of the 
fire may spoil it or at least make it thin 
and full of grains of curd. This is a 
great point to know in making all such 
sauces and soups as are thickened with 
eggs as well as sweet custards. A pint 
or two may thicken almost as soon as it 
touches the fire but a gallon may require 
several minutes . 

The ordinary custard made as above 
being less trouble to prepare than the one 
thickened in part with starch is oftenest 
madn where no particular interest is felt 
in the quality of the cooking, and earns 
abuse often bestowed upon hotel ice 
cream, nevertheless if half cream o^ even

a quarter can be had and the custard 
is carefully cooked it may prove to be 
equal to that made with all pare cream. 

205— Bisque Ice ureams. 

Ice creams with a proportion of the 
pulp of pounded fruit or nuts added are 
termed bisques. 

206— Bisque of Pineapple ice Cream. 

1 can pineapple or f pound. 

2 cups sugar. 
4 cups cream. 

Chop the pineapple small and put it 
in a J3right pan or kettle with the sugar 
and a few spoonfuls of juice or water to 
dissolve the sugar to syrup. Simmer at 
the side of the range a short time. 

Whip the cream till it is halt froth, 
then freeze it first by itself, because the 
pineanpie added before freexing has a 
tendency to curdle it. Pound the pine- 
apple and syrup through a colander, mix 
it with the partly frozen cream, and 
freeze again. 

It can and ought to be managed to 
have the pineapple in syrup prepared 
beforehand to be cold. In making these 
bisquos it is not best to pound the fruit 
perfectly fine but the small pieces about 
like grains of wheat should be percepti- 
ble and show that the creams are mixed 
with fruits and not merely flavored. 

Cost of material — pineapple 20, sugar 
10, cream 24; 64 cents — ice and salt 
20 — 74 cents for 2 quarts or about 6c 
per plate. 

207— Bisque of Preserved Ginger. 

•J pound of either preserved or can 
died ginger. 

1 cup sugar. 

Juice of 1 lemon. 

4 cups cream. 

Cu* the candied ginger into very 
small pieces. Make a hot syrup of the 
sugar with a few spoonfuls of water and 
squeeze the lemon into it, then put in the 
ginger and let it soften and impart the 



flavor to the syrup. Put the cream and 
ginger and syrup all together, freeze and 
beat up. 

Cost of material — ginger 30, sugar 
6, lemon 2, cream 24; 62 cents — ice and 
salt 20 — 82c for 2 quarts or 12 plates or 
7c per plate. 

208— Italian Bisqu e Ice Cream. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 cups milk. 

2 cups cream. 

8 or 10 lady-fingers (pairs). 

3 yolks of eggs. 
J cup madeira. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it, 
crnmble in the lady fingers, add the 
yolks and stir over the fire a mimite. 
Put it into the freezer with the wine and 
cream, freeze, and heat up. 

Cost of material — milk and cream 
16, sugar 6, cakes 5, eggs 4, wine 10* 
41 cents — ice and salt 20— 61c for 2 
quarts or 12 plates or 5c per plate. 

209— Bisq ue of Almonds. 

J pound almonds. 

4 cups cream. 

1 heaping cup sugan 

Scald the almonds and take off the 
skins. Pound them a few at a time in a 
mortar with a little sugar and teaspoon* 
ful of water. . They need not be a per- 
fectly smooth paste, for the reason stated 
under the head of bisque of pineapple, 
but when all are pounded mix them with 
the cream and sugar and pass it through 
a coarse strainer into the freezer. Freeze 
and beat up as usual. This is perfectly 
white. 

Cost of material — almonds 30,. cream 
24, sugar 8; 62 cents — ^ice and salt 15 — 
77c for 2 quarts or 12 plates or 6 or 7c 
per plate. 

210 - Brown Bi sque o f Hickory Nuts. 

J pound of hickory nut kernels. 

1 heaping cup sugar 

4 cups cream. 

Pick over the kernels to free them 



68 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



from fragments of shell, and pound them 
like almonds in a mortar with a little 
sugar and a few drops of water added. 
Only a few can be eflfectually pounded at 
a time. They should be like meal, to 
go through a coarse strainer. In order 
to make the cream about the color ot 
light coffee and cream and to give it a 
good flavor put two tablespoons sugar in 
a very small saucepan without water 
and melt it over the fire and let it bum 
to the color of molasses, then add a little 
water let it boil up and dissolve. Put 
the cream into the freezer, strain in the 
caramel and pounded nuts and freeze. 

Cost — 6 or 7c per plate 

211— Fruit Ice Creams. 



These have the fruit mixed with the 
cream either whole or in large pieces. 

There is one rule to be observed all 
through, and that is to add the fruit late, 
when the cream is already frozen and it 
is nearly time to serve it, for the reason 
that fresh fruit freezes easily and some 
kinds become as hard ;is rocks and taste- 
lees and useless. The exceptions are 
the very sweet fruits which will not 
freeze solid at all, and tho^e made very 
Bweet like pmeapple stewed in syrup. 

212— White Cherry ice Cream. 

4 cups cream. 
2 cups sugar. 

5 cups California white wax cherrie 
J cup water. 

Slake a boiling syrup of the sugar and 
water, drop in the cherries and let them 
simmer in it about 15 minutes, without 
stirring or breaking. Then strain the 
flavored syrup into the freezer and set 
the fruit on ice, to be mixed in at last. 
Add the quart of cream to the syrup in 
the freezer, freeze and beat up well, then 
stir m the cherries and pack down with 
more ice and salt 



Cost of material — cream 24, cherries 
24, sugar 10; 58 cents— ice and salt 
20 — 68c for 2 quarts — about 6c per plate 



213— Red Cherry Ice Cream. 

4 cups cream. 
2 cups sugar. 

5 cups red cherries. 
J cup water. 

UTse only the light red cherries for this 
purpose, for the dark kinds make an un- 
pleasant color. 

Boil the water and sugar together and 
drop the cherries in. Let simmer at the 
side of the range a {qw minutes without 
stirring or breaking them. Then strain 
the syrup into the freezer and set the 
fruit on ice to be mixed in at last. Add 
the quart of cream to the syrup in the 
freezer, freeze and beat up well, then add 
the cherries and cover down till wanted. 



214— Pineapple Fruit Ice Cream. 

1 can pineapple, or a pound. 

2 cups sugar. 
4 cups cream. 
^ cup water 

Cut the pineapple in small dice. Make 
a boiling syrup of the sugar and water, 
stew the pineapple in it, then strain the 
flavored syrup into the freezer and set 
the fruit on ice to become cold. Add the 
cream to the syrup, freeze and beat up 
and stir in the prepared pinapple at last. 

Cost — pineapple 20, sugar 10, cream 
24, ice and salt 20; 74 cents or 7c per 
plate. 

215— White Grape Ice Cream. 

Make the same as directed for white 
cherries. 



216- Strawberry Fruit Ice Cream. 

1 quart strawberries — red, ripe and 
sweet. 

2 cups sugar. 
4 cups cream. 
•J cup water. 

The fruit need not be cooked as in the 
case of the preceding kinds, cover the 
strawberries with the sugar and let then 
remain some time to form a thick red syrup. 



COOKING FOn PROFIT, 



69 



Pick out half of them to be added after 
the freezing, and rub the remaining half 
with their synip through a strainer into 
the freezer. Add the cream, freeze and 
beat up and at last stir in the whole 
strawberries. 



Cost — About the same as the other 
fruit ice creams, varying with the price 
of fresh fruit. 



217- -Peach Fruit Ice Cream. 



4 cups of peeled and cat peaches. 

4 cups cream. 

2 cups sugar. 

Peach extract to flavor. 

Make a peach-flavored ice cream. 
Mix some of the sugar with the cut 
peaches and mix them in after the cream 
is frozen. 



218—106 Cream With Strawberries. 



Make any kind of plain ice cream or 
frozen custard according to directions al- 
ready given and dish up a spoonful of 
berries on top in the saucer. Ice cream 
with rasberries or cut peaches the same 
way. 

219— Frozen Puddings. 

Sometimes called ice puddings. Some 
are as cheap as the commonest ice cream, 
others are quite expensive . They make 
a welcome variation either to serve alone 
like ice cream or for two kinds together. 

220— Frozen Cocoanut Pudding. 

4 cups milk. 

1 cup sugar. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

\ pound of grated cocoanut. 

Make the custard as usual and stir in 
the cocoanut while it is still warm after 
straining. Freeze and beat as lisuaL A 
little lemon or orange flavoring can be 
added. 

The ordinary ice cream or starch cus- 
tard can be used the same way as well. 



Cost of material — 25c per quart or 8 
plates or 3c per plate. 

221— Frozen Tapioca Pudding. 

3 cups milk. 

6 tablespoons sugar — 5 oz, 

2 tablespoons pearl tapioca. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

2 eggs. 

^ cup cream to whip in at last. 

Flavoring. 

The pearl Tapioca is the most suitable. 
If the large grained sort is used crush it 
ou the table with the rolling-pin and then 
sift away the dust 

Steep the tapioca 2 hours in a cup of 
milk cold, but set in a warm place. Boil 
the rest of the milk with the sugar in it, 
then add the steeped tapioca, cook for 
15 minutes. Stir in the butter, then the 
eggs, and take the custard immediately 
off the fire, cool, flavor with vanilla or 
lemon, and freeze like ice cream, and 
when nearly finished add the \ cup of 
cream whipped to a froth, and beat weU. 

Cost of material — milk 6, sugar 3, 
tapioca and flavoring 3, eggs 4, butter 
and cream 4; 20 cents — ice and salt 15 — 
35c for 3 pints or 8 to 12 plates, or 3 to 
4c per plate, 

222— Frozen Rice Pudding. 



3 cups milk. 

2 tablespoons rice. 

6 tablespoons sugar. 

6 yolks of eggs, 

J cup of cream. 

Piece of stick cinnamon. 

Wash the rice; put it in the milk and 
the sugar likewise, and an inch length 
of stick of cinnamon, and let simmer 
slowly at the side of the range until the 
grains are tender — about ^ hour. Beat 
the yolks with a spoonful of milk, pour 
some of the boiling rice-milk to them, 
then set all over the fire again about a 
minute to nearly boil. Take out the 
cinnamon. Cool, freeze, add the cream 
whipped, and finish freezing. 



70 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL OAZETIES 



Cost — same as tapioca pudding pre- 
ceding. 

Note. — These as well as all other 
custards and puddings are richar both in 
taste and color when made with the yolks 
of eggs than with whole eggs, and when 
there is no cream to be had the whites 
whipped to froth may be added instead 
just before the freezing is finished » This 
addition not only increases the volume 
but gives the frozen custard a soft and 
creamy taste. 

223— Frozen Sago Pudding. 

3 cups milk. 

6 tablespoons sugar. 

2 tablespoons best white sago. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

2 eggs — or 3 yolks. 

J cup cream to whip in. 

Flavoring. 

Put on the milk with the sugar and 
Bago in it, stir from the bottom once or 
twice lest the sago stick at the first heat- 
ing, and let simmer until the grains are 
transparent — about 20 minutes. Then 
add the beaten eggs and the butter, cool, 
flavor and freeze and beat in the whipped 
cream. 



CobT — same as tapioca and rice pud- 
dings. 

Note. — The reason for using butter in 
these preparations of starch, tapiaco and 
sago is to whiten them Without it they 
have more or less of a bluish, semi-trans- 
parent appeajance that is not rich, but 
the addition of butter well beaten in 
makes the fluid portion white as milk 
and leaves the grains distinct to show up 
the compound for what it is. This is 
especially useful to know when eggs are 
dear and scarce and large quantities of 
these puddings are needed for hotel use. 

224— Frozen Apple Pudding. 

Freeze the following compote of apples 
in one freezer and either of the three or 
four kinds or frozen pudding of the fore- 



going receipts in anno^her, and dish up 
a half portion in the saucer with the 
spoonful of apple ice in the centre. 

2 or 3 ripe, mellow apples. 

6 tablespoons sugar. 

IJ cups water. 

J a lemon. 

Put on the sugar and ^ cup water to 
boil, and pare and cut the apples in small 
pieces of even size. Put into the boiling 
syrup a piece of the lemon rind shaved 
off thin and more or less of the lemon 
juice, and then stew the pieces of apple 
in it, taking them out before they get too 
well done. Set the pieces on ice. Add 
the remaining cup of water to the syrup, 
strain and freeze — it makes a whitish 
sort of ice — and add the apples to it at 
last and cover down with more ice and 
salt to finish the freezing. 



Cost — About the csame per quart as 
the rice pudding. 



225— Frozen Nesseirode Pudding. 

Glace Nesseirode or iced pudding. A 
frozen custard made of pounded chest- 
nuts, with fruit and flavorings: 

1 pound of large chestnuts — about 40- 

1 pint of rich boiled custard. 

1 cup sweet cream. 

2 ounces citron. 

2 ounces sultana raisins. 

2 ounces stewed pineapple. 

J cupful of maraschino. 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

Pinch of salt in the chestnut pulp. 

Slit the shells of the chestnuts, boil 
them half an hour, peel clean, and pound 
the nuts to a paste, and rub it through a 
coarse sieve, moistening with cream. 
Then mix it with the boiled custard. 
Freeze this mixture, and when firm whip 
the cup of cream, and stir it in and freeze 
again. Then add the citron cut in 
shreds, the stewed or candied pineapple, 
likewise the raisins, maraschino, and 
vanilla extract. Beat up and freeze 
again, and either serve in ice cream 
plates out of the freezer, or pack the

cream in a mold, and when well frozen 
Bend to table whole, turned out of the 
mold on to a folded napkin on a dish. 

Cost of material— chestnuts 20, cus- 
tard (2 cups milk, 4 yolks, 4 tablespoons 
sugar) 13, cream 6, raisins 3, citron 5, 
pineapple 3, maraschino 20, vanilla, 2; 
72 cents — ^ice and salt 23— 95c for 1^ 
quarts. 



Note. — The foregoing makes about 
enough to fill one of those brick molds 
that have a large and deep stamped fruit 
pattern in the lid and when frozen firm 
it can be sliced into from 12 to 16 por- 
tions. If dished up by spoonPulsout of 
the freezer and made a little less heavy 
with fruit it is practicable to make 2 
quarts of the same material. When 
chestnuts are not convenient some of the 
large cafes use the ready prepared 
pounded almonds or walnuts that may 
be bought by the can at the confection- 
ers* supply stores, and various additions 
or substitutions of green candied fruits 
are employed to make a handsome ap- 
pearing compound without changing its 
general character. 

226— Tutti Fruttl. 



2 cups milk. 

6 tablespoons sugar, 

4 yolks eggs. 

J cup curacoa. 

•^ cup thick cream. 

1 pound of French candied fruits of 
different colors— or else use a mixture o^ 
cut figs, sultana raisms, dates and greea 
candied citron and blanched almonds. 

Put a spoonful of sugar in the small- 
est saucepan and bum it to caramel — 
not too dark — and add a little water to 
dissolve it. Make a yellow boiled cus- 
tard of the milk, sugar and yolks, color 
it with the caramel, add the curacoa for 
flavor, strain, add the whipped cream 
when cold and freeze and beat up. Cut 
the fmits to the size of cranberries, mix 
them in and cover down the freezer with 
a fresh relay of ice and salt May be 



served by spoonfuls out of the freezer or 
packed in a brick mold, turned out and 
sliced. 



Cost of material — The same as Nes- 
sebode, or about 60c per quart, depend- 
ing somewhat upon the cost of the can- 
died fruit and curacoa or their substi- 
tutesL 



227— Neapolitan Ice Cream or 
Pocchi. 



Occhi 



Make 3 colors of ice cream or 2 creams 
and 1 water ice m different freezers, and 
when they are frozen medium hard place 
them in layers as even as possible in a 
brick shaped neapolitan mould. Let the 
first layer, about an inch deep be of 
rich yellow frozen custard made with 
yolks of eggs and milk as already else- 
where directed; having smoothed that 
over spread another layer an inch deep 
of pink strawberry ice cream or red 
cherry water ice or other red kind, and 
on that spread another layer of white ice 
cream, either pure cream frozen or a com 
starch cream made without yolks of 
6ggs, or else a white orange or lemon 
ice. Three colors of cream are to be 
chosen, however, in preference to any 
water ice when they can be had, be- 
cause they freeze of even density. A 
chocolate or caramel cream will answer 
instead of red. 



228— Neapolitan Molds and How ta 
Manage Them. 

Properly made molds have a bottom 
lid as well as top. They can be bought 
at the furnishing stores. The large es- 
tablishments, however, find it less trouble 
to use plain tin boxes almost identical in 
size and shape with the common wooden 
cigar boxes. They have a tight fitting 
top lid, and before being filled are lined 
with maniUa paper, by means of which 
the brick of ice cream nfrer being fiimly 
frozen can easily be withdrawn It is 
an advantage to use a paper lining in 
whichever kind of mold may be em- 
ployed. Where ice is plentiful, when 



72 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



the freezers have been emptied into the 
molds these may be pkced in the same 
freezers, well covered down and allowed 
to remain thei« two or three hoars to 
become firm. If there is the least risk 
of' the inside not being cold enough, 
however, immerse the molds in a tub of 
pounded ice and salt by themselves. Be- 
fore doing so the joints of the lids should 
be closed, if not made tight enough with 
paper, by brushing with melted butter 
to fill up the spaces where salt might 
get in. 

When the molds have remained in the 
freezing mixture 2 or 3 hours wash off the 
outside, take out the shape of ci-eam and 
wrap it in dry manilla paper and put it 
back in the freezer, well packed, to re- 
main until it is to be sliced and served. 

All kinds of ice creams and frozen 
puddings in single colros are thus frozen 
in bricks and served in slices. When to 
be served at a party table whole the 
stamped ornamental lid may have the 
fruit or flower form filled with a colored 
ice that will show in relief upon the plain 
form. These forms are served upon a 
folded napkin in a dish, in some cases, 
but are better placed in a silver dish 
having a drainer bottom on the plan of a 
butter dish. 

Among the labor-saving expedients to 
secure the ornamental tri-colored brick of 
cream without making different kinds 
the principal is the employment of the 
prepired vegetable colors, to be obtained 
of the manufacturers of flavoring extracts, 
by which one large freezer of ice cream 
may be made to take as many different 
Lues as may be desired. 

Cost of molded creams — This is quite 
out of proportion to the cost of ingredi- 
ents. The extra time and labor and 
consumption of ice probably will be found 
to double the expense. 

229-fSherbet8 

Sherbets are water ices \sith either 
calf 'sfoot jelly or gelatine or white of 
eggs, or dissolved gum added to make 
them smooth and capable of being beaten 



to a light and foamy condition. We give 
examplef only of the use of white of eggs, 
it being the simplest and most generally 
available, A remainder of table jelly 
of the kind usuuUy made for hotel des- 
sert can be used in the same way. 

230— L emon Sherbet, 

2 lemons. 

\\ cups sugar — 12 oz. 

3 cups water. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons into a 
bowl and squeeze in the juice. Make a 
boiling syrup of the sugar and half the 
water and pour it hot to the lemon zest 
and juice and let remain so till cold. 
Then add the rest of the water, strain 
the lemonade into a freezer, freeze as 
usual, and at last add the whites whip- 
ped to a firm froth, beat and freeze again 
The scalding draws the flavor of the 
lemon; it should never, however, be 
boiled and fewer lemons should be used 
when they are large. The sherbet is 
perfectly white. 

Cost — lemons 5, sugar 7, whites of 
eggs 3; 15c — ice and salt 15 — 30 cents 
for 3 pints (if thoroughly frozen and 
beaten) or 12 plates; or 2 or 3 cents 
each. 

231— O range S herbet. 

2 or 3 oranges — according to size. 

3 cups water. 

1 large cup sugar. 

1 lemon — juice only. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Grate the yellow rind of one or two of 
the oranges into a bowl, squeeze in the 
juice of all, without the seeds, and the 
juice of half the lemon. ^lake a boiling 
syrup of the sugar and half the water 
and pour it to the grated lind in the 
bowl. Let remain until cold. Strain it 
into the freezer, add the rest of the 
water, freeze, add the whipped whites, 
beat up and finish freezing. 

This sherbet is cream white tinged 
with the orange zest and juice. 

Cost — same as lemon sherbet.

232— White Cherry Sherbet. 



4 cups white cherries without stems. 

IJ cups sugar. 

2 cupa water. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Mash the fruit raw and thoroughly so 
as to break the stones, and strain the 
juice through a fine strainer into the freez- 
er. Boil the cherry pulp with some of 
the sugar and water to extract the flavor 
from the kernels, and ma?h that also 
through the strainer, add the other pint 
of water and the sugar and freeze. Then 
add the whipped whites and finish freez- 
ing. This sherbet is not distinguishable 
from cream as long as it remains frozen. 
It is a gotid plan to drop in a lew whole 
cherries that have been simmered in 
syrup, to show what kind of ice it is. 
Canned cherries are good enough. 



Cost of material — cherries 25, sugar 
7, white of eggs 3; 35 cents — ice and 
salt 15 — 40c for 3 pints, or 3 to 4c per 
plate or glass. 



233— Grape Sherbet. 

Only the kinds of grapes that yield a 
colorless juice can be used this way. 
The others turn to a very bad color. 

5 cups sweet muscat grapes. 

1 cup angelica or other sweet wine. 

1 cup water. 

1 cup sugar. 

1 lemon — juice only. 

2 whites of eggs. 

St«w the grapes with the sugar and 
water, then rub them through a strainer 
into the freezer, with the lemon juice 
and syrup, and add the wine and freeze. 
When nearly finished put in the whip- 
ped whites beat up and finish the freez- 
ing Some ripe grapes of any kind, not 
cooked, may be dropped into this sher- 
bet as suggested for white cherries. 

Cost — According to locality and cost 
of grapes and wine — average 5c per 
plate. 



234 — Pineapple Sherbet. 

1 can of pineapple— or i of a pineapple. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 cups water. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Make a boiling syrup of the sugar, 
the pineapple juice and part of the water. 
Chop the fruit, simmer it a few minutes 
m the syrup then mash through a strainer 
into the freezer, using the remainder of 
the water to help it through. Freeze, 
add the whites whipped and beat up and 
finish freezing. 

Note. — The canned pineapple is gen- 
erally riper and sweeter than the fresh 
fruit that is sent to Northern markets. 
When the latter is used it shoulvl be cut 
up, have hot syrup poured over and al- 
lowed to steep till cold. Two cans con- 
tain about 1^ pounds of pineapple. The 
juice of a lemon is sometimes added to a 
pineapple ice when the fruit is very sweet. 

Cost of material — about the same as 
cherry sherbet, or 25 to 30c per quart or 
4c per plate. 

235— P each Sherbet. 

3 cups of sliced mellow peaches. 

1 large cup sugar. 

2 cups water. 

The kernels of half the peaches, or ^ 
a peach leaf. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Make boiling syrup of the sugar and 
water stew the peach kernels and put in 
it a few minuies to extract the flavor, 
pass through a strainer into the freezer, 
freeze, add the whites and freeze again. 

Cost— Same as lemon sherbet, 2 to 
3c per plate. 

236— Water Ices. 

The same as the sherbets with the 
white of eggs or gelatine left out, except 
that as Ji rule they cannot be well made 
with cooked or scalded fruit as sherbets 
can, but should have the expressed juice 
of the raw fruit mixed with water and 
sugar. Some kinds of fruit, especially 



74 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL OAZETUrS 



cherries, giapes and peaches have the 
gumrny property that causes them to be- 
come light and white in the freezer if 
beaten much, precisely as if eggs or jel- 
ly had been added; consequently when 
water ices are desired to serve almost as 
beverages at evening parties they are 
better frozen in an old fashioned freezer, 
Bcrapea down from the sides with a 
palette knife and not beaten too much. 



237- -Strawberry Water Ice. 

1 quart strawberries. 

2 cups sugar. 

3 cups water. 

Cover the strawberries with the sugar 
and let them remain some time to form a 
thick red syrup. Pick out a few of the 
berries to be mixed in the ice at last. 
Rub the rest through a strainer into the 
freezer with the syrup and add the water. 
Freeze without much beating if a crimson 
ice is wanted, and add coloring if neces- 
sary. Throw the reserved berries on 
top of the strawberry ice in the freezer 
and mix them in when the ice is to be 
served. • 



Cost of material — strawberries 25, 
sugar 10, ice and salt 15; 50c for 3 pints 
or from 8 to 16 plates or glasses, or 3 or 
4 cents each. 



238~Lemon Water Ice. 



The same as lemon sherbet without 
the white of eggs. A good strong lem- 
onade made in the common way answers 
as well to freeze; the difference is that it 
takes three times as many lemons as by 
the other method of scalding the grated 
rind to draw the flavor. 



239— Raspberry Water Ice. 

3 cups raspberriea 

1-J cups sugar. 

2 cupp water. 

Mash the berries and ougar together 
and rub them through a strainer into the 
freezer using the water to help when the 



pulp is dry. Freeze without much 
beating. 

Cost — same as strawberry water ice. 
Three pints. 

240— Pineapple Water Ice. 



Scald the the sliced fruit in syrup as 
in making pineapple sherbet and force a 
portion of it through a strainer that will 
not let the fibrous part pass through. It 
is the same as the sherbet without the 
white of eggs, but will not make so much 
in bulk. 



241— Orange Water Ice. 



Same as orange sherbet without the 
white of eggs. 

242— Cherry Water Ice. 

4 cups sweet red or black cherries. 

2 cups water. 

IJ cups sugar. 

Mash the fruit raw and thoroughly so 
as to break the stones, and strain the 
juice through a fine strainer into the 
freezer. Boil the cherry pulp with some 
of the sugar and water to extract the 
flavor from the kernels, and mash that 
also through the strainer, add the other 
pint of water and the sugir and freeze. 
Beat the ice only enough to make it even 
and smooth. 



Cost of material — cherries 20, sugar 
8, ice and salt 15; 43 cents for 3 pints or 
12 glasses or 3 to 4c each. 



243— Peach Water Ice. 



Is best made with soft, raw yellow 
peaches. Use the same proportions as 
for sherbet; rub the pulp through a 
strainer with most of the sugar mtished 
with it, and make a syrup of the rest 
and stew the peach kernels or half a 
peach leaf in it for more flavor. Same as 
peach sherbet without the white of eggs.

245— Frozen unch es. 



These are sherbets and water ices 
with spiritoua liquors added and are of 
two classei?. They are (according to the 
French usage) Roman punches when they 
are beaten up with meringue or white of 
eggs like the sherbets ot the preceding 
receipts, and plain iced punches when 
not so whitened and are in a semi-trans- 
parent condition. 

Some of these punches cannot be fro- 
Kon quite solid and must be served in 
glasses in a half fluid condition as bev- 
erages, on account of the spirit and sugar 
they contain and all of thsm take more 
ice and salt to freeze them than any mix- 
ture without liquors. The stronger they 
are made the harder they are to freeze. 

246 — Roman Punch. 



1 pint water — 2 cups. 
10 ounces sugar — 1^ cups, 
1 lemon — juice and rind. 

1 orange — -juice only. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Few spoonfuls of rum or chablis. 

Dissolve the sugar in the water, hot; 
grate the rind of the lemon — the yellow 
part only — into a bowl, and squeeze in 
the juice and that of the orange and pour 
the hot syrup to them. liCt stand awhile, 
then strain into a freezer. Freeze, and 
when nearly finished whip the two whites 
and stir them in and beat up well. Add 
the rum, or the mixture of rum and wine, 
or the wine substitute for rum, at last. 
Serve in glasses. 



Cost of material- sugar 7, lemon and 
orange 4, white of eggs 3, rum ^ cupful 
6; 20 cents — ice and salt 15 — 35c fori 
quart or 8 to 12 glasses according to 
size. 



Note — Those who aim at making 
these punches as smooth and delicate as 
possible will put the 2 whites in a bowl 
and whip them in a cold place to a firm 
froth, then add two tablespoons cf pow- 
dered sugar and beat them together 
about one minute, making a smooth cake 
icing, and stir it into the punch when it 
is first frozen instead of the whipped 
whites without sugar. The difference is 
not very marked and those who are in 
baste will not care to stop to make the 
icing, still others insist upon its supe- 
riority. 

247~Klrsch Punch Rom^ine. 

2 cups water. 
1^ cups sagar. 

1 lemon — juice only. 

^ cup kirschwasset — small. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Mix the punch materials together cold, 
strain into the freezer. When nearly 
frozen whip the 2 whites firm, mix in 
and freeze again . 

Cost ef material — suf ar 7, lemon 2, 
eggs 3, kirschwasser 20; 32 cents — ice 
and salt 18 — 50c for 1 quart or 4 to 6c 
per glass according to size. 

248-^Maraschlno Punch— Romaine. 

2 cups water 

1 cup sugar. 

i a lemon — ^juice only. 
^ an orange — juice only.

2 whites of eggs. 

Mix all, except the whites, together 
cold, strain into a freezer, freeze as usu- 
al, whip the whites firm and stir in and 
beat up well and freeze again. It is a 
snow-white ice, rich and tenacious like 
pulled candy, The fruit juices are not 
essential, but an improvement. 



Cost of material — sugar 5, lemon and 
orange 4, eggs 3, maraschino 25, 37 
cents — ice andsalt 15 — 52c for 1 quart, 
or 6c each person.

Note — In counting ihe cost observe 
that the addition of white of eggs or 
meringue increases the bulk of the mate- 
rial iu tho freezer according to the de- 
gree to which it is beaten and a punch 
a la Homaine heaped in a glass like ice 
cream may cost less each person than a 
punch plam frozen of much less volume.

256~Fine Bakery Lunch 

There are some large establishments in 
the cities doing an immense business in 
serving lunches of breads, rolls, coflfee- 
cakes, pies, p-istries and cakes with cof- 
fee, tea,and milk and no meats beyond a 
small reserve of ham sandwiches. The 
lunches of this description are cheap but 
where the goods are fresh made and of 
tlic iiighest possible excellence and the 
fiurrouuuings clean the extraordinary 



numbers of customers that avail them- 
selves of it make the business one of 
great importance. Bread in every form 
is very cheap diet and cheapest of all 
when raised with yeast. The dough 
once made, a very considerable number 
of different articles such as raised cakes 
can be made from it easily. The first 
requisite is good yeast and as the com- 
pressed artide is not everywiiere to be 
obtained, it often becomes necessary for 
the baker to make his own, both stock 
and ferment. 



257— Stock Yeast, 

Boil a handful of hops in a quart of 
water about 30 minutes, strain the liquor 
and put it into a quart bottle. Let the 
bottle be only two-thirds full. When 
cool put in a handful of sugar and a 
handful of ground malt Cork and tie 
it down. Set the bottle in a moderately 
warm comer and let remain about 4^ 
hours. Then boil h pound of hops in a 
gallon of water. Put 4 cups flour in a 
pan, pour the boiling hop-water through 
a strainer on to it and mash to a sort of 
thin paste. When cool add 2 lieaping 
cups of ground malt and 1 of sugar then 
draw the cork of the bottle, mix in the 
contents set the stock away in a jar to 
ferment and in two days it will be ready 
for use. Strain it into a jug and keep it 
cold. It will keep good to start ferment 
with for a month or more. 



258— Commo n Yeast or Ferment. 

Stock yeast is not used to make bread 
with but to start ferment or common 
yeasc such as the bakers sell in most 
towns. 

Take about 24 potatoes, 

2 pounds of flour. 

4 ounces sugar. 

1 quart stock yeast* 

Wash the potatoes thoroughly, usin^ 
a brush for the purpose, and boil them in 
a ketJe of water. When done pour off 
what remains of the dark water and fill 
up again with fresh. When that boils 
torn out potatoes and boiling water on to

the flour in a large pan and mash all to a 
smooth paste. Throw i:i the sugar 
Thin down with ice water till hke thick 
cream. Set the large colander over your 
6-pallon stone jar (just fresh scalded out) 
and strain the yeast into it. When it is 
no more than about milk warm mix the 
stock or other yeast to start it. Let 
stand in a moderately warm place, un- 
disturbed, for from 12 to 24 hours— ac- 
cording to weather, activity, and need 
of using. It will then be ready for use, 
and should be kept cold. 

Cost of material — potatoes 4, flour 6, 
sugar 3, stock yeast or yeast cakes to 
start with 10; 23 cents for 4 gallons. 

Note — ^The dry hop yeast cakes an- 
swer very well to start the ferment above 
described if used plentifully — a whole 
package for 3 or 4 gallons — but are not 
equal to stock in making articles good 
and profitable to sell. Yeast also is sold 
and is a source of profit where the de 
mand is such that not much is left to 
throw away, for ferment will not keep 
long. The most of the cost is in the 
labor of making it 

259— Comm orTBr ead Dough. 

As a rule one-fourth yeast to three- 
fourths water. 

The good potato yeast with no germs 
of sourness in it, such aa we have already 
directed how to make, does no harm in 
still larger proportions when the weather 
is cold or time of mixing late. But 
the whitest bread is made when the 
dough can have long time to rise, not 
hurried up. 

1 pint yeast. 

3 pints warm water, 

1 heaping tablespoon salt. 

8 pounds flour. 

Makes 8 loaves of convenient size. 

Cost of raateinal — There are 12 pounds 
w^-ight of material which make about 10 
pounds of bread after baking and the 
cost per pound is according^ to the price 
of flour, with flour at 3J this small qnan- 
tity costs 3c per pound loaf. 



260— Cream Rolls. 

For about 60 split rolls. 

3 large cups milk. 
1 large cup yeast. 

1 ounce salt. (A heaping tablespoon.) 

2 ounces sugar. 

2 ounces lard or butter. 

4 pounds flour — 16 cups. 

Strain the yeast and the water into a 
pan and mix in half the flour. Beat the 
batter thus made thoroughly. Scrape 
down the sides of the pan. Pour a spoonful 
of melted lard on top and spread it with 
the back of the fingers. This is to 
prevent a crust from forming on top. 
Cover with a cloth and set the sponge in 
a moderately warm place to rise 4 or 5 
hours. 

This having been commenced at about 
8 in the morning beat it again about one, 
add the salt and make up stiff dough 
with the rest of the flour. Knead the 
dough on the table, alternately drawing 
it up in round shape and pressing the 
pulled-over edges into the middle and 
then pressing it out to a flat sheet, fold- 
ing over and pressing out again. 

Brush the clean scraped pan over with 
the least touch of melted lard or butter — 
which prevents sticking and waste of 
dough — place the dough in and brush 
that over, too. Where economy reigns 
the strictest a little warm water in a cup, 
and teaspoonful of lard melted in it will do 
for this brushing over and insures the 
truest saving and smoothest bread. Let 
the dough rise till 4. 

At about 4 o'clock spread the dough 
on the table by pressing out with the 
knuckles till it is a thin uneven sheet. 
Double it over on itself and press the 
two edges together all around first. This 
imprisons air in the knuckle holes in large 
masses. Then pound and press the 
dough with the fists till it has become a 
thin sheet again, with the inclosed air 
distributed in bubbles all through it. 
Fold over and repeat this process several 
times. Then roll it up. Let it stand a 
few minutes before making into rolls.

pull oflf pieces of dough of right size and 
mould them up instantly. Others cut off 
strips of dough, roll them in extended 
lengths and cut these up in roll sizes. 
Mould them up round with no flour on 
the board and only a dust on the hands, 
and place them in regular rows on the 
table — the smoothest side down. Take a 
little rolling pin — it looks like a piece of 
new broom handle — and roll a depression 
across the middle of each. Brush these 
over with the least possible melted lard 
or butter, using a tin-bound varnish 
brush for that purpose. Double the rolls, 
the two buttered sides together, and 
place them in the pans diagon «lly, with 
plentv of room so they will not touch. 
Brush over the tops of the rolls in the 
pans with the least possible melted lard 
again and set them to rise about an 
hour — less or more according to the tem- 
perature Bake in a hot oven, about 10 
minutes. Brush over with dear water 
when done. 



Cost of material — flour 14, yeast 3, 
milk 6, sugar 2, lard 6; 31 cents for 4 or 
5 dozen, according to size or 6c per doz- 
en. They sell 2 or 3 for 5c with a chip 
of butter added — about h oz, 1 cent. 



261— Graham Rolls. 



This is for fifty rolls of small size. 

2 pounds graham, not sifted. 

1 pound white flour. 

1 J pints warm water. 

j^ pint yeast 

J cup reboiled molasses — small 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

Set sponge with the graham at 9 or 
10 as directed for cream rolls, at about 
1 add all the rest of the ingredients and 
make it stiff dough. Let rise till 4. 
Then work the dough by spreading it 
out on the table, with the knuckles, 
folding over and pressing repeatedly. 
Make into little round balls slightly flat- 
tened, and if not plenty of room in the 
pans grease slightly between each one 
with a brush dipped in melted lard or 
butter. Brush over the tops with the 



same, and set the rolls to rise about 45 
minutes. Brash over with clear water 
on taking them from the ovea 

Cost of material — flour 10, yeast 3, 
molasses 3; 16 cents for 4 dozen or 4c 
per dozen — sold same as cream rolls. 



262— Coffee Cakes. 



2 pounds light dough. 

4 ounces sugar. 

4 ounces butter. 

4 yolks eggs 

Large half cup milk. 

Flour to make it soft dough. 

Take the piece of common bread 
dough, already light and fit to be made 
into a loaf, 6 hours before the coffee 
cakes are wanted to be baked, place it 
in a pan with the butter, sugar and milk. 
Let aU get warmed through and the but- 
ter softened, then mix them thoroughly. 
Next add the eggs and flour by littles, 
alternately, beating the mixture up 
against the side of the pan, to make it 
smooth and elastic. Spread the last 
handful of flour on the table, knead the 
dough as for rolls, pressing and spread- 
ing it out with the knuckles, and folding 
it over repeatedly. Set it in a warm 
place for 2 or 3 hours. Then knead it 
the second time. Every time the dough 
is doubled on itself the two edges shoidd 
be pressed together first When the 
dough is good and finished it looks silky, 
and air will snap from the edge when it 
is pinched. After this second kneading 
the dough should stand an hour and 
then be kneaded once more and made 
into shapes. The best shape is a twist 
made by taking as much dou^h as would 
make a cream roU — size of an egg be- 
fore raising, roll ib under the hands to a 
long rope, pinch the ends together and 
make a long twist Rise in the pans 1^ 
hours. Bake in a slow oven 15 min- 
utes. Brush over when done with 
sugar and water mixed, and flavored 
with vanilla, and dredge granulated su- 
gar over. If to be made overnight with- 
out light dough for a start, all the ingre-

dients can be mixed at once by taking 
a pint of yeast and a half pint of milk — 
or nearly all yeast — adding all the other 
articles and flour to make soft dough. 



Cost of material— dough 5, sugar 3,

24 cents for 30 cakes— sell at 2 for 6c 
with ^ oz butter. 



263— French Coffee Cakes. 



The plain coffee cakes described in the 
preceding receipt are the same that hotel 
pastry cooks call rusks. They are not 
80 easy to raise and bake perfectly as 
plain rolls, but where they are made in 
perfection and nicely brushed over with 
syrup wheu done they are extremely 
popular as a lunch with coffee or milk; 
but still more of a favorite is this variety, 
called French . The same dough answers ; 
the difference is in making out, as these 
have the dough brushed between with a 
very little melted lard and rolled up so 
that the cakes when baked will pull apart 
in flakes and strings. The same as in 
making split rolls. Wherever the butter 
touches, the roll will come apart after 
baking, these cakes having the whole 
sheet of dough slightly brushed over 
with lard or butter and folded upon itself 
without further kneading, will produce 
the layers and flakes in the cake. These 
are made in the shape of a large pretzel, 
raised, baked, brushed over with syrup 
and one, weighing about the same as one 
and a half of the others, served to an or- 
der. When a still richer kind is wanted 
use the following ingredients : 

1 pound light dough — 2 heaping cups. 

6 ounces butter — nearly a cup. 

4 tablespoons sugar. 

6 yolks and 1 whole egg: 
i cup milk. 

5 cups flour. 
Flavoring. 

If for ladies* luncheon or aftemoon tea 
take the dough from the breakfast rolls, 
and, six hours before the cakes or rusks 
will be wanted place it in a pan with the 
batter, sugar, and milk and proceed ac- 1 



cording to the directions given already 
for coffee cakes. The best flavoring to 
put in this dough is the grated rind of a 
lemon and half the juice. 

Cost of material for the richest vari- 
ety — dough 3, butter 10, sugar 3, eggs 
8, flour 3, milk and flavoring 3; 30 cents 
for 3 pounds or about 24 rusks, b ms, 
twists or coffee cakes, according to size. 

264 -Cheapest Coffee Cake. 



2 pounds light bread dough— 4 cups 
large. 

4 ounces sugar — J cup. 

4 ounces butter or lard — J cupt 

1 e^^, (Nt»t essential.) 

Take the dough at noon and mix in the 
ingredients all slightly warm. Knead it 
on the table with flour sufficent. Set to 
rise until 4 o'clock. Knead it again by 
fioreading it out on the table with the 
Ltmckles, folding over and repeating. 
Roll it out to sheets scarcely thicker 
thau a pencil, place on baking pans, 
brush over with either water or melted 
lard or milk. Rise about an hour. 
Score the cakes with a knife point as you 
put them in the oven to prevent the crust 
puffing up. Bake about 15 minutes. 

One of the attractions of this plain 
cake is the powdered cinnamon and su- 
gar sifted on top after baking, the cake 
being first brushed with sugar and water. 
Cut in squires if not baked in sheet 
cakes of right size for '^ale already. 

Cost of material— dough 5, sugar 4, 
lard 5, e^^^ flour, cinnamon, 4; 18 cents 
for 3 pounds— enough for 8 five cent 
sheets or 36 round plain buns. 

265— Stollen or Picnic Bread. 

IJ cups water or milk. 
-J cup yeast. 

1 teaspoon salt 

4 tablespoons sugar.

1 cup currants. 

Flour to make soft dough — 3 pounds. 

Set sponge same as for bread with part 
of the flour, yeast and water at 8 in the 
morning. At twelve make it up into 
dough and work in all the other ingre- 
dients. Let rise until 4. Work it oc 
the table, cut in G pieces, mould them 
up into round loaves, make a depression 
like a trough with the wrists along the 
middle, brush one side with butter and 
fold the two sides together like a large 
eplit roll of elongated shape. Rise an 
hour. Bake in a slack oven. Brush 
over with syrup when done. The same 
may be made by taking 4 or 5 cups of 
dough from the bread, already light and 
mixing the other ingredients in as for 
rusks and coffee cakes. 



Cost of material — dough 5, flour to 
work in 3, sug-ir 3, butter or lard 6, 
eggs 4, fruit and nutmeg 20; 41 cents, 
or 8c per pound. May be made in all 
sorts of shapes and baked in pans or 
molds to serve as a cheap sort of fruit 
cake. 



266— Cheapest Gingerbread, Yeast- 
Raised. 



4 cups light bread dough — 2 pounds. 

1 cup black molasses — 10 oz. 

1 cup, small, lard or butter — 6 osi 

1 heaping teaspoon ground ginger. 

Flour to make it soft dough. 

An Q^^ improves it but is not essen- 
tial. 

Work the ingredients all together 
at about si^ hours before baking time. 
Let rise 4 hours, knead it on the table, 
taking care the molasses in the dough 
does not cause you to take in too much 
flour and make the cake tough. Roll it 
out in sheets, tike up on the rolling pin 
and unroll on the baking pans. Brush 
over the top with water that has a little 
melted 1 ird in it. Rise in the pans about 
an hour, bake 20 minutes. Brush over 
with syrup. Cut in square blocks for 
sale. 



Cost of material— dough 5, molasses 
3, lard 8, ginger 2, flour 3; 21 cents for 
4 pounds. Size of cakes according to 
lightess. Usually cut into 12 five cent 
blocks. 

267— Currant Buns. 



No eggs required. Favorite sort and 
quickly made. This makes 20. 

4 cups light dough — 2 pounds. 

1 small cup currants. 

^ cup softened butter. 

\ cup sugar. 

It is soon enough to begin these 2 
hours before baking time or before sup- 
per. Take the dough from the rolls say 
at 4 o'clock. Spread it out, strew the 
currants over and knead them in. Roll 
out the dough to J inch sheet. Spread 
the butter evenly over it and the sugar 
en top of that. Cut in bands about as 
wide ap your hand. Roll them up like 
roly-poly puddings. Brush these long 
rolls all over slightly with a little melted 
lard so that the buns will not stick to- 
gether in the pans. Then cut off in 
pieces about an inch thick. Place fiat in 
a buttered pan,touching but not crowded. 
Rise nearly an hour, Bake 15 minutes. 
Brush oxer with sugar and water. 
Dredge sugar and cinn mon over. 

Cost of material — dough 5, currants 
3, butter 8, sugar and cinnamon 4; 20 
cents or 1 cent each. 



268 — Cinnamon Buns. 



The same as the preceding with the 
currants left out, and some ground cin- 
namon mixed with sugar that is spread 
over the sheet of dough instead. Thb 
buns can be uncoiled after baking on ac- 
count of the butter being rolled up in 
them. 



269— Plain Doughnuts. 

4 cups light bread dough — 2 lbs. 

^ cup sugar. 

2 ounces melted lard. 

Lard to fry. 



82 



SAK FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



Take the dough from the breakfast 
rolls, say at 9 in the morning, in Winter. 
In Summer the dough worked up at 
mid-day will do. Mix in the ingredients, 
let stand half an hour Work up stiff 
with flour suflScient, and set to rise about 
4 hours. Then knead, apd roll it out to a 
sheet Brush over the whole sheet of 
dough with a very little melted lird. 

Cut out with a large biscuit cutler and 
cut the middle out with a small one. 
This makes rings, which must be set to 
rise on greased pans about J hour, then 
dropped in hot lard. Sift sugar over 
when done. They cook m about 5 min- 
utes. 



Cost of material — dough 5, sugar and 
lard 5, lard to fry 8; 18 cents for about 
24. 

270— Bread Doughnuts. 

Only plain dough, or French roll 
dough. Cut out biscuit shapes, let rise, 
and fry. These are very often found at 
railroad lunch stands ; nearly as cheap as 
bread and butter, and very saleable. 

271— Bismarcks. 

bort of doughnut with stewed fruit in- 
side. 

4 cups light dough — 2 pounds. 

1 bastingspoon molasses. 

1 bastingspoon sugar. 

1 egg. 

1 baatingspoon melted lard. 

^ cup Ptewed apple or other fruit . 

Lard to fry. 

Put the light dough in a pan with all 
the other ingredients except the fruit, 
and work them together, and let stand 
■J hour. Then add flour sufficient to 
make a soft dough of it and set it to rise 
about 4 hours. Then roll it out to a 
very thin sheet and brush over with 
water. Put a teaspoonful of fruit at the 
right distances apart on one half of it, 
fold the other half over and cut with a 
large biscuit cutter so that the inclosed 
spots of fruit will be in the middle. Rise 



on pans like rolls nearly an hour, then 
drop in hot lard and fry to a fine brown 
color. 

Cost of material — dough 5, molasses 
and sugar 3, egg 2, stewed fruit 3, 
flour 2; lard to fry 8; 23 cents for 20. 

jq"oTE — The mixture of molasses and 
sugar makes a better color on the dough- 
nut than sugar alone. Always, when 
making any kind of fried cake take care 
to have the sugar dissolved before it goes 
into the flour, for mixing dry sugar in is 
one of the main causes of such things 
soaking up grease. It is an improvement 
to dredge them with powdered sugar 
when done. 

272— Fried Pies. 



A very good and saleable sort is pre- 
cisely like Bismarcks except the shape. 
Cut out large flats, wet the edge, put a 
spoonful of fruit in the middle and double 
the sido over like any other sort of turn- 
over. Rise an hour and fry. Another 
sort of fried pie is made of common cov- 
ered pie paste, in shape like a turnover, 
with a little fruit inside. Close the edges 
well Fry as soon as made, light col- 
ored, in hot lard. The others are a kind 
of fried bread and light. These are fried 
pie paste, yelU>w and crisp. 

273— Sco tch Se ed Cake. 

Takes five hours time to make, raise, 
and bake, using dough to begin with. 

2 pounds light-bread dough — 5 cnpa. 

12 ounces sugar — IJ cups. 

12 ounces of butter — 1 J cups. 

4 eggs. 

1 teaspoon caraway seeds. 

8 ounces flour — 2 cups. 

Weigh out the dough at 7 in the morn- 
ing. Set it with the butter and sugar in 
a warm place. At about 9 work all 
together and beat in the eggs one at a 
time, and add the carraway. Give it 
another half hour to stand and become 
smooth, then add the flour and give the 
who^e ten minutes beating. It makes a 
stiff batter — not dough.

Put it ia two buttered cake moulcls. 
Kise about an hour. It should not be 
too light, bake as you would bread, in a 
slack oven, less than an hour. 

Cost of material — dough 5, sugar, 
seeds, and flour 10 butter 24, eggs 9; 
48 cents for nearly 4 pounds or two 
2- quart molds, or 12c per pound. 

Note — These raised cakes are like 
fresh bread, cannot be sliced till a day or 
two old without waste. 



274— Sc otch Te a Cakes. 

2 pounds light-bread dough. 

8 ounces sugar. 

8 ounces lard. 

1 teaspoonful carraway seeds. 

1 pound flour. 

The difference between this and the 
preceeding kind is that this makes a soft 
dough, to be handled and kneaded like 
bread. It is less rich and requires no 
eggs . Make it up the same way or like 
the cheapest coffee cake and let rise in 
thin cakes on jelly cake pans. Brush 
over v/ith melted lard when setting to 
rise. Score the tops with a knife point 
when they are light and bake about 15 
minutes. If for sale bru'^h over with 
syrup and dredge with sugar. 

Cost of material — 25 cents for nearly 
4 pounds— equal to about 3 dozen buns 
or G jelly-sheet cakes to cut. Good hot 
for supper. 

275— New England Cake. 

Make the Scotch seed cake but with 1 
pound of seeded or seedless raisins and 
half cupful of brandy and flavorings, and 
omit the carrawav seeds. 



276— Yeast-Raised Plum Cake. 

The slowest to rise. Use the liveli- 
est dough, and in winter it had better 
be saved over night and mixed up with 
the mam part ot the ingredients; add the 
fruit next morning, and bake after din- 
ner. 



2 pounds light bread dough. 

1 pound black molasses and sugar, 
mixed. 

1 pound butter. 

6 eggs. 

12 ounces flour. 

1 ounce mixed ground spices. 

1^ pounds seedless raisins. 

1 pound currants. 

8 ounces citron. 

Brandy, and lemon extract. 

Warm the dough and all the ingre- 
dients slightly. 5fix well, except the 
fruit and brandy. Beat the batter, and 
set to rise in the mixing pan about 3 
hours. Beat again and add the fruit, 
previously floured. Line the moulds 
with battered paper, half fill and set to 
rise again about '2 hours. Bake from 
one hour to two, according to size. Large 
cakes should have a coating of paper tied 
outside the moulds to protect the crust 
during the two hours baking. 

These cakes should not be turned out 
of the moulds till at least one day old. 

Cost of material — dough 5, molasses 
and sugar II, butter 30, eggs 12, flour 
and spices 8, raisins 30, currants 10, 
citron 20, brandy and extract 12; $1, 38 
for about 8 pounds or two 2-quart moulds, 
or about 18c per pound. 

Note — AH of the foregoing articles 
are made lijrht with yeast and all are 
made by taking a piece of dough that is 
already light either from the family bread 
pan or bakera trough. A very good sort 
of apple dumpling is cheaply made in the 
same way of the same dough as for 
doughnuts, the dumplings allowed to 
remain in the pans long enough for the 
dough to become light before baking. 
The dumplings like the doughnuts and 
all other varieties must have a slight 
brushing over of melted lard to prevent 
a era St forming on them and cracking 
open while set away to rise. 

277— Rusks. 



These are slices of various sorts of cake 
dried in the oven something like dry toast 



84 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



The coffee cakes previously described, if 
baked in loaves and sliced when stale 
make the best of r asks and for this reason 
perhaps, have gained the name of rasks 
when hot and in fancy shapes. But the 
name is not correct. They are then cakes 
or buns. The following are special 
Borts : 



278— Marlborough Rusks. 



Make the common sponge cake — called 
eight-egg sponge cake in the index — and 
add to the mixture along with the flour 
one ounce carraway seeds . Bake m long 
narrow moulds. When a day old, slice 
and brown the slices in the oven. These 
crisped slices can be kept a long time, 
and serve much the same purpose as 
sweet crackers. 



Cost of material — 32 cents for 32 
dices, or according to size. 

279— Anisette Rusks. 

8 ounces granulated sugar — 1 cup, 

10 eggs. 

4 ounces almonds. 

6 ounces flour. 

\ ounce anise seed. 

Mince the almonds as fine as possible, 
without removing the skins. ]\Iix them 
and the anise bced with the flour dry. 
Beat the sugar and egg;s together about 
20 minutes or until quite light, as if for 
sponge cake, and lightly stir in the flour 
etc Bake in long and narrow moulds and 
when a day old slice and brown the 
slices on both sides in the oven. 

Cost of material — 39 cents. 

280— Russian Wine Rusks. 

Make with the s. me care in beating 
the eggs and cutting in the flour lightly 
that IS needed to make sponge cake 
good. 

14 ounces granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

8 ounces almonds. 

8 oinces graham flour. 



1 teaspoon almond extract. 

Crush the almonds with the rolling- 
pin on the table without removing the 
skins, and then mix them with the gra- 
ham flour,which should have the coarsest 
bran sifted away before weighing. Beat 
the sugar and eggs together in a cool 
place about 20 minutes or until light and 
thick. Stir in the flavoring and flour 
and almonds. Bake in long, narrow 
molds and when a day old slice and 
brown the slices in the oven. 

Cost of material — sugar 10, eggs 25, 
almonds 20, flour 2, extract 1; 58 cents 
for 2 J pounds. 

Note. — Rusks of the preceding sorts 
may be seen in the windows of many of 
the best confectioneries. They are as 
expensive as cakes and are sold accor- 
dingly. 

The way of mixing the sponge cake 
batter for the two foregoing is for one 
person working alone. The eggs and 
sugar can be made perfectly light by 
sufficient beating. If it is preferred to 
separate the eggs and have the whites 
and yolks and sugar beaten separately 
by two persons, observe to mix in the 
whipped whites last of all, after the flour 
and all else. 



281— Sponge Cake Squares. 

14 ounces sugar — 2 cups. 

8 eggs. 

1 cup water. 

18 ounces flour — 4 rounded cups. 

1 heaping teaspoon baking powder. 

Separate the eggs, put the sugar and 
water with the yolks and beat up until 
light and thick. Mix the powder with 
the flour. Whip up the whites. Stir 
the flour into the yolk mixture and then 
the whites. As soon as they are fairly 
mixed in out of sight it is ready. Spread 
it -h inch deep in a greased baking pan. 
Dredge a very little powdered sugar 
over the surface and bake about 10 min- 
utes. When cold cut it into 10 or 12 
square blocks. 

Cost of material — 30c;

beat up with the egrg whisk. The mix- 
ture is thin like batter cakes. Make 
deep gem pans hot without greaeing 
them, eo that they hiss when the batter 
is poured in then there will not be any 
black marks on the rolls. Bake about 
15 or 20 minutes. 



Cost of material — 12 cents for 24 to

J cup milk or water. 

1 large teaspoon baking powder. 
Flour to roll out, or about 4 cups.

2 whites of egg^s. 

4 ounces desiccated cocoanut. 
Little lemon extract. 

Stir the sugar and whites together in 
a small bowl rapidly for about 5 mm- 
utes. Add the extract and the cocoa- 
nut. When mixed placo it in cords 
across the sheet of cake and bake again 
in a slack oven until the macaroon on 
top has a light brown color Place fruit 
jelly in the hollows between the ridges. 

Cost of material — 43 cents plain —

pounds. Cut in 18 or 20 squares. 

288— Boston Cream Puffs or Cream 
Cakes. 



Common in the baker's shops, consist- 
ing of two parts, the hollow shell made 



with a cooked paste not sweetened and a 
thick custard for filling. This makes 
about 20. 

J pint water — 1 cup. 

4 ounces lard or butter — J-cup, 

4 ounces flour — 1 cup. 

5 eggs. 

Little salt when lard is used. 

Set the water on to boil with the lard 
in it. Put in the flour dry as it Is and 
all at once, and stir the mixture over the 
fire about five minutes or until it has be- 
come a smooth, well cooked paste. Take 
it off and add the eggs one at a time and 
beat in each one well before adding the 
next. Give the paste a thorough beat- 
ing against the side of the pan for finish. 

Drop portions size of an egg on ba- 
king pans very slightly greased and 
bake in a moderate oven about 20 mm- 
utes. Let the puffs bake slowly at last 
and dry so they will not fall when taken 
out. Cut a slit, in the side and fill with 
pastry cream by means of a teaspoon 



Note. — The eggs must be added to the 
cooked paste before it becomes cold, oth- 
erwise they will be a failure. It is bet- 
ter to use light weight of shortening and 
full weight of flour, than to risk disap- 
pointment by making them too short to 
retain their hollow form. 

It will be found when the first pan of 
puffs do not rise perfectly that the paste 
can be much improved by more beating. 
Make them small for profit but large for 
show if you want to please the party.

milk and beat rapidly with an egg wbisk. 
When it has thickened add the eggs and 
let cook elowly at back of the range 
about 10 minutes longer. Flavor when 
cool. 

The foregoing quantity is right for fill- 
ing the 20 puffs of the preceding receipt. 

Cost of cream puffs — eggs 14, butter 
8, sugar 3, extract 3, flour 2; 30 cents 
for from 15 to 25 according to size. 
Large ones sell at 5c each. 

290— Corn Starch Cream Puffs. 



Lightest thinest shells and in other re- 
spects the finest. 
1 cup milk — J pint. 
J cup butter— 3 ounces. 

4 heaping tablespoons starch — ^four 
ounces. 

5 eggs. 

Boil half the milk with the butter 
in it. Mix the starch free from lumps 
with the other half. Pour both together 
and let cook to a smooth paste. Add 
the eggs one at a time after removing it 
from the fire — and beat thoroughly. 
Drop spoonfuls size of guinea eggs on 
baking pans very slightly greased and 
bake in a moderate oven about 20 min- 
utes. This makes 20 to 25. Fill with 
the following: 

291— Corn Starch Pastry Cream. 



1 cup water or m'lk — J pint. 

3 tablespoons sugar — 3 ounces. 

1 heaping tablespoon starch — 1 ounce. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

1 egfif, (2 yolks are better.) 

Lemon or vanilla flavoring. 

Boil the water or milk with the sugar 
in it Mix the starch with a little water 
extra; pour it in the saucepan and stir 
up. Then before it has boiled again, 
add the egg and butter and stir until 
the mixture becomes quite thick — per- 
haps ten minutes. Flavor when cool. 
Fill the puff with it by means of a tea- 
spoon, the pu£& being cut open at the 
side. 



Note — ^The preceding kind of pastry 
cream makes a good lemon cream pie if 
a small lemon is added to it. Grate the 
rind and squeeze in the juice. 

Cost of com starch puffs and cream 
filling— 27 cents for 20 to 25. 

292— Transparent Puffs. 

1 cup water — J pint. 

Butter size of an egg — 1^ ounces. 
3 tablespoons starch — 3 ounces. 

2 whole eggs and 3 whites. 

Make the same way as other cream 
puffs. The use ot them is to make puffs 
different from other peoples and for the 
tollowing sort. 

293— Cocoanut Eclairs' 



Make 20 cream puffs of either of the 
three mixtures above directed and take 
care not to have the paste too soft through 
the eggs being very large or the flour 
scant, as these should rise round and 
hollow, and not run out wide on the 
pans. 

When baked have some grated cocoa- 
nut mixed with graaulated sugar ready 
on a dish and roll the puffs in it, giving 
a good coating. Set them in a warm 
place to dry. If you use desiccated 
cocoanut, mix it with syrup hot. 

294— Cream Puff Tarts. 



Line 20 common patty pans with a 
very thin bottom of good pie paele or 
sweet tart paste and pnt in each one a 
spoonful of cream puff mixture — the 
same as for Boston cream puffs — spread 
it evenly, then bake about 20 minutes. 
Have some syrup ready and brush over 
the tops and dredge with either cocoa- 
nut or chopped almonds. They are risen 
high and hollow like cream pufife in the 
baking and this surf ice dredging is to 
be done while they are hot. After that 
raise one end with the point of a knife 
and insert a teaspoonful of any kind of 
pastry cream. 



Cost of material — about 2 cents each.

295— Chocolate Pastry Cream. 

2 caps milk — 1 pint. 

^ cup sugar — 4 ounces. 

2 heaping tablespoons flour — 2 ounces. 

•J cup grated chocolate — 1 ounce. 

Butter size guinea egg — 1 ounce. 

1 egg (2 yolks are better). 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Boil the milk, butter and grated choc- 
olate together, stirring with an egg-beater 
to prevent buraing. Mix sugar and 
flour together diy in a pan and when well 
mingled beat them into the boiling milk, 
then set the saucepan on the side of the 
range. Mix the yolks well with a spoon- 
ful of milk, add them to the other and 
let cook until well thickened. Flavor 
with vanilla when cold. Use it to fill 
chocolate cream puffs same way as plain 
pastry custard. 

Cost of material — 13 cents for 
cnpfnls. 

Note — The foregoing chocolate cream 
makes excellent cream pies or tarts, the 
pie crust to be baked first then the filling 
put in and frosting over the top. The 
common unsweetened chocolate is in- 
tended. When the sweet chocolate is 
used a larger proportion will be needed. 

296— Ch ocolate Eclairs. 

Bake cream puff's in long or ovel 
shape, put in a small amount of cream 
filling, then dip the tops in a chocolate 
icing* made of 

1 cup sugar. 

4 tablespoons water. 

2 ounces common chocolate. 

Grate the chocolate and set it on with 
the sugar and water to melt gradually in 
a place not hot enough t » bnra it. When 
it has at lengrth become boilinj^ hot beat 
it to thoro\ighly mix, nnd dip in the ar- 
ticles to be glazed while it is hot. May 
be used also to spread up<jn cakes. 

297— French Ceam Puffs. 

All three of the puff" mixtures preced- 
ing are unsweetened and cook light 



colored ; this contains a little sugar and 
is consequently easy to bum. 

1 cup water — J pint. 

J cup butter — 3^ ounces. 

2 tablespoons sugar — IJ ounces. 
1 cup flour — 5 ounces. 

3 eggs. 

1 teaspoon extract vaniUa. 

Boil the water with the butter and 
sugar in it, in a deep bowl-shaped sauce- 
pan large enough to finish the paste in. 
Put in the flour all at once and stir until 
you have a stiff, smooth paste, or about 
5 minutes. Take it from the fire, drop 
in one egg at a time and boat it in thor- 
oughly before adding another. When 
all are in give the paste a very thorough 
beating against the side of the saucepan. 
Drop pieces in either round or egg shapes 
on a baking pan very slightly greased. 
Bake them about 20 minutes in a mode- 
rate oven. They rise rounded and hol- 
low. Cut a slit in the side and fill with 
my sort of pastry cream or with fruit 

je% 

298— Coffee Pastry Cream. 



1 cup clear very strong coffee. 

1 cup cream. 

^ cup sugar — 4 ounces, 
J cup flour — 2 ounces. 

2 eggs — (4 yolks make it better.) 

Set the coffee and cream on to boil. 
Mix the sugar and flour together dry 
then drop them into the boiling liquid 
and beat up rapidly with an egg beater, 
(This is the quickest and easiest way of 
thickening all flour custards and pudding 
sauces). When it has thickened add 
the eggs slightly beaten and cook 5 min- 
utes more. Use to fill cream puffs or 
cakes or tarts, or make coffee cream pie 
with frosting on top. 



Cost of French cream puffs — the paste 
16, coffee pastry cream 16; 32 cents for 
16. With jelly for filling about the same. 
Large puffs sell 5c each. May be 
brushed over the top with sugar slightly 
wetted, and then dried.

299— Cream Cake or Washington Pie. 

Consists of two layers of cako with 
pasiry cream spread between — ^like jelly 
cake — and either powdered sugar or plain 
icing on top. For the cake take 

1 cup sugar — 8 ounces. 
5 eggs. 

J cup butter — 4 ounces. 

^ cup water — large measure. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 

3 cups flour. 

Put the sugar, eggs and water into a 
pan and beat them together a minute or 
two. Have the butter melted and stir 
it in, then the powder and flour. Beat 
all well together. Bake thinly spread on 
jelly cake pans or on a large baking pan 
to cut in squares. There are cheaper 
mixtures that can be used for the same 
purpose but this if well made with suffi- 
cient powder rises very light and makes 
a large amount. Spread the same pastry 
cream between that is directed for cream 
puffs. 

Cost of material — cake 26, pastry 
cream 13 39 cents. 



300— Napoleon Cake. 

Consists of two layers of puff paste 
baked separately, pastry cream spread 
upon one the other placed on top, and 
icing sugar slightly wetted spread upon 
that. 

Make puff paste with three quarters of 
a pound of butter to a pound of flour. 
Roll it and fold it only 6 times instead 
of 7 as for tarts. Cut in two, roll out 
thin, place the sheets of paste on two 
baking pans and after baking light col- 
ored place one on the other prepared as 
above directed. The com starch pastry 
cream may be used. The glaze for the 
top is the same as pearl glaze for angel 
food. Cut in squares when finij?hed. 

Cost of material — puff paste 24, pas- 
try cream 13, glace 3; 40 cents, or same 
as Washington pie. Can be cut in 8 or 
10 ten-cent squares, according to light- 
ness. 



Note — In order to handle sheets of 
puff paste without breaking: it is neces- 
sary to roll up the raw paste on the 
rolling-pin and unroll it on the pan it is 
to be baked on, never touching it with 
the hands. Take up the sheet of paste 
after baking by sliding two broad knives 
under, or paddles made of shingles. 

301— Saratoga Cake. 

Bake two sheets of puff paste the same 
as for Napoleon cake. Spread fruit jelly, 
preserves or some good fruit stewed 
down rich upon one sheet, place the oth- 
er sheet on top and cover that with frost- 
ing, the same as for lemon pies. Cut in 
squares. 

Cost of material — about 40c, or ac- 
cording to kind of jelly or jam used. 

302— Florentine Pastry. 

Consists of a bottom crust of rich pie 
paste in a broad baking pan with jam or 
good fruit stewed down with sugar, 
baked in it, and a covering of frosting 
the same as for lemon pie <t strawberry 
meringue well sprinkled over with shred 
almonds and slightly baked. 

303— English Fruit Pies. 

These sell well at the bakeries . Take 
deep dishes such as are used to dish up 
vegetables in at dinner, but about 6 or 
7 inch size, nearly fill with any kind of 
berries in season, cover with sufficient 
sugar and put on a thin top crust of good 
short paste. Cut around the edges, 
make a small hole in the middle of the 
lid. Bake about 15 minutes. There is 
no bottom crust and all the fruit juice is 
retained in full flavor. 

Cost of material — crust each IJ 
cents, berries average including straw- 
berries 4c. Sell at 10c each. 



304— Iced Coffee. 

Served in a tall glass like lemonade, 
with two straws and shaved ice in it. . 
For a single glass take 
2 large teaspoons powdered sugar. 



90 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



4 tablespoons rich milk. 

A small cap coffee. 

Some shaved ice. 

Shake up with a tin punch mixer over 
the glass (bar-keepers fashion) and serve 
with the foam on top. The foaming ap- 
pearance may be increased by one raw 
egg to a pint beaten up in the milk that 
is used, and gives it a cream color. 

Cost of material — 2 cents per glass. 



OYSTER BAY. 



305— Raw Oysters— Half Shell. 

Open the oysters as they are called 
for, loosen trom the shell, serve in the 
best shell with as much of their own 
liquor as can be saved, ranged on a plate 
with half a lemon in the center. Shred 
cabbage, crackers, butter and table sau- 
ces go free. 

306— Raw Oysters— Bulk. 

''Counts'* are the largest— same thing 
as "Saddle Rocks." "Selects" next lar- 
gest. Serve a dozen on the plate. Lem- 
on, if called for, in a small glass dish at 
the side. 

Cost — ^accord mg to the price of oys- 
ters — with oysters 'at $1,00 per 100 — 
oysters 12, lemon J, crackers 1, butter 
2, tomato ketchup etc., IJ; 17 cents a 
dozen. Small oysters only half the 
price. 

307— Oyster Stei 

It is a dozen medium oysters with a 
pint or less of milk and perhaps a small 
allowance of butter; with crackers, but- 
ter and pickles on the table. Cook the 
oysters and milk in separate saucepans. 
Dip the oysters from the saucepan into 



the bowl, add a ladleful of milk and a 
small piece of fresh butter. Serve crack- 
ers, butter and shred cabbage separately 
with the stew. 



Cost of material — oysters 7, milk 3, 
table extras 4; 14 cents. 

Note — Oysters do not always cu'-dle 
the milk when boiled in it, but there is 
always a danger that they may, so the 
rule is not to run any risk. Besides, to 
cook the oysters in the milk although 
good for flavor, always makes a dingy 
looking stew with a scum on top. To 
obtain the best quality and appearance 
boil some oyster liquor separately and 
keep it ready for orders, Aa it reaches 
boiling point the scum on top can be 
skimmed off and after that pour it 
through a fine strainer into a clean sauce- 
pan, and you have the oyster essence 
clear and ready for use without detri- 
ment to the appearances. 

308— Plain Stew. 



The oysters cooked as above with 
the liquor only served with them, and 
no milk. 



Note — It is with cooking an oyster as 
with cooking an egg. It may be either 
soft boiled or hard boiled, only there 
is a difference that an oyster boiled hard 
is spoiled. To cook oysters for stews 
set some of the liquor that has been pre- 
viously boiled and strained as directed 
above, on the lange in a little saucepan 
and drop in the oysters with a fork. Add 
a pinch of salt and pepper, shake them 
back and forth while heating and as soon 
as the liquor fairiy boils they are done. 
Time about 3 minutes for one stew. 



309— Dry Stew. 



The same as plain stew but served 
without the liquor. Have a spoonful of 
fresh butter ready melted at a conven- 
ient place and pour it to the oysters in 
the bowl after they have been dipped up 
out of their liquor with a strainer.

310— Boston Fancy Stew. 

Make a milk stew in the same style, 
and a thin slice of battered toast Use 
a broad and shallow bowl. Put the 
buttered toast in the bowl, dish the oys- 
ters (soft cooked) on the toast and pour 
the liquor in at the side, enough to make 
it float. 



Cost of material — 12 large oysters 12, 
milk 4, buttered toast 1, table extras 3; 
20 cents. 



311— Box Stew. 



The richest stew that can be made 
and with the very largest oysters, called 
Fulton Market box oysters. 

Prepare a square of buttered toast the 
same as for Boston fancy and put it 
in a hot bowl. Take a bastingspoon of 
cream and put it into a bastingspoon of 
dear oyster liquor that has been boiled 
before, and add an ounce of best butler. 
Cook the oysters in another saucepaiL 
When soft done dish them on the toast 
in the bowl and pour the cream liquor 
around. 



Cost of material — 12 extra fine oys- 
ters 24, cream 2, butter and toast 4, 
table extras, lemon etc., 5; 35 cents. 
Sells at 60 cents. 



312— Oysters Sawteed In Butter. 

Not necessary to use eggs. Drop the 
oysters into a plate of cracker meal and 
give them a good coating. Be careful not 
to rub it oflP as it will not stick a second 
time Drop an ounce of butter in the 
frying pan, and when melted lay in the 
oysters close together. Cook over a 
brisk fire to get brown on one side with- 
out hardening them. Lay a small plate 
upside down on the oysters, turn over 
the pan, then slide the cake of oysters 
from the plate into the pan again without 
letting them break apart, and brown the 
other side. Serve on the plate set in 
another plate. Ornament with lemon 
and parsley. There are oval shaped 



pans for such saviees as this, to be in 
shape for a platter. 

Cost of material — 12 medium oysters 
7, butter 2, cracker meal 1, lemon and 
parsley garnish 1, table extras 4, 15 
cents. 

313— Fried Oys ters. S ingle Breaded« 

Dry the oysters by pressing with a 
napkin. Drop them into beaten egg, in 
which is a little salt, and out of that 
into craker meal. Give them a good 
coating by pressing, with care not to 
rub, or leave a bare place for the grease 
to get in. Drop them singly into a fry- 
ing pan of hot lard . Fry brown in 2 or 
3 minutes. Dish neatly in tbe middle 
of a hot platter with a piece of lemon 
and sprigs of parsley 

Cost of material — oysters 12, eggs 3, 
meal 1, lard to fry 2, lemon and parsley 
garnish 1, table extras 4; 23 cents. 

Note — The way of frying oysters suc- 
cessfully without the use of eggs has been 
fully explained in a former receipt. It 
needs more care than when eggs are used, 
but may effect a great saving in the 
season when eggs are dearest. Even 
with that fried oysters are expensive 
over the other methods of cooking be- 
cause of the lard destroyed. At the 
end of a meal the craker sediment wiU 
have made the lard used dark and unfit 
for further use, and if clarified of that 
there still remains a sort of mucilage 
from the oysters that makes the lard boil 
over like butter melting, and almost use- 
less. Consequently the charge for fries 
is, and has to be, higher than for other 
styles. 

314 — Fried Oyst ers. D ouble Breaded 

Out of their own liquor into cracker- 
meal, coat well, dip in beaten eg^ and* 
then in cracker-meal again. Fry 4 or 
5 minutes. Oysters look twice as large 
as they really are, when double breaded. 

Cost. — ^They take up more e^^ but 
the expense is made up in the apparent

increase in the size, and when they are 
carefully cooked of a light color and 
crisp the double breading ia preferred by 
most customers. 



315— Broiled Oysters, Bread-Crumbed 



The original meaning of breading has 
nearly been forgotten, so much better for 
most purposes is the meal of crushed and 
sifted crackers than grated dry bread. 
But the Bmallness of the demand for 
breaded oysters broiled — a way that over 
the w iter is considered most delicate — is 
procf that cracker-meal is not the thing 
for it. 

Oysters breaded in cracker-meal, then 
broiled, unless they are deluged with 
butter, are more like discolored pieces of 
buckskin than anything eatable. 

Grate a stale loaf of bread or else 
mince the thin slices extremely fine with 
a knife. Shake the oysters about in a 
little beaten egg, dip them in the bread 
crumbs and gently press a coating on 
Kith sides. It is better to let them lie 
in the crumbs awhile if there is time . 

Brush the wire oyster broiler with a 
brush dipped in butter,place the oysters, 
shut down the other side and as soon as 
the egg is set with the heat of the bright 
coals baste the oysters on both sides 
with the same brush in butter. Get a 
toast-brown on both sides without cook- 
ing the oysters too much. Serve on a 
dish the same as tried oysters, with a 
piece of lemon. 



Cost of material— oysters 12, bread 
1, egg 2, butter 3, table extras 4: 22 
cents. 

Note. — Where silver-plated griddles 
and sdver wire broilers are used it is 

Practicable to dispense with the butter 
, asting altogether, and prevent sticking 
by rubbing the bars with chalk Some 
of the greatest re«^tauranis of the two 
continents have had a sort of specialty 
in this line, and probably proved not 
only the desirableness but the real econ- 
omy of the mode. 



316— -Plain Broiled Oysters on Toast. 



Take ihe largest oysters >btainable. 
Brush the wire oyster broiler with soft- 
ened butter, lay in the oysters and broil 
over a hot fire 2 or 3 minutes, basting 
once on each side with the butter brush. 
Dish side by side on one long slice of 
buttered toast in a dish. Garnish with 
lemon and parsley. 

Cost. — Largest oysters one dozen 
24, butter 2, toast 1, garnish 3, table 
extras 6; 35 cents — Sells at 50c, or ac- 
cording to grade of oysters. There is 
no satisfaction in plain broiling small 
oysters. 

317— Oysters Broiled in Bacon. 



Dredge some large oysters with pep- 
per and squeeze the juice of a lemon 
over them. 

Cut large slices of fat bacon as thin as 
possible . Roll up two oysters together 
in each slice, run a skewer through diag- 
onally and put six such rolls on each 
skewer crowded together to allow for 
shrinkage. Bake in the top of the oven 
for a few minutes, the skewers resting 
on the edge of a pan with the oysters 
raised above the drippings. Finish on 
the broiler. Serve on the skewers on 
buttered toast in a dieh, and if common 
skewers are used slip a ring of fringed 
paper on the end. 

Cost of material — 12 large oysters 
15, lib bacon 15, toast 2, lemon 2, table 
extras and potatoes 6; 40 cents. 



318— Steamed Oysters. Shells, 



Scrub the oysters clean in water. 
Place the deep shell side down in the 
steamer and steam them about 5 min- 
utes. Take off the top shell and save 
as much of the liquor as possible with 
the oyster in ihe lower one. Serve on a 
platter without seasoning or any addition, 
except lemon in quarters.

319~0yst ers— Sh eli Roast. 

A bright and glowing charcoal fire is 
requisite for this. The oyster ranges 
are nearly all broiler and the bars are 
near the coals. Scrub the dirt from the 
ehells of the oysiers before cooking, with 
a brush in water. Lay them on the 
broiler, flat side down, and endeavor to 
get the shell so hot as to slightljr color 
the oyster. When the shell begins to 
open turn it over. Dish up in the deep 
shell, the other removed entirely, and if 
too dry pour over each one a small spoon- 
ful of hot oyster liquor and butter mixed. 
Serve a dozen on a platter, a half on a 
fish plate, with lemon. 

Cost — 12 oysters 12, lemon 1, ta »le 
extras 4; 17 cents. 

320— Oyste rs— F ancy Roast. 

Cut two slices of butterea toast to fit 
a medium sized platter, when placed end 
to end, or cut fancy shapes of toast that 
when placed together will form a star 
shape, 

Roast the oysters in the shells. Take 
them oHt when done and place them on 
the toast and pour some hot oyster liquor 
mixed with cream over the toast in the 
dish. Garnish with parsley. 

Cost — oysters 12, toast 2, cream 2, 
table extras and garnishing 4; 20 cents. 

3?1— Oysters— Pan Roast. 

An imitation of the shell roast. 

1. Put 12 or 13 oysters in a bright 
pie pan, with their liquor. Dredge with 
salt and pepper very sparingly. Drop 
in some small lumps of butter and bake 
on the top shelf of a hot oveu from 3 to 
5 minutes. Slide them right side up 
into a hot dish, and garnish with 1 or 2 
quarters of lemon. 

2. A verj common way in restau- 
rants is to merely stew the oysters in a 
bright tin pan holding only about a 
pint, slightly season, and serve them in 
the same pan set in a plate. And, fur- 
ther, in the same style neat lids are 



used that fit the pans, to be placed when 
the oysters are done and sent in so. 
There is no difference, except in the im- 
agination, betwixt that and a dry stew. 



322— Oysters in a Loaf. 



Take a loaf that has been baked in a 
tm mold, such as the bakers sell; cut oflf 
the top crust and lay it aside, remove 
most of the inside crumb, then cut the 
edge mto ornamental notches or saw tooth 
fashion all around. Spread a little soft 
butter inside with the back of a spoon 
and set the loaf in the oven to toast. The 
top generally gets browned enough by 
the time the butter inside is hot Make 
an oyster stew in the usual way but 
dredge in a few fine bread crumbs to 
partially thicken it. Pour into the hot 
crisped loaf on a dish, no cover. 



323— Scalloped Oysters. 

In a small deep dish or pan. Mince 
some slices of good bread extremely fine 
with your large knife and mix in about 
a third as much cracker meal. Cover 
the bottom of the individual dish with 
these mixed crumbs, and on them lay 
a dozen oysters. Dredge with salt and 
pepper, and drop butter in small bits. 
Cover thinly with crumbs. Have it 
slightly rounded up in the middle. 
Baie on the middle shelf one minute, or 
until a light toa^^t brown, then draw it 
to the front and baste the top with oys- 
ter liquor hot and with a little butter 
melted in it. 

Bake a few minutes. The object is to 
get a good bake on top without cooking 
the oysters too hard. Serve in the same 
dish set in another one. 



Cost of material — oysters 12, bread 
1, butter 2, table extras 4, 19 cents. 

Note. — The appearance is much im- 
proved if the oysters are scalloped in 
metal shells made for the purpose, either 
stamped heavy tin or silver plated. 
Proceed the same as with dishes.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL OAZETLES 



324— Scalloped Oysters on Half Shell. 

Oyster shells of good shape have to be 
selected and kept for the purpose. One 
large or two small oysters in each may 
be Bcall<»ped this way. Dredge fine 
bread crumbs in the shell, put in the 
oyster, cover with crumbs and bake set 
in a baking pan on the top shelf. When 
lightly browned moisten the tops with 
melted fresh butter and seasoned oys- 
ter liquor. Serve the moment they 
are done, or the hot shells will make the 
oysters cook too much. 

There is another way of scalloping 
them in sauce as directed for clams. 



325— Scalloped Oysters for a Party. 

Baked on a platter of a size according 
to number. 

Put a border of mashed potato forced 
like a thick cord through a paper comet 
all around the inner rim of the platter to 
hold in the liquor. The inside scooped 
out of baked potatoes is often the avail- 
able thing for this. 

Cover the bottom of the dish with 
finely minced or grated bread crumbs. 
Scald the oysters slightly in a saucepan 
and then place them close together on 
the layer of crumbs. Continue until the 
dish is piled up in the middle and 
rounded, with the butter, salt and pep- 
per as in the precedioej receipt, then mix 
the oyster liquor with a little milk and 
Btram over the top. Wipe the edges of 
the dish dry. Bake to get a quick 
brown on top, on the top shelf of the 
oven. 

Cost of material — each dish of one 
dozen 18 or 20 cents. 



326— Scalloped Oysters for Hotel 
Dinner. 



The thing to be guarded a'gainst is 
the getting it all bread and dry and hard 
and for that reason uneatable These 
proportions make it right. 

8 dozen oysters and their liquor. 

12 ounces 2 — cups butter. 



2 pound fine bread and cracker crumbs 
mixed. 

1 pint milk. Pepper and salt. 

Use a shallow 4-quart milk pan. 
Spread a little of the butter all over the 
bottom and cover that with a layer of the 
mixed bread crumbs. 

Scald the oysters in their liquor just 
enough to make them shrink a little and 
place half of them close together on the 
layer of crumbs. Then more crumbs, 
butter dropped about in small pieces, 
pepper and salt; then the rest of the oys- 
ters and cover with the remaining bread 
crumbs and butter. Mix the milk with 
the oyster liquor, strain into the pan, 
moistening the top all over. Bake from 
20 to 30 minutes. 

Cost of material — with oysters at $1, 
per 100— $1,40 for 16 dishes, or about 
9 cents per plate. 

327— Oyster Patties— White. 



The meaning is that the oysters are 
in a white sauce, for they may be either 
white, yellow, or brown. The same care 
that is needed to make a good stew ia 
necessary also to make patties delicious, 
that is, not to cook the oysters long be- 
Ibre they are wanted and not to let them 
get done too much . If the rich liquor of 
cream or milk and butter described for 
the "box stew" were thickened with flour 
just to the right point, then the oysters 
lightly cooked in another saucepan, dip- 
ped up and put into the sauce the. result 
would be reached of preparing the oys 
ters to fill any kind of patty cases with 
the white preparation. If thickened by 
adding raw yolks of eggs it makes the 
yellow sauce, if with butter and flour 
baked brown together and the oysters 
lightly cooked , stirred in at last it makes 
the light brown kind. To begin at the 
beginning take for 12 patties. 

1 cupful of oysters. 

1 cup milk. 

Butter size of a guinea t^^, 

1 taplespooD flour. 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



96 



Cayenne, salt. 

1 teaspoon minced parsley. 

1 pound of puflf paste. 

Make the puff paste shells first by roll- 
ing out to a quarter inch thickness, cut- 
ting out with an oval cutter and marking 
the inside lid, with a smaller cutter as 
previously directed for cherry tartlets, 
bake carefully in a brisk oven and when 
done lift out the center with a knife 
point. 

Set the oystrrs over the fire to scald 
in their own liquor, shake about until 
they are set, but take off before they 
boil. 

Mix the butter and flour together in a 
saucepan big enough to hold all the rest, 
and when it bubbles up on the range be- 
gin stirring in the milk, thus making a 
thick white sauce. Let it boil up, etir- 
rmg constantly. Season with cayenne 
and salt Take the oysters out of their 
liquor and put them in white sauce, and 
then stir in a little chopped parsley. Fill 
the patties, put on the lids and serve. 



Cost of material— oysters 10, milk 1, 
butter 2, seasonings 1, puff paste 10; 
24 cents, or 2 cents each. 

328— Oyster Patties— Ye How. 

Read the foregoing directions. When 
the thick creaan sauce has been made 
beat up the yolk of an q^^ with a spoon- 
ful of clear oyster liquor and stir it in, 
and add the juice of a quarter of a lemon. 

329— Oyster Patties— Bi own. 

Put an ounce of butter and an ounce 
of flour together in a small saucepan or 
pint cup and stir them over the fire until 
they are light brown, like the crust of a 
well baked loaf of bread in color, or else, 
if time cannot be epared to continue the 
stirring, set it in the oven, for none of it 
should be burnt black. When done stir 
in gradually ^ cup oyster liqnor and about 
half that quantity of milk, and salt and 
pepper to season, and at last a table- 
spoonful of essence of anchovies. Pass 
the sauce through a gravy strainer. 



Scald the oysters separately and put 
them in the brown sauce. Use to fill 
the vol-aw-vcrvt patty cases ot the forej 
going receipts. 

Note. — The exercise of judgment is 
required to have the sauces for such pat- 
ties as are made by filling pastry shells 
as above of just the right thickness not to 
run out and leave the oysters bare and 
dry inside, and yet not so thick as to 
make the mixture a lump of paste. The 
addition of the juicy oysters to the sauce 
often thins it down to a degree that is a 
source of disappointment to an inex- 
perienced person. Moreover, the addi- 
tion of yolks of eggs to the yellow kind 
will not thicken tliem unless the boiling 
be stopped immediately after. 

330— Oyster Patties. Household Style. 

Provide 12 deep tin patty pans hold- 
ing each about -J cup; 

1 cupful oysters. 

1 cup milk 

1 large tablespoon flour. 

Butter size of a walnut. 

Pepper and salt. 

1 pound short pie paste. 

Boil the milk, thicken it with the 
flour mixed up with a little milk cold, 
add a little salt and the butter and beat 
until the butter is melted. 

RoU out the common pie paste very 
thin, cut out with a large biscuit cutter 
and line the patty pans, put a few raw 
oysters in each, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, nearly fill with the thick white 
sauce previously made, cut out more 
flats from the sheet of paste and put 
them on as lids. Brush over with 
mixed yolk of e£g and water and bake. 
Serve hot with a sprig of parsley on top 
for ornament. 

Cost of material — from IJ to 2 cents 
each, according to size and richness. 

331— Oyster Soup— Common Lunch. 

To make to order have ready some 
boiling milk and serve in a bowl.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



1 pint milk. 

6 oyetera scalded in their own liquor, 
and the liquor strained into the bowl 
first Crackers and table sauces go 
free. Price in restanrants 15c. 

Cost of materifil — Oysters 5, milk 3, 
table extras 3; 11 cents. 

332— Oyster Soup— Good Hotel 

1 quart "solid meat** oysters. 
1 quart clear soup stock. 
1 qoait. railk. 
Butter size of an egg. 

1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. 

2 heaping tablespoons crushed oyster 
crackers. 

The stock is used on the principle that 
the liquor that meat has been boiled in 
is better than water. It should be chick- 
en or veal broth slightly seasoned with 
celery and parsley and other vegetables, 
and should be taken from the top, clear 
without sediment. 

The things to be guarded against are, 
not to get the milk curdled by boiling it 
with the oysters, and to avoid having 
the scum from the oyster liquor floating 
on top of the soup. To get out of the 
trouble shiftless cooks sometimes throw 
the liquor away and wash off the oysters; 
ot course that makes the soup poor. 

Half an hour before dinner time set 
the quart of stock on the range in one 
saucepan and the milk in another. Pour 
the oysters into a colander set in another 
saucepan on the table and when the 
soup stock boils pour a few ladlefuls into 
the oysters, stir them and let them drain. 
Then set the oyster liquor thus ob 
tained over the fire, when it boils skim it, 
then strain it into the soup stock. Next 
throw in the oysters and when they be- 
gin to shrink, showing they are fairly 
hot through take the vessel from the fire. 
Stir in the rolled crackers, (not cracker 
meal from the barrel,) the salt, pepper 
and butter, then at last add the boding 
milk and pour the soup into the tureen. 
Sprinkle a little chopped parsley over 
the top. 



Cost of material — oysters 40, stock 
4, milk 8. butter 5, seasonings 2; 59 
cents for 3 quarts or 12 large plates, or 
5c per plate. It should be observed in 
comparing cost that the previous receipt 
for the common lunch soup of the oyster 
houses supposes a pint or more to each 
person with crackers etc., on the table, 
A large soup plate is only half a pint 

333— Oyster Soup— French Way 

This is for 25 or 30 persons at a res- 
taurant party, or hotel dinner for 50. 

2 quarts of oysters — or 3 cans.

of parsely, salt, white pepper, the wine 
and anchovies. While it is boiling pour 
a few ladlefuls into the oysters and then 
drain them in a colander and add the 
liquor to the stock. When the fish has 
boiled slowly about three quarters of an 
hour strain off the ptock into another ket- 
tle, add a little thickening, (roita:,) let it 
boil and skim it; put in the oysters and 
while they are nearing the boiling point 
again beat the yolks and the pint of 
cream together and stir them in. Draw 
the kettle to the side of the range and 
watch till the s^up becomes smooth and 
creamy but take care not to let it boU. 
Taste for seasoning. 

Cost of material — oysters $1,50, fish 
stock 25, wine 50. yolks 25, cream 15, 
seasonings 5; $2,70, or about 10 or 12 
cents per plate.

Make some brown butter thickening 
(roux) by stirring together a cupful of 
butter and the same of flour in a frying 
pan and letting it bake brown in the 
oven. 

Strain off the fish slock into another 
kettle on the fire. Add the brown thick- 
ening, stirring lest it sink and bum on 
the bottom. Add the oyster liquor and 
draw the soup to the side of the range 
to slowly boil and clear itself by throw- 
ing up scum. Put in (he juice of a 
lemon mixed with a little cold water 
and skim when the soup boils up again. 
A few minutes before dinner time put 
the oyster? into the soup and take off as 
soon as i( ynce more begins to boil. If 
no anchovies have been us«id in the fish 
stock to heighten the flavor a spoonful 
of essence of anchovies may be added 
to the finished soup. Season with salt 
and cayenne. 

Cost of material — oysters $1,50, fish 
stock 25 butter for browning 15, flour

pose. If the large kind are used cut 
them in pieces after trimming and beard- 
ing. 



337— Clams— Shell Roast. 



Same as oysters. 



338— Scalloped Clams— Half Shell. 

Prepare the clams precisely as di- 
rected for oysters in patties, by making 
a white sauce of half clam liquor and 
half milk thickened and seasoned . Pat 
in the scalded clams. Then put a spoon- 
ful, or about two clams with the thick 
sauce adhering into eaeh clam shell. 
Dredge cracker meal over the top and 
bake on the top shelf in a hot oven. 
Moisten the tops with the back of a 
spoon dipped in melted butter. Wlien 
brown serve. About two to a dish for 
hotel dinners, or by the dozen at a res- 
taurant 



Cost — ^About the same as scalloped 
oysters. 

339— Scalloped Clams— Party Dinner. 

Take the clams out of the shells and 
scald them slightly in their own liquor. 
Replace them in the half shell, pepper 
and salt, and then cover with fine bread 
crumbs, and bake quickly. Make a lit- 
tle white sauce of the clam liquor mixed 
with cream and a little butter and spoon- 
ful.of flour thickening, and pour a spoon-

hotter, and the yolks slightly beaten, 
and salt and cayenne to taste. Squeeze 
in the juice of the lemon. Then put in 
the cut clams. Dish spoonfuls on toast 
cut in neat shapes, or on fried crusts. 

Cost of material — clams 35, yolks 6, 
milk 4, butter 4, lemon and seasonings 
3, buttered toast 8; 60 cents for 12 dish- 
es, or 5 cents per dish — or depending rn 
price of clams. 

Note. — The foregoing dish can be 
made cheaper if desired by several little 
omissions, and the breakfast or lunch 
dishes contemplated will be large enough 
for two at dinner where it is only a side 
dish. 



341— Clam Patties. 



The same as oyster patties, or, with 
the clams prepared as for scalloped or 
for fricasseed clams on toast put into 
pastry shells instead. 



342— Soft Shell Clams Fried. 



This is a large kind of clam with a 
brittle shell. Cut off the leathery dark 
portion that projects from the shell and 
remove with knife and fingers the beard 
and string from the inside. This leaves 
Ihe clam in the ring shape in which they 
come to market sometimes strung on 
twine. Throw them as they are taken 
out of the shell into a pan of cold water 
When wanted dry them between two 
towles, dip in beaten egg with a little 
water in it and then in cracker meal and 
fry in hot lard the same as oysters. Drain 
in a colander. Serve piled along the 
middle of a large dish with a quartered 
lemon and curled parsley for garnish. 

'Cost of material — Clams at $1,50 per 
100 15c, eggb 4, cracker meal 2, lard to 
fry 4, lemon 2, table extras 3; 30 cents 
per dozen. [Jsual charge 60 cents. 

Note. — Soft shell clams on account of 
their large size and open shape when 
cooked as above make a large and plen- 



tiful di8h,and a very popular one. One- 
third as many are sufficient for an ordinary 
breakfast dish for one person. The lard 
required is not all used but allowance 
has to be made for the damage as, after 
two or three fryings the lard remaining is 
unfit for further use. 

343— Scallops. 



The small, soft, white shellfish bearing 
this name may be cooked in all the same 
ways as oysters and clams, but is gene- 
erally preferred breaded and fried. 



344— Clam 



Chowder— Coney 
Style. 



Island 



The clam chowder so popular in the 
restaurants as a lunch dish is more of a 
stew than a soup, being thick with clams 
and potatoes; a large plate of it makes a 
hearty meal for a person. It is conse- 
quently unsuitable to serve as soup at 
hotel dinners. The Coney Island chow- 
der contains tomatoes and herb season- 
ings. Take 1 quart of clams and their 
liquor — or a large caa 

1 quart soup stock (or water). 

1 quart raw potatoes cut in pieces. 

1 large onion. 

Butter size of an egQ, 

A slice of ham — or knuckle bone. 

1 pint tomatoes chopped. 

1 teaspoon mixed thyme and savory. 

6 cloves, 1 bay leaf, parsley. 

1 teaspoon each black pepper and salt. 

The different articles should be made 
ready separately and placed conveniently 
for use. Have the clams scalded and 
then cut in pieces and the liquor saved. 
Cut the potaioes in large squares and 
slice the onions. An hour before dinner 
put the butter and ham in a saucepan to- 
gether, and the onions on top and set 
over the fire. Put the cloves inside of 
a little bunch of parsley and tie it and 
the bayleaf together and throw in on top 
of the onions, and also the powdered or 
minced thyme and savory, and put on 
the lid, and let stew slowly. In about 15 
or 20 minutes or before the ham and

onions begin to brown put into tbe same 
saucepan the quart of ^oup stock, the clam 
liquor and potatoes, tomatoes, pepper 
and salt and let cook until the potatoes 
are done, then i)Ut in the cut clams. 
Take out the soup bunch and piece of 
ham, let boil up once with the clams in. 

It is expected that the potatoes will 
sufficiently thicken this chowder without 
the use of fiour but they should not be 
allowed to boil so much as to disappear 
altogether. 

Cost of material — clams 40, soup- 
43tock 4, potatoes and onion 2, butter 4 
ham 2, tomatoes 5, seasonings 2, 59 
cents for 3 quarts or 20 c^nts per quart 
or 5c per ordinary plate of ^ pint. The 
first-class restaurant price per pint plate 
or bowl with table extras added is 25c. 



S^S^CIam Chowder— Boston Style. 

This is what is called the old-fashioned 
sort, having no tomatoes in it. Make 
the same as the foregoing but leave out 
the cloves, the bay leaf and the tomatoes, 
and put in a pint of milk instead and a 
handful of broken crackers. 



346— Baked Clam Chowder— HoteJ 
Side Dish. 



1 cupful clnms. 

1 cup of the clam liquor. 

1 cup salt pork cut in dice. 

2 cups sliced raw potatoes. 
1 small onion. 

1 teaspoon mixed salt and pepper. 

1 cup milk. 

•J cup crushed crackers. 

A deep pan or crock that holds 2 
quarts is nev-ded to cook this without 
boiling over. 

Cut the pork in dice, put it into the 
pan and bake it light brown. Take the 
pan out and strew some of the thin sliced 
potatoes all over the pork scraps and fat. 
Shave some slices of the rmionover them, 
then half the clams, cut in small pieces, 
then more potatoes, onion, and the rest 
of the clams. Potatoes on top and the 
crashed crackers over all Mix the quart 



of milk with the clam liquor, add the 
pepper and salt and pour it over the 
crackers. , Brush a sheet of thick paper 
with a little meat fat, lay it on top of the 
chowder and bake in a moderate oven 
about 2 hours. It will be partly browned 
on top. 

More liquid may be needed if the 
chowder boils away fast. It is done 
whenever the potatoes in the center are 
done. Dish out spoonfuls on flat dishes 



Cost of material — clams 15, pork 6, 
potatoes 1, seasoning 2; 24 cents for 3 
pints or 8 to 12 orders, or 2 or 3 cents 
per plate. 



347— Clam Soup— Hotel. 

1 can of clams or 1^ dozen. 
1 quart clear soup stock. 
1 cup raw potatoes in dice. 
J cup crushed crackers. 
1 slice raw ham . 

1 heaping tablespoon chopped onion. 

2 cups milk. 

1 tablespoon minced parsley. 

The soup stock should have been al- 
ready flavored with vegetables in the 
stock boiler. Strain the required amount 
and set it over the fira 

Fry the piece of ham at the side of the 
range brown on both sides, put it into 
the stock, without the grease and let boil 
in it for flavor, also, add the onions. 
Scald the clams in their own liquor a 
minute or two; take them out, pour the 
liquor to the soup through a fine strainer, 
and cut the clams in small pieces. Thirty 
minutes before dinner throw in tbe pota- 
toes and seasoning of salt and pepper 
and take out the ham which is no 
more needed in the soup), and skim a it 
begins to i oil again. Add the clams 
and boil a few minutes, and the cupful 
of crackers and chopped parsley and the 
milk which should be already boiling. 

The care required is to have the pota- 
toes done and not boiled away, and the 
crumbled crackers just dissolved in the 
soup without making it too thick.

Cost of material — clams 20, ponp 
stock 4, milk 4, seasonings 4; 32 cents 
for 2J quarts or 2 or 3c per pl^te. 

348— Clam Cream Soup. 

Out the clams in four and make the 
same as directed lor oyster soup with 
milk, and add a cupful of crushed crack- 
ers at the finish for thickining. 

349— Mussels— Steamed. 



Steam them in the shells until they 
open, then pull of the heard and take 
cut the mussel with a knife into a sauce- 
pan or dish. The way to steam them is 
to first wash the outside thoroughly and 
pack them in a kettle with only a little 
water on I he bottom to start the boiling. 
Put on the lid and set over the fire. 



350— Mussels— Water Sauchet. 



The mussels having been steamed as 
above and taken out of the shells into 
a saucepan, strain the liquor they were 
steamed in into another saucepan. Put 
in a titblespoon of chopped parsley, a lit- 
tle butter, salt and pepper and let it boil, 
then thicken slightly with flour mixed 
in a teacup with water. Put in the 
mussels aud serve with crackers, brown 
bread or toast. 



351— Mussels Stewed. 



Having steamed the mussels and 
taken them out of their shells make a 
milk stew the same as for oysters, by 
boiling a cup of milk and adding half 
cup of liquor from the steamed mussels 
with butter and pepper. Taste for salt; 
add a sprinkling of parsley. 

Cost — Count about the same as oys- 
ters. 



35?— Lobsters to Boil. 

Have a kettle of water with plenty 
of salt in it boiling briskly and drop in 
the live lobster. If small it will be done 



in 20 or 30 minutes, but a large obb 
takes three quarters of an hour. Cool 
and keep it on ice. 

353— Lobster in the Shell. 



Split the Lobster lengthwise and serve 
the half, the meat side up. Take off the 
large claws and crack them and place on 
the dish along with the half if it is a 
restaurant order. Garnish handsomely 
with curled parsley or endive and cut 
lemons. When served at hotel dinners 
they should either be small lobsters or 
be divided by chopping through the shell. 

Cost. — According to locality. Lob- 
sters alive can be bought at one dollar 
per 100 pounds in some places; in the 
interior they cost ten or twelve times as 
much Usual restaurant price with gar- 
nishings and table extras 40c per whole 
lobster or 25c half. 



354— Canned Lobster in Vinegar. 

Empty a can of lobster into a bowl 
and pour plain vinegar over. Serve in 
place of salad cold for dinner . 

Cost — Lobster 20, vinegar 4; 24 cents 
for 8 dishes or 3 cents per dish. 

355— Lobster in Mayonaise — Pastry.

1 cup mayonaise dressing. 

1 cup shred lettuce. 

2 tablespoons olive oil. 

3 tablespoons vinegar* 

1 teaspoon made mustard. 
Salt and cayenne. 

2 hard-boiled eggs. 

Take the meat out of a large lobster 
and keep the handsomest pieces of red 
meat separate after trimming all to a 
uniform size. Shake them about in a 
pan with a little oil and vinegar to mois- 
ten them. Cut the other portion of the 
lobster meat small, without mincing it, 
but mince the celery fine and mix both 
together along with a little oil vinegar

and mnstard, and pinch of cayenne and 
salt, then press it slightly into a melon 
mould or some kind of deep bowL 

Prepare the dish with a border of let- 
tuce or endive very finely shred (like 
filaw) with a sharp knife. Turn out the 
shape of mixed lobster and celery in the 
center and cover it all over with thick 
mayonaise (No. 151). Place the red 
pieces of lobster around the base and or- 
nament further with quarters of hard- 
boiled eggs. 

Cost of material — lobster 25^ celery 
and lettuce 4, mayonaise 15, oil and vin- 
egar or lemon juice 5, eggs 5; 54 cents 
for over a quart or 4 restaurant orders 
for 15c per dish, or 8 individual dishes 
for 7c per dish. 

356 — Lobster Mayonaise — Hotel 
Dinner. 



1. The same as the preceding except 
in shape. Instead of the dome shape or 
melon shape spread out the mixed lobster 
meat and celeiy in a flat platter so that 
it will be an inch deep and spread the 
mayonaise all over it. Keep it very 
cold. When to be served place a little 
freshly shred lettuce in the small dish, a 
neat spoonful of the salad in the middle 
ana pieces of red lobster meat around. 

2. The dishes can be made to look 
very neat and attractive by the way 
above described of taking up spoonfuls 
from a mass ready spread in a disb, (and 
it is quick to dish up,) but another way 
is to dish the lobster salad out of the 
pan it is mixed in into the individual dish 
with or without a border of green, 
then on top drop a tablespoonful of may- 
onaise, without spreading or smoothing 
it, and garnish with quartered eggs or 
or olives or a slice of lemon. 

Cost — About 5c per individual dish. 



357— Salad Cream Without Oil. 

Icup vinegar. 

icup water. 

t cup butter — 2 ounces. 



^ cup yolks of esrgs — 5 or six yolks. 

1 tablespoon made mustard. 

1 teaspoon sugar. 

Salt, cayenne. 

Boil the vinegar, water, batter and 
salt together in a bright saucepan, beat 
the yolks, and add to them some of the 
boiling liquid, then pour all into the 
saucepan, stir rapidly, and in a few sec- 
onds, or as soon as the mixture becomes 
thick and smooth, like softened butter, 
take it from the fire. Add the mustard 
and cayenne, and make it ice cold for 
use. 



Cost of material — 20 cents a pint. 

Note. — ^The foregoing is extremely 
useful for making a salad of almost any 
material; it should be practiced a few 
times until the proper point at which to 
remove it from the fire is well under- 
stood. It is generally thickest and 
smoothest in half a minute after the yolks 
are poured into the boiling liqaid, and it 
becomes thicker when cooled by being 
set in ice water. It will keep a consid- 
erable time. 

358— Salad Cream— Not Cooked. 



The vinegar is boiled but not the eggs 
and it is somewhat different from the 
preceding kind.

Mustard, pepper-sauce, salt. 

Boil the vinegar and water together; 
beat the eggs up a little in a bowl and

pie(^s and stir until it is melted. Add 
a little mustard thinned down in a cup 
first with some of the dressing.

Instead of maphing to a papte as m the 
preceding case, chop tbe lobster small 
and stir in the bread crumbs, melt the 
butter and pour in, add a little chopped 
parsley and make up in pear shapes or 
in any other shape, and bread and fry ap 
before 



367— Shrimps and Prawns. 



The small sea shrimp is generally eaten 
in the shell, the head and tail only re- 
moved, being more delicate flavor than 
the prawn but too small for most culi- 
nary purposes. The prawn is twice as 
large. It is the pink colored large shrimp 
of southern waters and is now readily 
obtainable put up in cans ready trimmed 
and shelled for use. 

Shrimps of all kinds are first cooked 
by dropping them in boiling salt water. 
It is said to show that they were dead 
when put in the boiler if they come out 
ying straight at full length; and it is 
considered ihey ought to be dropped in 
alive and consequently quite fresh, when 
they come out in the doubled form as 
they are seen in the market Ten min- 
utes boiling is enough. 

368— Shrimps in Mayonafse. 



Put the shrimps — already picked from 
their shells — in i pan or bowl, add a 
spoonful of vinegar and the same of ol- 
ive oil, a pinch of salt, and cayenne and 
shake them' about until they are mois- 
tened all over. Then heap them neatly 
in a dish. Put a border of minced cel- 
ery or shred lettuce around and a spoon- 
ful of mayonaise dressing on top of the 
phrimps. 

Cost — A cupful of prepared shrimps 
costs 25 cents, or twice as much as lob- 
ster. The ways of preparing lobsters 
serve equally as well for shrimps but the 
cost should be counted double — or the 
25 cent restaurant dishes be about half 
the cost of lobster salad. 



369— Shrimp Salad. 

Put the prepared shrimps in a bowl 
with salad cream enough to almost cov- 
er them. Prepare individual salad dish- 
es with a border of fresh shred lettuce 
and dish up a spoonful of the shrimps 
and sauce in the middle. 



Cost — shrimps 25, salad cream 5, let- 
tuce 1; 31 cents for 6 or 8 dishes or 5 
cents per plate. 

370— Buttered Shrimps 

Warm up the prepared shrimps in a 
frying pan with a little butter, pepper 
and salt and serve them as scon as hot 
through on a broad thin slice of buttered 
toast. 



371— Shrimp Toast. 

Pound the shrimps to a paste> season 
pleasantly with salt, pepper, a slight 
grating of nutmeg, a teaspoonful of lem- 
on juice and half as much best butter as 
there is shrimp, and spread it upon thin 
slices of toast A breakfast or luncheon 
dish. 



372— Crabs to Bofl. 



Boil the same as lobsters. The large 
deep-water crabs take the same length 
of time. Soft shells are done in ten or 
fifteen minutes. Qse the large ones if 
possible for salads and to dress cold. 

373— Soft Shell Crabs, Boiled. 

As served in the restaurants every 
part of a soft shell crab is eaten, shell, 
claws and all, except the eand pouch on 
the under side, . but the small claws 
should be taken off when the crabs are 
to be cooked by boiling. 

Drop the erabs into boiling water al- 
ready well salted, cook 10 or 15 minutes, 
drain, and serve with a sauce at the 
side. 

Tomato ketchup, mayonaise sauce,hot 
cream sauce or butter or parsley sauce 
are suitable kitids.

374_Soft Shell Crabs, Fried. 

Bread it in the usual manner by dip- 
ping in egg in which a small proportion 
of water has been beaten, then in cracker 
meal. Drop two or three at a time in a 
saucepan of hot oil or lard and fry light 
brown in about ten minutes. The claws 
should be crisp enough to break. Gar- 
nish with fried parsley and serve mayon- 
aise at the.flide separately. 

Cost — soft- shells bring from 10c to 
20c each in the markets when hard 
shells are but from 2c to 5c — according 
to where the market may be located. 
Two soft-shells tried, with sauce and ta 
ble extras constitute a restaurant dish at

6 boiled crabs, common size. 

1 cup finely minced white cabbage let- 
tuce, or endive. 

^ cup salad cream. 

Pick the meat out of the crabs, cut 
all that can be cut into pieces of even 
size and rub the rest smooth in salad 
diessing, adding a little mustard. Mix 
cabbage and dressing thoroughly, and 
the crab meat mix in lightly without 
breaking tho pieces. Fill the crab shells 
with the salad and place them on a dish 
previously prepared with a bed of cress 
or other green. 

Cost of material — 6 crabs 25, salad 
cream 5, green 2; 32 cents for 6 shells of 
Balad or 5 or 6c each. 



Boil the crabs in salted water 20 min- 
utes, open and crack the claws and take 
out the mejit, measure it with a spoon 
into a bowl and add half as many spoon- 
fuls of fine bread crumbs. For each crab 
add a teaspoonful of softened butter, 
same of vinegar mixed with a small tea- 
spoonful of made mu8tard,a pinch of salt 
and cayenne. Pack the mixture in the 
crab shells and cover the surface with 
cracker meal, bake brown in a brisk oven 
and baste the tops once with butter to 
moisten the breading.. Serve in the 
shells. 



Cost — about 5 cents each.. 



378— Canned Crabs Devilled;^ 



Note. — Crab salads may be made in 
all ihe same ways as shrimp and lobster 
salads; particularly good with mayonaise 
dressing. 

376— Dressed Crab, 

Pick the meat from the shell and 
claws, cut the solid part into small 
pieces, dry the soft part with the addi- 
tion of a spoonful of fine bread crumbs, 
mix all with a little oil, vinegar and

sauce together and stir into the crab. Sea- 
son to taste. Oil the crab shells inside 
with salad oil, fill up, smooth over the 
top, bake about 6 minutes and serve 
hot 



Cost — can of devilled crab 20, yolks 
7, butter sauce 3; 30 cents for 6 or 8. 



Note. — The canned crab is called dev- 
illed crab as it is, simply meaning that i- 
is minced and cooked. It is usually 
dryer than the meat taken out of the 
shells, being composed of selected meat — 
hence the difference between the two 
foregoing receipts, bread being needed 
in one case to dry it up. Crab shells 
may be saved over and used many times 
for the same purpose. When a number 
are to be served at once, dish them ou

QUAKER DAIRY LUNCH. 



Farinaceous and milk food ; such dish- 
es as mush and milk, bread and butter 
and fruit and buttermilk are the special- 
ties of some lunch houses. These are all 
cheap and healthful dishes and many cus- 
tomers avail themselves of the opportu- 
nity to avoid meat eating altogether. A 
large variety of pastry, puddings and 
cakes, however, gets into the bill of fare 
of most of the ** dairies" eventually, such 
as hdve been enumerated already under 
the head of fine bakery lunch, and a {qw 
more will be found following these- aim- 
pier dishes. 

380— Oatmeal Mush and Milk. 



1 cup oatmeal. 
4 cups water. 

2 teaspoons salt. 

The coarsest oatmeal is the best and 
the least liable to bum. It is the dust 
in oatmeal that sticks and scorches on 
the bottom, if that is washed away the 
tendency will be very much lessened. A 
double bottomed kettle can be used if 
steam enough can be kept up, but gen- 
erally mush seems better when cooked 
in a pot on a part of the range that is not 
very hot. 

Boil the water two hours before the 
meal, put in the oatmeal, cover down 



and let simmer at the side. Watch to 
see that it does not boil dry but only stir 
it up when nearly done. Serve warm, 
with cold milk in another bowl. 

Cost — with oatmeal 6c per pound — 
oatmeal mush 8c per quart or 3 large 
cups, milk 6; 3 cents each perbon. 

Note. — This being such a cheap dish 
and the usual price ten cents, some res- 
taurants serve a platter with an unstinted 
amount of mush and a pint of milk for 
that charga 

381— Cracked Wheat Mush and Milk. 



The same as oatmeal but the wheat 
needs longer boiling — say 3 hours. It is 
better for a previous soaking in water. 



382— Hulled 



Corn or Home Made 
Hominy. 



Steep a quart of white corn in weak 
lye for two days, wash in two waters 
and boil it about 4 hours or unlil tender. 
The lye from the leach of wood ashes is 
the kmd generally used, but a weak so- 
lution of concentrated lye will answer 
and if that is not available mix a handful 
of baking soda in water enough to cover 
the com twice over and let steep in that. 
Wash well before cooking, eat with salt 
and milk. 



Cost — the same as mush and milk, 
rem 1 to 3 cents each person. 

383— Soda Crackers and Milk. 

10 crackers and a pint bowl of milk. 
Usual charge 10 cents. 



384 — Graham or Oatmeal Crackers 
and Milk. 



Same as the preceding. 

385— Doughnuts and Milk. 

Prepare the dough as if for French 
roUs or cream rolls, roll out thin, cut out 
like small biscuits, bmsh over the tops 
with the least possible amount of melted 



106 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



lard and let stand in pans to rise for an 
hour. Take them up singly and drop 
in a kettle of hot lard and fry light brown 
in about 5 minutes. 



Cost of mat«irial — these small plain 
doughnuts 6 cents per dozen. Uusnally 
one with a glass of milk, 5c. 

386— Baked Pork and Beans. 



Wash and pick over a large heaping 
cnpfal of navy beans and steep them in 
water over night. Put them on next 
moning with fresh water to more than 
cover, and baking soda the size of a 
bean and let boil about an hour. Then 
carry them to the sink, pour all into a 
colander lettiug the water run away and 
put back into the saucepan with cold 
water enough to come up to a level. Boil 
again and in a few minutes they will be 
soft. Season with a little salt and table- 
spoon of molasses. Put them into four 
pint bowls or tin pans, lay an ounce slice 
of salt pork on each and bake half an 
hour. 

387— Boston Brown Bread. 



1 pound com meal — about 3 cups. 

1 pint boiling water — 2 cups. 

J cup black molasses. 

1 cup cold water. 

1 cup yeast or yeast cake in water. 

J pound of either rye or graham flour. 

} pound of white flour — a heaping pint. 

Salt. 

Pot.r the boiling water over the corn- 
meal in a pan and mix, throw in a tea- 
spoonful of salt, add the molasses and 
cold water, then the yeast and then the 
two kinds of flour. Line two sheet-iron 
brown bread pails with s:reased paper, put 
in the dough and let rise from one to two 
hours, ihen bake or steam for five hours. 
If steamed, bake the loaves afterward 
long enough to form a light crust. 



Cosi of material — corn meal 3, flour 
3, molasses and yeast 2; 8 cents for two 
2-pound loaves. 



Note. — A good sort of bread is made 
as above with a pound of graham cifted 
through a common flour sieve to remove 
the coarse bran, and the white flour omit- 
ted; or with all rye flour and no graham or 
white. Care should be taken not to 
scald the yeast by adding it to the hot 
meal before the cold water. When this 
kind of bread is sticky when sliced it 
shows it was made up too wet. When 
the loaves come out hollow or caved in it 
hows too much fermentation. 



Cost of material — beans 4, pork 4; 8 
cents for 4 dishes 



388— Sour Milk Cheese or Smearkase. 

Set a pan of clabbered milk on the 
stove when there is not much fire, and 
let it heat slowly without bumiug on the 
bottom. When it shows signs of boiling 
it should be taken ofi', as actual boiling 
makes the curd tough. Pour it into a 
piece of muslin, tie and hang on a nail to 
drip until next day. Chop up the ball 
of curd and mix with salt, pepper and 
cream to taste, or cream or sweet milk 
and sugar. 

Sells well at the dairy lunch houses 
When for sale in that way it is not ne- 
cessary to add any seasonings but a little 
salt. Serve in saucers. 

Cost of material — one e;allon sour 
milk value 20 cents will yield 12 ounces 
of cheese, which chopped and moistened 
with milk makes 3 half pints, or 6 of 
the little cheeses done up in tinfoil that 
we find for sale in the stores . 

389— Cream Cheese. 

Take a quart of cream that has become 
sour and thick, mix in a tablespoonful of 
salt and pour it into a piece of thin mus- 
lin (butter wrapping) placed in a sieve or 
basket bottom'. Leave it in the milk 
house or other cold place three days, to 
drain and ripen, pouring away the whey 
from the dish it stands on every day. 
Lift the cheese out by taking hold of the 
corners of the cloth; invert it on to a

plate. These are sometimes inverted on 
to a large cabbage leaf on the pecond day 
and taken to market on the leaf the next 
day by those who make them for sale. 

Note. — The above is the "slipcote" 
cheese of English dairies and country 
markets, and is the same in the main as 
the imported fromage de Brie, the dif- 
ferences consisting in the use of a pro- 
portion of goats milk in the laster, and 
peculiar skill in manipulation learned 
through practice among the English pro- 
ducers. 



390— Bake d Brea d Pudding. 

4 heaping cups bread — 1 pound. 
4 cups water or milk. 

1 cup finely minced suet. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 
2 eggs. 

1 nutmeg, or minced lemon peel. 

Bread being such a cheap article there 
is no economy in trying to use the dark 
crust of the stale pieces that are re- 
quired, but they should be pared until 
there is nothing but white bread left. 
Cut iuto thin slices and then across in 
dice, and put it in a pan having the minced 
suet first strewn over the bottom. Mix 
the milk, sugar, eggs and nutmeg to- 
gether and pour it over the bread. Set 
in the oven without stirring it up, bake 
until set in the middle. Serve out of 
the pan and pour sauce (No. 70) over in 
the saucer. 



Cost of material — bread 4, suet 2, 
sugar 2, eggs 4; 12 cents for near 2 
quarts — sauce 8--20 cents for 8 orders 
or 2Jc each — or 1^ for hotel dishes. 

Note — It is the genteel way in most 
places to bake the puddings in . bowls 
holding a pint and serve the sauce in 
small individual pitchers. Uusual charge 
ten conts. 



391-^Baked Rice and Milk Pudding. 

1 cup rice 
1 cup sugar. 



6 cups milk. 

Cinnamuu or nutmeg. 

A pinch of salt 

Wash the rice in three or four waters, 
put it into a tin pudding pan, and the 
sugar, milk, salt and piece of stick cin- 
namon with it, all cold, and bake in a 
slow oven tor three or four hours. It 
may be best to use only five cups of milk 
at first, and add the other if the time 
allows the pudding to boil down dry 
enough. Cover with a sheet of greased 
paper so keep the top from scorching. 
Sauce not necessary, but generally a 
glass of milk served with it. 



Cost of material — rice 4, milk 8, su- 
gar 5, seasoning 1; 18 cents for 3 pints, 
or 6 or 8 orders, or 3 cents each person. 

Note — The preceding is a favorite 
kind of pudding everywhere and in some 
of the finest hotels is nearly always of- 
fered as an alternative from the richer 
kinds. Its good quality arises from the 
slow boiling down and condensation of 
the richness of the milk. When it is to 
be baked in individual bowls it becomes 
necessary to boil it first ic a kettle and 
in that case the milk should be boiled 
down partially, with the sugar in it to 
prevent burning, befoiethe rice is put in. 
Then when done dip it into bowls, wipe 
off the edges and bake until top is brown. 



392— Cracked Wheat Pudding. 

4 large cups cracked wheat mush. 
Small half cup black molasses. 

1 cup minced suet — 3 ounces. 

2 eggs. 

1 cup milk or water. 

1 rounded teaspoon ground cinnamon. 

Mix all the ingredients together and 
bake about an hour. If wanted to make 
it better add a cup of raisins, but strew 
them over the top, for if stirred in they 
all go to the bottom. 

When this pudding is to be made ex- 
tra, wheat should be put on for the break- 
fast mush, to secure the benefit of the 
three hours cooking. When the mush

bappeDS to be cold; mash it\^ith the 
milk made hot, so as to have no himps. 

One laige cup of cracked wheat raw 
will make the above amount. The mush 
is expected to be dry. else use less milk 
or more eggs, The pudding has to be 
apparently quite fluid when put in the 
oven but comes out firm enough. 

Cost of material — mush 3, suet 2, 
molasses 2, eggs, 4, milk and cinnamon 
1; 12 cents for 3 pints or 6 or 8 orders or 
2 cents each, with sauce 3 cents. 



393— Lincol n Pie. 

1 pound broken crackers or bread. 

1 pound brown sugar or molasses. 

J pound currants. 

1 ounce mixed ground spices, chiefly 
cinnamon. 

1 pint cold water.

water. 

1 pound suet chopped fine, or lard. 

Soak the crackers or bread in the flu- 
ids awhile. jMix everything together. 
Cover the bottom of a baking pan with 
a very thin sheet of common short paste. 
Pour in the mixture to be 1^ inches 
deep. Cover with another very thin 
sheet of p^ste. Brush over with milk. 
Bake to a light color in a slow oven 
about three-quarters of an hour. Cut 
out squares either hot or cold. 

Cost of material — bread 3, sugar 8, 
currants 5, epice 5. cider 2, suet 10, 
pie-paste 11; 44 cents for 6 or 7 pounds 
or 14 squares. 

394— Baked CustaTd in Cups. 

1 quart milk. 

6 eggs. 

J cup sugar— 4 ounceb. 

Flavoring. 

Break the eggs into the sugar and 
pour in the milk while beating. Grate 
in a quarter of a nutmeg. Fill five 
^pint cups with the custard, wipe off" 
the edges and outside, set in a pan and 
4i>ake in a slack oven about 20 minutes. 



Be careful not to let the cups remain in 
the oven longer than till the custard is 
just set in the middle. 

Cost of material — milk 8, eggs 13, 
sugar and flour 3; 24c, or 5 cents per 
cup or according to price of eggs. These 
are restaurant cups that sell as pudding 
at 10c. Common custard cups only half 
the size. 

395— Blackberry Meringue. 

Make the same as strawberry mer- 
ingue at Na 195. 

396— Peach Meringue 

Pare ripe peaches (not cooked) and 
cut them to size of strawberries and 
make the same as strawberry meringue 
at No. 195. 



397— Peach Shortcake. 



The same thing as strawberry short- 
cake, using chop ,jed ripe peaches instead. 
It is a cake of short paste, not sweet, as 
large as a plate and thick as a biscuit, 
split in two after baking,peache8 and su- 
gar spread on the lower haL^, the other 
placed on top with the split side upward 
and more peaches spread upon that. It 
is eaten with cream. The ingredients 
required are: 

1 cup lard or butter — 8 ounces. 

3 cups flour — 12 ounces. 

^ teaspoon salt. 

1 CUD ice water, 

1 quart cut peaches. 

1 cup sugar. 

Pare the peaches, cut them small and 
shake up with the sugar before making 
the paste, and set them in a cool place. 
Rub the butter into the flour thoroughly 
with the hands. Salt is needed only 
where lard is used. Make a hollow in 
the middle, pour in the water, mix up 
soft, roll out on the table in flour re- 
served for the purpose. It makes the 
cake flaky and part in layers to roll it 
and fold it a few times like pie paste. 

Then make it up round, let stand five 
minutes, roll out thick as biscuit and

1 cup rice — J pound. 

2 cups water. 
1 cup milk. 
Salt. 

Wash the rice in three or four waters, 
rubbing it between the hands to remove 
all the flour there may be about it. Set 
it on to boil in the water and when half 
done put in the milk. Keep the lid on 
and never stir it, but simmer at the side 
of the range and it will not be apt to 
bum. 

Serve like oatmeal or commeal mush, 
in a bowl with another bowl full of milk. 



Cost of material — rice 4, milk 2; 6 
cents a quart or 3 or 4 portions — with 
milk 4 cents each person. 

402— Batter Cakes with Syrup. 

No eggL needed, and raised with yeast 

3 cups flour — 12 ounces, 

2^ cupb water and yeast. 

1 tablespoon melted lard. 

1 tablespoon syrtip. 

-^ teaspoon salt 

The yeast may be either ^ cxrp of po» 
tato yeast or ferment, or J a yeast cake 
in so much water. Sift the flour into a 
pan, make a hollow in the middle, strain 
in the yeast and water, stir around to 
mix in the flour gradually and when all 
melted without being lumpy add the other 
ingredients and beat thoroughly. Let 
sta.nd in a warm place to rise 6 hours, 
beat up again and bake. When the 
cakes are for breakfast mix the batter 
over night with cold water according to 
the weather. 



Cost of material — flour and yeast 3, 
lard and syrup 2, 5 cents for 3 pints, 24 
cakes or 8 orders. See remarks about 
buckwheat cakes. The cakes cost noth- 
ing relatively, it is the syrup, butter, 
and made of baking that make the ex- 
pense. 

403— Flannel Cakes—Best. 

4 cups flour. 

4 cups warm water. 

•J cup ysast. 

1 tablespoon syrup. 
Lard size of an e^^. 

2 eggs. Little salt. 

Mix the ^ flour into a batter with tlie 
yeast and water either over night, if it is 
for breakfast, or 6 hours before supper. 
An hour before it is time to bake add 
the other ingredients — the Lird melted 
and beat well. Bake when light again.

404— taking Powder Batter C2kes. 

Same iDgredients as * 'flannel cakes," 
but no jreast. Put in two large teaspoons 
of baking powder and beat up with an 
e^ beater. 

405— White Bread Cakes. 



2 pressed -in cups bread crumbs. 

IJ cups flour. 

8 cups water. 

2 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoon baking powder. 

Bemove all dark crust from the bread, 
and then soak it in a pint of the water 
several hours, with a plate to press it 
under. Mash smooth and add the flour, 
the cup of milk or water, eggs and pow- 
der. It always improves batter cakes to 
beat the eggs light, before mixing them 
in. No shortening nor syrup needed for 
the above. 



Cost of material — bread 2, flour 5, 
eggs and powder 5/ 8 cents for 3 pints 
or 24 cakes. 



406— Graham Bread Cakes. 



Make like the preceding, with part 
graham flour, and the crumbs of graham 
bread. 

407— Corn Batter Cakes.

1 cup flour — 4 ounces. 
1 tablespoon melted lard. 

1 egg. Little salt. 

2 cups water. 

1 tablespoon syrup. 

1 teaspoon baking powder. 

Mix gradually to avoid having lumps 
in the batter. Add the powder last and 
beat up well. When you have milk 
leave out the syrup as the cakes will 
brown well enough without it. 

408— Corn Cakes Without Flour. 

2 cups com meal 12 ounces. 
2 cups water. 

Lard size of an egg. 



2 eggs. Little salt. 

1 teaspoon baking bowder. 

Boil halt the water {or milk) and scald 
ihe meal with it, add the other iogredi- 
ents, the powder last. 

Note. — Buttermilk aud soda can be 
used instead of baking powder in the 
several kinds of batter cakes, the pro- 
portions are 1 teaspoonful soda to 2 €up3 
butter milk-which should be sour enough 
to counteract that amount. 



409— Rice Batter Cakes. 



I heaping pint dry cooked rice. 

1 large cup milk or water. 

6 ounces flour — 2 level cups . 

2 eggs (or 5 yolks for best quality). 
2 tablespoons syrup. 

1 teaspoon baking powder. Salt 
The amount of rice to be cooked spe- 
cially for this is one teacupful, boiled in 
a pint of water, with the steam shut in. 
If ready cooked cold rice, warm the milk 
and mash the rice with it free from 
Inmps, adding flour at the same time. 
Then mix in the other ingredients; the 
eggs well beaten first. Bake on a grid- 
dle. Buttermilk and soda can be used 
instead of the powder and sweet milk. 

410— Sugar Tops or Cookies Without 

Eggs. 

1 cup butter or lard — 8 ounces. 
1 cup sugar — 8 ounces. 

1 cup water. 

2 teaspoons baking powder 
6 cups flour — IJ pounds 

Mix butter and sugar together, then 
the water (not too cold) then the flour 
with the powder in it. The softer the 
dough can be handled the better the 
cakep will be. Roll out thin, sift gran- 
ulated sugar over, run the rolling pin 
over again to make the sugar stick; cut 
out and bake.

rates with great rapidity and great force 
when the substance it is incorporated 
with is exposed to the action of beat 

In making sugar cakes or cookies some 
practice is necessary to produce them 
properly for the reason that the softness 
of the butter or lard used makes a dif- 
ference in the amount of flour that will 
be taken up in making them out, and if 
too much flour the cakes come out like 
common biscuits, so that with the same 
receipt to work by one person will make 
a sugar cake twice as good as another. 
Another thing to be watched is the 
amount of baking powder — whether the 
common household bakinf> powder or 
ammonia it all ai- s the sime — because 
too much destroys the cakes by making 
them too light, full of holes and spread 
all over the pans, while with too little or 
with v/eak powder they remain harder 
than crackers. 

411— Cookies— Good. 

2 cups sugar — 1 pound. 

1 cup butter — 8 ounces. 

6 eggs. 

1 cup milk- 

4 teaspoons baking powder. 

8 cups flour — 2 pounds. 

Soften the butter and rub it and the 
sugar together until well mixed, add 
the eggs one at a time,then the milk and 
flour with powder in. Sift flour oii the 
table, turn out the lump of dough and 
pat it smooth and compact, keeping if 
quite soft. Thn roll it out thin as the 
edge of a dinner plate, dredge granu- 
lated sugar over and cut out the cakes. 
Place with plenty of room between on 
the baking pans and bake. 

The dough when it has been suffi- 
ciently pressed or kneaded together 
should be alio we 1 to rest on the table a 
minute or two before rolling: out which 
will prevent the cakes drawing up out of 
shape when cut out. 

412— Cookies — Riche st and Best. 

1 pound of sugar. 
1 pound of butter. 



12 eggs. 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Flour to make soft dough — 3 pounds. 

Cream the butter and sugar together 
the same as for pound cake. Beat the 
eggs and mix them in, then the powder, 
add some flavoring, then flour. Let 
the dough, after it has been worked 
smooth, stand a few minutes before roll- 
ing it out. Sift sugar ovnr the sheet of 
dough before cutting out the cakes. 



413— Hard Cookies or Sweet Crackers. 



To cut in fancy shapes. They do not 
spread or lose form.

4 cups flour — 1 pound. 

Work the softened butter and sugar 
together to a cream, the same as for 
pound cake, beat the eggs and mix them 
in, then the milk, and the flour with the 
powder mixed in it. Keep the dough 
as soft as it can be handled. After it 
has been pressed and worked smooth on 
the table let it alone a few minutes before 
rolling out, then the cakes will not draw 
out of shape when cut. 

While they are baking mix an egg and 
some -syrup together in a cup. add some 
flavoring extract, brush the hot cakes 
over with it and dredge gravel sugar on 
top. 

Gravel sugar is loaf sugar crushed and 
the dust sifted away, then again sifted 
in a colander. The sugar that passes

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



through the holes of the colander is 
gravel sugar. 

415— Jumbles. 



These are cookies in ring shapes of vari 
Otis degrees of richness. The proper shape 
is ribbed by being forced out of a tube 
with a saw tooth aperture. Commonly, 
however, they are only rings made with 
a ring cookie cutter. Either of the fore- 
going mixtures for sugar cakes or cook- 
ies may be used or this, which is rich 
and contains no powder, 

1 pound sugar.

Make a hole in the middle of the flour 
and put in the sugar, molasses and ex- 
tract; dissolve the soda in a spoonful of 
water and add it to the rest. Stir all 
together, drawing in the flour gradually 
while stirring. 

Drop this batter with a teaspoon on 
baking pans — they need not be greased — 
and Lake in a slack oven. The snaps 
run out flat and thin. Take them off be- 
fore they get cold and bend them to 
round or tubular shape on a new broom 
handle.

and sugar, mix, add the eggs, the gin- 
ger and powder, and lastly the flour. 

It is a great improvement lo beat the 
cake thoroughly with a spoon. It is too 
soft to be handled. Spiead it an inch 
thick iu a buttered pau or mold. Bake 
twenty or thirty minutes. 



Cost of material — molasses 3, sugar 
2, butter 8, eggs 7, ginger 1, powder 1, 
flour 3 ; 25 cents for about a two quart 
mold or about 20 cuts in a thin sheet for 
hotel supper.

Black-Pudding a la Franoaise. 

Chop fine a few large onions, and 
boil them in salt and water, with a 
little thyme and bay-leaf. When 
done, strain them and remove the 
seasoning herbs. Next cut up in 
smaJl dice one pound of inside fat of 
the pig or "flare," and mix it with 
the chopped onions and a quart of 
pig's bloid ; season with salt, pepper, 
and some ground spice, and fill up 
some skins cleaned and prepared for 
the purpose. Tie the skin with string, 
so that each pudding may be the 
length of an ordinary sausage; care 
being taken to allow a little loose 
space between each individual pudd- 
ing, or the skin will burst during the 
process of cooking. Plunge the 
puddings in water at boiling-point, 
and let them remain at the corner of the 
stove,but without boiling, stirring them 
occasionally with a wooden spoon. 



White-Pudding a la Parisienne. 

Pound in a mortar twelve ounces of 
raw chicken with four ounces of leaf 
lard ; season with salt, pepper, and a 
little grated nutmeg. When well 
pounded, add gradually four whites 
of eg^ and three-quarters of a pint of 
double cream. Remove the meat 
from the mortar, and pass it through 
a wire sieve. Then work it in a 
basin with a wooden spoon, and add 
to it three ounces of trufiies cut in 
dice, and the same quantity of ox- 
tongue also cut in small dice. Next 
put this forcemeat into a biscuit-bag 
fitted with a long tin pipe, and with 
it fill up the skins, which you tie as 
in the foregoing recipe, and poach in 
water at boiling-point for fifteen 
minutes, taking care that the water 
does not boil.

FINE CONFECTIONERY GOODS. 



424 — Peanut Bar. 



1 pound gi'anulated sugar. 

f pound shelled peanuts. 

Make the peanuts hot in the oven. 
Set the sugar over the fire in a kettle to 
melt without any water. Stir it a little. 
When it is all melted and of the color of 
golden syrup or light molasses mix in 
the peanuts, pour the candy into a but- 
tered shallow pan and when nearly cold 
cut into strips and blocks. 

425— Mint Drops. 

1 pound pulverized sugar. 

1 heaping teaspoon powdered gum- 
arabic. 

5 tablespoons water. 

1 tablespoon essence pepperment. 

Put the water on in a small saucepan 
or cup and the gum in it and let warm 
up. When the gum is dissolved put 
about a quarter of the Eugar in, let boil 
up and then add half the sugar that re- 
mains putting it in gradually without 
stirring. When it boils again take it to 
the table and stir in the remaining sugar 
and after that the flavoring. Drop por- 
tions the size of quarter dollars on bheets 
of paper. They slip off the paper when 
cold. It may be neces'^ary to add an- 
other tablespoon or two of sugar to give 
the drops consistency enough not to run 
on the paper, yet it is better it be too 
thin than too much the other way. 

426— Wintergreen Drops. 

The same as the preceding, but make 
them pink with a few drops of cochineal 
or vegetable red coloring and use winter- 
green extract for flavorins:. These drops 
have a smooth surface but are slightly 
granulated inside. Clove drops, cinna- 
mon drops etc., same way. 

427— Honey Nougat. 

A moist candy to be sliced, wrapped 
in wax tissue paper. 



4 tablespoons strained honey. 

2 ounces almonds, blanched. 

1 pound flour of sugar,or icing sugar. 

Make the honey hot without boiling, 
stir in the sugar a little at a time until 
it becomes too firm, then turn out on the 
table and knead in more sugar and also 
the almonds, which must be dry. When 
the nougat is firm enough to keep its form 
in a square bar like a brick split length- 
wise, sugar the outside, roll it in wax 
paper and keep it a day before slicing it 
up tor sale. Wrap the little cuts like- 
wise in wax paper . 

428— Tutti-Frutti Candy. 

Take the preceding receipt and add to 
it a teaspoon of vanilla, two figs cut small 
and an equal amount of raisins seeded 
and cut; work up into a bar with all the 
fine, powdered sugar necessary to make 
it firm, cut in slices and wrap in wax 
tissue paper. 

429— Burnt Almonds. 



1 pound shelled almonds. 

1 pound sugar. 

^ cup water. 

1 level teaspoon cream tarter. 

Set the almonds in a round-bottom- 
ed candy kettle over a moderate fire and 
stir them until they begin to parch. 

Boil the sugar, water and cream tartar 
together, making a clear syrup, pour a 
little over the almonds in the kettle and 
keep them moving while it dries to su- 
gar on them, then pour on more and so 
on till the syrup is all used and the al- 
monds are thickly covered. A little red 
coloring can be added to the syrup near 
the last to make the outside coating of 
that color. 



430— Almond Taffy— Brown. 

IJ pounds brown sugar. 
8 ounces best fresh butter. 
1 teacupful of vinegar and water — 
about half and half. 

8 to 12 ounces almonds. 

Scald and peel the almonds, split them

and spread them evenly ou tvro large 
dishes slightly buttered. Boil the other 
mgredienta together about 15 or 20 min- 
utes. Shake tliem together at first but 
do not stir. When a drop of the candy 
sets quite hard and brittle in cold water 
take it from the fire and pour it evenly all 
over the almonds, only just deep enough 
to cover them. This kind cannot be 
stirred nor pulled, as the butter separates 
from the sugar which then turns grainy. 
Mark it off with a knife while cooling, 
and when cold cut in strips and wrap 
them in wax paper. 

431— Almond Candy— White. 

•^ pound almonds. 

1 pound granulated sugar, 

1 small cup water. 

1 rounded teaspoon powdered gum 
arable. 

1 level teaspoon cream tartar. 

Little extract of rose. 

Dissolve the gum in the water -made 
warm, add the sugar and cream tartar 
and boil without stirring 15 or 20 min- 
utes. When a drop in cold water sets 
nearly hard so that it can only just be 
presssed flat between the finger and 
thumb take the kettle off the fire. Drop 
the flavoring by spots over the surface, 
give the candy only one or two turns 
with a spoon to mix it in, then pour it 
into slightly buttered pans, in thin 
sheets. Push the split almonds into the 
warm candy with the fingers. Mark it 
before it gets cold for breaking by rolling 
over it the thin edge of a thin dinner 
plate. Sliced cocoanut can be used in- 
stead of almonds. 

432 — Cocoanut Cream Squares. 

1 pound granulated sugar, 

8 ounces cocoanut either fresh grated 
or desicated. 

A small half cup water, 

Set the sugar and water over the fire 
in a small bright kettle and boil about 5 
minutes, or till the syrup bubbles up 
thick and ropes from the spoon, and do 
not stir it. Then put in the cocoanut, 



stir to mix, and when it begins to look 
white pour it immediately into a shallow 
tra pan. As soon as it is set solid mark 
it off, and cut in little squares when 
cold. The same kind may be colored 
red, and also be made wtth chocolate. 

433— Chocolate Cream Drops. 

^ pound fine icing sugar. 

1 teaspoon powdered gum arable. 

2 tablespoons water. 

1 teaspoon extract vanilla. 

^ pound common chocolate. 

Cut up the cake of chocolate into a 
tin cup and set in a shallow pan of hot 
water to melt by heat alone without ad- 
ding any water. 

Dissolve the gum arable in the two 
tablespoons of boUing water in a small 
bowl, then stir in fine powdered sugar 
enough to make it a stiff dough, adding 
the vanilla at the same time. Turn it on 
the table, rull into a cord, cutoff in balls 
size of hazel nuts and dip these in the 
melted chocolate. Set on a pan or dish 
to harden. Makes 75 to 100. 



434— Chocolate Creams— Best. 



Make the white inside the same as for 
the preceding and make the balls up in 
any shape desired, Ins^^ead of common 
chocolate merely melted dip them in this 
chocolate icing; 

1 cup sugar 

4 tablespoons water. 

2 ounces common chocolate. 

Grate the chocolate and set it on with 
the sugar and water to melt gradually 
in a place not hot enough to burn it. 
VVhon it has at length become boiling 
hot beat it to thoroughly mix, and dip 
in the articles to be glazed while it is 
hot.

436- Walnut Creams. 



1 pound fine icing sugar. 

2 heaped teaspoons powdered giira 
arabic. 

5 tablespoons water. 

3 doz walnut kernels. 

1 teaspoon extract vanilla. 

Put a little sugjar in the water to 
make a syrup, and the gum in it, stir 
over the fire until the gum is dissolved. 
Take it off and work in the powdered 
sugar gradually with a wooden paddle. 
Add the vanilla. The more it is stirred 
and beaten with the paddle the whiter 
and finer the candy becomes. At last 
turn out the lumps on to the table — it is 
like soft white dough — and roll it in one 
long roll, cut off slices, stick a half of a 
walnut kernel in each piece and piuch 
the paste up to hold it, by shaping it in 
the hollow of the left hand. Lay the 
finished creams on a tray to dry. This 
makes about 6 dozen. The sugar is not 
boiled, only the hot gum syrup is used. 

437— Date Creams. 



The same as the preceding kind with 
dates cut in pieces to use instead of wal- 
nuts. 



438— Fig Creams. 



Cut each fig in six or eight and pro- 
ceed as for walnut creams. 



439— Angelica Creams. 

Flavor the cream candy with extract 
of strawberry instead of vanilla. Cut 
green angelica or any other French can- 
died fruit of a rich color and use as di- 
directed tor walnut creams. 

440— Cocoanut Cream Balls, 

1 pound pulverized sugar. 

1 teaspoon powdered gum arabic. 
5 tablespoons water. 

2 tablespoons cocoanut, minced. 
2 tablespoons currants, minced. 
1 teaspoon lemon extract. 



Dissolve the gum in the water hot and 
stir in the sugar gradually, flavor, fruit 
and cocoanut. Work the paste on the 
table with sugar until it is firm enough, 
roll into one long cord half an inch thick, 
cut off pieces and roll into balls a little 
larger than cherries. Sugar well outside 
and let dry. The same can be made 
with candy colored pink. The foregoing 
kinds are all easy to make because there 
is no boiling of sugar. 



441— Fine White Sugar Candy-Pu'*ed. 

1 pound white sugar, 

•J cup water. 

•J teaspoon cream tartar. 

1 ounce butter. 

Oil of peppermint or lemon or other 
flavoring. 

Boil all together, except the flavoring, 
about 15 minutes. Try by dropping a 
little cold water. It must set hard to 
be done. Do not stir it at all, but pour 
on a buttered dish and flavor when 
cool enough to handle. Pull it till it is 
quite white. 

442— Lemon Car.dy— Clear. 

1 pound granulated sugar. 

1 teacup water. 

1 rounded teaspoon powdered -gum 
arabic. 

J teaspoon cream tartar. 

Oil of lemon, few drops. 

Dissolve tbe powdered gum in the 
water made warm for the purpose. Then 
add to the gum- water the sugar and 
cream of tartar and set on to boil. Do 
not stir the syrup after it is once well 
mixed. It should boil about 15 minutes. 
Then try it by dropping a little in cold 
water. VV hen the lump retains its shape 
pretty well and can be worked between 
the fingers like gum paste it is ready. 
Pour it into the buttered plate or in little 
molds of fish shapes and the like or into 
a thin sheet to be used broken for mixed 
candies. The flavoring may be dropped 
in spots in the kettle just before turning 
out, and stirred around once.

443~Lemon Cream Candy. 

Take the same iogredients as for the le- 
mon candy preceding and bull to the same 
degree — that is, when the drop in a cup 
of cold water sets brittle around the thin 
edges but still can be pressed to any 
shape between the thumb and finger — 
then add the flavoring and begin to stir 
it rapidly with a spoon. In from 10 to 
20 turns it will begin to turn white 
and creamy. Then pour it quickly on 
to a buttered pan, or into cream bon-bon 
molds made of plaster paris or formed 
in a tray of starch. 

444 — Rose Candy — Clear. 

1 pound granulated sugar. 

1 teacup water. 

1 rounded teaspoon powdered gum 
Arabic 

^teaspoon cream tartar. 

Red coloring, few drops. 

Rose extract to flavor. 

Dissolve the gum in the hot water,put 
in the sugar and cream tartar and boil. 
When it has boiled about ten minutes 
try a drop in a cup of cold water. When 
it sets hard around the edges but still so 
that the entire drop can be pressed to any 
shape between the finger and thumb it is 
ready. Take it from the fire, drop in the 
flavoring and cochineal and stir around 
only once or twice to mix. Pour it into 
the buttered plate, or shapes, or into a 
shallow pan, to be broken and used for 
mixed candies. 



445— Rose Cream Candy. 

The same ingredients and proportions 
as the preceding receipt. Boil to the 
same degree. Then take the kettle from 
the fire, let it stand 5 minutes to lose 
some of its heat, add red coloring enough 
to make it pink, and a few drops of rose 
extract. Have a buttered dish ready, 
stir the candy rapidly with a spoon till it 
begins to change its bright appearance to 
a dull color, that is a sign of setting,then 
pour it immediately into the dish, or into 



cream bon-bon molds made of plaster 
paris, or formed in a tray of starch. 

446— Butter Scotch. 



1^ pounds light bmwn sugar. 

^ pound best fresh butter. 

J teacup vinegar. 

J teacup water. 

Put all on to boil in a candy kettle, 
stir at first to mix well but not alter- 
wards. When it has boiled 10 minutes 
try a drop in a cup of cold water. When 
it sets hard and brittle so that it breaks 
between the thumb and finger, pour it 
in a thin sheet in a buttered dish to cooL 
This kind cannot be stirred nor pulled, 
as the butter beparates from the sugar, 
which then granulates. Cut in squares 
when cold and wrap the squares in wax 
tissue paper. 

J, 447— Caramels— Lemon. 



. 1 pound granulated sugar. 

J cup water, 

1 ounce butter — guinea-egg size. 

4 drops oil of lemon. 

Boil all together, except the flavoring 
about 10 or 15 minutes. Try by drop- 
ping a little in cold water. It must set 
hard and brittle. Do not stir it at all 
except two turns to mix in the oil of lem- 
on. Pour into a buttered •shallow pan, 
mark o£f while cooling, and cut io square 
caramels. Wrap in wax paper. 



448— Chocolate Caramels. 



1 pound sugar — either brown or white 
will do. 

1 ounce butter. 
Half cup milk. 

2 ounces grated chocolate. 
Vanilla flavoring. 

Set the milk, butter and sugar on to 
boil, and stir in the grated chocolate and 
flavoring. After that do not stir the 
mixture again or it will go to sugar in 
the dish. Boil about 10 minutes. When a 
drop in cold water sets rather hard but 
not brittle pour the candy into a dish

well buttered. Mark in little square 
blocks when set. Warm the dish or tin 
tray a little if the candy sticks . 

449->Molasses Candy to Pull. 

1 large coffee cup molasses. 

12 ounces sugar, either brown or 
white. 

One-third cup vinegar. 

Half cup water. 

1 ounce butter. 

Put all in a kettle and boil 15 or 20 
minutes' Try in cold water. It must 
boil till the drops set brittle and fairly 
snap between the fingers. Then pour it 
on buttered plates, Pull. 

' Molasses candy if not pulled but merely 
allowed to set on dishes is improved by 
having about half a teaspoonful of soda 
stirred in after it has been taken from 
the fire and before it is poured out. Fla- 
vorings may be added at the same time, 

450— Chocolate Candy to Pull. 

ounces sugar. 

ounces light colored molasses or 
Byrup. 

Half cup cream . 

J ounce grated chocolate. 

Vanilla to flavor. 

Boil the cream, molasses and sugar 
together for about 15 minutes, then 
throw in the chocolate and boil till the 
candy sets brittle in cold water. Pour 
on dishes, flavor when cold enough to 
handle and pull. 

451— Fig Paste. 

3 pints water. 

IJ pounds sugar. 

3 ounces com starch. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

6 ounces glucose. 

Boil sugar and water together and 
thicken with the starch same as in mak- 
ing a thickened pudding sauce, then put 
in the glucose and lemon juice and cook 
at the side of the range about 15 min- 
utes. Color a portion of it pink. When 



nearly cold mould it into any form and 
roll in powdered sugar. 

452— Frosted Grapes. 

Take grapes of two colors as red To- 
kays and white Muscadels and pull the 
bunches apart into clusters of three or 
four grapes each. Prepare a platter with 
the sort of pulverized sugar known as 
fine granulated, and make it warm. 
Whip some white of eggs in a shallow 
bowl, dip the grapes in it, lay them on 
the sugar and sift more sugar on top. 
Lay them on sieves to di-y. 



453— Grapes Gl^ed with Sugar. 

Divide some bunches of grapes into 
small clusters. 

Put into a deep saucepan, 

1 pound sugar. 

A large cup water. 

J- teaspoon cre^m tartar. 

Stir to dissolve the sugar, then set it 
on to boil, as if for candy. 

When the syrup has boiled 10 minutes 
try a drop in cold water. When it sets 
so that it is hard to press between finger 
and thumb and the edges of drops are 
hard and brittle it is ready. 

Take it from the fire, dip the clusters 
of grapes in (without ever stirring the 
candy) and lay them on dishes slightly 
greased to diy. Should the candy be- 
come set in the kettle it may have a 
spoonful or two of water added and be 
made hot again. 

454 — Frosted Oranges. 

Make plain white icing and use it to 
dip orange slices in just when it has be- 
come too thick with beating not to run 
off, and yet thin enough to settle to 
smoothness. Or, if so good that it has 
already become too firm, thin it by add- 
ing the white of another t^g or part of 
one. 

Prepare the oranges by peeling and 
separating by the natural divisions, with- 
out breaking the covering or getting the 
pieces wet. Have a long splinter or

thin skewer ready for each one, and fill a 
large bowl with sngar or salt and stick 
them in. Stick the point of a skewer 
into the edge of the orange section, dip 
into the frosting, push the other end of 
the skewer into the bowl of salt, and let 
the pieces hang ovei the edge of the 
bowl in a warm place to dry. 



456— Oranges Glazed with Sugar. 

Oranges divided and put through the 
Bame course as grapes glazed with sugar. 

There has been no calculation of the cost 
of the articles in this division which come 
under the head of candies, because they 
are not necessary in counting the cost of 
meals and, further, because they can be 
purchased cheaper than they can be 
made in small qnantities. For the man- 
ufacturers have learned now to use large 
proportions of glucose instead of sugar 
and honey, and likewise make savings 
jn their flavorings and in buying large 
quantities. There are times, however, 
when it is desirable to have a candy 
party in the house and, as people say, 
"it is nice to know how." 



457— Almond Macaroons. 



8 ounces granulated sugar. 

4 whites of eggs. 

8 ounces almonds. 

1 teaspoon lemon juice or pinch of 
cream tartar. 

Put the sugar and tT70 of the whites 
in a deep bowl together, and beat with 
a wooden paddle about fifteen minutes, 
then add another white and beat again, 
then the lemon juice and then the last 
white. Crush the almonds by rolling 
them with the rolling-pin on the table. 
They i.eed not be blanched (freed from 
the skins) unless so preferred. When 
they are reduced to meal mix them with 
the contents of the bowl. This mixture, 
as well as cake icing, should always be 
started with bowl and ingredients all 
cold , for if warm they cannot be beaten 
to the requisite degree of firmness. 



Drop portions size of cherries on bak- 
ing pans previously greased and then 
wiped dry. Bake in a slack oven, until 
light brown. Too much heat in the oven 
will cause them to melt and they should 
be little more than dried pale brown. 



Cost of material — sugar 5, almonds 
20, white of eggs and acid 6; 31 cents for 
4 dozen. Turn to star kisses, No. 5, 
and note the difference in cost made by 
the almonds. 



45d— Common Boxed Macaroons. 

12 ounces almonds. 

8 ounces granulated sugar. 

4 ounces flour. 

4 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

1 teaspoon ammonia. 

Crush the. almonds without taking ofP 
the skins, with a rolling.pin upon the 
table. Mix them and the powder, su- 
gar and flour together in a bowl. Drop 
the eggs in the middle and mix the whole 
into a rather sof »; dough . Place in lumps 
size of cherries on baking pans very 
slightly gre-^sed. Bake in a slack oven 
light brown. A few bitter almonds or 
peach kernels mixed in improves them. 

Cost of material — 45 cents for 2 
pounds gr about 6 dozen. 

459— Meringue Paste. 

This in various forms has to be men- 
tioned often in these colmmns. It is al- 
ways white of egg and sugar, but is 
sometimes soft meringue as on lemon 
pies, aad some time^ nearly all sugar as 
in cake icing and **kisses." 

460— Meringues a fa Cream. 



1 pound of granulated sugar. 

6 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring extract. 

3 drops of acetic acid, or a pinch of 
tartaric, or a little lemon juice. 

Put half the whites in a bowl without 
beating, and all the sugar with them 



120 



SAN FRANGISGO HOIEL GAZEITE'S 



and beat together with a woodeo spoon 
or paddle. It may save half the labor 
and insures success to have all the uten- 
sils and ingredients quite cold to begin 
with. It quickens the process if the 
beating can be done with two paddles, 
using both hands as regular woi-kmen 
do. The bowl should be a deep one 
holding two quarts. 

The sugar and t^ at first are as stiff 
as dough. Beat rapidly and constantly 
for about 15 minutes, when it should be 
white and rather firm cake icing. Now 
add the remaining 3 whites of eggs, one 
at a time, and beat a few minutes be- 
tween each one, but before the last one 
is added put in the acid and the flavor- 
ing. 

The whole time of beating is about 25 
minutes. An essential point is to beat 
the icing after the addition of each white 
until it will again draw up in peaks after 
the paddle is lifted from it, except the 
last white which should not be beaten 
much as it fonuR the gloss and smooth- 
ness on the meringues when they are 
baked. 

Have ready some strips of writing 
paper two inches wide and pieces of 
boards (not pine) to bake the meringues 
on. Plac& spoonfuls egg-shaped on the 
strips of paper, not too close, smooth 
them with a knife, place the strips on the 
boards and dry-bake them with the oven 
door partly open. They need to bake 
nearly or quite half an hour. They can 
be lifted off the paper when cold." The 
boards prevent a cruet forming on the 
bottom and the soft rem<iinder inside can 
be scooped out. Pill the meringues with 
whipped cream sweetened and flavored, 
or with wine jelly, and either place two 
together side by side with melted candy 
or icing, like an open walnut shell, and 
pile whipped cream or chopped jelly upon 
them. These meringues likewise look 
well singly as cups filled with brtght 
jellies of different colors and with ice 
creams. 

Cost of material — 20 cents for 30 sin- 
gle meringues or "kisses." Place two 



together with whipped cream, sweetened 
and flavored, inside, cost of filling 10' 
cents; 30 cents for 15, or two cent? each 
on an average. But the timft and labor 
are more than the material. 



461— Ra se Me ringues. 

Having made the meringue paste ac- 
cording to the preceding directions, color 
it, or a part of it a delicate pink and fla- 
vor with rose extract. Drop with the 
sack and tube. pieces like large marbles on 
baking pans previously greased and then 
wiped dry, and bake slowly without col- 
or. These rise rounded and nearly hol- 
low and have a gauzy appearance when 
rightly baked. 

Note — Sometimes the first panful of 
any c»f these varieticb put into the range 
will run together and melt and come out 
worthless, and the next came out perfect 
meringues, or one side of the pan will be 
spoiled and the remainder good. This 
shows that the baking is the critical part^ 
of the making,and that is what we never 
can teach by word of mouth. At a cer- 
tain gentle heat the egg in the meringues 
cooks and dries in shape, but at a 
higher degree the sugar melts and runs 
to candy in bubbles. At an insufficient 
degree of heat the mewugue dries as it 
would in the sun and does not swell and 
chanfi^e its appearanca In the brick 
oven after the bread has been withdrawn 
is the proper place to bake meringues. 

462— Chocolate Meringues. 

There is nothing of the kind cjioicer 
or more fragile than these. Only a slight 
change in the ingredients from the fore- 
going varieties. 

1 pound granulated sugar. 
6 whites eggs. 

3 ounces gnted common chocolate — 
si heaping cupful. 

2 teaspoons vanilla extract. 

Beat up the icing as directed for me- 
ringues a la creme, and when it is fin- 
ished mix in the chocolate thoroughly. 
Drop round portions with the sack and 



COOKING FOR PROFIT.

tube on baking pans and bake at a very 
gentle beat. These rise rounded like 
a mushroom, and nearly hollow. They 
slip from the pans easily when cold. 

Cost ot material — see star kisses and 
meringues a la creme. 



463— Almond Rings and Fingers. 

Make the same as the preceding with 
8 ounces of blanched almonds minced 
very small instead of chocolate. Put a 
smaller tube in the forcing sack, and 
form finger shapes and rings of the al- 
mond meringue paste on baking pans, 
and bake them in a v&rj slack oven. 
These all bake light and nearly hollow 
and have a fine glazed surface. 

Note — The foregoing varieties, which 
can all be made out of one large bowl of 
meringue paste, form a handsome as- 
sortment for the cake stands, to build 
pyramids, to place around glass bowls 
of fruit, to decorate cakes and to fill 
icing or nougat baskets with. 

464>~icing and Ornamenting Calces. 

Fruit cakes always need two coats of 
icing. Common glaze or sugar only, 
melted with white of egg, may do for the 
first, and it to be very nice, mix some 
minced almond in it. The first coat will 
dry in an hour in a warm place. 

Cake icing is the same as the star 
kiss mixture or meringue, at No. 5, only 
it is surer to beat sugar and whites to- 
gether in a bowl, and powdered sugar 
makes the smoothest icing. Put into a 
deep bowl two whites and a cupful of 
sugar, which makes a stiff paste, and 
beat them with a wooden paddle fifteen 
minutes. Add some flavoring extract. 
To smooth over the cake cut a strip o 
writing paper an inch wide and, stretch- 
ing it between the hands, draw the edge 
over the top of the cake. 

To make a border put some of the 
ing into a comet made of writing paper 
and pinned. Clip of the point, and the. 



pipe of icing that is pressed out can be 
laid on the edge of the cake like a braid 
Leaves and flowers can be bought ready 
made. 



465~Wine and Fruit Jellies. 



To make the brilliantly clear, many- 
hned,and delicately flavored jellies that 
are found on the fables of the best hotels 
and at the confectioners, the simple lemon 
jelly has first to be made in perfection. It 
is technically called stock jelly, because, 
when finished, it can be mixed with wine 
or other liquors and cordials,or be flavored 
and colored to make as many varities as 
may be desired. 

It may be as well to explain that these 
jellies are transient and will not keep 
over two or three days, not like the 
boiled fruit jellies, but of the same nature 
as the old-fashioned calf's foot jelly, 
made now with gelatine. 

Once making stock jelly should serve 
either for a large party or two or there 
meals. 

For 3 quarts of jelly take: 

3^ quarts of water. 

ij pounds of sugar. 

4 ounces of gelatine 

5 lemons— juice of all, thin shaved 
rinds of 2 or 3, according to size. 

1 ounce of whole spices— cloves, mace 
and stick cinnamon. 

6 whites of eggs to clarify it 

Put the water in a bright brass kettle, 
add all the other ingredients — the lemon 
juice squeezed in without the seeds, the 
yellow rind pared very thin, and the 
white of eggs beaten a little with some 
water mixed in first The clean egg 
sheUs may be put in also to assist in the 
clarification. Use the sheet gelatine that 
floats, for preference. Then set the ket- 
tle on the side of a range and let it slow- 
ly come to a boil with occasional stirring. 

Let it boil about half an hour, and 
above all, to avoid the trouble and waste 
of having to boil it again, be sure that 
the white foam of egg on top becomes 
thoroughly cooked so that it will go 




y'

down and mix with the jelly again like 
so much meal. Sometimes, to accomplish 
this, as a lid cannot be kepi on without 
its boiling over, it is necessary to set the 
kettle in the oven, a few minutes to 
get heat enough on top. 

Then run it through a jelly bag sus- 
pended from a hook. The boiling hav- 
ing been properly attended to, there 
should not be the slightest difficulty in 
getting it to run through not only clear 
but bright and transparent as glass. The 
first pouring coats the inside of the fil- 
tering bag with the coagulated white of 
egg,and each succeeding running through 
brightens the jelly. 

It may be tet down as a rule that this 
kind of jelly cannot be successfully made 
without more or less lemon juice, or some 
acid equivalent — it will not run through 
a filtering bag without. A cheaper 
quality can be made with less sugar and 
lemons. 

The stock having been made, it can 
now be divided into as many kinds as 
may be wished. But the stock jelly is 
already good and mildly flavored and 
care should be taken not to over season 
it, or injure its bright appearance. 

Lemon extract cannot be put into jelly 
because it makes a milky appearance and 
dims its brilliancy. Orange extract the 
same . IMost of the other extracts can be 
used to flavor. Use wine in small pro- 
portion to mix with some of the stock, 
and color deep red , but run through the 
jelly b-ig again while it is yet warm. 
Flavor some with vanilla, and color it 
either amber or brown with burnt sugar. 
Flavor some with strawberry and color it 
pink, and leave some plain, pale yellow. 

Cost of matenal — sugar 15, gelatine 
average 40, lemons 10, spices 10, whites 
10; 85 or 90 cents for 3 quarts or 50 sau- 
cers or glasses for dessert. 

466— One Quart of Jelly. 

The rule is for good quality. 
1 quart of water, 



IJ ounces of g;elatine. 
8 ounces of sugar. 
1 or 2 lemons. 

1 teaspoonful of whole mixed spices. . 

2 whites ofegg;s and the clean shells. 
But a cupful of water must be added 

to allow for evaporation and loss, unless 
it is intended to add ^ pint of wine to the 
stock jelly produced. 

Note, — There are different kinds of 
gelatine and some thai is imported will 
if bought at retail cost nearly double the 
above estimate for that ingredient, while 
some of the sheet gelatine can be bought 
at a dollar a pound or one third less than 
our count. 

467— Soda Mead. 



A "health drink" for summer. 
Make a syrup with: 

1 quart water. 

2 ounces of whole spices consisting of 
equal quantities of cloves, stick cinna- 
mon, ginger, coriander, seed and carda- 
mons. 

1 tablespoon powdered gum arable. 

4 pounds honey. 

Boil the spices in the water about 
half an hour, strain into another sauce- 
pan, put in the honey, boil up and skim, 
dissolve the gum in it. Use same as so- 
da syrup, about a gill to each glass of 
poda. Thegnmis to produce foam and 
white of egg answers the same purpose 
but not to keep long. 

468— English Mead— Small Quantity. 

A fermented beer of the "root beer'* 
sort. 

To make five gallons procure either a 
keg that size from the liquor stores or a 
stone jug. Take: 

4 gallons water — (a pail and a half.) 

16 pounds honey — (20 large cups.) 

1 ounce hops. 

1 ounce of coriander seed&^. 

Rind of 2 lemonc. 

^ cupful of yeast — or yeast cake sof- 
tened (with water.) Boil the honey and 
water together about an hour, skimming

frequently, until no more scum rises. 
Tie the bops in a piece of muslin, and the 
coriander seed and shaved lemon rind in 
another, put them in a tub or large stone 
jar and pour the boiling liquor upun them . 
When it is no more than milk warm, 
spread yeast upon both sides of a piece 
of toast and set it floating. Cover and 
let stand in a warm place to ferment for 
three days, then draw it off without sed- 
iment into your five gallon keg,*stone jug 
or demijohn. Let stand six hours longer, 
full to the brim, so that whatever rises 
may run over, then cork down and keep 
cool. The longer it is kept the better. 

469— Wine Mea d in Small Quantity 

4 pounds of hon«y — 6 cupg. 

2 gallons nearly of warm water — 30 
cups. 

\ cupful of yeast — compressed , dis- 
solved will do. 

Mix the honey, warm water and yeast 
together and fill up a two- gallon jug or 
keg with it. Set it in a warm corner to 
ferment, and as the yeast rises and runs 
over the mouth of the jug keep it filled 
up with the quart that was left over. 
When the fermentation stops cork it tight 
and keep cool. 

It becomes better with keeping for 
several months, and ought to be in bot- 
tles. 

It is recommended to improve the fla- 
vor to put in two lemons sliced, and half 
pint of brandy, both to be put in the keg 
or jug after Uie fermentation has ceased. 

470— Ho me IVia de Beer. 

It helps the understanding of what is 
to be dote if you have never made beer 
before to remember that any kind of 
sweetened liquor with a little yeast ad- 
ded will ferment and become '*pop** in 
three or four days. The difference in 
strength of beers is according to the dif- 
ference of amount of sweetening in the 
liquor used, strong beer or ale being 
made with plenty of malt and other 
sweetening added and small beer made 



by adding more water to the same malt 
for a second drawing. Once the method 
is understood it is only a question of dif- 
ferent flavoring to make spruce beer, gin- 
ger beer, or any other variety as they all 
go through the same process. 

471— Molasses Beer. 



Procure a 10 gallon keg and another 
holding 5 gallons, or a jug or two, as 
there will be about 15 gallons of beer. 
T«ke 

8 ounces hops. 

4 quarts coarse ground malt. 

6 pounbs brown sugar. 

3 pints rebelled Cuba molasses. 

1 pint brewers yeast or a quart of 
baker's stock. 

Boil the hops in a kettle with 2 pails 
of water about half an hour, then pour it 
boiling hot over the malt, sugar, and mo- 
asses in a tub, stir up , let stand an hour, 
then strain the liquor without stirring up 
the sediment into a keg. Boil 2 pails 
more of water, pour it to the malt etc., 
remaining in the tub to extract the re- 
maining substance and when it is settled 
strain it into the keg along with the first, 
then use another pail of water the same 
way but it need not be boiled , only have 
the yeast added and when the large lot 
is no more than milk warm strain this 
yeast water into it. 

Let ferment in the kegs 2 cr 3 days, 
according to the temperature, kpeping 
them full to the bung so that the yeast 
may work over and run off. Then cork 
tight and keep a week or a month as 
may be desired. If drawn off clear after 
ermenting and bottled it becomes very 
strong after a few weeks. 



472— Ginger Pop. 

8 quarts water. 

2 ounces raw ginger pounded to pieces. 

2 lemons. 

8 heaping cups sugar. 

2 tablespoons cream tartar.

479— Beef Celery. 



A bot *'healtb drink," sold at con- 
fectionaries and dmg stores. Take 
3 pounds lean beef. 
8 large beads celery. 

3 quarts cold water. 

4 wbites of egga. 
2 teaspoons salt 

J teaspoon cayenne. 

Cbop the beef until it is like sausage 
meat, and chop the celery including the 
roots, the came way. Mix them with 



the cold water and set at the side 
of the range to heat up gradually, then 
let boil about an hour, add the salt and 
pepper. Then strain the liquor (bouillon) 
through a seive or napkin held over a 
bowL Take off every particle of grease. 
Add the white of eggs and beat them in; 
boil again and strain three or four times 
over. Add a spoonfuU of burnt sugar 
to give a brown color. When cold add 
the whites of two more eggs to make a 
slight foam on the hot drink. 

To use, take a third of a glass of the 
preparation and fill up with boiling water 
poured in from a height. There are hot 
water fountains that discharge into the 
glass with force like soda. 



Hot Drinks. 

Hot Tom and Jerry. 

Take a punch-bowl, into which put 
the yolks of twelve eggs, and beat 
them up until as thin as water; then 
add one pound of powdered sugar, 
half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, 
ditto of ground clove, ditto of allspice; 
next beat the whites of eggs into a 
stiff froth, pour into the first bowl, 
and mix well ; then add one bottle of 
brandy, one ditto of Jamaica rum. 
This will be sufficient for a party of 
twenty. 

To serve Tom and Jerry proceed as 
follows: - Take two shakers, heat them 
well with boiling water ; then pour in 
half of the mixture and half of boiling 
water, and keep pouring them from 
one shaker to the other, until you 
have attained a good froth ; then heat 
your tumbler and pour the liquid in, 
which sprinkle with a little grated 
nutmeg on top. This will be found a 



delicious drink for a cold winter's 
night. 

Hot American Punch. 
Take a punch-bowl ; put in a quarter 
pound of loaf sugar, the juice of a 
lemon; then add half a pint of brandy 
and half a pint of Jamaica rum ; then 
set light to this ; next make an infu- 
sion of green tea, one ounce to a 
quart and a half water ; pour the tea 
gently into the bowl, and add the rind 
of half a lemon. The compound must 
be served flaming, and will be found 
sufficient for a party of fifteen. 

Mailed Claret 
Boil for twenty minutes in a pint 
of water six cloves, the thin rind of 
two lemons, quarter of a pound of 
sugar, and a stick of cinnamon four 
inches long broken into small pieces. 
Add two bottles of claret or burgundy 
previously warmed, and when the 
whole boils add a wineglassful of 
brandy or curacao ; strain into glasses, 
grating a little nutmeg over each.

Eight Weeks at a Summer Resort 



This is my diary of a time when 
I went out to gain experience at a 
small place, as compared with our 
hotel magnitudes, but a first-class 
summer boarding house, neverthe- 
less, situated on the shore of that 
beautiful sheet of water called Uintah 
Lake in the State of Cornucopia. A 
great number of interesting questions 
oonceming the business of boarding 
people for profit are to be answered 
in this way as will be seen as we go 
along, but more especially the object 
I have in view is to stop once for all 
the ceaseless inquiries of a lady friend 
who keeps a boarding house and is 
very economically disposed. This 
lady knows that I have been cooking 
for profit all my life and is aware 
that I have become quite indifferent 
in regard to the state of the market, 
the state of the larder, or the state of 
the storeroom, having learned that a 
good meal can be made out of very 
slim materials if one knows how to 
manage, and therefore seems to ex- 
pect that I can answer the hardest 
kind of questions off-hand on all sorts 
of unexpected contingencies. 

"Oh," she said one day when I 
was going out just after breakfast, 
"before you go do tell me what I 
can have for dinner?" and she put 
her hand to her head in the same old 
state of perplexity she was so well 
used to. 

"Well, Mrs. Tingee, a suitable 
soup would be — " 

**The weather is too warm for 



soup," she broke in with, " and be- 
sides, I have nothing to make it of, 
and Anne would not have time." 

In this respect I think she was 
wrong. In warm weather people 
take liquid food all the more readily 
and the soup is seldom too hot. I 
find that the only two dishes that are 
invariably^ eaten out clean with no 
remainders are the soup and ide 
cream. However, I went on: 

"If it is to warm for soup, you 
might get a fine bluefish and stuff 
and bake it with about a pound or 
less of slices of pickled pork laid 
under and over it, or a pompano or 
two of them, broiled, with softened 
butter and lemon-juice, and roast 
some young chickens, and get some 
of that early summer squash and 
corn that has come from the South, 
and a half gallon of thick, sweet 
cream and a dozen boxes of straw- 
berries and then if you have some 
sponge cake and delicate cake ready 
made and frosted and iftake your 
coffee strong and clear, you may get 
through this dinner time very well 
and you have all the afternoon and 
night in which to plan for to-mor- 
row." 

" I don't want to know that," the 
lady snapped out, half cross. " Do 
you know that I have had to drop 
the price of day board from four 
dollars a week to three dollars and a 
half, because the boarders teased me 
so to do 8o; they ssid they could not 
stand it to pay more and I had to do 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



it, and I should like to see myself 
buying strawberries for them at 
thirty cents a quart and cream at 
twenty-five. Anybody can go to 
market and buy the best of every- 
thing and make a good dinner; what 
I want to know is what you do when 
you have no pompano, no chickens, 
no fresh vegetables, no fruit, no 
cream, no cake, no nothing — now 
tell me that" 

'^Can't tell you*, Mrs. Tingee, but I 
will write out what it costs to give first- 
class board, plentifiil, reasonably rich, 
but not extraordinary^ nor extravagant 
and perhaps you will pick out some items 
that will be usefiil to you." 

So the knotty question of "What do 
you do for a good meal when you 
nave nothing that you want to make it 
with?" recurs continually. How, for 
instance, can we serve mint sauce with 
roast lamb in Senator Sawmill's town, 
where not only no mint is to be bought, 
but none of the inhabitants apparently 
have ever heard of any other mmt, but 
Uncle Sam's, where money is made? 
And here is another instance : 

500— A Little Party Supper. 



Jane 25. The proprietor of the Hotel 
D*Arlington came out with a cigar in his 
mouth and stood by smiling for a few 
minutes while I was cutting meat for 
supper. There was something coming. 
Presently he said : 

"I can't let you go to Uintah Lake for 
two days yet. Does it make much dif- 
ference?" 

"What has happened?" 

'*Melnotte, the actor's troupe disbands 
here to pass the vacation at the summer 
resorts, and he wants to give a little fare- 
well supper to-night, and to-morrow 
night the college graduates have a straw- 
berry and ice cream party in the dining 
room." 

"It is after four o'clock now; not 
much time to get up a supper when our 
regular supper runs till eight." 

"But they don't want this till eleven 
and it is just a little cold supper nicely 
set on the table, nothing elaborate. I 
don't want it to cost much — ^what can 
you give them?" 



"There are plenty of things, I supnose 
that can be given for such an occasion, 
but one can't say in a minute. It b a 
bad time of year for a cold party supj)er 
—no oysters. Will there be any ladies ; 
that is, shall we want any sweets— ice 
cream?" 

"Miss Ophelia will be in the party. 

"That is the star actress?" 

"Yes, and one or two others, and two 
newspaper men, but I would not go to 
the trouble of ice cream— there wilTonly 
be seventeen all together." 

"We must have some chickens.'' 

"I m afraid we can't get any. I have 
not seen a chicken in this town since the 
frost broke up." 

"Turkeys, then" 

"Harder yet. I saw one old gobbler 
at the butcher's three weeks ago, but it 
is a thousand chances to one against 
finding one now." 

"We have the best of all sorts of 
butcher's meats for every meal, but you 
don't want to sit your actors down to 
dishes of the same meats cold that they 
have had hot three times in the day 
already. Cold roast fowl would be a 
rarity, and then there must be a salad 
and it ought to be of turkey or chicken. 
Perhaps you can find canned chicken 
at the stores, and if it is not very good 
for salad alone it can be made better by 
mixing with white veal which we can get 
at the Dutchers. It may be that you can 
find boneless roast turkey in cans, too, 
and one or two will snfiice. And get 
some canned Baratana shrimps and let 
the boy try once more for parsley." 

"No use ; the people in tnis town don't 
know what parsley isi but I will tele- 
phone to the stores about the other 
things — do you want any lobster?" 

"1 think not. Canned lobster is an 
abominadon. Take shrimp instead, and 
lettuce and lemons." 

The telephone having been employed 
and yielded nothing, a boy was sent out 
I who returned in an hour with the intel- 
I ligence that in all this town of 15,000 in- 
habitants there was no poultry either 
fresh or canned, but one merchant sent 
word that he had. some nice canned crab 
and with each two-pound can, eight crab 
shells were furnished to bake in ; that he 
supplied some of the same to Mrj. Con- 
gressman Wmdmill's partv^ and they 
were much pleased. So this following 
was the bill-of-fare that resulted :

on it; and, the waiters out of pure good 

wUl ^ent out in the twilight and despoiled 

somebody's garden of large bunches of 

lilac and snowballs for decoration.

501— A Dish of Devilled Crabs. 



Opened the x cans. They proved to 
De solid packed and good, only a little 
too salty. It is the common way, to mix 
fine bread crumbs with the crab meat, 
but there being rather more than enough 
of this, the only addition made was a 
cupful of rich butter sauce made with 
melted butter, to avoid adding the salt 
drqgs, and some pepper. Buttered the 
insides of the shells; filled 20 of them, 
rounded up, and on top pressed some 
very fine minced bread crumbs; baked 
to a toast-brown in the oven and basted 
with a table-spoonful of melted butter. 



Ready an hour before supper time? 

To serve : Covered each one of three 
large platters with four of the handsom- 
est lettuce leaves, the curled green edges 
coming around the edges of the dishes, 
and arranged the crabs in star form upon 
them with quartered lemons between the 
points. 

502— Sardines With Brown Bread and 
Butter; or^ en Canape. 



Shook out three boxes of sardines on 
to a dish, took up the unbroken sardines 
with forks and laid on paper to dram. 
Chopped a green pickle extremely fine 
and a hard boiled egg and mixed them 
together. Cut long, tHm slices of graham 
bread about width of two fingers, but- 
tered them, sprinkled the minced gar- 
nish down the middle of each with a 
tea-spoon, and laid a sardine upon it. 
Arranged these diagonally on two small 
platters with radishes scraped in stripes 
laid between. The other three boxes of 
sardines were opened and served in 
the boxes as they were, for those who 
might prefer them, on platters having a 
border of shred lettuce. 

503— Cold Corned Tongue. 

Red tongue sliced slantwise, extremely 
thin, enough for two small platters. 
Minced green radish tops in little heaps 
around the edges for ornament, and a 
thin, round slice of lemon in the middle. 



504 — Shrimps in Mayonaise. 



This is only another term for shrimp 
salad and it is not necessary that the 
mayonaise dressing (No. 151) be used 
every time. 

Took 5 hard-boiled yolks and 3 raw. 

Yz cup olive oil. 

1 table spoon sugar. 

2 teaspoons salt and i of pepper. 
I teaspoon made mustard. 
Juice of 2 or 3 lemons. 

A small cup vinegar. 

Whipped whites of 3 eggs. 

Rubbed all the yolks to a paste with 
the back of a spoon and added oil, sugar, 
mustard, salt, pepper, lemon juice and 



SAN liRANCISCO MOTEL GAZE'ITE'S 



vinegar, all a little at a time. Kept the 
lettuce in cold water till the last, then 
shook and dried between two napkins. 
Shred the white hearts fine, like slaw, 
and mixed the shrimps with it. Whipped 
the whites, added to the salad dressmg, 
poured over the salad, stirred up lightly, 
dished in two deep glass dishes and gar- 
nished with the boiled whites in rings and 
little roimd cuts of radishes. Set salad 
plates handy and silver forks for the 
waiters to serve it from the dishes if re- 
quired. 



507— Fresh Strawberries. 



505— Maids of honor. 



This is the old-fashioned name of some 
sorts of cheese cakes or tartlets. As it is 
often to be met with in^ English and old 
Virginia bills-of-fare it is necessary to use 
the term, if only for explanatory pur- j upon the eatables showed plamly that 



Washed them in a large jar of cold 
water to free them from sana. Picked 
and heaped them in three glass bowls 
with individual pitchers of cold cream 
and bowls of powdered si^^ at hand, 
and piles of glass sauce dishes. Cake 
of two or three varieties in the usual 
cake baskets on folded napkins. 

It was not, then, a strictly cold supper 
after all, since the devilled crabs were 
fresh and warm, but what was of more 
consequence than that, the enture party 
expected, did not come. There was a 
moonlight excursion by steamboat that 
night and Miss Ophelia, and the two 
ladies and the two newspaper men went 
off on the boat and only twelve re- 
mained; still, the inroads these made 



poses. Maids of Honor are different from 
ordinary patty-pan tarts in, being made 
of fine pun paste, which rises high in the 
pans. 

Took puff paste, left over from dinner 
pastry, rolled out thm, cut out with a 
fancy scollop-edge cutter, large as the 
top of a coffee cup, and pressed the fiats 
into shallow gem pans. Put a teaspoon- 
ful of lemon honey (506) — called lemon 
cheese cake by the English — in each; 
baked in a slack oven; took out just be- 
fore the "cheesecake" began to boil over 
the edges and spoil the appearance. 
Served on small pastry plates, four in 
each set, at intervals down the table. 



506— Lemon Butter; or Paste; 
Cheesecake; or Lemon Honey. 



or 



A world-wide favorite made of— 

I cup sugar— 8 ounces. 

Slemons. 

Butter, size of an egg— 2 ounces. 

4 to 6 yolks or 3 whole eggs— not par- 
ticular. 

Put the sugar, butter and grated rinds 
and juice into a saucepan and boil, add 
the yolks and stir until it becomes thick. 

It looks like cold honey when it is 
cold. May be kept for weeks. Is good 
to spread jelly cakes with and to fill tart- 
lets and eclairs. It is seldom worth while 
to make less than double the above 
amount. 



had all been there, there would only 
have been just provisions enough. 



The Art of Charging Enough. 



June 26. This morning I asked the 
proprietor of the Hotel D'Arlington : 

"Have you any objection to telling me 
what you charged for last night's sup- 
per?" 

"What would you have charged?" he 
returned, with the complacent smile of 
one who knows how. 

While I was figimng on a dollar a 
plate and not knowing what was to be 
done about the odd number and the 
absentees, he added: 

"I charged them twenty dollars for the 
supper and there was a profit on wine 
and cigars, and they were pleased and 
satisfied. If it had been a partj of our 
town boys from the college I might have 
had to take seventy-five cents a plate, 
but these actors would have gone away 
thinking they had been treated in a 
second-class manner if I had charged 
them less— and I do not work for 
nothing." 

"A very close friend of mine lost his 
chance of a fortune in the restaurant 
business some years ago through not 
knowing how to charge enough." 

"It is a very essential thing to know in 
our business. 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



"Yes. He took a place and went on 
serving the best that was to be obtained 
in a superior style on a sort ot ten-per- 
cent profit plan until all the one-horse 
eating houses around him closed, one 
after the other and he had all the trade." 

"And then he raised his prices!" 

"No." 

"He was a fool." 

"Yes. And went on doing more bus- 
iness and working harder and making 
less money, until — " 

"He took sick?" 

"No. But a man who knew how to 
charge five dollars for a two-and-a-half 
supper came along, bought him out easy, 
stepped in and made a few thousands 
without ever taking his gl()ves off, as it 
were." 

"Now, that is not the way to look at 
the matter. The man who charged five 
dollars for a two-and-a-half supper did 
quite right and just what a portion of the 
public wanted him to do. Thev that 
paid it paid two-and-a-half for exclusive- 
ness. They paid a price that Tom, 
Dick and Harry could not pay, purpose- 
ly that those three objectionable persons 
might be kept out ; and, they paid it for 
better table-wear, finer furnishings and 
better service. 

There is a vast amount of working for 
nothing in the ordinary boarding busi- 
ness. Great apparent profits would turn 
out to be dead loss in many cases if all 
the principals were paid as exactly as the 
hired helpers are. Summer boarding- 
house keepers will tend a garden four 
months in advance, turn the products 
into the boarding-house and count so 
much more made because they have no 
vegetables and fruits to buy when if they 
paid themselves for their gardening they 
would come out in debt. 

Such might even be the case with such 
an apparently renumerative supper as 
that previously detailed, and this will ex- 

{)lain why persons never become sudden- 
y rich by setting up to furnish parties to 
order, and why they cannot afford to be 
cheap in their charges, and why, more- 
over, hotel-keepers themselves seldom 
make any profit on any suppers or ban- 
quets that are beyond the easy capacity 
of their own establishment without out- 
side help. If a little extra supp>er in a 
hotel requires the attendance until a late 



hour of three waiters, a pantr37man or 
girl, and a dishwasher, the proprietor is 
not ordinarily expected to pay extra for 
such service, because, hirmg by the 
month some accommodation is looked 
for from the help as an offset to the 
times of dull business when there is little 
to do, but the pay goes on all the same. 
But if these had to he specially hired for 
the occasion the cost would be one dol- 
lar each in most places, and half that 
amount in the very cheapest. A first- 
class cook in New York or Saratoga, if 
called in to prepare a private party can 
generally obtain ten dollars a day for 
his services. Ordir\arly, a first-class 
caterer in any city, having such cooks in 
his employ charges for their services 
when they are sent out about %k a day, 
and about such a rate the hotel-keeper 
would have to pay if he had not his own 
cook to command. Add then the cost 
of gas, of fires, the hire of dishes and 
tableware, hire of express wagon and 
a hand to go to and tro, pack and un- 
pack, the washing of napkms and table 
cloths and other like incidentals and the 
anticipated profits from even the finest 
ball supper may delusively vanish before 
you know how it all happened — unless 
you rush in slowly and know how to 
charge enough. 



508— A School Commencement Straw- 
berry and Ice Cream Supper. 

June 26. The supper ordered for to- 
night is a very different affair from that 
of the actors. It is for some professors 
and teachers but mostly for girl graduates 
who are not hotel boarders. It is con- 
demed in advance as an affair that will 
be more bother than it is worth; that 
will not pay a cent; but, that must be 
accepted for the sake of popularity in the 
town. Perhaps it will turn out more 
profitable than is anticipated. It is to be 
fifty cents a plate for ail who eat except 
five musicians who are fi^e. There is a 
guarantee of forty persons with a possi- 
bility of seventy-five. Orders to provide 
for fifty and take the chances on more 01 
less; to make nothing expensive and not 
lose any more on the party than was ab- 
solutely unavoidable 

The bill-of-fare:

$11 43 

Sixty-nine persons partook of the sup- 
per of whom sixty-four paid fifty cents 
each — $32. There was quite enough of 
everything^ and nothing left; the only 
thing requuring to be eked out by a plan 
of dishmg up light was the ice cream. 
The only freezer m the house held nom- 
inally eight quarts. Five quarts of pure 
cream put in increased to seven quarts in 
freezing and was all the freezer would 
hold. Among the best things to make 
for such an occasion are the coffee cakes 
referred to. These were made like split 
rolls in shape, then the edges notched 
with a knife to make what the boys call 
"dog-toes," then set to rise. They open 



up in baking, are rich looking and when 
brushed over with syrup and dredged 
with sugar are the showiest things on the 
table. 



509— Sandwiches of Devilled Ham. 



A twenty-five cent can of the devilled 
ham S9ld m the stores will spread 50 thin 
sandwiches. Sandwiches are never good 
unless they are thin. There should be a 
very sharp knife used and an effort to 
try how thinly the bread can be sliced. 
Spread one slice with butter the other 
with ham, put them together and cut ofif 
the edges smooth and even.

with a regular bill-of-fare. 

Mr. Farewell has invented and manu- 
factures the only successful fire escape and 
in the course of the business has learned 
a good deal about hotels. He formerly 
bad a "shooting box" at the lake where 
he would pass an occasional week, then 
as the lakeshore became settled up he 
built a house to bring his family to for a 
few days. Then he built another in 
which they could live all summer. Then 
came all the relatives and friends and 
business acquaintances who respected 
Mr. Farewell, and he built still another 
house, wherein they could pass the sum- 
mer, too. But it is very likely that at 
the end of last summer^s pleasure the 
hostess quit pretty tired. I don't know 
what she said, but the fact is, that this 
year Mr. Farewell starts in with a regular 
hotel register a regular manager, 
a regular housekeeper, a regu- 
lar cook and a bran new omnibus. I am 
afraid it will not pay him in cash, but he 
will get i^eace, rest and pleasure for his 
family at a less cost than neretofore. 

So, this is the kitchen; a summer 
kitchen, truly; not ceiled, with plain 
boards for a floor. I am glad it is so, 
for there are no hotel advantages to be 
counted. 1*11 bet it is just like all the 
rest of the summer boarding house 
kitchens, on both sides of the lake, just 



COOKING liOR PROFIT, 



like the Trulirural House, over on the 

gjint ; just like Swibob's on the right and 
amacle's on the left. Yes, it is good 
enough. 

And this is the stove, a number 14 or 
16, or thereabout ; and this is the cook's 
hot water tank — a big tin teakettle — the 
reservoir being for soft-water for the 
dishwashing. I suppose there has been 
many a fine meal cooked for a hundred 
or more on smaller stoves than this, and 
teakettle cookery is not so bad in some 
places. Anjrway, it is as good as all the 
rest and the stove has an immense oven. 
The Palmer House at the depot has a 
fair-sized range and a new 30 inch broiler 
arrived for it on the last train, but we 
are not a laige house like that. 



510— The Question of How Many Fires. 



There is a wonderful disproportion in 
some hotels between the size of the fur- 
nishins^s and appliances and the results 
they are intended to secure. One of the 
best fitted-up, most city-like country 
hotels I know of, is the Devereux House 
in tj;^e city of Pandora, State of Cornu- 
copia, but it is also keeping up one of 
the silliest pieces of extravagance in run- 
ning seven fires in the kitchen for the 
cooking for generally forty and never 
more than fifty persons; the proprietor at 
the same time paying $6 a cord for wood 
and fifteen cents a bushel for charcoal 
and pinching and saving in all other 
ways to make both ends meet. As some 
readers will be puzzled to see how so 
many fires can exist in one small kitchen 
at once, we will give a diagram to show :

I — Hard place for the hand that keeps 
up all the fires. 

JTJ — Kitchen table; K meat block; 
L dead line for help. 

The reason why they use so many 
fires to feed 40 or 50 people is that once 
upon a time, long years ago, the house 
used to contain 150 people and the fires 
were not too many; the trade went away 
but still, like the Aztecs, they keep up 
the sacred fires. 

Now here is the other ejrtreme : 



SUMMER 




KITCHEN, 



A— One large cook stove. 

B — Big broiling hearth and gridiron to 
same. 

C— Hot water reservoir and tin dish- 
closet under. 

D — Meat block. 

E— Kitchen table. 

F — Dead line for help. 

T— Tea kettle. 

We all like plenty of conveniences, a 
place for everj^hing, and I am not going 
to make an arcument against plenty of 
range room. Tnere must be a medium, 
however, somewhere between these two 
pictures. This stove is to serve for some 
number unknown except that it will 
never exceed fifty. How well I remem- 
ber the splendid and plentiful dinners 
that usea to be cookea for as many as 
from 150 to 300 people on those little up- 
river steamboats at this very low-water 
time of year, on light six-foot ranges that 
we could almost carry around. More 
than half had to be done by steaming, 
because the ovens were so small. Half- 
a-dozen entrees would be well cooked 
over the ash-pan full of coals with the 



gridiron upon them. Right now, there 
IS the City of Fremont of the Lake Su- 
perior line setting a magnificent table for 
large numbers, though her kitchen 
(caboose) is little more than a cupboard ; 
the range one of the smallest ; the pastry 
room positively too small for a man to 
stretch his arms to pull off a coat. And 
still they prepare all sorts of delicacies 
in it. "There is more m the man than 
there is in the land."

511— German Fried Potatoes. 



ers 



This is the name the restaurant keep- 
have given to the family style of 
cooking potatoes. Boil potatoes with 
their jackets on then peel and cut in 
thick slices into a large frying pan. Put 
in drippings, or butter, or the fat from 
fried pork enough only to well grease the 
pan ; let the potatoes have plenty of time 
to brown on one side then shake them 
over till they are nicely colored all 
through. Sprinkle with salt. 

512— Plain Baked Custard. 



?uickest and easiest of all puddings. 
00k 6 cups milk (4^ cents) 

10 eggs (12 J4 cents) 

I cup of sugar (4 cents) 

Grating of nutmeg. 

Beat all together with a wire egg 
beater, pour into an earthern dish and 
bake. Be careful to take it out as soon as 
it is set, as too long baking causes it to 
break and turn watery. Should be eaten 
cold. No sauce needed.

It is best when freshly made. The 
ham should be sliced and then mmced 
and served up as soon as it b hot, before 
it turns to a dark color. Took the lasc 
Itran trimmings of the boiled ham that 
would not make slices, iS), 18 cents, 
minced fine. Put in saucepan, butter, 
I cent, and large spoonful water, put in 
the ham and let get hot but not fry. 
Season with black pepper only. Made 
12 thin slices of toast of one-half loaf 
bread, 23^ cents. Spread a spoonful of 
minced ham evenly on the toast as called 
for. 

514— Potatoes Baked in Milk. 



A third of a peck of potatoes, 4 cents, 
pared and cut m thick slices raw into a 
tin baking pan. Added part of a green 
onion, a teaspoon salt, butter, i cent, 
and two quarts milk, 6 cents, and put in 
when the fire was first made, baked 
slowly until the milk was dried down 
like cream and brown on top. 



515— Baking Powder Biscuits. 

The lady before referred to, who keeps 
a boarding house under difficulties, did 
not take kindly to my wav of making 
biscuits, it oeems too dear; but, I should 
like to talk it over with her. In the first 
place, there is so much difference be- 
tween the cheapness of all sorts of bread 
and vegetable food and the deamess of 
meat, that we cannot take too much 
pains to make the breads good in order 
that they may be eaten and the meat 
saved. Then in places where one man 



cook has to do as much as four of Mrs. 
Tingee's girls put together and be ready 
every time without excuses, the differ- 
ence in time saved between our method 
of pouring in the butter or lard in a 
melted state and adding the milk or 
water to it and so getting them mingled 
with the flour instantly, and the other 
slow way of rubbing the cold shortening 
into the dry flour with the hands, be- 
comes quite an object. But I do not 
recommend anybody to make baking 
powder bread or biscuit an)rway, only 
for convenience. It is dear and not 
nearly so good as yeast-raised bread and 
rolls. This is the way : 

2 quarts or pounds flour (7 centsj 

6 teaspoons, rounded up, baking 
powder (4 cents) 

Yz cup soft butter or laid (4 cents) 

Little salt 

2 cups milk (2 cents) or water. 

Mix the powder in the flour by rapid 
stirring around. Pour in the shortenmg 
in a hollow made in the middle and the 
milk (not too cold, else it will set the 
shortening in lumps) and mix up soft. 
Press the dough together on the table 
and when worked tolerably smooth let it 
stand a minute or two and it will roll 
out better. Makes about two dozen 
biscuits, according to size. 

516— The Round of Beef for Steak. 



We are going to get our meats from 
Basswood City by express twice a week 
or as needed, and our fresh fish from 
VVhitefish Bay the same way. There are 
some fishes in Uintah Lake, but they 
will not come out when wanted, so we 
have to send further. When I was at 
Basswood I found the steward of the 
new Memphremagog House at that 
place was buying selected round of beef 
instead of loin for steaks. Not the com- 
mon round steaks which the butchers 
cut straight along good and bad together, 
but the tender side only, cut off the bone 
as neat and trim as a ham. I had pre- 
viously written up and advocated the use 
of the tender side of the round instead ol 
the most expensive short loins, but had 
in view the case of siich hotels as Black's, 
the other rival house here at the depot, 
where they have ninety summei 
boarders, at $10 a week, and still buy 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



10 



their beef by the entire side at a time, 
hind-quarter, fore-quarter, neck, shanks 
and everything. But the getting the 
butcher to cut out the best piece of 
round for a house every day was new to 
me. The tough side of the round, of 
which there is a portion in every whole 
round steak, is about one third of it. 
Hovv the butcher disposed of that does 
not concern us, but he charged the 
steward for the other 13 cents a pound. 
The choice cut of the loin at the same 
time was costing i^ cents and one-fourth 
of it was bone. Twenty pounds of loin 
at 15 cents comes to $3. Take out the 
bone and you have fifteen pounds of 
meat that has cost 20 cents, a clear dif- 
ference of $7 on every hundred pounds 
of beef bought. This meat is not as 
good as the best parts of the loin but it 
ranks second best, and is better than the 
flank part which every loin cut carries. 
The drawback is a piece of the sinewy 
end of the round, about three or four 
pounds that become tough and dry and 
has to be cut off to make either corned 
beef or soup. 

There are plenty of people to whom 
one beefsteak seems as gooa as another, 
they are so hungry it makes no differ- 
ence; but, at the same time there are 
others whom we like to pamper with 
choice bits, and besides, we are loth to 
lose the rich loin bone for soup, so I 
called on the butcher and arranged that 
he shall send a round and a lorn alter- 
nately, and that promises to be good | 
enough. While that is on the way we | 
shall have to pick up something at ''The 
Glen," where the village butcher kills 
something once or twice a week, or 
whenever he has nothing else to do. 

517— A Meat Block. 



shape and divide the tender from the 
tough and cut out the superfluous bones 
for the soup boiler. There is no roal 
economy in the use of meat possible 
without selection. Our manager has 
been over to " The Glen." He does not 
know one piece of meat from another 
and is proud to say so, because he is a 
college graduate and is going to be a 
lawyer, and he has brought back some 
beefsteak that nobody can eat. It 
would require a person to have cast-iron 
jaws. Round steaks cut low down on 
the leg of a very tough old ox. But we 
must do something with it and the wood- 
man must saw off the butt of a tree for a 
block. 



There is as yet no meat block in the 
kitchen, but one must be procured soon. 
The block,the same as all butchers have, 
but small, is the first sign of the differ- 
ence between professional cookery and 
poor Mary Jane's fried victuals. It is 
all Greek talking about selecting choice 
parts of meat to those who don't know 
the use or see the need of having a meat 
block. It is part of a cook's trade to 
know how to select and he must have a 
block to saw and chop upon, to trim and

520— A Bill of Groceries and the Cost. 



We are now to make out an order* and 
send to Lakeport for a store-room stock 
of groceries. The great exjjenses are 
going to be for perishable provisions, for 
meat, butter, eggs, cream, milk, fruits 
and such things as people go to the coun- 
try expecting to enjoy m abundance. 
Besides those there is a bewildering lot 
of articles to be always on hand and it 
saves a great deal worry and a good 
many forced journeys to get them to- 
gether all at once. The hostess laughs 
when this is mentioned, saying she has 
always been in the habit of looking 
through a cook book when this ordering 
was to be done, to be reminded of things 
that would be wanted. This time, how- 
ever, we will dispense with the cook 
book lest it lead us to order articles that 
would not be needed once in a year. 
The following is what we ordered and 
the prices they cost. The calculation 
was fbr one month's supply with the ex- 
pectation of a big business to be done — 
for a house of this size :

dipped in melted butter to prevent stick-

523— Potato Cakes or Pats. 



All cold mashed potatoes can be used 
by pressing them into little pats like bis- 
cuits with plenty of flour on the outside 
and browning first one side and then the 
other in a trying-pan with very little 
drippings or butter. It is one of the 
most popular ways of serving potatoes. 



"It is a pretty good supper bill-of- 
fare, but wnat makes the codfish in 
cre;^m so dark?"' 

That is what the chief cook of the 
New Hebrides Hotel wanted to know 
when he stopped one night on his travels 
— not at this house where cream is plenty 
but at the Sapolio City House. No doubt 
but he makes it sq himself and thinks it 
is quite a luxury, but very few do. One 
trouble was, the milk was skimmed milk 
and half water, besides, and wouldn't 
looklike cream under any circumstances, 
and, to make it worse the codfish had 
never been steeped to freshen and 
whiten it. If the fish has been forgotten 
over-night put it in a large pot of cold 
water as soon as you remember it and 
let it slowly get warm over a slack fire. 
Before it becomes hot enough to cook it 
pour away that salt water and fill up 
again with cold and do as before, 
and the third time let it boil 
up. ' Pick it apart in cold water and it 
will not only be fresh enough but quite 
white. Put It in a saucepan with good 
milk, a little butter, add a very little 
flour, thickening when it boils. 



525— Pickerel Fried irr Butter. 



July 3. Breakfast. 

The early boys caught something this 
time : rose at four and coaxed two ^ 4-H) 
pickerel out of the lake. There is as 
yet no lard, no meat fat, bacon nor pork 
to fry them in; might be broiled, but 
conclude to fry in bntter sparingly. Cut 
in thin slices crosswise of the fish, pep- 
per and salt well, dip both sides in flour. 
Put into the frying pans only a little 
butter and fry the pieces on both sides. 
The pieces are cut thin to cook this way 
because butter browns and burns too 
easily to let thick slices get done 
through. Take up on a hot pan to drain. 
Send m as soon after cooking as possible.

526— The Refrigerator Question. 



"Our first expressed lot of meat will 
arrive at noon ; what is to be done with 
it to keep it? The cellar is as 
warm as out of doors and a good deal 
worse. New milk put down there at 
night sours before morning. A ham of 
the janitor's is covered with blue mold 
and is sticky to the touch, and salt and 
saltpetre on the shelf are trickling away 
in moisture, besides, the floor is muddy 
and the steps are broken down — are the 
other summer resorts around Uintah 
Lake no better fixed — Swibob's and 
Barnacle's and the Trulirural House?" 

"Oh, that's all right; we are going to 
have a good refrigerator." 

"What, right away, to be built now, 
in July?" 

*'Why, yes ; as quick as the Fourth is 
over the men are ready to come. We 
waited for you to show them what is 
wanted. You chalk out the plan for an 
ice house and we can get plenty of ice to 
fill it." 

The greater number of refrigerators 
put up for hotels and similar houses are 
milures through so few people under- 
stdnding really what is needed until they 
have learned by dear experience. A re- 
frigerator must be dry as well as cold, 
not steaming and with the clammy mois- 
ture of a cellar. It is often a good 
scheme where such a humid vault has 
nearly spoiled the meat in one day to 
take the meat out and hang it in the 
open air wrapped in a sheet and so keep 
it a week longer. Such a failure of a 
refrigerator as that, is a positive damage 
instead of benefit. 

It should be conveniently located 
where it can be entered every few min- 
utes, if necessary, without a long journey 
or a chmbing of steps each time, if it is 
not, a great part of the benefits of having 
a perfect refrigerator are lost. And then 
it should be so constructed that the very 



frequent opening and\ shutting of the 
door will not have the effect of driving a 
warm blast through the mass of ice and 
unduly wasting it besides keeping the 
interior of the refriprerator always warm. 
To meet all requirements some houses 
have several remgeracors, each for a 
special use. There is the Tremont 
House at the other end of the avenue 
with perhaps a dozen, of all sizes, from

Plan of a iarge hotel's cold atore rooms, front a lew 

These are rooms of good size, say 6x10 
and 6 feet high divided from each other; 
doors opening in front, with one large ice 
room above ; all ventilated and drained 
and forming one gjeat ice house with 
double walls filled with pulverized char- 
coal. Thb is built in a dry basement. 

Out at the Bubbling Springs House 
they have a good ice house "that is made 
to serve for many purposes, and it is 
built out of doors, just four steps from 
the kitchen door and therefore quite 
handy. It is good because it is well 
constructed with thick double walls 
well filled in and is roomy, perhaps 10 
xio inside. It is a two-story building, 
the ice chamber being above; the ice 
blocks resting upon a frame of oak scant- 
ling. A zinc-covered floor leads off the 
water; the communication with the room 
below is hy af)ertures along the sides of 
the floor. The roof is flat and covered 
deep with gravel. A spreading cedar 
tree partly protects it from the sun'o rays. 
The defects of this ice house are these : 
It is but one room and it is the one re- 
frii^erator that must be used for every- 
thing. When the door is open the entire 
refrigerator is open and the hot summer

air rushes up into the ice chamber — and 
the dcx)r is opened every few minutes 
through the day. Then it has no win- 
dow, and the cook having excellent 
reasons for keeping his meat block with- 
in it and cutting the meats there must 
keep the door open while at work. It is 
more than probable that several hun- 
dreds pounds of meat and tons of ice are 
lost every summer through the general 
unhandiness and incompleteness of the 
refrigerating arrangements. A very bad 
break of this sort exists at the Balbriggan 
House, where the arrangements are gen- 
erally very good, and a seemingly perfect 
square room refrigerator, with ice cham- 
ber above, as in the preceeding speci- 
men, stands conveniently at one end of 
the kitchen. But when the carpenter 
work on this one was nearly finished, it 
happened that no sawdust could be ob- 
tained. As it was winter time there was 
no immediate need experienced ; the re- 
frigerator was finished up without either 
sawdust or charcoal being filled in the 
double wall and it remains so still, serv- 
ing as a receptacle to melt away from 
two to three tons of ice each week with 
very little effect in cooling anything in 
the heated season. 

These one-room refiigerators are, how- 
ever, not the sort to have unless there 
can be more than one-or two of them in 
a house, each devoted to a different pur- 
pose. 

The great International Cafe had to 
undergo two changes of proprietors and 
be partly remodeled within before it ever 
became the successful restaurant where 
elaborate little meals made up of the 
most diverse orders of viands could be 
obtained in a reasonably short time after 
the order was given. There being no 
room and no calculations made in the 
building for a convenient refrigerator 
a number of small ice boxes were first 
resorted to, set in all sorts of out of the 
way comers, one holding one thing and 
another something else, and it often 
happened that every one of them would 
have CO be visited before the required 
articles were put together. A cook can 
perhaps travel twelve miles up and down 
stairs in twelve hours or sixteen miles 
through several halls and passages and 
back again in sixteen hours if he is re- 
quired to do so, but he cannot cook 



many dinners at the same time. 

Thus it was when the waiters would 
come rushing into the kitchen singing : 
"Hey ; where's my order? Where's the 
cook?'' The vegetable woman would 
answer: "The cook? he's gone a travel- 
ing down to the big ice box and when he 
gets there he'll go excavating through the 
ice to find something, but I guess he'll 
be back in half an hour." 

When the source of trouble at length 
became fully understood at the Interna- 
tional Cafe, something was pulkd down 
and a refrigerator half as long as the 
kitchen was puilt along the wall opposite 
the range with so many compartments 
that it was hardly possible for an oider to 
come that the material could not be 
found in one of these drawers. Since 
that time, instead of one cook and a 
losing business, the cafe has kept six or 
eight busy, and had a profitable career.

In all cases the construction ought to 
be planned in view of the fact that cold 
air descends and warm air rises In the 
specimen above marked out the pro- 
visions do not come in contact with the 
ice. The long box at top is filled with 
broken ice and has a zinc floor and the 
drawers slide in and are cooled from 
above through slits in the zinc so made 
that the water cannot drip through. Of 
course, like all ice boxes, the walls are 
double and the lid which is drawn up by 
means of a rope and pulley is the same. 



rs 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



The common square ice box filled 
with broken ice is also a good keeper of 
fish and similar kinds of provisions that 
are not injured by water. Put frogs' legs, 
lamb's fries, brook trout and a few such 
articles in muslin bags and bury them in 
the ice and they keep a long time and 
can be withdrawn easily when wanted ; 
but, with that the usefulness of such a 
box ends, for meat is injured by being 
kept wet and by being washed after lying 
on ice, and pans set on top of ice are set 
in the wrong place, they should be be- 
neath it. 

In order that it may be clearly seen 
how much is required of a hotel refrigera- 
tor for all purposes let us look at the in- 
ventory of the contents of one for 
one day. There are : 

Beef loins and roasts— always keeping 
a supply ahead to allow it to improve by 
keeping and become tender. 

Cut meats and small meats — pans of 
steaks, chops and sliced ham, loin of 
veal, mutton, lamb, liver, etc., all car- 
ried in warm. 

Brine keg for corned beef and tongues 
— it must stand in a cold place or the 

Eickle will spoil in the course of three 
ot days ana all the newly added [meat 
with it. 

Butter — oneiar at least, for cooking, 
and probably the table butter likewise. 

Lard — a can put in in a melted state. 

Yeast — a jar just made and brought in 
warm. 

Milk and cream — the cans warm from 
the dairy wagon and the milk pans from 
the kitcnen for the milk to be poured in, 
all brought in to be made cold. 

Fruit and melons — they will not be fit 
for the table unless cooled. 

Ham and corned beef for supper— just 
out of the broiler and brought m smok- 
ing hot. 

Roast meats left from dinner— brought 
in warm from the carving table also 
gravies and sauces, a dish of fish and 
plates of croquettes or other side dishes 
to be saved for another day. 

Potatoes cooked to be ready to slice 
up for breakfast, dishes of peas and com, 
half a pudding, some cooked codfish, a 
dozen bunches of celery, two or three 
pies. 

These things and more brought in for 
this meal and soon taken out for the 



next cause the ice house door to be al- 
ways in motion. 

Some reader will say this thing or that 
shall not be put in, but managed some 
other way, but it is futile fighting 
against the inevitable. Perhaps a gallon 
of boiling hot mush will be stopped at 
the door and forbidden to be put in; 
but, will be lelt on the kitchen table and 
never be cold enough to slice and fry in 
the morning and so next night the re- 
frigerator will catch it. That is what it 
is for. There should be a good one and 
large, if only one is to be built. 



527~A Good Hotel Refrigerator^ 



The annexed diagram explaining the 
form and construction of a refrisjerator 
that was found to meet all the require- 
ments at a certain popular hotel, was 
printed some time ago m "Hotel Meat 
Cooking" since when I have heard of 
two or three hotel keepers, who could 
be named, having built refrigerators in 
their houses after Ithat pattern and they 
approve it. It seems advisable therefore 
to reproduce it here, as it is at least a 
safe pattern and not like a thing untried. 
The dimensions might be varied to suit. 

This gives a front view as the interior 
appears when the doors are open. The 
height inside is six feet ; depth, ft-ont to 
back, five and a half j the middle com- 
partment for the ice is three feet wide ; 
the cold rooms on each side three and a 
half. The drip from the ice is led away 
by a zinc drainer, and the space below 
is both dry and cold. The outside walls 
are, of course, double, and filled in with 
ei^ht inches of dry sawdust. This re- 
fir^erator is built close by the outer door 
on one side of a cellar basement, the 
storeroom being directly opposite. It is 
elevated a step or two from the door.

says Mr. Farewell, "how much ice will 
it take?'* 

"You will require two tons a week, be- 
cause, out of the same stock of ice the 
Ice-pitchers will be filled, ice cream 
made, and ice for the various other 
needs taken. An ordinary two-horse 
wason bed full is about a ton of blocks 
of ice."

Shelves. 

One of the two rooms can be used to 
hang joints of meats upon hooks set un- 
der the shelves and be opened only at 
long intervals while the other side used 
for various purposes may have the door 
in almost constant swing, and instead of 
letting a warm blast be forced through 
the ice every time the door is banged, a 
self-acting spring door over the aperature 
D closes with the momentary pressure. 

Milk and butter easily take the flavors 
of other articles of provision such as 
onions and celerv, stored with them; 
hence, the use of naving a special com- 
partment for them in the refrigerator. 

It is, unfortunately, a very common 
supposition that the cellar is the best 
place for the refrigerator, while, on the 
contrary, it is generally the very worst. 
A halt-cellar or basement partly above 
ground and with a free circulation of air, 
IS likely to be the best; and, yet, some 
of the cooling rooms, which it is a pleas- 
ure to enter, where everything has the 
cool, fresh and solid appearance of a dry 
winter's day, though the mercury outside 
has climbed up into the nineties, are built 
in recesses left for them in the walls of 
the buildings on the same levels as the 
dining room and kitchen.

Only about half the people anywhere 
will order liver when there is an alter-

Cut about 8 thin slices, which will be 
little over half a pound. Lay theni in a 
frying pan with some drippings or bacon 
fat and fry brown on both sides. Season 
with salt and pepper while cooking. 
Take up the liver and put into the pan a 
heaping lablespoonful of flour and when 
that has been stirred around, a cupful ot 
hot water. Let boil up and strain over 
the liver. 

530— How To Bake Potatoes. 



there is no better way than baking or 
roasting either for ootatoes that cost five 
for a cent or large truffles that cost five 
dollars each. Pick out the largest and 
smoothest potatoes to bake because any 
size will do to pare and mash and even 
if a person should waste part of a too 
large one on his plate it would slill be 
the cheapest dish of the meal. After 
washing well cut off the ends of the 
potatoes. It may not make them any 
mealier, although some suppose it does; 
but, it makes them look better, and as if 
they had been cared for. Put them in 
the oven as a rule just one hour before 
the meal. When done instead of sliding 
them into a hot closet or under the stove 
to become dry and worthless, take up 
each one in a damp] towel in the hand 
and press it gently together and after 
that cover the pan containing them with 
the same damp cioth and keep them 
warm. 



531— Molasses Pound Cake. 



Though there are fifty other good ways 



This will be found quite an acquisition 
to the list of cheap and easy cakes: 
I cup sugar, small — 6 ounces. 
I cup butter — 6 ounces. 
I cup molasses — 12 ounces. 

1 cup milk. 

2 eggs. 

6 cups flour — ji^ pounds. 

I teaspoon each of ground ginger and 
*-innamon. 

Make the butter soft and mix it and 
sugar, m9lasses, milk, eggs, and spices 
together in a pan. Mix the powder in 
the flour, then stir that in and beat up 
thoroughly. Bake in two small cake 
moulds. Makes 3 lbs @ 9 cents a 
pound. 

This cake can and ought to be made 
with a cup of sour milk instead of sweet, 
and a teaspoon of soda instead of the 
ijowder— only sour milk is not always at 
hand to use. 

532— French Rolls. 

As a rule a pound of light dough 
makes 10 rolls of such a size that most 
persons take two at a meal; but, as it 
to.kes half a pound of liquid to make 
dough of one pound of flour if we have 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



i8 



three pounds of dough and make thirty 
rolls of it they contain only 2 pounds of 
flour, costing, probably, 7 cents. The 
cost is increased by a few enriching in- 
gredients and the yeast. To make 
10 or 12 rolls out of a pound of dough, 
however, we must raise them as light 
and large as it is possible to do, like the 
best baker's buns for lightness, only bet- 
ter eating, and we have no calculations 
made for poor Mary Jane's squatty little 
lumps of Qough that she calls rolls. It 
seems so easy to make fine rolls, es- 
pecially with the compiessed yeast that 
nas of late years come into general use 
that the wonder is how anybody can 
make bad ones even if they try. Gen- 
erally the failure seems to be owing to 
not using enough yeast, not setting the 
dough in a suitable place to rise and not 
giving the rolls time to become as light 
as they might be in the pans before 
baking. I think if those who keep 
boarders could know what an advantage 
this cheap luxury of fine rolls is to a 
house — even to the extent of bringing a 
higher price for board — there would be a 
general cultivation of the art Of domestic 
bread making. It does no good to make 
fine rolls only once in a while and miss 
the mark twice as often; and, perhaps 
that is where the difficulty lies, the con- 
stant care to do always the same way at 
different times being so hard to exer- 
cise. 

1 am asked "Do you put eggs in the 
rolls,'* and the answer is no — not in the 
every day kind that is good enough for 
anybody all the year round ; but, there 
are varieties of rolls of different degrees 
of richness that are made with eggs, such 
as butter rolls and tea cakes. It is not 
so much what they contain as the way 
the dough is managed that makes them 
good. Take : 

2 quarts or pounds, or 8 cups flour. 
2 large cups sweet milk (water will do.) 
I cent's worth compressed yeast. 
I tablespoon sugar. 
|4 tablespoon salt. 
Butter or lard size of an egg — 2 

ounces. 

If the rolls are for 6 o'clock supper, 
any time in the forenoon will do to mix 
the dough. Noon is a good time in 

summer. Make a hollow in the flour, 

dissolve the yeast in the milk and pour I he 



it in, add the sugar, salt and half the 
shortening, stir up into stiff dough, turn 
it out on the table and work it well with 
the knucklej. ^ Slightly grease the bot- 
tom of the mixing pan which you have 
scraped out clean, press the lump of 
dough down into the greased pan and 
turn the greased side up— which prevents 
a crust drying on the dough while it is 
rising and helps the appearance of the 
rolls. Then set the pan on an upper 
shelf where it will be warm and let stay 
there until 3 o'clock. At that time work 
the dough on the table again and put it 
back to rise another hour or more. 

Work the dough again with the 
knuckles, roll it out to a thin sheet. 
Brush over with the remaining butter or 
lard melted, cut out with an oval cutter, 
double over, place in a pan far enough 
apart not to touch, rise an hour and 
bake in a hot oven about eight or ten 
minutes. Brush over with clear warm 
water when done. 

Mrs. Tingee looked incredulous when 
I told her to bake these rolls only 8 or 10 
minutes— thought they would not be well 
baked but they will. Had to explain 
that the lighter an article is the quicker 
it bakes— that a souffle or meringne may 
be done through in three minutes ; a per- 
fect sponge cake will bake in 20 minutes 
because it is light and full of air 
spaces while a fruit cake of the same 
size requires 2 hours. Rolls are spoiled 
by dry baking. Hotel cooks have their 
ovens hot, hotter, hotest. 

There is a patent roll cutter made and 
for sale, which forms the rolls of the right 
shape and makes the depression across the 
middle to fold them over by. The size 
of the rolls may be governed by the 
thickness or thinness to which the sheet 
of dough is rolled. In order that these 
or any sort of rolls may have a good reg- 
ular shape it is necessary after the dough 
has been kneaded and rolled, to let it 
alone a few minutes while you get pans 
ready or do something else that it may 
lose the elasticity which causes it to puii 
back out of proper form. 

533— About Compressed Yeast. 



There are but few towns now where 
compressed yeast cannot be obtained, 
' express senice being so nearly uni- 



19 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



versal. Thb yeast is a great saver of 
time and trouble. Although the ex- 
pense of purchasing it may amount to 
several dollars during a season at a resort 
it is money well spent if there is anv busi- 
ness done worth counting at all. It 
comes in cakes wrapped in tin-foil which 
retail at 2 cents or 5 cents, according 
to size. Will keep about a week in cool 
weather or in a refrigerator, but should 
be obtained from the manufacturers 
frcoh every day or two if possible. It is 
the quickest kmd of yeast, as by using 
a double quantity good rolls and bread 
can be made ana baked within three or 
four hours. To use it take half a cake 
or more, crumble it mto tepid milk or 
water and let it dissolve, then pour all 
into the flour. Those who cannot obtain 
the compressed yeast, or who object to 
the expense of it can find full directions 
for making yeast of the best and strongest 
liquid sort at Nos. 257 and 258.

134— Potatoes Stewed i.r*. Cream. 



Variously called stewed potatoes, 
minced potatoes in cream, and other 
ways, and a favorite way with many 
people. Take cold cooked potatoes, 
slice them as thin as possible into a stew 
pan, pour in good milk to come up even 
with the sliced potatoes and set over the 
fire. While it is heating, chop the po- 
tatoes small with a knife point, add salt, 
butter and cream, according as can be 
afforded. When made as most people 



like them these are almost as thick as 
mashed potatoes. 

535— blabber Batter Cakes. 



About the easiest, quickest made and 
best batter cakes, are made with only 
four ingredients, viz-, "clabber," or milk 
curdled by souring, flour, soda and salt. 

Take a little sifted flour in a pan, 
add the "clabber" until it can be stirred 
to the proper consistency to bake on a 
griddle, then add a little salt and soda. 
There is no measure to give only that in 
a general way 2 cups of sour milk needs i 
teaspoon of soda. 

When you make other flour batter 
caKes, syrup, eggs and shortening are 
needed — the syrup to make them brown 
easily — but these "clabber" cakes need 
nothing but what is named above. 

This is the Fourth, the great excursion 
day. Flags are flying at the large hotels 
at the depot and at the Trulirural House. 
There is some danger that a few of the 
straggling excursionists may come to bur 
house to dinner and we are not prepared. 
Stores have not arrived ; scarcely a thing 
in the house besides the meat and fish. 
So much uncertainty it is useless to pre- 
pare extra dishes or even ice cream, but 
it is well enough to make a little larger 
quantity of such plain things as we must 
have. 

Dinner. 



Tomato and green pease soup (4 qts. 
28 cents.) 

Fillet (leg) of veal stuffed {4 pounds

lowing full price for the soured milk, 27 
cents.) 

Second cooking : 

Fish, fried (12 pieces, 2% lbs gross, 25 ; 
lard, 5 ; 30 cents.) 

Mutton chops (2 pounds, 24 cents.)

, cents a pi ate. 

In this case it turned out as was half 
expected lor at just about the time that 
the regular dinner was ended there came 
two little parties of five and six persons 
respectively, making eleven more to fur- 
nish dinner to. Such little parties com- 
ing on the heels of a meal are generally 
profitable to the hotel keeper. On this 
occasion there was enough soup, coffee, 
potatoes, pudding and pie remaining and 
the fish and mutton chops specially 
cooked made up a good and plentiful 
dinner at an additional expense of less 



(No. 171) the fillet of veal being the same 
as the round of beef and solid meat. 
The dressing is pressed into the cavity 
left by removing the bone, and inclosed 
also by the skirt of fat, which should 
be left on the meat drawn close and tied 
around with twine. The surplus stuffing 
may be baked in a small pan and served 
with the meat and gravy. For best 
stuffing see No. 62. Half the quantity 
will serve for veal, and an egg added 
will make it richer. Drippings, lard or 
butter can be used instead of suet.

In calculating quantities to be pre- 
pared it is never necessary to count one 
portion of every dish to each person. 
Perhaps some who take fish will decline 
meat, or will take com and not potatoes, 
and only half the number will call for 
pie. 

536— Tomato and Green Pea Soup. 



One of the best looking soups when 
the pease are green and the soup is rich 
colored. This day it was the soup of 
necessity rather than choice for in truth 
we had a half can of tomatoes (8 cents) 
and nothing else for soup unless the late 
and neglected garden would yield some 
trifles. Found a few green pease, not 
enough to use as a vegetable, but about 
two cupfuls (10 cents) are plenty in soup, 
also some carrots and onions as thick as 
straws. Where there are no herbs, or 
cloves, or parsely a very small quantity 
of the feathery green carrot leaves may 
be used with advantage, minced and 
dropped in the soup just before serving. 
Made tomato soup as directed at No. 
166, and let the green pease cook in it 
about one-halt hour. Made four quarts 
and used one-half can tomatoes. Little 
burnt sugar to improve the color. 

537— Stuffed Fillet of Veal. 



The same in the main as the brisket 



cakes and still there remained 4 quarts 
more, and part of it was cream. It 
would make good cream cheese or smear- 
kase if it could be spared, but there be- 
ing none of the usual pudding ingre- 
dients in the house this comes in oppor- 
tunely for a good pudding. Curd from 
the cheese vats, that has been curdled 
with rennet and is not sour, is the chief 
ingredient in the genuine cheesecakes of 
old Maryland cookery; mixtures made 
too rich for everyday dinners. This is of 
the same kind and can be baked without 
a crust of pastry ; it is a pudding and not 
a tart or pie. 

I pound or little more of scalded curd. 

J^ teaspoon soda. 

% cup sugar. 

^ cup butter. 

I cup fine or minced bread crumbs. 

I cup milk. 

Nutmeg or other flavoring. 

3 eggs. 

it does not make much difierence how 
the ingredients are put together, but it is 
best to first take the dry articles and 
pound thena smooth and then add the 
eggs and milk. 

To obtain the curd set the pan con- 
taining a gallon of curdled milk on the 
stove when it is not very hot and let 
come to boiling heat, then pour it into a 
fine strainer or in a napkin to drain. 

There will be nearly a two-quart pan 
of pudding from the above ingredients.. 
Bake light brown and serve with a sauce.

"Alter the Fourth," says the reburt 
proprietor, "we must begin and get 
ready for the rush." 

"Will there be a rush?'* 

"Oh, the people have to come some- 
time— they always do." 

"There has nobody come yet — seems 
to be getting late." 

"No, this isn't late, it is early. I never 
looked for anybody to come until after 
the Fourth." 

"No?" 

"They cannot; the schools don't close 
till now, the weather is cool at their 
homes all through June; the Govern- 
ment employes do not take their vaca- 
tion till now and so many people will 
not leave their homes for lear they may 
be burned up on the Fourth, or be en- 
tered by roughs." 

"And yet Black's Hotel over here, 
has had, so they say, ninety boarders for 
a week or two past." 

"Oh, well, the people he gets would 
not come here, anyway, and they that 
will come here would not go there. He 
lets them fiddle and dance all night if 
they wish to, and drink beer, and row 
boats and sail and fish on Sundays." 

"They would not stay here a minute" 

"I suppose not." 

"Ana biiii they pay Black about nine 
hundred dollars a week 

"Well, I don't expect this thing to 
make any money, but if it pays its own 
expenses and keeps me and my family 
piv:uisantly I shall be satisfied." 



"I*m afraid your profits will never 
compare with Black's profits," 

"Well, well; we will be virtuous and 
we shall be happy." 

529— Shall We "hav7 a Bill-of-Fare? 



The answer that was reached when 
this question was discussed at this place 
was, that a bill-of-fare is a luxury that 
shonld be indulged in if possible and 
that in this case it could be adopted for 
dinner and was necessary, but was not 
needed for breaskfast or supper to an ex- 
tent commensurate with the trouble of 
preparmg it 

At the Pansyblossom House where I 
put in one summer they had never be- 
fore run a bill-of-fare but were quite de- 
lighted with the apparent ease, the neat- 
ness and economy of the bUl-of-fare 
plan. I heard somebody saying, when 
the busy season was over, that the pro- 
prietor intended to run a bill all through 
the rest of the year after that "for then 
instead of settmg out a lot of dishes to 
each person he would only have to g?ve 
them what they called for. The sequel 
to that stor}' I never knew, but feel sure 
the bili-of-fare was not kept up. It is 
harder for the cook and requires knowl- 
edge of tne names of dishes that poor 
Mary Jane does not possess. Here at 
Uintah Lake it was allowed that it would 
be the stylish thing to have one. 

"But 1 don't see how we can" says the 
landlady. 

"Didn't you have a bill-of-fare last 
year?" 

"Why, no, of course not. The girls 
just called off what we had." 

"Were they sweet-voiced German 
girls, like these who cannot warble out 
the names of our dishes with any more 
distinctness than an opera singer might 
give the words? And if so I don't see 
now you ever let your guests know what 
you had for them to choose from. The 
Dills cannot be printed daily in this coun- 
try place. We can get blanks printed 
however, and write the dishes in the 
proper places." 

"When I was clerk at the Rushbottom 
House at Limbertown," says the mana- 
ger, "we used to have seven different 
Biils-of-fare all printed at once, one lor 
each day of the week so when Monday 
came around we brought on the Mon- 



SAN JPRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



22 



day bill and so on through the week — 
why would not that do here?" 

"Would not do at all because of the 
location for one thing, for it will pften 
happen that not a single dish^ that is on 
your bill-of-fare can be obtained when 
wanted ; but it would not do for other 
reasons, because such a way defeats the 
object of having a bill and makes the 
hotel like an almshouse or House of 
Correction where they have a certam 
fare for each day; their boiled beef day, 
their suet puddinsj day, their pork and 
beans day and so on perpetually." 

Then the housekeeper spoke up ; 

"At the Water Cure Home at Camp- 
meetingville in the Great Frying Pan 
Valley we used to get along very well 
with having the waiters call off what we 
had, but then we never had but two 
kinds; still, that seemed to be enough." 

"Ah, yes," chimed in the proprietor 
facetiously, "but this will not be a water 
cure so much as a sort of hunger cure, 
and we must have variety. If we don't 
feed the people well they may be going 
ovtr to tne Trulirural House where they 
can board cheaper." 

"It is impossible," the cook said, "to 
set a superior table and distance rival 
houses or to get the full credit of your 
more liberal providing without a bili-of- 
fare. Suppose we have but two kinds of 
meat, there will be and ought to be 
about six kinds of vegetables, which are 
cheap and attractive if properly cooked | 
and which make up a good meal, and it 
would be tedious to call off so many 
while very few at table would really have 
opportunity enough to choose what they 
wished as they do from a piinted list. 
There is just one other way; that is, to 
call the meats only, and set out the 
full array of everything else that is 
ready in small dishes. Plenty of people 
like that way best, for they get plenty set 
before them and eat whatever strikes 
their fancy. The great objection to it is 
the great waste entailed. I'he perfection 
of all plans is to have a new bill-of-fare 
printed for each meal that comes, break- 
fast, lunch, dinner, supper, always new. 
That method leads to the smallest pro- 
portion of waste and greatest freshness 
of cooked dishes. The expense of so 
much printing and the fact of there be- 
ing so litde to change in the breakfast 



and supper menu leads nearly all hotel 
keepers to get the bills for these meals 
printed once for all, the same bill for 
weeks or months, while they change the 
dinner bill every day. Rather than do 
this I would 'call off the breakfast and 
supper and have but few dishes; for 
dinner, as said before, a written or 
printed bill-of-fare is indispensable."

In order to point out the the detriment 
these unchangeable breakfast cards are 
to the quality of the dishes served, here is 
a copy of one that was in use at a good 
two-dollar-a-day hotel. There are so 
many articles offered to the person at 
table, there are too many, but no more 
than rival houses offer and no more than 
is expected. It was a rule of that land- 
lord that nothing must be crossed off his 
bills. 

"Our list is so small," he would say, 
"that we cannot afford to drop even one 
dish from it." Consequently, although 
the meats might be cooked only as 
wanted there were many other articles 
that were necessarily prepared before- 
hand and by the usual contrariness of 
the luck when the corned beef hash, 
the com bread, codfish balls, or what-, 
ever else was fresh made, as good, as

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



bright colored, as rich, as well flavored 
as It could be there would not be one 
order for it; but, when it had been put 
away, brought out again and wanned 
over, lost its furst good quality and looked 
common and stale, then by the same 
blessed luck, everybody in the dining- 
room would be seized with a desire to 
have some. Did we try another way and 
make only five codfish balls instead of 
twenty— determined not to have any left 
over— that very morning at least twenty- 
five people would call for codfish balls 
at once. 

But here at Uintah Lake we will not 
have any breakfast or supper bill and 
you shall see how we will make the cod- 
fish balls go, each one to its proper 
plate. 

Mr. Farewell's consultation, as it 
seemed to be, with the manager and the 
house-keeper wai only a pretense for the 
purpose of reconciling them to the daily 
task in store for one or other of them of 
writing in the blank menu for dinner, for 
he had long ago decided that point for 
himself and taken pride in selecting a 
handsome heading of fine type with 
flourishes, which announced that this 
was the dinner, on such a date, at The 
Eyrie, Uintah Lake, State of Cornuco- 
pia, John Smith Farewell, proprietor: 



Dinner. 



ROAST. 



BOILED. 



SOUP. 



FISH. 



ENTREES. 



VEGETABLES. 



PASTRY AND DESERT. 



Assorted Nuts. Raisins. Tea. Coffee. 



That is a copy of our blank bill-of- 
fare, as simple as could be made, having 
the headings, and blank spaces for 
writing in. It seems, at first glance, 
that a number of stand-by dishes such as 
roast beef and mashed potatoes might as 
well be printed in and save so much 
writing; curiously enough, however, ex- 
perience shows that your boarders look 
only at the writing and you seldom get 
a call for anything that is in print. Let 
there be stewed tomatoes printed in 
place under the vegetable heading and 
one can will last a week, but write stewed 
tomatoes and you need two cans in one 
day. It should be all written or aU 
pnnted. 



Breakfast. 

July 5- 
No oatmeal in house. 
Veal steaks {2 lbs, 26 cents.) 
Mutton steaks or rough chops (2 lbs, 

22 cents.)

IS- 

$1 69; 21 persons, 8 cents a plate. 

540— Broiled Mutton Chops. 



Lay the chops on a plate and touch 
both sides with the butter brush. Broil 
over clear coals about five minutes, turn- 
ing over only once. 

Put a tablespoonful of butter into a 
tin pan, together with as much water 
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Shake 
together and when the chops are done 
let ihem lie in the pan and form their 
own gravy. 

541—Stewed Eggs. 



These are eggs poached, a large num- 
ber at once, then partly chopped.

seasoned and dished up by spoonfuls. 

Drop into a saucepan of water that is 
boiling gently (See No. 93) about a dozen 
eggs and cook medium or until the yolks 
begin to harden, then either drain away 
the water or dip the eggs into another 
vessel. Throw m a few small lumps ot 
butter, salt, and if you have white pep- 
per a little of that. Cut each egg in four 
with the edge of a spoon. 

542— Potatoes Minced and Browned. 



edge, and you have a long roll of dough. 
Place it in the tin and brush over with 
the brush dipped in a teaspoonful of 
melted lard and set on a warm shelf to 
rise. The use of beinp particular how 
you fold up the dough is that if done 
right the loaves rise even and smooth 
without a break, but if wrong they rise 
and split open at one end. This is a 
daint)^ sort of bread that makes baker's 
bread ashamed. 

Dinner. 



At No. 82 find potatoes minced and 
browned in entire dishes for restaurant 
orders. At No. 534 find potatoes minced, 
in cream. Another way is to put the 
minced cold potatoes in a baking pan, 
mix in a little mUk, butter, pepper and 
salt and brown the surface in the oven. 
Serve spoonfuls in flat dishes. 



543— To Warm Over Rolls. 



Take rolls left over from the previous 
meal, place in a pan and cover with a 
wet cloth, half a cotton flour sack or 
piece of old table cloth dipped in water 
will do. Set in the oven and by the 
time the cloth is dry the rolls will be as 
good as if fresh baiced — for such as are 
not critical judges of fresh bread. 

Some nights when the bands are play- 
ing and rockets flying it is exceedmgly 
inconvenient to stay at home and mix I 
dough, and a pan of rolls left over on \ 
purpose may do to satisfy the inexorable 
breakfast bill-of-lare at such a time. 



544— Fine Bread. 



Lake trout, baked, gravy, (2 lbs, 20 
cents.) 

Veal pot pie (meat, 24, crust, 4—28 
cents.) 

Potatoes mashed, browned (5 cents.) 

No other vegetables in house. 

No butter in house. 

Cherry pies (2 with 1 can cherries, 14; 
crust, 4; sugar, 2 — 20 cents.) 

Cottage pudding, hot cream sauce (2 
lbs, 20 cents.) 

Milk, cream, coffee, tea (26 cents.) 

$1 19; 20 persons, 6 cents a plate. 

That meal used up last of first lot of 
meat except sweetbreads reserved. 

Bought jar fresh butter at neighboring 
creamery at 20 cents a pound. Bought 
canned goods at country store. 

545— Veal Pot P.e. 



If such good bread can be afforded the 
receipt for French rolls (No. 532) may be 
used. That quantity makes two loaves. 
After it has been kneaded on the table 
the last time, as if for rolls, divide it in 
two and work up into round shape, then 
let them remain a few minutes while you 
grease two long and deep bread tins. 
Take your loaves, the rough under side 
up, and press a long depression down 
the middle with the knuckles. Then 
fold over one edge into the depression 
and press that down; then the other 



Put into a saucepan the pieces of veal 
that will not slice into neat cutlets, rinse 
off with cold water, then fill up and boil 
about half an hour. Take up the meat 
and cut it all into neat pieces as near one 
size and shape as can be, put in another 
saucepan or other pan and pour the 
liquor it was boiled in to it through a fine 
strainer. Put in a slice of salt pork, an 
onion, half blade of mace or half tea- 
spoon of powdered sage whichever may 
be at hand, for all are good seasonings 
for veal ; boil half an hour longer, add 
salt and pepper and thicken with flour 
mixed with water. Then drop spoon- 
fuls of dough on the surface, set in the 
oven and let cook about twenty minutes. 
Milk may be added to the liquor some- 
times for a change, making a white stew 
and then there should be a little greea 
parsley in it.

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



The use of taking out the meat and 
cutting when half cooked is for the bet- 
ter appearance on the dishes, as the 
pieces keep their shape and may be 
placed two in a dish with a light dum- 
Ung on top. 

.46— Pot Pie Dumplings. 



To make them, whether dropped far 
apart as aumplings or close together as 
one covering of crust, so that they will 
remain lir^ht after cooking and not go 
down like lumps ot lead, it is necessary 
to mix the dough so boft that it must be 
taken up and dropped with a spoon. All 
that is needed is : 

2 cups flour. 

I heaping teaspoon baking powder. 

Salt. 

I cup water. 

But sour milk and soda can be used 
and save powder. And to make a rich 
yellow sort an egg, or two yolks may be 
added. Mix the powder in the Hour, 
pour in the water and stir hard for one 
minute then drop into the boilng stew. 



547— CottagD Pudding. 



This, as well as the molasses pound 
cake is a great acquisition to the list of 
cheap cakes, for a good sort of cake it is, 
although served as a pudding. S9me of 
the large city bakeries are selling it now 
in different forms (See No. 285.) It is 
good likewise as a sally -lunn for 
breakfast, being not too sweet or rich, 
but short, light and wholesome: 

1 cup sugar — ^ pound. 
^ cup butter— Ji poimd. 
6 eggs. 

2 cups milk — a pmt. 

3 large teaspoons powder. 
6 cups flour — I V2 pounds. 

Make up like pound cake by cream- 
ing the butter and sugar together, add 
the eggs two at a time and beat in well, 
then the milk. Mix the powder in the 
flour and stir in. 1 '.eat the mixture well 
with the spoon. 

This makes two cakes in the common 
shallow tin baking pans about ten inches 
long. Let the batter be less than an 
inch in depth to bake easily, and sift 



some granulated sugar on the surface be- 
fore putting in the oven and the cakes 
will come out nicely elazed. One will 
serve to slice for puading with sauce, 
the other for cake. About 35^ pounds 
costs 28 to 30 cents. 



548— Cream Sauce for Puddings. 



Boil rich milk or cream with stick cm- 
namon or broken nutmeg in it and sugar 
to sweeten. Stir in a spoonful of starch 
mixed with cold milk. 



Supper. 



No meat in the house, b'lt some fish 
left yet. Good country lake house sup- 
per. "^ 

Fried trout (18 pieces, 4^ lbs gross, 
@ 8, 36; 2 eggs, and commeal 4; lard, 
^ lb, 7—47 cents.) 

Potatoes plain boiled (3 cents.) 
, French rolls (24, 10 cents.) 

Cherries {2 cans, 28 cents.) 

Cake (No. 547 — 13 cents.) 

Butter 10, milk and cream 20, coffee, 
tea, sugar 9 (39 cents.) 

$1 40; 20 persons, 7 cents a plate 

549-ls Fish Cheaper Than Meat? 



A few meals back some pickerel, home 
caught, is credited in our account, to 
the boys, as worth ten cents a pound, 
that is net weight. That Is what the 
fish we get by express seems to cost as it 
is put in the pan. It is bought at VVhite- 
fish Bay at seven cents, packed in ice 
and boxed; but it has to be expressed 
over two railroads in some way that 
makes it pay double rate, and twenty- 
five pounds costs 50 cents, and there is 
another carriage from the depot. Al- 
though they come clean as to the insides, 
the heads, fins and backbones take away 
one-sixth of the weight, on an average, 
of different kinds of fish. Therefore, 25 
lbs @ 7 cents and 50 cents added costs, 
$2 25. Take off one-sixth in trimming 
before cooking and we have scarce 21 
lbs of fish for that sum, it being nearer 
eleven cents per poimd than ten. As 
there is waste, likewise, in all other kinds 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTES 



26 



of meat, the only fair comparison that 
can be made is with the solid, boneless 
round of beef (No. 516) which we buy at 
thirteen cents. There is then a ditter- 
ence of three cents in favor of the fish, 
but if we cook it by breading and frying, 
the cost of fish and meat is about the 
same and our fish supper with fruit and 
cake is not one of the cheapest meals. 
The conditions are, of course, only local 
but are stated at length because they are 
likely to be much the same at a great 
number of resort houses. 



550— Fried Lake Trout. 



None of these tea-kettle cooks, either 
in this house or around at the neighbors', 
I find, have ever seen frying by immer- 
sion in hot fat before. Mrs. Tingee, 
too, I remember, although she had kept 
house fifteen years and a boarding 
house ten, had never known that pota- 
toes could be cooked by dropping them 
raw into hot fat— as French fried, and 
Saratoga chips— neither did the two 
ladies who boarded with her, the retail 
merchant's wife and the photographer's 
wife, they all thought that in every case 
potatoes must be boiled first. After 
thinking it well over I concluded not to 
mention frying fish that way to her, be- 
ing afraid to go into her kitchen and 
take her whole pound of lard at once, if 
I could ever find so much there, and j 

Eroceed to make^ it hibsing hot over the 
re, because it is dangerous to have a 
kettle of hot lard on the fire and a lady 
fainting around, both at one time. We 
grow reckless of lard where we cook tor a 
number of people every day, who pay a 
fair price for board and have something 
good to eat, and generally, besides, have 
a jar full of roast meat fat and melted 
suet that helps out without depending 
upon it except for a tew things that must 
be fried of a good clean color. It does 
not really consume much lard or fat to 
fry in it, as the same can be used several 
times over if care is taken not to let it 
burn black, still, in counting the cost it 
has to be remembered that the pound of 
lard put in the frj'ing pan becomes worse 
and darker with every frying and at last 
has to be thrown away. 
Cut the fish in pieces across without 



splitting it, if the full flavor of the 
fisti is desired rather than the fried crust. 

Beat one or two eggs with half their 
bulk of water. Pepper and salt the 
pieces of fish well, dip them in tne egg 
and then in com meal, coat well by 
pressing, then drop into lard that is hiss- 
ing hot and fry brown, allowing 8 or 10 
mmutes for the fish to get done to the 
bone. Dredge a little fine salt and keep 
hot in a pan in the open oven until 
served 

To fry without using eg^s, mix i cup 
of flour and 2 cups powdered crackers 
together. Dij) the pieces of fish in milk, 
then in the mixture, coat well, dipping 
twice if necessary, and fry brown. (See 
Nos. 13, 98 and 314.) 



551 Potatoes Plain Boiled. 



To go with hot fried fish there is no 
form of potatoes better than plain boiled. 
Pare them first and put on in salted 
water. When done drain off the water 
and serve the potatoes out of the sauce- 
pan as wanted. 



"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue 
ocean, Roll!" 

Cold day for resort keepers. Fierce 
north-west gale been blowing all day. 
This green little two-mile lake has been 
trying to lash itself into a rage and 
swamped all the skiffs.

552- Cutting Up a Ham. 



One of the most serious calamities that 
ever betalls Mary Jane is the sending 
her a whole ham to cut up, all by her- 
self: it is a calamity to the ham, too, 
when she has whittled it and hacked and 
torn k with her little case-knife that she 
tries to sharpen on the edge of the stove. 
Her reliance and the reliance of most 
private families is upon the butcher gen- 
erally:, to slice the ham before sending it, 
but in that case good ham is never as 
eood as it might be because it is cut too 
thick and being sawed through the bone 
from one end to the other many of the 
slices are of such a sort that a little of it 
goes a lon§ way. We have in our kitchen 
a meat block, a meat saw and a small 
cleaver, besides good knives. These 
things are indispensable both ioz econ- 
omy and good quality of the dishes we 
cook. Without them our choice ham 
that costs iq cents -a pound gross, and 
when the bone and rind is counted 
out, costs somewhere between 20 and 25 
cents, might all have to be whittled away 
in shreds and shavings without a respect- 
able slice among them. The best and 
most saving method of dealing with a 
ham is as follows : 




^ 



First, saw off the butt end of the ham 
as shown above, taking the projecting 
point of bone that is easily found for a 
guide where to cut. The lower wood- 
cut shows the inside of the butt where it 
has been cut and the black lines show 
where the knife must go to separate the 
meat on both ^ sides from the irregular 
shaped bone. There are then two 
pieces of ham, all meat, ready to be cut 
m slices, the thinner the better, with 
a sharp knife. Then cut down the large 
or mam portion as the line shows, from 
the shank to the bottom. There is a 
bone that guides the knife down that 
mark. All the piece on the right is 
solid meat ; the best part of the ham, and 
makes the handsomest slices. The 
other side can be sliced part way or be 
used for boiled ham. 

'553^Broiled Ham! 

Strange it seems, but it will hot do to 
make a regular practice of broiling ham 
over the stove hearth because it ruins 
the stove for drawing. After broiling a 
lot of ham where the smoke bova tne 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

broiling goes into the draught, the fire 
will go almost out and something gen- 
erated by the salt in the stove pipe pre* 
vents the fire being good again for a 
whole day. A few shoes for a family 
may be broiled without the bad effect 
being noticeable but when the house is 
full of people it may save trouble to re- 
sort to frying. 

It was thought here that charcoal 
would have to be provided, but the wood 
embers drawn out into the ash pan prove 
to be sufficient to broil over, thus far. 

Slice the ham thin and broil — if you 
can broil it — over clear coals about five 
minutes, turning it to get a good even 
brown on both sides. 



554— Poached Eggs on Toast. 



A neat little way of poaching eggs for 
a few people is to take tin muffin rings, 
the kind without bottoms, put them in a 
frying pan of salted boiling water and 
break an egg into each one and let it 
cook. Take up ring and all with a cake 
turner or shallow perforated ladle and 
take off the muffin rin^ after the erjg has 
been placed safely on its piece of 
buttered toast. We call this good for a 
few people, because when there are 
many it takes too long. (See No. 96.) 

555 — Fam y Toast for Poached Eggs. 

Cut for each dish three slices of bread 
very thin and quite square in form. 
Toast them, butter them, place one 
square in the middle of the dish. Cut 
the other two squares across comer- 
wise and you have four triangular pieces 
to place around that in the dish, the 
points oucwards. 



and if done before time to dish up can 
be kept hot in a pie-pan without spoiling. 

557- Trouble With the Coffee. 



556— Broiled Potatoes. 



They can be done in two ways, either 
cold boiled potatoes may be sliced, 
buttered v.'ith a brush, placed in the 
hinged wire broiler and broiled or toasted 
over the fire, or raw potatoes may be 
done the same way. The boiled pota- 
toes are quickest done and are much 
lUted. Should be sprinkled with finely 
minced parsley and with salt and pepper 



We are having bad coffee, it is poor in 
taste, worse in appearance; has that 
dirty color as if mixed with ink and none 
of the reddish-brown hue 9f good coffee. 
People here don't care much, as milk 
is the principal beverage except for two 
or three. That makes no difference, 
however, for the coffee must be not only 
good but superlatively so. Proprietor 
good naturedly says it is the fault of that 
common twenty-cent coffee, that is the 
only grade the country store can furnish, 
and we must wait until the good coffee 
I comes with all the other groceries. But 
it is not that. If they bring coffee that 
costs fifty cents a pound it will be as bad 
when made as this is, unless there be some 
other method of maidng adopted. I 
have blamed the coffee pots and tried 
and discarded three because they have 
lost their bright tinned inside and allow 
the iron to act upon the coffee and have 
taken to a bright tin pail, with some im- 
provement but great unhandmess. There 
IS one remedy for bad coffee but it is a last 
resort. In hotel work we go a long way 
around to avoid using eggs to clear cof- 
fee with. It is a constant tax to have 
to use half a dozen eggs every time cof- 
fee IS made when eggs may be both dear 
and hard to get, and we make fine coffee 
without, by dripping through a sack into 
an urn that has an earthen jar or porce- 
lain lining inside instead of metal. But 
here the common family coffee pot is the 
only utensil to use unless we send to 
Lakeport for an urn. 

Tried the egg remedy and it proved 
satisfactory. Put the grourid coffee in b 
small deep pan with a cup of cold water, 
broke in one egg and mixed well by 
stirrmg, put it into the pot of boiling 
water and when it boiled up again set S 
off the fire and poured in a little cold 
water to make it settle. The coffee is 
fine now, although of a low-priced sort 
but only as long as it remains in that 
ccfiee pot. Poured off soxe into another 
coftee pot to be clear of grounds and in 
fifteen minutes it had turned to the same

muddy, inky fluid we had before, while 
that in the pot it was made in remained 
good and bright the whole day. 

The worriment about poor cofifee is 
almost universal. The egg-clearing way 
is well-known, but there is, even after 
that, some attention to be paid to 

• the vessel it is kept in. It may be that 
the good effect ol the egg was greatest in 

. coat tng over the inside of the cofifee pot 
it was cooked in. At this place eggs are 
cheap and we shall use whatever may be 
necessary to keep the cofifee bright and 
clear, and not buy an urn. 



The 'bus has broug^ht a passenger. 
Put him on the new register, quick! A 
majestic looking gentleman, and they 
say he is all the way from Rome. 
Later. 

The passenger only came to try to con- 
tract to deliver us a carload of water- 
melons every week. The extent of our 
business will not warrant such a contract 
at present. I would rather have fifteen 
cents' worth of onions, ten of turnips 
and ten of carrots and parsley for my 
soups. He thinks we might club to- 

§ ether with the other houses. After 
inner he will go and see them and then 
he starts back to his home in Rome

558— Cocking Sweetbreads. 



It is the making of sweetbreads to 
press them to a flat shape between two 
pans after boiling them, and let them get 
cold that way. As a rule they are 
always boiled before being otherwise 
cooked ; not but what they may be cut 
up and stewed, or split qpen and broiled 
without brevious cooking if they are 
calves' sweetbreads, and tender, still it is 
best to do the other wa^ and the largest 
and finest that people will naturally select 
for the best are the very ones that need 
about an hour's boiling to make them 
tender. 

Sweetbreads are the whitish pieces of 
soft meat that look like fat, found near 
the throat and the heart of the animal 
the largest coming from the heart. They 
are used extensively as a fancy meat for 
little side dishes. 

When they first come from the 



butcher's put them in cold water and 
after steepmg a while set them over the 
fire in a saucepan of water to cook for an 
hour. As they have an insipid taste that 
is not improved by keeping, a little vine- 
gar should be put in the water they are 
boiled in — about four tablespoons — and 
some salt. Take them up in a pan or 
dish, put another on top of them and a 
heavy weight like a i-ail of water on that. 
When cold you can split them into thin 
slices and tnm off the rough edges.

SAN JFRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



SO 



560— To Cook Green Pease. 



Hard water is the best to boil them in 
as it preserves the green color. If they 
take more than half an hour to cook it 
shows that they are not worth the name 
of green pease. Very few people gather 
pease young enough to be at their prime 
or seem to know how great the difference 
can be. We get pease from the garden, 
as good and better than the finest 
French canned pease, by taking them 
early. 

Have the water boiling when you put 
the pease in, and a little salt in it and 
boil gently tUl done. If old pease, put 
a pinch of soda in the water and keep 
stewing an hour or mpre. Drain off the 
water and season either with butter, or 
cream sauce. (See No. 50.) 

Who's going to scrub the kitchen? 
Not I, of course. It is gettmg pretty 
dirty by this time, the stove, too. House- 
keeper comes along casually as it were, 
anci looks, and looks. She does not say 
anything; she will never say anything, 
but some people can look a whole vol- 
ume. I suppose she had everything 
dreadful nice and clean at the Water 
Cure Home at Campmeetingville in the 
Great Frying Pan Valley. 

When I first came here I was allowed 
my choice of four of the hired girls to 
take one to be my second cook. Was 
fool enough to choose the prettiest and 
smartest. . Guess she will think herself 
too nice to scrub. Don't like to ask her. 
Wish I could swap her off for my old 
Mike or Slim Tim, or Reddy; they were 
the boys could sling a scrub broom and 
were not afraid of a kettle of boiling lye 
—except when they had new boots on, 
which was about once a month, poor 
bojrs, for hot lye is awful hard on boots

dtewers, ther. send it in. 

As only about half the people will take 
liver when there is other meat, and as 
each slice weighs but an ounce, three 
quarter pound of liver and half pound 
bacon serves for 20 persons* orders, 
Brochette is French for spit or skewer. 



563— Lyon&ise Potatoes. 



Lyonaise potatoes are cold boiled 
potatoes sliced in a frying-pan, and 
Drowned with a little minced onion 
mixed with the drippings. But, on ac- 
count of the very general objection to 
onions, at least among business people, 
the name of lyonaise is often given to the 

Elain article, that is, to cold potatoes 
ied more or less brown, in a little fat in 
a frying-pan without the onions. 

In this case, having no parsley I used 
green onions from the seed bed very 
spannglv, as much for the green sprink- 
Img as for taste; partly fried the onions 
in the drippings before putting the po- 
tatoes in. Potatoes this way should be 
^ced small. 

But who is going to scrub the kitchen? 
My gracious 1 And the housekeeper, 
from the Water Cure Home has been in 
since breakfa^jt looking harder than 
ever. And there is my "sec." A great 
singer she is, with not the least intention 
of having a scrub out, singing in chorus 
with three other German girls, and wip- 
ing i)ans, not at the hotel rate of a mile 
a minute, but at about the eighth of a 
mile an hour. It is a very pretty pic-nic, 
this summer resort business, at present 
and I hate to break it up.

564— Nudels, Noodles or Nouilles 

Paste. 



There was a rather fimny passage ol 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



comment and rejoinder not long since be- 
tween certain New York and Philadel- 
phia editors, occasioned by the former 
having seen "Nudels" somewhere for the 
first time and the latter remarking that 
his friend would see nudels or noodles 
very frequently indeed if he would visit 
the good land of Pennsylvania. It is 
just barely possible that neither of these 
had ever recognized * 'nudels" in the 
French nouilles soup of their several city 
hotels and restaurants. Undoubtedly 
German nudel is the proper word and the 
nudel is the original German home- 
made macaroni. 

To make nudels is an extremely sim- 
ple matter if you start right and there is 
no real need of the trouble being taken 
of drying the dough before or after 
shredding it. Drop the yolks of two 
eggs in a cup, add flour by the teaspoon- j 
fill and a little salt and stir together to ' 
make it a stiff yellow dough. Then turn 
it out on to the table and work more 
flour in as long as the yolks will take up 
any. Next, roll out the lump till it is as 
thin as a knife blade, dust it all over 
with flour, cut it into bands and lay one 
on tO{) of the other — the flour keeps 
them from sticking together — and then 
with a sharp knife cut off the nudels in 
shreds no thicker than straws and all of 
one length, which will be the width of 
the bands of dough. Shake the shreds 
apart and dust with flour and slide them 
into a dry pan to keep until the soup is 
ready to receive them. Any surplus 
flour may be got rid of by shaking the 
nudels around in a seive, and if to go in 
a very clear soup or consomme (139) they 
can be parboiled separately firet and 
dipped up with a skimmer. 



565— Nudel or Noodel Soup. 

It has no particular or special flavor- 
ings beyond the nudels or nouilles paste. 
Make as rich a broth as the meat and 
bones at your disposal will allow, by 
boiling them several hours, with a bunch 
of the ordinary soup vegetables and 
a stalk of celery. Strain the broth into 
a clean saucepan, skim off all the grease, 
add a spoonful or two of tomato juice or 
catsup, salt and white pepper and a little 
flour thickening, and if you wish to 



make it a prettier color and show up the 
nudels better put in a tablespoonful of 
burnt sugar coloring. Let it boil again 
and fifteen minutes before dinner time 
throw in the nudels and let cook until 
time to serve. 

At the Monegaw White and Black 
Sulphur Springs Hotel, I used to make 
nudel soup almost daily for a poor lady 
in the last stage of consumption who 
could eat a plateful of this farinaceous 
sustenance every day for weeks after she 
was past every other kmd of food. 



566 — Beans Baked in Jars, or Boston 
Baked, or Potted Beans. 



We see this dish with all these names 
and others besides in hotel biils-of-fare. 
Thb is something that we can never 
have at this little summer house, for the 
cooking arrangements are not right. 
There is a very wide-spread custom 
among hotel-keepers of having baked 
beans and brown bread served hot 
for Sunday breakfast. It is generally 
thought that a brick oveii is an indis- 
pensable requirement for the baking, yet 
at the Rathburn House at the Moun- 
tain Gap, we used to bake beans most 
perfectly in the range in which the night- 
watchman kept up a slow fire all night. 
On account of the expense of fuel we 
only baked once a week and then used 
two jars of a larger size, than is ordi- 
narily required, that there might be cold 
beans for several days after. For a gal- 
ion jar take : 

8 cups of navy beans (14 cents.) 

J^ cup molasses (2 cents.) 

I tablespoon salt. 

y^ pound salt pork (5 cents.) 

Supposing they are to be baked during 
Saturday night, put them in water to 
soak in the morning, and set the pan in 
a warm corner. At night drain away 
the water that remams, put the beans in 
the jar, also the molasses, salt and piece 
of pork and pour in fresh water enough 
to be about an inch above the beans. 
Put on the lid or a little plate and set the 
jar in the oven. It is a mistake to get up 
a great fire and keep the beans funously 
boiling as some do, that try it for the 
first time; they have not the taste oi 



S3 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



baked beans when done; but keep a 
slow and steady fire and let the jar tc- 
main in the oven 8 or lo hours. They 
should come out brown on top, yet not 
quite without water at bottom. 



567 — Canned Tomatoes as a Vege- 
table. 



Let the tomatoes stew down to dry out 
the surplus juice if possible, instead of 
adding bread crumbs to thicken them. 
Canned tomatoes are vastly improved (in 
the way of being solid packed) over what 
they were a few years ago, when they 
were generally colorless and watery. 
While they are stewing add salt and pep- 
per and a small piece of butter if affprd- 
ed. If bread crumbs are added mince 
them, very fine first, or better still, do as 
they do at Black's, for their 90 boarders; 
put the cold rolls in a pan of cold water 
and after a few minutes drain the water 
off and squeeze the bread dry. This 
soaked and squeezed bread is called 
panada. It is used for chicken stufl&ng 
as well as to thicken tomatoes. 

"When we're rich we ride in chaises, 
When we're poor we walk (or worK) 
like blazes r 
— Hudibras (or some other fellow.) 

The deuce take this disappointing sum- 
mer resort business. Here is a week gone 
and nobody has come yet. Proprietor 
evidently disappointed; feels like one 
forsaken ; has gone and got a saw and 
hatchet and '"^ tearing up and repairing 
the dilapidatea cellar steps with his near- 
ly new nfty-doUar summer resort suit on. 
That's a great way to save expenses. I 
feel sorry for his suit but not so sorry for 
him as I should be for a poor man who 
might have spent everything getting ready 
for a resort business that never comes 
after all. One week is nothing if one 
only knew what is to come. If one week 
goes by and brings nobody why may not 
the next and the next? There may be a 
host of summer tourists on the way v;ho 
will fill all the rooms and ask for cots and 
tents, and beds even on the roof of the 
house, for all we know, but suppose a 
rainy spell or a cold spell intervene and 
they never get here. And they say that 
at this time last year there were over forty 



people visiting here. When a man who 
has Deen keeping open house for years, 
at last provides himself with a real hotel 
register with $2.00 per day printed on 
the top of every page, it does seem as 
though by that act he had alienated 
every friend he had in the world. That's 
whai makes the proprietor tired. He is 
tired of playing the lone fisherman ; tired 
of sitting on the piazza seeing the 'bus 
come back and waiting my darling sum- 
naer boarder for thee ; tired of hearing his 
hired girls sing the beautiful river; tired 
of seeing his boat boy in the big sailor 
hat idly sitting on his lone rock by the 
sea; tired of thinking that somebody's 
coming when the dew drops fall; tired of 
resting and gone to work. 



56B— How^ to Scrub the^Xitchen. 



Swish, Bang ! 

, Why, it is a real relief to see the boiling 
hot suds and lye water dash around and 
deluge tables, walls, shelves, stove and 
floor once more, after all these years 
endurance of that vile, slimy, push-the- 
dirt-in-the-comers-and-leave-it-there way 
of mopping the horrible painted, grained 
and varnished kitchens of the present 
idiotic fashion. What! let the spiders 
build webs over the range and stay there 
the yeararoimd because the painted walls 
are too good to have hot suds thrown 
upon them? 

Now, I hope that housekeeper from the 
Great Frying Pan Valley will stay away 
while I scald something. This is my 
water cure, and my old Mike and Slim 
Jim and Reddy know it is a good one. 
1 want to scald the winter and spring 
mouldiness, the bugs and roaches, flies, 
muddaubers, daddy-longlegs, spiders, 
centipedes, mice,toads, snails and things, 
and there will be no reserved seats foi 
spectators for a while. One afternoon, 
not long since, I went to show an old 
second of mine who is pastry cook at the 
Bendebeer House at Bmgen-on-the- 
Bayou, how to make the Kaaterskill flan- 
nel rolls, sometimes called German puffs, 
that are just now the fashion, and while 
there had a chance to try the efficacy of 
boiling water. That house, too, has a 
painted and varnished kitchen with every- 
thing as inconveniently placed as all the 



SAN J^RANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

modem improvements could possibly be, 
and altogether too nice for cleanliness. 
There are patent doors with patent springs 
to shut them up quick to keep the fresh 
air out; patent windows with nickel- 
plated fastenings and blinds and screens 
and shutters to keep the foul air in. The 
meat block is at the other end of the 
table distant from the broiler; the pastry 
room is two rooms distant from the oven ; 
the kitchen floor is covered with oilcloth 
and a girl slimes itoverwitha mop at 
eleven every morning, and the cock- 
roach population of that fine house is 
over a hundred millions (estimated). 
Seeing an odd million or so of the abomi- 
nable insects roosting in a bunch under a 
low shelf near the range I could not 



and go back to their old haunts. 
It is all egregious folly making kitchens 
good to stand boiling water. At

some hotels that have been rebuilt two 
or three times and thereby cured of the 
first follies and made right at last. They 
have stone floors in the kitchens even 
when up stairs, and tile drains where the 
water may flow free. The old and nat- 
ural style of kitchen had massive oaken 
beams and rafters, solid oaken tables and 
walls or wainscot that could be scrubbed. 
Every time I chop the fins and head off 
a fish, or strike abroiling chicken with 
the side of the cleaver to flatten it for 
the gridiron a spray of animal juices flies 
and strikes somewhere. It may bescarce- 
, ly visible at one time yet it coats over 
resist the temptation to sling a two-quart the walls alter a whlie. On the river we 
dipper of hot boiling water. Brought ' call the dividing walls bulkheads and we 
them all down at one shot. But, as if that i used to scrub these bulkheads as 
was not enough, from some painted and thoroughly as the tables and floors and 
grained little cuddy hole underneath a lot we found that after scrubbing with 
of mice skipped out,for the hot water had brooms dipped in a tub of hot water con- 
lallen into a breeding place that had been taining some lye or soap, if the water we 
imdisturbed perhaps smce the house was rinsed off with was likewise boiling hot 
built. It being none of my funeral I left the boards dried much whiter than if 



the place before the cook came home 
Swash, Zip! 
There's that housekeeper from Camp- 
meetingville looking agam, and I guess 
she is laughing now. But, for pity's sake, 
what made her skip away so quick? There 
was no danger. Guess I can hit where I 
aim, if she can't, and did not aim her way. 
BoiUng water and plenty of it, is a good 
thing to fight a mutmous boat's crew with. 
It is an infallible exterminator. This 
method of hydraulic scrubbing is new to 
her. Wants a hose and tank of boiling 
water to do it up perfectly. She was look- 
ing to see where the water goes when it is 
brushed off the tables and stove and falls 
from the walls. Where does she think it 
goes? Where does she think the flies 
comes from that she spends half her life 
fighting to death ? They come out of the 
ground, under damp floors where there 
are crumbs and sweepings and decaying 
matter. That is where this scalding lye 
and soap water is going and it wilT kill 
more flies in their infancy than her suf- 
focating insect powder ever will. Insect 
powder does not kill. It is necessary to 
take up the vermin in their apparently 
dead state and bum them, otherwise, 
after a few hours they begin to kick, then 
get up and look around, snake themselves 



rinsed off with cold water. 

"Ohl how white your tables are dry- 
ing? 

"Yes, of course the/re white — did you 
think I was going to mop them?" 

"HouseKeeper says we can get a tub of 
boiling suds and do the pantry that 
way." 

"Ah, wretched hypocrites, you can get 
awfully enthusastic over it now the work 
is done. Get out." 



It is not so mnch of a pic-nic for the 
waiter girls when these summer houses 
fill up at last. The reason why the girls 
at that same Bendebeer House al Bineen- 
on-the-Bayou looked so pale and powd- 
ered and rouged so ridiculously was not 
because they were dissipated as some 
thought and said, but because the ne- 
cessity of keeping their pink gowns 
starched out as wiae, stiff and sharp al- 
most as mowing machines robbed them 
of hours of sleep. I should like to know 
if anybody thought they could pay for 
all tnat laundry work out of their wages 
—their linen cuffs and little frilled aprons 
and white neck gear, fresh ever dinner 
time. They rose at three in the moming 
taking turns by squads to have the use* 
of the laundry betore the regular laundry

COOKING FOR PROMT. 



hands came on ; in the interval between 
dinner and supper they had to po and do 
something else to the duds anc at night 
after the dining room doors were closed 
and the laundry hands had vacated the 
place they took'possessionof the starching 
and ironing tables for several hours at a 
spell. Misery loves company and they did 
not seem to know they were suffering as 
long as all the other girls had to go through 
the same ordeal. But it did make them 
pale and gaunt to a degree that the regu- 
lar day work alone would not have 
done. Then they piled on the artificial 
colors. 



569— Trouble witn Steam Chest and 
Vegetables. 



The caustic concentrated lye we buy 
in cans has to be used in moderation ; the 
steam from it alone caused a painful 
ulceration of the breathing apparatus of 
a lot of us fellows once where we threw it 
around too carelessly. The old-fashioned 
ash-hopper lye is doubtless as danger- 
ous if boiled down strong. It was at the 
Uncomphagre House, out in the Rath- 
skeller Range of mountains, Slim Jim 
Dalton was my second then. He was 
the most cleanly boy I ever knew. He 
had just quit the Quaintuple House at 
Turtle Key, because he could get noth- 
ing but sea water there to scrub with, 
and ii would not make a lather. I doubt 
whether he would have taken the key as 
a gift, or a whole bunch of keys in 
Grouper Inlet if they were without soft 
water to make soap suds with. But he 
could never be a good cook for he seemed 
to be devoid of the senses of taste and 
smell. A thing might be burmng up on 
top of the range for an hour before ever 
he would find it out, and then he was in- 
dolent. If he scrubbed the floor until it 
was as white as a table-cloth it seemed to 
be only that he might have the luxury of 
rolling down to sleep upon it without 
soiling his white shirt, and after draining 
the steam chest dry he often forgot or 
neglected to fill it again, and the result 
was that the pipes which take the water 
down into the tire-backs often went dry 
and burnt a good way up, and that makes 
one of the worst of smells and taints the 



vegetables that are steamed over the steam 
chest for days afterwards. Another thing, 
there was no ice, and the water the 
pared potatoes were kept in would hardly 
stay sweet over night. 

We have to keep potatoes and other 
vegetables after they have been pared 
ready for breakfast covered with wat^r, 
otherwise they turn black and wilt in a 
short time, but it is necassary if any are 
left over to put them in fresh water and 
let them be the next to be used. This 
Slim would not always do, and the pota- 
toes at the bottom of the keg acquired a 
bad smell. We had a lot of awful par- 
ticular people in that house, and one day 
after those bad potatoes had been steam- 
ed over that badly burned steam chest 
some of them made a grand kick and the 
proprietor who did not know what was 
the matter any more than a child, got 
clear off his head about the reputadon of 
his house. I promised there should be 
no more cause for complaint and Slim 
turned over a new leaf with his potatoes ; 
threw away the wooden keg and got two 
stone jars and kept them scalded out. 
But we did not know what to do with the 
steam chest. The foul smell was caused 
by the starchy sediment that drips from 
steaming vegetables going down into the 
pipes and burning there when the pipes 
get dry. I suppose the only way 
to clean them was to take them off, but 
that we could not do. Slim thought 
concentrated lye was good for ever3rthing 
and put a can m the steam chest and let 
it dissolve. The burnt stuff was not the 
right sort for lye to act upon, but it 
seemed to eat away by degrees, so we 
kept it up for days and weeks, drawing 
the lye water to scrub with and putting 
in fresh every morning and living in the 
steam from the boiling lye until it had 
nearly put the whole of us, seven in all 
who worked in the kitchen, past working 
at all, our lungs seemed all on fire and 
we had not the least idea of what was 
causing the sickness. The truth dawned 
upon us at last, and then I banished 
concentrated lye from the place entirely 
and drove a wooden plug into the faucet 
so that Slim could not drain the steam 
chest dry any more. The cause once 
unJerstood and removed, we soon re- 
covered from the ailment. But Slim was 
all broke up. The floors lost their white-

ness. He took to looking out of the 
windows and whistling 10 himself, and 
soon left me, to find some other place 
where the water was all soft and where 
they made in unlimited abundance their 
own soft soap. 



Five arrivals this evening. They have 
come for the season. They are either 
frdta Paris or Peoria, Pekin or Pewaukee

570— B. oiled Mackinaw Trout. 



If the fish is of small size, split it length- 
wise in halves and remove the bone 
entirely, by cutting along both sides of it. 
Dry the halves on a clean kitchen towel, 
dredge with pepper and salt, dip both 
sides in flour, place them in the hinged 
wire broiler and cook over clear coals. 
When partly cooked, brush over with 
melted butter and keep it moist until well 
done through. To serve, turn out of the 
broiler on to a little board on the table, 
kept for the purpose and divide each side 
in four by a sudden chop with a large 
sharp knife. For a plain family supper 
like this, no sauce is needed, but have tne 
fish freshly cooked and hot. May also 
be served like No. 58. 



Note. — It is not necessary to cock 
broiled fish entirely on the broiler, but, 
when the place is wanted to broil the 
beefsteaks the fish may be finished in a 
pan in the oven. Very large fishes are 
sometimes broiled whole ostensibly, when 
they are in reality baked except fcr suf* 
ficient broiling at first to give them the 
marks and appearance. A very nice^ 
broil can also be effected over the top ot 
the stove, by beginning a little earlier.

571— Boiled Trout. 



When we have but a smalt amount of 
iish Wvi boil it, because we find that "it 
goes further" that way than if baked or 
broiled; whether the reason be that it 
shrinks less or that there are fewer orders 
for it. Boiled fish ought not to be con- 
sidered inferior, for m no other way is 
the peculiar flavor of a fine fish so well 
preserved. It is always safe when the 
preferences of the people to be served are 
unknown, to boil a trout or salmon in 
water that is well salted and without other 
seasonings. At some other time you can 
try the addition of an onion stuck with 
four cloves, and half a cup of vinegar to 
the water, and perhaps a bayleaf and 
some parsley, besides the salt. Use a 
bright pan if yon add vinegar, or the fish 
will be dark. As our summer boarders 
all come to the table a t the same minute 
and want to be served instantly, we pre- 
pare the fish for dishing up by cutting it 
m portions half way through before boil- 
ing, being careful to sever the bone at 
each cut, which is easily done with the 
point of a large knife. Then the fish 
must not boil too long, nor too fast ; have 
the water boiling in a deep boiler, pan, 
or something roomy enough, drop in the 
fish and simmer not longer than half an 
hour. Drain off most of the water. Serve 
on small plates with the sauce at the side 
of the piece of fish. 

572— Taking Unw.rrantable Liberties 

Whoever serves fish or meat to a num- 
ber of guests at a public house of whose 
tastes and preferences he can know noth- 
ing, takes unwarrantable liberties with 
their food if he covers it with a sauce be- 
fore sending it in. The sauce should be 
placed under or at the side of the cut. 
The salmon or the trout- may be fine, 
firm, flaky, pink-fleshed, good to look at, 
and appetizing, but t.ie sauce may be a 
dull paste, perhaps tasting of butter of a 
poor quality ; or, if of the very best quality 



when first made it may have become thick 
and stringy with waitmg, or, it m^y be a 
caper sauce, which the person does not 
like, or eggs, or tomato, or anchovy which 
many detest — why should the fish or meat 
be deluged with these peculiar flavors 
whether the recipient wishes it or not ? 
There is an answer — it is because that it is 
the custom of French cooks and so the 
directions read. But it never was in- 
tended for general application. One day 
I happened to be at the Lookover-the- 
Mountain House (by-the-Sea) when a 
large number of prominent townspeople 
were taking dinner there for some com- 
plimentary purpose concerning the ex- 
cellence of the table, and the cook served 
the fish with wine sauce. The fish was 
of the finest ; probably it was well cooked ; 
: but whether it was the wrong wine or no 
! wine at aU, but a substitute, the sauce 
' was sweet ; it could hardly have been 
sweeter if it had been molasses ; it had 
the Parisienne potatoes in it saturated and 
dingy, and each portion of fish served 
was buried out of sight under a large 
six)onful of the mess. There are plenty 
of reasons why sauces may be bad in spite 
ot skill and good intentions, but they are 
of small consequence in the houses where 
they are but poured at the side and not 
over the cut of meat or fish, because then 
a free choice is left to either take or leave, 
and the cook's sauce is placed upon its 
own merits. 



573— Butter Sauce— Rest. 



2 cups clear strained broth or water. 

% pound butter or more. 

2 heaping tablespoons flour. 

Salt, if not enough in the butter. 

Take half the butter and all the flonj 
and stir them together in a saucepan over 
the fire. When well mingled and bub- 
bluig from the bottom add the boiling 
water or broth a littb at a time, stirring 
till all is in and the sauce has cooked 
thick and smooth. Take it from the fire 
and beat in the other half the butter a 
portion at a time and do not let it boil 
again. It looks glossy and smooth as soft 
butter ; may need thinning down for some 
purposes, as for parsley sauce, etc. 

The above makes over a pint of sauce ; 
the cost is whatever the price of the but- 
ter used may bt.

575— Family Roast Beef. 



Each of beef weighs on an average 
2 pounds "hen it has been shortened and 
tnmmed ready for roasting. Our 2-rib 
roast weighs 4 pounds and takes an hour 
to cook well done. Roasted meat is at 
its best when it is but just done, when 
the gravy flows freely, as soon as it is cut. 
I make it an invariable practice to hold 
back the roasting until the last ; a cut that 
will take 2 hours goes in just 2 hours be- 
fore dinner time, and if tnere is no gravy 
on hand and the pan is required to make 
some, change the meat into another pan 
15 minutes before dishing up — which gives 
time for the gravy making. 

Some comical wordy encounters take 
place at times through the difference of 
menus of quantity between hotel and 

Erivate house people. "Four pounds of 
eef for twenty-five people's dinner!" 
says one, "why, that would not be more 
than enough for my family at home." 
"Two pounds of meat to make an entree 
for a dinner for fifty \" exclaims another — 
"and even when it is chicken meat nicely 
fixed up, still only two pounds I Nonsense, 
you can't tell me, I know that one hungry 
man could eat up the whole business." 

At the same time Mrs. Tingee, who 
knows far more about saving than ever I 
can tell her would think we were giving 
ruinously large rations if she could see. 
It is a curious study, this bill of fare 
plan with its small amount of each of 
many viands, I have not time to at- 
tempt to explain how it is that the one 
hungry man does not eat up the whole 
business, nor a dozen hungry men either. 
These little bills of fare are truthful 
records of stubborn facts and they may 
explain it all. If not, we shall find out 
how well fed all these people have been 



576— Brown Pan Gravy or Espagnote. 



The brown sauce which in systematic 
cooking we find so useful, so indispensa- 
ble, even, is not much unlike the frying- 
pan gravy that Mary Jane makes very 
nicely, sometimes, by taking out the fried 
pork, sausage or chicken and pouring in 
water or milk and thickening it when it 
boils, but we are strictly careful to get rid 
of all the grease. We think over the matter 
an hour or two ahead of the time for 
making gravy to see what can be put in the 
pan to make it richer and to improve the 
color, and we make it in the roast meat 
pans, and generally in the oven.^ The 
material for making the gravy is the 
essence of beef or other meat that escapes 
from the meat in roasting, as already 
mentioned at Nos. 170, 185, 171, 144 and 
other places, and settles at the bottom of 
the pan, and of course the more meat the 
better the gravy \yiir be. It is well 
enough, but not strictly necessary to put 
a piece of turnip, carrot and celery in the 
pan along with any rough pieces of meat 
besides the roast, and there must be some 
salt put in at the beginning. All the time 
the meat is roasting there is more or less 
water in the pan andthe grease and gravy 
are mixed together, but when the meat is 
taken out the pan dries down, the essence 
sticks on the bottom and turns brown 
like the outside of roast meat and the hot 
grease above it is as clear as water and 
can be poured ofl'into ajar to be used for 
frying and other purposes. That being 
done put into the pan a quart, more or 
less 01 water or soup stock, let it boil up 
and dissolve the brown glaze, then add 
flour thickening a little at a time, making 
it as thick as cream, let boil and strain it 
into a saucepan. It is then ready for use ; 
but if allowed to simmer at the side of 
the range, it will throw up scum and 
grease which must be skimmed off, and 
the sauce becomes bright and is much 
improved. 

577— Baltimore Butter Pie or Custard 
Without Eggs. 

Having no eggs left after breakfast, 



S9 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



made a kind of pie that serves in place 
of pudding and needs none. 

At the Kissimmeequick Hotel— a noted 
resort on the-Kissimmee River— they have 
one of those little customs with which no 
fault can be found of keeping a standing 
favorite dish always on the Dill of fare, 
and there it is custard pie, regularly, 
there being another kind of pie and the 
pudding and cream to make the changes 
on. But there ihe supplies are by no 
means regular in arriving, and when they 
have no eggs they make custard this way : 

4 cups milk — a quart. 

I small cup butter— 6 ounces. 

i^ cups sugar — 12 ounces 

I level cup tiour — 4 ounces. 

Boil the milk with the bntter in it and 
a spoonful of the sugar to prevent burn- 
ing. Mix the Hour and sugar together 
dry, stir them into the boiling milk quickly 
with a wire egg beater, like making mush 
and take from the tire as soon as it begins 
to thicken. It will finish cooking in the 
pies. Line 2 deep custard pie plates with 
crust rolled very thin and pour the 
whcle 3 pints of mixture into them — if 
you have people enough to eat so much, 
if not. of course the receipt can be 
divided. The butter is the only flavoring 
needed in this mixture and must be good. 
Bake m a slack oven until the filling be- 
gins to rise in the middle. It will rise 
and flow over the edge if baked too long. 
Cost of mbcture here 17 cents and crusts 
of rich paste 10 cents for two. Cut each 
pie in eight — they are deep enough for 
that. Can be made richer yet with cream.

There is music on the water to-night — 
serenading party in boats — fifteen young 
ladies have come to the Trulirural House 
to board for a week or two — glee club or 
seminary class or something of the sort 
from Basswood City, and they are down 
at our boat landing singing. Proprietor 
of the Trulirural has instigated them to 
that — knows that our side cannot muster 
even a parlor quartette. If Mr. Farewell 
would put his hired girls in a boat and 
tell them to sing their loudest that party 
would soon be put to fleht. I suppose that 
would not do — it would make what they 
call a scandal, and, instead, the manager, 
the housekeeper and 'bus driver are hang- 
ing the trees lull of Chinese lanterns, and 
the boat boy with the big hat, is getting 
out some fire-works. 

"For it makes the heart so gay^ 
To hear the sweet birds singmg 

On their summer hol-i-day." 

It does put new life into a fellow who 
is weary of his ill success when duck 
hunting to see the game come circling 
around at last. 



579— Mrs. Tingee's Custard Pie. 



The glory of the custard pie, is in the 
depth or thickness of it. The distance 
should be great between the glossy surfece 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

wravering between orange, yelbw and 
brown and the substratum,wafer-like in its 
thinness, of paste. The custard pie, then 
demands a pie pan of an uncommon 
depth and spaciousness, with a capacity 
not frittered away in broad and spreading 
edges but, rather, with boundaries of an 
upright character and quite ur.9btnisive, 
the necessary wall of crust being of no 
great moment, so that it be respectably 
short as all about a custard pie that is 
worthy of consideration relates only to 
the iiliing. Taking this view of the cus- 
tard pie, which I believe is the popular 
one. I have been troubled about pie 
pans. We have none at this place but 
such as are shallow, almest flat, nothing 
that is a cross between pie plate and pud- 
ding pan, which is what the exigency de- 
man(£. Thinking to get out of the dilem- 
ma easily enough I went over to the 
country store and explained the matter to 
the merchant, who would not even stop 
for me to finish before he went off nod- 
ding and smiling, saying he had just what 
I wanted, some pie plates that were deep 
and some that were deeper. There never 
was a man more mistaken in the use of- 
words. All he really had was some that 
were shallow and some others that were 
shallower, and I spent some time trying to 
prove it to him, but as he was German it 
seemed without much success. Then I 
had to come home, take a hammer and 
beat the broad, flat, edges of the pie 
plates we have into a comparative per- 
pendicularity. They look bad but, "what 
can't be cured must be endured," — ^as the 
sailor said when he bade his sweetheart, 
good bye — "so farewell, Susan," etc. 

The very last time I had a talk with 
Mrs. Tingee — we are opposite neighbor's 
and it is common for me to bCcp m of a 
morning — ^just as I was as i thought well 
out of the nouse she stopped me on the 
steps with the usual, "Oh, tell me some- 
thing, now, what can I have for dinner?', 
"Why; Mrs. Tingee,why don't you give 
your boarders some roast iamb? There 
is nothing better ; and as for the price it 
is really no dearer now than mutton or 
the other meat you buy." But, wouldn't 
they eat — " Whatever she may have in- 
tended to say, she did not finish the 
sentence but stopped for a moment and 
then resumed : 

"No ; it is not much trouble about the 
meat part, but it is the something to come 



after. I ought to make them something. 
Day before yesterday I gave them pud- 
ding; yesterday we had nothing and it 
seems as though I ought to have some- 
thing to-day, and it ought to be pie and, 
oh, I do dread to make pie, so!' 

I could plainly see a shiver ran all 
through the poor lady as she said this; 
probably she was thinking of lard and the 
outlay involved in its use. 

"Why not make a custard pie," I said, 
"it does not require much pie paste.' 
"I should want some eggs, shouldn"t 
I?" she asked dubiouslv. ^ 
"Yes; perhaps four.' 
"Couldn't you make it with two, if it 
was you?" 

"How can I tell when I don't know 
how much or how many you are going to 
make." ' 

She gazed away ofif into space for a 
while. There was a mighty argument for 
and against pie going on in her mind. 
Then coming close and looking around 
to see that there were no listeners, she said 
in a low tone : 

"I would not say it to anybody but 
you, but I have one boarder, a young 
man, that actually sometimes eats four 
pieces of pie?" 

So that's what made this poor woman 
shiver. Not the bare reflection upon the 
expensiveness of lard, but the dread of 
this young man's calling heartlessly one, 
two, three, four times for pie ; having her 
in his power; knowing she dared not say 
no, or, "it is all out," while the other 
boarders were, yet to be served and would 
presently be, right before his eyes. I 
think if he had been in my place and real- 
ized what depths of doubt and fear this 
likelihood of his wanting four pieces had 
opened before her he would have swon* 
oil from ever going beyond the second 
order. However, there are extenuating 
circumstances to be mentioned in his 
favor. 

We fellows who make our custard pies 

in all that swaggering, arrogant feeling of, 

boundless wealth that is bom of having 

a plethroic store-room and whole barrels 

full of "stuff' to use out of would 

feel more like pitying than blaming the 

young man who would essay to movt 

around after a four-piece in-vesi-v^^nl of 

I our pies, however good and wholesome,

of sugar and the crust weighs at least 
four ounces more it is within an ounce or 
two of being two pounds weight for each 
custard pie, and though we cut it in the 
smallest pieces, that is m eight, the young 
man who would eat four would almost 
surely feel such discomfort that a pound 
of pie at once would bring its own punish- 
ment ; and I understood Mrs. Tingee to 
say that she cut her's in only six — so much 
the worse for the young man. However, 
in this case I tried to sympa^-hise with 
Mrs. Tingee and offered her the poor 
comfort of saying that everything costs 
and it might as well be custard pie as 
something else ; with which she cautiously 
agreed. 

"But won't it take milk? she asked." 
"Yes, of course." 
"How much, do you think?,* 
Now I verily believe she was thinking j 
spoonfuls while I was thinking guarts, 
but not wishing to alarm her, I said : 
"Oh, about a pint." . 

"But that's for tea," she rephed. 
"Maam?" 
"That's for tea." 
"What, the pie?" 
"No, the milk." 

"Oh! yes, I understand," and did be- 
gin to apprehend her meaning. That is 
just like a woman. I was thinking of a 
pint of milk — any pint of milk — from 
anywhere in the world so that we jzot it; 
she was thinking of the pint of milk, the 
one pint of milkm her cupboard set there 
to be used for the tea at the evening meal 
and, to her the only pint of milk m the 
universe. 

"Well, then," I said, "you need not 
use that ; you can make just as good a 
custard with water." 

"Is that so?" she said, brightening up, 
**have you ever made custard with 
water?" I nodded an affirmative. 

"What ever made you think of trying 
that?" 

"It tried itself, as it were. You see 
when at the Cloverdale Hotel and cot- 
tages in the early part of the season we 
had more milk than we could possibly 
use we made custard pie with cream, and 
of course it was good. As the season 
advanced and the crowd increased we 
got down to skimmed milk and to milk 
muted with water, and still the custard 
pies were apparently as good as before; 



so when it happened, as it will in every 
place sometimes, that there was no milfe 
at all it was but an easy step further to 
make the custard pies with water alone 
and not care whether the cows come 
home or not." 

"And they were every bit as good?" 

"Yes, ma am — apparently." 

"Did you ever hear of anybody using 
flour or starch or anythmg to save eggs?" 

"Oh, yes; there is a rule for that. If 
you have need of four eggs you can mix 
up some flour and water to the consist- 
ency of thick cream and each cooking- 
spoonful of that is equal to one egg, for 
thickening purposes, but it will be white." 

"But ifi use three of that and one egg 
it will look yellow. Well, I must get to 
doing something, for the morning is half 
gone." 

So then I was released, but only for 
a short time, for after dinner Mrs. Tingee 
made me cross the street again. 

"I want you to come and try my cus- 
tard pie," said she. 

"No, thank you — I have had dinner." 

"But you must — tell me whether I did 
right or wrong and what you think of it." 

But the pie she set before me was none 
of mine. I disclaim having anything to 
do with it. ^ My custard pies are big and 
fat — three big cups of custard in each one, 
and there is room to dive down deep in 
them; but this! Oh, Mrs. Tingee how 
could you! It is only the ghost^ the 
shadow, the skeleton of a custard pie. I 
hope she will not ever ask me any more 
questions. Sometimes I feel like pitying 
her, but am always sure to be taken aback 
by some such exhibition of the preternat- 
ural sharpness she has acquired in the 
long battle ot three-and-a-half-a-week. 
In this case — to borrow a simile from 
minister Schenck's book on poker— she 
has seen the hand I held and gone me 
one, ten, aye a hundred better. One of us 
two has been "sold" and it wasn't Mrs. 
T. Her custard pie is primped and 
crimped arpund the edges, but there is 
nothmg of it. It consists of a sheet of 
bottom crust about as thin as paper, with 
a yellow laver of custard about as deep as 
a sheet of Slotting paper upon it. Why, 
three cups of custard would cover "wilds 
immeasurably spread" of paste of such a 
depth as that. With a quart of such cus- 
tard made with no milk but one egg she

could fill pies enough to stock up a 
bakery. I am afraid of her. As for the 
young man who, sometimes eats four 
pieces I may envy him his vigorous ap- 
petite, but 1 utterly despise him for his 
want of taste. Let him go without a 
lecture. Mrs. Tingee is able to cope with 
him alone. In some way or other he gets 
his full punishment, never doubt it.

580— Ham and Eggs, Hotel Style. 

The large dish of ham and eggs served 
at some restaurants as described at No. 
76 as costing 25 cents is not the best dish 
of the kind that can be served. It is 
quantity in that case rather than quality. 

Take the best pieces of ham, the right- 
hand cut shown at No. 552, shave off the 
outside, cut slices very thin the full size 
of the piece — they scarcely ever weigh so 
much as two ounces — and broil over 
a brisk fire. Lay on a good sized platter 
up towards one end and two fried eggs 
partly upon tti ham and partly on the 
dish, if at 18 cents a dozen two eggs 
cost ihrse cents, and two ounces uf choice 
cut of nam worth 24 cents a pound net 
costs 3 cents each dish served counts six 
cents for material. 

581— Stewed Kidneys, or Saute of 
Kidneys. 



stewed, but we have to call them so, 
because of the dazed looks we meet if we 
used any harder words. 

Slice the three or four landneys that 
have been taken from the different meats 
and steep a short time in cold water. Put 
them in a frying pan with a little butter, 
dredge with pepper and salt, and simmer 
slowly over the fire shaking the pan ocr 
casionally. There will be a rich gravy in 
the pan in a few minutes in which the 
kidneys become well cooked and remain 
tender, but if not watched the gravy 

Presently coagulates and the kidneys are 
ard and tasteless. The cooking should 
take place only a short time before the 
meal begins. Add a tablespoonful of 
walnut catsup to the gravy before serving. 

582— MufTins in Haste. 



There are no better mufi^s than the kind 
made according to the directions at Nos. 
102 and 103, but in summer weather and 
with compressed yeast they can be made 
of fine quality in a still shorter time with 
only one rising. Breakfast beginning at 
half past seven, I mix up the muffins at 
six. Take a piece of the light dough that 
was set over-night for rolls or bread, put 
it in a pan, add four yolks, six table- 
spoons melted butter, same of warm milk 
and one tablespoon sugar and pinch of 
salt. Hold the pan over the stove to 
warm the ingredients while you thoroughly 
mix and beat them together. Drop into 
greased gem pans, set m a warm place to 
rise about an hour, then bake.

583~Puree of Tomatoes Soup; 



spoon — better than stirring around. 

There will be five or six quarts. Set it 
on the back part of the stove and as it 
slowly boils up at one side all the grease 
that is in it will collect on the sur&ce at 
the other and must be skimmed off. 
Serve with a few duchess crusts, not put 
in the soup previously, but droype^in th^ 
plates as they are taken in.. 



A -ptiree is a paste or pulp like mashed 
potatoes and a puree soup is one thickened 
by having a puree of vegetables or per- 
haps of fowl or game stirred into it; a 
plain tomato soup may be thin and clear 
enough to show up green peas, rice or 
other additions, but a puree soup is thick, 
more like tomato sauce. These explan- 
ations will do to refer to again. 

The butcher over at "the Glen" would 
sell us a beef shank for 12 or 15 cents, 
but as that is a distance of four miles we 
must either say, "can't make soup," or 
do this way. Take the bone of the short 
loin of beef, (all the meat for steaks hav- 
ing been cut off raw,) the piece of shoulder 
off ttie rib loast, bone out of the veal, 
shanks of mutton, small piece of ham, all 
raw. Wash in cold water, and reject 
every piece that has become stale and 
dark through exposure to the air. Put 
them into a large pot with two gallons of 
cold water and set on to boil between 8 
and 9 o'clock in the morning. Skim 
when it begins to boil. These bones we 
will count worth 10 cents. 

The flavors which "go well" with 
tomatoes are onions, ham, garlic, cloves, 
green and red peppers, allspice, clams, 
lamb, walnut catsup, anchovies. Not to 
be used all at once. 

Into the soup pot you had better put 
one onion, six cloves, piece of turnip and 
carrot and a three pound can of tomatoes 
(15 cents) or fresh tomatoes to that amount 
and let boil with the meat and bones until 
near dinner time, them add flour-and- 
water thickening a spoonful at a time un- 
til it seems thick enough, and season with 
salt and cayenne. The soup is then 
ready to be strained and freed from 
grease. Take a clean soup pot and set 
a strainer over it. A colander-shaped 
stramer at least as fine as a flour seive 
should be used, or one of perforated tin, 
finer still. You can hurry the soup and 
all such mixtures through by rapidly 
striking the strainer ed^e with an iron 



584 — Duchess and Conde Crusted -or 
Croutons. 



Thfese are the names given 6y the 
French to what English cooks call "sip- 
pets of fried bread." Cut bread in thm 
slices without crust, then in dice no larger 
than navy beans. If you diop them for 
a few seconds, into hot clarified butter, 
j oil or lard and fry them light brown they 
are duchess crusts, if, instead, you put 
them in a pan in the oven and bake them 
brown like toast they are conde crusts. 
They are to eat in soup instead of crackers. 



585— Macaroni and Cheese^Ordinary; 



This makes 12 orders at a cost of one 
cent each. 

^ pound macaroni* 

2 ounces cheese— a smalT cup grated or 
minced. 

2 ounces butter-— size of an egg-*, 

I cup milk. 

I spoonful flour thickening., 

I egg, salt, cracker crumbs. 

Set on a saucepan of water and wheirit 
boils put in the macaroni broken in pieces. 
Cook 20 minutes then drain in a colander. 
Get a panpr deep dish that holds about 
three pints, butter it, put in the maca- 
roni, the cheese minced fine and butter 
in small bits, mix them with a fork. 

Break the egg in a bowl, add a cook- 
ing-spoonful of flour thickening and beat 
while pouring in the milk, add it to the 
macaroni, dredge cracker meal over the 
surface and bake until the liquid is set 
and surface brown. 

There should be a little mixed flour and 
thickening, about as thick as cream al- 
ways at hand when cooking is going on. 
The use of a spoonful saves an egg in this 
dish and is better, but do not use enough 
to make the macaroni solid and dry. For

588— Trouble with the Oatmeal. 



Breaidasl^

t 



racked Vheat mush (2 ciipir decked 



The majority of those who board where 
'the oatmeal or cracked wheat mush is 
made regularly and made good soon find 
they cannot make a satisfactory meal 
without it. ^ It is an article of diet es- 
pecially desirable for children. I believe, 
moreover, that more hard work both of 
hands and head can be done, particularly 
in hot weather, upon a diet of oatmeal 
and cream than upon any mixed diet 
of meat and vegetables. I'here are two 
ways of cooking it and the best way is 
difficult and more or less wasteful. There 
is no waste m cooking the oatmeal in a 
fiarina kettle — as the double kettles are 
called — but there is a loss of something 
still. We cooks know by various signs 
when a dish strikes the peoples' fancy, 
and know that the oatmeal and cracked 
wheat that is eaten to the last grain and 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



for which the disappointed "help" after 
the meal want to scrape the kettle clean 
for a dish for themselves is not that which 
is cooked in a farina kettle or steam chest, 
but that cooked in a thick-bottomed 
saucepan slowly at the back of the range, 
where a crust bakes imder and around it 
and the mush gets a baked flavor. I think 
the best way to cook oatmeal mush would 
be the same as Boston baked beans, in a 
jar in the oven, but have never been suf- 
ficiently interested to try it. A cup of 
oatmeal costing two or three cents re- 
quires four cups of water to cook it, and 
makes a quart or two pounds of good 
food. If we make up our minds that it 
is cheap enough to throw away the crust 
that forms in the kettle every time k is 
made, the best quality ban be secured that 
way, provided there is a slow place on 
the range for it to simmer for a couple of 
hours. Such, however, is not the case 
here. The thin stove fired up with light 
wood causes the mush to bum at the 
bottom every other day and the fine baked 
flavor and the fine theories go up in smoke 
together. This will never do. So having 
no farina kettle- and there being none to 
buy at either village, my "sec'* and I have 
hit upon the plan of taking a five-pint 
milk pail with a tight lid and settmg it 
with the oatmeal, previonsiy steeped in 
the requisite quantity of water, inside a 
deep iron pot containing water and so 
boil and steam it, covered with a lid. 
These tea-kettle cooks steam many a loaf 
of brown bread very well by the same 
plan, and could steam a variety of good 
puddings in the same contiivance if they 
only knew how to make them. 

589~Buttered Eggs. 



Break some eggs— about 6 or 8 at a 
time — into a bright saucepan and add for 
each egg a tablespoonful of melted butter 
and very little salt. Have a pan of water 
boiling on the stove; set the saucepan in 
it and stir and beat the eggs until they are 
cooked as thick as scram bled eggs. Serve 
sometimes plain in dishes same as scram- 
bled eggs, sometimes on fajicy toast.

Break the raacaroni and throw 
boiling water, cook 20 minutes. 

Warm the butter and cheese in another 
saucepan and rub them together with a 
spoon, add milk a little at a time as the 
cheese becomes hot, and a pinch of 
cayenne. The mixture must not reach 
the boiling point. Cheese and butter will 
combine when warm and the milk grad- 
ually diluting them makes a thick, creamy 
sauce, but they separate if boiled. Drain 
macaroni and pour the creamed cheese 
over it. Serve it in flat dishes heaped as 
much as possible.

595— Raspberry Shortcake. 



Boys made a bargain with me that I 
should make raspberry shortcake for the 
crowd if they would go and pick the ber- 
ries. Imposed the condition that they 
should bring a gallon. Said they would 
if they could, but it was a week too early 
yet for berries to be plenty. They came 
home at four o'clock in disorder. Had 
been in old Barnacle's woods and the old 
chap and his hired man came up with 
switches and wanted to take the berries 
away from them. Boys called up their 
big dog to defend them and ran home* I 
am under solemn promise "not to tell 
pa." Sorry, for they will be afraid to go 
to Barnacle's to buy eggs, now. They 
brought nearly two quarts red raspberries 
(25 cents.) After looking them over I 
shook a large cup powdered sugar (5 
cents) into them. For the short paste : 

8 level cups flour— 2 pounds. 

2 cups butter — i pound. 

Rub the butter into the flour, after first 
slicing it thin. When well mingled, wet 
with two small cups water. Knead the 
paste smooth, roll out and bake on two 
jelly cake pans or large pie pans if the 
others are not at hand. Split the short- 
cakes when done and spread with berries, 
both inside and on top. Cut in 8. Cost

596— Graham Pocket Book Rolls. 



Graham rolls are a novelty in most 
places and very nice if made like French 
rolls, that is, folded over with a touch of 
butter between, so that they pull open 
when baked. It requires more practice, 
however, to make them of good shape, as 
Graham dough rises faster than white 
and the shapes run out Hat if kept too 
warm. ,0f course the more difficult it is 
to make' such an article the more merit 
and the more of a specialty it is for the 
one who can. Some white flour must 
be mixed with the Graham. The addi- 
tion of the white of an egg to the liquor 
the dou^h is mixed with, is an improve- 
ment — Section No. 261. Use com- 
pressed yeast. Make half in split rolls, 
the rest a loaf of Graham bread.

598— Building a House with Bread 
Crusts. 



or gingerbread work upon them, but the 
meaning is not half so literally intended 
as a remark I heard when old Mr. Stick- 
tite was building the fine view four-story 
Sticktite House at Jknsonvale Junction. 
It was said he built that house with money 
saved by drying the broken pieces of bread 
and crushing them to use instead of 
cracker meal to bread-crumb fried oysters 
and fish and other things. No doubt but 
that particular was but one tangible point 
seized upon to represent a life full of small 
saving ways, by which wealth was ac- 
quired in the long run. But I don't see 
where the harm was in that. Mr. Stick 
tite had the depot eating house and he 
had a large oyster trade besides and he 
was not the man to give grounds for the 
cutting sarcasms which are flung at rail- 
j road eating-house sandwiches, bread and 
rolls. Wtien they became dry — really, 
dry and hard — he, instead 01 palming 
them off upon helpless travelers took them 
off his counters and tables and even out of 
his showcases, had the dark crust shaved 
off and spread them on trays in a warm 
plac cover the oven to become dry enough 
to crush ; then, to keep the boys and girls 
out of mishchief between train times, he 
made them roll and sift the dried bread 
so that it looked like com mealorv^racker 
meal. And some of them could easily 
save their wages that way. It does not 
take long to use up a barrel of cracker 
meal where there is a considerable trade 
in fried oysters or in a hotel where veal 
cutlets and fried mush are breaded every 
day. As our price list of groceries shows 
cracker meal costs exactly the same price 
as new crackers, or seven dollars a hun- 
dred, so a hundred pounds of crushed 
dried bread is worth just that amount. 

But is it as good? is the question. 

Yes, if selected and freed from crust 
before crushing. 

599— Fine Corn Bread. 



We have all heard of gingerbread hous 



Happily for us all this little company 
of people contains no distressful hypo- 
chondriacs nor people with special aver- 
sions. Two harmless hot- water drinking 
lunatics, that's all. But some of them 
have intimated that it is essential to their 
happiness to have com bread for break- 
fast constantly, and baked potatoes; or- 
ders which make those two oishes fixtures

on the bill of fare from this time forth. 
For fine com bread take : 
2 heaping cups com meal. 

1 or 2 ounces butter or la^J-rsize of -an 
egg. 

2 eggs, salt. 

2 teaspoons baking powder.- 

Milk or water to mix. 

Make a hollow in the meal and put in 
the butter and pour in a little boiling 
water from the teakettle to scald part of 
the meal. Thin it down with cola milk, 
add the eggs and salt and lastly the 
powder. Beat it well with spoon or egg 
whip. Have the baking pan hot and not 
greased. If it hisses when the com batter 
IS poured in the bread never sticks. Per- 
fect success with corn bread of this fine 
sort depends on having the batter th3 
proper consistency. It should be like 
thidc batter-cake mixture when poured m 
the baking pan. If just right it will rise 
rounded and smooth and cuts like cake. 
For com bread without eggs, see No. 626.

Piit into 5 quarts of water some soup 
bones and the neck and shanks obtained 
firom the newly arrived side of lamb, 3 or 
4 small green onions, a pinch of thyme 
and savory; boiled an hour and took out 
the pieces of lamb to make the blan- 
guette. An hour later poured the stock 
from the bones through a fine strainer 
into a clean soup pot, and skimmed off 
the fat. 

Boiled half a cup of rice in a small 
saucepan. Made a quart of milk hot 
and mashed the rice with milk added a 
little at a time: put it into the soup stock, 
also a half blade of mace, salt, cayenne, 
a small carrott from seed bed finely 
minced. Let simmer and skimmed again. 
Lastly added a spoonful of thickening, 
half cup of cream and an ounce of butter. 
Costs 4 cents a quart. 



601—Trout, au Gratin. 

Au gratin signifies that the fish is 
gratinated or browned like toast on the 
surface, and therefore, that it is covered 
with bread crumbs. It comes handy to 
express it in that way, as the fish is not 
exactiy breaded as for frying. 

Split the fish in halves and dredge both 
sides with salt and pepper. Put a spoon- 
ful of drippings into your baking pan and 
let it get hot. Dip the skin side of the 
sides of fish in either milk or egg, and 
then in cracker meal or crumbs and place 
in the pan with the breaded side up. 
Bake it brown and baste once with butter. 
Divide neatly in pieces with a sharp 
knife. Serve either sauce, gravy, or 
potato balls with it. 

602— Blanquette (or White Dish) of 
Lamb with Fried Crusts. 



This was the first appearance of the 
lamb in any form at this table and the 
littie entree was quite sure to be in re- 
quest; and although but a trifle to fill the 
bill it served as a premonition to the 
boarders of more lamb to come. 

Took the pieces of lamb cooked in the

soup stock, cut into large dice. Boiled 
a ladleful of stock with teasfwonful 
minced onion, put the cut meat in and 
seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Made white sauce of ladleful of the 
finished soup (to save time) with cream, 
butter, thickening and scrap broken nut- 
meg and a tablespoon of mushroom cat- 
sup (private stock from the cook's valise) 
and poured it to the lamb. Serve with 
cut shapes of fried bread for border and 
a sprinkling of green peas. 

603— Fancy Shapes of Fried Bread. 



These may be very ornamental if fried 
to a clean, bright yellow-brown color in 
the clear oil of butter or in lard. Cut slices 
of bread m diamond shapes or six sided 
and cut out the middle, then divide by 
a cut across and you have a border for 
each end of the dish and the filling will 
be in the middle, or, cut thin slices and 
then take a scollop-edge cutter and cut 
out crescent shapes and fry them.

Supper. 



Bought wild raspberries at 12 cents a 
quart. Meringne is best made with cake 
as at Nos. 195, and 395, but having paste

bread, sugar 15. 

Total, $1 74; 25 persons; 7 cents a 
plate. 

606— Broiled Pickerel with French 
Potatoes. 



Pickerel is a firmer fish than Mackinaw 
trout, less oily than whitefish and pre- 
ferred by many. Split by cutting down 
both sides of the back bone. Cut each 
half in three or four, dip in flour, put in 
the hmged wire broiler, broil both sides 
and brush with butter. Serve with a few 
crisp "Francaise" potatoes in the plate. 



607— Butter Rolls. 

Sometimes called tea cake, and also 
Sally Lunn. 

2 pounds light bread dough. 
I ounce sugar—a spoonful. 
4 ounces butter— J^ cup. 

3 yolks of eggs. 

I teacup milk or cream. 

1 pound flour to work in. 

Take the doughy already light, 4 hours 
before the meal, mix in all the mgredients. 
Let rise 2 hours. Knead, then make the 
dough into round balls and roll them flat. 
Brush over with melted butter and place 
two of the flats together, one on the other. 
Press in the center. Rise an hour, and 
bake. When done, slip a thin shaving of 
fresh butter inside each and brush the 
top over slightly, too. Should be made 
very small if to serve whole, or as large 
as saucers, to cut. Makes 8 large enough 
to cut in 4. Cost buttered 20 cents.

608— Raspberries and Cream. 

Serve the berries in glass plates or ice 
cream saucers individually, quite plain, 
with powdered sugar and cream on the 
table. 

609— Good White Cake. 



A great deal of the fuss and labor some 
people go through every time a white 
cake is to be made is altogether needless: 
to prove it try this easy cake and be sur- 
prised: that it can be put together so 
quickly : 

2 cups sugar — a pound. 

I cup melted butter — ^ pound. 

10 wnites of eggs. 

1 cup milk. . . 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 
I teaspoon cream tartar. 

6 cups flour— I ^ pounds. 

Put the sugar ana melted butter into 
the mixing pan along with the whites, not 
whipped, then take the wire egg beater 
and beat them together a minute or two; 
add the milk, powder, cream tartar and 
flour and some flavoring extract if you 
choose, and beat it up with a spoon thor- 
oughly. The more it is beaten the whiter 
and finer the cake. If there is no cream 
tartar handy use the juice of a lemon. 
Makes nearly 4 pounds; costs 34 cents. 
Ought to be frosted the easy way. No. 3; 
or, with frosting that will slice without 
breaking. No. 635.

610— Fish Fried Plain. 



Dip the pieces in flour only and drop 
into a saucepan of lard hot enough to hiss. 
All the smaller kinds of fish and those 
most esteemed for their flavor such as 
brook trout and whitebait are best fried 
that way, and it is suitable for all kinds 
if they are cut in thin pices. 



611— Calf s Liver Breaded and Fried 



Cut thin slices, pepper and salt them, 
dip in a little milk m a saucer (not to 
wash the seasoning away) then in cracker 
meal in which a little flour has been mixed. 
To make it a better color the liver had 
better be dipped twice giving it a double 
breading, otherwise it comes out dark. 
Drop into a frying pan of hot drippings 
or lard, and fry. Serve either plam or 
with a slice of broiled bacon. 

612— Potatoes Francaise. 



Cut potatoes raw with a fluted or scol- 
loped knife, (there are knives made for the 
purpose) in thm strips the length of the 
potato, and drop them a few at a time into 
a saucepan of hot lard or drippings. 
When they rise from the bottom and 
float, they are dene. Take up in a col- 
ander set in a plate. Sprinkle with fine 
salt and a little minced parsely and serve 
hot and crisp. The fat should not be 
very hot for these as if fried too quickly 
the potatoes turn soft after taking up.

613— Italian Soup. 



4 quarts soup stock (obtained as at No» 
582.) 

I quart milk. 

4 ounces macaroni broken small. 

I cup cooked lamb, veal or chicken cut 
small. 

I cup mixed vegetables same way. 

Chopped parsely or other green herb or 
vegetable. 

Salt, cayenne, thickening. 

It is a white soup with macaroni, etc., 
in it. Strain off the stock, skim free from 
grease, put in the vegetables and maca- 
roni and afterwards the cut meat and 
milk. When lamb is boiled the broth 
has a milky appearance and it is advisa- 
ble to make white soup of that material. 



614— Beet Greens. 

Take the leaves of young beets, throw 
away the thick stalks, wash the leaves 
and keep in cold water. Shortly before 
dinner put them into a pot of boiling 
water in which throw a lump of baking 
soaa size of a bean. The greens cook in 
about half an hour. Drain in a colander. 
Season with salt and corned beef fat or 
butter and cut them small in the pan. 



615— Rice with Cream, 



Wash half a cup of rice and put it to 
boil in a cup of water with a lid on. When 
nearly dry add half a cup of milk and 
little salt. When done mix in a half a 
cup of cream. Serve same as a vefi;etable 
in deep dishes. 

616— Puddings without Eggs. 



At Cedar Point Cottage on Nipantuck 
Island, one day I found Mary Jane in a 



state of great perturbation ; she was sit- 
ting on the edge of a washtub, her face 
very red and with her wetted thumb she 
was turning over the leaves of a cook 
book at a rapid rate. 

"I don't know what to g.ve 'em," she 
said. 

"What's the matter?" 

"Pudding: Them fifteen boarders will 
be here in less than an hour as hungry as 
go-its, and they won't think they've had 
any dinner if there don't be pudding 
every day." 

"Well," I said, "you know there are 
some kinds can be made in a few min- 
utes," and I looked to see whether her 
fire was good. 

"I know," she returned, "yes, I know 
lots, but all the dratted puddings seems 
to want eggs and there isn't an egg on the 
I island this blessed day." 

"Oh, that's the trouble ; then why not 
try this," and I pointed out No. 176. 

"Theieit is again," says Mary Jane, 
"that*s cherry pudding and where would 
I get the chemes?" 

"Don't you see that what is good for 
one kind of fruit is good for any other kind? 
That receipt shows the way they mg.ke 
the steamed apple pudding or apple rolls 
as they call it at some high-priced city 
restaurants; for never an egg do they use 
for puddings at some of thosj places; they 
chop the apples small and use the same 
as that says to use cherries." 

"And would these blackberries do that 
I was going to make pie of and didn't find 
time?" 

"Of course they will, and it only takes 
about five minutes and your pot there is 
boiling and there is the steamer hanginjg 
up clean and ready and you must do this 
way, use a large pie plate, and be sure 
not to have the layers of dough too thick 
because they rise so much that the pud- 
ding will seem to have too little fruit if 
you do. It will be all the better for being 
made late and being served as soon as it is 
done." 

By that time Mary Jane's perplexity 
was all over, and when the time came to 
change those fifteen plates she had ready 
for them as fine a pudding as you would 
wish to meet on a summer day. For an- 
other class of puddings without eggs see 
Nos. 631, 639, 652, 594 and index.

617~Chocolate Butter Pie without 
Eggs. 



The same as No. 577 with a small cup 
of grated chocolate added to the milk 
when put on to boil with the butter in it. 
Chocolate flavor is not good in combin- 
ation with eggs, but it is with butter and 
cream. Chocolate custard frozen is not 
much esteemed, but chocolate with pure 
cream is one of the favorite ices. So this 
chocolate butter pie is the best flavored 
compound of the sort that can be made. 
If wanted as good as it can be, use a pound 
of sugar and half a pound of butter to a 
quart of milk and four ounces flour and 
the cup of chocolate. Makes three pies 
large and deep, each to cut in eight. 

Supper. 



Discouraged landloard. Twelfth of 
July gone and still "nobody in the 
nouse, comparatively speaking. 

Some very fine people sure to come

618— Lamb and Potato Stew, or Gal- 
limaufry. 

This is said by one of our French 
authors to be the ancient dish of gal- 
limaufry a la Languedocienne. It does 
not hurt anybody to eat it, however, and 
only costs 10 or 12 cents with all its 



wealth of name thrown m. 

Take some pieces of cold lamb ; about 
I pound of clear meat will do and it may 
be the neck or shoulder that was boiled 
until just done in the soup boiler. Shave 
off the dark portions and cut the meat in 
laige dice. Cut an equal amount of raw 
potatoes the same way and put both on 
to boil with clear broth or water barely 
to cover. Put in a small onion cut up 
and if to be true to name a clove of garlic 
and sprig of green thyme and little chop- 
ped parsley. When it has sttwed until 
the potatoes are done, season with pepper 
and salt and thicken it slightly if' the 
potatoes have not boiled away and thick- 
ened it alreadv. It is a neat looking little 
stew and good for a family supper. 



619— Chelsea Buns, without Eggs. 



One of the sweetest warm breads that 
serve in place of cake when there are no 
eggs to be had. 

Take nearly half the dough that is 
mixed up for French rolls and work into 
it a few currants. Roll it out to a very 
thin sheet, brush over with softened but- 
ter, sprinkle sugar all over, then cut the 
dough into ribbons and coil them into 
spiral buns. Place with plenty of room 
between in a buttered pan, rise an hour 
and bake. Sugar over when done. For 
exact proportions, see No. 267. That 
variety is like currant rolls, these are flat 
coils.

620~-Lamb Chops and Toast. 



Lamb chops are tedious, being small, 
but make a choice dish for a Sunday 
breakfast. As, in order to make a chop 
worth having of the ribs it is necessary to 
cut two ribs to each, take out one bone and 
leave all the meat on the other, there can 
be but few, to serve to the most honor- 
ably select, the main dependence for 
quantity is in cutting up the entire loin 
and perhaps the leg. Flatten with the 
cleaver. Trim and shape all as near like 
rib chops as may be. Cut little pieces of 
buttered toast very thin and in pear shape. 
Place one in the dish, a broiled chop 
leaning upon it, another piece of toast 
and another chop — all on an end aslant 
in the dish— and garnish with parsley or 
cress or yoimg seed-bed celery.

623— German Puffs, Flannel Rolls, 
Muffins or Popovers. 

It makes a great difference whether any 
dish or product of skill is the present 
fashion or not. We have all heard of 
somebody's popovers and come across 
remarks in the farmers' papers about 
somebody else's popovers that wouldn't 
I)op, without wanting any in ours par- 
ticularly. So when I saw that Mary Jane, 
at Cedar Point Cottage, on Nipantuck 
Island had a stove-full of very fine ones 
ready for supper I admired them, and 
told her they were splendid and she ought 
to be proud that she could make them 
(as indeed she was) without yet caring to 
get the receipt for my books; having so 
many good yeast-raised fancy breads al- 
ready; and, besides, I had heard Mrs. 
Trngee condemn popovers on account of 
theu- using up her eggs too last and not 
being very good eating anyhow. 

"But that isn't what we call 'em," said 
Ma^ Janes, "them's flannel rolls." 

They are popovers, Mary Jane," I 
persisted; "did you never hear of pop- 
overs, and popovers that wouldn't pop?" 

;*The baker at the Nipantuck House 
called em flannel rolls," said she, "and 
1 guess he knew and he brought me the 
receipt before he went away." She heaved 
a little sigh and turned away as if there 
was nothing more to be said on that 
question. 

Afterwards, upon the very voluminous 
breakfast and supper bills of fare of a 
very large summer hotel I found printed 
."Kaaterskill Flannel Rolls,"and in think- 
mg over what they might be, naturallv 
reverted to that stove-full of "flannel rolls^' 
on Nipantuck Island, and learning almost 
immediately that the Grand Pacific was 
serving them as "mufiins," the Palmer 
House as "German puffs" and the Mat- 
teson as "flannel rolls," I began to feel 
like a collector of coins, who has heard of 
a date that is not in his collection, or Uke 
one of those Dutch tulip fanciers when 
they heard of a new color, and startedout 
to catch up with the procession. I soon 
overtook my friend the steward of the 
Matteson who, for the good of the pubUc 
handed me this: take 

a eggs. 

2 cups milk— a pint. 



2 cups flour — lo ounces. 

Salt, a small teaspoon. 
^ Break the eggs into a bowl; beat them 
light and keep adding the milk to them 
gradually while your are beating. That 
takes about five minutes. Add the salt. 
When all the milk is in put in the flour, 
all at once, and beat it smooth, like 
cream. Butter the inside of six coffee 
cups, divide the batter into them and 
bake in a moderate oven about half an 
hour. 

It is to be observed there is no powder 
nor raising of any kind in them and no 
butter, yet they rise high above the tops 
of the cups and are hollow inside when 
done. They are not perfect if jnade with 
skimmed milk. When they collapse in 
the cups and come out tough and heavy 
it is owing to the baking, the stove being 
not hot enough on the bottom, or, pos- 
sibly not havmg been thoroughly beaten. 
I have made large batches and baked 
so;ne for early breakfast and beaten the 
same batter again and baked it two hours 
later and found the last to be as good as 
the first. 

Cost, 6 cents. But the cups are not 
the best for a number, holding too much. 
There are deep gem pans shaped like 
small tumblers that suit better to bake in. 
These are a pleasing kind of bread to 
make, their remarkable lightness making 
them always something of a marvel. 



Breakfast. 



Crackec 



bracked wheat mush (2 cups raw. %

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



624— Plain Rolls. 

For 30 rolls dissolve i cent's worth of 
yeast in 2 cups of milk or water, warm 
but not hot, add a teaspoonful of salt 
and stir in the flour enough to make 
dough (2 lbs, 6 cents.) It is just as good 
made up in dough at first as if a sponge 
was set, (that is, making a soft-batter first, 
and working it up into dough afterwards,) 
the part that makes the most difference 
in quality, is the proper kneading of the 
dough which should be as for coffee 
cakes, No. 262. If made up over night, 
the dough will be light in the mommg. 
Knead it well, make up in roimd rolls, 
touch between each one with a brush 
dipped in melted butter to cause them to 
separate easily when done. Rise an hour 
and bake. 

The rolls will have a thin and soft crust 
and will be much better looking if they 
are brushed over the tops with a very lit- 
tle lard or butter when they are first 
placed in the pan. It takes away the 
rough and floury appeaiance of common 
bread. 



625~Plain Bread. 



The same as plain rolls preceding. 
That quantity, makes 2 loaves. A par- 
ticularly sweet home made Vienna bread 
is made by giving the bread only one 
rising: mixmg with milk, compressed 
yeast and salt at, say, 3 in the afternoon, 
making up into loaves at 6 and puttmg m 
the oven almost as soon, or in 15 or 20 
minutes. Brush over with milk after 
baking. 

626— Corn Bread without Eggs. 

It is as light and soft and smooth- 
crusted as wheat bread. 

i^ cups com meal. 

54 cup flour. 

I tablespoon sugar. 

5^ teaspoon soda ; same of salt. 

4 tablespoons melted butter or lard. 

Sour milk or buttermilk enough to mix 
it up about as thin as batter cakes. 

Beat up well with the spoon. Bake it 
in a shallow pan. - Have the pan hot and 
greased before pouring it in. 



Baking powder and sweet milk can be 
used as well. 

The same can be raised with yeast. 
Makes 12 to 16 orders ; costs about 5 cents. 

627— Yeast Kaised Batter Cakes 
Without Eggs. 

3 cups flour. 

2 cups warm water. 

y2 cup yeast— or i cent's -worth-com- 
pressed. 

I tablespoon melted lard. 

Same of synjpr— (to make them brown 
easily.) 

J4 teaspoon salt. 

Mix ail the ingredients together like 
setting sponge for bread — with very cold 
water if made over night for breakfast, 
or else 6 hoturs before the meal with warm. 
Beat thoroughly both at time of miTing 
and just before baking. 

Cold weather prevails: "it rains and 
the wind is never weary. The 'bus will 
not go to the trains to-day. The driver has 
started with a wagon to a distant town to 
buy brick wherewith to build two chim- 
neys in the cottages occupied by the 
shivering guests of the house, that they 
may have fires. At present they are 
huddled around the dining room fire- 
place. Hope they have some among 
them "whose smiles can make a sum- 
mer," for we need one, badly. 



Hard Times Dinner. 



But it was all good, and nobody would 
ever suspect that there was a paucity of 
material or omission of the usual in- 
gredients.

Roast beef (rib ends, 15^ lbs, 15 cents.)

5 tablespoons barley. 

I cupful minced vegetables. 

I ounce butter. 

Salt ; cayenne. 

It is a white soup suitable to 'be made 
with mutton or lamb. To obtain the stock 
boil any spare pieces of meat in 5 quarts 
of water for 2 hours. Put in a small tur- 
nip, onion and carrot, and stalk of celery. 
Strain, skim, add the milk. Boil the 
barley separately. A teaspoonful to each 
quart is enough. Pour off the bluish 
barley water and put the barley in the 
soup. Mince a few spoonfuls of differ- 
ent colored vegetables, such as string 
beans, young carrots, white turnips, green 
onions, add them to the soup and boil 
half an hour. Skim while boiling. Sea- 
son and add butter. 



629^Macaroni and Cheese 
Eggs, 



without 



*•! never could understand,^ safidlfc. 
Tingee, one day, "how the Italians can 
be so poor, as the papers say they are, 
and yet eat so much macaroni as the pa- 
pers tell us they do: I should think it 
would break them up buying eggs to cook 
it with. But then," she added reflectively, 
"sometimes the papers say things that 
ain't so. Do you cook macaroni some- 
times?" 

"Yes ma'am, quite often.** 

"Do you put cheese in it?* 

"Yes." 

"And eggs?" 

"Yes : and butter tend milk and toma- 
toes and gravy and oysters and chicken 
and many more things." 

"Ah; I had a girl once who wanted to 
make a dish of macaroni and I kept lay- 



ing off to get the things together, but, 
somehow, I never did. Do you know, 
a fHend of mine told me she once knew 
a hotel cook who never made a dish of 
macaroni without putting eight eggs in it ! 
Do you think that v/as true?" 

"Yes, ma'am ; and I have no doubt but 
that there are hotel cooks who will even 
use as many as twelve, or thirteen." 

Then Mrs. Tingee said, "O, myl" 

It is a singular trait in this lady that 
she never seems to regard the difierence 
between a dish for two hundred people 
and a dish for two or three; all she sees 
is the eight eggs gone at one fell swoop. 

I venture the opinion that the Italians 
eat macaroni alone or in soup or gravy 
without much thought of cheese and 
without any thought of eggs, and I doubt 
very much whether many 01 them would 
touch the dry and heavy cake of macaroni 
and cheese that is seen at many hotel 
tables in this country. There is a good 
example of an Italian way of preparing 
macaroni, spaghetti, lassagnes, ndilim 
and other such pastes at our No. 65; 
which requires neither eggs nor butter, 
and here is another just as good : 

5^ pound macaroni. 

2 or 3 ounces cheese— or a grated cup- 
ful. 

3 or 4 basting spoonfuls of fat from the 
roasting meat. 

2 cups water or milk. 

2 spoonfuls flour thickening. 

A handful of crushed crackers. 

•Boil the macraoni 20 minutes, then 
pour off the water. Put in the cheese and 
other ingredients and salt ; turn it into a 
2-quart pan. strew the crushed crackers 
on top and bake brown. 

The flour thickening added is to form 
a sort of sauce in it, but not enough to 
cake to the macaroni together. When 
there is a suitable sauce or gravy ready at 
hand it can be used to good advantage 
in that way. The strained gravy firom a 
chicken stew, for example. Cost, 9 or zo 
cents for 12 dishes.

and rice both into the milk and let boil 
in a saucepan at the back of the stove 
with the steam shut in. Never stir it

Warm the buiter and stir it and the 
sugar together until well mixed, then add 
the nulk and a little flavoring of nutmeg, 
lemon, vanilla or cinnamon. 

Mix the powder in the flour, stir all 
together. It makes a stiff batter. The 
more it is beaten up with the spoon the 
better the cake. 

To make it as white as if made with 
white of eggs, one cup of the milk used 
should be sour, or else add a small tea- 
spoon of cream tartar — tlje same thing 
that makes "angel food cake" so white. 
Brush the top with milk before baking.

635— Cake Frosting without Eggs. 

It is not necessary to Lave white of 
eggs to make cake icing or frosting. A 
better kind of frosting that will not break 
when the cake is sliced, is made of either 
dissolved gelatine or powdered gum 
arable. 1 hey need only be dissolved in 
boiling water to make a mucilage like the 
common bottle mucilage in thickness, 
then beat up sugar in it just the same as 
with white of eggs. It is quicker to make 
than the egg kind and is extremely white. 
If too thick on the cakes, set them in a 
warm place and this kind of frosting will 
run down smooth and ^Igssy. There is a 
powdered kind of gelatine called granu- 
lated, that is very good for this purpose.

Dinner. 

Dinner ordered an hour earlier. Two 
lady boarders arrived. The firm of 
Duke and Diamond intend to make 
much of their vacation from city business 
and will take a sail with all the ladies on 
board around the lake. Looks like an 
exploration : Perhaps there is business 
m It. It may be there is to be no more 
dependence upon the patronage of friends 
and acquaintances, but an advertisement 
to the great pleasure-seeking public of 
the claims of this plaoe. However, the 
dinner will not be much regarded and 
must be short and easy.

size; also two green onions, a summer 
squash and a small green cucumber; or 
whatever of the kindcan be obtained, all 
cut small, and about three cupfuls in all 
to five quarts. Boil the vegetables a few 
minuted in water. Season the consomme 
with salt and cayenne, and add two 
tablespoons of walnut catsup. Drain off 
the water from the vegetables and put 
them in'.o the consomme. A heapmg 
teaspoonful of starch mav be used to 
thicken it slightly. Let it Doil until clear

638— Beets in Sauce. 

Boil blood beets in plenty of water from 
one to two hours. Try with a fork. Put

water and one part vinegar. Boil, add 
salt, a little butter, and flour thickening. 



2 cups milk — a pint. 

2 heaped teaspoons baking powder. 

5 cups flour— 1 1^ pounds. 

2 teaspoons ground cinnamon. 

I teaspoon each of cloves and allspice. 

Warm the butter; stir up the sugar and 
milk. Put the powder and spices in the 
flour, mk all and beat up well. Bake in 
shallow tins and frost over when done» 
Before baking brush over the top of each 
cake with milk; it glazes them, and 
makes smooth crust.

4 cups milk — a quart. 

2 heaping tablespoons sugar. 

4 do com starch — 4 ounces good

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. 

Mbc the starch with a little cold milk, 
thin it with some hot out of the kettle,pour 
it quickly into the boiling milk ancf stir 
while it is thickening, which it does im- 
mediately. 

Throw in the butter and beat up, then 
add the yolk of egg thinned with milk, 
and take it from the fire. An extremely 
easy and simple pudding and excellent. 
Must not be kept too hot after cooking 
as that causes it to turn thin. Serve with 
sauce.

A great favorite : Looks like chocolate 
cake. Would not be any better if made 
with eggs. 

I small cup sugar — 6 ounces.

641— A Pasfry and Store Room Neces- 
sary. 

It took about two weeks at this house 
to get a little room fixed up with a few 
shelves to keep certain kinds of stores upon 
and a table m the same room for the 
bread-making pastry, although I had 
made temporary arrangements of the kind 
on the very first day, being allowed to 
gently pitch a lounge and rocking chair 
out of the window of a little room adjoin- 
ing the kitchen for the purpose, li one 
person with very little help is going to get 
up a great number and succession of 
dishes week after week and always "get 
there" as soon as the clock does, give 
every guest their orders according to their 
taste, keep nobody waiting and never 
omit to prepare every sauce, stuffing, 
ornament and trimmings which the bill 
of fare promises, the track must be 
cleared of obstructions and every thing 
placed so that it can be picked up in 
passing whenever it is wanted. Then it 
IS all easy, and, as somebody expressed it 
here yesterday, "it is fun to cook." But 
to have things as they had them here 
last year would make life a burden and 
take twice as many hands to prepare 
meals of half the dimensions that we ex- 
pect to serve; with the meats at the bot- 
tom of the house, the sugar at the top, 
the oatmeal across the way, the vegeta- 
bles down the alley, the baking powder 
locked up in a cupboard and ' the keys 
running around somewhere in some- 
body's pocket; the flour in a comer of 
the kitchen and all the pastry table and 
work place being a board on a barrel. 
These are the misarran^ements which 
make Mary Jane seem so inefficient, and 
she herself does not know what is the 
matcerthat she cannot get along with-

culinary departments and all the loose 
ends bringing together where hands can 
be laid upon them without waste of time, 
and want something better in the way of 
a work table for the cook than a mere 
board on a barrel. 



642— A Board on a Barrel. 

Which reminds me that it is better to 
be bom lucky than rich. How many 
lucky rascals there are wherever there is 
a good hotel, not really deserving more 
than stale bread and butter, who manage 
to get either by audacity, favoritism or 
some petty terrorism of influencing trade 
a living that a king might envy, the first, 
best and dearest of everything that comes 
to market; and how many deserving- but 
unlucky rich people there are in pnvate 
homes who never know what it is to have a 
really good meal. One such family living 
in a small city in the Delectable Moun- 
tains, on a certain occasion employed me 
to get up a "Mother Hubbard party" 
supper for fifty. 

These good people had an income from 
a fortune of two hundred thousand dol- 
lars; they were amiable, generous to an 
extreme ; the lady was sunshine itself in 
spite of poor meals; they deserved really, 
to live in a good hotel and enjoy the best 
of cookery and yet in fact they had noth- 
ing but Mary Jane and a kitchen, that 
was little more than a board on a barrel. 
As for my own three days' work that did 
not concern me, for I had a separate room 
and everything needful, but then I could 
see the gentleman was not happy. He 
was intended by nature to be a man of a 
large and portly presence ; the frame was 
broad, but there was not much upon it ; 
his vest was not filled out and could not 
be with such poor cooking as a board on 
a barrel affords. I could not see withouc 
some concern their Mary Jane trying to 
broil large and thick beelsteaks over the 
holes of a stove filled with soft coal, doing 
the same thing three times each day and 
sending them in half cooked, halt raw, 
blackened with coal smoke, dirty, Car- 
lot croquettes she tried to make and they 



melted down in the grease, (not hot 
enough) and were sent in that way, soft 
and disgusting and a dozen such blunders 
or more I should have liked to correct but 
the contract would have been too large, 
and, besides, there was no convenience. 
When their Mary Jane made^ bread she 
mixed up a pan of dough, using for her 
table a board set on top of the oarrel of 
flour. When she wanted a handful of 
flour she had to set the pan over on the 
dish sink and remove the board, and then 
set them back again— and it was a fine 
painted, grained and ornamented kitchen 
too — and^^when she made rolls she could 
not knead the dough, but seized a hand- 
ful, squeezed it and pinched off the little 
dumpling shape that rose up out of her 
fist. Well, they were not very bad rolls, 
and not very good ; just the commonest 
of the common although the people were 
rich and might as well have had the 
finest; and neither Mary Jane nor I could 
roll out the pastry on a board on a barrel 
that tipped over. 

We may take Mr. Toots' view of such 
a matter saying, "it's of no consequence," 
for health and strength may be kept up 
on very plain food, if one will be an as- 
cetic ana philosopher, but that is what very 
few will be. in this family were four 
daughters, young ladies for whose pleasure 
this party was given, and the mischief ol 
the situation is, that having grown up with 
nothing better before their eyes they will 
go out to their own housekeeping think- 
ing that a board on a barrel is all that is 
needed to set up a kitchen, and that the 
miserable ways of Mary Jane which 
they have seen are the ways they must 
remember and carry on as all that is 
necessary to know about cooking. 

Finding these good people inclined to 
liberality in the matter of expenditure, 
when sending for some Liebig's extract 
ot meat, wherewith to make their bouillon 
of extra fineness, I sent lor twice as much 
as was needed that some might remain to 
give them pleasure some other day ; the 
same by the finest salad oil, the walnut 
catsup to give a new zest to their soups ; 
mushroom catsup to transform their 
chicken stews and pies; genuine table 
sauces to help ameliorate those dreadful 
beefsteaks; some kirchwasser for the 
ladies' punch ; genuine maraschino to im- 
plant a new sensation for them in the' 
, creams and jellies; a few truffles to cause

them to ask questions ; Camembert cheese 
in tiny round boxes; Roquefort cheese 
in larger bulk; biscuits ot the superfine 
sorts and choice fruits, all in excess of 
the needs of the one night. After the 
supper was over I had the satisfaction of 
seeing the remainders of the goods^ and 
sweets with the unwonted flavors spirited 
away to secure hiding places by fairy 
fingers, and then had to leave these poor 
two-hundred-thousand-dollar people to 
the maladministrations of Mary Jane 
with her board on a barrel; but they 
seemed to deserve a better fate. 



Supper. 

Cracked wheat (2 cups, 4 cents.) 

Beefsteak (7 orders, i lb, and biAter,

While it is in preparation, make a cup- 
ful ot cream sauce ; beat in a small lump 
of butter additional, then drain the water 
from the beef and pour the sj»nce over it 
instead. 



644— Sally Lunn Tea Cakes. 



If you are making rolls or bread daily, 
for the evening meal it will be easy to 
change the dough into sally lunn. Make 
up the dough at, say, 11 o'clock, the same 
as at No. 532 and let it rise until 3. Then 
take nearly all, or 2}^ pounds, or .«; or 6 



cups of the dough. 

Yz cup butter, melted. 

3 tablespoons sugar 

2 eggs and 2 yolks. 

^ cup warm milk. 

2 cups .lour. 

Work them all together and beat up 
very thoroughly. It is like mufiin dougn 
or fritters, too soft to handle. 

Let rise until 5. Beat again. Divide 
it in 4 or 5 pie pans previously buttered 
and nse Half an hour, then bake and have 
them hot and ready at 6. Cut like pieces 
of pie carefully with a sharp kniie not 
to crush it. Send it in instead of rolls. 
Makes 24 to 28 cuis; costs 20 or 21 cents.

6 cups. 

Warm the butter and mix it and the 
sugar together and then the milk (water 
will do.) Mix the powder in the flour, 
stu- all together. Roll out very thin. 
Shake some granulated sugar over the 
sheet of dough, cut out and bake well 
done. Costs 17 or 18 cents for about 100 
cookies.

Make soup stock by boiling soup 
bones and a bunch of vegetables and 
spoonful of tomatoes in five quarts of 
water. Strain through a napkin or Cne 
seive. Skim off all the fat. Boil again, 
season, thicken slightly with a table- 
spoonful of starch. Boil gently until it 
again becomes clear and skim well. 
Boil separately 4 ounces macaroni un- 
til half done (10 minutes), drain, and as 
It lies in the colander cut it into very 
short pieces all of one size. Rinse it off 
with hot water to get rid of crumbs and 
drop it in the clear soup to finish cooking. 
Lamb should not be used for clear soups 
as it makes a whitish stock. Use little 
burnt sugar to color if necessary. 

649— Tiouble with the Corned Beef. 



An old friend of mine, went as steward 
to open the new and splendid Winnipeg- 
away House at Red Lake Falls, and when 
I arrived there a week or two after and 
asked "how's everything" he said, rather 
sorrowfully that everythmg was all right, 
"except — blame the luck — !" 

I thought he was going to say the drain- 
age or climate or railroad connections or 
something large, but, after all it is the 
small troubles that are hardest to bear- 
he said he couldn't get a bit of corned 
beef fit to put on the table, and he had 
all the directors of the new concern there, 
hawk-eved and exacting to the smallest 
particulars; just as is always the case 
whilst a new hotel is the new toy of a 
company. 

They had salt beef but it would not 
turn to that pink or scarlet color which 
you like to see — a streak of pink and a 
streak of fat— upon a bed of pale green 
boiled cabbage for your New England 
boiled dinner ; for plain salt beef turns 
dark, almost black after slicing, and has 
something of the depressing effect upon 
the diner of a cloudy day. It was not 
only their own which they had tried to 
pickle, but the village butcher's was 
equally poor. 

It is saltpeter that gives the required 
color. They had both employed salt- 
peter. They were a good way from a 



^3 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



large town, but both had obtained their 
stores from the same place. Told the 
steward that I thought I used to know 
that there are two sorts of saltpeter, but 
it does not make any difference if you 
make sure to get the large crystals, size 
of your thumb, look like washmg soda or 
alum. That which they had used was 
small like common salt. We obtained 
the right article the next day, made new 
brine according to the following receipt ; 
dropped some beef in it while it was warm 
— almost hot — and in twelve hours there- 
after used some of the thin pieces that 
boUed as red as a painted town. 



650— Corned Beef Brine. 



6 gallons water — nearly 3 pailfuls. 

3 to 6 ounces saltpeter, in water. 

I pint sugar. 

10 pounds coarse salt. 

Boil the above all together and skim 
while it is boiling. Pour it into two stone 
jars or a keg or barrel. The jars are best 
m places where there are pieces of beef 
unsuitable for roasting, to be rolled up 
and tied in shape and dropped in every 
day, one jar to receive the fresh additions 
and the other to use out of that which is 
sufficiently corned. 

For this use the larger Quantity of salt- 
peter is needed. Beef dropped in this 
pickle will be ready for use in a week. 

But when a quarter of beef is to be cut 
up and put down in brine to remain in it | 
a very longtime, 3or 4 ounces of saltpeter 
is sufficient. The barrel should be kept 
in a cool, dry cellar. Put a board on top 
of the meat and a rock upon that. Keep 
covered. 



WhDe they are cooking soften 4 ounces 
of butter, squeeze in the juice of half a 
lemon, add a dust of cayenne, a table- 
spoonful chopped parsley or other green 
and spoonful of water. Serve the sweet- 
breads hot from the broiler with sauce 
poured over and garnish of lemon and 
parsley or seed-bed celery. 

Anything cooked a la maitre d'hotel 
has a combination of green herbs with an 
acid; it may be in butter or in thin white 
sauce. 



652 — Tapioca Pudding without Eggs, 

Costs 10 or 12 cents or i cent each 
order. 

1 heaping cup tapioca — ^ lb. 
4 cups milk — a quart. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 
Small lump of butter. 

Take half the milk and put the tapioca 
in it lo soak in a little pan set in a rather 
warm place for an hoiu: or two. BoU the 
rest ofthe milk with the sugar and butter 
in it, put in the tapioca, stir up, pour into 
a buttered pan and bake half an hour. 
It is, of course, quite white. Serve with 
any pudding sauce. One egg or tw o yolks 
may be added if wished to have it richer. 
The e^ must not be boiled in the milk, 
but stirred in just before putting in the 
oven. 



651— Broiled Sweetbreads, Maitre 
d'Hotcl. 



It can generally be relied upon that 
only two-thirds, perhaps only half the 
people will order such a dish as this how- 
ever good it may be. Prepare the sweet- 
breads by splittmg in slices the fiat way, 
dust with salt and pepper, press down m 
a plate of flour to coat well on both sides; 
broil in the wire oyster broiler. Turn 
frequently and baste with a brush dipped 
m butter. 



653— Red Raspberry Sauce for Pud- 
dings. 



Take half red raspberry juice or syrup 
and half water, lo one cup add half 
cup sugar with a heaping teaspoonful 
starch mixed In it dry. Simmer over the 
fire until thick and clear. Good sauce 
for any white pudding like the preced- 
ing. 



654 — White Mountain Ice Cream. 



I quart cream. 
I pint milk. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 large tablespoons starch. 

Boil the milk and sugar and thicken 
with the starch. Add the cream cold. 
Flavor, strain and freeze.

Take half your roll dough and work in 
sugar and butter, set it to rise again and 
at 4 o'clock make out in round balls or 
cut with a small biscuit cutter; butter 
between them when placing in the pan 
and brush over the tops; place near 
together but not crowded ; rise an hour 
or lone;er and bake in a slack oven about 
20 minutes. 

The difliculty with most people's sweet- 
ened breads is that they are clammy like 
dough not sufficiently baked. There is 
no need of having them that way for all 
that is necessary to make them featherv 
light and dry, is the proper way of knead- 
ing fully explained for coffee cakes at No.

time to rise. 

The right proportions are :

(No. 



659— Beef Soup, a i'Anglais^, or 
English ^tyie. 

It is a brown, strong soup with small 



cut beef and vegetables in it. 

Prepare stock over night that the soup 
may be ready in good time in the fore- 
noon, to allow it to simmer and have fre- 
quent skimming to brighten it. The 
stock may be made by boiling the lower 
portion of round of beef (2 lbs., 15 cents) 
with other beef trimmings and a veal 
bone ; a bayleaf and six cloves and an 
onion. Strain and skim, boil and add a 
thickening of brown roux if you can have 
good butter, or of baked flour, or common 
flour-and-water. Cut 2 small cups of 
different soup vegetables in small dice 
and the same of the cold boiled beef out 
of the stock pot. Simmer at least an 
hour; skim often, season, and at last add 
a tablespoon of walnut catsup, and half 
a lemon cut in small slices. 



660— Whitefish, Point Shirley Style. 

The fish are split in halves, laid open, 
seasoned, baked in a buttered dripping 
pan, egged over while baking and spread 
with softened butter and minced parsley 
when done. Divide in portions with a 
broad fish slice; serve on small plates 
with a spoontul of mashed potato in the 
same "plate. 



661— Bacon and Greens. 

A small quantity of greens, not enough 
to serve as a vegetable with every order, 
fills up a gap in this way and will seldom 
be cailecf upon when other dishes are 
numerous. Boil the bacon with the 
corned beef first, then with the beet, 
radish or turnip greens. Serve a slice on 
each dish of greens. 



662— Veal Patties, Bechamel. 



The term bechamel attached to a dish • 
signifies that it is in cream sauce and con- 
sequentiy white; thus the white oyster 
patties. No. 327, are a la Becliamd in a 
bill of fare. It is the name of a French 
steward or cook, who brought cream 
sauce into notice ; but to be genuine the 
sauce should be but half cream, the other 
half seasoned broth boiled down strong 
and clarified. Cut cooked veal in neal 
dice, put it in bechamel sauce well sea-

soned and fill patty shells wich it same as 
oysters. 



663— String Becns, German Style. 



Snap short and boil an hour. Instead 
of butter or cream sauce to finish cut up 
some bacon or salt pork quite small, and 
boil with the beans after pouring off the 
first water. 



664— Baked Sponge Pudding. 

Make butter sponge cake, No. 561. 
Bake in shallow tins. Sift granulated 
sugar over betore baking and it will come 
out glazed. Cut in small square blocks 
and serve with red syrup made of cherry 
juice, water and sugar. 



665— Cherry Pie, Country Style. 



Roll the paste thin, line the largest pie 
pan. Put in 2 cups of pitted cherries 
raw, spread sugar over, cover with a thin 
crust, bake slowly and well but light 
colored.

66&— Broiled Bass. 

It will be found that dipping the split fish 
in flour before broiling secures a better 



brown color than it will take on without. 
It is a firm fish and rather dry when 
broiled, but preferred so by many to 
whitefish or other oily kinds. Split 
lengthwise, divide each side in two or 
three, flour, and while broiling baste with 
a brush dipped m butter. Small ones 
may be broiled whole, the head being 
left on, and larger ones for restaurant 
orders partly broiled, and finished in the 
oven or wholly broiled by being wrapped 
in buttered paper,allowing plenty of time.

Last evening two of Black's boarders 
came over to look at rooms — ladies — said 
to be a banker's wife and daughter — said 
they could not endure the noise over there 
had heard good reports of our "Eyrie" 
from our two friendly Dukes ; took rooms 
in the hill cottage and would move over 
this morning. They came again for good 
after breakfast. Gentleman soon after 
came over in a buggy ; a colonel some- 
body; has been stopping at the Palmer, 
the other large hotel at the depot. He 
says they gave him a sour mutton chop 
for breakfast this morning; that every 
steak and mutton chop he has had since 
he has been there has been sour "and a 
fellow can't stand that, you know." He 
must have had previous acquaintance 
with these ladies for after engaging a room 
and sending for his baggage they three

went sailing into the west in the same 
bou together before they had been here 
an hour. 

On eleven o'clock train arrived another 
member of the Dukes firm— lady this 
time. Has been at some neighboring 
resort. 

"What is a lady duke called — isn't she 
a duchess?" 

"Why, certainly she is a duchess — of 
course. Goodness ! girls, you must wait 
on them splendidly, the best you know 
how — for now we have a family from 
Paris, two dukes, a duchess, a colonel 
and a banker's wife and daughter — you 
must fold the napkins in beautiful shapes, 
like this and this, and cut the finest bread 
in thick blocks and lay one under the fold 
of the uapkin on each inverted plate, this 
way. The housekeeper will show you 
more when she comes in, but I hope they 
will keep her always busy in th** cottages 
now." 

Arrived at same time two elegant 
boquets for the cook, viz. : one basket of 
summer cabbages, 8 cost 40 cents; and 
one basket summer beets and onions, 
cost the same. 

Have just received notice to prepare a 
little birthday supper two days hence. 



Arrived, first lot of fneat from a new 
butcher, one who is used to supplying 
hotels. Was rather surprised to nna by 
bill everything charged one uniform price, 
II cents a ponnd. 

There is 15-cent ham, 1254-cent loin 
beef and roast, 13-centlard, 8-cent mut- 
ton»and lo-cent lamb and other items all 
charged at 11 cents all round. Seems 
novel, but gooti enough. 

667— Trouble with Sour Meats. 

Noblesse oblige, A gentleman speaks 
truth about a hotel although he may be 
seekmg reasons for leaving it. When 
the colonel says the steaks and chops 
served to him at the Palmer House at 
Uintah Lake are always sour, there is 
nothing to be said but to seek the reason 
why. 

Our breakfast and supper bills of fare 
show that sometimes there will be four 



beefsteaks ordered and at another twelve 
tor fourteen ; the same with lamb or mut- 
ton chops, bacon, fish and other meats ; 
these numbers are to be multiplied by ten 
a for house like the Palmer,at the deppt, 
and yet if a train should arrive bringing 
an unusual number of people to a meal, 
there would be no unusal flurry and the 
many would receive their fresh broiled 
meats as soon as the few would have 
done ; and, taking one time with another, 
there wiU be no more cooked steaks and 
chops left over after a meal for a few than 
for a large number. This is because the 
meats are always kept ready to be laid 
upon the gridiron, but are never actually 
cooked until they are asked for, and this 
is the great recommendation of the first- 
class plan of broiling meats to order over 
the Barnacle way of cooking up a lot of 
meat large enough to meet expected de- 
mands and having to throw away panfuls, 
blackened, dried or sodden of that which 
is left, or be thrown into wild confusion 
by the arrival of five or six unexfjectedly. 
1 he one disadvantage of the possibility 
of the cut meats turning sour before they 
are cooked,is due entirely to carelessness 
There should be a tray made purposely 
to hold the raw steaks, chops and other 
meats, like this : 



Catleta 
Veal and Pork 



Mutton 

and 

Lamb Chops 



II am. 



Tend-jrloiaj 

Co amon 

Steak 



Broiler's Tray of Out Meats. 

This tray is best made of galvanized 
iron: the compartments are 10 or 12 
inches square, the sides are 3 inches 
deep; there are stout handles on two 
sides, like a baking pan, to carry and 
hang up by when not in use. A tray with 
more or smaller compartments than this 
is hard to clean, being unweidly, but 
there might be two used for a large busi- 
ness requiring twice as many kinds of 
meats to be ready. 

The trouble over at the Palmer House 
is caused by the tray being overstocked. 
They not only fill it but stack it up with

steaks, chops and cutlets ; bring it from 
the refrigerator to the kitchen, keep it 
there in front of range and broiler for 
four hours — from 6 till lo in the morn- 
ing — of a hot summer day; only use half 
and cany the remainder back to the 
meat house where it hardly becomes 
cool before supper time when it is brought 
out again. They ^vould not have any 
sour meats if they would but leave the 
bulk of them in the refrigerator and only 
bring out a dozen or two of orders at a 
time— mere matter of forethought.

The colonel when at table, it would 
appear, is talkative and full of life and 
spirits. That's all right. He made the 
aemark that my consomme was exquisite 
but, was seasoned too highly with cay- 
enne, and of course I heard; of it. No 
such thing. But that's all right. Ill 
bet he only said it to lead off to curries 
and his experiences in hot climates and 
his **hairDreath 'scapes by flood and 



field." That's all right too; we all have 
our parts tojplay and get our work in when 
we can. Then, later on, he asked the 
manager, with whom he is already on 
terms of the utmost cordiality, why this was 
called Eve's pudding and the manager, 
laughing, said he would ask me. Now, a 
fellow does not want to be bothered with 
fool questions after scudding around the 
whole of a hot morning preparing a din- 
ner and then carving and serving it ; still 
I did not tell them to go to thunder as 
cooks generally do under such circum- 
stances — this house being too small for 
anybody to be mean in— but replied that 
the pudding is as old as the hills ; one of 
the oest ever was invented; the receipt 
has been put in rhyme like Sydney Smith's 
salad dressing; didn't known why it^ is 
called Eve's unless because it contains 
apples, and couldn't even see where that 
came in. Then the irrepressible colonel 
took a bill of fare and wrote on the back 
of it: 

Eureka 1 

"The woman tempted me and I did 
eat." 

The pudding tempted /«tf and /did eat I 

The manager showed it to me after 
dinner was over. That's all right. Ill 
keep it to fling at the next one asks me 
something I don't know. I'll have to 
save tenderloin steaks for the colonel. 



668— Consomme a la do Stael. 

It is a clear, rich brown soup with 
lozenge shapes of fried bread and 
quenelle forcemeat in the plates. 

Make a rich broth of beef and veal 
boUed down strong overnight with a 
bunch of soup vegetables and three or 
four cloves. Strain into a jar. When 
cold remove the fat, pour off from the 
sediment. Chop a pound of lean beef 
and boil up in the beef broth. Strain 
through a napkin. Set over the fire again 
sdm, season, and add from one-third to 
one-half of a little white pot of Leibeg's 
extract of Ineat (private stock from the 
cook's valise.) The consomme will then 
have sufficient color and flavor. 

For the quenelles mince a piece of 
white veal size of an egg, (or; use breast 
of partridge, quail or chicken if at hand) 
and then pound to a paste. Season with» 
a pinch of minced herbs or parsley and 



^9 



COOKING FOR PROMT. 



grated lemon rind (very little), moisten 
with yolk of egg, fatten out, cut with 
something like a funnel point or apple 
corer if you have not the proper cutters, 
drop the quenelles in boilmg water ; dip 
up two to each plate of soup. Cut out 
bread with the same cutter, fry in the 
clear part of melted butter and put two 
in each plate with the quenelles. 

These little accessories can be made 
ready long before they are to be used ; 
perhaos in the intervals between orders 
while Dreakfast is going on. The French 
name was given lonG; ago in allusion to 
Madame de Stael, of literary and political 
fame. 



669— The Chevalier Style. 



One of our French authors writes ad- 
miringly of "the chevaliers and abbes" 
of the last century, and their beneficent 
influence in advancing and disseminating 
the art of cookery. The chevaliers, it 
appears, were men of high social position ; 
a sort of gentlemen soldiers, educated 
according to the culture of those days; 
having nothing particular to do but travel 
and see what they thought was the world; 
putting up themselves and their steeds at 
the monasteries when it happened that 
there was no inn that offered entertain- 
ment for man and beast ; observing what 
the fattest of the fat friars ate and thrived 
upon and telling it at the next table for 
the edification of the new company; 
samplinc and remembering the best dishes 
of the different countries and carrying the 
news in the times when books, papers and 
readers alike were few and duU. It could 
not be otherwise than that some maitres 
^ hotel (stewards of wealthy houses) 
should eagerly name some dish which 
had been so lucky as to be approved by 
one of these perhaps temporarily C9n- 
spicuous personages, a la chhjoliere, which 
is impliedlv a la mode chevalUre; or — as 
we shoula write it — in the chevalier 
fashion ; and it appears that there have 
been many dishes so named, but nearly 
all were evanescent, having no distin- 
gubhment but some trifling accessory or 
whim of decoration of no permanent 
value. A comparison of several author- 
ities shows that the only dishes which all 
agree in designating as a la chevaliere, 
are those that are egged and bre?d- 



crumbed. A chicken breaded and fried 
is a la chevaliere, a trout breaded and 
fried is a la chevaliere, too. The deco- 
rations vary,the breading is the one perma^ 
nent feature. There is a refinement in 
this however, which requires grated cheese 
— Parmesan— to be mixed with the bre d 
curmbs used to coat the morsel. It may 
easily be imagined how some epicurean 
rover sitting down to breakfast with the 
sleek abbot found a surprise and a revel- 
ation in his first dish of capon bread- 
crumbed and fried in oil ; how he labored 
to reproduce the dish when he returned 
come, and how it came to be called the 
chevalier's. 

It should be observed that although 
the masculine chevalier does not termi- 
nate with Cy a i>eculiarity of the French 
language requires a terminal ^ to be 
added and makes it feminhie in the 
menu, as are all the words which follow 
"a la mode.'* Parisian style potatoes as- 
sume the feminine Parisienne; macaroni 
Italian style becomes Italienne, and so 
with all designations after "a la" except 
the proper names of persons. 



670— Ti out, a la Chevaliere. 

Split the fish, remove all bones, sea- 
son with fine salt, cayenne and drops of 
lemon juice. Mbc together 2 cups cracker 
meal and i cup grated or finely minced 
cheese (any kind.) Dip the sides of the 
fish in beaten egg in a shallow pan, then 
in the cracker dust mixture ana let lie in 
it awhile. Spread a baking pan with soft 
butter, lay the fish in and bake slowly, 
basting once with melted butter. The 
pan should be roomy that the pieces of 
fish may not be crowded together. Serve 
hot and crisp without sauce, but with 
potatoes in the same plate. 



671— Nantaise Potatoes. 



Scoop out fluted berry shapes of raw 
potatoes with a potato spoon, put them 
in a saucepan with a lump of butter and 
let simmer in it until done, then pour ofl^ 
the butter, set the potatoes in the oven 
to brown slightly. Sprmkle with minced 
parsley. Serve with fish. Nantaise has 
reference to the city of Nantes, in France.

672~Lamb Cutlets with Puree 
Green Peas. 



Take ths best shaped lamb chops, trim 
nicely and flatten, season, dip in fl9ur and 
have them ready in a frying pan with very 
little fat from the roastmg meats. 

Mash some very green cooked peas 
through a seive, season with butter and 
white pepper, drop a pear shaped spoon- 
ful of this green puree in each individual 
dish, shape and smooth it a little, Iry 
(saute) the lamb chops, lay one on top of 
the puree, press down shghtly, pour a 
spoonful of light brown sauce around the 
base in the dish. 



673— Scrambled Sweetbreads in 
Pastry Borders. 

Small and fragmentary sweetbreads 
that cannot be sliced can be used this 
way. Cut them in dice, put in a frying 
pan with butter and eggs, salt, pepper, 
scramble same as eggjs, not too dry, add 
a squeeze of lemon juice and little minced 
parsley. 

Roll out scraps of pie paste, cut out 
crescent shapes with a scolloped cake 
cutter and bake them. Serve the sweet- 
breads in flat dishes with pastry crescents 
at each end. 



y2 pound bread crumbs minced fine — 
about 4 cups. 

}i pound chopped suet— i cup. 

6 ounces raisins or currants— i cup. 

Same of chopped apples. 

Nutmeg— about J^ grated. 

Mbc the above together dry, then beat 
up in another bowl : 

4 ^ggs- 

6 tablespoons milk or water. 

3 tablespoons sugar. 

Minced lemon peel, or a little extract 
if at hand. 

Stir all well together; tie up in a pud- 
ding cloth and boil 4 hours. Serve with 
hard sauce or any other plum pudding 
sauce. 



674 — Dried Lima Beans. 



The dried are better than the canned. 
They are not hard to cook either. Soak a 
cupful in water a few hours and boil about 
an hour. Drain off and season in the same 
way as peas, that is, sometimes with cream 
sauce, sometimes with butter only or, 
with small pieces of bacon or salt pork 
stewed in them. Should they prove to 
be of a sample difficult to boil soft add a 
small piece of baking soda to the water 
they are boiled in. 



676— Raspberry Butter Sauce. 



Make hard sauce in the uiual manner 
(No. 177 ;) and stir in enough of the f yrup 
from [ carlet raspberries to color and and 
flavor it. 



677— White Cocoanut Custard. 



675— Eve's Pudding. 

It is a good sort of boiled plum pud- 
ding, not so rich and heavy; is cinnamon 
colored when made right. It is well worth 
while to weigh the ingredients as they are 
uncertain things to measure. 



There is a most excellent white cocoa- 
nut mixture at No. 163; but takei up 
more time than this to make. 

For this proceed as if making custard 
pie, using all whites and counting 2 
whites equal to one egg; which will be: 

3 cups milk. 

I cup white of eggs — 10 or 12 whites. 

% cup sugar. 

I heaping cup cocoanut. 

I teaspoon lemon extract. 

Beat up, fill 2 paste-lined pie pans and 
bake slovvly. 

Meringue (or fiost) them over when they 
are nearly done ; stirring in a little rasp- 
berry syrup to color the frosting pink and 
dredge granulated sugar on the surface 
before baking. 



678— Trouble with the Ice Cream. 



A little party of four ladies from the 
Trulirural House came over in a boat im- 
mediately after dinner. Wanted to know 
of the manager whether really and truly, 
you know, we have ice cieam every day. 
Said they never were so disappointed, 
the Trulirural only makes ice cream once 
a week, that is on Sunday, and after all 



II 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



when it was made it proved to be only 
frozen buttermilk full of lumps of butter. 
These four are the elders remaining of 
the party that came over serenading 
about ten days ago. They have taken 
rooms and will move over before supper. 
I know how that ice cream trouble oc- 
curred ; saw the same mishap at Bass- 
wood City. There vras a young fellow of 
a tGO sanguine di-iposition struggling 
aUng witli a restaurant that did not pay, 
buoyed up by ihe visions of wealth he 
was going to realize during the approach- 
ing summer by making ice cream. Be- 
ing consulted, I advised the purchase of 
only one freezer, or, if he must have two, 
to get a 4-quart and a 6-quart size. 
Young man thought I was surely jesting 
and sent off for a 4-gallon and a lo-gal- 
lon. On the first balmy day that fore- 
tokened the arrival of gentle spring he in- 
vited all his acquaintances to a treat of the 
first luscious ice cream of the season; his 
own make ; the first he had ever made,and 
afcer all it proved a delusion and for him 
a mortification that he never recovered 
from. It was buttermilk and butter 
frozen, buch a thing could not happen 
to a person who might not care whether 
the ice cream were not good or mdiflfer- 
ent, but this party was too solicitous, 
whipped or churned the cream to make 
It foamy, and increase the bulk when the 
temperature was just right for "butter to 
come" quickly. If the young man had 
had freezers to buy that afternoon he 
would have been content with a i-quart 
and a 2-quart, for he took a sudden dis- 
gust at the ice cream business. Pour 
your cream into the freezer, sweeten and 
flavor it and freeze without further prep- 
aration, but after it is frozen then the 
more it is beaten the better it will be and 
"butter won't come" at that temperatiire. 

Supper.

Cocoanut cookies (without eggs, and 

other cake, 15 cents.)

Total, $2 68; 34 j)ersons; 8 cents a

679— Waffles— Yeast Raised. 



6 cups fiour — i^^ oounds. 

2 large cups milk or water. 

2-cent cake compressed yeast. 

^ cup melted butter or lard. 

4 or 5 eggs, or yolks left over. 

Salt. 

Dissolve the yeast in the milk (or water) 
lukewarm ; stir up all to a thick batter 
and beat it well with a large egg whip or 
spoon. Let rise in a moderately warm 
place about 4 hours, beat up again half 
an hour before baking time. If^you use 
potato yeast a cupful will be required. 
If mixed at 2 o'clock in summer the bat- 
ter will be ready to bake at 6. 

Anyone who has made muffins out of 
the roll dough as at No. 582; can take the 
same advantage making waffle batter, 
using about 4 cups of roll dough, warm 
milk to thin it down like batter cakes and 
the enriching ingreaients the same as in 
this receipt. It will be ready to bake in 
an hour after, if warm. 

Any kind of batter cake mixture can 
be baked in waffle irons if they are in 
good order and not burnt, and waffles 
can be made without eggs if the same as 
batter cakes, but when they stick to the 
irons the remedy is to add an egg or two, 
and waffles without eggs cannot be baked 
in much haste but must have time and 
dry out of the irons. Syrup or sugar in 
the batter causes them to bake brown. 
It is a vast improvement and prevents 
sticking to beat the batter very thor- 
oughly. 

Make the waffle irons hot, put in a tea- 
spoonful of melted lard and turn over, 
pour batter in each compartment, shut 
up and bake both sides. Waffles are 
known only by the name of wafers in 
some places. 

680 — Cocoanut Cookies without bggs.

rants. Cut the raisins in halves, dust

the cake the usual way by stirring butter, 
sugar and milk together first. Frost over

682— Saratoga C»?ip Potatoes. 

Shave raw potatoes into the thinnest 
possible slices, drop a a few at a time 
mto a saucepan of hot lard and let fry to 
a deep yellow color. Drain them well, 
keep hot in a colander set in a pan, 
sprinkle with fine salt. They curf up 
like shavings if sliced thin enough. Not 
really necessary to dry each slice on a 



Busy day in the kitchen and dinner 
must stand back and make itself small. 
Fruit is very abundant and cheap and the 
hostess and that one of her hired girls 
that has the biggest arms are twisting and 
squeezing currants and raspberries in 
strong t9wels expressing the juice to boil 
down with equal weight of sugar to make 
jellv. It is a pressing business which 
makes the girl red in the face, as pressing 
might be expected to do, and the land- 
lady herself has her lips c^'iriously set as 
she says she is "afraid somebody will be 
very much annoyed by their putting up 
fruit in the kitcken, but — ." 

I don't know what the final but, was in- 
tended to mean, unless it was : 
"But when she will she will, ym may 

depend on't. 
And when she won't she won't, and 

there's an end on't." 
However, the landlady is very kindly 
disposed and interested, as this is Mr. 
Farewell's birthday, and a little supper is 
in preparation to celebrate the anniver- 
sary. The cakes are auready ornamented 
with initials and dates on them as large 
as life and wreathed with roses, but care- 
fully hidden away to guard against spring- 
ing the surprise too soon. The chickens 
are already boiling for salad, Lnd the 
manager went to the depot this time un- 
der heavy injunctions not to forget the 
lemons. Mrs. Farewell also, made 
a special request of me that the frosting 
on the cakes be of such a nature that it 
can be sliced evenly with the cake itself, 
whether the slices be thick or thin ; not 
break off" in the annoying way of their 
town confectioner's cakes as soon as the 
cake is cut. Requests like these are im- 
perial orders and must be obeyed, and — 
"Our praises are our wages." — (Shakes- 
peare.) 

But, Maryl It is time now to set your 
preserving kettle away off" the stove until 
after dinner; it would break my heart to 
see you all starving to death at one 
o'clock precisely.

If you put your fish to bake in plain 
milk or cream at fiibt, exj:^cting to thicken 
the sauce when the fish is done, you find 
that it has been curdled by the gelatine 
from the fish and has an unsightly ap- 
pearance. Make the cream sauce first, 
of rich milk, a little minced onion, butter 
and flour, pour it boiling hot over the fish 
in a baking pan; bake about '2>^ hour 
basting twice ; at last add a little cream 
and chopped parsley. Serve in small 
plates with Parisienne potatoes plain 
steamed in the same.

683~Scotch Barley Broth. 



Fake the trimmings of the lamb, tne 
shank, shoulder bone and neck of mut- 
ton, and add spare pieces of other meats; 
boil them in eight quarts of water from 
early morning until 10 or 1 1 o'clock. Boil 
6 tablespoonfuls of barley for 6 quarts of 
soup in a separate saucepan. 

Strain off the broth, skim well, put in 2 
cupfuls of turnip, carrott and onion cut 
in small dice, some chopped parsley, salt 
and pepper, the barley already cooked 
and rinsed off in hot water; boU till the 
vegetables are done, thicken very slightly 
and add a cupful of lean meat from the 
neck of mutton, also cut in dice. 



The beef having been well corned,^ the 
next requisite to make it a good dish is to 
give it plenty of time to boil tender. The 
cabbage should be boiled separately and 
chopped and seasoned at last with the fat 
from the beef boiler. If cooked together 
the beef left to slice cold is too strongly 
flavored. Serve the cabbage in a flat 
dish with a slice of beef on top. 



686— Stuffed Shoulder of IV!utton. 



Take out the bone, lay a thin covering 
of well-seasoned bread «^tuffing upon the 
meat; roll up, tie with twine and cook 
the same as rolled brisket of veal ; No.

637— Beets in Butter Sauce. 



684 — Trout a la Bechamel. 



Another name for it is trout baked in 
cream. As previously stated at No. 662, 
any dish of fish or meat that is in cream 
sauce is allowably designated a la Becha- 



Beets should not be cut before cooking 
as they lose their juice and color. Boil 
about an hour, rub off the skin in cold 
water, cut up into a saucepan, add 2 cups 
water, Vz cup vinegar, half as much but- 
ter, salt, and flour thickening to niake a 
moderately thick sauce when it boils. 



688— Onions in Cream Sauce. 

Boil in plenty of water and pour the 
water away entirely, as it is dark colored. 
Make sufficient cream sauce well salted 
in another saucepan and put the onions 
in.

side dish for next day's dinner. After 
roasting in a small pan about half an 
hour set them away to get cold, and at 
night sliced thinly enough for 16 individ- 
ual dishes to be set at intervals along the 
table, ornamented ^vith colored jelly, and 
the remainder kept in reserve in case of 
further orders.

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



692— Calf's Foot o*- Aspic or Savory 
Jelly. 

Colored jelly in ornamental shapes was 
the distinguishing characteristic of Car- 
erne's system in cookery, particularly as 
he employed it to produce gorgeous effects 
of light and color in the elaborately dec- 
orated set tables and grand banquets of 
his time ; classic figures in wax, ^ waxen 
leaves and borders and scenic designs are 
.the distinguishing characteristic of the 
later system origmated (or,^ rather re- 
suscitated, for there is nothing new) by 
the court cooks at Vienna, and fosterea 
and encouraged by the emperor and em- 

Eresj themselves, as if they would fain 
ave an original system for their own 
court and following, not borrowed from 
the French. 

The extent of the impression made by 
Careme upon the English cooks and con- 
fectioners, then, might almost be meas- 
ured by the frequency of the dishes in 
aspic and the offers of brilliant sweet 
jellies among the confections for sale in 
the shops; tne prevalence of the German 
methocfe by the frequency of the waxen 
Neptunes, dolphins, forests and flowers 
worked on the stands which hold up the 
dishes at any elaborate exhibition of 
culinary skill. The essential part of the 
cookery, that which affects the eatable 
part of the dishes cannot in the nature of 
thmgs differ much, it is only a divergence 
of externals and it has to be said of the 
dishes in jelly that they are at least all 
eatable, the savory ornaments even more 
so perhaps than the meat itself. 

if there could be an American dis- 
tinctive style it would be marked by the 
use of fruit jellies, cranberry sauce and 
jelly with game, apples, pears and peaches 
m compotes and pickles sweet as well as 
sour, such things as Careme had an 
inklingof when he built up his *'supremes 
of truits" — pyramidal forms of fruits pre- 
served whole and decorated with straw- 
ernes and green angelica. 
But the simple style of individual ser- 
vice now so universally employed while 
it brings into use a great number of small 
dishes, gbsses and silver-ware almost 
precludes the use of any method of oma- 
meniation beyond such borders and 
sprinklings as may be formed in the act 
of dishing the food. 



693— ro Make Calfs Foot Jelly. 

For reasons named in the preceding 
article if in England or France we write 
jelly it is understood first to mean gela- 
tine jelly, whether savory like the jelly o 
head-cheese or sweet aiid wine flavored, 
but in the United States it is taken to 
mean jellied fruits. So if we find our- 
selves at some country resort where the 
landlady and all her maidservants are 
busy making currant^ gooseberry, rasp- 
berry and apple jelhes to put away for 
winter use and we have to make at the 
same time ornamental clear jelly of Car- 
eme's own sort with which to decorate a 
birthday supper table, we must call it 
calfs foot jelly, lest there be an impres- 
sion that we have been surreptitiously 
dipping into the wrong kettles. 



I To make the jelly really of calves feet 
' as it used to be forty or fifty years ago, 
you first put on 2 feet in 4 quarts of 
water, simmer for 6 or 8 hours, and the 
feet will be so nearly dissolved that the 
liquor that remains — which will measure 
about 2 quarts when strained off— will 
set in strong jellv when cold. It has 
then to be freed from fat, sweetened, 
spiced and clarified in all respects the 
same as the gelatine jelly of Nos. 465 and 
466; that is if to be a lemon or other sweet 
jelly, but if to be savory jelly it will be 
seasoned something like a savory dish of 
meat« 

694 — How to Serve Colored Jellies-- 
Five Ways, 

1. Pour the jelly (No. 465 ;) when made 
into soup plates or bright pans quite 
shallow. Set on ice. Cut it in diamond 
shapes when set, and put one piece of 
each color in small stem glasses, get 
three glass cake stands, set one on tl e 
other, they being of three sizes ; set the 
glasses of jelly upon them for a pyramid 
of jelly for the center of the table. 

2. Cut thejelly in diamonds or squares 
and serve in ice cream saucers individu- 
ally with cake. 

3. Pour the jelly into small custard 
cups, or individual ornamental jelly 
moulds or other small form, run a pen- 
knife around to loosen and shake out 
the form of jelly on to the individual ice- 
cream plate. 



SAN J^RANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



76 



4. Cool the jelly in the ordinary stamped 
jelly moulds, dip in warm water when 
wanted, turn out the shape and place 
on large dishes along the table, to 
be served with a spoon or the people to 
help each other. 

5. Cool the jelly in the large orna- 
mental border moulds which have a 
hollow middle. When perfectly cold 
turnout the border of jelly — first dipping 
the mould a moment in warm water — on 
to a cake stand and fill the center cavity 
with whipped cream. 



695— To Make Savory or Aspic Jelly. 

Aspic is the French cooks' name for 
it. It is the jelly formed by boiling meat 
down till the liquor will set when cold, the 
ielly, for example of head cheese, or of 
boiled cfhickens when the liquor has nearly 
all boiled away,and if it is the intention to 
make jelly of such liquor an extra calf s 
foot or pi^'s foot or two will be thrown in 
at the beginning of the boUing and make 
the liquor stronger. This being the jelly 
in the rough state — seasoned as soup 
would be to make it taste ^ood and relish- 
— in order to change its appearance 
from dull gray into an article ot sparkling 
transparency it is necessary to clarify it 
by boiling white of eggs and lemon juice 
in it and straining it through a flannel 
jelly bag. 

1 he making ot savory jelly is not an 
abstruse and foreign affau:, but anyone 
who takes pleasure m such things finding 
at hand some meat liquor that has set in 
jelly finn enough to cut with a knife can 
clarify it and use it to set off a luncheon 
or supper table in a way that is by no 
means common. 

But when there is no meat jelly already 
formed make some by dissolving an ounce 
oi sheet gelatine in a auart of good soup 
stock, season it niceiy, let it get quite 
cold to remove the grease, then melt and 
clarify it as for sweet jelly at No. 465. 

Make different tints by adding burnt 
sugar dissolved in boiling water for amber 
and brown, and cochineal or beet juice 
for pink and red. 

Extra fine jelly, more brilliant than is 
ever seen in the restaurant windows, is 
made by putting it through the clarifying 
process twice, allowmg a little in the 



measure for the inevitable loss of quan- 
tity m the repeated boiling and filtering ; 
and a correspondingly enhanced flavor is 
obtained by adding a proportion of 
sherry. 

698— Ornamenting with Aspic Jelly 

1. Place thui slices of breast of chicken 
or turkey in individual platters. Chop 
some jelly quite small, put it in a paper 
cornet, snip off the end and squeeze the 
jelly through in a cord around the edge 
of the dish or in patterns the same as the 
ornamental frosting of a cake. 

2. Chop some of the brightest jelly 
not very small, and sprinkle about a 
teaspoonful over the sliced meat or 
around upon a salad. • 

3. Cool the jelly in plates quite shal- 
low and when set cut, it in triangular 
shapes, large or small in pioportion to 
the size of dishes to be ornamented, and 
set the pieces in order around the edge 
ot the dish. 

4. Pour the jelly upon the thin sliced 
meat in large platier, just enough to 
cover, set it on ice and when it has be- 
come firm cut out the slices with the 
coating of jelly upon them and ornament 
the edges with minced jelly and parsley. 

5. Take a solid boneless piece of 
cooked and pressed meat like head 
cheese, pressed corned beef or tongue, 
boned turkey or chicken or liver pate and 
put it in a mould or pan that is a little 
too large for it, fill up the mould with 
melted jelly — there should be a quarer 
inch or more space for the jelly on all 
sides and underneath — make it quite 
cold, turn out by first dipping the mould 
a moment in warm water and then slice 
the meat with border of jelly adhering to 
each slice. 



697— To Clarify Jelly withe ut Eggs. 

Use lean beef chopped fine, about 4 
ounces to a quart. This is the way ^ fine 
consommes are made clear, and it is 
as good for jelly. Mix the minced beef 
thoroughly with a little cold water, stir it 
into the jelly after it has been boiled 
once, (without any white of eggs) then 
boil again and strain through the jelly 
bag. It b the albumeii in beef that has 
the effect in clearing the fluid it is boiled

in. I 

"But won't it make it taste?" somebody : 
says, as the mineed beef goes into the I 
sweet jelly. 

"No ; only like calf s foot ielly ;'* indeed 
it is- an improvement, for all gelatine has 
a slightly unpleasant flavor which the 
fresh beef removes. Of course if white 
of eggs can be had as well as not there is 
no need to resort to the substitute, yet, 
it is often very convenient to know how 
to do without. 

698— Tongue Sandwiches. 

Make dough as for French rolls, after 
the last kneading roll it out extremely 
thin, brush the sheet all over with melted 
butter and double it upon itself; roll it 
again and when it has stood a minute or 
two to lose the tendency to draw out of 
shape cut out with a biscuit cuttei, place 
in pans, brush over with butter, rise 
nearly an hour and bake. These are flat 
round rolls that will pull apart when 
done. Spread one halt with butter the 
other with potted tongue and put them 
together. Or, use potted tongue with 
plain sliced bread. 



699— Potted Tongue. 

Boil a corned tongue 3 hours, if a beef 
tongue, or until tender. Dip it in cold 
water and peel off" the skin. Cut up and 
mince small, then pound it to a paste. 
Melt two large cupfuls of butter and pre- 
pare a teaspoonful of mixed ground 
spices, half mace and the rest cloves, 
nutmeg and cayenne. Add the spices to 
the tongue, and a little salt besides, and 
most of the clear part of the melted bui- 
ter, and pound it all together. Press it 
into cups or small jars tightly to exclude 
the air and pour the rest of the clear but- 
ter on top. Keep covered in a cool place. 



700— Lobster Salad without May- 
onaise. 

Cut white heart lettuce in shreds and 
across quite fine ; break about the same 
amount of lobster in small pieces but 
without mashing it, season both with 
celery, celery-salt, salt, cayenne, oil and 
vinegar enough to moisten, mix together, 
serve on individual dishes ornamented 



with cooked beets stamped out in shapes. 
Can be made likewise with finely minced 
cabbage with some thick cream, salt and 
pepper stirred in and the lobster on top* 

701— Panachee, or Tri«colored eel- 
Cream. 



The same as Neapolitan, No. 227; 
which see for directions and use of 
molds. The bill-of-fare writers get tired of 
and having the same thing over and over 
instead of repeating Neapolitan they call 
itpanachee, it being like panachee jelly, 
which is of three colors in layers, and 
named after the tn-colored feather which 
used to be worn in the hat as the sign or 
badge of the French republican. 

1 o save trouble on the occasion of this 
party supper, the 2 quarts of white ice 
cream frozen with the dinner cream in 
the morning was divided, and half of it 
colored with caramel and cinnamon and 
frozen again in a imall pail set in a wash- 
tub of small ice and salt. The red was 
cherry juice taken from the preserving 
kettles and mixed with water, then frozen 
the same wav and all three kinds put in 
brick moulas and packed down for 3 
hours. Cost 67 cents for 3 quarts. 

702— Florentine Meringue. 

Roll out a sheet of puff paste thin and 
cover a baking pan bottom with it, spread 
jelly or preserves upon it and pake. 
VVhip up some mermgue and mix in 
chopped almonds or desiccated cocoanut 
and spread that on top of the florentine, 
sift sugar on top and bake. It is like the 
fruit meringues in a general way but 
ought to be thm, to cut in large, but flat 
strips. The meringue can be made with 
gelatine instead of white of eggs if sa 
needed. 



703— Neapolitan Cake. 



The new fashion for it is to make layer 
cakes of three colors, white, yellow, (or 
pink) and chocolate,^ spread jelly and 
build up to 6 layers high ; trim tr.e edges 
and ice it all over. Three kinds can be 
made without eggs, by using Nos. 655 and 
632 ; and making part of the latter pink 
with raspberry juice. The old fashion 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



78 



was to make pound jelly cake 6 or 8 
layers high ana ice it and ornament. 

704— Ornamented Fruit Cake. 



Cut a pound of citron yi strips and add 
to the mixture No. 68i. Bake in a large 
round mold previously lined with but- 
tered paper. Put on two coats of icing, 
a border around^ and if for a birthday 
party put up the mitials of the person's 
name m letters of lace-work icing 6 or 8 
inches high according to plan to be found 
described in succeeding pages. 

705~Cake Frosting That Will Not 
Break Off. 



Our birthday cake was required to be 
cut in pieces and sent hither and thither, 
a piece or two to Basswood City and some 
more to Lakeport, and it would have 
been extremely annoying had the frosting 
all broke away on the first attempt to cut 
it, and yet that is just what the common 
raw icing will always do if made with 
white of eggs alone. But if you dissolve 
a little gelatine in hot water in a cup, 
have it like thicic mucilage, then use it 
and one or two whites of eggs mixed in 
to beat up the sugar with; the frosting 
will stay on the cake and cut as easy as 
a piece of cheese. For a rule, take : 

2 tablespoons dissolved gelatine. 

2 whites of eggs. 

2 cups sugar. 

Put all in a bowl and stir with a wooden 
paddle. To making icing or frosting 
easily it is best to have it as thick as 
dough at first, it soon turns thin as the 
sugar dissolves, when it becomes too 
thick with long stirring it can be reduced 
with warm water by the teaspoon ful, or 
with white of egg. 

A few drops of acetic acid, or lemon 
juice, or cream tartar added to icing 
whitens and stiffins it. Add lemon or 
vanilla extract to flavor. 



706— Boiled Icing, That Will 
Break.

Set the water and sugar on to boil,have 
it just like making candy. Whisk the 
whites to a stiff froth, pour the boiling 
sugar into the whites, stir up and spread 
on the cake immediately. If boiled 
enough it will set firm as soon as cold, 
if not set it in a warm place to dry. 



707— Chocolate Boiled 
Eggs.

5^ teacup water. 

4 ounces common chocolate, grated —

Boil all together almost to candy point,

708— CI;ocolate Icing Not BoiipH 



1 pound sugar — 2 cups— either granu- 
latea or powdered will do. 

6 whites of eggs. 

4 ounces grated common chocolate — 
I cup. 

2 teaspoons vanilla extract. 

Put the sugar and whites of eggs to- 
gether into a bowl and beat rapidly with 
a wooden spoon or paddle, in a cool place 
for about ten minutes, or until you have 
good white frosting. Set the grated 
chocolate on the side of the stove to melt 
merely hy the heat, without anything 
added to it. Pour it to the frosting in 
the bowl, add flavor, beat up and use to 
cover cakes or spread between layers. 

Speaking of cake glaze and^ icings, 
however, there are two young friends of 
mine, the head and second baker at the 
Gondolier-Grand Hotel, at Firefly Grove, 
who have their ambition aroused even 
now while I am writing this, trying how 
many and how choice a lot of small cakes 
and trifles they can send in, in the silver 
baskets daily, and are much pleased with 
the soft glazes or icings of tne foUowin^^ 
receipts, which they found in the Ameri- 
can Pastry Cook. They find a number 
of uses for them and are glad of having 
so many kinds and colors. Another 
friend, a grizzly bearded old partner up 
north was using them one day, and he 
remarked: "Hal that's what we call 
bongdongt eh?— you know?'*

5 quarts clear soup stock. 

Yi lb, chopped lean beef. 

2 whites of eggs to clear it, 

I cup green cooked peas. 

I cup carrot and turnip and leek and 
celery if you have them cut in. smallest 
dice. 

r teaspoon extract of meat. 

Draw off the stock free from grease, 
put in the beef and white of egg mixed 
with some cold water and set ic on to 
boil. When well boiled strain through a 
napkin or tammy cloth or jelly bag. Cook 
the vegetables separately, wash them off", 
season the consomme with salt and cay- 
enne and add meat extract (or glaze of 
your own making) to color light brown, 
and then the vegetables. 



7R-Fillets of Trout Spanish Style. 



Cook the fish this way when you have 
a lot of small ones, such as brook trout, 
or lake hemng. Run a knife along both 
sides of the back bone and take it out. 
Take the two sides, double them, the 
meat side outwards, lay them in a but- 
tered baking pan one leaning upon the 
other so as to hold it in shape, and so 
proceed until the pan has all it will con- 
tain, one layer deep^ the boned part of 
the fillets of fish being on top. Before 
putting in the fish strew some finely 
minced onion in the pan. After the fish 
is in, sprinkle salt and pepper, sitt over a 
little cracker meal, and pour in enough 
light colored veal gravy mixed with 
strained tomato, or Spanish stock sauce 
(No. 78a;> to half cover the fillets, and 
bake light brown. Dish out of the pan 
it is baked in, one fillet to each person, a 
spoonful of the sauce and a few potatoes 
of any baked or fried kind like the follow- 
ing in the same plate. 



715— Potataes, a la Brabant. 



Cut raw potatoes in dice, medium size 
and perfect cubes, rejecting the uneven 
sides and ends. Boil them in water 



drain off before they break, then fry in 
clean lard very light colored. Sprinkle 
with salt and finely minced parsley, 
Brabant is the name of a place — a duchy. 

716— Epigramme of Lamb, a la Tri- 
anon. 



Epigramme is the French cooks' name 
for the brisket or breast of lamb. After 
cutting lamb chops for breakfast there 
will be three or four of these briskets on 
hand. Saw them lengthwise in two, boil 
for half an hour in soup stock well sea- 
soned, press them between two dishes. 
When cold bread them by dipping in egg 
and cracker meal, lay in a pan, pour a 
little oil, clear butter or drippings oyer 
and bake light brown. To serve : divide 
in pieces about 4 or 5 ribs wide, place a 
spoonful of sauce in the dish and the meat 
pressed down in it. It does not do well 
to fry it after breading, the bright yel- 
low-orown of a careful bake is what 
makes it a desirable entree. 



7 r7— Sauce Trianon. 

It IS a yellow sauce made of \yhite 
butter sauce with yolks of eggs stirred 
in to color, and speckled with minced 
trufiies, mushrooms, shalots and white 
pepper. Add a spoonful of white wine 
or little dash of lemon juice. A very 
small quantity of such a sauce can be 
made to fill the bill and one small truf- 
fle out of a bottle and four or five 
mushrooms sliced will be all that are 
needed. Trianon is the name of a place 
— a French palace. 



718— Potato Salad. 



Take cold boiled potatoes, slice them 
thinly so that the vinegar will penetrate. 
For a bowl of sliced potatoes mince^ 
one good sized onion and a bunch of 
parsley and throw on top, also salt and 
white pepper. Pour over half cup pf 
olive oil and mix all well. If you mix 
all with oil this way first the parsley re- 
tains its green color, which vinegar 
used first takes away. Pour oyer half 
cup of vinegar and mix by turning from' 
one bowl to another shortly before serv-

fully.

W'Tien rolls are made in the morning 
instead of making loaves of bread of the 
dough that remains keep it cold until the 
middle of the forenoon. Then roll it 
out on the table to a thin sheet — as thin 
as the edge of a dinner plate. Cut it all 
in squares,about 2V2 inches,place a table- 
spoonful of fruit in the middle of each 
and lap the comers over the top. Pinch 
the edges together a little, set the dump- 
lings in a greased pan and also brush over 
the tops with a little melted lard or but- 
ter. Let rise about 45 minutes, like rolls. 
Have a large pan of boiling water — a 
baking pan will do, drop the dumplings 
in and cook 20 minutes either on top of 
the stove or. in the oven. Serve with 
sauce, either No. 70; or, hard sauce or 
cream.

720— Green Corn Soup. 

Any good simple soup not specially 
flavored may have grated com and some 
milk added to it and will be generally 
acceptable. For a rule for 30 to 35 per- 
sons take: 

5 quarts soup stock. 

I or 2 quarts milk. 

I can of com or a quart of green coin 
grated. 

I tablespoon minced onion. 

5^ lb, salt pork. 

Boil a carrot, tumipand onion with the 
meat, bones and water that makes the 
stock. Cut the pork in dice and fry it light 
brown, and then pour away the fat, boil 
up the milk in the pork pan to obtain the 
flavor of the frying, and pour all back 
into the stock pot. Strain into a clean 
saucepan, add the minced onion, the 
corn mashed or grated, boil up and sea- 
son, and sprinkle a little parsley finely 
minced. 



721— Boiled Muskallonge. 



The muskallonge is fish like the pick- 
erel. It is convenient sometimes to nave 
another name even for the same fish for 
the pur{X)ses of a bill of fare. Mark off 
the fish in individual portions. Have the 
water ready boiling, put in a bay leaf, an 
onion and 4 cloves and salt and piece of 
lemon if at hand, drop in the fish, boil 
gently at the side of the range not over 
half an hour. Serve with egg sauce or 
other kinds suitable for boiled fish, and 
a spoonful of potato. 



722—Potatoes, HoUandaise. 

Cut raw potatoes in quarters lenghtwise 
as if to be fried, then trim to a rough 
kidney shape, boil in salted water, take 
off before they break, drain, and sprinkle 
with parsley, melted butter, salt and 
lemon juice. Serve with the fish on the 
same plate. 

There used to be a Dutch kidney potato 
of small size but much esteemed, w^^^^ 
these cut potatoes are intended to imitate 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

and, like those of Holland, are to be 
simply cooked. 



723— Fricassee of Chicken, Parisienne. 



Cut tender chickens in joints, pepper 
and salt and roll in flour, either fry or 
bake brown^ using enough oil, clarified 
butler or drippings to baste with. Make 
yellow fricassee sauce — that is, white 
sauce with yolk of.egg added and lemon 
juice and cayenne, and prepare a pint 
cupful of Parisienne potatoes. Serve 
sauce in the dish, piece of chicken in it, 
potatoes around and, if wished, decorate 
further with button mushrooms same size 
as the potatoes. 

Fricassee, is the French word for 
fry, and seems to have meant fried 
chicken with sauce at first, but fricassees 
are variously put up. The term "Parisi- 
enne," is one of the convenient designa- 
tions that, like "a la Russe," means but 
little and does no harm. Two chickens 
can be cut into 28 or 30 pieces. 



724 — Haricot of Mutton, Bourgeoise. 



Haricot, is the name of a stew of meat 
with vegetables in it. Bourgeoise signi- 
fies that it is common — in family style. 
Haricots is also the French for beans. 
Cut up the breast and neck of mutton, 
brown it first in a pan either in oven or 
on top of stove, with frequent stirring. 
Then put in a saucepan with turnip, car- 
rot and onion cut in large pieces. Stew 
till tender, season plainly with salt and 
depper and thicken the liquor. 

725— Beets Plain. 



Boil the beets, peel in cold water, cut 
them in dice size of cherries, season with 
salt and one spoonful of roast meat fat 
shaken about in them to keep them from 
drying out and serve so without sauce. 



726— Tapioca Custard Pudding. 

I heaping cup tapioca—^ pound. 

6 cups milk — 3 pmts. 

Yi cup sugar— 4 ounces. 

I ounce butter— small egg size. 

4 eggs, or 8 yolks. 



Crush the tapioca, if the large and 
rough kind, put it to soak in half the milk 
for 2 hours. 

Boil the other half the milk \yith the 
sugar in it, stir in the soaked tapioca, let 
simmer slowly at the side or in a pan oi 
boiling water for half an hour, or until 
the tapioca is become transparent and 
well cooked. Then stir in the butter and 
eggs and bake. Serve with sauce. This 
makes over 2 quarts, about 24 portions, 
costs 20 cents; with sauce ij^ cents each 
person.

727 — Barley Soup a la Princess or 
Consomme a \ Orge. 



Prepare 5 quarts of clear consomme ; 
boil y2 cup pearl barley separately until 
well done, then wash it in a colander in 
plently of water. Cut a piece of carrot 
and turnip in fine dice no larger than the 
barley grains and boil a few minutes.

yolks, take the sauce from the fire before 
It becomes rough with curdling of the 
e^ and strain it over the meat. To 
garnish : Cut out leaf shapes of thin 
puff paste, egi^ over and bake and put one 
or two in each dish when served. 



Anything and every thing you may meet 
with m a bill of far2 that is a V Espagnole 
is in brown meat sauce, either cooked in 
it or has the sauce poured over it. Fish 
cooked in this way is more like meat than 
in any other form. It is not a good way 
with a soft kind of fish or when the sauce 
is too dark. A nice veal gravy and a firm 
whitefish will make a good dish. Split 
the fish, as only smallportions are wanted 
to be served, score on the portions, with- 
out cutting through. Brush a little fat 
over the baking pan, lay the fish skin 
side up; cut carrot, turnip and onion 
in very small dice and strew a small por- 
tion in the spaces in the pan, dredge salt 
and pepper and bake about 15 minutes. 
Then pour in enough light colored veal 
gravy or Spanish stock sauce (No. 784) to 
come half way up and bake 20 minutes 
longer, basting the fish with the gravy and 
having some left in the pan to serve with 
the fish. Send in some kind of potatoes 
in the same plate. 



731— Brochette of Liver a la Bretonne, 

Make thin slices of liver and equal num- 
ber of bacon and cut them in squares no 
much larger across than a silver quater,^ 
place them on sk-wers alternately, have 
the skewers nearly full. Dip in egg and 
cracker meal and fry light brown, ^erve 
whole or half one to each order, slipping 
them off the skewers and placing in the dish 
first a spoonful of sauce, made by frying 
minced onion light brown, adding brown 
sauce, a spoonful of made mustard and 
same of vinegar. Can also be fried with- 
out breading and served on toast. 

732~Boiled Suet Pudding. 



729— Potatoes a la Julienne. 

Choose the longest potatoes, slice them j 
raw very thinly and then cut the slices in 
shreds thin as shoestrings. Fry in hot 
lard, drain well, sprinkle with salt. 



730— Fricassee cf Veal, Francaise. 



Take veal that is not suitable for cut- 
lets and cut it in square pieces, put in a 
frying pan with a little oil, butter or 
roast meat fat and fry (saute) over the 
fire until it is light brown. Put in water 
or stock enough to cover, add a minced 
onion and little grated nutmeg and let 
stew until tender. Take out the pieces 
of meat into another saucepan so that you 
can thicken the liquor, which requires 
about I spoonful of 3 our thickening and 
2 yolks of eggs or according to quantity, 
and add salt, pepper and juice of half a 
lemmon. Immediately after adding the 



4 cups flour— a pound. 
2 large cups minced suet — 6 ounces. 
I cup sugar — J^ pound. 
I large cup raisins or currants — Y^ 
pound. 
I cup milk. 

Pinch of soda and little salt. 

The suet should be selected, free from 
skin and meat and minced very fine. Rub 
it into the flour. Put in the other in- 
gredients, stii together very thoroughly. 
Tie up in a pudding bag and boil 4 or ^ 
hours. Take up only just before it is 
wanted as it is best when first taken from 
the pot. Serve slices with sauce. Three 
pounds costs 19 cents. 



733— Silver Pudding Sauce, or Sweet 
Velante. 

I cup powdered sugar, 

Vz cup butter. 

3 whites of eggs. 

3 tablespoons brandy or little flavoring 
extract. 

It is hard sauce (No. 177) improved by 
having whipped white ot eeg stirred in 
while it is still soft. It should be made

the last thing before dinner and then kept 
cold as the whites go down with standing. 

734— Pound Cakes, Assortsd Kinds. 

4 cups sugar — light weight of 2 pounds. 

4 small cups butter — \% pounds. 

20 eggs. 

8 rounded cups flour— 2 pounds good 
weight. 

Warm the butter and sugar to soften, 
then stir them to a cream, add eggs two 
at a time and work them in, then the flour. 
No powder or raising of any kind wanted 
but a good beating at the last to make 
the cake fine grained, and pound cake 
should not be flavored. 

Having made the above you can bake 
part of it m a deep mould for pound 
cake; spread some on jelly cake pans 
for jelly cake or any other kind of layer 
cake ; bake one sheet thin on a baking 
pan and frost over when done for mer- 
ingue cake, put citron, raisins or currants 
in some of it, or mix in some melted 
chocolate.

means mushrooms, shalots or green onions 
and i3arsley minced and mixed together 
in a light brown sauce. 

Take whitefish when fresh and firm, 
cut the two sides from the back bone, 
then holding them flat on the table slice 
them the flat way again with a very 
sharp knife to make thm, broad pieces, 
(jut these in strips, double them as you

The slices must be thin ana oi a choice 
cut to look well ; scraps and fragments, will 
make other dishes ; the leg or best meat 
of the loin and ribs will make escalopes. 

Cut like small thin steaks about half as 
large as the palm of the hand, season with 
a ckedging of spiced salt, or with salt and 
pepper only, egg and bread them in 
cracker meal, lay in a buttered pan, 
moisten with oil, clear butter or fresh

Put into a small bright saucepan 4 ta- 
blespoons vinegar and I of minced young 
onions, and boil ; add 2 ounces bcsi but- 
ter (large eg;^ size) and then 4 yolks and 
stir over the fire until it begins to thicken ;

mushrooms and truffles, little salt, cay- 
enne and finely minced parsley. It is to 
be cooked enough to set the egg yolks to 
a buttery thickness, but not enough to 
cause them to break into curds. 

There was a king called Henry the 
Bearnaise. The wordrefers either to him 
or his country. 



Thin slices ham half the size that are 
used for breakfast will do for this. Spread

745— Trouble wnh the Fruit Jellies 



This is about jelly that "wouldn't jell". 
It was beautifully pink and clear, how- 
ever, that is the jelly which the lady of 
the house and her maids made was, 
while a quart that the cook made in a 
sort of short order way for present use 
was not clear and was rather dark ; but it 
was solid enough to slice when cold. 
Probably the difference was caused in 
part by the little lot that was made in 
haste, having plenty of sugar and the 
large^ lot that took all the afternoon and 
evening to boil and all night to stand and 
get cold and thin "wouldn't jeU" and had 
to go it all over again, had not. They 
talked about it beforehand and intended 
to have the jelly as good as could be 
made (for small fruit is very abundant 
here, the best costing only 6 to 8 cents a 
quart,) but came to a wrong decision 
about the amount of sugar; one said that 
the rule was to use a pint of sugar to every 
pint of fruit juice — that is a pound to a 
pound—bLt then, they said, that was for 
jelly to put away in glass jars or tumblers 
and keep for a year or more, only to bring 
out for company, and they^ only wanted 
this to keep through the winter and use 
it when needed and it seemed as though 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a 
pound (or pint) of juice ought to do, so 
that was what they allowed and the result 
was the jelly "wouldn't jell." Perhaps it 
would have "iell'd" if they had boiled it 
down more ; out then there would not 
have been so much of it and it would 
have been as dear as if it had more sugar. 
I think after all that it was the house- 
keeper who was to blame, but the jelly 
stayed soft and they put it back in the ket- 
tle next day and put in a lot more sugar 
without weighing or measuring, only be- 
ing sure to give it plenty and then boiled 
it all the afternoon and it came out all 
right, at least so far as setting solid was 
concerned, but it was not fine jelly after 
that, the second boiling took away the 
good color. They had better have al- 



lowed pound for pound at first. It is 
very likely the cook was half-way glad 
that jelly "wouldn't jell" through covet- 
ousness ; for he knew that whether good 
or bad none of it would come to him and 
there were pound layer cakes made last 
evening waiting for jelly to spread them 
with, tarts for dmner that wanted jelly and 
some white cake layers to come yet with 
the ice cream, but he went on saying the 
jell that all are praising is not the jell for 
me, and took 2 quarts of ripe gooseber- 
ries in a small tin pan with a cover and 
put in ^2 cup water and parboiled them 
with the steam shut in about ten minutes, 
then rubbed the pulp and juice through 
a fine stramer, added 2 cups sugar, set 
the pan on top of a stove-lid to hold it up 
from the stove, and let simmer without 
further attention for 2 hours. Produced 
I quart dark red jelly very firm ; good for 
all ordinary uses in pastry; cost : 2 qua ts 
berries 16, and i lb. sugar 8 — 24 cents. 

To make really cheap jellies it is neces- 
sary to use apple's at the cheapest season; 
proceed the same as above named for 
gooseberries and either mix the juice of 
other fruits with the apple juice to get 
various kinds, or else merely color and 
flavor it as desired. 



Hurrah for fresh vegetables and sea 
fish! First arrival. Right here in the 
heart of an agricultural country canned 
goods are used as much as a matter of 
course ^ as if it were a mountain camp ; 
find it is about as difficult to buy poultry 
as it would be to buy a turtle or terrapin ; 
perhaps these could be obtained by ex- 
press m even less rime than it would take 
to find a farmer with young ducks or 
chickens so sell. Instead of inquiring 
whether a resort is situated in a good 
farming region, people who desire all the 
luxuries of the season would do better to 
ascertain if the express companies reach 
the point in question. Received : 

1 bbl new potatoes, 3 bu @ 75.

al form in the same plate, and tartar 
sauce in a separate dish. 



748— Tartar Sauce. 



746— Consomme Solferino. 



A clear brown consomme with white 
quenelles in the plates. 

When boilin:^ the strained broth to 
clarify it (as at No. 139) add a tablespoon- 
ful of whole cloves and alspice, giving the 
finished consomme a spicy flavor, and 
add a little extract ot meat or a well 
browned roast chicken to color and en- 
rich it. To make the quenelles; boil V2 
cup farina in three times as much milk, 
as at No. 761, making a stiff porridge ot 
it, add salt, nutmeg and two raw yolks, 
pound all together, let cool, then roll up 
m balls, size of cherries ; boil them in 
water a few minutes, drain off and put 
half a dozen in each plate. 



It is mayonaise sauce with minced 
pickle, capers and onion added. 

Put 2 raw yolks into a pint bowl, add 
a tablespoon of salad oil and stir to- 
gether with an egg beater, add more oil 
and continue stirring, throw in ^ tea- 
spoon of salt and it will become thick al- 
most immediately ; then add a teaspoon 
of vinegar, then 2 of oil and continue un- 
til you have enough for the purpose con- 
stantly^ stirring the sauce, adding oil twice 
and vinegar once alternately and always 
in very small portions, and at the finish 
or when you have near a cupful, squeeze 
in the juice of half a lemon. Mustard 
and cayenne may be added if wished, but 
are not essential mgredients of mayonaise 
sauce. 

Mince a few capers and piece of green 

gickle and a young onion or two extremely 
ne, drain fhe mince on a napkin, stir it 
into the mayonaise and you have tartar 
sauce. Serve cold in individual sauce 
dishes or large butter chips. 

749— Potatoes a la Gastroncme. 



747— Fried Black Bass, Tartar Sauce 



Split the fish, divest them of skin, 
which can be done by cutting close with 
a sharp knife or else by dippmg in hot 
water; cut m small pieces, salt well, roll 
in Hour only, and fry in a kettle of hot 
Kird. Serve with potatoes in some speci- 



Cut raw potatoes in shape of bottle 
corks, which is done by first cutting in 
thick slices and then with an apple corer 
or funnel or a column cutter of graded 
size proper for the purpose. Boil in 
salted water and then fry in fresh hot 
lard and drain on a sieve. Sprinkle with 
minced parsley, lemon juice and a little 
clear butter, shake up and serve 3 or 4 in 
each plate with the fish. 



750— Beef a la Mode Jardiniere. 

Take a lean piece of beef— about 1% 
pounds, and J^ pound salt pork and a tur- 
nip and carrot. Choose the pork fat close 
to the skin because it is tou^h enough 
to lard with without breaking. Cut it in 
strips rather thinner than a common 
pencil and cut ihe turnip and carrot the 
same wajr. Fill the piece of beef full of 
these strips drawing them in with 
a larding needle. Put the beef with the

fn^ments of pork and vegetables into 
a saucepan, add an onion with a few 
cloves stuck in it, a bay leaf and soup 
stock to nearly cover and simmer with 
the lid on or in the oven 2 or 3 hours. 
Take it up, either make sauce in the 
same or add some Spanish sauce, (No. 
784) and a little wine, strain, skim off the 
fat and serve in the dish with the meat 
carefully sliced across the larding and 
garnish with a few shapes stamped out 
of cooked vegetables and warmed in 
sauce. Small larding is necessary to 
make this a desirable dish ; the slices of 
meat should show spots no larger than 
French peas. 

751— Epigramme of Lamb aTAIIe- 
mande. 

It is lamb stew with German dump- 
lings, Ailemande signifying German. 
The sauce is light yellow, the dumplings 
raised with yeast and strained separ- 
ately. Chop the breast of lamb mto 
strips, then into pieces of 3 or 4 ribs, 
wasn, stew with a few cut vegetables and 
season. Take out the meat when done 
—which will be in less than an hour if 
young lamb, strain the liquor, add a 
thickening of flour and 2 yolks. Let the 
yolks be added after the flour has boiled 
up in it and do not let boil again. 
Throw in a little minced ])arsley and 
pour tne sauce over the pieces of meat. 
Serve one piece of lamb with sauce ana 
a dumpling at one end. 



752— German Dumplings without 
tggs or Powder. 

Leave put a piece of roll dough from 
the breakfast breads and keep ic cool. 
About 2 hours before dinner make it out 
in round balls, set them in steamers, 
takmg care not to cover all the holes, 
grease the tops to prevent drying, let 
rise an hour, steam about fifteen 
minutes. Serve as pot pie dumplings or 
m such dishes as the preceding, or with 
sweet sauce or fruit or butter and sugar 
to take the place of pudding. 

753— Queen Fritters Beignets Souffles. 

1 cup water— ^ pint full measure. 



2 ounces butter or lard — large egg size. 

I round cup flour — 4 ounces. 

5 eggs. 

Set the water on to boil in a saucepan 
and the butter (or lard) in it. Stir in the 
flcur air at once and work the paste thus 
made with a spoon till smcctn and well 
cooked . Take it from the fire and work 
in the eggs one at a time, beating in one 
well before adding another, and when 
all are in beat the mixture thoroughly 
against the side of the saucepan. Make 
some lard hot. It will take half a sauce- 
panful. Drop pieces of the batter about 
as large as eggs and watch them swell 
and expand in the hot lard and become 
hollow and light. Only four or five at 
a time can be fried because they need 
plenty of room. 

If dropped small, say, not mueh larger 
than a walnut, the above will make 25 
fritters. They show their remarkable 
lightness better, however, when made 
larger. 



754— Sauce Sabiyon. 



Boil together i cup su2;ar and ^ cup 
water and thicken with cornstarch. 
Beat 2 or 3 yolks in a bowl with 4 table- 
spoons of wine and 2 of sugar; when it 
is frothy with beating ppur the thickened 
sauce to it, whisk again and serve as 
sauce to fritters and puddings. Other 
flavorings can be used, rum is frequently 
employed or brandy when for plum pud- 
ding. The golden sauce No. 743 is 
nearly the same thing if whisked to a 
foam, and does not require liquor or 
wine — which suits a temperance house 
like this we are writing of.

Total $4 39: 35 persons; 12^ cents a 
plate. 



755 — Puree^of White Beans or, Potage 
a la Conde. 

It is bean soup with milk- added— a 
cream of beans. Take : 

4 cups beans. 

I large onion, carrot, turnip. 
I lb lean salt pork. 

5 or 6 quarts soup stock 
I or 2 quarts milk. 

Soak the beans in water over night ; put 
them in with the vegetables either whole 
or in large pieces and boU in the soup 
stock until the beans are quite soft. The 
pork which is for seasoning need only be 
boiled in it an hour then taken up and 
kept for some other use, as for baked 
beans etc. 

Half an hour before dinner take out 
the vegetables and pass the soup and 
beans ttirough a sieve or strainer into the 
soup pot. iioil the milk, add a little 
thickening then pour through a strainer 
into the puree of beans. Season and 
serve with small conae crusts of a very 
light color — dried instead of toasted. See 
also No. 182. The French word prob- 
ably has reference to a Prince de conde 
who was very popular in his time. 



756— Sliced Tomatoes. 

While it is quicker and easier to peel 
tomatoes if they are first scalded in hot 
water, they are never so good afterwards, 
and some people take a little more time 
and patience and peel them with a sharp 
knife without scalding. That is the best 



way. Keep cold and serve with pieces of 
ice upon them. 

These belong to the list of cold hors d* 
otfffure or side dishes; their place in the 
bill of fare is after the soup when soup is 
the first dish named; but if raw oysters or 
clams precede the soup, the tomatoes, 
cucumbere, olives and similar articles 
will be written after them. Being gener- 
ally placed on the table before the begin- 
ning of dinner some latitude is taken by 
the guests as to the time of partaking of 
such relishes and salads according to in- 
dividual preferences. 



757 — Salmon au Gratin. 



Means that it is browned in the oven- 
A gratin is a baking pan ; anything grati- 
nated is toasted or browned. 

Take half the salmon and lay it open 
without quite dividing; take off the skin 
with a sharp knife, moisten the fish with 
a little olive oil, pepper and salt, and let 
lie in the pan an hour or two. An hour 
before dinner make some fresh roast meat 
fat hot in the pan and bake brown in 
about half an hour, basting once or twice 
with clear butter. Drain away the grease , 
or move the fish into a clean pan. Serve 
small portions cut with a fish slice with 
tartar sauce at the side and potatoes in 
some special form on the same plate. 



758 — Potatoes a la Marechale. 



The name for the familiar browned 
whole potatoes with the difference, how- 
ever, that these must be all quite round 
and of one size, made so by cutting out 
with the largest size of potato spoon 
which forms them large as crab apples or 
small tomatoes. New potatoes of a 
round smooth sort scraped serve the pur- 
pose. Put them in a pan with roast meat 
tat and cook brown in the oven. Serve 
with fish or entrees. 



759— Entrecote of Pork, Dauphinoise. 

Entrecote signifies choice piece, middle 
cut, the cut between the ribs, generally 
applied to beef. The use of it is to inti- 
mate that it is not plain roast pork but 
something seasoned. 

Cut the meat from the back bone of a 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



90 



loin or rack of young pork in one long fil- 
let and a portion of the flank with it. 
Make a roll of it that will be quite small ; 
split the meat if too large when rolled and 
make two. Before rolling: up spread 
upon it a seasoning of finely minced on- 
ion, powdered sa^e or rosemary, bayleaf 
^o powdered, salt and a little cayenne, 
tie up with twine, cook in soup stock a 
while without browning, then roll in egg 
and cracker meal and bake brown. Bake 
a few small tomatoes set far apart in a 
pan so that they will dry away from their 
juice, and also a few small onions and 
when time to serve put a spoonful of 
gravy into the small dish, a slice of the 
roll of pork and baked tomato and 
browned onion at the ends for garnish. 
Dauphinoise is equivalent to saying after 
the manner of the people of Dauphmy. 



760— Kromeskies a la Russe. 



Kromeskies are a kind of meat fritter 
or fish or ovster fritter; for krom- 
eskies can Se made of anything 
that will make croquettes. Mince 
some veal, lamb or chicken very 
fine ; season with spiced salt, or salt, pep- 
per and nutmeg, mix with a little very 
stiff sauce made by stirring butter and 
flour over the fire and adding broth or 
water, taking care not to get in too much 
liquor. When cold roll up the prepara- 
tion like very small sausages; dip mtothin 
fritter batter and fry light colored in fresh 
lard. Serve with a spoonful of good 
white sauce placed previously in the dish 
and sprinkle with finely minced parsley. 
As these are fried they should be laid on 
paper to drain. Very few are called for 
at the first time of i:ervng, the name not 
being tamiiiar to many, and expensive 
ingreaients may as well be omitted. 
Make kromeskies oi game or lobster same 
way. 



761— Boiled Farina Pudding. 

4 cups milk — a quart. 
I small cup farina — 4 ounces. 
J^ cup sugar. 
I or 2 yolks. 
Butter size of an egg. 
Boil the milk with the sugar in it, beat 
in the farina with an egg whisk the same 



as making mush. When well mixed put 
a lid on and let it cook an hour; set it on 
a brick to raise it from the fire, or in a 
farina kettle. Beat in the butter before 
serving and the yolks first beaten with a 
little milk. The pudding need not be 
baked. Serve with sauce. 



762— Coffee Ice Creania 

I quart pure sweet cream- 

I cup sugar. 

y^ cup strong clear coffee^ 

Mix and fir^eze. 

In order to obtain coffee strong enough 
not to dilute the cream a cup of made 
coffee can be boiled up with a heaping 
tablespoon of ground coffee and then 
strained into the cream. It is not best to 
make it too highly flavored.

or aux Pates d' Italie. 

It is clear consomme made as for royal 
(No. I j9) with some sort of Italian pastes 
cooked separately, washed free from meal 
and put in. These are various, such as 
alphabet pastes of the same material as 
macaroni stamped in letters or in fancy 
figures. There is a short kind of maca- 
roni for the purpose, or common maca- 
roni may be cooked and afterwards cut 
into quarter inches and put in the con- 
somme. Fidelini, spaghetti and lasagnes

767— Sauce Robert 



Have some water boiling ready, throw 
in salt enough to make it taste, and half

Cook potatoes with the skins on, peel 
when done and cut in quarters. Take up

with a drainer or false bottom to boil fish 
in) serve small portions individually with 
the prepared butter for sauce and the cut 
potatoes on the same plate. 



Named after a French restauranteur of 
the last century who made it known and 
valued as an accompaniment to broiled 
pork. 

Mince an onion extremely fine and stir 
over the fire in a small saucepan with a 
little oil or clear butter until it is cooked 
and beginning to brown, then put in a 
little made mustard, a tablespoonful of

771— Cream Soup, a la Duchesse. 



A rich white soft soup like cream of 
chicken with egg custards. 

Boil either a chicken or white veal in 
the stock until quite tender; chop in the 
meat and pound it in a mortar. Boil a 
cup of rice and when done and drained 
pound it also with the meat and pass 
throuh a sieve. Use 4 or 5 quarts of 
seasoned stock, 2 or 3 quarts rich milk 
and the puree of chicken and rice to 
thicken. 

Beat 4 eggs slightly, season with nut- 
meg, salt and pepper; put in a deep pan

Take cold cooked salmon which may 
have been left from a previous day and 
some other fish or canned salmon to make

bread and cracker meal in equal quanti- 
ties. Butter a baking pan, cover the 
bottom with the crumbs, place fish enough 
to cover that, and plenty of crumbs again 
on top. 

Take soup stock and milk if to be in 
plain style, or soup stock and white wine 
if that way, enough to thoroughly moisten, 
season with pepper and salt, pour over 
the scallop and bake brown. Cut out 
squares, place on the dishes as neatly as 
possible, add a border of frizzed potatoes 
for decoration. 



773— Frizzed Potatoes.

slices upon each other and shred them. 
Fry almost white in fresh lard. Serve as

Small selected veal steaks, size of the 
palm of the hand, larded with a few strips 
of fat pork, baked in a quick oven, served | 
with sauce in the dish. 

Slice the leg of veal for them and use 
the trimmings in soup or stews. Draw 
the lardoons through so that a dozen ends 
will cluster in the middle of each p;rena- 
din. Butter a pan, strew a very little 
rainced onion, salt and pepper ; place the 
veal close together; bake light brown. 
Have some clear soup stock boiled down 
to glaze and baste them with it while bak- 
ing. 



775— Sauce Napolitaine. 

Mk grated horseradish in thin white 
sauce, made by tnickening strong chicken 
broth with white roux . Butter sauce di- 
luted will answer the purpose ordinarily — 
the horseradish is the chief ingredient. 

776— Brcchettes cf Kidneys and Ham. 



I cup vinegar. 

I cup water. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

I tablespoon butter. 

1 tablespoon salt. 

Shred the cabbage fine, mix the yolks 
well with some water, put everything 
into a saucepan or into the sink of the 
steam chest and stir occasionally until it 
reaches boiling point ; then keep it where 
it will not boil. This makes a yellow sort 
of cream dressing in the cabbage; but 
boiling curdles the egg and would make 
it noc so good. Add minced red pepper 
if you have it; some add sugar. 

779— Hot :>law Another Way. 



Slice up the kidneys that may have ac- 
cumulated, and small pieces of ham, cut 
them to one size as near as can be, and 
not larger than a silver half dollar. Run 
them on iron skewers, a slice of kidney 
and a slice of ham alternately until 
the skewers are full. Trim off comers 
with a straight cut, lay in a pan and bake. 
Serve in a spoonlul of sauce in the dish, 
pushing off the portion from the skewer 
with a fork. 

These may also be fried in hot fat and 
served for breakfast; also breaded and 
fried. 

777— ^auce Claremonl. 



The common hotel way of making hot 
slaw is to put the shred cabbage into a 
large saucepan with roast meat or bacon 
fat and vinegar and stir it over the fire 
until the cabbage is partly cooked and 
the vinegar has dried out, making a sort 
of imitation of sour krout ; it is cheap. 

730— Steamed Pound Pudding. 

I pound sugar — any kind. 

^/i pound butter. 

lo eggs. 

I pound flour. 

Stir the butter and sugar together ; add 
the eggs, two at a time, not beaten ; when 
' all are in add the flour. Beat up well. 
' Use part to steam in a mould or pan for 
pudding. It takes from one to one and 
a half hours to steam ; must have a good 
lid on or paper cover under the lid and 
plenty of steam. As the pudding is sliced 
like cake and "goes a good way" there 
will be some of the batter to spare to 
bake a pound cake at the same time. 
Serve sauce with the pudding. If no 
wine, add some fruit juice to the syrup 
made of sugar and starch and boil until 
clear. 



Mince onions and stir over the fire in a 
little oil until cooked ; add brown sauce 
or light veal gravy; skim off the oil as it 
rises. 



778— Hot Slaw. 



I or 2 heads white cabbage. 



781— Apple Tarts. 



Made of pufi* paste and cooked apple 
put through a colander and well sweet- 
ened. Canned apples will answer when 
fresh cannot be had. 

Roll out puff paste, cut flats and line 
large patty pans or jem pans, put in a

tablespoonof apple and bake. A favor- 
ite sort of pastry, richer than apple pie 
and sells well at the fine bakeries. 



782— Eclairs a la Crcme 



The French name for cream puffs No. 
288 when filled with whipped cream. In 
places where pure cream can be obtain- 
ed, as at this summer resort, instead of 
using the pastry custard take cream, set 
in a pan ot ice water, sweeten, and then 
whip with the wire egg-whisk until it is 
frothy and thick. Flavor with vanilla or 
lemon ; cut the puffs open at top fill with 
whipped cream and replace the piece. 
Cream puffs can be made for 15 cents a 
dozen of small size with eggs at a low price, 
and cream.

to it a pound of sultana seedless raisins .

away to become cold. The fat can be 
taken off when cold. There should 
not be enough tomatoes used to make 
everything the sauce c^oesm taste of them. 
The uses of this Spanish sauce are to 
add to soups of several kinds. Mock Tur- 
tle, green turtle and other such soups are 
half made when this sauceismade,anda 
number of brown sauces need only cer- 
tain other ingredients, such as fried min- 
ced onion or mushrooms to be added to 
the stock sauce, to bring them to an easy 
completion.

786— Redfioh au Court-Boulllcn. 



788— Fricandeau of Veil, < alienne. 



This is on 2 of the specialties of New 
Orleans and all Southern holels and res- 
taurants. The court-bouillon is not the 
same seasoned stock for boiling a whole 
fish in, that is generally kn9wn by that 
name and which contams wine, but is a 
sort of soup of onions, th5mie, garlic, 
olive oil and tomatoes in which the slices 
offish are stewed and both fish and sauce 
served together . No one of the ingredients 
named should be in excess, but all in 
moderate proportions. It is a standing 
dish on the breakfast bills of fare of the 
best hotels in the Southern cities,trout, 
snapper, or other good fish taking the 
place according to the market . Without 
expecting it to meet with any particular 
appreciation in this little community. I 
let it appear once for novelty, our butch- 
er's little shipment of sea fishes allowing 
the opportunity . 



It is a piece of veal larded, cooked and 
glazed in its own gravy. Take any lean 
piece such as the shoulder with the bone 
I removed, or part of the flank, or the leg 
! and lard it full of strips of fat salt pork 
the same as for beef a la mode or larded 
and braised tongue. Cut the pork close 
to the skin and it will be found better to 
lard with than bacon, which is too strong- 
ly flavored. The larding finished, put 
the scraps of pork in a baking pan of 
i small size and depth, also some pieces of 
I turnip, carrot and onion, sweet herbs if 
I at hand, such as thyme and parsley ; put 
i in the veal, thin a little broth and wine, 
I cover with a buttered paper and bake in 
i a moderate oven about an hour, basting 
I occasionally . 

I Take up the meat when done in anoth- 

I er pan, strain the remaining liquor, skim 

I it, glaze the meat by pouring it over and 

I letting dry in the hot closet. Slice the 

meat so that the lardings will show and 

serve small cuts with Italian sauce in the 

dish and two or three olives for garnish.

which loses color in the sauce and add it 
iT\ each dish . If Spanish sauce be at hand 
i» can be used in place of meat gravy. 



790— Small Patties a la Toulouse 



Puff paste shells filled with a ragout 
of brains, chicken and mushrooms . 

Boil the brains taken from the calf s 
head used for soup, cut when cold into 
large dice, cut white meat of chicken the 
same way and slice a proportion of mush- 
rooms . It does not take much to fill pat- 
ties, perhaps half cupful of each will be 
sufficient . Make white sauce, season well, 
put in the meats and keep hot to fill the 
patties with as wanted. Toulouse is a 
part of France where the most mush- 
rooms were found before they were 
grpwn artificially.

Almost the same as royal. No. 139. 
The egg custards can be cut with a round 
cutter instead of in diamonds, and add 
a half pint of Madeira or sherry. A lib- 
eral allowance of extract of meat should 
be used when desired to make this con- 
somme of good quality in places where 
there is no poultry to be had, and the ex- 
tract makGS it unnecessary to use color- 
ing,as it imparts a very rich color itself.

may be expected to contain curry pow- 
der or curry paste. 

Brush a "baking pan or dish with but- 
ter, skin 3 lbs of fish and cut it into suit- 
able pieces to serve. About half the peo- 
ple will not take fish and this amount 
will make from 24 to 30 portions. Place 
them in the dish m close order. 

Take some cooked rice, season it with 
salt and milk and i egg or the yolk only 
and make a raised border of it all around 
the edge of the baking dish. Use a wet 
knife to smooth it over. Set the dish in 
the oven for 15 minutes for the fish to be- 
come partly cooked then pour in enough 
curry sauce to almost cover, and bake 
a^ain until the surface of both fish and 
nee border is brown. Serve a portion 
of rice with each order and the curry 
sauce belonging.

7S5— Curry Sance 

Mince an onion extremely fine, put it 
in a small saucepan with butter and stir 
over the fire until it is cooked without 
browning ; put in three times as much 
grated cocoanut as there was onion (dry 
cocoanut will do but not sweet) and a 
heaped teaspoonful of curry powder. 
When these are hot add a pmt of light 
brown sauce (No 576) or Spanish sauce or 
fresh made gravy from the meat pans. 
Skim off the tat, add a pinch of cayenne 
and pour it over the fish or chicken or 
whatever is ta be baked in the above re- 
ceipt. 



796— Call's Head, a ta lortue, orin 
Turtle Style. 



Calf s head previously cooked, cut in 
pieces in a brown sauce contaming olives, 
mushrooms, wine quenelles or egg balls 
and mushroom liquor. Cut the half head 
and the boneless feet reserved from the 
mock turtle soup, making into pieces of 
even size and put them in a saucepan of 
Spanish sauce (No 784) or good bright 
pan gravy with a seasoning of tomato, 
add a small portion of each of the ingre- 
dients above named, and make hoi . The 
olives should have the stones taken out 
by means of a small corer out of the col- 
umn box, or by running a penknife 
around. It is a great improvement to 
the appearance to add egg-balls as a gar- 
niture. Tortue is French for turtle.

799~Scallops of Mutton, Provencale 
or Creole 

A scallop of meat is'a thin slice or steak, 
as is the Scotch coUop and the French 
escalope. Anything a la Provencale in 
French cookery is the same as a la Creole 
in American, it implies tomatoes, onions, 
cayenne, oil, wine and sometimes garlic. 

For this dish cut small slices of mutton, 
saute them first in a frying pan, light 
brown, then simmer in water, stock or 
sauce until they are tender and add suf- 
ficient strained tomatoes to serve as a 
sauce. Season the^ meat and sauce 
while stewing with onion, salt and pepper, 
A leaf shape of fried bread is a good orn- 
ame*it to the dish.

Make drawn butter (butter sauce) a lit- 
tle thinner than usual for that sauce, with 
a liberal amount of the best butter beaten 
in. Add the juice of half a lemon, some 
minced parsley and minced capers. A 
cupful of sauce is enough and the expense 
is small for just sufficient to fill the bill . 



804 — Potatoes a la Dauphine. 



They are potato croquettes of a flat- 
tened shape. 

Take 4 or 5 potatoes out of the steam-

Make them out in flattened pats, very 
much like figs as they are pressed in boxes, 
dip in egg and cracker meal and fry to a 
fine yellow color in hot lard . Serve with 
fish or with meat entrees. Potatoes in 
this form are fine as ornaments but most 
tedious of any to prepare, requiring three

Total, $5.44; 48 persons; 11^ cents a

The dinner above prepared for 48 was 
partaken of by only 37, the others being 
out on excursions, i here will be some 
waste and things available — such as cold 
meats — for succeeding meals, and pastry- 
cake and ice cream disappear by myster- 
ious means after meals and at night. 

813— Consomme Milanaise. 



Clear consomme with short cut maca- 
roni or spaghetti or fidelini in it and red 
corned or smoked tongue cut in shreds 
size of Julienne vegetables. Cook the 
macaroni or spaghetti separately, wash 
off in cold water and place ready to drop 
a spoonful in each plate — precaution to 
avoid spoiling the clearness of the con- 
somme. The shred tongue makes no 
difference. 



814— Fillets of Trout,a la Morny 

Small fillets doubled up in order in 
a dish, a raised border of potato around 
and all baked brown, with sauce. 
Morny is the title of a French duke. A 
large platter such as is used to dish up a 
whole turkey for a family dinner, should 
be devoted to the purpose of cooking fish 
in this way, which is like the rice-bor- 
dered dish No. 794, and if it can be a 
metal chafing-dish of the same shape it, 
will be the better. If no dish can be had 
a shallow baking pan can be made to an- 
swer tolerably well, but it does not hold 
the border above the fish gravy. 

Cut as many thin slices lengthwise of 
the fish as there will be orders, which 
may be about two thirds the number of 
people, place them, doubled, close to- 
gether till the dish is full. Mash potatoes 
with egg-yolk salt and nutmeg same as 
for croquettes and make a border all a- 
round and brush with egg. Mince a 
small onion, twice as much mushrooms, 
strew them amongst the fillets. Add half 
cup white wine to a pint or white sauce 



(No. 819) pour over the fish and bake on 
the bottom of the oven about half an. 
hour. Serve potatoes, a fillet of fish and 
some of the sauce in the same plate. 



815— Yorkshire Pudding with Riast 
Meats. 

A rich egg-batter pudding; can also be 
served with sweet sauce. 

lYz cups flour — 6 ounces. 

3 cups milk — V/2, pints. 

I ounce butter, melted. 

3 eggs. 

Salt. 

y^ teaspoon baking powder. 

Mix the flour and milk carefully not 
to have it full of lumps, add the melted 
butter, salt, pinch of powder, the eggs well 
beaten and beat up thoroughly. Butter 
a small baking pan and make it warm in 
the oven, pour the batter in only about 
y^ inch deep and bake 15 or 20 minutes. 
Water instead of milk can be used, but 
then a tablespoon of syrup should be ad- 
ded to cause it to brown quickly without 
drying out. Cut squares and serve with 
roast beei and gravy. 



816— Lamb Slew, a la Jardiniere. 



Jardiniere is French for gardener; the 
made jardiniere always implies the use of 
a mixed lot of vegetables. There are 
jardiniere cutters to be bought which cut 
vegetables in various fancy shapes effect- 
ing a great saving of time. 

Chop up the breasts and neck of lamb 
or mutton, stew until tender,^ let boil 
nearly dry, skim, season and thicken the 
liquor that remains. Cut carrots, white 
and yellow turnips, Kohl-rabi or cabbage- 
turnips, leeks, onions and string beans, 
all or any of them, into dice or like peas 
with a scoop cutter, and boil until done, 
drain off and pour some Spanish sauce 
or light brown sauce to them. Serve 
the vegetables as a border in the dish 
with stewed lamb in the center. 



817— Green Corn Fritters. 

I heaped cup com. 
^ cup butter. 
^ cup flour. 



WI 



COOKING JFOR PROFIT, 



I cup milk or water. 

I egg. 

Salt and pepper. 

Batter to fry in. 

The com may be either from a can of 
the dry solid packed sort or else green 
com shaved on the cob. 

Make white roux first by stirring the 
butter and flour over the fire, add milk to 
make stiff sauce, stir in the com, season, 
and then put the mixture which is a stiff 
paste an inch deep in the pan to get cold. 
Cut pieces two inches long, dip in thin 
batter (same as if made for pancakes) and 
fry light colored in hot lard . Have a 
cupful of cream sauce ready and serve a 
spoonful under each fritter. Another 
and easier way may be found by refer- 
ence to the index. 



818-— Cabbage au Veloute. 

Means cabbage in white sauce, as en 
Espagnole means brown sauce. Chop 
the cabbage, season it, serve a spoonful 
to a dish with sauce veloute poured over 
it. 



819— Sauce Veloute. 

Is white sauce but not cream sauce 
which latter is called Bechamel. The 
word veloute means velvety or smooth. 
To make the sauce take some chicken or 
veal broth boiled down strong enough to 
be jelly when cold, but, without cooling 
it strain through a napkin and use it to 
make butter sauce thinner than is usually 
made ; and after that let it slowly boil and 
the butter (that the roux was made with) 
will rise to the top. Skim it off and you 
have a bright veloute that is not greasy 
and can be used as a stock sauce for white 
dishes and for fish. This is one of the 
main stock sauces in systematic cookery 
but in point of fact is not so necessary as 
brown sauce and therefore is not made 
in every place. 



820— West Point Pudding. 



Brown cracked wheat pudding with 
molasses and raisins. 
4 heaped cups cracked wheat mush. 
Yi cup molasses. 



1 cup minced suet — ^ ounces, 

2 or 3 eggs, 

3 cups milk. 

I teaspoon ground cinnamon. 

I cup raisins or currants. 

Take cracked wheat mush that was left 
over from breakfast and is well-cooked 
and dry, mix in the other ingredients, 
eggs last and well beaten, and bake in a 
slack oven an hour. Maple symp is good 
sauce for it, but hard sauce (No 177) is, 
the favorite.

plate . 

The dinner above prepared for 46, par-f 
taken by only 37 ; the others away oa 
summer raaibles. 



821— Croute-r.u-Pot Soup. 

Crust-pot or crust soup ; a good soup 
of mixed vegetables and small toast. 
Make the vegetable sou[) No. 140 and 



SAN liRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



jo^ 



add tomatoes, or the tomato soup No. 
1 66, and add more vegetables. Cut 
some slices of bread extremely thin and 
then in small pieces and toast them in 
the oven. Drop a few in each plate when 
serving. 



822--Boiled Whitefish, Parsley Sauce. 



Set on the poissoniere or fish-kettle 
half-full of water, put in an onion stuck 
with cloves, a bayleaf, salt, a handful of 

Earsley and half cup vinegar. When it 
oils put in the fish on the moveable 
drainer bottom and boil gently about half 
an hour. Slide off the drainer on to a 
dish. Serve by cutting portions with a 
broad fish slice. Parsley sauce and new 
I)otatoes in the same plate. 



823— Parsley Sauce. 

Make good butter sauce (No. 573)and 
add to it a cupful of chopped parsley 
while at boiling heat. 



824— Sweetbreads au Beurre Noir 



Some epicures, apparently have discov- 
ered an agreeable new zest in butter 
browned by frying, for it has been em- 
ployed as a flavoring in sweets as well as 
in meat sauces. The English call it nut 
brown butter. Prepare the sweetbreads 
by boiling and pressing and when cold | 
slice thinly, season and dip both sides in ; 
flour and have them ready in a pan. 
Shortly before dinner make a cupful of 
butter hot in a fr^^ing pan. While it is 
frothy and beginnmg to brown lay in the 
floured sweetbreads and give them time 
to get brown on both sides . Serve when 
done with a little of the butter upon them, 
two or three olives and quartei of lemon 
in the dish. 



825— Ragout of Veal, Julienne. 

A ragout is a mixture of meats and 
ther edibles cut small in a sauce. Elab- 
orate mixtures of this sort are some- 
oimes served like a sauce to larger meats, 
and again, are served in this way. Cut 
a piece of veal into large dice and a kid- 
ney and slice or two of salt pork: into 



pieces only half as large. _ Stir them over 
the fire in a saucepan with a spoonful 
of fat or oil until they are slightly browned, 
then drain off all the fat throw in a few 
sliced mushrooms, a sprinkling of onion 
and garlic and pour in enough Spanish 
sauce to cover, or, if no sauce ready use 
light brown gravy. 

For the border cut Julienne vegetables 
as if for soup, boil them, drain, mix in a 
white sauce (some of the same made for 
the fish) and put a spoonful in each dish, 
making a hollow with the spoon and the 
ragout in the middle. 

A Saratoga potato slicer is a help in 
cutting Julienne, which is rather a ted- 
ious operation without. The thin slices 
can be laid together and shreded finely. 



826— Succotash. 



Com and beans mixed together is 
called succotash; butter beans is the 
kind preferred but all sorts of green gar- 
den beans are used. Season as com 
alone would be seasoned, with a little 
sauce made of milk, butter and salt, or, 
with salt alone. 



827— Boiled Lemon Pudding, 



A lemon suet pudding ; pale yellow^ 
rich. 

2 cups flour— J4 pound. 

2 cups minced suet — impound. 

2 solid cups minced bread — j^ pound. 

y2 cup sugar 

2 lemons. 

2 eggs . 

2 cups milk— a pmt. 

V2 teaspoon soda. 

Same of salt. 

Make the bread crumbs fine by grating 
or mincing. Grate the lemon rinds into 
it, put soda in flour, mix dry articles to- 
gether, wet with the eggs and milk and 
stir up thoroughly. Tie up in pudding 
bag or mould and boil 2 hours. Cost 
of pudding 21 cents for 3 pounds or two 
quarts. 

828- Tea Ice Cream. 



Can onlj; be made with pure sweet» 
cream as it is not good with custard or 



^os 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



starch, but fine if made right. Sweeten ( 
2 quarts of cream with 2 cups sugar and 1 
add I cup strong tea made as for drinking 
and freeze as usual.

ments (38 cents.) 

Coffee, tea, butter, bread, sngar (32 
cents.) 

Total $6,36; 43 persons, nearly 15 
cents a plate. 



omitted; for a light brown color is to be 
obtained by some means and meat ex- 
tract is the best where a choice of mate- 
rials for soup making is not offered. 

The consomme having been prepared 
rub some tomatoes through a coarse 
strainer, drain away partof tne juice and 
simmer down the pulp until it is thick; 
add a teaspoon of curry powder and a 
good pincn of cayenne and salt. Drop 
a little into the consonime on serving in 
the plates, without mixing them . 



829— Consomme Calcutta. 

Clear consomme with a teaspoonful of 
pulp of tomato curry, and cayenne (or 
Tobasco or Chili sauce) in each plate. 

Make and clarify the consomme ac- 
cording to directons for royal at No 139 
with the difference that either fowls 
roasted brown or brown glaze made by 
boiling down meat, or else the prepared 
extract of meat should be used to make 
good consomme and coloring substitutes 



830— Fillets of Sole, a la Tartare. 

The sole is a fiat-fish much esteemed 
in the seaports where it is khown and 
often represented by some good substitute 
in the interiors where it is not known. 
The fillets are the boneless strips of fish 
left when the broad spine has been cut 
out and fins removed. 

Roll up the thin fillets, trim one end 
of the roll so that they will stand, dip in 
beaten egg and cracker meal and allow 
to pass inside to stick the wrap together, 
set them in a baking pan, make some lard 
hot and pour around the fillets and so 
bake them brown in the oven. But if 
you have a proper fry-basket you can fry 
them in the usual manner without their 
losing shape. When done drain on a 
sheet of paper laid in a pan, sprinkle 
with fine salt and serve hot with some 
special form of potatoes in the same plate, 
and tartar sauce in a buttei chip, sepa- 
rately. 



831— Potatoes a la Duchesse. 



Take 4 or 5 potatoes out of the dinner 
steamer and mash them with a seasoning 
of salt, the yolk of an egg and grating ot 
nutmeg or pinch of ground mace. When 
perfectly smooth roll it on the flour board, 
cut off balls larger than walnuts, flatten 
and pinch them up to a thick leaf shape, 
mark the tops with back of the knife, set 
in a buttered pan. wash over with egg 
and bake to a fine color . Serve with 
fish or with entrees, as an ornamental 
garnish. 



832— Scrambled Sweetbreads with 
Puree of Peas. 



Cut up cooked sweetbreads into large 



.L.^--^^ 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

dice and put them in a buttered pan into 
about half the amount of raw eggs, or 5 
egjj;s to a pound of sweetbreads. Grate 
in a little nutmeg, add salt and pepper 
and keep covered until time to cook. 
Mash some green peas — the greener the 
better, but those left over from the pre- 
vious day are as good as if newly cooked 
— and rub them through a strainer adding 
a little hot broth or white sauce to help 
pass the puree ; season and set it to get 
warm. 

Stir the sweetbreads and eggs over the 
fire until soft cooked. Place a spoonful 
of the green puree in the small dish in 
the manner of a border and the scram- 
bled sweetbreads in the middle. 



835— Vanilla Jelly. 



Sweet jelly of gelatine (No 465) made 

with a little lemon juice to help in the 

clarifying but without lemon pee land a 

I flavoring of vanilla instead. Color like 

j golden syrup with few drops burnt sugar 

caramel. (See No 694. ) 



833— Pineapole Fritters and Sauce 



Open 2 cans pineapple, save the juice 
cut the larger slices in two. 
For the batter : 
2 cups flour. 

1 small teaspoon baking powder. 

2 eggs . 

I cup milk or water. 

I tablespoon oil or melted lard. 

Pinch of salt. 

Put all at once into a small pail or deep 
pan and beat up with a spoon. Put in 
the pineapple slices, take up well coated 
with batter and drop into a kettle of hot 
lard. Fry light-colored. Drain well and 
break off the rough edges. Serve with 
thick sauce in the dish. To have fritters 
of good shape the batter should be made 
thin. Too much lightness makes them 
absorb grease. To have them of very 
light color use water instead of milk in 
the batter — but some people must have 
them well browned, which calls for milk 
or a spoonful of syrup mixed in . 



834-'Pinaapple Sauce. 



naif pmeapple juice and half water, a 
cup of su^ar to 2 cups of it, and a table- 
spoon of starch . Boil and color pink 
with raspberry or other fruit juice. It 
should be thick enough to coat over a 
fritter and glaze it, and when so used the 
articles arc put on the bill ot fare as **pine- 
apple fritcers glace." 



August 3. 

We_ have a ne\y boarder this morning 
but his meals wili not count at present^ 
Early^ breakfast ordered for a doctor who 
is going away. I hope no sickness has 
broken out at our resort. My "sec" has 
an unusual amount of business to talk 
over with the other girls and has let the 
Lyonaise potatoes burn up. 

At seven o'clock a little three-year-old 
comes running over the croquette ground 
to tell me that the doctor has broughther 
a new brother and I ask her what she'll 
take, but she says ma won't let her eat 
anything before breakfast time. 

There the nurse comes to borrow my 
scales without saying what for. 

When she brings them back she says 
"just twelve pounds and only half-a- 
pound to take off for the wraps. " 

Now, that must be pretty good weight 
for the newspaper paragraphs generally 
quote them at ten j;ounds. You see, 
Mrs Tingee, the effects of good cooking 
and good feeding — everything is sleek 
and fat around here. 



Only 37 is the house-count to-day 
though it went up with the thermometer 
and touched 49 during the week, and I 
expect everyone will be on time to dinner 
as no person in this house excursionize 
on Sunday. If there wis not something 
to expect from the advertising that is cut 
it would look as though the past week was 
the culmination of our season's business 
and small affair it would be. But the 
advertising is bound to work a change ; it 
has torn up all our peace and quietness 
already in one way and made great 
trouble with the meals, getting them or- 
dered an hour earlier or an hour later or 
divided in two or three or turned into half 
meal and half picnic lunch and making 
dinner small and disappointing by the ab- 
sence of guests,and supper large and vex- 
atious through their unwonted promptness 
and inexpressible appetites. For this

COOKING FOR PROFITX 



small but romantic Uintah Lake in the 
State of Cornucopia is a most interesting 
locality when its merits are once known. 
There is no end to the places and objects 
to be seen if some knowing person will 
clearly point them out. The Barnacles 
family will talk about these things well 
enough it somebody else starts the sub- 
ject but are the last people to ever think 
of making any matter of local interest 
known ; and you might as well look at any 
old and unremarkable building in any old 
and unremarkable town as to look at the 
most historic pile in Europe or elsewhere 
if you have not a guide book or other 
informant to awaken your imagination 
and interest by showing wherefore the 
historic pile is forever famous. So that 
is about the way that our little company 
got stirred up to an extent that they 
cared little for their meals, or at least 
were willing to forego a dinner or two for 
the sake ot an exploration, after the pa- 
pers began to drop in, which contained 
descriptions of "The Eyrie" and the 

g)ints of interest about Uintah Lake, 
ver there by the Barnacles point you 
may see in wmdy weather when all the 
rest ot the lake is either yellow or green 
through shallowness, there is an expanse 
of water that remains blue almost to black- 
ness; it is the unfathomable place, the 
well, the bottomless source of the waters 
of the lake which has an outlet like a mill- 
race but no other inlet, and as soon as 
that was known there was an early break- 
fast, the sailboats were brought into requi- 
sition and all went, if only to drop peb- 
bles and look into the depths and im- 
agine, but some went to heave thelead, 
and rinding no bottom ; went again next 
day, and others were led off to a sequest- 
ered bay tnat was covered with a magnif- 
icent species of water-lily. There is 
one remarkable hill on the lake shore 
called Crystal Cone; it is covered with 
pme and cedar and would not be ob- 
served without being pointed out, yet all 
the houses in this neighborhood have, as 
curiosities, some specimens of the bril- 
liant rock cr>'stais that are found there 
sometimes in large masses, and the Cone 
is full of diminutive welis that have been 
dug in search of them Among the ob- 
jects of sentimental interest the chief is 
the half-buiit and now decayed chateau 
which a cenain singular and melancholy 
German baron began to build in the 



wilderness and surrounded it with a 
maze or labyrinth through which no 
intruder could find the wav unless by 
chance, part of which still remains; a 
tortuous thicket of thorny bushes, and 
near by is the remains of the log house 
he lived and died in alone. The Barn- 
acles family firmly believe the place 
haunted and never go to that side of the 
lake at night, but thatof course is non- 
sense. Our people go in daytime to find 
some sort of a scarce flower that he 
planted here and there and as this is the 
season of its blossoming they sometimes 
bring home a few specimens and set in 
glasses on the breakfast table . 

When we had a house count of Ap, 
there were some disagreeable people who 
could not be expected to stay long any- 
where. One man and his wife made a 
specialty of deriding hotels and the enter- 
tainment and accommodations they of- 
fer. Said he had been trying his powers 
of endurance of all evils at the Hotel- 
de Villa-Franca at Cabbageadia, and 
made much sport of it. He did not seem 
to find fault with anything here and yet 
he made people feel uncomfortable and 
many were glad when he and his wife 
went away at the end of two days. Three 
or four of the young people besides went 
away Saturday evening, as this place is 
intolerably dull on Sundays. 

Ah, but here is worse sorrow; The 
house and the guests are to lose the Col- 
onel and the banker's wife and daughter 
to morrow morning. They have been 
the right sort of guests, evidently, for they 
seemed always m the lead for pleasure, 
iitu they have been reading the adver- 
tisements of other resorts very closely in 
their resting spells when the papers lie on 
the piazzas and in the reading room, and 
they have found a place that seems to 
suit their case better. So to morrow they 
go to the Rosedale house at Purple Lake 
(it is in the Cashmere Vale, and the 
nightingales sing round it all the day long 
— so the advertisements say) but they 

Eromise the company to come back again 
efore the season ends. 
That is early breakfast Monday mom- 
mg for the friends who will go to see 
them off, and at night comes off another 
birthday suppt^r — this time it is for the 
lady hostess and rnust be fine. I have a 
13-pound rich fruit cake made some days 
ago to be old enough to cut to morrow, 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



io6 



for fruit cakes of the richest sorts are not 
good until a week after baking. 

SSG—Kich Fruit Cake or Black Cake. 



This is the kind of cake or rather, one 
of the kinds that can be kept for years 
without detriment to the cake. Some 
caterers have had it mentioned among 
their specialties as "grooms cake, 3 years 
old" 

Prepare the fruit first : 

254 pounds raisins — 6 heaped cups, 

254 pounds currants — same. 

i}4 pounds citron shred fine — 4 cups. 

2 heai^ing tablespoons mixed ground 
spices — cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and 
mace. 

I small cup strong black xoffee. 

I Sail cup dark molasses. 

Same of brandy. 

A small addition of almonds, nuts or 
cut figs can be mixed in if wished, and 
a spoonful of lemon extract. 

Then mix the cake batter: 

14 ounces su^ar — 2 cups. 

14 ounces butter— same if pressed. 

10 eggs. 

18 ounces flour — 4 large cups. 

Mix up same as pound cake, the sugar 
and butter together first, then eggs 2 at a 
time, then flour. After the flour, put in 
the 2 ounces spices, coffee, molasses, 
brandy and lemon extract. The batter 
is quite thin, but no matter. Mix flour 
in the fruit to dust it well, then stir up 
all together. 

Take a mould that holds at least 6 qts. 
or two moulds of 4 quarts each, line them 
with greased paper, put in the cake and 
wrap other papers around the outside 
and tie on to guard the cake against too 
much heat in bakin;^. Bake from 2 to 3 
liours. The raisins ought to be stoned 
or; ii there is nobody to do that, cut them 
in two, but not mince them small, as that 
spoils the appearance of the cake. 

Cost of large fruit cake, about 15 cents 
a pound. 

Note. The above has been proven a 
valuable receipt about Christmas and par- 
tv times but as it makes a cake so nearly 
all fruit it will bear a little thinning down 
with moro cake batter for most occasions. 
I make twice the amount of pound-cake 
mixture, use a little of it as pound or jelly 
cake and put the specified amount of 



fruits in what remains or mix them with- 
out taking any out; it is a rich cake siiil, 
only of diffierent degrees ; and if they are 
temperance people and will not buy 
brandy put in another spoonfiil of spices

COOKING JFOR PROFIT. 



mushrooms and young onions, about ^ 
cup of each ; break 3 eggs in a pan, add 
a spoonful of milk or both and the 
minced ingredients, season, stir up, put 
in a buttered small pan or mould and 
cook by steaming. When the custard 
is done and cold cut out shapes ether 
like corks or plain squares, rut half a 
dozen in each plate when the consomme 
is served. 



838— Flounder a'la Italienne. 

The flounder is a flat fish about same 
size as the sole, common and quite cheap 
in the seap>orts. 

Cut in pieces across the fish and re- 
move the dark skin ; cook it the same as 
at No. 184. Serve with brown Italian 
sauce and a potato croquette in the 
same plate. 

839— Potato Croquettes. 



Take 4 or 5 potatoes out of the dinner 
steamer and mash them with salt, the 
yolk of an egg, or two, and pinch of 
ground mace or nutmeg and if quite dry 
add a httle butter. Roll on the flour 
board, cut ofl" balls larger than walnuts, 
roll round, bread them in eg? and 
cracker meal and fry to a handsome 
light brown same as dauphine. They 
can be made in other shapes but the 
round is the quickest. 



840— Braised Brisket of 
Marechale. 



Veal 



To braise or braze meat is to cook in 
a brazier or covered pot with live coals 
on top. It can be done nearly as well in 
deep baking pan in the oven if covered 
with buttered paper—which will^ stand a 
good deal of heat without burning and 
keeps the steam in the meat. Saw the 
breast of veal in strips across the ribs, 
put them in the pan with some soup 
stock, vegetables and garden herbs and 
salt and cook with the paper cover on in 
the oven for an hour and a half. Have 
it so that the liquor is dried down to 
glaze that sticks to the pan and to the 
meat. Tak^the meat out, pour off the 



fat and boil up some Spanish sauce in 
the pan, if you have it, if not use water; 
strain and use as gravy to the meat and 
serve browned potatoes in the same plate. 



841— Lamb Cutlets, a la Nelson. 



flavored 
with bread 



Cutlets spread with a highly 
mince in stifi" sauce, dredged wit 
crumbs and baked brown. 

Prepare the cutlets (chops) as for 
broiling, lay in a pan and bake half- 
done so that thev will retain their shape 
afterwards. 

Mince an ounce each of ham, mush- 
rooms, young onions, little barsiey and 
crush a clove of garlic ana mince it. 
with the rest. Take a spoonful each^ 
of flour and butter, stir them over the- 
fire and add water to make a sauce 
thick as paste; stir the minced ingre- 
dients in. Spread a teaspoonful oni 
each cutlet, round it over and cover 
with bread crumbs or cracker meal and 
brown them in th-j oven. Serve a spoon- 
ful of Allemande sauce in the disnand 
the cutlet in it and garnish with a strip 
of toast. 



842— Sause Allemande. 



Take chicken or veal broth boiled 
down rich and strained through a nap- 
kin and pour it to a roux of butter and 
flour made hot over the fire as if mak- 
ing butter sauce. 

When thin enough let it slowly boil 
at the side and skim off the butter that 
rises while the sauce is becoming thick- 
er by reduction. Shortly before it is 
wanted mix the yolk of an egg with it 
carefully, without curdling the yolk with 
too much heat, and add the juice of 
half a lemon. Allemande sauce is Ger- 
man sauce 



843— Rissolettes a la Marseillaise. 



Picked fish and cheese pounded to- 
gether, rolled up in pie paste and fried . 

Take cold wnitefisn or any other that 
is free from bones, and half as much 
cheese, mince, and then pound them to-- 
gether to a sort of paste and season with 
salt and pepper. 

Roll out a piece of good Die paste very

thin, cut out with a biscuiv cutter, make 
little turnovers or other shapes such as 
long rolls with a spoonful of the fish mix- 
ture inside and the edges of the paste 
wetted with egg to make them adhere. 
Drop the rissolettes into the same kettle 
of hot lard the potato croquettes are to 
be fried in. Take out while still light- 
colored and place on paper in a hot pan 
to absorb every particle of grease. Serve 
one or two to each dish with a green bor- 
der of fried parsley or a green puree, or 
chopped yolk of egg for ornament. Alar- 
seilles is a seaport and great place for fish 
dinners— hence the names. 



Use a large pan that the pudding m ay 
be shallow and cut out the better for it. 



844— Baked Tomatoes. 



If not intelligently managed, baked to- 
matoes are sure to be a failure through 
all dissolving into liquid. Without peel- 
ing, cut off a slice of the top and scoop 
out the inside with a teaspoon into a 
strainer that will let the surplus juice 
flow away. Chop the pulp, add bread 
crumbs on top and bake in a buttered 
pan. 



845— Queen Puddirg. 

This is known by half a dozen diflerent 
names — it looks well and is a favorite 
kind. It is a bread custard with jelly 
spread over the top after baking • and . 
meringue (frosting) upon that like alemon \ 
pie, 

I pressed-m quart bread crumbs — 4 
cups. 

4 cups milk. 

j^ cup butter, melted. 

5I cup sugar. 

4 yolks eggs. 

I cup fruit jelly. 

4 whites and J4 cup sugar for the frost- 
ing. 

Have the bread very finely minced, 
mix the first five ingredients together and 
bake until the bread custard thus made 
is set in the middle. Spread the jelly 
over the top_ and set in the oven again. 
Whip the whites firm enough to bear up 
an egg, add the sugar, spread it on top of 
the hot jelly and finish baking with the 
oven door partly open as too much heat 
spoils the meringue . Costs about 35 
<»nts,but b enough for thirty people.

Butter, bread, coffee, tea, sugar (43 
cents.) 

Total $5.97; 35 persons; 17 cents a 
plate. 

846— Potage a la Reine. 



Reine is the French word for queen, 
this would therefore be in English 
"Queen's Soup.'' 

It is a puree soup like the potato cream 
and puree of beans, but thickened, in- 
stead, with the paste or piuree of pounded 
chicken and rice. 

Take : 

3 quarts chicken broth. 

4 solid cups chicken meat. 
I heaped cup boiled rice. 

I quart cream or good milk. 

Procure 4 cupfuls of clear chicken meat 
tender enough to mash to a paste, either 
from two or three young chickens roasted, 
or I large fowl boiled. Mince it fine, 
pound It smooth, add the rice while 
pounding, pour in some of the broth to, 
moisten it, then rub it through a perfor- 



lOQ 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



ated tin gravy strainer or a sieve. 

The chicken (or veal) broth should have 
a small bunch of parsley, i stalk of cel- 
ery, a small piece of onion and piece of 
broken nutmeg boiled in it, and if ob- 
tainable a sprig of green thyme, and af- 
ter that be strained. Mix it boiling hot 
with the puree of chicken and rice ; set 
on bricks or at the back of the stove to 
keep hot without boiling, and boil the 
cream separately and pour it ir> at last. 
Serve with soufiiee crouton. No. 736. 

Another way is to make a cream of 
rice with chicken meat in it cut small, 
and no croutons. 



847— Fillets of Redfnh a la Chambord 
Individua!. 

Thin fillets spread with a paste or force- 
meat containing lobster, rolled up and 
baked and served with a lobster sauce . 

Chambon is the name of a part of 
France on the sea coast and also a count's 
title. The redfish is from the Florida 
coast where it is also called red grouper . 

Slice the fish lengthwise into fillets thin 
and broad like fillets of sole and as small 
as possible, pound a quarter can of lob- 
ster to a paste, add as much panada 
(soaked and squeezed bread) season it, 
add a raw yolk. Spread the fillets with 
the mixture thinly, roll them np, and lay 
in a pan and bake with butter and water 
just enough to keep them moist, and 
baste twice. They will cook in about 30 
minutes . 

Pound the reddest pieces of lobster 
meat and rub it through a sieve, mix it 
with a little good butter sauce ; slice in 3 
or 4 mushrooms and as many shrimps, 
if at hand, or a tew pieces of lobster cut 
in dire and season with pepper and lemon 
juice. Serve a fillet to each plate with 
sauce and some special form of potato 
in the same. 



848— Potatoes a la Monac^f. 

Cut cores out of raw potatoes with an 
apple corer or column cutter, and slice 
them into thick lozenge shapes like gun- 
wads. Boil first, then fry in a kettle of 
lard. Before serving, shake them about 
in a pan with a lump of butter, dredge 
with salt and fine minced parsley. Serve 
with fish . Monaco is the name of a ger- 



man resort, a sort of Saratoga. 
849— Mutton a la Bretonne. 

Mutton and beans. The French 
equivalent for our pork and beans. The 
frequency of the sign in the windows of 
French restaurants seems to indicate that 
it is in demand at least for a lunch dish. 

Take a shoulder of mutton and remove 
the bone by cutting close, laying out the 
meat like a thick steak. To season it 
mince one onion and crush a clove of 
garlic with the side of your knife and 
mix it in and stew over the meat, dredge 
thyme or sage, salt and pepper, roll up 
and tie and then braise the meat in 
a covered pan with broth or water at first, 
allowing it to dry down and brown like a 
roast at last. 

Boil two cups of white beans in the 
usual way while the mutton is braising. 
Take the mutton out of the saucejDan 
and cook a little minced ham and onion 
in the gravy that remains, then put in the 
cookedT beans and shake up. 

Serve beans in the dish with a cut of 
the roll of mutton on top. 



850— Chicken Pie, American Style. 

When you make chicken pie cut down 
the quantities of all other meats and 
cut down the vegetables and leave out 
the third entree altogether that there may 
be afforded enough of this and without 
haying to serve the roughest pieces of 
chicken . It is one of the favorite dishes 
alike in the largest hotels and the small- 
est and it is poor policy to make it a dis- 
appointment in either place. Let there 
be a surplus of the liquor the chicken is 
stfjwed in left over to pour into the pie as 
it dries down while dinner is going on, 
for the cry is " still they come*' — no, not 
that but "plenty of gravy and more of 
the crusl." 

, A large chicken can be cut or chopped 
into 18 pieces for stew or pie but such 
pieces are not able to make you any rep- 
utation. If the back bones and necks 
are left out to be used in soup or other 
ways it may take another chicken to make 
the Die large enough but after all you will 
not have to work so hard to find a piece 

I of the breast for the few fastidious people 

I who can't eat anything else. 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



no 



Cut up five chickens making 6 choice 
cuts of each without counting the back 
or neck ; allow about ^ pound salt pork 
cut in stiips, a heaped 'tablespoon 
minced onion, same of salt, a teaspoon of 
white pepper, some chopped parsley, 
flour to thicken the liquor and about 3 
pounds short pie crust. 

Boil the chickens in water enough to 
cover, time according to age; voung 
chicken's less than J^ hour; old fowls 3 
hours; with the seasoning of salt, pork 
and onions. Thicken the liquor, add 
parsley, dip the chicken into a baking pan 
dredge over with pepper and flour and 
cover with a thin pie crust. Bake ^ 
hour. Cut in squares. 

'I'here should not be gravy enough in 
the pan to drown the crust before it can 
bake— the gravy can be poured in after- 
wards. Baking powder crust can be made 
good with care but seldom is, for it rises 
too thick and absorbs all the sauce. A 
short paste is better. 



851— Birds Nest Pudding. 

An egg batter pudding with apples. 
Probably gets its name from its appear- 
ance when baked in round pan. 

1 large cup flour— 5 ounces. 
3 cups milk — I ^ pints. 

2 heaped tablespoons sugar. 
Butter size of an egg. 

3 eggs. Little salt. 

Apples enough for a 4 quart pan. 

Sugar, butter and cmnamon or nut- 
meg for the apples. 

Pare and core the apples— enough to 
cover the pan bottom ; fill core holes with 
sugar and some butter, water to barely 
wet the pan, cover with greased paper 
and bake until done and the syrup dned 
down. Mix the batter smoothly, as if for 
batter cakes, pour it over the apples and 
bake about }4 hour more . Pure cream 
sweetened is a good sauce, any other 
will answer if cream is not to be hid. 

852— Lemon Pie Meringued. 

Rule : One lemon and two eggs to each 
pie. 

1 cup sugar. 

2 cups water or milk. 
2 lemons or 3 if small. 



% cup flour. 

6 yolks of eggs . 

Put the su^ar in a saucepan and grate 
lemon rinds into it, squeeze the juice, 
add the pint of water and boil. Mix the 
2 ounces flour with water and thicken the 
boiling syrup . 1 ake it ofi" and pour it 
gradually to the beaten yolks. Fill 
three pies and bake. 

Whip the 6 whites, add 6 tablespoons 
sugar, spread over the pies while they are 
still hot in the oven and bake light -col- 
ored, A richer appearance may be given 
by dredging granulated sugar over the 
frosting before baking ; it makes a crust . 
Too much baking will spoil the frosting, 
causing it to fall ; also, be caretul to get 
about a tablespoon of sugar to each 
white of an egg. 



853— 6a-antin3 en Bellev-e 



A galantine (not gelatine as it often 
mistakenly appears in printed bills) is a 
boned fowl or bird of any sort ; it is en 
bellevue when it is encased in jelly and 
ornamented. Galantines are maae the 
same of either chickens or turkeys, ac- 
cording to the following directions. 

Singe and pick over a young turkey or 
pullet, and without otherwise opening it, 
cut the skin along the whole length of the 
back and with the point of a sharp knife 
go on cuttini< the meat from the bone on 
both sides until the hip joints and wings 
are reached. Chop through these with 
the hea\-y end of a carving knife and con- 
tinue cutting close to the breast bone un- 
til the frame is entirely removed without 
the skin being cut through. 

After that, bone the legs and wings 
half way and chop off" the rest. The 
meat of the legs and wings is to be 
tucked into the body, which, when done 
up, will be a smooth cushion shape . 

Then wash the turkey in cold water and 
dry it on a cloth. Spread it out with the 
skin side down on the table and cover 
with the forcemeat ; draw the two sides 
together, sew with twine, put it into a 
pudding cloth previously buttered and tie 
and pin it securely. Boil the turkey in 
salted broth or water containing the 
bones and any other trimmings left from 
the forcemeat besides, for from two to 
three hours, according to size. 

When the boned and stufled turkey or 
chicKen has been sufliciently boiled, press 



lit 



COOKING JFOR PROFIT. 



It, still in the cloth, into a pan or mold, 
and there let it remain with a weight on 
top until cold. Into whatever shape it 
may be, there should be another vessel a 
size larger precisely like it, and the boned 
turkey or chicken, being taken out of the 
first mold, and the cloth taken off and the 
surface wiped clean with a napkin dipped 
in hot water, is then to be placed in the 
larger one; the space is then filled up 
with aspic jelly, poured in nearly cold, 
and when set, the mold being dipped a 
few moments in warm water, the galan- 
tine can be tu.ned out onto its dish and 
decorated. 

The way to get a coating of jelly all 
over the galantine is to stamp out star 
shapes from thick slices of white turnip 
or other material and lay th«m on the 
bottom of the larger mould. They hold 
up the galantine from the bottom for the 
jelly to run under, and show up as orna- 
ments. 

Decorate with blocks of colored jelly 
set around and upon it, and with orna- 
mental silver skewers, with lemons cut 
like baskets, and with flowers. 

Two fair-sized turkeys, prepared as 
above, either stuffed with forcemeat or 
with the meat of another turkey or chick- 
en, 7,'ill slice into fifty plates. 



854— Stuff j..g for Gilantines. 

Where boned turkey and chicken is 
served so frequently fo^ lunch that it is 
no rarity, the easiest ana quickest way of 
stufifin;^ may perhaps be as good as the 
best; a boned tutkey then becomes a 
fraud, if considered as turkey while it 
may be very good if regarded as sausage, 
for tnc most available material is a com- 
mon sausage meat to fill up the space 
formerly occupied by the frame of the 
fowl. Next to that and perhaps the oft- 
enesc used is a mixture of selected lean 
veal and fat salt pork minced into a sort 
of veal sausage, well seasoned and 
served up in the turkey. That can be 
made by any person without special di- 
recLions. 

Another and better way is to bone two 
turkeys or a turkey and chicken and put 
the two in one, being careful to have 
the inside chicken or small turkey quice 
young and tender. Sea. on well without 
cutting or mincing, lay one on the other. 



place a few strips of fat pork about as 
thick as a pencil, lengthwise, and half 
a dozen hard-boiled yolks, gather up and 
sew in shapje. When cooked, pressed 
and sliced this will be all turkey or chick- 
en and better liked than the sausage busi- 
ness. 

For something more elaborate for a 
little party supper or lunch the following 
may be relied upon to make a nice dish, 
worth ornamenting. 

855— Forcemeat far Boned Turkey 
and Ccicken 



The quantity of this receipt is sufficient 
for one medium-sized turkev that will 
slice into twenty-five individual dishes. 
For a large chicken the amounts may ba 
one-half. This makes about four pounds 
of choice meat, in addition to the turkey. 

2 hens, boiled tender. 

6 ounces fat salt pork — a cup. 

6 ounces butter — a cup. 

6 ounces white bread crumbs — 2 cups. 

2 raw eggs. 

8 hard boi'ed eggs. 

I cup broth or water. 

I lemon. 

Nutmeg or thyme. 

Salt and pepper. 

Take the dark meat of the fowls, cut it 
in very small dice and keep it separate . 
Take off the white meat, chop fine and 
then pound to .a soft paste. Throw in 
the fat pork minced, the seasonings and 
the bread crumbs and mix together, and 
soften the butter and stir in. Mix the 
two raw eggs with the cup of broth, add 
juice of lemon, and with this mixture 
moisten the forcemeat. It is now ready 
for use. 

Strew over the turkey about half the dark 
meat mince, and over that spread half the 
white forcemeat. Cut the yolks of the 
hard boiled eggs in quarters and scatter 
some over the layer of forcemeat, then 
the rest of the minced dark meat, the re- 
maining forcemeat and eg^ yolks. Do 
up the boned turkey thus filled as above 
directed. 

When sliced cold the above shows little 
dark squares set in a white meat, all 
spotted through with the yellow egg 
yolks.

butter 8, eggs 13, bread, lemon and sea- 
sonings 4; 80 cents. 

856— Cost of Ga antine of Turkey cr 
Chicken. 

Twenty cents a pound for material is 
the lowest that boned turkey and chick- 
en can be expected to cost, and if prices 
rule high the cost may be sometimes 
twice that sum. A 14 pound turkey 
(plucked but not drawn) may be dressed 
boned and then done up with 6 pounds 
of raw veal forcemeat or sausage meat 
inside and after cooking and pressing it 
will scarcely weigh 10 pounds altogether 
—a loss ot over half; so that if the tur- 
key be bought at 125^ the galantine will 
cost 25 cents a pound at the lowest; and 
we find that our chicken galantine con- 
taining one-half the amount of force- 
meat, (No. 855) and a 1% pound fowl 
bought at 10 cents a pound, making a 
total of 75 cents, weighs but 3^ pounds 
at last and has therefore cost over 21 
cents a pound for material. The great- 
est shrinkage takes place in the boiling. 

Such is th« calculation to be made 
when contracting for a party. 

On the other hand it isto be considered 
the galantine is subject to no further 
depreciation In our 31^ pounds are 56 
ounces ; about 2 ounces make as large a 
slice us anybody wants, being about 25 
plates for 75 cents, or 3 or 4 cents a per- I 
son. The aspic jelly makes a separate ' 
calculation ; it is not essential, but to be ' 
charged to ornamentation . It is, how- 
ever cheaper by the pound than the meat 
and at a large party may be converted to 
profit by an expert carver. 



857— ohicken Salad. 



The same as No . 150. Make up the 
form in a round salad bowl, place a heart 
lettuce on top, and quarters of eggs in 
close order around the base. 



858 -Art in cutti ^g Eggs. 

Hold the hard-boiled egg in a napkin 
in your hollowed hand while you cut it 
in quarters lengthwise, and avoid break- 
ing the yolks and spoiling the eggs for 



ornamental purposes. Eggs are turned 
blue and made to look as if bad by too 
long boiling ; when they are fairly hard- 
boiled put them immediately in cold wa^ 
ter and there will be no discoloration. 



859— Art in Mincing Parsley. 

Chop parsley very fine, inclose it in a 
clean towel and wring by twisting it until 
all the juice is expressed. The parsley 
is then a green dust which when scattered 
upon a dish will not fall all in one spot 
but will divide as easily as grains of col- 
ored sugar. For salad ornamentation 
dip round slices of lemon in the green 
parsley dust and border the dish.

860 Pan de Foies-Gras. 



It means loaf or cake of poultry livers, 
and is of course, a high-flavored dish of 
which a small quantity sufnces, to be eat- 
en with thin sliced bread as potted tongue 
or ham would be. Pain is the French 
word for bread or loaf and seems to be 
used in the same sense as Nve use the 
word cheese in head-cheese, liver-cheese 
and the like. In other words this is a 
form of liver paste, or pate-de-foie-gras, 
turned out of its mould and incased in 
jelly by the same method as for boned 
chicken. Take the ingredients in two 
parts and it does not seem so formidable. 

y^ pound chicken livers. 

6 ounces fat hen or salt pork. 

2 ounces lean cooked ham. 

14 cup sherry. 

I bayieaf, pepper, little mixed ground 
spices, salt. 



6 ounces panada (bread soaked and 
squeezed dry.) 

2 raw e.^gs. 

4 hard boiled yolks. 

Yz a corned tongue cooked. 

Some chopped mushrooms and aspic 
jelly. 

Steep the livers in water to whiten them. 
If the poultry livers are short weight use 
call's liver to make the amount. Set all 
the ingredients of the first part to sim- 
mer in a saucepan with a lid on the back 
part of the range and let remain till a con- 
venient time, 2 or 3 hours. Then mash to 
paste. The livers should be nearly dry in 
the saucepan but not fried or browned. 
Mix the raw egc^s with the panada and 
these with the pounded liver and press 
through a seive. Cut up the tongue, 
yolks and few mushrooms and mix them 
in the liver paste. 

lake a pan or mould that holds over 



3 pints and cover the bottom with very 
thin slices of fat salt pork, press in the 
liver paste, put on top a bay leaf and 
slice or two of pork and a buttered pa- 
per over that . Set the mould in a pan 
of water in the oven and bake about 
an hour. Turn it out of the pan or 
mould when cold, remove the fat and 
it is ready for use, but if to be set on 
the table whole, proceed as for a galan- 
tine of chicken and encase it in aspic 
jelly. 

Cost of material [about 45 cents for 
2^ pounds or about the same as boned 
chicken. 

861— Charlotte Ku:se—Tr.ree Ways. 

It is an outside casing of cake filled 
with a thick cream, which ought to be 
real craam thick enough to whip to froth ; 
if such cannot be had, a thin cream can 
be made firm by adding gelatine to it ; 
and if no cream at all then make the 
same thing of milk and whip it up light 
as explained at No. 865. 

There are many ways of putting up a 
charlotu . 

1. Procure 3 or 4 dozon lady fingexs 
(No. 4) and a tin shape, which is nothing 
more than a hoop of tin with straight-up 
sides^ like a three pint milk cup would 
be without a bottom. It may be either 
round or oval according to the dish to be 
used to set the charlotte on the table. 
Cut ihe edges of the lady-fingers straight, 
wet them with white of egg and line the 
shape with them set upright and the 
shape being on the dish. Whip the 
cream to firm froth, sweetening and fla- 
voring at the same time ; fill up the shape 
with iL and let it remain in a cold place 
till wanted, then carefully lift off the tin 
shape and the cream will keep the form 
together if it was double cream at the start 
— ttiat is cream that has stood on the 
milk two days before skimming. 

If not sure of the cream being firm 
enough, then add gelatine according to 
directions for Bavarian cream. 

There is no covering of cake in this, 
but the surface of the cream may be or- 
namented with some of the same cream 
in a cornet or ornamenting tube the 
same as if it were icing. 

2. When a shorter way must be 
adopted bake a good sponge cake in a 
round mould. No. 281 is as good as any 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S

with a liberal allowance of powder. Then 
cut out the inside to use as cake and take 
the shell or crust to fill with whipped 
cream. If the cake is evenly baked of 
light color this way does very \vell; and 
where the charlotte is to be sliced and 
served individually, as in most hotels, 
the long and narrow moulds such as 
loaves of bread are baked in may be 
found most suitable, as the charlotte can 
then be cut across. 

3. Another way to be adopted when 
the charlotte-russe is to be set on the ta- 
ble whole, as for a party supper, is to 
take a deep, plain mould or a tin pan, 
cover the bottom with the thinnest sliced 
sponge cake or lady-fingers and line the 
sides with the same, fill with cream stif- 
fened with gelatine, keep cold and when 
set, turn it out of the mould bringing the 
bottom on top and ornament that either 
with whipped cream piled up and spotted 
with strawberries or else with only a coat 
of icing and a border. Cream stiffened 
with gelatine is called Bavarian cream — 
see receipts below. 



862— Individual Charlotte-Russe, 
Ways. 



Six 



1. It is best to make individual char- 
lottes where the time allows, for hotel din- 
ners or parties. In some places paper 
cases can be bought and the charlottes 
made and served in them. Make the 
same mixture as for sponge roll, very 
thin, and cut in bands and pieces that 
will fit inside; then fill with whipped 
cream. Some of the largest hotels serve 
them in these paper cases always. 

2. If you have no ready-made cases 
you can make some of white unruled pa- 
per, cutting the first piece to fit inside 
a small tumbler, and then using it for a 
pattern to cut the others by. Paste them 
together, put in a bottom and fringe the 
edges. Line with lady-fingers made 
small and cut to fit; fill with whipped 
cream and serve them in the cases. 

3. bmall sponge cakes can be baked in 
the deep muttin pans or gem pans — they 
are tumbler-shaped — the inside cut out 
to be made into pudding, and the shells 
filled wiih cream, and sent in without a 
paper case. 

4. Another way and a good one is to 
cut sponge-roll sheets into pieces that will 



just line the inside of deep mufl5n rings of 
the sort that have no bottom. Fill them 
with cream stiffened with gelatine and 
set on ice, and when cold and finn slip 
them out of the rings, and serve with a 
fine strawberr}' on top or ornament with 
pink spots of meringue. 

5-6. A good deal of variety can be 
had with this form of charlotte as, some- 
times, white sponge cake can be made and 
filled with yellow Roman cream (No 
194) or with chocolate or coffee cream, 
ana another time the ordinary yellow 
sponge cake lining can be filled with 
white cream, oi; strawberry cream, etc. 



863— About Whipped Cream. 



Good thick cream, if cold, can be made 
firm enough by beating with a wire egg 
whisk to fill charlottes, or even plates 
lined with a thin sheet of cake, or to 
spread over a cream pie without the addi- 
tion of gelatine or anything else, and 
once so whipped to firmness it will not 
go d9wn again as long as it is kept cold — 
provided, however, that there is not 
much sugar mixed with it. A half-pint 
cup of good cream will increase in vol- 
ume, when beaten sufficiently, to fill 
about eight of the small charlotte cases 
previously mentioned. 



864— Bavarian Cream— Best. 



But whipped cream as stated in the 
foregoing not being capable of carrying 
much sugar or flavoring, a little gelatine 
has to be added to give it substance. 
Half an ounce to a quart is sufficient un- 
less there is to be an addition of some 
flavoring cordial or fruit juice, when an 
ounce to a quart will be the rule, and 
four to six ounces of sugar. No boiling 
is required, but set the gelatine in half a 
cup of milk or cream on the shelf of the 
range where it will gradual Iv get hot. 
When it is dissolved, place the cream in 
a deep pan set in ice water and pour in 
the dissolved gelatine while beating. The 
cream can then be put into molds, very 
slightly oiled, and left to become firm, or 
used to fill cases lined with cake for 
charlottes. 

Cost : I qt cream 20, ^ ounce gelatine 
6, sugar 3, flavoring ^ ; 34 cents. Makes 
2 qts when whipped light ; about 18 cents

COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



for each quart mould. 



865— Bavarian Cream— Substitute. 



This is, in effect, blanc-mange whipped 
up light while cooling, with the aid of 
white of eggs, so that when perfectly cold 
it can be sliced and shows the same 
spongy texture as fine bread. It is good 
to fill charlottes when pure cream cannot 
be obtained, and good for dessert in 
place of ice cream. 

4 cups good rich milk — a quart. 

I small cup sugar— 6 ounces. 

I ounce gelatine — nearly a package of 
the shred kind, or 2 or -? sheets. 

3 whites of eggs . 

V anil. a flavormg. 

Set the milk over the fire with the 
sugar and gelatine in it and stir it until 
the gelatine is all dissolved. Better not 
let It quite boil because sometimes milt is 
curdled by the gelatine at boiling point ; 
strain it into a pan set in ice water, and 
when nearly cold beat it up light. Whip 
the three whites quite firm, and stir in 
and continue the beating until the cream 
has become nearly solid, then pour it 
into moulds or into the charlotte-russe 
case, which may have been prepared 
previously. The flavoring extract can 
be added while beating. A little salt 
mixed in the ice water makes it colder 
and hastens the setting of the cream. 

Cost : milk 5, gelatine i oz lo, sugar 3, 
flavoring 4, whites 3; 25 cents for 2 
quarts. 



866— Maraschino Cream 



For filling charlotte-rnsse or serving 
instead of ice cream : 

2^ pints thin cream. 

I teacup maraschino. 

7 ounces sugar. 

1 package of gelatine — i ^ ounces. 

Put the extia half pint of cream in a 
sm.ill saucepan, and the gelatine and 
sugar with it, set over the fire and beat 
with the wire egg whisk till the gelatine 
is all dissolved — the quicker the better. 
Pour the maraschino into the cold cream, 
then strain in the C9ntents of the sauce- 
pan, set the whole in a pan of ice water, 
and whip the cream mixture until it be- 
gins to set, when pour it into the pre- 



pared mould. 

Maraschino is a cordial that gives a 
pleasant flavor to creams and jellies. It 
IS kept in all first-class bars. Comes in 
flasks bound in basket work. Is made by 
steeping the kernels of an Italian cherry 
in spirits of wine and then adding syrup. 

867— Orange Cake. 

White cake layers with orange icing 
(frosting). Make the best white cake. 
No. 622, and bake on jelly-cake pans. 
Grate the rinds of 2 or 3 oranges into 2 
large cups powdered sugar. Take 3 
whites of eggs in a bowl, put the flavored 
sugar in, and beat with a wooden paddle 
until you have a pale yellow icing firm 
enough not to lun ofl'the cake. Spread 
some between the layers and the rest /aver 
the top and sides.

Bread, butter, coffee, tea, sugar (40 
cents.) 

Total $5 78; 35 persons, 16 J^ cents a 
plate. 

868— Consomme Printanier Royal 

It is consomme royal. No. 139, with a 
jardinier mixture of vegetables in it — or 
consomme jardiniere with custards in it, 
whichever way you may choose to regard 
it. Make the consomme good with roast 
chicken, plenty of beef, or meat extract; 
cut the vegetables as small as peas, with 
a jardinier cutter if you have one at hand, 
otherwise in very small dice, and have 
fresh green peas and asparagus points alio 
if in season. 



869— Tcmato Salad. 



Take bmall tomatoes not ripe enough 
to be soft, pare them with a very sharp 
knife without scalding. Cut in quarters, 
then in slices, put in a bowl with oil, vin- 
egar, pepper, salt; same as plain potato 
salad, shake up, serve with border of 
small lettuce leaves. 



870— Fillets cf Sheephead, a la Horly. 

Strips of fish fried in batter, served with 
Julienne potatoes and crisp fried onions. 
I'he sheephead is one of the best of the 
Southern sea fishes ; in shape and quality 
it is very much like the black bass, and is 
generally reserved for boiling. It is so 
named for its projecting front teeth. To 
cook it a la Horly, cut it in strips size of 
a finger, salt well, pepper a little. Make 
a good frying batter with 2 eggs to a quart 
offlour, little melted butter or oil, and 
milk enough to make like thin batter-cake 
mixture. Dip the pieces of fish, drop in 
hot lard, fry slow enough to let get well 
done, but of light color. 

Slice 2 or 3 onions in rings, flour them 
and fry yellow and dry, also fry a few 
handfuls of Julienne potatoes. Serve a 
little of each at the side of the fillet in 
the same dish. 

There was a duke de Horly, prominent 
in the wars of the last century. 

871— Ro lade of Veal, a I? Napolitaine. 

Napolitaine is but another w^ of say- 



ing Italian style; it means with macaroni 
when it is not with Neapolitan or horse- 
radish sauce. Roll up a shoulder of veal 
after taking out the bone, and braise or 
roast it covered with buttered jDaper. 
Cook a dozen sticks of macaroni, cut 
short, put in light gravy or Spanish sauce 
and serve in the dish with a slice of veal 
on top. 

Napolitaine is the French spelling; 
Neapolitan is the English; it means ot 
the city of Naples in Italy. 

872— Cutlets of Minced Chicken, Bor- 
deiaise. 



2 solid cups chicken meat, or, equal to 
the meat of one fowl. 
I cup panada. 
^ cup butter. 

1 tablespoon minced onion. 

2 tablespoons minced mushrooms. 
2 eggs. 

Thyme, parsley, pepper, salt. 

Pick the chicken meat to pieces and 
mince it; there should be over a pound. 
Make panada by soakmg white bread in 
cold water and squeezing dry. Put the 
butter in a frying-pan along with the on- 
ions and mushrooms, and stir over the 
fire a few minutes, then put in the i.anada 
and when hot add the eggs and after that 
the chicken and seasonings. 

Let get cold in a pan, then make up 
with floured hands, first in pear shapes, 
small size and flatten them to look like 
lamb chops. Get a piece of macaroni 
for each one and insert it to look like the 
bone. Dip in egg and cracker dust and 
fry in lard or oil. Serve with Borde- 
laise sauce in the dish and for ornament 
take a small crouton of fried bread, cut 
heart shaped, dip in tomato sauce, sprin- 
kle with parsley dust and set in the end 
of the dish. 



873— Croustades of Chicken Livers. 



The livers of poultry and game being 
high-flavored should be set apart for spe- 
cial uses instead of being stewed promis- 
cuously with the chicken, or pot-pies to 
which they give a taste that may not be 
to the general liking. In some of the 
most elaborate ragouts of the French or-« 
der, these livers are used in equal parts

with truffles, mushrooms and wine as spe- I the crust made short and the pies or tarts 
cial flavorings . A simple brown stew of * ' ' 
chicken livers in meat gravy makes a good 
dish served in cases made as directed in 



the next article. 



baked to dryness in a slack oven. 
877~T(0uble in Planning Dinners 



B74--Potato b hells or Croustades. 

Make the same mashed potato prepa- 
ration as for croquettes with one or two 
yolks in it, take it on the pastry board with 
a little flour, make a loncj roll of it, cut 
off slices like common biscuits in size, 
dip them in egg and cracker dust t\vice 
over, giving them a double coating. 
Then take a small cutter and mark a lid 
in each one as you would in a puff-paste 
tartlet. Put them in the frj'ing basket to 
fry, and only keep them in the hot lard a 
short lime lest they burst out of shape. 
When of a good, yellow -brown color 
take up, lift out the lid with a teaspoon 
pomt and scoop out the inside, making a 
crisp shell of potato to be filled with any 
kind cf savory ragout or mince. After 
maki g the round shape once, oval and 
diamond and boat shapes can be made 
as well. It is work that consumes a good 
deal of time — not adapted for crowded 
houses. 



875— Apricots a la Colbert 



Half an apricot or peach placed 
against a like amount of rice croquette 
mixture, egged and breaded in the form 
of a ball, and fried in a kettle of lard. 
When done, light-colored, rolled in suzar 
and served with sauce in the dish, made 
of the apricot syrup. Make rice croquette 
preparation as at No. iS8, or light potato 
croquette with a little sugar added. 
Some of the canned apricots are firm 
enough to use for this purpose. Drain 
them well from the juice. 



876— Preserved Tomato Tarts or 
Fies. 

When there are fresh tomatoes around, 
perhaps already peeled and nototherwise 
needed il is easy to put them in a pan 
with a cup of sugar and piece of bruised 
^in'jccr and let slowly stew down to pre- 
<>crvcs. Make small open pies of them^ 



The last dinner was not well planned ; 
there were good things in plenty but they 
ought not to have met in the same bill of 
fare; there were too many fries; came 
near being all fried; the fish in batter 
with potatoes and onions fried, chicken 
cutlets breaded and fried, croustades the 
same, croutons too, and then apricots a 
la Colbert. It was a mistake to have it 
so, and such mistakes are being made 
wherever bills of fare are written continu- 
ally. W^hen we see a bill of fare in print 
in a newspaper, it generally is a model 
one or tries to be so ; but models there 
are few or none in actual practice. The 
cook does not intend to get several dishes 
of the same nature or appearance in the 
same dinner and generally does not know 
it till it is too late to make a change ; 
perhaps his time for reflection was short 
or he was thinking about the butcher^s 
bill, or had found one thing he intended to 
use was spoiled, and an unsuitable sub- 
stitute was put in hastily. While one bill 
may be all fries, perhaps another time it 
will be all cream — cream soup, fish with 
cream sauce, macaroni a la Bechamel, 
onions in cream, fried cream fritters, 
cream cakes and ice cream — for if there 
is a pastry cook he is sure to be lucky 
enough to come in with his contribution 
of creams at the same time. Another 
day the dinner will be all dough, with 
nudel soup, fish in batter, meat pie ris- 
soles or kromeskies, fritters of some kind 
or pancakes and a batter pudding, or 
fruit cobbler. Still again there may be a 
surfeit of oysters; oysters raw, oyster 
soup, fish with oyster sauce, oyster stuff- 
ing in the turkey and oyster patties. So 
it goes about planning a dinner. One of 
Thackeray's novels has a French chefior 
a character, who goes oft" and plays the 
piano while composing his bill of fare and 
seems ludicrous to the reader but there is 
nothing extravagant about that. Most 
cooks make up the bulk of the bill of fare 
for to-morrow whilst carving or dishing 
up their entrees to-day when their 
thoughts are upon the subject; but some 
must 1:0 off and smoke or sit alone, and 
the^e is no reason why a piano or a banjo 
might not come in useful at such a time

uS 



and help to prevent the bad arrangement 
which makes a dinner be all cream or all 
dough, or of any one thing more than its 
due proportion. And we have not 
touched the still higher consideration of 
how some dinners are all heaviness and 
indigestibility, beginning with a heavy 
soup and stuffed fish running on through 
dishes that allow no relief by contrast to 
plum pudding, mince pie and tutti frutti ; 
while others are as uniformly thin and 
meagre, going from weak consomme 
through water, and more water to a 
finale of lemon water ice. If a piano will 
help theproper planning of a diiiner, ev- 
ery house ought to have one. ^

Milk, cream, buttermilk (38 cents.) 

Coffee, tea, bread, butter {24 cents.) 

Total $4.46; 32 persons, 14 cents a 
plate. 



878— Mul igataw y a la Manhattan. 

Mulligatawny soup is alwavs a curry 
soup although it may be changed in 
other respects. This remark is prompted 



by the mistake some cooks are making 
of giving the name to a soup made of to- 
matoes and vegetables without curry- 
powder. Mulligatawny is from two East 
Indian words. 

The soup abpve named is a chicken 
and rice soup^ with enough curry powder 
mixed in to give a pale yellow color. It 
is light and simple. Boil the fowl in the 
stock , take out and cut it in dice. Strain 
the stock, put in vegetables cut in dice 
and the chicken and little rice, curry, 
seasonings and small amount of starch 
thickening. 

879 -Sheephead a la Dieppoise. 



Fillets of fish placed in a deep baking 
pan, a matelotte (or fish stew) poured over, 
cracker crumbs on tojD and baked. Di- 
eppe is a seaport and fishing town. Cut 
the sheephead or other fish in two-ounce 
strips, free from bones. A'lince an onion 
fine. Butter the baking pan. strew the 
onion in and fill with the nsh. 

For the matelotte make white sauce 
about 3 cups, and put into it shrimps, 
oysters and button mushrooms, about J4 
cup of each, or if oysters are out of sea- 
son, use lobster or crab substitutes, pour 
over the fish in the pan, bake as above 
stated. Dish up with some ot the sauce, 
and serve potatoes in the same plate. 



880— Potatoes Serpeil-ne. 



There is an instrument like an auger 
made for the special purpose of boring 
out potatoes in corkscrew shapes. When 
it has passed through a potato you have 
two spirals of the size and appearance of 
strands of untwisted rope. Fry light 
colored in hot lard. Serve with fish and 
entrees. 



881— Beef a la Mode Parissienne. 

A piece of beef larded with salt pork 
only, braised tender, garnished^ in the 
dish with larse cuts of vegetables in fancy 
forms, and very green peas, and a crou- 
ton. Braise the beef as usual. Prepare 
an assortment of bri<;ht-colorod vegeta- 
bles — carrots, turnips, parsnips, anything 
that may be at hand, and cut them in 
shapes like a section of an oran e, and 
some like bottle corks ; and for the roun<l

ones pick out small onions, size of mar- 
bles, and fry them till thty are lightly 
browned, in a frying pan. Boil the vege- 
tables, then put them and the onions in 
brown sauce ; strain in the braised beef 
gravy and add little wine. Have a bowl 
of small peas, very green, either garden 
or Frcncn canned. Slice the a la mode 
beef, place mixed vegetables in gravy 
around it, spoonful of peas on top and a 
crouton dipped in sauce at one end. 



882~V6al Pie, a la \ ermier 



Femiier is French for farmer ; a la mode 
fermiere means country style. Make a 
good veal stew with milk in it as directed 
for veal pot pie, cover with short pie 
crust and bake. 



883--Cullets cf Sweetbreads, a la 
Victoria. 



Croquette mixture of sweetbreads made 
in cutlet shapes. 

There are two principal ways of pre- 
paring; croquettes, either with panada as 
for the chicken cutlets of the last dinner 
or with roux of butter and flour, which is 
richer. Preparj the roux and the sauce 
made of it by putting a cup oi flour and 
large Y2 cup butter into a irying pan and 
stir over the fire until they bubble, hen 
add 2 cups broth, allowing it to boil with 
constant stirring; this makes sauce of 
double thickness. Put in a pound or 
more of minced sweetbreads previously 
boiled, and 2 raw eggs. Stir till well 
cooked, add little nutmeg, salt, pepper, 
lemon juice, and then cool it in a pan. 
Make out in shape of mutton chops, 
stick a length of macaroni to imitate the 
bone, dip in ecg and cracker dust, and 
fry in hot lard. Serve with Allemande 
sauce in the dish and garniture of crou- 
tons, fancy potatoes or quenelles. 



884— Baked Indian Pudding— Richest. 

4 cups milk — a quart. 

I heaped cup com meal— 6 ounces. 

Butter size of an egg — 2 ounces. 

I large cooking spoon molasses — 

^ ounces. 



4 eggs (8 yolks are better.) 

I small lemon. 

Make mush of the milk and meal and 
set it at the back of the range, or -on a 
brick and with a tight lid on keep 
cooking slowly for an hour or two. Then 
grate in the rind of lemon and squeeze in 
iuic, of half; add the black molasses, 
butter and eggs and bake in a 2 quart pan 
about ^ hour. It makes 3 pints. As 
only half the people, or probably less 
will order pudding or any other ordinary 
dish in a plentiful dinner this amount is 
enough for a dinner for 30. There are 
plenty of cooks even in very good hotels 
who can never make a satisfactory In- 
dian pudding ; it runs with them from a 
hard corn cake to a sort of brown gruel 
which nobody wants. The only remedy 
is to weigh or measure the ingredients 
and follow directions. 

885 -Mixed Fruits For Pies. 

When certaia kinds of fruits have been 
repeatedly used because of their plenti- 
fulness some variety may be had by mix- 
ing two sorts together. Apples and 
blackberries are good in any fonn of 
pastry when so mixed ; in the bakery pies, 
No. -^03, in steamed fruit puddings, No. 
176, and in the ordinary family pie — and 
mulberries which aro almost useless 
alone may be used as well as any other 
fruit if mixed with an acid variety. 



886— Trouble With Captain Joh son. 

The trouble with Captain Johnson 
was, he was too superficial in his methods 
for his own interests and was not so 
smart as he thought himself. It was a 
long way from this place; yet I could not 
help reverting to one of the extremes of 
wastefulness, wheii, by a singular unfit- 
ness of season, jurt as I was deploring the 
loss of frying fat in making the dinner of 
two days ago, the woodman, or keeper of 
this place through the winter time, came 
with a complaint that he is netting no 
grease this summer for his wife to make 
her winter's soap with, as he has been 
used to do, and that the waste from the 
kitchen is not sufficient to fatten over 
half the pigs he has supplied himself 
wiih, and his pork crop will be deplora- 
bly short. He intimates that his place is 



SAN JiRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



J20 



not worth much to him if shorn of these 
I)erquisites. This is a sad a\se, but none 
of us get any such perquisites in this 
house. The question is here how a 
good table can be set in a house that 
charges ten dollars a week when all the 
saving ways of turning one thing into an- 
other and using up everything by the ap- 
pliance of skill such as the French are 
credited with in the same Ime are brought 
into requisition and carried out industri- 
ously, and not how many hogs can we 
fatten, or how many barrels of grease can 
we make. Poor John! By the time the 
little suet that comes on the closely 
trimmed meats has been used for short- 
ening pie crusts and puddings, and the 
fat from the roasts and soups is used for 
frying and sautemg, there is hardly 
enough left for him to grease his boots 
with. I know from experience that 
thousands of meals are sold daily for from 
20 to 25 cents that are allowed to cost 40 
or 50 cents, not through what the people 
eat or want, but because of the unneces- 
sary wastes of all kinds and the extrane- 
ous expenses, and the sellers of meals on 
those losing terms are only kept up by 
their beds, their bar profits, livery or 
other source of revenue. 

John is a young man and was born too 
late. He would have been happy on 
Captain Johnson's steamboat on the 
Mississippi where the cooks made from 
7^ to 10^ barrels of grease to sell for 
themselves every trip the boat made. It 
will be observed there was always a half I 
barrel— that is where Captain Johnson ' 
comes in. He could neither read nor 
write, but he owned his steamboat and 
she was a good one — the America — carry- 
ing cotton, tobacco and pork from the 

city of N , State of 1' ., to 

New Orleans, and taking molasses and 
imported goods on the return trip. But 
New Orleans was the point the employes 
considered the beginning and the end of 
the trip. This used to take about three 
weeks on the average. On every trip up 
the boat used to take on a supply of pine 
knots at the moutn of Red River; that 
was racing fuel kept ready in case any 
boat came in sight, that it was necessary 
to beat; for ihe America could beat most 
of them. But before reaching Red River 
on the return trip, that stock of pine was 
exhausted; and there being nothing but 
Tennessee poplar and gum wood on the 



boat. It was no^ uncommon thing for the 
engineers to seize all the bacon shoulders 
and hams they could lay their hands on 
to mix with it to make more steam. The 
cooks thought that a very poor use to 
put fat bacon to, and, to prevent it, all 
they could lay their hands on, they cut 
up and laid snugly out of the engineers' 
reach in the bottom of their grease bar- 
rels. Captain Johnson, as may well 
be supposed, was averse to all such pro- 
ceedings, and instituted a rule which none 
dared break, that no soap-grease man 
should take away the "slush" or any part 
of it before he had examined it. Does 
the reader think that that placed the boys 
in a bad fix? Not at all ; they knew him 
well. So every trip on the day of reach- 
ing port he went down into the kitchen 
and rolled up his right sleeve. 

"Well, boys, how many barrels of 
slush have you made this trip?" ( This is 
where the politicians get the word "slush 
money"). "Only eight and a half. Cap- 
tain, — been as saving on you as possible 
— it might have been ten barrels if we 
hadn't took good care." 

"Eight — nine! wh}^ you villains— 
what do you mean, going to rob me out 
of my boat?" 

"Captain, we had a big trip of passen- 
gers up, and a long trip, and the meats 
were some fatter than usual, and this 
ain't so much as last trip by half a — " 

"Let me see it— let mj see it — well, 
why don't you bring me my long flesh 
fork — here— no, not that, the long one. 
Oh you infernal rascals, I know you. I 
began life as a cook myself, and I know 
you." 

And with that Captain Johnson began 
forking the contents of the first full barrel 
over into the half-filled barrel that stood 
ready for it. By the time the full barrel 
was half emptied the half barrel was, of 
course, full; and, having no more room, 
he commenced forking over the next full 
barrel into that he had just quit, never 
reaching the bottom of any barrel in the 
row, but keeping up his talk all the 
while. 

"You can't rob me, boys, I've got eyes 
and my eyes ain't sheep's eyes that you 
can pull the wool over — I've been a cook 
and I know the ropes — and — and I've 
pulled 'em all — there, now ; I've got you, 
what's this?" 



191 



COOKING I^OR PROFIT, 



But it aUvays proved to be a bare bone 
or something worthless ; and so the farce 
was always carried out on every trip dur- 
ing the eigtit month's season, and the 
boys received $4 a barrel from the soap 
men for spending money as soon as the 
boat reached the wharf. 

It stands in proof that human nature — 
even steamboat human nature — is not 
wholly depraved; that nobody ever 
wounded Captain Johnson's self-love by 
informing him how grossly he was bemg 
deceived. Suppose the boys beat him out 
of a hundred dollars over and above what 
was right ; he must be dead before this ; 
for he was well along in years at^ that 
time, and surely it was worth twice a 
hundred dollars to him to die in the 
happy belief that nobody had ever been 
able to pull the wool over his eves.

Total $5 20; 32 persons, 16 cents a

887— Potagea la Bagration. 



Anything denominated bagration will 

Erove to be a mixture of fish and vegeta- 
les. For potage bagration make a white 
rice soup with mixed vegetables cut in 
small dice and fish cut small, about one- 
third of it milk, and flavor with curry or 
saflron. If in Lent make the stock of 
the fish by boiling it whole, take out, strain 
the liquor and cut the fish in pieces to be 
added after the rice and vegetables are 
cooked enough. The soup should be 
rather thick with rice and fish and well 
sprinkled with parsley at dishing-up 
time. 

Careme was at one period in the ein- 
ploy of the Countess of Bagration; it is 
probable that the half dozen dishes bear- 
ing that designation were named in com- 
pliment to her or to the house. 



888— Croaker in Batter, Sauce Re- 
moulade. 



The croaker is a southern sea-fish, 
small, something like a white perch — 
good for frying and broiling. 

Split the fish lengthwise, remove the 
bone, salt well, dip in thin batter same as 
for a la Horly, or same as fruit fritters, 
and fry in lard not too hot. Serve with 
sauce and some special form of potatoes. 



889 — Sauce Remoulade. 



Remoulade is the French name of a 
favorite kind of salad dressing that is 
made with cooked yolks in partj has gar- 
lic, shalots and parsley added. It is dif- 
ferent from mayonaise which is made 
with raw yolks. Looks like sauce tartare, 
which is minced pickles and shalots 
(young onions) in mayonaise. Take : 

3 hard boiled yolks. 

I raw yolk. 

^ cup olive oil. 

Same of melted fresh butter. 

5^ cup vinegar. 

1 teaspoon salt, pinch of cayenne. 

1 teaspoon made mustard. 

2 or 3 cloves of garlic crushed and 
minced, and 2 tablespoons finely minced 
green onions. 

Pound the hard-boiled yolks in a bowl 



SAN liRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



122 



with the butter ; add salt, mustard pep- 
per; then the raw yolk, or two of them, 
and stir in the oil gradually and alter- 
nately with the vinegar. It makes a but- 
tery compound that is a most excellent 
salad dressing without the garlic and on- 
ion, but add those to make the sauce 
remoulade. 



8£0— Potatoes Algerienne. 

Cut raw potatoes in large cubes (dice) 
same as for Brabant, the more perfect 
the better ; the outside trimmings of po- 
tato can be used to mash. IS team or 
boil first and let get cold, then saute the 
cubes in a frying pan like Dutch fried. 
Sprinkle with salt and parsley when done. 
Serve with fish and as a garnish for en- 
trees. Cold boiled potatoes can be used 
equally as well as raw, and the outside 
cuttings cooked a la Lyonaise. 

Lyonaise refers to the city of Lyons in 
France. Bazaine was the name of a 
general. 



891— Lmince rf Veal With Eggs. 



with the macaroni and cheese. 

Take deep gem pans or patty pans of 
sufficient number, butter and coat them 
with cracker dust, press in the macaroni 
mixture, put a small lump of butter on 
top; bake brown. 

Serve with a spoonful of gravy in the 
dish, the timbale turned out of the 
mould, a conical pile of cheese on top. 

.Named for Rossini, the composer, who 
IS said to have been extremely partial to 
both truffles and macaroni. 



893— Sliced 



Bread and 
ding. 



Butter Pud- 



loaf. 



Trim up the remains of cold veal or 
shave off the outside of cold cooked cut- 
lets; mince the meat small, put in a pan 
with few spoonfuls of hot gravy, season- 
ing of powdered thyme or sage or nut- 
meg, ialt and pepper; make hot without 
cooking. Serve neatly a spoonful heaped 
in a sniall dish with a lengthwise quarter 
or two of hard-boiled egg on top and \ 
croutons, fancy potatoes or quenelles for 
ornament. 



1 pound bread in slices — about i 
'^/^QM'^ butter. 
4 cups milk. 

2 tablespoons sugar, 

3 eggs (6 yolks are better.) 
I cup currants. 

Grated nutmeg enough to flavor. 

Have the slices free from dark crust, 
spread the butter on them, place in two 
layers in the pudding pan with currants 
between and on top. Beat eggs, su_;ar, 
milk and nutmeg together, and pour over 
the bread, cover with either buttered pa- 
per or crust and bake half an hour. Serve 
with sauce or sweetened cream. 



892 — Timbales cf Macaroni, 
Rossini. 



a la 



A timbale is a shape, niould or form ; 
the term is not often applied to anything 
but moulds of macaroni, rice and potato. 

Cook J^ pound of macaroni, and when 
cold, cut It in inch lengths, and mix with 
it a cupful of grated cheese, little salt 
and pepper. 

Slice up Vz cup of button mushrooms, 
same of cold, smoked tongue, same of 
truffles or boiled chicken (livers substi- 
tute); moisten them with a spoonful of 
Spanish sauce or gravy ; then mix them 



894— Choccilat Cake— Best. 

2 cups granulated sugar — a pound. 
I cup butter — ^ pound. 

1 cup milk — Yz pint. 

5 cups flour — little over a pound. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 

12 whites of eggs — or i^ cups. 

4 ounces chocolate. 

Vanilla extract. 

Make up same as white cake. No. 622, 
melt the chocolate by warming it in a 
cup with nothing added, and beat it into 
the cake. Vanilla extract improves the 
chocolate flavor but is not essential. 4 
pounds cost 48 cents. 



895— Trouble in Serving IVleals. 

At a pleasure resort it is the same as on 
board a steamer or at the first table of a 
public banquet, everybody sits down to 
the table at the same instant, and, to all 



"3 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



appearances, begins instantly to wish 
that he were the only guest and all the 
other people were waiters so that he 
might be instantaneously served. It may 
seem somewhat ridiculous in people who 
have really nothing else to do to become 
so impatient over a little delay in receiving 
their meals ; but with that we have noth- 
ing to do; to be successtul in serving 
meals it is quite as important to get them 
on the table expeditiously as it is*to have 
them well cooked. 

It happened that I was a passenger 
on two excursion steamers belongmg 
to the same line on the great lakes and 
saw on board one of the very worst, and 
on the other the very best method in 
practice for dealing with this diflBiculty. 
The first was the newest, largest, finest, 
steamerof the line, the pet of the com- 
pany, and, being too good to adopt com- 
mon ways, its dining saloon was run on 
the plan of those high-priced restaurants 
which get about one customer in every 
half hour, and keep him reading the pa- 
per another half hour, while they cook a 
meal for him, but it did not work on this 
steamer, where a hundred people sat 
down at once, and did not want to wait 
over a half minute apiece. There was 
nothing on the tables that people could 
help themselves to. The waiters were 
almost invisible ; a few ladies at the fur- 
ther end took up all their time putting a 
little more water in their tea, and chang- 
ing their beefsteaks for one a little better 
done, while all the rest at all the other 
tables sat uimoticed and getting madder 
the longer they sat. Perhaps a waiter 
with a tray load of cups full of coffee 
would be captured by one table, and an- 
other with meat or rolls by another, but 
very seldom did all the parts of a meal 
meet together at any one place; the ser- 
vice was, therefore, an utter failure, and 
the quality of the cooker}' could not even 
come into consideration, no matter how 
high the pretensions of the boat to supe- 
riority might be. The other boat had 
two long tables with a large part of the 
staple articles that go to complete a meal 
Set upon it within easy reach — the indi- 
vidual butters and creams, bread, pickled 
jellies, mustard, sugar, cheese, salt — 
there was a saucer as well as a plate at 
every seat. When the steward's bell taps 
for breakfast as the passengers filed in and 
tOok their places the waiters at the same 



time carne on with their trays ready 
loaded with the dishes which were surest 
to be called for — beefsteaks, ham, eggs, 
chops, hot breads and fried potatoes — 
and with cups of coffee, and by the time 
the people were well in their seats, the 
full meal was before them, and if the 
waiters were then sent off by a few for 
chocolate, hot milk, boiled fish instead of 
fried omelets, or a little more water in 
the tea, they did not leave the great major- 
ity in a state of suffenng and suspense. 
There is a good deal in having plenty of 
waiters; and yet that is not all; for often 
there are so many they are in one anoth- 
er's way, becau:e of the impossibility of 
getting the cooking or carving done just 
enough to keep them in motion. It is 
scarcely necessary to say that all was 
joy and peace and contentment on this 
steamer where the passengers found their 
soup jdst being set at their place as they 
reached it and where the ice cream and 
cake came even before they were ready 
for them, and the waiters seemed almost 
troublesome by their frequent offerings of 
fruit and glasses of water, while the other 
steamer, the too good one, came into 
port loaded down to the guards with re- 
mains of good intentions, of good things 
that were provided, but could never be 
served, and with execrations and male- 
dictions of the dissatisfied. Bestowing 
some thought on these things before we 

Eull the bell rope at our little summer 
ouse, we have the eggs broke and dishes 
ready for immediate trying, the gridiron 
chock full of steaks and chops already 
sizzUng over the glowing charcoal and 
the gravy made ready; and we get the 
housekeeper to come, like a good fellow, 
and dish up the stewed tomatoes, pota- 
toes, oat meal and side dishes generally, 
while we are turning out the omelets and 
eggs, or carving the roast, and our "sec" 
is making toast or serving ice cream and 
fiiiit.

Total $5 50; 32 persons, 17 cents a 
plate. 

896— Consomme With Quenelles. 

Clear soup like No. 139 with yellow 
egg balls in the plates. One way of mak- 
ing egg balls for such purposes may be 
lound at No. 797. Another sort is made 
as follows: Put into a small sauce- 
pan a heaping tablespoon of flour, and 
about the same weight of butter, and stir 
them over the fire as if to make butter 
sauce, instead of a full cup of water or 
broth, which this amount of flour would 
thicken, pour in only half a cup, stir up, 
and you have a stiff butter paste. Add 
the yolks of 4 eggs, one after the other, 
stirrmg over the fire until they are cooked 
in the mixture. Season with salt, if not 
enough in the butter, cayenne and 
nutmeg. Make in balls when cool, size 
of : rapes, poach them in water, drop 4 
or 5 in each plate of consomme when 
served . Another way is to pound 4 hard 
boiled yolks with an equal amount of 
butter, add all the dry flour needed to 
make dough of it, make in balls and 
boil. 



897— Red Snapper a la Joinvilie. 

Remove the rough skin of this fish 



with the point of a sharp knife or by dip- 
ping in boiling water, but it need not be 
split open. Brush over with egg, sift 
cracker meal upon it, take up and place 
in baking pan with oil or lard and bake 
light brown, basting once. Make white 
sauce (veloute) with fish liquor or oyster 
liquor and a small portion of white wine. 
Add to it oysters, crayfish, button mush- 
rooms, very small onions, shrimps and 
scallops, or such substitutes as may be 
available to make a good matelotte sauce 
with wme, salt and cayenne. Serve por- 
tions of the fish with plenty of the mate- 
lotte poured over, and potatoes in some 
special form in the same place. Can be 
served whole for a party as well with the 
matelotte poured around, sliced lemons 
on the fish and potato boulettes or Par- 
isienne stacked in groups at ends and 
sides. 
Joinvilie is the title of a French prmce 



898— Potato BouLttes. 



Potato balls, made of potato croquette 
mixture with another raw y^lk added to 
make it moist. Roll in flour till they 
have taken a good coating and without 
egging or breading ; fry them in the fry- 
ing basket in very hot lard, only a min- 
ute or two. They burst open if fried too 
long. They should be about the size of 
walnuts or little larger. Serve two in 
each plate offish. 



899— Veal Cutlets, IVlilanaise. 

Cut 8 cutlets small and thin, but of 
good shape ; dust with powdered herbs, 
salt and pepper; dip both sides in a plate 
of flour and let them remain in it until 
near dinner time. Melt 4 ounces of but- 
ter in a frying pan, and, when it froths 
up, lay in the cutlets and saute them 
brown. Serve durect out of the pan with 
the hot, brown butter adhering, and a 
few olives and a quarter of lemon in the 
dish. 



900— Vinaig ette of Brains, a 
Provencale. 



la 



French vinaigrette sauce of minced 
pickles and shalots of olive oil seasoned 



^^5 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



\yith salt and pepper; poured over a por- 
tion of calfs brains previously boiled. 

Parboil the brains first, and pick off all 
the dark stains, divide in portions and 
simmer for half an hour in seasoned 
broth, cut up a lemon in them and keep 
hot till served. The vinaigrette sauce to 
be kept cold. It is thick with minced 
pickles and shalots enough to season — 
like tartar sauce made of clear oil instead 
of mayonaise. 



901— Boiled P UT] Pudding. 

1 pound white bread crumbs — ^4 pressed 
cups. 

^ pound sugar — i cup. 

Yi pound minced suet — 2 pressed cups. 

J4 pound raisins — i heaped cup. 

Same of currants. 

I cup milk. 

4 eggs, pinch soda and salt. 

I teaspoon mixed ground spices — cin- 
nampn, nutmeg, mace, alspice. 

Mil the dry articles together— the 
bread crumbs chopped very fine ; mix the 
milk and eggs, salt and soda, and, if you 
use brandy or wine, add a few spoonfuls 
and pour it over the dry mixture and stir 
up thoroughly. Tie up in two pudding 
bags, or put in two moulds and boil or 
steam them 4 hours. Brandy sauce, 
or sabayon or No. 733. 

Cost, bread 5, sugar 4, suet 4, raisins 
and currants 10, milk i, eggs 5, spices, 
lemon peel or liquor 5 ; 34 cents for 3^ 
pounds or 25 orders. 



902— Trouble With the Manager. 



The trouble with our manager is, he is 
not making as much money as he ex- 
pected, and he is looking at the table 
and at my regularly rendered account of 
cost per "meal to find the reason why. 
Another of those blue spells has come 
upon us which often occur early in Au- 
gust when it turns unseasonably cold and 
there has been two days of steady rain. 
The people sit and mope and have no 
appetites for meals, eet tired of them- 
selves and want to get up and go, arid 
some do go ; many resort houses are al- 
most emi)tied by the occurrence of two 
rainy days. Not only that, but those 
who are free are often curious to try a 



number of different places during the 
season and although the average of goers 
and comers may be equal in the end,, 
there are times when an hotel is almost 
depopulated for no reason but that it is 
the ebb before the flood, and it happens 
so. 

The way it began between the mana- 
ger and myself was this : You see the 
manager at such a small place as this has 
to be a gentleman of all-work ; he is re» 
quired to look sweet, and play croquette 
and tennis part of the time, but he alsa 
acts as host, clerk, cashier, bookkeeper,, 
paymaster and part steward. As long as 
there was nobody in the house and no 
bills to collect we will suppose the owner 
of the place put up the money for ex- 
penses, but when there began to be some 
j receipts, the manager was told to go it 
alone, and I expect he has been counting: 
over his money. Day after to-morrow- 
he has to pay all his help, the tenth being 
the day of the month alinost always ob- 
served in that way, for by that time the 
monthly bills which fall due on the first 
have been collected and the indebtedness 
to the butcher and market men has been 
liquidated, then when the employees are 

Caid he can count over his balance on 
and, or at least ask where it is. If our 
crowd had kept up to about forty-five 
souls he would have been away ahead 
and would have asked me no questions; 
as it is he has been asked on every trip to 
town to bring back a couple of cans of 
mushrooms, or a dozen lemons, or a can 
of shrimps and bottle of oil and so forth 
and while he always brings them he hesi- 
tates and asks first if they are really nec- 
essaiv, with a great stress laid upon the 
"really." Now, the butcher at the Glen 
know^ we get our meats by express and 
never go to him except in a case of ne- 
cessity ; consequently, he puts his finger 
in our manager's eye every time he sells 
him a piece of meat. This afternoon he 
sold the manager — who is proud to say 
he does not know one piece of meat from 
another— a piece of the neck of beef for 
a roast, and flour briskets of mutton for 
racks and loins to cut into chops, and 
when I explained the manageronly laugh- 
ed, and said it was good enough, and he 
would like to make some money anyhow,, 
and there was no use of being so particular 
Then he went on to ask why the dinners 
now were costing sixteen and seventeea

cents a plate according to my own show- 
ing; whereas, for two or three weeks 
they ran from seven to eleven cents only, 
and why the same cheap scale could 
not be always preserved. There is no 
reason why. He is in the right. Ten- 
cent dinners such as we had three weeks 
back could be continued all the season, 
and give satisfaction. However, I have 
not been under any instruction or restraint 
in this matter. If the owner of the place 
has had any thought about the matter, it 
has probably been only to see what I 
would do, and in what ways this sum- 
mer's style would difier from the house- 
hold style of keeping up a table. John, 
the keeper, has been comparing the fru- 
gal management of provisions this sum- 
mer, which leaves him no perquisites with 
the waste of former years, which gave 
him a large pork crop, and he thinks it 
extreme nig^^ardliness. 

The manager, who was not here last 
year, is comparing the seventeen -cents-a- 
plate of to-day, with the ten-cents-a- 
plate of last month, and it seems to him 
a change to extravagance. There is no 
room for a reasonable doubt that there 
was much wasted last year through 
want of knowing what to do with it, and 
through cooking too much as it lakes to 
make our most expensive meals now. 
The extravagance of the dinners, such as 
it is, arises from the use of more meat in 
the soups and sauces, the use of sea-fish, 
which the butcher sends according to a 
custom which prevails, at eleven cents, 
and which costs 121^, delivered; where- 
as, the lake fish costs but 9; and the 
cooking in fillets entails a loss of bulk 
and requires more pounds gross for a 
given number of people than if cooked 
plain, with the bones in. There has 
been an indulgence in a few cans of pine- 
apple, and other fruits in syrup, a few 
olives, a bottle of wine, a mmcing up of 
pickles, a rather more lavish use of es:gs 
and crackers for frying, and of lard for 
the same, a little waste in the matter of 
potatoes in fancy forms, the new potatoes 
being dearer than the old, and all the 
odd cents counted up together have 
swelled the sum total. There has not 
been a corresponding increase in the cost 
of breakfast and supper, the latter, in- 
deed, being half made up of the meats 
and other remains from dinner, and be- 
ing quite an mexpensive meal. 



But what are we here for? Nut alone 
to see how cheaply one summer hotel 
can be kept, but to find out how mucli 
it costs to live we]l. The custom men- 
tioned in connection with the butcher is, 
that one who supplies a number of hotels 
occasionally get a refrigerator car full of 
special kinds of provisions, which he 
sends around to his first-class customers, 
without waiting for the' order, assuming 
that a novely will be welcome in the 
height of the season.

Eight military cadets arrived shortly 
before dinner — had 10 add a little here 
and there but, practicially, the same din- 
ner was «5iifificient that would have been 
prepared for 32 — it is but a more thor- 
ough clean-up of the dishes and a little 
ekeing out of the corn and ice cream, 
and a few slices of cake served in place 
of the departed pudding. In a case like 
this it is the home folks that go without.

neck will do or the long strings of the 
flank which some butchers sell attached 
to the f )orter house steaks ; cut in pieces, 
put ii into a jar or pot with 6 quarts of 
water and set it in the oven while break- 
fast is going on or at such a time that it 
may bake 3 hours. Sometime while bak- 
ing throw mto the jar an onion cut small, 
a piece of carrot, turnip, celery and pars- 
nip or whichever may be at hand, merely 
to give a little flavor, but the meat gravy 
is the characteristic of the soup and not 
the vegetables. Season with salt and 
pepper. Take out the meat and reserve 
It for a side dish. Skim the fat off the 
soup, add a little flour thickening, boil 
up and serve with a few squares of toasted 
bread in the plates. 



904 — Stewe^ Codfish and Fctatces. 

Chop a pound of salt codfish in pieces 
size of walnuts, steep them a few hours 
to freshen, boil in water, throw that away 
and boil again in fresh water and milk ; 
put in as many potatoes as there are 
pieces of fish, also a small onion, lump of 
butter, pepper, and thicken like white 
sauce with flour. 



905--Broast \y L-mb, a la Jardinicr. 



Chop briskets of mutton lengthwise in 
strips, put them in a deep baking pan 
witn seasonings and vegetables, cover 
with buttered paper and let cook in the 
oven until quite tender and the liquor is 
dried down. 

Prepare a bright-colored jardini.r of 
very green peas, white and yellow tur- 
nips, string btans, summer squash, cu- 
cumbers, carrots, whatever ot the kind 
can be had except beets which would 
color everythmg. Cut these vegetables 
all to une small size, and boil in water 
till done. Mix them in one saucepan 
and pour over them the seasoned gravy, 
maae in the baking pan, which should 
not, however, be of a dark color. Serve 
cutb of the braised libs of lamb or mutton 
smothered with the vegetables and a 
spoonful of gravy poured under. 

906— Ragouts cf Bief, a la Creole. 
Take the pieces of beef from the soup 



pot and cut to medium sized portions. 
Mince an onion, crush a half head of 
garlic with the side of your knife, and 
mince that; put them on in a frying pan 
with a spoonful of the clear fat from the 
soup and st r over the fire until cooked 
and beginning to brown; then add a 
small can of tomatoes, rubbed through a 
colander; season with salt and pepper, 
then put in the pieces of beef and keep 
simmering, set upon a brick until fer/ea. 
If not likely to be a thick sauce b)^ boil- 
ing down there should be a little thicken- 
ing of roux or raw flour added to the to- 
matoes. Cut a leaf shaped crouton of 
thin bread for each dish and fry them 
brown to be placed at the end for orna- 
ment and for use. 



907— Baked Indian Pudding—Cheap. 

1 pound corn meal. 

2 quarts water.

Total $3 16; 40 persons, nearly 8 cents

908— Welsh Rar. b:t— Three Ways 

A Welsh rarebit is a slice of cheese 
baked upon a slice of bread; the season- 
ings are optional. 

1. A good and easy way for a family 

Earty is to cut a number of thin slices of 
read, toast them and spread with butter; 
cut a very thin slice of cheese for each 
one, place in a baking pan and bake on 
the top shelf in the oven until the cheese 
is melted; serve hot or bake only three or 
four at a time if the orders come that 
way. 

2. This is more elaborate; it is the 
restaurant and club style : 

I pound cheese. 

4 ounces butter. 

I glass ale. 

Salt, cayenne. 

10 slices of toast. 

Mince the cheese small, put it and the 
butter in a saucepan, set over the fire and 1 
work them together with a spatula or a 

E3stle until the cheese is hot and melted, 1 
ut take care not to let it reach boiling 
heat, but keep it cooled by adding ale in I 
small portions until the mixture is smooth | 
and creamy. Add cayenne and perhaps I 
a little salt if not enough in the butter. I 
Place thin slices of toast in the dishes, ' 
pour a spoonful of the creamed cheese 
upon them and set in the top of the oven 
for 3 or 4 minutes. Pour a little ale upon 
the edges of the toast and serve. 

3. For a large number as in a hotel, 
the creamed cheese prepared as above 
may be kept warm without boiling by 
setting in a vessel of hot water, the toast 
kept ready and spread with a spoonful of 
the cheese as called for and sent in with- 
out baking. 

4. Instead of ale use milk and a 
milder flavored dish will be the result, 
which may suit better at a country 
house. 



909~Che^se bondue. 



Is the name of a sort of cheese trmelet 



that is fully half cheese and is a dish 
much esteemed in some quarters, and 
does not mean the same as fondu or 
melted cheese. 

Make the creamed cheese as for the 
Welsh rarebits of the foregoing receipts, 
and while stirring over the fire break in 6 
eggs, one at a time, and finish like 
scrambled or buttered eggs. Serve on 
toast or in a dish bordered with toast cut 
in shapes. 



910— Smoked Salmon— Broiled. 



Cut smoked and dried salmon in broil- 
ing slices and steep in water for half a 
day. Dry the slices on a cloth, brush 
with butter and broil about 5 minutes.

olate 8, bread 4, sugar 12 (131 cents.) 

Total $3 68; 40 persons; little over 9 
cents a plate. 



911— Codfish Balls. 



There should be nearly as much fish 
used as potato, say i pound of salt codfish 
to 8 potatoes. Codfish balls cannot be 
made very good with cold mashed pota- 
toes; all should be fresh boiled for the 
purpose and made up hot. 

Steep a pound of codfish in water to 



COOKING lOR PROFIT, 



129 



freshen it, boil in two waters, pick free 
from bones, mash it thoroughly in a pan 
with a potato masher. Turn m the hot 
potatoes and pound them together, add 
a seasoning of black pepper, vety little 
butter and, if you choose, i egg or 2 or 3 
yolks. Make up in balls either round or 
flattened with plenty of flour on the 
hands ; drop in hot lard and fry brown. 
If they do not have a good appearance 
when done you can change it next time 
by breading them in egg and cracker 
meal. 



912— Cream Chocolate 

There was the Queen and Crescent 
restaurant enjoying qui'e a reputation for 
its chocolate, every cup of which was 
said to be served with ^"hipped cream on 
top although, in fact, no cream ever came 
near it — it was simply made to order and 
whisked up while on the fire as directed 
at our No. c^, but with less milk than 
that, and served with the appearance of 
whipped chocolate cream upon it. And 
there was, close by, the Hotel Fantastic, 
on Fantastic Beach, that was said never 
to have served a good cup of chocolate 
during the whole ot its unprofitable ex- 
istence. Such is the difference resulting 
from the methods of making — the latter 
using twice as much chocolate, making 
it hours too soon and spoiling it irrevo- 
cably in the detestable, bain-marie can, 
a miniature mud well. 



Custard pie (2 large, deep 24 cents.) 

Blueberry pie (i qt, 2 pies, large, thin

August 10. 

Soup— Consomme Knickeibocker (6 
qts 30 cents.) 

Lake trout stuffed (3 lbs and stuffing,

Roast chicken with currant jelly (4 
hens, 32 orders no cents.) 

Beef a la mode Allemande (3 lbs net

Summer squash 14, beets 4, cabbage 
10, rice 3, corn 15, potatoes 15; (61 
cents.) 

Baked prune pudding (2^ qts with 
sauce 28 cents.) 



913— Consomme Knickerbocker. 

It is chicken broth made dark colored 
with fried vegetables and chopped fresh 
tomatoes, and a small amount of barley 
added. When you have fowls that must 
be boiled before roasting, the liquor they 
are boiled in makes good soup. Strain 
and ikim it. Cut a mixture of small 
vegetables in dice and saute them with a 
little butter and sugar, the same as for 
Julienne ; when lightly colored put them 
into the broth, and, if you have no fresh 
tomatoes, use the solid part of the canned 
cut in pieces, and without the juice. 
Barley should be boiled separately for it, 
or rice that is already cooked may be 
washed off" clear and tised instead. Sea- 
son to taste. 



914— Fish stuffed and Baked. 



Make a small amount of stuffing the 
same as for chicken and turkey, and sea- 
soned with either powdered thyme or 
sage, and add an egg or two yolks. The 
back bone can be taken out of the fish 
without Quite dividing the two sides, by 
cutting down inside nearly to the skin, 
and pulling the bone away. Wash the 
fish and dry it ; spread the stufiSng on one 
side, double over to the origmal shape ; it 
may be sewed up with thread, but will 
do very well without. Place in the bak- 
ing pan and score the upper side with a 
sharp knife in places where it is to be cut 
when done. Put a minced onion and 
some scraps of fat, salt pork in the pan, 
a spoonful of drippings, water and salt 
and bake nearly an hour. Serve out of 
the pan with a spoonful cf Spanish sauce 



130 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



or other gravy, and potatoes in the same 
plate. 



915— Potatoes a la Colbert. 



Like marechale, largest size of Paris- 
ienne, size of crab apples, of raw pota- 
toes, but steamed for this style instead of 
baked brown, and sprinkle with fine 
parsley, salt and melted butter. 



916— Roast Chicken with Currant 
Jelly. 

Boil old fowls two hours, take out, 
dredge with salt and pepper, then with 
fiour, which insures a good, rich brown 
color, and bake about %i hour. Carve 
and serve with gravy ana currant jelly. 

917~Beef a la Mode Allemande, or 
German. 



Lard a piece of lean beef in the usual 
way by drawing it full of strips of pork or 
bacon fat, put it in a jar or pot in the 
oven, with water enough to cover, and 
salt, pepper and few pieces of carrot and 
turnip, and bake about three hours. 
Take out the meat, skim and strain the 
lifluor, add to it a cupful of white wine, 
one of raisins and one of prunes, and a 
small amount of flour thickening and 
boil up. Put back into the gravy the 
vegetables that were strained out lifore 
and serve this sauce with the cuts of beef. 

918— Braised Mutton with Ni>dels. 

Something like mutton with beans, a 
la Bretonne, but with nudels (noodles or 
nouilles) cooked separately and in gravy 
to serve with the cuts of mutton. 

The briskets of mutton as well as the 
shoulders can be used up in this way. 
Take out the bones, season the meat and 
roll It up and bake or braise it long 
enough to make it quite tender, always 
keepmg water enough in the pan to keep 
It from drymg out, and a cover of greased 
paper on top. 



919— Baked Prune Pudding. 

Make a bread pudding, either No. 113 



doubled perhaps in quantity, or at No. 
3go. Take three cups of stewed prunes 
without the juice and drop them in as 
you would raisins ; the prunes are better 
if pitted and sprinkled with lemon juice. 



920— Summer Squash. 

This vegetable should always be 
steamed, or at any rate not boiled in wa- 
ter, it being an object to get it as dry as 
possible so as to allow the addition of 
milk or cream when it is mashed. Shave 
ofi the outside thinly with a sharp knife ; 
cut each squash in six or eight pieces. It 
depends upon the age and distinctness of 
the seeds whether they should be cut out 
or not; if large enough to show promi- 
nently in the mashed squash take out the 
entire core. Squash cooks in about half 
an hour, and may be allowed to simmer 
and dry out more after mashing and sea- 
soning, in a pan set upon a couple of 
bricks.

COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



W 



921-Potag 



Parmentler, or Potato 
Soup, 



Named for the man, M. Parmentier, 
who first brought tiie potato into France. 

Take about lo or 12 potatoes, steam or 
boil, mash and mk them with a quart of 
boiling milk or cream. Have a well 
seasoned soup stock ready made with beef 
and veal bones and the usual vegetables 
and a knuckle bone of boiled ham and a 
large onion additional boilea in it, and 
slightly thicken it while boiling, which 
will prevent the potato puree from set- 
tling. Mix 4 quarts of this stock with the 
potato cream, pass through a strainer or 
seive, season with salt and pepper, add a 
sprinkling of minced parsley and keep hot 
without Ijoiling. Serve crusts or puff- 
paste croutons (No. 736) in the plates. 

922— Breast of Veal with Browned 
Potatoes, or a TAngiaise. 

Saw through the ribs to make conven- 
ient cuts ; cook as dir-jcted for rib ends of 
beef and serve new potatoes first steamed 
and then browned in the oven, and gravy 
in the dish. 



923— Ragout of Giblets en 
fade. 



CrouS' 



Boil the livers, gizzards, hearts and 
necks of poultry in water to cover, when 
done drain thena out and cut all into 
small pieces. Mince an onion and fry it 
in two ounces of butter or oil, put in two 
tablespoons flour and stir until it begins 
to brown, strain in the giblet liquor and 
a little Spanish sauce, Worcestershire 
sauce, or gravy besides; cut a slice of 
ham ia small dice, throw that in and 
then the cut giblets. Season with cay- 
enne and salt and wine, if wanted. Serve 
in patty shells or croustades like the fol- 
lowing. 



92&— Corn Prlttirs or Mock Ovs^ers 
—Two Ways. 



The French way of making com fritters 
is found at No. 817. These two ways, 
one with canned com and one with 
roasting ears the cheaper and much more 
popular. 

1. To one can of com allow 2 eggs, 
an ounce of softened butter, teaspoon of 
mixed salt and pepper and about a cup 
of flour or accoraing to the dryness of 
the com. Stir up vigorously. Set a fry- 
ing pan over the fire with lard in it just to 
cover the bottom when hot and drop in 
spoonfuls of the com mixture flattened 
and about the size of large fried oysters. 
Cook brown on both sides and serve hot 
and fresh cooked. Good for a breakfast 
dish as well as for dinner. 

2. Take ears of green com and shave 
off the cob, and every pint count the 
same as one can above, and proceed the 
same way. These made with green com 
have more of the taste of oysters than the 
others. 



926— New Green Apple Pie. 



Apples before they are ripe are best 
used this way. Steana them as you would 
potatoes without paring, when done mash 
them through a colander. Add sugar, 
butter and nutmeg to the pulp and make 
open pies with crust rolled thin, same 
style as pumpkin pie. 



927— Gipsy Pudding. 



924— Croustades or Shells of Rice. 

Make the same as directed for potato 
croustades, No. 874, using boiled rice 
mashed with yolk of egg instead of po- 
tato. 



Sponge jelly cake floating in a pan of 
cold custard. 

Make the sponge cake No. 281 and 
bake on jelly-cake pans, put two to ether 
with fruit jelly between. Make boiled 
custard. No. 136, put in a tin milk pan 
when cold and the cake in it. Have a 
cup of cream in a large bowl, flavored 
with vanilla. Serve spoonfuls of the 
cake and custard, and whip up the cream 
and serve a spoonful on top for a finish. 

928— Tapioca Jelly. 



4 cups water. 

% cup tapioca — 4 ounces. 



/J-? 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



I heaped cup sugar — lo ounces. 

I cup raspberry juice or syrup, or lemon 
juice and rind and water. 

Steep the tapioca in half the water two 
hours. The water should be cold but 
set in a rather warm place. Boil the 
other pint of water with the sugar in it 
and the raspberry or lemon syrup. Stir 
in the steeped tapioca and cook gently 
at the back of the stove until it is trans- 
parent, about half an hour. Pour into 
wetted cups or moulds; when cold and 
set turn it out and serve with cream or 
boiled custard. 

Pearl tapioca is the best; the coarse 
granulated if used should first be crushed. 

Cost : 8 cents a quart. 



929— Brandy Snaps. 



The name of a sort of molasses wafer, 
but there is no brandy about them, 
4 cups flonr — a pound. 
I cup butter — ^ pound. 

1 cup sugar— J4 pound. 

2 ounces ground ginger. 
Lemon extract to flavor. 

1 teaspoon soda — rounded measure. 

2 large cups common molasses — i^ 
pounds. 

Rub the butter into the flour as in 
making short paste, and add the ginger. 
Make a hole in the middle, put in the 
sugar, molasses and extract, dissolve the 
soda and put in, stir all together. 

Drop the batter with a teaspoon on 
baking pans, not greased, and bake in a 
slack oven. The snaps run out flat and 
thin. Take off before they get cold and 
bend them to tubular shape on a new 
broom handle.

930— Consnmme St. Xavier. 

^■^^""^" 

A brown vegetable broth with a kind 
of nudel paste m it. 

Make a good consomme as usual, with 
brown roasted chicken and beef in it if 
practicable or make good with meat ex- 
tract, and add to it a small portion of 
vegetables cut fine. 

Make a yellow egg batter about as stiff 
as for fritters, with 8 yolks, a spoonful of 
water and flour sufficient and add a 
small amount of minced parsley and 
salt. Let some one stir the consomme 
around while you pour the batter in a 
colander and let it drip through the 
holes into the consomme which immedi- 
ately cooks it in rounded lumps— an- 
other form of nudel soup. 

There is another way of reaching a 
similar result, that is by putting the yolks 
in a pan and carefully mixing flour with 
them with the finger tips while shaking 
the pan at the same time, making loose 
yellow crumbs of nudel dough, soft but 
separate, and then scatter them loosely 
into the boiling soup. American cooks 
call this "riffle soup." 

St. Xavier is the name of a place. 



931— Lake Trcut a la Genevoise. 



Fish baked in wine and served on toast 
in gravy. 

Take a 5-pound trout, cleanse and wipe 
dry ; score through the skin on both sides 



COOKING JFOR PROFIT. 



^33 



where the individual portions are to be 
taken off, and also sever the bone by 
striking the point of a knife through. 
Dredge salt and pepper in a buttered 
bakinG;-pan, put in the fish, a pint uf wine, 
an onion stuck with cloves, and bunch of 
parsley and thyme. Set in the oven and 
bake and baste the fish while baking very 
frequently. The gelatinous gravy from 
the^fish makes a glaze with the wine, 
which is to be coated over it by the bast- 
ing. When done, which should be in half 
an hour, take up the fish into a dish, 
pour a pint of broth in the pan and make 
gravy, thickening with brown roux, 
strain, skim, make pieces of toast, serve 
toast in each dish, well saturated with 
the sauce and a cut of the glazed fish 
upon it and round slice of lemon dipped 
in parsley dust on top. 

To serve whole in this style the head 
should be leit on and the fish should be 
brown and shining, and placed upon a 
large crouton foundation of fried bread 
cut to its shape and the wine gravy 
poured around with garnishments of 
lemon and special forms of potatoes and 
small croutons. 



932— French Potato Fritters or 
Beignets. 

This makes 25, small size for garnish- 
ing: 
12 ounces potato — 2 cups mashed. 
Y-z cup flour — 2 ounces 

2 tablespoons cream. 
Same of white wine or sherry 

3 eggs and 2 yolks 

Salt, nutmeg and cayenne. 

Take the potatoes from the dinner 
steamer and mash the required amount 
through a colander and while still warm 
mix in the other ingredients except the 
flour. 1 he mixture should be in a deep 
pan or saucepan and set in cold water. 

While it is cooling whip it light with 
an egg whisk, then stir in the flour. 

Drop small spoonfuls egg-shaped in 
hot lard, fry light colored, dram on pa- 
per, serve one in each plate of fish and 
with any dish that is a la Dauphinoise. 

Cost, about 10 cents for 25 fritters. 

933— Mutton Stew, a la Irlar.daise. 

The half-French bill-of-fare name for 



Irish stew. No. 60. But there can be 
beef stew a la Irlandaise as well as mut- 
ton ; it is beef stewed with potatoes, and 
a very cheap dish. It is good with to- 
matoes added, but then these stews have 
other names, for the original Irish stew 
lias no tomatoes, and some people, 
driven almost insane through everything 
that is brought to them in an hotel being 
flavored with tomatoes against their lik- 
ing, (the consequence of the indiscrimi- 
nate use of Spanish sauce), are glad to 
turn to it for relief, and hope it will al- 
ways keep its original character. In 
writing a bill of fare observe that when 
"a la' comes before a vowel, as in Irland- 
aise or a ritalienne or a TAndalouse — 
the second "a" is omitted, and the apos- 
trophe takes its place; but the full "a la" 
comes in before a consonant, like a la 
Richelieu. 



934— Macaroni a la Palermetane. 



The special name of the dish at No. 
65. Italienne is right, too, for it is a gen- 
eral appellation for any form of macaroni 
or Italian pastes. Palermetane means of 
the city of Palermo, in Italy, just as we 
might say Bostonian or Coloradan. 



935— Peaches with Rice, a la Rich- 
elieu. 

Prepare some cooked peaches in sjnup 
— a compote of peaches — and prepare 
some rice the same as for croquette or 
rice cake, that is, slightly sweetened and 
flavored, and with tne yolk of an egg or 
two in It. 

Dish up a spoonful of rice, smooth it 
around in the dish, place half a peach on 
top and pour syrup over it. It is a sweet 
entree like the fruit fritters, etc . 

936>St6wed Carrots. 



Scrape young carrots, split and divide 
in quarters lengthwise, boil or steam 
about an hour. Put them in butter 
sauce, cream sauce or plain butter only, 
changing the style on aifferent days. 

937— Huckleberry Roll Pudding, or 
RoiV-Poly. 

Make biscuit dough by the receipt at 



./ 



^34 



SAN liRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



No. 515, which is good for the purpose as 
it is,l3ut if you would have the dough so 
that it will peel apart in flakes after cook- 
ing, roll it out thin on the table, and 
spread a half-cup of lard or butter upon 
it; then fold it up and roll out twice. 
The last time of rolling out cover the 
sheet of dough with huckleberries (or 
other fruit) cut in two or three, roll up, 
put in pudding cloth, tie the ends and 
pin or sew the middle, and either drop in 
a roomy pot of boiling water or cook m a 
steamer. They cook in an hour or little 
more. Should be timed as they are not 
so good if kept long after they are done. 
Dip in water when taken up and the 
cloth will leave the pudding easily when 
unrolled. Serve with hard sauce or 
cream. 



938->Floating Island. 

It is a piece of cake floating in a bowl 
of boiled custard; the cake should be 
spread with fruit jelly and have a pile of 
whipped cream on top. Sponge cake 
and the varieties made out of the same 
mixture are the best to use. Several other 
trifles besides are called Floating Islands. 
Make two quarts of boiled custard and 
let it be ice-cold for use. Make sponge 
drops (round lady-fingers same as No. 4.) 
Spread with currant jelly, drop in the pan 
01 custard ; then serve m saucers or glasses 
with plenty of custard and whipped 
cream. Costs one cent a dish. 



939~-Corn Starch Jelly. 

Thb can be made Vv!ry good, if not 
spoiled by the use of too much lemon or 
too much starch. 

S cups water — a quart and a cup. 

1/^ cups sugar — 12 ounces. 

I small lemon. 

3 heaping tablespoons starch~3 ounces. 

Boil 4 cups water with the sugar in it, 
and juice of the lemon and half the rind 
cut in small shreds. Mix the starch with 
the other cup, and stir it into the boiling 
syrup. Let simmer about i^ minutes to 
become transparent and almost clear. 
Pour it into custard cups, or any kind of 
moulds. Serve in saucers with a s[)oonful 
of sweetened cream whipped to froth. 
Can be colored with burnt sugar or with 



iced fruit-juice. Cost : ij^ qts 12, cream 
5; 17 cents for eig hteen p ortions. 

They said they would come again and 
they are coming. Telegram for Mr. 
Farewell at 3 o'clock this afternoon ask- 
ing him to prepare a wedding breakfast 
for them for to-morrow at 11 : they to be 
married in the parlor of the hill cottage 
at 10. "Simple and informal; no fuss,*' 
the Colonel added at the bottom of his 
dispatch ; they generally say that, but are 
wofuUy disappointed it they don't find a 
fuss bsing made about their momentous 
proceedings. This is no way to do ; they 
ought to have given us time to send to 
the city for the ready-made decorations 
for the wedding-cake ; for floral designs ; 
paper cases for confections; there is no 
time for anything. Well, this means that 
somebody in this house will have to work 
all night, or nearly all, and the bride's 
cake will not be worth a cent to cut up, so 
fresh, scarcely cold unless made at once 
and set in the refrigerator. Wish I knew 
which is the winner in that match, the 
colonel or the banker's daughter — sup- 

Eose a novelist could tell plain enough » 
ut then it is none of our business ^ Any- 
thing for a change; however, I'm glad 
they chose this place for their^ breakfast. 
From the 1 1 o'clock train this morning 
Mr. Farewell brought over their Mary 
Jane, the one that cooks for them in their 
city house. He said that as but two 
weeks of the time now remains of the 
eight weeks for which I am engaged he 
should like his home cook to stay in the 
kitchen and try to catch on — I mean 
take items, and pick up ideas about cook- 
ing for the future benefit of his family 
and himself, if I was willing as of course 
I am. Said she is sadly deficient in the 
styles of putting food on the dishes, does 
not know how to make a good dish look 
good, much less how to make a common 
one look better than it is, and much 
more. I know whathe means, but he 
could not explain, neither can I — it is the 
trimming and shaping, flattening and 
squaring, the clean draining of the fries, 
the crispness, the gloss, the color, the 
garnishing. Now I shall tell her that 
looking on is all very well, but it is not 
equal to taking hold, and instead of sit- 
ting at the door she may take upon her- 
self to pick u|) something to make supi)er 
for the guests whilst I make the wedding-

Tl'.c confectioners and caterers fol- 



lowing a similar rule to the other em-

namentation of a cake about double the 
amount that they pay in wages for the 
time consumed; if a man to whom they 

§Vj three dollars a day consumes a whole 
ay in the elaborate decoration of a wed- 
ding cake the charge of the ornamenting 
alone will be about six dollars, and of the 
cake complete perhaps ten dollars. The 
same man may perhaps ornament a large 
number of cakes at Christmas or New 
Year's on each of which he will spend 
but half an hour, and the jjrice will be 
accordingly. The imported ornaments 
upon a fine cake may very likely swell 
the cost to twenty-five or fifty dollars.

The breakfast was set on the long ta- 
ble in large dishes, family style, though 
we did not send in all at once and of 
course the table was set out to the best 
advantage with the few ornamented 
dishes, glass and china and a few flowers. 
The marriage took place at half past ten 
and the carriages drove up to the door a 
few minutes later. The two principals 
in the business took very little lunch and 
that of the first division of the menu, the 
service froid; the bride cut the large cake 
in divisions which I had marked i)re- 
viously, to make it easy, and gave away 
the pieces, and it did not crumole much 
considering how newly made it was, but 
I had kept it almost frozen all night that 
it might cut well. The hostess did up 
the small cake, the four-pound one, and 
put it in one of their traveling satchels, 
then they got into the carriage and two or 
three others followed and were driven to

"the Glen," where they could catch a 
train at one o'clock. After they were 
gone the rest of the company went back 
to the table ; we served the lunch in good

did a little talking, too, I suppose.

made it their midday meal and it is fair- 
ly charged as ^ above, the three-dollar 
cake included in expense account with 
the manager. 



943— Boned Chicken with Truffles. 



Bone one fat young fowl and take the 
white meat of two more and mince it fine 
for stuffing. Put the minced chicken in 
a saucepan with the two ounces of but- 
ter, and about a third as much bread 
panada as there is meat ; add a slight sea- 
soning of herbs, salt and white pepper 
and two raw eggs and stir the whole over 
the fire until it is cooked to a smooth 
paste; then put in a small can of truffles 
whole or only the larger ones cut in two. 

Stuff the boned chicken with the mix- 
ture, sew up, lined in a cloth in good oval 
form, boil two hours and press between 
two dishes. When cold, brush over the 
outside with melted butter, cut two or 
three truffles in shapes such as round 
slices with crescents and dots on each 
side and decorate the surface of the fowl, 
place it on a dish ornamented with lemon 
slices and parsley and keep cold until 
wanted. Then slice thinly and serve 
cold. The truffles in the stuffing should 



show as they are sliced through in every 
cut. 

Cost: 3 fowls, 75; truffles 2 00, season- 
ings, garnish, 15 ; 4)2 90 for 20 to 25 slices. 



944 — lomatops in Iflayanaise. 

Pare good, smooth tomatoes with a 
verv sharp knife without scalding them 
and they will retain their crispness, which 
scalding destroys ; then slice each one in 
three or four. Lay three of these slices 
in a glass plate and place a teaspoon of 
mayonaise salad dressing (No. 151) upon 
each. Serve very cold. 

To serve these we covered two -large 
dishes with shred lettuce, set seven plates 
of tomatoes in each one and bordered 
them with small lumps of ice; placed 
them on table last thing before the meal 
began and removed them early. 



945— Ribbon Sandwiches. 



Cut thin slices of the finest and whitest 
bread of close grain and newly baked and 
remove the crust. Spread with potted 
ham or tongue, roll them up and tie them 
around with narrow satin riobon, making 
a neat true-lover's knot on each. Fold 
napkins fan-shaped for two dishes and 
pile up the rolled sandwiches in pyramidal 
torm. 



946— Lamb Cutlets, a la Maintenon. 



They are choice rib chops of lamb or 
mutton the bones scraped, half-cooked 
in a pan to shrink them, seasoned, 
spread on one side with a thick, white 
sauce, sprinkled with cut truffles baked in 
a buttered pan in the upper part of a hot 
oven to get a yellow-brown, served with 
paper frills upon the bones. The garnish 
for a breakfast dish may be a border of 
shapes of thin toast and for dinner a bed 
of peas or other accompaniment. To 
make the sauce, as good a way as any is 
to make a white roux of four ounces but- 
ter and the same of flour; and wh.n thev 
have been stirred over the fire until well 
cooked, add but half quantity of liquor 
(either broth or liquor from a can of 
mushrooms), which will be about two 
cups, and cook well with constant stir-

ring. Season with salt and white pepper, 
set the sauce away to get cold, then use it 
as ab ve named, spreading it thickly on 
the cutlets and smooth over with a wet 
knife before putting on the trfflues. 
Small triangles of thin toast are best to 
border a large dish as these cutlets must 
lie flat with the frilled ends outwards. 

Cost : 20 cutlets 60, truffles 1 00, sauce, 
etc., 20; $1 80. 

Named for Madame de Maintenon, a 
lady of the French court. 



947— Potatoes a la Baden-Baden. 



The same as No. 142; simmered in 
butter first, then drained and carefully 
baked to a yellow brown in the oven and 
sprinkled with parsley and fine salt. 

To serve them, fry a number of small 
lettuce leaves in lard or oil as you would 
fry Saratoga potatoes. The leaves should 
be of heart lettuce and be shell shaped. 
Out of the many, which take but a few 
minutes to fry, select the best, bronze- 
colored, dry and of good shade; drain 
them hollow side downward on a sheet 
of paper spread on a hot pan. Serve the 
potatoes in them set in individual dishes, 
and handed to each place as the cutlets 
are being passed from the large dish. 
Baden-Baden is a fashionable watering- 
place. 



948— Partridge Souffles in Cases. 

Roast three partridges, young guinea 
fowls or common chickens, pick off the 
meat without skin or tendons, mince it 
extremely fine and then pound to a paste 
and rub it through a sieve. This is a 
difficult matter to do with any but young 
and tender partridges or chickens and 
there ought to be a stone tnortar to pound 
the meat in. However, it can be done 
without by^ taking precaution not to try 
with eld birds. A souffle is a puff, and 
this mixture will not pufT if not quite a 
smooth paste. 

Make a thick butter sauce the same as 
for spreading cutlets a la Maintenon, 
with mushroom liquor, if convenient. 
Take i^ cups of the sauce to four cups 
of the chicken paste, season with salt, 
pepper, a slight grating of nutmeg and 
simc of lemon rind, add a spoonful of 



mushroom catsup and stir over the fire 
until boiling hot. Then set away to cool. 

Separate the whites and volks of eight 
eggs, whip them both light,' add the yolks 
to the mixture first, then the frothed 
whites. Put the souffle in twenty fancy 
paper cases, bake about 15 minutes, and 
send them in as soon as they are done, 
lor they faU as they become cool with 
waiting. Serve in the cases on large 
dishes with plates of buttered toast to 
follow. 

Cost: i^ lbs selected partridge meat 
60, sauce 10, eggs, seasonings 15, paper 
cases 25 ; $ r 10 for 20. Paper cases can 
be bought of confectioners or made at 
home. They hold about as much as a 
patty or gem pan and are of various 
shapes. 



949— White Coffee a la Soyer. 

Is made with coffee that, instead of 
being browned is only baked to a slight 
yellow color and is not ground, or at 
most the berries are onl)r bruised, and is 
made with one-half milk and one-half 
water. It requires twice as much coffee 
as the ordinary. 

For 8 cups take : 

2 cups light baked coffee berries. 

4 cups boiling water. 

^ cups boiling milk. 

The berries may have been parched 
before, but when wanted, heat them over 
again and throw them hot into the boiling 
water. Close the lid and let stand to 
draw for half an hour; then add the boil- 
ing milk through a strainer. Drop a ta- 
blesf>oon of whipped cream in each cup 
as it is carried in. 



950— Apricot (ce Cream 

5 cups cream. 

2 cups canned (or cooked) apricots. 

i/^ cups sugar. 

Pass the apricots without the syrup 
through a sieve. Freeze the cream and 
sugar first to guard against curdling by 
the fruit ; then add the apricot pulp and 
finish the freezing. 



951— Four Thousand Meals. 



So that couple got safely married and 



I3S 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



went away; still the number of guests in 
the house is steadily increasing. It seems 
almost a pity there was not a story teller 
here making a book out of what he saw, for 
it will be remembered, those young ladies 
from the Trulirural House never came 
over here to boaid until they saw the 
Colonel sailing around with his best girl ; 
and it stands to reason that there must 
have been unmeasured mischief m the 
air, and plotting and counter plotting; 
and alt that is lost. But every man to His 
trade, as the saying is. The way our 
part of the play comes in is just this : we 
have got things down to such a fine point 
by keeping tally this way that, after a lit- 
tle figuring in the spare hours of the re- 
maining two weeks, we shall all know ex- 
actly what it is going to cost that young 
couple to live, in whichever style, wheth- 
er in a soup-entree-and-dessert order of 
existence in a mansion on Euclid or 
Michigan Avenue or St. Charles or Sac- 
ramento street, or on bread and cheese 
and kisses a la mode on laborers' wages in 
Smoky Alley. Then we shall know how 
much Mrs. Tingee makes off her board- 
ers and shall see plainly how some people 
managed to get rich so quickly at the 
New Orleans Exposition, and, moreover, 
we shall know how to go about preparing 
a banquet for 4,000 people. 

For, wiih the wedding breakfast for a 
finish, the bell has sounded the call 130 
times and we have served 4,000 meals. 
The reasons are cogent for drawing the 
line at this even number: the stock of 
groceries laid in on a calculation for one 
month, which did not arrive until one 
week was past, has lasted one week over 
a month and is now exhausted. Mar- 
keting is beginning to come in from the 
farms at all sorts of irregular prices ; ap- 
ples, poultry, vegetables, all getting cheap 
but impossible to keep track of, and but- 
ter :and eggs correspondingly advanced ; 
in short wo have had a rare opportunity, 
it has been well improved and now the 
favorable conditions no longer exist. 



952— Review. 



In keeping the foregoing accounts of 
'-.est of dishes and meals there has been 
no attempt and no wish to argue that one 
style of living is better than another; 
those who must set out cheap meals will 



look at the comparative cost of dishes, 
taking notice at the same time of the 
number oi orders that can be served from 
them, and choose always to make those 
that are least expensive while others who 
furnish a complete hotel bill of fare will 
find an approximate figure to show what 
the expense ought to be. In this matter 
of meals and prices, too, instead of fic- 
ticiously changing and improving the 
summer boarding house and its facilities 
I have studiously represented it as it is 
with the restrictions as to markets, tlie 
lack of proper utensils, the scarcity of 
"help," and such things as usually fur- 
nish excuses for a poor table, because I 
believe this was a fair average of such 
houses and I did not want a model place 
to set up a pattern by. Our advantages 
lay in having express facilities and in be- 
ing in close proximity to a creamery and 
a cheese factory which established low 
pnces for dairy products and at the same 
time caused the offerings to be plentiful, 
the whole neighborhood being engaged 
in the milk business. This it will be seen 
was an important item, and still the 
greater number of country houses are as 
well fixed as we were ; it may be by keep- 
ing cows of their own, and most cf them 
have far better gardens. In counting 
the cost of soups I have first added to ihe 
price of steaks and roasts the loss of 
bones and trimmings, making meat that 
costs II cents at first rate at 15 or 20 
cents a pound when the net weight was 
reaohed, and then have valued these 
bones and cullings at about 2 cents a 
pound in soup; vegetables, quenelles, 
eggs, and all such ingredients have been 
duly allowed for. It did not prove feasi- 
ble to show some things in the wa)r of 
small economies such as every sensible 
cook puts in practice— how the cold rice 
left from a previous dinner and the can 
of peaches opened but scarcely touched, 
for the preceding supper become the 
"peaches a la Richelieu" of to-day's din- 
ner; or how the can of corn, too much 
yesterday, becomes the green corn friiiers 
on a new bill. I'hcrc has been greater 
watchfulness over the waste ^whilc this 
record was being kept, than would have 
been necessary' in the ordinary run of 
work, but otherwise all has been done 
according to common usage, and the 
Eums total will prove reliable daia for 
future calculations.

Dinner. 

August 14. 

Soup — Consomme Colbert (5 qts 24 
eggs 55 cents.) 

Trout wich Chili, Mexican style (4 lbs 
and sauce 50 cents.) 

Potatoes Chilian. 

Boiled ham (2 orders 4 cents.) 



956— Consomme Colbert. 

Clear consomme with small vegetables 
and green peas in it and a poached egg 
dropped in each plate when served. 
Make the consomme same as Bruno ise 
or jardiniere and have the eg2;s poached 
nearly hard, ready in a pan of hoc water, 
to dip up as wanted. 

Colbert was the name of a French 
statesman. 



957— Trout w.ih Chili, Mexican Style. 

The Mexican chili pepper is no stronger 
than curry powder. It is deep red, and is 
sometimes called sweet pepper and col- 
oring pepper; i:; much used in the South 
and 0/ the Creoles. 

Split open the fish, lay it white side up 
in a buttered baking pan, season wich 
salt, and dredge enough cniU pepper to 
color it red; pour a little broth if nec- 
essary to keep the corners of the pan from 
bummg. Bake the fish half an hour and 
serve with Spanish sauce in the dish or 
else with veal gravy and little tomato 
catsup added, and potatoes in some spe- 
cial form in the same plate. 



958— Potatoes, Chilian Style. 

Mashed potatoes sliced cold, like cold 



I40 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



mush to fry, the slices cut in. shapes, 
floured and sauted in oil or drippings. 
Season the potatoes when mashing with 
chili pepper as well as salt, and broth 
but no butter; rather soft that they may 
cake together well. The slices cut off 
can be cut in diamonds or in rounds with 
a small cutter. 



959— Stuffed K!utton, a la Soubise. 

Soubise always means with onions 
either white or brown. Take a shoulder 
and bone it. Cut 4 slices of bread in dice 
and throw them in a frying pan ; put in 
also a good-sized onion, cut up small, or 
a bunch of green onions, a spoonful of 
roast meat fat and same of water and 
pepper and salt to season. Stir over the 
fire till well mingled. Spread this stuffing 
over the mutton, roll up, and braise ten- 
der. 

Take 3 or 4 onions from the saucepan 
where they are cooking as a vegetable for 
dinner, mince and pass through a strainer 
and mix in sufficient brown sauce or 
gravy. 

Soubise has reference to a prince de 
Soubise who made an onion sauce. 



960— Saute of Chicken with Rissotto. 



Rissotto is rice; this is seasoned the 
Italian way with salt, cayenne, minced 
onions, ham and saffron, which makes it 
yellow. As saffron is not used and not 
wanted much in this country, a little cur- 
ry serves as a substitute. 

Chop 3 or 4 chickens into small pieces, 
saute them in a large frying pan and make 
a thicken2d gravy to them. Add mush- 
rooms if afforded. 

Fry some fat ham, minced onion in the 
fat, httle curry, broth to make gravy and 
put in boiled rice and stir up. 

Dish rice at one side of the dish and 
chicken at the other, or chicken in the 
middle and rice pressed into a patty pan 
to give it a shape and turned out into the 
dish of chicken. 



961— Krcmeskies a la Venitlenne. 

Minced meat rolled in thin bacon, 
dipped in batter and fried and ar«-^^ 
with white Italian sauce. 



Take the remains of cooked chicken, 
some of the livers and hearts cooked, 
and small quantity of lean ham, enough 
altogether to make two cups pressed, or a 
pound. Stir a teaspoonful each of butter 
and flour together over the fire and putin 
a half cup water or broth. Season rather 
highly with pepper, mushroom or wal- 
nut catsup^ thyme and grated lemon peel, 
add the minced chicken, which makes a 
stiff sort of sausage meat; set it away to 
get cold. When cool enough make in 
shape like corks of champagne bottles. 
Cut bacon slices as thin as possible ; roll 
up the mince in a slice of bacon, dip in 
batter and fry light colored. Serve with 
sauce. 



962— White Italian Sauce. 



Make butter sauce and use mushroom 
liquor from the cans instead of water. 
Let the sauce be rather thmner than the 
usual butter sauce. Slice button mush- 
rooms, about a dozen to a pint of sauce, 
and put in, and a spoonful of minced 
parsley. Same as Venetian sauce except 
the lemon juice. 



963— Corn in the Ear. 



Leave a few of the husks on the ears 
and drop them that way into a boiler of 
salted water. Boil about half an hour. 
When to be served take hold with a clean 
napkin and pull off husks and silk. Take 
a knife and cut out one row of grains by 
drawing the point down both sides ; then 
send in the ears. 



964 — Potato Cream Pie. 



3 large cups mashed potato — a pound. 

I cup sugar — ^4 pound. 

Small cup butter— 6 ounces. 

Seggs. 

'% cup milk. 

Flavoring of some kind.

them through a sieve ; mix the butter in 
while warm, then sugar, milk and flavor- 
ing. Separate the eggs and beat both 
yolks and whites guite light and stilf them 
::r just before baking. MaKes three me-

969— Cream of Barley Soap. 



It b puree of barley mixed with half 
stock and hall milk. 

Boil 2 cups pearl barley in plenty of 
water and strain the water away as it is of 
a dark color. Then put the barley into 
3 quarts of milk and cook at the back of 
the stove or set on bricks for an hour or 
more. Loil 4 quarts of stock with a cut- 
up carroi, onion, turnip and bunch of 
paraley in it. Pass the barley and milk 
through a strainer (fine or coarse accord- 
ing as you have time, for it is tedious), 
and mash the barley that remains with 
some stock to hasten the operation. 
Strain the seasoned stock into the barley 
puree, keep hot without boiling, add salt 
and white pepper and serve with crusts 
in the plates. A shorter way is to cook 
the barley tender, mash it to a paste and 
put it into the stock and milk without 
passing the barley through a sieve. In 
that case no crusts need be served as 
there will be barley grains in the soup.

SAN JPRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



970- Potatoes, Maitre d'Hotel. 

Pick out the smallest new potatoes, 
scrape or pare, and boil them. Drain 
away the water, put in a little fresh, and 
lump of butter, salt and a spoonful of vin- 
egar, and thicken slightly with flour ; boil 
up and lastly shake in a spoonful of 
chopped parsley. It is a thm, creamy 
sauce like Venetian, without mushrooms, 
and only enough to cover the potatoes. 



971— Pigeon or Squab Pie. 

Young pigeons, called squabs in this 
country, are pigeonneauxini^rench. The 
price varies greatly with locality ; we paid 
8o cents a dozen. This is a pie with 
brown gravy instead of white 's in chick 
en pie. 

Take 1 8 squabs, pick, singe, 9pen down 
the back, draw, and divide in halves; 
wash and dry them and flatten with the 
cleaver. Pepper, salt and flour them on 
both sides. Melt J^ pound of butter in 
the baking pan the pie is to be made in, 
lay in the squabs and ];)ake them light 
brown. Pour into the pan about 2 quarts 
of broth or water and continue tne bak- 
ing. When done sufiiciently thicken the 
gravy, add walnut catsup or a little Wor- 
cestershire sauce and salt and pepper, 
cover with a short crust and bake twenty 
minutes longer. When the crust of a 
meat pie gives out bti^fore the meal, bake 
a thin crust by itself on a baking pan ; cut 
it in squares and use to finish the. meal.

981— Consomme Claremont. 



^ Clear consomme, like ro^'al, with crisp 
light fried onipns in rings dropped in the 
plates. Having the consomme prepared 
and well flavored with meat extract and 
catsup, cut some onions in slices across 
and separate the slices into rings; throw 
these into a pan of flour and dust well; 
then into clean hot lard, and let fry yel- 
low and dry. Drain free from grease, 
and put a small proportion in each plate 
as served. It requires a little practice to 
fry onions this way successfully just as it 
does to fry Saratoga chips. Claremont is 
the name of a place and a palace. 



982— Pike, a la Qenoise. 



Place the fish in the baking pan with- 
out splittmg open, but scored across 
where the portions are to be taken off. 
Slice a small carrot, piece of turnip, an 
onion and stalk of celery into the pan, 
and cut a slice of fat salt pork and mix 
in. Add a bayleaf, salt, pepper and a 
pint of soup stock. Bake brown with fre- 
quent basting for over half an hour. Then 
take up the fish wi:h a fish-slice carefully 
into a dibh. Pour off the grease from the 
baking pan and put in a pint of stock 
a^ain, a spoonful of tomatoes or tomato 
catsup and }^ cup wine; let boil up till 
the fish glaze in the pan is all dissolved, 
thicken slightly and strain for sauce to 
the fish.

The common way. Cut raw potatoes

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



lengthwise in strips about the size of a 
little finger and fry in a kettle of lard. 

As fried potatoes are generally prepared 
in haste to order it should be remember- 
ed that they rise and float in the iat when 
done and the color they may take on in- 
stantly in fat that is too hot is no sign 
that they are not still raw and unfit to 
serve— wait till they float. 



984— Roast Guin3a Chicken. 



Young guinea fowls are more like par- 
tridges than like common chickens. Roast 
them in the usual way with a chicken 
stuffing, and serve currant or cranberry 
jelly in small saucers or chips separately. 

985— Collops of Beef, a la Mace* 
doine. 



broth and seasonings and let dry down 
until glazed. Serve cuts with Bordelaise 
sauce in the dish and ornamen. with 
shapes of fried bread. 



987~Bordelaise Sauce. 



^ Collops are sinall steaks. ^ Almost any 
piece of meat will do for this dish but the 
pieces must be sliced thin and trimmed 
to be nearly round. Flatten them with 
the cleaver, salt and pepper and flour 
them on both sides. 

Fry a minced onion in 4 spoonfuls of 
roast meat fat, and when it begins to 
color lay in the collops and brown them. 
Pour in a pint of water or stock, little 
Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper 
and let the collops continue stewing in 
the sauce until tender, the grease to be 
skimmed ofl'as it rises. I 

The Macedoine of vegetables cannot j 
be made to advantage without good green 
peas, either garden or French canned, as 
It is the mixture of colors of vegetables 
that make.' the dish a good one. Cut 

gieces of canot, turnip and other vegeta- 
les in dice and boil them ; mix a cupful 
of these with a cupful of green peas — as 
many peas as of tne others altogether — 
season with salt and butter, or some 
white sauce, dish up a spoonful of the 
Macedoine as a border, and a coUop 
glazed with its own thick sauce in the 
middle. 



It is brown sauce with minced garlic, 
ham, shalot, claret, cayenne and lemon 
juice. Take a few shreds of lean cooked 
ham — only enough for a flavoring— and 
mince and pound it fine, boil it in a pint of 
brown sauce or veal gravy, or use Spanish 
sauce if not too much tomatoes in it. 
Add while boiling a bay leaf, two or 
three cloves and a piece of mace and 
pinch of cayenne. In another saucepan 
put a tablespoon of minced young onion 
and a clove of garlic crushed and minced 
and a spoonful of oil, and stir over the 
fire to cook. Strain the seasoned brown 
sauce into it, and a cup of claret and let 
boil down, skimming off the oil and scum 
as it rises, and add lemon juice and a 
spoonful more wine to brighten it by 
causing more scum to rise. Bordelaise 
means of Bordeaux, the part of France 
whence claret wine comes. 



988— Calf's Head Fried in Batter. 

Boil a calf's head and save the liquor 
for soup. Take out the bones, put the 
meat in; press between 2 dishes. A 
calf's head generally requires one hour's 
boiling but large ones may take two 
hours. 

When the head is cold take half and 
cut in narrow slices about finger size, salt 
and pepper them, dip in thin batter same 
as kromeskies or fritters and fry light-col- 
ored. Serve sauce in the dish and the 
meat in it but not covered. 



986— Epigramme of Lamb, Bordelaise. 

Divide the breasts of lamb or mutton 
in strips by sawing through the bones, 
cook them in a deep baking pan with 



989— Cut-off Corn. 

Boil roasting ears half an hour; then 
shave the corn off the cob and season it 
the same as canned com with butter, salt 
and milk.

991— Baked Farini Puddirg. 

8 cups milk — 2 quarts. 

I heaped cup farma— 7 ounces. 

Small cup sugar — 6 ounces. 

54 cup butter— 4 ounces. 

5^ eggs (or 8 yolks.) 

Boil the milk with the sugar m it, and 
sprinkle in the farina dry, beating all the 
while with the wire and egg whisk as if 
making mush. Let the farma cook slow- 
ly half an hour or more, then mix in the 
butter and beaten eggs. Serve with 
sauce. Cost : 30 cents for 5 pints or 35 
to 40 orders. 

992~-Blueberry Shortcake. 



Average cost i y^ cents each person 
each meal; giving half a pint of milk and 
a gill of cream to each person — some of 
it used in the cooking and ice cream, 
however. 



Made the same way as strawberry 
shortcake and others as at No. 397. Pick 
over the blueberries, mix a cup of sugar 
in two quarts, and stir them about enough 
to draw juice to disiolve the sugar. 
Spread on split shortcakes, made large 
but thin, cut in eighths and serve with 
cream. 

993 -Chocolate Cup Custard. 

Make same as boiled custard, No, 1^6, 
and add a tablespoon of grated common 
chocolate. An ounce of chocolate is 
sufficient for that quantity of custard 
trebled, and serves for the orders of 40 
persons. The surplus chocolate thai was 
too much for breakfast, can sometimes be 
utilized in this way. A flavoring of va-

996- To Save Twenty Do.lars a 
Week. 



The above is a fraction — about the 
ninth of a cent over 10 cents a meal 
average, including the extravagance of 
the i6-cent and 17-cent dinners, the ^4- 
cent wedding breakfast and the birth day 
suppers. 

That is an expense of 30 cents a day 
for each person, or $2.10 a week, for liv- 
ing on the fat of the land and having 
choice of nearly all the desirable dishes 
with milk and cream without stint and 
first quality of butter, coffee and bread. 
It does not seem very high, not even when 
the additional expenses are added. Yet 
as an incentive to carefulness it should 
be borne m mind that a saving of but 
one cent a meal on 4,000 will yield 40 
dollars ; it reduced by 2 cents 80 dollars 
will be saved and if the meals can be 
held down 3 cents, or at 7 cents a meal 
there will be a savmg over our figures of 
120 dollars, or for 6 weeks a saving of 20 
dollars a week on provisions alone. This 
is why it pays to give good wages to a 
cook who knows how and is willing^ to 
keep down the expenses hy avoiding 
waste and profusion. The dinners can 
be kept down to 10 cents and breakfasts 
and suppers to 6 cents and the average of 
7 cents all around will easily be main- 
tained; that is 21 cents a day for each 
person or about $1 50 a week. As a rule

Total, $7 48; 52 persons; 1454 cents 
a plate. 



SBT—Polage Alexandrina. 

It is a vegetable puree soup spotted 
with a jardiniere of mixed vegetables 
cooked separately. Set the strained soup 
stock over the fire with a cup of raw rice, 
a quart of green peas, a large turnip, 
squash, celery, kohl-rabi, leaks and 
onions, all in smaller quantity than the 



peas, and a piece of lean salt pork. 
Cook the vegetables soft, then pass them, 
the rice, and the stock together through 
a strainer. It is like green peas soup. 

Prepare a small quantity of carrot, 
turnip and parsnip, or scjuash or other 
vegetables cut in small dice, and boiled 
separately, a spoonful of green peas or 
flageolets or haricots verts, and mix in 
and season to taste. 



998 -Whitefish a la Cardinal. 



Lay the fsh open in a baking pan, 
spread over with lobster paste made the 
same as for lobster croquettes, dredge a 
small amount of cracker dust on top and 
bake, basting once with butter. Serve 
cuts with cardinal sauce in the dish, and 
some special form of potatoes. 

999— Cardinal Sauce. 

Anything a la cardinal may be expected 
to be red or have red ornaments. Cardi- 
nal red being the color of the robe worn 
by the Cardinals on State occasions. 

Make butter sauce and make it red or 
at least pink with pounded red lobster 
meat and shrimp passed through a seive, 
add cayenne and lemon juice io this 
sauce. Lobster coral — the roe — is used 
for this purpose where it can be obtained. 



1000— Potato Crulls. 

There are small machines of the apple- 
parer class, which cut potatoes in spiral 
shavings called crulls or curis. Fry these 
in the usual way of fried potatoes, dram, 
dust with fine salt; serve one with each 
plate of fish. ♦ 

1001— R:ast Pork, a I'Anglaise. 



Pork with sage and onions. 

Take the bone out of a shoulder or loin 
of pork. Mince a large onion, throw it 
in a frying pan with a spoonful of fat, 
and stir it over th^ fire ; put in a table- 
spoonful of powdered sage, some salt and 
pepper. Spread the minced onion upon 
the meat and put some in the cavity 
where the bone was taken out; roll up, 



COOKING J^OR PROFIT. 



W 



tie with twine, roast in a pan till well done. 
Take up, pour cfif the fat and make gravy 
in the pan with water added to the sea- 
soned glazed that remains, or else pour 
brown sauce in and let it boil up. Stir 
in a tablespoon of made mustard, and 
strain the sauce. 



1002- Veal Cu.let?, a la Maintenon. 

Cut veal steaks from the best part, 
(using the remaining pieces for stews) 
very thin and about two and a half inches 
wide. Make a well seasoned mince like 
that for kromeskies. No. 961 ; or chicken 
croquette mixture. Spread the mince 
on the cutlets, roll them into a cushion 
shape, place close together in a buttered 
pan, pour a few spoonfuls of seasoned 
broth and mmced mushrooms and pars- 
ley in the spaces ; sitt cracker dust on 
top, and bake about half an hour. 

Serve with a brown sauce poured un- 
der and garnish with croutons and lemon 
slices dipped in parsley. 



1003— Calves' 3rains in Batter, Re- 
moulade. 



Boil the brains, perhaps those saved 
from one calf s head will be enough to 
fill the bill; and when cold cut in small 
pieces and put them in a dish of vinegar 
and water with salt and pepper. When 
to be cooked again drain the pieces, roll 
in flour, then dip in thin fnlter batter 
and drop into hot lard. Fry light-color- 
ed and serve with remoulade sauce. 



1004— Farina Fritfers. 



Make farina cake or pudding and let it 
become cold, then slice it in long but 
narrow pieces, dip in egg and cracker 
meal and fry brown. Roll the fritters in 
powdered sugar and serve without sauce. 
The sugar may be flavored by grating 
lemon or orange rind into it, or dropping 
vanilla extract and stirring it about. 



1005— Fi id Carrots. 

Cut in long strips, boil in water, drain. 



salt well, shake about in a pan of flour 
and fry the same as fried potatoes. 

1006— Grated Crn. 



Boil ears of green corn and grate off 
the cob instead of cutting as for cut-off" 
corn. Season the grated corn with but- 
ter, salt and a spoonful or two of cream, 
and serve as a vegetable same as Summer 
squash. 



1007 -Queen Cakes. 

Queen cake is the best white cake with 
sultana raisins, citron and currant ; a fine 
white fruit cake. 

Make the best white cake. No. 622 ; 
and add about a cupful of each of the 
fniits. The greenest new-made citron 
should be chosen as it looks better in the 
cake than the dark pieces. Can be 
baked in one mould, or this way : 

Having made the cake mixture put it 
in small muffin pans or gem pans to 
bake, and frost the tops when done. 

Costs a trifle more than other kinds, 
chiefly because it takes more weight to 
serve small cakes frosted to each order 
than in slices. 



1008— Baked Cabinet Pudding. 



It is made with slices of cake and 
citron in small slips ; custard poured over 
and baked, and then frosted on top like 
lemon pie. 

Take slices of cake of any sort, but 
sponge cake is the best, and enough to 
half fill a three-quart pudding pan. 

Place one layer of cake in the pan and 
drop in bits of butter and shreds of 
citron, another layer on that and butter 
and citron again. 

Mix three eggs in four cups of milk — 
no sugar needed — and flavor with grated 
lemon rind and juice. Pour it over the 
cake in the pan, cover with a sheet of 
buttered paper, bake about half an houf . 
Frost over with four whites whipped up 
firm, and four tablespoons sugar stirred 
in. Serve with sweetened cream. 

Costs twenty-nine cents for four pints 
without frosting or sauce, but it uses up 
dry slices of cake at full value. Brandy

is added to this pudding when it is 
wanted richer. 



1009— Pineapple Cream Pie. 

I quart pineapple — 2 cans. 

ijl cups sugar — 12 ounces. 

I cup cream. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

If fresh pineapple grate it ; if cans save 
the juice for sauces and mince the fruit 
first and then mash it, and stir it over the 
fire in a saucepan with the sugar for a few 
minutes ; add the cream and the yolks 
well beaten and fill into small, open 
pies, these mixtures being richer than 
ordinary fruits. The same mixture stir- 
red over the fire after the yolks are added 
makes a rich pineapple conserve for 
spreading on layer cakes and filling tart- 
lets. Use the whites of eggs for frosting 
cabinet pudding and in the sherbet. 

Cost, according to pineapple, probably 
sixty cents for four pies.

1010— How Much They Eat. 



To serve four thousand meals required 
solid food as follows : 
Flour and meal 603 pounds made 

into bread and pastry was, say 800 lbs 
Oatmeal and wheat 62 pounds 

made into mush was say 150 '* 

Rice, tapioca, starch, beans, 28

Total 4227 lbs 

That is about 1 pound and ^ ounce 
to each person each meal. Discarding 
the fractions and leaving the 227 pounds 
to represent the waste left on the plates, 
we have one pound of solid food as the 
reauirement for each person three times 
a day. We are dealing now with aver-

Total, $8 13; 54 persons; 15 cents a 
plate. 



1013— Fried Panfish, a la Margate. 

Dip small fish in flour and fry in a pan 
of hot lard. 

To garnish, have ready a pint of young 
green peas, fry them in lard or clear but- 
ter, not too hot, until they are dry but 
very bright green, like parched peas in 
taste. Shake them up m a little fresh 
butter and serve a spoonful around the 
fish. Margate is a pleasure resort and 
fishing place. 



1012—Consomme Paysanne. 



Clear consomme with vegetables like 
jardiniere and Brunoise but the specialty 
of shred cabbage in addition. Paysanne 
means peasant-county style. For the 
vegetables take the smallest vegetable 
spoon and scoop out carrots, squash, 
turnips of two colors, or whatever may be 
available in the vegetable line, size of 
peas, boil them along with a handful or 
two of cabbage shred fine as if for slaw ; 
draw away the water when done, and put 



1014— Potatoes Stuffed. 

Select medium potatoes all of one size 
and cat off the ends and bake. When 
the potatoes are done scoop out_the in- 
side, mash and season, then put it back 
into the shells, set them on end in the 
baking pan and keep m the oven till 
wanted. Serve with fish but on a separate 
plate or dish. 



1015— Chicken Pot Pie, Country Style. 

Cut up five fowls in joints and boil in 
water barely enough to cover, and time 
according to age. Old fowls make good 
pies if allowed two or three hours to stew 
tender. Add a seasoning of sa t pork 
and onion, parsley, salt and pepper. 
When done add milk to make sauce suf- 
ficient, thicken till like thin sauce and 
turn the stew into a pan that will go in 
the oven. Make up pot pie dumpling 
batter as elsewhere directed, drop spoon- 
fuls all over the surface and bake twenty 
minutes or more. 



1016— Sma I Fillets of Beef, a la 
Creole. 



Small beefsteak pieces sauteed and 
stewed tender and put in tomato sauce. 
To saute the meat put in the frying pan 
first a minced onion and piece of garlic 
along with butter or oil, and thin pieces 



^50 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



of steak on top. When the onion and 
steaks begin to brown, add soup stock in 
small quantity and put on the lid and 
keep it simmering. Fill up with tomato 
sauce, or Spanish sauce with tomatoes 
added, just before time to serve. Gam 
ish with croutons of fried brfead. 



1017— Grated Corrr Pudding. 

Grate cooked corn off the cob ; to a 
quart add four yolks eggs, half cup of 
milk, half cup of butter, salt and pmch 
of white pepper. Put in a tin pan and 
bake. Serve as a vegetable, a spoonful 
in a small dish. 



1018— Browned Garrots. 

Steam or boil first ; put the carrots in a 
pan in the oven with a spoonful of roast 
meat fat and bake brown. Dredge salt. 



1019— Steamed Cabinet Puddings. 



Individual; in custard cups. 

Take as many slices of cake as will fill 
a two-quart pan. 

y^ cup butter. 

^ cup citron shred fine. 

6 cups milk. 

8 eggs. 

J^ cup currant jelly. 

Spread the slices of cake one side with 
butter the other with jelly, very tliinly ; 
put three or four together cut in dice, 
mix the shred citron with the cake and 
fill custard cups or deep muffin pans. 
Mix the egG^s and milk together— no 
sugar needed— and pour over the cake, 
press down with a teaspoon after it has 
soaked a short time, then steam about 
half an hour. 

Turn the puddings out in saucers to 
serve, and there ought to be either a 
spoonful of whipped cream or egg mer- 
ingue on top and the meringue browned 
with a red hot shovel held over it. 



1020— Sliced Sweet P^tat) Pie. 

Steam a few sweet potatoes and let get 
cold. Roll out four or five pie crusts, 
slice the sweet potatoes thin and lay in 



slices enough to a little more than cover 
the bottoms. Strew in sugar enou :h t^ 
cover the potato slices, and then half a 
dozen bits of butter size ot filberts and on j 
blade of mace broken up in each pie. Pour 
in a quarter cup of wine, or brandy and 
water and bake without a top crust slowly 
and dry. 

1021— Cocoanut Ma aroons. 



Make as at No. 457 ; but use desiccated 
cocoanut instead of almonds. When 
you have cake icing left over it can be 
used to advantage in this way. 



How V.uch tD Serve, 



It is needless to ofier Mrs. Tingee the 
advice to dish up light as her failing is 
in that direction already ; I have seen her 
serve portions to her best boarders that I 
should consider only the scrapings of the 
dishes, and have seen her boarders, not 
caring to touch the blackened scraps of 
meat which she set before them for tea, 
make the repast of two thin slices of 
baker's bread and butter and a cup of 
weak tea with apparent content. I can 
only account for their staying to board at 
such a table by supposing that there were 
other reasons stronger than the love of 
eating which prevented them from ex- 
ercising a free choice and going some- 
where else. But in nearly all more open 
and public houses the failing is in quite 
the opposite waj^. To hear the waiters in 
many places trying to cajole or bully the 
cooks into dishing up two or three pounds 
to each person one would think their iove 
for those they wait on is stronger than a 
brother's, ana that their scnsiuveness at 
the disgrace of only taking a man just 
what he can eat and nothing to^ waste 
ought to excite our most sympathetic con- 
sideration. There are young proprietors 
and managers, too, working for popu- 
larity who make mistakes in this line It 
may be good policy in some circumstances 
to make a show of that sort of liberality 
which gives three times as much as the 
average man or woman consumes; in 
such a case let it be breads and vege- 
tables that are condemned to be thrown 
away, and always serve the meats small. 

As some have but little idea of quantities 



COOKING JFOR PROFIT, 



15^ 



in pounds and ounces, let us observe that 
ten eggs are a pound and two eggs are 
three ounces, and enough for nearly every 
person. If we should set five dishes of 
eggs each containing two fried, it would 
certainly look like a profuse allowance, 
yet there would only be the alloted pound. 
Take away a dish and replace it with one 
of meat same weight ; take away another 
and give potatoes or fried oysters, fish, 
or mush of its weight ; take another and 
give bread, and take the fourth and bring 
m its place batter cakes and there is but 
the allotted pound of solids yet, although 
a good and complete meal. These things 
are worth considering b;:cause thejr are 
related to the difficulty there is of living 
in this world, for it is not what we eat but 
what we waste that makes board so high. 
A man in business ought to have tact 
enough to relax a rule in economy at the 
right time but some have not. I stopped 
somewhere recently where they only 
served one egg to a dish, with small 
piece of ham. I have forgotten where it 
was but as there is no unpleasant im- 
pression attached to the remembrance it 
must have beeji a good table with enough 
of other things, where nobody was dis- 
pleased, and certainly at our Summer 
house at Unitah Lake, where there was 
no Lt ntor restraint, about half the orders 
that '-ame were for one egg only, but eggs 
are staple and common and that does 
not excuse the mistake of old Mr. Stick- 
tite at his Union Depot Hotel at Jimson- 
vale with his asparagus. When the 
crowd of passengers looked over his bill 
of fare and snw "asparagus," notprmted 
but written in, they looked around and 
at each other as if to say, "What a lib- 
eral man," and "What an excellent din- 
ner we shall have." But when it was 
brought in, three poor little infant stalks 
counted without a miss to each plate 
the s.i.timent changed to a dry little 
lau^h and all fell to finding fault in- 
discriminately wiih everything on the 
board. The dinner would have been 
well enoui^h without the asparagus; it 
was not expected; why did he have it? 
For poi;ularity, or course ; to make peo- 
ple say he was liberal, but he failed 
through not giving enough ; it did more 
harm than good. So it was at the Hotel 
Kaniastic at Fantastic Beach, when they 
uud to Live a i i.^h-toned Sunday dinner 
N.iui l.u\i;.d fillet of beef and cooked one 



fillet, foiur pounds, for near a hundred 
people. Your guests who can afford to 
pay three or four dollars a day are likely 
to be aware of the merits of the tender- 
loin, at least these were, and everybody 
ordered it, so altogether it was shaved off 
in slices as thin as card board and all the 
first half were thereby made as mad as 
high-toned people dare to get, the other 
half got none at all and I don't know which 
end thought they were the worst treated, 
but probably the hotel lost custom enough 
to have paid for several fillets. If I were 
giving spring chicken for breakfast for 
the fust time in the season notwithstand- 
ing the two-ounce rule in all else I would 
give half a pound of chicken to every 
order, drop off all other kinds of meat for 
that meal and give the other half pound 
in the best of breads and sauce and trim- 
mings to the chicken.

calf s head cut in dice in it and a small 
proportion of tomatoes. 



1023— Perch Water Souchet. 



A water souchet— -called "souchy" by 
English cooks— is fish steaks or fillets 
stewed in a very little water with herb 
seasonings and served on toast with some 
of the broth over the toast. 

Slice the fish if large or split and cut in 
quarters if small, lay the pieces in a 
bright pan with a small bunch of parsley 
and green thyme and two or three green 
onions ; add salt and pepper to season, 
fill up with water enough just to cover the 
fish and stew gently at the side of the 
range about half an hour, skimming off the 
scum that rises. Take out the herbs and 
•onions and serve the fish from the pan on 
slices of buttered toast moistened with 
the fish liquor.

salt, cayenne and juice of half a lemon.

cold make it in small cutlet shapes, egg 
and bread them, fry light colored in k 
kettle of lard. Boil four or five eggs hard

1027--Green Corn Pudding. 

Shaved cooked com off the cob, or 
use canned com pounded to a half- 
paste. To a quart add one cup milk, 
naif a cup butter and four egg^s and salt 
j and white pepper to season. Bake in a 
puddinsc pan ; serve as a vegetable entree 
m flat dishes. This can be made much 
richer if wanted so, with more milk and 
yolks of eggs and is a very popular dish. 



Parisienne potatoes in yellow sauce. 
Steam or boil the potatoes without break- 
ing. Make butter sauce, add to it the 
yolk of an egg, salt, .white pepper and 
juiceof half a lemon. Put the potatoes 
m the sauce ; serve with fish. 



1023— Chicken Giblefs Saute, with 
Rice. 



Cut the giblets in small pieces all of 
one size and steep in cold water. Fry a 
minced onion in ham or bacon fat, then 
put in the giblets and fry (saute) them 
Brown. Put in water lo nearly cover, 
season with powdered herbs or Worcester- 
shire sauce, salt and pepper, and let stew 
with a lid on till quite tender, then skim 
and thicken the sauce and serve with rice 
in the dish like a curry. 



1026— Lobster Cutlets, a la Victo ia. 



Take half a can of lobster and pound 
it to a paste. Put in a saucepan, half a 
cup butter and one small cup flour and 
stir them over the fire and when hot and 
well mingled, add a cup of boiling broth 



1028— Boiled Sago Pudding. 

4 cups milk. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 

1 cup sago. 

Butter size of an egg. 

2 eggs or the yolks only. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it, shake 
in the sago and keep it stirred up for a 
few minutes, let cook slowly with the lid 
on for about half an hour, set where it 
will not burn on bricks at back of the 
range. Then beat in the butter and 
eggs. Serve with sauce. 



1029— Work and Wages. 

Counting up to the 13th of August 
we only had an average of twenty -three 
paying people in the house including the 
owner and his familv. Mrs. Tingee and 
her two or three girls, and a boy in the 
yard could take care of that numbe- 
easily ; but it has to be according to style. 
There is the Summerland House at Uni- 
tah running half the time with but seven- 
ty-five paying people and eighty-five 
"help." At this house we are oetween 
styles and have nine employes to the* 
average ♦^wenty-three guests, and some-

times have ten. There is a fraction of a \ 
person somewhere, perhaps that is the 
Baby, but we will not let fractions trouble 
us when tney are but small, so of the 
four thousand meals consumed eleven 
hnndred and thirty-four have gone to the 
help and the twenty-three guests have 
to pay for them as well as the two thous- 
and eii^ht hundred and ninety-ei.^ht 
meals for themselves, all at ten cents a 
meal, discard in.:::^ the ninth of a cent frac- 
tion as usual ifor the sake of lucidity. 
Besides this co.nes the wa^es paid for 
carrying on the work of the place to 
swell the expense account to nearly 
donble. As most people are sensitive on 
the subject of the amount ot compensa- 
tion they can command, I will not "give 
away" anybody but will give the sum 
total for the bunch of us. There was 
one whom I have reason to suppose took 
his li^ht employment as the price of his 
board during his Summer vacation, and 
cost the house nothing in cash ; another, 
perhaps, had his compensation contin- 
gent upon the amount of the profits ; two 
of the workers were hired by the year at 
country wa^es, and the girls who did the 
table waiting were at the usual house- 
girl prices. The cook for this short sea- 
son received as much pay as the chief 
cook at the best of the two hotels at the 
depot and a little more than the chief 
cook at Black's, which was a fancy price 
for this small house to pay, yet neither 
of those chief cooks would nave taken the 
situation or done the work because it is 
mixed, both meat and pastry, and be- 
cause it is mixed other ways; tor there 
are some things which look natural 
enough but which it is impossible for a 
limited and graded, bound and restricted, 
enthralled and restrained cook to do. 
I don't know why the French cooks sim- 
ply say it is m\\:^os-seebLe for them to 
do so and that is all there is of it — as, for 
instance, it is quite possible for fishes to 
fly, I have seen them do it in the tropics, 
but it is impossible for the chief cook of 
a full-grown hotel to clean fish, and 
equally impossible for his second cook to 
pass dirty dishes* over to tne next table, 
however much they may be in his way on 
his own table, — it isn't his business to 
gather up dishes. 

These impossibilities often cause em- 
barrassment in small houses where per- 
haps there is not yard-man enough to go 
droun, or where, it may be, there is no 



yard man but the proprietor or his clerk, 
and as they will not clean the fish for the 
cook and the cook cannot cook it with- 
out being cleaned of course there is 
nothing for that cook and his second to 
do and they step out. The small houses 
then hunt up a woman cook, for they 
are generally more pliable ; they either do 
not know of those iron-clad rules of the 
kitchen, or, knowing them, with the nat- 
ural mulishness of woman they choose 
to do the other way and go right on 
earning the wa2:es. There are said to be 
a few first-class female cooks getting as 
high wages as the same grade of male 
cooks. Without the least intention of 
saying what ought to be and only stating 
facts the highest wages I have ever known 
a woman to receive for cooking in a small 
hotel both meat and pastry, was fifty dol- 
lars a month. There are thousand of 
them working in hotels and boarding- 
houses at five dollars a week, whose work 
is but little above common labor. There 
is no doubt but there is a demand for 
skillful, bill-of-fare, women cooks; such 
can always secure good situations with 
sufficient help at about ten dollars a week 
in any part of this country, board and 
lodging, of course, in addition. It is on 
that figure I will base future estimates of 
the cost of board in country houses. 
In the present instance, however, I have 
the actualities to draw froni and find that 
the sum total of wages paid for the six 
weeks was three hundred and twelve dol- 
lars. 



1030— Laundry Work. 

The washing of table cloths and nap- 
kins is an expense large enough to change 
the grade of the house that cannot a.^ord 
it from the one that can ; it must be paid 
for by the boarders and consequently af- 
fects the price of board. In such a house 
as the one we write of, however, it is not 
practicable to make a separate account 
of it. Good hotel managers expect the 
i money earned by the laundry to pay its 
I way and pay for the laundry work of the 
house ; probably such was the case here 
and it need not affect our estimates. 



1031— Fuel and Light. 

This item I could not get with perfect

exactness but can approximate closely. 
Our John has it as part cf his yearly con- 
tract that he shall in Winter provide 
twenty cords of wood for the Summer 
business. He claims that he had this 
Spring twenty-two cords, and having but 
seven cords left we must have used fifteen 
cords in six weeks. That includes the 
laundry and dining-room f res, and allow- 
ance has to be made for the wood being 
at least half of it dry and decaying bass- 
wood that bums away like paper. Of 
such wood in six weeks we may have 
burned enough in the kitchen to be 
equivalent to eight cords of sound wood 
worth in the country three dollars a cord 
or twenty-four dollars. 

The house has consumed twenty-five 
gallons of coal oil of which the dming- 
room and kitchen cannot have used more 
than lo, or $2 worth. 



1032-lce, 



Mr. Farewell has contract with one of 
the neighbors, by which he hauls all the 
ice he needs for the season from said 
neighbor's ice-house for a compensation 
of $15. All the ice used for freezing 
creams has been allowed for in counting 
cost ; for this portion of the season allow 
for ice otherwise used $10. 



1033— Total Cost of Board. 



Provisions for 23 boarders 42 days $290.70 

Wages of employes 6 weeks 312.00 

Provisions for employes 42 days 113.67 
Fuel, light, ice 36.00 



Total...... $752.37 

This is within a fraction of 26 cents a 
meal for the paying people and is $5.45 
a week each as the actual cost of hrst- 
class board and middle-class table ser- 



vice. 



1034— How Much Profit? 



This house charges $10 a week for 
board and lodging, transient meals are 
50 cents and therefore average half profit, 
while there is a margin on regular board- 
ers of $4.55 a week each and a total of 
$627 63 for the six weeks, or over $100 
a week out of which to pay the bed rooms 



and rent, the laundry and chamber work 
having already been paid for in this 
estimate, which includes the help em- 
ployed. The latter part of the season is 
the best; there are now in the house 40 
boarders to 11 "help," yielding a profit 
of $182 a week. If a man can have a 
season of only 10 weeks at that average 
and these prices he makes $1,820 out of 
a small house; a sum large enough to 
tempt many to try the business. The 
owner of the place and his family are 
properly counted as boarders in every 
calculation of expense, having placed the 
manager and housekeeper in position to 
relieve them from any active participation. 

If the manager and housekeeper were 
to get married and, with this book for 
their guide, were to become the landlord 
and landlady of the house they would 
have a still better rate of profit to expect 
than the figures above, for thty would 
have in adcfition the salaries which they 
now enjoy, to go a long way towards 
paying their rent. 

The cost of sleeping people consists 
chiefly in the laundry work involved in 
changing the bedding'after every sleeper. 
Two sheets, a pillow slip and one or two 
towels are expected to^ be washed after 
every departure, which, put out at 
schedule rates would cost 35 cents for a 
bed that only yielded 50 cents. For 
regular boarders the changes are made 
only twice or it may be once a week ex- 
cept towels, and reason is found in that 
for making a difference in rates for regu- 
lar and transient. The cost of laundry 
work has also to be reduced to the 
smallest sum by having it done at home.

1041'How Many Cooks to How 
Many People? 



My second used to do up her hair one 
day with blue ribbon and the next day 
with pink, in the old happy days five or 
six weeks ago when there was nobody in 
the house, and singing began and ended 
the day ; now the boat boy never comes 
to turn the ice cream freezer; nobody 
has time to help her and she wears no 
more ribbons; she has soured on the 
work and gets mad if I call her "sec." 
All hotel hands are working under a 
heavy pressure now, at the busiest time 
of all; there is no getting help when 
every hand is already at work that can 
be found. At various times it has fallen 
to me to take charge of a kitchen for a 
fixed sum and pay all the other hands 
myself, when the fewer I had to help me 
the more money I had left. For such 
times I had a rule formulated that i 
cook and i helper are required for 25 peo- 
ple, and I more for every 25 additional, 
and at this late day I find no reason to 
change the estimate. This has reference 
only to the work of hotels or houses where 
regular meals are prepared after the style 
of these present. ^ There are places where 
one man will go into the woods and cook 
for a hundred wood-choppers or saw-mill 
hands, and carry his water and split his 
wood besides, but there is little in that 
for a comparison. It is the commonest 
possible mistake to suppose that because 
there are few people there is but little 
work; it is the number of dishes made 
and not the number of people that makes 



IS6 



SAN JPRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



the work. It does not take much longer 
to make 2 gallons of soup than i. If I 
have 5 sauces to make it is immaterial in. 
point of time whether they be 5 cups or 
K quarts. Where the number of people 
does make a difference is in the duration 
of meals, breakfast encroaching upon 
dinner and giving no time to the one 
cook to begin his preparations at the 
proper season for the next meal, then 
another has to take hold of the lag- 
ging breakfast orders and give him his 
opportunity. The time when the pay- 
master reaps a temporary advantage is 
when the 25 gradually swell to 40. There 
is a disinclination to take on another 
cook or helper, the 2 are in harness and 
are making the work go on, in part from 
the force of habit, but it is on a strain 
and by neglecting the small niceties, by 
failing to clean up, and by letting thingsgo 
withount the finishing strokes. It will be 
found a ^ood rule to count by, that 2 
skilled cooks and a pan-washer helper 
are required to cook for 50. 



1042— Puree a la Crecy, or Carrot 
Soup. 

Crecy, an old French battlefield, after- 
wards turned into market gardens be- 
came noted again for the production of 
the carrot, a vegetable more highly val- 
ued before the introduction of the beet 
than it is now, but still one of the main- 
stays of the French cook. So persistently 
do these old names cling that but recently 
a cook contributing a receipt to a New 
York journal, told his readers to take 
some Crecy carrots and do thus and so. 
It is to be hoped they got some. 

To make the soup, take soup stock and 
boil carrots and corned beef in it and a 
few other soup vegetables for seasoning. 
Take out the meat and pass the carrots 
alon:^ with the stock through a seive. 
Skim well, add a small amount of flour 
or starch thickening to keep the puree 
(pulp) from settling to the bottom ; sea- 
son and serve like bean soup, with crusts 
in the plate.

1043— Salt Mackerel Boiled. 



There is as much difference between 
mackerel boiled soft and boiled hard as 
between eggs similarly cooked. If you 
would have mackerel tender, as well as 
of good color, put it on to cook in cold 
water and take it off as soon as it begins 
to boil. It is best if it can be cooked to 
order, or only as wanted, as it becomes 
hard and curls out of shape with stand- 
ing long in the water. Mackerel looks 
best if cut across, not lengthwise, each 
fish making three portions. Dish the 
skin side up and a spoonful of melted 
butter over it. 



' Mackerel put in water to freshen will 
hardly keep cweet twelve hours unless ice 
water be used or the vessel set in the 
refrigerator. It should remain in water 
at least twenty-four hours, and be changed 
once or twice. After that if any are 
wanted to broil, they should be hung up 
to dry one meal ahead. 

1044— Salt Mackerel Broiled. 



Divide the fish lengthwise, and if of 



COOKING FOR PROFIT.

the largest size, again into quarters. 
Broil over clear coals, or toast before the 
fire in the hinged wire broiler, browning 
the inside first. Serve the brown skin 
side uppermost, with a spoonful of melted 
butter poured over. It should cook in 
five minutes. 



1045— Wustard Sauce. 



Make butter sauce, and mix with ti 
made mustard enough to give it a pale 
yellow color, then let boil up again for a 
moment to thicken, but not to separate 
the butter. 



1046— Potatoes, au Naturel. 



Means that they are plain. New pota- 
toes with the skins on, should be steamed 
and served in a dish separate from the 
fish. 



1047— Chicken, a la Bechamel. 



Chickens with cream sauce. Boil the 
fowls in salted water or broth, and take 
some of the broth, strain through a nap- 
kin, boil, and thicken with flour, then 
beat in butter and add cream or rich 
milk and strain again. 



1048— Curry rf Veal, a la Calcutta. 



The specialty of the style is the putting 
grated cocoanut in the stew; and yet, 
perhaps, there will be some to say that 
It is no specialty, but common to all cur- 
ries if properly made. There is an old 
sea steward settled down in that haven of 
rest for old salts, Nipantuck Island, who 
will talk by the hour about the East 
Indies and, as he expresses it, there they 
curry everything and put cocoanut and 
cocoanut milk in everything. 
Pour a little oil or butter into a saucepan, 
throw in a minced onion, cut any pieces 
of veal you may have that will not make 
roast or cutlets into small pi.ces of one 
size, put them in with the onion, cover 
with a lid and let stew in that way with- 
out water until the meat begins to brown. 
To a pound of meat allow about a tea- 



spoonful of curry powder; shake it about 
in the stew, then put in water to barely 
cover and cook half an hour longer. 
Skim oflf the grease from one side. Add 
a heaping tablespoon of grated cocoanut, 
some S4lt and pepper, cook a few min- 
utes. Serve with plam rice at one end 
of the dish or as a border. 



1049— Macaroni, a la Creole. 



Cook Yz pound of macaroni, cut it in 
short pieces, fry a little garlic and onion 
in oil, throw in a minced red pepper, add 
a pint of tomato sauce, put in the cooked 
macaroni and shake up. 

1050— Egg Plant Breaded and Fried. 



See directions at No. 125. Besides 
that egg-plant can be breaded in egg and 
cracker dust, and fried by immersion. 
It is not absolutely necessary to parboil 
the vegetable, and in places where they 
are short of help they fry it without that 
preparation. 



1051— Frozen Buttermilk. 



A grateful change from ice cream in 
hot weather. Pat buttermilk in the 
freezer without any addition and freeze 
with rapid tiurning to make it foamy, but 
it should not be frozen solid. 

I have had to add sugar before freezing 
in some places to suit peculiar people, 
but think it spoils the buttermilk. It is 
a matter of taste, however. 



1052— Boarding the Employes. 

In all the preceding estimates and in 
all the bills of fare the provisions for the 
help have been counted the same as for 
the guests and meals charged at the same 
cost, but the same has not been done in 
regard to table service and other expenies. 
This seems the sound way to count the 
expense : when the bills are to be paid to 
the butcher and grocer it makes no sort 
of difference bv whom the goods have 
been consumed. It is but a self-decep- 
tion for any keeper or manager of a resort 
hotel to suppose that his help is costing 
less — speaking of the gross cost of i.ro- 



158 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



visions— than his paying guests by the 
meal or in the aggregate. They eat the 
same food with the difference that they 
do not have such a free choice as the 
guests. They .eat what is left over, but 
not the refuse, only that which the cooks 
prepare in excess of the demands of the 
dinmg room. Of the three classes con- 
stituting the community of a large hotel 
the officers eating at a separate table in a 
separate dining room are likely to fare 
the worst as, if the bill of fare allotted 
them be not satisfactory they have not the 
opportunities for something supplemen- 
tary which others below them enjoy. In 
a large hotel the early breakfast for the 
help consists in part of the surplus left 
from the last nights dinner with enough 
of fried fresh meat and boiled potatoes 
to make up the needed quantity; their 
dinner will consist in part of stews and 
broiled meats and fish from the dining 
room breakfast increased as before by 
broiled or roast second-rate cuts of meat 
and soup and a cheap pudding. Allow 
that such a house is well-filled with guests 
and there is little left; or that the cook is 
one of the few that can estimate closely 
how much to cook and the board of the 
help may cost somewhat less than that of 
the guests, still the chances are against it, 
while in a small house the opportunities 
are such that there is no rooni for the 
supposition of a difference unless it be in 
the helps' favor. 

In the house of which I write, I 
have made use of the help to make 
a clean sweep of every meal, other- 
wise there must have been mure to throw 
away and the estimates could not have 
been so close nor the meals at once so 
profuse and so cheap. For here as in all 
small houses^ the help, what few there 
are, take their meals immediately after 
the guests. There is no re-warming pro- 
visions from a previous meal, it would be 
unless, not one of them would even look 
at them, but if I have broiled 12 beef- 
steaks and only 8 have been taken in, 
the help will take the 4. If the guests 
have taken to corn bread this meal and 
left the rolls the help will eat rolls; if the 
guests have taken a notion all to eat 
baked potatoes then the help will take 
the fried potatoes that are left or the 
oatmeal or batter cakes and if, as is 
more likely than all there is nothing 
whatever left and we are j^lad tv^ see it sq. 



then we will fry a fev/ eggs. After dinner 
the cook takes a little survey and puts 
away the solid meats either for slicing for 
supper or re-roasting ; reserves the canned 
com and peas, the tapioca pudding if 
enough for fritters next day, the joints of 
chiclTen that will make patties or cro- 
quettes or soup, but leaves on the board 
the mutton, a la Bretonne, the baked 
beans, the stuffed shoulder of mutton, 
the haricot, the coUops of beef- with 
tomatoes, the stews in general, the maca- 
roni a la Creole, whatever of the sort 
may unfortunately have been too much, 
or if none of these, the help will make a 
good dinner of soup and fish and clean 
up the pans. With this in view all our 
dinners are planned with a cheap meat 
dish. 

The guests will eat the Spring lamb 
and chicken clean and ask at supper if 
there is any lett cold, then the help come 
in for the beef a la mode Pariseinne, and 
live high too. If they do not have first 
choice then they get even between meals 

j by drij^king iced milk while^ the guests 
^re obliged to get along with iced water. 

I Of course we are all honest; would i:oc 
take a feather's weight out of the house, 
will not even eat a meal after we are paid 
off; yet when we are handling the best 
there is in the house it is but a short dis- 
tance irom one's hand to one's mouth ; 
and does not the cook himself know 
where the tenderloin steaks are to be 
found? Look at his rotund form. 



1053— Boarding Gliildren 



Growing boys and girls consume at 
least as much food as adults, perhaps 
more. If there is any difference to be 
made in regard to children it must be for 
those of too tender age to come to table. 
Hotels generally charge full price for

mucilaginous a nature to meet with much 
favor at the North. It can be bought in 
cans like ever5rthing else. 

Take one fowl, which you can chop 
into 18 pieces, and an equal amount of 
veal cut in similar pieces and fry (saute) 
them in the usual Creole wa^ with oil or 
clear butter, with a large minced onion 
and a leak and piece of carrot and turnip 
cut m dice, and if you use green okra 
from the garden slice the pods crosswise 
and let simmer with the meat. When the 
contents of the saucepan begin to brown 
add 4 or 5 quarts of soup stock. 

If canned okra be used, fry the chicken 
and veal fiist then put in i or 2 cans and 
fill up with stock ; the okra thickens the 
soup and the amount to be used is 
optional. 

Tie up bouquet of herb, thyme, pars- 
ley, one bay leaf and 6 or 8 cloves — and 
drop it in the soup, also a pod of red 
pepper minced, and salt sufficient. Boil 
until the pieces of chicken are tender, 
take out the bunch of herbs; have a 
small saucepan of boiled rice ready at 
hand, serve a spoonful of rice in each 
plate and fill up with soup. 



1055— Red Snapper, a la Palatka 



1054 — Chicken Gumbo Soup. 

The several sorts of gumbo soup are 
all named so from being made with okra 
pods, called gumbo in the South, and 
used both green and in a dried and pow- 
dered state called gumbo file. This 
green Dowder, a few bay leaves and 
bundles of sassafras root are offered for 
sale by Indians in the New Orleans mar- 
kets and seems to constitute their entire 
stock in trade. Okra or gumbo, is of too 



First make a sauce of the head of the 
fish, then bake the sliced fish in it. It is 
a court-bouillon without wine. Split the 
head, put it to boil in 3 or 4 pints of 
water with a few green onions cut small 
and a pod of red pepper. When it has 
boiled a short time stir it about until it 
falls to pieces, making the liquor thick 
like soup. Lay the slices in a buttered 
pan strewed with finely minced shalots, 
dredge salt, scatter chopped parsley 
over; strain the fish sauce into the pan, 
bake until it is half evaporated and serve 
the remainder as sauce with each slice. 



1056— Fried Sweet Potatoes. 

They can be fried raw, or Steamed and 
then sliced raw and fried ; are good either 
way if carefully cooked in lard not too 
hct, but a little better if cooked be- 
fore frying. Cut them in slices an eighth 
of an inch thick and full size of the 
potato. Serve with fish or as a vegetable.

1057— Roast Chicken, Puree de Mar- 
rons. 



The words mean chicken stuffed with 
chestnuts— mashed chestnuts — the dish 
in reality is chicken stuffed with sweet 
potatoes. Good sweet potatoes are very 
much like chestnuts in taste. Mash and 
season well with butter and salt and 
pepper, stuff the fowls not too solid and 
roast as usual. 



1058-Beef 



and Green 
Turque. 



Peas, a la 



Take any small pieces of beef such* as 
the ends of porter-house steaks, or the 
shoulder cap, cut all to one size, put 
them in a saucepan with fat or butter 
enough to grease the bottom, and a chop- j 
ped onion, sprig of thyme and parsley ; 
let it fry a while without any water and 
stir frequently. When it begins to color, 
add water to barely cover and a pint of 
green peas to every pound of meat, 
btew together until the meat is tender ; 
season with salt and pepper. It will be 
sufficiently thickened and will be light- 
brown. Serve in flat dishes and garnish 
^with fried crusts cut in crescents, dipped 
in bright gravy and sprinkled with minced 
yolk of eggs. 

1059— Arabian Cake— Biscoscha. 



There are several grades and varieties 
of sponge cake to be found in this book, 
all good in their place, yet the one I 
used to regard the chief and is so put 
forward in the American Pastry Cook had 
nearly been set aside here because the 
boys regard it as laborious and some- 
times fail with it in warm weather, until 
on a recent occasion I found at an "Ori- 
ental Cafe" — the Turks who kept the in- 
stitution were making a specialty of 
"Arabian cake," selling considerable 
quantities to the curious passers-by and 
kept a Turkish woman cook (youn?:, and 
a real Zuleika, by the way) busy all day 
making and baking it. As I carry with 
me the "Open Sesame!" to all the 
kitchens in the land, I proceeded to in- 
vestigate and found it to be neither more 
nor less except the substitution of starch 
for flour, than our old favorite Savoy 



cake — fine sponge cake made by beating 
the eggs and sugar together without 
separating the whites and yolks, the way 
alhided to at Nos. 279 and 280 and the 
note. These Turks beat the mixture 
about an hour, but in rather a sleepy sort 
of way and with frequent relays, for Ali, 
Arabi and Raphael all had to come in 
turn and work till their oriental arms gave 
out. Some who read this will be in- 
terested in the fact that this notable cook 
from Constantinople made them always 
stir the cake one way just like American 
home folks do. This is the cake : 

I pound ,fine granulated sugar (light 
weight,) 
12 eggs. 

y^ pound of starch (or flour if for Savoy 
cake.) 
Vanilla to flavor. 

Have everything cold to begin with ; 
put the eggs and sugar together m a deep 
bowl or round-bottorned pan or candy 
kettle, and beat vigorously with a bunch 
of wire half an hour by the clock. 

It should by that time be twice or thrice 
the volume it was at the beginning. Add 
flavoring and the flour or starch. Do 
not beat after that is in but stir around 
only enough to fairly mix it out of sight. 
Bake in a deep turban-shaped mold, 
slightly oiled before the cake is put in. 

A large cake of this sort will gen- 
erally be done in half an hour. Our 
Turkish woman carried a long straw in 
her eai — ^just where a bookkeeper carries 
his pen — to try her cakes with. 

1060 -Meals to: Ten or Fifteen Cents. 



If it be true, as our figures seem to 
prove, that a pound of food and a pint 
of drink are the average requirements for a 
full meal, then if an eating-house keeper , 
offering meals for 10 cents could induce 
his customers to take a pound of bread, 
3 cents, a pound of potatoes, i cent, a 
pound of mush, i cent and 3 cups of 
milk, 3 cents, for the three meals of one 
day his outlay would be 8 cents and his 
profit 22 cents; whereas if he should give 
a pound of meat, 10 cents, a pound of 
pie, 10 cents and a pound of syrup, but- 
er and batter cakes on one plate 10 
cents, for the three meals of one day, he 
would have furnished no more than the 
average man could eat, would not have 



COOKING FOR PROMT, 



t6t 



given a full meal and yet would have 
nothing left for profit. It is by striking a 
medium between these and not neces- 
sarily by using stuff that is unfit to eat 
that some men manage in every large 
city to sell meals for lo cents and make 
a profit. "Steak, bread, butter and 
potatoes, lo cents," is what the sign 
boards announce. A pound of 8-cent 
meat, a pound of potatoes, i cent, a 
pound of bread, 3 cents— 3 pounds for 
the three meals of one day costing 12 
cents out of 30— add 3 pats of butter Yo. 
ounce each — the regular restaurant size 
— 3 c.nts more, and the eating-house 
keeper gives 15 cents and receives 30 
cents, serves 300 meals a day and has 15 
dollars a day margin out of which to pay 
his help, rent and wear and tear, etc., 
could afford even to add 3 cups of coffee 
to his sign-board inducements, while 
those who offer meals at 15 cents might 
afford to set a sumptuous table. There 
are hundreds of such places in operation : 
we are only seeking to know how they 
can do as they do. San Francisco, years 
ago, was talked about the world over as 
much on account of her having houses 
where a good meal could be obtained for 
15 cents as for being the chief city of the 
Golden State. 



1061— Country Board at Five Dollars. 



It was mentioned incidentally at the 
beginning of this book that Mrs. Tingee 
keeps boarders at $3.50 a week, having 
lately had to make a reduction from her 
former price of $4, to meet the demands 
of her boarders and the stringency of the 
times. Let us see how she does it. Our 
emals in this small country house up to 
the i2th of August, counting the small 
family meals at 5 or 6 cents each person 
and the more profuse hotel dinners at 
from 10 to 16 cents, averaged 10 cents 
each meal each person. Suppose Mrs. 
Tingee allows her meals to cost 10 cents, 
either through allowing some things to go 
to waste, or through want of skill to make 
good dishes out of cheap materials, or 
through depending too much on meat 
and butter to make up her table, then 
her boarders cost her $2.10 a week each 
and she has $1.40 each as a margin to 
meet her other expenses and pay herself; 
if she has 20 day boarders that leaves her 
$28 a week. 



She will do most of the cooking herself; 
she has 2 girls, and a boy in the yard, 
whose wages average $2 a week each, and 
their meals $2 a week more, making $12, 
leaving $16 a week for Mrs. Tingee, but 
out of that she must pay about $4 for fuel, 
light, ice and incidentals, and she has for 
herself about $50 a month. 

Now, she has house rent to pay and the 
house she occupies costs her $30 a month 
but it does not properly come within our 
scope, as her business is in taking 
day boarders and letting out rooms 
enough to pay the rent of the whole 
house. The only time that she needs 
and seeks a sympathizing ear is when a 
young couple or two gentlemen who 
have Deen paying a good price for her two 
best rooms have moved out and left her in 
fear of having little or no rent coming in. 

I So that, if she sets as good a table as we 
have been setting here and keeps her 20 
boarders she still is able to appear very 

I respectably and send her two children to 

I a good school. In reality, however, Mrs. 
Tingee does not set any such table. If 
she would she could set such meals as 

I we have shown in the divisions of this 
book before the first birthday supper at 
an average cost of about 7 cents a plate, 
and, giving a sufficiency, could keep 
her full quota of 20 boarders. There is a 
defect in her method, however, which 
never allows her full success or a full 
house, for while a pound of food and a 
pint of drink are required on an average 
to make a full meal, Mrs. Tingee devotes 
her ingenuities to make her board^srs get 
along with half a pound, and regards 
three-quarters as a piece of extravagance 
only to be indulged in on Sundays. In 
conseguence her boarders, not being well 
fed, piece out by buying apples, peanuts, 
candy, cakes and beer, and find when 
they count up at the end of the week that 
this sort of desultory boarding around has 
cost them more than it would to board at 
a good hotel, and all who are not bound 
in some way, leave her and she has but 
10 whom she can depend on to stay and 
a transient customer now and then. She 
does not allow the provisions for these to 
cost more than 5 cents a meal, 15 cents a 
day; $1.05 a week, or $10.50 a week 
total, for which at $3.50 each she re- 
ceives $35. This leaves her $24.50 in- 
stead of $28 as under the other calcula- 
tion and as tne work is less it is a greater 
proportionate profit. The great difiei- 



j62 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



ence in the two methods, is that the latter 
will not stand the test of competition. 
The landlord and his wife are boarding 
out the rent; the retail merchant and 
wife board there because Mrs. Tingee 
trades with him; the photographer has 
his gallery next door and his wife finds 
better employment retouching pictures 
for him than she would keeping house,so 
they board there, otherwise Mrs. Tingee 
would have no boarders at all, poor wo- 
man. 

It chanced some two or three years ago, 
I picked up a brief editorial article in an 
unexpected quarter, considering the argu- 
ment it contained, for it was the New 
York Hotel Reporter, that said the great 
want of the people of moderate means of 
New York and all large cities is good 
country board for the Summer months at 
about $5 a week— that is for board and 
lodgmg. Well, it would seem there are 
plenty of places offering board at that 
price ; it may be they do not meet the re- 
quirements of the city customers. In a 
railroad guide book I read of one lake n 
the State of New York, where there are 8 
or 10 hotels but 400 boarding houses ; no 
doubt but there are all grades and prices 
but still something may be wanting. 
Nearly all the well-to-do inhabitants of 
New Orleans and other southern cities 
leave their homes every Summer for a 
sojourn at some country place or at the 
seaside. At Biloxi, Pass Christian, South 
Pass, there are houses which rent for from 
$200 to $300 or $350 for the Summer sea- 
son to be kept as boarding Louses and re- 
main closed all the rest of the year. In 
the New Orleans papers I see an adver- 
tisement which reads well, it is of a Sum- 
mer boarding house at Gobegic Ferry, on 1 
the Topinabee, branch of the Tchaupi- i 
toulas river, easy to find because ex-! 
actly 90 miles from New Orleans, and 
700 feet above sea level, where there is 1 
plenty of milk, eggs, butterand fruit and i 
vegetables, where board is offered at $5 j 
a week, or $20 a month, and children 1 
under 12 are taken at hall price. 1 

According to the figures that we have ' 
devoted to Mrs. Tingee, allowing from 7 
to 10 cents a meal for provisions and 50 
cents each person as the expense of bed; 
20 boarders at $5 would pay $ 100 a week • i 
the provisions mostly home-raised may be 
set down at $1.^0 or $30 for the whole, i 
which with the $10 cost of lodging them i 



is $40 a week for 20 boarders and $60 re- 
mains. Allow $10 for drawback on chil- 
dren and monthly board and there is still 
$50 a week or nearly $200 a month for 
the family that keeps the house and does 
nearly all the work. There will be tran- 
sient meals enough sold to pay the rent, 
or boats or carriages let out, or cigars 
sold or some little side interest to keep 
the main profit of the house intact. By 
reducing the cost of meals 2 or 3 cents at 
this lo-doUar house of ours we could 
make a profit at $5 even here, where our 
meats and fish have to be expressed and 
our fruits and vegetables are nearly all 
canned goods.

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



r63 



of vegetables chopped or cut small and 
either rice, barley, macaroni or nudelsor 
the following : Take 
6 quarts stock. 

5 cups minced vegetables — being cab- 
bage, onion, turnip, carrot, celer)', 
squash, pumpkin, part or all as may suit. 

6 ounces or 2 or 3 cups vermicelli 
broken small. 

Boil and season. It will be thick 
enough if cooked until the vermicelli is 
well done. 



1063— Catfish Stewed with Tcmatoes. 



Cut fish in slices, each about 2 ounces, 
and fry (saute) them in a frying pan with 
very little butter or drippings. When 
they are partly browned and about half- 
cooked add a cup of water, a minced 
green onion or two and pod ol red pep- 
per; then strain a can of tomatoes 
through a colander to the fish and cook 
together about J--^ hour. Serve with 
strips of dry toast about a finger's length, 
in the plate. 



1064— Civet cf Rabbit, a la Cjhsseu'. 



Chasseur is hunter, a la Chasseur means 
in hunter's style ; it does not signify any- 
thing in particular in regard to the dish 
but is merely an ornamental afiix to any- 
thing that consists of game. Civet is but 
another word for a ragout or highly sea- 
soned stew. 

Trim off 8 small rabbits by chopping 
away the breasts, necks and claws, divide 
each one in 6 or 8 pieces, steep in water 
a while, saute them brown in a large pan, 
pepper and salt well and dredge with 
flour while they are browning, allowing 
about a cup of flour and shaking till the 
pieces are well coated. Then put in a 
can of mushrooms and the liquor and 
stock enough to barely cover, a bouquet 
of herbs containing onion, bayleaf and 
parsley and stew at the back of the range 
about an hour. Take out the bunch of 
herbs tit last. Garnish with small crou- 
tons dipped in minced parsley. 

1035- Chicken Giblets, a la Par- 
men'iier. 



Cut the giblets in small pieces all of 
one size and stew until tender ; strain off 
the liquor that remains and make a brown 
sauce of it, or, add to it some Spanish 
sauce and boil down until it is thick 
enough, put the giblets in the sauce ; dish 
a spoonful of mashed potatoes, make 
hollow with the back of a spoon dipped 
in water and place the stew in the miadle. 



Giblets with puree of potatoes. 



1066— Blanc Mange, 

I quart milk. 

I package gelatine — i jounces. 

I cup cream. 

y^ cup sugar. 

Flavoring. 

Put the sugar and gelatine into the 
milk and set over a slow fire or at the side 
and stir frequently until the gelatine is 
dissolved. When it shows signs of begin- 
ning to boil, take off" and strain into a pan 
and set away on ice or otherwise make it 
cold. While it is cooling stir up and 
flavor it and add the cup of cream cold. 
It will set like jelly when quite cold ; may 
be set in cups or molds and turned out, 
or cut in squares and served with s.veet- 
ened cream. Not essential to have cream 
but needs rich milk. May be flavored 
with orange or lemon peel bofled m ii or 
with extracts. 

1067— I'— A Bundle cf Suppositions. 

If the colonel and his young wife desire 
to indulge in meals a little more expensive 
than their neighbors', as has been the de- 
sire of wealthy epicures in all times, they 
can do so by only eating oatmeal and 
cream, for if they only take a large cup- 
ful each of oatmeal much requiring i 
cent's worth each of oatmeal to make, 
and take 2 cups each of delicious cold 
cream to eat it with, the cream at city 
price will cost 30 cents for the two and it 
will be 16 cents a plate or the average of 
our highest-priced dinners, for a very in- 
complete meal, and as their one maid 
servant will inevitably cost them the 
same rate, they will be at an expense of 
24 cents a meal each for provisions alone, 
and not much provisions either; but if 
they will take their i cent's worth of oat- 
meal with 2 cents' worth of milk that will 
be a different affair and much better for 
their health and temper.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



To be extravagant with buckwheat 
cakes let them have all the cakes they can 
eat, which if raised with yeast will only 
cost them 2 cents each, and put between 
them Yz cup of fine creamy butter at the 
city price of 40 cents a pound or 5 cents 
the Vz cup, and Yz cup more of pure Ver- 
mont maple syrup at $1.40 a gallon, or 
5 cents the V^ cup, and their plate of 
cakes will cost 12 cents each for material 
alone, which is higher than the averac^e 
of any breakfast or supper that we have 
set out in this book; but if they will take 
elegant silver drips which can be bought 
now at 60 cents a gallon or 4 cents a cup 
and restrict themselves to restaurant al- 
lowance of Yo, ounce of butter or even 
forego it altogether, their cake breakfast 
need not cost more than 4 or 5 cents each 
person. 

It is verv likely that the colonel's young ', 
wife would be able to prevail on the | 
butchei to cut out tenderloin steaks for 
her, such as they used to get by favor 
at our Summer house, but it would be 
much against his will as it spoils the loin 
and he would be obliged to charge her at 
least 40 cents a pound. 1 aking a quarter 
pound each and a can of best button 
mushrooms at 40 cents and ^ cup butter 
for the sauce, and rolls, butter and coffee, 
they will have managed to spend 40 cents 
each for the miterial for a breakfast and, 
allowing in a selection of this sort that lo 
cents more will feed the girl it is 50 cents 
each for the meal and $1.50 for the three 
meals of one day, a sum that with careful 
management and good cooking might 
provision them for a whole week at a 
Summer house after the method which 
these preceding pages have shown ; for if, 
instead of the 40-cent steak and 40-cent 
mushrooms or peas, she will take a pound 
of steak at 10 cents and 10 cents worth of 
peas — either green garden peas or home 
canned, and with but half the steak make 
a stew with peas, a la Turque, the meal 
need not cost more than 15 cents each, 
all counted, or 45 cents a day. 

There has been plenty of matter con- 
tributed to the newspapers at various 
times in regard to the cost of living, but 
all partaking more of the nature of argu- 
ments m favor of some person's pet scheme 
than of plam statements of actual trials. 
What we think this diary of ours proves 
is that people can live more cheaply and 
better in numbers together than they can 



by twos and threes; that a moderate va- 
riety of dishes does not necessarily cost 
more per plate than two or three dis >esin 
larger quantity would if we have the fore- 
sight to know how little of some of the 
dishes will be required and know what 
to do with the remainders, and that the 
profit or loss ofkeepmg boarders depends 
greatly upon the selection of material and 
the skill to offset one or two expensive 
dishes with a good many others made of 
cheap materials, but exceedingly well- 
cooked and well served — as for illustra- 
tion ; a pound of the breast of chicken 
costs 25 cents,andyou cannot board them 
on breast of chicken ; a pound of baked 
beans costs 3 cents, and they will not take 
beans alone ; put the two together and 
you have 2 pounds of the most desirable 
and most desired food for 14 cents a 
pound, which you can afford, and it 
takes more skill and care to cook the 
beans so that the dish will be sought after 
than it does to cook the chicken.

plate. 



1068— Tapioca Cream Soup. 

Take 3 quarts soup stock and 3 quarts 
milk, make a white roux to thicken it by 
simmering a slice of ham in 4 ounces 
butter and stirring in a cup of flour and 
add soup to the roux until it is thick 
sauce; let boil, then strain back into the 
soup. Put in a small blade of mace, a 
cupful of minced onion, a cup of turnip 
and carrot in the smallest dice and small 
cup of crushed tapioca Boil slowly un- 
til the tapioca grams are transparent and 
stir in a spoonful of chopped parsley, 
with salt and white pepper. 



1069— Fillets cf Fish, a la Norman- 
die. 



Cut the fish in thin fillets size of two 
fingers, double them and place in close 
order in a baking dish. Prepare mashed 
potatoes wich yolk of eg^ mixed in as for 
croquettes and place a border of it round 
the ed^eof the dish. 

Take the bones of the fish and stew 
them in water with onion, parsley, thyme, 
pepper and salt, making a fish stew or 
sauce, strain it off and use it to make an 
oyster stew, into which throw a few 
shrimps, crayfish, lobster pieces, scallops, 
mussels and button mushrooms, all or 
part as may be available. Pour this 
matelotte or fish stew over the fillets, 
add a cup of white wine, dredge fine 
bread crumbs and put the dish in the 
oven to bake. 

Serve one fillet, the sauce that belongs 
and some of the potato border in the same 
plate. The name has reference to the 
sea- coast customs of Normandy. 



1070— R.as^ Ham, Champagne Sauce. 



Boil a piece of ham, the thick end, and 
when nearly done put it in the oven to 
finish and acquire a brown outside. 
Slice thin, serve sauce under in the dish. 



1071 — Chamoagne Sauce. 
It is little more than a name for a 



brown sauce flavored. Take good gravy 
from the veal or beef pans (No. 576). 
Put on a spoonful of spices — allspice, 
cloves and mace — to boil in ^ cup of 
wine and strain it presently into the 
gravy. Another way that seems to meet 
the requirement of a good sauce for roast 
ham, is to add wine and a little sugar to 
the brown sauce without the spices. The 
substitute where there is no wine furnished 
is vinegar, sugar and water in brown 
sauce — it is good — nothing wrong about 
it but the name. 



1072— Sirloin of Beef, a la Hongroise. 



That is nothing but a name for you to 
attach to anv piece of warmed-over beel 
on a day wnen the dinner is such that 
you know nobody will order beef. Some- 
times you can call it a la Demidoff, or 
Malakoff, or Marco Bozarris or anything ; 
the people will go on ordering pig and 
paraire chicken with unswerving con- 
stancy, just the same. 



1073— Roast Prairia Chickens. 



Singe them, wipe clean inside and out, 
skewer through the thighs and body, or 
else tie the legs in place, put in a 
salted pan with drippings ; roast late and 
have them come out only just done 
through. Each one makes 5 dishes by 
slicing a little off the breast which is the 
meatiest part, and making 4 quarters be- 
sides. Serve with jelly or cranberry 
sauce or game sauce which is cheaper. 



1074 -uame Sauce. 



Take two-thirds brown sauce and one- 
third currant jelly or grape jelly, throw 
in 6 or 8 cloves and simmer together a 
few minutes. 



1075— Kohl-rabi, or Cabbage Turnip. 

It is the light green above-ground tur- 
nip or swelled cabbage stalk seen in the 
markets but not in common use. Pare, 
cut in large dice, boil as you would tur- 
nips and season in the same manner by 
pouring a *f hite sauce over after straining 



i66 



SAN FRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



the water away. It is like cooked cab- 
bage stalk in taste and may be cooked 
with bacon the same way. 



1076— String Be^ns, a la Turqu?. 

String beans salad, m effect. Cut the 
beans down the whole length, shredding 
them, boil till done, drain off, cool, then 
pour over enough salad oil to make them 
shine; salt, pepper, vinegar, and shake 
up well. Serve cold with the vegetables. 



1077— Umon Suufflee Pudding. 

It is the pastry cream, same as used to 
fill Boston cream puffs. No. 289, with 
white of eggs whipped to froth stirred in 
and then baked. It rises high in the 
oven; should be served immediately or 
at least not allowed to become cold. 
Use a quart of milk, 8 ounces sugar, 5 
ounces flour (a heaped cup) an ounce 
butter, 8 eggs. The yolks cooked in the 
mixture which must then b^ made nearly 
cold and flavored with lemon, and the 8 
whites, then added. A spoonful of sweet- 
ened cream in each dish for sauce. 



1078— rt'ountai.. Strawberry Ice Cream. 

Late in the Summer when strawberries 
in most places are gone and forgotten the 
mountain gardens send down their crop, 
as great a rarity in the low country as are 
peas in January. A few of them may be 
made to go a long way by making a straw- 
berry flavored ice cream and mixing one 
quart with it at the finish. 



1079— Almond Cream Cake. 



Mince a cup of almonds, boil them in 
a cup of syrup with an ounce of butter, 
put in a cup of white of eggs (8 whites) 
and stir until cooked after the same 
method as lemon honey. Spread be- 
tween layer cakes. 



1080— Keeping CLan Sids-Tcwels. 

When a correspondent writes of what 
she saw at the South Kensington Cook- 



ing School, she seems to be the most 
taken by the ceremoniousness with which 
the grand high priestess washes her 
fingers and dries them on a snowy side- 
towel every few moments. That is ^ 
good kitchen form though, as long as 
there is not much serious work to do. 
You may hear the boys anywhere, in the 
Rocky Mountains or at the Gulf of Mex- 
ico or the eastern sea-shore mention 
the Cincinnati House at Gibson City as, 
a pattern, because every morning every 
cook whatever his grade, is not only fur- 
nished a clean towel, but finds it hung on 
the hook under the edge of the table at 
his place when he comes to work. At 
this small Summer house the towel ques- 
tion seemed to be a knotty one for a 
while until that good and smart and 
pretty girl, who was my second, unravelled 
It. After making the one laundry woman 
gasp with discouragement at the sight of 
the jackets, caps and aprons I put upon 
her according to custom, I was positively 
afraid to say towels to her; it was the last 
straw and might have broke her back or 
raised a rebellion. And yet what was to 
be done? 

There is nothing degardes the kitchen 
so much as the shameful black rag that 
lies on the table in contact very likely, 
with the best and whitest dishes, and 
when hot baking-pans are to be handled 
and black-bottomed pots to be carried 
and table corners to be wiped off as well 
as one*s hands a hundred times,thc whitest 
towel becomes vile in two or three 
hours. I suppose that last year Mary 
Jane used to wash her towels out in the 
afternoon instead of taking her needed 
half hour's nap, poor thing. Well, I had 
three new towels with my knives wrapped 
in, in my valise and out they came and 
all was well for a day or two while they 
were new and nice. But my second was 
one of those extremely clean girls; she 
used to wash and wipe every egg before 
they should be used if the lots came in 
the least 9ff color ; she washed the baking 
potatoes in three waters with a scrubbing 
brush, washed green peas before she 
shelled them, picked over coffee grains 
and beans one by one and never knew 
trouble or stopoe'd singing until the work 
increased so that she could not do those 
things. It was about the evening of the 
fifth day that she was first struck by the 
enormity of the dirtiness of those towels.

Total, $7 83; 46 persons; 17 cents a 
plate. 



This morning took place the first break 
of Summer boarders for their homes; 
nine went away before dinner ; going to 
prepare their children for school for Sep- 
tember. 



1081— Bisque of Lobster. 



Bisque is paste ; bisque soups are soups 
thickened with a paste or puree or pulp 
offish or game, as bisque ice creams are 
creams thickened with pulp of fruit or 
nuts. Selected small pieces of the meat 
are put in at least as a sign of what the 
soup is made. 

Take 6 quarts of soup stock, and boil 
in it the bones or part of a fish, or per- 
haps the remains of yesterday's matelotte. 
Take out half of it and made into butter 
sauce. Pound a can of lobster to a paste, 
and mix the butter sauce with it and pass 
through a seive; strain the rest of the 
soup stock and mix both portions to- 
gether. A cupful or two of selected red 



meat of lobster may be added, and sprink- 
ling of parsley, salt and cayenne. 



1082— Baked Carp, Tomato Sauce. 



Put the fish in a baking pan without 
splitting open, with salt and butter or 
drippings, and bake half an hour. Pour 
a quart of strained tomatoes into the pan, 
add an onion and pepper, and bake half 
an hour longer. Serve by spoonfuls with 
sauce. 



1083— Brussells Sprouts. 



They are a small species of cabbage 
about the size of apples, that grow in rows 
on a tall stem. All dishes in European 
cookery that are a la Flamande are with 
Brussells sprouts. They are met with in 
only a few localities in this country. Cook 
and season the same as cabbage or orther 
greens. 



1034— "ucking Pig, a la Francaise. 



To make the stuffing; fry a minced 
onion in some fat, throw in a spoonful of 
sage, then a quantity of finely minced 
bread crumbs and ladleful of broth to 
moisten. Stir around in the frying pan 
until well mingled, season with salt and 
pepper, stuff the pig with it and roast it 
in the oven. When barely done, take 
the pig and cut it in pieces of the right 
size to serve, put them in a broad sauce- 
pan and pour in Spanish sauce to nearly 
cover, put a lid on and let stew slowly. 

Make up the stuffing from the cooked 
pig into small balls, bread and fry them ; 
serve one such forcemeat ball in each 
dish with the meat and sauce. 



1085— Salmi of Grouse with Olives. 



Roast the birds rare done, cool off, cut 
in pieces ready to serve. Make some 
Spanish sauce hot, add wine and cayenne, 
put in the cut birds and a cup of olives 
stoned and sliced. Serve with crouton 
ornaments.

SAN JiRANCISCO HOTEL GAZETTE'S 



1036— Egg-Plant Stew, a la Turqiie, 



Take rough small pieces of beef or the 
rib ends and cut to one size, put them to 
stew in water. Choose small egg-plants, 
the seeds not very distinct, pare and cut 
up in pieces like apple quarters, and put 
them with the meat. Add a large onion 
and two or three tomatoes, salt and pep- 
per. Let stew with a lid on until the 
meat is tender and the liquor is nearly all 
boiled out, and the remainder is thick- 
ened with the vegetables. It is a sort of 
gumbo, worth trying a few times. 



1087— Compote of Bananas, a la 
Richelieu. 



Make a syrup pudding sauce; cut ba- 
nanas in halves, put them in the sauce 
and let be parboiled in it, but not cooked 
too soft. Make a bed of sweetened rice 
in the dish, place bananas on the top and 
sauce. 



1088— Fried Cabbage. 

Chop, season and saute in a frying pan. 
A good way to dispose of cabbage left 
over. 



1089-Baked Barley Pudding. 

Have the barley thoroughly well boiled 
then use it to make puddings by the 
same receipts as cracked wheat. 

1090— Best Sponge or Savoy Cake. 

Make the cake mixture No. 4; and 
bake in molds instead of small shapes. 
May be flavored with lemon rind for 
lemon Savoy cake. 



1091~How Many Fires?-- Again. 



^ The one large stove has proved suffi- 
cient in all but one particular — we could 
not fill toast orders with it. If there had 
been another fire however small there 
would have been nothing more to be de- 



sired. Fortunately as there were no 
breakfast or supper bills of fare to remind 
them of "dry, dipped, buttered and milk 
toast" the boarders seldom remembered 
to want them, and then if the stove was 
crowded full with cake griddle, soup pots 
and broiling meats we had to take the 
toast to the laundry stove. 

They have a portable sort of charcoal 
stove in the South that would be a boon 
to all the resort houses elsewhere — a stone 
pail with a second bottom perforated for 
draft, put a coal of fire in and fill up the 
pail with charcoal, and you have the best 
of fires for broiling, toasting or keeping a 
boiler on, and one easily started and 
easily dropped when not wanted. Nine- 
tenths ot all the French market cooking 
at New Orleans is done on these charcoal 
burners. That includes the complete work 
of many restaurants. 

Whosever buys a stove such as our 
number 16, 8 holes, should be advised lo 
take that kind, the old pattern, and not 
to be induced to get themselves into 
trouble with a pretty range with doors and 
closets, shelves and hangers, but no room 
hardly to cook for a family. If you have 
a stove that is all top and oven with a 
good front ash pan to broil over,you may 
hang a boiling pot upon the very edge and 
it will keep on stewing just as gently as 
you want it, and you need not clear off 
everything and stop everything from cook- 
ing in order to get the cake griddle over 
the only hot place as is the case with a 
so-called range. 

If good and complete bill-of-fare din- 
ners for 50, rolls and bread baking and 
all can be done on one good stove is it 
not like taking a steam hammer to drive 
a nail to furnish a house like the Sum- 
merland House at Unitah City, that 
rarely has more than 75 boarders with : 

A 3 oven and 3 fire range. 

Two charcoal broilers for steaks and 
I fish. 

Two steam jackets for boiling meat and 
vegetables. 

A brick oven. 

A hard coal batter cake range. 

A hard coal toast range. 

A steam closet for steaming puddings. 

A steam stock boiler. 

A steam boiler for cooking eggs. 

A steam carving table. 

Steam coffee and tea urns.

{Continued from page r66.) 



and I went behind a door to watch 
what she would do. Of course she 
would not touch them, only walked 
around the table and viewed them on 
both sides ; nothing further took place 
that evening. I know the female 
mind is quick to act, but there was a 
problem that seemed too much for 
her, and took all night to consider. 
But it was all right next morning, 
for she took a stick and raked them 
into a gallon apple can, put in a small 
lump of concentrated lye, filled up 
with soap suds and let them stew for 



hours, though I had not a thing but 
old newspapers to use in the mean- 
time, and every day of the eight 
weeks since, immediately after dinner 
that dear girl has put those towels 
through the same course of treat- 
ment, left them stewing all the after- 
noon and I suppose has washed them 
out besides, but does it so quickly I 
have never witnessed the operation; 
and now if it were not for the burned 
places the same three towels hanging 
there are white enough and good 
enough to begin another campaign.

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



1095 — Banana Ice Cream. 

About three good, mellow bana- 
nas are enough for each quart of 
cream. Rub the bananas through a 
sieve; sweeten the cream as usual, 
mix in the pulp and freeze. This is 
a favorite kind when made with real 
cream, but is not very good in a 
custard mixture. 



1096— Banana Fritters. 

Make thin batter, the same as for 
apple or pineapple fritters. Cut the 
bananas in halves across, if large, or 
use whole if small; put them in a 
bowl and moisten with rum and 
sugar, dip each piece in the batter, 
and fry by dropping them in hot oil 
or lard. At many hotels they are 
only rolled in powdered sugar when 
served, but you will find they are 
liked better with sauce. 



1 097 — Oyster Soup aux Fines Herbes 

OR NEW ORLEANS STYLE. 

For a hundred people — two gal- 
lons of oysters and their liquor, two 
gallons of milk, two cans mushrooms, 
one onion, two bay leaves, a handful 
of parsley, a pod of red pepper, some 
white roux or butter and flour rubbed 
together, or common flour thicken- 
ing. 

Set the milk over the fire in one 
saucepan, the oysters in another; just 
before the oysters begin to boil drain 
them from the liquor by pouring in 
a colander, and keep them back till 
time to serve. Set the oyster liquor 
over the fire again, boil it, skim, and 
strain through a fine strainer into the 
milk, chop the onion, mushrooms 
and parsley and throw them in and 
bay leaves and pepper pod whole. 



Boil a short time ; thicken like cream, 
add the oysters at last. 



1 098 — Oyster Brochettes, a la Creole. 

Run a dozen or more of large 
oysters on a tinned skewer, drop into 
hot oil and let fry about three or 
four minutes to shrink them. Take 
out and finish them on the gridiron 
over hot coals. Dust with salt and 
pepper; serve on toast, withdrawing 
the skewer, garnish with lemon and 
parsley. 



1099 — A Proposal to Rent the Place. 

Sept. 7. — As long as the moon 
shone at night my tent among the 
bushes on a little point jutting out 
into the lake was not perceived ; there 
is no path that leads to it from the 
land side and the boat which I ha\e 
hired from John is hid under a droop- 
ing tree, and having no interruptions 
the work of transcribing the hurriedly 
pencilled figures of the summer 
accounts has been rapid and easy. 
But now the nights are dark and the 
tent with a light inside is like a huge 
lantern and attracts notice. It would 
be best moved further back if I was 
not going to leave for good. Mr. 
Farewell kindly offered me a room 
in the hill cottage to remain as long 
as his family remained, and John, 
too, who has made more pork after 
all than he expected (for he has two 
fat hogs that will weigh 250 pounds 
each) invited me to stay and have a 
month's hunting with him after the 
season is over. But I knew that 
safety from interruption lay only in 
getting clear away from the house 
where they could not call oh me to 
help them through sudden troubles. 

To-night I have heard the splash- 
ing oars of several boats passing the 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



171 



point and there were parties singing 
on the water the same as during the 
moonlight nights of last week, and 
at last commencing on the other shore 
and coming nearer I heard the fa- 
miliar sound of 

♦'Ja, wir sammeln uns am Strome," 

And seeing that the promised visit 
was to take place I threw some oil 
on a pile of dry leaves and made a 
fire at the water's edge to guide 
them. It was John bringing a letter 
from Mr. Farewell, but he had a 
pic-nic party with him of young 
people who filled two boats, and 
among them was my second and her 
sweetheart. She wore pink ribbons 
tliis time, so the blue that she used 
to wear may have been for the boat 
boy. She found an opportunity to 
tell me that with the money she has 
earned this summer she has bought 
a certain handsome young Durham 
cow that we used to admire some- 
times and carry salt and corn cakes 
to at the fence of the Barnacles' 
pasture. I don't see what she wants 
with a cow, unless maybe she is 
going to set up in business keeping 
summer boarders. Mr. Farewell's 
letter says: "Mrs. F. and I have 
been thinking of making you a pro- 
position to lease our place and run it 
yourself next year. What do you 
think of the idea? We think it would 
be to your interest because you under- 
stand the business. There are places 
in the neighborhood very successful 
that have not as good advantages as 
ours, but it needs more attention than 
I can give it. 

We should ask you no rent at first 
but to accommodate my family with 
the same rooms we now occupy dur- 
ing the summer season. Come over 
and let us talk about it. 

We have had quite a busy time 
until yesterday. 



The relations who were expected 
early in the summer arrived the day 
after you went away. We regretted 
very much that they had not come 
sooner. Unfortunately, too, Mary 
Jane had a spell of sickness in the 
midst of it. I should have come over 
to see you if I had known your where- 
abouts. Do not fail to come and see 
us before you leave." 



He would ask no rent but his fa- 
mily's summer board. Let us see 
how much rent that would be. There 
are six of them in the family. This 
summer they have been waited on by 
the regular "help" of the house, but 
if this arrangement were made they 
would have a servant of their own, 
that would be seven. And under 
such an arrangement they would 
stay here twelve weeks. Our figures 
show that it costs $5.40 per week to 
keep each person according to the 
style of 'the few weeks past. All 
things considered there would be no 
need to charge for the servant, who 
would relieve the house girls of so 
much work, therefore the expense 
would be: 

6 persons @$5.40 each $32.40 per 
week; for 12 weeks, total $388.80. 

That is what I shall have to pay 
them in the way of rent. 

If they go to some other resort 
they cannot get as good as they have 
here for less than ten dollars per 
week each and their one servants 
board free ; that will be for 6 persons 
12 weeks, total $720, a difference in 
their favor of $331.20. I had rather 
pay them a cash rent of $500, on con- 
dition that they come and board with 
me at $ 10 per week each for 1 2 weeks ; 
which would cause them to pay me 
back $220. 



Another consideration is that they 
would occupy three of my best rooms, 



172 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



which for at least six weeks of the 
season I could fill with transients 
who would pay $14 per week each 
or even more for choice rooms; and 
if not transient couples there will be 
parties like the military cadets who 
can be put four in a room at special 
rates which will still make the rooms 
pay better than having cost-price 
boarders in them. A man cannot be 
too careful of his best rooms. I have 
seen a small hotel-keeper lose money 
every day in a most prosperous season 
through his want of skill in rooming 
people: he had thirty rooms and got 
thirty single persons in them one in 
each room, and he could not get 
them out nor any more in, and the 
tide of tourists was surging up against 
his doors. Some people will pay 
double to keep a good room to their 
individual use, but that was not the 
case with his agreements. At the 
Hotel Fantastic a rich man and his 
wife occupied three of the b^st rooms 
but they paid three hundred dollars 
per month for them and their board. 
At the KennesawHouse a banker and 
wife paid $150 per month for two 
rooms and their board. At the 
Bubbling Springs we had 50 boarders 
who paid $15 per week each. If I 
take up Mr. Farewell's offer I shall 
be letting them have three best 
rooms and board for six for $ 1 30 per 
month of 28 days or $21.60 per 
month each person. Just about half 
what it is worth, and my rent on such 
terms would be too high. 



On the other hand it is to be con- 
sidered, next season will be far better 
than this has been because the place 
is now well advertised. Mr. Fare- 
well has put perhaps $200, or $250 
in advertising, of which I should reap 
the most benefit next season, for he 
began so late, the effects have only 



been felt during the closing weeks, 
when many came out of curiosity to 
see a place they had read about; most 
people make up their minds where 
they will spend the summer or winter 
a good while before the time comes. 
They may go to a place and it does 
realize their expectations. While 
they are dissatisfied they recall the 
good words they have heard or read 
in favor of some other place and re- 
solve to go to the other place next 
time. How often have I heard them, 
when they were chagrined and hu- 
miliated over watered milk, bad 
butter and coarse meat, say haughtily : 
"Ah, never mind, we'll go to Sara- 
toga next year!" — as if that was 
going to be any improvement, the 
poor innocents! But we have set an 
excellent table here, and all have 
gone away praising not only the 
cooking but the provisions; they will 
say when they hear their friends 
complain of places: "Ah, you ought 
to have gone with us to Uintah 
Lake!" And they will all come next 
year. 



But, again, there is the considera- 
tion that I should not be able to do 
my own cooking and taking care of 
provisions. Perhaps I should get 
cooks who would let the help run 
away with the kitchen and feast on 
the best while the guests were 
served with the worst; perhaps they 
would carelessly allow every meal 
served to cost three cents more than 
it ought to cost; that leakage with the 
increased number of people would 
amount to $25 per week and in twelve 
weeks would be a loss to me of $300. 
The most serious loss is in the mis- 
management of meat. The most 
successful hotel keeper at Bubbling 
Springs is one who still cuts and 
broils and carves the meats himself; 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, ,

though he has paid for his hotel out 
of its earnings and has built on to it 
till its size is double what it was when 
he bought it and has advanced his 
rates, too. He has cooks, but he cuts 
and broils, all or part of the meats 
and so keeps the chief expense under 
curb and bridle. He has a wife who 
can fill his place at the desk when 
necessary. 



There is,however, a great deficiency, 
of amusement at this house of ours. 
If there were more pastimes there 
would be so many more transient 
visitors that a few hundred dollars 
rent more or less would not be worth 
considering. I will see^ what Mr. 
Farewell as landlord is willing to do 
in improving the place as a pleasure 
resort before deciding. 



CONCLUSION. 

A few materials have been men- 
tioned as derived from the cook's 
valise, they are not included in the 
bills. These are extract of meat, 
catsups and two or three dollars'worth 
of canned truffles. Opinions will 
differ on such matters, but as every 
cook carries his own knives and lard- 
ing needles I think it wise and politic 
under such circumstances as are 
detailed in the preceding pages for 
the cook to carry a small stock of 
such extra helps besides. If the 
proprietors of the small houses knew 
everything they would see the ad- 
visability of providing all sorts of 
seasoninj^s at their own expense, as 
they do not understand the use of them, 
the cook does well to supply him- 
self and get his pay back in the repu- 
tation which he gains for the superior 
flavor of his dishes and for the un- 
expected production of a truffled fowl 



when it may chance there are visitors 
present who will appreciate the effort. 
For a good reputation means good 
pay and choice of good positions, and 
is wortn a little outlay of money as 
well as a good deal of hard work to 
secure. 



TO MAKE GLAZE. 

Extract of meat and the meat 
glaze made by the cooks are vary 
nearly the same thing. It is an ex- 
pensive substance when made of the 
best quality, retailing at about thirty 
cents an ounce. The cheapest is the 
Australian extract of beef solid and 
dry in bladders, which sells at $1.25 
per pound. Meat extract added to 
consommes and gravies gives them 
a rich flavor which is one of the 
evidences to the guests at t^ble that 
there is a professional cook in the 
kitchen. 

There are times when a cook can 
make his own glaze, which is nearly 
the same as extract, the difference 
being that it contains more gelatine 
from the bones than the extract of 
lean meat. When there happens to 
be a great plenty of soup bones and 
the stock boiler is full of rich stock 
or bouillon^ and when instead of 
using it oyster soup must be made, 
then the stock should be strained off 
into a large copper saucepan and be 
boiled down rapidly until it is nearly 
dried down to gravy. Then skim 
off the fat, add some salt, and simmer 
down carefully until it looks thick 
and dark and is in danger of burning. 
Four it into a jar or can; it will set 
solid when cold and a slice taken out 
and added to the soup on a day when 
the stock is poor will be found the 
one thing that was needed to bring 
it up to the first quality. Such glaze 
or extract will keep for months. The 
French name is glace iVron. ^larce. )

Tl&e Ballade of 

A printer threw away his stick 
And washed his inky hands. 

"I'll go and tempt the Fates," he cried, 
"Far off in Western lands." 



And so he landed in Begosh, 
A brand new Kansas town, 

And there he built a small hotel 
And named it "Settle Down." 



He was the landlord, clerk and cook 

The table waiter, too. 
He made the beds and tended bar — 

And had enough to do. 



The town grew fast, the hotel throve, 
He hired some extra hands. 

His profits quite as fast as got 
He put in Begosh lands. 



And as he throve he felt a want : 
Mysterious, dim, obscure. 

He could not tell exactly what, 
But there it was, for shure. 



"Hal Ha!" he cried, as sudden light 
Broke on him while at dinner, 

"I want a printed bill-of-fare — 
"I do — as I'm a sinner." 



There was no printing press in town; 

He sent and bought him one. 
It came, with type, he worked — and lol 

The bill-of-fare was done. 



ISettle Mown." 

He loaded it with lots of French 

To sort of give it style. 
And proudfuUy he set it forth 

His boarders to beguile. 

There came six cowboys to his board, 
All armed and fierce and grim. 

Each man picked up a bill-of-fare — 
Then hastened out to him. 

Then on that pale and trembling man 
Their words fell fierce and hot: 

"Why don't yer talk United States? 
"What is this Dago rot.? 

"Wlia's 'A lay-matree D-hoteV f

"Yer'r growin' rich! Yer'r gettin' proud 1 

"Yer want ter be er dude. 
"Ther daisies claim yer tender toes. 

"Yer'U du ther grass roots good." 

There fell a grave like silence then — 
Each man his cannon drew.

HOTKL CARVING 



Cef -.ain men who practise the same 
set of duties every day will acquire 
extraordinary dexterity in their line, 
and they are the men to watch if 
one would learn all the sharp cuts in 
carving. George McG — , a South- 
ern hotel keeper v/as one of these 
fine carvers, but rather off-hand and 
wasteful with it, for he was full of 
other business and would not dwell 
upon trifles; he was for rapidity and 
did not stop to clean all the meat 



"Well — that turkey weighed 12 
pounds before it was cooked — I 
suppose I could carve 35 or 40 
orders from it if I was trying, and I 
don't think there are many carvers 
around here can beat me." 

" Mr. McG — I think I can just 
about double that number for a five 
dollar bet." 

"I'll bet you a ten dollar gold 
piece against seven days wages you 
can't beat it over ten dishes" — retum- 




Phlladelphia Capon. 



from the carcasses; left them to be 
stripped aftersvards for salad or hash. 
There was another man employed 
in his house, a professional carver, 
Jake Carter by name, and one day 
he said: 

"Mr. McG — , how many orders 
do you think I can get off this 
turkey.?" 

"Oh — I don't know — how much 
does it weigh?" 

"Here it is — you can judge for 
yourself." 



ed McG — and not thinking any more 
about the matter he turned on his 
heel and went off to the front of the 
house. But Jake Carter called wit- 
nesses to watch and off that one 
turkey he carved and sent in 70 
passable orders. It was nearly two 
years before McG — would pay the 
bet, and then he was greatly in need 
of Carter's services at a banquet and 
was obliged to pay it; but that was 
only one specimen of Carter's skill 
as a carver which has been so valu- 



(ITO)

able to him that he has had fourteen 
years constant employment in one 
city, the time being devided between 
only two hotels. 

The art and the difficulty of it 
consists in slicing broad but thin, 
even as thin as paper. 

Of course there are two sides of 
the carving question and the con- 
sumer may not see the subject in the 
same pleasing light that the calculat- 
ing hotel man does; there must be a 
medium observed that will result in 
giving satisfaction to the guests at 
table, yet it is so true that nearly all 
hotel dishes contain twice as much as 



are used for all purposes, and withal, 
the carver must know where the 
joints are so well that his sharp 
knives will pass through them with- 
out contending against the bones. 
With such a keen knife the breast 
of a small chicken can be laid open 
so as to top cover four dishes, which 
would not make any showing upon 
two dishes in the hands of a clumsy 
carver, and a large chicken will cover 
six or eight. 

The method is, to place a spoon- 
ful of the stuffing in the dish, slice 
meat off the drumstick and place be- 
side it, or a joint of the wing and on 




American Thanksg^ivingf Turkey. 



they need and the cost of provisions 
is needlessly increased in that way 
that a skillful carver who can make 
a dish look broad and plentiful with- 
out giving it much weight may be 
the most valuable man in the house. 
Some men are not adapted to be- 
come good carvers; quick, impatient, 
irritable men are not. It takes an 
easy-going imperturbable person 
who cuts smoothly with long and 
steady strokes and does not see-saw 
and scatter the splinters. The knives 
must be thin and as keen as razors; 
there can be no good carving with 
the ordinary kitchen knives which 



top lay the white meat as broad and 
thin as the size of fowl will allow. 

While such directions may read 
well enough it will be found the 
practice is not so easy unless pursued 
with steady system. Take up the 
chicken by inserting the fork in the 
cavity of the neck, where the crop 
was, and keep the fork there in one 
place until the fowl is disjointed and 
the breast is in slices. First take off 
the legs and thighs, cutting to the 
hip joint, then with a turn of the 
wrist throwing it out of the socket 
and pass the knife clear through, 
hold up the carcass and strike the

knife through the small of the back 
and the lower part or side bones fall 
off. Then remove the wings at the 
sockets. Next take off the first slice 
— the brown outside — of the breast. 
If a large fowl you can get a broad 
slice more of white meat before 
touching the bone. Next to that is 
the fowl's shoulder-blade, a bone 
almost like the wishbone, imbedded 
in the white meat and very much in 
the way of the carver who is not 
ported ; but your knowing hand takes 
hold of it by the projecting knob, 
which is the wing socket, and gently 
pulls it off and the whit^ meat that 
comes with it and coveis it, and it 
makes a slice itself almost as thin and 
quite as broad as the others. Under 
that and lying close to the breast 
bone is another layer to be taken off 



with the point of the knife and that 
makes four slices of white meat from 
one side, eight from the two sides, 
to make the tops of dishes partly 
made up of a slice from the leg, or a 
side bone or split of the upper part 
of the back. 

In carving a turkey the proceed- 
ing is the same but less difficult as 
there is more meat to work on. The 
usual way, which was the way Mc- 
G — did, is to place the carving fork 
astride of the breast bone and keep 
it there until the turkey is all cut up, 
but Carter objected that thrusting 
the fork in there cut through a slice 
of the white meat in the best part on 
each side of the boite and he took a 
hold in the crop cavity as already 
mentioned.

ARTISTIC COOKBRY 

And Notes on the London Cookery and Food Exhibition of 1885. 



BY JESSUP WHITEHEAD. 



The thousands of intelligent and 
progressive workers who are now 
using Whitehead's Hotel Books are 
reminded of a promise w^ritten some 
years ago in the American Pastry 
Cook^ at No. 221, to give at a sub- 
sequent time certain illustrated in- 
structions in cake ornamentation, and 
also some further details of the 
method of preparing stands and 
socles for meat dishes named at No. 
802 j. Under the styles of table 
service at present prevailing, there is 
not much demand for work of that 
kind, however beautiful it may be; 
still, whenever the holiday season 
approaches, with its banquets and 
decorated tables, some letters always 
come with reminders that those 
promises remain unredeemed. The 
completion of a new volume in the 
series now furnishes the desired op- 
portunity. 

Had these lines been written a few 
months earlier, it would probably 
have been with the impression that 
a revival of what is called artistic 
cookery, which is really only orna- 
mental cookery, was taking place; 
the rather unsatisfactory result of the 
recent cookery and food exhibition 
at the Royal Aquarium, London, has 
a tendency to dispel that idea, how- 
ever, and seems to show that there 
is but little recompense to be ex- 
pected for any efforts in that line, the 
times being too thorougly practical 
in their tendency to allow much 



demand for such fragile and transit- 
ory work as the cooks can put upon 
their cold dishes. A resort hotel in 
the United States may go through a 
season's business, entertain ten thou- 
sand guests, and pay « chef the high- 
est salary, and yet never require a 
single ornamental dish beyond a 
turkey in jelly to be sliced before 
served, or some other such simple 
dish. Still, as 

"BEAUTY IS ITS OWN EXCUSE FOR 
BEING," 

we must pursue the ornamental 
branch as a labor of love, because we 
take pleasure in showing such work, 
as the cooks of the largest cities 
yearly make displays of pieces that 
cost them nights and days of patient 
toil, simply keeping up the fashions 
of other times for their own pride 
and gratification. Numbers of the 
British aristocracy patronize and en- 
courage the ornamental work that 
perpetuates old customs, such as 
boar's head banquets, and the En- 
glishman who eats five meals a day 
will have the buffet or sideboard, 
where the early lunch or late cold 
supper is displayed, decorated in his 
ckef'*s best style, if he can afford it, 
for there it does not interfere with 
the newer floral fashions which rule 
the dinner table. At some American 
hotels, where a specialty is made of 
serving banquets to order, this orna- 
mental work frequently comes in

place, and on many occasions, such 
as holidays and anniversaries, the 
cook can bring in his little surprises 
for the benefit of his own reputation, 
if for nothing else. 

It was not 

THE LONDON EXHIBITION 

alone that gave seeming indicatons of 
a change to a revival of ornamental 
pieces, for its precursor, a similar ex- 
hibition at Berlin a year or two pre- 
vious, which has already been alluded 
to in this book (No. 692) where the 
Emperor and Empress gave their 
personal attention to the encourage- 
ment of such work had the appear- 
ance of originating the movement of 
which the London exhibition with 
its imposing plan and extensive ad- 
vertising was a continuation. 

The after report shows it to have 
been principally an advertising ex- 
position of materials and appliances, 
and in spite of the best endeavors of 
its promoters, the cooking depart- 
ment attracted less attention than the 
sideshows and the music. There were 
about 300 exhibitors, however, and 
several gold medals and purses were 
contested for in various departments, 
that of artistic cookery being the 
most interesting. 

In accordance with the European 
proprieties, the London exhibition 
started under the patronage of a 
dozen titled personages and a jury 
besides of twenty-six ladies and 
gentlemen in the artistic cookery 
department. The motive power of 
the whole affair seems to have been 
furnished by three or four firms ex- 
tensively engaged in the catering and 
restaurant business,with a hard work- 
ing honorary secretary who managed 
all the details, and for whom at last 
a purse was made up by subscription 
of the exhibitors in recognition of his 
untirinsT exertions. One of these 



catering firms contracted to furnish 
meals as follows: 

Hot and cold lunches at 50 cents 
per head.. 

Dinners a la carte from 60 cents 
upwards. 

The club dinner at 85 cents. 

The table d'h6te dinner at $1.25. 

The dinner a la carte is the restau- 
rant style where every dish in the 
bill of fare has the price attached, and 
a person can order according to what 
he wishes to spend. 

The club dinner is in courses, the 
person takes all that is offered,in good 
form but without much choice and 
pays a fixed price for the repast. 

The table d'hote is the hotel plan; 
the person chooses from the bill of 
fare whatever he joleases and as 
much as he pleases, and pays a fixed 
price for the repast, be it little or 
much. We give these particulars to 
show the ideas of theLondon caterers, 
of the worth of the different meals. 

On certain stated dates they an- 
nounced they would serve: 

The Indian dinner at $1.25 per 
head. 

The American dinner at $1.75. 

The old English dinner at 1.50. 

Dinner a la Francaise at $1.50. 

The Indian dinner was intended 
to give prominence to East Indian 
products and dishes of curries, pillaus, 
kabobs, rice, chutneys and teas, a fea- 
ture that was instigated by a firm 
engaged in the East India trade. 

The old English dinners we have 
no particulars about, but doubtless it 
included roast beef and plum pud- 
ding, whatever the side effects may 
have been, and the French dinner as 
surely included bards and braizes^ 
sautes and ragouts^ as well as sorbets 
and sucres. 



180

It was certainly atr ibute to the ex- 
cellence of American fare that the 
price of the 

AMERICAN DINNER 
was placed the highest in the list; the 
plan probably contemplated oysters, 
turkey, terrapin and canvas back,with 
hominy or corn, and a pumpkin pie 
not very far off, and it is to be hoped 
the caterers were well aware that ice 
cream, the pure article frozen, is reg- 
ular American diet. We eat it three 
times a day and once at night after 
the theatre. 

There was a vast variety in kinds 
of goods exhibited, ranging from 
water filters and ranges, electric light- 
ing for dining-rooms, and refrigerat- 
ors and silver plating to the flexible 
glass neckties and 
FLEXIBLE GLASS WEDDING CAKE 

decorations, and from steam machin- 
ery for making bread and cake, to 
"Mrs. Butcher, vegetable flower cut- 
ter," who announced: "Flowers 
carved by hand from carrots and tur- 
nips. The process demonstrated." 
This must have been a very useful old 
lady to have around at such a time, 
and her art has some relation to the 
wax flower work to be mentioned 
further on. Another oddity among 
the entries is "Maids of Honour, a 
peculiar kind of Cheese-Cakes which 
have been sold at the original shop, 
Hill street, Richmond, for nearly two 
centuries." (See No. 505.) 
• There were 

PRIZES OFFERED 
for small dishes of sweets, best four 
by one person, and best two prizes 
for cold entrees in sets, or for groups 
of savories and sweets, all by the 
same maker; prizes for folding nap- 
kins and for the best set table, and 
prizes by the gas stove makers for 
best things baked in their contriv- 
ances; and at certain times there were 



lectures on cookery which we are led 
to infer from the reports proved less 
attractive than the various side-shows 
which had been admitted to the 
building. 

The two or three days devoted to 
the 

ARTISTIC COOKERY CONTEST 

proved the most interesting and drew 
together the chefs and caterers from 
vorious parts of "the kingdom." 
Some of the prizes were: 

For two grosse pieces, fish, meat, 
fowl or game, a gold medal and $30; 
second prize, silver medal. 

Four dishes, cold entrees, prizes 
the same. 

Six dishes of meat, poultry, etc., 
larded and trussed, etc., ready for 
cooking. Prize, silver medal and 
$10. 

Trophy of birds, animals, fish, 
flowers, fruit, cascades, temples, or 
landscapes, any size suitable for buf- 
fet. Prize, silver medal and $10. 

Four ornamental blocks for sweets 
or savories made of either of the fol- 
lowing: Saindoux, stearine, salt, 
wood, raised paste, rice, or bread. 
Prize, bronze medal and $5. 

A decorated Christmas cake. 
Prize, bronze medal. 

Twelve varieties of rolls and bread. 
Prize, silver medal. 

Cheap soup for the poor with 
recipe for making and the cost. 

There were about 180 entries in 
the cookery lists. 

The principal pieces entered were: 

A cygnet (young swan) in galant- 
ine on wax stand. 

Boar's head on wax stand. 

Peacock a la royale. 

Round of beef a I'Ecossaise. 

Dinde (turkey) a I'Imperatrice. 

Galantine de faisan (pheasant.) 

Boar's head. 

Dish of game.

(hotel) on mutton fat stand (a bas- 
tion.) 

Hure de sanglier (wild boar's 
head) a la St. Hubert, on mutton fat 
stand (a fig tree.) 

In the section of "trophies" of 
birds, animals, etc., the pieces entered 
were castles, temples, windmills and 
the like made of sugar or gum paste, 
one temple being made of wood 
covered with icing, and one consisted 
of objects representing scenes from 
operas, in sugar work. There were 
also entries of — 

Two decorated salt blocks, suitable 
for galantines, tongues, etc. 

Two decorated salt blocks, suitable 
for boar's head, raised pies, hams, etc. 

Four carved salt blocks. 

Four ornamental blocks of wood, 
salt and wax. 

These selections from a lengthy 
catalogue will give an idea what the 
display was made of. The exhibitors 
were the chefs in the employ of cer- 
tain lords and ladies in most cases, 
and of the leading restaurants and 
London hotels. These were the plans 
before the opening. They were 
carried out with only partial success. 
The after report says the exhibitors 
succeeded in getting a good adver- 
tisement of their wares if they did 
not find many purchasers; and the 
artistic cookery competition brought 
together a few good pieces and a 
great many indifferent and bad ones. 
» This is not to be wondered at. As 
is the case with the exhibits made at 
the 

COOK'S ANNUAL BANQUETS 

in this country the ornamental work 
is done under great difficulties , usually 



in the nights after the day's work has 
been performed, and the cooks are 
almost all out of practice. If they 
had the same tasks to perform weekly 
or monthly they would learn by ex- 
perience and improve on their former 
efforts, but if only once a year and 
they try a new thing each time it is 
impossible for their works to be 
strictly works of art or even com- 
monly admirable. Still there are 
some champions in this line and for 
their best efforts a 

CHAMPION PRIZE 

was offered in addition to the other 
prizes, not to be restricted to any one 
department, but to be awarded for 
the best piece in the whole exhibition. 
It was won by a hotel confectioner 
for a trophy in sugar work ; this chef 
(Tceuvre consisted of a double vase of 
flowers moulded in sugar and colored 
to imitate the natural tints. 

This award gave dissatisfaction to 
one person at least, this was an ex- 
hibitor, a champion, too, in his line, 
chef to a lord, author af a book on 
confectionery, and who had some 
admirable pieces on exhibition and 
he has since challenged the champion 
prize winner — the hotel man — to an- 
other contest for $50 a side. The 
dissatisfied man is a Frenchman and 
requires a jury composed of three or 
four English cooks and as many 
French to decide upon the result. 

Amongst the regrets expressed 
that this exhibition had not proven 
richer in fine works of culinary art, 
it is mentioned that the French cooks 
in London had made a display of 
their own some months previous and 
shown much superior work. As some 
of the exhibitors have furnished de- 
scriptions of their dishes for publica- 
tion, it is possible to give a very fair 
idea of what "very best" work con- 
sists.

ROTHSCHILD. 

By M. Alfred Suzanne, of London, 

Choose some large fresh truffles, 
all of one size and as round as pos- 
sible. Having thorougly cleansed 
them by brushing the mould off in 
water, set them to boil slowly 
for half an hour in a champagne 
"mirepoix." When cold, drain the 
truffles, saving the liquor in which 
they have been boiled, and with a 
round cutter scoop out all the inside 
of the truffles. Next, make a "salpi- 
con" compound of chicken, mush- 
rooms, tongue and truffles; these in- 
gredients must be stamped out with 
a round cutter, the third of an inch 
in diameter, and amalgamated to- 
gether with some AUemande sauce. 
When ready to serve, warm up the 
truffles in some of the "mirepoix," 
the remainder of which is reduced 
with some Espagnole sauce to pour 
round the entree. Fill up the truffles 
with the hot salpicon, and serve. 

The season of the London Exhibi- 
tion was the season also of 

THE TRUFFLE HARVEST 
in Italy and France. Some exceed- 
ingly fine truffles were shown, some, 
it is stated weighed i ^ pounds each. 
When absolutely fresh, as these were, 
the truffle is a thing to raise enthu- 
siasm in the mind both of the gour- 
mand and his cook; it has a rich, 
nutty flavor that is peculiarly its own 
and a pefume as pervading as that 
of a bunch of ripe bananas. It is a 
tuber that grows spontaneously, just 
below the surface of the ground; 
some are nearly white all through 
but the best are jet black. One re- 
commendation of the truffle in the 
eyes of the wealthy is its dearness, 
which keeps it above the reach of 
"common people." A dish of large 
truffles prepared as directed in the 



recipe for a fasionable dinner party 
fifteen or twenty might perhaps cost 
fifty dollars. The canned and bot- 
tled truffles ranging from the size of 
a gooseberry up, and which cost 
about a dollar an ounce, do serve a 
purpose in furnishing a name for a 
dish, but their intrinsic value is noth- 
ing at all; they are not even the 
ghost of the real, fresh article. 



NECTARINE DE FOIE GRAS A LA 
MOLESWORTH. 

By M. Alphonse Landry, of London, 

A cylindrical mould resting on a layer 
of pounded rough ice is to be lined with a 
bright aspic jellj, the sides being decorated 
with cut truffles. Line the mould a second 
time with white sauce chaudfroid. When 
set, fill the mould lightly with foie gras 
mixed with truffles, both cut into small 
dice. To set the whole, fill up the mould 
with a good brown sauce chaudfroid, and 
finish with essence of truffles and aspic 
jelly of a good consistency. Let the mould 
remain in the ice until wanted, when dip it 
into hot water and turn out the contents on 
a dish. Fill the centre with truffles, and 
put croutons of aspic jelly round the base. 

Foie-gras is liver-fat or fat liver; 
the French language generally puts 
the cart before the horse that way; 
but it specially means the livers of 
fat geese that come principally from 
Strasbourg where a great business is 
made of fattening geese for the sake 
of the livers. 

Pate - de -foie - gras means two 
things, it is either paste of fat liver, 
with truffles in it, such as comes in 
jars from Strasbourg, or pie of fat 
livers — according to the accent on 
the word pate. The pie or pate made 
of a crust baked in a raised mould is 
oftenest lined inside with a coating 
of paste of foie gras and then filled 
with v2iwfoies gras and seasonings 
covered and baked; to be eaten cold. 
M. Landry's dish above discribed is 
of cooked foies gras and truffles in

ORNAMENTAL SALT BLOCKS OR 
STANDS. 



A cook having either of the fore- 
going named dishes in preparation 
and having to sei-ve them entire at a 
dinner party will naturally look 
around for some means to elevate it 
into a conspicuosness corresponding 
to the recherche character of the 
composition and brings in little bits 
of scenery in the way of perhaps a 
castle carved in salt, with all sorts of 
ornamental details below while the 
top with its towers and battlements is 
so shaped that it holds the dish of 
timbales, already built up on a double 
crouton of bread fried brown, or 
other foundation; or some slender 
design of figures holding up a stand 
on which the ornamented "nectar- 
ine" is suitably displayed, bordered 
and brought in contrast of colors. 

For salt blocks are carved in selected 



blocks of rock salt, which is semi- 
transparent and has a reddish color, 
and in the finest table salt caked to- 
gether to the compactness and almost 
the hardness of stone. A "trophy 
of fillets of soles" might find a hand- 
some resting place on top of a rock 
of rock salt carved into 

A SEA CAVERN 
below; set upon glass with boats 
and other accessories of a cavern 
scene carved out of the pure white 
fine salt for contrast. 

And when any cook or set of 
cooks have spent more time and 
pains on the ornamental stands than 
the edible dishes have cost them, it is 
but natural for them to carefully 
mention the stand or socle in every 
catalogue, and name their piece a 
bastion of truffles, or a "nectarine de 
foies gras sur socle,'''* A man does 
not want people to fail to notice the 
stand or socle that he has been work- 
inor on of nic^hts for two weeks be- 
fore, merely because they are eager 
to sample the contents of the upper 
story.

Fiir. I. 



Dominica.ines de Volaille. 



By Mr. C. J. Corblet, of London. 



Take a dozen tongue-shaped moulds as 
sold at the principal London coppersmith's. 
Butter them, line them with thin slices of 
raw filleted chicken flattened out, and then 
fill them up with a galantine farce by means 
of a forcing-bag. 

The farce is made as follows : Take the 
remains of the flesh of the four chickens 
which have already yielded the fillets for 
lining the moulds. Put the chicken meat 
through the sausage machine, with twelve 
ounces of white of veal, and as much lard- 
ing bacon; season with salt and spices: and 
pass through a sieve. Five large raw 
truffles and five ounces of tongue (red) cut 
in large short strips are to be mixed in. 
When the moulds are filled with this mix- 
ture, place them in a sautd pan, and put 
them in a mild oven for half an hour. When 
cooked, turn them out on a napkin and let 



them get cold, trimming all the same shape. 
Sauce them over with a white supreme 
chaudfroid sauce, with the exception of the 
thick end, which is to be sauced with a 
brown chaudfroid sauce. Now cut up in 
cocks'- comb shape two dozen pieces of 
very red tongue, and dip them in some 
aspic jelly half set. Dish the dominicaines 
up against a wooden stand covered over 
with mutton fat spreading the fat with aspic 
jelly, so that the edible shall not come in 
contact with the fat. Alternate each do- 
minicaine with one of the pieces of tongue, 
filling the space between the upper cup and 
the dominicaines with the cocks'- combs 
passed in aspic jelly. The upper cup should 
be filled up with a Russian salad, and at the 
foot of the stand on either side must be 
placed four artichoke bottoms filled up with 
a vegetable salad mixed with mayonnaise 
and decorated with aspic jelly.

A chaudf roid sauce is one that will 
set like jelly when cold. 

The woodcut representation above 
gives an idea of the appearance of an 
ornamental piece — a cold entree that 
was awarded the prize of a gold 
medal at the French cooks' own ex- 
hibition in London. It is but justice 
to all concerned to say that these 
pictures are far less handsome than 
the reality. It is a piece that illus- 
trates completely the explanations of 
the methods followed which are 
found in the salads and cold dishes 
addition to the AmericanPastry Cook^ 
No. 8o2J. It was an original design, 
but employed: 

1st. The wooden stand. 

2nd. The wax flower and leaf or- 
naments. 

3rd. The figures of swans made 
of mutton fat by casting in metal 
moulds. 

There are shops in London where 
a great variety of moulds are kept 
for such purposes, usually they are 
of pewter and consist of two parts 
hinged together. Some are swans, 
some battle horses, some dragons, 
mermaids, deer, lions, dolphins, in 
short anything that would be suit- 
able to place where the swans appear 
in the cut above can be bought or 
hired. The process is but to fill them 
with the whitest fat that can be ob- 
tained, in a melted state, open the 
moulds and take the figures out when 
cold. 

Another sort of mould is also 
mentioned in the recipe; tongue- 
shaped moulds, and some London 
manufacturers advertise that they 
make any sort of mould to suit new 
designs and new fashions as they are 
required. 

Another requirement is the wooden 
stand. The picture shows a wooden 
stand of two stories, like two cake 
stands set one upon another, except 



that these are two bowls or cups in- 
stead of flat stands. The whole of 
the stand is covered with mutton fat 
so that the wood is not perceivable 
but it looks like a stand of wax. The 
edible part is built up in the larger 
bowl and ornamented also with 
edibles. It was a symmetrical object 
and glistening with colored jellies 
and meats, and colored salads above 
the waxen wreath that borders the 
large bowl might well claim atten- 
tion and admiration. 

A few cooks will carry a small 
assortment of moulds along with them 
when they travel and if they remain 
for years in the same city may acquire 
a large collection ; this is not the rule, 
however, and when a party is to be 
provided for on short notice the cook 
must either pick up some such orna- 
mental objects as plaster images or 
toy birds and animals and make his 
own moulds in plaster of paris, or 
else make designs that do not require 
moulded figures, as can well be done 
according to the following showing. 

The following is the outline of a 
piece that was put up with a large pat- 
tern of ornamentation, suitable for 
the purpose of these instructions. It 
is a wooden stand in the first place 
covered first with a smooth coating 
of stearine, then bordered and deco- 
rated with wax flowers and leaves. 
On top of the stand is a large platter 
containing a decorated galantine of 
turkey. 

To obtain the wooden stands apply 
to a cabinet maker, and have them 
made of a size to hold the dishes you 
intend to use. There should be a 
rim of wooden hooping around the 
edge both to hold the dish and to 
give room for the ornaments. These 
stands will very likely cost about one 
dollar each. They may be of differ- 
ent sizes, the stems measuring from 
six to twelve inches in height.

the stand, melt either 
wax, or parrafine, or 



To cover 
some white 

stearine, or mutton tallow, or a mix 
ture of wax and tallow. White wax 
can be and is used in that way and is 
cleanly, but it is expensive and hard 
to make a smooth surface with, on 
account of the high degree of heat 
required to keep it in a melted state. 
Mutton fat mixed with wax is a good 
material, but better still is the same 
stearine that candles are made of; it 
does not grease the fingers and has 



no smell. Wax costs from fifty cents 
to a dollar a pound while candles 
can be bougt at eight pounds for a 
dollar. Melt in a tin pan and pour 
it over the stand with a spoon. When 
the wood is everywhere covered 
hold the stand in front of a fire, 
turning: it about while the surplus fat 
drips off and leaves a smooth, even 
surface; then, when the stand has 
become cold and white take a hot 
knife and smooth off the edges and 
ridges that remain.

Fig. 3- 



Tree Designs for Game 
Pieces. 



But if the design is to be a tree 
select a natural bough from a tree or 
bush, something that branches hand- 
somely like a deer's horns with room 
in the forks to place a piece of wood 
as large as a plate or dish. Set the 
butt of it in a wooden bottom like 
that shown for the other kind of 
stand and fasten the upper shelf in 
the forks where the boar's head is to 
be, then proceed to coat over the 
entire stand and branches with stear- 
ine as in the other case. Coral 
branches and sea-weed designs can 
be prepared in a similar manner. 
When the stand is thus far prepared 
proceed to cover it with wax leaves, 
fruit, berries, flowers or any orna- 
mental shapes that may suit the sub- 
ject; the tree stand may be decorated 
with leaves and fruit on every twig. 



Wax Leaves and Flowers. 



The best material for flowers and 
leaves is white wax although stear- 
ine answers very well for some of the 



less delicate forms. They are made 
by carving a flower on a carrot or 
turnip or potato, dipping it into melt- 
ed wax and taking off the thin cover- 
ing of wax that the vegetable shape 
has taken up. Wax impressions are 
thinner and finer than stearine, and 
wax can be pulled gently off of in- 
tricate shapes where any other ma- 
terial would break to pieces. Veget- 
ables make the best shapes because 
wax will not adhere too tightly and 
they must be kept wet. 

Supposing Mrs. Butcher, men- 
tioned in the catalogue as having 
special skill m such work to have 
carved a white turnip into the form 
of a rose and the end of a carrot into 
the shape and markings of a rose 
leaf, the next step would be to throw 
them into a pan of water and then 
melt some white wax in a tin cup. 
Take up the turnip rose, dip the face 
of it in the wax, then immediately 
in the cold water again and a thin 
pearly waxen rose can be pulled off 
the vegetable; dip the leaf -shaped 
carrot the same way and you have 
a waxen leaf. The wax must not 
be very hot. When it is cool enough 
to be on the point of setting, the 



188 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



leaves and flowers caii be made with 
the greatest rapidity, sometimes drop- 
ping from the shape of themselves. 

By the same method fan-leaves, 
palms, bells, grape bunches, cups, 
thimbles, stars, faces, animals' heads, 
spear heads, cornices and mouldings 
can be made in great variety within 
certain restrictions which will soon 
be discovered upon trial, such as the 
impracticability of making a round 
ball-shaped flower, unless in two 
halves. 

It is best for a beginner to make 
a large number of very small flowers 
and leaves at first instead of large 
and heavy ones, the light ones being 
easy to fasten in place and less liable 
to fall off or be broken through pro- 
jecting too far from the stand. 



To Decorate the Stands. 

The flowers and leaves are fastened 
in place by melting a little stearine 
upon them, hold a rose to its place 
with the fingers of one hand while 
the other applies the point of a hot 
knife to the place of contact. They 
may also be dipped in melted stear- 
ine and pressed in place while it sets. 
Heavy ornaments require tape stems 
to be attached to support them on 
the edge of the stand. 

It is scarcely possible to improve 
upon the appearance of a well exe- 
cuted wax stand in pure pearly white, 
yet colored wax can be used and 
colored flowers made by the same 
methods. The material of which the 
colored candles on Christmas trees 
are made is suitable for the purpose. 
Wax stands with colored ornaments 
are suitable for comic designs like 
pigs in dress coats, and similar notions. 



Galantines and Aspics. 

Directions for preparing and or- 
namenting galantines and apics de 
foies-gras have been given at Nos. 
853, 860, and 943, and methods of 
ornamenting with colored jellies at 
No. 692 and succeeding numbers. 
Very particular directions for larger 
operations can also be found in the 
cold dishes department in the Amer- 
ican Pastry Cook. The ordinary 
galantine moulds are tin pans made 
oval instead of round and of sizes 
that run about one inch difference in 
diameter. But any other shape can 
be used as well if it only corresponds 
with the stand. A very fine supper 
with decorated dishes has been set 
where nothing but the common round 
glass cake stands were available ; but 
a number of them were covered with 
melted wax and then smothered in 
wax flowers till they had not the 
slightest semblance of a glass cake 
stand, and they required meat dishes 
and raised pies to be of round shape 
to match. , 



Broad Blocks and Crous- 
tades. 



In order to elevate a galantine 
into suflficient prominence above the 
ornaments a bread "block" may be 
employed or cake of cooked rice, 
according to the subject. Cut the 
bread to fit the dish, fry it in a kettle 
of oil or lard to a handsome light 
brown color. When cold dip it 
several times in bright jelly keeping 
it in ice between each dipping till a 
good coat of jelly remains upon it, 
place it in the dish and turn the de- 
corated galantine out of its mould on 
top of it. 

A very handsome dish or terrine 
of pdte-de-foie-gras can be made ii.

this way. Prepare a decorated stand 
with wax leaves and flowers. Cut 
three or four blocks of bread of dif- 
ferent sizes to make a pyramid and 
fry them to a nice deep yellow color 
and place them in their dish. Have 
some bright aspic jelly ready and 
chop it quite fine. Take a pan of 
liver paste (No. S6o will do for the 
purpose) and cut out pieces with 
spoons made hot in boiling water. 
The spoon will shape the liver paste 
like the half of an q^^ cut length- 
wise. As fast as cut out dredge 
them with the minced jelly, then 
place them around on the steps of 
the fried bread pyramid, covering it 
very nearly, and between the points 
insert triangular blocks of colored 
jelly and decorate with lemon baskets 
garnished with sprigs of parsley. 



Make Allowance for Heat. 



Much vexation and trouble over- 
takes every inexperienced hand who 
makes no allowance for the effects 
of a heated supper room upon the 
jellies which his refrigerator has kept 
in such a pleasant state of solidity, 



but after one or two catastrophes 
caused by the build-up dishes melt- 
ing down like snow in the sun the 
workman learns to make his goods 
doubly firm with plenty of gelatine 
to withstand the ordeal of a gas-lit 
and crowded hall. 



The Boar's Head. 

In the United States we have little 
or nything to do with the perpetua- 
tion of ancient customs and have 
little sympathy of sentiment with 
them that have. We are too ready 
to throw a wet blanket on every 
exhibition of the ancient fires by 
asking and continually asking : *' What 
is the use of it?" 

We are so accustomed to looking 
forward, to " the millions yet to be," 
to the new, to the cities which are 
springing up without permission from 
anybody, that we have forgotten 
about such things as the ancient 
granting of city charters by kings 
and barons with tributary conditions 
imposed, such as the presenting of a 
peacock, or a huge blackbird pie, or 
a boar's head to the suzeraine on a

certain day each year; and find it 
hard to enter into the solemn sort of 
fun which the very respectable and 
reverend seat of English learning, 
Oxford College, enjoys as an annual 
custom. A little better understand- 
ing of the symbolism of some of the 
designs would make even the exhi- 
bition of artistic cookery at the 
cook's annual banquets far more 
interesting than they are. 



THE OXFORD BOAR'S HEAD 
DINNER. 

The boar's head dinner at Queen's 
College, Oxford, on Christmas Day is a 
survival of a custom once prevalent in all 
England. In 1678, Aubrey wrote: "In 
gentlemen's houses at Christmas, the first 
dish that was brought to table was a boar's 
head, with a lemon in his mouth." There 
is an account of an Essex parish, called 
Homchurch, in which the inhabitants paid 
the great tithes on Christmas Day, and 
were treated with a bull and a brawn. The 
boar's head was wrestled for by the peasants 
on that occasion, and then feasted upon. 
It would be easy to multiply instances. 

At half-past six o'clock in the afternoon 
of Christmas Day, the Hall of Queens 
College was filled by persons anxious to 
witness the time-honoured ceremony of the 
Boar's Head procession. The hall was 
liberally adorned with greenery, and a 
monstrous fire created a welcome tempera- 
ture. Although the weather was damp and 
foggy, by six o'clock the picturesque old 
hall presented an animated appearance, 
filled nearly to overflowing with a crowd 
of merr} faces ; the dark tone of the gentle- 
men's clothing and the bright bits of colour 
of the ladies' showed up very effectually 
against the old oaken wainscoating. The 
boar's head, which was provided and dished 
up by Mr. Wm. H. Horn, the College 
manciple, was a splendid specimen, weigh- 
ing seventy pounds, and was decorated 
with the proverbial "bays and rosemary," 
and surmounted with a crown and flags 
bearing the College arms. Upon the 
sound of the trumpet, at the head of the 
procession of singing men and choristers, 
marched the Rev. Robt Powley, M. A., 
Curate of Cowlev, who took the solo part 
in the " Boar's rfead Carol :" 



j The Boar's head in hand bear I. 

Bedecked with bays and rosemary, 
And I pray you, masters, merry be, 
Quotquot estis in convivio. 
Chorus. 
Caput Apri defero, 
Redden iaudes Domino. 

The Boar's head, as I understand, 
Is the bravest dish in the land; 
Being' thus decket with g^ay garland, 
Let us servire cantico. 
Chorus. 
Our Steward has provided this 
In honour of the King of Bliss, 
Which on this day to be served is 
In Reginensi Atro. 

Chorus. 
Wynkin de Worde's carol (printed in 
1 521) was, of course, much quainter, espe- 
cially verse three : 

Be gladde, lordes, both more and lesse, 
For this hath ordeyned our stewarde 

To chere you all this Christmasse, 
The Boar's heed with mustarde. 

A distribution of leaves which garnished 
the dish was then made by the Provost (Dr. 
Magrath). The custom of serving up the 
boar's head at Queen's College has been ob- 
served for about 500 years, one authority 
quoting 1350 as being the probable year of 
the first festival. — London Caterer. 

The man whose office requires 
him to provide a boar's head in the 
orthodox fashion for such an occasion 
as that described, be he "manciple" 
steward or cook, must feel a greater 
importance attaching to the task than 
if it were the most elaborate of tran- 
sient party dinners. A dozen or 
more of boar's heads were shown at 
the London Exhibition. They are 
equally prominent in continental dis- 
plays. The narratives of continental 
history as well as fiction abound in 
recitals of wild boar hunts, in the 
Forest of Ardennes, in France, the 
Black Forest, in Germany. A boar's 
head a la St. Hubert is among the 
highest achievements a chef in orna- 
mental work can set himself to 
accomplish. St. Hubert is the patron 
saint of hunters. The piece is a 
boar's head, the bones taken out, 
stuffed, cooked, set up in the likeness 
of life, glazed, ornamented, placed 
upon a stand, set amongst waxen or 
silver-plated branches of a tree, 
decorated with bays and hunting 



COOKING FOR PROFIT.

horns and spears and heads of hounds. 
The carcass of a real wild boar from 
the Black Forest was displayed at 
the Exhibition, much as a grizzly 
bear from the Rocky Mountains 
might be displayed in this country. 
It was an object of curiosity and 
interest and was immediately pur- 
chased by the steward of a large 
establishment. 



BOAR'S HEAD GALANTINES. 



For practice in putting up a boar's 
head the beginner should bone and 
cook pigs' heads to serve cold, until 
he has become familiar with the 
methods of making them good and 
of putting them in shape. One or 
two heads a week would be esteemed 
a luxury in any hotel among the 
regular cold dishes. For there was 
no foolishness about the ancient lik- 
ing for a hogs head and it is con- 
sidered as good eating to-day as it 
ever was, but requires a good deal 
of the cook. It must be partly salted, 
it must have the superabundant fat 
cut out and lean and brawn supplied 
instead; it must be carefully seasoned 
and cojked until perfectly tender 
and the liquor it is boiled in is jelly. 
Choose a large head for the purpose 
and a small one to stuff it with. Cut 
it as far back as the shoulder bones 
of the hog to get as much of the 
neck as possible. Begin at the throat 
and cut the meat from the bone 
without cutting through the skin; 
take out the tongue, put them both 
into the corned beef brine (No. 650) 
to remain two or three days. Then 
take them out, wash and trim, and 
cut away all the fat of the jowls. 
Sew up the mouth and throat. Place 
the small head similarly boned and 
prepared inside the large one, fill in 
with tongues cut in strips and some 
well seasoned pork sausage meat, 



cover in the neck with the rind of 
pickled pork, then sew the stuffed 
head in a cloth, boil it four or five 
hours, take it up and press it in a 
suitable mould and set it away to 
become cold. After that take off 
the cloth, remove the threads and 
slice the meat to serve. 



TO MAKE AN ORNAMENTAL DISH. 

It is not essential that a boar's head 
shall always be set up with ears erect 
and mouth open, it may be a smooth 
rounded dish of meat only having 
the general outline of the head shape, 
and to form it that way it is neces- 
sary to take the cooked head out of 
the cloth it was boiled in when it is 
nearly cold, then take a long muslin 
bandage and wrap around it, draw- 
ing tight in one place and slack in 
another to give the head the proper 
form, then set it in the refrigerator 
to become solid in that shape. After- 
wards, take off the bandage, wipe 
off with a cloth dipped in hot water, 
then glaze the head by frequent 
basting with jelly in a cold place 
until it is covered, or, glazed with 
meat essence, and- ornament with 
cubes and patterns in aspic. 



AS NATURAL AS LIFE. 



"Rosemary and bays" always 
mentioned in connection with the 
boar's head, belong to that dish by 
association as holly belongs to Christ- 
mas. They are both used for sea 
sonmg as well as for green decora- 
tions. Rosemary is a herb that looks 
like pine leaves and has a flavor like 
a mixture of sage and spruce fir. 
Season the boar's head that is to be 
put up in shape with rosemary and 
bay leaves powdered, instead of the 
customary sage. To form the head 
as natural as life and even moie

ferocious looking it is best to employ 
a plaster mould which can be made 
shortly before it is to be used and 
will serve for many repetitions. It 
is to be observed that the wild boar 
carries a high and bristly forehead 
and the mould is to be managed so 
as to throw the top of the head into 
prominence instead of the fat jowls 
of common hogs. Choose a head of 
a large porker to make a cast from. 
It is not advisable to have the mould 
too large because the cooked head 
shrinks so much it is difficult to 
thoroughly fill a large mould. Hav- 
ing the raw head cut off with all the 
neck belonging, cut off the ears, 
place it snout downwards and resting 
on the bottom in a tin pail or five 
gallon tin lard can. Get half a 
bushel of plaster of paris, which 
costs about seventy-five cents at the 
cement stores, stir it up with water 
to a thin paste and pour it around 
the head in the pail. In half an 
hour the plaster sets and becomes 
solid, but leave it alone several hours, 
and then the head can be drawn out 
and you have a plaster mould of it. 
Perhaps the mould can be improved 
in shape by scraping down with a 
knife, and the bottom of the pail or 
can should be cut through that the 
snout of the cooked head may be 
drawn in. 

Prepare a salted head with stuffing 
as before directed, leave the ears on 
and lay them flat on the top of the 
head. Sew up the head in muslin 
closely wrapped and without any 
thick folds or knots. Boil four hours, 
take up and let drain and partly cool 
off, then place it still in the cloth in 
the mould, taking care that the ears 
are in the right place and the .snout 
goes well to the bottom. In that 
position with the neck above the top 
of the mould, place weight upon it 
and leave it in press in a cold place 



for twelve hours. It can be with- 
drawn from the mould easily by 
means of the cloth, which is then to 
be taken off, the head wiped off with 
a cloth in warm water, the ears 
raised up, softened with a hot cloth, 
shaped as wanted and upheld by a 
small silver skewer in each; the 
mouth opened and tusks inserted; 
bead eyes put in and the head glazed 
and ornamented. 

The tusks finely curved may be 
obtained from almost any hog's head. 
Find one with small tusks projecting, 
boil the jaw bones, then break the 
bones with a hammer about the 
roots and the tusks will be found 
three or four inches long. 



Decorated Cakes. 



There is evidently a laborious 
effort to discover something mar- 
velous to put upon a cake when a 
resort is had to flexible glass, satin 
sashes, panel paintings and various 
sorts of millinery in addition to the 
plaster of paris and gum paste figures 
and structures which are perennial as 
cake ornaments. These things come 
high but they must have them at the 
London Exhibitions and they do not 
interest pastry cooks and bakers 
much because all such methods are 
outside of their trade. When a cake 
has to be carried to the glass-blow- 
er's, the landscape gardener's, the 
upholsterer's, the milliner's, the image 
maker's, and the painter's places, the 
baker may throw his slipper after it 
for luck but he need not go with it. 
It is none of his work to do. 

There were prize medals offered 
for the best decorated Christmas 
cake and best wedding cake, and 
Messrs. Newton & Eskell, proprie- 
tors of the Caterer offered a special 
prize in that department. This was

awarded to a firm of " country cate- 
rers," from Leamington, who came 
to the great city and took the premi- 
um with a cake that was remarkable 
for its elaborate piping in sugar 
icing, which is true pastry cook's and 
confectioner's work; and the gem of 
the exhibition in bride cakes is said 



beyond the sphere of the w^orkman 
who makes the cake to carry it to 
such a completion. It is a trade to 
itself to make the gum paste struc- 
tures with altars and leaves and 
flowers which we see exhibited for 
sale under glass cases at the confec- 
tioners in every large city. Pastry

itself was already ornamented in

make flowers.

practice in which will lead the 
learner on to a trial of all the addi- 
tional branches. 

The engraving on the preceding 
page shows the design of cake deco- 
rated in the Grecian style that once 
came under the powerful protection 
of no less a person than General 
Grant, whose interference prolonged 
its existence at 
least two days. 
The hand that 
was extended to 
make a breach 
in the upper 
works was Mrs. 
Grant's. That 
serene lady 
would have 
broken off one 
of the white 
birds which 
were hovering 
in the act of sip- 
ping the crim- 
son jelly in the 
glasses. The 
general put his 
hand on hers 
and pushed it 
aside saying: 
"Don't break 
that." "I want 
to try the con- 
fectionery,"said 
the lady. 

"There is plenty without — don't 
break it — ," said he again ; and it was 
saved to appear again next day ivith 
sections cut out of both the lower cake 
and the upper one on two sides, the 
cake sliced and part of the slices 
replaced, and all was done ivithout 
breaking the ornamentation^ which 




requires but a small foundation to 
stand upon. The lower cake was 
made by the recipe No. 836, the 
upper was a white citron cake. 

Over the top of the pyramid, which 
was all pure white and lace-like, was 
thrown a long and slender vine of 
I Virginia creeper, much handsomer 
i than smilax because of the finely 
tapering grada- 
tions of the leaf 
sizes, and these 
were just turned 
to vivid colors 
by the touch of 
the first October 
frost.*) 

This is a pic- 
ture of the cake 
that was made 
and ornamented 
in haste and 
under difficul- 
ties for the 
wedding of the 
banker's daugh- 
ter, as hurriedly 
sketched at No. 
941. It took 
about four hours 
of a summer 
night to put up 
^^ those ornaments 
in sugar icing. 
There were, of 
course, more 
people concerned in that wedding 
than it was business of mine to men- 
tion at such a hard-working time, 
and among them was the young 
lady's father, the banker himself; 
and when the table was set and the 
time was right to bring along the 
wedding presents he walked up and 



* [That was perhaps the happiest period of General Grant's life. He was spending- a week with 
his family and officers of his staff and their wives at the Maniton House, Manitou Springes, Colorado. 
He loved that locality, this was his third visit to it; it was in the third vear of his first term as President, 
an office of which he' was wi-arv and he delig^hted the people of Manitou villag-e by declarin^^ his intention 
of returning' and making his home there when his term was ended. He went around the world after 
that and after all he visited Manitou once more, though only for a day, when on his way to Leadviile, 
where he had thought of investing in the mines.]

took out of his breast pocket the title 
deed to a forty-thousand-dollar house

daughter's name; he rolled up the 
document and placed it under the 
lid of the basket and left it there. 
The hostess put into the basket on

in a gold pencil case, then the children 
climbed on chairs and filled the basket 
and all the spaces with white flowers 



which they had been out at sunrise 
to all the neighbours' gardens to 
gather. When the bride came to 
cut the cake she shed tears on the 
flowers, hung the pencil case on her 
watch-chain, put the thimble on her 
finger and tucked the title deed down 
in the bosom of her dress. And 
the children ate both the basket and 
the pedestal because it was all sugar 
and flavored with lemon.

The photographer remarked that " it

three or four different ways to get 
the best expression of it. The pure 



white and fragile structure was orna- 
mented with bright colored sugar 
flowers set upon it and around the 
edges and in the spaces. It was an 
ornamented cake made to serve as a 
center piece among some elaborate 
floral decorations at a party supper 



198 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



given by a lady of Atlanta, Georgia. 
The design was Jinishcd for the 
purpose by having" the stands and 
baskets filled up with bonbons^ maca- 
roons^ kisses, and the lightest kinds 
of fancy small cakes, and was hung 
with trailing sprays of smilax. In 
such positions these tall pieces harmo- 
nize most perfectly with floral deco- 
rations, the effect of which they 
highten without being too obtrusive 
and without the least suggestion of 
children's play-house figures such as 
attaches to the gum paste temples 
and pavilions of the ordinary style. 



HOW THEY ARE MADE. 



For a single stand take two sheets 
of note paper and keeping them 
doubled as they are, cut out a scroll 
pattern with a pair of scissors, which 
when opened out will be like this: 




Fig. 5. 
Cut them apart down the back and 
you have four paper patterns like that 
on the left side of the cut. Take a 
tin plate and melt some white wax 
and mutton tallow in equal parts, dip 
the paper patterns in it and lay them 
each one on a separate piece of board 



or a shinsfle. Then mix 



up 



stiff icing (directions at No. 464) and 
lay a piping border on the edge 



around the outline of the pattern; 
use a star piping tube and lay a 
wreath pattern on the waxed paper 
as shown at the right of the cut, ob- 
serving that as the extremely light 
and graceful effect of these designs 
is largely due to the spaces left be- 
tween the piping, the icing must not 
be run together nor placed too close. 
As fast as they are done place them 
to dry in some such place as inside an 
oven after the fire has gone out. 
When dry turn them over, warm 
them till the wax begins to melt and 
then pull of the paper pattern. Now 
repeat the same pattern of icing ^ on 
this side where the paper was and 
when that is dry and hard on all 
four you have the four scrolls to set 
up as a support for the basket. 




To fasten them together so that 
they will stand square and perpen- 
dicular it is necessary to procure a 
small goods box and break off one 
side with one end attached. Lay 
two of the pieces on the wood as at 
figure 5, but a quarter inch space 
between them, lay some icing on the 
edges, then place a third one on edge 
on top of them and all three touch- 
ing the end piece of the board, which 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



190 



is upright and acts as a square, and 
set it in a warm place to dry again 
while you work on another part. 
When dry set it upright and place 
the fourth side in place; it will stand 
with no support but a touch of icing; 
and when again dry the stand thus 
far made can be set upon the cake. 

To make baskets or brackets use 
shallow plates or jelly cake pans 
'waxed over and cover them with 
piping, the more open and lace-like 
the better. Ornament the outer 
edges as cakes are piped, and when 
thoroughly dry warm the plate till 
the thin coating of wax that it was 
dipped in melts and the shape of 
icing can be lifted off and placed on 
its stand. The handle of the basket 
can be formed on a piece of tin bent 
to a bow shape. Make it in two 
pieces with broad foundations, set 
them up on the basket and fasten the 
middle with some icing and a rose 
and leaves. 

To build such a design two or 
three stories high use a sheet of 
foolscap for the lower pattern and a 
sheet of note paper for the next, or, 
let each upper stand be one-third 
smaller than that below it. 

The patterns can be varied and 
multiplied according to the ingenuity 
and patience of the operator. The 
pieces are fragile yet will bear a 
heavy weight of flowers, cakes and 
fruit carefully placed. It is said of 
these objects that they are fresh and 
new — the people have seen all sorts 
of ornamented cakes all over the 
country, but all more or less alike, 
but never saw any like these, and 
that is where the advantage is gained, 
as one can be made for every* table 
in a dining room and each of a dif- 
ferent form, without any very great 
expenditure of time, when we are in 
practice. 

To make icing tougher and less 



liable to break add gelatine dissolved, 
or gum arable, and for further in- 
structions for such as have had no 
practice the American Pastry Cook 
should be consulted and directions 
compared before any work is under- 
taken that might lead to failure at a 
time when success should be assured. 



PATTERNS ON TINFOIL. 



Tinfoil paper such as tobacco and 
similar merchandise is wrapped in 
can be used instead of the waxed 
paper recommended in foregoing 
directions. Lay a covering of tinfoil 
on the outside of a bowl turned up- 
side down, lay a piping pattern on it 
for a basket or other object; let it 
dry and turn right side up and after 
removing gently from the bowl the 
tinfoil can be carefully picked away 
as the icing does not adhere to it. 
The learner can practice both ways 
and decide for himself which he has 
most success with. 



RAISED BORDER ORNAMENTS. 



Palisade or garden fence patterns 
of icing to set around a cake can be 
made as directed for the bowed 
basket handles. Make a hoop of 
tin and wax it with mixed wax ^nd 
mutton fat, set it on a board and 
make the pattern upon it in panels or 
pieces divided at convenient distances. 
When dry take off the pieces by 
warming the tin, and set the border 
around the edge of the cake. The 
tin hoop must of course be made to 
fit the cake. 

Another way requiring more prac- 
tice and a steady hand is to take a 
cake already iced over and quite dry, 
turn it upside down upon something 
like a gallon tomato can, then with 



200 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



your piping tube hang a loop or 
fringe border all round the edge. 
Dry that and then put on another 
row of loop border, and continue till 
you have four or five tiers. Let it 



get perfectly dry and then turn the 
cake right side up and if you have 
no accident you have a raised lace- 
work border around the cake which 
raises a wonder as to how it was done. 






Pyramids of Small Cakes. 

Height 20 to 24 inches. 



Have a tin shape made like that 
on the left, with a wired rim on the 
bottom to keep it firm and several 
tin circles also rimmed to keep them 
from yielding and breaking the 
pyramid, and have them large enough 
to lift easily without binding on the 
shape. Cover the tin circle on the 
edge with a lace cake paper and slip 
over the top. Grease the pyramid 
shape and then build up lady fingers. 



almond fingers, meringues, cocoanut 
caramels or anything of the sort by 
dipping the edges in melted clear 
candy, or in cake icing. When set 
lift the pyramid off the shape, still 
resting on the tin ring and place it on 
a cake stand. The most beautiful 
object of this sort is a pyramid 
of kiss meringues perfectly made, 
and covered with a veil of spun 
sugar. 



Another Exhibition. 



The London managers while yet 
sore over the unsatisfactory results of 
this one are asking each other if 
there shall be another and they are 
disposed to answer yes. However 
that may come out there will probably 



be such an exhibition opened in the 
United States and it will be success- 
ful for it will be arranged and carried 
out by hotel-keeping men for the 
furtherance of hotel - keeping inter- 
ests. 



COOKING FOR PROFIT,

There are two distinct classes of 
cooks and two different lines of cook- 
ing, they are the chefs who cook for 
my lord the Marquis of Carrabas and 
his noble compeers on the one side, 
and the chefs who manage large 
kitchens and numerous subordinates 
and who count the meals they send 
out by the thousands a day on the 
other, and the American Cookery 
Exhibition will regard the latter cla^s 
and their work as the matter of 
greatest public interest and will 
stimulate them to seek methods of 
greater variety and perfection in 
serving the complete individual din- 
ners of the modern hotel and restau- 
rant system. There were ideas in 
the London exhibition which will 
perhaps have to be brought over to 
this side for development. There 
was the national dinner idea but too 
pinched and narrow; the prize table 
setting, but on a private house basis; 
the prize napkin-folding, but no 
waiter's drill nor prize waiter work ; 
there were little dishes made by 
amateur cooks, but no contests of 
veterans of the table cChote system ; 
there were two days of fitful interest 
over a display of ornamental pieces 
which resulted in dissatisfaction over 
the awards of prizes and while even 
this was being but poorly attended 
there were a thousand " temperance 
lunch houses," "coffee taverns," 



"oyster houses," "railway eating sta- 
tions," "chop houses," restaurants 
and hotels of every description where 
the real cookery exhibitions were 
going on and in which the public 
were really interested which had no 
more part nor lot in the Aquarium 
exhibition than if it had been in some 
distant country. They are all inter- 
ested in the art of cooking for large 
numbers but not in pieces montees. 
There was one good idea of a hotel 
cook who entered for exhibition three 
sauces, but little known; that idea 
will be amplified in the American 
exhibition into a show and sampling 
of all known sauces. There will be 
a display, for prizes, of the best ways 
the best cooks have invented of orna- 
menting the individual dishes of each 
separate hotel dinner; there will be 
prizes for the best ten ways of cook- 
ing certain specified articles of diet 
and the requirement of the proper 
name attached to every dish. There 
will be exhibitions of rapid waiter- 
work given at dinners served to 
members at nominal prices for this 
purpose, and the specially ornamental 
cooks who set out very grand ban- 
quet tables but never succeed in 
getting their patrons half waited upon, 
will have the opportunity to look on 
and learn how meals are served to 
hundreds or thousands at once.

Suggestions for the Decoration of Small Dishes. 

For Restaurant Orders and Course Dinners. 



Cases {caisses^ of various shapes 
can be made by a simple method 
similar to that of making a kind of 
crisp waffle. It is well enough to 
have the iron or copper shapes but 
they are not indispensable. Take 
common tin patty-pans, mix up a 
pancake batter or the same as used 
for pineapple fritters, that is rather 
thin ; even flour batter-cake will do. 
Make some lard hot, dip the patty- 
pans in, then dip the outsides in the 
batter, drop into the lard and fry 
slowly. Soon the batter becomes 
dry and crisp like a shell. Pull it 
off, drain on paper, dip the patty- 
pans again until you have enough. 
Use these shells or cases instead of 
puff-paste patties to fill with stewed 
terrapin or scrambled brains, ragout 
of chicken liver, etc. Very small 
ones as thin as paper can be used to 
set around a dish, some filled with 
grated horseradish, others W\\\\Tnaitre 
d'hote/ butter, with peas or aspaj-a- 
gus points. Other shells or cases are 



made by shaping rice croquettes or 
potato croquettes in any desired form, 
egging and breading them either 
once or twice and frying as usual. 
When done of a handsome clear 
brown color cut out the top and re- 
move the inside and fill up with 
minced chicken, minced kidneys, any 
curry mixture or ragout, giblets,, 
sweetbreads or brains. 

Another resource for small orna- 
mental dishes is the carving of raw- 
potatoes, sweet potatoes and turnips 
into shapes like cups or tumblers, fry 
them slowly in lard or oil enough to 
cover them till done, drain on paper, 
sprinkle with salt and use them in 
the ways above described. 

Similar shapes may be cut out of 
bread and fried in the same way. 

The common method of orna- 
menting a spoonful of meat and 
sauce in an individual dish with a 
heart-shaped or leaf-shaped crouton 
of fried bread is good with the excep- 
tion of being too common. The 



204 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



common fault is to cut the shapes 
too large and out of bread sliced too 
thick. They should be dipped some- 
times in bright sauce and parsley- 
dust and be set up leaning against 
the meat as well as bordering the 
dish. 

Similar thin pieces of fried bread 
may be set up on end around a dish, 
fastened by being dipped in q%% and 
placed while the dish is hot; the 
meat is then to be dished in the 
middle. A very handsome border 
can be made of duchesse potato mix- 
ture or balls set around, carefully 
egged over and the top slightly baked 
by setting on the top shelf. 

Another is made by making a 
firm puree by rubbing green peas 
through a sieve. Dip a teaspoon in 
hot butter and with it dip up small 
egg-shapes and place in order around 
the dish. Lemons to go with salmon 
steak or fried oysters may be cut in 
basket shapes with scolloped edges. 
Beets may be stamped out with fancy 
cutters. There should not be too 
much crowding. One of the most 



effective ornaments for a salad is a 
strip or two of blood beet in vinegar 
cut with a scollop potato knife, small, 
like a common lead pencil in size, 
but serrated, and laid on top of the 
salad. 

A little ornamental effect can be 
given to all the ordinary individual 
dishes at dinner by placing the meats 
diagonally in the dish; the rice may 
be placed slanting across one side and 
end of a dish and the curry in the 
same lengthened form in the remain- 
ing space just as well as shapelessly 
bunched up at each end or mixed, 
and the green peas with a croquette 
may as well lie in two diagonal lines 
alongside of it as to be in a promis- 
cous pile. Don't try too many expe- 
riments. One new wrinkle a week 
is enough. But remember that some 
big reputations and big salaries are 
made through the assiduous follow- 
ing up of all the advantages afforded 
by a cultivated taste for ornamenta- 
tion rather than from any real differ- 
ence in the cooking that is behind it

CAMOVITO'S DINNERS. 

Because all large dinners in New 
York are given at Delmonico's, the 
Brunswick, the Fifth Avenue or the 
Hoffman House, it is an error to 
suppose that a really artistic table- 
spread is never produced outside of 
those establishments. Steward Ca- 
movito, of the Union League club, 
has arranged some dinners that have 
never been excelled in this town. 
The members of the club consider 
him a genius in his way. President 
Grant's dinner to Diaz, before refer- 
red to, was a case in point. Photo- 
graphs of the big, round table made 
especially for the purpose, taken just 
before the guests set down, give but 
a faint idea of their magnificence. 
At the dinner Senator Evarts gave 
to the French naval visitors and the 
Bartholdi committee, not long ago, 
Camovito's model of the statue of 
Liberty was a triumph of the confec- 
tioner's skill. He surrounded Bedloe's 
Island with natural water clear as 
cr}'stal, had the Isere and French 
war ships riding at anchor, and 
illuminated Liberty's torch with a 
little incandescent lamp that sparkled 
like a diamond in a lady's ring. At 
the Wiman dinner he bridged the 
Arthur Kill with a towering struc- 
ture of gelatine and sugar with a 
train of Baltimore and Ohio cars 



crossing it, and he set afloat a ferry- 
boat of white sugar to carry the 
passengers that Mr. Wiman hopes to 
capture from the Pennsylvania road 
if his air castle don't break down. 
Camovito spends as much time and 
care over planning a big dinner as 
some architects do over designing a 
new house. He told me once that 
he often laid awake nights thinking 
over some litte surprise peculiarly 
applicable to the occasion of the din- 
ner or the guest of the evening. To 
be sure he gets well paid for it, and 
he ought to. He is one of the dozen 
or more chefs in New York who 
can command as high a salary as a 
successful preacher. 



The tables were appropriately 
decorated when the Boston Com- 
mercial Club gave a dinner to some 
railroad men. The central piece re- 
presented a complete train, with 
engine and tender two feet high, 
made entirely of roses, pinks, violets, 
and other flowers. It extended nearly 
half across the President's table.

was in the form of a watermelon, 
and when cut, the deception was 
excellently preserved. 



At a luncheon given by the Vis- 
countess Combermere the table de- 
corations consisted of a carpet of 
moss dotted with real primroses. In 
the centre rose a bank of moss, upon 
which was a gold efergne filled with 
oranges, relieved by little bunches of 
primroses. The edge of the table 
was trailed and framed with ivy. 

For a ladies' lunch party in a 
fashionable New York hotel, a novel 
idea was introduced. Roses were 
frozen in a large cake of ice, which 
was placed on a mat of smilax. The 
effect was as if these were standing 
in water. 



A TIN Y — very tiny — pig was 
served at a fashionable dinner, the 
other evening; and when he was 
placed on the table a howl went up 
from the assembled rank and fashion 
surrounding him. The little beast 
stood on his own hoofs in the midst 
of a bed of Marshal Neil roses; in 
his rosy snout was the customary 
lemon, and twisted in his small tail 
was a blue pond lily! How her chef 
accomplished this feat the hostess 
refused to divulge, and though pork 
is not usually admitted, in any form, 
into good society, Mr. Piggy — who 
was pronounced too sweet for any- 
thing — was duly cut up and tasted, 
and the health of the Chinese cook 
duly drank in champagne. 



A COSTLY DINNER. 

Count Horace de Viel - Castel, 
whose memoirs were recently pub- 
lished, was a decided gourmand. 
He made a bet once that he would 



eat a dinner, the cost of w^hich would 
not be less than 500 fr. The menu, 
which he prepared for the occasion, 
was as follows: 

Potage a I'essence de gibier. 
Laitances de carpe au Xeres. 

Cailles desossees en caisse. 

Truite de lac de Geneve. 

Faisan roti barde d'ortolans. 

Pyramide de truffes entieres. 

Compote de fruits et stilton. 

VINS. 

Tokay, johannisberg, glace, clos-vougeot 
1819, chypre de la Commanderie. 

He won the wager, going about a 
hundred francs above the stipulated 
price. He left not a remnant of any 
dish, nor a drop of wine, and, strange 
to say, was able to spend the rest of 
the evening with Earl Granville at 
the British Embassy. 



WINE SERVICE. 



The proper service of wines is a 
study of itself; but we may say 
generally that sherry should be 
poured with the soup, white wines 
with the fish, champagne with the 
roast and claret all through the din« 
ner. Choice Burgundy comes in 
with the game, and a glass of fine 
Madeira finishes the dinner. Liquors 
and brandy are offered with or after 
the coffee. It is the pleasant custom 
now to offer mineral waters with the 
wine. Appollinaris has been called 
the Presidential beverage since the 
days of Mrs. Hayes, and for those 
who can not drink wine it is a very 
ofood substitute. 



Kitchen gossips say that $6,000 
worth of unused "stuff" was taken 
from Vanderbilt's house the day after 
the ball. 



In a corner of those magnificent 
markets of Paris, called Halles Cen- 
tralles, you may behold a strange

sight every morning between six 
o'clock and noon. Half a dozen 
large stalls there, bright with gilding 
and varnish, luxurious with marble, 
well- furnished, with lusty shop girls, 
display the remnant of yesterday's 
banquet — plates of soup; bits of fish 
half picked, with the sauce still round 
them ; fragments of pates and sweets ; 
liquefied ices; fragments of game; 
and costly viands formless, heaped 
together. These are the leavings of 
a grand restaurant or a ministerial 
dinner, sold by the officer to whom 
such perquisities belong. Too proud 
is he to touch them himself; but 
round the counter you will see a few 
workmen, mostly red - nosed, and 
shaggy, the wives of many more, 
and a crush of threadbare individuals 
of that class one would rather see by 
daylight than by dark. It is not 
that these broken meats, as far as I 
have noticed, are particularly cheap. 
Five pennyworth of beef would give 
more strength than ten plates of 
melted ice and sauce congealed. But 
the worn out stomachs of such people 
crave high seasoning and strong 
taste, which the beef would not give 
them. So they take away in bits of 
newspaper a franc's worth of wretch- 
ed dainties, and eat them with a 
scowl and curse against " the rich."

No. 9 DoYERS Street, this city, 
may aptly be called a hotel for the 
extremely poor. It is under the 
management of the Sanitary Aid 
Society of the Tenth Ward. Board- 
ers are entertained at nominal prices. 



The three upper floors are full of 
bunks, similar to those on a ship, 
covered over with clean white linen. 
A charge of ten cents is made for 
each one of these beds a night, in- 
cluding a warm bath, which is made 
a necessity by the rules of the insti- 
tution. Breakfast is furnished for 
three and five cents, and dinner for 
ten cents. Each lodger is compelled 
to register his name, give age, occupa- 
tion, and tell whether married or 
single before he can get a ticket for 
a bed. This is the only institution 
of its kind in the city, but efforts are 
being made to establish more as soon 
as possible. As the house is self- 
supporting money invested is not 
lost, but pays a good percentage. 



On the bills of fare in New York 
Italian restaurant's coffee is i cent per 
cup; steaks, chops and stews, 3 cents; 
pastry, 3 cents; beer, 2 cents; whisky 
and brandy, 3 cents. These places 
are thronged daily by persons of all 
nationalities. 



So-called English chop houses 
are springing up in all parts of the 
city of New York. Their popu- 
larity increases constantly. Three 
or four years ago there was only half 
a dozen good chop houses. Now 
there are a score or more and they 
are all of them flourishing. The 
slapbang, greasy, noisy and rushing 
restaurant, with its dozens of tables, 
soiled linen, slouchy negro waiters 
and miserable kitchen, has given way 
to neat and commodious little chop 
houses, with well polished tables, 
quiet waiters and excellent cooks. 
They sell nothing but chops, steaks, 
potatoes, beer and ale, and the service 
is characterized by cleanliness and 
promptness. The prices are quite 
reasonable.

COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



The five-cent lunch places in lower 
Broadway, N. Y., are getting more 
numerous and more popular. The 
proprietor of one of them said to a 
Tribune XQ.^QxX.Q.r\ " For nearly half 
a century cheapness in New York, 
for nearly everything, but especially 
eating, has been synonymous with 
dirt. It was my idea in opening this 
place to make it absolutely clean and 
neat, the food wholesome and tooth- 
some, and the price so reasonable 
that I should get not only the multi- 
tude who are obliged to buy five-cent 
lunches, but that other class who pay 
a higher price to get something clean. 
I hit it, and so have the other places 
of this kind. I have enlarged my 
place twice since coming here, and 
shall enlarge it again as soon as the 
present tenants vacate a room next 
to me.'' 



A MOVEMENT is now ''n very suc- 
cessful operation m Bordeaux to sup- 
ply workingmen with wholesome, 
well-cooked and substantial meals at 
a low cost. To this end a number 
of restaurants have been started in 
various parts of the city by a certain 
company, which is backed by the 
moral support of the medical frater- 
nity, the churches and the health 
authorities. In the course of a flying 
trip to Bordeaux last week, writes a 
correspondent, I visited one of these 
restaurants. The bill of fare served 
and the cost per item were as fol- 
lows: A large plate of vegetable 
soup, cost two cents; two large slices 
of bread, two cents; a plate of red 
haricot beans, two cents; a plate of 
roast veal, four cents; a plate of rice, 
one cent; half a bottle of vin ordi- 
naire^ four cents. Thus a very fair 
and liberal dinner — there was no 
stinting in the amount sei^ved — was 
to be obtained for 1 15 cents. This 



might serve as a hint to New York. 
What can be made a successful busi- 
ness, where almost every article of 
food is taxed, ought to pay in New 
York, where meat and nearly all 
kinds of food are cheaper. Surely 
a good warm dinner of this charac- 
ter, served at a comfortable table, is 
a boon to the artisan. 



ONE-CENT BREAKFAST. 

The head master of the Board 
School at Wallsend, seeing so much 
distress about, and that many of the 
children attending his school were 
badly prepared to face the lessons of 
the day for want of sufficient food at 
home, and being, it is said, a firm be- 
liever in oatmeal, once the chief of 
"Scotia's food," determined to do 
something on his own account with- 
out waiting for " a committee." So 
he ordered a good supply of oatmeal 
from a mill in Berwickshire, of the 
finest quality. The cooking opera- 
tions commenced at 6: 30 a. m., and 
the porridge is allowed to boil for 
fifty minutes, and is cooled and ready 
for serving out at 8: 15. Each child 
is supplied with about a pint of por- 
ridge — more or less, according to 
size and appetite — and a little more 
than half a gill of good skimmed 
milk. About one hundred and twenty 
children are thus receiving breakfast 
at a cost of about one-half penny 
each, and in most cases they are 
given free. In times gone by oat- 
meal was also the staple food of the 
North of England; it will be curious 
if it comes again into use. Its value 
as regards nutrition for children is 
beyond dispute. High wages have 
conduced to a high class though not 
better food for the working class.

The New York Hotel Reporter 
makes the following remarks upon 
country or seaside boarding. 

" As a general thing the city 
boarder wants the full value of his 
money when sojourning in the coun- 
try, and is hard to please. He will 
criticise the meat and say that it can- 
not be compared with that which he 
gets in the city. This may be true, 
if he really gets first rate city food. 
Our opinion is that the farmer's wife 
who takes boarders should confine 
herself to those dishes which she 
knows how to cook well — to the 
stews and the pot-pies. Her deserts 
should be ample puddings, especially 
in the season of fruits, the city 
boarder, who is always hungry in 
the country, does not care for thin 
and stingy little slices of cake and a 
spoonful of sweetmeats. The prob- 
lem usually is, where can we have 
still salt water bathing and boating, 
shade, a quiet farmhouse where the 
people go to bed early, and where 
the food is plentiful, without being 
extravagantly fine, at a cheap price? 
These questioners always have chil- 
dren, big and little. The busy board- 
ing-house of popular seaside resorts 
are not suitable for people who are 
disposed to be quiet and do not wish 
to be kept awake until after mid- 
night by the banging of a cracked 
piano, by silly laughter and by noisy 
dancing. So that the quiet family 
which should like to be in a farmer's 
house on a still bay, with both a 
beach and shady trees, finds itself 
hard to please, especially when it 
wishes to pay about five dollars a 
head. The farmer's wife who has 
such a place is usually shy of board- 
ers, and looks at them as if they are 
always dissatisfied, and is not dis- 
posed to take them at all. If she is, 
we have not heard of her at all. But 
the papers will soon be full of adver- 



tisements of boarding places and 
people will be seeking for what they 
will never get. After all it is a 
problem. Who will explain?" 



THE PREVAILING DISCONTENT. 




It was a little country inn 

Without a bill-of.fare. 
They simply set forth what they had; 

Variety was spare. 

A man of cranky appetite 

Sat at this humble board, 
And was no sooner served than he 

Thus started in and jawed. 

" Take hence this hammered Dit of steak. 

«' Remove this old hen's legs. 
" Withdraw this bitter chicory — 

" And bring some scrambled eggs." 

"Alas!" replied the table girl, 
" To please you much I'd like. 

" Some little discontent prevails — 
" The hens are on a strike." 

" What is the cause?" the traveler asked. 

" It's simply this," she stated, 
" The plain glass nest egg's out of style. 

" They want'em decorated,^''

TO MAKE AN ASTONISHING EGG. 

Labouchere gives the following 
recipe for a monster Easter ^gg'. 
Take a dozen eggs, separate the 
whites from the yolks, which latter 
you pour into a small bladder well 
washed and thoroughly cleaned. 
Shape the bladder like a sphere, close 
it hermetically and plung it into boil- 
ing water. When the yolks are 
quite hard peel the bladder off; you 
will find them in the form of a ball, 
which you must place in a larger 
bladder, adding the whites. The 
yellow ball suspends itself naturally 
in the center of the whites. Close 
the bladder and plunge it into boil- 
ing water. When this monster egg 
is quite hard peel the bladder oS 
again. When you serve it place it 
in the center of a bowl of salad ; then 
cut it up and serve with the salad. 



Sun, heard of them then for the first 
time. He describes them, not very 
accurately, and states how the hostess 
buys them of a German woman, 
though they are usually made at home 
as wanted. The woman started the 
business, made such nice " nudels" 
and was so cleanly that she now sells 
enough to support herself and chil- 
dren. All through Pennsylvania 
"nudels" are much eaten, particu- 
larly in soup. In Lancaster, and 
other inland towns, they are sold in 
the market. They are kept by some 
of the Philadelphia grocers, and are 
frequently served at Philadelphia 
tables. They are one of the many 
excellent dishes to which the New 
Yorker is a comparative stranger. 
If Mr. Dana will come to Philadel- 
phia, and let me know of his coming, 
I will promise him " nudel" soup of 
home-made " nudels" for dinner. I 
think he spells the word wrong. It 
ought to be noodles. It is the cus- 
tom, when you have noodle soup, to 
dispose of from four to five plates at 
least. The chicken, which is boiled 
in the soup, comes afterwards to 
table. 



Thby had "nudels" at a New 
York dinner, and Mr. Dana, of the 



Mr. Boucicault is said to be 
such an artist in cookery that he 
could give points to the best chefs in 
the country. Mr. Jefferson is very 
fond of griddle cakes; Salvini, of 
macaroni; Catherine and Jeffreys 
Lewis, of Frankfort sausage; and 
Patti has a weakness for onions — 
but " the weakness is so strong." 



"PLANKED SHAD." 



The approach of the season when 
Washington epicures can enjoy the 
luxury of "planked shad," reminds 
the correspondent of the St. Louis 
Globe - Democrat of the following 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



213 



story about Daniel Webster: "Web- 
ster was an artist in this line, and 
prided himself greatly upon his gifts. 
His only rival was an aged slave, a 
character on the river, called Sam. 
There were those who said that Sam 
was the only one who knew how to 
cook planked shad; others protested 
that the great statesman was supreme. 
On sunny spring days, when parties 
of gentlemen went down the river to 
watch the fish nailed to their boards, 
sizzling and browning before the 
blaze of an outdoor fire, it was ar- 
ranged to have a trial for the cham- 
pionship between old Sam and Mr. 
Webster. Each contestant was well 
backed, and the lights of those early 
political days were all there. First 
Sam split the shad, seasoned them as 
he knew would most suit Mr. Web- 
ster's taste, and laid them before the 
orator done to a turn. "Really, 
Sam, this is the best planked shad I 
have ever eaten," quoth Daniel; and 
applause rang from Sam's adherents. 
Next Webster laid aside his toga and 
hovered around the fire, knife and 
salt-box in hand, watching the shad 
that he had prepared in the way he 
knew would best suit Sam's taste. 
Sam ate three mouthf uls rapturously, 
and exclaimed: 'Fore God, Mr. 
Webster, I neber have tasted planked 
shad before !' Webster yielded grace- 
fully the palm to Sam, outdone by 
him in compliments as well as in 
cooking." 



"PLANKED" SHAD. 

Every little hotel and eating house 
fronting the Delaware at Gloucester 
has its specialty of "planked" shad. 
The fish, fresh from the stream, is 
cut in twain, fastened by tenpenny 
nails to a thick oak board, slanted 
toward a hot wood fire, duly basted 



and finally served at table on his oak 
gridiron. That the prince of Ame- 
rican fishes, served under these con- 
ditions and fianked by asparagus and 
kindred dainties, is at his best, goes 
without further saying. Daniel Web- 
ster, I have heard, used to plume 
himself more on his ability to "plank" 
a shad than on his highest oratorical 
flights. But if I may venture a per- 
sonal opinion against so famed an 
authority, the planked shad is not, 
after all, decidedly better than the 
same fish cooked prosaically on the 
domestic gridiron. He is fresher 
from the water, he is surrounded by 
the poetic novelty of odd cookery 
and service, and appetite is sharpened 
by the keen, watery air. Take these 
concomitants away, and the planked 
shad would lose half his fame. 



THE REAL VIENNA BREAD. 

Viennese bread is celebrated. It 
may interest you to know something 
about it. The excellence of the 
bread is attributed in Vienna to three 
reasons — the oven, the men and the 
yeast. I think another may be added, 
and that is the dry climate. An 
ounce of yeast (three decagrammes) 
and as much salt is taken for every 
gallon of milk used for the dough. 
The yeast is a Viennese specialty, 
known as the "St. Marxner Press- 
heffe," and its composition is a secret 
It keeps two days in summer and a 
little longer in winter. The ovens 
are heated by wood fires lighted 
inside them during four hours; the 
ashes are then raked out and the 
oven is carefully wiped with wisps of 
damp straw. On the vapor thus 
generated, as well as that produced 
by the baking of the dough, lies the 
whole art of the browning and the 
success of the " semmel."

"Yes," said Chef Ranhoffer, of 
Delmonico's, "we have a great de- 
mand for quail. We sold one hund- 
red a day and more before the sea- 
son ended. We could have given 
Mr. Walcott a quail cooked differ- 
ently every day in his match, thus 
agreeably relieving the monotony of 
his feat. A person would hardly 
believe this statement, but quail can 
be cooked in thirty-four different 



ways, 



at a cost to the eater of from 



seventy-five cents to two dollars for 
a single bird. We make them into 
soups, pies, stews and salmis, and add 
all kinds of sauces. In France a 
delicious way of cooking them is to 
wrap them with leaves and a piece 
of lard, bathe them in wine, and 
pour tomato sauce over them after 
they are cooked. Sometimes they 
are cooked with bay leaves, or they 
are treated in Spanish fashion and 
cooked with rice dressing. They 
can be stuffed like a regular fowl 
and treated with sauces until they 
are a luxury to the palate, and the 
diner will crave for a repetition." 



CREAM OR FONDANT. 



I presume from your question 
that the cream you speak of is what 
we call fondant, which article is the 
basis of all cream bonbons. This 
fondant is also used for covering or 
icing cakes and a great variety of 
what are called dipped goods. Fon- 
dant is made by boiling simple syrup 
to the forty-fifth degree by the sac- 
charometer; then pouring it on a 
very clean marble slab between iron 
bars, and when it has become nearly 
cold, so that you can place the back 
of your hand upon it without its ad- 
hering to it; it must be worked to 
and fro with a long-handled spatula 
until it granulates into a smooth 
mass, it must then with a knife be 



loosened from the marble and worked 
or broken with the hands into a soft- 
ish mass, and placed in an earthen- 
ware pan and covered. When you 
want to use it for icing purposes 
place the required quantity in a 
round-bottomed pan, place it upon a 
slow fire, and stir constantly with a 
small wooden spatula until it is thor- 
oughly melted, and there are no- 
lumps in it. Do not on any account 
allow it to boil, even a little, as that 
would entirely destroy its creamy 
texture and change it into hard con- 
serve; when melted pour it over the 
article to be covered and use a pallet 
knife to smooth it and facilitate your 
operation, which must be done quick- 
ly, as in a few moments it will be- 
gin to set and dry. The cake can 
then be decorated with ordinay egg- 
icing, or in any other way to suit 
your fancy. — Confectioner's your^

HOW TO PREPARE STUFFED EGG- 
PLANT. 



Mme. C. B. Waite's style is thus 
described by M. Xavier Wirtz, of 
the Societe Culinaire Philantro^ 
fique^ and as fine a chef as ever 
wore white cap and apron: Cut the 
top of the eggplant off, also a small 
piece from the bottom, so it will 
stand steadily, then cut out all the 
inside, as near the shell as possible 
without breaking it. Fill the shell 
with salt and water (to extract the 
bitterness) and let it stand until just 
before dinner time. Stew the inside 
with a little water, bread crumbs, 
butter, c^ayenne pepper, salt, spices 
and a small piece of onion cut very 
fine. Before dinner throw the water 
from the shell and fill it with the 
hot stuffing. Grate bread crumbs 
over the top, with a little butter, and 
put it into the oven for a few minutes 
to brown.

HOW TO SERVE POTATOES. 

A grand international potato ex- 
hibition was opened at the Crystal 
Palace yesterday afternoon by Mr. 
Alderman and Sheriff De Keyser, 
in the absence of the Lord Mayor. 
Ten years ago an association was 
formed for the encouragement of 
potato culture, and the introduction 
and diffusion of improved varieties. 
An annual exhibition has been held, 
and the result has been that not only 
has the number of exhibits increased, 
but the quality of the potatoes shown 
has greatly improved. At yester- 
day's show all the leading growers 
were represented, and the excellence 
of the specimens made the task of 
awarding the prizes no easy one. 
At a luncheon Mr. Shirley Hibbard 
remarked that there was still a great 
deal of ignorance shown in putting 
potatoes on the table. It was the 
usual practice to bring them up in a 
porcelain dish, with a close-fitting 
cover. In ten minutes the best po- 
tatoes, however carefully cooked, 
were thus utterly destroyed. He 
recommended that they should be 
placed in a wooden dish or served in 
a porcelain dish, with towels above 
and below to absorb the moisture. 



" D. C." WISHES to know how to 
pickle the small red and yellow to- 
matoes that are brought to market 
somewhat later in the season. If 
very small it is not necessary to re- 
move the skin, and you may proceed 
exactly as if for pickling peaches. 
Make a sirup of one quart of vinegar 
and seven pounds of sugar; let this 
come to a boil, add spices to suit your 
taste; put the tomatoes in a jar or in 
a porcelain kettle, having first re- 
moved the stems and wiped the fruit 
carefully ; then pour the hot sirup 
over them. If you wish them for 



use late in the Spring it is advisable 
to can them, as then they will keep 
perfectly. If you can them, put the 
porcelain kettle over the front of the 
stove, pour the hot sirup over, and 
let tlie fruit boil gently, but do not 
break it in pieces. If the fruit is 
very ripe and inclined to be soft, 
steam it before pouring the sirup 
over it; then you may can it im- 
mediately. 



Here is Rossini's receipt for cook- 
ing macaroni: Take a pound of ma- 
caroni and three parts cook it in salt 
and water, after which drain it well 
in a colander, throw away the water, 
put the macaroni back again into the 
stewpan in which it has been dressed, 
pour over it half a pint of good gravy 
or stock, place the stewpan at the 
side of the fire where it may keep 
hot, simmer, simmer, simmer and al- 
ways simmer, and from time to time 
shake the stewpan so that the maca- 
roni may be turned about, but be 
careful not to break it; when the 
gravy is entirely absorbed by the 
macaroni, put it in layers on a silver 
dish (this, of course, is a question of 
rank, earthenware doing just as well, 
perhaps better), between each layer 
spread some grated Parmesan cheese, 
with sliced truffles mixed with a good 
Espagnole sauce, and on the top or 
last layer put the truffles thicker; 
serve hot with grated Parmesan on 
a separate plate. 



ABOUT TRUFFLES. 



Truffles are subterranean in their 
habits, their position beneath the soil 
varying from two or three inches to 
two feet in depth. They have neither 
root, stem nor leaf, and are of differ- 
ent shades of color, from light brown 
to black. They are more or lees

Their surface is knotty or warty and 
covered with a skin of net work 
which looks like veins. Truffle? 
grow in pastures and on open downs, 
under trees and sometimes far away 
from them. They prefer loose soils 
and affect the neighborhood of oaks, 
beeches and chestnuts, but they do 
not thrive well in thick woods. They 
are common in Central and Southern 
Europe, particularly in this country, 
where the Poitou and Perigord dis- 
tricts are most prolific, and Italy, 
where Piedmont carries of the palm. 
The French truffles are decidedly 
superior to those of any country, but 
they vary in flavor according to lo- 
cality. Up in the neighborhood of 
Nancy or Bar-le-Duc they are gray- 
ish in color and nearly tasteless ; down 
near Grenoble, Valence and Av- 
ignon they have a musky taste; in 
Burgundy they are smaller, dry and 
have a flavor of resin, but the Peri- 
gord truffle is the kind that makes 
one's mouth water to think of it. 
Did you ever eat a Perigord pie? 
Well, without the presence of the 
thin slices of the Perigord tuber that 
delicious fate de foie gras would 
lose half its value. I have a loving 
remembrance of the flat de resist- 
ance of our national Thanksgiving 
Day, for a truffled turkey is quite a 
different bird from that stuffed with 
bread crumbs, sausage meat, boiled 
chestnuts and many other things. In 
the northern woods they are hunted 
for with dogs, but down in Perigord 
they train pigs for this purpose. It 
seems that pigs have better noses 
than dogs for this work. This is 
because the one likes truffles better 
as an article of food than the other, 
and a good truffle-hunting hog will 
fetch as much as $50. Of the same 
fungi family as truffles are the cham- 



pignons, which are now also in 
season, but which are not so plenti- 
ful in France as in some parts of 
Russia, where they are said to form 
the principal staples of food with the 
peasantry. 



A BATTLE WITH WILD HOGS. 



An Arkansas correspondent writes : 
Few people are aware that there are 
such things as wild hogs in this 
country, but such is the case, how- 
ever little the fact may be known. 
Not long since James Reynolds and 
myself were on a deer hunting ex- 
pedition on one of the numerous 
bayous that jut into Red river in the 
southeastern purt of Arkansas. We 
had with us two dogs, and were 
trailing along the bank of the bayou 
— the dogs some 200 or 300 yards in 
advance. All at once the dogs be- 
gan to bark, and there arose the 
greatest consternation imaginable. It 
did not take us long to determine 
the cause of all the commotion, as 
the dogs soon hove in sight, fighting 
and retreating toward us. Attacking 
them was a drove of wild, infuriated 
hogs, some of them so large and 
ferocious that a grizzly bear would 
be little more formidable. To say 
that they would strike terror to the 
bravest heart is but to make an as- 
sertion that would receive immediate 
credence of the reader should he 
ever be brought face to face with 
them. 

What was to be done? Here they 
came with a deafening and unearthly 
noise, their every bristle projecting 
forward, eyes maddened with rage, 
froth dripping from their mouths, 
and their long tusks ready to rip 
open any one or anything that of- 
fered combat. 

I suggested to Reynolds that we 
give them a volley from our four 



, COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



S17 



barrels at once, and perhaps it would 
so discomfit them that they would 
retreat. This we did when they 
were about two rods from us, and 
although we felled some three or 
four to the ground and crippled 
others, they seemed more enraged 
than ever and were on us before we 
could reload our guns. The only 
thing left for us to do was to take to 
the water (and very fortunate for us 
that we had water to take to) which 
we immediately did. Abandoning 
our guns' we plunged in and swam 
to the opposite shore, the live dog 
taking kindly to our example. 

Some little time after they had dis- 
appeared among the thick timber of 
the bottom, we swam back to our 
guns. After making an examination 
of the hogs we had dispatched, we 
concluded that we had all the bottom 
hunting that we desired that day, 
and struck out for the uplands. 

We learned that these wild hogs 
abound in considerable numbers 
along the bottoms of Red River and 
tributary streams in this locality. 

The tusks of the largest one that 
we killed (an old boar) projected 
fully four inches from the jaw, curv- 
ing outward and upward from their 
base on the upper jaw, and upward 
and outward on the lower. They 
are frequently hunted in the fall and 
winter after the mast has fallen and 
they have become fattened on it and 
make, it is said, fair bacon. 



ABOUT TERRAPIN. 



Sam Ward, during his reign at 
Washington as king of the Lobby, 
used to delight in treating epicurean 
foreigners to a thoroughly American 
dinner. His bill of fare was iced 
clams, fish chowder, stewed terrapin, 
canvas-back ducks, oysters on the 
half shell, hominy and Albany celery, 



with Chateau Yquem, dry cham- 
pagne, and old madeira from the 
Gadsby stock. In purchasing terra- 
pin, Mr. Ward would turn with dis- 
dain from the yellow-bills and the 
sliders, and purchase the diamond 
backs at twenty-five dollars a dozen. 
Having sent them to Welcher's, he 
would go into the kitchen and super- 
intend their preparation after the 
following formula: Immerse the 
terrapin in pure spring water, boiling 
hot, for five minutes, to loosen the 
skin. The skin is then removed with 
a knife, thoroughly polished first to 
free it from any foreign substance, 
with a piece of chamois leather. 
Then replace the terrapin in the 
boiling water, the temperature of 
which should be regulated by a 
thermometer. When the claws be- 
come so soft las to pinch into a pulp 
by a moderate pressure between the 
thumb and forefinger it is sufficiently 
boiled. Take them out and remove 
the bottom shell first, as the convex- 
ity of the upper shell catches the rich 
and savory juices which distinguish 
the terrapin from the mudturtle and 
the slider. Cut off the head and 
claws and carefully remove the gall 
and sand bag. A little of the gall 
does not impair the flavor of the ter- 
rapin, but the sand bag requires the 
skilful touch of a surgeon, and the 
heart of a lion, the eye of an eagle 
and the hand of a lady. Cut up the 
remainder into pieces about a half an 
inch in length. Be careful to pre- 
serve all the juice. Put in a chafing 
dish and add a dressing of fine flour, 
the yolk of eggs boiled so hard that 
they are mushy, quantum sufficit of 
butter fresh from the dairy, salt to 
taste, red pepper, a large wineglass 
of very old Madeira (to each terra- 
pin) and a small quantity of rich 
cream. The dish, like everythmg 
else fit to eat, except Roman punch 



818 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



and Stilton cheese, should be served 
smoking hot; some persons have 
been known to season with spices, 
but this, like the rank perfume which 
exhales from the handkerchief of 
under-bred people, is apt to arouse 
suspicion. Terrapin should be eaten 
only at night and then only by very 
honest men. To slightly paraphrase 
Dr. Boteler: "A better shell fish 
than the terrapin might have been 
made, but one never was made." — 
^^ Per ley'''* in Boston Budget. 



Efforts rather to preserve terra- 
pins than to propagate them have 
not yet been very successful. Ter- 
rapins may be kept in an enclosure 
from Summer to Winter, but it is at 
the sacrifice of their delicacy as food, 
penned terrapins losing their fine 
flavor and becoming , tough and 
stringy. Some years ago a discovery 
was made as to a new method of 
feeding terrapins. In Washington, 
where some terrapins had been put 
in a pond, a neighboring field of 
clover had been cut. Some of the 
clover having fallen from the scythe 
into the pond, the terrapins were 
seen to eat it with the same avidity 
as would a cow. 



TERRAPIN - FISHING. 

" Boil your terrapin for two hours, 
until the skin on the legs peels off; 
the pick the terrapin out of the shell 
and remove its gall-sac; then stew, 
by adding a quarter of a pound of 
butter, a taste of red pepper and the 
squeeze of a half lemon; put as much 
water as will stew, pour in a dash of 
sherry, and leave the rest to nature^'' 

Thus "Tommy" Boylan, of Guy's, 
in Baltimore, to the artist and the 
writer, and there is no better autho- 
rity on terrapin from Savannah to 
the Pata^sco River. 



Turtle may be fit for aldermen; 
but terrapin is food for princes, and 
a terrapin-stew might be served by 
Hebe to the immortal gods in high 
Olympus. 

Terrapin are caught from Savan- 
nah and Charleston up to the Pa- 
tapsco River at Baltimore, while the 
genuine "diamond-back" is only to 
be found in the upper Chesapeake 
and its tributaries. A diamond-back 
never measures less than seven inches 
in length on the under shell, a seven- 
inch being known as a " count ter- 
rapin," while anything under the 
length of a " count " does not count. 
Ten inches long and eight pounds in 
weight is reckoned a very large ter- 
rapin, the seven-inches weighing, on 
an average, four pounds. 

During the season, terrapins sell 
for $30 to $38 per dozen; while 
"sliders" — common river turtles, 
principally caught in the James 
River — which sell at from $6 to $8 
per dozen, are palmed off by skill- 
ful restaurateurs as genuine diamond- 
backs on unwary but ambitious 
guests, at a dollar and a half the 
dish. 

The male terrapin is known as the 
"bull," the female as the "cow," the 
lady being more in request on account 
of her thirty eggs, which are used to 
garnish the delectable dish. 

The artist and I having consigned 
our lives and limbs to the custody of 
the darkest darkey my eyes ever 
alighted upon, and to the most rickety 
of crazy skiffs, were paddled up a 
small tributary of the Chesapeake 
Bay, situated at about six miles from 
Annapolis, on a terrapin-searching 
expedition. Having quitted the sanc- 
tuary of the boat for the more genial 
atmosphere of the mud, our darkey, 
who was armed with a long, thin 
pole, commenced to probe the bot- 
tom — he was wading waist-deep — or, 



COOKING FOR PROFIT. 



219 



to use the technical term, to "sound" 
for terrapin. His practiced sense of 
touch tells him when he taps terra- 
pin, and if they are numerous, he 
marks his prey, and returns to grab 
them with a net. 

On this occasion the " birds " — as 
bon viveurs love to call them, although 
terrapin is used as fish by the most 
devout Catholics in the severest or 
Lenten time — were plentiful, and our 
darkey, having put us ashore, very 
soon returned with a boat containing 
his mate, nets, sounding-poles, rakes 
and other impedi?nenta of his calling, 
a business that pays the catcher, 
according to luck, from $5 to $50 a 
week. 

The haul, which was watched by 
a luckless fisherman with consider- 
able envy, proved a good one, the 
ground being literally cut from under 
the feet of the terrapin, and there 
were vast expansive grins, accom- 
panied by chuckles loud and deep, as 
the well- laden boat rowed back with 
its precious freight to the quaint old 
capital of Maryland. 

Terrapins are jealously guarded 
by the law, and a stringent Act 
exists which protects diamond-back 
terrapin in the waters of the State of 
Maryland. The fishing opens on 
the first of November and terminates 
on the thirty-first of March. It is 
unlawful to catch any terrapin of a 
size less than five inches on the bot- 
tom of the shell, or to interfere with 
or destroy the diamond-back terra- 
pin's eggs. It is stated that thirty 
years ago the dealers found it diffi- 
cult to sell terrapin at $6 a dozen, 
and now the difl5culty lies in obtain- 
ing them at any price. Their num- 
bers are rapidly decreasing, and un- 
less some effective protective means 
are forthwith taken, a terrapin will 
indeed prove a rara avis in terris. 

Sliders are plentiful in the tribut- 



aries of the Chesapeake, as also are 
"snappers." Turtles are fished for 
in this way: The fisherman plants 
poles, sometimes a hundred, in the 
middle of the stream ; to each pole 
he fastens a line, to which is attached 
a hook baited with salted eel. The 
snapper grabs bait and hook, and is 
hauled up, always vicious and despe- 
rate. 

The fishermen around these trib- 
utaries take a thousand pounds' 
weight of turtle a week, which they 
sell at ten cents a pound. The snap- 
pers' eggs, about the size of marbles, 
are considered a great delicacy. 

Apropos of turtle and terrapin, the 
following is the menu of a perfect 
Maryland dinner, as arranged by 
"one of the knowing ones": 

"Four small oysters from Lyn- 
haven Bay ; terrapin a la Maryland ; 
canvas-back ducks; a small salad of 
crab and lettuce. Vegetables — baked 
Irish potatoes; fried hominy cakes 
and plain celery." — Magazine, 



THE CONSUMPTION OF ICE CREAM. 



Enormous quantities of ice cream 
are consumed every day in New 
York city in warm wether. On the 
Fourth of July the supply, though 
unusually large, was nearly exhausted 
by ten o'clock at night. Ice cream, 
like ice, in old times used to be con- 
sidered a luxury in New York in- 
stead of a necessity, and old Gotham- 
ites recall with pleasure the memories 
of Vauxhall Garden, Niblo's, Castle 
Garden and other open-air resorts 
where ice cream, ices and Roman 
punches were served during the dog 
days. In those days a quarter of a 
dollar was considered a fair evening's 
investment for a young man treating 
a single fair friend, as the highest 
price for ice cream was "sixpence" 
a plate, and an ice was thrown in 



920 



COOKING FOR PROFIT, 



for a " shilling." A first-rate Prin- 
dpa cigar for two cents would top 
off the treat. 

The old times have changed and 
the cool gardens have vanished. Ice 
cream is now considered as much of 
a necessity as ice, and is served as 
regularly at the tables of private 
families as at hotels and restaurants. 
Gardens have given place to "sa- 
loons," where ice cream, ices and 
cakes are exclusively served. Some 
of the most aristocratic of these 
saloons are elegantly and expensively 
furnished, and some are in the rear 
of bakeries and confectionary stores. 
From Fifth avenue to Grand street, 
however, all are alike in having 
marble-top tallies and one or more 
gilt mirrors. It is a singular fact 
that every ice cream saloon, whether 
of high or low degree, has a gilt- 
framed mirror and marble-top tables, 
and palm-leaf fans are also much 
affected. 

It is not merely the wealthy or 
those in moderate circumstances who 
cat ice cream. From the costly pist- 
ache or Neapolitaine brick there is 
a gradual descent to ice cream at ten 
cents a plate on the extreme east and 
west sides. Then by a sudden bound 
an open-air tariff of one or two cents 
a plate is reached, so that the cooling 
cream is within the means of every 
street urchin. The plates are small 
and no spoons are furnished, and the 
ice cream is sometimes a trifle gritty, 
but still it is ice cream. 

A large manufacturer said : " You 
might as well try to find out how 
many cigan are smoked or how 



many cups of coffee or tea are used 
every day as try to find out how 
much ice cream is consumed. I can 
tell you how much I sell daily, but 
there are several other large manu- 
facturers. We supply a good many 
hotels and restaurants, but many 
other hotels and restaurants make 
their own ice cream. We supply 
hundreds of private families, but 
hundreds more have their own ice 
cream freezers. You see it's a big 
business. What are the prices ? Well, 
the regular standard price for ice 
cream is forty cents for a single 
quart, but church fairs, picnics and 
excursions are supplied in large 
quantities at twenty.five cents a 
quart. The regular retail price is 
fifteen cents a plate, but many fairs 
and picnics sell small plates for ten 
cents. Ours is a good, pure article 
of cream; but, of course, fancy ice 
creams are sold at wholesale and 
retail for more than double our rates. 
We sell to customers outside of the 
city, and have now an order for five 
hundred quarts to go some distance 
out on Long Island. 

" The sale of ice cream varies, of 
course, with the weather, but it is a 
staple article of consumption all the 
year round. Some families use 
twenty to thirty quarts a week, and 
even then their youngsters will come 
and buy it in boxes. Healthy ? Why, 
there is nothing more healthy than 
pure ice cream. Many people actu- 
ally eat it at breakfast. Vanilla is 
the standard flavor, but we sell large 
quantities of strawberry, chocolate 
and other flavors.''
